[SPEAKER_18]: The following live program is a special presentation of Orange Lounge Radio.

Tonight on Orange Lounge Radio, live, it is episode number 150!

5
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,021
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is a landmark number.

6
00:01:27,622 --> 00:01:33,047
[SPEAKER_05]: And to celebrate this landmark occasion, we're going to do the same old crap we always do.

7
00:01:33,547 --> 00:01:39,112
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to sit on here and pretend to do a show about DDR and never talk about it throughout the whole three hours.

8
00:01:39,292 --> 00:01:44,477
[SPEAKER_06]: And we'll find out what the difference between white bread and rustic white bread actually is.

9
00:01:44,497 --> 00:01:44,978
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

10
00:01:45,038 --> 00:01:47,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Radio bringing you the news you really want to know.

11
00:01:47,992 --> 00:01:50,573
[SPEAKER_05]: about games that we're supposed to be talking about, but we're not.

12
00:01:50,974 --> 00:01:52,214
[SPEAKER_05]: For the past 150 episodes.

13
00:01:52,234 --> 00:01:52,454
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

14
00:01:53,035 --> 00:01:59,658
[SPEAKER_05]: In all seriousness, we have brand new MP3s from Happy Sky for those three of you people who haven't already torrented them.

15
00:02:00,458 --> 00:02:04,981
[SPEAKER_05]: We have some news on something I wanted to say.

16
00:02:05,001 --> 00:02:05,841
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, the lawsuit.

17
00:02:05,881 --> 00:02:11,364
[SPEAKER_05]: There's more stuff about the lawsuit because we didn't get bitched at enough for talking about the lawsuit too much last week.

18
00:02:11,784 --> 00:02:14,546
[SPEAKER_05]: All this and more tonight after this brief introduction.

19
00:02:14,606 --> 00:02:16,987
[SPEAKER_05]: Yada, yada, yada, yada, yada, yada, yada.

28
00:03:41,316 --> 00:03:45,039
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Radio will not contain any of that in this episode.

29
00:03:45,119 --> 00:03:46,981

00:04:41,233 --> 00:04:42,293

37
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:43,494

38
00:04:44,015 --> 00:04:46,177
[SPEAKER_05]: Joining me, as always, are my awesome co-hosts.

39
00:04:46,517 --> 00:04:50,841
[SPEAKER_05]: In this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm is Jamie Summers, also known as DarkSakura.

40
00:04:56,118 --> 00:04:57,619
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, she's not here right now.

41
00:04:57,699 --> 00:05:05,663
[SPEAKER_05]: She, in true Orange Lounge Radio fashion, whenever we have like a really big show number, like a landmark show, she's off doing something else.

42
00:05:05,923 --> 00:05:10,345
[SPEAKER_05]: She will be here tonight, boys and girls, she'll just be a little late, because there's a birthday in the family.

43
00:05:11,226 --> 00:05:19,830
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's grandma or aunt or somebody's having a birthday, so she's off there, but she'll be here around the 7 o'clock hour, so she's probably on her way right now.

44
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:22,871
[SPEAKER_05]: But we do have the one and only Tech Massa Loki!

45
00:05:23,752 --> 00:05:24,312
[SPEAKER_05]: I am here.

46
00:05:25,153 --> 00:05:25,833
[SPEAKER_05]: And how are you doing?

47
00:05:26,446 --> 00:05:27,887
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, okay, I guess.

48
00:05:28,067 --> 00:05:29,909
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, did you go on a diet or something?

49
00:05:30,529 --> 00:05:30,729
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

50
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:33,191
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you used to bring in the Pizza Hut every night.

51
00:05:33,211 --> 00:05:33,632
[SPEAKER_06]: Pizza yesterday.

52
00:05:33,832 --> 00:05:35,173
[SPEAKER_05]: And now you brought in the Togos.

53
00:05:35,313 --> 00:05:36,114
[SPEAKER_06]: I had pizza yesterday.

54
00:05:36,134 --> 00:05:36,374
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I see.

55
00:05:36,674 --> 00:05:36,934
[SPEAKER_06]: I see.

56
00:05:37,695 --> 00:05:38,015
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

57
00:05:38,536 --> 00:05:42,919
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we do have the one and only, uh, Loki's fiancÃ© with us tonight.

58
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:43,439
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi.

59
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,743
[SPEAKER_05]: So she's gonna fill in for Jamie, giving us the female perspective.

60
00:05:48,363 --> 00:05:50,825
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello, I'm Jamie, I hope she's not listening.

61
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:51,626
[SPEAKER_05]: No, she's not.

62
00:05:51,866 --> 00:05:55,909
[SPEAKER_05]: But, I have to know, um, what are your favorite video games?

63
00:06:00,726 --> 00:06:01,567
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, Matt.

64
00:06:01,907 --> 00:06:02,407
[SPEAKER_06]: Tetris?

65
00:06:02,727 --> 00:06:03,708
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Tetris!

66
00:06:04,308 --> 00:06:05,149
[SPEAKER_07]: I like Tetris.

67
00:06:05,169 --> 00:06:06,229
[SPEAKER_06]: She also likes Zookeeper.

68
00:06:06,729 --> 00:06:08,771
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, and I like Zookeeper and I like Pac-Man.

69
00:06:09,331 --> 00:06:10,431
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think of DDR?

70
00:06:13,153 --> 00:06:15,594
[SPEAKER_07]: It kind of looks like line dancing.

71
00:06:16,315 --> 00:06:20,957
[SPEAKER_07]: Because when you have the two people and there's... It kind of does, don't you think?

72
00:06:21,718 --> 00:06:22,358
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of.

73
00:06:22,698 --> 00:06:23,158
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of.

74
00:06:23,579 --> 00:06:26,040
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you just have to do little heel clicking.

75
00:06:27,281 --> 00:06:29,302
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yes, it's going to be a fun show tonight, boys and girls.

76
00:06:30,578 --> 00:06:32,539
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be back after this brief introduction.

77
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:36,680
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to play some MP3s from the new Happy Sky soundtrack.

78
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,420
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy Sky!

79
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,121
[SPEAKER_05]: Does that make you a Happy Sky?

80
00:06:39,621 --> 00:06:43,662
[SPEAKER_05]: No, actually, I'll tell you what I think about 2DX12 style in a little bit.

81
00:06:44,022 --> 00:06:44,442
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

82
00:06:45,923 --> 00:06:47,583
[SPEAKER_05]: I do like this first song we're going to play.

83
00:06:47,623 --> 00:06:50,024
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to start it off with a remix of Thunder.

84
00:06:51,525 --> 00:06:54,346
[SPEAKER_05]: A new DJ Taka song from Happy Sky.

85
00:06:54,766 --> 00:06:56,386
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, not the same Thunder I thought it was.

86
00:06:56,946 --> 00:06:58,347
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but it's that...

87
00:07:01,805 --> 00:07:03,467
[SPEAKER_05]: You know the one everybody used to play on ASL?

88
00:07:03,507 --> 00:07:04,348
[SPEAKER_05]: Such a horrid song.

89
00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:05,250
[SPEAKER_05]: Such a horrid song.

90
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:06,471
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they remixed it for Happy Sky.

91
00:07:07,012 --> 00:07:07,613
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to play that.

92
00:07:08,715 --> 00:07:09,035
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll see.

93
00:07:09,075 --> 00:07:09,396
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll see.

94
00:07:09,476 --> 00:07:10,618
[SPEAKER_05]: You're the recognizer or you don't.

95
00:07:10,978 --> 00:07:11,639
[SPEAKER_05]: Inazuma.

96
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:12,541
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be back after this.

97
00:09:44,747 --> 00:09:45,149
Thank you.

98
00:10:49,842 --> 00:10:53,366
Thanks for watching!

99
00:11:50,038 --> 00:11:50,948
Thanks for watching!

100
00:13:52,578 --> 00:13:53,479
Thanks for watching!

101
00:14:53,885 --> 00:15:00,967
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for watching!

102
00:15:26,212 --> 00:15:30,790
[SPEAKER_05]: And as a homosexual, I'm going to say Happy Sky is the gayest name I've ever heard.

103
00:15:31,372 --> 00:15:31,673
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

104
00:15:32,984 --> 00:15:35,466
[SPEAKER_03]: Super Happy American Dad's Party!

105
00:15:35,486 --> 00:15:40,710
[SPEAKER_05]: In that break, we heard DJ Taco with Inazuma, which is a remix of Thunder.

106
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:44,792
[SPEAKER_05]: And I got bitched at in the chatroom because, you know, Jazz came in and was like, Nuh-uh!

107
00:15:45,013 --> 00:15:46,434
[SPEAKER_05]: You did not just bash on Thunder!

108
00:15:46,454 --> 00:15:46,794
[SPEAKER_05]: Nuh-uh!

109
00:15:46,854 --> 00:15:47,334
[SPEAKER_05]: No, you didn't!

110
00:15:47,895 --> 00:15:49,616
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um, okay, I like Thunder.

111
00:15:49,896 --> 00:15:50,537
[SPEAKER_05]: I like it a lot.

112
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:54,539
[SPEAKER_05]: But let's face it, that song was horrid when 2DX8Style was that.

113
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:55,920
[SPEAKER_05]: It was that and Beauty of Silence.

114
00:15:56,321 --> 00:15:57,682
[SPEAKER_05]: And I love Beauty of Silence, too.

115
00:15:58,442 --> 00:15:59,723
[SPEAKER_05]: But those songs were all horrid.

116
00:16:00,284 --> 00:16:00,384
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

117
00:16:01,104 --> 00:16:08,172
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, I was having trouble paying attention to those songs because Nelly here keeps trying to violate me with this stupid Ethernet cable.

118
00:16:08,192 --> 00:16:08,873
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, hey, hey, hey.

119
00:16:09,313 --> 00:16:11,215
[SPEAKER_05]: Stop sticking that Cat5 up his pants.

120
00:16:11,315 --> 00:16:15,119
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got to put that... I stuck it up Rob's butt a minute ago and he didn't even notice it.

121
00:16:16,881 --> 00:16:17,762
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you, Rob?

122
00:16:17,922 --> 00:16:19,204
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I try and do the show here, please?

123
00:16:19,224 --> 00:16:19,464
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

124
00:16:19,664 --> 00:16:19,965
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

125
00:16:21,309 --> 00:16:35,396
[SPEAKER_05]: After that break, also in that set, Ryu with In Motion, Mr. T with Vault of Heaven, and the one more extra stage, oh my gods, Amuro vs. Killer with Mei, which means dark in Japanese.

126
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:36,937
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what else it means?

127
00:16:37,117 --> 00:16:39,378
[SPEAKER_06]: It means, I made the same song three times!

128
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:40,179
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what it means.

129
00:16:41,119 --> 00:16:44,361
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me just run my hand up and down the piano again.

130
00:16:44,381 --> 00:16:46,222
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously, it's the same damn beat!

131
00:16:46,302 --> 00:16:48,703
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I made a song with piano in it!

132
00:16:48,723 --> 00:16:50,184
[SPEAKER_05]: Here, I'm going to run my hand up and down the piano.

133
00:16:50,956 --> 00:16:51,696
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh wait, no, that's not the part.

134
00:16:53,017 --> 00:16:59,481
[SPEAKER_05]: Where's the part that has the... Here we go.

135
00:16:59,641 --> 00:17:01,222
[SPEAKER_05]: See?

136
00:17:01,602 --> 00:17:11,887
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know that's just going to be key presses all over the place, and people are only going to be able to beat it by putting it on random unless you're just insane at 2DX, which, you know, if that's the case, then more power to you.

137
00:17:14,649 --> 00:17:14,869
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

138
00:17:15,484 --> 00:17:15,805
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

139
00:17:16,145 --> 00:17:20,651
[SPEAKER_05]: Me personally, I haven't really sat down and listened to all the Happy Sky MP3s.

140
00:17:21,032 --> 00:17:21,773
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not cool.

141
00:17:21,933 --> 00:17:23,535
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't get the MP3s earlier in the week.

142
00:17:23,635 --> 00:17:26,740
[SPEAKER_05]: I just got them last night, so I haven't had a chance to listen to all of them.

143
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,984
[SPEAKER_05]: But the ones I did listen to, I was kind of like...

144
00:17:31,954 --> 00:17:33,255
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

145
00:17:49,874 --> 00:17:51,156
[SPEAKER_05]: Even with 2DX Red, I was kind of...

146
00:18:13,447 --> 00:18:14,928
[SPEAKER_05]: 2DX is going the way of Guitar Freaks

147
00:18:42,377 --> 00:18:45,399
[SPEAKER_06]: It was some cool song, or crappy song, I mean.

148
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:51,703
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um, so now, um, I don't know, The Killer sounds like something like a metal band.

149
00:18:52,184 --> 00:18:55,926
[SPEAKER_06]: And that would have been awesome, like, you know, heavy metal guitars with the piano, I guess.

150
00:18:56,086 --> 00:18:56,967
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that would have been cool.

151
00:18:57,227 --> 00:18:59,268
[SPEAKER_06]: But that was, what did he do?

152
00:18:59,568 --> 00:19:01,510
[SPEAKER_06]: The Killer's like, I'm gonna speed the tempo up.

153
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:02,210
[SPEAKER_06]: Look, I'm done.

154
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:03,231
[SPEAKER_06]: That was it.

155
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:04,171
[SPEAKER_06]: That was my contribution.

156
00:19:06,893 --> 00:19:07,574
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

157
00:19:07,914 --> 00:19:08,034
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

158
00:19:09,264 --> 00:19:11,466
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, anyway, so that's my rant on Happy Sky.

159
00:19:11,486 --> 00:19:14,668
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, you honestly wonder, yeah, we need one more extra stage song.

160
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:15,188
[SPEAKER_06]: Ugh!

161
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:21,693
[SPEAKER_06]: Fine, let's take a piece of that, piece of that, speed it up, up, done.

162
00:19:21,733 --> 00:19:24,895
[SPEAKER_05]: There are a couple songs in 2DX Happy Sky I do kind of like.

163
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:28,417
[SPEAKER_05]: I liked the Thunder remix because I loved the original Thunder.

164
00:19:28,537 --> 00:19:30,619
[SPEAKER_05]: Even though it was horrid, so horrid.

165
00:19:30,779 --> 00:19:32,120
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I liked it until she started singing.

166
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,042
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the part that comes from Thunder.

167
00:19:35,542 --> 00:19:36,983
[SPEAKER_05]: The rest of it's all different.

168
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:38,204
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah, that's why.

169
00:19:42,455 --> 00:19:48,498
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be like having the intro part there and then also let the move breaks in there.

170
00:19:48,518 --> 00:19:49,838
[SPEAKER_06]: It just doesn't fit.

171
00:19:50,199 --> 00:19:51,219
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the same with that.

172
00:19:51,619 --> 00:19:58,203
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, remember Ultramix 2 and it had a remix of Make a Jam, which wasn't bad.

173
00:19:58,543 --> 00:20:00,444
[SPEAKER_05]: It was actually kind of cool, the Make a Jam remix.

174
00:20:00,464 --> 00:20:00,944
[SPEAKER_05]: You remember that?

175
00:20:01,624 --> 00:20:04,446
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody could remix Let Them Move and make it a good song.

176
00:20:04,486 --> 00:20:05,246
[SPEAKER_05]: They really could.

177
00:20:05,326 --> 00:20:06,407
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just nobody wants to.

178
00:20:07,384 --> 00:20:07,884
[SPEAKER_05]: or something.

179
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:08,324
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

180
00:20:08,344 --> 00:20:10,305
[SPEAKER_05]: No, Let Them Move could be remixed into a good song.

181
00:20:10,365 --> 00:20:10,625
[SPEAKER_05]: Please.

182
00:20:10,946 --> 00:20:15,667
[SPEAKER_05]: If they could make Make a Jam a good song, Let Them Move remix for Ultramix 3.

183
00:20:16,308 --> 00:20:16,648
[SPEAKER_06]: Please.

184
00:20:16,668 --> 00:20:17,088
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.

185
00:20:17,408 --> 00:20:19,309
[SPEAKER_06]: And Michael Jackson can make a comeback too.

186
00:20:19,389 --> 00:20:19,869
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

187
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:22,670
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

188
00:20:24,031 --> 00:20:27,953
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll start off tonight's show as we usually like to start off the show playing a little bit of How was your week?

189
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:28,653
[SPEAKER_06]: How was your day?

190
00:20:29,433 --> 00:20:30,674
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, how was your week?

191
00:20:30,714 --> 00:20:31,134
[SPEAKER_05]: How was your day?

192
00:20:32,114 --> 00:20:32,634
[SPEAKER_06]: It sucks.

193
00:20:33,855 --> 00:20:36,356
[SPEAKER_06]: It started off good and then it just ended up crappy.

194
00:20:37,043 --> 00:20:38,424
[SPEAKER_06]: I had to go do that.

195
00:20:38,504 --> 00:20:39,845
[SPEAKER_06]: Luckily, ironically enough or whatever...

196
00:21:05,109 --> 00:21:07,370
[SPEAKER_06]: The air conditioning stopped working in our apartment.

197
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:17,474
[SPEAKER_06]: Luckily, we're in another house, so it doesn't really matter right now, but... No, this is the second time it's happened since we've lived there, so... That's not good.

198
00:21:17,674 --> 00:21:19,635
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, um... What else?

199
00:21:19,775 --> 00:21:19,875
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh!

200
00:21:21,335 --> 00:21:24,336
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the dog is on this weird routine, because my mom works weird hours.

201
00:21:24,376 --> 00:21:26,037
[SPEAKER_06]: She works, you know, really early in the morning.

202
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:29,879
[SPEAKER_06]: Gives up, like, four in the morning, so the dog wakes me up three times during the night.

203
00:21:29,939 --> 00:21:33,420
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, once at eleven, once at three...

204
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:42,092
[SPEAKER_06]: once at 7, and then once at 10, it's just like, knock it off, and like, she'll wake you up, and you're like, okay, you want to go outside?

205
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:59,741
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope, just staring at you, just, I don't want anything, I just wanted to wake you up, it's fucking annoying, so, that sucked, and then, I don't know, really, other than that, not too much has been going on at work, it's been okay, I've been just kind of

206
00:22:01,016 --> 00:22:06,381
[SPEAKER_06]: Trying to pay attention to work as much as possible and not, you know, fiddle with my PSP.

207
00:22:07,102 --> 00:22:10,525
[SPEAKER_06]: Because people want me to put games on there because they outed me as saying it.

208
00:22:10,645 --> 00:22:13,988
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, that guy knows how to put Nintendo games on your PSP.

209
00:22:14,468 --> 00:22:17,071
[SPEAKER_06]: So everybody calls it, or walks up to me, are you busy?

210
00:22:18,252 --> 00:22:19,273
[SPEAKER_06]: Put games on it.

211
00:22:21,315 --> 00:22:22,496
[SPEAKER_06]: So I have to constantly do that.

212
00:22:23,257 --> 00:22:25,779
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, it's cool, you know.

213
00:22:26,385 --> 00:22:31,146
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's wonderful that you work for the game distributor and you're a big old pirate when it comes to things like that.

214
00:22:31,206 --> 00:22:32,006
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, seriously.

215
00:22:32,526 --> 00:22:38,708
[SPEAKER_05]: There are pirates inside every company and they wonder why this stuff turns up on the internet days after release.

216
00:22:38,728 --> 00:22:39,588
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't pirate games.

217
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:41,309
[SPEAKER_05]: Much.

218
00:22:41,329 --> 00:22:43,949
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't pirate any games.

219
00:22:44,909 --> 00:22:46,630
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not the person that puts them on the internet.

220
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:48,390
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just the person that downloads them off the internet.

221
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:49,771
[SPEAKER_05]: And shares them with all your coworkers.

222
00:22:49,971 --> 00:22:54,232
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't... Okay, I share the Nintendo games with them, but you know what?

223
00:22:55,372 --> 00:22:56,052
[SPEAKER_06]: They're so small.

224
00:22:56,923 --> 00:22:58,984
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, I don't know.

225
00:22:59,004 --> 00:23:00,645
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, Loki, are you busy?

226
00:23:00,685 --> 00:23:01,965
[SPEAKER_05]: Could you come rob a bank with me?

227
00:23:02,785 --> 00:23:07,327
[SPEAKER_06]: These other games that I'm testing out are just games that aren't coming out over here yet.

228
00:23:07,487 --> 00:23:08,948
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all Japanese games on my PSP.

229
00:23:09,228 --> 00:23:13,490
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, I should say that my PSP has four commercial games on the memory card itself.

230
00:23:14,871 --> 00:23:16,231
[SPEAKER_05]: Your internet penis is huge.

231
00:23:16,271 --> 00:23:16,991
[SPEAKER_05]: Congratulations.

232
00:23:17,432 --> 00:23:18,492
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

233
00:23:19,633 --> 00:23:23,794
[SPEAKER_06]: And, yeah, so that's pretty much my week.

234
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:25,395
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been just that, so...

235
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:28,791
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I forgot.

236
00:23:29,332 --> 00:23:31,794
[SPEAKER_06]: Yesterday we had our bad movie night.

237
00:23:31,814 --> 00:23:32,374
[SPEAKER_06]: It was pretty cool.

238
00:23:34,556 --> 00:23:37,118
[SPEAKER_06]: It came from somewhere else, which was really retarded.

239
00:23:37,318 --> 00:23:42,342
[SPEAKER_06]: All the gore and nudity scenes were all in color, but the rest of the movie was black and white.

240
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:47,166
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we started watching this movie called Hanzo the Razor or something like that.

241
00:23:47,686 --> 00:23:54,271
[SPEAKER_06]: And I highly recommend no one watches this, because I thought, okay, samurai exploitation movie or something like that.

242
00:23:54,792 --> 00:23:56,313
[SPEAKER_06]: It was made in the 70s or whatever.

243
00:23:57,364 --> 00:23:59,906
[SPEAKER_06]: and Hanzo's like torturing himself, you know, first.

244
00:24:00,246 --> 00:24:10,414
[SPEAKER_06]: Then all of a sudden, out of nowhere, he's pouring hot water on his penis and then puts it on a Lego board and starts beating it with a stick and then starts screwing a bag of rock salt.

245
00:24:10,454 --> 00:24:12,575
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, what the hell are you watching?

246
00:24:12,996 --> 00:24:14,557
[SPEAKER_06]: Why did you make me watch this?

247
00:24:14,997 --> 00:24:18,740
[SPEAKER_06]: And the whole movie, I read the back, I'm like, oh my god, why are we watching this thing?

248
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:23,884
[SPEAKER_06]: So we turn that off and then we watch Attack the Gas Station, which that movie is awesome.

249
00:24:23,964 --> 00:24:26,005
[SPEAKER_06]: So, it ended on a good note.

250
00:24:26,326 --> 00:24:26,746
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um,

251
00:24:27,714 --> 00:24:29,856
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Hanzo the Razor, don't watch it.

252
00:24:30,216 --> 00:24:30,676
[SPEAKER_06]: Awful movie.

253
00:24:32,297 --> 00:24:32,998
[SPEAKER_06]: That was my week.

254
00:24:35,339 --> 00:24:36,320
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, sounds good.

255
00:24:39,843 --> 00:24:40,903
[SPEAKER_03]: Who made you watch that movie?

256
00:24:41,344 --> 00:24:42,044
[SPEAKER_06]: My friend Jason.

257
00:24:42,224 --> 00:24:44,566
[SPEAKER_06]: He brought it over, he said this movie's awesome.

258
00:24:44,646 --> 00:24:45,487
[SPEAKER_06]: He didn't even watch it.

259
00:24:45,527 --> 00:24:46,047
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, dude.

260
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:48,229
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're like, oh, come on.

261
00:24:48,589 --> 00:24:54,893
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, he didn't even, like, showed it, but it was kind of blurred out, you know, out of focus.

262
00:24:54,953 --> 00:24:55,454
[SPEAKER_06]: But he's just all...

263
00:24:57,102 --> 00:24:58,383
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

264
00:25:14,958 --> 00:25:17,780
[SPEAKER_06]: Ugly damn people in this movie, but no one wanted to watch it.

265
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,781
[SPEAKER_05]: Santa Claus saves the day.

266
00:25:18,881 --> 00:25:22,803
[SPEAKER_05]: Have I ever made you watch Desperate Living, one of my favorite movies, John Waters?

267
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:23,223
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

268
00:25:23,484 --> 00:25:27,886
[SPEAKER_05]: With the amazingly humongous black woman that's like full-frontally nude through a lot of the movie?

269
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:30,888
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I probably would enjoy the movie just because I enjoy weird movies.

270
00:25:30,908 --> 00:25:31,229
[SPEAKER_05]: It's awesome.

271
00:25:31,249 --> 00:25:31,749
[SPEAKER_05]: Something like that.

272
00:25:31,869 --> 00:25:33,430
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like one of my favorite movies ever.

273
00:25:34,291 --> 00:25:35,571
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there's another one I'm getting.

274
00:25:35,591 --> 00:25:38,593
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't paid for it yet, but it's inbred.

275
00:25:39,134 --> 00:25:41,055
[SPEAKER_06]: Or is it Bloodsucking Vampire Rednecks?

276
00:25:41,955 --> 00:25:42,796
[SPEAKER_06]: That's going to be coming.

277
00:25:42,876 --> 00:25:43,677
[SPEAKER_06]: If you look up the...

278
00:25:44,932 --> 00:25:52,361
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, let me just say there's this really ginormous person in this movie that's nude in it as well, and she must weigh like 600 pounds.

279
00:25:52,541 --> 00:25:53,182
[SPEAKER_06]: I kid you not.

280
00:25:53,242 --> 00:25:56,005
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you and I need to go to that Trash Film Orgy sometime.

281
00:25:56,085 --> 00:25:56,726
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god.

282
00:25:56,746 --> 00:26:00,310
[SPEAKER_05]: They do this thing here in Sacramento where, you know, we all live and the show's based...

283
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:06,851
[SPEAKER_05]: They do this trash film orgy at the big artsy theater downtown and they show all these really horrid, horrid movies.

284
00:26:07,231 --> 00:26:14,093
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, this old friend of mine that I used to do Rocky Horror with way back in the day, she is like the trash film queen or whatever.

285
00:26:14,473 --> 00:26:24,295
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm surfing MySpace yesterday and I see this picture and it says the trash film queen and all it is is a picture of breasts with stickers taping over it.

286
00:26:24,355 --> 00:26:26,195
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, dude, that's Sarah!

287
00:26:26,215 --> 00:26:26,275
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes!

288
00:26:28,496 --> 00:26:28,816
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes!

289
00:26:30,695 --> 00:26:36,440
[SPEAKER_05]: But the scary thing is, I recognized a picture of a girl from the breasts alone and nothing else.

290
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,641
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty odd.

291
00:26:37,681 --> 00:26:41,224
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but those are huge-ass tits, so you can see them from... She's awesome, though.

292
00:26:41,284 --> 00:26:41,564
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

293
00:26:41,744 --> 00:26:49,371
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, I just wanted... I know this is great radio, but I wanted to show you a picture of this woman that's in this movie.

294
00:26:49,531 --> 00:26:55,296
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is the reason why... This movie is just so awful, but let me see here.

295
00:26:55,316 --> 00:26:57,057
[SPEAKER_06]: There it is right there.

296
00:27:01,294 --> 00:27:04,875
[SPEAKER_06]: She basically sits on some guy's head and it, like, kills him.

297
00:27:05,575 --> 00:27:06,716
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I look like naked.

298
00:27:06,736 --> 00:27:07,156
[SPEAKER_06]: See, look at that.

299
00:27:09,437 --> 00:27:11,838
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so can you post a link in our chatroom to that?

300
00:27:11,858 --> 00:27:12,098
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.

301
00:27:12,178 --> 00:27:14,038
[SPEAKER_05]: No, you're not in the chatroom, are you?

302
00:27:14,238 --> 00:27:15,739
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not in the chatroom.

303
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:21,541
[SPEAKER_06]: Just look it up on somethingawful.com, go under their movie reviews and look for blood-sucking vampire rednecks.

304
00:27:22,361 --> 00:27:23,963
[SPEAKER_06]: and go to page 4.

305
00:27:25,124 --> 00:27:29,488
[SPEAKER_06]: I love reading SomethingAwful.com's movie reviews because they're hilarious.

306
00:27:29,988 --> 00:27:32,470
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyways, yeah, it's nasty.

307
00:27:34,692 --> 00:27:39,977
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's kind of like last week when I was trying to show all the videos on air.

308
00:27:41,378 --> 00:27:43,801
[SPEAKER_05]: You trying to go in and show people the...

309
00:27:46,043 --> 00:28:00,349
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's like if you were to take some really nasty biker woman at an eye patch and her leg is like the size of an elephant, that would probably be an accurate description.

310
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:04,371
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously, that's... Anyways, I'm done.

311
00:28:05,111 --> 00:28:06,532
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't lie, you know you think she's hot.

312
00:28:06,772 --> 00:28:08,713
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, I want to do her folds.

313
00:28:12,406 --> 00:28:13,948
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of videos that we play.

314
00:28:13,988 --> 00:28:17,712
[SPEAKER_01]: Common behavior years ago can now be sexual harassment.

315
00:28:18,513 --> 00:28:19,974
[SPEAKER_07]: Smells like vagina in here.

316
00:28:20,875 --> 00:28:21,716
[SPEAKER_07]: My vagina?

317
00:28:21,997 --> 00:28:24,299
[SPEAKER_07]: Smells like fresh vagina in here.

318
00:28:25,481 --> 00:28:27,503
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you talking about my vagina?

319
00:28:28,524 --> 00:28:28,964
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe.

320
00:28:29,545 --> 00:28:29,805
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

321
00:28:31,087 --> 00:28:32,088
[SPEAKER_05]: Nellie, how was your week?

322
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:32,789
[SPEAKER_05]: How was your day?

323
00:28:34,989 --> 00:28:49,283
[SPEAKER_07]: It was the same as Matt's, except I watched that video and that was pretty funny, and I showed it to my co-worker, and she told me a funny story about how she had sex with this guy, but not really, where he kind of slipped and he entered in between her butt cheeks.

324
00:28:49,323 --> 00:28:51,685
[SPEAKER_05]: You know we have children that listen to this program.

325
00:28:52,426 --> 00:28:52,846
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep talking.

326
00:28:53,026 --> 00:28:54,428
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what my week was like.

327
00:28:54,488 --> 00:28:56,570
[SPEAKER_07]: It was like talking about funny shit like that.

328
00:28:57,250 --> 00:29:00,113
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was wonderful, and today was great because I got laid.

329
00:29:04,881 --> 00:29:08,303
[SPEAKER_06]: Ironically enough, so did I. No.

330
00:29:09,904 --> 00:29:11,104
[SPEAKER_05]: Bugged just joined us.

331
00:29:11,925 --> 00:29:14,986
[SPEAKER_05]: My old friend Bugged, who's known me longer than most people.

332
00:29:15,707 --> 00:29:18,348
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes, and I feel like I don't know you anymore.

333
00:29:19,169 --> 00:29:19,869
[SPEAKER_05]: Why is that?

334
00:29:20,289 --> 00:29:21,190
[SPEAKER_05]: Because these freaks.

335
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:27,313
[SPEAKER_05]: The chatroom is telling me I'm not actually gay because of the fact that I was able to ID a woman based on her tits.

336
00:29:27,893 --> 00:29:28,714
[SPEAKER_05]: They're saying I'm not gay.

337
00:29:28,734 --> 00:29:33,196
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no, that has nothing to do with... Bugged has known I was gay longer than I have, actually.

338
00:29:33,216 --> 00:29:33,296
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

339
00:29:34,955 --> 00:29:35,355
[SPEAKER_05]: It's true!

340
00:29:37,638 --> 00:29:38,218
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright, anyway.

341
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:39,079
[SPEAKER_23]: How was your week?

342
00:29:39,099 --> 00:29:39,560
[SPEAKER_23]: How was your day?

343
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,981
[SPEAKER_23]: Not as exciting as anyone else's.

344
00:29:41,221 --> 00:29:42,002
[SPEAKER_23]: Did you get laid today?

345
00:29:42,122 --> 00:29:42,262
[SPEAKER_23]: No.

346
00:29:42,502 --> 00:29:42,963
[SPEAKER_23]: That's too bad.

347
00:29:46,626 --> 00:29:48,268
[SPEAKER_23]: We've got to make them blush, not us.

348
00:29:48,729 --> 00:29:51,852
[SPEAKER_07]: What was Rob like when he was just this little whore?

349
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:52,692
What?

350
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:55,321
[SPEAKER_05]: I was never a little whore.

351
00:29:55,341 --> 00:29:56,502
[SPEAKER_05]: You must specify it, Dan.

352
00:29:56,582 --> 00:29:57,483
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a younger whore.

353
00:29:57,523 --> 00:30:03,667
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't lose my virginity until I was like 20 years old, but you have to remember I had all these issues going on at the same time.

354
00:30:04,328 --> 00:30:05,368
[SPEAKER_05]: Andrea issues?

355
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:08,491
[SPEAKER_05]: Talk about my ex-girlfriend on the air.

356
00:30:09,071 --> 00:30:10,452
[SPEAKER_05]: We're famous on the internet.

357
00:30:10,472 --> 00:30:11,913
[SPEAKER_05]: She might listen for God's sake.

358
00:30:12,193 --> 00:30:12,413
[SPEAKER_23]: No.

359
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:14,155
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just looking at Loki's screen.

360
00:30:14,235 --> 00:30:14,635
[SPEAKER_05]: Stop.

361
00:30:14,895 --> 00:30:15,235
[SPEAKER_05]: Stop.

362
00:30:15,616 --> 00:30:15,876
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah.

363
00:30:16,236 --> 00:30:16,656
[SPEAKER_05]: Stop.

364
00:30:18,318 --> 00:30:19,038
[SPEAKER_05]: You're horrible.

365
00:30:20,479 --> 00:30:21,260
[SPEAKER_23]: That's why you keep me around.

366
00:30:24,241 --> 00:30:26,183
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, now I lost my train of thought.

367
00:30:26,284 --> 00:30:26,604
[SPEAKER_05]: Forget it.

368
00:30:27,385 --> 00:30:29,107
[SPEAKER_23]: Now my week wasn't exciting to anyone else.

369
00:30:29,147 --> 00:30:30,048
[SPEAKER_05]: I know what I was going to say.

370
00:30:30,128 --> 00:30:34,253
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're still 20, 21, and you haven't lost your virginity, it might just be because you're gay.

371
00:30:34,854 --> 00:30:36,156
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm kidding.

372
00:30:36,176 --> 00:30:36,496
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kidding.

373
00:30:36,516 --> 00:30:37,317
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm totally kidding you guys.

374
00:30:38,018 --> 00:30:39,279
[SPEAKER_05]: But I had all those issues.

375
00:30:40,901 --> 00:30:41,402
[SPEAKER_05]: Stop it.

376
00:30:42,223 --> 00:30:42,964
[SPEAKER_05]: Was that your problem, Matt?

377
00:30:52,179 --> 00:30:54,819
[SPEAKER_06]: My plate caused the deaths of thousands of people.

378
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:56,960
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a great story.

379
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,940
[SPEAKER_05]: You should tell it on air.

380
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,101
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why it took so long.

381
00:31:01,121 --> 00:31:02,961
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I was like, do I like pussy?

382
00:31:03,021 --> 00:31:03,781
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, no, I don't.

383
00:31:04,061 --> 00:31:06,101
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of like guys.

384
00:31:06,221 --> 00:31:07,442
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody likes pussy.

385
00:31:07,942 --> 00:31:10,942
[SPEAKER_05]: My hands smell like tuna.

386
00:31:11,262 --> 00:31:13,083
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything else you want to say about your week and your day?

387
00:31:14,323 --> 00:31:15,183
[SPEAKER_05]: It's fucking hot.

388
00:31:16,063 --> 00:31:16,323
[SPEAKER_05]: It is.

389
00:31:16,783 --> 00:31:17,963
[SPEAKER_05]: Is the AC on in here?

390
00:31:18,124 --> 00:31:18,504
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

391
00:31:19,524 --> 00:31:19,864
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't know.

392
00:31:19,904 --> 00:31:20,424
[SPEAKER_23]: You live here.

393
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:23,971
[SPEAKER_23]: Your TV's running.

394
00:31:24,892 --> 00:31:25,312
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's true.

395
00:31:25,332 --> 00:31:26,332
[SPEAKER_05]: And nobody's out there watching it?

396
00:31:26,512 --> 00:31:26,693
[SPEAKER_23]: No.

397
00:31:26,813 --> 00:31:27,953
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that was my week and my day.

398
00:31:28,433 --> 00:31:36,356
[SPEAKER_05]: As of like an hour and a half ago, I just purchased a new HDTV, a 30-inch HDTV, because I wanted it.

399
00:31:38,197 --> 00:31:39,037
[SPEAKER_05]: Must be nice.

400
00:31:39,757 --> 00:31:40,478
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, here's the thing.

401
00:31:40,538 --> 00:31:43,019
[SPEAKER_05]: I have some extra money right now because this is a three-paycheck month.

402
00:31:43,379 --> 00:31:46,620
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I was deciding, do I want to get a PowerBook or do I want to get...

403
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:47,981
[SPEAKER_05]: and a new TV.

404
00:31:48,261 --> 00:31:51,923
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was going to get the PowerBook, but then my friend said, oh, it'll take six weeks to get here.

405
00:31:51,983 --> 00:31:56,025
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, fuck that, because I'm going to the East Coast, because I'm going to get the discount, because my friend works for Apple.

406
00:31:56,426 --> 00:31:57,626
[SPEAKER_05]: But it would take six weeks to get there.

407
00:31:57,666 --> 00:32:01,368
[SPEAKER_05]: And I said, well, fuck that, because I'm going to Pennsylvania in two weeks, and that's what I want my laptop for.

408
00:32:01,729 --> 00:32:03,069
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm just going to use my parents' shitty old video.

409
00:32:03,089 --> 00:32:04,990
[SPEAKER_05]: How is this whole nexus with Pennsylvania?

410
00:32:05,931 --> 00:32:06,291
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

411
00:32:06,331 --> 00:32:07,652
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just this void where I get sucked into.

412
00:32:07,672 --> 00:32:08,713
[SPEAKER_23]: My roommates just moved there.

413
00:32:08,813 --> 00:32:10,093
[SPEAKER_23]: My new roommates are from there.

414
00:32:10,854 --> 00:32:12,855
[SPEAKER_23]: You're bouncing through there.

415
00:32:13,849 --> 00:32:43,453

00:33:12,567 --> 00:33:18,070
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody is saying, somebody is shaking their fist at me because they're 28 and still a virgin.

423
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:19,270
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, it's all right.

424
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:19,930
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

425
00:33:20,010 --> 00:33:22,551
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me give you the truth about sex, okay?

426
00:33:23,552 --> 00:33:24,112
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, this should be good.

427
00:33:24,352 --> 00:33:27,513
[SPEAKER_05]: Once you have it, you always want it.

428
00:33:27,934 --> 00:33:28,914
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it a boy or a girl?

429
00:33:29,074 --> 00:33:30,915
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously, don't lose a boy.

430
00:33:31,604 --> 00:33:33,225
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I'll tell you why you're still a virgin.

431
00:33:33,445 --> 00:33:33,746
[SPEAKER_07]: Why?

432
00:33:33,766 --> 00:33:35,267
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you're in that chat room.

433
00:33:35,907 --> 00:33:36,588
[SPEAKER_05]: Stop it!

434
00:33:36,648 --> 00:33:37,909
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a nice guy.

435
00:33:37,989 --> 00:33:38,469
[SPEAKER_05]: Stop it.

436
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:41,952
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry if you're nice.

437
00:33:42,012 --> 00:33:44,534
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, hey, our chat room gets people laid.

438
00:33:47,796 --> 00:33:50,258
[SPEAKER_05]: Look, I'll tell you what, once you have it, you always want it.

439
00:33:50,338 --> 00:33:52,439
[SPEAKER_05]: So stay a virgin until you're 40, honestly.

440
00:33:56,089 --> 00:33:56,669
[SPEAKER_05]: What else is there?

441
00:33:57,850 --> 00:34:00,091
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody wants to know if there's an Apple store here in Sacramento.

442
00:34:00,111 --> 00:34:09,376
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, there is, and I was just there today because my roommate, his extifer, is having a birthday on Tuesday, and his parents got him a gift card for the Apple store, and he went and bought an iPod.

443
00:34:09,737 --> 00:34:17,541
[SPEAKER_05]: But the little bastard, for the same price I bought my iPod for, like, what, in December, he got a color iPod.

444
00:34:18,401 --> 00:34:19,822
[SPEAKER_05]: I got mine for $190, 20 gig.

445
00:34:20,122 --> 00:34:20,763
[SPEAKER_05]: Fucking Apple.

446
00:34:21,903 --> 00:34:23,284
[SPEAKER_05]: Fucking price cuts.

447
00:34:24,209 --> 00:34:25,690
[SPEAKER_05]: He should have paid more than what I pay.

448
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:26,290
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not fair.

449
00:34:27,990 --> 00:34:29,751
[SPEAKER_05]: Which pay?

450
00:34:29,931 --> 00:34:29,751
300?

451
00:34:30,311 --> 00:34:29,751
300.

452
00:34:30,331 --> 00:34:31,192
[SPEAKER_05]: 300.

453
00:34:30,351 --> 00:34:31,192
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what he paid today.

454
00:34:31,212 --> 00:34:31,952
[SPEAKER_05]: And he got a color one.

455
00:34:31,972 --> 00:34:33,232
[SPEAKER_05]: I got a 20 gig black and white.

456
00:34:33,492 --> 00:34:34,533
[SPEAKER_05]: He got a 20 gig color.

457
00:34:34,793 --> 00:34:38,094
[SPEAKER_05]: So he's like, and of course he has to come in here and show me, Look, Rob!

458
00:34:38,574 --> 00:34:40,955
[SPEAKER_03]: I have album art on my iPod!

459
00:34:41,475 --> 00:34:43,156
[SPEAKER_23]: I look at my iPod twice a day.

460
00:34:44,256 --> 00:34:46,177
[SPEAKER_23]: The rest of the time it resides in my armrest.

461
00:34:49,558 --> 00:34:49,799
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway.

462
00:34:50,579 --> 00:34:51,379
[SPEAKER_05]: The rest of my week and my day.

463
00:34:51,699 --> 00:34:53,540
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.

464
00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:55,766
[SPEAKER_05]: Where the hell was the elevator?

465
00:35:22,549 --> 00:35:23,610
[SPEAKER_05]: The Elevator was in the first movie.

466
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:24,290
[SPEAKER_05]: It was in the very end.

467
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:25,811
[SPEAKER_23]: Not as prominently as it was in the book.

468
00:35:25,871 --> 00:35:26,591
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly, exactly.

469
00:35:26,891 --> 00:35:28,932
[SPEAKER_05]: And just the songs were different.

470
00:35:29,052 --> 00:35:31,913
[SPEAKER_05]: And Veruca Salt's whole scene was completely different.

471
00:35:32,193 --> 00:35:35,815
[SPEAKER_05]: But some people like that because she had the whole, I want it now.

472
00:35:36,255 --> 00:35:38,136
[SPEAKER_05]: She had her whole little song and some people loved that.

473
00:35:38,156 --> 00:35:39,577
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's not in the new movie.

474
00:35:39,917 --> 00:35:41,617
[SPEAKER_05]: And that drives some people crazy.

475
00:35:41,898 --> 00:35:44,299
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm telling you, the new movie is awesome.

476
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:45,039
[SPEAKER_05]: I loved it.

477
00:35:45,159 --> 00:35:46,079
[SPEAKER_05]: I highly recommend it.

478
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:49,741
[SPEAKER_05]: The reason why I liked it, one of the reasons why I liked it is because Johnny Depp,

479
00:35:50,307 --> 00:35:51,588
[SPEAKER_05]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

480
00:36:19,264 --> 00:36:23,085
[SPEAKER_14]: See, like, the songs are just, like, nutty in this one.

481
00:36:23,125 --> 00:36:26,106
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, they range from that little, like, weird ballad thing.

482
00:36:26,126 --> 00:36:28,267
[SPEAKER_14]: Before Christmas was, you know...

483
00:36:42,692 --> 00:36:45,394
[SPEAKER_05]: Danny Elfman did all the songs, so it's like Oingo Boingo revisited.

484
00:36:45,454 --> 00:36:47,795
[SPEAKER_05]: He sung it all and did the whole nine yards of that.

485
00:36:48,136 --> 00:36:50,697
[SPEAKER_05]: But then some of the songs are way different.

486
00:36:50,717 --> 00:36:52,598
[SPEAKER_05]: Then Veruca's Salt song is like a ballad.

487
00:36:56,041 --> 00:36:56,961
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, I liked the movie.

488
00:36:56,981 --> 00:36:57,321
[SPEAKER_05]: It was cool.

489
00:36:57,361 --> 00:36:58,362
[SPEAKER_23]: I stopped the lighter for that one.

490
00:36:59,723 --> 00:37:00,183
[SPEAKER_05]: Go see it.

491
00:37:00,243 --> 00:37:00,964
[SPEAKER_05]: I highly recommend it.

492
00:37:01,004 --> 00:37:01,404
[SPEAKER_05]: It was good.

493
00:37:01,904 --> 00:37:05,807
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't go in expecting Gene Wilder or Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory because that's not what you're going to get.

494
00:37:06,067 --> 00:37:08,729
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you read the books as a kid, you're going to be very pleased.

495
00:37:08,829 --> 00:37:10,009
[SPEAKER_23]: What about Johnny Depp as a pirate?

496
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:13,649
[SPEAKER_05]: But Johnny Depp doesn't play a pirate in this.

497
00:37:13,709 --> 00:37:17,973
[SPEAKER_05]: I heard his inspiration for this movie was Marilyn Manson, which kind of makes sense.

498
00:37:18,473 --> 00:37:19,294
[SPEAKER_05]: No, he said no.

499
00:37:19,534 --> 00:37:21,596
[SPEAKER_06]: He said it was the original movie.

500
00:37:22,116 --> 00:37:24,278
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it can't be because he's nothing like Charlie.

501
00:37:24,298 --> 00:37:25,178
[SPEAKER_06]: It was Michael Jackson.

502
00:37:25,218 --> 00:37:26,499
[SPEAKER_06]: We know it's Michael Jackson.

503
00:37:26,539 --> 00:37:27,620
[SPEAKER_06]: He's just not admitting to it.

504
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:28,261
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it can't be.

505
00:37:29,096 --> 00:37:31,817
[SPEAKER_05]: It can't be Michael Jackson because, hey, DarkSakura's here.

506
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:37,298
[SPEAKER_05]: His inspiration can't be Michael Jackson because Michael Jackson loves kids almost a little too much.

507
00:37:37,878 --> 00:37:42,560
[SPEAKER_05]: And in this movie, Johnny Depp hated children, and that's what made it so amazingly wonderful.

508
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:44,460
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I liked it.

509
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:45,961
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, DarkSakura, you're here.

510
00:37:47,381 --> 00:37:53,563
[SPEAKER_05]: In classic Orange Lounge fashion, you're tardy to a landmark episode number.

511
00:37:54,023 --> 00:37:54,423
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kidding.

512
00:37:54,903 --> 00:37:55,243
[SPEAKER_10]: Huh?

513
00:37:55,543 --> 00:37:56,143
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just kidding.

514
00:37:56,784 --> 00:37:58,224
[SPEAKER_10]: I was doing Grandma Doody.

515
00:37:58,701 --> 00:37:58,961
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

516
00:37:59,181 --> 00:37:59,982
[SPEAKER_05]: Whose birthday was it?

517
00:38:00,002 --> 00:38:00,622
[SPEAKER_05]: I couldn't remember.

518
00:38:00,702 --> 00:38:02,683
[SPEAKER_10]: Dan's grandmother's 70th birthday.

519
00:38:02,703 --> 00:38:03,623
[SPEAKER_05]: Dan's grandma's 70th birthday.

520
00:38:03,643 --> 00:38:05,003
[SPEAKER_10]: So I was in Granite Bay.

521
00:38:05,924 --> 00:38:07,624
[SPEAKER_10]: In like John L. Sullivan's neighborhood.

522
00:38:07,764 --> 00:38:11,046
[SPEAKER_05]: Granite Bay is like the Mormon central of Northern California.

523
00:38:11,086 --> 00:38:12,406
[SPEAKER_10]: It's also where rich people go.

524
00:38:12,806 --> 00:38:13,907
[SPEAKER_10]: And they form colonies.

525
00:38:14,247 --> 00:38:14,887
[SPEAKER_23]: There's no difference.

526
00:38:16,708 --> 00:38:18,128
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay.

527
00:38:18,248 --> 00:38:21,330
[SPEAKER_23]: We went to a school that had half of Granite Bay in it.

528
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:27,772
[SPEAKER_23]: So the parking lot was like Bugs, old Mustangs, and then Mercedes and BMWs.

529
00:38:28,351 --> 00:38:30,653
[SPEAKER_10]: I felt very ill the whole time I was there.

530
00:38:31,354 --> 00:38:32,234
[SPEAKER_10]: It was not too funny.

531
00:38:32,294 --> 00:38:33,235
[SPEAKER_23]: You didn't go to Wendy's, did you?

532
00:38:33,375 --> 00:38:34,016
[SPEAKER_23]: My brother works there.

533
00:38:35,077 --> 00:38:39,100
[SPEAKER_10]: No, we had like, like, gourmet chicken.

534
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:39,440
[SPEAKER_10]: Ooh.

535
00:38:40,301 --> 00:38:42,523
[SPEAKER_10]: And, hey, it landed the right way.

536
00:38:44,464 --> 00:38:48,728
[SPEAKER_10]: And ribs and all kinds of rich people food.

537
00:38:50,609 --> 00:38:51,630
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you have hors d'oeuvres?

538
00:38:52,431 --> 00:38:52,591
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

539
00:38:52,691 --> 00:38:54,132
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you have... I had cheese.

540
00:38:54,192 --> 00:38:56,394
[SPEAKER_05]: What's rich, white, snobby people food?

541
00:38:56,434 --> 00:38:56,835
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you have...

542
00:38:58,294 --> 00:39:06,222
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, you're here just in time.

543
00:39:06,262 --> 00:39:06,703
[SPEAKER_05]: How was your week?

544
00:39:06,723 --> 00:39:07,864
[SPEAKER_05]: How was your day, my friend?

545
00:39:11,708 --> 00:39:12,790
[SPEAKER_10]: I played some PSO.

546
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:14,051
[SPEAKER_10]: That was it.

547
00:39:15,833 --> 00:39:16,654
[SPEAKER_10]: Seriously, that was it.

548
00:39:18,408 --> 00:39:23,190
[SPEAKER_10]: I got really bored, my computer decided to die, I put those stupid Windows updates on it, and I'm so ready to get a Mac.

549
00:39:24,351 --> 00:39:26,632
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm getting tired of all this Microsoft bullshit.

550
00:39:26,652 --> 00:39:28,172
[SPEAKER_21]: Come to the light side.

551
00:39:28,773 --> 00:39:29,213
[SPEAKER_21]: No!

552
00:39:30,373 --> 00:39:41,178
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what, you need to get off of your little I hate Mac piece of shit, because you know what, they're really good computers if... You don't know jack about computers, that's what they're good for, is if you don't want to do anything.

553
00:39:41,698 --> 00:39:44,559
[SPEAKER_10]: No, they're more for the people who are specialists in their fields.

554
00:39:44,639 --> 00:39:45,780
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, they rock at gaming too.

555
00:39:46,325 --> 00:39:52,249
[SPEAKER_10]: You can also put a bunch of Macs together and get a lot more processing power out of them.

556
00:39:52,849 --> 00:39:53,970
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm warming up to Macs.

557
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:55,591
[SPEAKER_05]: I want one.

558
00:39:56,111 --> 00:39:58,473
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm not going to play games on it.

559
00:39:58,573 --> 00:39:59,613
[SPEAKER_05]: I want it for audio.

560
00:39:59,693 --> 00:40:03,296
[SPEAKER_10]: If I want to play games, I get myself a G5 and put Virtual PC on it.

561
00:40:03,336 --> 00:40:04,997
[SPEAKER_10]: I can play any game I want to and a story.

562
00:40:05,417 --> 00:40:07,258
[SPEAKER_10]: And on top of that, I have a system that's good for graphics.

563
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:11,461
[SPEAKER_10]: This needs to move.

564
00:40:12,041 --> 00:40:12,461
[SPEAKER_05]: What is this?

565
00:40:12,942 --> 00:40:13,402
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, sorry.

566
00:40:14,423 --> 00:40:14,883
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

567
00:40:18,722 --> 00:40:25,906
[SPEAKER_10]: I do admit that there's a lot of really stupid Mac users out there who are ultimately clueless because it actually can do a bunch of stuff for you.

568
00:40:26,366 --> 00:40:27,686
[SPEAKER_10]: And then there's, like, the smart people.

569
00:40:29,407 --> 00:40:33,229
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think, like, the middle-of-the-line people, the mediocre people are all PC.

570
00:40:33,949 --> 00:40:37,111
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you still thinking of Macintoshes as what we used in high school, though?

571
00:40:37,151 --> 00:40:38,131
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe that's the problem.

572
00:40:38,511 --> 00:40:38,872
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

573
00:40:39,272 --> 00:40:39,732
[SPEAKER_05]: No, not you.

574
00:40:39,972 --> 00:40:40,732
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean Loki.

575
00:40:41,673 --> 00:40:41,813
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

576
00:40:42,013 --> 00:40:44,174
[SPEAKER_10]: That's because he's inflexible and won't learn to adjust.

577
00:40:45,447 --> 00:40:47,109
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I understand flexible.

578
00:40:47,189 --> 00:40:47,589
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

579
00:41:06,215 --> 00:41:07,516
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we're going to go to a break.

580
00:41:07,876 --> 00:41:10,839
[SPEAKER_06]: Next thing you'll say is, you know, in the groove, it's just as good as DDR.

581
00:41:11,099 --> 00:41:12,800
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I want to talk about... No, no, no, no, no.

582
00:41:13,421 --> 00:41:15,382
[SPEAKER_10]: I go for innovation, not stupidity.

583
00:41:16,243 --> 00:41:18,525
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to talk about the lawsuit, just for a little bit.

584
00:41:18,545 --> 00:41:23,349
[SPEAKER_05]: The chatroom got mad at us because we talked about it too much last week, but I want to say there's a little bit, there's a little bit of news going on, so I want to talk about that.

585
00:41:23,709 --> 00:41:25,911
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, the chatroom got upset.

586
00:41:26,071 --> 00:41:26,591
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, no.

587
00:41:27,532 --> 00:41:29,694
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, the chatroom also needs to learn how to be flexible, too.

588
00:41:31,215 --> 00:41:32,395
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, we'll be back after this.

589
00:41:32,895 --> 00:41:39,257
[SPEAKER_05]: In this break, I want to play a new song from the new Katamari Damacy game, because I got some rips from it, so we're going to play this one.

590
00:41:39,817 --> 00:41:42,758
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't even listened to any of them yet, but this one's called Katamari Holiday.

591
00:41:42,798 --> 00:41:43,438
[SPEAKER_05]: How bad could it be?

592
00:41:44,618 --> 00:41:45,638
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a holiday song.

593
00:41:45,658 --> 00:41:48,099
[SPEAKER_05]: They need Katamari Damacy the movie.

594
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:52,100
[SPEAKER_10]: Katamari Damacy did have the track You Are Smart, the one that gave me splitting headaches.

595
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,380
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we'll see how this one is.

596
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:55,941
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.

597
00:41:58,996 --> 00:42:00,417
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for watching!

598
00:42:27,666 --> 00:42:32,710
[SPEAKER_14]: I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you

599
00:42:53,012 --> 00:42:55,916
[SPEAKER_14]: Subtitles by the Amara.org community

600
00:43:06,868 --> 00:43:08,648
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for watching!

601
00:43:39,986 --> 00:43:41,172
Thanks for watching!

602
00:43:48,647 --> 00:43:59,113
[SPEAKER_14]: Yattara Setsugai Asa Kumori Manobi Singo Yu Kimi no Sugata Katadoru Natsukashii Ashioto ga Taiyoku Suru Yo Masanshain Warawou

603
00:44:14,136 --> 00:44:19,878
[SPEAKER_14]: Sometimes it sways, a lump of water, the scent of the flowing wind, the hand-pulling train.

604
00:44:19,938 --> 00:44:29,182
[SPEAKER_14]: For dream of you, the ripples of the dream, the feeling of the wind, are various colors.

605
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:43,522
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for watching.

606
00:44:43,562 --> 00:44:46,364
[SPEAKER_14]: Please subscribe to my channel.

607
00:45:14,885 --> 00:45:16,506
I met you a long time ago

608
00:45:44,073 --> 00:45:46,015
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for watching!

609
00:46:08,354 --> 00:46:09,495
Thank you for watching!

610
00:46:35,096 --> 00:46:43,900
[SPEAKER_14]: It's been a long, long, long time since I've been with you.

611
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:46,882
[SPEAKER_14]: It's been a long, long, long time since I've been with you.

612
00:47:01,883 --> 00:47:02,744
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for watching!

613
00:47:37,561 --> 00:47:42,905
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Radio, Mamani Music, and more.

614
00:47:43,105 --> 00:47:45,787
[SPEAKER_05]: Howdy boys and girls, we're back with more Orange Lounge Radio.

615
00:47:45,827 --> 00:47:48,309
[SPEAKER_05]: Hope you enjoyed that rather long song from Katamari Damacy.

616
00:47:48,349 --> 00:47:54,233
[SPEAKER_05]: But dammit, we just wanted to see if the music in the second game would be just as good as the first game.

617
00:47:54,433 --> 00:47:55,854
[SPEAKER_03]: It was okay.

618
00:47:55,954 --> 00:47:58,136
[SPEAKER_05]: I probably didn't play the best song.

619
00:47:58,176 --> 00:48:01,358
[SPEAKER_05]: I just picked a good sounding one because I honestly haven't had time to listen to the whole soundtrack.

620
00:48:01,398 --> 00:48:02,759
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just picked one with a good name.

621
00:48:03,179 --> 00:48:04,300
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe I didn't pick the right one.

622
00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:05,999
[SPEAKER_05]: We are back.

623
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:10,301
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll talk a little more about the DDR and some of the other games we've been playing.

624
00:48:11,541 --> 00:48:12,022
[SPEAKER_05]: What the hell?

625
00:48:12,082 --> 00:48:13,882
[SPEAKER_05]: The chat room over at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

626
00:48:13,902 --> 00:48:14,402
[SPEAKER_05]: Click on chat.

627
00:48:14,422 --> 00:48:16,763
[SPEAKER_05]: They're saying I sound like Cookie from You Don't Know Jack.

628
00:48:17,123 --> 00:48:19,464
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is not the first time this subject has been brought up.

629
00:48:19,984 --> 00:48:21,285
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what they're talking about.

630
00:48:21,605 --> 00:48:28,748
[SPEAKER_05]: I've played You Don't Know Jack, like the first one, but I... Then there's like You Don't Know Jack, like every type of edition under the sun.

631
00:48:28,768 --> 00:48:30,849
[SPEAKER_05]: There was like, you know, You Don't Know Jack.

632
00:48:33,049 --> 00:48:33,670
[SPEAKER_05]: Monkey edition.

633
00:48:33,730 --> 00:48:34,010
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

634
00:48:34,070 --> 00:48:34,730
[SPEAKER_05]: It's crazy stuff.

635
00:48:35,635 --> 00:48:35,715
[SPEAKER_05]: D.D.R.

636
00:48:35,755 --> 00:48:35,915
[SPEAKER_05]: World

637
00:48:52,166 --> 00:48:59,432
[SPEAKER_05]: DDR Freak likes to play the smoking gun in these types of situations and they dig up the legal documents and post them on the website for everybody to see.

638
00:48:59,492 --> 00:49:06,117
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can head on over to ddrfreak.com and you too can check out the amended complaint against Red Octane and Mad Catz.

639
00:49:06,498 --> 00:49:08,699
[SPEAKER_05]: So everybody can try to be a lawyer.

640
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:09,420
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay!

641
00:49:10,601 --> 00:49:14,804
[SPEAKER_05]: Which just makes the forums light up with blah blah blah blah blah blah.

642
00:49:14,844 --> 00:49:15,585
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I'm a lawyer.

643
00:49:16,421 --> 00:49:22,967
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that this, this, this, and I know this, this, this, and the real fact of the matter is nobody knows shit unless you've been to law school.

644
00:49:23,568 --> 00:49:25,570
[SPEAKER_05]: So, it's just interesting.

645
00:49:25,610 --> 00:49:28,212
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody's kind of got their own opinion on this whole thing going on.

646
00:49:28,713 --> 00:49:33,557
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought, however, there was a really excellent article that was done by our buddy El Mullet.

647
00:49:34,147 --> 00:49:34,888
[SPEAKER_05]: InsidePulse.com

648
00:49:59,645 --> 00:50:01,886
[SPEAKER_05]: This is how they're in violation of the law, end of story.

649
00:50:02,286 --> 00:50:05,747
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it doesn't matter how much you go, oh, blah, blah, blah, you're wrong.

650
00:50:06,668 --> 00:50:10,329
[SPEAKER_05]: Because if it were a good game, it wouldn't matter.

651
00:50:10,349 --> 00:50:19,333
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, this is what ticks people off, and this was in the original lawsuit documents, and of course it showed up in these original documents too, is that Konami in their lawsuit says, In the Groove is an inferior game.

652
00:50:20,033 --> 00:50:21,614
[SPEAKER_05]: And people go, ahhh!

653
00:50:22,434 --> 00:50:24,635
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, all the In the Groove fanboys, it goes, ahhh!

654
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:30,052
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's got the minds, and it's got the increased steps, and it's got better music.

655
00:50:30,072 --> 00:50:33,472
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, despite, you know, I don't really want to have that argument again.

656
00:50:33,973 --> 00:50:38,073
[SPEAKER_05]: Either you like In The Groove more than you like DDR Extreme or any of the previous mixes, or you don't.

657
00:50:38,213 --> 00:50:39,374
[SPEAKER_05]: You're one way or the other.

658
00:50:39,394 --> 00:50:40,294
[SPEAKER_05]: You think they're okay.

659
00:50:40,334 --> 00:50:40,654
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

660
00:50:41,154 --> 00:50:53,997
[SPEAKER_06]: What I did find was interesting about it was the whole, they were showing their patents and stuff, and they were showing pictures of their concept for DDR and stuff, and the arrows were supposed to be scrolling downwards as the original concept.

661
00:50:54,017 --> 00:50:56,197
[SPEAKER_06]: Those were actually, those documents were in the first

662
00:50:56,693 --> 00:50:57,334
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

663
00:51:16,826 --> 00:51:18,908
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, A, in their minds it is.

664
00:51:19,068 --> 00:51:20,509
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's a fact of the matter.

665
00:51:20,909 --> 00:51:25,732
[SPEAKER_05]: B, just the fact that I think a lot of it has to do with the setup of the game being inferior.

666
00:51:25,752 --> 00:51:30,516
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is why I talked about when the first lawsuit came up is that the hardware itself is the inferior part.

667
00:51:30,836 --> 00:51:34,559
[SPEAKER_05]: Because in the beginning, and I'm not talking about in the group too, and neither is the lawsuit.

668
00:51:34,659 --> 00:51:37,120
[SPEAKER_05]: In the beginning, in the group did not have its own cabinet.

669
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:40,683
[SPEAKER_05]: It was built to be a stowaway game in other cabinets.

670
00:51:40,723 --> 00:51:42,624
[SPEAKER_05]: Therefore, the hardware is inferior.

671
00:51:43,245 --> 00:51:45,926
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, now this lawsuit addresses the home versions, etc., etc.,

672
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:48,761
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so I don't know.

673
00:51:50,162 --> 00:51:54,164
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess they call it inferior because of the fact that it's basically... Inferior?

674
00:51:55,625 --> 00:51:57,126
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a mock-up of DDR.

675
00:51:58,087 --> 00:52:01,389
[SPEAKER_05]: It kind of started, if you think about it, Stepmania, it's built off of Stepmania.

676
00:52:01,409 --> 00:52:02,609
[SPEAKER_10]: You mean a mockery of DDR?

677
00:52:03,230 --> 00:52:07,732
[SPEAKER_05]: If you think about it, Stepmania was built to simulate DDR, right?

678
00:52:08,133 --> 00:52:11,915
[SPEAKER_05]: So a simulator is always going to be inferior to the original, right?

679
00:52:12,495 --> 00:52:12,795
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

680
00:52:12,855 --> 00:52:14,016
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess that's one way you can look at it.

681
00:52:14,835 --> 00:52:15,915
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to get too far into this.

682
00:52:16,176 --> 00:52:21,417
[SPEAKER_06]: I like how the step charts are already online for In the Groove because they were easily ripped from the game.

683
00:52:22,078 --> 00:52:22,658
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, guess what?

684
00:52:22,718 --> 00:52:23,558
[SPEAKER_06]: It's In the Groove.

685
00:52:23,638 --> 00:52:25,839
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, that was difficult.

686
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:29,040
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, I know.

687
00:52:29,841 --> 00:52:33,382
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you like them apples, In the Groove, Roxor?

688
00:52:34,302 --> 00:52:35,063
[SPEAKER_05]: But you know what?

689
00:52:35,383 --> 00:52:43,086
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it hurts them at all because the same people that are into the step mania scene, I think, are a large part of the In the Groove fan base.

690
00:52:43,146 --> 00:52:44,066
[SPEAKER_05]: You're self-accepted.

691
00:52:46,172 --> 00:52:47,172
[SPEAKER_05]: That was before retards.

692
00:52:50,313 --> 00:52:52,274
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't understand why you won't even give the game a chance.

693
00:52:52,474 --> 00:52:53,815
[SPEAKER_06]: You just- That fucking sucks!

694
00:52:53,835 --> 00:52:57,276
[SPEAKER_06]: You've been anti-integrity- I can crap out better themes than that.

695
00:52:57,416 --> 00:52:59,416
[SPEAKER_06]: And honestly, I suck at making themes.

696
00:52:59,556 --> 00:53:01,997
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, those are the plainest looking things I've ever seen.

697
00:53:02,517 --> 00:53:04,658
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks like something you would see in beta.

698
00:53:05,078 --> 00:53:05,318
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay?

699
00:53:05,378 --> 00:53:06,419
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like a beta game.

700
00:53:08,119 --> 00:53:09,780
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, he really wouldn't touch it if it was on a Mac.

701
00:53:11,597 --> 00:53:13,478
[SPEAKER_06]: I really wouldn't touch it if it was on a Mac.

702
00:53:13,758 --> 00:53:14,659
[SPEAKER_06]: That'd be just crap.

703
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:16,340
[SPEAKER_06]: It kind of reminds me of the Mac.

704
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:18,901
[SPEAKER_06]: It's nice and smoothed out and plain colors.

705
00:53:20,282 --> 00:53:20,902
[SPEAKER_06]: And pointless.

706
00:53:21,962 --> 00:53:23,483
[SPEAKER_06]: Because there's games out there that are better.

707
00:53:24,444 --> 00:53:26,165
[SPEAKER_06]: Just because it tries to look pretty.

708
00:53:30,807 --> 00:53:31,767
[SPEAKER_06]: But iTunes is cool.

709
00:53:32,308 --> 00:53:33,008
[SPEAKER_06]: Go iTunes.

710
00:53:36,570 --> 00:53:38,671
[SPEAKER_06]: Just, you know, run iTunes on your PC.

711
00:53:40,092 --> 00:53:40,692
[SPEAKER_06]: Intel PC.

712
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:47,564
[SPEAKER_06]: or actually better than Intel PC, your AMD PC, and you're good to go.

713
00:53:50,186 --> 00:53:54,969
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, if you have a Mac, you might as well just get one of those Cyrix chips and throw it in your PC.

714
00:53:55,910 --> 00:53:57,611
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's step back a generation, shall we?

715
00:53:58,211 --> 00:54:01,373
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got some folks in the chat room that are going, let me at them, let me at them.

716
00:54:01,614 --> 00:54:05,957
[SPEAKER_05]: We will open up the Skype line in a little bit if you want to give your comments and feedback.

717
00:54:06,517 --> 00:54:09,479
[SPEAKER_05]: And those cards and letters, love letters addressed to Loki.

718
00:54:10,246 --> 00:54:12,787
[SPEAKER_05]: www.orangeloungeradio.com

719
00:54:35,217 --> 00:54:38,099
[SPEAKER_06]: I have the same problem with Apple that I also have with VW.

720
00:54:38,279 --> 00:54:39,839
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's make cute cars that suck.

721
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:42,721
[SPEAKER_06]: Because people like cute, so they'll buy cute.

722
00:54:42,741 --> 00:54:44,061
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you driven one?

723
00:54:44,201 --> 00:54:47,283
[SPEAKER_06]: VW has the worst ratings as far as reliability.

724
00:54:48,103 --> 00:54:48,944
[SPEAKER_06]: I've driven in one.

725
00:54:49,804 --> 00:54:50,585
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not driving one.

726
00:54:50,605 --> 00:54:51,245
[SPEAKER_10]: Have you driven one?

727
00:54:51,465 --> 00:54:51,565
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

728
00:54:52,165 --> 00:54:53,206
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, then you don't have room to talk.

729
00:54:55,767 --> 00:54:57,328
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to drive your crappy car, no.

730
00:55:02,272 --> 00:55:03,513
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry, you do drive a Ford.

731
00:55:04,433 --> 00:55:05,654
[SPEAKER_10]: Six thousand repair daily.

732
00:55:07,375 --> 00:55:08,636
[SPEAKER_06]: No, my Ford is fine.

733
00:55:08,676 --> 00:55:10,177
[SPEAKER_06]: I've never had any problems with my Ford.

734
00:55:10,457 --> 00:55:11,737
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, wait three years.

735
00:55:12,718 --> 00:55:13,278
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait three years.

736
00:55:13,298 --> 00:55:16,480
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a former, I hate to say it, Loki, I'm a former Ford owner.

737
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:16,940
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait.

738
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:17,581
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait.

739
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:18,741
[SPEAKER_10]: Fine.

740
00:55:19,061 --> 00:55:23,063
[SPEAKER_10]: The only Fords that last any time are the old ones, like my fiance's Mustang.

741
00:55:24,424 --> 00:55:25,585
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah, that's a sexy car.

742
00:55:27,037 --> 00:55:28,939
[SPEAKER_05]: I will never buy another Ford.

743
00:55:29,099 --> 00:55:29,860
[SPEAKER_05]: 1969 Mustang.

744
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,121
[SPEAKER_05]: I will never touch a Mac.

745
00:55:31,361 --> 00:55:32,822
[SPEAKER_05]: All my cars from now on will be foreign.

746
00:55:32,882 --> 00:55:33,443
[SPEAKER_10]: And you know what?

747
00:55:33,483 --> 00:55:36,445
[SPEAKER_10]: My Lancer completely kicks all your cars' asses combined.

748
00:55:36,565 --> 00:55:37,326
[SPEAKER_05]: There will be some.

749
00:55:37,546 --> 00:55:37,826
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

750
00:55:37,866 --> 00:55:38,907
[SPEAKER_05]: You're a remixer.

751
00:55:38,967 --> 00:55:39,908
[SPEAKER_05]: You remix songs.

752
00:55:39,948 --> 00:55:45,593
[SPEAKER_05]: You have never been enticed by some of the Apple products like GarageBand or any of this stuff.

753
00:55:45,973 --> 00:55:46,153
[SPEAKER_05]: Ever.

754
00:55:46,674 --> 00:55:48,696
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I can get the same thing on a PC.

755
00:55:49,056 --> 00:55:49,376
[SPEAKER_06]: You know?

756
00:55:49,496 --> 00:55:49,877
[SPEAKER_06]: So what?

757
00:55:49,977 --> 00:55:51,578
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh, it's got GarageBand.

758
00:55:51,618 --> 00:55:51,718
[SPEAKER_06]: Woo!

759
00:55:53,275 --> 00:55:54,675
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a PC equivalent for that.

760
00:55:55,056 --> 00:55:58,676
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly, if you have a decent sound card, it's going to sound just the same.

761
00:55:58,836 --> 00:56:03,277
[SPEAKER_06]: The Mac does not have anything that a decent sound card can't be better than.

762
00:56:03,958 --> 00:56:05,778
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I don't really care.

763
00:56:08,059 --> 00:56:13,580
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly, the thing that I hated about the original Macs and stuff was the fact that everything was hardwired.

764
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:16,020
[SPEAKER_06]: And I still hate those stupid iMacs.

765
00:56:16,060 --> 00:56:17,141
[SPEAKER_06]: Those things are dumb.

766
00:56:17,741 --> 00:56:22,462
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, you can take the new G5s and put new hard drives in them and upgrade the RAM and everything.

767
00:56:23,117 --> 00:56:24,698
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's about time that they got with the game.

768
00:56:26,338 --> 00:56:29,040
[SPEAKER_10]: Just they don't tell you you can do this, but you can.

769
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:30,761
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, kids.

770
00:56:31,121 --> 00:56:32,401
[SPEAKER_06]: Skype line is open.

771
00:56:32,601 --> 00:56:33,642
[SPEAKER_06]: Give us a call.

772
00:56:33,662 --> 00:56:36,383
[SPEAKER_06]: It's about time to get those Intel processors in there as well.

773
00:56:37,884 --> 00:56:39,525
[SPEAKER_05]: www.orangelunchradio.com.

774
00:56:39,545 --> 00:56:40,085
[SPEAKER_05]: Click on Skype.

775
00:56:40,105 --> 00:56:43,146
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to talk about the lawsuit, you want to yell at Loki.

776
00:56:43,406 --> 00:56:46,848
[SPEAKER_05]: Although, please, kids, we can go back and forth on this all day long.

777
00:56:47,810 --> 00:56:51,832
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the classic interweb debate, is Mac versus PC.

778
00:56:51,912 --> 00:56:53,993
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought this debate ended like five years ago.

779
00:56:54,433 --> 00:56:56,074
[SPEAKER_05]: Leave it to Loki to bring it back up.

780
00:56:56,594 --> 00:56:58,035
[SPEAKER_06]: Why do we get to the FUs of the week?

781
00:56:58,055 --> 00:57:01,317
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I've got a whole other thing that I'm going to re-bring up again.

782
00:57:02,277 --> 00:57:02,857
[SPEAKER_05]: Goody, goody.

783
00:57:04,198 --> 00:57:04,558
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

784
00:57:05,619 --> 00:57:06,799
[SPEAKER_05]: So the Skype line's open.

785
00:57:06,839 --> 00:57:09,601
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to call in, www.orangeloungeradio.com.

786
00:57:09,641 --> 00:57:10,901
[SPEAKER_05]: Click on Interact With Us.

787
00:57:11,622 --> 00:57:12,302
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, and look at that.

788
00:57:12,342 --> 00:57:13,683
[SPEAKER_05]: We're starting to get some phone calls.

789
00:57:13,743 --> 00:57:15,744
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this one's really been wanting to get through.

790
00:57:16,272 --> 00:57:17,893
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

791
00:57:18,713 --> 00:57:20,213
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I figured I'd come back.

792
00:57:20,313 --> 00:57:23,815
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got to jump in on this Mac versus PC debate here.

793
00:57:23,915 --> 00:57:24,735
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you guys hear us in studio?

794
00:57:24,755 --> 00:57:26,156
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got firsthand experience on this.

795
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:27,176
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, what's up?

796
00:57:27,236 --> 00:57:28,236
[SPEAKER_02]: I work on these things.

797
00:57:28,396 --> 00:57:29,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Introduce yourself, please.

798
00:57:29,637 --> 00:57:30,517
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, introduce yourself, sir.

799
00:57:31,737 --> 00:57:32,458
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Reznor.

800
00:57:32,598 --> 00:57:32,958
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, Reznor.

801
00:57:32,998 --> 00:57:34,759
[SPEAKER_02]: I've called in a couple of times.

802
00:57:35,219 --> 00:57:37,419
[SPEAKER_05]: You're the one that does the con on the East Coast, right?

803
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:38,840
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

804
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,020
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I remember this guy.

805
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:40,421
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

806
00:57:40,801 --> 00:57:41,561
[SPEAKER_05]: So what's on your mind?

807
00:57:42,392 --> 00:57:45,954
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I work on PCs and Mac day in and day out.

808
00:57:46,514 --> 00:57:48,995
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to really hate Macs.

809
00:57:50,316 --> 00:57:57,939
[SPEAKER_02]: And after working on them for about three months, Macs can kick PCs' asses all up and down the block.

810
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:10,085
[SPEAKER_02]: If I have to just fix another PC user that brought it in because their stupid kid downloaded Kazaa and got Spyware all over it after I just cleaned it up, I'm going to scream.

811
00:58:11,076 --> 00:58:16,141
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll give you that because people assume that nobody uses Macs.

812
00:58:16,541 --> 00:58:19,084
[SPEAKER_05]: They haven't been as much of a target for the spyware and everything.

813
00:58:19,784 --> 00:58:32,877
[SPEAKER_02]: We've had so many PC people just come in and ditch... One guy traded in three PCs and bought two iMacs and a PowerBook on the spot because he was so sick and tired of his machine crashing and all sorts of crap.

814
00:58:34,279 --> 00:58:34,499
[SPEAKER_06]: Well...

815
00:58:35,168 --> 00:58:39,331
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep, those stupid users need a stupid computer, so it fits right in!

816
00:58:39,591 --> 00:58:41,813
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause, you know, goddamn retard's true!

817
00:58:42,774 --> 00:58:43,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly!

818
00:58:43,134 --> 00:58:50,099
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually own both, um, so, uh, there's things, obviously the PC does gaming a lot better,

819
00:58:50,615 --> 00:58:51,476
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

820
00:59:12,242 --> 00:59:14,204
[SPEAKER_06]: You like their power tools.

821
00:59:14,284 --> 00:59:18,387
[SPEAKER_06]: They granny you to death, and Microsoft does the same thing, and I hate both.

822
00:59:18,407 --> 00:59:19,148
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what it is?

823
00:59:19,388 --> 00:59:21,530
[SPEAKER_05]: You like to build your own PCs, don't you?

824
00:59:21,810 --> 00:59:22,590
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn straight.

825
00:59:22,891 --> 00:59:26,133
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why you don't like Macs, because Macs don't allow you that flexibility.

826
00:59:26,173 --> 00:59:26,814
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn straight.

827
00:59:26,894 --> 00:59:28,235
[SPEAKER_05]: You like being able to buy a part here.

828
00:59:28,255 --> 00:59:29,636
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to differ with them on this one.

829
00:59:29,916 --> 00:59:35,861
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got about six PCs laying around that I just built from just parts laying around.

830
00:59:35,941 --> 00:59:37,743
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll build them day in, day out.

831
00:59:38,243 --> 00:59:38,663
[SPEAKER_02]: and many more.

832
01:00:03,153 --> 01:00:04,415
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't stand Dells either.

833
01:00:04,775 --> 01:00:06,417
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't agree with you on that one.

834
01:00:06,457 --> 01:00:08,699
[SPEAKER_02]: Buying an Apple is not like buying a Dell.

835
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:17,609
[SPEAKER_10]: No, because the difference between a Dell and an Apple is Dell is sort of a put-together piece of crap, except for my laptop, which is pretty nice.

836
01:00:18,369 --> 01:00:20,190
[SPEAKER_10]: and Apple's actually work.

837
01:00:20,530 --> 01:00:26,473
[SPEAKER_02]: Dell is kind of like if you took a giant pile of shit and then you put a nice little case around it and you painted it black.

838
01:00:26,593 --> 01:00:30,795
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas with an Apple, you actually put something useful in it and made it really small.

839
01:00:30,936 --> 01:00:37,499
[SPEAKER_10]: But to one thing say in defense of Dell's, which I really do need to say, their PCs are crap, but the laptops are pretty nice.

840
01:00:38,079 --> 01:00:47,228
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not talking about the quality of service or anything like that because we all know Dell outsources their customer service and Apple's got a pretty decent customer service setup.

841
01:00:47,509 --> 01:00:54,796
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not talking about that whole actual act of going in and purchasing, but I'm talking about that all-in-one feeling where you're buying a computer in a box.

842
01:00:55,636 --> 01:00:58,679
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's face it, the Mac Mini is totally a computer in a box.

843
01:00:59,060 --> 01:01:02,143
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, you can mod those things, but the average user isn't going to be doing that.

844
01:01:02,563 --> 01:01:02,783
[SPEAKER_05]: Right?

845
01:01:02,803 --> 01:01:03,444
[SPEAKER_23]: Exactly.

846
01:01:03,524 --> 01:01:09,311
[SPEAKER_23]: Whereas to build a PC, you really have to think about, okay... The average user really has no need to modify a mini.

847
01:01:09,391 --> 01:01:10,452
[SPEAKER_23]: That's why they buy a mini.

848
01:01:10,512 --> 01:01:11,353
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, I understand that.

849
01:01:11,373 --> 01:01:12,314
[SPEAKER_23]: You plug it in and it works.

850
01:01:12,334 --> 01:01:15,778
[SPEAKER_23]: Except for freaks like us who buy the mini and then mod the hell out of it.

851
01:01:15,818 --> 01:01:17,360
[SPEAKER_23]: But I can... You're not a normal user.

852
01:01:18,131 --> 01:01:20,472
[SPEAKER_23]: I have an iBook and I run Terminal Live.

853
01:01:20,512 --> 01:01:24,293
[SPEAKER_05]: You run Linux.

854
01:01:24,493 --> 01:01:28,974
[SPEAKER_05]: The minute you install Linux on anything, you are already reached geek levels.

855
01:01:29,414 --> 01:01:31,275
[SPEAKER_05]: The Mac is Linux.

856
01:01:31,335 --> 01:01:36,996
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the cool thing about it.

857
01:01:37,657 --> 01:01:41,138
[SPEAKER_05]: I know the Mac is Linux-based, but I'm talking about the hardcore stuff.

858
01:01:43,079 --> 01:01:45,900
[SPEAKER_05]: because even though the Mac runs on Linux now, it is still a Mac.

859
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:49,822
[SPEAKER_05]: It still feels like the old black and white Macs that we used to play Number Munchers on, okay?

860
01:01:51,402 --> 01:01:55,624
[SPEAKER_10]: I always played Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego, thank you very much.

861
01:01:55,664 --> 01:01:56,844
[SPEAKER_06]: I played that on my Commodore 64.

862
01:01:57,024 --> 01:01:58,525
[SPEAKER_06]: Dark Castle.

863
01:01:59,265 --> 01:02:00,166
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I'd like to correct you.

864
01:02:00,286 --> 01:02:01,506
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be black and green.

865
01:02:02,166 --> 01:02:03,947
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm eating this old school shit up.

866
01:02:04,087 --> 01:02:05,047
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, keep on going.

867
01:02:07,788 --> 01:02:08,449
[SPEAKER_06]: Oregon Trail, yo.

868
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:11,240
[SPEAKER_06]: I just, Kix.

869
01:02:11,781 --> 01:02:13,981
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, where is Oregon Trail on the PSP?

870
01:02:14,101 --> 01:02:14,962
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what we need.

871
01:02:15,162 --> 01:02:16,622
[SPEAKER_10]: No, Kix on an Apple IIe.

872
01:02:17,582 --> 01:02:19,903
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god, Kix, oh my god.

873
01:02:19,923 --> 01:02:21,584
[SPEAKER_05]: Was that the name of the Dark Castle?

874
01:02:21,664 --> 01:02:25,405
[SPEAKER_05]: It was only on a Mac, they didn't have it on PC, and you were going through, that game was sex.

875
01:02:25,725 --> 01:02:26,525
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a great game.

876
01:02:27,025 --> 01:02:29,906
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it was Kix and Lode Runner on an Apple IIe.

877
01:02:30,706 --> 01:02:32,647
[SPEAKER_02]: Lode Runner, oh my god.

878
01:02:32,707 --> 01:02:35,568
[SPEAKER_02]: I've lost countless bets trying to beat high scores in that game.

879
01:02:36,604 --> 01:02:39,404
[SPEAKER_05]: But see, all these games you all are talking about, they had on the Commodore 64.

880
01:02:39,444 --> 01:02:52,327
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, I remember sitting there with my TI-94 computer with the cartridge crappy thing, trying to program little bouncing balls, blipping the little blippy music in BASIC.

881
01:02:53,287 --> 01:02:58,508
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember loading BASIC stuff onto my TI-86, or not TI-86.

882
01:02:58,528 --> 01:02:59,288
[SPEAKER_05]: TI-85 calculator?

883
01:02:59,488 --> 01:03:00,188
[SPEAKER_06]: No, not 85.

884
01:03:00,368 --> 01:03:02,668
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the actual old... The TI-99?

885
01:03:03,729 --> 01:03:05,489
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's the old Texas Instrument computer.

886
01:03:06,518 --> 01:03:08,860
[SPEAKER_06]: No, not the calculator, actually the old computer.

887
01:03:09,300 --> 01:03:11,502
[SPEAKER_06]: Using a cassette tape, okay?

888
01:03:11,602 --> 01:03:12,523
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, I had one of those.

889
01:03:12,943 --> 01:03:16,666
[SPEAKER_05]: You owned a TI-99 and you dare to bash on Macs now?

890
01:03:17,426 --> 01:03:22,690
[SPEAKER_06]: No, this was when I was five, and it wasn't a TI-99, it was my first computer.

891
01:03:22,750 --> 01:03:24,371
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a Texas instrument when I was five.

892
01:03:25,072 --> 01:03:27,413
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not, um, TI-99 was a calculator.

893
01:03:27,533 --> 01:03:33,077
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm angry at my grandmother for throwing this thing away, but I had one of the old Coleco computers with a tape deck.

894
01:03:33,558 --> 01:03:34,098
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and Adam.

895
01:03:34,198 --> 01:03:34,879
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, jeez.

896
01:03:35,819 --> 01:03:38,401
[SPEAKER_10]: and my grandma threw it away and I was like, NO!

897
01:03:38,541 --> 01:03:39,362
[SPEAKER_10]: That's my album!

898
01:03:41,983 --> 01:03:44,365
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting side story about Texas Instruments.

899
01:03:44,465 --> 01:03:48,708
[SPEAKER_02]: I was the reason that they banned all the graphing calculators at my high school when I was going there.

900
01:03:49,229 --> 01:04:02,198
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually went out and sprung to get the data transfer cable and I downloaded tons of games for it like multiplayer Tetris and everything and I would bring them into school and then transfer them to other people's calculators and eventually

901
01:04:02,662 --> 01:04:06,665
[SPEAKER_02]: The entire 12th grade was doing nothing but playing games in class.

902
01:04:06,805 --> 01:04:15,991
[SPEAKER_05]: They hadn't figured that out yet when I was in high school because I had a nice graphing calculator and I was an AP Calculus and I was programming the complex formulas into my calculator so I could cheat on all the tests.

903
01:04:16,051 --> 01:04:16,731
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what, Rob?

904
01:04:17,251 --> 01:04:21,374
[SPEAKER_10]: I find it very funny that, you know, I think I graduated a year ahead of you, right?

905
01:04:21,454 --> 01:04:22,395
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

906
01:04:22,475 --> 01:04:26,057
[SPEAKER_10]: I was playing pole position on those calculators in history class.

907
01:04:26,257 --> 01:04:27,098
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, pole position.

908
01:04:27,919 --> 01:04:31,761
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkTetsuya is so winner for this comment in our chatroom.

909
01:04:31,881 --> 01:04:33,962
[SPEAKER_06]: He wants an Oregon Trail MMO.

910
01:04:33,982 --> 01:04:34,662
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

911
01:04:52,711 --> 01:04:53,272
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god.

912
01:04:53,292 --> 01:04:54,933
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, Oregon Trail MMO would rock.

913
01:04:55,053 --> 01:04:56,474
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki could die of dysentery.

914
01:04:56,614 --> 01:04:57,235
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay!

915
01:04:58,476 --> 01:05:00,098
[SPEAKER_02]: Oregon Trail Damacy.

916
01:05:00,378 --> 01:05:01,859
[SPEAKER_02]: No, honestly, that could work.

917
01:05:02,980 --> 01:05:04,802
[SPEAKER_05]: An Oregon Trail MMO could so work.

918
01:05:04,862 --> 01:05:05,762
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to get on that.

919
01:05:07,064 --> 01:05:08,945
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's start an online petition because those rock.

920
01:05:09,526 --> 01:05:12,108
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, online petitions always do the trick.

921
01:05:12,408 --> 01:05:14,470
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's what we should do.

922
01:05:14,510 --> 01:05:16,212
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to make an online petition.

923
01:05:16,232 --> 01:05:17,213
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll get it slash dotted.

924
01:05:19,963 --> 01:05:22,887
[SPEAKER_02]: Who the crap is going to play an Oregon Trail MMO?

925
01:05:23,007 --> 01:05:24,409
[SPEAKER_02]: Me, motherfucker, me!

926
01:05:25,851 --> 01:05:31,798
[SPEAKER_02]: You get to Oregon and then you have to build a castle and then you can make a blacksmith and put shoes on horses.

927
01:05:32,119 --> 01:05:32,940
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great fun.

928
01:05:34,283 --> 01:05:35,364
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, then you go back.

929
01:05:35,784 --> 01:05:36,865
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, here's the thing.

930
01:05:42,469 --> 01:05:48,432
[SPEAKER_05]: When we talk about the Oregon Trail, we always talked about the people who are going out west to seek a better life.

931
01:05:48,813 --> 01:05:53,796
[SPEAKER_05]: We never talked about those people that got there and then realized, this place sucks.

932
01:05:53,816 --> 01:05:54,476
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, wagons east.

933
01:05:57,598 --> 01:06:06,405
[SPEAKER_02]: Any game where you can have four people die because your wagon flooded in a river that's two inches deep is retarded.

934
01:06:08,787 --> 01:06:12,250
[SPEAKER_02]: I have major issues against Oregon Trail.

935
01:06:12,290 --> 01:06:15,213
[SPEAKER_23]: You need to make something more like Kingdom of Loathing.

936
01:06:15,373 --> 01:06:18,055
[SPEAKER_23]: OMG, looking for party, need to cross river.

937
01:06:20,057 --> 01:06:20,517
[SPEAKER_23]: Need cock.

938
01:06:21,135 --> 01:06:24,156
[SPEAKER_11]: Fear and Loathing in Oregon, yeah.

939
01:06:24,376 --> 01:06:25,136
[SPEAKER_05]: Morphine, please.

940
01:06:25,456 --> 01:06:28,277
[SPEAKER_05]: Looking for Black Mage who can cast Float on my fight.

941
01:06:29,098 --> 01:06:31,118
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe you'd see MRPH and PLZ.

942
01:06:33,159 --> 01:06:38,781
[SPEAKER_06]: Or my favorite is when I'd go hunting and I'd just kill everything and just have way too much meat.

943
01:06:40,179 --> 01:06:43,102
[SPEAKER_02]: You killed 40,000 pounds of meat, but you can only carry 100.

944
01:06:43,142 --> 01:06:45,484
[SPEAKER_02]: That used to happen to me all the time.

945
01:06:45,504 --> 01:06:48,847
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, PETA would be all over your ass in that MMO.

946
01:06:49,007 --> 01:06:50,988
[SPEAKER_05]: I was killing buffalo, like every buffalo in sight.

947
01:06:51,008 --> 01:06:51,749
[SPEAKER_02]: He smells like death.

948
01:06:51,769 --> 01:06:57,294
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, we're going to give him a... I love the smell of decay in the morning.

949
01:06:58,835 --> 01:07:02,938
[SPEAKER_02]: And then somebody's going to have a speed hack, and people are like, hey, you stole my bear kill.

950
01:07:03,058 --> 01:07:06,641
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, someone unlocked the sex hack in Oregon Trail.

951
01:07:08,496 --> 01:07:11,077
[SPEAKER_09]: And all it does is a bunch of women showing their ankles.

952
01:07:11,538 --> 01:07:14,839
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, we just unlocked this feature in Oregon Trail.

953
01:07:14,879 --> 01:07:20,802
[SPEAKER_05]: When we stop at the next fort, you can either shop for wagon parts or you can stop in for hot coffee.

954
01:07:20,922 --> 01:07:24,224
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the new add-on where you steal the Indians' land.

955
01:07:26,245 --> 01:07:29,247
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to know what the expansions are going to be, yo.

956
01:07:29,267 --> 01:07:30,687
[SPEAKER_02]: The Alaskan Trail!

957
01:07:32,228 --> 01:07:33,289
[SPEAKER_05]: The Canadian Trail.

958
01:07:34,316 --> 01:07:36,059
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, you have to dodge Mounties.

959
01:07:36,099 --> 01:07:38,842
[SPEAKER_02]: The Pacific Trail where they have to cross the ocean.

960
01:07:38,862 --> 01:07:39,623
[SPEAKER_06]: The Mexican Trail.

961
01:07:39,663 --> 01:07:44,169
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry, now I'm thinking of like a Ren and Simpy with the Royal Canadian Kilted Yaksman.

962
01:07:49,721 --> 01:07:52,102
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, was there ever a sequel to the Oregon Trail?

963
01:07:52,122 --> 01:07:52,982
[SPEAKER_05]: Like a different trail?

964
01:07:53,382 --> 01:07:54,822
[SPEAKER_05]: It was called Everybody's Dead!

965
01:07:54,842 --> 01:07:57,623
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it was a remake of the original thing and it sucked.

966
01:07:58,083 --> 01:07:58,943
[SPEAKER_02]: It sucked, really.

967
01:07:58,963 --> 01:08:00,984
[SPEAKER_05]: They needed a sequel to the Oregon Trail.

968
01:08:01,024 --> 01:08:02,764
[SPEAKER_05]: Every other... Number Munchers got a sequel.

969
01:08:02,784 --> 01:08:03,944
[SPEAKER_05]: They got Word Munchers.

970
01:08:04,424 --> 01:08:05,045
[SPEAKER_05]: What else was there?

971
01:08:05,065 --> 01:08:06,845
[SPEAKER_05]: What other classic... There's only one Oregon.

972
01:08:06,865 --> 01:08:10,986
[SPEAKER_02]: How can you make a sequel of a historical... How can you make another Oregon?

973
01:08:12,006 --> 01:08:13,608
[SPEAKER_02]: You could- Oregon Trail 2.

974
01:08:16,030 --> 01:08:19,372
[SPEAKER_10]: Oregon Trail 2 is back and it's pissed.

975
01:08:20,794 --> 01:08:21,114
[SPEAKER_02]: We made it!

976
01:08:21,134 --> 01:08:23,616
[SPEAKER_02]: We're taking the Oregon Trail through the ghetto now.

977
01:08:23,636 --> 01:08:26,418
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have to worry about drive-bys and crack whores.

978
01:08:27,319 --> 01:08:31,963
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you John Connor?

979
01:08:32,003 --> 01:08:33,845
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's gonna go through the ghetto it would have to be Oakland Trail.

980
01:08:34,125 --> 01:08:37,688
[SPEAKER_05]: There has to be another trail somewhere in the world that they could do a game off of.

981
01:08:38,068 --> 01:08:39,249
[SPEAKER_02]: The Iraqi Trail!

982
01:08:39,269 --> 01:08:39,910
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go!

983
01:08:42,726 --> 01:08:45,028
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to make it down the sand road.

984
01:08:45,128 --> 01:08:46,449
[SPEAKER_05]: Trail of a thousand tears.

985
01:08:46,609 --> 01:08:47,750
[SPEAKER_02]: We can do it.

986
01:08:47,770 --> 01:08:48,971
[SPEAKER_05]: Puerto Rican trail.

987
01:08:50,171 --> 01:08:51,212
Puerto Rican.

988
01:08:51,252 --> 01:08:52,693
Oh my god.

989
01:08:54,835 --> 01:08:58,898
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, this gets my vote as the most politically incorrect episode ever.

990
01:08:58,938 --> 01:08:59,518
[SPEAKER_05]: That's alright.

991
01:08:59,578 --> 01:09:00,519
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a landmark number.

992
01:09:00,539 --> 01:09:01,039
[SPEAKER_05]: We're okay.

993
01:09:01,740 --> 01:09:02,540
[SPEAKER_02]: What number is it?

994
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:03,701
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been like at a circuit.

995
01:09:03,881 --> 01:09:04,702
[SPEAKER_05]: It's 150 tonight.

996
01:09:04,942 --> 01:09:05,723
[SPEAKER_02]: It's divisible by 50.

997
01:09:06,103 --> 01:09:07,524
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it's divisible by 50.

998
01:09:08,424 --> 01:09:08,805
[SPEAKER_05]: And two.

999
01:09:08,845 --> 01:09:10,446
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy crap, I need another beer on that.

1000
01:09:10,751 --> 01:09:12,171
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, yeah, me too, I think so.

1001
01:09:12,251 --> 01:09:14,732
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, Reznor, any other closing thoughts?

1002
01:09:14,752 --> 01:09:17,373
[SPEAKER_05]: I gotta get some other calls, but we do enjoy having you on the show.

1003
01:09:17,393 --> 01:09:19,394
[SPEAKER_05]: You bring out the old school in us, I appreciate it.

1004
01:09:19,874 --> 01:09:21,734
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, you gotta keep in touch with your roots.

1005
01:09:22,354 --> 01:09:25,635
[SPEAKER_05]: Hell yes we do, so that's all I use my PSP for, Kid Icarus.

1006
01:09:26,636 --> 01:09:26,956
[SPEAKER_05]: Woot.

1007
01:09:27,336 --> 01:09:28,236
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, I'll let you go.

1008
01:09:28,336 --> 01:09:29,917
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a good one, my friend, and take care.

1009
01:09:29,937 --> 01:09:30,617
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for the call.

1010
01:09:31,557 --> 01:09:31,797
[SPEAKER_05]: Later.

[SPEAKER_05]: That was a fun call.

[SPEAKER_04]: I'm Chris DeCruz.

1029
01:10:27,293 --> 01:10:27,673
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.

1030
01:10:28,153 --> 01:10:28,513
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you?

1031
01:10:29,374 --> 01:10:31,275
[SPEAKER_04]: Quite frankly, I don't care if you know my real name.

1032
01:10:31,335 --> 01:10:31,595
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1033
01:10:31,655 --> 01:10:32,035
[SPEAKER_04]: That's fine.

1034
01:10:33,096 --> 01:10:33,456
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway...

1035
01:10:34,369 --> 01:10:40,235
[SPEAKER_04]: About the Mac and Intel thing, they're saying how you can run virtual PC on a Mac and play any of the PC games.

1036
01:10:41,115 --> 01:10:44,318
[SPEAKER_04]: Emulators cause massive slowdown, and it's not feasible at all.

1037
01:10:45,099 --> 01:10:46,801
[SPEAKER_10]: I know people who've done it.

1038
01:10:46,901 --> 01:10:50,985
[SPEAKER_05]: In the chat room it was kind of brought up, we kind of addressed this during the break, that it's more...

1039
01:10:51,465 --> 01:10:54,047
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to play the DOS-based games, you'd be okay.

1040
01:10:54,087 --> 01:10:55,208
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, the DOS-based games.

1041
01:10:55,488 --> 01:10:58,810
[SPEAKER_04]: But say, for example, Battlefield 2 is not going to be running.

1042
01:10:58,870 --> 01:10:59,650
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but you know what?

1043
01:10:59,690 --> 01:11:02,472
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to play Battlefield 2, you really should... Who wants to play that crap?

1044
01:11:03,313 --> 01:11:05,935
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, look, if you want to play Battlefield 2, you should own a PC anyway.

1045
01:11:05,975 --> 01:11:09,297
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm talking about Ragnarok and PSO, which I play on my laptop.

1046
01:11:10,718 --> 01:11:14,140
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, PSO and Ragnarok... Oh, Ragnarok is what?

1047
01:11:14,660 --> 01:11:15,401
[SPEAKER_04]: Sprite-based?

1048
01:11:15,481 --> 01:11:15,761
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1049
01:11:15,781 --> 01:11:18,563
[SPEAKER_04]: And PSO is six years old?

1050
01:11:18,583 --> 01:11:18,663
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1051
01:11:19,637 --> 01:11:21,739
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the PC version's new, but you're right.

1052
01:11:21,759 --> 01:11:23,620
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't give a shit about Final Fantasy XI.

1053
01:11:23,660 --> 01:11:24,601
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that game is ass.

1054
01:11:24,621 --> 01:11:26,362
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Final Fantasy XI is horrible.

1055
01:11:27,323 --> 01:11:28,884
[SPEAKER_10]: Which is why I quit it twice.

1056
01:11:30,685 --> 01:11:41,933
[SPEAKER_05]: Look, my response to the fact that the PC emulators on a Mac will play DOS-based games is I said, well, then it will play ZZT, and that's all you need.

1057
01:11:42,754 --> 01:11:42,974
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly.

1058
01:11:42,994 --> 01:11:44,635
[SPEAKER_04]: My DS will play DOS-based games.

1059
01:11:44,655 --> 01:11:45,576
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't understand your point.

1060
01:11:47,486 --> 01:11:48,806
[SPEAKER_06]: I want ZZT on the PSP.

1061
01:11:48,826 --> 01:11:54,788
[SPEAKER_03]: Go buy a PassMe and blank ROM cartridges and just install everything on there.

1062
01:11:58,089 --> 01:11:58,529
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1063
01:11:58,869 --> 01:12:01,289
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything else you want to share on the whole Mac versus PC thing?

1064
01:12:01,309 --> 01:12:04,350
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they're demanding me to get off this before you kick everyone else off.

1065
01:12:04,470 --> 01:12:05,730
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1066
01:12:05,950 --> 01:12:06,911
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for your input.

1067
01:12:09,771 --> 01:12:12,592
[SPEAKER_05]: We're getting passed around like a bong at this party.

1068
01:12:12,992 --> 01:12:13,392
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up?

1069
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:25,727
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, I'd like to ask, you're going to be on the East Coast in a few weeks, and are you going to be anywhere else but the place in New Jersey?

1070
01:12:27,508 --> 01:12:30,171
[SPEAKER_05]: Am I making any more live appearances, so to speak?

1071
01:12:30,691 --> 01:12:32,232
[SPEAKER_05]: No, nobody's really asked.

1072
01:12:33,573 --> 01:12:41,160
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm actually going out there for work, so my Monday through Fridays are kind of booked with the real world work stuff, but on the weekend I'm open to suggestions.

1073
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:43,822
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have something, just email me and I'll see what I can do.

1074
01:12:45,018 --> 01:12:46,199
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, alright then, we'll see.

1075
01:12:46,379 --> 01:12:48,761
[SPEAKER_05]: But the New Jersey thing right now is definite.

1076
01:12:48,981 --> 01:12:54,684
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to do the New Jersey tournament, because I haven't been to a DDR tournament in like years, so I think it would be funny to go to one on the East Coast for the first time, so.

1077
01:12:55,645 --> 01:12:57,246
[SPEAKER_23]: Make sure you kick those plugs, it kind of smells.

1078
01:12:57,546 --> 01:12:57,866
[SPEAKER_23]: Stop it.

1079
01:12:58,307 --> 01:12:58,887
[SPEAKER_23]: It does!

1080
01:12:58,967 --> 01:13:00,868
[SPEAKER_23]: I was in Philadelphia, it smelled like New Jersey!

1081
01:13:02,089 --> 01:13:02,389
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway.

1082
01:13:03,510 --> 01:13:05,812
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I've been there, it wasn't all that great, but it was alright.

1083
01:13:06,512 --> 01:13:07,112
[SPEAKER_05]: What's on your mind?

1084
01:13:07,152 --> 01:13:09,394
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't you go to some con recently you wanted to share with us, and...

1085
01:13:10,373 --> 01:13:11,094
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to New York?

1086
01:13:11,114 --> 01:13:11,654
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, anything...

1087
01:13:27,990 --> 01:13:30,392
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantasy, Sci-Fi, Nerd, stuff.

1088
01:13:31,092 --> 01:13:32,073
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's kind of like a Comic Con.

1089
01:13:32,093 --> 01:13:33,954
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's a big furry thing, if you want to know that.

1090
01:13:34,735 --> 01:13:35,996
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it's a furry convention.

1091
01:13:36,076 --> 01:13:36,596
[SPEAKER_05]: How lovely.

1092
01:13:36,756 --> 01:13:37,897
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no.

1093
01:13:38,758 --> 01:13:39,899
[SPEAKER_00]: That was just a large part of it.

1094
01:13:40,259 --> 01:13:40,899
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, well, okay.

1095
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:46,023
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's kind of like at an anime con out here, hentai is always a big part of it, no matter what.

1096
01:13:46,063 --> 01:13:46,904
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't escape it.

1097
01:13:47,584 --> 01:13:48,865
[SPEAKER_00]: No, hentai was big there, too.

1098
01:13:50,346 --> 01:13:51,207
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, there was...

1099
01:13:52,714 --> 01:13:57,096
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a big gaming room for anything gaming, huge screens, whatever.

1100
01:13:57,136 --> 01:13:59,958
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you get to play any new import game type things for the first time?

1101
01:14:01,558 --> 01:14:02,359
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I didn't get to.

1102
01:14:04,280 --> 01:14:10,383
[SPEAKER_05]: There was good stuff, but... I've been to Connecticut, it's not that awful.

1103
01:14:10,503 --> 01:14:11,804
[SPEAKER_00]: It's better than Delaware.

1104
01:14:12,844 --> 01:14:14,585
[SPEAKER_00]: It's better than Delaware, come on!

1105
01:14:15,646 --> 01:14:16,886
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not much to do in Connecticut.

1106
01:14:17,326 --> 01:14:18,407
[SPEAKER_05]: There's not much to do in Delaware.

1107
01:14:18,837 --> 01:14:19,357
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1108
01:14:44,721 --> 01:14:46,403
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to put SJ100 Matt on.

1109
01:14:46,663 --> 01:14:47,143
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds good.

1110
01:14:48,725 --> 01:14:49,646
[SPEAKER_05]: Puff, puff, pass.

1111
01:14:49,826 --> 01:14:50,106
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi.

1112
01:14:50,426 --> 01:14:50,686
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

1113
01:14:51,147 --> 01:14:53,088
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, what's up?

1114
01:14:53,148 --> 01:14:53,369
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.

1115
01:14:53,389 --> 01:15:00,675
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm going to elaborate a little bit more since Sephiroth is playing Smash Brothers, so... What?

1116
01:15:00,735 --> 01:15:02,936
[SPEAKER_05]: He's playing video games while he's trying to talk to us?

1117
01:15:03,577 --> 01:15:05,238
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we got several people here.

1118
01:15:05,258 --> 01:15:07,740
[SPEAKER_04]: He's trying to play video games and losing badly.

1119
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:08,221
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1120
01:15:09,081 --> 01:15:11,543
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, anyways... I can owe it all of you at Smash Brothers.

1121
01:15:11,623 --> 01:15:12,064
[SPEAKER_08]: Ha, ha, ha.

1122
01:15:13,263 --> 01:15:15,085
[SPEAKER_05]: They might take you up on that, be careful.

1123
01:15:15,325 --> 01:15:16,285
[SPEAKER_08]: They'll have to come to California.

1124
01:15:16,406 --> 01:15:17,326
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, I'm sorry.

1125
01:15:18,747 --> 01:15:21,069
[SPEAKER_01]: When the revolution comes out, we'll all be playing online.

1126
01:15:21,209 --> 01:15:22,130
[SPEAKER_05]: Aha, there you have it.

1127
01:15:22,770 --> 01:15:26,053
[SPEAKER_10]: And I will still own you all, because I am the master of Kirby.

1128
01:15:27,494 --> 01:15:28,014
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, sorry.

1129
01:15:28,214 --> 01:15:29,135
[SPEAKER_05]: What's on your mind, SSJ?

1130
01:15:30,236 --> 01:15:37,902
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the... Kineticon was really good in the fact that it had a lot of workshops, a lot of...

1131
01:15:38,933 --> 01:15:39,393
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura

1132
01:15:54,741 --> 01:16:00,723
[SPEAKER_01]: Gaming, Magic Cards, and other card game matches going on.

1133
01:16:01,623 --> 01:16:04,024
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, Magic Cards are still around?

1134
01:16:04,384 --> 01:16:04,604
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1135
01:16:05,044 --> 01:16:07,785
[SPEAKER_06]: My co-worker participates in tournaments.

1136
01:16:07,845 --> 01:16:10,286
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god, that was like ten years ago I was in a Magic Card.

1137
01:16:10,306 --> 01:16:15,207
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not knocking the Magic Cards thing, but I'm just saying, wow, I can't believe it has this longevity going on with it.

1138
01:16:15,307 --> 01:16:16,027
[SPEAKER_05]: This is crazy.

1139
01:16:16,047 --> 01:16:16,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, sorry.

1140
01:16:18,428 --> 01:16:20,909
[SPEAKER_01]: But, yeah, the gaming room, they had

1141
01:16:22,341 --> 01:16:26,552
[SPEAKER_01]: Smash Brothers Tournament going on, and they had a Halo 2 tournament going on.

1142
01:16:27,174 --> 01:16:28,317
[SPEAKER_05]: How was the Smash Brothers Tournament?

1143
01:16:28,337 --> 01:16:28,919
[SPEAKER_05]: I liked that game.

1144
01:16:29,621 --> 01:16:30,323
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, actually, we...

1145
01:16:31,656 --> 01:16:42,040
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, actually, we kind of entered it, but we didn't go to it, because it was like a couple-hour preliminary rounds and all that, so we didn't have time for that.

1146
01:16:42,181 --> 01:16:43,121
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotcha.

1147
01:16:43,201 --> 01:16:50,084
[SPEAKER_01]: But we donated a GameCube for a short time, which actually gave us tickets to the next Kineticon for free.

1148
01:16:50,164 --> 01:16:50,564
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, there you go.

1149
01:16:50,584 --> 01:16:51,725
[SPEAKER_05]: How often do they have Kineticon?

1150
01:16:51,745 --> 01:16:52,505
[SPEAKER_05]: Just once a year, or...?

1151
01:16:53,613 --> 01:16:54,073
[SPEAKER_01]: Once a year.

1152
01:16:54,133 --> 01:16:58,234
[SPEAKER_01]: This was the first time that they had it in the big Hartford Convention Center.

1153
01:16:58,434 --> 01:16:58,954
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, right on.

1154
01:16:59,674 --> 01:17:00,614
[SPEAKER_01]: For Connecticut, that's big.

1155
01:17:00,894 --> 01:17:01,414
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really big.

1156
01:17:03,055 --> 01:17:03,515
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, well.

1157
01:17:06,215 --> 01:17:12,516
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pasting a link to the pictures on the chat room.

1158
01:17:13,157 --> 01:17:13,517
[SPEAKER_05]: Right on.

1159
01:17:13,557 --> 01:17:17,117
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope our listeners want to check that out, especially if they're on the East Coast and missed it.

1160
01:17:17,177 --> 01:17:19,878
[SPEAKER_05]: Then they can see everything they missed, and they'll go next year.

1161
01:17:19,898 --> 01:17:20,858
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1162
01:17:21,414 --> 01:17:26,277
[SPEAKER_01]: and they had a Beatmania tournament, a poppin' music tournament.

1163
01:17:26,437 --> 01:17:28,098
[SPEAKER_05]: What style were they doing the Beatmania thing on?

1164
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:32,521
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard someone mention 8, but I'm not positive.

1165
01:17:32,601 --> 01:17:32,901
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1166
01:17:35,323 --> 01:17:45,429
[SPEAKER_01]: Poppin' music, I think they had some sort of tournament to win like a Naruto customized poppin' music pad or something, which looked interesting.

1167
01:17:47,170 --> 01:17:49,792
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, of course, the dealer room, which was interesting.

1168
01:17:50,786 --> 01:17:52,627
[SPEAKER_01]: and plenty of cosplays.

1169
01:17:53,507 --> 01:17:55,748
[SPEAKER_05]: Any scary cosplays?

1170
01:17:57,549 --> 01:17:58,329
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you mean scary?

1171
01:17:58,869 --> 01:17:59,829
[SPEAKER_05]: He's talking about boobies.

1172
01:18:00,250 --> 01:18:03,151
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm talking about, like, super fat Sailor Moon.

1173
01:18:04,671 --> 01:18:07,092
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm talking about the guys who dress up like... Sailor Menchi.

1174
01:18:07,252 --> 01:18:12,854
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm talking about fat men who dress up like my... Sailor Menchi.

1175
01:18:13,315 --> 01:18:19,777
[SPEAKER_01]: There were a couple of really scary ones, you know, the chubby girls who thought they could be Kagome from Inuyasha.

1176
01:18:21,383 --> 01:18:25,144
[SPEAKER_01]: from the WNFL Ares.

1177
01:18:25,525 --> 01:18:28,405
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we saw a WNFL Ares.

1178
01:18:29,626 --> 01:18:30,766
[SPEAKER_05]: Like Final Fantasy 7?

1179
01:18:30,846 --> 01:18:36,728
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, you know, she looked like she could play in the NFL.

1180
01:18:37,328 --> 01:18:38,069
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay, I get it.

1181
01:18:38,089 --> 01:18:39,209
[SPEAKER_05]: Quite scary.

1182
01:18:39,969 --> 01:18:46,531
[SPEAKER_01]: There was one girl who wore a Darkstalkers costume.

1183
01:18:47,732 --> 01:18:48,452
[SPEAKER_01]: Very revealing.

1184
01:18:48,672 --> 01:18:49,012
[SPEAKER_05]: I see.

1185
01:18:51,768 --> 01:18:52,948
[SPEAKER_05]: How about any good cosplay?

1186
01:18:52,968 --> 01:18:53,589
[SPEAKER_05]: Were there good ones?

1187
01:18:54,870 --> 01:18:55,470
[SPEAKER_01]: There were several.

1188
01:18:55,510 --> 01:18:59,132
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually posted up a lot of the good ones in the chat room.

1189
01:19:01,033 --> 01:19:02,634
[SPEAKER_05]: Check out the pictures there.

1190
01:19:03,875 --> 01:19:09,058
[SPEAKER_14]: Did somebody say Goatse cosplay?

1191
01:19:09,098 --> 01:19:09,918
[SPEAKER_05]: That's disgusting.

1192
01:19:10,478 --> 01:19:14,280
[SPEAKER_10]: How would one cosplay that?

1193
01:19:14,421 --> 01:19:15,441
[SPEAKER_05]: Very slowly.

1194
01:19:15,801 --> 01:19:16,822
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be real pain in the ass.

1195
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:22,685
[SPEAKER_01]: Out of the 12 people in this small room, there's about 11 of them who are wise asses.

1196
01:19:23,966 --> 01:19:26,129
[SPEAKER_05]: There's 12 people over there?

1197
01:19:26,930 --> 01:19:27,631
[SPEAKER_01]: In a tiny room, yeah.

1198
01:19:27,671 --> 01:19:30,054
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, that's more people than listen to our show regularly.

1199
01:19:30,134 --> 01:19:31,375
[SPEAKER_05]: And everyone's fully clothed.

1200
01:19:31,916 --> 01:19:32,216
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1201
01:19:33,558 --> 01:19:33,879
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

1202
01:19:34,299 --> 01:19:34,900
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I might add...

1203
01:19:35,907 --> 01:19:38,929
[SPEAKER_01]: are actually voting for you on that whole thing that you have.

1204
01:19:39,009 --> 01:19:40,310
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, the Podcast Awards thing?

1205
01:19:40,750 --> 01:19:40,930
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1206
01:19:41,130 --> 01:19:41,931
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you kindly.

1207
01:19:42,191 --> 01:19:43,492
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't even remember to mention this.

1208
01:19:43,512 --> 01:19:47,314
[SPEAKER_05]: We got nominated Best Gaming Podcast over on PodcastAwards.com.

1209
01:19:47,374 --> 01:19:49,275
[SPEAKER_05]: Go vote for us, because we like attention.

1210
01:19:50,716 --> 01:19:54,318
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, actually, I have a quick little story that happened at Kineticon.

1211
01:19:54,438 --> 01:19:54,818
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1212
01:19:56,199 --> 01:19:59,201
[SPEAKER_01]: My buddy Sephiroth was playing, what song was it?

1213
01:20:00,302 --> 01:20:00,662
[SPEAKER_01]: At least.

1214
01:20:01,275 --> 01:20:02,936
[SPEAKER_01]: Could this kid even play 2DX?

1215
01:20:02,996 --> 01:20:11,739
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I've had the kids at Roosevelt Golf Land that are like 12 years old try to make fun of me.

1216
01:20:29,554 --> 01:20:33,838
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it's like, you know, well, dude, if you're so good at DDR, you want to play a match against me?

1217
01:20:33,878 --> 01:20:36,260
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll pick the song, you know, Healing Vision Angelic Mix or something.

1218
01:20:36,460 --> 01:20:38,362
[SPEAKER_01]: I hinted that to him.

1219
01:20:38,382 --> 01:20:47,530
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, well, I've seen him play a couple times, but, you know, he plays on 1.5 and 2X, and if you don't do that, you're considered a noob.

1220
01:20:48,631 --> 01:20:49,072
[SPEAKER_17]: Huh.

1221
01:20:50,153 --> 01:20:51,554
[SPEAKER_01]: But, no, you know what?

1222
01:20:52,895 --> 01:20:55,297
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't want to, like, get into an argument with him.

1223
01:20:55,337 --> 01:20:56,018
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't want to, like,

1224
01:20:56,676 --> 01:20:59,218
[SPEAKER_01]: Be mean to him because he's like a 16-year-old kid.

1225
01:20:59,258 --> 01:21:06,464
[SPEAKER_01]: I think with his overweightness, I'm sure life has already dealt a poor hand to him.

1226
01:21:07,545 --> 01:21:11,788
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you sometimes wonder what happens to children to make them turn out so strange.

1227
01:21:12,689 --> 01:21:18,373
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but he was very rude, so I had to step in and save my friend over here.

1228
01:21:18,533 --> 01:21:21,836
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than that, Kineticon was very good.

1229
01:21:21,896 --> 01:21:21,996
[SPEAKER_01]: It's

1230
01:21:22,990 --> 01:21:24,351
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to tell you one thing.

1231
01:21:24,371 --> 01:21:25,251
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, he has one thing to say.

1232
01:21:25,832 --> 01:21:28,733
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to meet Tiffany Grant, who is also the voice of Asuka.

1233
01:21:30,014 --> 01:21:30,494
[SPEAKER_05]: Right on.

1234
01:21:31,294 --> 01:21:36,037
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, we met Piano Squall, if you know who that is.

1235
01:21:36,677 --> 01:21:37,197
[SPEAKER_05]: No idea.

1236
01:21:39,418 --> 01:21:42,680
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to be honest, I don't follow the anime thing that closely.

1237
01:21:42,820 --> 01:21:47,783
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I like some of it, but... There's one thing that you're going to be jealous of, and we got to meet Freeze Pop.

1238
01:21:48,503 --> 01:21:49,543
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome.

1239
01:21:50,224 --> 01:21:50,904
[SPEAKER_01]: I am jealous.

1240
01:21:51,144 --> 01:21:52,545
[SPEAKER_05]: I am jealous.

1241
01:21:53,263 --> 01:21:54,743
[SPEAKER_05]: I got to meet Togo at E3.

1242
01:21:54,763 --> 01:21:55,544
[SPEAKER_05]: That was kind of cool.

1243
01:21:56,724 --> 01:21:59,025
[SPEAKER_05]: Do I get a cookie for that?

1244
01:21:59,425 --> 01:21:59,705
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1245
01:21:59,865 --> 01:22:01,945
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to let you go so you guys can get back to your party.

1246
01:22:02,105 --> 01:22:02,946
[SPEAKER_05]: We get back to our show.

1247
01:22:04,186 --> 01:22:04,706
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all right.

1248
01:22:06,147 --> 01:22:07,747
[SPEAKER_05]: For 12 people, I can make the time.

1249
01:22:08,067 --> 01:22:10,548
[SPEAKER_05]: That's twice our normal listenership.

1250
01:22:10,588 --> 01:22:10,988
[SPEAKER_05]: That's huge.

1251
01:22:11,228 --> 01:22:11,508
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1252
01:22:13,148 --> 01:22:13,849
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a good time, kids.

1253
01:22:15,889 --> 01:22:16,689
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye.

1254
01:22:19,750 --> 01:22:20,450
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, my gosh.

1255
01:22:20,751 --> 01:22:21,931
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge listening parties.

1256
01:22:21,951 --> 01:22:22,471
[SPEAKER_05]: Who would have thought?

1257
01:22:23,601 --> 01:22:24,902
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, we're going to go to a break, kids.

1258
01:22:24,922 --> 01:22:28,003
[SPEAKER_05]: When we come back from this break, we're going to do the Cage Match, some other news going on.

1259
01:22:28,323 --> 01:22:31,384
[SPEAKER_05]: We're doing Happy Sky Music tonight, going to continue on with that theme.

1260
01:22:31,684 --> 01:22:35,746
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to have in this break, we're going to have a song, a brand new Akira Yamaoka song is going to start it off.

1261
01:22:35,766 --> 01:22:41,128
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to have a song that's actually a Papa Music crossover in this break as well, and a song named after a dog.

1262
01:22:41,488 --> 01:22:42,368
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll all be in this break.

1263
01:22:42,748 --> 01:22:47,250
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio and the Cage Match and the FUs of the week.

1264
01:22:47,970 --> 01:22:51,732
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe some Ask Orange Lounge if we have time, and if we get around to it, some actual DDR news.

1265
01:22:51,832 --> 01:22:52,252
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be back.

1266
01:22:55,097 --> 01:22:56,179
Thank you for watching!

1267
01:23:48,825 --> 01:23:49,596
Thanks for watching!

1268
01:24:37,370 --> 01:24:38,190
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for watching!

1269
01:26:02,971 --> 01:26:03,934
Thanks for watching!

1270
01:26:54,958 --> 01:26:56,199
Thanks for watching!

1271
01:28:08,048 --> 01:28:09,350
Thank you for watching

1272
01:30:51,914 --> 01:30:59,641
[SPEAKER_21]: For up to a minute of Ammanian gaming news, discussion forums, and for access to the chat room, visit our website at orangeloungeradio.com Happy Sky

1273
01:31:16,124 --> 01:31:21,870
[SPEAKER_05]: Zephyr, a very epic song in there, and then Y&Co, folks behind Monkey Dance, Daisuki, their new song, Poodle!

1274
01:31:22,631 --> 01:31:22,891
[SPEAKER_05]: Cute.

1275
01:31:25,054 --> 01:31:28,335
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I see you over there, DarkSakura, reading the new Harry Potter.

1276
01:31:28,655 --> 01:31:30,175
[SPEAKER_10]: I did the same thing last time.

1277
01:31:30,255 --> 01:31:35,456
[SPEAKER_05]: I do remember when that... God, this show's been on a long time, because I remember when the last book came out.

1278
01:31:35,816 --> 01:31:39,476
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to say when Goblet of Fire came out, you were on here, too, but I think that might have been before.

1279
01:31:39,576 --> 01:31:40,957
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, yeah, I was.

1280
01:31:41,937 --> 01:31:42,357
[SPEAKER_08]: Were you?

1281
01:31:42,497 --> 01:31:42,997
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, my gosh.

1282
01:31:43,437 --> 01:31:51,979
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I've got to ask you about this, because this was something that was kind of pissing me off, but it seems like there's kids on the Internet that are loving spoiling this new book.

1283
01:31:52,839 --> 01:31:53,999
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think about this whole thing?

1284
01:31:54,739 --> 01:31:55,359
[SPEAKER_05]: The spoiler.

1285
01:31:55,479 --> 01:31:57,520
[SPEAKER_10]: So what?

1286
01:31:57,560 --> 01:31:59,121
[SPEAKER_10]: You have the option of reading it or not?

1287
01:31:59,722 --> 01:32:06,385
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but there's people that have gone on LiveJournal and they'll post it in their journal, not behind a cut, in really big font, the big spoiler, so that all their friends can read it.

1288
01:32:06,405 --> 01:32:07,125
[SPEAKER_10]: Nobody's done that on mine.

1289
01:32:07,605 --> 01:32:10,847
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, because they know you'll defriend their ass, but I've seen it on mine.

1290
01:32:11,286 --> 01:32:11,926
[SPEAKER_10]: I wouldn't do that.

1291
01:32:11,966 --> 01:32:12,386
[SPEAKER_10]: That's petty.

1292
01:32:13,227 --> 01:32:15,868
[SPEAKER_10]: But to post a spoiler like that is petty, isn't it?

1293
01:32:16,948 --> 01:32:18,549
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it's stupid.

1294
01:32:18,589 --> 01:32:25,331
[SPEAKER_10]: It's rude, but it's not something that's worth all of a sudden not being somebody's friend over.

1295
01:32:25,991 --> 01:32:30,193
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it would really depend on how close you were with somebody in the first place, though.

1296
01:32:30,213 --> 01:32:33,574
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's just somebody you just kind of knew on the internet, they added you because they thought their LJ was cool.

1297
01:32:33,614 --> 01:32:35,335
[SPEAKER_05]: But if it was somebody I knew in real life...

1298
01:32:35,720 --> 01:32:38,182
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't do it, but I don't know.

1299
01:32:38,342 --> 01:32:41,464
[SPEAKER_10]: Nobody has posted any big-fonted spoilers on my live journal.

1300
01:32:41,484 --> 01:32:42,325
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I just think...

1301
01:32:43,752 --> 01:32:44,952
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, let people have their thing.

1302
01:32:44,972 --> 01:32:47,313
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it has to do with the general character of the people I've been friending.

1303
01:32:47,713 --> 01:32:51,675
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's good, but I mean, I think, I'm just kind of like, you know what, let people have their thing.

1304
01:32:51,975 --> 01:33:11,321
[SPEAKER_05]: You might be making fun of the Harry Potter thing, but let's face it, you listen to a DDR radio show, I'm not talking about you guys specifically, I don't think anybody that listens to this show is in on this, but you know, the people that are posting spoilers, it's like, you know what, and then they go, oh, I'm spoiling it because Harry Potter fanboys are stupid.

1305
01:33:11,841 --> 01:33:14,262
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm just like, you know what, you probably got your stupid thing too.

1306
01:33:14,602 --> 01:33:16,163
[SPEAKER_05]: How would you like me to go take a dump on that?

1307
01:33:18,583 --> 01:33:21,364
[SPEAKER_10]: I already know what's going to happen, so I don't care.

1308
01:33:22,945 --> 01:33:24,245
[SPEAKER_10]: For me, it's how they get there.

1309
01:33:27,086 --> 01:33:31,908
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, I decided I would have a Guinness in celebration of our 150th episode.

1310
01:33:31,928 --> 01:33:34,489
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm having a celebratory drink since I don't have to drive tonight.

1311
01:33:34,829 --> 01:33:35,889
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm having an upset stomach.

1312
01:33:36,830 --> 01:33:38,010
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm supposed to plug something.

1313
01:33:38,030 --> 01:33:41,131
[SPEAKER_05]: They actually made a chat room called Channel Oregon Trail.

1314
01:33:44,167 --> 01:33:50,748
[SPEAKER_05]: to discuss the latest news and events behind everybody's favorite upcoming MMO, The Oregon Trail Strikes Back.

1315
01:33:52,088 --> 01:33:53,009
[SPEAKER_05]: So join that channel.

1316
01:33:53,269 --> 01:33:53,829
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a good time.

1317
01:33:56,049 --> 01:33:56,389
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1318
01:33:57,269 --> 01:33:57,549
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

1319
01:33:58,789 --> 01:33:59,170
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

1320
01:33:59,250 --> 01:34:03,970
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving on with other news going on throughout the gaming world and the Bomani world.

1321
01:34:04,330 --> 01:34:13,492
[SPEAKER_05]: DDR with Mario had their site open up and it actually happened a little while ago but it kind of happened under the radar because I think a lot of people might have given up on DDR with Mario once they heard that

1322
01:34:13,991 --> 01:34:14,912
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

1323
01:34:31,502 --> 01:34:32,823
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, heavy or whatever it was.

1324
01:34:32,843 --> 01:34:37,745
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it was the hardest, hardest difficulty, because not all songs had that, but it was like one below it.

1325
01:34:38,026 --> 01:34:40,067
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was about the equivalent of Five Footer, and I triple-a'd it.

1326
01:34:40,367 --> 01:34:43,909
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm not the type of person that sits there and triple-a's all these songs on DDR.

1327
01:34:43,929 --> 01:34:47,971
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I've done some, but I'm by no means like this excellent DDR player.

1328
01:34:48,631 --> 01:34:51,554
[SPEAKER_05]: So, DDR with Mario is kind of simple.

1329
01:34:53,776 --> 01:34:59,781
[SPEAKER_05]: But the Japanese site opened up for DDR with Mario because I believe the game actually might have come out in Japan.

1330
01:35:00,022 --> 01:35:01,903
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to be honest, I haven't really been following this.

1331
01:35:03,024 --> 01:35:04,806
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it did just a few days ago.

1332
01:35:04,866 --> 01:35:07,448
[SPEAKER_05]: July 14th was the release date in Japan.

1333
01:35:07,648 --> 01:35:08,950
[SPEAKER_05]: So, there you have it.

1334
01:35:09,070 --> 01:35:11,612
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can look at the website and look at all the features and

1335
01:35:12,634 --> 01:35:13,234
[SPEAKER_05]: All that stuff.

1336
01:35:13,334 --> 01:35:16,435
[SPEAKER_05]: Although it's all in Japanese, so unless you can read Japanese, you're not going to be able to read it.

1337
01:35:17,215 --> 01:35:19,476
[SPEAKER_05]: Unless you run it through a translator or something.

1338
01:35:22,977 --> 01:35:24,578
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, so I guess that's some big Bumani news.

1339
01:35:25,738 --> 01:35:31,680
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's interesting because there's still a lot of speculation going on with the new DDRs coming out, Extreme 2 and Ultramix 3.

1340
01:35:32,340 --> 01:35:37,582
[SPEAKER_05]: Just kind of been keeping a pulse on what's going on on the DDR-freak threads, which is where the majority of the discussion's been occurring.

1341
01:35:38,002 --> 01:35:42,343
[SPEAKER_05]: I think a lot of people were expecting Extreme 2 to make a debut at Comic-Con

1342
01:35:43,066 --> 01:35:44,107
[SPEAKER_05]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1343
01:35:55,683 --> 01:35:56,343
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1344
01:36:23,539 --> 01:36:24,119
[SPEAKER_06]: Still the date.

1345
01:36:24,820 --> 01:36:27,923
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the only one that got pushed back was Karaoke Revolution Party.

1346
01:36:28,123 --> 01:36:32,546
[SPEAKER_06]: It got pushed back one week later, so it's not coming out the same day as Ultramix 3.

1347
01:36:32,606 --> 01:36:34,648
[SPEAKER_06]: It's coming out the week after that.

1348
01:36:34,828 --> 01:36:37,410
[SPEAKER_05]: I heard some things were going on with Karaoke Revolution Party, but I can't talk about them.

1349
01:36:38,671 --> 01:36:41,033
[SPEAKER_06]: You can tell me, because I pretty much know everything that's going on.

1350
01:36:41,053 --> 01:36:41,714
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't.

1351
01:36:41,754 --> 01:36:42,695
[SPEAKER_05]: Why can't you tell me?

1352
01:36:43,135 --> 01:36:44,516
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's have this discussion off air, please.

1353
01:36:45,377 --> 01:36:46,418
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1354
01:36:47,759 --> 01:36:48,580
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's going to rock.

1355
01:36:48,600 --> 01:36:49,520
[SPEAKER_05]: You all should pick that up.

1356
01:36:51,624 --> 01:37:05,730
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there's Ultramix 3, which I think is interesting because one of the very most recent posts in the Ultramix 3 thread was by somebody who's actually in our chat room right now, Renee, although I always want to say Rini, because there's so many E's.

1357
01:37:06,010 --> 01:37:07,150
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to get punched for saying that.

1358
01:37:07,431 --> 01:37:11,732
[SPEAKER_05]: But it actually referenced our own site and the lovely DarkSakura, her photo gallery.

1359
01:37:11,792 --> 01:37:14,914
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember how you took just a shitload of pictures of E3 of everything?

1360
01:37:15,034 --> 01:37:15,334
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1361
01:37:15,454 --> 01:37:17,935
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, somebody finally decided to look at the pictures and

1362
01:37:18,015 --> 01:37:18,796
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1363
01:37:39,935 --> 01:37:48,217
[SPEAKER_05]: But the things that were shown here, Emi being in a schoolgirl outfit, I didn't realize people didn't know that before, but yes, Emi was in a schoolgirl outfit in the E3 demo, and it was cute.

1364
01:37:48,317 --> 01:37:48,737
[SPEAKER_05]: I liked it.

1365
01:37:49,118 --> 01:37:50,358
[SPEAKER_05]: Just like the graduation video.

1366
01:37:53,599 --> 01:37:56,720
[SPEAKER_06]: I liked slut Emi better, though, for Ultramix 2.

1367
01:37:56,900 --> 01:37:58,280
[SPEAKER_08]: Slut Emi was a piece of shit.

1368
01:38:00,881 --> 01:38:02,781
[SPEAKER_06]: I liked slut Emi, too, actually.

1369
01:38:02,901 --> 01:38:04,562
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a lot of fan service, though.

1370
01:38:06,842 --> 01:38:09,103
[SPEAKER_10]: If you guys got slut Emi, I'd get hands-less rage.

1371
01:38:12,054 --> 01:38:12,354
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway.

1372
01:38:14,556 --> 01:38:16,197
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, it's not three-titted Emmy.

1373
01:38:16,337 --> 01:38:17,838
[SPEAKER_06]: It's only, you know, slut Emmy.

1374
01:38:17,878 --> 01:38:20,099
[SPEAKER_06]: So you'd have to get... And I'd get man-poor rage.

1375
01:38:20,360 --> 01:38:24,102
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you'd have to get, like, rage in tight shorts or something.

1376
01:38:26,183 --> 01:38:32,347
[SPEAKER_05]: The result screen is a, and I quote, bubbly bubble bubbly bub in the background, and not fancy, just plain and simple.

1377
01:38:32,408 --> 01:38:33,068
[SPEAKER_05]: However, it shows...

1378
01:38:33,442 --> 01:38:34,603
[SPEAKER_05]: How many calories you've burned.

1379
01:38:34,643 --> 01:38:36,925
[SPEAKER_05]: Doesn't look like workout mode because the numerical score is shown.

1380
01:38:37,345 --> 01:38:39,267
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't even notice that when I was playing.

1381
01:38:39,547 --> 01:38:44,031
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've been saying for like two years now that they just need to integrate workout mode into the normal DDR.

1382
01:38:44,331 --> 01:38:46,313
[SPEAKER_05]: So if that actually happened, that makes me very happy.

1383
01:38:46,453 --> 01:38:49,956
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't even notice that when I was playing, but I was just so jazzed to be playing Ultramix 3.

1384
01:38:50,156 --> 01:38:52,198
[SPEAKER_05]: I wasn't looking for all the little things when I was playing it.

1385
01:38:53,479 --> 01:38:58,383
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's very cool because I don't think workout mode should be separate because you can't unlock things when you play in workout mode.

1386
01:38:58,423 --> 01:38:59,524
[SPEAKER_05]: At least I don't think you can.

1387
01:39:00,861 --> 01:39:11,828
[SPEAKER_05]: But from what I remember about Ultramix 3 and the interface, basically, take Ultramix 2 and replace whatever blue futuristic background thing they had with the bubbles, and that was Ultramix 3's interface.

1388
01:39:13,269 --> 01:39:14,029
[SPEAKER_05]: The main part of it.

1389
01:39:14,910 --> 01:39:20,113
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you want to see that, that's over on DDR Freak.

1390
01:39:20,774 --> 01:39:22,595
[SPEAKER_05]: And I will get my pictures up at some point.

1391
01:39:22,675 --> 01:39:25,797
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think my pictures show anything new about the game, but I guess you never know.

1392
01:39:26,417 --> 01:39:28,779
[SPEAKER_06]: But you do have a picture of me with Mario.

1393
01:39:28,799 --> 01:39:28,879
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1394
01:39:29,528 --> 01:39:31,449
[SPEAKER_05]: I do have a picture of you with Mario, and it rocks.

1395
01:39:31,469 --> 01:39:33,129
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a picture of me with Mario, and one with Link.

1396
01:39:33,429 --> 01:39:37,270
[SPEAKER_05]: I took some pictures of the Beatmania demo, too, but the Beatmania demo really didn't have anything in it.

1397
01:39:37,350 --> 01:39:41,492
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the Beatmania demo was just Night Style plus Oh My God's five key songs in it.

1398
01:39:41,732 --> 01:39:42,172
[SPEAKER_11]: Woo!

1399
01:39:43,092 --> 01:39:49,854
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was stuck on Training... What the hell is the one-star mode called?

1400
01:39:49,874 --> 01:39:50,494
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't even remember.

1401
01:39:51,015 --> 01:39:51,695
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Beginner Mode.

1402
01:39:52,135 --> 01:39:54,636
[SPEAKER_05]: Seven Key Mode was stuck on Beginner Mode, which I thought was kind of funny.

1403
01:39:55,476 --> 01:39:58,637
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's not going to be that way in the regular release, so don't worry, guys.

1404
01:40:02,481 --> 01:40:04,902
[SPEAKER_05]: Any day now we should start finding out new songs for these games.

1405
01:40:04,922 --> 01:40:09,305
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm surprised no new artists have leaked out what songs are going to be in it or anything like that.

1406
01:40:09,546 --> 01:40:10,586
[SPEAKER_05]: Not yet.

1407
01:40:10,987 --> 01:40:12,928
[SPEAKER_05]: We should start finding out some songs pretty soon.

1408
01:40:12,968 --> 01:40:15,750
[SPEAKER_05]: I would hope that they're going to put out a finalized release pretty soon.

1409
01:40:16,110 --> 01:40:22,955
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, before that, don't you think, when the press gets a hold of these games, they're going to start posting pictures on their website?

1410
01:40:23,035 --> 01:40:24,936
[SPEAKER_05]: Has GamePro reviewed it again yet?

1411
01:40:25,577 --> 01:40:27,138
[SPEAKER_05]: Not yet, but you know it'll happen.

1412
01:40:28,699 --> 01:40:33,580
[SPEAKER_06]: I swear, does Konami not learn with GamePro?

1413
01:40:34,241 --> 01:40:41,362
[SPEAKER_06]: I would seriously try to sue them for, you know... Well, no, because it created buzz for their games.

1414
01:40:41,462 --> 01:40:42,923
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it had a positive effect.

1415
01:40:43,803 --> 01:40:46,064
[SPEAKER_05]: It created buzz on the games and got people talking.

1416
01:40:46,144 --> 01:40:47,264
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god, here's the song list.

1417
01:40:47,304 --> 01:40:47,944
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god, oh my god.

1418
01:40:48,324 --> 01:40:50,145
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, I don't think it was a bad thing.

1419
01:40:50,205 --> 01:40:51,085
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't sue them over it.

1420
01:40:51,425 --> 01:40:52,605
[SPEAKER_05]: It got people talking about the game.

1421
01:40:52,665 --> 01:40:53,386
[SPEAKER_05]: Free advertising.

1422
01:40:54,166 --> 01:40:57,047
[SPEAKER_06]: Where I'd make them review the Ninja Turtles game over and over and over again.

1423
01:40:57,847 --> 01:40:58,287
[SPEAKER_06]: Or Frogger.

1424
01:41:02,715 --> 01:41:05,278
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright kids, I think it's time to get into tonight's cage match.

1425
01:41:05,319 --> 01:41:18,196
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to be a part of the cage match, you've got to join our chat room over at www.orangeloungeradio.com Alright, and the way the cage match works...

1426
01:41:19,718 --> 01:41:22,719
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to play three songs for you guys, last week's winner.

1427
01:41:22,739 --> 01:41:25,999
[SPEAKER_05]: A clip of it, anyway, because it won last week, so you've already heard the song.

1428
01:41:26,359 --> 01:41:29,240
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to play that, and then we're going to play two new songs for you guys.

1429
01:41:29,560 --> 01:41:41,542
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys vote on your favorite, and the winner goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's Bomani Music & More program, which plays 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, on the station when we are not live.

1430
01:41:41,562 --> 01:41:42,783
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, here it is.

1431
01:41:43,323 --> 01:41:44,803
[SPEAKER_05]: Last week in the cage match.

1432
01:41:45,676 --> 01:41:46,817
[SPEAKER_05]: Blur with Girls and Boys

1433
01:42:16,605 --> 01:42:17,834
Thanks for watching!

1434
01:42:38,104 --> 01:42:46,927
My battery's been cut Can't look for someone to pray for My thing is nothing is wasted Only repurchase You cannot be blessed

1435
01:42:57,791 --> 01:42:59,714
Thanks for watching!

1436
01:43:50,301 --> 01:44:02,128
[SPEAKER_14]: Girls who are boys, who like boys To be girls who did boys like they girls Who did girls like they boys Always should be someone you really like

1437
01:44:15,509 --> 01:44:17,790
Thanks for watching!

1438
01:44:47,099 --> 01:44:49,340
Thanks for watching!

1439
01:45:17,967 --> 01:45:18,447
[SPEAKER_05]: Woopies!

1440
01:45:19,028 --> 01:45:19,668
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, anyway.

1441
01:45:21,309 --> 01:45:25,491
[SPEAKER_05]: We're gonna get into song number two of tonight's Cage Match, so that was song number one, Blur with Girls and Boys.

1442
01:45:25,531 --> 01:45:26,432
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's song number two.

1443
01:45:26,912 --> 01:45:43,882
[SPEAKER_05]: Song number two tonight is my pick, and I decided to pick, um, I kinda like the new, um, Utada album, so, um, I picked a song that's actually a remix, because I like this remix, because it's different than the song on the album, and, um, I think it's a little bit better.

1444
01:45:44,673 --> 01:45:48,277
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was also just desperate to find something at the last minute, so I just went ahead and picked this one.

1445
01:45:48,658 --> 01:45:50,601
[SPEAKER_05]: So here it is, song number two of tonight's cage match.

1446
01:45:50,661 --> 01:45:54,947
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Utada with Exodus 04, the Double J Radio Mix.

1447
01:47:37,498 --> 01:47:38,761
Thank you for watching!

1448
01:49:47,441 --> 01:49:52,885
[SPEAKER_05]: Song number two in tonight's cage match, that was Utada with Exodus 04.

1449
01:49:53,465 --> 01:49:54,446
[SPEAKER_05]: It smells like beer in here.

1450
01:49:55,327 --> 01:49:56,047
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder why.

1451
01:49:56,388 --> 01:50:00,591
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see if that song should go on in Exodus or if it should stay here forever.

1452
01:50:01,231 --> 01:50:01,711
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.

1453
01:50:03,212 --> 01:50:07,656
[SPEAKER_10]: Kind of generic and sounds like all the rest of her stuff, so it gets a six.

1454
01:50:08,536 --> 01:50:08,857
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki.

1455
01:50:09,277 --> 01:50:16,302
[SPEAKER_06]: I like the instrumental, but the vocals just sounded like... I guess it just sounds like her, so... It was okay, it was just...

1456
01:50:18,532 --> 01:50:22,236
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree on that it's a little repetitive, but it's kind of a dance mix.

1457
01:50:22,696 --> 01:50:26,541
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think it improves on the original, because I don't like the original.

1458
01:50:26,561 --> 01:50:28,023
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like a low-energy dance mix.

1459
01:50:28,083 --> 01:50:31,246
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's kind of a closing time.

1460
01:50:31,907 --> 01:50:36,773
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm standing there drunk, and I'm kind of bobbing my head to the music.

1461
01:50:37,631 --> 01:50:38,912
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so I give it like an eight.

1462
01:50:39,252 --> 01:50:41,735
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, song number three, Loki's pick.

1463
01:50:41,755 --> 01:50:43,016
[SPEAKER_06]: What did you pick for us tonight, Loki?

1464
01:50:43,116 --> 01:50:45,258
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, if you want retro, here's retro right here.

1465
01:50:45,638 --> 01:50:46,038
[SPEAKER_06]: Sort of.

1466
01:50:46,158 --> 01:50:47,019
[SPEAKER_06]: It's retro redone.

1467
01:50:47,079 --> 01:50:49,521
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Stayin' Alive.

1468
01:50:49,781 --> 01:50:51,063
[SPEAKER_06]: Like the Bee Gees?

1469
01:50:51,343 --> 01:50:54,165
[SPEAKER_06]: Like the Bee Gees, but done by Ozzy Osbourne.

1470
01:50:56,827 --> 01:50:57,468
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1471
01:50:57,788 --> 01:50:58,169
[SPEAKER_06]: It's good.

1472
01:50:59,470 --> 01:50:59,650
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

1473
01:51:00,225 --> 01:51:00,526
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait.

1474
01:51:00,746 --> 01:51:01,347
[SPEAKER_06]: Staying Alive.

1475
01:51:01,407 --> 01:51:02,830
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I have this.

1476
01:51:03,551 --> 01:51:04,353
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, here we go.

1477
01:51:04,373 --> 01:51:05,314
[SPEAKER_10]: I already know what I'm reading it.

1478
01:51:05,615 --> 01:51:06,236
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, here we go.

1479
01:51:06,316 --> 01:51:09,081
[SPEAKER_05]: Song number three, Staying Alive by Ozzy Osbourne.

1480
01:51:09,121 --> 01:51:09,362
[SPEAKER_05]: Enjoy.

1481
01:51:26,087 --> 01:51:26,728
Oh yeah!

1482
01:51:26,788 --> 01:51:31,832
Well, you can't deal with the way I use my work I'm a woman's man, sometimes it's all easy-going

1483
01:51:53,163 --> 01:51:54,504
Thank you for watching!

1484
01:52:36,002 --> 01:52:37,103
Thank you for watching!

1485
01:52:54,332 --> 01:52:59,879
[SPEAKER_14]: Day in the Life, Day in the Life, Day in the Life, Day in the Life, Day in the Life

1486
01:53:20,687 --> 01:53:36,419
[SPEAKER_14]: It's alright, it's okay, we may go the other way We can try to understand, but we don't have nothing to say It's alright, it's okay, let's see another day We can try to understand, but we don't have nothing to say Ha ha ha ha ha

1487
01:55:17,304 --> 01:55:18,786
Thank you for watching!

1488
01:55:55,019 --> 01:55:58,462
[SPEAKER_05]: now my ass smells like beer because I sat in the wet beer part of the chair

1489
01:55:59,421 --> 01:56:01,823
[SPEAKER_05]: Song number three, Ozzy Osbourne, Stayin' Alive.

1490
01:56:03,424 --> 01:56:03,945
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think?

1491
01:56:04,045 --> 01:56:06,106
[SPEAKER_05]: Stayin' Alive or should we pull the plug on that song?

1492
01:56:06,146 --> 01:56:06,807
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.

1493
01:56:06,867 --> 01:56:08,468
[SPEAKER_10]: Stayin' Alive was a crap movie.

1494
01:56:11,030 --> 01:56:16,594
[SPEAKER_10]: I've had that particular song for quite a while now and I've listened to it quite a lot.

1495
01:56:17,334 --> 01:56:19,396
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think it's a wonderful cover.

1496
01:56:19,476 --> 01:56:20,096
[SPEAKER_10]: It's fun.

1497
01:56:20,857 --> 01:56:23,539
[SPEAKER_10]: But I don't think it's cage-matchy, so it gets a seven and a half.

1498
01:56:23,559 --> 01:56:23,639
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki.

1499
01:56:24,480 --> 01:56:24,820
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki.

1500
01:56:25,572 --> 01:56:30,376
[SPEAKER_06]: It was all I got in five minutes, so it gets an eight.

1501
01:56:31,858 --> 01:56:35,481
[SPEAKER_05]: My synopsis, somewhere the disco train derailed.

1502
01:56:35,661 --> 01:56:36,442
[SPEAKER_05]: I give it a five.

1503
01:56:37,183 --> 01:56:41,066
[SPEAKER_06]: It was the crazy train, not the disco train.

1504
01:56:41,506 --> 01:56:46,251
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, boys and girls, we're going to recap the three songs, and then you get to place your vote.

1505
01:56:46,291 --> 01:56:50,655
[SPEAKER_05]: Song number one you can vote for tonight is Girls and Boys.

1506
01:57:00,450 --> 01:57:14,997
[SPEAKER_05]: and song number two you can vote for tonight is Exodus 04 by Utada and song number three you can vote for tonight is Ozzy Osbourne with Stayin' Alive that just cracks me up to say

1507
01:57:20,728 --> 01:57:23,250
[SPEAKER_05]: Please vote now.

1508
01:57:23,470 --> 01:57:33,039
[SPEAKER_05]: Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote for song number one, The Blur, song number two, The Utada, or song number three, The Aussie.

1509
01:57:33,279 --> 01:57:33,639
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1510
01:57:33,719 --> 01:57:36,221
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Stand Alive would be cool if it was in Guitar Freaks.

1511
01:57:37,322 --> 01:57:37,963
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, that would be cool.

1512
01:57:38,163 --> 01:57:41,926
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there's the Guitar Heroes coming out, and it's supposed to have a lot of covers.

1513
01:57:41,966 --> 01:57:43,788
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to have Bowie in it, which is cool.

1514
01:57:44,148 --> 01:57:45,849
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to have Hendrix.

1515
01:57:45,889 --> 01:57:47,551
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be the total stoner game.

1516
01:57:48,755 --> 01:57:51,078
[SPEAKER_06]: Guitar Freaks needs something different.

1517
01:57:51,098 --> 01:57:54,401
[SPEAKER_06]: They really, I'm very disappointed that they got rid of Keyboard Mania.

1518
01:57:55,062 --> 01:57:55,503
[SPEAKER_05]: Me too.

1519
01:57:55,523 --> 01:58:02,811
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that was kind of, they should have instead of getting rid of games that plug with Guitar Freaks, they should have added stuff to it.

1520
01:58:02,931 --> 01:58:03,171
[SPEAKER_11]: Mm-hmm.

1521
01:58:03,632 --> 01:58:11,958
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, maybe a karaoke game to go with it, you know, and you can sing the vocals to the songs, or maybe, I don't know, another instrument or something that they could be playing?

1522
01:58:11,978 --> 01:58:12,938
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I know, I know.

1523
01:58:13,459 --> 01:58:22,485
[SPEAKER_05]: Keyboard Mania, the reason why I'm pissed off that Konami got rid of Keyboard Mania is because Keyboard Mania was a one-but-money game that it was actually pretty good at, that a lot of people don't take the time to be good at.

1524
01:58:22,785 --> 01:58:27,267
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I got really good at Keyboard Mania, and it was, like, I wasn't blue good, but I was good.

1525
01:58:27,628 --> 01:58:30,389
[SPEAKER_05]: I can actually pass songs on doubles, which I think is good.

1526
01:58:31,109 --> 01:58:34,371
[SPEAKER_05]: And I can pass, like, six, like, I can pass, like, you know, most of the six stars.

1527
01:58:34,411 --> 01:58:40,094
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the only one I could never pass was the crazy one from, I don't even remember the name of it, it's been so long since I've played.

1528
01:58:40,314 --> 01:58:44,096
[SPEAKER_05]: But it pissed me off, because I was like, you know, I could have, I could have been really good.

1529
01:58:44,176 --> 01:58:47,578
[SPEAKER_05]: I could have been a contender at Keyboard Mania, and they went and pulled the plug on my game.

1530
01:58:47,598 --> 01:58:47,938
[SPEAKER_05]: Bastard.

1531
01:58:48,547 --> 01:58:48,727
[SPEAKER_05]: D.R.O.S.C.

1532
01:58:48,767 --> 01:58:49,428
[SPEAKER_00]: Psychopath Edition

1533
01:59:09,181 --> 01:59:11,602
[SPEAKER_06]: because most of the entries dropped out.

1534
01:59:11,742 --> 01:59:13,563
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, eight songs.

1535
01:59:14,203 --> 01:59:21,266
[SPEAKER_06]: The theme of this mix was basically, or this contest was basically... Dude, I got eighth place in the SimFile competition.

1536
01:59:21,346 --> 01:59:21,806
[SPEAKER_05]: I rock.

1537
01:59:22,286 --> 01:59:24,467
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's basically funny songs.

1538
01:59:24,567 --> 01:59:25,207
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the point.

1539
01:59:25,988 --> 01:59:32,450
[SPEAKER_06]: So they picked funny songs, did step files for them, and right now, basically, you can go download them.

1540
01:59:32,490 --> 01:59:37,813
[SPEAKER_06]: It's on the front page of MyStyle, and there's reviews and discussion.

1541
01:59:38,413 --> 01:59:39,013
[SPEAKER_06]: So go check them out.

1542
01:59:39,312 --> 01:59:39,592
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess.

1543
01:59:40,672 --> 01:59:43,293
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm sure there's another tourney mix coming and we don't care.

1544
01:59:46,913 --> 01:59:48,054
[SPEAKER_05]: What number tourney mix is this?

1545
01:59:48,474 --> 01:59:49,394
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that'd be six.

1546
01:59:51,634 --> 01:59:52,774
[SPEAKER_05]: What happened to tourney mix five?

1547
01:59:53,534 --> 01:59:55,015
[SPEAKER_06]: No, five happened.

1548
01:59:55,635 --> 01:59:55,975
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought.

1549
01:59:55,995 --> 01:59:57,655
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought five happened.

1550
01:59:58,375 --> 01:59:59,135
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't keep track of it.

1551
01:59:59,155 --> 02:00:00,456
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't follow that stuff anymore.

1552
02:00:00,496 --> 02:00:02,136
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe five didn't happen.

1553
02:00:02,196 --> 02:00:03,276
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe it was four I'm thinking of.

1554
02:00:03,676 --> 02:00:06,157
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, so five, tourney mix five is supposed to happen.

1555
02:00:06,177 --> 02:00:08,077
[SPEAKER_06]: The rules are going to get more retarded and

1556
02:00:09,253 --> 02:00:16,777
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly, it's... Are they going to remove the names of the people who made the... No, no, no, the one intelligent... We've been saying this for years.

1557
02:00:16,917 --> 02:00:21,860
[SPEAKER_05]: The way to make Tourney Mix fair is to remove the names of the people who made the step files until the end.

1558
02:00:22,460 --> 02:00:24,441
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the way to do it.

1559
02:00:24,521 --> 02:00:30,484
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the only way you can judge fairly instead of making it just a popularity contest.

1560
02:00:30,584 --> 02:00:34,166
[SPEAKER_06]: But no, they're not going to do that because they're retarded.

1561
02:00:34,266 --> 02:00:35,246
[SPEAKER_06]: So, whatever.

1562
02:00:36,207 --> 02:00:36,587
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't care.

1563
02:00:38,988 --> 02:00:44,111
[SPEAKER_06]: and nothing else going on as far as Japanese mix type things.

1564
02:00:44,952 --> 02:00:48,293
[SPEAKER_06]: No one's really making any progress, so who knows.

1565
02:00:49,594 --> 02:00:51,255
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone's busy playing games or something.

1566
02:00:53,976 --> 02:00:54,977
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

1567
02:00:55,037 --> 02:00:55,197
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1568
02:00:56,458 --> 02:00:57,258
[SPEAKER_05]: Should we go to a call?

1569
02:00:57,278 --> 02:01:00,360
[SPEAKER_05]: We're getting a call on the Skype line even though I had it turned off, but why not, huh?

1570
02:01:00,460 --> 02:01:00,820
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

1571
02:01:00,840 --> 02:01:01,320
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, why not?

1572
02:01:01,340 --> 02:01:02,201
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll pick up this call.

1573
02:01:03,922 --> 02:01:05,343
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1574
02:01:07,424 --> 02:01:07,744
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello?

1575
02:01:07,784 --> 02:01:07,884
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello?

1576
02:01:10,603 --> 02:01:14,165
[SPEAKER_17]: Hi, Turnimix 5 came out a while ago.

1577
02:01:14,405 --> 02:01:15,146
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it was last year.

1578
02:01:16,246 --> 02:01:27,432
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see how much... You know what, honestly, I have to admit, I kind of got off the Turnimix train a while ago just because it was kind of getting... To me, in my opinion, it was getting way overrated.

1579
02:01:27,712 --> 02:01:29,813
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, people were taking Turnimix way too seriously.

1580
02:01:30,153 --> 02:01:33,735
[SPEAKER_05]: And taking the people that were successful in Turnimix way too seriously.

1581
02:01:34,135 --> 02:01:39,718
[SPEAKER_05]: And there would be good stuff that would be put in Turnimix that nobody would download because they didn't know the person who did it.

1582
02:01:40,279 --> 02:01:47,633
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't pay any attention to forum drama, I just download the actual songs and everything and delete the ones I don't like.

1583
02:01:52,088 --> 02:01:55,170
[SPEAKER_05]: Tons of new step files for your step mania.

1584
02:01:55,390 --> 02:02:02,595
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll tell you what, one other good thing about it is that I actually pick up usually a couple new good songs that I like that I wouldn't have thought to download before.

1585
02:02:02,755 --> 02:02:06,057
[SPEAKER_05]: Because there's a couple people out there that have similar taste in music than I do.

1586
02:02:06,117 --> 02:02:06,657
[SPEAKER_05]: Who would have thought?

1587
02:02:06,978 --> 02:02:09,539
[SPEAKER_05]: And so sometimes I find good new music through Tournament Mix.

1588
02:02:09,619 --> 02:02:12,361
[SPEAKER_05]: So for that, I support it, but that's about it.

1589
02:02:13,822 --> 02:02:17,725
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I mean, I don't even know who are on any of them because I just don't pay attention.

1590
02:02:17,745 --> 02:02:18,105
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm-hmm.

1591
02:02:19,144 --> 02:02:22,691
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, it's just, I don't care who wins, I just care about, you know, what's there.

1592
02:02:22,972 --> 02:02:24,174
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you ever enter these things?

1593
02:02:25,377 --> 02:02:25,577
[SPEAKER_17]: What?

1594
02:02:25,737 --> 02:02:27,100
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you ever enter the competitions?

1595
02:02:27,160 --> 02:02:29,385
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh no, I don't make any sim files because I'm not very good.

1596
02:02:30,938 --> 02:02:32,899
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what my problem with making sim files is?

1597
02:02:32,979 --> 02:02:39,245
[SPEAKER_05]: I make heavy steps, and then I don't have the time or effort to make standard or light steps.

1598
02:02:39,865 --> 02:02:42,047
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody's paying me to do it, so I don't have any incentive.

1599
02:02:42,267 --> 02:02:44,950
[SPEAKER_05]: And then my art skills are ass-tastic.

1600
02:02:45,310 --> 02:02:47,812
[SPEAKER_05]: I cannot draw backgrounds for crap.

1601
02:02:48,193 --> 02:02:55,819
[SPEAKER_05]: And honestly, it's kind of sad, but if you have a good background, it'll make your step file ten times better in some people's opinions.

1602
02:02:56,139 --> 02:02:57,941
[SPEAKER_05]: So for that reason, I don't do step files.

1603
02:03:00,044 --> 02:03:01,385
[SPEAKER_17]: Was I supposed to identify myself?

1604
02:03:01,745 --> 02:03:02,805
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, what's your name?

1605
02:03:04,166 --> 02:03:09,428
[SPEAKER_05]: GameBoyGuy13 Hello GameBoyGuy13 Are you also DSGuy13 or are you just strictly GameBoy?

1606
02:03:11,789 --> 02:03:25,676
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have a DS because I don't have money That's a reason that stops a lot of us from getting a DS, so I sympathize with you there I don't even have an SP, I want one but don't have one Oh no, so you're playing on an old style Advance?

1607
02:03:26,496 --> 02:03:28,697
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, just an Advance Do you have a backlight on it?

1608
02:03:30,126 --> 02:03:30,986
[SPEAKER_17]: No, it's an advance.

1609
02:03:31,326 --> 02:03:35,327
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah, but, you know, you can get those things modded, put afterburners in them.

1610
02:03:36,868 --> 02:03:37,948
[SPEAKER_05]: You poor guy.

1611
02:03:38,188 --> 02:03:38,588
[SPEAKER_05]: My God.

1612
02:03:38,928 --> 02:03:42,029
[SPEAKER_05]: The first wave of Game Boy Advances were bad.

1613
02:03:42,229 --> 02:03:43,089
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, for that reason.

1614
02:03:43,129 --> 02:03:44,910
[SPEAKER_05]: It needed a backlight so bad.

1615
02:03:45,130 --> 02:03:47,670
[SPEAKER_05]: But you were a brave man for putting up with it this whole time.

1616
02:03:48,450 --> 02:03:52,671
[SPEAKER_17]: What's really funny is I went in a used game store and found a really old Game Boy for like five bucks.

1617
02:03:53,892 --> 02:03:55,812
[SPEAKER_17]: I considered buying it, but decided not to.

1618
02:03:56,112 --> 02:03:57,412
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the old paperweight Game Boys?

1619
02:03:58,293 --> 02:03:58,913
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

1620
02:04:01,058 --> 02:04:07,326
[SPEAKER_05]: I would buy a Virtual Boy for $5 just so I can give my friends headaches.

1621
02:04:07,886 --> 02:04:09,808
[SPEAKER_05]: Come here, play this cool new game I got.

1622
02:04:09,829 --> 02:04:10,549
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, I have one.

1623
02:04:11,130 --> 02:04:11,711
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you really?

1624
02:04:12,449 --> 02:04:13,009
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought you knew.

1625
02:04:13,710 --> 02:04:16,851
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you have every system under the sun, so it really shouldn't be a surprise.

1626
02:04:17,351 --> 02:04:22,194
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to do a show at your house eventually and whip out all the old game systems and play them on air.

1627
02:04:22,514 --> 02:04:24,715
[SPEAKER_08]: I am not going to play the Virtual Boy.

1628
02:04:25,135 --> 02:04:27,296
[SPEAKER_05]: I will drink and play Virtual Boy on air.

1629
02:04:27,677 --> 02:04:31,979
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't play that for more than five minutes without getting a raging headache that makes me have to pass out.

1630
02:04:32,819 --> 02:04:33,599
[SPEAKER_05]: What games do you have?

1631
02:04:34,980 --> 02:04:35,660
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, hell if I know.

1632
02:04:35,681 --> 02:04:36,521
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't touch the damn thing.

1633
02:04:37,113 --> 02:04:39,774
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have the Mario Crash or whatever it was?

1634
02:04:40,094 --> 02:04:42,455
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and Tennis and something else.

1635
02:04:43,095 --> 02:04:44,396
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember the old stupid commercials.

1636
02:04:45,936 --> 02:04:48,717
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, yes, Loki, I forgot to mention.

1637
02:04:49,057 --> 02:04:51,558
[SPEAKER_06]: Tourney Mix 6 is actually going on right now.

1638
02:04:52,899 --> 02:04:57,140
[SPEAKER_06]: And they call it Tourney Mix Final because, thank God, they're not doing it anymore.

1639
02:04:57,820 --> 02:04:59,401
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, it says...

1640
02:05:00,221 --> 02:05:02,422
[SPEAKER_06]: The deadline for registration is July 25th.

1641
02:05:02,462 --> 02:05:04,903
[SPEAKER_06]: Deadline for file submission is the 29th.

1642
02:05:04,983 --> 02:05:07,464
[SPEAKER_06]: Your basic rules format here.

1643
02:05:08,284 --> 02:05:09,284
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see here.

1644
02:05:09,925 --> 02:05:11,405
[SPEAKER_06]: Score breakdown and info.

1645
02:05:11,425 --> 02:05:13,406
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see what we got here.

1646
02:05:13,526 --> 02:05:13,886
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on.

1647
02:05:14,206 --> 02:05:14,886
[SPEAKER_06]: Load.

1648
02:05:15,647 --> 02:05:20,848
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, DDR East Coast Invasion, which is a site that I haven't been to in a long time.

1649
02:05:22,829 --> 02:05:24,370
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, and it's working so well, too.

1650
02:05:24,890 --> 02:05:27,051
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, the info, you can find it there...

1651
02:05:29,212 --> 02:05:30,093
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, okay, we get it.

1652
02:05:30,153 --> 02:05:30,753
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Turnimix.

1653
02:05:31,113 --> 02:05:31,753
[SPEAKER_05]: It hasn't changed.

1654
02:05:31,874 --> 02:05:34,015
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, anything else you want to share with us, Game Boy Guy?

1655
02:05:34,575 --> 02:05:34,935
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, oh.

1656
02:05:34,995 --> 02:05:35,636
[SPEAKER_11]: Not really.

1657
02:05:36,036 --> 02:05:37,677
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, then, Game Boy Guy, I'm going to say goodbye.

1658
02:05:37,897 --> 02:05:39,298
[SPEAKER_05]: But thank you for calling in, and have a great night.

1659
02:05:40,258 --> 02:05:40,859
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh-huh, you too.

1660
02:05:40,959 --> 02:05:41,259
[SPEAKER_06]: Later.

1661
02:05:42,519 --> 02:05:42,860
[SPEAKER_06]: Get this.

1662
02:05:43,060 --> 02:05:45,621
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the song restrictions and time length restrictions.

[SPEAKER_06]: You may use songs from other rhythm and game music, or rhythm and game music games.

1665
02:06:02,753 --> 02:06:04,075
[SPEAKER_06]: Hooray, more 2DX whores.

1666
02:06:04,255 --> 02:06:04,835
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no, no.

1667
02:06:05,076 --> 02:06:08,099
[SPEAKER_06]: You get penalties for using games for 2DX.

1668
02:06:08,119 --> 02:06:15,847
[SPEAKER_06]: You get minus 10 points penalty, popping music, minus 10, beat mania, minus 3, para, para, para, minus 2, martial beats, minus 2, um...

1669
02:06:17,535 --> 02:06:17,835

[SPEAKER_06]: Parappa the Rapper, Minus Two, Unjammy Lemmy, Minus Two, Frequency Minus Two, Amplitude Minus Two, Takano Tatragin, Minus Two, Guitaroman Minus Two.

[SPEAKER_05]: No minus points for Bust a Move.

1672
02:06:29,360 --> 02:06:31,321
[SPEAKER_06]: Remixes, though, you get plus five.

1673
02:06:32,761 --> 02:06:35,482
[SPEAKER_06]: Completely custom remix, plus five.

1674
02:06:35,502 --> 02:06:44,306
[SPEAKER_06]: Tsugaru Four, whatever, Su Four, whatever that is, plus one, basically, it's like, I don't know, B4U Max plus zero.

1675
02:06:45,026 --> 02:06:45,847
[SPEAKER_05]: Plus zero?

1676
02:06:45,887 --> 02:06:46,367
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the point?

1677
02:06:46,670 --> 02:06:50,373
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, they're talking about how good the remixes are.

1678
02:06:51,033 --> 02:06:52,815
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, whatever.

1679
02:06:52,835 --> 02:06:53,335
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever.

1680
02:06:53,976 --> 02:07:00,961
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's over 2 minutes 40 seconds, you get a 5-point deduction, and it keeps going up from there.

1681
02:07:03,042 --> 02:07:03,643
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just like...

1682
02:07:05,033 --> 02:07:07,876
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, they score you on background animations, one point.

1683
02:07:07,896 --> 02:07:08,716
[SPEAKER_06]: Movies, one point.

1684
02:07:09,377 --> 02:07:10,698
[SPEAKER_06]: Challenge steps, one point.

1685
02:07:11,299 --> 02:07:13,200
[SPEAKER_06]: These are additional to what you're doing.

1686
02:07:13,741 --> 02:07:15,482
[SPEAKER_06]: Beginning steps, you get another point.

1687
02:07:15,642 --> 02:07:17,184
[SPEAKER_06]: Double steps, you get one to four points.

1688
02:07:17,344 --> 02:07:20,226
[SPEAKER_06]: Lyrics, one to four points.

1689
02:07:21,047 --> 02:07:26,151
[SPEAKER_06]: Breakdowns, it says all entries are counted and checked for correct file formatting errors.

1690
02:07:26,652 --> 02:07:28,753
[SPEAKER_06]: Entries are then randomly sorted in the brackets.

1691
02:07:29,374 --> 02:07:31,556
[SPEAKER_06]: Each week, a bracket will be released to the public.

1692
02:07:32,076 --> 02:07:32,817
[SPEAKER_06]: And it says...

1693
02:07:34,065 --> 02:07:35,685
[SPEAKER_06]: Public will have no say in the first round.

1694
02:07:35,725 --> 02:07:37,046
[SPEAKER_06]: Public's sway has been removed.

1695
02:07:38,186 --> 02:07:38,506
[SPEAKER_04]: Good.

1696
02:07:39,726 --> 02:07:40,286
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see here.

1697
02:07:40,746 --> 02:07:53,289
[SPEAKER_06]: The number of judges will be working on 10 points for light, 25 for standard, 50 for heavy, 5 points for appropriate danceable step file, 5 points for readme, 5 points for background and banner.

1698
02:07:53,309 --> 02:07:55,189
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

1699
02:07:55,229 --> 02:07:58,430
[SPEAKER_06]: If you get 80 points, it grants you to the next round.

1700
02:07:58,530 --> 02:08:02,891
[SPEAKER_06]: Total of 100 extra entries plus 5 penalties minus 35.

1701
02:08:04,491 --> 02:08:04,951
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I know.

1702
02:08:04,991 --> 02:08:22,464
[SPEAKER_06]: It's basically... Anyways, I'm just trying to see how... I was trying to see if they had the actual... whether or not the people's names would be displayed, but it does not say, so I'm going to have to assume that's a yes.

1703
02:08:23,464 --> 02:08:26,186
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're really interested, ddrei.com.

1704
02:08:26,566 --> 02:08:27,167
[SPEAKER_06]: Have fun.

1705
02:08:27,207 --> 02:08:28,328
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the last one, thank God.

1706
02:08:28,688 --> 02:08:29,048
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1707
02:08:29,608 --> 02:08:31,210
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys want to hear who won tonight's cage match?

1708
02:08:32,350 --> 02:08:32,651
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess.

1709
02:08:32,971 --> 02:08:33,211
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1710
02:08:33,834 --> 02:08:35,375
[SPEAKER_05]: Tonight was a landslide victory, by the way.

1711
02:08:35,395 --> 02:08:36,336
[SPEAKER_05]: We haven't had one of these in a while.

1712
02:08:36,356 --> 02:08:39,257
[SPEAKER_05]: We've had a lot of ties lately, but tonight was a freaking landslide.

1713
02:08:39,417 --> 02:08:39,638
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1714
02:08:39,998 --> 02:08:40,758
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep, it sure was.

1715
02:08:41,218 --> 02:08:43,120
[SPEAKER_05]: So here it is, tonight's winner, boys and girls.

1716
02:08:45,821 --> 02:08:46,702
[SPEAKER_05]: Ozzy Osbourne.

1717
02:08:49,564 --> 02:08:50,344
[SPEAKER_05]: Stayin' alive.

1718
02:08:51,265 --> 02:08:52,205
[SPEAKER_05]: Sheep, all of you.

1719
02:08:54,366 --> 02:08:54,767
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1720
02:08:56,047 --> 02:08:58,829
[SPEAKER_03]: All aboard the disco train!

1721
02:08:59,269 --> 02:08:59,910
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, no, no, no, no.

1722
02:08:59,930 --> 02:09:00,250
[SPEAKER_05]: Sharon!

1723
02:09:00,270 --> 02:09:00,810
[SPEAKER_05]: Sharon!

1724
02:09:02,251 --> 02:09:03,072
[SPEAKER_03]: Sharon!

1725
02:09:04,201 --> 02:09:05,061
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's take a break.

1726
02:09:05,081 --> 02:09:05,701
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to take a break.

1727
02:09:05,722 --> 02:09:08,202
[SPEAKER_05]: When we come back, we'll get into the FUs of the week, most definitely.

1728
02:09:08,862 --> 02:09:12,023
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, if somebody else wants to give us a call via Skype, talk about Happy Sky a little bit.

1729
02:09:12,464 --> 02:09:16,045
[SPEAKER_05]: And whatever else we can dig out of our butts when we come back from this break.

1730
02:09:16,185 --> 02:09:16,785
[SPEAKER_05]: Lots of poo.

1731
02:09:17,525 --> 02:09:18,225
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's start off with this.

1732
02:09:19,086 --> 02:09:22,447
[SPEAKER_05]: Some poor person in the chatroom has been begging me to play this song all night long.

1733
02:09:22,467 --> 02:09:22,887
[SPEAKER_05]: So here it is.

1734
02:09:22,907 --> 02:09:27,008
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to start it out with a song called 12th Style, which is what the game should be called.

1735
02:09:27,148 --> 02:09:27,448
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn it.

1736
02:09:28,029 --> 02:09:28,989
[SPEAKER_05]: So here it is, 12th Style.

1737
02:09:29,009 --> 02:09:30,309
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be back with more.

1738
02:09:31,009 --> 02:09:32,650
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy Orange Lounge Radio after this.

1739
02:09:35,945 --> 02:09:37,510
Thanks for watching!

1740
02:11:38,186 --> 02:11:39,206
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, what did you think of that song?

1741
02:11:40,527 --> 02:11:41,408
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought it was lame.

1742
02:11:42,849 --> 02:11:44,010
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's some Akira Yamaoka then.

1743
02:14:36,620 --> 02:14:37,423
DarkSakura

1744
02:15:16,332 --> 02:15:17,175
Thanks for watching!

1745
02:15:40,592 --> 02:15:44,173
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you ever walked into Radio Shack and hit the demo button on all the keyboards?

1746
02:15:46,154 --> 02:15:49,896
[SPEAKER_05]: So that you have like 60 keyboard demos all playing over the top of each other all at once.

1747
02:15:49,916 --> 02:15:50,716
[SPEAKER_10]: That sounded like yuck.

1748
02:15:50,896 --> 02:15:52,717
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what that song sounded like to me.

1749
02:15:52,937 --> 02:15:54,738
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly, that sounded like me playing the keyboard.

1750
02:15:54,818 --> 02:15:57,479
[SPEAKER_06]: And I can't play the keyboard, so that's what it would sound like.

1751
02:15:58,621 --> 02:16:01,082
[SPEAKER_06]: That was just a bunch of random notes and beats.

1752
02:16:01,142 --> 02:16:03,603
[SPEAKER_06]: It just had nothing to... It was not even a song.

1753
02:16:03,843 --> 02:16:04,624
[SPEAKER_06]: Needs more cowbell.

1754
02:16:05,604 --> 02:16:06,905
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

1755
02:16:07,225 --> 02:16:08,346
[SPEAKER_06]: Needs less suckiness.

1756
02:16:08,726 --> 02:16:13,188
[SPEAKER_06]: Where they have some... I had my cat walk across the keyboard.

1757
02:16:13,668 --> 02:16:14,649
[SPEAKER_05]: One more song to go, please.

1758
02:16:14,769 --> 02:16:15,229
[SPEAKER_05]: Good, cool.

1759
02:16:15,669 --> 02:16:15,989
[SPEAKER_05]: Here it is.

1760
02:16:16,189 --> 02:16:16,529
[SPEAKER_05]: Good, cool.

1761
02:16:27,706 --> 02:16:29,073
[SPEAKER_14]: and beyond which there is so much more.

1762
02:17:14,282 --> 02:17:31,429
I know it's hard to really love someone It takes a long time to trust someone But I don't care how long it will take My love is of so much So be brave and let me show you

1763
02:18:12,422 --> 02:18:22,826
[SPEAKER_22]: Hi, we're back with more Orange Lounge Radio.

1764
02:18:23,947 --> 02:18:31,150
[SPEAKER_05]: That was an okay song, that good, cool, except you could totally tell that that was a key sound rip from the game because, like, the singing sound.

1765
02:18:31,210 --> 02:18:32,270
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty bad.

1766
02:18:36,753 --> 02:18:39,696
[SPEAKER_05]: First Resolution was the name of that song.

1767
02:18:39,716 --> 02:18:43,961
[SPEAKER_05]: 100% Mini Moog was the one that sounded like 60 RadioShack keyboard demos all going over each other.

1768
02:18:44,461 --> 02:18:47,705
[SPEAKER_05]: And Akira Yamaoka, Empty of the Sky, which I kind of like that song, I dig that.

1769
02:18:47,965 --> 02:18:51,369
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're Akira Yamaoka whores here, so we have to play all of his new songs every day.

1770
02:18:52,109 --> 02:18:55,173
[SPEAKER_05]: And then 12th Style, of course, starting that set off, which Loki didn't like.

1771
02:18:55,733 --> 02:18:57,255
[SPEAKER_05]: He just wanted to share that with you guys, he didn't like that one.

1772
02:18:59,397 --> 02:19:03,978
[SPEAKER_05]: Skypline's open because I know we had at least one more personal one to get in, so call in.

1773
02:19:05,339 --> 02:19:21,504
[SPEAKER_05]: During the break there, it was being suggested, and now they're telling me to talk about this, it was being suggested that if Konami were to continue DDR, they should put out, which we really hope they do in the arcades, but they should put out DDR ABBA mix, which would be nothing but ABBA songs.

1774
02:19:21,744 --> 02:19:24,125
[SPEAKER_10]: They already canceled the SMOP mix.

1775
02:19:24,585 --> 02:19:24,965
[SPEAKER_05]: SMOP?

1776
02:19:25,405 --> 02:19:27,886
[SPEAKER_10]: It's basically the Japanese version of Medudo.

1777
02:19:29,039 --> 02:19:29,459
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

1778
02:19:29,739 --> 02:19:33,601
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it was in the works a few years ago and they axed it.

1779
02:19:33,901 --> 02:19:34,601
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what was funny?

1780
02:19:35,601 --> 02:19:37,362
[SPEAKER_05]: You heard all that news about Live 8, right?

1781
02:19:39,063 --> 02:19:40,003
[SPEAKER_05]: I tried to ignore all of it.

1782
02:19:40,143 --> 02:19:44,505
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Dreams Come True played the Japanese Live 8 and that just made me laugh for some reason, I don't know.

1783
02:19:44,525 --> 02:19:47,246
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, oh, Dreams Come True, they're still around, who knew?

1784
02:19:47,546 --> 02:19:48,606
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, you're on Orange Songs Radio.

1785
02:19:49,346 --> 02:19:50,347
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Guy, Siggy here.

1786
02:19:50,447 --> 02:19:51,327
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, Siggy.

1787
02:19:51,387 --> 02:19:52,828
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it's my pronunciation hero.

1788
02:19:52,888 --> 02:19:53,608
[SPEAKER_05]: What's new with you?

1789
02:19:54,702 --> 02:20:00,645
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I'm just gonna, first of all, Sky, it's not Daisuki, it's Daisuke.

1790
02:20:01,225 --> 02:20:02,086
[SPEAKER_05]: I like Daisuki.

1791
02:20:03,467 --> 02:20:05,007
[SPEAKER_15]: Actually, it's not a ke, it is a ki.

1792
02:20:06,028 --> 02:20:07,569
[SPEAKER_10]: It's ke, Daisuke.

1793
02:20:10,350 --> 02:20:13,092
[SPEAKER_10]: There is not a ke sound in a ki spelling.

1794
02:20:13,112 --> 02:20:15,473
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello, it's Japanese.

1795
02:20:15,813 --> 02:20:22,917
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, and the I ones are all i, a, i, u, e, o, ma, mi, mu, me, mo, ta, chi, tu, te, to, right?

1796
02:20:25,101 --> 02:20:29,402
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right!

1797
02:20:29,442 --> 02:20:30,042
[SPEAKER_05]: I see.

1798
02:20:30,783 --> 02:20:31,323
[SPEAKER_05]: So what's on your mind?

1799
02:20:31,343 --> 02:20:32,563
[SPEAKER_05]: What did you call in to talk to us about tonight?

1800
02:20:32,843 --> 02:20:38,265
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I just want to say, you know, I just want to pronounce the songs on Happy Sky Daughter in Japanese.

1801
02:20:38,365 --> 02:20:38,965
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds good.

1802
02:20:40,065 --> 02:20:42,846
[SPEAKER_05]: And what songs are these that you want to share with us?

1803
02:20:43,386 --> 02:20:49,868
[SPEAKER_15]: The artist's name is Chonan Chiharu, and the song title is Rakuen, which means paradise.

1804
02:20:50,128 --> 02:20:50,468
[SPEAKER_15]: Mm-hmm.

1805
02:20:52,273 --> 02:21:03,616
[SPEAKER_15]: And then, well, this one's not really Japanese, but, you know, it's a very hard, you know, pronunciation, very foreign one, which is the Akira Yamaoka song is Ton Pi Pour Trois.

1806
02:21:04,256 --> 02:21:06,297
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, which is kind of more French than anything else.

1807
02:21:06,717 --> 02:21:11,178
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, and thanks to Sakurina, she corrected me on what it means.

1808
02:21:11,218 --> 02:21:12,578
[SPEAKER_15]: It means too bad for you.

1809
02:21:13,899 --> 02:21:14,839
[SPEAKER_05]: Too bad for you.

1810
02:21:14,919 --> 02:21:16,139
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a little bit of that song there.

1811
02:21:16,159 --> 02:21:17,500
[SPEAKER_05]: We played that a little earlier in the show.

1812
02:21:17,540 --> 02:21:17,880
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1813
02:21:17,900 --> 02:21:18,600
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm-hmm.

1814
02:21:19,028 --> 02:21:20,929
[SPEAKER_15]: And then there's by Tomosuke.

1815
02:21:22,090 --> 02:21:24,011
[SPEAKER_15]: The song title is Tizona del Cid.

1816
02:21:24,531 --> 02:21:27,273
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, we have a little bit of that one here too.

1817
02:21:30,434 --> 02:21:31,495
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a little jazzy.

1818
02:21:31,975 --> 02:21:34,157
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on down and play 2DX Happy Sky.

1819
02:21:34,297 --> 02:21:36,718
[SPEAKER_05]: All this can be yours if you put in a quarter.

1820
02:21:37,879 --> 02:21:41,281
[SPEAKER_15]: And then there's Captivate Joker.

1821
02:21:42,962 --> 02:21:45,123
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, we have a little piece of that song.

1822
02:21:45,163 --> 02:21:45,463
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on.

1823
02:21:49,241 --> 02:21:52,262
[SPEAKER_15]: Which is the remix of the 2DX Red ending.

1824
02:21:52,902 --> 02:21:53,542
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.

1825
02:21:53,982 --> 02:21:55,882
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought this sounded a little bit familiar when I first heard it.

1826
02:21:55,902 --> 02:21:56,883
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, where have I heard this before?

1827
02:21:57,203 --> 02:21:57,503
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1828
02:21:58,663 --> 02:22:03,844
[SPEAKER_15]: And then there's the one by Hoshino Kanako is Gekko, which means moonlight.

1829
02:22:06,045 --> 02:22:08,405
[SPEAKER_05]: Which I don't know.

1830
02:22:08,465 --> 02:22:09,005
[SPEAKER_05]: Who did that one?

1831
02:22:10,165 --> 02:22:12,806
[SPEAKER_15]: I think, I believe it was by Hoshino Kanako.

1832
02:22:13,586 --> 02:22:14,846
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if I have that one handy.

1833
02:22:15,747 --> 02:22:17,147
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, but okay, so there's that one.

1834
02:22:18,257 --> 02:22:20,237
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, and then the E-Amusement songs.

1835
02:22:21,058 --> 02:22:22,758
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I don't even know if I have those.

1836
02:22:22,978 --> 02:22:23,238
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah?

1837
02:22:24,238 --> 02:22:25,659
[SPEAKER_15]: Agnus Dei by Asaki.

1838
02:22:26,119 --> 02:22:27,219
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay, I do have that one.

1839
02:22:27,239 --> 02:22:28,639
[SPEAKER_05]: So I do have some of these E-Amuse songs.

1840
02:22:28,679 --> 02:22:28,919
[SPEAKER_05]: Goodie.

1841
02:22:33,020 --> 02:22:40,142
[SPEAKER_15]: Speaking of Asaki, the Guitar Freaks Drum Mania artist, Asaki, is currently working on an album.

1858
02:24:53,399 --> 02:24:54,779
[SPEAKER_05]: It's actually pronounced Dixie.

1859
02:24:56,900 --> 02:25:04,783
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god, but if I were to call it Dixie, I'd think... Which is so not the song.

1860
02:25:06,403 --> 02:25:08,604
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't call it Dixie, I can't, I'm sorry.

1861

[SPEAKER_15]: That's going to have to stay in Japan.

1862
02:25:10,705 --> 02:25:11,825
[SPEAKER_15]: It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter.

1863
02:25:11,845 --> 02:25:12,625

1866
02:25:48,407 --> 02:25:52,305
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a shitload of flashing 12s on doubles, but you know doubles is some scary shit.

1867
02:25:52,345 --> 02:25:53,249
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you play doubles at all?

1868
02:25:54,168 --> 02:25:55,449
[SPEAKER_15]: I've never played doubles.

1869
02:25:55,709 --> 02:25:59,411
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm trying to play on normal when I have another controller.

1870
02:25:59,631 --> 02:26:01,051
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm waiting for it for the US release.

1871
02:26:02,352 --> 02:26:10,376
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what, that's why I've been kind of holding off on playing the 2DX at home lately, because I'm holding off, because my controller sucks balls.

1872
02:26:10,776 --> 02:26:17,739
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm looking forward to being able to get cheap controllers here, because I'm thinking, what, the controllers here are going to cost, what, maybe $39.95?

1873
02:26:17,979 --> 02:26:18,340
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe?

1874
02:26:18,600 --> 02:26:19,660
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, don't quote me on this.

1875
02:26:19,900 --> 02:26:20,541
[SPEAKER_10]: You think more?

1876
02:26:21,221 --> 02:26:23,362
[SPEAKER_10]: I can get confirmation very soon on that.

1877
02:26:23,829 --> 02:26:24,210
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

1878
02:26:24,870 --> 02:26:26,272
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got some hookup I don't know about.

1879
02:26:26,372 --> 02:26:29,676
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that's because they send price lists to GameStop before they put the stuff out.

1880
02:26:29,736 --> 02:26:30,377
[SPEAKER_05]: Find that shit out.

1881
02:26:30,397 --> 02:26:31,057
[SPEAKER_05]: For pre-orders.

1882
02:26:31,458 --> 02:26:31,878
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to know.

1883
02:26:32,499 --> 02:26:32,779
[SPEAKER_10]: Really?

1884
02:26:33,440 --> 02:26:34,902
[SPEAKER_10]: More than $40 for the controller?

1885
02:26:34,942 --> 02:26:35,523
[SPEAKER_10]: I would think so.

1886
02:26:36,183 --> 02:26:36,924
[SPEAKER_10]: Logically, I would think so.

1887
02:26:36,944 --> 02:26:37,385
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope not.

1888
02:26:37,685 --> 02:26:39,988
[SPEAKER_05]: You know some other company is going to put out a cheap one, though.

1889
02:26:40,008 --> 02:26:42,971
[SPEAKER_05]: But, of course, you have to go the regular Konami one because the other ones are going to suck.

1890
02:26:43,868 --> 02:26:46,929
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, wait a second, I'll get the prices of them off Konami Style.

1891
02:26:47,010 --> 02:26:51,072
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there were rumors going around that they were going to improve the controller when they released it here.

1892
02:26:51,092 --> 02:26:52,912
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if that's still true, but that would be nice.

1893
02:26:53,052 --> 02:26:55,013
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to cost a significant amount, I'll put it that way.

1894
02:26:55,514 --> 02:26:55,934
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, damn.

1895
02:26:56,094 --> 02:26:58,775
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, sorry about that, Siggy, we just had to have that little discussion.

1896
02:26:58,795 --> 02:26:59,416
[SPEAKER_05]: That's alright, that's alright.

1897
02:26:59,436 --> 02:27:01,877
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you heard anything about the 2DX controllers being released over here?

1898
02:27:02,757 --> 02:27:04,318
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, no, none so far.

1899
02:27:04,338 --> 02:27:06,739
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I can tell you at E3 they just had the Japanese ones.

1900
02:27:07,059 --> 02:27:11,461
[SPEAKER_05]: I looked, I looked, I wanted to see if it was different, but it was just the regular Japanese ones.

1901
02:27:11,982 --> 02:27:12,542
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I saw.

1902
02:27:13,115 --> 02:27:22,218
[SPEAKER_15]: And from what I've heard, from what I've read on the Japanese forums and message boards, Eden is the continuation of the video doll.

1903
02:27:22,798 --> 02:27:24,198
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what somebody was saying in the chat room earlier.

1904
02:27:24,218 --> 02:27:25,439
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if that was you or somebody else.

1905
02:27:25,659 --> 02:27:29,560
[SPEAKER_05]: I've heard about that, and a lot of the anime fanboys especially really like the doll videos.

1906
02:27:29,580 --> 02:27:29,980
[SPEAKER_05]: That's good.

1907
02:27:31,621 --> 02:27:35,422
[SPEAKER_05]: One of my favorite parts of 2DX is the videos, so I really like hearing when they do...

1908
02:27:36,562 --> 02:27:49,646
[SPEAKER_05]: I just read something interesting.

1909
02:27:49,686 --> 02:27:51,687
[SPEAKER_10]: I think this is a goalie art book.

1910
02:27:52,447 --> 02:27:53,087
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I heard about this.

1911
02:27:53,107 --> 02:27:53,627
[SPEAKER_10]: Konami style.

1912
02:27:53,887 --> 02:27:54,908
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's good.

1913
02:27:55,288 --> 02:27:56,888
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not bringing up any images right now.

1914
02:27:56,908 --> 02:27:58,709
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't that going to be a great coffee table book to have?

1915
02:27:59,229 --> 02:28:02,090
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it'll have to go with my DDR second mixed step book.

1916
02:28:03,670 --> 02:28:03,910
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

1917
02:28:04,251 --> 02:28:05,591
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, anything else on your mind today, Siggy?

1918
02:28:06,495 --> 02:28:07,216
[SPEAKER_15]: One more thing.

1919
02:28:08,537 --> 02:28:19,028
[SPEAKER_15]: The videos for e-amusement songs like Agnes Day and Pink Rose and stuff, they were actually recycled from Guitar Fix Drum Mania.

1920
02:28:20,329 --> 02:28:23,572
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, so the Guitar Fix, okay, that's kind of cool.

1921
02:28:23,792 --> 02:28:30,459
[SPEAKER_15]: And then Pink Rose, I saw the video, and it's like a modified version from the keyboard mania.

1922
02:28:31,084 --> 02:28:32,624
[SPEAKER_15]: That's kind of cool.

1923
02:28:33,285 --> 02:28:33,965
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's kind of neat.

1924
02:28:34,005 --> 02:28:37,566
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I mean, it's okay for them to recycle stuff if, you know, it's good stuff to begin with.

1925
02:28:38,366 --> 02:28:41,567
[SPEAKER_15]: And then for Votum Stellarum, it's an original.

1926
02:28:42,407 --> 02:28:42,787
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, cool.

1927
02:28:43,187 --> 02:28:50,790
[SPEAKER_15]: And then they, whatchamacallit, they gathered all the videos from DJ Taka.

1928
02:28:51,870 --> 02:28:52,050
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh.

1929
02:28:52,970 --> 02:28:55,611
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, they mixed them all in one, and then in the last part...

1930
02:28:57,882 --> 02:29:03,650
[SPEAKER_15]: They just featured the video for V where Tran is walking down the spiral staircase.

1931
02:29:04,951 --> 02:29:08,636
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the last part for Votum Stellarum, the video.

1932
02:29:09,677 --> 02:29:10,679
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, well, I can see that.

1933
02:29:10,699 --> 02:29:11,340
[SPEAKER_05]: That kind of fits.

1934
02:29:12,201 --> 02:29:12,341
[SPEAKER_15]: Hmm.

1935
02:29:13,581 --> 02:29:14,101
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty cool.

1936
02:29:14,502 --> 02:29:18,144
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm hoping that a Happy Sky Machine shows up nearby at some point.

1937
02:29:18,204 --> 02:29:21,046
[SPEAKER_05]: And by nearby, I mean if I have to go to SoCal to play it, then I do.

1938
02:29:22,087 --> 02:29:24,088
[SPEAKER_05]: So I can check this out, because I want to see this.

1939
02:29:24,188 --> 02:29:25,969
[SPEAKER_05]: I still have not played 2DX Red, really.

1940
02:29:26,710 --> 02:29:29,932
[SPEAKER_15]: But we won't be able to see the e-amusement songs, unfortunately.

1941
02:29:31,213 --> 02:29:33,435
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, because that whole hookup is missing here.

1942
02:29:33,495 --> 02:29:33,735
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

1943
02:29:33,755 --> 02:29:35,316
[SPEAKER_05]: It kind of sucks.

1944
02:29:36,296 --> 02:29:36,577
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1945
02:29:37,057 --> 02:29:38,018
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thanks for the call, Siggy.

1946
02:29:38,578 --> 02:29:38,858
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1947
02:29:38,938 --> 02:29:39,759
[SPEAKER_05]: I always appreciate it.

1948
02:29:39,799 --> 02:29:42,661
[SPEAKER_05]: As always, you stay on top of the 2DX stuff more than we do, so we appreciate it.

1949
02:29:43,413 --> 02:29:43,633
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1950
02:29:43,833 --> 02:29:44,633
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, take care, bud.

1951
02:29:45,313 --> 02:29:45,834
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, later.

1952
02:29:45,934 --> 02:29:46,134
[SPEAKER_05]: Later.

1953
02:29:47,354 --> 02:29:51,535
[SPEAKER_05]: Our buddy Siggy there from Vegas calling in to talk about 2DX.

1954
02:29:53,536 --> 02:29:55,656
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course the chat room is yelling, what about ToeJam?

1955
02:29:55,676 --> 02:29:56,496
[SPEAKER_05]: What about ToeJam?

1956
02:29:59,357 --> 02:30:05,518
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, ToeJam being a transplant song from Ultramix 2, which was kind of one of the weird ones there.

1957
02:30:05,719 --> 02:30:07,259
[SPEAKER_05]: ToeJam is also an EMU song.

1958
02:30:07,499 --> 02:30:07,959
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I know that.

1959
02:30:08,019 --> 02:30:08,699
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that's what I meant.

1960
02:30:09,099 --> 02:30:09,419
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.

1961
02:30:11,380 --> 02:30:11,740
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all right.

1962
02:30:12,466 --> 02:30:16,169
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, anyway, I think it's about time to get into the FUs of the week.

1963
02:30:16,209 --> 02:30:19,212
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the part of the show where we get downright angsty.

1964
02:30:20,032 --> 02:30:21,533
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we're mad, we're upset, grr.

1965
02:30:21,974 --> 02:30:27,078
[SPEAKER_05]: So, DarkSakura, why is it that we do... By the way, if you guys have your own FUs, you can send them in right now.

1966
02:30:27,358 --> 02:30:30,501
[SPEAKER_05]: But DarkSakura, why is it that we do these FUs of the week every single week?

1967
02:30:31,822 --> 02:30:32,322
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh...

1968
02:30:42,785 --> 02:30:47,787
[SPEAKER_10]: My first FU goes toward having to sit at family functions with a bunch of people I don't know.

1969
02:30:48,227 --> 02:30:50,647
[SPEAKER_10]: With many people in there.

1970
02:30:51,288 --> 02:30:56,149
[SPEAKER_10]: In the more wealthy part of the area.

1971
02:30:56,689 --> 02:30:57,149
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what?

1972
02:30:57,350 --> 02:30:58,730
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't want to be wealthy.

1973
02:30:58,810 --> 02:31:03,691
[SPEAKER_10]: I would rather be comfortable and happy and be a real person, you know.

1974
02:31:04,012 --> 02:31:04,932
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, they're nice and everything.

1975
02:31:04,952 --> 02:31:05,372
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't get me wrong.

1976
02:31:05,392 --> 02:31:05,892
[SPEAKER_10]: They're nice.

1977
02:31:05,952 --> 02:31:06,692
[SPEAKER_10]: They're great people.

1978
02:31:07,333 --> 02:31:11,774
[SPEAKER_10]: I just don't think that I could stand having to keep up illusions all the time.

1979
02:31:12,953 --> 02:31:14,955
[SPEAKER_10]: if I had a bunch of money, I don't think I would act like it

1980
02:31:26,873 --> 02:31:50,392
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean just in here I know, I know, but we got the air conditioner going, doing the best we can Another FU goes towards my hoid digestion problems That's it, I'm done Oh yeah, this book is, you know, FU to my fiance Freaking finishing a book before me Butthead, I told you to wait Dang, that was quick

1981
02:31:52,140 --> 02:31:55,703
[SPEAKER_10]: I would have read it this fast, I've just had other real life things to do.

1982
02:31:56,904 --> 02:32:03,330
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm reading it right now.

1983
02:32:03,810 --> 02:32:05,292
[SPEAKER_05]: Good participation tonight, by the way.

1984
02:32:05,452 --> 02:32:07,834
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I'm participating and reading.

1985
02:32:07,994 --> 02:32:08,815
[SPEAKER_05]: I am talented.

1986
02:32:08,835 --> 02:32:09,776
[SPEAKER_05]: You're multitasking.

1987
02:32:10,076 --> 02:32:10,917
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, multitasking.

1988
02:32:10,957 --> 02:32:11,417
[SPEAKER_05]: Like a Mac.

1989
02:32:12,198 --> 02:32:14,000
[SPEAKER_05]: Like a Mac, except I'm a lot cooler.

1990
02:32:14,981 --> 02:32:17,183
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's get to Loki's FUs of the week then.

1991
02:32:21,571 --> 02:32:23,153
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a good driver.

1992
02:32:36,547 --> 02:32:40,550
[SPEAKER_06]: Before you start saying that, listen, okay, I said most of the population.

1993
02:32:40,610 --> 02:32:45,394
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless you want to, you know, make noise and put yourself as part of that, you know, percentage, then no.

1994
02:32:45,954 --> 02:32:51,578
[SPEAKER_06]: This is especially appalling because, you know, I'm always wondering why the problem isn't solved around here.

1995
02:32:52,139 --> 02:32:56,482
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, today, on my way over to the studio, there was a cop that pulled out in front of me.

1996
02:32:56,882 --> 02:32:58,924
[SPEAKER_06]: First blew through the red light like nothing.

1997
02:32:59,084 --> 02:33:03,987
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm talking about not stopping under red to make a right-hand turn, just, you know, completely blown through, cutting me off.

1998
02:33:04,628 --> 02:33:06,009
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is fine, it's a cop, you know.

1999
02:33:07,307 --> 02:33:13,548
[SPEAKER_06]: Then she proceeds to get into the right turn lane, to which then she goes straight cutting me off again.

2000
02:33:14,189 --> 02:33:23,491
[SPEAKER_06]: Then she goes and makes another right-hand turn without stopping at all at the stop sign, and flips a bitch right there in the middle of the street, and guess what?

2001
02:33:23,511 --> 02:33:24,971
[SPEAKER_06]: She's on her fucking cell phone.

2002
02:33:25,031 --> 02:33:26,051
[SPEAKER_06]: A goddamn cop!

2003
02:33:26,432 --> 02:33:32,413
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck you, Sacramento PD, and your stupid female cop that was driving down, you know, the road here.

2004
02:33:33,345 --> 02:33:48,572
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, god damn it, you guys are supposed to set an example of what's right, and here she's violating all the traffic laws, going, I'm talking on my cell phone, you know, the hell with you people, no wonder your problem's not getting solved, I'm gonna talk to my congressman, god damn it, and get that stupid cell phone law passed.

2005
02:33:49,993 --> 02:33:51,534
[SPEAKER_06]: Then we'll work on the female driving issue.

2006
02:33:53,615 --> 02:33:53,995
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

2007
02:33:54,355 --> 02:33:58,137
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck you to the fact that my air conditioning's not working in our apartment.

2008
02:33:58,615 --> 02:34:04,080
[SPEAKER_06]: For some reason, I think there's a leak in the Freon hose, because they filled it up about a month ago, and now there's none.

2009
02:34:04,620 --> 02:34:13,008
[SPEAKER_06]: So, that would lead me to believe that either there's some Freon fairy that's stealing the Freon in the middle of the night, or there might be a hole in the hose, okay?

2010
02:34:13,088 --> 02:34:14,309
[SPEAKER_06]: So, well, that sucks.

2011
02:34:14,469 --> 02:34:17,352
[SPEAKER_06]: And, luckily for me, though, I have to babysit the dog.

2012
02:34:17,772 --> 02:34:24,478
[SPEAKER_06]: Which brings me to my next FU, because that stupid dog wants to wake me up three times during the night because it's used to a routine.

2013
02:34:25,288 --> 02:34:29,231
[SPEAKER_06]: That routine being to wake me up three times during the night and piss me off.

2014
02:34:30,712 --> 02:34:31,873
[SPEAKER_06]: Fucking hate that dog.

2015
02:34:32,133 --> 02:34:33,154
[SPEAKER_06]: I gotta do this for a week.

2016
02:34:35,075 --> 02:34:47,585
[SPEAKER_06]: And then finally, fuck you to the people that made the stupid Hanzo the Razor movie because no samurai movie should be about some guy that mutilates his penis to then to have sex with women to interrogate them.

2017
02:34:48,405 --> 02:34:50,807
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not a samurai movie, that's a porno movie.

2018
02:34:51,468 --> 02:34:52,528
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't get too confused.

2019
02:34:54,250 --> 02:34:54,630
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all.

2020
02:35:04,845 --> 02:35:09,608
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to give an F you to the fact that I'm total retard in general.

2021
02:35:10,129 --> 02:35:25,802
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but when it comes to hooking up the Xbox to the new HDTV, because I use the Xbox as a DVD player, because believe it or not, the Xbox actually makes a pretty decent DVD player, but I cannot for the life of me figure out how to get Component and get the really pretty HD picture via the Xbox.

2022
02:35:26,062 --> 02:35:31,046
[SPEAKER_05]: And I went to GameStop and they didn't know, and I went to RadioShack and they didn't know, and I went to Target and, well, shit, they're never any help.

2023
02:35:31,462 --> 02:35:32,623
[SPEAKER_06]: to buy the component cables.

2024
02:35:32,703 --> 02:35:38,588
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, neither of these stores, none of these stores have them for the Xbox, and I'm starting to wonder if they even exist, so I have to do research online later.

2025
02:35:39,348 --> 02:35:40,790
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody in the chatroom needs to help me out.

2026
02:35:40,850 --> 02:35:41,370
[SPEAKER_05]: Got a Best Buy.

2027
02:35:41,911 --> 02:35:44,553
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm thinking Best Buy might have them, so I'll check that out a little later.

2028
02:35:45,193 --> 02:35:46,735
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, so an F you to that.

2029
02:35:46,755 --> 02:35:47,916
[SPEAKER_05]: An F you to Impulse Buying.

2030
02:35:47,936 --> 02:35:49,717
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't believe they don't have them at GameStop.

2031
02:35:49,977 --> 02:35:50,618
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen them there.

2032
02:35:51,018 --> 02:35:53,060
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they didn't have it at this one, so F you to this GameStop.

2033
02:35:53,580 --> 02:35:57,023
[SPEAKER_05]: And an F you to Impulse Buying, because I just bought a multi-hundred dollar TV today.

2034
02:35:57,303 --> 02:35:57,784
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's alright.

2035
02:35:58,544 --> 02:35:59,025
[SPEAKER_05]: I deserved it.

2036
02:36:00,805 --> 02:36:03,826
[SPEAKER_05]: I was a good boy this year, and I deserved a good present.

2037
02:36:04,266 --> 02:36:06,086
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of a late birthday present to myself, really.

2038
02:36:07,967 --> 02:36:10,828
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um... Gosh, I think that's really it.

2039
02:36:11,668 --> 02:36:12,628
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, oh, oh.

2040
02:36:13,549 --> 02:36:18,590
[SPEAKER_05]: F you to the impending nurses strike at UC Davis, because it's going to postpone my dad's surgery again.

2041
02:36:19,110 --> 02:36:20,050
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, for the second time.

2042
02:36:20,390 --> 02:36:23,591
[SPEAKER_05]: And I realize, you know, nurses, they need their rights and everything, too.

2043
02:36:23,651 --> 02:36:26,012
[SPEAKER_05]: So just F you to the timing of the whole thing.

2044
02:36:26,653 --> 02:36:28,535
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, just screwing it all up.

2045
02:36:28,595 --> 02:36:30,196
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially those male nurses.

2046
02:36:32,798 --> 02:36:33,279
[SPEAKER_05]: Stop it.

2047
02:36:35,781 --> 02:36:38,564
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's get to the chatroom FUs, shall we?

2048
02:36:40,785 --> 02:36:52,536
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see... Rini would like to give an FU to my PlayStation 2 for screwing up my speedruns in Katamari Damacy, because the analog feature kept dying on my brand new controller.

2049
02:36:54,195 --> 02:36:57,461
[SPEAKER_05]: Sakura S1N F you to my nephew for being a retard and just being a stupid dumbass

2050
02:37:04,386 --> 02:37:11,569
[SPEAKER_05]: Misty would like to say, fuck the person that broke the subwoofer caging on the Indigroup 2 dedicated cabinet at tea time.

2051
02:37:11,949 --> 02:37:15,150
[SPEAKER_05]: If I ever find out who it was and I actually meet them, there's gonna be hell to pay.

2052
02:37:15,611 --> 02:37:17,791
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially if it's somewhere that's not one of my arcades.

2053
02:37:18,392 --> 02:37:24,414
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope they decide to keep the machine, and one goes to Loki, because as I typed this out, I was thinking he's probably gonna laugh or something when he hears this.

2054
02:37:24,774 --> 02:37:27,215
[SPEAKER_05]: He actually just ran to the bathroom, so he got away with it.

2055
02:37:28,356 --> 02:37:32,157
[SPEAKER_05]: Misty says, also, I want to pass this one along from a friend that doesn't have IRC.

2056
02:37:32,537 --> 02:37:34,038
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck all the Harry Potter spoilers.

2057
02:37:35,475 --> 02:37:37,296
[SPEAKER_10]: Double amen to that, although I've been lucky.

2058
02:37:37,756 --> 02:37:39,096
[SPEAKER_05]: Sakurina is a guy.

2059
02:37:39,156 --> 02:37:45,518
[SPEAKER_05]: Says, F you to myself for eating too much tonight and suffering a stomach ache.

2060
02:37:46,099 --> 02:37:49,780
[SPEAKER_05]: An F you to the heat here, especially since we celebrated Christmas today early.

2061
02:37:50,240 --> 02:37:51,621
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of early.

2062
02:37:54,782 --> 02:37:55,262
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

2063
02:37:55,542 --> 02:37:59,843
[SPEAKER_05]: Jammer J would like to send an F you to roof repairs after hurricanes.

2064
02:38:00,104 --> 02:38:00,364
[SPEAKER_05]: Ouch.

2065
02:38:00,604 --> 02:38:01,264
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry to hear about that.

2066
02:38:02,176 --> 02:38:07,979
[SPEAKER_05]: Reznor says an insane fuck you to Sony for making it so damn hard to become a Jedi in Star Wars Galaxies.

2067
02:38:08,379 --> 02:38:10,320
[SPEAKER_05]: And fuck you to the Mac haters out there.

2068
02:38:10,380 --> 02:38:10,800
[SPEAKER_05]: You hear that?

2069
02:38:11,460 --> 02:38:15,062
[SPEAKER_05]: And fuck you to Logitech for making a shitty joystick that doesn't work worth anything.

2070
02:38:16,923 --> 02:38:19,924
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm so sorry if I fuck up this pronunciation.

2071
02:38:20,144 --> 02:38:27,088
[SPEAKER_05]: Kamui, Kamui, Kamui, 988 says, I say F you to being broke and my laggy as hell Windows computer.

2072
02:38:27,328 --> 02:38:29,849
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, my laggy XP craptacular computer.

2073
02:38:31,354 --> 02:38:32,735
[SPEAKER_05]: Illusion, we have a lot of FU's tonight.

2074
02:38:32,935 --> 02:38:36,398
[SPEAKER_05]: Illusion says, FU to getting a fever this weekend and not being able to go to a party.

2075
02:38:36,518 --> 02:38:37,899
[SPEAKER_05]: It was lame being sick.

2076
02:38:39,140 --> 02:38:41,682
[SPEAKER_05]: GameBoyGuy13 wants to just give an FU to Max.

2077
02:38:44,224 --> 02:38:47,927
[SPEAKER_05]: Ron Chan would like to say, FU to my family for being dipshits all you die already.

2078
02:38:48,147 --> 02:38:55,133
[SPEAKER_05]: FU to my friend Carmen for only showing up in the city every six months and hanging out with her causing me to miss most of Orange Lounge Radio.

2079
02:38:55,533 --> 02:38:56,474
[SPEAKER_05]: Visit more, woman!

2080
02:38:57,295 --> 02:38:58,796
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that Carmen San Diego?

2081
02:38:59,156 --> 02:39:00,017
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I don't think it is.

2082
02:39:01,638 --> 02:39:03,899
[SPEAKER_05]: VidPower would like to say, can F you to lint?

2083
02:39:05,059 --> 02:39:05,539
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree.

2084
02:39:06,099 --> 02:39:06,700
[SPEAKER_05]: Lint is annoying.

2085
02:39:06,940 --> 02:39:08,040
[SPEAKER_05]: Where does lint come from?

2086
02:39:08,080 --> 02:39:08,900
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I want to know.

2087
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:11,021
[SPEAKER_05]: I never really bothered to read on it.

2088
02:39:11,361 --> 02:39:11,961
[SPEAKER_05]: But where?

2089
02:39:14,022 --> 02:39:15,542
[SPEAKER_06]: The lint wasn't on the shirt when I bought it.

2090
02:39:15,643 --> 02:39:19,804
[SPEAKER_06]: You notice how your shirts become a little bit thin and you can start seeing through them?

2091
02:39:20,744 --> 02:39:22,545
[SPEAKER_05]: F you to whoever can't design a shirt right.

2092
02:39:23,165 --> 02:39:29,387
[SPEAKER_05]: Last up, DarkSetsuya says, F you to whatever's causing the voices to be really quiet on Fox.

2093
02:39:30,951 --> 02:39:31,631
[SPEAKER_06]: So guess what?

2094
02:39:33,132 --> 02:39:34,773
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe it's time to stop watching Family Guy.

2095
02:39:34,813 --> 02:39:36,874
[SPEAKER_06]: I ran in there to watch a part of Family Guy.

2096
02:39:37,574 --> 02:39:38,315
[SPEAKER_06]: God damn you!

2097
02:39:38,995 --> 02:39:39,816
[SPEAKER_06]: God damn you!

2098
02:39:41,016 --> 02:39:46,179
[SPEAKER_06]: And they were talking about how Peter is fascinated with the world of never-ending story.

2099
02:39:46,539 --> 02:39:50,541
[SPEAKER_06]: And he was riding Falcor and he was too heavy so Falcor crashed into the ground.

2100
02:39:51,041 --> 02:39:51,762
[SPEAKER_06]: That's hilarious.

2101
02:39:52,202 --> 02:39:55,063
[SPEAKER_05]: Will you stop giving free plugs to the competition?

2102
02:39:55,123 --> 02:39:56,404
[SPEAKER_05]: I love that show!

2103
02:39:56,424 --> 02:39:57,845
[SPEAKER_05]: Family Guy is our competition now.

2104
02:39:57,885 --> 02:39:58,465
[SPEAKER_05]: You must hate it.

2105
02:39:58,925 --> 02:40:00,486
[SPEAKER_06]: I watch every episode.

2106
02:40:01,116 --> 02:40:03,457
[SPEAKER_06]: on repeats on the internet.

2107
02:40:03,597 --> 02:40:04,637
[SPEAKER_05]: On BitTorrent, yeah.

2108
02:40:04,657 --> 02:40:05,137
[SPEAKER_05]: On BitTorrent.

2109
02:40:05,177 --> 02:40:05,658
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fine.

2110
02:40:05,678 --> 02:40:06,378
[SPEAKER_06]: It's TiVo.

2111
02:40:07,238 --> 02:40:08,118
[SPEAKER_06]: I call it TiVo.

2112
02:40:11,459 --> 02:40:11,739
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2113
02:40:12,200 --> 02:40:13,260
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to go to a quick break.

2114
02:40:13,280 --> 02:40:13,920
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a couple songs.

2115
02:40:13,940 --> 02:40:16,601
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we're going to come back and we're going to do some Ask Orange Lounge.

2116
02:40:17,061 --> 02:40:19,142
[SPEAKER_05]: It's your guys' chance to control the show.

2117
02:40:19,182 --> 02:40:20,922
[SPEAKER_05]: And I notice we have a lot of new listeners tonight.

2118
02:40:20,942 --> 02:40:23,063
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm wondering if that's coming from the podcast or what.

2119
02:40:23,543 --> 02:40:26,644
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's your chance to ask us any question you want within reason.

2120
02:40:26,944 --> 02:40:27,545
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep it clean.

2121
02:40:27,585 --> 02:40:28,445
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of which...

2122
02:40:29,065 --> 02:40:30,967
[SPEAKER_06]: Go to podcastawards.com.

2123
02:40:30,987 --> 02:40:35,351
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll notice at the bottom of the page to the right, you'll see the best video game podcast.

2124
02:40:35,391 --> 02:40:36,272
[SPEAKER_06]: And, oh, look in there.

2125
02:40:36,352 --> 02:40:37,553
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Orange Laundry as it goes.

2126
02:40:37,993 --> 02:40:40,355
[SPEAKER_06]: Vote with every single email address that you have.

2127
02:40:40,555 --> 02:40:42,397
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, you know what?

2128
02:40:42,757 --> 02:40:44,999
[SPEAKER_05]: Be careful because I don't want us to get disqualified.

2129
02:40:45,039 --> 02:40:48,623
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you just remember to vote every day, just use one email address is enough.

2130
02:40:48,823 --> 02:40:49,784
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, it really is.

2131
02:40:50,064 --> 02:40:51,165
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't have to worry about the multiple.

2132
02:40:52,947 --> 02:40:53,307
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that okay?

2133
02:40:54,209 --> 02:40:55,710
[SPEAKER_05]: Just get all of your friends to vote too.

2134
02:40:55,910 --> 02:40:56,551
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's it.

2135
02:40:56,791 --> 02:40:57,692
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't have to use multiple.

2136
02:40:57,712 --> 02:41:00,454
[SPEAKER_05]: Just get your friends to vote from their IP addresses.

2137
02:41:00,554 --> 02:41:01,155
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the thing.

2138
02:41:01,515 --> 02:41:02,416
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the key.

2139
02:41:03,256 --> 02:41:04,057
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it's fine.

2140
02:41:04,757 --> 02:41:05,038
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

2141
02:41:07,620 --> 02:41:10,702
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, you should check out our podcast anyway in general because it's really cool.

2142
02:41:10,762 --> 02:41:14,325
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can subscribe on iTunes and it's so easy.

2143
02:41:14,445 --> 02:41:19,349
[SPEAKER_05]: All you have to do is do a search for Orange Lounge and we show up.

2144
02:41:19,409 --> 02:41:19,989
[SPEAKER_05]: Imagine that.

2145
02:41:20,610 --> 02:41:21,871
[SPEAKER_04]: So, listen to us.

2146
02:41:24,341 --> 02:41:24,681
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

2147
02:41:24,942 --> 02:41:25,462
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura?

2148
02:41:25,762 --> 02:41:26,263
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't hear that.

2149
02:41:27,523 --> 02:41:33,188
[SPEAKER_10]: If you do a search for DarkSakura, all one word, on Google Images, the third picture you come up with is my cat.

2150
02:41:35,389 --> 02:41:36,630
[SPEAKER_05]: Do they get any pictures of you?

2151
02:41:36,650 --> 02:41:39,332
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I think our listeners are curious what you look like.

2152
02:41:39,393 --> 02:41:40,894
[SPEAKER_05]: They've been wanting to see your picture for forever.

2153
02:41:42,895 --> 02:41:46,378
[SPEAKER_10]: All they have to do is pull up iTunes and look at our little picture there.

2154
02:41:47,959 --> 02:41:53,023
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see a little teeny tiny 50, or not even 50 by 50, teeny tiny picture.

2155
02:41:53,713 --> 02:41:59,194
[SPEAKER_10]: When I get back from my special break, I will post a picture in the chat room.

2156
02:42:00,755 --> 02:42:01,355
Yay!

2157
02:42:02,235 --> 02:42:02,495
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

2158
02:42:04,876 --> 02:42:05,676
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, we'll be back.

2159
02:42:06,476 --> 02:42:07,937
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to play a song.

2160
02:42:08,377 --> 02:42:10,117
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like, I want to hear something from Red.

2161
02:42:10,137 --> 02:42:12,238
[SPEAKER_05]: Since we've been playing Happy Sky all night, I want to hear some Red.

2162
02:42:12,518 --> 02:42:13,618
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're going to get to Kikak.

2163
02:42:14,658 --> 02:42:15,159
[SPEAKER_05]: Kikak.

2164
02:42:16,139 --> 02:42:16,859
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be back after this.

2165
02:43:03,636 --> 02:43:05,417
Thank you for watching!

2166
02:47:08,234 --> 02:47:08,755
Thanks for watching!

2167
02:48:18,301 --> 02:48:24,108
[SPEAKER_22]: Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

2168
02:48:28,581 --> 02:48:32,364
[SPEAKER_05]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, and it's time to get into some Ask Orange Lounge.

2169
02:48:32,384 --> 02:48:38,209
[SPEAKER_05]: But first, actually, what I wanted to state, this is a response to something that was said in the chat room like an hour ago, but I forgot to respond to it.

2170
02:48:38,709 --> 02:48:45,295
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody was mentioning a Magical Drop 3 tournament, and I was like, oh my god, Magical Drop is like one of my favorite puzzle games ever.

2171
02:48:45,595 --> 02:48:47,136
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, it's right up there with like Meteos.

2172
02:48:47,597 --> 02:48:49,778
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I have that on Neo Geo CD.

2173
02:48:49,899 --> 02:48:51,800
[SPEAKER_05]: I have Magical Drop on my cell phone.

2174
02:48:52,321 --> 02:48:53,321
[SPEAKER_05]: How hardcore is that?

2175
02:48:53,381 --> 02:48:54,542
[SPEAKER_05]: Give me some credit.

2176
02:48:54,662 --> 02:48:55,483
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Magical Drop.

2177
02:48:55,523 --> 02:48:56,384
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, I just wanted to say that.

2178
02:48:57,188 --> 02:48:58,389
[SPEAKER_10]: Too much metal for one hand.

2179
02:48:58,429 --> 02:49:05,035
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get into some... Oh, by the way, in that break we had Kakak from 2DX Red, Everyday Lovely Day, my favorite consumer song.

2180
02:49:05,075 --> 02:49:05,575
[SPEAKER_05]: I love that song.

2181
02:49:06,015 --> 02:49:06,896
[SPEAKER_05]: And Dixie.

2182
02:49:09,158 --> 02:49:10,419
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm sorry, I can't do it without laughing.

2183
02:49:10,459 --> 02:49:11,960
[SPEAKER_05]: DXY, all in that break.

2184
02:49:12,401 --> 02:49:18,245
[SPEAKER_05]: But I knew if we didn't get in some taku that our one and only DarkSakura would be very upset.

2185
02:49:18,265 --> 02:49:22,049
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I would have screamed bloody murder and murdered everybody.

2186
02:49:22,109 --> 02:49:24,391
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a freaking ton of questions tonight in Ask Orange Lounge.

2187
02:49:24,411 --> 02:49:24,911
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you ready for this?

2188
02:49:30,649 --> 02:49:33,551
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.

2189
02:49:34,112 --> 02:49:37,294
[SPEAKER_05]: What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?

2190
02:49:37,854 --> 02:49:43,238
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to admit I'm a little bit scared because there's new people listening tonight and who knows what they might submit.

2191
02:49:43,278 --> 02:49:44,779
[SPEAKER_05]: It might be questions we've heard a thousand times.

2192
02:49:47,581 --> 02:49:48,661
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a different song every time.

2193
02:49:49,142 --> 02:49:51,443
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to make one long compilation of all this.

2194
02:49:51,804 --> 02:49:53,785
[SPEAKER_10]: I am officially halfway through the book.

2195
02:49:55,612 --> 02:49:58,793
[SPEAKER_10]: I like that it has purple text on black on the spine.

2196
02:50:00,773 --> 02:50:05,534
[SPEAKER_05]: Rini is asking about, could you elaborate more on Togo's presence at E3?

2197
02:50:05,594 --> 02:50:07,775
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the first I'm hearing about him being there.

2198
02:50:08,115 --> 02:50:09,135
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Togo was there.

2199
02:50:09,615 --> 02:50:11,356
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why he was there.

2200
02:50:11,456 --> 02:50:14,657
[SPEAKER_05]: I imagine, I think it has something to do with Beatmania being in the US.

2201
02:50:14,757 --> 02:50:16,117
[SPEAKER_05]: I think he might be a part of that.

2202
02:50:16,437 --> 02:50:46,103
[SPEAKER_05]: please don't quote me on that, I think I had heard something about that he's kind of a part of that, which makes sense, because he's been kind of heavy in the Japanese consumer style side, but I did get my picture with him so when I finally stopped being lazy and put up my picture gallery, which maybe I'll do tonight if I can tear myself away from my new HDTV he was there, Sana was not, Akira Yamoko was not there this year, which made me a little sad, so Togo was kind of the token Bomani artist that was there, but he wasn't doing any type of talks or anything like that so, that's all we know

2203
02:50:47,236 --> 02:50:47,556
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura

2204
02:51:13,220 --> 02:51:14,021
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2205
02:51:36,086 --> 02:51:41,073
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to be launching a retro lunch program here on the station very soon.

2206
02:51:41,093 --> 02:51:43,376
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to play the greatest in 8 and 16-bit music.

2207
02:51:43,456 --> 02:51:44,838
[SPEAKER_05]: I have all the 8-bit music done.

2208
02:51:44,898 --> 02:51:47,121
[SPEAKER_05]: I just need to get the 16-bit music done, and then we're ready to go.

2209
02:51:47,502 --> 02:51:49,084
[SPEAKER_05]: So, all right.

2210
02:51:50,806 --> 02:51:51,387
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving on.

2211
02:51:52,566 --> 02:51:57,327
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see, GameBoyGuy13 wanted a clarification on that site where we could vote.

2212
02:51:58,287 --> 02:52:01,088
[SPEAKER_05]: That was PodcastAwards.com.

2213
02:52:01,408 --> 02:52:06,529
[SPEAKER_05]: Although also, if you want to be so kind, PodcastAlley.com has a voting system, A-L-L-E-Y.com.

2214
02:52:07,369 --> 02:52:12,190
[SPEAKER_05]: And the more people that vote for us there, just do a search for Orange Lounge, the higher ranked we are and the more attention we get.

2215
02:52:12,250 --> 02:52:15,671
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, we here at Orange Lounge Radio, we like attention.

2216
02:52:18,370 --> 02:52:19,131
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, let's see.

2217
02:52:19,231 --> 02:52:23,413
[SPEAKER_05]: Socorino wants to know, what do you think the next 2DX style will be called?

2218
02:52:24,213 --> 02:52:28,256
[SPEAKER_05]: Since there is, you know, Happy Sky, 2DX Red, what do you think the next one will be called?

2219
02:52:32,158 --> 02:52:32,618
[SPEAKER_06]: 2DX 13.

2220
02:52:36,900 --> 02:52:37,901
[SPEAKER_06]: Just 13.

2221
02:52:40,082 --> 02:52:40,402
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

2222
02:52:42,544 --> 02:52:43,144
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, let's see.

2223
02:52:44,225 --> 02:52:50,347
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkLionXVI, also known as Siggy, just wanted to point out that I mispronounced K-K-K because I just like saying it that way.

2224
02:52:50,367 --> 02:52:51,447
[SPEAKER_05]: It's actually K-Chak.

2225
02:52:52,187 --> 02:52:52,747
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

2226
02:52:55,488 --> 02:52:58,729
[SPEAKER_05]: JammerJ wants to know... Oh, I'm sorry.

2227
02:52:58,749 --> 02:52:59,549
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a request.

2228
02:52:59,669 --> 02:53:00,149
[SPEAKER_05]: My bad.

2229
02:53:00,669 --> 02:53:01,230
[SPEAKER_05]: Not a question.

2230
02:53:01,530 --> 02:53:01,830
Whoops.

2231
02:53:02,470 --> 02:53:02,530
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh.

2232
02:53:03,446 --> 02:53:07,230
[SPEAKER_05]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2233
02:53:20,663 --> 02:53:21,203
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2234
02:53:52,162 --> 02:53:52,582
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's it.

2235
02:53:52,622 --> 02:53:54,102
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all the questions we've gotten so far.

2236
02:53:55,303 --> 02:53:57,283
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess that's it for Ask Orange Lounge.

2237
02:53:58,784 --> 02:53:59,644
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess so.

2238
02:54:00,004 --> 02:54:02,364
[SPEAKER_05]: We're reading some other things in the chat room there.

2239
02:54:04,105 --> 02:54:04,605
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

2240
02:54:07,606 --> 02:54:09,766
[SPEAKER_05]: 2DX Violet is a suggestion there.

2241
02:54:09,986 --> 02:54:11,186
[SPEAKER_05]: 2DX X2.

2242
02:54:13,907 --> 02:54:16,148
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they're back to talking about Harry Potter, so go figure.

2243
02:54:16,768 --> 02:54:17,628
[SPEAKER_05]: I just, I couldn't.

2244
02:54:18,092 --> 02:54:19,513
[SPEAKER_05]: Get into the Harry Potter books.

2245
02:54:19,593 --> 02:54:20,494
[SPEAKER_05]: I have RDD.

2246
02:54:20,554 --> 02:54:21,835
[SPEAKER_05]: I have Reading Deficit Disorder.

2247
02:54:24,217 --> 02:54:25,558
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't read the big books.

2248
02:54:25,938 --> 02:54:26,599
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why.

2249
02:54:26,739 --> 02:54:27,219
[SPEAKER_05]: I try.

2250
02:54:28,380 --> 02:54:30,582
[SPEAKER_05]: But the weird thing is I used to when I was a kid all the time.

2251
02:54:30,982 --> 02:54:32,323
[SPEAKER_05]: I used to read Judy Blume.

2252
02:54:32,804 --> 02:54:33,544
[SPEAKER_05]: I used to read R.L.

2253
02:54:34,065 --> 02:54:34,605
[SPEAKER_05]: Stine.

2254
02:54:35,005 --> 02:54:36,286
[SPEAKER_05]: The Ramona Quimby books.

2255
02:54:36,446 --> 02:54:37,447
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on, those things were the shit.

2256
02:54:37,607 --> 02:54:38,608
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't roll your eyes at me!

2257
02:54:39,889 --> 02:54:42,011
[SPEAKER_09]: I can roll my eyes at whoever I want to!

2258
02:54:42,191 --> 02:54:43,472
[SPEAKER_05]: Ramona was the shit.

2259
02:54:55,755 --> 02:54:59,357
[SPEAKER_05]: Reznor wants to know, what is your favorite Magical Drop 3 character?

2260
02:55:00,437 --> 02:55:02,999
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, actually, most of the Magical Drop I played was number 2.

2261
02:55:03,179 --> 02:55:04,179
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't really play number 3.

2262
02:55:04,579 --> 02:55:05,440
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't know there was a...

2263
02:55:06,263 --> 02:55:07,043
[SPEAKER_05]: for number three yet.

2264
02:55:07,083 --> 02:55:08,864
[SPEAKER_05]: So I haven't really played much of three, just two.

2265
02:55:09,344 --> 02:55:11,925
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't really know the characters that well.

2266
02:55:11,965 --> 02:55:12,405
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

2267
02:55:12,465 --> 02:55:13,405
[SPEAKER_05]: I just play it.

2268
02:55:16,306 --> 02:55:19,627
[SPEAKER_05]: And Rini wants to know pancakes or waffles?

2269
02:55:21,087 --> 02:55:21,447
[SPEAKER_05]: Waffles.

2270
02:55:22,087 --> 02:55:22,467
[SPEAKER_05]: Waffles.

2271
02:55:22,607 --> 02:55:22,928
[SPEAKER_05]: Neither.

2272
02:55:23,528 --> 02:55:24,408
[SPEAKER_05]: Belgium waffles.

2273
02:55:24,928 --> 02:55:26,188
[SPEAKER_05]: Waffle House waffles.

2274
02:55:26,468 --> 02:55:29,149
[SPEAKER_05]: The peanut butter and banana waffle from the country, what was that?

2275
02:55:29,189 --> 02:55:29,869
[SPEAKER_05]: Country waffles?

2276
02:55:30,270 --> 02:55:31,030
[SPEAKER_05]: Not Waffle House.

2277
02:55:31,110 --> 02:55:32,230
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't have those here.

2278
02:55:32,250 --> 02:55:32,810
[SPEAKER_05]: Country waffles.

2279
02:55:32,870 --> 02:55:33,170
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

2280
02:55:33,490 --> 02:55:35,671
[SPEAKER_05]: That is the banana and peanut butter or the

2281
02:55:36,980 --> 02:55:37,280
[SPEAKER_05]: Love it!

2282
02:55:38,960 --> 02:55:39,221
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

2283
02:55:40,221 --> 02:55:43,802
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

2284
02:55:47,002 --> 02:55:51,143
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for listening and tuning in to us and listening to our show and our rants and our raves.

2285
02:55:51,744 --> 02:55:54,184
[SPEAKER_05]: Now it's time to go around and get everybody's final thought.

2286
02:55:54,824 --> 02:55:55,965
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, your final thought tonight.

2287
02:55:56,765 --> 02:56:00,126
[SPEAKER_06]: My final thought is this week's going to suck.

2288
02:56:01,406 --> 02:56:01,666
[SPEAKER_06]: Why?

2289
02:56:01,686 --> 02:56:01,746
[SPEAKER_06]: Why?

2290
02:56:02,367 --> 02:56:05,130
[SPEAKER_06]: Reject false icons and people stop getting in my way of me reading the book.

2291
02:56:27,229 --> 02:56:30,611
[SPEAKER_05]: My final thought is I'm going to go play with my new television.

2292
02:56:30,631 --> 02:56:32,632
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to go play Xbox really big.

2293
02:56:32,913 --> 02:56:33,273
[SPEAKER_05]: Can't wait.

2294
02:56:33,913 --> 02:56:34,394
[SPEAKER_05]: And 2DX.

2295
02:56:34,494 --> 02:56:35,674
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm still playing 2DX tonight.

2296
02:56:35,914 --> 02:56:37,175
[SPEAKER_08]: I played Guitar Man on mine.

2297
02:56:37,636 --> 02:56:38,056
[SPEAKER_08]: How was that?

2298
02:56:39,637 --> 02:56:41,938
[SPEAKER_08]: 50 inches of Guitar Man goodness.

2299
02:56:42,498 --> 02:56:43,899
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually have a widescreen TV.

2300
02:56:43,979 --> 02:56:47,341
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to set your PlayStation option to the widescreen.

2301
02:56:47,842 --> 02:56:48,382
[SPEAKER_05]: I won't forget.

2302
02:56:48,762 --> 02:56:50,964
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it'll look kind of funky if you just do it on TV.

2303
02:56:51,024 --> 02:56:53,305
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but I'm going to play 2DX widescreen and I'm going to probably...

2304
02:56:55,635 --> 02:56:56,855
[SPEAKER_05]: Spill beer in my pants.

2305
02:56:57,496 --> 02:56:59,596
[SPEAKER_06]: You can also do Ultramix in widescreen.

2306
02:56:59,836 --> 02:57:01,317
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think Ultramix supports HD.

2307
02:57:01,457 --> 02:57:02,077
[SPEAKER_05]: That made me sad.

2308
02:57:02,657 --> 02:57:03,218
[SPEAKER_05]: I looked on the back.

2309
02:57:03,238 --> 02:57:03,858
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't support HD.

2310
02:57:03,878 --> 02:57:11,540
[SPEAKER_10]: But the thing is that for the PS2, you have an option in your menu to change the graphic option.

2311
02:57:11,840 --> 02:57:12,240
[SPEAKER_05]: Can't wait.

2312
02:57:13,161 --> 02:57:13,501
[SPEAKER_05]: Can't wait.

2313
02:57:14,461 --> 02:57:14,761
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2314
02:57:15,782 --> 02:57:17,022
[SPEAKER_05]: Final word of the show.

2315
02:57:17,262 --> 02:57:19,923
[SPEAKER_05]: One word to sum the whole damn thing up for everybody.

2316
02:57:20,464 --> 02:57:22,565
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy episode 150, you guys, by the way.

2317
02:57:23,985 --> 02:57:24,706
[SPEAKER_05]: Congratulations.

2318
02:57:25,226 --> 02:57:25,646
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay.

2319
02:57:25,706 --> 02:57:26,726
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this should be the last one.

2320
02:57:26,926 --> 02:57:27,347
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's finish.

2321
02:57:27,567 --> 02:57:27,887
[SPEAKER_05]: We're done.

2322
02:57:28,007 --> 02:57:28,287
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye.

2323
02:57:29,728 --> 02:57:33,829
[SPEAKER_05]: No, we'll be back next week with episode 151, and then we're going on vacation for a little while.

2324
02:57:35,290 --> 02:57:39,491
[SPEAKER_05]: At least I am, so I think that means we all are, unless one of you guys is going to be doing a show for your house.

2325
02:57:39,551 --> 02:57:39,851
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

2326
02:57:39,931 --> 02:57:40,272
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

2327
02:57:40,532 --> 02:57:41,332
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll talk about that later.

2328
02:57:42,412 --> 02:57:43,793
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe we should do like a...

2329
02:57:44,617 --> 02:57:46,321
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a countdown episode.

2330
02:57:46,581 --> 02:57:47,443
[SPEAKER_05]: Countdown episode?

2331
02:57:47,864 --> 02:57:49,066
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we just get on the air?

2332
02:57:49,247 --> 02:57:50,108
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll work on it.

2333
02:57:50,128 --> 02:57:50,850
[SPEAKER_05]: 5, 4, 3, uh, uh, uh.

2334
02:57:50,870 --> 02:57:50,850
29! 28!

2335
02:57:58,040 --> 02:58:00,742
[SPEAKER_05]: How about when the doors close, you just say go?

2336
02:58:00,962 --> 02:58:01,382
[SPEAKER_05]: Go!

2337
02:58:02,382 --> 02:58:09,206
[SPEAKER_05]: The chat room wants me to remind you all of Channel Oregon Trail, a brand new station.

2338
02:58:09,226 --> 02:58:10,927
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we should start Oregon Trail Radio.

2339
02:58:10,947 --> 02:58:11,427
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think?
