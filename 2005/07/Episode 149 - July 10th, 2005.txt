Thanks for watching!
The following live program is a special presentation of Orange Lounge Radio
Tonight on Orange Lounge Radio, episode 149, the aftermath of Loki's violent, drunken episode last week.
Should be entertaining to get the follow-up on.
Also, be careful, because if you put out there something with four arrows, it is possible that Konami is going to sue you next.
We'll talk about that on tonight's show.
Also, just the randomness you're used to from us.
Isn't that right, Jamie?
All this and a follow-up story if she's sticking around on the Orange Lounge Radio Lesbians for a little bit.
Geeks are hot.
We'll get to that after this introduction.
Orange Lounge Radio is presented in the TMI sound format.
Oh, God.
Call me Daddy.
Orange Lounge may contain adult content.
Orange Lounge may contain any four-letter words.
Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.
Orange Lounge may contain plenty of... Just kidding.
Orange Lounge Radio will not contain any of that in this episode.

Joining me, as always, are my awesome co-hosts in this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm, Miss Jamie Summers, DarkSakura.
I'm not very happy today.
Sorry to hear that.
Didn't you have lots of larves last night, though?
Well, yeah, I split and fell George Carlin.
Awesome.
We'll get the scoop on that during the How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day bit.
Yep.
Okay, well, we'll find out what's bumming you out, too, and if we need to, we'll have to give you a hug.
We'll give you a big hug.
Okay.
Okay.
Also joining us is TechMassaLoki!
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, because our chatroom loves to hear the two songs overlapping each other.
Very nice.
How are you doing, TechMassaLoki?
I'm doing good.
I'm glad to hear that.
How are you feeling?
I'm fine.
How many times did you Ralph after the show was over?
Um...
I don't remember too much, whatever was here, and then that was it.
Alright, we'll get to that a little later.
Also, joining us Elise for a little bit, she's about to go run and get some ice cream, but the official lesbian of Orange Lounge Radio, did we give you a nickname?
Precious Amanda.
Mandarin, or Manders, whatever.
But you have a follow-up to this, don't you?
I'm not a lesbian anymore.
as the straight listeners breathe a sigh of disappointment.
What happened?
Um... She wasn't very nice.
We didn't work out.
She ruined it for everyone.
Pretty much.
Chicks are still hot, but I have a boyfriend and yeah.
I like dick.
Go eat ice cream.
Get off our show.
BabyPandaBorn
Come on baby, let's dream a dream together
A dream that is real
Thanks for watching!
Thank you for watching
Come on, come out
Orange Lounge Radio, Mamani Music, and more.
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 149.
How you guys doing tonight?
Happy Sunday to you guys out there.
I can't believe it's already like mid-July.
Where did this year go?
It seems like it's just, I feel my age slipping away as the days keep flying by.
Is anyone else feeling incredibly old this evening?
Maybe it was just me.
No.
It was just you.
No.
All right.
Hey, Rob.
What?
Rob.
What?
Rob.
What?
Rob.
What?
Rob.
What?
Rob.
What?
Bitch.
So?
Kisses.
First off, I want to thank Loki.
I want to give hearts to Loki because he got me a late birthday present.
He bought me Kirby Canvas Curse, the DS, and you can paint rainbows in that game.
So I'm very excited to go paint me some rainbows.
So that'll be fun.
Thank you, Loki.
As soon as I get paid, I can get your present, but I've been sort of busy moving.
Well, you did give me the seatbelts.
I gave you last year's present.
Those are pretty nifty, except I've kind of been afraid to actually put them in my car because I'm afraid they'll get stolen.
But I'm going to put them in there.
Now that the glass is replaced, I'm going to put them in there.
Because they just replaced my glass yesterday.
I just hope my freaking car doesn't get broken into again, except I will be getting an alarm this week.
I've gotten some leads on some good deals, and I'm very excited.
For those that are not sure where I'm going with this, my car was broken into.
I've lived in this new place where we're doing this show now about, what, about two and a half months?
My car's been broken into twice in that span of time.
I've had two stereos stolen.
The first time, it was funny, because my stereo was actually broken.
So the thieves stole a broken stereo.
Second time, not so funny, because they stole a perfectly fine working stereo and decided to break some glass.
And they screwed up the lock on my car, so I have to climb my big butt over the passenger seat every time I want to get in the car.
That's payback for having a broken stereo the first time they broke into your car.
That's what everybody's telling me.
You were being watched.
I'm not getting any volume here.
No, you're fine.
You sound great.
Just so you guys know, I have headphones now.
I finally replaced my headphones after like a month, so I turned them in studio.
That's probably fair to the rest of us because now I can't hear myself.
Do you want me to turn this up?
A little.
Okay, I thought you didn't like it when I... Well, because you talk like you're screaming into the microphone.
Oh, sorry.
You big old loud mouth.
DarkSakura, has your car been broken into yet in the new neighborhood?
Well, no.
We can leave the door unlocked for weeks and no one will come in.
I know you had the same luck I was having at your old place.
Because the old place I lived in was a big sack of shit.
That's the truth.
Now that you're not living there anymore, do you want to give them a shout out where not to move?
Never live at St.
Tropez apartments on the corner of Garfield and Marconi in Carmichael.
That place is a festering pile of dog crap with worms in it.
Even worse, it's the waste put off by a tapeworm.
And tapeworms eat waste.
Alright, Stalker fans, she doesn't live there anymore, so...
It's waste squared.
It's waste times infinity.
It's super waste.
It's uber poo!
It's waste extreme.
Uh-uh, no, it's uber poo.
And Amiro presents Pump It Up Waste.
Hey, I saw Pump It Up, um, the new Pump It Up in, uh, Vegas, in Reno.
I ended up winning plushies out of the crane games I have one of the donkey dragons from whatever spawn of donkey and dragon from Shrek 2
and one of the donkey dragons.
Cute.
And a Hello Kitty.
Aww.
I love Hello Kitty.
And I got, what else did I get?
I got one more.
Oh yeah, I played, you know those games where you play basketball?
You know, you pay 50 cents and if you hoop you get some type of plushie?
I got a plushie fish.
Cool.
So I beat Julie in the head with it.
Well, just because I felt inspired by our chat room with the slap command.
I told Julie that it was my homage to the radio station.
Your trout command?
Slaps Julie with a large trout Julie's car is the suck going uphill She has to turn off the air conditioner
Oh, it's one of those cars.
She's like, I love my fuel-efficient car.
Fuel-efficient, fuel-efficient.
I like my car that accelerates up hills.
And doesn't lose speed.
And I don't have to turn off the air conditioner.
It may eat gas, but goddammit, my car is fast.
That drive to Reno's a bitch, too.
Alright, anyway, since you're already kind of talking about your weekend, I might as well ask you, how was your week, how was your day, DarkSakura?
It was awesome.
Well, my week was kind of... But the rest of the week was pretty cute.
I saw George Carlin last night, and he was freaking awesome, but all he did was talk about suicide and natural disasters, and how it's cool to watch people die.
I was like, okay, but he was really funny.
But the thing that kind of got me is that he was learning his new material for the 13th HBO special coming up, and he kept reading off paper the whole time.
I was like, that's kind of unprofessional, but hey, he's been doing it for, what, 50 years?
He's entitled, I guess.
I also, you know, we went to the nice places to eat at the Silver Legacy in Reno.
And every freaking thing I ate made me sick.
So I've decided I'm never eating again.
But you were chomping on nuts earlier.
Nuts don't count.
I like to eat nuts.
I bet.
um but no my ways of combating it are basically I'm gonna be fasting for the next three days like eating when I really have to um and uh drinking like this tea that's supposed to every and I think it's just because I think that I've got like a toxic buildup or something and last time I did that I ate a lot of garlic and drank this tea and drank a lot of water and it cleared cleared everything up so hopefully I uh
Don't have any nasty blood poisoning or anything.
Hope not.
I mean, that can be kind of dangerous, but just take care of yourself.
As I said earlier, you might want to consult a doctor.
Yeah, I'm tired of going to the doctor.
My butt's finally healed.
I'm sorry, my hip.
Mostly.
Sounded a little foul there for a minute.
You know what?
What?
I'm going to throw this fair to you.
Jamie's butt?
Rob?
What?
I got the finger.
Alright, anything else you want to share?
No?
Loki, how was your week?
How was your day?
It was good.
I've been working, doing the work stuff.
And... I don't know.
I've just been kind of... We went and met with another rabbi yesterday and found one.
And guess what?
He's an ex-pro wrestler.
What did he wrestle as?
I don't know, but it was a long time ago, like, you know, back in the day, you know, back when professional wrestling was just coming about, not like, you know, WWE type stuff, but like, you know, back, you know, where spandex suits, you know, that type of thing, anyways, so, um, yeah, ex-pro wrestler, that was kind of cool, and, um, then what else, oh, just been, um, I don't know, sticking around the house and stuff,
Playing with my PSP and doing things with the PSP that... Playing with the PSP and doing things with the PSP?
They're borderline illegal, you know, that type of thing.
I see.
I have, right now, I have games on my PSP and stuff.
And a lot of fun stuff like that.
And then I've been playing games on my PlayStation 2.
Like, I picked up...
Killer7, and that's sweet.
How is that?
Well, I guess you can talk about it later on the podcast, but give me a brief rundown.
How is that?
It's psychotic.
That's the best way to describe it.
I'm really curious about that game.
I want to pick that one up.
It plays well.
Everyone's griping about the control scheme on it, but it reminds me of, like, almost like Alone in the Dark, in a sense.
But it's very, very psychotic, and I've only been playing it for, like, I'm only in the second level, and...
It makes little sense, but you sort of get what the story's going on.
Apparently, well, I can't really spoil anything, but based on some of the notes that you get and stuff, it makes you feel like that you yourself are another one of his personalities, the character that you're playing, who has seven different personalities.
And it's just psychotic, and there's a bunch of people that you talk to.
It reminds me also of kind of like a Japanese anime movie or something, because...
There's this severed head that you talk to now and then.
Then there's this guy that helps you who's on some string, looks like a corpse.
There's some other dead guy that you talk to.
A bunch of weird shit like that.
And it's just psychotic.
Just go play it.
It's fun.
Alright, I'm curious about this game.
There's not a whole lot of games that have come out lately.
I found myself very challenged this week trying to find something new.
Because I try to play at least one new game every week for the podcast.
So I have something new to talk about.
But...
There really wasn't a whole lot new for me to get this week, so I had to go get something I would never usually play.
I'll get to that later, though.
Anything else you want to share about your week today?
I've been playing a lot of PSP games.
I've got follow-up questions for you, though.
What happened after last week's show?
I've got to know.
Your family was listening.
How was the next day?
How was the 4th of July for you?
It was fine.
They didn't really bring it up.
It was kind of just funny.
You know, and...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
So for example, in the beginning of the show, I'm like, oh yeah, I'm down four shots.
I was actually down eight shots.
And so by the end of the night, I think I was down 16 shots within about an hour, which is probably why I got sick.
Or 16 or more shots, because I was gone.
And to the point where actually I don't remember parts of the night, so...
I remember most of it.
It's just a lot of it's really fuzzy.
Do you remember just kind of sitting here chilling and then all of a sudden... Yes!
I remember that.
We just got the stains cleaned up today.
It's exciting.
I remember that.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
When the bottle's halfway gone, that's a good clue to stop drinking.
The bottle was pretty much gone by the time I was done.
So, yeah, but, you know, you should have stopped about halfway, and then you wouldn't have had the, you know, blech episode.
Well, I know from now on, and knowing is half the battle.
The more you know, G.I.
Joe.
All right.
So yeah, that's pretty much it.
I was surprised I didn't have a hangover.
Apparently I drank a lot of water here.
I don't remember any of that.
You did.
You drank a lot of water.
I don't remember any of that.
We had to buy a new Brita filter because of you.
No, I'm kidding.
Honestly, I don't remember any of the drinking of water or pictures or whatever.
But I guess I did, so yeah.
Alrighty.
Anything else?
The entire podcast, like I stated on the podcast, I did not remember any of the podcast, so I had to listen to it.
And what did you think when you were listening to it?
I thought it was interesting because I'd say the same thing like three times in a row in all one run-on sentence.
Yeah, which made last week's podcast our longest podcast to date, thank you very much.
It's like, you know, that game completely sucks.
I gotta tell you, that game completely sucks.
And that game completely sucked.
You know what?
That's half the other video game podcasts out there, though.
Honestly, if you listen to their reviews.
Not to knock on the other podcasts, but... But I am.
But I am.
I'm sorry.
Alright.
What?
What?
You were going to say something?
Come on.
Out with it.
I'm going to be nice today.
Please.
Please be mean.
Be vicious.
You are a lame-ass drunk.
BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD
I haven't cancelled my account for Final Fantasy XI or anything.
I can go back to that when I find the disc and install them and stuff.
Do you want your World of Warcraft disc back, by the way?
No, it's okay.
I'll fix that later, too.
I'm also going to plan on picking up Guild Wars this week, too, so yay.
Guild Wars was fun for me for like a week, and then, I don't know, I just kind of, I didn't get it.
I thought it was too much.
Like, whoa.
That mic is screwy, we're going to have to replace it.
I saw Guild Wars in action, and I thought it was okay.
I don't care for the animation style in it.
There's things I really like about Guild Wars, and that is no monthly fee, it's a very pretty looking game, and I like the...
Like, player versus player elements are actually really fun.
So, it's not a bad game.
I just, for some reason, I could not immerse myself in that the way I could Final Fantasy.
I have a PSO.
I'm fine with PSO.
Alrighty.
And I got some DS games this week that I will probably touch on a little bit later.
Okay.
Assuming we get to play it.
But, uh, Meteos.
And, uh, I got to watch a bunch of, like,
Well, stuff that's been around for a while.
We had a trial of EverQuest 2, and so Andrew was trying that out, and I was watching that for a little bit.
It's just, you know, I've been in the game scene, but out of the game scene at the same time, if that makes sense.
I don't know if I should admit this, but I've actually been really curious about EverQuest 2, and I kind of want to try it out.
I think PC Gamer has like a child disc or something anyway.
What, do you want to be fat and lazy?
I mean, come on.
No, no, no.
The funny thing about Andrew trying the 30-day trial, or whatever, the little trial disk was, as soon as he logged in, he looks at me with this, you know, Andrew look, and he's like, hmm, slash pizza?
I'm like, shut up!
It was funny.
Oh, God.
Is that slash pizza thing for real?
I think so.
We didn't try it, though.
I was kind of hoping it was this big urban legend online or something.
No luck.
Alright, my week and my day.
Oh, I'm sorry, is that it?
Yeah, that's it, pretty much.
My week and my day, it was okay.
You know what, since I didn't really have the car to drive around in me, I had a car, but I couldn't really take it anywhere because it was not safe to leave in a parking lot with no window, besides my work parking lot because they have cameras there.
I really didn't do an awful lot.
I just kind of sat on my big butt and, you know... Sniff.
No, actually, a couple of my friends took me places, so I was able to get out of the house at least like once in a while, which is good.
Okay.
Google Earth Keyhole
And now they're giving it away for free.
And basically what it is, it's very similar to Google Maps, how you have the satellite views on Google Maps and it's fun to like try and find your house and stuff.
But imagine that, but like the size of the world.
Like I was traveling to Tokyo and I was looking at the maps of Tokyo and I was looking at Moscow and like all these crazy places, right?
It's a way to like travel the world without leaving your chair.
which I'm sure would be a great marketing slogan for them.
But I find myself fascinated just looking at different places.
I'm like, I wonder what the border to Mexico looks like because I've never been there.
And I'll look along the Mexican border and see if I can see any people.
No, I'm kidding.
The White House is pixeled out.
Yeah, the White House is pixelated out which I think is very interesting.
But it's also that way if I remember right on Google Satellite Maps too.
because they don't want bad people to find it.
Actually, to add to that, the second search Andrew did, he was like, hmm, let's see if I can do troop movements.
I'm like, shut up.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
And I looked at it, and I couldn't tell.
It's either a business complex or it's duplexes type thing.
I don't know.
I know that sounds very stalkerish, but I'm very curious.
As somebody who is part of a startup business ourselves with Orange Lounge Radio and kind of running it out of our apartments...
Our address, though, I can't say the address where we live over the air, but it sounds very corporate.
Like the name of the street sounds like a street that would be downtown.
We have an apartment number.
So I think when people hear it... Well, it's also considering the location of what else is nearby.
True, very true.
I actually live in a very commercial district part of town, so very interesting.
So people might assume, like when they see it on the business card, like, oh, they're in a nice office, not out of some schmo's apartment.
So I was just really curious if that thing was being run out of somebody's apartment or duplex or if it was...
A legit office.
I don't know.
Am I crazy?
Always.
Always crazy.
Oh!
Our chatroom says it is an actual office building.
Sakurina says that.
And there's pictures of it on popnco.com.
See, I should have just done the research and followed the links the old-fashioned way.
That's not fun!
I had to Google Earth it because Google Earth is the new orange.
I don't know.
Google Earth is awesome.
Here's the thing, though.
You can't get it right now from Google's website because they said too many people have tried to download it.
But here's the trick.
Go to download.com and do a search for Google Earth and you can get it that way still.
Ha ha ha.
Fooled you, Google people.
It's so much fun.
I can't explain why it's so great.
It's so fun to just look at different areas and look at places I've traveled to and airports.
It's fun.
But warning, if you live in a rural area...
Your satellite pictures probably aren't very good.
If you don't live within like 50 miles of a major city, it probably is just a big blur, what your house looks like.
Alright, there was that, and I have to give a shout out to this, because it's kind of DDR related.
It's a game that's really, really popular over on the DDR Freak forums.
It's this game they play in random chat called The Wolf Game.
Have you guys ever seen this?
Oh, yes.
The Salem Witch Trials.
I really don't know how to explain it.
It's a forum game, and it's kind of like you're trying to fool people into thinking you're human, but three or four players, depending on the game rules, are assigned to be a wolf, and they're slowly killing off the other players.
And then everybody else gets to lynch one person.
It's kind of crazy.
Go to DDRFreeGranumChat, look for any thread that starts with TWG, and they've got rules posted.
I played my first game, and I lost!
I lost!
I can talk about it now.
I did not get lynched, I was a wolf, and I got hit by the Vigilante.
There was an auxiliary role in the game.
But the Vigilante's a new thing.
It's kind of like, I don't think it existed in the first few games, but the Vigilante basically is a human that can take out any player at any time, and I got wasted, and I was so pissed off, because I didn't even remember that the game had one of those, but, you know, hats off to the guy that did it, because basically he won it.
See, he single-handedly won the game for the human team, so hats off to that guy.
So...
It's a fun game.
I endorse that forum game.
Although it took me like 36 games to finally jump in it.
I thought it was fun.
I don't know.
I just wanted to give a shout out to that because I like cute little forum games like that.
Anyway, let's see.
What else is there?
Oh, I know.
Let's have Orange Launch Radio movie time.
How's that sound?
Yay!
I'm bitter about movies right now because nobody will go see Land of the Dead with me.
Aw, I'm sorry.
I'm sad.
Oh, I want to respond to some comments in the chat room there.
OrangeLoungeRadio.com, click on chat.
And if OrangeLoungeRadio.com is not working for you right now, some people are timing out when they hit it, you can view our chat room the old-fashioned way.
You just have to connect to an other side.
IRC server.
A good one would be what's the one I'm on right now here?
It's irc.introversion.net if you have an IRC client and then join channel Orange Lounge.
So that's the way to do it.
But I did want to respond to some folks in the chat room there.
The Wolf game is an adapted version of another game called Mafia.
Yeah, I forgot to mention that.
So if you've played a game called Mafia, you've played a very similar game.
Also, I think
This game started in live-action form.
Like, it's a popular live-action role-playing game.
A LARP.
It's a fun one-night LARPer, I think.
So, something to think about there.
So you might be more familiar with this game than you think.
So, fun, fun, fun.
Good times.
Would that be that stupid game, Poison, where you're, like, shaking hands and stuff?
I don't know.
I've never played Poison.
There's one person that's, like, the thief or whatever, and they're shaking hands, and after you shake hands with someone that's basically...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
You're on the right track.
Only LARP I ever did was Vampire.
I never played a LARP.
I played D&D in high school, like a couple times.
I wasn't like a total dork, but I had... Hey!
I'm still doing tabletop gaming.
There's not a problem with that.
Hey, dork pride, yo.
I'm playing Buffy.
Buffy TV?
Please, please, come on.
You have to admit, Buffy roleplay is a little bit dorky.
But it's fun.
That's fine.
It's done like a TV episode, it's great.
As somebody who co-hosts an internet radio show dedicated to DDR, that's fine.
Don't make me go grudge on you.
Now I'm having a problem finding that video I wanted to show you guys.
I'm so upset.
What else is new, Rob?
Speaking of... Oh, I found it.
Okay, so we love to do Orange Lounge Radio movie time because it's really funny because we're a radio show.
You guys can't see the movie.
But the audio on this will say it all.
So what we're going to look at is a download that's available on ebombsworld.com.
It's a very popular site.
It's a corporate training video for sexual harassment.
I don't know if you guys have seen this, but it's fucking funny.
I think I know who this is.
It's probably Dave Chappelle.
You hear about sexual harassment on TV, and it makes the headlines in newspapers.
As an employee, what do you need to know about it?
First, sexual harassment is against the law.
And it's against your company's policy.
So what is sexual harassment?
Linda, you are doing a fine job here.
Oh, well, thank you, Steve.
But, you know, you might try dressing a little sexier at work.
I'm sorry?
I mean, we're talking about your job here.
Angel, I want you to dress a little more sexier.
There may be physical harassment.
Wow.
You're really tense today, Nancy.
Ow!
Bill!
Sorry.
Dude, Bill has no sense of hot.
I really don't like it when you do that.
Can you please stop?
Dude, Bill, that's a dude.
I'll never stop you.
I'd be decking him.
Because she looks like she's going to cry.
Bill, that's a dude!
Verbal Christmas is great.
Word around the offices, you've got a fat cock.
Yes, I do.
I've got a fat cock, too.
Maybe we should rub our fat cocks together sometime.
Maybe a little oil.
Two fat cocks.
Together.
Oil.
It might be visual harassment, such as derogatory posters, cartoons, or drawings.
Sexual harassment is not always about sex.
It may be the result of a power struggle between a manager and a subordinate.
Man, I could go for a power fuck right now.
Change is slow, and what was acceptable in time... Here's the best part.
This is the best part of the whole video.
...can now be sexual harassment.
Are you talking about my vagina?
Maybe.
Everyone wants to be treated fairly and with respect.
Are you talking about my vagina?
With the courtesy and respect that you want for yourself.
It's your company's policy and it's the law.
E-bombsworld.com E-b-a-u-m-s-world.com Funniest damn thing I've seen all week, honestly.
That was great.
Seriously.
It's basically what they did.
I think they spliced a real video with those fake clips.
Funny.
Funny stuff.
Love it.
We're going to pass it around at work now.
Are you talking about my vagina?
Maybe.
Thank you, Paul, if you're listening.
Paul's the one who sent that to me.
What a nice guy.
I've seen that one.
All right.
For those of you guys that were good enough to sit through that Orange Lounge Radio movie time, I've got a special treat for you.
We have a new song from We Love Katamari, the Japanese version.
A buddy of mine picked it up and did a rip of the opening song.
So you want to hear what this sounds like?
One of the new songs from We Heart Katamari?
Please.
Here it is.
It's only a minute long.
It's the introduction.
Here it is.
Walkin' with the sunshine Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na Katamari on the swing Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na Katamari on the swing Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na Katamari on the swing Iba hajimaru yo Ibi to boku no Itaike
All right, that was from We Heart Katamari, the new game.
It's good to know that the soundtrack is going to be faithful to the first one.
Although it sounds like they're going to kind of recycle that theme over and over, but hopefully it's only... I heard that it wasn't as good as the first one, but that was one person's opinion.
You know what, though?
But how can you top the first one?
Seriously.
You can't.
You can't.
The sequels are never as good as the original.
Well, the game might.
Games are sometimes the exception to the rule there.
Anyway, let me play just a little clip.
This song is like six and a half minutes long, so I'm not going to subject you to this whole thing.
But you have to hear this.
This sounds like a guy that did a bunch of DDR songs.
It's not.
It's actually a different guy.
But this is a Japanese beatboxer guy, and this is the training music in We Heart Katamari.
I'm only going to play a little clip of this because it's very long.
But here it is.
We Heart Katamari
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
All right, you guys get the idea.
I think that's funny.
That's so cute.
I need that.
So that's the training.
I'll send it to you later.
For those of you guys, we have this poor guy in the chat room that's like, what is Katamari?
What the hell is this?
Very, um, it was kind of a, I guess you'd call it a sleeper hit on the PlayStation 2, Katamari Damacy.
Concept is, you're this little guy, and you have a big ball, and you roll it around, and your ball is sticky, and it just picks everything up.
So you start out, and you're rolling over, like, gumdrops and thumbtacks, and then suddenly you're running over small animals, and, like, then you're running over people, and cars, and cities, and rainbows.
It's beautiful.
Beautiful game.
Um, you can't really call it, like, an underground hit now, because I think...
Tons of people found out about this game.
It's almost mainstream now.
I wanted to say, though, about that Japanese beatboxing.
It totally reminds me, that song there, of something from Bjork's latest album.
This is the whole Bjork album.
I don't know, when I heard that, I was like, I don't know.
Forget it.
Just a word to our listeners.
I posted in the chat room the Japanese Katamari Damashii.
Mina Garaisuki Katamari Damashii is up.
And what does that translate to in English?
Everybody loves Katamari.
Beautiful game, beautiful game.
Alright.
So we'll be looking at that.
Oh, I love this.
Our chat room is going, I have a fat Katamari.
We should rub our Katamaris together sometime.
It smells like Katamari in here.
Is that your Katamari?
Maybe.
Oh, chat room, you're so funny.
You're so funny.
Me laugh long time.
Oh, I actually like the, it's the flashlight.
It's kind of cute.
All right.
Information.
Oh.
It's about time we start talking about that four panel dancing game.
Alright, you want to get into the news?
Fine, we'll get into the news.
Alright, so, if you haven't heard yet...
You might remember when we were talking about this on the show a few weeks ago, because it was huge news.
And that was when Konami first filed the suit against... I keep wanting to say Animero, but that's not true.
It's Rocksword Games against Indigroove.
And most people were saying that it has to do with the fact that what the Boxsword, the system that runs Indigroove, does is it kind of...
Stowe's away in a regular DDR machine.
And Konami was saying that this was infringing on their trademarks and their patents because people would apply the In The Groove stickers, but they'd do a sloppy job of it, so you would still see distinctive parts of a DDR machine underneath.
And it's ruining DDR because In The Groove, according to the lawsuit, you may feel differently, is a subpar game.
And they're saying that, you know, that is...
Basically, their lawsuit is that lazy arcade owners could in effectiveness make people think that this in-the-groove game is like DDR, when in fact the games, while similar in concept to those of us hardcore fans, we know the two games definitely have their distinctive differences.
And a lot of people said this lawsuit is about the arcade only, it's not going to affect the home version, nothing's going to happen.
And I remember sitting here on the show and I said, boys and girls, there is an important part of this lawsuit that addresses something called trade dress issues.
and one of the little things that they were suing on was the trade dress, saying that In The Groove not only was stowing away the machines, but the game itself looked like, felt like, DDR.
But, I don't know, people just seemed to ignore that and they were saying, Arcane only, Arcane only.
Well, sure enough.
An amended version of the lawsuit was filed against Roxxor on July 1st, and now they've included Red Octane as part of their lawsuit.
And they actually have a press release over on their site.
We have it linked from our site over at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
Basically what it's saying is that... Where is it?
Where is it?
Oh, that's the original lawsuit I'm looking at.
I want to look at the new one.
Let's see.
Here we go.
It says, in addition to the prior counts of the original complaint in which Konami seeks an injunction and damages against Rock Source in the Groove arcade dance simulation game, the amended complaint encompasses the recently released home version of Rock Source in the Groove game.
The amended complaint further includes patent infringement complaints against Red Octane, which is the publisher of the home version of In the Groove.
So, very interesting.
Before we get to the second part of this, very interesting because...
You know, this isn't just about the arcade mixes anymore.
This is about, in the group, it's too damn much like DDR.
Basically is what this boils down to, in my opinion.
No!
We haven't seen... Yeah, I know.
No shit, huh?
We haven't seen the specific court documentations yet.
Last time DDR Freak went into the government systems and actually pulled the original files out.
They haven't done that yet for this amendment.
I don't know if it doesn't exist.
You can't find it.
I will hunt for it later on because I think I know where to go.
See if we can find it, but we don't have the exact document, so we haven't been able to read in too much besides what Konami's press release is saying, which of course is one-sided.
But the interesting part about this, they didn't just file against Red Octane.
The sentence I was reading goes on to say they have also complained against MadCatz, which is the publisher of the game MC Groove's Dance Craze.
All these additional accounts are based upon the accused game's infringement of Konami's patent rights in its Dance Dance Revolution arcade game.
Now what's interesting about this, those of you guys that have played the Mad Catz game, or even looked at screenshots and know something about it, know that, yes, it's a dance game, but the differences between the dance craze and DDR...
I think are a little more so than the differences between in the groove and DDR because of the fact that MC Groove's dance craze basically sucks my balls.
I mean, it's an awful game.
Long version songs, steps that don't even go to the beat, they switch the order of the arrows, and they have that gyroscope mode.
I don't know what the hell it was, but it was a piece of crap.
But they're getting sued now too over this, which is very interesting, needless to say.
The crack smoking mode.
What do you guys think about this?
I know you guys had very strong opinions the first time around.
I'm sure this just reinforces those, but I'm curious.
I was waiting for it to happen.
I was really waiting for it to happen.
And I'm pretty much glad it is so far.
Honestly, these people think that just because Konami's sitting on their ass not getting our games out means that they can do it for them.
But hopefully, I have a vague hope that this lights the fire under Konami to...
and so on.
said before, and I'll say it again, that I'm convinced that the reason why this whole thing happened in the first place is because In The Groove crossed that line and decided to invade the home market, which is Konami's turf right now.
So this whole thing, I think we've been working up to this the whole time.
This doesn't surprise me one bit.
And I think even the In The Groove hardcore fanbase, the rabid fanbase, even I think, at least from the reaction I'm reading on DDR Freaks forums,
Even they're starting to say, you know what, yeah, okay, it's no big surprise.
But the big beef that I'm hearing from the In The Groove crowd, and tell me what you guys think about this, is the fact that Konami is not releasing product anymore.
Here's Roxxor attempting to improve upon that product.
Despite how you feel about In The Groove itself, they are attempting to keep it going in the arcade.
They're trying to fill a void and make money at the same time.
I mean, I really think that's it.
I think though, I'm of the school of thought though that while the rock sore corporate group may be in this for the money I think the people that started this whole thing I mean they were DDR fans when they started it I think they had good intentions at heart I think they wanted to keep the arcade's fan base alive and they really wanted to keep this game going because it didn't seem like Konami gave a crap anymore so I think they had the best intentions at heart I just think it's one of those things where
Thank you for watching!
They're not going to make any money in Rockstars Gone Under.
No, I haven't played this MC Dance crazy thing.
But it's like, basically it comes down to this, it boils down to this.
It's very similar to DDR, like pretty much, you know, it's reskinned DDR as you want to call it.
But then again, you have to also go into like, look at the fighting games out there.
I mean, Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat and stuff.
They're not that different.
They're pretty similar.
But I guess they're different enough to where they can't sue each other over that type of stuff.
So what people need to do out there now is if you want to make a music game, feel free to do so, but just make it different enough to where people aren't, you know... I mean, come on.
They weren't even trying within the groove at all to make it any different from... I mean, they were adding stuff to it, whoop-a-dee-doo, and they made the arrows come not quite straight up, but you can change them so they're that way.
And they sort of changed the way the arrows look.
That's not enough.
That's like, you know, taking a Honda Civic out there, painting it a different color, and adding a spoiler to it, and calling it, you know, a Loki's Fast Car, you know, or something like that.
It doesn't work.
It's the same damn thing.
So that's why I think about that.
Angel is someone who I think, I get the impression from you anyway, you respect both games.
You're kind of like me.
I'm not like whoopity-doo over in the groove, but for me it's filling a void that Konami isn't giving us right now with the arcade mixes, and I'm content with it.
It's there.
I play it.
It's cool.
I love the USB support, but I completely understand where Konami's coming from on this.
I think they're just protecting their own shit.
What do you think about this?
No, no, no.
You hit the nail on the head there, and I do...
You know, I do agree with Jamie as far as, you know, I knew it was going to happen.
It was just a matter of when, and it's happened now.
So, you know, we just got to wait to see what happens.
But I do think that Red Octane is still selling it on their site as far as I know, or as far as I've seen.
I don't know.
Yeah, you might want to, seriously, you might want to run out and get this game.
Might want to run out and get it now.
It could be a collector's item or something else, that's for sure.
Yeah, so...
Yeah, so, you know, Rob's right, just pick it up if you haven't picked it up yet, if you think it's, you know, not going to be sold anymore because of the whole, this whole thing.
So, yeah, I mean, I pretty much, I have respect for both games, so I can't really say much, but I knew it was going to happen eventually.
Yeah, I think you're kind of the same school of thought that I am.
Yeah.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Not named in this whole thing, but of course you have to remember, Anamiro and Konami kind of have this history of going back and forth, and they settled, supposedly a long time ago.
So, this is why Anamiro's not being touched.
Which is interesting, because now people are going, how does this affect In The Groove 2?
Honestly, people, I don't know.
And I'm not going to speculate anymore.
I don't know how this is going to affect In The Groove 2, and you know what?
You don't either.
Nobody does.
We'll find out.
A lot of it has to do with how this is going to go.
So, I kind of refuse to speculate anymore on what's going to happen with In The Groove 2 because this whole thing has become such a damn mess that it's hard to say what's going to happen.
Just play the game while you can and hope it's still there tomorrow.
Enjoy it while it lasts.
And if it lasts a long time, great.
I guess that's all I can say on that.
Any other thoughts?
Is this going to make you, Loki, finally run out and get a copy of In The Groove so you can have a home mix of it?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Okay, if you say so.
You guys are awful.
It'll be a collector's item.
I know.
I'll go on eBay.
Are you talking about... I'll make even... I'll write comments in the manual too, you know.
Saying, this game is that way like DDR.
What are you talking about?
Anyway, Loki, Loki, Loki.
Alright, so...
either way, somebody's gonna be pissed off no matter what the result of this thing I mean, even if In The Groove keeps going on the DDR fans will be pissed off and if In The Groove production stops the In The Groove fans will be pissed off do you think, though, that if Konami turns out another arcade mix that it'll appease people?
and maybe they'll go, oh, okay, so Konami was working on something this whole time, now this whole lawsuit makes sense.
Do you think that's going to appease people?
Of course, nothing's going to appease everybody.
They're going to have to, honestly.
They're going to get a lot of pretty outraged mail over this.
They're going to have to do something drastic.
Honestly, they want to keep your fan base.
You know what?
I want to bring up a tip that was brought up
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
You'll at least stay stationary.
Alright, so something to think about.
Alright kids, I think we'll go to a break, we'll come back, and we'll take your calls on this issue if anybody wants to talk to us about it.
Loki, and then some other news.
You know what I'm pissed off about?
What?
The guy game.
They pulled it off the market completely, even the PC version, but now there's a DVD out there with all the nude cutscenes in it.
That's not a surprise.
I thought they pulled this thing months ago.
But my copy that... er, my purchase copy...
and DarkSakura.
In this break, to be fair, we will play some music from In The Groove 2 because we actually haven't played any of the new music from In The Groove 2.
So one of our listeners, Misty, was kind enough to hook me up, so to speak.
So we're going to play three new tracks from In The Groove 2.
We're going to play Energizer, Voresprung, Dirch, Techno, and Summer, the Speedy Mix.
So we're going to play these songs and check it out.
And then we'll be back with your calls in regards to this recent development in the lawsuit world.
We'll be back after this.

A little plug there for our podcast.
Hope you guys are checking that out over at orangeloungeradio.com Now you can get it in iTunes as well.
It's super.
We are becoming Apple-ized.
Yeah, you know, and I'm thinking about buying an Apple laptop, too.
I'm slowly converting to the Mac way.
Don't you even open your damn mouth, Loki.
That's okay.
My next computer, I'm actually going to be building a new PC, but the next one I actually buy pieced is going to be one of the Mac Mini G5s.
Don't worry, I'm not knocking your perspective purchase of a Mac product.
In fact, I was actually thinking of doing my own infomercial for Macintosh and Apple products.
It goes a little something like this.
Do you like stuff that's pretty but does absolutely nothing that Apple is for you?
Because my computer purchases are based on color and not performance.
I like stuff that's smooth and shiny.
Okay, and then they could sell Microsoft Windows.
Hey kids, do you like spyware?
No, I'm sorry, that's Internet Explorer.
You know what?
Do you want to... Hey!
What?
If you work in graphics, video editing, anything that has to do with audio-visual, a Mac is for you.
That was a long time ago.
Not anymore.
I beg to differ.
I beg to differ as well.
After having done my Photoshop homework on a top-line PC and then gone back and doing all my touch-ups on a G5, oh yeah, world of difference.
To answer a question in the chat room, 15-inch PowerBook.
That's why I nicknamed my penis.
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
I didn't hear that.
Okay, I did.
Never mind.
Let's go back to the previous topic we were talking here.
We actually had a question from our chat room during the break here about this whole lawsuit issue.
Dark Knight wanted to know, hey Sky, just a thought.
With this revised lawsuit, what about Guitar Hero?
Since Red Octane is publishing that game, do you think Konami will go after that as well?
No.
No.
I think no.
If Red Octane is still in business after this, which I think they will be, I don't think this is going to set them back too far.
I don't think this is going to affect Guitar Hero at all.
And I think...
Had Red Octane stayed as a third-party peripheral, I don't think Konami would have had a problem with them at all.
But they stepped on the toes.
That's another very interesting thing about this whole lawsuit.
Konami really hasn't been putting out their own pads.
I mean, sure, there's bundle packs, but let's face it.
Most of us are getting our pads from either Red Octane, Mad Catz, or one of those other countless DDR pad companies.
But Mad Catz and Red Octane admittedly being the two biggest companies.
Konami's suing both of them now.
Are they going to say, well, F you, Konami, we're not going to make these pads anymore?
See, they've gone from being, like, protective footwear to being platform shoes that step on the toes of Konami.
Honestly, though, come on now.
Red Octane.
Oh, I did not know that In The Groove was anything like DDR.
No, come on.
They knew what they were getting into when they decided to go ahead and publish these games.
I mean, it's retarded to say otherwise.
And honestly, they're not going to sue them over Guitar Hero because Guitar Hero is different enough from Guitar Freaks to be its own game.
It's more like Amplitude.
Yeah, exactly.
Since Harmonix is developing it, it's all kosher.
Yeah, exactly.
So I'm all for that because it actually looks good.
They're doing stuff to improve the game.
It doesn't try to copy something else.
And of course, our chat room now.
I have a fat lawsuit.
Let's rub our lawsuits together sometime.
Lawsuit?
It sounds like fresh lawsuit in here.
Is that your lawsuit?
Skype line is open, boys and girls.
If you would like to talk to us live, head on over to our chat room, www.orangeloungeradio.com and click on interact with us.
And that laughter there means we've already picked up a call.
So hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who dis?
It's Ron-chan, who you think it is.
Hello, Ron-chan.
Well, see, I can tell by the icon, but the radio bit that we do is we play stupid so that you introduce yourself to our listeners.
That's how it works.
Hello.
Hey, Ok-chan.
Ron-chan.
What is up, dude?
What is up with Konami?
I swear, like they're trying to violate the fan base or something like that.
That's how I honestly feel.
You're a little bit choppy, but I'm going to interpret for those that might have missed it there.
Basically, Ranma's saying that they're violating their fan base with this whole thing.
I agree to an extent that they're pissing a lot of people off with this, but at the same time, don't they have a right to protect what's theirs?
Yes, they do.
It's sort of like they want to be the granddaddy of the dancing games.
Now, here comes a bunch of new guys come along with something, and they're like, oh no, you can't have that.
You must play our game only, not theirs.
Well, but considering they did invent DDR, I mean, you could go back and say, well, there was Dance Aerobics, but BS, DDR is its own thing.
I think they're just kind of protecting what's theirs, and I think what kind of ticks people off is that this is where people get pissed off.
In the groove, probably, I may get yelled at for saying this, but in the groove, probably wouldn't exist if Konami had continued to put out arcade releases.
Agree, disagree?
You're correct.
I agree with you.
So, in a sense, I think where people get pissed off is that they feel like Konami abandoned us.
Even though they've been doing home mixes, let's face it, the reason why the fan base is so large is because we had arcade tournaments and arcade freestyle competitions and all these things going on in the arcade.
We were not doing this stuff in our houses.
We're doing it now because we don't have any other choice, but this whole thing started because of the arcades.
And the home versions, as good as they've been, are not the same thing.
You don't... Remember when we all used to go to Roseville Golf Land on Wednesday nights, back when Roseville Golf Land was cool?
We used to play DDR, we had a good old time.
You can't get that same feeling with a home mix.
And there's people all across the nation, like we are, that did that.
And we're all excited when Max 2 came out, because you had the new songs unlocked.
And Konami, in a sense, abandoned us.
But, okay, now to even further contradict myself or whatever you want to say, at the same time, we were never supposed to have those games in the first place.
Ideally, because they were Japanese mixes.
We weren't supposed to have them in the first place.
But I think Konami was turning a blind eye to the whole thing because it sold home mixes for them.
That's how it all boils down, in my opinion.
Yeah, and they were making money off the import games being sold over here, too.
That's all it was.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Let's look at the reality of this, though.
Let's look at where DDR is at now.
Where is DDR making all the money now?
DDR is making all its money on the home mixes, right?
Konami sends out this press release in January saying, Hey, look how big our dick is.
We sold a million copies of the home versions of DDR today.
We are so freaking rad.
So Konami's bread and butter right now is the home mixes of DDR.
So now here comes this game that's infringing on the home mixes, which we'll refer to as, I can't believe it's not butter.
And now Konami's ticked off.
I think that's just kind of where this all boils down from.
But the percentage of people who are arcade, rabid fandomness is actually, even though consider the DDR Freak has 50,000 members, ITG Freak, not as many.
Like it or not,
I don't know how many members of ITG Freak there are offhand, but let me just say, let's say 10,000.
I know I think I might be overdoing it for him a little bit.
Let's say ITG Freak has 10,000.
10,000 out of a million is still 1%.
Konami can piss off 1% of its fanbase and cut their losses.
Because Extreme 2 and Ultramix 3 stand to be so big that I think things are only going to get better for them.
I don't know.
That's just kind of my perspective on it.
Yeah, and I completely agree with your perspective.
See, personally, I'm not an ITG freak.
I'm not a fanboy.
I like both games.
I have the mixes on both sides, and I enjoy playing them, you know?
Overall, if it wasn't for the fact that the fans were screaming for more DDR, and the groove wouldn't even be here right now.
I just feel that, you're right, Konami did ignore the fans for a while.
Some ass came along to do something.
It just gave them a reason to... Basically, they just woke the sleeping bear.
By the way, I way overshot it.
Just under 2,000 members on ITGFreak.com right now.
Hell no.
Well, shit.
So, I mean, look at that.
One-fifth of a percent, you know?
So, Konami can cut their losses by pissing off the... Assuming every single one of those people are pissed off, which they're not.
I'm a member of ITGFreak.com.
I'm not pissed off.
But I respect in the groove.
I respect what in the groove was built on.
It was guys like us who happen to have a little programming knowledge who wanted... I mean, let's face it.
We all have... Oh, God.
Now I'm, like, going off on this.
We've all expressed...
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,
And that was how they were going to continue on with it.
So I respect where In The Groove came from.
And they wanted to improve on the things they thought needed improving.
And despite the way some of us feel about the game, to these guys, it's an improvement on the game.
The problem is, is it just, I think, got carried away.
And money will do amazing things to people.
And I think there was a little bit... I apologize to anybody on the ITG team that might be offended by this comment, but I think there was a little bit of cockiness there.
On their end, that they were going to get away with this for forever because, and I say that because, on the message boards for the longest time, people would say, how is this legal?
And the response would be, shut up, it is.
And now Konami's calling their bluff.
Alright, now here's my next question, something I said, somebody has mentioned in chat room earlier.
Now that Konami's going after Red Octane and Mad Catz, do you think they'll also go after the creators of Step Mania, even though it's something free to give away?
Technically, they kind of already are if you want to go in the school of thought that In the Groove is based off of Stepmania.
But as for the Stepmania PC itself, I don't think they're going to.
I think because of the fact that Stepmania is open source and they're not making a dime off it, I think it makes it a little harder to get, if you know what I mean.
And I think, again, Stepmania is so underground.
They're not putting Stepmania in stores.
Mm-mm.
so I think for that reason Stepmania has been able to stay under the radar even though most of the rabid fanbase knows about it Stepmania in many senses is still a little bit under the radar when it comes into the whole big corporate scheme of things so I think they've been able to dodge the bullet for a while now and I don't see them suddenly becoming a target but the minute they try to make money off of it I think it will be a target
And you're right, Loki.
It's probably for the best that your machine never did take off, because you'd be in the same boat right now.
Actually, no, it wouldn't matter, because it's one arcade.
It'd be their fault.
But if it took off, etc.
I'm not that dumb.
So, any other thoughts for us, Ranma?
Well, I'll tell you this.
The way this lawsuit's going, if Konami says cease and desist on ITG, those copies are going to be worth a lot of money in the next few weeks.
It's going to be the new Tengen Tetris, is what it is.
Exactly what I was thinking.
All right.
Well, have a good one, Ranma.
Thanks for giving us a call and giving us your opinion.
We appreciate it, okay?
Later!
That reminds me, I'm actually going to be out there for a DDR tournament.
And get this, I haven't been to, it's actually a DDR slash in the group tournament.
And get this, I haven't been to like a DDR tournament since March Madness, like last year.
So it's been a long time.
But I figured since I'm going to be on the East Coast anyway for work-related things, my day job, I might as well go ahead and say hello to the folks at the tournament on the East Coast.
So assuming that this tournament actually happens, because there hasn't been a whole lot of activity on the forums, but I'm planning on it.
It's taking place over at 8 on the break.
and it's happening on August 7th and it's called COTC3 Champions of the Coast is what it's called.
That's happening at 8 on the break on August 7th.
I will be there signing autographs and taking pictures.
No, I'm kidding.
You guys don't care.
But I do want to meet some of our East Coast listeners.
So if you're in the area, stop on by and say hello.
I have an idea for a game.
It's called Hotline.
Hyper Italian Siblings.
It's basically going to be a platform game starring two funny
and air conditioning repairman and they're going to be saving some chick in the fungus land.
Do you think I'm going to get sued by Nintendo for copying Mario Brothers?
Because it's a completely original idea.
I'm just changing the sprites and everything so it looks nothing like Mario but sort of is Mario.
Loki, it's funny you bring that up.
Have you ever heard of a game on the Commodore 64 called The Great Gianna Sisters?
Yeah.
It was basically that.
Except they replaced Mario & Luigi with little spiky haired females and Needless to say Nintendo filed against them and when people compare People always are comparing in the groove and DDR saying it's Street Fighter versus Mortal Kombat right there Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter are both fighting games and in the groove and DDR both dancing games and to me I
When I look at these games, I go, no, it's a little more like Mario and Great Giana Sisters.
You know, Great Giana Sisters had some things that Mario didn't.
Great Giana Sisters has better background music than Mario Bros.
I would go that far to say that.
It may not be as memorable to a lot of people, but Great Giana Sisters has a fantastic background music in it, and just a slightly different gameplay.
So the games were slightly different, but not enough.
I mean, when you played it, you were still like, wow, this is frickin' Mario Bros.
You know what I was watching today?
I was watching on...
was Nickelodeon Gas, their games in Sports Network or whatever.
They had reruns of Finders Keepers, and one of the grand prizes on there was a Nintendo Entertainment System with the Power Pad.
That is awesome
I was going to say it's time to talk about Paris Hilton.
No, no, no.
We'll open the Skype line up for any... We need a new celebrity instead of Paris Hilton.
Lindsay Lohan.
Lindsay Lohan, I agree.
No, no.
How about... That's the point.
We're not going to talk about anybody respectable.
How about Ben Affleck and Jennifer whatever.
They can still call him... Are they back together?
They can still call him Bennifer.
Wait, wait, wait.
Are they back together?
That's the new Jennifer.
Oh.
Not J-Lo.
It's
DeepThought42 DeepThought42 I plugged in my headphones
Wonderful bit of technology that that is.
There you go.
That's what I had to do here.
What's on your mind?
Not much.
I sent Jamie an email earlier this week because I was on GameSpot.com and I read an article which is yet another travesty in the world of GTA.
The politicians are ranting on about GTA, the sex mod.
The hot coffee mod that's going around.
Oh, I heard about that.
I had the article set aside to actually discuss during the podcast tonight.
Oh, okay.
We can touch on it.
We'll get into it in more detail on the podcast.
Does this have to do with, I was reading something about the ESRB.
Their panties are a huge bunch of this.
They're saying that it's violating the integrity of the ESRB.
The thing is, is that the company removed the, you know, it's like when you get a demo out.
My demo of Umjarmalami, for example, has every single stage in it.
It just...
blocks it, reprogram part of the code.
And that's exactly what they did with GTA.
But there are people out there... They would have had to recode the entire game.
It would have pushed it back months.
If they had actually removed it from the game.
It's in the PS2 version.
But instead of pushing it back five months to recode the entire game, they blocked it.
It's not their fault that someone found a way around it.
I give you another example, Bloody War 3.
You remember they had the special photographs hidden in the game, accessible through the debug menu.
That was awesome.
What about the Sims?
I mean, you've got the nude patch for the Sims.
I mean, that's the same thing.
Exactly.
Well, but the new patch was a patch.
It didn't unlock something that was already there.
Same with the hot coffee mod.
It's a patch.
I know.
You know what?
I totally side, and I can't believe I'm siding with Rockstar on something, but I completely side with them on this because if they locked it away and somebody went somewhere they shouldn't have, that's not Rockstar's problem.
And I think the ESRB's issue with this is they're going to look and see if
Were they hiding this?
Were they intentionally hiding this from us when they screwed it?
Yeah, that's the issue.
And I'm going to say no.
That's the issue that they're looking into.
No, they're not that stupid.
It's only in the PC version.
You can't unlock it in the Xbox.
No, you can unlock it in the PS2 version.
Can you?
It's in the PS2 version.
Yeah, you can unlock it.
It's incredibly difficult to do, but you can do it.
Oh, but is it like a button code you put in?
No.
No, no, no.
You have to download something to your memory stick.
I haven't done it.
I'm not really that interested.
Yeah, I know.
Exactly.
The blanks people will go to see some titties in their games.
Please.
Go play some Custer's Revenge, people.
You know what?
Right there you're talking about hacking though.
You're going on the internet and you're talking about violating the license agreement when you open the box and buy the game.
The part of the license agreement says you will not fuck with the game.
And you're violating the license agreement.
So I think Rockstar's base is covered and I think through this whole investigation.
And Rockstar has gone through so much shit in the past couple years by fucking parents ruining this country that damn parents
They're not that stupid.
They wouldn't do something like that intentionally.
They saw the minigame and they were like, you know what?
This is crossing a line that we don't even want to cross.
I agree.
I have to side with Rockstar on this one.
I think after the investigation it will be found out this way.
And the angry parents, the parents who are angry over this, lesson learned.
Watch what your fucking kids download on the internet because that's where they're getting this whole thing in the first place.
I have to say, I told Jamie this, but I do in essence agree.
If you read the article, it's all basically this one guy.
His name is Leland Lee.
He's a California assemblyman.
Those California bastards.
Yeah, I know.
A Democrat from San Francisco.
Damn it.
He has a law in there saying that they do need to overhaul the ESRB.
I do agree with that.
I do think there needs to be a PG-13 rating.
I agree with that, too.
Because you go from Teen, which is like Final Fantasy X, to Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.
That's not...
There needs to be a PG-13, and there needs to be, if you sell an M-rated game to someone under 16, it should be like selling cigarettes to a minor.
It should be the exact same thing.
To an extent, I agree with that.
I think the rules for games should mirror the rules of movies right on down to the rating system.
And as much as an issue as I have with the ratings board sometimes, because they'll give a movie like War of the Worlds, which showed flying bodies.
Oh, that movie sucked.
Yeah, but like flying...
Flying Body Parts and everything, and that movie gets a PG-13, whereas... I like Flying Body Parts.
I know, but still, it should be R-rated.
But you're an adult, and you can enjoy Flying Body Parts whenever you want.
I didn't have a problem with Flying Body Parts.
I liked Flying Body Parts when I was in high school.
Right.
But here's the thing.
Then you take a movie like Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion.
Because they dropped the F-bomb three times in that movie, it gets an R-rating.
There is an inconsistency here.
Exactly.
But...
That problem I have with the MPAA aside, I think the MPAA and the ESRB should work together to be using the same rating system because parents already identify with that PG-13, PGR.
It's already emblazed in their brains.
And so I think they should be just copying that.
It's all going back to singling out video games.
Why are they not going to... Why are they not raging against Rob Zombie's new movie?
Why is it all about video games?
And to me, I think it's... The government is trying to... I mean, not to get all conspiracy theory on you, but I think it's just them trying to say what is art and what is not.
And they're trying to say that if it's not art, then they can ban it.
Am I totally out of... No, I'm with you.
I'm with you to a point here.
I'm with you.
Yeah.
I don't know.
I mean, that's just my... I mean, that may be a little too conspiracy theory, but I mean, between that and the flag-burning amendment and the fact that our president is going to be electing... is going to be appointing not only a Supreme Court justice, but a chief justice, all that stuff scares me right now.
I...
As someone who didn't vote for our president, I can say it kind of scares me too.
We need to march on Washington from this shit.
We need to go to fucking Lafayette Park with a can of caffeine.
A bunch of flags and just be like, fuck you.
Someone has to do something.
I think parents of the world could stand to be educated on this issue a little bit more, but I think to an extent, I think the games should be mirroring the movies a little bit.
Because society, for whatever reason, we have this movie thing emblazoned in our head, but for video games, we treat it differently.
And for some parents, video games are the babysitter.
Yeah.
And it's just different.
I don't know.
And for some parents, television is a babysitter.
Have you ever watched, like, CSI?
Have you ever watched, like...
I mean, just because they don't swear doesn't mean it's not graphic.
I mean, that's disturbing shit.
Me personally, no, I haven't watched CSI, but I have watched other shows that are just as bad.
In fact, I was watching a show the other day that they said shit on it, and I was like, wow.
I mean, I didn't care.
I thought it was funny.
They said shit on Friends.
Did they?
Oh, I missed that.
Yeah, it was one of... I can't believe I know this.
I'm mildly embarrassing myself that I know this, but...
I remember it.
It was one of the episodes where, you know, Rachel and Ross had a little, you know, confrontation and Rachel says, I'm sick of this shit.
Wow, I wonder how that got by censors.
Anyway, DarkSakura, I know you've got to have a comment on this because you're usually pretty passionate about these issues, so I'm curious what you think on this.
It's more of a case of parents being stupid shits and not doing their goddamn job.
Amen.
It comes down to that.
You know, we...
It's very sad that the state that our country has become, where we supposedly have all this freedom, and I actually have to sort of quote George Carlin last night.
We used to be the land of the free.
We used to have all these rights.
Remember when we could do this.
I was like, you know, that's pretty true.
Because now, you know, it's like you and I were discussing previously with my comment about being arrested at protesting.
It doesn't matter if you've got, you know, a license to be there.
If it's anything that's against the current administration, your ass will get locked up.
You know where else they did that?
Good number of countries that were under dictatorship rule, huh?
Yeah, I know.
No, I totally agree with you.
But I keep going back to the South Park movie, Blame Canada.
You know that song?
That's all this crap.
And all the freedoms that we have, all the things are being taken away.
This country was perfect before Nintendo came along.
We've gone from being ultimate right wing to uber leftist and it's all a bunch of bullshit.
I still say we do a Million Gamer March.
We started here.
I say we form our own planet.
I think the Million Gamer March is a freaking brilliant idea.
We just need to organize.
But they're all too busy playing EverQuest.
I'm here, East Coast representation, jersey in the house.
I will, you know.
But knowing the gamer community, we'll try to organize ourselves and then we'll be all, ooh, new Halo.
Too busy, gotta go play games.
We'll be marching with our DSs and PSPs.
Hooray, I'll finally be able to find a PictoChat room.
Ha!
I haven't found one since E3.
All right.
All right, we've got to let you go, but thank you so much for calling in.
This was a good topic.
All right, dude.
All right.
Have a good one, buddy.
Bye.
Bye.
All right.
That was good.
I like that.
Even though that was a more general video gaming issue, you know what?
I think we can do what we want on this program, and we'll talk about that.
That's what we're about.
That's right.
All right.
I need some light in here.
It's getting kind of dark.
All right.
I think we're going to go to a break.
I'm kind of angry.
So I want to hear some Taku because I'm angry.
And when I'm angry, I listen to Taku.
Lots of Taku.
All right.
So we're going to hear some Taku along with some other 2DX songs because after Taku, to offset it, I have a little lovey song.
I have a lovey-dovey song.
All right.
So we'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio and tonight's Cage Match.
More news, etc., etc., etc.
Thanks for watching!
Music Playing...
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
And now, let's listen in to an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting as they debate some of the new programming coming to Orange Lounge Radio.
Jamie, I have a suggestion about some of the music in our Bomani Music and More program.
Can we talk about that?
No subject will ever be taboo.
Well, I was thinking maybe we should move Pump Up the Volume from Tuesday Nights.
Except, of course, a subject that was just under discussion.
Okay, well, what would you think if maybe we cut back on some of the tack music we play on the station?
I collect your fucking head.
Just like this fucker here.
Oh my god, why did you do that to Loki?
The holic thing on episode 69 was just a joke!
Now if any of you sons of bitches got anything else to say, now's the fucking time!
Orange Lounge Radio, where everybody has a say.
You know what?
I really sound a lot like Lucy Liu there.
I'm a really good voice actor.
You're brilliant voice actors.
Chat room is yelling about the speaking of new programming.
There was a post on our community earlier this week that said there was going to be a new show on Friday night.
That was what we call a miscommunication.
A little miscommunication between two parties.
But at least you know that we're working on something.
So we're not just resting on our laurels.
There is new programming being under discussion for Orange Lounge Radio as we speak.
So we will see what occurs.
And there's not just that.
I know of at least three projects being worked on right now.
Just in short, chat room.
Mm-hmm.
Unless it's me or Rob or Loki that posts it.
Question.
Unfortunately, yeah, you've got to kind of go with that rule.
Yeah.
Neither of us post it or it's not listed in there.
Or the website.
Right.
Or we don't confirm it.
Don't.
No.
Not until one of us has confirmed it.
OrangeLawnTrader.com, too.
As much as we love the live journal community, OrangeLawnTrader.com, too, is a great site to get all the latest news.
Yeah.
Hey, Loki, turn off the damn game.
We're doing a show here.
It's not the goddamn game, bastard.
In the groove, the game we've been talking about earlier today with the whole lawsuit business, they're still trucking along.
They have a very interesting thing going on right now, the Worldwide Road Rally 2005.
And if you want more information on this Road Rally 2005, you can visit rocksorgames.com slash roadrally slash, well, I'm looking, it's just rocksorgames.com slash roadrally.
I'm specifically looking at the events page right now.
8 events that they're trying to get people to compete in.
And this is like a nationwide tournament.
I think this is their attempt at doing some type of nationwide tournament.
Listen to the kinds of things they have here.
Most locations played.
And you have to prove this by copying down ITG serial numbers.
Most unique locations, which again I think is serial numbers.
Total distance traveled.
How far did you go to visit locations?
Now see...
I might be able to win this because I'm going to be going to the East Coast on a trip and I might play in the group too out there.
So maybe I should start looking for a team.
Best marathon score, best team photo.
You email them a photo and if they like it, you win.
Best freestyle, best costume, and best overall most hardcore ITG freak.
Is that grammatically correct?
Best overall most hardcore ITG freak?
I don't know.
Regardless, if that interests you, head on over to rockstoregames.com slash roadrally.
Kind of interesting, the idea of a national DDR tournament using pictures or video has been something toyed on for quite some time.
So it's very interesting, I think anyway, that the company who puts out in the groove is endorsing this.
Loki, your thoughts?
I'm sure you have some.
I guess it's a good idea, whatever.
I mean, where are the prizes?
Oh, I didn't even look.
Let's see.
Bad Rob, bad.
Sorry.
For shame.
Trophies.
Overall, most hardcore ITG freak gets two round trip tickets to Las Vegas for the North American tournament finals.
You get tribbles.
Most locations get up to three packages for the winning team.
You basically get like a Megamix CD, a red octane ignition pad, a signed copy of In the Groove, and participation in the lawsuit.
You're bad.
Um...
I'm trying to look at what else they have here.
I don't see a whole lot of... Basically signed copies of In the Groove seem to be the big prizes.
Some other Red Octane goodies thrown in there for good measure as well.
They're nothing to laugh at.
They're kind of neat.
Especially if you're a true ITG freak, then a signed copy of the game should get a rise out of you.
Especially that Las Vegas thing.
That's a pretty good one there.
And trophies!
Who loves trophies?
I drove to play a shitty game and all I got was this stupid trophy.
The trophy has a big dunce cap on it.
Posers!
By the way, I'm being yelled at in the chat room.
This is the worldwide rally, not just the national.
I forgot Canada.
Sorry, because I know we have Canadian listeners.
I forgot.
You're all really close to the border anyway, right?
No, I'm kidding.
It's worldwide.
Do they have ITG machines in Australia?
I think there's one in Australia, one in Europe, so it's worldwide.
If you're in Europe and you're freaking crazy enough to come to the States and play machines so you can win this contest, hey, more power to you.
More power to you.
Who cares?
Honestly, I don't.
Well, I think the whole concept is what's neat, despite how you feel about the game.
The fact that the company is endorsing it and is going to fly people to Las Vegas, that's kind of neat to me.
And they might not be able to when they're broke.
Stop.
After the lawsuit.
Alright.
I'm going to laugh if that happens.
I'm the most hardcore.
I drove all around the country.
Yeah, but we went under.
Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match Sound good?
The way the cage match works, we play three songs for your listening pleasure.
One song selected by each host.
And the winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's
Avani Music and More Program, which plays 24 hours a day, 7 days a week on this station.
We are not live.
Alright, you only get to hear a clip of last week's winner, though, because it already won last week, so you've already heard it.
So last week in the Cage Mash, we had a brand new winner.
Thanks for watching!
Thank you for watching!
Thank you for watching!
Alright, that was a clip of song number one, The Azoic, with Let Me Tell You Something.
And let me tell you something, that song is going for its second win tonight, so we'll see if that'll win, or if one of these two new songs will dethrone The Azoic.
We'll start it off with Loki's pick tonight.
Loki, what did you choose for our lucky listeners?
I chose a song called Wraith, because it's awesome.
And it's also a new MIDI head track, so... Oh, okay.
Goody, goody.
Here we go.
Monolithic with Wraith Monolithic with Wraith
Thanks for watching!
Thank you for watching!
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
Okay, that was song number two, Monolithic, with Wraith.
Let's go around and see if it was good or bad, according to us.
DarkSakura.
It sounds like what I'd... I can't hear myself again.
It sounds like what I would hear at the goth club I go to.
So, in that sense, it's pretty generic, and I still don't really care for his singing.
I like the song overall, but it's pretty generic, so I give it about a seven.
Loki.
It's a 10 because it reminds me a lot of, especially with the end part, a lot of Enigmas type stuff where they have very atmospheric and stuff.
And if this is a good reflection of what the album's going to be like, it'll be really good.
By the way, new album coming out soon.
Bye.
And what... Oh, you gave it to him.
Atmospheric is a very good word to describe that song.
And you know what's interesting is I think that song has me convinced more than anything that Midihead should really try to see if he can't do, like, music scores for video games.
Because I think if he coupled up with the right gaming company, they could do a sweet soundtrack for a game.
Um...
I'd have to second that.
I really do.
I don't know why.
I mean, DDR is one thing, but he really, like, if the rumors are true and he's not into the album making things so much anymore, he really ought to think about doing the video game scoring because I could hear that kind of music in a game like Devil May Cry or something.
I don't know.
I just think it would kick ass.
Or even, like, he does a lot of good instrumental stuff even just for other things.
Oh, yeah.
Like media stuff.
Seriously, gaming companies, look this guy up.
Middyhead.com.
He should score your game.
As for the song itself, Stand Alone...
It's kind of a little too atmospheric to be a standalone song for me.
I think it's the type of song I'd enjoy more on the scope of an album.
So in that sense, if that is the song on the album, I'm looking forward to the album.
But the song itself, I'm not so hot on.
So I'll stop talking and give it a 7.5.
Angel.
I liked it.
It was pretty good.
Midhead's always been a plus in my book as far as music talent and stuff.
So I'll give it an 8.
I put the wrong song in.
I meant to copy what I put in there to a different folder and ended up copying the wrong song.
But hey, it's a good song.
I like that it makes fun of clubs, yet it's played at clubs everywhere.
So it's a blur, girls and boys.
No Bit of Blur!
Alright, I like Blur.
Let's check this out.
Blur with Girls and Boys.
We'll be back after this.
Streets like a jungle, so call the police Following the herd, down to Greece Unharmed at night
Thank you for watching!
Thank you for watching.
See you next time.
Thank you for watching
Looking for girls who are boys, who like boys To be girls who did boys like they girls Who did girls like they boys Always should be someone you really like
Thank you for watching!
Song number three in tonight's cage match, Blur with Girls and Boys, DarkSakura.
What'd you think of that one?
Ten, it's Blur.
How did I guess?
Uh, Loki.
Ah!
Little steppy.
Okay, anyway.
You know, I like the remix of the song a lot.
You know, the remix of the song, I give it ten, but that was just, it felt like something was missing.
It's like a six to me.
That's the original.
How can something be missing from the original?
The remix!
That's what's missing from it, because it sucked.
The remix made it better.
So, it gets a six.
I don't know who you are anymore.
I want Song 2 better.
Alright.
Blur's Song 2 is awesome.
I would, you know, I give the song itself a ten, because I love that song, but I don't know, it's a cage match pick.
I kind of like it when songs I haven't heard...
But I know it was a mistake, so as a song, I give it a 10, but as a cage match pick, I give it an 8.
It's alright.
Angel.
It's blur, it's good, 9.5.
Thank God I didn't get done what I wanted to do.
I have a remix that I thought about doing, that I'm looking at doing, that you're going to be like, when you hear it, you'll be like, what?
Is it, oh, you know what, Jamie's not in the room right now, is it a Gorillaz mix or something?
Is that, uh, something?
No.
Oh, okay.
Imagine, um, it's, just, just, it's in a John Travolta movie.
Oh boy, alright, alright, we'll see.
Is it like the Black Eyed Peas doing Misery Lou or something?
No.
Okay.
Alright, let's recap the three songs you can vote for tonight.
Song number one, The Ezoic, Let Me Tell You Something.
Song number two you can vote for tonight is Monolithic with Wraith.
And song number three you can vote for tonight is Blur with Girls and Boys.
All right.
There's your three songs you can vote for tonight.
Place vote now.
Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.
Hurry, hurry.
And we'll tally them up and let you know who the winner is.
Loki.
Loki.
This is always a part of the show where I ask you, what's going on in the sim scene, if anything?
Nothing.
Well, there was only one thing.
They were doing some new... Well, a couple things, actually, I should mention.
But myself was doing another remix contest.
And the thing now, it's no mash mixes unless they're very good.
And that was their specific instructions there.
I see.
And then also... Hey, I have a great Max 300 mix I want to submit.
Do you think I could win the Balani style contest with this?
I don't know, you know, something like that should be in a dancing game, like in the groove.
Couldn't resist.
That is so awful.
It's like, come on, they didn't even try to make it sound different.
I mean, it's...
And then what the hell was the middle part there that had nothing to do with the whole song?
Because, you know, putting piano stuff in a techno song, that's the hip thing to do.
Look, look, you bashed on the game enough tonight.
You've met your quota.
Go back to the sim.
Fine, anyways, nothing going on in the sim scene, really.
We're still waiting for the Foon Mix 2 stuff to come out.
That's what I'm waiting for.
Hopefully by the end of the summer, because we need another Foon Mix release.
And really, that's all that's kind of going on.
A side note that's kind of interesting, MidiHead, who we've just heard a track from, is going to be doing a podcast coming soon.
I believe the date is the 27th of July, and it's going to feature all of his remix songs that he's done for Dance Dance Revolution, including the stuff that's going to be in Ultramix 3.
So check that out.
If you don't check it out there, we will be replaying it on the show.
Will we now?
I wonder not.
The songs, I definitely want to play that.
He's hoping that Konami gets behind this and starts promoting his podcast on iTunes and that type of thing.
Get the whole company thing going.
I'm still looking to remix some more songs.
I've thought about a few things and the next one I want to do is really strange and I
It's totally different.
I don't even know if it's going to get off the ground.
It's not a Bomani track at all.
And I already told Rob what it was.
I only half heard it, though.
If it is what I thought you said, then I'm, yeah, very interesting.
I don't know.
When I heard the song again, when I was sitting in Mel's, it just sounded to me, I was like, this could be a club track.
It could be.
Someone should have done a remix of this.
But it's very strange.
And I don't know if I can do it justice or even do a remix of it.
So that's why I'm kind of keeping it under wraps for now.
Okay.
Hey, tell me about this DM Ashura thing you were talking to me about earlier.
DM Ashura is doing songs now for O2 Jam.
Yeah, they're still around.
His new song for O2 Jam is going to be Go, and they have a little preview.
There's a thread on their music production forum about it.
So go check it out.
It sounds sort of like techno with a bit of the Japanese tribal stuff in there.
Sort of like Japan or exotic ethnic type stuff.
But it's really good.
So definitely check it out.
The only problem is it's a recording of someone playing it, so it's not completely in sync, but it's good enough.
Get an idea.
But yeah, so that's kind of cool.
Okay.
How many Max remixes put out this week?
You know, I haven't been downloading remixes on Bomani style, but, you know, since we've got, you know, a second here, let's... Actually, I found this sim file and it had a real sweet Max remix in it.
Want to hear it?
Couldn't resist, sorry.
It's just so wrong.
So, so wrong.
But anyways, let's see, this week's Max Remix quota here.
Alright, and your total is... Oh, it's like a telethon, waiting for the big results.
Well, let's see.
There wasn't too much this week, starting with we have The Legend of Max, 300 BPM, whatever that is, Paranoia Climax, Japan Mix.
The Legend of Max Tribute and Max Attack, all of which are re-released.
However, though, in June, there was quite a bit on the week beforehand.
We had Maximizer, Max Naruku Jr., Max Beats, The Legend of Max Part 1, Paranoia, Max Dirty Mix, Legend of Max Mega Mix, Max 300 Mutation, and Rave Max.
Oh, and Love It First Max.
How about my Max brings other boys to the yard?
All right.
You wait.
You wait.
I'm done.
You know what?
Somebody should mix Max 300 and Energizer together.
That would be sweet.
What do you mean?
You wouldn't hear it.
All right.
Let's hear tonight's cage match winner.
Are you kids ready for this?
I guess.
Tonight's cage match winner is a type.
Girls and Boys, People Have Taste, and song number two that is a tie tonight is
He is Zoic with Let Me Tell You Something.
So let me tell you something.
This means Loki's got to break the tie because his song didn't win.
So what do you think, Loki?
Holic.
No.
Which song do I dislike the most?
I don't know.
Zoic is just kind of...
No, I'm going to have to give it to Blur.
Woohoo!
You've redeemed yourself tonight.
Thank you.
Whatever.
You only did that to redeem yourself with Jamie.
Do you realize this is technically the fourth song with Damon singing this one?
Wow.
Alright, there it is.
And you know what's sad?
I just got another vote.
And it would have broken the tie the other way.
But, too late.
You gotta get your votes in on time.
Then we have Max to the Max, Head to Toes 280 Max Survivor, and Max Insanity with Link.
I think we're going to go to a break.
When we come back from this break, of course, the FUs of the week because we are angsty individuals and we are going to spread that angst throughout the world.
And also when we come back, some Ask Orange Lounge if we have a little time.
And you know what?
While you're waiting for us to come back, you can also download such sim files as Max Tampon.
That's lovely.
That's very lovely.
I think we need some Eurobeat in the house.
So we're going to do some Eurobeat.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and the rest of us.
Thank you for watching!
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
Thank you for watching!
From Step Squad to Orange Lab, this PDR sucks!
Holla!
P.S.
T.T.P.O.
Whatever happened to Step Squad?
Are they still doing stuff?
I don't know.
They're supposed to be going to dinner sometime this month.
Oh, that's nice.
That's nice.
Good bunch of kids, that Step Squad.
With the exception of this one girl, DarkSakura.
Okay, fuck you!
I'm just kidding.
Velfia2000, Pandora, Natali from 2DX7Style, Initial D
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I kind of wish Parapara would make a comeback.
Like in the U.S.
Yeah, I know.
They tried to open a Parapara club in L.A.
Did they really?
I think it flopped.
Pioneers releasing the Parapara CDs here.
They need to have a Parapara TV.
I've been buying the anime Parapara CDs.
They should have a Parapara TV show on AZN television.
Have you seen this?
I get AZN TV now.
They rebranded International Channel as AZN.
Now you have a reason to watch TV.
The AZN Network.
You know what?
No, because I caught Fushigi Yugi Dubbed.
I'm sorry, I wanted to pour bleach into my head, shake it around, pour it back out, and then follow it up with Witch Hazel or something.
I saw some pretty funny sitcom on there the other day.
It was some Filipino sitcom, I think it was.
It was cute.
I liked it.
Alright.
DarkSakura, why is it that we have to do these FUs every single week?
Big F you goes to the fucking hurricane.
Because, you know, I was all really, really worried about my family.
And it was just a bunch of crap.
I was getting all sick and, you know.
And then the hurricane, like, hit Sarasota.
So it was like, where I'm glad it didn't hit Mobile.
It's sort of, I feel let down.
In a really, you know, messed up way.
But...
At least, you know, I'm glad my family and all my friends out in the area are doing okay, and I'm sorry for poor, poor Sarasota.
Um, another FU goes to, uh, my digestive system for, I guess, not working anymore.
Because, um, I've been going through just, digestion hurts worse than being hungry right now.
And that's a horrible state for someone to find oneself in.
So I don't think I'm going to eat for a week.
And see if that helps.
Because I was starting to feel better before I came here and actually felt a little hungry.
So I ate a handful of Brazil nuts.
And then drank a liter of water.
And guess what?
I feel sick.
Fun, huh?
And SU goes to...
Buses.
Not buses.
Like 18-wheelers who drive on the left lane on a two-lane street, especially the winding mountain road going to Reno.
Yeah.
Y'all can, you know, drive off into a ravine or something.
Another F you goes to 18-wheelers that try to pass other 18-wheelers.
It's just sort of pointless because they can't really go out that fast anyway.
And that's
All right, Loki.
Um, fuck you to my mouse for the left mouse button to stop working.
It doesn't want to click no more.
I've clicked it way too many times, and now it just, it spryically works.
The other mouse buttons work fine, so I had to buy a new mouse yesterday.
Which put me at Best Buy, and then I had to get in a stupid person line, and...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
You know, I had to feed the paper through five times.
It's just, like, nuts.
Anyways, um... Fuck either of that.
And fuck either the fact that there's no food in my house right now.
At least nothing that I feel like eating.
Because it's all leftovers.
And I have, like, this big thing.
I combined, uh... Some steak with the minestrone.
And so it's this weird minest-steaky.
And, um... Yeah, that's not very good.
And then... My work, um... It's okay.
But, um...
I don't know, I've just, like, been kind of feeling drained lately.
I've been trying to stay up till, like, really late on the weekends, but I've been unable to do that for some reason.
Just feeling really drained, and that sucks.
And fuck you, stupid drivers, because they're always in my way.
And, um... Uh... And the group sucks!
Are you done?
Um, and, um, you know those Macs?
My toaster has better processing power than them.
You're done.
Um, I would like to give an FU to the assholes who broke into my car for the second time, and that's another $100 deductible that I won't be seeing anytime soon, so you can fight me.
Um, I'd also like to give an FU to stress, because I was so stressed out on Friday, like, I got, I got this work thing, like, dropped on me literally at the last minute, and...
On a normal day, that would have been okay, but I was dealing with other stresses that day as well, and I just wanted to die on Friday.
Like, seriously, like, I was so stressed, this doesn't happen to me very often, but I was stressed where, like, I could taste vomit.
Like, I'm gonna barf, I swear I'm gonna barf, although I didn't barf.
But I really wanted to, and that sucks, to go around all day going, I'm gonna barf, no I'm not!
That's how I felt Friday.
So F you to barfing, because that's no fun, nobody likes that.
Except Loki, when he's drunk.
What, Loki?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Alright, that's it for my FUs, by the way.
So let's go on to DDR Angel.
Actually, it's more of an honest FU as far as, uh, you know, the shit that happened in London.
Fuck that.
Don't mess with people's lives.
Hey, I doubly, doubly add to that.
Okay, because I spent all day, even though, like, their, uh, what, our early morning is their lunchtime or whatever, even though I heard about it
and all those people over there and I was just worried about it and I'm glad that he's okay and I'm glad that the rest of my friends in the UK are okay and they're alive.
That's all I gotta say.
I got a text message from my sister in the morning about it because she visited London an awful lot because her ex-husband was from there and while I personally don't know anybody except for some of our listeners that are over in that area, um,
It's just a horrible thing.
It's a horrible thing.
What else can I say?
What else can be said?
It's a horrible thing that shouldn't exist in this world.
Exactly.
You know, some people that I know are saying, like, you know, we should get used to it or whatever because that's what the world's coming to now.
And it's just like, no.
No, no, no.
The whole point is for all of us to stick together and, you know, pretty much war...
The mob's saying, hey, no matter how much you hurt us, we're still gonna stick together.
Yeah, at the same time, I refuse to be terrorized by terrorists.
So I will be continuing to do my function in this world, which is not only my day job, but to spread shit about people I don't like all over the internet.
So you know what?
Fuck you guys, we're gonna catch you and... That's it.
You're done.
And we're gonna go on with our lives and...
Do what we do on a day-to-day basis.
And that's it, I'm done.
Alright, let's get to chatroom FUs.
Misty would like to give a general FU to the stupid people side of work and one to the schedule maker at work because I wish he'd just give me a somewhat set schedule so I could get a second job easier since I have no life outside of work and the internet right now anyway.
DeepThought42 would like to say F you to the fascist douchebags that run our country and the parents who go crying to them every time little Timmy shoots up his physics class because he played Mortal Kombat when he was 12.
Socorina says F you to EA for having some bastard registration system on their PS2 online system that has every name chosen except for stupid names like Pandora... Pandora Noria 2DX?
Pandora Noia 2DX?
Pandora Noia, I get it.
I think that was a way to work in a cheap plug.
What do you guys think?
I think it was.
Doob says, F you, a huge F you to 56k and AOL.
I couldn't hear the show for about three weeks because of it, and I can barely hear it now.
Everything is so slow.
Right now I'm still listening to Heartbeat.
Sad face.
Aw.
Dirty Thief says, F you to Taco Bell for making me fat.
You know what?
You have the choice to either or not.
An MPQ says, F you to Las Vegas.
Thanks for telling me that if you're not 21 and you can't spend hundreds of dollars an hour, you might as well be 5.
Thanks, Vegas.
Thanks for being 90 degrees at night.
Thanks for making it a chore just to go outside.
F you to driving in Oregon.
Attention, Oregon, your speed limits are too low.
Also, you can't pump your own gas there.
I agree.
What the fuck?
Are people too stupid to put the hose in the tank there or something?
F you to driving through the middle of nowhere.
I hope I never see another next exit 10 miles or no services sign again.
I agree.
What's up with that?
Learn how to pump your own gas.
That's what we do.
That was the last F you, anyway.
It's the same thing in New Jersey, I think it is, where you can't pump your own gas.
And somebody told me it's to create jobs.
Okay.
Okay.
Alright, moving right along.
We're going to get into some Ask Orange Lounge in a little while, so please, if you have a question for us, send us a little message over on IRC or our chat room.
Send me a private message if you have a question, something you want to ask us.
I want to give a reminder to folks out there that right now Red Octane is putting together that game Guitar Hero.
Well, they want...
Your contributions, if you happen to be in a rock band, you could be alongside songs made famous by David Bowie, Red Hot Chili Peppers, White Zombies, Ramones, Hendrix.
Hey, we should form a band.
Seriously, we should form a band.
And be really awful.
Send some music.
Send some music.
Since I can't play anything but saxophone and clarinet.
You know what we could do is we could remix Max 300 and send it in.
No.
No.
No.
No.
Triangle Player
We'll give you some maracas.
You can play the gong.
There'll be the samba de amigo maracas.
We'll just wheel out the giant gong, and then at the end, Loki just... That would be hideous.
Yeah, Loki should be... You know what, Loki should... Loki's gonna have to learn how to play drums.
That's what it is.
Loki, you learn how to play drums.
Dude, all the greats have played drums, like Don Henley.
We'll bribe, we'll bribe...
We'll bribe Iguana Girl to be our singer.
Okay.
Alright.
Our band would be awesome.
Even though our band is destined to be in this game, if you want to try and compete against us, you piddly fools, or you have a friend who's in a band who is feeling like competing against us, fools, go to www.beaguitarhero.com and submit your entry.
And you, too, can be a guitar hero.
Alright.
I guess, uh, since there's no questions for Ask Orange Loudhead... Ask us a question, or we will talk about the Lindsay Lohan.
No, we'll go to a quick break.
We're going to do a quick little two-song break.
But I want to talk about Lindsay Lohan.
I want to talk about, well, I have Beatmania on my PSP.
Tell us about this, then.
I have a Game Boy Color emulator called Rin on there, and I found a ROM for Beatmania 2.
and so now I have Beatmania on my PSP.
As well as DDR, but I took DDR off there because that was annoying.
I found that DDR2 for the Game Boy Color had all the solo songs in it, though.
In their 8, or whatever, yeah, 8-bit glory.
But Hot Limit's in there.
I gotta pull up Hot Limit.
That'd be funny.
We'll play that.
Alright.
This is probably going to make my heart hurt or something.
If I wind up in the hospital because of hearing this song and I die there, I'm going to haunt you.
Just thought I'd let you know.
Do you think Lindsay Lohan looks better with red hair or her new blonde hair?
I think the red hair looks better.
I don't care.
I think, though, she needs to eat something.
Yes, she needs to eat something.
Did you hear about that website, EatLindsay, or FreeLindsay or something?
What?
What is it?
EatSomethingLindsayOrSomething.com, or it's a petition going around trying to... It smells like fresh Lindsay in here.
Yeah.
Is that your Lindsay?
Maybe.
Are you talking about my Lindsay?
Maybe.
Alright, we're starting to get some questions for Ask Orange Lounge, so I guess we should go into that segment.
Should we?
Yes?
Do you got that song for us yet, Loki?
I'm working on it.
Alright, here we go.
We'll go into Ask Orange Lounge first.
This sounds like a Mega Man game or something.
This is not Hot Limit.
Oh, here we go.
Cheer, cheer.
Wow.
Interesting.
Alright, let's get to the questions.
Enough of that.
FeedLindsay.com was the site.
Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.
Well, will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?
Is Lindsay better as a redhead, or is she a buxom blonde?
I don't know.
You tell me.
But secretly, I think she's not fat.
I have boobies on my PSP.
I hate having to improvise that song every week.
First question from Socorina.
Can you not talk about Lindsay Lohan?
Oh my god, did you hear what she did last week?
This is so awesome.
But come on, I saw Herbie the... No, forget it, I'm not even going to try.
MPQ wants to know, why does nobody ask questions?
I think the reason nobody asks questions is because we do this almost every other week, and we really need a new bit.
But we're just not feeling creative, honestly.
Maybe for episode 150, which is next week, by the way.
We'll have something new and fresh for you guys.
But until then, it's the same old stale shit you know and love.
The set fire to ferrets segment kind of got turned down.
Yeah, DarkSakura didn't like that idea, and neither did my landlord.
What can I say?
The ferrets are awesome, and they're full of love and stuffing and beasing.
I should point out, though, you should check out the album art on our podcast right now because it's Orange Lounge Radio and then it has little pictures, little little pictures of each of us and then the ferret in the bottom corner because there were four corners.
That'd be four pictures.
Whoa, there's pictures of us online?
They're little little bitty pictures.
Hold on, let me show you.
I'll show you what it looks like.
I have not seen this.
Yes, you have.
I showed this to you last week.
It's on our website, right?
I haven't seen this, actually.
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
Let me bring it up.
Now you're making me work.
You better work!
No, I haven't seen this because I was trying to come up with something and I didn't.
Orange Lime.
Oh, sorry.
I had to bring it in the pocket.
There it is.
See?
I like that.
See?
Me, DarkSakura, Loki, Ferret.
What's that on?
That's our album art for our podcast.
Oh, really?
Yeah.
That's great.
That's the icon that I made.
Yeah, that's the old-ass icon you made and then I did the border around it.
So we kind of co-made it.
That's fun.
That's cool.
And the ferret is our official fourth co-host.
Yes.
She says the same thing every time, though.
No, we should totally get a sponsorship from Scoozy.
We totally should.
We pimp those ferrets like nothing else.
God, we really do.
Ron Chan wants to know, can I be the band manager and book y'all at the Apollo Theater?
Fuck yeah, bring it on.
Oh, fuck no, we'd get booed off at the Apollo.
You know what?
Spelling Bee at the Apollo!
Asphyxiation!
A-S-F-I-X-O-N!
No.
Actually, I have heard somebody try to spell asphyxiation that way, but it was just sad.
MPQ is making an interesting suggestion.
He says, and this is actually live in the chat room at OrangeLunchRadio.com.
Click on chat.
He didn't send this over private message, but he says, Let's play the wolf game next week in the chat and radioize it.
You know what?
I'm not against the idea of doing some type of broadcasted The Wolf game, but I don't know how that would work with the chat.
We'd have to have live people.
Could be interesting, though.
Could be very interesting.
I'd have to think about the... What do you call that?
Schematics?
The way it would work.
Let me think about it.
MPQ, if you have an idea on how we could do that and actually have it be good radio, send me an email.
We'll talk.
Might be fun.
I'm liking this.
I'm liking this.
All right.
We have no more questions, you guys.
You know what?
What?
We need to have questions.
No, this is what we do.
Usually when we get no questions is that we can ask each other questions.
Rob, why are you so fabulous?
Because I am a diva.
Hey, Rob.
What?
Why am I so famous?
Because you're a diva.
Because I'm a diva.
Angel, you haven't been here in a month.
Where the heck have you been?
Where have you been, young lady?
Um, I don't know, gone?
That doesn't answer the question!
Gone is not a location!
Gone is a state of being!
Just haven't been able to show up, I guess.
Uh, yeah, anyway.
She's been invisible.
Unfortunately.
Domo-kun ate her boobs.
That's what's going on.
Ah!
I got wrist slapped for that one.
Alright.
See, now the chatroom's starting to like that idea.
We'll have to figure that one out.
Alright, we're going to go to a quickie break here, and then when we come back from this break, we're going to come back and wrap it all up.
Tell you guys what you can look forward to next week on episode 150.
So we'll be back after this, featuring, since you guys didn't send us questions, and I'm not pleased, you're being subjected to SmileDK this break.
Enjoy.
We'll be back after this.
I thought a little bit of you today Look how I felt without myself for you Look a little bit at me today You know you gotta try a little harder So you can be my mama, my darling Smile, a little smile, let's enjoy the moment
Try it, baby, good, just a little bit of lovin' Gonna feel so fine Is it really true that you feel the same way too?
And hope we'll be together Now you know that I love you Love you, love you, love you, love you Love you, love you, love you, love you, love you When I'm feeling, thinking of A funny word we call love Still don't think of you at first
My family still comes above If you wanna capture me It's as simple as can be Mr. Leonard said it, all you need is Mr. Leonard said it, all you need is Mr. Leonard said it, all you need is Love, my love, my love, my love, my love My love, my love, my love, my love, my love
DarkSakura
Thank you for watching!
We're back here on Orange Lounge Radio, coming here to wrap it all up.
You know when I get bored, though, is I start looking through popular DDR forums to see what the kids are talking about.
Why is it that on DDR forums there is always this kind of topic, at least on DDR Freak and some of the other big ones, there's always this kind of topic within the first three pages of a forum.
Have you ever met your boyfriend or girlfriend through DDR?
I don't know, how about it guys, have you ever met your boyfriend or girlfriend through DDR?
That's such a freaking old topic, it keeps popping up on every incarnation of DDR Freak, and honestly, as a moderator, I'm already seeing it!
Fuck you people, stop posting inane crap!
Why can't we have intelligent conversation?
Like... Well, some people did meet their boyfriend or girlfriend through DDR, which I think is... But this is an old thread.
Yeah, I did, but what business of it is yours?
Well, that is the first time I've ever heard Angel say something snide.
It's great.
You're learning!
Like I were corrupting you!
I'm with Andrew!
Oh, did I say that out loud?
Oh, that was beautiful.
Save that one for the archives.
Angel Gets Mean, episode 149.
Finally, after how many episodes?
Maybe it's sitting next to Loki lately.
He's starting to rub off on you or something.
Either that or it's, I don't know, all of our randomness rubbing off on me.
Maybe people post this topic because they...
They're sad because they want to meet a girl through DDR.
They're sad and lonely and they want to meet a girl with similar interests as them.
Here's the hint.
I want to meet a girl with similar interests as you.
Go outside and participate in those interests that you have.
Because if you want to find a girl that plays DDR, you know where you're likely to find that girl that plays DDR.
I don't know.
Out playing DDR somewhere.
Food for thought.
So my advice, if you're lonely and sad and single and you want to meet somebody, and you know what, I'm a lonely, sad, single guy, but I try.
I go out and do things I enjoy because that is where I'm likely to meet people who have similar interests that I have.
So I suggest you all do the same.
Of course, now we've got all these comments here in the chat room there.
What are you talking about upskirt cam for, DarkSakura?
I was doing that just to make fun of the DDR stuff.
Yeah, that's when I got subjected to that in 2003.
Okay, I'm not funny.
See?
What is this?
You were in an upskirt cam video?
Angel was not in an upskirt cam video!
No, I got subjected to the term upskirt cam in 2003.
I get it, I get it.
Alright, kids.
It's time we end this train wreck of a show.
Put the nails in the coffin.
Go around and get everybody's final thought.
Next week, boys and girls, it's episode 150.
Holy crap, are we getting old.
I still remember 69.
I don't remember 69.
Wait, your mic's off, I think.
No, it's on.
No.
Oh, it died for me.
Yeah, the mic is going out.
There you go.
I don't remember episode 69 because I was in San Diego living under the stairs in the Harry Potter room.
I remember that.
And the gay frat.
That was great.
All right.
So I don't know.
What are we going to do?
I was surrounded by all these cute guys and they were all gay.
What are we going to do for episode 150?
I mean, that's a pretty big number.
I say it's time.
Junk show!
No.
No, no more of those for a long time.
No, no, no, no, no.
I say we set the ferret on fire.
No!
We could rent a wood chipper and throw the ferret through a wood chipper.
We'll try performing surgery on that a little later.
Here, here, let me try something.
Here, let's switch for a minute.
What the fuck did the ferret ever do to you?
Okay?
The ferret has been good to you.
The ferret has been nice.
Check, check.
Here we go.
The ferret has been very good to you, yet you treat it so horribly.
Do you have some sort of deep-rooted fear of ferrets?
Ferret bias?
We're going to land ourselves an extra special guest for episode 150.
We're going to work on that.
You know what I would love to get?
I should send an email this week, see if I can make it happen.
Because I have connections.
We should get some of the folks that made in the groove on the show to argue with Loki.
I think it would be beautiful.
Oh my God, Rob.
You just got a song stuck in my head.
Do it!
Do it!
Do it!
That connected song that gets yourself connected.
Who was it that did that fucking song?
This shit is bananas.
B-A-N- No, forget it.
On the wall.
All right, all right.
The chat room is suggesting we have an orgy.
I think that was fluke.
Episode 150 is girls only.
Yeah, screw you.
Screw you.
Thank you.
All right.
Let's go around again.
Yeah, girls only.
All breaks will be girls.
Girls.
It took me a minute to get that joke.
All right, Angel, your final thought.
Meteos was interesting, but I'm still playing it.
Loki.
Beatmania is hard to play on a PSP, or a Game Boy Advance for that matter, or a Game Boy Color.
My final thought is, word around the office is you got a fat cock.
DarkSakura.
I don't know how I can top that one.
I do.
You should have seen how her eyes looked all of a sudden.
That was sexual harassment.
I'm going to report you to HR.
Oh wait, I am HR.
Guess what we do?
We flog.
Nah, we're all up for those medieval forms of... They flog the dolphins.
Oh, I was going to go flog the... No, forget it.
No, we use whips and chains and...
Okay, I was telling somebody about an anime called Star Trap, Offenders of the Universe.
So I'm going to go ahead and quote a line from that.
Eat me, beat me, make me write bad checks.
And the final word of the show.
One word to sum the whole damn thing up.
I'm going to give it to DDR Angel.
Come on, Angel.
You haven't been here for a month.
One word.
Sum it all up.
That's it.
Bye.

I had a real bad haircut and nowhere to go, except the Latin castle and Eckerdrum She had sweatpants, she liked to break dance, she wore a pair of shiny parachute pants I was a geek and she was a superstar Was a judge, was a judge, was a judge, yeah, was a judge, was a judge, like a wife While we're in the street for three nights, a judge
I tried to meet her set of standards I had a pretty good collection of masters of the universe I had Boba Fett and Greedo when I was close to 17 She had dates of Dr. Connick and E. Logg and she knew how to back the game She had eyes that looked around for the boys who I had lately grown to hate At the time I was working on a novel Just another proof of my distraction I sometimes wondered what she would think of that
Overwine and Crackers by a Lakeside, Wachita just moved back up and Moonwalked home.
There was a jerk who put you out, while we're in the street between us.
I guess I should have made a sacrifice, or tried to meet her down at Sanders.
But she didn't have respect for the drink as I didn't have respect for that.
Ruben's shoes were not my style and they're still not, I was into D&D.
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na.
When I look back upon the 80s, I never get pissed off at Ronald Reagan, I never paid attention to him back then
But that chick who wore the parachute pants, the one who broke my heart, the one who broke dance I just hope that one day we'll meet again I'm not sure, I'm not sure, I'm not sure, no, I'm not sure, I'm not sure what I would do I'm not sure it even matters Because I know wherever she is that she's got something stuck up in her ass And the clues to the doors that might just get taken only, taken only, taken only
Thank you very much for listening and we'll see you next week.
Closing time.
You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here.
That's it.
Show's over.
So piss off!
But come back next week.
No, yeah, or come back in 15 seconds, because we're going to reconnect to the Bomani Music and More program with all your favorite DDR, 2DX, and so many favorites!
Yeah, and listen to my show Tuesday.
Pump up the volume.
And listen to the podcast, because we're cool.
Good night, everybody!
