00:00:00,589 --> 00:00:03,470
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of August 1st, 2005.

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:14,132
[SPEAKER_03]: You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.

00:00:14,392 --> 00:00:18,092
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.

4
00:00:19,213 --> 00:00:26,114
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello once again, everybody, and welcome to another edition of Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition.

5
00:00:26,909 --> 00:00:34,294
[SPEAKER_05]: Our podcast dedicated to all those cool games, the niche games, the cult games, and games that don't suck, all the news you really want to know about.

6
00:00:34,775 --> 00:00:36,696
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.

7
00:00:36,776 --> 00:00:42,000
[SPEAKER_05]: Joining me, as always, my awesome co-host over there, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

8
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,421
[SPEAKER_01]: I sound so dead.

9
00:00:47,984 --> 00:00:49,185
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm undead.

10
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,721
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm so dead, it kind of makes me think of zombie I actually have Resident Evil t-shirts

11
00:01:17,139 --> 00:01:19,741
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm mad though because the shirt that I want they only sell online.

12
00:01:20,642 --> 00:01:20,922
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

13
00:01:20,962 --> 00:01:22,003
[SPEAKER_05]: What shirt's that?

14
00:01:22,023 --> 00:01:22,243
[SPEAKER_01]: 2D.

15
00:01:22,483 --> 00:01:23,324
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a Gorillaz shirt.

16
00:01:23,965 --> 00:01:24,625
[SPEAKER_01]: It's only online.

17
00:01:24,785 --> 00:01:27,167
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not the same Resident Evil I'm thinking of.

18
00:01:29,429 --> 00:01:30,009
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, anyway.

19
00:01:30,089 --> 00:01:33,552
[SPEAKER_01]: I already have a bunch of the ones they give to the video game stores.

20
00:01:33,712 --> 00:01:34,933
[SPEAKER_01]: I have all kinds of swag.

21
00:01:34,973 --> 00:01:36,415
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we know you get the hookup.

22
00:01:36,495 --> 00:01:37,015
[SPEAKER_05]: Lucky you.

23
00:01:37,035 --> 00:01:38,156
[SPEAKER_01]: I got the major hookup.

24
00:01:38,176 --> 00:01:39,817
[SPEAKER_05]: For the rest of us, there's the store.

25
00:01:39,937 --> 00:01:40,538
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

26
00:01:40,878 --> 00:01:42,439
[SPEAKER_01]: I got the major hookup this week.

27
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:45,142
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Launch Radio needs to give some of our listeners the hookup.

28
00:01:45,162 --> 00:01:46,783
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we got some prizes we gotta start giving away.

29
00:01:47,185 --> 00:01:50,866
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll have to do that in the next few weeks, but not tonight.

30
00:01:51,126 --> 00:01:55,007
[SPEAKER_05]: We're actually taping a little bit early this week because I'm going to be leaving.

31
00:01:55,047 --> 00:01:55,767
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm flying away.

32
00:01:55,787 --> 00:01:57,708
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to the East Coast very soon.

33
00:01:57,788 --> 00:02:00,008
[SPEAKER_01]: I have something for our listeners to hear.

34
00:02:00,148 --> 00:02:00,549
[SPEAKER_05]: What's that?

35
00:02:02,149 --> 00:02:02,989
[SPEAKER_05]: Your DS?

36
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:06,610
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very quiet.

37
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:07,210
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hard to hear.

38
00:02:09,891 --> 00:02:10,371
[SPEAKER_05]: What is this?

39
00:02:11,151 --> 00:02:12,492
[SPEAKER_05]: I hear some ambient noises.

40
00:02:15,012 --> 00:02:15,753
[SPEAKER_01]: I have Nintendogs.

41
00:02:16,013 --> 00:02:16,793
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendogs?

42
00:02:18,254 --> 00:02:19,255
[SPEAKER_05]: How did you get Nintendo?

43
00:02:19,295 --> 00:02:20,736
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, this is not the Japanese version.

44
00:02:20,916 --> 00:02:21,437
[SPEAKER_01]: Nope, it's not.

45
00:02:21,937 --> 00:02:22,638
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the U.S.

46
00:02:22,698 --> 00:02:23,038
[SPEAKER_05]: version.

47
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,041
[SPEAKER_05]: We can barely hear it on there.

48
00:02:27,121 --> 00:02:28,022
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, it's not very loud.

49
00:02:28,042 --> 00:02:29,123
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell us about your gaming week.

50
00:02:29,163 --> 00:02:29,904
[SPEAKER_05]: What's going on here?

51
00:02:30,164 --> 00:02:30,944
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up with the Nintendogs?

52
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:34,647
[SPEAKER_01]: I have come into a copy of the five-minute demo of Nintendogs.

53
00:02:35,448 --> 00:02:39,732
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people were going to start writing you some nasty emails if you had the full version, but still, you got the demo.

54
00:02:39,752 --> 00:02:40,332
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of neat.

55
00:02:40,772 --> 00:02:41,713
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been playing with my puppies.

56
00:02:43,415 --> 00:02:43,875
[SPEAKER_05]: What, Loki?

57
00:02:44,095 --> 00:02:45,116
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got news on that, actually.

58
00:02:45,646 --> 00:02:48,630
[SPEAKER_04]: There are going to be people coming into the copies of Nintendogs early.

59
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:49,451
[SPEAKER_05]: How so?

60
00:02:50,432 --> 00:02:52,154
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if we want to get in the news right away.

61
00:02:52,394 --> 00:02:54,897
[SPEAKER_05]: No, let DarkSakura talk about the game first, then we'll get to that.

62
00:02:56,059 --> 00:03:01,145
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so tell us a little more about the game, because at E3, the line was so big to play.

63
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:02,130
[SPEAKER_05]: I heard it bark.

64
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:07,532
[SPEAKER_05]: The line was so big to play this game at E3 that I barely got a chance to really look at it.

65
00:03:07,772 --> 00:03:12,053
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it was one of my favorite games of the show, but you've actually had a chance to play it a little more in detail this week.

66
00:03:12,673 --> 00:03:14,014
[SPEAKER_05]: What the heck is Nintendogs?

67
00:03:14,074 --> 00:03:15,054
[SPEAKER_05]: What makes it so dang special?

68
00:03:15,074 --> 00:03:16,335
[SPEAKER_01]: You play with your bubbies.

69
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:22,757
[SPEAKER_05]: What makes it so great, though?

70
00:03:23,057 --> 00:03:24,037
[SPEAKER_01]: You play with your bubbies.

71
00:03:24,177 --> 00:03:24,757
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it?

72
00:03:24,837 --> 00:03:25,838
[SPEAKER_05]: You just play with dogs?

73
00:03:25,858 --> 00:03:26,438
[SPEAKER_01]: Listen to this.

74
00:03:26,718 --> 00:03:26,998
[SPEAKER_05]: What are you...

75
00:03:32,301 --> 00:03:33,713
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so they're barking, we get it.

76
00:03:34,096 --> 00:03:34,479
[SPEAKER_05]: That's cute.

77
00:03:35,751 --> 00:03:38,932
[SPEAKER_05]: If we had the graphics, especially, because the graphics are a real cute part of this game.

78
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:41,233
[SPEAKER_01]: You can play music to your puppies and they start barking along with it.

79
00:03:42,534 --> 00:03:45,275
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can throw the frisbee and they catch it.

80
00:03:45,515 --> 00:03:47,396
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you noticed an object to this game at all?

81
00:03:48,236 --> 00:03:50,097
[SPEAKER_05]: You play with your puppies!

82
00:03:50,377 --> 00:03:57,479
[SPEAKER_05]: But even in Animal Crossing, which was a very free game where you could do practically whatever you wanted, there was still that goal of paying off your house.

83
00:03:57,799 --> 00:04:04,562
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, as you play through the game, you can train your dogs and stuff, and you compete in different events and stuff, like they have dog training events.

84
00:04:04,977 --> 00:04:06,458
[SPEAKER_04]: and you unlock more dog breeds.

85
00:04:07,359 --> 00:04:25,073
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, if other people, say for instance you have Nintendogs Chihuahua and someone has Nintendogs Labrador Retriever or something like that, if you're nearby and they interact with each other, it unlocks the Labrador Retriever and the one with Chihuahua and Chihuahua and the one with Labrador Retriever.

86
00:04:25,593 --> 00:04:32,158
[SPEAKER_05]: So even though they're selling this game, when they announced it was going on sale it sounded like Pokemon Red and Blue or only certain...

87
00:04:34,361 --> 00:04:36,322
[SPEAKER_05]: All the Japanese dogs are unlockable through the unlocks.

88
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:40,083
[SPEAKER_04]: What we need to see, though, is if the Japanese version and the US ones will interact.

89
00:04:58,271 --> 00:05:00,973
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that would be interesting, because I know people over here with the Japanese version.

90
00:05:01,113 --> 00:05:05,155
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you walk by with the game and someone else has their dogs, they'll start barking.

91
00:05:05,655 --> 00:05:06,195
[SPEAKER_05]: That's cool.

92
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:09,858
[SPEAKER_01]: If it detects another copy of the game on and playing nearby.

93
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,739
[SPEAKER_05]: What did you think after your five-minute demo?

94
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:13,279
[SPEAKER_01]: Puppies!

95
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:15,381
[SPEAKER_05]: So in other words, you're sold on this game.

96
00:05:15,641 --> 00:05:16,101
[SPEAKER_01]: Puppies!

97
00:05:16,221 --> 00:05:17,562
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll be buying the full version when it comes out?

98
00:05:17,582 --> 00:05:19,023
[SPEAKER_01]: All they need, Mike, is Nintendo kitties.

99
00:05:19,483 --> 00:05:21,824
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I am buying all three versions when this comes out.

100
00:05:21,884 --> 00:05:23,105
[SPEAKER_05]: But you don't need all three versions!

101
00:05:23,465 --> 00:05:24,246
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care!

102
00:05:26,008 --> 00:05:32,453
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm buying them for the strict purpose of annoying my co-worker because he hates this game because it's so damn cute.

103
00:05:32,913 --> 00:05:35,635
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I'm going to be playing it with the volume full blast.

104
00:05:35,675 --> 00:05:38,958
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, you know what?

105
00:05:38,998 --> 00:05:41,180
[SPEAKER_05]: There's three of us, three versions of the game.

106
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,100
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting in the lab already.

107
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:44,242
[SPEAKER_05]: We should get the three different versions.

108
00:05:44,262 --> 00:05:44,862
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll get the Chihuahua.

109
00:05:44,983 --> 00:05:45,923
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, there we go.

110
00:05:46,223 --> 00:05:47,184
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll get the Shih Tzu.

111
00:05:47,224 --> 00:05:48,185
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully it's in a different one.

112
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:53,026
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to get the lab anyway because it has other breeds that I want.

113
00:05:53,186 --> 00:06:00,195
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a Jack Russell Terrier and I think the miniature Dachshund.

114
00:06:00,695 --> 00:06:01,536
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just going to buy all three.

115
00:06:02,557 --> 00:06:03,759
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't wait to trade.

116
00:06:04,099 --> 00:06:04,820
[SPEAKER_05]: You just need all three.

117
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,362
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, at least I know where I get the dogs from.

118
00:06:06,682 --> 00:06:08,044
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, anything else in your gaming week?

119
00:06:08,925 --> 00:06:09,766
[SPEAKER_01]: I play lots of Ragnarok.

120
00:06:10,689 --> 00:06:11,649
[SPEAKER_05]: Ragnarok Online

121
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:30,882
[SPEAKER_05]: Like around the corner.

122
00:06:30,902 --> 00:06:32,803
[SPEAKER_05]: It was something that was going to be here by year's end.

123
00:06:32,843 --> 00:06:34,104
[SPEAKER_05]: I could have thought I read somewhere.

124
00:06:34,444 --> 00:06:34,804
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope.

125
00:06:34,864 --> 00:06:36,385
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep checking Gravity's site.

126
00:06:36,765 --> 00:06:40,427
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's another game that one of our listeners suggested to us.

127
00:06:40,447 --> 00:06:46,150
[SPEAKER_01]: I got an email from Iris, who is in South Korea.

128
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:47,111
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, Iris.

129
00:06:47,931 --> 00:06:48,691
[SPEAKER_05]: That was my grandma's name.

130
00:06:49,272 --> 00:06:49,532
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

131
00:06:49,812 --> 00:06:50,492
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a nice name.

132
00:06:51,453 --> 00:06:56,655
[SPEAKER_01]: Who suggested a game that I actually haven't had too much of an opportunity.

133
00:06:56,715 --> 00:06:57,556
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called Darwinia.

134
00:06:58,453 --> 00:07:04,975
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the name already, but I actually was intending on downloading it a couple of days ago and I had some computer issues.

135
00:07:05,307 --> 00:07:06,568
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

136
00:07:34,228 --> 00:07:35,209
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

137
00:08:03,471 --> 00:08:06,934
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not actually going to buy any more movies, but I've been playing that.

138
00:08:07,014 --> 00:08:14,899
[SPEAKER_04]: I played Bomberman Panic Bomber, which I was hoping it was more of a Bomberman game, but it's another puzzle game.

139
00:08:15,139 --> 00:08:16,440
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the PSP one?

140
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,160
[SPEAKER_04]: PSP one.

141
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:20,482
[SPEAKER_04]: They have a lot of puzzle games for the PSP out there.

142
00:08:22,363 --> 00:08:24,084
[SPEAKER_04]: Really, yeah, those have been the games.

143
00:08:25,645 --> 00:08:26,066
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else?

144
00:08:26,286 --> 00:08:26,746
[SPEAKER_04]: Just those games?

145
00:08:27,287 --> 00:08:28,967
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I wish I had played some PlayStation 2 stuff.

146
00:08:29,007 --> 00:08:30,468
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm waiting for Graffiti Kingdom.

147
00:08:30,748 --> 00:08:34,169
[SPEAKER_04]: They sent out a press release on Thursday saying, Oh, the game got shipped!

148
00:08:34,449 --> 00:08:35,209
[SPEAKER_04]: Go to GameStop.

149
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:40,330
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we have our information that says it's coming out on August 8th or August 9th.

150
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:42,630
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, yeah, that's what I heard before this press release came out.

151
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:44,171
[SPEAKER_04]: Because nobody wants Graffiti Kingdom but you.

152
00:08:44,431 --> 00:08:45,111
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they told me.

153
00:08:45,331 --> 00:08:49,572
[SPEAKER_04]: They're all, you're going to have to pre-order this game if you want it at all because we're getting like three copies total.

154
00:08:49,992 --> 00:08:52,693
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, fuck you, I will go to Fry's.

155
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:53,813
[SPEAKER_04]: So, eat that.

156
00:08:55,191 --> 00:08:55,691
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

157
00:08:56,472 --> 00:08:57,853
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that the sequel to Magic Penjel?

158
00:08:58,093 --> 00:08:59,654
[SPEAKER_04]: Sort of.

159
00:08:59,774 --> 00:09:06,017
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a sequel in the game sense, where you have the same gameplay and stuff, but the storyline is not a direct sequel.

160
00:09:06,217 --> 00:09:09,399
[SPEAKER_05]: Magic Penjel, for those that don't know, was this kind of cultish game.

161
00:09:09,439 --> 00:09:10,440
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it was really big.

162
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:14,202
[SPEAKER_05]: It had a rock-paper-scissors battle style system, so it was pretty simple in concept.

163
00:09:14,542 --> 00:09:18,725
[SPEAKER_05]: But you could draw your own monsters, which was really the cool thing about it.

164
00:09:18,765 --> 00:09:21,326
[SPEAKER_05]: You literally drew your own... It's like Pokemon, but you draw your own Pokemon.

165
00:09:21,626 --> 00:09:22,347
[SPEAKER_05]: So of course...

166
00:09:23,067 --> 00:09:34,170
[SPEAKER_05]: My friends and I were playing this game and we were drawing all sorts of phallic things and just all the two-year-old type humor you could think of we were drawing.

167
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:35,511
[SPEAKER_05]: And the game doesn't stop you.

168
00:09:37,311 --> 00:09:38,912
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there was the big cock monster.

169
00:09:38,972 --> 00:09:40,972
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I remember there was like the big cock monster.

170
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:45,334
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I'm like, you know, I walked out of the room for a bit and I come back in.

171
00:09:45,354 --> 00:09:46,394
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, is that a cannon?

172
00:09:46,594 --> 00:09:47,334
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's a penis.

173
00:09:47,594 --> 00:09:48,415
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you can't draw.

174
00:09:48,895 --> 00:09:49,115
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

175
00:09:49,741 --> 00:09:50,721
[SPEAKER_01]: Terminator, Robocop,

176
00:10:15,609 --> 00:10:16,029
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

177
00:10:32,609 --> 00:10:34,369
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, I'll just read the little blurb on here.

178
00:10:34,409 --> 00:10:43,832
[SPEAKER_01]: The world of Darwinia is a virtual theme park running inside a computer network built by a computer genius named Dr. Sepulveda, I guess.

179
00:10:44,212 --> 00:10:44,452
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

180
00:10:45,172 --> 00:10:48,933
[SPEAKER_01]: Darwinia is populated by a sentient involving life form called the Darwinians.

181
00:10:49,313 --> 00:10:53,714
[SPEAKER_01]: They are the product of decades worth of research into genetic algorithms.

182
00:10:53,994 --> 00:10:55,174
[SPEAKER_05]: So what kind of game does it look like?

183
00:10:55,194 --> 00:10:57,115
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I thought this was just another, you know...

184
00:10:58,061 --> 00:11:01,806
[SPEAKER_05]: Ye Olde RPG style game, but this looks like a futuristic type thing.

185
00:11:01,946 --> 00:11:03,949
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like The Sims meets Tron.

186
00:11:04,389 --> 00:11:05,631
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks kind of like Lawnmower Man.

187
00:11:07,153 --> 00:11:08,054
[SPEAKER_05]: To me, I don't know.

188
00:11:08,154 --> 00:11:10,477
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me look at a few more of these screenshots on here, though.

189
00:11:11,418 --> 00:11:12,900
[SPEAKER_01]: It really does look very...

190
00:11:14,151 --> 00:11:15,672
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's download the demo and check it out.

191
00:11:15,812 --> 00:11:17,473
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the listener was wanting us to check it out.

192
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:20,415
[SPEAKER_01]: I had intended on doing so.

193
00:11:20,595 --> 00:11:23,016
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll probably get that started when I get home tonight.

194
00:11:23,156 --> 00:11:24,277
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be a follow-up in the future.

195
00:11:25,177 --> 00:11:27,479
[SPEAKER_05]: My gaming week, I didn't play anything new, guys.

196
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:29,240
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry to say, I've been preparing for my trip.

197
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:32,782
[SPEAKER_05]: But for some wacky reason, I decided to get back into Guild Wars.

198
00:11:33,242 --> 00:11:37,945
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I was like, okay, I'm not going to pay money to reactivate my Final Fantasy XI account when I'm going to be leaving soon.

199
00:11:38,185 --> 00:11:39,846
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't want to start a new game again.

200
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:42,968
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been contemplating checking out World of Warcraft.

201
00:11:43,028 --> 00:11:44,669
[SPEAKER_05]: One of my friends is really, really trying to get me on there.

202
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:46,911
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, PSO.

203
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:48,652
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura's trying to get me on PSO.

204
00:11:49,773 --> 00:11:52,054
[SPEAKER_05]: But Guild Wars, luckily, loving it.

205
00:11:52,495 --> 00:11:54,216
[SPEAKER_05]: Once you buy it, you can play it forever for free.

206
00:11:54,256 --> 00:11:55,897
[SPEAKER_05]: No monthly fee, so I can go back whenever I want.

207
00:11:55,937 --> 00:11:59,359
[SPEAKER_05]: And I knew I would do this, too, that I'd play it for two weeks, leave, go back again.

208
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:01,481
[SPEAKER_05]: But here's the weird thing about my habits with Guild Wars.

209
00:12:01,801 --> 00:12:02,882
[SPEAKER_05]: I started a new character.

210
00:12:03,322 --> 00:12:06,004
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody in my old guild doesn't play the game anymore, so it's just me.

211
00:12:06,304 --> 00:12:08,646
[SPEAKER_05]: So here I am playing the game by myself, and I'm thinking...

212
00:12:09,502 --> 00:12:11,223
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm playing an MMO by myself.

213
00:12:13,344 --> 00:12:14,024
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the point?

214
00:12:14,324 --> 00:12:15,965
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's still kind of fun.

215
00:12:16,045 --> 00:12:18,906
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I'd be having more fun if there were people out there that would play with me.

216
00:12:20,507 --> 00:12:21,988
[SPEAKER_01]: If someone would buy me the game, I would play.

217
00:12:22,428 --> 00:12:24,009
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, got 50 bucks to spare?

218
00:12:25,189 --> 00:12:26,650
[SPEAKER_01]: If someone would buy me the game, I would play.

219
00:12:27,911 --> 00:12:30,592
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we've got a really nice listener out there.

220
00:12:30,652 --> 00:12:32,653
[SPEAKER_01]: I sure as heck ain't paying money for it.

221
00:12:32,673 --> 00:12:33,513
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen Guild Wars.

222
00:12:34,594 --> 00:12:35,754
[SPEAKER_05]: I like Guild Wars.

223
00:12:35,794 --> 00:12:36,174
[SPEAKER_05]: It's neat.

224
00:12:36,254 --> 00:12:36,355
[SPEAKER_05]: It's...

225
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,081
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like the style.

226
00:12:41,181 --> 00:12:41,882
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't bother me.

227
00:12:41,902 --> 00:12:42,342
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not pretty.

228
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:47,264
[SPEAKER_05]: It's more of a strategy, like strategy action fused, which is kind of neat.

229
00:12:47,284 --> 00:12:51,206
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll have to pull my cold dead body away from Final Fantasy XI.

230
00:12:51,546 --> 00:12:53,987
[SPEAKER_04]: I may not have played it for over a month, but you know what?

231
00:12:54,467 --> 00:12:55,508
[SPEAKER_04]: I am not quitting.

232
00:12:55,548 --> 00:12:57,909
[SPEAKER_04]: Not from my cold dead hands.

233
00:12:57,989 --> 00:13:01,891
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just pissed off that I can't download the Korean version of Ragnarok online.

234
00:13:02,331 --> 00:13:02,651
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the...

235
00:13:05,112 --> 00:13:12,202
[SPEAKER_01]: The Korean Ragnarok site is letting me get it, and I don't want to have to pay $30 for three more months of Ragnarok Online to play my old dead character.

236
00:13:13,043 --> 00:13:18,230
[SPEAKER_01]: Thing is, my character on the old Ragnarok will never be deleted.

237
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:22,155
[SPEAKER_05]: For those that don't know Ragnarok, because we've talked about it an awful lot tonight, real quick, describe it.

238
00:13:23,038 --> 00:13:25,159
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really cutesy MMORPG.

239
00:13:25,259 --> 00:13:25,980
[SPEAKER_01]: It's adorable.

240
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:29,181
[SPEAKER_01]: I found the picture of your character who wore the little ribbon.

241
00:13:29,301 --> 00:13:30,642
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I had a character that wore a ribbon.

242
00:13:31,542 --> 00:13:33,723
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's like Secret of Mana in a way.

243
00:13:34,404 --> 00:13:34,944
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of.

244
00:13:35,264 --> 00:13:36,285
[SPEAKER_05]: But imagine it as an MMO.

245
00:13:36,365 --> 00:13:37,265
[SPEAKER_05]: In a 3D world.

246
00:13:38,085 --> 00:13:38,986
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really adorable.

247
00:13:39,046 --> 00:13:45,989
[SPEAKER_01]: If you just go to rocknrockonline.com Not 3D in the Halo or Doom 3D sense.

248
00:13:46,009 --> 00:13:49,011
[SPEAKER_05]: 3D in the up at an angle shot.

249
00:13:49,151 --> 00:13:49,271
[SPEAKER_05]: Like

250
00:13:49,904 --> 00:13:52,426
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a 3D environment, but the characters are sprites.

251
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:52,866
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

252
00:13:53,446 --> 00:13:53,767
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

253
00:13:54,727 --> 00:13:55,007
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

254
00:13:56,148 --> 00:13:59,290
[SPEAKER_05]: Quick news story on Final Fantasy XI, since Loki brought it up to start us off tonight.

255
00:13:59,971 --> 00:14:03,993
[SPEAKER_05]: Since you're saying they won't tear the game from your cold, dead hands, how about a story that might tick you off?

256
00:14:04,614 --> 00:14:08,696
[SPEAKER_05]: Final Fantasy XI, the Vanadil Collection, will ship for the PC on August 16th.

257
00:14:09,077 --> 00:14:10,398
[SPEAKER_05]: What is this, a new expansion pack?

258
00:14:10,798 --> 00:14:17,562
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's just Final Fantasy XI, Rise of the Zillert, and Chains of Promethea, and Tetra Master, all bundled together for $29.99.

259
00:14:19,119 --> 00:14:24,122
[SPEAKER_05]: So those of you guys that spent $50 on the game and $30 on the expansion, just got screwed.

260
00:14:24,282 --> 00:14:27,344
[SPEAKER_05]: But it happens with every MMO, it really does.

261
00:14:27,464 --> 00:14:29,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, look at Rise of the Zillards at one time.

262
00:14:30,426 --> 00:14:34,248
[SPEAKER_04]: It was being sold as an expansion, and then they just update it.

263
00:14:34,728 --> 00:14:35,009
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.

264
00:14:36,058 --> 00:14:37,679
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, just thought I'd share that.

265
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:42,163
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see, I actually have an abundance of Square news tonight.

266
00:14:42,203 --> 00:14:43,964
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me get some of these other Square stories out of the way.

267
00:14:44,285 --> 00:14:45,846
[SPEAKER_05]: Kingdom Hearts 2 has a date.

268
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:52,371
[SPEAKER_05]: This being announced at the Squeenix Party 2005 event in Tokyo, hence why we have all the Squeenix news tonight.

269
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:56,655
[SPEAKER_05]: Kingdom Hearts 2 will be out in Japan this year in December.

270
00:14:57,195 --> 00:14:59,157
[SPEAKER_05]: No set-in-stone date for the U.S.

271
00:14:59,277 --> 00:14:59,457
[SPEAKER_05]: yet.

272
00:14:59,517 --> 00:15:01,939
[SPEAKER_05]: However, they've really been pushing to localize their games quickly.

273
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:04,902
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to admit, I'm surprised they're going to miss Christmas at this rate.

274
00:15:05,482 --> 00:15:08,945
[SPEAKER_05]: I would have thought Kingdom Hearts 2 would be a very powerful Christmas title to have out there.

275
00:15:08,965 --> 00:15:13,590
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems kind of silly to miss Christmas here, but it ain't my company.

276
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:19,075
[SPEAKER_01]: Also keep in mind, though, when we get it, it's going to be better than the Japanese one.

277
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:21,101
[SPEAKER_05]: People are going to buy it no matter what.

278
00:15:21,141 --> 00:15:22,741
[SPEAKER_05]: What makes you say it's going to be better than the Japanese one?

279
00:15:22,781 --> 00:15:23,661
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like the last one.

280
00:15:23,681 --> 00:15:25,762
[SPEAKER_01]: They actually had to redo an international version.

281
00:15:26,222 --> 00:15:30,984
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Square Enix kind of does that stuff where they add... Because the Sephiroth battle wasn't in the original Kingdom Hearts, right?

282
00:15:31,084 --> 00:15:32,004
[SPEAKER_05]: That was something new for North America.

283
00:15:32,024 --> 00:15:40,847
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually wasn't in ours either, but they brought out the sort of updated international version that had the Sephiroth battle and the deep dive trailer.

284
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:42,513
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

285
00:15:42,613 --> 00:15:45,215
[SPEAKER_05]: Final Fantasy XII also got a date at the Squeenix party.

286
00:15:45,315 --> 00:15:48,597
[SPEAKER_05]: Ships in Japan on March 16th, 2006.

287
00:15:49,437 --> 00:15:50,318
[SPEAKER_05]: So still a little wait.

288
00:15:50,358 --> 00:15:53,740
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's just Japan's date, meaning we've got to wait three to four months.

289
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:57,222
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe we're looking at Christmas next year for Final Fantasy XII.

290
00:15:57,722 --> 00:15:58,503
[SPEAKER_05]: Rumors why?

291
00:15:59,043 --> 00:16:01,145
[SPEAKER_05]: Because Final Fantasy XII supposedly is in the can.

292
00:16:01,365 --> 00:16:02,165
[SPEAKER_05]: It's done in Japan.

293
00:16:02,225 --> 00:16:02,886
[SPEAKER_05]: It's ready to go.

294
00:16:03,006 --> 00:16:04,627
[SPEAKER_05]: Just they're putting the finishing touches on it.

295
00:16:04,907 --> 00:16:09,430
[SPEAKER_05]: But supposedly, because of the Kingdom Hearts 2 news, that's why they're waiting on Final Fantasy XII.

296
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:13,885
[SPEAKER_05]: Final Fantasy VII Advent Children will be released in theaters in Japan

297
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:36,163
[SPEAKER_01]: and probably in theaters in Berkeley and little tiny theaters.

298
00:16:36,183 --> 00:16:40,065
[SPEAKER_04]: I told those Sony reps when they came to our work, I'm like, you got to fucking put this in theaters.

299
00:16:40,105 --> 00:16:41,846
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, man, it's all this marketing.

300
00:16:41,906 --> 00:16:44,847
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, word of mouth, word of mouth.

301
00:16:44,967 --> 00:16:48,489
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, nothing, not even news on any type of U.S.

302
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:48,869
[SPEAKER_05]: release.

303
00:16:48,929 --> 00:16:51,591
[SPEAKER_05]: Little distributionary, no North American distribution as of yet.

304
00:16:51,931 --> 00:16:54,592
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the reason why I'm thinking it's not going to happen in the U.S.

305
00:16:54,672 --> 00:16:57,254
[SPEAKER_05]: because it's going to premiere in Japan on September 8th.

306
00:16:58,171 --> 00:17:00,872
[SPEAKER_05]: The DVD, by the way, comes out September 14th.

307
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:06,135
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's really just a super sneak preview for those diehard people that have to see it in the theater.

308
00:17:06,595 --> 00:17:08,236
[SPEAKER_05]: And if I was in Japan, I'd be one of them.

309
00:17:08,596 --> 00:17:09,937
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's going to have a limited run here.

310
00:17:10,437 --> 00:17:10,878
[SPEAKER_05]: You think?

311
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:12,559
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't... Escaflowne.

312
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,160
[SPEAKER_01]: That had a limited run.

313
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:15,920
[SPEAKER_05]: But would they get that?

314
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:19,122
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we're talking... We're only about six weeks out from this now.

315
00:17:19,502 --> 00:17:21,363
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think that's enough time to put together a theater release.

316
00:17:21,703 --> 00:17:23,004
[SPEAKER_01]: I do believe that there would be time.

317
00:17:23,224 --> 00:17:23,704
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

318
00:17:23,864 --> 00:17:24,245
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

319
00:17:24,305 --> 00:17:25,525
[SPEAKER_01]: Slap some subtitles on that.

320
00:17:25,785 --> 00:17:26,466
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see.

321
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:28,699
[SPEAKER_05]: Screwdubs.

322
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:30,900
[SPEAKER_05]: Still more stories, still more stories.

323
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,640
[SPEAKER_05]: Kingdom Hearts 2.

324
00:17:32,881 --> 00:17:37,044
[SPEAKER_05]: Hikaru Utada, of course, did the theme song for the first Kingdom Hearts game.

325
00:17:37,404 --> 00:17:38,125
[SPEAKER_05]: She's coming back.

326
00:17:38,205 --> 00:17:42,647
[SPEAKER_05]: She's going to sing a song called Passion, which will be in Kingdom Hearts 2.

327
00:17:43,508 --> 00:17:51,393
[SPEAKER_05]: No word yet as to whether she's going to record it in English and Japanese, but since she did the first one in English and Japanese... And she is fully bilingual.

328
00:17:51,513 --> 00:17:55,316
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly, and she has her own album out here, which I don't think did so hot.

329
00:17:55,336 --> 00:17:55,736
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm-hmm.

330
00:17:56,623 --> 00:17:58,646
[SPEAKER_04]: She's easy breezy and you're Japanese-y.

331
00:18:00,367 --> 00:18:02,330
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, so she'll have the song Passion.

332
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:05,653
[SPEAKER_05]: The single should be coming out, being put out by Toshiba EMI.

333
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:10,699
[SPEAKER_05]: It will come out around December, same time as Kingdom Hearts 2 is planning to come out.

334
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:14,721
[SPEAKER_05]: One more story I got, and it's a Final Fantasy XI story again.

335
00:18:15,021 --> 00:18:23,885
[SPEAKER_05]: You know how Xbox 360 Final Fantasy XI has everybody going, OMG, OMG, what's going to be different in the Final Fantasy XI version on Xbox 360?

336
00:18:23,985 --> 00:18:27,226
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you're going to find out if you live in Germany.

337
00:18:28,894 --> 00:18:33,656
[SPEAKER_05]: Get this, they're actually going to be showing it in Germany at the Games Convention in Leipzig.

338
00:18:33,996 --> 00:18:36,737
[SPEAKER_05]: That happens August 17th through the 21st.

339
00:18:37,218 --> 00:18:47,462
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't say in the press release that it's going to be playable, but it does say in the press release that European gamers will get their first look at the next generation gateway to the world of Anadyl.

340
00:18:48,162 --> 00:18:48,703
[SPEAKER_05]: Should be interesting.

341
00:18:49,003 --> 00:18:54,245
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I heard a rumor, one quick rumor about, for those of you Final Fantasy XI players, I don't know if this is true or not, but...

342
00:18:55,052 --> 00:19:00,976
[SPEAKER_05]: What they're going to do with the 360 is they're going to put the same upgrades in 360 that they do on the PC and PlayStation 2 users.

343
00:19:00,996 --> 00:19:02,517
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, you're going to get left behind in this.

344
00:19:02,857 --> 00:19:04,618
[SPEAKER_05]: But they're going to make the capes viewable.

345
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:09,121
[SPEAKER_05]: It's supposedly something... Because you know how your character won't wear a cape in Final Fantasy XI, but you never see it?

346
00:19:09,621 --> 00:19:11,643
[SPEAKER_05]: Supposedly, that's going to be one of the graphical upgrades.

347
00:19:11,943 --> 00:19:13,024
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I don't know.

348
00:19:13,104 --> 00:19:14,164
[SPEAKER_05]: Take it with a grain of salt, people.

349
00:19:14,364 --> 00:19:16,126
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll find out when the game is shown in Europe.

350
00:19:16,146 --> 00:19:16,826
[SPEAKER_05]: But that would be kind of neat.

351
00:19:16,846 --> 00:19:21,109
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's an option you would be able to turn on in the PC version if you have a high enough graphics card.

352
00:19:21,169 --> 00:19:22,109
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I don't see why not.

353
00:19:22,129 --> 00:19:22,970
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly.

354
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:24,431
[SPEAKER_01]: My graphics card would handle it.

355
00:19:24,639 --> 00:19:25,179
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, most of them.

356
00:19:25,199 --> 00:19:29,082
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm surprised they haven't released a patch like that for capes in the PC version.

357
00:19:29,262 --> 00:19:30,262
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, maybe they're waiting for this.

358
00:19:31,023 --> 00:19:31,223
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

359
00:19:31,363 --> 00:19:32,203
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you never know.

360
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:33,924
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they can do... Who knows?

361
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:39,307
[SPEAKER_04]: With the new 360 game coming out, they're probably going to release another expansion at the same time.

362
00:19:40,228 --> 00:19:40,648
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

363
00:19:40,688 --> 00:19:41,168
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe.

364
00:19:41,408 --> 00:19:41,669
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe.

365
00:19:41,689 --> 00:19:42,169
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't know yet.

366
00:19:42,409 --> 00:19:43,229
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, possibly.

367
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:43,650
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

368
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:43,990
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

369
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:51,294
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, let's go past the Squeenix news, and let's get into inflating our egos a little bit by opening up the old mailbag.

370
00:19:51,454 --> 00:19:52,755
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you want to send us an email...

371
00:19:53,897 --> 00:20:01,526
[SPEAKER_05]: All you have to do is send an email to togo, T-O-G-O, at orangeloungeradio.com and DarkSakura will have something to say to you.

372
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:03,168
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, what do you have to say tonight?

373
00:20:03,689 --> 00:20:05,831
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually got a bunch of email.

374
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:10,337
[SPEAKER_01]: And one, um... The first one I want to bring up is by, um...

375
00:20:11,574 --> 00:20:16,839
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone named Rue, who wrote in to us about the whole hot coffee deal.

376
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:26,569
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, and this is something that I actually didn't see on any of my references, but when I went back and dug deeper after receiving the email, yes it is true.

377
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:33,056
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole deal was actually sort of launched off by Hillary Clinton.

378
00:20:34,031 --> 00:20:35,312
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of.

379
00:20:35,432 --> 00:20:36,952
[SPEAKER_05]: She got behind it, too.

380
00:20:37,092 --> 00:20:41,634
[SPEAKER_05]: I think having her behind it really threw the thing into orbit.

381
00:20:41,794 --> 00:20:43,535
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it was kind of like where it went to the next level.

382
00:20:43,835 --> 00:20:52,219
[SPEAKER_05]: But I believe it was originally brought to the attention by Assemblyman Leland Yee, I think, because they had this guy on G4 TV.

383
00:20:52,239 --> 00:20:55,400
[SPEAKER_05]: And usually I don't talk about G4 TV because...

384
00:20:56,120 --> 00:21:00,363
[SPEAKER_05]: They have a reputation for having bad programming, but actually it's gotten a lot better.

385
00:21:00,763 --> 00:21:06,407
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually watched G4TV.com, and ever since they got that new guy on the show, he's really brought it up.

386
00:21:06,427 --> 00:21:11,631
[SPEAKER_05]: The two girls are up to that same level, I think, because they actually had the Leland Yee on their show.

387
00:21:11,811 --> 00:21:13,492
[SPEAKER_05]: It was actually a pretty good interview, I have to say.

388
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:15,233
[SPEAKER_05]: It was kind of interesting, I thought.

389
00:21:15,533 --> 00:21:16,574
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I just wanted to interject that.

390
00:21:17,335 --> 00:21:23,579
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this email, though, basically it's not just the conservatives that are behind it.

391
00:21:24,487 --> 00:21:38,492
[SPEAKER_01]: we've got basically everybody and you know it also brought up to the whole reason why I didn't go Democrat way back you know because of Lieberman I was not going to have Lieberman and Tipper Gore anywhere near our video game industry

392
00:21:39,789 --> 00:21:58,339
[SPEAKER_01]: There was also, though, another article, though, this made me think of, that I'm going to get back to the mailbag, I just have to see where I stored this article, about how actually the rate of crime in our country's youth decreased.

393
00:21:58,359 --> 00:21:59,280
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have a link to this?

394
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,061
[SPEAKER_05]: I bet a lot of people would be interested in reading this.

395
00:22:01,661 --> 00:22:03,042
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I do, and it's going to...

396
00:22:03,968 --> 00:22:05,090
[SPEAKER_01]: Take me just a brief moment.

397
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:06,733
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, if you'll take care of one of our other emails.

398
00:22:06,773 --> 00:22:07,113
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all right.

399
00:22:07,133 --> 00:22:08,135
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'll go to one of the other emails.

400
00:22:08,175 --> 00:22:11,841
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to say, was that the same guy who you invited to do the article for the site?

401
00:22:12,042 --> 00:22:12,482
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it is.

402
00:22:12,542 --> 00:22:15,207
[SPEAKER_01]: I invited him to write an editorial regarding that for us.

403
00:22:15,227 --> 00:22:15,768
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be cool.

404
00:22:16,108 --> 00:22:17,110
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I said, guys...

405
00:22:18,755 --> 00:22:28,962
[SPEAKER_05]: Politics and gaming podcasts sometimes don't mix, but that's alright, you know, hey, we gotta, you know, whatever you believe in, at least go out and vote, cause we get the freedom to do that in this country.

406
00:22:29,002 --> 00:22:41,111
[SPEAKER_04]: Jesus, you know, here's what it comes down to, okay, the whole hot coffee mod hit a little too close to home, if you know what I mean, with Hillary Clinton, because the whole hot coffee mod starts off with CJ coming in for some lovin',

407
00:22:42,083 --> 00:22:42,884
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the woman do?

408
00:22:42,904 --> 00:22:44,504
[SPEAKER_04]: She gets down to business.

409
00:22:45,345 --> 00:22:46,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, damn.

410
00:22:47,086 --> 00:22:47,606
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, damn.

411
00:22:47,626 --> 00:22:48,306
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, oh, oh.

412
00:22:48,406 --> 00:22:48,866
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, wait.

413
00:22:48,946 --> 00:22:50,567
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that happened to Hillary.

414
00:22:50,787 --> 00:22:51,728
[SPEAKER_04]: That happened to Hillary.

415
00:22:51,768 --> 00:22:52,468
[SPEAKER_05]: Look, look, look.

416
00:22:52,828 --> 00:22:59,071
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the issue here is really about the regulation of the games, not trying to ban them.

417
00:22:59,411 --> 00:23:02,953
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think, remember, guys, Hillary Clinton isn't trying to ban the games.

418
00:23:02,993 --> 00:23:04,334
[SPEAKER_05]: She's trying to regulate them.

419
00:23:04,494 --> 00:23:07,595
[SPEAKER_01]: She's basically, again, encouraging parents not to do their job.

420
00:23:08,396 --> 00:23:11,297
[SPEAKER_05]: Which, you know, even though I am a Democrat, I'll admit it.

421
00:23:11,792 --> 00:23:14,354
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't necessarily have to support her on every little thing she does.

422
00:23:14,394 --> 00:23:22,639
[SPEAKER_05]: This is one of those things where I think every senator, Republican, Democrat, and the one independent guy could all be educated on the gaming world a little bit.

423
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,280
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

424
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,361
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I did have that article here.

425
00:23:26,002 --> 00:23:28,524
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be located, I'll go ahead and give the address.

426
00:23:28,844 --> 00:23:37,790
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gr.bolt.com slash articles slash violence slash violence.htm Hey, it has violence in there twice.

427
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:38,390
[SPEAKER_01]: It can't be that bad.

428
00:23:40,634 --> 00:23:44,816
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, this was written by Duke Ferris, who writes on this site.

429
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:46,176
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a game revolution is what it is.

430
00:23:46,196 --> 00:23:53,058
[SPEAKER_05]: So he's basically presenting facts to show that violence has gone down, not up, amongst children.

431
00:23:53,078 --> 00:23:58,720
[SPEAKER_01]: This information that he's reported on here, it's actually a very well-written article, which really surprised me for this site.

432
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,841
[SPEAKER_01]: It's using statistics put out by the U.S.

433
00:24:01,881 --> 00:24:04,302
[SPEAKER_01]: Department of Justice Bureau of Statistics.

434
00:24:04,982 --> 00:24:09,123
[SPEAKER_01]: and information also pulled from the files of the FBI, public files.

435
00:24:10,724 --> 00:24:23,867
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, it's showing that since right before the release of the PlayStation, we've got basically a mark showing from 93 on, crime has decreased.

436
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:26,110
[SPEAKER_05]: See, I don't know.

437
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:33,814
[SPEAKER_05]: There's got to be a loophole somewhere because, and now granted, I'm about to say, watching the news every night, you would think the complete opposite to be true.

438
00:24:33,894 --> 00:24:34,314
[SPEAKER_05]: But yes, I know.

439
00:24:34,334 --> 00:24:36,074
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, the news is trying to glamorize us.

440
00:24:36,094 --> 00:24:36,855
[SPEAKER_05]: The news sensationalizes it.

441
00:24:37,195 --> 00:24:37,495
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway.

442
00:24:37,535 --> 00:24:42,217
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, you know, again, they make their money by fooling the public.

443
00:24:44,138 --> 00:24:45,358
[SPEAKER_05]: Here come those emails again.

444
00:24:45,378 --> 00:24:47,339
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, you mean it's not hot outside?

445
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:49,220
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

446
00:24:49,833 --> 00:24:50,614
[SPEAKER_05]: Check out the article.

447
00:24:50,654 --> 00:24:51,714
[SPEAKER_05]: Give the link one more time.

448
00:24:51,854 --> 00:24:53,155
[SPEAKER_05]: Draw your own conclusions from this, guys.

449
00:24:53,175 --> 00:24:53,515
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no.

450
00:24:53,735 --> 00:24:58,939
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, keep in mind, I'm not really talking, you know, your local news is cool, I think.

451
00:24:59,719 --> 00:25:05,543
[SPEAKER_01]: At least, you know, whenever I watch the news here, I don't see anything sensational or anything out of the ordinary.

452
00:25:05,603 --> 00:25:10,766
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm talking about, like, they pick one instance, and then it's all on CNN.

453
00:25:10,966 --> 00:25:14,028
[SPEAKER_05]: You're talking about, like, MSNBC doing the Michael Jackson trial 24-7.

454
00:25:14,648 --> 00:25:15,508
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

455
00:25:15,748 --> 00:25:16,589
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that I can agree with.

456
00:25:16,629 --> 00:25:27,132
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like they take one issue, blow it way out of proportion until suddenly the entire public thinks every kid who ever plays a video game is going to come cut off my head in my sleep.

457
00:25:28,012 --> 00:25:31,013
[SPEAKER_01]: Lord have mercy, we all is going to die from GTA.

458
00:25:31,954 --> 00:25:32,394
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that.

459
00:25:33,214 --> 00:25:36,695
[SPEAKER_04]: Which I'm sure you're going to talk about the grandma.

460
00:25:37,516 --> 00:25:38,936
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, I'll bring up grandma in a minute.

461
00:25:39,904 --> 00:25:40,144
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

462
00:25:40,645 --> 00:25:40,965
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead.

463
00:25:41,305 --> 00:25:42,646
[SPEAKER_01]: There was one other thing in here.

464
00:25:44,868 --> 00:25:57,378
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's basically one of the charts on here, which is what I would like to show to most of our listeners, is that there is a very good chart on here that separates everything by age, by age group.

465
00:25:57,978 --> 00:26:02,982
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually in the group, the biggest decline in violent crime was between the 14 and 17 year old group.

466
00:26:05,494 --> 00:26:05,935
[SPEAKER_05]: It's wow.

467
00:26:06,115 --> 00:26:07,796
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, well, give the link one more time.

468
00:26:07,936 --> 00:26:09,157
[SPEAKER_05]: Let folks draw their own conclusions.

469
00:26:09,517 --> 00:26:09,977
[SPEAKER_01]: Give them the article.

470
00:26:10,058 --> 00:26:17,603
[SPEAKER_01]: It's dr.bolt.com slash articles slash violence slash violence.htm And I'll go ahead at some point... Post that in our forums.

471
00:26:18,023 --> 00:26:22,286
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, actually, we'll repeat a link to the article on our announcements on the website.

472
00:26:22,646 --> 00:26:23,327
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds good.

473
00:26:24,221 --> 00:26:25,682
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, did you still want me to read the next letter?

474
00:26:25,922 --> 00:26:26,242
[SPEAKER_05]: Good point.

475
00:26:26,363 --> 00:26:32,207
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I got an email here from Justin M, and this is nice because this is just nothing but an ego inflation letter.

476
00:26:33,267 --> 00:26:39,492
[SPEAKER_05]: I, like many others, discovered your fine podcast through iTunes version 4.9, and I just wanted to let you know that you were doing a wonderful job with it.

477
00:26:39,592 --> 00:26:39,952
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

478
00:26:40,693 --> 00:26:45,976
[SPEAKER_05]: I have heard of Orange Launch Radio before, but didn't have the time to sit down and listen to a live show every week, the shows we do on Sunday night.

479
00:26:47,357 --> 00:26:52,021
[SPEAKER_05]: Having it readily available on my iPod to listen to whenever, I'm ready to just...

480
00:26:54,181 --> 00:26:55,122
[SPEAKER_05]: The grammar gets weird here.

481
00:26:55,642 --> 00:27:01,808
[SPEAKER_05]: Unbelievably huge step in the right direction for talk shows, and it really helps bring out some of the talent that would otherwise lie untapped.

482
00:27:01,848 --> 00:27:04,130
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's quite a compliment.

483
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:05,351
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much for that email.

484
00:27:05,611 --> 00:27:16,240
[SPEAKER_05]: And the most we can ask, get a friend to subscribe to the show, tell one person about the show, and then the news of Orange Lounge spreads everywhere, and we're all happy, and you're happy because you get a new show every week, and et cetera, et cetera.

485
00:27:16,772 --> 00:27:22,857
[SPEAKER_01]: I did want to make a mention that one of our listeners, Michael, thought it was really cool that we were talking about Scorched Earth.

486
00:27:23,297 --> 00:27:25,379
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, Scorched Earth was the game.

487
00:27:25,819 --> 00:27:28,601
[SPEAKER_05]: That was my junior high school lunches for like a year.

488
00:27:28,821 --> 00:27:29,822
[SPEAKER_04]: It is still the game.

489
00:27:30,162 --> 00:27:34,106
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, I'm still waiting for them to finish the PSP homebrew version.

490
00:27:34,126 --> 00:27:35,286
[SPEAKER_05]: They're doing a PSP homebrew version?

491
00:27:35,306 --> 00:27:36,387
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh-huh, they are.

492
00:27:37,048 --> 00:27:38,909
[SPEAKER_05]: I fully endorse the PSP for these reasons.

493
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:41,571
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there was also...

494
00:27:44,777 --> 00:27:50,198
[SPEAKER_01]: One of our Macintosh supporters wrote in, but... I know where this is going, Loki.

495
00:27:52,278 --> 00:27:56,099
[SPEAKER_01]: I forwarded this to Loki earlier.

496
00:27:57,199 --> 00:28:09,201
[SPEAKER_01]: No offense, because I appreciate receiving the email, but when one is speaking of the general intelligence level of a Macintosh user, make sure you use your spell checker and grammar checker before sending your email.

497
00:28:10,061 --> 00:28:13,122
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I counted no less than 15 grammatical and spelling errors.

498
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:15,583
[SPEAKER_05]: That's ironic.

499
00:28:16,083 --> 00:28:16,863
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, just shut up.

500
00:28:16,924 --> 00:28:17,584
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't go there.

501
00:28:18,444 --> 00:28:21,225
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a Max story at the end, and I think it's cool.

502
00:28:21,305 --> 00:28:23,285
[SPEAKER_04]: Listen, I'm not knocking the Max, okay?

503
00:28:23,305 --> 00:28:26,746
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, granted, the processing power may not be what I'm looking for.

504
00:28:27,006 --> 00:28:28,226
[SPEAKER_04]: Their cases look cool, though.

505
00:28:28,346 --> 00:28:28,586
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay?

506
00:28:28,606 --> 00:28:29,547
[SPEAKER_04]: Their cases are nice.

507
00:28:29,647 --> 00:28:31,327
[SPEAKER_01]: Freaking widescreen monitor.

508
00:28:31,347 --> 00:28:31,627
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold on.

509
00:28:31,647 --> 00:28:32,767
[SPEAKER_01]: The monitor is nice.

510
00:28:32,948 --> 00:28:35,408
[SPEAKER_05]: Did we go to Bizarro Orange Lounge Radio?

511
00:28:35,448 --> 00:28:38,369
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I just heard Loki say something nice about a Macintosh.

512
00:28:38,849 --> 00:28:43,996
[SPEAKER_04]: The cases look nice, but that's all they are is just a big graphing calculator inside of a nice case.

513
00:28:44,276 --> 00:28:46,358
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody put a death threat out on you, didn't they?

514
00:28:46,939 --> 00:28:47,159
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

515
00:28:48,121 --> 00:28:52,947
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like I had... You know, when we were conversing about this while I was supposed to be at work...

516
00:28:56,604 --> 00:29:07,914
[SPEAKER_01]: The Mac is a very, I think, best used for either people who are not up to a PC or for the professional needing the specific benefits that a Mac provides.

517
00:29:08,234 --> 00:29:08,854
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me put it this way.

518
00:29:08,874 --> 00:29:17,942
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're going to pick between a Mac, an iMac or whatever, and an eMachine, go with the iMac because eMachines suck even more, and that's pretty bad.

519
00:29:17,982 --> 00:29:19,563
[SPEAKER_04]: That was kind of a nice thing.

520
00:29:19,583 --> 00:29:22,285
[SPEAKER_05]: Make sure you're on there.

521
00:29:22,506 --> 00:29:22,746
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm on.

522
00:29:22,926 --> 00:29:23,006
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh.

523
00:29:23,465 --> 00:29:26,814
[SPEAKER_01]: E-Machines, however, are very good for modifying.

524
00:29:27,356 --> 00:29:28,659
[SPEAKER_01]: They are very easily upgraded.

525
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:28,980
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

526
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,865
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, back to the games.

527
00:29:31,105 --> 00:29:32,329
[SPEAKER_05]: Although I was at the Apple Store today.

528
00:29:33,325 --> 00:29:37,347
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to Fry's and I'm thinking about getting an iMac G5.

529
00:29:37,367 --> 00:29:42,470
[SPEAKER_05]: Just because a regular G5 is freaking expensive.

530
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:46,412
[SPEAKER_01]: And that 30 inch widescreen monitor.

531
00:29:46,712 --> 00:29:47,392
[SPEAKER_05]: I got an email here.

532
00:29:47,432 --> 00:29:48,012
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I read this one?

533
00:29:49,133 --> 00:29:52,134
[SPEAKER_05]: This was somebody who has way too much time on their hands.

534
00:29:52,214 --> 00:29:57,217
[SPEAKER_05]: It's from Cliff R. Cliff sent us an email letting us know our statistics.

535
00:29:57,924 --> 00:29:59,145
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

536
00:30:25,588 --> 00:30:27,109
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't care before, but I do now.

537
00:30:27,289 --> 00:30:27,970
[SPEAKER_05]: That was very cool.

538
00:30:47,701 --> 00:30:55,124
[SPEAKER_01]: Our live show wrote in, DJ Ranma S. Ranchan, in his email, he said this.

539
00:30:55,184 --> 00:30:57,684
[SPEAKER_01]: His 13-year-old cousin got GTA San Andreas for PS2.

540
00:30:58,625 --> 00:31:01,846
[SPEAKER_01]: Now he plays this game all the time and, believe it or not, knows better.

541
00:31:02,266 --> 00:31:04,247
[SPEAKER_01]: The interactions of the game has no effect on him.

542
00:31:04,747 --> 00:31:09,348
[SPEAKER_01]: I say that because his mother and me talk to him all the time about these games, gang's life, and everything else.

543
00:31:09,768 --> 00:31:14,550
[SPEAKER_01]: I admit he does hang out with friends that act more ghetto than CJ at times, but I

544
00:31:16,668 --> 00:31:19,869
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't believe that he doesn't do anything they do.

545
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:21,550
[SPEAKER_01]: And that I was right.

546
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:23,591
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to quote here.

547
00:31:23,671 --> 00:31:27,532
[SPEAKER_01]: Parents, if you're listening to this podcast, your kids need home training.

548
00:31:27,932 --> 00:31:30,633
[SPEAKER_01]: Teach them the difference between real life and fantasy, for God's sake.

549
00:31:31,854 --> 00:31:32,294
[SPEAKER_05]: Well said.

550
00:31:32,414 --> 00:31:35,815
[SPEAKER_05]: I think gamer parents are pretty well aware of that stuff.

551
00:31:35,955 --> 00:31:36,295
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope.

552
00:31:36,435 --> 00:31:36,916
[SPEAKER_05]: I really hope.

553
00:31:37,996 --> 00:31:38,256
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

554
00:31:38,696 --> 00:31:40,897
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going into a new generation of gaming parents.

555
00:31:41,417 --> 00:31:44,478
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember, parents, treat games like they're drugs.

556
00:31:44,699 --> 00:31:45,739
[SPEAKER_04]: Talk to your kids.

557
00:31:46,814 --> 00:31:50,336
[SPEAKER_04]: If you talk to your kids about drugs, they're less likely to do drugs.

558
00:31:50,676 --> 00:31:54,517
[SPEAKER_04]: They're more likely to know the difference between right and wrong if you talk to them.

559
00:31:55,438 --> 00:31:58,379
[SPEAKER_05]: You're in a very nice mood tonight, Loki.

560
00:31:58,839 --> 00:32:00,820
[SPEAKER_05]: You're all about love and affection today.

561
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,860
[SPEAKER_04]: Once we bring up Grandma, it's going downhill.

562
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,541
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I have a hug?

563
00:32:04,021 --> 00:32:05,001
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

564
00:32:05,021 --> 00:32:06,222
[SPEAKER_01]: That made me think of one thing.

565
00:32:06,762 --> 00:32:08,062
[SPEAKER_01]: Where did you learn to do that?

566
00:32:08,142 --> 00:32:08,943
[SPEAKER_01]: I learned it from you!

567
00:32:14,062 --> 00:32:15,263
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I'll talk about Grandma now.

568
00:32:15,343 --> 00:32:15,703
[SPEAKER_05]: Get this.

569
00:32:16,303 --> 00:32:20,945
[SPEAKER_05]: An 85-year-old woman suing Take-Two Entertainment over the hot coffee mod.

570
00:32:21,445 --> 00:32:27,267
[SPEAKER_05]: She purchased the game for her 14-year-old grandson and is now suing Take-Two.

571
00:32:27,507 --> 00:32:29,988
[SPEAKER_05]: This has been passed around on every gaming message board.

572
00:32:30,349 --> 00:32:33,770
[SPEAKER_05]: Surely those of you guys that are checking gaming websites of any capacity have heard about this.

573
00:32:34,611 --> 00:32:40,354
[SPEAKER_05]: and you probably just went, WTF lady, why were you buying this game for your 14 year old kid in the first place?

574
00:32:40,414 --> 00:32:51,760
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, that's another case of a person in a parental position not doing their research and not doing their goddamn job.

575
00:32:53,441 --> 00:32:56,603
[SPEAKER_05]: And she's got some balls to be suing Take-Two Entertainment over it too.

576
00:32:56,623 --> 00:32:57,223
[SPEAKER_01]: She's gonna lose.

577
00:32:58,084 --> 00:33:00,085
[SPEAKER_01]: She bought the game and gave it.

578
00:33:00,698 --> 00:33:05,900
[SPEAKER_01]: If she did not want offensive material to be put in the hands of a child, she would have done her research, don't you think?

579
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:08,541
[SPEAKER_05]: But what she's saying is that now the game is A-O.

580
00:33:08,641 --> 00:33:10,402
[SPEAKER_05]: She wasn't fully educated before.

581
00:33:11,263 --> 00:33:11,723
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?

582
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:13,444
[SPEAKER_01]: It still had an M rating on it.

583
00:33:13,464 --> 00:33:14,524
[SPEAKER_05]: Just playing devil's advocate here.

584
00:33:15,324 --> 00:33:16,625
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to say I disagree with you people.

585
00:33:16,645 --> 00:33:17,445
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just playing devil's advocate.

586
00:33:17,465 --> 00:33:18,806
[SPEAKER_01]: It still had an M rating on it.

587
00:33:18,826 --> 00:33:19,446
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, damn it.

588
00:33:19,506 --> 00:33:22,367
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought that game was rated R, not NC-17.

589
00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:23,188
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell?

590
00:33:23,628 --> 00:33:24,808
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, listen, Grandma.

591
00:33:24,988 --> 00:33:28,270
[SPEAKER_04]: First off, okay, I know you might have watered in there, you know, because...

592
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:32,212
[SPEAKER_04]: You didn't know where you were and you might have bought this game for your grandson.

593
00:33:32,232 --> 00:33:35,134
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'm thinking the grandson probably begged her to buy it.

594
00:33:35,594 --> 00:33:37,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so she bought the game.

595
00:33:38,116 --> 00:33:43,620
[SPEAKER_04]: Did it say in the article that he figured out how to unlock the hot coffee mod content?

596
00:33:46,514 --> 00:33:47,275
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it did not.

597
00:33:47,395 --> 00:33:50,997
[SPEAKER_04]: It specifically said because she found out that that content was in there.

598
00:33:51,358 --> 00:33:56,561
[SPEAKER_04]: Therefore, we could say that he may not have been exposed to this content at all.

599
00:33:57,122 --> 00:33:59,023
[SPEAKER_04]: So, she's retarded.

600
00:33:59,944 --> 00:34:01,405
[SPEAKER_04]: She is friggin' retarded.

601
00:34:02,486 --> 00:34:04,127
[SPEAKER_01]: She has no legal precedent either way.

602
00:34:04,387 --> 00:34:07,469
[SPEAKER_01]: Her lawyer's not going to try to dissuade her because her lawyer's still going to make his money.

603
00:34:09,390 --> 00:34:09,951
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving on.

604
00:34:10,219 --> 00:34:11,241
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, you have a story on this one.

605
00:34:11,261 --> 00:34:12,623
[SPEAKER_05]: A blind teenager from Lincoln, Nebraska, who...

606
00:34:26,284 --> 00:34:29,205
[SPEAKER_01]: can kick anybody's butt at Mortal Kombat, basically.

607
00:34:29,725 --> 00:34:36,187
[SPEAKER_01]: Although I think this article is pretty stupid just because they talk about decapitations in Soul Calibur that don't happen.

608
00:34:36,208 --> 00:34:42,110
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the first thing I noticed in the article, too, that made me kind of go, stupid media person, do your research before you talk about games.

609
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:44,670
[SPEAKER_05]: They talk about decapitation in Soul Calibur, which doesn't happen.

610
00:34:45,111 --> 00:34:53,213
[SPEAKER_05]: This guy probably thought that Soul Calibur, that the reporter must have been blind, too, because apparently Soul Calibur 2 and Mortal Kombat Deadly Alliance are the same game.

611
00:34:53,233 --> 00:34:54,174
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

612
00:34:55,840 --> 00:35:00,162
[SPEAKER_01]: But at any rate, it sounds like he just learned by trial and error how to play.

613
00:35:02,163 --> 00:35:04,043
[SPEAKER_01]: People would correct him when he did something wrong.

614
00:35:04,063 --> 00:35:07,024
[SPEAKER_01]: His favorite thing, he wants to be a video game designer when he graduates.

615
00:35:07,925 --> 00:35:09,986
[SPEAKER_01]: Which, you know, I could see happening.

616
00:35:11,166 --> 00:35:12,086
[SPEAKER_01]: No pun intended.

617
00:35:12,346 --> 00:35:16,168
[SPEAKER_01]: He plays facing away from the screen.

618
00:35:17,648 --> 00:35:21,350
[SPEAKER_01]: People challenge him strictly on his blindness and he still kicks their butt.

619
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:31,333
[SPEAKER_01]: Which I can actually understand that if you understand the timing of your attacks, know who you're using, and hear the reaction on screen, there shouldn't be any reason.

620
00:35:31,353 --> 00:35:32,493
[SPEAKER_05]: I challenge you on mute.

621
00:35:33,033 --> 00:35:37,494
[SPEAKER_05]: But still, but still, a heck of an accomplishment.

622
00:35:37,594 --> 00:35:41,055
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, even though we could kind of think about, okay, this is probably how he does it still.

623
00:35:41,675 --> 00:35:44,856
[SPEAKER_05]: What a lot of time and patience and discipline to become that good at a game.

624
00:35:44,936 --> 00:35:46,036
[SPEAKER_05]: So, hats off to this guy.

625
00:35:46,056 --> 00:35:48,497
[SPEAKER_01]: Apparently he enjoys freaking people out by playing backwards.

626
00:35:48,991 --> 00:35:49,431
[SPEAKER_05]: That's cool.

627
00:35:49,692 --> 00:35:51,053
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we play him on Xbox Live?

628
00:35:51,073 --> 00:35:53,234
[SPEAKER_05]: Does it have a screen tag, gamer tag on there?

629
00:35:53,334 --> 00:35:54,215
[SPEAKER_01]: This is on Yahoo News.

630
00:35:54,395 --> 00:35:54,515
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah.

631
00:35:55,656 --> 00:36:00,340
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, if he happens to be listening to, you know, his, what's his name, Bryce?

632
00:36:01,164 --> 00:36:06,987
[SPEAKER_01]: If he is listening to this podcast, or if anyone who's listening to this podcast knows him, we would love to interview him.

633
00:36:07,467 --> 00:36:07,867
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.

634
00:36:08,248 --> 00:36:10,088
[SPEAKER_01]: And we would love to challenge him on Xbox Live.

635
00:36:10,269 --> 00:36:10,769
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.

636
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:11,769
[SPEAKER_05]: To DDR.

637
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:13,090
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just kidding.

638
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:13,470
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kidding.

639
00:36:14,671 --> 00:36:15,491
[SPEAKER_05]: I have the Mortal Kombat game.

640
00:36:15,511 --> 00:36:15,971
[SPEAKER_05]: We could play that.

641
00:36:16,612 --> 00:36:17,092
[SPEAKER_05]: Or Halo.

642
00:36:17,692 --> 00:36:19,193
[SPEAKER_05]: Anybody can beat my ass in Halo.

643
00:36:19,233 --> 00:36:20,914
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, I had an 8-year-old kid blow me away the other day.

644
00:36:20,934 --> 00:36:22,134
[SPEAKER_00]: He's holding an Xbox controller.

645
00:36:22,835 --> 00:36:23,955
[SPEAKER_00]: I see an Xbox on the floor.

646
00:36:23,975 --> 00:36:24,275
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

647
00:36:24,856 --> 00:36:25,116
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

648
00:36:26,297 --> 00:36:28,837
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving on, another news story coming up here.

649
00:36:29,518 --> 00:36:33,958
[SPEAKER_05]: G4ia, that big video games award show that happens on G4 every year.

650
00:36:34,078 --> 00:36:38,759
[SPEAKER_05]: It is going to air on August 9th, but that doesn't mean we won't ruin it for you right now.

651
00:36:39,319 --> 00:36:40,780
[SPEAKER_05]: The game of the year was Halo 2.

652
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:44,781
[SPEAKER_05]: Favorite character was the Kratos in God of War.

653
00:36:45,241 --> 00:36:47,881
[SPEAKER_05]: EB Gamer's Choice Award went to World of Warcraft.

654
00:36:49,201 --> 00:36:50,862
[SPEAKER_05]: Did Katamari Damacy win anything?

655
00:36:51,162 --> 00:36:51,402
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

656
00:36:51,622 --> 00:36:52,462
[SPEAKER_05]: Best innovation?

657
00:36:53,354 --> 00:36:53,974
[SPEAKER_05]: That one game.

658
00:36:54,214 --> 00:36:56,055
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see how many awards Halo 2 got.

659
00:36:56,515 --> 00:37:06,458
[SPEAKER_05]: Best Boss, Best Multiplayer Game, Best Original Soundtrack, Best Shooter, Best Sound Design, Best Voice Performance, and Game of the Year.

660
00:37:06,618 --> 00:37:08,239
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a Halo 2 whoring fest.

661
00:37:08,259 --> 00:37:12,240
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and other than Licensed Soundtrack, where's the love for Grand Theft Auto?

662
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:13,241
[SPEAKER_04]: That game was at the top.

663
00:37:13,361 --> 00:37:14,761
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still at the top of the charts.

664
00:37:15,161 --> 00:37:17,682
[SPEAKER_04]: And all the guys, Best Licensed Soundtrack.

665
00:37:17,702 --> 00:37:19,823
[SPEAKER_04]: Best Licensed Soundtrack was the only award that came out.

666
00:37:19,863 --> 00:37:20,303
[SPEAKER_04]: Lame!

667
00:37:21,798 --> 00:37:22,738
[SPEAKER_04]: Lame, lame, lame.

668
00:37:22,778 --> 00:37:24,959
[SPEAKER_04]: Halo was just another first-person shooter.

669
00:37:25,499 --> 00:37:28,400
[SPEAKER_04]: Grand Theft Auto San Andreas was a revolution.

670
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:33,102
[SPEAKER_05]: There's tons of emails coming your way that are going to disagree with you on that.

671
00:37:33,842 --> 00:37:36,343
[SPEAKER_05]: Personally, I actually enjoy Halo 2 more than Grand Theft Auto.

672
00:37:36,623 --> 00:37:36,883
[SPEAKER_05]: I do.

673
00:37:37,543 --> 00:37:42,345
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the multiplayer party aspect of it makes it, for me, a more fun game.

674
00:37:43,635 --> 00:37:46,016
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, you have any other news stories for us tonight?

675
00:37:46,056 --> 00:37:46,096
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

676
00:38:10,169 --> 00:38:16,194
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually... A game that's coming out shortly, and I'm actually trying to get the US release date, because I know it's coming out very soon.

677
00:38:16,955 --> 00:38:19,657
[SPEAKER_01]: Fire Emblem Path of Radiance is coming out.

678
00:38:19,697 --> 00:38:23,460
[SPEAKER_01]: My fiancé has just been pissing his pants waiting for this to come out.

679
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:24,240
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for that visual.

680
00:38:24,901 --> 00:38:25,221
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

681
00:38:25,661 --> 00:38:29,605
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, he's been even downloading... Because we were very disappointed when...

682
00:38:30,512 --> 00:38:35,076
[SPEAKER_01]: You know the Fire Emblem on Game Boy Advance that had Marth and Roy in it?

683
00:38:35,297 --> 00:38:36,218
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't come out over here.

684
00:38:36,538 --> 00:38:41,423
[SPEAKER_01]: But the one after that did, which actually is a prequel to that, and then the one following came out.

685
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:47,972
[SPEAKER_01]: Dan's just really been into Fire Emblem, and it actually may be the first strategy game that I might actually give a serious chance.

686
00:38:48,452 --> 00:39:01,515
[SPEAKER_01]: The last one I played was the Macross game on the PC Engine, which... Anyway, but Fire Emblem, Path of Radiance is coming out to GameCube, and I was checking out the UK news, and of course I saw that, I instantly went to it.

687
00:39:02,315 --> 00:39:04,936
[SPEAKER_01]: Path of Radiance has a November release date.

688
00:39:05,256 --> 00:39:08,437
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have the specific date, but it's said to come out this November.

689
00:39:09,398 --> 00:39:11,440
[SPEAKER_01]: Loki, what's going on in the hack and crack world right now?

690
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:32,848
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of stuff, especially with people getting their panties in a bunch over version 2.0 of the firmware for PSP.

691
00:39:33,609 --> 00:39:39,873
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got a brand new homebrew version of a web browser that's actually been released right now.

692
00:39:39,913 --> 00:39:41,634
[SPEAKER_04]: Now there's four options for web browsing.

693
00:39:42,455 --> 00:39:46,778
[SPEAKER_04]: This one is called actually the 2CH browser.

694
00:39:47,118 --> 00:39:52,401
[SPEAKER_04]: And really the first version of it can only visit the site 2ch.jp or some Japanese site.

695
00:39:53,612 --> 00:39:54,554
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

696
00:40:02,703 --> 00:40:06,926
[SPEAKER_04]: Snuff with the 2.0 browser, which actually supports Java and downloads and whatnot.

697
00:40:07,706 --> 00:40:08,367
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's pretty cool.

698
00:40:09,207 --> 00:40:16,772
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, one of the really cool games that came out this week for the PSP Homebrew was actually a port of Super Smash Bros.

699
00:40:17,013 --> 00:40:17,453
[SPEAKER_04]: No way.

700
00:40:17,813 --> 00:40:18,073
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

701
00:40:18,373 --> 00:40:19,174
[SPEAKER_04]: Super Smash Bros.

702
00:40:19,254 --> 00:40:22,556
[SPEAKER_04]: GP, which was actually for the console GP32.

703
00:40:22,936 --> 00:40:28,700
[SPEAKER_04]: They made it for that portable system, but now they've ported it and you can put your own characters in there.

704
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:31,222
[SPEAKER_05]: Does it look like the GameCube one, though?

705
00:40:33,484 --> 00:40:34,685
[SPEAKER_05]: It has the look and feel.

706
00:40:34,745 --> 00:40:35,926
[SPEAKER_04]: It has the feel of it.

707
00:40:36,046 --> 00:40:40,289
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not exactly the same detail and look, but hey, homebrew, come on.

708
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:41,731
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still fun.

709
00:40:43,312 --> 00:40:44,653
[SPEAKER_04]: So that came out.

710
00:40:46,081 --> 00:40:56,827
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Sony is letting everyone know not to upgrade your US PlayStation portables to the 2.0 because that's meant for only Japanese PlayStations and it could harm your PlayStation and turn into a brick.

711
00:40:56,987 --> 00:40:57,748
[SPEAKER_05]: Will that stop you?

712
00:40:57,868 --> 00:40:58,208
[SPEAKER_04]: No!

713
00:40:58,508 --> 00:40:59,509
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that won't stop people.

714
00:40:59,569 --> 00:41:05,172
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyways, as far as the DS stuff goes here, there's been a few things being worked on.

715
00:41:05,192 --> 00:41:07,693
[SPEAKER_04]: A brand new Super Nintendo player for it.

716
00:41:07,893 --> 00:41:13,576
[SPEAKER_04]: But honestly, emulation on the DS is tough, especially when you have to get all those external cards and whatnot.

717
00:41:15,585 --> 00:41:17,386
[SPEAKER_04]: Antlion Trooper's Deuce Antlion Trooper's Deuce

718
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:41,702
[SPEAKER_04]: The Cardboard Showdown with Cardboard Tube Samurai

719
00:42:03,061 --> 00:42:05,603
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh god, I can't remember what game it's for now.

720
00:42:06,003 --> 00:42:07,184
[SPEAKER_04]: Unreal Tournament, that's right.

721
00:42:07,784 --> 00:42:13,208
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can check this out at ObeyTheTube.com Very cool, very cool.

722
00:42:13,248 --> 00:42:14,648
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for following up on the mods, that's cool.

723
00:42:15,029 --> 00:42:17,470
[SPEAKER_05]: A couple quick news items here, then we're going to get to the advice column.

724
00:42:18,491 --> 00:42:23,434
[SPEAKER_05]: The Matrix Online is going down from nine servers to three.

725
00:42:23,794 --> 00:42:26,196
[SPEAKER_05]: They're scaling back to three servers starting August 2nd.

726
00:42:27,699 --> 00:42:31,160
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, that's probably a sign that it's not doing as well as they thought it would.

727
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:37,701
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they said that the reason why they're scaling back is because there wasn't a lot of players on it one time or whatever, so they're cutting them back.

728
00:42:38,061 --> 00:42:41,622
[SPEAKER_04]: Two of the servers are going to be standard servers, one of them is going to be a PvP server.

729
00:42:41,862 --> 00:42:48,803
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of sad to hear that Matrix Online, or the Matrix franchise in general has just been going downhill.

730
00:42:48,823 --> 00:42:56,165
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I don't know, maybe their servers can handle more people, and so they want more people cramped into the city, because the city was huge, so it might just be the world's too big.

731
00:42:56,701 --> 00:42:56,781
[SPEAKER_05]: D.D.R.

732
00:43:23,408 --> 00:43:24,829
[SPEAKER_05]: Namco Museum 50th Anniversary Arcade Collection

733
00:43:46,625 --> 00:43:47,246
[SPEAKER_05]: to go with this game.

734
00:43:47,266 --> 00:44:02,454
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to license Come On Eileen, Loverboy's Working for the Weekend, Fine Young Cannibals, She Drives Me Crazy, The Romantics with Talking in Your Sleep, and Daz Band's Joystick are just some of the titles that are being announced for the upcoming Namco Museum.

735
00:44:02,554 --> 00:44:04,735
[SPEAKER_05]: And by the way, Namco Museum is going to be a budget title.

736
00:44:04,775 --> 00:44:06,156
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be out for only $19.95.

737
00:44:08,337 --> 00:44:12,519
[SPEAKER_05]: But my question... Where's Pac-Man Fever in all of this?

738
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:14,380
[SPEAKER_05]: Where is it?

739
00:44:16,258 --> 00:44:18,440
[SPEAKER_05]: The quintessential Namco 80s tune, come on people.

740
00:44:20,622 --> 00:44:22,304
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yes, let's get to the one and only.

741
00:44:22,464 --> 00:44:37,539
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, speaking of Namco, there was a 7-Up commercial in the 80s where someone was playing Pac-Man and it played this song that sounds almost like Betty Davis' eyes, except it's Pac-Man chasing the ghost, stopping, getting all out of breath, dehydrated, and drinking a 7-Up on screen.

742
00:44:39,145 --> 00:44:41,426
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you download that on one of those retro commercial websites?

743
00:44:42,006 --> 00:44:47,289
[SPEAKER_01]: I think so, but I think my fiance has it on his computer, which is still not hooked up because our house is still being unpacked.

744
00:44:47,949 --> 00:44:50,811
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I can, I'll try to rip the audio out of it.

745
00:44:51,011 --> 00:44:51,451
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be cool.

746
00:44:52,311 --> 00:44:52,752
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

747
00:44:53,412 --> 00:44:58,654
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, we here at Orange Lounge Radio, we're not just here to talk about video games all day long, which should be pretty evident tonight.

748
00:44:59,175 --> 00:45:01,396
[SPEAKER_05]: But we're here to better your lives as well.

749
00:45:02,016 --> 00:45:08,159
[SPEAKER_05]: Because if we stayed home and played video games all day long, we'd have no time to go out and film commercials.

750
00:45:09,554 --> 00:45:11,315
[SPEAKER_05]: Which we've never done, but I just thought I'd throw that out there.

751
00:45:11,575 --> 00:45:12,115
[SPEAKER_05]: We were willing to.

752
00:45:12,695 --> 00:45:14,196
[SPEAKER_01]: It was nicer than what I was thinking.

753
00:45:15,056 --> 00:45:15,636
[SPEAKER_05]: What were you thinking?

754
00:45:17,337 --> 00:45:17,637
[SPEAKER_05]: Forget it.

755
00:45:19,638 --> 00:45:21,698
[SPEAKER_05]: It's DarkSakura's advice column, you know it by now.

756
00:45:21,718 --> 00:45:23,039
[SPEAKER_05]: What are you going to talk to us about tonight?

757
00:45:24,019 --> 00:45:27,340
[SPEAKER_01]: Tonight's bit of advice is how to escape from a sinking car.

758
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:28,201
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

759
00:45:29,521 --> 00:45:32,702
[SPEAKER_01]: This is like if you happen to drive your car off into the river or something.

760
00:45:34,303 --> 00:45:34,883
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one.

761
00:45:35,589 --> 00:45:37,510
[SPEAKER_01]: Open the window as soon as possible.

762
00:45:38,050 --> 00:45:40,891
[SPEAKER_01]: Opening the window allows water to come in and equalize the pressure.

763
00:45:41,912 --> 00:45:40,891
2.

764
00:45:42,412 --> 00:45:44,553
[SPEAKER_01]: If you cannot roll your windows down, break the glass.

765
00:45:44,673 --> 00:45:52,536
[SPEAKER_01]: Use your foot, shoulder, or heavy objects such as an anti-theft steering wheel lock, the club, the cops say use it, to escape from your car when it's underwater.

766
00:45:52,777 --> 00:45:53,137
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

767
00:45:53,877 --> 00:45:53,137
3.

768
00:45:54,617 --> 00:45:55,678
[SPEAKER_01]: Get out as soon as you can.

769
00:45:56,178 --> 00:45:59,359
[SPEAKER_01]: Floating time will range from a few seconds to a few minutes.

770
00:45:59,379 --> 00:45:59,359
4.

771
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:05,082
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are unable to open the window or break it, wait until the car fills with water.

772
00:46:05,916 --> 00:46:08,537
[SPEAKER_01]: When the water level reaches your head, take a deep breath and hold it.

773
00:46:08,918 --> 00:46:13,220
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the pressure should be equalized inside and outside, and you should be able to open the door and swim to the surface.

774
00:46:15,081 --> 00:46:22,385
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, my number one thing is, you know, you know, don't drive after having that adios motherfucker.

775
00:46:23,966 --> 00:46:24,826
[SPEAKER_01]: I had one of those.

776
00:46:25,486 --> 00:46:26,607
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't drive after that.

777
00:46:27,387 --> 00:46:28,528
[SPEAKER_01]: You will end up in the bay.

778
00:46:28,948 --> 00:46:34,251
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, don't drive into the bay, people, unless you're playing Driver 3, because that's about the only fun thing to do in that game.

779
00:46:34,987 --> 00:46:41,474
[SPEAKER_01]: And just in, I should go ahead and now, since it's very obvious that I have a source for my advice.

780
00:46:43,155 --> 00:46:46,879
[SPEAKER_01]: The Worst Case Scenario Survival Handbook is a wonderful thing.

781
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:54,046
[SPEAKER_01]: It teaches you all kinds of ways to keep from getting trapped in an elevator and controlling runaway camels.

782
00:46:54,522 --> 00:46:54,902
[SPEAKER_05]: Very nice.

783
00:46:54,962 --> 00:46:56,103
[SPEAKER_05]: They sell a calendar or something?

784
00:46:56,363 --> 00:46:57,024
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a calendar.

785
00:46:57,224 --> 00:46:59,325
[SPEAKER_05]: We should really plug them so they don't sue you.

786
00:46:59,565 --> 00:47:02,907
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've been getting my advice, but this is all stuff I knew anyway.

787
00:47:04,548 --> 00:47:04,848
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

788
00:47:05,469 --> 00:47:08,751
[SPEAKER_01]: You never know when you have to cross a piranha-infested river, okay?

789
00:47:09,269 --> 00:47:10,830
[SPEAKER_01]: or Navigate a Minefield.

790
00:47:10,930 --> 00:47:15,975
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to laugh one of these days when someone actually... I was on this runaway camel and you saved my life.

791
00:47:16,115 --> 00:47:17,336
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Orange Lounge.

792
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:24,562
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I'm waiting for the podcast alley votes this month because we usually have a couple people that leave these smart-ass comments that say, like, Orange Lounge taught me how to have a baby.

793
00:47:24,882 --> 00:47:27,004
[SPEAKER_05]: And, like, all these crazy things, which is cool.

794
00:47:27,024 --> 00:47:30,967
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm looking forward to seeing those types of things come up this next month when people can vote again.

795
00:47:31,208 --> 00:47:32,189
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, vote for us.

796
00:47:32,889 --> 00:47:33,089
[SPEAKER_05]: Vote.

797
00:47:33,990 --> 00:47:34,891
[SPEAKER_01]: Every second.

798
00:47:35,683 --> 00:47:36,263
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving on.

799
00:47:37,344 --> 00:47:39,125
[SPEAKER_05]: Rumble Roses XX.

800
00:47:39,985 --> 00:47:40,585
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

801
00:47:40,866 --> 00:47:44,007
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a sequel to Rumble Roses and it's coming out on the Xbox 360.

802
00:47:44,147 --> 00:47:45,688
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm.

803
00:47:46,088 --> 00:47:49,030
[SPEAKER_05]: Why didn't they call this Rumble Roses XXXG?

804
00:47:49,130 --> 00:47:50,850
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me think about this one for a little bit.

805
00:47:51,030 --> 00:47:52,991
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that's basically what it will be.

806
00:47:54,697 --> 00:47:55,778
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw pictures.

807
00:47:56,238 --> 00:47:56,899
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty.

808
00:47:57,119 --> 00:47:58,360
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be customizable.

809
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:01,001
[SPEAKER_05]: None of the existing characters will be replaced.

810
00:48:01,401 --> 00:48:06,125
[SPEAKER_05]: Fans of the series should check out changes to the known roster before inquiring about new characters.

811
00:48:06,185 --> 00:48:09,367
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're going to kind of change, but none of the characters are leaving, supposedly.

812
00:48:09,387 --> 00:48:10,768
[SPEAKER_05]: So it should be very interesting.

813
00:48:11,148 --> 00:48:12,609
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs customizable characters.

814
00:48:12,909 --> 00:48:16,191
[SPEAKER_05]: They're saying, though, that they're not thinking about mud wrestling.

815
00:48:16,251 --> 00:48:18,613
[SPEAKER_05]: They want to do something else that's stunning.

816
00:48:18,793 --> 00:48:19,994
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess they haven't thought of it yet.

817
00:48:20,014 --> 00:48:20,114
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

818
00:48:21,054 --> 00:48:21,795
[SPEAKER_05]: Cream Corn!

819
00:48:21,815 --> 00:48:22,995
[SPEAKER_05]: Cream Corn!

820
00:48:23,495 --> 00:48:24,396
[SPEAKER_05]: Kids, Cream Corn.

821
00:48:25,576 --> 00:48:26,697
[SPEAKER_04]: Braun Panty Match.

822
00:48:27,878 --> 00:48:29,398
[SPEAKER_05]: Wasn't that what the whole game was?

823
00:48:30,239 --> 00:48:33,700
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, it's a completely different side of the spectrum here.

824
00:48:34,081 --> 00:48:41,864
[SPEAKER_05]: WB Interactive will be putting out a game on consoles and PC, and it's called Friends, the one with all the trivia.

825
00:48:42,205 --> 00:48:46,207
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right, it's a game dedicated to Friends trivia.

826
00:48:46,307 --> 00:48:47,187
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I saw this.

827
00:48:48,488 --> 00:48:48,888
[SPEAKER_05]: It's sad.

828
00:48:50,546 --> 00:48:52,347
[SPEAKER_01]: Joey is your best friend.

829
00:48:52,627 --> 00:48:53,127
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving on.

830
00:48:53,167 --> 00:48:55,589
[SPEAKER_01]: You will make him a ham sandwich every morning.

831
00:48:55,609 --> 00:48:57,009
[SPEAKER_05]: Please watch Joey.

832
00:48:57,130 --> 00:48:58,650
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody, please watch it.

833
00:48:58,830 --> 00:49:01,572
[SPEAKER_01]: And buy him hundreds of dollars in pants.

834
00:49:02,993 --> 00:49:06,895
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, that's the only episode I remember was the Subliminal Message episode.

835
00:49:07,055 --> 00:49:08,155
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember Smelly Cat.

836
00:49:08,175 --> 00:49:08,636
[SPEAKER_05]: That's about it.

837
00:49:08,716 --> 00:49:10,457
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't want to give that show any more time on this show.

838
00:49:12,222 --> 00:49:12,762
[SPEAKER_05]: Midway!

839
00:49:12,882 --> 00:49:15,003
[SPEAKER_05]: Midway's putting out a sequel to The Suffering.

840
00:49:15,063 --> 00:49:18,605
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a sequel to the popular shooter called The Suffering, The Ties That Bind.

841
00:49:18,905 --> 00:49:23,087
[SPEAKER_05]: And they just wanted to let you all know that they landed some major Hollywood talent to be doing the voice acting.

842
00:49:23,467 --> 00:49:24,928
[SPEAKER_05]: Michael Clarke Duncan.

843
00:49:25,268 --> 00:49:28,589
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember that guy who was in The Green Mile and The Planet of the Apes and Daredevil?

844
00:49:28,889 --> 00:49:31,410
[SPEAKER_05]: He will be doing a villainous character in the game.

845
00:49:32,011 --> 00:49:39,914
[SPEAKER_05]: And Rachel Griffiths, who is in Six Feet Under and Hillary and Jackie and probably nobody that listens to this show remembers this movie, but I remember her at Muriel's wedding.

846
00:49:40,838 --> 00:49:43,059
[SPEAKER_05]: She's going to be doing a role in this as well.

847
00:49:43,139 --> 00:49:45,761
[SPEAKER_05]: So some big Hollywood talent coming to The Suffering.

848
00:49:45,941 --> 00:49:51,324
[SPEAKER_04]: Might add also The Suffering starts in three different ways depending on how you ended the first game.

849
00:49:52,885 --> 00:49:56,007
[SPEAKER_05]: Or The Suffering starts if you choose to buy a Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen game instead.

850
00:49:57,788 --> 00:49:58,208
[SPEAKER_05]: Bad joke.

851
00:49:58,228 --> 00:49:59,428
[SPEAKER_05]: Forget it.

852
00:49:59,468 --> 00:50:01,109
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, you had another story for us?

853
00:50:02,150 --> 00:50:02,750
[SPEAKER_01]: I sure do.

854
00:50:04,531 --> 00:50:06,392
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually wanted Yahoo!

855
00:50:06,512 --> 00:50:09,254
[SPEAKER_01]: UK put up the top 100 computer games of all time.

856
00:50:09,990 --> 00:50:10,571
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, very interesting.

857
00:50:10,591 --> 00:50:13,313
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, now we don't have time to read all 100, but... But I'll give you the top 10.

858
00:50:13,393 --> 00:50:14,253
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, top 10 works.

859
00:50:14,774 --> 00:50:21,199
[SPEAKER_01]: Number 10, Elite for the BBC Micro, which is a system I need to get because I don't have one anymore.

860
00:50:21,319 --> 00:50:22,820
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope I will have heard of some of these games.

861
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:24,961
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, UK listeners, I just don't know that one.

862
00:50:25,001 --> 00:50:25,802
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very Vectory.

863
00:50:26,142 --> 00:50:26,402
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

864
00:50:26,843 --> 00:50:29,805
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we have GoldenEye 007 for the Nintendo 64.

865
00:50:29,845 --> 00:50:30,526
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that one.

866
00:50:30,726 --> 00:50:33,228
[SPEAKER_01]: That game makes me violently motion sick.

867
00:50:33,368 --> 00:50:35,389
[SPEAKER_05]: But for shooter fans, great game.

868
00:50:36,290 --> 00:50:39,072
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a great game, but it did make me violently motion sick.

869
00:50:39,847 --> 00:50:41,688
[SPEAKER_01]: Next up, we have Street Fighter 2.

870
00:50:43,129 --> 00:50:44,070
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, definitely.

871
00:50:44,090 --> 00:50:44,610
[SPEAKER_01]: Arcade version.

872
00:50:44,710 --> 00:50:46,311
[SPEAKER_05]: Revolutionized arcades, absolutely.

873
00:50:46,951 --> 00:50:49,493
[SPEAKER_01]: Super Mario Kart for the Super Nintendo.

874
00:50:50,494 --> 00:50:51,114
[SPEAKER_05]: Old favorite of mine.

875
00:50:51,194 --> 00:50:51,414
[SPEAKER_05]: Love it.

876
00:50:52,275 --> 00:50:54,876
[SPEAKER_01]: Monkey Island 2, LeChuck's Revenge for the PC.

877
00:50:55,156 --> 00:50:55,537
[SPEAKER_05]: Hell yeah.

878
00:50:55,697 --> 00:50:57,378
[SPEAKER_05]: That's an interesting one to have in the top ten.

879
00:50:57,458 --> 00:50:59,739
[SPEAKER_05]: A good choice, but that's kind of like that.

880
00:50:59,879 --> 00:51:00,760
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's number five.

881
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:01,740
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, what else?

882
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:05,262
[SPEAKER_01]: Number four, Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time for the Nintendo 64.

883
00:51:05,342 --> 00:51:05,563
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

884
00:51:07,225 --> 00:51:10,507
[SPEAKER_05]: I know the hate mail is going to come in, but Ocarina of Time was not as great of a game as everybody says.

885
00:51:10,527 --> 00:51:10,948
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it was.

886
00:51:11,228 --> 00:51:12,068
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it wasn't.

887
00:51:12,409 --> 00:51:15,050
[SPEAKER_05]: The Super Nintendo one was leaps and bounds better, in my opinion.

888
00:51:15,431 --> 00:51:17,993
[SPEAKER_05]: But maybe I just can't get the 3D Zelda thing.

889
00:51:18,053 --> 00:51:18,913
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

890
00:51:18,953 --> 00:51:19,814
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I apologize.

891
00:51:19,834 --> 00:51:20,594
[SPEAKER_01]: That one was number five.

892
00:51:20,894 --> 00:51:21,355
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, sorry.

893
00:51:21,915 --> 00:51:23,957
[SPEAKER_01]: And listeners, never mind Rob, because he's on crack.

894
00:51:24,097 --> 00:51:24,357
[SPEAKER_05]: Shut up.

895
00:51:25,338 --> 00:51:25,918
[SPEAKER_05]: Hated it.

896
00:51:26,759 --> 00:51:27,919
[SPEAKER_05]: Super Nintendo one was the best.

897
00:51:27,959 --> 00:51:28,219
[SPEAKER_05]: Shut up.

898
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:28,660
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving on.

899
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:29,701
Number four.

900
00:51:29,821 --> 00:51:32,903
[SPEAKER_01]: Pro Evolution Soccer 4 on the PlayStation 2, put out by Konami.

901
00:51:33,323 --> 00:51:34,644
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoa, soccer and not football?

902
00:51:37,368 --> 00:51:38,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Your mic's going out again.

903
00:51:38,288 --> 00:51:38,909
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what's going on.

904
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:39,129
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

905
00:51:39,389 --> 00:51:42,790
[SPEAKER_01]: Konami published it with Sakura in the title, but it is football.

906
00:51:43,250 --> 00:51:43,510
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

907
00:51:44,990 --> 00:51:47,431
[SPEAKER_01]: Number three, Pokemon Red and Green.

908
00:51:48,931 --> 00:51:49,351
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

909
00:51:49,892 --> 00:51:50,692
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

910
00:51:50,732 --> 00:51:53,092
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a big audience for that, and it reaches a lot of people.

911
00:51:53,413 --> 00:51:54,073
[SPEAKER_01]: Pokey Pokey.

912
00:51:56,213 --> 00:51:56,693
[SPEAKER_05]: Top two.

913
00:51:57,334 --> 00:52:00,254
[SPEAKER_01]: Number two, Super Mario 64 for the Nintendo 64.

914
00:52:01,215 --> 00:52:02,195
[SPEAKER_01]: That game was fun.

915
00:52:02,737 --> 00:52:06,600
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, the most overrated... This is the thing with Nintendo 64 games.

916
00:52:06,741 --> 00:52:09,163
[SPEAKER_05]: Their franchise games were incredibly overrated, in my opinion.

917
00:52:09,203 --> 00:52:10,064
[SPEAKER_05]: Goldeneye was a good game.

918
00:52:10,084 --> 00:52:11,305
[SPEAKER_01]: I like how it's described.

919
00:52:12,165 --> 00:52:16,990
[SPEAKER_01]: It says they're a childhood hero able to go anywhere and do anything to an extent that is purely magical.

920
00:52:18,431 --> 00:52:21,674
[SPEAKER_05]: And doesn't hold a candle to Mario 3, but that's just my big, fat opinion.

921
00:52:23,135 --> 00:52:26,078
[SPEAKER_01]: The number one game of all time... Tetris for the Game Boy.

922
00:52:32,092 --> 00:52:35,473
[SPEAKER_05]: No Pac-Man anywhere in the top ten, which is considered the granddaddy.

923
00:52:35,493 --> 00:52:37,514
[SPEAKER_01]: However, DDR was number 49.

924
00:52:37,934 --> 00:52:38,415
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

925
00:52:39,195 --> 00:52:44,797
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, well, Tetris... And it was right above Afterburner, which I honestly like better than DDR.

926
00:52:44,857 --> 00:52:48,398
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody plays Tetris, so I can't argue with that as the number one choice.

927
00:52:48,419 --> 00:52:48,899
[SPEAKER_05]: I really can't.

928
00:52:49,179 --> 00:52:51,320
[SPEAKER_01]: Tetris is the ultimate game to take on an airplane.

929
00:52:52,060 --> 00:52:52,300
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

930
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:54,521
[SPEAKER_05]: Couple more stories for you guys.

931
00:52:55,652 --> 00:52:55,932
[SPEAKER_05]: Codemasters

932
00:53:10,908 --> 00:53:11,349
[SPEAKER_05]: Carameldansen

933
00:53:32,290 --> 00:53:36,793
[SPEAKER_05]: on the product, and Konami is bringing a good game to the American Idol name.

934
00:53:37,874 --> 00:53:44,959
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, they're not confirming that it's going to be a karaoke revolution marriage, the American Idol game, but come on, what else is it going to be, people?

935
00:53:44,979 --> 00:53:45,939
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be karaoke.

936
00:53:45,979 --> 00:53:47,440
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got to be some type of karaoke.

937
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:51,043
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you're going to see DDR, Think You Can Dance.

938
00:53:51,183 --> 00:53:52,284
[SPEAKER_04]: Please, please, no.

939
00:53:53,465 --> 00:53:54,385
[SPEAKER_05]: End there, end there.

940
00:53:55,006 --> 00:53:55,866
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to happen.

941
00:53:56,226 --> 00:53:59,048
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, and... Wow.

942
00:53:59,769 --> 00:53:59,869
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

943
00:54:01,636 --> 00:54:02,336
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, moving on.

944
00:54:03,497 --> 00:54:04,157
[SPEAKER_05]: Field of Magic.

945
00:54:05,258 --> 00:54:06,399
[SPEAKER_05]: You remember that game on the DS?

946
00:54:06,879 --> 00:54:11,561
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of like a dating sim type game, but it was like WarioWare mixed with Sprung, I guess you could say.

947
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:17,765
[SPEAKER_05]: Field of Magic, even though it wasn't the most hugely popular game, it's actually getting a sequel.

948
00:54:18,425 --> 00:54:23,548
[SPEAKER_05]: Famitsu Magazine mentions that Field of Magic XXYY is going to be getting a sequel.

949
00:54:23,968 --> 00:54:25,249
[SPEAKER_05]: Guess what the sequel is called?

950
00:54:25,749 --> 00:54:27,670
[SPEAKER_05]: This is all we know about the game so far is the name.

951
00:54:28,945 --> 00:54:31,447
[SPEAKER_05]: Akachan wa doko karakuru no?

952
00:54:31,687 --> 00:54:33,809
[SPEAKER_05]: Which means, where do babies come from?

953
00:54:36,431 --> 00:54:39,554
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, yeah.

954
00:54:42,096 --> 00:54:43,237
[SPEAKER_05]: Where do babies come from?

955
00:54:44,018 --> 00:54:44,658
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, um...

956
00:54:49,571 --> 00:54:51,872
[SPEAKER_04]: You got another quick story before I get to tonight's last story?

957
00:54:51,972 --> 00:55:03,599
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I hinted at earlier about the Nintendogs thing, selected members of Nintendo.com who are registered there will receive their copies of Nintendog on August 22nd.

958
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:07,181
[SPEAKER_04]: Or before the August 22nd release date, actually.

959
00:55:07,902 --> 00:55:15,446
[SPEAKER_04]: And rumor is it's probably going to be the people that have the most usage of their forms.

960
00:55:15,606 --> 00:55:17,388
[SPEAKER_04]: Lucky you people.

961
00:55:17,528 --> 00:55:18,068
[SPEAKER_04]: Send me a copy.

962
00:55:19,972 --> 00:55:34,041
[SPEAKER_04]: and also one more thing and it's not too much of a surprise since there's a lot of instant messaging on the Xbox 360 they're going to have a QWERTY controller as well one of those ones with a stupid little keyboard on the bottom fun fun interesting

963
00:55:34,895 --> 00:55:36,596
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, one more story for you guys tonight.

964
00:55:36,656 --> 00:55:37,997
[SPEAKER_05]: I promised you a Mac story.

965
00:55:38,198 --> 00:55:39,038
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's your Mac story.

966
00:55:39,579 --> 00:55:43,602
[SPEAKER_05]: If you are a OSX user, you must check this out.

967
00:55:44,022 --> 00:55:53,249
[SPEAKER_05]: MikeZornik.com, that's M-I-K-E-Z-O-R-N-E-K.com slash Coco, C-O-C-O-A, slash Mega Man Effect.

968
00:55:53,850 --> 00:56:02,697
[SPEAKER_05]: And what this is, this is an application so that when you launch an icon in OSX, it actually does the Mega Man Effect from Mega Man 2.

969
00:56:08,476 --> 00:56:10,417
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's gonna be like, calculator!

970
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:11,218
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

971
00:56:11,418 --> 00:56:17,882
[SPEAKER_05]: So every time you launch an application, the icon comes out, and you get the little Mega Man 2 anthem.

972
00:56:17,942 --> 00:56:21,825
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, that'd be so annoying, but I gotta put, I would totally put that on my computer at home.

973
00:56:22,445 --> 00:56:23,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you saying you're gonna buy a Mac?

974
00:56:23,966 --> 00:56:25,547
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not gonna buy a Mac for that.

975
00:56:25,667 --> 00:56:26,648
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck that, he'll port it.

976
00:56:28,709 --> 00:56:30,591
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, that would be so annoying.

977
00:56:31,471 --> 00:56:32,652
[SPEAKER_04]: They should do that with everything.

978
00:56:32,712 --> 00:56:33,793
[SPEAKER_04]: Hamburger!

979
00:56:33,813 --> 00:56:34,173
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude!

980
00:56:36,701 --> 00:56:37,402
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

981
00:57:01,525 --> 00:57:02,045
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow!

982
00:57:02,325 --> 00:57:03,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, guess what?

983
00:57:03,545 --> 00:57:04,366
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's at the door?

984
00:57:04,686 --> 00:57:05,666
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Pizza Man!

985
00:57:11,787 --> 00:57:12,447
[SPEAKER_05]: Mailman!

986
00:57:12,527 --> 00:57:13,067
[SPEAKER_05]: No!

987
00:57:15,428 --> 00:57:16,008
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, God.

988
00:57:16,228 --> 00:57:16,588
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

989
00:57:16,868 --> 00:57:19,129
[SPEAKER_05]: And now it's time for the final thoughts.

990
00:57:20,329 --> 00:57:21,129
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, just kidding.

991
00:57:21,169 --> 00:57:21,769
[SPEAKER_05]: Just kidding, people.

992
00:57:22,129 --> 00:57:23,650
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, Loki, your final thought.

993
00:57:23,950 --> 00:57:30,691
[SPEAKER_04]: My final thought is I must play more Star Soldier, and goddammit, they better have my copy of Graffiti Kingdom.

994
00:57:31,598 --> 00:57:34,299
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, besides getting your mic fixed, what's your final thought?

995
00:57:34,959 --> 00:57:39,620
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes, the reason why I say I don't play any games during the week is because I have a life!

996
00:57:40,580 --> 00:57:42,200
[SPEAKER_01]: I work and I go to college!

997
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:42,840
[SPEAKER_01]: Sue me!

998
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:44,641
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody ruffled your feathers this week, didn't we?

999
00:57:47,061 --> 00:57:53,362
[SPEAKER_05]: And my final thought, I'm hungry, so I'm going to go have a pizza.

1000
00:57:53,983 --> 00:57:55,783
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe you should call the pizza man!

1001
00:57:57,568 --> 00:57:58,188
[SPEAKER_05]: Goodbye, everybody.

1002
00:57:58,208 --> 00:57:59,188
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for tuning in.

1003
00:57:59,288 --> 00:58:00,649
[SPEAKER_05]: See you next time on the Orange Line.

1004
00:58:00,689 --> 00:58:02,729
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys are going to do a cast next week, right?

1005
00:58:02,989 --> 00:58:03,409
[SPEAKER_05]: Ow!

1006
00:58:03,649 --> 00:58:04,149
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1007
00:58:05,269 --> 00:58:07,230
[SPEAKER_01]: Your table got all GTA on my elbow.

1008
00:58:07,270 --> 00:58:08,850
[SPEAKER_05]: She got beat up by Pizza Man.

1009
00:58:11,650 --> 00:58:12,651
[SPEAKER_05]: Put down the joke.

1010
00:58:12,751 --> 00:58:14,051
[SPEAKER_05]: Step away from the joke.

1011
00:58:15,711 --> 00:58:18,112
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, at least it's not, you know, cake pie anymore.

1012
00:58:18,192 --> 00:58:20,252
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys are going to be here next week even though I'm not, right?

1013
00:58:20,392 --> 00:58:20,652
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1014
00:58:20,932 --> 00:58:24,213
[SPEAKER_01]: We will be taking over the podcast.

1015
00:58:24,313 --> 00:58:25,713
[SPEAKER_05]: That should be interesting.

1016
00:58:27,054 --> 00:58:28,955
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be anger chat for 30 minutes.

1017
00:58:29,216 --> 00:58:31,197
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I could always call in on Skype or something.

1018
00:58:32,378 --> 00:58:33,759
[SPEAKER_05]: We could always set you on fire.

1019
00:58:34,179 --> 00:58:36,701
[SPEAKER_05]: Until next time, boys and girls.

1020
00:58:38,122 --> 00:58:41,705
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the end of another Orange Lounge Radio To Go edition.

1021
00:58:42,005 --> 00:58:48,990
[SPEAKER_03]: This podcast is a proud part of www.orangeloungeradio.com See you next update.
