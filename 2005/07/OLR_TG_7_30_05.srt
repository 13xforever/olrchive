9
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:54,840
know suddenly I'm inspired to think about what I saw at Hot Topic today oh

10
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,400
Oh first though let me introduce the one and only, Loki! Hi!

11
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:03,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Anyway, so I was at Hot Topic today, right? That store that sells

12
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,200
all the, you know,

13
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,640
goth-y kind of clothes and I don't know what- Insta-Goth. Sorta.

14
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,920
Hot Gothic. Well right now they're pushing a line of Resident Evil

15
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,080
t-shirts it looks like so when you're kinda doing the I'm so dead kinda makes me

16
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:14,800
think of Zombie.

17
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:19,960
I actually have Resident Evil t-shirts. I'm mad though because the shirt that I want they only sell online.

18
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:23,400
Really? What shirt's that? 2D. They have a Gorillaz shirt.

19
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,240
it's only online that's that's not the same resident evil I'm thinking of

20
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:31,080
alright anyway I already have a bunch of

21
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:34,920
like the ones they give to the video game stores I have all kinds of swag

22
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,680
yeah we know you get the hookup lucky you had the major hookup for the rest of

23
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,880
us there's the store

24
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:43,720
thank you very much I got the major hookup this week Orange Launch Radio needs to

25
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:46,360
give up some of our listeners the hookup you know we got some prizes we gotta start

26
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:46,880
giving away

27
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,960
so we'll have to do that in the next few weeks but not not tonight

28
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,560
we're actually taping a little bit early this week because I'm going to be

29
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,400
leaving I'm flying away going to the

30
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,060
East Coast very soon so. I have something for our listeners to hear.

31
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:03,200
What's that? Your DS?

32
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,720
It's very quiet

33
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,520
it's hard to hear. What is this?

34
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:15,840
I hear some ambient noises. I have Nintendogs.

35
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,800
Nintendogs? How did you get Nintendogs? Now this is not the Japanese version.

36
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:27,000
nope it's not this is the u.s. version like we can barely hear it on there

37
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,040
what's okay tell us about your gaming week what's going on here

38
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:35,880
I have come into a copy of the five-minute demo of the Nintendo oh a lot of people

39
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,720
are gonna start writing you some nasty emails if you had the full version but

40
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,520
still you got the demo that's kind of neat I've been playing with my puppies

41
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:47,080
what Loki I've got news on that actually there are many people coming into the

42
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:53,000
copies of Nintendogs early. How so? Well, if we want to get the news right away. No,

43
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,120
let Dark Soccer talk about the game first, then we'll get to that. Okay, so, so tell

44
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,920
us a little more about the game, because at E3, the line was so big to play, I heard it

45
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:07,000
bark, the line was so big to play this game at E3 that I barely got a chance to really

46
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,280
look at it. I know it was one of my favorite games of the show, but you've actually had

47
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:14,160
a chance to play it a little more in detail this week. What the heck is Nintendogs? What

48
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:22,600
makes it so dang special play with your bubbies is what makes it so great though

49
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:32,520
you play with your puppies that's it you just play with dogs what are you okay so

50
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:37,240
they're barking we get it that's cute cute if we have the graphics especially

51
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:41,560
because the graphics are part of this and they start barking along with it

52
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:48,160
And you can do the frisbee and they catch it have you noticed an object to this game at all like is there so are

53
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:52,280
You play with your puppies like even it, but even an animal crossing which was a very?

54
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:57,360
Free game where you could do practically whatever you wanted there was still that goal of paying off your house

55
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,600
Well late as you play through the game

56
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:04,560
You can train your dogs and stuff and you compete in different like events and stuff like they have a new dog training events

57
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,560
And you unlock more dog breeds

58
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:12,340
And also, if other people, say for instance you have Nintendogs Chihuahua, and someone

59
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:18,020
has Nintendogs, um, what was it, Labrador Retriever or something like that, if you're

60
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:22,500
nearby, and they interact with each other, it unlocks Labrador Retriever and the one

61
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,580
with Chihuahua and Chihuahua and the one with Labrador Retriever.

62
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:29,100
So even though they're selling this game, like, when they announced it was going on

63
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:35,380
sale it sounded like Pokemon Red and Blue, where only certain mixes of dogs were going

64
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:38,140
going to be available in different versions.

65
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,060
Basically, one of the things was also,

66
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:42,140
remember how they changed some of the breeds that

67
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:44,380
are in this version, the US versus Japanese?

68
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,460
Yeah.

69
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:48,100
All the Japanese dogs are unlockable.

70
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,020
They're the unlocks.

71
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,020
Oh, that's kind of cool.

72
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:52,220
So I get to have my Shih Tzu, right?

73
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,580
Yes, you can have your Shih Tzu.

74
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:56,020
What we need to see, though, is if the Japanese version

75
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,820
and the US ones will interact.

76
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,100
Oh, that would be interesting.

77
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,140
Because I know people over here with the Japanese version.

78
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:04,060
And if you walk by with the game and someone else

79
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:08,760
their dogs, they'll start barking. That's cool. If it detects another copy of the game

80
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:14,220
on and playing nearby. What did you think after your five minute demo? Puppies! So in

81
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,380
other words, you're sold on this game? Puppies! You'll be buying the full version when it

82
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:20,980
comes out? All they need, Mike, is Nintendo kitties. Oh, I am buying all three versions

83
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:25,820
when this comes out. But you don't need all three versions if you get them. I don't care!

84
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:30,940
I am buying them for the strict purpose of annoying my coworker because he hates this

85
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:35,820
game because it's so damn cute and so i'm going to be playing it with the volume full blast you know

86
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:42,140
and just go hey you know what you know what there's three of us three versions of the game lab already

87
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:47,100
we should get the three three different versions all right there we go and i'll get the shih tzu

88
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:51,980
hopefully it's in a different one well i was going to get the lab anyway because it has

89
00:05:51,980 --> 00:06:00,460
other breeds that i want like um a jack russell terrier and uh uh i think the miniature dachshund

90
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:03,900
I'm just gonna buy all three you can't wait to trade

91
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:08,060
you just need all three well at least I know where I get the dogs from alright anything else in your gaming week

92
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:12,220
um I play lots of Ragnarok Ragnarok online the old

93
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:16,660
well I didn't actually play it as me hunting down the Korean version of Ragnarok online

94
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:19,900
why? because I was gonna start playing on a free server again

95
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:23,100
isn't Ragnarok 2 on its way pretty soon? I'm waiting

96
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,580
to hear something on the beta of that one I thought I'd read something recently and

97
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:29,460
forgive me listeners you guys might know more about this than I do but that Ragnarok 2

98
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:29,980
was

99
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:34,060
Like around the corner. It was something that was gonna be here by year's end. I could have thought I read somewhere

100
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:38,340
I hope I keep checking gravity site and then there's another game that one of our

101
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:42,880
Listeners suggested to us. Mm-hmm. I got an email from Iris

102
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:50,400
Who is in South Korea? Hi Iris who that was my grandma's name really? That's nice name

103
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,020
Who suggested a game?

104
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:59,040
That I actually haven't had too much of an opportunity. It's called Darwinia. I like the name already

105
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:03,760
hmm but I actually was intending on downloading it a couple of days ago and

106
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:08,200
I had some computer issues is it like a game that you get to win the Darwin

107
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:12,280
award by having your character be as stupid as possible well you know what I

108
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:17,200
am something tells me I'm wrong let me let me see if I can find it real quick

109
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:20,200
okay that's cool in the meantime we'll get back to more on Darwin you later

110
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:24,840
Loki how was your gaming week would even up to I've been playing star soldier go

111
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:29,720
Star Soldier that game is awesome for the PSP but what's great about the game

112
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,360
though is you play it like with a vertical screen so basically you have to

113
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:36,160
turn the PSP on its side so you have a long screen now remember you've been

114
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,300
reporting on these kinds of games on previous shows so it's kind of neat to

115
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:45,440
actually have one now yeah and it's just really a very cool game highly

116
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:51,000
recommended I mean I cannot just stress how wonderful this game is also got on a

117
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:58,000
UMD movie, actually. They hooked me up with Oldboy. It's a Japanese movie, I think. It's

118
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,440
very cool, and so now I have two UMDs, you know, one to go with Spider-Man 2. Whoop-de-doo.

119
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,720
I'm not actually going to buy any more movies, but I've been playing that. I played Bomberman

120
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:13,880
Panic Bomber, which, you know, I was hoping it was more of a Bomberman game, but it's

121
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:19,520
another puzzle game. This is the PSP one? PSP one. They have a lot of puzzle games for

122
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:24,240
the PSP out there and then really, yeah, those have been the games.

123
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,760
Alright, anything else? Just those games? Nah, I wish I had played some PlayStation

124
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:32,600
2 stuff. I'm waiting for Graffiti Kingdom. They sent out a press release on Thursday

125
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:37,600
saying, oh, the game got shipped! Go to GameStop. No, we have our information that says it's

126
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:42,040
coming out on August 8th or August 9th. I'm like, yeah, that's what I heard before this

127
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,400
press release came out. Because nobody wants Graffiti Kingdom but you.

128
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,560
Yeah, they told me, they're all, you're going to have to pre-order this game if you want

129
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:52,880
at all, because we're getting like three copies total. I'm like, fuck you, I will go to Fry's,

130
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:57,560
so eat that. Interesting. Is that the sequel to Magic Pen

131
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,080
Gel? Sort of.

132
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:03,920
It's much of a sequel in the game sense, you know, where you have the same gameplay and

133
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,600
stuff, but the storyline is not a direct sequel. Magic Pen Gel, for those that don't know,

134
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,760
is like this kind of cultish game. I don't think it was really big. It had a rock-paper-scissors

135
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:17,160
battle style system, so it's pretty simple in concept, but you could draw your own monsters,

136
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,800
which was really the cool thing about it.

137
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,440
You literally drew your own, it's like Pokemon,

138
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,560
but you draw your own Pokemon.

139
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,800
So of course my friends and I were playing this game

140
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,880
and we were drawing all sorts of phallic things

141
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:32,880
and just all the two-year-old type humor

142
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,280
you could think of when we were drawing

143
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:37,360
and the game doesn't stop you, so.

144
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,040
Yeah, there was the big cock monster.

145
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,280
Yeah, I remember there was like the big cock monster

146
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,520
and then I'm like, you know, I walked out of the room

147
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,560
for a bit and I come back in, I'm like, is that a cannon?

148
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,560
No, it's a penis! Like, you can't draw. Anyway.

149
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,560
That would be great if I could, like, use my tablet.

150
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,560
But the new thing, though, what's great about this game is it's more of a platformer.

151
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,560
Not really a platformer, it's more of, like, a hack and slash type game.

152
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,560
Oh, cool.

153
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:05,560
Which is really cool. And, oh my god, they have websites dedicated to what the Japanese have done with this.

154
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:12,560
They've recreated everything. They've recreated, like, Samus, Link, Gundam, you know, just, like, really detailed stuff.

155
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,560
They've recreated a Terminator Robocop. It's amazing.

156
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:19,160
It's amazing. I'm excited about the game and Magic Penjal had kind of a

157
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,180
crappy battle system, so I'm glad to hear it's going hack-and-slash.

158
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:25,380
Alright, Dark Soccer, you found more information on Darwinia?

159
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:31,200
If you go to Dar... it's d-a-r-w-i-n-i-a dot c-o dot u-k.

160
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,040
Basically, I'll just read the little blurb on here. The World of Darwinia is a virtual

161
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:40,300
theme park running inside a computer network built by a computer genius

162
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:44,120
named Dr. Sepulveda, I guess.

163
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:49,160
okay darwinia is populated by ascension involving life form called the darwinians

164
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,200
they are the product of a decade's worth of research

165
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,720
into genetic algorithms so what kind of game does it look like because i thought

166
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:00,440
this was just another you know ye old rpg style game but this looks

167
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:04,360
like a futuristic type thing it looks like the sims meets tron it

168
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:08,600
looked kind of like lawnmower man to me i don't know but let me look at

169
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,760
a few more of these screenshots on here though it

170
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:15,760
it really does look very much like crime. Let's download the demo and check it out

171
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,720
because the listener was wanting us to check it out so there's a demo right? Well I had intended on doing so

172
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,080
doing so I'll probably get that started when I get home tonight.

173
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:27,400
It'll be a follow-up in the future. My gaming week, I didn't play anything new guys

174
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:30,560
sorry to say I've been preparing for my trip but for some wacky reason

175
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,000
like I decided to get back into Guild Wars because I was like okay I'm not

176
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,160
gonna pay money to reactivate my Final Fantasy XI account when I'm gonna be

177
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,020
leaving soon

178
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:41,480
and I don't want to start a new game, like I've been contemplating

179
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,780
checking out World of Warcraft, one of my friends is really really trying to get me on there

180
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:48,740
I know, PSO, Dark Soccer is trying to get me on PSO

181
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:52,140
but Guild Wars, luckily, loving it

182
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:55,180
once you buy it, you can play it forever for free, no monthly fee, so I can go

183
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:58,220
back whenever I want and I knew I would do this too, that I'd play it for two weeks

184
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:01,580
leave, go back again, but here's the weird thing about my habits with Guild Wars

185
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:05,180
I started a new character, everybody in my old guild doesn't play the game anymore

186
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,100
so it's just me

187
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:11,100
So here I am playing the game by myself, and I'm thinking I'm playing an MMO by myself

188
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:15,860
What's the point but it's still like kind of fun

189
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,860
I think I'd be having more fun if there were people out there that would play with me

190
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:23,940
Cry if someone would buy me the game. I would play Oh got 50 bucks to spare

191
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,700
If someone would buy me the game I would play

192
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:33,380
Maybe we got a really light nice listener out there. I don't know sure second pay money for it. I've seen Guild Wars

193
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:39,900
I like I like Guild Wars. It's neat. It's it's um. It's just I don't like the style

194
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:46,340
It's more of a strategy like I had a G action fuse

195
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:51,180
You'll have to pull my cold dead body away from Final Fantasy 11

196
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:57,140
I may not have played it for over a month, but you know what I am not quitting not from my cold dead

197
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:02,540
I'm just pissed off that I can't download the Korean version of Ragnarok online cuz

198
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:08,820
the Korean Ragnarok site is only me get it and I don't want to have to pay

199
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:12,140
$30 for three more months of Ragnarok online to play my old dead character

200
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:18,540
thing is my character will on the old Ragnarok will never be deleted for those

201
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:21,140
that don't know Ragnarok because we've talked about an awful lot tonight real

202
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:27,220
quick describe it it's really cutesy MMORPG it's adorable it's I found the

203
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:30,180
picture of your character who wore the little ribbon yes I had a character the

204
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:35,780
wore a ribbon but it's like Secret of Mana in a way, some folks kinda, but imagine it

205
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:36,780
as an MMO.

206
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:37,780
It's very kitschy.

207
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:38,780
In a 3D world.

208
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:39,780
Yes.

209
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:43,200
It's really adorable if you just go to rocknrockonline.com.

210
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:49,200
Not 3D in the Halo or Doom 3D sense, 3D in the like up at an angle shot.

211
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,200
Like Pac-Mania.

212
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,040
It's a 3D environment but the characters are sprites.

213
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,040
Yes.

214
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,040
There you go.

215
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:59,040
Alright, quick news story on Final Fantasy XI since Loki brought it up to start us off

216
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,040
tonight.

217
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:03,200
you're saying they won't tear the game from your cold dead hands. How about a story that

218
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:07,400
might take you off? Final Fantasy XI, the Vana Deal Collection will ship for the PC

219
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:13,120
on August 16th. What is this, a new expansion pack? No, it's just Final Fantasy XI, Rise

220
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:19,120
of the Zilert and Chains of Promathia and Tetra Master all bundled together for $29.99.

221
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,720
So those of you guys that spent 50 bucks on the game and 30 on the expansion just got

222
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:27,520
screwed. But it happens with every MMO, it really does.

223
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:30,400
We'll look at Rise of the Zillerts at one time.

224
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:34,840
It was being sold as an expansion, and they just updated it.

225
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,840
Whatever.

226
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,040
Alright, thought I'd share that.

227
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:42,240
Let's see, I actually have an abundance of Square news tonight.

228
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,540
Let me get some of these other Square stories out of the way.

229
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:50,040
Kingdom Hearts 2 has a date, this being announced at the Squeenix Party 2005 event in Tokyo,

230
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:53,200
hence why we have all the Squeenix news tonight.

231
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:57,200
Kingdom Hearts 2 will be out in Japan this year in December.

232
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:01,280
No set in stone date for the US yet, however they've really been pushing to localize their

233
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,280
games quickly.

234
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:05,640
I have to admit I'm surprised they're going to miss Christmas at this rate.

235
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:08,520
I would have thought Kingdom Hearts 2 would be a very powerful Christmas title to have

236
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,520
out there.

237
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:14,400
It seems kind of silly to miss Christmas here, but it ain't my company.

238
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:19,000
Also keep in mind though, when we get it, it's going to be better than the Japanese

239
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
one.

240
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
People are going to buy it no matter what.

241
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,920
What makes you say it's going to be better than the Japanese one?

242
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,960
Just like the last one, they actually had to redo an international version.

243
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:30,880
yes, Square Enix kind of does that stuff where they add like that because the Sephiroth battle wasn't in the original Kingdom Hearts, right?

244
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,800
That was something new for North American. It actually wasn't in ours either, but they brought out the

245
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,560
the

246
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:41,640
sort of updated international version that had the Sephiroth battle and the deep dive trailer. Interesting.

247
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:47,680
Final Fantasy 12 also got a date at the Squeenix party. Ships in Japan on March 16th,

248
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:53,560
2006, so still a little wait, and that's just Japan's date, meaning we've got to wait three to four months.

249
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,420
So maybe we're looking at Christmas next year for Final Fantasy 12

250
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:02,100
Rumors why because Final Fantasy 12 supposedly is in the can it's done in Japan

251
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:07,460
It's ready to go just they're putting the finishing touches on it, but supposedly because of the Kingdom Hearts 2 news

252
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,580
That's why they're waiting on Final Fantasy 12

253
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:16,340
Don't want to they figure it's got the same fan base. I think to an extent they're probably right, but come on

254
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:20,220
They're gonna buy it should be a Christmas title people that are into one game are gonna buy both games

255
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:25,520
I don't know crazy with these people think sometimes Final Fantasy 7 advent

256
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:34,080
children will be released in theaters in Japan probably in theaters in Berkeley

257
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:38,800
and little tiny I told those Sony reps when they came to our work I'm like you

258
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,900
gotta fucking put this in tears well this is all this marketing I'm like

259
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:48,440
word-of-mouth word-of-mouth well nothing it not even news on any type of u.s.

260
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,560
release little distribution area no North American distribution as of yet

261
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:55,160
here's the reason why I'm thinking it's not gonna happen in the US because it's

262
00:16:55,160 --> 00:17:00,280
gonna premiere in Japan on September 8th the DVD by the way comes out September

263
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:04,800
14th so it's really just a super sneak preview for those diehard people that

264
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:08,840
have to see it in the theater and if I was in Japan I'd be one of them I think

265
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:14,600
it's gonna have a limited run here you think I don't um eskaflowne but I had a

266
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,560
limited run but would they get that I mean we're talking energy we're only

267
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:20,460
about six weeks out from this now I don't think that's enough time to put

268
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:23,980
together a theater release I do believe that there would be time we'll see we'll

269
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:30,580
see subtitles on that we'll see screw dubs still more stories still more

270
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:36,040
stories Kingdom Hearts 2 Hikaru Utada of course did the theme song for the first

271
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:40,020
Kingdom Hearts game she's coming back she's gonna sing a song called passion

272
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:45,260
which will be in Kingdom Hearts 2 no word yet as to whether she's gonna

273
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:48,880
record it in English and Japanese but since she did the first one in English

274
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,820
and Japanese and she is fully bilingual exactly and you know she has her own

275
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:57,800
album out here which I don't think did so hot it's she's easy breezy in your

276
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:03,980
Japanese anyway so she'll have the song passion the single should be coming out

277
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:08,840
being put out by Toshiba EMI will come out around December same time as

278
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:13,560
Kingdom Hearts 2 is planning to come out one more story I got it's a Final

279
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,100
Final Fantasy XI story again.

280
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:20,040
You know how Xbox 360 Final Fantasy XI has everybody going OMG OMG what's going to be

281
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:24,120
different in the Final Fantasy XI version on Xbox 360?

282
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:29,000
Well you're going to find out if you live in Germany.

283
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Get this.

284
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,080
They're actually going to be showing it in Germany at the games convention in Lipsig.

285
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,240
That happens August 17th through the 21st.

286
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:41,000
It doesn't say in the press release that it's going to be playable but it does say in the

287
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,920
press release that European gamers will get their first look at the next

288
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:49,160
generation gateway to the world of Anadiel should be interesting you know I

289
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:52,760
heard a rumor one quick rumor about for those you Final Fantasy 11 players I

290
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:56,680
don't know if this is true or not but what they're gonna do with the 360 is

291
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:59,960
they're gonna put the same upgrades in 360 that they do on the PC and

292
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:03,160
PlayStation 2 users unfortunately gonna get left behind in this but that they're

293
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:06,280
gonna make the capes viewable it's supposedly something because you know

294
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:09,080
how your character won't wear a cape in Final Fantasy 11 but you never see it

295
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:13,200
supposedly that's gonna be one of the graphical upgrades so I don't know take

296
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,860
it with a grain of salt people we'll find out when the game is shown in

297
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:18,640
Europe but that would be kind of neat. Maybe it's an option you would be able to turn on in

298
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,960
the PC version if you have high enough graphics card. Oh I don't see why not

299
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:26,340
certainly. My graphics card would handle it. Yeah I'm surprised they haven't released a

300
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:29,960
patch like that for capes in the PC version. Well maybe they're waiting for

301
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:34,760
this. Yeah well you never know I mean they can do who knows with that um the

302
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:38,640
new 360 game coming out they're probably gonna release another expansion at the

303
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:43,620
same time there you go maybe maybe we don't know yet well possibly all right

304
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:47,900
we'll see anyway let's go past the Squeenix news and let's get into

305
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:51,900
inflating our egos a little bit by opening up the old mailbag so if you

306
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:57,100
want to send us an email all you have to do is send an email to to go to at

307
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:02,100
orange lounge radio.com and dark Sakura will have something to say to you dark

308
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:07,380
Sakura what do you have to say tonight I actually got a bunch of email and one

309
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:14,060
the first one I want to bring up is by someone named Roo who wrote into us

310
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:19,900
about the whole hot coffee deal and actually and this is something that I

311
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:24,220
actually didn't see on any of my references but when I went back and dug

312
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:29,980
deeper after receiving the email yes it is true and the whole deal was actually

313
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:37,140
sort of launched off by Hillary Clinton kinda she got behind it too I think

314
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:41,760
I think she, having her behind it really threw the thing into orbit.

315
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,920
I mean it was kind of like where it went to the next level.

316
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:49,280
But I believe it was originally brought to the attention by Assemblyman Li Lin Yi I think

317
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:56,400
because they had this guy on G4TV and usually I don't talk about G4TV because they have

318
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,720
a reputation for kind of having bad programming, but actually it's gotten a lot better.

319
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:05,760
And I actually watched G4TV.com and ever since they got that new guy on the show, he's really

320
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:09,600
brought it up in the two girls are up to that same level i think is actually had

321
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,180
the legal any on their show and it was actually pretty good interview i have to

322
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,140
say so

323
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:17,260
this kind of interesting i thought sorry just wanted to get that

324
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:19,780
well this email though uh...

325
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:24,240
you know it's basically it's not just the conservatives that are behind it

326
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,180
we've got

327
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:28,480
basically everybody and you know it also brought brought up to uh...

328
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,700
the whole reason why i didn't go democrat way back we know because of

329
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,460
lieberman

330
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,620
I was not gonna have Lieberman and Tippercore

331
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:38,820
anywhere near our video game industry.

332
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:43,060
There was also, though, another article, though,

333
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:44,780
this made me think of,

334
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:46,680
that I'm gonna get back to the mailbag,

335
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:50,740
I just have to see where I stored this article,

336
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:54,060
about how, actually, the rate of crime

337
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:58,620
in our country's youth decreased.

338
00:21:58,620 --> 00:21:59,460
You have a link to this?

339
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,380
I bet a lot of people would be interested in reading this.

340
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:02,300
Yes, I do.

341
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:05,120
and it's gonna take me just a brief moment.

342
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,800
Actually, if you'll take care of one of our other emails.

343
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,160
That's all right, yeah, I'll go to one of the other emails.

344
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,440
I just wanna say, was that the same guy

345
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,000
who you invited to do the article for the site?

346
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,560
Yes, it is, I invited him to write an editorial

347
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,400
regarding that for us.

348
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,220
That'll be cool.

349
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:20,880
Like I said, guys, politics and gaming podcasts

350
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,840
sometimes don't mix, but that's all right.

351
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,160
Hey, we gotta, whatever you believe in,

352
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,440
at least go out and vote,

353
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,640
because we get the freedom to do that in this country.

354
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,320
She just, you know, here's what it comes down to, okay?

355
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:36,560
Okay, the whole hot coffee mod hit a little too close to home, if you know what I mean,

356
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:40,400
with Hillary Clinton, because the whole hot coffee mod starts off with CJ coming in for

357
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,880
some lovin', what's the woman do?

358
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,000
She gets down to business.

359
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:51,240
Oh damn, oh damn, oh, oh, oh, wait, wait, oh that happened to Hillary, that happened

360
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,240
to Hillary.

361
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:57,280
Look, look, look, look, I think the issue here is really about the regulation of the

362
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:01,880
not trying to ban them and I think remember guys Hillary Clinton isn't

363
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:05,840
trying to ban the game she's trying to regulate them so she's basically again

364
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:10,360
encouraging parents not to do their job which I you know and even though I am a

365
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:13,500
Democrat I'll admit it I don't necessarily have to support her on every

366
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:17,320
little thing she does this is one of those things where I think every senator

367
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:21,560
Republican Democrat and the one independent guy could all be educated on

368
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:24,560
the gaming world a little bit thank you very much all right here well I didn't

369
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:28,080
have that article here okay cool it can be located I'll go ahead and give the

370
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:36,020
address it's gr bolt comm slash articles slash violence slash violence dot HTM

371
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:44,100
hey has a violence in there twice anyway this was written by Duke Ferris who

372
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,960
writes on this site it's a game revolution is what it is so he's

373
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:52,780
basically presenting facts to show that violence has gone down not up amongst

374
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:58,780
This information that he's reported on here is actually a very well-written article, which really surprised me for this site.

375
00:23:58,780 --> 00:23:59,780
Wow.

376
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:09,780
It's using statistics put out by the U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Statistics, and information also pulled from the files of the FBI, public files.

377
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:16,780
Um, basically, it's showing that since right before the release of, uh, the PlayStation,

378
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:24,780
we've got, uh, basically a mark showing from 93 on, crime has decreased.

379
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:29,780
See, I don't know, there's gotta be a loophole somewhere because, and now granted, I'm about to say,

380
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:33,780
watching the news every night, you would think the complete opposite to be true, but yes, I know.

381
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,780
Of course, the news is trying to glamorize this.

382
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:37,780
The news sensationalizes it. Anyway.

383
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:42,380
You know, again, they make their money by fooling the public.

384
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:46,180
Here come those emails again. Wait, you mean it's

385
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:49,340
not hot outside? Anyway,

386
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:52,780
check out the article. Give the link one more time. Draw your own conclusions from

387
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:53,620
this guy. No, no, no.

388
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:56,940
Again, keep in mind, I'm not really talking, you know, your local news

389
00:24:56,940 --> 00:25:00,500
is cool, I think. At least,

390
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:03,780
you know, whenever I watch the news here, I don't see anything over, you know, sensational or

391
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:04,740
anything

392
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:10,820
out of the ordinary. I'm talking about like they pick one instance and then it's all on CNN.

393
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:16,580
You're talking about like MSNBC doing the Michael Jackson trial 24-7. Exactly. Now that I can agree

394
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:20,260
with. It's like they take one issue, blow it way out of proportion until suddenly the entire

395
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:27,300
public thinks every kid who ever plays a video game is gonna come cut off my head in my sleep.

396
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:34,420
Oh. Lord have mercy we all gonna die from GTA. Yeah that. Which I'm sure you're gonna talk

397
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:41,380
about the grandma oh yeah I'll bring up grandma on a minute what go ahead there

398
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:46,780
was one other thing in here I mean it's basically one of the charts on here

399
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:52,500
which is what I would like to show to most of our listeners is that there is a

400
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:57,500
very good chart on here that separates everything by age by age group and

401
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:02,380
actually in the group the biggest decline in violent crime was between the

402
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:05,380
14 and 17-year-old group.

403
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:06,060
It's wow.

404
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:07,860
OK, well, give the link one more time.

405
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,300
Let folks draw their own conclusions.

406
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:13,900
It's dr.bolt.com slash articles slash violence slash violence

407
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:14,800
dot htm.

408
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,860
And I'll go ahead at some point.

409
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:18,180
Post that in our forums.

410
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:21,820
Actually, we'll repeat a link to the article on our announcement

411
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:22,420
from the website.

412
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:24,100
Sounds good.

413
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:26,300
All right, did you still want me to read the next letter?

414
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,980
OK, I got an email here from Justin M.

415
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:31,500
And this is nice because this is just nothing but an ego

416
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:35,460
inflation letter I like many others discovered your fine podcast through

417
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:38,640
iTunes version 4.9 and I just want to let you know that you were doing a

418
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,100
wonderful job with it thank you I have heard of orange launch radio before but

419
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:45,020
didn't have the time to sit down and listen to a live show every week the

420
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:49,620
shows we do on Sunday night having it readily available on my iPod to listen

421
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:56,300
to whenever I'm ready to just is the grammar gets weird here unbelievably huge

422
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:59,500
step in the right direction for talk shows and it really helps bring out some

423
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:03,940
the talent that would otherwise lie untapped well that's quite a compliment

424
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:08,020
thank you very much for that email and the most we can ask get a friend to

425
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:10,840
subscribe to the show tell one person about the show and then the news of

426
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:14,080
orange lounge spreads everywhere and we're all happy and you're happy because

427
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:18,120
you get a new show every week and etc etc I did want to make a mention that

428
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:22,120
one of our listeners Michael I thought was really cool that we were talking

429
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:26,740
about scorched earth dude scorched earth was the game I that was my junior high

430
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:31,660
school lunches for like a year it is still the game in fact still waiting for

431
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:37,300
them to finish the PSP homebrew version of PSP home huh they are I fully

432
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:45,100
endorsed the PSP for these reasons and then there was also one of our

433
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:52,620
Macintosh supporters wrote in but I know where this is going Loki and I said I

434
00:27:52,620 --> 00:28:00,620
I forward this to Loki earlier. No offense, because I appreciate receiving the email.

435
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:05,620
But when one is speaking of the general intelligence level of a Macintosh user,

436
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:09,620
make sure you use your spell checker and grammar checker before sending your email.

437
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:14,620
Because I counted no less than 15 grammatical and spelling errors.

438
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:21,620
That's ironic. Loki, just shut up. I have a Mac story at the end and I think it's cool.

439
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:26,420
I'm not knocking the max, okay, because, granted, the processing power may not be what I was

440
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:27,420
looking for.

441
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:28,420
Their cases look cool, though.

442
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:29,420
Okay?

443
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:30,420
Their cases are nice.

444
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:31,420
Freaking widescreen monitor on the outside.

445
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:32,420
Hold on.

446
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:33,420
Hold on.

447
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,420
The monitor is nice.

448
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:37,380
Did we go to Bizarro Orange Lounge Radio, because I just heard Loki say something nice

449
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:38,900
about a Macintosh.

450
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:43,180
The cases look nice, but that's all they are is just a big graphene calculator inside of

451
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,180
a nice case.

452
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,180
No, no, no.

453
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:47,180
Somebody put a death threat out on you, didn't they?

454
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,180
No.

455
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:56,620
It's like I had I you know when we were conversing about this while I was supposed to be at work.

456
00:28:56,620 --> 00:29:05,060
The Mac is a very I think best used for either people who are not up to a PC or for the professional

457
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:07,980
needing the specific benefits that a Mac provides.

458
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:12,620
Let me put it this way if you're going to pick between a Mac an iMac or whatever and

459
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:18,100
an e-machine go with the iMac because e-machines suck even more and that's pretty bad.

460
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:20,100
That was kind of a nice thing

461
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:26,700
We're not make sure you're on there. I'm on Oh E machines. However are very good for modifying

462
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:31,220
They are very easily upgraded all right anyway back to the anyways back to the although

463
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:33,340
I was at the Apple Store today, and I drew a little bit

464
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:39,820
I want to fries, and I'm thinking about getting and I'm actually five see we're gonna outnumber you soon enough all right

465
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:46,340
I'm there just because a regular g5 is freaking expensive. Let's go. Let's move on and that 30 inch widescreen monitor

466
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:52,000
I got an email here. Can I read this one? Okay. Okay. This was somebody who has way too much time on their hands

467
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:59,520
It's from cliff our cliff sent us a email letting us know our statistics that as of on August 1st

468
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:07,400
2005 not counting our e3 episodes 30 podcast episodes spanning over 17 hours and 400 megabytes

469
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:10,960
Our shortest podcast was the very first one on January 3rd

470
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:15,780
19 minutes and 46 seconds and our longest podcast had a running time of

471
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:21,260
exactly 46 minutes and get this cliff figured this out for us average podcast

472
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:27,520
episode 33 minutes 24 seconds you know I didn't care before but I do now that was

473
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,340
very cool thank you cliff for he actually saved me a lot of work cuz I

474
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:33,980
was gonna start putting that together for some of our business things going on

475
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:37,260
the side we're gonna beat that 46 minutes records we don't get to the next

476
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:40,820
same it so you got any more emails one more actually been sent the week before

477
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:44,060
but I hadn't had a chance to read it because I've got a lot of email from him

478
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:49,140
sure that's cool um one of our regular Sunday night listeners right on our live

479
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:55,660
show wrote in DJ Ranma s oh in this email he he said this his 13 year old

480
00:30:55,660 --> 00:31:00,060
cousin got GTA San Andreas for ps2 now he plays this game all the time and

481
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:03,420
believe it or not knows that knows better the interactions of the game has

482
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:07,140
no effect on him I say that because his mother and me talked to him all the time

483
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:10,620
about these games gangs life and everything else I admit he does hang out

484
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:18,420
with friends that act more ghetto than CJ at times but I I can't believe that

485
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:23,580
he doesn't do anything they do and that I was right and I'm going to quote here

486
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:27,500
parents if you were listening to this podcast your kids need home training

487
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:32,220
teach them the difference between real life and fantasy for God's sake well said

488
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:36,700
I think I think gamer parents are pretty well aware of that stuff I hope I really

489
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:41,860
hope anyway we're going into a new generation of gaming parents remember

490
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:47,220
parents treat games like they're drugs talk to your kids you know if you talk

491
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:50,620
to your kids about drugs they're less likely to do drugs just like you know

492
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:53,780
they're more likely to know the difference between right and wrong if

493
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:58,940
you talk to them yes really like you're in a very nice mood tonight Loki you

494
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:02,660
know you're all about love and affection so once we bring up grandma it's going

495
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:06,100
I have a hug. No, you know that made me think of one thing

496
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,860
Okay, I'll talk about grandma now get this an

497
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:20,700
85 year old woman suing take to entertainment over the hot coffee mod

498
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:26,100
She purchased the game for her 14 year old grandson and is now suing

499
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:29,860
Take to I this has been passed around on every gaming message board

500
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:33,100
surely those you guys that are checking gaming websites of any capacity have

501
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:38,260
heard about this and you probably just went WTF lady why are you buying this

502
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:42,140
game for your 14 year old kid in the first place again that's another case of

503
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:50,580
a person in a parental you know position not doing their research and not doing

504
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:56,140
their goddamn job and she's got some balls to be suing take to entertainment

505
00:32:56,140 --> 00:33:01,660
over it too she's gonna lose she bought the game and gave it if she did not want

506
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:05,100
offensive material to be put in the hands of a child she would have done her

507
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:08,800
research don't you think but what she's saying is that now the game is a oh she

508
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:13,540
wasn't fully educated before you know what it still had an M rating on it just

509
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:16,940
playing devil's advocate here I'm not gonna disagree with you people I'm just

510
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:20,180
playing devil's advocate still had an M rating on it damn it I thought that game

511
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:26,080
was rated R not NC 17 what the hell okay listen grandma first off okay I know

512
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:29,920
you might have wandered in there, you know, because you didn't know where you were and

513
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:32,120
you might have bought this game for your, you know, grandson.

514
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:35,720
You know, I'm thinking the grandson probably begged her to buy it.

515
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:38,280
Okay, so she bought the game.

516
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:44,120
Did it say in the article that he figured out how to unlock the hot content or the hot

517
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:46,040
coffee mod content?

518
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,440
No, it did not.

519
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,640
It specifically said because she found out that that content was in there.

520
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:58,300
we could say that he may not have been exposed to this content at all so she's

521
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:04,080
retarded she is friggin retarded okay she has no legal precedent either way

522
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,920
her lawyer is not gonna try to dissuade her because her lawyer is still gonna

523
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:12,320
make his money moving on that's that's all I want to say about grandma she's

524
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:16,200
getting too much media attention anyway there was another popular story that was

525
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:20,360
going around the internet this week involving a particular gamer and dark

526
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:26,440
you have a story on this one a blind teenager from Lincoln Nebraska who can

527
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:30,760
kick anybody's butt at Mortal Kombat basically although I think this article

528
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:34,840
is pretty stupid just because they talk about decapitations in Soul Calibur I

529
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:38,400
know don't happen that was the first thing I noticed in the article too that

530
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:41,880
made me kind of go stupid media person do your research before you talk about

531
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:45,200
games they talk about decapitation in Soul Calibur which doesn't happen this

532
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:49,200
guy probably thought that Soul Calibur that the reporter must have been blind

533
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:52,680
too because apparently Soulcalibur 2 and Mortal Kombat Deadly Alliance are the

534
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:59,360
same game but at any rate it sounds like that he just learned by trial and error

535
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:03,920
how to play and you know people would correct him when he did something wrong

536
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:07,000
his favorite thing he wants to be a video game designer when he graduates

537
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:12,600
which you know if I could see happening but you know no pun intended he plays

538
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:18,960
facing thank you plays facing away from the screen people challenge him strictly

539
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,520
on his blindness and he still kicks their butt which I can actually

540
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:25,840
understand that if you understand the timing of your attacks know who you're

541
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:31,880
using and hear the reaction on screen there shouldn't be any I challenge you

542
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:38,160
on mute but but still but still a heck of an accomplishment I mean even though

543
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,520
we could kind of think about okay this is probably how he does it still that

544
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,560
what a what a lot of time and patience and discipline to become that good at a

545
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:49,120
game so apparently he enjoys freaking people out by playing backwards that's

546
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:56,320
cool can we play him on Xbox Live does have a screen screen tag but you know if

547
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:02,120
he happens to be listening to you know his name Bryce yes he is listening to

548
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:05,800
this podcaster if anyone who's listening to this podcast knows him we

549
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:09,460
would love to interview him absolutely and we would love to challenge him on

550
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:14,920
Xbox live absolutely to DDR I'm just kidding I'm kidding I have I have the

551
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:18,880
Mortal Kombat game we could play that or Halo hey anybody can beat my ass and

552
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:27,680
Halo hey I had an eight-year-old kid an Xbox controller moving on another news

553
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:32,440

g4 every year it is going to air on August 9th but that doesn't mean we

555
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:42,020
won't ruin it for you right now the game of the year was Halo 2 favorite

556
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:47,180
character was the Kratos and God of War EB gamers choice award went to World of

557
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:53,660
Warcraft did Katamari Damacy win anything yes best innovation that one

558
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:59,840
game let's see how many awards Halo 2 got best boss best multiplayer game best

559
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:05,360
original soundtrack best shooter best sound design best voice performance and

560
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:09,240
and game of the year so it's a halo to whoring fast you know where it is

561
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:12,800
other than license soundtrack worse love for grand theft auto that game was at

562
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,240
the top

563
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:17,200
is still at the top of the charts and all the guy's best origin best license

564
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:20,560
sounds for a license soundtrack was the only word that lame

565
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:25,080
lame lame lame halo was just another first-person shooter

566
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:28,560
grand theft auto san andreas was revolution

567
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:32,280
there's tons of emails coming your way they're gonna disagree with you on that

568
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:37,800
I personally I actually enjoy Halo 2 more than Grand Theft Auto I do I think

569
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:43,980
the multiplayer party aspect of it makes it for me a more fun game but I still

570
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:46,760
don't know if I would have called it well yeah I think I would have had to

571
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:50,680
have called a game of the year I mean let's face it as neat of a game as

572
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:53,680
Katamari Damacy was and some of these other games came out in the past year it

573
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:58,760
really was a Halo 2 year so I can't say I necessarily disagree just the the

574
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:02,540
whoring in every category okay let the other games have a little room to breathe

575
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:06,940
please people moving on dark soccer you have any other news stories for us

576
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:13,160
tonight um we actually um a game that's coming out shortly and I'm actually

577
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:16,100
trying to get the u.s. release date because I know it's coming out very soon

578
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:21,580
Fire Emblem path of radiance is coming out my fiance has just been pissing his

579
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:25,040
pants waiting for this to come out because thank you for that visual thank

580
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:28,600
you well he's been even you know downloading because we were very

581
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:33,800
disappointed when you know the fire the fire emblem on a Game Boy Advance that

582
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:37,720
had Marth and Roy in it it didn't come out over here but the one after that did

583
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:42,840
which actually is a prequel to that and then the one following came out Dan's

584
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:45,800
has really been in the fire emblem and it actually may be the first strategy

585
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:49,400
game that I might actually give a serious chance the last one I played was

586
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:56,920
the macross game on the pc engine which anyway um but fire emblem uh path of radiance is coming out

587
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:01,800
to gamecube and i was checking out the uh uk news and of course i saw that i instantly went to it

588
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:06,760
um path of radiance has a uh november release date i don't have the specific date but it's

589
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:12,520
said to come out this november and uh apparently they're working on the pal conversion at present

590
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:18,760
and are ready to have it out all right very cool it's it's got some pretty screenshots on it too

591
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:22,640
It's really gorgeous, but it's still the same term-based strategy.

592
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:25,600
Loki, what's going on in the hack and crack world right now?

593
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:29,760
Lots of stuff, especially with people getting their panties in a bunch

594
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,440
over

595
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:34,200
version 2.0 of the firmware for PSP. You've got

596
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:37,360
a brand new home brew version of

597
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:40,400
a web browser that's actually been released right now. Now there's four

598
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,720
options for web browsing.

599
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:44,920
This one is called actually

600
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:52,440
The 2CH browser, and really the first version of it can only visit the site 2ch.jp or something,

601
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:56,640
some Japanese site, but the new one you can actually adjust the.ini file to cite your

602
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:02,560
own bookmarks and whatnot, but more work needs to be done on this because it's still not

603
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:07,760
too snuff with the 2.0 browser, which actually supports Java and downloads and whatnot.

604
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,400
So that's pretty cool.

605
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:14,880
Also, one of the really cool games that came out this week for the PSP homebrew was actually

606
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:21,000
port of Super Smash Brothers. No way. Yeah, Super Smash Brothers GP, which was actually

607
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:26,720
for the console GP32, they made it for that portable system, but now they've ported it

608
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:32,200
and you can put your own characters in there. Does it look like the GameCube one though?

609
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:38,640
No. It has the look and feel. It has the feel of it, it's not exactly the same detail and

610
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:41,980
But hey homebrew come on. I mean it's still fun, but

611
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:44,900
so that that came out and

612
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:52,960
Oh Sony is letting everyone know not to upgrade your US PlayStation portables to the 2.0 because that's meant for only Japanese

613
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:59,360
Playstations and it could harm your PlayStation and turn into a brick so will that stop you know no that won't stop people

614
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:02,600
But anyways as far as the DS stuff goes here

615
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:07,660
There's been a few things being worked on a brand new Super Nintendo player for it

616
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:12,260
But, honestly, emulation on the DS is tough, especially when you have to get all those

617
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:15,700
external cards and whatnot.

618
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:20,100
But anyways, earlier we had people asking us about some of the stuff going on in the

619
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:22,360
PC mod community and stuff.

620
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:26,580
So we've got a couple that look pretty interesting that I thought I'd bring up.

621
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:30,960
The first one is Antlion Troopers Deuce for Half-Life 2.

622
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:35,060
This is sort of like a Starship Troopers type mod for it.

623
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:36,060
That's cute.

624
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,060
That's cute.

625
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:44,060
have the topless shower scenes. I don't know about that, but the UMD does. But you can

626
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:51,280
get that at antlions.hl2world.com, so check it out there. The other one, and one of my

627
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:59,080
personal favorite webcomics, Penny Arcade, someone did the cardboard showdown with cardboard

628
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:05,080
tube samurai, and this I believe is for, oh god, I can't remember what game it's for now.

629
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:11,400
way to go unreal tournament that's right and um you can check this out at obeythetube.com

630
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:14,840
very cool very cool it's good thank you for following up on the mods it's cool

631
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:19,800
a couple quick news items here then we're going to get to the advice column uh the matrix online

632
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:26,440
is going down from nine servers to three they're scaling back to three servers starting august 2nd

633
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:31,640
i don't know that's probably a sign that it's not doing as well as they yeah they said that

634
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:35,940
the reason why they're scaling back is because there wasn't a lot of players on it one time

635
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:39,580
or whatever, so they're cutting them back. Two of the servers are going to be standard

636
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:41,920
servers, one of them is going to be a PVP server.

637
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:47,320
That's kind of sad to hear that Matrix Online, or the Matrix franchise in general has just

638
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,640
been going downhill.

639
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:51,680
Well, I don't know, maybe their servers can handle more people, and so they want more

640
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:55,800
people crammed into the city, because the city was huge, so it might just be the world's

641
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:56,800
too big.

642
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:02,860
see MTV they are going to have a category for the best video game

643
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:06,660
soundtrack as part of their upcoming video music awards what video game

644
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:09,760
soundtracks have to do with music videos I don't know but they're adding the

645
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:14,860
category anyway Tony Hawk's underground to Def Jam fight for New York Midnight

646
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:20,320
Club three dub edition Madden NFL 2005 and Dance Dance Revolution extreme all

647
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:25,900
nominated in this category yeah no it no acknowledgement for ultra mix too though

648
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:29,600
The Xbox version which arguably had the better soundtrack at least in my big fat opinion

649
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:35,460
All right. Anyway, um, oh one more. I want to do one more soundtrack story, then we'll get to the advice column

650
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:42,220
Namco museum, you know, they got this game the Namco museum 50th anniversary arcade collection. Well get this

651
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:47,220
They're actually gonna license music that you can kind of have as your soundtrack to go with this game

652
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:52,880
They're gonna license. Come on, Eileen lover boys working for the weekend fine young cannibals. She drives me crazy

653
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:57,800
crazy the romantics with talking in your sleep and Daz bands joystick are just

654
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:02,400
some of the titles that are being announced for the upcoming Namco Museum

655
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,320
and by the way Namco Museum is going to be a budget title it's going to be out

656
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:15,200
for only $19.95 but my question where's pac-man fever in all this where is it

657
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:21,760
but the quintessential Namco 80s tune come on people oh yes let's get to the

658
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:27,720
Actually, speaking of Namco, there was a 7-Up commercial in the 80s where someone was playing

659
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:32,240
Pac-Man and it played this song that sounds almost like Bette Davis' Eyes, except it's

660
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:36,520
Pac-Man chasing the ghost, stopping, getting all out of breath, dehydrated, and drinking

661
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:38,160
a 7-Up on screen.

662
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:41,520
Can you download that on one of those retro commercial websites?

663
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:45,480
I think so, but I think my fiancé has it on his computer, which is still not hooked

664
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:50,540
up because our house is still being unpacked, but if I can, I'll try to rip the audio out

665
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:51,540
of it.

666
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:58,540
Alright, now we here at Orange Lounge Radio, we're not just here to talk about video games all day long, which should be pretty evident tonight,

667
00:44:58,540 --> 00:45:01,540
but we're here to better your lives as well.

668
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:08,540
Because if we stayed home and played video games all day long, we'd have no time to go out and film commercials.

669
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:12,540
Which we've never done, but I just thought I'd throw that out there. We were willing to.

670
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:14,540
Much nicer than what I was thinking.

671
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:16,540
What were you thinking?

672
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:18,540
Forget it.

673
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:23,540
It's Dark Soccer's advice column, you know it by now. What are you going to talk to us about tonight?

674
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:27,540
Tonight's bit of advice is how to escape from a sinking car.

675
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:29,540
Okay.

676
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:33,540
This is like if you happen to drive your car off into the river or something.

677
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:37,540
Number one. Open the window as soon as possible.

678
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:41,540
Opening the window allows water to come in and equalize the pressure.

679
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:44,540
Two. If you cannot roll your windows down, break the glass.

680
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:47,540
Use your foot, shoulder, or heavy objects such as an anti-theft steering wheel lock.

681
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:52,580
lock. The club, the cops, they use it to escape from your car when it's under water.

682
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:58,500
Interesting. Three, get out as soon as you can. Floating time will range from a few seconds to a

683
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:04,660
few minutes. Four, if you are unable to open the window or break it, wait until the car fills with

684
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:09,300
water. When the water level reaches your head, take a deep breath and hold it. Now the pressure

685
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:12,740
should be equalized inside and outside and you should be able to open the door and swim to the

686
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:19,860
the service but you know my number one thing is you know hmm you know don't

687
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:25,700
drive after having that adios motherfucker I had one of those you don't

688
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:30,380
drive after that you will end up in the bay yeah don't drive into the bay people

689
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:33,900
unless you're playing driver 3 because that's about the only fun thing to do in

690
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:40,180
that game and just in I should go ahead and now since it's very obvious that I

691
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:46,700
have a source for my advice. The worst case scenario survival handbook is a wonderful

692
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:52,820
thing. It teaches you all kinds of ways to keep from getting trapped in an elevator and

693
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:57,260
controlling runaway camels. Very nice. They sell a calendar or something? I have a calendar.

694
00:46:57,260 --> 00:47:00,800
We should really plug them so we don't, they don't sue you. Yeah, I've been getting my

695
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:06,900
advice, but this is all stuff I knew anyway. Okay. You never know when you have to cross

696
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:11,820
a piranha infested river okay I'm gonna laugh I'm gonna laugh when these days

697
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:16,580
when someone actually I was on this runaway camel he saved my life thank you

698
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:20,020
orange lounge you know I'm waiting for the podcast alley votes this month

699
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:22,780
because we usually have a couple people that leave these smartass comments to

700
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:25,700
say like orange lounge taught me how to have a baby and like all these crazy

701
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:28,980
things which is cool so I'm looking forward to seeing those types of things

702
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:34,980
come up this next month when people can vote again yes all right every second

703
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:42,940
moving on rumble roses xx that's right all the rumble roses and that's coming

704
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:49,340
out on the Xbox 360 hmm why didn't they call this rumble roses xxx gee let me

705
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:52,940
think about this one for a little bit because that's basically what it will be

706
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:59,480
I saw pictures it's pretty and none of the customizable none of the existing

707
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:04,000
characters will be replaced fans of the series should check out changes to the

708
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,100
known roster before inquiring about new characters so they're gonna kind of

709
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:10,120
change but none of the characters are leaving supposedly so should be very

710
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:14,240
interesting it needs customizable characters they saying though that they

711
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:18,080
are not thinking about mud wrestling they want to do something else that's

712
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:23,680
stunning so I guess I haven't thought of it yet cream corn corn cream corn kids

713
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:31,680
cream corn brawn panty match it wasn't that what the whole game was anyway it's

714
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:35,560
completely different side of the spectrum here WB interactive will be

715
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:41,240
putting out a game on consoles and PC and it's called friends the one with all

716
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:46,920
the trivia that's right it's a game dedicated to friends trivia yes I saw

717
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:54,240
this it's sad Joey is your best friend moving on you will make him a ham

718
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:59,360
sandwich every morning please watch Joey somebody please watch it and buy him

719
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:05,040
hundreds of dollars in pants sorry that's the only episode I remember was

720
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:09,040
the subliminal message I I remember smelly cat that's about it but I don't

721
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:13,600
want to give that show any more time on this show midway midway is putting out a

722
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:17,680
sequel to The Suffering it's a sequel to the popular shooter called The Suffering

723
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:20,980
the ties that bind and they just wanted to let you all know that they landed some

724
00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:24,820
major Hollywood talent to be doing the voice acting Michael Clark Duncan

725
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:28,100
remember that guy who's in the Green Mile and the Planet of the Apes and

726
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:32,860
Daredevil he will be doing a villainous character in the game and Rachel Griffiths

727
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:37,540
who is in Six Feet Under and Hillary and Jackie and probably nobody that listens

728
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:40,980
to the show remembers this movie but I remember her at Muriel's wedding she's

729
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:45,060
going to be doing a role in this as well. So some big Hollywood talent coming to

730
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:49,500
The Suffering. Might add also The Suffering starts in three different ways

731
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:53,820
depending on how you ended the first game. Huh. Yeah. Or The Suffering starts

732
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:58,780
if you choose to buy a Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen game instead. Bad joke. Yeah.

733
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:07,460
Dark Soccer, you had another story for us? I sure do. I actually wanted Yahoo! UK put

736
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:21,660

737
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:24,700
will have heard of some of these games sorry UK listeners I just don't know

738
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:29,220
that it's very vector II okay then we have golden eyes 007 for the Nintendo

739
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:34,260

740
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:39,100
fans great game it was a great game but it did make me violently motion sick

741
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:45,220
next up we have Street Fighter 2 okay definitely hey version revolutionized

742
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:50,940
arcades absolutely Super Mario Kart for the Super Nintendo uh old favorite of

743
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:55,460
mine love it monkey island to let Chuck's revenge for the PC hell yeah

744
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:59,360
that's an interesting one to have in the top 10 a good choice but that's kind of

745
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:03,380
like that well that's number five okay what else number four Legend of Zelda

746
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:08,360
ocarina of time for the Nintendo 64 I know the hate mail is gonna come in but

747
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:11,840
ocarina of time was not as great of a game as everybody says it was no wasn't

748
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:15,520
this the Super Nintendo one was leaps and bounds better in my opinion but

749
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:19,240
maybe I just I can't get the 3d Zelda thing I don't know well I'm excited

750
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:23,120
apologize that one was number five oh sorry and listeners nevermind Rob

751
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:28,200
because he's on crack shut up hated it Super Nintendo one was the best shut up

752
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:33,240
moving on Pro Evolution Soccer 4 on the PlayStation 2 put up by Konami hmm

753
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:36,940
whoa soccer and not football

754
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:39,360
uh... your mike's going out again i don't know what's going on sorry

755
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:41,520
konami published it with soccer in the title

756
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:43,160
but it is football

757
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:44,000
okay

758
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,240
uh... number three

759
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:48,840
pokemon red and green

760
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:49,760
all right

761
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:53,240
okay there's a big audience for that and it reaches a lot of people so

762
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:56,120
pokey pokey

763
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:57,240
top two

764
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:01,160
number two super mario sixty four for the nintendo sixty four

765
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:02,480
that game was fun

766
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:09,160
Again the most overrated, but this is the thing with Nintendo 64 games their franchise games were incredibly overrated in my opinion

767
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:10,160
Goldeneye was a good game

768
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:12,000
It's described hmm

769
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:17,200
it says their childhood hero able to go anywhere and do anything to an extent that is purely magical and

770
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:24,080
Doesn't hold the candle to mario 3, but that's just my big fat opinion all right the number one game

771
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:30,240
Tetris for the Gameboy

772
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:35,440
No no pac-man anywhere in the top 10 which is considered the granddaddy

773
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:40,840
however DDR was number 50 at 49 interesting all right well Tetris and it

774
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:45,120
was right above afterburner which I honestly like better than DDR everybody

775
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:48,480
plays Tetris so I can't I can't argue with that as the number one choice I

776
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:52,520
really can't Tetris is the ultimate game to take on an airplane all right a

777
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:57,180
couple more stories for you guys we've had a bit of Konami news tonight we got

778
00:52:57,180 --> 00:53:03,060
another one they are partnering up with the American Idol franchise which is it

779
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:06,600

784
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:25,100

785
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:29,220
partnership you've got a franchise that will get this game a wide audience which

786
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:34,700
karaoke revolution deserves it's a great innovation on the product and konami is

787
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:38,700
bringing a good game to the American Idol name assuming now they're not saying

Wow all right moving on feel the magic you remember that game on the DS it's

793
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:10,700
kind of like a dating sim type game but it was like WarioWare mixed with sprung

794
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:14,980
I guess you could say feel the magic even though it wasn't the most hugely

795
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:20,300
popular game it's actually getting a sequel Famitsu magazine mentions that

00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:30,940
this is all we know about the game so far as the name Akachan wadoko kara kuru

798
00:54:30,940 --> 00:54:43,620
know which means where do babies come from yeah where do babies come from

799
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:47,100
Grand Theft Auto San Andreas's hot coffee mod?

800
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:48,100
Anyways.

801
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:52,060
You got another quick story before I get to tonight's last story.

802
00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:58,540
Like I hinted at earlier about the Nintendogs thing, selected members of Nintendo.com who

803
00:54:58,540 --> 00:55:04,660
are registered there will receive their copies of Nintendog on August 22nd, or before the

804
00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:09,700
August 22nd release date actually, and the rumor is it's probably going to be the people

805
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:13,700
that had the most usage of their forms.

806
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:16,700
Anyways. Lucky you people!

807
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:19,700
So yeah. Send me a copy. Alright.

808
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:23,700
And also one more thing, and it's not too much of a surprise since there's a lot of

809
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:26,700
instant messaging on the Xbox 360.

810
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:29,700
They're gonna have a QWERTY controller as well.

811
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:32,700
One of those ones with a stupid little keyboard on the bottom. Fun fun.

812
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:37,700
Interesting. Alright, one more story for you guys tonight. I promise you a Mac story.

813
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:44,700
story, here's your Mac story. If you are an OSX user, you must check this out. mikezornek.com.

814
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:53,020
That's m-i-k-e-z-o-r-n-e-k dot com slash coco, c-o-c-o-a, slash megaman effect. And what this

815
00:55:54,620 --> 00:56:01,140
is, this is an application so that when you launch an icon in OSX, it actually does the

816
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:08,140
megaman effect from megaman 2

817
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:09,700
so it's gonna be like

818
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:14,380
calculator exactly so every time you launch an application

819
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:16,220
the icon comes out

820
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:19,940
and you get the little megaman 2 info oh my god that'd be so annoying but i gotta put

821
00:56:19,940 --> 00:56:22,240
i would totally put that on my computer at home

822
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:26,020
are you saying you're gonna buy a mac i'm not gonna buy a mac for that fuck that

823
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:28,620
he'll port it

824
00:56:28,620 --> 00:56:31,500
All right, that would be so annoying.

825
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:32,680
They should do that with everything.

826
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:33,520
Tell me that's-

827
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:34,340
Hamburger!

828
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:35,180
Dude!

829
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:37,680
All right, that's it.

830
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:39,440
You guys, good job, by the way.

831
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:41,580
It's ironic we read that email about stats tonight

832
00:56:41,580 --> 00:56:44,020
because we damn near made an hour tonight.

833
00:56:44,020 --> 00:56:45,660
But that's what happens when you don't tape

834
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:48,060
a three hour show before doing the podcast, I guess.

835
00:56:48,060 --> 00:56:50,260
We have all kinds of energy.

836
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:51,100
That's right.

837
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:52,140
Making podcasts all night.

838
00:56:52,140 --> 00:56:54,420
You're not so dead sounding tonight, Dark Soccer.

839
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:55,740
No, I'm not!

840
00:56:55,740 --> 00:56:57,180
Oh my God, who is that?

841
00:56:57,180 --> 00:56:58,300
Guess what, guess what, guess what?

842
00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:00,720
You know what was brought to my attention? I'm a girl!

843
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:02,200
WOW!

844
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:04,500
Hey! Guess what? Who's at the door?

845
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:05,700
It's Pizza Man!

846
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:07,800
Do-do-do-do-dooooo!

847
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:13,200
Mailman! No!

848
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:16,100
Okay, god.

849
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:17,200
Alright, um...

850
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:19,200
And now it's time for the final thoughts!

851
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:21,900
Alright, just kidding. Just kidding, people.

852
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:23,800
Alright, uh, Loki, your final thought.

853
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:25,400
My final thought is...

854
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:29,840
I must play more star soldier and god damn it they better have my copy of

855
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:34,000
graffiti kingdom. Dark Sakura, besides getting your mic fixed what's your final

856
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:34,380
thought?

857
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:39,840
Sometimes the reason why I say I don't play any games during the week is because I have a life!

858
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:42,960
I work and I go to college! Sue me!

859
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:46,680
Somebody ruffled your feathers this week didn't we?

860
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:50,200
And my final thought...

861
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:53,480
I'm hungry so I'm gonna go have a pizza.

862
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:57,480
Maybe you should call him the pizza man!

863
00:57:57,480 --> 00:58:00,480
Goodbye everybody, thanks for tuning in, see you next time on the Orange Line.

Your table got all GTA on my elbow.

868
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:11,480
She got beat up by a pizza man!

869
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:15,480
Put down the joke, step away from the joke.

870
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:17,480
Hey, at least it's not, you know, cake pie anymore.

871
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:19,480
You guys are gonna be here next week even though I'm not, right?
