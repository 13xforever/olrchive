57270	63572	The following live program is a special presentation of Orange Lounge Radio.
72996	77257	Tonight on Orange Lounge Radio, live, it is episode number 150!
85680	87021	Which is a landmark number.
87622	93047	And to celebrate this landmark occasion, we're going to do the same old crap we always do.
93547	99112	We're going to sit on here and pretend to do a show about DDR and never talk about it throughout the whole three hours.
99292	104477	And we'll find out what the difference between white bread and rustic white bread actually is.
104497	104978	That's right.
105038	107160	Orange Lounge Radio bringing you the news you really want to know.
107992	110573	about games that we're supposed to be talking about, but we're not.
110974	112214	For the past 150 episodes.
112234	112454	No.
113035	119658	In all seriousness, we have brand new MP3s from Happy Sky for those three of you people who haven't already torrented them.
120458	124981	We have some news on something I wanted to say.
125001	125841	Oh, the lawsuit.
125881	131364	There's more stuff about the lawsuit because we didn't get bitched at enough for talking about the lawsuit too much last week.
131784	134546	All this and more tonight after this brief introduction.
134606	136987	Yada, yada, yada, yada, yada, yada, yada.

252029	253811	We are live!
254151	261116	And this is episode number 150 for this July the 17th, 2005.

274987	280632	We're plugged in and fully interactive through our website, www.orangeloungeradio.com.
281233	282293	My name is Rob Roberts.
282333	283494	You might know me as Sky.
284015	286177	Joining me, as always, are my awesome co-hosts.
286517	290841	In this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm is Jamie Summers, also known as DarkSakura.
296118	297619	Actually, she's not here right now.
297699	305663	She, in true Orange Lounge Radio fashion, whenever we have like a really big show number, like a landmark show, she's off doing something else.
305923	310345	She will be here tonight, boys and girls, she'll just be a little late, because there's a birthday in the family.
311226	319830	I think it's grandma or aunt or somebody's having a birthday, so she's off there, but she'll be here around the 7 o'clock hour, so she's probably on her way right now.
320550	322871	But we do have the one and only Tech Massa Loki!
323752	324312	I am here.
325153	325833	And how are you doing?
326446	327887	Um, okay, I guess.
328067	329909	I know, did you go on a diet or something?
330529	330729	No.
330770	333191	Because you used to bring in the Pizza Hut every night.
333211	333632	Pizza yesterday.
333832	335173	And now you brought in the Togos.
335313	336114	I had pizza yesterday.
336134	336374	Oh, I see.
336674	336934	I see.
337695	338015	Alright.
338536	342919	Well, we do have the one and only, uh, Loki's fianc√© with us tonight.
343139	343439	Hi.
344480	347743	So she's gonna fill in for Jamie, giving us the female perspective.
348363	350825	Hello, I'm Jamie, I hope she's not listening.
351125	351626	No, she's not.
351866	355909	But, I have to know, um, what are your favorite video games?
360726	361567	I don't know, Matt.
361907	362407	Tetris?
362727	363708	Yeah, Tetris!
364308	365149	I like Tetris.
365169	366229	She also likes Zookeeper.
366729	368771	Yes, and I like Zookeeper and I like Pac-Man.
369331	370431	What do you think of DDR?
373153	375594	It kind of looks like line dancing.
376315	380957	Because when you have the two people and there's... It kind of does, don't you think?
381718	382358	Kind of.
382698	383158	Kind of.
383579	386040	Because you just have to do little heel clicking.
387281	389302	Oh yes, it's going to be a fun show tonight, boys and girls.
390578	392539	We'll be back after this brief introduction.
392559	396680	We're going to play some MP3s from the new Happy Sky soundtrack.
396720	397420	Happy Sky!
397640	399121	Does that make you a Happy Sky?
399621	403662	No, actually, I'll tell you what I think about 2DX12 style in a little bit.
404022	404442	Okay.
405923	407583	I do like this first song we're going to play.
407623	410024	We're going to start it off with a remix of Thunder.
411525	414346	A new DJ Taka song from Happy Sky.
414766	416386	Oh, not the same Thunder I thought it was.
416946	418347	No, but it's that...
421805	423467	You know the one everybody used to play on ASL?
423507	424348	Such a horrid song.
424629	425250	Such a horrid song.
425290	426471	Well, they remixed it for Happy Sky.
427012	427613	We're going to play that.
428715	429035	You'll see.
429075	429396	You'll see.
429476	430618	You're the recognizer or you don't.
430978	431639	Inazuma.
431699	432541	We'll be back after this.
584747	585149	Thank you.
649842	653366	Thanks for watching!
710038	710948	Thanks for watching!
832578	833479	Thanks for watching!
893885	900967	Thank you for watching!
926212	930790	And as a homosexual, I'm going to say Happy Sky is the gayest name I've ever heard.
931372	931673	Sorry.
932984	935466	Super Happy American Dad's Party!
935486	940710	In that break, we heard DJ Taco with Inazuma, which is a remix of Thunder.
940730	944792	And I got bitched at in the chatroom because, you know, Jazz came in and was like, Nuh-uh!
945013	946434	You did not just bash on Thunder!
946454	946794	Nuh-uh!
946854	947334	No, you didn't!
947895	949616	And, um, okay, I like Thunder.
949896	950537	I like it a lot.
950617	954539	But let's face it, that song was horrid when 2DX8Style was that.
954579	955920	It was that and Beauty of Silence.
956321	957682	And I love Beauty of Silence, too.
958442	959723	But those songs were all horrid.
960284	960384	So...
961104	968172	Sorry, I was having trouble paying attention to those songs because Nelly here keeps trying to violate me with this stupid Ethernet cable.
968192	968873	Hey, hey, hey, hey.
969313	971215	Stop sticking that Cat5 up his pants.
971315	975119	We've got to put that... I stuck it up Rob's butt a minute ago and he didn't even notice it.
976881	977762	Did you, Rob?
977922	979204	Can I try and do the show here, please?
979224	979464	Sorry.
979664	979965	Alright.
981309	995396	After that break, also in that set, Ryu with In Motion, Mr. T with Vault of Heaven, and the one more extra stage, oh my gods, Amuro vs. Killer with Mei, which means dark in Japanese.
996037	996937	You know what else it means?
997117	999378	It means, I made the same song three times!
999458	1000179	That's what it means.
1001119	1004361	Let me just run my hand up and down the piano again.
1004381	1006222	Seriously, it's the same damn beat!
1006302	1008703	Oh, I made a song with piano in it!
1008723	1010184	Here, I'm going to run my hand up and down the piano.
1010956	1011696	Oh wait, no, that's not the part.
1013017	1019481	Where's the part that has the... Here we go.
1019641	1021222	See?
1021602	1031887	And you know that's just going to be key presses all over the place, and people are only going to be able to beat it by putting it on random unless you're just insane at 2DX, which, you know, if that's the case, then more power to you.
1034649	1034869	Anyway.
1035484	1035805	I don't know.
1036145	1040651	Me personally, I haven't really sat down and listened to all the Happy Sky MP3s.
1041032	1041773	I'm not cool.
1041933	1043535	I didn't get the MP3s earlier in the week.
1043635	1046740	I just got them last night, so I haven't had a chance to listen to all of them.
1047160	1049984	But the ones I did listen to, I was kind of like...
1051954	1053255	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1069874	1071156	Even with 2DX Red, I was kind of...
1093447	1094928	2DX is going the way of Guitar Freaks
1122377	1125399	It was some cool song, or crappy song, I mean.
1126640	1131703	And, um, so now, um, I don't know, The Killer sounds like something like a metal band.
1132184	1135926	And that would have been awesome, like, you know, heavy metal guitars with the piano, I guess.
1136086	1136967	I think that would have been cool.
1137227	1139268	But that was, what did he do?
1139568	1141510	The Killer's like, I'm gonna speed the tempo up.
1141630	1142210	Look, I'm done.
1142851	1143231	That was it.
1143351	1144171	That was my contribution.
1146893	1147574	I don't know.
1147914	1148034	Yeah.
1149264	1151466	All right, anyway, so that's my rant on Happy Sky.
1151486	1154668	It's like, you honestly wonder, yeah, we need one more extra stage song.
1155028	1155188	Ugh!
1156489	1161693	Fine, let's take a piece of that, piece of that, speed it up, up, done.
1161733	1164895	There are a couple songs in 2DX Happy Sky I do kind of like.
1165915	1168417	I liked the Thunder remix because I loved the original Thunder.
1168537	1170619	Even though it was horrid, so horrid.
1170779	1172120	Yeah, I liked it until she started singing.
1173240	1175042	That's the part that comes from Thunder.
1175542	1176983	The rest of it's all different.
1177083	1178204	Oh, yeah, that's why.
1182455	1188498	That would be like having the intro part there and then also let the move breaks in there.
1188518	1189838	It just doesn't fit.
1190199	1191219	It's the same with that.
1191619	1198203	You know, remember Ultramix 2 and it had a remix of Make a Jam, which wasn't bad.
1198543	1200444	It was actually kind of cool, the Make a Jam remix.
1200464	1200944	You remember that?
1201624	1204446	Somebody could remix Let Them Move and make it a good song.
1204486	1205246	They really could.
1205326	1206407	It's just nobody wants to.
1207384	1207884	or something.
1208124	1208324	Yeah.
1208344	1210305	No, Let Them Move could be remixed into a good song.
1210365	1210625	Please.
1210946	1215667	If they could make Make a Jam a good song, Let Them Move remix for Ultramix 3.
1216308	1216648	Please.
1216668	1217088	Yeah, yeah.
1217408	1219309	And Michael Jackson can make a comeback too.
1219389	1219869	That's right.
1222310	1222670	All right.
1224031	1227953	We'll start off tonight's show as we usually like to start off the show playing a little bit of How was your week?
1227993	1228653	How was your day?
1229433	1230674	Loki, how was your week?
1230714	1231134	How was your day?
1232114	1232634	It sucks.
1233855	1236356	It started off good and then it just ended up crappy.
1237043	1238424	I had to go do that.
1238504	1239845	Luckily, ironically enough or whatever...
1265109	1267370	The air conditioning stopped working in our apartment.
1268750	1277474	Luckily, we're in another house, so it doesn't really matter right now, but... No, this is the second time it's happened since we've lived there, so... That's not good.
1277674	1279635	And then, um... What else?
1279775	1279875	Oh!
1281335	1284336	Yeah, the dog is on this weird routine, because my mom works weird hours.
1284376	1286037	She works, you know, really early in the morning.
1286577	1289879	Gives up, like, four in the morning, so the dog wakes me up three times during the night.
1289939	1293420	It's like, once at eleven, once at three...
1294168	1302092	once at 7, and then once at 10, it's just like, knock it off, and like, she'll wake you up, and you're like, okay, you want to go outside?
1302592	1319741	Nope, just staring at you, just, I don't want anything, I just wanted to wake you up, it's fucking annoying, so, that sucked, and then, I don't know, really, other than that, not too much has been going on at work, it's been okay, I've been just kind of
1321016	1326381	Trying to pay attention to work as much as possible and not, you know, fiddle with my PSP.
1327102	1330525	Because people want me to put games on there because they outed me as saying it.
1330645	1333988	Oh yeah, that guy knows how to put Nintendo games on your PSP.
1334468	1337071	So everybody calls it, or walks up to me, are you busy?
1338252	1339273	Put games on it.
1341315	1342496	So I have to constantly do that.
1343257	1345779	But, you know, it's cool, you know.
1346385	1351146	I think it's wonderful that you work for the game distributor and you're a big old pirate when it comes to things like that.
1351206	1352006	I mean, seriously.
1352526	1358708	There are pirates inside every company and they wonder why this stuff turns up on the internet days after release.
1358728	1359588	I don't pirate games.
1361068	1361309	Much.
1361329	1363949	I don't pirate any games.
1364909	1366630	I'm not the person that puts them on the internet.
1366770	1368390	I'm just the person that downloads them off the internet.
1368410	1369771	And shares them with all your coworkers.
1369971	1374232	I don't... Okay, I share the Nintendo games with them, but you know what?
1375372	1376052	They're so small.
1376923	1378984	It's like, I don't know.
1379004	1380645	Loki, Loki, are you busy?
1380685	1381965	Could you come rob a bank with me?
1382785	1387327	These other games that I'm testing out are just games that aren't coming out over here yet.
1387487	1388948	It's all Japanese games on my PSP.
1389228	1393490	By the way, I should say that my PSP has four commercial games on the memory card itself.
1394871	1396231	Your internet penis is huge.
1396271	1396991	Congratulations.
1397432	1398492	Thank you.
1399633	1403794	And, yeah, so that's pretty much my week.
1404194	1405395	It's been just that, so...
1407570	1408791	Oh, I forgot.
1409332	1411794	Yesterday we had our bad movie night.
1411814	1412374	It was pretty cool.
1414556	1417118	It came from somewhere else, which was really retarded.
1417318	1422342	All the gore and nudity scenes were all in color, but the rest of the movie was black and white.
1422922	1427166	And then we started watching this movie called Hanzo the Razor or something like that.
1427686	1434271	And I highly recommend no one watches this, because I thought, okay, samurai exploitation movie or something like that.
1434792	1436313	It was made in the 70s or whatever.
1437364	1439906	and Hanzo's like torturing himself, you know, first.
1440246	1450414	Then all of a sudden, out of nowhere, he's pouring hot water on his penis and then puts it on a Lego board and starts beating it with a stick and then starts screwing a bag of rock salt.
1450454	1452575	I was like, what the hell are you watching?
1452996	1454557	Why did you make me watch this?
1454997	1458740	And the whole movie, I read the back, I'm like, oh my god, why are we watching this thing?
1458760	1463884	So we turn that off and then we watch Attack the Gas Station, which that movie is awesome.
1463964	1466005	So, it ended on a good note.
1466326	1466746	And, um,
1467714	1469856	Yeah, Hanzo the Razor, don't watch it.
1470216	1470676	Awful movie.
1472297	1472998	That was my week.
1475339	1476320	Alright, sounds good.
1479843	1480903	Who made you watch that movie?
1481344	1482044	My friend Jason.
1482224	1484566	He brought it over, he said this movie's awesome.
1484646	1485487	He didn't even watch it.
1485527	1486047	I'm like, dude.
1486067	1488229	And we're like, oh, come on.
1488589	1494893	I mean, he didn't even, like, showed it, but it was kind of blurred out, you know, out of focus.
1494953	1495454	But he's just all...
1497102	1498383	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1514958	1517780	Ugly damn people in this movie, but no one wanted to watch it.
1517800	1518781	Santa Claus saves the day.
1518881	1522803	Have I ever made you watch Desperate Living, one of my favorite movies, John Waters?
1523063	1523223	No.
1523484	1527886	With the amazingly humongous black woman that's like full-frontally nude through a lot of the movie?
1527926	1530888	You know, I probably would enjoy the movie just because I enjoy weird movies.
1530908	1531229	It's awesome.
1531249	1531749	Something like that.
1531869	1533430	It's like one of my favorite movies ever.
1534291	1535571	Well, there's another one I'm getting.
1535591	1538593	I haven't paid for it yet, but it's inbred.
1539134	1541055	Or is it Bloodsucking Vampire Rednecks?
1541955	1542796	That's going to be coming.
1542876	1543677	If you look up the...
1544932	1552361	Well, let me just say there's this really ginormous person in this movie that's nude in it as well, and she must weigh like 600 pounds.
1552541	1553182	I kid you not.
1553242	1556005	You know, you and I need to go to that Trash Film Orgy sometime.
1556085	1556726	Oh my god.
1556746	1560310	They do this thing here in Sacramento where, you know, we all live and the show's based...
1560530	1566851	They do this trash film orgy at the big artsy theater downtown and they show all these really horrid, horrid movies.
1567231	1574093	Well, this old friend of mine that I used to do Rocky Horror with way back in the day, she is like the trash film queen or whatever.
1574473	1584295	Well, I'm surfing MySpace yesterday and I see this picture and it says the trash film queen and all it is is a picture of breasts with stickers taping over it.
1584355	1586195	I'm like, dude, that's Sarah!
1586215	1586275	Yes!
1588496	1588816	Yes!
1590695	1596440	But the scary thing is, I recognized a picture of a girl from the breasts alone and nothing else.
1596700	1597641	That's pretty odd.
1597681	1601224	Yeah, but those are huge-ass tits, so you can see them from... She's awesome, though.
1601284	1601564	Anyway.
1601744	1609371	Anyways, I just wanted... I know this is great radio, but I wanted to show you a picture of this woman that's in this movie.
1609531	1615296	And this is the reason why... This movie is just so awful, but let me see here.
1615316	1617057	There it is right there.
1621294	1624875	She basically sits on some guy's head and it, like, kills him.
1625575	1626716	That's what I look like naked.
1626736	1627156	See, look at that.
1629437	1631838	Okay, so can you post a link in our chatroom to that?
1631858	1632098	Oh, yeah.
1632178	1634038	No, you're not in the chatroom, are you?
1634238	1635739	I'm not in the chatroom.
1635759	1641541	Just look it up on somethingawful.com, go under their movie reviews and look for blood-sucking vampire rednecks.
1642361	1643963	and go to page 4.
1645124	1649488	I love reading SomethingAwful.com's movie reviews because they're hilarious.
1649988	1652470	But anyways, yeah, it's nasty.
1654692	1659977	You know, it's kind of like last week when I was trying to show all the videos on air.
1661378	1663801	You trying to go in and show people the...
1666043	1680349	Yeah, it's like if you were to take some really nasty biker woman at an eye patch and her leg is like the size of an elephant, that would probably be an accurate description.
1681690	1684371	Seriously, that's... Anyways, I'm done.
1685111	1686532	Don't lie, you know you think she's hot.
1686772	1688713	Oh yeah, I want to do her folds.
1692406	1693948	Speaking of videos that we play.
1693988	1697712	Common behavior years ago can now be sexual harassment.
1698513	1699974	Smells like vagina in here.
1700875	1701716	My vagina?
1701997	1704299	Smells like fresh vagina in here.
1705481	1707503	Are you talking about my vagina?
1708524	1708964	Maybe.
1709545	1709805	Anyway.
1711087	1712088	Nellie, how was your week?
1712128	1712789	How was your day?
1714989	1729283	It was the same as Matt's, except I watched that video and that was pretty funny, and I showed it to my co-worker, and she told me a funny story about how she had sex with this guy, but not really, where he kind of slipped and he entered in between her butt cheeks.
1729323	1731685	You know we have children that listen to this program.
1732426	1732846	Keep talking.
1733026	1734428	That's what my week was like.
1734488	1736570	It was like talking about funny shit like that.
1737250	1740113	So it was wonderful, and today was great because I got laid.
1744881	1748303	Ironically enough, so did I. No.
1749904	1751104	Bugged just joined us.
1751925	1754986	My old friend Bugged, who's known me longer than most people.
1755707	1758348	Yes, and I feel like I don't know you anymore.
1759169	1759869	Why is that?
1760289	1761190	Because these freaks.
1762310	1767313	The chatroom is telling me I'm not actually gay because of the fact that I was able to ID a woman based on her tits.
1767893	1768714	They're saying I'm not gay.
1768734	1773196	No, no, no, that has nothing to do with... Bugged has known I was gay longer than I have, actually.
1773216	1773296	Yep.
1774955	1775355	It's true!
1777638	1778218	Alright, anyway.
1778559	1779079	How was your week?
1779099	1779560	How was your day?
1779720	1780981	Not as exciting as anyone else's.
1781221	1782002	Did you get laid today?
1782122	1782262	No.
1782502	1782963	That's too bad.
1786626	1788268	We've got to make them blush, not us.
1788729	1791852	What was Rob like when he was just this little whore?
1792512	1792692	What?
1793860	1795321	I was never a little whore.
1795341	1796502	You must specify it, Dan.
1796582	1797483	I'm a younger whore.
1797523	1803667	I didn't lose my virginity until I was like 20 years old, but you have to remember I had all these issues going on at the same time.
1804328	1805368	Andrea issues?
1806429	1808491	Talk about my ex-girlfriend on the air.
1809071	1810452	We're famous on the internet.
1810472	1811913	She might listen for God's sake.
1812193	1812413	No.
1812894	1814155	I'm just looking at Loki's screen.
1814235	1814635	Stop.
1814895	1815235	Stop.
1815616	1815876	Yeah.
1816236	1816656	Stop.
1818318	1819038	You're horrible.
1820479	1821260	That's why you keep me around.
1824241	1826183	Anyway, now I lost my train of thought.
1826284	1826604	Forget it.
1827385	1829107	Now my week wasn't exciting to anyone else.
1829147	1830048	I know what I was going to say.
1830128	1834253	If you're still 20, 21, and you haven't lost your virginity, it might just be because you're gay.
1834854	1836156	No, I'm kidding.
1836176	1836496	I'm kidding.
1836516	1837317	I'm totally kidding you guys.
1838018	1839279	But I had all those issues.
1840901	1841402	Stop it.
1842223	1842964	Was that your problem, Matt?
1852179	1854819	My plate caused the deaths of thousands of people.
1856140	1856960	That's a great story.
1857000	1859940	You should tell it on air.
1860100	1861101	That's why it took so long.
1861121	1862961	Because I was like, do I like pussy?
1863021	1863781	Actually, no, I don't.
1864061	1866101	I kind of like guys.
1866221	1867442	Everybody likes pussy.
1867942	1870942	My hands smell like tuna.
1871262	1873083	Anything else you want to say about your week and your day?
1874323	1875183	It's fucking hot.
1876063	1876323	It is.
1876783	1877963	Is the AC on in here?
1878124	1878504	I don't know.
1879524	1879864	I don't know.
1879904	1880424	You live here.
1883131	1883971	Your TV's running.
1884892	1885312	Oh, that's true.
1885332	1886332	And nobody's out there watching it?
1886512	1886693	No.
1886813	1887953	No, that was my week and my day.
1888433	1896356	As of like an hour and a half ago, I just purchased a new HDTV, a 30-inch HDTV, because I wanted it.
1898197	1899037	Must be nice.
1899757	1900478	Well, here's the thing.
1900538	1903019	I have some extra money right now because this is a three-paycheck month.
1903379	1906620	And so I was deciding, do I want to get a PowerBook or do I want to get...
1907160	1907981	and a new TV.
1908261	1911923	And I was going to get the PowerBook, but then my friend said, oh, it'll take six weeks to get here.
1911983	1916025	I'm like, fuck that, because I'm going to the East Coast, because I'm going to get the discount, because my friend works for Apple.
1916426	1917626	But it would take six weeks to get there.
1917666	1921368	And I said, well, fuck that, because I'm going to Pennsylvania in two weeks, and that's what I want my laptop for.
1921729	1923069	So I'm just going to use my parents' shitty old video.
1923089	1924990	How is this whole nexus with Pennsylvania?
1925931	1926291	I don't know.
1926331	1927652	It's just this void where I get sucked into.
1927672	1928713	My roommates just moved there.
1928813	1930093	My new roommates are from there.
1930854	1932855	You're bouncing through there.
1933849	1963453	Yeah, I know, it's weird I feel sorry for everyone in Pennsylvania So anyway, I really want to get a PowerBook But it'll wait until the end of the year Because I also really want a TV So I'm getting the TV first Instinct gratification But get this, the TV, it's not bad I got it at Costco, only $600 No shit Yeah, not bad for HDTV The picture's pretty good You should see a DVD on that thing Pop in the Xbox, put it on widescreen Looks hot Mom's looking for a new TV But I have to set up her TiVo tomorrow
1965583	1966864	I have to set up her new TiVo tomorrow.
1984724	1988546	You can join our chat room, www.orangeloungeradio.com Or not.
1988866	1989306	On chat.
1989366	1989946	No, join it.
1989986	1990506	It's a good time.
1991267	1992507	And I've got some comments here.
1992567	1998070	Somebody is saying, somebody is shaking their fist at me because they're 28 and still a virgin.
1998510	1999270	Dude, it's all right.
1999290	1999930	You know what?
2000010	2002551	Let me give you the truth about sex, okay?
2003552	2004112	Oh, this should be good.
2004352	2007513	Once you have it, you always want it.
2007934	2008914	Is it a boy or a girl?
2009074	2010915	Seriously, don't lose a boy.
2011604	2013225	Oh, I'll tell you why you're still a virgin.
2013445	2013746	Why?
2013766	2015267	Because you're in that chat room.
2015907	2016588	Stop it!
2016648	2017909	He's a nice guy.
2017989	2018469	Stop it.
2019650	2021952	I'm sorry if you're nice.
2022012	2024534	Hey, hey, our chat room gets people laid.
2027796	2030258	Look, I'll tell you what, once you have it, you always want it.
2030338	2032439	So stay a virgin until you're 40, honestly.
2036089	2036669	What else is there?
2037850	2040091	Somebody wants to know if there's an Apple store here in Sacramento.
2040111	2049376	Yes, there is, and I was just there today because my roommate, his extifer, is having a birthday on Tuesday, and his parents got him a gift card for the Apple store, and he went and bought an iPod.
2049737	2057541	But the little bastard, for the same price I bought my iPod for, like, what, in December, he got a color iPod.
2058401	2059822	I got mine for $190, 20 gig.
2060122	2060763	Fucking Apple.
2061903	2063284	Fucking price cuts.
2064209	2065690	He should have paid more than what I pay.
2065750	2066290	It's not fair.
2067990	2069751	Which pay?
2069931	2069751	300?
2070311	2069751	300.
2070331	2071192	300.
2070351	2071192	And that's what he paid today.
2071212	2071952	And he got a color one.
2071972	2073232	I got a 20 gig black and white.
2073492	2074533	He got a 20 gig color.
2074793	2078094	So he's like, and of course he has to come in here and show me, Look, Rob!
2078574	2080955	I have album art on my iPod!
2081475	2083156	I look at my iPod twice a day.
2084256	2086177	The rest of the time it resides in my armrest.
2089558	2089799	Anyway.
2090579	2091379	The rest of my week and my day.
2091699	2093540	I saw Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.
2094025	2095766	Where the hell was the elevator?
2122549	2123610	The Elevator was in the first movie.
2123630	2124290	It was in the very end.
2124330	2125811	Not as prominently as it was in the book.
2125871	2126591	Exactly, exactly.
2126891	2128932	And just the songs were different.
2129052	2131913	And Veruca Salt's whole scene was completely different.
2132193	2135815	But some people like that because she had the whole, I want it now.
2136255	2138136	She had her whole little song and some people loved that.
2138156	2139577	And that's not in the new movie.
2139917	2141617	And that drives some people crazy.
2141898	2144299	But I'm telling you, the new movie is awesome.
2144559	2145039	I loved it.
2145159	2146079	I highly recommend it.
2147180	2149741	The reason why I liked it, one of the reasons why I liked it is because Johnny Depp,
2150307	2151588	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2179264	2183085	See, like, the songs are just, like, nutty in this one.
2183125	2186106	Like, they range from that little, like, weird ballad thing.
2186126	2188267	Before Christmas was, you know...
2202692	2205394	Danny Elfman did all the songs, so it's like Oingo Boingo revisited.
2205454	2207795	He sung it all and did the whole nine yards of that.
2208136	2210697	But then some of the songs are way different.
2210717	2212598	Then Veruca's Salt song is like a ballad.
2216041	2216961	Anyway, I liked the movie.
2216981	2217321	It was cool.
2217361	2218362	I stopped the lighter for that one.
2219723	2220183	Go see it.
2220243	2220964	I highly recommend it.
2221004	2221404	It was good.
2221904	2225807	Don't go in expecting Gene Wilder or Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory because that's not what you're going to get.
2226067	2228729	But if you read the books as a kid, you're going to be very pleased.
2228829	2230009	What about Johnny Depp as a pirate?
2232188	2233649	But Johnny Depp doesn't play a pirate in this.
2233709	2237973	I heard his inspiration for this movie was Marilyn Manson, which kind of makes sense.
2238473	2239294	No, he said no.
2239534	2241596	He said it was the original movie.
2242116	2244278	No, it can't be because he's nothing like Charlie.
2244298	2245178	It was Michael Jackson.
2245218	2246499	We know it's Michael Jackson.
2246539	2247620	He's just not admitting to it.
2247660	2248261	No, it can't be.
2249096	2251817	It can't be Michael Jackson because, hey, DarkSakura's here.
2252417	2257298	His inspiration can't be Michael Jackson because Michael Jackson loves kids almost a little too much.
2257878	2262560	And in this movie, Johnny Depp hated children, and that's what made it so amazingly wonderful.
2263740	2264460	That's why I liked it.
2264720	2265961	Hi, DarkSakura, you're here.
2267381	2273563	In classic Orange Lounge fashion, you're tardy to a landmark episode number.
2274023	2274423	I'm kidding.
2274903	2275243	Huh?
2275543	2276143	I'm just kidding.
2276784	2278224	I was doing Grandma Doody.
2278701	2278961	Sorry.
2279181	2279982	Whose birthday was it?
2280002	2280622	I couldn't remember.
2280702	2282683	Dan's grandmother's 70th birthday.
2282703	2283623	Dan's grandma's 70th birthday.
2283643	2285003	So I was in Granite Bay.
2285924	2287624	In like John L. Sullivan's neighborhood.
2287764	2291046	Granite Bay is like the Mormon central of Northern California.
2291086	2292406	It's also where rich people go.
2292806	2293907	And they form colonies.
2294247	2294887	There's no difference.
2296708	2298128	Okay.
2298248	2301330	We went to a school that had half of Granite Bay in it.
2303190	2307772	So the parking lot was like Bugs, old Mustangs, and then Mercedes and BMWs.
2308351	2310653	I felt very ill the whole time I was there.
2311354	2312234	It was not too funny.
2312294	2313235	You didn't go to Wendy's, did you?
2313375	2314016	My brother works there.
2315077	2319100	No, we had like, like, gourmet chicken.
2319160	2319440	Ooh.
2320301	2322523	And, hey, it landed the right way.
2324464	2328728	And ribs and all kinds of rich people food.
2330609	2331630	Did you have hors d'oeuvres?
2332431	2332591	No.
2332691	2334132	Did you have... I had cheese.
2334192	2336394	What's rich, white, snobby people food?
2336434	2336835	Did you have...
2338294	2346222	DarkSakura, you're here just in time.
2346262	2346703	How was your week?
2346723	2347864	How was your day, my friend?
2351708	2352790	I played some PSO.
2353590	2354051	That was it.
2355833	2356654	Seriously, that was it.
2358408	2363190	I got really bored, my computer decided to die, I put those stupid Windows updates on it, and I'm so ready to get a Mac.
2364351	2366632	I'm getting tired of all this Microsoft bullshit.
2366652	2368172	Come to the light side.
2368773	2369213	No!
2370373	2381178	You know what, you need to get off of your little I hate Mac piece of shit, because you know what, they're really good computers if... You don't know jack about computers, that's what they're good for, is if you don't want to do anything.
2381698	2384559	No, they're more for the people who are specialists in their fields.
2384639	2385780	Wow, they rock at gaming too.
2386325	2392249	You can also put a bunch of Macs together and get a lot more processing power out of them.
2392849	2393970	I'm warming up to Macs.
2395030	2395591	I want one.
2396111	2398473	But I'm not going to play games on it.
2398573	2399613	I want it for audio.
2399693	2403296	If I want to play games, I get myself a G5 and put Virtual PC on it.
2403336	2404997	I can play any game I want to and a story.
2405417	2407258	And on top of that, I have a system that's good for graphics.
2410840	2411461	This needs to move.
2412041	2412461	What is this?
2412942	2413402	Oh, sorry.
2414423	2414883	Anyway.
2418722	2425906	I do admit that there's a lot of really stupid Mac users out there who are ultimately clueless because it actually can do a bunch of stuff for you.
2426366	2427686	And then there's, like, the smart people.
2429407	2433229	So I think, like, the middle-of-the-line people, the mediocre people are all PC.
2433949	2437111	Are you still thinking of Macintoshes as what we used in high school, though?
2437151	2438131	Maybe that's the problem.
2438511	2438872	No.
2439272	2439732	No, not you.
2439972	2440732	I mean Loki.
2441673	2441813	No.
2442013	2444174	That's because he's inflexible and won't learn to adjust.
2445447	2447109	Oh, I understand flexible.
2447189	2447589	All right.
2466215	2467516	I think we're going to go to a break.
2467876	2470839	Next thing you'll say is, you know, in the groove, it's just as good as DDR.
2471099	2472800	Oh, I want to talk about... No, no, no, no, no.
2473421	2475382	I go for innovation, not stupidity.
2476243	2478525	I want to talk about the lawsuit, just for a little bit.
2478545	2483349	The chatroom got mad at us because we talked about it too much last week, but I want to say there's a little bit, there's a little bit of news going on, so I want to talk about that.
2483709	2485911	Oh, the chatroom got upset.
2486071	2486591	Oh, no.
2487532	2489694	You know, the chatroom also needs to learn how to be flexible, too.
2491215	2492395	All right, we'll be back after this.
2492895	2499257	In this break, I want to play a new song from the new Katamari Damacy game, because I got some rips from it, so we're going to play this one.
2499817	2502758	I haven't even listened to any of them yet, but this one's called Katamari Holiday.
2502798	2503438	How bad could it be?
2504618	2505638	It's a holiday song.
2505658	2508099	They need Katamari Damacy the movie.
2508239	2512100	Katamari Damacy did have the track You Are Smart, the one that gave me splitting headaches.
2512280	2513380	Well, we'll see how this one is.
2513420	2515941	We'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.
2518996	2520417	Thank you for watching!
2547666	2552710	I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you

2659938	2669182	For dream of you, the ripples of the dream, the feeling of the wind, are various colors.

2795096	2803900	It's been a long, long, long time since I've been with you.
2803960	2806882	It's been a long, long, long time since I've been with you.
2821883	2822744	Thanks for watching!
2857561	2862905	Orange Lounge Radio, Mamani Music, and more.
2863105	2865787	Howdy boys and girls, we're back with more Orange Lounge Radio.
2865827	2868309	Hope you enjoyed that rather long song from Katamari Damacy.
2868349	2874233	But dammit, we just wanted to see if the music in the second game would be just as good as the first game.
2874433	2875854	It was okay.
2875954	2878136	I probably didn't play the best song.
2878176	2881358	I just picked a good sounding one because I honestly haven't had time to listen to the whole soundtrack.
2881398	2882759	So I just picked one with a good name.
2883179	2884300	So maybe I didn't pick the right one.
2885359	2885999	We are back.
2886720	2890301	We'll talk a little more about the DDR and some of the other games we've been playing.
2891541	2892022	What the hell?
2892082	2893882	The chat room over at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
2893902	2894402	Click on chat.
2894422	2896763	They're saying I sound like Cookie from You Don't Know Jack.
2897123	2899464	And this is not the first time this subject has been brought up.
2899984	2901285	I don't know what they're talking about.
2901605	2908748	I've played You Don't Know Jack, like the first one, but I... Then there's like You Don't Know Jack, like every type of edition under the sun.
2908768	2910849	There was like, you know, You Don't Know Jack.
2913049	2913670	Monkey edition.
2913730	2914010	I don't know.
2914070	2914730	It's crazy stuff.
2915635	2915715	D.D.R.
2915755	2915915	World
2932166	2939432	DDR Freak likes to play the smoking gun in these types of situations and they dig up the legal documents and post them on the website for everybody to see.
2939492	2946117	So you can head on over to ddrfreak.com and you too can check out the amended complaint against Red Octane and Mad Catz.
2946498	2948699	So everybody can try to be a lawyer.
2948820	2949420	Yay!
2950601	2954804	Which just makes the forums light up with blah blah blah blah blah blah.
2954844	2955585	I think I'm a lawyer.
2956421	2962967	I know that this, this, this, and I know this, this, this, and the real fact of the matter is nobody knows shit unless you've been to law school.
2963568	2965570	So, it's just interesting.
2965610	2968212	Everybody's kind of got their own opinion on this whole thing going on.
2968713	2973557	I thought, however, there was a really excellent article that was done by our buddy El Mullet.
2974147	2974888	InsidePulse.com
2999645	3001886	This is how they're in violation of the law, end of story.
3002286	3005747	Yeah, it doesn't matter how much you go, oh, blah, blah, blah, you're wrong.
3006668	3010329	Because if it were a good game, it wouldn't matter.
3010349	3019333	Well, this is what ticks people off, and this was in the original lawsuit documents, and of course it showed up in these original documents too, is that Konami in their lawsuit says, In the Groove is an inferior game.
3020033	3021614	And people go, ahhh!
3022434	3024635	You know, all the In the Groove fanboys, it goes, ahhh!
3026431	3030052	But it's got the minds, and it's got the increased steps, and it's got better music.
3030072	3033472	Okay, despite, you know, I don't really want to have that argument again.
3033973	3038073	Either you like In The Groove more than you like DDR Extreme or any of the previous mixes, or you don't.
3038213	3039374	You're one way or the other.
3039394	3040294	You think they're okay.
3040334	3040654	I don't know.
3041154	3053997	What I did find was interesting about it was the whole, they were showing their patents and stuff, and they were showing pictures of their concept for DDR and stuff, and the arrows were supposed to be scrolling downwards as the original concept.
3054017	3056197	Those were actually, those documents were in the first
3056693	3057334	DarkSakura.com
3076826	3078908	Well, A, in their minds it is.
3079068	3080509	I mean, it's a fact of the matter.
3080909	3085732	B, just the fact that I think a lot of it has to do with the setup of the game being inferior.
3085752	3090516	And this is why I talked about when the first lawsuit came up is that the hardware itself is the inferior part.
3090836	3094559	Because in the beginning, and I'm not talking about in the group too, and neither is the lawsuit.
3094659	3097120	In the beginning, in the group did not have its own cabinet.
3097240	3100683	It was built to be a stowaway game in other cabinets.
3100723	3102624	Therefore, the hardware is inferior.
3103245	3105926	Of course, now this lawsuit addresses the home versions, etc., etc.,
3107200	3108761	Um, so I don't know.
3110162	3114164	I guess they call it inferior because of the fact that it's basically... Inferior?
3115625	3117126	It's a mock-up of DDR.
3118087	3121389	It kind of started, if you think about it, Stepmania, it's built off of Stepmania.
3121409	3122609	You mean a mockery of DDR?
3123230	3127732	If you think about it, Stepmania was built to simulate DDR, right?
3128133	3131915	So a simulator is always going to be inferior to the original, right?
3132495	3132795	I don't know.
3132855	3134016	I guess that's one way you can look at it.
3134835	3135915	I don't want to get too far into this.
3136176	3141417	I like how the step charts are already online for In the Groove because they were easily ripped from the game.
3142078	3142658	Well, guess what?
3142718	3143558	It's In the Groove.
3143638	3145839	Wow, that was difficult.
3148320	3149040	I know, I know.
3149841	3153382	How do you like them apples, In the Groove, Roxor?
3154302	3155063	But you know what?
3155383	3163086	I don't think it hurts them at all because the same people that are into the step mania scene, I think, are a large part of the In the Groove fan base.
3163146	3164066	You're self-accepted.
3166172	3167172	That was before retards.
3170313	3172274	I don't understand why you won't even give the game a chance.
3172474	3173815	You just- That fucking sucks!
3173835	3177276	You've been anti-integrity- I can crap out better themes than that.
3177416	3179416	And honestly, I suck at making themes.
3179556	3181997	I mean, those are the plainest looking things I've ever seen.
3182517	3184658	It looks like something you would see in beta.
3185078	3185318	Okay?
3185378	3186419	It's like a beta game.
3188119	3189780	Yeah, he really wouldn't touch it if it was on a Mac.
3191597	3193478	I really wouldn't touch it if it was on a Mac.
3193758	3194659	That'd be just crap.
3195359	3196340	It kind of reminds me of the Mac.
3196380	3198901	It's nice and smoothed out and plain colors.
3200282	3200902	And pointless.
3201962	3203483	Because there's games out there that are better.
3204444	3206165	Just because it tries to look pretty.
3210807	3211767	But iTunes is cool.
3212308	3213008	Go iTunes.
3216570	3218671	Just, you know, run iTunes on your PC.
3220092	3220692	Intel PC.
3221420	3227564	or actually better than Intel PC, your AMD PC, and you're good to go.
3230186	3234969	Now, if you have a Mac, you might as well just get one of those Cyrix chips and throw it in your PC.
3235910	3237611	Let's step back a generation, shall we?
3238211	3241373	We've got some folks in the chat room that are going, let me at them, let me at them.
3241614	3245957	We will open up the Skype line in a little bit if you want to give your comments and feedback.
3246517	3249479	And those cards and letters, love letters addressed to Loki.
3250246	3252787	www.orangeloungeradio.com
3275217	3278099	I have the same problem with Apple that I also have with VW.
3278279	3279839	Let's make cute cars that suck.
3280720	3282721	Because people like cute, so they'll buy cute.
3282741	3284061	Have you driven one?
3284201	3287283	VW has the worst ratings as far as reliability.
3288103	3288944	I've driven in one.
3289804	3290585	That's not driving one.
3290605	3291245	Have you driven one?
3291465	3291565	No.
3292165	3293206	Okay, then you don't have room to talk.
3295767	3297328	I don't want to drive your crappy car, no.
3302272	3303513	I'm sorry, you do drive a Ford.
3304433	3305654	Six thousand repair daily.
3307375	3308636	No, my Ford is fine.
3308676	3310177	I've never had any problems with my Ford.
3310457	3311737	Wait, wait three years.
3312718	3313278	Wait three years.
3313298	3316480	I'm a former, I hate to say it, Loki, I'm a former Ford owner.
3316640	3316940	Wait.
3317300	3317581	Wait.
3318481	3318741	Fine.
3319061	3323063	The only Fords that last any time are the old ones, like my fiance's Mustang.
3324424	3325585	Oh yeah, that's a sexy car.
3327037	3328939	I will never buy another Ford.
3329099	3329860	1969 Mustang.
3330000	3331121	I will never touch a Mac.
3331361	3332822	All my cars from now on will be foreign.
3332882	3333443	And you know what?
3333483	3336445	My Lancer completely kicks all your cars' asses combined.
3336565	3337326	There will be some.
3337546	3337826	You know what?
3337866	3338907	You're a remixer.
3338967	3339908	You remix songs.
3339948	3345593	You have never been enticed by some of the Apple products like GarageBand or any of this stuff.
3345973	3346153	Ever.
3346674	3348696	Because I can get the same thing on a PC.
3349056	3349376	You know?
3349496	3349877	So what?
3349977	3351578	Ooh, it's got GarageBand.
3351618	3351718	Woo!
3353275	3354675	There's a PC equivalent for that.
3355056	3358676	Honestly, if you have a decent sound card, it's going to sound just the same.
3358836	3363277	The Mac does not have anything that a decent sound card can't be better than.
3363958	3365778	So, I don't really care.
3368059	3373580	Honestly, the thing that I hated about the original Macs and stuff was the fact that everything was hardwired.
3373620	3376020	And I still hate those stupid iMacs.
3376060	3377141	Those things are dumb.
3377741	3382462	You know, you can take the new G5s and put new hard drives in them and upgrade the RAM and everything.
3383117	3384698	Yeah, it's about time that they got with the game.
3386338	3389040	Just they don't tell you you can do this, but you can.
3390020	3390761	All right, kids.
3391121	3392401	Skype line is open.
3392601	3393642	Give us a call.
3393662	3396383	It's about time to get those Intel processors in there as well.
3397884	3399525	www.orangelunchradio.com.
3399545	3400085	Click on Skype.
3400105	3403146	If you want to talk about the lawsuit, you want to yell at Loki.
3403406	3406848	Although, please, kids, we can go back and forth on this all day long.
3407810	3411832	This is the classic interweb debate, is Mac versus PC.
3411912	3413993	I thought this debate ended like five years ago.
3414433	3416074	Leave it to Loki to bring it back up.
3416594	3418035	Why do we get to the FUs of the week?
3418055	3421317	Because I've got a whole other thing that I'm going to re-bring up again.
3422277	3422857	Goody, goody.
3424198	3424558	All right.
3425619	3426799	So the Skype line's open.
3426839	3429601	If you want to call in, www.orangeloungeradio.com.
3429641	3430901	Click on Interact With Us.
3431622	3432302	Oh, and look at that.
3432342	3433683	We're starting to get some phone calls.
3433743	3435744	I think this one's really been wanting to get through.
3436272	3437893	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3438713	3440213	Oh, I figured I'd come back.
3440313	3443815	I've got to jump in on this Mac versus PC debate here.
3443915	3444735	Can you guys hear us in studio?
3444755	3446156	I've got firsthand experience on this.
3446276	3447176	Okay, what's up?
3447236	3448236	I work on these things.
3448396	3449357	Introduce yourself, please.
3449637	3450517	Sorry, introduce yourself, sir.
3451737	3452458	I'm Reznor.
3452598	3452958	Hi, Reznor.
3452998	3454759	I've called in a couple of times.
3455219	3457419	You're the one that does the con on the East Coast, right?
3458560	3458840	Yeah.
3459000	3460020	Okay, I remember this guy.
3460160	3460421	All right.
3460801	3461561	So what's on your mind?
3462392	3465954	Well, I work on PCs and Mac day in and day out.
3466514	3468995	I used to really hate Macs.
3470316	3477939	And after working on them for about three months, Macs can kick PCs' asses all up and down the block.
3478600	3490085	If I have to just fix another PC user that brought it in because their stupid kid downloaded Kazaa and got Spyware all over it after I just cleaned it up, I'm going to scream.
3491076	3496141	I'll give you that because people assume that nobody uses Macs.
3496541	3499084	They haven't been as much of a target for the spyware and everything.
3499784	3512877	We've had so many PC people just come in and ditch... One guy traded in three PCs and bought two iMacs and a PowerBook on the spot because he was so sick and tired of his machine crashing and all sorts of crap.
3514279	3514499	Well...
3515168	3519331	Yep, those stupid users need a stupid computer, so it fits right in!
3519591	3521813	Cause, you know, goddamn retard's true!
3522774	3523094	Honestly!
3523134	3530099	I actually own both, um, so, uh, there's things, obviously the PC does gaming a lot better,
3530615	3531476	Thanks for watching!
3552242	3554204	You like their power tools.
3554284	3558387	They granny you to death, and Microsoft does the same thing, and I hate both.
3558407	3559148	You know what it is?
3559388	3561530	You like to build your own PCs, don't you?
3561810	3562590	Damn straight.
3562891	3566133	That's why you don't like Macs, because Macs don't allow you that flexibility.
3566173	3566814	Damn straight.
3566894	3568235	You like being able to buy a part here.
3568255	3569636	I'd like to differ with them on this one.
3569916	3575861	I've got about six PCs laying around that I just built from just parts laying around.
3575941	3577743	I'll build them day in, day out.
3578243	3578663	and many more.
3603153	3604415	I can't stand Dells either.
3604775	3606417	I can't agree with you on that one.
3606457	3608699	Buying an Apple is not like buying a Dell.
3609900	3617609	No, because the difference between a Dell and an Apple is Dell is sort of a put-together piece of crap, except for my laptop, which is pretty nice.
3618369	3620190	and Apple's actually work.
3620530	3626473	Dell is kind of like if you took a giant pile of shit and then you put a nice little case around it and you painted it black.
3626593	3630795	Whereas with an Apple, you actually put something useful in it and made it really small.
3630936	3637499	But to one thing say in defense of Dell's, which I really do need to say, their PCs are crap, but the laptops are pretty nice.
3638079	3647228	I'm not talking about the quality of service or anything like that because we all know Dell outsources their customer service and Apple's got a pretty decent customer service setup.
3647509	3654796	I'm not talking about that whole actual act of going in and purchasing, but I'm talking about that all-in-one feeling where you're buying a computer in a box.
3655636	3658679	Let's face it, the Mac Mini is totally a computer in a box.
3659060	3662143	Yes, you can mod those things, but the average user isn't going to be doing that.
3662563	3662783	Right?
3662803	3663444	Exactly.
3663524	3669311	Whereas to build a PC, you really have to think about, okay... The average user really has no need to modify a mini.
3669391	3670452	That's why they buy a mini.
3670512	3671353	Yeah, I understand that.
3671373	3672314	You plug it in and it works.
3672334	3675778	Except for freaks like us who buy the mini and then mod the hell out of it.
3675818	3677360	But I can... You're not a normal user.
3678131	3680472	I have an iBook and I run Terminal Live.
3680512	3684293	You run Linux.
3684493	3688974	The minute you install Linux on anything, you are already reached geek levels.
3689414	3691275	The Mac is Linux.
3691335	3696996	That's the cool thing about it.
3697657	3701138	I know the Mac is Linux-based, but I'm talking about the hardcore stuff.
3703079	3705900	because even though the Mac runs on Linux now, it is still a Mac.
3705960	3709822	It still feels like the old black and white Macs that we used to play Number Munchers on, okay?
3711402	3715624	I always played Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego, thank you very much.
3715664	3716844	I played that on my Commodore 64.
3717024	3718525	Dark Castle.
3719265	3720166	Actually, I'd like to correct you.
3720286	3721506	It would be black and green.
3722166	3723947	Oh, I'm eating this old school shit up.
3724087	3725047	Yeah, keep on going.
3727788	3728449	Oregon Trail, yo.
3730120	3731240	I just, Kix.
3731781	3733981	Dude, where is Oregon Trail on the PSP?
3734101	3734962	That's what we need.
3735162	3736622	No, Kix on an Apple IIe.
3737582	3739903	Oh my god, Kix, oh my god.
3739923	3741584	Was that the name of the Dark Castle?
3741664	3745405	It was only on a Mac, they didn't have it on PC, and you were going through, that game was sex.
3745725	3746525	That was a great game.
3747025	3749906	No, it was Kix and Lode Runner on an Apple IIe.
3750706	3752647	Lode Runner, oh my god.
3752707	3755568	I've lost countless bets trying to beat high scores in that game.
3756604	3759404	But see, all these games you all are talking about, they had on the Commodore 64.
3759444	3772327	Hey, I remember sitting there with my TI-94 computer with the cartridge crappy thing, trying to program little bouncing balls, blipping the little blippy music in BASIC.
3773287	3778508	I remember loading BASIC stuff onto my TI-86, or not TI-86.
3778528	3779288	TI-85 calculator?
3779488	3780188	No, not 85.
3780368	3782668	It's the actual old... The TI-99?
3783729	3785489	No, it's the old Texas Instrument computer.
3786518	3788860	No, not the calculator, actually the old computer.
3789300	3791502	Using a cassette tape, okay?
3791602	3792523	Hey, I had one of those.
3792943	3796666	You owned a TI-99 and you dare to bash on Macs now?
3797426	3802690	No, this was when I was five, and it wasn't a TI-99, it was my first computer.
3802750	3804371	It was a Texas instrument when I was five.
3805072	3807413	It's not, um, TI-99 was a calculator.
3807533	3813077	I'm angry at my grandmother for throwing this thing away, but I had one of the old Coleco computers with a tape deck.
3813558	3814098	Yeah, and Adam.
3814198	3814879	Oh, jeez.
3815819	3818401	and my grandma threw it away and I was like, NO!
3818541	3819362	That's my album!
3821983	3824365	Interesting side story about Texas Instruments.
3824465	3828708	I was the reason that they banned all the graphing calculators at my high school when I was going there.
3829229	3842198	I actually went out and sprung to get the data transfer cable and I downloaded tons of games for it like multiplayer Tetris and everything and I would bring them into school and then transfer them to other people's calculators and eventually
3842662	3846665	The entire 12th grade was doing nothing but playing games in class.
3846805	3855991	They hadn't figured that out yet when I was in high school because I had a nice graphing calculator and I was an AP Calculus and I was programming the complex formulas into my calculator so I could cheat on all the tests.
3856051	3856731	You know what, Rob?
3857251	3861374	I find it very funny that, you know, I think I graduated a year ahead of you, right?
3861454	3862395	Yeah.
3862475	3866057	I was playing pole position on those calculators in history class.
3866257	3867098	Yeah, pole position.
3867919	3871761	DarkTetsuya is so winner for this comment in our chatroom.
3871881	3873962	He wants an Oregon Trail MMO.
3873982	3874662	No.
3892711	3893272	Oh my god.
3893292	3894933	Dude, Oregon Trail MMO would rock.
3895053	3896474	Loki could die of dysentery.
3896614	3897235	Yay!
3898476	3900098	Oregon Trail Damacy.
3900378	3901859	No, honestly, that could work.
3902980	3904802	An Oregon Trail MMO could so work.
3904862	3905762	We need to get on that.
3907064	3908945	Let's start an online petition because those rock.
3909526	3912108	Yes, online petitions always do the trick.
3912408	3914470	So that's what we should do.
3914510	3916212	We're going to make an online petition.
3916232	3917213	We'll get it slash dotted.
3919963	3922887	Who the crap is going to play an Oregon Trail MMO?
3923007	3924409	Me, motherfucker, me!
3925851	3931798	You get to Oregon and then you have to build a castle and then you can make a blacksmith and put shoes on horses.
3932119	3932940	That's great fun.
3934283	3935364	Well, then you go back.
3935784	3936865	I mean, here's the thing.
3942469	3948432	When we talk about the Oregon Trail, we always talked about the people who are going out west to seek a better life.
3948813	3953796	We never talked about those people that got there and then realized, this place sucks.
3953816	3954476	Yes, wagons east.
3957598	3966405	Any game where you can have four people die because your wagon flooded in a river that's two inches deep is retarded.
3968787	3972250	I have major issues against Oregon Trail.
3972290	3975213	You need to make something more like Kingdom of Loathing.
3975373	3978055	OMG, looking for party, need to cross river.
3980057	3980517	Need cock.
3981135	3984156	Fear and Loathing in Oregon, yeah.
3984376	3985136	Morphine, please.
3985456	3988277	Looking for Black Mage who can cast Float on my fight.
3989098	3991118	Maybe you'd see MRPH and PLZ.
3993159	3998781	Or my favorite is when I'd go hunting and I'd just kill everything and just have way too much meat.
4000179	4003102	You killed 40,000 pounds of meat, but you can only carry 100.
4003142	4005484	That used to happen to me all the time.
4005504	4008847	Yeah, PETA would be all over your ass in that MMO.
4009007	4010988	I was killing buffalo, like every buffalo in sight.
4011008	4011749	He smells like death.
4011769	4017294	Yeah, we're going to give him a... I love the smell of decay in the morning.
4018835	4022938	And then somebody's going to have a speed hack, and people are like, hey, you stole my bear kill.
4023058	4026641	Oh my god, someone unlocked the sex hack in Oregon Trail.
4028496	4031077	And all it does is a bunch of women showing their ankles.
4031538	4034839	Okay, we just unlocked this feature in Oregon Trail.
4034879	4040802	When we stop at the next fort, you can either shop for wagon parts or you can stop in for hot coffee.
4040922	4044224	And then the new add-on where you steal the Indians' land.
4046245	4049247	I'd like to know what the expansions are going to be, yo.
4049267	4050687	The Alaskan Trail!
4052228	4053289	The Canadian Trail.
4054316	4056059	Oh yeah, you have to dodge Mounties.
4056099	4058842	The Pacific Trail where they have to cross the ocean.
4058862	4059623	The Mexican Trail.
4059663	4064169	I'm sorry, now I'm thinking of like a Ren and Simpy with the Royal Canadian Kilted Yaksman.
4069721	4072102	Okay, was there ever a sequel to the Oregon Trail?
4072122	4072982	Like a different trail?
4073382	4074822	It was called Everybody's Dead!
4074842	4077623	No, it was a remake of the original thing and it sucked.
4078083	4078943	It sucked, really.
4078963	4080984	They needed a sequel to the Oregon Trail.
4081024	4082764	Every other... Number Munchers got a sequel.
4082784	4083944	They got Word Munchers.
4084424	4085045	What else was there?
4085065	4086845	What other classic... There's only one Oregon.
4086865	4090986	How can you make a sequel of a historical... How can you make another Oregon?
4092006	4093608	You could- Oregon Trail 2.
4096030	4099372	Oregon Trail 2 is back and it's pissed.
4100794	4101114	We made it!
4101134	4103616	We're taking the Oregon Trail through the ghetto now.
4103636	4106418	We don't have to worry about drive-bys and crack whores.
4107319	4111963	Are you John Connor?
4112003	4113845	If it's gonna go through the ghetto it would have to be Oakland Trail.
4114125	4117688	There has to be another trail somewhere in the world that they could do a game off of.
4118068	4119249	The Iraqi Trail!
4119269	4119910	There you go!
4122726	4125028	You've got to make it down the sand road.
4125128	4126449	Trail of a thousand tears.
4126609	4127750	We can do it.
4127770	4128971	Puerto Rican trail.
4130171	4131212	Puerto Rican.
4131252	4132693	Oh my god.
4134835	4138898	Yes, this gets my vote as the most politically incorrect episode ever.
4138938	4139518	That's alright.
4139578	4140519	It's a landmark number.
4140539	4141039	We're okay.
4141740	4142540	What number is it?
4142560	4143701	I've been like at a circuit.
4143881	4144702	It's 150 tonight.
4144942	4145723	It's divisible by 50.
4146103	4147524	Yes, it's divisible by 50.
4148424	4148805	And two.
4148845	4150446	Holy crap, I need another beer on that.
4150751	4152171	Alright, yeah, me too, I think so.
4152251	4154732	Alright, Reznor, any other closing thoughts?
4154752	4157373	I gotta get some other calls, but we do enjoy having you on the show.
4157393	4159394	You bring out the old school in us, I appreciate it.
4159874	4161734	Hey, you gotta keep in touch with your roots.
4162354	4165635	Hell yes we do, so that's all I use my PSP for, Kid Icarus.
4166636	4166956	Woot.
4167336	4168236	Alright, I'll let you go.
4168336	4169917	Have a good one, my friend, and take care.
4169937	4170617	Thanks for the call.
4171557	4171797	Later.
4173058	4173898	That was a fun call.
4174598	4176299	Turtle, the MMO.
4176419	4177439	Let's take another call.
4178081	4182724	Oregon Trail 2, Arcade Edition Anyway, hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
4182744	4190109	You're on Oregon Trail Radio Sephiroth1215 and SSJ100Matt and many other people Many other people?
4190130	4192531	Are you having like an Orange Lounge listening party or something?
4193792	4206381	Yeah It's the Orange Lounge orgy, that's awesome We have hit a new level of tastelessness, congratulations to us People have moved from having Buffy parties to having Orange Lounge parties That makes me feel kind of cool
4206963	4208064	Anyway, what's on your mind, guys?
4210085	4210545	Not much.
4213666	4217048	There's someone that wants to talk about the Mac and PC thing.
4217408	4217988	Goody, goody.
4218268	4218709	Put him on.
4219649	4220129	All right.
4220289	4220570	All right.
4222210	4222450	Okay.
4222470	4223831	Who is this?
4223911	4224572	Introduce yourself.
4225672	4226612	I'm Chris DeCruz.
4227293	4227673	Hello.
4228153	4228513	How are you?
4229374	4231275	Quite frankly, I don't care if you know my real name.
4231335	4231595	All right.
4231655	4232035	That's fine.
4233096	4233456	Anyway...
4234369	4240235	About the Mac and Intel thing, they're saying how you can run virtual PC on a Mac and play any of the PC games.
4241115	4244318	Emulators cause massive slowdown, and it's not feasible at all.
4245099	4246801	I know people who've done it.
4246901	4250985	In the chat room it was kind of brought up, we kind of addressed this during the break, that it's more...
4251465	4254047	If you want to play the DOS-based games, you'd be okay.
4254087	4255208	Yes, the DOS-based games.
4255488	4258810	But say, for example, Battlefield 2 is not going to be running.
4258870	4259650	No, but you know what?
4259690	4262472	If you want to play Battlefield 2, you really should... Who wants to play that crap?
4263313	4265935	Well, look, if you want to play Battlefield 2, you should own a PC anyway.
4265975	4269297	I'm talking about Ragnarok and PSO, which I play on my laptop.
4270718	4274140	Well, PSO and Ragnarok... Oh, Ragnarok is what?
4274660	4275401	Sprite-based?
4275481	4275761	Yeah.
4275781	4278563	And PSO is six years old?
4278583	4278663	Yeah.
4279637	4281739	Well, the PC version's new, but you're right.
4281759	4283620	I don't give a shit about Final Fantasy XI.
4283660	4284601	I think that game is ass.
4284621	4286362	Well, Final Fantasy XI is horrible.
4287323	4288884	Which is why I quit it twice.
4290685	4301933	Look, my response to the fact that the PC emulators on a Mac will play DOS-based games is I said, well, then it will play ZZT, and that's all you need.
4302754	4302974	Honestly.
4302994	4304635	My DS will play DOS-based games.
4304655	4305576	I don't understand your point.
4307486	4308806	I want ZZT on the PSP.
4308826	4314788	Go buy a PassMe and blank ROM cartridges and just install everything on there.
4318089	4318529	All right.
4318869	4321289	Anything else you want to share on the whole Mac versus PC thing?
4321309	4324350	I think they're demanding me to get off this before you kick everyone else off.
4324470	4325730	All right.
4325950	4326911	Thanks for your input.
4329771	4332592	We're getting passed around like a bong at this party.
4332992	4333392	What's up?
4337560	4345727	First of all, I'd like to ask, you're going to be on the East Coast in a few weeks, and are you going to be anywhere else but the place in New Jersey?
4347508	4350171	Am I making any more live appearances, so to speak?
4350691	4352232	No, nobody's really asked.
4353573	4361160	I'm actually going out there for work, so my Monday through Fridays are kind of booked with the real world work stuff, but on the weekend I'm open to suggestions.
4361360	4363822	If you have something, just email me and I'll see what I can do.
4365018	4366199	Um, alright then, we'll see.
4366379	4368761	But the New Jersey thing right now is definite.
4368981	4374684	I want to do the New Jersey tournament, because I haven't been to a DDR tournament in like years, so I think it would be funny to go to one on the East Coast for the first time, so.
4375645	4377246	Make sure you kick those plugs, it kind of smells.
4377546	4377866	Stop it.
4378307	4378887	It does!
4378967	4380868	I was in Philadelphia, it smelled like New Jersey!
4382089	4382389	Anyway.
4383510	4385812	Well, I've been there, it wasn't all that great, but it was alright.
4386512	4387112	What's on your mind?
4387152	4389394	Didn't you go to some con recently you wanted to share with us, and...
4390373	4391094	Go to New York?
4391114	4391654	Basically, anything...
4407990	4410392	Fantasy, Sci-Fi, Nerd, stuff.
4411092	4412073	So it's kind of like a Comic Con.
4412093	4413954	Yeah, there's a big furry thing, if you want to know that.
4414735	4415996	Oh, it's a furry convention.
4416076	4416596	How lovely.
4416756	4417897	No, no, no.
4418758	4419899	That was just a large part of it.
4420259	4420899	Oh, well, okay.
4421400	4426023	So it's kind of like at an anime con out here, hentai is always a big part of it, no matter what.
4426063	4426904	You can't escape it.
4427584	4428865	No, hentai was big there, too.
4430346	4431207	So, yeah, there was...
4432714	4437096	There's a big gaming room for anything gaming, huge screens, whatever.
4437136	4439958	Did you get to play any new import game type things for the first time?
4441558	4442359	No, I didn't get to.
4444280	4450383	There was good stuff, but... I've been to Connecticut, it's not that awful.
4450503	4451804	It's better than Delaware.
4452844	4454585	It's better than Delaware, come on!
4455646	4456886	There's not much to do in Connecticut.
4457326	4458407	There's not much to do in Delaware.
4458837	4459357	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4484721	4486403	I'm going to put SJ100 Matt on.
4486663	4487143	Sounds good.
4488725	4489646	Puff, puff, pass.
4489826	4490106	Hi.
4490426	4490686	Yep.
4491147	4493088	Hey, what's up?
4493148	4493369	Good.
4493389	4500675	Yeah, I'm going to elaborate a little bit more since Sephiroth is playing Smash Brothers, so... What?
4500735	4502936	He's playing video games while he's trying to talk to us?
4503577	4505238	Yes, we got several people here.
4505258	4507740	He's trying to play video games and losing badly.
4507920	4508221	All right.
4509081	4511543	Okay, anyways... I can owe it all of you at Smash Brothers.
4511623	4512064	Ha, ha, ha.
4513263	4515085	They might take you up on that, be careful.
4515325	4516285	They'll have to come to California.
4516406	4517326	Anyway, I'm sorry.
4518747	4521069	When the revolution comes out, we'll all be playing online.
4521209	4522130	Aha, there you have it.
4522770	4526053	And I will still own you all, because I am the master of Kirby.
4527494	4528014	Alright, sorry.
4528214	4529135	What's on your mind, SSJ?
4530236	4537902	Well, the... Kineticon was really good in the fact that it had a lot of workshops, a lot of...
4538933	4539393	DarkSakura
4554741	4560723	Gaming, Magic Cards, and other card game matches going on.
4561623	4564024	Dude, Magic Cards are still around?
4564384	4564604	Yeah.
4565044	4567785	My co-worker participates in tournaments.
4567845	4570286	Oh my god, that was like ten years ago I was in a Magic Card.
4570306	4575207	I'm not knocking the Magic Cards thing, but I'm just saying, wow, I can't believe it has this longevity going on with it.
4575307	4576027	This is crazy.
4576047	4576488	Anyway, sorry.
4578428	4580909	But, yeah, the gaming room, they had
4582341	4586552	Smash Brothers Tournament going on, and they had a Halo 2 tournament going on.
4587174	4588317	How was the Smash Brothers Tournament?
4588337	4588919	I liked that game.
4589621	4590323	Well, actually, we...
4591656	4602040	Well, actually, we kind of entered it, but we didn't go to it, because it was like a couple-hour preliminary rounds and all that, so we didn't have time for that.
4602181	4603121	Gotcha.
4603201	4610084	But we donated a GameCube for a short time, which actually gave us tickets to the next Kineticon for free.
4610164	4610564	Oh, there you go.
4610584	4611725	How often do they have Kineticon?
4611745	4612505	Just once a year, or...?
4613613	4614073	Once a year.
4614133	4618234	This was the first time that they had it in the big Hartford Convention Center.
4618434	4618954	Oh, right on.
4619674	4620614	For Connecticut, that's big.
4620894	4621414	That's really big.
4623055	4623515	Well, yeah, well.
4626215	4632516	I'm pasting a link to the pictures on the chat room.
4633157	4633517	Right on.
4633557	4637117	I hope our listeners want to check that out, especially if they're on the East Coast and missed it.
4637177	4639878	Then they can see everything they missed, and they'll go next year.
4639898	4640858	Yeah.
4641414	4646277	and they had a Beatmania tournament, a poppin' music tournament.
4646437	4648098	What style were they doing the Beatmania thing on?
4650480	4652521	I heard someone mention 8, but I'm not positive.
4652601	4652901	Okay.
4655323	4665429	Poppin' music, I think they had some sort of tournament to win like a Naruto customized poppin' music pad or something, which looked interesting.
4667170	4669792	And then, of course, the dealer room, which was interesting.
4670786	4672627	and plenty of cosplays.
4673507	4675748	Any scary cosplays?
4677549	4678329	What do you mean scary?
4678869	4679829	He's talking about boobies.
4680250	4683151	I'm talking about, like, super fat Sailor Moon.
4684671	4687092	No, I'm talking about the guys who dress up like... Sailor Menchi.
4687252	4692854	I'm talking about fat men who dress up like my... Sailor Menchi.
4693315	4699777	There were a couple of really scary ones, you know, the chubby girls who thought they could be Kagome from Inuyasha.
4701383	4705144	from the WNFL Ares.
4705525	4708405	Yeah, we saw a WNFL Ares.
4709626	4710766	Like Final Fantasy 7?
4710846	4716728	Yeah, well, you know, she looked like she could play in the NFL.
4717328	4718069	Oh, okay, I get it.
4718089	4719209	Quite scary.
4719969	4726531	There was one girl who wore a Darkstalkers costume.
4727732	4728452	Very revealing.
4728672	4729012	I see.
4731768	4732948	How about any good cosplay?
4732968	4733589	Were there good ones?
4734870	4735470	There were several.
4735510	4739132	I actually posted up a lot of the good ones in the chat room.
4741033	4742634	Check out the pictures there.
4743875	4749058	Did somebody say Goatse cosplay?
4749098	4749918	That's disgusting.
4750478	4754280	How would one cosplay that?
4754421	4755441	Very slowly.
4755801	4756822	It would be real pain in the ass.
4758920	4762685	Out of the 12 people in this small room, there's about 11 of them who are wise asses.
4763966	4766129	There's 12 people over there?
4766930	4767631	In a tiny room, yeah.
4767671	4770054	Dude, that's more people than listen to our show regularly.
4770134	4771375	And everyone's fully clothed.
4771916	4772216	Alright.
4773558	4773879	Alright.
4774299	4774900	Oh, I might add...
4775907	4778929	are actually voting for you on that whole thing that you have.
4779009	4780310	Oh, the Podcast Awards thing?
4780750	4780930	Yes.
4781130	4781931	Thank you kindly.
4782191	4783492	I didn't even remember to mention this.
4783512	4787314	We got nominated Best Gaming Podcast over on PodcastAwards.com.
4787374	4789275	Go vote for us, because we like attention.
4790716	4794318	Well, actually, I have a quick little story that happened at Kineticon.
4794438	4794818	All right.
4796199	4799201	My buddy Sephiroth was playing, what song was it?
4800302	4800662	At least.
4801275	4802936	Could this kid even play 2DX?
4802996	4811739	Because I've had the kids at Roosevelt Golf Land that are like 12 years old try to make fun of me.
4829554	4833838	And then it's like, you know, well, dude, if you're so good at DDR, you want to play a match against me?
4833878	4836260	I'll pick the song, you know, Healing Vision Angelic Mix or something.
4836460	4838362	I hinted that to him.
4838382	4847530	It's like, well, I've seen him play a couple times, but, you know, he plays on 1.5 and 2X, and if you don't do that, you're considered a noob.
4848631	4849072	Huh.
4850153	4851554	But, no, you know what?
4852895	4855297	I didn't want to, like, get into an argument with him.
4855337	4856018	I didn't want to, like,
4856676	4859218	Be mean to him because he's like a 16-year-old kid.
4859258	4866464	I think with his overweightness, I'm sure life has already dealt a poor hand to him.
4867545	4871788	Yeah, you sometimes wonder what happens to children to make them turn out so strange.
4872689	4878373	Yeah, but he was very rude, so I had to step in and save my friend over here.
4878533	4881836	Other than that, Kineticon was very good.
4881896	4881996	It's
4882990	4884351	I have to tell you one thing.
4884371	4885251	Oh, he has one thing to say.
4885832	4888733	I got to meet Tiffany Grant, who is also the voice of Asuka.
4890014	4890494	Right on.
4891294	4896037	And also, we met Piano Squall, if you know who that is.
4896677	4897197	No idea.
4899418	4902680	I have to be honest, I don't follow the anime thing that closely.
4902820	4907783	Like, I like some of it, but... There's one thing that you're going to be jealous of, and we got to meet Freeze Pop.
4908503	4909543	That's awesome.
4910224	4910904	I am jealous.
4911144	4912545	I am jealous.
4913263	4914743	I got to meet Togo at E3.
4914763	4915544	That was kind of cool.
4916724	4919025	Do I get a cookie for that?
4919425	4919705	All right.
4919865	4921945	We're going to let you go so you guys can get back to your party.
4922105	4922946	We get back to our show.
4924186	4924706	That's all right.
4926147	4927747	For 12 people, I can make the time.
4928067	4930548	That's twice our normal listenership.
4930588	4930988	That's huge.
4931228	4931508	All right.
4933148	4933849	Have a good time, kids.
4935889	4936689	Bye.
4939750	4940450	Oh, my gosh.
4940751	4941931	Orange Lounge listening parties.
4941951	4942471	Who would have thought?
4943601	4944902	Alright, we're going to go to a break, kids.
4944922	4948003	When we come back from this break, we're going to do the Cage Match, some other news going on.
4948323	4951384	We're doing Happy Sky Music tonight, going to continue on with that theme.
4951684	4955746	We're going to have in this break, we're going to have a song, a brand new Akira Yamaoka song is going to start it off.
4955766	4961128	We're going to have a song that's actually a Papa Music crossover in this break as well, and a song named after a dog.
4961488	4962368	We'll all be in this break.
4962748	4967250	So we'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio and the Cage Match and the FUs of the week.
4967970	4971732	Maybe some Ask Orange Lounge if we have time, and if we get around to it, some actual DDR news.
4971832	4972252	We'll be back.
4975097	4976179	Thank you for watching!
5028825	5029596	Thanks for watching!
5077370	5078190	Thanks for watching!
5162971	5163934	Thanks for watching!
5214958	5216199	Thanks for watching!
5288048	5289350	Thank you for watching
5451914	5459641	For up to a minute of Ammanian gaming news, discussion forums, and for access to the chat room, visit our website at orangeloungeradio.com Happy Sky
5476124	5481870	Zephyr, a very epic song in there, and then Y&Co, folks behind Monkey Dance, Daisuki, their new song, Poodle!
5482631	5482891	Cute.
5485054	5488335	Oh, I see you over there, DarkSakura, reading the new Harry Potter.
5488655	5490175	I did the same thing last time.
5490255	5495456	I do remember when that... God, this show's been on a long time, because I remember when the last book came out.
5495816	5499476	I want to say when Goblet of Fire came out, you were on here, too, but I think that might have been before.
5499576	5500957	Actually, yeah, I was.
5501937	5502357	Were you?
5502497	5502997	Oh, my gosh.
5503437	5511979	So, I've got to ask you about this, because this was something that was kind of pissing me off, but it seems like there's kids on the Internet that are loving spoiling this new book.
5512839	5513999	What do you think about this whole thing?
5514739	5515359	The spoiler.
5515479	5517520	So what?
5517560	5519121	You have the option of reading it or not?
5519722	5526385	No, but there's people that have gone on LiveJournal and they'll post it in their journal, not behind a cut, in really big font, the big spoiler, so that all their friends can read it.
5526405	5527125	Nobody's done that on mine.
5527605	5530847	Well, because they know you'll defriend their ass, but I've seen it on mine.
5531286	5531926	I wouldn't do that.
5531966	5532386	That's petty.
5533227	5535868	But to post a spoiler like that is petty, isn't it?
5536948	5538549	No, it's stupid.
5538589	5545331	It's rude, but it's not something that's worth all of a sudden not being somebody's friend over.
5545991	5550193	I think it would really depend on how close you were with somebody in the first place, though.
5550213	5553574	If it's just somebody you just kind of knew on the internet, they added you because they thought their LJ was cool.
5553614	5555335	But if it was somebody I knew in real life...
5555720	5558182	I wouldn't do it, but I don't know.
5558342	5561464	Nobody has posted any big-fonted spoilers on my live journal.
5561484	5562325	Yeah, I just think...
5563752	5564952	You know, let people have their thing.
5564972	5567313	I think it has to do with the general character of the people I've been friending.
5567713	5571675	Well, that's good, but I mean, I think, I'm just kind of like, you know what, let people have their thing.
5571975	5591321	You might be making fun of the Harry Potter thing, but let's face it, you listen to a DDR radio show, I'm not talking about you guys specifically, I don't think anybody that listens to this show is in on this, but you know, the people that are posting spoilers, it's like, you know what, and then they go, oh, I'm spoiling it because Harry Potter fanboys are stupid.
5591841	5594262	And I'm just like, you know what, you probably got your stupid thing too.
5594602	5596163	How would you like me to go take a dump on that?
5598583	5601364	I already know what's going to happen, so I don't care.
5602945	5604245	For me, it's how they get there.
5607086	5611908	Anyway, I decided I would have a Guinness in celebration of our 150th episode.
5611928	5614489	I'm having a celebratory drink since I don't have to drive tonight.
5614829	5615889	I'm having an upset stomach.
5616830	5618010	I'm supposed to plug something.
5618030	5621131	They actually made a chat room called Channel Oregon Trail.
5624167	5630748	to discuss the latest news and events behind everybody's favorite upcoming MMO, The Oregon Trail Strikes Back.
5632088	5633009	So join that channel.
5633269	5633829	It's a good time.
5636049	5636389	Alright.
5637269	5637549	Anyway.
5638789	5639170	Let's see.
5639250	5643970	Moving on with other news going on throughout the gaming world and the Bomani world.
5644330	5653492	DDR with Mario had their site open up and it actually happened a little while ago but it kind of happened under the radar because I think a lot of people might have given up on DDR with Mario once they heard that
5653991	5654912	Thanks for watching!
5671502	5672823	Like, heavy or whatever it was.
5672843	5677745	I don't think it was the hardest, hardest difficulty, because not all songs had that, but it was like one below it.
5678026	5680067	And it was about the equivalent of Five Footer, and I triple-a'd it.
5680367	5683909	And I'm not the type of person that sits there and triple-a's all these songs on DDR.
5683929	5687971	I mean, I've done some, but I'm by no means like this excellent DDR player.
5688631	5691554	So, DDR with Mario is kind of simple.
5693776	5699781	But the Japanese site opened up for DDR with Mario because I believe the game actually might have come out in Japan.
5700022	5701903	I have to be honest, I haven't really been following this.
5703024	5704806	Oh, it did just a few days ago.
5704866	5707448	July 14th was the release date in Japan.
5707648	5708950	So, there you have it.
5709070	5711612	And you can look at the website and look at all the features and
5712634	5713234	All that stuff.
5713334	5716435	Although it's all in Japanese, so unless you can read Japanese, you're not going to be able to read it.
5717215	5719476	Unless you run it through a translator or something.
5722977	5724578	Anyway, so I guess that's some big Bumani news.
5725738	5731680	I think it's interesting because there's still a lot of speculation going on with the new DDRs coming out, Extreme 2 and Ultramix 3.
5732340	5737582	Just kind of been keeping a pulse on what's going on on the DDR-freak threads, which is where the majority of the discussion's been occurring.
5738002	5742343	I think a lot of people were expecting Extreme 2 to make a debut at Comic-Con
5743066	5744107	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5755683	5756343	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5783539	5784119	Still the date.
5784820	5787923	I think the only one that got pushed back was Karaoke Revolution Party.
5788123	5792546	It got pushed back one week later, so it's not coming out the same day as Ultramix 3.
5792606	5794648	It's coming out the week after that.
5794828	5797410	I heard some things were going on with Karaoke Revolution Party, but I can't talk about them.
5798671	5801033	You can tell me, because I pretty much know everything that's going on.
5801053	5801714	I can't.
5801754	5802695	Why can't you tell me?
5803135	5804516	Let's have this discussion off air, please.
5805377	5806418	All right.
5807759	5808580	But it's going to rock.
5808600	5809520	You all should pick that up.
5811624	5825730	And then there's Ultramix 3, which I think is interesting because one of the very most recent posts in the Ultramix 3 thread was by somebody who's actually in our chat room right now, Renee, although I always want to say Rini, because there's so many E's.
5826010	5827150	I'm going to get punched for saying that.
5827431	5831732	But it actually referenced our own site and the lovely DarkSakura, her photo gallery.
5831792	5834914	Remember how you took just a shitload of pictures of E3 of everything?
5835034	5835334	Yeah.
5835454	5837935	Well, somebody finally decided to look at the pictures and
5838015	5838796	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5859935	5868217	But the things that were shown here, Emi being in a schoolgirl outfit, I didn't realize people didn't know that before, but yes, Emi was in a schoolgirl outfit in the E3 demo, and it was cute.
5868317	5868737	I liked it.
5869118	5870358	Just like the graduation video.
5873599	5876720	I liked slut Emi better, though, for Ultramix 2.
5876900	5878280	Slut Emi was a piece of shit.
5880881	5882781	I liked slut Emi, too, actually.
5882901	5884562	It was a lot of fan service, though.
5886842	5889103	If you guys got slut Emi, I'd get hands-less rage.
5892054	5892354	Anyway.
5894556	5896197	No, no, it's not three-titted Emmy.
5896337	5897838	It's only, you know, slut Emmy.
5897878	5900099	So you'd have to get... And I'd get man-poor rage.
5900360	5904102	Yeah, you'd have to get, like, rage in tight shorts or something.
5906183	5912347	The result screen is a, and I quote, bubbly bubble bubbly bub in the background, and not fancy, just plain and simple.
5912408	5913068	However, it shows...
5913442	5914603	How many calories you've burned.
5914643	5916925	Doesn't look like workout mode because the numerical score is shown.
5917345	5919267	I didn't even notice that when I was playing.
5919547	5924031	And I've been saying for like two years now that they just need to integrate workout mode into the normal DDR.
5924331	5926313	So if that actually happened, that makes me very happy.
5926453	5929956	I didn't even notice that when I was playing, but I was just so jazzed to be playing Ultramix 3.
5930156	5932198	I wasn't looking for all the little things when I was playing it.
5933479	5938383	But that's very cool because I don't think workout mode should be separate because you can't unlock things when you play in workout mode.
5938423	5939524	At least I don't think you can.
5940861	5951828	But from what I remember about Ultramix 3 and the interface, basically, take Ultramix 2 and replace whatever blue futuristic background thing they had with the bubbles, and that was Ultramix 3's interface.
5953269	5954029	The main part of it.
5954910	5960113	So if you want to see that, that's over on DDR Freak.
5960774	5962595	And I will get my pictures up at some point.
5962675	5965797	I don't think my pictures show anything new about the game, but I guess you never know.
5966417	5968779	But you do have a picture of me with Mario.
5968799	5968879	Yeah.
5969528	5971449	I do have a picture of you with Mario, and it rocks.
5971469	5973129	I have a picture of me with Mario, and one with Link.
5973429	5977270	I took some pictures of the Beatmania demo, too, but the Beatmania demo really didn't have anything in it.
5977350	5981492	I mean, the Beatmania demo was just Night Style plus Oh My God's five key songs in it.
5981732	5982172	Woo!
5983092	5989854	And it was stuck on Training... What the hell is the one-star mode called?
5989874	5990494	I can't even remember.
5991015	5991695	Yeah, Beginner Mode.
5992135	5994636	Seven Key Mode was stuck on Beginner Mode, which I thought was kind of funny.
5995476	5998637	But it's not going to be that way in the regular release, so don't worry, guys.
6002481	6004902	Any day now we should start finding out new songs for these games.
6004922	6009305	I'm surprised no new artists have leaked out what songs are going to be in it or anything like that.
6009546	6010586	Not yet.
6010987	6012928	We should start finding out some songs pretty soon.
6012968	6015750	I would hope that they're going to put out a finalized release pretty soon.
6016110	6022955	Well, before that, don't you think, when the press gets a hold of these games, they're going to start posting pictures on their website?
6023035	6024936	Has GamePro reviewed it again yet?
6025577	6027138	Not yet, but you know it'll happen.
6028699	6033580	I swear, does Konami not learn with GamePro?
6034241	6041362	I would seriously try to sue them for, you know... Well, no, because it created buzz for their games.
6041462	6042923	I think it had a positive effect.
6043803	6046064	It created buzz on the games and got people talking.
6046144	6047264	Oh my god, here's the song list.
6047304	6047944	Oh my god, oh my god.
6048324	6050145	So, you know, I don't think it was a bad thing.
6050205	6051085	I wouldn't sue them over it.
6051425	6052605	It got people talking about the game.
6052665	6053386	Free advertising.
6054166	6057047	Where I'd make them review the Ninja Turtles game over and over and over again.
6057847	6058287	Or Frogger.
6062715	6065278	Alright kids, I think it's time to get into tonight's cage match.
6065319	6078196	If you want to be a part of the cage match, you've got to join our chat room over at www.orangeloungeradio.com Alright, and the way the cage match works...
6079718	6082719	We're going to play three songs for you guys, last week's winner.
6082739	6085999	A clip of it, anyway, because it won last week, so you've already heard the song.
6086359	6089240	We're going to play that, and then we're going to play two new songs for you guys.
6089560	6101542	You guys vote on your favorite, and the winner goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's Bomani Music & More program, which plays 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, on the station when we are not live.
6101562	6102783	Alright, here it is.
6103323	6104803	Last week in the cage match.
6105676	6106817	Blur with Girls and Boys
6136605	6137834	Thanks for watching!
6158104	6166927	My battery's been cut Can't look for someone to pray for My thing is nothing is wasted Only repurchase You cannot be blessed
6177791	6179714	Thanks for watching!
6230301	6242128	Girls who are boys, who like boys To be girls who did boys like they girls Who did girls like they boys Always should be someone you really like
6255509	6257790	Thanks for watching!
6287099	6289340	Thanks for watching!
6317967	6318447	Woopies!
6319028	6319668	Alright, anyway.
6321309	6325491	We're gonna get into song number two of tonight's Cage Match, so that was song number one, Blur with Girls and Boys.
6325531	6326432	Here's song number two.
6326912	6343882	Song number two tonight is my pick, and I decided to pick, um, I kinda like the new, um, Utada album, so, um, I picked a song that's actually a remix, because I like this remix, because it's different than the song on the album, and, um, I think it's a little bit better.
6344673	6348277	And I was also just desperate to find something at the last minute, so I just went ahead and picked this one.
6348658	6350601	So here it is, song number two of tonight's cage match.
6350661	6354947	It's Utada with Exodus 04, the Double J Radio Mix.
6457498	6458761	Thank you for watching!
6587441	6592885	Song number two in tonight's cage match, that was Utada with Exodus 04.
6593465	6594446	It smells like beer in here.
6595327	6596047	I wonder why.
6596388	6600591	Let's see if that song should go on in Exodus or if it should stay here forever.
6601231	6601711	DarkSakura.
6603212	6607656	Kind of generic and sounds like all the rest of her stuff, so it gets a six.
6608536	6608857	Loki.
6609277	6616302	I like the instrumental, but the vocals just sounded like... I guess it just sounds like her, so... It was okay, it was just...
6618532	6622236	I agree on that it's a little repetitive, but it's kind of a dance mix.
6622696	6626541	But I think it improves on the original, because I don't like the original.
6626561	6628023	It's like a low-energy dance mix.
6628083	6631246	Yeah, it's kind of a closing time.
6631907	6636773	I'm standing there drunk, and I'm kind of bobbing my head to the music.
6637631	6638912	All right, so I give it like an eight.
6639252	6641735	All right, song number three, Loki's pick.
6641755	6643016	What did you pick for us tonight, Loki?
6643116	6645258	Well, if you want retro, here's retro right here.
6645638	6646038	Sort of.
6646158	6647019	It's retro redone.
6647079	6649521	It's Stayin' Alive.
6649781	6651063	Like the Bee Gees?
6651343	6654165	Like the Bee Gees, but done by Ozzy Osbourne.
6656827	6657468	Okay.
6657788	6658169	It's good.
6659470	6659650	What?
6660225	6660526	Wait.
6660746	6661347	Staying Alive.
6661407	6662830	Oh, I have this.
6663551	6664353	Okay, here we go.
6664373	6665314	I already know what I'm reading it.
6665615	6666236	Alright, here we go.
6666316	6669081	Song number three, Staying Alive by Ozzy Osbourne.
6669121	6669362	Enjoy.
6686087	6686728	Oh yeah!
6686788	6691832	Well, you can't deal with the way I use my work I'm a woman's man, sometimes it's all easy-going
6713163	6714504	Thank you for watching!
6756002	6757103	Thank you for watching!
6774332	6779879	Day in the Life, Day in the Life, Day in the Life, Day in the Life, Day in the Life
6800687	6816419	It's alright, it's okay, we may go the other way We can try to understand, but we don't have nothing to say It's alright, it's okay, let's see another day We can try to understand, but we don't have nothing to say Ha ha ha ha ha
6917304	6918786	Thank you for watching!
6955019	6958462	now my ass smells like beer because I sat in the wet beer part of the chair
6959421	6961823	Song number three, Ozzy Osbourne, Stayin' Alive.
6963424	6963945	What do you think?
6964045	6966106	Stayin' Alive or should we pull the plug on that song?
6966146	6966807	DarkSakura.
6966867	6968468	Stayin' Alive was a crap movie.
6971030	6976594	I've had that particular song for quite a while now and I've listened to it quite a lot.
6977334	6979396	And I think it's a wonderful cover.
6979476	6980096	It's fun.
6980857	6983539	But I don't think it's cage-matchy, so it gets a seven and a half.
6983559	6983639	Loki.
6984480	6984820	Loki.
6985572	6990376	It was all I got in five minutes, so it gets an eight.
6991858	6995481	My synopsis, somewhere the disco train derailed.
6995661	6996442	I give it a five.
6997183	7001066	It was the crazy train, not the disco train.
7001506	7006251	All right, boys and girls, we're going to recap the three songs, and then you get to place your vote.
7006291	7010655	Song number one you can vote for tonight is Girls and Boys.
7020450	7034997	and song number two you can vote for tonight is Exodus 04 by Utada and song number three you can vote for tonight is Ozzy Osbourne with Stayin' Alive that just cracks me up to say
7040728	7043250	Please vote now.
7043470	7053039	Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote for song number one, The Blur, song number two, The Utada, or song number three, The Aussie.
7053279	7053639	I don't know.
7053719	7056221	I think Stand Alive would be cool if it was in Guitar Freaks.
7057322	7057963	Now, that would be cool.
7058163	7061926	You know, there's the Guitar Heroes coming out, and it's supposed to have a lot of covers.
7061966	7063788	It's going to have Bowie in it, which is cool.
7064148	7065849	It's going to have Hendrix.
7065889	7067551	It's going to be the total stoner game.
7068755	7071078	Guitar Freaks needs something different.
7071098	7074401	They really, I'm very disappointed that they got rid of Keyboard Mania.
7075062	7075503	Me too.
7075523	7082811	I mean, that was kind of, they should have instead of getting rid of games that plug with Guitar Freaks, they should have added stuff to it.
7082931	7083171	Mm-hmm.
7083632	7091958	Like, maybe a karaoke game to go with it, you know, and you can sing the vocals to the songs, or maybe, I don't know, another instrument or something that they could be playing?
7091978	7092938	Yeah, I know, I know.
7093459	7102485	Keyboard Mania, the reason why I'm pissed off that Konami got rid of Keyboard Mania is because Keyboard Mania was a one-but-money game that it was actually pretty good at, that a lot of people don't take the time to be good at.
7102785	7107267	And so I got really good at Keyboard Mania, and it was, like, I wasn't blue good, but I was good.
7107628	7110389	I can actually pass songs on doubles, which I think is good.
7111109	7114371	And I can pass, like, six, like, I can pass, like, you know, most of the six stars.
7114411	7120094	I think the only one I could never pass was the crazy one from, I don't even remember the name of it, it's been so long since I've played.
7120314	7124096	But it pissed me off, because I was like, you know, I could have, I could have been really good.
7124176	7127578	I could have been a contender at Keyboard Mania, and they went and pulled the plug on my game.
7127598	7127938	Bastard.
7128547	7128727	D.R.O.S.C.
7128767	7129428	Psychopath Edition
7149181	7151602	because most of the entries dropped out.
7151742	7153563	So, yeah, eight songs.
7154203	7161266	The theme of this mix was basically, or this contest was basically... Dude, I got eighth place in the SimFile competition.
7161346	7161806	I rock.
7162286	7164467	No, it's basically funny songs.
7164567	7165207	That was the point.
7165988	7172450	So they picked funny songs, did step files for them, and right now, basically, you can go download them.
7172490	7177813	It's on the front page of MyStyle, and there's reviews and discussion.
7178413	7179013	So go check them out.
7179312	7179592	I guess.
7180672	7183293	And I'm sure there's another tourney mix coming and we don't care.
7186913	7188054	What number tourney mix is this?
7188474	7189394	I think that'd be six.
7191634	7192774	What happened to tourney mix five?
7193534	7195015	No, five happened.
7195635	7195975	I thought.
7195995	7197655	I thought five happened.
7198375	7199135	I don't keep track of it.
7199155	7200456	I don't follow that stuff anymore.
7200496	7202136	Maybe five didn't happen.
7202196	7203276	Maybe it was four I'm thinking of.
7203676	7206157	Anyway, so five, tourney mix five is supposed to happen.
7206177	7208077	The rules are going to get more retarded and
7209253	7216777	Honestly, it's... Are they going to remove the names of the people who made the... No, no, no, the one intelligent... We've been saying this for years.
7216917	7221860	The way to make Tourney Mix fair is to remove the names of the people who made the step files until the end.
7222460	7224441	That's the way to do it.
7224521	7230484	That's the only way you can judge fairly instead of making it just a popularity contest.
7230584	7234166	But no, they're not going to do that because they're retarded.
7234266	7235246	So, whatever.
7236207	7236587	I don't care.
7238988	7244111	and nothing else going on as far as Japanese mix type things.
7244952	7248293	No one's really making any progress, so who knows.
7249594	7251255	Everyone's busy playing games or something.
7253976	7254977	Alright.
7255037	7255197	Yeah.
7256458	7257258	Should we go to a call?
7257278	7260360	We're getting a call on the Skype line even though I had it turned off, but why not, huh?
7260460	7260820	Sure.
7260840	7261320	Alright, why not?
7261340	7262201	We'll pick up this call.
7263922	7265343	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
7267424	7267744	Hello?
7267784	7267884	Hello?
7270603	7274165	Hi, Turnimix 5 came out a while ago.
7274405	7275146	I think it was last year.
7276246	7287432	You can see how much... You know what, honestly, I have to admit, I kind of got off the Turnimix train a while ago just because it was kind of getting... To me, in my opinion, it was getting way overrated.
7287712	7289813	Like, people were taking Turnimix way too seriously.
7290153	7293735	And taking the people that were successful in Turnimix way too seriously.
7294135	7299718	And there would be good stuff that would be put in Turnimix that nobody would download because they didn't know the person who did it.
7300279	7307633	I don't pay any attention to forum drama, I just download the actual songs and everything and delete the ones I don't like.
7312088	7315170	Tons of new step files for your step mania.
7315390	7322595	And I'll tell you what, one other good thing about it is that I actually pick up usually a couple new good songs that I like that I wouldn't have thought to download before.
7322755	7326057	Because there's a couple people out there that have similar taste in music than I do.
7326117	7326657	Who would have thought?
7326978	7329539	And so sometimes I find good new music through Tournament Mix.
7329619	7332361	So for that, I support it, but that's about it.
7333822	7337725	Yeah, I mean, I don't even know who are on any of them because I just don't pay attention.
7337745	7338105	Mm-hmm.
7339144	7342691	You know, it's just, I don't care who wins, I just care about, you know, what's there.
7342972	7344174	Do you ever enter these things?
7345377	7345577	What?
7345737	7347100	Do you ever enter the competitions?
7347160	7349385	Oh no, I don't make any sim files because I'm not very good.
7350938	7352899	You know what my problem with making sim files is?
7352979	7359245	I make heavy steps, and then I don't have the time or effort to make standard or light steps.
7359865	7362047	Nobody's paying me to do it, so I don't have any incentive.
7362267	7364950	And then my art skills are ass-tastic.
7365310	7367812	I cannot draw backgrounds for crap.
7368193	7375819	And honestly, it's kind of sad, but if you have a good background, it'll make your step file ten times better in some people's opinions.
7376139	7377941	So for that reason, I don't do step files.
7380044	7381385	Was I supposed to identify myself?
7381745	7382805	Yeah, what's your name?
7384166	7389428	GameBoyGuy13 Hello GameBoyGuy13 Are you also DSGuy13 or are you just strictly GameBoy?
7391789	7405676	I don't have a DS because I don't have money That's a reason that stops a lot of us from getting a DS, so I sympathize with you there I don't even have an SP, I want one but don't have one Oh no, so you're playing on an old style Advance?
7406496	7408697	Yeah, just an Advance Do you have a backlight on it?
7410126	7410986	No, it's an advance.
7411326	7415327	Well, yeah, but, you know, you can get those things modded, put afterburners in them.
7416868	7417948	You poor guy.
7418188	7418588	My God.
7418928	7422029	The first wave of Game Boy Advances were bad.
7422229	7423089	I mean, for that reason.
7423129	7424910	It needed a backlight so bad.
7425130	7427670	But you were a brave man for putting up with it this whole time.
7428450	7432671	What's really funny is I went in a used game store and found a really old Game Boy for like five bucks.
7433892	7435812	I considered buying it, but decided not to.
7436112	7437412	One of the old paperweight Game Boys?
7438293	7438913	Yeah.
7441058	7447326	I would buy a Virtual Boy for $5 just so I can give my friends headaches.
7447886	7449808	Come here, play this cool new game I got.
7449829	7450549	Hey, I have one.
7451130	7451711	Do you really?
7452449	7453009	I thought you knew.
7453710	7456851	Well, you have every system under the sun, so it really shouldn't be a surprise.
7457351	7462194	We need to do a show at your house eventually and whip out all the old game systems and play them on air.
7462514	7464715	I am not going to play the Virtual Boy.
7465135	7467296	I will drink and play Virtual Boy on air.
7467677	7471979	I can't play that for more than five minutes without getting a raging headache that makes me have to pass out.
7472819	7473599	What games do you have?
7474980	7475660	Oh, hell if I know.
7475681	7476521	I don't touch the damn thing.
7477113	7479774	Do you have the Mario Crash or whatever it was?
7480094	7482455	Yeah, and Tennis and something else.
7483095	7484396	I remember the old stupid commercials.
7485936	7488717	By the way, yes, Loki, I forgot to mention.
7489057	7491558	Tourney Mix 6 is actually going on right now.
7492899	7497140	And they call it Tourney Mix Final because, thank God, they're not doing it anymore.
7497820	7499401	Basically, it says...
7500221	7502422	The deadline for registration is July 25th.
7502462	7504903	Deadline for file submission is the 29th.
7504983	7507464	Your basic rules format here.

7515647	7520848	Anyways, DDR East Coast Invasion, which is a site that I haven't been to in a long time.
7522829	7524370	Wow, and it's working so well, too.
7524890	7527051	Anyways, the info, you can find it there...
7529212	7530093	Yeah, okay, we get it.
7530153	7530753	It's Turnimix.
7531113	7531753	It hasn't changed.
7531874	7534015	Anyway, anything else you want to share with us, Game Boy Guy?
7534575	7534935	Oh, oh.
7534995	7535636	Not really.
7536036	7537677	Okay, then, Game Boy Guy, I'm going to say goodbye.
7537897	7539298	But thank you for calling in, and have a great night.
7540258	7540859	Uh-huh, you too.
7540959	7541259	Later.
7542519	7542860	Get this.

7557768	7562713	You may use songs from other rhythm and game music, or rhythm and game music games.
7562753	7564075	Hooray, more 2DX whores.
7564255	7564835	No, no, no, no.

7595502	7604306	Tsugaru Four, whatever, Su Four, whatever that is, plus one, basically, it's like, I don't know, B4U Max plus zero.
7605026	7605847	Plus zero?
7605887	7606367	What's the point?
7606670	7610373	Basically, they're talking about how good the remixes are.
7611033	7612815	So, yeah, whatever.
7612835	7613335	Whatever.
7613976	7620961	If it's over 2 minutes 40 seconds, you get a 5-point deduction, and it keeps going up from there.
7623042	7623643	It's just like...
7625033	7627876	Basically, they score you on background animations, one point.
7627896	7628716	Movies, one point.
7629377	7630698	Challenge steps, one point.

7649374	7651556	Each week, a bracket will be released to the public.
7652076	7652817	And it says...
7654065	7655685	Public will have no say in the first round.
7655725	7657046	Public's sway has been removed.
7658186	7658506	Good.
7659726	7660286	Let's see here.
7660746	7673289	The number of judges will be working on 10 points for light, 25 for standard, 50 for heavy, 5 points for appropriate danceable step file, 5 points for readme, 5 points for background and banner.
7673309	7675189	Let's see.

7678530	7682891	Total of 100 extra entries plus 5 penalties minus 35.
7684491	7684951	Yeah, I know.
7684991	7702464	It's basically... Anyways, I'm just trying to see how... I was trying to see if they had the actual... whether or not the people's names would be displayed, but it does not say, so I'm going to have to assume that's a yes.
7703464	7706186	If you're really interested, ddrei.com.
7706566	7707167	Have fun.
7707207	7708328	It's the last one, thank God.
7708688	7709048	All right.
7709608	7711210	You guys want to hear who won tonight's cage match?
7712350	7712651	I guess.
7712971	7713211	All right.
7713834	7715375	Tonight was a landslide victory, by the way.
7715395	7716336	We haven't had one of these in a while.
7716356	7719257	We've had a lot of ties lately, but tonight was a freaking landslide.
7719417	7719638	Yeah.
7719998	7720758	Yep, it sure was.
7721218	7723120	So here it is, tonight's winner, boys and girls.
7725821	7726702	Ozzy Osbourne.
7729564	7730344	Stayin' alive.
7731265	7732205	Sheep, all of you.
7734366	7734767	Alright.
7736047	7738829	All aboard the disco train!
7739269	7739910	Oh, no, no, no, no.
7739930	7740250	Sharon!
7740270	7740810	Sharon!
7742251	7743072	Sharon!
7744201	7745061	Alright, let's take a break.
7745081	7745701	We're going to take a break.
7745722	7748202	When we come back, we'll get into the FUs of the week, most definitely.
7748862	7752023	Also, if somebody else wants to give us a call via Skype, talk about Happy Sky a little bit.
7752464	7756045	And whatever else we can dig out of our butts when we come back from this break.
7756185	7756785	Lots of poo.
7757525	7758225	Let's start off with this.
7759086	7762447	Some poor person in the chatroom has been begging me to play this song all night long.
7762467	7762887	So here it is.
7762907	7767008	We're going to start it out with a song called 12th Style, which is what the game should be called.
7767148	7767448	Damn it.
7768029	7768989	So here it is, 12th Style.
7769009	7770309	We'll be back with more.
7771009	7772650	Happy Orange Lounge Radio after this.
7775945	7777510	Thanks for watching!
7898186	7899206	Loki, what did you think of that song?
7900527	7901408	I thought it was lame.
7902849	7904010	Here's some Akira Yamaoka then.
8076620	8077423	DarkSakura
8116332	8117175	Thanks for watching!
8140592	8144173	Have you ever walked into Radio Shack and hit the demo button on all the keyboards?
8146154	8149896	So that you have like 60 keyboard demos all playing over the top of each other all at once.
8149916	8150716	That sounded like yuck.
8150896	8152717	That's what that song sounded like to me.
8152937	8154738	Honestly, that sounded like me playing the keyboard.
8154818	8157479	And I can't play the keyboard, so that's what it would sound like.
8158621	8161082	That was just a bunch of random notes and beats.
8161142	8163603	It just had nothing to... It was not even a song.
8163843	8164624	Needs more cowbell.
8165604	8166905	Exactly.
8167225	8168346	Needs less suckiness.
8168726	8173188	Where they have some... I had my cat walk across the keyboard.
8173668	8174649	One more song to go, please.
8174769	8175229	Good, cool.
8175669	8175989	Here it is.
8176189	8176529	Good, cool.
8187706	8189073	and beyond which there is so much more.
8234282	8251429	I know it's hard to really love someone It takes a long time to trust someone But I don't care how long it will take My love is of so much So be brave and let me show you
8292422	8302826	Hi, we're back with more Orange Lounge Radio.
8303947	8311150	That was an okay song, that good, cool, except you could totally tell that that was a key sound rip from the game because, like, the singing sound.
8311210	8312270	It's pretty bad.
8316753	8319696	First Resolution was the name of that song.
8319716	8323961	100% Mini Moog was the one that sounded like 60 RadioShack keyboard demos all going over each other.
8324461	8327705	And Akira Yamaoka, Empty of the Sky, which I kind of like that song, I dig that.
8327965	8331369	And we're Akira Yamaoka whores here, so we have to play all of his new songs every day.
8332109	8335173	And then 12th Style, of course, starting that set off, which Loki didn't like.
8335733	8337255	He just wanted to share that with you guys, he didn't like that one.
8339397	8343978	Skypline's open because I know we had at least one more personal one to get in, so call in.
8345339	8361504	During the break there, it was being suggested, and now they're telling me to talk about this, it was being suggested that if Konami were to continue DDR, they should put out, which we really hope they do in the arcades, but they should put out DDR ABBA mix, which would be nothing but ABBA songs.
8361744	8364125	They already canceled the SMOP mix.
8364585	8364965	SMOP?
8365405	8367886	It's basically the Japanese version of Medudo.
8369039	8369459	Really?
8369739	8373601	Yeah, it was in the works a few years ago and they axed it.
8373901	8374601	You know what was funny?
8375601	8377362	You heard all that news about Live 8, right?
8379063	8380003	I tried to ignore all of it.
8380143	8384505	Well, Dreams Come True played the Japanese Live 8 and that just made me laugh for some reason, I don't know.
8384525	8387246	I was like, oh, Dreams Come True, they're still around, who knew?
8387546	8388606	Hi, you're on Orange Songs Radio.
8389346	8390347	It's Guy, Siggy here.
8390447	8391327	Hello, Siggy.
8391387	8392828	Oh, it's my pronunciation hero.
8392888	8393608	What's new with you?
8394702	8400645	Well, I'm just gonna, first of all, Sky, it's not Daisuki, it's Daisuke.
8401225	8402086	I like Daisuki.
8403467	8405007	Actually, it's not a ke, it is a ki.
8406028	8407569	It's ke, Daisuke.
8410350	8413092	There is not a ke sound in a ki spelling.
8413112	8415473	Hello, it's Japanese.
8415813	8422917	I know, and the I ones are all i, a, i, u, e, o, ma, mi, mu, me, mo, ta, chi, tu, te, to, right?
8425101	8429402	That's right!
8429442	8430042	I see.
8430783	8431323	So what's on your mind?
8431343	8432563	What did you call in to talk to us about tonight?
8432843	8438265	Well, I just want to say, you know, I just want to pronounce the songs on Happy Sky Daughter in Japanese.
8438365	8438965	Sounds good.
8440065	8442846	And what songs are these that you want to share with us?
8443386	8449868	The artist's name is Chonan Chiharu, and the song title is Rakuen, which means paradise.
8450128	8450468	Mm-hmm.
8452273	8463616	And then, well, this one's not really Japanese, but, you know, it's a very hard, you know, pronunciation, very foreign one, which is the Akira Yamaoka song is Ton Pi Pour Trois.
8464256	8466297	Right, which is kind of more French than anything else.
8466717	8471178	Yeah, and thanks to Sakurina, she corrected me on what it means.
8471218	8472578	It means too bad for you.
8473899	8474839	Too bad for you.
8474919	8476139	This is a little bit of that song there.
8476159	8477500	We played that a little earlier in the show.
8477540	8477880	Okay.
8477900	8478600	Mm-hmm.
8479028	8480929	And then there's by Tomosuke.
8482090	8484011	The song title is Tizona del Cid.
8484531	8487273	Okay, we have a little bit of that one here too.
8490434	8491495	It's a little jazzy.
8491975	8494157	Come on down and play 2DX Happy Sky.
8494297	8496718	All this can be yours if you put in a quarter.
8497879	8501281	And then there's Captivate Joker.
8502962	8505123	Okay, we have a little piece of that song.
8505163	8505463	Hold on.
8509241	8512262	Which is the remix of the 2DX Red ending.
8512902	8513542	Oh, okay.
8513982	8515882	I thought this sounded a little bit familiar when I first heard it.
8515902	8516883	I was like, where have I heard this before?
8517203	8517503	Okay.
8518663	8523844	And then there's the one by Hoshino Kanako is Gekko, which means moonlight.
8526045	8528405	Which I don't know.
8528465	8529005	Who did that one?
8530165	8532806	I think, I believe it was by Hoshino Kanako.
8533586	8534846	I don't know if I have that one handy.
8535747	8537147	Okay, but okay, so there's that one.
8538257	8540237	Yeah, and then the E-Amusement songs.
8541058	8542758	Oh, I don't even know if I have those.
8542978	8543238	Yeah?
8544238	8545659	Agnus Dei by Asaki.
8546119	8547219	Oh, okay, I do have that one.
8547239	8548639	So I do have some of these E-Amuse songs.
8548679	8548919	Goodie.
8553020	8560142	Speaking of Asaki, the Guitar Freaks Drum Mania artist, Asaki, is currently working on an album.
8561062	8563943	His very first project album.
8564283	8564703	Oh, really?
8564723	8564803	Yeah.
8565296	8567377	Yeah, which is scheduled to be released September 16th.
8567397	8567957	Also, Good Cool.
8568117	8569258	Good Cool is also making Greatest Hits.
8588886	8593547	A Greatest Hits Album Yeah, I think I saw it on KonamiStyle Oh, what's that?
8593587	8594747	I've been following that.
8594827	8595767	Oh, Double... Okay, what's that?
8595787	8595867	Yeah
8613790	8616092	I'll just mention all of them in order.
8616272	8638390	It's Ace, Double Ace, Blocks, Colors Radio Edit, Fake Time, Gigadelic, Innocent Walls, Moonchild, One More Lovely, 108, Piano Kyosok Kyoku Daichiba Sasoribi, or Piano Concerto Anti-Ares, or Scorpion Fire, Please Don't Go, Sakura... Really?
8638430	8640011	Please Don't Go is a new one, isn't it?
8640885	8643167	Sakura, Setsugekka, Spyka, Stoick, and lastly V
8664485	8667607	Samurai, Ace, Double Ace, Blox, Cheer Train, Dixie, or DXY Dixie?
8667627	8669568	I've never heard it pronounced Dixie.
8693399	8694779	It's actually pronounced Dixie.
8696900	8704783	Oh my god, but if I were to call it Dixie, I'd think... Which is so not the song.
8706403	8708604	I can't call it Dixie, I can't, I'm sorry.
8709124	8710685	That's going to have to stay in Japan.
8710705	8711825	It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter.
8711845	8712625	Alright, alright, fine.
8713205	8721008	And then Era Stepmix, Big Time, G2, Garden, Genocide, Ghost Revival, Holic, Inazuma...
8721628	8747499	Innocent Walls, Jam, Kakumei, Karma, Lesson 5, Logic Board, Love is Eternity, Lower World, Minimalian, Nemesis, Number 13, One More Lovely, Piano Kiyosaki, Daichiban Sasoribi, Wazor, I'm just kidding, Wristlim Remix, Sakura, Setsugekka, Sig Sig, Sphere, Spike, Spica, Starmind, Stoic, and Zephyr.
8748407	8752305	That's a shitload of flashing 12s on doubles, but you know doubles is some scary shit.
8752345	8753249	Do you play doubles at all?
8754168	8755449	I've never played doubles.
8755709	8759411	I'm trying to play on normal when I have another controller.
8759631	8761051	I'm waiting for it for the US release.
8762352	8770376	You know what, that's why I've been kind of holding off on playing the 2DX at home lately, because I'm holding off, because my controller sucks balls.
8770776	8777739	And I'm looking forward to being able to get cheap controllers here, because I'm thinking, what, the controllers here are going to cost, what, maybe $39.95?
8777979	8778340	Maybe?
8778600	8779660	I don't know, don't quote me on this.
8779900	8780541	You think more?
8781221	8783362	I can get confirmation very soon on that.
8783829	8784210	Really?
8784870	8786272	You've got some hookup I don't know about.
8786372	8789676	Well, that's because they send price lists to GameStop before they put the stuff out.
8789736	8790377	Find that shit out.
8790397	8791057	For pre-orders.
8791458	8791878	I want to know.
8792499	8792779	Really?
8793440	8794902	More than $40 for the controller?
8794942	8795523	I would think so.
8796183	8796924	Logically, I would think so.
8796944	8797385	I hope not.
8797685	8799988	You know some other company is going to put out a cheap one, though.
8800008	8802971	But, of course, you have to go the regular Konami one because the other ones are going to suck.
8803868	8806929	You know, wait a second, I'll get the prices of them off Konami Style.
8807010	8811072	You know, there were rumors going around that they were going to improve the controller when they released it here.
8811092	8812912	I don't know if that's still true, but that would be nice.
8813052	8815013	It's going to cost a significant amount, I'll put it that way.
8815514	8815934	Oh, damn.
8816094	8818775	Alright, sorry about that, Siggy, we just had to have that little discussion.
8818795	8819416	That's alright, that's alright.
8819436	8821877	Have you heard anything about the 2DX controllers being released over here?
8822757	8824318	Um, no, none so far.
8824338	8826739	Because I can tell you at E3 they just had the Japanese ones.
8827059	8831461	I looked, I looked, I wanted to see if it was different, but it was just the regular Japanese ones.
8831982	8832542	Yeah, I saw.
8833115	8842218	And from what I've heard, from what I've read on the Japanese forums and message boards, Eden is the continuation of the video doll.
8842798	8844198	That's what somebody was saying in the chat room earlier.
8844218	8845439	I don't know if that was you or somebody else.
8845659	8849560	I've heard about that, and a lot of the anime fanboys especially really like the doll videos.
8849580	8849980	That's good.
8851621	8855422	One of my favorite parts of 2DX is the videos, so I really like hearing when they do...
8856562	8869646	I just read something interesting.
8869686	8871687	I think this is a goalie art book.
8872447	8873087	Oh, I heard about this.
8873107	8873627	Konami style.
8873887	8874908	Yeah, that's good.
8875288	8876888	I'm not bringing up any images right now.
8876908	8878709	Isn't that going to be a great coffee table book to have?
8879229	8882090	Yeah, it'll have to go with my DDR second mixed step book.
8883670	8883910	Anyway.
8884251	8885591	Alright, anything else on your mind today, Siggy?
8886495	8887216	One more thing.
8888537	8899028	The videos for e-amusement songs like Agnes Day and Pink Rose and stuff, they were actually recycled from Guitar Fix Drum Mania.
8900329	8903572	Oh, so the Guitar Fix, okay, that's kind of cool.
8903792	8910459	And then Pink Rose, I saw the video, and it's like a modified version from the keyboard mania.
8911084	8912624	That's kind of cool.
8913285	8913965	Oh, that's kind of neat.
8914005	8917566	Well, I mean, it's okay for them to recycle stuff if, you know, it's good stuff to begin with.
8918366	8921567	And then for Votum Stellarum, it's an original.
8922407	8922787	Oh, cool.
8923187	8930790	And then they, whatchamacallit, they gathered all the videos from DJ Taka.
8931870	8932050	Oh.
8932970	8935611	Like, they mixed them all in one, and then in the last part...
8937882	8943650	They just featured the video for V where Tran is walking down the spiral staircase.
8944951	8948636	That's the last part for Votum Stellarum, the video.
8949677	8950679	Okay, well, I can see that.
8950699	8951340	That kind of fits.
8952201	8952341	Hmm.
8953581	8954101	Pretty cool.
8954502	8958144	I'm hoping that a Happy Sky Machine shows up nearby at some point.
8958204	8961046	And by nearby, I mean if I have to go to SoCal to play it, then I do.
8962087	8964088	So I can check this out, because I want to see this.
8964188	8965969	I still have not played 2DX Red, really.
8966710	8969932	But we won't be able to see the e-amusement songs, unfortunately.
8971213	8973435	Oh, yeah, because that whole hookup is missing here.
8973495	8973735	I know.
8973755	8975316	It kind of sucks.
8976296	8976577	All right.
8977057	8978018	Well, thanks for the call, Siggy.
8978578	8978858	All right.
8978938	8979759	I always appreciate it.
8979799	8982661	As always, you stay on top of the 2DX stuff more than we do, so we appreciate it.
8983413	8983633	Yeah.
8983833	8984633	Alright, take care, bud.
8985313	8985834	Alright, later.
8985934	8986134	Later.
8987354	8991535	Our buddy Siggy there from Vegas calling in to talk about 2DX.
8993536	8995656	And of course the chat room is yelling, what about ToeJam?
8995676	8996496	What about ToeJam?
8999357	9005518	Of course, ToeJam being a transplant song from Ultramix 2, which was kind of one of the weird ones there.
9005719	9007259	ToeJam is also an EMU song.
9007499	9007959	Yeah, I know that.
9008019	9008699	I know that's what I meant.
9009099	9009419	Hello.
9011380	9011740	That's all right.
9012466	9016169	Okay, anyway, I think it's about time to get into the FUs of the week.
9016209	9019212	This is the part of the show where we get downright angsty.
9020032	9021533	Because we're mad, we're upset, grr.
9021974	9027078	So, DarkSakura, why is it that we do... By the way, if you guys have your own FUs, you can send them in right now.
9027358	9030501	But DarkSakura, why is it that we do these FUs of the week every single week?
9031822	9032322	Uh...
9042785	9047787	My first FU goes toward having to sit at family functions with a bunch of people I don't know.
9048227	9050647	With many people in there.
9051288	9056149	In the more wealthy part of the area.
9056689	9057149	You know what?
9057350	9058730	I don't want to be wealthy.
9058810	9063691	I would rather be comfortable and happy and be a real person, you know.
9064012	9064932	I mean, they're nice and everything.
9064952	9065372	Don't get me wrong.
9065392	9065892	They're nice.
9065952	9066692	They're great people.
9067333	9071774	I just don't think that I could stand having to keep up illusions all the time.
9072953	9074955	if I had a bunch of money, I don't think I would act like it
9086873	9110392	I mean just in here I know, I know, but we got the air conditioner going, doing the best we can Another FU goes towards my hoid digestion problems That's it, I'm done Oh yeah, this book is, you know, FU to my fiance Freaking finishing a book before me Butthead, I told you to wait Dang, that was quick
9112140	9115703	I would have read it this fast, I've just had other real life things to do.
9116904	9123330	I'm reading it right now.
9123810	9125292	Good participation tonight, by the way.
9125452	9127834	Oh, I'm participating and reading.
9127994	9128815	I am talented.
9128835	9129776	You're multitasking.
9130076	9130917	Yeah, multitasking.
9130957	9131417	Like a Mac.
9132198	9134000	Like a Mac, except I'm a lot cooler.
9134981	9137183	Alright, let's get to Loki's FUs of the week then.
9141571	9143153	I'm a good driver.
9156547	9160550	Before you start saying that, listen, okay, I said most of the population.
9160610	9165394	Unless you want to, you know, make noise and put yourself as part of that, you know, percentage, then no.
9165954	9171578	This is especially appalling because, you know, I'm always wondering why the problem isn't solved around here.
9172139	9176482	Well, today, on my way over to the studio, there was a cop that pulled out in front of me.
9176882	9178924	First blew through the red light like nothing.
9179084	9183987	And I'm talking about not stopping under red to make a right-hand turn, just, you know, completely blown through, cutting me off.
9184628	9186009	Which is fine, it's a cop, you know.
9187307	9193548	Then she proceeds to get into the right turn lane, to which then she goes straight cutting me off again.
9194189	9203491	Then she goes and makes another right-hand turn without stopping at all at the stop sign, and flips a bitch right there in the middle of the street, and guess what?
9203511	9204971	She's on her fucking cell phone.
9205031	9206051	A goddamn cop!
9206432	9212413	Fuck you, Sacramento PD, and your stupid female cop that was driving down, you know, the road here.
9213345	9228572	I mean, god damn it, you guys are supposed to set an example of what's right, and here she's violating all the traffic laws, going, I'm talking on my cell phone, you know, the hell with you people, no wonder your problem's not getting solved, I'm gonna talk to my congressman, god damn it, and get that stupid cell phone law passed.
9229993	9231534	Then we'll work on the female driving issue.
9233615	9233995	Wow.
9234355	9238137	Fuck you to the fact that my air conditioning's not working in our apartment.
9238615	9244080	For some reason, I think there's a leak in the Freon hose, because they filled it up about a month ago, and now there's none.
9244620	9253008	So, that would lead me to believe that either there's some Freon fairy that's stealing the Freon in the middle of the night, or there might be a hole in the hose, okay?
9253088	9254309	So, well, that sucks.
9254469	9257352	And, luckily for me, though, I have to babysit the dog.
9257772	9264478	Which brings me to my next FU, because that stupid dog wants to wake me up three times during the night because it's used to a routine.
9265288	9269231	That routine being to wake me up three times during the night and piss me off.
9270712	9271873	Fucking hate that dog.
9272133	9273154	I gotta do this for a week.
9275075	9287585	And then finally, fuck you to the people that made the stupid Hanzo the Razor movie because no samurai movie should be about some guy that mutilates his penis to then to have sex with women to interrogate them.
9288405	9290807	That's not a samurai movie, that's a porno movie.
9291468	9292528	Don't get too confused.
9294250	9294630	That's all.
9304845	9309608	I want to give an F you to the fact that I'm total retard in general.
9310129	9325802	No, but when it comes to hooking up the Xbox to the new HDTV, because I use the Xbox as a DVD player, because believe it or not, the Xbox actually makes a pretty decent DVD player, but I cannot for the life of me figure out how to get Component and get the really pretty HD picture via the Xbox.
9326062	9331046	And I went to GameStop and they didn't know, and I went to RadioShack and they didn't know, and I went to Target and, well, shit, they're never any help.
9331462	9332623	to buy the component cables.
9332703	9338588	Okay, neither of these stores, none of these stores have them for the Xbox, and I'm starting to wonder if they even exist, so I have to do research online later.
9339348	9340790	Somebody in the chatroom needs to help me out.
9340850	9341370	Got a Best Buy.
9341911	9344553	Yeah, I'm thinking Best Buy might have them, so I'll check that out a little later.
9345193	9346735	Anyway, so an F you to that.
9346755	9347916	An F you to Impulse Buying.
9347936	9349717	I can't believe they don't have them at GameStop.
9349977	9350618	I've seen them there.
9351018	9353060	Well, they didn't have it at this one, so F you to this GameStop.
9353580	9357023	And an F you to Impulse Buying, because I just bought a multi-hundred dollar TV today.
9357303	9357784	But that's alright.
9358544	9359025	I deserved it.
9360805	9363826	I was a good boy this year, and I deserved a good present.
9364266	9366086	It's kind of a late birthday present to myself, really.
9367967	9370828	And, um... Gosh, I think that's really it.
9371668	9372628	Oh, oh, oh.
9373549	9378590	F you to the impending nurses strike at UC Davis, because it's going to postpone my dad's surgery again.
9379110	9380050	Again, for the second time.
9380390	9383591	And I realize, you know, nurses, they need their rights and everything, too.
9383651	9386012	So just F you to the timing of the whole thing.
9386653	9388535	Yeah, just screwing it all up.
9388595	9390196	Especially those male nurses.
9392798	9393279	Stop it.
9395781	9398564	Alright, let's get to the chatroom FUs, shall we?
9400785	9412536	Let's see... Rini would like to give an FU to my PlayStation 2 for screwing up my speedruns in Katamari Damacy, because the analog feature kept dying on my brand new controller.
9414195	9417461	Sakura S1N F you to my nephew for being a retard and just being a stupid dumbass
9424386	9431569	Misty would like to say, fuck the person that broke the subwoofer caging on the Indigroup 2 dedicated cabinet at tea time.
9431949	9435150	If I ever find out who it was and I actually meet them, there's gonna be hell to pay.
9435611	9437791	Especially if it's somewhere that's not one of my arcades.
9438392	9444414	I hope they decide to keep the machine, and one goes to Loki, because as I typed this out, I was thinking he's probably gonna laugh or something when he hears this.
9444774	9447215	He actually just ran to the bathroom, so he got away with it.
9448356	9452157	Misty says, also, I want to pass this one along from a friend that doesn't have IRC.
9452537	9454038	Fuck all the Harry Potter spoilers.
9455475	9457296	Double amen to that, although I've been lucky.
9457756	9459096	Sakurina is a guy.
9459156	9465518	Says, F you to myself for eating too much tonight and suffering a stomach ache.
9466099	9469780	An F you to the heat here, especially since we celebrated Christmas today early.
9470240	9471621	That's kind of early.
9474782	9475262	Let's see.
9475542	9479843	Jammer J would like to send an F you to roof repairs after hurricanes.
9480104	9480364	Ouch.
9480604	9481264	Sorry to hear about that.
9482176	9487979	Reznor says an insane fuck you to Sony for making it so damn hard to become a Jedi in Star Wars Galaxies.
9488379	9490320	And fuck you to the Mac haters out there.
9490380	9490800	You hear that?
9491460	9495062	And fuck you to Logitech for making a shitty joystick that doesn't work worth anything.
9496923	9499924	I'm so sorry if I fuck up this pronunciation.
9500144	9507088	Kamui, Kamui, Kamui, 988 says, I say F you to being broke and my laggy as hell Windows computer.
9507328	9509849	Well, my laggy XP craptacular computer.
9511354	9512735	Illusion, we have a lot of FU's tonight.
9512935	9516398	Illusion says, FU to getting a fever this weekend and not being able to go to a party.
9516518	9517899	It was lame being sick.
9519140	9521682	GameBoyGuy13 wants to just give an FU to Max.
9524224	9527927	Ron Chan would like to say, FU to my family for being dipshits all you die already.
9528147	9535133	FU to my friend Carmen for only showing up in the city every six months and hanging out with her causing me to miss most of Orange Lounge Radio.
9535533	9536474	Visit more, woman!
9537295	9538796	Is that Carmen San Diego?
9539156	9540017	No, I don't think it is.
9541638	9543899	VidPower would like to say, can F you to lint?
9545059	9545539	I agree.
9546099	9546700	Lint is annoying.
9546940	9548040	Where does lint come from?
9548080	9548900	That's what I want to know.
9549000	9551021	I never really bothered to read on it.
9551361	9551961	But where?
9554022	9555542	The lint wasn't on the shirt when I bought it.
9555643	9559804	You notice how your shirts become a little bit thin and you can start seeing through them?
9560744	9562545	F you to whoever can't design a shirt right.
9563165	9569387	Last up, DarkSetsuya says, F you to whatever's causing the voices to be really quiet on Fox.
9570951	9571631	So guess what?
9573132	9574773	Maybe it's time to stop watching Family Guy.
9574813	9576874	I ran in there to watch a part of Family Guy.
9577574	9578315	God damn you!
9578995	9579816	God damn you!
9581016	9586179	And they were talking about how Peter is fascinated with the world of never-ending story.
9586539	9590541	And he was riding Falcor and he was too heavy so Falcor crashed into the ground.
9591041	9591762	That's hilarious.
9592202	9595063	Will you stop giving free plugs to the competition?
9595123	9596404	I love that show!
9596424	9597845	Family Guy is our competition now.
9597885	9598465	You must hate it.
9598925	9600486	I watch every episode.
9601116	9603457	on repeats on the internet.
9603597	9604637	On BitTorrent, yeah.
9604657	9605137	On BitTorrent.
9605177	9605658	That's fine.
9605678	9606378	It's TiVo.
9607238	9608118	I call it TiVo.
9611459	9611739	All right.
9612200	9613260	We're going to go to a quick break.
9613280	9613920	Just a couple songs.
9613940	9616601	Then we're going to come back and we're going to do some Ask Orange Lounge.
9617061	9619142	It's your guys' chance to control the show.
9619182	9620922	And I notice we have a lot of new listeners tonight.
9620942	9623063	And I'm wondering if that's coming from the podcast or what.
9623543	9626644	But it's your chance to ask us any question you want within reason.
9626944	9627545	Keep it clean.
9627585	9628445	Speaking of which...
9629065	9630967	Go to podcastawards.com.
9630987	9635351	You'll notice at the bottom of the page to the right, you'll see the best video game podcast.
9635391	9636272	And, oh, look in there.
9636352	9637553	It's Orange Laundry as it goes.
9637993	9640355	Vote with every single email address that you have.
9640555	9642397	Actually, you know what?
9642757	9644999	Be careful because I don't want us to get disqualified.
9645039	9648623	So if you just remember to vote every day, just use one email address is enough.
9648823	9649784	Honestly, it really is.
9650064	9651165	You don't have to worry about the multiple.
9652947	9653307	Is that okay?
9654209	9655710	Just get all of your friends to vote too.
9655910	9656551	Yeah, that's it.
9656791	9657692	You don't have to use multiple.
9657712	9660454	Just get your friends to vote from their IP addresses.
9660554	9661155	That's the thing.
9661515	9662416	That's the key.
9663256	9664057	Oh, it's fine.
9664757	9665038	All right.
9667620	9670702	Also, you should check out our podcast anyway in general because it's really cool.
9670762	9674325	And you can subscribe on iTunes and it's so easy.
9674445	9679349	All you have to do is do a search for Orange Lounge and we show up.
9679409	9679989	Imagine that.
9680610	9681871	So, listen to us.
9684341	9684681	What?
9684942	9685462	DarkSakura?
9685762	9686263	I didn't hear that.
9687523	9693188	If you do a search for DarkSakura, all one word, on Google Images, the third picture you come up with is my cat.
9695389	9696630	Do they get any pictures of you?
9696650	9699332	Because I think our listeners are curious what you look like.
9699393	9700894	They've been wanting to see your picture for forever.
9702895	9706378	All they have to do is pull up iTunes and look at our little picture there.
9707959	9713023	You can see a little teeny tiny 50, or not even 50 by 50, teeny tiny picture.
9713713	9719194	When I get back from my special break, I will post a picture in the chat room.
9720755	9721355	Yay!
9722235	9722495	Alright.
9724876	9725676	Alright, we'll be back.
9726476	9727937	We're going to play a song.
9728377	9730117	I feel like, I want to hear something from Red.
9730137	9732238	Since we've been playing Happy Sky all night, I want to hear some Red.
9732518	9733618	So we're going to get to Kikak.
9734658	9735159	Kikak.
9736139	9736859	We'll be back after this.
9783636	9785417	Thank you for watching!
10028234	10028755	Thanks for watching!
10098301	10104108	Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.
10108581	10112364	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, and it's time to get into some Ask Orange Lounge.
10112384	10118209	But first, actually, what I wanted to state, this is a response to something that was said in the chat room like an hour ago, but I forgot to respond to it.
10118709	10125295	Somebody was mentioning a Magical Drop 3 tournament, and I was like, oh my god, Magical Drop is like one of my favorite puzzle games ever.
10125595	10127136	Like, it's right up there with like Meteos.
10127597	10129778	You know, I have that on Neo Geo CD.
10129899	10131800	I have Magical Drop on my cell phone.
10132321	10133321	How hardcore is that?
10133381	10134542	Give me some credit.
10134662	10135483	I love Magical Drop.
10135523	10136384	Anyway, I just wanted to say that.
10137188	10138389	Too much metal for one hand.
10138429	10145035	Let's get into some... Oh, by the way, in that break we had Kakak from 2DX Red, Everyday Lovely Day, my favorite consumer song.
10145075	10145575	I love that song.
10146015	10146896	And Dixie.
10149158	10150419	No, I'm sorry, I can't do it without laughing.
10150459	10151960	DXY, all in that break.
10152401	10158245	But I knew if we didn't get in some taku that our one and only DarkSakura would be very upset.
10158265	10162049	Yeah, I would have screamed bloody murder and murdered everybody.
10162109	10164391	We have a freaking ton of questions tonight in Ask Orange Lounge.
10164411	10164911	Are you ready for this?
10170649	10173551	Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.
10174112	10177294	What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?
10177854	10183238	I have to admit I'm a little bit scared because there's new people listening tonight and who knows what they might submit.
10183278	10184779	It might be questions we've heard a thousand times.
10187581	10188661	It's a different song every time.
10189142	10191443	We need to make one long compilation of all this.
10191804	10193785	I am officially halfway through the book.
10195612	10198793	I like that it has purple text on black on the spine.
10200773	10205534	Rini is asking about, could you elaborate more on Togo's presence at E3?
10205594	10207775	It's the first I'm hearing about him being there.
10208115	10209135	Yeah, Togo was there.
10209615	10211356	I don't know why he was there.
10211456	10214657	I imagine, I think it has something to do with Beatmania being in the US.
10214757	10216117	I think he might be a part of that.
10216437	10246103	please don't quote me on that, I think I had heard something about that he's kind of a part of that, which makes sense, because he's been kind of heavy in the Japanese consumer style side, but I did get my picture with him so when I finally stopped being lazy and put up my picture gallery, which maybe I'll do tonight if I can tear myself away from my new HDTV he was there, Sana was not, Akira Yamoko was not there this year, which made me a little sad, so Togo was kind of the token Bomani artist that was there, but he wasn't doing any type of talks or anything like that so, that's all we know
10247236	10247556	DarkSakura
10273220	10274021	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
10296086	10301073	We're going to be launching a retro lunch program here on the station very soon.
10301093	10303376	We're going to play the greatest in 8 and 16-bit music.
10303456	10304838	I have all the 8-bit music done.
10304898	10307121	I just need to get the 16-bit music done, and then we're ready to go.
10307502	10309084	So, all right.
10310806	10311387	Moving on.
10312566	10317327	Let's see, GameBoyGuy13 wanted a clarification on that site where we could vote.
10318287	10321088	That was PodcastAwards.com.
10321408	10326529	Although also, if you want to be so kind, PodcastAlley.com has a voting system, A-L-L-E-Y.com.
10327369	10332190	And the more people that vote for us there, just do a search for Orange Lounge, the higher ranked we are and the more attention we get.
10332250	10335671	And again, we here at Orange Lounge Radio, we like attention.
10338370	10339131	Um, let's see.
10339231	10343413	Socorino wants to know, what do you think the next 2DX style will be called?
10344213	10348256	Since there is, you know, Happy Sky, 2DX Red, what do you think the next one will be called?
10352158	10352618	2DX 13.
10356900	10357901	Just 13.
10360082	10360402	Alright.
10362544	10363144	Um, let's see.
10364225	10370347	DarkLionXVI, also known as Siggy, just wanted to point out that I mispronounced K-K-K because I just like saying it that way.
10370367	10371447	It's actually K-Chak.
10372187	10372747	Sorry.
10375488	10378729	JammerJ wants to know... Oh, I'm sorry.
10378749	10379549	That was a request.
10379669	10380149	My bad.
10380669	10381230	Not a question.
10381530	10381830	Whoops.
10382470	10382530	Oh.
10383446	10387230	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
10400663	10401203	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
10432162	10432582	And that's it.
10432622	10434102	That's all the questions we've gotten so far.
10435303	10437283	So I guess that's it for Ask Orange Lounge.
10438784	10439644	I guess so.
10440004	10442364	We're reading some other things in the chat room there.
10444105	10444605	Let's see.
10447606	10449766	2DX Violet is a suggestion there.
10449986	10451186	2DX X2.
10453907	10456148	And then they're back to talking about Harry Potter, so go figure.
10456768	10457628	I just, I couldn't.
10458092	10459513	Get into the Harry Potter books.
10459593	10460494	I have RDD.
10460554	10461835	I have Reading Deficit Disorder.
10464217	10465558	I can't read the big books.
10465938	10466599	I don't know why.
10466739	10467219	I try.
10468380	10470582	But the weird thing is I used to when I was a kid all the time.
10470982	10472323	I used to read Judy Blume.
10472804	10473544	I used to read R.L.
10474065	10474605	Stine.
10475005	10476286	The Ramona Quimby books.
10476446	10477447	Come on, those things were the shit.
10477607	10478608	Don't roll your eyes at me!
10479889	10482011	I can roll my eyes at whoever I want to!
10482191	10483472	Ramona was the shit.
10495755	10499357	Reznor wants to know, what is your favorite Magical Drop 3 character?
10500437	10502999	You know, actually, most of the Magical Drop I played was number 2.
10503179	10504179	I didn't really play number 3.
10504579	10505440	I didn't know there was a...
10506263	10507043	for number three yet.
10507083	10508864	So I haven't really played much of three, just two.
10509344	10511925	So I don't really know the characters that well.
10511965	10512405	I'm sorry.
10512465	10513405	I just play it.
10516306	10519627	And Rini wants to know pancakes or waffles?
10521087	10521447	Waffles.
10522087	10522467	Waffles.
10522607	10522928	Neither.
10523528	10524408	Belgium waffles.
10524928	10526188	Waffle House waffles.
10526468	10529149	The peanut butter and banana waffle from the country, what was that?
10529189	10529869	Country waffles?
10530270	10531030	Not Waffle House.
10531110	10532230	We don't have those here.
10532250	10532810	Country waffles.
10532870	10533170	Yeah.
10533490	10535671	That is the banana and peanut butter or the
10536980	10537280	Love it!
10538960	10539221	Alright.
10540221	10543802	Anyway, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
10547002	10551143	Thank you for listening and tuning in to us and listening to our show and our rants and our raves.
10551744	10554184	Now it's time to go around and get everybody's final thought.
10554824	10555965	Loki, your final thought tonight.
10556765	10560126	My final thought is this week's going to suck.
10561406	10561666	Why?
10561686	10561746	Why?
10562367	10565130	Reject false icons and people stop getting in my way of me reading the book.
10587229	10590611	My final thought is I'm going to go play with my new television.
10590631	10592632	I want to go play Xbox really big.
10592913	10593273	Can't wait.
10593913	10594394	And 2DX.
10594494	10595674	I'm still playing 2DX tonight.
10595914	10597175	I played Guitar Man on mine.
10597636	10598056	How was that?
10599637	10601938	50 inches of Guitar Man goodness.
10602498	10603899	I actually have a widescreen TV.
10603979	10607341	You have to set your PlayStation option to the widescreen.
10607842	10608382	I won't forget.
10608762	10610964	Because it'll look kind of funky if you just do it on TV.
10611024	10613305	No, but I'm going to play 2DX widescreen and I'm going to probably...
10615635	10616855	Spill beer in my pants.
10617496	10619596	You can also do Ultramix in widescreen.
10619836	10621317	I don't think Ultramix supports HD.
10621457	10622077	That made me sad.
10622657	10623218	I looked on the back.
10623238	10623858	It doesn't support HD.
10623878	10631540	But the thing is that for the PS2, you have an option in your menu to change the graphic option.
10631840	10632240	Can't wait.
10633161	10633501	Can't wait.
10634461	10634761	All right.
10635782	10637022	Final word of the show.
10637262	10639923	One word to sum the whole damn thing up for everybody.
10640464	10642565	Happy episode 150, you guys, by the way.
10643985	10644706	Congratulations.
10645226	10645646	Yay.
10645706	10646726	I think this should be the last one.
10646926	10647347	Let's finish.
10647567	10647887	We're done.
10648007	10648287	Bye.
10649728	10653829	No, we'll be back next week with episode 151, and then we're going on vacation for a little while.
10655290	10659491	At least I am, so I think that means we all are, unless one of you guys is going to be doing a show for your house.
10659551	10659851	I don't know.
10659931	10660272	We'll see.
10660532	10661332	We'll talk about that later.
10662412	10663793	Maybe we should do like a...
10664617	10666321	It's a countdown episode.
10666581	10667443	Countdown episode?
10667864	10669066	Can we just get on the air?
10669247	10670108	I'll work on it.
10670128	10670850	5, 4, 3, uh, uh, uh.
10670870	10670850	29! 28!
