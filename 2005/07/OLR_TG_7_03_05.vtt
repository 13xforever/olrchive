00:04.300 --> 00:14.000
You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Skye, and Logan.

00:19.000 --> 00:27.000
Hello, everybody, and welcome to another edition of our podcast, Your Home, dedicated to video games and video gaming.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
Most notably, the games that don't suck.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
Joining me as always, my awesome co-host,

00:34.000 --> 00:37.000
Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers. There she is.

00:37.000 --> 00:38.000
Cheerio, loves.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
How you doing, hon?

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
Um... recovering.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
Yeah, we'll talk about what's been going on here in a little bit.

00:45.000 --> 00:49.000
And in the other corner, the one and only Tech Masa Loki.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
Hey.

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
How you doing? Holding up okay?

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
As best as I can.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.280
OK, let me set this up for you guys

00:57.280 --> 00:59.080
out there who are listening.

00:59.080 --> 01:01.900
Right now, we're looking at the three year anniversary

01:01.900 --> 01:02.960
of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:02.960 --> 01:04.620
Now granted, we've only been podcasting

01:04.620 --> 01:06.520
for about the last four or five months,

01:06.520 --> 01:08.320
oh, since January, however long that's been.

01:08.320 --> 01:09.960
Well, actually, that would be like six or seven

01:09.960 --> 01:10.840
months at this point.

01:10.840 --> 01:12.680
So we've been podcasting a little while.

01:12.680 --> 01:15.360
But our station itself, the live station we have,

01:15.360 --> 01:16.720
has been up for three years now.

01:16.720 --> 01:18.520
We're celebrating that this weekend.

01:18.520 --> 01:20.360
And in honor of our three year show,

01:20.360 --> 01:23.860
tonight when we did our live program earlier this evening,

01:23.860 --> 01:28.460
We did a little bit of drinking, a little bit.

01:28.460 --> 01:30.900
So we're recovering from that right now,

01:30.900 --> 01:32.340
Loki more so than anybody,

01:32.340 --> 01:36.300
because he had a little experience with my toilet,

01:36.300 --> 01:37.260
needless to say.

01:37.260 --> 01:38.100
Let's just leave it at that.

01:38.100 --> 01:41.220
He was bowed down before the porcelain goddess.

01:41.220 --> 01:42.340
Exactly.

01:42.340 --> 01:44.080
Dark Soccer and I, we're fine.

01:44.080 --> 01:45.860
Remember kids, don't drink and drive.

01:45.860 --> 01:47.860
We're doing this because we have designated drivers.

01:47.860 --> 01:48.700
Don't drink and date.

01:48.700 --> 01:50.980
It's food rating, yes, don't drink and date.

01:50.980 --> 01:51.820
That's the special important thing.

01:51.820 --> 01:53.420
That might get you into a bit more trouble.

01:53.420 --> 01:56.180
However, drinking in DDR is okay.

01:56.180 --> 01:57.020
It's actually kinda funny.

01:57.020 --> 01:58.320
It's funny as hell.

01:58.320 --> 01:59.480
I've played DDR drunk.

01:59.480 --> 02:01.620
I did too, Vegas once, I remember.

02:01.620 --> 02:03.380
Of all places, I was playing DDR drunk.

02:03.380 --> 02:05.620
I just remember feeling very heavy.

02:05.620 --> 02:07.340
My choker's choking me.

02:07.340 --> 02:08.220
All right.

02:08.220 --> 02:11.420
Anyway, let's talk about our gaming weeks.

02:11.420 --> 02:12.780
Before we get into the gaming news

02:12.780 --> 02:13.620
here on Orange Laundry Radio,

02:13.620 --> 02:15.100
we always talk about our gaming weeks,

02:15.100 --> 02:17.220
starting off with the one and only Dark Sakura.

02:17.220 --> 02:18.320
I know you got your move done,

02:18.320 --> 02:19.980
so you got a chance to play any games this week?

02:19.980 --> 02:21.140
We did move.

02:21.140 --> 02:24.820
haven't played any games except the potato peeler on gorillas.com and of

02:24.820 --> 02:31.780
course widescreen pong so we did however purchase a 50 inch HD widescreen TV I

02:31.780 --> 02:35.100
was gonna say you have a sweet new gamer rig if nothing else as soon as we pick

02:35.100 --> 02:39.820
up some component cables I'm gonna be freaking trying out 2dx on that is that

02:39.820 --> 02:45.500
the first game you're gonna try on there is beat mania 2d yeah all right sounds

02:45.500 --> 02:50.340
good to me you got a sweet gaming rig it sounds like you have a better gaming rig

02:50.340 --> 02:52.940
than anybody else I know so we're definitely gonna have to go over there

02:52.940 --> 02:57.100
I'll have to do a podcast over there at some point on your sweet new 50-inch TV

02:57.100 --> 03:02.860
I actually added the laptop to it oh and we watched we tried to watch Tokyo

03:02.860 --> 03:08.320
breakfast and it wouldn't load so we watched the deadly Negro amazing what

03:08.320 --> 03:12.060
it what is that I don't even know it it's this guy who basically screams and

03:12.060 --> 03:17.660
yells motherfucker a whole lot pleasant a to Afro Nova oh but the second one is

03:17.660 --> 03:24.660
funny. Where can you get that from? Um, totallycracked.com. Sounds appropriate. Loki, you look a little

03:25.160 --> 03:30.920
dazed and confused right now, but can you tell us about your gaming week? Take it coherent.

03:30.920 --> 03:36.460
My gaming week is mainly, um, Destroy All Humans. That's pretty much all I've been playing

03:36.460 --> 03:45.460
this week. Um, I actually did finish the game itself. Um, it is pretty simplistic other

03:45.460 --> 03:51.820
than you know destroying all humans but um it's a lot of fun they have the voice

03:51.820 --> 03:57.100
actor that does invaders in it so you gotta love that and other than that

03:57.100 --> 04:02.380
it's a lot of fun so definitely check it out did you say you got to take a sneak

04:02.380 --> 04:11.060
peek at some new PSP game yeah I have a PSP I'm borrowing the PSP version of

04:11.060 --> 04:19.900
what was it it was um I know you're drunk but think think hard think hard

04:19.900 --> 04:29.900
no um honestly it's um doo doo doo doo doo I remember it's basically um it's a

04:29.900 --> 04:40.780
lot of fun it's um you remember what the name of the game is no but honestly it's

04:40.780 --> 04:49.500
It's, it's um, I don't even, alright forget it, there's some new PSP game that's coming

04:49.500 --> 04:50.500
out.

04:50.500 --> 04:51.500
I can't believe that.

04:51.500 --> 04:52.500
Dead to Rights.

04:52.500 --> 04:53.500
There you go, there you go, Dead to Rights.

04:53.500 --> 04:57.300
Dead to Rights, Dead to Rights Reckoning, and I've been playing that.

04:57.300 --> 05:01.700
It's basically like Dead to Rights 2, but it's for the PSP, you've got the dog, it's

05:01.700 --> 05:04.260
a lot of fun.

05:04.260 --> 05:07.740
Definitely check it out if you've got PSP, cause honestly there's not that much out right

05:07.740 --> 05:09.580
now, it's for the PSP, so.

05:09.580 --> 05:13.180
PSP is suffering from what DS was suffering from like four months ago.

05:13.180 --> 05:15.180
Yeah, exactly. PSP syndrome basically.

05:15.180 --> 05:17.380
Same thing as DS syndrome.

05:17.380 --> 05:21.080
You've got to pick up many games that are out there for the PSP right now.

05:21.080 --> 05:26.280
You've got Midnight Club 3 that just came out, and you know, Death of the Rites, Reckoning.

05:26.280 --> 05:27.880
You've got to check those out.

05:27.880 --> 05:33.280
And those are really good. Especially since you've got the bullet time effect and stuff in that.

05:33.280 --> 05:37.980
Isn't the bullet time effect kind of horrid in a lot of games now though? Ever since The Matrix?

05:37.980 --> 05:44.700
Yeah, I mean since the matrix is it still cool. That's what I want to know. Oh hell. Yeah, it's so cool

05:44.700 --> 05:46.740
Yeah, just check it out. It's a lot of fun

05:47.300 --> 05:54.820
Honestly, um, but if you really want to you know, save some money and stuff just download the Genesis emulators and whatnot and

05:55.740 --> 05:59.340
Play those because they don't cost anything. It's a lot of fun and

06:01.260 --> 06:06.340
Definitely if you're out there buying PSP games don't do it while you're drunk because

06:06.340 --> 06:11.180
obviously you're gonna be spending money on stuff that you shouldn't be spending

06:11.180 --> 06:16.260
money on take it from me okay cuz I'm you know is you drinking go shopping all

06:16.260 --> 06:20.540
the time I drink and go shopping yeah exactly and then you become summer you're

06:20.540 --> 06:26.260
like what the hell why did I buy this so honestly folks if you're drunk just you

06:26.260 --> 06:30.380
know seriously and just you know make your peace with the porcelain God and

06:30.380 --> 06:35.180
you know take it from there you're being a lethargic drunk tonight I think it's

06:35.180 --> 06:36.380
very interesting

06:36.380 --> 06:41.900
well i've already thrown up about four times over the you know the porcelain

06:41.900 --> 06:44.180
god as you would put it

06:44.180 --> 06:47.580
and uh... kneel down before the porcelain goddess

06:47.580 --> 06:53.940
i've never actually thrown up when i've been drunk so i've hit a whole new level of

06:53.940 --> 06:56.180
drunkenness

06:56.180 --> 07:00.780
uh... but take it from me though the the psp game version of um...

07:00.780 --> 07:05.420
The other rights is pretty cool, so I definitely recommend checking it out, but

07:05.420 --> 07:10.380
you know, honestly, you know, try it before you buy it. You know, don't go out and buy these PSP

07:10.380 --> 07:11.740
games because

07:11.740 --> 07:17.680
they're not that great. They're just, you know, ports of the PC, um, or PS2 versions of them.

07:17.680 --> 07:20.700
So just try them before you buy them, and then, um,

07:20.700 --> 07:22.460
go from there. Alright, sounds good.

07:22.460 --> 07:26.180
Now, my gaming week, I actually, I have been obsessed with the DS game all week

07:26.180 --> 07:32.060
along and it's Meteos I love Meteos I picked that up earlier this week this is

07:32.060 --> 07:36.780
what the DS is all about you guys because I the touchscreen adds so much

07:36.780 --> 07:40.780
to this game because it allows the game to be fast paced because you move your

07:40.780 --> 07:45.220
blocks literally with the stylus you can you can play this game with the

07:45.220 --> 07:49.380
controller and the button but it would not work having to swap the bricks one

07:49.380 --> 07:52.780
at a time it just would not work the same but having a stylus where you can

07:52.780 --> 07:56.060
drag your blocks up and down because the interesting thing about me yes you can't

07:56.060 --> 07:59.400
move them left and right. You only move your blocks up and down, which is kind of weird.

07:59.400 --> 08:03.040
It adds this whole new dimension to a puzzle game. I can't explain it, but it makes it

08:03.040 --> 08:09.320
very fast paced. Meteos is very cool. I love it because being kind of a short attention

08:09.320 --> 08:14.080
gamer or a gamer ADD, as I sometimes call it, or sometimes I only want to play a game

08:14.080 --> 08:19.040
for 5-10 minutes, Meteos works out really well for me. A lot of people have been comparing

08:19.040 --> 08:23.240
this game to Luminous. Well, of course, the same company, same developer. I would say

08:23.240 --> 08:27.880
The music and graphics aren't quite what they are in Luminous, but I think that's just a

08:27.880 --> 08:29.160
system holdback.

08:29.160 --> 08:32.920
I mean, obviously on the PSP, which is more CD-based, you're going to get better music

08:32.920 --> 08:36.400
and you get stuff like the Mondo Grosso track, Shinin', whatever.

08:36.400 --> 08:38.680
It works out better for that.

08:38.680 --> 08:44.120
But that's not to knock Meteos because it's an incredible concept for a game, and the

08:44.120 --> 08:48.480
type of game it is you could not do on the PSP because of the touchscreen and everything.

08:48.480 --> 08:51.800
Definitely if you're a DS owner, if you like puzzle games to any extent, if you went out

08:51.800 --> 08:56.480
bought puyo puyo fever or you buy any other puzzler pilarium man if you wasted

08:56.480 --> 09:00.200
the money on pilarium trust me you're gonna love medios it redeems DS puzzlers

09:00.200 --> 09:03.440
by quite a bit so I highly recommend it that's been the game I've been playing

09:03.440 --> 09:07.040
I'm still waiting for like your plankton I'm looking forward to electroplank and

09:07.040 --> 09:12.080
of course nintendogs so we'll see I got my puppies ordered real are you getting

09:12.080 --> 09:17.240
the u.s. or Japanese one the u.s. I know a lot of thinking get it at a 30% off

09:17.240 --> 09:21.940
discount all right all right let's get into some gaming news first off though

09:21.940 --> 09:26.180
just want to welcome those you guys that are subscribed to us through iTunes now

09:26.180 --> 09:32.240
because iTunes 4.9 rolled out earlier actually last week as you probably know

09:32.240 --> 09:35.560
about and a lot of folks find an orange lounge radio thanks to that doing a

09:35.560 --> 09:39.120
search for video games and finding us so big hello to you guys hope you enjoy the

09:39.120 --> 09:43.720
show just remember we're a little we're a little out of it tonight so this this

09:43.720 --> 09:51.080
This isn't quite representative of our normal perky cells, but darn it, we are giving you

09:51.080 --> 09:55.600
a podcast every week, come hell or high water, and I think this just proves it.

09:55.600 --> 09:56.600
Or lots of booze.

09:56.600 --> 09:57.600
Oh yeah.

09:57.600 --> 09:58.600
Or channel 11 shots.

09:58.600 --> 10:02.400
I still can't believe I out-drunk Loki, and I'm more sober.

10:02.400 --> 10:06.600
Alright, I was going to ask Loki, uh, Loki looks passed out now, I think he's actually

10:06.600 --> 10:10.560
fell asleep, I was going to ask you if anything's going on in the hack and crack scene, in a

10:10.560 --> 10:12.720
couple sentences, anything?

10:12.720 --> 10:18.960
the 1.5 version PSP stuff but that's when that was released last week then

10:18.960 --> 10:26.460
that really only thing to mention is the loader for the luminous is available for

10:26.460 --> 10:31.840
the PSP so that means you know there's gonna be more PSP games so they're

10:31.840 --> 10:35.520
actually running the ROMs for but that's kind of a gray area because that's

10:35.520 --> 10:40.280
piracy flat-out really yeah there's piracy but that's pretty much the big

10:40.280 --> 10:44.920
things going on the PSP world but if I'm not mistaken wouldn't these versions of

10:44.920 --> 10:48.500
luminous or whatever that you load on your memory car or memory stick when

10:48.500 --> 10:53.360
they have stripped graphics typically like a lot of them what was it Dreamcast

10:53.360 --> 10:55.760
when they were trying to put those on CDs they would sometimes have to strip

10:55.760 --> 10:59.120
out some of the audio and luminous if you strip out the audio and some of the

10:59.120 --> 11:02.640
graphics it's not going to be the same game the audience at the audio is

11:02.640 --> 11:06.320
essential to a game like Luma all I don't know if they're doing so far but

11:06.320 --> 11:10.580
But so far, the thing that's been stripped out is all the audio.

11:10.580 --> 11:15.180
So all the, like, you know, music stuff has gone, so.

11:15.180 --> 11:16.180
It's not worth it.

11:16.180 --> 11:19.800
You know, it's really not worth it, but it is a step in the right direction, I guess,

11:19.800 --> 11:22.240
with as far as pirating goes.

11:22.240 --> 11:26.440
But really, who cares about pirating games, I mean, because most of the games suck.

11:26.440 --> 11:32.880
But all you have to know is that I'm incredibly drunk right now, and that's really what counts.

11:32.880 --> 11:35.520
Somebody stripped the caffeine out of Loki or something.

11:35.520 --> 11:39.680
Honestly, folks, if I could feel better right now, that'd be great.

11:39.680 --> 11:42.320
Anything you could do to make me feel better, that'd be great.

11:42.320 --> 11:42.880
Remember, kids, don't break a drive.

11:42.880 --> 11:44.400
I'll pass off the penguin mints.

11:44.400 --> 11:44.900
All right.

11:46.960 --> 11:48.800
Well, since we got some increased exposure,

11:48.800 --> 11:52.120
we've actually been getting some letters on our mailbox, togo,

11:52.120 --> 11:55.000
T-O-G-O, at orangeloungeradio.com.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.240
And we thought we'd take a minute to read some letters.

12:01.000 --> 12:05.000
Yeah, let's open up the old Orange Lounge Radio letter bag.

12:05.000 --> 12:09.200
Let's see, the first email that we have comes from

12:09.200 --> 12:15.040
Sakurina wrote us an email saying that Sakurina was actually listening to one of our older

12:15.040 --> 12:21.120
podcasts, the May 9th, 2005 podcast, and had some comments about the banning of violent

12:21.120 --> 12:22.520
video games to minors.

12:22.520 --> 12:28.960
Sakurina says, I am a minor and my parents follow and keep up with the ESRB rating system.

12:28.960 --> 12:33.640
I've always kept up with the ESRB's rating system and I've followed it as much as possible.

12:33.640 --> 12:38.720
In fact, I've never really played a mature game until Halo in 2001 when I was 10, and

12:38.720 --> 12:42.880
I didn't find myself mature enough to play them, and I gave up on them until last year

12:42.880 --> 12:48.400
when I purchased Metal Gear Solid, the Twin Snakes, my first mature game I ever purchased.

12:48.400 --> 12:52.660
My parents actually ask me what I'm going to play, and they know how mature I am for

12:52.660 --> 12:53.660
each kind of game.

12:53.660 --> 12:56.240
In other words, not all parents are retards.

12:56.240 --> 13:02.320
Good for your parents, but my comments were strictly in reference to the majority.

13:02.320 --> 13:03.320
Yes.

13:03.320 --> 13:07.600
again not all parents are retards we want to just reinforce that there

13:07.600 --> 13:11.160
we there's some very intelligent parents out there and yours sound like that you

13:11.160 --> 13:13.960
sound like an intelligent individual as well because you know what's good for

13:13.960 --> 13:15.000
you and what's not

13:15.000 --> 13:18.760
and we applaud those gamers that know how to distinguish

13:18.760 --> 13:23.160
the gaming world from real life because they are people in Korea apparently

13:23.160 --> 13:26.200
yeah as that story we had last week alright

13:26.200 --> 13:30.560
let's go on to the second letter we got second letter we got was from

13:30.560 --> 13:32.460
Warrior Bob

13:32.460 --> 13:38.060
Warrior Bob was responding to something last week's show having to do with the ethical

13:38.580 --> 13:42.040
Ethical miss of emulated games at the Kalani ethicality

13:42.740 --> 13:45.060
Sorry, I need to go back to a grammar school

13:46.260 --> 13:50.300
Warrior Bob says I think I'm somewhere between all your fine selves

13:50.300 --> 13:57.740
I think it's perfectly okay to emulate something which is no longer easily available on the market out of print games like the pre

13:57.740 --> 14:02.860
32-bit catalog, Japanese games never released here, etc.

14:02.860 --> 14:06.300
In the case of the re-released Nintendo games, the situation has changed.

14:06.300 --> 14:10.240
Now these games like Zelda and Metroid are easily available on the market, but the price

14:10.240 --> 14:11.640
is somewhat questionable.

14:11.640 --> 14:16.620
I think the emulation is valid with these titles, so long as an original NES copy is

14:16.620 --> 14:17.620
owned.

14:17.620 --> 14:22.060
The fact that the titles are selling shows that there exists a market, and as Jamie pointed

14:22.060 --> 14:26.100
out, many people consider it worth the price to have a portable version of the game.

14:26.100 --> 14:30.300
I know I, myself, bought a copy of the GBA Zelda re-release.

14:30.300 --> 14:31.300
Mmm.

14:31.300 --> 14:36.300
So, of course, you know, there's something to be said about the added value of the convenience

14:36.300 --> 14:39.380
of having it in your GBA with all this complicated, emulated stuff.

14:39.380 --> 14:44.640
My whole thing is, even with the re-releases, I don't think that they're anywhere near the

14:44.640 --> 14:50.740
same as having the system hooked up to your TV, playing the original game on the original

14:50.740 --> 14:54.060
damn controller, which is why I own so many freakin' video game systems.

14:54.060 --> 14:57.180
all right well thank you guys for your letters again if you guys have any

14:57.180 --> 15:01.600
emails out there you can always send us an email to go at orange lounge radio

15:01.600 --> 15:05.100
calm all right let's get into some gaming news tonight we'll start it off

15:05.100 --> 15:10.760
actually talking about the GBA and the DS this is interesting because the

15:10.760 --> 15:18.280
website in 10 dojo is saying that 57,000 Nintendo DS's were sold in May to

15:18.280 --> 15:23.120
American consumers Sony however is reporting that a quarter of a million

15:23.120 --> 15:27.440
PSPs were shipped in the same month of course I don't know those stats to me

15:27.440 --> 15:31.420
seem a little uneven because you have to remember the PSP was released later than

15:31.420 --> 15:36.820
the DS so you know how many sold versus how many shipped that's true too I don't

15:36.820 --> 15:39.300
know so it doesn't really account for all that however this is what's

15:39.300 --> 15:45.340
interesting the GBA sold two hundred and thirty seven thousand units so it's out

15:45.340 --> 15:49.140
selling the DS which is interesting do you think that's just because it's

15:49.140 --> 15:52.620
cheaper, or people just aren't into the DS thing,

15:52.620 --> 15:53.860
what do you think's up with that?

15:53.860 --> 15:57.300
I think it has to do with both of those reasons, actually.

15:57.300 --> 15:59.540
And also keep in mind the way marketing works for them,

15:59.540 --> 16:03.880
at least in Japan, the DS is being sold as something

16:03.880 --> 16:08.040
for adults, older people, whereas the GBA is for all ages.

16:09.900 --> 16:12.460
And I have a feeling that their marketing is very similar

16:12.460 --> 16:15.040
here, except they are taking advantage of the younger

16:15.040 --> 16:15.880
market.

16:15.880 --> 16:18.640
But what I don't get is that the DS, in many ways,

16:18.640 --> 16:24.120
just like a GBA you can play your GBA games on the DS that's what I don't get

16:24.120 --> 16:32.040
I don't know I'm using my DS as my GBA as well so our buddies over in Europe

16:32.040 --> 16:36.600
there's a story being announced there that it the DS in Europe is sell has

16:36.600 --> 16:41.680
sold 1 million units and that since the portable launched there three months ago

16:41.680 --> 16:48.040
worldwide DS sales now at 6 million so it's taken off in Europe but you know

16:48.040 --> 16:52.240
the PSP they're they're cracking down on the importing of the PSP's before it's

16:52.240 --> 16:55.160
actually released out there and all this interesting stuff which should actually

16:55.160 --> 16:58.680
be coming up in the next month or so yeah very soon so you guys don't have to

16:58.680 --> 17:02.760
wait much longer for that let's talk about there was actually a lot of news

17:02.760 --> 17:05.880
this week about MTV which I think is very interesting

17:05.880 --> 17:14.140
m-t-a I know I know but MTV has formed their own MTV games unit MTV games is

17:14.140 --> 17:19.440
devoted to quote developing producing and promoting unique and creative gaming

17:19.440 --> 17:24.360
experiences that resonate with MTV's audience and this kind of falls in line

17:24.360 --> 17:27.400
with another article that's been floating around in the music game

17:27.400 --> 17:31.720
community saying that MTV is talking they want to get into the music games

17:31.720 --> 17:37.240
but I can't help but think haven't MTV put out games already to some extent

17:37.240 --> 17:40.000
like I remember there was a remote control generator game the music

17:40.000 --> 17:45.400
generator games the remote control games on Nintendo but I'm thinking okay the

17:45.400 --> 17:50.120
difference is is that those were games put out by other companies using the MTV

17:50.120 --> 17:56.440
license now MTV wants to do their own thing so what do you think is it gonna

17:56.440 --> 18:01.520
be commercially successful I mean let's face MTV huge marketing machine they

18:01.520 --> 18:06.760
could free advertising crap crap are you saying that just because you're getting

18:06.760 --> 18:10.440
older and jaded with MTV or do you truly believe there's something else here?

18:10.440 --> 18:12.920
There's gonna be stupid children that's gonna buy it though.

18:12.920 --> 18:20.600
MTV does not know how to market games, honestly. I mean they- I mean hello, look it's MTV a channel

18:20.600 --> 18:28.200
itself. It's supposed to be music- music on their channel. It's all just stupid reality TV shows.

18:28.200 --> 18:35.400
I mean hello. Road rules the game. Honestly folks, um, they might be able to market it as a game,

18:35.400 --> 18:37.080
but I

18:37.080 --> 18:42.420
Think it's gonna fail overall. That's way. I think it is. I thought this wasn't now

18:42.420 --> 18:46.780
This is another this is another announcement that was made this week regarding MTV

18:46.920 --> 18:50.580
MTV is actually going to partner up with midway games

18:51.080 --> 18:55.680
They're going to jointly or basically what's gonna happen. It's gonna it's like a partnership for marketing

18:55.680 --> 19:03.240
They're gonna jointly sell in-game advertising and collaborating on the soundtracks and things like that now get this midway has la rush

19:03.240 --> 19:07.200
right what they're gonna do is they're gonna take some branding from pimp my

19:07.200 --> 19:13.500
ride on MTV and incorporate that into LA rush good for them me as long as they

19:13.500 --> 19:18.440
get their game out there I mean whatever way they manage to do that that's good

19:18.440 --> 19:22.520
for them works out for Midway because they get free marketing basically

19:22.520 --> 19:28.280
honestly does that disgrace the LA rush rush brunch the rush franchise or no

19:28.280 --> 19:33.360
You know, honestly, LA Rush wasn't that good of a game to begin with, I mean, I'd rather

19:33.360 --> 19:39.080
see him pushing, you know, pin my ride aspect of that.

19:39.080 --> 19:41.560
It's really sad that that game really sucked.

19:41.560 --> 19:45.880
I mean, the problem is that- I don't mind LA Rush, it's alright.

19:45.880 --> 19:46.880
It was okay!

19:46.880 --> 19:49.760
I enjoyed, like, Hydro Thunder and Arctic Thunder, those were my midway games.

19:49.760 --> 19:50.760
It was okay!

19:50.760 --> 19:53.240
The problem was, it lost all the aspects of the Rush series.

19:53.240 --> 19:58.060
I mean the rest series is basically like okay, you have like, you know set track that you go to

19:58.060 --> 20:02.740
There's a few shortcuts and one line and there's some really cool, you know shortcuts

20:02.740 --> 20:06.560
You can take that and you know involved like a lot of big jumps and one loops

20:07.400 --> 20:11.980
But this new game, it's just like, you know, you don't really know where you're supposed to go

20:11.980 --> 20:17.140
You just kind of follow a track and that's it. It wasn't as good as the original

20:18.260 --> 20:20.860
All right, a dark Sakura any thoughts on this

20:20.860 --> 20:25.860
It wasn't cool since Rush the Rock.

20:25.860 --> 20:30.860
Alright, everybody has their own opinion. I'm sure you guys at home have yours as well.

20:30.860 --> 20:35.860
Now we're going to get into the part of the show where we are going to better your life.

20:35.860 --> 20:38.860
Because you know what? We can't play video games all day long.

20:38.860 --> 20:39.860
Yes we can.

20:39.860 --> 20:45.860
But if we stayed home and played video games all day long, we'd have no time to go out and drink responsibly.

20:45.860 --> 20:48.860
Either that or we would let our four year old babies die.

20:48.860 --> 20:55.280
yes so in order to help better your life we're here to offer you some advice to

20:55.280 --> 20:58.340
help better your life in many ways and who better to bring that advice to you

20:58.340 --> 21:03.340
than dark Sakura with her advice column

21:03.780 --> 21:10.180
today's bit of advice is how to survive a fall onto subway tracks number one do

21:10.180 --> 21:13.540
not attempt to climb back onto the platform unless you are positive you

21:13.540 --> 21:18.840
have enough time to do so to find a safe place to stand out of the way of the

21:18.840 --> 21:20.880
noncoming train.

21:20.880 --> 21:27.140
Stand against a wall between columns separating two tracks on an adjoining set of tracks or

21:27.140 --> 21:29.180
beneath the platform.

21:29.180 --> 21:30.180
4.

21:30.180 --> 21:34.660
Remove any articles of clothing or bags that could catch on the train and stand still,

21:34.660 --> 21:35.660
straight, and tall.

21:35.660 --> 21:37.540
Wait, I don't think that you're not supposed to jump on the platform.

21:37.540 --> 21:38.540
What do you do?

21:38.540 --> 21:41.780
You jump on the other tracks where the train isn't coming and hope you're right?

21:41.780 --> 21:46.320
There's a middle section that has the pillars that hold the area up between where the alternating

21:46.320 --> 21:47.440
tracks are.

21:47.440 --> 21:48.820
Not every subway system.

21:48.820 --> 21:52.820
every but there are many that do because I'm thinking about Bart Bart doesn't

21:52.820 --> 21:56.460
have okay the picture you have shows okay I understand that but like Bart

21:56.460 --> 22:00.300
doesn't have that so if I fall on the tracks on Bart I'm dead basically is

22:00.300 --> 22:03.760
what you're saying yeah okay unless you can get your ass up all right so my

22:03.760 --> 22:13.900
final piece of advice yes don't fucking ride the subway to hail a taxi but

22:13.900 --> 22:17.460
subways are our New York friends can benefit from this piece of advice how

22:17.460 --> 22:18.700
How about this?

22:18.700 --> 22:21.860
Don't cross the yellow line, kids.

22:21.860 --> 22:26.020
Each knee, each knee, Suicide Club, yo.

22:26.020 --> 22:29.100
If you got that reference, hats off to you.

22:29.100 --> 22:30.460
Da, da, da.

22:30.460 --> 22:31.660
Big news this week.

22:31.660 --> 22:36.340
It doesn't quite affect video gaming, per se.

22:36.340 --> 22:38.880
But we know a lot of you guys are tech oriented,

22:38.880 --> 22:40.540
and a lot of you guys probably do this.

22:40.540 --> 22:42.120
You probably just don't talk about it.

22:42.120 --> 22:44.420
But peer-to-peer networks.

22:44.420 --> 22:47.020
There was this big Supreme Court ruling this week

22:47.020 --> 22:50.340
that said Grokster and Streamcast Networks,

22:50.340 --> 22:54.400
two big peer-to-peer services, could be held liable

22:54.400 --> 22:56.500
for the actions of users utilizing

22:56.500 --> 22:59.780
their peer-to-peer file sharing services.

22:59.780 --> 23:02.380
I'm sure a lot of you guys have heard a lot about this story.

23:02.380 --> 23:03.820
I'm curious what you guys think.

23:03.820 --> 23:05.180
DarkSakura, what do you think about this,

23:05.180 --> 23:07.260
this peer-to-peer ruling?

23:07.260 --> 23:08.300
Do you think this is fair,

23:08.300 --> 23:09.800
that Grokster should be held responsible

23:09.800 --> 23:11.300
for what its users do with it?

23:11.300 --> 23:19.360
Ultimately, they are providing the means, so legally, the service that provides the

23:19.360 --> 23:25.740
means for the illegal activity has a right of responsibility.

23:25.740 --> 23:30.740
They do have, they would basically be found negligent for allowing the misuse of their

23:30.740 --> 23:31.740
material.

23:31.740 --> 23:38.340
However, there is not a way to regulate this, which again, in the eyes of the court, would

23:38.340 --> 23:45.340
B, you shouldn't offer this service, you know, don't operate your business, but again, that

23:45.340 --> 23:49.640
takes money out of their pocket, you know, which, taking money out of the pocket of a

23:49.640 --> 23:56.080
small business eventually will hurt the economy, therefore, they're basically treading on some

23:56.080 --> 23:59.200
thin ice right here, the courts and the company.

23:59.200 --> 24:06.200
So the courts probably looking at this as a way to hold them responsible as a party

24:06.200 --> 24:09.240
while maintaining balance and industry.

24:10.200 --> 24:12.480
I mean, if that makes sense to you.

24:12.480 --> 24:13.880
Okay, okay, I'll follow you.

24:13.880 --> 24:16.200
Again, I'm coming from having taken

24:16.200 --> 24:17.600
that business law class.

24:17.600 --> 24:18.840
All right, all right.

24:18.840 --> 24:21.960
All right, moving on, my thoughts on this whole thing.

24:21.960 --> 24:24.860
I think it really depends on how you're marketing

24:24.860 --> 24:26.440
your peer-to-peer network.

24:26.440 --> 24:29.120
I think if you're marketing your peer-to-peer network

24:29.120 --> 24:31.900
as, you know, hey, come to our network

24:31.900 --> 24:34.780
and trade your illegal MP3 files on our network,

24:34.780 --> 24:37.760
then yes, I think you can be held responsible,

24:37.760 --> 24:40.320
but I think if you're marketing your network

24:40.320 --> 24:45.320
not as something that should be used for legit purposes,

24:45.960 --> 24:48.900
the trading of open source programs or what have you,

24:48.900 --> 24:51.120
and this is what you're encouraging your users to do

24:51.120 --> 24:55.060
and you're discouraging your users via warnings

24:55.060 --> 24:58.080
and other mechanisms to do the illegal thing,

24:58.080 --> 25:00.240
then I don't see how they can hold you so responsible.

25:00.240 --> 25:01.260
I kind of use this example.

25:01.260 --> 25:03.840
It's like household cleaner.

25:03.840 --> 25:07.440
You can't sue the people that make household cleaner

25:07.440 --> 25:10.720
because you could theoretically kill someone with it

25:10.720 --> 25:12.200
because they put warnings on the bottle that says,

25:12.200 --> 25:14.960
hey, don't swallow this, dumb ass, right?

25:14.960 --> 25:17.880
Actually, I have a case that I can repeat,

25:17.880 --> 25:19.000
an Oklahoma case.

25:19.000 --> 25:20.300
Okay.

25:20.300 --> 25:23.920
The weed eater has a warning on it that says,

25:23.920 --> 25:27.000
do not allow people under the age of,

25:27.000 --> 25:30.800
believe that it was 15 years old,

25:30.800 --> 25:34.640
within 20 feet of this machine while being operated.

25:34.640 --> 25:38.800
Um, in this case, an uncle was weed eating the lawn.

25:38.800 --> 25:42.120
The thing was fully on the machine.

25:42.120 --> 25:46.400
Ten-year-old kids picking up dirt after it. The uncle,

25:46.400 --> 25:50.880
the mom's, like, off doing something else. She's there but not observing her child.

25:50.880 --> 25:55.840
The guy hits a rock with the weed eater, and this is the one with the metal blades.

25:55.840 --> 26:00.700
It recoils goes backwards and slices off the child's arm at the elbow

26:01.900 --> 26:03.900
now

26:04.140 --> 26:08.700
We are looking at this as logical adults, who do you think would be a fault?

26:11.860 --> 26:13.580
Cool adult

26:13.580 --> 26:17.660
Would it be the uncle for his negligence? It would be the weed eater company

26:17.660 --> 26:21.640
I think a bit child because they're down right the white, you know

26:21.640 --> 26:25.900
I think it is in common sense it falls in one of those categories of accidents happen

26:25.900 --> 26:30.540
You know just like it's like a car accidents happen. It's it's unfortunate, but it was an accident

26:30.540 --> 26:34.860
I don't think anybody's liable in that case. That's what I that's my opinion is logical in the state of, Oklahoma

26:34.940 --> 26:38.760
There are three cases for a company to be held liable for negligence

26:39.160 --> 26:45.240
That's for default of the machine accident caused by said default to misuse of the of the item

26:45.520 --> 26:49.280
The company was actually found at fault for Wow a default

26:49.280 --> 26:57.120
But what a machine did not have. Now, taking that example, that poison notice on the bottle

26:57.120 --> 27:02.920
of bleach isn't going to mean shit. Unless it is proven that the child swallowed the

27:02.920 --> 27:09.040
item while the parent was negligent. And then it is the parent's fault. However, again.

27:09.040 --> 27:13.200
Well, okay, tying this back to the peer-to-peer network thing before we lose too many people

27:13.200 --> 27:15.040
in our analogies. Well, yeah, but I'm using it as-

27:15.040 --> 27:22.340
No, I understand, I understand. But no, the MPAA or the RIAA is not going to, well I guess

27:22.340 --> 27:26.880
they have been suing the individual users to some extent, but having very limited success

27:26.880 --> 27:30.640
in doing so, and it's bad, bad PR for them too.

27:30.640 --> 27:39.120
Oh yeah. Now, the way that this ties into the peer-to-peer. Peer-to-peer offers a service.

27:39.120 --> 27:44.320
They do have the disclaimers on there that this is not to be used for X purposes, right?

27:44.320 --> 27:51.320
of them. It depends on the network. Even those that have that notice on there, if their product

27:51.600 --> 27:58.600
is being quote misused, they're still responsible. In the eyes of the court, they should still

27:58.700 --> 28:04.520
be responsible. Now again, logically that doesn't make sense. Logically it should be

28:04.520 --> 28:10.560
in the hands of the person who is misusing the product as long as the disclaimer exists.

28:10.560 --> 28:14.720
Now another thing too is that when they download that service, thereís usually, and Iíve

28:14.720 --> 28:17.540
studied this, thereís a click agreement.

28:17.540 --> 28:22.320
By clicking that little box that says you agree to their terms of service, you are signing

28:22.320 --> 28:26.680
a contract that says I will not misuse this item.

28:26.680 --> 28:30.320
I will not do this for anything other than the specific purpose intended.

28:30.320 --> 28:33.760
So even after all that, the companies could still be held liable?

28:33.760 --> 28:39.640
I don't, I don't, if they are in the case that they have that as a full part of their

28:39.640 --> 28:46.420
agreement and the parties violating the cert, violating that terms of service are, you know,

28:46.420 --> 28:50.880
have placed that agreement, they're using their product and that clause exists, I do

28:50.880 --> 28:52.660
not believe the company should be held liable.

28:52.660 --> 28:53.880
They put it in there.

28:53.880 --> 29:01.400
It is the point of the user at that point of violating terms of service, which removes

29:01.400 --> 29:03.060
negligence from the company.

29:03.060 --> 29:07.940
Here's the reality how many people read that notice no it does nobody well maybe five people

29:07.940 --> 29:13.140
five percent of the users of it maybe still how many people buy a house and don't read

29:13.140 --> 29:18.240
their mortgage true i you know i work in a mortgage company how many freaking calls did

29:18.240 --> 29:23.780
i get when i was in customer service why do i have a pre-payment penalty well didn't you

29:23.780 --> 29:30.360
read your contract you had three days to change your fucking mind again pardon me for my rudeness

29:30.360 --> 29:37.540
on that, but you people need to freaking read. You sign a contract, you need to read it,

29:37.540 --> 29:42.960
and I think that in the case of those peer-to-peer networks, I think that they shouldn't be held

29:42.960 --> 29:47.560
at fault at all. However, those who are too stupid to put that clause in there, oh yeah,

29:47.560 --> 29:48.560
nail them. Seriously.

29:48.560 --> 29:52.640
All right, many, many different perspectives on this issue, very hot button issue in the

29:52.640 --> 29:54.280
community. If you have thoughts, we'd love to hear them.

29:54.280 --> 29:58.660
Yeah, and I'm sorry for going off on the legal aspect of it. That's something that really

29:58.660 --> 29:59.660
I research.

29:59.660 --> 30:04.100
want people to think about the different perspectives of looking at it. A lot of people are just

30:04.100 --> 30:07.980
stomping their foot going, that's not fair, I want to keep downloading music for free,

30:07.980 --> 30:12.820
it's not fair. But you have to look at, in the case of this, you have to really look

30:12.820 --> 30:18.180
at the big picture to understand what's going on. And you know, the average gamer, I don't

30:18.180 --> 30:23.900
think is going to do that. The average gamer is probably going to be, you know, what, teenage,

30:23.900 --> 30:27.740
lower 20s, the average gamer.

30:27.740 --> 30:30.960
To hugely generalize, yes. But they're not going to be

30:30.960 --> 30:35.240
in the age group that is known for thinking about this type of thing.

30:35.240 --> 30:39.280
You know, but if you're going to have an opinion,

30:39.280 --> 30:43.120
it's a good idea to have an informed opinion as opposed to

30:43.120 --> 30:47.400
stomping your foot and acting like an ignorant little child.

30:47.400 --> 30:51.800
Sorry is the truth. And we're here to help educate you and think about the different positions.

30:51.800 --> 30:52.640
about this proposition.

30:52.640 --> 30:53.460
Exactly, exactly.

30:53.460 --> 30:54.300
All right.

30:54.300 --> 30:55.140
Let's move on.

30:55.140 --> 30:55.960
We lost Loki.

30:55.960 --> 30:56.800
No, that's all right.

30:56.800 --> 30:58.340
Did Loki pass out finally?

30:58.340 --> 30:59.180
No.

30:59.180 --> 31:00.000
You still with us, Loki?

31:00.000 --> 31:00.840
No.

31:00.840 --> 31:02.260
All right, he's still there a little bit.

31:02.260 --> 31:03.660
All right, Loki, do you have a thought

31:03.660 --> 31:04.500
on the peer-to-peer thing?

31:04.500 --> 31:06.180
Can you get your microphone back up there?

31:06.180 --> 31:09.140
We were going to get the opinion of the average drunk.

31:09.140 --> 31:10.780
What are we talking about now?

31:10.780 --> 31:12.420
Exactly.

31:12.420 --> 31:16.140
Peer-to-peer network, Scott, said you can be held liable.

31:16.140 --> 31:18.540
The Supreme Court says you, Grokster, can be held liable

31:18.540 --> 31:19.780
because people misuse your service.

31:19.780 --> 31:21.140
I've never heard of Grokster.

31:21.140 --> 31:27.580
My thought is, you know what, honestly those peer-to-peer networks, they know that there's

31:27.580 --> 31:30.900
illegal files being shared on there.

31:30.900 --> 31:34.620
They're just doing the best they can to, you know, cover their asses.

31:34.620 --> 31:41.860
So honestly, um, you don't need to go through, go through to find all the files that you're

31:41.860 --> 31:43.620
looking for, so.

31:43.620 --> 31:48.680
So you are bringing up this point that a lot of people say, when you squelch one problem,

31:48.680 --> 31:49.680
it just gets bigger.

31:49.680 --> 31:52.800
If they had never shut down Napster,

31:52.800 --> 31:54.680
iTunes probably would be a lot more,

31:54.680 --> 31:56.720
even though iTunes is having a lot of success now,

31:56.720 --> 31:58.600
iTunes would probably be more successful

31:58.600 --> 32:01.000
if it had showed up before they shut down Napster,

32:01.000 --> 32:03.580
because people would have went from Napster to iTunes.

32:03.580 --> 32:05.720
Instead, people went from Napster to,

32:05.720 --> 32:07.280
well actually, and I take that back,

32:07.280 --> 32:10.600
iTunes did exist in some form on the Mac only though,

32:10.600 --> 32:14.360
but let's, you know, Mac only has a smaller share than PC.

32:14.360 --> 32:18.880
I went from Napster to, what was that, music?

32:18.880 --> 32:24.600
Audio grab or audio audio galaxy. I went to audio galaxy. Some people went to limewire Nutella

32:24.600 --> 32:26.580
There was a lot from from that

32:26.580 --> 32:33.560
I went to kaza and now I'm on the torrent and the problems getting worse and worse and I by the way am downloading files

32:33.840 --> 32:38.220
Illegally, you know and if you come try to search through my computer Oh government

32:38.220 --> 32:42.480
I'm going to fucking nail your ass to the goddamn wall and get you a fucking painting for

32:43.060 --> 32:46.360
violation of privacy, uh-uh and violating my

32:46.360 --> 32:50.600
I meant my rights under the Constitution.

32:50.600 --> 32:53.000
Oh yeah, I'm gonna nail you if you pull that shit on me.

32:53.000 --> 32:55.260
You do know anyone can listen to this podcast, right?

32:55.260 --> 32:56.100
Oh, I don't care.

32:56.100 --> 32:56.940
TwoGo at Orange Laundry.

32:56.940 --> 32:57.840
They do it.

32:57.840 --> 32:58.680
If you wanna send Jamie some fan mail.

32:58.680 --> 33:01.720
We are on unregulated freaking radio.

33:01.720 --> 33:02.680
I will nail you.

33:03.760 --> 33:06.200
Wow, them's fighting words.

33:06.200 --> 33:07.020
I don't care.

33:07.020 --> 33:07.860
All right.

33:09.940 --> 33:11.840
The BBC is running a story.

33:11.840 --> 33:14.480
This story actually being linked from Slashdie.

33:14.480 --> 33:15.720
Well, this is interesting.

33:15.720 --> 33:20.680
BBC is running a story saying that women are going to explode onto the gaming scene any

33:20.680 --> 33:22.120
minute now.

33:22.120 --> 33:28.560
I just exploded on the gaming scene.

33:28.560 --> 33:30.620
By the way, I'm not really downloading illegal files.

33:30.620 --> 33:35.160
You can pretty much figure where the rest of this story is going, saying that online

33:35.160 --> 33:41.720
role-playing games are doing good with women despite the subject matter, da-da-da.

33:41.720 --> 33:49.080
Gaming gamers in the UK make up a quarter of the gaming population, 39% in the US, 69%

33:49.080 --> 33:50.920
in South Korea.

33:50.920 --> 33:52.400
Very interesting.

33:52.400 --> 34:00.000
So I don't know, Dark Sakura as a woman gamer, what do you think?

34:00.000 --> 34:06.800
You know, I don't think it should matter, because that's just promoting discrimination

34:06.800 --> 34:08.600
between genders.

34:08.600 --> 34:18.760
I game, yes, I enjoy my Phantasy Star Online, I've been a week without it, but it doesn't

34:18.760 --> 34:19.760
matter.

34:19.760 --> 34:25.680
Why is there a stupid report about this freaking bullcrap when...

34:25.680 --> 34:28.680
Because a lot of horny guys out there would have been gaming away.

34:28.680 --> 34:34.200
Because you're like, oh my god, girls play video games, what does the freaking 21st century

34:34.200 --> 34:37.120
get with the times, it doesn't need a study.

34:37.120 --> 34:39.240
There were girls that played Atari.

34:39.240 --> 34:40.080
Hello.

34:40.080 --> 34:41.600
I played Atari, hello.

34:41.600 --> 34:45.220
But admittedly, not as many women play games as guys.

34:45.220 --> 34:46.760
Well, that needs to freaking change,

34:46.760 --> 34:49.640
but you don't need a report to tell you this.

34:49.640 --> 34:50.600
So what do they need to do?

34:50.600 --> 34:51.440
Really quickly, what do they need to do?

34:51.440 --> 34:53.920
They need to turn off their Xbox

34:53.920 --> 34:55.760
and go out and meet people.

34:55.760 --> 34:56.600
No, no, no, I'm not talking about that.

34:56.600 --> 34:57.420
Get laid.

34:57.420 --> 35:00.160
How do you get more women in games?

35:00.160 --> 35:01.560
Is it the type of games they're putting out?

35:01.560 --> 35:03.040
Is it the way they market them?

35:03.040 --> 35:05.560
Is it just society stigma?

35:05.560 --> 35:11.920
think the average woman interest is ridiculous. They need, like, Cosmo the game.

35:11.920 --> 35:17.280
So Paris Hilton needs to put out a video game. I guess. You know, how to be a social whore.

35:17.280 --> 35:20.740
But the rest of... no gamer would ever take a game like that seriously. Just like Mary

35:20.740 --> 35:24.640
Kate and Ashley learned to drive or whatever, Sweet Sixteen are the laughing stock of the

35:24.640 --> 35:28.520
gaming world. Yeah. Well, the thing is that I play freakin'

35:28.520 --> 35:31.380
ragnarok and ragnarok's cutesy

35:31.380 --> 35:34.840
but i played you know final fantasy eleven i played

35:34.840 --> 35:37.080
you know fantasy star online

35:37.080 --> 35:40.480
i played halo until i found out it made me motion sick

35:40.480 --> 35:44.400
you know my favorite game of all time is freaking guardian legend

35:44.400 --> 35:48.900
which is one of the one of the single hardest of video games ever

35:48.900 --> 35:49.880
you know

35:49.880 --> 35:52.060
i played abadox

35:52.060 --> 35:55.480
which was supposed to be the most gory video game when it came out

35:55.480 --> 35:56.680
you're too special though

35:56.680 --> 35:57.640
That's what it boils down to.

35:57.640 --> 36:01.040
I am a true gamer woman.

36:01.040 --> 36:03.080
I feel sorry, though, for other women

36:03.080 --> 36:07.200
to have me as the voice of the gaming community.

36:07.200 --> 36:09.080
I like the violent stuff.

36:09.080 --> 36:09.760
All right.

36:09.760 --> 36:11.320
Who's the game?

36:11.320 --> 36:13.000
Couple more stories here, you guys.

36:13.000 --> 36:16.280
PlayStation 3 will not be coming out with a hard drive.

36:16.280 --> 36:18.080
Xbox 360, they are saying they're

36:18.080 --> 36:19.560
going to do a 20 gig hard drive.

36:19.560 --> 36:21.240
PlayStation 3, nope.

36:21.240 --> 36:22.280
Not coming with it.

36:22.280 --> 36:25.840
There will be a slot where you can put in an 80 gig hard drive

36:25.840 --> 36:26.620
a little later on.

36:26.620 --> 36:28.380
but no hard drive in the outset.

36:28.380 --> 36:30.980
To me, this is kind of striking me as these stories

36:30.980 --> 36:32.500
are really kind of a bigger deal

36:32.500 --> 36:34.620
than I think they ought to be.

36:34.620 --> 36:36.220
I think it just really depends on the games

36:36.220 --> 36:37.740
that are coming out.

36:37.740 --> 36:41.140
If the games come out and they don't require a hard drive,

36:41.140 --> 36:42.700
because none of the games they have out right now

36:42.700 --> 36:45.380
really require a hard drive console-wise,

36:45.380 --> 36:48.580
save maybe Final Fantasy XI, a couple other exceptions,

36:49.880 --> 36:51.020
that's all you need.

36:51.020 --> 36:53.020
That's all the gaming system needs to be successful

36:53.020 --> 36:55.820
are good games, right?

36:55.820 --> 36:57.860
It really should only be the games that matter.

36:57.860 --> 37:00.620
But this story's been running on every gaming website, and it's kind of like,

37:00.620 --> 37:03.960
oh no, PlayStation 3, you're not going to have a hard drive.

37:03.960 --> 37:05.460
So?

37:05.460 --> 37:08.820
We didn't have a hard drive before the PS2.

37:08.820 --> 37:11.220
Why does it matter?

37:11.220 --> 37:11.980
Don't know.

37:11.980 --> 37:13.300
Yeah, the memory card.

37:13.300 --> 37:14.700
I think it's interesting.

37:14.700 --> 37:20.340
The only good that my hard drive is for is for my HD loader.

37:20.340 --> 37:22.460
And I only use it for that.

37:22.460 --> 37:27.260
And really, the only other reason to have that is for, like, what, the Endless Mode in Beatmania?

37:27.260 --> 37:30.660
And for, uh, Final Fantasy XI.

37:30.660 --> 37:31.160
Hm.

37:31.160 --> 37:32.160
That's it.

37:34.160 --> 37:42.460
Another news story, uh, a recent blog updated by a Japanese voice actor, Koji Tsujitani.

37:42.460 --> 37:48.460
Uh, he is a video game voice actor, and he contributed to Xenosaga, and he said in his blog,

37:48.460 --> 37:49.840
I'm doing another one.

37:49.840 --> 37:53.640
So he kind of let the cat out of the bag that there was a Xenosaga 3 on the way.

37:53.640 --> 37:55.160
I think we kind of figured that.

37:55.160 --> 37:56.800
Yeah, I think we kind of figured that.

37:56.800 --> 38:01.680
Namco, by the way, not making any official statement on that, but in the blog it says

38:01.680 --> 38:06.300
he has begun recording work for the next installment in the series.

38:06.300 --> 38:09.880
Kind of not a big surprise, but I'm sure a lot of fans will be happy to know that yes,

38:09.880 --> 38:12.320
it is indeed happening.

38:12.320 --> 38:18.520
lastly tonight a story about a gaming company called left-behind games you

38:18.520 --> 38:23.440
might know the term left-behind it's a famous book series that's big in the

38:23.440 --> 38:28.680
Christian and religious world it's a it's about what happened after the

38:28.680 --> 38:32.160
rapture basically and those folks that were left behind after the rapture yeah

38:32.160 --> 38:40.480
burning hell well get this they are they're making a PC game based on those

38:40.480 --> 38:42.880
novels

38:42.880 --> 38:46.120
that's right i i don't know how that's going to work

38:46.120 --> 38:50.880
but it seems like now now a lot of sites out there on blogs is are saying that

38:50.880 --> 38:55.280
between this and you saw at e three natsumi had made the bible game which

38:55.280 --> 38:57.160
was like jeopardy for bibles

38:57.160 --> 39:00.640
it's kinda like christian gaming is making this big come back you know it

39:00.640 --> 39:03.120
didn't we already have a matrix

39:03.120 --> 39:07.920
i wish that by matrix to come out in the states honestly i mean

39:07.920 --> 39:12.740
Go ahead make a Bible game. I mean what not I mean people are gonna play it

39:12.740 --> 39:18.920
And you've got the small following that you know follows the whole you know left behind series and whatnot

39:20.020 --> 39:26.180
Go ahead. If you think you're gonna make some money off of it. You know more power to you, but if you know if it fails

39:26.780 --> 39:30.540
No, we just told you so here's here's my last question to you guys

39:30.540 --> 39:37.060
And then we'll wrap up the show is this a good thing or a bad thing for gaming or does it strictly depend on?

39:37.060 --> 39:39.060
on how the game is?

40:07.060 --> 40:11.640
following have for this type of thing really other than that you know that's

40:11.640 --> 40:16.540
the only thing that's going to be depending on how good it's going to be. I mean, because if you have a good

40:16.540 --> 40:18.260
following behind it it's going to be good

40:18.260 --> 40:22.260
otherwise it's going to suck. I, you know what, I say it's a good thing for gaming

40:22.260 --> 40:25.780
because it'll keep, it'll take people's attention, certain people who need their

40:25.780 --> 40:29.340
attention taken away from games like Grand Theft Auto and because there's

40:29.340 --> 40:32.380
people out there they seriously are in this mindset that all video games are

40:32.380 --> 40:37.580
violent all video games are violent no no no video games movies art in any form

40:37.580 --> 40:43.460
the freaking news oh I'm on my thot art in any form is what you want it to be

40:43.460 --> 40:49.380
and as far if this can show people a certain people that need to see this and

40:49.380 --> 40:53.340
I'm not saying that everybody every Christian needs to see that's not that's

40:53.340 --> 40:56.980
not what I'm saying I'm saying certain hardcore people that are out there that

40:56.980 --> 41:00.900
are saying like video games are just they're all violent they're all

41:00.900 --> 41:05.620
plaguing society if this will help people see that not all video games have

41:05.620 --> 41:10.940
to be violent then I say it's a good thing yeah you know this is what I say

41:10.940 --> 41:18.380
being an artist myself the goal of an artist in the end is to provoke a

41:18.380 --> 41:24.980
reaction whether you are offended by it whether you don't like it whether you'd

41:24.980 --> 41:30.780
love it have a positive reaction getting that reaction getting feedback on

41:30.780 --> 41:35.700
on that reaction that is a goal of an artist because they know that their work

41:35.700 --> 41:40.860
be it a video game be it a piece of visual art or written they know that

41:40.860 --> 41:47.220
their piece created that response apathy is the worst thing an artist can have so

41:47.220 --> 41:51.220
then are we in agreement that video game creators are in fact artists I do agree

41:51.220 --> 41:57.900
Loki to a certain extent I I would assume but you know I mean it's like go

41:57.900 --> 42:01.860
crazy and assume that they're artists just because they create a video game I

42:01.860 --> 42:06.860
think I think it's I think it's art just in another form in a sense I mean let's

42:06.860 --> 42:11.560
not go crazy with just seeing you have writing involved it's you have art

42:11.560 --> 42:16.620
involved it's not a Mona Lisa okay no it's it's an art form it's not a way

42:16.620 --> 42:20.140
the art is art art is a way of expressing yourself right it's a

42:20.140 --> 42:24.300
combination of visual art I'd be willing to go that far it's a combination of

42:24.300 --> 42:29.280
visual arc dramatic arts you know because you've got the acting that goes

42:29.280 --> 42:34.340
into the game the storytelling aspect of it and you also have the the audio arts

42:34.340 --> 42:40.900
because you have music in the games it is an overall work of art some very deep

42:40.900 --> 42:45.380
subjects tonight I'm a fantasy is this a is this a like post drunken lethargic

42:45.380 --> 42:52.260
talk or something I don't know if I have no freaking clue how we've been talking

42:52.260 --> 42:55.260
The legal chatter thing got my brain working.

42:55.260 --> 43:00.260
If you were to ask me what we talked about in this podcast, I would have no clue.

43:00.260 --> 43:02.260
You can listen to it all week long and hear what an ass you were.

43:02.260 --> 43:05.260
You could wake up tomorrow going, why am I wearing this shirt?

43:05.260 --> 43:08.260
Yeah, honestly, I don't know where the hell these pants came from.

43:08.260 --> 43:11.260
Those are actually my pants, because you threw up on the other ones.

43:11.260 --> 43:12.260
Okay.

43:12.260 --> 43:16.260

43:18.260 --> 43:20.260

43:20.260 --> 43:24.360
Loki throwing up on himself not so good a note to end on so let's go video games

43:44.160 --> 43:47.680
handle my alcohol a lot better in San Diego and I don't know why but I guess

43:47.680 --> 43:54.680
