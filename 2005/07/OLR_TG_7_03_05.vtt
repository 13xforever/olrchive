[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of July 4th, 2005.

00:03.232 --> 00:13.884
[SPEAKER_00]: You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.

00:14.144 --> 00:17.568
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.

00:19.406 --> 00:29.954
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, everybody, and welcome to another edition of our podcast, Your Home, dedicated to video games and video gaming, most notably the games that don't suck.

00:30.495 --> 00:31.395
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Rob Roberts.

00:31.415 --> 00:32.436
[SPEAKER_02]: You might know me as Sky.

00:32.496 --> 00:36.819
[SPEAKER_02]: Joining me as always, my awesome co-host, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

00:36.859 --> 00:37.360
[SPEAKER_02]: There she is.

00:37.620 --> 00:38.361
[SPEAKER_03]: Cheerio, loves.

00:38.941 --> 00:39.762
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you doing, hon?

00:42.404 --> 00:42.904
[SPEAKER_03]: Recovering.

00:43.064 --> 00:45.626
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we'll talk about what's been going on here in a little bit.

00:46.067 --> 00:49.129
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the other corner, the one and only TechMazzaLoki.

00:50.384 --> 00:51.746
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, how you doing?

00:51.826 --> 00:52.508
[SPEAKER_02]: Holding up okay?

00:54.281 --> 00:57.222
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

01:23.830 --> 01:26.686
[SPEAKER_02]: We did a little bit of drinking.

01:26.706 --> 01:27.450
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit.

01:28.502 --> 01:30.782
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're recovering from that right now.

01:30.882 --> 01:37.184
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki more so than anybody because he had a little experience with my toilet, needless to say.

01:37.264 --> 01:38.144
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just leave it at that.

01:38.164 --> 01:41.085
[SPEAKER_02]: He was bowed down before the porcelain goddess.

01:41.225 --> 01:41.925
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

01:42.345 --> 01:43.625
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura and I, we're fine.

01:44.085 --> 01:45.745
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember, kids, don't drink and drive.

01:45.846 --> 01:47.686
[SPEAKER_02]: We're doing this because we have designated drivers.

01:47.706 --> 01:48.566
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't drink and date.

01:49.026 --> 01:49.646
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good rating.

01:49.686 --> 01:50.867
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, don't drink and date.

01:50.927 --> 01:51.767
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the especially important thing.

01:51.787 --> 01:53.367
[SPEAKER_03]: That might get you in a bit more trouble.

01:53.407 --> 01:56.108
[SPEAKER_02]: However, drinking and DDR is okay.

01:56.128 --> 01:57.428
[SPEAKER_03]: It's funny as hell.

01:58.328 --> 01:59.308
[SPEAKER_03]: I've played DDR Drunk.

01:59.469 --> 02:01.189
[SPEAKER_02]: I did Vegas once, I remember.

02:01.649 --> 02:03.290
[SPEAKER_02]: Of all places, I was playing DDR Drunk.

02:03.330 --> 02:05.491
[SPEAKER_02]: I just remember feeling very heavy.

02:05.671 --> 02:06.892
[SPEAKER_03]: My choker's choking me.

02:07.372 --> 02:07.632
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

02:08.272 --> 02:11.333
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, let's talk about our gaming weeks.

02:11.394 --> 02:15.015
[SPEAKER_02]: Before we get into the gaming news here on Orange Launch Radio, we always talk about our gaming weeks.

02:15.115 --> 02:17.136
[SPEAKER_02]: Starting off with the one and only DarkSakura.

02:17.156 --> 02:19.877
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you got your move done, so you got a chance to play any games this week?

02:19.957 --> 02:20.737
[SPEAKER_03]: We did move.

02:21.138 --> 02:26.320
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't played any games except the Potato Peeler on Gorillas.com and, of course, Widescreen Pong.

02:27.400 --> 02:31.682
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so, uh, we did, however, purchase a 50-inch HD widescreen TV.

02:31.762 --> 02:34.164
[SPEAKER_02]: I was gonna say, you have a sweet new gamer rig, if nothing else.

02:34.284 --> 02:39.146
[SPEAKER_03]: As soon as we pick up some, uh, component cables, I'm gonna be freaking trying out 2DX on that.

02:39.666 --> 02:41.987
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that the first game you're gonna try on there, is Beatmania 2DX?

02:42.008 --> 02:43.468
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell yeah.

02:43.788 --> 02:44.509
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

02:45.248 --> 02:46.048
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds good to me.

02:47.729 --> 02:49.390
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got a sweet gaming rig, it sounds like.

02:49.430 --> 02:52.932
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a better gaming rig than anybody else I know, so we're definitely going to have to go over there.

02:53.172 --> 02:57.974
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have to do a podcast over there at some point on your sweet new 50-inch TV.

02:57.994 --> 03:06.217
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually added the laptop to it, and we tried to watch Tokyo Breakfast, and it wouldn't load, so we watched The Deadly Negro.

03:07.578 --> 03:08.078
[SPEAKER_02]: Amazing.

03:08.458 --> 03:08.899
[SPEAKER_02]: What is that?

03:08.939 --> 03:09.459
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know it.

03:09.801 --> 03:15.762
[SPEAKER_03]: It's this guy who basically screams and yells motherfucker a lot to Afronova.

03:16.603 --> 03:18.043
[SPEAKER_03]: But the second one is funny.

03:18.143 --> 03:19.924
[SPEAKER_02]: Where can you get that from?

03:19.984 --> 03:22.444
[SPEAKER_03]: Totallycracked.com Sounds appropriate.

03:23.424 --> 03:27.785
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, you look a little dazed and confused right now, but can you tell us about your gaming week?

03:28.726 --> 03:29.386
[SPEAKER_02]: Make it coherent.

03:30.851 --> 03:34.936
[SPEAKER_01]: Miami Week is mainly Destroy All Humans.

03:34.996 --> 03:36.999
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty much all we've been playing this week.

03:37.720 --> 03:40.523
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually did finish the game itself.

03:41.365 --> 03:46.231
[SPEAKER_01]: It is pretty simplistic other than, you know,

03:47.045 --> 03:50.768
[SPEAKER_01]: Destroying All Humans, but it's a lot of fun.

03:50.828 --> 03:55.991
[SPEAKER_01]: They have the voice actor that does Invader Zim in it, so you gotta love that.

03:56.332 --> 04:00.475
[SPEAKER_01]: And other than that, it's a lot of fun, so definitely check it out.

04:00.915 --> 04:03.997
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't you say you got to take a sneak peek at some new PSP game?

04:04.437 --> 04:05.899
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I have a PSP.

04:06.559 --> 04:12.543
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm borrowing the PSP version of... What was it?

04:12.643 --> 04:12.944
[SPEAKER_01]: It was...

04:16.465 --> 04:17.786
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you're drunk, but think.

04:17.886 --> 04:18.387
[SPEAKER_01]: Think hard.

04:19.367 --> 04:20.008
[SPEAKER_01]: Think hard.

04:20.208 --> 04:28.334
[SPEAKER_01]: No, honestly, it's... I don't remember.

04:28.434 --> 04:30.596
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically... It's a lot of fun.

04:30.616 --> 04:33.297
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't even remember what the name of the game is.

04:39.702 --> 04:40.903
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but honestly, it's...

04:44.594 --> 04:45.595
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even remember.

04:46.176 --> 04:46.857
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, forget it.

04:47.398 --> 04:49.681
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some new PSP game that's coming out.

04:49.741 --> 04:50.522
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't believe that.

04:50.542 --> 04:51.283
[SPEAKER_01]: Dead to Rights.

04:51.303 --> 04:52.424
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.

04:52.464 --> 04:53.045
[SPEAKER_01]: Dead to Rights.

04:53.085 --> 04:54.327
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Dead to Rights.

04:55.929 --> 04:56.830
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been playing that.

04:57.230 --> 05:00.514
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically like Dead to Rights 2, but it's for the PSP.

05:00.575 --> 05:01.516
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got the dog.

05:01.616 --> 05:02.377
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot of fun.

05:03.295 --> 05:14.721
[SPEAKER_01]: um definitely check it out if you've got PSP because honestly there's not that much out right now it's for the PSP so PSP is suffering from what DS was suffering from like yeah exactly PSP syndrome basically

05:15.433 --> 05:16.633
[SPEAKER_01]: DS Syndrome Bullet Time Effect

05:38.243 --> 05:42.224
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, since the Matrix, um... Is it still cool?

05:42.284 --> 05:43.044
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I want to know.

05:43.364 --> 05:44.805
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, hell yeah, it's still cool.

05:44.885 --> 05:45.905
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, just check it out.

05:46.045 --> 05:47.886
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot of fun, honestly.

05:48.186 --> 05:59.129
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but if you really want to, you know, save some money and stuff, just download the Genesis emulators and whatnot and, um, play those because they don't cost anything and it's a lot of fun.

06:00.149 --> 06:06.851
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, definitely if you're out there buying PSP games, don't do it while you're drunk because, um...

06:07.916 --> 06:11.617
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, you're going to be spending money on stuff that you shouldn't be spending money on.

06:12.497 --> 06:13.538
[SPEAKER_01]: Take it from me, okay?

06:13.578 --> 06:16.598
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I'm, you know... Because you drink and go shopping all the time.

06:16.718 --> 06:18.619
[SPEAKER_01]: I drink and go shopping, yeah, exactly.

06:19.059 --> 06:21.300
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, you become sober and you're like, what the hell?

06:21.360 --> 06:22.240
[SPEAKER_01]: Why did I buy this?

06:22.380 --> 06:30.422
[SPEAKER_01]: So, honestly, folks, if you're drunk, just, you know, seriously, just, you know, make your peace with the porcelain god and...

06:31.421 --> 06:32.121
[SPEAKER_01]: Take it from there.

06:32.621 --> 06:34.802
[SPEAKER_02]: You're being a lethargic drunk tonight, I think.

06:35.082 --> 06:36.062
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very interesting.

06:38.382 --> 06:44.543
[SPEAKER_01]: I've already thrown up about four times over the porcelain god, as you would put it.

06:44.923 --> 06:47.184
[SPEAKER_01]: Kneel down before the porcelain goddess.

06:47.824 --> 06:56.745
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never actually thrown up while I've been drunk, so I've hit a whole new level of drunkenness.

06:56.785 --> 06:57.686
[SPEAKER_01]: Take it from me, though.

06:58.006 --> 06:59.766
[SPEAKER_01]: The PSP game version of...

07:00.766 --> 07:08.139
[SPEAKER_01]: Dead of the Rights is pretty cool, so I definitely recommend checking it out, but honestly, try it before you buy it.

07:08.640 --> 07:11.225
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't go out and buy these PSP games, because

07:11.769 --> 07:12.450
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching!

07:31.673 --> 07:39.535
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what the DS is all about, you guys, because the touchscreen adds so much to this game, because it allows the game to be fast-paced.

07:39.875 --> 07:42.775
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you move your blocks literally with the stylus.

07:43.656 --> 07:47.917
[SPEAKER_02]: You can play this game with the controller and the button, but it would not work.

07:47.977 --> 07:51.177
[SPEAKER_02]: Having to swap the bricks one at a time, it just would not work the same.

07:51.477 --> 07:56.779
[SPEAKER_02]: But having a stylus where you can drag your blocks up and down... Because the interesting thing about Meteos, you can't move them left and right.

07:56.819 --> 07:58.739
[SPEAKER_02]: You only move your blocks up and down, which is kind of weird.

07:59.360 --> 08:02.108
[SPEAKER_02]: It adds this whole new dimension to a puzzle game.

08:02.148 --> 08:04.094
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't explain it, but it makes it very fast-paced.

08:04.475 --> 08:05.558
[SPEAKER_02]: Meteos is very cool.

08:05.618 --> 08:06.440
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it because...

08:07.213 --> 08:16.700
[SPEAKER_02]: Being kind of a short attention gamer, or a gamer ADD, as I sometimes call it, where sometimes I only want to play a game for 5-10 minutes, Meteos works out really well for me.

08:17.981 --> 08:20.043
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people have been comparing this game to Luminous.

08:20.123 --> 08:22.064
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, of course, it's the same company, same developer.

08:22.505 --> 08:29.430
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say the music and graphics aren't quite what they are in Luminous, but I think that's just a system holdback.

08:29.470 --> 08:35.915
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, obviously on the PSP, which is more CD-based, you're going to get better music, and you get stuff like the Mondo Grosso track, Shinin', whatever.

08:36.455 --> 08:38.476
[SPEAKER_02]: It works out better for that.

08:38.576 --> 08:43.678
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's not to knock Meteos because it's an incredible concept for a game.

08:43.998 --> 08:47.539
[SPEAKER_02]: And the type of game it is, you could not do on the PSP because of the touchscreen and everything.

08:48.219 --> 08:55.542
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely, if you're a DS owner, if you like puzzle games to any extent, if you went out and bought Puyo Puyo Fever or you bought any other puzzler, Polarium.

08:55.842 --> 08:58.543
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, if you wasted the money on Polarium, trust me, you're going to love Meteos.

08:58.663 --> 09:01.424
[SPEAKER_02]: It redeems DS puzzlers by quite a bit.

09:01.524 --> 09:02.464
[SPEAKER_02]: So I highly recommend it.

09:02.584 --> 09:03.504
[SPEAKER_02]: That's been the game I've been playing.

09:03.524 --> 09:05.005
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still waiting for lecture, Plankton.

09:05.828 --> 09:08.069
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking forward to Electroplank and, of course, Nintendogs.

09:08.730 --> 09:09.170
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll see.

09:09.370 --> 09:10.331
[SPEAKER_03]: I got my puppies ordered.

09:11.792 --> 09:12.492
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you getting the U.S.

09:12.552 --> 09:13.252
[SPEAKER_02]: or Japanese one?

09:14.333 --> 09:14.833
[SPEAKER_03]: The U.S.

09:15.113 --> 09:17.655
[SPEAKER_03]: I know a lot of folks... Because I can get it at a 30% off discount.

09:18.425 --> 09:21.267
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's get into some gaming news.

09:21.327 --> 09:37.137
[SPEAKER_02]: First off though, I just want to welcome those of you guys that are subscribed to us through iTunes now, because iTunes 4.9 rolled out earlier, actually last week, as you probably know that, and a lot of folks finding Orange Lounge Radio thanks to that, doing a search for video games and finding us.

09:37.497 --> 09:39.478
[SPEAKER_02]: So a big hello to you guys, hope you enjoy the show.

09:40.119 --> 09:43.021
[SPEAKER_02]: Just remember, we're a little out of it tonight, so this...

09:43.661 --> 09:52.743
[SPEAKER_02]: This isn't quite representative of our normal perky selves, but darn it, we are giving you a podcast every week.

09:52.903 --> 09:55.564
[SPEAKER_02]: Come hell or high water, and I think this just proves it.

09:55.604 --> 09:57.825
[SPEAKER_02]: Or lots of booze.

09:58.045 --> 10:01.625
[SPEAKER_03]: I still can't believe I out-drunk Loki, and I'm more sober.

10:03.426 --> 10:06.367
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to ask you if anything's going on in the hack and crack scene.

10:06.387 --> 10:07.647
[SPEAKER_02]: In a couple sentences, anything?

10:12.506 --> 10:18.072
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the 1.5 version PSP stuff, but that was released last week.

10:18.693 --> 10:27.002
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than that, really the only thing to mention is the loader for the Luminous is available for the PSP.

10:28.732 --> 10:33.414
[SPEAKER_01]: So that means there's going to be more PSP games that they're actually running the ROMs for.

10:33.654 --> 10:37.056
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's kind of a gray area because that's piracy flat out, really.

10:37.096 --> 10:42.238
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that is piracy, but that's pretty much the big thing that's going on in the PSP world.

10:42.398 --> 10:50.141
[SPEAKER_02]: But if I'm not mistaken, wouldn't these versions of Luminous or whatever that you load on your memory stick, wouldn't they have stripped graphics?

10:50.201 --> 10:51.202
[SPEAKER_02]: Typically like a lot of...

10:52.422 --> 10:52.782
[SPEAKER_02]: What was it?

10:52.822 --> 10:53.482
[SPEAKER_02]: Dreamcast.

10:53.502 --> 10:56.763
[SPEAKER_02]: When they were trying to put those on CDs, they would sometimes have to strip out some of the audio.

10:57.284 --> 11:01.105
[SPEAKER_02]: Luminous, if you strip out the audio and some of the graphics, it's not going to be the same game.

11:02.065 --> 11:04.566
[SPEAKER_02]: The audio is essential to a game like Luminous.

11:04.606 --> 11:09.807
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what they're doing so far, but so far the thing that's being stripped out is all the audio.

11:10.408 --> 11:11.228
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not worth it.

11:11.248 --> 11:16.029
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really not worth it, but it is a step in the right direction, I guess, as far as pirating goes.

11:22.071 --> 11:24.133
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, who cares about pirating games?

11:24.153 --> 11:25.594
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, because most of the games suck.

11:26.215 --> 11:32.661
[SPEAKER_01]: But all you have to know is that I'm incredibly drunk right now, and that's really what counts.

11:32.681 --> 11:35.543
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody strip the caffeine out of Loki or something.

11:35.663 --> 11:39.367
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, folks, if I could feel better right now, that would be great.

11:39.867 --> 11:42.890
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything you could do to make me feel better, that would be great.

11:42.910 --> 11:44.171
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll pass off the penguin mints.

11:44.491 --> 11:44.771
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

11:47.023 --> 11:57.451
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, since we got some increased exposure, we've actually been getting some letters on our mailbox, togo, T-O-G-O, at orangeloungeradio.com, and we thought we'd take a minute to read some letters.

12:01.034 --> 12:03.636
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, let's open up the old Orange Lounge Radio letter bag.

12:05.049 --> 12:22.057
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, first email that we have comes from Sakurina, wrote us an email saying that Sakurina was actually listening to one of our older podcasts, the May 9th, 2005 podcast, and had some comments about the banning of violent video games to minors.

12:22.757 --> 12:28.500
[SPEAKER_02]: Sakurina says, I am a minor, and my parents follow and keep up with the ESRB rating system.

12:29.020 --> 12:33.223
[SPEAKER_02]: I've always kept up with the ESRB's rating system, and I've followed it as much as possible.

12:33.624 --> 12:40.769
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, I've never really played a mature game until Halo in 2001 when I was 10, and I didn't find myself mature enough to play them.

12:41.129 --> 12:47.894
[SPEAKER_02]: And I gave up on them until last year when I purchased Metal Gear Solid The Twin Snakes, my first mature game I ever purchased.

12:48.374 --> 12:53.502
[SPEAKER_02]: My parents actually ask me what I'm going to play, and they know how mature I am for each kind of game.

12:53.862 --> 12:56.426
[SPEAKER_02]: In other words, not all parents are retards.

12:56.967 --> 13:02.274
[SPEAKER_03]: Good for your parents, but my comments were strictly in reference to the majority.

13:03.716 --> 13:05.957
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, not all parents are retards.

13:05.997 --> 13:07.457
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to just reinforce that there.

13:07.957 --> 13:10.998
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some very intelligent parents out there, and yours sound like that.

13:11.018 --> 13:14.900
[SPEAKER_02]: And you sound like an intelligent individual as well, because you know what's good for you and what's not.

13:15.300 --> 13:21.121
[SPEAKER_02]: And we applaud those gamers that know how to distinguish the gaming world from real life.

13:21.222 --> 13:22.942
[SPEAKER_03]: And like people in Korea, apparently.

13:23.562 --> 13:25.303
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's that story we had last week.

13:25.803 --> 13:28.544
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's go on to the second letter we got.

13:28.664 --> 13:31.885
[SPEAKER_02]: Second letter we got was from Warrior Bob.

13:32.685 --> 13:40.767
[SPEAKER_02]: Warrior Bob was responding to something last week's show having to do with the ethicalness of emulated games.

13:40.847 --> 13:41.387
[SPEAKER_02]: Ethicality.

13:41.447 --> 13:42.087
[SPEAKER_02]: Ethicality.

13:43.047 --> 13:45.108
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I need to go back to grammar school.

13:46.508 --> 13:50.329
[SPEAKER_02]: Warrior Bob says, I think I'm somewhere between all your fine selves.

13:50.529 --> 13:58.851
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's perfectly okay to emulate something which is no longer easily available on the market out of print games like the pre-32-bit catalog.

13:59.249 --> 14:01.711
[SPEAKER_02]: Japanese games never released here, etc.

14:02.812 --> 14:05.894
[SPEAKER_02]: In the case of the re-released Nintendo games, the situation has changed.

14:06.254 --> 14:11.318
[SPEAKER_02]: Now these games like Zelda and Metroid are easily available on the market, but the price is somewhat questionable.

14:11.698 --> 14:16.702
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the emulation is valid with these titles, so long as an original NES copy is owned.

14:17.182 --> 14:20.546
[SPEAKER_02]: The fact that the titles are selling shows that there exists a market.

14:20.846 --> 14:25.771
[SPEAKER_02]: And as Jamie pointed out, many people consider it worth the price to have a portable version of the game.

14:26.172 --> 14:29.956
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I myself bought a copy of the GBA Zelda re-release.

14:31.398 --> 14:39.066
[SPEAKER_02]: So, of course, you know, there's something to be said about the added value of the convenience of having it in your GBA with all this complicated emulated stuff.

14:39.326 --> 14:39.707
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

14:54.725 --> 14:56.226
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well thank you guys for your letters.

14:56.287 --> 15:02.352
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, if you guys have any emails out there, you can always send us an email to go at orangeloungeradio.com.

15:02.392 --> 15:04.093
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's get into some gaming news tonight.

15:04.434 --> 15:09.358
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll start it off actually talking about the GBA and the DS.

15:09.738 --> 15:19.407
[SPEAKER_02]: This is interesting because the website Nintendojo is saying that 57,000 Nintendo DSs were sold in May to American consumers.

15:19.887 --> 15:21.568
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, how many sold versus how many shipped?

15:35.877 --> 15:36.557
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true, too.

15:36.637 --> 15:36.958
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

15:37.018 --> 15:38.118
[SPEAKER_02]: So it doesn't really account for all that.

15:38.458 --> 15:39.739
[SPEAKER_02]: However, this is what's interesting.

15:40.079 --> 15:43.700
[SPEAKER_02]: The GBA sold 237,000 units.

15:44.961 --> 15:48.202
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's outselling the DS, which is interesting.

15:48.222 --> 15:52.424
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that's just because it's cheaper or people just aren't into the DS thing?

15:52.464 --> 15:53.264
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think's up with that?

15:53.964 --> 15:56.065
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it has to do with both of those reasons, actually.

15:57.225 --> 16:00.727
[SPEAKER_03]: And also keep in mind the way marketing works for them, at least in Japan.

16:01.345 --> 16:01.645
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of them.

16:26.481 --> 16:26.861
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

16:27.241 --> 16:30.024
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm using my DS as my GBA as well.

16:30.584 --> 16:41.793
[SPEAKER_02]: Our buddies over in Europe, there's a story being announced there that the DS in Europe has sold 1 million units and that's since the portable launch there three months ago.

16:42.153 --> 16:45.076
[SPEAKER_02]: Worldwide DS sales now at 6 million.

16:45.116 --> 16:46.797
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's taken off in Europe.

16:47.742 --> 16:54.686
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know the PSP, they're cracking down on the importing of the PSPs before it's actually released out there and all this interesting stuff.

16:54.726 --> 16:56.927
[SPEAKER_03]: Which should actually be coming up in the next Mother Show.

16:57.268 --> 16:57.988
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, very soon.

16:58.068 --> 16:59.709
[SPEAKER_02]: So you guys don't have to wait much longer for that.

17:01.497 --> 17:05.799
[SPEAKER_02]: There was actually a lot of news this week about MTV, which I think is very interesting.

17:08.300 --> 17:12.502
[SPEAKER_02]: MTV has formed their own MTV Games unit.

17:13.122 --> 17:22.846
[SPEAKER_02]: MTV Games is devoted to, quote, "...developing, producing, and promoting unique and creative gaming experiences that resonate with MTV's audience."

17:23.246 --> 17:31.793
[SPEAKER_02]: And this kind of falls in line with another article that's been floating around in the music game community saying that MTV is talking, they want to get into the music games.

17:32.654 --> 17:37.317
[SPEAKER_02]: But I can't help but think, haven't MTV put out games already to some extent?

17:37.357 --> 17:38.558
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I remember there was a remote control.

17:38.578 --> 17:39.479
[SPEAKER_03]: The music generator games.

17:39.679 --> 17:43.042
[SPEAKER_02]: The music generator games, the remote control games on Nintendo.

17:43.914 --> 17:50.737
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm thinking, okay, the difference is that those were games put out by other companies using the MTV license.

17:51.357 --> 17:53.898
[SPEAKER_02]: Now MTV wants to do their own thing.

17:54.578 --> 17:55.819
[SPEAKER_02]: So what do you think?

17:56.059 --> 17:59.140
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it going to be commercially successful?

17:59.160 --> 18:02.622
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, let's face it, MTV, huge marketing machine, they get free advertising.

18:02.902 --> 18:03.282
[SPEAKER_02]: Crap.

18:05.036 --> 18:32.088
[SPEAKER_01]: are you saying that just because you're getting older and jaded with MTV or do you truly believe there's something else here there's gonna be stupid children that's gonna buy it though MTV does not know how to market games honestly I mean they hello look at it's MTV a channel itself it's supposed to be music music on their channel it's all just stupid reality TV shows I mean hello road rules the game honestly folks um

18:33.228 --> 18:39.235
[SPEAKER_01]: They might be able to market it as a game, but I think it's gonna fail overall.

18:39.736 --> 18:40.937
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the way I think it is.

18:51.488 --> 18:55.751
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to jointly... Basically what's going to happen, it's like a partnership for marketing.

18:56.011 --> 19:01.255
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to jointly sell in-game advertising and collaborating on the soundtracks and things like that.

19:01.615 --> 19:03.757
[SPEAKER_02]: Now get this, Midway has LA Rush, right?

19:04.097 --> 19:11.442
[SPEAKER_02]: What they're going to do is they're going to take some branding from Pimp My Ride on MTV and incorporate that into LA Rush.

19:11.662 --> 19:12.363
[SPEAKER_01]: Good for them.

19:12.443 --> 19:16.446
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, as long as they get their game out there, I mean, whatever way they...

19:16.906 --> 19:17.847
[SPEAKER_01]: Managers do that.

19:17.967 --> 19:18.947
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good for them.

19:19.047 --> 19:22.529
[SPEAKER_02]: Works out for Midway because they get free marketing, basically.

19:22.549 --> 19:23.330
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly.

19:23.630 --> 19:26.431
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that disgrace the L.A.

19:26.892 --> 19:28.092
[SPEAKER_01]: Rush franchise?

19:28.192 --> 19:29.653
[SPEAKER_01]: No, honestly, L.A.

19:29.713 --> 19:32.095
[SPEAKER_01]: Rush wasn't that good of a game to begin with.

19:32.915 --> 19:37.658
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd rather see them pushing the Pimp My Ride aspect of that.

19:38.298 --> 19:41.480
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, it's really sad that that game really sucked.

19:41.620 --> 19:45.022
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the problem is, is that... I don't mind L.A.

19:45.042 --> 19:45.762
[SPEAKER_02]: Rush, it's alright.

19:45.942 --> 19:46.603
[SPEAKER_02]: It was okay!

19:46.623 --> 19:48.744
[SPEAKER_02]: I enjoyed, like, Hydro Thunder and Arctic Thunder.

19:48.824 --> 19:49.684
[SPEAKER_01]: It was okay!

19:49.785 --> 19:53.206
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem was, it lost all the aspects of the Rush series.

19:53.567 --> 20:06.254
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the Rush series is basically like, okay, you have, like, you know, a set track that you go to, there's a few shortcuts and whatnot, and there's some really cool, you know, shortcuts you can take that, you know, involve, like, a lot of big jumps and whatnot.

20:06.274 --> 20:06.354
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

20:07.791 --> 20:09.493
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, any thoughts on this?

20:26.816 --> 20:28.418
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

20:45.879 --> 21:14.794
[SPEAKER_02]: either that or we would let our 4 year old babies die so in order to help better your life we're here to offer you some advice to help better your life in many ways and who better to bring that advice to you than DarkSakura with her advice column today's bit of advice is how to survive a fall onto subway tracks number one do not attempt to climb back onto the platform unless you are positive you have enough time to do so

21:16.031 --> 21:19.714
[SPEAKER_03]: 2.

21:16.652 --> 21:19.714
[SPEAKER_03]: Find a safe place to stand out of the way of the oncoming train.

21:22.235 --> 21:19.714
3.

21:22.315 --> 21:28.079
[SPEAKER_03]: Stand against a wall between columns separating two tracks on an adjoining set of tracks or beneath the platform.

21:29.251 --> 21:35.596
[SPEAKER_03]: 4.

21:29.672 --> 21:35.596
[SPEAKER_03]: Remove any articles of clothing or bags that could catch on the train and stand still, straight, and tall.

21:35.656 --> 21:36.177
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, I don't get that.

21:36.197 --> 21:37.838
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not supposed to jump on the platform?

21:37.858 --> 21:38.198
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you do?

21:38.218 --> 21:41.321
[SPEAKER_02]: You jump on the other tracks where the train isn't coming and hope you're right?

21:41.621 --> 21:46.905
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a middle section that has the pillars that hold the area up between where the alternating tracks are.

21:47.125 --> 21:48.686
[SPEAKER_02]: Not every subway system.

21:48.746 --> 21:50.987
[SPEAKER_03]: Not every, but there are many that do.

21:51.007 --> 21:52.267
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I'm thinking about Bart.

21:52.407 --> 21:57.310
[SPEAKER_02]: Bart doesn't have, okay, the picture you have shows, okay, I understand that, but like Bart doesn't have that.

21:57.390 --> 22:00.731
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I fall on the tracks on Bart, I'm dead, basically, is what you're saying.

22:00.751 --> 22:00.911
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

22:01.252 --> 22:01.492
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

22:01.712 --> 22:02.952
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless you can get your ass up.

22:03.152 --> 22:03.613
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, I'm sorry.

22:03.633 --> 22:05.253
[SPEAKER_03]: But my final piece of advice.

22:05.273 --> 22:05.514
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

22:06.514 --> 22:08.375
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't fucking ride the subway to hit a taxi.

22:14.438 --> 22:17.400
[SPEAKER_02]: Our New York friends can benefit from this piece of advice.

22:17.420 --> 22:18.061
[SPEAKER_02]: How about this?

22:18.781 --> 22:21.604
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't cross the yellow line, kids.

22:22.004 --> 22:24.987
[SPEAKER_03]: Each knee, each knee, Suicide Club, yo.

22:26.008 --> 22:27.750
[SPEAKER_02]: If you got that reference, hats off to you.

22:30.472 --> 22:31.633
[SPEAKER_02]: Big news this week.

22:31.673 --> 22:32.053
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't...

22:59.795 --> 23:02.017
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure a lot of you guys have heard a lot about this story.

23:02.418 --> 23:03.659
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm curious what you guys think.

23:03.859 --> 23:07.003
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, what do you think about this, this peer-to-peer ruling?

23:07.243 --> 23:10.827
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think this is fair, that Grokester should be held responsible for what its users do with it?

23:13.385 --> 23:42.920
[SPEAKER_03]: ultimately they are providing the means so legally the service that provides the means for the illegal activity has a right of responsibility they would basically be found negligent for allowing the misuse of their material however there is not a way to regulate this which again in the eyes of the court would be you shouldn't offer this service don't operate your business

23:44.110 --> 23:47.292
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, that takes money out of their pocket.

23:48.012 --> 23:53.555
[SPEAKER_03]: Which, taking money out of the pocket of a small business eventually will hurt the economy.

23:54.315 --> 23:58.377
[SPEAKER_03]: Therefore, they're basically treading on some thin ice right here, the courts and the company.

23:59.138 --> 24:09.003
[SPEAKER_03]: So the court's probably looking at this as a way to hold them responsible as a party while maintaining balance in industry.

24:10.263 --> 24:11.584
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if that makes sense to you.

24:12.566 --> 24:13.727
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, okay, I'll follow you.

24:13.987 --> 24:17.150
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, I'm coming from having taken that business law class.

24:17.650 --> 24:18.171
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, all right.

24:18.952 --> 24:20.093
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, moving on.

24:20.533 --> 24:21.974
[SPEAKER_02]: My thoughts on this whole thing.

24:22.094 --> 24:26.058
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it really depends on how you're marketing your peer-to-peer network.

24:26.598 --> 24:29.401
[SPEAKER_02]: I think if you're marketing your peer-to-peer network as...

24:30.542 --> 24:34.525
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, come to our network and trade your illegal MP3 files on our network.

24:34.826 --> 24:37.428
[SPEAKER_02]: Then yes, I think you can be held responsible.

24:37.808 --> 24:53.523
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think if you're marketing your network as something that should be used for legit purposes, the trading of open source programs or what have you, and this is what you're encouraging your users to do and you're discouraging your users via marketing,

24:53.823 --> 24:57.644
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I have a case that I can repeat, and I'll go home my case.

24:57.684 --> 24:58.204
[SPEAKER_02]: The weed eater.

25:21.931 --> 25:34.477
[SPEAKER_03]: has a warning on it that says, do not allow people under the age of, I believe that it was 15 years old, within 20 feet of this machine while being operated.

25:36.298 --> 25:38.619
[SPEAKER_03]: In this case, an uncle was weed eating the lawn.

25:39.580 --> 25:41.921
[SPEAKER_03]: The thing was fully on the machine.

25:42.961 --> 25:44.822
[SPEAKER_03]: 10 year old kids picking up dirt after it.

25:45.602 --> 25:48.663
[SPEAKER_03]: The uncle, the mom's like off doing something else.

25:48.703 --> 25:50.684
[SPEAKER_03]: She's there but not observing her child.

25:51.705 --> 25:53.545
[SPEAKER_03]: The guy hits a rock with the weed eater.

25:54.145 --> 25:55.626
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is the one with the metal blades.

25:56.606 --> 25:57.387
[SPEAKER_03]: It recoils.

25:58.227 --> 26:00.748
[SPEAKER_03]: Goes backwards and slices off the child's arm at the elbow.

26:02.349 --> 26:06.370
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, we are looking at this as logical adults.

26:07.751 --> 26:08.771
[SPEAKER_03]: Who do you think would be at fault?

26:11.240 --> 26:16.003
[SPEAKER_03]: As a logical adult, would it be the uncle for his negligence?

26:16.583 --> 26:17.684
[SPEAKER_03]: Or would it be the weed eater company?

26:18.624 --> 26:22.006
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it would be the child because they're dumb enough to walk next to him.

26:22.026 --> 26:22.947
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, using common sense.

26:23.007 --> 26:26.589
[SPEAKER_02]: It falls in one of those categories of accidents happen.

26:26.609 --> 26:28.590
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a car, accidents happen.

26:28.870 --> 26:30.711
[SPEAKER_02]: It's unfortunate, but it was an accident.

26:30.771 --> 26:32.172
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think anybody's liable in that case.

26:32.712 --> 26:33.873
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my opinion is logical.

26:34.221 --> 26:38.824
[SPEAKER_03]: In the state of Oklahoma, there are three cases for a company to be held liable for negligence.

26:39.525 --> 26:45.289
[SPEAKER_03]: That's for default of the machine, accident caused by said default, to misuse of the item.

26:45.970 --> 26:51.293
[SPEAKER_03]: The company was actually found at fault for a default that the machine did not have.

26:51.874 --> 26:58.619
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, taking that example, that poison notice on the bottle of bleach isn't going to mean shit.

27:00.300 --> 27:05.342
[SPEAKER_03]: unless it is proven that the child swallowed the item while the parent was negligent.

27:05.722 --> 27:07.023
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it is the parent's fault.

27:07.403 --> 27:13.925
[SPEAKER_02]: However, again... Well, okay, tying this back to the peer-to-peer network thing before we lose too many people in our analogies.

27:13.965 --> 27:16.326
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, but I'm using it as... No, I understand, I understand.

27:16.746 --> 27:18.027
[SPEAKER_02]: But no...

27:18.857 --> 27:27.665
[SPEAKER_02]: The MPAA or the RIAA is not going to... Well, I guess they have been suing the individual users to some extent, but having very limited success in doing so.

27:27.745 --> 27:30.447
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's bad, bad PR for them, too.

27:31.168 --> 27:33.149
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

27:33.229 --> 27:35.311
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, the way that this ties into the peer-to-peer.

27:36.532 --> 27:37.773
[SPEAKER_03]: Peer-to-peer office of service.

27:38.474 --> 27:43.258
[SPEAKER_03]: They do have the disclaimers on there that this is not to be used for X purposes, right?

27:43.278 --> 27:43.358
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

27:44.154 --> 27:48.546
[SPEAKER_03]: some of them it depends on the network even those that have that notice on there

27:49.469 --> 27:55.813
[SPEAKER_03]: If their product is being, quote, misused, they're still responsible.

27:56.193 --> 27:56.653
[SPEAKER_03]: That's interesting.

27:56.693 --> 27:59.555
[SPEAKER_03]: In the eyes of the court, they should still be responsible.

27:59.635 --> 28:03.257
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, again, logically, that doesn't make sense.

28:03.657 --> 28:10.061
[SPEAKER_03]: Logically, it should be in the hands of the person who is misusing the product as long as the disclaimer exists.

28:10.541 --> 28:16.905
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, another thing, too, is that when they download that service, there's usually, and I've studied this, there is a click agreement.

28:17.512 --> 28:20.580
[SPEAKER_03]: by clicking that little box that says you agree to their terms of service

28:21.582 --> 28:26.363
[SPEAKER_03]: You are signing a contract that says, I will not misuse this item.

28:26.783 --> 28:29.944
[SPEAKER_03]: I will not do this for anything other than a specific purpose intended.

28:30.284 --> 28:33.485
[SPEAKER_02]: So even after all that, the companies could still be held liable?

28:33.885 --> 28:50.089
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't, if they are in the case that they have that as a full part of their agreement, and the parties violating that terms of service have clicked that agreement, they're using their product, and that clause exists,

28:50.729 --> 28:52.369
[SPEAKER_03]: I do not believe the company should be held liable.

28:52.630 --> 28:53.390
[SPEAKER_03]: They put it in there.

28:53.870 --> 28:57.071
[SPEAKER_03]: It is the point of the user at that point.

28:57.671 --> 29:02.892
[SPEAKER_03]: Violating terms of service which removes negligence from the company.

29:03.012 --> 29:03.732
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the reality.

29:03.772 --> 29:04.673
[SPEAKER_02]: How many people read that?

29:05.133 --> 29:05.973
[SPEAKER_02]: No one does.

29:06.893 --> 29:09.654
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, maybe 5% of the users of it.

29:10.254 --> 29:13.715
[SPEAKER_03]: Still, how many people buy a house and don't read their mortgage?

29:13.875 --> 29:14.075
[SPEAKER_03]: True.

29:15.471 --> 29:16.672
[SPEAKER_03]: I work at a mortgage company.

29:17.032 --> 29:19.815
[SPEAKER_03]: How many freaking calls did I get when I was in customer service?

29:20.335 --> 29:22.917
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do I have a prepayment penalty?

29:23.137 --> 29:24.878
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, didn't you read your contract?

29:24.918 --> 29:27.680
[SPEAKER_03]: You had three days to change your fucking mind.

29:28.841 --> 29:30.903
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, pardon me for my rudeness on that.

29:31.523 --> 29:34.645
[SPEAKER_03]: But people need to freaking read.

29:35.506 --> 29:37.447
[SPEAKER_03]: You sign a contract, you need to read it.

29:37.528 --> 29:40.370
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that in the case of this peer-to-peer networks...

29:41.221 --> 29:43.604
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that they shouldn't be held at fault at all.

29:43.664 --> 29:47.428
[SPEAKER_03]: However, those who are too stupid to put that clause in there, oh yeah, nail them.

29:48.108 --> 29:48.569
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously.

29:48.829 --> 29:51.452
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, many different perspectives on this issue.

29:51.472 --> 29:52.753
[SPEAKER_02]: A very hot button issue in the community.

29:52.793 --> 29:54.555
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have thoughts, we'd love to hear them.

29:54.675 --> 29:56.837
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sorry for going off on the legal aspect of it.

29:56.877 --> 29:59.400
[SPEAKER_03]: That's something that really I research.

29:59.460 --> 30:02.343
[SPEAKER_02]: We want people to think about the different perspectives of looking at it.

30:02.703 --> 30:06.125
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people are just stomping their foot going, that's not fair.

30:06.205 --> 30:08.306
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to keep downloading music for free.

30:08.366 --> 30:09.286
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not fair.

30:09.947 --> 30:16.790
[SPEAKER_03]: In the case of this, you have to really look at the big picture to understand what's going on.

30:16.850 --> 30:19.131
[SPEAKER_03]: The average gamer, I don't think is going to do that.

30:19.371 --> 30:22.233
[SPEAKER_03]: The average gamer is probably going to be teenage, lower 20s.

30:22.573 --> 30:24.274
[SPEAKER_03]: The average gamer.

30:28.102 --> 30:29.504
[SPEAKER_02]: To hugely generalize, yes.

30:29.844 --> 30:34.448
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're not going to be in the age group that is known for thinking about this type of thing.

30:35.309 --> 30:46.279
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, but if you're going to have an opinion, it's a good idea to have an informed opinion as opposed to stomping your foot and acting like an ignorant little child.

30:47.560 --> 30:48.481
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry is the truth.

30:49.402 --> 30:51.964
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're here to help educate you and think about this.

30:51.984 --> 30:53.005
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly, exactly.

30:53.045 --> 30:53.286
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

30:54.028 --> 30:54.608
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move on.

30:54.649 --> 30:55.849
[SPEAKER_02]: We lost Loki.

30:56.010 --> 30:56.810
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's all right.

30:57.030 --> 30:58.271
[SPEAKER_02]: Did Loki pass out finally?

30:58.291 --> 30:58.692
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

30:58.712 --> 30:59.512
[SPEAKER_02]: He's still with us, Loki?

30:59.913 --> 31:00.173
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

31:00.553 --> 31:01.694
[SPEAKER_02]: He's still there a little bit.

31:02.294 --> 31:02.555
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

31:02.775 --> 31:04.456
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, do you have a thought on the peer-to-peer thing?

31:04.536 --> 31:05.917
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you get your microphone back up there?

31:06.157 --> 31:07.278
[SPEAKER_02]: We dropped it earlier.

31:07.298 --> 31:08.759
[SPEAKER_03]: The opinion of the average drunk.

31:09.120 --> 31:10.241
[SPEAKER_02]: What are we talking about now?

31:10.881 --> 31:11.542
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

31:12.422 --> 31:15.845
[SPEAKER_02]: Peer-to-peer networks said you can be held liable.

31:16.145 --> 31:19.688
[SPEAKER_02]: The Supreme Court says you, grokester, can be held liable because people misuse your service.

31:19.708 --> 31:20.709
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never heard of grokester.

31:21.189 --> 31:29.936
[SPEAKER_01]: My thought is, you know what, honestly, those peer-to-peer networks, they know that there's legal files being shared on there.

31:30.756 --> 31:37.061
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just doing the best they can to, you know, cover their asses, so... Honestly, um...

31:38.442 --> 31:42.486
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need to go through Grokester to find all the files that you're looking for.

31:42.506 --> 31:44.889
[SPEAKER_01]: The hell with Grokester.

31:44.909 --> 31:46.610
[SPEAKER_02]: You are bringing up this point that a lot of people say.

31:46.690 --> 31:49.473
[SPEAKER_02]: When you squelch one problem, it just gets bigger.

31:49.493 --> 31:51.936
[SPEAKER_02]: For instance, if they had never shut down Napster...

31:52.888 --> 31:54.709
[SPEAKER_02]: iTunes probably would be a lot more successful.

31:54.729 --> 32:00.972
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though iTunes is having a lot of success now, iTunes would probably be more successful if it had showed up before they shut down Napster.

32:01.012 --> 32:03.533
[SPEAKER_02]: Because people would have went from Napster to iTunes.

32:03.593 --> 32:06.955
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead, people went from Napster to... Well, actually, and I take that back.

32:07.375 --> 32:10.336
[SPEAKER_02]: iTunes did exist in some form on the Mac only, though.

32:10.636 --> 32:14.218
[SPEAKER_02]: But Mac only has a smaller share than the PC.

32:14.418 --> 32:17.200
[SPEAKER_03]: I went from Napster to... What was that?

32:17.300 --> 32:17.700
[SPEAKER_03]: Music...

32:19.091 --> 32:41.529
[SPEAKER_03]: Audio Galaxy Some people went to LimeWire, Nutella, there was a lot From that I went to Kazaa and now I'm on BitTorrent And the problem is getting worse and worse And I, by the way, am downloading files illegally And if you come try to search through my computer, oh government I'm going to fucking nail your ass to the goddamn wall and get you to fucking pay me

32:42.290 --> 32:50.258
[SPEAKER_03]: for violation of privacy and violating my rights under the Constitution.

32:50.618 --> 32:53.060
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, I'm going to nail you if you pull that shit on me.

32:53.120 --> 32:55.002
[SPEAKER_02]: You do know anyone can listen to this podcast, right?

32:55.262 --> 32:55.723
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I don't care.

32:55.923 --> 32:57.424
[SPEAKER_02]: They do it.

32:57.905 --> 33:01.368
[SPEAKER_03]: We are on unregulated freaking radio.

33:01.708 --> 33:02.389
[SPEAKER_03]: I will nail you.

33:03.750 --> 33:04.071
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

33:04.691 --> 33:05.712
[SPEAKER_02]: Them's fighting words.

33:06.253 --> 33:06.693
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care.

33:09.915 --> 33:11.756
[SPEAKER_02]: The BBC is running a story.

33:11.796 --> 33:14.417
[SPEAKER_02]: This story actually being linked from Slash.

33:14.457 --> 33:15.157
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this is interesting.

33:15.717 --> 33:21.179
[SPEAKER_02]: BBC is running a story saying that women are going to explode onto the gaming scene any minute now.

33:25.460 --> 33:27.221
[SPEAKER_03]: I just exploded on the gaming scene.

33:28.536 --> 33:30.397
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, I'm not really downloading illegal files.

33:30.557 --> 33:33.978
[SPEAKER_02]: You can pretty much figure where the rest of this story is going.

33:34.038 --> 33:40.101
[SPEAKER_02]: Saying that online role-playing games are doing good with women, despite the subject matter, da-da-da.

33:41.541 --> 33:44.963
[SPEAKER_02]: Women gamers in the UK make up a quarter of the gaming population.

33:44.983 --> 33:46.583
[SPEAKER_02]: 39% in the US, 69% in South Korea.

33:50.771 --> 33:56.193
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

34:11.704 --> 34:14.166
[SPEAKER_03]: I enjoy my Phantasy Star Online.

34:15.066 --> 34:16.247
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been a week without it.

34:17.828 --> 34:19.029
[SPEAKER_03]: But it doesn't matter.

34:20.210 --> 34:24.653
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is there a stupid report about this freaking bullcrap?

34:25.354 --> 34:28.796
[SPEAKER_02]: Because a lot of horny guys out there want to be gay or women.

34:28.836 --> 34:31.278
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you're like, oh my god, girls play video games!

34:31.458 --> 34:33.920
[SPEAKER_03]: What is the freaking 21st century?

34:34.300 --> 34:35.501
[SPEAKER_03]: Get with the times!

34:35.561 --> 34:36.722
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't need a study!

34:37.042 --> 34:38.383
[SPEAKER_02]: There were girls that played Atari.

34:39.164 --> 34:39.484
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.

34:40.024 --> 34:41.484
[SPEAKER_03]: I played Atari, hello.

34:41.504 --> 34:44.845
[SPEAKER_02]: But admittedly, not as many women play games as guys.

34:45.145 --> 34:48.426
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that needs to freaking change, but you don't need a report to tell you this.

34:49.586 --> 34:50.486
[SPEAKER_02]: So what do they need to do?

34:50.546 --> 34:51.346
[SPEAKER_02]: Really quickly, what do they need to do?

34:51.366 --> 34:54.947
[SPEAKER_03]: They need to turn off their Xbox and go out and meet people.

34:55.687 --> 34:56.447
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, I'm not talking about that.

34:56.467 --> 34:56.787
[SPEAKER_02]: Get laid.

34:56.827 --> 34:58.028
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you get more women in games?

35:00.108 --> 35:01.428
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it the type of games they're putting out?

35:01.468 --> 35:02.609
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it the way they market them?

35:03.009 --> 35:04.749
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it just society stigma?

35:05.538 --> 35:08.619
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the average woman interest is ridiculous.

35:09.119 --> 35:10.479
[SPEAKER_03]: They need like Cosmo the game.

35:11.860 --> 35:13.540
[SPEAKER_02]: So Paris Hilton needs to put out a video game.

35:13.980 --> 35:14.500
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess.

35:14.620 --> 35:16.241
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, how to be a social whore.

35:17.181 --> 35:20.181
[SPEAKER_02]: But the rest, no gamer would ever take a game like that seriously.

35:20.221 --> 35:25.083
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like Mary Kay and Ashley learn to drive or whatever, Sweet 16 are the laughing stock of the gaming world.

35:25.383 --> 35:25.603
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

35:26.303 --> 35:30.784
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the thing is, is that I play freaking Ragnarok and Ragnarok's cutesy.

35:31.697 --> 35:36.458
[SPEAKER_03]: I played Final Fantasy XI, I played Phantasy Star Online.

35:37.158 --> 35:40.919
[SPEAKER_03]: I played Halo until I found out it made me motion sick.

35:40.959 --> 35:49.361
[SPEAKER_03]: My favorite game of all time is freaking Guardian Legend, which is one of the single hardest video games ever.

35:49.962 --> 35:55.463
[SPEAKER_03]: I played Abadox, which was supposed to be the most gory video game when it came out.

35:55.503 --> 35:56.423
[SPEAKER_03]: You're just special, though.

35:56.603 --> 35:57.523
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it boils down to.

35:57.804 --> 35:59.504
[SPEAKER_03]: I am a true gamer woman.

36:01.216 --> 36:05.267
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel sorry though for other women to have me as the voice of the gaming community.

36:07.029 --> 36:08.690
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the violent stuff.

36:09.290 --> 36:10.950
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's the game?

36:11.290 --> 36:12.751
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple more stories here, you guys.

36:13.031 --> 36:16.232
[SPEAKER_02]: PlayStation 3 will not be coming out with a hard drive.

36:16.372 --> 36:19.293
[SPEAKER_02]: Xbox 360, they are saying they're going to do a 20 gig hard drive.

36:19.613 --> 36:22.174
[SPEAKER_02]: PlayStation 3, nope, not coming with it.

36:22.254 --> 36:27.775
[SPEAKER_02]: There will be a slot where you can put in an 80 gig hard drive a little later on, but no hard drive in the outset.

36:28.415 --> 36:33.557
[SPEAKER_02]: To me, this is kind of striking me as these stories are really kind of a bigger deal than I think they ought to be.

36:34.652 --> 36:54.814
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it just really depends on the games that are coming out if the games come out and they don't require a hard drive because none of the games they have out right now really require a hard drive console wise save maybe Final Fantasy 11 a couple other exceptions that's all you need that's all the gaming system needs to be successful are good games right

36:56.039 --> 36:57.380
[SPEAKER_03]: And I only use it for that.

37:22.734 --> 37:23.174
[SPEAKER_03]: Koji Sugitani

37:42.837 --> 37:49.479
[SPEAKER_02]: He is a video game voice actor, and he contributed to Xenosaga, and he said in his blog, I'm doing another one.

37:49.840 --> 37:53.541
[SPEAKER_02]: So he kind of let the cat out of the bag that there is a Xenosaga 3 on the way.

37:53.761 --> 37:55.201
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we kind of figured that.

37:55.241 --> 37:56.762
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think we kind of figured that.

37:56.822 --> 38:05.805
[SPEAKER_02]: Namco, by the way, not making any official statement on that, but in the blog it says he has begun recording work for the next installment in the series.

38:06.165 --> 38:10.987
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of not a big surprise, but I'm sure a lot of fans will be happy to know that yes, it is indeed happening.

38:12.262 --> 38:17.803
[SPEAKER_02]: And lastly tonight, a story about a gaming company called Left Behind Games.

38:18.484 --> 38:20.264
[SPEAKER_02]: You might know the term Left Behind.

38:20.304 --> 38:26.325
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a famous book series that's big in the Christian and religious world.

38:26.706 --> 38:32.327
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about what happened after the rapture, basically, and those folks that were left behind after the rapture.

38:32.567 --> 38:33.687
[SPEAKER_03]: Burn and inhale!

38:34.507 --> 38:35.568
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, get this.

38:35.688 --> 38:40.989
[SPEAKER_02]: They are making a PC game based on those novels.

38:42.984 --> 38:43.725
[SPEAKER_02]: Not surprising.

38:44.045 --> 38:45.466
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how that's going to work.

38:46.186 --> 38:56.814
[SPEAKER_02]: But it seems like now a lot of sites out there and blogs are saying that, hmm, between this and you saw at E3, Natsumi had made the Bible game, which was like Jeopardy for Bibles.

38:57.275 --> 39:00.237
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like Christian gaming is making this big comeback.

39:00.277 --> 39:02.279
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what, didn't we already have Black Matrix?

39:03.319 --> 39:05.301
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish that Black Matrix would come out in the States.

39:05.701 --> 39:09.744
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, I mean, go ahead and make a Bible game.

39:09.964 --> 39:10.765
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, why not?

39:11.371 --> 39:19.013
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, people are going to play it, and you've got the small following that follows the whole Left Behind series and whatnot.

39:20.413 --> 39:20.813
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead.

39:20.853 --> 39:24.694
[SPEAKER_01]: If you think you're going to make some money off of it, more power to you.

39:24.774 --> 39:28.595
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it fails, well, we just told you so.

39:29.336 --> 39:31.656
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's my last question to you guys, and then we'll wrap up the show.

39:31.836 --> 39:38.978
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this a good thing or a bad thing for gaming, or does it strictly depend on how the game is?

39:40.801 --> 39:46.005
[SPEAKER_01]: I think honestly it's not going to be good or bad for gaming.

39:46.265 --> 39:50.548
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically whether people are going to buy into it or not.

39:51.609 --> 39:55.192
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a matter of whether this is going to be good or bad for gaming.

39:55.832 --> 40:00.095
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just how many people are going to be behind this type of game.

40:02.537 --> 40:08.942
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just really depending on how much of a following you have for this type of thing.

40:09.873 --> 40:14.397
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, other than that, you know, that's the only thing that's going to be depending on how good it's going to be.

40:14.637 --> 40:18.160
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, because if you have a good following behind it, it's going to be good.

40:18.280 --> 40:19.781
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, it's going to suck.

40:20.582 --> 40:20.902
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

40:20.962 --> 40:28.888
[SPEAKER_02]: I say it's a good thing for gaming because it'll take people's attention, certain people who need their attention taken away from games like Grand Theft Auto.

40:29.008 --> 40:32.852
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there's people out there, they seriously are in this mindset that all video games are violent.

40:33.312 --> 40:34.273
[SPEAKER_02]: All video games are violent.

40:34.333 --> 40:34.653
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.

40:35.113 --> 40:38.136
[SPEAKER_02]: Video games, movies, art in any form.

40:38.156 --> 40:38.436
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.

40:41.097 --> 40:43.718
[SPEAKER_02]: Art in any form is what you want it to be.

40:44.558 --> 40:52.400
[SPEAKER_02]: And if this can show people, certain people that need to see this, and I'm not saying that every Christian needs to see this.

40:52.420 --> 40:54.081
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not what I'm saying.

40:54.101 --> 41:02.063
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm saying certain hardcore people that are out there that are saying video games are just, they're all violent and they're all plaguing society.

41:02.443 --> 41:07.505
[SPEAKER_02]: If this will help people see that not all video games have to be violent, then I say it's a good thing.

41:08.883 --> 41:12.005
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, this is what I say being an artist myself.

41:13.526 --> 41:19.108
[SPEAKER_03]: The goal of an artist, in the end, is to provoke a reaction.

41:20.129 --> 41:27.212
[SPEAKER_03]: Whether you are offended by it, whether you don't like it, whether you love it, have a positive reaction.

41:28.718 --> 41:43.211
[SPEAKER_03]: Getting that reaction, getting feedback on that reaction, that is a goal of an artist because they know that their work, be it a video game, be it a piece of visual art or written, they know that their piece created that response.

41:44.032 --> 41:46.674
[SPEAKER_03]: Apathy is the worst thing an artist can have.

41:47.134 --> 41:50.217
[SPEAKER_02]: So then are we in agreement that video game creators are in fact artists?

41:50.678 --> 41:51.138
[SPEAKER_03]: I do agree.

41:51.999 --> 41:52.279
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki?

41:52.619 --> 41:55.622
[SPEAKER_01]: To a certain extent, I would assume, but you know.

41:56.829 --> 42:01.672
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, let's not go crazy and assume that they're artists just because they create a video game.

42:02.013 --> 42:04.514
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's art just in another form.

42:05.315 --> 42:05.975
[SPEAKER_01]: In a sense.

42:06.035 --> 42:10.258
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, let's not go crazy with saying that... You have writing involved.

42:10.978 --> 42:11.919
[SPEAKER_03]: You have art involved.

42:11.979 --> 42:14.021
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not the Mona Lisa, okay?

42:14.121 --> 42:14.401
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

42:14.921 --> 42:15.742
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an art form.

42:16.042 --> 42:18.283
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not fine art, but it's art.

42:18.443 --> 42:19.864
[SPEAKER_02]: Art is a way of expressing yourself, right?

42:19.964 --> 42:23.467
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a combination of visual art... I'd be willing to go that far.

42:23.707 --> 42:26.249
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a combination of visual art, dramatic arts,

42:27.229 --> 42:31.491
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, because you've got the acting that goes into the game, the storytelling aspect of it.

42:32.152 --> 42:34.153
[SPEAKER_03]: And you also have the audio art.

42:35.133 --> 42:36.594
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you have music in the games.

42:37.154 --> 42:39.015
[SPEAKER_03]: It is an overall work of art.

42:40.225 --> 42:41.646
[SPEAKER_02]: Some very deep subjects tonight.

42:41.666 --> 42:42.366
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Fantasy.

42:43.206 --> 42:46.488
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this a post-drunk and lethargic talk or something?

42:46.548 --> 42:47.388
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what it is.

42:47.448 --> 42:52.630
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, I have no freaking clue what the hell we've been talking about.

42:52.810 --> 42:55.171
[SPEAKER_02]: The legal chat, I think, got my brain working.

42:55.211 --> 43:00.334
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were to ask me what we talked about in this podcast, I would have no clue.

43:00.394 --> 43:02.575
[SPEAKER_02]: You can listen to it all week long and hear what an ass you were.

43:03.675 --> 43:05.560
[SPEAKER_01]: Why am I wearing this shirt?

43:13.891 --> 43:16.111
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's wrap up the show, please.

43:16.131 --> 43:17.952
[SPEAKER_02]: And ribbons in both.

43:18.052 --> 43:20.472
[SPEAKER_02]: The video games are a good thing to end on.

43:20.572 --> 43:21.792
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki throwing up on himself.

43:21.912 --> 43:23.113
[SPEAKER_02]: Not so good a note to end on.

43:23.153 --> 43:23.653
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's go ahead.

43:23.913 --> 43:26.653
[SPEAKER_02]: Video games, art, yay, happy, shiny.

43:26.993 --> 43:27.313
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

43:27.613 --> 43:28.354
[SPEAKER_02]: Final thoughts.

43:28.414 --> 43:29.334
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, your final thought.

43:29.474 --> 43:34.315
[SPEAKER_01]: My final thought is I need to pace myself with as far as drinking goes.

43:35.015 --> 43:41.236
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe next time, you know, ice would be a little bit better in my drinks because, you know, the warm drinks aren't that great.

43:41.276 --> 43:41.456
[SPEAKER_01]: But...

43:42.697 --> 43:43.118
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

43:43.719 --> 43:47.286
[SPEAKER_01]: I was able to handle my alcohol a lot better in San Diego and I don't know why.

43:47.506 --> 43:52.255
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess they were just skipping on the alcohol, but I don't know.

43:52.896 --> 43:53.037
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

43:53.780 --> 43:57.583
[SPEAKER_02]: My final thought is I'm very much looking forward to seeing the letter bag this week, the mail bag.

43:57.924 --> 43:59.645
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you guys write some good emails this week.

43:59.685 --> 44:00.246
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't wait to read them.

44:00.526 --> 44:02.528
[SPEAKER_02]: And sorry to those of you who didn't get your emails read on air.

44:02.848 --> 44:04.790
[SPEAKER_02]: We try to be fair and just select a couple.

44:04.830 --> 44:09.253
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but I reply to everybody who emails me except for the really dumb.

44:10.234 --> 44:12.536
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot of stuff going on in the PSP world.

44:12.616 --> 44:16.279
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure I didn't cover it because I don't remember covering it.

44:16.460 --> 44:17.781
[SPEAKER_02]: Get to it next week when you're sober.

44:17.821 --> 44:21.484
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, folks, I mean, there's a lot of cool stuff going on in the PSP world.

44:21.960 --> 44:25.362
[SPEAKER_01]: Just, you know, check it out on PSPUpdates.com.

44:25.662 --> 44:26.963
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of good stuff on there.

44:26.983 --> 44:28.463
[SPEAKER_01]: DSupdates.com.

44:28.904 --> 44:29.944
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of good stuff on there.

44:30.424 --> 44:33.286
[SPEAKER_01]: They're actually doing 360updates.com and whatnot.

44:33.746 --> 44:37.088
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're going to find some good stuff on there, so check it out.

44:37.588 --> 44:39.009
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, DarkSakura, your final thought.

44:39.440 --> 44:45.107
[SPEAKER_03]: Reject false icons and next summer I will be in London for a couple days.

44:46.008 --> 44:50.554
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would love to meet up with some of our UK listeners and interview a couple of them.

44:50.774 --> 44:53.337
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to be on the East Coast in a couple weeks, but I'll give more details on that later.

44:53.998 --> 44:56.441
[SPEAKER_03]: I will also be in France and I will also be in Italy.

44:57.042 --> 44:57.462
[SPEAKER_02]: Lucky!

44:58.484 --> 45:00.625
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to be chaperoning high school students.

45:01.105 --> 45:01.766
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sounds like fun.

45:01.806 --> 45:02.106
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

45:02.146 --> 45:02.346
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

45:02.386 --> 45:03.046
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's wrap it up.

45:03.346 --> 45:07.708
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you guys for subscribing and putting up with ourselves for another week here on the podcast.

45:07.748 --> 45:08.589
[SPEAKER_02]: We hope you enjoyed it.

45:08.969 --> 45:10.089
[SPEAKER_02]: See you next time, everybody.

45:11.470 --> 45:15.052
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the end of another Orange Lounge Radio To Go edition.

45:15.352 --> 45:20.914
