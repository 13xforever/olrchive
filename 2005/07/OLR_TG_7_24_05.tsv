410	2953	Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of July 25th, 2005.
3074	14207	You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.
14468	17892	Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
19642	25804	Hello, everybody, and welcome to another week of the Orange Lounge Radio to-go edition.
25844	29386	This, by the way, if I've done my math right, is our 30th show.
29446	30146	Can you believe that?
30166	35688	We've been here every single week for about the past six months, a little more, seven months.
35908	38029	Ever since January, we've started this thing.
38089	40450	So thank you guys for sticking with us throughout this whole thing.
40470	42891	And, of course, hello to our new listeners as well.
42931	43851	We appreciate you guys.
44226	49270	Deciding to check us out and listening to our little program here about video games that don't suck.
49590	51952	Although sometimes we have to talk about the sucky ones too.
52333	54214	But just to warn you to stay away from them.
54674	56516	My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.
56576	58557	Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts.
59398	62040	Right over there, the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
62320	62961	Yo, yo, yo.
63381	63802	What up?
64102	64682	Menchie Hat.
65783	66244	How you doing?
66424	67044	Menchie Hat.
67365	68986	What is the Menchie Hat for those that may not know?
69985	74366	It's a hat that looks like the top of Minchi's head for anyone who's ever watched Excel Saga.
74746	75386	Excel Saga.
76326	78467	Alright, and over there is the one and only Loki.
78947	79387	Yes I am.
79667	80087	I'm right here.
80467	80967	How you doing?
82008	82648	I'm doing good.
82948	83408	Sounds good.
83988	85508	Alright, let's go around.
85548	90849	We always like to start off the podcast letting you know about our gaming week and how we're doing in our gaming worlds.
91210	92710	So I'm going to start off with DarkSakura.
92730	93430	What have you been up to?
94330	97011	I haven't played much of anything except DDR at the beginning of the week.
97151	97871	Like one game.
99182	100523	What got you into DDR suddenly?
101363	103605	The fact that we were being filmed for the news.
105245	107146	Oh yeah, I totally forgot to say that.
107186	110828	Hello to anybody who might have seen us on the local news here in Sacramento.
111008	114110	That was my really cool jeans.
115731	117051	Oh yeah, that you saw in the article?
117111	118472	I was playing Silent Hill.
120673	125335	We were featured in a story on podcasting in the local news, so hello to anybody that found us through that.
125736	126396	Appreciate it.
127409	129309	Hopefully you weren't scared off by the way we look.
130290	133950	Or Loki saying, gosh, podcasting is fun.
135230	136331	Gosh, I'm an idiot.
136451	138131	Or his sound clip, whatever he got.
138451	141692	Yeah, let's cut it down to really something stupid.
142152	143192	What's the stupidest line he can say?
143292	144112	Oh, there it is, there it is.
144212	145212	Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it.
145452	146432	Got it, yeah.
147032	147432	I laughed.
147813	148373	Anyway, Loki.
148393	149753	Yeah, you laughed and he called me.
149933	150853	Oh, you're an idiot.
151373	153614	They made me look like a dumbass on TV.
154314	154694	That's funny.
155314	156154	And I watched him like.
157665	160586	IntelligentLicense IntelligentCube
174707	175588	Thank you for watching!
191861	193663	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
212037	212958	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
232587	233727	But other than that, no.
234028	235288	Does it have orchestra music?
235328	237609	Because I remember Intelligent Cube had a very strange soundtrack.
237689	239669	It was all this big orchestra music.
239689	241770	It's got pretty good music in it, so it's decent.
242450	242930	More of the same.
243070	244871	But I've been playing that a lot.
245091	246812	And then, what was it?
246892	248532	Just recently I've been playing Peekaboo Poker.
249352	250053	Please.
250973	257395	On the Nintendo emulator, which is one of the three adult games for the...
258666	262968	Nintendo Entertainment System, and it's very craptastic.
263148	265229	It's by the same people that did Bubble Bath Babes.
265249	269311	Bubble Bath Babes and Hot Slots, so I have all three of those.
270143	271824	There are some winning games right there.
271904	276946	I remember seeing Bubble Bath Bays back in the day in a rental store, and I was like, I'm going to play that someday.
277426	278787	And I did, and I was disappointed.
279748	281208	Then I played Killer7.
281248	282809	I progressed through another two levels.
283189	287551	And there's these one Heaven Smile things you have to attack.
287571	289712	They have t-shirts, and it's cool because you can just shoot them.
289932	291333	Then they have Giant Smile.
291953	295835	This game right now, I thought progressing through it, I'd figure out what's going on.
296423	299965	The more and more I progress through the game, the less and less I understand what's going on.
300365	301065	But it's still fun.
301565	302406	So I'm playing through it still.
303666	303986	Very cool.
304026	304386	Anything else?
305047	305367	That's it.
306227	306867	My gaming week.
307228	310649	I mentioned this very briefly at the end of the last podcast.
310749	319232	I just got a new television because my old one, the RCA yellow thing was coming loose and so my video kept fading in and out.
319613	325355	So I just finally decided to upgrade my TV and I went over to a big warehouse type store
325697	328558	and I bought a 30 inch HDTV widescreen.
328838	330759	So now I'm all about the widescreen games.
330799	336221	I'm like, oh, I gotta go back and play all these games because they're gonna look pretty and widescreen and I gotta find the ones that have the good graphics.
336601	338922	So I thought, okay, I'm gonna play Halo 2.
338962	341223	That's a very pretty looking game.
342323	345605	So I got on Halo 2 and I've been downloading the new maps and checking them out.
345945	348906	And I also got on and decided to play on Xbox Live again.
349246	353087	Because they've been doing all these updates to the game lately, so I thought I'd see if it played any differently.
353407	357188	And for someone like me, who's a casual Halo 2 gamer, I can't tell there's been any differences at all.
357228	358048	Except for the new maps.
358128	359568	And the new maps, you know, good idea.
359808	361208	Keeps the game fresh, so that's good.
362269	366649	One thing I did realize, however, is that I am the worst Halo 2 player on the entire internet.
367149	368410	Seriously, I'm horrible.
368470	371150	I've played several games and my ranking hasn't budged.
371490	372430	That's how bad I am.
372891	374911	So, if you ever see me...
375566	375826	Halo 2 Halo 2
397642	399483	Let's get into some gaming news tonight.
399724	406609	And tonight I want to start off, actually I should mention, since I was talking about Halo 2, there actually was a new Halo 2 update this week.
407029	409431	They're calling it the Banhammer update.
409511	411052	Basically what they're doing is that
411448	413629	Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time.
431673	432533	Thanks for watching!
450459	451020	and DarkSakura.com.
474830	480212	Cheating is not honored around here and we will ban your ass type things.
480612	483352	Obviously they don't use that kind of language, but you get the idea.
483412	488034	They're trying to put these little public service announcements that we catch you, we ban you type things.
488614	501217	They're just trying to curb the people that feel like they have to cheat to get ahead in Halo 2 because being the number one person on the Halo 2 leaderboard apparently wins you all this type of fame and fortune and all this stuff.
501777	503538	Every kid wants to be it.
503658	503958	I don't know.
504795	505495	I don't understand.
505555	506956	Why would somebody want to cheat on Halo 2?
507616	507936	It's fun.
507956	508456	Just to get ahead.
508756	509717	Nothing better to do.
509957	511297	It's fun to get away with it.
511617	513278	They use the internet for self-validation.
513718	517539	Just like people in Final Fantasy XI who are teleporting themselves around.
518299	520140	We have people on our link show that do that, actually.
521140	525742	Speaking of Final Fantasy XI, maybe for not much longer, because they actually had a patch this week.
526202	529183	Their patch actually had a little something to do with Chains of Promethea.
529203	533264	They actually added a little more to the story in Chains of Promethea, and they added some more
533612	537514	So basically they're trying to wrap up the storyline there.
537534	539295	43 megabyte download for PC users.
539355	540035	It's a pretty big quest.
540055	541616	I'm so glad I quit that damn game.
541656	542156	You know what?
542216	544517	Quit raining on the rest of our parades.
545077	546198	What, did you start playing again?
546618	547338	I'm thinking about it.
547638	549479	No, no, you said you played PSO with me.
549679	550860	I haven't played in a month.
551340	552441	No, no, no, PSO.
552661	553381	I'm thinking about it.
553401	554261	But I downloaded the patch.
555922	556683	But you haven't played the game.
556703	557403	I haven't played in a month.
557703	561885	Because the woman is yelling at me.
562335	563135	Thanks for watching!
572076	584144	Well, one thing that'll make the Final Fantasy fans happy, and this is actually something that made me happy because I've been waiting for them to do this for a long time, and it is something that is making me consider going back, but I'm not making any decisions until my work trips over next month.
584225	595012	But what they did is that they are going to have some of these items that were selling for tons and tons of Gil, the Leaping Boots, the Emperor's Hairpin, now they're rare EX items.
596293	599015	So Gil sellers can't camp them anymore for Gil, so...
599753	604274	Of course, they'll find other ways to make their money with the gil selling, but they're trying to at least curb that a little bit.
604334	605934	So, very interesting.
606315	611556	By the way, Squeenix, what we call Square Enix, they recently registered a brand new trademark.
611596	613736	It's called Treasures of Aturgen.
614396	617637	Hmm, maybe a new Final Fantasy XI expansion?
617837	618197	Who knows?
618217	620678	There was actually two names that were registered.
620978	621838	Oh, I didn't see the second one.
621858	622518	I only heard that one.
623158	624379	I can't remember the other one.
624959	625719	I'll have to look it up.
626058	626278	All right.
626558	632383	Well, either way, rumors going around that with the Xbox 360 release, we're going to see a new expansion pack anyway.
632763	634305	So, all right.
634365	636306	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
636426	636867	Cut it out.
637247	637687	All right.
639229	640930	Let's open up the old mailbag.
640990	643312	We'll get into something DarkSakura might be interested in.
643352	644413	We'll go to the mailbag.
644433	645994	I've got lots of good ones.
646174	648216	We got some good mail this week in the mailbag.
649016	651158	I got more than what I actually ordered.
652980	654241	Do you want to start off by reading one, then?
654261	655442	Or do you want me to go to one?
655482	655762	Go ahead.
656192	658213	Alright, I'm going to start it off with an email.
659053	661815	This one came in from Rob.
662475	666157	Rob wanted to follow up with something that we were saying about the Silent Hill last week.
666177	668097	We were talking about Silent Hill 4 last week.
668558	670198	And somebody had been dogging on Silent Hill 3.
670579	671159	I don't remember.
672259	674080	No, you like Silent Hill 3, right, DarkSakura?
674220	676060	I think it might have been our emailer was dogging on it.
676420	682662	But Rob wanted to say that the PC version of Silent Hill 3 is a gazillion CDs, but it's only $9.99.
684122	686963	Best of all, it contains the Silent Hill 3 soundtrack.
687383	689644	I bought the soundtrack and got a game for free.
690364	692444	It's a good way to check both out.
693024	699106	My response to him was if you buy Silent Hill 3 for the PlayStation 2, you get the soundtrack.
700003	700263	Really?
700643	700863	Yes.
701123	701944	But for PC it's only $10.
702564	703664	How much is it on PS2 right now?
703924	706085	It's got to be at least a great $10, right?
707445	712587	So either way, I like that when they throw in those bonuses like the soundtrack and things to get you to check the game out.
712627	713787	That is pretty cool.
714247	720749	And I just mentioned the other name that was out there that Square Enix registered was Scars of War.
721450	721750	Thank you.
722590	723710	That could be its own game, though.
724110	724491	Probably.
724751	728752	I also got another one from him talking about...
730660	741067	How is in Toys R Us the other day, and the six-year-old could understand that an M-rated game was for a teen and not for the kid, but parents don't seem to understand that?
741507	741767	Mm-hmm.
742247	743028	I think that's pretty funny.
744594	745855	In a very sad way.
746195	750157	Yeah, in a very sad way that the six-year-old understands the ratings better than his parents, certainly.
751578	757142	I wanted to read another email here that came from... Let's see, who was this person?
757402	759583	TheBrainTrust was the person that sent this email.
760123	762685	And he was actually talking about the hot coffee mod.
763525	766027	He talked a lot about that in the beginning of his email.
766047	771670	And he had an interesting perspective on that, basically, that he thought that video games overdo it sometimes.
772891	773571	and DarkSakura.com.
802092	803773	Tell that to the fundamentalists.
804233	807575	To that I say, you're right.
808596	819262	When we're kind of poking fun at the whole thing and we're saying that Christians think that these games are evil, I'd like to think that usually we preface it by saying that it's
819813	821894	The extremists we're talking about in this case.
821914	824196	The ones who actually publicly make the complaint.
824336	825417	The 700 Club.
825557	830400	Not every Christian is a crazy, foaming at the mouth, like crazy, I'm going to ban games.
830420	832521	Like the morons behind the Chick Tracks.
833302	837805	You know, whoever has succeeded Jerry Falwell in his camp.
838645	840246	You know, the fundamentalists.
840346	848231	And I have some good friends who are Christians, and I'm not, you know, I personally am not into that religion, but I have no problem being a Christian.
848251	848952	I went to church today.
849940	850440	There you go.
850740	854161	Besides, it's not really hip to make fun of Christian people.
854201	856382	It's hip to make fun of Scientology.
856562	857182	Oh, yeah, that's true.
857202	858402	We have a new religion to be making fun of.
858422	859923	It's always been funny to make fun of Scientology.
860323	873946	In all seriousness, and you can say this about any group of people, whether it be a religious group, an ethnic group, a, I don't know, whatever you come up with, a group of anybody, gamers even, there's always a few bad apples that ruin it for everyone.
873986	877107	So when we poke fun, we're only poking fun at the extremists
877688	879990	Obviously, there's plenty of great Christian folks.
880130	884654	I have friends that are Christians, just like I have friends that are Buddhists and friends that are other religions.
885154	893240	And the great thing about the country where we live in, playing the anthem, is that you can have freedom of religion and choice and all that good stuff.
893260	894181	But not for much longer!
896763	898184	Yeah, freedom of choice, but the government knows better.
898204	899925	Remember, keep voting in those conservatives.
899966	901307	That'll be gone real quick.
901327	904189	Don't start the political thing or we're going to get tons and tons of emails.
904309	905250	I'm not, I'm not, I'm not.
905270	906931	I watched Outfoxed last night.
907810	909782	You got another email you want to read, DarkSakura?
910345	911150	I lost my place.
911989	914270	I got another one then, if you don't have one.
914691	915231	Keep going.
915591	916572	I wanted to read this one.
916612	917272	This is cool.
917312	924836	This was from a guy named Chris, and he actually works on a site called A Society Wildcard.
925476	934181	He wants to say, I wanted to thank you guys for providing an excellent, entertaining, and informative podcast amongst the mediocrity and crap that is swimming out there in the podcast ocean.
934561	935262	That's quite a compliment.
935302	935902	Thank you.
935922	936462	That's very cool.
936482	939544	That's no way to be talking about Governor Schwarzenegger's podcast.
940404	941725	Thanks for watching!
956637	962883	Um, so please, um, make sure you subscribe to the show via iTunes or via iPod or some other form.
963263	966827	Don't rely on necessarily, um, Podcast Alley.
967487	973132	Although it's a great site, I'm not going to knock Podcast Alley, it's a great site and we have a lot of great people who have voted for us over there as well.
973733	973793	Um,
974782	981143	It's just really, really big, and they don't have time to work on each little individual podcast and its problems.
981223	982704	He's given us a plug on his show.
982724	984464	I think it's only fair to do the same for him.
984724	985304	Absolutely.
985364	986084	He's got a show.
986284	986724	You want to do that?
987004	993426	If you go to thechrissshow.blogspot.com, his podcast is available there.
994446	994766	Sounds good.
994986	1001067	And he says he's a filmmaker, so I just want you to know that if you need a good actor, I do all my own nude scenes, just so you know.
1003220	1004522	I can do voice acting.
1004642	1008126	I have my kick-ass one-liners like podcasting.
1008787	1009548	It's so much fun.
1010789	1012531	Alright, you got any more emails for us, DarkSakura?
1012551	1013132	We'll do one more.
1014213	1015515	I know I sent you a bunch.
1015535	1017798	I think we got most.
1017858	1018599	Oh, here was another one.
1018939	1019299	Here's one.
1019440	1019920	I'll read this one.
1019940	1020581	This will be the last one.
1021142	1021242	Um...
1022495	1025217	This one comes to us from Brian in Michigan.
1025917	1028819	And he says he's been listening to the podcast for a few weeks now.
1028879	1029200	Thank you.
1030380	1033602	And he enjoys the discussion and our thoughts on the news that's interesting.
1033642	1035324	He likes the fact that we kind of talk about things.
1035364	1036925	We don't just kind of report, report, report.
1036945	1037365	So thank you.
1037385	1038005	We appreciate that.
1038686	1041027	Also, another vote for the Drunken Loki episode.
1041188	1041688	He liked that.
1043629	1043869	Anyway.
1043889	1044590	I have one more.
1047034	1048195	Oh, no, I want to say the rest.
1048215	1049336	There's another part to this here.
1049757	1050918	He's got a suggestion for us.
1050998	1054261	How about some discussion on popular mods for PC games?
1054761	1058365	He says, I don't think mods get enough airtime, and there are some great ones out there.
1058685	1064430	Let's also not forget how many mods have become full games and how many modders have received jobs in the industry.
1064951	1065791	Very interesting point.
1065871	1069355	I have to admit, unfortunately, I don't play a lot of PC games.
1069435	1071557	I do most of my gaming on console.
1072097	1074299	Not that I don't respect a lot of PC games out there.
1074339	1080124	I'm actually really looking forward to Civilization 4, which, by the way, is supposed to be very mod-friendly.
1080384	1084667	They're supposed to be building this whole programming language, and they're going to make it very mod-friendly.
1084707	1085588	I think that's very cool.
1086129	1088511	Loki, you would probably know more about the modding thing.
1088971	1090572	Why don't you talk about the PC mods so much?
1090632	1093254	Well, I don't play a lot of PC games anymore.
1093495	1095096	Honestly, what I've been playing...
1096132	1097433	Maybe Grand Theft Auto a little bit.
1097593	1098854	I have the hot coffee mod.
1099094	1111304	I haven't actually played the hot coffee portion because getting the damn girlfriends to actually understand you and like, you know, you have to take them out on dates and it's really hard because they want to go do drive-bys and they end up dying a lot of times.
1111324	1113906	They get shot in the head and you're like, oh, your girlfriend's dead.
1114226	1115507	Oh, damn.
1116207	1116928	So I don't do that.
1116988	1121571	Instead, what I do is I download even more mods like the spider car mod where you can drive cars up walls.
1121611	1125014	Just crazy stuff like actually doing my own modding where you just
1125582	1127763	Adjust the aspects of different cars and stuff.
1128703	1129724	But there's some pretty cool ones.
1130124	1139327	There's one for, I think it was Unreal or Quake, the Enter the Tube or whatever like that, the Penny Arcade mod that they had for that.
1139388	1140108	That was pretty cool.
1141748	1145650	There's a lot of mods out there, but unfortunately, I don't play a lot of them.
1145830	1148351	It's just not in the budget for us to be getting a lot of PC games.
1148571	1152673	The last mod I ever did was Gatchaman Quake.
1154358	1154898	That's old.
1154918	1156720	Quake was almost 10 years ago, so it's old.
1157120	1161162	Quake Rally, where they turned that game into a racing game.
1161483	1165045	But some of those like that get adopted and get huge followings to them.
1166446	1175011	If any game publishers out there want to send us some free games, and we will definitely look into how the internet is modding your game on the PC, we'll certainly talk about it on the show.
1175732	1177593	Drop us an email, togo, T-O-G-O.
1178053	1179154	at OrangeLingerie.com.
1179254	1182455	And you should do that anyway if you have any general comments on the show.
1182495	1183555	You got one more email for us?
1183816	1187817	We had one from someone named Spencer just talking about the music games.
1188678	1191379	Wanted our opinions on Rockstar, Red Octane, Mad Catz.
1192099	1193980	And he's apparently an Indie Group fan.
1194280	1198682	But I have to say that if you really want our true opinion on the music games, you should probably check out our live show.
1199252	1201554	That's true, we do talk about it for three hours.
1202175	1204357	Well, that's kind of a loose term.
1204377	1205738	A three-hour train wreck.
1205798	1207900	We talk strictly about the music games.
1207940	1215927	We do do a live show on OrangeLawnRadio.com for three hours every Sunday night, and you can hear Loki really rip on In the Groove, because he doesn't care for the game.
1216788	1220331	And I will second that, because In the Groove is kind of, but...
1220922	1223304	I, on the other hand, I'm not bothered by In the Groove.
1223344	1226485	I think it does some good things for the dance game community.
1226706	1238813	For those who don't know what In the Groove is, it's kind of controversial in the music game scene because it was a game that was made by fans of Dance Dance Revolution who were sad to see that Dance Dance Revolution stopped.
1239333	1239974	and DarkSakura.
1259065	1260606	Basically, it's just very controversial.
1261426	1263727	I like In the Groove somewhat.
1263787	1265647	I like some of the things that it brings to the table.
1266027	1268708	I like some of the music in the game.
1269028	1272790	I think Mines, when used appropriately, is an interesting new twist on the dance game.
1274070	1278632	But there's a lot of things I don't like about it, and a lot of it has to do with the online community.
1278692	1288555	I hate to say it, but I just really hope you're not one of these guys that's online saying, you know, oh, DDR is dead and DDR sucks because In the Groove owns everything.
1289025	1294487	Okay, In The Groove does one-up DDR on some things, but... It would not have existed without DDR.
1294507	1305630	Yeah, we have to can't forget that In The Groove would not exist without DDR, and the fact that DDR is not dead, it's got plenty of home releases still coming out, including Extreme 2, Ultramix 3 coming out later this year.
1306050	1314012	And again, not to dog on the scene as a whole, because I know some really nice people in the In The Groove scene, but just some of the message boards really ruffle my feathers.
1315097	1317478	I too got an email, but it was something funny.
1317618	1327061	It was referring back to the episode in which I mentioned how games help kids fight with diseases.
1327162	1328422	And I mentioned Tumor Raider.
1329042	1331083	Someone sent me a Clarisworks file.
1331423	1334164	And if I remember correctly, I think Clarisworks is a Mac.
1335044	1336785	It's something that runs on an Apple PC.
1337534	1342437	Unfortunately, I do not, you know, I do not have such inferior PCs.
1342457	1343718	We're not even going into this.
1343738	1343978	Next story.
1343998	1346460	Not start the Apple versus PC thing again.
1346500	1349662	Because we do not need to hear the closed-minded speak out of his ass.
1351423	1351883	All right.
1352724	1353384	Moving on.
1353564	1354905	Hey, I have some fun news.
1355305	1356126	You have a fun news?
1356166	1356886	What do you want to tell us about?
1356906	1357787	Not really fun.
1357887	1358788	It's really depressing.
1359148	1359548	All right.
1359988	1361429	Can we play the happy music again?
1361830	1362190	Yeah.
1362230	1362570	No.
1363170	1363691	No.
1364071	1364972	This would be horrible.
1365132	1365392	All right.
1365412	1366232	No, read the story.
1366252	1366513	All right.
1366553	1366973	Read the story.
1368880	1378425	A 12-year-old named Gary Lloyd, apparently in London, hung himself after his mother took away his PlayStation.
1380006	1384668	It turned out to be he was doing it to get attention, and his little prank went wrong.
1386029	1393052	So, any children listening to the show, if your mom takes away your PlayStation, don't hang yourself, because you'll die.
1393472	1394553	Yeah, try going outside.
1395393	1396013	Or do something else.
1396233	1399695	Yeah, there's like a world out there with air and birds and stuff.
1401816	1403476	All he needed was just an extra life.
1405397	1405957	So wrong.
1406337	1406797	So wrong.
1407338	1408818	Wah, wah, wah, boo!
1408898	1416701	But it is pretty crappy, just... Kids... Half of me wants to say it's Darwinism at work.
1417402	1419202	Hey, there's something else going on here.
1419562	1422144	I'll have you know, Grand Theft Auto does not have hangings.
1422544	1423364	Texas does, though.
1426747	1434653	Moving on, speaking of Grand Theft Auto and like stories, we have a story about the Miami attorney Jack Thompson.
1435073	1435954	Maybe you know this guy.
1435994	1437715	He's crazy!
1438056	1443319	He's foaming at the mouth crazy when it comes to wanting to rip video games, a new one, for being too violent.
1443339	1444741	Well, guess what game he's going after now?
1445221	1445601	Sims 2!
1446702	1450425	Yes, he says that naked people in The Sims 2 is just...
1451187	1451688	Horrible.
1452068	1452709	Here's a quote.
1452769	1462759	Sims 2, the latest version of the Sims video game franchise, contains, according to the video game news sites, full frontal nudity, including nipples, penises, labia, and pubic hair.
1463019	1463560	Okay, come on.
1463580	1464241	That's pathetic.
1464321	1464861	You know what?
1464941	1465582	No, it doesn't.
1465722	1467304	I just wanted to say all those words on a podcast.
1467564	1468125	No, it doesn't.
1469146	1471028	It's the mods that put that on there.
1472826	1477929	I think there's a big, big difference between what's going on here and what's going on with Grand Theft Auto.
1478509	1483631	I call what happened with Grand Theft Auto, San Andreas, and the whole hot coffee thing lazy programming.
1483951	1487513	The reason being, and we've seen this happen before with DDR.
1489723	1494766	Because we, you know, DarkSakura, Loki, myself, have been talking about DDR for years, so we've been following the franchise.
1495167	1506394	And when it had a release on the PlayStation, its very first release, some hackers found on the disc a background for the song Bad Girls where somebody had airbrushed out the gun.
1506754	1510296	So it makes it look like that they had prepped that song to be ready for U.S.
1510396	1512958	audiences, but they took the song out at the last minute.
1513118	1520062	Or if you even want to go more recent, DDR Extreme, where they had a completely, a song that wasn't even in the game, but you could play it.
1520122	1521903	That's right, you had Memories, remember that?
1521963	1528566	Memories is completely in the game, and with hack codes, you could hack your memory card file to play Memories on DDR Extreme.
1528886	1532487	Even though the song wasn't supposed to be there for whatever reason at the last minute they took it out.
1532987	1534027	But what did they take out?
1534948	1542329	It's a pain in the butt, I guess for compiling or whatever reasons, I'm not a programmer, but it's a pain in the butt to take out the entire chunk of game.
1542689	1549391	It's easier to take out the little pointer that points to that file because all these games work on a giant flowchart.
1549751	1552353	It's easier to take out the pointer that says play this song.
1552693	1563241	So that's what I think happened with Grand Theft Auto, that Rockstar had every intention of doing this sex thing, but at the last minute somebody thought, you know what, maybe this is a little much.
1563762	1566884	So instead of taking the whole thing out of the game, what did they take out?
1566984	1568045	They took out the pointer.
1568485	1572969	and when the PC version came out, it was exposed that the hot coffee thing was in there.
1573270	1579636	Somebody put the pointer back in and sure enough, PlayStation and Xbox versions, the pointers, they figure out how to put them back in.
1579956	1585281	Rockstar has to admit, yes, the sex thing was in the game the whole time but they didn't intend on it being discovered.
1585761	1589286	And I believe it, that they probably had taken the pointers out, not realizing.
1589746	1591188	It's lazy programming, I call it.
1591829	1596255	So, but now with the Sims, that's not, you don't have a pointer, or at least with the Sims 2.
1596855	1602623	Rumor is in the original Sims, and I didn't play enough of the Sims, but that there actually was a code where you could undo the blur or whatever.
1602703	1603504	That's a patch.
1603744	1604385	It's another mod.
1604785	1608587	But the thing is that even under the blur, there was no detail.
1609367	1611608	All it is is another skin that has the detail.
1611788	1611988	Right.
1612368	1614689	And even there was actually a quote.
1614769	1618751	Jeff Brown, Vice President of Corporate Communications at EA, says, This is nonsense.
1619051	1620712	We reviewed 100% of the content.
1620732	1623293	There is no content inappropriate for a teen audience.
1623593	1625134	Players never see a nude sim.
1625454	1631336	If someone with an extreme amount of expertise and time were to remove the pixels, they would see that the sims have no genitals.
1631376	1632857	They appear like Ken and Barbie.
1632877	1632977	Right.
1633197	1641959	What they're talking about, though, is the nude sim patches where people have actually modified, because in The Sims 2, you can actually modify your character, and so they added that stuff in.
1642219	1646299	But the thing is, and this guy's like going, oh, well, they're just letting that happen.
1646399	1657281	Yeah, they want people to make mods so you can make new clothing, you can make new items, etc., because that stuff, they have whole communities built around that where you can buy new skins, you can make characters that look like Austin Powers, etc.
1657361	1661702	On The Sims 2 site themselves, they offer a mod of the month, basically.
1661842	1662042	Right.
1662442	1664903	They would not highlight a nude patch as the mod of the month.
1664943	1666084	They have that kind of case.
1666424	1667385	And they have houses.
1667425	1670026	You can buy houses and bring them in or whatever.
1670186	1672467	But that same thing's been going on for years.
1672567	1673488	Remember Tomb Raider?
1673508	1676409	They had the nude Laura patch within six months of the game coming out.
1676789	1678270	And where was this guy then?
1678350	1679290	He doesn't do his research.
1679330	1680591	That's clearly what it is.
1680671	1681672	He doesn't do his research.
1681712	1682872	So take this one to court.
1682912	1684533	They're going to nail you in the ass.
1684633	1686135	I think that's what they're going to find the difference is.
1686196	1689561	And I hope somebody sits down in front of Congress and explains this to them.
1689802	1693287	You can't control what the people on the internet are going to do to the code of the game.
1694349	1697615	But in the case of Grand Theft Auto, I think it was a lazy pointer programming thing.
1698143	1704687	But even still, if that was the case, this shouldn't have even gone as far as it was, even if it was lazy programming.
1705027	1706848	Because it's stupid.
1707028	1707749	It's really dumb.
1707869	1718855	I think all games are going to suffer because of this, not necessarily content-wise, but programmers aren't going to be so lazy anymore, and they're going to push back the release dates of their games so they can clean out the code so you people don't find them.
1718875	1719795	You know what's going to suffer?
1720296	1720976	Free expression.
1721556	1722377	That's what's going to suffer.
1723151	1727272	You know, it's kind of funny though, because there are a lot of lazy programmers out there.
1728132	1738936	One of the Dance Dance Revolution games, they sometimes used to have these things like dummy files that they would put on the disc to fill up space or whatever, so it would make them harder to rip or whatever.
1739896	1746018	One of the Dance Dance Revolution games, I think it was Max 2, had the entire source code for Beatmania 5 on it.
1747874	1748994	Oh, I'd heard about that.
1776234	1777336	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1794474	1796536	DarkSakura, what's going on in the UK for our friends overseas?
1796556	1798257	Well, actually this is more of an international thing.
1822632	1849772	About Hironobu Sakaguchi, you know, Final Fantasy creator Basically is saying that he's got a couple games in works on the Xbox 360 However, they will not be playable at the Tokyo Game Show in September Oh, interesting But they are basically making progress on it They're getting the graphics in order It's just been slow progress What about Final Fantasy XII, dammit?
1851478	1858600	Also in news, Archer McLean, he was the creative director at Awesome Studios.
1859500	1861321	They actually were the company that put out Mercury.
1861581	1862021	He resigned.
1862941	1867583	But said that overall he was really more of a figurehead, so it's not really a major loss.
1868703	1874284	And Loki, your review on Mercury pretty much convinced me not to buy the game, so I guess this is no big loss.
1874605	1875985	It wasn't that great of a game.
1876045	1876705	It was okay.
1876725	1879846	It was sort of different, but I got bored with it really quick.
1880031	1881912	What could they have done to make the game better?
1882292	1884393	I was expecting something sort of like Marble Madness.
1884513	1891557	The mazes were too short, and it was just very... A lot of levels, they were really short, and it just didn't do it for me.
1891657	1892778	It was just kind of a pain in the butt.
1894244	1897947	Now, the last thing is a game I haven't heard much on coming up for the U.S.
1898007	1898367	market.
1898987	1902470	I'm sure it will, but it's called Another Code, Two Memories.
1903471	1907293	Basically, it's sort of like a combination of an interactive sim.
1907313	1915919	It's kind of like the dating sims were, except you also have a little map where you guide somebody through a house, and you have puzzles to get them through this house.
1916280	1919062	So you're using both screens, one for your communication with a ghost,
1919702	1921303	and the other to navigate.
1921843	1925385	So it's supposed to be a little semi-survival horror puzzle game.
1926205	1926906	It looks pretty cool.
1928026	1928487	Very cool.
1928867	1929287	Sounds good.
1930528	1930928	All right.
1932309	1935470	Let's move on to some other news, talking about Xbox Live.
1936291	1939552	There was actually a story posted on, I'm not sure if this is Gamasutra.
1939912	1942694	I always want to say Gamasutra so it can rhyme with the book, you know.
1943674	1944735	But I think it's Gamasutra.
1945470	1952637	They ran a story earlier this week that says that Microsoft is announcing 2 million Xbox Live subscribers.
1952717	1955320	The last time that they had made an announcement was back in January.
1955881	1958063	1.4 million users at that point.
1958904	1964991	This growth rate, by the way, would be the equivalent of one new Xbox Live member every 30 seconds.
1965792	1967013	I'm kind of surprised that
1968868	1970688	Xbox Live is still growing so rapidly.
1970728	1972849	But I guess Halo 2 has a large part to do with that.
1972869	1977292	But it just doesn't seem like there's been a whole lot of... The hype of the 360.
1978012	1982434	Also, some of the new games include the free two-month trial as well.
1982794	1985816	Like, Abident Rising had two-month trial in it.
1985876	1986556	Okay, I could see that.
1986576	1991718	And plus, with the console coming down in price, it makes Xbox... Like, I didn't buy Xbox when it was first out.
1991758	1994860	It wasn't until they slashed them to $200 when I finally decided to pick one up.
1995520	1997722	So I guess that helps kind of motivate sales as well.
1998222	1998783	Very interesting.
1999903	2007709	By the way, also in this article, the company mentions what titles are going to be out for Xbox Live and Xbox 360 Live that will be out before the end of the year.
2008469	2019297	Online playable titles for Xbox 360 include Perfect Dark Zero, Project Gotham Racing 3, Madden NFL 06, Dead or Alive 4, and Call of Duty 2.
2020598	2023740	Some games for the current Xbox that will be enabled on Xbox Live
2024085	2030032	Star Wars Battlefront 2, Tony Hawk American Wasteland, Battlefield 2, Modern Combat.
2030072	2034657	So for those Xbox fans, a lot of sequels in there, so some games to look forward to.
2035338	2036519	I think Dead or Alive will be cool.
2036719	2037100	Dead or Alive 4.
2037140	2038802	American Wasteland is going to be pretty cool too.
2039382	2041705	It's like Tony Hawk Underground, but free roaming.
2042246	2042406	It's
2043139	2044000	All one huge level.
2044341	2046705	Some of those clips of Dead or Alive 4, though, look so great.
2046725	2050933	And I've not usually been a really huge Dead or Alive fan, but Dead or Alive 4 looked pretty hot.
2050953	2052596	I want to see the Dead or Alive movie.
2053518	2053818	Alright.
2054860	2055301	Moving on.
2056423	2059745	Also another game being teased this week, Resident Evil 5.
2060726	2069051	The website Gamefront had some scans of the publication, Famitsu, which gave some news this week on Resident Evil 5.
2069111	2074854	The interesting thing about Resident Evil 5, remember how Resident Evil 4 was GameCube only, at least in the beginning?
2075295	2080938	Resident Evil 5 will only be on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 when it first comes out.
2081218	2082459	Nintendo's getting the shaft.
2082759	2085961	But I say this is because Nintendo is being so secretive with their revolutions.
2086021	2087582	Yeah, because they haven't released their system yet.
2087602	2090502	The system's like, uh... It'll come out sometime.
2090903	2104607	I have a feeling Resident Evil 5 will make its way to the Revolution, but because Nintendo is releasing it later... Well, honestly, I haven't even heard if the Nintendo Revolution dev kits have even gone out yet, so... Well, you can't really make a game without that, so... Well...
2105548	2106229	Very interesting.
2106249	2107790	They also have the trailer up for this, too.
2108051	2108611	Looked pretty cool.
2109332	2118460	Speculation from the early screenshots say that Chris Redfield, who was in Resident Evil 1 and Code Veronica, looks to be the main character in this next game.
2119361	2126728	It looks like the over-the-shoulder style from Resident Evil 4 will be coming back in this game as well, at least in some way.
2127389	2130932	But what was surprising from the early screenshots, the game appears to be a little brighter.
2132008	2132949	Thank you for watching!
2152602	2154103	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2181352	2193448	Acetaminophen can cause liver damage in conjunction with alcohol, Ibuprofen can cause severe stomach irritation, and Aspirin thins the blood, which may exacerbate hangover.
2193828	2194950	Sorry again for talking too fast.
2195849	2196870	2.
2195909	2196870	Drink a lot of fluids.
2196930	2200672	Dehydration from alcohol can be treated with water, sweet juices, or sports drinks.
2201413	2205055	Potassium also helps you overcome shaky feeling of a bad hangover.
2205075	2205055	3.
2206256	2206937	Take vitamins.
2207037	2210959	A good multivitamin or vitamin B complex can be used to combat vitamin depletion.
2211360	2213861	And when you drink, vitamin B is the first thing to go.
2215242	2213861	4.
2215523	2216363	Eat starchy food.
2216443	2218104	Lots of it.
2218124	2218104	5.
2218525	2220566	Rest or sleep for as long as possible.
2221647	2220566	6.
2221867	2224689	Repeat steps 2 through 5 if you wake up with a hangover.
2225433	2230696	But my number one bit of advice on how to sober up fast, don't go to any Rob's parties.
2233158	2236640	Don't use the double shot glass to make double shot drinks.
2237160	2237721	Thanks, guys.
2237741	2238521	Appreciate your support.
2239261	2239602	All right.
2240842	2241263	You know what?
2241283	2243164	Just for that, you get a story about UE Bowl.
2244365	2245005	Just for that.
2246246	2248808	Dungeon Siege is the next movie that's going to be coming out.
2249228	2252790	Ray Liotta was just signed for Dungeon Siege the movie.
2252830	2255372	He'll be playing a villainous character in the game.
2255872	2256713	That's his title.
2257894	2260195	Die, villainous character, die.
2260315	2263317	Isn't the name of the main character Farmer or something like that?
2264658	2265479	That's kind of dorky.
2266179	2270722	It could be like what in the Trogdor game, Peasant's Quest.
2271803	2272984	That's enough about Yui Bol.
2273364	2275065	Loki, what's going on in the hack and crack scene?
2275586	2279128	Well, there's some interesting stuff that should put a damper on the homebrew scene.
2280168	2289593	PSP Firmware 2.0 was announced at the PlayStation Conference just this week, and PlayStation 2.0 will be adding the elusive internet browser.
2289673	2293235	That's right, folks, you can actually build a browsing internet without having to have Wipeout.
2293535	2294436	So, let me think.
2294596	2302940	Sony realized that people were hacking their way into getting a web browser, so they thought, gee, a good idea to curb this would be to just release our own web browser.
2303280	2303520	DarkSakura
2322810	2323491	Thanks for watching!
2336633	2340515	Download our podcast without having to do anything special.
2341015	2342796	Find a Wi-Fi spot, download podcast.
2342917	2343117	Go!
2343337	2344057	Very interesting.
2344077	2347999	Ooh, an iPod-er for the PSP would be cool.
2348480	2349000	Very cool.
2349800	2353182	What I'm wondering, is this only in Japan or is this actually going to happen here, the TV thing?
2353703	2355644	The TV thing right now I think is only in Japan.
2355764	2359326	The version 2.0 is supposed to launch in Japan on July 27th.
2360186	2360726	So next week.
2361247	2368910	And also, they're going to be launching a brand new color PSP, white, which is coming out September 21st.
2368950	2369791	Virginal white.
2370811	2371652	Ceramic white.
2371812	2372292	I'm sorry.
2372612	2373993	And it's going to be coming out.
2374073	2376874	It's going to be with firmware 2.0 on there.
2377294	2381156	So you can't run the homebrew games, but you've got an internet browser.
2381596	2383818	But how long before they hack the 2.0, you think?
2384878	2385518	Oh, it's gone.
2385598	2391541	What they're going to do is they're going to take the firmware update, rip the browser right out of there, and it'll be in there.
2392641	2401345	New applications are coming along, though, because they accidentally revealed Firmware 2.0 on the internet, and some people downloaded it, and it crashed their PSPs.
2402145	2406587	But they're going to be having a calculator, a word processor, and I think a day planner.
2406767	2408167	A word processor on your PSP?
2408187	2409308	Word processor.
2410157	2413318	Well, the thing is... That means there has to be a keyboard attachment coming out.
2413338	2414938	Yeah, that's what I was just about to say.
2415018	2421660	Keyboard support is now being added with the PSP, I think via their IR or a USB adapter type thing.
2422180	2423621	So there's going to be a PSP keyboard coming out.
2423941	2426582	Okay, so that's all the wonderful official stuff that's going on.
2426622	2429623	Of course, we don't really want to know about the official stuff.
2429663	2433084	We want to talk about... Well, I found the official stuff to be interesting, for one.
2433144	2434024	Okay, fine.
2434084	2435184	Talk about the unofficial stuff.
2435204	2436024	The unofficial stuff.
2436665	2437705	Brand new loaders have been...
2439265	2443768	We are back group has released another loader.
2443828	2456094	These ones bypassing the update checks and now running over clock stuff and running the full library files so you can have all this wonderful Wi-Fi and music and everything.
2457463	2461325	Only a matter of time before 3.0 comes out and everything runs.
2461905	2462745	It's not going to matter anymore.
2463466	2465386	So I just thought I'd mention that.
2465566	2468388	Also, upgrades to your favorite emulators.
2468888	2471549	Super Nintendo 9X is now running almost full speed.
2472209	2473090	Ooh, I gotta check that out.
2473230	2474430	Yeah, that's really awesome.
2474450	2475931	I mean, for research purposes only.
2476251	2478492	Well, homebrew stuff I don't think is a problem, but anyways.
2478912	2482333	I'll check it out for playing Seiken Densetsu 3 on the PSP.
2483114	2483574	Exactly.
2483754	2485555	And my personal favorite, the
2486562	2514303	Scum version 3.0 or version 3's come out which can run Monkey Island and stuff so if you have the old Monkey Island game like I do I have a CD somewhere out there for it I can copy it over and play it on my PSP and Loom I love Loom I was playing this one though called I don't remember what it's called the initials are B-A-S-S anyways it was an okay game but it ran really well I was surprised for emulating a PC game runs great
2514718	2516159	You know, I found my copy of Loom.
2517139	2517359	Really?
2517379	2518620	I was going to install it and play it.
2519020	2521201	Was Maniac Mansion on that same software?
2522802	2524002	The Day of the Tentacle was.
2524362	2525403	Ah, that's where I'm getting confused.
2525443	2526003	Day of the Tentacle was.
2526023	2527944	But Maniac Mansion played on the NES emulator.
2528364	2528724	Good point.
2529144	2533266	And finally, the last thing I'd say is PSP Paint version 3 is out.
2533506	2536408	So I made a cool little picture and it's not really good.
2536428	2537568	But you can save your pictures now.
2537768	2541930	Yes, I saw your lovely interpretation of Grand Theft Auto that you had painted in there.
2542430	2543591	GTA made me kill.
2544662	2545042	All right.
2545803	2549865	One more story for you guys tonight, and it has to do with the resurrection of Acclaim.
2549925	2554708	Yeah, somebody is going to be zombifying Acclaim by injecting it full of Worcester sauce.
2554788	2554929	No.
2555449	2561733	Actually, what's going to be happening is that Central Investment Holdings is trying to sell the rights.
2562936	2563997	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2586417	2586857	DarkSakura
2615312	2616412	Oh, yeah.
2616972	2617833	Reject false icons.
2618773	2622115	My final thought is, you are the ones who are the ball lickers.
2624156	2627157	And that was the little poster that made a cameo appearance in the news article.
2627797	2631799	What was blurred out like the genitalia on a sim?
2632920	2633720	Good night, everybody.
2633740	2636001	We'll see you next time on the Orange Lounge Radio to-go edition.
2637492	2641080	That's the end of another Orange Lounge Radio To Go edition.
