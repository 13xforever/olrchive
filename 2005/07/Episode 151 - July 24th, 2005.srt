1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,480
Think twice about love

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:41,840
Windmill, windmill for the land Love forever, hand in hand

3
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:48,800
Take it or lay it on your stride It is taking for all in land

4
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:55,680
Love forever, love is free Let's turn forever, you and me

5
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:03,280
Windmill, windmill for the land it's everybody in

6
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,000
Go shop, shitty dudes

7
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,180
Sleep by your cab, little city watching Savagrid

8
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:14,920
Go shop, shitty dudes

9
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,960
Levi, the captain said his baby wants to travel big

10
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,960

11
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:49,820

12
00:01:49,820 --> 00:02:06,020

13
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:12,540
It is time for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio on tonight's program.

14
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:16,480
We're going to talk about another podcast that we fully endorse that you all should

00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,080
This should be interesting.

19
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,480
This is brand new, by the way.

20
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,520
I have not even looked at this, well, I saw it when it was on TV, but I have not looked

21
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,880
at the digitized format of it, so we're going to check that out very soon.

22
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:39,360
And remember, kids, podcasting is fun.

23
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:46,360
We'll be back after this.

24
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,360
Oh, my god.

25
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,360
Oh, god.

00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,360

32

33
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,360

38
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:55,600
You're tuned in to Orange Lounge Radio, radio that gamers really want, and this is Orange

39
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,860
Lounge Radio Live.

40
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:00,780
home for all the news and discussion on rhythm and music games as well as the

41
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:04,900
gamer community and the pop culture world. We're plugged in and fully

42
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:11,260
interactive through our website at www.orangeloungeradio.com. My name is Rob

43
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:15,740
Roberts, you might know me as Sky. Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts. In

44
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:19,980
this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm, Miss Jamie Summers, also known as

45
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:28,460
dark Sakura actually she's not here she's uh she's running a little late

46
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:31,580
tonight she had some family business she had to take care of hopefully

47
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:35,380
everything's okay but she's going to be here a little bit later on just you know

48
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:42,080
however we do have the one and only Loki I am here and not in the cushion

49
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,220
obviously that was very good timing by the way finding your microphone well

50
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:50,220
Well, Jamie should be sitting on both of the microphones then.

51
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:54,220
I'm not sure. It probably got put there during the party last night. We had a little bit of a house party last night.

52
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:58,220
Maybe I shouldn't be talking with this microphone against my mouth.

53
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:02,220
Is that the loud sensitive one?

54
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:06,220
I don't know. Who knows? No? Anyway. Alright. So, Loki's here and then

55
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:10,220
special guest wise we have nobody. I don't know. What the hell happened?

56
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:14,220
We used to have special guests here every single week. There'd be somebody here and lately

57
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:18,220
Nobody loves us anymore. Is it because we're in this new place? I don't get it.

58
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:21,220
Something's weird. Can they give him bad directions?

59
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:25,220
I guess so. It's like I lied to him about where I live or something. I don't know.

60
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:30,220
Oh well. Fine. See if we care. We'll just sit here and do the show ourselves.

61
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:32,220
So we have some fun stuff to talk about tonight.

62
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:37,220
We were famous this week. Well, you know, we're always famous.

63
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:42,220
No, we were on local news this week, so we have to show that clip later in the show.

64
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:46,380
the show which makes for great radio by the way showing video clips but even the

65
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:52,700
audio of it's gonna be pretty funny Loki's bit in it is priceless love it so

66
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:56,020
we'll be airing that for you guys and telling you guys how you can get a copy

67
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:59,660
of the video because some of you guys are asking just like publish media to

68
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:04,940

00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:10,660

70
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,460
Yeah, we'll get to that a little later.

71
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,860
Also, we gotta talk about our buddy Midihead.

72
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:18,060
He's been doing some fun stuff this week.

73
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,900
And we'll play a little clip of his new UltraMix 3 song, too.

74
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,540
I don't wanna play the whole thing,

75
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,360
cause people gotta go check this thing out

76
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,380
where you are supposed to be getting it,

77
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,820
but we'll play a little clip of the new UltraMix 3 song

78
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:29,660
for those that haven't heard it.

79
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,180
It'll be fun.

80
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,260
So, we'll be back after this little break.

81
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,260
In this break, since I just woke up from a nap,

82
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,840
I thought I'd play some really annoying,

83
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,820
fast music that'll wake me up.

84
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:42,820
So we're going to start it off with Cartoon Heroes, one of the most annoying songs I could think of.

85
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:46,340
Enjoy, kids! We'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.

86
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:17,820
We do the things you want to be, brain by brain, to the X-rays

87
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:23,820
Our friends are so unreasonable, they do the unpredictable

88
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:29,820
All out alive if we can say what we do and what we wish to do

89
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:34,820
There's no line or best for our friends, do it all through the end of the day

90
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:40,820
Brain by brain to the X-rays, one by one, we're making it fun

91
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:46,620
We are the stars, you're heroes of the world We are the ones who fall in love and fall in love

92
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,820
We're singing by your back, raise your mind

93
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:52,220
Oh, the ones that are bad, they are the ones that are bad

94
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:55,220
You can't fight back, we're running from the other side

95
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:57,820

00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:46,420
This is your night, you make me cry I need to lighten up, save my life

People give you my life in music You've been waiting tonight, you're crazy

There's a devotion, and if I dance, I'll kiss you every night

105
00:11:48,820 --> 00:12:16,820
New York City lights New York City lights

This is life

107

We love America

108
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,820
That's a practical place

109
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:21,820
Can't you see me now?

Bang, bang, bang

120
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:35,820
We're living in the old

121
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,820
Don't laugh at my hand

122
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:17,820
I'm at the

123
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:41,820
Living in America

124
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,820
Living in America

125
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:44,820
This is never

126
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:44,680
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

127
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:52,000
I think I threw up in my mouth a little bit during that last break, and we had some vomit-inducing

128
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
songs.

129
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,120
Admit it, there's at least one song you hated in that last break.

130
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,360
I think during that break, we'd have people in the chat room be like, oh, I love that

131
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,880
song, and then there'd be other people going, god, I hate that song, and then during the

132
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:06,680
next song, it would switch around.

133
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:13,040
Cartoon Heroes by Barbie Young, Speed Over Beethoven by Rose, Nori Nori Nori, Judy Crystal,

134
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:17,320
Living in America from DDR Max 2 and I don't remember the artist on that cuz

135
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:21,200
I'm too lazy to look it up and I never play that song so I don't remember oh

136
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:27,280
well anyway um so we're here with another show oh hello

137
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:33,920
there's the lovely Dark Sakura she's here and we were about ready to chat

138
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,240
about what's going on in the Bamani world actually before that though we

139
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,800
always have to start off each week show with a little bit of how was your week

140
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:44,800
How was your day? And DarkSakura just joined us. She usually starts us off, so...

141
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,800
I'd rather not talk about my week, thanks.

142
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,800
Okay. Well, then we'll move on to Loki.

143
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,800
My week was hot. That's hot.

144
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:59,800
No, it's because the air conditioning is broken for a week, so that sucked.

145
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,800
But I have a house that the dog, my mom's dog, and that sucked also.

146
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:15,800
And, um, what else? Oh, just a lot of sucking. Um, basically, you know, staying at my mom's house sucked because she is on dial-up and no one likes dial-up.

147
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:23,800
And also the fact that the dog, you know, wants constant attention all the time, including at three in the morning, and it's just, you know, very tiring.

148
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:27,800
And then I finally get home, you know, on Friday, you know, okay, I'm done finally.

149
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:32,960
you know the the apartment complexes had a week to fix the you know AC nope nope

150
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:37,720
nope they're not done yet they're not gonna be done till Monday so all weekend

151
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:41,200
it's been like 95 degrees in the apartment what are they having to do for

152
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:45,440
your AC they replace the whole thing the whole entire unit and then they said

153
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,520
they clogged something so they've got to do something on Jesus and I'm like oh

154
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:53,520
my god fucking retarded you know what your situation is starting to sound like

155
00:15:53,520 --> 00:16:00,160
the plot of Dark Water whether they have a bad AC there no but it has to do with

156
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,760
a mold spot on the seal I don't want to say too much about the plot but the

157
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:07,080
trailer gives this part away so I can say that it's about this mold spot

158
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:12,720
that's growing on the ceiling and the the people don't fix it the landlords

159
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,200
and then when they finally do like it won't go away and it's still a problem

160
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,520
and then there's this whole you know plot going on I think it's about more

161
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:27,220
than a mold spot it is but that's what they try to get the scares with mold you

162
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:32,980
know cuz that killer mold the black mold it's always got to be the black mold you

163
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:41,060
know what they got against the black mold so yeah basically it sucked a lot

164
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:49,100
and then I don't know then the rest of the week was just basically you know

165
00:16:49,100 --> 00:17:01,500
of work stuff, playing PSP, played more Killer7, and that type of thing. Yeah. That's it.

166
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:07,100
My week and my day was okay. Nothing to scream about, really. It's been very hot here in

167
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:13,900
the city, so it makes you not want to go out and do a lot. I went and saw Charlie and the

168
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:18,500
Chocolate Factory for the second time. That was pretty cool, because that movie rocks.

169
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:24,740
And I went to this restaurant called the Cheesecake Factory, and this is for my roommate's birthday.

170
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:28,380
And this place is very, very expensive, and it's kind of known around town for having

171
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,820
a very, very long wait.

172
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:32,900
I can't remember if this place is a national chain or if it's something on the west coast.

173
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:33,900
I know they have more...

174
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:34,900
Is it national?

175
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,540
Okay, then they've got one of these probably near you somewhere.

176
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:38,540
I've never been before.

177
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:40,020
It's brand new in this part of town.

178
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,660
They have crappy pizza there.

179
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:44,380
I have never had the pizza, but the food in general...

180
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:45,860
You have the orange chicken.

181
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:50,040
I actually had the orange chicken and to be honest I wasn't a fan of the orange chicken

182
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:55,480
because I felt like I was paying 14 bucks for the orange chicken here and I could pay

183
00:17:55,480 --> 00:18:01,080
like 6 bucks over at the little Mon Pod Chinese restaurant and the orange chicken was just

184
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,900
as good if not better.

185
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:06,000
So it was one of those things where like okay well you're paying for atmosphere but the

186
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,960
host that we had was kind of a doof.

187
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,120
He just, I don't know.

188
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:16,560
So luckily the cheesecake itself was really, really good, so at least, you know, if you're

189
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:20,140
going to call your restaurant the Cheesecake Factory, you should have good cheesecake.

190
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,140
And that they did.

191
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:25,100
So I forgive them for at least having subpar as their food.

192
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:30,980
But still, the bill being quite a large amount of money for three people, I just, I expected

193
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:31,980
more.

194
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:32,980
I don't know.

195
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,380
I wanted, like, showgirls dancing or something.

196
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,260
It just, I expected more.

197
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:40,620
Our waitress at the San Francisco restaurant juggled ketchup packets.

198
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:44,580
she earned her tip. Where was this at? The San Diego one is really the best one I've

199
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:51,500
been to. It's in San Francisco. It's on the top of Macy's. It's on the thirteenth floor

200
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:56,860
or something like that. Awesome. And basically you can go walk over and look at the balcony

201
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:03,220
and stuff on top of the roof there. They had some stupid Christian thing going on after

202
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:07,220
through the gay pride parade, so they equal everything out.

203
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:13,820
In response to what DarkSakura said about the San Diego one

204
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,900
being better, I've heard the San Francisco one is better, too.

205
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,180
So maybe it's just our Cheesecake Factory.

206
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,980
But our Cheesecake Factory, something's wrong.

207
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,780
Something's clogged.

208
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,460
They've got a mold problem or something.

209
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:23,980
I don't know.

210
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:26,420
But something is not right at the Cheesecake Factory

211
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:29,100
here in lovely Sacramento, California.

212
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:34,860
So, what do you want to talk about first? Do you want to talk about us and the news,

213
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:38,200
or do you want to talk about other actual Bomani news?

214
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,260
Us, of course. Okay, you want to talk about us? So, we were

215
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:47,460
on the news this week. They came out to do a story – where were they out here? Monday?

216
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:50,460
Yeah. They were out here Monday. Actually, they

217
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:53,260
were out here originally on Friday – or they were supposed to be out here originally

218
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:57,740
on Friday, but real news happened somewhere, so we got pushed back – we got bumped to

219
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:04,460
day, but they were out here and the reporter guy was very, very nice, and the cameraman,

220
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:07,700
they actually stayed quite a while. They were probably here for about an hour just filming

221
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:13,700
different things. They filmed interviews with all three of us, and then they filmed us playing

222
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:16,180
DDR on my new TV, which was pretty cool.

223
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:21,740
Just always a bad sign. Yeah, I've got a note here that says I've got to take a picture

224
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:28,340
of you guys, um, playing DDR. What does that have to do with our show? Uh, nothing. But,

225
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:33,960
uh, yeah, I'm supposed to do that. Always a bad sign. You're just bitter because your

226
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:40,100
feet always somehow end up in it somehow, so. Because last time, we did our research

227
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:46,780
a lot. You guys played during the show, don't ya? Don't ya? Don't ya? Don't ya? No, ya idiot!

228
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:52,340
We do not. We have. We did like twice. We did the Xbox Live tournament online, which

229
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:58,540
nobody showed up for. Remember we were going to have our big gala 16 person DDR online

230
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:02,980
tournament and then like four people showed up? I don't remember anything about that.

231
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:06,980
It must have been a week you weren't here or something. Probably. It was. You remember

232
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:12,220
this, right? It was an impromptu, it was when we were unveiling Ultramix 2 or something

233
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:16,160
like that. That's what it was. It was one of those unveiling shows. And we tried to

234
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,840
to get all these people to come and only four people shut up,

235
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,040
which shows you how many people listen to this program.

236
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,720
I mean, how many people are on Xbox Live and Lucy

237
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,280
in the program?

238
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:27,920
Whatever.

239
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,800
And have older makes, too.

240
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,160
I don't know.

241
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,840
I guess not that many, but we'll see.

242
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,300
So we tried to do that, and it failed miserably.

243
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:36,200
But we have done the play DDR thing on the show before.

244
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,520
It's just not the focus about our show.

245
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:41,600
I guess, you know, and we do talk about DDR,

246
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,160
and we talk about 2DX in the show.

247
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,860
So I see where they get that impression.

248
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:47,360
The playing DDR on the show was a little crazy.

249
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,860
Apparently we talk about it on the podcast, too.

250
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:53,360
Yeah, so then they were doing a story on the podcast,

251
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,860
and since DDR is kind of our roots, they wanted us to show us playing DDR.

252
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:57,860
So whatever, that's cool.

253
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:00,360
Because that's what our podcast is about, isn't it?

254
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,360
Because that's the impression I got from the interview,

255
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,860
because they seem to know more about our show than we do, because...

256
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:09,860
No, no, I'm not going to knock on it, because beggars can't be choosers,

257
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:10,860
and it was nice.

258
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:11,860
Fine, I will then.

259
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:12,860
All right, fine.

260
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:16,940
enough talk let's just play the damn thing is dark soccer you actually

261
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:18,060
haven't seen this yet right

262
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:21,140
no I was stuck singing karaoke

263
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:24,700
alright so so dark soccer is gonna get to see this for the very first time so

264
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:25,340
here we go

265
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:29,500
I don't want anybody to see me though too late too late you were on the news

266
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:35,820
too damn late I needed to ask to be pixelated and have them spell my name right

267
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:39,820
maybe I should have been a spokesperson because that's the only way I'm gonna get on air

268
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:43,180
You can't, when you see what they did to Loki,

269
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:45,940
Extrofer, my roommate and I, laughed until we peed.

270
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,580
It was so funny.

271
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:48,860
All right, here we go.

272
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:51,580
Fuck.

273
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:54,100
Told the governor is one of the many people joining the

274
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:57,780
podcasting craze that's becoming a web craze, but

275
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:58,340
what is it?

276
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:59,020
How does it work?

277
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:02,020
KCRA Free's Brian Hickey tonight shows us how people

278
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:05,260
are using podcasting to inform, entertain, and share

279
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:07,180
their thoughts with the world.

280
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:12,420
By the way, this report comes from a local news station, Channel 3, and the reporter

281
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:13,420
was very nice.

282
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:14,420
He was a very nice man.

283
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:15,420
I liked him.

284
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:16,420
He was good.

285
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:20,020
And he had done his research because I was very impressed with what he did know about

286
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:21,820
the station before he came here.

287
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:25,180
Of course, I know he'd been talking to you quite a bit, so you probably filled him in

288
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:26,180
on all that.

289
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,180
Of course!

290
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:30,980
When they headed off to the editors, all hell breaks loose.

291
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:35,820
Hold on, hold on.

292
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,820
There's Jamie playing DDR.

293
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:47,820
It started off tiny and it's grown.

294
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:53,820
It started off tiny and it's grown.

295
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:58,820
If I didn't know you were talking about a podcast there, I could sell my clips to Blackmail.

296
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:03,820
I already used a little bit of attention.

297
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:05,620
And there's us sitting in the room.

298
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:09,220
I would like to point out that they may not realize it, but look what they're showing

299
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,220
in the background.

300
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:11,760
Did they blur that out?

301
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,760
I can't tell.

302
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,900
But they're too far away.

303
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:17,940
There's the Jay and Silent Bob poster, which hangs here in the studio.

304
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,660
We have a Jay and Silent Bob poster.

305
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:22,300
And I quote, all you motherfuckers are going to pay.

306
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,900
You are the ones who are the ball lickers.

307
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:27,460
We're going to fuck your mothers while you watch and cry like little whiny bitches.

308
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:30,500
Once we get to Hollywood and find those Miramax fucks who's making the movie, we're going

309
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:34,280
to make them eat our shit, then shit out our shit, then eat their shit, which is made up

310
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:38,800
of our shit that we made them eat. And then all you motherfuckers are next. Love James

311
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:43,640
Obama. You can actually see that poster in the background a little bit.

312
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:46,680
Emily digressed a bit. Let's go ahead and keep going.

313
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,640
Sorry. I don't look hideous.

314
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:53,020
Look, if we could get the word fuck on the news in any way, shape, or form, I think that's

315
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:56,000
worth a comment. We've done our job.

316
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
All right, here we go, moving on.

317
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,680
We should report ourselves to the MPAA or whatever.

318
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,680
Let me roll it back a little.

319
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,240
Yeah, we're going to have to re-rate our show adults only.

320
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,240
Hold on.

321
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:09,200
A subculture of pop culture, and these are the voices to unite and inform the gaming

322
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,200
fans.

323
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,200
And, where am I?

324
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,200
Dark Sakura, Sky, and Low.

325
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,200
Okay, stop, stop.

326
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,200
I would like to note, where am I?

327
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,200
Oh, they're on my feet!

328
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,200
But where am I?

329
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,200
Oh, that's right.

330
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,200
They cut me behind the goddamn door.

331
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,200
Fucking stupid.

332
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:24,200
Oh, they're on my feet! But where am I? Oh, that's right, they cut me behind the goddamn door!

333
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:31,200
Fucking stupid people! I can't shoot film for crap! Hello? I mean, they can say, okay, if the guy says,

334
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:37,200
Hey, I can't see you, move your ass out into the fucking light so we can get a picture of you because you're behind the door!

335
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:43,200
Let me- Okay, since this is a video that we're playing on the radio right now, let me set this up for the people who are listening right now, why Loki is so angry.

336
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,300
angry. They're showing a shot of all three of us doing the show, and you can clearly

337
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:49,980
see Dark Sakura in the big comfy green chair.

338
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:51,500
I'm not supposed to be seen.

339
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:55,980
And you can see me doing the chatting. And then you see Loki's feet dangling and his

340
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:59,060
belly kind of hanging out from behind the corner.

341
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:02,260
I look so short. My feet don't touch the ground.

342
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:05,860
And when they say, when they say, you're right, your feet are dangling.

343
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:07,260
Look! Look at my feet!

344
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:09,540
You look like you're sitting in Santa's lap.

345
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:12,060
Uh, no.

346
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:16,900
when they go, these are the faces of Orange Lounge Radio. They show Jamie, they show me,

347
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:24,220
and then they cut to another picture. Yeah, because I have a face for radio, apparently.

348
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:27,440
And those of you guys that are complaining that you can't see this, you will eventually.

349
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:32,100
We're working on, it's just a bandwidth thing right now, but we're going to get it uploaded

350
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:36,540
sometime tonight, so you guys will have it by tomorrow. But anyone, here we go. Let me

351
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:49,500
Let me finish the story here.

352
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,780
And apparently we all live in the same apartment.

353
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:52,780
By the way.

354
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:53,780
I look horrible.

355
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:54,780
I look horrible.

356
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:55,780
Get!

357
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:56,780
I have you freeze-framed right now.

358
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:57,780
I look like I'm about to puke.

359
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:01,420
The way you see my picture is even better.

360
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,420
Hold on, hold on.

361
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:05,420
Let me roll this back slightly so we can hear what Jamie has to say about podcasting.

362
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:14,420
We basically give the news for video games, popular culture, basically what gamers really want to know.

363
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:17,420
Okay, so they spelled Jamie's name right on the text over at least.

364
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:20,420
They didn't spell it right online, but they spelled it right on the text over.

365
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:26,420
Podcast producers record their programs, then send them to a number of websites now hosting the shows.

366
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:29,420
Now anyone can create, edit, and...

367
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:31,420
Ooh, pavement shot at me.

368
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:33,420
Yeah, but no pictures of me.

369
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:38,420
Lots of pictures of Rob, lots of pictures of Jamie, but no matter.

370
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:43,420
Hold on, I didn't hear what Jamie said there. I gotta roll it back.

371
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:48,480
to download it. It's something they can take with them. It's a much more flexible way of

372
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:53,160
spreading the information. With nothing more than an MP3 player and a set of headphones,

373
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:57,960
you can listen to it anywhere. Now people can talk about things they'd like to talk

374
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:04,480
about. Yeah, who's this random guy? Now they're interviewing random guy on the skateboard.

375
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,720
Like some dude they found. Where's the name? Casey Ryle. Yeah, some dude. If you listen

376
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:13,120
to our show, email us. Look, if Casey listens to the show, the more power to him, I'm glad

377
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:17,480
one of our listeners got to be a media whore. But I'd also like to point out, Casey only

378
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:22,480
owns an iPod shuffle, so he's not even that hardcore. Anyway.

379
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:30,120
People can join in and listen to, and it's really open, and lots of people can get into

380
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:33,640
it. A number of websites are now hosting... Again, if I didn't know he was talking about

381
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:39,800
podcasting, I'd find that pretty amusing. What grade am I in?

382
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,960
And now the reporter that... Keep playing.

383
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:59,760
Let me get the reporter here.

384
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:04,960
I would like to point out that that is the only time in the entire news clip that our

385
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:10,120
actual show name is put somewhere, because they never say Orange Lounge Radio.

386
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:13,760
when they're showing how to get to the podcast and stuff, that's when they bring up the Orange

387
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,940
Lounge Radio. It's like they show the person searching for Orange Lounge Radio and it comes

388
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:24,060
up in our little Intrigue. Oh, well, you know, that's nice. Good for them. I'm glad they

389
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:27,720
plugged the show, you know. Like, you know, maybe the SACB did. You know, at least they

390
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:34,720
put our damn URL in there. Extrovert, do you still think the reporter was cute? I did think

391
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,720
I think the reporter was cute, actually. I still hold to that.

392
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,720
Anyway...

393
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,720
...available podcasts are at your fingertips.

394
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,720
Free for you, free for the producers, free speech for everyone.

395
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,720
Oh, it's so much fun. It's great that, you know, just...

396
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,720
I like a piece of podcast!

397
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:02,720
Did you see? First of all, they have Loki

398
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:09,120

401
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:28,800
to me that's so much fun I mean what the hell am I talking about they don't say anything it's

402
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,800
It's just retarded.

403
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:32,600
I said a whole lot more than just, oh, it's so much fun!

404
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,600
Oh, it's so much fun!

405
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,600
Oh, it's so much fun!

406
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,600
Oh, look at that!

407
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:39,800
I look like a goddamn chipmunk!

408
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,800
My head looks like it has exploded!

409
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,800
I'm super fat!

410
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,800
Look at me!

411
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,800
You're in so much fun, Peter!

412
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,560
Did you think that maybe you are super fat?

413
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,360
No, I am not.

414
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:57,800
I was just having a momentary mental image of Krim.

415
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:01,880
Maybe I should be going, whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.

416
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,560
It was a night out.

417
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:09,200
Wait, let me see, let me see.

418
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:17,360
Let me see if I can, wait, let me see if I can, let me see if I can, let me see if I

419
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,920
can queue this up and do this rock your style.

420
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,440
That should be in the next intro.

421
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,440
Hold on.

422
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,440
Okay.

423
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,960
Hey, Loki, what do you think about gay sex?

424
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,960
Ugh, it's so much fun.

425
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,960
Don't worry, this will be continued later and effused. I have not forgot about them.

426
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,960
Let's let this finish up here.

427
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:45,960
Speech for everyone.

428
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,960
Ugh, it's so much fun.

429
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:51,960
It's great that, you know, just anybody out there who really has a desire to want to be heard,

430
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:55,480
you have an outlet for your voice to get out there chemically the less people

431
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,360
want this

432
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,100
in retro cordova brian hickey

433
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,380

everybody broadcasted out recently governor for senator began

435
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:06,960
i don't think i don't think that i didn't want to do it

436
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,960
it can be the fact that we have so you can listen to it

437
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:16,260
i'm sure i don't believe that i have to add to that

438
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:20,100
yeah i'm sure i'm sure you know i kept it very easy to listen to

439
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:23,100
when you understand half the words

440
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:26,680
we're going to track the budget now

441
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:29,260
thank you for downloading my podcast

442
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:31,860
rah rah rah rah

443
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:34,720
it's so much fun

444
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:41,240
i love my podcast it's so much fun it's tiny but it's good

445
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,700
oh you their own ipod shuffles

446
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:47,380
the ipod shuffles are the girly man's of ipods

447
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:52,100
Okay, so not only did they not plug our show, not even mention who our show was, not even

448
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:56,860
put me on there, gave me some really crappy line, when I had a whole lot more to say,

449
00:32:56,860 --> 00:33:01,420
you know, what's the, okay, so basically we're gonna ask you a lot of questions, we're gonna

450
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:05,380
get you saying something really stupid, cut to you for about a second, because, you know,

451
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:13,380
we have to, and then we're done. What the hell? What's up with that? It's like the pictures

452
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:27,900
the podcast. Oh, we forgot one. I had a cleavage shot. It's like, gee. Eyes up, yo. Okay. Look,

453
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:32,860
I'm responding to some comments in the chat room right now over at www.orangeloungeradio.com.

454
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:38,020
Click on chat. Illusion says, yeah, because Orange Lounge Radio has more name recognition

455
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:43,480
than Arnold Schwarzenegger. Well, someday we will. Sure. Well, we can if people don't

456
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:48,540
fucking plug our show. Hello? I mean, come on. How long is it going to take? Take the

457
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:54,460
extra two seconds. You can find this podcast here. Poop. Okay, put the URL up there. Done.

458
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:59,860
I mean, or just say, you know, just like this show out of Sacramento, Orange Launch Radio.

459
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:05,380
Just mention the name once. Once is all we're asking. Show the website. Show something.

460
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:11,380
Do you think that maybe we don't get our name on TV because here we are, just letting you tear this thing apart?

461
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:20,380
Fuck them! Zack B all the way! I don't give a shit if my goddamn foot was in there and that was it! At least they fucking mentioned our show! The hell with them, because they made me look like a fucking idiot!

462
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:24,380
That's what I have to say about that!

463
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:26,380
I

464
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:33,220
Don't give a crap okay, I honestly don't give if they showed me at least looking at saying something intelligent like podcasting

465
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:36,660
You know we've you know we've been doing this for six months now blah blah blah blah

466
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:39,500
We have a lot of following yada yada yada, okay, or something like that, okay?

467
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:43,580
That's fine, so I didn't say something really intelligent, but we love those fun

468
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:49,220
I mean come on. It's it's retarded or at least just show me. Here's the face of podcast, okay?

469
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:53,500
So I'm ugly or something show me really quick or something you know I mean you don't have to like

470
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:58,900
Like, goddamn, I don't, I don't understand. It's just, it's annoying.

471
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:01,300
So, Loki, what do you think of your anger management courses?

472
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:08,900
Oh, it's so much fun. I know what this is gonna turn into. It's gonna

473
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:13,900
be just like the other goddamn thing. Oh, oh, I, I shot my foot. I need to...

474
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:19,900
Loki, you're purple in the face. I'm not purple in the face. I'm angry.

475
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,900
can you see your face?

476
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,900
You are purple!

477
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,900
I'm not purple.

478
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,900
Oh no, I'm violet!

479
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,900
Damn gum.

480
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,900
I turned into a blueberry.

481
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,900
Oh, it's so much fun.

482
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,900
I had to resist. Had to one more time.

483
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,900
Alright, that won't be the last time, I'm sure.

484
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,900
Moving on.

485
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,900
It's gonna be cut down into a little clip

486
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:51,220
clip, and then you're going to be like, hey Matt, hey Logan, what do you think about this?

487
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:56,100
Oh, it's so much fun. Oh, it's so much fun. Oh, oh, oh, it's so much fun. You know what?

488
00:35:56,100 --> 00:36:00,020
Maybe we could compile some of this together and remix it.

489
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:04,660
I have an idea. Let's send them a friendly letter commenting on how wonderful they covered

490
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:11,620
our show. I'm sitting here going, you know what? No TV station give a rat's ass about

491
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:12,620
us before.

492
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:15,820
I look at it this way, it was about podcasting.

493
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:16,320
Yeah.

494
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,920
We were just podcasters who were convenient and had the most interesting material.

495
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,720
We were just pawns in the big operation, really.

496
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,220
Oh, good!

497
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:24,720
Damn the man!

498
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,220
I'm glad they mentioned everybody on the show.

499
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:29,020
Oh, wait, no, they didn't. That's right, they didn't.

500
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:29,520
Because...

501
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:31,420
Whatever.

502
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,220
Anyway.

503
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:35,820
We are gonna put that up on the internet.

504
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:37,120
Check our website.

505
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,520
You guys will be able to download it soon.

506
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,320
Also, big...

507
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,720
God damn it, you know what they're gonna do?

508
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:44,320
They're gonna play this at my work in front of goddamn 100 people, and it's gonna be like,

509
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,320
oh, it's so much fun.

510
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:51,720
And we're all gonna hear all goddamn day long next week, yay, oh, great new week!

511
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,720
Perfect way to start it off!

512
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,720
Thank you, KCRA3!

513
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,720
I cannot wait!

514
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:58,720
Are you done?

515
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:59,720
Yeah, I'm done yet.

516
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:00,720
Thank you.

517
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,720
I have actually news that happened to me this week.

518
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,720
Oh, what's that?

519
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:07,720
Now that I'm no longer bitter, actually I'm gonna be addressing most of it during the

520
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,720
FUs of the week, my work.

521
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:12,720
My package arrived. My prize.

522
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:16,720
Your package? Did it start off small and get a little bit bigger?

523
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,720
Okay, no seriously, what is it?

524
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:21,720
My Garuda stuff.

525
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,720
Oh, that's right. You were a winner on some site.

526
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:28,720
I am a winner. I won shit, but that wasn't really shit. It was really cool.

527
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,720
What kind of stuff did you win?

528
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,720
Well, this is from Filter magazine.

529
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:38,720
And first of all, it was going to be just a CD and the autographed magazine.

530
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,760
I had misunderstood the first email of the prize.

531
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:46,760
But since I already had the CD, and since I actually,

532
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,840
you know, when I was talking, I had to actually call

533
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,120
the lady to give her my change of address

534
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:52,720
because she didn't get my return email.

535
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,280
And we were just talking about stuff and, you know,

536
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:58,680
I said that I actually moderated on Gorillaz unofficial,

537
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:01,440
which is a really cool site for anyone interested.

538
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,580
But, what?

539
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:16,140
You can either pay attention to me or piss off, okay?

540
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:17,140
Alright.

541
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:26,260
Anyway, as I was saying, because, because, you know, I wasn't just some random person

542
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:33,780
filling out the little prize thingy, I actually got a mobile that I haven't seen anywhere

543
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:39,540
else except a couple of years that I saw on eBay but that's like it and I got the

544
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:44,940
autographs magazine and I got the sticker sheet and the little promo book

545
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:50,940
that's like cool promo book so how much would you say all this is worth on eBay

546
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:57,180
yeah I've seen the promo book go for a lot of money cool so so what are you

547
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:59,260
gonna do it are you gonna put it on display in your house somewhere you're

548
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:02,100
gonna keep it locked away in a little box to take out on days when you need

549
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:08,580
some gorillas. I don't know. What do people do with these things? I don't know. I've never

550
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:11,960
won anything like that before, really. Well, Dan and I have actually been off looking at

551
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:20,180
office furniture. And so once we get the office set up, it's gonna go in my area. Of our office.

552
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:23,720
The most excit- okay, now that's- see, there you go. The most exciting music-related thing

553
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:27,980
I ever won was when I got to meet Matchbox20, who, you know, I wasn't even like that big

554
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:31,080
a fan of him, but you know, I just won tickets off the radio and backstage passes, so we

555
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:34,840
I get to go meet Matchbox 20, and so I just have my little autograph hanging on the wall,

556
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:35,840
but that's about, you know.

557
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:40,800
I'm not really an autograph collector, you know, but this is just really cool.

558
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:46,360
I'm not much of an autograph collector either, however, I got Rob Thomas to sign my thing

559
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:51,080
and it says, to Rob, I think you're cute, and that's worth saving.

560
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:54,000
That's fun.

561
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,960
There's a whole story behind that, but I don't like the story.

562
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:01,040
When we get the scanner hooked up, I'm going to scan the magazine because I love how DJ

563
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:06,060
Danger Mouse signs it. He signs a DM with a circle around it, sort of like the old Danger

564
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:13,640
Mouse logo. I thought that was pretty cool. I had major happy nerd moment right then and

565
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:19,080
they're just staring at it for about five minutes going, ooh, Navy Seals. Oh, wrong

566
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:25,200
movie. Going back to it. Oh, since now we've had Jamie time, let's take a minute and have

567
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,200
some Loki time.

568
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,200
God.

569
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,200
God.

570
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,200
Damn.

571
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,200
Ow!

572
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,200
My foot!

573
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,200
Why did I shoot myself in my face?

574
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,200
Oh my God, it hurts so bad.

575
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,200
No!

576
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,200
My foot!

577
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:42,600
I need that for walking.

578
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:45,840
It's only funny if you were there for that episode.

579
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:48,600
Somebody in the chatroom asked if I still had that sound clip, so I just had to play

580
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,040
it for them.

581
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:52,360
We need to have some Loki singing during the break.

582
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,360
We also...

583
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:56,360
I think I actually deleted those MP3s finally.

584
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,360
No!

585
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,360
I thought it was somewhere.

586
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,360
I don't know.

587
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,360
They are safe, am I?

588
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,360
No!

589
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,880
Soccerina has a comment here in our chat room.

590
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:08,880
It has a suggestion for DarkSakura's next advice column on your show.

591
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:12,760
Yes, the advice column's theme would be how to piss off Loki.

592
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:13,880
And here we go.

593
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:16,840
Number one, get his foot on TV.

594
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:20,000
Number two, oh my god, it's so much fun.

595
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,340
Number three, talk about how in the groove is awesome.

596
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:26,180
Number four, say you'll buy him a Mac.

597
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:30,220
And the final piece of advice, just stay away.

598
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:31,820
That would piss him off?

599
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:32,820
I don't know.

600
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:36,500
Well, you know how usually your final piece of advice is, you know, just don't, like when

601
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:39,620
you're doing that, how to, you know, fly out of a cannon, your final piece of advice is

602
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:41,240
don't get in the fucking cannon.

603
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:46,220
I was thinking that my advice was going to be on how to safely inflate your ego without

604
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:48,460
it exploding into brain bits all over your company.

605
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:49,460
Well, that'll work.

606
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:51,700
I've been having lots of practice with that.

607
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:56,700
I have an advice, Collin. It's how to shoot an interview.

608
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:58,700
Because apparently, no.

609
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:07,700
You know, I was watching the other segments that they cut to before ours, so meaning these were more important.

610
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:09,700
That would be that it's hot.

611
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:11,700
The same story they covered all week!

612
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:15,700
Oh, guess what? It's still hot! In case you didn't figure that out by walking outside.

613
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:19,620
wanted to headline the news. Let's get Joe Hot Person on the street and see what he thinks.

614
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:25,620
It's hot out here. Come on. You know what? You know what? When I want to know exactly

615
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:29,860
how hot it is, I go to the Weather Channel's website and put in my damn zip code.

616
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:36,580
And then I know it's hot. Loki, if you want to be headline news, kill someone. Then you'll

617
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:41,300
headline the news. Yeah, thank God. It'll be close to us. We caught a killer today.

618
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:48,180
This girl's the host of Orange Lounge Radio, goes postal and kills 50 nuns because his

619
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:51,020
foot was the only thing on the TV.

620
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:52,020
Comment!

621
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:54,020
Knock it off!

622
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:58,340
I'm so quoted saying it's so much fun.

623
00:42:58,340 --> 00:42:59,340
Yes.

624
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:02,380
I should be a reporter.

625
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:10,820
It looks like it's another crazy killer who is inspired by the Grand Theft Auto San Andreas

626
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:15,080
games when asked about how much he enjoys Grand Theft Auto San Andreas the

627
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:23,840
killer replied it's so much fun guess what we have Grand Theft Auto San

628
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:29,720
Andreas you know oh the M or the GameStop is no longer allowed to take them in

629
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:33,980
as trade-ins oh really yes because they're not going to be selling anymore

630
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:36,800
but I don't understand why this is now everybody's saying this is going to be

631
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:39,680
such a collector's item because the thing is only like one of the top

632
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:44,520
selling games of all time on three platforms. It's not like... Why did they stop selling

633
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:49,720
it anyways? It's like, now it's like, oh no, oh no, damn, now those seventeen year olds

634
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:54,720
are not going to be ready for the sex. But the violence! Murder! Decapitation! Oh, that's

635
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:59,080
okay. Or what, now what about, what about like, you know, cause, now the game's worse

636
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:04,000
now because little kids might see nudity instead of, oh, I don't know, murdering. So kids might

637
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,120
go out, oh my god, kids are going to go out and get pregnant because they saw it in Grand

638
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:13,120
What I don't understand is that little kids are only going to see the nudity if they put in the little codes that enable it.

639
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:19,120
This is basically, I was going to save this for the podcast, but now you've got me on this subject, so I want to talk about this.

640
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:29,120
Okay, we've seen this happen before, with DDR even, right? Remember how when you put in the DDR USA, remember the very first release of DDR USA on the PlayStation?

641
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:33,000
As poopy of a game as it was, it was what got DDR in the door

642
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,720
on PlayStation here in the US.

643
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:37,240
Remember that people put in that disk and they hacked it?

644
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:39,020
And what did they find on the disk?

645
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:41,820
They found the background for Butterfly, and they found the

646
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:45,240
background for Bad Girls, but with the gun taken out.

647
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:49,440
So this obviously was, at one point or another, those songs

648
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,820
were meant to be, even if not Butterfly, if they were just

649
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:53,400
lazy from the best hits conversion

650
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:54,280
and left that in there.

651
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:56,880
Somebody altered the Bad Girls background.

652
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:00,640
That song was intended to be in DDR USA at one point or another.

653
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:05,720
But instead of what they did, instead of removing the song,

654
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:09,200
removing the background, removing everything from the code completely,

655
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,480
all they did was they took the pointer out.

656
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:14,120
The thing that points to bad girls as being a song in the game,

657
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:15,000
they took that out.

658
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,120
I think that's exactly what they did with Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.

659
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:22,920
I think that this sex thing was intended to be in the game the whole time.

660
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:26,160
But during some final QA review process or something,

661
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,660
they decided, you know what?

662
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:29,260
If we have the sex thing in the game,

663
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:30,900
I think that's crossing the line.

664
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:32,740
So instead of going through the efforts

665
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:34,500
to take it out of the programming, which

666
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:37,960
would be a pain in the ass, they simply took the pointer out.

667
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:40,340
And so they thought, well, if we just take the pointer out,

668
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:42,700
you take everything that points to the sex thing out,

669
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:43,980
nobody's going to find the sex thing,

670
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:45,380
because all the pointers are out.

671
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:48,620
Whoops, did they underestimate the PC hat community out there.

672
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:50,740
Once the PC hat community found it,

673
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:54,380
It was just a matter of time before somebody got the codes to basically what they're doing

674
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:58,220
is putting a pointer in that points back to the sex game.

675
00:45:58,220 --> 00:46:02,820
And now it's this whole big thing of oh, Rockstar Games knew it all along that they were going

676
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:03,820
to have the sex game.

677
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:07,680
Well, yeah, they knew they had a sex game in there, but they thought they took it out.

678
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:10,660
It's lazy programming is what happened here, I think.

679
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:13,940
It's still retarded, though, that people are coming after this game.

680
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:17,140
But anyways, we'll see if there are podcasts.

681
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:19,740
Well now you got me started on that.

682
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:22,780
Let's talk about how In The Groove sucks.

683
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:23,780
You know, I'm gonna...

684
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:25,020
We do that every show!

685
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:27,740
I know, and I'm not even, I don't even think In The Groove sucks as much as you do.

686
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:32,540
I didn't quite have the budget to buy In The Groove today, I thought about doing it just

687
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:37,380
so I could play it once and say it sucks and then write it sucks ass on the front cover

688
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:40,460
and then, you know, give it away.

689
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:43,500
But um, yeah.

690
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:47,380
I actually plan on playing In The Groove 2, uh, two weeks from now.

691
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:51,060
i'll be playing in the group to because i'm doing my east coast trip and i'm

692
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:53,900
gonna go buy it on the break one out there and i'm gonna check out

693
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:57,180
in group two so i can come back and give a review on the show

694
00:46:57,180 --> 00:47:00,180
and i can tell loki that it's probably not as bad as he thinks it is

695
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:03,460
that's me off something i have it on the new hc t t

696
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:04,900

well crap blown up

701
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:21,840
just like being all the speakers in the world will not make those in

702
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:27,140

710
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,120
sorority afraid

or come back from break we're to talk about our buddy media

712
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:02,360
because we'd like media

713
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:05,760
maybe that is something you you won't yell about right

714
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:06,360
moon

715
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:09,160
not a negative way

716
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:11,360
All right, so we're going to talk about Midihead.

717
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:14,440
In this break, we're going to do some Bamani potpourri.

718
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:17,400
We'll start it off with the song from Papa Music.

719
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:20,120
And we'll be back after this with more Orange Launch Radio.

720
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:23,400
Your call's on the Skype line also in this very next break.

721
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:26,280
So we'll be back after some Murmur twins kicking it off.

722
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:52,800
🎵

723
00:48:52,800 --> 00:49:08,440
You don't have to believe in a heart of a doubt

724
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:12,280
But it's not funny how you think you wanted to lose

725
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:16,280
All you have got is getting out of bed

726
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:19,280
If you wanted to lose in a heart of a doubt

727
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:22,280
I want to be a part of you, I want to be

728
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:26,280
A part of you is going to want to stay tonight

729
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:28,280
I just can't see the way it's done

730
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:31,280
So I don't mind that I made a start

731
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:34,280
To you, but I don't want to stop

732
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:40,280
You won't stay, you won't stop

733
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:42,280
I know you can't find me

734
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:45,280
I just don't know anything

735
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,280
Oh

736
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:55,280
I can't lie, I'm a killer, I understand, I can't lie

737
00:53:55,280 --> 00:54:05,280
I can't lie, I'm a killer, I understand, I can't lie

738
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:40,280
I can't be good again, alright

739
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:42,280
I can't be good again, alright

740
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:46,280
You're not the king of the world,

741
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:49,280
You are the voice of the world

742
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:52,280
You've got to go stronger than you

743
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:55,280
Oh God, oh God, oh God

744
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:57,280
I kept an eye on the trail

745
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:01,280
To try and save the sky

746
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:03,280
I kept an eye on the trail

747
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:07,280
I am a very picky guy

748
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:14,280
I am a very picky guy

749
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:44,120
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because Real Radio makes Captain Jack cry.

750
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:48,240
And we're back with Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 151.

751
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:50,680
And you can say that number forwards or backwards.

752
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:51,760
The story's the same.

753
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:53,520
Just thought you'd want to know.

754
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:56,580
So we're talking about old-ass show jokes in the chat room

755
00:55:56,580 --> 00:55:58,360
right now over at orangeloungeradio.com.

756
00:55:58,360 --> 00:55:59,360
Click on Chat.

757
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:01,800
And I was thinking about, remember when we reviewed

758
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:03,760
a Dance Dance Fuck on air?

759
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:06,480
Ha ha ha.

760
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:06,980
Good times.

761
00:56:06,980 --> 00:56:07,720
The old days.

762
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:11,320
That was the porno that was inspired by Dance Dance Revolution somehow.

763
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:13,120
When I say inspired by?

764
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:14,320
very loosely.

765
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:16,320
The me... yeah, like most of the girls in it.

766
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:20,120
Um, like I don't even think there was a part other than the title.

767
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:20,920
But they dance.

768
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:24,920
It was like Dance Dance Fuck Max... something... six or...

769
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:29,220
Yeah, it was like Dance Dance... it was Dance Dance Fuck six... or something.

770
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:29,920
Max.

771
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:31,920
I don't know. Dance Dance Fuck Max. I don't remember what it was.

772
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:34,420
That was years old, though. Years old.

773
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:38,720
I always thought the porno that had the, um, Final Fantasy X...

774
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:40,320
what was it, Final Fuck X?

775
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:41,520
Final Fuck X.

776
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:45,040
that was the better one because they had good cosplay

777
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:48,680
yeah they had some good cosplayers in them and then they got naked and had sex

778
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:49,760
but the Lulu

779
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:53,640
actually had a little stuffed muggle

780
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:57,680
anyway sorry kids

781
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:00,800
oh yeah by the way children

782
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:04,240
don't listen to this program it's bad bad for you you know I'm scared that I might have

783
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:05,520
co-workers listening to this

784
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:09,400
because they all found out about the news thing that happened last Friday

785
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:14,600
and some are asking, what's the web address? I'm like, oh crap. I don't care anymore. I

786
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:21,600
don't. Honestly, I don't. It's just, it's not worth it. It's not worth it. Dark Starkey,

787
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:25,800
you keep it under wraps pretty good, which your weekend hobby is at work. Well, no. I

788
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:29,440
tell everyone, hey, I'm on the radio. Really? Hey, listen to this. Hey, look at this, because

789
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:32,160
I don't really care. You're not worried about them hearing you talk about dance, dance,

790
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:32,660
fuck

791
00:57:32,660 --> 00:57:34,760
and all that

792
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:36,500

794
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:42,280

795
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:43,860

796
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:44,640
piece of

797
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:46,840
crap

798
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:50,580
hey i was looking for quality dance dance revolution products that came

799
00:57:50,580 --> 00:57:53,900
upon that was like quality

800
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:56,200
i was like i have to get back to my cubicle

801
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:59,860
i have the happy bunny magnet that you gave me in my cubicle

802
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:03,080
with Happy Bunny pointing down to his crotch, saying,

803
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:04,660
I bet you love my thingy.

804
00:58:04,660 --> 00:58:08,920
And I'm going to be taking my other one there, too,

805
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:12,940
that says, I love everybody except you assholes.

806
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:13,860
I don't think I have.

807
00:58:13,860 --> 00:58:16,340
Don't you have a pledge for a new position?

808
00:58:16,340 --> 00:58:18,620
I think you mentioned it a couple of times.

809
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:22,360
I like my job, but I have to, since I'm a presenter,

810
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:24,060
I'm in front of people most of the time,

811
00:58:24,060 --> 00:58:25,540
I have to stay politically correct.

812
00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:27,060
It's a very interesting challenge.

813
00:58:27,060 --> 00:58:46,060
Some of my friends theorize that's why I do this program is because I have to be so politically correct when I'm in front of a class teaching that this is my way of venting the other half of that, the unpolitically correct side of me, where I get to, you know, come on and say shit, piss, fuck, and people listen to that and laugh at it. I don't know.

814
00:58:46,060 --> 00:58:50,060
You mean they don't throw lawsuits our way? Why is that?

815
00:58:50,060 --> 00:58:52,060
Because we're on the interweb.

816
00:58:52,060 --> 00:58:55,060
That's right. No one likes the internet.

817
00:58:55,060 --> 00:59:07,060
Speaking of places you can't say shit, fuck, and cunt, there was, somebody had emailed me about this to my Orange Lounge account about, I guess, Attack of the Show, you know, the G4 program.

818
00:59:07,060 --> 00:59:18,060
They're gonna do, they're having problems finding a new host, so they're supposedly doing open tryouts in three cities, LA, New York, and San Francisco.

819
00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:21,880
I'm thinking we need to have a road trip and all three of us need to try out the new co-host

820
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:25,640
Because you know Loki on Attack of the Show would be

821
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:28,760
hilarious

822
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:31,880
Come on this show drunk. Oh my god. I so much fun

823
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:39,360
No, I'm seriously thinking about doing my only issue is though since I'm gonna be gone for two weeks

824
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:42,560
I have a feeling that that's when they're gonna be here in San Francisco is when I'm gone

825
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:45,720
So I'm not gonna be able to do it and they're gonna miss out on a great

826
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:52,680
candidate if I'm I can't be there to do it so then there I don't know I don't

827
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:55,440
they're just gonna get some big-breasted chicken doesn't know jack about

828
00:59:55,440 --> 01:00:03,960
technology done I hear cards I should lie but you know you you may have

829
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:09,400
adequate boobage but you know you don't you you actually know technology you

830
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:12,760
have a bigger gaming collection than the two of us combined well I have a bigger

831
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:16,560
your gaming collection than five of each of you combined.

832
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:20,600
Just grab one of the chicks off that stupid show the whips set or whatever you know.

833
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:22,040
I'll go to the audition

834
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:23,960
with my turbo express

835
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:27,600
and my wonder swan. Well here's the thing I was looking at the kevinpereira.com

836
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:30,400
which is the guy that's you know still the host on Attack of the Show

837
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:33,800
who by the way I like more and more as I see the show more and more. When the

838
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:37,480
screensavers first came out I was kinda like okay this guy's a boob

839
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:38,360
I don't like him

840
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:42,000
but I'm like I'm really warming up to him and I think what they're trying to do

841
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:45,480
with the show, he really does kind of fit it, and he's kind of funny, and I think now

842
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:51,100
that he's... yeah, he'll have to go! I think when it first started as The Screensavers,

843
01:00:51,100 --> 01:00:55,360
I think it was always kind of trying to fit a square peg in a round hole kind of thing,

844
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:59,200
and I think he realizes this, so even if, you know, for some weird reason he heard me

845
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:01,960
saying this, he wouldn't be offended because I think he realizes this, because even he

846
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:08,160
says that first episode of The Screensavers was bad. And it was. But when they did this

847
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:11,640
own show thing, I think he got a chance to kind of grow into the show that he really

848
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:20,520
wanted to do and I think he just, his value on TV increased like 500% so he's a good guy.

849
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:23,600
But on his site he was talking about kind of what they're looking for in a new host

850
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:28,560
and they're not, he said, we're not looking for a pretty face but we're not looking for

851
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:32,400
someone that just is about the technology. We're looking for someone that wants to be

852
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:36,320
on TV talking about technology. And for some reason they're having a hard time finding

853
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:38,200
that. Yes, Dark Sakura.

854
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:39,200
I'm volunteering.

855
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:42,840
but wait a minute though you don't want to support the webcam at you yet you

856
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:44,080
would be on television

857
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:47,760
I'd hire a trainer

858
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:51,960
I'd do it. I could talk about technology. That's all I talk about

859
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:55,320
You want to get me to lose weight? Put me in a social situation

860
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:58,600
every freaking day

861
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:02,880
I guarantee you I won't eat for a month

862
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:06,320
I hear cabinets is what I hear

863
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:09,480
I heard knocking.

864
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:13,560
I could do it.

865
01:02:13,560 --> 01:02:16,720
Easy. Easy.

866
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:20,640
It's so much fun. Is it?

867
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:24,640
Is it now? You know it's tiny, but it's grown. Yeah.

868
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:29,280
Rob, you abandoned us! How dare you!

869
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:33,640
50 lashes with a chocolate lip.

870
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:36,640
Rob, you can't go on Attack on the Show, because we need to do our show.

871
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:44,640
If somebody offered me money to do a live television show, I'd be all, screw you guys, I'm going to L.A.

872
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:46,640
No, I'm just kidding, I love you guys.

873
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:50,640
I'd at least give you my two weeks, come on.

874
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:52,640
You bastard.

875
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:54,640
At that point...

876
01:02:55,640 --> 01:02:57,640
At that point, you have a Menchie hat!

877
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:00,640
Give!

878
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:02,640
From Anime Expo, you want it?

879
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:03,640
Yes.

880
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:05,640
I have a Menchie hat.

881
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:06,640
Anyway.

882
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:08,640
Let's eat her!

883
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:10,640
She's emergency food supply!

884
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:12,640
I have a Menchie hat.

885
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:15,640
Anyway, joining us by the way, who hasn't been at this show in an awfully long time,

886
01:03:15,640 --> 01:03:18,640
is the one and only explicit with three X's.

887
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:20,640
Our angry guy!

888
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:21,640
Well, I'm actually...

889
01:03:21,640 --> 01:03:23,640
Trust what we need this show.

890
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:26,640
Alright, I'm not going to be angry this time.

891
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:27,640
I've got some more important...

892
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:29,640
More important than just being angry.

893
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:34,280
Now, we were talking about TV earlier, and we were talking about Attack of the Show and

894
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:40,240
how we're all going to be on it soon, because we want to do that.

895
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:45,960
Supposedly some folks were emailing them too about us going on, so nobody contacted us,

896
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:47,760
so I guess it wasn't enough people.

897
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:52,920
So go email them and tell them we're ready to whore ourselves out to be on cable.

898
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:56,680
Because we figure, okay, we've done the newspaper, we've done local TV, now we have to do basic

899
01:03:56,680 --> 01:03:57,680
cable.

900
01:03:57,680 --> 01:03:58,680
That's the next step up.

901
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:03,520
So far, like Captain Canada, Toady, and me got that spotlight right there.

902
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:07,780
Now I was going to say, what happened, now you also had a television experience recently,

903
01:04:07,780 --> 01:04:11,720
we had channel 3, but you had another station in town, what was yours a thing about?

904
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:21,680
It was basically like, the scenery of the DDR, and introducing the game to people, for

905
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:28,320
like perfect attack and freestyle, in addition to how this one person lost this much weight

906
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:33,480
on DDR. So they were kind of doing more like a DDR story and here's the dance, they were

907
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:38,180
doing that typical Dance Dance Revolution in the news story where DDR, it's better than

908
01:04:38,180 --> 01:04:41,740
Grand Theft Auto because instead of making kids want to kill people, it makes them get

909
01:04:41,740 --> 01:04:48,340
up and exercise and want to lose weight. But then, now the little piece I saw of it had

910
01:04:48,340 --> 01:04:53,180
Andrew dressed up like a pirate. Yep, that's true. And that other guy that's always with

911
01:04:53,180 --> 01:04:59,720
them and dressed up as Darth Vader. A different Andrew. Yeah. And they were just, you know,

912
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:05,660
being themselves, but on TV. Or in the media, I guess. Yes. I would have totally gone if

913
01:05:05,660 --> 01:05:11,000
I didn't have to work. Yeah. You would bring Orange Eyes radio to the TV. Yeah, so we had

914
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:15,720
to go get our own gig, since we couldn't go to yours. I heard about Channel 3, so...

915
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:22,720
We played the clip earlier, you missed it. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, oh. Oh, Loki, I'm

916
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:26,720
I'm so glad you suggested it here, um, let me, um, get to the little vase here.

917
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:29,720
What'd you find? What'd you find, ArtSakura?

918
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:32,720
I found the Menchi hat, cause I want one now.

919
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:35,720
You want that?

920
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:36,720
Alright.

921
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:39,720
Yes, this is from Anime X-bomb, who's giving away some stuff from Anime X-bomb?

922
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:41,720
Okay! If you don't want the Menchi hat, sure!

923
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:44,720
Alright, this is just for you, Jonas.

924
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:46,720
Um, Loki, what did you think about being on television?

925
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:48,720
Oh, it's so much fun.

926
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:49,720
It's great.

927
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:51,720
That was Loki's big television debut.

928
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:53,720
That was it!

929
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:55,720
That was it!

930
01:05:57,720 --> 01:05:59,720
Oh wow.

931
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:03,720
Anyway, from what I heard from the taping though

932
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:05,720
Loki, you know what this is?

933
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:09,720
The world's smallest violin playing My Heart Bleeds For You.

934
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:14,720
Yeah, from what I've heard from the taping, the two Andrews were there

935
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:18,720
and some background people doing PA

936
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:24,360
And then me and, kind of doing a little freestyle, get to see, introduce it to the scenery.

937
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:29,640
And I'm not really sure if Scott Farah, the gaming guy of Channel 31 came back to introduce

938
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:30,640
the tournament.

939
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:33,920
I didn't even know we had a gaming guy on local television.

940
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:34,920
We had a gaming guy?

941
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:35,920
Yeah.

942
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:38,560
His name is Scott Farah on the morning show.

943
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:40,080
Usually he's there on Mondays.

944
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:41,240
I'm the guy.

945
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:42,240
The gaming guy.

946
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:43,240
Is that his job?

947
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:46,080
Is that strictly his job is to be the gaming guy?

948
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:47,080
Dude!

949
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:51,580
I want to be the gaming guy. I'm cute. I can be on TV.

950
01:06:51,580 --> 01:06:54,580
You're going to be there on the tournament if you're still interested in going on the 30th.

951
01:06:54,580 --> 01:07:00,080
I might, except I have a flight leaving the very next day, so I'm going to try and make it.

952
01:07:00,080 --> 01:07:03,080
Tell us, plug your tournament, plug your tourney thing that you're doing.

953
01:07:03,080 --> 01:07:10,080
Well, we had one tournament, they won a tournament already yesterday for the Initial D section.

954
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:11,580
Oh yeah? How'd that go?

955
01:07:11,580 --> 01:07:23,580
It turned out pretty okay, so-so in certain ways, because we had some problems with someone's card, didn't read it, but then again, they said the card was bent, so I don't know what happened.

956
01:07:23,580 --> 01:07:33,580
It was 8 competitors, the first place winner was some guy named Jay, second place was T, and third was Kenshin.

957
01:07:33,580 --> 01:07:38,580
Jonas, you know what you and I need to do? We need to work on Shaft 2.

958
01:07:38,580 --> 01:07:40,580
Oh yes.

959
01:07:40,580 --> 01:07:44,580
But we're gonna post it though, so far, with the plans.

960
01:07:44,580 --> 01:07:46,580
Yeah, but I need to, we need to talk.

961
01:07:46,580 --> 01:07:53,580
Cause I've been needing to get SHAP2 run for a while and they've been kinda being assholes at RVGL.

962
01:07:53,580 --> 01:07:56,580
Oh, that's why I don't deal with RVGL.

963
01:07:56,580 --> 01:07:59,580
They, their management with tournaments, no.

964
01:07:59,580 --> 01:08:05,580
This facility would be great, otherwise, I don't want to deal with what's-his-face.

965
01:08:05,580 --> 01:08:12,580
No, it's funny, because their management also put repairing their machines as no and listening to the customers as no.

966
01:08:12,580 --> 01:08:14,580
That's really ironic, the way that works.

967
01:08:14,580 --> 01:08:17,580
Wait, wait, wait. Are you serious?

968
01:08:17,580 --> 01:08:21,580
Okay, first of all, RBGL is a business, so...

969
01:08:21,580 --> 01:08:23,580
We'll talk to you in the chat room. Hold the microphone a little bit back.

970
01:08:23,580 --> 01:08:24,580
Okay.

971
01:08:24,580 --> 01:08:28,580
Which is funny, because Jonas actually doesn't hold his microphone that close to his mouth.

972
01:08:28,580 --> 01:08:30,580
He's just got that kind of voice, kids.

973
01:08:30,580 --> 01:08:31,580
But that's all right.

974
01:08:31,580 --> 01:08:37,580
That's alright. I mean, let's see, I don't know why RBGL doesn't want a tournament, because I've done this before myself.

975
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:46,580
Well, that's where F.U. was supposed to be held. But then I decided to do P.I. because that's the only place that would host a tournament.

976
01:08:46,580 --> 01:08:54,580
Scandia, they want to do their own gig. Of course, you've been to one of their tournaments.

977
01:08:54,580 --> 01:08:57,940
I did go to one of those Scandia tournaments. It was okay. It was cute.

978
01:08:57,940 --> 01:08:58,440
Yeah.

979
01:08:58,440 --> 01:09:03,740
It wasn't like a large-scale DDR tournament. It wasn't the kind of thing you should drive in from San Francisco for, but it was cute.

980
01:09:03,740 --> 01:09:04,740
Yeah, I know.

981
01:09:04,740 --> 01:09:05,740
Yeah.

982
01:09:05,740 --> 01:09:10,840
And if, yeah, first off, right, Jamie, first off, take care of the, um, the tournament that's happening this Saturday.

983
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:12,840
Then I'll, we'll talk about Shaft 2.

984
01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:15,840
No, I meant factor, because I've got to deal with school starting.

985
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:16,340
Oh, yeah.

986
01:09:16,340 --> 01:09:18,340
Once I get in my school schedule, I'll have more time to apply to that.

987
01:09:18,340 --> 01:09:18,840
All right.

988
01:09:18,840 --> 01:09:21,840
Yeah, just give me a call at any time and reply and we'll see what's up.

989
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:25,840
So many people want to help out with the whole tournament issues.

990
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:34,840
And Shaft had such a good turnout and it ended up being one of the big ones when it was out that I think that putting the name on it would give us a big draw-in.

991
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:35,840
I'll see what happens.

992
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:38,840
We got a few people. We got a few of the Omaha people.

993
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:41,840
Yeah, I remember that. That was pretty cool. It was a good time.

994
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:44,840
And the 2DX tournament, too, was cool, except we won't be having that again.

995
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:45,840
Wasn't that Marshall Brandis, though?

996
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:46,840
We did it at Shaft.

997
01:09:46,840 --> 01:09:47,840
That was at Shaft.

998
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:48,840
We did both. It was both.

999
01:09:48,840 --> 01:09:49,840
Oh, okay.

1000
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:58,840
Anyway, what we're going to do now, I was going to talk about the Midihead thing, so let me get into that.

1001
01:09:58,840 --> 01:10:06,840
Midihead, our buddy that had a song over in UltraMix 2, he did, you know, the In My Eyes remix was in UltraMix 2, remember that?

1002
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:10,840
Pretty good song there, very well-liked fan favorite.

1003
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:18,400
Um, he's back, he's going to be in, um, he's going to be in UltraMix 3, and he actually

1004
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:22,520
is debuting his brand new tracks from UltraMix 3.

1005
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:25,960
We've played one of them here on the show before, we've played the song Raise Your Hands

1006
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:30,480
here on the show previously, but he's debuting the new Jelly Kiss remix, what is it, the

1007
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:33,560
Jelly Kiss Midi Head Smack Mix is what it's called?

1008
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:38,680
It's a brand new remix of Jelly Kiss and he's debuting it on his own podcast, and we're

1009
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:42,000
We're actually mirroring the podcast over on OrangeLunchRadio.com, so if you want to

1010
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:45,920
check it out, what Midyhead did is he kind of put this whole show together.

1011
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:51,480
He engineered this 30-minute show where he plays his track from Ultramix 2.

1012
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:56,040
He played the Wraith song from his upcoming album.

1013
01:10:56,040 --> 01:10:59,080
He played, what else did he play?

1014
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:00,920
He played Raise Your Hands.

1015
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:03,060
He played Take Me Away From Here.

1016
01:11:03,060 --> 01:11:07,680
And then he plays the new remix from DDR Ultramix 3.

1017
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:12,000
the jelly kiss mini head smack mix we're gonna play a clip of this mix for you

1018
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:15,560
guys we want you guys to actually go and download the podcast yourself to check

1019
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:19,360
it out we want to support MIDI head with that but we will play a little clip so

1020
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:26,360
So here you go, here's a clip of the midi head smack mix of Jelly Kiss.

1021
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:58,120
So it sounds pretty cool. It sounds like it's going to be a fun little remix there. I remember

1022
01:11:58,120 --> 01:12:03,040
playing it at E3 and I loved the remix of Jelly Kiss, so it was probably my favorite

1023
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:08,020
thing. I actually tried to play it. What did you think of the song? My hip ended up being

1024
01:12:08,020 --> 01:12:13,960
a screaming nightmare of agony. But that's not because of the song. No, I liked the song.

1025
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:18,280
I wish I could have played it, only got halfway through it before my hip gave out on me. So

1026
01:12:18,280 --> 01:12:19,720
So anyway, check that out.

1027
01:12:19,720 --> 01:12:23,440
Midyhead doing his own podcast thing.

1028
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:26,120
If you're too lazy to set up the podcasting thing,

1029
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:29,280
there's a direct link that they're hosting on DDRFreak.

1030
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:30,720
So check that out on ddrfreak.com.

1031
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:33,240
You can just download the MP3 right there, which, by the

1032
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:35,900
way, I think would probably be the only time I've ever seen a

1033
01:12:35,900 --> 01:12:39,600
Bamani-related MP3 so blatantly on DDRFreak.

1034
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:41,660
So that's kind of a historical thing as well.

1035
01:12:41,660 --> 01:12:43,920
So check that out.

1036
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:46,760
It's nice.

1037
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:53,760
But Montystyle isn't hosting the file per se, but they ran an article on it and so did

1038
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:54,760
DDRUK.

1039
01:12:54,760 --> 01:13:00,080
And that's thanks to one of our listeners, actually, who is mod on all those sites.

1040
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:04,400
Anyway, check that out.

1041
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:06,160
It's a good time.

1042
01:13:06,160 --> 01:13:08,360
It's a good podcast.

1043
01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:12,880
The thing about Midihead too is he does these funny radio voiceovers during the whole thing

1044
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:13,880
too.

1045
01:13:13,880 --> 01:13:14,880
He's like, this is Midihead!

1046
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:17,880
You're just going like crazy during the whole thing.

1047
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:19,880
Yeah, you got a shout-out on the thing.

1048
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:22,880
I didn't get a shout-out. Jamie didn't get a shout-out. You got a shout-out.

1049
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:24,880
Your mic's not on.

1050
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:26,880
Damn straight, because the mic needs me on.

1051
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:29,880
No, because I'm awesome.

1052
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:31,880
And I hang out on those forums.

1053
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:35,880
Yeah, you just get it because you have the shout-out because you hang out on the forums.

1054
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:37,880
That's what it is, basically.

1055
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:39,880
What it boils down to.

1056
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:41,880
So, Loki, what did you think of the Midihead podcast?

1057
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:43,880
It was so much fun.

1058
01:13:43,880 --> 01:13:50,880
Anyway, not as much fun as this McDonald's BBQ sauce.

1059
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:57,880
Alright, since you guys are eating. By the way, Midihead also teases the fact that there's a third song he's going to have in the game.

1060
01:13:57,880 --> 01:14:03,880
He pretty much all but says, I have a third song in UltraMix 3, but he's teasing us. He's not telling us what that song is.

1061
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:12,880
So, we're assuming that the reason why you might want to subscribe to the podcast and not just download the direct file, unless you're lazy and don't want to set up podcasting,

1062
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:16,880
you probably want to subscribe to the podcast because whenever this third song is

1063
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:17,520
announced

1064
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:21,760
he will probably do a podcast part 2 and that's gonna be the first place you're gonna

1065
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:22,720
hear this new song

1066
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:27,380
so he pretty much all but said he's gonna have a third song in the game so we're

1067
01:14:27,380 --> 01:14:29,240
kinda interested to see what that is

1068
01:14:29,240 --> 01:14:32,440
but you notice that they've kind of in general

1069
01:14:32,440 --> 01:14:35,800
been very very quiet about these recent

1070
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:39,440
DDR games like they haven't been doing the clues

1071
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:42,680
they usually do the clues around this time where people try to guess what the

1072
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:44,160
songs are that are going to be in the game

1073
01:14:44,160 --> 01:14:48,120
they haven't been saying a whole lot about the features we've really gotten

1074
01:14:48,120 --> 01:14:51,240
not a lot since E3 besides this Midihead thing

1075
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:55,600
not a problem, they'll just send another demo for GamePro the review and

1076
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:59,680
BOOM! There you go, there's everything. Why do you think that is that they're being so

1077
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:04,320
tight-lipped about it this time? Because GamePro sucks? No, not GamePro, that's nothing to do with GamePro

1078
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:06,800
I'm talking about in general Konami's lack of

1079
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:10,160
playing around on the forums. I mean,

1080
01:15:10,160 --> 01:15:14,520
some of the Konami reps are playing on DDR Freak and they chime in once in a

1081
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:15,000
while.

1082
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:18,440
Even Miklotov, who's been on the show a couple times, he's jumped in there, but

1083
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:22,000
you notice that when Miklotov has been on the show, he's been very...

1084
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:26,480
he hasn't said, like, anything. Not nearly what he was telling us this time last year.

1085
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:30,480
On the show, he's not saying a whole lot about the new games.

1086
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:33,920
So...

1087
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:38,960
they're doing some weird things with this uh... the releases coming out so

1088
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:43,920
good things but weird things so i'm thinking they're probably just going to

1089
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:48,920
keep it in a wrap so when it comes out and people go oh wow you know instead of

1090
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:51,440
just ah it sounds like crap and then they don't buy it

1091
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:55,880
so it's more of a shock factor they don't really have to give hints why no other

1092
01:15:55,880 --> 01:15:58,320
companies give hints about what their games are going to be like

1093
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:02,160
fuck it wait you know be patient rockstars on their forums going hey guys

1094
01:16:02,160 --> 01:16:07,640
you know you can unlock a sex game I think you know what I think there was a

1095
01:16:07,640 --> 01:16:11,600
e3 strategy that worked very well for them and that is that they didn't say

1096
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:18,600
shit about Beatmania USA until e3 itself it was a very very quiet thing they they

1097
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:22,960
had said oh yeah we're gonna have you know Xtreme 2 and DDR Ultramix 3 and all

1098
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:27,720
that stuff but they didn't say anything about they didn't say anything about

1099
01:16:27,720 --> 01:16:32,560
about Beatmania. Because if they had said something about Beatmania, people were going

1100
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:36,080
to come up with all these preconceived notions about what they wanted in Beatmania. And when

1101
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:40,520
that wasn't met, they were going to be disappointed. I have a feeling it's a similar thing they're

1102
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:45,120
doing here. They're not saying anything about the games, because if they do, people are

1103
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:50,520
just going to go, wah wah wah, why isn't this feature in the game, and why didn't they put

1104
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:55,400
this song in, and wah wah wah. I think they're just trying to avoid that, because it seems

1105
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:58,340
that's what happens when they tell us the song list is people go although

1106
01:16:58,340 --> 01:17:01,580
there are the people that are appreciative of the hints and that

1107
01:17:01,580 --> 01:17:05,420
deserve to know these things in advance there's just a few bad apples that ruin

1108
01:17:05,420 --> 01:17:08,780
it for everyone that people would get on there and go why don't we get this song

1109
01:17:08,780 --> 01:17:13,520
and why haven't we gotten cartoon heroes and DDR yet wasn't wasn't genie in a

1110
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:20,900
bottle in a was a DDR extreme 2 genie a bottle or what was it they had some like

1111
01:17:20,900 --> 01:17:27,180
Christina Aguilera song or something like that, and then they got like Britney I think

1112
01:17:27,180 --> 01:17:35,680
in there too, but I'm actually interested to hear those again, I don't know.

1113
01:17:35,680 --> 01:17:38,540
They weren't in the E3 thing though, it was just a preview.

1114
01:17:38,540 --> 01:17:39,540
They had a clip.

1115
01:17:39,540 --> 01:17:40,540
They had a thing.

1116
01:17:40,540 --> 01:17:45,580
There was a clip of the Genie in the Bottle thing that was on some video of somebody from

1117
01:17:45,580 --> 01:17:48,700
E3 or something, that's right, no they did have Genie in the Bottle in the E3 demo, but

1118
01:17:48,700 --> 01:17:50,860
it was so freaking loud you couldn't hear.

1119
01:17:50,860 --> 01:17:55,460
That's right. And I thought that they mentioned, though, something about oops, I did it again,

1120
01:17:55,460 --> 01:18:00,380
too, being in there. I thought, because I remember after that, people, oh, long versions

1121
01:18:00,380 --> 01:18:02,580
are coming back, and we're like, no.

1122
01:18:02,580 --> 01:18:09,940
No, oops wasn't in there, but I think it's kind of assumed that it's going to be a different

1123
01:18:09,940 --> 01:18:15,220
cut of oops, I did it again. So, all right. Anyway, I'm just kind of reading what's going

1124
01:18:15,220 --> 01:18:18,780
on in the chat room, and I think some people are kind of agreeing with the same thing that,

1125
01:18:18,780 --> 01:18:22,740
know people are basically Konami isn't wanting to deal with the obnoxious

1126
01:18:22,740 --> 01:18:25,820
people that whine about everything they release and all that other stuff going

1127
01:18:25,820 --> 01:18:33,540
on there. And then let's see I thought the E3 build of Beatmania was just a

1128
01:18:33,540 --> 01:18:38,500
throw together. I think in some ways it was because some things weren't enabled

1129
01:18:38,500 --> 01:18:42,940
in there but I think I think it's gonna be what they're going in the direction

1130
01:18:42,940 --> 01:18:46,980
towards I think it is going to be basically a night style redone for us

1131
01:18:46,980 --> 01:18:51,640
with different songs and the whole five key songs and five key mode which I

1132
01:18:51,640 --> 01:18:54,500
think is pretty cool. I don't know if it was necessarily thrown together because

1133
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:58,700
that five key song and five key mode probably took a little... It's a beta. It's supposed to be

1134
01:18:58,700 --> 01:19:02,540
thrown together. That's what a beta is. I think they wanted to show what they were

1135
01:19:02,540 --> 01:19:05,820
gonna do but not, I mean, obviously they probably haven't made a lot of progress

1136
01:19:05,820 --> 01:19:08,260
on the game because they're working on the DDRs instead. You kind of wonder what these fans are...

1137
01:19:08,260 --> 01:19:12,460
Oh what? I expected the full game to be done. No, you idiot. They're not gonna have

1138
01:19:12,460 --> 01:19:17,400
the full game done. It's obviously a work in progress. I mean, they're just showing

1139
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:23,300
off what they have. That's why they have the E3 version. I mean, people are like, oh, the

1140
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:32,300
full game is going to suck because it doesn't have seven key and wine. So, you know, whatever.

1141
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:35,740
All right. What we're going to do now, I guess we're going to go to a break. When we come

1142
01:19:35,740 --> 01:19:39,660
back from break, we'll take your calls. Sorry, I promised that we'd do the Skype thing this

1143
01:19:39,660 --> 01:19:42,660
break but we didn't get around to it so we'll take your calls on Skype when we

1144
01:19:42,660 --> 01:19:47,580
come back from this next break and we will also do the cage match tonight

1145
01:19:47,580 --> 01:19:51,340
because I keep promising we're gonna get into that as well so let's start off

1146
01:19:51,340 --> 01:19:56,100
this break with I think we'll do some home version song here also you know

1147
01:19:56,100 --> 01:19:58,740
what I feel like I feel like playing that one love is orange mix it's a

1148
01:19:58,740 --> 01:20:00,980
little bit longer of a song but I think we're gonna fit it in here because I

1149
01:20:00,980 --> 01:20:04,580
feel like playing that so we're gonna play that and we'll be back with more

1150
01:20:04,580 --> 01:20:11,580
more Orange Lounge Radio in the cage match and your calls on the skype line after this.

1151
01:25:04,580 --> 01:25:07,080
Hey, listen, let me tell you, let me tell you

1152
01:25:07,080 --> 01:25:10,080
Just a question, man, can you rest a little bit, just a little?

1153
01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:12,080
Oh

1154
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:44,080

a

1159
01:27:00,080 --> 01:27:04,080
a

1160
01:27:04,080 --> 01:27:08,080
a

1161
01:27:08,080 --> 01:27:32,880
easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song orange lounge radio hi kids we're back

1162
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:37,760
with more orange lounge radio here we're gonna get in the cage match somewhat shortly but

1163
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:41,120
But we also wanted to start taking your calls on the

1164
01:27:41,120 --> 01:27:41,880
Skype line.

1165
01:27:41,880 --> 01:27:44,840
So if you want to call us, head on over to the Skype line.

1169
01:27:55,440 --> 01:27:59,980
And so while we have that open up, I don't see a whole lot

1170
01:27:59,980 --> 01:28:00,800
of people sign in.

1171
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:01,680
Maybe we'll get a couple calls.

1172
01:28:01,680 --> 01:28:04,280
We'll see.

1173
01:28:04,280 --> 01:28:06,600
But meanwhile, I want to remind you guys about

1174
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:12,960

01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:33,780
make sure that we get up there. All right, now our phone line is starting to light up

1179
01:28:33,780 --> 01:28:36,780
So here we go, we're gonna take a call. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1180
01:28:36,780 --> 01:28:41,780
Hey Skye, Siggy here. Hi Siggy! It's the 2DX bastard.

1181
01:28:41,780 --> 01:28:43,780
Hello!

1182
01:28:43,780 --> 01:28:48,780
Konbanwa minasan. Konbanwa ogenki desu ka?

1183
01:28:48,780 --> 01:28:51,780
Ogenki desu.

1184
01:28:51,780 --> 01:28:58,780
Well, just, you know, just some off-topic stuff. I got some 2DX, you know, Happy Skye.

1185
01:28:58,780 --> 01:29:00,780
Some interesting stuff about Happy Skye.

1186
01:29:00,780 --> 01:29:06,780
Oh, what's going on with Happy Sky? I'm going to get to those MP3s you sent me later, too. I haven't forgotten. I just want to save it for later.

1187
01:29:06,780 --> 01:29:12,780
Well, you can play a small clip if you want. I'm just going to announce them, the hidden songs.

1188
01:29:12,780 --> 01:29:19,780
Okay, hold on. I've got to get that rigged up, though. So how did they... So what, did a code come out that unlocked these songs, or how did this happen? How did we get the new songs?

1189
01:29:19,780 --> 01:29:23,780
Well, they're only unlocked for e-amusement.

1190
01:29:23,780 --> 01:29:28,780
Oh, I see. So, in other words, it's songs we will never play over here in the States.

1191
01:29:28,780 --> 01:29:32,780
Unless they're upgraded to a new 2DX mix.

1192
01:29:32,780 --> 01:29:35,780
Hmm. Very interesting.

1193
01:29:35,780 --> 01:29:37,780
Um, why am I having a hard time finding...

1194
01:29:37,780 --> 01:29:40,780
Oh! Hold on, I'm having a hard time locating those files,

1195
01:29:40,780 --> 01:29:42,780
because for some reason I thought you sent them to me on AIM,

1196
01:29:42,780 --> 01:29:45,780
but then I remembered you can't send me things on AIM.

1197
01:29:45,780 --> 01:29:49,780
Well, I never have your AIM suite to be named.

1198
01:29:49,780 --> 01:29:50,780
I can hook you up with that a little later.

1199
01:29:50,780 --> 01:29:53,780
Alright, I got the songs loaded. What are the songs here?

1200
01:29:53,780 --> 01:29:59,780
Okay, the song, uh, the artist is, uh, 4-1-4, and the song title is Double Thrash.

1201
01:29:59,780 --> 01:30:01,780
Okay, we have a little clip of that one here.

1202
01:30:06,780 --> 01:30:08,780
Alright, cool.

1203
01:30:08,780 --> 01:30:13,780
Um, let me check, uh, it's, uh, by Hoshino Kanako, and it's, uh, Get Cool.

1204
01:30:13,780 --> 01:30:16,780
Is that this one that doesn't have a label on it? Is that this one?

1205
01:30:19,780 --> 01:30:21,780
Oh, that's not, uh, that's not Get Cool.

1206
01:30:21,780 --> 01:30:22,420
well

1207
01:30:22,420 --> 01:30:24,780
well i don't know which one i was then

1208
01:30:24,780 --> 01:30:27,100
maybe i don't have that one

1209
01:30:27,100 --> 01:30:29,020
do you know which one i was i just played

1210
01:30:29,020 --> 01:30:30,620
on nevermind out

1211
01:30:30,620 --> 01:30:31,900
out of the failure

1212
01:30:31,900 --> 01:30:34,300
well i'll just say the next on it

1213
01:30:34,300 --> 01:30:36,700
plasma by uh...

1214
01:30:36,700 --> 01:30:39,700
yeah plasma by uh... used i think uh...

1215
01:30:39,700 --> 01:30:40,620
but i don't know

1216
01:30:40,620 --> 01:30:43,200
i thought it would you worry did plasma yes

1217
01:30:43,200 --> 01:30:50,200
yet but yeah i here's a clip of plasma

1218
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:54,480
without medical

1219
01:30:54,480 --> 01:30:57,000
and i don't like every other sort of who's my son that's right

1220
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:00,040
and then the next time is the or are by you start

1221
01:31:00,040 --> 01:31:02,180
uh...

1222
01:31:02,180 --> 01:31:06,180
i don't know if i have that one did you send me everything

1223
01:31:06,180 --> 01:31:07,240
i have a except

1224
01:31:07,240 --> 01:31:11,100
but i've got them ok alright

1225
01:31:11,100 --> 01:31:12,980
and then the last one is uh...

1226
01:31:12,980 --> 01:31:17,180
This is going to be very complicated to say.

1227
01:31:17,180 --> 01:31:17,900
It's by Ginger.

1228
01:31:17,900 --> 01:31:20,580
It's called casteless while eyejaw cancel tissue.

1229
01:31:28,980 --> 01:31:31,140
That sounds like it should have a long, complicated name.

1230
01:31:31,140 --> 01:31:31,940
That's kind of interesting.

1231
01:31:31,940 --> 01:31:33,020
OK.

1232
01:31:33,020 --> 01:31:34,620
This one's translated in English.

1233
01:31:34,620 --> 01:31:36,580
Casteless while eyejaw cancel tissue.

1234
01:31:36,580 --> 01:31:39,140
I just translated it on some site.

1235
01:31:39,140 --> 01:31:46,860
it says that cast less is a tissue that cancels love what that's what it's

1236
01:31:46,860 --> 01:31:53,820
translated okay what the hell weird very weird and here's some stuff that you

1237
01:31:53,820 --> 01:31:58,660
know like some how should I say it about hidden plus and sudden plus here's

1238
01:31:58,660 --> 01:32:05,500
something interesting mm-hmm um on hidden plus and plus you can actually

1239
01:32:05,500 --> 01:32:15,500
You can actually change the width of the cover, not only before the song begins, but also during gameplay by holding the start button and adjusting it with a turntable.

1240
01:32:16,500 --> 01:32:22,500
Weird. So you can actually adjust the windows that you're hiding or, you know, either way. That's kind of neat.

1241
01:32:23,500 --> 01:32:27,500
Yeah. Not only before the song starts, but during gameplay.

1242
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:32,760
Wow, that's kind of cool. I like that. So like if you decide that oh a little too much on the sudden thing

1243
01:32:32,760 --> 01:32:36,960
Or maybe I put it on accidentally then I could just use the start button to like take it off

1244
01:32:37,440 --> 01:32:42,400
By rolling it so much that it would just not be there. That's kind of neat. Yeah, and then

1245
01:32:43,100 --> 01:32:49,360
There's already a new way of accessing the extra stage, which is a scream squad by cap

1246
01:32:50,600 --> 01:32:52,600
mm-hmm and

1247
01:32:52,600 --> 01:32:57,000
the way you do it is on the first and second stage you have to double A and

1248
01:32:57,000 --> 01:33:01,720
another of any level with hard mode oh so you can get the extra stage that way

1249
01:33:01,720 --> 01:33:08,120
just by double laying in another on hard I'm not done yet oh okay on the final

1250
01:33:08,120 --> 01:33:13,280
stage you have to double a a level 10 or higher either in hyper or another with

1251
01:33:13,280 --> 01:33:21,000
hard mode no random no mirror and that's to get the one more extra stage no that's

1252
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
That's how you get the extra stage.

1253
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:26,000
Really? Oh, dang. So they just raised the bar on that, basically.

1254
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:27,000
More complicated, yeah.

1255
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:37,000
Usually on the previous 2DX styles, like until 2DX Red, you just double A Level 8 another with hard mode.

1256
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:38,000
Wow.

1257
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:41,000
That's the simplest way, but now they made it more complicated.

1258
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
Well, that's because people are getting too good at the game.

1259
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:46,000
You can say that.

1260
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:53,000
Okay, so up in the challenge factor a little bit there, so if you get that extra stage, you're even more special and more crazy.

1261
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
But that's cool. Very cool.

1262
01:33:55,000 --> 01:34:03,000
Let me correct myself here. One of the Happy Sky songs, I said it on a previous, before the song was released,

1263
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:10,000
it's by a dance man featuring disco. The correct title is we are disco yotsu uchi inochi.

1264
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
That's a fun little name to it, okay.

1265
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:16,000
So wait, that was one that we had misnamed on a previous show?

1266
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:19,000
Actually, I mispronounced it.

1267
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:23,000
Wow, you mispronounced something for a change. That's a change.

1268
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:24,000
Usually I'm the one making those mistakes.

1269
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:25,000
I'm not perfect, you know.

1270
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:29,000
That's alright. Neither am I. At least now we know.

1271
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:32,000
Well, thank you for issuing that correction. That was very honest of you.

1272
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
I wish the regular media could be that way.

1273
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:37,000
Anything else you want to share with us about the 2DX world?

1274
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:51,880
Well, just to name some artists, I'll just name them the artists that have songs.

1275
01:34:51,880 --> 01:35:02,820
Don't Let It Go by Uchi's, Uchi the Brothers, and then there's Spark by Silver Fox Productions

1276
01:35:02,820 --> 01:35:10,660
featuring Hoshino Kanako, and then there's Under the Sky by Minami Sayaka from B4U with

1277
01:35:10,660 --> 01:35:20,660
Platonix. What else? Yeah, there's Happy Angel by Junpichi Takirik, or Tahiri, and then there's

1278
01:35:22,660 --> 01:35:24,980
These are more songs that are in Happy Sky, yes?

1279
01:35:24,980 --> 01:35:28,900
Yeah, the ones that have Japanese characters that you might not understand.

1280
01:35:28,900 --> 01:35:30,500
Gotcha, okay, okay.

1281
01:35:30,500 --> 01:35:37,500
And then there's Garden by Aokiriye. I'll just type them after, you know, after this, after this call.

1282
01:35:37,500 --> 01:35:38,500
Works for me.

1283
01:35:38,500 --> 01:35:45,500
Yeah, whenever there are sound titles, just point me out and I'll type them in.

1284
01:35:45,500 --> 01:35:46,500
Sounds good.

1285
01:35:46,500 --> 01:35:47,500
Yeah.

1286
01:35:47,500 --> 01:35:50,500
Alrighty. Well, thanks for the call, Siggy. We appreciate it.

1287
01:35:50,500 --> 01:35:51,500
Alright.

1288
01:35:51,500 --> 01:35:52,500
Have a good one.

1289
01:35:52,500 --> 01:35:53,500
Alright, later.

1290
01:35:53,500 --> 01:35:54,500
Later.

1291
01:35:54,500 --> 01:35:56,500
That's our resident 2DX whore, Siggy.

1292
01:35:56,500 --> 01:35:57,500
Yay, whore.

1293
01:35:57,500 --> 01:36:04,460
calling us I was I was gonna load the it's so much fun clip again but I think

1294
01:36:04,460 --> 01:36:10,700
we've really got it the ground you're right what's so much fun playing the

1295
01:36:10,700 --> 01:36:14,900
clip over and over is that yes actually it is tons of fun somebody said they

1296
01:36:14,900 --> 01:36:20,380
were gonna make a YTM ND comm site out of that you know what that that's the

1297
01:36:20,380 --> 01:36:26,180
site where um oh the one I think of is the the con one have you seen that site

1298
01:36:26,180 --> 01:36:29,000
It just repeats that file over and over.

1299
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:30,000
Con!

1300
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:31,000
Con!

1301
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:34,840
And that's the background is the, you know, William Shatner going, ah!

1302
01:36:34,840 --> 01:36:35,840
Somebody was going to make a site.

1303
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:42,600
And you know how, like, now they have this site where you can build your own YTMND site?

1304
01:36:42,600 --> 01:36:45,300
Somebody's going to build one of those for you, going to, oh, it's so much fun.

1305
01:36:45,300 --> 01:36:46,300
Oh, it's so much fun.

1306
01:36:46,300 --> 01:36:47,300
It'll be hilarious.

1307
01:36:47,300 --> 01:36:48,300
Anyway, we got another call on Skype.

1308
01:36:48,300 --> 01:36:49,300
That sounds like a winner.

1309
01:36:49,300 --> 01:36:51,140
Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio.

1310
01:36:51,140 --> 01:36:56,380
I'm sorry, but I have to do a little rant here about the whole hot coffee thing.

1311
01:36:56,380 --> 01:36:58,520
You have to introduce yourself first.

1312
01:36:58,520 --> 01:36:59,760
I'm Reznor.

1313
01:36:59,760 --> 01:37:03,240
Hi, Reznor. Reznor calls us quite a bit. The resident drunk.

1314
01:37:03,240 --> 01:37:08,020
Hey, we like that. I was the resident drunk last night, but I'm okay now.

1315
01:37:08,020 --> 01:37:09,260
Sorry, but

1316
01:37:09,260 --> 01:37:12,160
the whole media finding...

1317
01:37:12,160 --> 01:37:15,220
the media is basically behind the times on anything that

1318
01:37:15,220 --> 01:37:19,500
relates to anything related with a computer or a video game.

1319
01:37:19,500 --> 01:37:23,820
all hot shit you know there's sex in a video game we can't have this

1320
01:37:23,820 --> 01:37:27,380
but it's fine all right to have people doing drive-bys and uh... shooting

1321
01:37:27,380 --> 01:37:29,200
people as big you know

1322
01:37:29,200 --> 01:37:32,980
and ripping off heads violence is quite alright but doing somebody and the

1323
01:37:32,980 --> 01:37:34,220
asses

1324
01:37:34,220 --> 01:37:38,540
what this this just goes back to what is acceptable in our rated movies as well i

1325
01:37:38,540 --> 01:37:41,940
mean you remember the whole stink with that movie eyes wide shut where

1326
01:37:41,940 --> 01:37:44,780
although they're going to show some titties and some penises and it's going

1327
01:37:44,780 --> 01:37:46,340
to be n c seventeen

1328
01:37:46,340 --> 01:37:50,400
but meanwhile the latest like terminator three where they just blow shit up left

1329
01:37:50,400 --> 01:37:51,080
and right

1330
01:37:51,080 --> 01:37:53,400
is you know just a relatively mild are

1331
01:37:53,400 --> 01:37:58,020
uh... exactly this is a decent point of of horrendous violence being killed

1332
01:37:58,020 --> 01:37:59,660
completely accepted would be

1333
01:37:59,660 --> 01:38:04,040
dead alive or in a movie this guy is fighting zombies with the

1334
01:38:04,040 --> 01:38:08,420
frickin lawnmower strapped to his own many runs up to a man chops them in half

1335
01:38:08,420 --> 01:38:10,800
not to mention the fact that he is also

1336
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:12,200
re uh...

1337
01:38:12,200 --> 01:38:16,920
deeper by his demon mother sucked right into her vagina and then pulled right

1338
01:38:16,920 --> 01:38:18,060
the hell back out

1339
01:38:18,060 --> 01:38:21,400
i happen to have a lot to know

1340
01:38:21,400 --> 01:38:26,960
so i i i think i think this is what i mean that many night at my house

1341
01:38:26,960 --> 01:38:31,080
anyway it was not segway well i don't get a lot of and while you're at

1342
01:38:31,080 --> 01:38:33,800
there was a finishes dot right

1343
01:38:33,800 --> 01:38:35,200
i'm sorry but

1344
01:38:35,200 --> 01:38:39,540
the media are complete idiots when it comes to anything technological

1345
01:38:39,540 --> 01:38:40,520
anything

1346
01:38:40,520 --> 01:38:44,800
uh... the you know story on podcasting oh it's so much

1347
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:49,220
but uh... and i just had a local story and local news is like

1348
01:38:49,220 --> 01:38:53,200
kids are attending these new parties called land parties

1349
01:38:53,200 --> 01:38:58,580
where they come together for twenty four hours of caffeine fuel uh... fun

1350
01:38:58,580 --> 01:39:01,180
playing very violent games and

1351
01:39:01,180 --> 01:39:03,580
swapping the files back and forth

1352
01:39:03,580 --> 01:39:08,740
hello we've been doing this crap since what nineteen ninety five it's just now

1353
01:39:08,740 --> 01:39:10,320
reaching the media

1354
01:39:10,320 --> 01:39:13,920
Play your collective heads out of your asses for a change!

1355
01:39:13,920 --> 01:39:19,040
Oh my god! I remember the LAN forum, because that's the only way you could play like Doom 2

1356
01:39:19,040 --> 01:39:21,600
multiplayer was to do the LAN thing.

1357
01:39:21,600 --> 01:39:27,760
Yeah, doing dial-up and then having phone calls like five hundred dollars. I remember playing 11 player Duke Nukem 3D on the LAN.

1358
01:39:27,760 --> 01:39:30,800
Oh, that's right, Duke Nukem is another one. Anyway.

1359
01:39:30,800 --> 01:39:32,320
But, I'm sorry, but

1360
01:39:32,320 --> 01:39:36,520
the media is just such horrors. I'd like to round, as I said in the chat room,

1361
01:39:36,520 --> 01:39:40,840
I'd like to round them all up in a pit and re-enact the scene from HUD where they're

1362
01:39:40,840 --> 01:39:42,200
shooting the cattle.

1363
01:39:42,200 --> 01:39:46,120
It's such bullshit!

1364
01:39:46,120 --> 01:39:49,920
You know what amazes me about this whole thing is that Grand Theft Auto is a

1365
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:53,080
bit of a scapegoat because it's not like we have never had

1366
01:39:53,080 --> 01:39:57,080
sex or very very sexual things in games before.

1367
01:39:57,080 --> 01:40:01,960
This could go all the way back to Custer's Revenge. Now granted Custer's Revenge

1368
01:40:01,960 --> 01:40:03,200
was not a

1369
01:40:03,200 --> 01:40:06,760
a runaway sales hit, shall we say,

1370
01:40:06,760 --> 01:40:09,760
and neither was Night Trap, even though that game didn't have sex in it,

1371
01:40:09,760 --> 01:40:12,960
but God of War has a sex minigame in it.

1372
01:40:12,960 --> 01:40:16,080
I think the only reason that they're scapegoating, you know,

1373
01:40:16,080 --> 01:40:20,440
Grand Theft Auto is because it's been, you know, in the spotlight before.

1374
01:40:20,440 --> 01:40:23,800
I'm surprised they didn't start whipping out Doom 3 and just saying,

1375
01:40:23,800 --> 01:40:27,120
oh, there's, you know, there's demonology and rituals,

1376
01:40:27,120 --> 01:40:30,800
and, you know, there's blood all over the place. But that's okay, because that's blood.

1377
01:40:30,800 --> 01:40:36,320
Exactly, but they're only scapegoating GTA because it was in the spotlight before

1378
01:40:36,320 --> 01:40:41,840
and they just want to rile up the collection of Bible thumping parents out there

1379
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:46,960
and say, oh look, there's titties and a money shot. Ignore the fact that you can

1380
01:40:46,960 --> 01:40:50,400
the game says the F word and nigger half the time.

1381
01:40:50,400 --> 01:40:54,840
Yeah, that's great though, too. Like I predicted,

1382
01:40:54,840 --> 01:40:58,320
this is only the beginning. It's the whole nipple gate all over again and as we'll be

1383
01:40:58,320 --> 01:40:59,880
covering in our podcast later,

1384
01:40:59,880 --> 01:41:02,880
They're coming after Sims 2's nude patch now.

1385
01:41:02,880 --> 01:41:06,880
Oh yeah, there's a huge thing that it's appealing to pedophiles.

1386
01:41:06,880 --> 01:41:11,880
Hey Newsflash, there are Ken dolls underneath those blurs.

1387
01:41:11,880 --> 01:41:13,880
There's a huge difference.

1388
01:41:13,880 --> 01:41:15,880
There's nothing there.

1389
01:41:15,880 --> 01:41:16,880
Not on the patch that I have.

1390
01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:18,880
Even the website doesn't even have nipples.

1391
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:21,880
There's a huge difference too between the Sims 2 thing and the Grand Theft Auto thing.

1392
01:41:21,880 --> 01:41:26,880
As I pointed out earlier, I believe the Grand Theft Auto thing to be a case of lazy programming.

1393
01:41:26,880 --> 01:41:33,280
Whereas the Sims 2 thing is somebody made a patch to alter the game.

1394
01:41:33,280 --> 01:41:38,280
They are not putting back in like a pointer that was taken out to code that was on the game.

1395
01:41:38,280 --> 01:41:40,780
They don't do that research. I understand that.

1396
01:41:40,780 --> 01:41:45,280
Next thing you know, you'll have Jerry Falwell saying that because when the males get abducted by aliens

1397
01:41:45,280 --> 01:41:50,280
and become pregnant with alien babies, that it's going to be a great thing for gay rights

1398
01:41:50,280 --> 01:41:52,280
and it's all against Christianity.

1399
01:41:52,280 --> 01:41:56,280
Somebody needs to get up there and explain, you know what, and if this thing ends up coming before Congress,

1400
01:41:56,280 --> 01:42:02,360
which is just just might remember like years ago like 15 years ago it was about the naughty lyrics in music and

1401
01:42:02,620 --> 01:42:07,240
Fucking he got D Snyder from twisted sister testifying before the special congress panel

1402
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:09,240
That's what's gonna happen with this whole thing

1403
01:42:09,240 --> 01:42:15,720
and I hope to God when that happens that they break it down into second grade language for these people so that they understand and

1404
01:42:15,720 --> 01:42:21,000
draw pictures if you have to to understand the difference between what happened with Grantham federal San Andreas and

1405
01:42:21,320 --> 01:42:24,980
People outright making the nude patches for other games. I mean God there

1406
01:42:24,980 --> 01:42:29,580
within like five seconds of the Tomb Raider game being out somebody

1407
01:42:29,580 --> 01:42:32,740
had a patch so you could see Lara Croft's pussy. I mean that's just...

1408
01:42:32,740 --> 01:42:36,980
I still think that our society is so fucked up that

1409
01:42:36,980 --> 01:42:41,480
where you can rip somebody's head off with the spine attached dangly with

1410
01:42:41,480 --> 01:42:42,820
blood dripping off of it

1411
01:42:42,820 --> 01:42:47,280
it's considered alright when a money shot of man goo in the face of a

1412
01:42:47,280 --> 01:42:48,860
woman on her knees is so

1413
01:42:48,860 --> 01:42:54,380
taboo. But to put it in perspective though the spinal cord attached to the

1414
01:42:54,380 --> 01:42:58,740
head thing, and I assume you're referencing Mortal Kombat, I seem to recall that did have

1415
01:42:58,740 --> 01:42:59,740
this whole theory of media detection with it.

1416
01:42:59,740 --> 01:43:01,740
It did, you have a big stink on it.

1417
01:43:01,740 --> 01:43:03,780
That's why it wasn't in the Super Nintendo.

1418
01:43:03,780 --> 01:43:04,780
Right.

1419
01:43:04,780 --> 01:43:05,780
But, now here's the difference.

1420
01:43:05,780 --> 01:43:08,640
They didn't try to ban the game, well, no, they did try to ban the game, but they didn't

1421
01:43:08,640 --> 01:43:13,620
do this whole, oh, I guess the ratings thing was really born because of that.

1422
01:43:13,620 --> 01:43:18,400
And when they went and rated Mortal Kombat M, that seemed to appease the moral police

1423
01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:19,660
a little bit.

1424
01:43:19,660 --> 01:43:23,780
basically what it's basically boiling down to is

1425
01:43:23,780 --> 01:43:27,100
their society is just basically not taking

1426
01:43:27,100 --> 01:43:30,400
taking the blame or taking responsibility for their own kids the

1427
01:43:30,400 --> 01:43:33,420
parents basically just want to sit them down in front of the idiot box

1428
01:43:33,420 --> 01:43:35,180
and then it makes it though

1429
01:43:35,180 --> 01:43:37,500
you know it's because the parents aren't

1430
01:43:37,500 --> 01:43:41,540
you know watching out for what their kids play what they watch what they do

1431
01:43:41,540 --> 01:43:42,760
on the internet

1432
01:43:42,760 --> 01:43:45,900
that when something like this in grand theft auto happens

1433
01:43:45,900 --> 01:43:47,620
or heavens forbid you know

1434
01:43:47,620 --> 01:43:52,400
Doom caught a lot of shit because the whole Columbine thing, I know that it probably

1435
01:43:52,400 --> 01:43:55,920
strums somebody's strings the wrong way with that.

1436
01:43:55,920 --> 01:43:57,800
But damn it, Doom's not the problem.

1437
01:43:57,800 --> 01:43:59,680
Dran Theft Auto is not the problem.

1438
01:43:59,680 --> 01:44:02,280
It's parents that aren't doing their damn job.

1439
01:44:02,280 --> 01:44:04,520
I'll bet you anything here is what happens about this.

1440
01:44:04,520 --> 01:44:07,880
Because parents are lazy and can't figure out how to do these things themselves,

1441
01:44:07,880 --> 01:44:09,640
remember what they had to do for televisions.

1442
01:44:09,640 --> 01:44:13,840
That it's mandatory that the V-chip be installed in all television sets so that

1443
01:44:13,840 --> 01:44:19,840
that you can block programs above a certain rating if you want to.

1444
01:44:19,840 --> 01:44:23,840
So that way parents could still leave their kids unattended and the TV does the babysitting for them.

1445
01:44:23,840 --> 01:44:28,840
The only problem with that is the parents are half stupid about even they can't even work the VCR

1446
01:44:28,840 --> 01:44:31,840
at the time and the kids have already figured a way to hack around the VTIMS.

1447
01:44:31,840 --> 01:44:33,840
I'm not going to disagree with you there.

1448
01:44:33,840 --> 01:44:39,840
But I bet you anything as a result of this, it's going to be required in these next-gen systems

1449
01:44:39,840 --> 01:44:41,840
that they do some similar type of...

1450
01:44:41,840 --> 01:44:47,040
I really crazy they already have that it's already in the PlayStation 2

1451
01:44:47,040 --> 01:44:50,560
it's already on the PSP it's already on the Xbox they're pre-programmed in there

1452
01:44:50,560 --> 01:44:54,240
but guess what nobody knows about it because exactly because they don't

1453
01:44:54,240 --> 01:44:57,680
they're not responsible parents just like you know even if this game is adults

1454
01:44:57,680 --> 01:45:00,640
only kids are still going to be playing it because their dumbass parents

1455
01:45:00,640 --> 01:45:03,680
go and buy it for them you know what I hope happens

1456
01:45:03,680 --> 01:45:07,800
here's what I hope happens the game gets rated adults only fuck it let's do

1457
01:45:07,800 --> 01:45:09,040
whatever the fuck we want

1458
01:45:09,040 --> 01:45:15,180
I want to have it where the main character goes and rapes babies, and it sets people on fire.

1459
01:45:15,180 --> 01:45:18,860
Fuck it, you know what? I can do it now because it is an adults-only game.

1460
01:45:18,860 --> 01:45:21,740
So fuck you, can't say shit, adults only.

1461
01:45:21,740 --> 01:45:26,300
You just make a game that says, fuck your children, this is adults only.

1462
01:45:26,300 --> 01:45:33,800
I want to be able to ride around in a car that has a collective of child heads lined up on the front of the car for the grill,

1463
01:45:33,800 --> 01:45:38,360
and also have a rocket launcher that fires chickens butt-first out of it

1464
01:45:38,360 --> 01:45:42,640
towards little old ladies that are carrying groceries and if you happen to knock one old lady

1465
01:45:42,640 --> 01:45:48,120
into another and her head gets stuck up to her butt, you get a bonus score

1466
01:45:48,120 --> 01:45:49,200
wow

1467
01:45:49,200 --> 01:45:49,960
uh...

1468
01:45:49,960 --> 01:45:51,180
but look

1469
01:45:51,180 --> 01:45:56,080
here's the problem though with the AO you know we're going to have this adults only orgy

1470
01:45:56,080 --> 01:45:57,320
of games now

1471
01:45:57,320 --> 01:46:01,060
the thing is is that the targets uh... not really the targets but they're

1472
01:46:01,060 --> 01:46:05,060
are a part of it. The Walmarts of the world, the Best Buys of the world, the Game Stops

1473
01:46:05,060 --> 01:46:10,580
and... Oh, don't even get me started on stupid fucking Walmarts. All these stores, all the

1474
01:46:10,580 --> 01:46:13,900
big stores are going to pull, they're not going to have these games because they're

1475
01:46:13,900 --> 01:46:17,940
the equivalent of porn. So the only way you're going to ever find these AO games is in the

1476
01:46:17,940 --> 01:46:23,020
back room of some video clearance center run down shack. Hey, time for the mom and pops

1477
01:46:23,020 --> 01:46:26,060
to come back. You know, what if these big store chains don't want to carry the hot games

1478
01:46:26,060 --> 01:46:30,060
out there with people, go to other places and find them. That's what the Internet's

1479
01:46:30,060 --> 01:46:32,060
for. It's a wired world out there.

1480
01:46:32,060 --> 01:46:33,060
Exactly. Fuck Walmart.

1481
01:46:33,060 --> 01:46:36,060
Who cares? No one buys games anymore anyways. They're always pirating them off the internet.

1482
01:46:36,060 --> 01:46:39,060
You can probably end up buying them out of vending machines in Japan.

1483
01:46:39,060 --> 01:46:44,820
Yeah, so I want to buy an adults only game right next to being able to buy beer and sweaty

1484
01:46:44,820 --> 01:46:53,820
girls panties. Shit, I'm out of beer.

1485
01:46:53,820 --> 01:46:57,060
can't say we necessarily disagree with you you've got you bring an interesting

1486
01:46:57,060 --> 01:47:00,720
perspective to it and I'll tell you what you you should be a game designer because

1487
01:47:00,720 --> 01:47:05,760
I think the the raping grandma game or whatever you had here going on here was

1488
01:47:05,760 --> 01:47:12,840
pretty hot and I'd buy it raping grandmas three with the new raccoon tail

1489
01:47:12,840 --> 01:47:19,320
power-up it's the grandma game cuz you could fuck grandma across the Oregon

1490
01:47:19,320 --> 01:47:21,640
all right here

1491
01:47:21,640 --> 01:47:25,640
you just want to work in the words oregon trail into the show didn't you

1492
01:47:25,640 --> 01:47:29,080
and i don't really want to let you know you're right

1493
01:47:29,080 --> 01:47:31,360
that that the game that you're talking about

1494
01:47:31,360 --> 01:47:34,320
public separate two thousand

1495
01:47:34,320 --> 01:47:36,760
actually yes it does

1496
01:47:36,760 --> 01:47:38,560
can you imagine it yet

1497
01:47:38,560 --> 01:47:42,080
can you imagine do you can you imagine the grandma game though where they've

1498
01:47:42,080 --> 01:47:43,080
got you know

1499
01:47:43,080 --> 01:47:47,080
all here's grandma number one it's a mod and uh...

1500
01:47:47,080 --> 01:47:51,080
Hey, Grandma Maude, answer this question. You gotta flash your titties.

1501
01:47:51,080 --> 01:47:56,080
Whoa, whoa, okay, that's what the one instance I agree against porn.

1502
01:47:56,080 --> 01:48:00,080
You say Maude, and I think of Bea Arthur now.

1503
01:48:00,080 --> 01:48:03,080
So that's scary, because she had that show.

1504
01:48:03,080 --> 01:48:07,080
And then you have the movie Airheads, it's like, I want naked pictures of Bea Arthur.

1505
01:48:07,080 --> 01:48:10,080
And it's like, no you don't, no you don't.

1506
01:48:10,080 --> 01:48:14,080
All right, all kidding aside, you bring up some good points, Reznor,

1507
01:48:14,080 --> 01:48:16,920
and uh... i hope america's listening

1508
01:48:16,920 --> 01:48:20,240
uh... long live u s a all right now

1509
01:48:20,240 --> 01:48:22,560
uh... any other final thoughts for us

1510
01:48:22,560 --> 01:48:25,940
uh... now i'll save it for the f-use sounds good to me thank you for being a

1511
01:48:25,940 --> 01:48:26,840
friend

1512
01:48:26,840 --> 01:48:28,800
okay have a good one

1513
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:29,960
uh...

1514
01:48:29,960 --> 01:48:32,320
you're the kind of thing we encourage

1515
01:48:32,320 --> 01:48:36,740
and i'm not the real and then just let's into the uh...

1516
01:48:36,740 --> 01:48:38,360
one more call

1517
01:48:38,360 --> 01:48:40,640
higher on all of us radio

1518
01:48:40,640 --> 01:48:45,040
Loki for president, please. I nominate Loki for president. That was just awesome.

1519
01:48:45,040 --> 01:48:48,280
Oh, come on. His ego doesn't need any more of that, please.

1520
01:48:48,280 --> 01:48:51,320
Hey, you could be vice president, Doc Sucker could be the first lady.

1521
01:48:51,320 --> 01:48:56,080
No, I'm the need dictator.

1522
01:48:56,080 --> 01:48:57,820
I'm the Illuminati!

1523
01:48:57,820 --> 01:49:01,360
Jamie would be evil dictator of the country that would start

1524
01:49:01,360 --> 01:49:05,380
World War III with Loki's country. That's kind of how it would work, so...

1525
01:49:05,380 --> 01:49:10,360
Right now, I want her and Hillary Clinton in a ring, three minutes, no polls,

1526
01:49:10,360 --> 01:49:12,360
No TQ match, that's what I want.

1527
01:49:12,360 --> 01:49:15,360
I keep taking out the brass knucks and breaking her face.

1528
01:49:15,360 --> 01:49:20,360
Wow! I'm glad this is uncensored radio, because we could get an AO right now.

1529
01:49:20,360 --> 01:49:22,360
Bitch, no you didn't!

1530
01:49:22,360 --> 01:49:25,360
Fuck that bullshit, just bring it on.

1531
01:49:25,360 --> 01:49:31,360
I was going to say, I was going to run that clip again.

1532
01:49:31,360 --> 01:49:34,360
Loki, what do you think about running for president? Oh, it's so fun.

1533
01:49:34,360 --> 01:49:37,360
But, um, I'm too lazy to queue up the clip again.

1534
01:49:37,360 --> 01:49:40,360
So, what else is on your mind, my friend?

1535
01:49:40,360 --> 01:49:47,360
This is Ron John, by the way, and a lot of crazy things have been happening to me the last couple of days, the last two, three days.

1536
01:49:47,360 --> 01:49:51,360
Like, what kinds of crazy things, like...

1537
01:49:51,360 --> 01:49:56,360
I didn't forget it. I was going to make a sitcom reference or something. Forget it.

1538
01:49:56,360 --> 01:49:59,360
What kinds of crazy things?

1539
01:49:59,360 --> 01:50:05,360
Let's say I might order a package for a friend of mine for a birthday gift. It shows up the day after the party.

1540
01:50:05,360 --> 01:50:10,360
Um, my family just went into utter turmoil right now, so...

1541
01:50:10,360 --> 01:50:11,360
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

1542
01:50:11,360 --> 01:50:15,360
Oh, you don't know how...oh, well, I'll probably PM you that later, but um...

1543
01:50:15,360 --> 01:50:16,360
Okay.

1544
01:50:16,360 --> 01:50:20,360
On the good side, I just found out there's going to be an anime con in Sacramento this weekend.

1545
01:50:20,360 --> 01:50:25,360
I heard about some anime con that's going to be at the mall or something, right?

1546
01:50:25,360 --> 01:50:26,360
Oh, goody! Not that one again!

1547
01:50:26,360 --> 01:50:29,360
I sent Jamie the information already.

1548
01:50:29,360 --> 01:50:32,360
You know what? Remember the last time?

1549
01:50:32,360 --> 01:50:36,360
I saw the email and then I got bombarded, so, sorry.

1550
01:50:36,360 --> 01:50:38,360
It's okay.

1551
01:50:38,360 --> 01:50:40,360
Remember the last time I went to that thing?

1552
01:50:40,360 --> 01:50:45,360
I'm afraid of anime cons in a mall.

1553
01:50:45,360 --> 01:50:50,360
It was okay. It was basically a bunch of vendors getting together to sell shit. I mean, it was okay.

1554
01:50:50,360 --> 01:50:52,360
The typical sunrise fest.

1555
01:50:52,360 --> 01:50:57,360
The video room was the old McDonald's that is converted into, like, every store possible.

1556
01:50:57,360 --> 01:50:59,360
That was pretty funny, I have to admit.

1557
01:50:59,360 --> 01:51:07,360
Anime Cons of the Mall, I got you beat. My anime cosplay club had like a little picnic in Central Park last weekend.

1558
01:51:07,360 --> 01:51:12,360
We came across another cosplaying group known as the Naruto Crack Crew.

1559
01:51:12,360 --> 01:51:17,360
They came in full Naruto cosplay gear and we're just staring at them.

1560
01:51:17,360 --> 01:51:20,360
Wow, that's awesome.

1561
01:51:20,360 --> 01:51:24,360
I mean, I wore my forehead protector and that was it.

1562
01:51:24,360 --> 01:51:29,640
I mean, no more Naru tarts, please. God, no.

1563
01:51:29,640 --> 01:51:34,960
Wow, um, we might go check out the con. My only problem is that I'm actually flying out

1564
01:51:34,960 --> 01:51:38,060
to the East Coast on Sunday, which I think is the day that the majority of the con is

1565
01:51:38,060 --> 01:51:43,760
taking place, so I don't know if I personally can go, but maybe my esteemed co-presenters

1566
01:51:43,760 --> 01:51:44,960
can go. Go where?

1567
01:51:44,960 --> 01:51:50,200
I'll think about it. The, the, um, the anime con at the mall. Go hand out flyers for our

1568
01:51:50,200 --> 01:51:52,600
show. I'll go buy a pretzel, because I like their

1569
01:51:52,600 --> 01:51:54,600
There you go. There you go.

1570
01:51:54,600 --> 01:51:56,600
Get me a box of tofu.

1571
01:51:56,600 --> 01:51:58,600
Are you still meeting me when I come out to the East Coast?

1572
01:51:58,600 --> 01:52:03,600
Yes, a few of my friends are going to get together after the tournament. We want to drag you off to a diner.

1573
01:52:03,600 --> 01:52:04,600
Sounds good to me.

1574
01:52:04,600 --> 01:52:05,600
Yeah.

1575
01:52:05,600 --> 01:52:09,600
Alright, as long as I'm back at the East now, because I do have to work the next day, but yes, I do that.

1576
01:52:09,600 --> 01:52:10,600
It's a full problem.

1577
01:52:10,600 --> 01:52:11,600
Alright.

1578
01:52:11,600 --> 01:52:13,600
We'll keep the alcohol to a minimum, okay?

1579
01:52:13,600 --> 01:52:15,600
Sounds good to me, because I have a low tolerance.

1580
01:52:15,600 --> 01:52:16,600
Alright.

1581
01:52:16,600 --> 01:52:17,600
Excellent.

1582
01:52:17,600 --> 01:52:18,600
Anything else you want to share with us today?

1583
01:52:18,600 --> 01:52:23,240
Can I get a request of Let's Groove, my tips and tricks, please?

1584
01:52:23,240 --> 01:52:25,040
I will try and work it in a little later.

1585
01:52:25,040 --> 01:52:26,040
Sweet.

1586
01:52:26,040 --> 01:52:27,880
Send me a private message so I don't forget.

1587
01:52:27,880 --> 01:52:28,880
I will.

1588
01:52:28,880 --> 01:52:29,880
All right.

1589
01:52:29,880 --> 01:52:30,880
Later, my friend.

1590
01:52:30,880 --> 01:52:31,880
Later.

1591
01:52:31,880 --> 01:52:32,880
Bye-bye.

1592
01:52:32,880 --> 01:52:33,880
All right.

1593
01:52:33,880 --> 01:52:35,160
Good calls tonight, boys and girls.

1594
01:52:35,160 --> 01:52:36,440
We appreciate...

1595
01:52:36,440 --> 01:52:38,000
We like our intelligent listeners.

1596
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:41,360
This is what really motivates us to do what we do here.

1597
01:52:41,360 --> 01:52:42,360
All right.

1598
01:52:42,360 --> 01:52:44,620
And now something that takes no intelligence whatsoever.

1599
01:52:44,620 --> 01:52:46,500
The Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match.

1600
01:52:46,500 --> 01:52:52,300
In tonight's cage match, three songs will do battle.

1601
01:52:52,300 --> 01:52:53,460
Whoops, where'd Halleck go?

1602
01:52:53,460 --> 01:52:54,300
There we go.

1603
01:52:54,300 --> 01:52:56,460
Three songs will do battle in tonight's cage match.

1604
01:52:56,460 --> 01:52:58,100
Last week's winner, you get a clip of it,

1605
01:52:58,100 --> 01:52:59,740
two brand new songs.

1606
01:52:59,740 --> 01:53:02,840
Your votes in the chat room at orangeloungeradio.com,

1607
01:53:02,840 --> 01:53:05,880
clicking on chat, will determine the winner.

1608
01:53:05,880 --> 01:53:08,200
And the winning song goes into rotation all week long

1609
01:53:08,200 --> 01:53:09,620
on Orange Lounge Radio Live,

1610
01:53:09,620 --> 01:53:11,540
the London Music and More program.

1611
01:53:11,540 --> 01:53:15,780
All right, first up we get last week's winner,

1612
01:53:15,780 --> 01:53:17,780
last week in the Orange Lounge Cage Match,

1613
01:53:17,780 --> 01:53:21,340
a very interesting spin on a 70s classic one

1614
01:53:21,340 --> 01:53:22,860
and it was kind of one of those moments

1615
01:53:22,860 --> 01:53:25,180
where Dark Soccer and I went, huh?

1616
01:53:25,180 --> 01:53:26,860
But you guys voted for it.

1617
01:53:26,860 --> 01:53:29,580
You voted for Loki's pick of Ozzy Osbourne

1618
01:53:29,580 --> 01:53:31,340
with Stayin' Alive, so it comes back

1619
01:53:31,340 --> 01:53:32,940
as song number one this week.

1620
01:53:32,940 --> 01:53:35,140
Here's a clip, Ozzy Osbourne, Stayin' Alive.

1621
01:54:35,140 --> 01:54:37,140
It's alright, it's okay

1622
01:54:37,140 --> 01:54:39,140
We may go the other way

1623
01:54:39,140 --> 01:54:41,140
But we can't fight, we want the same

1624
01:54:41,140 --> 01:54:45,140
Cause we don't tried to make the man

1625
01:54:48,140 --> 01:54:50,140
It's alright, it's okay

1626
01:54:50,140 --> 01:54:53,140
I'll let you see us navigate

1627
01:54:53,140 --> 01:54:55,140
But we can't fight, we want the same

1628
01:54:55,140 --> 01:54:58,140
It's your time to think of me

1629
01:55:25,140 --> 01:55:32,900
All right, that was song number one in tonight's cage match. Ozzy Osbourne was staying alive.

1630
01:55:32,900 --> 01:55:35,900
All right, song number two in tonight's cage match. We're going to do my pick for song

1631
01:55:35,900 --> 01:55:40,180
number two. And I've decided to pick this group. It's somebody I got turned on to by

1632
01:55:40,180 --> 01:55:43,820
a friend who just saw them live recently. And I went and downloaded some of their stuff

1633
01:55:43,820 --> 01:55:48,280
on iTunes and I really dug it. So I wanted to share one of their songs with you guys.

1634
01:55:48,280 --> 01:55:52,660
They have one of those funny foreign names. I think they're Icelandic. So I might mispronounce

1635
01:55:52,660 --> 01:55:56,700
the band name and I if I do I apologize you know all those Icelandic bands have

1636
01:55:56,700 --> 01:56:01,960
a really funny names like Bjork no it's Bjork but it's actually pronounced

1637
01:56:01,960 --> 01:56:05,400
Bjork but everybody says Bjork and then there's what Sigurjós and all those

1638
01:56:05,400 --> 01:56:10,480
bands too Sigurjós or whatever Figaro oh my god they should have like all

1639
01:56:10,480 --> 01:56:14,660
the Icelandic bands do like one song together not all three of them not to

1640
01:56:14,660 --> 01:56:17,720
make fun of Icelandic bands because there's actually some pretty kick-ass

1641
01:56:17,720 --> 01:56:29,560
music from Iceland. It's just funny names. So anyway, this band is Royksop, and the song

1642
01:56:29,560 --> 01:56:33,560
is called Only This Moment, and it's song number two in tonight's cage match. Enjoy.

1643
01:56:59,560 --> 01:57:17,880
Nothing else there, no one to guide us Lost in the senses, deep down inside

1644
01:57:17,880 --> 01:57:20,880
I'm inside, I know I'm about to die

1645
01:57:47,880 --> 01:58:02,880
We are lost in confusion Feelings of the skin of the ocean

1646
01:58:02,880 --> 01:58:06,380
In the end, she'll stay on the sidewalk

1647
01:58:06,380 --> 01:58:08,380
On the sidewalk

1648
01:58:23,680 --> 01:58:26,680
Stay your forever girl

1649
01:58:27,480 --> 01:58:30,480
Play all you never know

1650
01:58:30,480 --> 01:58:38,480
We're heaven-denided, you can't deny us It's all you've been waiting for

1651
01:58:38,480 --> 01:58:46,480
Okay, stay your forever kind Play your never mind

1652
01:58:46,480 --> 01:58:54,480
Your spirit's divided, you will desire It's the more you've been waiting for

1653
01:58:54,480 --> 01:59:00,480
I held in my head, held in my heart, and was raised by the voice of the nature

1654
01:59:00,480 --> 01:59:06,480
Feeling and facing everything exactly I do understand

1655
01:59:06,480 --> 01:59:10,480
Finding love is a path of again

1656
01:59:10,480 --> 01:59:15,480
Voices within me expressing the last thought of creation exactly

1657
01:59:15,480 --> 01:59:21,480
I might think it was cross-hairs, but might lose it by taking the chance

1658
01:59:21,480 --> 01:59:25,480
And so I'm not here about pain, it's just a video

1659
01:59:25,480 --> 01:59:26,480
Okay

1660
01:59:26,480 --> 01:59:29,480
We'll be the most conscious together

1661
01:59:29,480 --> 01:59:31,480
Close to perfection

1662
01:59:31,480 --> 01:59:33,480
We'll be the thing that I'll say

1663
01:59:33,480 --> 01:59:37,480
Always be the trust in my senses

1664
01:59:37,480 --> 01:59:39,480
Do you know what I'm saying?

1665
01:59:39,480 --> 01:59:41,480
We'll be so fine

1666
01:59:41,480 --> 01:59:45,480
We'll be the most conscious together

1667
01:59:45,480 --> 01:59:47,480
Close to perfection

1668
02:00:17,480 --> 02:00:31,800
All right, that was song number two in tonight's cage match.

1669
02:00:31,800 --> 02:00:35,040
That was Roiksop with Only This Moment.

1670
02:00:35,040 --> 02:00:39,320
Let's see if the other folks in the room liked it or didn't.

1671
02:00:39,320 --> 02:00:40,400
Dark Sakura.

1672
02:00:40,400 --> 02:00:43,640
I liked it, but it was probably something I'd listen to if I was trying to go to sleep

1673
02:00:43,640 --> 02:00:46,000
or like working on a picture or something.

1674
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:51,240
very good oh it gets me Loki actually kind of like that I would give it any as

1675
02:00:51,240 --> 02:00:57,640
well Jonas explicit I'll give it like an 8.5 on this one I actually like the

1676
02:00:57,640 --> 02:01:03,360
tunes kind of like you might be back in the 8-bit days because of those tunes

1677
02:01:03,360 --> 02:01:08,260
yeah that's how I like about it it makes me feel relaxed and stuff it gives up a

1678
02:01:08,260 --> 02:01:15,160
bad day very cool usually I would give that song a 9.5 but because the band has

1679
02:01:15,160 --> 02:01:18,520
a hard to pronounce name, I'm giving it a 9. I'm docking it a half point for a crazy

1680
02:01:18,520 --> 02:01:27,360
name. I don't care if it has cultural relevance. Shame shame. It's all good, don't worry. Alright.

1681
02:01:27,360 --> 02:01:30,640
What song are you putting in the Cage Match tonight, Dark Sakura? It's a song we freaking

1682
02:01:30,640 --> 02:01:36,520
should have had in rotation a long time ago, which I was afraid it already was. We have

1683
02:01:36,520 --> 02:01:42,320
a different version, like a different mix. Like the crap version. Yeah. I am a big fan

1684
02:01:42,320 --> 02:01:48,080
of the best move series I always have been I can kick anybody's asses on this

1685
02:01:48,080 --> 02:01:53,360
game challenge me I swear I will own you I challenge you you know I'll own you I

1686
02:01:53,360 --> 02:01:58,200
challenge you on air duel on the first one I used to have all the commands

1687
02:01:58,200 --> 02:02:03,360
memorized I would play without them Wow on on a bust of well for me it was

1688
02:02:03,360 --> 02:02:08,720
busted grooved because I was raised on the u.s. one that is what I played

1689
02:02:08,720 --> 02:02:14,040
non-stop before DDR so I think we would probably have to do like we would just

1690
02:02:14,040 --> 02:02:18,960
get perfect scores all the time it would be it would be a tough match over that

1691
02:02:18,960 --> 02:02:23,040
way all right um anyway this is from the first one it's kitty ends theme song

1692
02:02:23,040 --> 02:02:26,880
from the Japanese one so it's the good version and that the one trying to sound

1693
02:02:26,880 --> 02:02:33,360
like the real McCoy it's I forgot who exactly was a singer on it but it was it

1694
02:02:33,360 --> 02:02:43,360
It actually made top 10 in the charts in Japan, from what I understand, and it's a big Avextrax song, so, uh, it's, uh, I'll show it in a knife.

1695
02:02:43,360 --> 02:02:47,360
Alright, here it is. Song number three. It's an ice cage match.

1696
02:03:43,360 --> 02:03:45,360
Oh

1697
02:04:13,360 --> 02:04:23,360
Uchi, shikare, denmo, nakana, yoyo, ni, menure, ri, ri, yoyo, ni

1698
02:04:29,360 --> 02:04:35,360
Boi, asmaruto ni nishino shimonaku

1699
02:07:05,360 --> 02:07:25,380
Well, where did, where did Hollick go?

1700
02:07:25,380 --> 02:07:26,380
Here it is.

1701
02:07:26,380 --> 02:07:27,380
There we go.

1702
02:07:27,380 --> 02:07:28,380
That was weird.

1703
02:07:28,380 --> 02:07:29,380
Sorry guys.

1704
02:07:29,380 --> 02:07:30,880
That was song number three in tonight's cage match.

1705
02:07:30,880 --> 02:07:37,420
You might know that song from Busted Move, Kitty N's stage, but we're calling it by Avex,

1706
02:07:37,420 --> 02:07:41,660
it's Aosora no Night, Dark Sakura, what do you think?

1707
02:07:41,660 --> 02:07:47,020
And actually, it was pointed out to me that the file actually ripped wrong with the name,

1708
02:07:47,020 --> 02:07:48,020
it's Aozora.

1709
02:07:48,020 --> 02:07:49,020
Oh.

1710
02:07:49,020 --> 02:07:57,660
But, at any rate, yeah, I love that song, I've loved that song forever, it gets an 11.

1711
02:07:57,660 --> 02:07:59,980
Alright, Loki.

1712
02:07:59,980 --> 02:08:06,200
it was 11, but it was okay. I mean, I'd give it a 7. I mean, it sounds just like the original

1713
02:08:06,200 --> 02:08:13,200
one to me. It is the original one. It sounds like the English one, okay? It doesn't matter.

1714
02:08:13,500 --> 02:08:19,880
It's okay. It's just okay. Jonas, I don't see the big difference between the English

1715
02:08:19,880 --> 02:08:24,740
version too much, but except that the Japanese is a little better, but I would say it's 8.

1716
02:08:24,740 --> 02:08:29,220
I like that song a lot. I wish we had had that version of it in our bus to move, but

1717
02:08:29,220 --> 02:08:33,500
we didn't but it's getting it's kind of I don't know it's kind of old that's the

1718
02:08:33,500 --> 02:08:36,060
only thing it has really going against it is that song's kind of been out a

1719
02:08:36,060 --> 02:08:40,940
while but it's still a good song I give it an 8 as well all right let's recap

1720
02:08:40,940 --> 02:08:44,580
the three songs you kids can vote for tonight in the cage match and then you

1728
02:09:35,760 --> 02:09:39,840
Loki, this is usually the part of the show where I ask you what's going on in the sim scene as if

1729
02:09:39,840 --> 02:09:41,040
you're paying any attention to it.

1730
02:09:41,040 --> 02:09:44,520
I am paying attention to it. I check Bomani's sale

1731
02:09:44,520 --> 02:09:48,120
every day. Okay. From where

1732
02:09:48,120 --> 02:09:51,840
We already talked about Trinity Mix and how we don't care.

1733
02:09:51,840 --> 02:09:55,440
Yeah, last Trinity Mix, in case you missed it last week,

1734
02:09:55,440 --> 02:09:57,120
is coming out pretty soon.

1735
02:09:57,120 --> 02:10:01,400
Get your files in if you really want to participate.

1736
02:10:01,400 --> 02:10:05,360
And then that's on ddrei.com.

1737
02:10:05,360 --> 02:10:11,840
And then, of course, the DDROSC competition, the

1738
02:10:11,840 --> 02:10:16,160
psychopath edition, which is all funny files, that was

1739
02:10:16,160 --> 02:10:17,800
judged and I think is over with.

1740
02:10:17,800 --> 02:10:22,240
and nothing else going on

1741
02:10:22,240 --> 02:10:25,520
familiar maybe we should be going to join us for the fifth day i think that

1742
02:10:25,520 --> 02:10:27,680
came out a while ago

1743
02:10:27,680 --> 02:10:31,080
i believe

1744
02:10:31,080 --> 02:10:35,080
to mix you

1745
02:10:35,080 --> 02:10:36,480
he doesn't know

1746
02:10:36,480 --> 02:10:42,200
he doesn't know all right kids cheese

1747
02:10:42,200 --> 02:10:44,280
you retired from the same scene

1748
02:10:44,280 --> 02:10:45,780
You're not making your crazy ass simp files?

1749
02:10:45,780 --> 02:10:51,780
There is a guy that actually posted a song file that said that he made it, I think it was a max remix, that said by Xplicit.

1750
02:10:53,280 --> 02:10:54,280
What the hell?

1751
02:10:54,280 --> 02:10:54,780
Serious?

1752
02:10:55,280 --> 02:10:56,280
I don't make this up.

1753
02:10:57,280 --> 02:10:58,280
Interesting, uh...

1754
02:10:58,280 --> 02:11:05,780
Interesting, I remember this before someone sent, like, two simp files in to be my style, and...

1755
02:11:06,280 --> 02:11:09,280
Ah, but I gotta hammer them too hard, so...

1756
02:11:10,780 --> 02:11:12,280
Except we got some...

1757
02:11:12,280 --> 02:11:13,780
Well, I can't say the word noob.

1758
02:11:13,780 --> 02:11:17,060
Who's that someone else but the put a name explicit alpha?

1759
02:11:17,620 --> 02:11:23,140
Because I'm explicit gamma on the be my install is that some guy named explicit alphas and a follicle

1760
02:11:23,700 --> 02:11:27,540
Legend of transfer doesn't for hello. That's the same person. I just have

1761
02:11:28,240 --> 02:11:31,220
various alpha Beta Gamma Delta Ana was next

1762
02:11:33,020 --> 02:11:35,020
That is all

1763
02:11:36,260 --> 02:11:39,900
All right while I'm tallying up the cage match votes over here

1764
02:11:39,900 --> 02:11:47,580
Why don't you fill us in on some of the other lovely programming we have here on Orange

1765
02:11:47,580 --> 02:11:48,580
Launch Radio.

1766
02:11:48,580 --> 02:11:49,580
At least the one other show we have right now.

1767
02:11:49,580 --> 02:11:50,580
One other show.

1768
02:11:50,580 --> 02:11:56,340
On Tuesdays, pre-show starting at a quarter to seven, show starting at seven thirty.

1769
02:11:56,340 --> 02:11:59,100
That's Pacific time for everybody else.

1770
02:11:59,100 --> 02:12:03,020
We have Pump Up the Volume, which is a music request show in theory, although I pretty

1771
02:12:03,020 --> 02:12:06,900
much just submit, you know, everybody the whatever I want to play for them.

1772
02:12:06,900 --> 02:12:09,660
It goes on to about ten thirty.

1773
02:12:09,660 --> 02:12:13,860
And I'd like to catch everybody up on This Week in Max Remixes.

1774
02:12:14,860 --> 02:12:34,660
Starting with Maximum, with three X's, by mochi13, we have Max300, the MSG remix, by fearofthedragon, Requiem for Max, Max100, MaxTakedown, MaxRelord...

1775
02:12:34,660 --> 02:12:37,780
Why re-lord? What the hell? That doesn't make any sense.

1776
02:12:37,780 --> 02:12:41,700
Re-lord, okay, max cremation, max dominator.

1777
02:12:41,700 --> 02:12:46,500
Ummm, zephyr, max speedmix,

1778
02:12:46,500 --> 02:12:51,900
max frances, and max 300 period, max hold.

1779
02:12:51,900 --> 02:12:55,540
Stop.

1780
02:12:55,540 --> 02:13:01,660
Just, just stop people. But there's one though, I swear.

1781
02:13:01,660 --> 02:13:07,900
And I know it's one I downloaded just to check it out. Let's see what it was.

1782
02:13:07,900 --> 02:13:13,840
Max Takedown. And they say that the friend says,

1783
02:13:13,840 --> 02:13:18,300
This is a version of Max that my friend Explicit made.

1784
02:13:18,300 --> 02:13:21,020
What the hell?

1785
02:13:21,020 --> 02:13:24,280
Wow.

1786
02:13:24,280 --> 02:13:29,060
Wow. Just wow. There's only one Explicit.

1787
02:13:29,060 --> 02:13:31,800
The one and only, I guess. With three X's, or what?

1788
02:13:31,800 --> 02:13:36,260
Yeah, three X's. And it's with a Z, not a C.

1789
02:13:36,260 --> 02:13:39,260
Which is interesting, I gotta check this out.

1790
02:13:39,260 --> 02:13:42,560
In a way, just because I'm curious.

1791
02:13:42,560 --> 02:13:45,700
But now, but then, speaking of that, something brought up the idea of

1792
02:13:45,700 --> 02:13:49,460
The Legend of Vertex.

1793
02:13:49,460 --> 02:13:53,460
Because they try to fuse In the Groove and DDR together, so that

1794
02:13:53,460 --> 02:13:57,740
they come up with this. Actually, I found this great new remix of Max recently.

1795
02:13:57,740 --> 02:13:59,740
It's a really good max mix.

1796
02:14:01,740 --> 02:14:03,740
This is a good max mix, huh?

1797
02:14:03,740 --> 02:14:05,740
Oh wait, I'm just kidding. That's Energizer from In the Group 2.

1798
02:14:07,740 --> 02:14:09,740
That joke never gets old.

1799
02:14:09,740 --> 02:14:11,740
Alright.

1800
02:14:13,740 --> 02:14:15,740
Let's go to the cage match winner, shall we?

1801
02:14:15,740 --> 02:14:17,740
You want to know who won tonight's cage match?

1802
02:14:17,740 --> 02:14:19,740
You can't handle who won tonight's cage match!

1803
02:14:19,740 --> 02:14:21,740
Why not?

1804
02:14:21,740 --> 02:14:23,740
Alright, the winner in tonight's cage match.

1805
02:14:23,740 --> 02:14:25,740
Very, very close.

1806
02:14:25,740 --> 02:14:32,740
battle tonight, but in the end, one song squeaked by to win it, and it's the song from BustaMove.

1807
02:14:32,740 --> 02:14:43,100
Who knew that there were so many fanboys and fangirls in there for BustaMove? Very, very

1808
02:14:43,100 --> 02:14:47,980
close with the Royscoff song, though. Very, very close. Which is unusual for my song to

1809
02:14:47,980 --> 02:14:52,700
get that many votes, so. Damn you, Dark Sakura. Damn you to heck.

1810
02:14:52,700 --> 02:14:53,700
It never sounds better.

1811
02:14:53,700 --> 02:14:54,700
I know.

1812
02:14:54,700 --> 02:14:55,700
It's all right.

1813
02:14:55,700 --> 02:15:01,060
I won't take it personally.

1814
02:15:01,060 --> 02:15:02,060
Let's go to a break, shall we?

1815
02:15:02,060 --> 02:15:03,060
I promised a break.

1816
02:15:03,060 --> 02:15:04,060
Hi.

1817
02:15:04,060 --> 02:15:05,060
Can we break things?

1818
02:15:05,060 --> 02:15:07,220
I unlocked the first picture in this wonderful game I'm playing.

1819
02:15:07,220 --> 02:15:08,220
That this is the one.

1820
02:15:08,220 --> 02:15:09,220
I'm playing Gals Panic.

1821
02:15:09,220 --> 02:15:10,340
No, I'm not playing Gals Panic.

1822
02:15:10,340 --> 02:15:14,660
I'm playing Peek-a-boo-pooker for the NES, one of the few adult games.

1823
02:15:14,660 --> 02:15:15,660
Is that like Bubble Bath Babes?

1824
02:15:15,660 --> 02:15:17,660
Made by the same company.

1825
02:15:17,660 --> 02:15:21,620
Anyways, it says, hi, I'm Full House Francine.

1826
02:15:21,620 --> 02:15:26,420
Are you feeling lucky tonight? Want to fill up my house?

1827
02:15:26,420 --> 02:15:29,280
And this is like the worst graphics in the world.

1828
02:15:29,280 --> 02:15:32,140
This is what they need to be coming after.

1829
02:15:32,140 --> 02:15:37,580
These really sick games for the Nintendo Entertainment System.

1830
02:15:37,580 --> 02:15:38,580
Bad Nintendo.

1831
02:15:38,580 --> 02:15:39,580
Alright.

1832
02:15:39,580 --> 02:15:44,500
We're going to go to a break, you guys, and this song here, we're going to start it off

1833
02:15:44,500 --> 02:15:45,900
with a special dedication.

1834
02:15:45,900 --> 02:15:51,580
This is Let's Groove from DDR Max, and Ron Chan wanted to hear this one, so we're dedicating

1835
02:15:51,580 --> 02:15:58,580
it to him. And here it is. Enjoy.

1836
02:16:51,580 --> 02:16:57,580
Alright, let's just go

1837
02:16:57,580 --> 02:17:02,580
Stand up, stand up, stand up, alright

1838
02:17:02,580 --> 02:17:05,580
Let's just go, how do we do

1839
02:17:05,580 --> 02:17:09,580
Alright, alright, alright

1840
02:17:09,580 --> 02:17:12,580
Let's just go, stay in shoes

1841
02:17:12,580 --> 02:17:17,580
We should stand up alright, alright

1842
02:18:12,580 --> 02:18:14,580
Oh

1843
02:18:42,580 --> 02:19:10,580
I just know it's real Don't you want to see it again?

1844
02:19:10,580 --> 02:19:16,580
I'm going to go back into reality

1845
02:19:16,580 --> 02:19:20,580
I'm very jealous of this statistic

1846
02:19:20,580 --> 02:19:24,580
I've decided to let it go

1847
02:19:24,580 --> 02:19:30,580
I've decided to let it go

1848
02:21:30,580 --> 02:21:59,580
I want to live, I want to live, I want to live the way I've been on and on for a long, long time.

1849
02:22:29,580 --> 02:22:38,580
No matter how far I go, I'll be your friend on every day.

1850
02:22:38,580 --> 02:22:41,580
I'll be your friend.

1851
02:22:41,580 --> 02:22:58,980
Mr. Random Person on the Street, who by the way is not an actor, what do you think of

1852
02:22:58,980 --> 02:23:01,260
the Orange Drowned Spam on a music and more show?

1853
02:23:01,260 --> 02:23:08,820
The music is like being transported to just this dancing spaceship place.

1854
02:23:08,820 --> 02:23:11,060
It's unearthly.

1855
02:23:11,060 --> 02:23:14,980
like being in a club except you don't have to, you know, actually ask someone to dance.

1856
02:23:14,980 --> 02:23:19,380
Hi, we're back here on Orange Lounge Radio. We're going to get into the FUs of the week very soon so

1857
02:23:19,380 --> 02:23:24,020
you kids might want to start sending in your angst over private message and we'll get to those. Try

1858
02:23:24,020 --> 02:23:27,140
to keep them short tonight though because there's a lot of active people participating in the show

1859
02:23:27,140 --> 02:23:31,380
now. We had a lot of cage match votes tonight so that means that the FUs are going to need to be

1860
02:23:31,380 --> 02:23:35,140
somewhat short so if you send me a long one I'm going to cut it up. Jonas, that goes double for

1861
02:23:35,140 --> 02:23:39,140
you. I know you haven't been here in a while. I know you got some stored up. Are you going to cut

1862
02:23:39,140 --> 02:23:43,420
cut it up like they cut me up in the interview? Yes, I will cut you up just like they cut

1863
02:23:43,420 --> 02:23:47,700
up Loki's interview. Remember, I cut myself in with two beats of titties. Alright, yeah,

1864
02:23:47,700 --> 02:23:53,220
that's right. Alright, moving on. First, before we get to the FUs of the Week, though, Loki

1865
02:23:53,220 --> 02:23:56,440
wanted me to talk about this because he's like, Rob, you have to talk about this story

1866
02:23:56,440 --> 02:24:02,420
I posted, so fine. DJ Maxx, it's his Korean online rhythm music game and it's going to

1867
02:24:02,420 --> 02:24:07,380
be coming out for the PSP. Tell us a little more about DJ Maxx, Loki. DJ Maxx was by the

1868
02:24:07,380 --> 02:24:12,740
The creators of Easy to DJ, those may not remember, Easy to DJ was the actual competitor

1869
02:24:12,740 --> 02:24:14,720
for Beatmania out there.

1870
02:24:14,720 --> 02:24:20,260
It was five key with turntables, kind of set up like Beatmania 2DX where the turntables

1871
02:24:20,260 --> 02:24:21,680
are on the outside.

1872
02:24:21,680 --> 02:24:24,880
Also had foot pedals on it, just like Beatmania 3.

1873
02:24:24,880 --> 02:24:30,780
So this game's coming out now, DJ Maxx, it's only five key, I believe it's only five key

1874
02:24:30,780 --> 02:24:36,320
and no turntable, no actually I take that back, seven key, no turntable.

1875
02:24:36,320 --> 02:24:41,080
But the songs are awesome, they're by the same artist that we're in, Easy to DJ, and

1876
02:24:41,080 --> 02:24:42,400
the quality is just really good.

1877
02:24:42,400 --> 02:24:46,840
It's an online game right now, but it is coming, well they have a cell phone version I guess,

1878
02:24:46,840 --> 02:24:49,180
but this one's coming to the PSP.

1879
02:24:49,180 --> 02:24:53,520
Is it going to suck as much as like Beatmania on Game Boy?

1880
02:24:53,520 --> 02:24:54,520
I don't think so.

1881
02:24:54,520 --> 02:24:58,940
I think the way they can do it, because it's just five key presses, so I'm sure they can

1882
02:24:58,940 --> 02:25:02,820
map it out in some way that'll make sense.

1883
02:25:02,820 --> 02:25:05,880
They should do the type of thing where you can turn it like on its side, so you can see

1884
02:25:05,880 --> 02:25:07,880
the notes coming down better. That would be kind of neat.

1885
02:25:07,880 --> 02:25:10,880
They did that on Wonderswan. See, that would be cool.

1886
02:25:10,880 --> 02:25:13,880
They might be. It doesn't look like the way they set it up because it's going to be set

1887
02:25:13,880 --> 02:25:18,880
up with your play field on the left-hand side of the screen and video on the right.

1888
02:25:18,880 --> 02:25:23,880
So, I think what they could do, though, is have add-on peripherals for it because by

1889
02:25:23,880 --> 02:25:27,880
that time, I'm sure they will already have the PSP keyboard because that's going to be

1890
02:25:27,880 --> 02:25:32,880
coming out with version 2.0 of the firmware, which is, what, next week.

1891
02:25:32,880 --> 02:25:37,680
Is that the white PSP coming out at that same time too?

1892
02:25:37,680 --> 02:25:39,320
No, the white PSP is coming out in September.

1893
02:25:39,320 --> 02:25:41,520
It will be built in with firmware 2.0.

1894
02:25:41,520 --> 02:25:46,880
Didn't you say you were going to buy two just so you could have your old emulator PSP?

1895
02:25:46,880 --> 02:25:52,160
Yeah, I wanted to buy two just because of that, because I'm curious to see what I want

1896
02:25:52,160 --> 02:25:57,120
to do is if the PSP looks like it can download files, and if it can download audio files,

1897
02:25:57,120 --> 02:25:58,760
it can download our podcast.

1898
02:25:58,760 --> 02:26:01,960
If it can download our podcast, I'm going to make a PSP page where you can download

1899
02:26:01,960 --> 02:26:06,720
The podcast will be formatted for the PSP and whatnot, special content, that type of thing.

1900
02:26:06,720 --> 02:26:08,400
Interesting.

1901
02:26:08,400 --> 02:26:10,600
So, but this looks really cool.

1902
02:26:10,600 --> 02:26:14,480
First, like, rhythm music game that I think is coming, well, unless you count Luminous,

1903
02:26:14,480 --> 02:26:17,220
but that's not really a rhythm music game.

1904
02:26:17,220 --> 02:26:18,320
It's more of a puzzle game.

1905
02:26:18,320 --> 02:26:22,720
But this is going to be coming out, no word on yet what's coming over here.

1906
02:26:22,720 --> 02:26:28,400
If it's coming out over here, you know, in Korea, though, and they've announced it on their website,

1907
02:26:28,400 --> 02:26:30,000
so we'll just have to wait.

1908
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:33,520
but looks cool so far from the video I've seen.

1909
02:26:33,520 --> 02:26:35,520
Alrighty.

1910
02:26:35,520 --> 02:26:39,160
Let's get into the FUs of the week. It's our chance to get a little bit

1911
02:26:39,160 --> 02:26:42,560
angry because we have a lot of anger built up inside ourselves, as you saw

1912
02:26:42,560 --> 02:26:44,200
Loki earlier in the program.

1913
02:26:44,200 --> 02:26:46,960
Um, alright.

1914
02:26:46,960 --> 02:26:48,420
DarkSakura,

1915
02:26:48,420 --> 02:26:51,640
this is all happening because of you. This was all your idea, your

1916
02:26:51,640 --> 02:26:54,700
your big evil empire that you've built since episode one.

1917
02:26:54,700 --> 02:26:58,560
Why is it that we have to do these FUs of the week every single week?

1918
02:26:58,560 --> 02:27:05,560
go

1919
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:09,920
humongous

1920
02:27:09,920 --> 02:27:14,600
at the ages

1921
02:27:14,600 --> 02:27:16,440
per step you that microphone

1922
02:27:16,440 --> 02:27:17,660
fucking up again

1923
02:27:17,660 --> 02:27:23,360
what the horse after a place to dampen contract net what about my plan i bought

1924
02:27:23,360 --> 02:27:24,720
we could always sub that in

1925
02:27:24,720 --> 02:27:26,660
yeah i will have a look

1926
02:27:26,660 --> 02:27:28,460
It's right there behind you.

1927
02:27:28,460 --> 02:27:30,020
Is it plugged in?

1928
02:27:30,020 --> 02:27:32,820
No, I can just take the top off of it.

1929
02:27:32,820 --> 02:27:35,100
First you have to go through technical difficulties.

1930
02:27:35,100 --> 02:27:41,520
Hold on a sec.

1931
02:27:41,520 --> 02:27:44,000
There we go. Much better.

1932
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:47,860
Bye bye, piece of shit microphone!

1933
02:27:47,860 --> 02:27:52,060
Anyway, F you to the microphone. F you to work.

1934
02:27:52,060 --> 02:27:54,600
Specifically, and now keep in mind,

1935
02:27:54,600 --> 02:28:06,360
I bore my co-workers, my boss is pretty cool, but just a good manager should not let their

1936
02:28:06,360 --> 02:28:10,320
stress bleed onto their employees, right?

1937
02:28:10,320 --> 02:28:13,680
That's been happening.

1938
02:28:13,680 --> 02:28:16,800
And I have been getting all stressed out at work, and it's not good if I get all stressed

1939
02:28:16,800 --> 02:28:17,800
out.

1940
02:28:17,800 --> 02:28:21,800
Thursday I went home sick with a combination of fatigue, low blood sugar, and a pretty

1941
02:28:21,800 --> 02:28:24,360
high level of stress.

1942
02:28:24,360 --> 02:28:30,480
I ended up having a venti green tea frappuccino, which I finished in twice the time Dan finished

1943
02:28:30,480 --> 02:28:35,920
his, and I still let down at 9 o'clock and didn't wake up until 2, when he came home

1944
02:28:35,920 --> 02:28:41,400
with his new car, which is a model up to mine and brand new, but my car still looks better.

1945
02:28:41,400 --> 02:28:42,400
I digress.

1946
02:28:42,400 --> 02:28:49,280
That's really it, really it, and also, oh yeah, as to how expensive the furniture we

1947
02:28:49,280 --> 02:28:51,320
want is, okay I'm done.

1948
02:28:51,320 --> 02:28:56,320
Alright, let's move on to Loki's FUs of the Week.

1949
02:28:56,320 --> 02:28:59,320
Yeah, uh, it's so fun.

1950
02:28:59,320 --> 02:29:02,320
Um, the first FUs of the Week goes to KCRA3.

1951
02:29:02,320 --> 02:29:09,320
Okay, now, I have to preface this with, um, the fact Brian, the interviewer, alright, he was great.

1952
02:29:09,320 --> 02:29:12,320
Okay, the reporter was awesome, the cameraman was awesome.

1953
02:29:12,320 --> 02:29:16,320
Just whoever edited the damn thing, not awesome, okay?

1954
02:29:16,320 --> 02:29:20,320
They really need to learn we're better than heat, okay?

1955
02:29:20,320 --> 02:29:26,440
okay so no plug they fucking suck for that and the fact that they cut this

1956
02:29:26,440 --> 02:29:30,720
like really stupid clip of me talking saying it's so fun you know don't even

1957
02:29:30,720 --> 02:29:35,180
put me in it at all okay cuz at least I don't look like a fucking idiot thank

1958
02:29:35,180 --> 02:29:40,320
you very much I'm definitely gonna have some written contract for the next

1959
02:29:40,320 --> 02:29:46,440
person interviews us there's gonna be some serious issues huh anyways so fuck

1960
02:29:46,440 --> 02:29:51,760
you to that. Fuck you stupid people that are driving too damn slow, especially people from

1961
02:29:51,760 --> 02:29:57,760
Arizona. Like this woman today, uh, it was like, I don't even remember what it was, it

1962
02:29:57,760 --> 02:30:04,520
was like, like, old, old toot or something like that, is what the license plate said.

1963
02:30:04,520 --> 02:30:11,240
It was just like, you know, old fart or something, old toot, you know, I'm like, okay, so I think

1964
02:30:11,240 --> 02:30:15,360
it was actually this old guy. When we drove by him, the guy looked like he was a corpse

1965
02:30:15,360 --> 02:30:45,240
This is what you do, you tell them it's a health hazard.

1966
02:30:45,240 --> 02:30:47,240
They'll be on it fast!

1967
02:31:15,240 --> 02:31:44,240
I'd like to give an F you to 12 hour work days like the one I had on Friday. That kind of sucks because I came home and I napped for a long time and then I was ended up staying up to like four in the morning because my sleep schedule was just all screwed up. So, but don't get me wrong. I love my job. Just I could do without the 12 hour work days. If I could do my job eight hours evenly every day, I'd be fine. So if I could do my job eight hours, I'd be fine.

1968
02:31:44,240 --> 02:31:48,240
So, oh well, I guess it comes with the territory.

1969
02:31:48,240 --> 02:31:52,240
And F.U. to the fact that I have to travel soon, because I'm going to miss being here

1970
02:31:52,240 --> 02:31:56,240
for two weeks, and it's just going to, it makes it hard to do a podcast

1971
02:31:56,240 --> 02:32:00,240
every single week when I'm not going to be here and trying to do a three hour show

1972
02:32:00,240 --> 02:32:04,240
as well, you know, I'd like to be here for that. So, general angst

1973
02:32:04,240 --> 02:32:08,240
to leaving and then going to an area that's going to be, you know,

1974
02:32:08,240 --> 02:32:12,240
it's not like I'm going to Disneyland, people.

1975
02:32:12,240 --> 02:32:18,800
oh well, it comes with the territory. Um, and then, um, an F you to the fact that when

1976
02:32:18,800 --> 02:32:23,120
I tried to play 2DX 6 style and 3rd style earlier this week, they wouldn't work with

1977
02:32:23,120 --> 02:32:26,240
my component cables for some reason. I can't figure out if that's a resolution thing or

1978
02:32:26,240 --> 02:32:30,200
what the hell is going on. So F you to me being a technological idiot when it comes

1979
02:32:30,200 --> 02:32:36,080
to the new TV. But otherwise, um, I love my new TV. It's so pretty. Um, oh, and F you

1980
02:32:36,080 --> 02:32:42,600
to how bad I suck at Halo 2. That's all. Moving on to the one and only explicit. Alright,

1981
02:32:42,600 --> 02:32:48,920
I'll keep it quick and quick summaries, alright? FU to the whole adults only for GTA, like

1982
02:32:48,920 --> 02:32:54,280
everybody already mentioned a while ago, and the fact that the ESRB is gonna kill sales

1983
02:32:54,280 --> 02:33:01,280
for all those M or AO games. Look what you did. And FU goes to the neighbors for blaming

1984
02:33:01,280 --> 02:33:06,720
neighbors for blaming us for killing their plants over water issues. First of all, we

1985
02:33:06,720 --> 02:33:12,200
didn't spill any water or leak any water out of nowhere. Second of all, is it even our

1986
02:33:12,200 --> 02:33:19,200
house that was leaking water? And if he goes to the spot being broken still, I still get

1987
02:33:19,440 --> 02:33:26,440
a hot tub massage. And if he goes to my tail bump being all fucked up, I gotta check on

1988
02:33:26,440 --> 02:33:28,440
I gotta go check on the doctor for that one.

1989
02:33:29,440 --> 02:33:32,440
And Epic goes to Manfay on Anime Expo.

1990
02:33:33,440 --> 02:33:35,440
Oh my god, Manfay is back?

1991
02:33:35,440 --> 02:33:37,440
Yes, he is back.

1992
02:33:37,440 --> 02:33:41,440
I saw Manfay at FanaMe a few years ago.

1993
02:33:42,440 --> 02:33:46,440
A guy who cosplays as Faye, and he's really hairy.

1994
02:33:47,440 --> 02:33:52,440
And I don't mean hairy as in scary, although yeah he is scary, but I mean hairy as in covered in fur like a bear.

1995
02:33:52,440 --> 02:33:53,440
fair.

1996
02:33:53,440 --> 02:33:59,520
Surprisingly, he didn't get arrested, but he's banned from Anime Expo, but he's almost

1997
02:33:59,520 --> 02:34:06,200
mooned and stuck his ass up with my friend who tried to tag on his shoe.

1998
02:34:06,200 --> 02:34:15,200
I've only ever once seen good cosplay as in a guy cosplaying a girl, and that was a really

1999
02:34:15,200 --> 02:34:19,560
pretty pretty guy cosplaying Utena from the movie.

2000
02:34:19,560 --> 02:34:20,960
A pretty guy.

2001
02:34:20,960 --> 02:34:22,960
a really pretty guy.

2002
02:34:50,960 --> 02:34:54,960
Who's to blame here?

2003
02:34:54,960 --> 02:35:02,960
Uh, let's see. In Fv2, stupid little kid just stepped on my foot.

2004
02:35:02,960 --> 02:35:05,960
It might be really this big.

2005
02:35:05,960 --> 02:35:07,960
And...

2006
02:35:07,960 --> 02:35:10,960
I'm not gonna make a comment.

2007
02:35:10,960 --> 02:35:14,960
And, because I want to make sure I don't get cut off, I'll say do be continuous.

2008
02:35:14,960 --> 02:35:16,960
Actually, one more, there's one more.

2009
02:35:16,960 --> 02:35:22,960
Uh, and if, a big, a big, if it goes to the whole tournament drama that was leading to the, to the pit tournament.

2010
02:35:22,960 --> 02:35:26,960
Oh yeah, you wanted to ban some guy, that didn't make me happy.

2011
02:35:26,960 --> 02:35:32,960
I was, yeah, I couldn't, even though I couldn't, in a, in a bad way, it damaged my reputation in a way.

2012
02:35:32,960 --> 02:35:35,960
Well not you, don't take it personally, it's not you, it's the other guy.

2013
02:35:35,960 --> 02:35:38,960
He needs to go out, he needs to be publicly spanked.

2014
02:35:39,960 --> 02:35:40,960
He might like that though.

2015
02:35:40,960 --> 02:35:45,960
I wonder what's going to happen in the tournament. That's all I want to know.

2016
02:35:45,960 --> 02:35:48,960
You know I got to back Toady up, no matter what happens.

2017
02:35:48,960 --> 02:35:52,960
I know the band decision was uncalled for.

2018
02:35:52,960 --> 02:35:55,960
That's why I put everything up to make sure in a peaceful manner.

2019
02:35:55,960 --> 02:35:56,960
Drama!

2020
02:35:56,960 --> 02:35:58,960
Alright. It's cool. It'll be cool.

2021
02:35:58,960 --> 02:36:01,960
Alright, let's move on to the chatroom FUs, shall we?

2022
02:36:01,960 --> 02:36:06,960
And somebody said that this song is so horrid that I had to use this as the background music.

2023
02:36:06,960 --> 02:36:14,960
Let's say Misty wants to say an F.U. to the USB reader on the In the Groove 2, not responding to my card or any other card that was tried.

2024
02:36:14,960 --> 02:36:17,960
Hope it's a problem that can be fixed with just a reboot.

2025
02:36:17,960 --> 02:36:23,960
Sakarina says F.U. to the retard who let my 9 year old brother play Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.

2026
02:36:23,960 --> 02:36:32,960
Acer800 says F.U. to the AC not working for a month and my mom getting mad at me for listening to the F.U.s last week.

2027
02:36:32,960 --> 02:36:38,320
it's not a children's program not saying you're a child but that's only just buy

2028
02:36:38,320 --> 02:36:45,360
headphones okay if you're gonna listen to our naughty language also we have

2029
02:36:45,360 --> 02:36:49,840
Reznor says a nice fuck you to come shots being more risque than shooting

2030
02:36:49,840 --> 02:36:53,480
someone in the ass with a hand cannon

2031
02:36:53,920 --> 02:36:59,000
Sakura sin says f you to Nintendo for not making any good puzzle games lately

2032
02:36:59,000 --> 02:37:01,000
to keep me busy.

2033
02:37:01,000 --> 02:37:02,400
Hello, did you play Meteos?

2034
02:37:02,400 --> 02:37:03,900
Well, I realize Nintendo didn't make that,

2035
02:37:03,900 --> 02:37:05,240
but Meteos is very cool.

2036
02:37:05,240 --> 02:37:07,000
I've gotta recommend that.

2037
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:09,820
Illusion says, F you to cutting my gums a few minutes ago,

2038
02:37:09,820 --> 02:37:11,080
and now they're bleeding.

2039
02:37:12,080 --> 02:37:15,120
And Ron Chan says, F you to the post office.

2040
02:37:15,120 --> 02:37:17,240
It was supposed to come Friday,

2041
02:37:17,240 --> 02:37:18,880
but it came Saturday and I had left.

2042
02:37:18,880 --> 02:37:19,720
Fuck you.

2043
02:37:19,720 --> 02:37:22,560
Oh, and F you to me running out of space on my hard drive.

2044
02:37:24,640 --> 02:37:27,480
That's it for our angsty chat room F yous.

2045
02:37:27,480 --> 02:37:29,320
Yay, all right.

2046
02:37:29,320 --> 02:37:30,680
I wasn't even inked enough, but OK.

2047
02:37:30,680 --> 02:37:35,800
No, it was kind of light on the angst tonight.

2048
02:37:35,800 --> 02:37:37,840
It was angst light, diet angst tonight.

2049
02:37:37,840 --> 02:37:39,440
That's all right.

2050
02:37:39,440 --> 02:37:41,520
OK, what we're going to do now, I

2051
02:37:41,520 --> 02:37:46,680
think we're going to go ahead and go to another break.

2052
02:37:46,680 --> 02:37:48,800
Doo doo doo doo doo.

2053
02:37:48,800 --> 02:37:50,560
We'll make this a quick break.

2054
02:37:50,560 --> 02:37:51,520
Someone wanted to hear.

2055
02:37:51,520 --> 02:37:53,040
There were some songs that folks wanted to hear,

2056
02:37:53,040 --> 02:37:55,180
and I've already forgot what some of them were.

2057
02:37:55,180 --> 02:37:56,640
I think someone wanted to hear System Romance.

2058
02:37:56,640 --> 02:38:00,480
So I'm going to get to System Romance, uh, and I'll get into another song that somebody

2059
02:38:00,480 --> 02:38:01,480
else wanted to hear.

2060
02:38:01,480 --> 02:38:02,480
Mmm.

2061
02:38:02,480 --> 02:38:03,480
What?

2062
02:38:03,480 --> 02:38:04,480
Last Message.

2063
02:38:04,480 --> 02:38:07,880
You want to hear Last Me- Fine, we'll get to Last Message.

2064
02:38:07,880 --> 02:38:12,000
We're going to make this a short break, because we're looking for questions for Ask Orange

2065
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:13,000
Lounge.

2066
02:38:13,000 --> 02:38:16,880
That's right, it's time to Ask Orange Lounge, or tonight you can ask Jonas as well if you

2067
02:38:16,880 --> 02:38:17,880
want to.

2068
02:38:17,880 --> 02:38:20,040
Like, what the hell is that medal that you're wearing around your neck?

2069
02:38:20,040 --> 02:38:21,040
That's what I want to know.

2070
02:38:21,040 --> 02:38:22,520
Do y'all see this, uh, spinner?

2071
02:38:22,520 --> 02:38:23,520
It's a spinner?

2072
02:38:23,520 --> 02:38:27,520
This is what I got from the WWE event. It's the spinner from John Cena.

2073
02:38:27,520 --> 02:38:31,520
Hey, you can't see me. Obfuscate.

2074
02:38:31,520 --> 02:38:35,520
If anyone has ever played live action vampire,

2075
02:38:35,520 --> 02:38:39,520
his little waving his hand in front of his face thing is also the obfuscate action.

2076
02:38:39,520 --> 02:38:43,520
For live action vampire. Oh wow. So, you can't see me.

2077
02:38:43,520 --> 02:38:47,520
Oh, that was the other request. Somebody wanted to hear something from Silent Hills.

2078
02:38:47,520 --> 02:38:51,520
So how about instead we hear some You're Not Here. Is that acceptable to our Sakura?

2079
02:38:51,520 --> 02:38:54,520
Um, okay. Okay.

2080
02:38:54,520 --> 02:38:56,520
You gonna be okay?

2081
02:38:56,520 --> 02:38:58,520
OKAY!

2082
02:38:58,520 --> 02:39:02,520
Alright, so we'll get to that. We'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.

2083
02:41:28,520 --> 02:41:32,520
Oh I hope you're ready to go

2084
02:41:32,520 --> 02:41:35,520
I hope you're ready to go

2085
02:41:35,520 --> 02:41:40,520
I hope you're ready to go

2086
02:41:40,520 --> 02:41:45,520
I hope you're ready to go

2087
02:41:45,520 --> 02:41:48,520
You've got to do it forever

2088
02:41:48,520 --> 02:41:51,520
The grain drops, broken the wind is dead

2089
02:41:51,520 --> 02:41:55,520
And it would be a much better flight

2090
02:41:55,520 --> 02:42:02,520
If you hadn't let me, I'd be fine on my own, baby

2091
02:42:02,520 --> 02:42:08,520
Never felt so lonely then you came along

2092
02:42:08,520 --> 02:42:11,520
So now what should I do?

2093
02:42:11,520 --> 02:42:15,520
I'm strung out, addicted to you

2094
02:42:15,520 --> 02:42:18,520
My body aches, now that you're gone

2095
02:42:18,520 --> 02:42:23,520
My supply fell through

2096
02:42:23,520 --> 02:42:28,520
Glad they gave me everything you had and more

2097
02:42:28,520 --> 02:42:30,520
It craves my happiness

2098
02:42:30,520 --> 02:42:34,520
When you made me feel joy and made you smile

2099
02:42:34,520 --> 02:42:37,520
But now I feel your stress

2100
02:42:37,520 --> 02:42:42,520
Love was never meant to be such a crazy affair, no

2101
02:42:42,520 --> 02:42:44,520
And who has time but you?

2102
02:42:44,520 --> 02:42:50,520
Never thought I'd sit around and unravel your love

2103
02:42:50,520 --> 02:43:04,880
Oh hi, dead air because I forgot to put in a promo there.

2104
02:43:04,880 --> 02:43:05,880
We're back.

2105
02:43:05,880 --> 02:43:10,520
Listen to Orange Laund Radio or we eat your liver.

2106
02:43:10,520 --> 02:43:11,520
There you go.

2107
02:43:11,520 --> 02:43:13,640
There you go, that's a good promo.

2108
02:43:13,640 --> 02:43:14,640
Good enough for me.

2109
02:43:14,640 --> 02:43:18,340
Alright, we're going to get into a little segment now where we let you guys control

2110
02:43:18,340 --> 02:43:23,700
the show and ask us whatever you want within reason though people within

2111
02:43:23,700 --> 02:43:27,300
reason please don't ask about our naughty bits because we're not going to

2112
02:43:27,300 --> 02:43:30,780
talk about those well at least I don't feel like talking about mine but who

2113
02:43:30,780 --> 02:43:33,940
knows who knows what kind of mode we're in all right here we go

2114
02:43:33,940 --> 02:43:43,540
that's going to launch time let's ask orange lounge some stupid question what

2115
02:43:43,540 --> 02:43:48,100
will we find out this week on orange lounge radio what will the court chat

2116
02:43:48,100 --> 02:43:54,100
will it be a g-rated question? I really hope so, because this show's already too much AO.

2117
02:43:54,100 --> 02:43:57,100
Ha, that was cool.

2118
02:44:05,100 --> 02:44:09,100
Ah, da-da-da-da-da-da. Let's see, uh, Tomo-kun wants to know,

2119
02:44:09,100 --> 02:44:16,100
why was 180 mode pissed away on Para-para dancing and not in Para-para paradise?

2120
02:44:16,100 --> 02:44:21,100
I'm assuming that's when you can turn around and do Para Para the other way?

2121
02:44:21,100 --> 02:44:24,100
So people can actually watch you doing the dancing?

2122
02:44:24,100 --> 02:44:27,100
I didn't play enough Para Para to follow that stuff, I have to admit.

2123
02:44:27,100 --> 02:44:30,100
I thought it was cute for like a week, but...

2124
02:44:30,100 --> 02:44:31,100
Do you know anything about that?

2125
02:44:31,100 --> 02:44:32,100
No.

2126
02:44:32,100 --> 02:44:33,100
Oh.

2127
02:44:33,100 --> 02:44:34,100
I don't know.

2128
02:44:34,100 --> 02:44:38,100
You know, sometimes they just take modes out.

2129
02:44:38,100 --> 02:44:41,100
But if you look up, aren't there only sensors on the front part of it?

2130
02:44:41,100 --> 02:44:44,100
Don't they not have sensors on the back part of a Para Para machine?

2131
02:44:44,100 --> 02:44:45,100
I don't remember.

2132
02:44:45,100 --> 02:44:49,060
no they don't but you could probably put one there you can mount it I guess you

2133
02:44:49,060 --> 02:44:54,900
could flip it around if you wanted to but you know oh well sorry don't know

2134
02:44:54,900 --> 02:44:59,820
enough about part part answer your question boy do we suck or what moving

2135
02:44:59,820 --> 02:45:07,420
on you know this question is pretty much setting us up to drop the clip again you

2136
02:45:07,420 --> 02:45:14,060
know that right illusion basically wanted to know what is Loki think of sex

2137
02:45:14,060 --> 02:45:40,980
What song was playing during Exquisite's FUs?

2138
02:45:40,980 --> 02:45:44,380
I think I recognized it, but I'm not sure because I hardly heard it.

2139
02:45:44,380 --> 02:45:50,060
The song that was playing during Explicit's FUs was EVO66 from 2DX Red.

2140
02:45:50,060 --> 02:45:54,060
That's the song we had.

2141
02:45:54,060 --> 02:46:00,060
This is the worst part, there we go, here we go.

2142
02:46:00,060 --> 02:46:06,380
That was the song that was playing, Wall 5, 2DX Red.

2143
02:46:06,380 --> 02:46:08,220
I thought it was an appropriate FU song.

2144
02:46:08,220 --> 02:46:12,620
I didn't even know there was a background where I was assigned to FUs.

2145
02:46:12,620 --> 02:46:15,460
All right, RainbowsInTheNight wants to know,

2146
02:46:15,460 --> 02:46:18,740
how can I fix my metal dance pad from Red Octane?

2147
02:46:18,740 --> 02:46:21,740
Half of the up arrow works, and the back arrow doesn't work at all.

2148
02:46:21,740 --> 02:46:24,900
Red Octane was all like, take it to a TV repairman.

2149
02:46:24,900 --> 02:46:26,460
Problem being, I'm broke.

2150
02:46:26,460 --> 02:46:27,400
Any suggestions?

2151
02:46:27,400 --> 02:46:28,980
I've already disassembled and cleaned it.

2152
02:46:28,980 --> 02:46:30,020
Same problems.

2153
02:46:30,020 --> 02:46:32,940
The closest ER machine is 40 minutes away on an interstate,

2154
02:46:32,940 --> 02:46:34,580
because Virginia's pretty lame.

2155
02:46:34,580 --> 02:46:35,660
Help would be nice.

2156
02:46:35,660 --> 02:46:37,700
Well, Loki, you built your own metal pads before.

2157
02:46:37,700 --> 02:46:42,200
What do you think TV repair man? What the hell? I'm not TV. That's kind of weird back to them

2158
02:46:42,200 --> 02:46:44,580
It's their own fucking pad. They should fix it. I don't know

2159
02:46:45,100 --> 02:46:50,740
Well now how did how did the sensors work in a metal pad at least you get a metal pad depends most likely

2160
02:46:50,740 --> 02:46:52,500
It's just going to be contacts in there

2161
02:46:52,500 --> 02:46:58,580
And if half the up arrow works or whatever probably half the contacts or something broke or something or fell off

2162
02:46:58,580 --> 02:47:04,360
I haven't really looked at their metal pads. I've taken apart crappy metal pads, and that's the way they work, but

2163
02:47:04,360 --> 02:47:09,720
it. I don't know. How long has he had it? Well, we don't know. I can ask how long he's

2164
02:47:09,720 --> 02:47:13,080
had it. I would ask, I mean, honestly, if you buy it from Red Octane, isn't there, like,

2165
02:47:13,080 --> 02:47:17,360
some sort of, like, return policy or something? Yeah, you gotta assume it's past return policy

2166
02:47:17,360 --> 02:47:21,520
time, though, if he's asking this. Oh, he says, out of warranty and yes, contacts. So,

2167
02:47:21,520 --> 02:47:27,360
he's saying, so, my first suggestion would be clean the contacts, and he says he's disassembled

2168
02:47:27,360 --> 02:47:31,360
and cleaned it. So, does that just mean one of his contacts is broken and he's shit out

2169
02:47:31,360 --> 02:47:35,360
It's not necessarily context, it'd be a loose wire or something also.

2170
02:47:35,360 --> 02:47:37,360
Mmm, that's a good thought too.

2171
02:47:37,360 --> 02:47:40,360
What, Jonas? Give him a mic.

2172
02:47:40,360 --> 02:47:43,360
Usually if you clean up the whole thing, it's usually not that case.

2173
02:47:43,360 --> 02:47:47,360
I've seen vendors actually try fixing this.

2174
02:47:47,360 --> 02:47:52,360
You have to check if one of the wires is burnt or anything like that.

2175
02:47:52,360 --> 02:47:56,360
So in what case is he absolutely screwed? How would this guy know if he's just screwed

2176
02:47:56,360 --> 02:47:58,360
and he shouldn't even bother wasting his time?

2177
02:47:58,360 --> 02:48:02,360
Because the shit could have just broke, and that's the sad thing.

2178
02:48:02,360 --> 02:48:07,360
I can't answer that question unless he tells you how long he has it, how many...

2179
02:48:07,360 --> 02:48:09,360
Yeah, it's just Christmas, he says.

2180
02:48:09,360 --> 02:48:12,360
And how many times have you been playing the game, like how many songs?

2181
02:48:12,360 --> 02:48:16,360
Well, you can assume if there's no DDR machine nearby, it's probably quite a bit.

2182
02:48:16,360 --> 02:48:20,360
Because, yeah, all I can say is that the paths don't last that long.

2183
02:48:20,360 --> 02:48:26,360
I guess the best answer we can come up with is that it sounds like you already kind of have an idea how to fix this thing

2184
02:48:26,360 --> 02:48:29,240
thing because you've opened it up and you've cleaned it so it's probably not a

2185
02:48:29,240 --> 02:48:33,120
whole lot else we could tell you except take a look at the wiring and make sure

2186
02:48:33,120 --> 02:48:37,160
you don't have any loose connections going from the contacts to the actual

2187
02:48:37,160 --> 02:48:42,200
like what do they call that where they all the it all comes together towards

2188
02:48:42,200 --> 02:48:47,160
the top whatever but check your wiring and but if a wire has shorted or burned

2189
02:48:47,160 --> 02:48:51,080
out is really not a whole lot short of replacing the wire that you're going to

2190
02:48:51,080 --> 02:48:54,360
be able to do which is something you probably don't want to try doing

2191
02:48:54,360 --> 02:48:55,360
yourself.

2192
02:48:55,360 --> 02:48:58,600
Yeah, you don't want to waste too much time on it, but usually it's just to get a new

2193
02:48:58,600 --> 02:49:02,480
pad because it's basically worn out. Wait, what games have you been playing, though?

2194
02:49:02,480 --> 02:49:04,120
Well, assuming it's DDR or some...

2195
02:49:04,120 --> 02:49:08,600
You mean, like, it's DDR and In the Groove as well, that use the same pads?

2196
02:49:08,600 --> 02:49:09,600
Well, but it wouldn't matter.

2197
02:49:09,600 --> 02:49:11,600
Yeah, I can understand if In the Groove ruined those pads.

2198
02:49:11,600 --> 02:49:12,600
Stop it.

2199
02:49:12,600 --> 02:49:14,600
It's such a horrible game. It's like, I can't take it.

2200
02:49:14,600 --> 02:49:19,040
Stop it. He says he plays every day about three to four hours a day on heavy mode, so

2201
02:49:19,040 --> 02:49:22,360
I think you've probably just beat that pad to death.

2202
02:49:22,360 --> 02:49:25,800
the sad thing is those red octane pads don't last forever

2203
02:49:25,800 --> 02:49:30,280
well I mean honestly if it's just like a metal pad or something

2204
02:49:30,280 --> 02:49:33,920
the contacts in it, I'm sure there's ways that you can mod them and upgrade them

2205
02:49:33,920 --> 02:49:35,640
just there's a whole thread on

2206
02:49:35,640 --> 02:49:39,880
DDR Freak about modding, fixing, doing stuff to your metal pads

2207
02:49:39,880 --> 02:49:43,580
just go there. Take a look there, ask a question there, see if they can help you

2208
02:49:43,580 --> 02:49:44,520
over on the Freak

2209
02:49:44,520 --> 02:49:48,760
otherwise make red octane give you a better answer because that's a shitty

2210
02:49:48,760 --> 02:49:50,960
answer they gave you so you should email them again

2211
02:49:50,960 --> 02:49:54,080
And tell them the people on the radio said that they gave you a shitty answer.

2212
02:49:54,080 --> 02:49:57,360
Get that person fired. I can't say that, really.

2213
02:49:57,360 --> 02:50:00,400
That's the best thing that we can give you guys. Sorry.

2214
02:50:00,400 --> 02:50:04,400
Alright. Acer800 wants to know

2215
02:50:04,400 --> 02:50:09,600
who would win in an actual cage match? Loki, Dark Sakura, or me, Sky?

2216
02:50:09,600 --> 02:50:14,280
Good question. Dark Sakura, who would win in an actual cage match between the three of us?

2217
02:50:14,280 --> 02:50:18,320
I would. Why? Because I exercise regularly, lift weights,

2218
02:50:18,320 --> 02:50:21,960
And I've taken karate.

2219
02:50:21,960 --> 02:50:28,160
I've got that killing urge. Yeah, but that's when you need to be sloppy and make mistakes.

2220
02:50:28,160 --> 02:50:32,160
I've got a lot of smarts up here. I could... I'd make you two...

2221
02:50:32,160 --> 02:50:36,680
See, I would make Loki and Dark Sakura beat up on each other while I just kinda watch.

2222
02:50:36,680 --> 02:50:40,520
No. And then that way I save my strength. I'd use you as a bludgeoning tool.

2223
02:50:40,520 --> 02:50:43,520
Yeah, we'll see about that one.

2224
02:50:43,520 --> 02:50:47,960
Honestly, Ace800? That was kinda fun. We would not know the answer to that one

2225
02:50:47,960 --> 02:50:58,960
unless we actually tried it, which maybe we'll do one of these days, as a ratings stunt.

2226
02:50:58,960 --> 02:51:07,800
Reznor wants to know, what's the status on the old school show?

2227
02:51:07,800 --> 02:51:10,520
The old school show was supposed to launch a couple weeks ago, and I'm really sorry it

2228
02:51:10,520 --> 02:51:11,520
hasn't happened yet.

2229
02:51:11,520 --> 02:51:16,440
A decision was made on the staff that we want to make it not just 8-bit music, but 16-bit

2230
02:51:16,440 --> 02:51:20,500
16-bit music as well, and I've just been so freaking busy that I haven't had the time

2231
02:51:20,500 --> 02:51:26,780
to update the 16-bit music as well, so I'm going to try and get on that this week, because,

2232
02:51:26,780 --> 02:51:32,340
yeah, so I will, I'll keep you posted on that. I definitely want it to happen before summer's

2233
02:51:32,340 --> 02:51:36,700
over, hopefully before August gets here, so I will work just for you on the 16-bit stuff

2234
02:51:36,700 --> 02:51:43,360
this week, okay? Promise. Alright, moving on.

2235
02:51:43,360 --> 02:51:47,360
sakarina wants to know can you make an mp3 of that ask orange lounge song

2236
02:51:47,360 --> 02:51:52,560
actually it's a song called journey to the wonderland by and pb and it's in

2237
02:51:52,560 --> 02:51:53,920
keyboard mania too

2238
02:51:53,920 --> 02:51:58,680
if you want a clip of me actually singing it

2239
02:51:58,680 --> 02:52:01,120
uh... asap every week is different

2240
02:52:01,120 --> 02:52:04,480
and uh... bumblebee disguise we fix

2241
02:52:04,480 --> 02:52:06,360
oh my god that's all

2242
02:52:06,360 --> 02:52:09,160
i think i played it like a couple weeks ago

2243
02:52:09,160 --> 02:52:10,240
very very old

2244
02:52:10,240 --> 02:52:12,800
You actually played it on your show?

2245
02:52:12,800 --> 02:52:18,200
Several times. Bitch.

2246
02:52:18,200 --> 02:52:21,680
And Sakarina also wants to know if we could play the actual Silent Hill because I

2247
02:52:21,680 --> 02:52:24,800
fucked up last break. He wanted to hear the actual song Silent Hill

2248
02:52:24,800 --> 02:52:27,960
and not the um... a song from Silent Hill.

2249
02:52:27,960 --> 02:52:28,840
So my bad.

2250
02:52:28,840 --> 02:52:35,840
Uh... here's... we're running out of time on the show so here's a clip.

2251
02:52:35,840 --> 02:52:45,580
All right, that's all you get. Sorry. We're already short on time.

2252
02:52:45,580 --> 02:52:49,780
Tomokun wanted to make a point just to follow up. Yes, ParaParadancer did have sensors on

2253
02:52:49,780 --> 02:52:57,660
the back as well. Well, that's why ParaParadise didn't have the 180MO, because they didn't

2254
02:52:57,660 --> 02:53:05,260
have sensors on the back. Probably a cost-cutting thing, honestly. That's my best answer.

2255
02:53:05,260 --> 02:53:10,660
Neodude wants to know, what do you guys think about the Konami Red Octane Rock Sword Mad

2256
02:53:10,660 --> 02:53:11,660
Cats lawsuit?

2257
02:53:11,660 --> 02:53:13,900
Didn't we talk about that a few weeks ago?

2258
02:53:13,900 --> 02:53:16,420
We kind of did talk about it a few weeks ago on the show.

2259
02:53:16,420 --> 02:53:19,220
I'm going to assume that we've got a new listener on our hands, which is cool.

2260
02:53:19,220 --> 02:53:20,540
Hi, welcome to the show.

2261
02:53:20,540 --> 02:53:22,800
Hope you enjoy.

2262
02:53:22,800 --> 02:53:28,220
But there have been a few recent developments, and the chat can sometimes sway your mind.

2263
02:53:28,220 --> 02:53:29,220
What do you think?

2264
02:53:29,220 --> 02:53:30,780
Loki, what's your latest perspective on this?

2265
02:53:30,780 --> 02:53:32,820
Although I already know what you're going to say.

2266
02:53:32,820 --> 02:53:36,600
latest perspective on this is you know Konami's within their rights you know

2267
02:53:36,600 --> 02:53:40,380
through this because you know these companies are making you know crappy

2268
02:53:40,380 --> 02:53:44,800
games and well not necessarily crappy games they're they're making games

2269
02:53:44,800 --> 02:53:50,160
obviously are too much like DDR I mean they're just trying to like kind of get

2270
02:53:50,160 --> 02:53:54,840
people like oh hey you like DDR then you'll like this almost like DDR game

2271
02:53:54,840 --> 02:54:00,780
and you know when it comes down to it it's just an inferior product just like

2272
02:54:00,780 --> 02:54:07,240
those Apple products and um... Hey! You know that they were having a huge debate in the

2273
02:54:07,240 --> 02:54:11,560
chat room before this started and it simmered down and I was hoping they would shut up already

2274
02:54:11,560 --> 02:54:16,580
about the Apple versus PC thing, but no, you had to go in over your big fat mouth and bring

2275
02:54:16,580 --> 02:54:20,100
up the Apple thing again. This is because you don't know how to use it. Exactly. Oh

2276
02:54:20,100 --> 02:54:24,820
that's right. On! Where's your on button? How do I upgrade this thing? Oh that's right,

2277
02:54:24,820 --> 02:54:29,300
it's all built together. Stop it. They, oh, somebody wanted... I've upgraded Macs before.

2278
02:54:29,300 --> 02:54:33,540
wanted me to point out that there is, now I don't have the exact thing, but I'm sure

2279
02:54:33,540 --> 02:54:38,900
somebody will say this, but there is a way you can customize Macs more than you think.

2280
02:54:38,900 --> 02:54:40,900
They were saying this store somewhere.

2281
02:54:40,900 --> 02:54:41,900
No.

2282
02:54:41,900 --> 02:54:49,940
I have opened up Macs before and changed out their memory, changed out the hard drives,

2283
02:54:49,940 --> 02:54:51,700
put in new graphics cards.

2284
02:54:51,700 --> 02:54:55,160
Yeah, you can upgrade a Mac the same way you can a PC.

2285
02:54:55,160 --> 02:54:57,540
No matter what you do, they're still in for you.

2286
02:54:57,540 --> 02:54:59,540
and you're talking out of your ass.

2287
02:54:59,540 --> 02:55:01,540
Can't we just all get along?

2288
02:55:01,540 --> 02:55:02,540
Isn't there room for-

2289
02:55:02,540 --> 02:55:04,540
As soon as he stops talking out of his ass

2290
02:55:04,540 --> 02:55:06,540
and actually talks about something he knows about, maybe.

2291
02:55:06,540 --> 02:55:11,540
Wait, now that we're not on the contrary with Konami, Rockstar, and Red Octane Maggots,

2292
02:55:11,540 --> 02:55:14,540
what would happen with this Neon FM game since-

2293
02:55:15,540 --> 02:55:17,540
It's nothing like DDR, that's why.

2294
02:55:18,540 --> 02:55:19,540
I'll tell you what's-

2295
02:55:19,540 --> 02:55:23,540
That's the only thing I'm thinking about since, you know, like the Konami thing.

2296
02:55:23,540 --> 02:55:28,220
Here's my perspective with it, as long as Neon FM doesn't try to invade the home markets,

2297
02:55:28,220 --> 02:55:29,220
they'll be fine.

2298
02:55:29,220 --> 02:55:31,060
No, I think they're going to be fine anyways because they've been working with actually

2299
02:55:31,060 --> 02:55:34,820
Konami on this, they've actually flown the people in or whatever and have them look at

2300
02:55:34,820 --> 02:55:35,820
the game.

2301
02:55:35,820 --> 02:55:39,080
Hopefully though, hopefully though, they're not just feeding us BS with that.

2302
02:55:39,080 --> 02:55:43,740
Because the In the Groove team said, the In the Groove team said, shut up, we know it's

2303
02:55:43,740 --> 02:55:45,660
legal and now here you go.

2304
02:55:45,660 --> 02:55:50,340
But honestly, looking at the gameplay of this game, it is quite different from, I mean,

2305
02:55:50,340 --> 02:55:56,040
The setup of the pads are different, the gameplay looks different, it's got just really different

2306
02:55:56,040 --> 02:55:57,040
stuff in it.

2307
02:55:57,040 --> 02:56:01,560
So, I don't think that they're going to be really fringing out, whereas, you know, In

2308
02:56:01,560 --> 02:56:05,420
the Groove looks like DDR just with different, you know, shaped arrows.

2309
02:56:05,420 --> 02:56:07,580
I mean, it's pretty much the same damn game.

2310
02:56:07,580 --> 02:56:11,340
And honestly, the Mad Catz game was just a shitty game in general and brought everybody

2311
02:56:11,340 --> 02:56:12,340
down.

2312
02:56:12,340 --> 02:56:13,820
So it just needed a spanking, basically.

2313
02:56:13,820 --> 02:56:18,620
That's the only question I have with, like, what would happen to Neon FM, because everyone's

2314
02:56:18,620 --> 02:56:24,140
saying who is beat mania on feet in but then again I think as long as they

2315
02:56:24,140 --> 02:56:30,300
aren't I think as long as it's different enough from DDR with the foot layout and

2316
02:56:30,300 --> 02:56:33,620
everything in there in-game layout appears to be very different I think

2317
02:56:33,620 --> 02:56:36,940
they'll be okay just like pump it up so okay well but of course you have that

2318
02:56:36,940 --> 02:56:41,340
whole new lawsuit thing but whatever anyway long story short what I believe

2319
02:56:41,340 --> 02:56:44,700
what's going on in this lawsuit in the groove should have never tried to come

2320
02:56:44,700 --> 02:56:47,660
out for the home systems because it awoke the Konami sleeping giant and

2321
02:56:47,660 --> 02:56:51,980
that's what's happening now so that's my thought I really have no comment on that

2322
02:56:51,980 --> 02:56:56,180
that's just something that everyone has no has a personal preference on that so

2323
02:56:56,180 --> 02:57:02,020
all right anyway moving on Ron Chen has one what anime slash a video game

2324
02:57:02,020 --> 02:57:07,340
character would you all cosplay and why dark soccer you actually do cosplay so I

2325
02:57:07,340 --> 02:57:09,500
should start with you I've never actually cosplay a character from

2326
02:57:09,500 --> 02:57:13,780
I've cosplayed a character from a manga.

2327
02:57:13,780 --> 02:57:18,620
I went as Mad Hatter from Sanctuary.

2328
02:57:18,620 --> 02:57:23,220
I've also cosplayed Biken from Guilty Gear X.

2329
02:57:23,220 --> 02:57:29,000
Dan didn't like that because I didn't have anything to hold my boobs up.

2330
02:57:29,000 --> 02:57:33,260
I've cosplayed Jill from Resident Evil.

2331
02:57:33,260 --> 02:57:36,460
I actually still have that costume. I've cosplayed Emmie

2332
02:57:36,460 --> 02:57:39,260
as in 3rd Mix DDR

2333
02:57:39,260 --> 02:57:43,700
uh... who else have I done? Oh yeah, Shorty from Busty Move 2

2334
02:57:43,700 --> 02:57:45,740
uh...

2335
02:57:45,740 --> 02:57:49,040
I really don't know and I've been trying to think of who I would...

2336
02:57:49,040 --> 02:57:50,580
Leona from...

2337
02:57:50,580 --> 02:57:52,540
I've done Leona

2338
02:57:52,540 --> 02:57:56,540
The costume is actually three sizes too big for me now

2339
02:57:56,540 --> 02:57:59,100
I'll take that back, four sizes too big for me now

2340
02:57:59,100 --> 02:58:01,260
so it's officially retired

2341
02:58:01,260 --> 02:58:02,340
uh...

2342
02:58:02,340 --> 02:58:11,320
I was working on doing, uh, uh, Richter Belmont from, uh, Dracula X, but I really, I want

2343
02:58:11,320 --> 02:58:15,600
to do one from an anime, I just don't know who, although it's been suggested to do Hyatt

2344
02:58:15,600 --> 02:58:21,480
from, uh, Exosaga, but I don't want to do that outfit, and I don't want to carry around

2345
02:58:21,480 --> 02:58:23,140
fake blood and cough.

2346
02:58:23,140 --> 02:58:27,720
I witnessed Ash Ketchum one year for Halloween, does that count?

2347
02:58:27,720 --> 02:58:28,720
I hate that name.

2348
02:58:28,720 --> 02:58:29,720
I love Pokemon.

2349
02:58:29,720 --> 02:58:31,960
You're watching The American Craft!

2350
02:58:31,960 --> 02:58:36,960
I am watching the American Graph. I've seen a shitload of Pokemon trainers up in Animexpo.

2351
02:58:36,960 --> 02:58:40,960
Alright, somebody started to ride on the Orange Orange forums, what should I cosplay?

2352
02:58:40,960 --> 02:58:45,960
Loki, what would you cosplay as? Gendo the Uberpimp.

2353
02:58:45,960 --> 02:58:49,960
Alright. Let's see, I'll probably cosplay as Blanka for next year.

2354
02:58:49,960 --> 02:58:52,960
I am not cosplaying as Noodle, thank you.

2355
02:58:52,960 --> 02:58:59,960
I don't know, that would be fun. Oh yeah, we get some body paint and do something for the Masquerade for Animexpo.

2356
02:58:59,960 --> 02:59:04,360
We have another really good question from the chatroom.

2357
02:59:04,360 --> 02:59:08,640
Maluja wants to know, what does Loki think about do-it-yourself abortion kits?

2358
02:59:08,640 --> 02:59:09,640
It's so much fun.

2359
02:59:09,640 --> 02:59:10,640
It's great.

2360
02:59:10,640 --> 02:59:15,160
That'll never get old, Loki.

2361
02:59:15,160 --> 02:59:19,520
Yeah, but you gotta clip it out.

2362
02:59:19,520 --> 02:59:26,320
And TomoKun would like to point out, Loki, a Power Mac, it's like a PC, they are 100%

2363
02:59:26,320 --> 02:59:27,320
upgradeable.

2364
02:59:27,320 --> 02:59:28,880
From shit to crap.

2365
02:59:28,880 --> 02:59:36,880
Stop it! You are... You know what? For your birthday, I'm buying you a gift certificate to the Apple store, and you will set it on fire.

2366
02:59:36,880 --> 02:59:39,880
You could just suffer. You will have to find something you like.

2367
02:59:39,880 --> 02:59:46,880
I will buy... If you give me enough money to buy an iPod, I will buy an iPod and I will take a sledgehammer to it.

2368
02:59:46,880 --> 02:59:47,880
And then I will sell it.

2369
02:59:47,880 --> 02:59:49,880
You're just a bastard.

2370
02:59:49,880 --> 02:59:53,880
I love my iPod. It's like the best thing ever.

2371
02:59:53,880 --> 02:59:58,380
They said I am a little upset because my roommate just bought an iPod and he paid the same price

2372
02:59:58,380 --> 03:00:02,340
for his that I paid for mine, but because he bought his six months later, he got a color

2373
03:00:02,340 --> 03:00:03,340
one.

2374
03:00:03,340 --> 03:00:04,340
Bastard.

2375
03:00:04,340 --> 03:00:05,340
Alright.

2376
03:00:05,340 --> 03:00:08,260
Anyway, that's going to do it for Ask Orange Lounge.

2377
03:00:08,260 --> 03:00:11,280
Thank you guys for submitting your questions.

2378
03:00:11,280 --> 03:00:15,500
And now, it's 9.30, it's time to end the show.

2379
03:00:15,500 --> 03:00:16,780
Final thought time.

2380
03:00:16,780 --> 03:00:18,780
Explicit, your final thought.

2381
03:00:18,780 --> 03:00:24,540
oh it's nice to meet you guys again just take the good old times I'm glad you

2382
03:00:24,540 --> 03:00:28,980
found the new house okay yeah that too and I'm and I finally got a chance to

2383
03:00:28,980 --> 03:00:32,260
come over here to introduce the tournament finally since I was been so

2384
03:00:32,260 --> 03:00:39,460
busy yeah there's a tournament that's in July 30th this Saturday DDRPA and

2385
03:00:39,460 --> 03:00:44,060
freestyle and it's possible that newspaper journalists will come in for

2386
03:00:44,060 --> 03:00:48,060
like Sacramento Bee. And don't forget, there's Lumpia and Ice Cream.

2387
03:00:48,060 --> 03:00:50,060
And you might get your foot in the paper.

2388
03:00:50,060 --> 03:00:51,060
Hmm, Lumpia.

2389
03:00:51,060 --> 03:00:52,060
Hmm, Lumpia, I agree.

2390
03:00:52,060 --> 03:00:53,060
Say again, what about my foot?

2391
03:00:53,060 --> 03:00:55,060
You might get your foot in the paper, just like Loki did.

2392
03:00:55,060 --> 03:00:59,060
If Sac Bee comes out, because you know Loki's foot was in the Sac Bee, playing DDR.

2393
03:00:59,060 --> 03:01:00,060
Oh, wow.

2394
03:01:00,060 --> 03:01:04,060
Have fun at the tournament. That'll be at Paradise Island in Sacramento, California.

2395
03:01:04,060 --> 03:01:05,060
Yes.

2396
03:01:05,060 --> 03:01:06,060
All right, have fun.

2397
03:01:06,060 --> 03:01:09,060
In addition to a Super Smash Brothers meal, for those who are interested in that.

2398
03:01:09,060 --> 03:01:13,060
I'll just do, you know my strategy at Super Smash Brothers is to just play as Ness.

2399
03:01:13,060 --> 03:01:16,060
PK Fire! PK Fire! PK Fire!

2400
03:01:16,060 --> 03:01:19,060
Lowkey! Your final thought.

2401
03:01:19,060 --> 03:01:22,060
I just unlocked the third picture in Peek-a-boo-pooger.

2402
03:01:22,060 --> 03:01:25,060
In which dialogue set? No, wait, no.

2403
03:01:25,060 --> 03:01:30,060
Hey, what are you guys doing out there while you're watching my moves?

2404
03:01:30,060 --> 03:01:32,060
What the hell does that mean? That's retarded.

2405
03:01:32,060 --> 03:01:34,060
I don't think that's what the fanboys are watching.

2406
03:01:34,060 --> 03:01:36,060
See? Oh yeah.

2407
03:01:36,060 --> 03:01:42,060
My final thought is I'm craving dinner because I haven't eaten, like, a real meal yet today

2408
03:01:42,060 --> 03:01:45,060
and you guys ate all those chicken nuggets and didn't save me one.

2409
03:01:45,060 --> 03:01:48,060
And I ate the two barbecue sauce packets. Ew.

2410
03:01:48,060 --> 03:01:51,060
I bought cheese and cherries.

2411
03:01:51,060 --> 03:01:57,060
Loki, I hope you go home and find all your computers that were replaced with Macs.

2412
03:01:57,060 --> 03:01:59,060
DarkSakura, your final thought?

2413
03:01:59,060 --> 03:02:01,060
Reject sauce icons.

2414
03:02:01,060 --> 03:02:05,060
Did somebody buy me that 2D shirt at Hot Topic?

2415
03:02:05,060 --> 03:02:07,060
The final word of the show, one word to sum it all up.

2416
03:02:07,060 --> 03:02:10,060
Since we actually have a special guest tonight, I'll give it to him.

2417
03:02:10,060 --> 03:02:15,300
Oh, next week on Orange Honors Radio, are we taking a vacation for two weeks?

2418
03:02:15,300 --> 03:02:16,300
Or what are we doing?

2419
03:02:16,300 --> 03:02:17,300
Maybe.

2420
03:02:17,300 --> 03:02:18,300
We might do something.

2421
03:02:18,300 --> 03:02:19,300
Stay tuned to the website.

2422
03:02:19,300 --> 03:02:21,700
Our podcast will still be coming to you no matter what.

2423
03:02:21,700 --> 03:02:24,060
You may have Dark Sakura chat.

2424
03:02:24,060 --> 03:02:25,060
We don't know.

2425
03:02:25,060 --> 03:02:28,380
Something will happen on the station the next couple of weeks, whether it be reruns.

2426
03:02:28,380 --> 03:02:31,260
It won't be our normal three-hour show, but something.

2427
03:02:31,260 --> 03:02:34,220
Or maybe it will be the three-hour show, just sounds sky.

2428
03:02:34,220 --> 03:02:35,220
We'll see.

2429
03:02:35,220 --> 03:02:36,220
Maybe.

2430
03:02:36,220 --> 03:02:38,700
We have to hash that out this week in big board meetings.

2431
03:02:38,700 --> 03:02:39,700
So we'll see.

2432
03:02:39,700 --> 03:02:43,580
We'll see. Alright, that's going to do it.

2433
03:02:43,580 --> 03:02:46,700
Final word of the show, Jonas.

2434
03:02:46,700 --> 03:02:48,700
Mitchie!

2435
03:02:48,700 --> 03:02:54,700

And now, here is your fortune cookie message of the day.

2439
03:03:12,700 --> 03:03:15,700
Crumbs chief, what do we do now?

2440
03:03:15,700 --> 03:03:17,700
I'm taking the direct approach.

2441
03:03:17,700 --> 03:03:20,700
Direct approach? Who knew?

2442
03:03:20,700 --> 03:03:22,700
Who knew? Not that!

2443
03:03:22,700 --> 03:03:26,700
Anything but that, please! Please!

2444
03:03:26,700 --> 03:03:31,700
Oh, Eck! Oh, middle! Oh, crumbs!

2445
03:03:31,700 --> 03:03:32,700
Penfold.

2446
03:03:32,700 --> 03:03:37,700
Please, Tim! You can't! You mustn't!

2447
03:03:37,700 --> 03:03:38,700
Penfold.

2448
03:03:38,700 --> 03:03:40,700
Yes, sheep!

2449
03:03:40,700 --> 03:03:41,700
Shush!

2450
03:03:41,700 --> 03:03:45,700
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.

2451
03:04:11,700 --> 03:04:19,460
All right, guys, we're going to disconnect the station now.

2452
03:04:19,460 --> 03:04:26,220
You can reconnect to Orange Lounge Radio in about, what is it, about 15 seconds to resume

2453
03:04:26,220 --> 03:04:30,580
hearing all your favorite DDR, 2DX, and other video game favorites.

2454
03:04:30,580 --> 03:04:34,060
Loki, what do you think about your new channel, Loki Sucks?

2455
03:04:34,060 --> 03:04:35,540
It's so much fun.

2456
03:04:35,540 --> 03:04:39,380
Good night, guys.

2457
03:04:39,380 --> 03:04:40,220
Have a good one.
