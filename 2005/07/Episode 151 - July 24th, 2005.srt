[SPEAKER_06]: This is brand new, by the way.

10
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:29,836
[SPEAKER_06]: I have not even looked at this.

11
00:02:29,856 --> 00:02:35,421
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I saw it when it was on TV, but I have not looked at the digitized format of it, so we're going to check that out very soon.

21
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:11,743
[SPEAKER_06]: Orange Lounge Radio will not contain any of that in this episode.

[SPEAKER_06]: We're plugged in and fully interactive through our website at www.orangeloungeradio.com My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.

30

[SPEAKER_06]: Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts.

31
00:05:16,094 --> 00:05:22,038
[SPEAKER_06]: In this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm, Miss Jamie Summers, also known as DarkSakura.

32
00:05:25,641 --> 00:05:26,602
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, she's not here.

33
00:05:26,702 --> 00:05:28,783
[SPEAKER_06]: She's running a little late tonight.

34
00:05:28,824 --> 00:05:30,805
[SPEAKER_06]: She had some family business she had to take care of.

35
00:05:31,229 --> 00:05:35,351
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully everything's okay, but she's going to be here a little bit later on, just so you know.

36
00:05:36,112 --> 00:05:38,974
[SPEAKER_06]: However, we do have the one and only Loki.

37
00:05:39,754 --> 00:05:40,254
[SPEAKER_06]: I am here.

38
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:42,916
[SPEAKER_06]: And not in the cushion of the seat.

39
00:05:43,016 --> 00:05:45,938
[SPEAKER_06]: That was very good timing, by the way, finding your microphone.

40
00:05:46,078 --> 00:05:49,060
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Jamie should be sitting on both of the microphones then.

41
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:50,741
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure.

42
00:05:51,001 --> 00:05:52,962
[SPEAKER_06]: It probably got put there during the party last night.

43
00:05:52,982 --> 00:05:54,623
[SPEAKER_06]: We had a little bit of a house party last night.

44
00:05:54,963 --> 00:05:57,264
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe I shouldn't be talking with this microphone against my mouth.

45
00:05:58,885 --> 00:05:59,986
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that the loud, sensitive one?

46
00:06:01,908 --> 00:06:02,548
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, who knows?

47
00:06:02,688 --> 00:06:02,888
[SPEAKER_06]: No?

48
00:06:03,089 --> 00:06:03,329
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

49
00:06:03,909 --> 00:06:07,752
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so Loki's here, and then special guest-wise, we have nobody.

50
00:06:08,553 --> 00:06:10,034
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, what the hell happened?

51
00:06:10,074 --> 00:06:12,416
[SPEAKER_06]: We used to have special guests here every single week.

52
00:06:12,456 --> 00:06:15,579
[SPEAKER_06]: There'd be somebody here, and lately, nobody loves us anymore.

53
00:06:15,619 --> 00:06:16,980
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it because we're in this new place?

54
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,001
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't get it.

55
00:06:19,102 --> 00:06:19,782
[SPEAKER_06]: Something's weird.

56
00:06:19,882 --> 00:06:21,243
[SPEAKER_06]: Can they give him bad directions?

57
00:06:21,624 --> 00:06:22,204
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess so.

58
00:06:22,304 --> 00:06:24,766
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like I lied to him about where I live or something.

59
00:06:24,826 --> 00:06:25,207
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

60
00:06:26,468 --> 00:06:26,808
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh well.

61
00:06:27,455 --> 00:06:28,475
[SPEAKER_06]: Fine, see if we care.

62
00:06:28,515 --> 00:06:30,276
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll just sit here and do the show ourselves.

63
00:06:30,596 --> 00:06:32,337
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have some fun stuff to talk about tonight.

64
00:06:33,377 --> 00:06:35,518
[SPEAKER_06]: We were famous this week.

65
00:06:36,058 --> 00:06:37,378
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know, we're always famous.

66
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:42,660
[SPEAKER_06]: But no, we were on local news this week, so we have to show that clip later in the show.

67
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,601
[SPEAKER_06]: Which makes for great radio, by the way, showing video clips.

68
00:06:45,961 --> 00:06:47,862
[SPEAKER_06]: But even the audio of it is going to be pretty funny.

69
00:06:48,822 --> 00:06:50,843
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki's bit in it is priceless.

70
00:06:51,503 --> 00:06:51,823
[SPEAKER_06]: Love it.

71
00:06:52,608 --> 00:06:58,169
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll be airing that for you guys, and telling you guys how you can get a copy of the video, because some of you guys are asking about that.

72
00:06:58,189 --> 00:07:01,910
[SPEAKER_06]: Just like Publish Media, too, you'll get the best of me.

73
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:05,330
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, last time when we were in the paper, it was your foot.

74
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:08,531
[SPEAKER_06]: More of my foot in this one, too.

75
00:07:08,951 --> 00:07:10,691
[SPEAKER_05]: They actually, well, we'll get to that later.

76
00:07:10,711 --> 00:07:11,771
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we'll get to that a little later.

77
00:07:12,531 --> 00:07:14,492
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, we gotta talk about our buddy MidiHead.

78
00:07:14,872 --> 00:07:16,952
[SPEAKER_06]: He's been doing some fun stuff this week.

79
00:07:18,072 --> 00:07:20,653
[SPEAKER_06]: And we'll play a little clip of his new Ultramix 3 song, too.

80
00:07:20,913 --> 00:07:22,013
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to play the whole thing...

81
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:23,281
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

82
00:08:07,524 --> 00:08:08,552
Thank you for watching!

83
00:09:17,529 --> 00:09:19,330
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Night, you make me cry, I need your love

84
00:09:50,188 --> 00:09:54,472
Listen to the song, the melody will set you free.

85
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:56,413
[SPEAKER_17]: You need my love, it's in your mind.

86
00:09:56,493 --> 00:09:58,715
[SPEAKER_17]: I need you, I love you, I can't sleep with you.

87
00:09:58,835 --> 00:10:00,517
[SPEAKER_17]: You gotta save your life.

88
00:10:00,537 --> 00:10:01,758
The night makes me cry.

89
00:10:01,818 --> 00:10:03,519
I need your love, it's in my mind.

90
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:06,401
I need you, I love you, I can't sleep with you.

91
00:10:06,461 --> 00:10:07,222
Listen to the song.

92
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,521
Thank you for watching.

93
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:18,622
Please subscribe to my channel.

94
00:11:20,381 --> 00:11:21,249
Thanks for watching!

95
00:13:28,032 --> 00:13:32,815
[SPEAKER_17]: From Step Squad to Orange Lounge, this PDR sucks!

96
00:13:33,215 --> 00:13:44,522
[SPEAKER_17]: Holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

97
00:13:44,762 --> 00:13:47,323
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I threw up in my mouth a little bit during that last break.

98
00:13:49,024 --> 00:13:49,265
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

99
00:13:49,985 --> 00:13:52,106
[SPEAKER_06]: We had some vomit-inducing songs.

100
00:13:52,486 --> 00:13:55,568
[SPEAKER_06]: Admit it, there's at least one song you hated in that last break.

101
00:13:56,389 --> 00:13:56,669
[SPEAKER_06]: I think

102
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:01,402
[SPEAKER_06]: I think during that break we'd have people in the chatroom be like, Oh, I love that song!

103
00:14:01,422 --> 00:14:03,463
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there'd be other people going, God, I hate that song.

104
00:14:03,483 --> 00:14:05,565
[SPEAKER_06]: And then during the next song, it would switch around.

105
00:14:06,365 --> 00:14:08,447
[SPEAKER_06]: Cartoon Heroes by Barbie Young.

106
00:14:09,447 --> 00:14:11,188
[SPEAKER_06]: Speed Over Beethoven by Rose.

107
00:14:11,429 --> 00:14:15,431
[SPEAKER_06]: Nori Nori Nori, Judy Crystal, and Living in America from DDR Max 2.

108
00:14:15,972 --> 00:14:18,253
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't remember the artist on that because I'm too lazy to look it up.

109
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:20,595
[SPEAKER_06]: And I never play that song, so I don't remember.

110
00:14:21,996 --> 00:14:22,216
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh well.

111
00:14:23,396 --> 00:14:23,657
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

112
00:14:24,998 --> 00:14:26,338
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're here with another show.

113
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:26,959
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, hello!

114
00:14:28,186 --> 00:14:29,327
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the lovely DarkSakura.

115
00:14:29,367 --> 00:14:29,807
[SPEAKER_06]: She's here.

116
00:14:31,027 --> 00:14:35,990
[SPEAKER_06]: And we were about ready to chat about what's going on in the Bomani world.

117
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:39,872
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, before that, though, we always have to start off each week's show with a little bit of, How was your week?

118
00:14:40,352 --> 00:14:41,072
[SPEAKER_06]: How was your day?

119
00:14:41,693 --> 00:14:43,213
[SPEAKER_06]: And DarkSakura just joined us.

120
00:14:43,353 --> 00:14:48,116
[SPEAKER_14]: She usually starts us off, so... I'd rather not talk about my week, thanks.

121
00:14:48,976 --> 00:14:49,236
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

122
00:14:49,596 --> 00:14:50,997
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, then we'll move on to Loki.

123
00:14:51,818 --> 00:14:53,118
[SPEAKER_05]: My week was hot.

124
00:14:54,599 --> 00:14:55,019
[SPEAKER_06]: That's hot.

125
00:14:55,719 --> 00:14:56,620
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's because...

126
00:14:57,575 --> 00:14:59,956
[SPEAKER_05]: The air conditioning is broken for a week, so that sucked.

127
00:14:59,996 --> 00:15:03,838
[SPEAKER_05]: But I have a house with a dog, my mom's dog, and that sucked also.

128
00:15:04,859 --> 00:15:07,440
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um, what else?

129
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,161
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, just a lot of sucking.

130
00:15:09,622 --> 00:15:15,625
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, you know, staying at my mom's house sucked because she is on dial-up and no one likes dial-up.

131
00:15:15,745 --> 00:15:23,809
[SPEAKER_05]: And also the fact that the dog, you know, wants constant attention all the time, including at 3 in the morning, and it's just, you know, very tiring.

132
00:15:23,949 --> 00:15:25,190
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I finally get home...

133
00:15:25,523 --> 00:15:27,464
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, on Friday, you know, okay, I'm done.

134
00:15:27,524 --> 00:15:32,326
[SPEAKER_05]: Finally, you know, the apartment complex has had a week to fix their, you know, AC.

135
00:15:32,466 --> 00:15:34,047
[SPEAKER_05]: Nope, nope, nope, they're not done yet.

136
00:15:34,647 --> 00:15:36,068
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not going to be done until Monday.

137
00:15:36,788 --> 00:15:39,690
[SPEAKER_05]: So, all weekend, it's been like 95 degrees in the apartment.

138
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,811
[SPEAKER_05]: What are they having to do for your AC?

139
00:15:41,891 --> 00:15:48,774
[SPEAKER_05]: They replaced the whole thing, the whole entire unit, and then they said they clogged something, so they've got to do something on... Jesus.

140
00:15:48,954 --> 00:15:50,935
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm like, oh, God, you're fucking retarded.

141
00:15:50,975 --> 00:15:51,575
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

142
00:15:51,856 --> 00:15:54,817
[SPEAKER_06]: Your situation is starting to sound like the plot of Dark Water.

143
00:15:57,168 --> 00:15:58,449
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's about more than a mold spot.

144
00:15:58,469 --> 00:16:02,470
[SPEAKER_06]: It is, but that's where they try to get the scares wrong.

145
00:16:26,465 --> 00:16:34,851
[SPEAKER_05]: with mold, you know, cause that killer mold, the black mold, it's always gotta be the black mold, you know, what do they got against the black mold?

146
00:16:38,133 --> 00:16:56,245
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, basically, um, it sucked a lot, and then, um, I don't know, then the rest of the week was just basically, um, you know, work stuff, playing PSP, played more Killer7, and that type of thing.

147
00:16:57,864 --> 00:16:58,024
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

148
00:16:59,245 --> 00:16:59,585
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

149
00:17:01,426 --> 00:17:03,548
[SPEAKER_06]: My week and my day was okay.

150
00:17:03,928 --> 00:17:05,149
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing to scream about, really.

151
00:17:05,529 --> 00:17:09,832
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been very hot here in the city, so it makes you not want to go out and do a lot.

152
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:15,276
[SPEAKER_06]: I went and saw Charlie and the Chocolate Factory for the second time.

153
00:17:15,316 --> 00:17:15,977
[SPEAKER_06]: That was pretty cool.

154
00:17:16,877 --> 00:17:17,717
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that movie rocks.

155
00:17:18,338 --> 00:17:21,099
[SPEAKER_06]: And I went to this restaurant called the Cheesecake Factory.

156
00:17:21,659 --> 00:17:23,020
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is for my roommate's birthday.

157
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:26,741
[SPEAKER_06]: And this place is very, very expensive.

158
00:17:26,781 --> 00:17:29,643
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's kind of known around town for having a very, very long wait.

159
00:17:30,123 --> 00:17:32,904
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't remember if this place is a national chain or if it's something on the west coast.

160
00:17:32,924 --> 00:17:33,524
[SPEAKER_06]: I know they have more.

161
00:17:33,544 --> 00:17:34,705
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it national?

162
00:17:34,745 --> 00:17:37,346
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, then they've got one of these probably near you somewhere.

163
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:38,387
[SPEAKER_06]: I've never been before.

164
00:17:38,427 --> 00:17:40,047
[SPEAKER_06]: It's brand new in this part of town.

165
00:17:40,067 --> 00:17:41,208
[SPEAKER_06]: They have crappy pizza there.

166
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:45,209
[SPEAKER_06]: I've never had the pizza, but the food in general... You had good orange chicken.

167
00:17:45,990 --> 00:18:02,460
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually had the orange chicken, and to be honest, I wasn't a fan of the orange chicken because I felt like I was paying $14 for the orange chicken here, and I could pay like $6 over at the little Mon Pod Chinese restaurant, and the orange chicken was just as good, if not better.

168
00:18:02,821 --> 00:18:07,684
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was one of those things where like, okay, well, you're paying for atmosphere, but the host that we had was kind of a doof.

169
00:18:10,595 --> 00:18:10,956
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

170
00:18:12,396 --> 00:18:15,478
[SPEAKER_06]: Luckily, the cheesecake itself was really, really good.

171
00:18:15,558 --> 00:18:19,580
[SPEAKER_06]: So at least, if you're going to call your restaurant the Cheesecake Factory, you should have good cheesecake.

172
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:20,720
[SPEAKER_06]: And that they did.

173
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,602
[SPEAKER_06]: So I forgive them for at least having subpar rest of their food.

174
00:18:25,002 --> 00:18:31,025
[SPEAKER_06]: But still, the bill being quite a large amount of money for three people, I expected more.

175
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:31,405
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

176
00:18:31,445 --> 00:18:34,287
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanted showgirls dancing or something.

177
00:18:34,327 --> 00:18:35,668
[SPEAKER_06]: I expected more.

178
00:18:36,228 --> 00:18:38,689
[SPEAKER_05]: Our waitress at the San Francisco restaurant juggled

179
00:18:39,213 --> 00:18:39,973
[SPEAKER_05]: Ketchup Packets.

180
00:18:40,533 --> 00:18:41,494
[SPEAKER_05]: So she earned her tip.

181
00:18:42,474 --> 00:18:42,934
[SPEAKER_14]: Where was this at?

182
00:18:42,994 --> 00:18:44,914
[SPEAKER_14]: The San Diego one is really the best one I've been to.

183
00:18:45,174 --> 00:18:46,175
[SPEAKER_05]: It's in San Francisco.

184
00:18:46,255 --> 00:18:48,155
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the top of Macy's.

185
00:18:49,915 --> 00:18:52,136
[SPEAKER_06]: It's on the 13th floor or something like that.

186
00:18:52,156 --> 00:18:52,496
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

187
00:18:53,096 --> 00:18:58,657
[SPEAKER_05]: And basically you can go walk over and look at the balcony and stuff on top of the roof there.

188
00:18:59,417 --> 00:19:04,758
[SPEAKER_05]: They had some stupid Christian thing going on after the gay pride parade.

189
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:07,019
[SPEAKER_05]: They equal everything out.

190
00:19:08,956 --> 00:19:10,457
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

191
00:19:38,755 --> 00:19:39,355
[SPEAKER_13]: Us, of course.

192
00:19:39,435 --> 00:19:40,436
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, you want to talk about us?

193
00:19:40,776 --> 00:19:42,436
[SPEAKER_06]: So we were on the news this week.

194
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:46,077
[SPEAKER_06]: They came out to do a story.

195
00:19:46,177 --> 00:19:46,818
[SPEAKER_06]: When were they out here?

196
00:19:46,878 --> 00:19:47,178
[SPEAKER_06]: Monday?

197
00:19:47,378 --> 00:19:47,738
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

198
00:19:48,018 --> 00:19:48,978
[SPEAKER_06]: They were out here Monday.

199
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:57,901
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, they were out here originally on Friday, or they were supposed to be out here originally on Friday, but real news happened somewhere, so we got bumped to Monday.

200
00:19:58,281 --> 00:20:00,822
[SPEAKER_06]: But they were out here, and the reporter guy was very, very nice.

201
00:20:01,543 --> 00:20:01,683
[SPEAKER_06]: And...

202
00:20:03,917 --> 00:20:04,477
[SPEAKER_06]: The Cameraman.

203
00:20:04,497 --> 00:20:05,898
[SPEAKER_06]: They actually stayed quite a while.

204
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:08,118
[SPEAKER_06]: They were probably here for about an hour just filming different things.

205
00:20:08,459 --> 00:20:16,101
[SPEAKER_06]: They filmed interviews with all three of us, and then they filmed us playing DDR on my new TV, which was pretty cool.

206
00:20:17,122 --> 00:20:18,682
[SPEAKER_06]: Always a bad sign.

207
00:20:19,222 --> 00:20:23,544
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I got a note here that says I got to take a picture of you guys playing DDR.

208
00:20:23,944 --> 00:20:25,024
[SPEAKER_05]: What does that have to do with our show?

209
00:20:27,065 --> 00:20:27,345
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing.

210
00:20:28,225 --> 00:20:29,886
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I'm supposed to do that.

211
00:20:31,235 --> 00:20:36,226
[SPEAKER_06]: always a bad sign you're just bitter because your feet always somehow end up in it somehow

212
00:20:39,194 --> 00:20:40,675
[SPEAKER_07]: We did our research a lot.

213
00:20:41,295 --> 00:20:43,116
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys play during the show, don't you?

214
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:43,856
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't you?

215
00:20:44,136 --> 00:20:44,616
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't you?

216
00:20:44,876 --> 00:20:45,277
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't you?

217
00:20:45,717 --> 00:20:46,657
[SPEAKER_07]: No, you idiot.

218
00:20:46,757 --> 00:20:47,337
[SPEAKER_06]: We do not.

219
00:20:47,377 --> 00:20:48,078
[SPEAKER_06]: We have.

220
00:20:48,418 --> 00:20:49,658
[SPEAKER_06]: We did like twice.

221
00:20:49,898 --> 00:20:53,820
[SPEAKER_06]: We did the Xbox Live tournament online, which nobody showed up for.

222
00:20:54,260 --> 00:21:00,442
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember we were going to have our big gala 16 person DDR online tournament and then like four people showed up.

223
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:02,263
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember anything about that.

224
00:21:02,941 --> 00:21:04,622
[SPEAKER_06]: It must have been a week you weren't here or something.

225
00:21:04,642 --> 00:21:05,482
[SPEAKER_07]: It was.

226
00:21:06,522 --> 00:21:07,243
[SPEAKER_06]: You remember this, right?

227
00:21:07,303 --> 00:21:08,363
[SPEAKER_07]: It was an impromptu.

228
00:21:09,243 --> 00:21:12,705
[SPEAKER_07]: It was when we were unveiling Ultramix 2 or something like that.

229
00:21:13,225 --> 00:21:13,785
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what it was.

230
00:21:13,825 --> 00:21:15,266
[SPEAKER_07]: It was one of those unveiling shows.

231
00:21:15,286 --> 00:21:21,388
[SPEAKER_06]: And we tried to get all these people to come and only four people showed up, which shows you how many people listen to this program.

232
00:21:24,524 --> 00:21:27,586
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I mean, people are on Xbox Live and we'll see, whatever.

233
00:21:27,926 --> 00:21:30,428
[SPEAKER_06]: And have Ultramix too, I don't know, I guess not that many, but we'll see.

234
00:21:30,828 --> 00:21:38,192
[SPEAKER_06]: So we tried to do that and it failed miserably, but we have done the play DDR thing on the show before, it's just not the focus about our show.

235
00:21:38,552 --> 00:21:47,257
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess, you know, and we do talk about DDR, we talk about 2DX on the show, so I see where they get that impression, but the playing DDR on the show was a little crazy.

236
00:21:47,337 --> 00:21:49,358
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently, we talk about it on the podcast too.

237
00:21:50,239 --> 00:21:50,619
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so...

238
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:52,239
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, you haven't seen this yet, right?

239
00:22:19,898 --> 00:22:25,181
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura is going to get to see this for the very first time, so here we go.

240
00:22:25,422 --> 00:22:26,642
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't want anybody to see me though.

241
00:22:27,543 --> 00:22:27,923
[SPEAKER_06]: Too late.

242
00:22:28,143 --> 00:22:28,583
[SPEAKER_06]: Too late?

243
00:22:28,603 --> 00:22:29,404
[SPEAKER_06]: You were on the news!

244
00:22:31,305 --> 00:22:32,205
[SPEAKER_14]: Too damn late!

245
00:22:32,446 --> 00:22:35,788
[SPEAKER_14]: I needed to ask to be pixelated and have them spell my name right!

246
00:22:35,868 --> 00:22:39,670
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe I should have been the spokesperson because that's the only way I'm going to get on air.

247
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:45,913
[SPEAKER_06]: When you see what they did to Loki, Extifer, my roommate and I, laughed until we peed.

248
00:22:46,033 --> 00:22:46,754
[SPEAKER_06]: It was so funny.

249
00:22:47,594 --> 00:22:48,315
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, here we go.

250
00:22:48,988 --> 00:22:51,810
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck.

251
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:55,473
[SPEAKER_01]: The governor is one of the many people joining the podcasting craze.

252
00:22:55,553 --> 00:22:58,235
[SPEAKER_01]: It's becoming a web craze, but what is it?

253
00:22:58,375 --> 00:22:58,935
[SPEAKER_01]: How does it work?

254
00:22:59,015 --> 00:23:06,581
[SPEAKER_01]: KCRA 3's Brian Hickey tonight shows us how people are using podcasting to inform, entertain, and share their thoughts with the world.

255
00:23:07,236 --> 00:23:10,197
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, this report comes from a local news station, Channel 3.

256
00:23:10,997 --> 00:23:13,197
[SPEAKER_06]: And the reporter was very nice.

257
00:23:13,657 --> 00:23:14,457
[SPEAKER_06]: He was a very nice man.

258
00:23:14,517 --> 00:23:15,238
[SPEAKER_06]: I liked him.

259
00:23:15,398 --> 00:23:15,798
[SPEAKER_06]: He was good.

260
00:23:15,838 --> 00:23:21,739
[SPEAKER_06]: And he had done his research because I was very impressed with what he did know about the station before he came here.

261
00:23:21,779 --> 00:23:25,600
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, I know he'd been talking to you quite a bit, so you probably filled him in on all that.

262
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:25,960
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course!

263
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,601
[SPEAKER_06]: When he headed off to the editors, all hell breaks loose.

264
00:23:30,761 --> 00:23:31,561
[SPEAKER_06]: Hold on, hold on.

265
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:42,142
[SPEAKER_15]: and there's Jamie playing DDR.

266
00:23:42,802 --> 00:23:44,862
[SPEAKER_15]: It started off tiny and it's grown.

267
00:23:49,343 --> 00:23:51,384
[SPEAKER_06]: It started off tiny and it's grown.

268
00:23:54,405 --> 00:23:59,806
[SPEAKER_06]: If I didn't know you were talking about a podcast there, I could sell that clip for some blackmail.

269
00:23:59,826 --> 00:24:00,226
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's us.

270
00:24:05,733 --> 00:24:09,965
[SPEAKER_06]: I would like to point out that they may not realize it, but look what they're showing in the background.

271
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:11,740
[SPEAKER_06]: Did they blur that out?

272
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:12,280
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't tell.

273
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:13,461
[SPEAKER_06]: It's too far away.

274
00:24:13,501 --> 00:24:17,884
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, there's the Jay and Silent Bob poster, which hangs here in the studio.

275
00:24:17,924 --> 00:24:22,147
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a Jay and Silent Bob poster, and I quote, All you motherfuckers are gonna pay.

276
00:24:22,247 --> 00:24:23,829
[SPEAKER_06]: You are the ones who are the ball lickers.

277
00:24:23,869 --> 00:24:26,991
[SPEAKER_06]: We're gonna fuck your mothers while you watch and cry like little whiny bitches.

278
00:24:27,431 --> 00:24:36,218
[SPEAKER_06]: Once we get to Hollywood and find those Miramax fucks who's making the movie, we're gonna make them eat our shit, then shit out our shit, then eat their shit, which is made up of our shit that we made them eat.

279
00:24:36,818 --> 00:24:38,399
[SPEAKER_06]: And then all you motherfuckers are next.

280
00:24:38,459 --> 00:24:39,220
[SPEAKER_06]: Love, Jay and Silent Bob.

281
00:24:40,726 --> 00:24:43,689
[SPEAKER_06]: You can actually see that poster in the background a little bit.

282
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:45,571
[SPEAKER_14]: And we digress a bit.

283
00:24:45,611 --> 00:24:46,692
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's go ahead and keep going.

284
00:24:46,752 --> 00:24:47,013
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

285
00:24:47,633 --> 00:24:48,374
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't look hideous.

286
00:24:48,715 --> 00:24:53,740
[SPEAKER_06]: Look, if we could get the word fuck on the news in any way, shape, or form, I think that's worth a comment.

287
00:24:54,501 --> 00:24:55,201
[SPEAKER_13]: We've done our job.

288
00:24:56,082 --> 00:24:56,703
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, here we go.

289
00:24:56,943 --> 00:25:00,587
[SPEAKER_06]: We should report ourselves to the MPA.

290
00:25:00,647 --> 00:25:01,428
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me roll it back a little.

291
00:25:01,448 --> 00:25:03,170
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we're going to have to re-rate our show adults only.

292
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:03,430
[SPEAKER_06]: Hold on.

293
00:25:04,286 --> 00:25:06,048
[SPEAKER_11]: A subculture of pop culture.

294
00:25:06,388 --> 00:25:09,731
[SPEAKER_11]: And these are the voices to unite and inform the gaming fans.

295
00:25:10,112 --> 00:25:12,594
[SPEAKER_11]: And where am I?

296
00:25:12,995 --> 00:25:16,738
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, stop, stop.

297
00:25:17,219 --> 00:25:19,321
[SPEAKER_07]: I would like to note, where am I?

298
00:25:19,701 --> 00:25:20,682
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, there are my feet!

299
00:25:20,782 --> 00:25:21,543
[SPEAKER_07]: But where am I?

300
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:23,906
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's right, they cut me behind the goddamn door.

301
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:27,581
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

302
00:25:51,411 --> 00:25:58,218
[SPEAKER_06]: and you can see me doing the chatting and then you see Loki's feet dangling and his belly kind of hanging out from behind the corner

303
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:00,290
[SPEAKER_14]: I look so short.

304
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:01,791
[SPEAKER_14]: My feet don't touch the ground.

305
00:26:02,211 --> 00:26:06,372
[SPEAKER_04]: And when they say, you're right, your feet are dangling.

306
00:26:06,392 --> 00:26:07,132
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, look at my feet.

307
00:26:07,212 --> 00:26:08,773
[SPEAKER_04]: You look like you're sitting in Santa's lap.

308
00:26:11,513 --> 00:26:11,753
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

309
00:26:11,974 --> 00:26:14,554
[SPEAKER_06]: But when they go, these are the faces of Orange Lounge Radio.

310
00:26:14,594 --> 00:26:18,615
[SPEAKER_06]: They show Jamie, they show me, and then they cut to another picture.

311
00:26:21,176 --> 00:26:23,697
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, because I have a face for radio, apparently.

312
00:26:24,298 --> 00:26:27,499
[SPEAKER_06]: And those of you guys that are complaining that you can't see this, you will eventually.

313
00:26:27,559 --> 00:26:32,722
[SPEAKER_06]: We're working on, it's just a bandwidth thing right now, but we're going to get it uploaded sometime tonight.

314
00:26:32,762 --> 00:26:34,762
[SPEAKER_06]: So you guys will have it by tomorrow.

315
00:26:35,003 --> 00:26:36,363
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, here we go.

316
00:26:36,423 --> 00:26:38,164
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me finish the story here.

317
00:26:39,004 --> 00:26:42,286
[SPEAKER_11]: Welcome to another episode of our podcast.

318
00:26:42,666 --> 00:26:48,529
[SPEAKER_11]: From their apartment in Rancho Cordova, using revolutionary technology, they're podcasting to the world.

319
00:26:49,391 --> 00:26:51,774
[SPEAKER_06]: And apparently we all live in the same apartment.

320
00:26:51,794 --> 00:26:53,315
[SPEAKER_06]: I look horrible.

321
00:26:53,775 --> 00:26:55,457
[SPEAKER_14]: I look horrible.

322
00:26:55,557 --> 00:26:56,958
[SPEAKER_06]: I have you freeze-framed right now.

323
00:26:56,978 --> 00:26:58,620
[SPEAKER_06]: I look like I'm about to puke.

324
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:01,122
[SPEAKER_06]: The way you see my picture, it's even better.

325
00:27:01,262 --> 00:27:01,823
[SPEAKER_06]: Hold on, hold on.

326
00:27:01,863 --> 00:27:05,466
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me roll this back slightly so we can hear what Jamie has to say about podcasting.

327
00:27:06,307 --> 00:27:11,051
[SPEAKER_15]: We basically give the news for video games, popular culture...

328
00:27:11,784 --> 00:27:14,229
[SPEAKER_15]: Basically what gamers really want to know.

329
00:27:14,289 --> 00:27:17,595
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so they spelled Jamie's name right on the text over at least.

330
00:27:17,675 --> 00:27:20,020
[SPEAKER_06]: They didn't spell it right online, but they spelled it right on the text over.

331
00:27:21,159 --> 00:27:26,823
[SPEAKER_11]: ...podcast producers record their programs, then send them to a number of websites now hosting the shows.

332
00:27:27,323 --> 00:27:30,585
[SPEAKER_11]: Now anyone can create, edit, and... Ooh, David shot at me.

333
00:27:30,885 --> 00:27:34,007
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, but no pictures of me.

334
00:27:34,047 --> 00:27:38,349
[SPEAKER_15]: Lots of pictures of Rob, lots of pictures of Jamie, but no Matt.

335
00:27:38,369 --> 00:27:41,011
[SPEAKER_15]: Hold on, I didn't hear what Jamie said there.

336
00:27:41,031 --> 00:27:41,691
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got to roll it back.

337
00:27:41,851 --> 00:27:44,293
[SPEAKER_11]: ...to anyone else willing to download it.

338
00:27:44,513 --> 00:27:45,754
[SPEAKER_15]: It's something they can take with them.

339
00:27:46,134 --> 00:27:49,396
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a much more flexible way of spreading the information.

340
00:27:49,898 --> 00:27:54,663
[SPEAKER_11]: With nothing more than an MP3 player and a set of headphones, you can listen to it anywhere.

341
00:27:55,424 --> 00:27:58,367
[SPEAKER_12]: Now people can talk about things they like to talk about.

342
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:00,469
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, who's this random guy?

343
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:04,053
[SPEAKER_06]: Now they're interviewing random guy on the skateboard.

344
00:28:04,394 --> 00:28:05,575
[SPEAKER_06]: Like some dude they found.

345
00:28:05,595 --> 00:28:06,276
[SPEAKER_14]: Where's the name?

346
00:28:06,316 --> 00:28:07,157
[SPEAKER_14]: Casey Ryle.

347
00:28:07,177 --> 00:28:07,337
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

348
00:28:07,717 --> 00:28:27,601
[SPEAKER_06]: If you listen to our show, email us If Casey listens to the show, the more power to him I'm glad one of our listeners got to be a media whore But I'd also like to point out, Casey only owns an iPod Shuffle So he's not even that hardcore Anyway Again, if I didn't know he was talking about podcasting, I'd find that pretty amusing

349
00:28:38,876 --> 00:28:39,437
[SPEAKER_06]: What grade am I in?

350
00:28:39,457 --> 00:28:39,717
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep playing.

351
00:28:39,737 --> 00:28:41,018
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me get the reporter here.

352
00:28:41,098 --> 00:28:43,059
[SPEAKER_06]: I would like to point out that that is the only time in the entire

353
00:29:03,187 --> 00:29:09,652
[SPEAKER_06]: or in the entire news clip that our actual show name is put somewhere because they never say Orange Lounge Radio.

354
00:29:09,973 --> 00:29:14,476
[SPEAKER_06]: But when they're showing how to get to the podcast and stuff, that's when they bring up the Orange Lounge Radio.

355
00:29:14,536 --> 00:29:19,660
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like they show the person searching for Orange Lounge Radio and it comes up in our little entry into iTunes stores.

356
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,661
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you know, that's nice.

357
00:29:23,263 --> 00:29:23,683
[SPEAKER_05]: Good for them.

358
00:29:23,723 --> 00:29:25,084
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm glad they plugged the show.

359
00:29:25,645 --> 00:29:27,406
[SPEAKER_06]: Like maybe the SACB did.

360
00:29:27,426 --> 00:29:29,728
[SPEAKER_06]: At least they put our damn URL in there.

361
00:29:29,868 --> 00:29:32,050
[SPEAKER_06]: Extifer, do you still think the reporter was cute?

362
00:29:34,184 --> 00:29:36,406
[SPEAKER_21]: I did think the reporter was cute, actually.

363
00:29:36,766 --> 00:29:38,608
[SPEAKER_21]: I still, I hold to that.

364
00:29:38,888 --> 00:29:39,269
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

365
00:29:42,271 --> 00:29:42,732
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

366
00:29:58,118 --> 00:29:59,882
[SPEAKER_06]: That lot could be some podcasts.

367
00:29:59,922 --> 00:30:01,124
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you see?

368
00:30:01,465 --> 00:30:05,693
[SPEAKER_06]: First of all, they have Loki sitting in DarkSakura's chair, but oh, it's so much fun.

369
00:30:06,713 --> 00:30:07,554
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, God, you guys.

370
00:30:08,254 --> 00:30:11,236
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't even have my goddamn name on there.

371
00:30:11,617 --> 00:30:12,797
[SPEAKER_07]: Where's my name on there?

372
00:30:13,218 --> 00:30:15,019
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, God, you guys, that's so much fun.

373
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:16,960
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, it's so much fun.

374
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:18,061
[SPEAKER_07]: What's so much fun?

375
00:30:18,361 --> 00:30:19,282
[SPEAKER_07]: What am I talking about?

376
00:30:19,802 --> 00:30:22,204
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Kelly people, it's so much fun.

377
00:30:22,785 --> 00:30:25,867
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you know, Klostomy, that's so much fun.

378
00:30:26,107 --> 00:30:27,688
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, what the hell am I talking about?

379
00:30:27,708 --> 00:30:28,749
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't say anything.

380
00:30:28,809 --> 00:30:29,629
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just retarded.

381
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:32,391
[SPEAKER_07]: I said a whole lot more than just, oh, it's so much fun.

382
00:30:32,712 --> 00:30:33,432
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, it's so much fun.

383
00:30:33,752 --> 00:30:34,393
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, it's so much fun.

384
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:37,520
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, look at that!

385
00:30:37,761 --> 00:30:39,502
[SPEAKER_07]: I look like a goddamn chipmunk!

386
00:30:39,742 --> 00:30:41,884
[SPEAKER_07]: My head looks like it has exploded!

387
00:30:44,305 --> 00:30:46,487
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I'm super fat!

388
00:30:46,567 --> 00:30:47,388
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at me!

389
00:30:47,548 --> 00:30:51,511
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so much fun being a... Did you think that maybe you are super fat?

390
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:53,272
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I am not!

391
00:30:53,472 --> 00:30:54,153
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not like that!

392
00:30:54,173 --> 00:30:56,654
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just having a momentary mental image of Krim.

393
00:30:59,396 --> 00:31:03,019
[SPEAKER_07]: Me and that shit, we go... It was a night out.

394
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:06,960
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, let me see.

395
00:31:07,501 --> 00:31:08,561
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me see.

396
00:31:09,161 --> 00:31:12,203
[SPEAKER_17]: Let me see if I can.

397
00:31:12,743 --> 00:31:14,224
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, let me see if I can.

398
00:31:15,124 --> 00:31:16,065
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me see if I can.

399
00:31:16,945 --> 00:31:18,006
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me see if I can cue this up.

400
00:31:18,046 --> 00:31:20,147
[SPEAKER_14]: That should be in the next intro.

401
00:31:20,387 --> 00:31:20,727
[SPEAKER_06]: Hold on.

402
00:31:21,467 --> 00:31:21,708
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

403
00:31:22,328 --> 00:31:25,049
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, Loki, what do you think about gay sex?

404
00:31:25,369 --> 00:31:26,370
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it's so much fun.

405
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:39,250
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't worry, this will be continued later in FG's.

406
00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:40,911
[SPEAKER_05]: I have not forgot about them.

407
00:31:43,131 --> 00:31:44,372
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's let this finish up here.

408
00:31:44,492 --> 00:31:45,912
[SPEAKER_06]: Speech for everyone.

409
00:31:46,292 --> 00:31:47,252
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it's so much fun.

410
00:31:47,512 --> 00:31:53,934
[SPEAKER_06]: It's great that, you know, just anybody out there who really has a desire to want to be heard, you have an outlet for your voice to get out there.

411
00:31:53,954 --> 00:31:55,954
[SPEAKER_06]: God damn, I can't believe I let people watch this.

412
00:31:56,454 --> 00:31:58,795
[SPEAKER_11]: In Rancho Cordova, Brian Hickey, KCRA 3 reports.

413
00:32:00,359 --> 00:32:01,740
[SPEAKER_01]: See, everybody's a broadcaster now.

414
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:04,460
[SPEAKER_01]: Recently, Governor Schwarzenegger began... Oh, good for the governor!

415
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,601
[SPEAKER_01]: He gets a fucking plug, but do we know?

416
00:32:06,621 --> 00:32:08,522
[SPEAKER_01]: What the fuck is up with him?

417
00:32:08,702 --> 00:32:13,344
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can listen to it in the car, in the walk, or even in the gym.

418
00:32:16,305 --> 00:32:19,606
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm sure his podcast is very easy to listen to.

419
00:32:20,226 --> 00:32:24,808
[SPEAKER_07]: When you understand half the words... We're going to slash the budget now!

420
00:32:26,684 --> 00:32:28,529
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for downloading my podcast!

421
00:32:31,918 --> 00:32:32,681
[SPEAKER_13]: It's so much fun.

422
00:32:34,821 --> 00:32:36,941
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's... I love my podcast!

423
00:32:37,182 --> 00:32:38,222
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so much fun!

424
00:32:38,562 --> 00:32:40,222
[SPEAKER_04]: It's tiny, but it's good!

425
00:32:40,242 --> 00:32:46,664
[SPEAKER_04]: All of you that own iPod shuffles, the iPod shuffles are the girly mans of iPods!

426
00:32:47,344 --> 00:32:57,106
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so not only did they not plug our show, not even mention who our show was, not even put me on there, gave me some really crappy line, one I had a whole lot more to say, you know?

427
00:32:57,686 --> 00:32:58,006
[SPEAKER_07]: What's that?

428
00:32:58,427 --> 00:33:00,689
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so basically we're going to ask you a lot of questions.

429
00:33:00,709 --> 00:33:07,195
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to get you saying something really stupid, cut to you for about a second, because we know we have to, and then we're done.

430
00:33:08,896 --> 00:33:09,397
[SPEAKER_05]: What the hell?

431
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:11,839
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up with that?

432
00:33:12,119 --> 00:33:14,121
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like the pictures of podcasting.

433
00:33:14,221 --> 00:33:15,202
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, oh, we forgot one.

434
00:33:16,924 --> 00:33:18,085
[SPEAKER_14]: I had a cleavage shot.

435
00:33:18,205 --> 00:33:19,366
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like, gee.

436
00:33:19,406 --> 00:33:19,726
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

437
00:33:21,571 --> 00:33:26,937
[SPEAKER_14]: Orange Lounge Radio has more name recognition than Arnold Schwarzenegger.

438
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,620
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, someday we will.

439
00:33:42,381 --> 00:33:44,742
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we can if people don't fucking plug our show.

440
00:33:45,142 --> 00:33:45,622
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello?

441
00:33:45,962 --> 00:33:46,583
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, come on.

442
00:33:46,663 --> 00:33:47,843
[SPEAKER_07]: How long is it going to take?

443
00:33:48,304 --> 00:33:49,844
[SPEAKER_07]: Take the extra two seconds.

444
00:33:50,424 --> 00:33:51,505
[SPEAKER_07]: You can find this podcast here.

445
00:33:51,565 --> 00:33:51,785
[SPEAKER_07]: Boop.

446
00:33:51,885 --> 00:33:53,646
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, put the URL up there.

447
00:33:53,926 --> 00:33:54,246
[SPEAKER_07]: Done.

448
00:33:54,526 --> 00:33:59,729
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, or just say, you know, just like this show out of Sacramento, Orange Launch Radio.

449
00:33:59,909 --> 00:34:01,309
[SPEAKER_07]: Just mention the name once.

450
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:03,631
[SPEAKER_07]: Once is all we're asking.

451
00:34:03,751 --> 00:34:04,711
[SPEAKER_07]: Show the website.

452
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:05,431
[SPEAKER_07]: Show something.

453
00:34:05,451 --> 00:34:08,833
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you think that maybe we don't get our name on TV because here we are just...

454
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:11,881
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck them!

455
00:34:12,161 --> 00:34:12,982
[SPEAKER_07]: Sack beat all the way!

456
00:34:13,022 --> 00:34:15,803
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't give a shit if my goddamn foot was in there and that was it.

457
00:34:16,083 --> 00:34:17,664
[SPEAKER_07]: At least they fucking mentioned our show.

458
00:34:17,704 --> 00:34:20,245
[SPEAKER_07]: The hell with them, because they made me look like a fucking idiot.

459
00:34:23,107 --> 00:34:24,547
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I have to say about that.

460
00:34:26,848 --> 00:34:28,209
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't give a crap, okay?

461
00:34:28,369 --> 00:34:34,032
[SPEAKER_07]: I honestly don't give a... If they showed me at least saying something intelligent, like, podcasting, you know, we've, you know...

462
00:34:34,414 --> 00:34:36,275
[SPEAKER_07]: So, Loki, what do you think of your anger management courses?

463
00:34:36,295 --> 00:34:36,916
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, it's so much fun.

464
00:35:06,115 --> 00:35:07,555
[SPEAKER_07]: I know what this is going to turn into.

465
00:35:08,476 --> 00:35:10,636
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be just like the other goddamn thing.

466
00:35:10,856 --> 00:35:13,597
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, oh, I shot my foot.

467
00:35:13,617 --> 00:35:15,698
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki, you're purple in the face.

468
00:35:16,898 --> 00:35:17,918
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not purple in the face.

469
00:35:18,878 --> 00:35:19,379
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm angry.

470
00:35:20,279 --> 00:35:21,519
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you see your face?

471
00:35:22,059 --> 00:35:22,780
[SPEAKER_05]: You are purple.

472
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:24,980
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not purple.

473
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,120
[SPEAKER_07]: You're splotchy.

474
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:27,041
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, no, I'm violet.

475
00:35:27,781 --> 00:35:28,401
[SPEAKER_07]: Damn gum.

476
00:35:28,821 --> 00:35:29,261
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, anyways.

477
00:35:31,522 --> 00:35:32,502
[SPEAKER_07]: I turned into a blueberry.

478
00:35:35,283 --> 00:35:35,543
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

479
00:35:38,323 --> 00:35:39,283
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it's so much fun.

480
00:35:39,743 --> 00:35:40,624
[SPEAKER_06]: I couldn't resist.

481
00:35:40,644 --> 00:35:41,484
[SPEAKER_06]: I had to do it one more time.

482
00:35:42,224 --> 00:35:42,524
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

483
00:35:42,544 --> 00:35:44,085
[SPEAKER_07]: That won't be the last time, I'm sure.

484
00:35:44,105 --> 00:35:44,625
[SPEAKER_06]: Moving on.

485
00:35:44,965 --> 00:35:49,646
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be cut down into a little clip, and then you're going to be like, hey, Matt.

486
00:35:49,666 --> 00:35:50,687
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, Logan, what do you think about this?

487
00:35:51,287 --> 00:35:52,067
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it's so much fun.

488
00:35:52,487 --> 00:35:53,247
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it's so much fun.

489
00:35:53,447 --> 00:35:54,648
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, oh, oh, it's so much fun.

490
00:35:55,728 --> 00:35:56,148
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

491
00:35:56,188 --> 00:36:00,009
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe we could compile some of this together and remix it.

492
00:36:00,069 --> 00:36:00,630
[SPEAKER_06]: I have an idea.

493
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:05,171
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's send them a friendly letter commenting on how wonderful they covered our show.

494
00:36:06,307 --> 00:36:09,308
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sitting here going, you know what?

495
00:36:09,748 --> 00:36:12,348
[SPEAKER_06]: No TV station give a rat's ass about us before.

496
00:36:12,908 --> 00:36:13,809
[SPEAKER_14]: I look at it this way.

497
00:36:13,869 --> 00:36:15,769
[SPEAKER_14]: It was about podcasting.

498
00:36:16,489 --> 00:36:19,870
[SPEAKER_14]: We were just podcasters who were convenient and had the most interesting material.

499
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:22,751
[SPEAKER_06]: We were just pawns in the big operation, really.

500
00:36:23,411 --> 00:36:24,451
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn the man!

501
00:36:25,051 --> 00:36:27,332
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm glad they mentioned everybody on the show.

502
00:36:27,432 --> 00:36:28,292
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh wait, no they didn't.

503
00:36:28,332 --> 00:36:29,072
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right, they didn't.

504
00:36:31,132 --> 00:36:31,432
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever.

505
00:36:33,753 --> 00:36:33,973
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

506
00:36:34,491 --> 00:36:35,932
[SPEAKER_06]: We are going to put that up on the internet.

507
00:36:36,132 --> 00:36:37,032
[SPEAKER_06]: Check our website.

508
00:36:37,333 --> 00:36:38,653
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys will be able to download it soon.

509
00:36:38,673 --> 00:36:40,794
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, big goddamn... You know what they're going to do?

510
00:36:40,814 --> 00:36:43,376
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to play this at my work in front of goddamn 100 people.

511
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:45,317
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, it's so much fun.

512
00:36:45,717 --> 00:36:48,859
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're going to hear all goddamn day long next week.

513
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:49,659
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay!

514
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:51,740
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, great new week!

515
00:36:52,441 --> 00:36:53,761
[SPEAKER_07]: Perfect way to start it off!

516
00:36:53,861 --> 00:36:55,642
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, KCRA3!

517
00:36:55,982 --> 00:36:57,023
[SPEAKER_07]: I cannot wait!

518
00:36:58,504 --> 00:36:59,064
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you done?

519
00:36:59,344 --> 00:36:59,464
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

520
00:36:59,484 --> 00:37:00,085
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you done yet?

521
00:37:00,125 --> 00:37:00,305
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

522
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:00,725
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

523
00:37:01,266 --> 00:37:02,967
[SPEAKER_14]: I have actually news that happened to me this week.

524
00:37:03,147 --> 00:37:03,547
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, what's that?

525
00:37:03,767 --> 00:37:05,148
[SPEAKER_14]: Now that I'm no longer bitter.

526
00:37:05,708 --> 00:37:08,430
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, I'm going to be addressing most of it during the FUs of the week.

527
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:09,270
[SPEAKER_06]: My work.

528
00:37:10,751 --> 00:37:11,491
[SPEAKER_14]: My package arrived.

529
00:37:11,851 --> 00:37:12,352
[SPEAKER_14]: My prize.

530
00:37:13,552 --> 00:37:14,173
[SPEAKER_06]: Your package?

531
00:37:14,693 --> 00:37:16,174
[SPEAKER_06]: Did it start off small and get a little bit bigger?

532
00:37:19,355 --> 00:37:20,436
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, no, seriously, what is it?

533
00:37:21,016 --> 00:37:21,897
[SPEAKER_14]: My gorilla stuff.

534
00:37:22,257 --> 00:37:22,697
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's right.

535
00:37:22,737 --> 00:37:23,918
[SPEAKER_06]: You were a winner on some stuff.

536
00:37:24,018 --> 00:37:24,858
[SPEAKER_14]: I am a winner.

537
00:37:25,899 --> 00:37:27,980
[SPEAKER_14]: I won shit that wasn't really shit.

538
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:28,580
[SPEAKER_14]: It was really cool.

539
00:37:29,724 --> 00:37:30,684
[SPEAKER_06]: What kind of stuff did you win?

540
00:37:30,944 --> 00:37:32,405
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, it was from Filter Magazine.

541
00:37:33,545 --> 00:37:38,607
[SPEAKER_14]: And first of all, it was going to be just a CD and the autographed magazine.

542
00:37:38,767 --> 00:37:40,868
[SPEAKER_14]: I had misunderstood the first email, the price.

543
00:37:41,768 --> 00:37:51,392
[SPEAKER_14]: But since I already had the CD, and since I actually, you know, when I was talking, I had to actually call the lady to give her my change of address because she didn't get my return email.

544
00:37:52,152 --> 00:37:55,153
[SPEAKER_14]: And we were just talking about stuff, and, you know, I said that, you know,

545
00:37:56,135 --> 00:38:01,199
[SPEAKER_14]: I actually, uh, moderate on Gorillas Unofficial, which is a really cool site for anyone interested.

546
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:04,382
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, but, uh, what?

547
00:38:06,924 --> 00:38:10,587
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing, just something, I was giggling at something a listener wants to say.

548
00:38:10,647 --> 00:38:10,727
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey!

549
00:38:10,747 --> 00:38:11,167
[SPEAKER_06]: Jamie time!

550
00:38:11,187 --> 00:38:11,488
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

551
00:38:13,009 --> 00:38:15,591
[SPEAKER_14]: You can either pay attention to me or piss off, okay?

552
00:38:16,231 --> 00:38:16,712
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

553
00:38:18,053 --> 00:38:19,314
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, as I was saying...

554
00:38:21,056 --> 00:38:30,302
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, because, because, you know, I wasn't just some random person filling out the, the little prize thingy.

555
00:38:30,382 --> 00:38:36,746
[SPEAKER_14]: I actually got, um, a mobile that I haven't seen anywhere else except a couple of lists that I saw on eBay, but that's like it.

556
00:38:37,426 --> 00:38:46,692
[SPEAKER_14]: And I got, um, the autographed magazine, and I got, uh, the sticker sheet, and the little promo book that's like, ooh, cool promo book.

557
00:38:48,453 --> 00:38:49,874
[SPEAKER_06]: So how much would you say all this is worth?

558
00:38:50,549 --> 00:38:50,969
[SPEAKER_14]: On eBay?

559
00:38:51,169 --> 00:38:51,329
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

560
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:53,390
[SPEAKER_14]: I've seen the promo book go for a lot of money.

561
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:54,191
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool.

562
00:38:54,971 --> 00:38:57,592
[SPEAKER_06]: So... So what are you going to do with it?

563
00:38:57,612 --> 00:38:59,173
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you going to put it on display in your house somewhere?

564
00:38:59,193 --> 00:39:02,714
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you going to keep it locked away in a little box to take out on days when you need some gorillas?

565
00:39:03,915 --> 00:39:04,255
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

566
00:39:04,315 --> 00:39:07,356
[SPEAKER_06]: What do people do with these things?

567
00:39:07,436 --> 00:39:07,836
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

568
00:39:08,256 --> 00:39:10,137
[SPEAKER_06]: I've never won anything like that before, really.

569
00:39:10,177 --> 00:39:12,958
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, Dan and I have actually been off looking at office furniture.

570
00:39:14,239 --> 00:39:19,621
[SPEAKER_14]: And so once we get the office set up, it's going to go in my area of our office.

571
00:39:22,182 --> 00:39:25,665
[SPEAKER_06]: The most exciting music-related thing I ever won was when I got to meet Matchbox 20.

572
00:39:26,986 --> 00:39:31,951
[SPEAKER_06]: I wasn't even that big a fan of them, but I just won tickets off the radio and backstage passes, so we got to go meet Matchbox 20.

573
00:39:32,571 --> 00:39:35,514
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I just have my little autograph hanging on the wall, but that's about it.

574
00:39:36,428 --> 00:39:41,052
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not really an autograph collector, you know, but this is just really cool.

575
00:39:41,873 --> 00:39:43,434
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not much of an autograph collector either.

576
00:39:43,514 --> 00:39:48,438
[SPEAKER_06]: However, I got Rob Thomas to sign my thing and it says, To Rob, I think you're cute.

577
00:39:49,059 --> 00:39:50,260
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's worth saving.

578
00:39:51,401 --> 00:39:52,041
[SPEAKER_14]: That's fun.

579
00:39:53,863 --> 00:39:56,665
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a whole story behind that, but I don't like the story.

580
00:39:56,846 --> 00:40:02,010
[SPEAKER_14]: When we get the scanner hooked up, I'm going to scan the magazine because I love how DJ Danger Mouth signs it.

581
00:40:03,157 --> 00:40:06,578
[SPEAKER_14]: He signs a DM with a circle around it, sort of like the old Danger Mouse logo.

582
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:08,679
[SPEAKER_14]: I thought that was pretty cool.

583
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:18,043
[SPEAKER_14]: I had major happy nerd moment right then, and they're just staring at it for about five minutes going, Ooh, Navy Seals!

584
00:40:18,543 --> 00:40:19,483
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, wrong movie.

585
00:40:21,644 --> 00:40:22,304
[SPEAKER_06]: Going back to it.

586
00:40:22,604 --> 00:40:26,026
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, since now we've had Jamie time, let's take a minute and have some Loki time.

587
00:40:27,766 --> 00:40:29,427
[SPEAKER_06]: God damn!

588
00:40:30,499 --> 00:40:31,400
[SPEAKER_07]: Out of my foot!

589
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:34,062
[SPEAKER_07]: Why did I shoot myself in my foot?

590
00:40:34,462 --> 00:40:36,264
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god, it hurts so bad!

591
00:40:39,386 --> 00:40:40,427
[SPEAKER_07]: No, my foot!

592
00:40:40,487 --> 00:40:41,668
[SPEAKER_07]: I need that for walking!

593
00:40:42,509 --> 00:40:44,711
[SPEAKER_06]: It's only funny if you were there for that episode.

594
00:40:45,371 --> 00:40:49,034
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, somebody in the chatroom asked if I still had that sound clip, so I just had to play it for them.

595
00:40:49,995 --> 00:40:51,937
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to have some Loki singing during the break.

596
00:40:52,317 --> 00:40:56,320
[SPEAKER_06]: We also... I think I actually deleted those mp3s finally.

597
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:56,941
[SPEAKER_18]: No!

598
00:40:57,181 --> 00:40:58,282
[SPEAKER_06]: I got them somewhere, I don't know.

599
00:40:58,302 --> 00:40:59,443
[SPEAKER_06]: They are safe in my... No!

600
00:41:01,081 --> 00:41:03,461
[SPEAKER_06]: Sakurina has a comment here in our chat room.

601
00:41:03,481 --> 00:41:08,602
[SPEAKER_06]: It has a suggestion for DarkSakura's next advice column on your show.

602
00:41:09,142 --> 00:41:12,003
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, the advice column's theme would be how to piss off Loki.

603
00:41:12,683 --> 00:41:13,223
[SPEAKER_06]: And here we go.

604
00:41:13,703 --> 00:41:15,724
[SPEAKER_06]: Number one, get his foot on TV.

605
00:41:16,664 --> 00:41:18,724
[SPEAKER_06]: Number two, oh my god, it's so much fun.

606
00:41:19,824 --> 00:41:22,245
[SPEAKER_06]: Number three, talk about how In The Groove is awesome.

607
00:41:23,185 --> 00:41:24,985
[SPEAKER_06]: Number four, say you'll buy him a Mac.

608
00:41:26,106 --> 00:41:28,406
[SPEAKER_06]: And the final piece of advice, just stay away.

609
00:41:30,089 --> 00:41:30,930
[SPEAKER_14]: That would piss him off.

610
00:41:32,091 --> 00:41:32,451
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

611
00:41:33,312 --> 00:41:40,798
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know how usually your final piece of advice is, you know, just don't, like when you're doing that, how to, you know, fly out of a cannon, your final piece of advice is don't get in the fucking cannon.

612
00:41:41,779 --> 00:41:48,584
[SPEAKER_14]: I was thinking that my advice was going to be on how to safely inflate your ego without it exploding into brain bits all over your company.

613
00:41:48,704 --> 00:41:49,505
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, that'll work.

614
00:41:49,985 --> 00:41:51,327
[SPEAKER_14]: I've been having lots of practice with that.

615
00:41:51,707 --> 00:41:53,128
[SPEAKER_05]: I have an advice column.

616
00:41:53,168 --> 00:41:54,829
[SPEAKER_05]: It's how to shoot an interview.

617
00:41:56,731 --> 00:41:57,912
[SPEAKER_05]: Because apparently, you know,

618
00:41:59,827 --> 00:42:02,836
[SPEAKER_05]: I was watching the other segments that they cut to.

619
00:42:04,244 --> 00:42:29,926
[SPEAKER_07]: Before ours, so meaning these were more important That would be that it's hot The same story they've covered all week Oh, guess what, it's still hot In case you didn't figure that out by walking outside Loki, if you wanted to headline the news Let's get Joe Hotperson on the street and see what he thinks It's hot out here Come on You know what, when I want to know exactly how hot it is I go to the Weather Channel's website and put in my damn zip code

620
00:42:30,973 --> 00:42:31,934
[SPEAKER_14]: And then I know it's hot.

621
00:42:32,194 --> 00:42:35,798
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, if you want to be headline news, kill someone.

622
00:42:36,298 --> 00:42:37,479
[SPEAKER_06]: Then you'll headline the news.

623
00:42:37,819 --> 00:42:38,580
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, thank you.

624
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:39,821
[SPEAKER_07]: And it'll be press for us.

625
00:42:39,861 --> 00:42:41,002
[SPEAKER_07]: We caught a killer today.

626
00:42:41,463 --> 00:42:44,246
[SPEAKER_14]: This guy's the host of Orange Lounge Radio.

627
00:42:44,786 --> 00:42:50,151
[SPEAKER_14]: Ghost poster and kills 50 nuns because his foot was the only thing on the TV.

628
00:42:54,522 --> 00:43:05,231
[SPEAKER_07]: I should be a reporter.

629
00:43:05,271 --> 00:43:11,295
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks like it's another crazy killer who is inspired by the Grand Theft Auto San Andreas games.

630
00:43:11,676 --> 00:43:17,000
[SPEAKER_06]: When asked about how much he enjoys Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, the killer replied, It's so much fun.

631
00:43:20,379 --> 00:43:24,244
[SPEAKER_14]: GameStop is no longer allowed to take them in as trade-ins.

632
00:43:31,909 --> 00:43:34,010
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, because they're not going to be selling it anymore.

633
00:43:58,476 --> 00:43:59,397
[SPEAKER_05]: Subtitles by the Amara.org community

634
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:18,864
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to save this for the podcast, but now you've got me on this subject, so I want to talk about this.

635
00:44:18,944 --> 00:44:22,527
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, we've seen this happen before, with DDR even, right?

636
00:44:22,947 --> 00:44:28,812
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember how when you put in the DDR USA, remember the very first release of DDR USA on the PlayStation?

637
00:44:29,152 --> 00:44:34,317
[SPEAKER_06]: As poopy of a game as it was, it was what got DDR in the door on PlayStation here in the U.S.,

638
00:44:34,717 --> 00:45:01,518
[SPEAKER_06]: remember that people put in that disc and they hacked it and what did they find on the disc they found the background for Butterfly and they found the background for Bad Girls but with the gun taken out so this obviously was at one point or another those songs were meant to be even if not Butterfly if they were just lazy from the Best Hits conversion and left that in there somebody altered the Bad Girls background that song was intended to be in DDR USA at one point or another but instead of

639
00:45:02,088 --> 00:45:11,394
[SPEAKER_06]: What they did, instead of removing the song, removing the background, removing everything from the code completely, all they did was they took the pointer out.

640
00:45:11,434 --> 00:45:14,637
[SPEAKER_06]: The thing that points to bad girls as being a song in the game, they took that out.

641
00:45:14,997 --> 00:45:17,719
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's exactly what they did with Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.

642
00:45:18,099 --> 00:45:22,462
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that this sex thing was intended to be in the game the whole time.

643
00:45:22,882 --> 00:45:30,455
[SPEAKER_06]: But during some final QA review process or something, they decided, you know what, if we have this sex thing in the game, I think that's crossing the line.

644
00:45:30,795 --> 00:45:37,246
[SPEAKER_06]: So instead of going through the efforts to take it out of the programming, which would be a pain in the ass, they simply took the pointer out.

645
00:45:38,254 --> 00:46:07,115
[SPEAKER_06]: and so they thought well if we just take the pointer out you take everything that points to the sex thing out nobody's going to find the sex thing because all the pointers are out whoops did they underestimate the PC hack community out there once the PC hack community found it it was just a matter of time before somebody got the codes to basically what they're doing is putting a pointer in that points back to the sex game and now it's this whole big thing of oh Rockstar Games knew it all along that they were going to have this sex game well yeah they knew they had a sex game in there but they thought they took it out

646
00:46:07,555 --> 00:46:10,337
[SPEAKER_06]: It's lazy programming, is what happened here, I think.

647
00:46:10,697 --> 00:46:13,778
[SPEAKER_05]: It's still retarded, though, that people are coming after this game.

648
00:46:13,878 --> 00:46:15,159
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyways, we'll see you on the third podcast.

649
00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:18,461
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, now you got me started on that.

650
00:46:19,521 --> 00:46:21,242
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's talk about how In the Groove sucks.

651
00:46:22,703 --> 00:46:25,304
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I'm gonna... We do that every show!

652
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:28,366
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, and I'm not even... I don't even think In the Groove sucks as much as you do.

653
00:46:28,386 --> 00:46:31,327
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't quite have the budget to buy In the Groove today.

654
00:46:31,347 --> 00:46:36,990
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought about doing it just so I could play it once and say it sucks, and then write it sucks ass on the front cover.

655
00:46:37,492 --> 00:46:39,514
[SPEAKER_05]: and then, you know, give it away.

656
00:46:40,254 --> 00:46:42,476
[SPEAKER_06]: But, yeah.

657
00:46:43,577 --> 00:46:47,141
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually plan on playing In the Groove 2 two weeks from now.

658
00:46:47,401 --> 00:46:56,529
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll be playing In the Groove 2 because I'm doing my East Coast trip and I'm going to go buy aid on the break while I'm out there and I'm going to check out In the Groove 2 so I can come back and give a review on the show.

659
00:46:57,525 --> 00:46:59,968
[SPEAKER_06]: I can tell Loki that it's probably not as bad as he thinks it is.

660
00:47:00,168 --> 00:47:00,888
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's going to be awesome.

661
00:47:00,909 --> 00:47:02,670
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to have it on a new HDTV.

662
00:47:03,491 --> 00:47:07,495
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's going to be really crisp and higher quality looking graphics.

663
00:47:07,515 --> 00:47:08,215
[SPEAKER_05]: They still suck!

664
00:47:08,676 --> 00:47:09,757
[SPEAKER_05]: They still suck!

665
00:47:10,257 --> 00:47:11,859
[SPEAKER_07]: They're just going to be on a bigger TV!

666
00:47:12,239 --> 00:47:13,400
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow, crap blown up!

667
00:47:18,705 --> 00:47:22,949
[SPEAKER_05]: Just like saying all the speakers in the world will not make those songs any better.

668
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:28,469
[SPEAKER_06]: What can he do?

669
00:47:29,029 --> 00:47:29,889
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe, you know what?

670
00:47:29,909 --> 00:47:30,890
[SPEAKER_07]: Knock it off!

671
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:33,251
[SPEAKER_07]: Stop playing the damn video clip!

672
00:47:33,291 --> 00:47:36,412
[SPEAKER_06]: I think, though, one day, one day, you guys, there's hope.

673
00:47:36,472 --> 00:47:37,552
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki will change his mind.

674
00:47:37,853 --> 00:47:41,094
[SPEAKER_06]: And we'll sit here and we'll ask him, Loki, what did you think of In The Groove 2?

675
00:47:41,334 --> 00:47:42,855
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it's so much fun.

676
00:47:44,135 --> 00:47:45,676
[SPEAKER_17]: For me to hope on!

677
00:47:50,118 --> 00:47:52,659
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we, like, change the topic to something I don't have to yell at?

678
00:47:53,092 --> 00:47:53,712
[SPEAKER_06]: Poppa Music

679
00:48:17,581 --> 00:48:19,943
[SPEAKER_06]: and we'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.

680
00:48:20,203 --> 00:48:22,905
[SPEAKER_06]: Your calls on the Skype line also in this very next break.

681
00:48:23,446 --> 00:48:26,248
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll be back after some murmur twins kicking it off.

682
00:49:12,253 --> 00:49:12,795
Thank you.

683
00:49:42,910 --> 00:49:44,155
Thanks for watching!

684
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:17,541
Thanks for watching!

685
00:54:19,608 --> 00:54:20,609
Thank you for watching

686
00:55:33,558 --> 00:55:39,361
[SPEAKER_02]: Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio because real radio makes Captain Jack cry

687
00:55:43,891 --> 00:55:44,532
[SPEAKER_06]: Orange Lounge Radio

688
00:56:06,512 --> 00:56:07,652
[SPEAKER_06]: Good times.

689
00:56:07,712 --> 00:56:08,312
[SPEAKER_06]: The old days.

690
00:56:08,372 --> 00:56:11,253
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the porno that was inspired by Dance Dance Revolution somehow.

691
00:56:11,333 --> 00:56:14,215
[SPEAKER_06]: When I say inspired by... Very loosely.

692
00:56:14,235 --> 00:56:16,235
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, like most of the girls in it.

693
00:56:17,236 --> 00:56:19,877
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I don't even think there was a part other than the title.

694
00:56:19,917 --> 00:56:20,717
[SPEAKER_06]: But they dance.

695
00:56:21,097 --> 00:56:29,140
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like Dance Dance Fuck Max something six or... Yeah, it was like Dance Dance Fuck Six or something.

696
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:29,921
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

697
00:56:29,961 --> 00:56:31,021
[SPEAKER_06]: Dance Dance Fuck Max.

698
00:56:31,061 --> 00:56:31,821
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember what it was.

699
00:56:32,162 --> 00:56:33,322
[SPEAKER_06]: That was years old though.

700
00:56:34,612 --> 00:56:57,574
[SPEAKER_06]: I always thought the porno that had the Final Fantasy X Final Fuck X That was the better one It was good cosplay Yeah, they had some good cosplayers in them And then they got naked and had sex But the Lulu actually had a little stuffed muggle Anyway Sorry kids

701
00:56:59,679 --> 00:57:01,681
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, by the way, children, don't listen to this program.

702
00:57:01,821 --> 00:57:02,161
[SPEAKER_06]: It's bad.

703
00:57:02,481 --> 00:57:02,862
[SPEAKER_06]: Bad for you.

704
00:57:03,142 --> 00:57:05,484
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I'm scared that I might have co-workers listening to this.

705
00:57:06,524 --> 00:57:11,228
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they all found out about the news thing that happened last Friday and some were asking, what's the web address?

706
00:57:11,248 --> 00:57:11,888
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the web address?

707
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:14,070
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, I don't care anymore.

708
00:57:14,570 --> 00:57:14,911
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't.

709
00:57:15,231 --> 00:57:16,692
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, I don't.

710
00:57:18,033 --> 00:57:19,214
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, it's not worth it.

711
00:57:19,474 --> 00:57:20,015
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not worth it.

712
00:57:20,035 --> 00:57:20,295
[SPEAKER_06]: I just,

713
00:57:20,868 --> 00:57:24,670
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, you keep it under wraps pretty good, which your weekend hobby is.

714
00:57:25,090 --> 00:57:25,550
[SPEAKER_14]: Hell no!

715
00:57:25,690 --> 00:57:27,091
[SPEAKER_14]: I tell everyone, hey, I'm on the radio!

716
00:57:27,291 --> 00:57:27,611
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

717
00:57:27,891 --> 00:57:30,092
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, listen to this, hey, look at this, because I don't really care.

718
00:57:30,272 --> 00:57:32,473
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not worried about them hearing you talk about Dance Dance Fuck?

719
00:57:32,773 --> 00:57:33,234
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

720
00:57:34,874 --> 00:57:36,055
[SPEAKER_14]: They've seen my cubicle.

721
00:57:37,636 --> 00:57:38,756
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, they know you're into porn.

722
00:57:38,816 --> 00:57:40,917
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I am not into porn, okay?

723
00:57:42,438 --> 00:57:45,059
[SPEAKER_14]: That was Loki's piece of crap.

724
00:57:46,923 --> 00:57:50,265
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, I was looking for quality Dance Dance Revolution products.

725
00:57:50,325 --> 00:57:53,166
[SPEAKER_05]: I came upon that and I was like, quality.

726
00:57:53,186 --> 00:57:55,528
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, I have to get that.

727
00:57:55,628 --> 00:57:59,630
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, I have the Happy Bunny magnet that you gave me in my cubicle.

728
00:57:59,990 --> 00:58:04,613
[SPEAKER_14]: With Happy Bunny pointing down to his crotch saying, I bet you love my thingy.

729
00:58:07,454 --> 00:58:10,776
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to be taking my other one there too that says, I love everybody except you assholes.

730
00:58:12,997 --> 00:58:13,637
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think I have...

731
00:58:16,399 --> 00:58:17,900
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you mentioned it a couple times.

732
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:25,242
[SPEAKER_06]: I like my job, but since I'm a presenter, I'm in front of people most of the time, I have to stay politically correct.

733
00:58:25,542 --> 00:58:26,943
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a very interesting challenge.

734
00:58:27,143 --> 00:58:44,388
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of my friends theorize that's why I do this program, is because I have to be so politically correct when I'm in front of a class teaching that this is my way of venting the other half of that, the unpolitically correct side of me, where I get to come on and say shit, piss, fuck, and people listen to that and laugh at it.

735
00:58:46,502 --> 00:58:48,804
[SPEAKER_06]: You mean they don't throw lawsuits our way?

736
00:58:49,505 --> 00:58:50,226
[SPEAKER_06]: Why is that?

737
00:58:50,826 --> 00:58:51,767
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we're on the interweb.

738
00:58:51,787 --> 00:58:53,128
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

739
00:58:53,969 --> 00:58:54,690
[SPEAKER_05]: No one likes the internet.

740
00:58:55,291 --> 00:58:59,094
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking of places you can't say shit, fuck, and cunt, there was...

741
00:59:00,131 --> 00:59:02,373
[SPEAKER_06]: All three of us need to try out a new co-host.

742
00:59:02,413 --> 00:59:05,835
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you know Loki on Attack of the Show would be hilarious.

743
00:59:05,855 --> 00:59:05,935
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

744
00:59:29,073 --> 00:59:30,714
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's come on the show drunk every day.

745
00:59:30,754 --> 00:59:31,995
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god, it's so much fun.

746
00:59:35,116 --> 00:59:36,157
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm seriously thinking about doing it.

747
00:59:36,477 --> 00:59:43,581
[SPEAKER_06]: My only issue is, though, since I'm going to be gone for two weeks, I have a feeling that that's when they're going to be here in San Francisco is when I'm gone, so I'm not going to be able to do it.

748
00:59:43,901 --> 00:59:48,923
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're going to miss out on a great candidate if I can't be there to do it.

749
00:59:49,864 --> 00:59:52,445
[SPEAKER_06]: So... I don't know.

750
00:59:52,465 --> 00:59:57,428
[SPEAKER_06]: They're just going to get some big breasted chick that doesn't know jack about technology done.

751
00:59:59,355 --> 01:00:03,177
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, I should apply.

752
01:00:03,397 --> 01:00:09,280
[SPEAKER_06]: You may have adequate boobage, but you actually know technology.

753
01:00:09,340 --> 01:00:11,961
[SPEAKER_06]: You have a bigger gaming collection than the two of us combined.

754
01:00:12,161 --> 01:00:15,723
[SPEAKER_14]: I have a bigger gaming collection than each of you combined.

755
01:00:16,564 --> 01:00:20,306
[SPEAKER_05]: Just grab one of the chicks off that stupid show, The Whipset, or whatever.

756
01:00:20,546 --> 01:00:24,648
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll go to the audition with my Turbo Express and my WonderSwan.

757
01:00:24,668 --> 01:00:25,228
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, here's the thing.

758
01:00:25,268 --> 01:00:33,552
[SPEAKER_06]: I was looking at the KevinPereira.com, which is the guy that's still the host on Attack of the Show, who, by the way, I like more and more as I see the show more and more.

759
01:00:33,612 --> 01:00:37,494
[SPEAKER_06]: When the screensavers first came out, I was kind of like, okay, this guy's a boob.

760
01:00:37,554 --> 01:00:38,035
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't like him.

761
01:00:38,495 --> 01:00:44,698
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm really warming up to him, and I think what they're trying to do with the show, he really does kind of fit it, and he's kind of funny.

762
01:00:45,058 --> 01:00:46,961
[SPEAKER_06]: and I think now that he's... Yeah, he'll have to go.

763
01:00:49,063 --> 01:00:55,250
[SPEAKER_06]: I think when it first started as the screensavers, I think it was always kind of trying to fit a square peg in a round hole kind of thing.

764
01:00:55,571 --> 01:01:01,257
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think he realizes this, so even if, you know, for some weird reason you heard me saying this, you wouldn't be offended because I think he realizes this.

765
01:01:01,478 --> 01:01:04,081
[SPEAKER_06]: Because even he says that first episode of the screensavers was bad.

766
01:01:05,083 --> 01:01:06,744
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

767
01:01:27,466 --> 01:01:30,987
[SPEAKER_06]: But we're not looking for someone that just is about the technology.

768
01:01:31,027 --> 01:01:33,868
[SPEAKER_06]: We're looking for someone that wants to be on TV talking about technology.

769
01:01:34,208 --> 01:01:36,449
[SPEAKER_06]: And for some reason, they're having a hard time finding that.

770
01:01:36,929 --> 01:01:37,569
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, DarkSakura?

771
01:01:38,310 --> 01:01:39,110
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm volunteering.

772
01:01:39,690 --> 01:01:40,750
[SPEAKER_06]: But wait a minute, though.

773
01:01:40,790 --> 01:01:44,071
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't want us to point the webcam at you, yet you would be on television?

774
01:01:45,692 --> 01:01:46,512
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd hire a trainer.

775
01:01:47,893 --> 01:01:48,413
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd do it.

776
01:01:49,333 --> 01:01:50,573
[SPEAKER_05]: I could talk about technology.

777
01:01:50,613 --> 01:01:51,914
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all I talk about.

778
01:01:52,234 --> 01:01:53,714
[SPEAKER_14]: You want to get me to lose weight?

779
01:01:53,734 --> 01:01:55,135
[SPEAKER_14]: Put me in a social situation.

780
01:01:56,684 --> 01:01:57,905
[SPEAKER_14]: Every freaking day.

781
01:01:58,585 --> 01:01:59,125
[SPEAKER_06]: I hear knocking.

782
01:01:59,145 --> 01:02:01,006
[SPEAKER_14]: I guarantee you I won't eat for a month.

783
01:02:01,666 --> 01:02:02,306
I hear knocking.

784
01:02:02,767 --> 01:02:06,208
[SPEAKER_14]: I hear cabinets is what I hear.

785
01:02:08,589 --> 01:02:09,389
[SPEAKER_05]: I heard knocking.

786
01:02:13,011 --> 01:02:13,471
[SPEAKER_05]: I could do it.

787
01:02:14,612 --> 01:02:14,852
[SPEAKER_05]: Easy.

788
01:02:16,392 --> 01:02:16,653
[SPEAKER_05]: Easy.

789
01:02:18,573 --> 01:02:19,174
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so much fun.

790
01:02:20,294 --> 01:02:20,574
[SPEAKER_14]: Is it?

791
01:02:20,894 --> 01:02:21,355
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it now?

792
01:02:21,575 --> 01:02:23,155
[SPEAKER_14]: You know it's tiny, but it's grown.

793
01:02:24,276 --> 01:02:24,496
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

794
01:02:27,113 --> 01:02:28,313
[SPEAKER_14]: Rob, you abandoned us.

795
01:02:28,373 --> 01:02:29,094
[SPEAKER_14]: How dare you?

796
01:02:29,114 --> 01:02:31,454
[SPEAKER_14]: 50 lashes with a chocolate whip.

797
01:02:33,155 --> 01:02:33,935
[SPEAKER_07]: To hell, Rob.

798
01:02:33,955 --> 01:02:36,336
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't go on an antagonist show because we need to do our show.

799
01:02:38,317 --> 01:02:43,498
[SPEAKER_06]: If somebody offered me money to do a live television show, I'd be all, screw you guys.

800
01:02:43,718 --> 01:02:44,599
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to L.A.

801
01:02:45,319 --> 01:02:45,879
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm just kidding.

802
01:02:45,919 --> 01:02:48,060
[SPEAKER_06]: I love you guys.

803
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:50,201
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd at least give you my two weeks.

804
01:02:50,261 --> 01:02:50,601
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on.

805
01:02:51,961 --> 01:02:52,461
[SPEAKER_06]: Bastard.

806
01:02:52,801 --> 01:02:53,522
[SPEAKER_14]: At that point...

807
01:02:55,455 --> 01:02:57,816
[SPEAKER_14]: At that point, you have a Menchie hat!

808
01:02:59,396 --> 01:02:59,656
[SPEAKER_14]: Give!

809
01:02:59,676 --> 01:03:02,336
[SPEAKER_14]: From Anime Expo, you want it?

810
01:03:02,536 --> 01:03:02,756
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

811
01:03:03,657 --> 01:03:04,777
[SPEAKER_14]: I have a Menchie hat.

812
01:03:06,837 --> 01:03:08,357
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, let's eat her!

813
01:03:08,577 --> 01:03:10,338
[SPEAKER_06]: She's the emergency food supply!

814
01:03:10,858 --> 01:03:12,218
[SPEAKER_14]: I have a Menchie hat.

815
01:03:12,478 --> 01:03:19,219
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, joining us, by the way, who hasn't been at this show in an awfully long time is the one and only Explicit, with three X's.

816
01:03:19,259 --> 01:03:20,059
[SPEAKER_13]: Our angry guy.

817
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:23,540
[SPEAKER_06]: Just what we need this show.

818
01:03:24,751 --> 01:03:25,991
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm not going to be angry this time.

819
01:03:26,011 --> 01:03:27,972
[SPEAKER_21]: I got some more important than that.

820
01:03:28,292 --> 01:03:29,492
[SPEAKER_21]: More important than just being angry.

821
01:03:29,873 --> 01:03:37,555
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, we were talking about TV earlier, and we were talking about Attack of the Show and how we're all going to be on it soon, because we want to do that.

822
01:03:39,636 --> 01:03:44,477
[SPEAKER_06]: Supposedly, some folks were emailing them, too, about us going on, so I don't know.

823
01:03:44,917 --> 01:03:47,818
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody contacted us, so I guess it wasn't enough people, so...

824
01:03:48,376 --> 01:03:52,539
[SPEAKER_06]: Go email them and tell them we're ready to whore ourselves out to be on cable.

825
01:03:52,719 --> 01:03:56,722
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we figure, okay, we've done the newspaper, we've done local TV, now we have to do basic cable.

826
01:03:57,083 --> 01:03:58,824
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the next step up.

827
01:03:58,984 --> 01:04:03,348
[SPEAKER_21]: So far, like, I'm in Canada, Tony and me got the spotlight right there.

828
01:04:03,508 --> 01:04:07,691
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I was going to say, what happened... Now, you also had a television experience recently.

829
01:04:07,751 --> 01:04:09,993
[SPEAKER_06]: We had Channel 3, but you had another station in town.

830
01:04:10,013 --> 01:04:10,913
[SPEAKER_06]: What was yours the thing about?

831
01:04:11,734 --> 01:04:12,715
[SPEAKER_21]: It was basically like...

832
01:04:13,215 --> 01:04:28,998
[SPEAKER_21]: The scenery of the DDR, and introducing the game to people for both perfect attack and freestyle, in addition to how this one person lost this much weight on DDR,

833
01:04:30,165 --> 01:04:32,347
[SPEAKER_06]: So they were kind of doing more of like a DDR story.

834
01:04:33,348 --> 01:04:43,677
[SPEAKER_06]: They were doing that typical Dance Dance Revolution in the news story where DDR, it's better than Grand Theft Auto because instead of making kids want to kill people, it makes them get up and exercise and want to lose weight.

835
01:04:44,378 --> 01:04:49,562
[SPEAKER_06]: But then, now the little piece I saw of it had Andrew dressed up like a pirate.

836
01:04:50,063 --> 01:04:50,883
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep, that's true.

837
01:04:51,103 --> 01:04:55,467
[SPEAKER_06]: And that other guy that's always with him dressed up as Darth Vader.

838
01:04:56,108 --> 01:04:56,848
[SPEAKER_21]: A different Andrew.

839
01:04:57,169 --> 01:04:57,369
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

840
01:04:58,140 --> 01:05:01,602
[SPEAKER_06]: And they were just, you know, being themselves, but on TV.

841
01:05:01,762 --> 01:05:03,582
[SPEAKER_21]: Or in the media, I guess.

842
01:05:04,023 --> 01:05:04,263
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

843
01:05:04,683 --> 01:05:06,464
[SPEAKER_06]: I would have totally gone if I didn't have to work.

844
01:05:06,904 --> 01:05:07,204
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

845
01:05:07,364 --> 01:05:09,125
[SPEAKER_21]: You would bring Orange Eyes Radio to the TV.

846
01:05:09,665 --> 01:05:13,207
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so we had to go get our own gig, since we couldn't go to yours.

847
01:05:13,687 --> 01:05:17,169
[SPEAKER_06]: I heard about Channel 3, so... We actually, we played the clip earlier, you missed it.

848
01:05:17,389 --> 01:05:18,549
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

849
01:05:18,889 --> 01:05:19,229
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, oh.

850
01:05:22,031 --> 01:05:24,272
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Loki, I'm so glad you suggested it here.

851
01:05:24,532 --> 01:05:26,093
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me get to the little piece here.

852
01:05:26,113 --> 01:05:26,813
[SPEAKER_06]: I found it.

853
01:05:27,878 --> 01:05:28,378
[SPEAKER_06]: What'd you find?

854
01:05:29,039 --> 01:05:29,779
[SPEAKER_06]: What'd you find, DarkSakura?

855
01:05:29,919 --> 01:05:31,920
[SPEAKER_14]: I found the Menchie hat, because I want one now.

856
01:05:34,221 --> 01:05:34,861
[SPEAKER_21]: You want that?

857
01:05:36,182 --> 01:05:36,462
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright.

858
01:05:36,902 --> 01:05:37,902
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, this is from Anime Expo.

859
01:05:37,922 --> 01:05:39,723
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm just giving away some stuff from Anime Expo.

860
01:05:39,803 --> 01:05:39,943
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay!

861
01:05:40,604 --> 01:05:41,804
[SPEAKER_14]: If you don't want the Menchie hat, sure!

862
01:05:42,304 --> 01:05:42,865
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, thanks.

863
01:05:43,125 --> 01:05:44,125
[SPEAKER_06]: This is just for you, Jonas.

864
01:05:44,165 --> 01:05:44,966
[SPEAKER_14]: Menchie hat!

865
01:05:45,106 --> 01:05:47,106
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, Loki, what did you think about being on television?

866
01:05:47,387 --> 01:05:48,367
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it's so much fun.

867
01:05:48,607 --> 01:05:49,007
[SPEAKER_05]: It's great.

868
01:05:50,328 --> 01:05:51,829
[SPEAKER_06]: That was Loki's big television debut.

869
01:05:52,269 --> 01:05:53,029
[SPEAKER_17]: That was it!

870
01:05:58,107 --> 01:05:58,728
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, wow.

871
01:06:00,449 --> 01:06:00,729
[SPEAKER_21]: Anyway.

872
01:06:01,089 --> 01:06:03,731
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, from what I heard from the taping, though.

873
01:06:04,132 --> 01:06:05,473
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki, you know what this is?

874
01:06:07,174 --> 01:06:09,175
[SPEAKER_14]: The world's smallest violin playing My Heart Bleeds For You.

875
01:06:10,576 --> 01:06:23,406
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, from what I've heard from the taping, like, the two Andrews were there, and some background people doing PA, and then me and Cam Canada doing a little freestyle to introduce it to the scenery.

876
01:06:24,321 --> 01:06:30,224
[SPEAKER_21]: And I'm not really sure if Scott Farah, the gaming guy of Channel 31 KMAX, introduced the tournament.

877
01:06:30,304 --> 01:06:33,386
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't even know we had a gaming guy on local television.

878
01:06:33,887 --> 01:06:34,907
[SPEAKER_21]: We had a gaming guy?

879
01:06:35,247 --> 01:06:37,929
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, his name is Scott Farah on the morning show.

880
01:06:38,409 --> 01:06:39,470
[SPEAKER_21]: Usually he's there on Mondays.

881
01:06:40,210 --> 01:06:40,791
[SPEAKER_06]: On the guy.

882
01:06:41,251 --> 01:06:42,031
[SPEAKER_06]: The gaming guy.

883
01:06:42,512 --> 01:06:43,432
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that his job?

884
01:06:43,472 --> 01:06:45,873
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that strictly his job is to be the gaming guy?

885
01:06:46,214 --> 01:06:48,115
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, I want to be the gaming guy!

886
01:06:49,429 --> 01:06:49,949
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm cute.

887
01:06:50,289 --> 01:06:51,149
[SPEAKER_06]: I can be on TV.

888
01:06:51,189 --> 01:06:54,070
[SPEAKER_21]: You're going to be there on the tournament if you're still interested in going on the 30th.

889
01:06:54,170 --> 01:06:59,731
[SPEAKER_06]: I might, except I have a flight leaving the very next day, so I'm going to try and make it.

890
01:06:59,751 --> 01:07:02,852
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell us, plug your tournament, plug your tourney thing that you're doing.

891
01:07:03,452 --> 01:07:09,734
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, we had one tournament, they won the tournament already on yesterday for the initial D section.

892
01:07:10,074 --> 01:07:10,374
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah?

893
01:07:10,914 --> 01:07:11,354
[SPEAKER_21]: How'd that go?

894
01:07:11,594 --> 01:07:18,096
[SPEAKER_21]: It turned out pretty okay, so-so in certain ways, because we had some problems with someone's card didn't read it.

895
01:07:18,536 --> 01:07:18,736
[SPEAKER_18]: Mm-hmm.

896
01:07:19,246 --> 01:07:22,989
[SPEAKER_21]: But then again, they said the car was bent, so I don't know what happened.

897
01:07:24,070 --> 01:07:25,171
[SPEAKER_21]: It was eight competitors.

898
01:07:25,251 --> 01:07:28,234
[SPEAKER_21]: The first place winner was some guy named Jay.

899
01:07:29,115 --> 01:07:32,958
[SPEAKER_21]: Second place was T, and third was Kenshin.

900
01:07:33,899 --> 01:07:35,480
[SPEAKER_14]: Jonas, you know what you and I need to do?

901
01:07:36,121 --> 01:07:37,082
[SPEAKER_14]: We need to work on Shaft 2.

902
01:07:38,695 --> 01:07:39,055
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh yes.

903
01:07:41,357 --> 01:07:43,878
[SPEAKER_21]: But we're going to post it though, so far.

904
01:07:44,378 --> 01:07:45,019
[SPEAKER_21]: What's your plans?

905
01:07:45,059 --> 01:07:47,080
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, but I need to, we need to talk.

906
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:53,744
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I've been needing to get Shaft to run for a while and they've been kind of being assholes at RVGL.

907
01:07:54,424 --> 01:07:57,646
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, that's what I don't do with RVGL.

908
01:07:57,746 --> 01:07:59,868
[SPEAKER_21]: Their management with tournaments, no.

909
01:08:01,088 --> 01:08:05,671
[SPEAKER_14]: This facility would be great, otherwise I don't want to deal with what's-his-face.

910
01:08:06,806 --> 01:08:12,928
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's funny, because their management also put repairing their machines as no, and listening to the customers as no.

911
01:08:13,789 --> 01:08:15,389
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really ironic the way that works.

912
01:08:15,449 --> 01:08:16,470
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

913
01:08:16,490 --> 01:08:17,370
[SPEAKER_21]: Are you serious?

914
01:08:19,391 --> 01:08:22,832
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, first of all, RV Chill's a business, so... We'll ask you in the chat room.

915
01:08:22,972 --> 01:08:23,993
[SPEAKER_14]: Hold the microphone a little bit back.

916
01:08:24,233 --> 01:08:24,473
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

917
01:08:24,573 --> 01:08:29,355
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is funny, because Jonas actually doesn't hold his microphone that close to his mouth.

918
01:08:29,395 --> 01:08:31,015
[SPEAKER_06]: He's just got that kind of voice, kids.

919
01:08:31,496 --> 01:08:32,036
[SPEAKER_21]: But that's all right.

920
01:08:32,356 --> 01:08:32,596
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean...

921
01:08:33,223 --> 01:08:37,205
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's see, I don't know why RBGL doesn't want a tournament, because I've done this before myself.

922
01:08:38,325 --> 01:08:46,228
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, that's where FU was supposed to be held, but then I decided to do PI because that's the only place that would host a tournament.

923
01:08:48,169 --> 01:08:51,890
[SPEAKER_21]: Scandia, they want to do their own gig.

924
01:08:52,010 --> 01:08:53,671
[SPEAKER_21]: Of course, you've been to one of their tournaments.

925
01:08:54,995 --> 01:08:56,676
[SPEAKER_06]: I did go to one of those Scandia tournaments.

926
01:08:56,716 --> 01:08:57,216
[SPEAKER_06]: It was okay.

927
01:08:57,256 --> 01:08:57,736
[SPEAKER_06]: It was cute.

928
01:08:58,496 --> 01:09:00,637
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't like a large-scale DDR tournament.

929
01:09:00,657 --> 01:09:03,578
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't the kind of thing you should drive in from San Francisco for, but it was cute.

930
01:09:03,998 --> 01:09:04,458
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I know.

931
01:09:05,238 --> 01:09:06,439
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

932
01:09:06,499 --> 01:09:10,660
[SPEAKER_21]: First off, Jamie, first I'll take care of the tournament that's happening this Saturday.

933
01:09:11,100 --> 01:09:12,401
[SPEAKER_21]: Then we'll talk about Shaft 2.

934
01:09:13,501 --> 01:09:15,622
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I meant Shaft 2 because I've got to deal with school starting.

935
01:09:16,082 --> 01:09:18,403
[SPEAKER_14]: Once I get in my school schedule, I'll have more time to plot to that.

936
01:09:18,703 --> 01:09:19,263
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.

937
01:09:19,283 --> 01:09:21,524
[SPEAKER_21]: Just give me a call anytime and reply and we'll see what's up.

938
01:09:22,632 --> 01:09:25,734
[SPEAKER_21]: So many people want to help out with the whole tournament issues.

939
01:09:26,014 --> 01:09:35,259
[SPEAKER_14]: And Shaft had such a good turnout, and it ended up being one of the big ones when it was out, that I think that, you know, putting the name on it would give us a big draw-in.

940
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:36,240
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see what happens.

941
01:09:36,420 --> 01:09:38,962
[SPEAKER_14]: We got a few people, we got a couple of the Yamaha people.

942
01:09:39,382 --> 01:09:40,382
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I remember that, that was pretty cool.

943
01:09:41,023 --> 01:09:41,943
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a good time.

944
01:09:42,163 --> 01:09:44,925
[SPEAKER_06]: And the 2DX tournament, too, was cool, except we won't be having that again.

945
01:09:44,945 --> 01:09:45,726
[SPEAKER_21]: Wasn't that Marsh Brandes, though?

946
01:09:46,206 --> 01:09:47,086
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, we did it at Shaft, too.

947
01:09:47,106 --> 01:09:47,747
[SPEAKER_21]: That was at Shaft.

948
01:09:47,907 --> 01:09:48,947
[SPEAKER_06]: We did both, it was both.

949
01:09:49,428 --> 01:09:50,088
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

950
01:09:51,209 --> 01:09:51,469
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway...

951
01:09:52,536 --> 01:09:58,401
[SPEAKER_06]: What we're going to do now, I was going to talk about the MidiHead thing, so let me get into that.

952
01:10:00,543 --> 01:10:06,827
[SPEAKER_06]: MidiHead, our buddy that had a song over in Ultramix 2, he did, you know, the In My Eyes remix was in Ultramix 2, remember that?

953
01:10:07,608 --> 01:10:11,371
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty good song there, very well liked, fan favorite.

954
01:10:11,611 --> 01:10:13,373
[SPEAKER_06]: He's back, he's going to be in...

955
01:10:15,126 --> 01:10:15,907
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

956
01:10:43,397 --> 01:10:45,878
[SPEAKER_06]: What MidiHead did is he kind of put this whole show together.

957
01:10:45,918 --> 01:10:51,039
[SPEAKER_06]: He engineered this 30-minute show where he plays his track from Ultramix 2.

958
01:10:51,439 --> 01:10:55,660
[SPEAKER_06]: He played the Wraith song from his upcoming album.

959
01:10:56,021 --> 01:10:59,041
[SPEAKER_06]: He played... What else did he play?

960
01:10:59,081 --> 01:11:00,822
[SPEAKER_06]: He played Raise Your Hands.

961
01:11:00,902 --> 01:11:02,522
[SPEAKER_06]: He played Take Me Away From Here.

962
01:11:02,982 --> 01:11:04,543
[SPEAKER_06]: And then he plays the new...

963
01:11:05,430 --> 01:11:05,871
[SPEAKER_06]: Jellykiss

964
01:11:34,886 --> 01:11:36,848
So it sounds pretty cool.

965
01:11:55,612 --> 01:11:57,273
[SPEAKER_06]: It sounds like it's going to be a fun little remix there.

966
01:11:57,613 --> 01:12:03,294
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember playing it at E3, and I loved the remix of Jelly Kiss, so it was probably my favorite thing.

967
01:12:03,615 --> 01:12:04,615
[SPEAKER_14]: I actually tried to play it.

968
01:12:05,655 --> 01:12:06,636
[SPEAKER_06]: What did you think of the song?

969
01:12:07,056 --> 01:12:09,356
[SPEAKER_14]: My hip ended up being a screaming nightmare of agony.

970
01:12:11,217 --> 01:12:12,397
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's not because of the song.

971
01:12:13,238 --> 01:12:13,978
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I liked the song.

972
01:12:13,998 --> 01:12:14,678
[SPEAKER_14]: I wish I could have played it.

973
01:12:14,698 --> 01:12:17,539
[SPEAKER_14]: I only got halfway through it before my hip gave out on me.

974
01:12:19,003 --> 01:12:23,145
[SPEAKER_06]: Check that out on DDRFreak.com You can just download the MP3 right there.

975
01:12:23,165 --> 01:12:28,908
[SPEAKER_06]: Which, by the way, I think would probably be the only time I've ever seen a Bomani-related MP3 so blatantly on DDRFreak.

976
01:12:29,268 --> 01:12:30,648
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's kind of a historical thing as well.

977
01:12:30,668 --> 01:12:31,128
[SPEAKER_06]: So check that out.

978
01:12:31,208 --> 01:12:31,389
[SPEAKER_06]: It's nice.

979
01:12:46,764 --> 01:12:54,387
[SPEAKER_06]: Bimani Style isn't hosting the file per se, but they ran an article on it, and so did DDRUK.

980
01:12:54,688 --> 01:13:00,890
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's thanks to one of our listeners, actually, who is mod on all those sites.

981
01:13:02,591 --> 01:13:03,571
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, check that out.

982
01:13:04,312 --> 01:13:04,952
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a good time.

983
01:13:06,058 --> 01:13:07,519
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a good podcast.

984
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:12,984
[SPEAKER_06]: The thing about MiniHead, too, is he does these funny radio voiceovers during the whole thing, too.

985
01:13:13,044 --> 01:13:15,026
[SPEAKER_06]: He's just like, this is MiniHead!

986
01:13:15,206 --> 01:13:17,167
[SPEAKER_06]: He's just going crazy during the whole thing.

987
01:13:18,168 --> 01:13:19,870
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you got a shout-out on the thing.

988
01:13:20,450 --> 01:13:21,311
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't get a shout-out.

989
01:13:21,351 --> 01:13:22,192
[SPEAKER_06]: Jamie didn't get a shout-out.

990
01:13:22,212 --> 01:13:22,932
[SPEAKER_06]: You got a shout-out.

991
01:13:23,513 --> 01:13:24,153
[SPEAKER_06]: Your mic's not on.

992
01:13:25,194 --> 01:13:27,516
[SPEAKER_06]: Damn straight, because the mic needs to be on.

993
01:13:28,177 --> 01:13:28,777
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I'm awesome.

994
01:13:30,859 --> 01:13:31,860
[SPEAKER_05]: And I hang out on his forums.

995
01:13:32,594 --> 01:13:35,977
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you just get it because you have to shout out because you hang out on the forums.

996
01:13:35,997 --> 01:13:39,220
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what it is, basically, what it boils down to.

997
01:13:40,321 --> 01:13:42,282
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Loki, what did you think of the Middy Head podcast?

998
01:13:42,302 --> 01:13:42,963
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so much fun.

999
01:13:43,183 --> 01:13:43,964
[SPEAKER_06]: It's great.

1000
01:13:48,527 --> 01:13:51,150
[SPEAKER_06]: Not as much fun as this McDonald's barbecue sauce.

1001
01:13:52,628 --> 01:13:57,794
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, since you guys are eating... By the way, MidiHead also teases the fact that there's a third song he's going to have in the game.

1002
01:13:58,034 --> 01:14:02,960
[SPEAKER_06]: He pretty much all but says, I have a third song in Ultramix 3, but he's teasing us.

1003
01:14:03,020 --> 01:14:04,301
[SPEAKER_06]: He's not telling us what that song is.

1004
01:14:04,542 --> 01:14:12,691
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're assuming that the reason why you might want to subscribe to the podcast and not just download the direct file, unless you're lazy and don't want to set up podcasting...

1005
01:14:13,892 --> 01:14:22,595
[SPEAKER_06]: You probably want to subscribe to the podcast because whenever this third song is announced he will probably do a podcast part two and that's going to be the first place you're going to hear this new song.

1006
01:14:24,516 --> 01:14:28,938
[SPEAKER_06]: So he pretty much all but said he's going to have a third song in the game so we're kind of interested to see what that is.

1007
01:14:30,089 --> 01:14:36,631
[SPEAKER_06]: But you notice that they've kind of in general been very, very quiet about these recent DDR games.

1008
01:14:36,911 --> 01:14:39,232
[SPEAKER_06]: Like they haven't been doing the clues.

1009
01:14:39,692 --> 01:14:44,013
[SPEAKER_06]: They usually do the clues around this time where people try to guess what the songs are that are going to be in the game.

1010
01:14:44,393 --> 01:14:46,514
[SPEAKER_06]: They haven't been saying a whole lot about the features.

1011
01:14:46,794 --> 01:14:51,135
[SPEAKER_06]: We've really gotten not a lot since E3 besides this MIDI head thing.

1012
01:14:51,315 --> 01:14:51,715
[SPEAKER_06]: Not a problem.

1013
01:14:51,735 --> 01:14:56,057
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll send another demo for GamePro to review and boom!

1014
01:14:56,097 --> 01:14:56,597
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

1015
01:14:56,617 --> 01:14:57,177
[SPEAKER_06]: There's everything.

1016
01:14:58,047 --> 01:15:00,708
[SPEAKER_06]: Why do you think that is, that they're being so tight-lipped about it this time?

1017
01:15:00,968 --> 01:15:01,828
[SPEAKER_06]: Because GamePro sucks?

1018
01:15:02,088 --> 01:15:03,108
[SPEAKER_06]: No, not GamePro.

1019
01:15:03,148 --> 01:15:04,348
[SPEAKER_06]: It has nothing to do with GamePro.

1020
01:15:04,368 --> 01:15:09,349
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm talking about, in general, Konami's lack of playing around on the forums.

1021
01:15:09,729 --> 01:15:14,851
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, some of the Konami reps are playing on DDR Freak, and they chime in once in a while.

1022
01:15:15,471 --> 01:15:23,432
[SPEAKER_06]: Even Miklatov, who's been on the show a couple times, he's jumped in there, but you notice that when Miklatov has been on the show, he hasn't said anything.

1023
01:15:23,472 --> 01:15:26,293
[SPEAKER_06]: Not nearly what he was telling us this time last year.

1024
01:15:27,086 --> 01:15:32,792
[SPEAKER_06]: On the show, he's not saying a whole lot about the new games.

1025
01:15:33,493 --> 01:15:38,017
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they're doing some weird things with the releases coming out.

1026
01:15:39,178 --> 01:15:42,021
[SPEAKER_05]: Good things, but weird things.

1027
01:15:42,442 --> 01:15:48,247
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm thinking they're probably just going to keep it in the wrap so when it comes out and people go, Oh, wow!

1028
01:15:48,488 --> 01:15:50,189
[SPEAKER_05]: Instead of, Ah, it sounds like crap.

1029
01:15:50,229 --> 01:15:50,830
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they don't buy it.

1030
01:15:51,499 --> 01:15:53,440
[SPEAKER_05]: So, it's more of a shock factor.

1031
01:15:53,701 --> 01:15:54,962
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't really have to give hints.

1032
01:15:55,022 --> 01:15:55,282
[SPEAKER_05]: Why?

1033
01:15:55,362 --> 01:15:57,944
[SPEAKER_05]: No other companies give hints about what their games are going to be like.

1034
01:15:58,524 --> 01:15:59,165
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck it, wait.

1035
01:15:59,785 --> 01:16:00,245
[SPEAKER_05]: Be patient.

1036
01:16:00,385 --> 01:16:03,508
[SPEAKER_06]: Rockstar's on their forums going, hey guys, did you know you can unlock a sex game?

1037
01:16:05,849 --> 01:16:06,210
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

1038
01:16:06,270 --> 01:16:16,117
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there was an E3 strategy that worked very well for them, and that is that they didn't say shit about Beatmania USA until E3 itself.

1039
01:16:16,197 --> 01:16:17,818
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a very, very quiet thing.

1040
01:16:18,138 --> 01:16:20,420
[SPEAKER_06]: They had said, oh yeah, we're going to have, you know,

1041
01:16:20,842 --> 01:16:23,306
[SPEAKER_06]: Extreme 2 and DDR Ultimix 3 and all that stuff.

1042
01:16:23,346 --> 01:16:28,333
[SPEAKER_06]: But they didn't say anything about... They didn't say anything about Beatmania.

1043
01:16:29,403 --> 01:16:35,469
[SPEAKER_06]: Because if they had said something about Beatmania, people were going to come up with all these preconceived notions about what they wanted in Beatmania.

1044
01:16:35,750 --> 01:16:38,272
[SPEAKER_06]: And when that wasn't met, they were going to be disappointed.

1045
01:16:38,773 --> 01:16:41,015
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a feeling it's a similar thing they're doing here.

1046
01:16:41,295 --> 01:16:49,383
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not saying anything about the games, because if they do, people are just going to go, Why isn't this feature in the game?

1047
01:16:49,704 --> 01:16:51,285
[SPEAKER_06]: Why didn't they put this song in?

1048
01:16:52,987 --> 01:17:05,934
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they're just trying to avoid that this time because it seems like that's what happens when they tell us the song list is people go, although there are the people that are appreciative of the hints and that deserve to know these things in advance, there's just a few bad apples that ruin it for everyone.

1049
01:17:05,954 --> 01:17:12,017
[SPEAKER_06]: The people that get on there and go, why don't we get this song and why haven't we gotten Cartoon Heroes and DDR yet?

1050
01:17:12,717 --> 01:17:17,780
[SPEAKER_05]: Wasn't Genie in a Bottle in DDR Extreme 2?

1051
01:17:17,820 --> 01:17:22,642
[SPEAKER_05]: They had something like Christina Aguilera's song or something like that.

1052
01:17:23,246 --> 01:17:23,446
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

1053
01:17:25,648 --> 01:17:27,709
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they got, like, Britney, I think, in there, too.

1054
01:17:27,729 --> 01:17:30,751
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1055
01:17:30,831 --> 01:17:34,233
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm actually interested to hear those again.

1056
01:17:35,113 --> 01:17:35,434
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1057
01:17:35,654 --> 01:17:36,895
[SPEAKER_06]: They weren't in the E3 thing, though.

1058
01:17:36,935 --> 01:17:38,496
[SPEAKER_06]: It was just a preview.

1059
01:17:38,516 --> 01:17:39,236
[SPEAKER_06]: They had a clip.

1060
01:17:39,256 --> 01:17:39,996
[SPEAKER_06]: They had a thing.

1061
01:17:40,016 --> 01:17:46,440
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a clip of the Genie in the Bottle thing that was on some video of somebody from E3 or something.

1062
01:17:46,460 --> 01:17:46,781
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

1063
01:17:46,901 --> 01:17:50,423
[SPEAKER_06]: No, they did have Genie in the Bottle in the E3 demo, but it was so freaking loud you couldn't hear it.

1064
01:17:50,748 --> 01:17:56,650
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right, and I thought that they mentioned something about Oops I Did It Again, too, being in there.

1065
01:17:57,090 --> 01:18:00,992
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I remember after that, people were like, Oh, long versions are coming back!

1066
01:18:01,052 --> 01:18:03,312
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're like, no.

1067
01:18:03,573 --> 01:18:10,975
[SPEAKER_06]: Oops wasn't in there, but I think it's kind of assumed that it's going to be a different cut of Oops I Did It Again.

1068
01:18:12,416 --> 01:18:13,256
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, anyway.

1069
01:18:14,212 --> 01:18:26,138
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just kind of reading what's going on in the chat room, and I think some people are kind of agreeing with the same thing, that, you know, people are basically... Konami isn't wanting to deal with the obnoxious people that whine about everything they release, and all that other stuff going on there.

1070
01:18:29,379 --> 01:18:30,760
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, let's see.

1071
01:18:31,400 --> 01:18:34,201
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought the E3 build of Beatmania was just a throw together.

1072
01:18:35,742 --> 01:18:39,524
[SPEAKER_06]: I think in some ways it was, because some things weren't enabled in there, but I think...

1073
01:18:40,788 --> 01:18:43,549
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's going to be what they're going in the direction towards.

1074
01:18:43,589 --> 01:18:48,252
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it is going to be basically a night style redone for us with different songs.

1075
01:18:48,592 --> 01:18:52,414
[SPEAKER_06]: And the whole five key songs and five key mode, which I think is pretty cool.

1076
01:18:52,674 --> 01:18:58,197
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if it was necessarily thrown together because that five key song and five key mode probably took a little extra programming.

1077
01:18:58,257 --> 01:18:59,397
[SPEAKER_06]: It's supposed to be thrown together.

1078
01:18:59,437 --> 01:19:00,378
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what a beta is.

1079
01:19:00,698 --> 01:19:07,223
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they wanted to show what they were going to do, but not, I mean, obviously they probably haven't made a lot of progress on the game because they're working on the DDRs.

1080
01:19:07,343 --> 01:19:10,845
[SPEAKER_06]: You kind of wonder with these fans, oh, what, I expect the full game to be done.

1081
01:19:11,005 --> 01:19:11,826
[SPEAKER_05]: No, you idiot.

1082
01:19:11,886 --> 01:19:13,547
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not going to have the full game done.

1083
01:19:13,587 --> 01:19:15,168
[SPEAKER_05]: It's obviously a work in progress.

1084
01:19:15,709 --> 01:19:18,251
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, they're just showing off what they have.

1085
01:19:18,311 --> 01:19:21,653
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why they have the E3 version.

1086
01:19:21,833 --> 01:19:28,998
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, people are like, oh, the full game's going to suck because it doesn't have 7 key and wine.

1087
01:19:29,559 --> 01:19:30,079
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know,

1088
01:19:32,102 --> 01:19:35,423
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, what we're going to do now, I guess we're going to go to a break.

1089
01:19:35,463 --> 01:19:38,164
[SPEAKER_06]: When we come back from break, we'll take your calls on Skype.

1090
01:19:38,204 --> 01:19:40,746
[SPEAKER_06]: I promise that we do the Skype thing this break, but we didn't get around to it.

1091
01:19:41,206 --> 01:19:44,007
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll take your calls on Skype when we come back from this next break.

1092
01:19:44,647 --> 01:19:49,870
[SPEAKER_06]: And we will also do the cage match tonight, because I keep promising we're going to get into that as well.

1093
01:19:50,490 --> 01:19:52,131
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's start off this break with...

1094
01:19:53,274 --> 01:19:55,396
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we'll do some home version song here.

1095
01:19:55,717 --> 01:19:56,578
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, you know what I feel like?

1096
01:19:56,618 --> 01:19:58,540
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like playing that one Love is Orange mix.

1097
01:19:58,600 --> 01:20:01,643
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a little bit longer of a song, but I think we're going to fit it in here, because I feel like playing that.

1098
01:20:01,663 --> 01:20:08,591
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're going to play that, and we'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio and the Cage Match and your calls on the Skype line after this.

1099
01:21:47,934 --> 01:21:48,814
[SPEAKER_17]: Thanks for watching!

1100
01:22:28,769 --> 01:22:29,689
Thank you for watching!

1101
01:23:11,201 --> 01:23:11,782
DarkSakura

1102
01:23:56,693 --> 01:23:57,336
Thanks for watching!

1103
01:24:22,485 --> 01:24:23,446
Thank you for watching!

1104
01:25:05,590 --> 01:25:06,313
Thanks for watching!

1105
01:25:36,714 --> 01:25:37,801
Thanks for watching!

1106
01:26:49,301 --> 01:26:50,421
Thanks for watching!

1107
01:27:25,427 --> 01:27:30,969
[SPEAKER_24]: Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song, Orange Lounge Radio.

1108
01:27:32,030 --> 01:27:34,611
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi kids, we're back with more Orange Lounge Radio here.

1109
01:27:34,631 --> 01:27:41,794
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to get into the cage match somewhat shortly, but we also wanted to start taking your calls on the Skype line.

1110
01:27:41,874 --> 01:27:44,756
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you want to call us, head on over to the Skype line.

1111
01:27:44,816 --> 01:27:54,840
[SPEAKER_06]: It's www.orangeloungeradio.com and just click on interact with us and it has all the information that you need to call us and talk live with us.

1112
01:27:55,598 --> 01:28:00,702
[SPEAKER_06]: And so while we have that open up, I don't see a whole lot of people signed in.

1113
01:28:00,742 --> 01:28:01,602
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe we'll get a couple calls.

1114
01:28:01,622 --> 01:28:01,922
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

1115
01:28:04,324 --> 01:28:06,906
[SPEAKER_06]: But meanwhile, I want to remind you guys about something.

1116
01:28:07,726 --> 01:28:08,847
[SPEAKER_06]: Podcast Awards.

1117
01:28:09,087 --> 01:28:11,909
[SPEAKER_06]: We were nominated in the recent Podcast Awards.

1118
01:28:12,389 --> 01:28:13,590
[SPEAKER_06]: So you should vote for us.

1119
01:28:13,670 --> 01:28:20,395
[SPEAKER_06]: Head on over to www.podcastawards.com and make sure that you vote for us once every day.

1120
01:28:21,823 --> 01:28:22,744
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening, everyone.

1121
01:28:22,764 --> 01:28:23,004
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening.

1122
01:28:23,024 --> 01:28:23,444
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you?

1123
01:28:23,524 --> 01:28:23,805
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm fine.

1124
01:28:52,014 --> 01:28:56,397
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, just, you know, just some off-topic stuff.

1125
01:28:56,617 --> 01:29:00,959
[SPEAKER_20]: I got some 2DX, you know, Happy Sky, some entering stuff about Happy Sky.

1126
01:29:01,259 --> 01:29:02,640
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh, what's going on with Happy Sky?

1127
01:29:02,980 --> 01:29:04,941
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to get to those MP3s you sent me later, too.

1128
01:29:05,021 --> 01:29:05,682
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't forgotten.

1129
01:29:05,722 --> 01:29:07,143
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to save it for later.

1130
01:29:08,683 --> 01:29:10,404
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, you can play a small clip if you want.

1131
01:29:10,805 --> 01:29:13,026
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm just going to announce some hidden songs.

1132
01:29:13,502 --> 01:29:14,623
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless they're upgraded to a new 2DX mix.

1133
01:29:35,259 --> 01:29:37,761
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, we have a little clip of that one here.

1134
01:30:07,350 --> 01:30:08,010
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, cool.

1135
01:30:09,950 --> 01:30:10,591
[SPEAKER_20]: Let me check.

1136
01:30:11,111 --> 01:30:13,791
[SPEAKER_20]: It's by Hoshino Kanako, and it's Get Cold.

1137
01:30:14,811 --> 01:30:16,432
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that this one that doesn't have a label on it?

1138
01:30:16,472 --> 01:30:16,992
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that this one?

1139
01:30:20,332 --> 01:30:21,693
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, that's not Get Cold.

1140
01:30:21,853 --> 01:30:22,693
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, uh-oh.

1141
01:30:22,813 --> 01:30:23,813
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know which one that was then.

1142
01:30:24,813 --> 01:30:25,553
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe I don't have that one.

1143
01:30:27,033 --> 01:30:28,354
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you know which one that was I just played?

1144
01:30:29,014 --> 01:30:29,554
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, never mind.

1145
01:30:30,614 --> 01:30:32,895
[SPEAKER_20]: I'll just say the next song.

1146
01:30:32,935 --> 01:30:34,815
[SPEAKER_20]: It's Plasma by...

1147
01:30:40,828 --> 01:30:42,709
[SPEAKER_06]: Soda Fujimori did Plasma, yes?

1148
01:30:43,249 --> 01:30:45,390
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, here's a clip of Plasma.

1149
01:30:52,452 --> 01:30:53,732
[SPEAKER_06]: This one sounds kind of cool, okay.

1150
01:30:54,452 --> 01:30:57,913
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of sounds like every other Soda Fujimori song, but that's alright.

1151
01:30:57,973 --> 01:31:03,175
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if I have that one.

1152
01:31:03,255 --> 01:31:04,075
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you send me everything?

1153
01:31:06,215 --> 01:31:09,017
[SPEAKER_20]: I have... I forgot to send you... Oh, okay.

1154
01:31:09,117 --> 01:31:09,377
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1155
01:31:11,079 --> 01:31:15,122
[SPEAKER_20]: And then the last one is... This is going to be a very complicated to say.

1156
01:31:17,163 --> 01:31:17,824
[SPEAKER_20]: It's by Ginger.

1157
01:31:17,904 --> 01:31:22,507
[SPEAKER_20]: It's called... That sounds like it should have a long, complicated name.

1158
01:31:22,527 --> 01:31:23,928
That's kind of interesting.

1159
01:31:23,969 --> 01:31:24,089
Okay.

1160
01:31:32,955 --> 01:31:34,576
[SPEAKER_20]: This one's translated into English.

1161
01:31:36,097 --> 01:31:38,538
[SPEAKER_20]: I just translated it on some site.

1162
01:31:39,139 --> 01:31:40,239
[SPEAKER_20]: And it says, What?

1163
01:31:40,319 --> 01:31:42,521
[SPEAKER_20]: That's what it's translated.

1164
01:31:42,761 --> 01:31:42,981
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

1165
01:31:43,801 --> 01:31:45,983
[SPEAKER_20]: What the hell?

1166
01:31:46,003 --> 01:31:46,123
[SPEAKER_20]: Weird.

1167
01:31:51,817 --> 01:31:58,461
[SPEAKER_20]: And here's some stuff about Hidden Plus and Sudden Plus.

1168
01:31:58,501 --> 01:31:59,481
[SPEAKER_20]: Here's something interesting.

1169
01:32:02,423 --> 01:32:14,851
[SPEAKER_20]: On Hidden Plus and Sudden Plus, you can actually change the width of the cover not only before the song begins, but also during gameplay by holding the start button and adjusting it with the turntable.

1170
01:32:16,789 --> 01:32:17,049
[SPEAKER_06]: Weird.

1171
01:32:17,209 --> 01:32:21,311
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can actually adjust the windows that you're hiding or, you know, either way.

1172
01:32:21,371 --> 01:32:22,091
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of neat.

1173
01:32:22,251 --> 01:32:23,392
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

1174
01:32:23,652 --> 01:32:23,892
[SPEAKER_06]: Huh.

1175
01:32:23,912 --> 01:32:27,114
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, not only before the song starts, but during gameplay.

1176
01:32:27,934 --> 01:32:28,974
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, that's kind of cool.

1177
01:32:29,095 --> 01:32:29,495
[SPEAKER_06]: I like that.

1178
01:32:29,775 --> 01:32:40,199
[SPEAKER_06]: So, like, if you decide that, oh, a little too much on the sudden thing, or maybe I put it on accidentally, then I could just use the start button to, like, take it off by rolling it so much that it would just not be there.

1179
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:40,920
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of neat.

1180
01:32:41,060 --> 01:32:41,220
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

1181
01:32:42,185 --> 01:32:51,068
[SPEAKER_20]: And then there's already a new way of accessing the extra stage, which is Scream Squad by Cap.

1182
01:32:52,188 --> 01:32:58,950
[SPEAKER_20]: And the way you do it is, on the first and second stage, you have to double A in another of any level with hard mode.

1183
01:33:00,351 --> 01:33:03,432
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, so you can get the extra stage that way just by double A-ing in another on hard.

1184
01:33:05,052 --> 01:33:05,732
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm not done yet.

1185
01:33:06,252 --> 01:33:07,413
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, okay.

1186
01:33:07,733 --> 01:33:10,854
[SPEAKER_20]: On the final stage, you have to double A a level 10 or higher...

1187
01:33:11,883 --> 01:33:15,645
[SPEAKER_20]: either in hyper or another with hard mode, no random, no mirror.

1188
01:33:17,265 --> 01:33:19,346
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's to get the one more extra stage?

1189
01:33:20,687 --> 01:33:22,828
[SPEAKER_20]: No, that's how you get the extra stage.

1190
01:33:23,028 --> 01:33:23,388
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

1191
01:33:23,508 --> 01:33:25,889
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, dang, so they just raised the bar on that, basically.

1192
01:33:25,909 --> 01:33:26,510
[SPEAKER_06]: More complicated, yeah.

1193
01:33:26,670 --> 01:33:27,570
[SPEAKER_20]: Wow.

1194
01:33:27,930 --> 01:33:36,594
[SPEAKER_20]: Usually on the previous 2DX styles, like until 2DX Red, you just double level 8 another with hard mode.

1195
01:33:36,994 --> 01:33:37,335
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

1196
01:33:37,395 --> 01:33:40,256
[SPEAKER_20]: That's the simplest way, but now they made it more complicated.

1197
01:33:40,714 --> 01:33:41,335
[SPEAKER_06]: Disco Yotsu Uchi Inochi

1198
01:34:10,188 --> 01:34:11,568
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, thank you for issuing that correction.

1199
01:34:11,608 --> 01:34:12,689
[SPEAKER_06]: That was very honest of you.

1200
01:34:12,709 --> 01:34:14,769
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish the regular media could be that way.

1201
01:34:14,809 --> 01:34:20,110
[SPEAKER_20]: Anything else you want to share with us about the 2DX world?

1202
01:34:20,210 --> 01:34:20,531
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, just

1203
01:34:39,219 --> 01:34:47,727
[SPEAKER_20]: Just to name some artists.

1204
01:34:47,988 --> 01:34:51,551
[SPEAKER_20]: I'll just name the artists that have songs.

1205
01:34:51,751 --> 01:34:54,734
[SPEAKER_20]: Don't Let It Go by Uchis, Uchida Brothers.

1206
01:34:57,296 --> 01:34:59,759
[SPEAKER_20]: And then there's, what do you call it?

1207
01:35:01,320 --> 01:35:04,103
[SPEAKER_20]: Spark by Silver Fox Productions featuring Hoshino Kanako.

1208
01:35:07,213 --> 01:35:11,394
[SPEAKER_20]: Under the Sky by Minami Sayaka from B4U with Platonix.

1209
01:35:13,375 --> 01:35:13,795
[SPEAKER_20]: What else?

1210
01:35:14,335 --> 01:35:18,496
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, there's Happy Angel by Jun Fichin Takirik or Tahiri.

1211
01:35:19,677 --> 01:35:24,678
[SPEAKER_20]: And these are more songs that are in Happy Sky, yes?

1212
01:35:25,118 --> 01:35:28,940
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, the ones that have Japanese characters that you might not understand.

1213
01:35:28,960 --> 01:35:30,220
[SPEAKER_06]: Gotcha, okay, okay.

1214
01:35:30,320 --> 01:35:32,621
[SPEAKER_20]: And then there's Garden by Aokiriye.

1215
01:35:33,368 --> 01:35:37,290
[SPEAKER_20]: I'll just type them after this call.

1216
01:35:37,550 --> 01:35:38,150
[SPEAKER_06]: Works for me.

1217
01:35:39,190 --> 01:35:45,313
[SPEAKER_20]: Whenever there are song titles, just point me out and I'll type them in.

1218
01:35:45,693 --> 01:35:46,173
[SPEAKER_20]: Sounds good.

1219
01:35:47,474 --> 01:35:47,674
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1220
01:35:48,074 --> 01:35:48,474
[SPEAKER_06]: Alrighty.

1221
01:35:48,614 --> 01:35:49,794
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, thanks for the call, Siggy.

1222
01:35:49,814 --> 01:35:50,435
[SPEAKER_06]: We appreciate it.

1223
01:35:51,255 --> 01:35:51,535
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

1224
01:35:51,735 --> 01:35:52,235
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a good one.

1225
01:35:52,255 --> 01:35:53,096
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

1226
01:35:53,156 --> 01:35:53,396
[SPEAKER_06]: Later.

1227
01:35:53,496 --> 01:35:53,756
[SPEAKER_06]: Later.

1228
01:35:54,807 --> 01:35:56,888
[SPEAKER_06]: What's our resident 2DX whore, Siggy?

1229
01:35:57,088 --> 01:35:57,769
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay whore!

1230
01:35:57,829 --> 01:36:00,831
[SPEAKER_06]: Calling us.

1231
01:36:01,331 --> 01:36:06,034
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to load the It's So Much Fun clip again, but I think we've really run out of the ground.

1232
01:36:07,655 --> 01:36:07,875
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

1233
01:36:08,795 --> 01:36:09,756
[SPEAKER_05]: What's so much fun?

1234
01:36:10,416 --> 01:36:11,517
[SPEAKER_05]: Playing the clip over and over?

1235
01:36:11,577 --> 01:36:12,298
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that so much fun?

1236
01:36:12,318 --> 01:36:13,278
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, actually it is.

1237
01:36:13,298 --> 01:36:13,999
[SPEAKER_06]: Tons of fun.

1238
01:36:14,279 --> 01:36:18,741
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody said they were going to make a ytmnd.com site out of that.

1239
01:36:19,502 --> 01:36:20,923
[SPEAKER_06]: You know that's the site where...

1240
01:36:21,992 --> 01:36:24,874
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, the one I think of is the con one.

1241
01:36:25,515 --> 01:36:26,195
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you seen that site?

1242
01:36:27,116 --> 01:36:28,758
[SPEAKER_06]: It just repeats that file over and over.

1243
01:36:28,818 --> 01:36:29,658
[SPEAKER_06]: Con!

1244
01:36:29,959 --> 01:36:30,679
[SPEAKER_17]: Con!

1245
01:36:30,719 --> 01:36:34,002
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's the background is the, you know, William Shatner going, ah!

1246
01:36:34,682 --> 01:36:35,563
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody was going to make a site.

1247
01:36:35,583 --> 01:36:40,927
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know how, like, now they have this site where you can build your own YTMND site?

1248
01:36:42,389 --> 01:36:45,251
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody's going to build one of those for you going, oh, it's so much fun.

1249
01:36:45,411 --> 01:36:46,031
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it's so much fun.

1250
01:36:46,092 --> 01:36:46,672
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be hilarious.

1251
01:36:46,732 --> 01:36:48,013
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, we got another call on Skype.

1252
01:36:48,033 --> 01:36:48,814
[SPEAKER_06]: That sounds like a winner.

1253
01:36:49,434 --> 01:36:50,375
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1254
01:36:51,229 --> 01:36:56,313
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, but I have to do a little rant here about the whole hot coffee thing.

1255
01:36:56,333 --> 01:36:58,035
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to introduce yourself first.

1256
01:36:58,615 --> 01:36:59,196
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm Reznor.

1257
01:36:59,816 --> 01:37:00,317
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, Reznor.

1258
01:37:00,357 --> 01:37:01,298
[SPEAKER_06]: Reznor calls us quite a bit.

1259
01:37:01,338 --> 01:37:02,018
[SPEAKER_06]: The resident drunk.

1260
01:37:03,319 --> 01:37:04,340
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, we like that.

1261
01:37:04,440 --> 01:37:07,303
[SPEAKER_06]: I was the resident drunk last night, but I'm okay now.

1262
01:37:08,284 --> 01:37:18,913
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, but the whole media finding... The media is basically behind the times on anything that relates to anything related with a computer or a video game.

1263
01:37:19,582 --> 01:37:21,063
[SPEAKER_08]: Ooh, hot shit.

1264
01:37:21,123 --> 01:37:22,624
[SPEAKER_08]: There's sex in a video game.

1265
01:37:22,684 --> 01:37:23,625
[SPEAKER_08]: We can't have this.

1266
01:37:23,945 --> 01:37:30,350
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's fine and alright to have people doing drive-bys and shooting people and ripping off heads.

1267
01:37:30,430 --> 01:37:33,652
[SPEAKER_08]: Violence is quite alright, but doing somebody in the ass isn't.

1268
01:37:34,335 --> 01:37:38,496
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, this just goes back to what is acceptable in R-rated movies as well.

1269
01:37:38,536 --> 01:37:46,097
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, remember the whole stink with that movie Eyes Wide Shut where, oh no, they're going to show some titties and some penises and it's going to be NC-17.

1270
01:37:46,478 --> 01:37:54,599
[SPEAKER_06]: But meanwhile, the latest like Terminator 3 where they just blow shit up left and right is, you know, just a relatively mild R. Exactly.

1271
01:37:54,759 --> 01:38:03,241
[SPEAKER_08]: Case in point of horrendous violence being completely accepted would be Dead Alive where in a movie this guy is fighting zombies with a...

1272
01:38:04,079 --> 01:38:08,181
[SPEAKER_08]: Freaking Lawnmower strapped to his chest and he runs up to him and chops him in half.

1273
01:38:08,521 --> 01:38:17,825
[SPEAKER_08]: Not to mention the fact that he is also de-birthed by his demon mother, sucked right into her vagina and then pulled right the hell back out.

1274
01:38:18,145 --> 01:38:19,585
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god, I have this movie.

1275
01:38:19,625 --> 01:38:20,726
[SPEAKER_08]: I need to watch it now.

1276
01:38:21,406 --> 01:38:21,846
[SPEAKER_14]: Sweet.

1277
01:38:22,066 --> 01:38:23,107
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, okay, okay.

1278
01:38:23,327 --> 01:38:24,287
[SPEAKER_14]: This inspires me.

1279
01:38:24,307 --> 01:38:25,508
[SPEAKER_14]: Zombie movie night at my house.

1280
01:38:27,109 --> 01:38:29,049
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, let's not segue into zombies.

1281
01:38:29,089 --> 01:38:30,910
[SPEAKER_14]: Dead Alive and Wild Hero.

1282
01:38:31,290 --> 01:38:32,631
[SPEAKER_06]: Reznor wants to finish his thought.

1283
01:38:32,771 --> 01:38:32,991
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1284
01:38:34,077 --> 01:38:38,681
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, but the media are complete idiots when it comes to anything technological.

1285
01:38:39,661 --> 01:38:40,182
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything.

1286
01:38:41,263 --> 01:38:43,404
[SPEAKER_08]: The story on podcasting.

1287
01:38:43,504 --> 01:38:44,425
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, it's so fun.

1288
01:38:45,206 --> 01:38:48,528
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just had a local story in the local news.

1289
01:38:48,628 --> 01:39:03,119
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, kids are attending these new parties called LAN parties, where they come together for 24 hours of caffeine-fueled fun, playing very violent games and swapping files back and forth.

1290
01:39:03,639 --> 01:39:06,461
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, we've been doing this crap since what, 1995?

1291
01:39:06,741 --> 01:39:09,982
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just now reaching the media?

1292
01:39:10,342 --> 01:39:13,564
[SPEAKER_08]: Pull your collective heads out of your asses for a change!

1293
01:39:14,024 --> 01:39:14,885
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god!

1294
01:39:15,025 --> 01:39:21,008
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember the LAN forum, because that's the only way you could play like Doom 2 multiplayer was to do the LAN thing.

1295
01:39:21,708 --> 01:39:23,749
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, doing dial-up and then have phone calls like $500.

1296
01:39:23,889 --> 01:39:27,711
[SPEAKER_14]: I remember playing 11-player Duke Nukem 3D on a LAN.

1297
01:39:27,891 --> 01:39:29,232
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, that's right, Duke Nukem is another one.

1298
01:39:29,552 --> 01:39:29,772
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway.

1299
01:39:31,336 --> 01:39:34,238
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, but the media are just such whores.

1300
01:39:34,298 --> 01:39:41,964
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd like to round, as I said in the chat room, I'd like to round them all up in a pit and reenact the scene from HUD where they're shooting the cattle.

1301
01:39:42,924 --> 01:39:44,466
[SPEAKER_08]: It's such bullshit.

1302
01:39:46,407 --> 01:39:53,612
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what amazes me about this whole thing is that Grand Theft Auto is a bit of a scapegoat because it's not like we have never had sex before.

1303
01:39:54,093 --> 01:39:56,876
[SPEAKER_06]: or very, very sexual things in games before.

1304
01:39:57,257 --> 01:39:59,559
[SPEAKER_06]: This could go all the way back to Custer's Revenge.

1305
01:39:59,619 --> 01:40:09,710
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, granted, Custer's Revenge was not a runaway sales hit, shall we say, and neither was Night Trap, even though that game didn't have sex in it.

1306
01:40:10,011 --> 01:40:12,894
[SPEAKER_06]: But God of War has a sex minigame in it.

1307
01:40:13,494 --> 01:40:20,296
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the only reason that they're scapegoating Grand Theft Auto is because it's been in the spotlight before.

1308
01:40:20,696 --> 01:40:29,058
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm surprised they didn't start whipping out Doom 3 and just saying, oh, there's demonology and rituals and there's blood all over the place.

1309
01:40:29,199 --> 01:40:30,639
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's okay because that's blood.

1310
01:40:31,394 --> 01:40:45,484
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly, but they're only scapegoating GTA because it was in the spotlight before, and they just want to rile up the collection of Bible-thumping parents out there and say, ooh, look, there's titties and a money shot.

1311
01:40:45,564 --> 01:40:50,227
[SPEAKER_08]: Ignore the fact that the game says the F word and nigger half the time.

1312
01:40:51,047 --> 01:41:02,132
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, no, it's great, though, too, is, like I predicted, this is only the beginning, it's the whole nipple gate all over again, and as we'll be covering in our podcast later, they're coming after Sims 2's nude patch now.

1313
01:41:03,233 --> 01:41:06,614
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah, you're saying that it's appealing to pedophiles.

1314
01:41:06,634 --> 01:41:07,635
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a huge difference.

1315
01:41:07,655 --> 01:41:11,137
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, Newsflash, there are Ken dolls underneath those blurs.

1316
01:41:12,817 --> 01:41:14,218
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a huge difference.

1317
01:41:15,536 --> 01:41:18,122
[SPEAKER_08]: Not on the patch that I have!

1318
01:41:18,402 --> 01:41:21,469
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a huge difference, too, between the Sims 2 thing and the Grand Theft Auto thing.

1319
01:41:21,529 --> 01:41:26,339
[SPEAKER_06]: As I pointed out earlier, I believe the Grand Theft Auto thing to be a case of lazy programming.

1320
01:41:26,676 --> 01:41:27,817
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1321
01:41:48,120 --> 01:41:49,241
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1322
01:42:11,440 --> 01:42:15,581
[SPEAKER_06]: That they break it down into second grade language for these people so that they understand.

1323
01:42:15,881 --> 01:42:17,422
[SPEAKER_06]: And draw pictures if you have to.

1324
01:42:17,742 --> 01:42:24,104
[SPEAKER_06]: To understand the difference between what happened with Grand Theft Auto San Andreas and people outright making the nude patches for other games.

1325
01:42:24,324 --> 01:42:31,787
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, God, within like five seconds of the Tomb Raider game being out, somebody had a patch so you could see Lara Croft's pussy.

1326
01:42:32,047 --> 01:42:32,647
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's just...

1327
01:42:33,707 --> 01:42:49,470
[SPEAKER_08]: I still think that our society is so fucked up that where you can rip somebody's head off with the spine attached, dangling with blood dripping off of it, it's considered alright, but a money shot of man goo in the face of a woman on her knees is so taboo.

1328
01:42:49,750 --> 01:43:01,332
[SPEAKER_06]: But, to put it into perspective though, the spinal cord attached to the head thing, and I assume you're referencing Mortal Kombat, I seem to recall that did have this whole theory of the attention with it.

1329
01:43:01,992 --> 01:43:03,354
[SPEAKER_14]: That's why it wasn't in the Super Nintendo.

1330
01:43:03,374 --> 01:43:04,795
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically what it's basically boiling down to is

1331
01:43:23,777 --> 01:43:24,578
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.com

1332
01:44:02,304 --> 01:44:04,426
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll bet you anything here's what happens about this.

1333
01:44:04,506 --> 01:44:09,552
[SPEAKER_06]: Because parents are lazy and can't figure out how to do these things themselves, remember what they had to do for televisions?

1334
01:44:09,612 --> 01:44:13,216
[SPEAKER_06]: That it's mandatory that the V-chip be installed in all television sets?

1335
01:44:13,536 --> 01:44:19,578
[SPEAKER_06]: So that you can block programs above a certain rating if you want to.

1336
01:44:19,859 --> 01:44:23,380
[SPEAKER_06]: So that way parents could still leave their kids unattended and the TV does the babysitting for them.

1337
01:44:23,620 --> 01:44:27,141
[SPEAKER_08]: The only problem with that is the parents are half stupid about it.

1338
01:44:27,161 --> 01:44:29,402
[SPEAKER_08]: They can't even work the VCR half the time.

1339
01:44:29,422 --> 01:44:31,523
[SPEAKER_08]: The kids have already figured a way to hack around the VCR.

1340
01:44:32,023 --> 01:44:33,444
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to disagree with you there.

1341
01:44:34,644 --> 01:44:41,127
[SPEAKER_06]: But I bet you anything, as a result of this, it's going to be required in these next-gen systems that they do some similar type of...

1342
01:44:41,727 --> 01:44:42,868
[SPEAKER_06]: This is really crazy.

1343
01:44:43,068 --> 01:44:44,469
[SPEAKER_07]: They already have that!

1344
01:44:44,789 --> 01:44:46,490
[SPEAKER_07]: It's already in the PlayStation 2.

1345
01:44:47,210 --> 01:44:48,331
[SPEAKER_07]: It's already on the PSP.

1346
01:44:48,391 --> 01:44:49,291
[SPEAKER_07]: It's already on the Xbox.

1347
01:44:49,312 --> 01:44:50,512
[SPEAKER_07]: They're pre-programmed in there.

1348
01:44:50,732 --> 01:44:51,193
[SPEAKER_07]: But guess what?

1349
01:44:51,453 --> 01:44:52,273
[SPEAKER_07]: Nobody knows about it.

1350
01:44:52,313 --> 01:44:56,035
[SPEAKER_07]: Because they're not responsible parents.

1351
01:44:56,556 --> 01:45:01,919
[SPEAKER_07]: Even if this game is adults only, kids are still going to be playing it because their dumbass parents go and buy it for them.

1352
01:45:02,219 --> 01:45:03,380
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I hope happens?

1353
01:45:04,100 --> 01:45:04,921
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's what I hope happens.

1354
01:45:05,181 --> 01:45:06,502
[SPEAKER_07]: The game gets rated adults only.

1355
01:45:07,242 --> 01:45:08,963
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck it, let's do whatever the fuck we want.

1356
01:45:09,163 --> 01:45:14,864
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to have it where the main character goes and rapes babies and sends people on fire.

1357
01:45:15,225 --> 01:45:15,865
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck it, you know what?

1358
01:45:15,945 --> 01:45:18,406
[SPEAKER_07]: I can do it now because it is an adults-only game.

1359
01:45:18,926 --> 01:45:21,486
[SPEAKER_07]: So fuck you, can't say shit, adults-only.

1360
01:45:22,007 --> 01:45:26,048
[SPEAKER_14]: You just make a game that says, fuck your children, this is adults-only.

1361
01:45:26,708 --> 01:45:40,736
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to be able to ride around in a car that has a collective of child heads lined up on the front of the car for the grill, and I also have a rocket launcher that fires chickens butt-first out of it towards little old ladies that are carrying groceries.

1362
01:45:41,036 --> 01:45:46,500
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you happen to knock one old lady into another, and her head gets stuck up her butt, you get a bonus score.

1363
01:45:48,321 --> 01:45:48,581
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

1364
01:45:51,329 --> 01:45:56,893
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the problem though with the AO, you know, we're going to have this adults only orgy of games now.

1365
01:45:57,354 --> 01:46:08,702
[SPEAKER_06]: The thing is, is that the targets, not really the targets, but they're part of it, the Walmarts of the world, the Best Buys of the world, the GameStops and... Oh, don't even get me started on stupid fucking Walmarts.

1366
01:46:09,523 --> 01:46:15,087
[SPEAKER_06]: All these stores, all the big stores are going to pull, they're not going to have these games because they're the equivalent of porn.

1367
01:46:15,387 --> 01:46:21,813
[SPEAKER_06]: So the only way you're ever going to find these AO games is in the back room of some video clearance center, rundown shack.

1368
01:46:21,833 --> 01:46:23,554
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, time for the mom and pops to come back.

1369
01:46:23,594 --> 01:46:28,539
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what, if these big store chains don't want to carry the hot games out there, people will go other places and find them.

1370
01:46:29,339 --> 01:46:30,380
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what the internet's for.

1371
01:46:31,021 --> 01:46:32,042
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a wired world out there.

1372
01:46:32,062 --> 01:46:32,362
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

1373
01:46:32,462 --> 01:46:33,303
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck Walmart.

1374
01:46:33,323 --> 01:46:33,703
[SPEAKER_14]: Who cares?

1375
01:46:33,803 --> 01:46:35,305
[SPEAKER_14]: No one buys games anymore anyways.

1376
01:46:35,325 --> 01:46:36,366
[SPEAKER_14]: They're always pirating them off the internet.

1377
01:46:36,386 --> 01:46:38,748
[SPEAKER_14]: You can probably end up buying them out of vending machines in Japan.

1378
01:46:39,625 --> 01:46:45,710
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I want to buy an adults-only game right next to being able to buy beer and sweaty girls' panties.

1379
01:46:49,273 --> 01:46:50,253
[SPEAKER_08]: Shit, I'm out of beer.

1380
01:46:53,636 --> 01:46:55,978
[SPEAKER_06]: Reznor, can't say we necessarily disagree with you.

1381
01:46:56,058 --> 01:47:07,707
[SPEAKER_06]: You bring an interesting perspective to it, and I'll tell you what, you should be a game designer, because I think the Rabing Grandma game or whatever you had going on here was pretty hot, and I'd buy it.

1382
01:47:08,231 --> 01:47:13,598
[SPEAKER_08]: Raping Grandma's 3, now with the new raccoon tail power-up.

1383
01:47:14,139 --> 01:47:15,381
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the Grandma game.

1384
01:47:15,401 --> 01:47:20,007
[SPEAKER_08]: Because you can fuck Grandma across the Oregon Trail.

1385
01:47:21,509 --> 01:47:24,533
[SPEAKER_06]: You just wanted to work in the words Oregon Trail into this show, didn't you?

1386
01:47:25,493 --> 01:47:26,534
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, not really.

1387
01:47:26,694 --> 01:47:32,560
[SPEAKER_14]: Someone has pointed out to me that the game that you're talking about sounds a lot like Death Race 2000.

1388
01:47:33,961 --> 01:47:39,666
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, yes, it does.

1389
01:47:39,886 --> 01:47:44,631
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you imagine the grandma game, though, where they've got, you know, oh, here's grandma number one.

1390
01:47:44,711 --> 01:47:45,832
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Maude.

1391
01:47:46,873 --> 01:47:48,695
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, Grandma Maude, answer this question.

1392
01:47:48,715 --> 01:47:49,856
[SPEAKER_06]: You've got to flash your titties.

1393
01:47:51,181 --> 01:47:55,803
[SPEAKER_08]: Whoa, whoa, okay, that's one instance I agree against porn.

1394
01:47:56,503 --> 01:48:02,206
[SPEAKER_14]: You say Maude, and I think of Bea Arthur now, so that's scary, because she had that show.

1395
01:48:03,526 --> 01:48:07,107
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you have the movie Airheads, it's like, I want naked pictures of Bea Arthur.

1396
01:48:07,468 --> 01:48:08,448
[SPEAKER_06]: No you don't, no you don't.

1397
01:48:09,709 --> 01:48:15,751
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, all kidding aside, you bring up some good points, Reznor, and I hope America's listening.

1398
01:48:18,030 --> 01:48:19,071
[SPEAKER_08]: Long live USA.

1399
01:48:20,533 --> 01:48:22,975
[SPEAKER_06]: Any other final thoughts for us?

1400
01:48:23,055 --> 01:48:24,317
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'll save it for the FU.

1401
01:48:24,617 --> 01:48:25,157
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds good to me.

1402
01:48:25,358 --> 01:48:26,359
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for being a friend.

1403
01:48:27,239 --> 01:48:28,441
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a good one.

1404
01:48:28,921 --> 01:48:29,301
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye.

1405
01:48:30,002 --> 01:48:31,644
[SPEAKER_14]: You're the kind of listener we encourage.

1406
01:48:31,664 --> 01:48:32,565
[SPEAKER_14]: One more call.

1407
01:48:32,605 --> 01:48:34,126
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1408
01:48:40,692 --> 01:48:41,973
[SPEAKER_22]: Loki for president, please.

1409
01:48:42,193 --> 01:48:43,715
[SPEAKER_22]: I nominate Loki for president.

1410
01:48:43,815 --> 01:48:44,836
[SPEAKER_22]: That was just awesome.

1411
01:48:45,156 --> 01:48:45,877
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, come on.

1412
01:48:45,917 --> 01:48:47,678
[SPEAKER_06]: His ego doesn't need any more of that, please.

1413
01:48:48,319 --> 01:48:49,400
[SPEAKER_22]: Hey, you can be vice president.

1414
01:48:49,420 --> 01:48:50,801
[SPEAKER_22]: DarkSakura can be the first lady.

1415
01:48:52,642 --> 01:48:54,724
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I'm the meat dictator.

1416
01:48:56,226 --> 01:48:57,327
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm the Illuminati!

1417
01:48:57,867 --> 01:49:03,072
[SPEAKER_06]: Jamie would be evil dictator of the country that would start World War III with Loki's country.

1418
01:49:03,112 --> 01:49:04,593
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of how it would work, so...

1419
01:49:05,410 --> 01:49:12,236
[SPEAKER_22]: Right now I want her and Hillary Clinton in a ring, three minutes, no polls barred, no TQ match.

1420
01:49:12,356 --> 01:49:13,196
[SPEAKER_22]: That's what I want.

1421
01:49:13,216 --> 01:49:15,378
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd be taking out the brass knucks and breaking her face.

1422
01:49:16,359 --> 01:49:16,859
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

1423
01:49:17,500 --> 01:49:20,803
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad this is uncensored radio because we could get in an AO right now.

1424
01:49:21,123 --> 01:49:22,304
[SPEAKER_06]: Bitch, no you didn't.

1425
01:49:24,005 --> 01:49:24,926
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck that bullshit.

1426
01:49:24,946 --> 01:49:25,827
[SPEAKER_22]: Just bring it on.

1427
01:49:29,730 --> 01:49:31,771
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to say, I was going to run that clip again.

1428
01:49:31,811 --> 01:49:33,713
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, what do you think about running for president?

1429
01:49:33,793 --> 01:49:34,474
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it's so fun.

1430
01:49:35,700 --> 01:49:37,861
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm too lazy to queue up the clip again.

1431
01:49:39,022 --> 01:49:40,382
[SPEAKER_06]: So what else is on your mind, my friend?

1432
01:49:41,863 --> 01:49:47,766
[SPEAKER_22]: This is Ranchan, by the way, and a lot of crazy things have been happening to me the last couple of days, last two, three days.

1433
01:49:49,567 --> 01:49:50,967
[SPEAKER_06]: Like what kinds of crazy things?

1434
01:49:51,207 --> 01:49:54,749
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't forget it.

1435
01:49:54,789 --> 01:49:56,550
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to make a sitcom reference or something.

1436
01:49:56,570 --> 01:49:56,870
[SPEAKER_06]: Forget it.

1437
01:49:57,931 --> 01:49:58,851
[SPEAKER_06]: What kinds of crazy things?

1438
01:50:00,049 --> 01:50:03,150
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's say I order a package for a friend of mine for a birthday gift.

1439
01:50:03,230 --> 01:50:05,191
[SPEAKER_22]: It shows up the day after the party.

1440
01:50:06,991 --> 01:50:09,672
[SPEAKER_22]: My family just went into utter turmoil right now.

1441
01:50:09,912 --> 01:50:10,992
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

1442
01:50:11,933 --> 01:50:13,553
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, you don't know.

1443
01:50:13,693 --> 01:50:14,973
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll probably PM you that later.

1444
01:50:16,234 --> 01:50:20,255
[SPEAKER_22]: On the good side, I just found out there's going to be an anime con in Sacramento this weekend.

1445
01:50:21,215 --> 01:50:24,916
[SPEAKER_06]: I heard about some anime con that's going to be at the mall or something.

1446
01:50:24,936 --> 01:50:25,437
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, goody.

1447
01:50:25,637 --> 01:50:26,477
[SPEAKER_06]: Not that one again.

1448
01:50:27,188 --> 01:50:29,550
[SPEAKER_22]: I sent Jamie the information already.

1449
01:50:29,730 --> 01:50:30,151
[SPEAKER_22]: You know what?

1450
01:50:30,171 --> 01:50:32,193
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember the last time?

1451
01:50:32,213 --> 01:50:36,036
[SPEAKER_14]: I have saw the email and then I got bombarded, so... Sorry.

1452
01:50:36,757 --> 01:50:36,997
[SPEAKER_06]: It's okay.

1453
01:50:37,017 --> 01:50:39,960
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember the last time we went to that thing?

1454
01:50:40,560 --> 01:50:43,503
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm afraid of anime cons in a mall.

1455
01:50:45,839 --> 01:50:46,580
[SPEAKER_06]: It was okay.

1456
01:50:46,640 --> 01:50:49,523
[SPEAKER_06]: It was basically a bunch of vendors getting together to sell shit.

1457
01:50:49,603 --> 01:50:50,684
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it was okay.

1458
01:50:50,824 --> 01:50:52,145
[SPEAKER_14]: The typical Sunrise Fest.

1459
01:50:52,185 --> 01:50:57,590
[SPEAKER_06]: The video room was the old McDonald's that is converted into like every store possible.

1460
01:50:57,610 --> 01:50:59,012
[SPEAKER_06]: That was pretty funny, I have to admit.

1461
01:51:00,032 --> 01:51:02,294
[SPEAKER_22]: Anime Cons of the Mall, I got you beat.

1462
01:51:02,794 --> 01:51:07,378
[SPEAKER_22]: My anime cosplay club had like a little picnic in Central Park last weekend.

1463
01:51:08,459 --> 01:51:12,102
[SPEAKER_22]: We came across another cosplaying group known as the Naruto Crack Crew.

1464
01:51:12,522 --> 01:51:17,346
[SPEAKER_22]: They came in full Naruto cosplay gear and we're just staring at them.

1465
01:51:18,467 --> 01:51:19,568
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, that's awesome.

1466
01:51:20,569 --> 01:51:24,051
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, I wore my forehead protector and that was it.

1467
01:51:24,472 --> 01:51:27,314
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, no more Naruto cards, please.

1468
01:51:27,554 --> 01:51:27,974
God, no.

1469
01:51:29,747 --> 01:51:30,027
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

1470
01:51:30,328 --> 01:51:32,810
[SPEAKER_06]: Um... We might go check out the con.

1471
01:51:32,870 --> 01:51:44,261
[SPEAKER_06]: My only problem is that I'm actually flying out to the East Coast on Sunday, which I think is the day that the majority of the con is taking place, so I don't know if I personally can go, but maybe my esteemed co-presenters can go.

1472
01:51:44,461 --> 01:51:44,822
[SPEAKER_06]: Go where?

1473
01:51:45,042 --> 01:51:45,723
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll think about it.

1474
01:51:46,063 --> 01:51:46,443
[SPEAKER_06]: The, um...

1475
01:51:49,035 --> 01:51:50,715
[SPEAKER_06]: Go hand out flyers for our show or something.

1476
01:51:50,735 --> 01:51:51,456
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll go buy a pretzel.

1477
01:51:51,956 --> 01:51:52,916
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I like their pretzel.

1478
01:51:52,936 --> 01:51:53,537
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

1479
01:51:53,657 --> 01:51:54,137
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

1480
01:51:54,697 --> 01:51:56,578
[SPEAKER_22]: Get me a box of tofu.

1481
01:51:56,678 --> 01:51:58,399
[SPEAKER_22]: Are you still meeting me when I come out to the East Coast?

1482
01:51:58,899 --> 01:52:02,040
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, a few of my friends are going to get together after the tournament.

1483
01:52:02,080 --> 01:52:03,401
[SPEAKER_22]: We want to drag you off to a diner.

1484
01:52:04,121 --> 01:52:04,662
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds good to me.

1485
01:52:05,382 --> 01:52:05,582
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

1486
01:52:05,899 --> 01:52:08,560
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, as long as I'm back at a decent hour, because I do have to work the next day.

1487
01:52:08,600 --> 01:52:09,681
[SPEAKER_06]: But yes, I can do that.

1488
01:52:09,701 --> 01:52:10,441
[SPEAKER_22]: It's the whole problem.

1489
01:52:10,862 --> 01:52:11,122
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1490
01:52:11,582 --> 01:52:13,363
[SPEAKER_22]: We'll keep the alcohol to a minimum, okay?

1491
01:52:13,503 --> 01:52:15,384
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds good to me, because I have a low tolerance.

1492
01:52:15,884 --> 01:52:16,144
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1493
01:52:16,304 --> 01:52:16,645
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent.

1494
01:52:16,785 --> 01:52:17,945
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything else you want to share with us today?

1495
01:52:19,746 --> 01:52:22,988
[SPEAKER_22]: Can I get a request of Let's Groove, my tips and tricks, please?

1496
01:52:23,368 --> 01:52:24,709
[SPEAKER_06]: I will try and work it in a little later.

1497
01:52:25,549 --> 01:52:25,829
[SPEAKER_22]: Sweet.

1498
01:52:25,849 --> 01:52:27,290
[SPEAKER_06]: Send me a private message so I don't forget.

1499
01:52:27,950 --> 01:52:28,211
[SPEAKER_22]: I will.

1500
01:52:28,351 --> 01:52:28,651
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1501
01:52:29,471 --> 01:52:30,112
[SPEAKER_06]: Later, my friend.

1502
01:52:30,552 --> 01:52:30,972
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye-bye.

1503
01:52:32,515 --> 01:52:34,978
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, good calls tonight, boys and girls.

1504
01:52:35,098 --> 01:52:37,861
[SPEAKER_06]: We appreciate... We like our intelligent listeners.

1505
01:52:37,901 --> 01:52:40,564
[SPEAKER_06]: This is what really motivates us to do what we do here.

1506
01:52:41,525 --> 01:52:44,508
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, and now something that takes no intelligence whatsoever.

1507
01:52:44,548 --> 01:52:46,270
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match.

1508
01:52:48,880 --> 01:52:52,082
[SPEAKER_06]: In tonight's cage match, three songs will do battle.

1509
01:52:52,302 --> 01:52:53,283
[SPEAKER_06]: Whoops, where'd Hollick go?

1510
01:52:53,483 --> 01:52:53,824
[SPEAKER_06]: There we go.

1511
01:52:54,304 --> 01:52:56,465
[SPEAKER_06]: Three songs will do battle in tonight's cage match.

1512
01:52:56,525 --> 01:52:59,347
[SPEAKER_06]: Last week's winner, you get a clip of it, two brand new songs.

1513
01:52:59,888 --> 01:53:05,652
[SPEAKER_06]: Your votes in the chat room at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, clicking on chat, will determine the winner.

1514
01:53:05,952 --> 01:53:10,896
[SPEAKER_06]: And the winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio Live, Milani Music and more programs.

1515
01:53:11,604 --> 01:53:24,628
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, first up we get last week's winner, last week in the Orange Lounge Cage Match, a very interesting spin on a 70s classic one, and it was kind of one of those moments where DarkSakura and I went, huh?

1516
01:53:25,168 --> 01:53:34,911
[SPEAKER_06]: But you guys voted for it, you voted for Loki's pick of Ozzy Osbourne with Stayin' Alive, so it comes back as song number one this week, here's a clip, Ozzy Osbourne, Stayin' Alive.

1517
01:53:47,509 --> 01:53:48,210
Thank you for watching!

1518
01:54:07,128 --> 01:54:08,189
[SPEAKER_17]: Stayin' Alive!

1519
01:54:08,209 --> 01:54:08,730
Stayin' Alive!

1520
01:54:33,085 --> 01:54:48,832
[SPEAKER_17]: It's alright, it's okay, you may go the other way We can try to understand, but you don't have to think of me It's alright, it's okay, come and see another day We can try to understand, but you don't have to think of me Ha ha ha ha ha

1521
01:55:28,383 --> 01:55:30,826
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, that was song number one in tonight's cage match.

1522
01:55:30,986 --> 01:55:32,928
[SPEAKER_06]: Ozzy Osbourne was staying alive.

1523
01:55:32,988 --> 01:55:34,730
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, song number two in tonight's cage match.

1524
01:55:34,770 --> 01:55:36,331
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to do my pick for song number two.

1525
01:55:37,132 --> 01:55:38,774
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've decided to pick this group.

1526
01:55:38,834 --> 01:55:42,237
[SPEAKER_06]: It's somebody I got turned on to by a friend who just saw them live recently.

1527
01:55:42,598 --> 01:55:45,360
[SPEAKER_06]: And I went and downloaded some of their stuff on iTunes, and I really dug it.

1528
01:55:45,400 --> 01:55:47,162
[SPEAKER_06]: So I wanted to share one of their songs with you guys.

1529
01:55:47,182 --> 01:55:47,743
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

1530
01:55:48,243 --> 01:55:48,584
[SPEAKER_06]: Bjerg Bjorg

1531
01:56:01,132 --> 01:56:03,392
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's actually pronounced Bjork, but everybody says Bjork.

1532
01:56:03,653 --> 01:56:05,953
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there's what, Sigurjós and all those bands too?

1533
01:56:05,973 --> 01:56:06,513
[SPEAKER_06]: Sigurjós.

1534
01:56:06,633 --> 01:56:08,173
[SPEAKER_06]: Sigurjós or whatever, Figaro.

1535
01:56:08,613 --> 01:56:13,434
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god, they should have like all the Icelandic bands do like one song together.

1536
01:56:13,514 --> 01:56:14,255
[SPEAKER_06]: All three of them.

1537
01:56:14,395 --> 01:56:18,675
[SPEAKER_06]: Not to make fun of Icelandic bands, because there's actually some pretty kickass music from Iceland.

1538
01:56:18,856 --> 01:56:19,656
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just funny names.

1539
01:56:20,216 --> 01:56:24,357
[SPEAKER_06]: So anyway, this band is Roisk... I think it's Roiskopp.

1540
01:56:25,037 --> 01:56:25,637
[SPEAKER_06]: Roiskopp?

1541
01:56:26,519 --> 01:56:33,562
[SPEAKER_06]: Roy Scopp, we'll say that, Roy Scopp, and the song is called Only This Moment, and it's song number two in tonight's cage match, enjoy.

1542
01:56:58,871 --> 01:56:59,513
Thanks for watching!

1543
01:58:34,785 --> 01:58:35,974
Thank you for watching!

1544
01:59:26,414 --> 01:59:44,346
All your things are just together, close to perfection Nothing else will always be right Trust in the light, stand on the side of the line, survive All your things are just together, close to perfection Nothing else will always be right Trust in the light, stand on the side

1545
02:00:29,456 --> 02:00:31,738
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, that was song number two in tonight's cage match.

1546
02:00:31,758 --> 02:00:34,820
[SPEAKER_06]: That was Roixop with Only This Moment.

1547
02:00:34,920 --> 02:00:38,644
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see if the other folks in the room liked it or didn't.

1548
02:00:39,164 --> 02:00:39,825
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.

1549
02:00:40,501 --> 02:00:45,303
[SPEAKER_14]: I liked it, but it was probably something I'd listen to if I was trying to go to sleep or like working on a picture or something.

1550
02:00:45,923 --> 02:00:46,944
[SPEAKER_14]: It's very good, I would give it an 8.

1551
02:00:47,784 --> 02:00:48,104
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki!

1552
02:00:48,124 --> 02:00:49,765
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually kind of like that.

1553
02:00:50,385 --> 02:00:51,466
[SPEAKER_06]: I would give it an 8 as well.

1554
02:00:52,286 --> 02:00:52,747
[SPEAKER_06]: Jonas!

1555
02:00:53,027 --> 02:00:53,567
[SPEAKER_06]: Exquisite!

1556
02:00:55,608 --> 02:00:57,209
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll give it like an 8.5 on this one.

1557
02:00:57,229 --> 02:01:03,531
[SPEAKER_21]: I actually like the tunes, kind of like, it reminds me back in the 8-bit days because of the tunes.

1558
02:01:04,092 --> 02:01:05,452
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's kind of what I like about it too.

1559
02:01:05,472 --> 02:01:06,993
[SPEAKER_21]: And it makes me feel relaxed and stuff.

1560
02:01:07,876 --> 02:01:10,059
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't care if it has cultural relevance!

1561
02:01:23,556 --> 02:01:24,276
[SPEAKER_14]: Shame, shame.

1562
02:01:24,356 --> 02:01:25,476
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all good, don't worry.

1563
02:01:25,856 --> 02:01:26,337
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

1564
02:01:27,277 --> 02:01:29,677
[SPEAKER_06]: What song are you putting in the cage match tonight, DarkSakura?

1565
02:01:29,817 --> 02:01:34,238
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a song we freaking should have had in rotation a long time ago, which I was afraid it already was.

1566
02:01:36,298 --> 02:01:39,419
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a different version, like a different mix of it in rotation.

1567
02:01:39,439 --> 02:01:40,199
[SPEAKER_14]: Like the crap version.

1568
02:01:40,299 --> 02:01:41,219
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1569
02:01:41,519 --> 02:01:43,599
[SPEAKER_14]: I am a big fan of the Best of Move series.

1570
02:01:43,660 --> 02:01:44,700
[SPEAKER_14]: I always have been.

1571
02:01:46,260 --> 02:01:48,540
[SPEAKER_14]: I can kick anybody's asses on this game.

1572
02:01:48,840 --> 02:01:49,421
[SPEAKER_14]: Challenge me.

1573
02:01:49,481 --> 02:01:50,421
[SPEAKER_14]: I swear I will own you.

1574
02:01:50,821 --> 02:01:51,781
[SPEAKER_06]: I challenge you.

1575
02:01:52,401 --> 02:01:53,182
[SPEAKER_14]: You know I'll own you.

1576
02:01:53,602 --> 02:01:54,663
[SPEAKER_06]: I challenge you.

1577
02:01:54,883 --> 02:01:55,744
[SPEAKER_06]: On-air duel.

1578
02:01:56,224 --> 02:01:58,706
[SPEAKER_14]: On the first one, I used to have all the commands memorized.

1579
02:01:58,947 --> 02:01:59,647
[SPEAKER_14]: I would play without them.

1580
02:01:59,867 --> 02:02:00,388
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

1581
02:02:01,068 --> 02:02:06,973
[SPEAKER_06]: On Busta... Well, for me it was Busta Groove, because I was raised on the US one.

1582
02:02:07,914 --> 02:02:15,541
[SPEAKER_06]: That is what I played non-stop before DDR, so... I think we would probably have to do like... We would just get perfect scores all the time.

1583
02:02:16,880 --> 02:02:19,142
[SPEAKER_14]: It would be a tough match, I'll put it that way.

1584
02:02:20,183 --> 02:02:27,970
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, this is from the first one, it's Kitty N's theme song from the Japanese one, so it's the good version, and not the one trying to sound like the real McCoy.

1585
02:02:27,990 --> 02:02:37,738
[SPEAKER_14]: I forgot who exactly was the singer on it, but it actually made top ten in the charts in Japan, from what I understand.

1586
02:02:38,398 --> 02:02:43,443
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's a big Avex Tracks song, so it's I'll Show You No Knife.

1587
02:02:44,554 --> 02:02:46,784
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, here it is, song number three in tonight's cage match.

1588
02:03:16,383 --> 02:03:17,406
Thanks for watching!

1589
02:03:57,845 --> 02:04:00,007
Thank you for watching.

1590
02:04:00,047 --> 02:04:02,770
Please subscribe to my channel.

1591
02:04:57,577 --> 02:04:59,758
Thank you for watching.

1592
02:04:59,859 --> 02:05:00,879
See you next time.

1593
02:07:23,499 --> 02:07:24,640
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, what you think?

1594
02:07:41,888 --> 02:07:46,833
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, it was pointed out to me that the file actually went wrong with the name.

1595
02:07:46,913 --> 02:07:48,335
[SPEAKER_14]: It's Alzora.

1596
02:07:48,935 --> 02:07:50,256
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh.

1597
02:07:51,678 --> 02:07:54,200
[SPEAKER_14]: But, at any rate, yeah, I love that song.

1598
02:07:54,280 --> 02:07:55,441
[SPEAKER_14]: I've loved that song forever.

1599
02:07:55,601 --> 02:07:56,442
[SPEAKER_14]: It gets an 11.

1600
02:07:58,564 --> 02:07:59,085
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, Loki.

1601
02:07:59,105 --> 02:08:01,687
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if it was an 11, but it was okay.

1602
02:08:01,767 --> 02:08:02,848
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I'd give it a 7.

1603
02:08:04,950 --> 02:08:06,592
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it sounds just like the original one to me.

1604
02:08:07,760 --> 02:08:08,901
[SPEAKER_14]: It is the original one.

1605
02:08:08,921 --> 02:08:10,322
[SPEAKER_05]: It sounds like the English one, okay?

1606
02:08:11,543 --> 02:08:12,444
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it doesn't.

1607
02:08:12,524 --> 02:08:13,024
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't matter.

1608
02:08:13,425 --> 02:08:13,825
[SPEAKER_05]: It's okay.

1609
02:08:14,025 --> 02:08:14,946
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just okay.

1610
02:08:16,347 --> 02:08:16,828
[SPEAKER_21]: Jonas.

1611
02:08:18,229 --> 02:08:24,495
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't see the big difference between the English version too much, except that the Japanese is a little better, but I'll say it's 8.

1612
02:08:24,875 --> 02:08:25,936
[SPEAKER_06]: I like that song a lot.

1613
02:08:25,976 --> 02:08:29,619
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish we had had that version of it in our Bust a Move, but we didn't.

1614
02:08:30,970 --> 02:08:33,232
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's getting, it's kinda, I don't know, it's kinda old.

1615
02:08:33,312 --> 02:08:36,395
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the only thing it has really going against it is that the song's kinda been out a while.

1616
02:08:36,435 --> 02:08:37,296
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's still a good song.

1617
02:08:37,996 --> 02:08:38,997
[SPEAKER_06]: I give it an 8 as well.

1618
02:08:39,778 --> 02:08:44,142
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's recap the three songs you kids can vote for tonight in the cage match.

1619
02:08:44,202 --> 02:08:45,763
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you can place your votes.

1620
02:08:46,264 --> 02:08:52,169
[SPEAKER_06]: So, let's start it off with song number one you can vote for tonight is Ozzy Osbourne with Stayin' Alive.

1621
02:08:58,604 --> 02:09:03,106
[SPEAKER_06]: And song number two you can vote for tonight is Royce Skopp with Only This Moment.

1622
02:09:10,930 --> 02:09:15,372
[SPEAKER_06]: And song number three you can vote for tonight is Avex with Pronounce This For Me, Jamie.

1623
02:09:17,553 --> 02:09:17,954
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1624
02:09:25,535 --> 02:09:28,657
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, place vote now.

1625
02:09:28,757 --> 02:09:35,481
[SPEAKER_06]: Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote, and we'll tally them up and let you know who the wiener is.

1626
02:09:36,522 --> 02:09:40,985
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, this is usually the part of the show where I ask you what's going on in the sim scene as if you're paying any attention to it.

1627
02:09:41,225 --> 02:09:42,505
[SPEAKER_05]: I am paying attention to it.

1628
02:09:42,926 --> 02:09:44,947
[SPEAKER_05]: I check my cell every day.

1629
02:09:46,428 --> 02:09:46,788
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1630
02:09:47,569 --> 02:09:50,250
[SPEAKER_05]: We already talked about tourney mix and how we don't care.

1631
02:09:51,951 --> 02:09:54,553
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, last tourney mix in case you missed it last week.

1632
02:09:55,520 --> 02:09:56,661
[SPEAKER_06]: is coming out pretty soon.

1633
02:09:57,182 --> 02:09:59,744
[SPEAKER_06]: Get your files in if you really want to participate.

1634
02:10:00,305 --> 02:10:04,789
[SPEAKER_05]: And then that's on ddrei.com.

1635
02:10:05,450 --> 02:10:17,761
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, of course, the DDR OSC competition, the Psychopath Edition, which is all funny files, that was judged and I think is over with.

1636
02:10:17,981 --> 02:10:19,262
[SPEAKER_05]: And nothing else going on.

1637
02:10:19,483 --> 02:10:20,143
[SPEAKER_18]: What about the fun mix?

1638
02:10:20,163 --> 02:10:20,864
It's a fun event.

1639
02:10:21,758 --> 02:10:23,039
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you retired from the sim scene?

1640
02:10:44,298 --> 02:10:45,879
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not making your crazy-ass sim files?

1641
02:10:45,899 --> 02:10:51,802
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a guy that actually posted a song file that said that he made it, I think it was a Max Remix, that said, by explicit.

1642
02:10:53,363 --> 02:10:54,343
[SPEAKER_05]: What the hell?

1643
02:10:54,363 --> 02:10:54,683
[SPEAKER_05]: Serious.

1644
02:10:55,544 --> 02:10:56,284
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't make this up.

1645
02:10:58,505 --> 02:11:09,091
[SPEAKER_21]: Interesting, I remember this before, someone sent, like, two of my sim files into B-Style, and I hammered it up too hard, so...

1646
02:11:10,834 --> 02:11:33,846
[SPEAKER_21]: except we got some, well I can't say the word new, who's that someone else by the name Explicit Alpha, because I'm Explicit Gamma on the B- style, he said some guy named Explicit Alpha sent a file called Legend of Trance 2004, hell no, that's the same person, I just have various Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, I don't know what's next, that is all.

1647
02:11:36,748 --> 02:11:37,048
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1648
02:11:37,711 --> 02:11:49,419
[SPEAKER_06]: While I'm tallying up the cage match votes over here, DarkSakura, why don't you fill us in on some of the other lovely programming we have here on Orange Launch Radio, at least the one other show we have right now.

1649
02:11:49,439 --> 02:11:49,999
[SPEAKER_14]: The one other show.

1650
02:11:50,680 --> 02:11:54,662
[SPEAKER_14]: On Tuesdays, pre-show starting at a quarter to seven, show starting at 7.30.

1651
02:11:55,002 --> 02:11:58,144
[SPEAKER_14]: That's Pacific time for everybody else.

1652
02:11:59,065 --> 02:12:06,530
[SPEAKER_14]: We have Pump Up the Volume, which is a music request show in theory, although I pretty much just submit everybody to whatever I want to play for them.

1653
02:12:08,140 --> 02:12:09,101
[SPEAKER_14]: It goes on to about 10.30.

1654
02:12:10,221 --> 02:12:13,764
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'd like to catch everybody up on this week in Max Remixes.

1655
02:12:14,944 --> 02:12:22,109
[SPEAKER_06]: Starting with Maximum, with three X's, by Mochi13.

1656
02:12:22,189 --> 02:12:27,733
[SPEAKER_06]: We have Max 300, the MSG Remix by Fear of the Dragon.

1657
02:12:28,213 --> 02:12:34,557
[SPEAKER_06]: Requiem for Max, Max 100, Max Takedown, Max Relord.

1658
02:12:35,438 --> 02:12:36,218
[SPEAKER_06]: Why Relord?

1659
02:12:36,238 --> 02:12:36,798
[SPEAKER_06]: What the hell?

1660
02:12:36,818 --> 02:12:37,699
[SPEAKER_06]: That doesn't make any sense.

1661
02:12:38,231 --> 02:12:51,746
[SPEAKER_06]: Relord, Max Cremation, Max Dominator, Zephyr, Max Speedmix, Max Francis, Max 300 Period, Max Hold.

1662
02:12:55,170 --> 02:12:55,450
[SPEAKER_06]: Stop.

1663
02:12:56,111 --> 02:12:57,192
[SPEAKER_06]: Just stop, people.

1664
02:13:00,083 --> 02:13:01,524
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's one, though, I swear.

1665
02:13:01,944 --> 02:13:06,126
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know it's one I downloaded just to check it out to see what it was.

1666
02:13:07,966 --> 02:13:08,967
[SPEAKER_06]: Max Takedown.

1667
02:13:09,907 --> 02:13:16,590
[SPEAKER_06]: And they say that the friend says, this is a version of Max that my friend Explicit made.

1668
02:13:16,770 --> 02:13:20,012
[SPEAKER_05]: What the hell?

1669
02:13:20,052 --> 02:13:20,372
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah.

1670
02:13:21,112 --> 02:13:21,572
Wow.

1671
02:13:21,893 --> 02:13:22,193
[SPEAKER_05]: Told you.

1672
02:13:24,434 --> 02:13:25,574
[SPEAKER_21]: Wow, just wow.

1673
02:13:25,634 --> 02:13:27,115
[SPEAKER_21]: There's only one Explicit.

1674
02:13:29,073 --> 02:13:29,973
[SPEAKER_06]: The Legend of Vertax

1675
02:13:49,517 --> 02:13:54,859
[SPEAKER_21]: Because they try to fuse In The Groove and DDR together, so they come up with this.

1676
02:13:55,239 --> 02:13:57,800
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I found this great new remix of Max recently.

1677
02:13:57,860 --> 02:13:59,361
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a really good Max mix.

1678
02:13:59,381 --> 02:14:03,122
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a good Max mix, huh?

1679
02:14:03,142 --> 02:14:05,663
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh wait, I'm just kidding, that's Energizer from In The Groove 2.

1680
02:14:08,344 --> 02:14:09,524
[SPEAKER_06]: That joke never gets old.

1681
02:14:10,004 --> 02:14:10,324
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

1682
02:14:10,344 --> 02:14:10,925
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh no.

1683
02:14:13,752 --> 02:14:15,893
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go to the cage match winner, shall we?

1684
02:14:16,633 --> 02:14:17,914
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to know who won tonight's cage match?

1685
02:14:18,254 --> 02:14:20,015
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't handle who won tonight's cage match!

1686
02:14:20,175 --> 02:14:20,736
[SPEAKER_17]: Why not?

1687
02:14:21,336 --> 02:14:24,437
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, the winner in tonight's cage match, very, very close.

1688
02:14:24,858 --> 02:14:26,338
[SPEAKER_06]: Very, very close battle tonight.

1689
02:14:26,438 --> 02:14:32,982
[SPEAKER_06]: But, in the end, one song squeaked by to win it, and it's the song from Bust a Move.

1690
02:14:34,923 --> 02:14:35,883
[SPEAKER_06]: Woohoo!

1691
02:14:36,663 --> 02:14:41,606
[SPEAKER_06]: Who knew that there were so many fanboys and fangirls in there for Bust a Move?

1692
02:14:42,535 --> 02:14:45,199
[SPEAKER_06]: Very, very close with the Roy Scup song, though.

1693
02:14:45,319 --> 02:14:45,880
[SPEAKER_06]: Very, very close.

1694
02:14:46,441 --> 02:14:51,889
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is unusual for my song to get that many votes, so... Damn you, DarkSakura.

1695
02:14:51,929 --> 02:14:52,610
[SPEAKER_21]: Damn you to heck.

1696
02:14:52,630 --> 02:14:53,492
[SPEAKER_21]: Whatever sounds better.

1697
02:14:54,073 --> 02:14:54,714
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, it's alright.

1698
02:14:55,174 --> 02:14:56,016
[SPEAKER_06]: I won't take it personally.

1699
02:15:00,922 --> 02:15:01,983
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go to a break, shall we?

1700
02:15:02,023 --> 02:15:02,723
[SPEAKER_06]: I promised a break.

1701
02:15:03,204 --> 02:15:06,506
[SPEAKER_06]: I unlocked the first picture in this wonderful game I'm playing.

1702
02:15:06,526 --> 02:15:08,367
[SPEAKER_06]: Playing Gal's Panic!

1703
02:15:08,407 --> 02:15:10,248
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm not playing Gal's Panic.

1704
02:15:10,488 --> 02:15:12,870
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm playing Peekaboo Poker for the NES.

1705
02:15:13,550 --> 02:15:14,551
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the few adult games.

1706
02:15:14,571 --> 02:15:15,712
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that like Bubble Bath Babes?

1707
02:15:16,112 --> 02:15:16,853
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe by the same company.

1708
02:15:17,213 --> 02:15:21,176
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, it says, Hi, I'm Full House Francine.

1709
02:15:21,616 --> 02:15:23,097
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you feeling lucky tonight?

1710
02:15:23,417 --> 02:15:24,798
[SPEAKER_07]: Want to fill up my house?

1711
02:15:26,379 --> 02:15:28,380
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is like the worst graphics in the world.

1712
02:15:29,181 --> 02:15:30,742
[SPEAKER_05]: This is what they need to be coming after.

1713
02:15:32,028 --> 02:15:35,630
[SPEAKER_05]: These really sick games for the Nintendo Entertainment System.

1714
02:15:37,432 --> 02:15:38,112
[SPEAKER_06]: Bad Nintendo.

1715
02:15:38,933 --> 02:15:39,253
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

1716
02:15:40,514 --> 02:15:42,355
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to go to a break, you guys.

1717
02:15:42,595 --> 02:15:45,817
[SPEAKER_06]: And this song here, we're going to start it off with a special dedication.

1718
02:15:45,857 --> 02:15:49,099
[SPEAKER_06]: This is Let's Groove from DDR Max.

1719
02:15:49,340 --> 02:15:52,081
[SPEAKER_06]: And Ron Chan wanted to hear this one, so we're dedicating it to him.

1720
02:15:52,722 --> 02:15:53,582
[SPEAKER_06]: And here it is.

1721
02:15:53,963 --> 02:15:54,203
[SPEAKER_06]: Enjoy.

1722
02:15:54,223 --> 02:15:54,323
[SPEAKER_06]: Enjoy.

1723
02:16:52,740 --> 02:16:53,269
[SPEAKER_17]: All right!

1724
02:20:25,876 --> 02:20:26,624
Thanks for watching!

1725
02:21:00,290 --> 02:21:02,651
Thanks for watching!

1726
02:22:13,531 --> 02:22:14,394
Thanks for watching!

1727
02:22:55,262 --> 02:23:00,924
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Random Person on the Street, who, by the way, is not an actor, what do you think of the Orange Lounge mainlining music in Morse Show?

1728
02:23:01,205 --> 02:23:08,368
[SPEAKER_09]: The music is like being transported to just this dancing spaceship place.

1729
02:23:08,708 --> 02:23:08,828
[SPEAKER_09]: It's...

1730
02:23:10,245 --> 02:23:10,685
[SPEAKER_09]: on Earthly.

1731
02:23:10,925 --> 02:23:14,647
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like being in a club, except you don't have to actually ask someone to dance.

1732
02:23:34,213 --> 02:23:35,355
[SPEAKER_06]: Jonas, that goes double for you.

1733
02:23:36,217 --> 02:23:37,259
[SPEAKER_06]: You haven't been here in a while.

1734
02:23:37,319 --> 02:23:38,461
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you've got some stored up.

1735
02:23:38,601 --> 02:23:41,466
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you going to cut it up like they cut me up in the interview?

1736
02:23:41,506 --> 02:23:44,251
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I will cut you up just like they cut up Loki's interview.

1737
02:23:44,632 --> 02:23:45,594
Remember, I cut myself up with

1738
02:23:47,061 --> 02:23:47,822
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, yeah, that's right.

1739
02:23:48,142 --> 02:23:49,783
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, moving on.

1740
02:23:50,943 --> 02:23:57,586
[SPEAKER_06]: First, before we get to the FUs of the week though, Loki wanted me to talk about this because he's like, Rob, you have to talk about this story I posted, so fine.

1741
02:23:58,086 --> 02:24:04,009
[SPEAKER_06]: DJ Maxx, it's this Korean online rhythm music game and it's going to be coming out for the PSP.

1742
02:24:04,329 --> 02:24:05,910
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell us a little more about DJ Maxx, Loki.

1743
02:24:05,930 --> 02:24:13,973
[SPEAKER_05]: DJ Maxx was by the creators of Easy to DJ, those who may not remember Easy to DJ, was the actual competitor for Beatmania out there.

1744
02:24:14,677 --> 02:24:21,081
[SPEAKER_05]: It was 5 key with turntables, kind of set up like Beatmania 2DX where the turntables are on the outside.

1745
02:24:21,501 --> 02:24:23,583
[SPEAKER_05]: Also had foot pedals on it, just like Beatmania 3.

1746
02:24:24,803 --> 02:24:26,464
[SPEAKER_05]: So this game's coming out now.

1747
02:24:26,544 --> 02:24:32,328
[SPEAKER_05]: DJ Max though, it's only 5 key, I believe it's only 5 key and no turntable.

1748
02:24:32,448 --> 02:24:33,289
[SPEAKER_05]: No, actually I take that back.

1749
02:24:33,309 --> 02:24:35,230
[SPEAKER_05]: 7 key, no turntable.

1750
02:24:36,150 --> 02:24:37,891
[SPEAKER_05]: But the songs are awesome.

1751
02:24:38,012 --> 02:24:42,254
[SPEAKER_05]: They're by the same artists that were in Easy to DJ and the quality is just really good.

1752
02:24:42,334 --> 02:24:43,555
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an online game right now.

1753
02:24:44,025 --> 02:24:47,986
[SPEAKER_05]: But it is coming, well they have a cell phone version I guess, but this one's coming to the PSP.

1754
02:24:49,146 --> 02:24:52,427
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it going to suck as much as like Beatmania on Gameboy?

1755
02:24:53,768 --> 02:24:54,388
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think so.

1756
02:24:54,468 --> 02:25:00,830
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the way they can do it, because it's just five key presses, so I'm sure they can map it out in some way that'll make sense.

1757
02:25:02,790 --> 02:25:06,831
[SPEAKER_06]: They should do the type of thing where you can turn it like on its side, so you can see the notes coming down better.

1758
02:25:06,851 --> 02:25:09,112
[SPEAKER_06]: They did that on Wonderswan.

1759
02:25:09,875 --> 02:25:12,017
[SPEAKER_06]: PSP Keyboard Version 2.0 Firmware Next Week

1760
02:25:32,771 --> 02:25:37,516
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um... Is that the white PSP coming out at that same time, too?

1761
02:25:37,977 --> 02:25:39,238
[SPEAKER_05]: White PSP's coming out in September.

1762
02:25:39,318 --> 02:25:46,687
[SPEAKER_06]: It will be built in with firmware 2.0, so... Didn't you say you were going to buy two, just so you could have your old emulator PSP?

1763
02:25:47,267 --> 02:25:50,511
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I wanted to buy two just because of that, because I'm...

1764
02:25:50,973 --> 02:25:58,437
[SPEAKER_05]: Curious to see, what I want to do is if the PSP looks like it can download files, and if it can download audio files, it can download our podcast.

1765
02:25:58,718 --> 02:26:06,062
[SPEAKER_05]: If it can download our podcast, I'm going to make a PSP page where you can download the podcast on the format for the PSP and whatnot, special content, that type of thing.

1766
02:26:06,822 --> 02:26:07,222
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

1767
02:26:08,523 --> 02:26:10,264
[SPEAKER_05]: So, but this looks really cool.

1768
02:26:10,684 --> 02:26:18,089
[SPEAKER_05]: First, like, rhythm music game that I think is coming, well, unless you count Luminous, but that's not really a rhythm music game, it's more of a puzzle game.

1769
02:26:18,369 --> 02:26:20,070
[SPEAKER_05]: But this is going to be coming out, um,

1770
02:26:20,814 --> 02:26:21,174
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura

1771
02:26:48,584 --> 02:26:50,065
[SPEAKER_06]: This is all happening because of you.

1772
02:26:50,125 --> 02:26:51,426
[SPEAKER_06]: This was all your idea.

1773
02:26:51,746 --> 02:26:54,548
[SPEAKER_06]: Your big evil empire that you've built since episode one.

1774
02:26:54,848 --> 02:26:57,971
[SPEAKER_06]: Why is it that we have to do these FUs of the week every single week?

1775
02:26:59,712 --> 02:27:17,104
[SPEAKER_14]: My big, humongous FU goes for the... First FU to that microphone because it's fucking up again.

1776
02:27:17,714 --> 02:27:19,335
[SPEAKER_06]: We're just gonna have to replace the damn thing.

1777
02:27:19,355 --> 02:27:19,916
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead and try.

1778
02:27:20,236 --> 02:27:22,258
[SPEAKER_14]: No, what about the one I bought?

1779
02:27:23,419 --> 02:27:24,460
[SPEAKER_06]: We could always sub that in.

1780
02:27:24,740 --> 02:27:24,940
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1781
02:27:24,980 --> 02:27:25,581
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we'll have a look.

1782
02:27:26,702 --> 02:27:27,502
[SPEAKER_14]: It's right there behind you.

1783
02:27:28,523 --> 02:27:29,284
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it plugged in?

1784
02:27:30,145 --> 02:27:31,746
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I can just take the top off of it.

1785
02:27:32,847 --> 02:27:34,628
[SPEAKER_14]: First off, he goes through technical difficulties.

1786
02:27:35,169 --> 02:27:35,749
[SPEAKER_14]: Hold on a sec.

1787
02:27:41,534 --> 02:27:42,195
[SPEAKER_14]: There we go.

1788
02:27:42,395 --> 02:27:42,895
[SPEAKER_14]: Much better.

1789
02:27:44,036 --> 02:27:45,698
[SPEAKER_14]: Bye bye, piece of shit microphone!

1790
02:27:47,981 --> 02:27:49,923
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, F you to the microphone.

1791
02:27:50,243 --> 02:27:51,064
[SPEAKER_14]: F you to work.

1792
02:27:52,185 --> 02:27:57,430
[SPEAKER_14]: Specifically, and now keep in mind, I adore, you know, I adore my co-workers.

1793
02:27:57,710 --> 02:27:58,811
[SPEAKER_14]: My boss is pretty cool.

1794
02:27:59,612 --> 02:28:09,881
[SPEAKER_14]: But, just, a good manager should not let their stress bleed onto their employees, right?

1795
02:28:11,482 --> 02:28:12,203
[SPEAKER_14]: That's been happening.

1796
02:28:13,664 --> 02:28:41,933
[SPEAKER_14]: and I have been getting all stressed out at work and it's not good if I get all stressed out Thursday I went home sick with a combination of fatigue, low blood sugar and a pretty high level of stress ended up having a venti green tea frappuccino which I finished in twice the time Dan finished his and I still laid down at 9 o'clock and didn't wake up until 2 when he came home with his new car which is a model up for mine and brand new but my car still looks better I digress

1797
02:28:43,715 --> 02:28:45,816
[SPEAKER_14]: That's really it, really it.

1798
02:28:46,196 --> 02:28:47,757
[SPEAKER_14]: And also, oh yeah, F.U.

1799
02:28:47,777 --> 02:28:49,839
[SPEAKER_14]: to how expensive the furniture we want is.

1800
02:28:50,539 --> 02:28:50,959
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, I'm done.

1801
02:28:51,379 --> 02:28:54,601
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's move on to Loki's F.U.s of the week.

1802
02:28:57,483 --> 02:28:59,244
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's so fun.

1803
02:29:00,364 --> 02:29:00,945
[SPEAKER_06]: The first F.U.

1804
02:29:00,965 --> 02:29:02,666
[SPEAKER_06]: of the week goes to KCRA3.

1805
02:29:03,046 --> 02:29:09,189
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, now, I have to preface this with the fact Brian, the interviewer, he was great.

1806
02:29:09,390 --> 02:29:11,731
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, the reporter was awesome, the cameraman was awesome.

1807
02:29:12,762 --> 02:29:16,505
[SPEAKER_06]: Just whoever edited the damn thing, not awesome, okay?

1808
02:29:16,645 --> 02:29:20,908
[SPEAKER_06]: They really need to learn we're better than heat, okay?

1809
02:29:21,148 --> 02:29:32,497
[SPEAKER_06]: So, no plug, they fucking suck for that, and the fact that they cut this, like, really stupid clip of me talking and saying, it's so fun, you know, don't even put me in it at all, okay?

1810
02:29:32,537 --> 02:29:34,619
[SPEAKER_06]: Because at least I don't look like a fucking idiot.

1811
02:29:35,039 --> 02:29:35,940
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

1812
02:29:37,230 --> 02:29:41,231
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm definitely going to have some written contract for the next person that interviews us.

1813
02:29:41,791 --> 02:29:43,851
[SPEAKER_05]: There's going to be some serious issues.

1814
02:29:44,551 --> 02:29:44,891
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways.

1815
02:29:46,092 --> 02:29:46,992
[SPEAKER_06]: So fuck you to that.

1816
02:29:47,732 --> 02:29:50,832
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck you to stupid people that are driving too damn slow.

1817
02:29:50,892 --> 02:29:52,473
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially people from Arizona.

1818
02:29:52,933 --> 02:29:57,934
[SPEAKER_06]: Like this woman today, uh... It was like... I don't even remember what it was.

1819
02:29:57,994 --> 02:30:04,495
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like... Like... Old... Old... Toot or something like that is what the license plate said.

1820
02:30:04,515 --> 02:30:05,175
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just like...

1821
02:30:05,822 --> 02:30:12,667
[SPEAKER_05]: No, old fart or something, old toot, you know, I'm like... Okay, so I think it was actually this old guy.

1822
02:30:13,007 --> 02:30:16,249
[SPEAKER_05]: When we drove by him, the guy looked like he was a corpse driving the car.

1823
02:30:16,790 --> 02:30:20,212
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, head is back like... Driving the car.

1824
02:30:20,732 --> 02:30:21,313
[SPEAKER_06]: Really hilarious.

1825
02:30:21,786 --> 02:30:22,607
[SPEAKER_06]: This is what you do.

1826
02:30:22,627 --> 02:30:23,607
[SPEAKER_06]: You tell them it's a health hazard.

1827
02:30:23,627 --> 02:30:24,268
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll be on it fast.

1828
02:30:47,423 --> 02:30:48,383
[SPEAKER_06]: No, they're just retarded.

1829
02:30:48,403 --> 02:30:54,165
[SPEAKER_06]: They're replacing the whole unit and they fucked something up so they have to, you know, come out Monday first thing and fix it.

1830
02:30:55,146 --> 02:31:01,808
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently this wasn't the first apartment that they did that to because they were telling me that, oh yeah, we replaced the whole unit and it's defective already.

1831
02:31:02,348 --> 02:31:06,150
[SPEAKER_05]: So we had to sit there for messing around with it and figure out what was wrong.

1832
02:31:06,170 --> 02:31:11,812
[SPEAKER_05]: So fuck you to that and fuck you to my mom's stupid dog for keeping me up every night because she wanted attention at three in the morning.

1833
02:31:12,772 --> 02:31:13,092
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

1834
02:31:15,513 --> 02:31:15,793
[SPEAKER_06]: My turn.

1835
02:31:22,799 --> 02:31:26,242
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to give an F you to 12-hour workdays like the one I had on Friday.

1836
02:31:26,562 --> 02:31:36,149
[SPEAKER_06]: That kind of sucked because I came home and I napped for a long time and then I ended up staying up until like 4 in the morning because my sleep schedule was just all screwed up.

1837
02:31:36,909 --> 02:31:38,810
[SPEAKER_06]: But don't get me wrong, I love my job.

1838
02:31:38,971 --> 02:31:40,331
[SPEAKER_06]: I could do without the 12-hour workdays.

1839
02:31:40,612 --> 02:31:44,414
[SPEAKER_06]: If I could do my job 8 hours evenly every day, I'd be fine.

1840
02:31:45,175 --> 02:31:45,295
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

1841
02:31:46,212 --> 02:31:47,493
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh well, I guess it comes with the territory.

1842
02:31:48,213 --> 02:31:53,036
[SPEAKER_06]: An F you to the fact that I have to travel soon because I'm going to miss being here for two weeks.

1843
02:31:54,817 --> 02:32:00,940
[SPEAKER_06]: It makes it hard to do a podcast every single week when I'm not going to be here and trying to do a three hour show as well.

1844
02:32:01,120 --> 02:32:02,141
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to be here for that.

1845
02:32:02,661 --> 02:32:10,605
[SPEAKER_06]: So, a general angst to leaving and then going to an area that's going to be, you know, it's not like I'm going to Disneyland, people.

1846
02:32:12,046 --> 02:32:14,087
[SPEAKER_06]: So, oh well, it comes with the territory.

1847
02:32:14,968 --> 02:32:15,328
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, um,

1848
02:32:17,199 --> 02:32:24,683
[SPEAKER_06]: An F you to the fact that when I tried to play 2DX 6 style and 3rd style earlier this week, they wouldn't work with my component cables for some reason.

1849
02:32:24,703 --> 02:32:26,984
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't figure out if that's a resolution thing or what the hell is going on.

1850
02:32:27,324 --> 02:32:31,045
[SPEAKER_06]: So F you to me being a technological idiot when it comes to the new TV.

1851
02:32:31,446 --> 02:32:33,827
[SPEAKER_06]: But otherwise, I love my new TV.

1852
02:32:33,867 --> 02:32:35,067
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so pretty.

1853
02:32:35,428 --> 02:32:37,428
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and F you to how bad I suck at Halo 2.

1854
02:32:38,109 --> 02:32:38,389
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all.

1855
02:32:39,488 --> 02:32:44,732
[SPEAKER_06]: Moving on to the one and only Explicit Alright, I'll keep it quick in quick summaries, alright?

1856
02:32:45,492 --> 02:33:07,728
[SPEAKER_21]: FU to the whole adults only for GTA Like everybody already mentioned it a while ago And the fact that the ESRP is gonna kill sales for all those M or AO games Look what you did And FU goes to the neighbors for blaming us for killing their plants over water issues First of all, we didn't spill any water

1857
02:33:08,584 --> 02:33:10,525
[SPEAKER_21]: or leak any water out of nowhere.

1858
02:33:11,126 --> 02:33:14,107
[SPEAKER_21]: Second of all, is it even our house that was leaking water?

1859
02:33:15,728 --> 02:33:20,972
[SPEAKER_21]: And after it goes to the spot being broken still, I still need to get a hot tub massage.

1860
02:33:22,733 --> 02:33:28,516
[SPEAKER_21]: And after it goes to my tail bump being all fucked up, I gotta go check on the doctor for that one.

1861
02:33:29,577 --> 02:33:32,099
[SPEAKER_21]: And after it goes to Manfei on Anime Expo.

1862
02:33:33,652 --> 02:33:35,113
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh my god, Manfei is back?

1863
02:33:35,714 --> 02:33:36,815
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, he is back.

1864
02:33:37,756 --> 02:33:41,620
[SPEAKER_14]: I saw Manfei at, uh, at Faname a few years ago.

1865
02:33:43,281 --> 02:33:46,204
[SPEAKER_14]: A guy who cosplays as Fei, and he's really hairy.

1866
02:33:47,846 --> 02:33:52,750
[SPEAKER_14]: And I don't mean hairy as in scary, although Yae is scary, but I mean hairy as in covered in fur like a bear.

1867
02:33:54,132 --> 02:33:58,276
[SPEAKER_21]: Surprisingly he got arre- well, he didn't get arrested, but he's banned from Anime Expo, but he's-

1868
02:33:59,252 --> 02:34:03,695
[SPEAKER_21]: almost mooned and stuck his ass up with my friend who tried to tag on his shoe.

1869
02:34:03,715 --> 02:34:12,900
[SPEAKER_14]: I have only, sorry, I've only ever once seen good crossplay as in a guy crossplaying a girl.

1870
02:34:13,761 --> 02:34:17,503
[SPEAKER_14]: And that was a really pretty, pretty guy crossplaying Utena.

1871
02:34:18,184 --> 02:34:18,724
[SPEAKER_14]: From the movie.

1872
02:34:19,665 --> 02:34:20,625
[SPEAKER_21]: A pretty guy.

1873
02:34:21,025 --> 02:34:22,046
[SPEAKER_14]: A really pretty guy.

1874
02:34:23,467 --> 02:34:25,368
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, what was I going to say?

1875
02:34:25,388 --> 02:34:26,069
[SPEAKER_21]: Effie goes to...

1876
02:34:27,757 --> 02:34:31,880
[SPEAKER_21]: This one lady that hit me during the time I was in L.A.

1877
02:34:32,981 --> 02:34:37,384
[SPEAKER_21]: She rear-ended me and even though there was no damage, she hit and run and blamed it was my fault.

1878
02:34:38,085 --> 02:34:41,767
[SPEAKER_21]: How is it my fault when you drove 15 miles an hour on the goddamn drive-thru?

1879
02:34:43,508 --> 02:34:44,489
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't understand that.

1880
02:34:45,590 --> 02:34:50,814
[SPEAKER_21]: You drive 15 miles an hour on a drive-thru and you accuse someone because they stopped.

1881
02:34:52,875 --> 02:34:53,736
[SPEAKER_21]: Who's to blame here?

1882
02:34:56,483 --> 02:34:57,104
[SPEAKER_21]: Uh, let's see.

1883
02:34:57,224 --> 02:35:02,089
[SPEAKER_21]: An FB to... Sir, stupid little kid just stepped on my foot!

1884
02:35:03,290 --> 02:35:04,551
[SPEAKER_21]: It might be really this big.

1885
02:35:04,571 --> 02:35:10,177
[SPEAKER_13]: And... I'm not gonna make a comment.

1886
02:35:12,279 --> 02:35:15,342
[SPEAKER_21]: And because I want to make sure I don't get cut off, I'll say doopie continue.

1887
02:35:15,362 --> 02:35:16,142
[SPEAKER_21]: Wait, actually, one more.

1888
02:35:16,162 --> 02:35:16,583
[SPEAKER_21]: There's one more.

1889
02:35:17,878 --> 02:35:23,502
[SPEAKER_21]: And a big if it goes to the whole tournament drama that was leading to the pit tournament.

1890
02:35:23,962 --> 02:35:27,204
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, they wanted to ban some guy, that didn't make me happy.

1891
02:35:27,604 --> 02:35:33,428
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, even though I cleared it out in a bad way, it damaged my reputation in a way.

1892
02:35:33,468 --> 02:35:36,330
[SPEAKER_06]: Well not you, don't take it personally, it's not you, it's the other guy.

1893
02:35:36,670 --> 02:35:39,252
[SPEAKER_06]: He needs to go out, he needs to be publicly spanked.

1894
02:35:40,953 --> 02:35:41,693
[SPEAKER_06]: He might like that though.

1895
02:35:41,713 --> 02:35:44,195
[SPEAKER_21]: I wonder what's going to happen in the tournament, that's all I want to know.

1896
02:35:44,375 --> 02:35:44,655
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1897
02:35:46,239 --> 02:35:48,782
[SPEAKER_06]: You know I gotta back Toadie up, no matter what happens.

1898
02:35:48,902 --> 02:35:52,626
[SPEAKER_21]: I know the band decision was uncalled for.

1899
02:35:52,826 --> 02:35:56,991
[SPEAKER_21]: That's why I cleared everything up to make sure, in a peaceful manner, drama.

1900
02:35:57,191 --> 02:35:58,613
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, it's cool.

1901
02:35:58,653 --> 02:35:59,133
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be cool.

1902
02:35:59,333 --> 02:36:01,856
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's move on to the chatroom FU, shall we?

1903
02:36:02,377 --> 02:36:06,181
[SPEAKER_06]: And somebody said that this song is so horrid that I had to use this as the background music.

1904
02:36:07,613 --> 02:36:14,939
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see, Misty wants to say an FU to the USB reader on the Indigroove 2, not responding to my card or any other card that was tried.

1905
02:36:15,280 --> 02:36:17,862
[SPEAKER_06]: Hope it's a problem that can be fixed with just a reboot.

1906
02:36:18,462 --> 02:36:23,706
[SPEAKER_06]: Socorina says, FU to the retard who let my 9-year-old brother play Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.

1907
02:36:25,388 --> 02:36:32,934
[SPEAKER_06]: Acer800 says, FU to the AC not working for a month, and my mom getting mad at me for listening to the FUs last week.

1908
02:36:33,775 --> 02:36:35,215
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not a children's program.

1909
02:36:35,515 --> 02:36:36,476
[SPEAKER_06]: Not saying you're a child.

1910
02:36:36,596 --> 02:36:37,396
[SPEAKER_21]: Adults only.

1911
02:36:38,196 --> 02:36:42,057
[SPEAKER_06]: Buy headphones, okay, if you're gonna listen to our naughty language.

1912
02:36:44,438 --> 02:36:51,560
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, we have Reznor says a nice fuck you to cum shots being more risque than shooting someone in the ass with a hand cannon.

1913
02:36:54,540 --> 02:37:00,002
[SPEAKER_06]: Sakura Sin says F you to Nintendo for not making any good puzzle games lately to keep me busy.

1914
02:37:01,004 --> 02:37:02,185
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, did you play Meteos?

1915
02:37:02,365 --> 02:37:05,147
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I realize Nintendo didn't make that, but Meteos is very cool.

1916
02:37:05,247 --> 02:37:06,108
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got to recommend that.

1917
02:37:07,028 --> 02:37:10,551
[SPEAKER_06]: Illusion says, F you to cutting my gums a few minutes ago, and now they're bleeding.

1918
02:37:12,212 --> 02:37:15,354
[SPEAKER_06]: And Ron Chan says, F you to the post office.

1919
02:37:16,034 --> 02:37:18,796
[SPEAKER_06]: It was supposed to come Friday, but it came Saturday, and I had left.

1920
02:37:18,876 --> 02:37:19,377
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck you.

1921
02:37:19,797 --> 02:37:22,359
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and F you to me running out of space on my hard drive.

1922
02:37:24,640 --> 02:37:27,382
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it for our angsty chatroom F yous.

1923
02:37:27,502 --> 02:37:28,123
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay.

1924
02:37:28,243 --> 02:37:28,563
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1925
02:37:30,667 --> 02:37:35,189
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it was kind of light on the angst tonight.

1926
02:37:35,789 --> 02:37:36,529
[SPEAKER_06]: It was angst light.

1927
02:37:36,569 --> 02:37:37,770
[SPEAKER_06]: Diet angst tonight.

1928
02:37:37,850 --> 02:37:38,310
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all right.

1929
02:37:39,530 --> 02:37:44,873
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, what we're going to do now, I think we're going to go ahead and go to another break.

1930
02:37:48,786 --> 02:37:50,007
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll make this a quick break.

1931
02:37:50,647 --> 02:37:54,909
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone wanted to hear... There were some songs that folks wanted to hear and I already forgot what some of them were.

1932
02:37:55,129 --> 02:37:56,570
[SPEAKER_06]: I think someone wanted to hear System Romance.

1933
02:37:56,670 --> 02:38:01,052
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to get to System Romance and I'll get into another song that somebody else wanted to hear.

1934
02:38:02,853 --> 02:38:03,093
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

1935
02:38:04,954 --> 02:38:05,594
[SPEAKER_13]: Last Message.

1936
02:38:06,275 --> 02:38:07,075
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to hear Last Message?

1937
02:38:07,095 --> 02:38:07,835
[SPEAKER_06]: Fine, we'll get to Last Message.

1938
02:38:07,855 --> 02:38:12,598
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to make this a short break because we're looking for questions for Ask Orange Lounge.

1939
02:38:12,618 --> 02:38:17,240
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right, it's time to Ask Orange Lounge or tonight you can ask Jonas as well if you want to.

1940
02:38:18,059 --> 02:38:19,840
[SPEAKER_06]: What the hell is that metal that you're wearing around your neck?

1941
02:38:19,880 --> 02:38:20,501
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I want to know.

1942
02:38:21,121 --> 02:38:22,302
[SPEAKER_04]: John Cena's a spinner.

1943
02:38:22,442 --> 02:38:23,122
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a spinner?

1944
02:38:23,883 --> 02:38:25,884
[SPEAKER_21]: This is what I got from the WWE event.

1945
02:38:25,924 --> 02:38:27,285
[SPEAKER_21]: It's the spinner from John Cena.

1946
02:38:28,886 --> 02:38:30,206
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, you can't see me.

1947
02:38:31,067 --> 02:38:31,807
[SPEAKER_14]: Obfuscate.

1948
02:38:32,788 --> 02:38:41,233
[SPEAKER_14]: For anyone who's ever played live action Vampire, his little waving his hand in front of his face thing is also the obfuscate action for live action Vampire.

1949
02:38:41,393 --> 02:38:41,813
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, wow.

1950
02:38:42,113 --> 02:38:43,174
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you can't see me.

1951
02:38:43,594 --> 02:38:44,375
Okay.

1952
02:38:45,174 --> 02:38:46,255
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that was the other request.

1953
02:38:46,295 --> 02:38:47,837
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody wanted to hear something from Silent Hills.

1954
02:38:47,877 --> 02:38:49,578
[SPEAKER_06]: So how about instead we hear some You're Not Here.

1955
02:38:50,279 --> 02:38:51,380
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that acceptable, DarkSakura?

1956
02:38:52,561 --> 02:38:53,122
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, okay.

1957
02:38:54,002 --> 02:38:54,203
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1958
02:38:55,424 --> 02:38:56,044
[SPEAKER_06]: You gonna be okay?

1959
02:38:56,545 --> 02:38:57,746
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay!

1960
02:38:58,487 --> 02:38:59,428
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so we'll get to that.

1961
02:38:59,788 --> 02:39:01,950
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.

1962
02:41:26,198 --> 02:41:30,119
It's got to be forever, the raindrops blowing, the wind is dancing

1963
02:41:50,294 --> 02:42:00,902
[SPEAKER_17]: It would be a much better sight with you with me If you hadn't met me, I'd be fine on my own, baby Never felt so lonely when you came along

1964
02:42:09,368 --> 02:42:12,189
[SPEAKER_17]: So now what should I do?

1965
02:42:12,410 --> 02:42:27,716
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm strung out, addicted to you My body aches now that you're gone My sublime fell through You let me give me everything you had and more You craved my happiness when you made me feel joy in me Just smile for now

1966
02:42:37,219 --> 02:42:40,760
Oh hi, dead air because I forgot to put in a promo there.

1967
02:42:40,780 --> 02:42:41,200
We're back!

1968
02:43:07,352 --> 02:43:10,174
[SPEAKER_14]: Listen to Orange Lounge Radio or we eat your liver!

1969
02:43:39,952 --> 02:43:42,913
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid questions.

1970
02:43:43,374 --> 02:43:46,695
[SPEAKER_06]: What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?

1971
02:43:47,335 --> 02:43:48,596
[SPEAKER_06]: What will the chatroom ask?

1972
02:43:48,916 --> 02:43:50,497
[SPEAKER_06]: Will it be a G-rated question?

1973
02:43:50,837 --> 02:43:53,958
[SPEAKER_06]: I really hope so, because this show's already too much A-O.

1974
02:44:06,760 --> 02:44:15,426
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see, Tomokun wants to know, why was 180 mode pissed away on Parapara dancing and not in Parapara Paradise?

1975
02:44:17,127 --> 02:44:21,069
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm assuming that's when you can turn around and do Parapara the other way?

1976
02:44:21,270 --> 02:44:23,451
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, so people can actually watch you doing the dancing?

1977
02:44:24,152 --> 02:44:26,713
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't play enough Parapara to follow that stuff, I have to admit.

1978
02:44:27,034 --> 02:44:31,256
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I thought it was cute for like a week, but... Do you know anything about that?

1979
02:44:31,617 --> 02:44:31,737
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

1980
02:44:32,898 --> 02:44:33,298
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know!

1981
02:44:34,233 --> 02:44:37,614
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, sometimes they just take modes out.

1982
02:44:37,894 --> 02:44:41,155
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you look up, aren't there only sensors on the front part of it?

1983
02:44:41,195 --> 02:44:43,656
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't they not have sensors on the back part of a Parapar machine?

1984
02:44:44,396 --> 02:44:44,897
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember.

1985
02:44:45,597 --> 02:44:47,597
[SPEAKER_06]: No, they don't, but you could probably put one there.

1986
02:44:47,617 --> 02:44:48,278
[SPEAKER_06]: You can mount it.

1987
02:44:48,518 --> 02:44:52,179
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess you could flip it around if you wanted to, but... No.

1988
02:44:53,299 --> 02:44:53,579
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, well.

1989
02:44:54,280 --> 02:44:56,540
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, don't know enough about Parapar to answer your question.

1990
02:44:56,580 --> 02:44:59,541
[SPEAKER_06]: Boy, do we suck or what.

1991
02:44:59,581 --> 02:45:00,062
[SPEAKER_06]: Moving on.

1992
02:45:00,082 --> 02:45:00,122
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

1993
02:45:03,382 --> 02:45:07,284
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, this question is pretty much setting us up to drop the clip again.

1994
02:45:07,324 --> 02:45:08,024
[SPEAKER_06]: You know that, right?

1995
02:45:08,044 --> 02:45:14,667
[SPEAKER_06]: Illusion basically wanted to know, what does Loki think of sex with children?

1996
02:45:15,007 --> 02:45:17,628
[SPEAKER_10]: It's great that... Free for the producers.

1997
02:45:17,968 --> 02:45:19,589
[SPEAKER_10]: Free speech for everyone.

1998
02:45:20,089 --> 02:45:21,130
[SPEAKER_10]: It's so much fun.

1999
02:45:21,390 --> 02:45:21,930
[SPEAKER_17]: There you go.

2000
02:45:21,950 --> 02:45:23,130
[SPEAKER_10]: Shut up!

2001
02:45:23,150 --> 02:45:23,411
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, yeah.

2002
02:45:23,451 --> 02:45:25,191
[SPEAKER_07]: Way to go, Rob.

2003
02:45:34,158 --> 02:45:34,578
[SPEAKER_17]: Bird!

2004
02:45:36,520 --> 02:45:37,240
[SPEAKER_06]: Give me that, then!

2005
02:45:37,761 --> 02:45:40,963
[SPEAKER_06]: Misty says, what song was playing during Explicits FUs?

2006
02:45:41,023 --> 02:45:43,986
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I recognized it, but I'm not sure because I hardly heard it.

2007
02:45:44,366 --> 02:45:49,990
[SPEAKER_06]: The song that was playing during Explicits FUs was EVO 66 from 2DX Red.

2008
02:45:50,010 --> 02:45:58,777
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what song we had.

2009
02:45:59,058 --> 02:45:59,738
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the worst part.

2010
02:45:59,758 --> 02:46:00,419
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go, here we go.

2011
02:46:02,503 --> 02:46:05,545
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the song I was playing, Wall 5, 2DX Red.

2012
02:46:06,446 --> 02:46:07,867
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought it was an appropriate F.U.

2013
02:46:07,887 --> 02:46:08,127
[SPEAKER_06]: song.

2014
02:46:08,307 --> 02:46:11,369
[SPEAKER_21]: I didn't even know there was a background when I was listening to F.U.s.

2015
02:46:12,768 --> 02:46:18,472
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, RainbowsInTheNight wants to know, how can I fix my metal dance pad from Red Octane?

2016
02:46:18,853 --> 02:46:21,755
[SPEAKER_06]: Half of the up arrow works and the back arrow doesn't work at all.

2017
02:46:21,855 --> 02:46:24,637
[SPEAKER_06]: Red Octane was all like, take it to a TV repairman.

2018
02:46:25,017 --> 02:46:26,278
[SPEAKER_06]: Problem being, I'm broke.

2019
02:46:26,598 --> 02:46:27,379
[SPEAKER_06]: Any suggestions?

2020
02:46:27,519 --> 02:46:29,020
[SPEAKER_06]: I've already disassembled and cleaned it.

2021
02:46:29,120 --> 02:46:29,821
[SPEAKER_06]: Same problems.

2022
02:46:30,121 --> 02:46:34,384
[SPEAKER_06]: The closest DDR machine is 40 minutes away on an interstate because Virginia's pretty lame.

2023
02:46:34,704 --> 02:46:35,585
[SPEAKER_06]: Help would be nice.

2024
02:46:35,985 --> 02:46:37,727
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Loki, you built your own metal pads before.

2025
02:46:37,767 --> 02:46:38,267
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think?

2026
02:46:38,307 --> 02:46:39,328
[SPEAKER_06]: TV repair, man.

2027
02:46:39,348 --> 02:46:39,908
[SPEAKER_06]: What the hell?

2028
02:46:39,928 --> 02:46:40,809
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not a TV.

2029
02:46:40,909 --> 02:46:41,510
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of weird.

2030
02:46:41,530 --> 02:46:42,230
[SPEAKER_05]: Send it back to them.

2031
02:46:42,250 --> 02:46:43,331
[SPEAKER_05]: It's their own fucking pad.

2032
02:46:43,351 --> 02:46:44,092
[SPEAKER_05]: They should fix it.

2033
02:46:44,272 --> 02:46:44,672
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

2034
02:46:45,493 --> 02:46:48,175
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, now, how do the sensors work in a metal pad?

2035
02:46:48,195 --> 02:46:48,895
[SPEAKER_06]: At least you can explain this.

2036
02:46:48,915 --> 02:46:50,016
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, a metal pad depends.

2037
02:46:50,197 --> 02:46:58,643
[SPEAKER_05]: Most likely, it's just going to be contacts in there, and if half the up arrow works or whatever, probably half the contacts or something broke or something or fell off.

2038
02:46:58,964 --> 02:47:00,605
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't really looked at their metal pads.

2039
02:47:00,725 --> 02:47:04,408
[SPEAKER_05]: I've taken apart crappy metal pads, and that's the way they work, but...

2040
02:47:05,540 --> 02:47:07,421
[SPEAKER_06]: How long has he had it?

2041
02:47:07,661 --> 02:47:08,481
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we don't know.

2042
02:47:08,841 --> 02:47:10,021
[SPEAKER_06]: I can ask how long he's had it.

2043
02:47:10,041 --> 02:47:15,163
[SPEAKER_05]: I would ask, I mean, honestly, if you buy it from Red Octane, isn't there some sort of return policy or something?

2044
02:47:15,183 --> 02:47:18,504
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you've got to assume it's past the return policy time, though, if he's asking this.

2045
02:47:18,604 --> 02:47:21,705
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, he says, out of warranty and yes, contacts.

2046
02:47:22,605 --> 02:47:28,047
[SPEAKER_06]: So, my first suggestion would be clean the contacts, and he says he's disassembled and cleaned it.

2047
02:47:28,107 --> 02:47:31,888
[SPEAKER_06]: So, does that just mean one of his contacts is broken and he's shit out of luck, or what?

2048
02:47:31,908 --> 02:47:33,008
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not necessarily contacts.

2049
02:47:33,048 --> 02:47:34,789
[SPEAKER_05]: It'd be a loose wire or something, also.

2050
02:47:35,453 --> 02:47:36,734
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm, that's a good thought too.

2051
02:47:38,255 --> 02:47:38,675
[SPEAKER_21]: What, Jonas?

2052
02:47:38,735 --> 02:47:39,395
[SPEAKER_21]: Give him a mic.

2053
02:47:40,476 --> 02:47:46,019
[SPEAKER_21]: Usually if you clean up the whole thing, usually it's not that case, because I've seen vendors actually try fixing this.

2054
02:47:46,719 --> 02:47:50,802
[SPEAKER_21]: You have to check if one of the wires is burnt or anything like that.

2055
02:47:52,423 --> 02:47:54,884
[SPEAKER_06]: So in what case is he absolutely screwed?

2056
02:47:54,944 --> 02:47:57,946
[SPEAKER_06]: How would this guy know if he's just screwed and he shouldn't even bother wasting his time?

2057
02:47:58,737 --> 02:48:01,980
[SPEAKER_06]: Because the shit could have just broke, and that's sad.

2058
02:48:02,520 --> 02:48:08,805
[SPEAKER_21]: I can't answer that question unless he tells you how long he has it, how many... Yeah, he says Christmas, he says.

2059
02:48:09,566 --> 02:48:12,088
[SPEAKER_21]: And how many times has he been playing the game, like how many songs?

2060
02:48:12,108 --> 02:48:16,191
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you can assume if there's no DDR machine nearby, it's probably quite a bit.

2061
02:48:17,279 --> 02:48:20,482
[SPEAKER_21]: All I can say is that they don't last that long.

2062
02:48:20,762 --> 02:48:28,289
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess the best answer we can come up with is that it sounds like you already kind of have an idea how to fix this thing because you've opened it up and you've cleaned it.

2063
02:48:28,609 --> 02:48:37,938
[SPEAKER_06]: There's probably not a whole lot else we could tell you except take a look at the wiring and make sure you don't have any loose connections going from the contacts to the actual, like,

2064
02:48:39,908 --> 02:48:42,570
[SPEAKER_06]: What do they call it where it all comes together towards the top?

2065
02:48:42,610 --> 02:48:42,891
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever.

2066
02:48:43,631 --> 02:48:54,860
[SPEAKER_06]: Check your wiring, but if a wire has shorted or burned out, there's really not a whole lot short of replacing the wire that you're going to be able to do, which is something you probably don't want to try doing yourself.

2067
02:48:55,940 --> 02:48:57,822
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, you don't want to waste too much time on it.

2068
02:48:57,842 --> 02:49:00,924
[SPEAKER_21]: Usually it's just to get a new pad because it's basically worn out.

2069
02:49:00,984 --> 02:49:02,585
[SPEAKER_21]: Wait, what games have you been playing, though?

2070
02:49:02,605 --> 02:49:04,227
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, assuming it's DDR, some...

2071
02:49:05,563 --> 02:49:08,686
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, like, there's DDR and In The Groove as well, that uses the same pads.

2072
02:49:08,746 --> 02:49:09,707
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, but it wouldn't matter.

2073
02:49:09,727 --> 02:49:11,729
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I can understand if In The Groove ruined those pads.

2074
02:49:11,749 --> 02:49:12,049
[SPEAKER_06]: Stop it.

2075
02:49:12,089 --> 02:49:12,970
[SPEAKER_06]: It's such a horrible game.

2076
02:49:13,050 --> 02:49:14,151
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, I can't take it!

2077
02:49:14,171 --> 02:49:14,492
[SPEAKER_06]: Stop it.

2078
02:49:15,773 --> 02:49:22,439
[SPEAKER_06]: He says he plays every day about three to four hours a day on heavy mode, so I think you've probably just beat that pad to death.

2079
02:49:23,040 --> 02:49:25,663
[SPEAKER_06]: The sad thing is, those red octane pads don't last forever.

2080
02:49:25,963 --> 02:49:30,067
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I mean, honestly, if it's just, like, a metal pad or something...

2081
02:49:30,745 --> 02:49:31,565
[SPEAKER_06]: The contact's in it.

2082
02:49:31,605 --> 02:49:34,186
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure there's ways that you can mod them and upgrade them.

2083
02:49:34,206 --> 02:49:39,827
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a whole thread on DDR Freak about modding, fixing, doing stuff to your metal pads.

2084
02:49:40,087 --> 02:49:40,807
[SPEAKER_06]: Just go there.

2085
02:49:41,167 --> 02:49:41,788
[SPEAKER_06]: Take a look there.

2086
02:49:41,908 --> 02:49:42,668
[SPEAKER_06]: Ask your question there.

2087
02:49:42,708 --> 02:49:44,388
[SPEAKER_06]: See if they can't help you over on the Freak.

2088
02:49:44,928 --> 02:49:49,609
[SPEAKER_06]: Otherwise, make Red Octane give you a better answer because that's a shitty answer they gave you.

2089
02:49:49,689 --> 02:49:53,910
[SPEAKER_06]: So you should email them again and tell them the people on the radio said that they gave you a shitty answer.

2090
02:49:54,491 --> 02:49:55,351
[SPEAKER_06]: Get that person fired.

2091
02:49:56,251 --> 02:49:57,231
[SPEAKER_06]: They can't say that, really.

2092
02:49:58,412 --> 02:49:59,972
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the best thing that we can give you guys.

2093
02:50:00,012 --> 02:50:00,252
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

2094
02:50:01,178 --> 02:50:07,004
[SPEAKER_06]: Acer 800 wants to know, who would win in an actual cage match?

2095
02:50:07,144 --> 02:50:09,486
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, DarkSakura, or me, Sky?

2096
02:50:10,968 --> 02:50:11,448
[SPEAKER_06]: Good question.

2097
02:50:11,468 --> 02:50:14,151
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, who would win in an actual cage match between the three of us?

2098
02:50:14,471 --> 02:50:14,772
[SPEAKER_14]: I would.

2099
02:50:14,972 --> 02:50:15,252
[SPEAKER_06]: Why?

2100
02:50:16,173 --> 02:50:21,859
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I exercise regularly, lift weights, and I've taken karate.

2101
02:50:22,900 --> 02:50:24,041
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got that killing urge.

2102
02:50:26,001 --> 02:50:28,102
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, but that's when you need to be sloppy and make mistakes.

2103
02:50:28,403 --> 02:50:30,444
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got a lot of smarts up here.

2104
02:50:30,624 --> 02:50:36,548
[SPEAKER_06]: I could... I'd make you... See, I would make Loki and DarkSakura beat up on each other while I just kind of watch.

2105
02:50:36,908 --> 02:50:37,188
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

2106
02:50:37,248 --> 02:50:38,549
[SPEAKER_06]: And then that way I save my strength.

2107
02:50:38,589 --> 02:50:40,390
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd use you as a bludgeoning tool.

2108
02:50:41,531 --> 02:50:42,352
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see about that one.

2109
02:50:43,634 --> 02:50:51,644
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly, Acer 800, we would not know the answer to that one unless we actually tried it, which maybe we'll do one of these days.

2110
02:50:53,065 --> 02:50:53,846
[SPEAKER_06]: As a rating stunt.

2111
02:50:58,951 --> 02:51:07,353
[SPEAKER_06]: Reznor wants to know, what's the status on the old school show?

2112
02:51:07,793 --> 02:51:11,334
[SPEAKER_06]: The old school show was supposed to launch a couple weeks ago, and I'm really sorry it hasn't happened yet.

2113
02:51:11,794 --> 02:51:17,236
[SPEAKER_06]: A decision was made on the staff that we want to make it not just 8-bit music, but 16-bit music as well.

2114
02:51:17,576 --> 02:51:22,957
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've just been so freaking busy that I haven't had the time to update the 16-bit music as well.

2115
02:51:23,517 --> 02:51:25,838
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to try and get on that this week, because...

2116
02:51:29,073 --> 02:51:30,373
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll keep you posted on that.

2117
02:51:30,533 --> 02:51:32,714
[SPEAKER_06]: I definitely want it to happen before summer's over.

2118
02:51:33,174 --> 02:51:37,136
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully before August gets here, so I will work just for you on the 16-bit stuff this week.

2119
02:51:37,676 --> 02:51:37,916
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay?

2120
02:51:38,936 --> 02:51:39,256
[SPEAKER_06]: Promise.

2121
02:51:40,757 --> 02:51:41,297
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, moving on.

2122
02:51:43,376 --> 02:51:47,057
[SPEAKER_06]: Socorino wants to know, can you make an mp3 of that Ask Orange Lounge song?

2123
02:51:47,497 --> 02:51:53,298
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, it's a song called Journey to the Wonderland by NPB, and it's in Keyboard Mania 2.

2124
02:51:53,999 --> 02:52:03,381
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want a clip of me actually singing it... Hey, I still have Bumblebee disguised voice mix.

2125
02:52:04,521 --> 02:52:05,981
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god, that's old.

2126
02:52:06,382 --> 02:52:08,082
[SPEAKER_14]: I think I played it like a couple weeks ago.

2127
02:52:08,732 --> 02:52:09,993
[SPEAKER_06]: That's very, very old.

2128
02:52:10,433 --> 02:52:11,954
[SPEAKER_06]: You actually played it on your show?

2129
02:52:12,974 --> 02:52:13,735
[SPEAKER_06]: Several times.

2130
02:52:13,895 --> 02:52:14,255
[SPEAKER_06]: Bitch.

2131
02:52:18,317 --> 02:52:22,480
[SPEAKER_06]: And Sakurina also wants to know if we could play the actual Silent Hill because I fucked up last break.

2132
02:52:22,500 --> 02:52:27,643
[SPEAKER_06]: He wanted to hear the actual song Silent Hill and not a song from Silent Hill.

2133
02:52:28,043 --> 02:52:28,683
[SPEAKER_06]: So my bad.

2134
02:52:29,204 --> 02:52:31,605
[SPEAKER_06]: We're running out of time on the show, so here's a clip.

2135
02:52:32,405 --> 02:52:34,887
I wish we could live

2136
02:52:39,105 --> 02:52:40,146
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, that's all you get, sorry.

2137
02:52:41,126 --> 02:52:41,967
[SPEAKER_06]: We're running short on time.

2138
02:52:45,528 --> 02:52:47,569
[SPEAKER_06]: Tomokun wanted to make a point, just to follow up.

2139
02:52:47,649 --> 02:52:50,671
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, Parapara Dancer did have sensors on the back as well.

2140
02:52:50,991 --> 02:52:58,495
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's why Parapara Paradise didn't have the 180 mode, because they didn't have sensors on the back.

2141
02:52:58,855 --> 02:53:01,176
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably a cost-cutting thing, honestly.

2142
02:53:01,296 --> 02:53:02,397
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my best answer.

2143
02:53:05,231 --> 02:53:11,572
[SPEAKER_06]: Neo Dude wants to know, what do you guys think about the Konami Red Octane Rocksaur Madcatz lawsuit?

2144
02:53:11,592 --> 02:53:13,953
[SPEAKER_06]: Didn't we talk about that a few weeks ago?

2145
02:53:13,973 --> 02:53:16,353
[SPEAKER_06]: We kind of did talk about it a few weeks ago on the show.

2146
02:53:16,393 --> 02:53:19,174
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to assume that we've got a new listener on our hands, which is cool.

2147
02:53:19,474 --> 02:53:20,414
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, welcome to the show.

2148
02:53:20,474 --> 02:53:20,934
[SPEAKER_06]: Hope you enjoy.

2149
02:53:22,615 --> 02:53:27,796
[SPEAKER_06]: But there have been, you know, a few recent developments, and you know, the chat can sometimes sway your mind.

2150
02:53:28,096 --> 02:53:29,096
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think, Loki?

2151
02:53:29,136 --> 02:53:30,616
[SPEAKER_06]: What's your latest perspective on this?

2152
02:53:30,736 --> 02:53:31,996
[SPEAKER_06]: Although I already know what you're going to say.

2153
02:53:32,777 --> 02:53:34,377
[SPEAKER_05]: My latest perspective on this is,

2154
02:53:34,810 --> 02:53:43,573
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, Konami's within their rights, you know, to do this because, you know, these companies are making, you know, crappy games and, um, well, not necessarily crappy games.

2155
02:53:44,113 --> 02:53:47,574
[SPEAKER_05]: They're making games that obviously are too much like DDR.

2156
02:53:47,714 --> 02:53:51,955
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they're just trying to, like, kind of get people like, oh, hey, you like DDR?

2157
02:53:51,975 --> 02:53:54,976
[SPEAKER_06]: Then you'll like this almost like DDR game.

2158
02:53:55,957 --> 02:54:02,018
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um, you know, when it comes down to it, it's just an inferior product, just like those Apple products.

2159
02:54:02,238 --> 02:54:02,659
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um...

2160
02:54:04,622 --> 02:54:13,073
[SPEAKER_06]: You know that they were having a huge debate in the chat room before this started and it simmered down and I was hoping they would shut up already about the Apple vs. PC thing.

2161
02:54:13,393 --> 02:54:17,399
[SPEAKER_06]: But no, you had to go in over your big fat mouth and bring up the Apple thing again.

2162
02:54:17,419 --> 02:54:19,081
[SPEAKER_14]: This is because you don't know how to use it.

2163
02:54:19,141 --> 02:54:19,742
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

2164
02:54:19,902 --> 02:54:20,463
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, that's right.

2165
02:54:21,124 --> 02:54:21,304
[SPEAKER_14]: On!

2166
02:54:21,344 --> 02:54:22,545
[SPEAKER_14]: Where's your on button?

2167
02:54:23,146 --> 02:54:24,288
[SPEAKER_07]: How do I upgrade this thing?

2168
02:54:24,368 --> 02:54:24,768
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's right.

2169
02:54:24,788 --> 02:54:25,530
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all built together.

2170
02:54:25,610 --> 02:54:26,992
[SPEAKER_06]: Stop it.

2171
02:54:27,312 --> 02:54:27,633
[SPEAKER_06]: Stop it.

2172
02:54:27,733 --> 02:54:28,894
[SPEAKER_06]: I've upgraded Max before.

2173
02:54:29,075 --> 02:54:34,402
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody wanted me to point out that there is a... Now I don't have the exact thing, but I'm sure somebody will...

2174
02:54:35,645 --> 02:54:51,523
[SPEAKER_14]: I have opened up Macs before and changed out their memory, changed out the hard drives, put in new graphics cards.

2175
02:54:51,763 --> 02:54:54,386
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, you can upgrade a Mac the same way you can a PC.

2176
02:54:55,147 --> 02:54:56,789
[SPEAKER_05]: No matter what you do, they're still inferior.

2177
02:54:58,386 --> 02:54:59,547
[SPEAKER_14]: and you're talking out of your ass.

2178
02:54:59,567 --> 02:55:01,448
[SPEAKER_06]: Can't we just all get along?

2179
02:55:01,548 --> 02:55:06,751
[SPEAKER_14]: Isn't there room for... As soon as he stops talking out of his ass and actually talks about something he knows about, maybe.

2180
02:55:07,051 --> 02:55:17,118
[SPEAKER_21]: Wait, now that we're on the contrary with Konami, Rockstar, and Red Octane Madcast, what would happen with this Neon FM game since... It's nothing like DDR.

2181
02:55:17,198 --> 02:55:17,618
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why.

2182
02:55:18,878 --> 02:55:23,282
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll tell you what's... That's the only thing I'm thinking about since, you know, like the Konami thing.

2183
02:55:23,462 --> 02:55:24,623
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's my perspective with it.

2184
02:55:24,663 --> 02:55:28,667
[SPEAKER_06]: As long as Neon FM doesn't try to invade the home markets, they'll be fine.

2185
02:55:28,767 --> 02:55:31,970
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I think they're going to be fine anyways because they've been working with actually Konami on this.

2186
02:55:32,010 --> 02:55:35,173
[SPEAKER_06]: They've actually flown the people in or whatever and had them look at the game.

2187
02:55:35,433 --> 02:55:38,435
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully though, hopefully though, they're not just feeding us BS with that.

2188
02:55:38,755 --> 02:55:45,220
[SPEAKER_06]: Because the In The Groove team said, shut up, we know it's legal, and now here you go.

2189
02:55:45,540 --> 02:55:58,890
[SPEAKER_06]: But honestly, looking at the gameplay of this game, it is quite different from, I mean, the setup of the pads are different, the gameplay looks different, it's got just really different stuff in it, so I don't think they're going to be really in

2190
02:55:59,626 --> 02:56:05,350
[SPEAKER_06]: Fringing Out, whereas In The Groove looks like DDR just with different shaped arrows.

2191
02:56:05,491 --> 02:56:07,452
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's pretty much the same damn game.

2192
02:56:07,532 --> 02:56:13,556
[SPEAKER_06]: And honestly, the Mad Catz game was just a shitty game in general and brought everybody down, so it just needed a spanking, basically.

2193
02:56:14,877 --> 02:56:20,602
[SPEAKER_21]: That's the only question I have with what happened to Neon FM, because everyone's saying, ooh, it's Beatmania on feet.

2194
02:56:21,482 --> 02:56:25,225
[SPEAKER_21]: But then again, I think as long as they aren't

2195
02:56:27,089 --> 02:56:36,318
[SPEAKER_06]: I think as long as it's different enough from DDR with the foot layout and everything in there, in-game layout appears to be very different, I think they'll be okay, just like Pump It Up's okay.

2196
02:56:36,338 --> 02:56:38,961
[SPEAKER_06]: But of course you have that whole lawsuit thing, but whatever.

2197
02:56:39,061 --> 02:56:48,851
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, long story short, what I believe, what's going on with this lawsuit, In The Groove should have never tried to come out for the home systems because it awoke the Konami sleeping giant, and that's what's happening now.

2198
02:56:49,929 --> 02:56:51,992
[SPEAKER_21]: What anime slash video game character would you all cosplay and why?

2199
02:57:05,652 --> 02:57:07,913
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, you actually do cosplay, so I should start with you.

2200
02:57:07,933 --> 02:57:10,014
[SPEAKER_14]: I've never actually cosplayed a character from Anonymy.

2201
02:57:11,275 --> 02:57:12,935
[SPEAKER_14]: I've cosplayed a character from a manga.

2202
02:57:13,856 --> 02:57:16,137
[SPEAKER_14]: I went as Mad Hatter from Sanctuary.

2203
02:57:18,698 --> 02:57:26,241
[SPEAKER_14]: I've also cosplayed Baiken from Guilty Gear X. Dan didn't like that because I didn't have anything to hold my boobs up.

2204
02:57:29,062 --> 02:57:31,543
[SPEAKER_14]: I've cosplayed Jill from Resident Evil.

2205
02:57:33,574 --> 02:57:49,827
[SPEAKER_14]: I've, I actually still have that costume, I've cosplayed Emi, uh, as in 3rd Mix DDR, uh, who else have I done, oh yeah, Shorty from Bustin' Move 2, um, I really don't know, and I've been trying to think of who I would, um, Leona from,

2206
02:57:50,647 --> 02:58:08,027
[SPEAKER_14]: I've done Leona The costume is actually three sizes too big for me now Take that back, four sizes too big for me now So it's officially retired I was working on doing Richter Belmont from Dracula X

2207
02:58:10,352 --> 02:58:16,895
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to do one from an anime, I just don't know who, although it's been suggested to do Hyatt from Exosaga.

2208
02:58:17,955 --> 02:58:22,497
[SPEAKER_14]: But I don't want to do that outfit, and I don't want to carry around fake blood and cough.

2209
02:58:23,277 --> 02:58:25,998
[SPEAKER_06]: I went as Ash Ketchum one year for Halloween, does that count?

2210
02:58:27,779 --> 02:58:28,439
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate that name.

2211
02:58:28,499 --> 02:58:29,440
[SPEAKER_06]: I love Pokemon.

2212
02:58:30,180 --> 02:58:31,340
[SPEAKER_14]: You're watching the American Craft.

2213
02:58:31,360 --> 02:58:33,101
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking of that, I am watching the American Craft.

2214
02:58:33,121 --> 02:58:36,502
[SPEAKER_21]: I've seen a shitload of Pokemon trainers up in Anime Expo.

2215
02:58:36,522 --> 02:58:40,704
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, somebody start a thread on the Orange Lunch forums that should I cosplay.

2216
02:58:41,024 --> 02:58:42,244
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki, what would you cosplay as?

2217
02:58:42,484 --> 02:58:43,545
[SPEAKER_06]: Gendo the Uber Pimp.

2218
02:58:45,706 --> 02:58:46,026
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright.

2219
02:58:46,086 --> 02:58:49,247
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's see, I'll probably cosplay as Bronco for next year.

2220
02:58:49,407 --> 02:58:51,608
[SPEAKER_14]: I am not cosplaying as Noodle, thank you.

2221
02:58:51,628 --> 02:58:53,988
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know, that would be fun.

2222
02:58:54,008 --> 02:58:58,010
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh yeah, we get some body paint and do something for the masquerade for Anime Expo.

2223
02:59:00,419 --> 02:59:01,459
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, no.

2224
02:59:01,480 --> 02:59:02,000
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, God.

2225
02:59:02,240 --> 02:59:04,301
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we have another really good question from the chat room.

2226
02:59:04,361 --> 02:59:08,042
[SPEAKER_06]: Illusion wants to know, what does Loki think about do-it-yourself abortion kits?

2227
02:59:08,542 --> 02:59:09,223
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so much fun.

2228
02:59:09,423 --> 02:59:09,983
[SPEAKER_06]: It's great.

2229
02:59:14,204 --> 02:59:15,285
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll never get old, Loki.

2230
02:59:16,645 --> 02:59:17,866
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but you've got to clip it out.

2231
02:59:19,427 --> 02:59:23,668
[SPEAKER_06]: And Tomokun would like to point out, Loki, a Power Mac, it's like a PC.

2232
02:59:23,748 --> 02:59:25,409
[SPEAKER_06]: They are 100% upgradable.

2233
02:59:27,190 --> 02:59:28,210
[SPEAKER_06]: From shit to crap.

2234
02:59:29,258 --> 02:59:29,879
[SPEAKER_06]: Stop it!

2235
02:59:29,959 --> 02:59:31,280
[SPEAKER_06]: You are... You know what?

2236
02:59:31,420 --> 02:59:35,144
[SPEAKER_06]: For your birthday, I'm buying you a gift certificate to the Apple Store.

2237
02:59:35,384 --> 02:59:36,906
[SPEAKER_06]: And I will set it on fire.

2238
02:59:36,926 --> 02:59:38,047
[SPEAKER_06]: You could just suffer.

2239
02:59:38,928 --> 02:59:40,129
[SPEAKER_06]: You will have to find something you like.

2240
02:59:40,169 --> 02:59:46,335
[SPEAKER_05]: I will buy... If you give me enough money to buy an iPod, I will buy enough... Buy an iPod, and I will take a sledgehammer to it.

2241
02:59:46,555 --> 02:59:48,157
[SPEAKER_05]: I... And then I will sell it.

2242
02:59:48,177 --> 02:59:49,198
[SPEAKER_05]: You're just a bastard.

2243
02:59:50,259 --> 02:59:51,160
[SPEAKER_06]: I love my iPod.

2244
02:59:51,220 --> 02:59:52,161
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like the best thing ever.

2245
02:59:53,851 --> 03:00:02,418
[SPEAKER_06]: They said, I am a little upset because my roommate just bought an iPod and he paid the same price for his that I paid for mine, but because he bought his six months later, he got a color one.

2246
03:00:03,399 --> 03:00:05,201
[SPEAKER_10]: Bastard.

2247
03:00:05,841 --> 03:00:08,083
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, that's going to do it for Ask Orange Lounge.

2248
03:00:08,103 --> 03:00:10,365
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you guys for submitting your questions.

2249
03:00:11,246 --> 03:00:12,207
[SPEAKER_06]: And now, it's 9.30.

2250
03:00:12,327 --> 03:00:13,648
[SPEAKER_06]: It's time to end the show.

2251
03:00:15,329 --> 03:00:16,170
[SPEAKER_06]: Final thought time.

2252
03:00:17,291 --> 03:00:18,472
[SPEAKER_06]: Explicit, your final thought.

2253
03:00:19,690 --> 03:00:22,311
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, it's nice to meet you guys again.

2254
03:00:23,051 --> 03:00:24,091
[SPEAKER_21]: Just like the good old times.

2255
03:00:24,151 --> 03:00:25,511
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad you found the new house okay.

2256
03:00:25,751 --> 03:00:32,813
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, that too, and I finally got a chance to come over here to introduce the tournament, finally, since I've been so busy.

2257
03:00:34,493 --> 03:00:37,634
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, there's a tournament that's in July 30th, this Saturday.

2258
03:00:37,654 --> 03:00:45,536
[SPEAKER_21]: DDRPA and Freestyle, and it is a possibility that newspaper journalists will come in for, like, Sacramento Bee.

2259
03:00:46,423 --> 03:00:48,284
[SPEAKER_21]: And don't forget, there's Lumpia and Ice Cream.

2260
03:00:48,364 --> 03:00:49,565
[SPEAKER_06]: And you might get your foot in the paper.

2261
03:00:49,585 --> 03:00:50,245
[SPEAKER_21]: Mmm, Lumpia.

2262
03:00:50,385 --> 03:00:51,366
[SPEAKER_06]: Mmm, Lumpia, I agree.

2263
03:00:51,686 --> 03:00:52,847
[SPEAKER_21]: Say again, what about my foot?

2264
03:00:53,347 --> 03:00:54,928
[SPEAKER_06]: You might get your foot in the paper, just like Loki did.

2265
03:00:56,388 --> 03:00:59,290
[SPEAKER_06]: If Sac B comes out, because you know Loki's foot was in the Sac B, playing DDR.

2266
03:00:59,910 --> 03:01:00,391
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, wow.

2267
03:01:00,871 --> 03:01:01,851
[SPEAKER_06]: Have fun at the tournament.

2268
03:01:01,931 --> 03:01:04,533
[SPEAKER_06]: That'll be at Paradise Island in Sacramento, California.

2269
03:01:04,733 --> 03:01:05,353
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, indeed.

2270
03:01:06,114 --> 03:01:07,454
[SPEAKER_21]: In addition to a Super Smash Bros.

2271
03:01:07,495 --> 03:01:09,015
[SPEAKER_21]: meetup for those who are interested in that.

2272
03:01:09,376 --> 03:01:11,817
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll just do, you know my strategy at Super Smash Bros.

2273
03:01:11,877 --> 03:01:12,937
[SPEAKER_06]: is to just play as Ness.

2274
03:01:13,178 --> 03:01:13,918
[SPEAKER_18]: PK Fire!

2275
03:01:14,058 --> 03:01:14,778
[SPEAKER_18]: PK Fire!

2276
03:01:14,899 --> 03:01:15,579
[SPEAKER_06]: PK Fire!

2277
03:01:16,724 --> 03:01:17,104
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki!

2278
03:01:18,005 --> 03:01:18,626
[SPEAKER_06]: Your final thought.

2279
03:01:20,088 --> 03:01:24,713
[SPEAKER_05]: I just unlocked the third picture in Peek-A-Boo Poker, in which Xylox said... No, wait, no.

2280
03:01:25,814 --> 03:01:29,458
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, what are you guys doing out there while you're watching my moves?

2281
03:01:30,239 --> 03:01:31,020
[SPEAKER_05]: What the hell does that mean?

2282
03:01:31,040 --> 03:01:31,600
[SPEAKER_05]: That's retarded.

2283
03:01:31,680 --> 03:01:33,562
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think that's what the fanboys are watching.

2284
03:01:34,624 --> 03:01:34,804
[SPEAKER_05]: See?

2285
03:01:35,565 --> 03:01:35,885
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.

2286
03:01:36,446 --> 03:01:37,547
[SPEAKER_06]: My final thought is...

2287
03:01:38,194 --> 03:01:44,758
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm craving dinner because I haven't eaten like a real meal yet today and you guys ate all those chicken nuggets and didn't save me one.

2288
03:01:45,278 --> 03:01:47,199
[SPEAKER_06]: And I ate the two barbecue sauce packets.

2289
03:01:47,739 --> 03:01:47,859
[SPEAKER_06]: Ew.

2290
03:01:48,239 --> 03:01:49,520
[SPEAKER_13]: I bought cheese and cherries.

2291
03:01:51,141 --> 03:01:56,464
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, I hope you go home and find all your computers that were replaced with Macs.

2292
03:01:57,184 --> 03:01:58,365
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, your final thought.

2293
03:01:59,826 --> 03:02:00,946
[SPEAKER_14]: Reject false icons.

2294
03:02:01,687 --> 03:02:03,668
[SPEAKER_14]: And somebody buy me that 2D shirt at Hot Topic.

2295
03:02:05,063 --> 03:02:09,644
[SPEAKER_06]: The final word of the show, one word to sum it all up, since we actually have a special guest tonight, I'll give it to him.

2296
03:02:10,604 --> 03:02:14,645
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, next week on Orange Haunts Radio, are we taking a vacation for two weeks?

2297
03:02:15,866 --> 03:02:16,226
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe.

2298
03:02:16,606 --> 03:02:17,526
