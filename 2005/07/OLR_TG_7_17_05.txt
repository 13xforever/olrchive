Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
Hello, everybody out there in podcast land, and welcome to another edition of the Orange Lounge Radio To Go show, video game radio.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
That's a good description.
Has the fan mail perked you up at all?
You get more fan mail than any of us.
You know what?
Wait, did you see that?
She just perked up.
All of a sudden, she's full of life.
She's like, yay!
Fan mail.
Well, I have this sort of complex about myself where I'm like...
Eh, that's nice, but I don't deserve it, you know?
You do, though.
You're a good gal.
I can't be the diva all the time.
I have to be modest on occasion.
Maybe I want to be the diva, dammit.
Somebody send me a fan letter.
You can't be the diva.
Oh, girl.
There could be only one.
There could be only one.
Yeah, I'm going to be the diva just tonight.
I'm kind of... All right.
How's the new Harry Potter book going for you?
I'm about halfway through it right now.
Dang, you people read that book very fast.
I haven't had a whole bunch of time to read it.
This is only actually the equivalent of four hours reading.
Wow.
So which Harry Potter book does he go through puberty?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Quidditch Quidditch, whatever, Quidditch, Quidditch I thought it was kind of crap But I played one where Harry was just kind of walking around I think it was Azkaban, I don't remember But it was kind of cool, it was okay I kind of like exploring all the places and doing the stuff I just wish, you know what would be cool?
It would be like an MMORPG For the Harry Potter universe You know it'll happen I will be on that so fast We're going to talk about another MMO potential For lots of fanboys and girls tonight on the show
All right.
What?
What?
You're thinking the Oregon Trail thing, aren't you?
Oregon Trail, the MMORPG.
It's a reference to our three-hour show earlier this evening.
Which you should all be listening to as well.
One of our callers brought up Oregon Trail, the MMO.
It should be a great idea.
We're going to start an online petition and everything, so we'll see.
Speaking of online things, did you know that we got nominated for the Podcast Awards?
www.podcastawards.com Best Gaming Podcast.
How do you like that?
That's because we're very special.
Pretty cool.
I'm very happy about that.

So go take a look.
Vote often, vote daily
What games have you been playing this week, DarkSakura?
Hardly any.
I played PSO once, and that's really about it.
Oh, no, I played Guitar Man today on my 50-inch widescreen HDTV.
It was like my entire range of vision was Guitar Man, and I suck at that game.
The Parapara level kicked my ass, and it's only the second level.
Guitaroman is a very strange music game.
It's very different.
The analog, like, in Guitaroman, of course, you're trying to play the guitar, and there's this one point where you move the analog stick very carefully, and you try to trace the pattern.
It's harder than you'd think.
At least for me, but maybe I just have a fat thumb or something.
It's my first time actually playing the game, and I've owned it for two years.
Wow.
I unwrapped it last year.
Thank you for watching!
Namco Battle Collection I've been testing out, which has been pretty cool.
Definitely got all your retro favorites in there, plus the remade ones are really nice.
Like the remade ones from the early 90s?
Like Pac-Man and Rally-X and stuff they had in the arcades?
No, these weren't in the arcades.
These were made specifically for the PSP.
They're really nice, they look pretty, and they play well.
So that's good.
I like retro upgrades.
I always liked Mario Lost Levels.
Or not Mario...
Mario All-Stars
It's with a K. Okay, good.
K-O-L-L-O-N.
Oh, good.
Because I could just see those chips.
I've been playing Colon, and it was pretty cool, and I've been trying that out and stuff.
Wait, wait, so a puzzle game you like on PSP?
Yeah.
Imagine that.
There's really a lot of puzzle games coming out.
We got bashed on Mercury and Smart Bomb, so... Well, Mercury sucked, and Smart Bomb was not even finished.
You know, whatever.
I mean, they just sucked.
But anyways...
I've been trying those, and then playing a little bit of Coated Arms and stuff, and it was pretty fun.
So, yeah, just trying out the PSP games and stuff, whatever I can get my hands on.
Well, go figure.
While Loki's been playing PSP, I've been playing DS.
I played two new DS games this week.
First one I checked out was Puyo Puyo, the new DS version of Puyo Puyo, which it kind of did... For those of you guys that have played Puyo Puyo before, you might have played it and not even known it, because it was called...
Sonic, or no, Dr. Robotnik's Magic Bean Machine on Genesis, and then on Super Nintendo, it was Kirby's Avalanche.
Woo, I remembered.
Kirby's Avalanche.
Both of them were just different versions of Puyo Puyo.
Well, they have this game now in its original kind of Japanese anime form on the DS, but they kind of changed the game a little bit.
They changed some of the mechanics, like they put fat pieces in them, like pieces that would usually be like, think of Super Gems from Puzzle Fighter 2.
That fall, like big red, they're like 2x2s, they're just like fat red pieces and stuff, you know, different colors So they changed some of the game mechanics, you know, keep it a little bit fresh Some of the rest of the game, though, is a little bit dorky Like they have the cutscenes where they're talking to each other and it's all anime style So they're all like cute little girls talking like this Except they talk very slow when they do their talking
so you know you're like sitting waiting waiting and it's kind of like why is it in a lot of these games when they're talking to each other back and forth they don't talk normally they slow down their speech like they're reading it line by line why is that so I don't know
Puyo Puyo
Loving this.
The new DS games are starting to be eight-player games off of one cartridge.
Bomberman, Meteos, not necessarily eight players, but four, you know.
Loving that.
So I'm very happy to report that Puyo Puyo does the multi-player off one cartridge as well.
That's great.
Also, another DS game I checked out this week was Kirby's Canvas Curse, which has actually been out for about a month now, but I got it for my birthday.
Thank you, Loki.
I have to admit, I didn't want to play this game at first because I had a bad feeling it was going to be like Yoshi Touch and Go, which if you listened to earlier podcasts, I did not like Yoshi Touch and Go.
I thought it was way too...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
You will like Kirby's Canvas Curse because there's way more interactivity and there's so many different levels and things to unlock.
And if you're a Kirby fan, you're going to like it because it has the old music and the cute graphics.
But please note, this does not play like a normal Kirby game.
That's one thing you want to keep in mind.
It's Kirby Canvas Curse and basically Kirby sort of moves automatically and you can touch him with a stylus to make him roll faster or if he's killed an enemy, you can use the power like if you hit one of the stone guys, then tapping on Kirby will make him turn into a stone.
but it doesn't function like the other ones.
You don't suck in the enemies using your breath like you did in the old Kirby games.
It doesn't quite have that same gameplay element.
The gameplay is much different because you're drawing paths for Kirby to take, which I know sounds very simple, but it's actually kind of complicated and the level design is pretty smart in the game.
So I guess that's kind of my review.
If you like Kirby the character, you'll like this game.
If you like Kirby the actual game,
You may want to rent or borrow this one first to make sure that the mechanics of the game are going to be something you enjoy.
But if you liked Touch and Go, you're going to like this one.
So that's my thought on Kirby Canvas Curse.
I forgot to mention, I also played one more game called Glow Race Fantastic Carnival.
It's some racing game that's in Korea for the PSP.
I don't like it.
It was lame.
I'm sorry to hear that.
It's like a cheap version of Mario Kart that's not even close to being Mario Kart and just lame.
I can't wait for Mario Kart DS, though.
You know Mario Kart DS and Animal Crossing DS are going to have the online thing.
At least that's what they're saying right now.
I hope so.
I can't wait for that.
Well, you know it's going to happen.
They were showing it off at E3.
But what's interesting is that 1UP.com ran a story this week about Metroid Prime Hunters not having the online capability.
And just kind of, why didn't, you know, because this game's been delayed and delayed over and over again.
Why didn't they bother to add in the online capability?
Because think about it.
Metroid Prime Hunters would have been a lot of fun online.
And there's some quotes in the articles here.
The producer of the game, Kensuke Tanabe, says, Really, we could have made this game online, but Nintendo's version of online play is different from that of other companies.
We wanted it to be free, easy, and easy to access for everybody.
To set up the kind of infrastructure that we needed, and to meet the launch date we have for this game, the two just didn't match.
And that makes me think, what was the launch date for this game?
Because, dang, it's been like a year since the DS came out.
Well, okay, maybe not quite that long.
It feels like a year.
In reality, it's probably been, what, eight months or so since DS came out?
And Prime Hunters was the built-in demo, and I would think that the built-in demo would be the game that would be coming out within the first three months.
Unless it was just one hell of a teaser.
That's what it basically ended up being.
And of course, then they kind of, you know, try to soften the blow here about Metroid Prime Hunters not being online.
Richard Verrotti, game designer over at Nintendo, says, I don't think we look at it as a negative thing because we're not focusing on the internet.
We've got to focus on the Wi-Fi stuff so four players can jump in like that.
And if only one person has the game, well, you can download it too and then play with your friends.
I think it's going to be the perfect multiplayer game because of that.
and I'll give them points for that.
I do like the fact on the DS you really get to sample a lot of games because it seems to be this running trend in a lot of games where you can play off of one cartridge and that at least is cool.
But the internet thing would have been cool.
I would have liked to play some of our podcast listeners on the internet.
Metroid Maker
Oh, like make your own?
Someone had done a map editor for Metroid, and someone has actually made a Metroid game out of it.
Like a ROM hack thing?
Sort of.
That's cool.
I love Super Metroid.
I did not get into the 3D Metroids as much, but I love the DS one.
For some reason, the 3D thing works for me on that.
I don't know why.
It doesn't look nearly as good as it does on GameCube, but for some reason, I like it.
I don't know what it is.
Go figure.
Alright, so what do you guys think?
Online play on DS?
Something that more games should be looking at doing?
Let's see how these early ones do first before we start going.
Let's get more online play because if it's going to suck, then no.
Alright.
We got a couple letters tonight sent to us via togo at orangeloungeradio.com.
That's T-O-G-O at orangeloungeradio.com.
So I thought we'd read a couple letters.
Unfortunately, we're getting a lot of mail, so we don't have time to answer everything.
But DarkSakura, she does check that mailbox.
I'd reply to my mailbox, but all I'm getting is spam.
You need breast enhancement.
Apparently I do, because there's a lot of people sending me that info.
I still like that one webcomic you linked me to, Rob.
Spamusement.
That's hilarious.
I love Spamusement.
Seriously, I think it's the best webcomic out there.
And it's so simple.
Spamusement.com gets my full endorsement.
I love that site.
Alright, let's open up the mailbag.
Let's see.
We got a fan letter here.
I'm going to read the Loki fan letter here.
This was from Same.
Same says he was catching up on some of the old podcasts while cleaning up around my room, and I was listening to the July 4th podcast, and I must say the following words.
I loved it.
I am so serious.
Loki was hilarious, and I couldn't stop laughing every time he spoke.
Do it some more.
Seriously, guys.
That game was awful.
Seriously.
Seriously.
It was really awful.
Seriously, it was awful.
Loki, next time he drinks, he's going to be under strict monitoring when he drinks.
He barfed on the carpet.
It was disgusting.
I had 20 shots of vodka.
I mean, what do you expect?
You need to be babysat next time you get drunk.
I thought it was a single shot glass.
Drink responsibly, boys and girls.
I didn't even think about it.
Alright, let's get to another letter here.
This one is from... Does this person have a handle?
I couldn't see it in here.
Sorry if you had a handle and I missed it.
This is from Brett, and Brett wants to know, I played Silent Hill 1 and 2.
I thought the second game was one of the best games available at the time.
I absolutely love Silent Hill 2, and then Silent Hill 3 popped its ugly head.
I wasn't feeling the 17-year-old life-vesting wearing chick, and the game was a bit boring to me.
I think I played about two hours of it.
My question is, Silent Hill 4, is it worth checking out?
I know that the movie is coming out soon.
It's been a hot topic on the show.
So Silent Hill 4 is the only one of the series I haven't played yet.
Should I give it a whirl?
That's from Brett.
What do you guys think?
Definitely.
Definitely.
You think so?
It's pretty good.
What do you think, DarkSakura?
You've had my copy of Silent Hill 4.
I hope you've played it.
Well, I have my own copy.
I thought I gave you yours back.
I don't know.
Well, I'll find it sometime when I unpack.
That's cool.
What do you think, though?
Would you recommend Silent Hill 4?
Well, yeah.
First of all, in my response that I had given back, I would say I told them to try Silent Hill 3 all the way through because it really does get a lot better.
But Silent Hill 4 is definitely from a male perspective and it's very, I think, unique to the series.
Very cool.
I would definitely recommend Silent Hill 4.
To be honest, I haven't even really played Silent Hill 3.
I'm liking it.
I really like Silent Hill 3.
Silent Hill 4 is a continuation of the story from Silent Hill 2, so I don't see how it could really be a miss.
I love the soundtrack especially.
The soundtrack, I think, is one of the best parts of the whole game.
That's what I love about it.
At least rent it.
Do yourself a favor, rent it.
I think the idea of renting games is really great, so definitely check that out.
All right, and then one other letter we got from Mark.
And Mark actually lives in the UK and sent us a really great email.
It was so great, but it was kind of long, so I can't read the whole thing.
But it's a follow-up to last week's podcast.
Remember how we were talking about the rating system?
And I said that they should do it like they do the movies.
Well, in here, Mark writes, well, this is how it's done in the UK to an extent.
Game ratings in most of Europe are given out by the Pan-European Gaming Information, that's www.pegi.info, with ratings including 3+, 7+, 12, 16, and 18 printed on the boxes for each game, and often also accompanied by icons to describe the reasons for these ratings.
Although I don't believe the ratings are legally binding, retailers do tend to enforce the 16 and 18 ratings.
Also, most retailers will not stock a game without a PEGI rating,
Although, again, I don't think there's a legal requirement for them to do so.
and then went on to say the ratings tend to be quite effective as the 15 and 18 ratings have been used on movies for a very long time so parents recognize the logos and understand the reasons for these ratings although then he linked us to an article that said that maybe the studies don't quite link up to that and then they were talking about, Mark was talking about the hysteria regarding hysteria about violent games in the UK a notable recent case involved a boy 14 getting murdered by an older teenager
It was reported that the older teenager had been inspired to kill the younger child by the gay Manhunt.
Very interesting to hear the UK perspective.
And then Mark ends his letter by saying, maybe everyone would be more mellow if Katamari Damacy ever came out over here.
And I didn't even realize that game wasn't out over there.
Neither did I. You need that game.
You guys need that game.
Import that stuff or something.
Well, I don't think they can because of the television difference, but... Hey, you know what?
A lot of TVs come out now able to switch between PAL and NTSC.
Figure out a way to do it.
You guys need that game.
You're right.
People would mellow out if they could play some Katamari Damacy.
Play it on a computer monitor.
No problem on a computer monitor.
All right.
Thank you very much, Mark, for your mail.
It was very nice.
I like getting the long mails.
It really shows they listen to us.
It's great.
All right.
So we're going to close up the mail bag again.
If you guys have an email, togo at orangelaunchradio.com.
The PlayStation 2 version of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, it was confirmed by GameSpot that it does have the hot coffee content.
So that's interesting because as we were saying last week, you have to mod your game to do this.
But apparently a sequence of codes have been discovered or something that will actually unlock this in the PlayStation 2 version of the game, which kind of goes, well, now is this a case of Rockstar was just lazy and didn't take the code out?
No.
Well, apparently it could be like, you know, the code pointing to it or whatever could be like, you know, truncated out or something like that.
Like, they just put one code in there to patch, you know, to rewrite the code.
I mean, I don't see how they're guilty for having this code in there if it's disabled.
I mean, there's a lot of things that can be disabled in a game.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
And I can't say I blame them 100% because not everybody's a gamer, and I don't think there's any senators that are video gamers, although if there are, that would be cool, and I would vote for them.
She probably thinks that, you know, Bill Clinton slept with Monica.
Now, wait a minute, wait a minute.
Because he saw the whores in, you know, Grand Theft Auto.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute, it has nothing to do with it.
Does it?
I think people are thinking that this is actually in the game and was something hidden by the people who coded it as some type of secret feature.
But that really doesn't seem to be the case when you look into it.
Oh, but do they do the research?
No!
That's the problem.
I think that's why this whole thing is blown out of proportion.
I don't think people have been doing the appropriate research.
and I'm hoping that that is the investigation they're going to do and that's what they're going to find out because what they want to find out did Rockstar release this game knowing that they were...
Marketing this as a mature game when it should have been adults only because this would be unlocked by somebody.
And I'm saying no.
Some hacker went and figured out a way to do it.
And Rockstar was under the impression that that wouldn't happen because they had removed the code that points to the hot coffee mug.
And did they?
I don't know.
Thank you for watching!
They want to see everything censored and everything, you know, hunky-dory Christian.
What I don't understand, this is something, you know, if you think about it, M would be like an R rating on a movie, right?
Because AO would be like the NC-17 rating, right?
And they want to say that this hot coffee mod should earn this game an adults-only rating.
But, my God, have you seen sex scenes in how many R-rated movies?
I mean, should that really qualify this game for an AO rating?
Granted...
Maybe I myself am being a little ignorant here because I have not seen the mod myself, but I'm assuming how bad can it be?
It's pixelated, for God's sake.
How bad can it be?
You know?
I don't know.
Well, it is pretty graphic, but it's not too graphic to the point where I'd say it'd be... Are there money shots?
No, there's...
There's pixelated boobies.
But still, look at God of War.
There's a sex minigame in that game.
And there's boobies that are not pixelated.
They're out there saying, hello.
And he basically says, hey, thanks to this group, get off my fucking boat.
And that game was an M-rated game, right?
Yes, it was.
And not AO.
Not AO.
Interesting.
It's because there's penetration in it or something.
Yeah.
Oh noes.
Anybody that's learned about the birds and the bees knows that when we're talking about sex, penetration's involved.
I mean, come on, there's a freaking dildo weapon in this game.
I mean...
Thank you for watching!
Grand Theft Auto
I realize that there's very mature 14, 15, 16 year olds out there that can probably handle it.
I know 14 year olds that are more mature than some 32 year olds I know.
Contract.
I think a contract.
Because when you're buying this for the fucking people, make them sign a contract.
If it's their parents buying it for them, say, I understand what is in this game and I understand it, blah, blah, blah, blah.
and then that way if their son goes and murders somebody and they blame it on Grand Theft Auto No, no, no, no, no!
Because you understood what you were getting into so that's your own damn fault.
Bad parent.
Bad.
Alright.
I'm sure we'll get some emails on that one.
Let's go to a happy, family-friendly story, shall we?
We'll talk about Worms!
A nice game about Worms.
Oh wait, these Worms have guns and blow each other up.
I guess this isn't so family-friendly.
I like Worms.
But Worms is coming to the PSP and DS.
I liked Worms when it was called Scorched Earth, and it was out on the PC like 10 years, 15 years ago.
By the way, Scorched Earth is actually being ported to the PSP.
It already has.
That's awesome.
THQ today announced that it will publish two new Worms games for the DS and the PSP.
No release date set yet, but is it really any surprise that Worms is coming out on the DS and the PSP?
Probably not.
I don't know, but THQ, I want my $5 back because the cell phone game version of Worms sucked ass.
I thought this was interesting.
Sega, it is rumored that their new arcade board is actually based on the Xbox 360.
Yeah, I heard that.
The distributors in Japan are saying that the Lindbergh system, which is Sega's new system, their new arcade board, it does use the 360 architecture.
Very interesting.
And this, by the way, would be the second time that a Microsoft console has been the inspiration for a Sega arcade cabinet.
The Chihiro board was based on the current Xbox.
You mean it's not the third time that that's happened since there's only even, I don't know, two systems?
So this logically can only be the second time?
Just reporting what's on the internet out there.
DarkSakura, you're a Sega fangirl.
What do you think of this one?
Sega teaming up with, well, not necessarily teaming up with Microsoft, but certainly using a lot of their stuff.
As long as they're using them and not climbing into bed with them, I'm happy.
You know,
It makes sense, though, because look at, like, for instance, I saw an article on Project Gotham Racing 3, near photorealistic imagery that's in that game.
I mean, it's just amazing just the quality graphics that can be pushed out by this board.
More power to them if they want to make an arcade game like that.
Wait a minute, did I just hear you say something nice about the Xbox?
Yes, about the Xbox 360.
Can somebody please note the date and time?
This is a miracle.
About the 360.
I still dislike the fact that one of the selling points is custom faceplates because that's retarded, but whatever.
It's aimed at that same market that watches Pimp My Ride.
What can I say?
Speaking of the Xbox 360, I have one more quick story on this.
Marvel said this week, and this is of course at the Comic Con convention, they unveiled this, they have an exclusive agreement with Microsoft to produce MMORPGs that will be on the Xbox 360.
Spider-Man, MMORPGs, Fantastic Four, X-Men, Iron Man, only on Xbox 360 and MMORPG 4.
It's going to be a Marvel Universe MMO.
This is no surprise because they actually filed lawsuits against the people that did the Super Heroes City of Heroes because of their character generator people were using to create likenesses of characters that looked
Very similar to this.
And they said that that would cause... That would kind of put a dent in the being able to create an MMO featuring Marvel characters.
So we knew this was coming.
But, yeah.
I mean, DC's doing theirs, so why not?
Sony Online is working with DC.
That was announced earlier, so that's just kind of interesting.
Yeah, you know, that's kind of what I thought when I first heard this.
I was like, don't we already have a game called City of Heroes?
So, you know, there's...
All right.
All right.
By the way, follow up to your lawsuit there, NCSoft had a little bit of a victory there because the judge threw out a lot of Marvel's complaints.
Just so you know.
Alright, moving on.
Loki, why don't you tell us what's going on in the Hack and Crack world?
Lots of stuff.
First off, PSP stuff.
They have released the brand new loader for the PSP
UMD RIPs, it's 2.5E or something like that.
It allows the new RIPs to play, or most of the games to play with Wi-Fi and sound, because I guess the PRX files, they're like these library files, kind of like on Windows, where you have to get a lot of files.
Anyway, library files are being loaded now, so you can do Wi-Fi in a lot of games, and you can also overclock the games as well, which was kind of neat.
So that was one of the things.
The other thing that came out, which was really cool, was the SCUMM VM PSP Beta.
and for those who don't know SCUM stands for um what was it it was uh oh man
I can't remember.
Anyways, it's the programming language that they use to write games like Maniac Mansion and Monkey Island and those wonderful games, LucasArts games.
Anyways, you can actually play these games now.
You can put this file on there and play all your PC games.
Those LucasArts games were awesome.
Yes, they were awesome.
So you can play those, and that was really cool.
Of course, also, the other thing that came out...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Sounds good.
DarkSakura, what are you going to be giving us advice about tonight?
Some people may not want to escape when tied up.
Hey, we need to stay PG rated tonight.
Sorry.
Well, he already dropped the F-bomb.
Yeah, well, fuck what he did, okay?
Okay, sorry.
Number one, when your captors start binding you, expand your body as much as possible.
Take a deep breath, puff out your chest, and pull your shoulders back.
2.
Flex your arms against the bonds.
Push against the bonds as much as possible.
3.
Once your captors leave, suck in your chest and stomach.
Wriggle free with the extra room you have given yourself.
But my final bit of advice.
Yes.
This bondage party is sick, man.
Sick.
Alright.
And with that, DarkSakura, are you on your way out?
Yes, I must.
The man has the car today.
I see.
All right.
And I'd recommend you also don't try to get out your bondages with a lighter because you might set fire to the whole Nazi castle like in Indiana Jones.
Shut up.
All right.
DarkSakura, your final thought then before you take off.
Fuck your Yankee blue jeans.
I'm sorry.
Reject false icons.
All right.
Bye, DarkSakura.
Bye.
Thanks for playing.
Have fun storming the castle.
We're not done just yet.
We have another couple quick stories for you guys, then we're going to make it a wrap.
PlayStation 3.
You remember how PlayStation 3 was originally supposed to double as a router as well?
It was?
Yeah.
It was originally going to double as a router.
Well, kids, not anymore.
It's no longer going to be a router.
They have quietly dropped over at Sony the PlayStation 3 router functionality.
And that was going to, of course, make your PlayStation 3 able to function as a router.
Well...
I can understand why they had it function as a router, because I was looking at the pictures of it, and there's like three Ethernet ports, and I'm like, what the hell is that for?
There's like 5,000 ports on the back of a PlayStation 3.
But Ethernet ports, I'm like, what the hell do they need three Ethernet ports for?
I just didn't understand that, but whatever.
Well, now you've got to wonder, are they even going to be the Ethernet ports anymore, if they're getting rid of the networks?
That is pretty blank.
So are they going to remove functionality, like will they not be able to play games pretty soon, because they've removed the hard drive, they've removed, you know,
This, they removed, what else, I mean Here's a hint, Sony, remove the boomerang Your old controller was just fine Seriously Don't try to improve on something that's already good Alright You know, but the rumor is that the Revolution is still going to have this router capability with it That would be cool
Yeah.
I mean, I don't, I don't, but, but, oh well, we'll see.
We'll see.
We can speculate all we want.
I thought they were releasing their own, like, router or something.
Nintendo's router.
Who knows?
Who knows?
We don't know until they start showing the goods.
Rumors, rumors until then.
Last story tonight.
Interesting report over on bmjjournals.com.
This is a site that's dedicated to, like, it's like a health care archive.
Kind of has a lot of reports.
It's the General Medical Journal website is what they call it on their main page.
They had an article recently about video games and health.
So if you want to look this up, bmjjournals.com, talking about how video games can be used in the treating of cancer patients, which kind of makes you go, well, that's kind of weird.
You wouldn't think of that, but sure enough, they say in the report here, one innovative application of video games in healthcare is their use in pain management.
The degree of attention needed to play such a game can distract the player from the sensation of pain, a strategy that has been reported and evaluated amongst pediatric patients.
One case study reported the use of a handheld video game to stop an eight-year-old boy from peeking at his face.
because, you know, he had this disease that was causing him to want to, you know, pick at his face and stuff.
So just kind of interesting, video games taking your mind off of other things being used as actual medical treatment.
So what a nice follow-up to have to the, you know, video games are evil story that we had earlier in the show.
It sure beats the, you know, dog cone collar for, like, you know, people are trying to pick their face.
Yes, that's right.
But, yeah, I guess that's good.
I mean, you know.
Laura Croft fights cancer
No, I gotta play some more games.
There's... I'm trying to... I gotta work on some Killer7 and hopefully they're gonna port ZZT over.
Otherwise, you know what the next thing I gotta do is?
I gotta make some hacked ROMs and put them in my Nintendo Emulator.
And my final thought is, I'm gonna go play on my new HDTV.
I'm gonna go play 2DX widescreen.
That's it.
