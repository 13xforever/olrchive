323143	323183	Um...
325154	329037	I don't remember too much, whatever was here, and then that was it.
329598	331440	Alright, we'll get to that a little later.
331620	341608	Also, joining us Elise for a little bit, she's about to go run and get some ice cream, but the official lesbian of Orange Lounge Radio, did we give you a nickname?
341769	343290	Precious Amanda.

346333	348374	But you have a follow-up to this, don't you?
348895	350076	I'm not a lesbian anymore.
352552	356433	as the straight listeners breathe a sigh of disappointment.
357293	357953	What happened?
359854	363694	Um... She wasn't very nice.
365975	367955	We didn't work out.
367975	369236	She ruined it for everyone.
369776	371056	Pretty much.

806588	811909	Orange Lounge Radio, Mamani Music, and more.
812149	815450	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 149.
815490	817650	How you guys doing tonight?
817670	819891	Happy Sunday to you guys out there.
820531	823051	I can't believe it's already like mid-July.
823151	824532	Where did this year go?
824672	830253	It seems like it's just, I feel my age slipping away as the days keep flying by.
830333	832553	Is anyone else feeling incredibly old this evening?
832573	833073	Maybe it was just me.
833513	833653	No.
833673	834954	It was just you.
835134	835554	No.
835914	836194	All right.
837213	837533	Hey, Rob.
837734	837934	What?
838034	838214	Rob.
838234	838455	What?
838595	838775	Rob.
838815	838975	What?
839015	839536	Rob.
839676	839977	What?
840037	840377	Rob.
840457	840738	What?
840938	841198	Rob.
841399	841799	What?
844202	844483	Bitch.
845544	845844	So?
845965	846265	Kisses.
847667	850128	First off, I want to thank Loki.
850288	853789	I want to give hearts to Loki because he got me a late birthday present.
853829	858070	He bought me Kirby Canvas Curse, the DS, and you can paint rainbows in that game.
858110	859870	So I'm very excited to go paint me some rainbows.
860010	860650	So that'll be fun.
860690	861851	Thank you, Loki.
862191	865452	As soon as I get paid, I can get your present, but I've been sort of busy moving.
865532	867372	Well, you did give me the seatbelts.
867392	868772	I gave you last year's present.
869053	874794	Those are pretty nifty, except I've kind of been afraid to actually put them in my car because I'm afraid they'll get stolen.
875535	876456	But I'm going to put them in there.
876496	878418	Now that the glass is replaced, I'm going to put them in there.
878619	880041	Because they just replaced my glass yesterday.
882459	886263	I just hope my freaking car doesn't get broken into again, except I will be getting an alarm this week.
886323	889085	I've gotten some leads on some good deals, and I'm very excited.
889125	893108	For those that are not sure where I'm going with this, my car was broken into.
893188	898333	I've lived in this new place where we're doing this show now about, what, about two and a half months?
898593	901275	My car's been broken into twice in that span of time.
901716	902877	I've had two stereos stolen.
903157	906180	The first time, it was funny, because my stereo was actually broken.
906460	907681	So the thieves stole a broken stereo.
907961	913324	Second time, not so funny, because they stole a perfectly fine working stereo and decided to break some glass.
913985	919668	And they screwed up the lock on my car, so I have to climb my big butt over the passenger seat every time I want to get in the car.
919868	925752	That's payback for having a broken stereo the first time they broke into your car.
925772	926952	That's what everybody's telling me.
927072	927913	You were being watched.
928473	929854	I'm not getting any volume here.
930777	931177	No, you're fine.
931197	932938	You sound great.
933478	935259	Just so you guys know, I have headphones now.
935639	938880	I finally replaced my headphones after like a month, so I turned them in studio.
939000	941401	That's probably fair to the rest of us because now I can't hear myself.
941461	942281	Do you want me to turn this up?
942641	942882	A little.
942942	947883	Okay, I thought you didn't like it when I... Well, because you talk like you're screaming into the microphone.
948004	948724	Oh, sorry.
948744	949824	You big old loud mouth.
956045	959426	DarkSakura, has your car been broken into yet in the new neighborhood?
959766	960706	Well, no.
960726	963187	We can leave the door unlocked for weeks and no one will come in.
963687	966107	I know you had the same luck I was having at your old place.
966167	968048	Because the old place I lived in was a big sack of shit.
970048	970649	That's the truth.
971689	976250	Now that you're not living there anymore, do you want to give them a shout out where not to move?
976815	977875	Never live at St.
977895	982097	Tropez apartments on the corner of Garfield and Marconi in Carmichael.
982477	986658	That place is a festering pile of dog crap with worms in it.
988198	991659	Even worse, it's the waste put off by a tapeworm.
993640	994800	And tapeworms eat waste.
994880	997181	Alright, Stalker fans, she doesn't live there anymore, so...
997665	998725	It's waste squared.
999666	1001166	It's waste times infinity.
1001466	1002606	It's super waste.
1003267	1004287	It's uber poo!
1004407	1005627	It's waste extreme.
1005787	1007348	Uh-uh, no, it's uber poo.
1007608	1009749	And Amiro presents Pump It Up Waste.
1009909	1014530	Hey, I saw Pump It Up, um, the new Pump It Up in, uh, Vegas, in Reno.
1015299	1021002	I ended up winning plushies out of the crane games I have one of the donkey dragons from whatever spawn of donkey and dragon from Shrek 2
1043767	1044768	and one of the donkey dragons.
1044988	1045168	Cute.
1045308	1046088	And a Hello Kitty.
1047809	1047969	Aww.
1048429	1049130	I love Hello Kitty.
1049590	1051731	And I got, what else did I get?
1051751	1052511	I got one more.
1053252	1056233	Oh yeah, I played, you know those games where you play basketball?
1056773	1059615	You know, you pay 50 cents and if you hoop you get some type of plushie?
1059635	1060595	I got a plushie fish.
1060915	1061276	Cool.
1061296	1062456	So I beat Julie in the head with it.
1063397	1068199	Well, just because I felt inspired by our chat room with the slap command.
1069099	1071921	I told Julie that it was my homage to the radio station.
1071961	1072741	Your trout command?
1073508	1078673	Slaps Julie with a large trout Julie's car is the suck going uphill She has to turn off the air conditioner
1097282	1098043	Oh, it's one of those cars.
1098063	1100284	She's like, I love my fuel-efficient car.
1100424	1101804	Fuel-efficient, fuel-efficient.
1102745	1105326	I like my car that accelerates up hills.
1106647	1107627	And doesn't lose speed.
1107807	1109088	And I don't have to turn off the air conditioner.
1109748	1112470	It may eat gas, but goddammit, my car is fast.
1112510	1114011	That drive to Reno's a bitch, too.
1114071	1120314	Alright, anyway, since you're already kind of talking about your weekend, I might as well ask you, how was your week, how was your day, DarkSakura?
1121054	1122055	It was awesome.
1122735	1126817	Well, my week was kind of... But the rest of the week was pretty cute.
1127654	1134458	I saw George Carlin last night, and he was freaking awesome, but all he did was talk about suicide and natural disasters, and how it's cool to watch people die.
1135718	1137459	I was like, okay, but he was really funny.
1138019	1151346	But the thing that kind of got me is that he was learning his new material for the 13th HBO special coming up, and he kept reading off paper the whole time.
1151386	1155969	I was like, that's kind of unprofessional, but hey, he's been doing it for, what, 50 years?
1156618	1157559	He's entitled, I guess.
1162301	1170646	I also, you know, we went to the nice places to eat at the Silver Legacy in Reno.
1171487	1173848	And every freaking thing I ate made me sick.
1174549	1176029	So I've decided I'm never eating again.
1177991	1179451	But you were chomping on nuts earlier.
1180132	1180772	Nuts don't count.
1181413	1182213	I like to eat nuts.
1183414	1183734	I bet.
1184771	1213833	um but no my ways of combating it are basically I'm gonna be fasting for the next three days like eating when I really have to um and uh drinking like this tea that's supposed to every and I think it's just because I think that I've got like a toxic buildup or something and last time I did that I ate a lot of garlic and drank this tea and drank a lot of water and it cleared cleared everything up so hopefully I uh
1214298	1216379	Don't have any nasty blood poisoning or anything.
1218760	1219200	Hope not.
1219460	1221681	I mean, that can be kind of dangerous, but just take care of yourself.
1222742	1224482	As I said earlier, you might want to consult a doctor.
1224943	1226743	Yeah, I'm tired of going to the doctor.
1227184	1228284	My butt's finally healed.
1228864	1229605	I'm sorry, my hip.
1230765	1231145	Mostly.
1232146	1233646	Sounded a little foul there for a minute.
1234447	1235087	You know what?
1235247	1235527	What?
1236007	1237048	I'm going to throw this fair to you.
1237068	1237708	Jamie's butt?
1240609	1241070	Rob?
1241270	1241450	What?
1243837	1244558	I got the finger.
1247500	1248681	Alright, anything else you want to share?
1250122	1250262	No?
1250502	1251463	Loki, how was your week?
1251483	1253705	How was your day?
1253765	1254205	It was good.
1254726	1257768	I've been working, doing the work stuff.
1258929	1261211	And... I don't know.
1261311	1266415	I've just been kind of... We went and met with another rabbi yesterday and found one.
1267216	1267856	And guess what?
1268016	1269538	He's an ex-pro wrestler.
1271499	1272400	What did he wrestle as?
1273505	1300116	I don't know, but it was a long time ago, like, you know, back in the day, you know, back when professional wrestling was just coming about, not like, you know, WWE type stuff, but like, you know, back, you know, where spandex suits, you know, that type of thing, anyways, so, um, yeah, ex-pro wrestler, that was kind of cool, and, um, then what else, oh, just been, um, I don't know, sticking around the house and stuff,
1300695	1309942	Playing with my PSP and doing things with the PSP that... Playing with the PSP and doing things with the PSP?
1310143	1313285	They're borderline illegal, you know, that type of thing.
1315707	1316147	I see.
1316688	1321532	I have, right now, I have games on my PSP and stuff.
1321752	1322953	And a lot of fun stuff like that.
1323313	1325915	And then I've been playing games on my PlayStation 2.
1326316	1327677	Like, I picked up...
1328462	1330583	Killer7, and that's sweet.
1330784	1331264	How is that?
1331304	1334346	Well, I guess you can talk about it later on the podcast, but give me a brief rundown.
1334386	1334766	How is that?
1335067	1335767	It's psychotic.
1336367	1337468	That's the best way to describe it.
1338009	1339149	I'm really curious about that game.
1339650	1340270	I want to pick that one up.
1340290	1340810	It plays well.
1340971	1346915	Everyone's griping about the control scheme on it, but it reminds me of, like, almost like Alone in the Dark, in a sense.
1347615	1353159	But it's very, very psychotic, and I've only been playing it for, like, I'm only in the second level, and...
1354190	1358633	It makes little sense, but you sort of get what the story's going on.
1359113	1372862	Apparently, well, I can't really spoil anything, but based on some of the notes that you get and stuff, it makes you feel like that you yourself are another one of his personalities, the character that you're playing, who has seven different personalities.
1373562	1377885	And it's just psychotic, and there's a bunch of people that you talk to.
1378305	1381547	It reminds me also of kind of like a Japanese anime movie or something, because...
1382108	1384709	There's this severed head that you talk to now and then.
1384749	1388391	Then there's this guy that helps you who's on some string, looks like a corpse.
1388711	1390552	There's some other dead guy that you talk to.
1390572	1391893	A bunch of weird shit like that.
1392193	1394214	And it's just psychotic.
1394254	1395274	Just go play it.
1395294	1395654	It's fun.
1396495	1397755	Alright, I'm curious about this game.
1397775	1399776	There's not a whole lot of games that have come out lately.
1400397	1403438	I found myself very challenged this week trying to find something new.
1403478	1407460	Because I try to play at least one new game every week for the podcast.
1407480	1408861	So I have something new to talk about.
1408981	1409141	But...
1410151	1415673	There really wasn't a whole lot new for me to get this week, so I had to go get something I would never usually play.
1415693	1418394	I'll get to that later, though.
1418895	1422296	Anything else you want to share about your week today?
1422316	1423596	I've been playing a lot of PSP games.
1423756	1425117	I've got follow-up questions for you, though.
1425137	1426618	What happened after last week's show?
1426658	1427218	I've got to know.
1427298	1428678	Your family was listening.
1429319	1430239	How was the next day?
1430299	1431540	How was the 4th of July for you?
1431680	1432520	It was fine.
1433040	1434221	They didn't really bring it up.
1434301	1435641	It was kind of just funny.
1436321	1436922	You know, and...
1438499	1439660	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1468069	1472032	So for example, in the beginning of the show, I'm like, oh yeah, I'm down four shots.
1472132	1473513	I was actually down eight shots.
1473673	1481619	And so by the end of the night, I think I was down 16 shots within about an hour, which is probably why I got sick.
1482359	1485382	Or 16 or more shots, because I was gone.
1485442	1488284	And to the point where actually I don't remember parts of the night, so...
1489761	1490622	I remember most of it.
1490682	1492083	It's just a lot of it's really fuzzy.
1492303	1495606	Do you remember just kind of sitting here chilling and then all of a sudden... Yes!
1496787	1497567	I remember that.
1498188	1499949	We just got the stains cleaned up today.
1500489	1501050	It's exciting.
1501850	1502551	I remember that.
1503578	1504499	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1531946	1535729	When the bottle's halfway gone, that's a good clue to stop drinking.
1536810	1539192	The bottle was pretty much gone by the time I was done.
1541274	1548400	So, yeah, but, you know, you should have stopped about halfway, and then you wouldn't have had the, you know, blech episode.
1548420	1552123	Well, I know from now on, and knowing is half the battle.
1552863	1555565	The more you know, G.I.
1555605	1556026	Joe.
1559589	1559849	All right.
1560858	1562138	So yeah, that's pretty much it.
1562199	1563679	I was surprised I didn't have a hangover.
1564839	1566480	Apparently I drank a lot of water here.
1566880	1567680	I don't remember any of that.
1567700	1568380	You did.
1568400	1569461	You drank a lot of water.
1569761	1570741	I don't remember any of that.
1571141	1572742	We had to buy a new Brita filter because of you.
1573002	1573362	No, I'm kidding.
1574442	1577783	Honestly, I don't remember any of the drinking of water or pictures or whatever.
1578303	1579944	But I guess I did, so yeah.
1581524	1581784	Alrighty.
1583085	1583465	Anything else?
1584895	1590917	The entire podcast, like I stated on the podcast, I did not remember any of the podcast, so I had to listen to it.
1590977	1592257	And what did you think when you were listening to it?
1592757	1597939	I thought it was interesting because I'd say the same thing like three times in a row in all one run-on sentence.
1598119	1602240	Yeah, which made last week's podcast our longest podcast to date, thank you very much.
1604521	1608102	It's like, you know, that game completely sucks.
1608742	1611043	I gotta tell you, that game completely sucks.
1611937	1613859	And that game completely sucked.
1613879	1614299	You know what?
1614359	1616461	That's half the other video game podcasts out there, though.
1616521	1618843	Honestly, if you listen to their reviews.
1619464	1622006	Not to knock on the other podcasts, but... But I am.
1623287	1623647	But I am.
1623807	1624208	I'm sorry.
1627110	1627430	Alright.
1628791	1628912	What?
1630473	1630693	What?
1631093	1632034	You were going to say something?
1632575	1632955	Come on.
1633235	1633556	Out with it.
1633596	1634757	I'm going to be nice today.
1634977	1635497	Please.
1635857	1636778	Please be mean.
1636818	1637199	Be vicious.
1638482	1639983	You are a lame-ass drunk.
1668916	1670417	BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD
1691680	1694823	I haven't cancelled my account for Final Fantasy XI or anything.
1711969	1716292	I can go back to that when I find the disc and install them and stuff.
1716513	1718174	Do you want your World of Warcraft disc back, by the way?
1718274	1718694	No, it's okay.
1719055	1720115	I'll fix that later, too.
1721937	1725860	I'm also going to plan on picking up Guild Wars this week, too, so yay.
1726320	1732585	Guild Wars was fun for me for like a week, and then, I don't know, I just kind of, I didn't get it.
1732685	1733906	I thought it was too much.
1734367	1734627	Like, whoa.
1736670	1738351	That mic is screwy, we're going to have to replace it.
1738791	1743235	I saw Guild Wars in action, and I thought it was okay.
1743395	1746477	I don't care for the animation style in it.
1746797	1753322	There's things I really like about Guild Wars, and that is no monthly fee, it's a very pretty looking game, and I like the...
1755484	1758245	Like, player versus player elements are actually really fun.
1758365	1760245	So, it's not a bad game.
1760305	1765446	I just, for some reason, I could not immerse myself in that the way I could Final Fantasy.
1765806	1766806	I have a PSO.
1767287	1768267	I'm fine with PSO.
1770047	1770487	Alrighty.
1771107	1776108	And I got some DS games this week that I will probably touch on a little bit later.
1776348	1776608	Okay.
1776769	1778249	Assuming we get to play it.
1779449	1780489	But, uh, Meteos.
1781469	1783890	And, uh, I got to watch a bunch of, like,
1785457	1786938	Well, stuff that's been around for a while.
1787078	1793561	We had a trial of EverQuest 2, and so Andrew was trying that out, and I was watching that for a little bit.
1794421	1799704	It's just, you know, I've been in the game scene, but out of the game scene at the same time, if that makes sense.
1799924	1806027	I don't know if I should admit this, but I've actually been really curious about EverQuest 2, and I kind of want to try it out.
1806407	1808808	I think PC Gamer has like a child disc or something anyway.
1810846	1812887	What, do you want to be fat and lazy?
1812947	1814748	I mean, come on.
1814808	1815308	No, no, no.
1815808	1828753	The funny thing about Andrew trying the 30-day trial, or whatever, the little trial disk was, as soon as he logged in, he looks at me with this, you know, Andrew look, and he's like, hmm, slash pizza?
1828773	1829734	I'm like, shut up!
1830154	1830734	It was funny.
1831274	1831915	Oh, God.
1833129	1834510	Is that slash pizza thing for real?
1834690	1835390	I think so.
1835690	1836851	We didn't try it, though.
1837251	1840232	I was kind of hoping it was this big urban legend online or something.
1841173	1841493	No luck.
1842693	1843894	Alright, my week and my day.
1843954	1844774	Oh, I'm sorry, is that it?
1844914	1845855	Yeah, that's it, pretty much.
1846664	1848005	My week and my day, it was okay.
1848065	1859114	You know what, since I didn't really have the car to drive around in me, I had a car, but I couldn't really take it anywhere because it was not safe to leave in a parking lot with no window, besides my work parking lot because they have cameras there.
1859935	1861056	I really didn't do an awful lot.
1861076	1864318	I just kind of sat on my big butt and, you know... Sniff.
1864959	1870203	No, actually, a couple of my friends took me places, so I was able to get out of the house at least like once in a while, which is good.
1870223	1870924	Okay.
1871576	1872116	Google Earth Keyhole
1897136	1898317	And now they're giving it away for free.
1898337	1905764	And basically what it is, it's very similar to Google Maps, how you have the satellite views on Google Maps and it's fun to like try and find your house and stuff.
1905845	1909148	But imagine that, but like the size of the world.
1909488	1915674	Like I was traveling to Tokyo and I was looking at the maps of Tokyo and I was looking at Moscow and like all these crazy places, right?
1916114	1920559	It's a way to like travel the world without leaving your chair.
1921144	1922985	which I'm sure would be a great marketing slogan for them.
1923005	1927607	But I find myself fascinated just looking at different places.
1927647	1930468	I'm like, I wonder what the border to Mexico looks like because I've never been there.
1930788	1933349	And I'll look along the Mexican border and see if I can see any people.
1933369	1934350	No, I'm kidding.
1934550	1935991	The White House is pixeled out.
1936211	1939492	Yeah, the White House is pixelated out which I think is very interesting.
1940372	1943434	But it's also that way if I remember right on Google Satellite Maps too.
1943954	1946236	because they don't want bad people to find it.
1946436	1953202	Actually, to add to that, the second search Andrew did, he was like, hmm, let's see if I can do troop movements.
1953262	1954303	I'm like, shut up.
1956451	1958733	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1978611	1980674	And I looked at it, and I couldn't tell.
1980794	1987921	It's either a business complex or it's duplexes type thing.
1988142	1988502	I don't know.
1989203	1991686	I know that sounds very stalkerish, but I'm very curious.
1991886	1999254	As somebody who is part of a startup business ourselves with Orange Lounge Radio and kind of running it out of our apartments...
2000094	2005438	Our address, though, I can't say the address where we live over the air, but it sounds very corporate.
2005518	2008301	Like the name of the street sounds like a street that would be downtown.
2008721	2009502	We have an apartment number.
2009522	2013385	So I think when people hear it... Well, it's also considering the location of what else is nearby.
2013405	2014286	True, very true.
2014626	2018289	I actually live in a very commercial district part of town, so very interesting.
2018549	2025254	So people might assume, like when they see it on the business card, like, oh, they're in a nice office, not out of some schmo's apartment.
2025274	2029578	So I was just really curious if that thing was being run out of somebody's apartment or duplex or if it was...
2030373	2031374	A legit office.
2032255	2032595	I don't know.
2032635	2033196	Am I crazy?
2034757	2035077	Always.
2035718	2036338	Always crazy.
2037820	2037960	Oh!
2038901	2041463	Our chatroom says it is an actual office building.
2043144	2044145	Sakurina says that.
2044306	2046087	And there's pictures of it on popnco.com.
2046127	2049290	See, I should have just done the research and followed the links the old-fashioned way.
2049310	2050171	That's not fun!
2050291	2053794	I had to Google Earth it because Google Earth is the new orange.
2054134	2054435	I don't know.
2055586	2056466	Google Earth is awesome.
2056726	2057386	Here's the thing, though.
2057406	2062168	You can't get it right now from Google's website because they said too many people have tried to download it.
2062448	2063148	But here's the trick.
2063348	2067509	Go to download.com and do a search for Google Earth and you can get it that way still.
2067909	2068509	Ha ha ha.
2068649	2069769	Fooled you, Google people.
2070149	2070849	It's so much fun.
2071750	2073210	I can't explain why it's so great.
2073290	2078231	It's so fun to just look at different areas and look at places I've traveled to and airports.
2079091	2079411	It's fun.
2079812	2081692	But warning, if you live in a rural area...
2082130	2083931	Your satellite pictures probably aren't very good.
2084271	2088933	If you don't live within like 50 miles of a major city, it probably is just a big blur, what your house looks like.
2092214	2099177	Alright, there was that, and I have to give a shout out to this, because it's kind of DDR related.
2099297	2103219	It's a game that's really, really popular over on the DDR Freak forums.
2103980	2106200	It's this game they play in random chat called The Wolf Game.
2106421	2107161	Have you guys ever seen this?
2107999	2108340	Oh, yes.
2117419	2118480	The Salem Witch Trials.
2118560	2120462	I really don't know how to explain it.
2120522	2131210	It's a forum game, and it's kind of like you're trying to fool people into thinking you're human, but three or four players, depending on the game rules, are assigned to be a wolf, and they're slowly killing off the other players.
2131770	2134092	And then everybody else gets to lynch one person.
2134152	2134833	It's kind of crazy.
2136034	2140837	Go to DDRFreeGranumChat, look for any thread that starts with TWG, and they've got rules posted.
2141158	2143720	I played my first game, and I lost!
2144810	2145450	I lost!
2146231	2147592	I can talk about it now.
2148312	2151774	I did not get lynched, I was a wolf, and I got hit by the Vigilante.
2152455	2154236	There was an auxiliary role in the game.
2154276	2155637	But the Vigilante's a new thing.
2156217	2170426	It's kind of like, I don't think it existed in the first few games, but the Vigilante basically is a human that can take out any player at any time, and I got wasted, and I was so pissed off, because I didn't even remember that the game had one of those, but, you know, hats off to the guy that did it, because basically he won it.
2170686	2173908	See, he single-handedly won the game for the human team, so hats off to that guy.
2174268	2174428	So...
2176722	2177342	It's a fun game.
2177663	2179243	I endorse that forum game.
2179483	2181904	Although it took me like 36 games to finally jump in it.
2181924	2182624	I thought it was fun.
2184624	2184885	I don't know.
2184905	2187985	I just wanted to give a shout out to that because I like cute little forum games like that.
2191506	2194247	Anyway, let's see.
2194407	2195027	What else is there?
2195127	2195547	Oh, I know.
2195607	2197848	Let's have Orange Launch Radio movie time.
2197888	2198388	How's that sound?
2198708	2200069	Yay!
2200909	2204650	I'm bitter about movies right now because nobody will go see Land of the Dead with me.
2205567	2206308	Aw, I'm sorry.
2207830	2208531	I'm sad.
2208771	2211995	Oh, I want to respond to some comments in the chat room there.
2212416	2215119	OrangeLoungeRadio.com, click on chat.
2215419	2222528	And if OrangeLoungeRadio.com is not working for you right now, some people are timing out when they hit it, you can view our chat room the old-fashioned way.
2222568	2224831	You just have to connect to an other side.
2225695	2226635	IRC server.
2227295	2230236	A good one would be what's the one I'm on right now here?
2230316	2236077	It's irc.introversion.net if you have an IRC client and then join channel Orange Lounge.
2236577	2238157	So that's the way to do it.
2239317	2241238	But I did want to respond to some folks in the chat room there.
2242158	2245698	The Wolf game is an adapted version of another game called Mafia.
2247259	2249439	Yeah, I forgot to mention that.
2249459	2252240	So if you've played a game called Mafia, you've played a very similar game.
2253000	2254340	Also, I think
2255427	2258429	This game started in live-action form.
2258469	2260490	Like, it's a popular live-action role-playing game.
2260530	2260970	A LARP.
2261411	2263272	It's a fun one-night LARPer, I think.
2263372	2264953	So, something to think about there.
2265133	2266894	So you might be more familiar with this game than you think.
2267054	2268635	So, fun, fun, fun.
2269095	2269755	Good times.
2269775	2273678	Would that be that stupid game, Poison, where you're, like, shaking hands and stuff?
2274778	2275039	I don't know.
2275059	2275899	I've never played Poison.
2276780	2284144	There's one person that's, like, the thief or whatever, and they're shaking hands, and after you shake hands with someone that's basically...
2284571	2285612	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2313942	2315644	You're on the right track.
2315724	2317166	Only LARP I ever did was Vampire.
2318407	2319388	I never played a LARP.
2319749	2322472	I played D&D in high school, like a couple times.
2322592	2325916	I wasn't like a total dork, but I had... Hey!
2326016	2329680	I'm still doing tabletop gaming.
2329760	2330721	There's not a problem with that.
2330801	2332103	Hey, dork pride, yo.
2332543	2333585	I'm playing Buffy.
2335021	2335561	Buffy TV?
2335581	2337583	Please, please, come on.
2338063	2341226	You have to admit, Buffy roleplay is a little bit dorky.
2341707	2342407	But it's fun.
2342828	2343428	That's fine.
2343508	2345050	It's done like a TV episode, it's great.
2345710	2351295	As somebody who co-hosts an internet radio show dedicated to DDR, that's fine.
2351916	2353177	Don't make me go grudge on you.
2362782	2365445	Now I'm having a problem finding that video I wanted to show you guys.
2365485	2366145	I'm so upset.
2367106	2368207	What else is new, Rob?
2368528	2369809	Speaking of... Oh, I found it.
2370650	2374914	Okay, so we love to do Orange Lounge Radio movie time because it's really funny because we're a radio show.
2374974	2375735	You guys can't see the movie.
2375975	2377817	But the audio on this will say it all.
2378137	2382321	So what we're going to look at is a download that's available on ebombsworld.com.
2382381	2383442	It's a very popular site.
2383722	2386125	It's a corporate training video for sexual harassment.
2387598	2389600	I don't know if you guys have seen this, but it's fucking funny.
2390080	2391001	I think I know who this is.
2392082	2395024	It's probably Dave Chappelle.
2395285	2400309	You hear about sexual harassment on TV, and it makes the headlines in newspapers.
2401009	2403792	As an employee, what do you need to know about it?
2404432	2407735	First, sexual harassment is against the law.
2408936	2410817	And it's against your company's policy.
2411578	2413620	So what is sexual harassment?
2414480	2416302	Linda, you are doing a fine job here.
2416604	2417705	Oh, well, thank you, Steve.
2417945	2420347	But, you know, you might try dressing a little sexier at work.
2421508	2422009	I'm sorry?
2422089	2424210	I mean, we're talking about your job here.
2426572	2428274	Angel, I want you to dress a little more sexier.
2428594	2430115	There may be physical harassment.
2431016	2431336	Wow.
2432657	2433658	You're really tense today, Nancy.
2433939	2434079	Ow!
2434379	2434759	Bill!
2435640	2435960	Sorry.
2436601	2438422	Dude, Bill has no sense of hot.
2438823	2440224	I really don't like it when you do that.
2440284	2441405	Can you please stop?
2442145	2443126	Dude, Bill, that's a dude.
2443366	2443947	I'll never stop you.
2445689	2446610	I'd be decking him.
2446630	2447911	Because she looks like she's going to cry.
2449131	2450492	Bill, that's a dude!
2450692	2452053	Verbal Christmas is great.
2453194	2455055	Word around the offices, you've got a fat cock.
2456116	2457536	Yes, I do.
2458677	2459718	I've got a fat cock, too.
2461219	2463160	Maybe we should rub our fat cocks together sometime.
2464381	2465301	Maybe a little oil.
2466322	2467142	Two fat cocks.
2467863	2468263	Together.
2469504	2469624	Oil.
2472205	2477146	It might be visual harassment, such as derogatory posters, cartoons, or drawings.
2478527	2481447	Sexual harassment is not always about sex.
2482107	2485748	It may be the result of a power struggle between a manager and a subordinate.
2487209	2492310	Man, I could go for a power fuck right now.
2493870	2497071	Change is slow, and what was acceptable in time... Here's the best part.
2497091	2498311	This is the best part of the whole video.
2498512	2500392	...can now be sexual harassment.
2505313	2510216	Are you talking about my vagina?
2511257	2511677	Maybe.
2513098	2516079	Everyone wants to be treated fairly and with respect.
2516140	2517881	Are you talking about my vagina?
2518041	2520722	With the courtesy and respect that you want for yourself.
2521383	2524824	It's your company's policy and it's the law.
2528420	2533925	E-bombsworld.com E-b-a-u-m-s-world.com Funniest damn thing I've seen all week, honestly.
2533945	2534546	That was great.
2535687	2536087	Seriously.
2536127	2537108	It's basically what they did.
2537128	2540692	I think they spliced a real video with those fake clips.
2541052	2541352	Funny.
2541512	2542053	Funny stuff.
2542133	2543634	Love it.
2544195	2545716	We're going to pass it around at work now.
2549700	2551161	Are you talking about my vagina?
2551862	2552262	Maybe.
2554454	2555554	Thank you, Paul, if you're listening.
2555615	2556655	Paul's the one who sent that to me.
2557055	2557715	What a nice guy.
2558116	2558896	I've seen that one.
2559316	2559556	All right.
2559976	2565039	For those of you guys that were good enough to sit through that Orange Lounge Radio movie time, I've got a special treat for you.
2565119	2570481	We have a new song from We Love Katamari, the Japanese version.
2570901	2574322	A buddy of mine picked it up and did a rip of the opening song.
2574342	2575363	So you want to hear what this sounds like?
2575543	2577164	One of the new songs from We Heart Katamari?
2577324	2577564	Please.
2577864	2578264	Here it is.
2578324	2579044	It's only a minute long.
2579064	2579725	It's the introduction.
2579745	2580065	Here it is.
2606884	2628021	Walkin' with the sunshine Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na Katamari on the swing Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na Katamari on the swing Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na Katamari on the swing Iba hajimaru yo Ibi to boku no Itaike
2644138	2646800	All right, that was from We Heart Katamari, the new game.
2647080	2652263	It's good to know that the soundtrack is going to be faithful to the first one.
2652583	2659528	Although it sounds like they're going to kind of recycle that theme over and over, but hopefully it's only... I heard that it wasn't as good as the first one, but that was one person's opinion.
2659768	2660288	You know what, though?
2660328	2661970	But how can you top the first one?
2662190	2662710	Seriously.
2662950	2663390	You can't.
2663651	2664091	You can't.
2665432	2667073	The sequels are never as good as the original.
2667193	2668334	Well, the game might.
2668434	2670195	Games are sometimes the exception to the rule there.
2671227	2672828	Anyway, let me play just a little clip.
2672848	2675689	This song is like six and a half minutes long, so I'm not going to subject you to this whole thing.
2675969	2676830	But you have to hear this.
2676890	2680852	This sounds like a guy that did a bunch of DDR songs.
2680912	2681212	It's not.
2681252	2682012	It's actually a different guy.
2682052	2687355	But this is a Japanese beatboxer guy, and this is the training music in We Heart Katamari.
2687375	2689236	I'm only going to play a little clip of this because it's very long.
2689516	2689976	But here it is.
2691617	2693038	We Heart Katamari
2701274	2702035	Thanks for watching!
2719534	2720074	Thanks for watching!
2737586	2738787	All right, you guys get the idea.
2738807	2739348	I think that's funny.
2739368	2739848	That's so cute.
2739908	2740469	I need that.
2740489	2741249	So that's the training.
2741269	2742170	I'll send it to you later.
2742190	2746874	For those of you guys, we have this poor guy in the chat room that's like, what is Katamari?
2746894	2747875	What the hell is this?
2760876	2766417	Very, um, it was kind of a, I guess you'd call it a sleeper hit on the PlayStation 2, Katamari Damacy.
2766797	2773439	Concept is, you're this little guy, and you have a big ball, and you roll it around, and your ball is sticky, and it just picks everything up.
2773759	2782881	So you start out, and you're rolling over, like, gumdrops and thumbtacks, and then suddenly you're running over small animals, and, like, then you're running over people, and cars, and cities, and rainbows.
2782961	2783521	It's beautiful.
2783821	2784361	Beautiful game.
2784721	2788202	Um, you can't really call it, like, an underground hit now, because I think...
2788522	2790322	Tons of people found out about this game.
2790362	2791443	It's almost mainstream now.
2792283	2794543	I wanted to say, though, about that Japanese beatboxing.
2794623	2798864	It totally reminds me, that song there, of something from Bjork's latest album.
2808926	2810426	This is the whole Bjork album.
2810466	2813006	I don't know, when I heard that, I was like, I don't know.
2814927	2815227	Forget it.
2817010	2819511	Just a word to our listeners.
2819531	2823272	I posted in the chat room the Japanese Katamari Damashii.
2825033	2828234	Mina Garaisuki Katamari Damashii is up.
2829834	2831235	And what does that translate to in English?
2831335	2832755	Everybody loves Katamari.
2834676	2835776	Beautiful game, beautiful game.
2836936	2837237	Alright.
2839099	2840220	So we'll be looking at that.
2840320	2840880	Oh, I love this.
2840940	2843882	Our chat room is going, I have a fat Katamari.
2843922	2846183	We should rub our Katamaris together sometime.
2847323	2849124	It smells like Katamari in here.
2850165	2851806	Is that your Katamari?
2852186	2852806	Maybe.
2854868	2856708	Oh, chat room, you're so funny.
2857409	2858169	You're so funny.
2858409	2859190	Me laugh long time.
2859210	2861211	Oh, I actually like the, it's the flashlight.
2861291	2862051	It's kind of cute.
2864753	2865173	All right.
2865693	2866574	Information.
2866674	2866754	Oh.
2867449	2871293	It's about time we start talking about that four panel dancing game.
2871313	2872374	Alright, you want to get into the news?
2872975	2873856	Fine, we'll get into the news.
2876439	2879362	Alright, so, if you haven't heard yet...
2880854	2884818	You might remember when we were talking about this on the show a few weeks ago, because it was huge news.
2885279	2891725	And that was when Konami first filed the suit against... I keep wanting to say Animero, but that's not true.
2891785	2894808	It's Rocksword Games against Indigroove.
2895389	2903858	And most people were saying that it has to do with the fact that what the Boxsword, the system that runs Indigroove, does is it kind of...
2904446	2906767	Stowe's away in a regular DDR machine.
2906947	2918251	And Konami was saying that this was infringing on their trademarks and their patents because people would apply the In The Groove stickers, but they'd do a sloppy job of it, so you would still see distinctive parts of a DDR machine underneath.
2918771	2924773	And it's ruining DDR because In The Groove, according to the lawsuit, you may feel differently, is a subpar game.
2925533	2927314	And they're saying that, you know, that is...
2928211	2943682	Basically, their lawsuit is that lazy arcade owners could in effectiveness make people think that this in-the-groove game is like DDR, when in fact the games, while similar in concept to those of us hardcore fans, we know the two games definitely have their distinctive differences.
2944682	2949726	And a lot of people said this lawsuit is about the arcade only, it's not going to affect the home version, nothing's going to happen.
2949866	2957411	And I remember sitting here on the show and I said, boys and girls, there is an important part of this lawsuit that addresses something called trade dress issues.
2958271	2967639	and one of the little things that they were suing on was the trade dress, saying that In The Groove not only was stowing away the machines, but the game itself looked like, felt like, DDR.
2968300	2971702	But, I don't know, people just seemed to ignore that and they were saying, Arcane only, Arcane only.
2971742	2972403	Well, sure enough.
2974274	2983561	An amended version of the lawsuit was filed against Roxxor on July 1st, and now they've included Red Octane as part of their lawsuit.
2984502	2986484	And they actually have a press release over on their site.
2986924	2989466	We have it linked from our site over at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
2991147	2995951	Basically what it's saying is that... Where is it?
2995971	2996311	Where is it?
2997092	2998653	Oh, that's the original lawsuit I'm looking at.
2998813	2999714	I want to look at the new one.
3000955	3001375	Let's see.
3002296	3002636	Here we go.
3003571	3016941	It says, in addition to the prior counts of the original complaint in which Konami seeks an injunction and damages against Rock Source in the Groove arcade dance simulation game, the amended complaint encompasses the recently released home version of Rock Source in the Groove game.
3017381	3024246	The amended complaint further includes patent infringement complaints against Red Octane, which is the publisher of the home version of In the Groove.
3024687	3025728	So, very interesting.
3025748	3028810	Before we get to the second part of this, very interesting because...
3029952	3033413	You know, this isn't just about the arcade mixes anymore.
3033493	3036234	This is about, in the group, it's too damn much like DDR.
3036334	3037854	Basically is what this boils down to, in my opinion.
3038275	3038975	No!
3039355	3040615	We haven't seen... Yeah, I know.
3040895	3041396	No shit, huh?
3041796	3045577	We haven't seen the specific court documentations yet.
3046317	3052339	Last time DDR Freak went into the government systems and actually pulled the original files out.
3052579	3054119	They haven't done that yet for this amendment.
3054159	3055200	I don't know if it doesn't exist.
3055220	3055880	You can't find it.
3056300	3058841	I will hunt for it later on because I think I know where to go.
3059701	3066246	See if we can find it, but we don't have the exact document, so we haven't been able to read in too much besides what Konami's press release is saying, which of course is one-sided.
3067507	3072210	But the interesting part about this, they didn't just file against Red Octane.
3072310	3081517	The sentence I was reading goes on to say they have also complained against MadCatz, which is the publisher of the game MC Groove's Dance Craze.
3082398	3088764	All these additional accounts are based upon the accused game's infringement of Konami's patent rights in its Dance Dance Revolution arcade game.
3089025	3103119	Now what's interesting about this, those of you guys that have played the Mad Catz game, or even looked at screenshots and know something about it, know that, yes, it's a dance game, but the differences between the dance craze and DDR...
3103749	3110530	I think are a little more so than the differences between in the groove and DDR because of the fact that MC Groove's dance craze basically sucks my balls.
3110670	3111851	I mean, it's an awful game.
3112711	3118312	Long version songs, steps that don't even go to the beat, they switch the order of the arrows, and they have that gyroscope mode.
3118452	3120132	I don't know what the hell it was, but it was a piece of crap.
3121312	3126253	But they're getting sued now too over this, which is very interesting, needless to say.
3128154	3129234	The crack smoking mode.
3130446	3131387	What do you guys think about this?
3131427	3133608	I know you guys had very strong opinions the first time around.
3133628	3136150	I'm sure this just reinforces those, but I'm curious.
3136310	3137331	I was waiting for it to happen.
3138612	3139672	I was really waiting for it to happen.
3140453	3142874	And I'm pretty much glad it is so far.
3145276	3151640	Honestly, these people think that just because Konami's sitting on their ass not getting our games out means that they can do it for them.
3152240	3157384	But hopefully, I have a vague hope that this lights the fire under Konami to...
3159107	3159327	and so on.
3183482	3194605	said before, and I'll say it again, that I'm convinced that the reason why this whole thing happened in the first place is because In The Groove crossed that line and decided to invade the home market, which is Konami's turf right now.
3194865	3197586	So this whole thing, I think we've been working up to this the whole time.
3198346	3199587	This doesn't surprise me one bit.
3199947	3206809	And I think even the In The Groove hardcore fanbase, the rabid fanbase, even I think, at least from the reaction I'm reading on DDR Freaks forums,
3207660	3211583	Even they're starting to say, you know what, yeah, okay, it's no big surprise.
3211603	3218947	But the big beef that I'm hearing from the In The Groove crowd, and tell me what you guys think about this, is the fact that Konami is not releasing product anymore.
3219288	3222750	Here's Roxxor attempting to improve upon that product.
3223030	3228233	Despite how you feel about In The Groove itself, they are attempting to keep it going in the arcade.
3228674	3230895	They're trying to fill a void and make money at the same time.
3232536	3233537	I mean, I really think that's it.
3235614	3262155	I think though, I'm of the school of thought though that while the rock sore corporate group may be in this for the money I think the people that started this whole thing I mean they were DDR fans when they started it I think they had good intentions at heart I think they wanted to keep the arcade's fan base alive and they really wanted to keep this game going because it didn't seem like Konami gave a crap anymore so I think they had the best intentions at heart I just think it's one of those things where
3263326	3263866	Thank you for watching!
3284415	3286597	They're not going to make any money in Rockstars Gone Under.
3287898	3291881	No, I haven't played this MC Dance crazy thing.
3292582	3296785	But it's like, basically it comes down to this, it boils down to this.
3297326	3302790	It's very similar to DDR, like pretty much, you know, it's reskinned DDR as you want to call it.
3303130	3306073	But then again, you have to also go into like, look at the fighting games out there.
3306233	3309055	I mean, Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat and stuff.
3309394	3310375	They're not that different.
3310395	3311235	They're pretty similar.
3311455	3315358	But I guess they're different enough to where they can't sue each other over that type of stuff.
3316599	3325565	So what people need to do out there now is if you want to make a music game, feel free to do so, but just make it different enough to where people aren't, you know... I mean, come on.
3325605	3339175	They weren't even trying within the groove at all to make it any different from... I mean, they were adding stuff to it, whoop-a-dee-doo, and they made the arrows come not quite straight up, but you can change them so they're that way.
3339588	3341790	And they sort of changed the way the arrows look.
3342410	3343231	That's not enough.
3343271	3358562	That's like, you know, taking a Honda Civic out there, painting it a different color, and adding a spoiler to it, and calling it, you know, a Loki's Fast Car, you know, or something like that.
3358923	3359543	It doesn't work.
3359963	3361064	It's the same damn thing.
3363746	3364607	So that's why I think about that.
3367159	3371983	Angel is someone who I think, I get the impression from you anyway, you respect both games.
3372823	3373684	You're kind of like me.
3375065	3384973	I'm not like whoopity-doo over in the groove, but for me it's filling a void that Konami isn't giving us right now with the arcade mixes, and I'm content with it.
3385413	3385893	It's there.
3386134	3386634	I play it.
3386774	3387255	It's cool.
3387375	3391518	I love the USB support, but I completely understand where Konami's coming from on this.
3391558	3393079	I think they're just protecting their own shit.
3393099	3393940	What do you think about this?
3394020	3394420	No, no, no.
3395060	3396802	You hit the nail on the head there, and I do...
3397526	3401927	You know, I do agree with Jamie as far as, you know, I knew it was going to happen.
3401967	3405188	It was just a matter of when, and it's happened now.
3405308	3408768	So, you know, we just got to wait to see what happens.
3408928	3416930	But I do think that Red Octane is still selling it on their site as far as I know, or as far as I've seen.
3416950	3417370	I don't know.
3417770	3420091	Yeah, you might want to, seriously, you might want to run out and get this game.
3420111	3421471	Might want to run out and get it now.
3421691	3423751	It could be a collector's item or something else, that's for sure.
3424491	3425332	Yeah, so...
3429048	3440040	Yeah, so, you know, Rob's right, just pick it up if you haven't picked it up yet, if you think it's, you know, not going to be sold anymore because of the whole, this whole thing.
3440140	3446426	So, yeah, I mean, I pretty much, I have respect for both games, so I can't really say much, but I knew it was going to happen eventually.
3446727	3450170	Yeah, I think you're kind of the same school of thought that I am.
3450551	3450771	Yeah.
3453530	3454050	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3472350	3479875	Not named in this whole thing, but of course you have to remember, Anamiro and Konami kind of have this history of going back and forth, and they settled, supposedly a long time ago.
3480295	3482496	So, this is why Anamiro's not being touched.
3482777	3485718	Which is interesting, because now people are going, how does this affect In The Groove 2?
3486519	3488680	Honestly, people, I don't know.
3489301	3490721	And I'm not going to speculate anymore.
3490982	3493423	I don't know how this is going to affect In The Groove 2, and you know what?
3493503	3494224	You don't either.
3495384	3496025	Nobody does.
3496465	3497165	We'll find out.
3497506	3499467	A lot of it has to do with how this is going to go.
3500222	3508629	So, I kind of refuse to speculate anymore on what's going to happen with In The Groove 2 because this whole thing has become such a damn mess that it's hard to say what's going to happen.
3509029	3512231	Just play the game while you can and hope it's still there tomorrow.
3512712	3513733	Enjoy it while it lasts.
3513753	3515474	And if it lasts a long time, great.
3516775	3517956	I guess that's all I can say on that.
3519517	3520138	Any other thoughts?
3520618	3525802	Is this going to make you, Loki, finally run out and get a copy of In The Groove so you can have a home mix of it?
3526837	3527537	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3553755	3554796	Okay, if you say so.
3579807	3580568	You guys are awful.
3583651	3585072	It'll be a collector's item.
3585232	3585592	I know.
3585953	3586273	I'll go on eBay.
3586293	3592399	Are you talking about... I'll make even... I'll write comments in the manual too, you know.
3592599	3594921	Saying, this game is that way like DDR.
3595262	3596062	What are you talking about?
3596363	3597704	Anyway, Loki, Loki, Loki.
3598164	3598785	Alright, so...
3599916	3616296	either way, somebody's gonna be pissed off no matter what the result of this thing I mean, even if In The Groove keeps going on the DDR fans will be pissed off and if In The Groove production stops the In The Groove fans will be pissed off do you think, though, that if Konami turns out another arcade mix that it'll appease people?
3617026	3622470	and maybe they'll go, oh, okay, so Konami was working on something this whole time, now this whole lawsuit makes sense.
3622490	3623952	Do you think that's going to appease people?
3624472	3625853	Of course, nothing's going to appease everybody.
3625993	3627735	They're going to have to, honestly.
3629996	3633419	They're going to get a lot of pretty outraged mail over this.
3633519	3635361	They're going to have to do something drastic.
3636942	3638423	Honestly, they want to keep your fan base.
3639364	3639804	You know what?
3640064	3642206	I want to bring up a tip that was brought up
3642998	3643639	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3673402	3674683	You'll at least stay stationary.
3677485	3678625	Alright, so something to think about.
3679326	3684109	Alright kids, I think we'll go to a break, we'll come back, and we'll take your calls on this issue if anybody wants to talk to us about it.
3684169	3685269	Loki, and then some other news.
3686010	3686990	You know what I'm pissed off about?
3687070	3687251	What?
3687291	3687771	The guy game.
3687791	3693595	They pulled it off the market completely, even the PC version, but now there's a DVD out there with all the nude cutscenes in it.
3694315	3695175	That's not a surprise.
3695216	3696556	I thought they pulled this thing months ago.
3696897	3700319	But my copy that... er, my purchase copy...
3701306	3701867	and DarkSakura.
3716081	3721824	In this break, to be fair, we will play some music from In The Groove 2 because we actually haven't played any of the new music from In The Groove 2.
3722164	3725966	So one of our listeners, Misty, was kind enough to hook me up, so to speak.
3725986	3727927	So we're going to play three new tracks from In The Groove 2.
3728067	3733851	We're going to play Energizer, Voresprung, Dirch, Techno, and Summer, the Speedy Mix.
3734011	3735992	So we're going to play these songs and check it out.
3736192	3741775	And then we'll be back with your calls in regards to this recent development in the lawsuit world.
3741815	3742655	We'll be back after this.

4219397	4219817	It's super.
4220606	4222927	We are becoming Apple-ized.
4223507	4226087	Yeah, you know, and I'm thinking about buying an Apple laptop, too.
4226147	4228088	I'm slowly converting to the Mac way.
4228148	4230048	Don't you even open your damn mouth, Loki.
4230068	4231128	That's okay.
4231188	4239810	My next computer, I'm actually going to be building a new PC, but the next one I actually buy pieced is going to be one of the Mac Mini G5s.
4239850	4246752	Don't worry, I'm not knocking your perspective purchase of a Mac product.
4247395	4252940	In fact, I was actually thinking of doing my own infomercial for Macintosh and Apple products.
4253800	4255082	It goes a little something like this.
4255442	4260266	Do you like stuff that's pretty but does absolutely nothing that Apple is for you?
4261727	4265150	Because my computer purchases are based on color and not performance.
4266191	4267632	I like stuff that's smooth and shiny.
4268053	4269874	Okay, and then they could sell Microsoft Windows.
4270154	4271916	Hey kids, do you like spyware?
4273735	4275076	No, I'm sorry, that's Internet Explorer.
4275336	4275816	You know what?
4275896	4277157	Do you want to... Hey!
4277337	4277577	What?
4279678	4285622	If you work in graphics, video editing, anything that has to do with audio-visual, a Mac is for you.
4285862	4287183	That was a long time ago.
4287263	4287883	Not anymore.
4288504	4289224	I beg to differ.
4289344	4290105	I beg to differ as well.
4290185	4299490	After having done my Photoshop homework on a top-line PC and then gone back and doing all my touch-ups on a G5, oh yeah, world of difference.
4300331	4302832	To answer a question in the chat room, 15-inch PowerBook.
4305529	4306671	That's why I nicknamed my penis.
4307633	4308435	I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
4313286	4314288	I didn't hear that.
4314408	4315070	Okay, I did.
4315130	4315571	Never mind.
4318464	4321165	Let's go back to the previous topic we were talking here.
4322005	4325586	We actually had a question from our chat room during the break here about this whole lawsuit issue.
4325626	4327767	Dark Knight wanted to know, hey Sky, just a thought.
4328287	4331248	With this revised lawsuit, what about Guitar Hero?
4331328	4335389	Since Red Octane is publishing that game, do you think Konami will go after that as well?
4335989	4336109	No.
4336510	4336630	No.
4337110	4337970	I think no.
4338070	4342511	If Red Octane is still in business after this, which I think they will be, I don't think this is going to set them back too far.
4344772	4346653	I don't think this is going to affect Guitar Hero at all.
4346713	4347013	And I think...
4348090	4357157	Had Red Octane stayed as a third-party peripheral, I don't think Konami would have had a problem with them at all.
4357598	4360260	But they stepped on the toes.
4360300	4362341	That's another very interesting thing about this whole lawsuit.
4362381	4365384	Konami really hasn't been putting out their own pads.
4365424	4367445	I mean, sure, there's bundle packs, but let's face it.
4367866	4373270	Most of us are getting our pads from either Red Octane, Mad Catz, or one of those other countless DDR pad companies.
4373310	4376132	But Mad Catz and Red Octane admittedly being the two biggest companies.
4376960	4378240	Konami's suing both of them now.
4378940	4382061	Are they going to say, well, F you, Konami, we're not going to make these pads anymore?
4382081	4389702	See, they've gone from being, like, protective footwear to being platform shoes that step on the toes of Konami.
4389782	4391323	Honestly, though, come on now.
4391463	4392243	Red Octane.
4392603	4396464	Oh, I did not know that In The Groove was anything like DDR.
4396984	4397664	No, come on.
4397864	4401605	They knew what they were getting into when they decided to go ahead and publish these games.
4402025	4403805	I mean, it's retarded to say otherwise.
4404392	4411018	And honestly, they're not going to sue them over Guitar Hero because Guitar Hero is different enough from Guitar Freaks to be its own game.
4411178	4412339	It's more like Amplitude.
4412399	4413200	Yeah, exactly.
4413220	4416223	Since Harmonix is developing it, it's all kosher.
4416243	4417064	Yeah, exactly.
4417124	4419846	So I'm all for that because it actually looks good.
4419906	4421347	They're doing stuff to improve the game.
4421588	4423730	It doesn't try to copy something else.
4423950	4426532	And of course, our chat room now.
4427073	4428394	I have a fat lawsuit.
4428634	4430656	Let's rub our lawsuits together sometime.
4432236	4432636	Lawsuit?
4432776	4434517	It sounds like fresh lawsuit in here.
4434917	4435998	Is that your lawsuit?
4439800	4441481	Skype line is open, boys and girls.
4441541	4450285	If you would like to talk to us live, head on over to our chat room, www.orangeloungeradio.com and click on interact with us.
4450345	4452726	And that laughter there means we've already picked up a call.
4452766	4454167	So hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4454247	4454627	Who dis?
4455632	4457194	It's Ron-chan, who you think it is.
4457334	4458014	Hello, Ron-chan.
4458034	4464841	Well, see, I can tell by the icon, but the radio bit that we do is we play stupid so that you introduce yourself to our listeners.
4465301	4467043	That's how it works.
4467083	4467883	Hello.
4467903	4469425	Hey, Ok-chan.
4469625	4470366	Ron-chan.
4472448	4473589	What is up, dude?
4474950	4476231	What is up with Konami?
4476291	4480015	I swear, like they're trying to violate the fan base or something like that.
4480295	4481336	That's how I honestly feel.
4481938	4485399	You're a little bit choppy, but I'm going to interpret for those that might have missed it there.
4485899	4490721	Basically, Ranma's saying that they're violating their fan base with this whole thing.
4491882	4497724	I agree to an extent that they're pissing a lot of people off with this, but at the same time, don't they have a right to protect what's theirs?
4498684	4499504	Yes, they do.
4499724	4503666	It's sort of like they want to be the granddaddy of the dancing games.
4503726	4508987	Now, here comes a bunch of new guys come along with something, and they're like, oh no, you can't have that.
4509007	4510668	You must play our game only, not theirs.
4511064	4519689	Well, but considering they did invent DDR, I mean, you could go back and say, well, there was Dance Aerobics, but BS, DDR is its own thing.
4522510	4527853	I think they're just kind of protecting what's theirs, and I think what kind of ticks people off is that this is where people get pissed off.
4528574	4538519	In the groove, probably, I may get yelled at for saying this, but in the groove, probably wouldn't exist if Konami had continued to put out arcade releases.
4538959	4539420	Agree, disagree?
4539440	4539860	You're correct.
4540464	4541065	I agree with you.
4541785	4548611	So, in a sense, I think where people get pissed off is that they feel like Konami abandoned us.
4549011	4560180	Even though they've been doing home mixes, let's face it, the reason why the fan base is so large is because we had arcade tournaments and arcade freestyle competitions and all these things going on in the arcade.
4560420	4562202	We were not doing this stuff in our houses.
4562462	4567226	We're doing it now because we don't have any other choice, but this whole thing started because of the arcades.
4567666	4571848	And the home versions, as good as they've been, are not the same thing.
4572108	4577890	You don't... Remember when we all used to go to Roseville Golf Land on Wednesday nights, back when Roseville Golf Land was cool?
4578250	4579891	We used to play DDR, we had a good old time.
4580471	4583012	You can't get that same feeling with a home mix.
4583072	4586794	And there's people all across the nation, like we are, that did that.
4586834	4589895	And we're all excited when Max 2 came out, because you had the new songs unlocked.
4590315	4591916	And Konami, in a sense, abandoned us.
4592609	4599113	But, okay, now to even further contradict myself or whatever you want to say, at the same time, we were never supposed to have those games in the first place.
4600194	4601715	Ideally, because they were Japanese mixes.
4601775	4603336	We weren't supposed to have them in the first place.
4603596	4608319	But I think Konami was turning a blind eye to the whole thing because it sold home mixes for them.
4608800	4610321	That's how it all boils down, in my opinion.
4611161	4614303	Yeah, and they were making money off the import games being sold over here, too.
4614443	4615204	That's all it was.
4615924	4616124	Yeah.
4616785	4616925	Yeah.
4618874	4620415	Let's look at the reality of this, though.
4621075	4623216	Let's look at where DDR is at now.
4623576	4625696	Where is DDR making all the money now?
4625816	4628077	DDR is making all its money on the home mixes, right?
4628097	4631838	Konami sends out this press release in January saying, Hey, look how big our dick is.
4631898	4635059	We sold a million copies of the home versions of DDR today.
4635139	4636459	We are so freaking rad.
4637219	4642761	So Konami's bread and butter right now is the home mixes of DDR.
4643527	4649570	So now here comes this game that's infringing on the home mixes, which we'll refer to as, I can't believe it's not butter.
4651131	4652732	And now Konami's ticked off.
4653772	4656494	I think that's just kind of where this all boils down from.
4656774	4667519	But the percentage of people who are arcade, rabid fandomness is actually, even though consider the DDR Freak has 50,000 members, ITG Freak, not as many.
4668620	4669320	Like it or not,
4670566	4674449	I don't know how many members of ITG Freak there are offhand, but let me just say, let's say 10,000.
4674709	4677571	I know I think I might be overdoing it for him a little bit.
4677932	4679613	Let's say ITG Freak has 10,000.
4680754	4682595	10,000 out of a million is still 1%.
4684056	4686678	Konami can piss off 1% of its fanbase and cut their losses.
4687279	4694524	Because Extreme 2 and Ultramix 3 stand to be so big that I think things are only going to get better for them.
4695825	4696105	I don't know.
4696165	4697446	That's just kind of my perspective on it.
4698581	4700362	Yeah, and I completely agree with your perspective.
4700542	4702624	See, personally, I'm not an ITG freak.
4702864	4703645	I'm not a fanboy.
4703845	4704946	I like both games.
4705286	4710229	I have the mixes on both sides, and I enjoy playing them, you know?
4710810	4717835	Overall, if it wasn't for the fact that the fans were screaming for more DDR, and the groove wouldn't even be here right now.
4718422	4722906	I just feel that, you're right, Konami did ignore the fans for a while.
4723386	4725208	Some ass came along to do something.
4725368	4730032	It just gave them a reason to... Basically, they just woke the sleeping bear.
4730453	4732274	By the way, I way overshot it.
4732494	4735817	Just under 2,000 members on ITGFreak.com right now.
4736137	4736498	Hell no.
4736518	4737158	Well, shit.
4737599	4739220	So, I mean, look at that.
4740822	4742363	One-fifth of a percent, you know?
4743004	4749129	So, Konami can cut their losses by pissing off the... Assuming every single one of those people are pissed off, which they're not.
4749270	4750791	I'm a member of ITGFreak.com.
4750871	4751592	I'm not pissed off.
4752353	4754334	But I respect in the groove.
4754455	4756697	I respect what in the groove was built on.
4757057	4761962	It was guys like us who happen to have a little programming knowledge who wanted... I mean, let's face it.
4762222	4763724	We all have... Oh, God.
4763784	4764745	Now I'm, like, going off on this.
4764965	4766006	We've all expressed...
4766775	4767937	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,
4781955	4784156	And that was how they were going to continue on with it.
4784196	4786697	So I respect where In The Groove came from.
4786797	4790019	And they wanted to improve on the things they thought needed improving.
4790499	4794581	And despite the way some of us feel about the game, to these guys, it's an improvement on the game.
4794821	4798122	The problem is, is it just, I think, got carried away.
4798762	4801284	And money will do amazing things to people.
4801344	4809027	And I think there was a little bit... I apologize to anybody on the ITG team that might be offended by this comment, but I think there was a little bit of cockiness there.
4809307	4818575	On their end, that they were going to get away with this for forever because, and I say that because, on the message boards for the longest time, people would say, how is this legal?
4818695	4820757	And the response would be, shut up, it is.
4821938	4823199	And now Konami's calling their bluff.
4824900	4828803	Alright, now here's my next question, something I said, somebody has mentioned in chat room earlier.
4829203	4837050	Now that Konami's going after Red Octane and Mad Catz, do you think they'll also go after the creators of Step Mania, even though it's something free to give away?
4842236	4849002	Technically, they kind of already are if you want to go in the school of thought that In the Groove is based off of Stepmania.
4849382	4853886	But as for the Stepmania PC itself, I don't think they're going to.
4854186	4861232	I think because of the fact that Stepmania is open source and they're not making a dime off it, I think it makes it a little harder to get, if you know what I mean.
4862914	4865736	And I think, again, Stepmania is so underground.
4865756	4867758	They're not putting Stepmania in stores.
4868699	4868919	Mm-mm.
4869426	4891590	so I think for that reason Stepmania has been able to stay under the radar even though most of the rabid fanbase knows about it Stepmania in many senses is still a little bit under the radar when it comes into the whole big corporate scheme of things so I think they've been able to dodge the bullet for a while now and I don't see them suddenly becoming a target but the minute they try to make money off of it I think it will be a target
4893038	4893678	And you're right, Loki.
4893698	4897159	It's probably for the best that your machine never did take off, because you'd be in the same boat right now.
4897259	4899299	Actually, no, it wouldn't matter, because it's one arcade.
4899439	4900119	It'd be their fault.
4900359	4902260	But if it took off, etc.
4903660	4904860	I'm not that dumb.
4906181	4907721	So, any other thoughts for us, Ranma?
4908781	4909601	Well, I'll tell you this.
4909621	4916823	The way this lawsuit's going, if Konami says cease and desist on ITG, those copies are going to be worth a lot of money in the next few weeks.
4917763	4920143	It's going to be the new Tengen Tetris, is what it is.
4920964	4922064	Exactly what I was thinking.
4922624	4922904	All right.
4923629	4924449	Well, have a good one, Ranma.
4924469	4926370	Thanks for giving us a call and giving us your opinion.
4926390	4927150	We appreciate it, okay?
4927170	4927730	Later!
4944113	4946915	That reminds me, I'm actually going to be out there for a DDR tournament.
4947015	4949958	And get this, I haven't been to, it's actually a DDR slash in the group tournament.
4949998	4953200	And get this, I haven't been to like a DDR tournament since March Madness, like last year.
4953260	4954021	So it's been a long time.
4954401	4962768	But I figured since I'm going to be on the East Coast anyway for work-related things, my day job, I might as well go ahead and say hello to the folks at the tournament on the East Coast.
4963168	4968613	So assuming that this tournament actually happens, because there hasn't been a whole lot of activity on the forums, but I'm planning on it.
4969253	4971535	It's taking place over at 8 on the break.
4972048	4983057	and it's happening on August 7th and it's called COTC3 Champions of the Coast is what it's called.
4983077	4984939	That's happening at 8 on the break on August 7th.
4985359	4988162	I will be there signing autographs and taking pictures.
4988222	4988702	No, I'm kidding.
4988742	4989403	You guys don't care.
4989443	4991244	But I do want to meet some of our East Coast listeners.
4991384	4993626	So if you're in the area, stop on by and say hello.
4993646	4995628	I have an idea for a game.
4996248	4996869	It's called Hotline.
4997145	4999190	Hyper Italian Siblings.
4999651	5003800	It's basically going to be a platform game starring two funny
5006718	5014024	and air conditioning repairman and they're going to be saving some chick in the fungus land.
5014444	5017587	Do you think I'm going to get sued by Nintendo for copying Mario Brothers?
5017607	5019529	Because it's a completely original idea.
5019909	5025093	I'm just changing the sprites and everything so it looks nothing like Mario but sort of is Mario.
5025113	5026214	Loki, it's funny you bring that up.
5026254	5029657	Have you ever heard of a game on the Commodore 64 called The Great Gianna Sisters?
5030418	5030678	Yeah.
5031038	5031999	It was basically that.
5034637	5056984	Except they replaced Mario & Luigi with little spiky haired females and Needless to say Nintendo filed against them and when people compare People always are comparing in the groove and DDR saying it's Street Fighter versus Mortal Kombat right there Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter are both fighting games and in the groove and DDR both dancing games and to me I
5058474	5062776	When I look at these games, I go, no, it's a little more like Mario and Great Giana Sisters.
5063437	5065798	You know, Great Giana Sisters had some things that Mario didn't.
5066078	5068459	Great Giana Sisters has better background music than Mario Bros.
5068499	5069560	I would go that far to say that.
5069800	5077344	It may not be as memorable to a lot of people, but Great Giana Sisters has a fantastic background music in it, and just a slightly different gameplay.
5077384	5080285	So the games were slightly different, but not enough.
5080385	5084567	I mean, when you played it, you were still like, wow, this is frickin' Mario Bros.
5084587	5085848	You know what I was watching today?
5085868	5086668	I was watching on...
5088504	5092366	was Nickelodeon Gas, their games in Sports Network or whatever.
5092426	5100331	They had reruns of Finders Keepers, and one of the grand prizes on there was a Nintendo Entertainment System with the Power Pad.
5102011	5102692	That is awesome
5120768	5123049	I was going to say it's time to talk about Paris Hilton.
5123069	5124430	No, no, no.
5124930	5128371	We'll open the Skype line up for any... We need a new celebrity instead of Paris Hilton.
5128391	5129472	Lindsay Lohan.
5130132	5131233	Lindsay Lohan, I agree.
5131773	5132173	No, no.
5132833	5134614	How about... That's the point.
5134954	5136315	We're not going to talk about anybody respectable.
5136395	5138776	How about Ben Affleck and Jennifer whatever.
5139516	5141257	They can still call him... Are they back together?
5141277	5142737	They can still call him Bennifer.
5142838	5144078	Wait, wait, wait.
5144098	5144858	Are they back together?
5145018	5146439	That's the new Jennifer.
5146779	5146899	Oh.
5147720	5148380	Not J-Lo.
5148440	5148560	It's
5149844	5151305	DeepThought42 DeepThought42 I plugged in my headphones
5176988	5178789	Wonderful bit of technology that that is.
5178929	5179289	There you go.
5179309	5180389	That's what I had to do here.
5180589	5181229	What's on your mind?
5182089	5182949	Not much.
5183089	5196972	I sent Jamie an email earlier this week because I was on GameSpot.com and I read an article which is yet another travesty in the world of GTA.
5197032	5203353	The politicians are ranting on about GTA, the sex mod.
5204246	5206230	The hot coffee mod that's going around.
5206390	5207412	Oh, I heard about that.
5207492	5210679	I had the article set aside to actually discuss during the podcast tonight.
5211568	5212188	Oh, okay.
5212208	5213028	We can touch on it.
5213048	5214689	We'll get into it in more detail on the podcast.
5214709	5217869	Does this have to do with, I was reading something about the ESRB.
5218129	5219630	Their panties are a huge bunch of this.
5219670	5222910	They're saying that it's violating the integrity of the ESRB.
5223290	5228852	The thing is, is that the company removed the, you know, it's like when you get a demo out.
5229632	5234473	My demo of Umjarmalami, for example, has every single stage in it.
5234733	5235033	It just...
5235513	5237455	blocks it, reprogram part of the code.
5237895	5241678	And that's exactly what they did with GTA.
5242359	5245722	But there are people out there... They would have had to recode the entire game.
5245762	5247203	It would have pushed it back months.
5249425	5251867	If they had actually removed it from the game.
5251927	5253228	It's in the PS2 version.
5253989	5260935	But instead of pushing it back five months to recode the entire game, they blocked it.
5261075	5263537	It's not their fault that someone found a way around it.
5263792	5265773	I give you another example, Bloody War 3.
5266774	5277319	You remember they had the special photographs hidden in the game, accessible through the debug menu.
5277439	5280941	That was awesome.
5281181	5282041	What about the Sims?
5282121	5284242	I mean, you've got the nude patch for the Sims.
5284302	5285363	I mean, that's the same thing.
5286138	5286658	Exactly.
5287178	5288899	Well, but the new patch was a patch.
5288939	5290459	It didn't unlock something that was already there.
5290479	5291660	Same with the hot coffee mod.
5291700	5292360	It's a patch.
5292960	5293160	I know.
5293500	5293861	You know what?
5294081	5305725	I totally side, and I can't believe I'm siding with Rockstar on something, but I completely side with them on this because if they locked it away and somebody went somewhere they shouldn't have, that's not Rockstar's problem.
5306145	5309906	And I think the ESRB's issue with this is they're going to look and see if
5310410	5311951	Were they hiding this?
5311971	5314694	Were they intentionally hiding this from us when they screwed it?
5314894	5315755	Yeah, that's the issue.
5315875	5316816	And I'm going to say no.
5316836	5318177	That's the issue that they're looking into.
5318197	5319298	No, they're not that stupid.
5319378	5320879	It's only in the PC version.
5320919	5322320	You can't unlock it in the Xbox.
5322361	5324923	No, you can unlock it in the PS2 version.
5324963	5325383	Can you?
5325483	5326644	It's in the PS2 version.
5327005	5327925	Yeah, you can unlock it.
5327945	5329727	It's incredibly difficult to do, but you can do it.
5330872	5332774	Oh, but is it like a button code you put in?
5333035	5333215	No.
5333315	5334035	No, no, no.
5334096	5336458	You have to download something to your memory stick.
5336478	5337078	I haven't done it.
5337359	5339361	I'm not really that interested.
5339941	5340402	Yeah, I know.
5340442	5340942	Exactly.
5340962	5343605	The blanks people will go to see some titties in their games.
5343705	5343965	Please.
5344486	5345747	Go play some Custer's Revenge, people.
5350282	5350662	You know what?
5351943	5353705	Right there you're talking about hacking though.
5353725	5359770	You're going on the internet and you're talking about violating the license agreement when you open the box and buy the game.
5360210	5363413	The part of the license agreement says you will not fuck with the game.
5363934	5365475	And you're violating the license agreement.
5365535	5369098	So I think Rockstar's base is covered and I think through this whole investigation.
5369118	5378646	And Rockstar has gone through so much shit in the past couple years by fucking parents ruining this country that damn parents
5380011	5382597	They're not that stupid.
5382637	5384581	They wouldn't do something like that intentionally.
5384661	5386987	They saw the minigame and they were like, you know what?
5387328	5389513	This is crossing a line that we don't even want to cross.
5390525	5390945	I agree.
5391046	5393007	I have to side with Rockstar on this one.
5393047	5395268	I think after the investigation it will be found out this way.
5395608	5399571	And the angry parents, the parents who are angry over this, lesson learned.
5399891	5404113	Watch what your fucking kids download on the internet because that's where they're getting this whole thing in the first place.
5404394	5408836	I have to say, I told Jamie this, but I do in essence agree.
5408916	5411178	If you read the article, it's all basically this one guy.
5411198	5412078	His name is Leland Lee.
5412118	5414320	He's a California assemblyman.
5414840	5416441	Those California bastards.
5416861	5417842	Yeah, I know.
5418262	5419783	A Democrat from San Francisco.
5419963	5420303	Damn it.
5423044	5428667	He has a law in there saying that they do need to overhaul the ESRB.
5428747	5429748	I do agree with that.
5429868	5432949	I do think there needs to be a PG-13 rating.
5434110	5434930	I agree with that, too.
5436051	5443055	Because you go from Teen, which is like Final Fantasy X, to Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.
5443115	5443575	That's not...
5444450	5452216	There needs to be a PG-13, and there needs to be, if you sell an M-rated game to someone under 16, it should be like selling cigarettes to a minor.
5452236	5453517	It should be the exact same thing.
5454838	5455758	To an extent, I agree with that.
5455819	5460442	I think the rules for games should mirror the rules of movies right on down to the rating system.
5460742	5468968	And as much as an issue as I have with the ratings board sometimes, because they'll give a movie like War of the Worlds, which showed flying bodies.
5469028	5470189	Oh, that movie sucked.
5470209	5471130	Yeah, but like flying...
5471770	5476731	Flying Body Parts and everything, and that movie gets a PG-13, whereas... I like Flying Body Parts.
5476831	5478671	I know, but still, it should be R-rated.
5478811	5481672	But you're an adult, and you can enjoy Flying Body Parts whenever you want.
5482072	5483632	I didn't have a problem with Flying Body Parts.
5483652	5485573	I liked Flying Body Parts when I was in high school.
5486433	5486593	Right.
5487173	5487713	But here's the thing.
5487753	5489893	Then you take a movie like Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion.
5490194	5494494	Because they dropped the F-bomb three times in that movie, it gets an R-rating.
5494874	5496335	There is an inconsistency here.
5497095	5497475	Exactly.
5497515	5497755	But...
5498495	5511544	That problem I have with the MPAA aside, I think the MPAA and the ESRB should work together to be using the same rating system because parents already identify with that PG-13, PGR.
5512185	5514366	It's already emblazed in their brains.
5514807	5516608	And so I think they should be just copying that.
5517468	5520349	It's all going back to singling out video games.
5520509	5527392	Why are they not going to... Why are they not raging against Rob Zombie's new movie?
5527472	5529012	Why is it all about video games?
5529252	5542637	And to me, I think it's... The government is trying to... I mean, not to get all conspiracy theory on you, but I think it's just them trying to say what is art and what is not.
5542837	5545978	And they're trying to say that if it's not art, then they can ban it.
5548158	5551100	Am I totally out of... No, I'm with you.
5551320	5552581	I'm with you to a point here.
5552762	5553282	I'm with you.
5554984	5555184	Yeah.
5555944	5556445	I don't know.
5556525	5572138	I mean, that's just my... I mean, that may be a little too conspiracy theory, but I mean, between that and the flag-burning amendment and the fact that our president is going to be electing... is going to be appointing not only a Supreme Court justice, but a chief justice, all that stuff scares me right now.
5572519	5572539	I...
5573803	5577627	As someone who didn't vote for our president, I can say it kind of scares me too.
5578908	5581050	We need to march on Washington from this shit.
5581090	5585295	We need to go to fucking Lafayette Park with a can of caffeine.
5586346	5588128	A bunch of flags and just be like, fuck you.
5588168	5589729	Someone has to do something.
5607353	5614880	I think parents of the world could stand to be educated on this issue a little bit more, but I think to an extent, I think the games should be mirroring the movies a little bit.
5615140	5621186	Because society, for whatever reason, we have this movie thing emblazoned in our head, but for video games, we treat it differently.
5621486	5623708	And for some parents, video games are the babysitter.
5624889	5625110	Yeah.
5625510	5626231	And it's just different.
5626331	5626611	I don't know.
5626631	5628172	And for some parents, television is a babysitter.
5628212	5629954	Have you ever watched, like, CSI?
5629974	5630855	Have you ever watched, like...
5631559	5634221	I mean, just because they don't swear doesn't mean it's not graphic.
5634281	5635401	I mean, that's disturbing shit.
5635421	5639884	Me personally, no, I haven't watched CSI, but I have watched other shows that are just as bad.
5640264	5644487	In fact, I was watching a show the other day that they said shit on it, and I was like, wow.
5644527	5645247	I mean, I didn't care.
5645287	5645787	I thought it was funny.
5645827	5647088	They said shit on Friends.
5647649	5648129	Did they?
5648149	5650670	Oh, I missed that.
5651631	5654653	Yeah, it was one of... I can't believe I know this.
5654813	5658455	I'm mildly embarrassing myself that I know this, but...
5659083	5659583	I remember it.
5659623	5666687	It was one of the episodes where, you know, Rachel and Ross had a little, you know, confrontation and Rachel says, I'm sick of this shit.
5667667	5669008	Wow, I wonder how that got by censors.
5669228	5676652	Anyway, DarkSakura, I know you've got to have a comment on this because you're usually pretty passionate about these issues, so I'm curious what you think on this.
5676852	5681815	It's more of a case of parents being stupid shits and not doing their goddamn job.
5682555	5682975	Amen.
5683135	5684136	It comes down to that.
5685296	5686617	You know, we...
5687765	5697994	It's very sad that the state that our country has become, where we supposedly have all this freedom, and I actually have to sort of quote George Carlin last night.
5699428	5701610	We used to be the land of the free.
5701710	5703532	We used to have all these rights.
5703892	5705613	Remember when we could do this.
5705753	5707775	I was like, you know, that's pretty true.
5707795	5717162	Because now, you know, it's like you and I were discussing previously with my comment about being arrested at protesting.
5717182	5722025	It doesn't matter if you've got, you know, a license to be there.
5722726	5726649	If it's anything that's against the current administration, your ass will get locked up.
5727950	5729852	You know where else they did that?
5731293	5734095	Good number of countries that were under dictatorship rule, huh?
5734916	5735316	Yeah, I know.
5735656	5737938	No, I totally agree with you.
5737998	5742082	But I keep going back to the South Park movie, Blame Canada.
5743103	5743783	You know that song?
5745244	5746145	That's all this crap.
5746365	5752090	And all the freedoms that we have, all the things are being taken away.
5752390	5754292	This country was perfect before Nintendo came along.
5754975	5760702	We've gone from being ultimate right wing to uber leftist and it's all a bunch of bullshit.
5776327	5778849	I still say we do a Million Gamer March.
5778869	5779789	We started here.
5780169	5781570	I say we form our own planet.
5782551	5785573	I think the Million Gamer March is a freaking brilliant idea.
5785913	5787354	We just need to organize.
5787734	5789395	But they're all too busy playing EverQuest.
5789475	5791797	I'm here, East Coast representation, jersey in the house.
5791937	5794018	I will, you know.
5794138	5800322	But knowing the gamer community, we'll try to organize ourselves and then we'll be all, ooh, new Halo.
5801983	5803163	Too busy, gotta go play games.
5803203	5805485	We'll be marching with our DSs and PSPs.
5806337	5808279	Hooray, I'll finally be able to find a PictoChat room.
5808619	5808899	Ha!
5809500	5811181	I haven't found one since E3.
5811421	5811721	All right.
5812042	5814444	All right, we've got to let you go, but thank you so much for calling in.
5814464	5815304	This was a good topic.
5816005	5816525	All right, dude.
5816745	5816986	All right.
5817266	5817866	Have a good one, buddy.
5817926	5818147	Bye.
5818247	5818467	Bye.
5819828	5820128	All right.
5820588	5821109	That was good.
5821369	5821890	I like that.
5822030	5824892	Even though that was a more general video gaming issue, you know what?
5825112	5829075	I think we can do what we want on this program, and we'll talk about that.
5829115	5830036	That's what we're about.
5830116	5830597	That's right.
5831277	5831577	All right.
5832258	5833038	I need some light in here.
5833058	5833899	It's getting kind of dark.
5834520	5834860	All right.
5835585	5836586	I think we're going to go to a break.
5836626	5837446	I'm kind of angry.
5837526	5839287	So I want to hear some Taku because I'm angry.
5839507	5840768	And when I'm angry, I listen to Taku.
5840808	5841288	Lots of Taku.
5841468	5841748	All right.
5841788	5848412	So we're going to hear some Taku along with some other 2DX songs because after Taku, to offset it, I have a little lovey song.
5848432	5849572	I have a lovey-dovey song.
5849893	5850113	All right.
5850133	5853514	So we'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio and tonight's Cage Match.
5853594	5855095	More news, etc., etc., etc.
5990036	5990498	Thanks for watching!
6080922	6081644	Music Playing...
6213303	6214344	Thanks for watching!
6237664	6238505	Thanks for watching!
6311461	6320809	And now, let's listen in to an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting as they debate some of the new programming coming to Orange Lounge Radio.
6321551	6325655	Jamie, I have a suggestion about some of the music in our Bomani Music and More program.
6325675	6326636	Can we talk about that?
6326916	6329258	No subject will ever be taboo.
6329559	6333182	Well, I was thinking maybe we should move Pump Up the Volume from Tuesday Nights.
6333722	6336265	Except, of course, a subject that was just under discussion.
6336765	6342110	Okay, well, what would you think if maybe we cut back on some of the tack music we play on the station?
6342671	6343952	I collect your fucking head.
6345894	6347395	Just like this fucker here.
6348496	6352178	Oh my god, why did you do that to Loki?
6352459	6355821	The holic thing on episode 69 was just a joke!
6356782	6363226	Now if any of you sons of bitches got anything else to say, now's the fucking time!
6364447	6368169	Orange Lounge Radio, where everybody has a say.
6372365	6373086	You know what?
6373566	6375087	I really sound a lot like Lucy Liu there.
6376108	6377429	I'm a really good voice actor.
6377469	6378750	You're brilliant voice actors.
6380671	6385355	Chat room is yelling about the speaking of new programming.
6386935	6391057	There was a post on our community earlier this week that said there was going to be a new show on Friday night.
6392078	6393919	That was what we call a miscommunication.
6394239	6396521	A little miscommunication between two parties.
6397401	6399863	But at least you know that we're working on something.
6399963	6401784	So we're not just resting on our laurels.
6402124	6406346	There is new programming being under discussion for Orange Lounge Radio as we speak.
6407307	6408528	So we will see what occurs.
6408588	6409448	And there's not just that.
6409488	6412810	I know of at least three projects being worked on right now.
6413031	6414952	Just in short, chat room.
6415172	6415372	Mm-hmm.
6416292	6419494	Unless it's me or Rob or Loki that posts it.
6420434	6420814	Question.
6422275	6424276	Unfortunately, yeah, you've got to kind of go with that rule.
6424756	6425517	Yeah.
6426457	6429979	Neither of us post it or it's not listed in there.
6429999	6431100	Or the website.
6431440	6431620	Right.
6431720	6432840	Or we don't confirm it.
6433861	6434141	Don't.
6435122	6435302	No.
6435522	6437103	Not until one of us has confirmed it.
6437203	6438283	OrangeLawnTrader.com, too.
6438383	6442225	As much as we love the live journal community, OrangeLawnTrader.com, too, is a great site to get all the latest news.
6442265	6442385	Yeah.
6444622	6445743	Hey, Loki, turn off the damn game.
6445763	6446503	We're doing a show here.
6474540	6476141	It's not the goddamn game, bastard.
6478902	6484826	In the groove, the game we've been talking about earlier today with the whole lawsuit business, they're still trucking along.
6485286	6489668	They have a very interesting thing going on right now, the Worldwide Road Rally 2005.
6490249	6501395	And if you want more information on this Road Rally 2005, you can visit rocksorgames.com slash roadrally slash, well, I'm looking, it's just rocksorgames.com slash roadrally.
6501455	6503716	I'm specifically looking at the events page right now.
6504950	6507953	8 events that they're trying to get people to compete in.
6507973	6510455	And this is like a nationwide tournament.
6510475	6513217	I think this is their attempt at doing some type of nationwide tournament.
6513257	6514638	Listen to the kinds of things they have here.
6515599	6517360	Most locations played.
6517840	6521903	And you have to prove this by copying down ITG serial numbers.
6522984	6527067	Most unique locations, which again I think is serial numbers.
6527568	6529389	Total distance traveled.
6529790	6532111	How far did you go to visit locations?
6532171	6532512	Now see...
6533332	6537913	I might be able to win this because I'm going to be going to the East Coast on a trip and I might play in the group too out there.
6537973	6539413	So maybe I should start looking for a team.
6541054	6544915	Best marathon score, best team photo.
6546235	6548375	You email them a photo and if they like it, you win.
6548955	6556037	Best freestyle, best costume, and best overall most hardcore ITG freak.
6556937	6557957	Is that grammatically correct?
6558057	6560538	Best overall most hardcore ITG freak?
6560638	6560938	I don't know.
6561607	6565350	Regardless, if that interests you, head on over to rockstoregames.com slash roadrally.
6565791	6573418	Kind of interesting, the idea of a national DDR tournament using pictures or video has been something toyed on for quite some time.
6573458	6577802	So it's very interesting, I think anyway, that the company who puts out in the groove is endorsing this.
6578682	6579443	Loki, your thoughts?
6579483	6580284	I'm sure you have some.
6582005	6584027	I guess it's a good idea, whatever.
6584107	6585188	I mean, where are the prizes?
6586830	6587570	Oh, I didn't even look.
6587811	6588151	Let's see.
6590146	6591107	Bad Rob, bad.
6591127	6591627	Sorry.
6592487	6593248	For shame.
6593508	6594328	Trophies.
6595629	6604593	Overall, most hardcore ITG freak gets two round trip tickets to Las Vegas for the North American tournament finals.
6604913	6605574	You get tribbles.
6606834	6610136	Most locations get up to three packages for the winning team.
6610196	6616579	You basically get like a Megamix CD, a red octane ignition pad, a signed copy of In the Groove, and participation in the lawsuit.
6618220	6618680	You're bad.
6619521	6619621	Um...
6620322	6621623	I'm trying to look at what else they have here.
6621643	6625506	I don't see a whole lot of... Basically signed copies of In the Groove seem to be the big prizes.
6625806	6628769	Some other Red Octane goodies thrown in there for good measure as well.
6629789	6631971	They're nothing to laugh at.
6632011	6632672	They're kind of neat.
6632772	6637315	Especially if you're a true ITG freak, then a signed copy of the game should get a rise out of you.
6637756	6639477	Especially that Las Vegas thing.
6639657	6641859	That's a pretty good one there.
6642960	6643640	And trophies!
6643920	6644601	Who loves trophies?
6648595	6652998	I drove to play a shitty game and all I got was this stupid trophy.
6653719	6655520	The trophy has a big dunce cap on it.
6656000	6657602	Posers!
6676468	6678208	By the way, I'm being yelled at in the chat room.
6678248	6681769	This is the worldwide rally, not just the national.
6682089	6682929	I forgot Canada.
6682989	6684990	Sorry, because I know we have Canadian listeners.
6685110	6685630	I forgot.
6687050	6688871	You're all really close to the border anyway, right?
6688911	6689311	No, I'm kidding.
6690411	6691111	It's worldwide.
6691431	6693292	Do they have ITG machines in Australia?
6693472	6696472	I think there's one in Australia, one in Europe, so it's worldwide.
6697472	6704494	If you're in Europe and you're freaking crazy enough to come to the States and play machines so you can win this contest, hey, more power to you.
6705405	6706325	More power to you.
6707766	6708226	Who cares?
6708426	6709166	Honestly, I don't.
6709726	6713287	Well, I think the whole concept is what's neat, despite how you feel about the game.
6713427	6717928	The fact that the company is endorsing it and is going to fly people to Las Vegas, that's kind of neat to me.
6718909	6720909	And they might not be able to when they're broke.
6721369	6721910	Stop.
6722410	6723550	After the lawsuit.
6726051	6726411	Alright.
6726431	6727591	I'm going to laugh if that happens.
6728251	6729552	I'm the most hardcore.
6729712	6731472	I drove all around the country.
6731492	6732192	Yeah, but we went under.
6735492	6737653	Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match Sound good?
6767628	6771994	The way the cage match works, we play three songs for your listening pleasure.
6772355	6774918	One song selected by each host.
6775439	6779425	And the winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's
6779853	6784656	Avani Music and More Program, which plays 24 hours a day, 7 days a week on this station.
6784836	6785977	We are not live.
6786598	6791901	Alright, you only get to hear a clip of last week's winner, though, because it already won last week, so you've already heard it.
6792281	6794683	So last week in the Cage Mash, we had a brand new winner.
6795423	6796144	Thanks for watching!
6844381	6845382	Thank you for watching!
6872119	6873523	Thank you for watching!
6916719	6921721	Alright, that was a clip of song number one, The Azoic, with Let Me Tell You Something.
6922301	6931045	And let me tell you something, that song is going for its second win tonight, so we'll see if that'll win, or if one of these two new songs will dethrone The Azoic.
6931325	6932926	We'll start it off with Loki's pick tonight.
6932966	6934947	Loki, what did you choose for our lucky listeners?
6935587	6939089	I chose a song called Wraith, because it's awesome.
6939929	6943270	And it's also a new MIDI head track, so... Oh, okay.
6943470	6943971	Goody, goody.
6944051	6944431	Here we go.
6945194	6948899	Monolithic with Wraith Monolithic with Wraith
7133297	7133858	Thanks for watching!
7227223	7228683	Thank you for watching!
7270213	7270842	Thanks for watching!
7315740	7316661	Thanks for watching!
7349665	7354107	Okay, that was song number two, Monolithic, with Wraith.
7354487	7359170	Let's go around and see if it was good or bad, according to us.
7359550	7360330	DarkSakura.
7360650	7362851	It sounds like what I'd... I can't hear myself again.
7363792	7367514	It sounds like what I would hear at the goth club I go to.
7367534	7372776	So, in that sense, it's pretty generic, and I still don't really care for his singing.
7373276	7378599	I like the song overall, but it's pretty generic, so I give it about a seven.
7379759	7380120	Loki.
7380721	7389132	It's a 10 because it reminds me a lot of, especially with the end part, a lot of Enigmas type stuff where they have very atmospheric and stuff.
7389753	7393678	And if this is a good reflection of what the album's going to be like, it'll be really good.
7393998	7395300	By the way, new album coming out soon.
7395600	7395801	Bye.
7398510	7399972	And what... Oh, you gave it to him.
7400652	7403855	Atmospheric is a very good word to describe that song.
7403875	7412684	And you know what's interesting is I think that song has me convinced more than anything that Midihead should really try to see if he can't do, like, music scores for video games.
7413205	7418230	Because I think if he coupled up with the right gaming company, they could do a sweet soundtrack for a game.
7418930	7419010	Um...
7419731	7420712	I'd have to second that.
7421672	7422253	I really do.
7422593	7423193	I don't know why.
7423274	7436382	I mean, DDR is one thing, but he really, like, if the rumors are true and he's not into the album making things so much anymore, he really ought to think about doing the video game scoring because I could hear that kind of music in a game like Devil May Cry or something.
7436402	7436702	I don't know.
7436763	7437763	I just think it would kick ass.
7437783	7441165	Or even, like, he does a lot of good instrumental stuff even just for other things.
7441185	7441486	Oh, yeah.
7441506	7442126	Like media stuff.
7442166	7445148	Seriously, gaming companies, look this guy up.
7445188	7445969	Middyhead.com.
7445989	7446969	He should score your game.
7447670	7449231	As for the song itself, Stand Alone...
7451236	7454018	It's kind of a little too atmospheric to be a standalone song for me.
7454058	7456999	I think it's the type of song I'd enjoy more on the scope of an album.
7457420	7460402	So in that sense, if that is the song on the album, I'm looking forward to the album.
7460422	7462483	But the song itself, I'm not so hot on.
7462703	7464524	So I'll stop talking and give it a 7.5.
7465725	7465985	Angel.
7468427	7468807	I liked it.
7468827	7469407	It was pretty good.
7470828	7475451	Midhead's always been a plus in my book as far as music talent and stuff.
7475511	7476712	So I'll give it an 8.
7477705	7479386	I put the wrong song in.
7479486	7484167	I meant to copy what I put in there to a different folder and ended up copying the wrong song.
7484187	7485027	But hey, it's a good song.
7485147	7488048	I like that it makes fun of clubs, yet it's played at clubs everywhere.
7488108	7489208	So it's a blur, girls and boys.
7503004	7503804	No Bit of Blur!
7504065	7504845	Alright, I like Blur.
7504885	7505605	Let's check this out.
7505645	7507226	Blur with Girls and Boys.
7507246	7508007	We'll be back after this.
7538435	7545037	Streets like a jungle, so call the police Following the herd, down to Greece Unharmed at night
7566940	7568681	Thank you for watching!
7596764	7597945	Thank you for watching.
7598005	7599726	See you next time.
7616716	7619461	Thank you for watching
7668477	7680984	Looking for girls who are boys, who like boys To be girls who did boys like they girls Who did girls like they boys Always should be someone you really like
7694432	7696193	Thank you for watching!
7766283	7771707	Song number three in tonight's cage match, Blur with Girls and Boys, DarkSakura.
7771727	7772408	What'd you think of that one?
7772588	7773408	Ten, it's Blur.
7775330	7775950	How did I guess?
7776451	7777031	Uh, Loki.
7778532	7778632	Ah!
7779553	7780093	Little steppy.
7780314	7781434	Okay, anyway.
7782816	7785117	You know, I like the remix of the song a lot.
7785257	7788660	You know, the remix of the song, I give it ten, but that was just, it felt like something was missing.
7789614	7790335	It's like a six to me.
7790355	7791155	That's the original.
7791475	7794518	How can something be missing from the original?
7796739	7797320	The remix!
7797540	7799581	That's what's missing from it, because it sucked.
7799781	7800742	The remix made it better.
7801142	7802263	So, it gets a six.
7802563	7803604	I don't know who you are anymore.
7804945	7806486	I want Song 2 better.
7807367	7807687	Alright.
7807807	7810009	Blur's Song 2 is awesome.
7810149	7816373	I would, you know, I give the song itself a ten, because I love that song, but I don't know, it's a cage match pick.
7816494	7818375	I kind of like it when songs I haven't heard...
7818769	7822754	But I know it was a mistake, so as a song, I give it a 10, but as a cage match pick, I give it an 8.
7822834	7824155	It's alright.
7824255	7824556	Angel.
7826278	7827279	It's blur, it's good, 9.5.
7830563	7833144	Thank God I didn't get done what I wanted to do.
7834345	7841428	I have a remix that I thought about doing, that I'm looking at doing, that you're going to be like, when you hear it, you'll be like, what?
7842088	7845409	Is it, oh, you know what, Jamie's not in the room right now, is it a Gorillaz mix or something?
7845469	7847490	Is that, uh, something?
7847550	7847750	No.
7847770	7848231	Oh, okay.
7848331	7854393	Imagine, um, it's, just, just, it's in a John Travolta movie.
7854713	7856194	Oh boy, alright, alright, we'll see.
7857202	7859484	Is it like the Black Eyed Peas doing Misery Lou or something?
7859865	7860005	No.
7860205	7860565	Okay.
7861226	7863629	Alright, let's recap the three songs you can vote for tonight.
7863689	7866171	Song number one, The Ezoic, Let Me Tell You Something.
7872898	7876061	Song number two you can vote for tonight is Monolithic with Wraith.
7883769	7887412	And song number three you can vote for tonight is Blur with Girls and Boys.
7896558	7897439	All right.
7897619	7899900	There's your three songs you can vote for tonight.
7899980	7902262	Place vote now.
7902362	7906145	Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.
7906245	7907065	Hurry, hurry.
7907105	7909227	And we'll tally them up and let you know who the winner is.
7910047	7910588	Loki.
7910608	7910688	Loki.
7911127	7914748	This is always a part of the show where I ask you, what's going on in the sim scene, if anything?
7917529	7917829	Nothing.
7918169	7919250	Well, there was only one thing.
7919270	7922551	They were doing some new... Well, a couple things, actually, I should mention.
7923211	7925152	But myself was doing another remix contest.
7926852	7930734	And the thing now, it's no mash mixes unless they're very good.
7931454	7934775	And that was their specific instructions there.
7934795	7935055	I see.
7936396	7939877	And then also... Hey, I have a great Max 300 mix I want to submit.
7946154	7948556	Do you think I could win the Balani style contest with this?
7948676	7952299	I don't know, you know, something like that should be in a dancing game, like in the groove.
7955081	7955682	Couldn't resist.
7955742	7957723	That is so awful.
7958384	7962127	It's like, come on, they didn't even try to make it sound different.
7962247	7962547	I mean, it's...
7964634	7968377	And then what the hell was the middle part there that had nothing to do with the whole song?
7968778	7972962	Because, you know, putting piano stuff in a techno song, that's the hip thing to do.
7973002	7975684	Look, look, you bashed on the game enough tonight.
7975704	7976565	You've met your quota.
7976585	7977345	Go back to the sim.
7977426	7979628	Fine, anyways, nothing going on in the sim scene, really.
7981569	7983851	We're still waiting for the Foon Mix 2 stuff to come out.
7983891	7984792	That's what I'm waiting for.
7984952	7987915	Hopefully by the end of the summer, because we need another Foon Mix release.
7988642	7991543	And really, that's all that's kind of going on.
7991863	8001166	A side note that's kind of interesting, MidiHead, who we've just heard a track from, is going to be doing a podcast coming soon.
8001746	8012870	I believe the date is the 27th of July, and it's going to feature all of his remix songs that he's done for Dance Dance Revolution, including the stuff that's going to be in Ultramix 3.
8014151	8015071	So check that out.
8017784	8020086	If you don't check it out there, we will be replaying it on the show.
8021167	8022187	Will we now?
8022267	8024228	I wonder not.
8024409	8026670	The songs, I definitely want to play that.
8027010	8033655	He's hoping that Konami gets behind this and starts promoting his podcast on iTunes and that type of thing.
8034255	8038758	Get the whole company thing going.
8039178	8041179	I'm still looking to remix some more songs.
8041600	8046683	I've thought about a few things and the next one I want to do is really strange and I
8048355	8049956	It's totally different.
8049976	8052338	I don't even know if it's going to get off the ground.
8052398	8054640	It's not a Bomani track at all.
8055781	8057222	And I already told Rob what it was.
8058223	8059204	I only half heard it, though.
8059224	8063848	If it is what I thought you said, then I'm, yeah, very interesting.
8065469	8065850	I don't know.
8065890	8073056	When I heard the song again, when I was sitting in Mel's, it just sounded to me, I was like, this could be a club track.
8073536	8073937	It could be.
8073957	8075458	Someone should have done a remix of this.
8076460	8077942	But it's very strange.
8078663	8082888	And I don't know if I can do it justice or even do a remix of it.
8082949	8086293	So that's why I'm kind of keeping it under wraps for now.
8087635	8087915	Okay.
8088868	8092051	Hey, tell me about this DM Ashura thing you were talking to me about earlier.
8092511	8096033	DM Ashura is doing songs now for O2 Jam.
8096574	8097554	Yeah, they're still around.
8098315	8102337	His new song for O2 Jam is going to be Go, and they have a little preview.
8102738	8107801	There's a thread on their music production forum about it.
8108806	8109427	So go check it out.
8109447	8117153	It sounds sort of like techno with a bit of the Japanese tribal stuff in there.
8117293	8120015	Sort of like Japan or exotic ethnic type stuff.
8120336	8121496	But it's really good.
8122437	8123758	So definitely check it out.
8123798	8132686	The only problem is it's a recording of someone playing it, so it's not completely in sync, but it's good enough.
8133586	8134027	Get an idea.
8135988	8137129	But yeah, so that's kind of cool.
8137670	8137890	Okay.
8138939	8140740	How many Max remixes put out this week?
8141260	8152287	You know, I haven't been downloading remixes on Bomani style, but, you know, since we've got, you know, a second here, let's... Actually, I found this sim file and it had a real sweet Max remix in it.
8152327	8152727	Want to hear it?
8158931	8159772	Couldn't resist, sorry.
8162193	8163854	It's just so wrong.
8164574	8165375	So, so wrong.
8165796	8173441	But anyways, let's see, this week's Max Remix quota here.
8174442	8181467	Alright, and your total is... Oh, it's like a telethon, waiting for the big results.
8182669	8183790	Well, let's see.
8183850	8196094	There wasn't too much this week, starting with we have The Legend of Max, 300 BPM, whatever that is, Paranoia Climax, Japan Mix.
8197203	8201946	The Legend of Max Tribute and Max Attack, all of which are re-released.
8202627	8206489	However, though, in June, there was quite a bit on the week beforehand.
8206529	8218156	We had Maximizer, Max Naruku Jr., Max Beats, The Legend of Max Part 1, Paranoia, Max Dirty Mix, Legend of Max Mega Mix, Max 300 Mutation, and Rave Max.
8219877	8221378	Oh, and Love It First Max.
8223877	8226879	How about my Max brings other boys to the yard?
8228620	8229060	All right.
8229421	8229901	You wait.
8230201	8230701	You wait.
8230882	8231282	I'm done.
8233603	8233923	You know what?
8233943	8236405	Somebody should mix Max 300 and Energizer together.
8236425	8237686	That would be sweet.
8237886	8238406	What do you mean?
8239067	8239847	You wouldn't hear it.
8240307	8240668	All right.
8241308	8244470	Let's hear tonight's cage match winner.
8244490	8245371	Are you kids ready for this?
8246131	8246411	I guess.
8247152	8250714	Tonight's cage match winner is a type.
8251673	8253435	Girls and Boys, People Have Taste, and song number two that is a tie tonight is
8269597	8273140	He is Zoic with Let Me Tell You Something.
8273220	8274581	So let me tell you something.
8275261	8278663	This means Loki's got to break the tie because his song didn't win.
8279084	8280064	So what do you think, Loki?
8280445	8280785	Holic.
8280965	8282346	No.
8284167	8285969	Which song do I dislike the most?
8287670	8288210	I don't know.
8288270	8289251	Zoic is just kind of...
8290579	8292600	No, I'm going to have to give it to Blur.
8292820	8293741	Woohoo!
8294202	8295363	You've redeemed yourself tonight.
8295383	8295583	Thank you.
8295663	8296243	Whatever.
8296604	8298645	You only did that to redeem yourself with Jamie.
8298665	8306732	Do you realize this is technically the fourth song with Damon singing this one?
8310695	8311035	Wow.
8313157	8314038	Alright, there it is.
8315168	8315989	And you know what's sad?
8316449	8318271	I just got another vote.
8318751	8320253	And it would have broken the tie the other way.
8320553	8321614	But, too late.
8321634	8324356	You gotta get your votes in on time.
8324376	8333745	Then we have Max to the Max, Head to Toes 280 Max Survivor, and Max Insanity with Link.
8337042	8338002	I think we're going to go to a break.
8338042	8345864	When we come back from this break, of course, the FUs of the week because we are angsty individuals and we are going to spread that angst throughout the world.
8346405	8348945	And also when we come back, some Ask Orange Lounge if we have a little time.
8348965	8349565	And you know what?
8349926	8354767	While you're waiting for us to come back, you can also download such sim files as Max Tampon.
8356667	8357588	That's lovely.
8357868	8358768	That's very lovely.
8361129	8363389	I think we need some Eurobeat in the house.
8363929	8365850	So we're going to do some Eurobeat.
8367677	8368739	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8424292	8425020	and the rest of us.
8489131	8490592	Thank you for watching!
8547525	8548432	Thanks for watching!
8629987	8631569	Thanks for watching!
8676437	8677577	Thank you for watching!
8809480	8814244	From Step Squad to Orange Lab, this PDR sucks!
8814664	8817126	Holla!
8818787	8819328	P.S.
8820048	8821249	T.T.P.O.
8823831	8825112	Whatever happened to Step Squad?
8825152	8826193	Are they still doing stuff?
8826874	8827174	I don't know.
8827194	8830236	They're supposed to be going to dinner sometime this month.
8830577	8831237	Oh, that's nice.
8831738	8832178	That's nice.
8832838	8834460	Good bunch of kids, that Step Squad.
8834540	8837202	With the exception of this one girl, DarkSakura.
8837262	8837982	Okay, fuck you!
8838022	8838643	I'm just kidding.
8840285	8842008	Velfia2000, Pandora, Natali from 2DX7Style, Initial D
8850526	8851446	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8880222	8881963	I kind of wish Parapara would make a comeback.
8882523	8883043	Like in the U.S.
8883063	8883883	Yeah, I know.
8884744	8886584	They tried to open a Parapara club in L.A.
8887065	8887745	Did they really?
8887805	8888865	I think it flopped.
8889105	8892387	Pioneers releasing the Parapara CDs here.
8893167	8894207	They need to have a Parapara TV.
8894227	8896428	I've been buying the anime Parapara CDs.
8896488	8899349	They should have a Parapara TV show on AZN television.
8899369	8899969	Have you seen this?
8900570	8903010	I get AZN TV now.
8903031	8905271	They rebranded International Channel as AZN.
8905311	8906392	Now you have a reason to watch TV.
8906412	8907352	The AZN Network.
8907392	8907752	You know what?
8907812	8909653	No, because I caught Fushigi Yugi Dubbed.
8910410	8917316	I'm sorry, I wanted to pour bleach into my head, shake it around, pour it back out, and then follow it up with Witch Hazel or something.
8917336	8919537	I saw some pretty funny sitcom on there the other day.
8919557	8921239	It was some Filipino sitcom, I think it was.
8921359	8922300	It was cute.
8922560	8922940	I liked it.
8924842	8925162	Alright.
8925970	8927971	DarkSakura, why is it that we have to do these FUs every single week?
8959062	8961583	Big F you goes to the fucking hurricane.
8962444	8969728	Because, you know, I was all really, really worried about my family.
8970288	8972270	And it was just a bunch of crap.
8972310	8975391	I was getting all sick and, you know.
8976172	8978353	And then the hurricane, like, hit Sarasota.
8979494	8983096	So it was like, where I'm glad it didn't hit Mobile.
8984296	8985597	It's sort of, I feel let down.
8986378	8987938	In a really, you know, messed up way.
8988579	8988759	But...
8989372	8995975	At least, you know, I'm glad my family and all my friends out in the area are doing okay, and I'm sorry for poor, poor Sarasota.
8997335	9005199	Um, another FU goes to, uh, my digestive system for, I guess, not working anymore.
9007300	9015363	Because, um, I've been going through just, digestion hurts worse than being hungry right now.
9016758	9020139	And that's a horrible state for someone to find oneself in.
9021339	9023880	So I don't think I'm going to eat for a week.
9025140	9026320	And see if that helps.
9026340	9030581	Because I was starting to feel better before I came here and actually felt a little hungry.
9030661	9033001	So I ate a handful of Brazil nuts.
9034122	9035502	And then drank a liter of water.
9035522	9037182	And guess what?
9037903	9038403	I feel sick.
9040283	9040743	Fun, huh?
9042944	9044224	And SU goes to...
9046215	9046755	Buses.
9047836	9048416	Not buses.
9049256	9058681	Like 18-wheelers who drive on the left lane on a two-lane street, especially the winding mountain road going to Reno.
9059401	9059661	Yeah.
9060521	9064083	Y'all can, you know, drive off into a ravine or something.
9066404	9070006	Another F you goes to 18-wheelers that try to pass other 18-wheelers.
9070626	9073427	It's just sort of pointless because they can't really go out that fast anyway.
9075088	9075688	And that's
9078454	9079214	All right, Loki.
9081476	9086018	Um, fuck you to my mouse for the left mouse button to stop working.
9086459	9087819	It doesn't want to click no more.
9088740	9092602	I've clicked it way too many times, and now it just, it spryically works.
9092962	9096064	The other mouse buttons work fine, so I had to buy a new mouse yesterday.
9096865	9100787	Which put me at Best Buy, and then I had to get in a stupid person line, and...
9101286	9101807	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9111707	9113548	You know, I had to feed the paper through five times.
9113568	9114389	It's just, like, nuts.
9114969	9117771	Anyways, um... Fuck either of that.
9118151	9120673	And fuck either the fact that there's no food in my house right now.
9120693	9122234	At least nothing that I feel like eating.
9122755	9124316	Because it's all leftovers.
9124416	9125557	And I have, like, this big thing.
9125597	9128679	I combined, uh... Some steak with the minestrone.
9128719	9130460	And so it's this weird minest-steaky.
9131100	9133622	And, um... Yeah, that's not very good.
9134923	9138045	And then... My work, um... It's okay.
9138686	9139086	But, um...
9140168	9142849	I don't know, I've just, like, been kind of feeling drained lately.
9142889	9148451	I've been trying to stay up till, like, really late on the weekends, but I've been unable to do that for some reason.
9149031	9151052	Just feeling really drained, and that sucks.
9151192	9154953	And fuck you, stupid drivers, because they're always in my way.
9157734	9162595	And, um... Uh... And the group sucks!
9164876	9165316	Are you done?
9166356	9168117	Um, and, um, you know those Macs?
9169315	9171316	My toaster has better processing power than them.
9171596	9171936	You're done.
9177978	9186021	Um, I would like to give an FU to the assholes who broke into my car for the second time, and that's another $100 deductible that I won't be seeing anytime soon, so you can fight me.
9186801	9195944	Um, I'd also like to give an FU to stress, because I was so stressed out on Friday, like, I got, I got this work thing, like, dropped on me literally at the last minute, and...
9196630	9202094	On a normal day, that would have been okay, but I was dealing with other stresses that day as well, and I just wanted to die on Friday.
9202355	9207499	Like, seriously, like, I was so stressed, this doesn't happen to me very often, but I was stressed where, like, I could taste vomit.
9207859	9210601	Like, I'm gonna barf, I swear I'm gonna barf, although I didn't barf.
9211302	9214744	But I really wanted to, and that sucks, to go around all day going, I'm gonna barf, no I'm not!
9215305	9216085	That's how I felt Friday.
9216586	9219308	So F you to barfing, because that's no fun, nobody likes that.
9219688	9221229	Except Loki, when he's drunk.
9221530	9221890	What, Loki?
9224437	9225818	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9253897	9256378	Alright, that's it for my FUs, by the way.
9256518	9258679	So let's go on to DDR Angel.
9259639	9265981	Actually, it's more of an honest FU as far as, uh, you know, the shit that happened in London.
9266321	9266961	Fuck that.
9267362	9268662	Don't mess with people's lives.
9268722	9272323	Hey, I doubly, doubly add to that.
9272603	9283267	Okay, because I spent all day, even though, like, their, uh, what, our early morning is their lunchtime or whatever, even though I heard about it
9286725	9297632	and all those people over there and I was just worried about it and I'm glad that he's okay and I'm glad that the rest of my friends in the UK are okay and they're alive.
9297652	9299033	That's all I gotta say.
9299173	9309820	I got a text message from my sister in the morning about it because she visited London an awful lot because her ex-husband was from there and while I personally don't know anybody except for some of our listeners that are over in that area, um,
9313089	9313810	It's just a horrible thing.
9314170	9314690	It's a horrible thing.
9316032	9316892	What else can I say?
9317092	9318153	What else can be said?
9318614	9320595	It's a horrible thing that shouldn't exist in this world.
9320735	9321196	Exactly.
9321536	9328462	You know, some people that I know are saying, like, you know, we should get used to it or whatever because that's what the world's coming to now.
9328542	9329142	And it's just like, no.
9329183	9330444	No, no, no.
9331104	9335268	The whole point is for all of us to stick together and, you know, pretty much war...
9336075	9339198	The mob's saying, hey, no matter how much you hurt us, we're still gonna stick together.
9339438	9343361	Yeah, at the same time, I refuse to be terrorized by terrorists.
9343761	9353409	So I will be continuing to do my function in this world, which is not only my day job, but to spread shit about people I don't like all over the internet.
9355691	9356252	So you know what?
9357252	9360355	Fuck you guys, we're gonna catch you and... That's it.
9360555	9360955	You're done.
9361976	9363858	And we're gonna go on with our lives and...
9364386	9366847	Do what we do on a day-to-day basis.
9368909	9369649	And that's it, I'm done.
9370189	9372070	Alright, let's get to chatroom FUs.
9376873	9389860	Misty would like to give a general FU to the stupid people side of work and one to the schedule maker at work because I wish he'd just give me a somewhat set schedule so I could get a second job easier since I have no life outside of work and the internet right now anyway.
9393257	9403324	DeepThought42 would like to say F you to the fascist douchebags that run our country and the parents who go crying to them every time little Timmy shoots up his physics class because he played Mortal Kombat when he was 12.
9406206	9418934	Socorina says F you to EA for having some bastard registration system on their PS2 online system that has every name chosen except for stupid names like Pandora... Pandora Noria 2DX?
9419234	9420715	Pandora Noia 2DX?
9421836	9423077	Pandora Noia, I get it.
9424056	9426678	I think that was a way to work in a cheap plug.
9426698	9427498	What do you guys think?
9427518	9428479	I think it was.
9443971	9448213	Doob says, F you, a huge F you to 56k and AOL.
9448534	9452156	I couldn't hear the show for about three weeks because of it, and I can barely hear it now.
9452256	9453517	Everything is so slow.
9453877	9455658	Right now I'm still listening to Heartbeat.
9455878	9456398	Sad face.
9456899	9457059	Aw.
9459240	9462382	Dirty Thief says, F you to Taco Bell for making me fat.
9464025	9464445	You know what?
9464765	9465946	You have the choice to either or not.
9468067	9470528	An MPQ says, F you to Las Vegas.
9470889	9475551	Thanks for telling me that if you're not 21 and you can't spend hundreds of dollars an hour, you might as well be 5.
9476431	9477092	Thanks, Vegas.
9477132	9478753	Thanks for being 90 degrees at night.
9478793	9480874	Thanks for making it a chore just to go outside.
9481694	9483035	F you to driving in Oregon.
9483375	9485776	Attention, Oregon, your speed limits are too low.
9486256	9488117	Also, you can't pump your own gas there.
9488438	9488898	I agree.
9489258	9489978	What the fuck?
9490259	9492800	Are people too stupid to put the hose in the tank there or something?
9493420	9495021	F you to driving through the middle of nowhere.
9495121	9499244	I hope I never see another next exit 10 miles or no services sign again.
9500565	9500905	I agree.
9500965	9501585	What's up with that?
9502746	9503847	Learn how to pump your own gas.
9503887	9504387	That's what we do.
9505268	9506328	That was the last F you, anyway.
9507309	9512452	It's the same thing in New Jersey, I think it is, where you can't pump your own gas.
9512852	9514673	And somebody told me it's to create jobs.
9515534	9515654	Okay.
9518396	9518736	Okay.
9521044	9523086	Alright, moving right along.
9525368	9535698	We're going to get into some Ask Orange Lounge in a little while, so please, if you have a question for us, send us a little message over on IRC or our chat room.
9535758	9538421	Send me a private message if you have a question, something you want to ask us.
9539181	9544907	I want to give a reminder to folks out there that right now Red Octane is putting together that game Guitar Hero.
9545227	9546048	Well, they want...
9546832	9556697	Your contributions, if you happen to be in a rock band, you could be alongside songs made famous by David Bowie, Red Hot Chili Peppers, White Zombies, Ramones, Hendrix.
9556738	9557918	Hey, we should form a band.
9558559	9559759	Seriously, we should form a band.
9559779	9560740	And be really awful.
9560780	9561800	Send some music.
9562221	9562701	Send some music.
9562761	9565642	Since I can't play anything but saxophone and clarinet.
9565722	9568504	You know what we could do is we could remix Max 300 and send it in.
9571446	9572206	No.
9572226	9572266	No.
9573167	9573947	No.
9575168	9575388	No.
9576152	9576472	Triangle Player
9603696	9604856	We'll give you some maracas.
9605037	9606037	You can play the gong.
9606117	9607978	There'll be the samba de amigo maracas.
9608098	9615763	We'll just wheel out the giant gong, and then at the end, Loki just... That would be hideous.
9616783	9624808	Yeah, Loki should be... You know what, Loki should... Loki's gonna have to learn how to play drums.
9625248	9625688	That's what it is.
9625709	9626909	Loki, you learn how to play drums.
9627009	9629711	Dude, all the greats have played drums, like Don Henley.
9630231	9631292	We'll bribe, we'll bribe...
9633325	9634966	We'll bribe Iguana Girl to be our singer.
9635326	9637828	Okay.
9641271	9641871	Alright.
9641951	9643312	Our band would be awesome.
9643372	9659544	Even though our band is destined to be in this game, if you want to try and compete against us, you piddly fools, or you have a friend who's in a band who is feeling like competing against us, fools, go to www.beaguitarhero.com and submit your entry.
9660285	9662226	And you, too, can be a guitar hero.
9665618	9665938	Alright.
9667479	9676605	I guess, uh, since there's no questions for Ask Orange Loudhead... Ask us a question, or we will talk about the Lindsay Lohan.
9676845	9678026	No, we'll go to a quick break.
9678046	9679547	We're going to do a quick little two-song break.
9679567	9681728	But I want to talk about Lindsay Lohan.
9681888	9685951	I want to talk about, well, I have Beatmania on my PSP.
9686651	9687732	Tell us about this, then.
9688132	9693516	I have a Game Boy Color emulator called Rin on there, and I found a ROM for Beatmania 2.
9694403	9696664	and so now I have Beatmania on my PSP.
9697324	9699785	As well as DDR, but I took DDR off there because that was annoying.
9700586	9705068	I found that DDR2 for the Game Boy Color had all the solo songs in it, though.
9705788	9708929	In their 8, or whatever, yeah, 8-bit glory.
9709409	9712811	But Hot Limit's in there.
9713051	9714172	I gotta pull up Hot Limit.
9714332	9714852	That'd be funny.
9715052	9715632	We'll play that.
9716272	9716633	Alright.
9718213	9721935	This is probably going to make my heart hurt or something.
9723436	9728159	If I wind up in the hospital because of hearing this song and I die there, I'm going to haunt you.
9729440	9730300	Just thought I'd let you know.
9730361	9733222	Do you think Lindsay Lohan looks better with red hair or her new blonde hair?
9733983	9735204	I think the red hair looks better.
9735224	9736544	I don't care.
9736885	9738326	I think, though, she needs to eat something.
9738726	9740267	Yes, she needs to eat something.
9740287	9743749	Did you hear about that website, EatLindsay, or FreeLindsay or something?
9743769	9743909	What?
9744049	9744710	What is it?
9745250	9750553	EatSomethingLindsayOrSomething.com, or it's a petition going around trying to... It smells like fresh Lindsay in here.
9750573	9750934	Yeah.
9752068	9753229	Is that your Lindsay?
9753589	9753890	Maybe.
9754090	9755811	Are you talking about my Lindsay?
9757292	9757893	Maybe.
9758413	9762276	Alright, we're starting to get some questions for Ask Orange Lounge, so I guess we should go into that segment.
9762296	9762576	Should we?
9764878	9765058	Yes?
9765379	9767000	Do you got that song for us yet, Loki?
9767280	9767781	I'm working on it.
9767821	9768922	Alright, here we go.
9768942	9770223	We'll go into Ask Orange Lounge first.
9778890	9780591	This sounds like a Mega Man game or something.
9792208	9793069	This is not Hot Limit.
9793089	9796192	Oh, here we go.
9796873	9797454	Cheer, cheer.
9824051	9824432	Wow.
9831960	9832560	Interesting.
9835103	9836304	Alright, let's get to the questions.
9836444	9836885	Enough of that.
9841249	9842571	FeedLindsay.com was the site.
9843823	9846745	Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.
9847246	9850508	Well, will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?
9851029	9854331	Is Lindsay better as a redhead, or is she a buxom blonde?
9854932	9855512	I don't know.
9855792	9856433	You tell me.
9856593	9858454	But secretly, I think she's not fat.
9858715	9864759	I have boobies on my PSP.
9864859	9866661	I hate having to improvise that song every week.
9868302	9869623	First question from Socorina.
9869943	9871705	Can you not talk about Lindsay Lohan?
9873061	9875442	Oh my god, did you hear what she did last week?
9876222	9877743	This is so awesome.
9880544	9885026	But come on, I saw Herbie the... No, forget it, I'm not even going to try.
9885906	9889028	MPQ wants to know, why does nobody ask questions?
9889088	9893830	I think the reason nobody asks questions is because we do this almost every other week, and we really need a new bit.
9894350	9896851	But we're just not feeling creative, honestly.
9897239	9900141	Maybe for episode 150, which is next week, by the way.
9900462	9902183	We'll have something new and fresh for you guys.
9902203	9904625	But until then, it's the same old stale shit you know and love.
9904905	9911070	The set fire to ferrets segment kind of got turned down.
9912211	9914953	Yeah, DarkSakura didn't like that idea, and neither did my landlord.
9914993	9915373	What can I say?
9915393	9919877	The ferrets are awesome, and they're full of love and stuffing and beasing.
9921511	9933140	I should point out, though, you should check out the album art on our podcast right now because it's Orange Lounge Radio and then it has little pictures, little little pictures of each of us and then the ferret in the bottom corner because there were four corners.
9933160	9933620	That'd be four pictures.
9933640	9934981	Whoa, there's pictures of us online?
9935261	9936342	They're little little bitty pictures.
9936362	9937023	Hold on, let me show you.
9937483	9938243	I'll show you what it looks like.
9938263	9939064	I have not seen this.
9939104	9939665	Yes, you have.
9939805	9940525	I showed this to you last week.
9940565	9941546	It's on our website, right?
9942066	9943027	I haven't seen this, actually.
9943187	9943908	Hold on, hold on, hold on.
9944308	9944828	Let me bring it up.
9946109	9946890	Now you're making me work.
9948021	9949061	You better work!
9949122	9952363	No, I haven't seen this because I was trying to come up with something and I didn't.
9955764	9956225	Orange Lime.
9956345	9956725	Oh, sorry.
9956805	9957725	I had to bring it in the pocket.
9957745	9958105	There it is.
9958866	9959106	See?
9959686	9960166	I like that.
9960386	9960667	See?
9961287	9964268	Me, DarkSakura, Loki, Ferret.
9964868	9965549	What's that on?
9966249	9968410	That's our album art for our podcast.
9968550	9969050	Oh, really?
9969270	9969570	Yeah.
9969630	9970231	That's great.
9971711	9972872	That's the icon that I made.
9972892	9975613	Yeah, that's the old-ass icon you made and then I did the border around it.
9975633	9976554	So we kind of co-made it.
9976714	9977094	That's fun.
9977114	9977534	That's cool.
9978075	9982018	And the ferret is our official fourth co-host.
9982058	9982358	Yes.
9985000	9986460	She says the same thing every time, though.
9986480	9988662	No, we should totally get a sponsorship from Scoozy.
9989462	9990323	We totally should.
9991844	9993745	We pimp those ferrets like nothing else.
9994165	9995206	God, we really do.
9995967	10000189	Ron Chan wants to know, can I be the band manager and book y'all at the Apollo Theater?
10001170	10002111	Fuck yeah, bring it on.
10002531	10004972	Oh, fuck no, we'd get booed off at the Apollo.
10006874	10007434	You know what?
10008575	10010197	Spelling Bee at the Apollo!
10010217	10012499	Asphyxiation!
10013159	10014901	A-S-F-I-X-O-N!
10016482	10016663	No.
10017323	10020206	Actually, I have heard somebody try to spell asphyxiation that way, but it was just sad.
10022028	10024570	MPQ is making an interesting suggestion.
10024630	10027793	He says, and this is actually live in the chat room at OrangeLunchRadio.com.
10027813	10028274	Click on chat.
10028314	10033739	He didn't send this over private message, but he says, Let's play the wolf game next week in the chat and radioize it.
10034279	10034719	You know what?
10034739	10041183	I'm not against the idea of doing some type of broadcasted The Wolf game, but I don't know how that would work with the chat.
10041203	10042264	We'd have to have live people.
10042704	10043425	Could be interesting, though.
10043445	10044225	Could be very interesting.
10044605	10049208	I'd have to think about the... What do you call that?
10049268	10049808	Schematics?
10049928	10050869	The way it would work.
10051910	10052570	Let me think about it.
10052610	10056692	MPQ, if you have an idea on how we could do that and actually have it be good radio, send me an email.
10056873	10057333	We'll talk.
10058353	10058854	Might be fun.
10059254	10060214	I'm liking this.
10060395	10061015	I'm liking this.
10062456	10062696	All right.
10063953	10065314	We have no more questions, you guys.
10066614	10067294	You know what?
10067434	10067634	What?
10069455	10070936	We need to have questions.
10071256	10072296	No, this is what we do.
10072396	10074737	Usually when we get no questions is that we can ask each other questions.
10075277	10077458	Rob, why are you so fabulous?
10078658	10079979	Because I am a diva.
10081440	10082080	Hey, Rob.
10082380	10082540	What?
10082560	10084061	Why am I so famous?
10085181	10085981	Because you're a diva.
10086001	10087062	Because I'm a diva.
10088362	10090263	Angel, you haven't been here in a month.
10090823	10092144	Where the heck have you been?
10092164	10093144	Where have you been, young lady?
10094935	10097196	Um, I don't know, gone?
10098316	10099596	That doesn't answer the question!
10099676	10101137	Gone is not a location!
10101837	10103217	Gone is a state of being!
10105338	10106838	Just haven't been able to show up, I guess.
10107459	10108059	Uh, yeah, anyway.
10108119	10108819	She's been invisible.
10109899	10110479	Unfortunately.
10111660	10113200	Domo-kun ate her boobs.
10113480	10114360	That's what's going on.
10115041	10115301	Ah!
10116261	10117241	I got wrist slapped for that one.
10118382	10118682	Alright.
10120662	10122223	See, now the chatroom's starting to like that idea.
10122243	10123523	We'll have to figure that one out.
10124358	10130320	Alright, we're going to go to a quickie break here, and then when we come back from this break, we're going to come back and wrap it all up.
10130960	10133521	Tell you guys what you can look forward to next week on episode 150.
10134301	10141783	So we'll be back after this, featuring, since you guys didn't send us questions, and I'm not pleased, you're being subjected to SmileDK this break.
10141883	10142203	Enjoy.
10143084	10144004	We'll be back after this.
10152835	10168821	I thought a little bit of you today Look how I felt without myself for you Look a little bit at me today You know you gotta try a little harder So you can be my mama, my darling Smile, a little smile, let's enjoy the moment
10186294	10195316	Try it, baby, good, just a little bit of lovin' Gonna feel so fine Is it really true that you feel the same way too?

10268864	10269528	DarkSakura
10295896	10296817	Thank you for watching!
10355999	10359100	We're back here on Orange Lounge Radio, coming here to wrap it all up.
10359120	10363441	You know when I get bored, though, is I start looking through popular DDR forums to see what the kids are talking about.
10364657	10375003	Why is it that on DDR forums there is always this kind of topic, at least on DDR Freak and some of the other big ones, there's always this kind of topic within the first three pages of a forum.
10375383	10378264	Have you ever met your boyfriend or girlfriend through DDR?
10381146	10383707	I don't know, how about it guys, have you ever met your boyfriend or girlfriend through DDR?
10383727	10391552	That's such a freaking old topic, it keeps popping up on every incarnation of DDR Freak, and honestly, as a moderator, I'm already seeing it!
10392628	10395671	Fuck you people, stop posting inane crap!
10396652	10399614	Why can't we have intelligent conversation?
10399974	10406080	Like... Well, some people did meet their boyfriend or girlfriend through DDR, which I think is... But this is an old thread.
10406120	10408422	Yeah, I did, but what business of it is yours?
10408622	10413366	Well, that is the first time I've ever heard Angel say something snide.
10413406	10414207	It's great.
10414247	10415067	You're learning!
10415248	10416729	Like I were corrupting you!
10416889	10418030	I'm with Andrew!
10418230	10419211	Oh, did I say that out loud?
10423144	10424104	Oh, that was beautiful.
10425585	10426825	Save that one for the archives.
10426905	10428206	Angel Gets Mean, episode 149.
10428266	10431747	Finally, after how many episodes?
10434567	10436028	Maybe it's sitting next to Loki lately.
10436048	10437788	He's starting to rub off on you or something.
10439649	10445871	Either that or it's, I don't know, all of our randomness rubbing off on me.
10448431	10450372	Maybe people post this topic because they...
10452636	10455478	They're sad because they want to meet a girl through DDR.
10456279	10459441	They're sad and lonely and they want to meet a girl with similar interests as them.
10460541	10461122	Here's the hint.
10461922	10464024	I want to meet a girl with similar interests as you.
10465024	10469887	Go outside and participate in those interests that you have.
10470228	10474991	Because if you want to find a girl that plays DDR, you know where you're likely to find that girl that plays DDR.
10475711	10476111	I don't know.
10476572	10478053	Out playing DDR somewhere.
10479334	10480014	Food for thought.
10480990	10488376	So my advice, if you're lonely and sad and single and you want to meet somebody, and you know what, I'm a lonely, sad, single guy, but I try.
10488836	10494801	I go out and do things I enjoy because that is where I'm likely to meet people who have similar interests that I have.
10495522	10496883	So I suggest you all do the same.
10499865	10502908	Of course, now we've got all these comments here in the chat room there.
10505526	10507808	What are you talking about upskirt cam for, DarkSakura?
10508508	10511650	I was doing that just to make fun of the DDR stuff.
10513492	10515393	Yeah, that's when I got subjected to that in 2003.
10515733	10518875	Okay, I'm not funny.
10518936	10519136	See?
10519576	10520937	What is this?
10521597	10523339	You were in an upskirt cam video?
10524159	10526101	Angel was not in an upskirt cam video!
10526721	10529903	No, I got subjected to the term upskirt cam in 2003.
10532555	10533375	I get it, I get it.
10535036	10535856	Alright, kids.
10536696	10538936	It's time we end this train wreck of a show.
10539977	10541137	Put the nails in the coffin.
10541777	10543317	Go around and get everybody's final thought.
10543397	10545298	Next week, boys and girls, it's episode 150.
10547758	10549259	Holy crap, are we getting old.
10550439	10551139	I still remember 69.
10551259	10555800	I don't remember 69.
10555940	10556960	Wait, your mic's off, I think.
10557000	10557741	No, it's on.
10558861	10558941	No.
10560324	10561284	Oh, it died for me.
10561304	10562565	Yeah, the mic is going out.
10562605	10563165	There you go.
10563225	10567788	I don't remember episode 69 because I was in San Diego living under the stairs in the Harry Potter room.
10568309	10568689	I remember that.
10568829	10569910	And the gay frat.
10569930	10571330	That was great.
10571871	10572171	All right.
10572791	10573212	So I don't know.
10573232	10573812	What are we going to do?
10573832	10576674	I was surrounded by all these cute guys and they were all gay.
10577354	10578655	What are we going to do for episode 150?
10578795	10580456	I mean, that's a pretty big number.
10581437	10582057	I say it's time.
10582097	10582898	Junk show!
10582978	10583158	No.
10584478	10586220	No, no more of those for a long time.
10586300	10586860	No, no, no, no, no.
10586880	10588081	I say we set the ferret on fire.
10588241	10588381	No!
10595073	10598254	We could rent a wood chipper and throw the ferret through a wood chipper.
10602236	10604497	We'll try performing surgery on that a little later.
10605177	10606097	Here, here, let me try something.
10606117	10606838	Here, let's switch for a minute.
10608298	10610979	What the fuck did the ferret ever do to you?
10611459	10611759	Okay?
10613220	10614761	The ferret has been good to you.
10615741	10616941	The ferret has been nice.
10617422	10617862	Check, check.
10617882	10618222	Here we go.
10622153	10626581	The ferret has been very good to you, yet you treat it so horribly.
10628525	10631691	Do you have some sort of deep-rooted fear of ferrets?
10632913	10634115	Ferret bias?
10635676	10638598	We're going to land ourselves an extra special guest for episode 150.
10638638	10639379	We're going to work on that.
10639399	10640399	You know what I would love to get?
10640499	10642440	I should send an email this week, see if I can make it happen.
10642761	10644201	Because I have connections.
10644662	10648464	We should get some of the folks that made in the groove on the show to argue with Loki.
10648484	10649425	I think it would be beautiful.
10649605	10650685	Oh my God, Rob.
10650845	10652927	You just got a song stuck in my head.
10653007	10653307	Do it!
10653727	10654047	Do it!
10654107	10654388	Do it!
10654448	10657129	That connected song that gets yourself connected.
10658590	10660091	Who was it that did that fucking song?
10660131	10662093	This shit is bananas.
10662173	10664474	B-A-N- No, forget it.
10664594	10665135	On the wall.
10665215	10665855	All right, all right.
10666296	10667757	The chat room is suggesting we have an orgy.
10667777	10669098	I think that was fluke.
10669838	10671640	Episode 150 is girls only.
10671680	10672500	Yeah, screw you.
10672820	10673201	Screw you.
10673361	10673661	Thank you.
10674141	10674442	All right.
10675062	10675782	Let's go around again.
10675802	10676383	Yeah, girls only.
10676503	10678825	All breaks will be girls.
10682047	10682527	Girls.
10682627	10683628	It took me a minute to get that joke.
10683848	10684849	All right, Angel, your final thought.
10686604	10688846	Meteos was interesting, but I'm still playing it.
10690047	10690367	Loki.
10690647	10696372	Beatmania is hard to play on a PSP, or a Game Boy Advance for that matter, or a Game Boy Color.
10697693	10700875	My final thought is, word around the office is you got a fat cock.
10701475	10702196	DarkSakura.
10704778	10706579	I don't know how I can top that one.
10706599	10707320	I do.
10712985	10715447	You should have seen how her eyes looked all of a sudden.
10716648	10717949	That was sexual harassment.
10719691	10721572	I'm going to report you to HR.
10721913	10723274	Oh wait, I am HR.
10723314	10724134	Guess what we do?
10724214	10724855	We flog.
10727057	10730219	Nah, we're all up for those medieval forms of... They flog the dolphins.
10732581	10735183	Oh, I was going to go flog the... No, forget it.
10737886	10740448	No, we use whips and chains and...
10741556	10746777	Okay, I was telling somebody about an anime called Star Trap, Offenders of the Universe.
10747458	10749038	So I'm going to go ahead and quote a line from that.
10750318	10751839	Eat me, beat me, make me write bad checks.
10754860	10756280	And the final word of the show.
10756460	10758561	One word to sum the whole damn thing up.
10759081	10760281	I'm going to give it to DDR Angel.
10760361	10761081	Come on, Angel.
10761101	10762122	You haven't been here for a month.
10762582	10763042	One word.
10763142	10763902	Sum it all up.
10766543	10766923	That's it.
10767123	10767363	Bye.
10769224	10774105	That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.
10774926	10779147	Orange Lounge Radio Live is an Orange Lounge Radio production.

10805569	10828653	I had a real bad haircut and nowhere to go, except the Latin castle and Eckerdrum She had sweatpants, she liked to break dance, she wore a pair of shiny parachute pants I was a geek and she was a superstar Was a judge, was a judge, was a judge, yeah, was a judge, was a judge, like a wife While we're in the street for three nights, a judge
10830590	10854764	I tried to meet her set of standards I had a pretty good collection of masters of the universe I had Boba Fett and Greedo when I was close to 17 She had dates of Dr. Connick and E. Logg and she knew how to back the game She had eyes that looked around for the boys who I had lately grown to hate At the time I was working on a novel Just another proof of my distraction I sometimes wondered what she would think of that
10863746	10867828	Overwine and Crackers by a Lakeside, Wachita just moved back up and Moonwalked home.
10867868	10873351	There was a jerk who put you out, while we're in the street between us.
10873391	10877954	I guess I should have made a sacrifice, or tried to meet her down at Sanders.
10877974	10881936	But she didn't have respect for the drink as I didn't have respect for that.
10881976	10885798	Ruben's shoes were not my style and they're still not, I was into D&D.
