Cheerio, loves.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
How you doing, hon?

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Um... recovering.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Yeah, we'll talk about what's been going on here in a little bit.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And in the other corner, the one and only Tech Masa Loki.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Hey.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
How you doing? Holding up okay?

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
As best as I can.

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,280
OK, let me set this up for you guys

18
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,080
out there who are listening.

19
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,900
Right now, we're looking at the three year anniversary

20
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:02,960
of Orange Lounge Radio.

21
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,620
Now granted, we've only been podcasting

22
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:06,520
for about the last four or five months,

23
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,320
oh, since January, however long that's been.

24
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,960
Well, actually, that would be like six or seven

25
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:10,840
months at this point.

26
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,680
So we've been podcasting a little while.

27
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,360
But our station itself, the live station we have,

28
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,720
has been up for three years now.

29
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,520
We're celebrating that this weekend.

30
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,360
And in honor of our three year show,

31
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,860
tonight when we did our live program earlier this evening,

32
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:28,460
We did a little bit of drinking, a little bit.

33
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:30,900
So we're recovering from that right now,

34
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,340
Loki more so than anybody,

35
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,300
because he had a little experience with my toilet,

36
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,260
needless to say.

37
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:38,100
Let's just leave it at that.

38
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,220
He was bowed down before the porcelain goddess.

39
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,340
Exactly.

40
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:44,080
Dark Soccer and I, we're fine.

41
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,860
Remember kids, don't drink and drive.

42
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:47,860
We're doing this because we have designated drivers.

43
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:48,700
Don't drink and date.

44
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,980
It's food rating, yes, don't drink and date.

45
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:51,820
That's the special important thing.

46
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,420
That might get you into a bit more trouble.

47
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:56,180
However, drinking in DDR is okay.

48
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,020
It's actually kinda funny.

49
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:58,320
It's funny as hell.

50
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,480
I've played DDR drunk.

51
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,620
I did too, Vegas once, I remember.

52
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:03,380
Of all places, I was playing DDR drunk.

53
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,620
I just remember feeling very heavy.

54
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,340
My choker's choking me.

55
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:08,220
All right.

56
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:11,420
Anyway, let's talk about our gaming weeks.

57
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,780
Before we get into the gaming news

58
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:13,620
here on Orange Laundry Radio,

59
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,100
we always talk about our gaming weeks,

60
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,220
starting off with the one and only Dark Sakura.

61
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,320
I know you got your move done,

62
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,980
so you got a chance to play any games this week?

63
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,140
We did move.

64
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:24,820
haven't played any games except the potato peeler on gorillas.com and of

65
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:31,780
course widescreen pong so we did however purchase a 50 inch HD widescreen TV I

66
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:35,100
was gonna say you have a sweet new gamer rig if nothing else as soon as we pick

67
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:39,820
up some component cables I'm gonna be freaking trying out 2dx on that is that

68
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:45,500
the first game you're gonna try on there is beat mania 2d yeah all right sounds

69
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:50,340
good to me you got a sweet gaming rig it sounds like you have a better gaming rig

70
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,940
than anybody else I know so we're definitely gonna have to go over there

71
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:57,100
I'll have to do a podcast over there at some point on your sweet new 50-inch TV

72
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:02,860
I actually added the laptop to it oh and we watched we tried to watch Tokyo

73
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:08,320
breakfast and it wouldn't load so we watched the deadly Negro amazing what

74
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:12,060
it what is that I don't even know it it's this guy who basically screams and

75
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:17,660
yells motherfucker a whole lot pleasant a to Afro Nova oh but the second one is

76
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:24,660
funny. Where can you get that from? Um, totallycracked.com. Sounds appropriate. Loki, you look a little

77
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:30,920
dazed and confused right now, but can you tell us about your gaming week? Take it coherent.

78
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:36,460
My gaming week is mainly, um, Destroy All Humans. That's pretty much all I've been playing

79
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:45,460
this week. Um, I actually did finish the game itself. Um, it is pretty simplistic other

80
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:51,820
than you know destroying all humans but um it's a lot of fun they have the voice

81
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:57,100
actor that does invaders in it so you gotta love that and other than that

82
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:02,380
it's a lot of fun so definitely check it out did you say you got to take a sneak

83
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:11,060
peek at some new PSP game yeah I have a PSP I'm borrowing the PSP version of

84
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:19,900
what was it it was um I know you're drunk but think think hard think hard

85
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:29,900
no um honestly it's um doo doo doo doo doo I remember it's basically um it's a

86
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:40,780
lot of fun it's um you remember what the name of the game is no but honestly it's

87
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:49,500
It's, it's um, I don't even, alright forget it, there's some new PSP game that's coming

88
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,500
out.

89
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,500
I can't believe that.

90
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,500
Dead to Rights.

91
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,500
There you go, there you go, Dead to Rights.

92
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:57,300
Dead to Rights, Dead to Rights Reckoning, and I've been playing that.

93
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:01,700
It's basically like Dead to Rights 2, but it's for the PSP, you've got the dog, it's

94
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,260
a lot of fun.

95
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:07,740
Definitely check it out if you've got PSP, cause honestly there's not that much out right

96
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,580
now, it's for the PSP, so.

97
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:13,180
PSP is suffering from what DS was suffering from like four months ago.

98
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,180
Yeah, exactly. PSP syndrome basically.

99
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,380
Same thing as DS syndrome.

100
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:21,080
You've got to pick up many games that are out there for the PSP right now.

101
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:26,280
You've got Midnight Club 3 that just came out, and you know, Death of the Rites, Reckoning.

102
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,880
You've got to check those out.

103
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:33,280
And those are really good. Especially since you've got the bullet time effect and stuff in that.

104
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,980
Isn't the bullet time effect kind of horrid in a lot of games now though? Ever since The Matrix?

105
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:44,700
Yeah, I mean since the matrix is it still cool. That's what I want to know. Oh hell. Yeah, it's so cool

106
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,740
Yeah, just check it out. It's a lot of fun

107
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:54,820
Honestly, um, but if you really want to you know, save some money and stuff just download the Genesis emulators and whatnot and

108
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:59,340
Play those because they don't cost anything. It's a lot of fun and

109
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:06,340
Definitely if you're out there buying PSP games don't do it while you're drunk because

110
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:11,180
obviously you're gonna be spending money on stuff that you shouldn't be spending

111
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:16,260
money on take it from me okay cuz I'm you know is you drinking go shopping all

112
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:20,540
the time I drink and go shopping yeah exactly and then you become summer you're

113
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:26,260
like what the hell why did I buy this so honestly folks if you're drunk just you

114
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:30,380
know seriously and just you know make your peace with the porcelain God and

115
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:35,180
you know take it from there you're being a lethargic drunk tonight I think it's

116
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,380
very interesting

117
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:41,900
well i've already thrown up about four times over the you know the porcelain

118
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,180
god as you would put it

119
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:47,580
and uh... kneel down before the porcelain goddess

120
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:53,940
i've never actually thrown up when i've been drunk so i've hit a whole new level of

121
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:56,180
drunkenness

122
00:06:56,180 --> 00:07:00,780
uh... but take it from me though the the psp game version of um...

123
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:05,420
The other rights is pretty cool, so I definitely recommend checking it out, but

124
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:10,380
you know, honestly, you know, try it before you buy it. You know, don't go out and buy these PSP

125
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,740
games because

126
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:17,680
they're not that great. They're just, you know, ports of the PC, um, or PS2 versions of them.

127
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,700
So just try them before you buy them, and then, um,

128
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,460
go from there. Alright, sounds good.

129
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:26,180
Now, my gaming week, I actually, I have been obsessed with the DS game all week

130
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:32,060
along and it's Meteos I love Meteos I picked that up earlier this week this is

131
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:36,780
what the DS is all about you guys because I the touchscreen adds so much

132
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:40,780
to this game because it allows the game to be fast paced because you move your

133
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:45,220
blocks literally with the stylus you can you can play this game with the

134
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:49,380
controller and the button but it would not work having to swap the bricks one

135
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:52,780
at a time it just would not work the same but having a stylus where you can

136
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:56,060
drag your blocks up and down because the interesting thing about me yes you can't

137
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:59,400
move them left and right. You only move your blocks up and down, which is kind of weird.

138
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:03,040
It adds this whole new dimension to a puzzle game. I can't explain it, but it makes it

139
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:09,320
very fast paced. Meteos is very cool. I love it because being kind of a short attention

140
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:14,080
gamer or a gamer ADD, as I sometimes call it, or sometimes I only want to play a game

141
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:19,040
for 5-10 minutes, Meteos works out really well for me. A lot of people have been comparing

142
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:23,240
this game to Luminous. Well, of course, the same company, same developer. I would say

143
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:27,880
The music and graphics aren't quite what they are in Luminous, but I think that's just a

144
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,160
system holdback.

145
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,920
I mean, obviously on the PSP, which is more CD-based, you're going to get better music

146
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:36,400
and you get stuff like the Mondo Grosso track, Shinin', whatever.

147
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,680
It works out better for that.

148
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:44,120
But that's not to knock Meteos because it's an incredible concept for a game, and the

149
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:48,480
type of game it is you could not do on the PSP because of the touchscreen and everything.

150
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,800
Definitely if you're a DS owner, if you like puzzle games to any extent, if you went out

151
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:56,480
bought puyo puyo fever or you buy any other puzzler pilarium man if you wasted

152
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,200
the money on pilarium trust me you're gonna love medios it redeems DS puzzlers

153
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,440
by quite a bit so I highly recommend it that's been the game I've been playing

154
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,040
I'm still waiting for like your plankton I'm looking forward to electroplank and

155
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:12,080
of course nintendogs so we'll see I got my puppies ordered real are you getting

156
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:17,240
the u.s. or Japanese one the u.s. I know a lot of thinking get it at a 30% off

157
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:21,940
discount all right all right let's get into some gaming news first off though

158

show just remember we're a little we're a little out of it tonight so this this

163
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:51,080
This isn't quite representative of our normal perky cells, but darn it, we are giving you

164
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:55,600
a podcast every week, come hell or high water, and I think this just proves it.

165
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,600
Or lots of booze.

166
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,600
Oh yeah.

167
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,600
Or channel 11 shots.

168
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,400
I still can't believe I out-drunk Loki, and I'm more sober.

169
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:06,600
Alright, I was going to ask Loki, uh, Loki looks passed out now, I think he's actually

170
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,560
fell asleep, I was going to ask you if anything's going on in the hack and crack scene, in a

171
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,720
couple sentences, anything?

172
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:18,960
the 1.5 version PSP stuff but that's when that was released last week then

173
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:26,460
that really only thing to mention is the loader for the luminous is available for

174
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:31,840
the PSP so that means you know there's gonna be more PSP games so they're

175
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:35,520
actually running the ROMs for but that's kind of a gray area because that's

176
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:40,280
piracy flat-out really yeah there's piracy but that's pretty much the big

177
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:44,920
things going on the PSP world but if I'm not mistaken wouldn't these versions of

178
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:48,500
luminous or whatever that you load on your memory car or memory stick when

179
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:53,360
they have stripped graphics typically like a lot of them what was it Dreamcast

180
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,760
when they were trying to put those on CDs they would sometimes have to strip

181
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,120
out some of the audio and luminous if you strip out the audio and some of the

182
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,640
graphics it's not going to be the same game the audience at the audio is

183
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,320
essential to a game like Luma all I don't know if they're doing so far but

184
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,580
But so far, the thing that's been stripped out is all the audio.

185
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:15,180
So all the, like, you know, music stuff has gone, so.

186
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,180
It's not worth it.

187
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:19,800
You know, it's really not worth it, but it is a step in the right direction, I guess,

188
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,240
with as far as pirating goes.

189
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,440
But really, who cares about pirating games, I mean, because most of the games suck.

190
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:32,880
But all you have to know is that I'm incredibly drunk right now, and that's really what counts.

191
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,520
Somebody stripped the caffeine out of Loki or something.

192
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:39,680
Honestly, folks, if I could feel better right now, that'd be great.

193
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,320
Anything you could do to make me feel better, that'd be great.

194
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:42,880
Remember, kids, don't break a drive.

195
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,400
I'll pass off the penguin mints.

196
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:44,900
All right.

197
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,800
Well, since we got some increased exposure,

198
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,120
we've actually been getting some letters on our mailbox, togo,

199
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,000
T-O-G-O, at orangeloungeradio.com.

200
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,240
And we thought we'd take a minute to read some letters.

201
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Yeah, let's open up the old Orange Lounge Radio letter bag.

202
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,200
Let's see, the first email that we have comes from

203
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:15,040
Sakurina wrote us an email saying that Sakurina was actually listening to one of our older

204
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:21,120
podcasts, the May 9th, 2005 podcast, and had some comments about the banning of violent

205
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,520
video games to minors.

206
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:28,960
Sakurina says, I am a minor and my parents follow and keep up with the ESRB rating system.

207
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:33,640
I've always kept up with the ESRB's rating system and I've followed it as much as possible.

208
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:38,720
In fact, I've never really played a mature game until Halo in 2001 when I was 10, and

209
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,880
I didn't find myself mature enough to play them, and I gave up on them until last year

210
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:48,400
when I purchased Metal Gear Solid, the Twin Snakes, my first mature game I ever purchased.

211
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:52,660
My parents actually ask me what I'm going to play, and they know how mature I am for

212
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:53,660
each kind of game.

213
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:56,240
In other words, not all parents are retards.

214
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:02,320
Good for your parents, but my comments were strictly in reference to the majority.

215
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,320
Yes.

216
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:07,600
again not all parents are retards we want to just reinforce that there

217
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,160
we there's some very intelligent parents out there and yours sound like that you

218
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,960
sound like an intelligent individual as well because you know what's good for

219
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,000
you and what's not

220
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,760
and we applaud those gamers that know how to distinguish

221
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:23,160
the gaming world from real life because they are people in Korea apparently

222
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,200
yeah as that story we had last week alright

223
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:30,560
let's go on to the second letter we got second letter we got was from

224
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,460
Warrior Bob

225
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:38,060
Warrior Bob was responding to something last week's show having to do with the ethical

226
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:42,040
Ethical miss of emulated games at the Kalani ethicality

227
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:45,060
Sorry, I need to go back to a grammar school

228
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:50,300
Warrior Bob says I think I'm somewhere between all your fine selves

229
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:57,740
I think it's perfectly okay to emulate something which is no longer easily available on the market out of print games like the pre

230
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:02,860
32-bit catalog, Japanese games never released here, etc.

231
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:06,300
In the case of the re-released Nintendo games, the situation has changed.

232
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:10,240
Now these games like Zelda and Metroid are easily available on the market, but the price

233
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,640
is somewhat questionable.

234
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:16,620
I think the emulation is valid with these titles, so long as an original NES copy is

235
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:17,620
owned.

236
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:22,060
The fact that the titles are selling shows that there exists a market, and as Jamie pointed

237
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:26,100
out, many people consider it worth the price to have a portable version of the game.

238
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:30,300
I know I, myself, bought a copy of the GBA Zelda re-release.

239
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,300
Mmm.

240
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:36,300
So, of course, you know, there's something to be said about the added value of the convenience

241
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:39,380
of having it in your GBA with all this complicated, emulated stuff.

242
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:44,640
My whole thing is, even with the re-releases, I don't think that they're anywhere near the

243
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:50,740
same as having the system hooked up to your TV, playing the original game on the original

244
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:54,060
damn controller, which is why I own so many freakin' video game systems.

245
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:57,180
all right well thank you guys for your letters again if you guys have any

246
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:01,600
emails out there you can always send us an email to go at orange lounge radio

247
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,100
calm all right let's get into some gaming news tonight we'll start it off

248
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:10,760
actually talking about the GBA and the DS this is interesting because the

249
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:18,280
website in 10 dojo is saying that 57,000 Nintendo DS's were sold in May to

250
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:23,120
American consumers Sony however is reporting that a quarter of a million

251
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:27,440
PSPs were shipped in the same month of course I don't know those stats to me

252
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,420
seem a little uneven because you have to remember the PSP was released later than

253
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:36,820
the DS so you know how many sold versus how many shipped that's true too I don't

254
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:39,300
know so it doesn't really account for all that however this is what's

255
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:45,340
interesting the GBA sold two hundred and thirty seven thousand units so it's out

256
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:49,140
selling the DS which is interesting do you think that's just because it's

257
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:52,620
cheaper, or people just aren't into the DS thing,

258
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,860
what do you think's up with that?

259
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:57,300
I think it has to do with both of those reasons, actually.

260
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,540
And also keep in mind the way marketing works for them,

261
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:03,880
at least in Japan, the DS is being sold as something

262
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:08,040
for adults, older people, whereas the GBA is for all ages.

263
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,460
And I have a feeling that their marketing is very similar

264
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:15,040
here, except they are taking advantage of the younger

265
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:15,880
market.

266
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,640
But what I don't get is that the DS, in many ways,

267
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:24,120
just like a GBA you can play your GBA games on the DS that's what I don't get

268
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:32,040
I don't know I'm using my DS as my GBA as well so our buddies over in Europe

269
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:36,600
there's a story being announced there that it the DS in Europe is sell has

270
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:41,680
sold 1 million units and that since the portable launched there three months ago

271
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:48,040
worldwide DS sales now at 6 million so it's taken off in Europe but you know

272
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:52,240
the PSP they're they're cracking down on the importing of the PSP's before it's

273
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,160
actually released out there and all this interesting stuff which should actually

274
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:58,680
be coming up in the next month or so yeah very soon so you guys don't have to

275
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:02,760
wait much longer for that let's talk about there was actually a lot of news

276
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:05,880
this week about MTV which I think is very interesting

277
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:14,140
m-t-a I know I know but MTV has formed their own MTV games unit MTV games is

278
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:19,440
devoted to quote developing producing and promoting unique and creative gaming

279
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:24,360
experiences that resonate with MTV's audience and this kind of falls in line

280
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:27,400
with another article that's been floating around in the music game

281
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:31,720
community saying that MTV is talking they want to get into the music games

282
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:37,240
but I can't help but think haven't MTV put out games already to some extent

283
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:40,000
like I remember there was a remote control generator game the music

284
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,400
generator games the remote control games on Nintendo but I'm thinking okay the

285
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:50,120
difference is is that those were games put out by other companies using the MTV

286
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:56,440
license now MTV wants to do their own thing so what do you think is it gonna

287
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:01,520
be commercially successful I mean let's face MTV huge marketing machine they

288
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:06,760
could free advertising crap crap are you saying that just because you're getting

289
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:10,440
older and jaded with MTV or do you truly believe there's something else here?

290
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,920
There's gonna be stupid children that's gonna buy it though.

291
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:20,600
MTV does not know how to market games, honestly. I mean they- I mean hello, look it's MTV a channel

292
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:28,200
itself. It's supposed to be music- music on their channel. It's all just stupid reality TV shows.

293
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:35,400
I mean hello. Road rules the game. Honestly folks, um, they might be able to market it as a game,

294
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,080
but I

295
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:42,420
Think it's gonna fail overall. That's way. I think it is. I thought this wasn't now

296
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:46,780
This is another this is another announcement that was made this week regarding MTV

297
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:50,580
MTV is actually going to partner up with midway games

298
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:55,680
They're going to jointly or basically what's gonna happen. It's gonna it's like a partnership for marketing

299
00:18:55,680 --> 00:19:03,240
They're gonna jointly sell in-game advertising and collaborating on the soundtracks and things like that now get this midway has la rush

300
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:07,200
right what they're gonna do is they're gonna take some branding from pimp my

301
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:13,500
ride on MTV and incorporate that into LA rush good for them me as long as they

302
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:18,440
get their game out there I mean whatever way they manage to do that that's good

303
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:22,520
for them works out for Midway because they get free marketing basically

304
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:28,280
honestly does that disgrace the LA rush rush brunch the rush franchise or no

305
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:33,360
You know, honestly, LA Rush wasn't that good of a game to begin with, I mean, I'd rather

306
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:39,080
see him pushing, you know, pin my ride aspect of that.

307
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,560
It's really sad that that game really sucked.

308
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:45,880
I mean, the problem is that- I don't mind LA Rush, it's alright.

309
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,880
It was okay!

310
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,760
I enjoyed, like, Hydro Thunder and Arctic Thunder, those were my midway games.

311
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,760
It was okay!

312
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:53,240
The problem was, it lost all the aspects of the Rush series.

313
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:58,060
I mean the rest series is basically like okay, you have like, you know set track that you go to

314
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:02,740
There's a few shortcuts and one line and there's some really cool, you know shortcuts

315
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:06,560
You can take that and you know involved like a lot of big jumps and one loops

316
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:11,980
But this new game, it's just like, you know, you don't really know where you're supposed to go

317
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:17,140
You just kind of follow a track and that's it. It wasn't as good as the original

318
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,860
All right, a dark Sakura any thoughts on this

319
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:25,860
It wasn't cool since Rush the Rock.

320
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:30,860
Alright, everybody has their own opinion. I'm sure you guys at home have yours as well.

321
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:35,860
Now we're going to get into the part of the show where we are going to better your life.

322
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:38,860
Because you know what? We can't play video games all day long.

323
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:39,860
Yes we can.

324
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:45,860
But if we stayed home and played video games all day long, we'd have no time to go out and drink responsibly.

325
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:48,860
Either that or we would let our four year old babies die.

326
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:55,280
yes so in order to help better your life we're here to offer you some advice to

327
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,340
help better your life in many ways and who better to bring that advice to you

328
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:03,340
than dark Sakura with her advice column

329
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:10,180
today's bit of advice is how to survive a fall onto subway tracks number one do

330
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:13,540
not attempt to climb back onto the platform unless you are positive you

331
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:18,840
have enough time to do so to find a safe place to stand out of the way of the

332
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,880
noncoming train.

333
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:27,140
Stand against a wall between columns separating two tracks on an adjoining set of tracks or

334
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:29,180
beneath the platform.

335
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:30,180
4.

336
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:34,660
Remove any articles of clothing or bags that could catch on the train and stand still,

337
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,660
straight, and tall.

338
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:37,540
Wait, I don't think that you're not supposed to jump on the platform.

339
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:38,540
What do you do?

340
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:41,780
You jump on the other tracks where the train isn't coming and hope you're right?

341
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:46,320
There's a middle section that has the pillars that hold the area up between where the alternating

342
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,440
tracks are.

343
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,820
Not every subway system.

344
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:52,820
every but there are many that do because I'm thinking about Bart Bart doesn't

345
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:56,460
have okay the picture you have shows okay I understand that but like Bart

346
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:00,300
doesn't have that so if I fall on the tracks on Bart I'm dead basically is

347
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:03,760
what you're saying yeah okay unless you can get your ass up all right so my

348
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:13,900
final piece of advice yes don't fucking ride the subway to hail a taxi but

349
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:17,460
subways are our New York friends can benefit from this piece of advice how

350
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,700
How about this?

351
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:21,860
Don't cross the yellow line, kids.

352
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:26,020
Each knee, each knee, Suicide Club, yo.

353
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:29,100
If you got that reference, hats off to you.

354
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,460
Da, da, da.

355
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:31,660
Big news this week.

356
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:36,340
It doesn't quite affect video gaming, per se.

357
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:38,880
But we know a lot of you guys are tech oriented,

358
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,540
and a lot of you guys probably do this.

359
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:42,120
You probably just don't talk about it.

360
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,420
But peer-to-peer networks.

361
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:47,020
There was this big Supreme Court ruling this week

362
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:50,340
that said Grokster and Streamcast Networks,

363
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:54,400
two big peer-to-peer services, could be held liable

364
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,500
for the actions of users utilizing

365
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,780
their peer-to-peer file sharing services.

366
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:02,380
I'm sure a lot of you guys have heard a lot about this story.

367
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,820
I'm curious what you guys think.

368
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:05,180
DarkSakura, what do you think about this,

369
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:07,260
this peer-to-peer ruling?

370
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,300
Do you think this is fair,

371
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,800
that Grokster should be held responsible

372
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,300
for what its users do with it?

373
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:19,360
Ultimately, they are providing the means, so legally, the service that provides the

374
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:25,740
means for the illegal activity has a right of responsibility.

375
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:30,740
They do have, they would basically be found negligent for allowing the misuse of their

376
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:31,740
material.

377
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:38,340
However, there is not a way to regulate this, which again, in the eyes of the court, would

378
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:45,340
B, you shouldn't offer this service, you know, don't operate your business, but again, that

379
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:49,640
takes money out of their pocket, you know, which, taking money out of the pocket of a

380
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:56,080
small business eventually will hurt the economy, therefore, they're basically treading on some

381
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,200
thin ice right here, the courts and the company.

382
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:06,200
So the courts probably looking at this as a way to hold them responsible as a party

383
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,240
while maintaining balance and industry.

384
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,480
I mean, if that makes sense to you.

385
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,880
Okay, okay, I'll follow you.

386
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,200
Again, I'm coming from having taken

387
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,600
that business law class.

388
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,840
All right, all right.

389
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,960
All right, moving on, my thoughts on this whole thing.

390
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,860
I think it really depends on how you're marketing

391
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:26,440
your peer-to-peer network.

392
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:29,120
I think if you're marketing your peer-to-peer network

393
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,900
as, you know, hey, come to our network

394
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:34,780
and trade your illegal MP3 files on our network,

395
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:37,760
then yes, I think you can be held responsible,

396
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,320
but I think if you're marketing your network

397
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:45,320
not as something that should be used for legit purposes,

398
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,900
the trading of open source programs or what have you,

399
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:51,120
and this is what you're encouraging your users to do

400
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:55,060
and you're discouraging your users via warnings

401
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:58,080
and other mechanisms to do the illegal thing,

402
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,240
then I don't see how they can hold you so responsible.

403
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,260
I kind of use this example.

404
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:03,840
It's like household cleaner.

405
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,440
You can't sue the people that make household cleaner

406
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,720
because you could theoretically kill someone with it

407
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,200
because they put warnings on the bottle that says,

408
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,960
hey, don't swallow this, dumb ass, right?

409
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,880
Actually, I have a case that I can repeat,

410
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,000
an Oklahoma case.

411
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,300
Okay.

412
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:23,920
The weed eater has a warning on it that says,

413
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:27,000
do not allow people under the age of,

414
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,800
believe that it was 15 years old,

415
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:34,640
within 20 feet of this machine while being operated.

416
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,800
Um, in this case, an uncle was weed eating the lawn.

417
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:42,120
The thing was fully on the machine.

418
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:46,400
Ten-year-old kids picking up dirt after it. The uncle,

419
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:50,880
the mom's, like, off doing something else. She's there but not observing her child.

420
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:55,840
The guy hits a rock with the weed eater, and this is the one with the metal blades.

421
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:00,700
It recoils goes backwards and slices off the child's arm at the elbow

422
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,900
now

423
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:08,700
We are looking at this as logical adults, who do you think would be a fault?

424
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:13,580
Cool adult

425
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:17,660
Would it be the uncle for his negligence? It would be the weed eater company

426
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:21,640
I think a bit child because they're down right the white, you know

427
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:25,900
I think it is in common sense it falls in one of those categories of accidents happen

428
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:30,540
You know just like it's like a car accidents happen. It's it's unfortunate, but it was an accident

429
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:34,860
I don't think anybody's liable in that case. That's what I that's my opinion is logical in the state of, Oklahoma

430
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:38,760
There are three cases for a company to be held liable for negligence

431
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:45,240
That's for default of the machine accident caused by said default to misuse of the of the item

432
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,280
The company was actually found at fault for Wow a default

433
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:57,120
But what a machine did not have. Now, taking that example, that poison notice on the bottle

434
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:02,920
of bleach isn't going to mean shit. Unless it is proven that the child swallowed the

435
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:09,040
item while the parent was negligent. And then it is the parent's fault. However, again.

436
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:13,200
Well, okay, tying this back to the peer-to-peer network thing before we lose too many people

437
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,040
in our analogies. Well, yeah, but I'm using it as-

438
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:22,340
No, I understand, I understand. But no, the MPAA or the RIAA is not going to, well I guess

439
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:26,880
they have been suing the individual users to some extent, but having very limited success

440
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,640
in doing so, and it's bad, bad PR for them too.

441
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:39,120
Oh yeah. Now, the way that this ties into the peer-to-peer. Peer-to-peer offers a service.

442
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:44,320
They do have the disclaimers on there that this is not to be used for X purposes, right?

443
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:51,320
of them. It depends on the network. Even those that have that notice on there, if their product

444
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:58,600
is being quote misused, they're still responsible. In the eyes of the court, they should still

445
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:04,520
be responsible. Now again, logically that doesn't make sense. Logically it should be

446
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:10,560
in the hands of the person who is misusing the product as long as the disclaimer exists.

447
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:14,720
Now another thing too is that when they download that service, thereís usually, and Iíve

448
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,540
studied this, thereís a click agreement.

449
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:22,320
By clicking that little box that says you agree to their terms of service, you are signing

450
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:26,680
a contract that says I will not misuse this item.

451
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:30,320
I will not do this for anything other than the specific purpose intended.

452
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,760
So even after all that, the companies could still be held liable?

453
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:39,640
I don't, I don't, if they are in the case that they have that as a full part of their

454
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:46,420
agreement and the parties violating the cert, violating that terms of service are, you know,

455
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:50,880
have placed that agreement, they're using their product and that clause exists, I do

456
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,660
not believe the company should be held liable.

457
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:53,880
They put it in there.

458
00:28:53,880 --> 00:29:01,400
It is the point of the user at that point of violating terms of service, which removes

459
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,060
negligence from the company.

460
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:07,940
Here's the reality how many people read that notice no it does nobody well maybe five people

461
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:13,140
five percent of the users of it maybe still how many people buy a house and don't read

462
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:18,240
their mortgage true i you know i work in a mortgage company how many freaking calls did

463
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:23,780
i get when i was in customer service why do i have a pre-payment penalty well didn't you

464
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:30,360
read your contract you had three days to change your fucking mind again pardon me for my rudeness

465
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:37,540
on that, but you people need to freaking read. You sign a contract, you need to read it,

466
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:42,960
and I think that in the case of those peer-to-peer networks, I think that they shouldn't be held

467
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:47,560
at fault at all. However, those who are too stupid to put that clause in there, oh yeah,

468
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,560
nail them. Seriously.

469
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:52,640
All right, many, many different perspectives on this issue, very hot button issue in the

470
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,280
community. If you have thoughts, we'd love to hear them.

471
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:58,660
Yeah, and I'm sorry for going off on the legal aspect of it. That's something that really

472
00:29:58,660 --> 00:29:59,660
I research.

473
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:04,100
want people to think about the different perspectives of looking at it. A lot of people are just

474
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:07,980
stomping their foot going, that's not fair, I want to keep downloading music for free,

475
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:12,820
it's not fair. But you have to look at, in the case of this, you have to really look

476
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:18,180
at the big picture to understand what's going on. And you know, the average gamer, I don't

477
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:23,900
think is going to do that. The average gamer is probably going to be, you know, what, teenage,

478
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:27,740
lower 20s, the average gamer.

479
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:30,960
To hugely generalize, yes. But they're not going to be

480
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:35,240
in the age group that is known for thinking about this type of thing.

481
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:39,280
You know, but if you're going to have an opinion,

482
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:43,120
it's a good idea to have an informed opinion as opposed to

483
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:47,400
stomping your foot and acting like an ignorant little child.

484
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:51,800
Sorry is the truth. And we're here to help educate you and think about the different positions.

485
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,640
about this proposition.

486
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,460
Exactly, exactly.

487
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:54,300
All right.

488
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:55,140
Let's move on.

489
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:55,960
We lost Loki.

490
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:56,800
No, that's all right.

491
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,340
Did Loki pass out finally?

492
00:30:58,340 --> 00:30:59,180
No.

493
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:00,000
You still with us, Loki?

494
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:00,840
No.

495
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,260
All right, he's still there a little bit.

496
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,660
All right, Loki, do you have a thought

497
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:04,500
on the peer-to-peer thing?

498
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,180
Can you get your microphone back up there?

499
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:09,140
We were going to get the opinion of the average drunk.

500
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:10,780
What are we talking about now?

501
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:12,420
Exactly.

502
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:16,140
Peer-to-peer network, Scott, said you can be held liable.

503
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:18,540
The Supreme Court says you, Grokster, can be held liable

504
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:19,780
because people misuse your service.

505
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:21,140
I've never heard of Grokster.

506
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:27,580
My thought is, you know what, honestly those peer-to-peer networks, they know that there's

507
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:30,900
illegal files being shared on there.

508
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:34,620
They're just doing the best they can to, you know, cover their asses.

509
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:41,860
So honestly, um, you don't need to go through, go through to find all the files that you're

510
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,620
looking for, so.

511
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:48,680
So you are bringing up this point that a lot of people say, when you squelch one problem,

512
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,680
it just gets bigger.

513
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:52,800
If they had never shut down Napster,

514
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,680
iTunes probably would be a lot more,

515
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,720
even though iTunes is having a lot of success now,

516
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,600
iTunes would probably be more successful

517
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:01,000
if it had showed up before they shut down Napster,

518
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,580
because people would have went from Napster to iTunes.

519
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,720
Instead, people went from Napster to,

520
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,280
well actually, and I take that back,

521
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:10,600
iTunes did exist in some form on the Mac only though,

522
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:14,360
but let's, you know, Mac only has a smaller share than PC.

523
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:18,880
I went from Napster to, what was that, music?

524
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:24,600
Audio grab or audio audio galaxy. I went to audio galaxy. Some people went to limewire Nutella

525
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,580
There was a lot from from that

526
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:33,560
I went to kaza and now I'm on the torrent and the problems getting worse and worse and I by the way am downloading files

527
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:38,220
Illegally, you know and if you come try to search through my computer Oh government

528
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:42,480
I'm going to fucking nail your ass to the goddamn wall and get you a fucking painting for

529
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:46,360
violation of privacy, uh-uh and violating my

530
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:50,600
I meant my rights under the Constitution.

531
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,000
Oh yeah, I'm gonna nail you if you pull that shit on me.

532
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,260
You do know anyone can listen to this podcast, right?

533
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:56,100
Oh, I don't care.

534
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:56,940
TwoGo at Orange Laundry.

535
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:57,840
They do it.

536
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:58,680
If you wanna send Jamie some fan mail.

537
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:01,720
We are on unregulated freaking radio.

538
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,680
I will nail you.

539
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,200
Wow, them's fighting words.

540
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,020
I don't care.

541
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:07,860
All right.

542
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:11,840
The BBC is running a story.

543
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,480
This story actually being linked from Slashdie.

544
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,720
Well, this is interesting.

545
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:20,680
BBC is running a story saying that women are going to explode onto the gaming scene any

546
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,120
minute now.

547
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:28,560
I just exploded on the gaming scene.

548
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,620
By the way, I'm not really downloading illegal files.

549
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:35,160
You can pretty much figure where the rest of this story is going, saying that online

550
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:41,720
role-playing games are doing good with women despite the subject matter, da-da-da.

551
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:49,080
Gaming gamers in the UK make up a quarter of the gaming population, 39% in the US, 69%

552
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,920
in South Korea.

553
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,400
Very interesting.

554
00:33:52,400 --> 00:34:00,000
So I don't know, Dark Sakura as a woman gamer, what do you think?

555
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:06,800
You know, I don't think it should matter, because that's just promoting discrimination

556
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,600
between genders.

557
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:18,760
I game, yes, I enjoy my Phantasy Star Online, I've been a week without it, but it doesn't

558
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,760
matter.

559
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:25,680
Why is there a stupid report about this freaking bullcrap when...

560
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:28,680
Because a lot of horny guys out there would have been gaming away.

561
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:34,200
Because you're like, oh my god, girls play video games, what does the freaking 21st century

562
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:37,120
get with the times, it doesn't need a study.

563
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:39,240
There were girls that played Atari.

564
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:40,080
Hello.

565
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,600
I played Atari, hello.

566
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:45,220
But admittedly, not as many women play games as guys.

567
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:46,760
Well, that needs to freaking change,

568
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:49,640
but you don't need a report to tell you this.

569
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:50,600
So what do they need to do?

570
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,440
Really quickly, what do they need to do?

571
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,920
They need to turn off their Xbox

572
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,760
and go out and meet people.

573
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,600
No, no, no, I'm not talking about that.

574
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,420
Get laid.

575
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:00,160
How do you get more women in games?

576
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,560
Is it the type of games they're putting out?

577
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,040
Is it the way they market them?

578
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,560
Is it just society stigma?

579
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:11,920
think the average woman interest is ridiculous. They need, like, Cosmo the game.

580
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:17,280
So Paris Hilton needs to put out a video game. I guess. You know, how to be a social whore.

581
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,740
But the rest of... no gamer would ever take a game like that seriously. Just like Mary

582
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:24,640
Kate and Ashley learned to drive or whatever, Sweet Sixteen are the laughing stock of the

583
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:28,520
gaming world. Yeah. Well, the thing is that I play freakin'

584
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:31,380
ragnarok and ragnarok's cutesy

585
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:34,840
but i played you know final fantasy eleven i played

586
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:37,080
you know fantasy star online

587
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:40,480
i played halo until i found out it made me motion sick

588
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:44,400
you know my favorite game of all time is freaking guardian legend

589
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:48,900
which is one of the one of the single hardest of video games ever

590
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:49,880
you know

591
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:52,060
i played abadox

592
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:55,480
which was supposed to be the most gory video game when it came out

593
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,680
you're too special though

594
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:57,640
That's what it boils down to.

595
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:01,040
I am a true gamer woman.

596
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,080
I feel sorry, though, for other women

597
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:07,200
to have me as the voice of the gaming community.

598
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,080
I like the violent stuff.

599
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:09,760
All right.

600
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,320
Who's the game?

601
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,000
Couple more stories here, you guys.

602
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,280
PlayStation 3 will not be coming out with a hard drive.

603
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,080
Xbox 360, they are saying they're

604
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,560
going to do a 20 gig hard drive.

605
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,240
PlayStation 3, nope.

606
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,280
Not coming with it.

607
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:25,840
There will be a slot where you can put in an 80 gig hard drive

608
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:26,620
a little later on.

609
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:28,380
but no hard drive in the outset.

610
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:30,980
To me, this is kind of striking me as these stories

611
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,500
are really kind of a bigger deal

612
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,620
than I think they ought to be.

613
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:36,220
I think it just really depends on the games

614
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:37,740
that are coming out.

615
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:41,140
If the games come out and they don't require a hard drive,

616
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:42,700
because none of the games they have out right now

617
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:45,380
really require a hard drive console-wise,

618
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:48,580
save maybe Final Fantasy XI, a couple other exceptions,

619
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,020
that's all you need.

620
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:53,020
That's all the gaming system needs to be successful

621
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:55,820
are good games, right?

622
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:57,860
It really should only be the games that matter.

623
00:36:57,860 --> 00:37:00,620
But this story's been running on every gaming website, and it's kind of like,

624
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:03,960
oh no, PlayStation 3, you're not going to have a hard drive.

625
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,460
So?

626
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:08,820
We didn't have a hard drive before the PS2.

627
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:11,220
Why does it matter?

628
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:11,980
Don't know.

629
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,300
Yeah, the memory card.

630
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:14,700
I think it's interesting.

631
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:20,340
The only good that my hard drive is for is for my HD loader.

632
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:22,460
And I only use it for that.

633
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:27,260
And really, the only other reason to have that is for, like, what, the Endless Mode in Beatmania?

634
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:30,660
And for, uh, Final Fantasy XI.

635
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:31,160
Hm.

636
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,160
That's it.

637
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:42,460
Another news story, uh, a recent blog updated by a Japanese voice actor, Koji Tsujitani.

638
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:48,460
Uh, he is a video game voice actor, and he contributed to Xenosaga, and he said in his blog,

639
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:49,840
I'm doing another one.

640
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:53,640
So he kind of let the cat out of the bag that there was a Xenosaga 3 on the way.

641
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,160
I think we kind of figured that.

642
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,800
Yeah, I think we kind of figured that.

643
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:01,680
Namco, by the way, not making any official statement on that, but in the blog it says

644
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:06,300
he has begun recording work for the next installment in the series.

645
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:09,880
Kind of not a big surprise, but I'm sure a lot of fans will be happy to know that yes,

646
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:12,320
it is indeed happening.

647
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:18,520
lastly tonight a story about a gaming company called left-behind games you

648
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:23,440
might know the term left-behind it's a famous book series that's big in the

649
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:28,680
Christian and religious world it's a it's about what happened after the

650
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:32,160
rapture basically and those folks that were left behind after the rapture yeah

651
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:40,480
burning hell well get this they are they're making a PC game based on those

652
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,880
novels

653
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:46,120
that's right i i don't know how that's going to work

654
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:50,880
but it seems like now now a lot of sites out there on blogs is are saying that

655
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:55,280
between this and you saw at e three natsumi had made the bible game which

656
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,160
was like jeopardy for bibles

657
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:00,640
it's kinda like christian gaming is making this big come back you know it

658
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,120
didn't we already have a matrix

659
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:07,920
i wish that by matrix to come out in the states honestly i mean

660
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:12,740
Go ahead make a Bible game. I mean what not I mean people are gonna play it

661
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:18,920
And you've got the small following that you know follows the whole you know left behind series and whatnot

662
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:26,180
Go ahead. If you think you're gonna make some money off of it. You know more power to you, but if you know if it fails

663
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:30,540
No, we just told you so here's here's my last question to you guys

664
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:37,060
And then we'll wrap up the show is this a good thing or a bad thing for gaming or does it strictly depend on?

665
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:39,060
on how the game is?

666
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:11,640
following have for this type of thing really other than that you know that's

667
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:16,540
the only thing that's going to be depending on how good it's going to be. I mean, because if you have a good

668
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:18,260
following behind it it's going to be good

669
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:22,260
otherwise it's going to suck. I, you know what, I say it's a good thing for gaming

670
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:25,780
because it'll keep, it'll take people's attention, certain people who need their

671
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:29,340
attention taken away from games like Grand Theft Auto and because there's

672
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:32,380
people out there they seriously are in this mindset that all video games are

673
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:37,580
violent all video games are violent no no no video games movies art in any form

674
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:43,460
the freaking news oh I'm on my thot art in any form is what you want it to be

675
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:49,380
and as far if this can show people a certain people that need to see this and

676
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:53,340
I'm not saying that everybody every Christian needs to see that's not that's

677
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:56,980
not what I'm saying I'm saying certain hardcore people that are out there that

678
00:40:56,980 --> 00:41:00,900
are saying like video games are just they're all violent they're all

679
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:05,620
plaguing society if this will help people see that not all video games have

680
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:10,940
to be violent then I say it's a good thing yeah you know this is what I say

681
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:18,380
being an artist myself the goal of an artist in the end is to provoke a

682
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:24,980
reaction whether you are offended by it whether you don't like it whether you'd

683
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:30,780
love it have a positive reaction getting that reaction getting feedback on

684
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:35,700
on that reaction that is a goal of an artist because they know that their work

685
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:40,860
be it a video game be it a piece of visual art or written they know that

686
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:47,220
their piece created that response apathy is the worst thing an artist can have so

687
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:51,220
then are we in agreement that video game creators are in fact artists I do agree

688
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:57,900
Loki to a certain extent I I would assume but you know I mean it's like go

689
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:01,860
crazy and assume that they're artists just because they create a video game I

690
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:06,860
think I think it's I think it's art just in another form in a sense I mean let's

691
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:11,560
not go crazy with just seeing you have writing involved it's you have art

692
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:16,620
involved it's not a Mona Lisa okay no it's it's an art form it's not a way

693
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:20,140
the art is art art is a way of expressing yourself right it's a

694
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:24,300
combination of visual art I'd be willing to go that far it's a combination of

695
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:29,280
visual arc dramatic arts you know because you've got the acting that goes

696
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:34,340
into the game the storytelling aspect of it and you also have the the audio arts

697
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:40,900
because you have music in the games it is an overall work of art some very deep

698
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:45,380
subjects tonight I'm a fantasy is this a is this a like post drunken lethargic

699
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:52,260
talk or something I don't know if I have no freaking clue how we've been talking

700
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:55,260
The legal chatter thing got my brain working.

701
00:42:55,260 --> 00:43:00,260
If you were to ask me what we talked about in this podcast, I would have no clue.

702
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:02,260
You can listen to it all week long and hear what an ass you were.

703
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:05,260
You could wake up tomorrow going, why am I wearing this shirt?

704
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:08,260
Yeah, honestly, I don't know where the hell these pants came from.

705
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:11,260
Those are actually my pants, because you threw up on the other ones.

706
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:12,260
Okay.

707
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:16,260
Anyway, let's wrap up the show, please.

And ribbons and bows.

709
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:20,260
The video games are a good thing to end on.

710
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:24,360
Loki throwing up on himself not so good a note to end on so let's go video games

711

712
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:34,480
my final thought is I need the pace myself with as far as drinking goes and

713
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:39,220
maybe next time you know ice would be a little bit better in my drinks because

714
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:44,160
you know the warm drinks aren't that great but I don't know I I was able to

715
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:47,680
handle my alcohol a lot better in San Diego and I don't know why but I guess

716
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:54,680
were just depend on the alcohol but I don't know yeah my final thought is I'm
