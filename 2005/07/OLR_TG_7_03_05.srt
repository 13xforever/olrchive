[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of July 4th, 2005.

2
00:00:03,232 --> 00:00:13,884
[SPEAKER_00]: You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.

3
00:00:14,144 --> 00:00:17,568
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.

4
00:00:19,406 --> 00:00:29,954
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, everybody, and welcome to another edition of our podcast, Your Home, dedicated to video games and video gaming, most notably the games that don't suck.

5
00:00:30,495 --> 00:00:31,395
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Rob Roberts.

6
00:00:31,415 --> 00:00:32,436
[SPEAKER_02]: You might know me as Sky.

7
00:00:32,496 --> 00:00:36,819
[SPEAKER_02]: Joining me as always, my awesome co-host, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

8
00:00:36,859 --> 00:00:37,360
[SPEAKER_02]: There she is.

9
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:38,361
[SPEAKER_03]: Cheerio, loves.

10
00:00:38,941 --> 00:00:39,762
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you doing, hon?

11
00:00:42,404 --> 00:00:42,904
[SPEAKER_03]: Recovering.

12
00:00:43,064 --> 00:00:45,626
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we'll talk about what's been going on here in a little bit.

13
00:00:46,067 --> 00:00:49,129
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the other corner, the one and only TechMazzaLoki.

14
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:51,746
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, how you doing?

15
00:00:51,826 --> 00:00:52,508
[SPEAKER_02]: Holding up okay?

16
00:00:54,281 --> 00:00:57,222
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

17
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:26,686
[SPEAKER_02]: We did a little bit of drinking.

18
00:01:26,706 --> 00:01:27,450
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit.

19
00:01:28,502 --> 00:01:30,782
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're recovering from that right now.

20
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:37,184
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki more so than anybody because he had a little experience with my toilet, needless to say.

21
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:38,144
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just leave it at that.

22
00:01:38,164 --> 00:01:41,085
[SPEAKER_02]: He was bowed down before the porcelain goddess.

23
00:01:41,225 --> 00:01:41,925
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

24
00:01:42,345 --> 00:01:43,625
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura and I, we're fine.

25
00:01:44,085 --> 00:01:45,745
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember, kids, don't drink and drive.

26
00:01:45,846 --> 00:01:47,686
[SPEAKER_02]: We're doing this because we have designated drivers.

27
00:01:47,706 --> 00:01:48,566
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't drink and date.

28
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:49,646
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good rating.

29
00:01:49,686 --> 00:01:50,867
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, don't drink and date.

30
00:01:50,927 --> 00:01:51,767
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the especially important thing.

31
00:01:51,787 --> 00:01:53,367
[SPEAKER_03]: That might get you in a bit more trouble.

32
00:01:53,407 --> 00:01:56,108
[SPEAKER_02]: However, drinking and DDR is okay.

33
00:01:56,128 --> 00:01:57,428
[SPEAKER_03]: It's funny as hell.

34
00:01:58,328 --> 00:01:59,308
[SPEAKER_03]: I've played DDR Drunk.

35
00:01:59,469 --> 00:02:01,189
[SPEAKER_02]: I did Vegas once, I remember.

36
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:03,290
[SPEAKER_02]: Of all places, I was playing DDR Drunk.

37
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:05,491
[SPEAKER_02]: I just remember feeling very heavy.

38
00:02:05,671 --> 00:02:06,892
[SPEAKER_03]: My choker's choking me.

39
00:02:07,372 --> 00:02:07,632
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

40
00:02:08,272 --> 00:02:11,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, let's talk about our gaming weeks.

41
00:02:11,394 --> 00:02:15,015
[SPEAKER_02]: Before we get into the gaming news here on Orange Launch Radio, we always talk about our gaming weeks.

42
00:02:15,115 --> 00:02:17,136
[SPEAKER_02]: Starting off with the one and only DarkSakura.

43
00:02:17,156 --> 00:02:19,877
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you got your move done, so you got a chance to play any games this week?

44
00:02:19,957 --> 00:02:20,737
[SPEAKER_03]: We did move.

45
00:02:21,138 --> 00:02:26,320
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't played any games except the Potato Peeler on Gorillas.com and, of course, Widescreen Pong.

46
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,682
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so, uh, we did, however, purchase a 50-inch HD widescreen TV.

47
00:02:31,762 --> 00:02:34,164
[SPEAKER_02]: I was gonna say, you have a sweet new gamer rig, if nothing else.

48
00:02:34,284 --> 00:02:39,146
[SPEAKER_03]: As soon as we pick up some, uh, component cables, I'm gonna be freaking trying out 2DX on that.

49
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:41,987
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that the first game you're gonna try on there, is Beatmania 2DX?

50
00:02:42,008 --> 00:02:43,468
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell yeah.

51
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:44,509
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

52
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:46,048
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds good to me.

53
00:02:47,729 --> 00:02:49,390
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got a sweet gaming rig, it sounds like.

54
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:52,932
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a better gaming rig than anybody else I know, so we're definitely going to have to go over there.

55
00:02:53,172 --> 00:02:57,974
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have to do a podcast over there at some point on your sweet new 50-inch TV.

56
00:02:57,994 --> 00:03:06,217
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually added the laptop to it, and we tried to watch Tokyo Breakfast, and it wouldn't load, so we watched The Deadly Negro.

57
00:03:07,578 --> 00:03:08,078
[SPEAKER_02]: Amazing.

58
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:08,899
[SPEAKER_02]: What is that?

59
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:09,459
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know it.

60
00:03:09,801 --> 00:03:15,762
[SPEAKER_03]: It's this guy who basically screams and yells motherfucker a lot to Afronova.

61
00:03:16,603 --> 00:03:18,043
[SPEAKER_03]: But the second one is funny.

62
00:03:18,143 --> 00:03:19,924
[SPEAKER_02]: Where can you get that from?

63
00:03:19,984 --> 00:03:22,444
[SPEAKER_03]: Totallycracked.com Sounds appropriate.

64
00:03:23,424 --> 00:03:27,785
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, you look a little dazed and confused right now, but can you tell us about your gaming week?

65
00:03:28,726 --> 00:03:29,386
[SPEAKER_02]: Make it coherent.

66
00:03:30,851 --> 00:03:34,936
[SPEAKER_01]: Miami Week is mainly Destroy All Humans.

67
00:03:34,996 --> 00:03:36,999
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty much all we've been playing this week.

68
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,523
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually did finish the game itself.

69
00:03:41,365 --> 00:03:46,231
[SPEAKER_01]: It is pretty simplistic other than, you know,

70
00:03:47,045 --> 00:03:50,768
[SPEAKER_01]: Destroying All Humans, but it's a lot of fun.

71
00:03:50,828 --> 00:03:55,991
[SPEAKER_01]: They have the voice actor that does Invader Zim in it, so you gotta love that.

72
00:03:56,332 --> 00:04:00,475
[SPEAKER_01]: And other than that, it's a lot of fun, so definitely check it out.

73
00:04:00,915 --> 00:04:03,997
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't you say you got to take a sneak peek at some new PSP game?

74
00:04:04,437 --> 00:04:05,899
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I have a PSP.

75
00:04:06,559 --> 00:04:12,543
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm borrowing the PSP version of... What was it?

76
00:04:12,643 --> 00:04:12,944
[SPEAKER_01]: It was...

77
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:17,786
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you're drunk, but think.

78
00:04:17,886 --> 00:04:18,387
[SPEAKER_01]: Think hard.

79
00:04:19,367 --> 00:04:20,008
[SPEAKER_01]: Think hard.

80
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:28,334
[SPEAKER_01]: No, honestly, it's... I don't remember.

81
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:30,596
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically... It's a lot of fun.

82
00:04:30,616 --> 00:04:33,297
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't even remember what the name of the game is.

83
00:04:39,702 --> 00:04:40,903
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but honestly, it's...

84
00:04:44,594 --> 00:04:45,595
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even remember.

85
00:04:46,176 --> 00:04:46,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, forget it.

86
00:04:47,398 --> 00:04:49,681
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some new PSP game that's coming out.

87
00:04:49,741 --> 00:04:50,522
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't believe that.

88
00:04:50,542 --> 00:04:51,283
[SPEAKER_01]: Dead to Rights.

89
00:04:51,303 --> 00:04:52,424
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.

90
00:04:52,464 --> 00:04:53,045
[SPEAKER_01]: Dead to Rights.

91
00:04:53,085 --> 00:04:54,327
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Dead to Rights.

92
00:04:55,929 --> 00:04:56,830
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been playing that.

93
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:00,514
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically like Dead to Rights 2, but it's for the PSP.

94
00:05:00,575 --> 00:05:01,516
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got the dog.

95
00:05:01,616 --> 00:05:02,377
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot of fun.

96
00:05:03,295 --> 00:05:14,721
[SPEAKER_01]: um definitely check it out if you've got PSP because honestly there's not that much out right now it's for the PSP so PSP is suffering from what DS was suffering from like yeah exactly PSP syndrome basically

97
00:05:15,433 --> 00:05:16,633
[SPEAKER_01]: DS Syndrome Bullet Time Effect

98
00:05:38,243 --> 00:05:42,224
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, since the Matrix, um... Is it still cool?

99
00:05:42,284 --> 00:05:43,044
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I want to know.

100
00:05:43,364 --> 00:05:44,805
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, hell yeah, it's still cool.

101
00:05:44,885 --> 00:05:45,905
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, just check it out.

102
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:47,886
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot of fun, honestly.

103
00:05:48,186 --> 00:05:59,129
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but if you really want to, you know, save some money and stuff, just download the Genesis emulators and whatnot and, um, play those because they don't cost anything and it's a lot of fun.

104
00:06:00,149 --> 00:06:06,851
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, definitely if you're out there buying PSP games, don't do it while you're drunk because, um...

105
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:11,617
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, you're going to be spending money on stuff that you shouldn't be spending money on.

106
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:13,538
[SPEAKER_01]: Take it from me, okay?

107
00:06:13,578 --> 00:06:16,598
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I'm, you know... Because you drink and go shopping all the time.

108
00:06:16,718 --> 00:06:18,619
[SPEAKER_01]: I drink and go shopping, yeah, exactly.

109
00:06:19,059 --> 00:06:21,300
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, you become sober and you're like, what the hell?

110
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,240
[SPEAKER_01]: Why did I buy this?

111
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:30,422
[SPEAKER_01]: So, honestly, folks, if you're drunk, just, you know, seriously, just, you know, make your peace with the porcelain god and...

112
00:06:31,421 --> 00:06:32,121
[SPEAKER_01]: Take it from there.

113
00:06:32,621 --> 00:06:34,802
[SPEAKER_02]: You're being a lethargic drunk tonight, I think.

114
00:06:35,082 --> 00:06:36,062
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very interesting.

115
00:06:38,382 --> 00:06:44,543
[SPEAKER_01]: I've already thrown up about four times over the porcelain god, as you would put it.

116
00:06:44,923 --> 00:06:47,184
[SPEAKER_01]: Kneel down before the porcelain goddess.

117
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:56,745
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never actually thrown up while I've been drunk, so I've hit a whole new level of drunkenness.

118
00:06:56,785 --> 00:06:57,686
[SPEAKER_01]: Take it from me, though.

119
00:06:58,006 --> 00:06:59,766
[SPEAKER_01]: The PSP game version of...

120
00:07:00,766 --> 00:07:08,139
[SPEAKER_01]: Dead of the Rights is pretty cool, so I definitely recommend checking it out, but honestly, try it before you buy it.

121
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,225
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't go out and buy these PSP games, because

122
00:07:11,769 --> 00:07:12,450
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching!

123
00:07:31,673 --> 00:07:39,535
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what the DS is all about, you guys, because the touchscreen adds so much to this game, because it allows the game to be fast-paced.

124
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:42,775
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you move your blocks literally with the stylus.

125
00:07:43,656 --> 00:07:47,917
[SPEAKER_02]: You can play this game with the controller and the button, but it would not work.

126
00:07:47,977 --> 00:07:51,177
[SPEAKER_02]: Having to swap the bricks one at a time, it just would not work the same.

127
00:07:51,477 --> 00:07:56,779
[SPEAKER_02]: But having a stylus where you can drag your blocks up and down... Because the interesting thing about Meteos, you can't move them left and right.

128
00:07:56,819 --> 00:07:58,739
[SPEAKER_02]: You only move your blocks up and down, which is kind of weird.

129
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,108
[SPEAKER_02]: It adds this whole new dimension to a puzzle game.

130
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,094
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't explain it, but it makes it very fast-paced.

131
00:08:04,475 --> 00:08:05,558
[SPEAKER_02]: Meteos is very cool.

132
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:06,440
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it because...

133
00:08:07,213 --> 00:08:16,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Being kind of a short attention gamer, or a gamer ADD, as I sometimes call it, where sometimes I only want to play a game for 5-10 minutes, Meteos works out really well for me.

134
00:08:17,981 --> 00:08:20,043
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people have been comparing this game to Luminous.

135
00:08:20,123 --> 00:08:22,064
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, of course, it's the same company, same developer.

136
00:08:22,505 --> 00:08:29,430
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say the music and graphics aren't quite what they are in Luminous, but I think that's just a system holdback.

137
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:35,915
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, obviously on the PSP, which is more CD-based, you're going to get better music, and you get stuff like the Mondo Grosso track, Shinin', whatever.

138
00:08:36,455 --> 00:08:38,476
[SPEAKER_02]: It works out better for that.

139
00:08:38,576 --> 00:08:43,678
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's not to knock Meteos because it's an incredible concept for a game.

140
00:08:43,998 --> 00:08:47,539
[SPEAKER_02]: And the type of game it is, you could not do on the PSP because of the touchscreen and everything.

141
00:08:48,219 --> 00:08:55,542
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely, if you're a DS owner, if you like puzzle games to any extent, if you went out and bought Puyo Puyo Fever or you bought any other puzzler, Polarium.

142
00:08:55,842 --> 00:08:58,543
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, if you wasted the money on Polarium, trust me, you're going to love Meteos.

143
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:01,424
[SPEAKER_02]: It redeems DS puzzlers by quite a bit.

144
00:09:01,524 --> 00:09:02,464
[SPEAKER_02]: So I highly recommend it.

145
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:03,504
[SPEAKER_02]: That's been the game I've been playing.

146
00:09:03,524 --> 00:09:05,005
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still waiting for lecture, Plankton.

147
00:09:05,828 --> 00:09:08,069
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking forward to Electroplank and, of course, Nintendogs.

148
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:09,170
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll see.

149
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:10,331
[SPEAKER_03]: I got my puppies ordered.

150
00:09:11,792 --> 00:09:12,492
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you getting the U.S.

151
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:13,252
[SPEAKER_02]: or Japanese one?

152
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:14,833
[SPEAKER_03]: The U.S.

153
00:09:15,113 --> 00:09:17,655
[SPEAKER_03]: I know a lot of folks... Because I can get it at a 30% off discount.

154
00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:21,267
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's get into some gaming news.

155
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:37,137
[SPEAKER_02]: First off though, I just want to welcome those of you guys that are subscribed to us through iTunes now, because iTunes 4.9 rolled out earlier, actually last week, as you probably know that, and a lot of folks finding Orange Lounge Radio thanks to that, doing a search for video games and finding us.

156
00:09:37,497 --> 00:09:39,478
[SPEAKER_02]: So a big hello to you guys, hope you enjoy the show.

157
00:09:40,119 --> 00:09:43,021
[SPEAKER_02]: Just remember, we're a little out of it tonight, so this...

158
00:09:43,661 --> 00:09:52,743
[SPEAKER_02]: This isn't quite representative of our normal perky selves, but darn it, we are giving you a podcast every week.

159
00:09:52,903 --> 00:09:55,564
[SPEAKER_02]: Come hell or high water, and I think this just proves it.

160
00:09:55,604 --> 00:09:57,825
[SPEAKER_02]: Or lots of booze.

161
00:09:58,045 --> 00:10:01,625
[SPEAKER_03]: I still can't believe I out-drunk Loki, and I'm more sober.

162
00:10:03,426 --> 00:10:06,367
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to ask you if anything's going on in the hack and crack scene.

163
00:10:06,387 --> 00:10:07,647
[SPEAKER_02]: In a couple sentences, anything?

164
00:10:12,506 --> 00:10:18,072
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the 1.5 version PSP stuff, but that was released last week.

165
00:10:18,693 --> 00:10:27,002
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than that, really the only thing to mention is the loader for the Luminous is available for the PSP.

166
00:10:28,732 --> 00:10:33,414
[SPEAKER_01]: So that means there's going to be more PSP games that they're actually running the ROMs for.

167
00:10:33,654 --> 00:10:37,056
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's kind of a gray area because that's piracy flat out, really.

168
00:10:37,096 --> 00:10:42,238
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that is piracy, but that's pretty much the big thing that's going on in the PSP world.

169
00:10:42,398 --> 00:10:50,141
[SPEAKER_02]: But if I'm not mistaken, wouldn't these versions of Luminous or whatever that you load on your memory stick, wouldn't they have stripped graphics?

170
00:10:50,201 --> 00:10:51,202
[SPEAKER_02]: Typically like a lot of...

171
00:10:52,422 --> 00:10:52,782
[SPEAKER_02]: What was it?

172
00:10:52,822 --> 00:10:53,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Dreamcast.

173
00:10:53,502 --> 00:10:56,763
[SPEAKER_02]: When they were trying to put those on CDs, they would sometimes have to strip out some of the audio.

174
00:10:57,284 --> 00:11:01,105
[SPEAKER_02]: Luminous, if you strip out the audio and some of the graphics, it's not going to be the same game.

175
00:11:02,065 --> 00:11:04,566
[SPEAKER_02]: The audio is essential to a game like Luminous.

176
00:11:04,606 --> 00:11:09,807
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what they're doing so far, but so far the thing that's being stripped out is all the audio.

177
00:11:10,408 --> 00:11:11,228
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not worth it.

178
00:11:11,248 --> 00:11:16,029
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really not worth it, but it is a step in the right direction, I guess, as far as pirating goes.

179
00:11:22,071 --> 00:11:24,133
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, who cares about pirating games?

180
00:11:24,153 --> 00:11:25,594
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, because most of the games suck.

181
00:11:26,215 --> 00:11:32,661
[SPEAKER_01]: But all you have to know is that I'm incredibly drunk right now, and that's really what counts.

182
00:11:32,681 --> 00:11:35,543
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody strip the caffeine out of Loki or something.

183
00:11:35,663 --> 00:11:39,367
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, folks, if I could feel better right now, that would be great.

184
00:11:39,867 --> 00:11:42,890
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything you could do to make me feel better, that would be great.

185
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,171
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll pass off the penguin mints.

186
00:11:44,491 --> 00:11:44,771
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

187
00:11:47,023 --> 00:11:57,451
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, since we got some increased exposure, we've actually been getting some letters on our mailbox, togo, T-O-G-O, at orangeloungeradio.com, and we thought we'd take a minute to read some letters.

188
00:12:01,034 --> 00:12:03,636
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, let's open up the old Orange Lounge Radio letter bag.

189
00:12:05,049 --> 00:12:22,057
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, first email that we have comes from Sakurina, wrote us an email saying that Sakurina was actually listening to one of our older podcasts, the May 9th, 2005 podcast, and had some comments about the banning of violent video games to minors.

190
00:12:22,757 --> 00:12:28,500
[SPEAKER_02]: Sakurina says, I am a minor, and my parents follow and keep up with the ESRB rating system.

191
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:33,223
[SPEAKER_02]: I've always kept up with the ESRB's rating system, and I've followed it as much as possible.

192
00:12:33,624 --> 00:12:40,769
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, I've never really played a mature game until Halo in 2001 when I was 10, and I didn't find myself mature enough to play them.

193
00:12:41,129 --> 00:12:47,894
[SPEAKER_02]: And I gave up on them until last year when I purchased Metal Gear Solid The Twin Snakes, my first mature game I ever purchased.

194
00:12:48,374 --> 00:12:53,502
[SPEAKER_02]: My parents actually ask me what I'm going to play, and they know how mature I am for each kind of game.

195
00:12:53,862 --> 00:12:56,426
[SPEAKER_02]: In other words, not all parents are retards.

196
00:12:56,967 --> 00:13:02,274
[SPEAKER_03]: Good for your parents, but my comments were strictly in reference to the majority.

197
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:05,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, not all parents are retards.

198
00:13:05,997 --> 00:13:07,457
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to just reinforce that there.

199
00:13:07,957 --> 00:13:10,998
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some very intelligent parents out there, and yours sound like that.

200
00:13:11,018 --> 00:13:14,900
[SPEAKER_02]: And you sound like an intelligent individual as well, because you know what's good for you and what's not.

201
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:21,121
[SPEAKER_02]: And we applaud those gamers that know how to distinguish the gaming world from real life.

202
00:13:21,222 --> 00:13:22,942
[SPEAKER_03]: And like people in Korea, apparently.

203
00:13:23,562 --> 00:13:25,303
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's that story we had last week.

204
00:13:25,803 --> 00:13:28,544
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's go on to the second letter we got.

205
00:13:28,664 --> 00:13:31,885
[SPEAKER_02]: Second letter we got was from Warrior Bob.

206
00:13:32,685 --> 00:13:40,767
[SPEAKER_02]: Warrior Bob was responding to something last week's show having to do with the ethicalness of emulated games.

207
00:13:40,847 --> 00:13:41,387
[SPEAKER_02]: Ethicality.

208
00:13:41,447 --> 00:13:42,087
[SPEAKER_02]: Ethicality.

209
00:13:43,047 --> 00:13:45,108
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I need to go back to grammar school.

210
00:13:46,508 --> 00:13:50,329
[SPEAKER_02]: Warrior Bob says, I think I'm somewhere between all your fine selves.

211
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:58,851
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's perfectly okay to emulate something which is no longer easily available on the market out of print games like the pre-32-bit catalog.

212
00:13:59,249 --> 00:14:01,711
[SPEAKER_02]: Japanese games never released here, etc.

213
00:14:02,812 --> 00:14:05,894
[SPEAKER_02]: In the case of the re-released Nintendo games, the situation has changed.

214
00:14:06,254 --> 00:14:11,318
[SPEAKER_02]: Now these games like Zelda and Metroid are easily available on the market, but the price is somewhat questionable.

215
00:14:11,698 --> 00:14:16,702
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the emulation is valid with these titles, so long as an original NES copy is owned.

216
00:14:17,182 --> 00:14:20,546
[SPEAKER_02]: The fact that the titles are selling shows that there exists a market.

217
00:14:20,846 --> 00:14:25,771
[SPEAKER_02]: And as Jamie pointed out, many people consider it worth the price to have a portable version of the game.

218
00:14:26,172 --> 00:14:29,956
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I myself bought a copy of the GBA Zelda re-release.

219
00:14:31,398 --> 00:14:39,066
[SPEAKER_02]: So, of course, you know, there's something to be said about the added value of the convenience of having it in your GBA with all this complicated emulated stuff.

220
00:14:39,326 --> 00:14:39,707
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

221
00:14:54,725 --> 00:14:56,226
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well thank you guys for your letters.

222
00:14:56,287 --> 00:15:02,352
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, if you guys have any emails out there, you can always send us an email to go at orangeloungeradio.com.

223
00:15:02,392 --> 00:15:04,093
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's get into some gaming news tonight.

224
00:15:04,434 --> 00:15:09,358
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll start it off actually talking about the GBA and the DS.

225
00:15:09,738 --> 00:15:19,407
[SPEAKER_02]: This is interesting because the website Nintendojo is saying that 57,000 Nintendo DSs were sold in May to American consumers.

226
00:15:19,887 --> 00:15:21,568
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, how many sold versus how many shipped?

227
00:15:35,877 --> 00:15:36,557
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true, too.

228
00:15:36,637 --> 00:15:36,958
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

229
00:15:37,018 --> 00:15:38,118
[SPEAKER_02]: So it doesn't really account for all that.

230
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:39,739
[SPEAKER_02]: However, this is what's interesting.

231
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:43,700
[SPEAKER_02]: The GBA sold 237,000 units.

232
00:15:44,961 --> 00:15:48,202
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's outselling the DS, which is interesting.

233
00:15:48,222 --> 00:15:52,424
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that's just because it's cheaper or people just aren't into the DS thing?

234
00:15:52,464 --> 00:15:53,264
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think's up with that?

235
00:15:53,964 --> 00:15:56,065
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it has to do with both of those reasons, actually.

236
00:15:57,225 --> 00:16:00,727
[SPEAKER_03]: And also keep in mind the way marketing works for them, at least in Japan.

237
00:16:01,345 --> 00:16:01,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of them.

238
00:16:26,481 --> 00:16:26,861
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

239
00:16:27,241 --> 00:16:30,024
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm using my DS as my GBA as well.

240
00:16:30,584 --> 00:16:41,793
[SPEAKER_02]: Our buddies over in Europe, there's a story being announced there that the DS in Europe has sold 1 million units and that's since the portable launch there three months ago.

241
00:16:42,153 --> 00:16:45,076
[SPEAKER_02]: Worldwide DS sales now at 6 million.

242
00:16:45,116 --> 00:16:46,797
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's taken off in Europe.

243
00:16:47,742 --> 00:16:54,686
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know the PSP, they're cracking down on the importing of the PSPs before it's actually released out there and all this interesting stuff.

244
00:16:54,726 --> 00:16:56,927
[SPEAKER_03]: Which should actually be coming up in the next Mother Show.

245
00:16:57,268 --> 00:16:57,988
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, very soon.

246
00:16:58,068 --> 00:16:59,709
[SPEAKER_02]: So you guys don't have to wait much longer for that.

247
00:17:01,497 --> 00:17:05,799
[SPEAKER_02]: There was actually a lot of news this week about MTV, which I think is very interesting.

248
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:12,502
[SPEAKER_02]: MTV has formed their own MTV Games unit.

249
00:17:13,122 --> 00:17:22,846
[SPEAKER_02]: MTV Games is devoted to, quote, "...developing, producing, and promoting unique and creative gaming experiences that resonate with MTV's audience."

250
00:17:23,246 --> 00:17:31,793
[SPEAKER_02]: And this kind of falls in line with another article that's been floating around in the music game community saying that MTV is talking, they want to get into the music games.

251
00:17:32,654 --> 00:17:37,317
[SPEAKER_02]: But I can't help but think, haven't MTV put out games already to some extent?

252
00:17:37,357 --> 00:17:38,558
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I remember there was a remote control.

253
00:17:38,578 --> 00:17:39,479
[SPEAKER_03]: The music generator games.

254
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:43,042
[SPEAKER_02]: The music generator games, the remote control games on Nintendo.

255
00:17:43,914 --> 00:17:50,737
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm thinking, okay, the difference is that those were games put out by other companies using the MTV license.

256
00:17:51,357 --> 00:17:53,898
[SPEAKER_02]: Now MTV wants to do their own thing.

257
00:17:54,578 --> 00:17:55,819
[SPEAKER_02]: So what do you think?

258
00:17:56,059 --> 00:17:59,140
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it going to be commercially successful?

259
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:02,622
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, let's face it, MTV, huge marketing machine, they get free advertising.

260
00:18:02,902 --> 00:18:03,282
[SPEAKER_02]: Crap.

261
00:18:05,036 --> 00:18:32,088
[SPEAKER_01]: are you saying that just because you're getting older and jaded with MTV or do you truly believe there's something else here there's gonna be stupid children that's gonna buy it though MTV does not know how to market games honestly I mean they hello look at it's MTV a channel itself it's supposed to be music music on their channel it's all just stupid reality TV shows I mean hello road rules the game honestly folks um

262
00:18:33,228 --> 00:18:39,235
[SPEAKER_01]: They might be able to market it as a game, but I think it's gonna fail overall.

263
00:18:39,736 --> 00:18:40,937
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the way I think it is.

264
00:18:51,488 --> 00:18:55,751
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to jointly... Basically what's going to happen, it's like a partnership for marketing.

265
00:18:56,011 --> 00:19:01,255
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to jointly sell in-game advertising and collaborating on the soundtracks and things like that.

266
00:19:01,615 --> 00:19:03,757
[SPEAKER_02]: Now get this, Midway has LA Rush, right?

267
00:19:04,097 --> 00:19:11,442
[SPEAKER_02]: What they're going to do is they're going to take some branding from Pimp My Ride on MTV and incorporate that into LA Rush.

268
00:19:11,662 --> 00:19:12,363
[SPEAKER_01]: Good for them.

269
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:16,446
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, as long as they get their game out there, I mean, whatever way they...

270
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:17,847
[SPEAKER_01]: Managers do that.

271
00:19:17,967 --> 00:19:18,947
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good for them.

272
00:19:19,047 --> 00:19:22,529
[SPEAKER_02]: Works out for Midway because they get free marketing, basically.

273
00:19:22,549 --> 00:19:23,330
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly.

274
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:26,431
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that disgrace the L.A.

275
00:19:26,892 --> 00:19:28,092
[SPEAKER_01]: Rush franchise?

276
00:19:28,192 --> 00:19:29,653
[SPEAKER_01]: No, honestly, L.A.

277
00:19:29,713 --> 00:19:32,095
[SPEAKER_01]: Rush wasn't that good of a game to begin with.

278
00:19:32,915 --> 00:19:37,658
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd rather see them pushing the Pimp My Ride aspect of that.

279
00:19:38,298 --> 00:19:41,480
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, it's really sad that that game really sucked.

280
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:45,022
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the problem is, is that... I don't mind L.A.

281
00:19:45,042 --> 00:19:45,762
[SPEAKER_02]: Rush, it's alright.

282
00:19:45,942 --> 00:19:46,603
[SPEAKER_02]: It was okay!

283
00:19:46,623 --> 00:19:48,744
[SPEAKER_02]: I enjoyed, like, Hydro Thunder and Arctic Thunder.

284
00:19:48,824 --> 00:19:49,684
[SPEAKER_01]: It was okay!

285
00:19:49,785 --> 00:19:53,206
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem was, it lost all the aspects of the Rush series.

286
00:19:53,567 --> 00:20:06,254
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the Rush series is basically like, okay, you have, like, you know, a set track that you go to, there's a few shortcuts and whatnot, and there's some really cool, you know, shortcuts you can take that, you know, involve, like, a lot of big jumps and whatnot.

287
00:20:06,274 --> 00:20:06,354
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

288
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:09,493
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, any thoughts on this?

289
00:20:26,816 --> 00:20:28,418
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

290
00:20:45,879 --> 00:21:14,794
[SPEAKER_02]: either that or we would let our 4 year old babies die so in order to help better your life we're here to offer you some advice to help better your life in many ways and who better to bring that advice to you than DarkSakura with her advice column today's bit of advice is how to survive a fall onto subway tracks number one do not attempt to climb back onto the platform unless you are positive you have enough time to do so

291
00:21:16,031 --> 00:21:19,714
[SPEAKER_03]: 2.

292
00:21:16,652 --> 00:21:19,714
[SPEAKER_03]: Find a safe place to stand out of the way of the oncoming train.

293
00:21:22,235 --> 00:21:19,714
3.

294
00:21:22,315 --> 00:21:28,079
[SPEAKER_03]: Stand against a wall between columns separating two tracks on an adjoining set of tracks or beneath the platform.

295
00:21:29,251 --> 00:21:35,596
[SPEAKER_03]: 4.

296
00:21:29,672 --> 00:21:35,596
[SPEAKER_03]: Remove any articles of clothing or bags that could catch on the train and stand still, straight, and tall.

297
00:21:35,656 --> 00:21:36,177
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, I don't get that.

298
00:21:36,197 --> 00:21:37,838
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not supposed to jump on the platform?

299
00:21:37,858 --> 00:21:38,198
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you do?

300
00:21:38,218 --> 00:21:41,321
[SPEAKER_02]: You jump on the other tracks where the train isn't coming and hope you're right?

301
00:21:41,621 --> 00:21:46,905
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a middle section that has the pillars that hold the area up between where the alternating tracks are.

302
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:48,686
[SPEAKER_02]: Not every subway system.

303
00:21:48,746 --> 00:21:50,987
[SPEAKER_03]: Not every, but there are many that do.

304
00:21:51,007 --> 00:21:52,267
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I'm thinking about Bart.

305
00:21:52,407 --> 00:21:57,310
[SPEAKER_02]: Bart doesn't have, okay, the picture you have shows, okay, I understand that, but like Bart doesn't have that.

306
00:21:57,390 --> 00:22:00,731
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I fall on the tracks on Bart, I'm dead, basically, is what you're saying.

307
00:22:00,751 --> 00:22:00,911
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

308
00:22:01,252 --> 00:22:01,492
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

309
00:22:01,712 --> 00:22:02,952
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless you can get your ass up.

310
00:22:03,152 --> 00:22:03,613
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, I'm sorry.

311
00:22:03,633 --> 00:22:05,253
[SPEAKER_03]: But my final piece of advice.

312
00:22:05,273 --> 00:22:05,514
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

313
00:22:06,514 --> 00:22:08,375
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't fucking ride the subway to hit a taxi.

314
00:22:14,438 --> 00:22:17,400
[SPEAKER_02]: Our New York friends can benefit from this piece of advice.

315
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:18,061
[SPEAKER_02]: How about this?

316
00:22:18,781 --> 00:22:21,604
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't cross the yellow line, kids.

317
00:22:22,004 --> 00:22:24,987
[SPEAKER_03]: Each knee, each knee, Suicide Club, yo.

318
00:22:26,008 --> 00:22:27,750
[SPEAKER_02]: If you got that reference, hats off to you.

319
00:22:30,472 --> 00:22:31,633
[SPEAKER_02]: Big news this week.

320
00:22:31,673 --> 00:22:32,053
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't...

321
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:02,017
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure a lot of you guys have heard a lot about this story.

322
00:23:02,418 --> 00:23:03,659
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm curious what you guys think.

323
00:23:03,859 --> 00:23:07,003
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, what do you think about this, this peer-to-peer ruling?

324
00:23:07,243 --> 00:23:10,827
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think this is fair, that Grokester should be held responsible for what its users do with it?

325
00:23:13,385 --> 00:23:42,920
[SPEAKER_03]: ultimately they are providing the means so legally the service that provides the means for the illegal activity has a right of responsibility they would basically be found negligent for allowing the misuse of their material however there is not a way to regulate this which again in the eyes of the court would be you shouldn't offer this service don't operate your business

326
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:47,292
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, that takes money out of their pocket.

327
00:23:48,012 --> 00:23:53,555
[SPEAKER_03]: Which, taking money out of the pocket of a small business eventually will hurt the economy.

328
00:23:54,315 --> 00:23:58,377
[SPEAKER_03]: Therefore, they're basically treading on some thin ice right here, the courts and the company.

329
00:23:59,138 --> 00:24:09,003
[SPEAKER_03]: So the court's probably looking at this as a way to hold them responsible as a party while maintaining balance in industry.

330
00:24:10,263 --> 00:24:11,584
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if that makes sense to you.

331
00:24:12,566 --> 00:24:13,727
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, okay, I'll follow you.

332
00:24:13,987 --> 00:24:17,150
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, I'm coming from having taken that business law class.

333
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:18,171
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, all right.

334
00:24:18,952 --> 00:24:20,093
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, moving on.

335
00:24:20,533 --> 00:24:21,974
[SPEAKER_02]: My thoughts on this whole thing.

336
00:24:22,094 --> 00:24:26,058
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it really depends on how you're marketing your peer-to-peer network.

337
00:24:26,598 --> 00:24:29,401
[SPEAKER_02]: I think if you're marketing your peer-to-peer network as...

338
00:24:30,542 --> 00:24:34,525
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, come to our network and trade your illegal MP3 files on our network.

339
00:24:34,826 --> 00:24:37,428
[SPEAKER_02]: Then yes, I think you can be held responsible.

340
00:24:37,808 --> 00:24:53,523
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think if you're marketing your network as something that should be used for legit purposes, the trading of open source programs or what have you, and this is what you're encouraging your users to do and you're discouraging your users via marketing,

341
00:24:53,823 --> 00:24:57,644
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I have a case that I can repeat, and I'll go home my case.

342
00:24:57,684 --> 00:24:58,204
[SPEAKER_02]: The weed eater.

343
00:25:21,931 --> 00:25:34,477
[SPEAKER_03]: has a warning on it that says, do not allow people under the age of, I believe that it was 15 years old, within 20 feet of this machine while being operated.

344
00:25:36,298 --> 00:25:38,619
[SPEAKER_03]: In this case, an uncle was weed eating the lawn.

345
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,921
[SPEAKER_03]: The thing was fully on the machine.

346
00:25:42,961 --> 00:25:44,822
[SPEAKER_03]: 10 year old kids picking up dirt after it.

347
00:25:45,602 --> 00:25:48,663
[SPEAKER_03]: The uncle, the mom's like off doing something else.

348
00:25:48,703 --> 00:25:50,684
[SPEAKER_03]: She's there but not observing her child.

349
00:25:51,705 --> 00:25:53,545
[SPEAKER_03]: The guy hits a rock with the weed eater.

350
00:25:54,145 --> 00:25:55,626
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is the one with the metal blades.

351
00:25:56,606 --> 00:25:57,387
[SPEAKER_03]: It recoils.

352
00:25:58,227 --> 00:26:00,748
[SPEAKER_03]: Goes backwards and slices off the child's arm at the elbow.

353
00:26:02,349 --> 00:26:06,370
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, we are looking at this as logical adults.

354
00:26:07,751 --> 00:26:08,771
[SPEAKER_03]: Who do you think would be at fault?

355
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:16,003
[SPEAKER_03]: As a logical adult, would it be the uncle for his negligence?

356
00:26:16,583 --> 00:26:17,684
[SPEAKER_03]: Or would it be the weed eater company?

357
00:26:18,624 --> 00:26:22,006
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it would be the child because they're dumb enough to walk next to him.

358
00:26:22,026 --> 00:26:22,947
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, using common sense.

359
00:26:23,007 --> 00:26:26,589
[SPEAKER_02]: It falls in one of those categories of accidents happen.

360
00:26:26,609 --> 00:26:28,590
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a car, accidents happen.

361
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:30,711
[SPEAKER_02]: It's unfortunate, but it was an accident.

362
00:26:30,771 --> 00:26:32,172
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think anybody's liable in that case.

363
00:26:32,712 --> 00:26:33,873
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my opinion is logical.

364
00:26:34,221 --> 00:26:38,824
[SPEAKER_03]: In the state of Oklahoma, there are three cases for a company to be held liable for negligence.

365
00:26:39,525 --> 00:26:45,289
[SPEAKER_03]: That's for default of the machine, accident caused by said default, to misuse of the item.

366
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:51,293
[SPEAKER_03]: The company was actually found at fault for a default that the machine did not have.

367
00:26:51,874 --> 00:26:58,619
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, taking that example, that poison notice on the bottle of bleach isn't going to mean shit.

368
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:05,342
[SPEAKER_03]: unless it is proven that the child swallowed the item while the parent was negligent.

369
00:27:05,722 --> 00:27:07,023
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it is the parent's fault.

370
00:27:07,403 --> 00:27:13,925
[SPEAKER_02]: However, again... Well, okay, tying this back to the peer-to-peer network thing before we lose too many people in our analogies.

371
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:16,326
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, but I'm using it as... No, I understand, I understand.

372
00:27:16,746 --> 00:27:18,027
[SPEAKER_02]: But no...

373
00:27:18,857 --> 00:27:27,665
[SPEAKER_02]: The MPAA or the RIAA is not going to... Well, I guess they have been suing the individual users to some extent, but having very limited success in doing so.

374
00:27:27,745 --> 00:27:30,447
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's bad, bad PR for them, too.

375
00:27:31,168 --> 00:27:33,149
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

376
00:27:33,229 --> 00:27:35,311
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, the way that this ties into the peer-to-peer.

377
00:27:36,532 --> 00:27:37,773
[SPEAKER_03]: Peer-to-peer office of service.

378
00:27:38,474 --> 00:27:43,258
[SPEAKER_03]: They do have the disclaimers on there that this is not to be used for X purposes, right?

379
00:27:43,278 --> 00:27:43,358
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

380
00:27:44,154 --> 00:27:48,546
[SPEAKER_03]: some of them it depends on the network even those that have that notice on there

381
00:27:49,469 --> 00:27:55,813
[SPEAKER_03]: If their product is being, quote, misused, they're still responsible.

382
00:27:56,193 --> 00:27:56,653
[SPEAKER_03]: That's interesting.

383
00:27:56,693 --> 00:27:59,555
[SPEAKER_03]: In the eyes of the court, they should still be responsible.

384
00:27:59,635 --> 00:28:03,257
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, again, logically, that doesn't make sense.

385
00:28:03,657 --> 00:28:10,061
[SPEAKER_03]: Logically, it should be in the hands of the person who is misusing the product as long as the disclaimer exists.

386
00:28:10,541 --> 00:28:16,905
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, another thing, too, is that when they download that service, there's usually, and I've studied this, there is a click agreement.

387
00:28:17,512 --> 00:28:20,580
[SPEAKER_03]: by clicking that little box that says you agree to their terms of service

388
00:28:21,582 --> 00:28:26,363
[SPEAKER_03]: You are signing a contract that says, I will not misuse this item.

389
00:28:26,783 --> 00:28:29,944
[SPEAKER_03]: I will not do this for anything other than a specific purpose intended.

390
00:28:30,284 --> 00:28:33,485
[SPEAKER_02]: So even after all that, the companies could still be held liable?

391
00:28:33,885 --> 00:28:50,089
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't, if they are in the case that they have that as a full part of their agreement, and the parties violating that terms of service have clicked that agreement, they're using their product, and that clause exists,

392
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,369
[SPEAKER_03]: I do not believe the company should be held liable.

393
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:53,390
[SPEAKER_03]: They put it in there.

394
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:57,071
[SPEAKER_03]: It is the point of the user at that point.

395
00:28:57,671 --> 00:29:02,892
[SPEAKER_03]: Violating terms of service which removes negligence from the company.

396
00:29:03,012 --> 00:29:03,732
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the reality.

397
00:29:03,772 --> 00:29:04,673
[SPEAKER_02]: How many people read that?

398
00:29:05,133 --> 00:29:05,973
[SPEAKER_02]: No one does.

399
00:29:06,893 --> 00:29:09,654
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, maybe 5% of the users of it.

400
00:29:10,254 --> 00:29:13,715
[SPEAKER_03]: Still, how many people buy a house and don't read their mortgage?

401
00:29:13,875 --> 00:29:14,075
[SPEAKER_03]: True.

402
00:29:15,471 --> 00:29:16,672
[SPEAKER_03]: I work at a mortgage company.

403
00:29:17,032 --> 00:29:19,815
[SPEAKER_03]: How many freaking calls did I get when I was in customer service?

404
00:29:20,335 --> 00:29:22,917
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do I have a prepayment penalty?

405
00:29:23,137 --> 00:29:24,878
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, didn't you read your contract?

406
00:29:24,918 --> 00:29:27,680
[SPEAKER_03]: You had three days to change your fucking mind.

407
00:29:28,841 --> 00:29:30,903
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, pardon me for my rudeness on that.

408
00:29:31,523 --> 00:29:34,645
[SPEAKER_03]: But people need to freaking read.

409
00:29:35,506 --> 00:29:37,447
[SPEAKER_03]: You sign a contract, you need to read it.

410
00:29:37,528 --> 00:29:40,370
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that in the case of this peer-to-peer networks...

411
00:29:41,221 --> 00:29:43,604
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that they shouldn't be held at fault at all.

412
00:29:43,664 --> 00:29:47,428
[SPEAKER_03]: However, those who are too stupid to put that clause in there, oh yeah, nail them.

413
00:29:48,108 --> 00:29:48,569
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously.

414
00:29:48,829 --> 00:29:51,452
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, many different perspectives on this issue.

415
00:29:51,472 --> 00:29:52,753
[SPEAKER_02]: A very hot button issue in the community.

416
00:29:52,793 --> 00:29:54,555
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have thoughts, we'd love to hear them.

417
00:29:54,675 --> 00:29:56,837
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sorry for going off on the legal aspect of it.

418
00:29:56,877 --> 00:29:59,400
[SPEAKER_03]: That's something that really I research.

419
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:02,343
[SPEAKER_02]: We want people to think about the different perspectives of looking at it.

420
00:30:02,703 --> 00:30:06,125
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people are just stomping their foot going, that's not fair.

421
00:30:06,205 --> 00:30:08,306
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to keep downloading music for free.

422
00:30:08,366 --> 00:30:09,286
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not fair.

423
00:30:09,947 --> 00:30:16,790
[SPEAKER_03]: In the case of this, you have to really look at the big picture to understand what's going on.

424
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:19,131
[SPEAKER_03]: The average gamer, I don't think is going to do that.

425
00:30:19,371 --> 00:30:22,233
[SPEAKER_03]: The average gamer is probably going to be teenage, lower 20s.

426
00:30:22,573 --> 00:30:24,274
[SPEAKER_03]: The average gamer.

427
00:30:28,102 --> 00:30:29,504
[SPEAKER_02]: To hugely generalize, yes.

428
00:30:29,844 --> 00:30:34,448
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're not going to be in the age group that is known for thinking about this type of thing.

429
00:30:35,309 --> 00:30:46,279
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, but if you're going to have an opinion, it's a good idea to have an informed opinion as opposed to stomping your foot and acting like an ignorant little child.

430
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,481
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry is the truth.

431
00:30:49,402 --> 00:30:51,964
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're here to help educate you and think about this.

432
00:30:51,984 --> 00:30:53,005
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly, exactly.

433
00:30:53,045 --> 00:30:53,286
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

434
00:30:54,028 --> 00:30:54,608
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move on.

435
00:30:54,649 --> 00:30:55,849
[SPEAKER_02]: We lost Loki.

436
00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:56,810
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's all right.

437
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:58,271
[SPEAKER_02]: Did Loki pass out finally?

438
00:30:58,291 --> 00:30:58,692
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

439
00:30:58,712 --> 00:30:59,512
[SPEAKER_02]: He's still with us, Loki?

440
00:30:59,913 --> 00:31:00,173
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

441
00:31:00,553 --> 00:31:01,694
[SPEAKER_02]: He's still there a little bit.

442
00:31:02,294 --> 00:31:02,555
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

443
00:31:02,775 --> 00:31:04,456
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, do you have a thought on the peer-to-peer thing?

444
00:31:04,536 --> 00:31:05,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you get your microphone back up there?

445
00:31:06,157 --> 00:31:07,278
[SPEAKER_02]: We dropped it earlier.

446
00:31:07,298 --> 00:31:08,759
[SPEAKER_03]: The opinion of the average drunk.

447
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,241
[SPEAKER_02]: What are we talking about now?

448
00:31:10,881 --> 00:31:11,542
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

449
00:31:12,422 --> 00:31:15,845
[SPEAKER_02]: Peer-to-peer networks said you can be held liable.

450
00:31:16,145 --> 00:31:19,688
[SPEAKER_02]: The Supreme Court says you, grokester, can be held liable because people misuse your service.

451
00:31:19,708 --> 00:31:20,709
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never heard of grokester.

452
00:31:21,189 --> 00:31:29,936
[SPEAKER_01]: My thought is, you know what, honestly, those peer-to-peer networks, they know that there's legal files being shared on there.

453
00:31:30,756 --> 00:31:37,061
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just doing the best they can to, you know, cover their asses, so... Honestly, um...

454
00:31:38,442 --> 00:31:42,486
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need to go through Grokester to find all the files that you're looking for.

455
00:31:42,506 --> 00:31:44,889
[SPEAKER_01]: The hell with Grokester.

456
00:31:44,909 --> 00:31:46,610
[SPEAKER_02]: You are bringing up this point that a lot of people say.

457
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:49,473
[SPEAKER_02]: When you squelch one problem, it just gets bigger.

458
00:31:49,493 --> 00:31:51,936
[SPEAKER_02]: For instance, if they had never shut down Napster...

459
00:31:52,888 --> 00:31:54,709
[SPEAKER_02]: iTunes probably would be a lot more successful.

460
00:31:54,729 --> 00:32:00,972
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though iTunes is having a lot of success now, iTunes would probably be more successful if it had showed up before they shut down Napster.

461
00:32:01,012 --> 00:32:03,533
[SPEAKER_02]: Because people would have went from Napster to iTunes.

462
00:32:03,593 --> 00:32:06,955
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead, people went from Napster to... Well, actually, and I take that back.

463
00:32:07,375 --> 00:32:10,336
[SPEAKER_02]: iTunes did exist in some form on the Mac only, though.

464
00:32:10,636 --> 00:32:14,218
[SPEAKER_02]: But Mac only has a smaller share than the PC.

465
00:32:14,418 --> 00:32:17,200
[SPEAKER_03]: I went from Napster to... What was that?

466
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:17,700
[SPEAKER_03]: Music...

467
00:32:19,091 --> 00:32:41,529
[SPEAKER_03]: Audio Galaxy Some people went to LimeWire, Nutella, there was a lot From that I went to Kazaa and now I'm on BitTorrent And the problem is getting worse and worse And I, by the way, am downloading files illegally And if you come try to search through my computer, oh government I'm going to fucking nail your ass to the goddamn wall and get you to fucking pay me

468
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:50,258
[SPEAKER_03]: for violation of privacy and violating my rights under the Constitution.

469
00:32:50,618 --> 00:32:53,060
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, I'm going to nail you if you pull that shit on me.

470
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,002
[SPEAKER_02]: You do know anyone can listen to this podcast, right?

471
00:32:55,262 --> 00:32:55,723
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I don't care.

472
00:32:55,923 --> 00:32:57,424
[SPEAKER_02]: They do it.

473
00:32:57,905 --> 00:33:01,368
[SPEAKER_03]: We are on unregulated freaking radio.

474
00:33:01,708 --> 00:33:02,389
[SPEAKER_03]: I will nail you.

475
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:04,071
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

476
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:05,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Them's fighting words.

477
00:33:06,253 --> 00:33:06,693
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care.

478
00:33:09,915 --> 00:33:11,756
[SPEAKER_02]: The BBC is running a story.

479
00:33:11,796 --> 00:33:14,417
[SPEAKER_02]: This story actually being linked from Slash.

480
00:33:14,457 --> 00:33:15,157
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this is interesting.

481
00:33:15,717 --> 00:33:21,179
[SPEAKER_02]: BBC is running a story saying that women are going to explode onto the gaming scene any minute now.

482
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:27,221
[SPEAKER_03]: I just exploded on the gaming scene.

483
00:33:28,536 --> 00:33:30,397
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, I'm not really downloading illegal files.

484
00:33:30,557 --> 00:33:33,978
[SPEAKER_02]: You can pretty much figure where the rest of this story is going.

485
00:33:34,038 --> 00:33:40,101
[SPEAKER_02]: Saying that online role-playing games are doing good with women, despite the subject matter, da-da-da.

486
00:33:41,541 --> 00:33:44,963
[SPEAKER_02]: Women gamers in the UK make up a quarter of the gaming population.

487
00:33:44,983 --> 00:33:46,583
[SPEAKER_02]: 39% in the US, 69% in South Korea.

488
00:33:50,771 --> 00:33:56,193
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

489
00:34:11,704 --> 00:34:14,166
[SPEAKER_03]: I enjoy my Phantasy Star Online.

490
00:34:15,066 --> 00:34:16,247
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been a week without it.

491
00:34:17,828 --> 00:34:19,029
[SPEAKER_03]: But it doesn't matter.

492
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:24,653
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is there a stupid report about this freaking bullcrap?

493
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:28,796
[SPEAKER_02]: Because a lot of horny guys out there want to be gay or women.

494
00:34:28,836 --> 00:34:31,278
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you're like, oh my god, girls play video games!

495
00:34:31,458 --> 00:34:33,920
[SPEAKER_03]: What is the freaking 21st century?

496
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,501
[SPEAKER_03]: Get with the times!

497
00:34:35,561 --> 00:34:36,722
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't need a study!

498
00:34:37,042 --> 00:34:38,383
[SPEAKER_02]: There were girls that played Atari.

499
00:34:39,164 --> 00:34:39,484
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.

500
00:34:40,024 --> 00:34:41,484
[SPEAKER_03]: I played Atari, hello.

501
00:34:41,504 --> 00:34:44,845
[SPEAKER_02]: But admittedly, not as many women play games as guys.

502
00:34:45,145 --> 00:34:48,426
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that needs to freaking change, but you don't need a report to tell you this.

503
00:34:49,586 --> 00:34:50,486
[SPEAKER_02]: So what do they need to do?

504
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:51,346
[SPEAKER_02]: Really quickly, what do they need to do?

505
00:34:51,366 --> 00:34:54,947
[SPEAKER_03]: They need to turn off their Xbox and go out and meet people.

506
00:34:55,687 --> 00:34:56,447
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, I'm not talking about that.

507
00:34:56,467 --> 00:34:56,787
[SPEAKER_02]: Get laid.

508
00:34:56,827 --> 00:34:58,028
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you get more women in games?

509
00:35:00,108 --> 00:35:01,428
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it the type of games they're putting out?

510
00:35:01,468 --> 00:35:02,609
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it the way they market them?

511
00:35:03,009 --> 00:35:04,749
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it just society stigma?

512
00:35:05,538 --> 00:35:08,619
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the average woman interest is ridiculous.

513
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:10,479
[SPEAKER_03]: They need like Cosmo the game.

514
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,540
[SPEAKER_02]: So Paris Hilton needs to put out a video game.

515
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:14,500
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess.

516
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:16,241
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, how to be a social whore.

517
00:35:17,181 --> 00:35:20,181
[SPEAKER_02]: But the rest, no gamer would ever take a game like that seriously.

518
00:35:20,221 --> 00:35:25,083
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like Mary Kay and Ashley learn to drive or whatever, Sweet 16 are the laughing stock of the gaming world.

519
00:35:25,383 --> 00:35:25,603
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

520
00:35:26,303 --> 00:35:30,784
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the thing is, is that I play freaking Ragnarok and Ragnarok's cutesy.

521
00:35:31,697 --> 00:35:36,458
[SPEAKER_03]: I played Final Fantasy XI, I played Phantasy Star Online.

522
00:35:37,158 --> 00:35:40,919
[SPEAKER_03]: I played Halo until I found out it made me motion sick.

523
00:35:40,959 --> 00:35:49,361
[SPEAKER_03]: My favorite game of all time is freaking Guardian Legend, which is one of the single hardest video games ever.

524
00:35:49,962 --> 00:35:55,463
[SPEAKER_03]: I played Abadox, which was supposed to be the most gory video game when it came out.

525
00:35:55,503 --> 00:35:56,423
[SPEAKER_03]: You're just special, though.

526
00:35:56,603 --> 00:35:57,523
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it boils down to.

527
00:35:57,804 --> 00:35:59,504
[SPEAKER_03]: I am a true gamer woman.

528
00:36:01,216 --> 00:36:05,267
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel sorry though for other women to have me as the voice of the gaming community.

529
00:36:07,029 --> 00:36:08,690
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the violent stuff.

530
00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:10,950
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's the game?

531
00:36:11,290 --> 00:36:12,751
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple more stories here, you guys.

532
00:36:13,031 --> 00:36:16,232
[SPEAKER_02]: PlayStation 3 will not be coming out with a hard drive.

533
00:36:16,372 --> 00:36:19,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Xbox 360, they are saying they're going to do a 20 gig hard drive.

534
00:36:19,613 --> 00:36:22,174
[SPEAKER_02]: PlayStation 3, nope, not coming with it.

535
00:36:22,254 --> 00:36:27,775
[SPEAKER_02]: There will be a slot where you can put in an 80 gig hard drive a little later on, but no hard drive in the outset.

536
00:36:28,415 --> 00:36:33,557
[SPEAKER_02]: To me, this is kind of striking me as these stories are really kind of a bigger deal than I think they ought to be.

537
00:36:34,652 --> 00:36:54,814
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it just really depends on the games that are coming out if the games come out and they don't require a hard drive because none of the games they have out right now really require a hard drive console wise save maybe Final Fantasy 11 a couple other exceptions that's all you need that's all the gaming system needs to be successful are good games right

538
00:36:56,039 --> 00:36:57,380
[SPEAKER_03]: And I only use it for that.

539
00:37:22,734 --> 00:37:23,174
[SPEAKER_03]: Koji Sugitani

540
00:37:42,837 --> 00:37:49,479
[SPEAKER_02]: He is a video game voice actor, and he contributed to Xenosaga, and he said in his blog, I'm doing another one.

541
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:53,541
[SPEAKER_02]: So he kind of let the cat out of the bag that there is a Xenosaga 3 on the way.

542
00:37:53,761 --> 00:37:55,201
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we kind of figured that.

543
00:37:55,241 --> 00:37:56,762
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think we kind of figured that.

544
00:37:56,822 --> 00:38:05,805
[SPEAKER_02]: Namco, by the way, not making any official statement on that, but in the blog it says he has begun recording work for the next installment in the series.

545
00:38:06,165 --> 00:38:10,987
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of not a big surprise, but I'm sure a lot of fans will be happy to know that yes, it is indeed happening.

546
00:38:12,262 --> 00:38:17,803
[SPEAKER_02]: And lastly tonight, a story about a gaming company called Left Behind Games.

547
00:38:18,484 --> 00:38:20,264
[SPEAKER_02]: You might know the term Left Behind.

548
00:38:20,304 --> 00:38:26,325
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a famous book series that's big in the Christian and religious world.

549
00:38:26,706 --> 00:38:32,327
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about what happened after the rapture, basically, and those folks that were left behind after the rapture.

550
00:38:32,567 --> 00:38:33,687
[SPEAKER_03]: Burn and inhale!

551
00:38:34,507 --> 00:38:35,568
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, get this.

552
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:40,989
[SPEAKER_02]: They are making a PC game based on those novels.

553
00:38:42,984 --> 00:38:43,725
[SPEAKER_02]: Not surprising.

554
00:38:44,045 --> 00:38:45,466
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how that's going to work.

555
00:38:46,186 --> 00:38:56,814
[SPEAKER_02]: But it seems like now a lot of sites out there and blogs are saying that, hmm, between this and you saw at E3, Natsumi had made the Bible game, which was like Jeopardy for Bibles.

556
00:38:57,275 --> 00:39:00,237
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like Christian gaming is making this big comeback.

557
00:39:00,277 --> 00:39:02,279
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what, didn't we already have Black Matrix?

558
00:39:03,319 --> 00:39:05,301
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish that Black Matrix would come out in the States.

559
00:39:05,701 --> 00:39:09,744
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, I mean, go ahead and make a Bible game.

560
00:39:09,964 --> 00:39:10,765
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, why not?

561
00:39:11,371 --> 00:39:19,013
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, people are going to play it, and you've got the small following that follows the whole Left Behind series and whatnot.

562
00:39:20,413 --> 00:39:20,813
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead.

563
00:39:20,853 --> 00:39:24,694
[SPEAKER_01]: If you think you're going to make some money off of it, more power to you.

564
00:39:24,774 --> 00:39:28,595
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it fails, well, we just told you so.

565
00:39:29,336 --> 00:39:31,656
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's my last question to you guys, and then we'll wrap up the show.

566
00:39:31,836 --> 00:39:38,978
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this a good thing or a bad thing for gaming, or does it strictly depend on how the game is?

567
00:39:40,801 --> 00:39:46,005
[SPEAKER_01]: I think honestly it's not going to be good or bad for gaming.

568
00:39:46,265 --> 00:39:50,548
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically whether people are going to buy into it or not.

569
00:39:51,609 --> 00:39:55,192
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a matter of whether this is going to be good or bad for gaming.

570
00:39:55,832 --> 00:40:00,095
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just how many people are going to be behind this type of game.

571
00:40:02,537 --> 00:40:08,942
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just really depending on how much of a following you have for this type of thing.

572
00:40:09,873 --> 00:40:14,397
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, other than that, you know, that's the only thing that's going to be depending on how good it's going to be.

573
00:40:14,637 --> 00:40:18,160
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, because if you have a good following behind it, it's going to be good.

574
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,781
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, it's going to suck.

575
00:40:20,582 --> 00:40:20,902
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

576
00:40:20,962 --> 00:40:28,888
[SPEAKER_02]: I say it's a good thing for gaming because it'll take people's attention, certain people who need their attention taken away from games like Grand Theft Auto.

577
00:40:29,008 --> 00:40:32,852
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there's people out there, they seriously are in this mindset that all video games are violent.

578
00:40:33,312 --> 00:40:34,273
[SPEAKER_02]: All video games are violent.

579
00:40:34,333 --> 00:40:34,653
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.

580
00:40:35,113 --> 00:40:38,136
[SPEAKER_02]: Video games, movies, art in any form.

581
00:40:38,156 --> 00:40:38,436
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.

582
00:40:41,097 --> 00:40:43,718
[SPEAKER_02]: Art in any form is what you want it to be.

583
00:40:44,558 --> 00:40:52,400
[SPEAKER_02]: And if this can show people, certain people that need to see this, and I'm not saying that every Christian needs to see this.

584
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:54,081
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not what I'm saying.

585
00:40:54,101 --> 00:41:02,063
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm saying certain hardcore people that are out there that are saying video games are just, they're all violent and they're all plaguing society.

586
00:41:02,443 --> 00:41:07,505
[SPEAKER_02]: If this will help people see that not all video games have to be violent, then I say it's a good thing.

587
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:12,005
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, this is what I say being an artist myself.

588
00:41:13,526 --> 00:41:19,108
[SPEAKER_03]: The goal of an artist, in the end, is to provoke a reaction.

589
00:41:20,129 --> 00:41:27,212
[SPEAKER_03]: Whether you are offended by it, whether you don't like it, whether you love it, have a positive reaction.

590
00:41:28,718 --> 00:41:43,211
[SPEAKER_03]: Getting that reaction, getting feedback on that reaction, that is a goal of an artist because they know that their work, be it a video game, be it a piece of visual art or written, they know that their piece created that response.

591
00:41:44,032 --> 00:41:46,674
[SPEAKER_03]: Apathy is the worst thing an artist can have.

592
00:41:47,134 --> 00:41:50,217
[SPEAKER_02]: So then are we in agreement that video game creators are in fact artists?

593
00:41:50,678 --> 00:41:51,138
[SPEAKER_03]: I do agree.

594
00:41:51,999 --> 00:41:52,279
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki?

595
00:41:52,619 --> 00:41:55,622
[SPEAKER_01]: To a certain extent, I would assume, but you know.

596
00:41:56,829 --> 00:42:01,672
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, let's not go crazy and assume that they're artists just because they create a video game.

597
00:42:02,013 --> 00:42:04,514
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's art just in another form.

598
00:42:05,315 --> 00:42:05,975
[SPEAKER_01]: In a sense.

599
00:42:06,035 --> 00:42:10,258
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, let's not go crazy with saying that... You have writing involved.

600
00:42:10,978 --> 00:42:11,919
[SPEAKER_03]: You have art involved.

601
00:42:11,979 --> 00:42:14,021
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not the Mona Lisa, okay?

602
00:42:14,121 --> 00:42:14,401
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

603
00:42:14,921 --> 00:42:15,742
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an art form.

604
00:42:16,042 --> 00:42:18,283
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not fine art, but it's art.

605
00:42:18,443 --> 00:42:19,864
[SPEAKER_02]: Art is a way of expressing yourself, right?

606
00:42:19,964 --> 00:42:23,467
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a combination of visual art... I'd be willing to go that far.

607
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:26,249
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a combination of visual art, dramatic arts,

608
00:42:27,229 --> 00:42:31,491
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, because you've got the acting that goes into the game, the storytelling aspect of it.

609
00:42:32,152 --> 00:42:34,153
[SPEAKER_03]: And you also have the audio art.

610
00:42:35,133 --> 00:42:36,594
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you have music in the games.

611
00:42:37,154 --> 00:42:39,015
[SPEAKER_03]: It is an overall work of art.

612
00:42:40,225 --> 00:42:41,646
[SPEAKER_02]: Some very deep subjects tonight.

613
00:42:41,666 --> 00:42:42,366
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Fantasy.

614
00:42:43,206 --> 00:42:46,488
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this a post-drunk and lethargic talk or something?

615
00:42:46,548 --> 00:42:47,388
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what it is.

616
00:42:47,448 --> 00:42:52,630
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, I have no freaking clue what the hell we've been talking about.

617
00:42:52,810 --> 00:42:55,171
[SPEAKER_02]: The legal chat, I think, got my brain working.

618
00:42:55,211 --> 00:43:00,334
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were to ask me what we talked about in this podcast, I would have no clue.

619
00:43:00,394 --> 00:43:02,575
[SPEAKER_02]: You can listen to it all week long and hear what an ass you were.

620
00:43:03,675 --> 00:43:05,560
[SPEAKER_01]: Why am I wearing this shirt?

621
00:43:13,891 --> 00:43:16,111
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's wrap up the show, please.

622
00:43:16,131 --> 00:43:17,952
[SPEAKER_02]: And ribbons in both.

623
00:43:18,052 --> 00:43:20,472
[SPEAKER_02]: The video games are a good thing to end on.

624
00:43:20,572 --> 00:43:21,792
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki throwing up on himself.

625
00:43:21,912 --> 00:43:23,113
[SPEAKER_02]: Not so good a note to end on.

626
00:43:23,153 --> 00:43:23,653
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's go ahead.

627
00:43:23,913 --> 00:43:26,653
[SPEAKER_02]: Video games, art, yay, happy, shiny.

628
00:43:26,993 --> 00:43:27,313
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

629
00:43:27,613 --> 00:43:28,354
[SPEAKER_02]: Final thoughts.

630
00:43:28,414 --> 00:43:29,334
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, your final thought.

631
00:43:29,474 --> 00:43:34,315
[SPEAKER_01]: My final thought is I need to pace myself with as far as drinking goes.

632
00:43:35,015 --> 00:43:41,236
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe next time, you know, ice would be a little bit better in my drinks because, you know, the warm drinks aren't that great.

633
00:43:41,276 --> 00:43:41,456
[SPEAKER_01]: But...

634
00:43:42,697 --> 00:43:43,118
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

635
00:43:43,719 --> 00:43:47,286
[SPEAKER_01]: I was able to handle my alcohol a lot better in San Diego and I don't know why.

636
00:43:47,506 --> 00:43:52,255
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess they were just skipping on the alcohol, but I don't know.

637
00:43:52,896 --> 00:43:53,037
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

638
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:57,583
[SPEAKER_02]: My final thought is I'm very much looking forward to seeing the letter bag this week, the mail bag.

639
00:43:57,924 --> 00:43:59,645
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you guys write some good emails this week.

640
00:43:59,685 --> 00:44:00,246
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't wait to read them.

641
00:44:00,526 --> 00:44:02,528
[SPEAKER_02]: And sorry to those of you who didn't get your emails read on air.

642
00:44:02,848 --> 00:44:04,790
[SPEAKER_02]: We try to be fair and just select a couple.

643
00:44:04,830 --> 00:44:09,253
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but I reply to everybody who emails me except for the really dumb.

644
00:44:10,234 --> 00:44:12,536
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot of stuff going on in the PSP world.

645
00:44:12,616 --> 00:44:16,279
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure I didn't cover it because I don't remember covering it.

646
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:17,781
[SPEAKER_02]: Get to it next week when you're sober.

647
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:21,484
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, folks, I mean, there's a lot of cool stuff going on in the PSP world.

648
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:25,362
[SPEAKER_01]: Just, you know, check it out on PSPUpdates.com.

649
00:44:25,662 --> 00:44:26,963

[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of good stuff on there.

[SPEAKER_01]: They're actually doing 360updates.com and whatnot.

00:44:33,746 --> 00:44:37,088
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're going to find some good stuff on there, so check it out.

654
00:44:37,588 --> 00:44:39,009
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, DarkSakura, your final thought.

655
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:45,107
[SPEAKER_03]: Reject false icons and next summer I will be in London for a couple days.

656
00:44:46,008 --> 00:44:50,554
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would love to meet up with some of our UK listeners and interview a couple of them.

657
00:44:50,774 --> 00:44:53,337
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to be on the East Coast in a couple weeks, but I'll give more details on that later.

658
00:44:53,998 --> 00:44:56,441
[SPEAKER_03]: I will also be in France and I will also be in Italy.

659
00:44:57,042 --> 00:44:57,462
[SPEAKER_02]: Lucky!

660
00:44:58,484 --> 00:45:00,625
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to be chaperoning high school students.

661
00:45:01,105 --> 00:45:01,766
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sounds like fun.

662
00:45:01,806 --> 00:45:02,106
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

663
00:45:02,146 --> 00:45:02,346
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

664
00:45:02,386 --> 00:45:03,046
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's wrap it up.

665
00:45:03,346 --> 00:45:07,708
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you guys for subscribing and putting up with ourselves for another week here on the podcast.

[SPEAKER_02]: See you next time, everybody.

668
