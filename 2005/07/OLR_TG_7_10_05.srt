00:00:00,442 --> 00:00:03,483
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of July 11th, 2005.

2
00:00:03,643 --> 00:00:14,045
[SPEAKER_00]: You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.

3
00:00:14,365 --> 00:00:18,186
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.

4
00:00:19,246 --> 00:00:21,606
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, everybody, once again.

5
00:00:22,227 --> 00:00:29,208
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, that podcast dedicated to video games that don't suck.

6
00:00:30,006 --> 00:00:30,687
[SPEAKER_03]: The One and Only, Loki

7
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:01,192
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I am here and I'm sober this time.

8
00:01:01,292 --> 00:01:02,072
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, you are.

9
00:01:02,152 --> 00:01:03,733
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you feeling after last week's show?

10
00:01:03,773 --> 00:01:04,314
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel fine.

11
00:01:04,474 --> 00:01:09,577
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, after, really, you know, the next day I woke up, I did not remember the podcast.

12
00:01:09,817 --> 00:01:13,659
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember doing a podcast, but I didn't remember anything from the beginning to the end.

13
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:17,642
[SPEAKER_02]: So I actually had to listen to the podcast to figure out what I said.

14
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,981
[SPEAKER_02]: and what I said was basically a lot of rambling.

15
00:01:20,361 --> 00:01:26,123
[SPEAKER_02]: But when I wasn't repeating myself three times in a row, I was pretty... But you always ramble.

16
00:01:27,263 --> 00:01:27,784
[SPEAKER_02]: More so.

17
00:01:29,124 --> 00:01:29,804
[SPEAKER_03]: It was pretty bad.

18
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:32,045
[SPEAKER_01]: You were very random and it was hilarious.

19
00:01:32,085 --> 00:01:33,746
[SPEAKER_03]: We got some concerned emails.

20
00:01:33,786 --> 00:01:36,367
[SPEAKER_03]: I want our listeners to know he's okay.

21
00:01:36,487 --> 00:01:36,987
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm okay.

22
00:01:37,287 --> 00:01:41,649
[SPEAKER_02]: What happened was I drank a little bit more than I thought I actually had been drinking.

23
00:01:42,011 --> 00:01:43,192
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't go the whole way, like Loki did.

24
00:02:09,298 --> 00:02:10,278
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh well, lessons learned.

25
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,359
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good thing you didn't end up going to the hospital, young man.

26
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:16,540
[SPEAKER_01]: Seriously, I was thinking that you might have had, like, alcohol poisoning.

27
00:02:17,481 --> 00:02:19,601
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, he did to some extent, because that's what causes you to go bleh.

28
00:02:19,621 --> 00:02:22,943
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, but I mean... Anyway, let's move on to the games.

29
00:02:22,963 --> 00:02:23,983
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that chick on The Real World.

30
00:02:24,923 --> 00:02:26,044
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't watch crap.

31
00:02:26,204 --> 00:02:26,484
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on.

32
00:02:26,504 --> 00:02:28,885
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a long time ago, and I caught the first episode by accident.

33
00:02:29,385 --> 00:02:30,345
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought you didn't watch TV.

34
00:02:30,365 --> 00:02:31,305
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a shocker to me.

35
00:02:31,786 --> 00:02:32,986
[SPEAKER_01]: This was a long time ago.

36
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:33,686
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay, okay.

37
00:02:33,766 --> 00:02:34,787
[SPEAKER_03]: And MTV, nonetheless!

38
00:02:35,047 --> 00:02:35,387
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I know.

39
00:02:35,487 --> 00:02:35,867
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand.

40
00:02:36,445 --> 00:02:36,705
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura

41
00:02:57,702 --> 00:03:00,564
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been playing Buy the Washer and Dryer and Refrigerator game.

42
00:03:01,445 --> 00:03:04,127
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to get a Game Boy or something to play.

43
00:03:04,147 --> 00:03:06,909
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you probably have a Game Boy, a WonderSwan.

44
00:03:06,929 --> 00:03:07,829
[SPEAKER_01]: They're in boxes!

45
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:12,273
[SPEAKER_01]: But we did buy a 50-inch widescreen HDTV.

46
00:03:12,533 --> 00:03:12,913
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember.

47
00:03:12,953 --> 00:03:14,474
[SPEAKER_03]: You briefly touched on that last week.

48
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:16,295
[SPEAKER_01]: This is sexy.

49
00:03:16,516 --> 00:03:17,516
[SPEAKER_03]: How do the games look on it?

50
00:03:17,877 --> 00:03:19,298
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't hooked anything up yet.

51
00:03:19,618 --> 00:03:20,599
[SPEAKER_01]: They're in boxes!

52
00:03:20,899 --> 00:03:22,160
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are your priorities?

53
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,283
[SPEAKER_01]: My priorities have been going to work...

54
00:03:27,572 --> 00:03:30,455
[SPEAKER_01]: and buying a washer and dryer so that I don't have dirty clothes.

55
00:03:30,636 --> 00:03:31,336
[SPEAKER_03]: Fine.

56
00:03:31,356 --> 00:03:36,082
[SPEAKER_01]: And a refrigerator so that I have food that doesn't go bad, that I can't eat any of.

57
00:03:37,363 --> 00:03:38,024
[SPEAKER_03]: Fine, fine.

58
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:40,086
[SPEAKER_03]: Gamers gotta have priorities too.

59
00:03:40,146 --> 00:03:41,768
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's find out then what Loki's been up to.

60
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:42,549
[SPEAKER_02]: What have you been up to, Loki?

61
00:03:42,629 --> 00:03:44,071
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been playing a lot of stuff, actually.

62
00:03:45,152 --> 00:03:48,736
[SPEAKER_02]: The first game I started off with this week was Mercury for the PSP.

63
00:03:49,677 --> 00:03:51,720
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'm happy to say it sucked ass.

64
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:52,681
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

65
00:03:53,182 --> 00:03:55,405
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was a complete disappointment.

66
00:03:55,966 --> 00:03:57,668
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not what you think.

67
00:03:57,808 --> 00:04:00,332
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a puzzle game, but I was bored.

68
00:04:00,652 --> 00:04:03,216
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just completely retarded and I was just...

69
00:04:03,752 --> 00:04:07,074
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank God, you know, I was borrowing it and not buying it.

70
00:04:07,535 --> 00:04:10,016
[SPEAKER_02]: That's two puzzlers now on PSP you haven't liked.

71
00:04:10,156 --> 00:04:11,317
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's the same thing.

72
00:04:11,477 --> 00:04:12,718
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of load time also.

73
00:04:12,938 --> 00:04:14,619
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, what the hell's wrong with these people?

74
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,021
[SPEAKER_02]: But it sucks, so don't buy it.

75
00:04:18,162 --> 00:04:21,344
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I played Coded Arms for the PSP.

76
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:24,946
[SPEAKER_02]: PSP's first first-person shooter, and it's awesome.

77
00:04:26,067 --> 00:04:26,968
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really awesome.

78
00:04:27,408 --> 00:04:32,892
[SPEAKER_02]: The controls, they tried to do the best they could at the PSP, being that it only has one analog stick, so the other

79
00:04:33,444 --> 00:04:38,566
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, looking around is used with the four buttons, which isn't quite good.

80
00:04:38,906 --> 00:04:41,688
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not as smooth as I would have liked it to have been.

81
00:04:42,188 --> 00:04:45,309
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, it's the best they can really do for the PSP.

82
00:04:45,449 --> 00:04:46,430
[SPEAKER_02]: So they made the best of it.

83
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:48,150
[SPEAKER_02]: But other than that, it's okay.

84
00:04:48,471 --> 00:04:51,332
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish there was another analog stick on the PSP, then it would have been perfect.

85
00:04:51,732 --> 00:04:53,913
[SPEAKER_03]: What makes it so great, then, since you're only complaining about the controls?

86
00:04:53,933 --> 00:04:55,053
[SPEAKER_02]: Just the graphics are really good.

87
00:04:55,134 --> 00:04:56,734
[SPEAKER_02]: The game's just put together really well.

88
00:04:56,894 --> 00:04:59,856
[SPEAKER_02]: I was surprised on how well the graphics were.

89
00:05:00,036 --> 00:05:02,617
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like a lot of fun, actually.

90
00:05:04,597 --> 00:05:09,558
[SPEAKER_02]: The other game I played was Puzzle Bobble for the PSP, which is a Japanese import.

91
00:05:09,678 --> 00:05:11,499
[SPEAKER_02]: Not telling you how I got that one.

92
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,740
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like Puzzle Bobble, no surprise there.

93
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,460
[SPEAKER_03]: It's every system's mandatory Puzzle Bobble release in one way or another.

94
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,080
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good.

95
00:05:20,621 --> 00:05:24,721
[SPEAKER_03]: I know DarkSakura's going to yell at me for this, but a lot of you folks know it as Bust a Move.

96
00:05:26,562 --> 00:05:27,922
[SPEAKER_04]: Puzzle Bobble.

97
00:05:28,342 --> 00:05:32,103
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just saying, the American name was Bust a Move despite how you feel about Bust a Groove.

98
00:05:32,864 --> 00:05:33,444
[SPEAKER_03]: and all that stuff.

99
00:05:33,544 --> 00:05:38,127
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, moving away from the handheld systems, I bought Killer7.

100
00:05:39,067 --> 00:05:39,568
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great.

101
00:05:39,588 --> 00:05:40,928
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a very psychotic game.

102
00:05:41,388 --> 00:05:45,271
[SPEAKER_02]: The storyline, the game, it seems very anime-like to me.

103
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:46,851
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the setup?

104
00:05:46,951 --> 00:05:50,713
[SPEAKER_02]: The setup basically is, I mean, they don't really tell you much in the beginning.

105
00:05:50,853 --> 00:05:52,334
[SPEAKER_02]: You're this group of assassins.

106
00:05:52,394 --> 00:05:57,457
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, this guy, Harmon Smith, he's this wheelchair-bound assassin who has...

107
00:05:57,864 --> 00:05:58,265
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

108
00:06:11,016 --> 00:06:26,029
[SPEAKER_02]: There's, you know, you're not really sure if, you know, he's in the, if it's in the physical form or not, and what they make you, what they kind of lead you to believe is that you yourself, the player, are another one of his personalities, which is great.

109
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:31,194
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was really neat, and it's just, the storyline's very rich and just like full of

110
00:06:32,243 --> 00:06:33,785
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, a lot of detail and stuff.

111
00:06:33,825 --> 00:06:36,267
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've only played, you know, to the second level so far.

112
00:06:36,587 --> 00:06:39,449
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a lot of really crazy shit in there.

113
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:41,191
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, like, they're laughing.

114
00:06:41,271 --> 00:06:46,676
[SPEAKER_02]: The main villain or the enemies that you encounter are called these things called Heaven Smile.

115
00:06:46,936 --> 00:06:48,117
[SPEAKER_02]: And they look like these zombies.

116
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:51,980
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have these giant, like, grins on them.

117
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,461
[SPEAKER_02]: And they just go, ha, ha, ha.

118
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:54,262
[SPEAKER_02]: And they laugh.

119
00:06:55,163 --> 00:06:56,924
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a weird laugh.

120
00:06:57,065 --> 00:06:58,085
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they've got, like...

121
00:06:59,444 --> 00:07:05,907
[SPEAKER_02]: You shoot them and you collect the blood from them and you use the blood to... It's like that one game, Nano Breaker.

122
00:07:06,167 --> 00:07:06,607
[SPEAKER_02]: Sort of.

123
00:07:06,948 --> 00:07:07,688
[SPEAKER_03]: Oil, sorry.

124
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:10,189
[SPEAKER_02]: Sort of, but this is actually blood.

125
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:12,070
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really strange.

126
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:13,731
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole game is very psychotic.

127
00:07:13,751 --> 00:07:14,971
[SPEAKER_03]: How's that graphical look?

128
00:07:15,011 --> 00:07:16,892
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good.

129
00:07:16,912 --> 00:07:18,953
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all cel-shaded, but it's done really well.

130
00:07:19,233 --> 00:07:22,655
[SPEAKER_02]: The cutscenes are in anime.

131
00:07:23,075 --> 00:07:24,116
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really interesting.

132
00:07:24,516 --> 00:07:26,757
[SPEAKER_02]: They give you a lot of background about the characters and stuff.

133
00:07:27,168 --> 00:07:29,549
[SPEAKER_02]: But the whole game, I still don't really know what's going on yet.

134
00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:31,149
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the whole point.

135
00:07:31,369 --> 00:07:33,190
[SPEAKER_02]: You feel psychotic playing this game.

136
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:34,330
[SPEAKER_03]: So do you recommend this one?

137
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:34,871
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

138
00:07:35,051 --> 00:07:36,171
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very different game.

139
00:07:36,231 --> 00:07:39,532
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a storyline that's about as deep as Silent Hill.

140
00:07:39,752 --> 00:07:46,054
[SPEAKER_02]: And it plays, to me, I mean, everyone's knocking the rail system where you're running around limited movement.

141
00:07:46,294 --> 00:07:48,715
[SPEAKER_02]: But it plays, to me, sort of like Alone in the Dark.

142
00:07:48,975 --> 00:07:50,736
[SPEAKER_02]: There's puzzle solving and stuff like that.

143
00:07:51,739 --> 00:07:54,042
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of Silent Hill, since you brought it up, I have to put this in real fast.

144
00:07:54,063 --> 00:07:55,825
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been following what's going on with the movie.

145
00:07:56,306 --> 00:07:59,210
[SPEAKER_03]: They're putting Pyramid Head from Silent Hill 2 is going to be in the movie.

146
00:08:00,592 --> 00:08:01,273
[SPEAKER_04]: Get this.

147
00:08:02,235 --> 00:08:06,361
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is just going to let you know, oh my gosh, we might get a video game movie done right in every way.

148
00:08:07,001 --> 00:08:08,783
[SPEAKER_03]: and Akira Yamaoka is producing the soundtrack.

149
00:08:10,044 --> 00:08:10,384
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

150
00:08:10,524 --> 00:08:12,846
[SPEAKER_03]: And Akira Yamaoka actually did the music for the Silent Hills.

151
00:08:13,106 --> 00:08:15,188
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're not violating that.

152
00:08:15,268 --> 00:08:20,632
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, I was going to have a problem with Silent Hill with Akira Yamaoka because half of Silent Hill is the mood of the music and everything.

153
00:08:20,672 --> 00:08:22,353
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm just very excited for this movie now.

154
00:08:22,593 --> 00:08:24,215
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's incredible.

155
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:26,877
[SPEAKER_02]: The music and mood of this game is really weird too.

156
00:08:26,997 --> 00:08:30,359
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, it's really, you've got to play Killer7.

157
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,580
[SPEAKER_02]: At least rent it once.

158
00:08:31,721 --> 00:08:33,782
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just so strange.

159
00:08:33,942 --> 00:08:34,883
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, you've got to play it.

160
00:08:35,626 --> 00:08:36,927
[SPEAKER_02]: Dear Yamaoka-san, I love you, I love you, I love you.

161
00:08:48,624 --> 00:08:51,727
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.

162
00:08:51,787 --> 00:08:52,988
[SPEAKER_03]: We are not above groveling.

163
00:08:53,048 --> 00:08:53,649
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, Loki.

164
00:08:53,749 --> 00:08:59,234
[SPEAKER_02]: Other than that, I won a free PSP, and I ended up selling it for about $150.

165
00:09:00,095 --> 00:09:04,859
[SPEAKER_02]: But I sold it to someone that's in our company, and I'm also going to get the hookup from them.

166
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:08,002
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to give me a copy as soon as they get it of Advent Children.

167
00:09:08,462 --> 00:09:09,363
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe a UMD.

168
00:09:09,503 --> 00:09:10,424
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

169
00:09:10,544 --> 00:09:10,905
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

170
00:09:11,265 --> 00:09:13,647
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had to knock the price down for them.

171
00:09:13,667 --> 00:09:13,988
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

172
00:09:14,648 --> 00:09:16,969
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but, uh, yeah, that's pretty much all I've been doing.

173
00:09:16,989 --> 00:09:19,230
[SPEAKER_02]: Killer7's awesome, and I'm gonna play all the way through it.

174
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:21,471
[SPEAKER_02]: Destroy All Humans, I've already beat it, and it was fun.

175
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:26,494
[SPEAKER_02]: How was, without giving away the ending, were you, I heard, I heard rumors that the ending was a bit of a letdown.

176
00:09:27,354 --> 00:09:29,455
[SPEAKER_02]: Eh, it's your typical ending for a game.

177
00:09:29,595 --> 00:09:32,837
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't like, I, there really, there's not high expectations.

178
00:09:32,857 --> 00:09:40,020
[SPEAKER_02]: The, the end of the game, you have, like, two boss fights, and that's kind of weird, because there's no boss fights throughout the whole game, and then you fight these two bosses, and it's like,

179
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:46,024
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, they're a little bit stronger than they should be, but this is retarded.

180
00:09:46,524 --> 00:09:52,049
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole point of the game is that you've got the same guy that does the voice acting for Zim, and he's in it, and it's great.

181
00:09:52,109 --> 00:09:52,849
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I love about it.

182
00:09:52,869 --> 00:09:53,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, good.

183
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:54,410
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that you're done with it, I can borrow it.

184
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:55,131
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the important thing.

185
00:09:55,671 --> 00:09:57,453
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you can't, because you don't have a US PlayStation 2.

186
00:09:58,274 --> 00:09:59,556
[SPEAKER_03]: I will very soon.

187
00:09:59,736 --> 00:10:02,640
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm working on that because I'm sick of having only a Japanese one.

188
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:12,713
[SPEAKER_03]: Although I'll tell you what, if I had a Japanese PlayStation, or if I had the drive, I do have a Japanese PlayStation 2, if I had the money to import, I would have imported We Heart Katamari this week.

189
00:10:13,234 --> 00:10:14,294
[SPEAKER_03]: It was released in Japan.

190
00:10:14,434 --> 00:10:15,015
[SPEAKER_03]: It's awesome.

191
00:10:15,255 --> 00:10:18,136
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually want to play little bits from the soundtrack for you guys.

192
00:10:18,156 --> 00:10:23,678
[SPEAKER_03]: Just little, little snippets because, you know, playing music in podcasts is, you know, I don't know, it's questionable.

193
00:10:23,718 --> 00:10:28,880
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't think they'll mind the free plug if we just play a little snippet here from the soundtrack.

194
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,961
[SPEAKER_03]: So what I want to play for you guys is a little snippet.

195
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:33,501
[SPEAKER_03]: First off, you have to hear this.

196
00:10:34,361 --> 00:10:35,002
[SPEAKER_03]: This is great.

197
00:10:35,042 --> 00:10:38,023
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the training music in the new We Heart Katamari.

198
00:10:38,323 --> 00:10:39,523
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like beatboxing.

199
00:10:39,563 --> 00:10:41,064
[SPEAKER_03]: It's this Japanese beatbox guy.

200
00:10:41,084 --> 00:10:41,504
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen to this.

201
00:10:56,677 --> 00:10:57,378
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you expect?

202
00:10:57,458 --> 00:11:03,523
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the kind of thing you'd expect from the sequel to Katamari Damacy, so I'm not disappointed at all.

203
00:11:03,543 --> 00:11:05,084
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the game, just the premise of the game.

204
00:11:05,204 --> 00:11:08,467
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically the Prince of the Cosmos or whatever.

205
00:11:09,868 --> 00:11:13,351
[SPEAKER_02]: He's doing stuff for the fans of the previous game.

206
00:11:13,451 --> 00:11:14,612
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the story of the game.

207
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:15,193
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cute.

208
00:11:15,353 --> 00:11:15,873
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's another one.

209
00:11:15,893 --> 00:11:17,795
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a quick snippet from the introduction of the game.

210
00:11:25,959 --> 00:11:29,182
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see Katamari Damacy, The Broadway Show

211
00:11:49,437 --> 00:11:50,178
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

212
00:12:08,277 --> 00:12:08,917
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

213
00:12:24,989 --> 00:12:40,542
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure the game is great if you're into that kind of thing because it's definitely a pretty looking game and a lot of the elements in it are very cool like they have like the voting with page up and down and just the aspect of it the setup is really good but honestly me personally I just couldn't get into it like it was seriously one of those things where I'm just like

214
00:12:41,306 --> 00:12:44,188
[SPEAKER_03]: I really want to like this game, but it's just not my thing.

215
00:12:44,268 --> 00:12:45,629
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't get into this.

216
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:49,852
[SPEAKER_03]: My feeble brain cannot handle this game for some reason because I kept shooting my own guys.

217
00:12:50,052 --> 00:12:50,773
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

218
00:12:50,813 --> 00:12:52,594
[SPEAKER_02]: I just didn't get it.

219
00:12:52,674 --> 00:12:57,197
[SPEAKER_02]: One more addition to the Killer7 thing, just to tell you how crazy it is.

220
00:12:57,578 --> 00:13:00,180
[SPEAKER_02]: You talk to a severed head a lot of times.

221
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,280
[SPEAKER_03]: That has nothing to do with what I'm talking about.

222
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:01,661
[SPEAKER_03]: You're done.

223
00:13:01,701 --> 00:13:02,021
[SPEAKER_03]: You're done.

224
00:13:03,007 --> 00:13:10,257
[SPEAKER_03]: But Battlefield 2, my only disappointment with it, I'm sure it's a fun game if you're into the games, and it would be a great party game.

225
00:13:11,338 --> 00:13:12,500
[SPEAKER_03]: I gotta try that still.

226
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:19,069
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not gonna give a final verdict on the game until I can really play it with some other live people, except I don't know who in their right mind would want to play that game with me because I'm awful at it.

227
00:13:19,509 --> 00:13:48,125
[SPEAKER_03]: but um my only disappointment is that I actually expected the graphics to be even was considering the system requirements for that game oh my gosh it's like you have to have a 1.7 gig machine and all this stuff crazy high-end video card um luckily I have a lot of that stuff but I would I was kind of expecting the game to look better maybe I just didn't get far enough in it though so I'm kind of I'm not gonna dog on it for the graphics I mean it is a nice looking game it's just I would have expected it to be the best darn thing I've ever seen considering the

228
00:13:49,155 --> 00:13:49,956
[SPEAKER_03]: technical requirements.

229
00:13:50,236 --> 00:13:52,458
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's my half-assed review of Battlefield 2.

230
00:13:52,698 --> 00:13:54,159
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I tried for you guys.

231
00:13:54,219 --> 00:13:56,221
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried to play a War Sim game and get into it.

232
00:13:56,581 --> 00:13:57,902
[SPEAKER_03]: Just couldn't do it.

233
00:13:58,362 --> 00:14:02,385
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll stick with Techie.

234
00:14:03,366 --> 00:14:04,046
[SPEAKER_01]: What was that game?

235
00:14:04,466 --> 00:14:05,968
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember the English name of it now.

236
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:10,491
[SPEAKER_01]: With the huge controller that I got Dan.

237
00:14:10,962 --> 00:14:13,344
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, the MechWarrior?

238
00:14:13,684 --> 00:14:14,165
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

239
00:14:14,425 --> 00:14:14,986
[SPEAKER_03]: MechAssault.

240
00:14:15,446 --> 00:14:18,168
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that controller didn't go to MechAssault.

241
00:14:18,889 --> 00:14:20,851
[SPEAKER_01]: It was Steel Battalion.

242
00:14:21,331 --> 00:14:22,252
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's it.

243
00:14:22,532 --> 00:14:25,094
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll stick with Steel Battalion because it has an eject button.

244
00:14:25,795 --> 00:14:26,716
[SPEAKER_03]: The eject button was cool.

245
00:14:27,516 --> 00:14:29,478
[SPEAKER_03]: Dahlia Gillespie, Alessa Gillespie Officer Gucci

246
00:14:56,755 --> 00:15:03,238
[SPEAKER_01]: and someone named Sharon and a bunch of... The only actors in here I've really heard of is Sean Bean, which is pretty cool, because he can be wicked.

247
00:15:04,739 --> 00:15:06,759
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so more to come on the Silent Hill movie as we get it.

248
00:15:06,779 --> 00:15:08,240
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get into some other gaming news.

249
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,701
[SPEAKER_03]: First off, I think this is very interesting.

250
00:15:11,221 --> 00:15:25,548
[SPEAKER_03]: The makers of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, Rockstar Games, is being held under the microscope right now by the ESRB, and what this whole thing centers around is basically the sex mod, which some of you guys... I think we've talked about it on this show previously.

251
00:15:25,568 --> 00:15:25,788
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

252
00:15:26,648 --> 00:15:30,329
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, you're that hack crack guy, tell us about, set up this sex mod, how does this work?

253
00:15:30,349 --> 00:15:54,533
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, basically there's unfinished code that's in the game, or basically locked out code, and, you know, people being, you know, the hackers that they are looking through the code, they found it, and so they enable it back in the game, much like how with Grand Theft Auto's, or not San Andreas, Vice City and stuff, they had, they're working on Multi Theft Auto, which is using the multiplayer code that was in there to, you know, play online.

254
00:15:54,946 --> 00:15:55,667
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

255
00:16:11,484 --> 00:16:13,506
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, that's what the whole fuss is about.

256
00:16:13,826 --> 00:16:16,548
[SPEAKER_02]: And apparently it is very graphic from the video that I've seen.

257
00:16:16,588 --> 00:16:17,449
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't done that yet.

258
00:16:17,469 --> 00:16:20,291
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, DarkSakura, you found a site with pictures and stuff?

259
00:16:20,331 --> 00:16:21,792
[SPEAKER_03]: What did you find out about this?

260
00:16:22,192 --> 00:16:23,293
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually closed it.

261
00:16:24,894 --> 00:16:28,937
[SPEAKER_01]: It just had three positions and showed pictures of them all.

262
00:16:30,158 --> 00:16:36,363
[SPEAKER_01]: But it also gave a link to the site how to get to said mod.

263
00:16:36,403 --> 00:16:37,504
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me a second, I'll get it up again.

264
00:16:37,624 --> 00:16:37,764
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

265
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:42,625
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, you can download it on the major Grand Theft Auto mod sites.

266
00:16:43,165 --> 00:16:46,068
[SPEAKER_02]: And it starts off, where are you going?

267
00:16:46,168 --> 00:16:47,189
[SPEAKER_02]: For coffee.

268
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:52,254
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the woman orally pleasures you.

269
00:16:52,274 --> 00:16:53,495
[SPEAKER_02]: We get it, we get it, we get it.

270
00:16:54,456 --> 00:16:55,317
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very graphic.

271
00:16:55,437 --> 00:16:58,841
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, hmm, well, yeah, that would be pushing the envelope there, wouldn't it?

272
00:17:00,502 --> 00:17:08,249
[SPEAKER_01]: Where I found the pictures was on ukresistance.co.uk for the June 2005 news.

273
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:10,450
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, pictures there.

274
00:17:11,131 --> 00:17:15,695
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and the ESRB is now kind of looking going, you know, should this be an adults only game?

275
00:17:15,715 --> 00:17:26,004
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the California Assemblyman Leland Yee is saying that this, basically he's kind of pushing behind this too, that the game should be rated adults only.

276
00:17:26,304 --> 00:17:27,786
[SPEAKER_03]: And the ESRB needs to take another look at this.

277
00:17:27,866 --> 00:17:28,006
[SPEAKER_03]: But

278
00:17:28,945 --> 00:17:50,440
[SPEAKER_03]: I what the ESRB has to look at is did Rockstar sneak this by were they intending this to be a part of the game and I say if you have had to mod or crack the game no it's not it's unfinished stuff it's just like how there was a skateboard weapon and people have unlocked the skateboard weapon it's code that was in there that's unfinished and they they took it out and it's the same thing

279
00:17:51,254 --> 00:18:03,961
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I brought up on our live show, there was Bloody War 3, all the little pictures hidden in the game, that if you put in the debug code by using a GameShark or Game Genie, lo and behold.

280
00:18:03,981 --> 00:18:12,365
[SPEAKER_03]: And as one of you guys brought up on the live show as well, the nude patch for the Sims, EA didn't get sued over that because that was something that was out of their control.

281
00:18:12,726 --> 00:18:13,186
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

282
00:18:13,866 --> 00:18:14,286
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

283
00:18:14,386 --> 00:18:19,209
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, even though they accidentally left the code in the game, that doesn't mean that

284
00:18:20,195 --> 00:18:25,557
[SPEAKER_03]: They're violating the license agreement by doing that, right?

285
00:18:25,577 --> 00:18:30,018
[SPEAKER_02]: Or the gay sex ending for SimCopter What?

286
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:34,180
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a gay sex ending for SimCopter How have I not heard of this?

287
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:45,804
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a long time ago, I remember seeing something about this Well, SimCopter, the graphics weren't that great But it was a bunch of stick figures, guys, you know, having anal sex

288
00:18:46,408 --> 00:18:48,570
[SPEAKER_02]: And I kid you not, it was in the game.

289
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:51,412
[SPEAKER_02]: It was an Easter egg that some developer hid in there.

290
00:18:51,432 --> 00:18:52,953
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, what the hell?

291
00:18:53,514 --> 00:18:54,455
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was in there.

292
00:18:54,655 --> 00:18:58,097
[SPEAKER_03]: In that context, the term Easter egg is like ten times funnier.

293
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:58,478
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

294
00:18:59,018 --> 00:18:59,318
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

295
00:19:00,279 --> 00:19:00,680
[SPEAKER_03]: It's weird.

296
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:00,920
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

297
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,902
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, so quick poll.

298
00:19:04,022 --> 00:19:05,764
[SPEAKER_03]: Is anything going to happen to Rockstar because of this?

299
00:19:05,984 --> 00:19:06,364
[SPEAKER_03]: I say no.

300
00:19:07,665 --> 00:19:11,768
[SPEAKER_03]: The only thing that will happen is their game will sell more because people want to play it.

301
00:19:11,929 --> 00:19:14,791
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to play a game with simulated boobies.

302
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:23,036
[SPEAKER_03]: As I also suggested on the live show earlier tonight, mirror the rating systems that the movies use.

303
00:19:23,137 --> 00:19:29,342
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it would be a good way for this rating system to become more socially acceptable because even though we as gamers know enough about this system,

304
00:19:30,259 --> 00:19:31,020
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think parents do.

305
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,921
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop letting your kids play these games.

306
00:19:33,161 --> 00:19:34,262
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, it's just mature.

307
00:19:34,782 --> 00:19:38,524
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't sell it to minors, so you're buying it for them.

308
00:19:38,784 --> 00:19:39,745
[SPEAKER_02]: Shame on you.

309
00:19:40,205 --> 00:19:40,906
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are you coming?

310
00:19:41,186 --> 00:19:44,768
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know it was going to be full of blood and violence and stuff.

311
00:19:44,828 --> 00:19:46,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though on the back it says, full of blood and violence.

312
00:19:49,371 --> 00:19:50,992
[SPEAKER_03]: This is interesting.

313
00:19:51,492 --> 00:19:52,213
[SPEAKER_03]: Another story now.

314
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:53,173
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to get into another story.

315
00:19:53,373 --> 00:19:59,317
[SPEAKER_03]: Xbox is going to be getting... You remember how Fable came out for the Xbox and then people were like, oh, it's good, but it's short.

316
00:19:59,693 --> 00:20:04,194
[SPEAKER_03]: So they released the version on the PC called The Lost Chapters, which is like a longer version of Fable.

317
00:20:04,434 --> 00:20:05,015
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, guess what?

318
00:20:05,275 --> 00:20:07,495
[SPEAKER_03]: Xbox is now getting Fable The Lost Chapters.

319
00:20:08,076 --> 00:20:10,276
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I read about this, I was like, damn it.

320
00:20:10,336 --> 00:20:12,557
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I just spent $30 on Fable not that long ago.

321
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:13,257
[SPEAKER_03]: And get this.

322
00:20:13,557 --> 00:20:15,918
[SPEAKER_03]: Fable The Lost Chapters is going to be a budget title, $20.

323
00:20:16,898 --> 00:20:19,639
[SPEAKER_03]: So people like me who just recently bought the game are SOL.

324
00:20:20,459 --> 00:20:21,080
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

325
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:22,680
[SPEAKER_03]: Jerks.

326
00:20:24,601 --> 00:20:26,981
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but that's good news for those folks that haven't played the game yet.

327
00:20:27,262 --> 00:20:28,722
[SPEAKER_03]: This will give them a good excuse to check it out.

328
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:31,356
[SPEAKER_03]: How about we open up the old mailbag?

329
00:20:31,376 --> 00:20:34,877
[SPEAKER_03]: We got a lot of great letters from last week's show, so I think it's time we open up the mailbag.

330
00:20:34,897 --> 00:20:35,717
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys ready for this?

331
00:20:36,358 --> 00:20:36,578
[SPEAKER_03]: Ready.

332
00:20:36,898 --> 00:20:38,379
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's go into the mailbag.

333
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:49,643
[SPEAKER_03]: First email came to us from Acer800, and Acer800 is a girl gamer and wanted to say this.

334
00:20:49,703 --> 00:20:53,325
[SPEAKER_03]: Your comments on girl gaming last week were pretty interesting and sadly true.

335
00:20:53,925 --> 00:20:55,726
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been playing games since I was a wee girl.

336
00:20:55,786 --> 00:20:58,267
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the first games I played was Mortal Kombat.

337
00:20:58,287 --> 00:20:58,467
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

338
00:20:59,485 --> 00:21:05,726
[SPEAKER_03]: I love fighting games and sport games and the feeling of how smug guys are shocked when I kick their butts at Soul Calibur 2.

339
00:21:06,755 --> 00:21:09,697
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, you're a great representation of a girl gamer.

340
00:21:09,717 --> 00:21:10,037
[SPEAKER_03]: You rock!

341
00:21:10,077 --> 00:21:10,798
[SPEAKER_03]: Aww, that warms my heart.

342
00:21:36,995 --> 00:21:40,336
[SPEAKER_03]: That's quite an achievement there to warm DarkSakura's cold little black heart.

343
00:21:40,576 --> 00:21:41,156
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just kidding.

344
00:21:42,557 --> 00:21:43,337
[SPEAKER_03]: I got shot a look.

345
00:21:43,757 --> 00:21:44,878
[SPEAKER_01]: My heart's not black.

346
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:51,380
[SPEAKER_02]: Now all you need to do, DarkSakura, is you need to lick a PSP so you can become famous like that one chick who did nothing.

347
00:21:53,081 --> 00:21:53,461
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh?

348
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:54,321
What?

349
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:58,042
[SPEAKER_02]: The one that's on the red-ass baboon site or whatever.

350
00:21:58,082 --> 00:22:00,003
[SPEAKER_02]: The stupid girl gamer reviewer.

351
00:22:00,123 --> 00:22:00,463
[SPEAKER_03]: Forget it.

352
00:22:00,848 --> 00:22:04,952
[SPEAKER_02]: The one that's like a chauvinistic, or no, a feminist, yeah, I don't like her.

353
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:10,137
[SPEAKER_03]: Look, the best thing I can say, I'm like, okay, whatever, you're on your own world there.

354
00:22:10,818 --> 00:22:15,442
[SPEAKER_03]: The best response I can give to that is, you go, girl.

355
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:16,583
[SPEAKER_03]: You go, girl.

356
00:22:18,465 --> 00:22:18,625
What?

357
00:22:19,751 --> 00:22:20,672
[SPEAKER_01]: Ego++ I love the boys too

358
00:22:40,314 --> 00:22:45,157
[SPEAKER_03]: We had an email from Rob, sent us an email, and Rob had a comment on the women gaming issue as well.

359
00:22:45,617 --> 00:22:53,101
[SPEAKER_03]: One huge way to get girls and women to actually like video gaming would be to stop putting out girl games, quote unquote, that stink.

360
00:22:53,562 --> 00:22:59,785
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like a lot of girl games for preteens are created with entry level and inexperienced programmers to cut their teeth on.

361
00:23:00,306 --> 00:23:03,848
[SPEAKER_03]: This makes the preteens hate video games when they grow up, I imagine.

362
00:23:05,171 --> 00:23:06,793
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting perspectives.

363
00:23:07,153 --> 00:23:09,576
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop putting out such amateurish pink games.

364
00:23:09,616 --> 00:23:10,498
[SPEAKER_02]: I call them the pink games.

365
00:23:10,658 --> 00:23:11,999
[SPEAKER_02]: Or Mary-Kate and Ashley games.

366
00:23:12,019 --> 00:23:16,685
[SPEAKER_02]: Buena Vista Interactive needs to stop putting out titles for the Game Boy Advance.

367
00:23:17,005 --> 00:23:19,529
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, for example, Lizzie McGuire.

368
00:23:19,909 --> 00:23:21,010
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a Raven 3.

369
00:23:22,672 --> 00:23:24,455
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, and just like, you know...

370
00:23:25,724 --> 00:23:26,565
[SPEAKER_02]: Games like that.

371
00:23:26,585 --> 00:23:28,407
[SPEAKER_02]: They're platformers and just awful.

372
00:23:28,948 --> 00:23:29,429
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop.

373
00:23:29,629 --> 00:23:30,410
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what they need?

374
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:34,154
[SPEAKER_02]: They need more puzzle games for the home consoles.

375
00:23:34,474 --> 00:23:35,395
[SPEAKER_02]: They need to hire me.

376
00:23:35,415 --> 00:23:35,656
[SPEAKER_01]: None.

377
00:23:39,966 --> 00:23:42,307
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to hire me to design games for them.

378
00:23:43,247 --> 00:23:47,608
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be chick with big gun shoots a bunch of idiots.

379
00:23:47,628 --> 00:23:48,968
[SPEAKER_01]: Wasn't that Tomb Raider?

380
00:23:49,508 --> 00:23:50,128
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no.

381
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:52,689
[SPEAKER_03]: That's slut with big guns.

382
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:53,409
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, sorry.

383
00:23:55,209 --> 00:23:57,010
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to spend too much more time on this topic.

384
00:23:57,170 --> 00:24:02,191
[SPEAKER_01]: The best thing about Tomb Raider was Tomb Raider 2 because you could do a little button press code and shit explode.

385
00:24:03,237 --> 00:24:04,678
[SPEAKER_01]: You could also go on her balcony.

386
00:24:04,698 --> 00:24:08,602
[SPEAKER_01]: You could shut the butler in the walk-in for a year and he wouldn't follow you anymore.

387
00:24:09,263 --> 00:24:11,245
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you could jump off the balcony and she'd break her neck.

388
00:24:11,705 --> 00:24:12,646
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do like a dive.

389
00:24:14,227 --> 00:24:14,407
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

390
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:16,850
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why Tomb Raider 2 is the best of the series.

391
00:24:17,955 --> 00:24:21,917
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I think more girls would like Final Fantasy X if they gave it a chance, you know?

392
00:24:22,277 --> 00:24:23,478
[SPEAKER_03]: Final Fantasy X?

393
00:24:23,518 --> 00:24:24,878
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a game everybody can like.

394
00:24:24,978 --> 00:24:25,899
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, but think about it.

395
00:24:26,119 --> 00:24:27,840
[SPEAKER_03]: There are some... X-2.

396
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:33,782
[SPEAKER_03]: Great... Well, X-2 is more like a girl power type game, but X... There's guys and girls who can agree.

397
00:24:33,823 --> 00:24:37,764
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the girls in that are great characters, and there's different types.

398
00:24:37,784 --> 00:24:42,967
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you have your kind of slutty Riku, but Yuna's a strong woman, and Lulu's kind of the sassy one.

399
00:24:43,007 --> 00:24:45,448
[SPEAKER_01]: Yuna is just determined, but she's a...

400
00:24:46,389 --> 00:24:48,213
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I'm self-spoken.

401
00:24:48,353 --> 00:24:51,499
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I'm going to be a summoner and die.

402
00:24:52,762 --> 00:24:55,728
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh wait, this sucks and my man is... I don't want to spoil it.

403
00:24:55,748 --> 00:24:56,830
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, alright, shh.

404
00:24:57,311 --> 00:24:57,732
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get...

405
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:58,980
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get to another email.

406
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,821
[SPEAKER_03]: This email came to us from Tom.

407
00:25:01,241 --> 00:25:02,841
[SPEAKER_03]: Tom W., thank you very much for the email.

408
00:25:03,961 --> 00:25:09,243
[SPEAKER_03]: Wants to let us know that we actually, last week we were talking about Bomberman and we said we couldn't think of one on the Genesis.

409
00:25:09,643 --> 00:25:14,424
[SPEAKER_03]: He wanted to let us know there actually was a Bomberman game on the Genesis, Mega Bomberman.

410
00:25:14,724 --> 00:25:16,224
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually have that somewhere.

411
00:25:16,424 --> 00:25:17,104
[SPEAKER_03]: And you forgot.

412
00:25:17,365 --> 00:25:19,565
[SPEAKER_01]: And I forgot because I have too damn many games.

413
00:25:19,605 --> 00:25:22,986
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, he also sent us a picture, so thank you very much for bringing back the memories there.

414
00:25:23,106 --> 00:25:24,826
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, Mega Bomberman was pretty cool.

415
00:25:24,846 --> 00:25:26,567
[SPEAKER_03]: We make mistakes, what can we say?

416
00:25:27,107 --> 00:25:27,487
[SPEAKER_01]: Except me.

417
00:25:28,226 --> 00:25:28,486
[SPEAKER_01]: R. Love PS3

418
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:53,341
[SPEAKER_03]: He basically says in his email here, the reality is that this is a way for Sony to get more money from people by nickel and diming consumers on peripherals.

419
00:25:53,641 --> 00:25:55,443
[SPEAKER_03]: This is one thing I hate about Sony.

420
00:25:55,724 --> 00:26:02,192
[SPEAKER_03]: They put out a hard drive with Final Fantasy XI bundled because they knew someone would buy it with the assumption that there would be content that uses it.

421
00:26:03,396 --> 00:26:04,676
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't say I disagree.

422
00:26:04,716 --> 00:26:06,717
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the nickel and diming is one way to look at it.

423
00:26:06,937 --> 00:26:09,958
[SPEAKER_03]: Why bundle it in when we can get you to charge more?

424
00:26:09,998 --> 00:26:11,879
[SPEAKER_03]: But all the game companies are doing it.

425
00:26:11,979 --> 00:26:12,479
[SPEAKER_03]: Take GameCube.

426
00:26:12,499 --> 00:26:15,180
[SPEAKER_01]: Nintendo is the most notorious.

427
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:15,540
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

428
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:15,920
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo.

429
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,401
[SPEAKER_03]: Take the Xbox.

430
00:26:17,461 --> 00:26:17,841
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.

431
00:26:17,921 --> 00:26:19,181
[SPEAKER_03]: The DVD playback kit.

432
00:26:19,321 --> 00:26:21,682
[SPEAKER_03]: If that wasn't nickel and diming you, I don't know what is.

433
00:26:21,942 --> 00:26:22,362
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?

434
00:26:22,382 --> 00:26:24,043
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to play DVDs, you cunts.

435
00:26:24,363 --> 00:26:29,825
[SPEAKER_01]: Even back on the Dreamcast, they put out this broadband adapter that two games used.

436
00:26:30,825 --> 00:26:32,746
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't even have it accessible on PSO.

437
00:26:33,832 --> 00:26:37,474
[SPEAKER_03]: So from my perspective, you have a point, but all the game companies are doing this.

438
00:26:37,534 --> 00:26:38,395
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not just Sony.

439
00:26:38,815 --> 00:26:44,319
[SPEAKER_03]: But the other part is that, that being said, a hard drive in PlayStation 3 would have been a bigger deal than it is.

440
00:26:44,719 --> 00:26:48,141
[SPEAKER_03]: That is because there would have been games and such that would support having it.

441
00:26:48,321 --> 00:26:54,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Xbox had that Blinks game, an in-game custom playlist on certain games which made a case, if not a small one, for having it.

442
00:26:55,126 --> 00:27:01,410
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love to believe that developers could dig up a bit more creativity if they realized more uses for an in-console hard drive.

443
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:06,452
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know what rocked about the Xbox hard drive is modding it and putting games on it.

444
00:27:06,512 --> 00:27:07,052
[SPEAKER_03]: Woohoo!

445
00:27:07,132 --> 00:27:07,472
[SPEAKER_03]: Fun!

446
00:27:09,773 --> 00:27:14,275
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't disagree with what he's saying, though, because loading times could be reduced and things of that sort.

447
00:27:14,295 --> 00:27:15,455
[SPEAKER_03]: And he also talks about his email.

448
00:27:15,495 --> 00:27:16,595
[SPEAKER_03]: That's exactly why.

449
00:27:17,236 --> 00:27:19,697
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what my PlayStation 2 hard drive is for?

450
00:27:20,657 --> 00:27:21,557
[SPEAKER_01]: HD loader.

451
00:27:21,717 --> 00:27:25,078
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I use it for shortening those load times.

452
00:27:25,479 --> 00:27:28,420
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, of games that I have owned.

453
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:29,300
[SPEAKER_01]: I have.

454
00:27:30,257 --> 00:27:31,298
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for the emails, you guys.

455
00:27:31,338 --> 00:27:32,479
[SPEAKER_03]: We always love your perspectives.

456
00:27:32,739 --> 00:27:34,621
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have a comment, you can always email that to us.

457
00:27:34,721 --> 00:27:37,823
[SPEAKER_03]: Tugo at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the address.

458
00:27:38,644 --> 00:27:40,405
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's look at some more gaming news going on.

459
00:27:40,525 --> 00:27:41,606
[SPEAKER_03]: Space Invaders.

460
00:27:41,966 --> 00:27:42,987
[SPEAKER_03]: You know Space Invaders.

461
00:27:43,047 --> 00:27:47,771
[SPEAKER_03]: According to the latest issue of Famitsu, Space Invaders is coming to the PSP.

462
00:27:48,691 --> 00:27:51,193
[SPEAKER_03]: And this will be released in Japan for $45.

463
00:27:52,374 --> 00:27:53,355
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can't help but think...

464
00:27:55,316 --> 00:27:57,197
[SPEAKER_03]: I can play it on my Atari for free.

465
00:27:57,717 --> 00:28:02,278
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a souped-up version of the classic, but from the screenshot I saw... With a trackball!

466
00:28:02,858 --> 00:28:04,759
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you've got that little analog thing, I guess.

467
00:28:05,179 --> 00:28:09,520
[SPEAKER_03]: From the screenshot I saw, it just looked like a souped-up version of the original, but nothing to scream about.

468
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,061
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm thinking, $45 for Space Invaders?

469
00:28:12,081 --> 00:28:15,982
[SPEAKER_03]: Which, I'm sorry, in my opinion, Space Invaders is kind of one of those overrated classics.

470
00:28:16,522 --> 00:28:17,963
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, to me...

471
00:28:18,803 --> 00:28:21,644
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, give me a game like Galaxian, Jairus.

472
00:28:21,664 --> 00:28:23,906
[SPEAKER_01]: I think GORF for the same game was better.

473
00:28:23,926 --> 00:28:24,566
[SPEAKER_01]: GORF was awesome.

474
00:28:25,746 --> 00:28:27,667
[SPEAKER_03]: GORF was like three different games in one.

475
00:28:27,928 --> 00:28:29,809
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not all about the Space Invaders.

476
00:28:30,029 --> 00:28:31,629
[SPEAKER_03]: Pac-Man Warship, I get that.

477
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:33,510
[SPEAKER_03]: Space Invader Warship, not so much.

478
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:38,513
[SPEAKER_03]: But admittedly, and before someone sends an email on this, I understand it was a huge deal in Japan.

479
00:28:38,533 --> 00:28:40,274
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a much bigger deal there than it was here even.

480
00:28:41,178 --> 00:28:41,578
[SPEAKER_03]: I can see that.

481
00:28:41,598 --> 00:28:46,564
[SPEAKER_03]: And this game is only announced for Japan at this time, so maybe it makes a little more sense to that.

482
00:28:46,624 --> 00:28:46,884
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

483
00:28:46,924 --> 00:28:48,366
[SPEAKER_03]: But even the recent Pac-Man titles have all been budget.

484
00:28:48,386 --> 00:28:53,991
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the whole reason for cost, though, is, you know, it was the same reason why Nintendo 64 games were so expensive.

485
00:28:54,952 --> 00:28:58,216
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, uh, you know, they're, uh,

486
00:28:59,677 --> 00:29:00,558
[SPEAKER_01]: and more.

487
00:29:15,914 --> 00:29:16,354
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

488
00:29:16,655 --> 00:29:19,517
[SPEAKER_03]: Atari did this.

489
00:29:19,557 --> 00:29:21,519
[SPEAKER_03]: They updated a bunch of their old games.

490
00:29:21,579 --> 00:29:22,800
[SPEAKER_03]: Pong was one of them.

491
00:29:23,821 --> 00:29:24,702
[SPEAKER_03]: Did they do Warlords?

492
00:29:24,742 --> 00:29:25,682
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember.

493
00:29:25,742 --> 00:29:27,384
[SPEAKER_03]: Frogger came out in here as well.

494
00:29:28,124 --> 00:29:30,967
[SPEAKER_02]: How many Frogger games have there been?

495
00:29:31,427 --> 00:29:31,647
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms.

496
00:29:31,687 --> 00:29:32,208
[SPEAKER_03]: Pac-Man.

497
00:29:32,228 --> 00:29:35,130
[SPEAKER_03]: They redid a lot of old games.

498
00:29:35,871 --> 00:29:39,194
[SPEAKER_01]: I just remember a version of Warlords being in Lunar.

499
00:29:40,595 --> 00:29:41,296
[SPEAKER_01]: Lords of Lunar.

500
00:29:42,457 --> 00:29:43,718
[SPEAKER_01]: When they put it out on PS2.

501
00:29:45,197 --> 00:29:46,377
[SPEAKER_03]: This strikes me as those updates.

502
00:29:46,557 --> 00:29:49,098
[SPEAKER_03]: And I do remember the Pong one was actually pretty cool.

503
00:29:49,338 --> 00:29:52,418
[SPEAKER_03]: But the rest of them... You want to talk about update games that are good?

504
00:29:52,618 --> 00:29:52,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh.

505
00:29:53,398 --> 00:29:55,279
[SPEAKER_02]: New Sega Ages have been announced.

506
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:56,159
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, really?

507
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:56,859
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

508
00:29:57,259 --> 00:29:57,999
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are good ones.

509
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:02,380
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, the one that I'm happiest about is Panzer Dragoon.

510
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:07,061
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to remake the whole game and include the original on it.

511
00:30:07,301 --> 00:30:08,421
[SPEAKER_02]: It's coming to the PS2.

512
00:30:08,581 --> 00:30:09,741
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people... I have that.

513
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:13,942
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people knocked the original classics that came out on PS2 saying it just...

514
00:30:14,822 --> 00:30:15,122
[SPEAKER_03]: and so on.

515
00:30:38,954 --> 00:30:41,635
[SPEAKER_02]: in order to give the game a perfect port for the first time.

516
00:30:41,655 --> 00:30:53,439
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see here, we've also got Gunstar Heroes Treasure Box, which is Gunstar Heroes, Dynamite Headdy, Alien Soldier, and it says three of the treasure's best known Mega Drive titles.

517
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,320
[SPEAKER_01]: His treasure rocks.

518
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:59,022
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and they also have Dynamite Deco, which was Die Hard in...

519
00:31:00,743 --> 00:31:02,104
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

520
00:31:23,015 --> 00:31:23,856
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

521
00:31:51,044 --> 00:31:54,147
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember kids, this is only to make backup copies of games you already own.

522
00:32:07,535 --> 00:32:07,996
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, okay.

523
00:32:08,356 --> 00:32:21,951
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the other thing that was announced is there's another group that's working on creating an external device to actually be able to run other types of memory cards.

524
00:32:21,971 --> 00:32:26,336
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, for example, USB flash drives, hard drives, and...

525
00:32:28,091 --> 00:32:32,595
[SPEAKER_02]: SD digital, SD cards and whatever, so basically other medias.

526
00:32:33,355 --> 00:32:40,981
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's another website, I believe WeAreBack is also them, with PSP development that they're going to make it so you can flash your PSP back to 1.5 or 1.0.

527
00:32:41,261 --> 00:32:41,501
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh boy.

528
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:45,931
[SPEAKER_02]: The shit has hit the fan.

529
00:32:46,812 --> 00:32:49,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty much, this would be... It's game over.

530
00:32:50,214 --> 00:32:53,016
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be interested to see if Sony doesn't try to shut some of that stuff down.

531
00:32:53,036 --> 00:32:54,357
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

532
00:32:54,437 --> 00:32:56,459
[SPEAKER_02]: Once it's on the internet, though, it's hard to get off.

533
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:57,139
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty hard.

534
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:03,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Other interesting things, though, I should mention, the DS, they have Super Nintendo and Nintendo emulators for it now, finally.

535
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:06,045
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, those are a little harder to come by.

536
00:33:06,065 --> 00:33:07,146
[SPEAKER_02]: A little harder to get on there, yeah.

537
00:33:07,166 --> 00:33:07,746
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.

538
00:33:08,807 --> 00:33:12,250
[SPEAKER_02]: They've actually started development on the PSP and the homebrew scene...

539
00:33:13,058 --> 00:33:13,339
[SPEAKER_02]: and so on.

540
00:33:30,444 --> 00:33:33,845
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, you know, it's kind of an audio program.

541
00:33:33,865 --> 00:33:35,546
[SPEAKER_02]: You can make your own mixes and stuff.

542
00:33:35,626 --> 00:33:37,887
[SPEAKER_02]: PSP Paints is out there, paint program.

543
00:33:38,547 --> 00:33:45,169
[SPEAKER_02]: And the best part also, and this isn't really hacking, is new colored PSPs are rumored to be coming out soon.

544
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:47,810
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the colors that's rumored is hot pink.

545
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:49,911
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, the actual, like, frames?

546
00:33:50,267 --> 00:33:51,707
[SPEAKER_03]: But not Sony endorsed.

547
00:33:52,068 --> 00:33:52,708
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it is Sony.

548
00:33:53,048 --> 00:33:53,148
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh!

549
00:33:54,108 --> 00:33:54,868
[SPEAKER_02]: In Japan, of course.

550
00:33:55,488 --> 00:33:57,069
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but the black one is so cool.

551
00:33:57,549 --> 00:33:59,730
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if they did a Sakura PSP, I'd have to have it.

552
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:01,850
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd go for a nice dark green.

553
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:03,571
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what's really going on right now.

554
00:34:03,591 --> 00:34:10,633
[SPEAKER_02]: If you'd want to play a good updated port of a game or whatever, the new Namco Battle Collection, all remade games.

555
00:34:10,693 --> 00:34:13,073
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got Rally-X, Dig Dug, and all that stuff.

556
00:34:13,433 --> 00:34:14,674
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one to check out over...

557
00:34:16,813 --> 00:34:20,618
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it the same updates that have been on GameCube previously?

558
00:34:20,658 --> 00:34:21,720
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't think so.

559
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:22,581
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll have to check that out.

560
00:34:23,522 --> 00:34:28,329
[SPEAKER_03]: I have one quick little hacking and cracking story.

561
00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:29,490
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my god, you're into Slash.

562
00:34:30,748 --> 00:34:31,969
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, that was a Freudian slip.

563
00:34:32,009 --> 00:34:32,289
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

564
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:34,651
[SPEAKER_03]: Quick hacking and cracking story.

565
00:34:34,691 --> 00:34:35,752
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this one's just cool.

566
00:34:36,512 --> 00:34:38,614
[SPEAKER_03]: This has to do with the program Stella.

567
00:34:38,694 --> 00:34:40,435
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an Atari 2600 emulator.

568
00:34:40,855 --> 00:34:49,021
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Fred Quimby, the guy who develops games for that emulator, he released a BASIC compiler that can be used to create games to run on Stella.

569
00:34:49,321 --> 00:34:53,324
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you think about it, using that same technology, you could actually make your own Atari 2600 games in BASIC.

570
00:34:55,253 --> 00:34:56,013
[SPEAKER_03]: I just think that's kind of cool.

571
00:34:56,033 --> 00:34:56,894
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how a lot of them are done.

572
00:34:57,014 --> 00:34:58,154
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why, I just think that's neat.

573
00:34:58,174 --> 00:34:59,195
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to know what else is cool?

574
00:34:59,275 --> 00:34:59,395
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

575
00:34:59,415 --> 00:35:04,777
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got an Amiga emulator on the PSP now, and you know what you can run on Amiga?

576
00:35:06,058 --> 00:35:06,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Monkey Island.

577
00:35:08,479 --> 00:35:14,422
[SPEAKER_03]: Stella, more information on that emulator, stella.sourceforge.net, and that's S-T-E-L-L-A.

578
00:35:14,522 --> 00:35:16,302
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, one last thing I forgot to mention.

579
00:35:16,482 --> 00:35:17,103
[SPEAKER_02]: GameMaker.

580
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:18,623
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember the GameMaker programs?

581
00:35:18,643 --> 00:35:22,265
[SPEAKER_02]: They're on the PC, and they were on, you know, the PlayStation stuff, you can make your own games?

582
00:35:22,365 --> 00:35:22,885
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, sure.

583
00:35:22,965 --> 00:35:23,966
[SPEAKER_02]: One's coming to the DS.

584
00:35:25,006 --> 00:35:26,307
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a legit game?

585
00:35:26,587 --> 00:35:27,007
[SPEAKER_02]: Legit.

586
00:35:27,247 --> 00:35:27,567
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

587
00:35:27,868 --> 00:35:28,408
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's putting it out?

588
00:35:28,428 --> 00:35:28,768
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you remember?

589
00:35:29,268 --> 00:35:32,470
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe it's... Oh, God, I can't remember who the original company was.

590
00:35:33,491 --> 00:35:34,251
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the same company.

591
00:35:34,271 --> 00:35:34,471
[SPEAKER_02]: AgeTech.

592
00:35:34,531 --> 00:35:37,893
[SPEAKER_01]: AgeTech's doing RPG Maker 3.

593
00:35:37,933 --> 00:35:40,714
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to see RPG Maker 3 at their booth at E3.

594
00:35:40,734 --> 00:35:41,355
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let me see here.

595
00:35:41,475 --> 00:35:42,615
[SPEAKER_02]: It says right on it.

596
00:35:43,196 --> 00:35:45,517
[SPEAKER_02]: It is... How was it at E3?

597
00:35:46,417 --> 00:35:46,978
[SPEAKER_01]: It was pretty good.

598
00:35:47,018 --> 00:35:48,138
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't get to see a whole bunch of it.

599
00:35:49,179 --> 00:35:50,520
[SPEAKER_01]: They were more focusing on Front Mission.

600
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:51,280
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

601
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:53,711
[SPEAKER_02]: It does not say who's putting it out.

602
00:35:53,851 --> 00:35:54,751
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, isn't that a Square game?

603
00:35:55,071 --> 00:35:55,711
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not Front Mission.

604
00:35:57,592 --> 00:35:57,992
[SPEAKER_01]: The other one.

605
00:35:58,332 --> 00:36:06,294
[SPEAKER_02]: But apparently, I guess with this game maker, you can actually make games from a multiplayer game to 3D games.

606
00:36:06,575 --> 00:36:08,555
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is not just an RPG maker.

607
00:36:08,895 --> 00:36:10,516
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, White DS is coming out soon.

608
00:36:11,076 --> 00:36:11,456
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoop-de-doo.

609
00:36:12,438 --> 00:36:21,420
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, we here at Orange Launch Radio, we're not just about talking about video games all the time, because if we talked about video games all the time, we would have no time to go out and eat tacos.

610
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:30,882
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are here to better your life, and what better way to better your life than DarkSakura giving you a little piece of her advice with her advice column.

611
00:36:31,342 --> 00:36:33,362
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, what are you going to talk to us about tonight?

612
00:36:35,343 --> 00:36:40,104
[SPEAKER_01]: Today's life lesson, bit of advice, call it what you will.

613
00:36:40,996 --> 00:36:42,777
[SPEAKER_01]: is how to perform a tracheotomy.

614
00:36:43,977 --> 00:36:46,498
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you never know when you have to give someone a tracheotomy.

615
00:36:47,898 --> 00:36:51,879
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one, find the person's Adam's apple thyroid, that's the thyroid cartilage.

616
00:36:52,600 --> 00:37:00,042
[SPEAKER_01]: Move your finger about one inch down the neck until you feel another bulge, the cricoid cartilage, I guess that's how it's pronounced.

617
00:37:00,102 --> 00:37:01,422
[SPEAKER_01]: It's C-R-I-C-O-I-D.

618
00:37:02,202 --> 00:37:09,265
[SPEAKER_01]: The indentation between the two is the cricothyroid membrane where the incision will be made.

619
00:37:11,155 --> 00:37:16,517
[SPEAKER_01]: Using a razor blade or knife, make a horizontal incision about half an inch across and half an inch deep.

620
00:37:17,377 --> 00:37:16,517
3.

621
00:37:17,937 --> 00:37:21,138
[SPEAKER_01]: Pinch the incision open or place your finger inside it to slit it open.

622
00:37:21,158 --> 00:37:21,138
4.

623
00:37:22,899 --> 00:37:26,380
[SPEAKER_01]: Insert a tube in the incision roughly and half inch to one inch deep.

624
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:26,380
5.

625
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:29,561
[SPEAKER_01]: Breathe into the tube with two quick breaths.

626
00:37:32,126 --> 00:37:38,030
[SPEAKER_01]: You will see the chest rise and the person should regain consciousness if you have performed the procedure correctly.

627
00:37:38,531 --> 00:37:41,333
[SPEAKER_01]: However, if you have performed it incorrectly, they will bleed to death.

628
00:37:43,894 --> 00:37:45,215
[SPEAKER_03]: Any final pieces of advice?

629
00:37:45,876 --> 00:37:50,419
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, just don't go hanging out on the smoking porch when people are about to choke to death.

630
00:37:51,279 --> 00:37:53,561
[SPEAKER_02]: Always check and see if there's a doctor nearby first.

631
00:37:54,061 --> 00:37:57,584
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I learned something because I once saw this on a TV show.

632
00:37:57,644 --> 00:37:59,385
[SPEAKER_03]: All they did was jam a big pen in there.

633
00:38:00,738 --> 00:38:01,198
[SPEAKER_03]: Big Pens.

634
00:38:01,578 --> 00:38:01,798
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

635
00:38:02,358 --> 00:38:03,259
[SPEAKER_03]: Emergency tracheotomy.

636
00:38:05,319 --> 00:38:09,000
[SPEAKER_01]: I was wondering though, a woman doesn't have an Adam's apple.

637
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:19,182
[SPEAKER_01]: I did this try to feel, and see, I have this thing about my neck where if I touch my neck, if anything touches my neck, I get nauseous.

638
00:38:20,062 --> 00:38:25,663
[SPEAKER_01]: But I had to find, and I think I found the spot for a woman.

639
00:38:25,723 --> 00:38:28,084
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about maybe two-thirds down.

640
00:38:28,484 --> 00:38:29,064
[SPEAKER_03]: Eve's apple.

641
00:38:30,393 --> 00:38:34,356
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, anyway, this is kind of interesting.

642
00:38:36,177 --> 00:38:46,005
[SPEAKER_03]: Rumors going around the internet that Rare, which by the way is now like a Microsoft subsidiary, they're looking at developing Nintendo DS games, which makes a lot of people go, huh?

643
00:38:46,766 --> 00:38:56,173
[SPEAKER_03]: But sure enough, on their website, they're looking for experienced 3D artists for Nintendo DS and games programmers for the Nintendo DS.

644
00:38:57,387 --> 00:38:59,369
[SPEAKER_03]: And this just kind of makes us go, huh?

645
00:38:59,989 --> 00:39:01,730
[SPEAKER_03]: Is Microsoft going to do something with the DS?

646
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:03,772
[SPEAKER_01]: Killer Instinct 3 on the DS!

647
00:39:05,513 --> 00:39:06,754
[SPEAKER_03]: That would make me happy, actually.

648
00:39:06,854 --> 00:39:14,099
[SPEAKER_03]: If Microsoft has no plans to enter the handheld market, I could see where this is just, hey, why not make money off someone else's console?

649
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,562
[SPEAKER_03]: Assuming, again, that Microsoft has no plans to enter the market.

650
00:39:18,902 --> 00:39:22,805
[SPEAKER_03]: But of course, have you heard those rumors about the Xbox 360 is supposed to interact with the DS?

651
00:39:22,885 --> 00:39:23,305
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, what?

652
00:39:23,365 --> 00:39:23,666
[SPEAKER_01]: And PSP.

653
00:39:23,706 --> 00:39:23,926
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

654
00:39:25,201 --> 00:39:27,123
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, and all it is is a docking station.

655
00:39:28,384 --> 00:39:30,865
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to the Xbox 360 demo thing.

656
00:39:31,346 --> 00:39:40,012
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a docking station for the 360 that is basically any USB device or any type of device with transfer capability.

657
00:39:40,936 --> 00:39:45,037
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a docking station to connect to MP3 players like the iPod or the iRiver.

658
00:39:45,718 --> 00:39:58,202
[SPEAKER_01]: MP3, they have for mini disc players, for all kinds of variety, for digital cameras, scanners.

659
00:39:58,982 --> 00:40:06,865
[SPEAKER_01]: They basically are having a docking station to go with the 360 that's going to interface with basically any kind of digital media device.

660
00:40:07,817 --> 00:40:16,244
[SPEAKER_02]: What I heard was they're going to be using the Xbox 360 as basically you can use the PSP and the DS to play games over the internet.

661
00:40:16,324 --> 00:40:18,266
[SPEAKER_02]: Microsoft games over the internet.

662
00:40:18,306 --> 00:40:18,706
[SPEAKER_02]: Weird.

663
00:40:18,746 --> 00:40:24,411
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically what I'm thinking is it'll basically use those two devices as a Bluetooth controller.

664
00:40:25,772 --> 00:40:28,414
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't believe it until I see it, honestly.

665
00:40:28,494 --> 00:40:28,935
[SPEAKER_01]: I doubt it.

666
00:40:29,235 --> 00:40:29,495
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.

667
00:40:30,356 --> 00:40:36,501
[SPEAKER_01]: At the demo thing that I went to, they were doing, you know how they do little stylish outlines of different things and showing what?

668
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:38,440
[SPEAKER_01]: They had a freaking outline of a PSP up there.

669
00:40:39,041 --> 00:40:39,741
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of weird.

670
00:40:39,941 --> 00:40:40,341
[SPEAKER_03]: That's weird.

671
00:40:41,041 --> 00:40:41,781
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well, we'll see.

672
00:40:43,742 --> 00:40:44,222
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on.

673
00:40:44,262 --> 00:40:49,884
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a story that's kind of been making that rounds on the web forums and being passed around via various emails.

674
00:40:49,924 --> 00:40:50,304
[SPEAKER_03]: Get this.

675
00:40:50,804 --> 00:40:58,986
[SPEAKER_03]: An 11-year-old boy stabbed his baby nephew in the stomach after the infant's crying disrupted his PlayStation game.

676
00:41:00,748 --> 00:41:05,272
[SPEAKER_03]: The PlayStation game in question had something to do with the Incredibles, basically, some type of port of the Incredibles.

677
00:41:06,173 --> 00:41:17,664
[SPEAKER_03]: And the boy told police that in the minutes before the incident, he kept losing while he was playing the game, and then the crying made him feel like an erupted volcano.

678
00:41:18,621 --> 00:41:20,802
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds like this kid's got anger management issues.

679
00:41:21,442 --> 00:41:22,342
[SPEAKER_03]: But what do you think?

680
00:41:22,363 --> 00:41:23,863
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll try to pin this on the game anyway.

681
00:41:23,963 --> 00:41:24,443
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think so.

682
00:41:24,563 --> 00:41:26,084
[SPEAKER_01]: No, because it's Disney.

683
00:41:26,384 --> 00:41:29,065
[SPEAKER_01]: Or was it Pixar?

684
00:41:29,205 --> 00:41:31,946
[SPEAKER_02]: If it were Grand Theft Auto, oh yeah.

685
00:41:32,527 --> 00:41:33,627
[SPEAKER_02]: Rockstar's getting a call.

686
00:41:34,187 --> 00:41:35,908
[SPEAKER_01]: And on top of that, this and this in the UK.

687
00:41:38,365 --> 00:41:43,528
[SPEAKER_03]: The news story I'm getting is from the UK, but I actually... No, I caught his slang.

688
00:41:44,369 --> 00:41:47,591
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to say, I thought it was actually in Florida or something.

689
00:41:47,631 --> 00:41:48,232
[SPEAKER_01]: In Florida?

690
00:41:48,472 --> 00:41:49,372
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a location listed?

691
00:41:49,973 --> 00:41:55,757
[SPEAKER_01]: No, because they went to the Diana Princess of Wales hospital.

692
00:41:57,078 --> 00:41:57,258
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

693
00:41:58,447 --> 00:41:59,507
[SPEAKER_03]: Which I don't think there's one in Florida.

694
00:41:59,708 --> 00:42:02,429
[SPEAKER_03]: Whole Crown Court, yeah, I guess it was in the UK.

695
00:42:02,569 --> 00:42:03,009
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

696
00:42:03,029 --> 00:42:04,970
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought this happened in the US.

697
00:42:05,010 --> 00:42:05,950
[SPEAKER_03]: It could have happened in the US.

698
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:07,851
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that kind of reaction would happen there.

699
00:42:09,312 --> 00:42:12,333
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, honestly, Americans are a lot more freaking hysterical.

700
00:42:13,413 --> 00:42:17,195
[SPEAKER_03]: True, but you know somebody's going to try and pin this on the games.

701
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:20,360
[SPEAKER_03]: because video games are evil.

702
00:42:21,341 --> 00:42:24,023
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that that's the same mindset there that it is here.

703
00:42:24,744 --> 00:42:28,647
[SPEAKER_01]: I would actually really love to hear from any of our UK listeners.

704
00:42:30,468 --> 00:42:38,554
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's any type of flashback, anything that's been in the news or anything, I would seriously like to know because I would love to compare the difference in reaction.

705
00:42:39,289 --> 00:42:40,990
[SPEAKER_01]: That would just amuse me to no end.

706
00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:44,753
[SPEAKER_03]: Togo, T-O-G-O, at OrangeLawnTrader.com if you want to send us one of those emails.

707
00:42:45,533 --> 00:42:46,834
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on, trying to wrap it up here.

708
00:42:47,254 --> 00:42:50,797
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful Joe was going to be called Beautiful Joe VFX Battle.

709
00:42:51,017 --> 00:42:53,738
[SPEAKER_03]: They're changing the name to Beautiful Joe Battle Carnival.

710
00:42:54,759 --> 00:42:57,341
[SPEAKER_03]: GameCube game coming out September 29th.

711
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:59,862
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes me think too much of Carnival.

712
00:43:00,663 --> 00:43:01,203
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

713
00:43:01,283 --> 00:43:02,904
[SPEAKER_03]: Battle Carnival is a little interesting.

714
00:43:02,924 --> 00:43:03,665
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a cool name, though.

715
00:43:03,985 --> 00:43:04,325
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

716
00:43:05,146 --> 00:43:05,406
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

717
00:43:06,671 --> 00:43:09,853
[SPEAKER_03]: And last but not least tonight, the guy game.

718
00:43:09,973 --> 00:43:10,794
[SPEAKER_03]: You remember this game?

719
00:43:10,874 --> 00:43:16,037
[SPEAKER_03]: They got a little bit busted early on because one of the chicks in it was not 18.

720
00:43:17,958 --> 00:43:24,843
[SPEAKER_03]: The guy game was banned, which I was surprised to see that the story had kind of hit...

721
00:43:26,643 --> 00:43:29,927
[SPEAKER_03]: This week, because I thought the thing got banned months ago when this first came out.

722
00:43:30,007 --> 00:43:32,609
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the PC version came out and it was on shelves.

723
00:43:32,769 --> 00:43:38,235
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically what it is, is that the temporary holding that was on the game became permanent.

724
00:43:38,755 --> 00:43:42,379
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Guy Games website does confirm this.

725
00:43:42,987 --> 00:43:43,528
[SPEAKER_03]: Just so you know.

726
00:43:44,028 --> 00:43:47,491
[SPEAKER_01]: If you get a copy, wait a couple weeks, slap that mother on eBay.

727
00:43:47,872 --> 00:43:48,632
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, here's the thing.

728
00:43:49,133 --> 00:43:54,718
[SPEAKER_03]: Now what they're going to do is they're going to put it all on a DVD called The Guy Game, Game Over, and sell it for $19.99.

729
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:59,803
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably, I would guess, without the 17-year-old in question.

730
00:43:59,883 --> 00:44:02,445
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll just trim her on out of there and have a new DVD.

731
00:44:04,727 --> 00:44:05,367
[SPEAKER_03]: So there you have it.

732
00:44:05,447 --> 00:44:07,889
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, interested in that purchase at all?

733
00:44:07,929 --> 00:44:08,909
[SPEAKER_02]: I already have the guy game.

734
00:44:10,090 --> 00:44:18,894
[SPEAKER_02]: What's interesting though is that actually Girls Gone Wild is doing this new thing called Girls Gone Wild games.

735
00:44:19,874 --> 00:44:20,835
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's actually...

736
00:44:21,326 --> 00:44:25,447
[SPEAKER_02]: The little mini... Not really the mini games, but if you... Rob played the guy game.

737
00:44:25,707 --> 00:44:29,328
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember at the very end of the guy game, they had the guy game challenge or whatever?

738
00:44:30,088 --> 00:44:34,289
[SPEAKER_02]: And where the women would do, like, they'd bounce on the ball or they would jump.

739
00:44:34,469 --> 00:44:35,469
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all that.

740
00:44:35,990 --> 00:44:39,410
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and they got, like, a minute bonus if they did it topless and things like that?

741
00:44:39,430 --> 00:44:39,911
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.

742
00:44:39,931 --> 00:44:40,951
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all that crap.

743
00:44:41,911 --> 00:44:43,691
[SPEAKER_02]: So, apparently, this will be popular.

744
00:44:44,432 --> 00:44:48,773
[SPEAKER_02]: How much you wanna bet that, you know, that Girls Gone Wild will put out a trivia game just like this?

745
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:49,813
[SPEAKER_02]: One of these days.

746
00:44:51,112 --> 00:44:52,233
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gonna happen.

747
00:44:52,273 --> 00:44:52,994
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gonna happen.

748
00:44:53,834 --> 00:44:57,297
[SPEAKER_02]: And honestly, I think the guy game, they should do another one.

749
00:44:58,097 --> 00:45:01,080
[SPEAKER_02]: ID him first.

750
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:01,880
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

751
00:45:02,861 --> 00:45:05,843
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, that's gonna do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio To Go.

752
00:45:06,184 --> 00:45:07,204
[SPEAKER_03]: Final thoughts, Loki?

753
00:45:07,885 --> 00:45:11,168
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna play me some Killer7 and hopefully finish this game.

754
00:45:12,629 --> 00:45:16,892
[SPEAKER_03]: My final thought is rubbing together, oil, Dark Sakura.

755
00:45:17,312 --> 00:45:19,354
[SPEAKER_01]: We need the girl game with like

756
00:45:20,454 --> 00:45:23,596
[SPEAKER_01]: and then the special Yaoi edition.

757
00:45:26,497 --> 00:45:27,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead.

758
00:45:27,277 --> 00:45:27,957
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you first.

759
00:45:28,218 --> 00:45:31,419
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say, by the way, there's a new Guys Gone Wild DVD coming out.

760
00:45:32,299 --> 00:45:32,780
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay!

761
00:45:35,461 --> 00:45:39,362
[SPEAKER_01]: But my absolute final thought is reject bus icons!

762
00:45:41,003 --> 00:45:41,683
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to do it.

763
00:45:41,703 --> 00:45:42,764
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see you next time here.
