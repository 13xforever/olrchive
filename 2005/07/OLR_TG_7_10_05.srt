14
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:58,380
and in that corner over there, the one and only, Loki.

15
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:01,320
Yes, I am here and I'm sober this time.

16
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,180
Yes you are.

17
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:03,820
How you feeling after last week's show?

18
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:04,660
I feel fine.

19
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:08,020
You know, after, really the next day I woke up,

20
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:09,740
I did not remember the podcast.

21
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:11,980
I remember doing a podcast, but I didn't remember

22
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:13,980
anything from the beginning to the end,

23
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:15,980
so I actually had to listen to the podcast

24
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:18,820
to figure out what I said, and what I said

25
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,380
was basically a lot of rambling.

26
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:24,340
But when I wasn't repeating myself three times in a row,

27
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:25,260
I was pretty.

28
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,260
But you always ramble.

29
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:29,100
But it was like more so.

30
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,100
It was pretty bad.

31
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,100
Alright.

32
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,100
You were very random and it was hilarious.

33
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:36,420
We got some concerned emails so I just want our listeners to know he's okay.

34
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:37,420
I'm okay.

35
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:41,940
Well what happened was I drank a little bit more than I thought I actually had been drinking

36
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:45,960
because the shot glass I was using for my screwdrivers, which is the drink of my choice

37
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,100
that night, was a double shot shot glass.

38
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:53,860
So I thought I was putting two shots in each one but I was actually doing four each one

39
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:59,340
And next thing you know, I did 20 and drank the whole bottle of vodka and I was gone.

40
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:04,340
Lesson learned, boys and girls, if you're drinking by yourself, if you're the only one drinking out of a bottle of vodka,

41
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:08,620
and it's like halfway gone, it might be time to quit. Don't go the whole way, like Loki did.

42
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:12,540
Oh well, lessons learned, it's a good thing you didn't end up going to the hospital, young man.

43
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:16,820
Seriously, I was thinking that you might have had, like, alcohol poisoning.

44
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:19,500
Well, he did to some extent, because that's what causes you to go black.

45
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,940
Well, yeah, but I mean...

46
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:21,660
Anyway...

47
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:22,660
Let's move on to the games.

48
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,860
Like that chick on the real world.

49
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:25,860
I don't watch crap.

50
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:26,860
Come on.

51
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:29,340
This is a long time ago and I caught the first episode by accident.

52
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,420
I thought you didn't watch TV.

53
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:31,860
This is a shocker to me.

54
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,100
This is a long time ago.

55
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,100
Okay, okay.

56
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,100
And MTV nonetheless.

57
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,100
No, I know.

58
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,100
I understand.

59
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,220
Alright, let's talk about the games.

60
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,140
We'll get into some gaming news and a lot of your emails.

61
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,620
We got a lot of great emails last week.

62
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:46,140
We're going to get to those, but first we always like to let you guys know what we're

63
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,140
up to.

64
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,140
What's going on in our gaming world.

65
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:51,380
So, Dark Sakura, any games new and exciting for you?

66
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,020
I haven't had time to play Cryout.

67
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:55,660
Been too busy getting the house in order.

68
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:57,540
How very domestic.

69
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,380
I've been playing by the washer and dryer in a refrigerator

70
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,340
game.

71
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:04,060
You need to get a Game Boy or something to play.

72
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:07,020
I know you probably have like a Game Boy, a Wonder Swan.

73
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,020
They're in boxes.

74
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:08,540
I see.

75
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:09,700
OK.

76
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,500
But we did buy a 50-inch widescreen HDTV.

77
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:12,980
I remember.

78
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:14,580
You briefly touched on that last one.

79
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,500
And this is sexy.

80
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,820
How do the games look on it?

81
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,580
We haven't looked anything up yet.

82
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:20,820
They're in boxes.

83
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,940
Where are your priorities?

84
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:24,760
My priorities have been

85
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,320
you know, going to work

86
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:30,780
and buying a washer and dryer so that I don't have dirty clothes.

87
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,000
Fine.

88
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,900
And a refrigerator so that I have food that doesn't go bad.

89
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,360
That I can't eat any of.

90
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,620
Fine, fine.

91
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:42,620
Gamers gotta have priorities too. Let's find out then what Loki's been up to. What have you been up to, Loki?

92
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:45,140
I've been playing a lot of stuff actually.

93
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:49,500
The first game I started off with this week was Mercury for the PSP

94
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,940
and I'm happy to say it sucked ass. Really?

95
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:57,940
and it was a complete disappointment it's not what you think it's a very it's a

96
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:58,780
puzzle game

97
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:02,820
but it I was bored it was just a completely retarded and I was

98
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:06,260
I was just thank God you know I was borrowing it not

99
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:11,260
buying it so. That's two puzzlers now on PSP you haven't liked. And the same thing

100
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:14,820
lots a load time also it's like what the hell's wrong with these people

101
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:19,860
but it sucks so don't buy it. Then I played Coded Arms

102
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:22,900
for the PSP, the PSP's first

103
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:27,100
first-person shooter and it's awesome. It's really awesome.

104
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,500
The controls, they tried to do the best they could at the PSP

105
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,900
being that it only has one analog six so the other, you know,

106
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:37,260
looking around is used with the four buttons which isn't

107
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:41,820
isn't quite good. It's not as smooth as I would have liked it to have been

108
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:46,400
But you know, it's the best they can really do for the PSP. So they made the best of it

109
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:51,320
But other than that, it's okay. I wish there was another analog stick on the PSP then it isn't perfect

110
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,960
What what makes it so great then since you're only complaining about the just the graphics are really good

111
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,600
The games just put together really well

112
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:02,360
It just surprised me on how well the graphics were and just really it looks like a lot of fun actually

113
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:09,640
actually. The other game I played was Puzzle Bobble for the PSP, which is a Japanese import,

114
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:15,520
not telling you how I got that one, and it, just like Puzzle Bobble, nothing, no surprise

115
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,800
there. It's every system's mandatory Puzzle Bobble release in one way or another. It's

116
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,720
good, it's good. I know Dark Soccer's gonna yell at me for this, but a lot of you folks

117
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:30,260
know it as Bust-A-Move. Puzzle Bobble. Anyways, I'm just saying, the American name was Bust-A-Move

118
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:33,480
despite how you feel about Bust-A-Groove and all that stuff.

119
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:39,880
Now, moving away from the handheld systems, I bought Killer7, and it's great, it's just

120
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,440
a very psychotic game.

121
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,380
The storyline, the game seems very anime-like to me, just the whole...

122
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,380
What's the setup?

123
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,380
What's the story setup?

124
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:51,000
The setup basically is, I mean, they don't really tell you much in the beginning.

125
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,720
You're this group of assassins, basically this guy, Harman Smith, he's this wheelchair-bound

126
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:59,680
assassin who has seven different multiple personalities

127
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,600
among this and it's all in this one group and they each have these really

128
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,320
extraordinary powers and stuff and you can actually

129
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,840
you know he can put them into the physical forms so to speak

130
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,440
but there's you know you're not really sure if

131
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,000
you know he's in the if it's in the physical form or not and what they make

132
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,320
you

133
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:21,520
and what they kind of lead you to believe is that you yourself

134
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,280
the player are another one of his personalities which is great

135
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:30,960
Um, so that was really neat and it's just it the storyline is very rich and just like full of

136
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:36,480
I don't know a lot of detail and stuff and I've only played you know to the second level so far and

137
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,600
There's a lot of really crazy shit in there. I mean like they're laughing the main

138
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:46,480
Villain of or the enemies that you encounter called these things called heaven smile

139
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:50,360
They look like these zombies and they have these giant giant like

140
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:55,720
grins on them and they just go ha ha ha and they laugh and it's like that weird

141
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:00,520
it's like a weird laugh and then they've got like you shoot them and you collect

142
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:04,920
the blood from them and you use the blood to up to you know like that one

143
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:09,760
game nanobreaker sort of oil sorry sort of but this is actually blood and I mean

144
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:14,480
it's just it's really strange the whole game is very psychographical look

145
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:18,720
because I know it's good it's all cel-shaded but it's done really well

146
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:24,780
well then the cutscenes are an anime or actual anime and it's really interesting. They give

147
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:28,240
you a lot of background about the characters and stuff but the whole game I still don't

148
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,720
really know what's going on yet and that's the whole point is you feel psychotic playing

149
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,560
this game. So do you recommend this one? Oh yeah, it's a very different game. It's got

150
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:42,480
a storyline that's about as deep as Silent Hill and it plays, to me, I mean everyone

151
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:47,120
is knocking the rail system where you're running around limited movement but it plays to me

152
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:53,040
Sort of like a lot of dark. There's puzzle solving and stuff like that speaking it speaking of Silent Hill since you brought it up

153
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,740
I have to put this in real fast. I've been following what's going on with the movie

154
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:59,160
They're putting pyramid head from Silent Hill 2 is gonna be in the movie

155
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,640
And this is just gonna let you know, oh my gosh

156
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:08,600
We might get a video game movie done right in every way a Kiriyama Oka is producing the soundtrack

157
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:13,620
I know and a Kiriyama Oka actually did the music with the Silent Hills, so they're not

158
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:17,220
violating that I'm like I was going to have a problem with Silent Hill of the

159
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:20,740
Kiryamoka because half of Silent Hill is the mood of the music and everything so

160
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:25,020
I'm just very excited for this video that's very exciting the music and mood

161
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:29,460
of this game is really weird too it's just it's really you've got to play

162
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:34,740
killer 7 at least Ren at once it's just so strange it's just you've got to play

163
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:38,900
we got we got to figure out a way to get advanced screening or media aren't we

164
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,700
We can get advanced screening soon.

165
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,700
I need to see this.

166
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:48,580
Dear Yamaoka-san, Daisuke, Daisuke, Daisuke.

167
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:49,540
So yeah.

168
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,780
Pre-release on a night.

169
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,060
We are not above groveling.

170
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:53,740
I'm sorry, Loki.

171
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:57,180
Other than that, I won a free PSP.

172
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:00,020
And I ended up selling it for about $150.

173
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:02,580
But I sold it to someone that's in our company.

174
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,820
And I'm also going to get the hookup from them.

175
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,820
They're going to give me a copy as soon as they

176
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,380
get it of Advent Children.

177
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:14,540
maybe a UMD. Nice, okay. So I had to knock the price down for them.

178
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:19,340
So that's pretty much all I've been doing. Killer7 is awesome and I'm going to play all the way through it.

179
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,740
Destroy All Humans, I've already beat it. It was fun.

180
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:26,980
How was, without giving away the ending, were you, I heard rumors that the ending was a bit of a letdown.

181
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:33,380
It's your typical ending for a game. It wasn't like, there really, there's not high expectations.

182
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:38,220
The end of the game you have like two boss fights and that's kind of weird because there's no boss fights throughout the whole game.

183
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,640
and then you fight these two bosses and it's like

184
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:45,340
okay this is there's a little bit stronger than they should be but this is

185
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:49,180
retarded but the whole point of the game is that you've got the same guide does

186
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:52,860
the new voice acting for zim and he's in it and it's great that's why I love it

187
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,540
well good now that you're done with it I can borrow it that's the important thing

188
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:58,140
no you can't because you don't have a US PlayStation 2

189
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:01,980
I will very soon I'm working on that because I'm sick of having only a

190
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,660
Japanese one although I'll tell you what

191
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:07,760
if I had a Japanese PlayStation or if I had the drive I do have a

192
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,960
Japanese PlayStation 2, if I had the money to import,

193
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,200
I would have imported We Heart Katamari this week.

194
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,400
It was released in Japan.

195
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,240
It's awesome.

196
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,680
I actually want to play little bits from the soundtrack

197
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,200
for you guys.

198
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,280
Just little, little snippets, because playing music

199
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,720
in podcasts is questionable.

200
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,720
But I don't think they'll mind the free plug if we just

201
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,920
play a little snippet here from the soundtrack.

202
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,360
So what I want to play for you guys is a little snippet.

203
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,280
First off, you have to hear this.

204
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,040
This is great.

205
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,300
This is the training music in the new We Heart Katamari.

206
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,580
It's like beatboxing.

207
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,100
It's this Japanese beatbox guy.

208
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,060
Listen to this.

209
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:45,980
["WE HEART KATAMARI"]

210
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,500
What do you expect?

211
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,840
It's the kind of thing you'd expect from the sequel

212
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,820
to Katamari Damacy.

213
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,500
So I'm not disappointed at all.

214
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:08,160
I love the game, just the premise of the game. It's basically the prince of the cosmos or

215
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:14,360
whatever. He's doing stuff for the fans of the previous game. That's the story of the

216
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,360
game.

217
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,360
That's cute!

218
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:26,120
Here's another one. This is a quick snippet from the introduction of the game.

219
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:35,040
katamari damacy the Broadway show it's like some sicko twist between Avenue Q

220
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,280
and rent all of a sudden or something I don't know anyway so that's that's

221
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:43,100
definitely looking good so as far as the games that I have been playing this week

222
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,320
you know I didn't have a whole lot because I've still been addicted to

223
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,840
medios I've been playing that an awful awful lot an unhealthy amount I'm loving

224
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:53,440
that game but I knew that I had to go play something new so I actually went

225
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,100
And I looked on I'm like okay. What are all the cool kids playing this week, and you know I'm out there

226
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:03,660
Just reading what's going on a message boards and hearing what all the talks about and everybody's talking about Battlefield 2, so I said okay

227
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:07,260
I'm gonna go download the demo for Battlefield 2 now keep in mind

228
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:10,140
I don't really play these types of games a whole lot

229
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:15,220
It's it's basically you know another kind of war sim game, but it's also got first-person shooter elements

230
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:15,880
And I'm kind of like okay

231
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,740
I can dig some of the first-person shooters

232
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:20,240
You know I got into Doom 3 and Halo and all that stuff the big ones

233
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,020
So I decided to get battlefield to a try and you know what guys I just have to say

234
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:30,260
I'm sure the game is great if you're into that kind of thing because it's definitely a pretty looking game and a lot of the

235
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:31,460
Elements in it are very cool

236
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:35,560
Like they have like the voting with page up and down and just the aspect of it

237
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,080
The setup is really good, but honestly me personally

238
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,080
I just couldn't get into it like it was seriously one of those things

239
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:45,020
I'm just like I really want to like this game, but it's just not my thing. I can't get into this

240
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:49,600
It's my feeble brain cannot handle this game for some reason because I kept shooting my own guys

241
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,880
like I just I don't know I just didn't get it one more deal bad one more

242
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:57,880
addition to the killer seven thing just to tell you how how crazy it is you talk

243
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:01,800
to a severed head a lot of time it has nothing to do on time you're done you're

244
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:07,200
done but battlefield 2 my only disappointment with it I'm sure it's a

245
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,580
fun game if you're into the games and it would be a great party game I got I got

246
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:14,400
to try that still I'm not gonna give a final verdict on the game until I can

247
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,800
really play it with some other live people except I don't know who in their

248
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,200
right mind would want to play that game with me because I'm awful at it but my

249
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:24,120
only disappointment is that I actually expected the graphics to be even was

250
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:27,560
considering the system requirements for that game oh my gosh it's like you have

251
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:33,120
to have a 1.7 gig machine and all this stuff crazy high-end video card luckily

252
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:38,040
I have a lot of that stuff but I would I was kind of expecting the game to look

253
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,960
better maybe I just didn't get far enough in it though so I'm kind of I'm

254
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:44,600
not gonna dog on it for the graphics I mean it is a nice looking game it's just

255
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:48,140
I would have expected it to be the best darn thing I've ever seen considering the

256
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:54,080
Technical requirements. So that's my half-assed review of battlefield 2. Sorry. I tried for you guys

257
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:59,080
I tried to play a war sim game and get into it. Just just couldn't do it. I'll stick with that

258
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:08,060
Techie what was that game? I can't remember the English name of it now with the huge

259
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:17,380
controller that I got Dan. Oh, the mech warrior? Yeah. Mech assault. No, that controller didn't

260
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:23,700
go to mech assault. It was Steel Battalion. Oh, that's it. I'll stick with Steel Battalion

261
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:28,940
because it has an eject button. The eject button was cool. Did you have something? I

262
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:32,100
know you were trying to interject something earlier and I was... Yeah, I went back to

263
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:38,220
the we bought up Silent Hill I went back to the movie stuff I am DB has a bigger

264
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:41,720
list of characters now and Dahlia Gillespie and Alyssa Gillespie are both

265
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:46,540
in it oh for anyone who played the game those are like the two that the whole

266
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:50,260
thing was centered around Wow that's so yeah we are sticking with storylines

267
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:53,540
we're getting that and pyramid head though that's gonna yeah that should be

268
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:57,160
interesting to see how they bring it there's an officer Gucci and someone

269
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:01,180
named Sharon and a bunch of the only actors in here really heard of a Sean

270
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:05,500
Bean which is pretty cool cuz he can be wicked mm-hmm all right so more to come

271
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,140
on the Silent Hill movie as we get it let's get into some other gaming news

272
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:12,700
first off I think this is very interesting the makers of Grand Theft

273
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:18,460
Auto San Andreas Rockstar games is being held under the microscope right now by

274
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:22,780
the ESRB and what this whole thing centers around is basically the sex mod

275
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:25,340
which some of you guys I think we've talked about it on this show previously

276
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:30,100
Loki you're that hack crack guy tell us about set up the sex mod how does this

277
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:35,700
Okay, basically there's unfinished code that's in the game, or basically locked out code,

278
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:39,420
and you know, people being the hackers that they are looking through the code, they found

279
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:41,660
it, and so they enable it back in the game.

280
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:48,100
Much like how with Grand Theft Auto, or not Sandra, Vice City and stuff, they're working

281
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:55,060
on multi-theft auto, which is using the multiplayer code that was in there to play online.

282
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:59,380
But this one is basically, I guess you can go and have actual sex, and there's a sex

283
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:06,060
minigame in Grand Theft Auto that's hidden away in the code on PC, and people have unlocked

284
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:11,540
it with this mod called the Hot Coffee mod, because you go in for coffee in a normal game.

285
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:15,620
So yeah, that's what the whole fuss is about, and apparently it is very graphic from the

286
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,620
video that I've seen.

287
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:17,620
I haven't done that yet.

288
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:21,900
Wait, DarkSakura, you found a site with pictures and stuff, what did you find out about this?

289
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:24,900
I actually closed it.

290
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:31,000
It was, yeah, it just had like three positions and showed pictures of them all, but it also

291
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:37,240
gave a link to the site how to get to said mod, and give me a second, I'll get it up

292
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,240
again.

293
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:44,500
Yeah, basically you can download it on the major mod, Grand Theft Auto mod sites, and

294
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:52,300
it starts off, where are you going, for coffee, and then the woman orally pleasures you.

295
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,520
We get it, we get it, we get it.

296
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,520
It's very graphic.

297
00:16:55,520 --> 00:17:00,600
It's like, hmm, well yeah, that would be pushing the envelope there, wouldn't it?

298
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:11,200
Where I found the pictures was on UKResistance.co.uk for the June 2005 news.

299
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:15,640
You know, and the ESRB is now kind of looking going, you know, should this be an adults-only

300
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,640
game?

301
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:22,940
Because the California Assemblyman Leland Yee is saying that this, basically he's kind

302
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:27,140
of pushing behind this too that the game should be rated adults only, and the ESRB needs to

303
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:33,460
take another look at this, but what the ESRB has to look at is, did Rockstar sneak this

304
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,460
by?

305
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,860
Were they intending this to be a part of the game?

306
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:41,540
And I say, if you had to mod or crack the game, no, it's unfinished stuff.

307
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:45,280
It's just like how there was a skateboard weapon, and people have unlocked the skateboard

308
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,280
weapon.

309
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:50,780
It's code that was in there that's unfinished, and they took it out, and it's the same thing.

310
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:56,420
Like I brought up on our live show, you know, there was Bloody War 3, all the little pictures

311
00:17:56,420 --> 00:18:02,620
hidden in the game, that if you put in the debug code by using a GameShark or Game Genie,

312
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:05,260
lo and behold.

313
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:09,300
And as one of you guys brought up on the live show as well, the nude patch for The Sims,

314
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:12,940
E8 didn't get sued over that because that was something that was out of their control.

315
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:13,940
Exactly.

316
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:14,940
Exactly.

317
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:19,900
I mean, even though they accidentally left the code in the game, that doesn't mean that

318
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:24,400
intended for people to hack the game and unlock it, they're violating the license agreement

319
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,400
by doing that, right?

320
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,880
When you open the box, you're sending a license agreement.

321
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,400
Or the gay sex ending for Simcopter.

322
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,560
What?

323
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:33,040
There was a gay sex ending for Simcopter.

324
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,600
How have I not heard of this?

325
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,760
This is a long time ago, I remember seeing something about this.

326
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:42,320
Well, in Simcopter, the graphics weren't that great, but it was a bunch of stick figures,

327
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:48,480
guys, you know, having anal sex, and I kid you not, it was in the game.

328
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,760
It was an easter egg that some developer hit in there. It's like what the hell?

329
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:59,260
But it was in there in that context the term easter egg is like ten times funnier. I'm sorry all right

330
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:06,340
It's weird okay anyway, so quick. It's like a quick poll is anything gonna happen to rockstar because of this I say no

331
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:11,280
All the only thing you know the only thing all happens their game will sell more because people want to you know

332
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:18,400
I want to play a game with simulated boobies as I also suggested on the live show earlier tonight

333
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:24,120
Um, use, mirror the rating systems that the movies use, I think would be a good way for

334
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:28,320
this rating system to become more socially acceptable, because even though we as gamers

335
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,160
know enough about this system, I don't think parents do.

336
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:34,820
Stop letting your kids play these games, honestly, it's just mature.

337
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:40,260
They don't sell it to minors, so you're buying it for them, shame on you.

338
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:44,720
Why are you coming, I didn't know it was going to be full of blood and violence and stuff,

339
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:49,240
Even though in the back it says, full of blood and violence.

340
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,360
This is interesting.

341
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,240
Another story now.

342
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,160
We're going to get into another story.

343
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:56,360
Xbox is going to be getting, you remember how Fable came out

344
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,720
for the Xbox, and then people were like, oh, it's good,

345
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,600
but it's short.

346
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,360
So they released the version on the PC

347
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,000
called The Lost Chapters, which is

348
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,360
like a longer version of Fable.

349
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,080
Well, guess what?

350
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:08,000
Xbox is now getting Fable The Lost Chapters.

351
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,480
And when I read about this, I was like, damn it.

352
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,760
I just spent $30 on Fable not that long ago.

353
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,480
And get this.

354
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,800
Fable of the Lost Chapters is gonna be a budget title, 20 bucks.

355
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:20,400
So people like me who just recently bought the game are SOL.

356
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,480
Thank you! Jerks.

357
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,760
No, but that's good news for those folks that haven't played the game yet. This will give them a good

358
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,800
excuse to check it out.

359
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,840
How about we open up the old mailbag? We got a lot of great letters from last

360
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:36,280
week's show, so I think it's time we open up the mailbag. You guys ready for this?

361
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:40,640
Ready. Alright, let's go into the mailbag.

362
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:49,640
First email came to us from Acer800 and Acer800 is a girl gamer and wanted to say this.

363
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:53,640
Your comments on girl gaming last week were pretty interesting and sadly true.

364
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:58,640
I've been playing games since I was a Wii girl. One of the first games I played was Mortal Kombat.

365
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:06,640
I love fighting games and sport games and the feeling of how smug guys are shocked when I kick their butts at Soul Calibur 2.

366
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,000
it's just pretty sad that there are not many hardcore girl gamers that really

367
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,200
admit to it in the States

368
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,360
many girls my age usually are out shopping or some other trendy activity

369
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,720
while I'm at home trying to beat beautiful Joe

370
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,360
hopefully though with the recent increase of girl gamers because of

371
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,960
various RPG and other games like DDR

372
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,040
more girls will be interested in the gaming scene soon but that's just my two

373
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:27,520
cents

374
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,680
and she also has a PS, DarkSakura you're a great representation of a girl gamer

375
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,520
you rock!

376
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:36,320
Aww, that warms my heart. We love having her on the show

377
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:40,600
That, that's quite an achievement there to warm Dark Sakura's cold little black heart.

378
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,600
I'm just kidding.

379
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,600
It's not...

380
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,600
I got shot at looking.

381
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,560
My heart's not black.

382
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:49,840
Now all you need to do Dark Sakura is you need to lick a PSP so you can become famous

383
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,840
like that one chick who did nothing.

384
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,840
Huh?

385
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:53,840
What?

386
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:54,840
What?

387
00:21:54,840 --> 00:22:00,200
The one that's on the red ass baboon site or whatever, the stupid girl gamer reviewer.

388
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,200
Forget it.

389
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,760
The one that's like a chauvinistic, or no, a feminist, yeah, I don't like her.

390
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,760
Alright.

391
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,600
okay the best the best thing I can see I'm like okay whatever you're on your

392
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:14,060
own world there the best response on planet Loki the best response I can give

393
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:23,180
to that is you go girl you go girl what you go plus plus no no no I meant the

394
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:28,320
girl who send them oh you you do you can we can write us anytime because and I

395
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:32,200
will always respond to your emails usually while I'm at work to go at orange

396
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,040
lounge radio calm let's not forget the guy so we had letters from guys this

397
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:40,040
Ah, who needs them? I mean, I love the boys too.

398
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:45,040
We had an email from Rob send us an email and Rob had a comment on the women gaming issue as well.

399
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:51,040
One huge way to get girls and women to actually like video gaming would be to stop putting out

400
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,040
girl games, quote unquote, that stink.

401
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:58,040
It looks like a lot of girl games for preteens are created with entry level and inexperienced programmers

402
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,040
to cut their teeth on.

403
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:04,040
This makes the preteens hate video games when they grow up, I imagine.

404
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:09,440
Hmm interesting perspectives stop stop putting out such amateurish pink games

405
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:16,180
I call them the pink game or Mary-Kate and Ashley. Wayne of vista interactive needs to stop putting out titles for the Gameboy Advance

406
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:21,480
Like for example the Raven Lizzie McGuire. That's so Raven three

407
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,480
Okay, and just like you know

408
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,360
Games like that. They're platformers and just awful

409
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:34,120
stop. You know what they need? They need more puzzle games for the home consoles.

410
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:38,360
Because you know what? How many puzzle games have come out for the home consoles lately?

411
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:43,040
None. They need to hire me to design games for them. You know what I think a

412
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:50,040
lot of girls... It's gonna be, chick with big gun shoots a bunch of idiots. Wasn't that a Tomb Raider? No, no, no, no.

413
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:56,240
That's slut with big guns. Sorry, sorry. Okay, I don't want to spend too much more

414
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,100
time on this topic but the best thing about Tomb Raider was Tomb Raider 2

415
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:03,380
because you could do a little button press code and she'd explode you could

416
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:07,580
also go on her back you can shut the butler in the walk-in for a year and he

417
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:10,700
wouldn't follow you anymore and then you could jump off the balcony and should

418
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:16,380
break her neck if you do like a dive Wow that's why Tomb Raider 2 is the best of

419
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:20,240
the series um you know I think more girls would like Final Fantasy like 10

420
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:25,700
if they gave it a chance you know and everybody can like okay but the thing

421
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:30,420
about it there are some 10 2 great shit well 10 2 is more like a girl power type

422
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:35,220
game but 10 there's guys and girls can agree I mean the girls in that are great

423
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:38,980
characters and there's different types you know you have your kind of slutty

424
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:44,060
Riku but Yuna is a strong woman and Lulu's kind of the sassy one. Yuna is just

425
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:50,080
determined but she's all okay I'm self-spoken okay I'm going to be a

426
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:56,320
summoner and die oh wait this sucks and my man is I don't want to spoil it all

427
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:01,400
right let's get let's get to another email this email came to us from Tom Tom

428
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:06,000
W thank you very much for the email once to let us know that we actually last

429
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,720
week we were talking about Bomberman and we said we couldn't think of one on the

430
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,460
Genesis he wanted to let us know there actually was a Bomberman game on the

431
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:17,520
Genesis mega Bomberman I actually have that somewhere and you forgot and I

432
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,600
forgot because I have too many games

433
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,080
well he also sent us a picture so thank

434
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,320
you very much for bringing back the

435
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,280
memories there and did mega bomber man

436
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,360
when we make mistakes what can we say

437
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:29,120
except me because I never admit to them

438
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,680
all right one more email here this was

439
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:35,080
from our love I like that name I love I

440
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:37,280
like that email a lengthy email here I

441
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,760
can only read a little bit of it has to

442
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,440
do with the PlayStation 3 remember we

443
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,720
were talking about no hard drives on ps3

444
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,280
what's the big deal

445
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,960
he basically says in his email here the

446
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:51,240
reality is that this is a way for Sony to get more money from people by nickel

447
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:56,000
and diming consumers on peripherals this is one thing I hate about Sony they put

448
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,360
out a hard drive with Final Fantasy 11 bundled because they knew someone would

449
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:03,800
buy it with the assumption that there would be content that uses it can't say

450
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:07,400
I disagree I think the nickel and timing is one way to look at it you know why

451
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:11,080
why bundle it in we can get you to charge more but if you but all the game

452
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:16,640
companies are doing it take a Nintendo after no Tory oh yeah Nintendo take the

453
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:21,160
Xbox hello the DVD playback kit if that wasn't nickel-and-dime in you I don't

454
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:25,400
know what is you know what do they do these you can't even you know back on

455
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:29,040
the Dreamcast mm-hmm you know they put out this broadband adapter that two

456
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:35,460
games used so accessible on PSO mm-hmm so so from from my perspective you have

457
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:39,360
a point but all the game companies are doing this it's not just Sony but on the

458
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:43,000
other part is that that being said a hard drive in PlayStation 3 would have

459
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,620
been a bigger deal than it is that is because there would have been games in

460
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:49,900
such that would support having it xbox had that blinks game

461
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:53,700
and in-game custom playlist on certain games which made a case if not a small

462
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:54,180
one

463
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:57,620
for having it i would love to believe the developers could dig up a bit more

464
00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:01,500
creativity if they realize more uses for an in console hard drive

465
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:06,460
ya know what rocked about the xbox hard drive is modding it and putting games on it

466
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:08,940
WOOHOO fun

467
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:12,180
I don't disagree with what he's saying though because you know like

468
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:15,380
loading times could be reduced and things of that sort and he also talks about his email

469
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:19,640
That's exactly why I have that you know what my PlayStation 2 hard drive is for

470
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:22,620
HD loader yeah, I use it for

471
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:25,580
Shortening those load times. Yeah

472
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:29,220
Games that I have owned all right have

473
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:32,420
Thanks for the emails you guys we always love your perspectives

474
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:37,700
Um if you have a comment you can always email that to us to go at orange lounge radio.com is the address

475
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:42,420
let's look at some more gaming news going on space invaders you know space

476
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:46,660
invaders according to the latest issue of Famitsu space invaders is coming to

477
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:53,140
the PSP and this will be released in Japan for $45 and I can't help but think

478
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:59,380
I can play it on my Atari for free it's it's it's a souped-up version of the

479
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:03,220
classic but from the screenshot I saw a trackball from the screen well you've

480
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:06,540
got that little analog thing I guess from the screenshot I saw it just looked

481
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:09,960
like a souped-up version of the original but nothing to scream about but I'm

482
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:14,280
thinking $45 for Space Invaders which I'm sorry in my opinion Space Invaders is

483
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:19,740
kind of one of those overrated classics like to me I don't know give me a game

484
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:24,780
like Galaxian, Gyruss. I think Gorf for the same game. Gorf was awesome.

485
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:29,100
Gorf was like three different games in one. I'm not all about the

486
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:33,480
Space Invaders Pac-man Warship I get that Space Invader Warship not so much

487
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:38,480
But admittedly and before someone sends an email on this. I understand it was a huge deal in Japan

488
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,000
It was a much bigger deal there and it was here

489
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,920
Yeah, so I can see that and this game is only announced for Japan at this time

490
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:48,200
So maybe it makes a little more sense to that. I don't know but even the recent pac-man title

491
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:53,760
I think the whole reason for cost though is I don't know it was the same reason why Nintendo 64 games were so expensive

492
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,920
it was

493
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,360
you know

494
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,360
their

495
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:03,240
format, the UMD format. Well now to be fair they are doing

496
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:06,440
some new modes in the Space Invader. They have this galaxy beat

497
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:10,800
which is like a 3D graphics mode and it plays in a first-person view

498
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:14,760
and the invaders have been updated so you know they've got some new things

499
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,720
they're trying but

500
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:20,080
I don't know it's nice. Do you remember like the old, Atari did this. They updated a

501
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,880
bunch of their old games like Pong was one of them and

502
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,960
did they do Warlords? I don't remember but then you had Frogger came out in here as

503
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,520
well

504
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,520
How many Frogger games have there been?

505
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:35,520
Seriously, but like Ms. Pac-Man, I think they read it a lot of old games.

506
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:39,520
I just remember a version of Warlords being in Lunar.

507
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:44,520
Lords of Lunar, when they put it out on the PS2.

508
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:50,520
This strikes me as those updates, and I do remember the Pong one was actually pretty cool, but the rest of them...

509
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,520
You want to talk about update games that are good?

510
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,520
Huh.

511
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,520
New SEGA Ages have been announced!

512
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,520
Oh really?

513
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:59,080
Yes, and these are good ones.

514
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,240
For example, the one that I'm happiest about

515
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,520
is Panzer Dragoon.

516
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,360
They're going to remake the whole game

517
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:07,280
and include the original on it.

518
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,520
It's coming to the PS2.

519
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:13,400
Some people knocked the original classics that came out on PS2,

520
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,920
saying it just didn't do justice to the original game.

521
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,240
These are basically in Famitsu.

522
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,480
And basically, it's going to start with volume 22.

523
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,840
The first one, we have the Sega Memorial Selection,

524
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,440
which will feature five old games, including Head-On,

525
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,880
tranquilizer gun

526
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:30,080
uh... in doki-doki penguin land

527
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:34,400
uh... they have the galaxy force to uh... which is gonna be uh... ported

528
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,540
form and

529
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:36,720
scan um...

530
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,760
this is actually uh... started in in order to give the game a perfect port

531
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,920
for the first time

532
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:45,800
uh... see here we've also got gun star heroes treasure box

533
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:50,320
and then started heroes of uh... dynamite heady alien soldier

534
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:54,160
and says that three of his treasures well-known megadrive titles and uh...

535
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:58,240
treasure rocks yeah it just and they also have you know dynamite deco which

536
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:04,360
was diehard in the arcade game well I hope they I hope they really like it

537
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:08,360
is dynamite cop you know be interesting um Loki since you're at it why don't you

538
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:14,000
let us know what's going on in the hack hack and crack scene today okay well

539
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,400
basically the major stuff is they've that the games well they're being

540
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:23,100
pirated now and all the UMDs have been dumped and now they're running on their

541
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:27,740
home version, or running on the actual PSP memory cards now.

542
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:29,640
So not just Luminous, like last week.

543
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:35,460
And Luminous has sound, so Luminous, Coded Arms, and the thing, the major websites behind

544
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:41,380
us now, We Are Back is one of the groups that's behind the loaders, they just released 2.5

545
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:45,780
of their loader, which is going to be a teaser for number 3, which is going to be the full

546
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:47,820
loader to load anything.

547
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:52,140
The ones now, they basically use a normal UMD.

548
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:55,100
You might have, for example, most of them use Wipeout.

549
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,980
And you basically have Wipeout in your drive

550
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:58,740
and you can run it off your memory card.

551
00:31:58,740 --> 00:31:59,920
Coded Arms is out there.

552
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,740
A lot of Japanese games are out there and that type of thing.

553
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:03,580
So that's out there.

554
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:06,340
Remember, kids, this is only to make backup copies of games

555
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:07,380
you already own.

556
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:08,260
Right, OK.

557
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,220
And then the other thing that was announced

558
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:14,380
is there's another group that's working

559
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:22,020
on creating an external device to actually be able to run other types of memory cards,

560
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:31,540
like for example USB flash drives, hard drives, and SD digital, SD cards and whatever, so

561
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:33,480
basically other medias.

562
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:37,960
And there's another website, I believe we are back as also them, with PSP development

563
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:42,560
that they're going to make it so you can flash your PSP back to 1.5 or 1.0.

564
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:49,400
So the shit has hit the fan, pretty much it's game over.

565
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:53,720
I'll be interested to see if Sony doesn't try to shut some of that stuff down, we'll

566
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,720
see.

567
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,620
Once it's on the internet though, it's hard to get off.

568
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:57,800
It's pretty hard.

569
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:01,800
Other interesting things though, I should mention the DS, they have Super Nintendo and

570
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,520
Nintendo emulators for it now finally.

571
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,000
Of course those are a little harder to come by.

572
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,880
A little harder to get on there, yeah.

573
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:08,880
Yeah, exactly.

574
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:13,640
They've actually started development on the PSP and the homebrew scene of transferring

575
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:18,920
files back and forth between PSPs via the IR port on them and they actually can transfer

576
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:22,240
via infrared, which is very interesting.

577
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,060
Some other really cool programs are out there.

578
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:31,760
They have PSP Jump, I believe is what it's called, and that's basically, you know, it's

579
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,880
a kind of an audio program.

580
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,800
You can make your own mixes and stuff.

581
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:40,720
PSP Paints is out there, paint program, and the best part also, and this isn't really

582
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:45,880
hacking, is new colored PSPs are rumored to be coming out soon.

583
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,920
One of the colors that's rumored is hot pink.

584
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,280
Wait, the actual, like, frame?

585
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,280
The actual...

586
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,280
But not Sony endorsed.

587
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,280
No, it is Sony.

588
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,280
Oh!

589
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,280
In Japan, of course.

590
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,280
Interesting.

591
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,280
Yeah, but the black one is so cool.

592
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:00,400
Now, if they did a Sakura PSP, I'd have to have it.

593
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,920
I'd go for a nice, like, dark green.

594
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,600
So that's what's really going on right now.

595
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:08,760
If you wanted to play a good, you know, updated port of a game or whatever, the new Namco

596
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:13,600
Battle Collection, all remade games, it's got Rally X, Dig Dug, and all that stuff,

597
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,680
that's one to check out over, you know, Space Invaders.

598
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:20,840
Is it the same, is it the same updates that have been on like GameCube previously and

599
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:21,840
stuff?

600
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:22,840
No, I don't think so.

601
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,840
Hmm, I'll check that out.

602
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:28,320
I have one quick little slash, slash, hacking and cracking story.

603
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,040
Oh my god, you're into slash?

604
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,040
No.

605
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,960
Wow, that was a Freudian slip, I don't know.

606
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:36,560
Quick hacking and cracking story, I think this one's just cool.

607
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,760
This has to do with the program Stella.

608
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,600
It's an Atari 2600 emulator.

609
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:46,560
Well, Fred Quimby, the guy who develops games for that emulator, he released a BASIC compiler

610
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:50,820
that can be used to create games to run on Stella and, if you think about it, using that

611
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:55,160
same technology, you could actually make your own Atari 2600 games in BASIC.

612
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,160
I just think that's kind of cool.

613
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,160
That's how a lot of them are done.

614
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,160
I don't know why, I just think that's neat.

615
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,160
You want to know what else is cool?

616
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,160
What?

617
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:06,000
emulator on the PSP now, and you know what you can run on Amiga?

618
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,360
Monkey Island.

619
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:13,000
Stella, more information on that emulator, stella.sourceforge.net

620
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,440
and that's S-T-E-L-L-A.

621
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,440
Oh, one last thing I forgot to mention.

622
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,320
Game Maker.

623
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,680
Remember the Game Maker programs?

624
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:21,400
They're on the PC, and they were on the PlayStation stuff.

625
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,840
You can make your own games.

626
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,960
One's coming to the DS.

627
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,400
Like a legit game?

628
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,120
Legit.

629
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:27,840
Awesome.

630
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:28,460
Who's putting it out?

631
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:29,240
Do you remember?

632
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:33,920
believe it's oh god I can't remember who the original company was it's the same

633
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:41,360
company I think RPG maker 3 I got to see RPG maker 3 at their booth at easy here

634
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:47,520
it says right on it it is how was it at e3 it looks pretty good I think it's a

635
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:52,040
whole bunch of it they were more focusing on front mission it does not

636
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:55,880
say mission but I was like isn't that square game they're not permission um

637
00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:01,840
but the other one but apparently I guess with this game maker you can actually

638
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:07,440
make games from a thing from like a multiplayer game to 3d games so it's not

639
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:13,080
just an RPG maker also white DS is coming out soon whoopee doo all right we

640
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,760
here at orange launch radio we're not just about talking about video games all

641
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:19,940
the time because if we talked about video games all the time we would have

642
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:24,600
no time to go out and eat tacos so we are here to better your life and what

643
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:29,320
What better way to better your life than Dark Sakura giving you a little piece of her advice

644
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,320
with her advice column.

645
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:35,960
Dark Sakura, what are you going to talk to us about tonight?

646
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:42,920
Today's life lesson, bit of advice, call it what you will, is how to perform a tracheotomy.

647
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:48,040
Because you never know when you have to give someone a tracheotomy.

648
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:52,680
Number one, find the person's Adam's apple, that's the thyroid cartilage.

649
00:36:52,680 --> 00:37:02,220
Move your finger about 1 inch down the neck until you feel another bulge.

650
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:11,300
The indentation between the two is the cricothyroid membrane where the incision will be made.

651
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:15,860
Using a razor blade or knife, make a horizontal incision about half an inch across and half

652
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:17,980
an inch deep.

653
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:22,100
Pinch the incision open or place your finger inside it to slit it open.

654
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:26,820
4. Insert a tube in the incision roughly a half inch to one inch deep.

655
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:32,140
5. Breathe into the tube with two quick breaths. Pause five seconds and give one breath every

656
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:36,400
five seconds. You will see the chest rise and the person should regain consciousness

657
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:40,540
if you have performed the procedure correctly. However, if you performed it incorrectly,

658
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:43,980
they will bleed to death.

659
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:45,820
Any final pieces of advice?

660
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:51,460
Yeah, just don't go hanging out on the smoking porch when people are about to choke to death.

661
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:55,300
check and see if there's a doctor nearby first you know I really I learned

662
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:59,020
something because I once saw this on a TV show all they did was jam a big pen

663
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:06,300
in there just big pens yep emergency trachea me I was I was you know

664
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:09,140
wondering though a woman doesn't have an Adam's apple

665
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:14,940
yeah but there's there I I did this tried to feel and see I have this thing

666
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:18,820
about my neck where if I touch my neck I get if anything touches my neck I get

667
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:25,820
nauseous but I had to to find and I I think I found the spot for a woman it's

668
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:33,620
about maybe two-thirds down Eve's apple all right anyway this this is kind of

669
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:38,780
interesting the rumors going around the internet that rare which by the way is

670
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:42,780
now like a Microsoft subsidiary instincts they're looking at developing

671
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:47,980
Nintendo DS games which makes a lot of people go huh but sure enough on their

672
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:52,540
website they're looking at it they're looking for experience 3d artists for

673
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:58,480
Nintendo DS and games programmers for the Nintendo DS and this is kind of

674
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:02,580
makes us go huh is Microsoft gonna do something with the DS killer instincts

675
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:08,300
three on the DS what that would make me happy actually if Microsoft has no plans

676
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:12,180
to enter enter the handheld market I could see where this is just saying you

677
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:16,420
know why not make money off someone else's console if assuming again that

678
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:20,320
Microsoft has no plans to enter the market. But of course, have you heard those rumors

679
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,420
about the Xbox 360 is supposed to interact with the DS? I'm like, what?

680
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:24,420
And PSP.

681
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:25,420
What?

682
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:31,740
Yes, and all it is is a docking station. I went to the Xbox 360 demo thing. They have

683
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:38,920
a docking station for the 360 that is basically any USB device or any type of device with

684
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:44,180
transfer capability. They have a docking station to connect to MP3 players like the iPod or

685
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:53,260
the eye River MP3 we have a for a mini disc players for all kinds of variety

686
00:39:53,260 --> 00:40:01,140
for digital cameras scanners they basically are having a docking station

687
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:05,420
to go with the 360 that's going to interface with basically any kind of

688
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:11,600
digital media device what I heard was they're going to be using the Xbox 360

689
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:16,840
as basically you can use the PSP and the DS to play games over the internet, Microsoft

690
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,220
games over the internet.

691
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:24,360
So basically what I'm thinking is it will basically use those two devices as a Bluetooth

692
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,360
controller.

693
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:28,240
I can't believe it until I see it honestly.

694
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,240
I doubt it.

695
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,240
I know.

696
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:34,760
At the demo thing that I went to, they were doing, you know how they do little stylish

697
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:39,240
outlines of different things and showing what, they had a freaking outline of a PSP up there.

698
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,240
That's kind of weird.

699
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,240
That's weird.

700
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:46,520
Well we'll see. Moving on, this is a story that's kind of been making that rounds on

701
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:51,600
the web forums and being passed around via various emails. Get this, an 11 year

702
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:56,720
old boy stabbed his baby nephew in the stomach after the infant's crying

703
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:02,200
disrupted his PlayStation game. The PlayStation game in question had

704
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,840
something to do with the Incredibles, basically some type of port of the

705
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:11,000
Incredibles, and the boy told police that in the minutes before the incident he

706
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:15,920
kept losing while he was playing the game and then the crying made him feel

707
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:21,560
like an erupted volcano sounds like this kid's got anger management issues but

708
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:24,320
what do you think they'll try to pin this on the game anyway I don't think

709
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:30,200
so no because it's Disney or was it Pixar it's that if it were Grand Theft

710
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:35,400
Auto oh yeah rock stars getting a call and then top of that this and this in

711
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:42,600
the UK um the news story I'm getting is from the UK but I actually know and I

712
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:46,880
caught his sling I wanted to oh I wanted to say I thought it was actually in

713
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:51,200
Florida in Florida is there a location listed did you know because they went to

714
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:59,200
to the Diana Princess of Wales Hospital Wow which I don't think there's one in

715
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:04,600
Florida a whole crown court yeah I guess it wasn't yeah I'm sorry this happened

716
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:07,840
It could have happened. I don't know that kind of reaction would happen there

717
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:12,320
Because honestly Americans are a lot more freaking hysterical

718
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:15,020
true, but

719
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:17,160
You know somebody's gonna try and pin this on the games

720
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:24,000
Because video games are evil that that's I don't think that that's the same mindset there that it is here

721
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,560
I would actually really love to hear from any of our UK listeners

722
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,200
Let me you know if there's any type of

723
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:36,080
of flashback, anything that's been in the news or anything, I would seriously like to

724
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:39,420
know because I would love to compare the difference in reaction.

725
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:41,180
That would just amuse me to no end.

726
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:45,480
To go to togo.com if you want to send us one of those emails.

727
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,600
Moving on, trying to wrap it up here.

728
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:51,100
Viewtiful Joe was going to be called Viewtiful Joe VFX Battle.

729
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:54,920
They're changing the name to Viewtiful Joe Battle Carnival.

730
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:57,440
GameCube game coming out September 29th.

731
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,600
That makes me think too much of carnival.

732
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:05,300
I know kind of battle carnivals a little interesting though. We'll see. We'll see

733
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:10,700
And last but not least tonight the guy game you remember this game

734
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:15,820
They got a little bit busted early on because one of the chicks in it was not 18

735
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:19,540
The guy game was banned

736
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:25,220
Which which I was surprised to see that the story had kind of hit

737
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:29,780
This week because I thought the thing got banned months ago when this first came out

738
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:33,800
but I think the PC version came out and it was on shelves basically what it is

739
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:39,460
is that the temporary holding that was on the game became permanent and the guy

740
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:45,660
games website does confirm this just so you know so but you get a copy wait a

741
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:49,500
couple weeks slap that mother on eBay well here's the thing now what they're

742
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:53,720
gonna do is they're going to put it all on a DVD called the guy game game over

743
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:59,340
and sell it for $19.99 probably I would guess without the 17 year old in

744
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:05,060
question they'll just trim her on out of there and have a new DVD so there you

745
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:09,460
have it Loki interested in that purchase at all I already have the guy game and

746
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:14,180
what's what's interesting though is that actually girls gone wild is doing this

747
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:22,140
new thing called girls gone wild like games and it's actually the the little

748
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:25,380
mini not really the mini games but if you've ever Rob play the guy game

749
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:28,940
remember at the very end of the guy game they have the guy game challenge or

750
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:33,740
whatever and where the women would do like they'd bounce on the ball or they

751
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:38,320
were jumping it's all that oh and they got like a minute bonus if they did it

752
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:43,160
topless and things like that it's all that crap so apparently this will be

753
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:47,600
popular how much you want to bet that you know that girls gone well to put out

754
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:52,000
a trivia game just like this something one of these days it's gonna have

755
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,120
competition it's gonna happen and I honestly I think I think the guy game

756
00:44:56,120 --> 00:45:01,840
They should do another one without just me with you making you get idiom first exactly

757
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:07,140
All right, that's gonna do it for another episode of orange lounge radio to go final thoughts loki

758
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:11,040
I'm gonna play me some killer seven and hopefully finish this game

759
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:14,880
My final thought is rubbing together oil

760
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:22,240
Dark Sakura we need the girl game with like you know naked guys, and then the special yaoi

761

762
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:38,520
guys gone wild DVD coming out yay and but my absolute final thought is reject
