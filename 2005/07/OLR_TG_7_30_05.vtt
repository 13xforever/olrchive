there say hello to Dark Sakura Jamie Summers I sound so dead I'm undead you

00:50.980 --> 00:54.840
know suddenly I'm inspired to think about what I saw at Hot Topic today oh

00:54.840 --> 00:58.400
Oh first though let me introduce the one and only, Loki! Hi!

00:58.400 --> 01:03.400
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Anyway, so I was at Hot Topic today, right? That store that sells

01:03.400 --> 01:04.200
all the, you know,

01:04.200 --> 01:07.640
goth-y kind of clothes and I don't know what- Insta-Goth. Sorta.

01:07.640 --> 01:10.920
Hot Gothic. Well right now they're pushing a line of Resident Evil

01:10.920 --> 01:14.080
t-shirts it looks like so when you're kinda doing the I'm so dead kinda makes me

01:14.080 --> 01:14.800
think of Zombie.

01:14.800 --> 01:19.960
I actually have Resident Evil t-shirts. I'm mad though because the shirt that I want they only sell online.

01:19.960 --> 01:23.400
Really? What shirt's that? 2D. They have a Gorillaz shirt.

01:23.400 --> 01:27.240
it's only online that's that's not the same resident evil I'm thinking of

01:27.240 --> 01:31.080
alright anyway I already have a bunch of

01:31.080 --> 01:34.920
like the ones they give to the video game stores I have all kinds of swag

01:34.920 --> 01:38.680
yeah we know you get the hookup lucky you had the major hookup for the rest of

01:38.680 --> 01:39.880
us there's the store

01:39.880 --> 01:43.720
thank you very much I got the major hookup this week Orange Launch Radio needs to

01:43.720 --> 01:46.360
give up some of our listeners the hookup you know we got some prizes we gotta start

01:46.360 --> 01:46.880
giving away

01:46.880 --> 01:50.960
so we'll have to do that in the next few weeks but not not tonight

01:50.960 --> 01:54.560
we're actually taping a little bit early this week because I'm going to be

01:54.560 --> 01:56.400
leaving I'm flying away going to the

01:56.400 --> 02:00.060
East Coast very soon so. I have something for our listeners to hear.

02:00.060 --> 02:03.200
What's that? Your DS?

02:03.200 --> 02:06.720
It's very quiet

02:06.720 --> 02:10.520
it's hard to hear. What is this?

02:10.520 --> 02:15.840
I hear some ambient noises. I have Nintendogs.

02:15.840 --> 02:20.800
Nintendogs? How did you get Nintendogs? Now this is not the Japanese version.

02:20.800 --> 02:27.000
nope it's not this is the u.s. version like we can barely hear it on there

02:27.000 --> 02:30.040
what's okay tell us about your gaming week what's going on here

02:30.040 --> 02:35.880
I have come into a copy of the five-minute demo of the Nintendo oh a lot of people

02:35.880 --> 02:38.720
are gonna start writing you some nasty emails if you had the full version but

02:38.720 --> 02:42.520
still you got the demo that's kind of neat I've been playing with my puppies

02:42.520 --> 02:47.080
what Loki I've got news on that actually there are many people coming into the

02:47.080 --> 02:53.000
copies of Nintendogs early. How so? Well, if we want to get the news right away. No,

02:53.000 --> 02:57.120
let Dark Soccer talk about the game first, then we'll get to that. Okay, so, so tell

02:57.120 --> 03:01.920
us a little more about the game, because at E3, the line was so big to play, I heard it

03:01.920 --> 03:07.000
bark, the line was so big to play this game at E3 that I barely got a chance to really

03:07.000 --> 03:10.280
look at it. I know it was one of my favorite games of the show, but you've actually had

03:10.280 --> 03:14.160
a chance to play it a little more in detail this week. What the heck is Nintendogs? What

03:14.160 --> 03:22.600
makes it so dang special play with your bubbies is what makes it so great though

03:22.600 --> 03:32.520
you play with your puppies that's it you just play with dogs what are you okay so

03:32.520 --> 03:37.240
they're barking we get it that's cute cute if we have the graphics especially

03:37.240 --> 03:41.560
because the graphics are part of this and they start barking along with it

03:41.560 --> 03:48.160
And you can do the frisbee and they catch it have you noticed an object to this game at all like is there so are

03:48.160 --> 03:52.280
You play with your puppies like even it, but even an animal crossing which was a very?

03:52.920 --> 03:57.360
Free game where you could do practically whatever you wanted there was still that goal of paying off your house

03:57.400 --> 03:59.600
Well late as you play through the game

03:59.600 --> 04:04.560
You can train your dogs and stuff and you compete in different like events and stuff like they have a new dog training events

04:04.560 --> 04:06.560
And you unlock more dog breeds

04:06.560 --> 04:12.340
And also, if other people, say for instance you have Nintendogs Chihuahua, and someone

04:12.340 --> 04:18.020
has Nintendogs, um, what was it, Labrador Retriever or something like that, if you're

04:18.020 --> 04:22.500
nearby, and they interact with each other, it unlocks Labrador Retriever and the one

04:22.500 --> 04:25.580
with Chihuahua and Chihuahua and the one with Labrador Retriever.

04:25.580 --> 04:29.100
So even though they're selling this game, like, when they announced it was going on

04:29.100 --> 04:35.380
sale it sounded like Pokemon Red and Blue, where only certain mixes of dogs were going

04:35.380 --> 04:38.140
going to be available in different versions.

04:38.140 --> 04:40.060
Basically, one of the things was also,

04:40.060 --> 04:42.140
remember how they changed some of the breeds that

04:42.140 --> 04:44.380
are in this version, the US versus Japanese?

04:44.380 --> 04:45.460
Yeah.

04:45.460 --> 04:48.100
All the Japanese dogs are unlockable.

04:48.100 --> 04:49.020
They're the unlocks.

04:49.020 --> 04:50.020
Oh, that's kind of cool.

04:50.020 --> 04:52.220
So I get to have my Shih Tzu, right?

04:52.220 --> 04:53.580
Yes, you can have your Shih Tzu.

04:53.580 --> 04:56.020
What we need to see, though, is if the Japanese version

04:56.020 --> 04:57.820
and the US ones will interact.

04:57.820 --> 04:59.100
Oh, that would be interesting.

04:59.100 --> 05:01.140
Because I know people over here with the Japanese version.

05:01.140 --> 05:04.060
And if you walk by with the game and someone else

05:04.060 --> 05:08.760
their dogs, they'll start barking. That's cool. If it detects another copy of the game

05:08.760 --> 05:14.220
on and playing nearby. What did you think after your five minute demo? Puppies! So in

05:14.220 --> 05:17.380
other words, you're sold on this game? Puppies! You'll be buying the full version when it

05:17.380 --> 05:20.980
comes out? All they need, Mike, is Nintendo kitties. Oh, I am buying all three versions

05:20.980 --> 05:25.820
when this comes out. But you don't need all three versions if you get them. I don't care!

05:25.820 --> 05:30.940
I am buying them for the strict purpose of annoying my coworker because he hates this

05:30.940 --> 05:35.820
game because it's so damn cute and so i'm going to be playing it with the volume full blast you know

05:35.820 --> 05:42.140
and just go hey you know what you know what there's three of us three versions of the game lab already

05:42.140 --> 05:47.100
we should get the three three different versions all right there we go and i'll get the shih tzu

05:47.100 --> 05:51.980
hopefully it's in a different one well i was going to get the lab anyway because it has

05:51.980 --> 06:00.460
other breeds that i want like um a jack russell terrier and uh uh i think the miniature dachshund

06:00.460 --> 06:03.900
I'm just gonna buy all three you can't wait to trade

06:03.900 --> 06:08.060
you just need all three well at least I know where I get the dogs from alright anything else in your gaming week

06:08.060 --> 06:12.220
um I play lots of Ragnarok Ragnarok online the old

06:12.220 --> 06:16.660
well I didn't actually play it as me hunting down the Korean version of Ragnarok online

06:16.660 --> 06:19.900
why? because I was gonna start playing on a free server again

06:19.900 --> 06:23.100
isn't Ragnarok 2 on its way pretty soon? I'm waiting

06:23.100 --> 06:26.580
to hear something on the beta of that one I thought I'd read something recently and

06:26.580 --> 06:29.460
forgive me listeners you guys might know more about this than I do but that Ragnarok 2

06:29.460 --> 06:29.980
was

06:29.980 --> 06:34.060
Like around the corner. It was something that was gonna be here by year's end. I could have thought I read somewhere

06:34.060 --> 06:38.340
I hope I keep checking gravity site and then there's another game that one of our

06:38.900 --> 06:42.880
Listeners suggested to us. Mm-hmm. I got an email from Iris

06:44.140 --> 06:50.400
Who is in South Korea? Hi Iris who that was my grandma's name really? That's nice name

06:51.020 --> 06:53.020
Who suggested a game?

06:53.660 --> 06:59.040
That I actually haven't had too much of an opportunity. It's called Darwinia. I like the name already

06:59.040 --> 07:03.760
hmm but I actually was intending on downloading it a couple of days ago and

07:03.760 --> 07:08.200
I had some computer issues is it like a game that you get to win the Darwin

07:08.200 --> 07:12.280
award by having your character be as stupid as possible well you know what I

07:12.280 --> 07:17.200
am something tells me I'm wrong let me let me see if I can find it real quick

07:17.200 --> 07:20.200
okay that's cool in the meantime we'll get back to more on Darwin you later

07:20.200 --> 07:24.840
Loki how was your gaming week would even up to I've been playing star soldier go

07:24.840 --> 07:29.720
Star Soldier that game is awesome for the PSP but what's great about the game

07:29.720 --> 07:32.360
though is you play it like with a vertical screen so basically you have to

07:32.360 --> 07:36.160
turn the PSP on its side so you have a long screen now remember you've been

07:36.160 --> 07:39.300
reporting on these kinds of games on previous shows so it's kind of neat to

07:39.300 --> 07:45.440
actually have one now yeah and it's just really a very cool game highly

07:45.440 --> 07:51.000
recommended I mean I cannot just stress how wonderful this game is also got on a

07:51.000 --> 07:58.000
UMD movie, actually. They hooked me up with Oldboy. It's a Japanese movie, I think. It's

07:58.000 --> 08:03.440
very cool, and so now I have two UMDs, you know, one to go with Spider-Man 2. Whoop-de-doo.

08:03.440 --> 08:07.720
I'm not actually going to buy any more movies, but I've been playing that. I played Bomberman

08:07.720 --> 08:13.880
Panic Bomber, which, you know, I was hoping it was more of a Bomberman game, but it's

08:13.880 --> 08:19.520
another puzzle game. This is the PSP one? PSP one. They have a lot of puzzle games for

08:19.520 --> 08:24.240
the PSP out there and then really, yeah, those have been the games.

08:24.240 --> 08:28.760
Alright, anything else? Just those games? Nah, I wish I had played some PlayStation

08:28.760 --> 08:32.600
2 stuff. I'm waiting for Graffiti Kingdom. They sent out a press release on Thursday

08:32.600 --> 08:37.600
saying, oh, the game got shipped! Go to GameStop. No, we have our information that says it's

08:37.600 --> 08:42.040
coming out on August 8th or August 9th. I'm like, yeah, that's what I heard before this

08:42.040 --> 08:44.400
press release came out. Because nobody wants Graffiti Kingdom but you.

08:44.400 --> 08:47.560
Yeah, they told me, they're all, you're going to have to pre-order this game if you want

08:47.560 --> 08:52.880
at all, because we're getting like three copies total. I'm like, fuck you, I will go to Fry's,

08:52.880 --> 08:57.560
so eat that. Interesting. Is that the sequel to Magic Pen

08:57.560 --> 08:59.080
Gel? Sort of.

08:59.080 --> 09:03.920
It's much of a sequel in the game sense, you know, where you have the same gameplay and

09:03.920 --> 09:07.600
stuff, but the storyline is not a direct sequel. Magic Pen Gel, for those that don't know,

09:07.600 --> 09:11.760
is like this kind of cultish game. I don't think it was really big. It had a rock-paper-scissors

09:11.760 --> 09:17.160
battle style system, so it's pretty simple in concept, but you could draw your own monsters,

09:17.160 --> 09:18.800
which was really the cool thing about it.

09:18.800 --> 09:20.440
You literally drew your own, it's like Pokemon,

09:20.440 --> 09:21.560
but you draw your own Pokemon.

09:21.560 --> 09:24.800
So of course my friends and I were playing this game

09:24.800 --> 09:27.880
and we were drawing all sorts of phallic things

09:27.880 --> 09:32.880
and just all the two-year-old type humor

09:32.880 --> 09:34.280
you could think of when we were drawing

09:34.280 --> 09:37.360
and the game doesn't stop you, so.

09:37.360 --> 09:39.040
Yeah, there was the big cock monster.

09:39.040 --> 09:41.280
Yeah, I remember there was like the big cock monster

09:41.280 --> 09:44.520
and then I'm like, you know, I walked out of the room

09:44.520 --> 09:46.560
for a bit and I come back in, I'm like, is that a cannon?

09:46.560 --> 09:49.560
No, it's a penis! Like, you can't draw. Anyway.

09:49.560 --> 09:52.560
That would be great if I could, like, use my tablet.

09:52.560 --> 09:56.560
But the new thing, though, what's great about this game is it's more of a platformer.

09:56.560 --> 09:59.560
Not really a platformer, it's more of, like, a hack and slash type game.

09:59.560 --> 10:00.560
Oh, cool.

10:00.560 --> 10:05.560
Which is really cool. And, oh my god, they have websites dedicated to what the Japanese have done with this.

10:05.560 --> 10:12.560
They've recreated everything. They've recreated, like, Samus, Link, Gundam, you know, just, like, really detailed stuff.

10:12.560 --> 10:15.560
They've recreated a Terminator Robocop. It's amazing.

10:15.560 --> 10:19.160
It's amazing. I'm excited about the game and Magic Penjal had kind of a

10:19.160 --> 10:22.180
crappy battle system, so I'm glad to hear it's going hack-and-slash.

10:22.180 --> 10:25.380
Alright, Dark Soccer, you found more information on Darwinia?

10:25.380 --> 10:31.200
If you go to Dar... it's d-a-r-w-i-n-i-a dot c-o dot u-k.

10:31.200 --> 10:36.040
Basically, I'll just read the little blurb on here. The World of Darwinia is a virtual

10:36.040 --> 10:40.300
theme park running inside a computer network built by a computer genius

10:40.300 --> 10:44.120
named Dr. Sepulveda, I guess.

10:44.120 --> 10:49.160
okay darwinia is populated by ascension involving life form called the darwinians

10:49.160 --> 10:52.200
they are the product of a decade's worth of research

10:52.200 --> 10:55.720
into genetic algorithms so what kind of game does it look like because i thought

10:55.720 --> 11:00.440
this was just another you know ye old rpg style game but this looks

11:00.440 --> 11:04.360
like a futuristic type thing it looks like the sims meets tron it

11:04.360 --> 11:08.600
looked kind of like lawnmower man to me i don't know but let me look at

11:08.600 --> 11:10.760
a few more of these screenshots on here though it

11:10.760 --> 11:15.760
it really does look very much like crime. Let's download the demo and check it out

11:15.760 --> 11:19.720
because the listener was wanting us to check it out so there's a demo right? Well I had intended on doing so

11:19.720 --> 11:23.080
doing so I'll probably get that started when I get home tonight.

11:23.080 --> 11:27.400
It'll be a follow-up in the future. My gaming week, I didn't play anything new guys

11:27.400 --> 11:30.560
sorry to say I've been preparing for my trip but for some wacky reason

11:30.560 --> 11:34.000
like I decided to get back into Guild Wars because I was like okay I'm not

11:34.000 --> 11:37.160
gonna pay money to reactivate my Final Fantasy XI account when I'm gonna be

11:37.160 --> 11:38.020
leaving soon

11:38.020 --> 11:41.480
and I don't want to start a new game, like I've been contemplating

11:41.480 --> 11:44.780
checking out World of Warcraft, one of my friends is really really trying to get me on there

11:44.780 --> 11:48.740
I know, PSO, Dark Soccer is trying to get me on PSO

11:48.740 --> 11:52.140
but Guild Wars, luckily, loving it

11:52.140 --> 11:55.180
once you buy it, you can play it forever for free, no monthly fee, so I can go

11:55.180 --> 11:58.220
back whenever I want and I knew I would do this too, that I'd play it for two weeks

11:58.220 --> 12:01.580
leave, go back again, but here's the weird thing about my habits with Guild Wars

12:01.580 --> 12:05.180
I started a new character, everybody in my old guild doesn't play the game anymore

12:05.180 --> 12:06.100
so it's just me

12:06.100 --> 12:11.100
So here I am playing the game by myself, and I'm thinking I'm playing an MMO by myself

12:12.980 --> 12:15.860
What's the point but it's still like kind of fun

12:15.860 --> 12:18.860
I think I'd be having more fun if there were people out there that would play with me

12:19.740 --> 12:23.940
Cry if someone would buy me the game. I would play Oh got 50 bucks to spare

12:24.700 --> 12:26.700
If someone would buy me the game I would play

12:27.540 --> 12:33.380
Maybe we got a really light nice listener out there. I don't know sure second pay money for it. I've seen Guild Wars

12:33.380 --> 12:39.900
I like I like Guild Wars. It's neat. It's it's um. It's just I don't like the style

12:42.540 --> 12:46.340
It's more of a strategy like I had a G action fuse

12:46.900 --> 12:51.180
You'll have to pull my cold dead body away from Final Fantasy 11

12:51.180 --> 12:57.140
I may not have played it for over a month, but you know what I am not quitting not from my cold dead

12:57.500 --> 13:02.540
I'm just pissed off that I can't download the Korean version of Ragnarok online cuz

13:02.540 --> 13:08.820
the Korean Ragnarok site is only me get it and I don't want to have to pay

13:08.820 --> 13:12.140
$30 for three more months of Ragnarok online to play my old dead character

13:12.140 --> 13:18.540
thing is my character will on the old Ragnarok will never be deleted for those

13:18.540 --> 13:21.140
that don't know Ragnarok because we've talked about an awful lot tonight real

13:21.140 --> 13:27.220
quick describe it it's really cutesy MMORPG it's adorable it's I found the

13:27.220 --> 13:30.180
picture of your character who wore the little ribbon yes I had a character the

13:30.180 --> 13:35.780
wore a ribbon but it's like Secret of Mana in a way, some folks kinda, but imagine it

13:35.780 --> 13:36.780
as an MMO.

13:36.780 --> 13:37.780
It's very kitschy.

13:37.780 --> 13:38.780
In a 3D world.

13:38.780 --> 13:39.780
Yes.

13:39.780 --> 13:43.200
It's really adorable if you just go to rocknrockonline.com.

13:43.200 --> 13:49.200
Not 3D in the Halo or Doom 3D sense, 3D in the like up at an angle shot.

13:49.200 --> 13:50.200
Like Pac-Mania.

13:50.200 --> 13:53.040
It's a 3D environment but the characters are sprites.

13:53.040 --> 13:54.040
Yes.

13:54.040 --> 13:55.040
There you go.

13:55.040 --> 13:59.040
Alright, quick news story on Final Fantasy XI since Loki brought it up to start us off

13:59.040 --> 14:00.040
tonight.

14:00.040 --> 14:03.200
you're saying they won't tear the game from your cold dead hands. How about a story that

14:03.200 --> 14:07.400
might take you off? Final Fantasy XI, the Vana Deal Collection will ship for the PC

14:07.400 --> 14:13.120
on August 16th. What is this, a new expansion pack? No, it's just Final Fantasy XI, Rise

14:13.120 --> 14:19.120
of the Zilert and Chains of Promathia and Tetra Master all bundled together for $29.99.

14:19.120 --> 14:23.720
So those of you guys that spent 50 bucks on the game and 30 on the expansion just got

14:23.720 --> 14:27.520
screwed. But it happens with every MMO, it really does.

14:27.520 --> 14:30.400
We'll look at Rise of the Zillerts at one time.

14:30.400 --> 14:34.840
It was being sold as an expansion, and they just updated it.

14:34.840 --> 14:35.840
Whatever.

14:35.840 --> 14:38.040
Alright, thought I'd share that.

14:38.040 --> 14:42.240
Let's see, I actually have an abundance of Square news tonight.

14:42.240 --> 14:44.540
Let me get some of these other Square stories out of the way.

14:44.540 --> 14:50.040
Kingdom Hearts 2 has a date, this being announced at the Squeenix Party 2005 event in Tokyo,

14:50.040 --> 14:53.200
hence why we have all the Squeenix news tonight.

14:53.200 --> 14:57.200
Kingdom Hearts 2 will be out in Japan this year in December.

14:57.200 --> 15:01.280
No set in stone date for the US yet, however they've really been pushing to localize their

15:01.280 --> 15:02.280
games quickly.

15:02.280 --> 15:05.640
I have to admit I'm surprised they're going to miss Christmas at this rate.

15:05.640 --> 15:08.520
I would have thought Kingdom Hearts 2 would be a very powerful Christmas title to have

15:08.520 --> 15:09.520
out there.

15:09.520 --> 15:14.400
It seems kind of silly to miss Christmas here, but it ain't my company.

15:14.400 --> 15:19.000
Also keep in mind though, when we get it, it's going to be better than the Japanese

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
one.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
People are going to buy it no matter what.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.920
What makes you say it's going to be better than the Japanese one?

15:22.920 --> 15:25.960
Just like the last one, they actually had to redo an international version.

15:25.960 --> 15:30.880
yes, Square Enix kind of does that stuff where they add like that because the Sephiroth battle wasn't in the original Kingdom Hearts, right?

15:30.880 --> 15:33.800
That was something new for North American. It actually wasn't in ours either, but they brought out the

15:34.520 --> 15:35.560
the

15:35.560 --> 15:41.640
sort of updated international version that had the Sephiroth battle and the deep dive trailer. Interesting.

15:42.280 --> 15:47.680
Final Fantasy 12 also got a date at the Squeenix party. Ships in Japan on March 16th,

15:48.360 --> 15:53.560
2006, so still a little wait, and that's just Japan's date, meaning we've got to wait three to four months.

15:53.560 --> 15:56.420
So maybe we're looking at Christmas next year for Final Fantasy 12

15:57.460 --> 16:02.100
Rumors why because Final Fantasy 12 supposedly is in the can it's done in Japan

16:02.100 --> 16:07.460
It's ready to go just they're putting the finishing touches on it, but supposedly because of the Kingdom Hearts 2 news

16:07.580 --> 16:09.580
That's why they're waiting on Final Fantasy 12

16:10.380 --> 16:16.340
Don't want to they figure it's got the same fan base. I think to an extent they're probably right, but come on

16:16.460 --> 16:20.220
They're gonna buy it should be a Christmas title people that are into one game are gonna buy both games

16:20.220 --> 16:25.520
I don't know crazy with these people think sometimes Final Fantasy 7 advent

16:25.520 --> 16:34.080
children will be released in theaters in Japan probably in theaters in Berkeley

16:34.080 --> 16:38.800
and little tiny I told those Sony reps when they came to our work I'm like you

16:38.800 --> 16:42.900
gotta fucking put this in tears well this is all this marketing I'm like

16:42.900 --> 16:48.440
word-of-mouth word-of-mouth well nothing it not even news on any type of u.s.

16:48.440 --> 16:51.560
release little distribution area no North American distribution as of yet

16:51.560 --> 16:55.160
here's the reason why I'm thinking it's not gonna happen in the US because it's

16:55.160 --> 17:00.280
gonna premiere in Japan on September 8th the DVD by the way comes out September

17:00.280 --> 17:04.800
14th so it's really just a super sneak preview for those diehard people that

17:04.800 --> 17:08.840
have to see it in the theater and if I was in Japan I'd be one of them I think

17:08.840 --> 17:14.600
it's gonna have a limited run here you think I don't um eskaflowne but I had a

17:14.600 --> 17:17.560
limited run but would they get that I mean we're talking energy we're only

17:17.560 --> 17:20.460
about six weeks out from this now I don't think that's enough time to put

17:20.460 --> 17:23.980
together a theater release I do believe that there would be time we'll see we'll

17:23.980 --> 17:30.580
see subtitles on that we'll see screw dubs still more stories still more

17:30.580 --> 17:36.040
stories Kingdom Hearts 2 Hikaru Utada of course did the theme song for the first

17:36.040 --> 17:40.020
Kingdom Hearts game she's coming back she's gonna sing a song called passion

17:40.020 --> 17:45.260
which will be in Kingdom Hearts 2 no word yet as to whether she's gonna

17:45.260 --> 17:48.880
record it in English and Japanese but since she did the first one in English

17:48.880 --> 17:52.820
and Japanese and she is fully bilingual exactly and you know she has her own

17:52.820 --> 17:57.800
album out here which I don't think did so hot it's she's easy breezy in your

17:57.800 --> 18:03.980
Japanese anyway so she'll have the song passion the single should be coming out

18:03.980 --> 18:08.840
being put out by Toshiba EMI will come out around December same time as

18:08.840 --> 18:13.560
Kingdom Hearts 2 is planning to come out one more story I got it's a Final

18:13.560 --> 18:15.100
Final Fantasy XI story again.

18:15.100 --> 18:20.040
You know how Xbox 360 Final Fantasy XI has everybody going OMG OMG what's going to be

18:20.040 --> 18:24.120
different in the Final Fantasy XI version on Xbox 360?

18:24.120 --> 18:29.000
Well you're going to find out if you live in Germany.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
Get this.

18:30.000 --> 18:34.080
They're actually going to be showing it in Germany at the games convention in Lipsig.

18:34.080 --> 18:37.240
That happens August 17th through the 21st.

18:37.240 --> 18:41.000
It doesn't say in the press release that it's going to be playable but it does say in the

18:41.000 --> 18:44.920
press release that European gamers will get their first look at the next

18:44.920 --> 18:49.160
generation gateway to the world of Anadiel should be interesting you know I

18:49.160 --> 18:52.760
heard a rumor one quick rumor about for those you Final Fantasy 11 players I

18:52.760 --> 18:56.680
don't know if this is true or not but what they're gonna do with the 360 is

18:56.680 --> 18:59.960
they're gonna put the same upgrades in 360 that they do on the PC and

18:59.960 --> 19:03.160
PlayStation 2 users unfortunately gonna get left behind in this but that they're

19:03.160 --> 19:06.280
gonna make the capes viewable it's supposedly something because you know

19:06.280 --> 19:09.080
how your character won't wear a cape in Final Fantasy 11 but you never see it

19:09.080 --> 19:13.200
supposedly that's gonna be one of the graphical upgrades so I don't know take

19:13.200 --> 19:15.860
it with a grain of salt people we'll find out when the game is shown in

19:15.860 --> 19:18.640
Europe but that would be kind of neat. Maybe it's an option you would be able to turn on in

19:18.640 --> 19:21.960
the PC version if you have high enough graphics card. Oh I don't see why not

19:21.960 --> 19:26.340
certainly. My graphics card would handle it. Yeah I'm surprised they haven't released a

19:26.340 --> 19:29.960
patch like that for capes in the PC version. Well maybe they're waiting for

19:29.960 --> 19:34.760
this. Yeah well you never know I mean they can do who knows with that um the

19:34.760 --> 19:38.640
new 360 game coming out they're probably gonna release another expansion at the

19:38.640 --> 19:43.620
same time there you go maybe maybe we don't know yet well possibly all right

19:43.620 --> 19:47.900
we'll see anyway let's go past the Squeenix news and let's get into

19:47.900 --> 19:51.900
inflating our egos a little bit by opening up the old mailbag so if you

19:51.900 --> 19:57.100
want to send us an email all you have to do is send an email to to go to at

19:57.100 --> 20:02.100
orange lounge radio.com and dark Sakura will have something to say to you dark

20:02.100 --> 20:07.380
Sakura what do you have to say tonight I actually got a bunch of email and one

20:07.380 --> 20:14.060
the first one I want to bring up is by someone named Roo who wrote into us

20:14.060 --> 20:19.900
about the whole hot coffee deal and actually and this is something that I

20:19.900 --> 20:24.220
actually didn't see on any of my references but when I went back and dug

20:24.220 --> 20:29.980
deeper after receiving the email yes it is true and the whole deal was actually

20:29.980 --> 20:37.140
sort of launched off by Hillary Clinton kinda she got behind it too I think

20:37.140 --> 20:41.760
I think she, having her behind it really threw the thing into orbit.

20:41.760 --> 20:43.920
I mean it was kind of like where it went to the next level.

20:43.920 --> 20:49.280
But I believe it was originally brought to the attention by Assemblyman Li Lin Yi I think

20:49.280 --> 20:56.400
because they had this guy on G4TV and usually I don't talk about G4TV because they have

20:56.400 --> 21:00.720
a reputation for kind of having bad programming, but actually it's gotten a lot better.

21:00.720 --> 21:05.760
And I actually watched G4TV.com and ever since they got that new guy on the show, he's really

21:05.760 --> 21:09.600
brought it up in the two girls are up to that same level i think is actually had

21:09.600 --> 21:13.180
the legal any on their show and it was actually pretty good interview i have to

21:13.180 --> 21:14.140
say so

21:14.140 --> 21:17.260
this kind of interesting i thought sorry just wanted to get that

21:17.260 --> 21:19.780
well this email though uh...

21:19.780 --> 21:24.240
you know it's basically it's not just the conservatives that are behind it

21:24.240 --> 21:25.180
we've got

21:25.180 --> 21:28.480
basically everybody and you know it also brought brought up to uh...

21:28.480 --> 21:32.700
the whole reason why i didn't go democrat way back we know because of

21:32.700 --> 21:34.460
lieberman

21:34.460 --> 21:36.620
I was not gonna have Lieberman and Tippercore

21:36.620 --> 21:38.820
anywhere near our video game industry.

21:39.780 --> 21:43.060
There was also, though, another article, though,

21:43.060 --> 21:44.780
this made me think of,

21:44.780 --> 21:46.680
that I'm gonna get back to the mailbag,

21:46.680 --> 21:50.740
I just have to see where I stored this article,

21:50.740 --> 21:54.060
about how, actually, the rate of crime

21:54.060 --> 21:58.620
in our country's youth decreased.

21:58.620 --> 21:59.460
You have a link to this?

21:59.460 --> 22:01.380
I bet a lot of people would be interested in reading this.

22:01.380 --> 22:02.300
Yes, I do.

22:02.300 --> 22:05.120
and it's gonna take me just a brief moment.

22:05.120 --> 22:06.800
Actually, if you'll take care of one of our other emails.

22:06.800 --> 22:08.160
That's all right, yeah, I'll go to one of the other emails.

22:08.160 --> 22:09.440
I just wanna say, was that the same guy

22:09.440 --> 22:12.000
who you invited to do the article for the site?

22:12.000 --> 22:14.560
Yes, it is, I invited him to write an editorial

22:14.560 --> 22:15.400
regarding that for us.

22:15.400 --> 22:16.220
That'll be cool.

22:16.220 --> 22:20.880
Like I said, guys, politics and gaming podcasts

22:20.880 --> 22:23.840
sometimes don't mix, but that's all right.

22:23.840 --> 22:26.160
Hey, we gotta, whatever you believe in,

22:26.160 --> 22:27.440
at least go out and vote,

22:27.440 --> 22:28.640
because we get the freedom to do that in this country.

22:28.640 --> 22:31.320
She just, you know, here's what it comes down to, okay?

22:31.320 --> 22:36.560
Okay, the whole hot coffee mod hit a little too close to home, if you know what I mean,

22:36.560 --> 22:40.400
with Hillary Clinton, because the whole hot coffee mod starts off with CJ coming in for

22:40.400 --> 22:42.880
some lovin', what's the woman do?

22:42.880 --> 22:45.000
She gets down to business.

22:45.000 --> 22:51.240
Oh damn, oh damn, oh, oh, oh, wait, wait, oh that happened to Hillary, that happened

22:51.240 --> 22:52.240
to Hillary.

22:52.240 --> 22:57.280
Look, look, look, look, I think the issue here is really about the regulation of the

22:57.280 --> 23:01.880
not trying to ban them and I think remember guys Hillary Clinton isn't

23:01.880 --> 23:05.840
trying to ban the game she's trying to regulate them so she's basically again

23:05.840 --> 23:10.360
encouraging parents not to do their job which I you know and even though I am a

23:10.360 --> 23:13.500
Democrat I'll admit it I don't necessarily have to support her on every

23:13.500 --> 23:17.320
little thing she does this is one of those things where I think every senator

23:17.320 --> 23:21.560
Republican Democrat and the one independent guy could all be educated on

23:21.560 --> 23:24.560
the gaming world a little bit thank you very much all right here well I didn't

23:24.560 --> 23:28.080
have that article here okay cool it can be located I'll go ahead and give the

23:28.080 --> 23:36.020
address it's gr bolt comm slash articles slash violence slash violence dot HTM

23:36.020 --> 23:44.100
hey has a violence in there twice anyway this was written by Duke Ferris who

23:44.100 --> 23:46.960
writes on this site it's a game revolution is what it is so he's

23:46.960 --> 23:52.780
basically presenting facts to show that violence has gone down not up amongst

23:52.780 --> 23:58.780
This information that he's reported on here is actually a very well-written article, which really surprised me for this site.

23:58.780 --> 23:59.780
Wow.

23:59.780 --> 24:09.780
It's using statistics put out by the U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Statistics, and information also pulled from the files of the FBI, public files.

24:09.780 --> 24:16.780
Um, basically, it's showing that since right before the release of, uh, the PlayStation,

24:16.780 --> 24:24.780
we've got, uh, basically a mark showing from 93 on, crime has decreased.

24:24.780 --> 24:29.780
See, I don't know, there's gotta be a loophole somewhere because, and now granted, I'm about to say,

24:29.780 --> 24:33.780
watching the news every night, you would think the complete opposite to be true, but yes, I know.

24:33.780 --> 24:35.780
Of course, the news is trying to glamorize this.

24:35.780 --> 24:37.780
The news sensationalizes it. Anyway.

24:37.780 --> 24:42.380
You know, again, they make their money by fooling the public.

24:42.380 --> 24:46.180
Here come those emails again. Wait, you mean it's

24:46.180 --> 24:49.340
not hot outside? Anyway,

24:49.340 --> 24:52.780
check out the article. Give the link one more time. Draw your own conclusions from

24:52.780 --> 24:53.620
this guy. No, no, no.

24:53.620 --> 24:56.940
Again, keep in mind, I'm not really talking, you know, your local news

24:56.940 --> 25:00.500
is cool, I think. At least,

25:00.500 --> 25:03.780
you know, whenever I watch the news here, I don't see anything over, you know, sensational or

25:03.780 --> 25:04.740
anything

25:04.740 --> 25:10.820
out of the ordinary. I'm talking about like they pick one instance and then it's all on CNN.

25:10.820 --> 25:16.580
You're talking about like MSNBC doing the Michael Jackson trial 24-7. Exactly. Now that I can agree

25:16.580 --> 25:20.260
with. It's like they take one issue, blow it way out of proportion until suddenly the entire

25:20.260 --> 25:27.300
public thinks every kid who ever plays a video game is gonna come cut off my head in my sleep.

25:27.300 --> 25:34.420
Oh. Lord have mercy we all gonna die from GTA. Yeah that. Which I'm sure you're gonna talk

25:34.420 --> 25:41.380
about the grandma oh yeah I'll bring up grandma on a minute what go ahead there

25:41.380 --> 25:46.780
was one other thing in here I mean it's basically one of the charts on here

25:46.780 --> 25:52.500
which is what I would like to show to most of our listeners is that there is a

25:52.500 --> 25:57.500
very good chart on here that separates everything by age by age group and

25:57.500 --> 26:02.380
actually in the group the biggest decline in violent crime was between the

26:02.380 --> 26:05.380
14 and 17-year-old group.

26:05.380 --> 26:06.060
It's wow.

26:06.060 --> 26:07.860
OK, well, give the link one more time.

26:07.860 --> 26:09.300
Let folks draw their own conclusions.

26:09.300 --> 26:13.900
It's dr.bolt.com slash articles slash violence slash violence

26:13.900 --> 26:14.800
dot htm.

26:14.800 --> 26:16.860
And I'll go ahead at some point.

26:16.860 --> 26:18.180
Post that in our forums.

26:18.180 --> 26:21.820
Actually, we'll repeat a link to the article on our announcement

26:21.820 --> 26:22.420
from the website.

26:22.420 --> 26:24.100
Sounds good.

26:24.100 --> 26:26.300
All right, did you still want me to read the next letter?

26:26.300 --> 26:28.980
OK, I got an email here from Justin M.

26:28.980 --> 26:31.500
And this is nice because this is just nothing but an ego

26:31.500 --> 26:35.460
inflation letter I like many others discovered your fine podcast through

26:35.460 --> 26:38.640
iTunes version 4.9 and I just want to let you know that you were doing a

26:38.640 --> 26:42.100
wonderful job with it thank you I have heard of orange launch radio before but

26:42.100 --> 26:45.020
didn't have the time to sit down and listen to a live show every week the

26:45.020 --> 26:49.620
shows we do on Sunday night having it readily available on my iPod to listen

26:49.620 --> 26:56.300
to whenever I'm ready to just is the grammar gets weird here unbelievably huge

26:56.300 --> 26:59.500
step in the right direction for talk shows and it really helps bring out some

26:59.500 --> 27:03.940
the talent that would otherwise lie untapped well that's quite a compliment

27:03.940 --> 27:08.020
thank you very much for that email and the most we can ask get a friend to

27:08.020 --> 27:10.840
subscribe to the show tell one person about the show and then the news of

27:10.840 --> 27:14.080
orange lounge spreads everywhere and we're all happy and you're happy because

27:14.080 --> 27:18.120
you get a new show every week and etc etc I did want to make a mention that

27:18.120 --> 27:22.120
one of our listeners Michael I thought was really cool that we were talking

27:22.120 --> 27:26.740
about scorched earth dude scorched earth was the game I that was my junior high

27:26.740 --> 27:31.660
school lunches for like a year it is still the game in fact still waiting for

27:31.660 --> 27:37.300
them to finish the PSP homebrew version of PSP home huh they are I fully

27:37.300 --> 27:45.100
endorsed the PSP for these reasons and then there was also one of our

27:45.100 --> 27:52.620
Macintosh supporters wrote in but I know where this is going Loki and I said I

27:52.620 --> 28:00.620
I forward this to Loki earlier. No offense, because I appreciate receiving the email.

28:00.620 --> 28:05.620
But when one is speaking of the general intelligence level of a Macintosh user,

28:05.620 --> 28:09.620
make sure you use your spell checker and grammar checker before sending your email.

28:09.620 --> 28:14.620
Because I counted no less than 15 grammatical and spelling errors.

28:14.620 --> 28:21.620
That's ironic. Loki, just shut up. I have a Mac story at the end and I think it's cool.

28:21.620 --> 28:26.420
I'm not knocking the max, okay, because, granted, the processing power may not be what I was

28:26.420 --> 28:27.420
looking for.

28:27.420 --> 28:28.420
Their cases look cool, though.

28:28.420 --> 28:29.420
Okay?

28:29.420 --> 28:30.420
Their cases are nice.

28:30.420 --> 28:31.420
Freaking widescreen monitor on the outside.

28:31.420 --> 28:32.420
Hold on.

28:32.420 --> 28:33.420
Hold on.

28:33.420 --> 28:34.420
The monitor is nice.

28:34.420 --> 28:37.380
Did we go to Bizarro Orange Lounge Radio, because I just heard Loki say something nice

28:37.380 --> 28:38.900
about a Macintosh.

28:38.900 --> 28:43.180
The cases look nice, but that's all they are is just a big graphene calculator inside of

28:43.180 --> 28:44.180
a nice case.

28:44.180 --> 28:45.180
No, no, no.

28:45.180 --> 28:47.180
Somebody put a death threat out on you, didn't they?

28:47.180 --> 28:48.180
No.

28:48.180 --> 28:56.620
It's like I had I you know when we were conversing about this while I was supposed to be at work.

28:56.620 --> 29:05.060
The Mac is a very I think best used for either people who are not up to a PC or for the professional

29:05.060 --> 29:07.980
needing the specific benefits that a Mac provides.

29:07.980 --> 29:12.620
Let me put it this way if you're going to pick between a Mac an iMac or whatever and

29:12.620 --> 29:18.100
an e-machine go with the iMac because e-machines suck even more and that's pretty bad.

29:18.100 --> 29:20.100
That was kind of a nice thing

29:20.660 --> 29:26.700
We're not make sure you're on there. I'm on Oh E machines. However are very good for modifying

29:26.940 --> 29:31.220
They are very easily upgraded all right anyway back to the anyways back to the although

29:31.220 --> 29:33.340
I was at the Apple Store today, and I drew a little bit

29:33.340 --> 29:39.820
I want to fries, and I'm thinking about getting and I'm actually five see we're gonna outnumber you soon enough all right

29:39.820 --> 29:46.340
I'm there just because a regular g5 is freaking expensive. Let's go. Let's move on and that 30 inch widescreen monitor

29:46.340 --> 29:52.000
I got an email here. Can I read this one? Okay. Okay. This was somebody who has way too much time on their hands

29:52.000 --> 29:59.520
It's from cliff our cliff sent us a email letting us know our statistics that as of on August 1st

29:59.760 --> 30:07.400
2005 not counting our e3 episodes 30 podcast episodes spanning over 17 hours and 400 megabytes

30:07.480 --> 30:10.960
Our shortest podcast was the very first one on January 3rd

30:10.960 --> 30:15.780
19 minutes and 46 seconds and our longest podcast had a running time of

30:15.780 --> 30:21.260
exactly 46 minutes and get this cliff figured this out for us average podcast

30:21.260 --> 30:27.520
episode 33 minutes 24 seconds you know I didn't care before but I do now that was

30:27.520 --> 30:30.340
very cool thank you cliff for he actually saved me a lot of work cuz I

30:30.340 --> 30:33.980
was gonna start putting that together for some of our business things going on

30:33.980 --> 30:37.260
the side we're gonna beat that 46 minutes records we don't get to the next

30:37.260 --> 30:40.820
same it so you got any more emails one more actually been sent the week before

30:40.820 --> 30:44.060
but I hadn't had a chance to read it because I've got a lot of email from him

30:44.060 --> 30:49.140
sure that's cool um one of our regular Sunday night listeners right on our live

30:49.140 --> 30:55.660
show wrote in DJ Ranma s oh in this email he he said this his 13 year old

30:55.660 --> 31:00.060
cousin got GTA San Andreas for ps2 now he plays this game all the time and

31:00.060 --> 31:03.420
believe it or not knows that knows better the interactions of the game has

31:03.420 --> 31:07.140
no effect on him I say that because his mother and me talked to him all the time

31:07.140 --> 31:10.620
about these games gangs life and everything else I admit he does hang out

31:10.620 --> 31:18.420
with friends that act more ghetto than CJ at times but I I can't believe that

31:18.420 --> 31:23.580
he doesn't do anything they do and that I was right and I'm going to quote here

31:23.580 --> 31:27.500
parents if you were listening to this podcast your kids need home training

31:27.500 --> 31:32.220
teach them the difference between real life and fantasy for God's sake well said

31:32.220 --> 31:36.700
I think I think gamer parents are pretty well aware of that stuff I hope I really

31:36.700 --> 31:41.860
hope anyway we're going into a new generation of gaming parents remember

31:41.860 --> 31:47.220
parents treat games like they're drugs talk to your kids you know if you talk

31:47.220 --> 31:50.620
to your kids about drugs they're less likely to do drugs just like you know

31:50.620 --> 31:53.780
they're more likely to know the difference between right and wrong if

31:53.780 --> 31:58.940
you talk to them yes really like you're in a very nice mood tonight Loki you

31:58.940 --> 32:02.660
know you're all about love and affection so once we bring up grandma it's going

32:02.660 --> 32:06.100
I have a hug. No, you know that made me think of one thing

32:13.700 --> 32:15.860
Okay, I'll talk about grandma now get this an

32:16.740 --> 32:20.700
85 year old woman suing take to entertainment over the hot coffee mod

32:21.020 --> 32:26.100
She purchased the game for her 14 year old grandson and is now suing

32:26.580 --> 32:29.860
Take to I this has been passed around on every gaming message board

32:29.860 --> 32:33.100
surely those you guys that are checking gaming websites of any capacity have

32:33.100 --> 32:38.260
heard about this and you probably just went WTF lady why are you buying this

32:38.260 --> 32:42.140
game for your 14 year old kid in the first place again that's another case of

32:42.140 --> 32:50.580
a person in a parental you know position not doing their research and not doing

32:50.580 --> 32:56.140
their goddamn job and she's got some balls to be suing take to entertainment

32:56.140 --> 33:01.660
over it too she's gonna lose she bought the game and gave it if she did not want

33:01.660 --> 33:05.100
offensive material to be put in the hands of a child she would have done her

33:05.100 --> 33:08.800
research don't you think but what she's saying is that now the game is a oh she

33:08.800 --> 33:13.540
wasn't fully educated before you know what it still had an M rating on it just

33:13.540 --> 33:16.940
playing devil's advocate here I'm not gonna disagree with you people I'm just

33:16.940 --> 33:20.180
playing devil's advocate still had an M rating on it damn it I thought that game

33:20.180 --> 33:26.080
was rated R not NC 17 what the hell okay listen grandma first off okay I know

33:26.080 --> 33:29.920
you might have wandered in there, you know, because you didn't know where you were and

33:29.920 --> 33:32.120
you might have bought this game for your, you know, grandson.

33:32.120 --> 33:35.720
You know, I'm thinking the grandson probably begged her to buy it.

33:35.720 --> 33:38.280
Okay, so she bought the game.

33:38.280 --> 33:44.120
Did it say in the article that he figured out how to unlock the hot content or the hot

33:44.120 --> 33:46.040
coffee mod content?

33:46.040 --> 33:47.440
No, it did not.

33:47.440 --> 33:51.640
It specifically said because she found out that that content was in there.

33:51.640 --> 33:58.300
we could say that he may not have been exposed to this content at all so she's

33:58.300 --> 34:04.080
retarded she is friggin retarded okay she has no legal precedent either way

34:04.080 --> 34:06.920
her lawyer is not gonna try to dissuade her because her lawyer is still gonna

34:06.920 --> 34:12.320
make his money moving on that's that's all I want to say about grandma she's

34:12.320 --> 34:16.200
getting too much media attention anyway there was another popular story that was

34:16.200 --> 34:20.360
going around the internet this week involving a particular gamer and dark

34:20.360 --> 34:26.440
you have a story on this one a blind teenager from Lincoln Nebraska who can

34:26.440 --> 34:30.760
kick anybody's butt at Mortal Kombat basically although I think this article

34:30.760 --> 34:34.840
is pretty stupid just because they talk about decapitations in Soul Calibur I

34:34.840 --> 34:38.400
know don't happen that was the first thing I noticed in the article too that

34:38.400 --> 34:41.880
made me kind of go stupid media person do your research before you talk about

34:41.880 --> 34:45.200
games they talk about decapitation in Soul Calibur which doesn't happen this

34:45.200 --> 34:49.200
guy probably thought that Soul Calibur that the reporter must have been blind

34:49.200 --> 34:52.680
too because apparently Soulcalibur 2 and Mortal Kombat Deadly Alliance are the

34:52.680 --> 34:59.360
same game but at any rate it sounds like that he just learned by trial and error

34:59.360 --> 35:03.920
how to play and you know people would correct him when he did something wrong

35:03.920 --> 35:07.000
his favorite thing he wants to be a video game designer when he graduates

35:07.000 --> 35:12.600
which you know if I could see happening but you know no pun intended he plays

35:12.600 --> 35:18.960
facing thank you plays facing away from the screen people challenge him strictly

35:18.960 --> 35:22.520
on his blindness and he still kicks their butt which I can actually

35:22.520 --> 35:25.840
understand that if you understand the timing of your attacks know who you're

35:25.840 --> 35:31.880
using and hear the reaction on screen there shouldn't be any I challenge you

35:31.880 --> 35:38.160
on mute but but still but still a heck of an accomplishment I mean even though

35:38.160 --> 35:41.520
we could kind of think about okay this is probably how he does it still that

35:41.520 --> 35:44.560
what a what a lot of time and patience and discipline to become that good at a

35:44.560 --> 35:49.120
game so apparently he enjoys freaking people out by playing backwards that's

35:49.120 --> 35:56.320
cool can we play him on Xbox Live does have a screen screen tag but you know if

35:56.320 --> 36:02.120
he happens to be listening to you know his name Bryce yes he is listening to

36:02.120 --> 36:05.800
this podcaster if anyone who's listening to this podcast knows him we

36:05.800 --> 36:09.460
would love to interview him absolutely and we would love to challenge him on

36:09.460 --> 36:14.920
Xbox live absolutely to DDR I'm just kidding I'm kidding I have I have the

36:14.920 --> 36:18.880
Mortal Kombat game we could play that or Halo hey anybody can beat my ass and

36:18.880 --> 36:27.680
Halo hey I had an eight-year-old kid an Xbox controller moving on another news

36:27.680 --> 36:32.440
story coming up here g4 yeah that big video games award show that happens on

36:32.440 --> 36:37.280
g4 every year it is going to air on August 9th but that doesn't mean we

36:37.280 --> 36:42.020
won't ruin it for you right now the game of the year was Halo 2 favorite

36:42.020 --> 36:47.180
character was the Kratos and God of War EB gamers choice award went to World of

36:47.180 --> 36:53.660
Warcraft did Katamari Damacy win anything yes best innovation that one

36:53.660 --> 36:59.840
game let's see how many awards Halo 2 got best boss best multiplayer game best

36:59.840 --> 37:05.360
original soundtrack best shooter best sound design best voice performance and

37:05.360 --> 37:09.240
and game of the year so it's a halo to whoring fast you know where it is

37:09.240 --> 37:12.800
other than license soundtrack worse love for grand theft auto that game was at

37:12.800 --> 37:13.240
the top

37:13.240 --> 37:17.200
is still at the top of the charts and all the guy's best origin best license

37:17.200 --> 37:20.560
sounds for a license soundtrack was the only word that lame

37:20.560 --> 37:25.080
lame lame lame halo was just another first-person shooter

37:25.080 --> 37:28.560
grand theft auto san andreas was revolution

37:28.560 --> 37:32.280
there's tons of emails coming your way they're gonna disagree with you on that

37:32.280 --> 37:37.800
I personally I actually enjoy Halo 2 more than Grand Theft Auto I do I think

37:37.800 --> 37:43.980
the multiplayer party aspect of it makes it for me a more fun game but I still

37:43.980 --> 37:46.760
don't know if I would have called it well yeah I think I would have had to

37:46.760 --> 37:50.680
have called a game of the year I mean let's face it as neat of a game as

37:50.680 --> 37:53.680
Katamari Damacy was and some of these other games came out in the past year it

37:53.680 --> 37:58.760
really was a Halo 2 year so I can't say I necessarily disagree just the the

37:58.760 --> 38:02.540
whoring in every category okay let the other games have a little room to breathe

38:02.540 --> 38:06.940
please people moving on dark soccer you have any other news stories for us

38:06.940 --> 38:13.160
tonight um we actually um a game that's coming out shortly and I'm actually

38:13.160 --> 38:16.100
trying to get the u.s. release date because I know it's coming out very soon

38:16.100 --> 38:21.580
Fire Emblem path of radiance is coming out my fiance has just been pissing his

38:21.580 --> 38:25.040
pants waiting for this to come out because thank you for that visual thank

38:25.040 --> 38:28.600
you well he's been even you know downloading because we were very

38:28.600 --> 38:33.800
disappointed when you know the fire the fire emblem on a Game Boy Advance that

38:33.800 --> 38:37.720
had Marth and Roy in it it didn't come out over here but the one after that did

38:37.720 --> 38:42.840
which actually is a prequel to that and then the one following came out Dan's

38:42.840 --> 38:45.800
has really been in the fire emblem and it actually may be the first strategy

38:45.800 --> 38:49.400
game that I might actually give a serious chance the last one I played was

38:49.400 --> 38:56.920
the macross game on the pc engine which anyway um but fire emblem uh path of radiance is coming out

38:56.920 --> 39:01.800
to gamecube and i was checking out the uh uk news and of course i saw that i instantly went to it

39:01.800 --> 39:06.760
um path of radiance has a uh november release date i don't have the specific date but it's

39:06.760 --> 39:12.520
said to come out this november and uh apparently they're working on the pal conversion at present

39:12.520 --> 39:18.760
and are ready to have it out all right very cool it's it's got some pretty screenshots on it too

39:18.760 --> 39:22.640
It's really gorgeous, but it's still the same term-based strategy.

39:22.640 --> 39:25.600
Loki, what's going on in the hack and crack world right now?

39:25.600 --> 39:29.760
Lots of stuff, especially with people getting their panties in a bunch

39:29.760 --> 39:30.440
over

39:30.440 --> 39:34.200
version 2.0 of the firmware for PSP. You've got

39:34.200 --> 39:37.360
a brand new home brew version of

39:37.360 --> 39:40.400
a web browser that's actually been released right now. Now there's four

39:40.400 --> 39:41.720
options for web browsing.

39:41.720 --> 39:44.920
This one is called actually

39:44.920 --> 39:52.440
The 2CH browser, and really the first version of it can only visit the site 2ch.jp or something,

39:52.440 --> 39:56.640
some Japanese site, but the new one you can actually adjust the.ini file to cite your

39:56.640 --> 40:02.560
own bookmarks and whatnot, but more work needs to be done on this because it's still not

40:02.560 --> 40:07.760
too snuff with the 2.0 browser, which actually supports Java and downloads and whatnot.

40:07.760 --> 40:09.400
So that's pretty cool.

40:09.400 --> 40:14.880
Also, one of the really cool games that came out this week for the PSP homebrew was actually

40:14.880 --> 40:21.000
port of Super Smash Brothers. No way. Yeah, Super Smash Brothers GP, which was actually

40:21.000 --> 40:26.720
for the console GP32, they made it for that portable system, but now they've ported it

40:26.720 --> 40:32.200
and you can put your own characters in there. Does it look like the GameCube one though?

40:32.200 --> 40:38.640
No. It has the look and feel. It has the feel of it, it's not exactly the same detail and

40:38.640 --> 40:41.980
But hey homebrew come on. I mean it's still fun, but

40:42.900 --> 40:44.900
so that that came out and

40:45.100 --> 40:52.960
Oh Sony is letting everyone know not to upgrade your US PlayStation portables to the 2.0 because that's meant for only Japanese

40:53.340 --> 40:59.360
Playstations and it could harm your PlayStation and turn into a brick so will that stop you know no that won't stop people

40:59.360 --> 41:02.600
But anyways as far as the DS stuff goes here

41:02.680 --> 41:07.660
There's been a few things being worked on a brand new Super Nintendo player for it

41:07.660 --> 41:12.260
But, honestly, emulation on the DS is tough, especially when you have to get all those

41:12.260 --> 41:15.700
external cards and whatnot.

41:15.700 --> 41:20.100
But anyways, earlier we had people asking us about some of the stuff going on in the

41:20.100 --> 41:22.360
PC mod community and stuff.

41:22.360 --> 41:26.580
So we've got a couple that look pretty interesting that I thought I'd bring up.

41:26.580 --> 41:30.960
The first one is Antlion Troopers Deuce for Half-Life 2.

41:30.960 --> 41:35.060
This is sort of like a Starship Troopers type mod for it.

41:35.060 --> 41:36.060
That's cute.

41:36.060 --> 41:37.060
That's cute.

41:37.060 --> 41:44.060
have the topless shower scenes. I don't know about that, but the UMD does. But you can

41:44.280 --> 41:51.280
get that at antlions.hl2world.com, so check it out there. The other one, and one of my

41:53.400 --> 41:59.080
personal favorite webcomics, Penny Arcade, someone did the cardboard showdown with cardboard

41:59.080 --> 42:05.080
tube samurai, and this I believe is for, oh god, I can't remember what game it's for now.

42:05.080 --> 42:11.400
way to go unreal tournament that's right and um you can check this out at obeythetube.com

42:11.400 --> 42:14.840
very cool very cool it's good thank you for following up on the mods it's cool

42:14.840 --> 42:19.800
a couple quick news items here then we're going to get to the advice column uh the matrix online

42:20.520 --> 42:26.440
is going down from nine servers to three they're scaling back to three servers starting august 2nd

42:27.560 --> 42:31.640
i don't know that's probably a sign that it's not doing as well as they yeah they said that

42:31.640 --> 42:35.940
the reason why they're scaling back is because there wasn't a lot of players on it one time

42:35.940 --> 42:39.580
or whatever, so they're cutting them back. Two of the servers are going to be standard

42:39.580 --> 42:41.920
servers, one of them is going to be a PVP server.

42:41.920 --> 42:47.320
That's kind of sad to hear that Matrix Online, or the Matrix franchise in general has just

42:47.320 --> 42:48.640
been going downhill.

42:48.640 --> 42:51.680
Well, I don't know, maybe their servers can handle more people, and so they want more

42:51.680 --> 42:55.800
people crammed into the city, because the city was huge, so it might just be the world's

42:55.800 --> 42:56.800
too big.

42:56.800 --> 43:02.860
see MTV they are going to have a category for the best video game

43:02.860 --> 43:06.660
soundtrack as part of their upcoming video music awards what video game

43:06.660 --> 43:09.760
soundtracks have to do with music videos I don't know but they're adding the

43:09.760 --> 43:14.860
category anyway Tony Hawk's underground to Def Jam fight for New York Midnight

43:14.860 --> 43:20.320
Club three dub edition Madden NFL 2005 and Dance Dance Revolution extreme all

43:20.320 --> 43:25.900
nominated in this category yeah no it no acknowledgement for ultra mix too though

43:25.900 --> 43:29.600
The Xbox version which arguably had the better soundtrack at least in my big fat opinion

43:30.300 --> 43:35.460
All right. Anyway, um, oh one more. I want to do one more soundtrack story, then we'll get to the advice column

43:36.160 --> 43:42.220
Namco museum, you know, they got this game the Namco museum 50th anniversary arcade collection. Well get this

43:42.220 --> 43:47.220
They're actually gonna license music that you can kind of have as your soundtrack to go with this game

43:47.220 --> 43:52.880
They're gonna license. Come on, Eileen lover boys working for the weekend fine young cannibals. She drives me crazy

43:52.880 --> 43:57.800
crazy the romantics with talking in your sleep and Daz bands joystick are just

43:57.800 --> 44:02.400
some of the titles that are being announced for the upcoming Namco Museum

44:02.400 --> 44:05.320
and by the way Namco Museum is going to be a budget title it's going to be out

44:05.320 --> 44:15.200
for only $19.95 but my question where's pac-man fever in all this where is it

44:15.200 --> 44:21.760
but the quintessential Namco 80s tune come on people oh yes let's get to the

44:21.760 --> 44:27.720
Actually, speaking of Namco, there was a 7-Up commercial in the 80s where someone was playing

44:27.720 --> 44:32.240
Pac-Man and it played this song that sounds almost like Bette Davis' Eyes, except it's

44:32.240 --> 44:36.520
Pac-Man chasing the ghost, stopping, getting all out of breath, dehydrated, and drinking

44:36.520 --> 44:38.160
a 7-Up on screen.

44:38.160 --> 44:41.520
Can you download that on one of those retro commercial websites?

44:41.520 --> 44:45.480
I think so, but I think my fiancé has it on his computer, which is still not hooked

44:45.480 --> 44:50.540
up because our house is still being unpacked, but if I can, I'll try to rip the audio out

44:50.540 --> 44:51.540
of it.

44:51.540 --> 44:58.540
Alright, now we here at Orange Lounge Radio, we're not just here to talk about video games all day long, which should be pretty evident tonight,

44:58.540 --> 45:01.540
but we're here to better your lives as well.

45:01.540 --> 45:08.540
Because if we stayed home and played video games all day long, we'd have no time to go out and film commercials.

45:08.540 --> 45:12.540
Which we've never done, but I just thought I'd throw that out there. We were willing to.

45:12.540 --> 45:14.540
Much nicer than what I was thinking.

45:14.540 --> 45:16.540
What were you thinking?

45:16.540 --> 45:18.540
Forget it.

45:18.540 --> 45:23.540
It's Dark Soccer's advice column, you know it by now. What are you going to talk to us about tonight?

45:23.540 --> 45:27.540
Tonight's bit of advice is how to escape from a sinking car.

45:27.540 --> 45:29.540
Okay.

45:29.540 --> 45:33.540
This is like if you happen to drive your car off into the river or something.

45:33.540 --> 45:37.540
Number one. Open the window as soon as possible.

45:37.540 --> 45:41.540
Opening the window allows water to come in and equalize the pressure.

45:41.540 --> 45:44.540
Two. If you cannot roll your windows down, break the glass.

45:44.540 --> 45:47.540
Use your foot, shoulder, or heavy objects such as an anti-theft steering wheel lock.

45:47.540 --> 45:52.580
lock. The club, the cops, they use it to escape from your car when it's under water.

45:52.580 --> 45:58.500
Interesting. Three, get out as soon as you can. Floating time will range from a few seconds to a

45:58.500 --> 46:04.660
few minutes. Four, if you are unable to open the window or break it, wait until the car fills with

46:04.660 --> 46:09.300
water. When the water level reaches your head, take a deep breath and hold it. Now the pressure

46:09.300 --> 46:12.740
should be equalized inside and outside and you should be able to open the door and swim to the

46:12.740 --> 46:19.860
the service but you know my number one thing is you know hmm you know don't

46:19.860 --> 46:25.700
drive after having that adios motherfucker I had one of those you don't

46:25.700 --> 46:30.380
drive after that you will end up in the bay yeah don't drive into the bay people

46:30.380 --> 46:33.900
unless you're playing driver 3 because that's about the only fun thing to do in

46:33.900 --> 46:40.180
that game and just in I should go ahead and now since it's very obvious that I

46:40.180 --> 46:46.700
have a source for my advice. The worst case scenario survival handbook is a wonderful

46:46.700 --> 46:52.820
thing. It teaches you all kinds of ways to keep from getting trapped in an elevator and

46:52.820 --> 46:57.260
controlling runaway camels. Very nice. They sell a calendar or something? I have a calendar.

46:57.260 --> 47:00.800
We should really plug them so we don't, they don't sue you. Yeah, I've been getting my

47:00.800 --> 47:06.900
advice, but this is all stuff I knew anyway. Okay. You never know when you have to cross

47:06.900 --> 47:11.820
a piranha infested river okay I'm gonna laugh I'm gonna laugh when these days

47:11.820 --> 47:16.580
when someone actually I was on this runaway camel he saved my life thank you

47:16.580 --> 47:20.020
orange lounge you know I'm waiting for the podcast alley votes this month

47:20.020 --> 47:22.780
because we usually have a couple people that leave these smartass comments to

47:22.780 --> 47:25.700
say like orange lounge taught me how to have a baby and like all these crazy

47:25.700 --> 47:28.980
things which is cool so I'm looking forward to seeing those types of things

47:28.980 --> 47:34.980
come up this next month when people can vote again yes all right every second

47:34.980 --> 47:42.940
moving on rumble roses xx that's right all the rumble roses and that's coming

47:42.940 --> 47:49.340
out on the Xbox 360 hmm why didn't they call this rumble roses xxx gee let me

47:49.340 --> 47:52.940
think about this one for a little bit because that's basically what it will be

47:52.940 --> 47:59.480
I saw pictures it's pretty and none of the customizable none of the existing

47:59.480 --> 48:04.000
characters will be replaced fans of the series should check out changes to the

48:04.000 --> 48:07.100
known roster before inquiring about new characters so they're gonna kind of

48:07.100 --> 48:10.120
change but none of the characters are leaving supposedly so should be very

48:10.120 --> 48:14.240
interesting it needs customizable characters they saying though that they

48:14.240 --> 48:18.080
are not thinking about mud wrestling they want to do something else that's

48:18.080 --> 48:23.680
stunning so I guess I haven't thought of it yet cream corn corn cream corn kids

48:23.680 --> 48:31.680
cream corn brawn panty match it wasn't that what the whole game was anyway it's

48:31.680 --> 48:35.560
completely different side of the spectrum here WB interactive will be

48:35.560 --> 48:41.240
putting out a game on consoles and PC and it's called friends the one with all

48:41.240 --> 48:46.920
the trivia that's right it's a game dedicated to friends trivia yes I saw

48:46.920 --> 48:54.240
this it's sad Joey is your best friend moving on you will make him a ham

48:54.240 --> 48:59.360
sandwich every morning please watch Joey somebody please watch it and buy him

48:59.360 --> 49:05.040
hundreds of dollars in pants sorry that's the only episode I remember was

49:05.040 --> 49:09.040
the subliminal message I I remember smelly cat that's about it but I don't

49:09.040 --> 49:13.600
want to give that show any more time on this show midway midway is putting out a

49:13.600 --> 49:17.680
sequel to The Suffering it's a sequel to the popular shooter called The Suffering

49:17.680 --> 49:20.980
the ties that bind and they just wanted to let you all know that they landed some

49:20.980 --> 49:24.820
major Hollywood talent to be doing the voice acting Michael Clark Duncan

49:24.820 --> 49:28.100
remember that guy who's in the Green Mile and the Planet of the Apes and

49:28.100 --> 49:32.860
Daredevil he will be doing a villainous character in the game and Rachel Griffiths

49:32.860 --> 49:37.540
who is in Six Feet Under and Hillary and Jackie and probably nobody that listens

49:37.540 --> 49:40.980
to the show remembers this movie but I remember her at Muriel's wedding she's

49:40.980 --> 49:45.060
going to be doing a role in this as well. So some big Hollywood talent coming to

49:45.060 --> 49:49.500
The Suffering. Might add also The Suffering starts in three different ways

49:49.500 --> 49:53.820
depending on how you ended the first game. Huh. Yeah. Or The Suffering starts

49:53.820 --> 49:58.780
if you choose to buy a Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen game instead. Bad joke. Yeah.

49:58.780 --> 50:07.460
Dark Soccer, you had another story for us? I sure do. I actually wanted Yahoo! UK put

50:07.460 --> 50:10.860
up the top 100 computer games of all time oh very interesting well now we

50:10.860 --> 50:16.860
don't have time to read all 100 but all right top 10 works number 10 elites for

50:16.860 --> 50:21.660
the BBC micro which is a system I need to get because I don't have one I hope I

50:21.660 --> 50:24.700
will have heard of some of these games sorry UK listeners I just don't know

50:24.700 --> 50:29.220
that it's very vector II okay then we have golden eyes 007 for the Nintendo

50:29.220 --> 50:34.260
64 I know that one that game makes me violently motion sick but but for shooter

50:34.260 --> 50:39.100
fans great game it was a great game but it did make me violently motion sick

50:39.100 --> 50:45.220
next up we have Street Fighter 2 okay definitely hey version revolutionized

50:45.220 --> 50:50.940
arcades absolutely Super Mario Kart for the Super Nintendo uh old favorite of

50:50.940 --> 50:55.460
mine love it monkey island to let Chuck's revenge for the PC hell yeah

50:55.460 --> 50:59.360
that's an interesting one to have in the top 10 a good choice but that's kind of

50:59.360 --> 51:03.380
like that well that's number five okay what else number four Legend of Zelda

51:03.380 --> 51:08.360
ocarina of time for the Nintendo 64 I know the hate mail is gonna come in but

51:08.360 --> 51:11.840
ocarina of time was not as great of a game as everybody says it was no wasn't

51:11.840 --> 51:15.520
this the Super Nintendo one was leaps and bounds better in my opinion but

51:15.520 --> 51:19.240
maybe I just I can't get the 3d Zelda thing I don't know well I'm excited

51:19.240 --> 51:23.120
apologize that one was number five oh sorry and listeners nevermind Rob

51:23.120 --> 51:28.200
because he's on crack shut up hated it Super Nintendo one was the best shut up

51:28.200 --> 51:33.240
moving on Pro Evolution Soccer 4 on the PlayStation 2 put up by Konami hmm

51:33.240 --> 51:36.940
whoa soccer and not football

51:36.940 --> 51:39.360
uh... your mike's going out again i don't know what's going on sorry

51:39.360 --> 51:41.520
konami published it with soccer in the title

51:41.520 --> 51:43.160
but it is football

51:43.160 --> 51:44.000
okay

51:44.000 --> 51:46.240
uh... number three

51:46.240 --> 51:48.840
pokemon red and green

51:48.840 --> 51:49.760
all right

51:49.760 --> 51:53.240
okay there's a big audience for that and it reaches a lot of people so

51:53.240 --> 51:56.120
pokey pokey

51:56.120 --> 51:57.240
top two

51:57.240 --> 52:01.160
number two super mario sixty four for the nintendo sixty four

52:01.160 --> 52:02.480
that game was fun

52:02.480 --> 52:09.160
Again the most overrated, but this is the thing with Nintendo 64 games their franchise games were incredibly overrated in my opinion

52:09.160 --> 52:10.160
Goldeneye was a good game

52:10.160 --> 52:12.000
It's described hmm

52:12.000 --> 52:17.200
it says their childhood hero able to go anywhere and do anything to an extent that is purely magical and

52:18.320 --> 52:24.080
Doesn't hold the candle to mario 3, but that's just my big fat opinion all right the number one game

52:28.240 --> 52:30.240
Tetris for the Gameboy

52:30.240 --> 52:35.440
No no pac-man anywhere in the top 10 which is considered the granddaddy

52:35.440 --> 52:40.840
however DDR was number 50 at 49 interesting all right well Tetris and it

52:40.840 --> 52:45.120
was right above afterburner which I honestly like better than DDR everybody

52:45.120 --> 52:48.480
plays Tetris so I can't I can't argue with that as the number one choice I

52:48.480 --> 52:52.520
really can't Tetris is the ultimate game to take on an airplane all right a

52:52.520 --> 52:57.180
couple more stories for you guys we've had a bit of Konami news tonight we got

52:57.180 --> 53:03.060
another one they are partnering up with the American Idol franchise which is it

53:03.060 --> 53:06.600
now American Idol games have come out being published by Codemasters but you

53:06.600 --> 53:10.140
may or not know Konami has this very successful series of singing games

53:10.140 --> 53:14.300
called karaoke revolution which is kind of like DDR mixed with singing yeah it's

53:14.300 --> 53:16.940
funny guys probably seen this funny because the first American Idol game

53:16.940 --> 53:21.900
sucked it really did like yum we need to change something I think that something

53:21.900 --> 53:25.100
would be the game not sucking honestly in my opinion this is a very smart

53:25.100 --> 53:29.220
partnership you've got a franchise that will get this game a wide audience which

53:29.220 --> 53:34.700
karaoke revolution deserves it's a great innovation on the product and konami is

53:34.700 --> 53:38.700
bringing a good game to the American Idol name assuming now they're not saying

53:38.700 --> 53:41.940
they're not confirming that it's going to be a karaoke revolution marriage the

53:41.940 --> 53:46.060
American Idol game but come on what else is it gonna be people be karaoke it's

53:46.060 --> 53:51.420
gotta be sometimes then they're gonna see DVR think you can dance please

53:51.420 --> 53:57.860
please no please don't end there and there it's gonna happen all right and

53:57.860 --> 54:06.900
Wow all right moving on feel the magic you remember that game on the DS it's

54:06.900 --> 54:10.700
kind of like a dating sim type game but it was like WarioWare mixed with sprung

54:10.700 --> 54:14.980
I guess you could say feel the magic even though it wasn't the most hugely

54:14.980 --> 54:20.300
popular game it's actually getting a sequel Famitsu magazine mentions that

54:20.300 --> 54:25.100
field magic xxy y is going to be getting a sequel guess what the sequel is called

54:25.100 --> 54:30.940

54:30.940 --> 54:43.620

54:43.620 --> 54:47.100
Grand Theft Auto San Andreas's hot coffee mod?

54:47.100 --> 54:48.100
Anyways.

54:48.100 --> 54:52.060
You got another quick story before I get to tonight's last story.

54:52.060 --> 54:58.540
Like I hinted at earlier about the Nintendogs thing, selected members of Nintendo.com who

54:58.540 --> 55:04.660
are registered there will receive their copies of Nintendog on August 22nd, or before the

55:04.660 --> 55:09.700
August 22nd release date actually, and the rumor is it's probably going to be the people

55:09.700 --> 55:13.700
that had the most usage of their forms.

55:13.700 --> 55:16.700
Anyways. Lucky you people!

55:16.700 --> 55:19.700
So yeah. Send me a copy. Alright.

55:19.700 --> 55:23.700
And also one more thing, and it's not too much of a surprise since there's a lot of

55:23.700 --> 55:26.700
instant messaging on the Xbox 360.

55:26.700 --> 55:29.700
They're gonna have a QWERTY controller as well.

55:29.700 --> 55:32.700
One of those ones with a stupid little keyboard on the bottom. Fun fun.

55:32.700 --> 55:37.700
Interesting. Alright, one more story for you guys tonight. I promise you a Mac story.

55:37.700 --> 55:44.700
story, here's your Mac story. If you are an OSX user, you must check this out. mikezornek.com.

55:46.020 --> 55:53.020
That's m-i-k-e-z-o-r-n-e-k dot com slash coco, c-o-c-o-a, slash megaman effect. And what this

55:54.620 --> 56:01.140
is, this is an application so that when you launch an icon in OSX, it actually does the

56:01.140 --> 56:08.140
megaman effect from megaman 2

56:08.500 --> 56:09.700
so it's gonna be like

56:09.700 --> 56:14.380
calculator exactly so every time you launch an application

56:14.380 --> 56:16.220
the icon comes out

56:16.220 --> 56:19.940
and you get the little megaman 2 info oh my god that'd be so annoying but i gotta put

56:19.940 --> 56:22.240
i would totally put that on my computer at home

56:22.240 --> 56:26.020
are you saying you're gonna buy a mac i'm not gonna buy a mac for that fuck that

56:26.020 --> 56:28.620
he'll port it

56:28.620 --> 56:31.500
All right, that would be so annoying.

56:31.500 --> 56:32.680
They should do that with everything.

56:32.680 --> 56:33.520
Tell me that's-

56:33.520 --> 56:34.340
Hamburger!

56:34.340 --> 56:35.180
Dude!

56:36.700 --> 56:37.680
All right, that's it.

56:37.680 --> 56:39.440
You guys, good job, by the way.

56:39.440 --> 56:41.580
It's ironic we read that email about stats tonight

56:41.580 --> 56:44.020
because we damn near made an hour tonight.

56:44.020 --> 56:45.660
But that's what happens when you don't tape

56:45.660 --> 56:48.060
a three hour show before doing the podcast, I guess.

56:48.060 --> 56:50.260
We have all kinds of energy.

56:50.260 --> 56:51.100
That's right.

56:51.100 --> 56:52.140
Making podcasts all night.

56:52.140 --> 56:54.420
You're not so dead sounding tonight, Dark Soccer.

56:54.420 --> 56:55.740
No, I'm not!

56:55.740 --> 56:57.180
Oh my God, who is that?

56:57.180 --> 56:58.300
Guess what, guess what, guess what?

56:58.300 --> 57:00.720
You know what was brought to my attention? I'm a girl!

57:01.440 --> 57:02.200
WOW!

57:02.200 --> 57:04.500
Hey! Guess what? Who's at the door?

57:04.500 --> 57:05.700
It's Pizza Man!

57:05.700 --> 57:07.800
Do-do-do-do-dooooo!

57:11.700 --> 57:13.200
Mailman! No!

57:15.300 --> 57:16.100
Okay, god.

57:16.100 --> 57:17.200
Alright, um...

57:17.200 --> 57:19.200
And now it's time for the final thoughts!

57:20.500 --> 57:21.900
Alright, just kidding. Just kidding, people.

57:21.900 --> 57:23.800
Alright, uh, Loki, your final thought.

57:23.800 --> 57:25.400
My final thought is...

57:25.400 --> 57:29.840
I must play more star soldier and god damn it they better have my copy of

57:29.840 --> 57:34.000
graffiti kingdom. Dark Sakura, besides getting your mic fixed what's your final

57:34.000 --> 57:34.380
thought?

57:34.380 --> 57:39.840
Sometimes the reason why I say I don't play any games during the week is because I have a life!

57:39.840 --> 57:42.960
I work and I go to college! Sue me!

57:42.960 --> 57:46.680
Somebody ruffled your feathers this week didn't we?

57:46.680 --> 57:50.200
And my final thought...

57:50.200 --> 57:53.480
I'm hungry so I'm gonna go have a pizza.

57:53.480 --> 57:57.480
Maybe you should call him the pizza man!

57:57.480 --> 58:00.480
Goodbye everybody, thanks for tuning in, see you next time on the Orange Line.

58:06.480 --> 58:11.480
She got beat up by a pizza man!

58:11.480 --> 58:15.480
Put down the joke, step away from the joke.

58:15.480 --> 58:17.480
Hey, at least it's not, you know, cake pie anymore.

58:17.480 --> 58:19.480

58:19.480 --> 58:20.480
