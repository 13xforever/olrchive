02:21.740 --> 02:23.380
What's the stupidest line you can say?

02:23.380 --> 02:24.380
Oh, there it is!

02:24.380 --> 02:25.380
There it is!

02:25.380 --> 02:26.380
Get it!

02:26.380 --> 02:27.380
Get it!

02:27.380 --> 02:28.380
Get it!

02:28.380 --> 02:29.380
Get it!

02:29.380 --> 02:30.380
Got it!

02:30.380 --> 02:31.380
Yeah!

02:31.380 --> 02:32.380
I laughed.

02:32.380 --> 02:33.380
Anyway, yeah, you laughed and you called me.

02:33.380 --> 02:34.380
Oh, you're an idiot.

02:34.380 --> 02:35.380
They made me look like a dumbass on TV.

02:35.380 --> 02:36.380
That's funny.

02:36.380 --> 02:37.700
And I watched and I'm like, huh?

02:37.700 --> 02:38.700
What the hell?

02:38.700 --> 02:39.700
Yeah, buddy.

02:39.700 --> 02:42.580
Loki, what have you been up to this week, game-wise?

02:42.580 --> 02:48.300
Besides gawking at the TV, I've been playing Intelligent License, which is yet another

02:48.300 --> 02:52.560
Japanese PSP game. It's, um, for those who might remember back in, I think it was

02:52.560 --> 02:56.700
PlayStation, um, Intelligent Cube, where you, like, heck yeah, I remember how Intelligent Cube,

02:56.700 --> 03:00.220
like, it was awesome. Where you, like, dodge cubes or something. I can't remember that game too

03:00.220 --> 03:03.720
well, but I did play it. You, you run around this big field, basically, and these

03:03.720 --> 03:07.900
cubes are slowly rolling at you, and you have to trap cubes, basically. You, you,

03:07.900 --> 03:11.180
it's like a puzzle game. You lay a green square on the ground, and you can pull a

03:11.180 --> 03:15.980
cube, but you can only do certain ones. Like, you don't want to pull the black

03:15.980 --> 03:20.140
cubes and then there are certain ones that will cause chain reactions but you

03:20.140 --> 03:24.060
only have so many cubes you can pull before they roll you over that's the

03:24.060 --> 03:27.540
whole puzzle so you have to use the multi trap cubes. The whole point of that

03:27.540 --> 03:31.540
game I think was to test your intelligence and this is more the same

03:31.540 --> 03:35.900
this game that reminds me of the VR missions from Metal Gear Solid because

03:35.900 --> 03:40.400
it's very similar that you have to like you know go through mazes you have to

03:40.400 --> 03:43.580
dodge like people with like these security guards with flashlights and

03:43.580 --> 03:47.420
and whatnot. It's very similar to Metal Gear Solid VR missions.

03:47.420 --> 03:50.260
Does it seem to have anything in common with the original Intelligent Cube at all?

03:50.260 --> 03:53.820
It sorta looks the same, but other than that, no.

03:53.820 --> 03:56.700
Does it have, like, orchestra music? Because I remember Intelligent Cube had a very

03:56.700 --> 03:58.340
strange soundtrack. It was like all this, like,

03:58.340 --> 04:01.860
big orchestra music. Yeah, it's got pretty good music in it, so it's decent.

04:01.860 --> 04:04.900
More of the same, but I've been playing that a lot,

04:04.900 --> 04:08.660
and then, what was it, just recently I've been playing peek-a-boo poker

04:08.660 --> 04:13.980
on the Nintendo emulator which is

04:13.980 --> 04:17.940
one of the like three adult games for the

04:17.940 --> 04:21.580
Nintendo Entertainment System and it's very

04:21.580 --> 04:25.180
very craptastic but it's by the same people that did Bubble Bath Babes

04:25.180 --> 04:29.500
Bubble Bath Babes and Hot Slots so I have all three of those

04:29.500 --> 04:34.200
There are some winning games right there. I remember seeing Bubble Bath Babes back in the day in a

04:34.200 --> 04:35.340
rental store and I was like

04:35.340 --> 04:38.480
I'm gonna play that someday and I did and I was disappointed

04:39.280 --> 04:43.900
But then I played killer seven I progressed through another two levels and there's these one

04:45.040 --> 04:50.840
Smile heaven smile things you have to attack they have t-shirts and it's cool because you can just shoot them then they have like giant

04:50.840 --> 04:54.560
Smile, it's just this game right now. I thought you know progressing through it

04:54.560 --> 04:55.880
I'd figure out what's going on

04:55.880 --> 05:01.020
But the more and more I progress through the game the less and less I understand what's going on, but it's still fun

05:01.020 --> 05:03.020
I so I'm playing through it still

05:03.020 --> 05:06.780
All right, very cool anything else that's it. All right my gaming week

05:06.780 --> 05:10.540
I just got I mentioned this very briefly at the last at the end of the last podcast

05:10.540 --> 05:14.100
I just got a new television because my old one the

05:14.580 --> 05:19.140
RCA yellow thing was coming loose like and so my video kept fading in and out

05:19.140 --> 05:25.300
So I just finally decided to upgrade my TV and I went over to a big warehouse type store

05:25.300 --> 05:30.700
And I bought a 30 inch HD TV widescreen. So now I'm all about the widescreen games

05:30.700 --> 05:34.660
I'm like oh, I got to go back and play all these games because they're gonna look pretty and widescreen

05:34.660 --> 05:41.140
I got to find the ones have the good graphics, so I thought okay. I'm gonna play Halo 2. That's that's a very pretty looking game

05:41.900 --> 05:45.540
So I got on Halo 2 and I've been downloading the new maps and checking them out

05:45.540 --> 05:51.300
And I also got on and decided to play on Xbox Live again because they've been doing all these updates to the game lately

05:51.300 --> 05:55.500
So I thought I'd see if it played any differently and for someone like me who is a casual Halo 2 gamer

05:55.500 --> 06:00.540
I can't tell there's been any differences at all except for the new maps and the new maps you good idea keeps the game fresh

06:00.540 --> 06:06.580
So that's good. Um, one thing I did realize however, is that I am the worst Halo 2 player on the entire internet

06:07.100 --> 06:12.240
Seriously, I'm horrible. I've played several games and my ranking hasn't budged. That's how bad I am

06:12.500 --> 06:16.940
So if you ever see me in playing a Halo 2 match

06:17.060 --> 06:20.520
Feel free to make fun of me because I really am that bad at Halo 2. I apologize

06:20.940 --> 06:24.340
Other than that, I'm not I've just been playing kind of a lot of older games

06:24.340 --> 06:30.180
Just kind of rediscovering things and widescreen just playing with Xbox and going. Oh, I didn't know this game supported widescreen

06:30.180 --> 06:36.100
on all the little geeky techno things so no new games this week otherwise really

06:36.100 --> 06:40.540
all right let's get into some gaming news tonight and tonight I want to start

06:40.540 --> 06:44.100
off actually I should mention since I was talking about Halo 2 there actually

06:44.100 --> 06:49.340
was a new Halo 2 update this week they're calling it the ban hammer update

06:49.340 --> 06:54.260
basically what they're doing is that they are updating the game because there

06:54.260 --> 06:58.440
have been people that have been trying to mod Halo 2 and they can basically

06:58.440 --> 07:02.880
jump over ships pass through walls become invisible when you're not

07:02.880 --> 07:06.140
supposed to it's basically the same old thing people trying to hack the game

07:06.140 --> 07:09.000
that you're not supposed to is they can play online are they putting a sex

07:09.000 --> 07:13.500
minigame in Taylor no there was they were not hacking halo 2 to put a sex

07:13.500 --> 07:17.260
minigame in it but they were pissing off the people at bungee so they decided

07:17.260 --> 07:21.660
that hey we're gonna put this new patch out there and you're required to

07:21.660 --> 07:25.500
download it if you want to play online and I noticed this when I was playing

07:25.500 --> 07:31.140
Halo 2 online they've really started putting all these messages in the game that says hey like like, you know

07:31.140 --> 07:34.280
When you're waiting to join why I know you don't because you don't play Halo 2 Loki

07:34.280 --> 07:36.720
But when you're waiting to join a match on

07:36.940 --> 07:42.960
Halo 2 you get these little messages think of it as like the tip of the day like whenever you start a program like Photoshop

07:42.960 --> 07:45.900
You always get the tip of the day. We catch you cheating. You'll be dead

07:45.940 --> 07:51.580
That's basically what they've changed it to now. They have these little messages that go by they have the useful tips as well

07:51.580 --> 07:53.940
but then they have these things that go by going if

07:53.940 --> 08:00.280
cheating is not honored around here and we will ban your ass type things you

08:00.280 --> 08:03.480
know obviously they don't use that kind of language but you get the idea they're

08:03.480 --> 08:06.360
trying to put these little public service announcements that you know we

08:06.360 --> 08:10.300
catch you we ban you type things so they're just trying to curb the people

08:10.300 --> 08:14.720
that feel like they have to cheat to get ahead in Halo 2 because you know being

08:14.720 --> 08:18.600
the number one person on the Halo 2 leaderboard apparently wins you all this

08:18.600 --> 08:23.600
type of fame and fortune and all this stuff so every kid wants to be it I

08:23.600 --> 08:27.400
I don't know. I don't understand. Why would somebody want to cheat on Halo 2?

08:27.400 --> 08:31.440
It's fun. Just to get ahead. Nothing better to do. It's fun to get away with it.

08:31.440 --> 08:36.000
They use the internet for self-validation. Just like people in Final Fantasy 11 who are

08:36.000 --> 08:40.280
like teleporting themselves around. We have people on our link show to do that actually.

08:40.280 --> 08:44.400
Speaking of Final Fantasy 11, maybe for not much longer because they actually

08:44.400 --> 08:45.880
had a patch this week.

08:45.880 --> 08:49.160
Their patch actually had a little something to do with Chains of Promathia.

08:49.160 --> 08:50.120
They actually added

08:50.120 --> 08:53.480
a little more to the story in Chains of Promathia and they added some more

08:53.480 --> 08:56.760
uh... bosses so basically they're trying to wrap up the storyline there

08:56.760 --> 09:00.760
forty-three megabyte download for pc users is pretty big that's what i've

09:00.760 --> 09:04.920
quit that day i want to quit raining on the hunt for us to our parades

09:04.920 --> 09:06.560
what did you start playing again

09:06.560 --> 09:07.560
i'm thinking about it

09:07.560 --> 09:11.720
no no use i have here so with me i haven't played in a month miss none in a

09:11.720 --> 09:15.620
pia so i'm thinking about but i don't want to match

09:15.620 --> 09:17.760
yet but you have played again haven't played a month

09:17.760 --> 09:19.000
because uh...

09:19.000 --> 09:19.760
i

09:19.760 --> 09:22.920
the what the woman is uh... yelling at me

09:22.920 --> 09:26.180
with too much computer use she was comparing the computer to a woman today

09:26.180 --> 09:28.100
so I was like

09:28.100 --> 09:31.920
okay probably can't stay up and play Final Fantasy late

09:31.920 --> 09:34.860
well one thing that'll make the Final Fantasy fans happy this is actually

09:34.860 --> 09:37.400
something that made me happy because I've been waiting for them to do this for a

09:37.400 --> 09:41.400
long time and it is something that is making me consider going back but

09:41.400 --> 09:44.640
I'm not making any decisions until my work trips over next month but

09:44.640 --> 09:47.720
what they did is that they are going to uh...

09:47.720 --> 09:49.000
have some of these

09:49.000 --> 09:52.400
items that were selling for tons and tons of guild the leaping boots the

09:52.400 --> 09:57.680
Emperor's Hairpin now they're rare EX items so Gill sellers can't camp them

09:57.680 --> 10:01.640
anymore for Gill so of course they'll find other ways to make their money with

10:01.640 --> 10:05.280
the Gill selling but they're trying to at least curb that a little bit so very

10:05.280 --> 10:10.200
interesting by the way Squeenix what we call Square Enix they recently

10:10.200 --> 10:15.560
registered a brand new trademark it's called treasures of Ot Urgen hmm maybe a

10:15.560 --> 10:19.740
new Final Fantasy 11 expansion who knows there was actually two names that were

10:19.740 --> 10:23.820
registered no I didn't see the second one I heard that one I can't remember

10:23.820 --> 10:28.140
the other one hmm I'll have to look at it all right well either way rumors

10:28.140 --> 10:31.740
going around that with the Xbox 360 release we're gonna see a new expansion

10:31.740 --> 10:39.940
pack anyway so all right yeah yeah yeah cut it out all right let's open up the

10:39.940 --> 10:43.460
old mailbag we'll get into something dark Sakura might be interested in we'll

10:43.460 --> 10:47.660
go to the mailbag because lots of good ones we got some good mail this week in

10:47.660 --> 10:53.420
mailbag so I got more than what I actually boarded do you want to start

10:53.420 --> 10:56.520
off by reading one then or you want me to go to one go ahead all right I'm

10:56.520 --> 11:02.960
gonna start it off with an email this one came in from Rob Rob wanted to

11:02.960 --> 11:06.140
follow up with something that we were saying about the Silent Hill last week

11:06.140 --> 11:09.620
we're talking about Silent Hill for last week and somebody had been dogging on

11:09.620 --> 11:14.180
Silent Hill 3 I don't remember no you like Silent Hill 3 right dark soccer I

11:14.180 --> 11:17.620
think it might have been our emailer was dogging on it but Rob wanted to say that

11:17.620 --> 11:24.520
the PC version of Silent Hill 3 is a kazillion CDs but it's only $9.99 best of

11:24.520 --> 11:28.420
all it contains the Silent Hill 3 soundtrack I bought the soundtrack and

11:28.420 --> 11:33.520
got a game for free it's a good way to check it check both out so my response

11:33.520 --> 11:39.240
to him was if you buy Silent Hill 3 for the PlayStation 2 you get the soundtrack

11:39.240 --> 11:44.000
really yes but for PC it's only 10 bucks so how much is it on ps2 right now it's

11:44.000 --> 11:47.480
It's got to be at least a great chance, right?

11:47.480 --> 11:51.220
So either way, I like that when they throw in those bonuses like the soundtrack and things

11:51.220 --> 11:52.760
to get you to check the game out.

11:52.760 --> 11:54.360
That is pretty cool.

11:54.360 --> 11:59.960
And I just mentioned the other name that was out there, the Square Enix, registered was

11:59.960 --> 12:01.580
Scars of War.

12:01.580 --> 12:02.680
Thank you.

12:02.680 --> 12:04.680
That could be its own game though, probably.

12:04.680 --> 12:13.240
I also got another one from him, talking about how he was in Toys R Us the other day, and

12:13.240 --> 12:19.200
a six-year-old could understand that an M-rated game was for a teen and not for

12:19.200 --> 12:22.560
the kid but parents don't seem to understand that mm-hmm I think that's

12:22.560 --> 12:27.680
pretty funny in a very sad way yeah in a very sad way that the six-year-old

12:27.680 --> 12:32.520
understands the ratings better than his parents certainly I wanted to read

12:32.520 --> 12:38.080
another email here that came from let's see who is this person the brain trust

12:38.080 --> 12:41.880
was the person that sent this email and he was actually talking about the hot

12:41.880 --> 12:46.820
Coffee Mod, he talked a lot about that in the beginning of his email and he had an interesting

12:46.820 --> 12:53.320
perspective on that basically that he thought that video games overdo it sometimes.

12:53.320 --> 12:56.820
Like games like Manhunt, they overdo it and probably shouldn't even be made because they

12:56.820 --> 13:00.060
just overdo it basically.

13:00.060 --> 13:03.300
But what I thought was interesting is at the end of his email he said, he was listening

13:03.300 --> 13:07.920
to a podcast that we did on July 4th and we were commenting on the Left Behind game.

13:07.920 --> 13:11.080
He said, although I don't know if it will be a good game and don't care, although the

13:11.080 --> 13:14.320
premise has potential just to let you know the Christian community isn't all

13:14.320 --> 13:17.440
stupid in fact I don't know any Christians with a feeling that all games

13:17.440 --> 13:22.360
are evil the out-of-touch Christian stereotype doesn't fit anymore and you

13:22.360 --> 13:28.240
know that to the fundamentalists to that I say you know you're right I mean in

13:28.240 --> 13:31.440
when we are kind of poking fun at the whole thing and we're saying you know

13:31.440 --> 13:36.280
oh that the Christians think that these games are evil I'd like to think that

13:36.280 --> 13:41.440
that usually we preface it by saying that it's the extremist we're talking about in

13:41.440 --> 13:42.440
this case.

13:42.440 --> 13:44.280
The ones who actually publicly make the complaint.

13:44.280 --> 13:45.720
The 700 Club.

13:45.720 --> 13:50.520
Not every Christian is a crazy, foaming at the mouth, like crazy, I'm gonna ban games.

13:50.520 --> 13:57.000
Like the morons behind the chick tracks, you know, whoever has succeeded Jerry Falwell

13:57.000 --> 14:00.400
in his camp, you know, the fundamentalists.

14:00.400 --> 14:05.520
And I have some good friends who are Christians and I'm not, you know, I personally am not

14:05.520 --> 14:09.200
into that religion, but I have no problem... I went to church today!

14:09.200 --> 14:13.840
There you go! Besides, it's now, it's not really hip to make fun of Christian

14:13.840 --> 14:14.440
people, it's

14:14.440 --> 14:18.640
hip to make fun of Scientology. Oh yeah, that's true, we have a new religion to be making fun of.

14:18.640 --> 14:22.140
It's always been funny to make fun of Scientology. In all seriousness, and you can say this about

14:22.140 --> 14:26.040
any group of people, whether it be a religious group, an ethnic group,

14:26.040 --> 14:30.800
a, I don't know, whatever you come up with, a group of anybody, gamers even,

14:30.800 --> 14:35.000
there's always a few bad apples that ruin it for everyone. So when we poke fun,

14:35.000 --> 14:39.160
we're only poking fun at the extremists obviously there's plenty of great

14:39.160 --> 14:42.920
Christian folks I have friends that are Christians just like I have friends that

14:42.920 --> 14:46.760
are Buddhists and friends that are other religions and the great thing about the

14:46.760 --> 14:51.000
country where we live in playing the play the anthem is that you can have

14:51.000 --> 14:55.840
freedom of religion and choice and all that good enough for much longer

14:55.840 --> 15:00.600
yeah free remember the government voting in those conservatives that'll be gone

15:00.600 --> 15:04.000
real quick don't start the political thing or we're gonna get tons I'm not

15:04.000 --> 15:06.840
I'm not I'm not alright out Fox last night

15:07.360 --> 15:10.840
You got another email you want to read dark Sakura. I lost my place

15:11.360 --> 15:14.220
All right, I got another one then if you don't have one

15:14.840 --> 15:19.980
I wanted to read this one. This is cool. This was from a guy named Chris

15:19.980 --> 15:24.720
And he actually works on a site called a society wild card

15:25.360 --> 15:30.080
wants to say I wanted to thank you guys for providing an excellent entertaining and informative podcast

15:30.080 --> 15:34.160
amongst the mediocrity and crap that is swimming out there in the podcast ocean

15:34.160 --> 15:37.300
that's quite a compliment thank you no that's very cool no way to be talking

15:37.300 --> 15:42.720
about governor Schwarzenegger's podcast be nice I'm a filmmaker out here in

15:42.720 --> 15:45.940
Tampa Florida and I found the show while I was looking through podcast alley back

15:45.940 --> 15:48.940
in June and I've been listening ever since you know something weird about

15:48.940 --> 15:53.060
podcast alley it's not picking up our more recent shows ever since we went on

15:53.060 --> 15:57.940
to iTunes I'm not sure what's going on with that but I emailed them so please

15:57.940 --> 15:58.780
um...

15:58.780 --> 16:03.180
make sure you subscribe to the show via itunes or via ipod or some other form

16:03.180 --> 16:07.180
don't rely on necessarily uh... podcast alley

16:07.180 --> 16:11.020
although it's a great site i'm not gonna knock podcast is a great site and we

16:11.020 --> 16:14.580
have a lot of great people who voted for us over there as well

16:14.580 --> 16:18.240
it it's just really really big and they don't have time to work on you know each

16:18.240 --> 16:21.860
little individual podcast and its problems so you know he's given us a

16:21.860 --> 16:25.460
plug on his show i think it's only fair to do the same for him absolutely he's

16:25.460 --> 16:32.660
got a show you want to do if you go to the Chris show blogspot.com his podcast

16:32.660 --> 16:36.560
is available there all right sounds good and he says he's a filmmaker so I just

16:36.560 --> 16:40.100
want you to know that you know if you need a good actor I do all my own nude

16:40.100 --> 16:47.020
scenes just you know I have voice acting I have my kick-ass one-liners like

16:47.020 --> 16:52.020
podcasting it's so much fun all right you got any more emails for a

16:52.020 --> 16:58.180
I'll do one more I know I sent you a bunch I think we got most oh here was

16:58.180 --> 17:02.580
another one this here's one I'll read this one this would be the last one this

17:02.580 --> 17:07.340
one comes to us from Brian in Michigan and he says he's been listening to the

17:07.340 --> 17:12.140
podcast for a few weeks now thank you and he enjoys the discussion and our

17:12.140 --> 17:14.840
thoughts on the news that's interesting he likes the fact that we kind of talk

17:14.840 --> 17:17.440
about things we don't just kind of report report report so thank you we

17:17.440 --> 17:21.600
appreciate that also another vote for the drunken Loki episode he liked that

17:21.600 --> 17:28.080
so anyway what do you want it huh one more oh no I wonder I want to say the

17:28.080 --> 17:31.280
rest there's another part to this here he's got a suggestion for us how about

17:31.280 --> 17:35.880
some discussion on popular mods for PC games he says I don't think mods get

17:35.880 --> 17:39.740
enough air time and there are some great ones out there let's also not forget how

17:39.740 --> 17:43.960
many mods have become full games and how many modders have received jobs in the

17:43.960 --> 17:47.880
industry a very interesting point I have to admit unfortunately I don't play a

17:47.880 --> 17:52.540
a lot of PC games I do the most of my gaming on console not that I don't

17:52.540 --> 17:55.500
respect a lot of PC games out there I'm actually really looking forward to

17:55.500 --> 18:00.500
civilization 4 which by the way is supposed to be very mod friendly they're

18:00.500 --> 18:03.500
supposed to be building this whole programming language and they're gonna

18:03.500 --> 18:07.340
make it very mod friendly I think that's very cool Loki you would probably know

18:07.340 --> 18:10.780
more about the modding thing why don't you talk about the PC mod so much well I

18:10.780 --> 18:13.220
don't I don't play a lot of PC games anymore

18:13.220 --> 18:17.820
honestly what I've been playing maybe Grand Theft Auto a little bit I have

18:17.820 --> 18:22.620
hot coffee mod haven't actually played the hot coffee portion because getting the damn girlfriends

18:22.620 --> 18:26.700
to actually understand you and like you know you have to take them out on dates and it's really

18:26.700 --> 18:31.980
hard because they want to go do drive-bys and and they end up dying a lot of times they get shot in

18:31.980 --> 18:37.100
the head and you're like oh your girlfriend's dead oh damn you know but so i don't do that instead

18:37.100 --> 18:41.420
what i do is i download even more mods like the spider car mod where you can drive cars up walls

18:41.420 --> 18:46.780
just crazy stuff like actually doing my own modding where you just adjust the aspects of

18:46.780 --> 18:48.680
of different cars and stuff.

18:48.680 --> 18:49.960
But there's some pretty cool ones.

18:49.960 --> 18:53.360
Like there's one for, I think it was Unreal or whatever,

18:53.360 --> 18:56.880
or Quake, the Enter the Tube or whatever like that,

18:56.880 --> 18:59.400
the Penny Arcade mod that they had for that,

18:59.400 --> 19:00.500
that was pretty cool.

19:01.440 --> 19:03.120
Just, there's a lot of mods out there,

19:03.120 --> 19:05.760
but unfortunately, you know, I don't play a lot of them.

19:05.760 --> 19:07.200
It's just not in the budget for us

19:07.200 --> 19:08.920
to be getting a lot of PC games.

19:08.920 --> 19:13.000
The last mod I ever did was Gatchamon Quake.

19:13.000 --> 19:17.000
Now, Quake was almost ten years ago, so it's old.

19:17.000 --> 19:21.000
Quake Rally, where they turn that game into a racing game.

19:21.000 --> 19:25.000
But some of those like that get adopted and get huge followings to them.

19:25.000 --> 19:29.000
If any game publishers out there want to send us some

19:29.000 --> 19:33.000
free games, and we will definitely look into how the internet is modding your game on the PC,

19:33.000 --> 19:37.000
we'll certainly talk about it on the show. Drop us an email, togo

19:37.000 --> 19:41.000
togo.com, and you should do that anyway if you have

19:41.000 --> 19:44.440
any general comments on the show you got one more email for us we had one from

19:44.440 --> 19:49.480
someone named Spencer just talking about the music games one of our opinions on

19:49.480 --> 19:54.680
rocks or red octane mad cats and he's a apparently an indigo fan but I have to

19:54.680 --> 19:57.480
say that if you really want our true opinion on the music games you should

19:57.480 --> 20:01.200
probably check out our live show that's true we do do talk about it for three

20:01.200 --> 20:06.140
hours well that's kind of a loose term that we are a train wreck we talk

20:06.140 --> 20:10.080
strictly about the music games we do do a live show on orange launch radio.com

20:10.080 --> 20:15.840
For three hours every Sunday night and you can hear Loki really rip on in a groove because he doesn't care for the game

20:16.280 --> 20:18.160
and I will

20:18.160 --> 20:23.240
Second that because in the groove is kind of but I I on the other hand. I'm not bothered by in the groove

20:23.240 --> 20:27.880
I think it does some good things for the dance game community for those who don't know what in the groove is

20:27.880 --> 20:35.000
It's kind of controversial in the music game scene because it was a game that look it was made by fans of dance dance revolution

20:35.000 --> 20:40.280
who were sad to see the Dance Dance Revolution stopped in Japan with the

20:40.280 --> 20:43.160
release of Dance Dance Revolution Extreme a couple years ago so they made

20:43.160 --> 20:48.600
their own game that had some new ideas some original music etc but it's kind of

20:48.600 --> 20:51.560
one of those things that got really you want to talk about mods to get blown out

20:51.560 --> 20:55.080
of proportion this was something that got way way way too big and now it has a

20:55.080 --> 21:02.320
home release and it's so basically it's just very controversial I like in the

21:02.320 --> 21:06.040
groove somewhat I like some of the things that it brings to the table like

21:06.040 --> 21:10.180
I like some of some of the music in the game I think mines when used

21:10.180 --> 21:14.320
appropriately is an interesting new twist on the dance game but there's a

21:14.320 --> 21:17.580
lot of things I don't like about it and a lot of it has to do with the online

21:17.580 --> 21:22.000
community I hate to say it I but I just really hope you're not one of these guys

21:22.000 --> 21:27.660
that's online saying you know oh DDR is dead and DDR sucks because in the groove

21:27.660 --> 21:32.940
owns everything. Okay, In the Groove does one-up DDR on some things, but they will

21:32.940 --> 21:36.260
not have existed without DDR. Yeah, we have to can't forget that In the Groove

21:36.260 --> 21:41.020
would not exist without DDR, and the fact that DDR is not dead, it's got plenty of

21:41.020 --> 21:45.180
home releases still coming out, including Xtreme 2, UltraMix 3 coming out later

21:45.180 --> 21:48.460
this year. And again, not to dog on the scene as a whole, because I know some

21:48.460 --> 21:51.500
really nice people in the In the Groove scene, but just some of the message

21:51.500 --> 21:57.060
boards really ruffle my feathers. I too got an email, but it was something

21:57.060 --> 22:04.940
funny, it was referring back to the episode in which I mentioned how games help the kids,

22:04.940 --> 22:10.620
you know, fight with diseases, and I mentioned Tumor Raider, and someone sent me a Clarisworks

22:10.620 --> 22:15.540
file, and if I remember correctly, I think Clarisworks is a Mac, you know, it's something

22:15.540 --> 22:21.340
that runs on an Apple PC, fortunately I do not, you know, I do not have such inferior

22:21.340 --> 22:22.340
PCs.

22:22.340 --> 22:23.980
And we're not even going into this next story.

22:23.980 --> 22:26.700
Not start the Apple versus PC thing again.

22:26.700 --> 22:30.700
Because we do not need to hear the closed-minded speak out of his ass.

22:30.700 --> 22:32.700
Alright.

22:32.700 --> 22:33.700
Moving on.

22:33.700 --> 22:34.700
Hey, I have some fun news.

22:34.700 --> 22:35.700
You have a fun news?

22:35.700 --> 22:36.700
What do you want to tell us about?

22:36.700 --> 22:37.700
Not really fun.

22:37.700 --> 22:38.700
It's really depressing.

22:38.700 --> 22:39.700
Alright.

22:39.700 --> 22:41.700
Can we play the happy music again?

22:41.700 --> 22:42.700
Yeah.

22:42.700 --> 22:43.700
No.

22:43.700 --> 22:44.700
No.

22:44.700 --> 22:45.700
This would be horrible.

22:45.700 --> 22:46.700
Alright.

22:46.700 --> 22:47.700
No.

22:47.700 --> 22:48.700
Read the story.

22:48.700 --> 22:49.700
Alright.

22:49.700 --> 22:50.700
Read the story.

22:50.700 --> 22:56.260
A 12-year-old named Gary Lloyd, apparently in London, hung himself.

22:56.260 --> 23:02.220
After his mother took away his Playstation, it turned out to be he was doing it to get

23:02.220 --> 23:06.100
attention and his little prank went wrong.

23:06.100 --> 23:11.820
So any childrens listening to the show, if your mom takes away your Playstation, don't

23:11.820 --> 23:13.460
hang yourself cause you'll die.

23:13.460 --> 23:15.460
Yeah, try going outside.

23:15.460 --> 23:16.460
Or do something else.

23:16.460 --> 23:21.860
Yeah, there's like a world out there with air and birds and stuff.

23:21.860 --> 23:25.500
All he needed was just an extra life.

23:25.500 --> 23:26.500
So wrong.

23:26.500 --> 23:27.500
So wrong.

23:27.500 --> 23:28.500
Wah wah wah.

23:28.500 --> 23:29.500
Boo!

23:29.500 --> 23:30.500
But it is pretty crappy.

23:30.500 --> 23:31.500
Just... kids...

23:31.500 --> 23:32.500
I didn't...

23:32.500 --> 23:36.940
Half of me wants to say it's Darwinism at work.

23:36.940 --> 23:37.940
Hey.

23:37.940 --> 23:38.940
The other half.

23:38.940 --> 23:39.940
There's something else going on here.

23:39.940 --> 23:40.940
I'll have you know.

23:40.940 --> 23:42.500
Grand Theft Auto does not have hangings.

23:42.500 --> 23:46.620
Texas does though.

23:46.620 --> 23:53.260
Moving on, speaking of Grand Theft Auto and like stories, we have a story about the Miami

23:53.260 --> 23:55.100
Attorney Jack Thompson.

23:55.100 --> 23:58.100
Maybe you know this guy, he's crazy!

23:58.100 --> 24:02.560
He's foaming at the mouth crazy when it comes to wanting to rip video games a new one for

24:02.560 --> 24:03.560
being too violent.

24:03.560 --> 24:05.300
Well guess what game he's going after now?

24:05.300 --> 24:06.300
Sims 2!

24:06.300 --> 24:12.140
Yes, he says that naked people in the Sims 2 is just horrible.

24:12.140 --> 24:16.860
Here's a quote, Sims 2, the latest version of the Sims video game franchise, contains,

24:16.860 --> 24:21.580
according to the video game news sites, full frontal nudity, including nipples, penises,

24:21.580 --> 24:22.900
labia, and pubic hair.

24:22.900 --> 24:24.380
Okay, come on, that's pathetic.

24:24.380 --> 24:27.580
I just wanted to say all those words on a podcast.

24:27.580 --> 24:28.580
No it doesn't.

24:28.580 --> 24:32.740
It's the mod that put that on there.

24:32.740 --> 24:37.020
I think there's a big, big difference between what's going on here and what's going on with

24:37.020 --> 24:38.180
Grand Theft Auto.

24:38.180 --> 24:42.580
I call what happened with Grand Theft Auto San Andreas and the whole hot coffee thing

24:42.580 --> 24:43.980
lazy programming.

24:43.980 --> 24:51.460
The reason being, and we've seen this happen before with DDR, because Dark Soccer Loki

24:51.460 --> 24:54.180
myself been talking about DDR for years, so we've been following the

24:54.180 --> 24:59.580
franchise, and when it had a release on the PlayStation, its very first release,

24:59.580 --> 25:04.460
some hackers found on the disc a background for the song Bad Girls where

25:04.460 --> 25:06.580
somebody had airbrushed out the gun.

25:06.580 --> 25:10.180
So it makes it look like that they had prepped that song to be ready for US

25:10.180 --> 25:11.060
audiences,

25:11.060 --> 25:14.940
but they took the song out at the last minute. Or if you even want to go more recent, DDR

25:14.940 --> 25:15.700
Extreme,

25:15.700 --> 25:19.660
where they had a completely, a song that wasn't even in the game, but you could

25:19.660 --> 25:22.940
play that's right you had memories remember that memories is completely in

25:22.940 --> 25:26.980
the game and with hack codes you could hack your memory card file to play

25:26.980 --> 25:30.460
memories on DDR extreme even though the song wasn't supposed to be there for

25:30.460 --> 25:33.900
whatever reason at the last minute they took it out but what do they take out

25:33.900 --> 25:37.860
they don't it's a pain in the butt I guess for compiling or whatever reasons

25:37.860 --> 25:41.900
I'm not a programmer but it's a pain in the butt to take out the entire chunk of

25:41.900 --> 25:46.500
game it's easier to take out the little pointer that points to that file and the

25:46.500 --> 25:49.380
Because you know all these games work on a giant flow chart

25:49.380 --> 25:52.260
It's easier to take out the pointer that says play this song

25:52.300 --> 25:58.260
So that's what I think happened with Grand Theft Auto that Rockstar had every intention of doing this sex thing

25:58.260 --> 26:03.160
But at the last minute they somebody thought you know what maybe this is a little much

26:03.340 --> 26:05.580
So instead of taking the whole thing out of the game

26:05.700 --> 26:10.060
What did they take out they took out the pointer and when the PC version came out?

26:10.060 --> 26:12.940
It was exposed that the hot coffee thing was in there

26:12.940 --> 26:17.380
somebody put the pointer back in and sure enough PlayStation and Xbox versions

26:17.380 --> 26:21.700
the pointers they figure out how to put it back in Rockstar has to admit yes the

26:21.700 --> 26:24.780
sex thing was in the game the whole time but they didn't intend on it being

26:24.780 --> 26:28.620
discovered and I believe it that they probably had taken the pointers out not

26:28.620 --> 26:34.060
realizing it's lazy programming I call it so but now with the Sims that's not

26:34.060 --> 26:37.500
you don't have a pointer or at least with the Sims 2 I rumor is in the

26:37.500 --> 26:40.500
original Sims I didn't play enough of the Sims but there actually was a code

26:40.500 --> 26:44.500
where you could undo the blur or whatever, but it's a patch, it's another mod.

26:44.500 --> 26:48.500
But the thing is, is that even under the blur there was no detail.

26:48.500 --> 26:51.500
All it is is another skin that has the detail.

26:51.500 --> 26:57.500
Right, and even, there was actually a quote, Jeff Brown, Vice President of Corporate Communications at EA says,

26:57.500 --> 27:03.500
This is nonsense. We've reviewed 100% of the content. There is no content inappropriate for a teen audience.

27:03.500 --> 27:08.500
Players never see a nude sim. If someone with an extreme amount of expertise and time were to remove the pixels,

27:08.500 --> 27:12.300
the pixels they would see that the Sims have no genitals they appear like Ken

27:12.300 --> 27:15.700
and Barbie what they're talking about though is the nude sim patches where

27:15.700 --> 27:19.960
people have actually modified because in The Sims 2 you can actually modify your

27:19.960 --> 27:23.860
character and so they added that stuff in but the thing is is and they're this

27:23.860 --> 27:27.060
guy's like going oh well they're just letting that happen yeah they want

27:27.060 --> 27:32.020
people to make mods so you can make new clothing you can make new items etc

27:32.020 --> 27:34.260
because that stuff they have whole communities built around that where you

27:34.260 --> 27:37.060
can buy new skins you can make characters that look like Austin Powers

27:37.060 --> 27:41.740
On the Sims 2 site themselves, they offer a mod of the month, basically.

27:41.740 --> 27:44.940
Right, but they would not highlight a nude patch as the mod of the month.

27:44.940 --> 27:45.940
They have that kind of space.

27:45.940 --> 27:46.940
Well, no!

27:46.940 --> 27:50.220
And they have like houses, you can buy houses and bring them in or whatever.

27:50.220 --> 27:52.780
But that same thing's been going on for years.

27:52.780 --> 27:53.780
Remember Tomb Raider?

27:53.780 --> 27:57.620
They had the nude Laura patch within six months of the game coming out, and where was this

27:57.620 --> 27:58.620
guy then?

27:58.620 --> 27:59.620
He doesn't do his research.

27:59.620 --> 28:00.660
That's clearly what it is.

28:00.660 --> 28:01.740
He doesn't do his research.

28:01.740 --> 28:02.940
So take this one to court.

28:02.940 --> 28:04.340
They'll just, they're gonna nail you in the ass.

28:04.340 --> 28:09.540
I think that's what they're gonna find the difference is and I hope somebody sits down in front of Congress and explain this to them

28:09.540 --> 28:13.180
You can't control what the people on the internet are gonna do to the code of the game

28:13.940 --> 28:17.580
But in the case of Grand Theft Auto, I think it was a lazy pointer programming thing

28:17.780 --> 28:20.860
But even still though even still if that was the case

28:20.860 --> 28:27.620
This shouldn't have even gone as far as it was even if it was lazy program because there's been it's stupid. It's really dumb

28:27.620 --> 28:31.960
I think all all games are gonna suffer because of this not necessarily content wise but

28:31.960 --> 28:34.120
that programmers aren't gonna be so lazy anymore

28:34.120 --> 28:35.520
and they're gonna push back the release dates

28:35.520 --> 28:36.800
of their games so they can clean up,

28:36.800 --> 28:38.920
clean out the code so you people don't find them.

28:38.920 --> 28:40.320
You know what's gonna suffer?

28:40.320 --> 28:41.580
Pre-expression.

28:41.580 --> 28:43.160
That's what's gonna suffer.

28:43.160 --> 28:44.400
You know, it's kind of funny though

28:44.400 --> 28:46.440
because there are a lot of lazy programmers out there.

28:46.440 --> 28:48.120
There's like, what is it?

28:48.120 --> 28:50.440
One of the Dance Dance Revolution games,

28:50.440 --> 28:52.540
they sometimes, they used to have these things

28:52.540 --> 28:54.760
like dummy files that would like,

28:54.760 --> 28:57.100
they would put on the disc to fill up space or whatever

28:57.100 --> 28:59.500
so it'd make them harder to rip or whatever.

28:59.500 --> 29:04.780
One of the Dance Dance Revolution games, I think it was Max 2, had the entire source

29:04.780 --> 29:06.940
code for BeatMania 5 on it.

29:06.940 --> 29:08.820
Oh, I'd heard about that.

29:08.820 --> 29:09.820
It's a zip file.

29:09.820 --> 29:12.520
It's like, oh, that was pretty dumb.

29:12.520 --> 29:18.300
But there's a lot of lazy programming stuff out there, but just honestly, I don't know

29:18.300 --> 29:20.680
why this is such an issue.

29:20.680 --> 29:23.860
But you know what, they want to make this an example just like they made Janet Jackson

29:23.860 --> 29:25.540
an example in the whole TV thing.

29:25.540 --> 29:28.220
They've got their own agendas, they want some way to do it, and they're going to find a

29:28.220 --> 29:29.220
way to do it.

29:29.220 --> 29:32.060
The moral movements thing of the week, basically.

29:32.060 --> 29:33.060
It's retarded.

29:33.060 --> 29:34.060
Alright.

29:34.060 --> 29:35.700
More like moral bowel movement.

29:35.700 --> 29:40.180
I'm gonna let Dark Soccer get into some UK news, but first I wanted to give a story that's

29:40.180 --> 29:43.500
kind of UK related, a little miniature story here.

29:43.500 --> 29:46.980
Konami's gonna be publishing a game based on Wallace and Gromit, because they're gonna

29:46.980 --> 29:51.740
be having a movie coming out, The Curse of the Were-Rabbit, I actually saw the trailer

29:51.740 --> 29:55.380
when I went and saw Charlie and Chocolate Factory again this week.

29:55.380 --> 29:58.460
Wallace and Gromit, Konami's gonna be putting out the game, it's going to follow the events

29:58.460 --> 30:02.620
of the movie basically the plot is that you know Wallace and his dog gromit are

30:02.620 --> 30:08.180
called on to protect a giant vegetable contest from a beastly terror you can

30:08.180 --> 30:11.940
use cooperative gameplay in the game playing as Wallace or gromit or their

30:11.940 --> 30:16.500
rabbit friend named hutch should be interesting dark soccer what's going on

30:16.500 --> 30:20.840
in the UK for our friends overseas well actually this is more of an

30:20.840 --> 30:27.500
international thing about hiranobu Sakaguchi you know Final Fantasy creator

30:27.500 --> 30:30.840
basically is saying that he's got a couple games

30:30.840 --> 30:35.020
in works on the Xbox 360 however they will not be playable at the Tokyo Game

30:35.020 --> 30:35.940
Show in September

30:35.940 --> 30:39.420
Oh interesting. But

30:39.420 --> 30:43.060
they are basically making progress on it

30:43.060 --> 30:46.460
they're getting the graphics in order it's just been slow progress

30:46.460 --> 30:49.860
Want my Final Fantasy 12 dammit

30:49.860 --> 30:52.780
also in news

30:52.780 --> 31:02.180
Archer McLean, he was the creative director at Awesome Studios, they actually were the company that put out Mercury, and he resigned.

31:02.780 --> 31:07.780
But said that overall he was really more of a figurehead, so it's not really a major loss.

31:08.480 --> 31:14.280
And Loki, your review on Mercury pretty much convinced me not to buy the game, so I guess this is no big loss.

31:14.280 --> 31:19.880
It wasn't that great of a game. It was okay, it was sort of different, but I got bored with it really quick.

31:19.880 --> 31:21.480
What could they have done to make the game better?

31:21.480 --> 31:27.160
Just, I was expecting something sort of like Marble Madness. The mazes were too short, and it was just very...

31:27.880 --> 31:32.840
It was just, a lot of levels that were really short, and it just didn't do it for me. It was just kind of a pain in the butt.

31:34.080 --> 31:38.440
Now, the last thing is a game I haven't heard much on, uh, coming out for the US market.

31:38.840 --> 31:42.600
I'm sure it will, but it's called Another Code to Memories.

31:43.320 --> 31:45.960
Basically, it's sort of like a combination of, uh,

31:45.960 --> 31:50.720
interactive sim you know kind of dating Sims were except you also have a little

31:50.720 --> 31:54.960
map where you guide somebody through a house and your puzzle you have puzzles

31:54.960 --> 31:57.760
to get them through this house so you're using both screens one for your

31:57.760 --> 32:02.560
communication with a ghost and the other to navigate so it's supposed to be a

32:02.560 --> 32:09.080
little semi survival horror puzzle game it looks pretty cool very cool sounds

32:09.080 --> 32:10.460
That's good.

32:10.460 --> 32:13.580
All right, let's move on to some other news

32:13.580 --> 32:16.300
talking about Xbox Live.

32:16.300 --> 32:17.980
There was actually a story posted on,

32:17.980 --> 32:19.900
I'm not sure if this is Gamasutra.

32:19.900 --> 32:21.420
I always want to say Gamasutra

32:21.420 --> 32:23.700
so it can rhyme with the book, you know?

32:23.700 --> 32:25.500
But I think it's Gamasutra.

32:25.500 --> 32:27.100
They ran a story earlier this week

32:27.100 --> 32:29.020
that says that Microsoft is announcing

32:29.020 --> 32:32.740
two million Xbox Live subscribers.

32:32.740 --> 32:34.460
The last time that they had made an announcement

32:34.460 --> 32:38.860
was back in January, 1.4 million users at that point.

32:38.860 --> 32:43.580
This growth rate, by the way, would be the equivalent of one new Xbox Live member every

32:43.580 --> 32:45.660
30 seconds.

32:45.660 --> 32:51.580
I'm kind of surprised that Xbox Live is still growing so rapidly, but I guess Halo 2 has

32:51.580 --> 32:54.780
a large part to do with that, but it just doesn't seem like there's been a whole lot

32:54.780 --> 32:56.380
of really, like, just...

32:56.380 --> 32:58.140
The hype of the 360.

32:58.140 --> 33:02.820
Also some of the new games include the free two month trial as well.

33:02.820 --> 33:05.100
Like Evident Rising had a two month trial in it, so...

33:05.100 --> 33:06.580
Okay, I can see that, I can see that.

33:06.580 --> 33:08.920
And plus, with the console coming down in price,

33:08.920 --> 33:11.800
it makes Xbox, like I didn't buy Xbox when it was first out.

33:11.800 --> 33:13.680
It wasn't until they slashed them to 200 bucks

33:13.680 --> 33:15.520
when I finally decided to pick one up.

33:15.520 --> 33:18.360
So I guess that helps kinda motivate sales as well.

33:18.360 --> 33:19.880
Very interesting.

33:19.880 --> 33:21.320
By the way, also in this article,

33:21.320 --> 33:23.380
the company mentions what titles are gonna be out

33:23.380 --> 33:26.000
for Xbox Live and Xbox 360 Live

33:26.000 --> 33:28.360
that will be out before the end of the year.

33:28.360 --> 33:31.520
Online playable titles for Xbox 360 include

33:31.520 --> 33:35.160
Perfect Dark Zero, Project Gotham Racing 3,

33:35.160 --> 33:40.160
Madden NFL 06, Dead or Alive 4, and Call of Duty 2.

33:40.520 --> 33:42.120
Some games for the current Xbox

33:42.120 --> 33:43.980
that will be enabled on Xbox Live.

33:43.980 --> 33:48.040
Star Wars Battlefront 2, Tony Hawk American Wasteland,

33:48.040 --> 33:50.060
Battlefield 2, Modern Combat.

33:50.060 --> 33:52.240
So for those Xbox fans, some games,

33:52.240 --> 33:53.360
a lot of sequels in there,

33:53.360 --> 33:55.280
so some games to look forward to.

33:55.280 --> 33:56.720
I think Dead or Alive will be cool.

33:56.720 --> 33:57.560
Dead or Alive 4.

33:57.560 --> 33:59.400
American Wasteland's gonna be pretty cool too.

33:59.400 --> 34:01.960
It's like Tony Hawk Underground, but free roaming.

34:02.840 --> 34:04.240
Some all one huge level.

34:04.240 --> 34:06.720
Some of those clips of Dead or Alive 4, though, look so great.

34:06.720 --> 34:09.780
And I've not usually been a really huge Dead or Alive fan,

34:09.780 --> 34:11.280
but Dead or Alive 4 looks pretty hot.

34:11.280 --> 34:13.480
I want to see the Dead or Alive movie.

34:13.480 --> 34:14.720
All right.

34:14.720 --> 34:16.320
Moving on.

34:16.320 --> 34:20.720
Also another game being teased this week, Resident Evil 5.

34:20.720 --> 34:25.040
The website Gamefront had some scans of the publication,

34:25.040 --> 34:29.100
Famitsu, which gave some news this week on Resident Evil 5.

34:29.100 --> 34:30.840
The interesting thing about Resident Evil 5,

34:30.840 --> 34:34.000
remember how Resident Evil 4 was GameCube only,

34:34.000 --> 34:40.000
at least in the beginning, Resident Evil 5 will only be on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360

34:40.000 --> 34:41.560
when it first comes out.

34:41.560 --> 34:45.060
Nintendo's getting the shaft, but I say this is because Nintendo is being so secretive

34:45.060 --> 34:46.060
with their revolution.

34:46.060 --> 34:49.760
Yeah, because they haven't released their system yet, and the system's like, uhhh, it'll

34:49.760 --> 34:50.760
come out sometime.

34:50.760 --> 34:55.000
I have a feeling Resident Evil 5 will make its way to the revolution, but because Nintendo

34:55.000 --> 34:56.000
is releasing it later.

34:56.000 --> 35:00.320
Well honestly, I haven't even heard if the Nintendo Revolution dev kits have even gone

35:00.320 --> 35:06.240
out yet so well can't really make a game without that so well very interesting

35:06.240 --> 35:10.200
also the trailer up for this to look pretty cool the speculation from the

35:10.200 --> 35:14.720
early screenshots say that Chris Redfield who was in Resident Evil 1 and

35:14.720 --> 35:19.560
Code Veronica looks to be the main character in this next game it looks

35:19.560 --> 35:24.140
like the over-the-shoulder style from Resident Evil 4 will be coming back in

35:24.140 --> 35:28.720
this game as well at least in some way but what was surprising from the early

35:28.720 --> 35:32.860
screenshots the game appears to be a little brighter like a little more happy

35:32.860 --> 35:36.280
brighter warm colors than previous Resident Evil games so should be

35:36.280 --> 35:42.340
interesting all right now we here at orange lounge radio we're not just here

35:42.340 --> 35:46.380
to talk about video games 24-7 because if we talked about video games all day

35:46.380 --> 35:52.900
long we'd have no time to go out and enjoy fine dining and wine and cheese

35:52.900 --> 35:58.860
tasting and to get interviewed yes so as part of bettering your life we have the

35:58.860 --> 36:03.460
one and only dark Sakura here to present her advice column so dark Sakura what

36:03.460 --> 36:08.380
advice do you have for our listeners tonight today's bit of advice is how to

36:08.380 --> 36:17.060
sober up fast which actually all of us can use one avoid pills do not take

36:17.060 --> 36:20.580
ibuprofen acetaminophen or aspirin just before during or after drinking

36:20.580 --> 36:25.140
Acetic medicine can cause liver damage in conjunction with alcohol, ibuprofen can cause

36:25.140 --> 36:31.140
severe stomach irritation, and aspirin thins the blood, which may exacerbate a hangover.

36:31.140 --> 36:32.140
2.

36:32.140 --> 36:36.980
Drink a lot of fluids.

36:36.980 --> 36:41.420
Dehydration from alcohol can be treated with water, sweet juices, or sports drinks.

36:41.420 --> 36:45.620
Potassium also helps you overcome the shaky feeling of a bad hangover.

36:45.620 --> 36:46.620
3.

36:46.620 --> 36:47.620
Take vitamins.

36:47.620 --> 36:51.460
Vitamin or vitamin B complex can be used to combat vitamin depletion.

36:51.460 --> 36:54.580
And when you drink, vitamin B is the first thing to go.

36:54.580 --> 36:55.580
4.

36:55.580 --> 36:56.580
Eat starchy food.

36:56.580 --> 36:57.860
Lots of it.

36:57.860 --> 36:58.860
5.

36:58.860 --> 37:00.780
Rest or sleep for as long as possible.

37:00.780 --> 37:01.780
6.

37:01.780 --> 37:05.620
Repeat steps 2 through 5 if you wake up with a hangover.

37:05.620 --> 37:09.700
But my number one bit of advice on how to sober up fast?

37:09.700 --> 37:13.340
Don't go to any Rob's parties.

37:13.340 --> 37:17.380
Don't use the double shot glass to make double shot drinks.

37:17.380 --> 37:21.980
guys appreciate your support all right you know what just for that you get a

37:21.980 --> 37:27.860
story about you Ebola just for that dungeon siege is the next movie that's

37:27.860 --> 37:32.740
going to be coming out Ray Liotta was just signed for dungeon siege the movie

37:32.740 --> 37:37.980
he'll be playing a villainous character in the game that's his title die

37:37.980 --> 37:42.700
villainous characters die isn't the name of the main character farmer or something

37:42.700 --> 37:49.700
like that. It's kind of dorky. Alright. That'd be like what in the Trogdor game, Peasants

37:50.220 --> 37:55.940
Quest. That's enough about UiBowl. Loki, what's going on in the hack and crack scene? Well,

37:55.940 --> 38:01.120
there's some interesting stuff that should put a damper on the homebrew scene. PSP Firmware

38:01.120 --> 38:06.700
2.0 was announced at the Playstation Conference just this week, and Playstation 2.0 will be

38:06.700 --> 38:11.380
adding the elusive internet browser. That's right folks, you can actually be able to browse

38:11.380 --> 38:16.260
internet without having to have wipeout. So let me think, Sony realized that people

38:16.260 --> 38:20.260
were hacking their way into getting a web browser so they thought, gee, a good idea

38:20.260 --> 38:23.260
to curb this would be to just release our own web browser.

38:23.260 --> 38:28.420
But what's cool about their web browser, it supports everything from HTML 4.01 or whatever

38:28.420 --> 38:34.380
that means, except for Flash, no Flash. Good, we won't get those annoying shoot the

38:34.380 --> 38:37.620
villain to buy an iPod, or to win an iPod stupid thing.

38:37.620 --> 38:41.300
But you can download, the other thing is that they have TV Now, which is this new thing

38:41.300 --> 38:45.260
that they're coming out with, so basically you can download TV episodes off of this one

38:45.260 --> 38:46.260
website.

38:46.260 --> 38:50.340
Again, finding something that people are using their PSP for is on the internet, and making

38:50.340 --> 38:51.340
it legit.

38:51.340 --> 38:52.420
Smart idea, people.

38:52.420 --> 38:56.900
Hopefully this will be able to, you'll hopefully be able to download MP3s, which, download

38:56.900 --> 39:01.160
our podcasts, you know, without having to, you know, do anything special.

39:01.160 --> 39:02.900
Find a wifi spot, download podcasts.

39:02.900 --> 39:03.900
Go!

39:03.900 --> 39:04.900
Very interesting.

39:04.900 --> 39:08.100
An eye-potter for the PSP would be cool.

39:08.100 --> 39:12.160
Very cool. What I'm wondering is this only in Japan or is this actually gonna

39:12.160 --> 39:13.220
happen here, the TV thing?

39:13.220 --> 39:17.660
The TV thing right now I think is only in Japan. The version 2.0 is supposed to launch

39:17.660 --> 39:20.860
in Japan on July 27th, so next week,

39:20.860 --> 39:26.100
and also they're gonna be launching a brand new color PSP, white,

39:26.100 --> 39:28.900
which is coming out September 21st, and that's gonna be...

39:28.900 --> 39:29.900
Original white.

39:29.900 --> 39:33.600
Ceramic white. I'm sorry. And it's gonna be coming out,

39:33.600 --> 39:40.900
It's gonna be with firmware 2.0 on there, so you can't run the homebrew games, but you've got an internet browser

39:40.900 --> 39:46.100
So but how long before they hack the 2.0 you think oh, it's gone there what they're gonna

39:46.100 --> 39:51.520
Do is they're gonna take the PSP they're gonna take the firmware update rip the browser right out of there, and they'll be in there

39:52.220 --> 39:58.180
New applications are becoming long though because they accidentally reveal them firmware 2.0 on the internet

39:58.380 --> 40:01.260
And some people downloaded it and it crashed their PSPs

40:01.260 --> 40:06.220
But, they're going to be having a calculator, a word processor, and I think a day planner

40:06.220 --> 40:07.220
calculator.

40:07.220 --> 40:08.540
Oh, word processor on your PSP?

40:08.540 --> 40:09.540
Word processor.

40:09.540 --> 40:10.540
Well, the thing is...

40:10.540 --> 40:13.380
So that means there has to be a keyboard attachment coming out.

40:13.380 --> 40:15.300
Yeah, that's what I was just about to say.

40:15.300 --> 40:21.120
Keyboard support is now being added with the PSP, I think, via their IR or USB adapter

40:21.120 --> 40:22.120
type thing.

40:22.120 --> 40:24.020
So, there's going to be a PSP keyboard coming out.

40:24.020 --> 40:26.620
Okay, so that's all the wonderful official stuff that's going on.

40:26.620 --> 40:30.580
Of course, we don't really want to know about the official stuff, we want to talk about

40:30.580 --> 40:33.260
Well, I found the official stuff to be interesting for once.

40:33.260 --> 40:34.260
Okay, fine.

40:34.260 --> 40:35.260
Talk about the unofficial stuff.

40:35.260 --> 40:36.900
The unofficial stuff.

40:36.900 --> 40:42.620
Brand new loaders have been released, the new hook loader and the We Are Back group

40:42.620 --> 40:43.980
has released another loader.

40:43.980 --> 40:48.740
These ones bypassing the update checks and now running overclock stuff and running the

40:48.740 --> 40:57.060
full library files so you can have all this wonderful wifi and music and everything.

40:57.060 --> 41:01.980
It's only a matter of time before 3.0 comes out and everything runs.

41:01.980 --> 41:03.500
It's not going to matter anymore.

41:03.500 --> 41:05.740
So I just thought I'd mention that.

41:05.740 --> 41:11.260
Also you know, upgrades to your favorite emulators, Super Nintendo 9X is now running almost full

41:11.260 --> 41:12.260
speed.

41:12.260 --> 41:13.260
Ooh, I gotta check that out.

41:13.260 --> 41:14.260
Yeah, that's really awesome.

41:14.260 --> 41:16.060
I mean, for research purposes only.

41:16.060 --> 41:18.500
Well, homebrew stuff I don't think is a problem, but anyways.

41:18.500 --> 41:22.660
I'll check it out for playing Seiken Densetsu 3 on the PS3, on the PSP.

41:22.660 --> 41:23.660
Thank you.

41:23.660 --> 41:24.660
Exactly.

41:24.660 --> 41:26.460
favorite uh... the

41:26.460 --> 41:31.000
scum version 3.0 or version 3's come out which can run uh... monkey island

41:31.000 --> 41:32.500
and stuff so if you have the old

41:32.500 --> 41:37.100
if you have the old monkey island game like i do i have a cd somewhere out there for it

41:37.100 --> 41:40.580
i can copy it over and play it on my psp

41:40.580 --> 41:41.680
and loom

41:41.680 --> 41:47.140
loom i love loom i was playing this one though called uh... i don't remember it's called

41:47.140 --> 41:48.900
the initials of B.A.S.S anyways

41:48.900 --> 41:51.540
uh... it is an ok game but it ran really well

41:51.540 --> 41:54.720
I was surprised, for emulating a PC game, runs great.

41:54.720 --> 41:57.000
You know, I found my copy of Loom.

41:57.000 --> 41:58.980
I was gonna install it and play it.

41:58.980 --> 42:01.300
Was Maniac Mansion on that same software?

42:01.300 --> 42:02.740
Uh...

42:02.740 --> 42:04.180
The Day of the Tentacle was.

42:04.180 --> 42:05.700
Ah, that's why I'm getting confused.

42:05.700 --> 42:08.940
But Maniac Mansion, you played on the NES emulator.

42:08.940 --> 42:10.820
And finally, the last thing I'd say is

42:10.820 --> 42:11.980
PSPPaint

42:11.980 --> 42:16.380
version 3 is out, so I made a cool little picture, and it's not really good.

42:16.380 --> 42:17.720
But you can save your pictures now.

42:17.720 --> 42:22.520
Yes, I saw your lovely interpretation of Grand Theft Auto that you had painted in there.

42:22.520 --> 42:24.560
GTA made me kill.

42:24.560 --> 42:29.280
Alright, one more story for you guys tonight and it has to do with the resurrection of

42:29.280 --> 42:30.280
Acclaim.

42:30.280 --> 42:34.920
Yes, somebody is going to be zombifying Acclaim by injecting it full of Worchester sauce.

42:34.920 --> 42:40.680
No, actually what's going to be happening is that Central Investment Holdings is trying

42:40.680 --> 42:47.600
to sell the rights to the Acclaim Entertainment name for $100,000.

42:47.600 --> 42:48.680
Actually no, I take that back.

42:48.680 --> 42:53.020
It's actually a trustee for the late company is making the agreement with Central Investment

42:53.020 --> 42:56.720
Holdings to sell the rights for the acclaimed name for $100,000.

42:56.720 --> 43:03.080
Also tentative deals being reached to sell the Dave Mirra freestyle BMX series and ATV

43:03.080 --> 43:06.480
quad power racing 2 over to Crave Entertainment.

43:06.480 --> 43:11.000
The value of these series, $120,000.

43:11.000 --> 43:15.960
The BMX one is not that important anymore since BMX was added to Tony Hawk's Underground

43:15.960 --> 43:18.780
I think and American wasteland has BMX in it

43:20.180 --> 43:26.900
Something to think about all right anyway, that's gonna do it for another podcast. Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts Loki oh

43:28.900 --> 43:32.920
You know podcasting is so much fun dark Sakura oh

43:35.800 --> 43:41.940
Yeah reject false icons my final thought is you are the ones who are the ball nickers

43:41.940 --> 43:47.220
And that was the little poster that made a cameo appearance in the news article.

43:47.220 --> 43:48.220
Alright, that's good.

43:48.220 --> 43:53.020
What was blurred out like the genitalia on a sim?

43:53.020 --> 43:56.820
Goodnight everybody, we'll see you next time on the Orange Lounge Radio To Go edition.

43:56.820 --> 44:01.460
That's the end of another Orange Lounge Radio To Go edition.
