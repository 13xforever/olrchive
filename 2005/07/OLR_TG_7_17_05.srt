11
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,880
Sakura. Yeah, that's a good description. Has the fan mail perked you up at all? You

12
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:07,480
get more fan mail than any of us. You know what? Wait, did you see that? She just

13
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:12,720
perked up like all of a sudden she's full of life. She's like, yay! Fan mail. Well, I

14
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:19,380
have this sort of complex about myself where I'm like, eh, that's nice but I

15
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,260
I don't deserve it, you know?

16
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:22,180
You do, though.

17
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:23,940
You're a good guy.

18
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:26,380
I can't be the diva all the time.

19
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:28,340
I have to be modest on occasion.

20
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:29,780
Maybe I want to be the diva, dammit.

21
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:30,620
Somebody send me a family.

22
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:31,620
You can't be the diva.

23
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:34,060
Oh, girl.

24
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,420
There could be only one.

25
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:36,740
There could be only one diva.

26
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:38,860
I'm going to be the diva just tonight.

27
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:40,740
I'm kind of, ugh.

28
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:41,560
All right.

29
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,020
How's the new Harry Potter book going for you?

30
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,180
I'm about halfway through it right now.

31
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:46,860
Dang, dang, you people read that book very fast.

32
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:48,260
I haven't had a whole bunch of time to read it.

33
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:51,140
This is only actually the equivalent of four hours reading.

34
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,140
Wow.

35
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,340
So which Harry Potter book does he go through puberty?

36
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:57,780
He's already been going through puberty.

37
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:00,640
He is in very much angsty teenager mode the whole time.

38
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,780
He's angry at everybody with hormones.

39
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:08,200
With the slowest they've been making the movies, pretty soon it's going to end up like Beverly

40
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:11,700
Hills 90210 where by the time the sixth or seventh movie rolls around and Harry Potter

41
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,160
is supposed to be in high school, that kid's going to be like 30.

42
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:20,580
they've actually been aging physically in good accordance because they were

43
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:24,060
going through the whole voice change thing in the third one it was cute all

44
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,260
right let me try to relate this to games a little bit have you ever played the

45
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:30,020
Harry Potter games yes I have what do you think of them crap all of them the

46
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:34,500
only one I played which one did you like it one second one I played the kiddich

47
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,860
game thought it would it's whatever kiddich quidditch I thought it was kind

48
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:42,100
of crap but I played one where Harry was just kind of walking around I think it

49
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:46,900
was Azkaban I don't remember but it was kind of cool it's okay I kind of like

50
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:51,900
exploring the all the places and doing the stuff I just wish it would be cool

51
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:56,180
it'd be like an MMORPG for the Harry Potter you know it'll happen you know

52
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:01,200
it'll I will be on that so fast we're gonna talk about another MMO potential

53
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:07,700
for lots of fanboys and girls tonight on the show all right well what you're

54
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:11,780
think in the Oregon Trail thing. Oregon Trail, the MMORPG.

55
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:16,860
It's a reference to our three-hour show earlier this evening. Which you should all be listening to as well.

56
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:20,220
One of our callers brought up Oregon Trail, the MMO, should be a great idea.

57
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,900
We're going to start an online petition and everything, so we'll see.

58
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:27,420

69
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,500
more specifically the games we've been playing this week. And who am I?

70
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,660
Oh that's right, I'm here. Yeah, we did not

71
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:09,360
Do Loki's intro? Yes, I did it. I said Loki and Dark Sakura. I'm not really away. Don't make me roll back the day

72
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,140
Are you drunk again? I'm not drunk. You act you actually got a fan mail this week cuz you know, you were drunk

73
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:16,860
I don't get fan mail. I get spam mail

74
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,380
All right. Anyway, anyways

75
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:21,580
What games you've been playing this week Dark Sakura?

76
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:25,340
Hardly any I played PSO once. Mm-hmm and

77
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:28,220
and that's really about it.

78
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:33,180
Oh no, I put Guitar Man today on my 50-inch widescreen HDTV.

79
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:38,420
It was like my entire range of vision was Guitar Man, and I suck at that game.

80
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:41,940
The power power level kicked my ass,

81
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,780
and it's only the second level.

82
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:48,420
Guitar Man is a very strange music game. It's very different. The analog, like,

83
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:52,300
in Guitar Man, of course, you're trying to play the guitar, and there's this one point where you move the analog stick

84
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,820
very carefully, and you try to trace the pattern.

85
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:58,900
it's kinda it's harder than you think yeah at least I for me but maybe I just

86
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:02,620
I think it's my first time actually playing the game and I've owned it for

87
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:03,540
two years

88
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:07,940
mmm wow I unwrapped it last year

89
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,940
alright Loki what kind of games you been playing this week? I've been working on

90
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:11,780
Killer7

91
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:16,060
made through the second level finally on third level and it just keeps getting stranger

92
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:21,020
and yeah it's pretty much that and then on PSP I've been playing a lot of

93
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,780
inboard games I've got the

94
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:26,220
Namco battle collection I've been testing out, which has been pretty cool.

95
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:30,380
Definitely got all your retro favorites in there, plus the remade ones are

96
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,000
really nice.

97
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,140
Like the remade ones from the early nineties, because like Pac-Man and

98
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:36,500
Rally-X and stuff, they had in the arcades, they were cool.

99
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:41,260
No, these weren't in the arcades, these were made specifically for the PSP.

100
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:44,700
They're really nice, they look pretty, and they play well, so that's good.

101
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:48,200
I like retro upgrades. I always liked Mario loss levels.

102
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:52,380
Well, I'm sorry, not just Mario loss levels, but that was a part of

103
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:55,260
Mario All-Stars. Thank you.

104
00:05:55,260 --> 00:06:00,260
And then I've been playing this puzzle game, uh, Col-On, um, a lot, and it's just some weird...

105
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:03,460
It's friggin' hard, it's just... but it's a lot of fun, and I've been...

106
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,820
Please tell me it's not spelled just like colon.

107
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:06,740
It's with a K.

108
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:07,580
Oh, okay, good.

109
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:09,540
K-O-L-L-O-N, okay.

110
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:14,300
I've been playing Col-On, and it was pretty cool, and I've been trying that out and stuff.

111
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,740
Wait, wait, so a puzzle game you like on PSP?

112
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,340
Yeah, it's really a lot of puzzle games coming out.

113
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:21,940
We got bashed on Mercury and Smart Bomb, so...

114
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:29,180
Well, Mercury sucked and Smart Bomb was not even finished, you know, whatever, I mean,

115
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,180
they just sucked.

116
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:33,580
But anyways, I've been trying those and then playing a little bit of Coded Arms and stuff

117
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:34,900
and it was pretty fun.

118
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:39,800
So yeah, just trying out the PSP games and stuff, whatever I can get my hands on.

119
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,500
Well go figure, while Loki's been playing PSP, I've been playing DS.

120
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,880
I played two new DS games this week.

121
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,340
First one I checked out was Puyo Puyo, the new DS version of Puyo Puyo, which it kind

122
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:52,820
of did for those you guys have played Puyo Puyo before you might have played it

123
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:58,740
and not even known it because it was called Sonic's or no Dr. Robotnik's Magic

124
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:04,300
Bean Machine on Genesis and then on Super Nintendo it was Kirby's Avalanche

125
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:07,620
whoo I remember Kirby's Avalanche it was both of them were just different

126
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:11,140
versions of Puyo Puyo well they have this game now and it's original kind of

127
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:15,740
Japanese anime form on the DS but they kind of changed the game a little bit

128
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:19,940
They change some of the mechanics, like they put fat pieces in them, like pieces that would

129
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:25,640
usually be like, think of super gems from Puzzle Fighter 2 that fall, like big red,

130
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:30,220
they're like 2x2s, they're just like fat red pieces and stuff, you know, different colors.

131
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:34,540
So they change some of the game mechanics and keep it a little bit fresh.

132
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:38,580
Some of the rest of the game though is a little bit dorky, like they have the cut scenes where

133
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:41,420
they're talking to each other and it's all anime style, so they're all like cute little

134
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:46,820
girls talking like this except they talk very slow when they do their talking so

135
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:50,540
you know you're like sitting waiting waiting and it's kind of like why is it

136
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:53,340
in a lot of these games when they're talking to each other back and forth

137
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:58,780
they don't talk normally they slow down their speech like they're reading it

138
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:06,420
line by line why is that so I don't know but it's it I was kind of impressed just

139
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:09,660
to see all that in a little teeny DS cartridge the fact that they even had

140
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:14,620
voice acting in it so I guess it's a you know hope of what's to come type thing

141
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:18,700
but you know Puyo Puyo it isn't about the cutscenes it's about the action of

142
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:21,980
the game so for a puzzle game it's a lot of fun if you liked any of those games I

143
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:25,140
previously mentioned like Kirby's Avalanche and stuff you will like this

144
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:30,540
game also loving this the new DS games are starting to be eight player games

145
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:34,700
off of one cartridge Bomberman, Meteos not necessarily eight players but four

146
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:39,460
you know loving that so I'm very happy to report that Puyo Puyo does the

147
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:44,340
multi-player off one cartridge as well, that's great. Also, another DS game I

148
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:47,500
checked out this week was Kirby's Canvas Curse, which has actually been out for

149
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,700
about a month now, but I got it for my birthday. Thank you, Loki. So I've actually

150
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:54,540
been playing that, and I have to admit I didn't want to play this game at first

151
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:58,060
because I had a bad feeling it was gonna be like Yoshi Touch and Go, which if you

152
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:00,980
listen to earlier podcasts, I did not like Yoshi Touch and Go. I thought it was

153
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:05,300
way too generic, like it felt unfinished, like it was like there was only two

154
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:08,460
stages in the game or something. I didn't care for Yoshi Touch and Go, but I'm

155
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:14,220
I'm proud to report, Kirby's Canvas Curse takes a lot of those kind of concepts in Yoshi

156
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,640
Touch and Go, even though the games were probably being developed around the same time, a lot

157
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,460
of those concepts in Yoshi's Touch and Go are brought into Kirby's Canvas Curse and

158
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,380
it's done much better.

159
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:27,500
So if you actually liked Yoshi's Touch and Go, I didn't, but if you did, you will like

160
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:32,760
Kirby's Canvas Curse because there's way more interactivity and there's so many different

161
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,780
levels and things to unlock.

162
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:37,780
And if you're a Kirby fan, you're going to like it because it has the old music and the

163
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:42,020
cute graphics. But please note, this does not play like a normal Kirby game. That's

164
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:46,220
one thing you want to keep in mind. It's Kirby Canvas Curse, and basically Kirby sort of

165
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:50,660
moves automatically, and you can touch him with a stylus to make him roll faster, or

166
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:55,000
if he's killed an enemy, you can use the power. Like if you hit one of the stone guys, then

167
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,740
tapping on Kirby will make him turn into a stone. But it doesn't function like the other

168
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:03,060
ones. You don't suck in the enemies using your breath like you did in the old Kirby

169
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:07,760
games, it doesn't quite have that same gameplay element. The gameplay is much

170
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,480
different because you're drawing paths for Kirby to take, which I know sounds

171
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:15,520
very simple, but it's actually kind of complicated and the level design is

172
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:19,620
pretty smart in the game. So I guess that's kind of my review. If you like

173
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:23,640
Kirby the character, you'll like this game. If you like Kirby the actual game,

174
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:28,640
you may want to rent or borrow this one first to make sure that the mechanics of

175
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,600
the game are gonna be something you enjoy. But if you liked Touch and Go,

176
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,300
you're gonna like this one. So that's my thought on Kirby Campus Curse. I forgot to mention

177
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:39,620
I also played one more game called- What's that? Glow Race Fantastic Carnival? It's some

178
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:46,220
racing game that's in Korea for the PSP. I don't like it. It was lame. I'm sorry to hear

179
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:50,300
that. It's like a cheap version of Mario Kart that's not even close to being Mario Kart

180
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:54,580
and just lame. I can't wait for Mario Kart DS though. Oh yeah. You know Mario Kart DS

181
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:57,700
and Animal Crossing DS are gonna have the online thing. At least that's what they're

182
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:01,220
saying right now. Yeah I hope so. I can't wait for that. Well you know it's gonna happen.

183
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:06,140
showing it off at E3. But what's interesting is that OneUp.com ran a story this week about

184
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:12,260
Metroid Prime Hunters not having the online capability and just kind of, why didn't, you

185
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:15,460
know, because this game's been delayed and delayed over and over again, why didn't they

186
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:19,740
bother to add in the online capability? Because think about it, Metroid Prime Hunters have

187
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:24,540
been a lot of fun online. And there's some quotes in the articles here. The producer

188
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:28,860
of the game, Kensuke Tanabe, says, really, we could have made this game online, but Nintendo's

189
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:32,900
version of online play is different from that of other companies we wanted it to

190
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:36,780
be free easy and easy to access for everybody to set up the kind of

191
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:39,980
infrastructure that we needed and to meet the launch date we have for this

192
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:45,180
game the two just didn't match and that makes me think what was the launch date

193
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:49,020
for this game because dang it's been like a year since the DS came out well

194
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:52,380
okay maybe not quite that life feels like a year in reality it's probably

195
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:57,080
been what eight months or so since DS came out and prime hunters was the

196
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:00,560
built-in demo and I would think that the built-in demo would be the game that

197
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,880
would be coming out within like the first three months so unless there was

198
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:08,440
just one hell of a teaser that's what it basically ended up being and of course

199
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:12,640
then they kind of you know try to soften the blow here about Metroid Prime

200
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:16,800
Hunters not being online Richard Verotti game designer over at Nintendo says I

201
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,480
don't think we look at it as a negative thing because we're not focusing on the

202
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,120
internet we got to focus on the Wi-Fi stuff so four players can jump in like

203
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,700
that and if only one person has the game well you can download it too and then

204
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,580
play with your friends I think it's gonna be the perfect multiplayer game

205
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:34,820
because of that and I'll give them points for that I do like the fact on

206
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:38,420
the DS you really get to sample a lot of games because it seems to be this

207
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:41,520
running trend in a lot of games where you can play off of one cartridge and

208
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:45,720
that at least is cool but the internet thing would have been cool I would have

209
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,740
liked to play some of our podcast listeners on the internet but yeah I

210
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:54,420
I lost my Metroid Prime Hunters demo. So I don't know where it is. I know exactly where mine is. It's

211
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:59,100
The demo is fun, but I want the full game, you know, and what's weird? I didn't really like it

212
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:04,500
I you know what? I don't like the 3d metroids on GameCube personally, like I did not get into them

213
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:08,040
I love old-school Metroid Super Metroid. I think is one of the greatest games ever made

214
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:11,460
I'm still gonna have to send you the Metroid maker. Oh like make your own

215
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:17,440
Oh, you gotta send this someone had done a map editor for Metroid and someone has actually made a Metroid game out of a ROM hack

216
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:22,520
thing so yeah that's cool um I love super I did not get into the three to

217
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:27,320
eight three two three three D metroids as much but I love the the DS one I

218
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:31,160
actually for some reason that the 3d thing works for me on that I don't know

219
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:34,360
why it doesn't look nearly as good as it does on GameCube but for some reason I

220
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:39,800
like it I don't I don't know what it is go figure all right so what do you guys

221
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:44,480
think online play on DS something that more games should be looking at doing or

222
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:49,780
let's let's see how these early ones do first before we start going let's get

223
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:54,500
more online play because if it's gonna suck then no all right we got a couple

224
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:59,600
letters tonight sent to us via to go at orange lounge radio.com that's to go at

225
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,980
orange lounge radio.com so I thought we'd read a couple letters unfortunately

226
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:06,020
we get we're getting a lot of mail so we don't have time to answer everything but

227
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:10,460
dark Sakura she does check that mailbox and yeah I'd reply to my mailbox bill

228
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,460
All I'm getting is spam!

229
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:15,460
Do you need breast enhancement?

230
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:19,460
Apparently I do, because there's a lot of people sending me that info.

231
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:22,460
I still like that one webcomic you linked me to, Rob.

232
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:24,460
The Spamusement. That's hilarious.

233
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:29,460
I love Spamusement. Seriously, I think it's the best webcomic out there.

234
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:33,460
And it's so simple. Spamusement.com gets my full endorsement. I love that site.

235
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:35,460
Alright, let's open up the mailbag.

236
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:45,500
Let's see, we got a fan letter here. I'm going to read the Loki fan letter here. This was

237
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:50,660
from Same. Same says he was catching up on some of the old podcasts while cleaning up

238
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:54,820
around my room and I was listening to the July 4th podcast and I must say the following

239
00:14:54,820 --> 00:15:00,220
words. I loved it. I am so serious. Loki was hilarious and I couldn't stop laughing every

240
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:07,220
time he spoke. Do it some more. Seriously guys, that game was awful. Seriously. It was

241
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:15,620
really awful. Seriously, it was awful. Look, um, Loki, next time he drinks, he's gonna

242
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:20,180
be under strict monitoring when he drinks. He barfed on the carpet! It was disgusting!

243
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:25,380
I had 20 shots of vodka! I mean, what do you expect? You need to be babysat next time you

244
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:29,840
I thought it was a single shot glue drink responsibly boys and girls

245
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,440
I didn't even think about it

246
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:36,000
Alright, let's get to another letter here. This one is from

247
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:41,140
Does this person have a handle? I couldn't see it in here. Sorry if you had a handle and I missed it

248
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:46,440
This is from Brett and Brett wants to know I played Silent Hill 1 & 2

249
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,680
I thought the second game was one of the best games available at the time

250
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:54,200
I absolutely love Silent Hill 2 and then Silent Hill 3 popped its ugly head

251
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:59,600
I wasn't feeling the 17 year old life vesting wearing chick and the game was a bit boring to me

252
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,440
I think I played about two hours of it. My question is Silent Hill 4. Is it worth checking out?

253
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,600
I know that the movie is coming out soon. It's been a hot topic on the show

254
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:11,680
So Silent Hill 4 is the only one of the series. I haven't played yet. Should I give it a whirl?

255
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,080
That's from Brett. What do you guys think those you guys definitely?

256
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:19,720
Definitely you think so it's pretty good. What do you think dark Sakura? Have you played?

257
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:23,560
We've had my copy of Silent Hill 4. I hope you've played it. Well, I have my own copy

258
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,280
I thought I gave you yours back.

259
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,280
I don't know.

260
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,280
Well, I'll find it sometime when I unpack.

261
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,280
Alright, that's cool.

262
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,280
What do you think, though?

263
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,280
Would you recommend Silent Hill 4?

264
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,280
Well, yeah.

265
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,280
You know, Silent...

266
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:39,480
First of all, in my response that I had given back, I would say I told him to try Silent

267
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:44,680
Hill 3 all the way through, because it really does get a lot better, but Silent Hill 4 is

268
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:50,520
definitely from a male perspective, and it's very, I think, unique to the series.

269
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,920
Very cool.

270
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:57,000
I would definitely recommend Silent Hill 4. I, to be honest, I haven't even really

271
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,760
played Silent Hill 3.

272
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:02,120
So, but... I'm liking it. I really like Silent Hill 3.

273
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:05,920
Silent Hill 4 is a continuation of the story from Silent Hill 2.

274
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:09,040
So, I don't see how it could really be amiss.

275
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:12,240
I love the soundtrack, especially. The soundtrack, I think, is one of the best

276
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:12,960
parts

277
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:16,400
of the whole game. That's what I love about it. So,

278
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,560
at least rent it. Do yourself a favor, rent it. I think the idea of renting

279
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,920
games is really great so definitely check that out.

280
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:30,320
Alright and then one other letter we got from Mark and Mark actually lives in the UK and

281
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:35,200
sent us a really great email, so great, but it was kind of long so I can't read the whole

282
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,160
thing but it's a follow up to last week's podcast, remember how we were talking about

283
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:44,280
the rating system and I said that they should do it like they do the movies.

284
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:49,600
Well in here Mark writes, well this is how it's done in the UK to an extent, game ratings

285
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:56,260
Ratings in most of Europe are given out by the Pan-European Gaming Information with ratings

286
00:17:56,260 --> 00:18:01,820
including 3+, 7+, 12, 16, and 18 printed on the boxes for each game, and often also accompanied

287
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:05,980
by icons to describe the reasons for this rating.

288
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:10,100
Although I don't believe the ratings are legally binding, retailers do tend to enforce the

289
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,980
16 and 18 ratings.

290
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:15,980
Also, most retailers will not stock a game without a PEGI rating, although again I don't

291
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:21,140
think there's a legal requirement for them to do so.

292
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:25,780
And then went on to say, the ratings tend to be quite effective as the 15 and 18 ratings

293
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:30,760
have been used on movies for a very long time, so parents recognize the logos and understand

294
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,940
the reasons for these ratings.

295
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:37,680
Although Vinny linked us to an article that said that maybe the studies don't quite link

296
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,680
up to that.

297
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:42,620
And then they were talking about, Mark was talking about the hysteria, regarding hysteria

298
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:47,900
about violent games in the UK. A notable recent case involved a boy, 14, getting murdered

299
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:53,840
by an older teenager. It was reported that the older teenager had been inspired to kill

300
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:59,440
the younger child by the game Manhunt. So that was kind of a whole big thing going on

301
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:05,160
over there. Very interesting to hear the UK perspective. And then Mark ends his letter

302
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:10,040
by saying, maybe everyone would be more mellow if Katamari Damacy ever came out over here.

303
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,000
And I didn't even realize that game wasn't out over there.

304
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,560
Neither did I. You need that game. You guys need that game. Import that stuff or something.

305
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:19,040
Well, I don't think they can because of the television difference, but...

306
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:23,600
Hey, you know what? A lot of TVs come out now able to switch between PAL and NTSC.

307
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,560
Figure out a way to do it. You guys need that game. You're right. People would mellow out if

308
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,800
they could play some Katamari Damacy. Play it on a computer monitor.

309
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,520
Very cool. No problem on a computer monitor. All right. Thank you very much, Mark, for your

310
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:38,720
mail. It was very nice. I like it in the long mails. It really shows they listen to us. It's

311
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,600
great alright so we're gonna close up the mailbag again if you guys have an

312
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:48,200
email to go at orange launch radio dot-com are the PlayStation 2 version of

313
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:52,760
Grand Theft Auto San Andreas it was confirmed by GameSpot that it does have

314
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:56,760
the hot coffee content so that's interesting because as we were saying

315
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:02,160
last week you have to mod your game to do this but apparently the sequence of

316
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,540
codes have been discovered or something that will actually unlock this in the

317
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:10,460
PlayStation 2 version of the game which kind of goes well well now is this a

318
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:14,860
case of Rockstar was just lazy and didn't take the code out apparently it

319
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:19,940
could be like you know the code pointing to it or whatever could be like you know

320
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:25,180
truncated out or something like that I just put one code in there to patch you

321
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:29,700
know the rewrite the code I mean I don't see how they're guilty for having this

322
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:32,820
code in there if it's disabled I mean there's a lot of things that can be

323
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:36,820
disabled in a game but that's not part of the game it's not what you're playing

324
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:39,380
because now this issue is just snowballing it's training bigger there

325
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:42,740
were reports earlier this week that now Hillary Clinton is on board against all

326
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:47,860
this oh come on she needs him something you know the bitch about but I I think

327
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:52,180
you know I I'm not gonna dog Hillary Clinton or whatever because I think well

328
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:56,420
I will blame because I think a lot of people in this case are being a little

329
00:20:56,420 --> 00:21:00,500
bit ignorant and I can't say I blame them 100% because not everybody's a

330
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,200
gamer and I don't think there's any senators that are video gamers although

331
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,780
if there are that would be cool and I would vote for them. She probably thinks

332
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:09,900
that you know Bill Clinton slept with Monica. Now wait a minute. Because

333
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:14,560
he saw the whores in you know Grand Theft Auto. Wait a minute. There's nothing

334
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:21,700
to do with it. Does it? I think people are thinking that this is actually in the

335
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:27,240
game and was like something hidden by the people who coded it as some type of

336
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:31,420
of, like, secret feature, but that really doesn't seem to be the case when you look

337
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:32,420
into it.

338
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:33,420
Oh, but do they do the research?

339
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,420
No!

340
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,420
Well, that's the problem.

341
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,340
I think that's why this whole thing is blown out of proportion.

342
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:40,940
I don't think people have been doing the appropriate research, and I'm hoping that that is the

343
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:44,260
investigation they're going to do, and that's what they're going to find out, because what

344
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:50,980
they want to find out, did Rockstar release this game knowing that they were marketing

345
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:55,920
this as a mature game when it should have been adults only because this would be unlocked

346
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,920
by somebody?

347
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:01,840
some hacker went and figured out a way to do it and Rockstar was under the

348
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,560
impression that that wouldn't happen because they had removed the code that

349
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:12,000
points to the hot coffee mug. And did they, I don't know, investigate why

350
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,040
Janet Jackson's boob popped out? No, they did not. Instead, they pointed fingers.

351
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:19,240
That's the whole reason. They're not going to investigate it because

352
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:23,200
why? Because they have this bias against the game industry anyways and this is

353
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,420
just more fuel to their fire that's it you know they're just they they want to

354
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:32,300
see everything censored and everything you know hunky-dory Christian so what I

355
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:36,140
don't understand this is something you know if you think about it M would be

356
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:39,820
like an R rating on a movie right because a o would be like the NC 17

357
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:43,420
rating right and they want to say that this hot coffee mod should earn this

358
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:47,660
game and adults only rating but my god have you seen sex scenes and how many are

359
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:51,020
rated movies I mean should that really qualify this game for an a o rating

360
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:55,460
granted I'm maybe I myself being a leader here because I have not seen the

361
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:59,420
mod myself but I'm assuming how bad can it be it's pixelated for God's sake how

362
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,420
bad can it be

363
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:05,340
you know I don't well it is pretty graphic but it's not

364
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:09,700
the grant to graphic to the point where I'd say it be either money shots

365
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:12,940
no that there just pixelated movies

366
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:16,100
but still still look at look at God war

367
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:19,540
there's a sex minigame in that game and I mean

368
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:24,980
And there's boobies that are not pixelated, they're out there saying hello, and he basically

369
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:28,860
says, you know, hey, thanks for the screw, get off my fucking boat, you know, that's

370
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:29,860
basically...

371
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:31,900
And that game was an M-rated game, right?

372
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:32,900
Yes it was.

373
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:33,900
An M-rated game.

374
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:34,900
Not AO.

375
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:35,900
Not AO.

376
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:36,900
Interesting.

377
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:41,380
It's because there's like, penetration in it or something, you know.

378
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:43,060
Who knows?

379
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:46,180
Anybody that's learned about the birds and the bees knows that when we're talking about

380
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:48,460
sex, penetration's involved.

381
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:52,980
on there's a freaking dildo weapon in this game I mean do we do you can

382
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:57,940
actually put in a code to get an army of whores with dildos and vibrators running

383
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:02,480
behind you while you're in a gimp costume I mean come on this game is you

384
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,900
know it's meant to be this way people are reading way too much in this is you

385
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:09,220
know what's gonna happen people are gonna see that hot coffee mutt they're

386
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:13,020
gonna go rape people that's what's gonna happen because you know Grand Theft Auto

387
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:16,740
causes people to murder each other because you know it's just subliminal

388
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:21,100
messaging because we we have no control if if we see TV do it we've got to go do

389
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:24,760
it it's an impulse well bottom line and I think we can all agree on this kids

390
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:28,380
shouldn't be playing Grand Theft Auto why are you buying your kids Grand Theft

391
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:32,260
Auto honestly I walked in the game spot just last week and I watched a parent

392
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:35,580
let her kid who couldn't have been older than 12 by Grand Theft Auto and I'm just

393
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:42,140
thinking okay I realize that there's very mature 14 15 16 year olds out there

394
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:45,220
that can probably handle it I know 14 year olds that are more mature than some

395
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:48,980
32 year old I know I think contract because when you're buying this for the

396
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:52,660
fucking people make them sign a contract if it's their parents buying for him say

397
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:58,100
I understand what is in this game and I understand it oh and then that way if

398
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:01,060
their son goes and murder somebody and they blame it on grant the thought but

399
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:05,140
no no no no no because you understood what you were getting into so that's

400
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:13,180
your own damn fault bad parent bad all right I'm sure we'll get some emails on

401
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:17,260
that one let's go to a happy family-friendly story shall we will talk

402
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:21,480
about worms a nice game about worms oh wait these worms have guns and blow each

403
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:24,600
other up I guess this isn't so family-friendly I like worms but worms is

404
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:28,720
coming to the PSP and DS I liked worms when it was called scorched earth and it

405
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:33,480
was out on the PC like 10 years 15 years ago by the way it's up scorched earth is

406
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:37,940
actually being ported to the PSP already has that's awesome

407
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:42,620
thq today announced that it'll publish two new worms games for the DS and the

408
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:47,900
PSP. No release date set yet, but is it really any surprise that Worms is coming

409
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,800
out on the DS and the PSP? Probably not.

410
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:54,920
I don't know, but THQ, I want my five dollars back because the cell phone game version of

411
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:59,060
Worms sucked ass.

412
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:03,480
I thought this was interesting. Sega, it is rumored that their new arcade board

413
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,680
is actually based on the Xbox 360. I heard that.

414
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:10,220
The distributors in Japan are saying that the Lindbergh system, which is Sega's new

415
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:15,680
system their new arcade board it does use the 360 architecture very interesting

416
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:20,120
and this by the way would be the second time that a Microsoft console has been

417
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:25,220
the inspiration for a Sega arcade cabinet the Chihiro board was based on

418
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:29,200
the current Xbox you mean it's not the third time that that's happened since

419
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:33,560
there's only been I don't know two systems so this logically can only be

420
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:38,400
the second time just just reporting just reporting what's on the internet out

421
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,600
there okay dark soccer you're Sega fangirl what do you think of this one

422
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,940
Sega teaming up with well not necessarily teaming up with Microsoft

423
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:50,580
but certainly using a lot of their stuff as long as they're using them and not

424
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:54,740
climbing into bed with them I'm happy you know it makes sense though because look

425
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:59,240
at them like for instance I saw an article on project Gotham Racing 3 near

426
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:03,880
photorealistic imagery that's in that game I mean it's just amazing just the

427
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:07,160
quality graphics that can be pushed out by the sport more power to them if they

428
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,740
want to make an arcade game like that wait a minute did I just hear you say

429
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:15,680
something nice about the Xbox yes about the Xbox 360 can somebody please note

430
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:20,860
the date and time this is a miracle the 360 I still dislike the fact that it's

431
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:23,900
you know that one of the selling points is custom faceplates because that's

432
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:29,540
retarded but you know whatever hey it's that it's aimed at that same market that

433
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:33,900
watches pimp my ride what can I say speaking of the s box 360 I have one

434
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:39,020
more quick story on this. Marvel said this week, and this is of course at the Comic-Con

435
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:45,020
convention they unveiled this, they have an exclusive agreement with Microsoft to produce

436
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:51,100
MMORPGs that will be on the Xbox 360. So you can expect to see like Spider-Man and all

437
00:27:51,100 --> 00:28:00,100
that stuff, MMORPGs, Fantastic Four also, X-Men, Iron Man, only on Xbox 360 and MMORPG4.

438
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:03,280
Yeah, it's going to be a Marvel Universe MMO.

439
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:08,280
This is no surprise because they actually filed lawsuits against people that did, what

440
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,280
was it?

441
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:14,160
The Superhero City of Heroes because of their character generator people were using to create

442
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:19,720
likenesses of characters that look very similar to this and they said that that would cause,

443
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:24,620
that would kind of put a dent in the being able to create an MMO featuring Marvel characters.

444
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:29,240
So we knew this was coming, but yeah, I mean DC is doing theirs, so why not?

445
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:35,120
Sony Online is working with DC, that was announced earlier, so that's just kind of interesting.

446
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,100
You know, that's kind of what I thought when I first heard this, I was like, don't we already

447
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:42,760
have a game called City of Heroes?

448
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:46,840
But in City of Heroes, it's more about creating your own thing, and with the Marvel games,

449
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:50,680
it's about playing characters that, well, assumably, you're going to play as characters

450
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:53,320
or interact with characters that you know and love.

451
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:57,640
You know, a lot of people love Fantastic Four, Spider-Man, just absolute fandoms out there

452
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,200
for this, so this game is going to appease them.

453
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:03,560
Are they going to kill off all the main characters like they did for the Matrix game?

454
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,560
What?

455
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,560
Oh, nothing.

456
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,560
I'm sorry.

457
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,560
Alright.

458
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,560
Um.

459
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:12,720
By the way, follow up to your lawsuit there, NCSoft had a little bit of a victory there

460
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,120
because the judge threw out a lot of Marvel's complaints, just so you know.

461
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,120
Eh.

462
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,120
Alright.

463
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,120
Alright, moving on.

464
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,560
Loki, why don't you tell us what's going on in the hack and crack world?

465
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,560
Lots of stuff.

466
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:31,200
First off, PSP stuff, they have released the brand new loader for the PSP UMD rips.

467
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,080
It's 2.5e or something like that.

468
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:41,560
It allows most of the games to play with Wi-Fi and sound because I guess the PRX files, they're

469
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:45,740
like these library files kind of like on Windows where you have DLL files.

470
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:49,580
Library files are being loaded now so you can do Wi-Fi in a lot of games and you can

471
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:52,940
also overclock the games as well, which was kind of neat.

472
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:53,940
So that was one of the things.

473
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:59,040
The other thing that came out which was really cool was the SCUMM VM PSP Beta.

474
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:07,660
And for those who don't know, SCUMM stands for, what was it, it was, oh man, it's the

475
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:14,060
programming language that they use to write games like Maniac Mansion and Monkey Island

476
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:16,060
and those wonderful games, the LucasArts games.

477
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:21,400
Anyway, so you can actually play these games now, you can put this file on there and play

478
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:24,760
all your PC games. Those LucasArts games were awesome, like Loom and stuff. Yes, they are

479
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:31,240
awesome, yes. So you can play those and that was really cool. Of course, also, the other

480
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:39,240
thing that was really, that came out, they actually have brand new emulators and stuff.

481
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:45,520
They have one for the Dreamcast VMUs, which is kind of interesting. The other thing, what

482
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:53,320
that I put on there the other week. I don't know, just updates to all the brand new emulators

483
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:58,200
and whatnot. So, you know, check out the updates, they're really cool. Just lots of cool stuff

484
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:02,840
out there. Like I said before, you know, check out PSPupdates.com, you can find a lot of

485
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:06,880
info on there. Just lots of cool games, especially since Scorched Earth is being ported over,

486
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:16,240
that's really nice. We need ZZT. We need ZZT. Please, ZZT. Oh, one more thing. Oh, I forgot.

487
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:22,920
Doom. They fixed Doom, so now it plays better and it has good sound. Sounds good. Lots of

488
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:27,320
homebrew stuff on the PSP. It's just exploding. Alright, well we here at Orange Lounge Radio,

489
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:30,960
we're not here to just talk about video games all the time, because if we played video games

490
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:36,640
all the time, we'd have no time to go to the mall. So, we're here to better your life and

491
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:41,960
In what way better to better your life than allow the one and only DarkSakura to present

492
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,840
her advice column.

493
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,480
So DarkSakura, what are you going to be giving us advice about tonight?

494
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:52,680
Today's bit of advice is how to escape when tied up.

495
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,840
Some people may not want to escape when tied up.

496
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:55,840
Hey!

497
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,280
We need to stay PG rated tonight.

498
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,280
Sorry.

499
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,480
Well, he already dropped the F bomb.

500
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,160
Yeah, well fuck what he did, okay?

501
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,160
Okay, sorry.

502
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:10,280
Number one, when your captors start binding you, expand your body as much as possible.

503
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:14,400
Take a deep breath, puff out your chest, and pull your shoulders back.

504
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:19,680
Two, flex your arms against the bonds, push against the bonds as much as possible.

505
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:24,080
Three, once your captors leave, suck in your chest and stomach, wiggle free with the extra

506
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,360
room you have given yourself.

507
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,800
But my final bit of advice...

508
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,800
Yes?

509
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:33,800
This bondage party is sick, man, sick.

510
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:38,320
Alright. And with that, DarkSakura, you're...

511
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:41,840
are you on your way out? Yes, I must.

512
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:45,000
Alright. The man has the car today. I see. Alright.

513
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,520
And I'd recommend you also don't try to get out of your bondages with a

514
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:51,960
lighter because you might set fire to the whole Nazi castle

515
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:55,600
like in, uh, Indiana Jones.

516
00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:00,800
Shut up. Alright. DarkSakura, your final thought, then, before you take off.

517
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,720
Fuck your yaky blue jeans. I'm sorry. Reject false icons.

518
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,720
Alright, bye DarkSakura!

519
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,720
Bye!

520
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,720
Have fun storming the castle!

521
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,720
Okay, we're not done just yet.

522
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:13,720
We have another couple quick stories for you guys, then we're gonna make it a wrap.

523
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,720
PlayStation 3.

524
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:19,720
You remember how PlayStation 3 was originally supposed to double as a router as well?

525
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,720
It was?

526
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,720
Yeah.

527
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,720
It was originally gonna double as a router.

528
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,720
Well kids, not anymore.

529
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,720
It's no longer going to be a router.

530
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:31,720
They have quietly dropped over at Sony the PlayStation 3 router functionality.

531
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:35,720
and that was going to, of course, make your PlayStation 3 able to function as a router.

532
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:39,720
Well, I can understand why they had it function as a router,

533
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:42,720
because I was looking at the pictures of it and there's like three ethernet ports,

534
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,720
and I'm like, what the hell is that for?

535
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,720
There's like 5,000 ports on the back of a PlayStation 3.

536
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:50,720
But ethernet ports, I'm like, what the hell do they need three ethernet ports for?

537
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,720
I just didn't understand that, but whatever.

538
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:56,720
Well, now you've got to wonder, are they even going to be the ethernet ports anymore

539
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,720
if they're getting rid of the network?

540
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:02,040
probably blank but so they're gonna remove functionality like you know will

541
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,920
it not be able to play games pretty soon because they've removed the hard drive

542
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:09,660
they remove you know this they remove what else I mean here's a hint Sony

543
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:14,760
remove the boomerang your old controller was just fine seriously don't try to

544
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:22,560
improve on something that's already good all right you know but the rumor is that

545
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:26,920
the revolution is still gonna have this router capability with it that would be

546
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:31,320
cool yeah I mean I don't I don't but but how well we'll see we'll see we

547
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:34,800
speculate all we want I thought they were releasing their own like router or

548
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,200
something no no no no we don't know until they start showing the goods

549
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:45,040
rumors rumors until then last story tonight interesting report over on BMJ

550
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,920
journals calm this is a site that's dedicated to light it's like a

551
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:54,160
healthcare archive kind of has a lot of reports it's the general medical

552
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:58,160
Journal website is what they call it on their main page. They had an article

553
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:01,400
recently about video games and health so if you want to look at this up

554
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:05,960
bmjjournals.com talking about how video games can be used in the treating of

555
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:10,400
cancer patients which kind of makes you go well that's kind of weird you know

556
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,920
you wouldn't think of that but sure enough they say in the report here one

557
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,000
innovative application of video games in healthcare is their use in pain

558
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,200
management. The degree of attention needed to play such a game can distract

559
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:25,760
the player from the sensation of pain, a strategy that has been reported and evaluated amongst

560
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:30,380
pediatric patients. One case study reported the use of a handheld video game to stop an

561
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:34,140
eight-year-old boy from picking at his face. Because, you know, he had this disease that

562
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:39,460
was causing him to want to, you know, pick at his face and stuff. So, just kind of interesting,

563
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:43,240
video games taking your mind off of other things being used as actual medical treatment.

564
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:47,620
So what a nice follow-up to have to the, you know, video games are evil story that we had

565
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:52,180
earlier in the show. It sure beats the, you know, dog cone caller for it, like, you know,

566
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:58,620
people are trying to pick their face. But I guess that's right. But, uh, yeah, I guess

567
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:05,300
that's good. I mean, you know. Laura Croft fights cancer. Alright. Maybe that'll be the

568
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:10,540
next Tomb Raider. Alright, kids, that's gonna do it. That's gonna do it for just don't even

569
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:13,920
talk because you're gonna offend somebody. I know you're thinking and you're just gonna

570
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,000
to offend somebody.

571
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,100
All right, you know what?

572
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:22,540
Just email Loki if you want to know the jokes, okay? Just email him.

573
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:25,020
He'd like the attention.

574
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:28,360
That's gonna do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio To Go.

575
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:31,320
Loki, your final thought.

576
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:35,240
No, I gotta play some more games.

577
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,720
I'm trying to... I gotta

578
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:40,840
work on some Killer7 and hopefully they're gonna import ZZT over.

579
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:45,800
Otherwise the next thing I gotta do is I gotta make some hacked ROMs and put them in my Nintendo

580
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:46,800
emulator.

581
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:51,440
Alright, and my final thought is, I'm gonna go play on my new HDTV, I'm gonna go play

582
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,440
2DX widescreen.

583
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,440
Woohoo!

584
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,440
That's it!

585
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:59,240
