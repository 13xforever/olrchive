[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

6
00:00:59,178 --> 00:01:00,699
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good description.

7
00:01:00,939 --> 00:01:02,641
[SPEAKER_01]: Has the fan mail perked you up at all?

8
00:01:02,781 --> 00:01:04,262
[SPEAKER_01]: You get more fan mail than any of us.

9
00:01:04,802 --> 00:01:05,443
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

10
00:01:05,603 --> 00:01:07,304
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait, did you see that?

11
00:01:07,324 --> 00:01:08,165
[SPEAKER_01]: She just perked up.

12
00:01:08,185 --> 00:01:09,526
[SPEAKER_01]: All of a sudden, she's full of life.

13
00:01:09,546 --> 00:01:10,286
[SPEAKER_01]: She's like, yay!

14
00:01:10,967 --> 00:01:11,487
[SPEAKER_03]: Fan mail.

15
00:01:11,928 --> 00:01:16,211
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I have this sort of complex about myself where I'm like...

16
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:20,960
[SPEAKER_03]: Eh, that's nice, but I don't deserve it, you know?

17
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:22,061
[SPEAKER_01]: You do, though.

18
00:01:22,141 --> 00:01:23,901
[SPEAKER_01]: You're a good gal.

19
00:01:23,961 --> 00:01:25,442
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't be the diva all the time.

20
00:01:25,462 --> 00:01:27,863
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to be modest on occasion.

21
00:01:28,303 --> 00:01:29,723
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I want to be the diva, dammit.

22
00:01:29,743 --> 00:01:30,404
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody send me a fan letter.

23
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:31,264
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't be the diva.

24
00:01:33,291 --> 00:01:33,892
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, girl.

25
00:01:33,912 --> 00:01:35,132
[SPEAKER_01]: There could be only one.

26
00:01:35,373 --> 00:01:36,233
[SPEAKER_01]: There could be only one.

27
00:01:36,313 --> 00:01:38,775
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm going to be the diva just tonight.

28
00:01:38,815 --> 00:01:41,056
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kind of... All right.

29
00:01:41,257 --> 00:01:42,818
[SPEAKER_01]: How's the new Harry Potter book going for you?

30
00:01:42,958 --> 00:01:44,059
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm about halfway through it right now.

31
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:46,480
[SPEAKER_01]: Dang, you people read that book very fast.

32
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,161
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't had a whole bunch of time to read it.

33
00:01:48,201 --> 00:01:50,603
[SPEAKER_03]: This is only actually the equivalent of four hours reading.

34
00:01:51,203 --> 00:01:51,524
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

35
00:01:52,204 --> 00:01:54,646
[SPEAKER_02]: So which Harry Potter book does he go through puberty?

36
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:56,249
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

37
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:19,920
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

38
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:51,925
[SPEAKER_01]: Quidditch Quidditch, whatever, Quidditch, Quidditch I thought it was kind of crap But I played one where Harry was just kind of walking around I think it was Azkaban, I don't remember But it was kind of cool, it was okay I kind of like exploring all the places and doing the stuff I just wish, you know what would be cool?

39
00:02:51,945 --> 00:03:03,129
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be like an MMORPG For the Harry Potter universe You know it'll happen I will be on that so fast We're going to talk about another MMO potential For lots of fanboys and girls tonight on the show

40
00:03:03,928 --> 00:03:04,188
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

41
00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:05,029
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

42
00:03:05,549 --> 00:03:05,849
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

43
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,451
[SPEAKER_01]: You're thinking the Oregon Trail thing, aren't you?

44
00:03:09,472 --> 00:03:11,633
[SPEAKER_03]: Oregon Trail, the MMORPG.

45
00:03:12,694 --> 00:03:14,855
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a reference to our three-hour show earlier this evening.

46
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:16,756
[SPEAKER_03]: Which you should all be listening to as well.

47
00:03:16,956 --> 00:03:19,298
[SPEAKER_01]: One of our callers brought up Oregon Trail, the MMO.

48
00:03:19,498 --> 00:03:20,278
[SPEAKER_01]: It should be a great idea.

49
00:03:20,298 --> 00:03:22,700
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to start an online petition and everything, so we'll see.

50
00:03:24,341 --> 00:03:28,804
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of online things, did you know that we got nominated for the Podcast Awards?

00:04:19,989 --> 00:04:21,450
[SPEAKER_01]: What games have you been playing this week, DarkSakura?

65
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:23,011
[SPEAKER_03]: Hardly any.

66
00:04:23,492 --> 00:04:28,055
[SPEAKER_03]: I played PSO once, and that's really about it.

67
00:04:28,335 --> 00:04:32,938
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no, I played Guitar Man today on my 50-inch widescreen HDTV.

68
00:04:33,779 --> 00:04:38,262
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like my entire range of vision was Guitar Man, and I suck at that game.

69
00:04:39,703 --> 00:04:43,406
[SPEAKER_03]: The Parapara level kicked my ass, and it's only the second level.

70
00:04:44,824 --> 00:04:46,545
[SPEAKER_01]: Guitaroman is a very strange music game.

71
00:04:46,585 --> 00:04:47,145
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very different.

72
00:04:47,466 --> 00:04:54,690
[SPEAKER_01]: The analog, like, in Guitaroman, of course, you're trying to play the guitar, and there's this one point where you move the analog stick very carefully, and you try to trace the pattern.

73
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:56,411
[SPEAKER_01]: It's harder than you'd think.

74
00:04:57,071 --> 00:05:00,494
[SPEAKER_01]: At least for me, but maybe I just have a fat thumb or something.

75
00:05:00,514 --> 00:05:03,415
[SPEAKER_03]: It's my first time actually playing the game, and I've owned it for two years.

76
00:05:04,716 --> 00:05:04,956
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

77
00:05:05,116 --> 00:05:06,037
[SPEAKER_03]: I unwrapped it last year.

78
00:05:08,032 --> 00:05:09,254
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for watching!

79
00:05:23,214 --> 00:05:26,076
[SPEAKER_02]: Namco Battle Collection I've been testing out, which has been pretty cool.

80
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:30,880
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely got all your retro favorites in there, plus the remade ones are really nice.

81
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,961
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the remade ones from the early 90s?

82
00:05:33,462 --> 00:05:36,884
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Pac-Man and Rally-X and stuff they had in the arcades?

83
00:05:37,284 --> 00:05:38,465
[SPEAKER_02]: No, these weren't in the arcades.

84
00:05:38,485 --> 00:05:41,147
[SPEAKER_02]: These were made specifically for the PSP.

85
00:05:41,427 --> 00:05:43,789
[SPEAKER_02]: They're really nice, they look pretty, and they play well.

86
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:44,650
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's good.

87
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:46,171
[SPEAKER_01]: I like retro upgrades.

88
00:05:46,271 --> 00:05:48,052
[SPEAKER_01]: I always liked Mario Lost Levels.

89
00:05:48,293 --> 00:05:48,773
[SPEAKER_01]: Or not Mario...

90
00:05:49,033 --> 00:05:50,054
[SPEAKER_01]: Mario All-Stars

91
00:06:06,019 --> 00:06:07,480
[SPEAKER_01]: It's with a K. Okay, good.

92
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,121
[SPEAKER_02]: K-O-L-L-O-N.

93
00:06:09,141 --> 00:06:09,361
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, good.

94
00:06:09,581 --> 00:06:10,481
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I could just see those chips.

95
00:06:10,501 --> 00:06:14,103
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been playing Colon, and it was pretty cool, and I've been trying that out and stuff.

96
00:06:14,403 --> 00:06:16,424
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait, wait, so a puzzle game you like on PSP?

97
00:06:16,444 --> 00:06:16,604
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

98
00:06:16,844 --> 00:06:17,465
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine that.

99
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:19,346
[SPEAKER_02]: There's really a lot of puzzle games coming out.

100
00:06:19,366 --> 00:06:26,289
[SPEAKER_02]: We got bashed on Mercury and Smart Bomb, so... Well, Mercury sucked, and Smart Bomb was not even finished.

101
00:06:26,809 --> 00:06:28,430
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, whatever.

102
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:29,671
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they just sucked.

103
00:06:29,711 --> 00:06:30,011
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyways...

104
00:06:30,413 --> 00:06:34,295
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been trying those, and then playing a little bit of Coated Arms and stuff, and it was pretty fun.

105
00:06:34,835 --> 00:06:38,776
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, just trying out the PSP games and stuff, whatever I can get my hands on.

106
00:06:39,737 --> 00:06:40,297
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, go figure.

107
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:42,458
[SPEAKER_01]: While Loki's been playing PSP, I've been playing DS.

108
00:06:42,538 --> 00:06:44,158
[SPEAKER_01]: I played two new DS games this week.

109
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:54,662
[SPEAKER_01]: First one I checked out was Puyo Puyo, the new DS version of Puyo Puyo, which it kind of did... For those of you guys that have played Puyo Puyo before, you might have played it and not even known it, because it was called...

110
00:06:56,713 --> 00:07:04,399
[SPEAKER_01]: Sonic, or no, Dr. Robotnik's Magic Bean Machine on Genesis, and then on Super Nintendo, it was Kirby's Avalanche.

111
00:07:04,739 --> 00:07:05,339
[SPEAKER_01]: Woo, I remembered.

112
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:06,060
[SPEAKER_01]: Kirby's Avalanche.

113
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,582
[SPEAKER_01]: Both of them were just different versions of Puyo Puyo.

114
00:07:08,902 --> 00:07:15,787
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they have this game now in its original kind of Japanese anime form on the DS, but they kind of changed the game a little bit.

115
00:07:15,807 --> 00:07:22,512
[SPEAKER_01]: They changed some of the mechanics, like they put fat pieces in them, like pieces that would usually be like, think of Super Gems from Puzzle Fighter 2.

116
00:07:23,312 --> 00:07:46,353
[SPEAKER_01]: That fall, like big red, they're like 2x2s, they're just like fat red pieces and stuff, you know, different colors So they changed some of the game mechanics, you know, keep it a little bit fresh Some of the rest of the game, though, is a little bit dorky Like they have the cutscenes where they're talking to each other and it's all anime style So they're all like cute little girls talking like this Except they talk very slow when they do their talking

117
00:07:46,758 --> 00:08:04,035
[SPEAKER_01]: so you know you're like sitting waiting waiting and it's kind of like why is it in a lot of these games when they're talking to each other back and forth they don't talk normally they slow down their speech like they're reading it line by line why is that so I don't know

118
00:08:04,485 --> 00:08:04,725
[SPEAKER_01]: Puyo Puyo

119
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:27,730
[SPEAKER_01]: Loving this.

120
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:31,811
[SPEAKER_01]: The new DS games are starting to be eight-player games off of one cartridge.

121
00:08:32,071 --> 00:08:34,992
[SPEAKER_01]: Bomberman, Meteos, not necessarily eight players, but four, you know.

122
00:08:35,912 --> 00:08:36,392
[SPEAKER_01]: Loving that.

123
00:08:36,472 --> 00:08:41,933
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm very happy to report that Puyo Puyo does the multi-player off one cartridge as well.

124
00:08:41,973 --> 00:08:42,393
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.

125
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:49,135
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, another DS game I checked out this week was Kirby's Canvas Curse, which has actually been out for about a month now, but I got it for my birthday.

126
00:08:49,255 --> 00:08:49,755
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Loki.

127
00:08:50,379 --> 00:09:00,558
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to admit, I didn't want to play this game at first because I had a bad feeling it was going to be like Yoshi Touch and Go, which if you listened to earlier podcasts, I did not like Yoshi Touch and Go.

128
00:09:00,578 --> 00:09:01,580
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was way too...

129
00:09:02,264 --> 00:09:03,365
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

130
00:09:27,071 --> 00:09:34,296
[SPEAKER_01]: You will like Kirby's Canvas Curse because there's way more interactivity and there's so many different levels and things to unlock.

131
00:09:34,716 --> 00:09:38,459
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're a Kirby fan, you're going to like it because it has the old music and the cute graphics.

132
00:09:38,739 --> 00:09:41,861
[SPEAKER_01]: But please note, this does not play like a normal Kirby game.

133
00:09:41,901 --> 00:09:43,042
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one thing you want to keep in mind.

134
00:09:43,422 --> 00:09:56,891
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Kirby Canvas Curse and basically Kirby sort of moves automatically and you can touch him with a stylus to make him roll faster or if he's killed an enemy, you can use the power like if you hit one of the stone guys, then tapping on Kirby will make him turn into a stone.

135
00:09:57,371 --> 00:09:59,872
[SPEAKER_01]: but it doesn't function like the other ones.

136
00:09:59,892 --> 00:10:03,433
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't suck in the enemies using your breath like you did in the old Kirby games.

137
00:10:03,813 --> 00:10:07,074
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't quite have that same gameplay element.

138
00:10:07,094 --> 00:10:16,616
[SPEAKER_01]: The gameplay is much different because you're drawing paths for Kirby to take, which I know sounds very simple, but it's actually kind of complicated and the level design is pretty smart in the game.

139
00:10:16,996 --> 00:10:19,277
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess that's kind of my review.

140
00:10:19,317 --> 00:10:21,897
[SPEAKER_01]: If you like Kirby the character, you'll like this game.

141
00:10:21,937 --> 00:10:23,838
[SPEAKER_01]: If you like Kirby the actual game,

142
00:10:24,358 --> 00:10:30,143
[SPEAKER_01]: You may want to rent or borrow this one first to make sure that the mechanics of the game are going to be something you enjoy.

143
00:10:30,443 --> 00:10:32,405
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you liked Touch and Go, you're going to like this one.

144
00:10:33,225 --> 00:10:34,686
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's my thought on Kirby Canvas Curse.

145
00:10:34,706 --> 00:10:38,870
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot to mention, I also played one more game called Glow Race Fantastic Carnival.

146
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:42,393
[SPEAKER_02]: It's some racing game that's in Korea for the PSP.

147
00:10:43,233 --> 00:10:43,694
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like it.

148
00:10:44,134 --> 00:10:44,494
[SPEAKER_02]: It was lame.

149
00:10:45,535 --> 00:10:46,236
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry to hear that.

150
00:10:46,636 --> 00:10:50,719
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a cheap version of Mario Kart that's not even close to being Mario Kart and just lame.

151
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:52,581
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't wait for Mario Kart DS, though.

152
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:56,989
[SPEAKER_01]: You know Mario Kart DS and Animal Crossing DS are going to have the online thing.

153
00:10:57,109 --> 00:10:58,370
[SPEAKER_01]: At least that's what they're saying right now.

154
00:10:58,510 --> 00:10:58,910
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope so.

155
00:10:59,030 --> 00:10:59,950
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't wait for that.

156
00:11:00,151 --> 00:11:01,131
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know it's going to happen.

157
00:11:01,151 --> 00:11:02,072
[SPEAKER_01]: They were showing it off at E3.

158
00:11:02,452 --> 00:11:10,476
[SPEAKER_01]: But what's interesting is that 1UP.com ran a story this week about Metroid Prime Hunters not having the online capability.

159
00:11:10,516 --> 00:11:14,738
[SPEAKER_01]: And just kind of, why didn't, you know, because this game's been delayed and delayed over and over again.

160
00:11:15,119 --> 00:11:17,920
[SPEAKER_01]: Why didn't they bother to add in the online capability?

161
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:18,500
[SPEAKER_01]: Because think about it.

162
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:21,162
[SPEAKER_01]: Metroid Prime Hunters would have been a lot of fun online.

163
00:11:21,842 --> 00:11:23,283
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's some quotes in the articles here.

164
00:11:23,944 --> 00:11:31,930
[SPEAKER_01]: The producer of the game, Kensuke Tanabe, says, Really, we could have made this game online, but Nintendo's version of online play is different from that of other companies.

165
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:35,612
[SPEAKER_01]: We wanted it to be free, easy, and easy to access for everybody.

166
00:11:35,913 --> 00:11:41,637
[SPEAKER_01]: To set up the kind of infrastructure that we needed, and to meet the launch date we have for this game, the two just didn't match.

167
00:11:42,942 --> 00:11:45,824
[SPEAKER_01]: And that makes me think, what was the launch date for this game?

168
00:11:45,844 --> 00:11:48,745
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, dang, it's been like a year since the DS came out.

169
00:11:48,945 --> 00:11:50,346
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, okay, maybe not quite that long.

170
00:11:50,366 --> 00:11:51,206
[SPEAKER_01]: It feels like a year.

171
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:55,588
[SPEAKER_01]: In reality, it's probably been, what, eight months or so since DS came out?

172
00:11:56,068 --> 00:12:02,652
[SPEAKER_01]: And Prime Hunters was the built-in demo, and I would think that the built-in demo would be the game that would be coming out within the first three months.

173
00:12:03,292 --> 00:12:04,953
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless it was just one hell of a teaser.

174
00:12:05,693 --> 00:12:07,494
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it basically ended up being.

175
00:12:08,014 --> 00:12:13,596
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, then they kind of, you know, try to soften the blow here about Metroid Prime Hunters not being online.

176
00:12:14,076 --> 00:12:20,958
[SPEAKER_01]: Richard Verrotti, game designer over at Nintendo, says, I don't think we look at it as a negative thing because we're not focusing on the internet.

177
00:12:20,978 --> 00:12:24,379
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got to focus on the Wi-Fi stuff so four players can jump in like that.

178
00:12:24,739 --> 00:12:28,460
[SPEAKER_01]: And if only one person has the game, well, you can download it too and then play with your friends.

179
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,141
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's going to be the perfect multiplayer game because of that.

180
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:33,531
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'll give them points for that.

181
00:12:33,651 --> 00:12:42,639
[SPEAKER_01]: I do like the fact on the DS you really get to sample a lot of games because it seems to be this running trend in a lot of games where you can play off of one cartridge and that at least is cool.

182
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,421
[SPEAKER_01]: But the internet thing would have been cool.

183
00:12:45,461 --> 00:12:48,144
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have liked to play some of our podcast listeners on the internet.

184
00:12:48,504 --> 00:12:49,345
[SPEAKER_02]: Metroid Maker

185
00:13:10,905 --> 00:13:11,606
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, like make your own?

186
00:13:11,946 --> 00:13:17,010
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone had done a map editor for Metroid, and someone has actually made a Metroid game out of it.

187
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:17,750
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a ROM hack thing?

188
00:13:18,451 --> 00:13:18,831
[SPEAKER_01]: Sort of.

189
00:13:19,111 --> 00:13:19,512
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool.

190
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:21,413
[SPEAKER_01]: I love Super Metroid.

191
00:13:21,453 --> 00:13:27,217
[SPEAKER_01]: I did not get into the 3D Metroids as much, but I love the DS one.

192
00:13:28,238 --> 00:13:30,820
[SPEAKER_01]: For some reason, the 3D thing works for me on that.

193
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,361
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why.

194
00:13:31,401 --> 00:13:34,863
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't look nearly as good as it does on GameCube, but for some reason, I like it.

195
00:13:35,003 --> 00:13:36,384
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what it is.

196
00:13:36,685 --> 00:13:37,025
[SPEAKER_01]: Go figure.

197
00:13:38,427 --> 00:13:40,088
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, so what do you guys think?

198
00:13:40,388 --> 00:13:41,588
[SPEAKER_01]: Online play on DS?

199
00:13:42,028 --> 00:13:45,190
[SPEAKER_01]: Something that more games should be looking at doing?

200
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:49,251
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see how these early ones do first before we start going.

201
00:13:49,311 --> 00:13:52,793
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get more online play because if it's going to suck, then no.

202
00:13:53,193 --> 00:13:53,433
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

203
00:13:54,141 --> 00:13:58,503
[SPEAKER_01]: We got a couple letters tonight sent to us via togo at orangeloungeradio.com.

204
00:13:58,524 --> 00:14:00,645
[SPEAKER_01]: That's T-O-G-O at orangeloungeradio.com.

205
00:14:00,685 --> 00:14:01,885
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thought we'd read a couple letters.

206
00:14:02,566 --> 00:14:05,828
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, we're getting a lot of mail, so we don't have time to answer everything.

207
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:07,989
[SPEAKER_01]: But DarkSakura, she does check that mailbox.

208
00:14:08,429 --> 00:14:12,331
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd reply to my mailbox, but all I'm getting is spam.

209
00:14:13,112 --> 00:14:14,853
[SPEAKER_03]: You need breast enhancement.

210
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:19,057
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently I do, because there's a lot of people sending me that info.

211
00:14:19,297 --> 00:14:22,317
[SPEAKER_03]: I still like that one webcomic you linked me to, Rob.

212
00:14:22,998 --> 00:14:23,578
[SPEAKER_03]: Spamusement.

213
00:14:23,598 --> 00:14:24,878
[SPEAKER_01]: That's hilarious.

214
00:14:25,098 --> 00:14:26,298
[SPEAKER_01]: I love Spamusement.

215
00:14:26,398 --> 00:14:29,419
[SPEAKER_01]: Seriously, I think it's the best webcomic out there.

216
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:30,579
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's so simple.

217
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:33,240
[SPEAKER_01]: Spamusement.com gets my full endorsement.

218
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:33,820
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that site.

219
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,300
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, let's open up the mailbag.

220
00:14:39,681 --> 00:14:40,281
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.

221
00:14:40,401 --> 00:14:42,021
[SPEAKER_01]: We got a fan letter here.

222
00:14:42,502 --> 00:14:44,062
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to read the Loki fan letter here.

223
00:14:45,185 --> 00:14:46,406
[SPEAKER_01]: This was from Same.

224
00:14:47,466 --> 00:14:54,890
[SPEAKER_01]: Same says he was catching up on some of the old podcasts while cleaning up around my room, and I was listening to the July 4th podcast, and I must say the following words.

225
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:55,890
[SPEAKER_01]: I loved it.

226
00:14:56,311 --> 00:14:57,171
[SPEAKER_01]: I am so serious.

227
00:14:57,331 --> 00:15:00,953
[SPEAKER_01]: Loki was hilarious, and I couldn't stop laughing every time he spoke.

228
00:15:01,013 --> 00:15:01,633
[SPEAKER_01]: Do it some more.

229
00:15:04,955 --> 00:15:05,975
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, guys.

230
00:15:06,856 --> 00:15:08,316
[SPEAKER_02]: That game was awful.

231
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:08,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously.

232
00:15:08,997 --> 00:15:09,417
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously.

233
00:15:10,158 --> 00:15:11,159
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really awful.

234
00:15:11,259 --> 00:15:13,380
[SPEAKER_01]: Seriously, it was awful.

235
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:17,462
[SPEAKER_01]: Loki, next time he drinks, he's going to be under strict monitoring when he drinks.

236
00:15:17,762 --> 00:15:19,063
[SPEAKER_01]: He barfed on the carpet.

237
00:15:19,223 --> 00:15:20,143
[SPEAKER_01]: It was disgusting.

238
00:15:20,303 --> 00:15:22,825
[SPEAKER_01]: I had 20 shots of vodka.

239
00:15:22,925 --> 00:15:23,805
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, what do you expect?

240
00:15:23,865 --> 00:15:25,646
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to be babysat next time you get drunk.

241
00:15:25,906 --> 00:15:27,747
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was a single shot glass.

242
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,908
[SPEAKER_01]: Drink responsibly, boys and girls.

243
00:15:30,969 --> 00:15:31,749
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't even think about it.

244
00:15:32,748 --> 00:15:34,829
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, let's get to another letter here.

245
00:15:35,209 --> 00:15:38,111
[SPEAKER_01]: This one is from... Does this person have a handle?

246
00:15:38,351 --> 00:15:39,272
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't see it in here.

247
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:41,153
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry if you had a handle and I missed it.

248
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:46,556
[SPEAKER_01]: This is from Brett, and Brett wants to know, I played Silent Hill 1 and 2.

249
00:15:46,976 --> 00:15:49,817
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought the second game was one of the best games available at the time.

250
00:15:50,218 --> 00:15:54,320
[SPEAKER_01]: I absolutely love Silent Hill 2, and then Silent Hill 3 popped its ugly head.

251
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:59,683
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't feeling the 17-year-old life-vesting wearing chick, and the game was a bit boring to me.

252
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:01,284
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I played about two hours of it.

253
00:16:01,764 --> 00:16:04,566
[SPEAKER_01]: My question is, Silent Hill 4, is it worth checking out?

254
00:16:04,967 --> 00:16:06,308
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that the movie is coming out soon.

255
00:16:06,368 --> 00:16:07,769
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a hot topic on the show.

256
00:16:08,129 --> 00:16:10,691
[SPEAKER_01]: So Silent Hill 4 is the only one of the series I haven't played yet.

257
00:16:10,771 --> 00:16:11,892
[SPEAKER_01]: Should I give it a whirl?

258
00:16:12,413 --> 00:16:13,233
[SPEAKER_01]: That's from Brett.

259
00:16:13,273 --> 00:16:13,994
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you guys think?

260
00:16:14,314 --> 00:16:15,395
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.

261
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:16,436
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.

262
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:17,437
[SPEAKER_01]: You think so?

263
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:18,057
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty good.

264
00:16:18,518 --> 00:16:19,799
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think, DarkSakura?

265
00:16:20,359 --> 00:16:21,680
[SPEAKER_01]: You've had my copy of Silent Hill 4.

266
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,361
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you've played it.

267
00:16:22,721 --> 00:16:23,702
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I have my own copy.

268
00:16:23,722 --> 00:16:24,783
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought I gave you yours back.

269
00:16:25,423 --> 00:16:25,864
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

270
00:16:26,124 --> 00:16:27,885
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'll find it sometime when I unpack.

271
00:16:28,226 --> 00:16:28,626
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool.

272
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:29,747
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think, though?

273
00:16:29,767 --> 00:16:30,948
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you recommend Silent Hill 4?

274
00:16:31,752 --> 00:16:33,594
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah.

275
00:16:34,615 --> 00:16:42,303
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, in my response that I had given back, I would say I told them to try Silent Hill 3 all the way through because it really does get a lot better.

276
00:16:43,143 --> 00:16:49,770
[SPEAKER_03]: But Silent Hill 4 is definitely from a male perspective and it's very, I think, unique to the series.

277
00:16:50,371 --> 00:16:50,711
[SPEAKER_01]: Very cool.

278
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:54,871
[SPEAKER_01]: I would definitely recommend Silent Hill 4.

279
00:16:55,591 --> 00:16:58,093
[SPEAKER_01]: To be honest, I haven't even really played Silent Hill 3.

280
00:17:00,034 --> 00:17:00,714
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm liking it.

281
00:17:00,774 --> 00:17:01,755
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like Silent Hill 3.

282
00:17:02,395 --> 00:17:08,999
[SPEAKER_01]: Silent Hill 4 is a continuation of the story from Silent Hill 2, so I don't see how it could really be a miss.

283
00:17:09,259 --> 00:17:11,020
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the soundtrack especially.

284
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:13,702
[SPEAKER_01]: The soundtrack, I think, is one of the best parts of the whole game.

285
00:17:13,762 --> 00:17:14,943
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I love about it.

286
00:17:16,864 --> 00:17:17,685
[SPEAKER_01]: At least rent it.

287
00:17:17,945 --> 00:17:19,227
[SPEAKER_01]: Do yourself a favor, rent it.

288
00:17:19,587 --> 00:17:22,851
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the idea of renting games is really great, so definitely check that out.

289
00:17:23,922 --> 00:17:27,023
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, and then one other letter we got from Mark.

290
00:17:28,124 --> 00:17:32,245
[SPEAKER_01]: And Mark actually lives in the UK and sent us a really great email.

291
00:17:32,265 --> 00:17:35,626
[SPEAKER_01]: It was so great, but it was kind of long, so I can't read the whole thing.

292
00:17:35,726 --> 00:17:38,287
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a follow-up to last week's podcast.

293
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:40,188
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember how we were talking about the rating system?

294
00:17:40,548 --> 00:17:43,769
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said that they should do it like they do the movies.

295
00:17:44,189 --> 00:17:48,651
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, in here, Mark writes, well, this is how it's done in the UK to an extent.

296
00:17:49,071 --> 00:18:04,922
[SPEAKER_01]: Game ratings in most of Europe are given out by the Pan-European Gaming Information, that's www.pegi.info, with ratings including 3+, 7+, 12, 16, and 18 printed on the boxes for each game, and often also accompanied by icons to describe the reasons for these ratings.

297
00:18:05,883 --> 00:18:11,366
[SPEAKER_01]: Although I don't believe the ratings are legally binding, retailers do tend to enforce the 16 and 18 ratings.

298
00:18:11,847 --> 00:18:14,849
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, most retailers will not stock a game without a PEGI rating,

299
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:18,464
[SPEAKER_01]: Although, again, I don't think there's a legal requirement for them to do so.

300
00:18:21,129 --> 00:18:49,084
[SPEAKER_01]: and then went on to say the ratings tend to be quite effective as the 15 and 18 ratings have been used on movies for a very long time so parents recognize the logos and understand the reasons for these ratings although then he linked us to an article that said that maybe the studies don't quite link up to that and then they were talking about, Mark was talking about the hysteria regarding hysteria about violent games in the UK a notable recent case involved a boy 14 getting murdered by an older teenager

301
00:18:49,444 --> 00:18:55,851
[SPEAKER_01]: It was reported that the older teenager had been inspired to kill the younger child by the gay Manhunt.

302
00:19:01,822 --> 00:19:04,323
[SPEAKER_01]: Very interesting to hear the UK perspective.

303
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:09,864
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Mark ends his letter by saying, maybe everyone would be more mellow if Katamari Damacy ever came out over here.

304
00:19:10,004 --> 00:19:11,905
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't even realize that game wasn't out over there.

305
00:19:12,185 --> 00:19:13,646
[SPEAKER_01]: Neither did I. You need that game.

306
00:19:13,706 --> 00:19:14,686
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys need that game.

307
00:19:14,926 --> 00:19:16,466
[SPEAKER_01]: Import that stuff or something.

308
00:19:16,686 --> 00:19:20,067
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I don't think they can because of the television difference, but... Hey, you know what?

309
00:19:20,127 --> 00:19:23,568
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of TVs come out now able to switch between PAL and NTSC.

310
00:19:23,728 --> 00:19:24,649
[SPEAKER_01]: Figure out a way to do it.

311
00:19:24,769 --> 00:19:25,509
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys need that game.

312
00:19:25,529 --> 00:19:25,829
[SPEAKER_01]: You're right.

313
00:19:25,869 --> 00:19:27,730
[SPEAKER_01]: People would mellow out if they could play some Katamari Damacy.

314
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:28,850
[SPEAKER_03]: Play it on a computer monitor.

315
00:19:30,019 --> 00:19:31,520
[SPEAKER_03]: No problem on a computer monitor.

316
00:19:32,281 --> 00:19:32,561
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

317
00:19:32,601 --> 00:19:34,402
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much, Mark, for your mail.

318
00:19:34,422 --> 00:19:35,103
[SPEAKER_01]: It was very nice.

319
00:19:35,283 --> 00:19:36,364
[SPEAKER_01]: I like getting the long mails.

320
00:19:36,464 --> 00:19:38,305
[SPEAKER_01]: It really shows they listen to us.

321
00:19:38,645 --> 00:19:39,106
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great.

322
00:19:40,086 --> 00:19:40,347
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

323
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:41,848
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to close up the mail bag again.

324
00:19:41,868 --> 00:19:45,150
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys have an email, togo at orangelaunchradio.com.

325
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:54,464
[SPEAKER_01]: The PlayStation 2 version of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, it was confirmed by GameSpot that it does have the hot coffee content.

326
00:19:55,104 --> 00:20:00,247
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's interesting because as we were saying last week, you have to mod your game to do this.

327
00:20:00,327 --> 00:20:13,494
[SPEAKER_01]: But apparently a sequence of codes have been discovered or something that will actually unlock this in the PlayStation 2 version of the game, which kind of goes, well, now is this a case of Rockstar was just lazy and didn't take the code out?

328
00:20:13,514 --> 00:20:13,554
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

329
00:20:13,954 --> 00:20:21,522
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, apparently it could be like, you know, the code pointing to it or whatever could be like, you know, truncated out or something like that.

330
00:20:21,663 --> 00:20:26,187
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, they just put one code in there to patch, you know, to rewrite the code.

331
00:20:27,469 --> 00:20:31,153
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't see how they're guilty for having this code in there if it's disabled.

332
00:20:31,213 --> 00:20:33,956
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's a lot of things that can be disabled in a game.

333
00:20:34,738 --> 00:20:35,679
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

334
00:20:57,865 --> 00:21:04,912
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't say I blame them 100% because not everybody's a gamer, and I don't think there's any senators that are video gamers, although if there are, that would be cool, and I would vote for them.

335
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:08,136
[SPEAKER_02]: She probably thinks that, you know, Bill Clinton slept with Monica.

336
00:21:08,156 --> 00:21:09,677
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, wait a minute, wait a minute.

337
00:21:09,717 --> 00:21:12,520
[SPEAKER_02]: Because he saw the whores in, you know, Grand Theft Auto.

338
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:13,081
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait a minute.

339
00:21:13,101 --> 00:21:15,022
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait a minute, it has nothing to do with it.

340
00:21:15,943 --> 00:21:16,344
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it?

341
00:21:17,262 --> 00:21:28,574
[SPEAKER_01]: I think people are thinking that this is actually in the game and was something hidden by the people who coded it as some type of secret feature.

342
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:31,777
[SPEAKER_01]: But that really doesn't seem to be the case when you look into it.

343
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:32,958
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, but do they do the research?

344
00:21:33,138 --> 00:21:33,399
[SPEAKER_01]: No!

345
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:34,640
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the problem.

346
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:37,323
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's why this whole thing is blown out of proportion.

347
00:21:37,383 --> 00:21:39,365
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think people have been doing the appropriate research.

348
00:21:39,745 --> 00:21:49,684
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'm hoping that that is the investigation they're going to do and that's what they're going to find out because what they want to find out did Rockstar release this game knowing that they were...

349
00:21:50,606 --> 00:21:56,369
[SPEAKER_01]: Marketing this as a mature game when it should have been adults only because this would be unlocked by somebody.

350
00:21:56,389 --> 00:21:57,149
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm saying no.

351
00:21:57,269 --> 00:21:59,230
[SPEAKER_01]: Some hacker went and figured out a way to do it.

352
00:21:59,711 --> 00:22:06,734
[SPEAKER_01]: And Rockstar was under the impression that that wouldn't happen because they had removed the code that points to the hot coffee mug.

353
00:22:07,675 --> 00:22:08,595
[SPEAKER_02]: And did they?

354
00:22:08,755 --> 00:22:09,376
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

355
00:22:10,854 --> 00:22:11,495
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

356
00:22:26,994 --> 00:22:31,677
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to see everything censored and everything, you know, hunky-dory Christian.

357
00:22:32,178 --> 00:22:37,821
[SPEAKER_01]: What I don't understand, this is something, you know, if you think about it, M would be like an R rating on a movie, right?

358
00:22:37,841 --> 00:22:40,403
[SPEAKER_01]: Because AO would be like the NC-17 rating, right?

359
00:22:40,843 --> 00:22:44,766
[SPEAKER_01]: And they want to say that this hot coffee mod should earn this game an adults-only rating.

360
00:22:44,866 --> 00:22:48,329
[SPEAKER_01]: But, my God, have you seen sex scenes in how many R-rated movies?

361
00:22:48,889 --> 00:22:51,010
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, should that really qualify this game for an AO rating?

362
00:22:51,551 --> 00:22:51,891
[SPEAKER_01]: Granted...

363
00:22:52,906 --> 00:22:57,851
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I myself am being a little ignorant here because I have not seen the mod myself, but I'm assuming how bad can it be?

364
00:22:57,891 --> 00:22:59,332
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pixelated, for God's sake.

365
00:22:59,372 --> 00:23:00,233
[SPEAKER_01]: How bad can it be?

366
00:23:00,893 --> 00:23:01,154
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?

367
00:23:02,435 --> 00:23:02,735
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

368
00:23:02,755 --> 00:23:09,481
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it is pretty graphic, but it's not too graphic to the point where I'd say it'd be... Are there money shots?

369
00:23:10,181 --> 00:23:10,842
[SPEAKER_02]: No, there's...

370
00:23:11,637 --> 00:23:12,857
[SPEAKER_02]: There's pixelated boobies.

371
00:23:13,198 --> 00:23:15,918
[SPEAKER_02]: But still, look at God of War.

372
00:23:16,299 --> 00:23:18,119
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a sex minigame in that game.

373
00:23:18,919 --> 00:23:22,220
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's boobies that are not pixelated.

374
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,821
[SPEAKER_02]: They're out there saying, hello.

375
00:23:24,241 --> 00:23:28,903
[SPEAKER_02]: And he basically says, hey, thanks to this group, get off my fucking boat.

376
00:23:29,043 --> 00:23:31,823
[SPEAKER_02]: And that game was an M-rated game, right?

377
00:23:31,903 --> 00:23:32,404
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it was.

378
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:33,604
[SPEAKER_01]: And not AO.

379
00:23:33,884 --> 00:23:34,384
[SPEAKER_02]: Not AO.

380
00:23:34,524 --> 00:23:34,964
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

381
00:23:35,965 --> 00:23:39,326
[SPEAKER_02]: It's because there's penetration in it or something.

382
00:23:39,366 --> 00:23:39,446
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

383
00:23:41,405 --> 00:23:41,826
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh noes.

384
00:23:42,987 --> 00:23:47,451
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody that's learned about the birds and the bees knows that when we're talking about sex, penetration's involved.

385
00:23:48,152 --> 00:23:50,615
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, come on, there's a freaking dildo weapon in this game.

386
00:23:50,655 --> 00:23:50,875
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean...

387
00:23:51,542 --> 00:23:52,523
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

388
00:24:12,365 --> 00:24:13,146
[SPEAKER_02]: Grand Theft Auto

389
00:24:37,697 --> 00:24:43,179
[SPEAKER_01]: I realize that there's very mature 14, 15, 16 year olds out there that can probably handle it.

390
00:24:43,319 --> 00:24:46,060
[SPEAKER_01]: I know 14 year olds that are more mature than some 32 year olds I know.

391
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:46,381
[SPEAKER_01]: Contract.

392
00:24:46,881 --> 00:24:47,681
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a contract.

393
00:24:47,921 --> 00:24:51,123
[SPEAKER_02]: Because when you're buying this for the fucking people, make them sign a contract.

394
00:24:51,183 --> 00:24:57,025
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's their parents buying it for them, say, I understand what is in this game and I understand it, blah, blah, blah, blah.

395
00:24:57,325 --> 00:25:02,712
[SPEAKER_02]: and then that way if their son goes and murders somebody and they blame it on Grand Theft Auto No, no, no, no, no!

396
00:25:02,732 --> 00:25:06,056
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you understood what you were getting into so that's your own damn fault.

397
00:25:06,437 --> 00:25:07,138
[SPEAKER_02]: Bad parent.

398
00:25:07,398 --> 00:25:07,879
[SPEAKER_02]: Bad.

399
00:25:09,661 --> 00:25:09,981
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

400
00:25:12,004 --> 00:25:13,566
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure we'll get some emails on that one.

401
00:25:14,195 --> 00:25:16,958
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go to a happy, family-friendly story, shall we?

402
00:25:16,978 --> 00:25:18,219
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk about Worms!

403
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:19,700
[SPEAKER_01]: A nice game about Worms.

404
00:25:19,961 --> 00:25:21,902
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh wait, these Worms have guns and blow each other up.

405
00:25:21,943 --> 00:25:23,284
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess this isn't so family-friendly.

406
00:25:23,484 --> 00:25:24,065
[SPEAKER_01]: I like Worms.

407
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:26,046
[SPEAKER_01]: But Worms is coming to the PSP and DS.

408
00:25:26,387 --> 00:25:31,532
[SPEAKER_01]: I liked Worms when it was called Scorched Earth, and it was out on the PC like 10 years, 15 years ago.

409
00:25:31,912 --> 00:25:35,416
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, Scorched Earth is actually being ported to the PSP.

410
00:25:35,556 --> 00:25:36,056
[SPEAKER_01]: It already has.

411
00:25:36,416 --> 00:25:36,897
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.

412
00:25:38,423 --> 00:25:43,227
[SPEAKER_01]: THQ today announced that it will publish two new Worms games for the DS and the PSP.

413
00:25:43,287 --> 00:25:49,212
[SPEAKER_01]: No release date set yet, but is it really any surprise that Worms is coming out on the DS and the PSP?

414
00:25:49,332 --> 00:25:49,733
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably not.

415
00:25:49,873 --> 00:25:56,118
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, but THQ, I want my $5 back because the cell phone game version of Worms sucked ass.

416
00:25:59,161 --> 00:26:00,222
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought this was interesting.

417
00:26:01,187 --> 00:26:05,168
[SPEAKER_01]: Sega, it is rumored that their new arcade board is actually based on the Xbox 360.

418
00:26:05,268 --> 00:26:06,589
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I heard that.

419
00:26:06,749 --> 00:26:14,371
[SPEAKER_01]: The distributors in Japan are saying that the Lindbergh system, which is Sega's new system, their new arcade board, it does use the 360 architecture.

420
00:26:15,051 --> 00:26:15,692
[SPEAKER_01]: Very interesting.

421
00:26:15,712 --> 00:26:23,034
[SPEAKER_01]: And this, by the way, would be the second time that a Microsoft console has been the inspiration for a Sega arcade cabinet.

422
00:26:23,493 --> 00:26:26,674
[SPEAKER_01]: The Chihiro board was based on the current Xbox.

423
00:26:27,074 --> 00:26:30,914
[SPEAKER_02]: You mean it's not the third time that that's happened since there's only even, I don't know, two systems?

424
00:26:31,634 --> 00:26:35,815
[SPEAKER_02]: So this logically can only be the second time?

425
00:26:36,015 --> 00:26:38,676
[SPEAKER_01]: Just reporting what's on the internet out there.

426
00:26:39,356 --> 00:26:40,896
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, you're a Sega fangirl.

427
00:26:40,916 --> 00:26:41,636
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think of this one?

428
00:26:42,516 --> 00:26:48,137
[SPEAKER_01]: Sega teaming up with, well, not necessarily teaming up with Microsoft, but certainly using a lot of their stuff.

429
00:26:49,137 --> 00:26:52,278
[SPEAKER_03]: As long as they're using them and not climbing into bed with them, I'm happy.

430
00:26:52,658 --> 00:26:52,858
[SPEAKER_02]: You know,

431
00:26:53,627 --> 00:27:02,631
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes sense, though, because look at, like, for instance, I saw an article on Project Gotham Racing 3, near photorealistic imagery that's in that game.

432
00:27:02,711 --> 00:27:06,032
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's just amazing just the quality graphics that can be pushed out by this board.

433
00:27:06,393 --> 00:27:08,433
[SPEAKER_02]: More power to them if they want to make an arcade game like that.

434
00:27:08,533 --> 00:27:10,954
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait a minute, did I just hear you say something nice about the Xbox?

435
00:27:12,055 --> 00:27:13,496
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, about the Xbox 360.

436
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:16,477
[SPEAKER_01]: Can somebody please note the date and time?

437
00:27:17,555 --> 00:27:18,256
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a miracle.

438
00:27:18,276 --> 00:27:18,657
[SPEAKER_02]: About the 360.

439
00:27:19,398 --> 00:27:25,726
[SPEAKER_02]: I still dislike the fact that one of the selling points is custom faceplates because that's retarded, but whatever.

440
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:30,653
[SPEAKER_01]: It's aimed at that same market that watches Pimp My Ride.

441
00:27:30,673 --> 00:27:31,194
[SPEAKER_01]: What can I say?

442
00:27:32,432 --> 00:27:34,833
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of the Xbox 360, I have one more quick story on this.

443
00:27:35,693 --> 00:27:47,397
[SPEAKER_01]: Marvel said this week, and this is of course at the Comic Con convention, they unveiled this, they have an exclusive agreement with Microsoft to produce MMORPGs that will be on the Xbox 360.

444
00:27:49,697 --> 00:28:00,380
[SPEAKER_01]: Spider-Man, MMORPGs, Fantastic Four, X-Men, Iron Man, only on Xbox 360 and MMORPG 4.

445
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:02,560
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be a Marvel Universe MMO.

446
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:16,203
[SPEAKER_02]: This is no surprise because they actually filed lawsuits against the people that did the Super Heroes City of Heroes because of their character generator people were using to create likenesses of characters that looked

447
00:28:16,423 --> 00:28:17,084
[SPEAKER_02]: Very similar to this.

448
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:24,070
[SPEAKER_02]: And they said that that would cause... That would kind of put a dent in the being able to create an MMO featuring Marvel characters.

449
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:25,851
[SPEAKER_02]: So we knew this was coming.

450
00:28:25,891 --> 00:28:26,832
[SPEAKER_02]: But, yeah.

451
00:28:27,032 --> 00:28:28,894
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, DC's doing theirs, so why not?

452
00:28:29,214 --> 00:28:31,196
[SPEAKER_01]: Sony Online is working with DC.

453
00:28:31,216 --> 00:28:33,558
[SPEAKER_01]: That was announced earlier, so that's just kind of interesting.

454
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:37,482
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, that's kind of what I thought when I first heard this.

455
00:28:37,502 --> 00:28:39,383
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, don't we already have a game called City of Heroes?

456
00:28:39,844 --> 00:28:41,465
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, there's...

457
00:28:42,711 --> 00:28:42,951
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

458
00:28:43,031 --> 00:28:43,352
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

459
00:29:08,593 --> 00:29:14,778
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, follow up to your lawsuit there, NCSoft had a little bit of a victory there because the judge threw out a lot of Marvel's complaints.

460
00:29:14,918 --> 00:29:16,599
[SPEAKER_01]: Just so you know.

461
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,161
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, moving on.

462
00:29:19,461 --> 00:29:21,503
[SPEAKER_01]: Loki, why don't you tell us what's going on in the Hack and Crack world?

463
00:29:22,364 --> 00:29:23,064
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of stuff.

464
00:29:23,525 --> 00:29:25,026
[SPEAKER_02]: First off, PSP stuff.

465
00:29:25,086 --> 00:29:28,769
[SPEAKER_02]: They have released the brand new loader for the PSP

466
00:29:30,252 --> 00:29:34,075
[SPEAKER_02]: UMD RIPs, it's 2.5E or something like that.

467
00:29:34,095 --> 00:29:44,843
[SPEAKER_02]: It allows the new RIPs to play, or most of the games to play with Wi-Fi and sound, because I guess the PRX files, they're like these library files, kind of like on Windows, where you have to get a lot of files.

468
00:29:44,983 --> 00:29:52,108
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, library files are being loaded now, so you can do Wi-Fi in a lot of games, and you can also overclock the games as well, which was kind of neat.

469
00:29:52,889 --> 00:29:53,730
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was one of the things.

470
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:58,133
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing that came out, which was really cool, was the SCUMM VM PSP Beta.

471
00:29:58,793 --> 00:30:05,799
[SPEAKER_02]: and for those who don't know SCUM stands for um what was it it was uh oh man

472
00:30:06,178 --> 00:30:06,618
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember.

473
00:30:06,658 --> 00:30:15,925
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, it's the programming language that they use to write games like Maniac Mansion and Monkey Island and those wonderful games, LucasArts games.

474
00:30:16,366 --> 00:30:18,547
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, you can actually play these games now.

475
00:30:18,607 --> 00:30:22,370
[SPEAKER_02]: You can put this file on there and play all your PC games.

476
00:30:22,671 --> 00:30:23,891
[SPEAKER_01]: Those LucasArts games were awesome.

477
00:30:23,992 --> 00:30:25,313
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, they were awesome.

478
00:30:25,633 --> 00:30:28,195
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can play those, and that was really cool.

479
00:30:29,796 --> 00:30:32,118
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, also, the other thing that came out...

480
00:30:34,986 --> 00:30:37,949
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

481
00:30:57,445 --> 00:30:57,765
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds good.

482
00:31:22,017 --> 00:31:24,519
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, what are you going to be giving us advice about tonight?

483
00:31:52,584 --> 00:31:54,345
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people may not want to escape when tied up.

484
00:31:54,445 --> 00:31:58,007
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, we need to stay PG rated tonight.

485
00:31:58,127 --> 00:31:58,407
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.

486
00:31:59,227 --> 00:32:00,588
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, he already dropped the F-bomb.

487
00:32:00,928 --> 00:32:02,469
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, fuck what he did, okay?

488
00:32:02,729 --> 00:32:03,449
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, sorry.

489
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:09,712
[SPEAKER_03]: Number one, when your captors start binding you, expand your body as much as possible.

490
00:32:10,152 --> 00:32:13,474
[SPEAKER_03]: Take a deep breath, puff out your chest, and pull your shoulders back.

491
00:32:14,808 --> 00:32:16,989
[SPEAKER_03]: 2.

492
00:32:15,468 --> 00:32:16,989
[SPEAKER_03]: Flex your arms against the bonds.

493
00:32:17,169 --> 00:32:18,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Push against the bonds as much as possible.

494
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:18,890
3.

495
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:23,051
[SPEAKER_03]: Once your captors leave, suck in your chest and stomach.

496
00:32:23,071 --> 00:32:25,192
[SPEAKER_03]: Wriggle free with the extra room you have given yourself.

497
00:32:25,812 --> 00:32:27,533
[SPEAKER_03]: But my final bit of advice.

498
00:32:28,033 --> 00:32:28,273
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

499
00:32:29,574 --> 00:32:31,655
[SPEAKER_03]: This bondage party is sick, man.

500
00:32:31,715 --> 00:32:32,095
[SPEAKER_03]: Sick.

501
00:32:35,736 --> 00:32:36,137
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

502
00:32:36,797 --> 00:32:39,598
[SPEAKER_01]: And with that, DarkSakura, are you on your way out?

503
00:32:40,757 --> 00:32:41,717
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I must.

504
00:32:42,277 --> 00:32:43,758
[SPEAKER_01]: The man has the car today.

505
00:32:44,058 --> 00:32:44,398
[SPEAKER_02]: I see.

506
00:32:44,618 --> 00:32:44,938
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

507
00:32:45,058 --> 00:32:53,299
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd recommend you also don't try to get out your bondages with a lighter because you might set fire to the whole Nazi castle like in Indiana Jones.

508
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:56,280
[SPEAKER_02]: Shut up.

509
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:57,620
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

510
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,741
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, your final thought then before you take off.

511
00:33:00,941 --> 00:33:01,881
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck your Yankee blue jeans.

512
00:33:02,281 --> 00:33:02,641
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

513
00:33:02,761 --> 00:33:03,601
[SPEAKER_03]: Reject false icons.

514
00:33:04,341 --> 00:33:04,561
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

515
00:33:04,601 --> 00:33:05,361
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye, DarkSakura.

516
00:33:05,561 --> 00:33:06,041
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.

517
00:33:06,102 --> 00:33:06,842
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for playing.

518
00:33:06,862 --> 00:33:08,582
[SPEAKER_03]: Have fun storming the castle.

519
00:33:09,432 --> 00:33:10,133
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not done just yet.

520
00:33:10,173 --> 00:33:13,035
[SPEAKER_01]: We have another couple quick stories for you guys, then we're going to make it a wrap.

521
00:33:13,756 --> 00:33:14,616
[SPEAKER_01]: PlayStation 3.

522
00:33:15,897 --> 00:33:19,541
[SPEAKER_01]: You remember how PlayStation 3 was originally supposed to double as a router as well?

523
00:33:20,341 --> 00:33:20,621
[SPEAKER_01]: It was?

524
00:33:20,942 --> 00:33:21,222
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

525
00:33:21,422 --> 00:33:23,164
[SPEAKER_01]: It was originally going to double as a router.

526
00:33:23,864 --> 00:33:25,285
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, kids, not anymore.

527
00:33:25,626 --> 00:33:27,067
[SPEAKER_01]: It's no longer going to be a router.

528
00:33:27,087 --> 00:33:31,991
[SPEAKER_01]: They have quietly dropped over at Sony the PlayStation 3 router functionality.

529
00:33:32,031 --> 00:33:35,013
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was going to, of course, make your PlayStation 3 able to function as a router.

530
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:35,694
[SPEAKER_01]: Well...

531
00:33:37,074 --> 00:33:44,576
[SPEAKER_02]: I can understand why they had it function as a router, because I was looking at the pictures of it, and there's like three Ethernet ports, and I'm like, what the hell is that for?

532
00:33:44,596 --> 00:33:47,116
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like 5,000 ports on the back of a PlayStation 3.

533
00:33:47,396 --> 00:33:51,117
[SPEAKER_02]: But Ethernet ports, I'm like, what the hell do they need three Ethernet ports for?

534
00:33:51,157 --> 00:33:53,337
[SPEAKER_02]: I just didn't understand that, but whatever.

535
00:33:53,357 --> 00:33:57,578
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, now you've got to wonder, are they even going to be the Ethernet ports anymore, if they're getting rid of the networks?

536
00:33:57,598 --> 00:33:58,578
[SPEAKER_02]: That is pretty blank.

537
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:06,140
[SPEAKER_02]: So are they going to remove functionality, like will they not be able to play games pretty soon, because they've removed the hard drive, they've removed, you know,

538
00:34:06,701 --> 00:34:27,155
[SPEAKER_01]: This, they removed, what else, I mean Here's a hint, Sony, remove the boomerang Your old controller was just fine Seriously Don't try to improve on something that's already good Alright You know, but the rumor is that the Revolution is still going to have this router capability with it That would be cool

539
00:34:27,489 --> 00:34:27,669
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

540
00:34:27,789 --> 00:34:30,172
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't, I don't, but, but, oh well, we'll see.

541
00:34:30,572 --> 00:34:30,933
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see.

542
00:34:31,273 --> 00:34:32,474
[SPEAKER_01]: We can speculate all we want.

543
00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:35,197
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought they were releasing their own, like, router or something.

544
00:34:35,217 --> 00:34:36,218
[SPEAKER_01]: Nintendo's router.

545
00:34:36,299 --> 00:34:36,539
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows?

546
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:36,739
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows?

547
00:34:36,759 --> 00:34:38,301
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know until they start showing the goods.

548
00:34:38,441 --> 00:34:39,402
[SPEAKER_01]: Rumors, rumors until then.

549
00:34:40,808 --> 00:34:41,769
[SPEAKER_01]: Last story tonight.

550
00:34:42,209 --> 00:34:46,473
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting report over on bmjjournals.com.

551
00:34:46,813 --> 00:34:50,416
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a site that's dedicated to, like, it's like a health care archive.

552
00:34:51,357 --> 00:34:52,938
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of has a lot of reports.

553
00:34:53,018 --> 00:34:56,561
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the General Medical Journal website is what they call it on their main page.

554
00:34:57,642 --> 00:35:00,064
[SPEAKER_01]: They had an article recently about video games and health.

555
00:35:00,084 --> 00:35:09,251
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want to look this up, bmjjournals.com, talking about how video games can be used in the treating of cancer patients, which kind of makes you go, well, that's kind of weird.

556
00:35:10,425 --> 00:35:17,587
[SPEAKER_01]: You wouldn't think of that, but sure enough, they say in the report here, one innovative application of video games in healthcare is their use in pain management.

557
00:35:18,007 --> 00:35:26,990
[SPEAKER_01]: The degree of attention needed to play such a game can distract the player from the sensation of pain, a strategy that has been reported and evaluated amongst pediatric patients.

558
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:32,152
[SPEAKER_01]: One case study reported the use of a handheld video game to stop an eight-year-old boy from peeking at his face.

559
00:35:32,712 --> 00:35:37,374
[SPEAKER_01]: because, you know, he had this disease that was causing him to want to, you know, pick at his face and stuff.

560
00:35:37,695 --> 00:35:42,897
[SPEAKER_01]: So just kind of interesting, video games taking your mind off of other things being used as actual medical treatment.

561
00:35:43,197 --> 00:35:48,400
[SPEAKER_01]: So what a nice follow-up to have to the, you know, video games are evil story that we had earlier in the show.

562
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:55,123
[SPEAKER_02]: It sure beats the, you know, dog cone collar for, like, you know, people are trying to pick their face.

563
00:35:55,143 --> 00:35:56,204
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that's right.

564
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:59,786
[SPEAKER_02]: But, yeah, I guess that's good.

565
00:35:59,846 --> 00:36:00,406
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know.

566
00:36:01,567 --> 00:36:03,108
[SPEAKER_02]: Laura Croft fights cancer

567
00:36:31,428 --> 00:36:33,329
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I gotta play some more games.

568
00:36:33,369 --> 00:36:40,634
[SPEAKER_02]: There's... I'm trying to... I gotta work on some Killer7 and hopefully they're gonna port ZZT over.

569
00:36:40,914 --> 00:36:42,395
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, you know what the next thing I gotta do is?

570
00:36:42,716 --> 00:36:46,118
[SPEAKER_02]: I gotta make some hacked ROMs and put them in my Nintendo Emulator.

571
00:36:47,199 --> 00:36:50,681
[SPEAKER_01]: And my final thought is, I'm gonna go play on my new HDTV.

572
00:36:50,841 --> 00:36:52,302
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna go play 2DX widescreen.

573
00:36:53,523 --> 00:36:53,803
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.

574
00:36:55,344 --> 00:36:58,226
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, thanks for tuning in to us and subscribing to our podcast.

575
00:36:58,246 --> 00:37:01,128
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see you next week with more Orange Lounge Radio to go.

576
00:37:02,631 --> 00:37:06,193
