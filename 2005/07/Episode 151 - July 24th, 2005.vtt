00:30.000 --> 00:41.840
Windmill, windmill for the land Love forever, hand in hand

00:41.840 --> 00:48.800
Take it or lay it on your stride It is taking for all in land

00:48.800 --> 00:55.680
Love forever, love is free Let's turn forever, you and me

00:55.680 --> 01:03.280
Windmill, windmill for the land it's everybody in

01:06.100 --> 01:08.000
Go shop, shitty dudes

01:08.000 --> 01:11.180
Sleep by your cab, little city watching Savagrid

01:13.060 --> 01:14.920
Go shop, shitty dudes

01:14.920 --> 01:17.960
Levi, the captain said his baby wants to travel big

The following live program is a special presentation

01:49.820 --> 02:06.020

02:06.020 --> 02:12.540
It is time for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio on tonight's program.

02:12.540 --> 02:16.480
We're going to talk about another podcast that we fully endorse that you all should

us!

02:26.080 --> 02:27.080
This should be interesting.

02:27.080 --> 02:28.480
This is brand new, by the way.

02:28.480 --> 02:32.520
I have not even looked at this, well, I saw it when it was on TV, but I have not looked

02:32.520 --> 02:35.880
at the digitized format of it, so we're going to check that out very soon.

02:35.880 --> 02:39.360
And remember, kids, podcasting is fun.

02:39.360 --> 02:46.360
We'll be back after this.

03:39.360 --> 03:41.360
Oh, my god.

03:43.360 --> 03:45.360
Oh, god.

04:11.360 --> 04:13.360

04:43.020 --> 04:50.700
This is episode number 151 for this July the 24th, 2005.

04:50.700 --> 04:55.600
You're tuned in to Orange Lounge Radio, radio that gamers really want, and this is Orange

04:55.600 --> 04:56.860
Lounge Radio Live.

04:56.860 --> 05:00.780
home for all the news and discussion on rhythm and music games as well as the

05:00.780 --> 05:04.900
gamer community and the pop culture world. We're plugged in and fully

05:04.900 --> 05:11.260
interactive through our website at www.orangeloungeradio.com. My name is Rob

05:11.260 --> 05:15.740
Roberts, you might know me as Sky. Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts. In

05:15.740 --> 05:19.980
this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm, Miss Jamie Summers, also known as

05:19.980 --> 05:28.460
dark Sakura actually she's not here she's uh she's running a little late

05:28.460 --> 05:31.580
tonight she had some family business she had to take care of hopefully

05:31.580 --> 05:35.380
everything's okay but she's going to be here a little bit later on just you know

05:35.380 --> 05:42.080
however we do have the one and only Loki I am here and not in the cushion

05:42.080 --> 05:46.220
obviously that was very good timing by the way finding your microphone well

05:46.220 --> 05:50.220
Well, Jamie should be sitting on both of the microphones then.

05:50.220 --> 05:54.220
I'm not sure. It probably got put there during the party last night. We had a little bit of a house party last night.

05:54.220 --> 05:58.220
Maybe I shouldn't be talking with this microphone against my mouth.

05:58.220 --> 06:02.220
Is that the loud sensitive one?

06:02.220 --> 06:06.220
I don't know. Who knows? No? Anyway. Alright. So, Loki's here and then

06:06.220 --> 06:10.220
special guest wise we have nobody. I don't know. What the hell happened?

06:10.220 --> 06:14.220
We used to have special guests here every single week. There'd be somebody here and lately

06:14.220 --> 06:18.220
Nobody loves us anymore. Is it because we're in this new place? I don't get it.

06:18.220 --> 06:21.220
Something's weird. Can they give him bad directions?

06:21.220 --> 06:25.220
I guess so. It's like I lied to him about where I live or something. I don't know.

06:25.220 --> 06:30.220
Oh well. Fine. See if we care. We'll just sit here and do the show ourselves.

06:30.220 --> 06:32.220
So we have some fun stuff to talk about tonight.

06:32.220 --> 06:37.220
We were famous this week. Well, you know, we're always famous.

06:37.220 --> 06:42.220
No, we were on local news this week, so we have to show that clip later in the show.

06:42.220 --> 06:46.380
the show which makes for great radio by the way showing video clips but even the

06:46.380 --> 06:52.700
audio of it's gonna be pretty funny Loki's bit in it is priceless love it so

06:52.700 --> 06:56.020
we'll be airing that for you guys and telling you guys how you can get a copy

06:56.020 --> 06:59.660
of the video because some of you guys are asking just like publish media to

06:59.660 --> 07:04.940
you get the best of me yes last time when we were in the paper it was your

07:04.940 --> 07:10.660
foot more of my foot in this one too they actually flow we'll get to that

07:10.660 --> 07:12.460
Yeah, we'll get to that a little later.

07:12.460 --> 07:14.860
Also, we gotta talk about our buddy Midihead.

07:14.860 --> 07:18.060
He's been doing some fun stuff this week.

07:18.060 --> 07:20.900
And we'll play a little clip of his new UltraMix 3 song, too.

07:20.900 --> 07:22.540
I don't wanna play the whole thing,

07:22.540 --> 07:24.360
cause people gotta go check this thing out

07:24.360 --> 07:26.380
where you are supposed to be getting it,

07:26.380 --> 07:28.820
but we'll play a little clip of the new UltraMix 3 song

07:28.820 --> 07:29.660
for those that haven't heard it.

07:29.660 --> 07:31.180
It'll be fun.

07:31.180 --> 07:33.260
So, we'll be back after this little break.

07:33.260 --> 07:35.260
In this break, since I just woke up from a nap,

07:35.260 --> 07:36.840
I thought I'd play some really annoying,

07:36.840 --> 07:38.820
fast music that'll wake me up.

07:38.820 --> 07:42.820
So we're going to start it off with Cartoon Heroes, one of the most annoying songs I could think of.

07:42.820 --> 07:46.340
Enjoy, kids! We'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.

08:12.820 --> 08:17.820
We do the things you want to be, brain by brain, to the X-rays

08:18.820 --> 08:23.820
Our friends are so unreasonable, they do the unpredictable

08:23.820 --> 08:29.820
All out alive if we can say what we do and what we wish to do

08:29.820 --> 08:34.820
There's no line or best for our friends, do it all through the end of the day

08:34.820 --> 08:40.820
Brain by brain to the X-rays, one by one, we're making it fun

08:40.820 --> 08:46.620
We are the stars, you're heroes of the world We are the ones who fall in love and fall in love

08:46.620 --> 08:48.820
We're singing by your back, raise your mind

08:48.820 --> 08:52.220
Oh, the ones that are bad, they are the ones that are bad

08:52.220 --> 08:55.220
You can't fight back, we're running from the other side

08:55.220 --> 08:57.820
Come to the, to the party

08:57.820 --> 09:00.820
We come to the party, we'll never, never let back

09:00.820 --> 09:03.280
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

09:30.820 --> 09:46.420
This is your night, you make me cry I need to lighten up, save my life

09:46.420 --> 09:53.540
I need you while I'm dancing with Listen to the bells and the melody

10:23.540 --> 10:26.600
You'll be gonna think you're lying

10:53.540 --> 11:01.860
People give you my life in music You've been waiting tonight, you're crazy

11:01.860 --> 11:06.740
Bada-bada, deep in my heart I must've took you super star

11:06.740 --> 11:13.860
You know that you can love me, give me energy When I'm dancing on stage, you make me feel free

11:13.860 --> 11:18.820
There's a devotion, and if I dance, I'll kiss you every night

11:48.820 --> 12:16.820
New York City lights New York City lights

12:16.820 --> 12:17.820
This is life

12:17.820 --> 12:18.820
We love America

12:18.820 --> 12:20.820
That's a practical place

12:20.820 --> 12:21.820
Can't you see me now?

12:21.820 --> 12:22.820
Who laughs?

12:22.820 --> 12:23.820
They got nice

12:23.820 --> 12:24.820
You mean it to me now?

12:24.820 --> 12:25.820
Love Miami Fife

12:25.820 --> 12:27.820
A little in my life

12:27.820 --> 12:28.820

12:28.820 --> 12:29.820
Got to see your life

Got lots to say on

12:31.820 --> 12:32.820
You're gonna pick my heart

12:32.820 --> 12:34.820
Bang, bang, bang

12:34.820 --> 12:35.820
We're living in the old

12:35.820 --> 12:37.820
Don't laugh at my hand

12:37.820 --> 12:17.820
I'm at the

12:38.820 --> 12:41.820
Living in America

12:41.820 --> 12:43.820
Living in America

12:43.820 --> 12:44.820
This is never

13:14.820 --> 13:44.680
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

13:44.680 --> 13:52.000
I think I threw up in my mouth a little bit during that last break, and we had some vomit-inducing

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
songs.

13:53.000 --> 13:57.120
Admit it, there's at least one song you hated in that last break.

13:57.120 --> 14:01.360
I think during that break, we'd have people in the chat room be like, oh, I love that

14:01.360 --> 14:03.880
song, and then there'd be other people going, god, I hate that song, and then during the

14:03.880 --> 14:06.680
next song, it would switch around.

14:06.680 --> 14:13.040
Cartoon Heroes by Barbie Young, Speed Over Beethoven by Rose, Nori Nori Nori, Judy Crystal,

14:13.040 --> 14:17.320
Living in America from DDR Max 2 and I don't remember the artist on that cuz

14:17.320 --> 14:21.200
I'm too lazy to look it up and I never play that song so I don't remember oh

14:21.200 --> 14:27.280
well anyway um so we're here with another show oh hello

14:27.280 --> 14:33.920
there's the lovely Dark Sakura she's here and we were about ready to chat

14:33.920 --> 14:37.240
about what's going on in the Bamani world actually before that though we

14:37.240 --> 14:39.800
always have to start off each week show with a little bit of how was your week

14:39.800 --> 14:44.800
How was your day? And DarkSakura just joined us. She usually starts us off, so...

14:45.800 --> 14:47.800
I'd rather not talk about my week, thanks.

14:48.800 --> 14:50.800
Okay. Well, then we'll move on to Loki.

14:51.800 --> 14:54.800
My week was hot. That's hot.

14:55.800 --> 14:59.800
No, it's because the air conditioning is broken for a week, so that sucked.

15:00.800 --> 15:03.800
But I have a house that the dog, my mom's dog, and that sucked also.

15:03.800 --> 15:15.800
And, um, what else? Oh, just a lot of sucking. Um, basically, you know, staying at my mom's house sucked because she is on dial-up and no one likes dial-up.

15:15.800 --> 15:23.800
And also the fact that the dog, you know, wants constant attention all the time, including at three in the morning, and it's just, you know, very tiring.

15:23.800 --> 15:27.800
And then I finally get home, you know, on Friday, you know, okay, I'm done finally.

15:27.800 --> 15:32.960
you know the the apartment complexes had a week to fix the you know AC nope nope

15:32.960 --> 15:37.720
nope they're not done yet they're not gonna be done till Monday so all weekend

15:37.720 --> 15:41.200
it's been like 95 degrees in the apartment what are they having to do for

15:41.200 --> 15:45.440
your AC they replace the whole thing the whole entire unit and then they said

15:45.440 --> 15:49.520
they clogged something so they've got to do something on Jesus and I'm like oh

15:49.520 --> 15:53.520
my god fucking retarded you know what your situation is starting to sound like

15:53.520 --> 16:00.160
the plot of Dark Water whether they have a bad AC there no but it has to do with

16:00.160 --> 16:03.760
a mold spot on the seal I don't want to say too much about the plot but the

16:03.760 --> 16:07.080
trailer gives this part away so I can say that it's about this mold spot

16:07.080 --> 16:12.720
that's growing on the ceiling and the the people don't fix it the landlords

16:12.720 --> 16:16.200
and then when they finally do like it won't go away and it's still a problem

16:16.200 --> 16:19.520
and then there's this whole you know plot going on I think it's about more

16:19.520 --> 16:27.220
than a mold spot it is but that's what they try to get the scares with mold you

16:27.220 --> 16:32.980
know cuz that killer mold the black mold it's always got to be the black mold you

16:32.980 --> 16:41.060
know what they got against the black mold so yeah basically it sucked a lot

16:41.060 --> 16:49.100
and then I don't know then the rest of the week was just basically you know

16:49.100 --> 17:01.500
of work stuff, playing PSP, played more Killer7, and that type of thing. Yeah. That's it.

17:01.500 --> 17:07.100
My week and my day was okay. Nothing to scream about, really. It's been very hot here in

17:07.100 --> 17:13.900
the city, so it makes you not want to go out and do a lot. I went and saw Charlie and the

17:13.900 --> 17:18.500
Chocolate Factory for the second time. That was pretty cool, because that movie rocks.

17:18.500 --> 17:24.740
And I went to this restaurant called the Cheesecake Factory, and this is for my roommate's birthday.

17:24.740 --> 17:28.380
And this place is very, very expensive, and it's kind of known around town for having

17:28.380 --> 17:29.820
a very, very long wait.

17:29.820 --> 17:32.900
I can't remember if this place is a national chain or if it's something on the west coast.

17:32.900 --> 17:33.900
I know they have more...

17:33.900 --> 17:34.900
Is it national?

17:34.900 --> 17:37.540
Okay, then they've got one of these probably near you somewhere.

17:37.540 --> 17:38.540
I've never been before.

17:38.540 --> 17:40.020
It's brand new in this part of town.

17:40.020 --> 17:41.660
They have crappy pizza there.

17:41.660 --> 17:44.380
I have never had the pizza, but the food in general...

17:44.380 --> 17:45.860
You have the orange chicken.

17:45.860 --> 17:50.040
I actually had the orange chicken and to be honest I wasn't a fan of the orange chicken

17:50.040 --> 17:55.480
because I felt like I was paying 14 bucks for the orange chicken here and I could pay

17:55.480 --> 18:01.080
like 6 bucks over at the little Mon Pod Chinese restaurant and the orange chicken was just

18:01.080 --> 18:02.900
as good if not better.

18:02.900 --> 18:06.000
So it was one of those things where like okay well you're paying for atmosphere but the

18:06.000 --> 18:09.960
host that we had was kind of a doof.

18:09.960 --> 18:11.120
He just, I don't know.

18:11.120 --> 18:16.560
So luckily the cheesecake itself was really, really good, so at least, you know, if you're

18:16.560 --> 18:20.140
going to call your restaurant the Cheesecake Factory, you should have good cheesecake.

18:20.140 --> 18:21.140
And that they did.

18:21.140 --> 18:25.100
So I forgive them for at least having subpar as their food.

18:25.100 --> 18:30.980
But still, the bill being quite a large amount of money for three people, I just, I expected

18:30.980 --> 18:31.980
more.

18:31.980 --> 18:32.980
I don't know.

18:32.980 --> 18:34.380
I wanted, like, showgirls dancing or something.

18:34.380 --> 18:36.260
It just, I expected more.

18:36.260 --> 18:40.620
Our waitress at the San Francisco restaurant juggled ketchup packets.

18:40.620 --> 18:44.580
she earned her tip. Where was this at? The San Diego one is really the best one I've

18:44.580 --> 18:51.500
been to. It's in San Francisco. It's on the top of Macy's. It's on the thirteenth floor

18:51.500 --> 18:56.860
or something like that. Awesome. And basically you can go walk over and look at the balcony

18:56.860 --> 19:03.220
and stuff on top of the roof there. They had some stupid Christian thing going on after

19:03.220 --> 19:07.220
through the gay pride parade, so they equal everything out.

19:11.420 --> 19:13.820
In response to what DarkSakura said about the San Diego one

19:13.820 --> 19:15.900
being better, I've heard the San Francisco one is better, too.

19:15.900 --> 19:18.180
So maybe it's just our Cheesecake Factory.

19:18.180 --> 19:19.980
But our Cheesecake Factory, something's wrong.

19:19.980 --> 19:21.780
Something's clogged.

19:21.780 --> 19:23.460
They've got a mold problem or something.

19:23.460 --> 19:23.980
I don't know.

19:23.980 --> 19:26.420
But something is not right at the Cheesecake Factory

19:26.420 --> 19:29.100
here in lovely Sacramento, California.

19:29.100 --> 19:34.860
So, what do you want to talk about first? Do you want to talk about us and the news,

19:34.860 --> 19:38.200
or do you want to talk about other actual Bomani news?

19:38.200 --> 19:41.260
Us, of course. Okay, you want to talk about us? So, we were

19:41.260 --> 19:47.460
on the news this week. They came out to do a story – where were they out here? Monday?

19:47.460 --> 19:50.460
Yeah. They were out here Monday. Actually, they

19:50.460 --> 19:53.260
were out here originally on Friday – or they were supposed to be out here originally

19:53.260 --> 19:57.740
on Friday, but real news happened somewhere, so we got pushed back – we got bumped to

19:57.740 --> 20:04.460
day, but they were out here and the reporter guy was very, very nice, and the cameraman,

20:04.460 --> 20:07.700
they actually stayed quite a while. They were probably here for about an hour just filming

20:07.700 --> 20:13.700
different things. They filmed interviews with all three of us, and then they filmed us playing

20:13.700 --> 20:16.180
DDR on my new TV, which was pretty cool.

20:16.180 --> 20:21.740
Just always a bad sign. Yeah, I've got a note here that says I've got to take a picture

20:21.740 --> 20:28.340
of you guys, um, playing DDR. What does that have to do with our show? Uh, nothing. But,

20:28.340 --> 20:33.960
uh, yeah, I'm supposed to do that. Always a bad sign. You're just bitter because your

20:33.960 --> 20:40.100
feet always somehow end up in it somehow, so. Because last time, we did our research

20:40.100 --> 20:46.780
a lot. You guys played during the show, don't ya? Don't ya? Don't ya? Don't ya? No, ya idiot!

20:46.780 --> 20:52.340
We do not. We have. We did like twice. We did the Xbox Live tournament online, which

20:52.340 --> 20:58.540
nobody showed up for. Remember we were going to have our big gala 16 person DDR online

20:58.540 --> 21:02.980
tournament and then like four people showed up? I don't remember anything about that.

21:02.980 --> 21:06.980
It must have been a week you weren't here or something. Probably. It was. You remember

21:06.980 --> 21:12.220
this, right? It was an impromptu, it was when we were unveiling Ultramix 2 or something

21:12.220 --> 21:16.160
like that. That's what it was. It was one of those unveiling shows. And we tried to

21:16.160 --> 21:18.840
to get all these people to come and only four people shut up,

21:18.840 --> 21:21.040
which shows you how many people listen to this program.

21:24.520 --> 21:26.720
I mean, how many people are on Xbox Live and Lucy

21:26.720 --> 21:27.280
in the program?

21:27.280 --> 21:27.920
Whatever.

21:27.920 --> 21:28.800
And have older makes, too.

21:28.800 --> 21:29.160
I don't know.

21:29.160 --> 21:30.840
I guess not that many, but we'll see.

21:30.840 --> 21:33.300
So we tried to do that, and it failed miserably.

21:33.300 --> 21:36.200
But we have done the play DDR thing on the show before.

21:36.200 --> 21:38.520
It's just not the focus about our show.

21:38.520 --> 21:41.600
I guess, you know, and we do talk about DDR,

21:41.600 --> 21:43.160
and we talk about 2DX in the show.

21:43.160 --> 21:44.860
So I see where they get that impression.

21:44.860 --> 21:47.360
The playing DDR on the show was a little crazy.

21:47.360 --> 21:49.860
Apparently we talk about it on the podcast, too.

21:49.860 --> 21:53.360
Yeah, so then they were doing a story on the podcast,

21:53.360 --> 21:56.860
and since DDR is kind of our roots, they wanted us to show us playing DDR.

21:56.860 --> 21:57.860
So whatever, that's cool.

21:57.860 --> 22:00.360
Because that's what our podcast is about, isn't it?

22:00.360 --> 22:03.360
Because that's the impression I got from the interview,

22:03.360 --> 22:06.860
because they seem to know more about our show than we do, because...

22:06.860 --> 22:09.860
No, no, I'm not going to knock on it, because beggars can't be choosers,

22:09.860 --> 22:10.860
and it was nice.

22:10.860 --> 22:11.860
Fine, I will then.

22:11.860 --> 22:12.860
All right, fine.

22:12.860 --> 22:16.940
enough talk let's just play the damn thing is dark soccer you actually

22:16.940 --> 22:18.060
haven't seen this yet right

22:18.060 --> 22:21.140
no I was stuck singing karaoke

22:21.140 --> 22:24.700
alright so so dark soccer is gonna get to see this for the very first time so

22:24.700 --> 22:25.340
here we go

22:25.340 --> 22:29.500
I don't want anybody to see me though too late too late you were on the news

22:29.500 --> 22:35.820
too damn late I needed to ask to be pixelated and have them spell my name right

22:35.820 --> 22:39.820
maybe I should have been a spokesperson because that's the only way I'm gonna get on air

22:39.820 --> 22:43.180
You can't, when you see what they did to Loki,

22:43.180 --> 22:45.940
Extrofer, my roommate and I, laughed until we peed.

22:45.940 --> 22:47.580
It was so funny.

22:47.580 --> 22:48.860
All right, here we go.

22:48.860 --> 22:51.580
Fuck.

22:51.580 --> 22:54.100
Told the governor is one of the many people joining the

22:54.100 --> 22:57.780
podcasting craze that's becoming a web craze, but

22:57.780 --> 22:58.340
what is it?

22:58.340 --> 22:59.020
How does it work?

22:59.020 --> 23:02.020
KCRA Free's Brian Hickey tonight shows us how people

23:02.020 --> 23:05.260
are using podcasting to inform, entertain, and share

23:05.260 --> 23:07.180
their thoughts with the world.

23:07.180 --> 23:12.420
By the way, this report comes from a local news station, Channel 3, and the reporter

23:12.420 --> 23:13.420
was very nice.

23:13.420 --> 23:14.420
He was a very nice man.

23:14.420 --> 23:15.420
I liked him.

23:15.420 --> 23:16.420
He was good.

23:16.420 --> 23:20.020
And he had done his research because I was very impressed with what he did know about

23:20.020 --> 23:21.820
the station before he came here.

23:21.820 --> 23:25.180
Of course, I know he'd been talking to you quite a bit, so you probably filled him in

23:25.180 --> 23:26.180
on all that.

23:26.180 --> 23:27.180
Of course!

23:27.180 --> 23:30.980
When they headed off to the editors, all hell breaks loose.

23:30.980 --> 23:35.820
Hold on, hold on.

23:35.820 --> 23:37.820
There's Jamie playing DDR.

23:37.820 --> 23:47.820
It started off tiny and it's grown.

23:47.820 --> 23:53.820
It started off tiny and it's grown.

23:53.820 --> 23:58.820
If I didn't know you were talking about a podcast there, I could sell my clips to Blackmail.

23:58.820 --> 24:03.820
I already used a little bit of attention.

24:03.820 --> 24:05.620
And there's us sitting in the room.

24:05.620 --> 24:09.220
I would like to point out that they may not realize it, but look what they're showing

24:09.220 --> 24:10.220
in the background.

24:10.220 --> 24:11.760
Did they blur that out?

24:11.760 --> 24:12.760
I can't tell.

24:12.760 --> 24:14.900
But they're too far away.

24:14.900 --> 24:17.940
There's the Jay and Silent Bob poster, which hangs here in the studio.

24:17.940 --> 24:19.660
We have a Jay and Silent Bob poster.

24:19.660 --> 24:22.300
And I quote, all you motherfuckers are going to pay.

24:22.300 --> 24:23.900
You are the ones who are the ball lickers.

24:23.900 --> 24:27.460
We're going to fuck your mothers while you watch and cry like little whiny bitches.

24:27.460 --> 24:30.500
Once we get to Hollywood and find those Miramax fucks who's making the movie, we're going

24:30.500 --> 24:34.280
to make them eat our shit, then shit out our shit, then eat their shit, which is made up

24:34.280 --> 24:38.800
of our shit that we made them eat. And then all you motherfuckers are next. Love James

24:38.800 --> 24:43.640
Obama. You can actually see that poster in the background a little bit.

24:43.640 --> 24:46.680
Emily digressed a bit. Let's go ahead and keep going.

24:46.680 --> 24:48.640
Sorry. I don't look hideous.

24:48.640 --> 24:53.020
Look, if we could get the word fuck on the news in any way, shape, or form, I think that's

24:53.020 --> 24:56.000
worth a comment. We've done our job.

24:56.000 --> 24:57.000
All right, here we go, moving on.

24:57.000 --> 25:00.680
We should report ourselves to the MPAA or whatever.

25:00.680 --> 25:01.680
Let me roll it back a little.

25:01.680 --> 25:03.240
Yeah, we're going to have to re-rate our show adults only.

25:03.240 --> 25:04.240
Hold on.

25:04.240 --> 25:09.200
A subculture of pop culture, and these are the voices to unite and inform the gaming

25:09.200 --> 25:10.200
fans.

25:10.200 --> 25:11.200
And, where am I?

25:11.200 --> 25:12.200
Dark Sakura, Sky, and Low.

25:12.200 --> 25:13.200
Okay, stop, stop.

25:13.200 --> 25:14.200
I would like to note, where am I?

25:14.200 --> 25:15.200
Oh, they're on my feet!

25:15.200 --> 25:16.200
But where am I?

25:16.200 --> 25:17.200
Oh, that's right.

25:17.200 --> 25:18.200
They cut me behind the goddamn door.

25:18.200 --> 25:19.200
Fucking stupid.

25:19.200 --> 25:24.200
Oh, they're on my feet! But where am I? Oh, that's right, they cut me behind the goddamn door!

25:24.200 --> 25:31.200
Fucking stupid people! I can't shoot film for crap! Hello? I mean, they can say, okay, if the guy says,

25:31.200 --> 25:37.200
Hey, I can't see you, move your ass out into the fucking light so we can get a picture of you because you're behind the door!

25:37.200 --> 25:43.200
Let me- Okay, since this is a video that we're playing on the radio right now, let me set this up for the people who are listening right now, why Loki is so angry.

25:43.200 --> 25:47.300
angry. They're showing a shot of all three of us doing the show, and you can clearly

25:47.300 --> 25:49.980
see Dark Sakura in the big comfy green chair.

25:49.980 --> 25:51.500
I'm not supposed to be seen.

25:51.500 --> 25:55.980
And you can see me doing the chatting. And then you see Loki's feet dangling and his

25:55.980 --> 25:59.060
belly kind of hanging out from behind the corner.

25:59.060 --> 26:02.260
I look so short. My feet don't touch the ground.

26:02.260 --> 26:05.860
And when they say, when they say, you're right, your feet are dangling.

26:05.860 --> 26:07.260
Look! Look at my feet!

26:07.260 --> 26:09.540
You look like you're sitting in Santa's lap.

26:09.540 --> 26:12.060
Uh, no.

26:12.060 --> 26:16.900
when they go, these are the faces of Orange Lounge Radio. They show Jamie, they show me,

26:16.900 --> 26:24.220
and then they cut to another picture. Yeah, because I have a face for radio, apparently.

26:24.220 --> 26:27.440
And those of you guys that are complaining that you can't see this, you will eventually.

26:27.440 --> 26:32.100
We're working on, it's just a bandwidth thing right now, but we're going to get it uploaded

26:32.100 --> 26:36.540
sometime tonight, so you guys will have it by tomorrow. But anyone, here we go. Let me

26:36.540 --> 26:49.500
Let me finish the story here.

26:49.500 --> 26:51.780
And apparently we all live in the same apartment.

26:51.780 --> 26:52.780
By the way.

26:52.780 --> 26:53.780
I look horrible.

26:53.780 --> 26:54.780
I look horrible.

26:54.780 --> 26:55.780
Get!

26:55.780 --> 26:56.780
I have you freeze-framed right now.

26:56.780 --> 26:57.780
I look like I'm about to puke.

26:57.780 --> 27:01.420
The way you see my picture is even better.

27:01.420 --> 27:02.420
Hold on, hold on.

27:02.420 --> 27:05.420
Let me roll this back slightly so we can hear what Jamie has to say about podcasting.

27:05.420 --> 27:14.420
We basically give the news for video games, popular culture, basically what gamers really want to know.

27:14.420 --> 27:17.420
Okay, so they spelled Jamie's name right on the text over at least.

27:17.420 --> 27:20.420
They didn't spell it right online, but they spelled it right on the text over.

27:20.420 --> 27:26.420
Podcast producers record their programs, then send them to a number of websites now hosting the shows.

27:26.420 --> 27:29.420
Now anyone can create, edit, and...

27:29.420 --> 27:31.420
Ooh, pavement shot at me.

27:31.420 --> 27:33.420
Yeah, but no pictures of me.

27:33.420 --> 27:38.420
Lots of pictures of Rob, lots of pictures of Jamie, but no matter.

27:38.420 --> 27:43.420
Hold on, I didn't hear what Jamie said there. I gotta roll it back.

27:43.420 --> 27:48.480
to download it. It's something they can take with them. It's a much more flexible way of

27:48.480 --> 27:53.160
spreading the information. With nothing more than an MP3 player and a set of headphones,

27:53.160 --> 27:57.960
you can listen to it anywhere. Now people can talk about things they'd like to talk

27:57.960 --> 28:04.480
about. Yeah, who's this random guy? Now they're interviewing random guy on the skateboard.

28:04.480 --> 28:08.720
Like some dude they found. Where's the name? Casey Ryle. Yeah, some dude. If you listen

28:08.720 --> 28:13.120
to our show, email us. Look, if Casey listens to the show, the more power to him, I'm glad

28:13.120 --> 28:17.480
one of our listeners got to be a media whore. But I'd also like to point out, Casey only

28:17.480 --> 28:22.480
owns an iPod shuffle, so he's not even that hardcore. Anyway.

28:22.480 --> 28:30.120
People can join in and listen to, and it's really open, and lots of people can get into

28:30.120 --> 28:33.640
it. A number of websites are now hosting... Again, if I didn't know he was talking about

28:33.640 --> 28:39.800
podcasting, I'd find that pretty amusing. What grade am I in?

28:39.800 --> 28:41.960
And now the reporter that... Keep playing.

28:41.960 --> 28:59.760
Let me get the reporter here.

28:59.760 --> 29:04.960
I would like to point out that that is the only time in the entire news clip that our

29:04.960 --> 29:10.120
actual show name is put somewhere, because they never say Orange Lounge Radio.

29:10.120 --> 29:13.760
when they're showing how to get to the podcast and stuff, that's when they bring up the Orange

29:13.760 --> 29:17.940
Lounge Radio. It's like they show the person searching for Orange Lounge Radio and it comes

29:17.940 --> 29:24.060
up in our little Intrigue. Oh, well, you know, that's nice. Good for them. I'm glad they

29:24.060 --> 29:27.720
plugged the show, you know. Like, you know, maybe the SACB did. You know, at least they

29:27.720 --> 29:34.720
put our damn URL in there. Extrovert, do you still think the reporter was cute? I did think

29:34.720 --> 29:38.720
I think the reporter was cute, actually. I still hold to that.

29:38.720 --> 29:42.720
Anyway...

29:42.720 --> 29:46.720
...available podcasts are at your fingertips.

29:46.720 --> 29:50.720
Free for you, free for the producers, free speech for everyone.

29:50.720 --> 29:54.720
Oh, it's so much fun. It's great that, you know, just...

29:54.720 --> 29:58.720
I like a piece of podcast!

29:58.720 --> 30:02.720
Did you see? First of all, they have Loki

30:02.720 --> 30:09.120
in Dark Sakura's chair but oh it's so much fun oh god you guys I didn't even have my

30:09.120 --> 30:14.880
my god damn name on there where's my name on there oh god you guys it's so much fun

30:16.880 --> 30:24.320
that's so much fun what am i talking about oh Kelly people it's so much fun oh you know close

30:24.320 --> 30:28.800
to me that's so much fun I mean what the hell am I talking about they don't say anything it's

30:28.800 --> 30:29.800
It's just retarded.

30:29.800 --> 30:32.600
I said a whole lot more than just, oh, it's so much fun!

30:32.600 --> 30:33.600
Oh, it's so much fun!

30:33.600 --> 30:34.600
Oh, it's so much fun!

30:34.600 --> 30:35.600
Oh, look at that!

30:35.600 --> 30:39.800
I look like a goddamn chipmunk!

30:39.800 --> 30:41.800
My head looks like it has exploded!

30:41.800 --> 30:43.800
I'm super fat!

30:43.800 --> 30:45.800
Look at me!

30:45.800 --> 30:48.800
You're in so much fun, Peter!

30:48.800 --> 30:51.560
Did you think that maybe you are super fat?

30:51.560 --> 30:53.360
No, I am not.

30:53.360 --> 30:57.800
I was just having a momentary mental image of Krim.

30:57.800 --> 31:01.880
Maybe I should be going, whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.

31:01.880 --> 31:03.560
It was a night out.

31:03.560 --> 31:09.200
Wait, let me see, let me see.

31:09.200 --> 31:17.360
Let me see if I can, wait, let me see if I can, let me see if I can, let me see if I

31:17.360 --> 31:18.920
can queue this up and do this rock your style.

31:18.920 --> 31:20.440
That should be in the next intro.

31:20.440 --> 31:21.440
Hold on.

31:21.440 --> 31:22.440
Okay.

31:22.440 --> 31:24.960
Hey, Loki, what do you think about gay sex?

31:24.960 --> 31:26.960
Ugh, it's so much fun.

31:36.960 --> 31:40.960
Don't worry, this will be continued later and effused. I have not forgot about them.

31:42.960 --> 31:44.960
Let's let this finish up here.

31:44.960 --> 31:45.960
Speech for everyone.

31:45.960 --> 31:47.960
Ugh, it's so much fun.

31:47.960 --> 31:51.960
It's great that, you know, just anybody out there who really has a desire to want to be heard,

31:51.960 --> 31:55.480
you have an outlet for your voice to get out there chemically the less people

31:55.480 --> 31:56.360
want this

31:56.360 --> 31:58.100
in retro cordova brian hickey

31:58.100 --> 32:00.380
k c r a three reports

32:00.380 --> 32:03.480
everybody broadcasted out recently governor for senator began

32:03.480 --> 32:06.960
i don't think i don't think that i didn't want to do it

32:06.960 --> 32:09.960
it can be the fact that we have so you can listen to it

32:09.960 --> 32:16.260
i'm sure i don't believe that i have to add to that

32:16.260 --> 32:20.100
yeah i'm sure i'm sure you know i kept it very easy to listen to

32:20.100 --> 32:23.100
when you understand half the words

32:23.100 --> 32:26.680
we're going to track the budget now

32:26.680 --> 32:29.260
thank you for downloading my podcast

32:29.260 --> 32:31.860
rah rah rah rah

32:31.860 --> 32:34.720
it's so much fun

32:34.720 --> 32:41.240
i love my podcast it's so much fun it's tiny but it's good

32:41.240 --> 32:43.700
oh you their own ipod shuffles

32:43.700 --> 32:47.380
the ipod shuffles are the girly man's of ipods

32:47.380 --> 32:52.100
Okay, so not only did they not plug our show, not even mention who our show was, not even

32:52.100 --> 32:56.860
put me on there, gave me some really crappy line, when I had a whole lot more to say,

32:56.860 --> 33:01.420
you know, what's the, okay, so basically we're gonna ask you a lot of questions, we're gonna

33:01.420 --> 33:05.380
get you saying something really stupid, cut to you for about a second, because, you know,

33:05.380 --> 33:13.380
we have to, and then we're done. What the hell? What's up with that? It's like the pictures

33:13.380 --> 33:27.900
the podcast. Oh, we forgot one. I had a cleavage shot. It's like, gee. Eyes up, yo. Okay. Look,

33:27.900 --> 33:32.860
I'm responding to some comments in the chat room right now over at www.orangeloungeradio.com.

33:32.860 --> 33:38.020
Click on chat. Illusion says, yeah, because Orange Lounge Radio has more name recognition

33:38.020 --> 33:43.480
than Arnold Schwarzenegger. Well, someday we will. Sure. Well, we can if people don't

33:43.480 --> 33:48.540
fucking plug our show. Hello? I mean, come on. How long is it going to take? Take the

33:48.540 --> 33:54.460
extra two seconds. You can find this podcast here. Poop. Okay, put the URL up there. Done.

33:54.460 --> 33:59.860
I mean, or just say, you know, just like this show out of Sacramento, Orange Launch Radio.

33:59.860 --> 34:05.380
Just mention the name once. Once is all we're asking. Show the website. Show something.

34:05.380 --> 34:11.380
Do you think that maybe we don't get our name on TV because here we are, just letting you tear this thing apart?

34:11.380 --> 34:20.380
Fuck them! Zack B all the way! I don't give a shit if my goddamn foot was in there and that was it! At least they fucking mentioned our show! The hell with them, because they made me look like a fucking idiot!

34:20.380 --> 34:24.380
That's what I have to say about that!

34:24.380 --> 34:26.380
I

34:26.540 --> 34:33.220
Don't give a crap okay, I honestly don't give if they showed me at least looking at saying something intelligent like podcasting

34:33.220 --> 34:36.660
You know we've you know we've been doing this for six months now blah blah blah blah

34:36.660 --> 34:39.500
We have a lot of following yada yada yada, okay, or something like that, okay?

34:39.500 --> 34:43.580
That's fine, so I didn't say something really intelligent, but we love those fun

34:43.580 --> 34:49.220
I mean come on. It's it's retarded or at least just show me. Here's the face of podcast, okay?

34:49.220 --> 34:53.500
So I'm ugly or something show me really quick or something you know I mean you don't have to like

34:53.500 --> 34:58.900
Like, goddamn, I don't, I don't understand. It's just, it's annoying.

34:58.900 --> 35:01.300
So, Loki, what do you think of your anger management courses?

35:01.300 --> 35:08.900
Oh, it's so much fun. I know what this is gonna turn into. It's gonna

35:08.900 --> 35:13.900
be just like the other goddamn thing. Oh, oh, I, I shot my foot. I need to...

35:13.900 --> 35:19.900
Loki, you're purple in the face. I'm not purple in the face. I'm angry.

35:19.900 --> 35:21.900
can you see your face?

35:21.900 --> 35:23.900
You are purple!

35:23.900 --> 35:25.900
I'm not purple.

35:25.900 --> 35:27.900
Oh no, I'm violet!

35:27.900 --> 35:29.900
Damn gum.

35:29.900 --> 35:31.900
I turned into a blueberry.

35:37.900 --> 35:39.900
Oh, it's so much fun.

35:39.900 --> 35:41.900
I had to resist. Had to one more time.

35:41.900 --> 35:43.900
Alright, that won't be the last time, I'm sure.

35:43.900 --> 35:45.900
Moving on.

35:45.900 --> 35:47.900
It's gonna be cut down into a little clip

35:47.900 --> 35:51.220
clip, and then you're going to be like, hey Matt, hey Logan, what do you think about this?

35:51.220 --> 35:56.100
Oh, it's so much fun. Oh, it's so much fun. Oh, oh, oh, it's so much fun. You know what?

35:56.100 --> 36:00.020
Maybe we could compile some of this together and remix it.

36:00.020 --> 36:04.660
I have an idea. Let's send them a friendly letter commenting on how wonderful they covered

36:04.660 --> 36:11.620
our show. I'm sitting here going, you know what? No TV station give a rat's ass about

36:11.620 --> 36:12.620
us before.

36:12.620 --> 36:15.820
I look at it this way, it was about podcasting.

36:15.820 --> 36:16.320
Yeah.

36:16.320 --> 36:19.920
We were just podcasters who were convenient and had the most interesting material.

36:19.920 --> 36:22.720
We were just pawns in the big operation, really.

36:22.720 --> 36:23.220
Oh, good!

36:23.220 --> 36:24.720
Damn the man!

36:24.720 --> 36:27.220
I'm glad they mentioned everybody on the show.

36:27.220 --> 36:29.020
Oh, wait, no, they didn't. That's right, they didn't.

36:29.020 --> 36:29.520
Because...

36:30.920 --> 36:31.420
Whatever.

36:33.520 --> 36:34.220
Anyway.

36:34.220 --> 36:35.820
We are gonna put that up on the internet.

36:35.820 --> 36:37.120
Check our website.

36:37.120 --> 36:38.520
You guys will be able to download it soon.

36:38.520 --> 36:39.320
Also, big...

36:39.320 --> 36:40.720
God damn it, you know what they're gonna do?

36:40.720 --> 36:44.320
They're gonna play this at my work in front of goddamn 100 people, and it's gonna be like,

36:44.320 --> 36:45.320
oh, it's so much fun.

36:45.320 --> 36:51.720
And we're all gonna hear all goddamn day long next week, yay, oh, great new week!

36:51.720 --> 36:53.720
Perfect way to start it off!

36:53.720 --> 36:55.720
Thank you, KCRA3!

36:55.720 --> 36:57.720
I cannot wait!

36:57.720 --> 36:58.720
Are you done?

36:58.720 --> 36:59.720
Yeah, I'm done yet.

36:59.720 --> 37:00.720
Thank you.

37:00.720 --> 37:02.720
I have actually news that happened to me this week.

37:02.720 --> 37:03.720
Oh, what's that?

37:03.720 --> 37:07.720
Now that I'm no longer bitter, actually I'm gonna be addressing most of it during the

37:07.720 --> 37:09.720
FUs of the week, my work.

37:09.720 --> 37:12.720
My package arrived. My prize.

37:12.720 --> 37:16.720
Your package? Did it start off small and get a little bit bigger?

37:18.720 --> 37:20.720
Okay, no seriously, what is it?

37:20.720 --> 37:21.720
My Garuda stuff.

37:21.720 --> 37:23.720
Oh, that's right. You were a winner on some site.

37:23.720 --> 37:28.720
I am a winner. I won shit, but that wasn't really shit. It was really cool.

37:28.720 --> 37:30.720
What kind of stuff did you win?

37:30.720 --> 37:32.720
Well, this is from Filter magazine.

37:32.720 --> 37:38.720
And first of all, it was going to be just a CD and the autographed magazine.

37:38.720 --> 37:41.760
I had misunderstood the first email of the prize.

37:41.760 --> 37:46.760
But since I already had the CD, and since I actually,

37:46.760 --> 37:48.840
you know, when I was talking, I had to actually call

37:48.840 --> 37:50.120
the lady to give her my change of address

37:50.120 --> 37:52.720
because she didn't get my return email.

37:52.720 --> 37:54.280
And we were just talking about stuff and, you know,

37:54.280 --> 37:58.680
I said that I actually moderated on Gorillaz unofficial,

37:58.680 --> 38:01.440
which is a really cool site for anyone interested.

38:02.680 --> 38:04.580
But, what?

38:04.580 --> 38:16.140
You can either pay attention to me or piss off, okay?

38:16.140 --> 38:17.140
Alright.

38:17.140 --> 38:26.260
Anyway, as I was saying, because, because, you know, I wasn't just some random person

38:26.260 --> 38:33.780
filling out the little prize thingy, I actually got a mobile that I haven't seen anywhere

38:33.780 --> 38:39.540
else except a couple of years that I saw on eBay but that's like it and I got the

38:39.540 --> 38:44.940
autographs magazine and I got the sticker sheet and the little promo book

38:44.940 --> 38:50.940
that's like cool promo book so how much would you say all this is worth on eBay

38:50.940 --> 38:57.180
yeah I've seen the promo book go for a lot of money cool so so what are you

38:57.180 --> 38:59.260
gonna do it are you gonna put it on display in your house somewhere you're

38:59.260 --> 39:02.100
gonna keep it locked away in a little box to take out on days when you need

39:02.100 --> 39:08.580
some gorillas. I don't know. What do people do with these things? I don't know. I've never

39:08.580 --> 39:11.960
won anything like that before, really. Well, Dan and I have actually been off looking at

39:11.960 --> 39:20.180
office furniture. And so once we get the office set up, it's gonna go in my area. Of our office.

39:20.180 --> 39:23.720
The most excit- okay, now that's- see, there you go. The most exciting music-related thing

39:23.720 --> 39:27.980
I ever won was when I got to meet Matchbox20, who, you know, I wasn't even like that big

39:27.980 --> 39:31.080
a fan of him, but you know, I just won tickets off the radio and backstage passes, so we

39:31.080 --> 39:34.840
I get to go meet Matchbox 20, and so I just have my little autograph hanging on the wall,

39:34.840 --> 39:35.840
but that's about, you know.

39:35.840 --> 39:40.800
I'm not really an autograph collector, you know, but this is just really cool.

39:40.800 --> 39:46.360
I'm not much of an autograph collector either, however, I got Rob Thomas to sign my thing

39:46.360 --> 39:51.080
and it says, to Rob, I think you're cute, and that's worth saving.

39:51.080 --> 39:54.000
That's fun.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.960
There's a whole story behind that, but I don't like the story.

39:56.960 --> 40:01.040
When we get the scanner hooked up, I'm going to scan the magazine because I love how DJ

40:01.040 --> 40:06.060
Danger Mouse signs it. He signs a DM with a circle around it, sort of like the old Danger

40:06.060 --> 40:13.640
Mouse logo. I thought that was pretty cool. I had major happy nerd moment right then and

40:13.640 --> 40:19.080
they're just staring at it for about five minutes going, ooh, Navy Seals. Oh, wrong

40:19.080 --> 40:25.200
movie. Going back to it. Oh, since now we've had Jamie time, let's take a minute and have

40:25.200 --> 40:26.200
some Loki time.

40:26.200 --> 40:27.200
God.

40:27.200 --> 40:28.200
God.

40:28.200 --> 40:29.200
Damn.

40:29.200 --> 40:30.200
Ow!

40:30.200 --> 40:31.200
My foot!

40:31.200 --> 40:32.200
Why did I shoot myself in my face?

40:32.200 --> 40:33.200
Oh my God, it hurts so bad.

40:33.200 --> 40:34.200
No!

40:34.200 --> 40:35.200
My foot!

40:35.200 --> 40:42.600
I need that for walking.

40:42.600 --> 40:45.840
It's only funny if you were there for that episode.

40:45.840 --> 40:48.600
Somebody in the chatroom asked if I still had that sound clip, so I just had to play

40:48.600 --> 40:50.040
it for them.

40:50.040 --> 40:52.360
We need to have some Loki singing during the break.

40:52.360 --> 40:53.360
We also...

40:53.360 --> 40:56.360
I think I actually deleted those MP3s finally.

40:56.360 --> 40:57.360
No!

40:57.360 --> 40:58.360
I thought it was somewhere.

40:58.360 --> 40:59.360
I don't know.

40:59.360 --> 41:00.360
They are safe, am I?

41:00.360 --> 41:01.360
No!

41:01.360 --> 41:03.880
Soccerina has a comment here in our chat room.

41:03.880 --> 41:08.880
It has a suggestion for DarkSakura's next advice column on your show.

41:08.880 --> 41:12.760
Yes, the advice column's theme would be how to piss off Loki.

41:12.760 --> 41:13.880
And here we go.

41:13.880 --> 41:16.840
Number one, get his foot on TV.

41:16.840 --> 41:20.000
Number two, oh my god, it's so much fun.

41:20.000 --> 41:23.340
Number three, talk about how in the groove is awesome.

41:23.340 --> 41:26.180
Number four, say you'll buy him a Mac.

41:26.180 --> 41:30.220
And the final piece of advice, just stay away.

41:30.220 --> 41:31.820
That would piss him off?

41:31.820 --> 41:32.820
I don't know.

41:32.820 --> 41:36.500
Well, you know how usually your final piece of advice is, you know, just don't, like when

41:36.500 --> 41:39.620
you're doing that, how to, you know, fly out of a cannon, your final piece of advice is

41:39.620 --> 41:41.240
don't get in the fucking cannon.

41:41.240 --> 41:46.220
I was thinking that my advice was going to be on how to safely inflate your ego without

41:46.220 --> 41:48.460
it exploding into brain bits all over your company.

41:48.460 --> 41:49.460
Well, that'll work.

41:49.460 --> 41:51.700
I've been having lots of practice with that.

41:51.700 --> 41:56.700
I have an advice, Collin. It's how to shoot an interview.

41:56.700 --> 41:58.700
Because apparently, no.

41:58.700 --> 42:07.700
You know, I was watching the other segments that they cut to before ours, so meaning these were more important.

42:07.700 --> 42:09.700
That would be that it's hot.

42:09.700 --> 42:11.700
The same story they covered all week!

42:11.700 --> 42:15.700
Oh, guess what? It's still hot! In case you didn't figure that out by walking outside.

42:15.700 --> 42:19.620
wanted to headline the news. Let's get Joe Hot Person on the street and see what he thinks.

42:19.620 --> 42:25.620
It's hot out here. Come on. You know what? You know what? When I want to know exactly

42:26.260 --> 42:29.860
how hot it is, I go to the Weather Channel's website and put in my damn zip code.

42:30.820 --> 42:36.580
And then I know it's hot. Loki, if you want to be headline news, kill someone. Then you'll

42:36.580 --> 42:41.300
headline the news. Yeah, thank God. It'll be close to us. We caught a killer today.

42:41.300 --> 42:48.180
This girl's the host of Orange Lounge Radio, goes postal and kills 50 nuns because his

42:48.180 --> 42:51.020
foot was the only thing on the TV.

42:51.020 --> 42:52.020
Comment!

42:52.020 --> 42:54.020
Knock it off!

42:54.020 --> 42:58.340
I'm so quoted saying it's so much fun.

42:58.340 --> 42:59.340
Yes.

42:59.340 --> 43:02.380
I should be a reporter.

43:02.380 --> 43:10.820
It looks like it's another crazy killer who is inspired by the Grand Theft Auto San Andreas

43:10.820 --> 43:15.080
games when asked about how much he enjoys Grand Theft Auto San Andreas the

43:15.080 --> 43:23.840
killer replied it's so much fun guess what we have Grand Theft Auto San

43:23.840 --> 43:29.720
Andreas you know oh the M or the GameStop is no longer allowed to take them in

43:29.720 --> 43:33.980
as trade-ins oh really yes because they're not going to be selling anymore

43:33.980 --> 43:36.800
but I don't understand why this is now everybody's saying this is going to be

43:36.800 --> 43:39.680
such a collector's item because the thing is only like one of the top

43:39.680 --> 43:44.520
selling games of all time on three platforms. It's not like... Why did they stop selling

43:44.520 --> 43:49.720
it anyways? It's like, now it's like, oh no, oh no, damn, now those seventeen year olds

43:49.720 --> 43:54.720
are not going to be ready for the sex. But the violence! Murder! Decapitation! Oh, that's

43:54.720 --> 43:59.080
okay. Or what, now what about, what about like, you know, cause, now the game's worse

43:59.080 --> 44:04.000
now because little kids might see nudity instead of, oh, I don't know, murdering. So kids might

44:04.000 --> 44:07.120
go out, oh my god, kids are going to go out and get pregnant because they saw it in Grand

44:07.120 --> 44:13.120
What I don't understand is that little kids are only going to see the nudity if they put in the little codes that enable it.

44:13.120 --> 44:19.120
This is basically, I was going to save this for the podcast, but now you've got me on this subject, so I want to talk about this.

44:19.120 --> 44:29.120
Okay, we've seen this happen before, with DDR even, right? Remember how when you put in the DDR USA, remember the very first release of DDR USA on the PlayStation?

44:29.120 --> 44:33.000
As poopy of a game as it was, it was what got DDR in the door

44:33.000 --> 44:34.720
on PlayStation here in the US.

44:34.720 --> 44:37.240
Remember that people put in that disk and they hacked it?

44:37.240 --> 44:39.020
And what did they find on the disk?

44:39.020 --> 44:41.820
They found the background for Butterfly, and they found the

44:41.820 --> 44:45.240
background for Bad Girls, but with the gun taken out.

44:45.240 --> 44:49.440
So this obviously was, at one point or another, those songs

44:49.440 --> 44:51.820
were meant to be, even if not Butterfly, if they were just

44:51.820 --> 44:53.400
lazy from the best hits conversion

44:53.400 --> 44:54.280
and left that in there.

44:54.280 --> 44:56.880
Somebody altered the Bad Girls background.

44:56.880 --> 45:00.640
That song was intended to be in DDR USA at one point or another.

45:00.640 --> 45:05.720
But instead of what they did, instead of removing the song,

45:05.720 --> 45:09.200
removing the background, removing everything from the code completely,

45:09.200 --> 45:11.480
all they did was they took the pointer out.

45:11.480 --> 45:14.120
The thing that points to bad girls as being a song in the game,

45:14.120 --> 45:15.000
they took that out.

45:15.000 --> 45:18.120
I think that's exactly what they did with Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.

45:18.120 --> 45:22.920
I think that this sex thing was intended to be in the game the whole time.

45:22.920 --> 45:26.160
But during some final QA review process or something,

45:26.160 --> 45:27.660
they decided, you know what?

45:27.660 --> 45:29.260
If we have the sex thing in the game,

45:29.260 --> 45:30.900
I think that's crossing the line.

45:30.900 --> 45:32.740
So instead of going through the efforts

45:32.740 --> 45:34.500
to take it out of the programming, which

45:34.500 --> 45:37.960
would be a pain in the ass, they simply took the pointer out.

45:37.960 --> 45:40.340
And so they thought, well, if we just take the pointer out,

45:40.340 --> 45:42.700
you take everything that points to the sex thing out,

45:42.700 --> 45:43.980
nobody's going to find the sex thing,

45:43.980 --> 45:45.380
because all the pointers are out.

45:45.380 --> 45:48.620
Whoops, did they underestimate the PC hat community out there.

45:48.620 --> 45:50.740
Once the PC hat community found it,

45:50.740 --> 45:54.380
It was just a matter of time before somebody got the codes to basically what they're doing

45:54.380 --> 45:58.220
is putting a pointer in that points back to the sex game.

45:58.220 --> 46:02.820
And now it's this whole big thing of oh, Rockstar Games knew it all along that they were going

46:02.820 --> 46:03.820
to have the sex game.

46:03.820 --> 46:07.680
Well, yeah, they knew they had a sex game in there, but they thought they took it out.

46:07.680 --> 46:10.660
It's lazy programming is what happened here, I think.

46:10.660 --> 46:13.940
It's still retarded, though, that people are coming after this game.

46:13.940 --> 46:17.140
But anyways, we'll see if there are podcasts.

46:17.140 --> 46:19.740
Well now you got me started on that.

46:19.740 --> 46:22.780
Let's talk about how In The Groove sucks.

46:22.780 --> 46:23.780
You know, I'm gonna...

46:23.780 --> 46:25.020
We do that every show!

46:25.020 --> 46:27.740
I know, and I'm not even, I don't even think In The Groove sucks as much as you do.

46:27.740 --> 46:32.540
I didn't quite have the budget to buy In The Groove today, I thought about doing it just

46:32.540 --> 46:37.380
so I could play it once and say it sucks and then write it sucks ass on the front cover

46:37.380 --> 46:40.460
and then, you know, give it away.

46:40.460 --> 46:43.500
But um, yeah.

46:43.500 --> 46:47.380
I actually plan on playing In The Groove 2, uh, two weeks from now.

46:47.380 --> 46:51.060
i'll be playing in the group to because i'm doing my east coast trip and i'm

46:51.060 --> 46:53.900
gonna go buy it on the break one out there and i'm gonna check out

46:53.900 --> 46:57.180
in group two so i can come back and give a review on the show

46:57.180 --> 47:00.180
and i can tell loki that it's probably not as bad as he thinks it is

47:00.180 --> 47:03.460
that's me off something i have it on the new hc t t

47:03.460 --> 47:04.900
so it's going to be you know

47:04.900 --> 47:08.660
really chris finn higher-quality looking graphic that

47:08.660 --> 47:10.260
itself

47:10.260 --> 47:12.220
they're just getting a bigger t t

47:12.220 --> 47:18.680
well crap blown up

47:18.680 --> 47:21.840
just like being all the speakers in the world will not make those in

47:21.840 --> 47:27.140
you know songs any better

47:27.140 --> 47:28.940
uh... what do you do

47:28.940 --> 47:33.740
maybe you know what i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i

47:33.740 --> 47:37.780
though one day one day you guys there's hope what you will change his mind

47:37.780 --> 47:39.460
and we'll see your will ask him

47:39.460 --> 47:46.460
lucky what did you think of in the group still uh... it's so much fun

47:50.160 --> 47:53.040
really change the topic of something out of the galette

47:53.040 --> 47:56.800
you know i'd like that idea okay let's change the topic to break

47:56.800 --> 47:58.120
sorority afraid

47:58.120 --> 48:01.200
or come back from break we're to talk about our buddy media

48:01.200 --> 48:02.360
because we'd like media

48:02.360 --> 48:05.760
maybe that is something you you won't yell about right

48:05.760 --> 48:06.360
moon

48:06.360 --> 48:09.160
not a negative way

48:09.160 --> 48:11.360
All right, so we're going to talk about Midihead.

48:11.360 --> 48:14.440
In this break, we're going to do some Bamani potpourri.

48:14.440 --> 48:17.400
We'll start it off with the song from Papa Music.

48:17.400 --> 48:20.120
And we'll be back after this with more Orange Launch Radio.

48:20.120 --> 48:23.400
Your call's on the Skype line also in this very next break.

48:23.400 --> 48:26.280
So we'll be back after some Murmur twins kicking it off.

48:26.280 --> 48:52.800
🎵

48:52.800 --> 49:08.440
You don't have to believe in a heart of a doubt

49:08.440 --> 49:12.280
But it's not funny how you think you wanted to lose

49:12.280 --> 49:16.280
All you have got is getting out of bed

49:16.280 --> 49:19.280
If you wanted to lose in a heart of a doubt

49:19.280 --> 49:22.280
I want to be a part of you, I want to be

49:22.280 --> 49:26.280
A part of you is going to want to stay tonight

49:26.280 --> 49:28.280
I just can't see the way it's done

49:28.280 --> 49:31.280
So I don't mind that I made a start

49:31.280 --> 49:34.280
To you, but I don't want to stop

49:34.280 --> 49:40.280
You won't stay, you won't stop

49:40.280 --> 49:42.280
I know you can't find me

49:42.280 --> 49:45.280
I just don't know anything

50:15.280 --> 50:17.280
Oh

53:45.280 --> 53:55.280
I can't lie, I'm a killer, I understand, I can't lie

53:55.280 --> 54:05.280
I can't lie, I'm a killer, I understand, I can't lie

54:35.280 --> 54:40.280
I can't be good again, alright

54:40.280 --> 54:42.280
I can't be good again, alright

54:42.280 --> 54:46.280
You're not the king of the world,

54:46.280 --> 54:49.280
You are the voice of the world

54:49.280 --> 54:52.280
You've got to go stronger than you

54:52.280 --> 54:55.280
Oh God, oh God, oh God

54:55.280 --> 54:57.280
I kept an eye on the trail

54:57.280 --> 55:01.280
To try and save the sky

55:01.280 --> 55:03.280
I kept an eye on the trail

55:03.280 --> 55:07.280
I am a very picky guy

55:07.280 --> 55:14.280
I am a very picky guy

55:14.280 --> 55:44.120
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because Real Radio makes Captain Jack cry.

55:44.120 --> 55:48.240
And we're back with Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 151.

55:48.240 --> 55:50.680
And you can say that number forwards or backwards.

55:50.680 --> 55:51.760
The story's the same.

55:51.760 --> 55:53.520
Just thought you'd want to know.

55:53.520 --> 55:56.580
So we're talking about old-ass show jokes in the chat room

55:56.580 --> 55:58.360
right now over at orangeloungeradio.com.

55:58.360 --> 55:59.360
Click on Chat.

55:59.360 --> 56:01.800
And I was thinking about, remember when we reviewed

56:01.800 --> 56:03.760
a Dance Dance Fuck on air?

56:03.760 --> 56:06.480
Ha ha ha.

56:06.480 --> 56:06.980
Good times.

56:06.980 --> 56:07.720
The old days.

56:07.720 --> 56:11.320
That was the porno that was inspired by Dance Dance Revolution somehow.

56:11.320 --> 56:13.120
When I say inspired by?

56:13.120 --> 56:14.320
very loosely.

56:14.320 --> 56:16.320
The me... yeah, like most of the girls in it.

56:16.320 --> 56:20.120
Um, like I don't even think there was a part other than the title.

56:20.120 --> 56:20.920
But they dance.

56:20.920 --> 56:24.920
It was like Dance Dance Fuck Max... something... six or...

56:24.920 --> 56:29.220
Yeah, it was like Dance Dance... it was Dance Dance Fuck six... or something.

56:29.220 --> 56:29.920
Max.

56:29.920 --> 56:31.920
I don't know. Dance Dance Fuck Max. I don't remember what it was.

56:31.920 --> 56:34.420
That was years old, though. Years old.

56:34.420 --> 56:38.720
I always thought the porno that had the, um, Final Fantasy X...

56:38.720 --> 56:40.320
what was it, Final Fuck X?

56:40.320 --> 56:41.520
Final Fuck X.

56:41.520 --> 56:45.040
that was the better one because they had good cosplay

56:45.040 --> 56:48.680
yeah they had some good cosplayers in them and then they got naked and had sex

56:48.680 --> 56:49.760
but the Lulu

56:49.760 --> 56:53.640
actually had a little stuffed muggle

56:53.640 --> 56:57.680
anyway sorry kids

56:57.680 --> 57:00.800
oh yeah by the way children

57:00.800 --> 57:04.240
don't listen to this program it's bad bad for you you know I'm scared that I might have

57:04.240 --> 57:05.520
co-workers listening to this

57:05.520 --> 57:09.400
because they all found out about the news thing that happened last Friday

57:09.400 --> 57:14.600
and some are asking, what's the web address? I'm like, oh crap. I don't care anymore. I

57:14.600 --> 57:21.600
don't. Honestly, I don't. It's just, it's not worth it. It's not worth it. Dark Starkey,

57:21.600 --> 57:25.800
you keep it under wraps pretty good, which your weekend hobby is at work. Well, no. I

57:25.800 --> 57:29.440
tell everyone, hey, I'm on the radio. Really? Hey, listen to this. Hey, look at this, because

57:29.440 --> 57:32.160
I don't really care. You're not worried about them hearing you talk about dance, dance,

57:32.160 --> 57:32.660
fuck

57:32.660 --> 57:34.760
and all that

57:34.760 --> 57:36.500
they seem like cubicle

57:36.500 --> 57:38.920
they know you're into porn

57:38.920 --> 57:42.280
no i am not into porn okay

57:42.280 --> 57:43.860
that was loki's

57:43.860 --> 57:44.640
piece of

57:44.640 --> 57:46.840
crap

57:46.840 --> 57:50.580
hey i was looking for quality dance dance revolution products that came

57:50.580 --> 57:53.900
upon that was like quality

57:53.900 --> 57:56.200
i was like i have to get back to my cubicle

57:56.200 --> 57:59.860
i have the happy bunny magnet that you gave me in my cubicle

57:59.860 --> 58:03.080
with Happy Bunny pointing down to his crotch, saying,

58:03.080 --> 58:04.660
I bet you love my thingy.

58:04.660 --> 58:08.920
And I'm going to be taking my other one there, too,

58:08.920 --> 58:12.940
that says, I love everybody except you assholes.

58:12.940 --> 58:13.860
I don't think I have.

58:13.860 --> 58:16.340
Don't you have a pledge for a new position?

58:16.340 --> 58:18.620
I think you mentioned it a couple of times.

58:18.620 --> 58:22.360
I like my job, but I have to, since I'm a presenter,

58:22.360 --> 58:24.060
I'm in front of people most of the time,

58:24.060 --> 58:25.540
I have to stay politically correct.

58:25.540 --> 58:27.060
It's a very interesting challenge.

58:27.060 --> 58:46.060
Some of my friends theorize that's why I do this program is because I have to be so politically correct when I'm in front of a class teaching that this is my way of venting the other half of that, the unpolitically correct side of me, where I get to, you know, come on and say shit, piss, fuck, and people listen to that and laugh at it. I don't know.

58:46.060 --> 58:50.060
You mean they don't throw lawsuits our way? Why is that?

58:50.060 --> 58:52.060
Because we're on the interweb.

58:52.060 --> 58:55.060
That's right. No one likes the internet.

58:55.060 --> 59:07.060
Speaking of places you can't say shit, fuck, and cunt, there was, somebody had emailed me about this to my Orange Lounge account about, I guess, Attack of the Show, you know, the G4 program.

59:07.060 --> 59:18.060
They're gonna do, they're having problems finding a new host, so they're supposedly doing open tryouts in three cities, LA, New York, and San Francisco.

59:18.060 --> 59:21.880
I'm thinking we need to have a road trip and all three of us need to try out the new co-host

59:22.560 --> 59:25.640
Because you know Loki on Attack of the Show would be

59:26.760 --> 59:28.760
hilarious

59:28.920 --> 59:31.880
Come on this show drunk. Oh my god. I so much fun

59:34.720 --> 59:39.360
No, I'm seriously thinking about doing my only issue is though since I'm gonna be gone for two weeks

59:39.360 --> 59:42.560
I have a feeling that that's when they're gonna be here in San Francisco is when I'm gone

59:42.560 --> 59:45.720
So I'm not gonna be able to do it and they're gonna miss out on a great

59:45.720 --> 59:52.680
candidate if I'm I can't be there to do it so then there I don't know I don't

59:52.680 --> 59:55.440
they're just gonna get some big-breasted chicken doesn't know jack about

59:55.440 --> 01:00:03.960
technology done I hear cards I should lie but you know you you may have

01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:09.400
adequate boobage but you know you don't you you actually know technology you

01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:12.760
have a bigger gaming collection than the two of us combined well I have a bigger

01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:16.560
your gaming collection than five of each of you combined.

01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:20.600
Just grab one of the chicks off that stupid show the whips set or whatever you know.

01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:22.040
I'll go to the audition

01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:23.960
with my turbo express

01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:27.600
and my wonder swan. Well here's the thing I was looking at the kevinpereira.com

01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:30.400
which is the guy that's you know still the host on Attack of the Show

01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:33.800
who by the way I like more and more as I see the show more and more. When the

01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:37.480
screensavers first came out I was kinda like okay this guy's a boob

01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:38.360
I don't like him

01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:42.000
but I'm like I'm really warming up to him and I think what they're trying to do

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:45.480
with the show, he really does kind of fit it, and he's kind of funny, and I think now

01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:51.100
that he's... yeah, he'll have to go! I think when it first started as The Screensavers,

01:00:51.100 --> 01:00:55.360
I think it was always kind of trying to fit a square peg in a round hole kind of thing,

01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:59.200
and I think he realizes this, so even if, you know, for some weird reason he heard me

01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:01.960
saying this, he wouldn't be offended because I think he realizes this, because even he

01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:08.160
says that first episode of The Screensavers was bad. And it was. But when they did this

01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:11.640
own show thing, I think he got a chance to kind of grow into the show that he really

01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:20.520
wanted to do and I think he just, his value on TV increased like 500% so he's a good guy.

01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:23.600
But on his site he was talking about kind of what they're looking for in a new host

01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:28.560
and they're not, he said, we're not looking for a pretty face but we're not looking for

01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:32.400
someone that just is about the technology. We're looking for someone that wants to be

01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:36.320
on TV talking about technology. And for some reason they're having a hard time finding

01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:38.200
that. Yes, Dark Sakura.

01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:39.200
I'm volunteering.

01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:42.840
but wait a minute though you don't want to support the webcam at you yet you

01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:44.080
would be on television

01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:47.760
I'd hire a trainer

01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:51.960
I'd do it. I could talk about technology. That's all I talk about

01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:55.320
You want to get me to lose weight? Put me in a social situation

01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:58.600
every freaking day

01:01:58.600 --> 01:02:02.880
I guarantee you I won't eat for a month

01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:06.320
I hear cabinets is what I hear

01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:09.480
I heard knocking.

01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:13.560
I could do it.

01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:16.720
Easy. Easy.

01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:20.640
It's so much fun. Is it?

01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:24.640
Is it now? You know it's tiny, but it's grown. Yeah.

01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:29.280
Rob, you abandoned us! How dare you!

01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:33.640
50 lashes with a chocolate lip.

01:02:33.640 --> 01:02:36.640
Rob, you can't go on Attack on the Show, because we need to do our show.

01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:44.640
If somebody offered me money to do a live television show, I'd be all, screw you guys, I'm going to L.A.

01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:46.640
No, I'm just kidding, I love you guys.

01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:50.640
I'd at least give you my two weeks, come on.

01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:52.640
You bastard.

01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:54.640
At that point...

01:02:55.640 --> 01:02:57.640
At that point, you have a Menchie hat!

01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:00.640
Give!

01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:02.640
From Anime Expo, you want it?

01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:03.640
Yes.

01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:05.640
I have a Menchie hat.

01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:06.640
Anyway.

01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:08.640
Let's eat her!

01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:10.640
She's emergency food supply!

01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:12.640
I have a Menchie hat.

01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:15.640
Anyway, joining us by the way, who hasn't been at this show in an awfully long time,

01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:18.640
is the one and only explicit with three X's.

01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:20.640
Our angry guy!

01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:21.640
Well, I'm actually...

01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:23.640
Trust what we need this show.

01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:26.640
Alright, I'm not going to be angry this time.

01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:27.640
I've got some more important...

01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:29.640
More important than just being angry.

01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:34.280
Now, we were talking about TV earlier, and we were talking about Attack of the Show and

01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:40.240
how we're all going to be on it soon, because we want to do that.

01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:45.960
Supposedly some folks were emailing them too about us going on, so nobody contacted us,

01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:47.760
so I guess it wasn't enough people.

01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:52.920
So go email them and tell them we're ready to whore ourselves out to be on cable.

01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:56.680
Because we figure, okay, we've done the newspaper, we've done local TV, now we have to do basic

01:03:56.680 --> 01:03:57.680
cable.

01:03:57.680 --> 01:03:58.680
That's the next step up.

01:03:58.680 --> 01:04:03.520
So far, like Captain Canada, Toady, and me got that spotlight right there.

01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:07.780
Now I was going to say, what happened, now you also had a television experience recently,

01:04:07.780 --> 01:04:11.720
we had channel 3, but you had another station in town, what was yours a thing about?

01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:21.680
It was basically like, the scenery of the DDR, and introducing the game to people, for

01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:28.320
like perfect attack and freestyle, in addition to how this one person lost this much weight

01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:33.480
on DDR. So they were kind of doing more like a DDR story and here's the dance, they were

01:04:33.480 --> 01:04:38.180
doing that typical Dance Dance Revolution in the news story where DDR, it's better than

01:04:38.180 --> 01:04:41.740
Grand Theft Auto because instead of making kids want to kill people, it makes them get

01:04:41.740 --> 01:04:48.340
up and exercise and want to lose weight. But then, now the little piece I saw of it had

01:04:48.340 --> 01:04:53.180
Andrew dressed up like a pirate. Yep, that's true. And that other guy that's always with

01:04:53.180 --> 01:04:59.720
them and dressed up as Darth Vader. A different Andrew. Yeah. And they were just, you know,

01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:05.660
being themselves, but on TV. Or in the media, I guess. Yes. I would have totally gone if

01:05:05.660 --> 01:05:11.000
I didn't have to work. Yeah. You would bring Orange Eyes radio to the TV. Yeah, so we had

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:15.720
to go get our own gig, since we couldn't go to yours. I heard about Channel 3, so...

01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:22.720
We played the clip earlier, you missed it. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, oh. Oh, Loki, I'm

01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:26.720
I'm so glad you suggested it here, um, let me, um, get to the little vase here.

01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:29.720
What'd you find? What'd you find, ArtSakura?

01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:32.720
I found the Menchi hat, cause I want one now.

01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:35.720
You want that?

01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:36.720
Alright.

01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:39.720
Yes, this is from Anime X-bomb, who's giving away some stuff from Anime X-bomb?

01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:41.720
Okay! If you don't want the Menchi hat, sure!

01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:44.720
Alright, this is just for you, Jonas.

01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:46.720
Um, Loki, what did you think about being on television?

01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:48.720
Oh, it's so much fun.

01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:49.720
It's great.

01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:51.720
That was Loki's big television debut.

01:05:51.720 --> 01:05:53.720
That was it!

01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:55.720
That was it!

01:05:57.720 --> 01:05:59.720
Oh wow.

01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:03.720
Anyway, from what I heard from the taping though

01:06:03.720 --> 01:06:05.720
Loki, you know what this is?

01:06:05.720 --> 01:06:09.720
The world's smallest violin playing My Heart Bleeds For You.

01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:14.720
Yeah, from what I've heard from the taping, the two Andrews were there

01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:18.720
and some background people doing PA

01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:24.360
And then me and, kind of doing a little freestyle, get to see, introduce it to the scenery.

01:06:24.360 --> 01:06:29.640
And I'm not really sure if Scott Farah, the gaming guy of Channel 31 came back to introduce

01:06:29.640 --> 01:06:30.640
the tournament.

01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:33.920
I didn't even know we had a gaming guy on local television.

01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:34.920
We had a gaming guy?

01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:35.920
Yeah.

01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:38.560
His name is Scott Farah on the morning show.

01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:40.080
Usually he's there on Mondays.

01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:41.240
I'm the guy.

01:06:41.240 --> 01:06:42.240
The gaming guy.

01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:43.240
Is that his job?

01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:46.080
Is that strictly his job is to be the gaming guy?

01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:47.080
Dude!

01:06:47.080 --> 01:06:51.580
I want to be the gaming guy. I'm cute. I can be on TV.

01:06:51.580 --> 01:06:54.580
You're going to be there on the tournament if you're still interested in going on the 30th.

01:06:54.580 --> 01:07:00.080
I might, except I have a flight leaving the very next day, so I'm going to try and make it.

01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:03.080
Tell us, plug your tournament, plug your tourney thing that you're doing.

01:07:03.080 --> 01:07:10.080
Well, we had one tournament, they won a tournament already yesterday for the Initial D section.

01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:11.580
Oh yeah? How'd that go?

01:07:11.580 --> 01:07:23.580
It turned out pretty okay, so-so in certain ways, because we had some problems with someone's card, didn't read it, but then again, they said the card was bent, so I don't know what happened.

01:07:23.580 --> 01:07:33.580
It was 8 competitors, the first place winner was some guy named Jay, second place was T, and third was Kenshin.

01:07:33.580 --> 01:07:38.580
Jonas, you know what you and I need to do? We need to work on Shaft 2.

01:07:38.580 --> 01:07:40.580
Oh yes.

01:07:40.580 --> 01:07:44.580
But we're gonna post it though, so far, with the plans.

01:07:44.580 --> 01:07:46.580
Yeah, but I need to, we need to talk.

01:07:46.580 --> 01:07:53.580
Cause I've been needing to get SHAP2 run for a while and they've been kinda being assholes at RVGL.

01:07:53.580 --> 01:07:56.580
Oh, that's why I don't deal with RVGL.

01:07:56.580 --> 01:07:59.580
They, their management with tournaments, no.

01:07:59.580 --> 01:08:05.580
This facility would be great, otherwise, I don't want to deal with what's-his-face.

01:08:05.580 --> 01:08:12.580
No, it's funny, because their management also put repairing their machines as no and listening to the customers as no.

01:08:12.580 --> 01:08:14.580
That's really ironic, the way that works.

01:08:14.580 --> 01:08:17.580
Wait, wait, wait. Are you serious?

01:08:17.580 --> 01:08:21.580
Okay, first of all, RBGL is a business, so...

01:08:21.580 --> 01:08:23.580
We'll talk to you in the chat room. Hold the microphone a little bit back.

01:08:23.580 --> 01:08:24.580
Okay.

01:08:24.580 --> 01:08:28.580
Which is funny, because Jonas actually doesn't hold his microphone that close to his mouth.

01:08:28.580 --> 01:08:30.580
He's just got that kind of voice, kids.

01:08:30.580 --> 01:08:31.580
But that's all right.

01:08:31.580 --> 01:08:37.580
That's alright. I mean, let's see, I don't know why RBGL doesn't want a tournament, because I've done this before myself.

01:08:37.580 --> 01:08:46.580
Well, that's where F.U. was supposed to be held. But then I decided to do P.I. because that's the only place that would host a tournament.

01:08:46.580 --> 01:08:54.580
Scandia, they want to do their own gig. Of course, you've been to one of their tournaments.

01:08:54.580 --> 01:08:57.940
I did go to one of those Scandia tournaments. It was okay. It was cute.

01:08:57.940 --> 01:08:58.440
Yeah.

01:08:58.440 --> 01:09:03.740
It wasn't like a large-scale DDR tournament. It wasn't the kind of thing you should drive in from San Francisco for, but it was cute.

01:09:03.740 --> 01:09:04.740
Yeah, I know.

01:09:04.740 --> 01:09:05.740
Yeah.

01:09:05.740 --> 01:09:10.840
And if, yeah, first off, right, Jamie, first off, take care of the, um, the tournament that's happening this Saturday.

01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:12.840
Then I'll, we'll talk about Shaft 2.

01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:15.840
No, I meant factor, because I've got to deal with school starting.

01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:16.340
Oh, yeah.

01:09:16.340 --> 01:09:18.340
Once I get in my school schedule, I'll have more time to apply to that.

01:09:18.340 --> 01:09:18.840
All right.

01:09:18.840 --> 01:09:21.840
Yeah, just give me a call at any time and reply and we'll see what's up.

01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:25.840
So many people want to help out with the whole tournament issues.

01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:34.840
And Shaft had such a good turnout and it ended up being one of the big ones when it was out that I think that putting the name on it would give us a big draw-in.

01:09:34.840 --> 01:09:35.840
I'll see what happens.

01:09:35.840 --> 01:09:38.840
We got a few people. We got a few of the Omaha people.

01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:41.840
Yeah, I remember that. That was pretty cool. It was a good time.

01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:44.840
And the 2DX tournament, too, was cool, except we won't be having that again.

01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:45.840
Wasn't that Marshall Brandis, though?

01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:46.840
We did it at Shaft.

01:09:46.840 --> 01:09:47.840
That was at Shaft.

01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:48.840
We did both. It was both.

01:09:48.840 --> 01:09:49.840
Oh, okay.

01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:58.840
Anyway, what we're going to do now, I was going to talk about the Midihead thing, so let me get into that.

01:09:58.840 --> 01:10:06.840
Midihead, our buddy that had a song over in UltraMix 2, he did, you know, the In My Eyes remix was in UltraMix 2, remember that?

01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:10.840
Pretty good song there, very well-liked fan favorite.

01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:18.400
Um, he's back, he's going to be in, um, he's going to be in UltraMix 3, and he actually

01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:22.520
is debuting his brand new tracks from UltraMix 3.

01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:25.960
We've played one of them here on the show before, we've played the song Raise Your Hands

01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:30.480
here on the show previously, but he's debuting the new Jelly Kiss remix, what is it, the

01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:33.560
Jelly Kiss Midi Head Smack Mix is what it's called?

01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:38.680
It's a brand new remix of Jelly Kiss and he's debuting it on his own podcast, and we're

01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:42.000
We're actually mirroring the podcast over on OrangeLunchRadio.com, so if you want to

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:45.920
check it out, what Midyhead did is he kind of put this whole show together.

01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:51.480
He engineered this 30-minute show where he plays his track from Ultramix 2.

01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:56.040
He played the Wraith song from his upcoming album.

01:10:56.040 --> 01:10:59.080
He played, what else did he play?

01:10:59.080 --> 01:11:00.920
He played Raise Your Hands.

01:11:00.920 --> 01:11:03.060
He played Take Me Away From Here.

01:11:03.060 --> 01:11:07.680
And then he plays the new remix from DDR Ultramix 3.

01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:12.000
the jelly kiss mini head smack mix we're gonna play a clip of this mix for you

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:15.560
guys we want you guys to actually go and download the podcast yourself to check

01:11:15.560 --> 01:11:19.360
it out we want to support MIDI head with that but we will play a little clip so

01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:26.360
So here you go, here's a clip of the midi head smack mix of Jelly Kiss.

01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:58.120
So it sounds pretty cool. It sounds like it's going to be a fun little remix there. I remember

01:11:58.120 --> 01:12:03.040
playing it at E3 and I loved the remix of Jelly Kiss, so it was probably my favorite

01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:08.020
thing. I actually tried to play it. What did you think of the song? My hip ended up being

01:12:08.020 --> 01:12:13.960
a screaming nightmare of agony. But that's not because of the song. No, I liked the song.

01:12:13.960 --> 01:12:18.280
I wish I could have played it, only got halfway through it before my hip gave out on me. So

01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:19.720
So anyway, check that out.

01:12:19.720 --> 01:12:23.440
Midyhead doing his own podcast thing.

01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:26.120
If you're too lazy to set up the podcasting thing,

01:12:26.120 --> 01:12:29.280
there's a direct link that they're hosting on DDRFreak.

01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:30.720
So check that out on ddrfreak.com.

01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:33.240
You can just download the MP3 right there, which, by the

01:12:33.240 --> 01:12:35.900
way, I think would probably be the only time I've ever seen a

01:12:35.900 --> 01:12:39.600
Bamani-related MP3 so blatantly on DDRFreak.

01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:41.660
So that's kind of a historical thing as well.

01:12:41.660 --> 01:12:43.920
So check that out.

01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:46.760
It's nice.

01:12:46.760 --> 01:12:53.760
But Montystyle isn't hosting the file per se, but they ran an article on it and so did

01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:54.760
DDRUK.

01:12:54.760 --> 01:13:00.080
And that's thanks to one of our listeners, actually, who is mod on all those sites.

01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:04.400
Anyway, check that out.

01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:06.160
It's a good time.

01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:08.360
It's a good podcast.

01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:12.880
The thing about Midihead too is he does these funny radio voiceovers during the whole thing

01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:13.880
too.

01:13:13.880 --> 01:13:14.880
He's like, this is Midihead!

01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:17.880
You're just going like crazy during the whole thing.

01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:19.880
Yeah, you got a shout-out on the thing.

01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:22.880
I didn't get a shout-out. Jamie didn't get a shout-out. You got a shout-out.

01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:24.880
Your mic's not on.

01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:26.880
Damn straight, because the mic needs me on.

01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:29.880
No, because I'm awesome.

01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:31.880
And I hang out on those forums.

01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:35.880
Yeah, you just get it because you have the shout-out because you hang out on the forums.

01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:37.880
That's what it is, basically.

01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:39.880
What it boils down to.

01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:41.880
So, Loki, what did you think of the Midihead podcast?

01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:43.880
It was so much fun.

01:13:43.880 --> 01:13:50.880
Anyway, not as much fun as this McDonald's BBQ sauce.

01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:57.880
Alright, since you guys are eating. By the way, Midihead also teases the fact that there's a third song he's going to have in the game.

01:13:57.880 --> 01:14:03.880
He pretty much all but says, I have a third song in UltraMix 3, but he's teasing us. He's not telling us what that song is.

01:14:03.880 --> 01:14:12.880
So, we're assuming that the reason why you might want to subscribe to the podcast and not just download the direct file, unless you're lazy and don't want to set up podcasting,

01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:16.880
you probably want to subscribe to the podcast because whenever this third song is

01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:17.520
announced

01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:21.760
he will probably do a podcast part 2 and that's gonna be the first place you're gonna

01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:22.720
hear this new song

01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:27.380
so he pretty much all but said he's gonna have a third song in the game so we're

01:14:27.380 --> 01:14:29.240
kinda interested to see what that is

01:14:29.240 --> 01:14:32.440
but you notice that they've kind of in general

01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:35.800
been very very quiet about these recent

01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:39.440
DDR games like they haven't been doing the clues

01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:42.680
they usually do the clues around this time where people try to guess what the

01:14:42.680 --> 01:14:44.160
songs are that are going to be in the game

01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:48.120
they haven't been saying a whole lot about the features we've really gotten

01:14:48.120 --> 01:14:51.240
not a lot since E3 besides this Midihead thing

01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:55.600
not a problem, they'll just send another demo for GamePro the review and

01:14:55.600 --> 01:14:59.680
BOOM! There you go, there's everything. Why do you think that is that they're being so

01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:04.320
tight-lipped about it this time? Because GamePro sucks? No, not GamePro, that's nothing to do with GamePro

01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:06.800
I'm talking about in general Konami's lack of

01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:10.160
playing around on the forums. I mean,

01:15:10.160 --> 01:15:14.520
some of the Konami reps are playing on DDR Freak and they chime in once in a

01:15:14.520 --> 01:15:15.000
while.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:18.440
Even Miklotov, who's been on the show a couple times, he's jumped in there, but

01:15:18.440 --> 01:15:22.000
you notice that when Miklotov has been on the show, he's been very...

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:26.480
he hasn't said, like, anything. Not nearly what he was telling us this time last year.

01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:30.480
On the show, he's not saying a whole lot about the new games.

01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:33.920
So...

01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:38.960
they're doing some weird things with this uh... the releases coming out so

01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:43.920
good things but weird things so i'm thinking they're probably just going to

01:15:43.920 --> 01:15:48.920
keep it in a wrap so when it comes out and people go oh wow you know instead of

01:15:48.920 --> 01:15:51.440
just ah it sounds like crap and then they don't buy it

01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:55.880
so it's more of a shock factor they don't really have to give hints why no other

01:15:55.880 --> 01:15:58.320
companies give hints about what their games are going to be like

01:15:58.320 --> 01:16:02.160
fuck it wait you know be patient rockstars on their forums going hey guys

01:16:02.160 --> 01:16:07.640
you know you can unlock a sex game I think you know what I think there was a

01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:11.600
e3 strategy that worked very well for them and that is that they didn't say

01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:18.600
shit about Beatmania USA until e3 itself it was a very very quiet thing they they

01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:22.960
had said oh yeah we're gonna have you know Xtreme 2 and DDR Ultramix 3 and all

01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:27.720
that stuff but they didn't say anything about they didn't say anything about

01:16:27.720 --> 01:16:32.560
about Beatmania. Because if they had said something about Beatmania, people were going

01:16:32.560 --> 01:16:36.080
to come up with all these preconceived notions about what they wanted in Beatmania. And when

01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:40.520
that wasn't met, they were going to be disappointed. I have a feeling it's a similar thing they're

01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:45.120
doing here. They're not saying anything about the games, because if they do, people are

01:16:45.120 --> 01:16:50.520
just going to go, wah wah wah, why isn't this feature in the game, and why didn't they put

01:16:50.520 --> 01:16:55.400
this song in, and wah wah wah. I think they're just trying to avoid that, because it seems

01:16:55.400 --> 01:16:58.340
that's what happens when they tell us the song list is people go although

01:16:58.340 --> 01:17:01.580
there are the people that are appreciative of the hints and that

01:17:01.580 --> 01:17:05.420
deserve to know these things in advance there's just a few bad apples that ruin

01:17:05.420 --> 01:17:08.780
it for everyone that people would get on there and go why don't we get this song

01:17:08.780 --> 01:17:13.520
and why haven't we gotten cartoon heroes and DDR yet wasn't wasn't genie in a

01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:20.900
bottle in a was a DDR extreme 2 genie a bottle or what was it they had some like

01:17:20.900 --> 01:17:27.180
Christina Aguilera song or something like that, and then they got like Britney I think

01:17:27.180 --> 01:17:35.680
in there too, but I'm actually interested to hear those again, I don't know.

01:17:35.680 --> 01:17:38.540
They weren't in the E3 thing though, it was just a preview.

01:17:38.540 --> 01:17:39.540
They had a clip.

01:17:39.540 --> 01:17:40.540
They had a thing.

01:17:40.540 --> 01:17:45.580
There was a clip of the Genie in the Bottle thing that was on some video of somebody from

01:17:45.580 --> 01:17:48.700
E3 or something, that's right, no they did have Genie in the Bottle in the E3 demo, but

01:17:48.700 --> 01:17:50.860
it was so freaking loud you couldn't hear.

01:17:50.860 --> 01:17:55.460
That's right. And I thought that they mentioned, though, something about oops, I did it again,

01:17:55.460 --> 01:18:00.380
too, being in there. I thought, because I remember after that, people, oh, long versions

01:18:00.380 --> 01:18:02.580
are coming back, and we're like, no.

01:18:02.580 --> 01:18:09.940
No, oops wasn't in there, but I think it's kind of assumed that it's going to be a different

01:18:09.940 --> 01:18:15.220
cut of oops, I did it again. So, all right. Anyway, I'm just kind of reading what's going

01:18:15.220 --> 01:18:18.780
on in the chat room, and I think some people are kind of agreeing with the same thing that,

01:18:18.780 --> 01:18:22.740
know people are basically Konami isn't wanting to deal with the obnoxious

01:18:22.740 --> 01:18:25.820
people that whine about everything they release and all that other stuff going

01:18:25.820 --> 01:18:33.540
on there. And then let's see I thought the E3 build of Beatmania was just a

01:18:33.540 --> 01:18:38.500
throw together. I think in some ways it was because some things weren't enabled

01:18:38.500 --> 01:18:42.940
in there but I think I think it's gonna be what they're going in the direction

01:18:42.940 --> 01:18:46.980
towards I think it is going to be basically a night style redone for us

01:18:46.980 --> 01:18:51.640
with different songs and the whole five key songs and five key mode which I

01:18:51.640 --> 01:18:54.500
think is pretty cool. I don't know if it was necessarily thrown together because

01:18:54.500 --> 01:18:58.700
that five key song and five key mode probably took a little... It's a beta. It's supposed to be

01:18:58.700 --> 01:19:02.540
thrown together. That's what a beta is. I think they wanted to show what they were

01:19:02.540 --> 01:19:05.820
gonna do but not, I mean, obviously they probably haven't made a lot of progress

01:19:05.820 --> 01:19:08.260
on the game because they're working on the DDRs instead. You kind of wonder what these fans are...

01:19:08.260 --> 01:19:12.460
Oh what? I expected the full game to be done. No, you idiot. They're not gonna have

01:19:12.460 --> 01:19:17.400
the full game done. It's obviously a work in progress. I mean, they're just showing

01:19:17.400 --> 01:19:23.300
off what they have. That's why they have the E3 version. I mean, people are like, oh, the

01:19:23.300 --> 01:19:32.300
full game is going to suck because it doesn't have seven key and wine. So, you know, whatever.

01:19:32.300 --> 01:19:35.740
All right. What we're going to do now, I guess we're going to go to a break. When we come

01:19:35.740 --> 01:19:39.660
back from break, we'll take your calls. Sorry, I promised that we'd do the Skype thing this

01:19:39.660 --> 01:19:42.660
break but we didn't get around to it so we'll take your calls on Skype when we

01:19:42.660 --> 01:19:47.580
come back from this next break and we will also do the cage match tonight

01:19:47.580 --> 01:19:51.340
because I keep promising we're gonna get into that as well so let's start off

01:19:51.340 --> 01:19:56.100
this break with I think we'll do some home version song here also you know

01:19:56.100 --> 01:19:58.740
what I feel like I feel like playing that one love is orange mix it's a

01:19:58.740 --> 01:20:00.980
little bit longer of a song but I think we're gonna fit it in here because I

01:20:00.980 --> 01:20:04.580
feel like playing that so we're gonna play that and we'll be back with more

01:20:04.580 --> 01:20:11.580
more Orange Lounge Radio in the cage match and your calls on the skype line after this.

01:25:04.580 --> 01:25:07.080
Hey, listen, let me tell you, let me tell you

01:25:07.080 --> 01:25:10.080
Just a question, man, can you rest a little bit, just a little?

01:25:10.080 --> 01:25:12.080
Oh

01:26:40.080 --> 01:26:44.080
a

01:26:44.080 --> 01:26:48.080
a

01:26:48.080 --> 01:26:52.080
a

01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:56.080
a

01:26:56.080 --> 01:27:00.080
a

01:27:00.080 --> 01:27:04.080
a

01:27:04.080 --> 01:27:08.080
a

01:27:08.080 --> 01:27:32.880
easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song orange lounge radio hi kids we're back

01:27:32.880 --> 01:27:37.760
with more orange lounge radio here we're gonna get in the cage match somewhat shortly but

01:27:37.760 --> 01:27:41.120
But we also wanted to start taking your calls on the

01:27:41.120 --> 01:27:41.880
Skype line.

01:27:41.880 --> 01:27:44.840
So if you want to call us, head on over to the Skype line.

01:27:44.840 --> 01:27:49.280
It's www.orangeloungeradio.com.

01:27:49.280 --> 01:27:51.280
And just click on Interact With Us, and it has all the

01:27:51.280 --> 01:27:55.440
information that you need to call us and talk live with us.

01:27:55.440 --> 01:27:59.980
And so while we have that open up, I don't see a whole lot

01:27:59.980 --> 01:28:00.800
of people sign in.

01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:01.680
Maybe we'll get a couple calls.

01:28:01.680 --> 01:28:04.280
We'll see.

01:28:04.280 --> 01:28:06.600
But meanwhile, I want to remind you guys about

01:28:06.600 --> 01:28:12.960
something, podcast awards. We were nominated in the recent podcast awards, so you should

01:28:12.960 --> 01:28:20.080
vote for us. Head on over to www.podcastawards.com and make sure that you vote for us once every

01:28:20.080 --> 01:28:25.660
day. I vote every day. Are you still voting every day? You can't forget, you got to vote

01:28:25.660 --> 01:28:29.600
every day because these guys on the other sites are pretty hardcore, so just got to

01:28:29.600 --> 01:28:33.780
make sure that we get up there. All right, now our phone line is starting to light up

01:28:33.780 --> 01:28:36.780
So here we go, we're gonna take a call. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:28:36.780 --> 01:28:41.780
Hey Skye, Siggy here. Hi Siggy! It's the 2DX bastard.

01:28:41.780 --> 01:28:43.780
Hello!

01:28:43.780 --> 01:28:48.780
Konbanwa minasan. Konbanwa ogenki desu ka?

01:28:48.780 --> 01:28:51.780
Ogenki desu.

01:28:51.780 --> 01:28:58.780
Well, just, you know, just some off-topic stuff. I got some 2DX, you know, Happy Skye.

01:28:58.780 --> 01:29:00.780
Some interesting stuff about Happy Skye.

01:29:00.780 --> 01:29:06.780
Oh, what's going on with Happy Sky? I'm going to get to those MP3s you sent me later, too. I haven't forgotten. I just want to save it for later.

01:29:06.780 --> 01:29:12.780
Well, you can play a small clip if you want. I'm just going to announce them, the hidden songs.

01:29:12.780 --> 01:29:19.780
Okay, hold on. I've got to get that rigged up, though. So how did they... So what, did a code come out that unlocked these songs, or how did this happen? How did we get the new songs?

01:29:19.780 --> 01:29:23.780
Well, they're only unlocked for e-amusement.

01:29:23.780 --> 01:29:28.780
Oh, I see. So, in other words, it's songs we will never play over here in the States.

01:29:28.780 --> 01:29:32.780
Unless they're upgraded to a new 2DX mix.

01:29:32.780 --> 01:29:35.780
Hmm. Very interesting.

01:29:35.780 --> 01:29:37.780
Um, why am I having a hard time finding...

01:29:37.780 --> 01:29:40.780
Oh! Hold on, I'm having a hard time locating those files,

01:29:40.780 --> 01:29:42.780
because for some reason I thought you sent them to me on AIM,

01:29:42.780 --> 01:29:45.780
but then I remembered you can't send me things on AIM.

01:29:45.780 --> 01:29:49.780
Well, I never have your AIM suite to be named.

01:29:49.780 --> 01:29:50.780
I can hook you up with that a little later.

01:29:50.780 --> 01:29:53.780
Alright, I got the songs loaded. What are the songs here?

01:29:53.780 --> 01:29:59.780
Okay, the song, uh, the artist is, uh, 4-1-4, and the song title is Double Thrash.

01:29:59.780 --> 01:30:01.780
Okay, we have a little clip of that one here.

01:30:06.780 --> 01:30:08.780
Alright, cool.

01:30:08.780 --> 01:30:13.780
Um, let me check, uh, it's, uh, by Hoshino Kanako, and it's, uh, Get Cool.

01:30:13.780 --> 01:30:16.780
Is that this one that doesn't have a label on it? Is that this one?

01:30:19.780 --> 01:30:21.780
Oh, that's not, uh, that's not Get Cool.

01:30:21.780 --> 01:30:22.420
well

01:30:22.420 --> 01:30:24.780
well i don't know which one i was then

01:30:24.780 --> 01:30:27.100
maybe i don't have that one

01:30:27.100 --> 01:30:29.020
do you know which one i was i just played

01:30:29.020 --> 01:30:30.620
on nevermind out

01:30:30.620 --> 01:30:31.900
out of the failure

01:30:31.900 --> 01:30:34.300
well i'll just say the next on it

01:30:34.300 --> 01:30:36.700
plasma by uh...

01:30:36.700 --> 01:30:39.700
yeah plasma by uh... used i think uh...

01:30:39.700 --> 01:30:40.620
but i don't know

01:30:40.620 --> 01:30:43.200
i thought it would you worry did plasma yes

01:30:43.200 --> 01:30:50.200
yet but yeah i here's a clip of plasma

01:30:52.480 --> 01:30:54.480
without medical

01:30:54.480 --> 01:30:57.000
and i don't like every other sort of who's my son that's right

01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:00.040
and then the next time is the or are by you start

01:31:00.040 --> 01:31:02.180
uh...

01:31:02.180 --> 01:31:06.180
i don't know if i have that one did you send me everything

01:31:06.180 --> 01:31:07.240
i have a except

01:31:07.240 --> 01:31:11.100
but i've got them ok alright

01:31:11.100 --> 01:31:12.980
and then the last one is uh...

01:31:12.980 --> 01:31:17.180
This is going to be very complicated to say.

01:31:17.180 --> 01:31:17.900
It's by Ginger.

01:31:17.900 --> 01:31:20.580
It's called casteless while eyejaw cancel tissue.

01:31:28.980 --> 01:31:31.140
That sounds like it should have a long, complicated name.

01:31:31.140 --> 01:31:31.940
That's kind of interesting.

01:31:31.940 --> 01:31:33.020
OK.

01:31:33.020 --> 01:31:34.620
This one's translated in English.

01:31:34.620 --> 01:31:36.580
Casteless while eyejaw cancel tissue.

01:31:36.580 --> 01:31:39.140
I just translated it on some site.

01:31:39.140 --> 01:31:46.860
it says that cast less is a tissue that cancels love what that's what it's

01:31:46.860 --> 01:31:53.820
translated okay what the hell weird very weird and here's some stuff that you

01:31:53.820 --> 01:31:58.660
know like some how should I say it about hidden plus and sudden plus here's

01:31:58.660 --> 01:32:05.500
something interesting mm-hmm um on hidden plus and plus you can actually

01:32:05.500 --> 01:32:15.500
You can actually change the width of the cover, not only before the song begins, but also during gameplay by holding the start button and adjusting it with a turntable.

01:32:16.500 --> 01:32:22.500
Weird. So you can actually adjust the windows that you're hiding or, you know, either way. That's kind of neat.

01:32:23.500 --> 01:32:27.500
Yeah. Not only before the song starts, but during gameplay.

01:32:27.500 --> 01:32:32.760
Wow, that's kind of cool. I like that. So like if you decide that oh a little too much on the sudden thing

01:32:32.760 --> 01:32:36.960
Or maybe I put it on accidentally then I could just use the start button to like take it off

01:32:37.440 --> 01:32:42.400
By rolling it so much that it would just not be there. That's kind of neat. Yeah, and then

01:32:43.100 --> 01:32:49.360
There's already a new way of accessing the extra stage, which is a scream squad by cap

01:32:50.600 --> 01:32:52.600
mm-hmm and

01:32:52.600 --> 01:32:57.000
the way you do it is on the first and second stage you have to double A and

01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:01.720
another of any level with hard mode oh so you can get the extra stage that way

01:33:01.720 --> 01:33:08.120
just by double laying in another on hard I'm not done yet oh okay on the final

01:33:08.120 --> 01:33:13.280
stage you have to double a a level 10 or higher either in hyper or another with

01:33:13.280 --> 01:33:21.000
hard mode no random no mirror and that's to get the one more extra stage no that's

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
That's how you get the extra stage.

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:26.000
Really? Oh, dang. So they just raised the bar on that, basically.

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:27.000
More complicated, yeah.

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:37.000
Usually on the previous 2DX styles, like until 2DX Red, you just double A Level 8 another with hard mode.

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:38.000
Wow.

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:41.000
That's the simplest way, but now they made it more complicated.

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
Well, that's because people are getting too good at the game.

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:46.000
You can say that.

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:53.000
Okay, so up in the challenge factor a little bit there, so if you get that extra stage, you're even more special and more crazy.

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
But that's cool. Very cool.

01:33:55.000 --> 01:34:03.000
Let me correct myself here. One of the Happy Sky songs, I said it on a previous, before the song was released,

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:10.000
it's by a dance man featuring disco. The correct title is we are disco yotsu uchi inochi.

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
That's a fun little name to it, okay.

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:16.000
So wait, that was one that we had misnamed on a previous show?

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:19.000
Actually, I mispronounced it.

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:23.000
Wow, you mispronounced something for a change. That's a change.

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:24.000
Usually I'm the one making those mistakes.

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:25.000
I'm not perfect, you know.

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:29.000
That's alright. Neither am I. At least now we know.

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:32.000
Well, thank you for issuing that correction. That was very honest of you.

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
I wish the regular media could be that way.

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:37.000
Anything else you want to share with us about the 2DX world?

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:51.880
Well, just to name some artists, I'll just name them the artists that have songs.

01:34:51.880 --> 01:35:02.820
Don't Let It Go by Uchi's, Uchi the Brothers, and then there's Spark by Silver Fox Productions

01:35:02.820 --> 01:35:10.660
featuring Hoshino Kanako, and then there's Under the Sky by Minami Sayaka from B4U with

01:35:10.660 --> 01:35:20.660
Platonix. What else? Yeah, there's Happy Angel by Junpichi Takirik, or Tahiri, and then there's

01:35:22.660 --> 01:35:24.980
These are more songs that are in Happy Sky, yes?

01:35:24.980 --> 01:35:28.900
Yeah, the ones that have Japanese characters that you might not understand.

01:35:28.900 --> 01:35:30.500
Gotcha, okay, okay.

01:35:30.500 --> 01:35:37.500
And then there's Garden by Aokiriye. I'll just type them after, you know, after this, after this call.

01:35:37.500 --> 01:35:38.500
Works for me.

01:35:38.500 --> 01:35:45.500
Yeah, whenever there are sound titles, just point me out and I'll type them in.

01:35:45.500 --> 01:35:46.500
Sounds good.

01:35:46.500 --> 01:35:47.500
Yeah.

01:35:47.500 --> 01:35:50.500
Alrighty. Well, thanks for the call, Siggy. We appreciate it.

01:35:50.500 --> 01:35:51.500
Alright.

01:35:51.500 --> 01:35:52.500
Have a good one.

01:35:52.500 --> 01:35:53.500
Alright, later.

01:35:53.500 --> 01:35:54.500
Later.

01:35:54.500 --> 01:35:56.500
That's our resident 2DX whore, Siggy.

01:35:56.500 --> 01:35:57.500
Yay, whore.

01:35:57.500 --> 01:36:04.460
calling us I was I was gonna load the it's so much fun clip again but I think

01:36:04.460 --> 01:36:10.700
we've really got it the ground you're right what's so much fun playing the

01:36:10.700 --> 01:36:14.900
clip over and over is that yes actually it is tons of fun somebody said they

01:36:14.900 --> 01:36:20.380
were gonna make a YTM ND comm site out of that you know what that that's the

01:36:20.380 --> 01:36:26.180
site where um oh the one I think of is the the con one have you seen that site

01:36:26.180 --> 01:36:29.000
It just repeats that file over and over.

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:30.000
Con!

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:31.000
Con!

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:34.840
And that's the background is the, you know, William Shatner going, ah!

01:36:34.840 --> 01:36:35.840
Somebody was going to make a site.

01:36:35.840 --> 01:36:42.600
And you know how, like, now they have this site where you can build your own YTMND site?

01:36:42.600 --> 01:36:45.300
Somebody's going to build one of those for you, going to, oh, it's so much fun.

01:36:45.300 --> 01:36:46.300
Oh, it's so much fun.

01:36:46.300 --> 01:36:47.300
It'll be hilarious.

01:36:47.300 --> 01:36:48.300
Anyway, we got another call on Skype.

01:36:48.300 --> 01:36:49.300
That sounds like a winner.

01:36:49.300 --> 01:36:51.140
Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio.

01:36:51.140 --> 01:36:56.380
I'm sorry, but I have to do a little rant here about the whole hot coffee thing.

01:36:56.380 --> 01:36:58.520
You have to introduce yourself first.

01:36:58.520 --> 01:36:59.760
I'm Reznor.

01:36:59.760 --> 01:37:03.240
Hi, Reznor. Reznor calls us quite a bit. The resident drunk.

01:37:03.240 --> 01:37:08.020
Hey, we like that. I was the resident drunk last night, but I'm okay now.

01:37:08.020 --> 01:37:09.260
Sorry, but

01:37:09.260 --> 01:37:12.160
the whole media finding...

01:37:12.160 --> 01:37:15.220
the media is basically behind the times on anything that

01:37:15.220 --> 01:37:19.500
relates to anything related with a computer or a video game.

01:37:19.500 --> 01:37:23.820
all hot shit you know there's sex in a video game we can't have this

01:37:23.820 --> 01:37:27.380
but it's fine all right to have people doing drive-bys and uh... shooting

01:37:27.380 --> 01:37:29.200
people as big you know

01:37:29.200 --> 01:37:32.980
and ripping off heads violence is quite alright but doing somebody and the

01:37:32.980 --> 01:37:34.220
asses

01:37:34.220 --> 01:37:38.540
what this this just goes back to what is acceptable in our rated movies as well i

01:37:38.540 --> 01:37:41.940
mean you remember the whole stink with that movie eyes wide shut where

01:37:41.940 --> 01:37:44.780
although they're going to show some titties and some penises and it's going

01:37:44.780 --> 01:37:46.340
to be n c seventeen

01:37:46.340 --> 01:37:50.400
but meanwhile the latest like terminator three where they just blow shit up left

01:37:50.400 --> 01:37:51.080
and right

01:37:51.080 --> 01:37:53.400
is you know just a relatively mild are

01:37:53.400 --> 01:37:58.020
uh... exactly this is a decent point of of horrendous violence being killed

01:37:58.020 --> 01:37:59.660
completely accepted would be

01:37:59.660 --> 01:38:04.040
dead alive or in a movie this guy is fighting zombies with the

01:38:04.040 --> 01:38:08.420
frickin lawnmower strapped to his own many runs up to a man chops them in half

01:38:08.420 --> 01:38:10.800
not to mention the fact that he is also

01:38:10.800 --> 01:38:12.200
re uh...

01:38:12.200 --> 01:38:16.920
deeper by his demon mother sucked right into her vagina and then pulled right

01:38:16.920 --> 01:38:18.060
the hell back out

01:38:18.060 --> 01:38:21.400
i happen to have a lot to know

01:38:21.400 --> 01:38:26.960
so i i i think i think this is what i mean that many night at my house

01:38:26.960 --> 01:38:31.080
anyway it was not segway well i don't get a lot of and while you're at

01:38:31.080 --> 01:38:33.800
there was a finishes dot right

01:38:33.800 --> 01:38:35.200
i'm sorry but

01:38:35.200 --> 01:38:39.540
the media are complete idiots when it comes to anything technological

01:38:39.540 --> 01:38:40.520
anything

01:38:40.520 --> 01:38:44.800
uh... the you know story on podcasting oh it's so much

01:38:44.800 --> 01:38:49.220
but uh... and i just had a local story and local news is like

01:38:49.220 --> 01:38:53.200
kids are attending these new parties called land parties

01:38:53.200 --> 01:38:58.580
where they come together for twenty four hours of caffeine fuel uh... fun

01:38:58.580 --> 01:39:01.180
playing very violent games and

01:39:01.180 --> 01:39:03.580
swapping the files back and forth

01:39:03.580 --> 01:39:08.740
hello we've been doing this crap since what nineteen ninety five it's just now

01:39:08.740 --> 01:39:10.320
reaching the media

01:39:10.320 --> 01:39:13.920
Play your collective heads out of your asses for a change!

01:39:13.920 --> 01:39:19.040
Oh my god! I remember the LAN forum, because that's the only way you could play like Doom 2

01:39:19.040 --> 01:39:21.600
multiplayer was to do the LAN thing.

01:39:21.600 --> 01:39:27.760
Yeah, doing dial-up and then having phone calls like five hundred dollars. I remember playing 11 player Duke Nukem 3D on the LAN.

01:39:27.760 --> 01:39:30.800
Oh, that's right, Duke Nukem is another one. Anyway.

01:39:30.800 --> 01:39:32.320
But, I'm sorry, but

01:39:32.320 --> 01:39:36.520
the media is just such horrors. I'd like to round, as I said in the chat room,

01:39:36.520 --> 01:39:40.840
I'd like to round them all up in a pit and re-enact the scene from HUD where they're

01:39:40.840 --> 01:39:42.200
shooting the cattle.

01:39:42.200 --> 01:39:46.120
It's such bullshit!

01:39:46.120 --> 01:39:49.920
You know what amazes me about this whole thing is that Grand Theft Auto is a

01:39:49.920 --> 01:39:53.080
bit of a scapegoat because it's not like we have never had

01:39:53.080 --> 01:39:57.080
sex or very very sexual things in games before.

01:39:57.080 --> 01:40:01.960
This could go all the way back to Custer's Revenge. Now granted Custer's Revenge

01:40:01.960 --> 01:40:03.200
was not a

01:40:03.200 --> 01:40:06.760
a runaway sales hit, shall we say,

01:40:06.760 --> 01:40:09.760
and neither was Night Trap, even though that game didn't have sex in it,

01:40:09.760 --> 01:40:12.960
but God of War has a sex minigame in it.

01:40:12.960 --> 01:40:16.080
I think the only reason that they're scapegoating, you know,

01:40:16.080 --> 01:40:20.440
Grand Theft Auto is because it's been, you know, in the spotlight before.

01:40:20.440 --> 01:40:23.800
I'm surprised they didn't start whipping out Doom 3 and just saying,

01:40:23.800 --> 01:40:27.120
oh, there's, you know, there's demonology and rituals,

01:40:27.120 --> 01:40:30.800
and, you know, there's blood all over the place. But that's okay, because that's blood.

01:40:30.800 --> 01:40:36.320
Exactly, but they're only scapegoating GTA because it was in the spotlight before

01:40:36.320 --> 01:40:41.840
and they just want to rile up the collection of Bible thumping parents out there

01:40:41.840 --> 01:40:46.960
and say, oh look, there's titties and a money shot. Ignore the fact that you can

01:40:46.960 --> 01:40:50.400
the game says the F word and nigger half the time.

01:40:50.400 --> 01:40:54.840
Yeah, that's great though, too. Like I predicted,

01:40:54.840 --> 01:40:58.320
this is only the beginning. It's the whole nipple gate all over again and as we'll be

01:40:58.320 --> 01:40:59.880
covering in our podcast later,

01:40:59.880 --> 01:41:02.880
They're coming after Sims 2's nude patch now.

01:41:02.880 --> 01:41:06.880
Oh yeah, there's a huge thing that it's appealing to pedophiles.

01:41:06.880 --> 01:41:11.880
Hey Newsflash, there are Ken dolls underneath those blurs.

01:41:11.880 --> 01:41:13.880
There's a huge difference.

01:41:13.880 --> 01:41:15.880
There's nothing there.

01:41:15.880 --> 01:41:16.880
Not on the patch that I have.

01:41:16.880 --> 01:41:18.880
Even the website doesn't even have nipples.

01:41:18.880 --> 01:41:21.880
There's a huge difference too between the Sims 2 thing and the Grand Theft Auto thing.

01:41:21.880 --> 01:41:26.880
As I pointed out earlier, I believe the Grand Theft Auto thing to be a case of lazy programming.

01:41:26.880 --> 01:41:33.280
Whereas the Sims 2 thing is somebody made a patch to alter the game.

01:41:33.280 --> 01:41:38.280
They are not putting back in like a pointer that was taken out to code that was on the game.

01:41:38.280 --> 01:41:40.780
They don't do that research. I understand that.

01:41:40.780 --> 01:41:45.280
Next thing you know, you'll have Jerry Falwell saying that because when the males get abducted by aliens

01:41:45.280 --> 01:41:50.280
and become pregnant with alien babies, that it's going to be a great thing for gay rights

01:41:50.280 --> 01:41:52.280
and it's all against Christianity.

01:41:52.280 --> 01:41:56.280
Somebody needs to get up there and explain, you know what, and if this thing ends up coming before Congress,

01:41:56.280 --> 01:42:02.360
which is just just might remember like years ago like 15 years ago it was about the naughty lyrics in music and

01:42:02.620 --> 01:42:07.240
Fucking he got D Snyder from twisted sister testifying before the special congress panel

01:42:07.360 --> 01:42:09.240
That's what's gonna happen with this whole thing

01:42:09.240 --> 01:42:15.720
and I hope to God when that happens that they break it down into second grade language for these people so that they understand and

01:42:15.720 --> 01:42:21.000
draw pictures if you have to to understand the difference between what happened with Grantham federal San Andreas and

01:42:21.320 --> 01:42:24.980
People outright making the nude patches for other games. I mean God there

01:42:24.980 --> 01:42:29.580
within like five seconds of the Tomb Raider game being out somebody

01:42:29.580 --> 01:42:32.740
had a patch so you could see Lara Croft's pussy. I mean that's just...

01:42:32.740 --> 01:42:36.980
I still think that our society is so fucked up that

01:42:36.980 --> 01:42:41.480
where you can rip somebody's head off with the spine attached dangly with

01:42:41.480 --> 01:42:42.820
blood dripping off of it

01:42:42.820 --> 01:42:47.280
it's considered alright when a money shot of man goo in the face of a

01:42:47.280 --> 01:42:48.860
woman on her knees is so

01:42:48.860 --> 01:42:54.380
taboo. But to put it in perspective though the spinal cord attached to the

01:42:54.380 --> 01:42:58.740
head thing, and I assume you're referencing Mortal Kombat, I seem to recall that did have

01:42:58.740 --> 01:42:59.740
this whole theory of media detection with it.

01:42:59.740 --> 01:43:01.740
It did, you have a big stink on it.

01:43:01.740 --> 01:43:03.780
That's why it wasn't in the Super Nintendo.

01:43:03.780 --> 01:43:04.780
Right.

01:43:04.780 --> 01:43:05.780
But, now here's the difference.

01:43:05.780 --> 01:43:08.640
They didn't try to ban the game, well, no, they did try to ban the game, but they didn't

01:43:08.640 --> 01:43:13.620
do this whole, oh, I guess the ratings thing was really born because of that.

01:43:13.620 --> 01:43:18.400
And when they went and rated Mortal Kombat M, that seemed to appease the moral police

01:43:18.400 --> 01:43:19.660
a little bit.

01:43:19.660 --> 01:43:23.780
basically what it's basically boiling down to is

01:43:23.780 --> 01:43:27.100
their society is just basically not taking

01:43:27.100 --> 01:43:30.400
taking the blame or taking responsibility for their own kids the

01:43:30.400 --> 01:43:33.420
parents basically just want to sit them down in front of the idiot box

01:43:33.420 --> 01:43:35.180
and then it makes it though

01:43:35.180 --> 01:43:37.500
you know it's because the parents aren't

01:43:37.500 --> 01:43:41.540
you know watching out for what their kids play what they watch what they do

01:43:41.540 --> 01:43:42.760
on the internet

01:43:42.760 --> 01:43:45.900
that when something like this in grand theft auto happens

01:43:45.900 --> 01:43:47.620
or heavens forbid you know

01:43:47.620 --> 01:43:52.400
Doom caught a lot of shit because the whole Columbine thing, I know that it probably

01:43:52.400 --> 01:43:55.920
strums somebody's strings the wrong way with that.

01:43:55.920 --> 01:43:57.800
But damn it, Doom's not the problem.

01:43:57.800 --> 01:43:59.680
Dran Theft Auto is not the problem.

01:43:59.680 --> 01:44:02.280
It's parents that aren't doing their damn job.

01:44:02.280 --> 01:44:04.520
I'll bet you anything here is what happens about this.

01:44:04.520 --> 01:44:07.880
Because parents are lazy and can't figure out how to do these things themselves,

01:44:07.880 --> 01:44:09.640
remember what they had to do for televisions.

01:44:09.640 --> 01:44:13.840
That it's mandatory that the V-chip be installed in all television sets so that

01:44:13.840 --> 01:44:19.840
that you can block programs above a certain rating if you want to.

01:44:19.840 --> 01:44:23.840
So that way parents could still leave their kids unattended and the TV does the babysitting for them.

01:44:23.840 --> 01:44:28.840
The only problem with that is the parents are half stupid about even they can't even work the VCR

01:44:28.840 --> 01:44:31.840
at the time and the kids have already figured a way to hack around the VTIMS.

01:44:31.840 --> 01:44:33.840
I'm not going to disagree with you there.

01:44:33.840 --> 01:44:39.840
But I bet you anything as a result of this, it's going to be required in these next-gen systems

01:44:39.840 --> 01:44:41.840
that they do some similar type of...

01:44:41.840 --> 01:44:47.040
I really crazy they already have that it's already in the PlayStation 2

01:44:47.040 --> 01:44:50.560
it's already on the PSP it's already on the Xbox they're pre-programmed in there

01:44:50.560 --> 01:44:54.240
but guess what nobody knows about it because exactly because they don't

01:44:54.240 --> 01:44:57.680
they're not responsible parents just like you know even if this game is adults

01:44:57.680 --> 01:45:00.640
only kids are still going to be playing it because their dumbass parents

01:45:00.640 --> 01:45:03.680
go and buy it for them you know what I hope happens

01:45:03.680 --> 01:45:07.800
here's what I hope happens the game gets rated adults only fuck it let's do

01:45:07.800 --> 01:45:09.040
whatever the fuck we want

01:45:09.040 --> 01:45:15.180
I want to have it where the main character goes and rapes babies, and it sets people on fire.

01:45:15.180 --> 01:45:18.860
Fuck it, you know what? I can do it now because it is an adults-only game.

01:45:18.860 --> 01:45:21.740
So fuck you, can't say shit, adults only.

01:45:21.740 --> 01:45:26.300
You just make a game that says, fuck your children, this is adults only.

01:45:26.300 --> 01:45:33.800
I want to be able to ride around in a car that has a collective of child heads lined up on the front of the car for the grill,

01:45:33.800 --> 01:45:38.360
and also have a rocket launcher that fires chickens butt-first out of it

01:45:38.360 --> 01:45:42.640
towards little old ladies that are carrying groceries and if you happen to knock one old lady

01:45:42.640 --> 01:45:48.120
into another and her head gets stuck up to her butt, you get a bonus score

01:45:48.120 --> 01:45:49.200
wow

01:45:49.200 --> 01:45:49.960
uh...

01:45:49.960 --> 01:45:51.180
but look

01:45:51.180 --> 01:45:56.080
here's the problem though with the AO you know we're going to have this adults only orgy

01:45:56.080 --> 01:45:57.320
of games now

01:45:57.320 --> 01:46:01.060
the thing is is that the targets uh... not really the targets but they're

01:46:01.060 --> 01:46:05.060
are a part of it. The Walmarts of the world, the Best Buys of the world, the Game Stops

01:46:05.060 --> 01:46:10.580
and... Oh, don't even get me started on stupid fucking Walmarts. All these stores, all the

01:46:10.580 --> 01:46:13.900
big stores are going to pull, they're not going to have these games because they're

01:46:13.900 --> 01:46:17.940
the equivalent of porn. So the only way you're going to ever find these AO games is in the

01:46:17.940 --> 01:46:23.020
back room of some video clearance center run down shack. Hey, time for the mom and pops

01:46:23.020 --> 01:46:26.060
to come back. You know, what if these big store chains don't want to carry the hot games

01:46:26.060 --> 01:46:30.060
out there with people, go to other places and find them. That's what the Internet's

01:46:30.060 --> 01:46:32.060
for. It's a wired world out there.

01:46:32.060 --> 01:46:33.060
Exactly. Fuck Walmart.

01:46:33.060 --> 01:46:36.060
Who cares? No one buys games anymore anyways. They're always pirating them off the internet.

01:46:36.060 --> 01:46:39.060
You can probably end up buying them out of vending machines in Japan.

01:46:39.060 --> 01:46:44.820
Yeah, so I want to buy an adults only game right next to being able to buy beer and sweaty

01:46:44.820 --> 01:46:53.820
girls panties. Shit, I'm out of beer.

01:46:53.820 --> 01:46:57.060
can't say we necessarily disagree with you you've got you bring an interesting

01:46:57.060 --> 01:47:00.720
perspective to it and I'll tell you what you you should be a game designer because

01:47:00.720 --> 01:47:05.760
I think the the raping grandma game or whatever you had here going on here was

01:47:05.760 --> 01:47:12.840
pretty hot and I'd buy it raping grandmas three with the new raccoon tail

01:47:12.840 --> 01:47:19.320
power-up it's the grandma game cuz you could fuck grandma across the Oregon

01:47:19.320 --> 01:47:21.640
all right here

01:47:21.640 --> 01:47:25.640
you just want to work in the words oregon trail into the show didn't you

01:47:25.640 --> 01:47:29.080
and i don't really want to let you know you're right

01:47:29.080 --> 01:47:31.360
that that the game that you're talking about

01:47:31.360 --> 01:47:34.320
public separate two thousand

01:47:34.320 --> 01:47:36.760
actually yes it does

01:47:36.760 --> 01:47:38.560
can you imagine it yet

01:47:38.560 --> 01:47:42.080
can you imagine do you can you imagine the grandma game though where they've

01:47:42.080 --> 01:47:43.080
got you know

01:47:43.080 --> 01:47:47.080
all here's grandma number one it's a mod and uh...

01:47:47.080 --> 01:47:51.080
Hey, Grandma Maude, answer this question. You gotta flash your titties.

01:47:51.080 --> 01:47:56.080
Whoa, whoa, okay, that's what the one instance I agree against porn.

01:47:56.080 --> 01:48:00.080
You say Maude, and I think of Bea Arthur now.

01:48:00.080 --> 01:48:03.080
So that's scary, because she had that show.

01:48:03.080 --> 01:48:07.080
And then you have the movie Airheads, it's like, I want naked pictures of Bea Arthur.

01:48:07.080 --> 01:48:10.080
And it's like, no you don't, no you don't.

01:48:10.080 --> 01:48:14.080
All right, all kidding aside, you bring up some good points, Reznor,

01:48:14.080 --> 01:48:16.920
and uh... i hope america's listening

01:48:16.920 --> 01:48:20.240
uh... long live u s a all right now

01:48:20.240 --> 01:48:22.560
uh... any other final thoughts for us

01:48:22.560 --> 01:48:25.940
uh... now i'll save it for the f-use sounds good to me thank you for being a

01:48:25.940 --> 01:48:26.840
friend

01:48:26.840 --> 01:48:28.800
okay have a good one

01:48:28.800 --> 01:48:29.960
uh...

01:48:29.960 --> 01:48:32.320
you're the kind of thing we encourage

01:48:32.320 --> 01:48:36.740
and i'm not the real and then just let's into the uh...

01:48:36.740 --> 01:48:38.360
one more call

01:48:38.360 --> 01:48:40.640
higher on all of us radio

01:48:40.640 --> 01:48:45.040
Loki for president, please. I nominate Loki for president. That was just awesome.

01:48:45.040 --> 01:48:48.280
Oh, come on. His ego doesn't need any more of that, please.

01:48:48.280 --> 01:48:51.320
Hey, you could be vice president, Doc Sucker could be the first lady.

01:48:51.320 --> 01:48:56.080
No, I'm the need dictator.

01:48:56.080 --> 01:48:57.820
I'm the Illuminati!

01:48:57.820 --> 01:49:01.360
Jamie would be evil dictator of the country that would start

01:49:01.360 --> 01:49:05.380
World War III with Loki's country. That's kind of how it would work, so...

01:49:05.380 --> 01:49:10.360
Right now, I want her and Hillary Clinton in a ring, three minutes, no polls,

01:49:10.360 --> 01:49:12.360
No TQ match, that's what I want.

01:49:12.360 --> 01:49:15.360
I keep taking out the brass knucks and breaking her face.

01:49:15.360 --> 01:49:20.360
Wow! I'm glad this is uncensored radio, because we could get an AO right now.

01:49:20.360 --> 01:49:22.360
Bitch, no you didn't!

01:49:22.360 --> 01:49:25.360
Fuck that bullshit, just bring it on.

01:49:25.360 --> 01:49:31.360
I was going to say, I was going to run that clip again.

01:49:31.360 --> 01:49:34.360
Loki, what do you think about running for president? Oh, it's so fun.

01:49:34.360 --> 01:49:37.360
But, um, I'm too lazy to queue up the clip again.

01:49:37.360 --> 01:49:40.360
So, what else is on your mind, my friend?

01:49:40.360 --> 01:49:47.360
This is Ron John, by the way, and a lot of crazy things have been happening to me the last couple of days, the last two, three days.

01:49:47.360 --> 01:49:51.360
Like, what kinds of crazy things, like...

01:49:51.360 --> 01:49:56.360
I didn't forget it. I was going to make a sitcom reference or something. Forget it.

01:49:56.360 --> 01:49:59.360
What kinds of crazy things?

01:49:59.360 --> 01:50:05.360
Let's say I might order a package for a friend of mine for a birthday gift. It shows up the day after the party.

01:50:05.360 --> 01:50:10.360
Um, my family just went into utter turmoil right now, so...

01:50:10.360 --> 01:50:11.360
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

01:50:11.360 --> 01:50:15.360
Oh, you don't know how...oh, well, I'll probably PM you that later, but um...

01:50:15.360 --> 01:50:16.360
Okay.

01:50:16.360 --> 01:50:20.360
On the good side, I just found out there's going to be an anime con in Sacramento this weekend.

01:50:20.360 --> 01:50:25.360
I heard about some anime con that's going to be at the mall or something, right?

01:50:25.360 --> 01:50:26.360
Oh, goody! Not that one again!

01:50:26.360 --> 01:50:29.360
I sent Jamie the information already.

01:50:29.360 --> 01:50:32.360
You know what? Remember the last time?

01:50:32.360 --> 01:50:36.360
I saw the email and then I got bombarded, so, sorry.

01:50:36.360 --> 01:50:38.360
It's okay.

01:50:38.360 --> 01:50:40.360
Remember the last time I went to that thing?

01:50:40.360 --> 01:50:45.360
I'm afraid of anime cons in a mall.

01:50:45.360 --> 01:50:50.360
It was okay. It was basically a bunch of vendors getting together to sell shit. I mean, it was okay.

01:50:50.360 --> 01:50:52.360
The typical sunrise fest.

01:50:52.360 --> 01:50:57.360
The video room was the old McDonald's that is converted into, like, every store possible.

01:50:57.360 --> 01:50:59.360
That was pretty funny, I have to admit.

01:50:59.360 --> 01:51:07.360
Anime Cons of the Mall, I got you beat. My anime cosplay club had like a little picnic in Central Park last weekend.

01:51:07.360 --> 01:51:12.360
We came across another cosplaying group known as the Naruto Crack Crew.

01:51:12.360 --> 01:51:17.360
They came in full Naruto cosplay gear and we're just staring at them.

01:51:17.360 --> 01:51:20.360
Wow, that's awesome.

01:51:20.360 --> 01:51:24.360
I mean, I wore my forehead protector and that was it.

01:51:24.360 --> 01:51:29.640
I mean, no more Naru tarts, please. God, no.

01:51:29.640 --> 01:51:34.960
Wow, um, we might go check out the con. My only problem is that I'm actually flying out

01:51:34.960 --> 01:51:38.060
to the East Coast on Sunday, which I think is the day that the majority of the con is

01:51:38.060 --> 01:51:43.760
taking place, so I don't know if I personally can go, but maybe my esteemed co-presenters

01:51:43.760 --> 01:51:44.960
can go. Go where?

01:51:44.960 --> 01:51:50.200
I'll think about it. The, the, um, the anime con at the mall. Go hand out flyers for our

01:51:50.200 --> 01:51:52.600
show. I'll go buy a pretzel, because I like their

01:51:52.600 --> 01:51:54.600
There you go. There you go.

01:51:54.600 --> 01:51:56.600
Get me a box of tofu.

01:51:56.600 --> 01:51:58.600
Are you still meeting me when I come out to the East Coast?

01:51:58.600 --> 01:52:03.600
Yes, a few of my friends are going to get together after the tournament. We want to drag you off to a diner.

01:52:03.600 --> 01:52:04.600
Sounds good to me.

01:52:04.600 --> 01:52:05.600
Yeah.

01:52:05.600 --> 01:52:09.600
Alright, as long as I'm back at the East now, because I do have to work the next day, but yes, I do that.

01:52:09.600 --> 01:52:10.600
It's a full problem.

01:52:10.600 --> 01:52:11.600
Alright.

01:52:11.600 --> 01:52:13.600
We'll keep the alcohol to a minimum, okay?

01:52:13.600 --> 01:52:15.600
Sounds good to me, because I have a low tolerance.

01:52:15.600 --> 01:52:16.600
Alright.

01:52:16.600 --> 01:52:17.600
Excellent.

01:52:17.600 --> 01:52:18.600
Anything else you want to share with us today?

01:52:18.600 --> 01:52:23.240
Can I get a request of Let's Groove, my tips and tricks, please?

01:52:23.240 --> 01:52:25.040
I will try and work it in a little later.

01:52:25.040 --> 01:52:26.040
Sweet.

01:52:26.040 --> 01:52:27.880
Send me a private message so I don't forget.

01:52:27.880 --> 01:52:28.880
I will.

01:52:28.880 --> 01:52:29.880
All right.

01:52:29.880 --> 01:52:30.880
Later, my friend.

01:52:30.880 --> 01:52:31.880
Later.

01:52:31.880 --> 01:52:32.880
Bye-bye.

01:52:32.880 --> 01:52:33.880
All right.

01:52:33.880 --> 01:52:35.160
Good calls tonight, boys and girls.

01:52:35.160 --> 01:52:36.440
We appreciate...

01:52:36.440 --> 01:52:38.000
We like our intelligent listeners.

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:41.360
This is what really motivates us to do what we do here.

01:52:41.360 --> 01:52:42.360
All right.

01:52:42.360 --> 01:52:44.620
And now something that takes no intelligence whatsoever.

01:52:44.620 --> 01:52:46.500
The Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match.

01:52:46.500 --> 01:52:52.300
In tonight's cage match, three songs will do battle.

01:52:52.300 --> 01:52:53.460
Whoops, where'd Halleck go?

01:52:53.460 --> 01:52:54.300
There we go.

01:52:54.300 --> 01:52:56.460
Three songs will do battle in tonight's cage match.

01:52:56.460 --> 01:52:58.100
Last week's winner, you get a clip of it,

01:52:58.100 --> 01:52:59.740
two brand new songs.

01:52:59.740 --> 01:53:02.840
Your votes in the chat room at orangeloungeradio.com,

01:53:02.840 --> 01:53:05.880
clicking on chat, will determine the winner.

01:53:05.880 --> 01:53:08.200
And the winning song goes into rotation all week long

01:53:08.200 --> 01:53:09.620
on Orange Lounge Radio Live,

01:53:09.620 --> 01:53:11.540
the London Music and More program.

01:53:11.540 --> 01:53:15.780
All right, first up we get last week's winner,

01:53:15.780 --> 01:53:17.780
last week in the Orange Lounge Cage Match,

01:53:17.780 --> 01:53:21.340
a very interesting spin on a 70s classic one

01:53:21.340 --> 01:53:22.860
and it was kind of one of those moments

01:53:22.860 --> 01:53:25.180
where Dark Soccer and I went, huh?

01:53:25.180 --> 01:53:26.860
But you guys voted for it.

01:53:26.860 --> 01:53:29.580
You voted for Loki's pick of Ozzy Osbourne

01:53:29.580 --> 01:53:31.340
with Stayin' Alive, so it comes back

01:53:31.340 --> 01:53:32.940
as song number one this week.

01:53:32.940 --> 01:53:35.140
Here's a clip, Ozzy Osbourne, Stayin' Alive.

01:54:35.140 --> 01:54:37.140
It's alright, it's okay

01:54:37.140 --> 01:54:39.140
We may go the other way

01:54:39.140 --> 01:54:41.140
But we can't fight, we want the same

01:54:41.140 --> 01:54:45.140
Cause we don't tried to make the man

01:54:48.140 --> 01:54:50.140
It's alright, it's okay

01:54:50.140 --> 01:54:53.140
I'll let you see us navigate

01:54:53.140 --> 01:54:55.140
But we can't fight, we want the same

01:54:55.140 --> 01:54:58.140
It's your time to think of me

01:55:25.140 --> 01:55:32.900
All right, that was song number one in tonight's cage match. Ozzy Osbourne was staying alive.

01:55:32.900 --> 01:55:35.900
All right, song number two in tonight's cage match. We're going to do my pick for song

01:55:35.900 --> 01:55:40.180
number two. And I've decided to pick this group. It's somebody I got turned on to by

01:55:40.180 --> 01:55:43.820
a friend who just saw them live recently. And I went and downloaded some of their stuff

01:55:43.820 --> 01:55:48.280
on iTunes and I really dug it. So I wanted to share one of their songs with you guys.

01:55:48.280 --> 01:55:52.660
They have one of those funny foreign names. I think they're Icelandic. So I might mispronounce

01:55:52.660 --> 01:55:56.700
the band name and I if I do I apologize you know all those Icelandic bands have

01:55:56.700 --> 01:56:01.960
a really funny names like Bjork no it's Bjork but it's actually pronounced

01:56:01.960 --> 01:56:05.400
Bjork but everybody says Bjork and then there's what Sigurjós and all those

01:56:05.400 --> 01:56:10.480
bands too Sigurjós or whatever Figaro oh my god they should have like all

01:56:10.480 --> 01:56:14.660
the Icelandic bands do like one song together not all three of them not to

01:56:14.660 --> 01:56:17.720
make fun of Icelandic bands because there's actually some pretty kick-ass

01:56:17.720 --> 01:56:29.560
music from Iceland. It's just funny names. So anyway, this band is Royksop, and the song

01:56:29.560 --> 01:56:33.560
is called Only This Moment, and it's song number two in tonight's cage match. Enjoy.

01:56:59.560 --> 01:57:17.880
Nothing else there, no one to guide us Lost in the senses, deep down inside

01:57:17.880 --> 01:57:20.880
I'm inside, I know I'm about to die

01:57:47.880 --> 01:58:02.880
We are lost in confusion Feelings of the skin of the ocean

01:58:02.880 --> 01:58:06.380
In the end, she'll stay on the sidewalk

01:58:06.380 --> 01:58:08.380
On the sidewalk

01:58:23.680 --> 01:58:26.680
Stay your forever girl

01:58:27.480 --> 01:58:30.480
Play all you never know

01:58:30.480 --> 01:58:38.480
We're heaven-denided, you can't deny us It's all you've been waiting for

01:58:38.480 --> 01:58:46.480
Okay, stay your forever kind Play your never mind

01:58:46.480 --> 01:58:54.480
Your spirit's divided, you will desire It's the more you've been waiting for

01:58:54.480 --> 01:59:00.480
I held in my head, held in my heart, and was raised by the voice of the nature

01:59:00.480 --> 01:59:06.480
Feeling and facing everything exactly I do understand

01:59:06.480 --> 01:59:10.480
Finding love is a path of again

01:59:10.480 --> 01:59:15.480
Voices within me expressing the last thought of creation exactly

01:59:15.480 --> 01:59:21.480
I might think it was cross-hairs, but might lose it by taking the chance

01:59:21.480 --> 01:59:25.480
And so I'm not here about pain, it's just a video

01:59:25.480 --> 01:59:26.480
Okay

01:59:26.480 --> 01:59:29.480
We'll be the most conscious together

01:59:29.480 --> 01:59:31.480
Close to perfection

01:59:31.480 --> 01:59:33.480
We'll be the thing that I'll say

01:59:33.480 --> 01:59:37.480
Always be the trust in my senses

01:59:37.480 --> 01:59:39.480
Do you know what I'm saying?

01:59:39.480 --> 01:59:41.480
We'll be so fine

01:59:41.480 --> 01:59:45.480
We'll be the most conscious together

01:59:45.480 --> 01:59:47.480
Close to perfection

02:00:17.480 --> 02:00:31.800
All right, that was song number two in tonight's cage match.

02:00:31.800 --> 02:00:35.040
That was Roiksop with Only This Moment.

02:00:35.040 --> 02:00:39.320
Let's see if the other folks in the room liked it or didn't.

02:00:39.320 --> 02:00:40.400
Dark Sakura.

02:00:40.400 --> 02:00:43.640
I liked it, but it was probably something I'd listen to if I was trying to go to sleep

02:00:43.640 --> 02:00:46.000
or like working on a picture or something.

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:51.240
very good oh it gets me Loki actually kind of like that I would give it any as

02:00:51.240 --> 02:00:57.640
well Jonas explicit I'll give it like an 8.5 on this one I actually like the

02:00:57.640 --> 02:01:03.360
tunes kind of like you might be back in the 8-bit days because of those tunes

02:01:03.360 --> 02:01:08.260
yeah that's how I like about it it makes me feel relaxed and stuff it gives up a

02:01:08.260 --> 02:01:15.160
bad day very cool usually I would give that song a 9.5 but because the band has

02:01:15.160 --> 02:01:18.520
a hard to pronounce name, I'm giving it a 9. I'm docking it a half point for a crazy

02:01:18.520 --> 02:01:27.360
name. I don't care if it has cultural relevance. Shame shame. It's all good, don't worry. Alright.

02:01:27.360 --> 02:01:30.640
What song are you putting in the Cage Match tonight, Dark Sakura? It's a song we freaking

02:01:30.640 --> 02:01:36.520
should have had in rotation a long time ago, which I was afraid it already was. We have

02:01:36.520 --> 02:01:42.320
a different version, like a different mix. Like the crap version. Yeah. I am a big fan

02:01:42.320 --> 02:01:48.080
of the best move series I always have been I can kick anybody's asses on this

02:01:48.080 --> 02:01:53.360
game challenge me I swear I will own you I challenge you you know I'll own you I

02:01:53.360 --> 02:01:58.200
challenge you on air duel on the first one I used to have all the commands

02:01:58.200 --> 02:02:03.360
memorized I would play without them Wow on on a bust of well for me it was

02:02:03.360 --> 02:02:08.720
busted grooved because I was raised on the u.s. one that is what I played

02:02:08.720 --> 02:02:14.040
non-stop before DDR so I think we would probably have to do like we would just

02:02:14.040 --> 02:02:18.960
get perfect scores all the time it would be it would be a tough match over that

02:02:18.960 --> 02:02:23.040
way all right um anyway this is from the first one it's kitty ends theme song

02:02:23.040 --> 02:02:26.880
from the Japanese one so it's the good version and that the one trying to sound

02:02:26.880 --> 02:02:33.360
like the real McCoy it's I forgot who exactly was a singer on it but it was it

02:02:33.360 --> 02:02:43.360
It actually made top 10 in the charts in Japan, from what I understand, and it's a big Avextrax song, so, uh, it's, uh, I'll show it in a knife.

02:02:43.360 --> 02:02:47.360
Alright, here it is. Song number three. It's an ice cage match.

02:03:43.360 --> 02:03:45.360
Oh

02:04:13.360 --> 02:04:23.360
Uchi, shikare, denmo, nakana, yoyo, ni, menure, ri, ri, yoyo, ni

02:04:29.360 --> 02:04:35.360
Boi, asmaruto ni nishino shimonaku

02:07:05.360 --> 02:07:25.380
Well, where did, where did Hollick go?

02:07:25.380 --> 02:07:26.380
Here it is.

02:07:26.380 --> 02:07:27.380
There we go.

02:07:27.380 --> 02:07:28.380
That was weird.

02:07:28.380 --> 02:07:29.380
Sorry guys.

02:07:29.380 --> 02:07:30.880
That was song number three in tonight's cage match.

02:07:30.880 --> 02:07:37.420
You might know that song from Busted Move, Kitty N's stage, but we're calling it by Avex,

02:07:37.420 --> 02:07:41.660
it's Aosora no Night, Dark Sakura, what do you think?

02:07:41.660 --> 02:07:47.020
And actually, it was pointed out to me that the file actually ripped wrong with the name,

02:07:47.020 --> 02:07:48.020
it's Aozora.

02:07:48.020 --> 02:07:49.020
Oh.

02:07:49.020 --> 02:07:57.660
But, at any rate, yeah, I love that song, I've loved that song forever, it gets an 11.

02:07:57.660 --> 02:07:59.980
Alright, Loki.

02:07:59.980 --> 02:08:06.200
it was 11, but it was okay. I mean, I'd give it a 7. I mean, it sounds just like the original

02:08:06.200 --> 02:08:13.200
one to me. It is the original one. It sounds like the English one, okay? It doesn't matter.

02:08:13.500 --> 02:08:19.880
It's okay. It's just okay. Jonas, I don't see the big difference between the English

02:08:19.880 --> 02:08:24.740
version too much, but except that the Japanese is a little better, but I would say it's 8.

02:08:24.740 --> 02:08:29.220
I like that song a lot. I wish we had had that version of it in our bus to move, but

02:08:29.220 --> 02:08:33.500
we didn't but it's getting it's kind of I don't know it's kind of old that's the

02:08:33.500 --> 02:08:36.060
only thing it has really going against it is that song's kind of been out a

02:08:36.060 --> 02:08:40.940
while but it's still a good song I give it an 8 as well all right let's recap

02:08:40.940 --> 02:08:44.580
the three songs you kids can vote for tonight in the cage match and then you

02:08:44.580 --> 02:08:49.420

02:08:54.020 --> 02:09:11.060
And song number two you can vote for tonight is Royce Scopp with Only This Moment.

02:09:11.060 --> 02:09:18.240

your vote and we'll tally him up and let you know who the wiener is.

02:09:35.760 --> 02:09:39.840
Loki, this is usually the part of the show where I ask you what's going on in the sim scene as if

02:09:39.840 --> 02:09:41.040
you're paying any attention to it.

02:09:41.040 --> 02:09:44.520
I am paying attention to it. I check Bomani's sale

02:09:44.520 --> 02:09:48.120
every day. Okay. From where

02:09:48.120 --> 02:09:51.840
We already talked about Trinity Mix and how we don't care.

02:09:51.840 --> 02:09:55.440
Yeah, last Trinity Mix, in case you missed it last week,

02:09:55.440 --> 02:09:57.120
is coming out pretty soon.

02:09:57.120 --> 02:10:01.400
Get your files in if you really want to participate.

02:10:01.400 --> 02:10:05.360

02:10:05.360 --> 02:10:11.840
And then, of course, the DDROSC competition, the

02:10:11.840 --> 02:10:16.160
psychopath edition, which is all funny files, that was

02:10:16.160 --> 02:10:17.800
judged and I think is over with.

02:10:17.800 --> 02:10:22.240
and nothing else going on

02:10:22.240 --> 02:10:25.520
familiar maybe we should be going to join us for the fifth day i think that

02:10:25.520 --> 02:10:27.680
came out a while ago

02:10:27.680 --> 02:10:31.080
i believe

02:10:31.080 --> 02:10:35.080
to mix you

02:10:35.080 --> 02:10:36.480
he doesn't know

02:10:36.480 --> 02:10:42.200
he doesn't know all right kids cheese

02:10:42.200 --> 02:10:44.280
you retired from the same scene

02:10:44.280 --> 02:10:45.780
You're not making your crazy ass simp files?

02:10:45.780 --> 02:10:51.780
There is a guy that actually posted a song file that said that he made it, I think it was a max remix, that said by Xplicit.

02:10:53.280 --> 02:10:54.280
What the hell?

02:10:54.280 --> 02:10:54.780
Serious?

02:10:55.280 --> 02:10:56.280
I don't make this up.

02:10:57.280 --> 02:10:58.280
Interesting, uh...

02:10:58.280 --> 02:11:05.780
Interesting, I remember this before someone sent, like, two simp files in to be my style, and...

02:11:06.280 --> 02:11:09.280
Ah, but I gotta hammer them too hard, so...

02:11:10.780 --> 02:11:12.280
Except we got some...

02:11:12.280 --> 02:11:13.780
Well, I can't say the word noob.

02:11:13.780 --> 02:11:17.060
Who's that someone else but the put a name explicit alpha?

02:11:17.620 --> 02:11:23.140
Because I'm explicit gamma on the be my install is that some guy named explicit alphas and a follicle

02:11:23.700 --> 02:11:27.540
Legend of transfer doesn't for hello. That's the same person. I just have

02:11:28.240 --> 02:11:31.220
various alpha Beta Gamma Delta Ana was next

02:11:33.020 --> 02:11:35.020
That is all

02:11:36.260 --> 02:11:39.900
All right while I'm tallying up the cage match votes over here

02:11:39.900 --> 02:11:47.580
Why don't you fill us in on some of the other lovely programming we have here on Orange

02:11:47.580 --> 02:11:48.580
Launch Radio.

02:11:48.580 --> 02:11:49.580
At least the one other show we have right now.

02:11:49.580 --> 02:11:50.580
One other show.

02:11:50.580 --> 02:11:56.340
On Tuesdays, pre-show starting at a quarter to seven, show starting at seven thirty.

02:11:56.340 --> 02:11:59.100
That's Pacific time for everybody else.

02:11:59.100 --> 02:12:03.020
We have Pump Up the Volume, which is a music request show in theory, although I pretty

02:12:03.020 --> 02:12:06.900
much just submit, you know, everybody the whatever I want to play for them.

02:12:06.900 --> 02:12:09.660
It goes on to about ten thirty.

02:12:09.660 --> 02:12:13.860
And I'd like to catch everybody up on This Week in Max Remixes.

02:12:14.860 --> 02:12:34.660
Starting with Maximum, with three X's, by mochi13, we have Max300, the MSG remix, by fearofthedragon, Requiem for Max, Max100, MaxTakedown, MaxRelord...

02:12:34.660 --> 02:12:37.780
Why re-lord? What the hell? That doesn't make any sense.

02:12:37.780 --> 02:12:41.700
Re-lord, okay, max cremation, max dominator.

02:12:41.700 --> 02:12:46.500
Ummm, zephyr, max speedmix,

02:12:46.500 --> 02:12:51.900
max frances, and max 300 period, max hold.

02:12:51.900 --> 02:12:55.540
Stop.

02:12:55.540 --> 02:13:01.660
Just, just stop people. But there's one though, I swear.

02:13:01.660 --> 02:13:07.900
And I know it's one I downloaded just to check it out. Let's see what it was.

02:13:07.900 --> 02:13:13.840
Max Takedown. And they say that the friend says,

02:13:13.840 --> 02:13:18.300
This is a version of Max that my friend Explicit made.

02:13:18.300 --> 02:13:21.020
What the hell?

02:13:21.020 --> 02:13:24.280
Wow.

02:13:24.280 --> 02:13:29.060
Wow. Just wow. There's only one Explicit.

02:13:29.060 --> 02:13:31.800
The one and only, I guess. With three X's, or what?

02:13:31.800 --> 02:13:36.260
Yeah, three X's. And it's with a Z, not a C.

02:13:36.260 --> 02:13:39.260
Which is interesting, I gotta check this out.

02:13:39.260 --> 02:13:42.560
In a way, just because I'm curious.

02:13:42.560 --> 02:13:45.700
But now, but then, speaking of that, something brought up the idea of

02:13:45.700 --> 02:13:49.460
The Legend of Vertex.

02:13:49.460 --> 02:13:53.460
Because they try to fuse In the Groove and DDR together, so that

02:13:53.460 --> 02:13:57.740
they come up with this. Actually, I found this great new remix of Max recently.

02:13:57.740 --> 02:13:59.740
It's a really good max mix.

02:14:01.740 --> 02:14:03.740
This is a good max mix, huh?

02:14:03.740 --> 02:14:05.740
Oh wait, I'm just kidding. That's Energizer from In the Group 2.

02:14:07.740 --> 02:14:09.740
That joke never gets old.

02:14:09.740 --> 02:14:11.740
Alright.

02:14:13.740 --> 02:14:15.740
Let's go to the cage match winner, shall we?

02:14:15.740 --> 02:14:17.740
You want to know who won tonight's cage match?

02:14:17.740 --> 02:14:19.740
You can't handle who won tonight's cage match!

02:14:19.740 --> 02:14:21.740
Why not?

02:14:21.740 --> 02:14:23.740
Alright, the winner in tonight's cage match.

02:14:23.740 --> 02:14:25.740
Very, very close.

02:14:25.740 --> 02:14:32.740
battle tonight, but in the end, one song squeaked by to win it, and it's the song from BustaMove.

02:14:32.740 --> 02:14:43.100
Who knew that there were so many fanboys and fangirls in there for BustaMove? Very, very

02:14:43.100 --> 02:14:47.980
close with the Royscoff song, though. Very, very close. Which is unusual for my song to

02:14:47.980 --> 02:14:52.700
get that many votes, so. Damn you, Dark Sakura. Damn you to heck.

02:14:52.700 --> 02:14:53.700
It never sounds better.

02:14:53.700 --> 02:14:54.700
I know.

02:14:54.700 --> 02:14:55.700
It's all right.

02:14:55.700 --> 02:15:01.060
I won't take it personally.

02:15:01.060 --> 02:15:02.060
Let's go to a break, shall we?

02:15:02.060 --> 02:15:03.060
I promised a break.

02:15:03.060 --> 02:15:04.060
Hi.

02:15:04.060 --> 02:15:05.060
Can we break things?

02:15:05.060 --> 02:15:07.220
I unlocked the first picture in this wonderful game I'm playing.

02:15:07.220 --> 02:15:08.220
That this is the one.

02:15:08.220 --> 02:15:09.220
I'm playing Gals Panic.

02:15:09.220 --> 02:15:10.340
No, I'm not playing Gals Panic.

02:15:10.340 --> 02:15:14.660
I'm playing Peek-a-boo-pooker for the NES, one of the few adult games.

02:15:14.660 --> 02:15:15.660
Is that like Bubble Bath Babes?

02:15:15.660 --> 02:15:17.660
Made by the same company.

02:15:17.660 --> 02:15:21.620
Anyways, it says, hi, I'm Full House Francine.

02:15:21.620 --> 02:15:26.420
Are you feeling lucky tonight? Want to fill up my house?

02:15:26.420 --> 02:15:29.280
And this is like the worst graphics in the world.

02:15:29.280 --> 02:15:32.140
This is what they need to be coming after.

02:15:32.140 --> 02:15:37.580
These really sick games for the Nintendo Entertainment System.

02:15:37.580 --> 02:15:38.580
Bad Nintendo.

02:15:38.580 --> 02:15:39.580
Alright.

02:15:39.580 --> 02:15:44.500
We're going to go to a break, you guys, and this song here, we're going to start it off

02:15:44.500 --> 02:15:45.900
with a special dedication.

02:15:45.900 --> 02:15:51.580
This is Let's Groove from DDR Max, and Ron Chan wanted to hear this one, so we're dedicating

02:15:51.580 --> 02:15:58.580
it to him. And here it is. Enjoy.

02:16:51.580 --> 02:16:57.580
Alright, let's just go

02:16:57.580 --> 02:17:02.580
Stand up, stand up, stand up, alright

02:17:02.580 --> 02:17:05.580
Let's just go, how do we do

02:17:05.580 --> 02:17:09.580
Alright, alright, alright

02:17:09.580 --> 02:17:12.580
Let's just go, stay in shoes

02:17:12.580 --> 02:17:17.580
We should stand up alright, alright

02:18:12.580 --> 02:18:14.580
Oh

02:18:42.580 --> 02:19:10.580
I just know it's real Don't you want to see it again?

02:19:10.580 --> 02:19:16.580
I'm going to go back into reality

02:19:16.580 --> 02:19:20.580
I'm very jealous of this statistic

02:19:20.580 --> 02:19:24.580
I've decided to let it go

02:19:24.580 --> 02:19:30.580
I've decided to let it go

02:21:30.580 --> 02:21:59.580
I want to live, I want to live, I want to live the way I've been on and on for a long, long time.

02:22:29.580 --> 02:22:38.580
No matter how far I go, I'll be your friend on every day.

02:22:38.580 --> 02:22:41.580
I'll be your friend.

02:22:41.580 --> 02:22:58.980
Mr. Random Person on the Street, who by the way is not an actor, what do you think of

02:22:58.980 --> 02:23:01.260
the Orange Drowned Spam on a music and more show?

02:23:01.260 --> 02:23:08.820
The music is like being transported to just this dancing spaceship place.

02:23:08.820 --> 02:23:11.060
It's unearthly.

02:23:11.060 --> 02:23:14.980
like being in a club except you don't have to, you know, actually ask someone to dance.

02:23:14.980 --> 02:23:19.380
Hi, we're back here on Orange Lounge Radio. We're going to get into the FUs of the week very soon so

02:23:19.380 --> 02:23:24.020
you kids might want to start sending in your angst over private message and we'll get to those. Try

02:23:24.020 --> 02:23:27.140
to keep them short tonight though because there's a lot of active people participating in the show

02:23:27.140 --> 02:23:31.380
now. We had a lot of cage match votes tonight so that means that the FUs are going to need to be

02:23:31.380 --> 02:23:35.140
somewhat short so if you send me a long one I'm going to cut it up. Jonas, that goes double for

02:23:35.140 --> 02:23:39.140
you. I know you haven't been here in a while. I know you got some stored up. Are you going to cut

02:23:39.140 --> 02:23:43.420
cut it up like they cut me up in the interview? Yes, I will cut you up just like they cut

02:23:43.420 --> 02:23:47.700
up Loki's interview. Remember, I cut myself in with two beats of titties. Alright, yeah,

02:23:47.700 --> 02:23:53.220
that's right. Alright, moving on. First, before we get to the FUs of the Week, though, Loki

02:23:53.220 --> 02:23:56.440
wanted me to talk about this because he's like, Rob, you have to talk about this story

02:23:56.440 --> 02:24:02.420
I posted, so fine. DJ Maxx, it's his Korean online rhythm music game and it's going to

02:24:02.420 --> 02:24:07.380
be coming out for the PSP. Tell us a little more about DJ Maxx, Loki. DJ Maxx was by the

02:24:07.380 --> 02:24:12.740
The creators of Easy to DJ, those may not remember, Easy to DJ was the actual competitor

02:24:12.740 --> 02:24:14.720
for Beatmania out there.

02:24:14.720 --> 02:24:20.260
It was five key with turntables, kind of set up like Beatmania 2DX where the turntables

02:24:20.260 --> 02:24:21.680
are on the outside.

02:24:21.680 --> 02:24:24.880
Also had foot pedals on it, just like Beatmania 3.

02:24:24.880 --> 02:24:30.780
So this game's coming out now, DJ Maxx, it's only five key, I believe it's only five key

02:24:30.780 --> 02:24:36.320
and no turntable, no actually I take that back, seven key, no turntable.

02:24:36.320 --> 02:24:41.080
But the songs are awesome, they're by the same artist that we're in, Easy to DJ, and

02:24:41.080 --> 02:24:42.400
the quality is just really good.

02:24:42.400 --> 02:24:46.840
It's an online game right now, but it is coming, well they have a cell phone version I guess,

02:24:46.840 --> 02:24:49.180
but this one's coming to the PSP.

02:24:49.180 --> 02:24:53.520
Is it going to suck as much as like Beatmania on Game Boy?

02:24:53.520 --> 02:24:54.520
I don't think so.

02:24:54.520 --> 02:24:58.940
I think the way they can do it, because it's just five key presses, so I'm sure they can

02:24:58.940 --> 02:25:02.820
map it out in some way that'll make sense.

02:25:02.820 --> 02:25:05.880
They should do the type of thing where you can turn it like on its side, so you can see

02:25:05.880 --> 02:25:07.880
the notes coming down better. That would be kind of neat.

02:25:07.880 --> 02:25:10.880
They did that on Wonderswan. See, that would be cool.

02:25:10.880 --> 02:25:13.880
They might be. It doesn't look like the way they set it up because it's going to be set

02:25:13.880 --> 02:25:18.880
up with your play field on the left-hand side of the screen and video on the right.

02:25:18.880 --> 02:25:23.880
So, I think what they could do, though, is have add-on peripherals for it because by

02:25:23.880 --> 02:25:27.880
that time, I'm sure they will already have the PSP keyboard because that's going to be

02:25:27.880 --> 02:25:32.880
coming out with version 2.0 of the firmware, which is, what, next week.

02:25:32.880 --> 02:25:37.680
Is that the white PSP coming out at that same time too?

02:25:37.680 --> 02:25:39.320
No, the white PSP is coming out in September.

02:25:39.320 --> 02:25:41.520
It will be built in with firmware 2.0.

02:25:41.520 --> 02:25:46.880
Didn't you say you were going to buy two just so you could have your old emulator PSP?

02:25:46.880 --> 02:25:52.160
Yeah, I wanted to buy two just because of that, because I'm curious to see what I want

02:25:52.160 --> 02:25:57.120
to do is if the PSP looks like it can download files, and if it can download audio files,

02:25:57.120 --> 02:25:58.760
it can download our podcast.

02:25:58.760 --> 02:26:01.960
If it can download our podcast, I'm going to make a PSP page where you can download

02:26:01.960 --> 02:26:06.720
The podcast will be formatted for the PSP and whatnot, special content, that type of thing.

02:26:06.720 --> 02:26:08.400
Interesting.

02:26:08.400 --> 02:26:10.600
So, but this looks really cool.

02:26:10.600 --> 02:26:14.480
First, like, rhythm music game that I think is coming, well, unless you count Luminous,

02:26:14.480 --> 02:26:17.220
but that's not really a rhythm music game.

02:26:17.220 --> 02:26:18.320
It's more of a puzzle game.

02:26:18.320 --> 02:26:22.720
But this is going to be coming out, no word on yet what's coming over here.

02:26:22.720 --> 02:26:28.400
If it's coming out over here, you know, in Korea, though, and they've announced it on their website,

02:26:28.400 --> 02:26:30.000
so we'll just have to wait.

02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:33.520
but looks cool so far from the video I've seen.

02:26:33.520 --> 02:26:35.520
Alrighty.

02:26:35.520 --> 02:26:39.160
Let's get into the FUs of the week. It's our chance to get a little bit

02:26:39.160 --> 02:26:42.560
angry because we have a lot of anger built up inside ourselves, as you saw

02:26:42.560 --> 02:26:44.200
Loki earlier in the program.

02:26:44.200 --> 02:26:46.960
Um, alright.

02:26:46.960 --> 02:26:48.420
DarkSakura,

02:26:48.420 --> 02:26:51.640
this is all happening because of you. This was all your idea, your

02:26:51.640 --> 02:26:54.700
your big evil empire that you've built since episode one.

02:26:54.700 --> 02:26:58.560
Why is it that we have to do these FUs of the week every single week?

02:26:58.560 --> 02:27:05.560
go

02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:09.920
humongous

02:27:09.920 --> 02:27:14.600
at the ages

02:27:14.600 --> 02:27:16.440
per step you that microphone

02:27:16.440 --> 02:27:17.660
fucking up again

02:27:17.660 --> 02:27:23.360
what the horse after a place to dampen contract net what about my plan i bought

02:27:23.360 --> 02:27:24.720
we could always sub that in

02:27:24.720 --> 02:27:26.660
yeah i will have a look

02:27:26.660 --> 02:27:28.460
It's right there behind you.

02:27:28.460 --> 02:27:30.020
Is it plugged in?

02:27:30.020 --> 02:27:32.820
No, I can just take the top off of it.

02:27:32.820 --> 02:27:35.100
First you have to go through technical difficulties.

02:27:35.100 --> 02:27:41.520
Hold on a sec.

02:27:41.520 --> 02:27:44.000
There we go. Much better.

02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:47.860
Bye bye, piece of shit microphone!

02:27:47.860 --> 02:27:52.060
Anyway, F you to the microphone. F you to work.

02:27:52.060 --> 02:27:54.600
Specifically, and now keep in mind,

02:27:54.600 --> 02:28:06.360
I bore my co-workers, my boss is pretty cool, but just a good manager should not let their

02:28:06.360 --> 02:28:10.320
stress bleed onto their employees, right?

02:28:10.320 --> 02:28:13.680
That's been happening.

02:28:13.680 --> 02:28:16.800
And I have been getting all stressed out at work, and it's not good if I get all stressed

02:28:16.800 --> 02:28:17.800
out.

02:28:17.800 --> 02:28:21.800
Thursday I went home sick with a combination of fatigue, low blood sugar, and a pretty

02:28:21.800 --> 02:28:24.360
high level of stress.

02:28:24.360 --> 02:28:30.480
I ended up having a venti green tea frappuccino, which I finished in twice the time Dan finished

02:28:30.480 --> 02:28:35.920
his, and I still let down at 9 o'clock and didn't wake up until 2, when he came home

02:28:35.920 --> 02:28:41.400
with his new car, which is a model up to mine and brand new, but my car still looks better.

02:28:41.400 --> 02:28:42.400
I digress.

02:28:42.400 --> 02:28:49.280
That's really it, really it, and also, oh yeah, as to how expensive the furniture we

02:28:49.280 --> 02:28:51.320
want is, okay I'm done.

02:28:51.320 --> 02:28:56.320
Alright, let's move on to Loki's FUs of the Week.

02:28:56.320 --> 02:28:59.320
Yeah, uh, it's so fun.

02:28:59.320 --> 02:29:02.320
Um, the first FUs of the Week goes to KCRA3.

02:29:02.320 --> 02:29:09.320
Okay, now, I have to preface this with, um, the fact Brian, the interviewer, alright, he was great.

02:29:09.320 --> 02:29:12.320
Okay, the reporter was awesome, the cameraman was awesome.

02:29:12.320 --> 02:29:16.320
Just whoever edited the damn thing, not awesome, okay?

02:29:16.320 --> 02:29:20.320
They really need to learn we're better than heat, okay?

02:29:20.320 --> 02:29:26.440
okay so no plug they fucking suck for that and the fact that they cut this

02:29:26.440 --> 02:29:30.720
like really stupid clip of me talking saying it's so fun you know don't even

02:29:30.720 --> 02:29:35.180
put me in it at all okay cuz at least I don't look like a fucking idiot thank

02:29:35.180 --> 02:29:40.320
you very much I'm definitely gonna have some written contract for the next

02:29:40.320 --> 02:29:46.440
person interviews us there's gonna be some serious issues huh anyways so fuck

02:29:46.440 --> 02:29:51.760
you to that. Fuck you stupid people that are driving too damn slow, especially people from

02:29:51.760 --> 02:29:57.760
Arizona. Like this woman today, uh, it was like, I don't even remember what it was, it

02:29:57.760 --> 02:30:04.520
was like, like, old, old toot or something like that, is what the license plate said.

02:30:04.520 --> 02:30:11.240
It was just like, you know, old fart or something, old toot, you know, I'm like, okay, so I think

02:30:11.240 --> 02:30:15.360
it was actually this old guy. When we drove by him, the guy looked like he was a corpse

02:30:15.360 --> 02:30:45.240
This is what you do, you tell them it's a health hazard.

02:30:45.240 --> 02:30:47.240
They'll be on it fast!

02:31:15.240 --> 02:31:44.240
I'd like to give an F you to 12 hour work days like the one I had on Friday. That kind of sucks because I came home and I napped for a long time and then I was ended up staying up to like four in the morning because my sleep schedule was just all screwed up. So, but don't get me wrong. I love my job. Just I could do without the 12 hour work days. If I could do my job eight hours evenly every day, I'd be fine. So if I could do my job eight hours, I'd be fine.

02:31:44.240 --> 02:31:48.240
So, oh well, I guess it comes with the territory.

02:31:48.240 --> 02:31:52.240
And F.U. to the fact that I have to travel soon, because I'm going to miss being here

02:31:52.240 --> 02:31:56.240
for two weeks, and it's just going to, it makes it hard to do a podcast

02:31:56.240 --> 02:32:00.240
every single week when I'm not going to be here and trying to do a three hour show

02:32:00.240 --> 02:32:04.240
as well, you know, I'd like to be here for that. So, general angst

02:32:04.240 --> 02:32:08.240
to leaving and then going to an area that's going to be, you know,

02:32:08.240 --> 02:32:12.240
it's not like I'm going to Disneyland, people.

02:32:12.240 --> 02:32:18.800
oh well, it comes with the territory. Um, and then, um, an F you to the fact that when

02:32:18.800 --> 02:32:23.120
I tried to play 2DX 6 style and 3rd style earlier this week, they wouldn't work with

02:32:23.120 --> 02:32:26.240
my component cables for some reason. I can't figure out if that's a resolution thing or

02:32:26.240 --> 02:32:30.200
what the hell is going on. So F you to me being a technological idiot when it comes

02:32:30.200 --> 02:32:36.080
to the new TV. But otherwise, um, I love my new TV. It's so pretty. Um, oh, and F you

02:32:36.080 --> 02:32:42.600
to how bad I suck at Halo 2. That's all. Moving on to the one and only explicit. Alright,

02:32:42.600 --> 02:32:48.920
I'll keep it quick and quick summaries, alright? FU to the whole adults only for GTA, like

02:32:48.920 --> 02:32:54.280
everybody already mentioned a while ago, and the fact that the ESRB is gonna kill sales

02:32:54.280 --> 02:33:01.280
for all those M or AO games. Look what you did. And FU goes to the neighbors for blaming

02:33:01.280 --> 02:33:06.720
neighbors for blaming us for killing their plants over water issues. First of all, we

02:33:06.720 --> 02:33:12.200
didn't spill any water or leak any water out of nowhere. Second of all, is it even our

02:33:12.200 --> 02:33:19.200
house that was leaking water? And if he goes to the spot being broken still, I still get

02:33:19.440 --> 02:33:26.440
a hot tub massage. And if he goes to my tail bump being all fucked up, I gotta check on

02:33:26.440 --> 02:33:28.440
I gotta go check on the doctor for that one.

02:33:29.440 --> 02:33:32.440
And Epic goes to Manfay on Anime Expo.

02:33:33.440 --> 02:33:35.440
Oh my god, Manfay is back?

02:33:35.440 --> 02:33:37.440
Yes, he is back.

02:33:37.440 --> 02:33:41.440
I saw Manfay at FanaMe a few years ago.

02:33:42.440 --> 02:33:46.440
A guy who cosplays as Faye, and he's really hairy.

02:33:47.440 --> 02:33:52.440
And I don't mean hairy as in scary, although yeah he is scary, but I mean hairy as in covered in fur like a bear.

02:33:52.440 --> 02:33:53.440
fair.

02:33:53.440 --> 02:33:59.520
Surprisingly, he didn't get arrested, but he's banned from Anime Expo, but he's almost

02:33:59.520 --> 02:34:06.200
mooned and stuck his ass up with my friend who tried to tag on his shoe.

02:34:06.200 --> 02:34:15.200
I've only ever once seen good cosplay as in a guy cosplaying a girl, and that was a really

02:34:15.200 --> 02:34:19.560
pretty pretty guy cosplaying Utena from the movie.

02:34:19.560 --> 02:34:20.960
A pretty guy.

02:34:20.960 --> 02:34:22.960
a really pretty guy.

02:34:50.960 --> 02:34:54.960
Who's to blame here?

02:34:54.960 --> 02:35:02.960
Uh, let's see. In Fv2, stupid little kid just stepped on my foot.

02:35:02.960 --> 02:35:05.960
It might be really this big.

02:35:05.960 --> 02:35:07.960
And...

02:35:07.960 --> 02:35:10.960
I'm not gonna make a comment.

02:35:10.960 --> 02:35:14.960
And, because I want to make sure I don't get cut off, I'll say do be continuous.

02:35:14.960 --> 02:35:16.960
Actually, one more, there's one more.

02:35:16.960 --> 02:35:22.960
Uh, and if, a big, a big, if it goes to the whole tournament drama that was leading to the, to the pit tournament.

02:35:22.960 --> 02:35:26.960
Oh yeah, you wanted to ban some guy, that didn't make me happy.

02:35:26.960 --> 02:35:32.960
I was, yeah, I couldn't, even though I couldn't, in a, in a bad way, it damaged my reputation in a way.

02:35:32.960 --> 02:35:35.960
Well not you, don't take it personally, it's not you, it's the other guy.

02:35:35.960 --> 02:35:38.960
He needs to go out, he needs to be publicly spanked.

02:35:39.960 --> 02:35:40.960
He might like that though.

02:35:40.960 --> 02:35:45.960
I wonder what's going to happen in the tournament. That's all I want to know.

02:35:45.960 --> 02:35:48.960
You know I got to back Toady up, no matter what happens.

02:35:48.960 --> 02:35:52.960
I know the band decision was uncalled for.

02:35:52.960 --> 02:35:55.960
That's why I put everything up to make sure in a peaceful manner.

02:35:55.960 --> 02:35:56.960
Drama!

02:35:56.960 --> 02:35:58.960
Alright. It's cool. It'll be cool.

02:35:58.960 --> 02:36:01.960
Alright, let's move on to the chatroom FUs, shall we?

02:36:01.960 --> 02:36:06.960
And somebody said that this song is so horrid that I had to use this as the background music.

02:36:06.960 --> 02:36:14.960
Let's say Misty wants to say an F.U. to the USB reader on the In the Groove 2, not responding to my card or any other card that was tried.

02:36:14.960 --> 02:36:17.960
Hope it's a problem that can be fixed with just a reboot.

02:36:17.960 --> 02:36:23.960
Sakarina says F.U. to the retard who let my 9 year old brother play Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.

02:36:23.960 --> 02:36:32.960
Acer800 says F.U. to the AC not working for a month and my mom getting mad at me for listening to the F.U.s last week.

02:36:32.960 --> 02:36:38.320
it's not a children's program not saying you're a child but that's only just buy

02:36:38.320 --> 02:36:45.360
headphones okay if you're gonna listen to our naughty language also we have

02:36:45.360 --> 02:36:49.840
Reznor says a nice fuck you to come shots being more risque than shooting

02:36:49.840 --> 02:36:53.480
someone in the ass with a hand cannon

02:36:53.920 --> 02:36:59.000
Sakura sin says f you to Nintendo for not making any good puzzle games lately

02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:01.000
to keep me busy.

02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:02.400
Hello, did you play Meteos?

02:37:02.400 --> 02:37:03.900
Well, I realize Nintendo didn't make that,

02:37:03.900 --> 02:37:05.240
but Meteos is very cool.

02:37:05.240 --> 02:37:07.000
I've gotta recommend that.

02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:09.820
Illusion says, F you to cutting my gums a few minutes ago,

02:37:09.820 --> 02:37:11.080
and now they're bleeding.

02:37:12.080 --> 02:37:15.120
And Ron Chan says, F you to the post office.

02:37:15.120 --> 02:37:17.240
It was supposed to come Friday,

02:37:17.240 --> 02:37:18.880
but it came Saturday and I had left.

02:37:18.880 --> 02:37:19.720
Fuck you.

02:37:19.720 --> 02:37:22.560
Oh, and F you to me running out of space on my hard drive.

02:37:24.640 --> 02:37:27.480
That's it for our angsty chat room F yous.

02:37:27.480 --> 02:37:29.320
Yay, all right.

02:37:29.320 --> 02:37:30.680
I wasn't even inked enough, but OK.

02:37:30.680 --> 02:37:35.800
No, it was kind of light on the angst tonight.

02:37:35.800 --> 02:37:37.840
It was angst light, diet angst tonight.

02:37:37.840 --> 02:37:39.440
That's all right.

02:37:39.440 --> 02:37:41.520
OK, what we're going to do now, I

02:37:41.520 --> 02:37:46.680
think we're going to go ahead and go to another break.

02:37:46.680 --> 02:37:48.800
Doo doo doo doo doo.

02:37:48.800 --> 02:37:50.560
We'll make this a quick break.

02:37:50.560 --> 02:37:51.520
Someone wanted to hear.

02:37:51.520 --> 02:37:53.040
There were some songs that folks wanted to hear,

02:37:53.040 --> 02:37:55.180
and I've already forgot what some of them were.

02:37:55.180 --> 02:37:56.640
I think someone wanted to hear System Romance.

02:37:56.640 --> 02:38:00.480
So I'm going to get to System Romance, uh, and I'll get into another song that somebody

02:38:00.480 --> 02:38:01.480
else wanted to hear.

02:38:01.480 --> 02:38:02.480
Mmm.

02:38:02.480 --> 02:38:03.480
What?

02:38:03.480 --> 02:38:04.480
Last Message.

02:38:04.480 --> 02:38:07.880
You want to hear Last Me- Fine, we'll get to Last Message.

02:38:07.880 --> 02:38:12.000
We're going to make this a short break, because we're looking for questions for Ask Orange

02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:13.000
Lounge.

02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:16.880
That's right, it's time to Ask Orange Lounge, or tonight you can ask Jonas as well if you

02:38:16.880 --> 02:38:17.880
want to.

02:38:17.880 --> 02:38:20.040
Like, what the hell is that medal that you're wearing around your neck?

02:38:20.040 --> 02:38:21.040
That's what I want to know.

02:38:21.040 --> 02:38:22.520
Do y'all see this, uh, spinner?

02:38:22.520 --> 02:38:23.520
It's a spinner?

02:38:23.520 --> 02:38:27.520
This is what I got from the WWE event. It's the spinner from John Cena.

02:38:27.520 --> 02:38:31.520
Hey, you can't see me. Obfuscate.

02:38:31.520 --> 02:38:35.520
If anyone has ever played live action vampire,

02:38:35.520 --> 02:38:39.520
his little waving his hand in front of his face thing is also the obfuscate action.

02:38:39.520 --> 02:38:43.520
For live action vampire. Oh wow. So, you can't see me.

02:38:43.520 --> 02:38:47.520
Oh, that was the other request. Somebody wanted to hear something from Silent Hills.

02:38:47.520 --> 02:38:51.520
So how about instead we hear some You're Not Here. Is that acceptable to our Sakura?

02:38:51.520 --> 02:38:54.520
Um, okay. Okay.

02:38:54.520 --> 02:38:56.520
You gonna be okay?

02:38:56.520 --> 02:38:58.520
OKAY!

02:38:58.520 --> 02:39:02.520
Alright, so we'll get to that. We'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.

02:41:28.520 --> 02:41:32.520
Oh I hope you're ready to go

02:41:32.520 --> 02:41:35.520
I hope you're ready to go

02:41:35.520 --> 02:41:40.520
I hope you're ready to go

02:41:40.520 --> 02:41:45.520
I hope you're ready to go

02:41:45.520 --> 02:41:48.520
You've got to do it forever

02:41:48.520 --> 02:41:51.520
The grain drops, broken the wind is dead

02:41:51.520 --> 02:41:55.520
And it would be a much better flight

02:41:55.520 --> 02:42:02.520
If you hadn't let me, I'd be fine on my own, baby

02:42:02.520 --> 02:42:08.520
Never felt so lonely then you came along

02:42:08.520 --> 02:42:11.520
So now what should I do?

02:42:11.520 --> 02:42:15.520
I'm strung out, addicted to you

02:42:15.520 --> 02:42:18.520
My body aches, now that you're gone

02:42:18.520 --> 02:42:23.520
My supply fell through

02:42:23.520 --> 02:42:28.520
Glad they gave me everything you had and more

02:42:28.520 --> 02:42:30.520
It craves my happiness

02:42:30.520 --> 02:42:34.520
When you made me feel joy and made you smile

02:42:34.520 --> 02:42:37.520
But now I feel your stress

02:42:37.520 --> 02:42:42.520
Love was never meant to be such a crazy affair, no

02:42:42.520 --> 02:42:44.520
And who has time but you?

02:42:44.520 --> 02:42:50.520
Never thought I'd sit around and unravel your love

02:42:50.520 --> 02:43:04.880
Oh hi, dead air because I forgot to put in a promo there.

02:43:04.880 --> 02:43:05.880
We're back.

02:43:05.880 --> 02:43:10.520
Listen to Orange Laund Radio or we eat your liver.

02:43:10.520 --> 02:43:11.520
There you go.

02:43:11.520 --> 02:43:13.640
There you go, that's a good promo.

02:43:13.640 --> 02:43:14.640
Good enough for me.

02:43:14.640 --> 02:43:18.340
Alright, we're going to get into a little segment now where we let you guys control

02:43:18.340 --> 02:43:23.700
the show and ask us whatever you want within reason though people within

02:43:23.700 --> 02:43:27.300
reason please don't ask about our naughty bits because we're not going to

02:43:27.300 --> 02:43:30.780
talk about those well at least I don't feel like talking about mine but who

02:43:30.780 --> 02:43:33.940
knows who knows what kind of mode we're in all right here we go

02:43:33.940 --> 02:43:43.540
that's going to launch time let's ask orange lounge some stupid question what

02:43:43.540 --> 02:43:48.100
will we find out this week on orange lounge radio what will the court chat

02:43:48.100 --> 02:43:54.100
will it be a g-rated question? I really hope so, because this show's already too much AO.

02:43:54.100 --> 02:43:57.100
Ha, that was cool.

02:44:05.100 --> 02:44:09.100
Ah, da-da-da-da-da-da. Let's see, uh, Tomo-kun wants to know,

02:44:09.100 --> 02:44:16.100
why was 180 mode pissed away on Para-para dancing and not in Para-para paradise?

02:44:16.100 --> 02:44:21.100
I'm assuming that's when you can turn around and do Para Para the other way?

02:44:21.100 --> 02:44:24.100
So people can actually watch you doing the dancing?

02:44:24.100 --> 02:44:27.100
I didn't play enough Para Para to follow that stuff, I have to admit.

02:44:27.100 --> 02:44:30.100
I thought it was cute for like a week, but...

02:44:30.100 --> 02:44:31.100
Do you know anything about that?

02:44:31.100 --> 02:44:32.100
No.

02:44:32.100 --> 02:44:33.100
Oh.

02:44:33.100 --> 02:44:34.100
I don't know.

02:44:34.100 --> 02:44:38.100
You know, sometimes they just take modes out.

02:44:38.100 --> 02:44:41.100
But if you look up, aren't there only sensors on the front part of it?

02:44:41.100 --> 02:44:44.100
Don't they not have sensors on the back part of a Para Para machine?

02:44:44.100 --> 02:44:45.100
I don't remember.

02:44:45.100 --> 02:44:49.060
no they don't but you could probably put one there you can mount it I guess you

02:44:49.060 --> 02:44:54.900
could flip it around if you wanted to but you know oh well sorry don't know

02:44:54.900 --> 02:44:59.820
enough about part part answer your question boy do we suck or what moving

02:44:59.820 --> 02:45:07.420
on you know this question is pretty much setting us up to drop the clip again you

02:45:07.420 --> 02:45:14.060
know that right illusion basically wanted to know what is Loki think of sex

02:45:14.060 --> 02:45:40.980
What song was playing during Exquisite's FUs?

02:45:40.980 --> 02:45:44.380
I think I recognized it, but I'm not sure because I hardly heard it.

02:45:44.380 --> 02:45:50.060
The song that was playing during Explicit's FUs was EVO66 from 2DX Red.

02:45:50.060 --> 02:45:54.060
That's the song we had.

02:45:54.060 --> 02:46:00.060
This is the worst part, there we go, here we go.

02:46:00.060 --> 02:46:06.380
That was the song that was playing, Wall 5, 2DX Red.

02:46:06.380 --> 02:46:08.220
I thought it was an appropriate FU song.

02:46:08.220 --> 02:46:12.620
I didn't even know there was a background where I was assigned to FUs.

02:46:12.620 --> 02:46:15.460
All right, RainbowsInTheNight wants to know,

02:46:15.460 --> 02:46:18.740
how can I fix my metal dance pad from Red Octane?

02:46:18.740 --> 02:46:21.740
Half of the up arrow works, and the back arrow doesn't work at all.

02:46:21.740 --> 02:46:24.900
Red Octane was all like, take it to a TV repairman.

02:46:24.900 --> 02:46:26.460
Problem being, I'm broke.

02:46:26.460 --> 02:46:27.400
Any suggestions?

02:46:27.400 --> 02:46:28.980
I've already disassembled and cleaned it.

02:46:28.980 --> 02:46:30.020
Same problems.

02:46:30.020 --> 02:46:32.940
The closest ER machine is 40 minutes away on an interstate,

02:46:32.940 --> 02:46:34.580
because Virginia's pretty lame.

02:46:34.580 --> 02:46:35.660
Help would be nice.

02:46:35.660 --> 02:46:37.700
Well, Loki, you built your own metal pads before.

02:46:37.700 --> 02:46:42.200
What do you think TV repair man? What the hell? I'm not TV. That's kind of weird back to them

02:46:42.200 --> 02:46:44.580
It's their own fucking pad. They should fix it. I don't know

02:46:45.100 --> 02:46:50.740
Well now how did how did the sensors work in a metal pad at least you get a metal pad depends most likely

02:46:50.740 --> 02:46:52.500
It's just going to be contacts in there

02:46:52.500 --> 02:46:58.580
And if half the up arrow works or whatever probably half the contacts or something broke or something or fell off

02:46:58.580 --> 02:47:04.360
I haven't really looked at their metal pads. I've taken apart crappy metal pads, and that's the way they work, but

02:47:04.360 --> 02:47:09.720
it. I don't know. How long has he had it? Well, we don't know. I can ask how long he's

02:47:09.720 --> 02:47:13.080
had it. I would ask, I mean, honestly, if you buy it from Red Octane, isn't there, like,

02:47:13.080 --> 02:47:17.360
some sort of, like, return policy or something? Yeah, you gotta assume it's past return policy

02:47:17.360 --> 02:47:21.520
time, though, if he's asking this. Oh, he says, out of warranty and yes, contacts. So,

02:47:21.520 --> 02:47:27.360
he's saying, so, my first suggestion would be clean the contacts, and he says he's disassembled

02:47:27.360 --> 02:47:31.360
and cleaned it. So, does that just mean one of his contacts is broken and he's shit out

02:47:31.360 --> 02:47:35.360
It's not necessarily context, it'd be a loose wire or something also.

02:47:35.360 --> 02:47:37.360
Mmm, that's a good thought too.

02:47:37.360 --> 02:47:40.360
What, Jonas? Give him a mic.

02:47:40.360 --> 02:47:43.360
Usually if you clean up the whole thing, it's usually not that case.

02:47:43.360 --> 02:47:47.360
I've seen vendors actually try fixing this.

02:47:47.360 --> 02:47:52.360
You have to check if one of the wires is burnt or anything like that.

02:47:52.360 --> 02:47:56.360
So in what case is he absolutely screwed? How would this guy know if he's just screwed

02:47:56.360 --> 02:47:58.360
and he shouldn't even bother wasting his time?

02:47:58.360 --> 02:48:02.360
Because the shit could have just broke, and that's the sad thing.

02:48:02.360 --> 02:48:07.360
I can't answer that question unless he tells you how long he has it, how many...

02:48:07.360 --> 02:48:09.360
Yeah, it's just Christmas, he says.

02:48:09.360 --> 02:48:12.360
And how many times have you been playing the game, like how many songs?

02:48:12.360 --> 02:48:16.360
Well, you can assume if there's no DDR machine nearby, it's probably quite a bit.

02:48:16.360 --> 02:48:20.360
Because, yeah, all I can say is that the paths don't last that long.

02:48:20.360 --> 02:48:26.360
I guess the best answer we can come up with is that it sounds like you already kind of have an idea how to fix this thing

02:48:26.360 --> 02:48:29.240
thing because you've opened it up and you've cleaned it so it's probably not a

02:48:29.240 --> 02:48:33.120
whole lot else we could tell you except take a look at the wiring and make sure

02:48:33.120 --> 02:48:37.160
you don't have any loose connections going from the contacts to the actual

02:48:37.160 --> 02:48:42.200
like what do they call that where they all the it all comes together towards

02:48:42.200 --> 02:48:47.160
the top whatever but check your wiring and but if a wire has shorted or burned

02:48:47.160 --> 02:48:51.080
out is really not a whole lot short of replacing the wire that you're going to

02:48:51.080 --> 02:48:54.360
be able to do which is something you probably don't want to try doing

02:48:54.360 --> 02:48:55.360
yourself.

02:48:55.360 --> 02:48:58.600
Yeah, you don't want to waste too much time on it, but usually it's just to get a new

02:48:58.600 --> 02:49:02.480
pad because it's basically worn out. Wait, what games have you been playing, though?

02:49:02.480 --> 02:49:04.120
Well, assuming it's DDR or some...

02:49:04.120 --> 02:49:08.600
You mean, like, it's DDR and In the Groove as well, that use the same pads?

02:49:08.600 --> 02:49:09.600
Well, but it wouldn't matter.

02:49:09.600 --> 02:49:11.600
Yeah, I can understand if In the Groove ruined those pads.

02:49:11.600 --> 02:49:12.600
Stop it.

02:49:12.600 --> 02:49:14.600
It's such a horrible game. It's like, I can't take it.

02:49:14.600 --> 02:49:19.040
Stop it. He says he plays every day about three to four hours a day on heavy mode, so

02:49:19.040 --> 02:49:22.360
I think you've probably just beat that pad to death.

02:49:22.360 --> 02:49:25.800
the sad thing is those red octane pads don't last forever

02:49:25.800 --> 02:49:30.280
well I mean honestly if it's just like a metal pad or something

02:49:30.280 --> 02:49:33.920
the contacts in it, I'm sure there's ways that you can mod them and upgrade them

02:49:33.920 --> 02:49:35.640
just there's a whole thread on

02:49:35.640 --> 02:49:39.880
DDR Freak about modding, fixing, doing stuff to your metal pads

02:49:39.880 --> 02:49:43.580
just go there. Take a look there, ask a question there, see if they can help you

02:49:43.580 --> 02:49:44.520
over on the Freak

02:49:44.520 --> 02:49:48.760
otherwise make red octane give you a better answer because that's a shitty

02:49:48.760 --> 02:49:50.960
answer they gave you so you should email them again

02:49:50.960 --> 02:49:54.080
And tell them the people on the radio said that they gave you a shitty answer.

02:49:54.080 --> 02:49:57.360
Get that person fired. I can't say that, really.

02:49:57.360 --> 02:50:00.400
That's the best thing that we can give you guys. Sorry.

02:50:00.400 --> 02:50:04.400
Alright. Acer800 wants to know

02:50:04.400 --> 02:50:09.600
who would win in an actual cage match? Loki, Dark Sakura, or me, Sky?

02:50:09.600 --> 02:50:14.280
Good question. Dark Sakura, who would win in an actual cage match between the three of us?

02:50:14.280 --> 02:50:18.320
I would. Why? Because I exercise regularly, lift weights,

02:50:18.320 --> 02:50:21.960
And I've taken karate.

02:50:21.960 --> 02:50:28.160
I've got that killing urge. Yeah, but that's when you need to be sloppy and make mistakes.

02:50:28.160 --> 02:50:32.160
I've got a lot of smarts up here. I could... I'd make you two...

02:50:32.160 --> 02:50:36.680
See, I would make Loki and Dark Sakura beat up on each other while I just kinda watch.

02:50:36.680 --> 02:50:40.520
No. And then that way I save my strength. I'd use you as a bludgeoning tool.

02:50:40.520 --> 02:50:43.520
Yeah, we'll see about that one.

02:50:43.520 --> 02:50:47.960
Honestly, Ace800? That was kinda fun. We would not know the answer to that one

02:50:47.960 --> 02:50:58.960
unless we actually tried it, which maybe we'll do one of these days, as a ratings stunt.

02:50:58.960 --> 02:51:07.800
Reznor wants to know, what's the status on the old school show?

02:51:07.800 --> 02:51:10.520
The old school show was supposed to launch a couple weeks ago, and I'm really sorry it

02:51:10.520 --> 02:51:11.520
hasn't happened yet.

02:51:11.520 --> 02:51:16.440
A decision was made on the staff that we want to make it not just 8-bit music, but 16-bit

02:51:16.440 --> 02:51:20.500
16-bit music as well, and I've just been so freaking busy that I haven't had the time

02:51:20.500 --> 02:51:26.780
to update the 16-bit music as well, so I'm going to try and get on that this week, because,

02:51:26.780 --> 02:51:32.340
yeah, so I will, I'll keep you posted on that. I definitely want it to happen before summer's

02:51:32.340 --> 02:51:36.700
over, hopefully before August gets here, so I will work just for you on the 16-bit stuff

02:51:36.700 --> 02:51:43.360
this week, okay? Promise. Alright, moving on.

02:51:43.360 --> 02:51:47.360
sakarina wants to know can you make an mp3 of that ask orange lounge song

02:51:47.360 --> 02:51:52.560
actually it's a song called journey to the wonderland by and pb and it's in

02:51:52.560 --> 02:51:53.920
keyboard mania too

02:51:53.920 --> 02:51:58.680
if you want a clip of me actually singing it

02:51:58.680 --> 02:52:01.120
uh... asap every week is different

02:52:01.120 --> 02:52:04.480
and uh... bumblebee disguise we fix

02:52:04.480 --> 02:52:06.360
oh my god that's all

02:52:06.360 --> 02:52:09.160
i think i played it like a couple weeks ago

02:52:09.160 --> 02:52:10.240
very very old

02:52:10.240 --> 02:52:12.800
You actually played it on your show?

02:52:12.800 --> 02:52:18.200
Several times. Bitch.

02:52:18.200 --> 02:52:21.680
And Sakarina also wants to know if we could play the actual Silent Hill because I

02:52:21.680 --> 02:52:24.800
fucked up last break. He wanted to hear the actual song Silent Hill

02:52:24.800 --> 02:52:27.960
and not the um... a song from Silent Hill.

02:52:27.960 --> 02:52:28.840
So my bad.

02:52:28.840 --> 02:52:35.840
Uh... here's... we're running out of time on the show so here's a clip.

02:52:35.840 --> 02:52:45.580
All right, that's all you get. Sorry. We're already short on time.

02:52:45.580 --> 02:52:49.780
Tomokun wanted to make a point just to follow up. Yes, ParaParadancer did have sensors on

02:52:49.780 --> 02:52:57.660
the back as well. Well, that's why ParaParadise didn't have the 180MO, because they didn't

02:52:57.660 --> 02:53:05.260
have sensors on the back. Probably a cost-cutting thing, honestly. That's my best answer.

02:53:05.260 --> 02:53:10.660
Neodude wants to know, what do you guys think about the Konami Red Octane Rock Sword Mad

02:53:10.660 --> 02:53:11.660
Cats lawsuit?

02:53:11.660 --> 02:53:13.900
Didn't we talk about that a few weeks ago?

02:53:13.900 --> 02:53:16.420
We kind of did talk about it a few weeks ago on the show.

02:53:16.420 --> 02:53:19.220
I'm going to assume that we've got a new listener on our hands, which is cool.

02:53:19.220 --> 02:53:20.540
Hi, welcome to the show.

02:53:20.540 --> 02:53:22.800
Hope you enjoy.

02:53:22.800 --> 02:53:28.220
But there have been a few recent developments, and the chat can sometimes sway your mind.

02:53:28.220 --> 02:53:29.220
What do you think?

02:53:29.220 --> 02:53:30.780
Loki, what's your latest perspective on this?

02:53:30.780 --> 02:53:32.820
Although I already know what you're going to say.

02:53:32.820 --> 02:53:36.600
latest perspective on this is you know Konami's within their rights you know

02:53:36.600 --> 02:53:40.380
through this because you know these companies are making you know crappy

02:53:40.380 --> 02:53:44.800
games and well not necessarily crappy games they're they're making games

02:53:44.800 --> 02:53:50.160
obviously are too much like DDR I mean they're just trying to like kind of get

02:53:50.160 --> 02:53:54.840
people like oh hey you like DDR then you'll like this almost like DDR game

02:53:54.840 --> 02:54:00.780
and you know when it comes down to it it's just an inferior product just like

02:54:00.780 --> 02:54:07.240
those Apple products and um... Hey! You know that they were having a huge debate in the

02:54:07.240 --> 02:54:11.560
chat room before this started and it simmered down and I was hoping they would shut up already

02:54:11.560 --> 02:54:16.580
about the Apple versus PC thing, but no, you had to go in over your big fat mouth and bring

02:54:16.580 --> 02:54:20.100
up the Apple thing again. This is because you don't know how to use it. Exactly. Oh

02:54:20.100 --> 02:54:24.820
that's right. On! Where's your on button? How do I upgrade this thing? Oh that's right,

02:54:24.820 --> 02:54:29.300
it's all built together. Stop it. They, oh, somebody wanted... I've upgraded Macs before.

02:54:29.300 --> 02:54:33.540
wanted me to point out that there is, now I don't have the exact thing, but I'm sure

02:54:33.540 --> 02:54:38.900
somebody will say this, but there is a way you can customize Macs more than you think.

02:54:38.900 --> 02:54:40.900
They were saying this store somewhere.

02:54:40.900 --> 02:54:41.900
No.

02:54:41.900 --> 02:54:49.940
I have opened up Macs before and changed out their memory, changed out the hard drives,

02:54:49.940 --> 02:54:51.700
put in new graphics cards.

02:54:51.700 --> 02:54:55.160
Yeah, you can upgrade a Mac the same way you can a PC.

02:54:55.160 --> 02:54:57.540
No matter what you do, they're still in for you.

02:54:57.540 --> 02:54:59.540
and you're talking out of your ass.

02:54:59.540 --> 02:55:01.540
Can't we just all get along?

02:55:01.540 --> 02:55:02.540
Isn't there room for-

02:55:02.540 --> 02:55:04.540
As soon as he stops talking out of his ass

02:55:04.540 --> 02:55:06.540
and actually talks about something he knows about, maybe.

02:55:06.540 --> 02:55:11.540
Wait, now that we're not on the contrary with Konami, Rockstar, and Red Octane Maggots,

02:55:11.540 --> 02:55:14.540
what would happen with this Neon FM game since-

02:55:15.540 --> 02:55:17.540
It's nothing like DDR, that's why.

02:55:18.540 --> 02:55:19.540
I'll tell you what's-

02:55:19.540 --> 02:55:23.540
That's the only thing I'm thinking about since, you know, like the Konami thing.

02:55:23.540 --> 02:55:28.220
Here's my perspective with it, as long as Neon FM doesn't try to invade the home markets,

02:55:28.220 --> 02:55:29.220
they'll be fine.

02:55:29.220 --> 02:55:31.060
No, I think they're going to be fine anyways because they've been working with actually

02:55:31.060 --> 02:55:34.820
Konami on this, they've actually flown the people in or whatever and have them look at

02:55:34.820 --> 02:55:35.820
the game.

02:55:35.820 --> 02:55:39.080
Hopefully though, hopefully though, they're not just feeding us BS with that.

02:55:39.080 --> 02:55:43.740
Because the In the Groove team said, the In the Groove team said, shut up, we know it's

02:55:43.740 --> 02:55:45.660
legal and now here you go.

02:55:45.660 --> 02:55:50.340
But honestly, looking at the gameplay of this game, it is quite different from, I mean,

02:55:50.340 --> 02:55:56.040
The setup of the pads are different, the gameplay looks different, it's got just really different

02:55:56.040 --> 02:55:57.040
stuff in it.

02:55:57.040 --> 02:56:01.560
So, I don't think that they're going to be really fringing out, whereas, you know, In

02:56:01.560 --> 02:56:05.420
the Groove looks like DDR just with different, you know, shaped arrows.

02:56:05.420 --> 02:56:07.580
I mean, it's pretty much the same damn game.

02:56:07.580 --> 02:56:11.340
And honestly, the Mad Catz game was just a shitty game in general and brought everybody

02:56:11.340 --> 02:56:12.340
down.

02:56:12.340 --> 02:56:13.820
So it just needed a spanking, basically.

02:56:13.820 --> 02:56:18.620
That's the only question I have with, like, what would happen to Neon FM, because everyone's

02:56:18.620 --> 02:56:24.140
saying who is beat mania on feet in but then again I think as long as they

02:56:24.140 --> 02:56:30.300
aren't I think as long as it's different enough from DDR with the foot layout and

02:56:30.300 --> 02:56:33.620
everything in there in-game layout appears to be very different I think

02:56:33.620 --> 02:56:36.940
they'll be okay just like pump it up so okay well but of course you have that

02:56:36.940 --> 02:56:41.340
whole new lawsuit thing but whatever anyway long story short what I believe

02:56:41.340 --> 02:56:44.700
what's going on in this lawsuit in the groove should have never tried to come

02:56:44.700 --> 02:56:47.660
out for the home systems because it awoke the Konami sleeping giant and

02:56:47.660 --> 02:56:51.980
that's what's happening now so that's my thought I really have no comment on that

02:56:51.980 --> 02:56:56.180
that's just something that everyone has no has a personal preference on that so

02:56:56.180 --> 02:57:02.020
all right anyway moving on Ron Chen has one what anime slash a video game

02:57:02.020 --> 02:57:07.340
character would you all cosplay and why dark soccer you actually do cosplay so I

02:57:07.340 --> 02:57:09.500
should start with you I've never actually cosplay a character from

02:57:09.500 --> 02:57:13.780
I've cosplayed a character from a manga.

02:57:13.780 --> 02:57:18.620
I went as Mad Hatter from Sanctuary.

02:57:18.620 --> 02:57:23.220
I've also cosplayed Biken from Guilty Gear X.

02:57:23.220 --> 02:57:29.000
Dan didn't like that because I didn't have anything to hold my boobs up.

02:57:29.000 --> 02:57:33.260
I've cosplayed Jill from Resident Evil.

02:57:33.260 --> 02:57:36.460
I actually still have that costume. I've cosplayed Emmie

02:57:36.460 --> 02:57:39.260
as in 3rd Mix DDR

02:57:39.260 --> 02:57:43.700
uh... who else have I done? Oh yeah, Shorty from Busty Move 2

02:57:43.700 --> 02:57:45.740
uh...

02:57:45.740 --> 02:57:49.040
I really don't know and I've been trying to think of who I would...

02:57:49.040 --> 02:57:50.580
Leona from...

02:57:50.580 --> 02:57:52.540
I've done Leona

02:57:52.540 --> 02:57:56.540
The costume is actually three sizes too big for me now

02:57:56.540 --> 02:57:59.100
I'll take that back, four sizes too big for me now

02:57:59.100 --> 02:58:01.260
so it's officially retired

02:58:01.260 --> 02:58:02.340
uh...

02:58:02.340 --> 02:58:11.320
I was working on doing, uh, uh, Richter Belmont from, uh, Dracula X, but I really, I want

02:58:11.320 --> 02:58:15.600
to do one from an anime, I just don't know who, although it's been suggested to do Hyatt

02:58:15.600 --> 02:58:21.480
from, uh, Exosaga, but I don't want to do that outfit, and I don't want to carry around

02:58:21.480 --> 02:58:23.140
fake blood and cough.

02:58:23.140 --> 02:58:27.720
I witnessed Ash Ketchum one year for Halloween, does that count?

02:58:27.720 --> 02:58:28.720
I hate that name.

02:58:28.720 --> 02:58:29.720
I love Pokemon.

02:58:29.720 --> 02:58:31.960
You're watching The American Craft!

02:58:31.960 --> 02:58:36.960
I am watching the American Graph. I've seen a shitload of Pokemon trainers up in Animexpo.

02:58:36.960 --> 02:58:40.960
Alright, somebody started to ride on the Orange Orange forums, what should I cosplay?

02:58:40.960 --> 02:58:45.960
Loki, what would you cosplay as? Gendo the Uberpimp.

02:58:45.960 --> 02:58:49.960
Alright. Let's see, I'll probably cosplay as Blanka for next year.

02:58:49.960 --> 02:58:52.960
I am not cosplaying as Noodle, thank you.

02:58:52.960 --> 02:58:59.960
I don't know, that would be fun. Oh yeah, we get some body paint and do something for the Masquerade for Animexpo.

02:58:59.960 --> 02:59:04.360
We have another really good question from the chatroom.

02:59:04.360 --> 02:59:08.640
Maluja wants to know, what does Loki think about do-it-yourself abortion kits?

02:59:08.640 --> 02:59:09.640
It's so much fun.

02:59:09.640 --> 02:59:10.640
It's great.

02:59:10.640 --> 02:59:15.160
That'll never get old, Loki.

02:59:15.160 --> 02:59:19.520
Yeah, but you gotta clip it out.

02:59:19.520 --> 02:59:26.320
And TomoKun would like to point out, Loki, a Power Mac, it's like a PC, they are 100%

02:59:26.320 --> 02:59:27.320
upgradeable.

02:59:27.320 --> 02:59:28.880
From shit to crap.

02:59:28.880 --> 02:59:36.880
Stop it! You are... You know what? For your birthday, I'm buying you a gift certificate to the Apple store, and you will set it on fire.

02:59:36.880 --> 02:59:39.880
You could just suffer. You will have to find something you like.

02:59:39.880 --> 02:59:46.880
I will buy... If you give me enough money to buy an iPod, I will buy an iPod and I will take a sledgehammer to it.

02:59:46.880 --> 02:59:47.880
And then I will sell it.

02:59:47.880 --> 02:59:49.880
You're just a bastard.

02:59:49.880 --> 02:59:53.880
I love my iPod. It's like the best thing ever.

02:59:53.880 --> 02:59:58.380
They said I am a little upset because my roommate just bought an iPod and he paid the same price

02:59:58.380 --> 03:00:02.340
for his that I paid for mine, but because he bought his six months later, he got a color

03:00:02.340 --> 03:00:03.340
one.

03:00:03.340 --> 03:00:04.340
Bastard.

03:00:04.340 --> 03:00:05.340
Alright.

03:00:05.340 --> 03:00:08.260
Anyway, that's going to do it for Ask Orange Lounge.

03:00:08.260 --> 03:00:11.280
Thank you guys for submitting your questions.

03:00:11.280 --> 03:00:15.500
And now, it's 9.30, it's time to end the show.

03:00:15.500 --> 03:00:16.780
Final thought time.

03:00:16.780 --> 03:00:18.780
Explicit, your final thought.

03:00:18.780 --> 03:00:24.540
oh it's nice to meet you guys again just take the good old times I'm glad you

03:00:24.540 --> 03:00:28.980
found the new house okay yeah that too and I'm and I finally got a chance to

03:00:28.980 --> 03:00:32.260
come over here to introduce the tournament finally since I was been so

03:00:32.260 --> 03:00:39.460
busy yeah there's a tournament that's in July 30th this Saturday DDRPA and

03:00:39.460 --> 03:00:44.060
freestyle and it's possible that newspaper journalists will come in for

03:00:44.060 --> 03:00:48.060
like Sacramento Bee. And don't forget, there's Lumpia and Ice Cream.

03:00:48.060 --> 03:00:50.060
And you might get your foot in the paper.

03:00:50.060 --> 03:00:51.060
Hmm, Lumpia.

03:00:51.060 --> 03:00:52.060
Hmm, Lumpia, I agree.

03:00:52.060 --> 03:00:53.060
Say again, what about my foot?

03:00:53.060 --> 03:00:55.060
You might get your foot in the paper, just like Loki did.

03:00:55.060 --> 03:00:59.060
If Sac Bee comes out, because you know Loki's foot was in the Sac Bee, playing DDR.

03:00:59.060 --> 03:01:00.060
Oh, wow.

03:01:00.060 --> 03:01:04.060
Have fun at the tournament. That'll be at Paradise Island in Sacramento, California.

03:01:04.060 --> 03:01:05.060
Yes.

03:01:05.060 --> 03:01:06.060
All right, have fun.

03:01:06.060 --> 03:01:09.060
In addition to a Super Smash Brothers meal, for those who are interested in that.

03:01:09.060 --> 03:01:13.060
I'll just do, you know my strategy at Super Smash Brothers is to just play as Ness.

03:01:13.060 --> 03:01:16.060
PK Fire! PK Fire! PK Fire!

03:01:16.060 --> 03:01:19.060
Lowkey! Your final thought.

03:01:19.060 --> 03:01:22.060
I just unlocked the third picture in Peek-a-boo-pooger.

03:01:22.060 --> 03:01:25.060
In which dialogue set? No, wait, no.

03:01:25.060 --> 03:01:30.060
Hey, what are you guys doing out there while you're watching my moves?

03:01:30.060 --> 03:01:32.060
What the hell does that mean? That's retarded.

03:01:32.060 --> 03:01:34.060
I don't think that's what the fanboys are watching.

03:01:34.060 --> 03:01:36.060
See? Oh yeah.

03:01:36.060 --> 03:01:42.060
My final thought is I'm craving dinner because I haven't eaten, like, a real meal yet today

03:01:42.060 --> 03:01:45.060
and you guys ate all those chicken nuggets and didn't save me one.

03:01:45.060 --> 03:01:48.060
And I ate the two barbecue sauce packets. Ew.

03:01:48.060 --> 03:01:51.060
I bought cheese and cherries.

03:01:51.060 --> 03:01:57.060
Loki, I hope you go home and find all your computers that were replaced with Macs.

03:01:57.060 --> 03:01:59.060
DarkSakura, your final thought?

03:01:59.060 --> 03:02:01.060
Reject sauce icons.

03:02:01.060 --> 03:02:05.060
Did somebody buy me that 2D shirt at Hot Topic?

03:02:05.060 --> 03:02:07.060
The final word of the show, one word to sum it all up.

03:02:07.060 --> 03:02:10.060
Since we actually have a special guest tonight, I'll give it to him.

03:02:10.060 --> 03:02:15.300
Oh, next week on Orange Honors Radio, are we taking a vacation for two weeks?

03:02:15.300 --> 03:02:16.300
Or what are we doing?

03:02:16.300 --> 03:02:17.300
Maybe.

03:02:17.300 --> 03:02:18.300
We might do something.

03:02:18.300 --> 03:02:19.300
Stay tuned to the website.

03:02:19.300 --> 03:02:21.700
Our podcast will still be coming to you no matter what.

03:02:21.700 --> 03:02:24.060
You may have Dark Sakura chat.

03:02:24.060 --> 03:02:25.060
We don't know.

03:02:25.060 --> 03:02:28.380
Something will happen on the station the next couple of weeks, whether it be reruns.

03:02:28.380 --> 03:02:31.260
It won't be our normal three-hour show, but something.

03:02:31.260 --> 03:02:34.220
Or maybe it will be the three-hour show, just sounds sky.

03:02:34.220 --> 03:02:35.220
We'll see.

03:02:35.220 --> 03:02:36.220
Maybe.

03:02:36.220 --> 03:02:38.700
We have to hash that out this week in big board meetings.

03:02:38.700 --> 03:02:39.700
So we'll see.

03:02:39.700 --> 03:02:43.580
We'll see. Alright, that's going to do it.

03:02:43.580 --> 03:02:46.700
Final word of the show, Jonas.

03:02:46.700 --> 03:02:48.700
Mitchie!

03:02:48.700 --> 03:02:54.700

03:03:12.700 --> 03:03:15.700
Crumbs chief, what do we do now?

03:03:15.700 --> 03:03:17.700
I'm taking the direct approach.

03:03:17.700 --> 03:03:20.700
Direct approach? Who knew?

03:03:20.700 --> 03:03:22.700
Who knew? Not that!

03:03:22.700 --> 03:03:26.700
Anything but that, please! Please!

03:03:26.700 --> 03:03:31.700
Oh, Eck! Oh, middle! Oh, crumbs!

03:03:31.700 --> 03:03:32.700
Penfold.

03:03:32.700 --> 03:03:37.700
Please, Tim! You can't! You mustn't!

03:03:37.700 --> 03:03:38.700
Penfold.

03:03:38.700 --> 03:03:40.700
Yes, sheep!

03:03:40.700 --> 03:03:41.700
Shush!

03:03:41.700 --> 03:03:45.700
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.

03:04:11.700 --> 03:04:19.460
All right, guys, we're going to disconnect the station now.

03:04:19.460 --> 03:04:26.220
You can reconnect to Orange Lounge Radio in about, what is it, about 15 seconds to resume

03:04:26.220 --> 03:04:30.580
hearing all your favorite DDR, 2DX, and other video game favorites.

03:04:30.580 --> 03:04:34.060
Loki, what do you think about your new channel, Loki Sucks?

03:04:34.060 --> 03:04:35.540
It's so much fun.

03:04:35.540 --> 03:04:39.380
Good night, guys.

03:04:39.380 --> 03:04:40.220
Have a good one.
