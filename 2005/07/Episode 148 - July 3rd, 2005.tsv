223696	225658	Do you ever walk into his room and look through the DVD collections?
225678	226899	I've seen them from across the hall.
227019	232004	It's just a whole shelf of Buffy and Angel.
232564	236088	I am of the happy for the show, but of the angst for other reasons.
236268	237189	What a waste of money.
237589	238910	Damn you, Hot Topic.

241232	242293	We all have a lot of angst.
242333	243134	I don't know about Loki.
243655	244796	I know I've got big angst.
244816	245937	But I have an refrigerator now!
246872	247332	That's good.
247352	248313	Refrigerators are good.
248593	249293	Cold things are good.
249453	250314	And the washer and dryer.
250354	251995	I have some surprises in the refrigerator right now.
252015	256137	I've never been so excited to be able to do my own laundry in a long time.
256617	258138	Would it be the fish-tasting ice?
258938	260379	No, it's not the fish-tasting ice.
260399	260920	Shut your mouth.
263661	265242	You just... I don't... Oh, forget it.
265282	270405	Anyway, in the other corner, Blabbermouth, who talks before he's introduced, Techmaster Loki.
270745	271625	I'm allowed to talk.
271665	272486	I'm part of the show.
273519	275601	And I'm almost done with my drink!
276001	278123	Loki is already one drink down, boys and girls.
278483	279304	What are you drinking, Loki?
279544	280785	I'm drinking screwdrivers.
280805	282427	That's all I'm going to be drinking all night long.
282447	284228	Screwdrivers, screwdrivers, screwdrivers.
284268	285389	Should I get the rest of the liquor?
286170	287351	I need to be serviced.
287491	288372	I need alcohol.
288812	289393	Okay, hold on.
289433	294798	I'm going to go get the rest of the liquor so DarkSakura can see what I got.
294858	295879	I need to mix my own drink.
295979	298541	I got $40 worth of liquor tonight, so I'm going to go get it.
298581	300203	So somebody's got to fill time during this intro.
300223	301724	Tell the kids what they have to look forward to.
301744	304046	I had ice cream because I'm cheating like hell today.
304647	309271	I am having so much liquor that I'm probably going to end up in the hospital with blood poisoning.
310012	312113	As in, you know, too much blood in my alcohol level.
312133	319335	See, Rob had something rotten in his freezer, so all of his ice tastes really fucking nasty, so all my drinks are, like, not cold.
320116	320916	Wings of fish.
322256	322756	Exactly.
322876	326918	I was like, I smelled, I sniffed in there like, eugh, what is that?
327418	328960	Like, I don't know, man.
329000	337770	I mean, even when our nasty freezer didn't smell that bad, but... I can't really get too shitfaced tonight, because I'm going to go drink at the club, too.
340974	343456	You also got me pineapple Malibu, but I have Guinness!
344157	345379	And a bottle opener!
346744	355471	I got Guinness, peppermint schnapps, Malibu pineapple rum, and there's also Smirnoff mandarin orange.
355611	357212	Do you have any normal Malibu?
358333	364018	I don't think there's any left, I hate to say it.
364298	365078	Guinness on sale!
365198	368281	Is that the same bottle of Bacardi that's been sitting there for like weeks now?
369642	370663	Probably, I don't know.
372164	372624	Guinness!
373265	373845	Good batch!
375086	375627	Oh, buzzy.
377392	379173	Looker, looker, looker.
379233	379974	I want a drink.
380054	381975	I'm going to screw the show.
381995	382776	Give me booze.
382796	384697	We will be back after this break.
385858	386978	What is wrong with that mic?
387119	388800	It's not drunk yet.
389340	390401	It needs more alcohol.
390421	391261	I want to be dunked.
392062	393002	We will work on that.
394303	397165	And of course our alcohol show disclaimer when we come back after this.
397866	400447	We're not responsible for anything we say or do.
400588	401888	Or who we kill.
401988	402569	After this break.
402609	406712	In this break, some music that was popular when Orange Lounge Radio first started.
407672	413257	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
433328	434529	At that point, you probably were.
434569	435309	Yeah.
435989	438330	Up, down, up, down, choo, choo, choo.
438590	441892	In this break, we're going to play some music from Max 2.
442012	444353	We'll start it off with Busta.
444473	446514	I will go find something to open that with.
446754	447694	Isn't it Twisty Off?
449435	449995	We'll be back.
450876	451836	Not Twisty Off.
451856	455718	We'll be back after this with more whining, courtesy of DarkSakura.
477595	478956	The sound, it's coming out now
509674	516040	and I won't stop, like a pistol I keep on turning, like a fire I keep on burning, dance around in the place, and I'm a DJ right to place.
603997	605199	Thanks for watching!
648219	649381	Thanks for watching!
763067	763848	Thank you.
826308	836816	Hi, this is Jamie, you know me better as DarkSakura.
837257	844562	Please feel free to join us on June 23rd at 7pm for our first show of the Orange Lounge, the new Berlani Community Talk Show.
846724	848265	If you're not there, we'll hunt you down.
848285	849306	We know where you live.
849366	850107	We have your numbers.
850147	851208	We looked it up on the internet.
851974	853816	Hello, we're back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
853836	854676	A little bit of retro there.
855097	857579	That was one of the first commercials for Orange Lounge Radio we ran on here.
857999	860261	We are having a catastrophe here in studio.
860301	861743	This is horrible.
863284	867488	Nowhere in this apartment was there a bottle opener anywhere.
869009	870570	Is there screaming coming from the kitchen?
870710	872732	No, but Jamie split a nail.
872992	876075	Jamie split a nail trying to open a bottle of Guinness with a knife.
878846	884651	While I'm running around the house trying to find a lighter that I remember once having that had a bottle opener on the end of it.
885011	891957	And this is the first time that I'm going to regret quitting smoking because if I was still smoking, I'd probably still have that lighter on me.
893878	894179	Oh, well.
895179	906329	How are you feeling now that you finally get... Finally, by the way, Nelly, Loki's fiancee, ran downstairs and picked up a bottle opener from the neighbors, which would have been the smart thing to do in the first place, so...
908089	912532	DarkSakura has a Guinness, Loki's on his second screwdriver.
913733	917836	I still have not drank in anything, so I've got to go get that Guinness that you opened up for me.
918917	919537	So I'll be back.
919557	920258	You guys fill time.
923040	924241	I like Guinness a whole bunch.
925762	926222	Yep, I do.
927583	927904	Why?
929365	934889	It's better than that camel piss they sell, you know, Coors or whatever.
936977	941499	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
959639	965040	I've been listening to show tunes in my car I got the Spamalot CD, the Money Python Broadway play
989176	991298	Night by the way, if you're looking for a quality show...
1019261	1022242	Our show is as good as those fireworks out there.
1022802	1027304	It started off great, but it kind of degrades after, you know, over time.
1027504	1029785	We'll open up the Skype line so you can give your congratulations.
1029805	1031326	We tone it down for your safety.
1031846	1032346	One down!
1035888	1037669	Alright, good luck getting the next one open.
1038569	1039389	That's because I already opened it.
1039469	1039809	Aha!
1040230	1041390	I took one that was already open.
1041410	1042130	I hope you open three.
1043491	1043691	Okay.
1045137	1046680	Oh, they gave us the bottle opener, it doesn't matter.
1047421	1048743	Yeah, no, the neighbors downstairs gave it to us.
1049164	1049625	They took it back.
1051789	1052871	Right, and they said, no, keep it.
1056041	1057382	DarkSakura's all excited.
1057722	1058203	All right, anyway.
1058863	1059424	How was your week?
1059464	1060024	How was your day?
1060064	1061826	We'll start off the show with the classic.
1061846	1064928	We weren't here last week, so we've got two weeks to catch up on.
1064948	1065749	What did they do last week?
1065769	1066289	Oh, wait, I'm sorry.
1066309	1067510	We have to do the drunk disclaimer.
1067850	1068130	I'm sorry.
1068150	1069572	We have to start off the show with a drunk disclaimer.
1069912	1074796	Boys and girls, myself, Loki, and DarkSakura all indulging in a little bit of liquor tonight.
1075176	1078959	But please, if you are going to drink, drink responsibly, which we will be doing for the most part.
1079679	1081241	And have a designated driver.
1081281	1082862	We do have several designated drivers tonight.
1082982	1084123	Extifer is remaining sober.
1084383	1084683	DarkSakura.com
1099796	1101256	Blame it on Grand Theft Auto.
1101556	1102717	Yes, blame it on Grand Theft Auto.
1102737	1103217	They'll believe that.
1103477	1104017	Exactly.
1104097	1104697	Alright, how was your week?
1104717	1105057	How was your day?
1105097	1106158	What was it?
1106198	1106518	My week?
1106938	1107738	What did I do last week?
1107938	1110979	I think I went down and met the rabbi.
1111219	1112679	I believe that was last week.
1113059	1115260	And we went down to San Francisco and that kind of sucked.
1116660	1117801	Yeah, that's what we did last Sunday.
1119141	1126683	So we did that and that was kind of boring because, you know, San Francisco sucks and it was kind of cold and we went to the Cheesecake Factory and they have lean pizza there.
1127264	1128124	I picked up Destroy All Humans
1140758	1146401	and I actually beat that game today and what else?
1146862	1170375	Oh, I got another PSP as a spiff from my work so now I have two PSPs and I'm playing this game Dead to Rights Reckoning right now which is okay and no DDR at all because I have no computer to play it on my cabinet because my sister is borrowing my cabinet computer and that sucks.
1170839	1171079	Why?
1171600	1173323	Because she needs a computer for school.
1174264	1177349	And I tried building her one out of the really shitty parts I had, and it didn't work.
1180474	1181716	Alas, she had to borrow it.
1182998	1185602	So my cabinet computer is gone for the summer.
1187634	1187934	Oh well.
1188015	1189436	It's not like you were using it anyway.
1189616	1190517	No, I used it once.
1190537	1194462	You built this huge main cabinet, it was a huge deal, and you spent how much money on this main cabinet?
1194682	1195282	About $3,000.
1195322	1197425	Yeah, thousands of dollars on this cabinet.
1197785	1200788	And then, I think I saw you play in the Simpsons arcade game once.
1201649	1203031	I used to play a lot more than that.
1203982	1209725	It's just, you know, what it comes down to right now is just I haven't been able to work on it lately.
1209925	1214127	You know, once I get more stuff in there, like a Beatmania controller or something, it'll be a lot more fun.
1214808	1227555	And I was playing DDR on it, but the problem is I have to still mod the pads to ground up static on them, and then it'll work, and then I can play DDR and get in shape and the whole plan and everything.
1228275	1231777	But right now, it's just, you know... Are you going to have a six-pack and all that stuff?
1233752	1235233	Wait, how are you on number three already?
1235454	1236755	You drank number one in front of us.
1236995	1237716	Double shot of vodka.
1239337	1240979	Well, in that case, I'm on number four.
1244142	1246965	Double shots count as one beverage because it's in one glass.
1247846	1249027	Okay, then where did number two go?
1249067	1250188	I'm still on number one.
1250208	1251730	I am on number three.
1252230	1252751	All right, anyway.
1252791	1253812	Yeah, but where did number two go?
1254732	1255954	I did a double shot of vodka.
1256394	1258056	Oh, well, then what's this that you're drinking now?
1259282	1264284	Uh, sugar-free cherry Jones Soda, and a double shot of vodka.
1264304	1266445	Oh.
1267586	1269447	I can drink vodka straight, thank you.
1270207	1271448	I'm sorry, uh, Mame Cabinet.
1272128	1274549	Anyways, yeah, so, Mame Cabinet and the computer are gone.
1274969	1275289	For now.
1275309	1276990	Because Mrs. Stresser has to do homework.
1278680	1279000	That's it.
1279240	1281882	That's really all I did this week, is just playing Destroy All Humans.
1282222	1289126	It's a lot of fun throwing people around using psychic abilities, especially with the ragdoll physics in that game.
1289446	1295209	It makes for a lot of fun, like you can pick up cows and smash them and stuff, and just people, and it's a lot of fun.
1295429	1295969	A lot of fun.
1297250	1300872	And, um, so that's pretty much all I've been playing this week, and, um...
1302082	1303142	Yeah, that's pretty much it.
1303462	1305763	So, you went and saw the War of the Worlds, right?
1306003	1306423	Oh, yeah.
1306463	1307023	How was that?
1307423	1308364	That was good.
1309204	1310904	I have no interest in seeing War of the Worlds.
1310944	1311525	It was good.
1311885	1315926	I know I've been hearing it's really good, but I'm like, Tom Cruise is so 80s.
1316026	1317126	Who cares about Tom Cruise?
1317366	1318987	Tom Cruise isn't white.
1319027	1320507	And I don't like Spielberg movies, either.
1320607	1321167	I really don't.
1321187	1323828	The only Spielberg movie I ever liked... Terminator 2 was fucking awesome!
1323848	1325768	That was not a Spielberg movie!
1326028	1326349	Wasn't it?
1326389	1326949	Yeah, it was.
1326969	1327789	No, that was Cameron...
1328069	1330750	Steven Spielberg presents Terminator 2.
1331070	1337253	I don't think you can give Cameron because he's awesome.
1337593	1340994	Termy, can you help me save the world?
1341895	1343115	Yes.
1343255	1343876	Okay.
1345556	1347537	Terminator, phone home.
1347997	1348838	I'll be back.
1349078	1350779	I don't really want to hurt humans.
1350959	1352939	I just have to because I'm programmed this way.
1352959	1356441	Do you think that the Star Wars movies would have been better if Spielberg had a hand in them?
1357353	1359914	No, they couldn't have missed, because anything is better than Lucas.
1360735	1362155	Although, episode 3 was pretty cool.
1362275	1362776	I'll give them that.
1363036	1365617	I saw George Lucas, and I almost looked at him.
1365897	1371480	First off, people, this is not, you know, this is not E- So take the fire up close.
1371540	1371860	No.
1371880	1373481	I am so hot.
1374561	1375582	This is not E.T.
1375642	1376182	Spielberg.
1376242	1378083	This is Dual Spielberg.
1378123	1380064	This is like Dark Spielberg, okay?
1380524	1381685	Like Evil Spielberg.
1382005	1384686	Anyway, so, um- Do you know who I am?
1384706	1386367	Do you have a tray?
1388595	1389596	This is not a game.
1389636	1390958	Who the fuck are you?
1393220	1395223	I didn't even get that.
1396704	1397205	Anyways.
1399407	1401270	I highly recommend going to see this movie.
1401410	1402311	I want to see it again.
1402491	1403352	It was really good.
1403452	1405154	It's a movie that will stick with you.
1405214	1406616	It's just like, you know, like, wow.
1407196	1408458	You know, it's one of those, you know.
1408772	1408992	DarkSakura
1429187	1434329	It's the same thing about the Wicked Witch of the West How could she walk around fucking Oz?
1452017	1453798	When there's condensation in the air.
1454139	1457061	How do we know that Oz was based around a carbon base, you know?
1457301	1461164	Cause it was on fucking Earth and they could freakin' fly a balloon to Kansas!
1462536	1465438	And Batman Begins... Well, Oz is part of Hollywood, dammit!
1465619	1467060	Batman Begins, what the fuck?
1467100	1468140	Our bodies are made of water.
1468180	1468981	What the fuck was that?
1469281	1471723	I haven't seen a damn movie, so shut up.
1471763	1473244	If you saw the movie, what the fuck?
1473264	1474064	Our bodies are made of water.
1474085	1474705	That's a good point.
1474725	1475906	People would explode.
1476246	1477347	I would have liked that better.
1479368	1482931	I liked Batman Begins because it had the setup of one of the 60s Batmans.
1483351	1504516	Honestly, you know, that's been great, like, you know, like, they have this great plan and stuff, you know, the vaporized water and whatnot, and then people start explaining, they're all, well, that's an unseen, that's an unseen side effect, but okay, hey, I'm going with it, you know, poison people, make them explode, whatever, hey, as long as, the same, you know, consequence.
1507419	1509082	DarkSakura, by the way.
1522102	1523802	I've been playing a game non-stop all week, too.
1523842	1525843	I don't know whether to talk about it now or on the podcast.
1525863	1531484	And by the way, usually we tape our podcasts right after the show, so I'm kind of worried about tonight's podcast.
1531544	1532144	Oh, who cares?
1533605	1533985	We'll see.
1534525	1537346	But anyways, yeah, Destroy All Humans, awesome game.
1537406	1537926	It's a lot of fun.
1537986	1547868	What's great about it, though, is one of the main Martian or Furon, the alien race or whatever, is voiced by the guy that does Invader Zim.
1548308	1549329	So it's Zim.
1549869	1552411	The game is basically Invader Zim the game.
1552531	1553471	It's just awesome.
1553491	1558314	And they've got some other voice actors from other cartoons out there.
1558334	1566259	I think there's a guy from King of the Hill and some other ones I recognized but I wasn't positive because I don't remember voice actor names.
1566740	1569061	But Invader Zim guy, I was like, oh!
1570382	1570642	DarkSakura
1596563	1605930	I spent all week moving my shit from my apartment, which sucks a whole bunch of ass.
1606391	1610274	It sucks an ass larger than that of Roseanne Barr at her biggest.
1612015	1614817	Or Rosie O'Donnell at current.
1614897	1615918	God, that one was chunky.
1617759	1621120	Anyway, I've moved all this stuff from the apartment.
1621140	1621861	Well, Dan and I did.
1621881	1622761	It took two days off.
1623041	1624542	And we got all this stuff from our apartment.
1625002	1628063	And he says it's like a really twisted Christmas.
1629003	1634726	Where you're opening all these presents that's full of your own shit and you don't know what's in what box.
1635926	1637647	I've got the kitchen mostly unpacked.
1639527	1640148	And, um...
1641658	1644120	Then working on that today and yesterday for a bit.
1644160	1645460	And then we got our refrigerator.
1646201	1647162	We got our washer and dryer.
1647202	1648562	We spent over $2,700 for that trip.
1648623	1649763	So you're in a house now?
1650224	1650804	I'm in a house.
1651204	1651444	Awesome.
1651464	1652785	I'm going to be living there for some time.
1653246	1662331	And I'm thinking that we might even move studio maybe if everyone's not supposed to because I live in Citrus Heights instead of Rancho Cambodia.
1666214	1666854	That happened too.
1668240	1668460	Really?
1668620	1669100	You don't say.
1669340	1671941	I'm having very juicy burps, and I don't know why.
1671961	1673002	I don't know.
1674342	1676743	Dan's supposed to be here any moment now with my pants.
1677743	1682905	And I've got to go downstairs and pretend to be sober.
1683405	1684706	And make it down the stairs.
1684726	1685646	That's going to be fun.
1686446	1687447	Just slide down the rail.
1688367	1693249	We got a 50-inch freaking HD widescreen projection TV.
1694884	1697292	And this thing is huge.
1697312	1700704	It's a very big TV.
1700764	1701848	Is it 50 inch huge?
1703186	1704687	It is very satisfying.
1706168	1707288	I could do that.
1707728	1708789	I could ride that thing all night.
1709649	1710070	Or watch it.
1710290	1710950	You could ride.
1711270	1713771	She's gonna ride the TV all night long.
1713791	1715132	Did you hear that?
1715232	1717713	I'm going to mix it onto the TV.
1717994	1724577	For those of you keeping drink counts at home, I'm now drinking four shots of Malibu Pineapple mixed with 7-Up.
1725958	1727798	And I have my DDR ice in there.
1727818	1728399	Taste!
1729079	1731420	I found ice trays at Ikea that are arrows.
1731440	1734021	Does the ice taste like fish?
1734121	1734321	No.
1734461	1735761	The drink is hella good, by the way.
1736961	1738842	So the ice is kosher?
1739002	1739782	The ice is kosher.
1740282	1743443	I found out that I'm not as big of a rum fan as I once was.
1743623	1747605	I'm going to go start on shot 5 and 6, I think.
1748805	1754747	Yeah, this is shot 4, but I have had Guinness as well, and I'm going to have Guinness next.
1754767	1755927	We'll count that as a shot, I guess.
1756451	1766782	because I'm going by like, you know, how they count drinks, you know, as a shot of alcohol is a drink and beer is a drink and whatever else is, a glass of wine I guess is a drink, so.
1768106	1774271	This will be... But I'm really, really... I'm gonna take it easy on the show because I'm gonna be at the club tonight.
1774551	1776892	Yeah, we're going to the club later.
1776912	1778374	Well, you guys are going to the club.
1778474	1779254	I ain't going nowhere.
1779274	1783097	Do you think that he would take us by the ATM so I can drink my... Probably.
1783137	1784458	We can talk Xtifer into it.
1784698	1785159	Yay!
1785659	1786560	Xtifer's in a good mood.
1786580	1787280	He met his crush.
1787720	1787840	So...
1788701	1790123	I need to meet his crush next.
1790163	1792245	I need to go down and give him a drunken thank you.
1793326	1795568	And I need to hear his, like, hot British accent.
1795748	1798691	Anyway, I missed your week and your day, but I'm sure it was good.
1799071	1800052	No, it wasn't!
1800533	1801133	Oh, not today.
1801173	1802074	Your day wasn't good.
1802615	1804637	My week was spent with boxes!
1806630	1817955	I sleep surrounded by dirty laundry, because all of our laundry is dirty and we haven't had a washing machine, which we just got today, and guess what I get to do on the 4th of July?
1818535	1818915	Laundry?
1818935	1820096	Fucking laundry!
1820876	1823317	I have neighbors, people.
1823978	1828480	I'm sorry for your neighbors, but I have lots of laundry-related eggs.
1828500	1831641	We realize what happens when they give us a can opener.
1832361	1833822	Come on, or a bottle opener.
1833942	1835823	We like you sexy British men.
1838032	1838592	Jesus.
1838832	1840533	I don't love the sexy British man.
1840573	1840933	I'm sorry.
1841333	1842033	That's okay.
1842393	1843593	I will love him for you.
1843613	1845473	Okay.
1846794	1847574	Alrighty then.
1848234	1849314	I love my Dan.
1850394	1855816	Because he understands that every so often, if I don't have liquor, I'll shrivel up and die.
1856556	1859436	I think if we get a TV show, I'm going to always do it drunk.
1861977	1867398	You're going to sit back and be like, I'm Loki and I'm angry and drunk.
1868965	1879950	I want to be wearing one of those leisure suits, not necessarily a leisure suit, but something like Hugh Hefner would be wearing, like a bathrobe and slippers, and be sitting there with a martini.
1881190	1884211	Some of those hosts on G4 have to be drunk to get through.
1885072	1888873	Don't you know that everyone in Hollywood is either drunk or on drugs?
1889654	1890474	Or roller skates.
1891346	1900787	LOLerskates LOLerskates LOLerskates LOLerskates LOLerskates LOLerskates LOLerskates LOLerskates LOLerskates LOLerskates LOLerskates LOLerskates
1901275	1901755	Oh, God.
1901775	1903217	You know what, Rob?
1903677	1905678	That can has been on your desk for a year.
1906019	1906459	Chatroom?
1906499	1906899	No, it hasn't.
1907180	1914025	Chatroom, they said I only had four drinks, but that is one Guinness and four shots.
1914125	1916186	We're even right now, Chatroom.
1916207	1918088	We're going by government drinks, okay?
1918228	1921611	Technically, this would be a second drink if I were counting actual drinks.
1922812	1927395	By actual drink numbers, Rob has had two, Loki has had two, I have had three.
1928336	1929096	By shot.
1929537	1929737	Yeah.
1930526	1932067	We are all dead tied at five.
1932567	1933507	Well, I'm at four.
1933587	1937309	I'm going to be starting five in just a second here as soon as I finish the last bit of my drink.
1938409	1945753	And I apologize for belching, but I'm having soda with my vodka right now, which I... You all know that I am a belch monster already.
1946833	1950255	That is my one highly unfeminine trait.
1950415	1953156	Excuse me while I take a brief recess to get some more alcohol.
1953736	1959699	I also have other unfeminine traits like climbing trees and shooting people with guns and driving a tank.
1961613	1963354	It's the adventures of LOL!
1964655	1967516	Oh my god!
1967656	1968997	I could do a webcomic of that!
1969797	1971258	Wouldn't that be fucking funny?
1971278	1971338	LOL!
1971518	1973319	You're gonna do a webcomic LOL!
1973479	1973839	LOL!
1975800	1976180	Burb!
1976820	1977401	You're a burb!
1977721	1979382	Loki, you're a burb!
1979702	1980302	Burb!
1980382	1980802	Burb!
1981122	1981483	Burb!
1981823	1982283	Burb!
1983363	1987545	No, seriously, I'm gonna do the Orange Sounds webcomic, but I need someone who does Flash.
1988206	1990767	Cause we need to have our fictional studio online.
1991684	1994810	where everyone can explore and interact with us.
1994830	2000621	Rob, I have an observation for you.
2000661	2001864	It's a very obvious one.
2001904	2002304	What's that?
2003916	2005436	I know, I'm trying my best.
2005557	2006457	It's because you're drinking.
2006497	2007537	You're getting hot from drinking.
2007617	2008618	I'm just hot anyway.
2009938	2010758	We know, we know.
2011819	2013939	Alright, my week and my day.
2013999	2016520	My mutant ability is not belching.
2016900	2018921	It's staring at traffic like, no!
2018941	2021582	Who is the diva of the show?
2021662	2023122	I do not believe that it is you.
2023142	2027043	I am an internet fucking celebrity.
2028764	2031845	I am not a celebrity who fucks the internet, except for screwing it over.
2032808	2034029	I am an internet celebrity.
2034569	2036130	That makes me the diva of the show.
2037191	2037491	Hello?
2038272	2040053	My power cable just fell out of my lap.
2040073	2041274	I'm an internet celebrity too.
2041314	2042394	I have like 140 friends on Myspace.
2042414	2043935	I have to plug myself in again.
2044556	2049819	I joined Myspace a month ago and I have 42 people, including Corey Feldman.
2051981	2053302	Corey Feldman is my buddy.
2055731	2058952	I want to make a MySpace profile for Adventures of LoL.
2059513	2060153	I'm sorry.
2060633	2063054	I made an Orange Zones one, but I haven't done shit with it yet.
2063194	2064214	I'm not in heat, shut up!
2066155	2067716	If I were in heat, you would know.
2067996	2070317	Because if it wouldn't be you, I would be Heat Matt.
2072037	2072398	Wow.
2072838	2074138	Are you finished so I can talk about my week?
2074158	2074959	Because my week sucked.
2075099	2075579	Fuck your week.
2076687	2082310	I give you permission to speak, oh Rob, who sits by the computer, with your legs all crossed, you need a cigarette now, you are so like...
2094018	2099686	You were the most supportive of me stopping smoking, and now you're like, you want a cigar tonight?
2099726	2102409	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
2103090	2107917	I do not believe in cigarettes, because cigarettes are very addicting.
2108377	2110418	I do have my secret hidden stash.
2111058	2114319	Claims I'm fine with, because you best be hooking me up with that.
2115620	2125084	I have found out from my fiance, he's not really happy about it, but he is okay with me having a cigar every so often.
2125704	2129345	So I picked up a pack of Black Milds, because they're pipe tobacco.
2129425	2129605	Nope.
2130005	2131446	And pipe tobacco is sexy.
2131506	2133367	We really don't endorse smoking, boys and girls.
2133407	2133827	Don't start.
2133847	2134047	Select!
2135728	2136689	Don't start, kids.
2136989	2137849	It's a nasty habit.
2138149	2142932	It is a nasty habit, and if you have your lungs full of tar, we'll laugh at you when you croak.
2144373	2145553	Okay, tell us about your week, Rob.
2145593	2146714	I bet it was fascinating.
2146814	2149956	No, my car was broken into for the second time this week.
2150096	2151116	You should move.
2151177	2155739	This time they smashed a window, and they took my new stereo that the insurance company had replaced.
2156199	2158861	They dug through my car until they found my faceplate.
2158901	2164664	I mean, okay, stupid me for keeping my faceplate in my car, but I had it in a secret spot where I didn't think anyone would find it.
2166036	2168198	I'll get the fan in a little bit so it cools off in here.
2168698	2169379	Wait, hold on.
2170820	2172020	I'm giving Jamie some competition.
2172281	2173782	You're red in the face, Loki.
2173922	2175162	It's fine in here.
2175183	2176163	Loki, you're red.
2176744	2178545	I'm going to give you my Zim doll.
2180146	2181667	I have a big plushie Zim pillow.
2182387	2184329	Why do I have a big plushie girl pillow?
2184369	2186030	Our chatroom is www.org.com.
2186050	2187371	Why is the chatroom saying our stream dropped?
2187391	2187931	No, we're still up.
2188051	2188651	We always have it up.
2194975	2195756	I'm always up.
2197797	2200579	Don't make me waste my vodka by spitting it on your face.
2200599	2202840	I don't even want to discuss stuff like that.
2204682	2205923	Just because, yeah.
2206183	2206883	What happened?
2208444	2209865	Well, it's not what happened.
2211166	2215989	We're not going to go there because that's a little, you know, beyond the show format here, okay?
2216310	2219132	It's not, you know, let's talk about Loki's sex life.
2219192	2220573	And it's not a bad thing either.
2220633	2222554	It's good stuff, but, you know, it's just,
2224017	2226399	It's a side effect to having a cold.
2227140	2228481	I get a weird side effect.
2229542	2231665	And so, it's just odd.
2233146	2234548	We're not going to talk about it, okay?
2236550	2237871	I don't know what he's laughing about.
2237891	2239333	Can we get Nelly in here to clarify?
2239353	2239433	Okay.
2240885	2242948	I can tell you what it is, but I'm not sure.
2242968	2244390	I have a replacement for Dunk.
2244591	2245652	I don't think the listeners want to hear it.
2245672	2246393	It's in the chat room.
2246413	2247455	I have a replacement for Dunk.
2247876	2248316	What's that?
2248677	2248997	Dirk.
2249618	2249939	Dirk?
2250459	2250760	Dirk?
2251361	2251661	All right.
2252062	2253023	Anyway, um...
2254960	2255320	What was it?
2255340	2256340	Oh, my car got broken into.
2256680	2260502	And this time, instead of just prying open the door, they actually smashed one of my windows.
2260802	2264123	And the insurance company won't replace my broken window until a week from today.
2264803	2265563	Isn't that stupid?
2265843	2266723	So I'm driving around.
2267023	2273325	Oh, and to add insult to injury, they fucked up my lock on the driver's side, so I can't even open my driver door.
2273345	2280167	So I get into my car, I have to open up the passenger door, climb my fat ass across the seat, and then I get to sit down.
2280587	2281368	Sucks.
2281408	2284069	Did they fuck up the lock on the outside or the lock all together?
2285630	2286911	I can't open the door from the inside.
2286931	2291654	Yeah, because my old car used to have to pop open the door on the passenger side, unlock the door, and then walk around.
2291754	2292634	No, it won't even work.
2293274	2297797	Because some dumbass tried to open the lock with a screwdriver and that didn't work.
2297817	2300759	My door won't even open from the... I don't even know how they're going to fix it.
2300899	2301459	It'll be incredible.
2301779	2302460	But it's great, though.
2302500	2305462	See, my old car, they were trying to steal the stock stereo.
2305502	2307523	I have to tell something to Illusion real quick.
2307683	2307923	What?
2308623	2309064	What?
2313820	2315720	I saw that movie, it's great.
2315740	2316620	Here's my ferret impersonation.
2343959	2344799	All right, so that was my week.
2344839	2345739	My car got broken into.
2345759	2345980	That sucks.
2346000	2347400	That's not an impersonation.
2347940	2348620	Shut up!
2349100	2352201	I'll talk about this more on the podcast if I can, if I'm not too insanely drunk.
2352501	2354802	But I was playing Meteos all week.
2354842	2355602	Oh, you finally got that?
2355782	2357262	Oh, it just came out this past week.
2357282	2357642	Well, I know.
2358242	2358923	It's so hot.
2359083	2359443	I love it.
2359523	2362243	Meteos is like the reason why there's a DS.
2362964	2364464	Meteos makes... I'm gonna...
2366118	2367239	Shove that thing up your ass.
2369140	2371682	Meteos is the reason why they made a DS, seriously.
2372343	2375585	Everything good about the DS technology is used in Meteos.
2375666	2376026	I love it.
2376786	2378548	I want to make sweet love to it and have its babies.
2380749	2382891	And those babies will be Nintendogs.
2383692	2385093	Hey, hey, Illusion, guess what?
2389798	2396000	If I could stab this microphone to my brain, I'd do it right now, but since that's impossible.
2396300	2402463	To answer a question in chat room, somebody's saying that in response to my car getting broken into, they said, that's what insurance is for.
2402843	2409025	Yeah, well, I still have a $100 deductible, which sucks, and they'll probably jack up my rates because it's the second time my car's been broken into.
2409045	2411926	This is because you moved into Rancho Cambodia.
2414387	2417888	I swear, like, they're trying to...
2420755	2426520	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2442961	2444182	I like you, chat room person.
2444482	2445103	That was Misty.
2445703	2447365	Misty, you were awesome.
2447445	2449126	I've got music with me.
2449327	2450287	Because this is a segue.
2450628	2451348	It's a good segue.
2451408	2453871	Because we're going to talk about Akira Yamaoka when we come back, if we can.
2454131	2455692	I need Kutima DXY.
2456593	2457534	If I can find it.
2457794	2458394	Let's do it again.
2458434	2458695	All right.
2459175	2461857	Well, this song's like four minutes, or five minutes, so we're going to play it.
2461877	2463359	So we're going to come back and talk about Akira.
2463519	2464420	Do that and then play...
2467262	2468263	What's that other one?
2469443	2470964	The one that's named after a Beatles song.
2471004	2471564	Let me do it.
2472005	2472665	I'll see what we can do.
2472705	2472965	All right.
2473345	2476207	We'll get some music, and then we'll be back with more Orange Launcher.
2476227	2477547	And we're going to open up the Skype line.
2477587	2482650	So if you guys want to talk to us in our, what's the word?
2483190	2484031	Drunken state?
2484051	2484311	I guess.
2484391	2486172	Drunken, inebriated, I don't know, state.
2486512	2487833	You will have the opportunity when we come back.
2487853	2489954	Go to orangelauncher.com and interact with us.
2490994	2491815	They said I looked pink.
2492571	2492992	Interesting.
2493112	2494295	Alright, we'll be back after this.
2494636	2497884	Your Rain, the Rage Mix from Akira Yamaoka, because we're going to talk about him when we come back.
2498907	2499368	Akira.
2499408	2500230	And how hot he is.
2500591	2501052	We'll be back.
2501253	2501734	Okie dokie.
2594392	2595193	Thanks for watching!
2631616	2645441	I'm a sidewalk, I'm a city, I'm a creature, I'm a whisper Is it people, or are we nowhere?
2645461	2647201	There is no glory, no compassion
2688451	2695297	Out of my head, and I don't know where to go Over and over, I feel the break with God
2727074	2733682	On the sidewalk of the city, on the streets of the river, there's a people going nowhere, see me talking all right.
2733702	2739169	There's a passion, there's a matter, my resistance is waving, like a flower in the basement.
2823233	2825302	Thank you for watching
2905799	2909743	Hello out there, this is Rob, but you might know me in the online world as Sky.
2910284	2920935	On June 23rd at 7pm Pacific Time, join DarkSakura and I for the Orange Lounge, the Bomani Scene's newest talk radio program, where we'll talk about all the latest in everything Bomani.
2921415	2925620	It's a whole show dedicated to those games that we never shut up about.
2930018	2932102	DarkSakura.
2932182	2934305	Why the fuck did you play that one?
2934326	2935187	DarkSakura.
2935267	2937671	Rob, put out your hand.
2939500	2940400	DarkSakura DarkSakura
2965720	2967362	Alan didn't want to come out.
2967902	2969303	That burp didn't want to come out.
2987085	2988846	So, it's been huge for us.
2988906	2995828	We have so many more listeners now, thanks to iTunes making it really easy to subscribe to podcasts.
2995848	2998009	We have like a million listeners.
2998029	2999489	That was a sobering belch.
3000910	3004051	Oh, for those of you guys keeping track at home, I am on shots 6, 7, 8, and 9.
3005390	3008052	Dan is going to be here before too long with my pants.
3026659	3029840	Arcanium 42 made the funniest joke in the chatroom.
3029860	3030320	Dark Lekura.
3030340	3030880	That is not funny.
3030920	3031521	I didn't laugh.
3031561	3032261	I laughed a lot.
3032281	3033501	The diva says it's not funny.
3033941	3034722	Too bad.
3034742	3035002	Alright.
3053703	3055965	Loki was not a part of the show when we first started.
3056225	3057666	That's right, I was a guest.
3057786	3059007	Loki has to wait for us through Berlin.
3059027	3059988	He had to sit on the floor.
3060068	3065533	Loki was a guest host for 19 episodes, and then we were like, well, what the fuck, we'll make him a host.
3065953	3069796	But I feel bad for Angel, because Angel's now been a guest for probably like 50 shows.
3069836	3071398	Hey, she stopped showing up, though.
3072659	3073459	Yeah, where is she?
3074340	3078782	She wanted to come tonight, but because of my car break-in, I couldn't provide her transportation after tonight's show.
3079062	3079942	She's listening, I'm sure.
3080363	3081623	Or she's getting an archive of the show.
3081983	3087666	But now DDR Angel's been sitting on the floor for like 50 episodes, and now we're like, oh, three's too many.
3089027	3089807	Sorry, DDR Angel.
3089827	3092148	She's a chronicle.
3092548	3093709	Yeah, she's our chronic guest.
3094669	3095890	The chronic, yo!
3095990	3096850	She's our chronic.
3097210	3098031	She's a blunt, yo.
3098871	3100272	I'm gonna have more liquor.
3100854	3101794	All right.
3102514	3103615	I get to pee first.
3105535	3108276	Should I open up the Skype line or should I talk about the Akira Yamaoka album?
3108416	3109196	Akira Yamaoka.
3109336	3110197	Akira Yamaoka.
3110217	3111757	Akira Yamaoka is getting his own album.
3111877	3114778	It's coming out October 28th in Japan.
3114798	3117479	Akira Yamaoka, by the way, did the songs on his last break.
3118139	3122440	Akira Yamaoka, famous for his DDR music, beat mania music, as well as Silent Hill.
3122480	3122920	Hello.
3123400	3124000	What else has he done?
3124040	3125281	He did some music for Contra.
3125361	3125861	Contra is.
3126361	3127002	Shattered Soldier
3155930	3160780	And they didn't say anything about Silent Hill songs, but of course Silent Hill already has their own soundtrack, so who cares, right?
3161742	3166792	We have, let's see, two Bomani songs, six cover songs.
3167864	3169945	Which could be just about anything.
3170586	3174968	I know what some of those... Two brand new songs.
3175268	3177710	I know what some of those cover songs are.
3177730	3178350	You think you do.
3178630	3179511	You don't know for sure.
3179571	3180271	You think you might.
3180291	3181592	I suspect with some of those.
3181952	3183373	But I can't say anything, of course.
3183613	3184473	But anyways.
3185574	3187695	But yeah, I mean, Kiriyama is awesome.
3187735	3189416	So whatever he's going to do is going to be awesome.
3189576	3190217	Yes, that's right.
3190377	3190537	Yeah.
3193337	3193898	It should be fun.
3193918	3194518	It should be fun.
3194618	3199121	And if you want more information on that, KonamiStyle.jp has a whole page dedicated to the project.
3199741	3200882	So it should be pretty awesome.
3201322	3201862	So check it out.
3202463	3207505	I am really dizzy.
3208986	3209406	Let's see.
3211208	3212448	Oh, good point from John Fields.
3212468	3216511	We can make Angel the intern since Zero doesn't show up to the show anymore.
3216891	3218312	Wasn't Magus our intern at one point?
3218492	3220373	No, he's the eternal freshman of Orange Launch.
3220393	3220693	I forgot.
3221115	3241851	He's the keeper of the Portuguese joke book That's right, he's the Portuguese joke book keeper Oh man, I am so dizzy I thought this was interesting, the story you posted earlier this week We'll probably talk about this more on the podcast But the PlayStation 3, $400 to buy a PlayStation 3?
3241931	3243973	Is it going to do my dishes?
3244533	3245514	If not, fuck it
3246550	3250111	Well, you do have to understand the Xbox 360 games are $60 each.
3250391	3251871	Oh my, that is insane.
3252051	3252672	That is insane.
3254032	3257653	I mean, D of A is pretty, or D of A, it's like a bank suddenly.
3258073	3262694	D or A, Dead or Alive, is pretty cool, but it's not $60 cool.
3263454	3264395	No, it's not.
3265335	3269776	And this is what I've got from, like, you know, basically looking at the release dates we have for the...
3272196	3274637	The Xbox 360 is coming out around November 15th.
3294710	3298374	So yeah, it's going to be about $60 a game for the Xbox 360.
3298774	3301857	I can only assume that the PlayStation 3 stuff is going to be about the same price.
3301917	3305621	If they wanted to be cute, since it's 360, they would release it on March 60th.
3307913	3308554	I don't think so.
3308894	3309875	That's not going to happen.
3310316	3313459	No, they're going to release it on November 16th or 15th.
3313939	3314580	It's around there.
3314800	3319425	I mean, because obviously dates change for the games a lot, so it's up in the air.
3319505	3323389	But most of the publishers are saying that's going to happen at that date.
3323449	3326932	In our chat room, Baka is saying that the games on PS3 are going to be $60 too.
3326952	3329375	Yeah, so it wouldn't be a surprise.
3330930	3332951	I don't spend $50 on a game either.
3333031	3335433	I spent $35 on Meteos and that was like having to give up a finger.
3335453	3337214	Well, you know, most PlayStation 2 games are like $49.99.
3337294	3338334	Not when I buy them.
3338414	3340956	And they wonder why people try to pirate their games.
3356623	3357624	$50 for a game.
3358225	3359586	What about Katamari Damacy?
3359667	3362309	Great game, $20, sold zillions of copies.
3362710	3362309	$20.
3362750	3364511	That should be a model for all games.
3364592	3365733	Second game, though, was $29.99.
3365833	3366854	I think we raised $10, so...
3370231	3371992	But still though, it's worth the extra 10 bucks.
3372052	3373632	It's still not, you know, 44 or 49.99.
3373672	3381155	Not if they're putting out games like, I don't know, what's a game that sucked on PlayStation?
3382535	3383075	Driver 3.
3383696	3384756	Okay, Driver 3.
3385076	3386957	Yeah, I'm gonna pay 60 bucks for Driver 4.
3389627	3393769	Maybe I would pay $60 for Final Fantasy XII, although that's supposedly going to be on.
3393789	3397531	The Driver series sucked after the first game.
3397852	3403295	The second game just sucked ass, and the third game was just... It was so bad it was funny.
3403875	3405837	But, I don't know.
3406977	3411180	They think they can justify that amount for the next-gen consoles, because...
3411520	3412802	The graphics are better!
3414485	3418772	Game companies, this is why people hack your shit, because you're charging too much for your damn games.
3419272	3422477	It'll probably cost them more to actually make these games.
3424901	3430443	Part of the cost involved with the creation of the games also has to do with fighting loss of profit.
3430483	3431123	They have to make...
3444208	3449610	For a company to be considered successful, they have to make a certain amount over production cost.
3450431	3458975	Therefore, they are trying to accommodate for what they have already lost versus what they may stand to lose and do their prices accordingly.
3459515	3464397	Therefore, a $10 markup in price is not unreasonable nor is it unexpected.
3465595	3466977	What other things could I buy for $60?
3467478	3469220	All the liquor I bought tonight was $40.
3469501	3472004	That's more fun than Driver 3.
3472485	3474367	Okay, because basically games have been about $50 since...
3476374	3478296	Even the Super Nintendo.
3478456	3481879	I remember when Street Fighter was like a $70 game.
3481999	3484421	Okay, that's ridiculous.
3484601	3488544	I could get a GameCube for $70 now.
3488944	3491226	That's ridiculous for Street Fighter being that expensive.
3491506	3495790	But I remember most of my Super Nintendo games being about $49.99.
3496991	3498892	It hasn't really changed that much since then.
3498992	3502955	I paid $60 for Killer Instinct when it came out on the Super Nintendo.
3502975	3503856	That's bullshit.
3505217	3506920	This was a shitty port.
3507582	3511348	This was ten years ago that I bought this damn game.
3512029	3514073	Yeah, with inflation and everything, that's like $80 now.
3514794	3517439	Seriously though, $60 isn't that bad.
3517499	3518461	I mean, when you consider it.
3518891	3523373	I mean, the system being $400, yeah, that kind of sucks.
3523833	3533496	But I would hope that this would be a little bit better than, you know, it's going to be playing the next-gen, like, whatever the media is going to be, like, HD, DVD, or Blu-ray, or whatever.
3533997	3534917	It's going to be playing that.
3534957	3538478	So you've basically got, you know, next-gen players in that sense.
3538838	3539519	You've also got...
3540559	3541519	I don't understand this.
3541599	3545140	You know, PlayStation 3, for some reason, had, like, three Ethernet ports on there.
3545280	3549041	I don't know what the hell that's for, but I'm sure they're going to use it for something.
3549281	3551262	And, um, I don't know.
3551502	3554643	I think, you know, $399 for the system isn't that bad.
3555003	3558124	People are going to be like, eh, it's kind of expensive, but they're going to pay for it.
3558484	3565705	But the Revolution, though, they're saying is going to be cheaper, much like how, you know, the DS was only $151, the PSP was, like, you know, $300, you know, so...
3568902	3576787	You know, people might, if they're really, you know, concerned about costs, they'll pay for the, you know, the Revolution versus the PS3 or the, um, 360.
3577268	3580530	I want to read some comments in the chat, or moreinsolventradio.com, click on chat.
3580610	3585293	I gotta go get more alcohol, because I'm dizzy as hell, and if I drink some more, I might pass out.
3585313	3585693	That'd be good.
3585853	3591617	Sakurina says, uh, I could buy a lot of, and if I mispronounce that, my apologies, at least I didn't say, um, Sakurina.
3592598	3596820	Uh, I could buy a lot of Kleenex for $60 and could have more fun than Driver 3.
3598002	3603180	I agree, I could buy toilet paper and make a mess of somebody's lawn and that would be more fun than Driver 3.
3603996	3606177	I grabbed my booze instead of my microphone.
3606737	3607838	What's wrong with this picture?
3607858	3608378	That's good.
3608598	3611839	No, I could wipe my ass and have more fun than Driver 3 was.
3612460	3615301	Now, DarkSakura, you're the resident Sega whore.
3615881	3617962	Our resident Sega man whore in the chatroom.
3617982	3620923	Actually, I think there's two of them, because I think John Fields is a big Sega man whore, too.
3620963	3629427	But the other one that I know of, this local Arcadian42, huge Sega man whore, says Phantasy Star 4 was $100 when it first came out.
3629467	3629887	Is that true?
3630547	3640899	Final Fantasy II was $80, says John Fields.
3641260	3642060	I think that's right.
3642121	3643282	I think I remember paying like $70.
3643382	3644643	Well, I didn't pay it.
3644683	3647066	I begged my mommy because I got straight A's.
3648468	3649889	You need a nerdlet.
3650993	3652274	I got straight A's.
3652695	3655637	No, you want to hear about my junior high school experience and straight A's?
3656037	3657959	I got all A's.
3658039	3664885	My first semester of junior high school, I got all A's and a B and P. But my parents never cared about P. So they always threw that out.
3664905	3665525	They didn't count that.
3665906	3669249	But my mom would go, you got an A minus in math?
3671310	3672271	You know what I got?
3672291	3676235	A D and a C because I didn't give a fuck.
3678214	3679535	My school bored me.
3680256	3685400	And I would make A's on all of my tests, but get zeros for homework because I wouldn't fucking do it.
3685640	3686341	That was me too.
3686421	3687302	I never did my homework.
3687822	3688603	I was a bad boy.
3690104	3692146	That first semester of junior high, it went all downhill from there.
3692346	3695008	I just started not doing homework and stuff, and I slacked off.
3695849	3697350	And look where I'm at now, kids.
3698071	3699932	I'm on an internet radio station.
3701113	3702394	You want to be like me?
3702535	3704036	We're fucking celebrities.
3704816	3706418	Because we didn't do well in school.
3708854	3711136	Baka wants to know how I got a B in PE.
3711716	3715078	Because I could run a mile in like 14 minutes.
3715499	3717140	That's how I got a B in PE.
3719681	3722403	My best friend in junior high and I used to walk the mile every day.
3723284	3726086	We would run until the teacher couldn't see us anymore, then we'd walk the rest of it.
3726506	3726966	It's awesome.
3727106	3731189	One time, just to prove I could do it, I sprinted a half mile.
3732670	3733711	Just to prove I could do it.
3735492	3737634	I would barf if I ever tried that.
3738427	3738947	You're horrible.
3739668	3740469	I ran for it.
3740529	3741870	I was so tired by the time I got there.
3742190	3743711	But I beat everybody, damn it.
3745153	3748115	And now I can't run because I'm injured.
3749977	3751278	I have to make an announcement here.
3751318	3754180	I think if the site's still up right now, because the site's been going up and down.
3754260	3754701	Oh, never mind.
3755261	3755541	Never mind.
3755802	3756422	I'll talk about it later.
3757063	3757403	It's down.
3759565	3760385	Let's go to...
3763137	3765260	Baka says I'm in the chatroom.
3765320	3771871	Baka in our chatroom says, and our chatroom's over at www.orangeloungeradio.com.
3772251	3774915	Click on, what is it, chat?
3774935	3775016	Yeah.
3776913	3779114	I cannot believe that you were drunk off of that.
3779895	3781256	Baka says, I'm Asian.
3781436	3783377	I get 3.6s and 4.0s.
3784557	3786658	I want to hear from an Asian who gets shitty grades.
3787059	3787579	Seriously.
3788099	3791941	I want to hear from somebody who defies the stereotype and gets like Cs and Ds.
3792342	3795363	Because that's a messed up stereotype that all Asians get like good grades.
3795743	3798765	Surely there's a flunky Asian out there somewhere and I want to hear from them.

3813243	3814204	We've been drinking a little bit.
3814484	3816584	Loki's taking way too long with his next drinks.
3818264	3818524	Man.
3819025	3820285	He's talking about puking.
3820525	3821945	I'm hearing him talking about puking, too.
3822865	3827967	Hey, somebody in our chatroom disputing us there saying we're not celebrities, but we're close.
3828247	3829807	We are two fucking celebrities.
3832045	3834807	Don't we have pages upon pages of internet stuff?
3834827	3835987	I have 140 friends on Myspace.
3836007	3836868	Doesn't that make me a celebrity?
3837248	3837408	No.
3837668	3839950	No, that just makes you a big internet nerd.
3839990	3841290	I'm gonna let you guys in on a secret.
3841310	3842071	It's a big secret.
3843312	3845233	We don't really believe the celebrity thing.
3845293	3846033	It's just a joke.
3846414	3846694	Okay?
3847734	3848335	Guess what?
3848555	3848795	What?
3849115	3851016	I really am a celebrity.
3855019	3857240	Loki's talking about puke.
3857320	3858841	Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.
3861238	3863760	I hope we get a call on the skypline at some point.
3863780	3864161	Skypline!
3864201	3865022	Fucking call us!
3865042	3868845	I don't want to do... Did you hear about Britney Spears?
3868925	3869506	Shut up, shut up.
3869626	3871648	She's still smoking and pregnant.
3871888	3874590	Loki, for those keeping drink tally at home, what are you on now?
3874891	3875812	I'm on 7 and 8.
3876012	3876672	We're getting a call.
3878674	3880996	7 and 8 and I'm very, very, very dizzy.
3881116	3882237	Let's go to the phone lines.
3882278	3883499	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3884199	3885200	Hey Sky, Siggy here.
3885480	3886822	Hi Siggy, how are you?
3887978	3888919	I'm doing fine.
3888959	3890380	Happy birthday, OLR.
3890920	3891381	Thank you.
3891401	3893062	I appreciate it.
3893122	3895124	Rob is sounding especially gay today.
3895244	3896365	We're potty trained now.
3896385	3898026	We're three years old and we're learning how to read.
3898647	3900348	I'm a big kid now.
3901509	3902610	What's on your mind, Siggy?
3903450	3904471	Have a drink with us, Siggy.
3904751	3904932	Are you 21?
3904992	3907073	Well, I'm 25.
3907714	3907914	Good.
3907954	3908855	Have a drink with us, Siggy.
3909602	3911063	Well, I'd rather have sake, thank you.
3911363	3911623	Oh, okay.
3912004	3912684	Oh, okay.
3912704	3914906	I want some sake.
3915226	3916166	It's too expensive.
3916206	3916807	I couldn't buy that.
3917147	3918788	Oh, sake, I'm only 30!
3919228	3920109	Sake, you lady.
3920449	3921590	Oh, bite me.
3921650	3922430	What's up, Ziggy?
3922450	3923071	What's on your mind?
3923646	3928428	Well, I got some, uh, announcement, uh, regarding to, uh, Beat Media 2DX12, Happy Sky.
3928608	3931129	I was gonna say, you had some, you have some news on Happy Sky, don't you?
3931149	3932050	What's up with Happy Sky?
3933230	3938232	Uh, it's gonna, uh, in Japan, it's gonna be released July 13th, which is gonna be nine days from now.
3938712	3940253	Ooh, that's soon, that's awesome.
3940293	3942854	Are there any, like, new songs that are supposed to be in the final release?
3943475	3948317	Cause you know how sometimes there's, um, songs in the final release that weren't in the beta test?
3949917	3950758	Are they doing any of that?
3951178	3951278	Um...
3953001	3959708	They're already done with the location test, but there haven't been any new songs announced as of late.
3961130	3963392	That would be great if there was a couple more new ones, though.
3964734	3965054	Yeah.
3966376	3974024	And then some other news, like... I don't think this has been announced, but Konami has already made their own record label.
3975137	3975517	Really?
3976137	3978118	Yeah, it's called 573 Records.
3978698	3980878	That is the most awesome name ever.
3981418	3982879	I have hiccups now.
3983559	3985999	Is that what labeled the Akira Yamaoka album is going to come out?
3986059	3986859	My hand's numb.
3986939	3995641	I'm not sure, but when I checked the website for 573 Records, they're mostly hip-hop and R&B artists that have signed up for it.
3996521	3997662	What's the website?
3998682	3999062	Here it is.
3999622	4001382	Let me link it on the chat room.
4001782	4002363	Okay, super.
4002443	4002703	Thank you.
4004949	4012552	You know, all this talk about Japanese music has me thinking about, did you hear about those huge Live 8 concerts that were going on yesterday?
4012652	4013332	Yeah.
4014032	4015313	I'm glad I missed them.
4015473	4017353	You know who played at the one in Tokyo?
4017754	4017934	No.
4018594	4019434	Dreams Come True.
4020535	4021695	Oh my god.
4021915	4022795	That's crazy.
4022815	4023276	That's awesome.
4023456	4023716	Sorry.
4024296	4026597	It's a 21 website, so I'm going to mention it on there.
4026617	4028097	It's www.onami.jp.mm.573.
4028117	4028377	Awesome.
4034057	4035698	I'm going to go look at it right now.
4035738	4040461	That reminds me, I need to purchase some of the brand new diverse system stuff.
4040981	4048726	I've kept asking in their stupid bulletin board system whether or not they'll be able to ship this stuff to me because it's not listed on the U.S.
4048786	4049667	site, but they're U.S.
4050620	4053403	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4069651	4074576	and Diverse8's out, and then there's Dear Taka and Dear Desire also.
4075436	4077058	So I need to get those as well.
4077598	4080641	And I don't know, D7 I need to get as well.
4081002	4082643	Because I need to catch up with all their stuff.
4082683	4087628	And I love, oh my god, I've got to listen to the Trip Machine Dark Core version.
4087688	4088348	I love that.
4088469	4092092	Dude, 573 Records is a UMA creative production.
4092152	4094734	That just makes me think that, UMA, UMA!
4095615	4096336	Remember in Maxx?
4099506	4100347	Uh... Shut up.
4100768	4101448	No.
4101609	4102810	Siggy, you know what I'm talking about, right?
4102930	4103971	UMA, UMA!
4105293	4105754	Thank you.
4106795	4108937	So, my hand's numb.
4108997	4110699	Is that a bad thing?
4110920	4111380	I don't know.
4112321	4113423	I wanna take a nap.
4113643	4114224	That's what I want.
4114264	4115986	Siggy, what else is on your mind?
4116877	4121560	Well, um, there's a, yeah, you already know about Dance 86.4, right?
4123161	4124942	Is that, it's 86.4?
4125002	4126584	I thought it was like 95, I don't know.
4126684	4127364	Okay, 86.4.
4128585	4128905	It's 86.4.
4129065	4135289	It's a, you know, they pronounce it as a Dansuya Royo, or it's translated as a Let's Dance.
4135610	4135950	Uh-huh.
4136110	4136450	Okay.
4136750	4139512	I saw the news on DDR Freak, and I was just like, you know.
4139532	4142514	86.4, wasn't that that stupid game that was coming out?
4142534	4144115	I remember some.
4144135	4146217	Isn't it like three panel dancing or something?
4146257	4146497	Yeah.
4147987	4148407	Whatever.
4148527	4148828	Yeah.
4150749	4160357	Yeah, I heard about it, but... You know, if I'm going to do any type of, like, three-panel dancing or anything like that, it's going to be, like, from Dance FM or something like that, or whatever that is.
4160597	4163139	I'm not at Dance FM.
4164000	4165602	Neon FM, that's what I meant.
4169885	4171266	My brain feels numb.
4171486	4171747	I know.
4172207	4174369	Ziggy, we got other people calling in, so I'm going to let you go.
4174429	4175490	Is there anything else you want to share with us?
4175510	4175830	That's all right.
4177463	4178787	Nothing much else.
4179148	4183119	Well, Kiki, thanks for being a loyal fan of ours for at least a year now.
4185646	4186507	Yeah, over a year.
4186527	4187708	You know what, you guys?
4187868	4189289	Here's something I gotta mention.
4189309	4191250	And, you know, I've been meaning to do this for a while.
4191330	4192571	Hold on, let me say goodbye to Siggy first.
4192591	4194273	Unless you're gonna say something to Siggy.
4194353	4194933	Is this to Siggy?
4195053	4196314	This is to everyone.
4196795	4198016	I got nothing much else to say.
4198236	4199697	Just happy 4th of July.
4200057	4200518	Thank you.
4200558	4201318	Have a good one, Siggy.
4201358	4201939	Thanks for supporting us.
4201959	4203220	Don't buy the crappy fireworks.
4203240	4204020	Stay cool.
4205902	4210946	Unless you live in the states that have the good... Let him say his piece.
4211046	4211646	I'm sorry, Siggy.
4212367	4212547	What?
4212607	4214529	I don't like fireworks anyway, so... Yeah.
4215550	4216390	Have a good one, Siggy.
4216430	4218612	I'm going to let you go, okay?
4218713	4219313	Bye, Siggy.
4219573	4220454	I'm very disappointed.
4220775	4224498	Other states other than California have really kick-ass fireworks.
4225159	4228342	We have these really shitty ones that burn out in 30 seconds.
4228722	4232145	But no, they get the ones with the actual mortars and...
4233416	4234337	Thank you for watching!
4259212	4260213	What was I going to say?
4260473	4261454	I don't know, I'm really drunk.
4262935	4263875	Then let's take another call.
4264636	4265216	Let's do that.
4265236	4267358	I'm going to drink some more.
4268158	4269199	I want to say hi to the caller.
4274082	4275543	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4276604	4278405	Hello, is this Sal's Pizza?
4278945	4281307	No, this is not Sal's Pizza.
4282188	4283709	Hey Sky, it's John Fields.
4283829	4285009	Hi John Fields, how are you?
4285030	4286811	What's on your mind?
4289502	4291363	Congratulations on making it to three years.
4311033	4311994	I'm always a bitch.
4312034	4317297	You guys were, let's see, you were back at the, at that apartment building, I believe.
4317457	4317677	Right.
4317717	4318058	Yeah.
4318378	4319058	The pink place.
4319178	4323361	And at that point, I don't think the machine had been started on by Loki yet.
4325343	4326783	I don't, no, I don't think it had been.
4328144	4331086	The time Jon was here, we had that old layout in the old studio.
4331286	4332127	Wow, you know what?
4332247	4333888	I need to play some more Final Fantasy.
4333928	4335629	It's been like way too much.
4335669	4336290	Let Jon talk.
4336310	4336370	Shh.
4338689	4339729	Both of you, both of you.
4340990	4341490	Sorry, John.
4341530	4342731	John, you may speak.
4344372	4349375	While I was there, if some of you remember, I actually stole Loki's library of songs and such.
4350976	4352377	I vaguely recall, yes.
4353197	4358961	I remember, didn't you take a tour of Tech TV when you were out here and you were talking about how awesome Tech TV was and then they got sold?
4359141	4362823	I did, and I was really upset when G4 brought them out.
4362843	4364084	Rob, get your fucking glasses over here.
4364625	4365645	Let the caller talk.
4366046	4371968	Sorry, Jamie is too busy thinking about drinking to be listening right now, but I am listening to you, John.
4372008	4374529	Tech TV got sold the next day and you were pissed.
4375930	4377671	It was more like a year, but yeah.
4378551	4380952	I was hoping to get a job there, but I guess not.
4381092	4382513	Did you say get a job with PETA?
4383129	4384030	No, it's G4.
4384471	4384691	Oh.
4385492	4386373	Actually, you know what's really funny?
4386413	4387274	This brings up a good point.
4387815	4390518	This is a good segue, because somebody's chatting with me in private message right now.
4390778	4392841	John, I don't mean to interrupt you, but you'll like this too.
4393241	4398247	Okay, DeepThought42 in our chat room, who I think might be a new listener.
4398287	4400510	I don't recognize the name, but then again, I'm drunk, so I apologize.
4400550	4401030	I don't either.
4401090	4403093	And you're talking, you've got the speaker way too loud.
4405174	4412218	DeepThought42 was saying that on attack of the show, I guess they're looking for co-hosts right now.
4412658	4416580	And he sent them an email saying that we should do it.
4418171	4420192	So I think the rest of you guys should send him an email.
4420432	4421913	Oh my god, that'd be awesome.
4421973	4426435	If you want to know where to send that email, ask DeepThought42, because he knows.
4427035	4429636	And send them an email saying that we should host.
4429976	4436379	Although seriously, what if he sent that email last week and now they're listening tonight and we're all just fucked up out of our minds?
4436820	4438500	They would totally are in.
4438620	4439481	No, no, no, no, no, no.
4440041	4446204	This is our opportunity that we can prove that we fit in in Hollywood because we can perform drunk or on drugs.
4446772	4448573	Dude, I am like... No, we don't do drugs.
4448593	4449093	I don't do drugs.
4449273	4450353	I don't do drugs.
4450533	4451734	Drugs are not cool.
4451754	4453815	I do Vicodin, but I'm on a prescription for Vicodin.
4453855	4462858	I don't do drugs because I can't swallow pills and have a phobia with needles, so the drugs are out of the picture, but alcohol is perfectly fine.
4464038	4464359	Awesome.
4464699	4465759	So anyway, I'm sorry, John.
4466279	4467400	Why did you call in anyway?
4467440	4468440	What's on your mind?
4468640	4469981	Well, I've got two things.
4470061	4470421	Okay.
4470501	4473302	First, I'd like to reflect on one of my favorite memories.
4473683	4484949	and that was actually when Karaoke Revolution first came out and Loki was singing, what was it, It's the End of the World and then also I'm Staying In or whatever it was.
4486229	4488110	That show was awesome.
4488310	4491012	It was I'm Staying In and it was, what was the other one?
4491132	4493513	I want to say it was Complicated or something.
4493573	4494954	Yeah, Complicated.
4495694	4498255	There's another one that Nellie was talking about yesterday.
4498416	4501177	It was, oh God, I don't remember the song.
4503303	4504846	Never mind, I'm not even going to remember it.
4505327	4514627	There was another song that she was singing that should be in Karaoke Revolution, and it was funny, but never mind, I can't remember it, so I'm not going to.
4515151	4519893	That was one of my favorite shows, too, because any time Loki makes an ass out of himself is a good show to me.
4519913	4523755	Well, you know, Karaoke Revolution Party Edition is going to be coming out in, I think, September.
4523775	4525696	We are all over that shit, too.
4525836	4526757	No, no, not September.
4526777	4527177	I'm sorry.
4527197	4528958	It would be November.
4530398	4533860	Actually, same day, I think, Ultramix 3 is coming out.
4533880	4537502	It would be November, I want to say, 23rd or something like that.
4538733	4543698	That's going to be when Karaoke Revolution Party Edition is going to be coming out for all three systems.
4546481	4547202	That's scary.
4548723	4554887	Okay, so I'm trying to find a clip of that episode where he's singing, but I'm so drunk I can't navigate my computer right now.
4555407	4557109	So I'll keep looking on it.
4557129	4558069	I'll find one on my computer.
4558089	4558790	I think I got one.
4558810	4559510	That'd be awesome.
4559530	4562852	Feels like someone shot Novocaine straight into my brain.
4562872	4566034	Somebody had it uploaded somewhere, so we gotta find that somewhere.
4566875	4573579	I only have... The only Loki sound clip I have is somewhere else.
4573639	4575441	I can't even... God, this is horrible.
4575701	4577482	Okay, what's your other thing you wanted to call it out, John?
4578396	4580298	Well, I need to make an announcement, actually.
4581199	4584521	As you all know, I am a huge Phantasy Star Online whore.
4585462	4590907	And after all the success that Red vs. Blue has had, I have decided to start my own machinima.
4592448	4595411	So you're going to do a Phantasy Star version of Red vs. Blue?
4595431	4598974	You have to play PSO on... Rob, turn the speaker down!
4598994	4602798	I'm sorry, that's the only way I can hear the Skype.
4602818	4603698	It's down, it's down.
4603999	4605480	You need to play PSO with me.
4608109	4608930	Okay, now I can hear.
4609610	4610130	Johnny there?
4610911	4611351	Yeah, I am.
4612372	4618055	Basically, it's really in the early production stages, but I've worked out how I'm going to make the camera work.
4619396	4627481	And at this point, I'm actually trying to figure out how to get the characters that aren't androids to actually move their mouths.
4628021	4635406	And I found someone that managed to do that, but he got a little scared after he saw how much work there was.
4636566	4641191	I'm going to post what he showed me in the chat room as well.
4641911	4649980	So if anybody wants to sign on and help make this a reality, I'm asking for any help I can get at this point.
4650080	4651221	John, more power to you.
4651241	4653984	Red vs. Blue is hilarious and PSO is a great game.
4654024	4656887	So any luck that you have with this, I think it would be awesome.
4657748	4662029	Plug away in our chat room and chatters, help John out because this is a good project.
4662449	4663089	Definitely.
4663229	4668451	I want to participate in this because I think that being the diva I am, I must be involved.
4668491	4671452	Well, and also, I mean, especially, I mean, look at Red vs. Blue.
4671492	4674632	They're basically now a spokesperson for like Halo and stuff.
4674672	4676093	I mean, that's awesome.
4676313	4678413	John, you could be the Sega spokesperson.
4678433	4680554	Would that just not make you a happy little fanboy or what?
4681414	4684396	Well, I applied to be a GM last year, but that didn't work out.
4684436	4685036	Oh my god.
4685076	4686097	That's close, I'm gonna get.
4686337	4686938	You know what?
4687138	4708372	I actually have a business card, or at least I had a business card, for a guy that was the Halo, or not the Halo, the 1008, so drunk, anyways, no, no, the Sega guy, um, that was the, um, I wanna say the production manager there at Sega, that they, um, I met them at, um, what was it, one of these, um,
4709403	4709583	and so on.
4730596	4733277	Let's see if I can find that card somewhere.
4733337	4733677	All right.
4734018	4738219	And I've actually spoken with one of the GMs already about this project, and he's really interested.
4738259	4741741	So hopefully I'll get the support of Sega behind me as well on this one.
4741761	4741981	Good.
4742141	4742901	John, make it happen.
4742921	4743641	You've got our support.
4743661	4745702	We'll plug it on the podcast or something.
4746242	4746522	All right.
4746843	4747403	All right, thank you.
4747423	4748183	Have a good one, John.
4748203	4749023	Thanks for calling in.
4749564	4751404	Okay, and once again, happy third anniversary.
4751524	4753625	Thank you, and thanks for supporting us over the past couple years.
4753645	4754226	We appreciate it.
4754966	4755206	Okay.
4755386	4756066	Have a super day.
4756867	4757407	All right, you too.
4757427	4757527	Later.
4757547	4757807	Later.
4758669	4761250	Hold on, I have that Loki sound clip, you guys.
4761650	4762710	God damn!
4763690	4764631	Ow, my foot!
4764671	4767231	Why did I shoot myself in my foot?
4767611	4769392	Oh my god, it hurts so bad!
4769792	4771112	I need that for walking!
4772493	4773553	No, my foot!
4773593	4774773	I need that for walking!
4776834	4783736	I just want to point out, somebody named Bomanikay just joined our chatroom, and I'm thinking, if you gave your computer to your sister,
4785427	4786928	She's not joining the chatroom.
4786948	4787728	She doesn't even know.
4787928	4788949	She's on dial-up.
4788989	4789569	Come on now.
4789769	4793831	Somebody named Bomanikay just joined the chatroom and says, Hi, Loki, we love you.
4796192	4797232	It's not her.
4797272	4797772	Trust me.
4799793	4801734	No, I said, is that Loki's sister?
4801774	4803775	And they said, yup, and family is listening.
4804776	4805616	She is not.
4806496	4807377	It is not her.
4807477	4808057	Trust me.
4808777	4811999	My family, first off, no, it's not even her.
4812019	4812339	Okay.
4813757	4816139	You are so screwed if that person's telling the truth.
4816239	4817079	It is not her!
4817680	4819020	They're telling me yes they do.
4819761	4821082	No, it's not my sister.
4821162	4824784	First off, okay, first off, she's on dial-up, okay?
4825124	4827586	That's for one.
4827826	4831909	And second, okay, she doesn't know how to use damn IRC anyway.
4832109	4832929	What if she learned?
4833510	4835531	She doesn't know how to use the internet?
4835611	4836432	Come on now!
4837372	4840155	She uses Juno to connect to the goddamn internet.
4840815	4844998	But Monty Cade, you've got to say something that only Loki would know.
4845199	4848661	And then I'm going to pee my pants laughing.
4848802	4849562	I will say it on air.
4849582	4852184	I am so drunk, I can't even see the chatroom.
4852284	4854146	It's just like a bunch of blurr.
4854906	4859350	I need to finish my drink and get another one.
4859650	4862312	They're not listening to me right now.
4862352	4864354	They have better things to be... They've been watching like...
4864634	4866174	You know, it's a movie or something.
4866214	4868135	They're not listening to my goddamn show.
4869715	4870815	I can't even... Okay.
4872096	4873276	Where is the money?
4873356	4874056	Loki, go sit down.
4874836	4877717	Mom, G-Ma, G-Pa, and Sis listening.
4882358	4882638	Oh, God.
4882978	4883718	I'm gonna cry.
4884138	4884738	Well, you know what?
4884758	4890299	That could be them because my grandma and grandpa are at my mom's house.
4890359	4891780	You are so screwy.
4896479	4898819	Well, if that's the case... Hello, family!
4899239	4901960	I am drinking right now, and I am... But he's being responsible.
4901980	4903201	He has a designated driver here.
4903221	4907302	I have a designated driver, and I am... And this is all a rating stunt.
4907362	4908342	Hey, DarkSakura, get this.
4908382	4910163	Loki's family is listening right now.
4911103	4912284	Designated driver three.
4914392	4914652	Ran-chan!
4914672	4915392	Ran-chan!
4915492	4916013	Ran-chan!
4916053	4916313	Ran-chan!
4943652	4945594	Yes, Rook-chan, what is it?
4948556	4950138	You are, you are tore up, aren't you?
4950298	4950558	No.
4951639	4951939	Liar.
4959245	4960426	I'm like so full.
4960547	4967332	I feel like I am full of food because I just ate like, you know, two meals and I've had about three or four drinks right now.
4967713	4968734	Wait, no, four drinks.
4969614	4970095	I think.
4972388	4983941	Hachi no nomimasu Wait, wait, wait, Loki Tudor train is the one you use to push in your power suit Oh my god
4992702	5000447	I have no idea why liquor is making me speak in Japanese.
5000527	5001248	I'm going to go get more.
5003109	5003889	Oh my god.
5003969	5004570	It's on your mind.
5005748	5008850	Hey, I just wanted to talk about the upcoming DOA movie real quick.
5009451	5010132	Oh, I'm sorry.
5010172	5011933	When are you going to come cosplay with me?
5012914	5015055	As soon as I get enough money to come out there.
5015836	5016537	Oh, okay.
5016597	5018498	Let Ranma talk about the Dead or Alive movie.
5018518	5018838	What's up?
5018858	5021921	You need to cosplay Manji for me so I can cosplay Rin.
5023122	5024283	I'll think about it, okay?
5026224	5029427	Okay, um... Okay, on the podcast... Hold on, hold on.
5029707	5033110	I can hear Loki ran outside to go tell... To go...
5034631	5042535	Loki walked outside to tell Nelly something in the living room because Nelly's the designated driver tonight and I can hear Nelly laughing all the way back here.
5043876	5045977	I'm going to go get more liquor and I'll be right back.
5046017	5046697	Ranma, what's on your mind?
5047458	5047818	Not much.
5048158	5050099	I want to talk about the DOA movie.
5050139	5050980	Yes, the DOA movie.
5051000	5051320	What's up?
5052020	5055222	The guy that's playing Ryu Hayabusa, Ken Kosugi.
5056002	5057563	Do you know who his father is?
5059604	5060164	I'm sorry, what?
5060184	5062466	Do you know who his father is?
5062566	5062886	No, who?
5064139	5070421	Sho Kasugi, he did all those ninja movies from the 80s, and he also helped put together Tenchu.
5071921	5073902	Wait, you cut out there, he also helped put together what?
5074622	5077883	He did the choreography for Tenchu, Stealth Assassins.
5078383	5078723	Awesome.
5079803	5085785	I just posted a link about that, so, this guy plays on everything, so you know what?
5086765	5089146	They got the perfect person to play Ryu, that's all.
5091310	5092371	That sounds awesome to me.
5092771	5096214	I'm looking forward to the Dead or Alive movie, even though I'm not a huge fan of the games.
5096634	5100817	But I'm really hoping they don't screw one of those movies up.
5101758	5102278	Same here.
5102518	5107842	Last I heard about the movie, which was back in 2000-2001, William Shatner was supposed to be a part of it.
5107922	5108702	Heck no.
5108822	5109543	Heck no.
5109843	5110824	I'm glad that didn't happen.
5111744	5112605	You ain't the only one.
5113706	5114126	Right on.
5114166	5115227	What else is on your mind, Ranma?
5116327	5116887	Not much.
5117108	5119169	I just went to a convention a couple of weeks back.
5119189	5123070	You know, we had fun, got drunk, orgy, you know, the normal chaos.
5123190	5123591	Hot!
5127633	5128793	We have Matt's parents listening.
5128893	5131654	Please don't say those types of things on air.
5131694	5132255	That's not good.
5133075	5133575	Like orgy?
5133996	5134896	Yeah, don't say that word.
5134976	5135636	That's a dirty word.
5136477	5137497	So I can't say orgy anymore?
5137537	5138077	No, you can't.
5138498	5139158	It's banned tonight.
5141997	5143579	I don't know if Loki's going to come back on air.
5143619	5144760	I think he's too embarrassed.
5145520	5146101	Oh, here he comes.
5146401	5149744	They are actually listening.
5149764	5150624	My purse is ringing.
5150804	5153567	Yes, they wanted to know where you went.
5156129	5158431	No, they are actually listening to this show.
5158691	5159712	They're all laughing at us.
5160412	5161213	Hold on, what, Nellie?
5162068	5166989	I said I have Matt's sister on the phone and his whole family is laughing at him right now.
5167369	5171790	Just think of this as a rite of passage.
5171850	5174571	This is something that every young man must go through.
5176351	5179131	When your mom finds out that you're a drunk on the internet.
5181012	5183812	I want a copy of this show.
5183852	5184933	We'll figure something out.
5185653	5186233	Please do that.
5188450	5189850	All right, Ranma, anything else on your mind?
5189870	5191331	Because we've got to go and make fun of Loki.
5191911	5192191	What?
5192971	5194712	Have a couple of drinks for me, okay?
5194792	5195172	Will do.
5195852	5196532	Have one for me.
5196652	5200673	I'm on number nine, and I've got to go to the potty so bad.
5200713	5201674	Give us a drink count.
5202554	5205015	I'm on nine, Loki's on, he's got a full glass.
5205035	5205715	I don't even know.
5205735	5206615	Is that seven and eight?
5206915	5208796	I think that's like nine and ten.
5209036	5210836	He's got another double shot, whatever that is.
5210996	5214177	And DarkSakura, what drink number are you on, for those keeping count at home?
5215137	5215478	Six.
5215718	5216738	She's putting up six fingers.
5217885	5220187	I can't believe that my family is listening to this.
5220207	5221388	This is crazy.
5221568	5226911	Well, the six is counting actual number of drinks, not counting shots.
5228553	5230054	Why are people listening to me?
5230134	5231475	I mean, that's so crazy.
5231635	5232535	Ranma, we gotta go.
5232555	5233676	Because you are fucking hilarious.
5233716	5234437	I know I am.
5234457	5235077	Take care, my friend.
5235698	5236038	Bye-bye.
5236078	5236378	Bye.
5238019	5239180	No, no, Ranchan can't go.
5239200	5240181	I already hung up on him.
5240201	5240541	I'm sorry.
5240661	5241882	Ranchan has to come back.
5242943	5243763	Well, what do you want to tell him?
5243783	5244224	He's listening.
5245825	5246085	Nothing.
5247116	5250100	Alright, so about those, you know, dancing games.
5251422	5253305	Ah, who fucking plays those anymore?
5256547	5268397	I have to go over to my mom's house tomorrow to actually do Fourth of July stuff.
5268597	5273841	We're actually outstanding citizens of the community and we do charity work and all that, don't we?
5274342	5274682	No.
5275262	5275983	I did charity work.
5276003	5277504	Okay, you can turn the speaker down now.
5277644	5278145	Okay, sorry.
5278305	5283549	All I got to say right now is for some reason my hand is numb and I don't know why that is.
5283629	5284650	My lips are numb.
5285365	5288466	And I have a full drink here, so I've got to finish that.
5289866	5290286	I don't know.
5291166	5293767	I mixed Loki a super yummy drink.
5293807	5295987	Thank God I have a designated driver.
5296287	5300248	Yes, again, boys and girls, if you are going to drink, have a designated driver.
5300608	5302029	We were model citizens.
5302049	5308050	No, no, no, no, you were wrong, DTE, because I have had six actual drinks.
5309258	5315460	I've had one, two beers, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
5316101	5318542	I have had ten shots, including my beers.
5319382	5319982	That's great.
5320062	5321963	I get to go face my family tomorrow.
5322143	5322583	That's awesome.
5322643	5323203	So fix it!
5326520	5328562	Thanks for watching!
5346514	5347735	All right, here you go.
5348816	5349177	Oh, man.
5349217	5351099	Now that you're not spilling it all over the damn kitchen.
5351219	5353401	I'm not spilling anything, okay?
5353761	5354462	It's actually pretty good.
5354502	5357085	You did, too, freaking spill it all over the damn kitchen.
5357105	5364532	Yeah, but... Because poor Exifer was down there with a towel on his hands and knees scrubbing up after your freaking...
5365393	5369155	SloshyLickerAss Listen, I brought the towel with me, okay?
5369175	5370316	I brought the paper towel with me.
5370336	5371776	You brought one with you.
5371836	5372517	Okay, okay, okay.
5372557	5372917	No, no, no.
5372977	5374037	Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck that.
5374878	5377959	You had the towel with you in here.
5378300	5380901	You were spilling freaking orange juice all over the goddamn floor.
5381221	5388525	And if orange juice left unchecked, it tends to mutate and collect dust buddies, which turn into a huge fucking mess.
5389385	5390566	Okie dokie.
5391186	5392387	So you, sir...
5393479	5399447	Build the orange juice on the floor And it's not for the valiant Can we move on?
5400329	5407519	I am not done It's not for the valiant efforts of your roommate, Rob Extifer
5407918	5408118	Yes.
5408739	5413383	There would be, you would be stepping in quagmire every time you entered the kitchen.
5414443	5416525	Something along the lines of my ex-partner.
5417446	5417986	Quagmire.
5418267	5423511	Can we, can we please... Hey, we should go... Ride green pong!
5423531	5426133	Your sister says, have fun, Orange Lounge.
5426273	5426894	Be safe.
5427174	5428175	Bye, your family.
5428275	5429055	See you on the 4th.
5431137	5433019	Why are they listening to this show?
5434144	5435346	Look at it this way.
5435426	5436327	Look at it this way.
5436347	5437309	Loki's family out there listening.
5447881	5451184	There are many, many worse things that Loki could be doing right now.
5451244	5452344	He doesn't do drugs.
5452625	5455007	He's a drug-free American citizen.
5455067	5457168	I only drink on pretty weekends.
5457188	5459730	He provides a service to the youth of America.
5460371	5462172	He teaches them to stay in school.
5463553	5463953	Right.
5464494	5466455	Yeah, if they don't want to end up like me.
5468837	5469177	All right.
5470714	5472715	I've really got to go to the bathroom.
5472755	5473955	So we're going to go to a cage match.
5474095	5476456	Okay, we're going to go to a cage match and then we'll come back and we'll take more time.
5476716	5480657	I won last week's win, win, win, win, win, win.
5480877	5482277	Win, win, win, win.
5482598	5483598	We're getting one more call.
5483858	5486139	This is from a new listener, so we'll go ahead and take this call.
5486699	5488699	Because we like it when new people call in.
5488719	5490880	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
5492080	5492540	Hey, what's up?
5492560	5493401	This is DeepThought42.
5493521	5496301	Ooh, you're very, very quiet on there, DeepThought42.
5496361	5498282	Is there any way you can talk into your microphone a little more?
5499419	5499779	Hold on.
5500120	5500340	Okay.
5501441	5502701	What should I hold on to?
5502721	5503602	A little, little bit.
5503702	5504182	Talk again.
5505503	5506164	Hold on one second.
5506464	5506684	Okay.
5507264	5508745	He's very, very quiet, boys and girls.
5508765	5509286	We're sorry.
5510046	5511987	It's always the quiet ones you gotta watch out for.
5512027	5514569	We can barely hear you, my friend.
5517611	5517951	Hello?
5517971	5523755	I think you might have turned off the... No, just give him a moment to adjust.
5525036	5526617	See, I can hear you just as loud as I can hear him.
5528394	5528834	Oh, that's right.
5529654	5533115	We'll give you a tip in the chat room, and then why don't you call us back after the cage match, alright?
5533455	5534175	Alright, thanks.
5534335	5534995	Alright, later.
5535236	5535576	Later.
5536476	5537556	I can hear myself on there.
5537576	5538216	That's kind of weird.
5538356	5539076	He's very quiet.
5539096	5540537	He's got a very low delay.
5540557	5541857	Turn the microphone down.
5541877	5542697	Sorry, I'm trying to get down.
5542837	5543777	You're giving me a freaking headache.
5543797	5544218	Wow.
5544258	5546638	He's got a very small delay, though.
5546658	5549419	Yeah, he must have a fast... He has to be near to us.
5549479	5553199	He must have a fast internet connection, so... Everything's spinning.
5553260	5555220	That's... fun.
5556292	5556752	You know what?
5556772	5557592	You're fucked up.
5557752	5559493	And I'm, like, not even half there.
5560093	5560553	So, whatever.
5560573	5561213	No, that's okay.
5561594	5562954	I still have to finish my drink.
5562994	5567995	Because I need to save room in my liquor tolerance for the club tonight, so I can get my hoe on.
5568035	5576818	I think this is the most drunk-ness I've been, you know, because honestly, when I was at my San Diego... I'm already sobering up, so it doesn't even matter.
5576838	5584260	When I was at my San Diego event, you know, I thought I was pretty drunk, but this is pretty bad, because, I mean, like, I actually feel like I'm gonna, like, fall over and just
5587255	5592917	We really need to go to a cage match, kids, because I've got to pee, or I'm going to pee my pants right here in the studio, and you don't want that.
5592937	5595038	I brought my, um, zip drive here.
5595078	5596659	Here we go, let's stop tonight's cage match.
5597999	5598759	There it is.
5598819	5599280	I love Kotaku!
5603855	5604355	Alex!
5604415	5609077	The way the case works, three songs we're going to play for you guys.
5609297	5610338	We're going to play for you guys.
5610358	5619562	You get to vote for your favorite, and the winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio Live's Milani Music and More program, which plays 24 hours a day, 70 days a week.
5619782	5621803	So basically, we're going to play three songs to vote for your favorite.
5621863	5623624	That's how it works.
5623704	5624684	It's totally you guys.
5624704	5625444	You guys get control.
5625504	5626945	And I know we have new listeners tonight.
5627165	5628806	Only votes for Loki count.
5629626	5630847	No, shh, don't tell them that.
5630927	5637491	Alright, so you only get to hear a clip of the song that won from last week, because you already heard it last week.
5637591	5643714	Even though I know we have new listeners tonight, thanks to the great Apple, we're only playing a clip.
5644074	5645175	And I'm so gone.
5645215	5648337	Loki, you are so freaking drunk right now, it's not even funny.
5649237	5653480	Ah, no, no, no, no, no, he's not, I have to make him the mother of all drinks.
5653920	5658004	Remember, you cannot vote until all three songs have played in their entirety.
5658024	5661066	I feel sorry for Christopher's desk, because it's probably getting messed up for me.
5661247	5662267	Here we go.
5662508	5664950	Song number one, it's last week's winner.
5665130	5667992	Or two weeks ago, really, because we didn't have a show last week.
5668032	5671956	DarkSakura picked Del the Funky Homo Sapien with Dr. Bombay.
5672336	5673898	That's because that song's fucking awesome.
5673918	5674919	So see if you like it.
5674959	5675679	Here's the clip.
5675779	5677180	Song number one you can vote for tonight.
5677241	5679823	Del the Funky Homo Sapien, Dr. Bombay.
5817657	5825361	And get up off your knees, everything that Dr. Bombay says It's guaranteed to make you say, so who's the side to hit?
5825441	5846490	I like little men hanging out with the damn thing Girl, if you ain't got a turn, I won't hesitate to pull out my funky ones But if you ain't down for jump on, cancel your appointment and please get the hell on Cause I won't have fun with fools under my nose if you want 80 feet to close Get out my way so I can save the day, cause I'm Dr. Bombay
5885467	5887651	Yo, that was song number one.
5887691	5889053	Song number one tonight's cage match.
5889373	5890155	Dell the Funky.
5892659	5893860	We're talking about Del!
5894080	5896662	Del the Funky Homo Sapien with Dr. Bombay.
5896942	5898223	Rob is done with his pee.
5898403	5899984	I had to take the biggest pee, you guys.
5900564	5901685	I don't even know if I flushed.
5901725	5902365	I was so drunk.
5902405	5902806	No, I did.
5902926	5903526	I did, kids.
5903586	5904146	I'm sanitary.
5904607	5904907	Alright.
5906308	5909330	So it's Del the Funky Homo Sapien with Dr. Bombay.
5909430	5910471	So see if you like that one.
5910491	5911271	Here's song number two.
5911351	5913112	Song number two tonight is my pick.
5913593	5915674	And you might remember last week we announced
5915774	5916114	Are you Elijah?
5941283	5944346	It's so precious!
5944786	5948329	Alright, so I wanted to play an azoic song for you guys, because it's kind of gothy.
5948489	5948969	I like it.
5949250	5949930	I like this band.
5950050	5950931	It's so too gothy.
5951151	5952892	It's gothy, and we're going to the gothy club tonight.
5953053	5954093	I gotta find something to wear, though.
5954474	5955134	So anyway, here it is.
5956035	5956515	Should I wear this?
5956535	5957997	I am as real as this!
5958537	5959598	Alright, here we go.
5959698	5960979	It's so sorrow!
5961059	5964022	Song number two tonight, the azoic, Let Me Tell You Something.
5964062	5964282	Enjoy.
5997760	5999181	Thanks for watching!
6043888	6045929	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft,
6113174	6115616	Thank you for watching!
6161923	6162984	Thank you for watching.
6163124	6163824	See you next time.
6190200	6194986	Come get to me Let me tell you something That won't be pushed around
6251846	6254527	Song number two, The Ezoic, Let Me Tell You Something.
6254927	6258809	And let me tell you, I don't know if these two heard much of that song, but they'll give it a rating anyway.
6258849	6259729	DarkSakura.
6261510	6263671	It's the same fucking stuff you always pick.
6264631	6265852	I don't, I think you're wrong.
6265952	6266612	I think it's different.
6266692	6272695	Tindy voice, tindy voice and trance, over generic beat, trance.
6272755	6275636	I think if you put that side by side with my previous picks, the song's very different.
6275996	6277357	It's actually okay and I give it a seven.
6278257	6280098	Loki, she just wanted to make fun of me.
6280758	6283674	I'll give it a 9 because
6284961	6289164	I wasn't here to listen to it, but it sounds great.
6289684	6291446	This is the drunkest I've ever seen Loki.
6291906	6292907	I'm gonna make him drunk.
6292987	6295128	I could have played Britney Spears and that would have gotten a 9.
6295428	6297410	I didn't even know what the hell you played.
6297770	6299171	It's gonna get a 9, though.
6299251	6300932	It's the Azoic, let me tell you something.
6301153	6301913	Azoic is good.
6302053	6306216	I was listening to the different drum stuff earlier today when I was trying to find something to play.
6306857	6309999	But, um, Azoic is good, so I'll give you a 9.
6310399	6311500	Because Azoic rocks.
6311980	6314060	and I give that song eleventy billion.
6314521	6315541	Eleventy billion!
6316061	6316861	I second that.
6316941	6318201	Eleventy billion is good.
6318301	6319882	Eleventy billion for the Ezoic.
6320182	6321042	Eleventy billion.
6321462	6323522	Honestly, Ezoic needs more stuff.
6323563	6334925	There's actually, there's another group that I need, um, music from, but they only had one minute samplers on their site, and it begins with an E, but I can't remember the goddamn name of the stupid band.
6336645	6337005	Emo?
6337706	6338566	No, it's not Emo.
6338646	6339146	It's, um...
6340447	6340808	All right.
6341148	6341609	Something else.
6341689	6342190	Who cares?
6342611	6343292	Song number three.
6343613	6344053	Your pick.
6344174	6345215	What'd you pick for us, Loki?
6346077	6350324	Something from Every Little Thing is from ELT Trance.
6351721	6352941	I can't remember what the guy's name is.
6352961	6355802	It's called Feel My Heart, the Mugwai Remix.
6355842	6361184	Yeah, Feel My Heart, the Mugwai Remix, and it was just kind of cool sounding from what I had.
6361684	6380230	I had another ELT Trance song that was kind of rock sounding, but it wasn't good enough, so I picked this one, and honestly, right now, I am in no condition to say how good the song was, but I think it was pretty good, so take a listen and enjoy.
6381658	6382420	I might throw up.
6382500	6383283	This isn't good.
6383503	6384245	Alright, here we go.
6384586	6385910	Song number three, every little thing.
6386210	6386952	Woo!
6387213	6387474	Woo!
6478533	6479695	Thanks for watching!
6522506	6523487	Thank you for watching!
6584481	6585322	Thank you for watching!
6623393	6630915	Song number three in tonight's cage match, Every Little Thing, Feel My Heart, the Mugwai remix.
6632235	6637157	Let's see what our people in the room thought about Every Little Thing, Feel My Heart.
6637997	6639457	DarkSakura, Every Little Thing.
6639657	6639978	Two.
6640938	6641438	Why is that?
6646423	6653491	I give it a, um, I don't know, a five?
6654271	6657515	I don't really know because I wasn't listening to it because I was drunk.
6659285	6666128	Um, the parts I heard sounded neat, but you guys are giving it really low scores, I wouldn't have given it low scores.
6666148	6674451	It was a pretty good song, I mean, I liked it when I originally picked it out when I was sober, and it was good, okay, that was pretty good.
6674791	6678413	The original song I had picked out wasn't quite as good, so I'll give it an 8.
6679778	6689102	But, um, right now, you could play it like, you know, a cat in heat, you know, a sound effect of that, and I would probably give it a 10.
6689282	6689582	Right.
6689622	6691123	Because I'm just so gone.
6691143	6695165	Well, I'll combine 2 plus 5 and give it a 7, because I kind of like that.
6695265	6696205	Okay.
6696485	6699587	Alright, let's listen to three songs you can vote for tonight.
6699907	6700647	Uh, here it is.
6700967	6704289	Song number one you can vote for tonight, Del the Funky Homo Sapien.
6704309	6705929	We played three songs already?
6705949	6706890	Yeah, it's already done.
6707150	6709311	Del the Funky Homo Sapien, Dr. Bombay.
6717330	6719832	Every time I hear that song, I can't help but think, check and turn.
6721714	6723255	Here it is, song number two tonight.
6723535	6724777	Zoic, Let Me Tell You Something.
6733364	6739269	And song number three you can vote for tonight, Every Little Thing, Feel My Heart, the Mugwai remix.
6742332	6744814	I hope they're not dragging me out of here tonight.
6746533	6748775	Place vote now.
6748915	6754298	Send a private message to Sky in the chatroom with your vote and we'll tally them up.
6754358	6755840	And hopefully I can keep count tonight.
6756840	6757681	We'll tally them up.
6758061	6763985	Please don't post a vote publicly because I don't see those as easily and then I don't tabulate it.
6764105	6766427	And that's no fun at all when I can't tabulate your vote.
6767047	6769369	So, how's it going there, Sky?
6770610	6771510	I'm feeling okay.
6771631	6773432	I'm just... I'm a little...
6774862	6781684	I have no sense of balance right now and I'm pretty drunk, I think.
6782464	6783004	Yeah, me too.
6783324	6784644	I'm pretty out of it.
6785345	6790746	I can't focus on you right now, man, because you're all over the place.
6792566	6796567	And yeah, I think my family stopped listening, so that's good.
6796587	6797447	That's probably a good thing.
6797528	6798728	That's probably a good thing.
6799568	6803349	And I'm sure I'll get much crap for it tomorrow, but you know what?
6804226	6808637	I don't care because I'm having a barbecue and it's free food and you know what?
6809580	6810221	That's all good.
6813570	6815492	I am so dizzy right now.
6816413	6819536	I know, I honestly am at the point where I'm like, what do I do with the rest of the show?
6819617	6824101	Like, I could literally run into the wall and I wouldn't feel it because I'm so numb right now.
6824221	6825663	I was hugging the corner earlier.
6825703	6827905	I don't know why, I just felt very comfortable in my head.
6828346	6830108	My head rested very well in the corner.
6830128	6831169	It was very interesting.
6831189	6832070	Yeah, I saw that.
6832290	6832890	I saw that.
6833351	6836094	And people were saying, you know, you're so drunk.
6837667	6843772	Honestly, folks, I am pretty drunk, but I am still pretty coherent.
6843992	6852378	I just have no sense of balance whatsoever right now in most of my... Whoa, we're getting feedback, but we're going to try and take this call.
6852419	6853199	Hi, you're on Orange House Radio.
6855290	6855670	Sorry about that.
6855690	6856230	Can you hear me now?
6856530	6856751	Yes.
6858651	6859311	It's DeepFell42.
6859331	6860672	Sorry about that earlier.
6861072	6861512	That's all right.
6861532	6862112	What's on your mind?
6862152	6865854	We're hearing a bad echo, so I'm just going to give you a minute to put out your thoughts.
6865894	6867874	That was because I forgot to turn my iTunes volume down.
6868935	6870535	So that was the main reason of that.
6871876	6872336	What's on your mind?
6872376	6872956	What's on your mind?
6873376	6881699	No, I just wanted to let you guys know that if you go to KevinPereira.com, I wanted to let you know how to vote for you guys for Attack of the Show.
6882599	6882819	Awesome.
6883019	6884800	If you go to KevinPereira.com
6885786	6914377	he has a private webcast called Attack of the Webcast sorry, Attack of the Podcast the ingenious clever man that he is naming it that so if you go on and that's where I heard about it if you guys go on to attackoftheshow.com if you go on to their comment section you can fill out comments and how to improve the show and just tell them I just told them that these guys have this great you know
6914892	6915692	I really appreciate it.
6915752	6916152	I'm so grateful.
6943701	6956712	So, I mean, just, I mean, so, everybody go to, well, first of all, if you want to go to Kevin Pereira's Self-Indulgent Crap, just go on to, I think his podcast is registered with iTunes as well.
6957232	6966980	It's called Attack of the Podcast, and you guys would, you guys just would be so awesome, because ever since it went to Attack of the Show, it's been crap.
6967460	6970943	Sorry, we weren't listening to you so much that break, because Jamie was modeling for us.
6970963	6971564	She was so weird.
6975284	6976465	Where's the webcam for that?
6976825	6977865	She was just here.
6977885	6980265	I don't know if I might have caught a screenshot.
6980305	6982226	I don't know.
6983766	6988267	We're getting really bad echo, so I've got to let you go, but thank you so much for your support.
6988727	6989247	You know what?
6989888	6990348	That's all right.
6990368	6990648	Take care.
6990668	6991968	Keep up the good work, all right?
6992068	6992488	All right.
6992548	6993668	Have a good one.
6993849	6994249	You too.
6994469	6994729	All right.
6994749	6995189	Bye-bye.
6995309	6995869	Bye-bye.
6996049	7000070	I'm pulling this at the end of my drinking binge right here.
7000310	7002451	This drink is the last one.
7002611	7004613	I'm drinking water from here on out, man.
7022263	7024785	I'm so dizzy right now.
7024925	7028508	Everything's spinning around and around.
7028709	7030570	It's just not even funny.
7030630	7038457	And I'm walking out there, my limbs are numb, my hands are numb, my feet are numb, my lips are numb.
7038597	7042600	It's just walking out there, stumbling around like a complete idiot.
7043321	7044221	It's not even funny.
7044301	7048525	But honestly, folks, Destroy All Humans, awesome game.
7048785	7049586	You can play that game.
7050962	7053503	Okay, we're going to go to a break, boys and girls.
7053803	7055244	Let's do the podcast!
7055384	7057205	No, we can't do the podcast yet.
7057245	7058865	The podcast is in another hour.
7058885	7060266	Okay, fine.
7061286	7062347	Whee!
7063567	7070790	Okay, we're going to go to a break, and in this break we're going to hear some guitar freaks, drum mania stuff, because I'm going to eat the microphone.
7071314	7072414	That's going to be fun.
7072755	7074555	Jamie looked good in her skirt, didn't she?
7074575	7075596	Where did she go?
7075816	7080518	She went to the bathroom because she doesn't think she looks good, but she does.
7080758	7080978	Why?
7081058	7082239	She looks incredible.
7082259	7082459	She does.
7082479	7083039	She looks fine.
7083959	7084660	I'm sorry.
7084700	7087261	I'm just like drunk, so I think everyone looks hot.
7090022	7090782	Jamie!
7091403	7092243	Jamie!
7092583	7093423	Where did you go?
7093544	7095444	I think she's yelling at us, so we better go to break.
7095464	7096165	I think I need a drink.
7096805	7098125	No, you better not have any more drinks.
7098145	7098426	Why?
7098446	7098926	Why?
7100475	7101975	Don't hold me back.
7102796	7103436	Break time.
7103936	7104656	No!
7104816	7106517	Yes, we'll be back after this break.
7106557	7107737	We're going to tally up the cage match votes.
7107957	7108437	So hurry up.
7108497	7109598	Last call for cage match votes.
7109618	7113659	Thank God there's no karaoke revolution now because I don't want to sing.
7113779	7115640	Starting off with Stop Spinning Me in Circles.
7115700	7116140	We'll be back.
7116360	7117980	I'm spinning myself.
7121361	7123282	You've got to tell me what you want.
7147905	7148612	Thanks for watching!
7197717	7198772	Thanks for watching!
7227353	7228914	Thank you for watching!
7263617	7264938	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
7292825	7293867	Thank you for watching!
7391888	7392749	It's great, man!
7439376	7457986	Party after party, beauty and money, we were so desperate for perfection But you have made me feel so good, I've only been closer to you I close my eyes, and your love is simple again
7477354	7479535	Last week on Orange Lounge Radio.
7479655	7485037	Next week on the show we're going to have our very first special guest.
7505199	7514269	We're actually having over Melody and Melby, and they're going to be our guests on the show, and I get to clean house all week to be ready for them.
7515170	7515551	Oh, God.
7516071	7519815	I have to move everything out and deliver, because this room's cramped as it is when we do the show here.
7520056	7522719	I'd have to say so, and quite dirty and moist.
7523940	7525542	Are you feeling a little moist tonight, Jamie?
7526351	7527511	Oh, every night on the show.
7531233	7532693	As Irene makes us say.
7533173	7536115	Orange Lounge Radio makes you moist as a snack.
7536175	7538976	Join us every Sunday night from 7 p.m.
7539116	7540096	until 9 p.m.
7540136	7549919	Pacific Standard Time for the Orange Lounge with your hosts, DarkSakura and Sky, where we'll talk about all things Bomani and then some.
7550380	7553841	In the meantime, enjoy our Bomani Music and More program.
7554798	7562142	Another flashback there, an old episode, I don't know, that's like episode 5 or something, I don't know, it's old, it's hecka old.
7563022	7574749	We're back here on Orange Lounge Radio, and I've been doing a little bit of drinking, and I'm cut off now, and I think Loki is stuck with water now, and DarkSakura, how you doing?
7574769	7578311	I would love the chat room forever if they tell me how to take those damn ink tags off my clothes.
7579813	7580874	That's a bunch of crap.
7580894	7582535	Fucking Hot Topic fucked up.
7582675	7586879	I can never figure out how you were able to get out of Hot Topic with the tag on.
7586899	7588600	Because wouldn't it have beeped?
7589101	7589521	Should have.
7589921	7590602	Logically.
7590802	7592323	But now you know how to steal clothes.
7592824	7593564	And maybe you should.
7593845	7595066	Just to teach them a lesson.
7595266	7595386	No.
7599627	7605090	DarkSakura is sounding a little angsty to me, so I think we need to get in the FUs of the week.
7605150	7608152	However, I do want to announce tonight's cage match winner.
7608492	7611833	But we didn't have a lot of votes in tonight's cage match, which makes me a sad panda.
7612074	7613594	Doesn't that make you sad a little bit?
7614115	7614475	A little.
7615035	7619517	But we do have a winner nonetheless, because even if there's one vote, one vote is enough to declare the cage match.
7619537	7622439	So here is tonight's cage match wiener.
7623799	7624800	The wiener is...
7626704	7630166	TheOzoic, let me tell you something.
7630746	7635229	By one vote, one vote for TheOzoic wins tonight's cage match.
7635269	7636410	Good job, boys and girls.
7637510	7637971	Alright.
7641193	7645255	DarkSakura, I think you're wanting to get your angst on, aren't you?
7646445	7647006	Hot Topic Sucks
7669698	7673940	So I caught topic for leaving the ink tag on my damn skirt that I was going to wear tonight.
7674300	7677381	So now I have to find something to wrap the ink tag in while I cut the wire.
7678541	7678881	That's all.
7680042	7680502	That's it?
7682502	7682923	That's it.
7683823	7684183	Okay.
7686504	7689105	Hold on, I've got to find Loki's music here.
7689145	7689565	Here it is.
7690485	7691325	Loki, your turn.
7693026	7694907	Chat room, you can send in your FUs right now if you want.
7694947	7695827	Loki, here you go, your turn.
7697608	7706890	The only thing I'm really mad about is how drunk I am, because I felt like I was going to throw up something in the bathroom, but I didn't.
7708030	7710651	Thank God I'm not that drunk yet, so.
7713391	7721073	Just F you to how drunk I am, and fuck you to Destroy All Humans, it's been such a short game.
7722313	7725194	And, uh, that's it.
7727293	7727733	Alright.
7728754	7730976	Continue with whoever else is next.
7731236	7733577	You can cut in the bathtub, just in case.
7734598	7734958	Okay.
7735799	7736459	I'm fine.
7736499	7738000	I'm just very dizzy.
7739381	7739681	Are you okay?
7739701	7740522	Are you gonna pass out?
7741323	7741983	No, I'm fine.
7743184	7746346	I felt like I was gonna throw up earlier, but I didn't, so it's good.
7747166	7748027	You're not angsty?
7749148	7750249	I'm very drunk.
7750389	7755272	Like, I don't have the energy to be angsty, so... It's good.
7757606	7757947	Manama!
7757967	7758367	Manama!
7759870	7760490	Manama!
7772685	7776488	I can't find my song, that's why I'm stalling.
7776548	7777949	Are you sure you don't have anything else?
7778470	7780792	Yeah, I'm pretty sure.
7780812	7792601	The only thing I have is why the hell did my family decide to listen to this show now when I'm drunk instead of like normally when I'm doing a normal show.
7793922	7808867	I don't understand that kind of stuff, but whatever, you know, they know I'm drunk and I know they know that I'm not normally drunk, so I am way wasted right now.
7810447	7812988	I am so dizzy it's not even funny.
7815789	7816469	Manamana.
7819790	7820911	Manamana.
7821571	7821891	Any luck?
7824656	7827678	I can't even see you people because you're so damn drunk.
7832099	7835040	The chat room is noticing how slow your speech got all of a sudden.
7835300	7836341	How many drinks did you have again?
7838682	7841002	Four double shots.
7841022	7846404	I think it's empty.
7847565	7848285	Oh my god.
7848405	7848925	My turn.
7849205	7849605	Shut up, Loki.
7849665	7850066	It's my turn.
7850406	7850606	Sorry.
7857826	7864810	Um, I'm giving you an F you to the motherfucker who broke into my car for the second time nonetheless.
7865350	7866771	Fool me once, shame on you.
7866831	7868052	Fool me twice, shame on me.
7868132	7868812	I hate you.
7869313	7870693	Why did you have to do that to me?
7870894	7872014	I am a nice guy.
7872054	7874135	A nice guy should not have the car broken into.
7874215	7874936	And just...
7875775	7882617	F you to the fact that I didn't have a car alarm, but I shouldn't have to get an alarm, because people should have the common fucking decency not to break into your shit.
7883217	7892859	I hope you enjoy the stereo, I hope it blows up on you, and I hope you get gonorrhea and die of SARS, because you're just an asshole who steals things from people, who steals things that aren't yours.
7893600	7899741	And now I'm gonna have to rent a garage because of you, and that's $70 a month, I'm out the money, because you can't keep your hands off my shit.
7900021	7902362	Keep your hands off my shit, you shit-eater!
7904699	7907361	And yeah, an FU to that.
7908722	7911104	Alright, let's go to the chatroom FUs.
7915847	7921251	Dark Knight says, my FU is going to be for my job to have me work on the 4th, bitches.
7926274	7931197	Dark Knight says, if it's a certain tag, all you need to do is pinch one of the tags.
7931678	7933059	So get like a pair of pliers.
7935430	7942578	Okay, the way that this one is, it's got the clear tag with the blue ink and the yellow ink.
7942738	7944059	You can see through the tag.
7944440	7949585	The other side has a long part that's attached to a more cylindrical looking part with a domed end.
7950185	7953008	You can see a thin wire connecting the two.
7953769	7963995	What I am concerned about is that without having anything to wrap it in, if I cut the wire because it is magnetically charged, at the point it senses the magnetic disruption, it will explode the ink.
7964676	7965756	I have nothing to wrap it in.
7967537	7968818	So yeah, find me a way around that.
7973921	7976503	Illusion says F you to Loki and his slurred speech.
7983756	7984576	Uh, where else are we?
7985357	7990681	Uh, Chimera says, F you to swimming at... Chimera says, F you to... I'm drunk.
7991062	7993183	F you to swimming at 6 in the goddamn morning.
7995025	7995385	You okay?
7995445	7995886	Loki!
7996726	7997207	You okay?
7997627	7999168	Loki just fell on the floor.
7999709	8000129	Is he okay?
8000149	8000790	Should I just leave him?
8002891	8003212	Alright.
8006167	8032937	Aguanagirl says, my F you is too emotion, and I don't think this is the song either I've had a horribly emotional week, finally got my cry on this afternoon, so I'm feeling better, but yeah Fuck you to everything hitting you all at once to where you feel piled on top of with drama Ranchan says, F you to New York State, you fucker owe me an unemployment check
8035202	8039285	DarkTetsuya says, seconded on the F you to the bastards who broke into your car.
8039686	8041547	Same thing happened to my mom some years ago.
8044370	8051095	Illusion says, F you to my Target interview sucking and me being pretty sure I didn't get the job.
8053417	8060183	VidPalace says, F you to homework over holiday weekends and F you to my DVD case being cracked in the mail.
8061775	8068777	and DeepThought42 says, F you to the Hillary Clinton for saying that video games are to blame for your kids' sociopathic behavior.
8068837	8070657	It's your fucking parents' fault!
8071458	8072298	Damn straight.
8077059	8077579	And that's it.
8078600	8080360	That's our chatter's F yous.
8080420	8081500	They're kind of anxious.
8081640	8082321	Is he okay?
8082341	8084601	I don't know.
8084841	8088142	This is the first time, this is probably the only time he's going to bow down to your feet, though.
8088782	8089182	Hey!
8090983	8091123	I'm
8091798	8093939	Perfectly fine.
8099702	8102543	I really don't know what to do with the rest of the show, boys and girls.
8102903	8104304	I can entertain people, I'm sober.
8104564	8106665	Nellie, what do you want to do to entertain our listeners?
8107486	8109046	Um, I don't know.
8109627	8111468	Let's hear some Matt's wisdom.
8111948	8113028	Matt's drunken wisdom.
8113809	8114069	Burp.
8114689	8117751	I'm so tired.
8119531	8119952	Whew.
8122285	8123966	Oh, DeepThought42 had another one.
8124146	8127288	F you to my fucking computer for causing that fucking echo on the air.
8128689	8129049	Amen.
8131171	8132091	Where did Extifer go?
8132131	8133953	Don't kick him in the butt when he's passed out.
8133973	8134653	That's not nice.
8134673	8135253	Don't fall asleep.
8135394	8138115	I'm not falling asleep.
8138255	8141878	I'm just tired.
8148115	8150036	I really don't know what to do with the show at this point.
8150837	8152858	Let's go to a break.
8153078	8155860	That's always a good thing to do when the show is going crazy.
8156660	8159482	My stomach is full of... Almohal.
8160662	8161183	Almohal?
8162303	8163184	Loki is rambling.
8163704	8166266	We're going to give Loki some time to cheer up.
8166646	8168427	DarkSakura, you said you wanted to hear something earlier.
8168447	8168927	What do you want to hear?
8169147	8169527	I forgot.
8170628	8172409	Well, anything off the top of your head?
8173513	8173853	Taku.
8174393	8174854	Taku.
8176314	8178055	Voltage by the one and only Taku.
8178095	8178415	How's that?
8179495	8179855	It works.
8180175	8180476	All right.
8180916	8181736	Some 2DX then.
8181756	8183537	We'll do a 2DX break.
8183797	8186258	We'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.
8186298	8187358	Maybe some Ask Orange Lounge.
8187658	8188699	Whatever we can come up with.
8188799	8189259	We'll be back.
8289560	8290401	Thanks for watching!
8314351	8314972	Thanks for watching!
8398021	8399802	Stand by your friends who's wild
8431998	8433279	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
8470206	8474868	Thanks for watching!
8534936	8536101	Thank you for watching!
8591875	8594656	Last week on Orange Lounge Radio.
8616247	8620368	It's like, is that trying to spin off on Iron Chef, like Iron 2DX?
8621148	8624109	I don't know, it's like Tekken for 2DX.
8624929	8626429	You know, the king of iron fingering.
8627589	8628290	Whoa!
8629190	8632210	Never mind, I said another... Remember that part about adult content?
8634571	8638792	I was referring to this in a completely innocent manner, you pervert.
8640447	8641548	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
8667426	8669087	Another classic bite there.
8670368	8670768	Yes?
8673009	8673389	Yes.
8674270	8681213	Okay, we just had an incident in the studio, so we needed to do one more song, guys, and we'll explain what's going on when we come back.
8681433	8683955	Because I've got to run and get something real quick.
8684755	8686336	We'll explain what's going on when we come back.
8688877	8690438	How are you doing over there, DarkSakura?
8691538	8692459	I'm almost sober again.
8694352	8697415	You know my tolerance, and you know how fucking much it takes me.
8697435	8700498	What just happened surprisingly sobered me up, especially.
8700598	8701639	So we'll be back right after this.
8701699	8702700	I just sat here going, wow.
8704462	8707485	We'll be back right after this song from Extreme USA with more Orange Lounge.
8724347	8725829	Thank you for watching!
8746869	8747690	Love, love, love
8771680	8783466	Simply Be In Love Simply Be In Love Simply Be In Love Simply Be In Love Simply Be In Love Simply Be In Love Simply Be In Love
8800117	8811561	All right, we're back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
8811601	8814422	That was BT, Simply Being Loved.
8816143	8819865	Yeah, so, gosh, how do we explain this?
8821245	8823706	Basically what happened during the last break there... Loki puked!
8823846	8825527	Yeah, basically Loki farted.
8827087	8827628	On his pants.
8827648	8829068	He didn't quite make it to the toilet.
8829088	8830029	He just kind of sat there.
8830049	8831970	He just sat there and said, oh, bleh.
8832110	8834251	And then suddenly he was like, I have an announcement.
8834451	8834872	Bleh.
8836593	8837533	So we're not sure.
8837593	8839314	There's one more spot that needs to be wiped up, too.
8839974	8842216	So... I hope not.
8842596	8845217	So he's being addressed by Nellie right now.
8845518	8848019	Surprisingly, that sobered me up to have that happen.
8848159	8850781	I've been sitting here sober for the past 10, 15 minutes.
8850801	8850841	So...
8855136	8857078	I'm wearing my skirt with the tag tonight.
8858920	8860222	I'm going to fucking be hot if it kills me.
8860242	8861223	Girl, you are already hot.
8874577	8876698	We still have a podcast we got to do after this.
8876878	8877998	I don't know what we're going to do.
8879739	8881399	The final drink count.
8881499	8883160	What is tonight's final drink count?
8883560	8885201	How much did you have to drink, DarkSakura?
8887081	8887521	Ten shots.
8888122	8893003	I think I finished off with a nine because I had eight shots of Malibu and then a Guinness, which counts as one shot.
8893023	8894504	Loki had ten shots, but he puked.
8895124	8895704	Loki had how much?
8896104	8896324	Ten.
8896504	8897085	Ten, but he puked.
8897105	8897825	But I'm sober.
8899105	8903967	If I had had one more shot, I probably would have puked because I was at that point where I was like, I'm going to barf, but I didn't.
8904528	8913093	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
8929771	8931492	One of them you passed out in my bed.
8931592	8932432	I didn't pass out.
8932712	8934812	Remember, I was making commentary from your bedroom.
8935313	8938973	That's the closest that we've had to a barfing experience.
8939174	8940454	I did not pass out, however.
8941834	8944075	Do you remember I was screaming at you from your bedroom?
8944355	8945035	I vaguely remember.
8945055	8945715	That was the same episode.
8945735	8948456	And then I went, Waffle!
8948876	8954537	That was the same episode where I was kicking the wall, running up and down, yelling, I'm in the Matrix, I'm in the Matrix.
8955598	8956358	That was great.
8957179	8957739	Did it happen again?
8957759	8958420	Are you okay?
8958700	8959640	I thought you were sober.
8959700	8960520	You don't look sober.
8961301	8964222	Loki, keep... Okay, I'm going to get Loki some cookies.
8964302	8965282	Loki, pick up the microphone.
8965623	8966563	Can you pick up the microphone down there?
8968284	8969304	I thought he was sobering up.
8969344	8970084	He looks drunker.
8970445	8970765	Hello?
8971885	8973046	Tell the charm how you're feeling.
8973966	8976347	I'm feeling incredibly dizzy.
8977187	8979548	And I think I just threw up earlier.
8980069	8980569	Yeah, you did.
8981129	8983150	Because you're wearing my clothes now, might I point out.
8983350	8984270	Yeah, I am.
8984971	8984991	I...
8986343	8996806	I've drank too much, honestly, normally I drink a lot more water to coincide with my, you know, drinking alcohol, so I don't feel like, you know, I have to eat a cookie.
8996826	8998266	No, I don't, I'm not hungry.
9000927	9002908	I can't eat the cookie right now, honestly.
9003388	9008049	I don't care if you can eat it or not, fucking eat the cookie to neutralize the alcohol in your stomach.
9008789	9010290	I will be sick, honestly.
9013011	9014311	Just give me a second to
9014824	9021566	Freaking, you know, honestly, I just, just give me some water and I'll be fine, okay?
9023047	9032350	Because if I drink anymore, I'm honestly very full right now, and I can't drink anymore, you know, alcohol or anything, to be, you know, honest.
9033430	9036791	I just, I feel honestly tired as hell.
9038232	9041453	This is why you shouldn't drink, folks, I mean, honestly.
9042133	9069737	because you'll end up like me, and that's not good, but, um, just, just whatever, I mean, honestly, thank God my family stopped listening to this show, like, long ago, so, it's not good, just don't go crazy with the alcohol, and just take it easy, you know, have some fun at the fireworks, and whatnot, and whatever.
9071283	9072604	I'm tired, I need a nap.
9073945	9076507	Just don't fall asleep and get my computer wet with that water.
9077148	9087396	No, I'm not, I'm taking care of the computer, because I built this computer, so I know what it needs, you know, it does not need the excess alcohol dripped all over it.
9088096	9091339	So, you know.
9091839	9093040	What the hell are you playing?
9095802	9106946	I mean, it's bad enough that my stomach hurts, I mean, so, folks, people, take it easy on the alcohol, don't go crazy with the fire, you're good, okay.
9110327	9112188	What does the 4th of July mean to you, Loki?
9116489	9118870	Turn on your mic, turn on your mic, your mic's off.
9121380	9122520	What is the 4th of July Meteor?
9122781	9133725	It means crappy fireworks that they've, like, totally toned down because people like me that get drunk and decide to light fireworks, so... You know what?
9134125	9149611	Honestly, people, if I'm spending money on fireworks, I want them to be, you know, extremely explosive, so... I am so tired right now, it's not even funny, it's like... I feel like I'm asleep, so...
9151559	9152620	I don't care, whatever.
9152680	9154641	Have you learned a lesson from today's episode?
9156102	9160064	My lesson from today's episode is drink more water before I start drinking.
9161325	9162706	Other than that, I have learned a thing.
9162726	9165108	The lesson of the evening is no one can fucking out drink me.
9165328	9166168	Ha ha ha.
9168570	9169070	Whatever.
9169090	9170531	I will go back to the liquor bottle.
9172973	9173973	Whatever, Jamie.
9174333	9175574	We do shots at the club tonight.
9175814	9176075	Fine.
9177756	9179777	I'm becoming more coherent.
9188649	9190770	Suddenly Loki went into velociraptor mode.
9193792	9194992	Listen, folks, okay?
9195372	9198554	The room is spinning a lot less than it was before, okay?
9199795	9200135	Water?
9200275	9200975	I have water?
9201876	9202496	Ooh, yay.
9204737	9206538	Just think, Nellie, you get to go home with that.
9208879	9209780	Listen, okay?
9211280	9213722	Yeah, I'll sleep on the edge of the bed, I'm fine.
9214342	9215222	But you know what?
9215623	9218204	When I become sober, ooh yeah.
9219011	9220852	Then what's gonna happen?
9220872	9221392	Oh yeah.
9223913	9225754	Don't you be making fun of me now, okay?
9225774	9229575	Cause when I'm sober, you aren't complaining, okay?
9230976	9232376	He thinks he's gonna get some.
9232396	9233017	Is he?
9233717	9235658	Once he's sober, yes.
9236758	9238779	Damn straight I'm gonna get some.
9239959	9242380	When I'm sober, it's not complaining.
9242600	9244021	When there's no puke on his breath.
9244908	9246009	and when he can get it up.
9246129	9247289	You need a breath mint?
9247549	9249030	Extover, don't you have some breath mints somewhere?
9249050	9250071	I have penguin mints.
9251091	9255674	Honestly, folks, okay, Rob is like, he's all over the place.
9255694	9256614	Hey, I'm sober now.
9257054	9257815	Let's go driving.
9257955	9258395	I'm just kidding.
9258455	9259595	No, I'm totally kidding.
9259896	9263337	If I were to run towards Rob, I would probably hit the wall.
9265438	9266739	So what type of drunk am I?
9266819	9269260	My nose is numb, okay?
9269360	9270161	My hand is numb.
9270181	9271081	So what about my drinking?
9271141	9272562	If Rob gets stupid, what about me?
9276991	9278553	Rob, I am gonna be at that... Microphone towards mouth.
9278573	9279494	Okay.
9279514	9282197	Rob, I am gonna be totally at that stupid convention thing.
9282237	9283218	When they have the people...
9299156	9304340	That shit already happened last Sunday.
9304500	9305101	You weren't there.
9305201	9306222	It happened last Sunday.
9306302	9306822	Where were you?
9306862	9307463	Damn it.
9308664	9312367	Well, fucking A. I'm going to be at the other thing.
9312427	9313628	It's at Paradise Island.
9316230	9317531	Oh, I'm so sick.
9317551	9323656	Sigh.
9328271	9329992	Loki, have you learned any lessons tonight?
9330732	9331072	No.
9332873	9333813	Are you going to drink again?
9334333	9334693	Yes.
9337194	9339755	What will you do differently when you drink next time?
9340155	9341835	Have more food beforehand.
9351398	9356100	I have officially out-drinked everybody because I finished my beer within two minutes of opening it.
9367474	9368215	Are you okay, Loki?
9369295	9371958	I am perfectly fine.
9374060	9377743	No, honestly, my stomach feels a little upset, but other than that, I'm fine.
9379765	9380385	No, you're fine.
9382648	9383869	I'M FINE!
9384892	9393135	Don't be, don't be judging me just because I had a lot of like acid in my stomach from the stupid minestrone.
9396076	9398017	I'm fine right now, okay?
9398097	9400398	If I drink some more water, I'll be fine.
9404299	9406440	Just, I'm drinking water, okay?
9413959	9416401	What the fuck is with this music, okay?
9417081	9419243	You need to fucking turn this shit off.
9419583	9421625	I'm playing something that doesn't lick my ass.
9422546	9424847	I'm fine, I just feel ill.
9429211	9433394	I need to put my thumb on the webcam because my thumb is mutilated now thanks to Guinness.
9437555	9443219	I really don't know what to say to our listeners who have stuck with us through such crap radio tonight.
9443919	9448662	Uh oh, uh oh, oh god, Loki's going to barf again.
9448702	9449383	Is he going to barf again?
9449723	9451364	Nelly, please make sure his head lands in my toilet.
9458389	9459950	Ew, I just heard that.
9461718	9463159	I hope you boys and girls learned something from this.
9463179	9465522	Drinking so much turns you into an ass.
9465542	9466142	A complete and utter ass.
9482455	9491157	Drinking makes me horny.
9491197	9493478	Drinking makes me a cuddle whore.
9495338	9498919	I want to hug everybody.
9502240	9505220	I need waffles and spinach with no water.
9505740	9506100	I don't know.
9506140	9507701	I'm almost thinking we ought to end the show.
9507781	9508401	Because we're just...
9508846	9511889	We've got 15 minutes to go.
9511909	9512410	Go to a break.
9512430	9513151	You want a little break?
9513511	9514792	Alright, we'll think of something to fill up.
9514973	9516794	When we come back, it's Ask Orange Lounge.
9516935	9518076	Alright, Ask Orange Lounge.
9518436	9522020	Send us questions and we'll get them in this next segment.
9522080	9523101	So, Ask Orange Lounge.
9524803	9526745	In the meantime... Oh, that burp tastes like Guinness.
9527185	9528487	I have had 11 drinks tonight.
9529708	9530369	Good job.
9531417	9532899	Will you just barf again?
9533179	9534681	Yeah, I'm going to go take care of it.
9534821	9537244	Okay, we're going to go look and admire it.
9537905	9538405	Cheek break!
9538806	9543952	Send a message to Skye if you have a question for Ask Orange Lounge.
9543972	9546955	In the meantime, we're going to get to... Bomani Potpourri, boys and girls.
9547937	9548758	Started off with...
9550350	9550750	I don't know.
9551270	9554871	How about something from 2DX10th style?
9556092	9557292	I'm by myself right now.
9557312	9558192	That's kind of scary.
9558332	9561493	And I'm starting to sober up, but I'm still... I'm like in that buzzed phase.
9564414	9568335	We'll be back with more of this fun stuff.
9568815	9570615	We'll talk about video games at some point, too.
9570835	9571236	Meteos.
9571496	9571916	Cool game.
9572136	9572416	Play it.
9707418	9713200	Boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob
9728547	9730729	Thank you for watching!
9761226	9762871	Thank you for watching!
9841084	9841725	Thank you for watching!
9977651	9980513	Last week on Orange Lounge Radio.
9980993	9982815	Who was the last person to put their coin up?
9983275	9984576	I'm going after that person.
9984616	9985577	The hell with the rest of you.
9985997	9988078	Although, I almost got killed by a little kid.
9988218	9990980	I think a little four-year-old threatened to cut me at Stockton Golf Line.
9991000	9993622	When I got up there and said, I'm playing.
9994183	9995624	Because this person put their token up.
9995644	9997285	She started talking about, No, it's mine.
9997405	9997725	It's mine.
9997745	9998506	I'm going to cut you.
9998606	10000227	I'm going to kill you in the face.
10000547	10002288	I'm going to put my mommy on you.
10002608	10003349	Where is your mother?
10003409	10005631	Your mother just left you here for me to babysit you.
10005671	10006051	Go away.
10014370	10017172	Join us every Sunday night from 7 p.m.
10017312	10018272	until 9 p.m.
10018352	10028239	Pacific Standard Time for the Orange Lounge with your hosts, DarkSakura and Sky, where we'll talk about all things Bomani and then some.
10028679	10032141	In the meantime, enjoy our Bomani Music and More program.
10032978	10035740	I don't know what the hell these things are that we're playing as we're coming back from break.
10035760	10038062	Those are the old promos we used to have that have little clips.
10038563	10042226	So it's a good way to hear what we used to talk about on old shows.
10042606	10045509	I think that was like the second episode of Orange Lounge that clip came from.
10045869	10046850	I was actually not here.
10047090	10049573	You weren't here for the first couple episodes.
10050393	10052075	That was when I was in the gay dorm room.
10052972	10054114	The Gay Fraternity
10064608	10065649	And then look at his pupils.
10065709	10066729	Loki, do you have the microphone?
10067069	10068570	Can you hand Loki the microphone, Christopher?
10068991	10069631	Make sure it's on there.
10070171	10070732	How are you feeling?
10070872	10072973	You threw up again during that break.
10073073	10079477	I feel... Yeah, I threw up quite a bit that break just because I didn't feel good.
10079657	10084560	Just probably because I had a lot of, like, you know, a lot of acid beforehand.
10085340	10089202	I was eating a... He was taking acid beforehand.
10089823	10093565	And so that's, you know, a lot of tomato soup and that's very acidy, so...
10094400	10098485	I actually only throw up when I have citrus mixture, so that does make sense.
10099626	10102630	I just feel really wasted right now.
10102690	10106475	I'm very tired and not very good.
10106495	10113003	I mean, just, I'm completely out of it, so it's not even funny.
10114528	10115748	Just out of it.
10116008	10116389	Okay.
10116749	10120910	Alright, well, you can participate as you want to in this next segment.
10121070	10123331	I will participate as best as I can.
10123351	10130633	But we figure since our listeners have been so good and putting up with the last hour of this show, which has been kind of crappy.
10132133	10134894	Yeah, I completely understand.
10134954	10138535	This part, actually, some of them are getting kicked out of it, so whatever.
10138575	10139836	We only do this once in a while for you.
10141400	10142561	This part of the show is for you.
10142601	10147985	This is your chance to take the show in any direction you want to by asking Orange Lounge.
10153650	10156552	Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.
10157072	10160335	What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?
10160715	10164098	Will Nellie keep taunting me while I am drunk?
10164538	10167781	Or will she continue to dance a jig while her boyfriend pukes?
10171738	10173940	Don't you be talking crap about me.
10173960	10177643	Rob, that's actually the best opening song you have ever done.
10177883	10179885	And to think I had to be drunk to improvise that.
10180365	10183327	I can't believe that I was actually singing in technical public.
10184508	10186330	Because you know how afraid I am of singing.
10186903	10194824	You know, if I just breathe in and out very deeply, I can probably become coherent enough to actually answer questions or anything.
10194844	10198585	Well, this first one's directed towards the one and only DarkSakura, actually.
10198645	10199445	Thank God for that.
10199505	10202146	The question comes from DeepThought42.
10202866	10206226	And now, Deep Thoughts with Jack Handy.
10206286	10206747	Alright, here it is.
10207007	10207767	DarkSakura, are you ready?
10207947	10210507	We used to go to the cave to see our Uncle Bear.
10211007	10214968	We called him Uncle Bear because he lived in the cave, and sometimes he'd eat one of us.
10215686	10217627	Later on, we found out he actually was a bear.
10219689	10226873	They say that every time a... The face of a child can say it all, especially the mouth part.
10226913	10230675	They say that every time a bell rings, an angel gets its wings.
10231076	10235478	But what they don't tell you is, every time a mousetrap snaps, an angel gets set on fire.
10237099	10237359	Anyway.
10237520	10238400	I love Deep Thoughts.
10240121	10244544	Deep Thought 42, you were saying something earlier about how when you're drinking, you become a big cuddle whore.
10245821	10248324	DeepThought42 wants to know, will Jamie cuddle with me?
10249705	10251267	I'd have to ask my fiancé.
10252188	10255871	And I would imagine that DarkSakura has the following requirements.
10256211	10257753	First of all, you need to have good hygiene.
10257793	10259635	Because if you have VO, she's not going to cuddle with you.
10259935	10260135	Right.
10260516	10262417	And second of all...
10263430	10266792	You have to not be an idiot, because DarkSakura doesn't cuddle with idiots.
10266912	10267933	And you have to have good grammar.
10268193	10271415	You are listening to Orange Launch Radio, which is some plus points there.
10271475	10273316	That proves that you're not a complete idiot.
10273396	10274116	Yes, very good.
10274156	10279819	But you have to have excellent grammar and great enunciation skills.
10280380	10280680	Alright.
10282141	10283321	Are those like your turn-ons?
10284582	10287083	Oh my god, grammar makes me so fucking horny!
10289365	10291506	Wow, now I know what clip I'm going to use in the next intro.
10293482	10300786	And now... And now... And now he just said that monkeys make her horny.
10301586	10304367	Call 1-900-DARK-SAKURA.
10304447	10304868	Shut up.
10304908	10307049	Her turn-ons are good grammar.
10308409	10310070	And guys that... And Xanadu.
10310350	10311691	Guys that have good hygiene.
10312791	10316234	My turn-ons are Electric Light Orchestra and Good Grammar.
10316254	10320618	I get off on Sesame Street, yo.
10321919	10322880	Loki passed out.
10324601	10327984	Please stop with the talking about what turn-ons are.
10328004	10330446	Okay, as soon as he stops using the letter U instead of Y-O-U.
10330466	10330666	Okay, um...
10338493	10339654	Ron Chan has a question.
10339794	10343856	I just want to get this alcohol out of my system ASAP.
10343896	10346178	You need to be saving your energy for the podcast.
10347038	10347899	Okay, whatever.
10347939	10348939	Ron Chan has a question.
10349340	10350320	Here's my question.
10350360	10352902	You said on the podcast that Bomberman DS was $20.
10353963	10355183	Where the hell did you find it for $20?
10355243	10357545	Because I sure as hell couldn't.
10357565	10360146	That was actually Miklatov that ended up buying that for $20.
10360226	10367411	I don't know where he bought it, but knowing him, it was probably EB Games or GameStop, one of the two, because he used to work for EB Games before he was at Konami.
10368091	10370634	And, uh, who else sells?
10370774	10371394	Actually, you know what?
10371454	10374797	I saw a good deal on Meteos at Target, of all places.
10374897	10378400	They only wanted $29.99 as opposed to $39.99 for it, so that was good.
10379001	10380862	So, shop around.
10380943	10385046	Check Frugal as a part of Google, if nothing else, and you'll find a good deal there.
10385386	10391211	From what I understand, though, and you're probably a little late for this, but Circuit City apparently had a really good deal on video games today.
10391992	10398154	Like, they were selling $10 video games today, like Amplitude, and what's that GameCube role-playing game, Bighton Kaitos or whatever?
10398634	10400155	Those were all like $10 today.
10400295	10400915	Pretty cool, huh?
10402916	10403176	Alright.
10406097	10409818	Oh, DeepThought42 wants you to know that his father is an English professor.
10410498	10411119	I'm sorry, English.
10411459	10411799	I'm drunk.
10412519	10414080	His father is an English professor.
10415260	10416601	That's awfully tempting.
10416621	10417441	That's pretty hot.
10417541	10420262	However, I am highly taken.
10421042	10422683	My fiance is excellent.
10422763	10424284	It's just a cuddle.
10424745	10425505	It's just a cuddle.
10426066	10427086	It's not making out.
10427147	10427887	It's not sex.
10427987	10428287	All right.
10429248	10439255	VidPowell wants to know, is the OLR crew doing anything worth mentioning on the 4th of July?
10439756	10441457	I'm eating me some meat!
10441777	10443778	We know Loki has to deal with his family tomorrow.
10444919	10446100	Oh, my God.
10446120	10447601	I'm sorry.
10447701	10448362	Oh, my car.
10448722	10449683	Because my car is gone.
10450680	10452962	I'm so dizzy right now, it's so funny.
10452982	10454783	Are you going to barf because I need to go back to the bathroom?
10454823	10457604	I'm not going to throw up, no, I'm just really dizzy.
10458505	10462407	If I take, if my stomach is fine, I'll be fine.
10463928	10465029	You look kind of bloated.
10466990	10468071	Seriously!
10468631	10473114	Okay, what is the first thing that alcohol does that makes you brutally honest with everybody?
10473914	10476596	Sort of like how, what was it Margaret Cho said about grappa?
10477617	10478597	You have that skin!
10480129	10480850	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
10510814	10513295	Thank God, because this show is really starting to go downhill fast.
10513715	10518136	So now we're going to go around and get everybody, and now we're going to try and tape a podcast.
10518176	10519037	That should be tons of fun.
10519557	10522458	Now we're going to go around and get everybody's final thought.
10523538	10526539	DarkSakura, why don't you start us off, because you're the most sober out of everybody.
10526559	10527319	What's your final thought?
10527779	10529300	Reject false icons.
10531260	10532561	Extaper, do you have a final thought?
10532961	10533421	Don't hide.
10533761	10535262	Come here, Extaper, do you have a final thought?
10536862	10539203	I am not drunk and I don't have a final thought.
10539323	10539783	I'm sorry.
10540782	10541142	Here we go.
10542423	10543404	Nellie, what's your final thought?
10544745	10546246	We are not coming back over here.
10549569	10553112	And my final thought is, remember kids, don't drink and drive.
10553973	10555594	And Loki, your final thought?
10556635	10557936	I don't want any more alcohol.
10558717	10558977	Ever?
10558997	10561719	At least this week.
10561959	10562280	All right.
10562700	10563461	That's the spirit.
10564722	10565042	All right.
10565939	10574136	The final word of the show One word to sum it all up Thank you guys for listening by the way And big hugs and kisses And if this was your first show tonight Seriously guys
10575236	10577118	This isn't what it's normally like.
10577158	10578839	I'm sorry to see your first show.
10579480	10582242	We normally are not drunken louts on the show.
10582302	10588407	I didn't even think that because of the iTunes thing, we'd have way more listeners this week, meaning we'd have way more people who are listening to the show the first time.
10589087	10591710	Whoops, that was a bad calculation on when to do a drunk show.
10592410	10592790	My bad.
10592831	10599416	We did the drunk show because, first of all, it is our three-year anniversary, plus it is also a three-day weekend.
10599456	10600797	We were taking advantage of it.
10601338	10603980	Every three-day weekend that comes up, we usually get pissed.
10605219	10607280	So, again, tune in next week.
10607320	10608360	Give us one more chance.
10608560	10610200	I swear we will be sober.
10610700	10615342	Loki will probably be highly embarrassed because his family's been listening to him drunk on the show.
10616382	10620443	And we'll be full of our usual, you know, piss and angst next week.
10622744	10624324	Really quick last minute questions.
10624824	10626565	Actually, just one from Dirty Thief.
10626745	10627565	See, another new name.
10627625	10628385	I don't recognize his name.
10628885	10631606	Can Loki share with us his family reactions on the next show?
10633433	10634854	Nelly says she'll do it, if nothing else.
10635935	10637237	Loki's reaching for the microphone.
10638298	10647306	Well, my reaction is probably to my family is going to be, they'll be, like, surprised that I'm drunk on this show, but they'll probably understand this is a three-day weekend.
10647507	10648768	It's just a radio show.
10648788	10653052	Other than that, you know, they'll just be like, I can't believe we heard you're drunk.
10654173	10655834	He's going to sleep so well tonight.
10655914	10659916	I'm just really tired right now and I don't feel so good.
10661137	10667621	I'm just going to try to deal with this alcohol as best I can without making a mess of the apartment.
10669342	10670683	Final word of the show.
10671443	10673144	One word to sum it all up.
10673944	10677547	Loki, pick that microphone back up and give us one word that sums it all up.
10677567	10678227	See you next week, everybody.
10679844	10682486	Don't drink and drive, it's really bad.
