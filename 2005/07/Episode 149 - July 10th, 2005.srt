Yeah.

51
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,600
Yeah, because our chat room loves to hear the two songs overlapping each other.

52
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,600
Very nice.

53
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,600
How are you doing, Tech Massa Loki?

56
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,600
How are you feeling?

57
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,600
I'm fine.

58
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,600
Did you...

59
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,600
How many times did you ralph after the show was over?

60
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,600
Um...

61
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,000
I don't remember too much, whatever was here

62
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,200
and then that was it. Alright, we'll get to that a little later. Also,

63
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,440
joining us at least for a little bit, she's about to go run and get some ice cream,

64
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:35,820
but

65
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:39,680
the official lesbian of Orange Lounge Radio,

66
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,720
did we give you a nickname? Precious Amanda.

67
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,160
And Mandarin, or Manders, whatever.

68
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,240
But you have a follow-up to this, don't you? I'm not a lesbian anymore.

69
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,960
As the straight listeners

70
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:58,080
breathe a sigh of disappointment. What happened?

71
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:03,720
She wasn't very nice.

72
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:09,320
We didn't work out. She ruined it for everyone.

73
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:13,560
Pretty much. Chicks are still hot, but I have a boyfriend

74
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,640
and yeah. Alright. I like dick.

75
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:21,120
Alright. Go eat ice cream. I like the cod. Get off our show.

76
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,120
Bye.

77
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,120
Alright.

78
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,480
Also joining us, DDR Angel is here for the first time in a while.

79
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,720
God, I love her shirt too.

80
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,720
That's so hilarious.

81
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,720
Hi, I'm back.

82
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,720
Oh my God.

83
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,720
I love that shirt.

84
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,720
Where did you get that shirt?

85
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:39,000
Uh, thank you.com.

86
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,240
For those that, obviously this is radio, so you can't exactly see her shirt.

87
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,040
She's got a Domo-kun shirt on, but it's like all brown.

88
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,040
Oh, it's cute.

89
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,040
I like it.

90
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,040
Baby panda born.

91
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,040
Anyway.

92
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:52,880
Orange, meeting the news is a baby panda.

93
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,440
Alright, we will get to the baby, I read about that earlier, we'll get to the baby panda,

94
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:02,360
we'll get to Domo-kun, we'll get to post-drunkenness and randomness and games and whole lots more

95
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:07,320
when we come back after this break filled with some rump-shaking music.

96
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,720
We'll be back after this.

97
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,720

98
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:21,720
Come on baby, let's dream a dream together. A dream that is real.

99

Don't die, don't die. Don't die, don't die. Don't die, don't die. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

Get up, stand up, touch up, bump the drum

178
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:18,060
Get up, stand up, touch up, bump the drum

179
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:21,060
Get up, stand up, touch up, bump the drum

180
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:23,060
Get up, stand up

181
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:28,060
Orange Lounge Radio

182
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:30,060
Bimani Music

183
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:32,060
and more

184
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:36,340
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 149.

185
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:37,620
How you guys doing tonight?

186
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:40,460
Happy Sunday to you guys out there.

187
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:43,060
I can't believe it's already like mid-July.

188
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,620
Where did this year go?

189
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:50,260
It seems like it's just, I feel my age slipping away as the days keep flying by.

190
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:52,540
Is anyone else feeling incredibly old this evening?

191
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,420
Maybe it's just me.

192
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,420
No.

193
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:55,060
It's just you.

194
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:55,900
No.

195
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,180
All right.

196
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:57,680
Hey, Rob.

197
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,180
What?

198
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:58,680
Rob.

199
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,180
What?

200
00:13:59,180 --> 00:13:59,680
Rob.

201
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,180
What?

202
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:00,680
Rob.

203
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,180
What?

204
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:01,680
Rob.

205
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,680
Bitch.

206
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,680
So?

207
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,680
Kisses?

208
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:11,940
Okay, um, first off, I want to thank, I want to thank Loki, I want to give hearts to Loki

209
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:16,600
because he got me a late birthday present, he bought me Kirby Canvas Curse, the DS, and

210
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,080
you can paint rainbows in that game, so I'm very excited to go paint me some rainbows,

211
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,080
so that'll be fun.

212
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,080
Thank you, Loki!

213
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,080
You're welcome.

214
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,400
As soon as I get paid, I can get your present, but I've been sort of busy moving.

215
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,400
Well, you did give me the seatbelts, and-

216
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,200
I gave you last year's present.

217
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,980
Those are pretty nifty, except I've kind of been afraid to actually put them in my car

218
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:35,620
because I'm afraid they'll get stolen.

219
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:38,220
But I'm going to put them in there now that the glass is replaced, I'm going to put them

220
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:40,260
in there because they just replaced my glass yesterday.

221
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,260
Cool.

222
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:45,400
So I just hope my freaking car doesn't get broken into again, except I will be getting

223
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,400
an alarm this week.

224
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,160
I've gotten some leads on some good deals and I'm very excited.

225
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:53,560
For those that are not sure where I'm going with this, my car was broken into.

226
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:57,780
I've lived in this new place where we're doing the show now about, what, about two and a

227
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:58,780
half months.

228
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:01,740
The car's been broken into twice in that span of time.

229
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,140
I've had two stereos stolen.

230
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:06,420
The first time, it was funny, because my stereo was actually broken.

231
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,940
So the thieves stole a broken stereo.

232
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:11,620
Second time, not so funny, because they stole a perfectly fine working stereo

233
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,820
and decided to break some glass.

234
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,700
And they screwed up the lock on my car.

235
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:18,360
So I have to climb my big butt over the passenger seat

236
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,820
every time I want to get in the car.

237
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:23,900
That's payback for having a broken stereo the first time

238
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,620
they broke into your car.

239
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,080
That's what everybody's telling me.

240
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,080
You were being watched.

241
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,080
I'm making a new volume.

242
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,080
No, you're fine. You sound great.

243
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,080
Just so you guys know, I have headphones now.

244
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,080
I finally replaced my headphones after like a month.

245
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,080
So I turned the in-studio down.

246
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,080
That's hardly fair to the rest of us because now I can't hear myself.

247
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,080
Do you want me to turn this up?

248
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,080
A little.

249
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,080
Okay, I thought you didn't like it when I...

250
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,080
Well, because you talk like you're screaming into the microphone.

251
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,080
Oh, I'm sorry.

252
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,080
You big old loudmouth.

253
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,080
We can leave the door unlocked for weeks and no one will come in.

254
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,080
I know you had the same luck I was having at your old place.

255
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,080
Because the old place I lived in was a big sack of shit.

256
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,080
That's the truth.

257
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,080
Now that you're not living there anymore, do you want to give them a shout-out?

258
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,080
Where not to move?

259
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,080
Never live at St. Tropez Apartments on the corner of Garfield and Marconi and...

260
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,080
I don't know.

261
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,080
I don't know.

262
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,080
I don't know.

263
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,080
I don't know.

264
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,080
I don't know.

265
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,080
I don't know.

266
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,080
I don't know.

267
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:25,840
of Garfield and Marconi in Carmichael. That place is a festering pile of dog crap with

268
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:34,840
worms in it. Even worse, it's the waste put off by a tapeworm. And tapeworms eat waste.

269
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:40,120
Alright, Stalker fans, she doesn't live there anymore, so it's waste squared. It's waste

270
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:47,700
times infinity. It's super waste. It's Ooberpoo! It's waste extreme. Uh-uh, no, it's Ooberpoo.

271
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,700
And a Miro presents, Pump It Up, Waste.

272
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:54,700
Hey, I saw Pump It Up, um, the new Pump It Up, in, uh, Vegas, in Reno.

273
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:57,700
Like, exceed five million, what are they up to?

274
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:00,700
I just sorta walked past it and go, huh, and then...

275
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,700
You didn't get up there and play some Run To You?

276
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,700
Actually, I don't think Run To You is a new one.

277
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,700
It's not in there. Therefore, it's no longer worth playing.

278
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:09,700
There's gotta be some K... I don't call it K-Pop, I call it K-Booty.

279
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,700
There's gotta be some K-Booty in there.

280
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:15,700
Um, no, I ended up winning plushies out of the Crane Games.

281
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,500
Oh, well that's fun too, I guess.

282
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:21,660
I have one of the Donkey Dragons from, you know, whatever spawn of Donkey and Dragon

283
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:22,660
from Shrek 2.

284
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:23,660
Oh.

285
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:24,660
I have one of the Donkey Dragons.

286
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:25,660
Cute.

287
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:26,660
And a Hello Kitty!

288
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:27,660
Aww.

289
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,700
I love Hello Kitty.

290
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,700
And I got, what else did I get?

291
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:32,700
I got one more.

292
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:37,420
Oh yeah, I played, you know those games where you play basketball, you know, you pay fifty

293
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:39,620
cents and if you hoop you get some type of plushie?

294
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:40,620
I got a plushie fish.

295
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:41,620
Cool.

296
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:42,620
So I beat Julie in the head with it.

297
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:49,320
Well, just because I felt inspired by our chat room with the, uh, slap command, I told

298
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:52,040
Julie that it was my homage to the radio station.

299
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,040
Your trout command?

300
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,040
Yeah.

301
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,040
Slaps Julie with a large trout?

302
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,040
It's slap.

303
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,040
Where is...

304
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,760
Julie hasn't been to the show for a while.

305
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,720
This is because Julie's lazy.

306
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,400
Julie, stop being lazy.

307
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,400
Come visit us.

308
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,920
We love you, Julie, but you're lazy.

309
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,920
Okay.

310
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,600
Thank you for driving, but next time I drive, because your car...

311
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,360
Lou's car is the suck going uphill.

312
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:17,120
She has to turn off the air conditioner.

313
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,480
Oh, it's one of those cars.

314
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,400
She's like, I love my fuel efficient car.

315
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,720
Fuel efficient, fuel efficient.

316
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:27,840
I like my car that accelerates up hills and doesn't lose speed.

317
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,840
And I don't have to turn off the air conditioner.

318
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,600
It may eat gas, but god damn it, my car is bad.

319
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,080
I drive the Renos a bitch, too.

320
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,720
All right, anyway, since you're already

321
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,360
kind of talking about your weekend,

322
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,240
I might as well ask you, how was your week?

323
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,040
How was your day, Dark Sakura?

324
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,040
It was awesome.

325
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:47,160
Well, my week was kind of, ugh, but the rest of the week was pretty cute.

326
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,560
So I saw George Carlin last night and he was freaking awesome, but all he did was talk

327
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:54,760
about suicide and natural disasters and how it was cool to watch people die.

328
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:59,840
I was like, okay, but it was really funny, but the thing that kind of got me is that

329
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:10,360
he was learning his new material for the 13th HBO special coming up and he kept reading

330
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:13,860
off paper the whole time I was like I feel kind of unprofessional but hey he's

331
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:25,420
been doing it for what 50 years he's entitled I guess um I also um you know

332
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:31,980
we went to the the nice places to eat at the silver legacy in Reno and every

333
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:38,060
freaking thing I ate made me sick so I've decided I'm never eating again but

334
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:42,640
you were chopping on nuts earlier nuts don't count yeah I like to eat nuts I

335
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:49,840
bet um but no my ways of combating it are basically I'm gonna be fasting for

336
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:56,780
the next three days like eating when I really have to and drinking like this

337
00:19:56,780 --> 00:20:02,080
tea that's supposed to every and I think it's just because I think that I've got

338
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,380
like a toxic buildup or something and last time I did that I ate a lot of

339
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:12,380
garlic and drink this tea and drink a lot of water and it cleared everything up so hopefully

340
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:20,300
I won't have any nasty blood poisoning or anything. Hope not. I mean that could be kind

341
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:24,000
of dangerous but just take care of yourself. As I said earlier you might want to consult

342
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,000
the doctor. Yeah, I'm tired of going to the doctor. My butt's finally healed. I'm sorry

343
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I'm sorry, my hip. Mostly.

344
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Sounded a little foul there for a minute.

345
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
You know what?

346
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
What?

347
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I'm going to throw this ferret at you.

348
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Jamie's butt?

349
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Rob?

350
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
What?

351
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I got the finger.

352
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Alright, anything else you want to share?

353
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
No.

354
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Loki, how was your week, how was your day?

355
00:20:53,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Um, it was good. I've been working, doing the work stuff, and... I don't know, I've just been kind of...

356
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:11,000
We went and met with another rabbi yesterday and found one, and guess what? He's an ex-pro-wrestler.

357
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Why did he wrestle as?

358
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I don't know, but it was a long time ago, like, you know, back in the day.

359
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:28,000
you know, back when professional wrestling was just coming about, not like, you know, WWE type stuff, but like, you know, back, you know, with spandex suits, you know, that type of thing.

360
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:46,000
So, um, yeah, ex-pro wrestler. That was kinda cool. And, um, then what else? Oh, just been, um, oh, I was sticking around the house and stuff, playing with my PSP, and doing things with the PSP that...

361
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Playing with the PSP and doing things with the PSP?

362
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
They're borderline illegal, you know, that type of thing.

363
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I see.

364
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I have right now, I have games on my PSP and stuff, and a lot of fun stuff like that.

365
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:10,000
And then I've been playing games on my PlayStation 2, like I picked up Killer7, and that's sweet.

366
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,000
How is that? Well, I guess you can talk about it later on the podcast, but give me a brief rundown. How is that?

367
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
It's psychotic. It's the best way to describe it.

368
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I'm really curious about that game. I want to pick that one up.

369
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:27,000
It plays well. Everyone's griping about the control scheme on it, but it reminds me of, like, almost like Alone in the Dark, in a sense.

370
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:39,000
But it's very, very psychotic, and I've only been playing it for, like, I'm only in the second level, and it makes little sense, but you sort of get what the story's going on.

371
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,300
Apparently, well, I can't really spoil anything, but based on some of the notes that you get

372
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:50,140
and stuff, it makes you feel like that you yourself are another one of his personalities,

373
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:53,680
the character that you're playing, who has seven different personalities.

374
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:58,320
And it's just psychotic, and there's a bunch of people that you talk to.

375
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:02,280
It reminds me also of kind of like a Japanese anime movie or something, because there's

376
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:06,060
this severed head that you talk to now and then, then there's this guy that helps you

377
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:08,820
who is like on some string, looks like a corpse.

378
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:13,540
There's some other dead guy that you talk to, a bunch of weird shit like that, and it's

379
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:14,540
just psychotic.

380
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:16,180
Just go play, it's fun.

381
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,860
Alright, I'm curious about this game.

382
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:20,100
There's not a whole lot of games that have come out lately.

383
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:24,060
I found myself very challenged this week trying to find something new, because I try to play

384
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:30,240
at least one new game every week for the podcast, so I have something new to talk about, but

385
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,420
there really wasn't a whole lot new for me to get this week, so I had to go get something

386
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,980
I would never usually play.

387
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:38,580
So, I'll get to that later though.

388
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:41,580
Anything else you want to share about your week here today?

389
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,580
Just that I've been playing a lot of PSP games.

390
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:44,580
I've got follow-up questions for you, though.

391
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,580
What happened after last week's show? I've got to know.

392
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:50,580
Your family was listening. How was the next day? How was the Fourth of July for you?

393
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:55,580
It was fine. They didn't really bring it up. It was just kind of funny.

394
00:23:55,580 --> 00:24:01,580
And that was pretty much it. I didn't have a hangover. Just slept it off.

395
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:05,580
Just also a follow-up for our listeners, if you were listening last week.

396
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:06,700
you were listening last week.

397
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:09,220
Here's what actually happened, OK?

398
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:13,420
So every shot that I thought I was taking

399
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:15,540
was not exactly a shot.

400
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:19,020
Apparently, the glass I was using was not a shot glass.

401
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,940
It was a double shot glass.

402
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:24,020
And so it was kind of, and I was filling it to the brim.

403
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:27,060
So it was about two and a half shots per shot that I thought

404
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:28,060
I was taking.

405
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:30,540
So for example, in the beginning of the show, I'm

406
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:32,140
like, oh yeah, I'm down four shots.

407
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:33,660
I was actually down eight shots.

408
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:41,660
And so, by the end of the night, I think I was down 16 shots within about an hour, which is probably why I got sick.

409
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:48,660
Or 16 or more shots, because I was gone, and to the point where actually I don't remember parts of the night, so...

410
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:52,660
But, I remember most of it. It's just a lot of it's really fuzzy.

411
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:54,660
Do you remember just kind of sitting here, chilling, and then all of a sudden...

412
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:55,660
Yes!

413
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:57,660
I remember that.

414
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:01,660
We just got the stains cleaned up today. It's exciting.

415
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:06,220
I remember that. Probably didn't help that I had like a big heaping bowl of

416
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:10,220
ministering before I came over. That's just very acidic, especially on the carpet.

417
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:14,860
So just to clarify guys, every time Matt said he was taking a double shot, he was

418
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:19,020
actually having a double double shot, which is a quadruple shot, meaning when

419
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:23,660
he said he had 10 shots, he really had 20. We're surprised he didn't end up in the

420
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:27,260
hospital. So kids, here's the lesson to be learned. When

421
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:30,380
you're drinking, and you're the only one drinking from a

422
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:36,780
a bottle of vodka. When the bottle's halfway gone, that's a good clue to stop drinking.

423
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:44,100
The bottle was pretty much gone by the time I was done. So, yeah, but, you know, you should

424
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:47,060
stop, you should have stopped about halfway and then you would have had the, you know,

425
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:55,740
bleh. Well, I know from now on. And going is half the battle. The more you know. G.I.

426
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:56,740
go.

427
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:57,740
Alright.

428
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:59,740
So yeah, that's pretty much it.

429
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:04,780
I was surprised I didn't have a hangover.

430
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:06,860
Apparently I drank a lot of water here.

431
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:08,100
I don't remember any of that.

432
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,700
You did, you drank a lot of water.

433
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,200
I don't remember any of that.

434
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,340
We had to buy a new Brita filter because of you.

435
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,340
No, I'm kidding.

436
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:19,020
Honestly, I don't remember any of the drinking and water or pitchers or whatever, but I guess

437
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:21,020
I did, so yeah.

438
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,020
Alrighty.

439
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:23,220
Anything else?

440
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:30,020
The entire podcast, like I stated on the podcast, I did not remember any of the podcasts, so

441
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:31,020
I had to listen to it.

442
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,700
And what did you think when you were listening to it?

443
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:36,060
I thought it was interesting because I'd say the same thing like three times in a row in

444
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:38,140
all in one run-on sentence.

445
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:43,820
Yeah, which made last week's podcast our longest podcast to date, thank you very much.

446
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:47,980
It's like, you know, that game completely sucks.

447
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:53,980
And I gotta tell you, that game completely sucks. And that game completely sucks.

448
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:58,980
You know what? That's half the other video game podcasts out there, though. Honestly, if you listen to their reviews...

449
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,980
Not to knock on the other podcasts, but...

450
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:02,980
But I am.

451
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,980
But I am. Sorry.

452
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:08,980
Alright. Um...

453
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:12,980
What? What? You were gonna say something? Come on. Out with it.

454
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:14,980
I'm gonna be nice today.

455
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:17,980
Please, please, be mean, be vicious.

456
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:22,980
You are a lame-ass drunk.

457
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,980
See, that was funny.

458
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:26,980
All right.

459
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:30,980
The hell did you want me to do? Like, jump up in the air, fly, spit fire, what?

460
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:33,980
I don't know what the hell your expectations were.

461
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:37,980
Didn't you see it when Dark Soccer was doing that last week?

462
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:38,980
No?

463
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:40,980
No, because you were sitting there staring at your toes.

464
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:42,980
And me, I'm always on fire, so what can I say?

465
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:43,980
You look so hot.

466
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:14,980
I'm not gonna be...

467
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:15,980
Another round.

468
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:16,980
Um...

469
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:21,740
You know, I noticed during the pre-show that some folks from my old link show, and they're

470
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:26,900
probably trying to get me back, but I've gotta resist temptation.

471
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,420
Yeah, we were talking about that.

472
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:32,860
You know, I haven't cancelled my account for 5.5.11 or anything, so I can go back to that

473
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:36,560
when I find the disc and install them and stuff.

474
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,300
Do you want your World of Warcraft disc back, by the way?

475
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,300
No, it's okay.

476
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,860
I'll fix that later, too.

477
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:46,260
I'm also going to plan on picking up Guild Wars this week too, so yay!

478
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:51,700
Guild Wars was fun for me for like a week, and then I don't know, I just kinda...

479
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:56,640
I didn't get it at the most, too much.

480
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,600
That mic is screwy, we're going to have to replace it.

481
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:02,780
I saw Guild Wars in action, and I thought it was okay.

482
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:06,040
I don't care for the animation style in it.

483
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:10,000
There's things I really like about Guild Wars, and that is no monthly fee,

484
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:17,120
It's a very pretty looking game, and I like the, um, uh, like player versus player elements

485
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:20,260
are actually really fun, so it's not a bad game.

486
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:25,600
I just, for some reason, I could not immerse myself in that the way I could Final Fantasy.

487
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,220
I have a PSO.

488
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:29,220
I'm fine with PSO.

489
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:31,220
Alrighty.

490
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:37,020
And I got some DS games this week that I will probably touch on a little bit later, assuming

491
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:45,900
we get to play it um but uh medios and uh i got to watch a bunch of like uh well stuff

492
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:51,940
that's been around for a while we had a trial of a everquest 2 and so andrew was like trying

493
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:56,180
that out and i was watching that for a little bit and it's just you know i've just been

494
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:59,340
i've been in the game scene but out of the game scene at the same time if that makes

495
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:03,460
sense i don't know if i should admit this but i've actually been really curious about

496
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:08,820
I request to and I kind of want to try it out. I think PC gamer has like a trial disk or something anyway

497
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:12,620
What do you want to be fat and lazy?

498
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:16,500
Come on. No no no the funny thing about

499
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:23,140
Andrew trying the 30-day trial or not or whatever the little trial disk was as soon as he installed it as soon as he logged

500
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:29,340
In he looks at me with this you know Andrew look and he's like hmm slash pizza. I'm like shut up

501
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,900
It's funny

502
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:36,980
Is that slash pizza thing for real? I think so. We didn't try it though.

503
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:40,820
I was kind of hoping it was this big urban legend online or something.

504
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:44,820
No luck. Alright, my week and my day. Oh, I'm sorry. Is that it?

505
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:49,580
Yeah, that's it pretty much. My week and my day. It was okay. You know what, since I didn't really have

506
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:53,460
the car to drive around in me. I had a car but I couldn't really take it anywhere

507
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:53,820
because

508
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:57,140
it was not safe to leave in a parking lot with no window.

509
00:30:57,140 --> 00:31:00,980
Besides my work parking lot because they have cameras there. I really didn't do an awful lot.

510
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:07,440
I just kind of sat on my big butt and you know sniff. I know actually I have a couple of my friends took me places

511
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,160
So I was able to get out of the house at least like once in a while, which is good

512
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:14,120
But some things I did while I was sitting at home all sad and lonely

513
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:20,040
Um, I I am obsessed with this program called Google Earth. Oh, yeah

514
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:24,880
I was playing with that last night and I downloaded it but I haven't done anything since I've been so busy. I

515
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:30,300
I seriously it is my new time waster like I will sit here and I will just go

516
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:34,360
on Google Earth here's what Google Earth is basically they bought this program or

517
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:38,620
this software called keyhole and now they're giving it away for three free

518
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:42,100
and basically what it is it's very similar to Google Maps how you have the

519
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:45,540
satellite views on Google Maps and it's fun to like try and find your house and

520
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:50,460
stuff but imagine that but like the size of the world like I was traveling to

521
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:54,260
Tokyo and I was looking at the maps of Tokyo and I was looking at Moscow and

522
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:59,980
like, all these crazy places, right? It's a way to, like, travel the world without leaving

523
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:05,500
your chair, which I'm sure would be a great marketing slogan for them, but I just, I find

524
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:08,540
myself fascinated just looking at different places. I'm like, I wonder what the border

525
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:11,980
to Mexico looks like, because I've never been there. And, like, I'll look along the Mexican

526
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:14,340
and border, see if I can see any people. No, I'm kidding. But...

527
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:18,340
The White House is pixeled out? Yeah, the White House is pixelated out, which

528
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:22,980
I think is very interesting. But it's also that way, if I remember right, on Google satellite

529
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:27,360
maps too because they don't want bad people to find it actually to add to

530
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:32,460
that like the second search Andrew did he was like hmm let's see if I could do

531
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:42,160
troop movements I'm like shut up he was just being silly but I mean like now I'm

532
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:46,200
using it no like I'm using Google Earth to do research like for instance neon FM

533
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:51,060
they had an address on their website like contact us if you want to be a beta

534
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:54,060
tester and I think it had an address on there so I was like I wonder if this is

535
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:56,980
some dude's apartment or if this is like a legit business so I put in the address

536
00:32:56,980 --> 00:33:01,400
and Google her and I looked at it and I couldn't tell it was kind of like I

537
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:05,380
couldn't tell if it was it's either like it's either a business complex or it's

538
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:10,860
like duplexes type thing I don't know I I know that sounds very stalkerish but

539
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:16,540
I'm very curious as somebody who is is part of a art startup business ourselves

540
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:20,620
with Orange Lounge Radio kind of running it out of our apartments our address

541
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:24,340
though I can't say the address where we live over the air but it sounds very

542
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:27,580
corporate like the name of the street sounds like a street that would be

543
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:30,940
downtown we have an apartment number so I think when people hear it it's also

544
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:35,180
considering the location of what else is nearby true very true I actually live in

545
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:40,140
a very commercial district part of town so very interesting so people might

546
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:42,740
assume like when they see it on the business card like oh they're in a you

547
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:46,260
know nice office not out of some schmoes apartment so this is really curious if

548
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:49,460
that thing was being run out of somebody's apartment or duplex or if it

549
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:52,260
was a legit office.

550
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:52,700
I don't know.

551
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:54,700
Am I crazy?

552
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:57,620
Always, always crazy.

553
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:03,140
Oh, our chat room says it is an actual office building.

554
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:04,340
Sakurina says that.

555
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:06,140
And there's pictures of it on popnco.com.

556
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:08,220
See, I should have just done the research and followed the

557
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:09,460
links the old fashioned way.

558
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:10,260
That's not fun.

559
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:11,980
I had to Google Earth it, because Google

560
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:14,140
Earth is the new orange.

561
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:15,620
I don't know.

562
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:16,740
Google Earth is awesome.

563
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:17,420
Here's the thing, though.

564
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:19,780
You can't get it right now from Google's website

565
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:21,460
because they said too many people have

566
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:22,460
tried to download it.

567
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:23,340
But here's the trick.

568
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:26,420
Go to download.com and do a search for Google Earth,

569
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:27,940
and you can get it that way still.

570
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:30,140
Ha ha ha, fooled you, Google people.

571
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:31,140
It's so much fun.

572
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:33,300
I can't explain why it's so great.

573
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:36,040
It's just so fun to just look at different areas

574
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:39,100
and look at places I've traveled to and airports.

575
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:39,820
It's fun.

576
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:42,140
But warning, if you live in a rural area,

577
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:44,260
your satellite pictures probably aren't very good.

578
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:47,060
If you don't live within 50 miles of a major city,

579
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:53,400
probably is just a big blur what your house looks like so all right um there

580
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:58,240
was that and I have to I have to give a shout out to this because it's kind of

581
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:02,480
DDR related it's a it's a game that's really really popular over on the DDR

582
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:06,480
freak forums it's this game they play in random chat called the wolf game have

583
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:10,820
you guys ever seen this oh yes it's kind of neat it's a fun little game that they

584
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:14,440
play over in random chat and it's like I don't know how to I don't know how to

585
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:19,760
explain it. It's like Survivor meets the Salem Witch Trials. I don't know, I really

586
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,720
don't know how to explain it, but it's a forum game and it's kind of like you're trying to fool

587
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:27,640
people into thinking you're human, but three or four players, depending on the

588
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:30,680
game rules, are assigned to be a wolf and they're slowly killing off the other

589
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:36,080
players. And then everybody else gets to lynch one person. It's kind of crazy.

590
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:40,000
Go to DDR Free Granum Chat, look for any thread that starts with TWG and they've

591
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:47,240
got rules posted. I played my first game and I lost. I lost. I can, I can talk about it

592
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,240
now. Did you get lynched?

593
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:53,520
I did not get lynched. I was a wolf and I got hit by the vigilante. There was an auxiliary

594
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,320
role in the game. But the vigilante is a new thing.

595
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,160
It's kind of like, I don't think it existed in the first few games. But the vigilante

596
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:03,320
basically is a human that can take out any player at any time. And I got wasted and I

597
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:07,840
was so pissed off because I didn't even remember that the game had one of those. But, you know,

598
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:11,760
hats off to the guy that did it because basically he won it. See, he single-handedly won the

599
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:18,680
game for the human team, so hats off to that guy. So, but it's a fun game. I endorse that

600
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:23,200
forum game, although it took me like 36 games to finally jump in it. I thought it was fun,

601
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:27,320
so I don't know. I just want to give a shout out to that because I like cute little forum

602
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:36,100
games like that, so. Anyway, let's see. What else is there? Oh, I know. Let's have Orange

603
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:39,100
Orange Lounge Radio Movie Time. How's that sound?

604
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,100
Yay!

605
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:45,100
Hey, I'm bitter about movies right now, because nobody will go see Land of the Dead with me.

606
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:47,100
Aw, I'm sorry.

607
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:49,100
I'm sad.

608
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:52,100
Oh, I want to respond to some comments in the chat room there.

609
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:55,100
OrangeLoungeRadio.com, click on chat.

610
00:36:55,100 --> 00:37:00,100
And if OrangeLoungeRadio.com is not working for you right now, some people are timing out when they hit it,

611
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:03,100
you can view our chat room the old-fashioned way.

612
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:09,580
connect to an other side IRC server. A good one would be, what's the one I'm on

613
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:14,880
right now here, it's IRC.introversion.net if you have an IRC client and then join

614
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:19,800
channel Orange Lounge. So that's that's the way to do it. But I did want to

615
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:23,800
respond to some folks in the chat room there. The wolf game is an adapted

616
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:30,160
version of another game called Mafia. Yeah, I forgot to mention that. So if you

617
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:37,000
played a game called Mafia. He played a very similar game. Also, I think this game started

618
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,780
in live action form. Like it's a popular live action role playing game. A LARP. It's a fun

619
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:45,760
one night LARP-er, I think. So, something to think about there. So you might be more

620
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:49,760
familiar with this game than you think. So, fun, fun, fun. Good times.

621
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:54,540
Would that be that stupid game Poison where you're like shaking hands and stuff?

622
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:56,640
I don't know. I've never played Poison.

623
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,760
there's one person that's like the thief or whatever

624
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:03,360
and they're shaking hands and after you shake hands with someone that's

625
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:07,440
basically, the way you shake in their hand you put your middle finger out and

626
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:07,760
like

627
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:11,160
touch their wrist or whatever while you're doing it kind of like you know

628
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:14,240
it's basically like you're injecting them with

629
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:18,120
poison and then 10 seconds after you do that or whatever or like

630
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:21,200
there's so much of a delay then they fall over and die

631
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:25,200
and it's a drama game that you used to play and then you're supposed to figure out who the

632
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:30,400
a thief is, or whatever. Somewhat similar. It's a slightly different setup, the game

633
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:35,800
I played, but it's similar. Similar idea. You're on the right track. All right. Only

634
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:41,680
LARP I ever did was Vampire. I never played a LARP. I played D&D in high school, like

635
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:46,920
a couple times. I wasn't like a total dork, but I had- Hey! I was a- No, but I'm just-

636
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:50,400
What dork you ever begun to do? I'm still doing tabletop gaming. There's not a problem

637
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,400
Hey, Dork Pride, yo.

638
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,400
I'm playing Buffy.

639
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,400
Buffy TV.

640
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,400
Please, please, come on.

641
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:01,400
You have to admit, Buffy roleplay is a little bit dorky.

642
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,400
But it's fun.

643
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,400
That's fine.

644
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,400
It's done like a TV episode, it's great.

645
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:11,400
As somebody who co-hosts an internet radio show dedicated to DDR, that's fine.

646
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,400
Don't make me go grudge on you.

647
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:26,400
Now I'm having a problem finding that video I wanted to show you guys, I'm so upset.

648
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,520
What else is new, Rob?

649
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,520
Speaking of problems.

650
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,520
Oh, I found it.

651
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:34,120
Okay, so we love to do Orange Launch Radio movie time because it's really funny because

652
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,120
we're a radio show.

653
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,120
You guys can't see the movie.

654
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:38,160
But the audio on this will say it all.

655
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:42,440
So what we're going to look at is a download that's available on ebombsworld.com.

656
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:46,440
It's a very popular site. It's a corporate training video for sexual harassment.

657
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:49,440
I don't know if you guys have seen this, but it's fucking funny.

658
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,440
I think I know what this is.

659
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,440
It's probably Dave Chappelle.

660
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,440
Listen to this.

661
00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:00,440
You hear about sexual harassment on TV, and it makes the headlines in newspapers.

662
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:04,440
As an employee, what do you need to know about it?

663
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:08,440
First, sexual harassment is against the law.

664
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:11,440
And it's against your company's policy.

665
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,440
So, what is sexual harassment?

666
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:16,440
Linda, you are doing a fine job here.

667
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,940
Oh, well, thank you, Steve.

668
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:21,440
But you know, you might try dressing a little sexier at work.

669
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:21,940
I'm sorry?

670
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:26,440
I mean, we're talking about your job here.

671
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,440
Angel, I want you to dress a little more sexier.

672
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,940
There may be physical harassment.

673
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:32,440
Wow.

674
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,440
You're really tense today, Nancy.

675
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,440
Ow, Bill.

676
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,440
Sorry.

677
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,440
Dude, Bill has no sense of hot.

678
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:42,120
I really don't like it when you do that. Can you please stop?

679
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:45,480
Dude, Bill, that's a dude.

680
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:49,120
I'd be decking him. Because she looks like she's going to cry.

681
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:53,160
Bill, that's a dude! Verbal has to be great.

682
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:56,920
Word around the office is you've got a fat cock.

683
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,600
Yes, I do.

684
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:01,200
I've got a fat cock too.

685
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:04,520
Maybe we should rub our fat cocks together sometime.

686
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:06,280
Maybe a little oil.

687
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,840
Two fat cocks.

688
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:12,040
together, oil.

689
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:15,440
It might be visual harassment such as derogatory posters,

690
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:19,040
cartoons, or drawings.

691
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:23,040
They have a little inflated penis on the desk.

692
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:27,140
It may be the result of a power struggle between a manager and a subordinate.

693
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:33,840
Man, I could go for a power fuck right now.

694
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:37,520
change is slow and what was acceptable and here's the best part is the best part

695
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:41,280
of the whole video ago can now be sexual harassment

696
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:48,400
smells like vagina in here excuse me smells like fresh vagina in here are you

697
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:55,520
talking about my vagina maybe everyone wants to be treated fairly and with

698
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:59,720
respect are you talking about my vagina with the courtesy and respect that you

699
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:05,480
you want for yourself. It's your company's policy, and it's the law.

700
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:14,480
Ebaumsworld.com, E-B-A-U-M-S world dot com. Funniest damn thing I've seen all week, honestly.

701
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:18,280
That was great. Seriously, it's basically what they did. I think they spliced, like,

702
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:23,120
a real video with those, like, fake clips. Funny. Funny stuff. Love it.

703
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:25,760
I'm... we're gonna pass it around at work now.

704
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:31,200
Are you talking about my vagina?

705
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:36,740
Maybe. Thank you, Paul, if you're listening. Paul's the one who sent that to me.

706
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:41,120
What a nice guy. I've seen that one. Alright. For those of you guys that were good

707
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:44,720
enough to sit through that Orange Lawns Radio Movie Time, I've got a special treat for

708
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:45,840
you. We have

709
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:49,480
a new song from We Love Katamari,

710
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:52,960
the Japanese version. A buddy of mine picked it up and did a rip

711
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:56,260
of the opening song. So you want to hear what this sounds like? One of the new songs from

712
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:57,220
We Heart Katamari?

713
00:42:57,220 --> 00:43:00,220
Please, here it is. It's only a minute long, it's the introduction, here it is.

714
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:29,220
I can't reach the sunshine

715
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:36,220
Na na na na na na na na na na

716
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:38,220
Katamari on the swing

717
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:45,220
Na na na na na na na na na na

718
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:47,220
Katamari on the swing

719
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:52,220
Iwa, hajima, luyo, iwi, ito

720
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:57,740
Fuck it all, yeah, you can't lose my love, baby

721
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:23,660
Seriously, you can't.

722
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:25,460
You can't.

723
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:27,180
The sequels are never as good as the original.

724
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:28,460
Well, the game might.

725
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:31,220
Games are sometimes the exception of the rule there.

726
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:32,900
Anyway, let me play just a little clip.

727
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:34,620
This song is like six and a half minutes long, so I'm not

728
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:35,980
going to subject you to this whole thing.

729
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:36,940
But you have to hear this.

730
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:40,940
This sounds like a guy that did a bunch of DER songs.

731
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:41,300
It's not.

732
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:42,100
It's actually a different guy.

733
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:44,660
But this is a Japanese beatboxer guy.

734
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:47,420
And this is the training music in We Heart Katamari.

735
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:48,780
I'm only going to play a little clip of this, because

736
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:49,540
it's very long.

737
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:56,540
but here it is

738
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:26,540
All right, you guys get the idea.

739
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:52,660
I think that's funny, that's so cute.

740
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:53,660
I need that.

741
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:54,660
So that's the training mode.

742
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:55,660
I'll send it to you later.

743
00:45:55,660 --> 00:45:58,580
For those of you guys, we have this poor guy in the chat room that's like,

744
00:45:58,580 --> 00:45:59,580
what is Katamari?

745
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:02,340
What the hell is this?

746
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:05,660
It was kind of a, I guess you'd call it a sleeper hit on the PlayStation 2,

747
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:07,220
Katamari Damacy.

748
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:10,240
Concept is, you're this little guy and you have a big ball and you roll it

749
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:13,800
around and your ball is sticky and it just picks everything up.

750
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:17,100
So you start out and you're rolling over like gumdrops and thumbtacks,

751
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:22,800
And then suddenly you're running over small animals and like then you're running over people and cars and cities and rainbows

752
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:30,080
It's beautiful beautiful game. Um, I can't really call it like an underground hit now because I think tons of people found out about this

753
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:34,520
Game, it's almost mainstream now. I wanted to say though about that Japanese beatboxing

754
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:39,520
It totally reminds me, that song there, of something from Bjork's latest album.

755
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:53,520
This is the whole Bjork album. I don't know when I heard that, I was like, I don't know.

756
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:55,520
Forget it.

757
00:46:55,520 --> 00:47:03,520
Just a word to our listeners. I posted in the chatroom the Japanese katamari damashi.

758
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:08,520
Minagareisuki katamari damashi is up.

759
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:10,520
And what does that translate to in English?

760
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:13,520
Everybody loves katamari.

761
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:16,520
Beautiful game, beautiful game.

762
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:21,520
Alright, so we'll be looking at that. Oh, I love this. Our chatroom is going,

763
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:27,680
going, um, I have a fat katamari. We should rub our katamaris together sometime. It smells

764
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:37,680
like katamari in here. Is that your katamari? Maybe. Oh, chat room, you so funny. You so

765
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:44,800
funny. Me laugh longer. Oh, I actually like the, it's the flashlight. It's kind of cute.

766
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:50,880
Alright. Information. Oh, it's about time we start talking about that four panel dancing

767
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:54,880
Alright, you want to get into the news? Fine, we'll get into the news.

768
00:47:54,880 --> 00:48:04,880
Alright, so, if you haven't heard yet, you might remember when we were talking about this on the show a few weeks ago, because it was huge news.

769
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:14,880
And that was when Konami first filed the suit against, I keep wanting to say Anamiro, but that's not true, it's Rockzor Games, against In the Groove.

770
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:18,680
and most people were saying that it has to do with the fact

771
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:24,000
that what the box or the system that runs in the groove does is it kind of

772
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:28,080
stows away in a regular DDR machine and Konami was saying that this was

773
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:30,960
infringing on their trademarks and their patents because people would

774
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:35,680
apply the in the groove stickers but they do a sloppy job of it so you would still see

775
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:38,360
distinctive parts of a DDR machine underneath

776
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:42,480
and it's ruining DDR because in the groove according to the lawsuit you may

777
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:43,360
feel differently

778
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:47,600
is a subpar game and they're saying that you know that is

779
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:51,880
basically their lawsuit is that lazy arcade owners

780
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:55,900
could ineffectiveness make people think that this in the group game is like DDR

781
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:57,200
when in fact the games

782
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:02,040
while similar in concept to those of us hardcore fans we know the two games

783
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:05,720
definitely have their distinctive differences. And a lot of people said this

784
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:09,320
lawsuit is about the arcade only, it's not going to affect the home version, nothing's going to

785
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:09,760
happen

786
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:13,240
and I remember sitting here on the show and I said boys and girls there is an

787
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:17,220
important part of this lawsuit that addresses something called trade dress

788
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:21,540
and that one of the little things that they were suing on was the trade dress

789
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:24,340
saying that in the group not only was stowing away the machines but the game

790
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:29,800
itself looked like felt like DDR but I don't know people just seem to ignore

791
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:34,860
that they were saying arcane only arcane only well sure enough a an amended

792
00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:40,000
version of the lawsuit was filed against Roxor on July 1st and now they've

793
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:45,360
included red octane as part of their lawsuit and they actually have a press

794
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:48,420
release over on their site we have it linked from our site over at orange

795
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:56,160
lounge radio.com basically what it's saying is that um where is it where is

796
00:49:56,160 --> 00:50:00,080
it oh that's the original lawsuit I'm looking at I want to look at the new one

797
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:05,840
let's see here we go it says in addition to the prior counts of the original

798
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:08,920
complaint in which Konami seeks an injunction and damages against rock

799
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:12,380
source in the groove arcade dance simulation game the amended complaint

800
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:16,420
encompasses the recently released home version of rock source in the groove

801
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:20,580
game the amended complaint further includes patent infringement complaints

802
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:23,860
against red octane which is the publisher of the home version of in the

803
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:27,540
groove so very interesting before we get to the second part of this very

804
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:33,620
interesting because you know this isn't just about the arcade mixes anymore this

805
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:37,140
is about in the groove is too damn much like DDR basically is what this boils

806
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:42,580
sound in my opinion. No! We haven't seen, yeah I know, no shit huh? We haven't seen

807
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:49,860
the specific court documentations yet. Last time DDR Freak went into the government systems

808
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:54,140
and actually pulled the original files out. They haven't done that yet for this amendment.

809
00:50:54,140 --> 00:50:57,980
I don't know if it doesn't exist. You can't find it. I will hunt for it later on because

810
00:50:57,980 --> 00:51:02,140
I think I know where to go. See if we can find it. But we don't have the exact document

811
00:51:02,140 --> 00:51:05,260
so we haven't been able to read in too much besides what Konami's press release is saying

812
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:10,380
which of course is one-sided. But the interesting part about this, they didn't

813
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:14,060
just file against Red Octane. The sentence I was reading goes on to say

814
00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:18,940
they have also complained against Mad Cats, which is the publisher of the game

815
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:24,180
MC Groove's Dance Craze. All these additional counts are based upon the

816
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:27,740
accused game's infringement of Konami's patent rights in its Dance Dance

817
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:30,460
Revolution arcade game. Now what's interesting about this, those of you guys

818
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:33,280
that have played the Mad Cats game or even looked at screenshots and know

819
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:38,780
something about it know that yes it's a dance game but it's the sim the

820
00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:44,860
differences between the dance dance craze and DDR I think are a little more

821
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:47,820
so than the differences between in the groove and DDR because of the fact that

822
00:51:47,820 --> 00:51:52,860
MC grooves dance craze basically sucks my balls I mean it's an awful game long

823
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:56,340
version song steps that don't even go to the beat they switch the order of the

824
00:51:56,340 --> 00:51:59,340
arrows and they have that gyroscope motors I don't know what the hell it was

825
00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:03,780
it was a piece of crap but they're getting sued now too over this which is very

826
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:10,740
interesting needless to say the crack smoking mode I guess what do you guys

827
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:13,300
think about this I know you guys had very strong opinions the first time

828
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:16,900
around I'm sure this just reinforces those but I'm curious I was waiting for

829
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:22,420
it to happen I was really waiting for it to happen and pretty much glad glad it is

830
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:27,420
so far you know that's honestly these people think that just because Konami is

831
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:32,380
sitting on their ass not getting our games out means that they can do it for them, but

832
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:40,380
hopefully I have a vague hope that this lights the fire under Konami to realize, hey, we

833
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:42,940
need new releases.

834
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:47,500
Well, they're doing a lot for the home, and I'm kind of...

835
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:51,020
No, we need arcade mixes.

836
00:52:51,020 --> 00:52:52,380
I'm not going to disagree with you.

837
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:54,460
We need new arcade mixes, definitely.

838
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:58,700
Konami's focus is the home release right now and they are making a lot of money

839
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:01,060
off the home releases and I think they're trying to protect that which

840
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:06,480
makes sense to me. I said before and I'll say it again that I'm convinced that the

841
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:10,380
reason why this whole thing happened in the first place is because In the Groove

842
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:14,140
crossed that line and decided to invade the home market which is Konami's turf

843
00:53:14,140 --> 00:53:17,260
right now so this whole thing I think we've been working up to this the whole

844
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:21,300
time. This doesn't surprise me one bit and I think even the In the Groove

845
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:25,520
hardcore fan base the rabid fam is even I think at least from the reaction I'm

846
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:29,960
reading on DDR freaks forums even they're starting to say you know what

847
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:33,240
yeah okay it's no big surprise but the big beef that I'm hearing from the in

848
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:37,140
the groove crowd tell me what you guys think about this is the fact that Konami

849
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:42,440
is not releasing product anymore here's rocks or attempting to improve upon that

850
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:45,520
product despite how you feel about in the groove itself they are attempt

851
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:49,840
attempting to keep it going in the arcade they're trying to fill a void and

852
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:52,520
make money at the same time.

853
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:54,800
I mean, I really think that that's it.

854
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:57,400
I think, though, I'm of the school of thought, though,

855
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:01,400
that while the rock sore corporate group may be in this

856
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:04,080
for the money, I think the people that started this whole

857
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:06,040
thing, I mean, they were DDR fans when they started it.

858
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:08,740
I think they had good intentions at heart.

859
00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:14,080
I think they wanted to keep the arcade's fan base alive.

860
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:16,120
And they really wanted to keep this game going, because it

861
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:18,280
didn't seem like Konami gave a crap anymore.

862
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:21,720
So I think they had the best intentions at heart, I just think it's one of those things

863
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:25,320
where it might have gotten too far ahead of itself.

864
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:30,920
It's a fan thing that rolled down the hill too fast and just became bigger than it could

865
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:31,920
handle.

866
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:35,080
I don't know, that's my take on it all.

867
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:38,560
So what do you guys think, Loki?

868
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:46,300
I think the game still sucks and they're not going to make any money and Rockstar's going

869
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:47,300
under.

870
00:54:47,300 --> 00:55:16,300
No, I haven't played this MCDanceCrate thing, but it's like, basically it comes down to this, it boils down to this. It's very similar to DDR, like, pretty much, you know, it's reskinned DDR as you want to call it. But then again, you have to also go into, like, look at the fighting games out there. I mean, Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat and stuff, they're not that different. They're pretty similar. But I guess they're different enough to where they can't sue each other over that type of stuff.

871
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:43,300
So what people need to do out there now is if you want to make a music game, feel free to do so, but just make it different enough to where people aren't, you know, I mean, come on, they weren't even trying within the groove at all to make it any different from, I mean, they're adding stuff to it, whoopity-doo, and they made the arrows come not quite straight up, but you can change them so they're that way, and they sort of change the way the arrows look. That's not enough.

872
00:55:43,300 --> 00:56:06,300
That's like, you know, taking a Honda Civic out there, painting it a different color, and adding a spoiler to it, and calling it, you know, a, uh, a, um, Loki's Fast Car, you know, or something like that. It doesn't work. It's the same damn thing. So that's why I think about that.

873
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:11,500
Angel, as someone who I think, I get the impression from you anyway, you respect both games and

874
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:17,020
you, you, you, you're kinda like me, I'm, I'm, I'm not like whoop-a-dee-doo over in

875
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:21,180
the groove, but for me it's filling a void that Konami isn't giving us right now with

876
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:26,860
the arcade mixes and I'm, I'm content with it, um, it's, it's, it's there, I play it,

877
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:31,540
it's cool, I love the USB support, but I completely understand where Konami's coming from on this,

878
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:34,020
I think they're just protecting their own shit, what do you think about this?

879
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:58,020
No, no, no. He hit the nail on the head there and I do, you know, I do agree with Jamie as far as, you know, I knew it was going to happen. It was just a matter of when and it's happened now. So, you know, we just got to wait to see what happens. But I do think that Redoctane is still selling it on their site as far as I know or as far as I've seen. I don't know.

880
00:56:58,020 --> 00:57:00,020
Yeah, you might want to, seriously, you might want to run out and get this game.

881
00:57:00,020 --> 00:57:02,020
Might want to run out and get it now.

882
00:57:02,020 --> 00:57:04,020
It could be a collector's item, but nothing else, that's for sure.

883
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:21,020
Yeah, so, um, yeah, so, you know, Rob's right, just pick it up if you haven't picked it up yet, if you think it's, you know, not going to be sold anymore because of the whole, this whole thing, so, yeah.

884
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:27,020
I mean, I pretty much, I have respect for both games, so I can't really say much, but I knew it was going to happen eventually.

885
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:30,220
I think you're kinda the same school of thought that I am.

886
00:57:30,220 --> 00:57:36,020
Yeah. But who the hell wants to play that Mad Catz game anyway? Ew!

887
00:57:36,020 --> 00:57:40,900
I know, the Mad Catz thing is kind of a weird curveball in this whole thing. Anything with the Mad Catz name on it is a festering

888
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:43,540
pile of dog poo, just like my old apartment complex.

889
00:57:43,540 --> 00:57:48,260
I think the Mad Catz thing throws a very interesting curveball into this whole thing

890
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:49,340
because I think what every

891
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:53,540
everybody is noticing is that Andamiro, not named in this whole thing, but of

892
00:57:53,540 --> 00:57:54,540
course you have to remember

893
00:57:54,540 --> 00:57:58,020
Anemiro and Konami kind of have this history of going back and forth and they

894
00:57:58,020 --> 00:58:02,540
settled supposedly a long time ago so this is why Anemiro is not being touched

895
00:58:02,540 --> 00:58:06,100
which is interesting because now people are going how does this affect In the Groove 2?

896
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:10,800
honestly people I don't know and I'm not going to speculate anymore

897
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:14,320
I don't know how this is going to affect In the Groove 2 and you know what you don't either

898
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:19,660
nobody does we'll find out a lot of it has to do with how this is going to go

899
00:58:19,660 --> 00:58:24,660
So, I kind of refuse to speculate anymore on what's going to happen with In the Groove 2,

900
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:28,660
because this whole thing has become such a damn mess that it's hard to say what's going to happen.

901
00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:33,660
Just play the game while you can and hope it's still there tomorrow. Enjoy it while it lasts.

902
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:38,660
And if it lasts a long time, great. I guess that's all I can say on that.

903
00:58:38,660 --> 00:58:44,660
Any other thoughts? Is this going to make you low-key finally run out and get a copy of In the Groove

904
00:58:44,660 --> 00:58:46,660
so you can have a home mix of it?

905
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:52,660
Yo, honestly, I thought about doing that today to pick up In The Groove just so I can play it and officially say I hate it.

906
00:58:52,660 --> 00:58:57,660
Um, and then, then, then sign on the actual, and I'm probably still gonna do this.

907
00:58:57,660 --> 00:59:03,660
I'm gonna get a copy of In The Groove, say I hate it after I review it, and I know I will hate it.

908
00:59:03,660 --> 00:59:09,660
And then I will officially sign the copy with, this game fucking sucks, and then we'll give it away on the show.

909
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:14,660
Okay, if you say so.

910
00:59:14,660 --> 00:59:19,660
That's what we're gonna do. I'm planning on... I'll go pick one up this week, honestly.

911
00:59:19,660 --> 00:59:22,660
Jamie, sound like a giveaway idea to you?

912
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:26,660
Why not? I'll sign on it. Um, I would...

913
00:59:26,660 --> 00:59:28,660
I don't know, I wouldn't want to...

914
00:59:28,660 --> 00:59:30,660
Don't worry, you have a week to think about what you will say.

915
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:35,660
Alright, we'll all put something on there. I will put something borderline respectful, at least, on here, unlike some people.

916
00:59:35,660 --> 00:59:37,660
Dude, this game smells like vagina.

917
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:40,660
You guys are awful.

918
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:45,140
It'll be a collector's item.

919
00:59:45,140 --> 00:59:46,140
I know.

920
00:59:46,140 --> 00:59:47,140
I'll go on eBay.

921
00:59:47,140 --> 00:59:49,140
Are you talking about...

922
00:59:49,140 --> 00:59:50,140
I'll make even...

923
00:59:50,140 --> 00:59:55,380
I'll write comments in the manual too, you know, saying, this game is no way like DDR!

924
00:59:55,380 --> 00:59:56,380
What are you talking about?

925
00:59:56,380 --> 00:59:57,380
Anyways.

926
00:59:57,380 --> 00:59:58,380
Loki, Loki, Loki.

927
00:59:58,380 --> 01:00:02,580
Alright, so, either way, somebody's going to be pissed off, no matter what the result

928
01:00:02,580 --> 01:00:03,580
of this thing.

929
01:00:03,580 --> 01:00:07,420
I mean, even if In the Groove keeps going on, the DDR fans will be pissed off, and if

930
01:00:07,420 --> 01:00:11,060
the In The Groove production stops, the In The Groove fans will be pissed off.

931
01:00:11,060 --> 01:00:15,900
Do you think, though, that if Konami turns out another arcade mix, that it'll appease

932
01:00:15,900 --> 01:00:21,260
people and maybe they'll go, oh, OK, so Konami was working on something this whole time,

933
01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:22,540
now this whole lawsuit makes sense?

934
01:00:22,540 --> 01:00:24,460
Do you think that's going to appease people?

935
01:00:24,460 --> 01:00:25,860
Of course, nothing's going to appease everybody.

936
01:00:25,860 --> 01:00:32,500
They're going to have to, honestly, because they're going to get a lot of pretty outraged

937
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:33,620
meal over this.

938
01:00:33,620 --> 01:00:35,860
They're going to have to do something drastic.

939
01:00:35,860 --> 01:00:41,540
Honestly, they want to keep your fan base. You know what, I want to bring up a tip that

940
01:00:41,540 --> 01:00:46,540
was brought up probably about 100 episodes ago by our one and only DarkSakura. And she

941
01:00:46,540 --> 01:00:52,220
says if you really want your voice to count when it comes to dealing with Konami and you

942
01:00:52,220 --> 01:00:56,420
want to tell them that you want to see a new arcade mix and all this stuff, buy stock in

943
01:00:56,420 --> 01:01:01,540
the company. Because now when you write letters you can write them as a shareholder. Exactly.

944
01:01:01,540 --> 01:01:05,940
And they have a legal responsibility to keep their shareholders happy.

945
01:01:05,940 --> 01:01:09,020
And their stock prices are pretty, uh, level right now.

946
01:01:09,020 --> 01:01:11,760
They're not going up or down, so.

947
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:13,500
Actually it's a decent investment.

948
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:16,500
You'll at least stay stationary.

949
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:18,860
Alright, just something to think about.

950
01:01:18,860 --> 01:01:22,180
Alright kids, I think we'll go to a break and we'll come back and we'll take your calls

951
01:01:22,180 --> 01:01:24,300
on this issue if anybody wants to talk to us about it.

952
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:26,100
Loki, and then some other news.

953
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:27,100
You know what I'm pissed off about?

954
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:28,100
What?

955
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:29,100
The guy game.

956
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:30,100
They pulled it off the market completely.

957
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:31,100
Even the PC version.

958
01:01:31,100 --> 01:01:34,260
DVD out there with all the new cutscenes in it.

959
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:36,780
That's not a surprise. I thought they pulled this thing months ago.

960
01:01:36,780 --> 01:01:38,860
But my copy that...

961
01:01:38,860 --> 01:01:41,260
my purchase copy

962
01:01:41,260 --> 01:01:45,660
doesn't work anymore beyond a certain stage. So I can only play the same levels over and

963
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:48,940
over again.

964
01:01:48,940 --> 01:01:51,660
We can find it on eBay. It's supposed to be several hundred dollars.

965
01:01:51,660 --> 01:01:54,700
Ohhhh. Seventeen-year-old titties.

966
01:01:54,700 --> 01:01:56,020
Alright.

967
01:01:56,020 --> 01:01:59,780
In this break, to be fair, we will play some music from In the Groove 2 because we

968
01:01:59,780 --> 01:02:02,960
actually haven't played any of the new music from In The Groove 2, so one of our

969
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:06,440
listeners, Misty, was kind enough to hook me up, so to speak. So we're gonna play

970
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:10,840
three new tracks from In The Groove 2. We're gonna play Energizer, Vorsprung,

971
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:15,740
Durch, Techno, and Summer, the Speedy Mix. We're gonna play these songs and check

972
01:02:15,740 --> 01:02:20,300
it out, and then we'll be back with your calls in regards to this recent

973
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:27,300
development in the lawsuit world. We'll be back after this. More Orange Launch Radio.

1005
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:19,800
Now you can get it in iTunes as well. It's super.

1006
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:22,800
We are becoming Apple-ized.

1007
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:27,800
Yeah, you know, and I'm thinking about buying an Apple laptop too. I'm slowly converting to the Mac way.

1008
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:29,800
Don't you even open your damn mouth, Loki.

1009
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:40,800
That's okay. My next computer, I'm actually going to be building a new PC, but the next one I actually buy pieced is going to be one of the Mac Mini G5s.

1010
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:52,800
Don't worry, I'm not knocking your, you know, perspective purchase of a Mac product. In fact, I was actually thinking of doing my own infomercial for, you know, Macintosh and Apple products.

1011
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:53,800
Uh-huh.

1012
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:55,480
it goes a little something like this

1013
01:10:55,480 --> 01:11:01,640
do you like stuff that's pretty but does absolutely nothing that apple is for you

1014
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:06,120
because my computer purchases are based on color and not performance

1015
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:08,020
i like stuff that's smooth and shiny

1016
01:11:08,020 --> 01:11:10,080
okay and then they could sell microsoft windows

1017
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:13,760
hey kids do you like spyware

1018
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:15,360
no i'm sorry that's internet explorer

1019
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:17,360
you know what

1020
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:19,600
what

1021
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:21,520
if you work in graphics

1022
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:25,760
video editing, anything that has to do with audio-visual, a Mac is for you.

1023
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:28,480
That was a long time ago, not anymore.

1024
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:29,480
I beg to differ.

1025
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:30,480
I beg to differ as well.

1026
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:36,280
After having done my Photoshop homework on a top-line PC and then gone back and doing

1027
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:40,400
all my touch-ups on a G5, oh yeah, world of difference.

1028
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:45,720
To answer a question in chat room, a 15-inch PowerBook.

1029
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:47,120
That's why I nicknamed my penis.

1030
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:49,960
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

1031
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:55,960
I didn't hear that. Okay, I did. Never mind.

1032
01:11:55,960 --> 01:12:01,960
Let's go back to the previous topic we were talking here.

1033
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:05,960
We actually had a question from our chatroom during the break here about this whole lawsuit issue.

1034
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:10,960
Darkknight wanted to know, hey Sky, just a thought. With this revised lawsuit, what about Guitar Hero?

1035
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:15,960
Since Red Octane is publishing that game, do you think Konami will go after that as well?

1036
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:21,160
No. No. If Red Octane is still in business after this, which I think they will be, I

1037
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:25,840
don't think this is going to set them back too far, I don't think this is going to affect

1038
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:34,840
Guitar Hero at all. Had Red Octane stayed as a third party peripheral, I don't think

1039
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:40,720
Konami would have had a problem with them at all. They stepped on the toes. That's another

1040
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:44,800
very interesting thing about this whole lawsuit. Konami really hasn't been putting out their

1041
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:48,560
own pads I mean sure there's bundle packs but let's face it most of us are

1042
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:51,840
getting our pads from either red octane mad cats or one of those other countless

1043
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:56,200
DDR pad companies but mad cats and red octane admittedly being the two biggest

1044
01:12:56,200 --> 01:13:01,120
Konami suing both of them now are they gonna say well F you Konami we're not

1045
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:05,480
gonna make these pads anymore see they've gone from being like protective

1046
01:13:05,480 --> 01:13:10,180
footwear to being platform shoes that step on the toes of Konami honestly

1047
01:13:10,180 --> 01:13:15,400
though come on now red octane oh I did not know that in the groove was anything

1048
01:13:15,400 --> 01:13:19,740
like DDR no come on they knew what they're getting into when they you know

1049
01:13:19,740 --> 01:13:23,340
decided to go ahead and publish these games I mean it's retarded to say

1050
01:13:23,340 --> 01:13:26,780
otherwise and honestly they're not gonna sue them over guitar hero because a

1051
01:13:26,780 --> 01:13:30,740
guitar hero is different enough from guitar freaks to be you know its own

1052
01:13:30,740 --> 01:13:35,220
game it's more like amplitude yeah exactly since harmonix is developing it

1053
01:13:35,220 --> 01:13:39,740
it's all coach yeah exactly so I'm all for that because it actually looks good

1054
01:13:39,740 --> 01:13:43,600
They're doing stuff to improve the game. It doesn't you know try to you know copy something else

1055
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:50,540
So and of course our two of them our chat room now. I have a fat lawsuit. Let's rub our lawsuits together some time

1056
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:55,900
Lawsuit it sounds like fresh lawsuit in here. Is that your lawsuit?

1057
01:13:59,780 --> 01:14:03,180
Skypline is open boys and girls if you would like to talk to us live

1058
01:14:03,180 --> 01:14:04,700
Pick up the phone!

1059
01:14:04,700 --> 01:14:08,980
Head on over to our chat room, www.orangeloungeradio.com,

01:14:08,980 --> 01:14:10,380
and click on interact with us.

1061
01:14:10,380 --> 01:14:12,880
And that laughter there means we've already picked up a call.

1062
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:14,460
So hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1063
01:14:14,460 --> 01:14:15,620
Who dis?

1064
01:14:15,620 --> 01:14:16,340
It's Ron-Chan.

1065
01:14:16,340 --> 01:14:17,340
Who you think it is?

1066
01:14:17,340 --> 01:14:18,060
Hello, Ron-Chan.

1067
01:14:18,060 --> 01:14:19,760
We'll see I can tell by the icon,

1068
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:22,140
but the radio bit that we do is we

1069
01:14:22,140 --> 01:14:24,260
play stupid so that you introduce yourself

1070
01:14:24,260 --> 01:14:25,340
to our listeners.

1071
01:14:25,340 --> 01:14:26,820
That's how it works.

1072
01:14:26,820 --> 01:14:27,320
All right.

1073
01:14:27,320 --> 01:14:28,780
Hello.

1074
01:14:28,780 --> 01:14:29,660
Hey, Oak-Chan.

1075
01:14:29,660 --> 01:14:32,340
Ron-Chan.

1076
01:14:32,340 --> 01:14:34,940
What is up, dude?

1077
01:14:34,940 --> 01:14:36,260
What is up with Konami?

1078
01:14:36,260 --> 01:14:39,580
I swear, it's like they're trying to violate their fanbase or something

1079
01:14:39,580 --> 01:14:40,340
like that.

1080
01:14:40,340 --> 01:14:41,980
That's how I honestly feel.

1081
01:14:41,980 --> 01:14:44,540
You're a little bit choppy, but I'm going to interpret for those

1082
01:14:44,540 --> 01:14:45,900
that might have missed it there.

1083
01:14:45,900 --> 01:14:50,100
Basically, Rama's saying that they're violating their fanbase

1084
01:14:50,100 --> 01:14:51,580
with this whole thing.

1085
01:14:51,580 --> 01:14:55,460
I agree to an extent that they're pissing a lot of people off with this,

1086
01:14:55,460 --> 01:14:58,700
but at the same time, don't they have a right to protect what's theirs?

1087
01:14:58,700 --> 01:14:59,700
Yes, they do.

1088
01:14:59,700 --> 01:15:03,860
And it's sort of like, they want to be the granddaddy of the dancing games.

1089
01:15:03,860 --> 01:15:08,500
Now, here comes a bunch of new guys come along with something, and they're like, oh no, you

1090
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:09,500
can't have that.

1091
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:10,500
You must play our game only.

1092
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:11,500
Not theirs.

1093
01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:16,300
Well, but considering they did invent DDR, I mean, you could go back and say, well, there

1094
01:15:16,300 --> 01:15:22,460
was dance aerobics, but I, you know, BS, DDR is its own thing.

1095
01:15:22,460 --> 01:15:25,660
I think they're just kind of protecting what's theirs, and I think what kind of ticks people

1096
01:15:25,660 --> 01:15:28,640
off is that this is where people get pissed off.

1097
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:33,840
In The Groove probably, I may get yelled at for saying this, but In The Groove probably

1098
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:39,120
wouldn't exist if Konami had continued to put out arcade releases.

1099
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:40,120
Agreed or disagree?

1100
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:41,120
You are correct.

1101
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:42,120
I agree with you.

1102
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:43,120
Yeah.

1103
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:48,560
So, in a sense, I think where people get pissed off is that they feel like Konami abandoned

1104
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:49,560
us.

1105
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:53,240
Even though they've been doing home mixes, let's face it, the reason why the fan base

1106
01:15:53,240 --> 01:15:58,940
is so large is because we had arcade tournaments and arcade freestyle competitions, all these

1107
01:15:58,940 --> 01:16:00,440
things going on in the arcade.

1108
01:16:00,440 --> 01:16:02,540
We were not doing this stuff in our houses.

1109
01:16:02,540 --> 01:16:06,120
We're doing it now because we don't have any other choice, but this whole thing started

1110
01:16:06,120 --> 01:16:07,760
because of the arcades.

1111
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:14,400
And the home versions, as good as they've been, are not the same thing.

1112
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:17,020
Remember when we all used to go to Roseville Golf Land on Wednesday nights, back when Roseville

1113
01:16:17,020 --> 01:16:20,500
Golf Land was cool, and we used to play DDR, we had a good old time.

1114
01:16:20,500 --> 01:16:25,460
You can't get that same feeling with a home mix, and there's people all across the nation

1115
01:16:25,460 --> 01:16:29,040
like we are that did that, and we're all excited when Max 2 came out, because you had the new

1116
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:32,780
songs unlocked, and Konami, in a sense, abandoned this.

1117
01:16:32,780 --> 01:16:37,340
But okay, now to even further contradict myself, or whatever you want to say, at the same time,

1118
01:16:37,340 --> 01:16:40,820
we were never supposed to have those games in the first place, ideally, because they

1119
01:16:40,820 --> 01:16:41,820
were Japanese mixes.

1120
01:16:41,820 --> 01:16:43,760
We weren't supposed to have them in the first place.

1121
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:47,940
But I think Konami was turning a blind eye to the whole thing because it sold home mixes

1122
01:16:47,940 --> 01:16:48,940
for them.

1123
01:16:48,940 --> 01:16:51,180
That's how it all boils down, in my opinion.

1124
01:16:51,180 --> 01:16:54,500
Yeah, and they were making money off the import games being sold over here, too.

1125
01:16:54,500 --> 01:16:55,980
That's all it was.

1126
01:16:55,980 --> 01:16:56,820
Yeah.

1127
01:16:56,820 --> 01:16:57,620
Yeah.

1128
01:16:57,620 --> 01:17:00,980
Although, but then let's look at the reality of this, though.

1129
01:17:00,980 --> 01:17:03,560
Let's look at where DDR is at now.

1130
01:17:03,560 --> 01:17:05,820
Where is DDR making all the money now?

1131
01:17:05,820 --> 01:17:08,140
DDR is making all its money on the home mixes, right?

1132
01:17:08,140 --> 01:17:10,900
Konami sends out this press release in January saying, hey,

1133
01:17:10,900 --> 01:17:11,940
look how big our dick is.

1134
01:17:11,940 --> 01:17:15,140
We sold a million copies of the home versions of DDR today.

1135
01:17:15,140 --> 01:17:17,180
We are so freaking rad.

1136
01:17:17,180 --> 01:17:23,580
So Konami's bread and butter right now is the home mixes of DDR.

1137
01:17:23,580 --> 01:17:28,060
So now here comes this game that's infringing on the home mixes, which we'll refer to as

1138
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:33,520
I can't believe it's not butter, and now Konami's ticked off.

1139
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:36,820
I think that's just kind of where this all boils down from.

1140
01:17:36,820 --> 01:17:43,140
But the percentage of people who are arcade rabid fandom-ness is actually, even though

1141
01:17:43,140 --> 01:17:49,220
consider the DDR Freak has 50,000 members. ITG Freak, not as many. Like it or not,

1142
01:17:49,220 --> 01:17:53,300
well I don't know how many members of ITG Freak there are offhand, but let me

1143
01:17:53,300 --> 01:17:57,420
just say, let's say 10,000. I know I think I might be overdoing it for him a little

1144
01:17:57,420 --> 01:18:03,340
bit. Let's say ITG Freak has 10,000. 10,000 out of a million is still 1%.

1145
01:18:03,340 --> 01:18:08,700
Konami can piss off 1% of its fan base and cut their losses, because Extreme 2

1146
01:18:08,700 --> 01:18:15,700
UltraMix II and UltraMix III stand to be so big that I think things are only going to get better for them.

1147
01:18:15,700 --> 01:18:18,700
I don't know. That's just kind of my perspective on it.

1148
01:18:18,700 --> 01:18:23,700
Yeah, and I completely agree with your perspective. See, personally, I'm not an ICG freak. I'm not a fanboy.

1149
01:18:23,700 --> 01:18:30,700
I like both games. I have the mixes on both sides, and I enjoy playing them, you know?

1150
01:18:30,700 --> 01:18:35,700
Overall, if it wasn't for the fact that the fans were screaming for more DDR,

1151
01:18:35,700 --> 01:18:39,620
and the group wouldn't even be here right now. I just feel that

1152
01:18:39,620 --> 01:18:43,060
you're right, Konami did ignore the fans for a while

1153
01:18:43,060 --> 01:18:46,940
some guys came along to do something, it just gave them a reason to

1154
01:18:46,940 --> 01:18:50,100
basically they just woke the sleeping bear

1155
01:18:50,100 --> 01:18:55,900
by the way I way overshot it just under 2,000 members on itgfreak.com right now

1156
01:18:55,900 --> 01:18:59,280
hell no. Well shit. So I mean look at that

1157
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:02,380
I mean one-fifth of a percent

1158
01:19:02,380 --> 01:19:30,380
So Konami can cut their losses by pissing off, assuming every single one of those people are pissed off, which they're not, I'm a member of itgfreak.com, I'm not pissed off, but I respect In The Groove, I respect what In The Groove was built on, it was guys like us who happen to have a little programming knowledge, who wanted, I mean, let's face it, we all have, oh god, now I'm like going off on this, we've all expressed our love for these dance games, if you want to call it that, in different ways.

1159
01:19:30,380 --> 01:19:34,680
ways. Myself, Loki Dark Soccer, we have a radio program, right? It's a damn good thing

1160
01:19:34,680 --> 01:19:42,000
that my DDREX2 never took off. These guys used what they had to build an arcade mix,

1161
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:46,060
and that was how they were going to continue on with it. So I respect where In the Groove

1162
01:19:46,060 --> 01:19:50,960
came from, and they wanted to improve on the things they thought needed improving, and

1163
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:54,280
despite the way some of us feel about the game, to these guys it's an improvement on

1164
01:19:54,280 --> 01:19:59,880
the game the problem is is it just I think got carried away and money will do

1165
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:04,640
amazing things to people and I think there was a little bit and I I apologize

1166
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:07,360
to anybody that might be on the ITG team that might be offended by this comment

1167
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:10,160
but I think there was a little bit of cockiness on their end that they were

1168
01:20:10,160 --> 01:20:13,920
gonna get away with this for forever because and I say that because on the

1169
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:18,760
message boards for the longest time people would say how is this legal and

1170
01:20:18,760 --> 01:20:22,000
And the response would be, shut up, it is.

1171
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:23,880
And now Konami's calling their bluff.

1172
01:20:23,880 --> 01:20:25,360
All right.

1173
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:29,240
Now here's my next question, something I said, somebody has mentioned in the chat room earlier.

1174
01:20:29,240 --> 01:20:33,600
Now that Konami's going after Red Octane and Mad Catz, do you think they'll also go after

1175
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:38,800
the creators of Step Mania, even though it's something free to give away?

1176
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:47,440
Technically, they kind of already are, if you want to go in the school of thought that

1177
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:53,320
in the Groove is based off of StepMania, but as for the StepMania PC itself, I don't think

1178
01:20:53,320 --> 01:20:57,100
they're going to. I think because of the fact that StepMania is open source and they're

1179
01:20:57,100 --> 01:21:00,920
not making a dime off it, I think it makes it a little harder to get, if you know what

1180
01:21:00,920 --> 01:21:07,040
I mean. And I think, again, StepMania is so underground, they're not putting StepMania

1181
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:13,640
in stores. So I think for that reason, StepMania has been able to stay under the radar, even

1182
01:21:13,640 --> 01:21:17,140
Even though most of the Rabid fanbase knows about it, StepMania in many senses is still

1183
01:21:17,140 --> 01:21:21,580
a little bit under the radar when it comes into the whole big corporate scheme of things.

1184
01:21:21,580 --> 01:21:26,820
So I think they've been able to dodge the bullet for a while now and I don't see them

1185
01:21:26,820 --> 01:21:30,860
suddenly becoming a target, but the minute they try to make money off of it, I think

1186
01:21:30,860 --> 01:21:33,140
it will be a target.

1187
01:21:33,140 --> 01:21:34,140
And you're right, Loki.

1188
01:21:34,140 --> 01:21:36,460
It's probably for the best that your machine never did take off because you'd be in the

1189
01:21:36,460 --> 01:21:37,460
same boat right now.

1190
01:21:37,460 --> 01:21:39,540
Actually, no, it wouldn't matter because it's one arcade.

1191
01:21:39,540 --> 01:21:40,540
It'd be their fault.

1192
01:21:40,540 --> 01:21:46,220
if it took off and etcetera. So, I'm not that dumb.

1193
01:21:46,220 --> 01:21:50,620
So any other thoughts for us, Rama? Well, I'll tell you this, the way this lawsuit

1194
01:21:50,620 --> 01:21:54,740
is going, if Konami says cease and desist on ITG, those copies are going to be worth

1195
01:21:54,740 --> 01:21:59,660
a lot of money in the next few weeks. It's going to be the new Tengan Tetris is

1196
01:21:59,660 --> 01:22:02,500
what it is. Exactly what I was thinking.

1197
01:22:02,500 --> 01:22:06,420
All right. Well, have a good one, Rama. Thanks for giving us a call and giving us your opinion.

1198
01:22:06,420 --> 01:22:08,500
We appreciate it, okay? From?

1199
01:22:08,500 --> 01:22:09,500
Later!

1200
01:22:09,500 --> 01:22:10,500
Later!

1201
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:14,600
Speaking of Rama, I think he's one of our East Coast listeners, in fact I know he is,

1202
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:16,980
one of our East Coast listeners, and that reminds me, I was going to mention this, by

1203
01:22:16,980 --> 01:22:21,580
the way, our Skype line is open, orangelaunchradio.com, click on interact with us, and you too can

1204
01:22:21,580 --> 01:22:24,220
give us a call on the Skype line.

1205
01:22:24,220 --> 01:22:27,580
That reminds me, I'm actually going to be out there for a DDR tournament, and get this,

1206
01:22:27,580 --> 01:22:30,580
I haven't been to, it's actually a DDR slash in the group tournament, and get this, I haven't

1207
01:22:30,580 --> 01:22:34,000
been to like a DDR tournament since March Madness, like last year, so it's been a long

1208
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:37,320
time, but I figured since I'm going to be on the East Coast anyway for work-related

1209
01:22:37,320 --> 01:22:41,240
things my day job I might as well go ahead and say hello to the folks at the

1210
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:45,480
tournament on the East Coast so assuming that this tournament actually happens

1211
01:22:45,480 --> 01:22:48,200
because there hasn't been a whole lot of activity on the forums but I'm planning

1212
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:55,200
on it it's taken place over at 8 on the break and it's happening on August 7th

1213
01:22:55,200 --> 01:23:02,800
and it's called what is the cotc3 champions of the coast is what it's

1214
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:06,080
called that's happening at 8 on the break on August 7th I will be there

1215
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:09,680
signing autographs and taking pictures. No, I'm kidding. You guys don't care, but I do

1216
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:12,840
want to meet some of our East Coast listeners, so if you're in the area, stop

1217
01:23:12,840 --> 01:23:19,040
on by and say hello. I have an idea for a game. It's called Hyper Italian Siblings.

1218
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:25,760
It's basically gonna be a platform game, you know, starring two, you know, funny, you

1219
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:32,040
know, air conditioning repairmen, and they're gonna be saving some chick in

1220
01:23:32,040 --> 01:23:37,260
in the fungus land. Do you think I'm going to get sued by Nintendo for copying Mario

1221
01:23:37,260 --> 01:23:41,620
Brothers? Because it's a completely original idea. I'm just changing the sprites and everything

1222
01:23:41,620 --> 01:23:45,020
so it looks nothing like Mario, but sort of is Mario.

1223
01:23:45,020 --> 01:23:48,500
Loki, it's funny you bring that up. Have you ever heard of a game on the Commodore 64 called

1224
01:23:48,500 --> 01:23:56,340
The Great Giana Sisters? Yeah. It was basically that. Except they replaced a Mario and Luigi

1225
01:23:56,340 --> 01:24:01,420
with little spiky haired females and needless to say Nintendo filed against them. And when

1226
01:24:01,420 --> 01:24:06,820
people compare, people always are comparing In the Groove and DDR saying

1227
01:24:06,820 --> 01:24:11,780
it's Street Fighter versus Mortal Kombat, right? Mortal Kombat and Street

1228
01:24:11,780 --> 01:24:16,060
Fighter are both fighting games and In the Groove and DDR are both dancing games

1229
01:24:16,060 --> 01:24:21,620
and to me when I look at these games I go no it's a little more like Mario and

1230
01:24:21,620 --> 01:24:25,500
Great Giana Sisters, you know? Great Giana Sisters has some things that Mario

1231
01:24:25,500 --> 01:24:28,540
didn't. Great Giana Sisters has better background music than Mario Brothers, I

1232
01:24:28,540 --> 01:24:32,260
would go that far to say that. It may not be as memorable to a lot of people, but Great

1233
01:24:32,260 --> 01:24:36,900
Gianna Sisters has some fantastic background music in it, and just a slightly different

1234
01:24:36,900 --> 01:24:41,680
gameplay. So the games were slightly different, but not enough. I mean, it was, when you played

1235
01:24:41,680 --> 01:24:44,700
it, you were still like, wow, this is frickin' Mario Brothers.

1236
01:24:44,700 --> 01:24:50,540
You know what I was watching today? I was watching on, was it Nickelodeon Gas, their

1237
01:24:50,540 --> 01:24:56,620
games and sports network or whatever? They had reruns of Finders Keepers, and one of

1238
01:24:56,620 --> 01:25:02,140
the grand prizes on there was a Nintendo Entertainment System with the power pad.

1239
01:25:02,140 --> 01:25:03,140
That is awesome.

1240
01:25:03,140 --> 01:25:05,660
I was like, oh my god, that's sweet.

1241
01:25:05,660 --> 01:25:09,980
Alright, not a lot of calls left on the Skype line, so I'm getting the sense that you people

1242
01:25:09,980 --> 01:25:13,860
are sick of talking about this, which is fine, but you know what?

1243
01:25:13,860 --> 01:25:18,540
It's going to affect the future of this whole dance game scene, so just, you know, keep

1244
01:25:18,540 --> 01:25:19,540
your eye on this.

1245
01:25:19,540 --> 01:25:20,540
Loki.

1246
01:25:20,540 --> 01:25:23,220
I was going to say, it's time to talk about Paris Hilton and-

1247
01:25:23,220 --> 01:25:24,220
No, no, no.

1248
01:25:24,220 --> 01:25:25,220
We'll open the Skype line.

1249
01:25:25,220 --> 01:25:28,460
the skype line up for any new celebrity instead of Paris Hilton.

1250
01:25:28,460 --> 01:25:31,620
Lindsay Lohan! Lindsay Lohan, I agree.

1251
01:25:31,620 --> 01:25:36,460
No, no. That's the point! We're not going to talk about anybody respecting that.

1252
01:25:36,460 --> 01:25:40,460
How about Ben Affleck and Jennifer whatever? They can still call him Ben Affleck.

1253
01:25:40,460 --> 01:25:42,580
Are they back together? They can still call him Ben-ifer.

1254
01:25:42,580 --> 01:25:46,500
Wait, wait, wait, are they back together? The new Jennifer.

1255
01:25:46,500 --> 01:25:52,500
Oh. Not J-Lo. No, J-ho or something.

1256
01:25:52,500 --> 01:25:56,500
Alright. Actually, we are getting another call, so I'll go ahead and go to the Skyblind and take this.

1257
01:25:56,500 --> 01:25:59,500
Hello, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.

1258
01:25:59,500 --> 01:26:01,500
Hey, what's up? This is DeepThought42.

1259
01:26:01,500 --> 01:26:04,500
Hello, Deep... Did you say DeepThroat42?

1260
01:26:04,500 --> 01:26:05,500
DeepThought42.

1261
01:26:05,500 --> 01:26:08,500
That's just teasing. DeepThought42, how you doing?

1262
01:26:08,500 --> 01:26:09,500
Am I echoing this week?

1263
01:26:09,500 --> 01:26:13,500
No, you sound really good this week, so whatever you did fixed up, so good job.

1264
01:26:13,500 --> 01:26:15,500
I plugged in my headphones.

1265
01:26:15,500 --> 01:26:16,500
Ah.

1266
01:26:16,500 --> 01:26:18,500
Wonderful, wonderful bit of technology that that is.

1267
01:26:18,500 --> 01:26:20,500
There you go. That's what I had to do here.

1268
01:26:20,500 --> 01:26:21,500
What's on your mind?

1269
01:26:21,500 --> 01:26:46,500
Not much. I sent Jamie an email earlier this week because I was on GameSpot.com and I read an article which is yet another travesty in the world of GTA that politicians are ranting on about GTA, the sex mod, the hot coffee mod that's going around.

1270
01:26:46,500 --> 01:26:47,500
Oh, I heard about this.

1271
01:26:47,500 --> 01:26:50,500
Yeah, I had the article set aside to actually discuss during the podcast tonight.

1272
01:26:50,500 --> 01:26:54,500
We can touch on it. We'll get into it in more detail in the podcast.

1273
01:26:54,500 --> 01:26:58,500
Does this have to do with... I was reading something about the ESRB.

1274
01:26:58,500 --> 01:27:02,500
They're saying that it's violating the integrity of the ESRB.

1275
01:27:02,500 --> 01:27:06,500
The thing is that the company removed the...

1276
01:27:06,500 --> 01:27:10,500
You know, it's like when you get a demo out...

1277
01:27:10,500 --> 01:27:14,500
My demo of Umjamalami, for example, has every single stage in it

1278
01:27:14,500 --> 01:27:18,500
and just blocks it. Reprogram part of the code.

1279
01:27:18,500 --> 01:27:24,500
That's exactly what they did with GTA, but there are people out there...

1280
01:27:24,500 --> 01:27:28,500
They would have had to recode the entire game. It would have pushed it back months.

1281
01:27:28,500 --> 01:27:33,500
If they had actually removed it from the game. It's in the PS2 version.

1282
01:27:33,500 --> 01:27:34,500
Yeah.

1283
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:41,500
But instead of pushing it back five months to recode the entire game, they blocked it.

1284
01:27:41,500 --> 01:27:44,500
It's not their fault that someone found a way around it.

1285
01:27:44,500 --> 01:27:51,740
For example, Bloody War 3. You remember they had the, uh, the, uh, special photographs

1286
01:27:51,740 --> 01:27:55,420
hidden in the game. Accessible through the D.F.E.S. menu.

1287
01:27:55,420 --> 01:27:57,180
Okay, okay. That was awesome.

1288
01:27:57,180 --> 01:28:02,580
You know what, I, I, I think, what about, what about, what about the Sims? I mean, you've

1289
01:28:02,580 --> 01:28:06,060
got the nude patch for the Sims. I mean, that's the same thing.

1290
01:28:06,060 --> 01:28:09,200
Exactly. Well, but the nude patch was a patch. It didn't

1291
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:12,620
unlock something that was already there. Same with the hot coffee mod. It's a patch.

1292
01:28:12,620 --> 01:28:17,700
I know, I know. You know what? I totally side, and I can't believe I'm siding with Rockstar

1293
01:28:17,700 --> 01:28:22,060
on something, but I completely side with them on this because if they locked it away and

1294
01:28:22,060 --> 01:28:26,940
somebody went somewhere they shouldn't have, that's not Rockstar's problem. And I think

1295
01:28:26,940 --> 01:28:31,940
the ESRB's issue with this is they're going to look and see if, were they hiding this?

1296
01:28:31,940 --> 01:28:34,820
Were they intentionally hiding this from us when they screwed it?

1297
01:28:34,820 --> 01:28:35,820
Yeah, that's the issue.

1298
01:28:35,820 --> 01:28:36,820
And I'm going to say no.

1299
01:28:36,820 --> 01:28:37,820
That's the issue that they're looking into.

1300
01:28:37,820 --> 01:28:38,820
No, they're not that stupid.

1301
01:28:38,820 --> 01:28:42,260
Because it's only, it's only in the PC version. You can't unlock it in the Xbox.

1302
01:28:42,260 --> 01:28:45,260
No, you can unlock it in the PS2 version. Can you?

1303
01:28:45,260 --> 01:28:46,260
It's in the PS2 version.

1304
01:28:46,260 --> 01:28:47,260
Yeah, you can unlock it.

1305
01:28:47,260 --> 01:28:50,260
It's incredibly difficult to do, but you can do it.

1306
01:28:50,260 --> 01:28:52,260
Oh, but is it like a button code you put in?

1307
01:28:52,260 --> 01:28:53,260
No.

1308
01:28:53,260 --> 01:28:55,260
No, no, no. You have to download something to your memory stick.

1309
01:28:55,260 --> 01:28:56,260
Okay.

1310
01:28:56,260 --> 01:28:57,260
I know, I haven't done it.

1311
01:28:57,260 --> 01:28:58,260
That's hacking.

1312
01:28:58,260 --> 01:28:59,260
I'm not so interested.

1313
01:28:59,260 --> 01:29:00,260
That's, yeah, I know exactly.

1314
01:29:00,260 --> 01:29:04,260
The Blanks people will go to see some titties in their games, please.

1315
01:29:04,260 --> 01:29:08,260
Go play some Custer's Revenge, people.

1316
01:29:08,260 --> 01:29:14,100
people. You know what? Right there you're talking about hacking though. You're going

1317
01:29:14,100 --> 01:29:17,580
on the internet and you're talking about really, you're talking about violating the license

1318
01:29:17,580 --> 01:29:21,940
agreement when you open the box and buy the game. The part of the license agreement says

1319
01:29:21,940 --> 01:29:26,220
you will not fuck with the game. And you're violating the license agreement. So I think

1320
01:29:26,220 --> 01:29:29,660
Rockstar's base is covered and I think through this whole investigation. But of course...

1321
01:29:29,660 --> 01:29:34,860
And Rockstar has gone through so much shit in the past couple years by fucking parents

1322
01:29:34,860 --> 01:29:43,680
ruining this country, that they're not that stupid, you know, they wouldn't do something

1323
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:44,680
like that intentionally.

1324
01:29:44,680 --> 01:29:48,480
They saw the minigame and they were like, you know what, this is crossing a line that

1325
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:50,160
we don't even want to cross.

1326
01:29:50,160 --> 01:29:54,420
I agree, I have to side with Rockstar on this one, I think after the investigation it will

1327
01:29:54,420 --> 01:29:59,120
be found out this way, and the angry parents, the parents who are angry over this, lesson

1328
01:29:59,120 --> 01:30:02,640
learned, watch what your fucking kids download on the internet, because that's where they're

1329
01:30:02,640 --> 01:30:03,640
getting this whole thing in the first place.

1330
01:30:03,640 --> 01:30:14,640
I have to say, I told Jamie this, but I do, in essence, agree. If you read the article, it's all basically this one guy, his name is Leland Lee. He's a California assemblyman.

1331
01:30:14,640 --> 01:30:16,640
Those California bastards.

1332
01:30:16,640 --> 01:30:20,640
Yeah, I know. A Democrat from San Francisco. Damn it.

1333
01:30:20,640 --> 01:30:33,640
He has a law in there saying that they do need to overhaul the ESRB. I do agree with that. I do think there needs to be a PG-13 rating.

1334
01:30:33,640 --> 01:30:35,640
I agree with that too.

1335
01:30:35,640 --> 01:30:41,720
And I do, because you go from Teen, which is like Final Fantasy X, to Grand Theft Auto

1336
01:30:41,720 --> 01:30:46,260
San Andreas, you know, that's not, you know, there needs to be a PG-13, and there needs

1337
01:30:46,260 --> 01:30:51,720
to be, if you sell an M-rated game to someone under 16, it should be like selling cigarettes

1338
01:30:51,720 --> 01:30:52,720
to a minor.

1339
01:30:52,720 --> 01:30:54,920
It should be the exact same thing.

1340
01:30:54,920 --> 01:30:55,920
To an extent I agree with that.

1341
01:30:55,920 --> 01:31:00,040
I think the rules for games should mirror the rules of movies right on down to the rating

1342
01:31:00,040 --> 01:31:01,040
system.

1343
01:31:01,040 --> 01:31:02,040
Exactly.

1344
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:05,520
as much as an issue as I have with the ratings board sometimes because they'll

1345
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:08,660
they'll give a movie like War of the Worlds which showed like you know

1346
01:31:08,660 --> 01:31:15,080
flying body parts and everything and that movie gets a PG-13

1347
01:31:15,080 --> 01:31:16,720
I like flying body parts

1348
01:31:16,720 --> 01:31:20,120
I know but it still it should be R-rated but you're an adult and you can enjoy

1349
01:31:20,120 --> 01:31:21,720
flying body parts whenever you want

1350
01:31:21,720 --> 01:31:23,760
I didn't have a problem with flying body parts

1351
01:31:23,760 --> 01:31:26,680
I liked flying body parts when I was in high school

1352
01:31:26,680 --> 01:31:30,000
But here's the thing, then you take a movie like Romeo and Michelle's High School Reunion

1353
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:33,480
because they drop the F bomb three times in that movie

1354
01:31:33,480 --> 01:31:36,960
it gets an R rating. There is an inconsistency here.

1355
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:41,320
But that problem I have with the MPAA aside

1356
01:31:41,320 --> 01:31:46,360
I think the MPAA and the ESRB should work together to be using the same rating

1357
01:31:46,360 --> 01:31:47,440
system because

1358
01:31:47,440 --> 01:31:50,600
parents already identify with that PG-13

1359
01:31:50,600 --> 01:31:54,520
PGR. It's already emblazed in their brains

1360
01:31:54,520 --> 01:31:58,640
and so I think they should be just copying that.

1361
01:31:58,640 --> 01:32:03,000
singling out video games. Why are they not going to, you know,

1362
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:07,080
why are they not raging against Rob Zombie's new movie?

1363
01:32:07,080 --> 01:32:10,840
You know, why is it all about video games? And to me, I think it's

1364
01:32:10,840 --> 01:32:15,800
it's the government is trying to, I mean, not to get all politic, you know,

1365
01:32:15,800 --> 01:32:18,840
conspiracy theory on you, but I think it's just

1366
01:32:18,840 --> 01:32:22,760
them trying to say, what is art and what is not?

1367
01:32:22,760 --> 01:32:27,520
And they're trying to say that if it's not art, then they can ban it.

1368
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:31,200
Am I totally out of... No, I'm with you.

1369
01:32:31,200 --> 01:32:35,300
I'm with you to a point here. I'm with you.

1370
01:32:35,300 --> 01:32:40,280
I don't know. That's just my... I mean, that may be a little too conspiracy theory, but I mean

1371
01:32:40,280 --> 01:32:42,320
between that and the flag burning amendment

1372
01:32:42,320 --> 01:32:45,240
and the fact that our president is going to be electing...

1373
01:32:45,240 --> 01:32:49,480
is going to be appointing not only a Supreme Court Justice but a Chief Justice,

1374
01:32:49,480 --> 01:32:52,880
all that stuff scares me right now.

1375
01:32:52,880 --> 01:32:58,960
As someone who didn't vote for our president, I can say it kind of scares me too, but we

1376
01:32:58,960 --> 01:32:59,960
just have to...

1377
01:32:59,960 --> 01:33:00,960
We need to march on Washington from this shit.

1378
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:06,760
We need to go to fucking Lafayette Park with a can of Cassine.

1379
01:33:06,760 --> 01:33:07,760
Are you talking about...

1380
01:33:07,760 --> 01:33:10,280
A bunch of flags and just be like, fuck you.

1381
01:33:10,280 --> 01:33:12,240
Are you talking about a million gamer march?

1382
01:33:12,240 --> 01:33:13,960
Is this what you're bringing up here?

1383
01:33:13,960 --> 01:33:14,960
Yes.

1384
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:15,960
A million gamer march.

1385
01:33:15,960 --> 01:33:16,960
That's what we call it.

1386
01:33:16,960 --> 01:33:18,200
Go to the floor of E3.

1387
01:33:18,200 --> 01:33:21,320
That's what it feels like sometimes, is a million gamer march.

1388
01:33:21,320 --> 01:33:23,760
No, I I can't you know what I I

1389
01:33:24,680 --> 01:33:26,720
Think someone has to do something

1390
01:33:26,720 --> 01:33:30,580
I I think parents of the world could stand to be educated on this issue a little bit more

1391
01:33:30,580 --> 01:33:37,160
But I think to as an extent I think the game should be mirroring the movies a little bit because society for whatever reason

1392
01:33:37,200 --> 01:33:40,280
We have this movie thing in blazing our head, but for video games

1393
01:33:40,280 --> 01:33:43,640
We treat it differently and for some parents video games are the babysitter

1394
01:33:44,540 --> 01:33:49,780
Yeah, and it's just different. I don't know some parents television is babysitter. Do you have you ever watched like CSI?

1395
01:33:49,780 --> 01:33:54,220
Have you ever watched like, I mean just because they don't swear doesn't mean it's not graphic.

1396
01:33:54,220 --> 01:33:55,220
I mean that's disturbing.

1397
01:33:55,220 --> 01:33:56,220
Me personally, no.

1398
01:33:56,220 --> 01:34:00,020
I haven't watched CSI, but I have watched other shows that are just as bad.

1399
01:34:00,020 --> 01:34:01,020
Yeah.

1400
01:34:01,020 --> 01:34:04,260
In fact, I was watching a show the other day that they said shit on it, and I was like,

1401
01:34:04,260 --> 01:34:05,260
wow.

1402
01:34:05,260 --> 01:34:06,260
I mean I didn't care.

1403
01:34:06,260 --> 01:34:07,260
I thought it was funny.

1404
01:34:07,260 --> 01:34:08,260
They said shit on Friends.

1405
01:34:08,260 --> 01:34:09,260
Did they?

1406
01:34:09,260 --> 01:34:10,260
Ah, I missed that.

1407
01:34:10,260 --> 01:34:11,260
Yeah.

1408
01:34:11,260 --> 01:34:12,260
The thing is...

1409
01:34:12,260 --> 01:34:13,260
Yeah, it was one of...

1410
01:34:13,260 --> 01:34:14,260
I can't believe I know this.

1411
01:34:14,260 --> 01:34:19,620
I'm mildly embarrassing myself that I know this, but I remember it.

1412
01:34:19,620 --> 01:34:24,180
It was one of the episodes where, you know, Rachel and Ross had a little, you know, confrontation

1413
01:34:24,180 --> 01:34:26,860
and Rachel says, I'm sick of this shit.

1414
01:34:26,860 --> 01:34:29,340
Wow, I wonder how that got by sensors.

1415
01:34:29,340 --> 01:34:33,620
Anyway, Dark Sakura, I know you've got to have a comment on this because you're usually

1416
01:34:33,620 --> 01:34:36,700
pretty passionate about these issues, so I'm curious what you think on this.

1417
01:34:36,700 --> 01:34:43,140
It's more of a case of parents being stupid shits and not doing their goddamn job.

1418
01:34:43,140 --> 01:34:45,340
It comes down to that.

1419
01:34:45,340 --> 01:34:51,960
know we it's very sad that the state that our country has become where we

1420
01:34:51,960 --> 01:34:56,200
supposedly have all this freedom and you know I actually have to sort of quote

1421
01:34:56,200 --> 01:35:01,800
George Carlin last night because he said we used to be the land of the free we

1422
01:35:01,800 --> 01:35:06,840
used to have all these rights remember when we could do this I was like you

1423
01:35:06,840 --> 01:35:11,840
know that's pretty true because now you know it's like you and I were discussing

1424
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:18,480
previously, with my comment about being arrested at protesting, it doesn't matter if you've

1425
01:35:18,480 --> 01:35:25,520
got a license to be there, if it's anything that's against the current administration,

1426
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:28,020
your ass will get locked up.

1427
01:35:28,020 --> 01:35:33,600
You know where else they did that, the number of countries that were under dictatorship

1428
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:34,600
rule, huh?

1429
01:35:34,600 --> 01:35:35,600
Yeah, I know.

1430
01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:38,120
No, I totally agree with you.

1431
01:35:38,120 --> 01:35:44,120
I keep going back to the South Park movie, Blame Canada. You know that song?

1432
01:35:44,120 --> 01:35:51,120
There's all this crap. And all the freedoms that we have, all the things are being taken away.

1433
01:35:51,120 --> 01:35:55,120
This country was perfect before Nintendo came along.

1434
01:35:55,120 --> 01:36:02,120
We've gone from being ultimate Star Games. We've gone from being ultimate right wing.

1435
01:36:02,120 --> 01:36:06,120
Did you know that Hitler and Stalin used to go over to each other's house and play Mortal Kombat after school?

1436
01:36:06,120 --> 01:36:10,960
know that? You know, we've gone from being the ultimate right-wing to uber leftist

1437
01:36:10,960 --> 01:36:17,080
and it's all, you know, it's all a bunch of bullshit. Wow, well thank you.

1438
01:36:17,080 --> 01:36:21,680
Let's say we do a million gamer march. We start it here. I say we form our own planet.

1439
01:36:21,680 --> 01:36:26,520
I think the million gamer march is a freaking brilliant idea. We just need to

1440
01:36:26,520 --> 01:36:31,600
organize. But they're actually busy playing EverQuest. I'm your East Coast representation, Josie in the house.

1441
01:36:31,600 --> 01:36:38,620
But knowing the gamer community, we'll try to organize ourselves and then we'll be all,

1442
01:36:38,620 --> 01:36:39,620
ooh, new Halo.

1443
01:36:39,620 --> 01:36:40,620
Too busy, gotta go play games.

1444
01:36:40,620 --> 01:36:45,620
We'll be marching with our DS's and PSD's.

1445
01:36:45,620 --> 01:36:48,620
Hooray, I'll finally be able to find a Picto chat room.

1446
01:36:48,620 --> 01:36:51,620
Ha, I haven't found one since E3.

1447
01:36:51,620 --> 01:36:56,620
Alright, we gotta let you go, but thank you so much for calling us, it was a good topic.

1448
01:36:56,620 --> 01:36:57,620
Alright dude, take care.

1449
01:36:57,620 --> 01:36:58,620
Have a good one buddy.

1450
01:36:58,620 --> 01:36:59,620
Bye.

1451
01:36:59,620 --> 01:37:00,620
Bye.

1452
01:37:00,620 --> 01:37:09,120
That was good! I liked that. Even though that was a more general video gaming issue, you know what, I think we can do what we want on this program and we'll talk about that.

1453
01:37:09,120 --> 01:37:10,120
That's what we're about.

1454
01:37:10,120 --> 01:37:20,620
That's right. All right. I need some light in here. It's getting kind of dark. All right. I think we're going to go to a break. I'm kind of angry, so I want to hear some Taku, because I'm angry. And when I'm angry, I listen to Taku.

1455
01:37:20,620 --> 01:37:21,620
Lots of Taku.

1456
01:37:21,620 --> 01:37:29,620
Alright, so we're gonna hear some Taku, along with some other 2DX songs, because after Taku, to offset it, I have a little lovey song. I have a lovey-dovey song.

1457
01:37:29,620 --> 01:37:33,140
alright so we'll be back after this with more orange on the radio and tonight's cage

1458
01:37:33,140 --> 01:37:36,140
More news etc. etc. etc.

1459
01:39:33,140 --> 01:39:35,140
You

01:41:03,140 --> 01:41:05,140

Love

1471
01:41:48,140 --> 01:41:53,140
You were either meant to be free

1472
01:41:55,140 --> 01:42:00,140
Never killed any servant

1473
01:45:00,140 --> 01:45:17,740
And now, let's listen in to an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting as they debate some of

1474
01:45:17,740 --> 01:45:21,220
the new programming coming to Orange Lounge Radio.

1475
01:45:21,220 --> 01:45:25,780
Jamie, I have a suggestion about some of the music in our Bamani Music and More program.

1476
01:45:25,780 --> 01:45:27,000
Can we talk about that?

1477
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,100
No subject will ever be taboo.

1478
01:45:29,100 --> 01:45:35,840
Well, I was thinking maybe we should move pump up the volume from Tuesday nights except of course the subject that was just under discussion

1479
01:45:36,580 --> 01:45:42,080
Okay. Well, what would you think if maybe we cut back on some of the tack music we play on the station?

1480
01:45:42,080 --> 01:45:44,080
I collect your fucking head

1481
01:45:45,580 --> 01:45:50,180
Just like this fucker here come on fuck the other one as you in there. Oh my god

1482
01:45:50,180 --> 01:45:55,520
Why did you do that to Loki the holic thing on episode 69 was just a joke

1483
01:45:55,520 --> 01:46:03,520
Now if any of you sons of bitches got anything else to say, NOW'S THE FUCKING TIME!

1484
01:46:03,520 --> 01:46:08,520
Orange Lounge Radio, where everybody has a say.

1485
01:46:11,520 --> 01:46:15,520
You know, you know what? I really sound a lot like Lucy Liu there.

1486
01:46:15,520 --> 01:46:17,520
I'm a really good voice actor.

1487
01:46:17,520 --> 01:46:19,520
You do, you're brilliant voice actors.

1488
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:27,720
The chat room is yelling about the speaking of new programming, because there was a post

1489
01:46:27,720 --> 01:46:30,880
on our community earlier this week that said there was going to be a new show on Friday

1490
01:46:30,880 --> 01:46:32,200
night.

1491
01:46:32,200 --> 01:46:37,600
That was what we call a miscommunication, this little miscommunication between two parties.

1492
01:46:37,600 --> 01:46:41,360
But at least you know that we're working on something, so we're not just resting on our

1493
01:46:41,360 --> 01:46:42,360
laurels.

1494
01:46:42,360 --> 01:46:47,380
There is new programming being under discussion for Orange Lawn's radio as we speak.

1495
01:46:47,380 --> 01:46:48,680
So we will see what occurs.

1496
01:46:48,680 --> 01:46:53,220
And there's not just that, I know of at least three projects being worked on right now.

1497
01:46:53,220 --> 01:47:00,880
Just in short, chat room, unless it's me, or Rob, or Loki that posted it.

1498
01:47:00,880 --> 01:47:01,880
Question.

1499
01:47:01,880 --> 01:47:05,000
Unfortunately, yeah, you gotta kinda go with that rule, so.

1500
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:15,440
Yeah, if neither of us post it, or it's not listed in there, or we don't confirm it, don't,

1501
01:47:15,440 --> 01:47:17,320
not until one of us has confirmed it.

1502
01:47:17,320 --> 01:47:20,360
OrangeLawnsRadio.com too, as much as we love the live drone community, OrangeLawnsRadio.com

1503
01:47:20,360 --> 01:47:24,720
too is a great site to get all the latest news.

1504
01:47:24,720 --> 01:47:28,400
So that's that, but there's all those fun projects, and if you have an idea for a show

1505
01:47:28,400 --> 01:47:35,040
on OrangeLawnsRadio, we're not opposed to hearing what you got to offer us, so go to

1506
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:39,320
the Contact Us tab, send us an email and let us know what you have in mind, because we're

1507
01:47:39,320 --> 01:47:42,600
not opposed to new programming, so let us know.

1508
01:47:42,600 --> 01:47:49,360
OK, moving right along, I want to talk about some other news

1509
01:47:49,360 --> 01:47:51,600
going on.

1510
01:47:51,600 --> 01:47:53,080
Hey, Loki, turn off the damn game.

1511
01:47:53,080 --> 01:47:54,520
We're doing a show here.

1512
01:47:54,520 --> 01:47:56,200
Turn off the goddamn game, bastard.

1513
01:47:58,900 --> 01:48:01,440
In the Groove, the game we've been talking about earlier

1514
01:48:01,440 --> 01:48:03,840
today with the whole lawsuit business, they're

1515
01:48:03,840 --> 01:48:05,320
still trucking along.

1516
01:48:05,320 --> 01:48:07,680
They have a very interesting thing going on right now, the

1517
01:48:07,680 --> 01:48:11,040
World Wide Road Rally 2005.

1518
01:48:11,040 --> 01:48:14,140
And if you want more information on this Road Rally 2005,

1519
01:48:14,140 --> 01:48:18,620
you can visit rockswordgames.com slash road rally slash,

1520
01:48:18,620 --> 01:48:20,820
well, I'm looking, it's just rockswordgames.com

1521
01:48:20,820 --> 01:48:21,660
slash road rally.

1522
01:48:21,660 --> 01:48:24,740
I'm specifically looking at the events page right now.

1523
01:48:24,740 --> 01:48:28,020
Eight events that they're trying to get people to compete in

1524
01:48:28,020 --> 01:48:30,500
and this is like a nationwide tournament.

1525
01:48:30,500 --> 01:48:32,260
I think this is their attempt at doing some type

1526
01:48:32,260 --> 01:48:33,300
of nationwide tournament.

1527
01:48:33,300 --> 01:48:35,140
Listen to the kinds of things they have here.

1528
01:48:35,140 --> 01:48:39,660
Most locations played and you have to prove this

1529
01:48:39,660 --> 01:48:46,040
copying down ITG serial numbers most unique locations which again I think is

1530
01:48:46,040 --> 01:48:52,060
serial numbers total distance traveled how far did you go to visit locations

1531
01:48:52,060 --> 01:48:54,960
now see I might be able to win this because I'm going to be going to the

1532
01:48:54,960 --> 01:48:58,320
East Coast on a trip and I might play I in the groove to out there so maybe I

1533
01:48:58,320 --> 01:49:06,680
should start looking for a team best marathon score best team photo you email

1534
01:49:06,680 --> 01:49:13,000
them a photo and if they like it you win. Best freestyle, best costume, and best

1535
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:18,220
overall most hardcore ITG freak. Is that is that grammatically correct? Best

1536
01:49:18,220 --> 01:49:23,240
overall most hardcore ITG freak? I don't know. Regardless, if that interests you

1537
01:49:23,240 --> 01:49:27,500
head on over to rockswargames.com slash road rally. Kind of interesting the idea

1538
01:49:27,500 --> 01:49:31,280
of a national DDR tournament using pictures or video has been something

1539
01:49:31,280 --> 01:49:35,080
toyed on for quite some time so it's very interesting I think anyway that the

1540
01:49:35,080 --> 01:49:38,600
The company who puts out in the groove is endorsing this.

1541
01:49:38,600 --> 01:49:39,600
Loki your thoughts?

1542
01:49:39,600 --> 01:49:41,880
I'm sure you have some.

1543
01:49:41,880 --> 01:49:45,600
I guess it's a good idea, whatever, I mean, where are the prizes?

1544
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:47,960
Oh, I didn't even look.

1545
01:49:47,960 --> 01:49:48,960
Let's see.

1546
01:49:48,960 --> 01:49:49,960
Sorry.

1547
01:49:49,960 --> 01:49:50,960
For shame.

1548
01:49:50,960 --> 01:49:51,960
Prizes.

1549
01:49:51,960 --> 01:49:52,960
Trophies.

1550
01:49:52,960 --> 01:50:03,240
Overall, most hardcore ITG freak gets two round-trip tickets to Las Vegas for the North

1551
01:50:03,240 --> 01:50:04,240
American tournament finals.

1552
01:50:04,240 --> 01:50:10,080
finals. You get your both! Most locations get up to three packages for the winning team.

1553
01:50:10,080 --> 01:50:14,280
You basically get like a Megamix CD, a Red Octane ignition pad, a signed copy of In the

1554
01:50:14,280 --> 01:50:21,280
Groove, and participation in a lawsuit. You're bad. I'm trying to look at what else they

1555
01:50:21,280 --> 01:50:24,800
have here. I don't see a whole lot of... basically signed copies of In the Groove seem to be

1556
01:50:24,800 --> 01:50:28,640
the big prizes. Some other Red Octane goodies thrown in there for good measure as well.

1557
01:50:28,640 --> 01:50:33,160
So they're nothing to blink at, they're nothing to laugh at. They're kind of neat. Especially

1558
01:50:33,160 --> 01:50:36,920
if you're a true ITG freak, then a signed copy of the game should, you know, get a rise

1559
01:50:36,920 --> 01:50:43,920
out of you. Especially that Las Vegas thing, now that's a pretty good one there. And trophies!

1560
01:50:43,920 --> 01:50:51,920
Who loves trophies? Logie. DarkSakura. I drove to play a shitty game and all I got was this

1561
01:50:51,920 --> 01:51:00,200
stupid trophy. The trophy has a big dunce cap on it. So, let me get this straight here.

1562
01:51:00,200 --> 01:51:05,620
And in the groove is sort of a wannabe DDR.

1563
01:51:05,620 --> 01:51:10,180
So would that mean that an ITG freak would be a wannabe Bomani freak?

1564
01:51:10,180 --> 01:51:11,180
You know what?

1565
01:51:11,180 --> 01:51:12,900
Send in your application and see if you win.

1566
01:51:12,900 --> 01:51:13,900
See what they tell you.

1567
01:51:13,900 --> 01:51:16,520
Would that mean that they're posers?

1568
01:51:16,520 --> 01:51:18,340
By the way, I'm being yelled at in the chatroom.

1569
01:51:18,340 --> 01:51:21,940
This is the worldwide rally, not just the national.

1570
01:51:21,940 --> 01:51:22,940
I forgot Canada.

1571
01:51:22,940 --> 01:51:25,040
Sorry, because I know we have Canadian listeners.

1572
01:51:25,040 --> 01:51:27,180
I forgot.

1573
01:51:27,180 --> 01:51:29,220
You're all really close to the border anyway, right?

1574
01:51:29,220 --> 01:51:33,660
it's a worldwide and I don't do they have ITG machines in Austria I think

1575
01:51:33,660 --> 01:51:37,620
there's like one in Australia one in Europe so it's worldwide so if you're

1576
01:51:37,620 --> 01:51:40,800
crazy if you're in Europe and you're freaking crazy enough to come to the

1577
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:44,660
States and play machines so you can win this contest hey more power to you

1578
01:51:44,660 --> 01:51:51,260
more power to you who cares honestly I don't well I think the whole concept is

1579
01:51:51,260 --> 01:51:54,620
what's need despite how you feel about the game the fact that the company is

1580
01:51:54,620 --> 01:51:59,080
endorsing it is gonna fly people to Las Vegas that's kind of neat to me and they

1581
01:51:59,080 --> 01:52:01,080
They might not be able to when they're broke.

1582
01:52:01,080 --> 01:52:02,080
Stop.

1583
01:52:02,080 --> 01:52:03,080
After the lawsuit.

1584
01:52:03,080 --> 01:52:04,080
Alright.

1585
01:52:04,080 --> 01:52:07,080
I'm going to laugh when that happens.

1586
01:52:07,080 --> 01:52:13,080
I'm the most hardcore, I drove all around the country, I went to all these places.

1587
01:52:13,080 --> 01:52:15,080
Yeah, but we went under.

1588
01:52:15,080 --> 01:52:16,080
Good for you.

1589
01:52:16,080 --> 01:52:17,080
Here's a sticker.

1590
01:52:17,080 --> 01:52:19,480
Didn't that happen with Atari years ago?

1591
01:52:19,480 --> 01:52:23,720
I was reading about like the Sword Quest finals or something and they canceled it before they

1592
01:52:23,720 --> 01:52:24,720
got to the end.

1593
01:52:24,720 --> 01:52:25,720
I don't know.

1594
01:52:25,720 --> 01:52:28,620
something came up on um...

1595
01:52:28,620 --> 01:52:31,020
something came up on uh... slashdot

1596
01:52:31,020 --> 01:52:34,680
like a retro article on the whole thing or something from what I remember

1597
01:52:34,680 --> 01:52:37,140
whatever

1598
01:52:37,140 --> 01:52:41,780
alright kids i think it's about time to get into the orange lounge radio cage

1599
01:52:41,780 --> 01:52:43,420
match

1600
01:52:43,420 --> 01:52:44,840
sound good

1601
01:52:44,840 --> 01:52:47,540
okey-dokey

1602
01:52:47,540 --> 01:52:51,900
the way the cage match works we play three songs for your listening pleasure

1603
01:52:51,900 --> 01:52:55,420
one song selected by each host

1604
01:52:55,420 --> 01:52:59,760
And the winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's

1605
01:52:59,760 --> 01:53:03,260
Bimani Music and More program, which plays 24 hours a day,

1606
01:53:03,260 --> 01:53:07,060
seven days a week on this station, when we are not live.

1607
01:53:07,060 --> 01:53:10,740
You only get to hear a clip of last week's winner, though, because it already won

1608
01:53:10,740 --> 01:53:12,260
last week, so you've already heard it.

1609
01:53:12,260 --> 01:53:15,180
So last week in the Cage match, we had a brand new winner.

1610
01:53:15,180 --> 01:53:19,360
It's a band called The Ozoic, who is actually going to be in UltraMix 3,

1611
01:53:19,360 --> 01:53:22,700
but this is a different song by The Ozoic. It's a song called

1612
01:53:22,700 --> 01:53:26,780
Let Me Tell You Something. Remember, if you want to vote in the cage match, get your butt

1613
01:53:26,780 --> 01:53:32,420
in our chat room, www.orangesomsradio.com. Click on chat. Here it is, song number one

1614
01:53:32,420 --> 01:53:39,420
you can vote for tonight via Zoic with a clip of Let Me Tell You Something.

1615
01:54:02,420 --> 01:54:05,420
You should know that I make time like no one is

1616
01:54:05,420 --> 01:54:08,420
No time for you to go to no time

1617
01:54:08,420 --> 01:54:10,420
Don't you come in and hide

1618
01:54:10,420 --> 01:54:15,420
And you say you can't change my strength away, no way

1619
01:54:15,420 --> 01:54:18,420
There's just so pretty people inside of me

1620
01:54:18,420 --> 01:54:21,420
But now I'm searching all the things you say

1621
01:54:21,420 --> 01:54:24,420
There's just so pretty people in your mind

1622
01:54:24,420 --> 01:54:26,420
Who think that you're thinking

1623
01:54:26,420 --> 01:54:29,420
What's left of me is condescending

1624
01:54:29,420 --> 01:54:42,420
You think you can get to me, let me tell you something, I won't be pushed around, oh

1625
01:54:42,420 --> 01:54:56,420
It's my life, I cannot give up anything You cannot break me down

1626
01:55:12,420 --> 01:55:22,420
Alright, there was a clip of song number one, the Azoic, with Let Me Tell You Something.

1627
01:55:22,420 --> 01:55:25,980
Let Me Tell You Something, that song is going for its second win tonight, so we'll see if

1628
01:55:25,980 --> 01:55:30,940
that'll win or if one of these two new songs will dethrone the Azoic.

1629
01:55:30,940 --> 01:55:33,060
We'll start it off with Loki's pick tonight.

1630
01:55:33,060 --> 01:55:35,340
Loki, what did you choose for our lucky listeners?

1631
01:55:35,340 --> 01:55:38,980
I chose a song called Wraiths because it's awesome.

1632
01:55:38,980 --> 01:55:41,980
And it's also a new MIDI head track, so...

1633
01:55:41,980 --> 01:55:44,980
Oh, okay. Goody goody, here we go.

1634
01:55:44,980 --> 01:55:48,980
Monolithic with Wraith. Of course, I love it.

1635
01:55:48,980 --> 01:55:50,980
Alright, does he sing in it?

1636
01:55:50,980 --> 01:55:51,980
Yes.

1637
01:55:51,980 --> 01:55:54,980
Dark Soccer, get ready for this one. Alright, here we go.

1638
01:55:54,980 --> 01:56:01,980
monolithic with wraith

1639
01:56:24,980 --> 01:56:34,980
I'm standing inside of me, taking my pride from within

1640
01:56:34,980 --> 01:56:40,980
The darkness behind me speaks to me again

1641
01:56:40,980 --> 01:56:45,980
I'm standing, speaking to me

1642
01:56:45,980 --> 01:56:49,980
And if you survive, they'll bow at me

1643
01:56:49,980 --> 01:56:52,980
And I will steal the threat

1644
01:56:52,980 --> 01:56:55,980
Show me what I can turn in

1645
01:56:56,980 --> 01:57:02,980
When what you know is mistaken

1646
01:57:03,980 --> 01:57:10,980
And if we don't fall, then take it by

1647
01:57:10,980 --> 01:57:13,980
You're raised in the dark

1648
01:57:26,980 --> 01:57:30,980
Colliding inside of me

1649
01:57:30,980 --> 01:57:34,980
The rays of an insanity

1650
01:57:34,980 --> 01:57:38,980
It's blinding my soul from the flesh

1651
01:57:38,980 --> 01:57:40,980
So where am I?

1652
01:57:40,980 --> 01:57:42,980
I won't be in the night

1653
01:57:42,980 --> 01:57:44,980
You can't hide the fighting

1654
01:57:44,980 --> 01:57:48,980
You kill the heart that's deep in me

1655
01:57:48,980 --> 01:57:52,980
Raise all that's life in me

1656
01:57:52,980 --> 01:57:55,980
I can't see, I can't, I can't

1657
01:57:55,980 --> 01:58:01,980
With what you know is mistaken

1658
01:58:01,980 --> 01:58:12,980
And if you fall and take it by, you're raised in the dark

1659
01:59:12,980 --> 01:59:29,980
Remember who you are, with what you know is a fake hell

1660
01:59:29,980 --> 01:59:41,980
And if you fall, take it by, you'll raise it in the dark

1661
01:59:41,980 --> 01:59:48,980
You'll raise it in the dark

1662
02:02:18,980 --> 02:02:34,620
Okay, that was song number two, Monolithic with Wraith.

1663
02:02:34,620 --> 02:02:39,700
Let's go around and see if it was good or bad, according to us.

1664
02:02:39,700 --> 02:02:40,700
Dark Sakura.

1665
02:02:40,700 --> 02:02:58,700
It sounds like what I would hear at the goth club I go to, so in that sense it's pretty generic and I still don't really care for his singing. I like the song overall, but it's pretty generic, so I give it about a 7.

1666
02:03:28,700 --> 02:03:32,840
really try to see if he can't do like music scores for video games

1667
02:03:32,840 --> 02:03:36,480
because I think I think if he coupled up with the right gaming company they could do a

1668
02:03:36,480 --> 02:03:38,320
sweet soundtrack for a game

1669
02:03:38,320 --> 02:03:44,280
I'd have to second that. I really do like I don't know why I mean DDR is one thing

1670
02:03:44,280 --> 02:03:45,240
but he really

1671
02:03:45,240 --> 02:03:49,400
like if the rumors are true and he's not into the album making things so much

1672
02:03:49,400 --> 02:03:52,440
anymore he really ought to think about doing the video game scoring because

1673
02:03:52,440 --> 02:03:56,640
I could hear that kind of music in a game like Devil May Cry or something, I don't know

1674
02:03:56,640 --> 02:03:57,640
I just think it would kick out.

1675
02:03:57,640 --> 02:04:02,640
Or even like, he does a lot of good instrumental stuff even just for other things, like media stuff.

1676
02:04:02,640 --> 02:04:04,640
Seriously, gaming companies?

1677
02:04:04,640 --> 02:04:07,640
Look this guy up, bittyhead.com, you should score your game.

1678
02:04:07,640 --> 02:04:13,640
As for the song itself, Stand Alone, it's kind of a little too atmospheric to be a Stand Alone song for me.

1679
02:04:13,640 --> 02:04:17,640
I think it's the type of song I'd enjoy more on the scope of an album.

1680
02:04:17,640 --> 02:04:20,640
So in that sense, if that is the song on the album, I'm looking forward to the album.

1681
02:04:20,640 --> 02:04:22,640
But the song itself, I'm not so hot on.

1682
02:04:22,640 --> 02:04:25,640
So I'll stop talking and give it a seven and a half.

1683
02:04:25,640 --> 02:04:28,380
Angel

1684
02:04:28,380 --> 02:04:30,840
I liked it, it was pretty good.

1685
02:04:30,840 --> 02:04:37,840
Maybe he had always been a plus in my book as far as music talent and stuff, so I'll give it an 8.

1686
02:04:38,860 --> 02:04:46,040
An 8 from Angel. There you have it, but remember it's not our votes that make it important, it's your votes that count in the end, so get your butt in chat.

1687
02:04:46,040 --> 02:04:54,920
One more song to go though, and it comes from DarkSakura. I put the wrong song in, I meant to copy what I put in there to a different folder, and ended up copying the wrong song.

1688
02:04:54,920 --> 02:04:59,920
But hey, it's a good song. I like that it makes fun of clubs, yet it's played at clubs everywhere.

1689
02:04:59,920 --> 02:05:02,920
So it's Blur, Girls and Boys.

1690
02:05:02,920 --> 02:05:07,920
A little bit of Blur! Alright, I like Blur. Let's check this out. Blur with girls and boys. We'll be back after this.

1691
02:05:32,920 --> 02:05:52,920
Street's like a jungle, the call of police Following the herd, down to Great

1692
02:05:52,920 --> 02:06:02,920
On holiday, we love in the 90's It's paranoid

1693
02:06:02,920 --> 02:06:11,920
On funny pictures, take your chances

1694
02:06:11,920 --> 02:06:14,920
Don't give up, girls, we want boys, we want boys

1695
02:06:14,920 --> 02:06:19,920
Two girls, two boys, we want girls Two girls, we want boys

1696
02:06:19,920 --> 02:06:27,920
Always should be someone you really love

1697
02:06:27,920 --> 02:06:31,920
Avoiding a word

1698
02:06:31,920 --> 02:06:35,920
She says I'm available

1699
02:06:35,920 --> 02:06:39,920
Like matter is in cut

1700
02:06:39,920 --> 02:06:41,920
Candle falls

1701
02:06:41,920 --> 02:06:43,920
I'm one, two, three, four

1702
02:06:43,920 --> 02:06:47,920
I think that nothing is wasted

1703
02:06:47,920 --> 02:06:51,920
Only we produce

1704
02:06:51,920 --> 02:06:55,920
You cannot inflict us

1705
02:06:55,920 --> 02:06:57,920
You've been special

1706
02:06:57,920 --> 02:07:00,920
But we haven't been introduced

1707
02:07:00,920 --> 02:07:02,920
Girls who are boys who are boys

1708
02:07:02,920 --> 02:07:05,920
Girls who are boys are their girls

1709
02:07:05,920 --> 02:07:07,920
Girls who are their boys

1710
02:07:07,920 --> 02:07:15,920
Always should be someone you really love

1711
02:07:15,920 --> 02:07:24,920
Girls love boys, love boys, big girls, boys love big girls, girls love big boys

1712
02:07:24,920 --> 02:07:32,920
I should be someone to really love

1713
02:07:47,920 --> 02:07:50,920
Looking for girls who are boys, who like boys

1714
02:07:50,920 --> 02:07:56,920
You like boys, who be girls, who do boys, like they're girls, who do girls, like they're boys

1715
02:07:56,920 --> 02:08:03,920
Oh, I should be someone you really love

1716
02:08:03,920 --> 02:08:09,920
Girls who are boys, you like boys, who be girls, who do boys,

1717
02:08:09,920 --> 02:08:13,420
Like they're girls, you do girls, like they're boys

1718
02:08:13,420 --> 02:08:19,920
Oh, I should be someone you really love

1719
02:09:19,920 --> 02:09:32,920
SONG number three in tonight's cage match, Blurr with Girls and Boys, Dark Sakura. What'd you think of that one?

1720
02:09:32,920 --> 02:09:33,920
Ten. It's Blurr.

1721
02:09:33,920 --> 02:09:35,920
How did I guess?

1722
02:09:35,920 --> 02:09:36,920
Uh, Loki.

1723
02:09:36,920 --> 02:09:39,920
Ah! Little steppy.

1724
02:09:39,920 --> 02:09:48,920
I like the remix of the song a lot. The remix of the song, if you've attended that, it felt like something was missing.

1725
02:09:48,920 --> 02:09:51,920
Well, that's the original.

1726
02:09:51,920 --> 02:09:55,920
How can something be missing from the original?

1727
02:09:55,920 --> 02:10:01,920
The remix! That's what's missing from it, because it sucked. The remix made it better, so it gets a six.

1728
02:10:01,920 --> 02:10:03,920
I don't know who you are anymore.

1729
02:10:03,920 --> 02:10:06,920
I want song two better!

1730
02:10:06,920 --> 02:10:09,320
All right, where's song two is awesome

1731
02:10:09,320 --> 02:10:14,280
Um, I would you know, I give this song itself a 10 because I love that song

1732
02:10:14,280 --> 02:10:16,240
But I don't know it's a cage match pick

1733
02:10:16,240 --> 02:10:19,440
I kind of like it when like songs I haven't heard but I know it was a mistake

1734
02:10:19,600 --> 02:10:22,860
So as a song I give it a 10 that it's a cage match pick. I give it an 8

1735
02:10:23,440 --> 02:10:25,440
sir angel

1736
02:10:25,760 --> 02:10:27,760
It's blur is good

1737
02:10:29,600 --> 02:10:35,320
May God thank God I didn't get done what I wanted to do. Mm-hmm. I have a remix

1738
02:10:35,320 --> 02:10:40,420
I thought about doing that I'm looking at doing that you're gonna be like when when you hear you be like

1739
02:10:40,860 --> 02:10:45,680
What is it? Oh, you know what Jamie's not in the room right now. Is it a gorillas mix or something? Is that?

1740
02:10:46,780 --> 02:10:48,780
No, okay. I imagine

1741
02:10:49,340 --> 02:10:51,220
it's

1742
02:10:51,220 --> 02:10:56,220
Just just it's in a John Travolta movie. Oh boy. All right. All right. We'll see

1743
02:10:56,700 --> 02:11:00,360
Is it like the Black Eyed Peas doing misery Lou or something? No, okay

1744
02:11:00,360 --> 02:11:03,840
Alright, let's recap the three songs you can vote for tonight.

1745

1752
02:11:49,720 --> 02:11:50,720
Loki!

1753
02:11:50,720 --> 02:11:54,700
This is always a part of the show where I ask you what's going on in the sim scene if anything

1754
02:11:57,320 --> 02:12:00,920
Nothing well there was only one thing they were doing some new well

1755
02:12:00,920 --> 02:12:05,040
They're a couple things actually I should mention, but myself doing other remix contest

1756
02:12:06,160 --> 02:12:13,160
And in the thing now, it's no mash mixes unless they're very good, and that's that was their specific

1757
02:12:13,160 --> 02:12:19,260
specific instructions there. I see. And then also... Hey, I have a great Max 300 mix I

1758
02:12:19,260 --> 02:12:20,260
want to submit.

1759
02:12:20,260 --> 02:12:29,600
Do you think I could win the Bimani style contest with this? I don't know, you know,

1760
02:12:29,600 --> 02:12:35,720
something like that should be in a dancing game, like in the groove. Couldn't resist.

1761
02:12:35,720 --> 02:12:42,160
That is so awful. It's like, come on. They didn't even try to make it sound different.

1762
02:12:42,160 --> 02:12:47,480
I mean, it's... And then what the hell was the middle part there that had, like, nothing

1763
02:12:47,480 --> 02:12:51,360
to do with the whole song? Because, you know, putting piano stuff in, like, a techno song,

1764
02:12:51,360 --> 02:12:53,000
that's the hip thing to do.

1765
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:56,880
Look, look. You bashed on the game enough tonight. You've met your quota. Go back to

1766
02:12:56,880 --> 02:12:57,880
The Sims.

1767
02:12:57,880 --> 02:13:02,340
Fine, anyways. Nothing going on in The Sims scene, really. We're still waiting for the

1768
02:13:02,340 --> 02:13:05,380
food mix two stuff to come out that's what I'm waiting for hopefully by the

1769
02:13:05,380 --> 02:13:09,940
end of summer because we need another food mix release and really they meant

1770
02:13:09,940 --> 02:13:15,140
that's all that's kind of going on a side note that's kind of interesting

1771
02:13:15,140 --> 02:13:20,100
MIDI head who we've just heard a track from is going to be doing a podcast

1772
02:13:20,100 --> 02:13:25,020
coming soon I believe the date is the 27th of July and it's going to feature

1773
02:13:25,020 --> 02:13:31,380
all of his remix songs that he's done for dance dance revolution including the

1774
02:13:31,380 --> 02:13:38,300
stuff that's going to be in Ultramix 3. So check that out. And if you don't check it

1775
02:13:38,300 --> 02:13:40,900
out there, we will be replaying it on the show.

1776
02:13:40,900 --> 02:13:46,020
Oh, will we now? All right, no, I wonder not. The songs, I definitely want to play that

1777
02:13:46,020 --> 02:13:47,020
show with this mix.

1778
02:13:47,020 --> 02:13:50,420
But yeah, he's hoping that they, that Konami gets behind this and like starts promoting

1779
02:13:50,420 --> 02:13:56,740
his podcast on iTunes and that type of thing. You know, get the whole company thing going.

1780
02:13:56,740 --> 02:14:17,740
Anyways, I'm still looking to remix some more songs. I've thought about a few things, and the next one I want to do is really strange. It's totally different. I don't even know if it's going to get off the ground. It's not a Bomani track at all. And I already told Rob what it was.

1781
02:14:17,740 --> 02:14:24,740
I only half heard it, though. If it is what I thought you said, then yeah, very interesting.

1782
02:14:24,740 --> 02:14:35,740
I don't know, when I heard the song again, when I was sitting in Mel's, it just sounded to me like, this could be a club track, it could be. Someone should have done a remix of this.

1783
02:14:35,740 --> 02:14:46,740
But it's very strange, and I don't know if I can do it justice or even do a remix of it, so that's why I'm kind of keeping it under wraps for now.

1784
02:14:46,740 --> 02:14:51,740
Okay. Should be interesting. Hey, tell me about this DM Ashura thing you were talking to me about earlier.

1785
02:14:51,740 --> 02:15:08,740
Oh, yeah. DM Ashore is doing songs now for O2Jam, and yeah, they're still around. His new song for O2Jam is going to be Go, and they have a little preview. You can actually, there's a thread on Mysyle in their music production forum about it.

1786
02:15:08,740 --> 02:15:14,500
So go check it out. Sounds sort of like techno with, you know, a bit of like the Japanese

1787
02:15:14,500 --> 02:15:19,060
tribal stuff in there, you know, just kind of, you know, sort of like Japan or exotic

1788
02:15:19,060 --> 02:15:24,260
ethnic type stuff. But it's really good. So definitely check it out. The only problem

1789
02:15:24,260 --> 02:15:31,460
is it's a recording of someone playing it so it's not, you know, completely in sync

1790
02:15:31,460 --> 02:15:37,940
but it's good enough. You get an idea. All right. But yeah, so that's kind of cool.

1791
02:15:37,940 --> 02:15:42,620
How many Max remixes put out this week? You know, I haven't been downloading

1792
02:15:42,620 --> 02:15:43,700
remixes on

1793
02:15:43,700 --> 02:15:47,220
Bomani style, but you know, since we've got

1794
02:15:47,220 --> 02:15:51,660
you know, a second here, let's... Actually I found this sim file and it had a real sweet Max

1795
02:15:51,660 --> 02:15:52,860
remix in it. Wanna hear it?

1796
02:15:52,860 --> 02:15:59,860
Couldn't resist, sorry.

1797
02:15:59,860 --> 02:16:03,340
This is so

1798
02:16:03,340 --> 02:16:06,700
wrong. So, so wrong. But anyways, um,

1799
02:16:06,700 --> 02:16:12,540
let's see this week's uh... max remix uh... quota here

02:16:19,220 --> 02:16:22,380
oh it's like a telethon waiting for the big results

1803
02:16:22,380 --> 02:16:26,420
uh... well let's see there wasn't too much this week uh...

1804
02:16:26,420 --> 02:16:28,940
starting with uh...

1805
02:16:28,940 --> 02:16:31,240
we have the legend of max

1806
02:16:31,240 --> 02:16:32,920
uh... three hundred bpm

1807
02:16:32,920 --> 02:16:41,920
Paranoia Climax Japan Mix, The Legend of Max Tribute and Max Attack, all of which are re-released.

1808
02:16:41,920 --> 02:16:47,920
However, though, in June, there was quite a bit on the week beforehand. We had Maximizer,

1809
02:16:47,920 --> 02:16:54,920
Max Naruku Jr., Max Beats, The Legend of Max Part 1, Paranoia Max Dirty Mix, Legend of

02:17:18,180 --> 02:17:24,260
mean it you wouldn't hear it all right let's um let's hear tonight's cage match

1814
02:17:24,260 --> 02:17:31,260
Are you kids ready for this? I guess. Tonight's cage match winner is... a tie.

1815
02:17:31,260 --> 02:17:35,260
So you know how the ties work. Somebody's going to be breaking the tie. Let's find out who's breaking the tie.

1816
02:17:35,260 --> 02:17:40,260
Song number one that is a tied song tonight is...

1817
02:17:40,260 --> 02:17:42,260
Girls and Boys.

1818
02:17:42,260 --> 02:17:44,260
People have taste.

1819
02:17:44,260 --> 02:17:48,260
And song number two that is a tie tonight is...

1820
02:17:48,260 --> 02:17:55,380
Yes, Zoick was letting me tell you something, so let me tell you something.

1821
02:17:55,380 --> 02:17:59,180
This means Loki's got to break the tie, because his song didn't win.

1822
02:17:59,180 --> 02:18:01,020
So what do you think, Loki?

1823
02:18:01,020 --> 02:18:02,020
Holick?

1824
02:18:02,020 --> 02:18:03,020
No.

1825
02:18:03,020 --> 02:18:06,340
Um, which song do I dislike the most?

1826
02:18:06,340 --> 02:18:13,220
I don't know, Zoick is just kind of, eh, no, I'm going to have to give it to Blur.

1827
02:18:13,220 --> 02:18:14,220
Woohoo!

1828
02:18:14,220 --> 02:18:16,100
You've redeemed yourself tonight, thank you.

1829
02:18:16,100 --> 02:18:17,100
Whatever.

1830
02:18:17,100 --> 02:18:21,800
that to redeem yourself with jamie

1831
02:18:21,800 --> 02:18:28,800
you realize this is technically the the fourth song with damon singing this one

1832
02:18:30,600 --> 02:18:33,020
wow

1833
02:18:33,020 --> 02:18:35,140
all right there it is

1834
02:18:35,140 --> 02:18:36,340
and you know what's sad

1835
02:18:36,340 --> 02:18:38,680
i'd just got another vote

1836
02:18:38,680 --> 02:18:41,220
and it would have broken the tie the other way

1837
02:18:41,220 --> 02:18:44,360
too late you gotta get your votes in on time

1838
02:18:44,360 --> 02:18:57,020
So then we have MaxToTheMax, HeadToToes280MaxSurvivor, and MaxSinsanity with Link.

1839
02:18:57,020 --> 02:18:58,020
I think we're going to go to a break.

1840
02:18:58,020 --> 02:19:02,540
When we come back from this break, of course the FUs of the week because we are angsty

1841
02:19:02,540 --> 02:19:06,460
individuals and we are going to spread that angst throughout the world.

1842
02:19:06,460 --> 02:19:08,980
And also when we come back, some Ask Orange Lounge if we have a little time.

1843
02:19:08,980 --> 02:19:13,020
And you know what, while you're waiting for us to come back, you can also download such

1844
02:19:13,020 --> 02:19:17,020
Simphiles as Max Tampon.

1845
02:19:17,020 --> 02:19:21,020
That's lovely. That's very lovely.

1846
02:19:21,020 --> 02:19:25,020
I think we need some Eurobeat in the house, so

1847
02:19:25,020 --> 02:19:29,020
we're going to do some Eurobeat. You want to hear Velfire?

1848
02:19:29,020 --> 02:19:33,020
I'd like to hear Velfire, thank you. Here it is, just for you

1849
02:19:33,020 --> 02:19:37,020
DarkSakura. We'll be back after this.

1850
02:20:07,020 --> 02:20:09,020
Come on!

1851
02:20:21,020 --> 02:20:22,520
Hurry up, my little guy

1852
02:20:22,520 --> 02:20:25,520
Everyone is getting all the secrets, baby

1853
02:20:27,020 --> 02:20:28,520
Come on, baby, come on, boy

1854
02:20:28,520 --> 02:20:30,520
Won't you really be the only one?

1855
02:20:30,520 --> 02:20:31,520
It's Tokyo

1856
02:20:33,020 --> 02:20:34,520
Now, bye, now, bye

1857
02:20:34,520 --> 02:20:37,660
Flicking together with the dancing dancing

1858
02:20:37,660 --> 02:20:39,020
You gotta move your moving

1859
02:20:39,020 --> 02:20:40,680
Ba-ba, ba-ba

1860
02:20:40,680 --> 02:20:43,160
Jumping together in the Eurobeat

1861
02:20:43,160 --> 02:20:45,300
Ba come on and dance tonight

1862
02:20:45,300 --> 02:20:48,200
Ba-ba into the music countdown

1863
02:20:48,200 --> 02:20:51,260
Ba-ba into the new century

1864
02:20:51,260 --> 02:20:53,780
Ba-ba into the future coming

1865
02:20:53,780 --> 02:20:55,300
Here on there

1866
02:20:55,300 --> 02:20:57,180
Ba-ba 2000

1867
02:20:57,180 --> 02:21:00,040
Ba-ba into the music countdown

1868
02:21:00,040 --> 02:21:03,240
Ba-ba into the new century

1869
02:21:03,240 --> 02:21:05,740
The vampire distribution is coming

1870
02:21:05,740 --> 02:21:07,240
You're on fire

1871
02:21:07,240 --> 02:21:09,240
And back from 2000, come down

1872
02:21:09,240 --> 02:21:11,240
Please don't smile

1873
02:22:09,240 --> 02:22:11,240
Oh

1874
02:24:09,240 --> 02:24:13,240
It's the seed of my heart, what you're feeling is mine

1875
02:24:13,240 --> 02:24:16,240
And it feels you better stay behind

1876
02:24:16,240 --> 02:24:19,240
It's the desiccant soul that you try to relieve

1877
02:24:19,240 --> 02:24:22,240
You'll never understand, your heart can't function

1878
02:24:22,240 --> 02:24:24,240
Feel it, feel it, baby

1879
02:24:24,240 --> 02:24:28,240
Feel the fire, it's burning deep inside me

1880
02:24:28,240 --> 02:24:30,240
Listen, listen, honey

1881
02:24:30,240 --> 02:24:33,240
Listen to the music to you

1882
02:24:33,240 --> 02:24:35,240
Listen to the heartbeat

1883
02:25:05,240 --> 02:25:23,600
I'm not on my own I'm not on my own

1884
02:25:23,600 --> 02:25:44,600
Welcome to the broken road, welcome to the painless deep of night

1885
02:25:44,600 --> 02:25:50,600
Come on lady come and go, come on lady tell me what to write

1886
02:25:50,600 --> 02:25:51,340
Right

1887
02:25:53,740 --> 02:25:56,380
Not the danger, not the bet you're seeing

1888
02:25:56,380 --> 02:25:59,420
Yeah, rock it, rock it, rock it, make it a throw

1889
02:25:59,420 --> 02:26:02,540
I'll also name my name, I'll make it if you know

1890
02:26:02,540 --> 02:26:05,900
I'll fly to the east, looking for me

1891
02:26:05,900 --> 02:26:09,300
Yeah, night's on fire, you better, better stay

1892
02:26:09,300 --> 02:26:12,260
You better, better be in the race to play

1893
02:26:12,260 --> 02:26:15,420
Night's on fire, you better, better be

1894
02:26:15,420 --> 02:26:18,140
You better, better stop, you'll never be

1895
02:26:18,140 --> 02:26:20,140
You're a nightfall fighter

1896
02:26:20,140 --> 02:26:22,140
You've got a lot of things

1897
02:26:22,140 --> 02:26:24,140
You've got a battle to kill and pray and to slay

1898
02:26:24,140 --> 02:26:26,140
Nightfall fighter

1899
02:26:26,140 --> 02:26:28,140
Come over for the beat

1900
02:26:28,140 --> 02:26:30,140
Come over, over the set

1901
02:26:30,140 --> 02:26:32,140
You're a nightfall fighter

1902
02:26:32,140 --> 02:26:43,860
Enjoy!

1903
02:26:43,860 --> 02:27:02,020
So, orchestral music playing...

1904
02:27:02,020 --> 02:27:06,020
What ever happened to Step Squad? Are they still doing stuff?

1905
02:27:06,020 --> 02:27:10,020
We're supposed to be going to dinner sometime this month.

1906
02:27:10,020 --> 02:27:14,020
Oh, that's nice. That's nice. Good bunch of kids, that Step Squad.

1907
02:27:14,020 --> 02:27:17,020
With the exception of this one girl. Dark, sorry.

1908
02:27:17,020 --> 02:27:18,020
Okay, thank you!

1909
02:27:18,020 --> 02:27:20,020
I'm just kidding.

1910
02:27:20,020 --> 02:27:25,020
In that break, you heard Velfaya 2000, Pandora, which is kind of Eurobeat.

1911
02:27:25,020 --> 02:27:30,020
Natalie, or Nathalie actually, from 2DX7 style also, Initial D.

1912
02:27:30,020 --> 02:27:34,820
We that song got played to death because it was the default song in the first mix of initial D heartbeat and

1913
02:27:35,780 --> 02:27:38,660
But no, no, I'm kidding. No spaceboy was they sorry

1914
02:27:38,660 --> 02:27:43,100
I'm sorry, but heartbeat was in it and they got played to death because we're all beat many people too

1915
02:27:43,100 --> 02:27:45,560
And then Nico not a night of fire, which by the way

1916
02:27:45,560 --> 02:27:49,480
We are such dorks because we were actually doing the para dancing. Although I couldn't remember it all it's hard

1917
02:27:49,480 --> 02:27:51,840
I remembered it cuz I'm a bigger nerd than you are

1918
02:27:51,840 --> 02:27:55,720
It's hard without the high-heeled girl doing it helping you out and doing it for you

1919
02:27:55,720 --> 02:27:59,800
You know, I kind of wish I feel really gay for saying this, but that's okay

1920
02:27:59,800 --> 02:28:03,460
I kind of wish Para Para would make a comeback like in the u.s. I know

1921
02:28:04,300 --> 02:28:10,700
They tried to open a part of our club in LA did they really I think it's sort of in there pioneers releasing the Para Para

1922
02:28:10,700 --> 02:28:16,320
Para Para CDs here. They need they need to have a Para Para. I've been buying the anime Para Para CDs

1923
02:28:16,320 --> 02:28:19,840
They should have a Para Para TV show on a ZN television. Have you seen this?

1924
02:28:20,100 --> 02:28:26,460
There's a I get a ZN TV now a rebranded international channel is a Z and now you have a reason to watch TV the

1925
02:28:26,460 --> 02:28:29,460
You know what? No, because I caught Fushigi Yugi dubbed.

1926
02:28:29,460 --> 02:28:37,460
I'm sorry, I wanted to pour bleach into my head, shake it around, pour it back out, and then follow it up with, like, witch hazels or something.

1927
02:28:37,460 --> 02:28:43,460
I saw some pretty funny sitcom on there the other day. It was some Filipino sitcom, I think it was. It was cute. I liked it.

1928
02:28:43,460 --> 02:29:00,460
Alright, moving right along, we're going to get into the angsty angsty FUs of the week, but you should send in your FUs as well, because I know you guys probably have some angst, but this is the part of the show where you can release that angst. We encourage you to.

1929
02:29:00,460 --> 02:29:06,820
Alright, so that being said, DarkSakura, why is it that we have to do these FUs every single

1930
02:29:06,820 --> 02:29:07,820
week?

1931
02:29:07,820 --> 02:29:08,820
Uh...

1932
02:29:08,820 --> 02:29:28,580
Big FU goes to the fucking hurricane, because, you know, I was all really, really worried

1933
02:29:28,580 --> 02:29:36,220
about my family, and it was just a bunch of crap. I was getting all sick, and, you know,

1934
02:29:36,220 --> 02:29:43,140
and then the hurricane, like, hit Sarasota. So it was like, I'm glad it didn't hit Mobile.

1935
02:29:43,140 --> 02:29:49,780
It's sort of, I feel let down, in a really, you know, messed up way, but at least, you

1936
02:29:49,780 --> 02:29:53,540
know, I'm glad my family and all my friends out in the area are doing okay, and I'm sorry

1937
02:29:53,540 --> 02:30:04,780
for poor poor Sarasota. Another F.U. goes to my digestive system for, I guess, not working

1938
02:30:04,780 --> 02:30:15,120
anymore. Because I've been going through, digestion hurts worse than being hungry right

1939
02:30:15,120 --> 02:30:22,360
now. And that's a horrible state just for someone to find oneself in. So I don't think

1940
02:30:22,360 --> 02:30:28,880
I'm gonna like eat for a week and see if that helps cuz I was starting to feel better before

1941
02:30:28,880 --> 02:30:34,420
I came here and actually felt a little hungry so I ate a handful of Brazil nuts and then

1942
02:30:34,420 --> 02:30:49,420
drank a liter of water and guess what? I feel sick. Fun huh? An SU goes to buses, not buses,

1943
02:30:49,420 --> 02:30:56,420
Like 18-wheelers who drive on the left lane on a two-lane street, especially the winding

1944
02:30:57,180 --> 02:31:04,180
mountain road going Torino. Yeah. Y'all can, you know, drive off into a ravine or something.

1945
02:31:06,420 --> 02:31:10,980
Another F.U. goes to 18-wheelers that try to pass other 18-wheelers. It's just sort

1946
02:31:10,980 --> 02:31:17,980
of pointless because they can't really go all that fast anyway. And that's really it.

1947
02:31:17,980 --> 02:31:27,980
Fuck you to my mouse for the left mouse button to stop working. It doesn't want to click no more.

1948
02:31:27,980 --> 02:31:34,220
I've clicked it way too many times and now it just it's practically works the other mouse buttons worked fine

1949
02:31:34,220 --> 02:31:36,220
So I had to buy a new mouse yesterday

1950
02:31:36,460 --> 02:31:40,420
Which put me at Best Buy and then I had to get in a stupid person line

1951
02:31:40,420 --> 02:31:43,500
And you know how that goes where for some reason?

1952
02:31:43,500 --> 02:31:46,340
I don't know this person for me is buying like a ton of shit or something because

1953
02:31:46,580 --> 02:31:51,140
Their receipt was about like, you know, it took the printer five times to print it out or something

1954
02:31:51,300 --> 02:31:55,280
You know have the feet the paper through five times. It's just like nuts anyways

1955
02:31:55,280 --> 02:32:14,280
Um, fuck either of that, and fuck either of the fact that there's no food in my house right now, at least nothing that I feel like eating, because it's all leftovers, and I have like this big thing I combined, um, some steak with the minestrone, and so it's this weird mistakey, and um, yeah, that's not very good.

1956
02:32:14,280 --> 02:32:37,280
And then, my work. Um, it's okay. But, um, I don't know. I've just, like, been kind of feeling drained lately. I've been trying to stay up to, like, really late on the weekends, but I've been unable to do that for some reason. Just feeling really drained, and that sucks. And fuck you to the stupid drivers, because they're always in my way.

1957
02:32:37,280 --> 02:32:41,280
And, um, uh...

1958
02:32:41,280 --> 02:32:44,280
In the Groove Sucks!

1959
02:32:44,280 --> 02:32:46,280
Are you done?

1960
02:32:46,280 --> 02:32:49,280
Um, and, um, you know those Macs?

1961
02:32:49,280 --> 02:32:51,280
My toaster has better processing power than them.

1962
02:32:51,280 --> 02:32:53,280
You're done.

1963
02:32:57,280 --> 02:33:01,280
Um, I would like to give an FU to the assholes who broke into my car for the second time.

1964
02:33:01,280 --> 02:33:06,280
And that's another $100 deductible that I won't be seeing anytime soon, so you can fight me.

1965
02:33:06,280 --> 02:33:12,280
I'd also like to give a nephew distress because I was so stressed out on Friday like I got

1966
02:33:12,280 --> 02:33:17,420
I got this work thing like dropped on me literally at the last minute and on a normal day that

1967
02:33:17,420 --> 02:33:20,880
would have been okay but I was dealing with other stresses that day as well and I just

1968
02:33:20,880 --> 02:33:24,240
wanted to die on Friday like seriously like I was so stressed this doesn't happen to be

1969
02:33:24,240 --> 02:33:29,320
very often but I was stressed where like I could taste vomit like I'm gonna barf I swear

1970
02:33:29,320 --> 02:33:33,220
I'm gonna barf although I didn't barf but I really wanted to and that sucks to go around

1971
02:33:33,220 --> 02:33:37,500
all day going, I'm gonna barf, no I'm not. That's how I felt, right? So, F you to barfing.

1972
02:33:37,500 --> 02:33:44,500
Cause that's no fun, nobody likes that. Except Loki, when he's drunk. What, Loki? I said

1973
02:33:44,500 --> 02:33:48,460
funny, that's what I felt like on Sunday. Very funny, except you did barf. I don't know

1974
02:33:48,460 --> 02:33:54,820
if you remember. I remember a few of them. We all remember. He sat there on the carpet.

1975
02:33:54,820 --> 02:33:58,800
I don't even remember falling on the floor, though. You didn't fall, you were just sitting

1976
02:33:58,800 --> 02:34:07,920
there and he leaned over and out came all the contents of anastronian alcohol. I sort

1977
02:34:07,920 --> 02:34:13,920
of averted my eyes politely.

1978
02:34:13,920 --> 02:34:19,560
Alright, that's it for my FUs by the way. So let's go on to DDR Angel.

1979
02:34:19,560 --> 02:34:26,300
Actually it's more of an honest FU as far as, you know, the shit that happened in London.

1980
02:34:26,300 --> 02:34:28,440
Fuck that. Don't mess with people's lives.

1981
02:34:28,440 --> 02:34:32,440
Hey, I doubly, doubly add to that.

1982
02:34:32,440 --> 02:34:38,440
Okay, because I spent all day, even though, like, their, uh, what?

1983
02:34:38,440 --> 02:34:41,440
Our early morning is their lunch time or whatever.

1984
02:34:41,440 --> 02:34:44,440
Even though I heard about it, something like that.

1985
02:34:44,440 --> 02:34:47,440
Anyway, like, you know, I heard about it at 3 o'clock in the morning,

1986
02:34:47,440 --> 02:34:51,440
and the first thing I thought of was, you know, like, Liam and all those people over there,

1987
02:34:51,440 --> 02:34:54,440
and I was just worried about it, and I'm glad that he's okay,

1988
02:34:54,440 --> 02:34:57,440
and I'm glad that the rest of my friends in the UK are okay and they're alive.

1989
02:34:57,440 --> 02:35:02,140
I got I got a text message for my sister in the morning about it cuz she's she

1990
02:35:02,140 --> 02:35:04,940
visited London an awful lot cuz her ex-husband's from there and while I

1991
02:35:04,940 --> 02:35:09,320
personally don't know anybody except for some of our listeners that are over in

1992
02:35:09,320 --> 02:35:16,140
that area it's just a horrible thing it's a horrible thing doesn't that what

1993
02:35:16,140 --> 02:35:19,860
else can I say what else can be said you know it's a horrible thing that shouldn't

1994
02:35:19,860 --> 02:35:25,620
exist in this world exactly some people that I know are saying like you know we

1995
02:35:25,620 --> 02:35:28,800
we should get used to it or whatever because that's what the world is coming to now and

1996
02:35:28,800 --> 02:35:29,800
it's just like no.

1997
02:35:29,800 --> 02:35:30,800
No, no, no.

1998
02:35:30,800 --> 02:35:31,800
No.

1999
02:35:31,800 --> 02:35:35,960
The whole point is for all of us to stick together and, you know, pretty much reward

2000
02:35:35,960 --> 02:35:39,440
the mob saying, hey, no matter how much you hurt us, we're still going to stick together.

2001
02:35:39,440 --> 02:35:43,840
Yeah, at the same time, I refuse to be terrorized by terrorists.

2002
02:35:43,840 --> 02:35:49,240
So I will be continuing to do my function in this world, which is not only my day job,

2003
02:35:49,240 --> 02:35:53,960
but to spread shit about people I don't like all over the internet.

2004
02:35:53,960 --> 02:36:00,960
So you know what? Fuck you guys, we're gonna catch you and that's it. You're done.

2005
02:36:00,960 --> 02:36:06,960
And we're gonna go on with our lives and do what we do on a day-to-day basis.

2006
02:36:06,960 --> 02:36:09,960
And that's it, I'm done.

2007
02:36:09,960 --> 02:36:11,960
Alright. Let's get to chatroom FUs.

2008
02:36:11,960 --> 02:36:38,320
42 would like to say F you to the fascist douche bags that run our country and the parents

2009
02:36:38,320 --> 02:36:42,400
who go crying to them every time little Timmy shoots up his physics class because he played

2010
02:36:42,400 --> 02:36:46,240
Mortal Kombat when he was 12.

2011
02:36:46,240 --> 02:36:52,080
Sakurina says, F you to EA for having some bastard registration system on their PS2 online

2012
02:36:52,080 --> 02:36:59,240
system that has every name chosen except for stupid names like Pandora, Pandora Noria 2DX,

02:37:33,800 --> 02:37:35,800
Right now, I'm still listening to heartbeat.

2023
02:37:35,800 --> 02:37:36,800
Sad face.

2024
02:37:36,800 --> 02:37:39,200
Aw.

2025
02:37:39,200 --> 02:37:44,000
Dirty Thief says, F you to Taco Bell for making me fat.

2026
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:44,680
You know what?

2027

You have the choice to either or not.

02:37:47,960 --> 02:37:50,840
And MPQ says, F you to Las Vegas.

2029

Thanks for telling me that if you're not 21

2030
02:37:52,960 --> 02:37:54,920
and you can't spend hundreds of dollars an hour,

2031
02:37:54,920 --> 02:37:56,400
you might as well be five.

2032
02:37:56,400 --> 02:37:57,080
Thanks, Vegas.

2033
02:37:57,080 --> 02:37:58,760
Thanks for being 90 degrees at night.

2034
02:37:58,760 --> 02:38:01,480
Thanks for making it a chore just to go outside.

2035
02:38:01,480 --> 02:38:03,280
F you to driving in Oregon.

2036
02:38:03,280 --> 02:38:08,800
Attention Oregon your speed limits are too low. Also, you can't pump your own gas there. I agree

2037
02:38:08,880 --> 02:38:12,620
What the fuck are people too stupid to put the hose in the tank there or something?

2038
02:38:13,040 --> 02:38:19,380
Eff you to driving through the middle of nowhere. I hope I never see another next exit 10 miles or no services sign again. I

2039
02:38:20,360 --> 02:38:22,360
Agree, what's up with that?

2040
02:38:22,360 --> 02:38:26,280
We're not a pump your own gas. That's what we do. That was the last if you anyway

2041
02:38:26,840 --> 02:38:29,720
It's the same thing in New Jersey

2042
02:38:29,720 --> 02:38:33,880
think it is where you can't pump your own gas and somebody told me it's to

2043
02:38:33,880 --> 02:38:46,160
create jobs okay all right uh moving right along we're gonna get into some

2044
02:38:46,160 --> 02:38:49,560

2047
02:38:59,480 --> 02:39:05,480
Can I just give a reminder to folks out there that right now Red Octane is putting together that game Guitar Hero?

2048
02:39:05,480 --> 02:39:17,480
Well, they want your contributions. If you happen to be in a rock band, you could be alongside songs made famous by David Bowie, Red Hot Chili Peppers, White Zombies, The Ramones, Hendrix.

2049
02:39:17,480 --> 02:39:19,480
Hey, we should form a band.

2050
02:39:19,480 --> 02:39:20,480
Seriously, we should form a band.

2051
02:39:20,480 --> 02:39:22,480
And be really awful.

2052
02:39:22,480 --> 02:39:23,480
Sense of music.

2053
02:39:23,480 --> 02:39:26,480
I can't play anything but saxophone and clarinet.

2054
02:39:26,480 --> 02:39:37,600
we could remix Max 300 and send it in. No. No. No. Although I'm thinking about taking

2055
02:39:37,600 --> 02:39:42,560
guitar lessons next semester. That's cool. I used to be able to play keyboards. Loki,

2056
02:39:42,560 --> 02:39:49,680
you want to be our singer? No. Come on. People love your singing. You could just scream angrily.

2057
02:39:49,680 --> 02:39:51,680
It would be awesome.

2058
02:39:51,680 --> 02:39:53,680
I'm staying in.

2059
02:39:53,680 --> 02:39:55,680
Come on, you know you want to.

2060
02:39:55,680 --> 02:39:57,680
No!

2061
02:39:57,680 --> 02:39:59,680
Oh, it would be awesome.

2062
02:39:59,680 --> 02:40:01,680
Wimp!

2063
02:40:01,680 --> 02:40:03,680
I'll be the triangle player.

2064
02:40:03,680 --> 02:40:05,680
I'll give you some maracas.

2065
02:40:05,680 --> 02:40:07,680
You can play the gong.

2066
02:40:07,680 --> 02:40:09,680
There'll be the samba de amigo maracas.

2067
02:40:09,680 --> 02:40:11,680
We'll just wheel out the giant gong and then at the end Loki just

2068
02:40:11,680 --> 02:40:13,680
Bong!

2069
02:40:13,680 --> 02:40:15,680
That would be hideous.

2070
02:40:15,680 --> 02:40:17,680
Animal!

2071
02:40:17,680 --> 02:40:23,760
for you is like a truck bazaar car. You know what, Loki should... Loki's gonna have to

2072
02:40:23,760 --> 02:40:27,360
learn how to play drums. That's what it is. Loki, you learn how to play drums. Dude, all

2073
02:40:27,360 --> 02:40:33,760
the greats have played drums, like Don Henley. We'll bribe... we'll bribe... we'll bribe

2074
02:40:33,760 --> 02:40:42,760
Iguana Girl to be our singer. Okay. Alright. Anyway, if you want to... Our band would be

2075
02:40:42,760 --> 02:40:47,080
awesome even though our band is destined to be in this game if you want to try

2076
02:40:47,080 --> 02:40:51,400
and compete against us you piddly fools or you have a friend who's in a band who

2077
02:40:51,400 --> 02:40:58,480
is feeling like competing against us fools go to www.beaguitarhero.com and

2078
02:40:58,480 --> 02:41:09,280
submit your entry and you too can be a guitar hero all right I guess since

2079
02:41:09,280 --> 02:41:11,280
There's no questions for AskOrangeLohan.

2080
02:41:11,280 --> 02:41:16,280
Ask us a question or we will talk about the Lindsay Lohan.

2081
02:41:16,280 --> 02:41:18,280
No, we'll go to a quick break.

2082
02:41:18,280 --> 02:41:19,280
We're going to do like a quick little Tucson break.

2083
02:41:19,280 --> 02:41:22,280
But I want to talk about Lindsay Lohan.

2084
02:41:22,280 --> 02:41:26,280
I want to talk about, well, I have BeatMania on my PSP.

2085
02:41:26,280 --> 02:41:28,280
Tell us about this then.

2086
02:41:28,280 --> 02:41:31,280
I have a Game Boy Color emulator called Rin on there,

2087
02:41:31,280 --> 02:41:34,280
and I found a ROM for BeatMania 2.

2088
02:41:34,280 --> 02:41:37,280
And so now I have BeatMania on my PSP.

2089
02:41:37,280 --> 02:41:40,280
As well as DDR, but I took DDR off there because that was annoying.

2090
02:41:40,280 --> 02:41:45,280
I found that DDR2 for the Game Boy Color had all the solo songs in it, though.

2091
02:41:45,280 --> 02:41:49,280
In their 8-bit glory.

2092
02:41:49,280 --> 02:41:56,280
But Hot Limit's in there. I gotta pull up Hot Limit. That'd be funny. We'll play that.

2093
02:41:56,280 --> 02:41:57,280
Alright.

2094
02:41:57,280 --> 02:42:03,280
Oh, this is probably going to make my heart hurt or something.

2095
02:42:03,280 --> 02:42:08,280
If I wind up in the hospital because of hearing this song, and I die there, I'm going to haunt you.

2096
02:42:09,280 --> 02:42:10,280
Just thought I'd let you know.

2097
02:42:10,280 --> 02:42:13,280
Do you think Lindsay Lohan looks better with red hair or her new blonde hair?

2098
02:42:13,280 --> 02:42:14,280
I think the red hair looks better.

2099
02:42:14,280 --> 02:42:15,280
I don't care!

2100
02:42:15,280 --> 02:42:18,280
I think, I think though she needs to eat something.

2101
02:42:18,280 --> 02:42:20,280
Yes, she needs to eat something.

2102
02:42:20,280 --> 02:42:21,280
Did you hear about that website?

2103
02:42:21,280 --> 02:42:23,280
Eat Lindsay, or Free Lindsay or something?

2104
02:42:23,280 --> 02:42:24,280
What?

2105
02:42:24,280 --> 02:42:25,280
What is it?

2106
02:42:25,280 --> 02:42:27,280
EatSomethingLindsayorSomething.com

2107
02:42:27,280 --> 02:42:28,280
Or is a petition going around trying to-

2108
02:42:28,280 --> 02:42:30,280
It smells like fresh Lindsay in here!

2109
02:42:30,280 --> 02:42:38,760
here. Is that your Lindsay that I see? Maybe. Are you talking about my Lindsay? Maybe. Alright,

2110
02:42:38,760 --> 02:42:41,680
we're starting to get some questions for Ask Orange Lounge, so I guess we should go into

2111
02:42:41,680 --> 02:42:48,120
that segment, should we? Yes? Do you got that song for us yet? I'm working on it, I'm working

2112
02:42:48,120 --> 02:42:59,320
on it. Alright, here we go. We'll go into Ask Orange Lounge first. This sounds like

2113
02:42:59,320 --> 02:43:06,320
like a Mega Man game or something.

2114
02:43:12,320 --> 02:43:13,320
This is not a hot limit.

2115
02:43:13,320 --> 02:43:17,320
Oh, here we go.

2116
02:43:17,320 --> 02:43:24,320
Wow.

2117
02:43:47,320 --> 02:43:54,320
do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do a-a-a-a. Interesting.

2118
02:43:54,920 --> 02:44:01,160
All right let's get to the questions. Enough of that.

2119
02:44:01,160 --> 02:44:03,740
feedlindsay.com

2120
02:44:03,740 --> 02:44:07,200
Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question,

2121
02:44:07,200 --> 02:44:10,680
well will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio.

2122
02:44:10,680 --> 02:44:14,440
Is Lindsay better as a redhead or is she a buck some blonde?

2123
02:44:14,440 --> 02:44:18,440
I don't know, you tell me, but secretly I think she's not fat.

2124
02:44:22,440 --> 02:44:24,440
I have boobies on my PSP.

2125
02:44:24,440 --> 02:44:26,440
I hate having to improvise that song every week.

2126
02:44:27,440 --> 02:44:31,440
First question from Sakurina. Can you not talk about Lindsay Lohan?

2127
02:44:32,440 --> 02:44:37,440
Oh my god, did you hear what she did last week? This is so awesome.

2128
02:44:37,440 --> 02:44:40,520
them

2129
02:44:40,520 --> 02:44:45,780
but come on i thought that i saw her be the look no forget it i'm going to try

2130
02:44:45,780 --> 02:44:49,340
and peak you want to know why does nobody asked questions i think the

2131
02:44:49,340 --> 02:44:52,760
reason nobody asked questions is because we do this almost every other week and

2132
02:44:52,760 --> 02:44:54,280
we really need a new bed

2133
02:44:54,280 --> 02:44:56,400
but we're just not feeling creative

2134
02:44:56,400 --> 02:45:00,460
honestly maybe for episode one fifty which is next week by the way

2135
02:45:00,460 --> 02:45:03,200
we'll have something new and fresh for you guys but until then it's the same

2136
02:45:03,200 --> 02:45:10,200
old stale shit you know and love.

2137
02:45:33,200 --> 02:45:35,200
Well, there's pictures of us online.

2138
02:45:35,200 --> 02:45:37,200
They're little, little bitty pictures. Hold on, let me show you.

2139
02:45:37,200 --> 02:45:39,200
I have not seen them.

2140
02:45:39,200 --> 02:45:41,200
Yes, you have. I showed this to you last week.

2141
02:45:41,200 --> 02:45:43,200
It's on our website, right? I haven't seen this, actually.

2142
02:45:43,200 --> 02:45:45,200
Hold on, hold on, hold on. Let me bring it up.

2143
02:45:45,200 --> 02:45:47,200
Now you're making me work.

2144
02:45:47,200 --> 02:45:49,200
You better work!

2145
02:45:49,200 --> 02:45:53,200
No, I haven't seen this, because I was trying to come up with something that I didn't.

2146
02:45:53,200 --> 02:45:55,200
Mmm.

2147
02:45:55,200 --> 02:45:58,200
Orange lion. Oh, sorry, I had to bring it up the pocket. There it is!

2148
02:45:58,200 --> 02:46:04,200
See? I like that. See? Me, DarkSakura, Loki, Ferret.

2149
02:46:04,200 --> 02:46:08,200
What's that on? That's our album art for our podcast.

2150
02:46:08,200 --> 02:46:10,200
Oh, really? Yeah. That's great.

2151
02:46:10,200 --> 02:46:13,200
I posted it on our forum. Hey, that's the icon that I made.

2152
02:46:13,200 --> 02:46:16,200
Yeah, that's the old-ass icon you made, and then I did the border around it, so we kind of co-made it.

2153
02:46:16,200 --> 02:46:18,200
That's fun. That's cool.

2154
02:46:18,200 --> 02:46:22,200
And the Ferret is our official fourth co-host. Yes.

2155
02:46:22,200 --> 02:46:26,200
She says the same thing every time, though.

2156
02:46:26,200 --> 02:46:28,200
No, we should totally get sponsorship from Scusi.

2157
02:46:28,200 --> 02:46:30,200
We totally should.

2158
02:46:30,200 --> 02:46:33,200
We pimp those ferrets like nothing else.

2159
02:46:33,200 --> 02:46:35,200
God, we really do.

2160
02:46:35,200 --> 02:46:40,200
Ronchan wants to know, can I be the band manager and book y'all at the Apollo Theater?

2161
02:46:40,200 --> 02:46:42,200
Fuck yeah, bring it on.

2162
02:46:42,200 --> 02:46:45,200
Oh, fuck no, we'd get booed off at the Apollo.

2163
02:46:45,200 --> 02:46:47,200
You know what?

2164
02:46:47,200 --> 02:46:50,200
Spelling bee at the Apollo!

2165
02:46:50,200 --> 02:46:59,240
Asphyxiation! A-S-F-I-X-O-N! No. Actually, I have heard somebody try to spell asphyxiation

2166
02:46:59,240 --> 02:47:02,040
that way. It was just sad.

2167
02:47:02,040 --> 02:47:06,440
MPQ is making an interesting suggestion. He says, and this is actually live in the chat

2168
02:47:06,440 --> 02:47:09,440
room at orange-on-the-radio.com. Click on chat. He didn't send his over private message,

2169
02:47:09,440 --> 02:47:14,520
but he says, let's play the wolf game next week in the chat and radio-ize it. You know

2170
02:47:14,520 --> 02:47:18,920
what? I'm not against the idea of doing like some type of broadcasted the wolf game, but

2171
02:47:18,920 --> 02:47:21,240
But I don't know how that would work with the chat.

2172
02:47:21,240 --> 02:47:22,760
We'd have to have live people.

2173
02:47:22,760 --> 02:47:23,480
Could be interesting, though.

2174
02:47:23,480 --> 02:47:24,640
Could be very interesting.

2175
02:47:24,640 --> 02:47:29,280
I'd have to think about the, what do you call that,

2176
02:47:29,280 --> 02:47:31,880
schematics, the way it would work.

2177
02:47:31,880 --> 02:47:32,640
Let me think about that one.

2178
02:47:32,640 --> 02:47:34,680
MPQ, if you have an idea on how we could do that and

2179
02:47:34,680 --> 02:47:36,960
actually have it be good radio, send me an email.

2180
02:47:36,960 --> 02:47:37,920
We'll talk.

2181
02:47:37,920 --> 02:47:39,480
Might be fun.

2182
02:47:39,480 --> 02:47:40,400
I'm liking this.

2183
02:47:40,400 --> 02:47:42,520
I'm liking this.

2184
02:47:42,520 --> 02:47:44,000
All right.

2185
02:47:44,000 --> 02:47:45,640
We have no more questions, you guys.

2186
02:47:45,640 --> 02:47:46,600
Who's?

2187
02:47:46,600 --> 02:47:47,440
Email what?

2188
02:47:47,440 --> 02:47:53,320
what? We need to have questions. This is what we do, usually when we get no questions, is

2189
02:47:53,320 --> 02:48:00,320
that we can ask each other questions. Rob, why are you so fabulous? Because I am a diva.

2190
02:48:00,320 --> 02:48:09,320
Hey Rob, why am I so famous? Because you're a diva. Because I'm a diva. Angel, you haven't

2191
02:48:09,320 --> 02:48:12,560

2196
02:48:41,200 --> 02:48:45,160
I'm starting to like that idea I want to figure that one out. All right let's um

SmileDK this break. Enjoy. We'll be back after this.

2202
02:49:30,600 --> 02:49:33,100
Just a little bit of me to say

02:49:33,100 --> 02:49:36,100
You know you gotta try a little harder

2204
02:49:36,100 --> 02:49:39,600
Or you can be my, my, my, my darlin'

2205

That you feel the same way too

2213
02:49:55,100 --> 02:49:59,600
And hope we'll be together now

2214
02:49:59,600 --> 02:50:07,560
You know that I love you, love you, love you love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you...

2215
02:50:07,560 --> 02:50:10,520
When I'm sitting thinking of,

2216
02:50:10,520 --> 02:50:13,860
The funny one we called love,

2217
02:50:13,860 --> 02:50:16,640
Still don't think of you at first,

2218
02:50:16,640 --> 02:50:20,140
My family, they come so far...

2219
02:50:20,140 --> 02:50:23,200
If you wanna capture me,

2220
02:50:23,200 --> 02:50:26,240
It's as simple as can be,

2221
02:50:26,240 --> 02:50:29,260
Mr. Leonard said it all, you need it,

2222
02:50:29,260 --> 02:50:32,340
Mix a little set it all, you need it

2223
02:50:32,780 --> 02:50:35,180
Mix a little set it all, you need it

2224
02:50:35,220 --> 02:50:38,200
Love, my love my love my love my love

2225
02:50:38,280 --> 02:50:41,440
My love my love my love my love my love

2226
02:50:41,440 --> 02:50:42,440
Let's go!

2227
02:51:11,440 --> 02:51:23,440
I'm so much love, always something's all I know

2228
02:51:23,440 --> 02:51:26,440
I'm trying not to kill me, yeah

2229
02:51:26,440 --> 02:51:29,440
I'm all that I wish to do is turn inside and out

2230
02:51:29,440 --> 02:51:32,440
We cry bitches everywhere

2231
02:51:32,440 --> 02:51:35,440
I'm just figuring out what's left and find some fun

2232
02:51:35,440 --> 02:51:39,440
It's time to get excited, so come on everybody

2233
02:51:39,440 --> 02:51:42,440
Boys, boys, be my boy, I wanna feel your body

2234
02:51:42,440 --> 02:51:45,440
Boys, boys, be my boy, you got a ranny, honey

2235
02:51:45,440 --> 02:51:49,440
Boys, boys, be my boy, I wanna be your lover now

2236
02:51:49,440 --> 02:51:51,440
Be my boy

2237
02:51:51,440 --> 02:52:19,440
Boy, boy, be my boy

2238
02:52:19,440 --> 02:52:39,600
We're back here on Orange Lounge Radio, coming here to wrap it all up. You know when I get

2239
02:52:39,600 --> 02:52:43,160
bored though as I start looking through popular DDR forums to see what the kids are talking

2240
02:52:43,160 --> 02:52:48,920
about and why is it that on DDR forums there is always this kind of topic at

2241
02:52:48,920 --> 02:52:52,440
least on DDR freak and some of the other big ones there's always this kind of

2242
02:52:52,440 --> 02:52:56,920
topic within the first three pages of a forum have you ever met your boyfriend

2243
02:52:56,920 --> 02:53:02,760
or girlfriend through DDR I don't know how about it guys have you ever met your

2244
02:53:02,760 --> 02:53:08,440
boyfriend girl the topic it keeps popping up on every incarnation of DDR

2245
02:53:08,440 --> 02:53:16,440
freak, and honestly, as a moderator, I'm not even saying it! Fucking people, stop posting inane crap!

2246
02:53:16,440 --> 02:53:20,440
Why can't we have intelligent conversation? Like...

2247
02:53:20,440 --> 02:53:24,440
Well, some people did meet their boyfriend or girlfriend through DDR, which I think is...

2248
02:53:24,440 --> 02:53:26,440
But this is an old thread.

2249
02:53:26,440 --> 02:53:28,440
Yeah, I did, but what business of it is yours?

2250
02:53:28,440 --> 02:53:30,440
Ha ha ha ha!

2251
02:53:30,440 --> 02:53:34,440
Well, that is the first time I've ever heard Angel say something snide. It's great.

2252
02:53:34,440 --> 02:53:36,440
I'm learning! Oh my God, we're corrupting you!

2253
02:53:36,440 --> 02:53:38,440
I live with Andrew!

2254
02:53:38,440 --> 02:53:40,440
Oh, did I say that out loud?

2255
02:53:40,440 --> 02:53:44,440
Oh, that was beautiful.

2256
02:53:44,440 --> 02:53:46,440
Save that one for the archives.

2257
02:53:46,440 --> 02:53:48,440
Angel gets mean. Episode 149.

2258
02:53:48,440 --> 02:53:52,440
Finally, after, uh, how many episodes?

2259
02:53:52,440 --> 02:53:56,440
Maybe it's sitting next to Loki lately.

2260
02:53:56,440 --> 02:53:58,440
He's starting to rub off on you or something.

2261
02:53:58,440 --> 02:54:02,440
Either that or it's, um, I don't know.

2262
02:54:02,440 --> 02:54:05,400
all of our randomness coming off on me?

2263
02:54:08,400 --> 02:54:13,640
Maybe people post this topic because they're sad because

2264
02:54:13,640 --> 02:54:15,960
they want to meet a girl through DDR.

2265
02:54:15,960 --> 02:54:18,400
They're sad and lonely, and they want to meet a girl with

2266
02:54:18,400 --> 02:54:20,600
similar interests as them.

2267
02:54:20,600 --> 02:54:21,960
Here's the hint.

2268
02:54:21,960 --> 02:54:25,040
They want to meet a girl with similar interests as you.

2269
02:54:25,040 --> 02:54:30,240
Go outside and participate in those interests that you have.

2270
02:54:30,240 --> 02:54:32,680
Because if you want to find a girl that plays DDR,

2271
02:54:32,680 --> 02:54:35,720
you know where you're likely to find that girl that plays DDR?

2272
02:54:35,720 --> 02:54:36,520
I don't know.

2273
02:54:36,520 --> 02:54:39,360
Out playing DDR somewhere.

2274
02:54:39,360 --> 02:54:40,960
Food for thought.

2275
02:54:40,960 --> 02:54:44,640
So my advice, if you're lonely, and sad, and single,

2276
02:54:44,640 --> 02:54:45,880
and you want to meet somebody.

2277
02:54:45,880 --> 02:54:48,800
And you know what, I'm a lonely, sad, single guy, but I try.

2278
02:54:48,800 --> 02:54:51,160
I go out and do things I enjoy, because that

2279
02:54:51,160 --> 02:54:55,520
is where I'm likely to meet people who have similar interests that I have.

2280
02:54:55,520 --> 02:54:56,960
So I suggest you all do the same.

2281
02:54:56,960 --> 02:55:01,360
of course now we've got all these

2282
02:55:01,360 --> 02:55:07,960
comments here in the chat room there. What are you talking about upskirt cam for DarkSakura?

2283
02:55:07,960 --> 02:55:11,680
I was doing that just to make fun of the DDR stuff.

2284
02:55:11,680 --> 02:55:16,480
Oh. Yeah that's when I got subjected to that in 2003.

2285
02:55:16,480 --> 02:55:21,000
Okay I'm not funny. See? Wait whoa whoa whoa whoa.

2286
02:55:21,000 --> 02:55:26,200
You were in an upskirt cam video? Angel was not in an upskirt cam video!

2287
02:55:26,200 --> 02:55:30,960
no I got subjected to the term upskirt cam in 2003

2288
02:55:30,960 --> 02:55:34,200
I get it I get it

2289
02:55:34,200 --> 02:55:39,160
all right kids it's time we end this train wreck of a show

2290
02:55:39,160 --> 02:55:43,600
put the nails in the coffin go around and get everybody's final thought next

2291
02:55:43,600 --> 02:55:47,160
week boys and girls it's episode 150

2292
02:55:47,160 --> 02:55:51,160
holy crap are we getting old

2293
02:55:51,160 --> 02:55:58,160
69. I don't remember 69, because I was... Wait, your mic's off, I think. No, it's not.

2294
02:55:58,840 --> 02:56:03,840
There... Ooh, it died for me. Yeah, the mic is going out. There you go. I don't remember

2295
02:56:03,840 --> 02:56:07,840
episode 69, because I was in San Diego living under the stairs in the Harry Potter room.

2296
02:56:07,840 --> 02:56:13,080
I remember that. You weren't... It was a gay frat. That was great. Alright. So I don't

2297
02:56:13,080 --> 02:56:16,800
know, what are we going to do... I was surrounded by all these cute guys, and they were all

2298
02:56:16,800 --> 02:56:21,080
gay. What are we going to do for episode 150? I mean, that's a pretty big number. I don't

2299
02:56:21,080 --> 02:56:22,080
I say it's time we-

2300
02:56:22,080 --> 02:56:23,080
JUNK SHUT UP!

2301
02:56:23,080 --> 02:56:24,080
No.

2302
02:56:24,080 --> 02:56:25,080
I say it's time we-

2303
02:56:25,080 --> 02:56:26,080
No.

2304
02:56:26,080 --> 02:56:27,080
No more of those for a long time.

2305
02:56:27,080 --> 02:56:28,080
No.

2306
02:56:28,080 --> 02:56:29,080
No, no, no, no, no.

2307
02:56:29,080 --> 02:56:30,080
I say we set the ferret on fire.

2308
02:56:30,080 --> 02:56:31,080
NO!

2309
02:56:31,080 --> 02:56:32,080
Oh my god, Rob, no.

2310
02:56:32,080 --> 02:56:33,080
Ah.

2311
02:56:33,080 --> 02:56:34,080
There we go.

2312
02:56:34,080 --> 02:56:35,080
All right.

2313
02:56:35,080 --> 02:56:39,080
We could rent a wood chipper and throw the ferret through a wood chipper.

2314
02:56:39,080 --> 02:56:40,080
Yes.

2315
02:56:40,080 --> 02:56:41,680
Okay, what?

2316
02:56:41,680 --> 02:56:44,720
We'll just try- we'll try performing surgery on that a little later.

2317
02:56:44,720 --> 02:56:45,720
Here, here.

2318
02:56:45,720 --> 02:56:46,720
Let me try something.

2319
02:56:46,720 --> 02:56:48,440
Here, let's switch for a minute.

2320
02:56:48,440 --> 02:56:53,240
What the fuck did the ferret ever do to you, okay?

2321
02:56:53,240 --> 02:56:55,780
The ferret has been good to you.

2322
02:56:55,780 --> 02:56:56,780
The ferret has been nice.

2323
02:56:56,780 --> 02:56:57,780
Check, check.

2324
02:56:57,780 --> 02:56:58,780
Here we go.

2325
02:56:58,780 --> 02:57:07,440
The ferret has been very good to you, yet you treat it so horribly.

2326
02:57:07,440 --> 02:57:12,520
I mean, do you have some sort of deep-rooted fear of ferrets?

2327
02:57:12,520 --> 02:57:15,920
You know, ferret bias, or...

2328
02:57:15,920 --> 02:57:19,040
We're going to land ourselves an extra special guest for episode 150, we're going to work

2329
02:57:19,040 --> 02:57:20,040
on that.

2330
02:57:20,040 --> 02:57:21,040
You know what I would love to get?

2331
02:57:21,040 --> 02:57:24,700
I should send an email this week, see if I can make it happen, because I have connections.

2332
02:57:24,700 --> 02:57:28,440
We should get some of the folks that made In the Groove on the show to argue with Loki.

2333
02:57:28,440 --> 02:57:29,440
I think it would be beautiful.

2334
02:57:29,440 --> 02:57:30,920
Oh my god, Rob.

2335
02:57:30,920 --> 02:57:33,040
You just got a song stuck in my head.

2336
02:57:33,040 --> 02:57:34,040
Do it!

2337
02:57:34,040 --> 02:57:35,040
Do it!

2338
02:57:35,040 --> 02:57:36,040
That connected song.

2339
02:57:36,040 --> 02:57:37,040
The Get Yourself Connected.

2340
02:57:37,040 --> 02:57:40,200
Who was it that did that fucking song?

2341
02:57:40,200 --> 02:57:42,200
This shit is bananas.

2342
02:57:42,200 --> 02:57:43,200
B-A-N.

2343
02:57:43,200 --> 02:57:44,200
No, forget it.

2344
02:57:44,200 --> 02:57:45,200
It's on the wall.

2345
02:57:45,200 --> 02:57:48,200
Alright, alright. The chat room is suggesting we have an orgy.

2346
02:57:48,200 --> 02:57:50,200
I think that was Fluke.

2347
02:57:50,200 --> 02:57:54,200
Episode 150 is Girls Only. Yeah, screw you. Screw you. Thank you.

2348
02:57:54,200 --> 02:57:56,200
Alright, let's go around and do it by a final thought.

2349
02:57:56,200 --> 02:57:58,200
Yeah, Girls Only. All breaks would be...

2350
02:57:58,200 --> 02:58:00,200
Girls...

2351
02:58:00,200 --> 02:58:02,200
Girls.

2352
02:58:02,200 --> 02:58:04,200
It took me a minute to get that joke.

2353
02:58:04,200 --> 02:58:06,200
Alright Angel, your final thought.

2354
02:58:06,200 --> 02:58:10,200
Meteors was interesting, but I'm still playing it.

2355
02:58:10,200 --> 02:58:11,200
Loki.

2356
02:58:11,200 --> 02:58:18,200
is hard to play on a PSP, or Game Boy Advance for that matter, or Game Boy Color. My final

2357
02:58:18,200 --> 02:58:25,200
thought is, word around the office is you got a fat cock. Dark Sakura. I don't know

2358
02:58:25,200 --> 02:58:36,200
how I can top that one. I do. You should have seen how her eyes looked all of a sudden.

2359
02:58:36,200 --> 02:58:46,200
I'm gonna report you to HR! Oh, wait. I am HR. Guess what we do. We flog.

2360
02:58:46,200 --> 02:58:49,200
Nah, we're all up for those medieval forms of...

2361
02:58:49,200 --> 02:58:51,200
They flog the dolphin.

2362
02:58:51,200 --> 02:58:54,200
Well, I was gonna go flog the...

2363
02:58:54,200 --> 02:58:57,200
No, forget it.

2364
02:58:57,200 --> 02:59:01,200
No, we use, like, whips and chains and...

2365
02:59:01,200 --> 02:59:05,280
Okay, it's, it's, I was telling somebody about an anime called Star Trap,

2366
02:59:05,280 --> 02:59:09,280
Ascenders of the Universe, so I'm going to go ahead and quote a line for that.

2367
02:59:09,280 --> 02:59:14,280
Eat me, beat me, make me write bad checks.

2368
02:59:14,280 --> 02:59:18,280
And the final word of the show, one word to sum the whole damn thing up.

2369
02:59:18,280 --> 02:59:22,280
I'm going to give it to DDR Angel, come on Angel, you haven't been here for a month.

2370
02:59:22,280 --> 02:59:24,280
One word, sum it all up.

2371
02:59:24,280 --> 02:59:28,280
Uh, that's it, bye.

2372
02:59:28,280 --> 02:59:34,280
That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.

2376
03:00:17,280 --> 03:00:26,480
Was it just, was it just, was it just, yeah, was it just, was it just what you were?

2377
03:00:26,480 --> 03:00:30,480
Worlds were in the space between us, I should have made a sacrifice,

2378
03:00:30,480 --> 03:00:36,480
Or tried to meet a set of standards, I had a pretty good selection, of masters of the universe,

2379
03:00:36,480 --> 03:00:40,480
I had Boba Fett and Greedo, and I was close to 17,

2380
03:00:40,480 --> 03:00:44,480
C.S.A. took Dr. Connick any log, and she knew how to pass with J,

2381
03:00:44,480 --> 03:00:48,480
Shitty head eyes and look around for the boys who lie his legs to go to hate

2382
03:00:53,480 --> 03:00:57,480
At the time I was working on a novel, just another proof of my distraction

2383
03:00:57,480 --> 03:01:00,480
I come first wondering what she would think of that

2384
03:01:01,480 --> 03:01:05,480
What if I had wilder words of fiction, overwind and crack a smile lakeside

2385
03:01:05,480 --> 03:01:09,480
When she had just moved back up and moonwalked home

2386
03:01:09,480 --> 03:01:11,480
There was a girl she took away

2387
03:01:11,480 --> 03:01:13,480
While we're in the space between us

2388
03:01:13,480 --> 03:01:15,480
I guess I should have made a sacrifice

2389
03:01:15,480 --> 03:01:17,480
Or tried to meet her down at Sanders

2390
03:01:17,480 --> 03:01:19,480
But she didn't have respect for her strength

2391
03:01:19,480 --> 03:01:21,480
As I didn't have the strength for that

2392
03:01:21,480 --> 03:01:23,480
Ruben's shoes burned on my style

2393
03:01:23,480 --> 03:01:25,480
And they're still not, I was in the D&D

2394
03:01:25,480 --> 03:01:30,240
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na na

2395
03:01:55,480 --> 03:02:07,160
When I look back upon the 80s I never get pissed off at Ronald Reagan

2396
03:02:07,160 --> 03:02:13,240
I never paid attention to him back then But that chick who wore the parachute pants

2397
03:02:13,240 --> 03:02:15,240
The one who broke my heart, the one who broke hands

2398
03:02:15,240 --> 03:02:22,240
I just hope that one day we'll meet again I'm not sure, I'm not sure, I'm not sure

2399
03:02:22,240 --> 03:02:25,240
So I'm not sure, I'm not sure what I would do

2400
03:02:25,240 --> 03:02:27,240
I'm not sure it even matters

2401
03:02:27,240 --> 03:02:31,240
Because I know where everything is and she's got stuff stuck up in her ass

2402
03:02:31,240 --> 03:02:33,240
And it flows through the doors of my distance

2403
03:02:33,240 --> 03:02:36,240
She can only, she can only, she can only

2404
03:02:36,240 --> 03:02:43,240
Eat us up alive, eat us up alive

2405
03:02:43,240 --> 03:02:59,840
La, la, la, la, la, la...

2406
03:02:59,840 --> 03:03:06,840
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.

2407
03:03:29,840 --> 03:03:47,840
Closing time. You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here. That's it. Show's over.

2408
03:03:47,840 --> 03:03:52,840
So piss off! Can I come back next week? No, yeah, come back in 15 seconds, because we're

2409
03:03:52,840 --> 03:03:55,840
going to reconnect to the Beaumonti Music and More program with all your favorite TDR

2410
03:03:55,840 --> 03:03:59,840
And listen to my show Tuesday, Pump Up the Lame.

2411
03:03:59,840 --> 03:04:00,840
And listen to the podcast, because we're cool.

2412
03:04:00,840 --> 03:04:01,840
Good night everybody!

2413
03:04:01,840 --> 03:04:02,340
Bye.
