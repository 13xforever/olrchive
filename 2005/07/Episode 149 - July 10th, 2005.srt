The following live program is a special presentation of Orange Lounge Radio

3
00:01:18,837 --> 00:01:28,725
[SPEAKER_25]: Tonight on Orange Lounge Radio, episode 149, the aftermath of Loki's violent, drunken episode last week.

4
00:01:29,125 --> 00:01:30,847
[SPEAKER_25]: Should be entertaining to get the follow-up on.

5
00:01:31,367 --> 00:01:38,673
[SPEAKER_25]: Also, be careful, because if you put out there something with four arrows, it is possible that Konami is going to sue you next.

6
00:01:39,073 --> 00:01:40,595
[SPEAKER_25]: We'll talk about that on tonight's show.

7
00:01:40,755 --> 00:01:44,838
[SPEAKER_25]: Also, just the randomness you're used to from us.

8
00:01:44,898 --> 00:01:45,679
[SPEAKER_25]: Isn't that right, Jamie?

9
00:01:53,576 --> 00:02:00,624
[SPEAKER_25]: All this and a follow-up story if she's sticking around on the Orange Lounge Radio Lesbians for a little bit.

10
00:02:01,185 --> 00:02:01,866
[SPEAKER_25]: Geeks are hot.

11
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:07,032
[SPEAKER_24]: We'll get to that after this introduction.

00:02:18,469 --> 00:02:21,572
[SPEAKER_19]: Orange Lounge Radio is presented in the TMI sound format.

19
00:03:30,471 --> 00:03:34,212
[SPEAKER_25]: Orange Lounge Radio will not contain any of that in this episode.

27
00:04:43,823 --> 00:04:44,503
[SPEAKER_25]: Sorry to hear that.

28
00:04:44,543 --> 00:04:47,525
[SPEAKER_25]: Didn't you have lots of larves last night, though?

29
00:04:47,945 --> 00:04:49,566
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, yeah, I split and fell George Carlin.

30
00:04:50,466 --> 00:04:50,786
[SPEAKER_25]: Awesome.

31
00:04:50,966 --> 00:04:54,088
[SPEAKER_25]: We'll get the scoop on that during the How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day bit.

32
00:04:54,348 --> 00:04:54,468
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

33
00:04:54,994 --> 00:04:59,815
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, well, we'll find out what's bumming you out, too, and if we need to, we'll have to give you a hug.

34
00:05:00,356 --> 00:05:01,196
[SPEAKER_25]: We'll give you a big hug.

35
00:05:01,436 --> 00:05:01,656
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay.

36
00:05:01,876 --> 00:05:02,076

38
00:05:08,518 --> 00:05:08,718
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah.

39
00:05:09,679 --> 00:05:09,899
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

40
00:05:10,539 --> 00:05:14,160
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, because our chatroom loves to hear the two songs overlapping each other.

41
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:14,620
[SPEAKER_25]: Very nice.

42
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:15,780
[SPEAKER_25]: How are you doing, TechMassaLoki?

43
00:05:16,261 --> 00:05:16,961
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm doing good.

44
00:05:17,501 --> 00:05:18,321
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm glad to hear that.

45
00:05:18,441 --> 00:05:19,201
[SPEAKER_25]: How are you feeling?

46
00:05:19,822 --> 00:05:20,282
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm fine.

47
00:05:20,942 --> 00:05:23,123
[SPEAKER_25]: How many times did you Ralph after the show was over?

48
00:05:23,143 --> 00:05:23,183
[SPEAKER_25]: Um...

49
00:05:25,154 --> 00:05:29,037
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't remember too much, whatever was here, and then that was it.

50
00:05:29,598 --> 00:05:31,440
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright, we'll get to that a little later.

51
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:41,608
[SPEAKER_25]: Also, joining us Elise for a little bit, she's about to go run and get some ice cream, but the official lesbian of Orange Lounge Radio, did we give you a nickname?

52
00:05:41,769 --> 00:05:43,290
[SPEAKER_25]: Precious Amanda.

53
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:46,072
[SPEAKER_03]: Mandarin, or Manders, whatever.

54
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:48,374
[SPEAKER_25]: But you have a follow-up to this, don't you?

55
00:05:48,895 --> 00:05:50,076
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not a lesbian anymore.

56
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:56,433
[SPEAKER_25]: as the straight listeners breathe a sigh of disappointment.

57
00:05:57,293 --> 00:05:57,953
[SPEAKER_25]: What happened?

58
00:05:59,854 --> 00:06:03,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Um... She wasn't very nice.

59
00:06:05,975 --> 00:06:07,955
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't work out.

60
00:06:07,975 --> 00:06:09,236
[SPEAKER_25]: She ruined it for everyone.

61
00:06:09,776 --> 00:06:11,056
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty much.

62
00:06:11,116 --> 00:06:15,517
[SPEAKER_03]: Chicks are still hot, but I have a boyfriend and yeah.

63
00:06:15,857 --> 00:06:16,437
[SPEAKER_03]: I like dick.

64
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:18,657
[SPEAKER_25]: Go eat ice cream.

65
00:06:18,677 --> 00:06:19,978
[SPEAKER_03]: Get off our show.

66
00:06:21,499 --> 00:06:22,099
[SPEAKER_03]: BabyPandaBorn

67
00:06:50,413 --> 00:06:51,954
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on baby, let's dream a dream together

68
00:07:18,108 --> 00:07:20,922
[SPEAKER_18]: A dream that is real

69
00:08:56,192 --> 00:08:56,933
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

70
00:11:23,505 --> 00:11:24,676
Thank you for watching

71
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:00,215
Come on, come out

73
00:13:32,149 --> 00:13:35,450
[SPEAKER_25]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 149.

74
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:37,650
[SPEAKER_25]: How you guys doing tonight?

75
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:39,891
[SPEAKER_25]: Happy Sunday to you guys out there.

76
00:13:40,531 --> 00:13:43,051
[SPEAKER_25]: I can't believe it's already like mid-July.

77
00:13:43,151 --> 00:13:44,532
[SPEAKER_25]: Where did this year go?

78
00:13:44,672 --> 00:13:50,253
[SPEAKER_25]: It seems like it's just, I feel my age slipping away as the days keep flying by.

79
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:52,553
[SPEAKER_25]: Is anyone else feeling incredibly old this evening?

80
00:13:52,573 --> 00:13:53,073
[SPEAKER_25]: Maybe it was just me.

81
00:13:53,513 --> 00:13:53,653
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

82
00:13:53,673 --> 00:13:54,954
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just you.

83
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:55,554
[SPEAKER_25]: No.

84
00:13:55,914 --> 00:13:56,194
[SPEAKER_25]: All right.

85
00:13:57,213 --> 00:13:57,533
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Rob.

86
00:13:57,734 --> 00:13:57,934
[SPEAKER_25]: What?

87
00:13:58,034 --> 00:13:58,214
[SPEAKER_25]: Rob.

88
00:13:58,234 --> 00:13:58,455
[SPEAKER_25]: What?

89
00:13:58,595 --> 00:13:58,775
[SPEAKER_25]: Rob.

90
00:13:58,815 --> 00:13:58,975
[SPEAKER_25]: What?

91
00:13:59,015 --> 00:13:59,536
[SPEAKER_25]: Rob.

92
00:13:59,676 --> 00:13:59,977
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

93
00:14:00,037 --> 00:14:00,377
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob.

94
00:14:00,457 --> 00:14:00,738
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

95
00:14:00,938 --> 00:14:01,198
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob.

96
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:01,799
[SPEAKER_23]: What?

97
00:14:04,202 --> 00:14:04,483
[SPEAKER_23]: Bitch.

98
00:14:05,544 --> 00:14:05,844
[SPEAKER_25]: So?

99
00:14:05,965 --> 00:14:06,265
[SPEAKER_25]: Kisses.

100
00:14:07,667 --> 00:14:10,128
[SPEAKER_25]: First off, I want to thank Loki.

101
00:14:10,288 --> 00:14:13,789
[SPEAKER_25]: I want to give hearts to Loki because he got me a late birthday present.

102
00:14:13,829 --> 00:14:18,070
[SPEAKER_25]: He bought me Kirby Canvas Curse, the DS, and you can paint rainbows in that game.

103
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:19,870
[SPEAKER_25]: So I'm very excited to go paint me some rainbows.

104
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:20,650
[SPEAKER_25]: So that'll be fun.

105
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:21,851
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Loki.

106
00:14:22,191 --> 00:14:25,452
[SPEAKER_07]: As soon as I get paid, I can get your present, but I've been sort of busy moving.

107
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:27,372
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, you did give me the seatbelts.

108
00:14:27,392 --> 00:14:28,772
[SPEAKER_25]: I gave you last year's present.

109
00:14:29,053 --> 00:14:34,794
[SPEAKER_25]: Those are pretty nifty, except I've kind of been afraid to actually put them in my car because I'm afraid they'll get stolen.

110
00:14:35,535 --> 00:14:36,456
[SPEAKER_25]: But I'm going to put them in there.

111
00:14:36,496 --> 00:14:38,418
[SPEAKER_25]: Now that the glass is replaced, I'm going to put them in there.

112
00:14:38,619 --> 00:14:40,041
[SPEAKER_25]: Because they just replaced my glass yesterday.

113
00:14:42,459 --> 00:14:46,263
[SPEAKER_25]: I just hope my freaking car doesn't get broken into again, except I will be getting an alarm this week.

114
00:14:46,323 --> 00:14:49,085
[SPEAKER_25]: I've gotten some leads on some good deals, and I'm very excited.

115
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:53,108
[SPEAKER_25]: For those that are not sure where I'm going with this, my car was broken into.

116
00:14:53,188 --> 00:14:58,333
[SPEAKER_25]: I've lived in this new place where we're doing this show now about, what, about two and a half months?

117
00:14:58,593 --> 00:15:01,275
[SPEAKER_25]: My car's been broken into twice in that span of time.

118
00:15:01,716 --> 00:15:02,877
[SPEAKER_25]: I've had two stereos stolen.

119
00:15:03,157 --> 00:15:06,180
[SPEAKER_25]: The first time, it was funny, because my stereo was actually broken.

120
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:07,681
[SPEAKER_25]: So the thieves stole a broken stereo.

121
00:15:07,961 --> 00:15:13,324
[SPEAKER_25]: Second time, not so funny, because they stole a perfectly fine working stereo and decided to break some glass.

122
00:15:13,985 --> 00:15:19,668
[SPEAKER_25]: And they screwed up the lock on my car, so I have to climb my big butt over the passenger seat every time I want to get in the car.

123
00:15:19,868 --> 00:15:25,752
[SPEAKER_25]: That's payback for having a broken stereo the first time they broke into your car.

124
00:15:25,772 --> 00:15:26,952
[SPEAKER_25]: That's what everybody's telling me.

125
00:15:27,072 --> 00:15:27,913
[SPEAKER_25]: You were being watched.

126
00:15:28,473 --> 00:15:29,854
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm not getting any volume here.

127
00:15:30,777 --> 00:15:31,177
[SPEAKER_25]: No, you're fine.

128
00:15:31,197 --> 00:15:32,938
[SPEAKER_25]: You sound great.

129
00:15:33,478 --> 00:15:35,259
[SPEAKER_25]: Just so you guys know, I have headphones now.

130
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:38,880
[SPEAKER_25]: I finally replaced my headphones after like a month, so I turned them in studio.

131
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,401
[SPEAKER_07]: That's probably fair to the rest of us because now I can't hear myself.

132
00:15:41,461 --> 00:15:42,281
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want me to turn this up?

133
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:42,882
[SPEAKER_07]: A little.

134
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:47,883
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I thought you didn't like it when I... Well, because you talk like you're screaming into the microphone.

135
00:15:48,004 --> 00:15:48,724
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, sorry.

136
00:15:48,744 --> 00:15:49,824
[SPEAKER_07]: You big old loud mouth.

137
00:15:56,045 --> 00:15:59,426
[SPEAKER_25]: DarkSakura, has your car been broken into yet in the new neighborhood?

138
00:15:59,766 --> 00:16:00,706
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, no.

139
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:03,187
[SPEAKER_07]: We can leave the door unlocked for weeks and no one will come in.

140
00:16:03,687 --> 00:16:06,107
[SPEAKER_25]: I know you had the same luck I was having at your old place.

141
00:16:06,167 --> 00:16:08,048
[SPEAKER_07]: Because the old place I lived in was a big sack of shit.

142
00:16:10,048 --> 00:16:10,649
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the truth.

143
00:16:11,689 --> 00:16:16,250
[SPEAKER_25]: Now that you're not living there anymore, do you want to give them a shout out where not to move?

144
00:16:16,815 --> 00:16:17,875
[SPEAKER_07]: Never live at St.

145
00:16:17,895 --> 00:16:22,097
[SPEAKER_07]: Tropez apartments on the corner of Garfield and Marconi in Carmichael.

146
00:16:22,477 --> 00:16:26,658
[SPEAKER_07]: That place is a festering pile of dog crap with worms in it.

147
00:16:28,198 --> 00:16:31,659
[SPEAKER_07]: Even worse, it's the waste put off by a tapeworm.

148
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,800
[SPEAKER_07]: And tapeworms eat waste.

149
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,181
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright, Stalker fans, she doesn't live there anymore, so...

150
00:16:37,665 --> 00:16:38,725
[SPEAKER_25]: It's waste squared.

151
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,166
[SPEAKER_07]: It's waste times infinity.

152
00:16:41,466 --> 00:16:42,606
[SPEAKER_25]: It's super waste.

153
00:16:43,267 --> 00:16:44,287
[SPEAKER_25]: It's uber poo!

154
00:16:44,407 --> 00:16:45,627
[SPEAKER_25]: It's waste extreme.

155
00:16:45,787 --> 00:16:47,348
[SPEAKER_25]: Uh-uh, no, it's uber poo.

156
00:16:47,608 --> 00:16:49,749
[SPEAKER_25]: And Amiro presents Pump It Up Waste.

157
00:16:49,909 --> 00:16:54,530
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, I saw Pump It Up, um, the new Pump It Up in, uh, Vegas, in Reno.

158
00:16:55,299 --> 00:17:01,002
[SPEAKER_25]: I ended up winning plushies out of the crane games I have one of the donkey dragons from whatever spawn of donkey and dragon from Shrek 2

159
00:17:23,767 --> 00:17:24,768
[SPEAKER_07]: and one of the donkey dragons.

160
00:17:24,988 --> 00:17:25,168
[SPEAKER_07]: Cute.

161
00:17:25,308 --> 00:17:26,088
[SPEAKER_07]: And a Hello Kitty.

162
00:17:27,809 --> 00:17:27,969
[SPEAKER_07]: Aww.

163
00:17:28,429 --> 00:17:29,130
[SPEAKER_07]: I love Hello Kitty.

164
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,731
[SPEAKER_07]: And I got, what else did I get?

165
00:17:31,751 --> 00:17:32,511
[SPEAKER_07]: I got one more.

166
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:36,233
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, I played, you know those games where you play basketball?

167
00:17:36,773 --> 00:17:39,615
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, you pay 50 cents and if you hoop you get some type of plushie?

168
00:17:39,635 --> 00:17:40,595
[SPEAKER_07]: I got a plushie fish.

169
00:17:40,915 --> 00:17:41,276
[SPEAKER_17]: Cool.

170
00:17:41,296 --> 00:17:42,456
[SPEAKER_07]: So I beat Julie in the head with it.

171
00:17:43,397 --> 00:17:48,199
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, just because I felt inspired by our chat room with the slap command.

172
00:17:49,099 --> 00:17:51,921
[SPEAKER_07]: I told Julie that it was my homage to the radio station.

173
00:17:51,961 --> 00:17:52,741
[SPEAKER_25]: Your trout command?

174
00:17:53,508 --> 00:17:58,673
[SPEAKER_25]: Slaps Julie with a large trout Julie's car is the suck going uphill She has to turn off the air conditioner

175
00:18:17,282 --> 00:18:18,043
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, it's one of those cars.

176
00:18:18,063 --> 00:18:20,284
[SPEAKER_07]: She's like, I love my fuel-efficient car.

177
00:18:20,424 --> 00:18:21,804
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuel-efficient, fuel-efficient.

178
00:18:22,745 --> 00:18:25,326
[SPEAKER_07]: I like my car that accelerates up hills.

179
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:27,627
[SPEAKER_07]: And doesn't lose speed.

180
00:18:27,807 --> 00:18:29,088
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't have to turn off the air conditioner.

181
00:18:29,748 --> 00:18:32,470
[SPEAKER_07]: It may eat gas, but goddammit, my car is fast.

182
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:34,011
[SPEAKER_25]: That drive to Reno's a bitch, too.

183
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:40,314
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright, anyway, since you're already kind of talking about your weekend, I might as well ask you, how was your week, how was your day, DarkSakura?

184
00:18:41,054 --> 00:18:42,055
[SPEAKER_07]: It was awesome.

185
00:18:42,735 --> 00:18:46,817
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, my week was kind of... But the rest of the week was pretty cute.

186
00:18:47,654 --> 00:18:54,458
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw George Carlin last night, and he was freaking awesome, but all he did was talk about suicide and natural disasters, and how it's cool to watch people die.

187
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:57,459
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, okay, but he was really funny.

188
00:18:58,019 --> 00:19:11,346
[SPEAKER_07]: But the thing that kind of got me is that he was learning his new material for the 13th HBO special coming up, and he kept reading off paper the whole time.

189
00:19:11,386 --> 00:19:15,969
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, that's kind of unprofessional, but hey, he's been doing it for, what, 50 years?

190
00:19:16,618 --> 00:19:17,559
[SPEAKER_07]: He's entitled, I guess.

191
00:19:22,301 --> 00:19:30,646
[SPEAKER_07]: I also, you know, we went to the nice places to eat at the Silver Legacy in Reno.

192
00:19:31,487 --> 00:19:33,848
[SPEAKER_07]: And every freaking thing I ate made me sick.

193
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:36,029
[SPEAKER_07]: So I've decided I'm never eating again.

194
00:19:37,991 --> 00:19:39,451
[SPEAKER_25]: But you were chomping on nuts earlier.

195
00:19:40,132 --> 00:19:40,772
[SPEAKER_07]: Nuts don't count.

196
00:19:41,413 --> 00:19:42,213
[SPEAKER_07]: I like to eat nuts.

197
00:19:43,414 --> 00:19:43,734
[SPEAKER_23]: I bet.

198
00:19:44,771 --> 00:20:13,833
[SPEAKER_07]: um but no my ways of combating it are basically I'm gonna be fasting for the next three days like eating when I really have to um and uh drinking like this tea that's supposed to every and I think it's just because I think that I've got like a toxic buildup or something and last time I did that I ate a lot of garlic and drank this tea and drank a lot of water and it cleared cleared everything up so hopefully I uh

199
00:20:14,298 --> 00:20:16,379
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't have any nasty blood poisoning or anything.

200
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,200
[SPEAKER_25]: Hope not.

201
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:21,681
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, that can be kind of dangerous, but just take care of yourself.

202
00:20:22,742 --> 00:20:24,482
[SPEAKER_25]: As I said earlier, you might want to consult a doctor.

203
00:20:24,943 --> 00:20:26,743
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm tired of going to the doctor.

204
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:28,284
[SPEAKER_07]: My butt's finally healed.

205
00:20:28,864 --> 00:20:29,605
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, my hip.

206
00:20:30,765 --> 00:20:31,145
[SPEAKER_07]: Mostly.

207
00:20:32,146 --> 00:20:33,646
[SPEAKER_25]: Sounded a little foul there for a minute.

208
00:20:34,447 --> 00:20:35,087
[SPEAKER_25]: You know what?

209
00:20:35,247 --> 00:20:35,527
[SPEAKER_25]: What?

210
00:20:36,007 --> 00:20:37,048
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm going to throw this fair to you.

211
00:20:37,068 --> 00:20:37,708
[SPEAKER_25]: Jamie's butt?

212
00:20:40,609 --> 00:20:41,070
[SPEAKER_25]: Rob?

213
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:41,450
[SPEAKER_25]: What?

214
00:20:43,837 --> 00:20:44,558
[SPEAKER_25]: I got the finger.

215
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,681
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright, anything else you want to share?

216
00:20:50,122 --> 00:20:50,262
[SPEAKER_25]: No?

217
00:20:50,502 --> 00:20:51,463
[SPEAKER_25]: Loki, how was your week?

218
00:20:51,483 --> 00:20:53,705
[SPEAKER_25]: How was your day?

219
00:20:53,765 --> 00:20:54,205
[SPEAKER_25]: It was good.

220
00:20:54,726 --> 00:20:57,768
[SPEAKER_25]: I've been working, doing the work stuff.

221
00:20:58,929 --> 00:21:01,211
[SPEAKER_25]: And... I don't know.

222
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:06,415
[SPEAKER_25]: I've just been kind of... We went and met with another rabbi yesterday and found one.

223
00:21:07,216 --> 00:21:07,856
[SPEAKER_25]: And guess what?

224
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:09,538
[SPEAKER_25]: He's an ex-pro wrestler.

225
00:21:11,499 --> 00:21:12,400
[SPEAKER_07]: What did he wrestle as?

226
00:21:13,505 --> 00:21:40,116
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know, but it was a long time ago, like, you know, back in the day, you know, back when professional wrestling was just coming about, not like, you know, WWE type stuff, but like, you know, back, you know, where spandex suits, you know, that type of thing, anyways, so, um, yeah, ex-pro wrestler, that was kind of cool, and, um, then what else, oh, just been, um, I don't know, sticking around the house and stuff,

227
00:21:40,695 --> 00:21:49,942
[SPEAKER_25]: Playing with my PSP and doing things with the PSP that... Playing with the PSP and doing things with the PSP?

228
00:21:50,143 --> 00:21:53,285
[SPEAKER_25]: They're borderline illegal, you know, that type of thing.

229
00:21:55,707 --> 00:21:56,147
[SPEAKER_25]: I see.

230
00:21:56,688 --> 00:22:01,532
[SPEAKER_25]: I have, right now, I have games on my PSP and stuff.

231
00:22:01,752 --> 00:22:02,953
[SPEAKER_25]: And a lot of fun stuff like that.

232
00:22:03,313 --> 00:22:05,915
[SPEAKER_25]: And then I've been playing games on my PlayStation 2.

233
00:22:06,316 --> 00:22:07,677
[SPEAKER_25]: Like, I picked up...

234
00:22:08,462 --> 00:22:10,583
[SPEAKER_25]: Killer7, and that's sweet.

235
00:22:10,784 --> 00:22:11,264
[SPEAKER_25]: How is that?

236
00:22:11,304 --> 00:22:14,346
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, I guess you can talk about it later on the podcast, but give me a brief rundown.

237
00:22:14,386 --> 00:22:14,766
[SPEAKER_25]: How is that?

238
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:15,767
[SPEAKER_25]: It's psychotic.

239
00:22:16,367 --> 00:22:17,468
[SPEAKER_25]: That's the best way to describe it.

240
00:22:18,009 --> 00:22:19,149
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm really curious about that game.

241
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:20,270
[SPEAKER_25]: I want to pick that one up.

242
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:20,810
[SPEAKER_25]: It plays well.

243
00:22:20,971 --> 00:22:26,915
[SPEAKER_25]: Everyone's griping about the control scheme on it, but it reminds me of, like, almost like Alone in the Dark, in a sense.

244
00:22:27,615 --> 00:22:33,159
[SPEAKER_25]: But it's very, very psychotic, and I've only been playing it for, like, I'm only in the second level, and...

245
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:38,633
[SPEAKER_25]: It makes little sense, but you sort of get what the story's going on.

246
00:22:39,113 --> 00:22:52,862
[SPEAKER_25]: Apparently, well, I can't really spoil anything, but based on some of the notes that you get and stuff, it makes you feel like that you yourself are another one of his personalities, the character that you're playing, who has seven different personalities.

247
00:22:53,562 --> 00:22:57,885
[SPEAKER_25]: And it's just psychotic, and there's a bunch of people that you talk to.

248
00:22:58,305 --> 00:23:01,547
[SPEAKER_25]: It reminds me also of kind of like a Japanese anime movie or something, because...

249
00:23:02,108 --> 00:23:04,709
[SPEAKER_25]: There's this severed head that you talk to now and then.

250
00:23:04,749 --> 00:23:08,391
[SPEAKER_25]: Then there's this guy that helps you who's on some string, looks like a corpse.

251
00:23:08,711 --> 00:23:10,552
[SPEAKER_25]: There's some other dead guy that you talk to.

252
00:23:10,572 --> 00:23:11,893
[SPEAKER_25]: A bunch of weird shit like that.

253
00:23:12,193 --> 00:23:14,214
[SPEAKER_25]: And it's just psychotic.

254
00:23:14,254 --> 00:23:15,274
[SPEAKER_25]: Just go play it.

255
00:23:15,294 --> 00:23:15,654
[SPEAKER_25]: It's fun.

256
00:23:16,495 --> 00:23:17,755
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright, I'm curious about this game.

257
00:23:17,775 --> 00:23:19,776
[SPEAKER_25]: There's not a whole lot of games that have come out lately.

258
00:23:20,397 --> 00:23:23,438
[SPEAKER_25]: I found myself very challenged this week trying to find something new.

259
00:23:23,478 --> 00:23:27,460
[SPEAKER_25]: Because I try to play at least one new game every week for the podcast.

260
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,861
[SPEAKER_25]: So I have something new to talk about.

261
00:23:28,981 --> 00:23:29,141
[SPEAKER_25]: But...

262
00:23:30,151 --> 00:23:35,673
[SPEAKER_25]: There really wasn't a whole lot new for me to get this week, so I had to go get something I would never usually play.

263
00:23:35,693 --> 00:23:38,394
[SPEAKER_25]: I'll get to that later, though.

264
00:23:38,895 --> 00:23:42,296
[SPEAKER_25]: Anything else you want to share about your week today?

265
00:23:42,316 --> 00:23:43,596
[SPEAKER_25]: I've been playing a lot of PSP games.

266
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:45,117
[SPEAKER_25]: I've got follow-up questions for you, though.

267
00:23:45,137 --> 00:23:46,618
[SPEAKER_25]: What happened after last week's show?

268
00:23:46,658 --> 00:23:47,218
[SPEAKER_25]: I've got to know.

269
00:23:47,298 --> 00:23:48,678
[SPEAKER_25]: Your family was listening.

270
00:23:49,319 --> 00:23:50,239
[SPEAKER_25]: How was the next day?

271
00:23:50,299 --> 00:23:51,540
[SPEAKER_25]: How was the 4th of July for you?

272
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,520
[SPEAKER_25]: It was fine.

273
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,221
[SPEAKER_25]: They didn't really bring it up.

274
00:23:54,301 --> 00:23:55,641
[SPEAKER_25]: It was kind of just funny.

275
00:23:56,321 --> 00:23:56,922
[SPEAKER_25]: You know, and...

276
00:23:58,499 --> 00:23:59,660
[SPEAKER_25]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

277
00:24:28,069 --> 00:24:32,032
[SPEAKER_25]: So for example, in the beginning of the show, I'm like, oh yeah, I'm down four shots.

278
00:24:32,132 --> 00:24:33,513
[SPEAKER_25]: I was actually down eight shots.

279
00:24:33,673 --> 00:24:41,619
[SPEAKER_25]: And so by the end of the night, I think I was down 16 shots within about an hour, which is probably why I got sick.

280
00:24:42,359 --> 00:24:45,382
[SPEAKER_25]: Or 16 or more shots, because I was gone.

281
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:48,284
[SPEAKER_25]: And to the point where actually I don't remember parts of the night, so...

282
00:24:49,761 --> 00:24:50,622
[SPEAKER_25]: I remember most of it.

283
00:24:50,682 --> 00:24:52,083
[SPEAKER_25]: It's just a lot of it's really fuzzy.

284
00:24:52,303 --> 00:24:55,606
[SPEAKER_25]: Do you remember just kind of sitting here chilling and then all of a sudden... Yes!

285
00:24:56,787 --> 00:24:57,567
[SPEAKER_25]: I remember that.

286
00:24:58,188 --> 00:24:59,949
[SPEAKER_25]: We just got the stains cleaned up today.

287
00:25:00,489 --> 00:25:01,050
[SPEAKER_25]: It's exciting.

288
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:02,551
[SPEAKER_25]: I remember that.

289
00:25:03,578 --> 00:25:04,499
[SPEAKER_25]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

290
00:25:31,946 --> 00:25:35,729
[SPEAKER_25]: When the bottle's halfway gone, that's a good clue to stop drinking.

291
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:39,192
[SPEAKER_25]: The bottle was pretty much gone by the time I was done.

292
00:25:41,274 --> 00:25:48,400
[SPEAKER_25]: So, yeah, but, you know, you should have stopped about halfway, and then you wouldn't have had the, you know, blech episode.

293
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:52,123
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, I know from now on, and knowing is half the battle.

294
00:25:52,863 --> 00:25:55,565
[SPEAKER_23]: The more you know, G.I.

295
00:25:55,605 --> 00:25:56,026
[SPEAKER_23]: Joe.

296
00:25:59,589 --> 00:25:59,849
[SPEAKER_25]: All right.

297
00:26:00,858 --> 00:26:02,138
[SPEAKER_25]: So yeah, that's pretty much it.

298
00:26:02,199 --> 00:26:03,679
[SPEAKER_25]: I was surprised I didn't have a hangover.

299
00:26:04,839 --> 00:26:06,480
[SPEAKER_25]: Apparently I drank a lot of water here.

300
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:07,680
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't remember any of that.

301
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:08,380
[SPEAKER_25]: You did.

302
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,461
[SPEAKER_25]: You drank a lot of water.

303
00:26:09,761 --> 00:26:10,741
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't remember any of that.

304
00:26:11,141 --> 00:26:12,742
[SPEAKER_25]: We had to buy a new Brita filter because of you.

305
00:26:13,002 --> 00:26:13,362
[SPEAKER_25]: No, I'm kidding.

306
00:26:14,442 --> 00:26:17,783
[SPEAKER_25]: Honestly, I don't remember any of the drinking of water or pictures or whatever.

307
00:26:18,303 --> 00:26:19,944
[SPEAKER_25]: But I guess I did, so yeah.

308
00:26:21,524 --> 00:26:21,784
[SPEAKER_25]: Alrighty.

309
00:26:23,085 --> 00:26:23,465
[SPEAKER_25]: Anything else?

310
00:26:24,895 --> 00:26:30,917
[SPEAKER_25]: The entire podcast, like I stated on the podcast, I did not remember any of the podcast, so I had to listen to it.

311
00:26:30,977 --> 00:26:32,257
[SPEAKER_25]: And what did you think when you were listening to it?

312
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:37,939
[SPEAKER_25]: I thought it was interesting because I'd say the same thing like three times in a row in all one run-on sentence.

313
00:26:38,119 --> 00:26:42,240
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, which made last week's podcast our longest podcast to date, thank you very much.

314
00:26:44,521 --> 00:26:48,102
[SPEAKER_25]: It's like, you know, that game completely sucks.

315
00:26:48,742 --> 00:26:51,043
[SPEAKER_25]: I gotta tell you, that game completely sucks.

316
00:26:51,937 --> 00:26:53,859
[SPEAKER_25]: And that game completely sucked.

317
00:26:53,879 --> 00:26:54,299
[SPEAKER_25]: You know what?

318
00:26:54,359 --> 00:26:56,461
[SPEAKER_25]: That's half the other video game podcasts out there, though.

319
00:26:56,521 --> 00:26:58,843
[SPEAKER_25]: Honestly, if you listen to their reviews.

320
00:26:59,464 --> 00:27:02,006
[SPEAKER_25]: Not to knock on the other podcasts, but... But I am.

321
00:27:03,287 --> 00:27:03,647
[SPEAKER_25]: But I am.

322
00:27:03,807 --> 00:27:04,208
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm sorry.

323
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:07,430
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright.

324
00:27:08,791 --> 00:27:08,912
[SPEAKER_25]: What?

325
00:27:10,473 --> 00:27:10,693
[SPEAKER_25]: What?

326
00:27:11,093 --> 00:27:12,034
[SPEAKER_25]: You were going to say something?

327
00:27:12,575 --> 00:27:12,955
[SPEAKER_25]: Come on.

328
00:27:13,235 --> 00:27:13,556
[SPEAKER_25]: Out with it.

329
00:27:13,596 --> 00:27:14,757
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to be nice today.

330
00:27:14,977 --> 00:27:15,497
[SPEAKER_25]: Please.

331
00:27:15,857 --> 00:27:16,778
[SPEAKER_25]: Please be mean.

332
00:27:16,818 --> 00:27:17,199
[SPEAKER_25]: Be vicious.

333
00:27:18,482 --> 00:27:19,983
[SPEAKER_25]: You are a lame-ass drunk.

334
00:27:48,916 --> 00:27:50,417
[SPEAKER_06]: BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD

335
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:14,823
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't cancelled my account for Final Fantasy XI or anything.

336
00:28:31,969 --> 00:28:36,292
[SPEAKER_06]: I can go back to that when I find the disc and install them and stuff.

337
00:28:36,513 --> 00:28:38,174
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you want your World of Warcraft disc back, by the way?

338
00:28:38,274 --> 00:28:38,694
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's okay.

339
00:28:39,055 --> 00:28:40,115
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll fix that later, too.

340
00:28:41,937 --> 00:28:45,860
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm also going to plan on picking up Guild Wars this week, too, so yay.

341
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:52,585
[SPEAKER_25]: Guild Wars was fun for me for like a week, and then, I don't know, I just kind of, I didn't get it.

342
00:28:52,685 --> 00:28:53,906
[SPEAKER_25]: I thought it was too much.

343
00:28:54,367 --> 00:28:54,627
[SPEAKER_25]: Like, whoa.

344
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:58,351
[SPEAKER_25]: That mic is screwy, we're going to have to replace it.

345
00:28:58,791 --> 00:29:03,235
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw Guild Wars in action, and I thought it was okay.

346
00:29:03,395 --> 00:29:06,477
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't care for the animation style in it.

347
00:29:06,797 --> 00:29:13,322
[SPEAKER_25]: There's things I really like about Guild Wars, and that is no monthly fee, it's a very pretty looking game, and I like the...

348
00:29:15,484 --> 00:29:18,245
[SPEAKER_25]: Like, player versus player elements are actually really fun.

349
00:29:18,365 --> 00:29:20,245
[SPEAKER_25]: So, it's not a bad game.

350
00:29:20,305 --> 00:29:25,446
[SPEAKER_25]: I just, for some reason, I could not immerse myself in that the way I could Final Fantasy.

351
00:29:25,806 --> 00:29:26,806
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a PSO.

352
00:29:27,287 --> 00:29:28,267
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm fine with PSO.

353
00:29:30,047 --> 00:29:30,487
[SPEAKER_07]: Alrighty.

354
00:29:31,107 --> 00:29:36,108
[SPEAKER_06]: And I got some DS games this week that I will probably touch on a little bit later.

355
00:29:36,348 --> 00:29:36,608
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

356
00:29:36,769 --> 00:29:38,249
[SPEAKER_06]: Assuming we get to play it.

357
00:29:39,449 --> 00:29:40,489
[SPEAKER_06]: But, uh, Meteos.

358
00:29:41,469 --> 00:29:43,890
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, I got to watch a bunch of, like,

359
00:29:45,457 --> 00:29:46,938
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, stuff that's been around for a while.

360
00:29:47,078 --> 00:29:53,561
[SPEAKER_06]: We had a trial of EverQuest 2, and so Andrew was trying that out, and I was watching that for a little bit.

361
00:29:54,421 --> 00:29:59,704
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just, you know, I've been in the game scene, but out of the game scene at the same time, if that makes sense.

362
00:29:59,924 --> 00:30:06,027
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know if I should admit this, but I've actually been really curious about EverQuest 2, and I kind of want to try it out.

363
00:30:06,407 --> 00:30:08,808
[SPEAKER_06]: I think PC Gamer has like a child disc or something anyway.

364
00:30:10,846 --> 00:30:12,887
[SPEAKER_25]: What, do you want to be fat and lazy?

365
00:30:12,947 --> 00:30:14,748
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, come on.

366
00:30:14,808 --> 00:30:15,308
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no.

367
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:28,753
[SPEAKER_06]: The funny thing about Andrew trying the 30-day trial, or whatever, the little trial disk was, as soon as he logged in, he looks at me with this, you know, Andrew look, and he's like, hmm, slash pizza?

368
00:30:28,773 --> 00:30:29,734
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, shut up!

369
00:30:30,154 --> 00:30:30,734
[SPEAKER_06]: It was funny.

370
00:30:31,274 --> 00:30:31,915
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, God.

371
00:30:33,129 --> 00:30:34,510
[SPEAKER_25]: Is that slash pizza thing for real?

372
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:35,390
[SPEAKER_06]: I think so.

373
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:36,851
[SPEAKER_06]: We didn't try it, though.

374
00:30:37,251 --> 00:30:40,232
[SPEAKER_25]: I was kind of hoping it was this big urban legend online or something.

375
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:41,493
[SPEAKER_25]: No luck.

376
00:30:42,693 --> 00:30:43,894
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright, my week and my day.

377
00:30:43,954 --> 00:30:44,774
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, I'm sorry, is that it?

378
00:30:44,914 --> 00:30:45,855
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, that's it, pretty much.

379
00:30:46,664 --> 00:30:48,005
[SPEAKER_25]: My week and my day, it was okay.

380
00:30:48,065 --> 00:30:59,114
[SPEAKER_25]: You know what, since I didn't really have the car to drive around in me, I had a car, but I couldn't really take it anywhere because it was not safe to leave in a parking lot with no window, besides my work parking lot because they have cameras there.

381
00:30:59,935 --> 00:31:01,056
[SPEAKER_25]: I really didn't do an awful lot.

382
00:31:01,076 --> 00:31:04,318
[SPEAKER_25]: I just kind of sat on my big butt and, you know... Sniff.

383
00:31:04,959 --> 00:31:10,203
[SPEAKER_25]: No, actually, a couple of my friends took me places, so I was able to get out of the house at least like once in a while, which is good.

384
00:31:10,223 --> 00:31:10,924
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay.

385
00:31:11,576 --> 00:31:12,116
[SPEAKER_25]: Google Earth Keyhole

386
00:31:37,136 --> 00:31:38,317
[SPEAKER_25]: And now they're giving it away for free.

387
00:31:38,337 --> 00:31:45,764
[SPEAKER_25]: And basically what it is, it's very similar to Google Maps, how you have the satellite views on Google Maps and it's fun to like try and find your house and stuff.

388
00:31:45,845 --> 00:31:49,148
[SPEAKER_25]: But imagine that, but like the size of the world.

389
00:31:49,488 --> 00:31:55,674
[SPEAKER_25]: Like I was traveling to Tokyo and I was looking at the maps of Tokyo and I was looking at Moscow and like all these crazy places, right?

390
00:31:56,114 --> 00:32:00,559
[SPEAKER_25]: It's a way to like travel the world without leaving your chair.

391
00:32:01,144 --> 00:32:02,985
[SPEAKER_25]: which I'm sure would be a great marketing slogan for them.

392
00:32:03,005 --> 00:32:07,607
[SPEAKER_25]: But I find myself fascinated just looking at different places.

393
00:32:07,647 --> 00:32:10,468
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm like, I wonder what the border to Mexico looks like because I've never been there.

394
00:32:10,788 --> 00:32:13,349
[SPEAKER_25]: And I'll look along the Mexican border and see if I can see any people.

395
00:32:13,369 --> 00:32:14,350
[SPEAKER_25]: No, I'm kidding.

396
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:15,991
[SPEAKER_25]: The White House is pixeled out.

397
00:32:16,211 --> 00:32:19,492
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, the White House is pixelated out which I think is very interesting.

398
00:32:20,372 --> 00:32:23,434
[SPEAKER_25]: But it's also that way if I remember right on Google Satellite Maps too.

399
00:32:23,954 --> 00:32:26,236
[SPEAKER_25]: because they don't want bad people to find it.

400
00:32:26,436 --> 00:32:33,202
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, to add to that, the second search Andrew did, he was like, hmm, let's see if I can do troop movements.

401
00:32:33,262 --> 00:32:34,303
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, shut up.

402
00:32:36,451 --> 00:32:38,733
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

403
00:32:58,611 --> 00:33:00,674
[SPEAKER_25]: And I looked at it, and I couldn't tell.

404
00:33:00,794 --> 00:33:07,921
[SPEAKER_25]: It's either a business complex or it's duplexes type thing.

405
00:33:08,142 --> 00:33:08,502
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know.

406
00:33:09,203 --> 00:33:11,686
[SPEAKER_25]: I know that sounds very stalkerish, but I'm very curious.

407
00:33:11,886 --> 00:33:19,254
[SPEAKER_25]: As somebody who is part of a startup business ourselves with Orange Lounge Radio and kind of running it out of our apartments...

408
00:33:20,094 --> 00:33:25,438
[SPEAKER_25]: Our address, though, I can't say the address where we live over the air, but it sounds very corporate.

409
00:33:25,518 --> 00:33:28,301
[SPEAKER_25]: Like the name of the street sounds like a street that would be downtown.

410
00:33:28,721 --> 00:33:29,502
[SPEAKER_25]: We have an apartment number.

411
00:33:29,522 --> 00:33:33,385
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think when people hear it... Well, it's also considering the location of what else is nearby.

412
00:33:33,405 --> 00:33:34,286
[SPEAKER_25]: True, very true.

413
00:33:34,626 --> 00:33:38,289
[SPEAKER_25]: I actually live in a very commercial district part of town, so very interesting.

414
00:33:38,549 --> 00:33:45,254
[SPEAKER_25]: So people might assume, like when they see it on the business card, like, oh, they're in a nice office, not out of some schmo's apartment.

415
00:33:45,274 --> 00:33:49,578
[SPEAKER_25]: So I was just really curious if that thing was being run out of somebody's apartment or duplex or if it was...

416
00:33:50,373 --> 00:33:51,374
[SPEAKER_25]: A legit office.

417
00:33:52,255 --> 00:33:52,595
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know.

418
00:33:52,635 --> 00:33:53,196
[SPEAKER_25]: Am I crazy?

419
00:33:54,757 --> 00:33:55,077
[SPEAKER_06]: Always.

420
00:33:55,718 --> 00:33:56,338
[SPEAKER_06]: Always crazy.

421
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:57,960
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh!

422
00:33:58,901 --> 00:34:01,463
[SPEAKER_25]: Our chatroom says it is an actual office building.

423
00:34:03,144 --> 00:34:04,145
[SPEAKER_25]: Sakurina says that.

424
00:34:04,306 --> 00:34:06,087
[SPEAKER_25]: And there's pictures of it on popnco.com.

425
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:09,290
[SPEAKER_25]: See, I should have just done the research and followed the links the old-fashioned way.

426
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:10,171
[SPEAKER_14]: That's not fun!

427
00:34:10,291 --> 00:34:13,794
[SPEAKER_25]: I had to Google Earth it because Google Earth is the new orange.

428
00:34:14,134 --> 00:34:14,435
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know.

429
00:34:15,586 --> 00:34:16,466
[SPEAKER_25]: Google Earth is awesome.

430
00:34:16,726 --> 00:34:17,386
[SPEAKER_25]: Here's the thing, though.

431
00:34:17,406 --> 00:34:22,168
[SPEAKER_25]: You can't get it right now from Google's website because they said too many people have tried to download it.

432
00:34:22,448 --> 00:34:23,148
[SPEAKER_25]: But here's the trick.

433
00:34:23,348 --> 00:34:27,509
[SPEAKER_25]: Go to download.com and do a search for Google Earth and you can get it that way still.

434
00:34:27,909 --> 00:34:28,509
[SPEAKER_25]: Ha ha ha.

435
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:29,769
[SPEAKER_25]: Fooled you, Google people.

436
00:34:30,149 --> 00:34:30,849
[SPEAKER_25]: It's so much fun.

437
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:33,210
[SPEAKER_25]: I can't explain why it's so great.

438
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:38,231
[SPEAKER_25]: It's so fun to just look at different areas and look at places I've traveled to and airports.

439
00:34:39,091 --> 00:34:39,411
[SPEAKER_25]: It's fun.

440
00:34:39,812 --> 00:34:41,692
[SPEAKER_25]: But warning, if you live in a rural area...

441
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:43,931
[SPEAKER_25]: Your satellite pictures probably aren't very good.

442
00:34:44,271 --> 00:34:48,933
[SPEAKER_25]: If you don't live within like 50 miles of a major city, it probably is just a big blur, what your house looks like.

443
00:34:52,214 --> 00:34:59,177
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright, there was that, and I have to give a shout out to this, because it's kind of DDR related.

444
00:34:59,297 --> 00:35:03,219
[SPEAKER_25]: It's a game that's really, really popular over on the DDR Freak forums.

445
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:06,200
[SPEAKER_25]: It's this game they play in random chat called The Wolf Game.

446
00:35:06,421 --> 00:35:07,161
[SPEAKER_25]: Have you guys ever seen this?

447
00:35:07,999 --> 00:35:08,340
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yes.

448
00:35:17,419 --> 00:35:18,480
[SPEAKER_25]: The Salem Witch Trials.

449
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,462
[SPEAKER_25]: I really don't know how to explain it.

450
00:35:20,522 --> 00:35:31,210
[SPEAKER_25]: It's a forum game, and it's kind of like you're trying to fool people into thinking you're human, but three or four players, depending on the game rules, are assigned to be a wolf, and they're slowly killing off the other players.

451
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:34,092
[SPEAKER_25]: And then everybody else gets to lynch one person.

452
00:35:34,152 --> 00:35:34,833
[SPEAKER_25]: It's kind of crazy.

453
00:35:36,034 --> 00:35:40,837
[SPEAKER_25]: Go to DDRFreeGranumChat, look for any thread that starts with TWG, and they've got rules posted.

454
00:35:41,158 --> 00:35:43,720
[SPEAKER_25]: I played my first game, and I lost!

455
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:45,450
[SPEAKER_25]: I lost!

456
00:35:46,231 --> 00:35:47,592
[SPEAKER_25]: I can talk about it now.

457
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:51,774
[SPEAKER_25]: I did not get lynched, I was a wolf, and I got hit by the Vigilante.

458
00:35:52,455 --> 00:35:54,236
[SPEAKER_25]: There was an auxiliary role in the game.

459
00:35:54,276 --> 00:35:55,637
[SPEAKER_07]: But the Vigilante's a new thing.

460
00:35:56,217 --> 00:36:10,426
[SPEAKER_25]: It's kind of like, I don't think it existed in the first few games, but the Vigilante basically is a human that can take out any player at any time, and I got wasted, and I was so pissed off, because I didn't even remember that the game had one of those, but, you know, hats off to the guy that did it, because basically he won it.

461
00:36:10,686 --> 00:36:13,908
[SPEAKER_25]: See, he single-handedly won the game for the human team, so hats off to that guy.

462
00:36:14,268 --> 00:36:14,428
[SPEAKER_25]: So...

463
00:36:16,722 --> 00:36:17,342
[SPEAKER_25]: It's a fun game.

464
00:36:17,663 --> 00:36:19,243
[SPEAKER_25]: I endorse that forum game.

465
00:36:19,483 --> 00:36:21,904
[SPEAKER_25]: Although it took me like 36 games to finally jump in it.

466
00:36:21,924 --> 00:36:22,624
[SPEAKER_25]: I thought it was fun.

467
00:36:24,624 --> 00:36:24,885
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know.

468
00:36:24,905 --> 00:36:27,985
[SPEAKER_25]: I just wanted to give a shout out to that because I like cute little forum games like that.

469
00:36:31,506 --> 00:36:34,247
[SPEAKER_25]: Anyway, let's see.

470
00:36:34,407 --> 00:36:35,027
[SPEAKER_25]: What else is there?

471
00:36:35,127 --> 00:36:35,547
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, I know.

472
00:36:35,607 --> 00:36:37,848
[SPEAKER_25]: Let's have Orange Launch Radio movie time.

473
00:36:37,888 --> 00:36:38,388
[SPEAKER_25]: How's that sound?

474
00:36:38,708 --> 00:36:40,069
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay!

475
00:36:40,909 --> 00:36:44,650
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm bitter about movies right now because nobody will go see Land of the Dead with me.

476
00:36:45,567 --> 00:36:46,308
[SPEAKER_25]: Aw, I'm sorry.

477
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:48,531
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sad.

478
00:36:48,771 --> 00:36:51,995
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, I want to respond to some comments in the chat room there.

479
00:36:52,416 --> 00:36:55,119
[SPEAKER_25]: OrangeLoungeRadio.com, click on chat.

480
00:36:55,419 --> 00:37:02,528
[SPEAKER_25]: And if OrangeLoungeRadio.com is not working for you right now, some people are timing out when they hit it, you can view our chat room the old-fashioned way.

481
00:37:02,568 --> 00:37:04,831
[SPEAKER_25]: You just have to connect to an other side.

482
00:37:05,695 --> 00:37:06,635
[SPEAKER_25]: IRC server.

483
00:37:07,295 --> 00:37:10,236
[SPEAKER_25]: A good one would be what's the one I'm on right now here?

484
00:37:10,316 --> 00:37:16,077
[SPEAKER_25]: It's irc.introversion.net if you have an IRC client and then join channel Orange Lounge.

485
00:37:16,577 --> 00:37:18,157
[SPEAKER_25]: So that's the way to do it.

486
00:37:19,317 --> 00:37:21,238
[SPEAKER_25]: But I did want to respond to some folks in the chat room there.

487
00:37:22,158 --> 00:37:25,698
[SPEAKER_25]: The Wolf game is an adapted version of another game called Mafia.

488
00:37:27,259 --> 00:37:29,439
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, I forgot to mention that.

489
00:37:29,459 --> 00:37:32,240
[SPEAKER_25]: So if you've played a game called Mafia, you've played a very similar game.

490
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,340
[SPEAKER_25]: Also, I think

491
00:37:35,427 --> 00:37:38,429
[SPEAKER_25]: This game started in live-action form.

492
00:37:38,469 --> 00:37:40,490
[SPEAKER_25]: Like, it's a popular live-action role-playing game.

493
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:40,970
[SPEAKER_25]: A LARP.

494
00:37:41,411 --> 00:37:43,272
[SPEAKER_25]: It's a fun one-night LARPer, I think.

495
00:37:43,372 --> 00:37:44,953
[SPEAKER_25]: So, something to think about there.

496
00:37:45,133 --> 00:37:46,894
[SPEAKER_25]: So you might be more familiar with this game than you think.

497
00:37:47,054 --> 00:37:48,635
[SPEAKER_25]: So, fun, fun, fun.

498
00:37:49,095 --> 00:37:49,755
[SPEAKER_25]: Good times.

499
00:37:49,775 --> 00:37:53,678
[SPEAKER_25]: Would that be that stupid game, Poison, where you're, like, shaking hands and stuff?

500
00:37:54,778 --> 00:37:55,039
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know.

501
00:37:55,059 --> 00:37:55,899
[SPEAKER_25]: I've never played Poison.

502
00:37:56,780 --> 00:38:04,144
[SPEAKER_25]: There's one person that's, like, the thief or whatever, and they're shaking hands, and after you shake hands with someone that's basically...

503
00:38:04,571 --> 00:38:05,612
[SPEAKER_25]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

504
00:38:33,942 --> 00:38:35,644
[SPEAKER_25]: You're on the right track.

505
00:38:35,724 --> 00:38:37,166
[SPEAKER_07]: Only LARP I ever did was Vampire.

506
00:38:38,407 --> 00:38:39,388
[SPEAKER_25]: I never played a LARP.

507
00:38:39,749 --> 00:38:42,472
[SPEAKER_25]: I played D&D in high school, like a couple times.

508
00:38:42,592 --> 00:38:45,916
[SPEAKER_25]: I wasn't like a total dork, but I had... Hey!

509
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:49,680
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm still doing tabletop gaming.

510
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,721
[SPEAKER_25]: There's not a problem with that.

511
00:38:50,801 --> 00:38:52,103
[SPEAKER_25]: Hey, dork pride, yo.

512
00:38:52,543 --> 00:38:53,585
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm playing Buffy.

513
00:38:55,021 --> 00:38:55,561
[SPEAKER_25]: Buffy TV?

514
00:38:55,581 --> 00:38:57,583
[SPEAKER_25]: Please, please, come on.

515
00:38:58,063 --> 00:39:01,226
[SPEAKER_25]: You have to admit, Buffy roleplay is a little bit dorky.

516
00:39:01,707 --> 00:39:02,407
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's fun.

517
00:39:02,828 --> 00:39:03,428
[SPEAKER_25]: That's fine.

518
00:39:03,508 --> 00:39:05,050
[SPEAKER_07]: It's done like a TV episode, it's great.

519
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:11,295
[SPEAKER_25]: As somebody who co-hosts an internet radio show dedicated to DDR, that's fine.

520
00:39:11,916 --> 00:39:13,177
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't make me go grudge on you.

521
00:39:22,782 --> 00:39:25,445
[SPEAKER_25]: Now I'm having a problem finding that video I wanted to show you guys.

522
00:39:25,485 --> 00:39:26,145
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm so upset.

523
00:39:27,106 --> 00:39:28,207
[SPEAKER_07]: What else is new, Rob?

524
00:39:28,528 --> 00:39:29,809
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking of... Oh, I found it.

525
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:34,914
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, so we love to do Orange Lounge Radio movie time because it's really funny because we're a radio show.

526
00:39:34,974 --> 00:39:35,735
[SPEAKER_25]: You guys can't see the movie.

527
00:39:35,975 --> 00:39:37,817
[SPEAKER_25]: But the audio on this will say it all.

528
00:39:38,137 --> 00:39:42,321
[SPEAKER_25]: So what we're going to look at is a download that's available on ebombsworld.com.

529
00:39:42,381 --> 00:39:43,442
[SPEAKER_25]: It's a very popular site.

530
00:39:43,722 --> 00:39:46,125
[SPEAKER_25]: It's a corporate training video for sexual harassment.

531
00:39:47,598 --> 00:39:49,600
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know if you guys have seen this, but it's fucking funny.

532
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,001
[SPEAKER_25]: I think I know who this is.

533
00:39:52,082 --> 00:39:55,024
[SPEAKER_25]: It's probably Dave Chappelle.

534
00:39:55,285 --> 00:40:00,309
[SPEAKER_01]: You hear about sexual harassment on TV, and it makes the headlines in newspapers.

535
00:40:01,009 --> 00:40:03,792
[SPEAKER_01]: As an employee, what do you need to know about it?

536
00:40:04,432 --> 00:40:07,735
[SPEAKER_01]: First, sexual harassment is against the law.

537
00:40:08,936 --> 00:40:10,817
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's against your company's policy.

538
00:40:11,578 --> 00:40:13,620
[SPEAKER_01]: So what is sexual harassment?

539
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,302
[SPEAKER_12]: Linda, you are doing a fine job here.

540
00:40:16,604 --> 00:40:17,705
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, well, thank you, Steve.

541
00:40:17,945 --> 00:40:20,347
[SPEAKER_12]: But, you know, you might try dressing a little sexier at work.

542
00:40:21,508 --> 00:40:22,009
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry?

543
00:40:22,089 --> 00:40:24,210
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, we're talking about your job here.

544
00:40:26,572 --> 00:40:28,274
[SPEAKER_25]: Angel, I want you to dress a little more sexier.

545
00:40:28,594 --> 00:40:30,115
[SPEAKER_25]: There may be physical harassment.

546
00:40:31,016 --> 00:40:31,336
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow.

547
00:40:32,657 --> 00:40:33,658
[SPEAKER_11]: You're really tense today, Nancy.

548
00:40:33,939 --> 00:40:34,079
[SPEAKER_05]: Ow!

549
00:40:34,379 --> 00:40:34,759
[SPEAKER_05]: Bill!

550
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:35,960
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry.

551
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:38,422
[SPEAKER_25]: Dude, Bill has no sense of hot.

552
00:40:38,823 --> 00:40:40,224
[SPEAKER_05]: I really don't like it when you do that.

553
00:40:40,284 --> 00:40:41,405
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you please stop?

554
00:40:42,145 --> 00:40:43,126
[SPEAKER_25]: Dude, Bill, that's a dude.

555
00:40:43,366 --> 00:40:43,947
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll never stop you.

556
00:40:45,689 --> 00:40:46,610
[SPEAKER_25]: I'd be decking him.

557
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:47,911
[SPEAKER_25]: Because she looks like she's going to cry.

558
00:40:49,131 --> 00:40:50,492
[SPEAKER_25]: Bill, that's a dude!

559
00:40:50,692 --> 00:40:52,053
[SPEAKER_00]: Verbal Christmas is great.

560
00:40:53,194 --> 00:40:55,055
[SPEAKER_17]: Word around the offices, you've got a fat cock.

561
00:40:56,116 --> 00:40:57,536
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, I do.

562
00:40:58,677 --> 00:40:59,718
[SPEAKER_17]: I've got a fat cock, too.

563
00:41:01,219 --> 00:41:03,160
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe we should rub our fat cocks together sometime.

564
00:41:04,381 --> 00:41:05,301
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe a little oil.

565
00:41:06,322 --> 00:41:07,142
[SPEAKER_17]: Two fat cocks.

566
00:41:07,863 --> 00:41:08,263
[SPEAKER_17]: Together.

567
00:41:09,504 --> 00:41:09,624
[SPEAKER_17]: Oil.

568
00:41:12,205 --> 00:41:17,146
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be visual harassment, such as derogatory posters, cartoons, or drawings.

569
00:41:18,527 --> 00:41:21,447
[SPEAKER_01]: Sexual harassment is not always about sex.

570
00:41:22,107 --> 00:41:25,748
[SPEAKER_01]: It may be the result of a power struggle between a manager and a subordinate.

571
00:41:27,209 --> 00:41:32,310
[SPEAKER_11]: Man, I could go for a power fuck right now.

572
00:41:33,870 --> 00:41:37,071
[SPEAKER_01]: Change is slow, and what was acceptable in time... Here's the best part.

573
00:41:37,091 --> 00:41:38,311
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the best part of the whole video.

574
00:41:38,512 --> 00:41:40,392
[SPEAKER_01]: ...can now be sexual harassment.

575
00:41:45,313 --> 00:41:50,216
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you talking about my vagina?

576
00:41:51,257 --> 00:41:51,677
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe.

577
00:41:53,098 --> 00:41:56,079
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone wants to be treated fairly and with respect.

578
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:57,881
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you talking about my vagina?

579
00:41:58,041 --> 00:42:00,722
[SPEAKER_01]: With the courtesy and respect that you want for yourself.

580
00:42:01,383 --> 00:42:04,824
[SPEAKER_01]: It's your company's policy and it's the law.

581
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:13,925
[SPEAKER_25]: E-bombsworld.com E-b-a-u-m-s-world.com Funniest damn thing I've seen all week, honestly.

582
00:42:13,945 --> 00:42:14,546
[SPEAKER_25]: That was great.

583
00:42:15,687 --> 00:42:16,087
[SPEAKER_25]: Seriously.

584
00:42:16,127 --> 00:42:17,108
[SPEAKER_25]: It's basically what they did.

585
00:42:17,128 --> 00:42:20,692
[SPEAKER_25]: I think they spliced a real video with those fake clips.

586
00:42:21,052 --> 00:42:21,352
[SPEAKER_25]: Funny.

587
00:42:21,512 --> 00:42:22,053
[SPEAKER_25]: Funny stuff.

588
00:42:22,133 --> 00:42:23,634
[SPEAKER_25]: Love it.

589
00:42:24,195 --> 00:42:25,716
[SPEAKER_25]: We're going to pass it around at work now.

590
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:31,161
[SPEAKER_25]: Are you talking about my vagina?

591
00:42:31,862 --> 00:42:32,262
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe.

592
00:42:34,454 --> 00:42:35,554
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Paul, if you're listening.

593
00:42:35,615 --> 00:42:36,655
[SPEAKER_25]: Paul's the one who sent that to me.

594
00:42:37,055 --> 00:42:37,715
[SPEAKER_25]: What a nice guy.

595
00:42:38,116 --> 00:42:38,896
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen that one.

596
00:42:39,316 --> 00:42:39,556
[SPEAKER_25]: All right.

597
00:42:39,976 --> 00:42:45,039
[SPEAKER_25]: For those of you guys that were good enough to sit through that Orange Lounge Radio movie time, I've got a special treat for you.

598
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:50,481
[SPEAKER_25]: We have a new song from We Love Katamari, the Japanese version.

599
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:54,322
[SPEAKER_25]: A buddy of mine picked it up and did a rip of the opening song.

600
00:42:54,342 --> 00:42:55,363
[SPEAKER_25]: So you want to hear what this sounds like?

601
00:42:55,543 --> 00:42:57,164
[SPEAKER_25]: One of the new songs from We Heart Katamari?

602
00:42:57,324 --> 00:42:57,564
[SPEAKER_25]: Please.

603
00:42:57,864 --> 00:42:58,264
[SPEAKER_25]: Here it is.

604
00:42:58,324 --> 00:42:59,044
[SPEAKER_25]: It's only a minute long.

605
00:42:59,064 --> 00:42:59,725
[SPEAKER_25]: It's the introduction.

606
00:42:59,745 --> 00:43:00,065
[SPEAKER_25]: Here it is.

607
00:43:26,884 --> 00:43:48,021
[SPEAKER_15]: Walkin' with the sunshine Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na Katamari on the swing Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na Katamari on the swing Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na Katamari on the swing Iba hajimaru yo Ibi to boku no Itaike

608
00:44:04,138 --> 00:44:06,800
[SPEAKER_25]: All right, that was from We Heart Katamari, the new game.

609
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:12,263
[SPEAKER_25]: It's good to know that the soundtrack is going to be faithful to the first one.

610
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:19,528
[SPEAKER_25]: Although it sounds like they're going to kind of recycle that theme over and over, but hopefully it's only... I heard that it wasn't as good as the first one, but that was one person's opinion.

611
00:44:19,768 --> 00:44:20,288
[SPEAKER_25]: You know what, though?

612
00:44:20,328 --> 00:44:21,970
[SPEAKER_25]: But how can you top the first one?

613
00:44:22,190 --> 00:44:22,710
[SPEAKER_25]: Seriously.

614
00:44:22,950 --> 00:44:23,390
[SPEAKER_25]: You can't.

615
00:44:23,651 --> 00:44:24,091
[SPEAKER_25]: You can't.

616
00:44:25,432 --> 00:44:27,073
[SPEAKER_25]: The sequels are never as good as the original.

617
00:44:27,193 --> 00:44:28,334
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, the game might.

618
00:44:28,434 --> 00:44:30,195
[SPEAKER_25]: Games are sometimes the exception to the rule there.

619
00:44:31,227 --> 00:44:32,828
[SPEAKER_25]: Anyway, let me play just a little clip.

620
00:44:32,848 --> 00:44:35,689
[SPEAKER_25]: This song is like six and a half minutes long, so I'm not going to subject you to this whole thing.

621
00:44:35,969 --> 00:44:36,830
[SPEAKER_25]: But you have to hear this.

622
00:44:36,890 --> 00:44:40,852
[SPEAKER_25]: This sounds like a guy that did a bunch of DDR songs.

623
00:44:40,912 --> 00:44:41,212
[SPEAKER_25]: It's not.

624
00:44:41,252 --> 00:44:42,012
[SPEAKER_25]: It's actually a different guy.

625
00:44:42,052 --> 00:44:47,355
[SPEAKER_25]: But this is a Japanese beatboxer guy, and this is the training music in We Heart Katamari.

626
00:44:47,375 --> 00:44:49,236
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm only going to play a little clip of this because it's very long.

627
00:44:49,516 --> 00:44:49,976
[SPEAKER_25]: But here it is.

628
00:44:51,617 --> 00:44:53,038
[SPEAKER_11]: We Heart Katamari

629
00:45:01,274 --> 00:45:02,035
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

630
00:45:19,534 --> 00:45:20,074
Thanks for watching!

631
00:45:37,586 --> 00:45:38,787
All right, you guys get the idea.

632
00:45:38,807 --> 00:45:39,348
I think that's funny.

633
00:45:39,368 --> 00:45:39,848
That's so cute.

634
00:45:39,908 --> 00:45:40,469
I need that.

635
00:45:40,489 --> 00:45:41,249
So that's the training.

636
00:45:41,269 --> 00:45:42,170
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll send it to you later.

637
00:45:42,190 --> 00:45:46,874
[SPEAKER_11]: For those of you guys, we have this poor guy in the chat room that's like, what is Katamari?

638
00:45:46,894 --> 00:45:47,875
[SPEAKER_11]: What the hell is this?

639
00:46:00,876 --> 00:46:06,417
[SPEAKER_25]: Very, um, it was kind of a, I guess you'd call it a sleeper hit on the PlayStation 2, Katamari Damacy.

640
00:46:06,797 --> 00:46:13,439
[SPEAKER_25]: Concept is, you're this little guy, and you have a big ball, and you roll it around, and your ball is sticky, and it just picks everything up.

641
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:22,881
[SPEAKER_25]: So you start out, and you're rolling over, like, gumdrops and thumbtacks, and then suddenly you're running over small animals, and, like, then you're running over people, and cars, and cities, and rainbows.

642
00:46:22,961 --> 00:46:23,521
[SPEAKER_25]: It's beautiful.

643
00:46:23,821 --> 00:46:24,361
[SPEAKER_25]: Beautiful game.

644
00:46:24,721 --> 00:46:28,202
[SPEAKER_25]: Um, you can't really call it, like, an underground hit now, because I think...

645
00:46:28,522 --> 00:46:30,322
[SPEAKER_25]: Tons of people found out about this game.

646
00:46:30,362 --> 00:46:31,443
[SPEAKER_25]: It's almost mainstream now.

647
00:46:32,283 --> 00:46:34,543
[SPEAKER_25]: I wanted to say, though, about that Japanese beatboxing.

648
00:46:34,623 --> 00:46:38,864
[SPEAKER_25]: It totally reminds me, that song there, of something from Bjork's latest album.

649
00:46:48,926 --> 00:46:50,426
[SPEAKER_25]: This is the whole Bjork album.

650
00:46:50,466 --> 00:46:53,006
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know, when I heard that, I was like, I don't know.

651
00:46:54,927 --> 00:46:55,227
[SPEAKER_25]: Forget it.

652
00:46:57,010 --> 00:46:59,511
[SPEAKER_07]: Just a word to our listeners.

653
00:46:59,531 --> 00:47:03,272
[SPEAKER_07]: I posted in the chat room the Japanese Katamari Damashii.

654
00:47:05,033 --> 00:47:08,234
[SPEAKER_07]: Mina Garaisuki Katamari Damashii is up.

655
00:47:09,834 --> 00:47:11,235
[SPEAKER_25]: And what does that translate to in English?

656
00:47:11,335 --> 00:47:12,755
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody loves Katamari.

657
00:47:14,676 --> 00:47:15,776
[SPEAKER_23]: Beautiful game, beautiful game.

658
00:47:16,936 --> 00:47:17,237
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright.

659
00:47:19,099 --> 00:47:20,220
[SPEAKER_25]: So we'll be looking at that.

660
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:20,880
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, I love this.

661
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:23,882
[SPEAKER_25]: Our chat room is going, I have a fat Katamari.

662
00:47:23,922 --> 00:47:26,183
[SPEAKER_25]: We should rub our Katamaris together sometime.

663
00:47:27,323 --> 00:47:29,124
[SPEAKER_25]: It smells like Katamari in here.

664
00:47:30,165 --> 00:47:31,806
[SPEAKER_25]: Is that your Katamari?

665
00:47:32,186 --> 00:47:32,806
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.

666
00:47:34,868 --> 00:47:36,708
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, chat room, you're so funny.

667
00:47:37,409 --> 00:47:38,169
[SPEAKER_25]: You're so funny.

668
00:47:38,409 --> 00:47:39,190
[SPEAKER_25]: Me laugh long time.

669
00:47:39,210 --> 00:47:41,211
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I actually like the, it's the flashlight.

670
00:47:41,291 --> 00:47:42,051
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of cute.

671
00:47:44,753 --> 00:47:45,173
[SPEAKER_23]: All right.

672
00:47:45,693 --> 00:47:46,574
[SPEAKER_07]: Information.

673
00:47:46,674 --> 00:47:46,754
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh.

674
00:47:47,449 --> 00:47:51,293
[SPEAKER_25]: It's about time we start talking about that four panel dancing game.

675
00:47:51,313 --> 00:47:52,374
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright, you want to get into the news?

676
00:47:52,975 --> 00:47:53,856
[SPEAKER_25]: Fine, we'll get into the news.

677
00:47:56,439 --> 00:47:59,362
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright, so, if you haven't heard yet...

678
00:48:00,854 --> 00:48:04,818
[SPEAKER_25]: You might remember when we were talking about this on the show a few weeks ago, because it was huge news.

679
00:48:05,279 --> 00:48:11,725
[SPEAKER_25]: And that was when Konami first filed the suit against... I keep wanting to say Animero, but that's not true.

680
00:48:11,785 --> 00:48:14,808
[SPEAKER_25]: It's Rocksword Games against Indigroove.

681
00:48:15,389 --> 00:48:23,858
[SPEAKER_25]: And most people were saying that it has to do with the fact that what the Boxsword, the system that runs Indigroove, does is it kind of...

682
00:48:24,446 --> 00:48:26,767
[SPEAKER_25]: Stowe's away in a regular DDR machine.

683
00:48:26,947 --> 00:48:38,251
[SPEAKER_25]: And Konami was saying that this was infringing on their trademarks and their patents because people would apply the In The Groove stickers, but they'd do a sloppy job of it, so you would still see distinctive parts of a DDR machine underneath.

684
00:48:38,771 --> 00:48:44,773
[SPEAKER_25]: And it's ruining DDR because In The Groove, according to the lawsuit, you may feel differently, is a subpar game.

685
00:48:45,533 --> 00:48:47,314
[SPEAKER_25]: And they're saying that, you know, that is...

686
00:48:48,211 --> 00:49:03,682
[SPEAKER_25]: Basically, their lawsuit is that lazy arcade owners could in effectiveness make people think that this in-the-groove game is like DDR, when in fact the games, while similar in concept to those of us hardcore fans, we know the two games definitely have their distinctive differences.

687
00:49:04,682 --> 00:49:09,726
[SPEAKER_25]: And a lot of people said this lawsuit is about the arcade only, it's not going to affect the home version, nothing's going to happen.

688
00:49:09,866 --> 00:49:17,411
[SPEAKER_25]: And I remember sitting here on the show and I said, boys and girls, there is an important part of this lawsuit that addresses something called trade dress issues.

689
00:49:18,271 --> 00:49:27,639
[SPEAKER_25]: and one of the little things that they were suing on was the trade dress, saying that In The Groove not only was stowing away the machines, but the game itself looked like, felt like, DDR.

690
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:31,702
[SPEAKER_25]: But, I don't know, people just seemed to ignore that and they were saying, Arcane only, Arcane only.

691
00:49:31,742 --> 00:49:32,403
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, sure enough.

692
00:49:34,274 --> 00:49:43,561
[SPEAKER_25]: An amended version of the lawsuit was filed against Roxxor on July 1st, and now they've included Red Octane as part of their lawsuit.

693
00:49:44,502 --> 00:49:46,484
[SPEAKER_25]: And they actually have a press release over on their site.

694
00:49:46,924 --> 00:49:49,466
[SPEAKER_25]: We have it linked from our site over at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

695
00:49:51,147 --> 00:49:55,951
[SPEAKER_25]: Basically what it's saying is that... Where is it?

696
00:49:55,971 --> 00:49:56,311
[SPEAKER_25]: Where is it?

697
00:49:57,092 --> 00:49:58,653
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, that's the original lawsuit I'm looking at.

698
00:49:58,813 --> 00:49:59,714
[SPEAKER_25]: I want to look at the new one.

699
00:50:00,955 --> 00:50:01,375
[SPEAKER_25]: Let's see.

700
00:50:02,296 --> 00:50:02,636
[SPEAKER_25]: Here we go.

701
00:50:03,571 --> 00:50:16,941
[SPEAKER_25]: It says, in addition to the prior counts of the original complaint in which Konami seeks an injunction and damages against Rock Source in the Groove arcade dance simulation game, the amended complaint encompasses the recently released home version of Rock Source in the Groove game.

702
00:50:17,381 --> 00:50:24,246
[SPEAKER_25]: The amended complaint further includes patent infringement complaints against Red Octane, which is the publisher of the home version of In the Groove.

703
00:50:24,687 --> 00:50:25,728
[SPEAKER_25]: So, very interesting.

704
00:50:25,748 --> 00:50:28,810
[SPEAKER_25]: Before we get to the second part of this, very interesting because...

705
00:50:29,952 --> 00:50:33,413
[SPEAKER_25]: You know, this isn't just about the arcade mixes anymore.

706
00:50:33,493 --> 00:50:36,234
[SPEAKER_25]: This is about, in the group, it's too damn much like DDR.

707
00:50:36,334 --> 00:50:37,854
[SPEAKER_25]: Basically is what this boils down to, in my opinion.

708
00:50:38,275 --> 00:50:38,975
[SPEAKER_25]: No!

709
00:50:39,355 --> 00:50:40,615
[SPEAKER_25]: We haven't seen... Yeah, I know.

710
00:50:40,895 --> 00:50:41,396
[SPEAKER_25]: No shit, huh?

711
00:50:41,796 --> 00:50:45,577
[SPEAKER_25]: We haven't seen the specific court documentations yet.

712
00:50:46,317 --> 00:50:52,339
[SPEAKER_25]: Last time DDR Freak went into the government systems and actually pulled the original files out.

713
00:50:52,579 --> 00:50:54,119
[SPEAKER_25]: They haven't done that yet for this amendment.

714
00:50:54,159 --> 00:50:55,200
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know if it doesn't exist.

715
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:55,880
[SPEAKER_25]: You can't find it.

716
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:58,841
[SPEAKER_25]: I will hunt for it later on because I think I know where to go.

717
00:50:59,701 --> 00:51:06,246
[SPEAKER_25]: See if we can find it, but we don't have the exact document, so we haven't been able to read in too much besides what Konami's press release is saying, which of course is one-sided.

718
00:51:07,507 --> 00:51:12,210
[SPEAKER_25]: But the interesting part about this, they didn't just file against Red Octane.

719
00:51:12,310 --> 00:51:21,517
[SPEAKER_25]: The sentence I was reading goes on to say they have also complained against MadCatz, which is the publisher of the game MC Groove's Dance Craze.

720
00:51:22,398 --> 00:51:28,764
[SPEAKER_25]: All these additional accounts are based upon the accused game's infringement of Konami's patent rights in its Dance Dance Revolution arcade game.

721
00:51:29,025 --> 00:51:43,119
[SPEAKER_25]: Now what's interesting about this, those of you guys that have played the Mad Catz game, or even looked at screenshots and know something about it, know that, yes, it's a dance game, but the differences between the dance craze and DDR...

722
00:51:43,749 --> 00:51:50,530
[SPEAKER_25]: I think are a little more so than the differences between in the groove and DDR because of the fact that MC Groove's dance craze basically sucks my balls.

723
00:51:50,670 --> 00:51:51,851
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, it's an awful game.

724
00:51:52,711 --> 00:51:58,312
[SPEAKER_25]: Long version songs, steps that don't even go to the beat, they switch the order of the arrows, and they have that gyroscope mode.

725
00:51:58,452 --> 00:52:00,132
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know what the hell it was, but it was a piece of crap.

726
00:52:01,312 --> 00:52:06,253
[SPEAKER_25]: But they're getting sued now too over this, which is very interesting, needless to say.

727
00:52:08,154 --> 00:52:09,234
[SPEAKER_07]: The crack smoking mode.

728
00:52:10,446 --> 00:52:11,387
[SPEAKER_25]: What do you guys think about this?

729
00:52:11,427 --> 00:52:13,608
[SPEAKER_25]: I know you guys had very strong opinions the first time around.

730
00:52:13,628 --> 00:52:16,150
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm sure this just reinforces those, but I'm curious.

731
00:52:16,310 --> 00:52:17,331
[SPEAKER_07]: I was waiting for it to happen.

732
00:52:18,612 --> 00:52:19,672
[SPEAKER_07]: I was really waiting for it to happen.

733
00:52:20,453 --> 00:52:22,874
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm pretty much glad it is so far.

734
00:52:25,276 --> 00:52:31,640
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, these people think that just because Konami's sitting on their ass not getting our games out means that they can do it for them.

735
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:37,384
[SPEAKER_07]: But hopefully, I have a vague hope that this lights the fire under Konami to...

736
00:52:39,107 --> 00:52:39,327
[SPEAKER_07]: and so on.

737
00:53:03,482 --> 00:53:14,605
[SPEAKER_25]: said before, and I'll say it again, that I'm convinced that the reason why this whole thing happened in the first place is because In The Groove crossed that line and decided to invade the home market, which is Konami's turf right now.

738
00:53:14,865 --> 00:53:17,586
[SPEAKER_25]: So this whole thing, I think we've been working up to this the whole time.

739
00:53:18,346 --> 00:53:19,587
[SPEAKER_25]: This doesn't surprise me one bit.

740
00:53:19,947 --> 00:53:26,809
[SPEAKER_25]: And I think even the In The Groove hardcore fanbase, the rabid fanbase, even I think, at least from the reaction I'm reading on DDR Freaks forums,

741
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:31,583
[SPEAKER_25]: Even they're starting to say, you know what, yeah, okay, it's no big surprise.

742
00:53:31,603 --> 00:53:38,947
[SPEAKER_25]: But the big beef that I'm hearing from the In The Groove crowd, and tell me what you guys think about this, is the fact that Konami is not releasing product anymore.

743
00:53:39,288 --> 00:53:42,750
[SPEAKER_25]: Here's Roxxor attempting to improve upon that product.

744
00:53:43,030 --> 00:53:48,233
[SPEAKER_25]: Despite how you feel about In The Groove itself, they are attempting to keep it going in the arcade.

745
00:53:48,674 --> 00:53:50,895
[SPEAKER_07]: They're trying to fill a void and make money at the same time.

746
00:53:52,536 --> 00:53:53,537
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I really think that's it.

747
00:53:55,614 --> 00:54:22,155
[SPEAKER_25]: I think though, I'm of the school of thought though that while the rock sore corporate group may be in this for the money I think the people that started this whole thing I mean they were DDR fans when they started it I think they had good intentions at heart I think they wanted to keep the arcade's fan base alive and they really wanted to keep this game going because it didn't seem like Konami gave a crap anymore so I think they had the best intentions at heart I just think it's one of those things where

748
00:54:23,326 --> 00:54:23,866
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you for watching!

749
00:54:44,415 --> 00:54:46,597
[SPEAKER_25]: They're not going to make any money in Rockstars Gone Under.

750
00:54:47,898 --> 00:54:51,881
[SPEAKER_25]: No, I haven't played this MC Dance crazy thing.

751
00:54:52,582 --> 00:54:56,785
[SPEAKER_25]: But it's like, basically it comes down to this, it boils down to this.

752
00:54:57,326 --> 00:55:02,790
[SPEAKER_25]: It's very similar to DDR, like pretty much, you know, it's reskinned DDR as you want to call it.

753
00:55:03,130 --> 00:55:06,073
[SPEAKER_25]: But then again, you have to also go into like, look at the fighting games out there.

754
00:55:06,233 --> 00:55:09,055
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat and stuff.

755
00:55:09,394 --> 00:55:10,375
[SPEAKER_25]: They're not that different.

756
00:55:10,395 --> 00:55:11,235
[SPEAKER_25]: They're pretty similar.

757
00:55:11,455 --> 00:55:15,358
[SPEAKER_25]: But I guess they're different enough to where they can't sue each other over that type of stuff.

758
00:55:16,599 --> 00:55:25,565
[SPEAKER_25]: So what people need to do out there now is if you want to make a music game, feel free to do so, but just make it different enough to where people aren't, you know... I mean, come on.

759
00:55:25,605 --> 00:55:39,175
[SPEAKER_25]: They weren't even trying within the groove at all to make it any different from... I mean, they were adding stuff to it, whoop-a-dee-doo, and they made the arrows come not quite straight up, but you can change them so they're that way.

760
00:55:39,588 --> 00:55:41,790
[SPEAKER_25]: And they sort of changed the way the arrows look.

761
00:55:42,410 --> 00:55:43,231
[SPEAKER_25]: That's not enough.

762
00:55:43,271 --> 00:55:58,562
[SPEAKER_25]: That's like, you know, taking a Honda Civic out there, painting it a different color, and adding a spoiler to it, and calling it, you know, a Loki's Fast Car, you know, or something like that.

763
00:55:58,923 --> 00:55:59,543
[SPEAKER_25]: It doesn't work.

764
00:55:59,963 --> 00:56:01,064
[SPEAKER_25]: It's the same damn thing.

765
00:56:03,746 --> 00:56:04,607
[SPEAKER_25]: So that's why I think about that.

766
00:56:07,159 --> 00:56:11,983
[SPEAKER_25]: Angel is someone who I think, I get the impression from you anyway, you respect both games.

767
00:56:12,823 --> 00:56:13,684
[SPEAKER_25]: You're kind of like me.

768
00:56:15,065 --> 00:56:24,973
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm not like whoopity-doo over in the groove, but for me it's filling a void that Konami isn't giving us right now with the arcade mixes, and I'm content with it.

769
00:56:25,413 --> 00:56:25,893
[SPEAKER_25]: It's there.

770
00:56:26,134 --> 00:56:26,634
[SPEAKER_25]: I play it.

771
00:56:26,774 --> 00:56:27,255
[SPEAKER_25]: It's cool.

772
00:56:27,375 --> 00:56:31,518
[SPEAKER_25]: I love the USB support, but I completely understand where Konami's coming from on this.

773
00:56:31,558 --> 00:56:33,079
[SPEAKER_25]: I think they're just protecting their own shit.

774
00:56:33,099 --> 00:56:33,940
[SPEAKER_25]: What do you think about this?

775
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:34,420
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no.

776
00:56:35,060 --> 00:56:36,802
[SPEAKER_06]: You hit the nail on the head there, and I do...

777
00:56:37,526 --> 00:56:41,927
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I do agree with Jamie as far as, you know, I knew it was going to happen.

778
00:56:41,967 --> 00:56:45,188
[SPEAKER_06]: It was just a matter of when, and it's happened now.

779
00:56:45,308 --> 00:56:48,768
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, we just got to wait to see what happens.

780
00:56:48,928 --> 00:56:56,930
[SPEAKER_06]: But I do think that Red Octane is still selling it on their site as far as I know, or as far as I've seen.

781
00:56:56,950 --> 00:56:57,370
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

782
00:56:57,770 --> 00:57:00,091
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, you might want to, seriously, you might want to run out and get this game.

783
00:57:00,111 --> 00:57:01,471
[SPEAKER_06]: Might want to run out and get it now.

784
00:57:01,691 --> 00:57:03,751
[SPEAKER_25]: It could be a collector's item or something else, that's for sure.

785
00:57:04,491 --> 00:57:05,332
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so...

786
00:57:09,048 --> 00:57:20,040
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so, you know, Rob's right, just pick it up if you haven't picked it up yet, if you think it's, you know, not going to be sold anymore because of the whole, this whole thing.

787
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:26,426
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, I mean, I pretty much, I have respect for both games, so I can't really say much, but I knew it was going to happen eventually.

788
00:57:26,727 --> 00:57:30,170
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, I think you're kind of the same school of thought that I am.

789
00:57:30,551 --> 00:57:30,771
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

790
00:57:33,530 --> 00:57:34,050
[SPEAKER_25]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

791
00:57:52,350 --> 00:57:59,875
[SPEAKER_25]: Not named in this whole thing, but of course you have to remember, Anamiro and Konami kind of have this history of going back and forth, and they settled, supposedly a long time ago.

792
00:58:00,295 --> 00:58:02,496
[SPEAKER_25]: So, this is why Anamiro's not being touched.

793
00:58:02,777 --> 00:58:05,718
[SPEAKER_25]: Which is interesting, because now people are going, how does this affect In The Groove 2?

794
00:58:06,519 --> 00:58:08,680
[SPEAKER_25]: Honestly, people, I don't know.

795
00:58:09,301 --> 00:58:10,721
[SPEAKER_25]: And I'm not going to speculate anymore.

796
00:58:10,982 --> 00:58:13,423
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know how this is going to affect In The Groove 2, and you know what?

797
00:58:13,503 --> 00:58:14,224
[SPEAKER_25]: You don't either.

798
00:58:15,384 --> 00:58:16,025
[SPEAKER_25]: Nobody does.

799
00:58:16,465 --> 00:58:17,165
[SPEAKER_25]: We'll find out.

800
00:58:17,506 --> 00:58:19,467
[SPEAKER_25]: A lot of it has to do with how this is going to go.

801
00:58:20,222 --> 00:58:28,629
[SPEAKER_25]: So, I kind of refuse to speculate anymore on what's going to happen with In The Groove 2 because this whole thing has become such a damn mess that it's hard to say what's going to happen.

802
00:58:29,029 --> 00:58:32,231
[SPEAKER_25]: Just play the game while you can and hope it's still there tomorrow.

803
00:58:32,712 --> 00:58:33,733
[SPEAKER_25]: Enjoy it while it lasts.

804
00:58:33,753 --> 00:58:35,474
[SPEAKER_25]: And if it lasts a long time, great.

805
00:58:36,775 --> 00:58:37,956
[SPEAKER_25]: I guess that's all I can say on that.

806
00:58:39,517 --> 00:58:40,138
[SPEAKER_25]: Any other thoughts?

807
00:58:40,618 --> 00:58:45,802
[SPEAKER_25]: Is this going to make you, Loki, finally run out and get a copy of In The Groove so you can have a home mix of it?

808
00:58:46,837 --> 00:58:47,537
[SPEAKER_25]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

809
00:59:13,755 --> 00:59:14,796
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, if you say so.

810
00:59:39,807 --> 00:59:40,568
[SPEAKER_25]: You guys are awful.

811
00:59:43,651 --> 00:59:45,072
[SPEAKER_25]: It'll be a collector's item.

812
00:59:45,232 --> 00:59:45,592
[SPEAKER_25]: I know.

813
00:59:45,953 --> 00:59:46,273
[SPEAKER_25]: I'll go on eBay.

814
00:59:46,293 --> 00:59:52,399
[SPEAKER_25]: Are you talking about... I'll make even... I'll write comments in the manual too, you know.

815
00:59:52,599 --> 00:59:54,921
[SPEAKER_25]: Saying, this game is that way like DDR.

816
00:59:55,262 --> 00:59:56,062
[SPEAKER_25]: What are you talking about?

817
00:59:56,363 --> 00:59:57,704
[SPEAKER_25]: Anyway, Loki, Loki, Loki.

818
00:59:58,164 --> 00:59:58,785
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright, so...

819
00:59:59,916 --> 01:00:16,296
[SPEAKER_25]: either way, somebody's gonna be pissed off no matter what the result of this thing I mean, even if In The Groove keeps going on the DDR fans will be pissed off and if In The Groove production stops the In The Groove fans will be pissed off do you think, though, that if Konami turns out another arcade mix that it'll appease people?

820
01:00:17,026 --> 01:00:22,470
[SPEAKER_25]: and maybe they'll go, oh, okay, so Konami was working on something this whole time, now this whole lawsuit makes sense.

821
01:00:22,490 --> 01:00:23,952
[SPEAKER_25]: Do you think that's going to appease people?

822
01:00:24,472 --> 01:00:25,853
[SPEAKER_25]: Of course, nothing's going to appease everybody.

823
01:00:25,993 --> 01:00:27,735
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to have to, honestly.

824
01:00:29,996 --> 01:00:33,419
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to get a lot of pretty outraged mail over this.

825
01:00:33,519 --> 01:00:35,361
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to have to do something drastic.

826
01:00:36,942 --> 01:00:38,423
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, they want to keep your fan base.

827
01:00:39,364 --> 01:00:39,804
[SPEAKER_25]: You know what?

828
01:00:40,064 --> 01:00:42,206
[SPEAKER_25]: I want to bring up a tip that was brought up

829
01:00:42,998 --> 01:00:43,639
[SPEAKER_25]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

830
01:01:13,402 --> 01:01:14,683
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll at least stay stationary.

831
01:01:17,485 --> 01:01:18,625
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright, so something to think about.

832
01:01:19,326 --> 01:01:24,109
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright kids, I think we'll go to a break, we'll come back, and we'll take your calls on this issue if anybody wants to talk to us about it.

833
01:01:24,169 --> 01:01:25,269
[SPEAKER_25]: Loki, and then some other news.

834
01:01:26,010 --> 01:01:26,990
[SPEAKER_25]: You know what I'm pissed off about?

835
01:01:27,070 --> 01:01:27,251
[SPEAKER_25]: What?

836
01:01:27,291 --> 01:01:27,771
[SPEAKER_25]: The guy game.

837
01:01:27,791 --> 01:01:33,595
[SPEAKER_25]: They pulled it off the market completely, even the PC version, but now there's a DVD out there with all the nude cutscenes in it.

838
01:01:34,315 --> 01:01:35,175
[SPEAKER_25]: That's not a surprise.

839
01:01:35,216 --> 01:01:36,556
[SPEAKER_25]: I thought they pulled this thing months ago.

840
01:01:36,897 --> 01:01:40,319
[SPEAKER_25]: But my copy that... er, my purchase copy...

841
01:01:41,306 --> 01:01:41,867
[SPEAKER_25]: and DarkSakura.

842
01:01:56,081 --> 01:02:01,824
[SPEAKER_25]: In this break, to be fair, we will play some music from In The Groove 2 because we actually haven't played any of the new music from In The Groove 2.

843
01:02:02,164 --> 01:02:05,966
[SPEAKER_25]: So one of our listeners, Misty, was kind enough to hook me up, so to speak.

844
01:02:05,986 --> 01:02:07,927
[SPEAKER_25]: So we're going to play three new tracks from In The Groove 2.

845
01:02:08,067 --> 01:02:13,851
[SPEAKER_25]: We're going to play Energizer, Voresprung, Dirch, Techno, and Summer, the Speedy Mix.

846
01:02:14,011 --> 01:02:15,992
[SPEAKER_25]: So we're going to play these songs and check it out.

847
01:02:16,192 --> 01:02:21,775
[SPEAKER_25]: And then we'll be back with your calls in regards to this recent development in the lawsuit world.

848
01:02:21,815 --> 01:02:22,655
[SPEAKER_25]: We'll be back after this.

849
01:02:23,076 --> 01:02:23,736

875
01:10:19,397 --> 01:10:19,817
[SPEAKER_25]: It's super.

876
01:10:20,606 --> 01:10:22,927
[SPEAKER_07]: We are becoming Apple-ized.

877
01:10:23,507 --> 01:10:26,087
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, you know, and I'm thinking about buying an Apple laptop, too.

878
01:10:26,147 --> 01:10:28,088
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm slowly converting to the Mac way.

879
01:10:28,148 --> 01:10:30,048
[SPEAKER_25]: Don't you even open your damn mouth, Loki.

880
01:10:30,068 --> 01:10:31,128
[SPEAKER_07]: That's okay.

881
01:10:31,188 --> 01:10:39,810
[SPEAKER_07]: My next computer, I'm actually going to be building a new PC, but the next one I actually buy pieced is going to be one of the Mac Mini G5s.

882
01:10:39,850 --> 01:10:46,752
[SPEAKER_25]: Don't worry, I'm not knocking your perspective purchase of a Mac product.

883
01:10:47,395 --> 01:10:52,940
[SPEAKER_25]: In fact, I was actually thinking of doing my own infomercial for Macintosh and Apple products.

884
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:55,082
[SPEAKER_25]: It goes a little something like this.

885
01:10:55,442 --> 01:11:00,266
[SPEAKER_25]: Do you like stuff that's pretty but does absolutely nothing that Apple is for you?

886
01:11:01,727 --> 01:11:05,150
[SPEAKER_25]: Because my computer purchases are based on color and not performance.

887
01:11:06,191 --> 01:11:07,632
[SPEAKER_25]: I like stuff that's smooth and shiny.

888
01:11:08,053 --> 01:11:09,874
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, and then they could sell Microsoft Windows.

889
01:11:10,154 --> 01:11:11,916
[SPEAKER_25]: Hey kids, do you like spyware?

890
01:11:13,735 --> 01:11:15,076
[SPEAKER_25]: No, I'm sorry, that's Internet Explorer.

891
01:11:15,336 --> 01:11:15,816
[SPEAKER_25]: You know what?

892
01:11:15,896 --> 01:11:17,157
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want to... Hey!

893
01:11:17,337 --> 01:11:17,577
[SPEAKER_25]: What?

894
01:11:19,678 --> 01:11:25,622
[SPEAKER_07]: If you work in graphics, video editing, anything that has to do with audio-visual, a Mac is for you.

895
01:11:25,862 --> 01:11:27,183
[SPEAKER_25]: That was a long time ago.

896
01:11:27,263 --> 01:11:27,883
[SPEAKER_25]: Not anymore.

897
01:11:28,504 --> 01:11:29,224
[SPEAKER_25]: I beg to differ.

898
01:11:29,344 --> 01:11:30,105
[SPEAKER_25]: I beg to differ as well.

899
01:11:30,185 --> 01:11:39,490
[SPEAKER_07]: After having done my Photoshop homework on a top-line PC and then gone back and doing all my touch-ups on a G5, oh yeah, world of difference.

900
01:11:40,331 --> 01:11:42,832
[SPEAKER_25]: To answer a question in the chat room, 15-inch PowerBook.

901
01:11:45,529 --> 01:11:46,671
[SPEAKER_25]: That's why I nicknamed my penis.

902
01:11:47,633 --> 01:11:48,435
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

903
01:11:53,286 --> 01:11:54,288
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't hear that.

904
01:11:54,408 --> 01:11:55,070
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I did.

905
01:11:55,130 --> 01:11:55,571
[SPEAKER_06]: Never mind.

906
01:11:58,464 --> 01:12:01,165
[SPEAKER_25]: Let's go back to the previous topic we were talking here.

907
01:12:02,005 --> 01:12:05,586
[SPEAKER_25]: We actually had a question from our chat room during the break here about this whole lawsuit issue.

908
01:12:05,626 --> 01:12:07,767
[SPEAKER_25]: Dark Knight wanted to know, hey Sky, just a thought.

909
01:12:08,287 --> 01:12:11,248
[SPEAKER_25]: With this revised lawsuit, what about Guitar Hero?

910
01:12:11,328 --> 01:12:15,389
[SPEAKER_25]: Since Red Octane is publishing that game, do you think Konami will go after that as well?

911
01:12:15,989 --> 01:12:16,109
[SPEAKER_24]: No.

912
01:12:16,510 --> 01:12:16,630
[SPEAKER_25]: No.

913
01:12:17,110 --> 01:12:17,970
[SPEAKER_25]: I think no.

914
01:12:18,070 --> 01:12:22,511
[SPEAKER_25]: If Red Octane is still in business after this, which I think they will be, I don't think this is going to set them back too far.

915
01:12:24,772 --> 01:12:26,653
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't think this is going to affect Guitar Hero at all.

916
01:12:26,713 --> 01:12:27,013
[SPEAKER_25]: And I think...

917
01:12:28,090 --> 01:12:37,157
[SPEAKER_07]: Had Red Octane stayed as a third-party peripheral, I don't think Konami would have had a problem with them at all.

918
01:12:37,598 --> 01:12:40,260
[SPEAKER_25]: But they stepped on the toes.

919
01:12:40,300 --> 01:12:42,341
[SPEAKER_25]: That's another very interesting thing about this whole lawsuit.

920
01:12:42,381 --> 01:12:45,384
[SPEAKER_25]: Konami really hasn't been putting out their own pads.

921
01:12:45,424 --> 01:12:47,445
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, sure, there's bundle packs, but let's face it.

922
01:12:47,866 --> 01:12:53,270
[SPEAKER_25]: Most of us are getting our pads from either Red Octane, Mad Catz, or one of those other countless DDR pad companies.

923
01:12:53,310 --> 01:12:56,132
[SPEAKER_25]: But Mad Catz and Red Octane admittedly being the two biggest companies.

924
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:58,240
[SPEAKER_25]: Konami's suing both of them now.

925
01:12:58,940 --> 01:13:02,061
[SPEAKER_25]: Are they going to say, well, F you, Konami, we're not going to make these pads anymore?

926
01:13:02,081 --> 01:13:09,702
[SPEAKER_07]: See, they've gone from being, like, protective footwear to being platform shoes that step on the toes of Konami.

927
01:13:09,782 --> 01:13:11,323
[SPEAKER_25]: Honestly, though, come on now.

928
01:13:11,463 --> 01:13:12,243
[SPEAKER_25]: Red Octane.

929
01:13:12,603 --> 01:13:16,464
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, I did not know that In The Groove was anything like DDR.

930
01:13:16,984 --> 01:13:17,664
[SPEAKER_25]: No, come on.

931
01:13:17,864 --> 01:13:21,605
[SPEAKER_25]: They knew what they were getting into when they decided to go ahead and publish these games.

932
01:13:22,025 --> 01:13:23,805
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, it's retarded to say otherwise.

933
01:13:24,392 --> 01:13:31,018
[SPEAKER_25]: And honestly, they're not going to sue them over Guitar Hero because Guitar Hero is different enough from Guitar Freaks to be its own game.

934
01:13:31,178 --> 01:13:32,339
[SPEAKER_25]: It's more like Amplitude.

935
01:13:32,399 --> 01:13:33,200
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, exactly.

936
01:13:33,220 --> 01:13:36,223
[SPEAKER_25]: Since Harmonix is developing it, it's all kosher.

937
01:13:36,243 --> 01:13:37,064
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, exactly.

938
01:13:37,124 --> 01:13:39,846
[SPEAKER_25]: So I'm all for that because it actually looks good.

939
01:13:39,906 --> 01:13:41,347
[SPEAKER_25]: They're doing stuff to improve the game.

940
01:13:41,588 --> 01:13:43,730
[SPEAKER_25]: It doesn't try to copy something else.

941
01:13:43,950 --> 01:13:46,532
[SPEAKER_25]: And of course, our chat room now.

942
01:13:47,073 --> 01:13:48,394
[SPEAKER_25]: I have a fat lawsuit.

943
01:13:48,634 --> 01:13:50,656
[SPEAKER_25]: Let's rub our lawsuits together sometime.

944
01:13:52,236 --> 01:13:52,636
[SPEAKER_25]: Lawsuit?

945
01:13:52,776 --> 01:13:54,517
[SPEAKER_25]: It sounds like fresh lawsuit in here.

946
01:13:54,917 --> 01:13:55,998
[SPEAKER_25]: Is that your lawsuit?

947
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:01,481
[SPEAKER_25]: Skype line is open, boys and girls.

948
01:14:01,541 --> 01:14:10,285
[SPEAKER_25]: If you would like to talk to us live, head on over to our chat room, www.orangeloungeradio.com and click on interact with us.

949
01:14:10,345 --> 01:14:12,726
[SPEAKER_25]: And that laughter there means we've already picked up a call.

950
01:14:12,766 --> 01:14:14,167
[SPEAKER_25]: So hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

951
01:14:14,247 --> 01:14:14,627
[SPEAKER_25]: Who dis?

952
01:14:15,632 --> 01:14:17,194
[SPEAKER_22]: It's Ron-chan, who you think it is.

953
01:14:17,334 --> 01:14:18,014
[SPEAKER_25]: Hello, Ron-chan.

954
01:14:18,034 --> 01:14:24,841
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, see, I can tell by the icon, but the radio bit that we do is we play stupid so that you introduce yourself to our listeners.

955
01:14:25,301 --> 01:14:27,043
[SPEAKER_25]: That's how it works.

956
01:14:27,083 --> 01:14:27,883
[SPEAKER_22]: Hello.

957
01:14:27,903 --> 01:14:29,425
[SPEAKER_22]: Hey, Ok-chan.

958
01:14:29,625 --> 01:14:30,366
[SPEAKER_22]: Ron-chan.

959
01:14:32,448 --> 01:14:33,589
[SPEAKER_25]: What is up, dude?

960
01:14:34,950 --> 01:14:36,231
[SPEAKER_22]: What is up with Konami?

961
01:14:36,291 --> 01:14:40,015
[SPEAKER_22]: I swear, like they're trying to violate the fan base or something like that.

962
01:14:40,295 --> 01:14:41,336
[SPEAKER_22]: That's how I honestly feel.

963
01:14:41,938 --> 01:14:45,399
[SPEAKER_25]: You're a little bit choppy, but I'm going to interpret for those that might have missed it there.

964
01:14:45,899 --> 01:14:50,721
[SPEAKER_25]: Basically, Ranma's saying that they're violating their fan base with this whole thing.

965
01:14:51,882 --> 01:14:57,724
[SPEAKER_25]: I agree to an extent that they're pissing a lot of people off with this, but at the same time, don't they have a right to protect what's theirs?

966
01:14:58,684 --> 01:14:59,504
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, they do.

967
01:14:59,724 --> 01:15:03,666
[SPEAKER_22]: It's sort of like they want to be the granddaddy of the dancing games.

968
01:15:03,726 --> 01:15:08,987
[SPEAKER_22]: Now, here comes a bunch of new guys come along with something, and they're like, oh no, you can't have that.

969
01:15:09,007 --> 01:15:10,668
[SPEAKER_22]: You must play our game only, not theirs.

970
01:15:11,064 --> 01:15:19,689
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, but considering they did invent DDR, I mean, you could go back and say, well, there was Dance Aerobics, but BS, DDR is its own thing.

971
01:15:22,510 --> 01:15:27,853
[SPEAKER_25]: I think they're just kind of protecting what's theirs, and I think what kind of ticks people off is that this is where people get pissed off.

972
01:15:28,574 --> 01:15:38,519
[SPEAKER_25]: In the groove, probably, I may get yelled at for saying this, but in the groove, probably wouldn't exist if Konami had continued to put out arcade releases.

973
01:15:38,959 --> 01:15:39,420
[SPEAKER_25]: Agree, disagree?

974
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:39,860
[SPEAKER_25]: You're correct.

975
01:15:40,464 --> 01:15:41,065
[SPEAKER_25]: I agree with you.

976
01:15:41,785 --> 01:15:48,611
[SPEAKER_25]: So, in a sense, I think where people get pissed off is that they feel like Konami abandoned us.

977
01:15:49,011 --> 01:16:00,180
[SPEAKER_25]: Even though they've been doing home mixes, let's face it, the reason why the fan base is so large is because we had arcade tournaments and arcade freestyle competitions and all these things going on in the arcade.

978
01:16:00,420 --> 01:16:02,202
[SPEAKER_25]: We were not doing this stuff in our houses.

979
01:16:02,462 --> 01:16:07,226
[SPEAKER_25]: We're doing it now because we don't have any other choice, but this whole thing started because of the arcades.

980
01:16:07,666 --> 01:16:11,848
[SPEAKER_25]: And the home versions, as good as they've been, are not the same thing.

981
01:16:12,108 --> 01:16:17,890
[SPEAKER_25]: You don't... Remember when we all used to go to Roseville Golf Land on Wednesday nights, back when Roseville Golf Land was cool?

982
01:16:18,250 --> 01:16:19,891
[SPEAKER_25]: We used to play DDR, we had a good old time.

983
01:16:20,471 --> 01:16:23,012
[SPEAKER_25]: You can't get that same feeling with a home mix.

984
01:16:23,072 --> 01:16:26,794
[SPEAKER_25]: And there's people all across the nation, like we are, that did that.

985
01:16:26,834 --> 01:16:29,895
[SPEAKER_25]: And we're all excited when Max 2 came out, because you had the new songs unlocked.

986
01:16:30,315 --> 01:16:31,916
[SPEAKER_25]: And Konami, in a sense, abandoned us.

987
01:16:32,609 --> 01:16:39,113
[SPEAKER_25]: But, okay, now to even further contradict myself or whatever you want to say, at the same time, we were never supposed to have those games in the first place.

988
01:16:40,194 --> 01:16:41,715
[SPEAKER_25]: Ideally, because they were Japanese mixes.

989
01:16:41,775 --> 01:16:43,336
[SPEAKER_25]: We weren't supposed to have them in the first place.

990
01:16:43,596 --> 01:16:48,319
[SPEAKER_25]: But I think Konami was turning a blind eye to the whole thing because it sold home mixes for them.

991
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:50,321
[SPEAKER_25]: That's how it all boils down, in my opinion.

992
01:16:51,161 --> 01:16:54,303
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, and they were making money off the import games being sold over here, too.

993
01:16:54,443 --> 01:16:55,204
[SPEAKER_22]: That's all it was.

994
01:16:55,924 --> 01:16:56,124
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah.

995
01:16:56,785 --> 01:16:56,925
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah.

996
01:16:58,874 --> 01:17:00,415
[SPEAKER_25]: Let's look at the reality of this, though.

997
01:17:01,075 --> 01:17:03,216
[SPEAKER_25]: Let's look at where DDR is at now.

998
01:17:03,576 --> 01:17:05,696
[SPEAKER_25]: Where is DDR making all the money now?

999
01:17:05,816 --> 01:17:08,077
[SPEAKER_25]: DDR is making all its money on the home mixes, right?

1000
01:17:08,097 --> 01:17:11,838
[SPEAKER_25]: Konami sends out this press release in January saying, Hey, look how big our dick is.

1001
01:17:11,898 --> 01:17:15,059
[SPEAKER_25]: We sold a million copies of the home versions of DDR today.

1002
01:17:15,139 --> 01:17:16,459
[SPEAKER_25]: We are so freaking rad.

1003
01:17:17,219 --> 01:17:22,761
[SPEAKER_25]: So Konami's bread and butter right now is the home mixes of DDR.

1004
01:17:23,527 --> 01:17:29,570
[SPEAKER_25]: So now here comes this game that's infringing on the home mixes, which we'll refer to as, I can't believe it's not butter.

1005
01:17:31,131 --> 01:17:32,732
[SPEAKER_25]: And now Konami's ticked off.

1006
01:17:33,772 --> 01:17:36,494
[SPEAKER_25]: I think that's just kind of where this all boils down from.

1007
01:17:36,774 --> 01:17:47,519
[SPEAKER_25]: But the percentage of people who are arcade, rabid fandomness is actually, even though consider the DDR Freak has 50,000 members, ITG Freak, not as many.

1008
01:17:48,620 --> 01:17:49,320
[SPEAKER_25]: Like it or not,

1009
01:17:50,566 --> 01:17:54,449
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know how many members of ITG Freak there are offhand, but let me just say, let's say 10,000.

1010
01:17:54,709 --> 01:17:57,571
[SPEAKER_25]: I know I think I might be overdoing it for him a little bit.

1011
01:17:57,932 --> 01:17:59,613
[SPEAKER_25]: Let's say ITG Freak has 10,000.

1012
01:18:00,754 --> 01:18:02,595
[SPEAKER_25]: 10,000 out of a million is still 1%.

1013
01:18:04,056 --> 01:18:06,678
[SPEAKER_25]: Konami can piss off 1% of its fanbase and cut their losses.

1014
01:18:07,279 --> 01:18:14,524
[SPEAKER_25]: Because Extreme 2 and Ultramix 3 stand to be so big that I think things are only going to get better for them.

1015
01:18:15,825 --> 01:18:16,105
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know.

1016
01:18:16,165 --> 01:18:17,446
[SPEAKER_25]: That's just kind of my perspective on it.

1017
01:18:18,581 --> 01:18:20,362
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, and I completely agree with your perspective.

1018
01:18:20,542 --> 01:18:22,624
[SPEAKER_22]: See, personally, I'm not an ITG freak.

1019
01:18:22,864 --> 01:18:23,645
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm not a fanboy.

1020
01:18:23,845 --> 01:18:24,946
[SPEAKER_22]: I like both games.

1021
01:18:25,286 --> 01:18:30,229
[SPEAKER_22]: I have the mixes on both sides, and I enjoy playing them, you know?

1022
01:18:30,810 --> 01:18:37,835
[SPEAKER_22]: Overall, if it wasn't for the fact that the fans were screaming for more DDR, and the groove wouldn't even be here right now.

1023
01:18:38,422 --> 01:18:42,906
[SPEAKER_22]: I just feel that, you're right, Konami did ignore the fans for a while.

1024
01:18:43,386 --> 01:18:45,208
[SPEAKER_22]: Some ass came along to do something.

1025
01:18:45,368 --> 01:18:50,032
[SPEAKER_22]: It just gave them a reason to... Basically, they just woke the sleeping bear.

1026
01:18:50,453 --> 01:18:52,274
[SPEAKER_25]: By the way, I way overshot it.

1027
01:18:52,494 --> 01:18:55,817
[SPEAKER_25]: Just under 2,000 members on ITGFreak.com right now.

1028
01:18:56,137 --> 01:18:56,498
[SPEAKER_25]: Hell no.

1029
01:18:56,518 --> 01:18:57,158
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, shit.

1030
01:18:57,599 --> 01:18:59,220
[SPEAKER_25]: So, I mean, look at that.

1031
01:19:00,822 --> 01:19:02,363
[SPEAKER_25]: One-fifth of a percent, you know?

1032
01:19:03,004 --> 01:19:09,129
[SPEAKER_25]: So, Konami can cut their losses by pissing off the... Assuming every single one of those people are pissed off, which they're not.

1033
01:19:09,270 --> 01:19:10,791
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm a member of ITGFreak.com.

1034
01:19:10,871 --> 01:19:11,592
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm not pissed off.

1035
01:19:12,353 --> 01:19:14,334
[SPEAKER_25]: But I respect in the groove.

1036
01:19:14,455 --> 01:19:16,697
[SPEAKER_25]: I respect what in the groove was built on.

1037
01:19:17,057 --> 01:19:21,962
[SPEAKER_25]: It was guys like us who happen to have a little programming knowledge who wanted... I mean, let's face it.

1038
01:19:22,222 --> 01:19:23,724
[SPEAKER_25]: We all have... Oh, God.

1039
01:19:23,784 --> 01:19:24,745
[SPEAKER_25]: Now I'm, like, going off on this.

1040
01:19:24,965 --> 01:19:26,006
[SPEAKER_25]: We've all expressed...

1041
01:19:26,775 --> 01:19:27,937
[SPEAKER_25]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,

1042
01:19:41,955 --> 01:19:44,156
[SPEAKER_25]: And that was how they were going to continue on with it.

1043
01:19:44,196 --> 01:19:46,697
[SPEAKER_25]: So I respect where In The Groove came from.

1044
01:19:46,797 --> 01:19:50,019
[SPEAKER_25]: And they wanted to improve on the things they thought needed improving.

1045
01:19:50,499 --> 01:19:54,581
[SPEAKER_25]: And despite the way some of us feel about the game, to these guys, it's an improvement on the game.

1046
01:19:54,821 --> 01:19:58,122
[SPEAKER_25]: The problem is, is it just, I think, got carried away.

1047
01:19:58,762 --> 01:20:01,284
[SPEAKER_25]: And money will do amazing things to people.

1048
01:20:01,344 --> 01:20:09,027
[SPEAKER_25]: And I think there was a little bit... I apologize to anybody on the ITG team that might be offended by this comment, but I think there was a little bit of cockiness there.

1049
01:20:09,307 --> 01:20:18,575
[SPEAKER_25]: On their end, that they were going to get away with this for forever because, and I say that because, on the message boards for the longest time, people would say, how is this legal?

1050
01:20:18,695 --> 01:20:20,757
[SPEAKER_25]: And the response would be, shut up, it is.

1051
01:20:21,938 --> 01:20:23,199
[SPEAKER_25]: And now Konami's calling their bluff.

1052
01:20:24,900 --> 01:20:28,803
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright, now here's my next question, something I said, somebody has mentioned in chat room earlier.

1053
01:20:29,203 --> 01:20:37,050
[SPEAKER_22]: Now that Konami's going after Red Octane and Mad Catz, do you think they'll also go after the creators of Step Mania, even though it's something free to give away?

1054
01:20:42,236 --> 01:20:49,002
[SPEAKER_25]: Technically, they kind of already are if you want to go in the school of thought that In the Groove is based off of Stepmania.

1055
01:20:49,382 --> 01:20:53,886
[SPEAKER_25]: But as for the Stepmania PC itself, I don't think they're going to.

1056
01:20:54,186 --> 01:21:01,232
[SPEAKER_25]: I think because of the fact that Stepmania is open source and they're not making a dime off it, I think it makes it a little harder to get, if you know what I mean.

1057
01:21:02,914 --> 01:21:05,736
[SPEAKER_25]: And I think, again, Stepmania is so underground.

1058
01:21:05,756 --> 01:21:07,758
[SPEAKER_25]: They're not putting Stepmania in stores.

1059
01:21:08,699 --> 01:21:08,919
[SPEAKER_16]: Mm-mm.

1060
01:21:09,426 --> 01:21:31,590
[SPEAKER_25]: so I think for that reason Stepmania has been able to stay under the radar even though most of the rabid fanbase knows about it Stepmania in many senses is still a little bit under the radar when it comes into the whole big corporate scheme of things so I think they've been able to dodge the bullet for a while now and I don't see them suddenly becoming a target but the minute they try to make money off of it I think it will be a target

1061
01:21:33,038 --> 01:21:33,678
[SPEAKER_25]: And you're right, Loki.

1062
01:21:33,698 --> 01:21:37,159
[SPEAKER_25]: It's probably for the best that your machine never did take off, because you'd be in the same boat right now.

1063
01:21:37,259 --> 01:21:39,299
[SPEAKER_25]: Actually, no, it wouldn't matter, because it's one arcade.

1064
01:21:39,439 --> 01:21:40,119
[SPEAKER_25]: It'd be their fault.

1065
01:21:40,359 --> 01:21:42,260
[SPEAKER_25]: But if it took off, etc.

1066
01:21:43,660 --> 01:21:44,860
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm not that dumb.

1067
01:21:46,181 --> 01:21:47,721
[SPEAKER_25]: So, any other thoughts for us, Ranma?

1068
01:21:48,781 --> 01:21:49,601
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, I'll tell you this.

1069
01:21:49,621 --> 01:21:56,823
[SPEAKER_22]: The way this lawsuit's going, if Konami says cease and desist on ITG, those copies are going to be worth a lot of money in the next few weeks.

1070
01:21:57,763 --> 01:22:00,143
[SPEAKER_25]: It's going to be the new Tengen Tetris, is what it is.

1071
01:22:00,964 --> 01:22:02,064
[SPEAKER_25]: Exactly what I was thinking.

1072
01:22:02,624 --> 01:22:02,904
[SPEAKER_25]: All right.

1073
01:22:03,629 --> 01:22:04,449
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, have a good one, Ranma.

1074
01:22:04,469 --> 01:22:06,370
[SPEAKER_25]: Thanks for giving us a call and giving us your opinion.

1075
01:22:06,390 --> 01:22:07,150
[SPEAKER_25]: We appreciate it, okay?

1076
01:22:07,170 --> 01:22:07,730
[SPEAKER_22]: Later!

1077
01:22:24,113 --> 01:22:26,915
[SPEAKER_25]: That reminds me, I'm actually going to be out there for a DDR tournament.

1078
01:22:27,015 --> 01:22:29,958
[SPEAKER_25]: And get this, I haven't been to, it's actually a DDR slash in the group tournament.

1079
01:22:29,998 --> 01:22:33,200
[SPEAKER_25]: And get this, I haven't been to like a DDR tournament since March Madness, like last year.

1080
01:22:33,260 --> 01:22:34,021
[SPEAKER_25]: So it's been a long time.

1081
01:22:34,401 --> 01:22:42,768
[SPEAKER_25]: But I figured since I'm going to be on the East Coast anyway for work-related things, my day job, I might as well go ahead and say hello to the folks at the tournament on the East Coast.

1082
01:22:43,168 --> 01:22:48,613
[SPEAKER_25]: So assuming that this tournament actually happens, because there hasn't been a whole lot of activity on the forums, but I'm planning on it.

1083
01:22:49,253 --> 01:22:51,535
[SPEAKER_25]: It's taking place over at 8 on the break.

1084
01:22:52,048 --> 01:23:03,057
[SPEAKER_25]: and it's happening on August 7th and it's called COTC3 Champions of the Coast is what it's called.

1085
01:23:03,077 --> 01:23:04,939
[SPEAKER_25]: That's happening at 8 on the break on August 7th.

1086
01:23:05,359 --> 01:23:08,162
[SPEAKER_25]: I will be there signing autographs and taking pictures.

1087
01:23:08,222 --> 01:23:08,702
[SPEAKER_25]: No, I'm kidding.

1088
01:23:08,742 --> 01:23:09,403
[SPEAKER_25]: You guys don't care.

1089
01:23:09,443 --> 01:23:11,244
[SPEAKER_25]: But I do want to meet some of our East Coast listeners.

1090
01:23:11,384 --> 01:23:13,626
[SPEAKER_25]: So if you're in the area, stop on by and say hello.

1091
01:23:13,646 --> 01:23:15,628
[SPEAKER_25]: I have an idea for a game.

1092
01:23:16,248 --> 01:23:16,869
[SPEAKER_25]: It's called Hotline.

1093
01:23:17,145 --> 01:23:19,190
[SPEAKER_25]: Hyper Italian Siblings.

1094
01:23:19,651 --> 01:23:23,800
[SPEAKER_25]: It's basically going to be a platform game starring two funny

1095
01:23:26,718 --> 01:23:34,024
[SPEAKER_25]: and air conditioning repairman and they're going to be saving some chick in the fungus land.

1096
01:23:34,444 --> 01:23:37,587
[SPEAKER_25]: Do you think I'm going to get sued by Nintendo for copying Mario Brothers?

1097
01:23:37,607 --> 01:23:39,529
[SPEAKER_25]: Because it's a completely original idea.

1098
01:23:39,909 --> 01:23:45,093
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm just changing the sprites and everything so it looks nothing like Mario but sort of is Mario.

1099
01:23:45,113 --> 01:23:46,214
[SPEAKER_25]: Loki, it's funny you bring that up.

1100
01:23:46,254 --> 01:23:49,657
[SPEAKER_25]: Have you ever heard of a game on the Commodore 64 called The Great Gianna Sisters?

1101
01:23:50,418 --> 01:23:50,678
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah.

1102
01:23:51,038 --> 01:23:51,999
[SPEAKER_25]: It was basically that.

1103
01:23:54,637 --> 01:24:16,984
[SPEAKER_25]: Except they replaced Mario & Luigi with little spiky haired females and Needless to say Nintendo filed against them and when people compare People always are comparing in the groove and DDR saying it's Street Fighter versus Mortal Kombat right there Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter are both fighting games and in the groove and DDR both dancing games and to me I

1104
01:24:18,474 --> 01:24:22,776
[SPEAKER_25]: When I look at these games, I go, no, it's a little more like Mario and Great Giana Sisters.

1105
01:24:23,437 --> 01:24:25,798
[SPEAKER_25]: You know, Great Giana Sisters had some things that Mario didn't.

1106
01:24:26,078 --> 01:24:28,459
[SPEAKER_25]: Great Giana Sisters has better background music than Mario Bros.

1107
01:24:28,499 --> 01:24:29,560
[SPEAKER_25]: I would go that far to say that.

1108
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:37,344
[SPEAKER_25]: It may not be as memorable to a lot of people, but Great Giana Sisters has a fantastic background music in it, and just a slightly different gameplay.

1109
01:24:37,384 --> 01:24:40,285
[SPEAKER_25]: So the games were slightly different, but not enough.

1110
01:24:40,385 --> 01:24:44,567
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, when you played it, you were still like, wow, this is frickin' Mario Bros.

1111
01:24:44,587 --> 01:24:45,848
[SPEAKER_25]: You know what I was watching today?

1112
01:24:45,868 --> 01:24:46,668
[SPEAKER_25]: I was watching on...

1113
01:24:48,504 --> 01:24:52,366
[SPEAKER_25]: was Nickelodeon Gas, their games in Sports Network or whatever.

1114
01:24:52,426 --> 01:25:00,331
[SPEAKER_25]: They had reruns of Finders Keepers, and one of the grand prizes on there was a Nintendo Entertainment System with the Power Pad.

1115
01:25:02,011 --> 01:25:02,692
[SPEAKER_25]: That is awesome

1116
01:25:20,768 --> 01:25:23,049
[SPEAKER_25]: I was going to say it's time to talk about Paris Hilton.

1117
01:25:23,069 --> 01:25:24,430
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, no.

1118
01:25:24,930 --> 01:25:28,371
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll open the Skype line up for any... We need a new celebrity instead of Paris Hilton.

1119
01:25:28,391 --> 01:25:29,472
[SPEAKER_25]: Lindsay Lohan.

1120
01:25:30,132 --> 01:25:31,233
[SPEAKER_25]: Lindsay Lohan, I agree.

1121
01:25:31,773 --> 01:25:32,173
[SPEAKER_25]: No, no.

1122
01:25:32,833 --> 01:25:34,614
[SPEAKER_25]: How about... That's the point.

1123
01:25:34,954 --> 01:25:36,315
[SPEAKER_25]: We're not going to talk about anybody respectable.

1124
01:25:36,395 --> 01:25:38,776
[SPEAKER_25]: How about Ben Affleck and Jennifer whatever.

1125
01:25:39,516 --> 01:25:41,257
[SPEAKER_25]: They can still call him... Are they back together?

1126
01:25:41,277 --> 01:25:42,737
[SPEAKER_25]: They can still call him Bennifer.

1127
01:25:42,838 --> 01:25:44,078
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, wait, wait.

1128
01:25:44,098 --> 01:25:44,858
[SPEAKER_05]: Are they back together?

1129
01:25:45,018 --> 01:25:46,439
[SPEAKER_25]: That's the new Jennifer.

1130
01:25:46,779 --> 01:25:46,899
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh.

1131
01:25:47,720 --> 01:25:48,380
[SPEAKER_25]: Not J-Lo.

1132
01:25:48,440 --> 01:25:48,560
[SPEAKER_25]: It's

1133
01:25:49,844 --> 01:25:51,305
[SPEAKER_25]: DeepThought42 DeepThought42 I plugged in my headphones

1134
01:26:16,988 --> 01:26:18,789
[SPEAKER_24]: Wonderful bit of technology that that is.

1135
01:26:18,929 --> 01:26:19,289
[SPEAKER_25]: There you go.

1136
01:26:19,309 --> 01:26:20,389
[SPEAKER_25]: That's what I had to do here.

1137
01:26:20,589 --> 01:26:21,229
[SPEAKER_25]: What's on your mind?

1138
01:26:22,089 --> 01:26:22,949
[SPEAKER_24]: Not much.

1139
01:26:23,089 --> 01:26:36,972
[SPEAKER_24]: I sent Jamie an email earlier this week because I was on GameSpot.com and I read an article which is yet another travesty in the world of GTA.

1140
01:26:37,032 --> 01:26:43,353
[SPEAKER_24]: The politicians are ranting on about GTA, the sex mod.

1141
01:26:44,246 --> 01:26:46,230
[SPEAKER_24]: The hot coffee mod that's going around.

1142
01:26:46,390 --> 01:26:47,412
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, I heard about that.

1143
01:26:47,492 --> 01:26:50,679
[SPEAKER_07]: I had the article set aside to actually discuss during the podcast tonight.

1144
01:26:51,568 --> 01:26:52,188
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, okay.

1145
01:26:52,208 --> 01:26:53,028
[SPEAKER_25]: We can touch on it.

1146
01:26:53,048 --> 01:26:54,689
[SPEAKER_25]: We'll get into it in more detail on the podcast.

1147
01:26:54,709 --> 01:26:57,869
[SPEAKER_25]: Does this have to do with, I was reading something about the ESRB.

1148
01:26:58,129 --> 01:26:59,630
[SPEAKER_25]: Their panties are a huge bunch of this.

1149
01:26:59,670 --> 01:27:02,910
[SPEAKER_07]: They're saying that it's violating the integrity of the ESRB.

1150
01:27:03,290 --> 01:27:08,852
[SPEAKER_07]: The thing is, is that the company removed the, you know, it's like when you get a demo out.

1151
01:27:09,632 --> 01:27:14,473
[SPEAKER_07]: My demo of Umjarmalami, for example, has every single stage in it.

1152
01:27:14,733 --> 01:27:15,033
[SPEAKER_07]: It just...

1153
01:27:15,513 --> 01:27:17,455
[SPEAKER_07]: blocks it, reprogram part of the code.

1154
01:27:17,895 --> 01:27:21,678
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's exactly what they did with GTA.

1155
01:27:22,359 --> 01:27:25,722
[SPEAKER_24]: But there are people out there... They would have had to recode the entire game.

1156
01:27:25,762 --> 01:27:27,203
[SPEAKER_24]: It would have pushed it back months.

1157
01:27:29,425 --> 01:27:31,867
[SPEAKER_24]: If they had actually removed it from the game.

1158
01:27:31,927 --> 01:27:33,228
[SPEAKER_24]: It's in the PS2 version.

1159
01:27:33,989 --> 01:27:40,935
[SPEAKER_24]: But instead of pushing it back five months to recode the entire game, they blocked it.

1160
01:27:41,075 --> 01:27:43,537
[SPEAKER_24]: It's not their fault that someone found a way around it.

1161
01:27:43,792 --> 01:27:45,773
[SPEAKER_07]: I give you another example, Bloody War 3.

1162
01:27:46,774 --> 01:27:57,319
[SPEAKER_07]: You remember they had the special photographs hidden in the game, accessible through the debug menu.

1163
01:27:57,439 --> 01:28:00,941
[SPEAKER_25]: That was awesome.

1164
01:28:01,181 --> 01:28:02,041
[SPEAKER_25]: What about the Sims?

1165
01:28:02,121 --> 01:28:04,242
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, you've got the nude patch for the Sims.

1166
01:28:04,302 --> 01:28:05,363
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, that's the same thing.

1167
01:28:06,138 --> 01:28:06,658
[SPEAKER_24]: Exactly.

1168
01:28:07,178 --> 01:28:08,899
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, but the new patch was a patch.

1169
01:28:08,939 --> 01:28:10,459
[SPEAKER_25]: It didn't unlock something that was already there.

1170
01:28:10,479 --> 01:28:11,660
[SPEAKER_25]: Same with the hot coffee mod.

1171
01:28:11,700 --> 01:28:12,360
[SPEAKER_25]: It's a patch.

1172
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:13,160
[SPEAKER_25]: I know.

1173
01:28:13,500 --> 01:28:13,861
[SPEAKER_25]: You know what?

1174
01:28:14,081 --> 01:28:25,725
[SPEAKER_25]: I totally side, and I can't believe I'm siding with Rockstar on something, but I completely side with them on this because if they locked it away and somebody went somewhere they shouldn't have, that's not Rockstar's problem.

1175
01:28:26,145 --> 01:28:29,906
[SPEAKER_25]: And I think the ESRB's issue with this is they're going to look and see if

1176
01:28:30,410 --> 01:28:31,951
[SPEAKER_25]: Were they hiding this?

1177
01:28:31,971 --> 01:28:34,694
[SPEAKER_25]: Were they intentionally hiding this from us when they screwed it?

1178
01:28:34,894 --> 01:28:35,755
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, that's the issue.

1179
01:28:35,875 --> 01:28:36,816
[SPEAKER_25]: And I'm going to say no.

1180
01:28:36,836 --> 01:28:38,177
[SPEAKER_24]: That's the issue that they're looking into.

1181
01:28:38,197 --> 01:28:39,298
[SPEAKER_25]: No, they're not that stupid.

1182
01:28:39,378 --> 01:28:40,879
[SPEAKER_25]: It's only in the PC version.

1183
01:28:40,919 --> 01:28:42,320
[SPEAKER_25]: You can't unlock it in the Xbox.

1184
01:28:42,361 --> 01:28:44,923
[SPEAKER_25]: No, you can unlock it in the PS2 version.

1185
01:28:44,963 --> 01:28:45,383
[SPEAKER_25]: Can you?

1186
01:28:45,483 --> 01:28:46,644
[SPEAKER_24]: It's in the PS2 version.

1187
01:28:47,005 --> 01:28:47,925
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, you can unlock it.

1188
01:28:47,945 --> 01:28:49,727
[SPEAKER_24]: It's incredibly difficult to do, but you can do it.

1189
01:28:50,872 --> 01:28:52,774
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, but is it like a button code you put in?

1190
01:28:53,035 --> 01:28:53,215
[SPEAKER_24]: No.

1191
01:28:53,315 --> 01:28:54,035
[SPEAKER_24]: No, no, no.

1192
01:28:54,096 --> 01:28:56,458
[SPEAKER_24]: You have to download something to your memory stick.

1193
01:28:56,478 --> 01:28:57,078
[SPEAKER_24]: I haven't done it.

1194
01:28:57,359 --> 01:28:59,361
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm not really that interested.

1195
01:28:59,941 --> 01:29:00,402
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, I know.

1196
01:29:00,442 --> 01:29:00,942
[SPEAKER_25]: Exactly.

1197
01:29:00,962 --> 01:29:03,605
[SPEAKER_25]: The blanks people will go to see some titties in their games.

1198
01:29:03,705 --> 01:29:03,965
[SPEAKER_25]: Please.

1199
01:29:04,486 --> 01:29:05,747
[SPEAKER_25]: Go play some Custer's Revenge, people.

1200
01:29:10,282 --> 01:29:10,662
[SPEAKER_25]: You know what?

1201
01:29:11,943 --> 01:29:13,705
[SPEAKER_25]: Right there you're talking about hacking though.

1202
01:29:13,725 --> 01:29:19,770
[SPEAKER_25]: You're going on the internet and you're talking about violating the license agreement when you open the box and buy the game.

1203
01:29:20,210 --> 01:29:23,413
[SPEAKER_25]: The part of the license agreement says you will not fuck with the game.

1204
01:29:23,934 --> 01:29:25,475
[SPEAKER_25]: And you're violating the license agreement.

1205
01:29:25,535 --> 01:29:29,098
[SPEAKER_25]: So I think Rockstar's base is covered and I think through this whole investigation.

1206
01:29:29,118 --> 01:29:38,646
[SPEAKER_24]: And Rockstar has gone through so much shit in the past couple years by fucking parents ruining this country that damn parents

1207
01:29:40,011 --> 01:29:42,597
[SPEAKER_24]: They're not that stupid.

1208
01:29:42,637 --> 01:29:44,581
[SPEAKER_24]: They wouldn't do something like that intentionally.

1209
01:29:44,661 --> 01:29:46,987
[SPEAKER_24]: They saw the minigame and they were like, you know what?

1210
01:29:47,328 --> 01:29:49,513
[SPEAKER_24]: This is crossing a line that we don't even want to cross.

1211
01:29:50,525 --> 01:29:50,945
[SPEAKER_25]: I agree.

1212
01:29:51,046 --> 01:29:53,007
[SPEAKER_25]: I have to side with Rockstar on this one.

1213
01:29:53,047 --> 01:29:55,268
[SPEAKER_25]: I think after the investigation it will be found out this way.

1214
01:29:55,608 --> 01:29:59,571
[SPEAKER_25]: And the angry parents, the parents who are angry over this, lesson learned.

1215
01:29:59,891 --> 01:30:04,113
[SPEAKER_25]: Watch what your fucking kids download on the internet because that's where they're getting this whole thing in the first place.

1216
01:30:04,394 --> 01:30:08,836
[SPEAKER_24]: I have to say, I told Jamie this, but I do in essence agree.

1217
01:30:08,916 --> 01:30:11,178
[SPEAKER_24]: If you read the article, it's all basically this one guy.

1218
01:30:11,198 --> 01:30:12,078
[SPEAKER_24]: His name is Leland Lee.

1219
01:30:12,118 --> 01:30:14,320
[SPEAKER_24]: He's a California assemblyman.

1220
01:30:14,840 --> 01:30:16,441
[SPEAKER_25]: Those California bastards.

1221
01:30:16,861 --> 01:30:17,842
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, I know.

1222
01:30:18,262 --> 01:30:19,783
[SPEAKER_24]: A Democrat from San Francisco.

1223
01:30:19,963 --> 01:30:20,303
[SPEAKER_24]: Damn it.

1224
01:30:23,044 --> 01:30:28,667
[SPEAKER_24]: He has a law in there saying that they do need to overhaul the ESRB.

1225
01:30:28,747 --> 01:30:29,748
[SPEAKER_24]: I do agree with that.

1226
01:30:29,868 --> 01:30:32,949
[SPEAKER_24]: I do think there needs to be a PG-13 rating.

1227
01:30:34,110 --> 01:30:34,930
[SPEAKER_25]: I agree with that, too.

1228
01:30:36,051 --> 01:30:43,055
[SPEAKER_24]: Because you go from Teen, which is like Final Fantasy X, to Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.

1229
01:30:43,115 --> 01:30:43,575
[SPEAKER_24]: That's not...

1230
01:30:44,450 --> 01:30:52,216
[SPEAKER_24]: There needs to be a PG-13, and there needs to be, if you sell an M-rated game to someone under 16, it should be like selling cigarettes to a minor.

1231
01:30:52,236 --> 01:30:53,517
[SPEAKER_24]: It should be the exact same thing.

1232
01:30:54,838 --> 01:30:55,758
[SPEAKER_25]: To an extent, I agree with that.

1233
01:30:55,819 --> 01:31:00,442
[SPEAKER_25]: I think the rules for games should mirror the rules of movies right on down to the rating system.

1234
01:31:00,742 --> 01:31:08,968
[SPEAKER_25]: And as much as an issue as I have with the ratings board sometimes, because they'll give a movie like War of the Worlds, which showed flying bodies.

1235
01:31:09,028 --> 01:31:10,189
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, that movie sucked.

1236
01:31:10,209 --> 01:31:11,130
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, but like flying...

1237
01:31:11,770 --> 01:31:16,731
[SPEAKER_25]: Flying Body Parts and everything, and that movie gets a PG-13, whereas... I like Flying Body Parts.

1238
01:31:16,831 --> 01:31:18,671
[SPEAKER_25]: I know, but still, it should be R-rated.

1239
01:31:18,811 --> 01:31:21,672
[SPEAKER_25]: But you're an adult, and you can enjoy Flying Body Parts whenever you want.

1240
01:31:22,072 --> 01:31:23,632
[SPEAKER_25]: I didn't have a problem with Flying Body Parts.

1241
01:31:23,652 --> 01:31:25,573
[SPEAKER_25]: I liked Flying Body Parts when I was in high school.

1242
01:31:26,433 --> 01:31:26,593
[SPEAKER_25]: Right.

1243
01:31:27,173 --> 01:31:27,713
[SPEAKER_25]: But here's the thing.

1244
01:31:27,753 --> 01:31:29,893
[SPEAKER_25]: Then you take a movie like Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion.

1245
01:31:30,194 --> 01:31:34,494
[SPEAKER_25]: Because they dropped the F-bomb three times in that movie, it gets an R-rating.

1246
01:31:34,874 --> 01:31:36,335
[SPEAKER_25]: There is an inconsistency here.

1247
01:31:37,095 --> 01:31:37,475
[SPEAKER_24]: Exactly.

1248
01:31:37,515 --> 01:31:37,755
[SPEAKER_25]: But...

1249
01:31:38,495 --> 01:31:51,544
[SPEAKER_25]: That problem I have with the MPAA aside, I think the MPAA and the ESRB should work together to be using the same rating system because parents already identify with that PG-13, PGR.

1250
01:31:52,185 --> 01:31:54,366
[SPEAKER_25]: It's already emblazed in their brains.

1251
01:31:54,807 --> 01:31:56,608
[SPEAKER_25]: And so I think they should be just copying that.

1252
01:31:57,468 --> 01:32:00,349
[SPEAKER_24]: It's all going back to singling out video games.

1253
01:32:00,509 --> 01:32:07,392
[SPEAKER_24]: Why are they not going to... Why are they not raging against Rob Zombie's new movie?

1254
01:32:07,472 --> 01:32:09,012
[SPEAKER_24]: Why is it all about video games?

1255
01:32:09,252 --> 01:32:22,637
[SPEAKER_24]: And to me, I think it's... The government is trying to... I mean, not to get all conspiracy theory on you, but I think it's just them trying to say what is art and what is not.

1256
01:32:22,837 --> 01:32:25,978
[SPEAKER_24]: And they're trying to say that if it's not art, then they can ban it.

1257
01:32:28,158 --> 01:32:31,100
[SPEAKER_24]: Am I totally out of... No, I'm with you.

1258
01:32:31,320 --> 01:32:32,581
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm with you to a point here.

1259
01:32:32,762 --> 01:32:33,282
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm with you.

1260
01:32:34,984 --> 01:32:35,184
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah.

1261
01:32:35,944 --> 01:32:36,445
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know.

1262
01:32:36,525 --> 01:32:52,138
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, that's just my... I mean, that may be a little too conspiracy theory, but I mean, between that and the flag-burning amendment and the fact that our president is going to be electing... is going to be appointing not only a Supreme Court justice, but a chief justice, all that stuff scares me right now.

1263
01:32:52,519 --> 01:32:52,539
[SPEAKER_25]: I...

1264
01:32:53,803 --> 01:32:57,627
[SPEAKER_25]: As someone who didn't vote for our president, I can say it kind of scares me too.

1265
01:32:58,908 --> 01:33:01,050
[SPEAKER_24]: We need to march on Washington from this shit.

1266
01:33:01,090 --> 01:33:05,295
[SPEAKER_24]: We need to go to fucking Lafayette Park with a can of caffeine.

1267
01:33:06,346 --> 01:33:08,128
[SPEAKER_24]: A bunch of flags and just be like, fuck you.

1268
01:33:08,168 --> 01:33:09,729
[SPEAKER_24]: Someone has to do something.

1269
01:33:27,353 --> 01:33:34,880
[SPEAKER_25]: I think parents of the world could stand to be educated on this issue a little bit more, but I think to an extent, I think the games should be mirroring the movies a little bit.

1270
01:33:35,140 --> 01:33:41,186
[SPEAKER_25]: Because society, for whatever reason, we have this movie thing emblazoned in our head, but for video games, we treat it differently.

1271
01:33:41,486 --> 01:33:43,708
[SPEAKER_25]: And for some parents, video games are the babysitter.

1272
01:33:44,889 --> 01:33:45,110
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah.

1273
01:33:45,510 --> 01:33:46,231
[SPEAKER_25]: And it's just different.

1274
01:33:46,331 --> 01:33:46,611
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know.

1275
01:33:46,631 --> 01:33:48,172
[SPEAKER_24]: And for some parents, television is a babysitter.

1276
01:33:48,212 --> 01:33:49,954
[SPEAKER_24]: Have you ever watched, like, CSI?

1277
01:33:49,974 --> 01:33:50,855
[SPEAKER_24]: Have you ever watched, like...

1278
01:33:51,559 --> 01:33:54,221
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, just because they don't swear doesn't mean it's not graphic.

1279
01:33:54,281 --> 01:33:55,401
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, that's disturbing shit.

1280
01:33:55,421 --> 01:33:59,884
[SPEAKER_25]: Me personally, no, I haven't watched CSI, but I have watched other shows that are just as bad.

1281
01:34:00,264 --> 01:34:04,487
[SPEAKER_25]: In fact, I was watching a show the other day that they said shit on it, and I was like, wow.

1282
01:34:04,527 --> 01:34:05,247
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, I didn't care.

1283
01:34:05,287 --> 01:34:05,787
[SPEAKER_25]: I thought it was funny.

1284
01:34:05,827 --> 01:34:07,088
[SPEAKER_24]: They said shit on Friends.

1285
01:34:07,649 --> 01:34:08,129
Did they?

1286
01:34:08,149 --> 01:34:10,670
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, I missed that.

1287
01:34:11,631 --> 01:34:14,653
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, it was one of... I can't believe I know this.

1288
01:34:14,813 --> 01:34:18,455
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm mildly embarrassing myself that I know this, but...

1289
01:34:19,083 --> 01:34:19,583
[SPEAKER_24]: I remember it.

1290
01:34:19,623 --> 01:34:26,687
[SPEAKER_24]: It was one of the episodes where, you know, Rachel and Ross had a little, you know, confrontation and Rachel says, I'm sick of this shit.

1291
01:34:27,667 --> 01:34:29,008
[SPEAKER_25]: Wow, I wonder how that got by censors.

1292
01:34:29,228 --> 01:34:36,652
[SPEAKER_25]: Anyway, DarkSakura, I know you've got to have a comment on this because you're usually pretty passionate about these issues, so I'm curious what you think on this.

1293
01:34:36,852 --> 01:34:41,815
[SPEAKER_07]: It's more of a case of parents being stupid shits and not doing their goddamn job.

1294
01:34:42,555 --> 01:34:42,975
[SPEAKER_15]: Amen.

1295
01:34:43,135 --> 01:34:44,136
[SPEAKER_07]: It comes down to that.

1296
01:34:45,296 --> 01:34:46,617
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we...

1297
01:34:47,765 --> 01:34:57,994
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very sad that the state that our country has become, where we supposedly have all this freedom, and I actually have to sort of quote George Carlin last night.

1298
01:34:59,428 --> 01:35:01,610
[SPEAKER_07]: We used to be the land of the free.

1299
01:35:01,710 --> 01:35:03,532
[SPEAKER_07]: We used to have all these rights.

1300
01:35:03,892 --> 01:35:05,613
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember when we could do this.

1301
01:35:05,753 --> 01:35:07,775
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, you know, that's pretty true.

1302
01:35:07,795 --> 01:35:17,162
[SPEAKER_07]: Because now, you know, it's like you and I were discussing previously with my comment about being arrested at protesting.

1303
01:35:17,182 --> 01:35:22,025
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't matter if you've got, you know, a license to be there.

1304
01:35:22,726 --> 01:35:26,649
[SPEAKER_07]: If it's anything that's against the current administration, your ass will get locked up.

1305
01:35:27,950 --> 01:35:29,852
[SPEAKER_07]: You know where else they did that?

1306
01:35:31,293 --> 01:35:34,095
[SPEAKER_07]: Good number of countries that were under dictatorship rule, huh?

1307
01:35:34,916 --> 01:35:35,316
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, I know.

1308
01:35:35,656 --> 01:35:37,938
[SPEAKER_24]: No, I totally agree with you.

1309
01:35:37,998 --> 01:35:42,082
[SPEAKER_24]: But I keep going back to the South Park movie, Blame Canada.

1310
01:35:43,103 --> 01:35:43,783
[SPEAKER_24]: You know that song?

1311
01:35:45,244 --> 01:35:46,145
[SPEAKER_24]: That's all this crap.

1312
01:35:46,365 --> 01:35:52,090
[SPEAKER_24]: And all the freedoms that we have, all the things are being taken away.

1313
01:35:52,390 --> 01:35:54,292
[SPEAKER_24]: This country was perfect before Nintendo came along.

1314
01:35:54,975 --> 01:36:00,702
[SPEAKER_07]: We've gone from being ultimate right wing to uber leftist and it's all a bunch of bullshit.

1315
01:36:16,327 --> 01:36:18,849
[SPEAKER_24]: I still say we do a Million Gamer March.

1316
01:36:18,869 --> 01:36:19,789
[SPEAKER_24]: We started here.

1317
01:36:20,169 --> 01:36:21,570
[SPEAKER_25]: I say we form our own planet.

1318
01:36:22,551 --> 01:36:25,573
[SPEAKER_25]: I think the Million Gamer March is a freaking brilliant idea.

1319
01:36:25,913 --> 01:36:27,354
[SPEAKER_25]: We just need to organize.

1320
01:36:27,734 --> 01:36:29,395
[SPEAKER_07]: But they're all too busy playing EverQuest.

1321
01:36:29,475 --> 01:36:31,797
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm here, East Coast representation, jersey in the house.

1322
01:36:31,937 --> 01:36:34,018
[SPEAKER_25]: I will, you know.

1323
01:36:34,138 --> 01:36:40,322
[SPEAKER_25]: But knowing the gamer community, we'll try to organize ourselves and then we'll be all, ooh, new Halo.

1324
01:36:41,983 --> 01:36:43,163
[SPEAKER_25]: Too busy, gotta go play games.

1325
01:36:43,203 --> 01:36:45,485
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll be marching with our DSs and PSPs.

1326
01:36:46,337 --> 01:36:48,279
[SPEAKER_25]: Hooray, I'll finally be able to find a PictoChat room.

1327
01:36:48,619 --> 01:36:48,899
[SPEAKER_07]: Ha!

1328
01:36:49,500 --> 01:36:51,181
[SPEAKER_25]: I haven't found one since E3.

1329
01:36:51,421 --> 01:36:51,721
[SPEAKER_25]: All right.

1330
01:36:52,042 --> 01:36:54,444
[SPEAKER_25]: All right, we've got to let you go, but thank you so much for calling in.

1331
01:36:54,464 --> 01:36:55,304
[SPEAKER_23]: This was a good topic.

1332
01:36:56,005 --> 01:36:56,525
[SPEAKER_25]: All right, dude.

1333
01:36:56,745 --> 01:36:56,986
[SPEAKER_25]: All right.

1334
01:36:57,266 --> 01:36:57,866
[SPEAKER_25]: Have a good one, buddy.

1335
01:36:57,926 --> 01:36:58,147
[SPEAKER_25]: Bye.

1336
01:36:58,247 --> 01:36:58,467
[SPEAKER_25]: Bye.

1337
01:36:59,828 --> 01:37:00,128
[SPEAKER_23]: All right.

1338
01:37:00,588 --> 01:37:01,109
[SPEAKER_25]: That was good.

1339
01:37:01,369 --> 01:37:01,890
[SPEAKER_25]: I like that.

1340
01:37:02,030 --> 01:37:04,892
[SPEAKER_25]: Even though that was a more general video gaming issue, you know what?

1341
01:37:05,112 --> 01:37:09,075
[SPEAKER_25]: I think we can do what we want on this program, and we'll talk about that.

1342
01:37:09,115 --> 01:37:10,036
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what we're about.

1343
01:37:10,116 --> 01:37:10,597
[SPEAKER_25]: That's right.

1344
01:37:11,277 --> 01:37:11,577
[SPEAKER_25]: All right.

1345
01:37:12,258 --> 01:37:13,038
[SPEAKER_25]: I need some light in here.

1346
01:37:13,058 --> 01:37:13,899
[SPEAKER_25]: It's getting kind of dark.

1347
01:37:14,520 --> 01:37:14,860
[SPEAKER_25]: All right.

1348
01:37:15,585 --> 01:37:16,586
[SPEAKER_25]: I think we're going to go to a break.

1349
01:37:16,626 --> 01:37:17,446
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm kind of angry.

1350
01:37:17,526 --> 01:37:19,287
[SPEAKER_25]: So I want to hear some Taku because I'm angry.

1351
01:37:19,507 --> 01:37:20,768
[SPEAKER_25]: And when I'm angry, I listen to Taku.

1352
01:37:20,808 --> 01:37:21,288
[SPEAKER_06]: Lots of Taku.

1353
01:37:21,468 --> 01:37:21,748
[SPEAKER_25]: All right.

1354
01:37:21,788 --> 01:37:28,412
[SPEAKER_25]: So we're going to hear some Taku along with some other 2DX songs because after Taku, to offset it, I have a little lovey song.

1355
01:37:28,432 --> 01:37:29,572
[SPEAKER_25]: I have a lovey-dovey song.

1356
01:37:29,893 --> 01:37:30,113
[SPEAKER_25]: All right.

1357
01:37:30,133 --> 01:37:33,514
[SPEAKER_25]: So we'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio and tonight's Cage Match.

1358
01:37:33,594 --> 01:37:35,095
[SPEAKER_25]: More news, etc., etc., etc.

1359
01:39:50,036 --> 01:39:50,498
Thanks for watching!

1360
01:41:20,922 --> 01:41:21,644
Music Playing...

1361
01:43:33,303 --> 01:43:34,344
Thanks for watching!

1362
01:43:57,664 --> 01:43:58,505
Thanks for watching!

1363
01:45:11,461 --> 01:45:20,809
[SPEAKER_21]: And now, let's listen in to an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting as they debate some of the new programming coming to Orange Lounge Radio.

1364
01:45:21,551 --> 01:45:25,655
[SPEAKER_25]: Jamie, I have a suggestion about some of the music in our Bomani Music and More program.

1365
01:45:25,675 --> 01:45:26,636
[SPEAKER_25]: Can we talk about that?

1366
01:45:26,916 --> 01:45:29,258
[SPEAKER_18]: No subject will ever be taboo.

1367
01:45:29,559 --> 01:45:33,182
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, I was thinking maybe we should move Pump Up the Volume from Tuesday Nights.

1368
01:45:33,722 --> 01:45:36,265
[SPEAKER_25]: Except, of course, a subject that was just under discussion.

1369
01:45:36,765 --> 01:45:42,110
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, well, what would you think if maybe we cut back on some of the tack music we play on the station?

1370
01:45:42,671 --> 01:45:43,952
[SPEAKER_11]: I collect your fucking head.

1371
01:45:45,894 --> 01:45:47,395
[SPEAKER_10]: Just like this fucker here.

1372
01:45:48,496 --> 01:45:52,178
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my god, why did you do that to Loki?

1373
01:45:52,459 --> 01:45:55,821
[SPEAKER_09]: The holic thing on episode 69 was just a joke!

1374
01:45:56,782 --> 01:46:03,226
[SPEAKER_09]: Now if any of you sons of bitches got anything else to say, now's the fucking time!

1375
01:46:04,447 --> 01:46:08,169
[SPEAKER_20]: Orange Lounge Radio, where everybody has a say.

1376
01:46:12,365 --> 01:46:13,086
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

1377
01:46:13,566 --> 01:46:15,087
[SPEAKER_07]: I really sound a lot like Lucy Liu there.

1378
01:46:16,108 --> 01:46:17,429
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a really good voice actor.

1379
01:46:17,469 --> 01:46:18,750
[SPEAKER_25]: You're brilliant voice actors.

1380
01:46:20,671 --> 01:46:25,355
[SPEAKER_25]: Chat room is yelling about the speaking of new programming.

1381
01:46:26,935 --> 01:46:31,057
[SPEAKER_25]: There was a post on our community earlier this week that said there was going to be a new show on Friday night.

1382
01:46:32,078 --> 01:46:33,919
[SPEAKER_25]: That was what we call a miscommunication.

1383
01:46:34,239 --> 01:46:36,521
[SPEAKER_25]: A little miscommunication between two parties.

1384
01:46:37,401 --> 01:46:39,863
[SPEAKER_25]: But at least you know that we're working on something.

1385
01:46:39,963 --> 01:46:41,784
[SPEAKER_25]: So we're not just resting on our laurels.

1386
01:46:42,124 --> 01:46:46,346
[SPEAKER_25]: There is new programming being under discussion for Orange Lounge Radio as we speak.

1387
01:46:47,307 --> 01:46:48,528
[SPEAKER_25]: So we will see what occurs.

1388
01:46:48,588 --> 01:46:49,448
[SPEAKER_25]: And there's not just that.

1389
01:46:49,488 --> 01:46:52,810
[SPEAKER_25]: I know of at least three projects being worked on right now.

1390
01:46:53,031 --> 01:46:54,952
[SPEAKER_07]: Just in short, chat room.

1391
01:46:55,172 --> 01:46:55,372
[SPEAKER_25]: Mm-hmm.

1392
01:46:56,292 --> 01:46:59,494
[SPEAKER_07]: Unless it's me or Rob or Loki that posts it.

1393
01:47:00,434 --> 01:47:00,814
[SPEAKER_07]: Question.

1394
01:47:02,275 --> 01:47:04,276
[SPEAKER_25]: Unfortunately, yeah, you've got to kind of go with that rule.

1395
01:47:04,756 --> 01:47:05,517
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1396
01:47:06,457 --> 01:47:09,979
[SPEAKER_07]: Neither of us post it or it's not listed in there.

1397
01:47:09,999 --> 01:47:11,100
[SPEAKER_07]: Or the website.

1398
01:47:11,440 --> 01:47:11,620
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

1399
01:47:11,720 --> 01:47:12,840
[SPEAKER_07]: Or we don't confirm it.

1400
01:47:13,861 --> 01:47:14,141
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't.

1401
01:47:15,122 --> 01:47:15,302
[SPEAKER_25]: No.

1402
01:47:15,522 --> 01:47:17,103
[SPEAKER_07]: Not until one of us has confirmed it.

1403
01:47:17,203 --> 01:47:18,283
[SPEAKER_25]: OrangeLawnTrader.com, too.

1404
01:47:18,383 --> 01:47:22,225
[SPEAKER_25]: As much as we love the live journal community, OrangeLawnTrader.com, too, is a great site to get all the latest news.

1405
01:47:22,265 --> 01:47:22,385
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah.

1406
01:47:24,622 --> 01:47:25,743
[SPEAKER_25]: Hey, Loki, turn off the damn game.

1407
01:47:25,763 --> 01:47:26,503
[SPEAKER_25]: We're doing a show here.

1408
01:47:54,540 --> 01:47:56,141
[SPEAKER_25]: It's not the goddamn game, bastard.

1409
01:47:58,902 --> 01:48:04,826
[SPEAKER_25]: In the groove, the game we've been talking about earlier today with the whole lawsuit business, they're still trucking along.

1410
01:48:05,286 --> 01:48:09,668
[SPEAKER_25]: They have a very interesting thing going on right now, the Worldwide Road Rally 2005.

1411
01:48:10,249 --> 01:48:21,395
[SPEAKER_25]: And if you want more information on this Road Rally 2005, you can visit rocksorgames.com slash roadrally slash, well, I'm looking, it's just rocksorgames.com slash roadrally.

1412
01:48:21,455 --> 01:48:23,716
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm specifically looking at the events page right now.

1413
01:48:24,950 --> 01:48:27,953
[SPEAKER_25]: 8 events that they're trying to get people to compete in.

1414
01:48:27,973 --> 01:48:30,455
[SPEAKER_25]: And this is like a nationwide tournament.

1415
01:48:30,475 --> 01:48:33,217
[SPEAKER_25]: I think this is their attempt at doing some type of nationwide tournament.

1416
01:48:33,257 --> 01:48:34,638
[SPEAKER_25]: Listen to the kinds of things they have here.

1417
01:48:35,599 --> 01:48:37,360
[SPEAKER_25]: Most locations played.

1418
01:48:37,840 --> 01:48:41,903
[SPEAKER_25]: And you have to prove this by copying down ITG serial numbers.

1419
01:48:42,984 --> 01:48:47,067
[SPEAKER_25]: Most unique locations, which again I think is serial numbers.

1420
01:48:47,568 --> 01:48:49,389
[SPEAKER_25]: Total distance traveled.

1421
01:48:49,790 --> 01:48:52,111
[SPEAKER_25]: How far did you go to visit locations?

1422
01:48:52,171 --> 01:48:52,512
[SPEAKER_25]: Now see...

1423
01:48:53,332 --> 01:48:57,913
[SPEAKER_25]: I might be able to win this because I'm going to be going to the East Coast on a trip and I might play in the group too out there.

1424
01:48:57,973 --> 01:48:59,413
[SPEAKER_25]: So maybe I should start looking for a team.

1425
01:49:01,054 --> 01:49:04,915
[SPEAKER_25]: Best marathon score, best team photo.

1426
01:49:06,235 --> 01:49:08,375
[SPEAKER_25]: You email them a photo and if they like it, you win.

1427
01:49:08,955 --> 01:49:16,037
[SPEAKER_25]: Best freestyle, best costume, and best overall most hardcore ITG freak.

1428
01:49:16,937 --> 01:49:17,957
[SPEAKER_25]: Is that grammatically correct?

1429
01:49:18,057 --> 01:49:20,538
[SPEAKER_25]: Best overall most hardcore ITG freak?

1430
01:49:20,638 --> 01:49:20,938
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know.

1431
01:49:21,607 --> 01:49:25,350
[SPEAKER_25]: Regardless, if that interests you, head on over to rockstoregames.com slash roadrally.

1432
01:49:25,791 --> 01:49:33,418
[SPEAKER_25]: Kind of interesting, the idea of a national DDR tournament using pictures or video has been something toyed on for quite some time.

1433
01:49:33,458 --> 01:49:37,802
[SPEAKER_25]: So it's very interesting, I think anyway, that the company who puts out in the groove is endorsing this.

1434
01:49:38,682 --> 01:49:39,443
[SPEAKER_25]: Loki, your thoughts?

1435
01:49:39,483 --> 01:49:40,284
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm sure you have some.

1436
01:49:42,005 --> 01:49:44,027
[SPEAKER_25]: I guess it's a good idea, whatever.

1437
01:49:44,107 --> 01:49:45,188
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, where are the prizes?

1438
01:49:46,830 --> 01:49:47,570
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, I didn't even look.

1439
01:49:47,811 --> 01:49:48,151
[SPEAKER_25]: Let's see.

1440
01:49:50,146 --> 01:49:51,107
[SPEAKER_25]: Bad Rob, bad.

1441
01:49:51,127 --> 01:49:51,627
[SPEAKER_25]: Sorry.

1442
01:49:52,487 --> 01:49:53,248
[SPEAKER_08]: For shame.

1443
01:49:53,508 --> 01:49:54,328
[SPEAKER_25]: Trophies.

1444
01:49:55,629 --> 01:50:04,593
[SPEAKER_25]: Overall, most hardcore ITG freak gets two round trip tickets to Las Vegas for the North American tournament finals.

1445
01:50:04,913 --> 01:50:05,574
[SPEAKER_25]: You get tribbles.

1446
01:50:06,834 --> 01:50:10,136
[SPEAKER_25]: Most locations get up to three packages for the winning team.

1447
01:50:10,196 --> 01:50:16,579
[SPEAKER_25]: You basically get like a Megamix CD, a red octane ignition pad, a signed copy of In the Groove, and participation in the lawsuit.

1448
01:50:18,220 --> 01:50:18,680
[SPEAKER_25]: You're bad.

1449
01:50:19,521 --> 01:50:19,621
[SPEAKER_25]: Um...

1450
01:50:20,322 --> 01:50:21,623
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm trying to look at what else they have here.

1451
01:50:21,643 --> 01:50:25,506
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't see a whole lot of... Basically signed copies of In the Groove seem to be the big prizes.

1452
01:50:25,806 --> 01:50:28,769
[SPEAKER_25]: Some other Red Octane goodies thrown in there for good measure as well.

1453
01:50:29,789 --> 01:50:31,971
[SPEAKER_25]: They're nothing to laugh at.

1454
01:50:32,011 --> 01:50:32,672
[SPEAKER_25]: They're kind of neat.

1455
01:50:32,772 --> 01:50:37,315
[SPEAKER_25]: Especially if you're a true ITG freak, then a signed copy of the game should get a rise out of you.

1456
01:50:37,756 --> 01:50:39,477
[SPEAKER_25]: Especially that Las Vegas thing.

1457
01:50:39,657 --> 01:50:41,859
[SPEAKER_25]: That's a pretty good one there.

1458
01:50:42,960 --> 01:50:43,640
[SPEAKER_22]: And trophies!

1459
01:50:43,920 --> 01:50:44,601
[SPEAKER_22]: Who loves trophies?

1460
01:50:48,595 --> 01:50:52,998
[SPEAKER_07]: I drove to play a shitty game and all I got was this stupid trophy.

1461
01:50:53,719 --> 01:50:55,520
[SPEAKER_07]: The trophy has a big dunce cap on it.

1462
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:57,602
[SPEAKER_25]: Posers!

1463
01:51:16,468 --> 01:51:18,208
[SPEAKER_25]: By the way, I'm being yelled at in the chat room.

1464
01:51:18,248 --> 01:51:21,769
[SPEAKER_25]: This is the worldwide rally, not just the national.

1465
01:51:22,089 --> 01:51:22,929
[SPEAKER_25]: I forgot Canada.

1466
01:51:22,989 --> 01:51:24,990
[SPEAKER_25]: Sorry, because I know we have Canadian listeners.

1467
01:51:25,110 --> 01:51:25,630
[SPEAKER_25]: I forgot.

1468
01:51:27,050 --> 01:51:28,871
[SPEAKER_25]: You're all really close to the border anyway, right?

1469
01:51:28,911 --> 01:51:29,311
[SPEAKER_25]: No, I'm kidding.

1470
01:51:30,411 --> 01:51:31,111
[SPEAKER_25]: It's worldwide.

1471
01:51:31,431 --> 01:51:33,292
[SPEAKER_25]: Do they have ITG machines in Australia?

1472
01:51:33,472 --> 01:51:36,472
[SPEAKER_25]: I think there's one in Australia, one in Europe, so it's worldwide.

1473
01:51:37,472 --> 01:51:44,494
[SPEAKER_25]: If you're in Europe and you're freaking crazy enough to come to the States and play machines so you can win this contest, hey, more power to you.

1474
01:51:45,405 --> 01:51:46,325
[SPEAKER_25]: More power to you.

1475
01:51:47,766 --> 01:51:48,226
[SPEAKER_25]: Who cares?

1476
01:51:48,426 --> 01:51:49,166
[SPEAKER_25]: Honestly, I don't.

1477
01:51:49,726 --> 01:51:53,287
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, I think the whole concept is what's neat, despite how you feel about the game.

1478
01:51:53,427 --> 01:51:57,928
[SPEAKER_25]: The fact that the company is endorsing it and is going to fly people to Las Vegas, that's kind of neat to me.

1479
01:51:58,909 --> 01:52:00,909
[SPEAKER_25]: And they might not be able to when they're broke.

1480
01:52:01,369 --> 01:52:01,910
Stop.

1481
01:52:02,410 --> 01:52:03,550
[SPEAKER_25]: After the lawsuit.

1482
01:52:06,051 --> 01:52:06,411
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright.

1483
01:52:06,431 --> 01:52:07,591
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm going to laugh if that happens.

1484
01:52:08,251 --> 01:52:09,552
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm the most hardcore.

1485
01:52:09,712 --> 01:52:11,472
[SPEAKER_25]: I drove all around the country.

1486
01:52:11,492 --> 01:52:12,192
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, but we went under.

1487
01:52:15,492 --> 01:52:17,653
[SPEAKER_25]: Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match Sound good?

1488
01:52:47,628 --> 01:52:51,994
[SPEAKER_25]: The way the cage match works, we play three songs for your listening pleasure.

1489
01:52:52,355 --> 01:52:54,918
[SPEAKER_25]: One song selected by each host.

1490
01:52:55,439 --> 01:52:59,425
[SPEAKER_25]: And the winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's

1491
01:52:59,853 --> 01:53:04,656
[SPEAKER_25]: Avani Music and More Program, which plays 24 hours a day, 7 days a week on this station.

1492
01:53:04,836 --> 01:53:05,977
[SPEAKER_25]: We are not live.

1493
01:53:06,598 --> 01:53:11,901
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright, you only get to hear a clip of last week's winner, though, because it already won last week, so you've already heard it.

1494
01:53:12,281 --> 01:53:14,683
[SPEAKER_25]: So last week in the Cage Mash, we had a brand new winner.

1495
01:53:15,423 --> 01:53:16,144
[SPEAKER_25]: Thanks for watching!

1496
01:54:04,381 --> 01:54:05,382
Thank you for watching!

1497
01:54:32,119 --> 01:54:33,523
Thank you for watching!

1498
01:55:16,719 --> 01:55:21,721
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright, that was a clip of song number one, The Azoic, with Let Me Tell You Something.

1499
01:55:22,301 --> 01:55:31,045
[SPEAKER_25]: And let me tell you something, that song is going for its second win tonight, so we'll see if that'll win, or if one of these two new songs will dethrone The Azoic.

1500
01:55:31,325 --> 01:55:32,926
[SPEAKER_25]: We'll start it off with Loki's pick tonight.

1501
01:55:32,966 --> 01:55:34,947
[SPEAKER_25]: Loki, what did you choose for our lucky listeners?

1502
01:55:35,587 --> 01:55:39,089
[SPEAKER_25]: I chose a song called Wraith, because it's awesome.

1503
01:55:39,929 --> 01:55:43,270
[SPEAKER_25]: And it's also a new MIDI head track, so... Oh, okay.

1504
01:55:43,470 --> 01:55:43,971
[SPEAKER_25]: Goody, goody.

1505
01:55:44,051 --> 01:55:44,431
[SPEAKER_25]: Here we go.

1506
01:55:45,194 --> 01:55:48,899
[SPEAKER_25]: Monolithic with Wraith Monolithic with Wraith

1507
01:58:53,297 --> 01:58:53,858
Thanks for watching!

1508
02:00:27,223 --> 02:00:28,683
Thank you for watching!

1509
02:01:10,213 --> 02:01:10,842
Thanks for watching!

1510
02:01:55,740 --> 02:01:56,661
Thanks for watching!

1511
02:02:29,665 --> 02:02:34,107
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, that was song number two, Monolithic, with Wraith.

1512
02:02:34,487 --> 02:02:39,170
[SPEAKER_25]: Let's go around and see if it was good or bad, according to us.

1513
02:02:39,550 --> 02:02:40,330
[SPEAKER_25]: DarkSakura.

1514
02:02:40,650 --> 02:02:42,851
[SPEAKER_07]: It sounds like what I'd... I can't hear myself again.

1515
02:02:43,792 --> 02:02:47,514
[SPEAKER_07]: It sounds like what I would hear at the goth club I go to.

1516
02:02:47,534 --> 02:02:52,776
[SPEAKER_07]: So, in that sense, it's pretty generic, and I still don't really care for his singing.

1517
02:02:53,276 --> 02:02:58,599
[SPEAKER_07]: I like the song overall, but it's pretty generic, so I give it about a seven.

1518
02:02:59,759 --> 02:03:00,120
[SPEAKER_25]: Loki.

1519
02:03:00,721 --> 02:03:09,132
[SPEAKER_25]: It's a 10 because it reminds me a lot of, especially with the end part, a lot of Enigmas type stuff where they have very atmospheric and stuff.

1520
02:03:09,753 --> 02:03:13,678
[SPEAKER_25]: And if this is a good reflection of what the album's going to be like, it'll be really good.

1521
02:03:13,998 --> 02:03:15,300
[SPEAKER_25]: By the way, new album coming out soon.

1522
02:03:15,600 --> 02:03:15,801
[SPEAKER_25]: Bye.

1523
02:03:18,510 --> 02:03:19,972
[SPEAKER_25]: And what... Oh, you gave it to him.

1524
02:03:20,652 --> 02:03:23,855
[SPEAKER_25]: Atmospheric is a very good word to describe that song.

1525
02:03:23,875 --> 02:03:32,684
[SPEAKER_25]: And you know what's interesting is I think that song has me convinced more than anything that Midihead should really try to see if he can't do, like, music scores for video games.

1526
02:03:33,205 --> 02:03:38,230
[SPEAKER_25]: Because I think if he coupled up with the right gaming company, they could do a sweet soundtrack for a game.

1527
02:03:38,930 --> 02:03:39,010
[SPEAKER_25]: Um...

1528
02:03:39,731 --> 02:03:40,712
[SPEAKER_25]: I'd have to second that.

1529
02:03:41,672 --> 02:03:42,253
[SPEAKER_25]: I really do.

1530
02:03:42,593 --> 02:03:43,193
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know why.

1531
02:03:43,274 --> 02:03:56,382
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, DDR is one thing, but he really, like, if the rumors are true and he's not into the album making things so much anymore, he really ought to think about doing the video game scoring because I could hear that kind of music in a game like Devil May Cry or something.

1532
02:03:56,402 --> 02:03:56,702
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know.

1533
02:03:56,763 --> 02:03:57,763
[SPEAKER_25]: I just think it would kick ass.

1534
02:03:57,783 --> 02:04:01,165
[SPEAKER_25]: Or even, like, he does a lot of good instrumental stuff even just for other things.

1535
02:04:01,185 --> 02:04:01,486
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.

1536
02:04:01,506 --> 02:04:02,126
[SPEAKER_25]: Like media stuff.

1537
02:04:02,166 --> 02:04:05,148
[SPEAKER_25]: Seriously, gaming companies, look this guy up.

1538
02:04:05,188 --> 02:04:05,969
[SPEAKER_25]: Middyhead.com.

1539
02:04:05,989 --> 02:04:06,969
[SPEAKER_25]: He should score your game.

1540
02:04:07,670 --> 02:04:09,231
[SPEAKER_25]: As for the song itself, Stand Alone...

1541
02:04:11,236 --> 02:04:14,018
[SPEAKER_25]: It's kind of a little too atmospheric to be a standalone song for me.

1542
02:04:14,058 --> 02:04:16,999
[SPEAKER_25]: I think it's the type of song I'd enjoy more on the scope of an album.

1543
02:04:17,420 --> 02:04:20,402
[SPEAKER_25]: So in that sense, if that is the song on the album, I'm looking forward to the album.

1544
02:04:20,422 --> 02:04:22,483
[SPEAKER_25]: But the song itself, I'm not so hot on.

1545
02:04:22,703 --> 02:04:24,524
[SPEAKER_25]: So I'll stop talking and give it a 7.5.

1546
02:04:25,725 --> 02:04:25,985
[SPEAKER_25]: Angel.

1547
02:04:28,427 --> 02:04:28,807
[SPEAKER_06]: I liked it.

1548
02:04:28,827 --> 02:04:29,407
[SPEAKER_06]: It was pretty good.

1549
02:04:30,828 --> 02:04:35,451
[SPEAKER_06]: Midhead's always been a plus in my book as far as music talent and stuff.

1550
02:04:35,511 --> 02:04:36,712
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'll give it an 8.

1551
02:04:37,705 --> 02:04:39,386
[SPEAKER_25]: I put the wrong song in.

1552
02:04:39,486 --> 02:04:44,167
[SPEAKER_25]: I meant to copy what I put in there to a different folder and ended up copying the wrong song.

1553
02:04:44,187 --> 02:04:45,027
[SPEAKER_25]: But hey, it's a good song.

1554
02:04:45,147 --> 02:04:48,048
[SPEAKER_25]: I like that it makes fun of clubs, yet it's played at clubs everywhere.

1555
02:04:48,108 --> 02:04:49,208
[SPEAKER_25]: So it's a blur, girls and boys.

1556
02:05:03,004 --> 02:05:03,804
[SPEAKER_25]: No Bit of Blur!

1557
02:05:04,065 --> 02:05:04,845
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright, I like Blur.

1558
02:05:04,885 --> 02:05:05,605
[SPEAKER_25]: Let's check this out.

1559
02:05:05,645 --> 02:05:07,226
[SPEAKER_25]: Blur with Girls and Boys.

1560
02:05:07,246 --> 02:05:08,007
[SPEAKER_25]: We'll be back after this.

1561
02:05:38,435 --> 02:05:45,037
[SPEAKER_09]: Streets like a jungle, so call the police Following the herd, down to Greece Unharmed at night

1562
02:06:06,940 --> 02:06:08,681
Thank you for watching!

1563
02:06:36,764 --> 02:06:37,945
Thank you for watching.

1564
02:06:38,005 --> 02:06:39,726
See you next time.

1565
02:06:56,716 --> 02:06:59,461
Thank you for watching

1566
02:07:48,477 --> 02:08:00,984
[SPEAKER_15]: Looking for girls who are boys, who like boys To be girls who did boys like they girls Who did girls like they boys Always should be someone you really like

1567
02:08:14,432 --> 02:08:16,193
Thank you for watching!

1568
02:09:26,283 --> 02:09:31,707
[SPEAKER_25]: Song number three in tonight's cage match, Blur with Girls and Boys, DarkSakura.

1569
02:09:31,727 --> 02:09:32,408
[SPEAKER_25]: What'd you think of that one?

1570
02:09:32,588 --> 02:09:33,408
[SPEAKER_25]: Ten, it's Blur.

1571
02:09:35,330 --> 02:09:35,950
[SPEAKER_25]: How did I guess?

1572
02:09:36,451 --> 02:09:37,031
[SPEAKER_25]: Uh, Loki.

1573
02:09:38,532 --> 02:09:38,632
[SPEAKER_25]: Ah!

1574
02:09:39,553 --> 02:09:40,093
[SPEAKER_25]: Little steppy.

1575
02:09:40,314 --> 02:09:41,434
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, anyway.

1576
02:09:42,816 --> 02:09:45,117
[SPEAKER_25]: You know, I like the remix of the song a lot.

1577
02:09:45,257 --> 02:09:48,660
[SPEAKER_25]: You know, the remix of the song, I give it ten, but that was just, it felt like something was missing.

1578
02:09:49,614 --> 02:09:50,335
[SPEAKER_25]: It's like a six to me.

1579
02:09:50,355 --> 02:09:51,155
[SPEAKER_25]: That's the original.

1580
02:09:51,475 --> 02:09:54,518
[SPEAKER_07]: How can something be missing from the original?

1581
02:09:56,739 --> 02:09:57,320
[SPEAKER_25]: The remix!

1582
02:09:57,540 --> 02:09:59,581
[SPEAKER_25]: That's what's missing from it, because it sucked.

1583
02:09:59,781 --> 02:10:00,742
[SPEAKER_25]: The remix made it better.

1584
02:10:01,142 --> 02:10:02,263
[SPEAKER_25]: So, it gets a six.

1585
02:10:02,563 --> 02:10:03,604
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know who you are anymore.

1586
02:10:04,945 --> 02:10:06,486
[SPEAKER_25]: I want Song 2 better.

1587
02:10:07,367 --> 02:10:07,687
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright.

1588
02:10:07,807 --> 02:10:10,009
[SPEAKER_25]: Blur's Song 2 is awesome.

1589
02:10:10,149 --> 02:10:16,373
[SPEAKER_25]: I would, you know, I give the song itself a ten, because I love that song, but I don't know, it's a cage match pick.

1590
02:10:16,494 --> 02:10:18,375
[SPEAKER_25]: I kind of like it when songs I haven't heard...

1591
02:10:18,769 --> 02:10:22,754
[SPEAKER_25]: But I know it was a mistake, so as a song, I give it a 10, but as a cage match pick, I give it an 8.

1592
02:10:22,834 --> 02:10:24,155
[SPEAKER_25]: It's alright.

1593
02:10:24,255 --> 02:10:24,556
[SPEAKER_25]: Angel.

1594
02:10:26,278 --> 02:10:27,279
[SPEAKER_06]: It's blur, it's good, 9.5.

1595
02:10:30,563 --> 02:10:33,144
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank God I didn't get done what I wanted to do.

1596
02:10:34,345 --> 02:10:41,428
[SPEAKER_25]: I have a remix that I thought about doing, that I'm looking at doing, that you're going to be like, when you hear it, you'll be like, what?

1597
02:10:42,088 --> 02:10:45,409
[SPEAKER_25]: Is it, oh, you know what, Jamie's not in the room right now, is it a Gorillaz mix or something?

1598
02:10:45,469 --> 02:10:47,490
[SPEAKER_25]: Is that, uh, something?

1599
02:10:47,550 --> 02:10:47,750
[SPEAKER_25]: No.

1600
02:10:47,770 --> 02:10:48,231
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, okay.

1601
02:10:48,331 --> 02:10:54,393
[SPEAKER_25]: Imagine, um, it's, just, just, it's in a John Travolta movie.

1602
02:10:54,713 --> 02:10:56,194
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh boy, alright, alright, we'll see.

1603
02:10:57,202 --> 02:10:59,484
[SPEAKER_25]: Is it like the Black Eyed Peas doing Misery Lou or something?

1604
02:10:59,865 --> 02:11:00,005
[SPEAKER_25]: No.

1605
02:11:00,205 --> 02:11:00,565
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay.

1606
02:11:01,226 --> 02:11:03,629
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright, let's recap the three songs you can vote for tonight.

1607
02:11:03,689 --> 02:11:06,171
[SPEAKER_25]: Song number one, The Ezoic, Let Me Tell You Something.

1608
02:11:12,898 --> 02:11:16,061
[SPEAKER_25]: Song number two you can vote for tonight is Monolithic with Wraith.

1609
02:11:23,769 --> 02:11:27,412
[SPEAKER_25]: And song number three you can vote for tonight is Blur with Girls and Boys.

1610
02:11:36,558 --> 02:11:37,439
[SPEAKER_25]: All right.

1611
02:11:37,619 --> 02:11:39,900
[SPEAKER_25]: There's your three songs you can vote for tonight.

1612
02:11:39,980 --> 02:11:42,262
[SPEAKER_25]: Place vote now.

1613
02:11:42,362 --> 02:11:46,145
[SPEAKER_25]: Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.

1614
02:11:46,245 --> 02:11:47,065
[SPEAKER_25]: Hurry, hurry.

1615
02:11:47,105 --> 02:11:49,227
[SPEAKER_25]: And we'll tally them up and let you know who the winner is.

1616
02:11:50,047 --> 02:11:50,588
[SPEAKER_25]: Loki.

1617
02:11:50,608 --> 02:11:50,688
[SPEAKER_25]: Loki.

1618
02:11:51,127 --> 02:11:54,748
[SPEAKER_25]: This is always a part of the show where I ask you, what's going on in the sim scene, if anything?

1619
02:11:57,529 --> 02:11:57,829
[SPEAKER_25]: Nothing.

1620
02:11:58,169 --> 02:11:59,250
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, there was only one thing.

1621
02:11:59,270 --> 02:12:02,551
[SPEAKER_25]: They were doing some new... Well, a couple things, actually, I should mention.

1622
02:12:03,211 --> 02:12:05,152
[SPEAKER_25]: But myself was doing another remix contest.

1623
02:12:06,852 --> 02:12:10,734
[SPEAKER_25]: And the thing now, it's no mash mixes unless they're very good.

1624
02:12:11,454 --> 02:12:14,775
[SPEAKER_25]: And that was their specific instructions there.

1625
02:12:14,795 --> 02:12:15,055
[SPEAKER_25]: I see.

1626
02:12:16,396 --> 02:12:19,877
[SPEAKER_25]: And then also... Hey, I have a great Max 300 mix I want to submit.

1627
02:12:26,154 --> 02:12:28,556
[SPEAKER_25]: Do you think I could win the Balani style contest with this?

1628
02:12:28,676 --> 02:12:32,299
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know, you know, something like that should be in a dancing game, like in the groove.

1629
02:12:35,081 --> 02:12:35,682
[SPEAKER_25]: Couldn't resist.

1630
02:12:35,742 --> 02:12:37,723
[SPEAKER_25]: That is so awful.

1631
02:12:38,384 --> 02:12:42,127
[SPEAKER_25]: It's like, come on, they didn't even try to make it sound different.

1632
02:12:42,247 --> 02:12:42,547
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, it's...

1633
02:12:44,634 --> 02:12:48,377
[SPEAKER_25]: And then what the hell was the middle part there that had nothing to do with the whole song?

1634
02:12:48,778 --> 02:12:52,962
[SPEAKER_25]: Because, you know, putting piano stuff in a techno song, that's the hip thing to do.

1635
02:12:53,002 --> 02:12:55,684
[SPEAKER_25]: Look, look, you bashed on the game enough tonight.

1636
02:12:55,704 --> 02:12:56,565
[SPEAKER_25]: You've met your quota.

1637
02:12:56,585 --> 02:12:57,345
[SPEAKER_25]: Go back to the sim.

1638
02:12:57,426 --> 02:12:59,628
[SPEAKER_25]: Fine, anyways, nothing going on in the sim scene, really.

1639
02:13:01,569 --> 02:13:03,851
[SPEAKER_25]: We're still waiting for the Foon Mix 2 stuff to come out.

1640
02:13:03,891 --> 02:13:04,792
[SPEAKER_25]: That's what I'm waiting for.

1641
02:13:04,952 --> 02:13:07,915
[SPEAKER_25]: Hopefully by the end of the summer, because we need another Foon Mix release.

1642
02:13:08,642 --> 02:13:11,543
[SPEAKER_25]: And really, that's all that's kind of going on.

1643
02:13:11,863 --> 02:13:21,166
[SPEAKER_25]: A side note that's kind of interesting, MidiHead, who we've just heard a track from, is going to be doing a podcast coming soon.

1644
02:13:21,746 --> 02:13:32,870
[SPEAKER_25]: I believe the date is the 27th of July, and it's going to feature all of his remix songs that he's done for Dance Dance Revolution, including the stuff that's going to be in Ultramix 3.

1645
02:13:34,151 --> 02:13:35,071
[SPEAKER_25]: So check that out.

1646
02:13:37,784 --> 02:13:40,086
[SPEAKER_25]: If you don't check it out there, we will be replaying it on the show.

1647
02:13:41,167 --> 02:13:42,187
[SPEAKER_25]: Will we now?

1648
02:13:42,267 --> 02:13:44,228
[SPEAKER_25]: I wonder not.

1649
02:13:44,409 --> 02:13:46,670
[SPEAKER_25]: The songs, I definitely want to play that.

1650
02:13:47,010 --> 02:13:53,655
[SPEAKER_25]: He's hoping that Konami gets behind this and starts promoting his podcast on iTunes and that type of thing.

1651
02:13:54,255 --> 02:13:58,758
[SPEAKER_25]: Get the whole company thing going.

1652
02:13:59,178 --> 02:14:01,179
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm still looking to remix some more songs.

1653
02:14:01,600 --> 02:14:06,683
[SPEAKER_25]: I've thought about a few things and the next one I want to do is really strange and I

1654
02:14:08,355 --> 02:14:09,956
[SPEAKER_25]: It's totally different.

1655
02:14:09,976 --> 02:14:12,338
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't even know if it's going to get off the ground.

1656
02:14:12,398 --> 02:14:14,640
[SPEAKER_25]: It's not a Bomani track at all.

1657
02:14:15,781 --> 02:14:17,222
[SPEAKER_25]: And I already told Rob what it was.

1658
02:14:18,223 --> 02:14:19,204
[SPEAKER_25]: I only half heard it, though.

1659
02:14:19,224 --> 02:14:23,848
[SPEAKER_25]: If it is what I thought you said, then I'm, yeah, very interesting.

1660
02:14:25,469 --> 02:14:25,850
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know.

1661
02:14:25,890 --> 02:14:33,056
[SPEAKER_25]: When I heard the song again, when I was sitting in Mel's, it just sounded to me, I was like, this could be a club track.

1662
02:14:33,536 --> 02:14:33,937
[SPEAKER_25]: It could be.

1663
02:14:33,957 --> 02:14:35,458
[SPEAKER_25]: Someone should have done a remix of this.

1664
02:14:36,460 --> 02:14:37,942
[SPEAKER_25]: But it's very strange.

1665
02:14:38,663 --> 02:14:42,888
[SPEAKER_25]: And I don't know if I can do it justice or even do a remix of it.

1666
02:14:42,949 --> 02:14:46,293
[SPEAKER_25]: So that's why I'm kind of keeping it under wraps for now.

1667
02:14:47,635 --> 02:14:47,915
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay.

1668
02:14:48,868 --> 02:14:52,051
[SPEAKER_25]: Hey, tell me about this DM Ashura thing you were talking to me about earlier.

1669
02:14:52,511 --> 02:14:56,033
[SPEAKER_25]: DM Ashura is doing songs now for O2 Jam.

1670
02:14:56,574 --> 02:14:57,554
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, they're still around.

1671
02:14:58,315 --> 02:15:02,337
[SPEAKER_25]: His new song for O2 Jam is going to be Go, and they have a little preview.

1672
02:15:02,738 --> 02:15:07,801
[SPEAKER_25]: There's a thread on their music production forum about it.

1673
02:15:08,806 --> 02:15:09,427
[SPEAKER_25]: So go check it out.

1674
02:15:09,447 --> 02:15:17,153
[SPEAKER_25]: It sounds sort of like techno with a bit of the Japanese tribal stuff in there.

1675
02:15:17,293 --> 02:15:20,015
[SPEAKER_25]: Sort of like Japan or exotic ethnic type stuff.

1676
02:15:20,336 --> 02:15:21,496
[SPEAKER_25]: But it's really good.

1677
02:15:22,437 --> 02:15:23,758
[SPEAKER_25]: So definitely check it out.

1678
02:15:23,798 --> 02:15:32,686
[SPEAKER_25]: The only problem is it's a recording of someone playing it, so it's not completely in sync, but it's good enough.

1679
02:15:33,586 --> 02:15:34,027
[SPEAKER_25]: Get an idea.

1680
02:15:35,988 --> 02:15:37,129
[SPEAKER_25]: But yeah, so that's kind of cool.

1681
02:15:37,670 --> 02:15:37,890
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay.

1682
02:15:38,939 --> 02:15:40,740
[SPEAKER_25]: How many Max remixes put out this week?

1683
02:15:41,260 --> 02:15:52,287
[SPEAKER_25]: You know, I haven't been downloading remixes on Bomani style, but, you know, since we've got, you know, a second here, let's... Actually, I found this sim file and it had a real sweet Max remix in it.

1684
02:15:52,327 --> 02:15:52,727
[SPEAKER_25]: Want to hear it?

1685
02:15:58,931 --> 02:15:59,772
[SPEAKER_25]: Couldn't resist, sorry.

1686
02:16:02,193 --> 02:16:03,854
[SPEAKER_25]: It's just so wrong.

1687
02:16:04,574 --> 02:16:05,375
[SPEAKER_25]: So, so wrong.

1688
02:16:05,796 --> 02:16:13,441
[SPEAKER_25]: But anyways, let's see, this week's Max Remix quota here.

1689
02:16:14,442 --> 02:16:21,467
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright, and your total is... Oh, it's like a telethon, waiting for the big results.

1690
02:16:22,669 --> 02:16:23,790
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, let's see.

1691
02:16:23,850 --> 02:16:36,094
[SPEAKER_25]: There wasn't too much this week, starting with we have The Legend of Max, 300 BPM, whatever that is, Paranoia Climax, Japan Mix.

1692
02:16:37,203 --> 02:16:41,946
[SPEAKER_25]: The Legend of Max Tribute and Max Attack, all of which are re-released.

1693
02:16:42,627 --> 02:16:46,489
[SPEAKER_25]: However, though, in June, there was quite a bit on the week beforehand.

1694
02:16:46,529 --> 02:16:58,156
[SPEAKER_25]: We had Maximizer, Max Naruku Jr., Max Beats, The Legend of Max Part 1, Paranoia, Max Dirty Mix, Legend of Max Mega Mix, Max 300 Mutation, and Rave Max.

1695
02:16:59,877 --> 02:17:01,378
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, and Love It First Max.

1696
02:17:03,877 --> 02:17:06,879
[SPEAKER_07]: How about my Max brings other boys to the yard?

1697
02:17:08,620 --> 02:17:09,060
[SPEAKER_25]: All right.

1698
02:17:09,421 --> 02:17:09,901
[SPEAKER_25]: You wait.

1699
02:17:10,201 --> 02:17:10,701
[SPEAKER_25]: You wait.

1700
02:17:10,882 --> 02:17:11,282
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm done.

1701
02:17:13,603 --> 02:17:13,923
[SPEAKER_25]: You know what?

1702
02:17:13,943 --> 02:17:16,405
[SPEAKER_25]: Somebody should mix Max 300 and Energizer together.

1703
02:17:16,425 --> 02:17:17,686
[SPEAKER_25]: That would be sweet.

1704
02:17:17,886 --> 02:17:18,406
[SPEAKER_25]: What do you mean?

1705
02:17:19,067 --> 02:17:19,847
[SPEAKER_25]: You wouldn't hear it.

1706
02:17:20,307 --> 02:17:20,668
[SPEAKER_25]: All right.

1707
02:17:21,308 --> 02:17:24,470
[SPEAKER_25]: Let's hear tonight's cage match winner.

1708
02:17:24,490 --> 02:17:25,371
[SPEAKER_25]: Are you kids ready for this?

1709
02:17:26,131 --> 02:17:26,411
[SPEAKER_25]: I guess.

1710
02:17:27,152 --> 02:17:30,714
[SPEAKER_25]: Tonight's cage match winner is a type.

1711
02:17:31,673 --> 02:17:33,435
[SPEAKER_25]: Girls and Boys, People Have Taste, and song number two that is a tie tonight is

1712
02:17:49,597 --> 02:17:53,140
[SPEAKER_15]: He is Zoic with Let Me Tell You Something.

1713
02:17:53,220 --> 02:17:54,581
[SPEAKER_25]: So let me tell you something.

1714
02:17:55,261 --> 02:17:58,663
[SPEAKER_25]: This means Loki's got to break the tie because his song didn't win.

1715
02:17:59,084 --> 02:18:00,064
[SPEAKER_25]: So what do you think, Loki?

1716
02:18:00,445 --> 02:18:00,785
[SPEAKER_25]: Holic.

1717
02:18:00,965 --> 02:18:02,346
[SPEAKER_25]: No.

1718
02:18:04,167 --> 02:18:05,969
[SPEAKER_25]: Which song do I dislike the most?

1719
02:18:07,670 --> 02:18:08,210
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know.

1720
02:18:08,270 --> 02:18:09,251
[SPEAKER_25]: Zoic is just kind of...

1721
02:18:10,579 --> 02:18:12,600
[SPEAKER_25]: No, I'm going to have to give it to Blur.

1722
02:18:12,820 --> 02:18:13,741
[SPEAKER_07]: Woohoo!

1723
02:18:14,202 --> 02:18:15,363
[SPEAKER_07]: You've redeemed yourself tonight.

1724
02:18:15,383 --> 02:18:15,583
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

1725
02:18:15,663 --> 02:18:16,243
[SPEAKER_25]: Whatever.

1726
02:18:16,604 --> 02:18:18,645
[SPEAKER_25]: You only did that to redeem yourself with Jamie.

1727
02:18:18,665 --> 02:18:26,732
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you realize this is technically the fourth song with Damon singing this one?

1728
02:18:30,695 --> 02:18:31,035
[SPEAKER_25]: Wow.

1729
02:18:33,157 --> 02:18:34,038
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright, there it is.

1730
02:18:35,168 --> 02:18:35,989
[SPEAKER_25]: And you know what's sad?

1731
02:18:36,449 --> 02:18:38,271
[SPEAKER_25]: I just got another vote.

1732
02:18:38,751 --> 02:18:40,253
[SPEAKER_25]: And it would have broken the tie the other way.

1733
02:18:40,553 --> 02:18:41,614
[SPEAKER_25]: But, too late.

1734
02:18:41,634 --> 02:18:44,356
[SPEAKER_25]: You gotta get your votes in on time.

1735
02:18:44,376 --> 02:18:53,745
[SPEAKER_25]: Then we have Max to the Max, Head to Toes 280 Max Survivor, and Max Insanity with Link.

1736
02:18:57,042 --> 02:18:58,002
[SPEAKER_25]: I think we're going to go to a break.

1737
02:18:58,042 --> 02:19:05,864
[SPEAKER_25]: When we come back from this break, of course, the FUs of the week because we are angsty individuals and we are going to spread that angst throughout the world.

1738
02:19:06,405 --> 02:19:08,945
[SPEAKER_25]: And also when we come back, some Ask Orange Lounge if we have a little time.

1739
02:19:08,965 --> 02:19:09,565
[SPEAKER_16]: And you know what?

1740
02:19:09,926 --> 02:19:14,767
[SPEAKER_25]: While you're waiting for us to come back, you can also download such sim files as Max Tampon.

1741
02:19:16,667 --> 02:19:17,588
[SPEAKER_25]: That's lovely.

1742
02:19:17,868 --> 02:19:18,768
[SPEAKER_25]: That's very lovely.

1743
02:19:21,129 --> 02:19:23,389
[SPEAKER_25]: I think we need some Eurobeat in the house.

1744
02:19:23,929 --> 02:19:25,850
[SPEAKER_25]: So we're going to do some Eurobeat.

1745
02:19:27,677 --> 02:19:28,739
[SPEAKER_25]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1746
02:20:24,292 --> 02:20:25,020
and the rest of us.

1747
02:21:29,131 --> 02:21:30,592
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you for watching!

1748
02:22:27,525 --> 02:22:28,432
Thanks for watching!

1749
02:23:49,987 --> 02:23:51,569
Thanks for watching!

1750
02:24:36,437 --> 02:24:37,577
Thank you for watching!

1751
02:26:49,480 --> 02:26:54,244
[SPEAKER_15]: From Step Squad to Orange Lab, this PDR sucks!

1752
02:26:54,664 --> 02:26:57,126
[SPEAKER_15]: Holla!

1753
02:26:58,787 --> 02:26:59,328
[SPEAKER_14]: P.S.

1754
02:27:00,048 --> 02:27:01,249
[SPEAKER_15]: T.T.P.O.

1755
02:27:03,831 --> 02:27:05,112
[SPEAKER_25]: Whatever happened to Step Squad?

1756
02:27:05,152 --> 02:27:06,193
[SPEAKER_25]: Are they still doing stuff?

1757
02:27:06,874 --> 02:27:07,174
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know.

1758
02:27:07,194 --> 02:27:10,236
[SPEAKER_25]: They're supposed to be going to dinner sometime this month.

1759
02:27:10,577 --> 02:27:11,237
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, that's nice.

1760
02:27:11,738 --> 02:27:12,178
[SPEAKER_25]: That's nice.

1761
02:27:12,838 --> 02:27:14,460
[SPEAKER_25]: Good bunch of kids, that Step Squad.

1762
02:27:14,540 --> 02:27:17,202
[SPEAKER_25]: With the exception of this one girl, DarkSakura.

1763
02:27:17,262 --> 02:27:17,982
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, fuck you!

1764
02:27:18,022 --> 02:27:18,643
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm just kidding.

1765
02:27:20,285 --> 02:27:22,008
[SPEAKER_25]: Velfia2000, Pandora, Natali from 2DX7Style, Initial D

1766
02:27:30,526 --> 02:27:31,446
[SPEAKER_25]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1767
02:28:00,222 --> 02:28:01,963
[SPEAKER_25]: I kind of wish Parapara would make a comeback.

1768
02:28:02,523 --> 02:28:03,043
[SPEAKER_25]: Like in the U.S.

1769
02:28:03,063 --> 02:28:03,883
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I know.

1770
02:28:04,744 --> 02:28:06,584
[SPEAKER_07]: They tried to open a Parapara club in L.A.

1771
02:28:07,065 --> 02:28:07,745
[SPEAKER_25]: Did they really?

1772
02:28:07,805 --> 02:28:08,865
[SPEAKER_25]: I think it flopped.

1773
02:28:09,105 --> 02:28:12,387
[SPEAKER_25]: Pioneers releasing the Parapara CDs here.

1774
02:28:13,167 --> 02:28:14,207
[SPEAKER_25]: They need to have a Parapara TV.

1775
02:28:14,227 --> 02:28:16,428
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been buying the anime Parapara CDs.

1776
02:28:16,488 --> 02:28:19,349
[SPEAKER_25]: They should have a Parapara TV show on AZN television.

1777
02:28:19,369 --> 02:28:19,969
[SPEAKER_25]: Have you seen this?

1778
02:28:20,570 --> 02:28:23,010
[SPEAKER_25]: I get AZN TV now.

1779
02:28:23,031 --> 02:28:25,271
[SPEAKER_25]: They rebranded International Channel as AZN.

1780
02:28:25,311 --> 02:28:26,392
[SPEAKER_25]: Now you have a reason to watch TV.

1781
02:28:26,412 --> 02:28:27,352
[SPEAKER_25]: The AZN Network.

1782
02:28:27,392 --> 02:28:27,752
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

1783
02:28:27,812 --> 02:28:29,653
[SPEAKER_07]: No, because I caught Fushigi Yugi Dubbed.

1784
02:28:30,410 --> 02:28:37,316
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, I wanted to pour bleach into my head, shake it around, pour it back out, and then follow it up with Witch Hazel or something.

1785
02:28:37,336 --> 02:28:39,537
[SPEAKER_25]: I saw some pretty funny sitcom on there the other day.

1786
02:28:39,557 --> 02:28:41,239
[SPEAKER_25]: It was some Filipino sitcom, I think it was.

1787
02:28:41,359 --> 02:28:42,300
[SPEAKER_25]: It was cute.

1788
02:28:42,560 --> 02:28:42,940
[SPEAKER_25]: I liked it.

1789
02:28:44,842 --> 02:28:45,162
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright.

1790
02:28:45,970 --> 02:28:47,971
[SPEAKER_25]: DarkSakura, why is it that we have to do these FUs every single week?

1791
02:29:19,062 --> 02:29:21,583
[SPEAKER_07]: Big F you goes to the fucking hurricane.

1792
02:29:22,444 --> 02:29:29,728
[SPEAKER_07]: Because, you know, I was all really, really worried about my family.

1793
02:29:30,288 --> 02:29:32,270
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was just a bunch of crap.

1794
02:29:32,310 --> 02:29:35,391
[SPEAKER_07]: I was getting all sick and, you know.

1795
02:29:36,172 --> 02:29:38,353
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the hurricane, like, hit Sarasota.

1796
02:29:39,494 --> 02:29:43,096
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was like, where I'm glad it didn't hit Mobile.

1797
02:29:44,296 --> 02:29:45,597
[SPEAKER_07]: It's sort of, I feel let down.

1798
02:29:46,378 --> 02:29:47,938
[SPEAKER_07]: In a really, you know, messed up way.

1799
02:29:48,579 --> 02:29:48,759
[SPEAKER_07]: But...

1800
02:29:49,372 --> 02:29:55,975
[SPEAKER_07]: At least, you know, I'm glad my family and all my friends out in the area are doing okay, and I'm sorry for poor, poor Sarasota.

1801
02:29:57,335 --> 02:30:05,199
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, another FU goes to, uh, my digestive system for, I guess, not working anymore.

1802
02:30:07,300 --> 02:30:15,363
[SPEAKER_07]: Because, um, I've been going through just, digestion hurts worse than being hungry right now.

1803
02:30:16,758 --> 02:30:20,139
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's a horrible state for someone to find oneself in.

1804
02:30:21,339 --> 02:30:23,880
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't think I'm going to eat for a week.

1805
02:30:25,140 --> 02:30:26,320
[SPEAKER_07]: And see if that helps.

1806
02:30:26,340 --> 02:30:30,581
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I was starting to feel better before I came here and actually felt a little hungry.

1807
02:30:30,661 --> 02:30:33,001
[SPEAKER_07]: So I ate a handful of Brazil nuts.

1808
02:30:34,122 --> 02:30:35,502
[SPEAKER_07]: And then drank a liter of water.

1809
02:30:35,522 --> 02:30:37,182
[SPEAKER_07]: And guess what?

1810
02:30:37,903 --> 02:30:38,403
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel sick.

1811
02:30:40,283 --> 02:30:40,743
[SPEAKER_07]: Fun, huh?

1812
02:30:42,944 --> 02:30:44,224
[SPEAKER_07]: And SU goes to...

1813
02:30:46,215 --> 02:30:46,755
[SPEAKER_07]: Buses.

1814
02:30:47,836 --> 02:30:48,416
[SPEAKER_07]: Not buses.

1815
02:30:49,256 --> 02:30:58,681
[SPEAKER_07]: Like 18-wheelers who drive on the left lane on a two-lane street, especially the winding mountain road going to Reno.

1816
02:30:59,401 --> 02:30:59,661
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1817
02:31:00,521 --> 02:31:04,083
[SPEAKER_07]: Y'all can, you know, drive off into a ravine or something.

1818
02:31:06,404 --> 02:31:10,006
[SPEAKER_07]: Another F you goes to 18-wheelers that try to pass other 18-wheelers.

1819
02:31:10,626 --> 02:31:13,427
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just sort of pointless because they can't really go out that fast anyway.

1820
02:31:15,088 --> 02:31:15,688
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's

1821
02:31:18,454 --> 02:31:19,214
[SPEAKER_25]: All right, Loki.

1822
02:31:21,476 --> 02:31:26,018
[SPEAKER_25]: Um, fuck you to my mouse for the left mouse button to stop working.

1823
02:31:26,459 --> 02:31:27,819
[SPEAKER_25]: It doesn't want to click no more.

1824
02:31:28,740 --> 02:31:32,602
[SPEAKER_25]: I've clicked it way too many times, and now it just, it spryically works.

1825
02:31:32,962 --> 02:31:36,064
[SPEAKER_25]: The other mouse buttons work fine, so I had to buy a new mouse yesterday.

1826
02:31:36,865 --> 02:31:40,787
[SPEAKER_25]: Which put me at Best Buy, and then I had to get in a stupid person line, and...

1827
02:31:41,286 --> 02:31:41,807
[SPEAKER_25]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1828
02:31:51,707 --> 02:31:53,548
[SPEAKER_25]: You know, I had to feed the paper through five times.

1829
02:31:53,568 --> 02:31:54,389
[SPEAKER_25]: It's just, like, nuts.

1830
02:31:54,969 --> 02:31:57,771
[SPEAKER_25]: Anyways, um... Fuck either of that.

1831
02:31:58,151 --> 02:32:00,673
[SPEAKER_25]: And fuck either the fact that there's no food in my house right now.

1832
02:32:00,693 --> 02:32:02,234
[SPEAKER_25]: At least nothing that I feel like eating.

1833
02:32:02,755 --> 02:32:04,316
[SPEAKER_25]: Because it's all leftovers.

1834
02:32:04,416 --> 02:32:05,557
[SPEAKER_25]: And I have, like, this big thing.

1835
02:32:05,597 --> 02:32:08,679
[SPEAKER_25]: I combined, uh... Some steak with the minestrone.

1836
02:32:08,719 --> 02:32:10,460
[SPEAKER_25]: And so it's this weird minest-steaky.

1837
02:32:11,100 --> 02:32:13,622
[SPEAKER_25]: And, um... Yeah, that's not very good.

1838
02:32:14,923 --> 02:32:18,045
[SPEAKER_25]: And then... My work, um... It's okay.

1839
02:32:18,686 --> 02:32:19,086
[SPEAKER_25]: But, um...

1840
02:32:20,168 --> 02:32:22,849
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know, I've just, like, been kind of feeling drained lately.

1841
02:32:22,889 --> 02:32:28,451
[SPEAKER_25]: I've been trying to stay up till, like, really late on the weekends, but I've been unable to do that for some reason.

1842
02:32:29,031 --> 02:32:31,052
[SPEAKER_25]: Just feeling really drained, and that sucks.

1843
02:32:31,192 --> 02:32:34,953
[SPEAKER_25]: And fuck you, stupid drivers, because they're always in my way.

1844
02:32:37,734 --> 02:32:42,595
[SPEAKER_25]: And, um... Uh... And the group sucks!

1845
02:32:44,876 --> 02:32:45,316
[SPEAKER_23]: Are you done?

1846
02:32:46,356 --> 02:32:48,117
[SPEAKER_25]: Um, and, um, you know those Macs?

1847
02:32:49,315 --> 02:32:51,316
[SPEAKER_25]: My toaster has better processing power than them.

1848
02:32:51,596 --> 02:32:51,936
[SPEAKER_25]: You're done.

1849
02:32:57,978 --> 02:33:06,021
[SPEAKER_25]: Um, I would like to give an FU to the assholes who broke into my car for the second time, and that's another $100 deductible that I won't be seeing anytime soon, so you can fight me.

1850
02:33:06,801 --> 02:33:15,944
[SPEAKER_25]: Um, I'd also like to give an FU to stress, because I was so stressed out on Friday, like, I got, I got this work thing, like, dropped on me literally at the last minute, and...

1851
02:33:16,630 --> 02:33:22,094
[SPEAKER_25]: On a normal day, that would have been okay, but I was dealing with other stresses that day as well, and I just wanted to die on Friday.

1852
02:33:22,355 --> 02:33:27,499
[SPEAKER_25]: Like, seriously, like, I was so stressed, this doesn't happen to me very often, but I was stressed where, like, I could taste vomit.

1853
02:33:27,859 --> 02:33:30,601
[SPEAKER_25]: Like, I'm gonna barf, I swear I'm gonna barf, although I didn't barf.

1854
02:33:31,302 --> 02:33:34,744
[SPEAKER_25]: But I really wanted to, and that sucks, to go around all day going, I'm gonna barf, no I'm not!

1855
02:33:35,305 --> 02:33:36,085
[SPEAKER_25]: That's how I felt Friday.

1856
02:33:36,586 --> 02:33:39,308
[SPEAKER_25]: So F you to barfing, because that's no fun, nobody likes that.

1857
02:33:39,688 --> 02:33:41,229
[SPEAKER_25]: Except Loki, when he's drunk.

1858
02:33:41,530 --> 02:33:41,890
[SPEAKER_25]: What, Loki?

1859
02:33:44,437 --> 02:33:45,818
[SPEAKER_25]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1860
02:34:13,897 --> 02:34:16,378
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright, that's it for my FUs, by the way.

1861
02:34:16,518 --> 02:34:18,679
[SPEAKER_25]: So let's go on to DDR Angel.

1862
02:34:19,639 --> 02:34:25,981
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, it's more of an honest FU as far as, uh, you know, the shit that happened in London.

1863
02:34:26,321 --> 02:34:26,961
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck that.

1864
02:34:27,362 --> 02:34:28,662
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't mess with people's lives.

1865
02:34:28,722 --> 02:34:32,323
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, I doubly, doubly add to that.

1866
02:34:32,603 --> 02:34:43,267
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, because I spent all day, even though, like, their, uh, what, our early morning is their lunchtime or whatever, even though I heard about it

1867
02:34:46,725 --> 02:34:57,632
[SPEAKER_06]: and all those people over there and I was just worried about it and I'm glad that he's okay and I'm glad that the rest of my friends in the UK are okay and they're alive.

1868
02:34:57,652 --> 02:34:59,033
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all I gotta say.

1869
02:34:59,173 --> 02:35:09,820
[SPEAKER_25]: I got a text message from my sister in the morning about it because she visited London an awful lot because her ex-husband was from there and while I personally don't know anybody except for some of our listeners that are over in that area, um,

1870
02:35:13,089 --> 02:35:13,810
[SPEAKER_25]: It's just a horrible thing.

1871
02:35:14,170 --> 02:35:14,690
[SPEAKER_25]: It's a horrible thing.

1872
02:35:16,032 --> 02:35:16,892
[SPEAKER_25]: What else can I say?

1873
02:35:17,092 --> 02:35:18,153
[SPEAKER_25]: What else can be said?

1874
02:35:18,614 --> 02:35:20,595
[SPEAKER_25]: It's a horrible thing that shouldn't exist in this world.

1875
02:35:20,735 --> 02:35:21,196
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

1876
02:35:21,536 --> 02:35:28,462
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, some people that I know are saying, like, you know, we should get used to it or whatever because that's what the world's coming to now.

1877
02:35:28,542 --> 02:35:29,142
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's just like, no.

1878
02:35:29,183 --> 02:35:30,444
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no.

1879
02:35:31,104 --> 02:35:35,268
[SPEAKER_06]: The whole point is for all of us to stick together and, you know, pretty much war...

1880
02:35:36,075 --> 02:35:39,198
[SPEAKER_06]: The mob's saying, hey, no matter how much you hurt us, we're still gonna stick together.

1881
02:35:39,438 --> 02:35:43,361
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, at the same time, I refuse to be terrorized by terrorists.

1882
02:35:43,761 --> 02:35:53,409
[SPEAKER_25]: So I will be continuing to do my function in this world, which is not only my day job, but to spread shit about people I don't like all over the internet.

1883
02:35:55,691 --> 02:35:56,252
[SPEAKER_06]: So you know what?

1884
02:35:57,252 --> 02:36:00,355
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck you guys, we're gonna catch you and... That's it.

1885
02:36:00,555 --> 02:36:00,955
[SPEAKER_06]: You're done.

1886
02:36:01,976 --> 02:36:03,858
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're gonna go on with our lives and...

1887
02:36:04,386 --> 02:36:06,847
[SPEAKER_06]: Do what we do on a day-to-day basis.

1888
02:36:08,909 --> 02:36:09,649
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's it, I'm done.

1889
02:36:10,189 --> 02:36:12,070
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright, let's get to chatroom FUs.

1890
02:36:16,873 --> 02:36:29,860
[SPEAKER_25]: Misty would like to give a general FU to the stupid people side of work and one to the schedule maker at work because I wish he'd just give me a somewhat set schedule so I could get a second job easier since I have no life outside of work and the internet right now anyway.

1891
02:36:33,257 --> 02:36:43,324
[SPEAKER_25]: DeepThought42 would like to say F you to the fascist douchebags that run our country and the parents who go crying to them every time little Timmy shoots up his physics class because he played Mortal Kombat when he was 12.

1892
02:36:46,206 --> 02:36:58,934
[SPEAKER_25]: Socorina says F you to EA for having some bastard registration system on their PS2 online system that has every name chosen except for stupid names like Pandora... Pandora Noria 2DX?

1893
02:36:59,234 --> 02:37:00,715
[SPEAKER_25]: Pandora Noia 2DX?

1894
02:37:01,836 --> 02:37:03,077
[SPEAKER_25]: Pandora Noia, I get it.

1895
02:37:04,056 --> 02:37:06,678
[SPEAKER_25]: I think that was a way to work in a cheap plug.

1896
02:37:06,698 --> 02:37:07,498
[SPEAKER_25]: What do you guys think?

1897
02:37:07,518 --> 02:37:08,479
[SPEAKER_25]: I think it was.

1898
02:37:23,971 --> 02:37:28,213
[SPEAKER_25]: Doob says, F you, a huge F you to 56k and AOL.

1899
02:37:28,534 --> 02:37:32,156
[SPEAKER_25]: I couldn't hear the show for about three weeks because of it, and I can barely hear it now.

1900
02:37:32,256 --> 02:37:33,517
[SPEAKER_25]: Everything is so slow.

1901
02:37:33,877 --> 02:37:35,658
[SPEAKER_25]: Right now I'm still listening to Heartbeat.

1902
02:37:35,878 --> 02:37:36,398
[SPEAKER_25]: Sad face.

1903
02:37:36,899 --> 02:37:37,059
[SPEAKER_25]: Aw.

1904
02:37:39,240 --> 02:37:42,382
[SPEAKER_25]: Dirty Thief says, F you to Taco Bell for making me fat.

1905
02:37:44,025 --> 02:37:44,445
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

1906
02:37:44,765 --> 02:37:45,946
[SPEAKER_07]: You have the choice to either or not.

1907
02:37:48,067 --> 02:37:50,528
[SPEAKER_25]: An MPQ says, F you to Las Vegas.

1908
02:37:50,889 --> 02:37:55,551
[SPEAKER_25]: Thanks for telling me that if you're not 21 and you can't spend hundreds of dollars an hour, you might as well be 5.

1909
02:37:56,431 --> 02:37:57,092
[SPEAKER_25]: Thanks, Vegas.

1910
02:37:57,132 --> 02:37:58,753
[SPEAKER_25]: Thanks for being 90 degrees at night.

1911
02:37:58,793 --> 02:38:00,874
[SPEAKER_25]: Thanks for making it a chore just to go outside.

1912
02:38:01,694 --> 02:38:03,035
[SPEAKER_25]: F you to driving in Oregon.

1913
02:38:03,375 --> 02:38:05,776
[SPEAKER_25]: Attention, Oregon, your speed limits are too low.

1914
02:38:06,256 --> 02:38:08,117
[SPEAKER_25]: Also, you can't pump your own gas there.

1915
02:38:08,438 --> 02:38:08,898
[SPEAKER_25]: I agree.

1916
02:38:09,258 --> 02:38:09,978
[SPEAKER_25]: What the fuck?

1917
02:38:10,259 --> 02:38:12,800
[SPEAKER_25]: Are people too stupid to put the hose in the tank there or something?

1918
02:38:13,420 --> 02:38:15,021
[SPEAKER_25]: F you to driving through the middle of nowhere.

1919
02:38:15,121 --> 02:38:19,244
[SPEAKER_25]: I hope I never see another next exit 10 miles or no services sign again.

1920
02:38:20,565 --> 02:38:20,905
[SPEAKER_25]: I agree.

1921
02:38:20,965 --> 02:38:21,585
[SPEAKER_25]: What's up with that?

1922
02:38:22,746 --> 02:38:23,847
[SPEAKER_25]: Learn how to pump your own gas.

1923
02:38:23,887 --> 02:38:24,387
[SPEAKER_25]: That's what we do.

1924
02:38:25,268 --> 02:38:26,328
[SPEAKER_25]: That was the last F you, anyway.

1925
02:38:27,309 --> 02:38:32,452
[SPEAKER_25]: It's the same thing in New Jersey, I think it is, where you can't pump your own gas.

1926
02:38:32,852 --> 02:38:34,673
[SPEAKER_25]: And somebody told me it's to create jobs.

1927
02:38:35,534 --> 02:38:35,654
Okay.

1928
02:38:38,396 --> 02:38:38,736
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay.

1929
02:38:41,044 --> 02:38:43,086
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright, moving right along.

1930
02:38:45,368 --> 02:38:55,698
[SPEAKER_25]: We're going to get into some Ask Orange Lounge in a little while, so please, if you have a question for us, send us a little message over on IRC or our chat room.

1931
02:38:55,758 --> 02:38:58,421
[SPEAKER_25]: Send me a private message if you have a question, something you want to ask us.

1932
02:38:59,181 --> 02:39:04,907
[SPEAKER_25]: I want to give a reminder to folks out there that right now Red Octane is putting together that game Guitar Hero.

1933
02:39:05,227 --> 02:39:06,048
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, they want...

1934
02:39:06,832 --> 02:39:16,697
[SPEAKER_25]: Your contributions, if you happen to be in a rock band, you could be alongside songs made famous by David Bowie, Red Hot Chili Peppers, White Zombies, Ramones, Hendrix.

1935
02:39:16,738 --> 02:39:17,918
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, we should form a band.

1936
02:39:18,559 --> 02:39:19,759
[SPEAKER_25]: Seriously, we should form a band.

1937
02:39:19,779 --> 02:39:20,740
[SPEAKER_07]: And be really awful.

1938
02:39:20,780 --> 02:39:21,800
[SPEAKER_07]: Send some music.

1939
02:39:22,221 --> 02:39:22,701
[SPEAKER_25]: Send some music.

1940
02:39:22,761 --> 02:39:25,642
[SPEAKER_07]: Since I can't play anything but saxophone and clarinet.

1941
02:39:25,722 --> 02:39:28,504
[SPEAKER_25]: You know what we could do is we could remix Max 300 and send it in.

1942
02:39:31,446 --> 02:39:32,206
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1943
02:39:32,226 --> 02:39:32,266
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1944
02:39:33,167 --> 02:39:33,947
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1945
02:39:35,168 --> 02:39:35,388
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1946
02:39:36,152 --> 02:39:36,472
[SPEAKER_07]: Triangle Player

1947
02:40:03,696 --> 02:40:04,856
[SPEAKER_25]: We'll give you some maracas.

1948
02:40:05,037 --> 02:40:06,037
[SPEAKER_25]: You can play the gong.

1949
02:40:06,117 --> 02:40:07,978
[SPEAKER_04]: There'll be the samba de amigo maracas.

1950
02:40:08,098 --> 02:40:15,763
[SPEAKER_25]: We'll just wheel out the giant gong, and then at the end, Loki just... That would be hideous.

1951
02:40:16,783 --> 02:40:24,808
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, Loki should be... You know what, Loki should... Loki's gonna have to learn how to play drums.

1952
02:40:25,248 --> 02:40:25,688
[SPEAKER_25]: That's what it is.

1953
02:40:25,709 --> 02:40:26,909
[SPEAKER_25]: Loki, you learn how to play drums.

1954
02:40:27,009 --> 02:40:29,711
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, all the greats have played drums, like Don Henley.

1955
02:40:30,231 --> 02:40:31,292
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll bribe, we'll bribe...

1956
02:40:33,325 --> 02:40:34,966
[SPEAKER_25]: We'll bribe Iguana Girl to be our singer.

1957
02:40:35,326 --> 02:40:37,828
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay.

1958
02:40:41,271 --> 02:40:41,871
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright.

1959
02:40:41,951 --> 02:40:43,312
[SPEAKER_25]: Our band would be awesome.

1960
02:40:43,372 --> 02:40:59,544
[SPEAKER_25]: Even though our band is destined to be in this game, if you want to try and compete against us, you piddly fools, or you have a friend who's in a band who is feeling like competing against us, fools, go to www.beaguitarhero.com and submit your entry.

1961
02:41:00,285 --> 02:41:02,226
[SPEAKER_25]: And you, too, can be a guitar hero.

1962
02:41:05,618 --> 02:41:05,938
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright.

1963
02:41:07,479 --> 02:41:16,605
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess, uh, since there's no questions for Ask Orange Loudhead... Ask us a question, or we will talk about the Lindsay Lohan.

1964
02:41:16,845 --> 02:41:18,026
[SPEAKER_25]: No, we'll go to a quick break.

1965
02:41:18,046 --> 02:41:19,547
[SPEAKER_25]: We're going to do a quick little two-song break.

1966
02:41:19,567 --> 02:41:21,728
[SPEAKER_05]: But I want to talk about Lindsay Lohan.

1967
02:41:21,888 --> 02:41:25,951
[SPEAKER_25]: I want to talk about, well, I have Beatmania on my PSP.

1968
02:41:26,651 --> 02:41:27,732
[SPEAKER_25]: Tell us about this, then.

1969
02:41:28,132 --> 02:41:33,516
[SPEAKER_25]: I have a Game Boy Color emulator called Rin on there, and I found a ROM for Beatmania 2.

1970
02:41:34,403 --> 02:41:36,664
[SPEAKER_25]: and so now I have Beatmania on my PSP.

1971
02:41:37,324 --> 02:41:39,785
[SPEAKER_25]: As well as DDR, but I took DDR off there because that was annoying.

1972
02:41:40,586 --> 02:41:45,068
[SPEAKER_25]: I found that DDR2 for the Game Boy Color had all the solo songs in it, though.

1973
02:41:45,788 --> 02:41:48,929
[SPEAKER_25]: In their 8, or whatever, yeah, 8-bit glory.

1974
02:41:49,409 --> 02:41:52,811
[SPEAKER_25]: But Hot Limit's in there.

1975
02:41:53,051 --> 02:41:54,172
[SPEAKER_25]: I gotta pull up Hot Limit.

1976
02:41:54,332 --> 02:41:54,852
[SPEAKER_25]: That'd be funny.

1977
02:41:55,052 --> 02:41:55,632
[SPEAKER_25]: We'll play that.

1978
02:41:56,272 --> 02:41:56,633
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright.

1979
02:41:58,213 --> 02:42:01,935
[SPEAKER_07]: This is probably going to make my heart hurt or something.

1980
02:42:03,436 --> 02:42:08,159
[SPEAKER_07]: If I wind up in the hospital because of hearing this song and I die there, I'm going to haunt you.

1981
02:42:09,440 --> 02:42:10,300
[SPEAKER_25]: Just thought I'd let you know.

1982
02:42:10,361 --> 02:42:13,222
[SPEAKER_25]: Do you think Lindsay Lohan looks better with red hair or her new blonde hair?

1983
02:42:13,983 --> 02:42:15,204
[SPEAKER_25]: I think the red hair looks better.

1984
02:42:15,224 --> 02:42:16,544
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't care.

1985
02:42:16,885 --> 02:42:18,326
[SPEAKER_25]: I think, though, she needs to eat something.

1986
02:42:18,726 --> 02:42:20,267
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, she needs to eat something.

1987
02:42:20,287 --> 02:42:23,749
[SPEAKER_25]: Did you hear about that website, EatLindsay, or FreeLindsay or something?

1988
02:42:23,769 --> 02:42:23,909
[SPEAKER_25]: What?

1989
02:42:24,049 --> 02:42:24,710
[SPEAKER_07]: What is it?

1990
02:42:25,250 --> 02:42:30,553
[SPEAKER_25]: EatSomethingLindsayOrSomething.com, or it's a petition going around trying to... It smells like fresh Lindsay in here.

1991
02:42:30,573 --> 02:42:30,934
Yeah.

1992
02:42:32,068 --> 02:42:33,229
[SPEAKER_25]: Is that your Lindsay?

1993
02:42:33,589 --> 02:42:33,890
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe.

1994
02:42:34,090 --> 02:42:35,811
[SPEAKER_25]: Are you talking about my Lindsay?

1995
02:42:37,292 --> 02:42:37,893
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe.

1996
02:42:38,413 --> 02:42:42,276
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright, we're starting to get some questions for Ask Orange Lounge, so I guess we should go into that segment.

1997
02:42:42,296 --> 02:42:42,576
[SPEAKER_25]: Should we?

1998
02:42:44,878 --> 02:42:45,058
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes?

1999
02:42:45,379 --> 02:42:47,000
[SPEAKER_25]: Do you got that song for us yet, Loki?

2000
02:42:47,280 --> 02:42:47,781
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm working on it.

2001
02:42:47,821 --> 02:42:48,922
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright, here we go.

2002
02:42:48,942 --> 02:42:50,223
[SPEAKER_25]: We'll go into Ask Orange Lounge first.

2003
02:42:58,890 --> 02:43:00,591
[SPEAKER_25]: This sounds like a Mega Man game or something.

2004
02:43:12,208 --> 02:43:13,069
[SPEAKER_15]: This is not Hot Limit.

2005
02:43:13,089 --> 02:43:16,192
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, here we go.

2006
02:43:16,873 --> 02:43:17,454
[SPEAKER_23]: Cheer, cheer.

2007
02:43:44,051 --> 02:43:44,432
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow.

2008
02:43:51,960 --> 02:43:52,560
[SPEAKER_25]: Interesting.

2009
02:43:55,103 --> 02:43:56,304
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright, let's get to the questions.

2010
02:43:56,444 --> 02:43:56,885
[SPEAKER_25]: Enough of that.

2011
02:44:01,249 --> 02:44:02,571
[SPEAKER_25]: FeedLindsay.com was the site.

2012
02:44:03,823 --> 02:44:06,745
[SPEAKER_25]: Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.

2013
02:44:07,246 --> 02:44:10,508
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?

2014
02:44:11,029 --> 02:44:14,331
[SPEAKER_25]: Is Lindsay better as a redhead, or is she a buxom blonde?

2015
02:44:14,932 --> 02:44:15,512
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know.

2016
02:44:15,792 --> 02:44:16,433
[SPEAKER_25]: You tell me.

2017
02:44:16,593 --> 02:44:18,454
[SPEAKER_25]: But secretly, I think she's not fat.

2018
02:44:18,715 --> 02:44:24,759
[SPEAKER_25]: I have boobies on my PSP.

2019
02:44:24,859 --> 02:44:26,661
[SPEAKER_25]: I hate having to improvise that song every week.

2020
02:44:28,302 --> 02:44:29,623
[SPEAKER_25]: First question from Socorina.

2021
02:44:29,943 --> 02:44:31,705
[SPEAKER_25]: Can you not talk about Lindsay Lohan?

2022
02:44:33,061 --> 02:44:35,442
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god, did you hear what she did last week?

2023
02:44:36,222 --> 02:44:37,743
[SPEAKER_07]: This is so awesome.

2024
02:44:40,544 --> 02:44:45,026
[SPEAKER_25]: But come on, I saw Herbie the... No, forget it, I'm not even going to try.

2025
02:44:45,906 --> 02:44:49,028
[SPEAKER_25]: MPQ wants to know, why does nobody ask questions?

2026
02:44:49,088 --> 02:44:53,830
[SPEAKER_25]: I think the reason nobody asks questions is because we do this almost every other week, and we really need a new bit.

2027
02:44:54,350 --> 02:44:56,851
[SPEAKER_25]: But we're just not feeling creative, honestly.

2028
02:44:57,239 --> 02:45:00,141
[SPEAKER_25]: Maybe for episode 150, which is next week, by the way.

2029
02:45:00,462 --> 02:45:02,183
[SPEAKER_25]: We'll have something new and fresh for you guys.

2030
02:45:02,203 --> 02:45:04,625
[SPEAKER_25]: But until then, it's the same old stale shit you know and love.

2031
02:45:04,905 --> 02:45:11,070
[SPEAKER_25]: The set fire to ferrets segment kind of got turned down.

2032
02:45:12,211 --> 02:45:14,953
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, DarkSakura didn't like that idea, and neither did my landlord.

2033
02:45:14,993 --> 02:45:15,373
[SPEAKER_25]: What can I say?

2034
02:45:15,393 --> 02:45:19,877
[SPEAKER_07]: The ferrets are awesome, and they're full of love and stuffing and beasing.

2035
02:45:21,511 --> 02:45:33,140
[SPEAKER_25]: I should point out, though, you should check out the album art on our podcast right now because it's Orange Lounge Radio and then it has little pictures, little little pictures of each of us and then the ferret in the bottom corner because there were four corners.

2036
02:45:33,160 --> 02:45:33,620
[SPEAKER_25]: That'd be four pictures.

2037
02:45:33,640 --> 02:45:34,981
[SPEAKER_25]: Whoa, there's pictures of us online?

2038
02:45:35,261 --> 02:45:36,342
[SPEAKER_25]: They're little little bitty pictures.

2039
02:45:36,362 --> 02:45:37,023
[SPEAKER_25]: Hold on, let me show you.

2040
02:45:37,483 --> 02:45:38,243
[SPEAKER_25]: I'll show you what it looks like.

2041
02:45:38,263 --> 02:45:39,064
[SPEAKER_25]: I have not seen this.

2042
02:45:39,104 --> 02:45:39,665
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes, you have.

2043
02:45:39,805 --> 02:45:40,525
[SPEAKER_25]: I showed this to you last week.

2044
02:45:40,565 --> 02:45:41,546
[SPEAKER_25]: It's on our website, right?

2045
02:45:42,066 --> 02:45:43,027
[SPEAKER_25]: I haven't seen this, actually.

2046
02:45:43,187 --> 02:45:43,908
[SPEAKER_25]: Hold on, hold on, hold on.

2047
02:45:44,308 --> 02:45:44,828
[SPEAKER_25]: Let me bring it up.

2048
02:45:46,109 --> 02:45:46,890
[SPEAKER_25]: Now you're making me work.

2049
02:45:48,021 --> 02:45:49,061
[SPEAKER_25]: You better work!

2050
02:45:49,122 --> 02:45:52,363
[SPEAKER_25]: No, I haven't seen this because I was trying to come up with something and I didn't.

2051
02:45:55,764 --> 02:45:56,225
[SPEAKER_25]: Orange Lime.

2052
02:45:56,345 --> 02:45:56,725
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, sorry.

2053
02:45:56,805 --> 02:45:57,725
[SPEAKER_25]: I had to bring it in the pocket.

2054
02:45:57,745 --> 02:45:58,105
[SPEAKER_25]: There it is.

2055
02:45:58,866 --> 02:45:59,106
[SPEAKER_25]: See?

2056
02:45:59,686 --> 02:46:00,166
[SPEAKER_25]: I like that.

2057
02:46:00,386 --> 02:46:00,667
[SPEAKER_25]: See?

2058
02:46:01,287 --> 02:46:04,268
[SPEAKER_25]: Me, DarkSakura, Loki, Ferret.

2059
02:46:04,868 --> 02:46:05,549
[SPEAKER_07]: What's that on?

2060
02:46:06,249 --> 02:46:08,410
[SPEAKER_25]: That's our album art for our podcast.

2061
02:46:08,550 --> 02:46:09,050
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, really?

2062
02:46:09,270 --> 02:46:09,570
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2063
02:46:09,630 --> 02:46:10,231
[SPEAKER_07]: That's great.

2064
02:46:11,711 --> 02:46:12,872
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the icon that I made.

2065
02:46:12,892 --> 02:46:15,613
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, that's the old-ass icon you made and then I did the border around it.

2066
02:46:15,633 --> 02:46:16,554
[SPEAKER_25]: So we kind of co-made it.

2067
02:46:16,714 --> 02:46:17,094
[SPEAKER_07]: That's fun.

2068
02:46:17,114 --> 02:46:17,534
[SPEAKER_07]: That's cool.

2069
02:46:18,075 --> 02:46:22,018
[SPEAKER_07]: And the ferret is our official fourth co-host.

2070
02:46:22,058 --> 02:46:22,358
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

2071
02:46:25,000 --> 02:46:26,460
[SPEAKER_05]: She says the same thing every time, though.

2072
02:46:26,480 --> 02:46:28,662
[SPEAKER_25]: No, we should totally get a sponsorship from Scoozy.

2073
02:46:29,462 --> 02:46:30,323
[SPEAKER_07]: We totally should.

2074
02:46:31,844 --> 02:46:33,745
[SPEAKER_25]: We pimp those ferrets like nothing else.

2075
02:46:34,165 --> 02:46:35,206
[SPEAKER_07]: God, we really do.

2076
02:46:35,967 --> 02:46:40,189
[SPEAKER_25]: Ron Chan wants to know, can I be the band manager and book y'all at the Apollo Theater?

2077
02:46:41,170 --> 02:46:42,111
[SPEAKER_25]: Fuck yeah, bring it on.

2078
02:46:42,531 --> 02:46:44,972
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, fuck no, we'd get booed off at the Apollo.

2079
02:46:46,874 --> 02:46:47,434
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

2080
02:46:48,575 --> 02:46:50,197
[SPEAKER_25]: Spelling Bee at the Apollo!

2081
02:46:50,217 --> 02:46:52,499
[SPEAKER_07]: Asphyxiation!

2082
02:46:53,159 --> 02:46:54,901
[SPEAKER_07]: A-S-F-I-X-O-N!

2083
02:46:56,482 --> 02:46:56,663
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

2084
02:46:57,323 --> 02:47:00,206
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I have heard somebody try to spell asphyxiation that way, but it was just sad.

2085
02:47:02,028 --> 02:47:04,570
[SPEAKER_25]: MPQ is making an interesting suggestion.

2086
02:47:04,630 --> 02:47:07,793
[SPEAKER_25]: He says, and this is actually live in the chat room at OrangeLunchRadio.com.

2087
02:47:07,813 --> 02:47:08,274
[SPEAKER_25]: Click on chat.

2088
02:47:08,314 --> 02:47:13,739
[SPEAKER_25]: He didn't send this over private message, but he says, Let's play the wolf game next week in the chat and radioize it.

2089
02:47:14,279 --> 02:47:14,719
[SPEAKER_25]: You know what?

2090
02:47:14,739 --> 02:47:21,183
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm not against the idea of doing some type of broadcasted The Wolf game, but I don't know how that would work with the chat.

2091
02:47:21,203 --> 02:47:22,264
[SPEAKER_25]: We'd have to have live people.

2092
02:47:22,704 --> 02:47:23,425
[SPEAKER_25]: Could be interesting, though.

2093
02:47:23,445 --> 02:47:24,225
[SPEAKER_25]: Could be very interesting.

2094
02:47:24,605 --> 02:47:29,208
[SPEAKER_25]: I'd have to think about the... What do you call that?

2095
02:47:29,268 --> 02:47:29,808
[SPEAKER_25]: Schematics?

2096
02:47:29,928 --> 02:47:30,869
[SPEAKER_25]: The way it would work.

2097
02:47:31,910 --> 02:47:32,570
[SPEAKER_25]: Let me think about it.

2098
02:47:32,610 --> 02:47:36,692
[SPEAKER_25]: MPQ, if you have an idea on how we could do that and actually have it be good radio, send me an email.

2099
02:47:36,873 --> 02:47:37,333
[SPEAKER_25]: We'll talk.

2100
02:47:38,353 --> 02:47:38,854
[SPEAKER_25]: Might be fun.

2101
02:47:39,254 --> 02:47:40,214
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm liking this.

2102
02:47:40,395 --> 02:47:41,015
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm liking this.

2103
02:47:42,456 --> 02:47:42,696
[SPEAKER_25]: All right.

2104
02:47:43,953 --> 02:47:45,314
[SPEAKER_25]: We have no more questions, you guys.

2105
02:47:46,614 --> 02:47:47,294
[SPEAKER_25]: You know what?

2106
02:47:47,434 --> 02:47:47,634
[SPEAKER_25]: What?

2107
02:47:49,455 --> 02:47:50,936
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to have questions.

2108
02:47:51,256 --> 02:47:52,296
[SPEAKER_25]: No, this is what we do.

2109
02:47:52,396 --> 02:47:54,737
[SPEAKER_25]: Usually when we get no questions is that we can ask each other questions.

2110
02:47:55,277 --> 02:47:57,458
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob, why are you so fabulous?

2111
02:47:58,658 --> 02:47:59,979
[SPEAKER_25]: Because I am a diva.

2112
02:48:01,440 --> 02:48:02,080
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, Rob.

2113
02:48:02,380 --> 02:48:02,540
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

2114
02:48:02,560 --> 02:48:04,061
[SPEAKER_07]: Why am I so famous?

2115
02:48:05,181 --> 02:48:05,981
[SPEAKER_25]: Because you're a diva.

2116
02:48:06,001 --> 02:48:07,062
[SPEAKER_25]: Because I'm a diva.

2117
02:48:08,362 --> 02:48:10,263
[SPEAKER_25]: Angel, you haven't been here in a month.

2118
02:48:10,823 --> 02:48:12,144
[SPEAKER_06]: Where the heck have you been?

2119
02:48:12,164 --> 02:48:13,144
[SPEAKER_25]: Where have you been, young lady?

2120
02:48:14,935 --> 02:48:17,196
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I don't know, gone?

2121
02:48:18,316 --> 02:48:19,596
[SPEAKER_07]: That doesn't answer the question!

2122
02:48:19,676 --> 02:48:21,137
[SPEAKER_07]: Gone is not a location!

2123
02:48:21,837 --> 02:48:23,217
[SPEAKER_07]: Gone is a state of being!

2124
02:48:25,338 --> 02:48:26,838
[SPEAKER_06]: Just haven't been able to show up, I guess.

2125
02:48:27,459 --> 02:48:28,059
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, yeah, anyway.

2126
02:48:28,119 --> 02:48:28,819
[SPEAKER_25]: She's been invisible.

2127
02:48:29,899 --> 02:48:30,479
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately.

2128
02:48:31,660 --> 02:48:33,200
[SPEAKER_25]: Domo-kun ate her boobs.

2129
02:48:33,480 --> 02:48:34,360
[SPEAKER_25]: That's what's going on.

2130
02:48:35,041 --> 02:48:35,301
Ah!

2131
02:48:36,261 --> 02:48:37,241
[SPEAKER_25]: I got wrist slapped for that one.

2132
02:48:38,382 --> 02:48:38,682
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright.

2133
02:48:40,662 --> 02:48:42,223
[SPEAKER_25]: See, now the chatroom's starting to like that idea.

2134
02:48:42,243 --> 02:48:43,523
[SPEAKER_25]: We'll have to figure that one out.

2135
02:48:44,358 --> 02:48:50,320
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright, we're going to go to a quickie break here, and then when we come back from this break, we're going to come back and wrap it all up.

2136
02:48:50,960 --> 02:48:53,521
[SPEAKER_25]: Tell you guys what you can look forward to next week on episode 150.

2137
02:48:54,301 --> 02:49:01,783
[SPEAKER_25]: So we'll be back after this, featuring, since you guys didn't send us questions, and I'm not pleased, you're being subjected to SmileDK this break.

2138
02:49:01,883 --> 02:49:02,203
[SPEAKER_25]: Enjoy.

2139
02:49:03,084 --> 02:49:04,004
[SPEAKER_25]: We'll be back after this.

2140
02:49:12,835 --> 02:49:28,821
[SPEAKER_15]: I thought a little bit of you today Look how I felt without myself for you Look a little bit at me today You know you gotta try a little harder So you can be my mama, my darling Smile, a little smile, let's enjoy the moment

2141
02:49:46,294 --> 02:49:55,316
[SPEAKER_15]: Try it, baby, good, just a little bit of lovin' Gonna feel so fine Is it really true that you feel the same way too?

2142
02:49:55,476 --> 02:50:15,720
[SPEAKER_15]: And hope we'll be together Now you know that I love you Love you, love you, love you, love you Love you, love you, love you, love you, love you When I'm feeling, thinking of A funny word we call love Still don't think of you at first

2143
02:50:16,989 --> 02:50:41,407
[SPEAKER_15]: My family still comes above If you wanna capture me It's as simple as can be Mr. Leonard said it, all you need is Mr. Leonard said it, all you need is Mr. Leonard said it, all you need is Love, my love, my love, my love, my love My love, my love, my love, my love, my love

2144
02:51:08,864 --> 02:51:09,528
DarkSakura

2145
02:51:35,896 --> 02:51:36,817
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for watching!

2146
02:52:35,999 --> 02:52:39,100
[SPEAKER_25]: We're back here on Orange Lounge Radio, coming here to wrap it all up.

2147
02:52:39,120 --> 02:52:43,441
[SPEAKER_25]: You know when I get bored, though, is I start looking through popular DDR forums to see what the kids are talking about.

2148
02:52:44,657 --> 02:52:55,003
[SPEAKER_25]: Why is it that on DDR forums there is always this kind of topic, at least on DDR Freak and some of the other big ones, there's always this kind of topic within the first three pages of a forum.

2149
02:52:55,383 --> 02:52:58,264
[SPEAKER_25]: Have you ever met your boyfriend or girlfriend through DDR?

2150
02:53:01,146 --> 02:53:03,707
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know, how about it guys, have you ever met your boyfriend or girlfriend through DDR?

2151
02:53:03,727 --> 02:53:11,552
[SPEAKER_07]: That's such a freaking old topic, it keeps popping up on every incarnation of DDR Freak, and honestly, as a moderator, I'm already seeing it!

2152
02:53:12,628 --> 02:53:15,671
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck you people, stop posting inane crap!

2153
02:53:16,652 --> 02:53:19,614
[SPEAKER_05]: Why can't we have intelligent conversation?

2154
02:53:19,974 --> 02:53:26,080
[SPEAKER_25]: Like... Well, some people did meet their boyfriend or girlfriend through DDR, which I think is... But this is an old thread.

2155
02:53:26,120 --> 02:53:28,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I did, but what business of it is yours?

2156
02:53:28,622 --> 02:53:33,366
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that is the first time I've ever heard Angel say something snide.

2157
02:53:33,406 --> 02:53:34,207
[SPEAKER_05]: It's great.

2158
02:53:34,247 --> 02:53:35,067
[SPEAKER_05]: You're learning!

2159
02:53:35,248 --> 02:53:36,729
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I were corrupting you!

2160
02:53:36,889 --> 02:53:38,030
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm with Andrew!

2161
02:53:38,230 --> 02:53:39,211
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, did I say that out loud?

2162
02:53:43,144 --> 02:53:44,104
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, that was beautiful.

2163
02:53:45,585 --> 02:53:46,825
[SPEAKER_25]: Save that one for the archives.

2164
02:53:46,905 --> 02:53:48,206
[SPEAKER_25]: Angel Gets Mean, episode 149.

2165
02:53:48,266 --> 02:53:51,747
[SPEAKER_06]: Finally, after how many episodes?

2166
02:53:54,567 --> 02:53:56,028
[SPEAKER_25]: Maybe it's sitting next to Loki lately.

2167
02:53:56,048 --> 02:53:57,788
[SPEAKER_25]: He's starting to rub off on you or something.

2168
02:53:59,649 --> 02:54:05,871
[SPEAKER_06]: Either that or it's, I don't know, all of our randomness rubbing off on me.

2169
02:54:08,431 --> 02:54:10,372
[SPEAKER_25]: Maybe people post this topic because they...

2170
02:54:12,636 --> 02:54:15,478
[SPEAKER_25]: They're sad because they want to meet a girl through DDR.

2171
02:54:16,279 --> 02:54:19,441
[SPEAKER_25]: They're sad and lonely and they want to meet a girl with similar interests as them.

2172
02:54:20,541 --> 02:54:21,122
[SPEAKER_25]: Here's the hint.

2173
02:54:21,922 --> 02:54:24,024
[SPEAKER_25]: I want to meet a girl with similar interests as you.

2174
02:54:25,024 --> 02:54:29,887
[SPEAKER_25]: Go outside and participate in those interests that you have.

2175
02:54:30,228 --> 02:54:34,991
[SPEAKER_25]: Because if you want to find a girl that plays DDR, you know where you're likely to find that girl that plays DDR.

2176
02:54:35,711 --> 02:54:36,111
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know.

2177
02:54:36,572 --> 02:54:38,053
[SPEAKER_25]: Out playing DDR somewhere.

2178
02:54:39,334 --> 02:54:40,014
[SPEAKER_25]: Food for thought.

2179
02:54:40,990 --> 02:54:48,376
[SPEAKER_25]: So my advice, if you're lonely and sad and single and you want to meet somebody, and you know what, I'm a lonely, sad, single guy, but I try.

2180
02:54:48,836 --> 02:54:54,801
[SPEAKER_25]: I go out and do things I enjoy because that is where I'm likely to meet people who have similar interests that I have.

2181
02:54:55,522 --> 02:54:56,883
[SPEAKER_25]: So I suggest you all do the same.

2182
02:54:59,865 --> 02:55:02,908
[SPEAKER_25]: Of course, now we've got all these comments here in the chat room there.

2183
02:55:05,526 --> 02:55:07,808
[SPEAKER_25]: What are you talking about upskirt cam for, DarkSakura?

2184
02:55:08,508 --> 02:55:11,650
[SPEAKER_07]: I was doing that just to make fun of the DDR stuff.

2185
02:55:13,492 --> 02:55:15,393
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's when I got subjected to that in 2003.

2186
02:55:15,733 --> 02:55:18,875
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I'm not funny.

2187
02:55:18,936 --> 02:55:19,136
[SPEAKER_06]: See?

2188
02:55:19,576 --> 02:55:20,937
[SPEAKER_25]: What is this?

2189
02:55:21,597 --> 02:55:23,339
[SPEAKER_25]: You were in an upskirt cam video?

2190
02:55:24,159 --> 02:55:26,101
[SPEAKER_25]: Angel was not in an upskirt cam video!

2191
02:55:26,721 --> 02:55:29,903
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I got subjected to the term upskirt cam in 2003.

2192
02:55:32,555 --> 02:55:33,375
[SPEAKER_25]: I get it, I get it.

2193
02:55:35,036 --> 02:55:35,856
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright, kids.

2194
02:55:36,696 --> 02:55:38,936
[SPEAKER_25]: It's time we end this train wreck of a show.

2195
02:55:39,977 --> 02:55:41,137
[SPEAKER_25]: Put the nails in the coffin.

2196
02:55:41,777 --> 02:55:43,317
[SPEAKER_25]: Go around and get everybody's final thought.

2197
02:55:43,397 --> 02:55:45,298
[SPEAKER_25]: Next week, boys and girls, it's episode 150.

2198
02:55:47,758 --> 02:55:49,259
[SPEAKER_25]: Holy crap, are we getting old.

2199
02:55:50,439 --> 02:55:51,139
[SPEAKER_06]: I still remember 69.

2200
02:55:51,259 --> 02:55:55,800
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember 69.

2201
02:55:55,940 --> 02:55:56,960
[SPEAKER_25]: Wait, your mic's off, I think.

2202
02:55:57,000 --> 02:55:57,741
[SPEAKER_25]: No, it's on.

2203
02:55:58,861 --> 02:55:58,941
[SPEAKER_25]: No.

2204
02:56:00,324 --> 02:56:01,284
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, it died for me.

2205
02:56:01,304 --> 02:56:02,565
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the mic is going out.

2206
02:56:02,605 --> 02:56:03,165
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

2207
02:56:03,225 --> 02:56:07,788
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't remember episode 69 because I was in San Diego living under the stairs in the Harry Potter room.

2208
02:56:08,309 --> 02:56:08,689
[SPEAKER_25]: I remember that.

2209
02:56:08,829 --> 02:56:09,910
[SPEAKER_25]: And the gay frat.

2210
02:56:09,930 --> 02:56:11,330
[SPEAKER_07]: That was great.

2211
02:56:11,871 --> 02:56:12,171
[SPEAKER_25]: All right.

2212
02:56:12,791 --> 02:56:13,212
[SPEAKER_25]: So I don't know.

2213
02:56:13,232 --> 02:56:13,812
[SPEAKER_25]: What are we going to do?

2214
02:56:13,832 --> 02:56:16,674
[SPEAKER_07]: I was surrounded by all these cute guys and they were all gay.

2215
02:56:17,354 --> 02:56:18,655
[SPEAKER_25]: What are we going to do for episode 150?

2216
02:56:18,795 --> 02:56:20,456
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, that's a pretty big number.

2217
02:56:21,437 --> 02:56:22,057
[SPEAKER_25]: I say it's time.

2218
02:56:22,097 --> 02:56:22,898
[SPEAKER_25]: Junk show!

2219
02:56:22,978 --> 02:56:23,158
[SPEAKER_25]: No.

2220
02:56:24,478 --> 02:56:26,220
[SPEAKER_25]: No, no more of those for a long time.

2221
02:56:26,300 --> 02:56:26,860
[SPEAKER_25]: No, no, no, no, no.

2222
02:56:26,880 --> 02:56:28,081
[SPEAKER_25]: I say we set the ferret on fire.

2223
02:56:28,241 --> 02:56:28,381
[SPEAKER_25]: No!

2224
02:56:35,073 --> 02:56:38,254
[SPEAKER_25]: We could rent a wood chipper and throw the ferret through a wood chipper.

2225
02:56:42,236 --> 02:56:44,497
[SPEAKER_25]: We'll try performing surgery on that a little later.

2226
02:56:45,177 --> 02:56:46,097
[SPEAKER_25]: Here, here, let me try something.

2227
02:56:46,117 --> 02:56:46,838
[SPEAKER_25]: Here, let's switch for a minute.

2228
02:56:48,298 --> 02:56:50,979
[SPEAKER_07]: What the fuck did the ferret ever do to you?

2229
02:56:51,459 --> 02:56:51,759
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay?

2230
02:56:53,220 --> 02:56:54,761
[SPEAKER_07]: The ferret has been good to you.

2231
02:56:55,741 --> 02:56:56,941
[SPEAKER_07]: The ferret has been nice.

2232
02:56:57,422 --> 02:56:57,862
[SPEAKER_07]: Check, check.

2233
02:56:57,882 --> 02:56:58,222
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we go.

2234
02:57:02,153 --> 02:57:06,581
[SPEAKER_07]: The ferret has been very good to you, yet you treat it so horribly.

2235
02:57:08,525 --> 02:57:11,691
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have some sort of deep-rooted fear of ferrets?

2236
02:57:12,913 --> 02:57:14,115
[SPEAKER_07]: Ferret bias?

2237
02:57:15,676 --> 02:57:18,598
[SPEAKER_25]: We're going to land ourselves an extra special guest for episode 150.

2238
02:57:18,638 --> 02:57:19,379
[SPEAKER_25]: We're going to work on that.

2239
02:57:19,399 --> 02:57:20,399
[SPEAKER_25]: You know what I would love to get?

2240
02:57:20,499 --> 02:57:22,440
[SPEAKER_25]: I should send an email this week, see if I can make it happen.

2241
02:57:22,761 --> 02:57:24,201
[SPEAKER_25]: Because I have connections.

2242
02:57:24,662 --> 02:57:28,464
[SPEAKER_25]: We should get some of the folks that made in the groove on the show to argue with Loki.

2243
02:57:28,484 --> 02:57:29,425
[SPEAKER_25]: I think it would be beautiful.

2244
02:57:29,605 --> 02:57:30,685
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my God, Rob.

2245
02:57:30,845 --> 02:57:32,927
[SPEAKER_07]: You just got a song stuck in my head.

2246
02:57:33,007 --> 02:57:33,307
[SPEAKER_25]: Do it!

2247
02:57:33,727 --> 02:57:34,047
[SPEAKER_25]: Do it!

2248
02:57:34,107 --> 02:57:34,388
[SPEAKER_07]: Do it!

2249
02:57:34,448 --> 02:57:37,129
[SPEAKER_07]: That connected song that gets yourself connected.

2250
02:57:38,590 --> 02:57:40,091
[SPEAKER_07]: Who was it that did that fucking song?

2251
02:57:40,131 --> 02:57:42,093
[SPEAKER_07]: This shit is bananas.

2252
02:57:42,173 --> 02:57:44,474
[SPEAKER_25]: B-A-N- No, forget it.

2253
02:57:44,594 --> 02:57:45,135
[SPEAKER_25]: On the wall.

2254
02:57:45,215 --> 02:57:45,855
[SPEAKER_25]: All right, all right.

2255
02:57:46,296 --> 02:57:47,757
[SPEAKER_25]: The chat room is suggesting we have an orgy.

2256
02:57:47,777 --> 02:57:49,098
[SPEAKER_25]: I think that was fluke.

2257
02:57:49,838 --> 02:57:51,640
[SPEAKER_25]: Episode 150 is girls only.

2258
02:57:51,680 --> 02:57:52,500
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, screw you.

2259
02:57:52,820 --> 02:57:53,201
[SPEAKER_25]: Screw you.

2260
02:57:53,361 --> 02:57:53,661
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

2261
02:57:54,141 --> 02:57:54,442
[SPEAKER_25]: All right.

2262
02:57:55,062 --> 02:57:55,782
[SPEAKER_25]: Let's go around again.

2263
02:57:55,802 --> 02:57:56,383
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, girls only.

2264
02:57:56,503 --> 02:57:58,825
[SPEAKER_25]: All breaks will be girls.

2265
02:58:02,047 --> 02:58:02,527
[SPEAKER_25]: Girls.

2266
02:58:02,627 --> 02:58:03,628
[SPEAKER_25]: It took me a minute to get that joke.

2267
02:58:03,848 --> 02:58:04,849
[SPEAKER_25]: All right, Angel, your final thought.

2268
02:58:06,604 --> 02:58:08,846
[SPEAKER_06]: Meteos was interesting, but I'm still playing it.

2269
02:58:10,047 --> 02:58:10,367
[SPEAKER_25]: Loki.

2270
02:58:10,647 --> 02:58:16,372
[SPEAKER_25]: Beatmania is hard to play on a PSP, or a Game Boy Advance for that matter, or a Game Boy Color.

2271
02:58:17,693 --> 02:58:20,875
[SPEAKER_25]: My final thought is, word around the office is you got a fat cock.

2272
02:58:21,475 --> 02:58:22,196
[SPEAKER_25]: DarkSakura.

2273
02:58:24,778 --> 02:58:26,579
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know how I can top that one.

2274
02:58:26,599 --> 02:58:27,320
[SPEAKER_07]: I do.

2275
02:58:32,985 --> 02:58:35,447
[SPEAKER_25]: You should have seen how her eyes looked all of a sudden.

2276
02:58:36,648 --> 02:58:37,949
[SPEAKER_25]: That was sexual harassment.

2277
02:58:39,691 --> 02:58:41,572
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to report you to HR.

2278
02:58:41,913 --> 02:58:43,274
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh wait, I am HR.

2279
02:58:43,314 --> 02:58:44,134
[SPEAKER_07]: Guess what we do?

2280
02:58:44,214 --> 02:58:44,855
[SPEAKER_07]: We flog.

2281
02:58:47,057 --> 02:58:50,219
[SPEAKER_07]: Nah, we're all up for those medieval forms of... They flog the dolphins.

2282
02:58:52,581 --> 02:58:55,183
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, I was going to go flog the... No, forget it.

2283
02:58:57,886 --> 02:59:00,448
[SPEAKER_07]: No, we use whips and chains and...

2284
02:59:01,556 --> 02:59:06,777
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I was telling somebody about an anime called Star Trap, Offenders of the Universe.

2285
02:59:07,458 --> 02:59:09,038
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to go ahead and quote a line from that.

2286
02:59:10,318 --> 02:59:11,839
[SPEAKER_07]: Eat me, beat me, make me write bad checks.

2287
02:59:14,860 --> 02:59:16,280
[SPEAKER_25]: And the final word of the show.

2288
02:59:16,460 --> 02:59:18,561
[SPEAKER_25]: One word to sum the whole damn thing up.

2289
02:59:19,081 --> 02:59:20,281
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm going to give it to DDR Angel.

2290
02:59:20,361 --> 02:59:21,081
[SPEAKER_25]: Come on, Angel.

2291
02:59:21,101 --> 02:59:22,122
[SPEAKER_25]: You haven't been here for a month.

2292
02:59:22,582 --> 02:59:23,042
[SPEAKER_25]: One word.

2293
02:59:23,142 --> 02:59:23,902
[SPEAKER_25]: Sum it all up.

2294
02:59:26,543 --> 02:59:26,923
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

2295
02:59:27,123 --> 02:59:27,363
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye.

2296
02:59:29,224 --> 02:59:34,105
[SPEAKER_21]: That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.

2297
02:59:34,926 --> 02:59:39,147
[SPEAKER_21]: Orange Lounge Radio Live is an Orange Lounge Radio production.

2298
02:59:39,627 --> 02:59:51,890
[SPEAKER_21]: For more information about our station, visit our website at www.orangeloungeradio.com And now, here is your fortune cookie message of the day.

2299
03:00:05,569 --> 03:00:28,653
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a real bad haircut and nowhere to go, except the Latin castle and Eckerdrum She had sweatpants, she liked to break dance, she wore a pair of shiny parachute pants I was a geek and she was a superstar Was a judge, was a judge, was a judge, yeah, was a judge, was a judge, like a wife While we're in the street for three nights, a judge

2300
03:00:30,590 --> 03:00:54,764
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried to meet her set of standards I had a pretty good collection of masters of the universe I had Boba Fett and Greedo when I was close to 17 She had dates of Dr. Connick and E. Logg and she knew how to back the game She had eyes that looked around for the boys who I had lately grown to hate At the time I was working on a novel Just another proof of my distraction I sometimes wondered what she would think of that

2301
03:01:03,746 --> 03:01:07,828
[SPEAKER_02]: Overwine and Crackers by a Lakeside, Wachita just moved back up and Moonwalked home.

2302
03:01:07,868 --> 03:01:13,351
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a jerk who put you out, while we're in the street between us.

2303
03:01:13,391 --> 03:01:17,954
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I should have made a sacrifice, or tried to meet her down at Sanders.

2304
03:01:17,974 --> 03:01:21,936
[SPEAKER_02]: But she didn't have respect for the drink as I didn't have respect for that.

2305
03:01:21,976 --> 03:01:25,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Ruben's shoes were not my style and they're still not, I was into D&D.

2306
03:01:25,978 --> 03:01:29,760
[SPEAKER_02]: Na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na.

2307
03:02:03,289 --> 03:02:09,335
[SPEAKER_02]: When I look back upon the 80s, I never get pissed off at Ronald Reagan, I never paid attention to him back then

2308
03:02:11,328 --> 03:02:36,644
[SPEAKER_02]: But that chick who wore the parachute pants, the one who broke my heart, the one who broke dance I just hope that one day we'll meet again I'm not sure, I'm not sure, I'm not sure, no, I'm not sure, I'm not sure what I would do I'm not sure it even matters Because I know wherever she is that she's got something stuck up in her ass And the clues to the doors that might just get taken only, taken only, taken only

2309
03:02:46,303 --> 03:02:48,724
Thank you very much for listening and we'll see you next week.

2310
03:03:38,171 --> 03:03:40,033
[SPEAKER_23]: Closing time.

2311
03:03:40,593 --> 03:03:45,057
[SPEAKER_23]: You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here.

2312
03:03:46,238 --> 03:03:46,579
[SPEAKER_23]: That's it.

2313
03:03:47,199 --> 03:03:47,620
[SPEAKER_23]: Show's over.

2314
03:03:47,740 --> 03:03:48,561
[SPEAKER_23]: So piss off!

2315
03:03:49,922 --> 03:03:50,622
[SPEAKER_25]: But come back next week.

2316
03:03:50,662 --> 03:03:56,428
[SPEAKER_25]: No, yeah, or come back in 15 seconds, because we're going to reconnect to the Bomani Music and More program with all your favorite DDR, 2DX, and so many favorites!

2317
03:03:56,708 --> 03:03:58,229
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and listen to my show Tuesday.

2318
03:03:58,490 --> 03:03:59,170
[SPEAKER_07]: Pump up the volume.

[SPEAKER_25]: And listen to the podcast, because we're cool.

2320
03:04:01,532 --> 03:04:02,033
[SPEAKER_25]: Good night, everybody!
