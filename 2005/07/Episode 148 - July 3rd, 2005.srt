34
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:31,900
In this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm is Dark Sakura. Jamie Summers?

35
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:45,900
You have to remember my roommate, the extra fur? Huge Buffy fan. Have you ever walked into his room and looked through the DVD collections?

36
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:46,900
I've seen them from across the hall.

37
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:51,900
It's just a whole shelf of Buffy and Angel.

38
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,900
I am of the happy for the show, but of the angst for other reasons.

39
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:56,900
What a waste of money.

40
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,900
Damn you, Hot Topic. Damn you!

41
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:03,540
We'll be getting into that a little while. We all have a lot of angst to say. I don't know about Loki.

42
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:06,820
I know I've got big angst to say. But I have a refrigerator now!

43
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:10,700
That's good. Refrigerators are good. Cold things are good. And the washer and dryer. I have some

44
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:14,540
surprises in the refrigerator right now. I've never been so excited to be able to do my

45
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:16,580
own laundry in a long time.

46
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:18,820
Would it be the fish tasty nice?

47
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:23,580
No, it's not the fish tasty nice. Shut your mouth.

48
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:27,080
You just... I don't know. Forget it. Anyway, in the other corner,

49
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:31,240

00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,900
I need to mix, I need to mix my own drink.

59
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:59,120
I got forty dollars worth of liquor tonight, so I'm gonna go get it, so somebody's gotta

60
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,300
fill time during this intro.

61
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,620
Tell the kids what they have to look forward to.

62
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:02,620
I had ice cream?

63
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,340
Cause I'm cheating like hell today.

64
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:09,020
I am having so much liquor that I'm probably gonna end up in the hospital with blood poisoning,

65
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:12,140
as in, you know, too much blood on my alcohol level.

66
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:16,660
See, Rod had something rotten in his freezer, so all of his ice tastes really fucking nasty,

67
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:20,060
so all my drinks are, like, not cold.

68
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,060
And that...

69
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,060
And so fish.

70
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,060
Exactly.

71
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:25,060
I was like, I smelled, I sniffed in their eye.

72
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,060
Ugh, what is that?

73
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,060
Like, I don't know, man.

74
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:33,060
I mean, even when our nasty freezer didn't smell that bad, but...

75
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:38,060
I can't really get too shitfaced tonight because I'm gonna go drinkin' at the club too.

76
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:40,060
Ahh!

77
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:44,060
You also got me pineapple and Malibu, but I have Guinness.

78
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:46,060
And no bottle opener!

79
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:48,060
I got Guinness, I'll get something.

80
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:55,800
Guinness, Peppermint Schnapps, Malibu Pineapple Rum, and there's also a Smirnoff Mandarin Orange.

81
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,260
Do you have any normal Malibu?

82
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,060
I don't think there's any left.

83
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,640
I hate to say it.

84
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,640
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

85
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,640
It is on sale!

86
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,640
sale!

87
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,640
Oh.

88
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,800
Is that the same bottle of Bacardi that's been sitting there for like weeks now?

89
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,180
Probably I don't know.

90
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,180
Guinness!

91
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,520
Go fetch!

92
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,500
Ew, Buzzy!

93
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:22,500
Licker, liquor, liquor, I wanna drink my goodness. Screw the show, gimme three!

94
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:27,500
We will be back after this break, cause I gotta go, what is wrong with that mic?

95
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,500
Ah!

96
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,500
It's not drunk yet. Needs more alcohol.

97
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,500
I want to be dunked.

98
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:37,500
Okay, we will work on that. And of course our alcohol show disclaimer when we come back after this.

99
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,500
We're not responsible for anything we say or do.

100
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,500
Or stuff.

101
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,500
Or who we kill.

102
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:47,500
In this break, some music that was popular when Orange Lounge Radio first started.

103
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,500
You remember what game was really big when Orange Lounge Radio first started?

104
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,500
DDR!

105
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:55,500
Max 2? DDR Max 2. DDR was actually still popular.

106
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,500
DDR Max 2. He made it funny.

107
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,500
I know.

108
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,500
How far listeners aren't going to get it? They're like, DDR's still cool.

109
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:07,500
DDR Max 2. And remember we were trying to unlock music and all that stuff?

110
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,500
Oh, good times. Good times.

111
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:13,500
Wasn't that also deep in the middle of playing Lots of Space Channel 5?

112
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,500
At that point you probably were.

113
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,500
Up, down, up, down, two, two, two.

114
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:22,500
In this break we're going to play some music from Max 2.

115
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,500
We'll start it off with Busta.

116
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,500
I will go find something to open that with.

117
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,500
Isn't it twisty off?

118
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,500
We'll be back.

119
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,500
Not twisty off.

120
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,500
We'll be back after this.

121
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,500
With more whining courtesy of Dark Sakura.

122
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,500
Oh

123
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:15,500
My love, I want you to be my man

124
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,500
Step, have a living cool master scream

125
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,500
If you wanna go faster, taking a train to the next station

126
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,500
On the dance floor, rocking the nation

127
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,500
The sound, it's coming out now

128
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,500
The day change, play your song loud

129
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,500
Dancing, make your body rock

130
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,500
Long train running and it won't stop

131
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,500
Like a bista, I keep on churning

132
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,500
Like a fire, I keep on burning

133
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,500
Hands around in a place

134
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,500
With every change they write a page

135
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,000
This is the beginning

136
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,500
That we're going round and round

137
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,500
And the silver is going to go in the heart

138
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,500
Of the battle that comes next

139
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,000
We're going to help

140
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,500
We're going to be the last

141
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,500
We're going to be here right now

142
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,500
We're going to be in my house

143
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:57,500
We're going to love

144
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,500
And here we go

145
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,500

It is rising, the money's getting low According to our soft saying, the street's the place to go

150
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:00,500
Just a night for the first time

151
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,500
Just about half past ten

152
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:07,500
For the first time in history

153
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:11,500
Gotta start prayin' then

154
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,500

00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:06,780
Lounge, the new Baylani Community Talk Show.

160
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:07,780
If you're not there, we'll hunt you down.

161

We have your numbers.

163
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:11,780
We looked it up on the internet.

164
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:12,780
Hello.

165
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:13,780
We're back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

166
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:14,780
A little bit of retro there.

167
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:18,080
That was one of the first commercials for Orange Lounge Radio we ran on here.

168
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,420
We are having a catastrophe here in studio.

169
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:23,380
This is horrible.

170
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:29,060
Nowhere in this apartment was there a bottle opener anywhere.

171
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,780
Is there screaming coming from the kitchen?

172
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:32,940
No, but Jamie split a nail.

173
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:39,420
Jamie split a nail trying to open a bottle of Guinness with a knife while I'm running

174
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:43,660
around the house trying to find a lighter that I remember once having that had a bottle

175
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,120
opener on the end of it.

176
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,580
And this is the first time that I'm going to regret quitting smoking because if I was

177
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:55,480
still smoking I'd probably still have that lighter on me oh well how you

178
00:14:55,480 --> 00:15:00,680
feeling now that you finally finally by the way Nellie Loki's fiancee ran

179
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:04,760
downstairs and picked up a bottle opener from the neighbors which would have been

180
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:09,160
the smart thing to do in the first place so anyway so Dark Sakura has a Guinness

181
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:14,640
Loki's on the second screwdriver I still double screwdriver I still have

182
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,720
not drank in anything so I've got to go get that Guinness that you opened up for

183
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:26,720
so I'll be back you guys still time I like Guinness the whole bunch yep I do

184
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:38,200
why it better than that camel piss they sell you know cores or whatever dark you

185
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,320
YOU CAN EAT IT WITH A SPOON!

186
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,320
Ew.

187
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,320
Goodness, this is yummy stuff.

188
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,320
No.

189
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,320
Um.

190
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,320
Yeah.

191
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,320
Um.

192
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,880
It's been really hot.

193
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,920
Shit, yeah.

194
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,920
What?

195
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:53,920
Okay.

196
00:15:53,920 --> 00:16:02,880
This is really funny because Xtopher, my roommate, had a crush on the neighbors downstairs.

197
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:08,120
So he had to go downstairs and take the bottle opener back and it's just really funny.

198
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,720
I'm giggling, because it's the first time they've met, so.

199
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,220
Aw.

200
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,120
I expect Barbara Streisand music to start playing in the background.

201
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:17,780
Yeah, it's cute.

202
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:19,200
Anyway, I have Guinness, so.

203
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,680
I've been listening to show tunes in my car.

204
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,080
I got the Spam-A-Lot CD, the Money Python Broadway play.

205
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:29,540
Uh-huh.

206
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:31,420
You're staring at your bottle in winter.

207
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:33,460
It's like I was drinking and nothing was coming out,

208
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:34,420
but it's still foaming.

209
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:34,920
That's why.

210
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,380
Look, it's going to foam over.

211
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:36,880
Anyway.

212
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,880
Flaming is not good on Guinness. You need to pour it in such a way that it doesn't foam.

213
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,880
I'm going to pour it in my mouth pretty soon.

214
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,880
Where's the webcam? It better not be pointing at me.

215
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:46,880
No, it's pointing at me, actually.

216
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,880
Look, Boost.

217
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,880
Here, I can hold it again. Oh shit, my Guinness is going to spill over.

218
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:55,880
Tonight, by the way, if you're looking for a quality show...

219
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,880
Excuse me.

220
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,880
Our show is as good as those fireworks out there.

221
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:07,380
It started off great, but it kind of degrades after, you know, over time.

222
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:09,880
We'll open up the Skype line so you can give your congratulations to us.

223
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,380
We just want it down for your safety.

224
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:12,880
Run down!

225
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,880
Alright, good luck getting the next one open.

226
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,880
That's because I already opened it. Aha!

227
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,880
I told you the one that was already open. I hope you open three.

228
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,880
Okay.

229
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,880
Oh, they gave us the bottle opener. It doesn't matter.

230
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,880
Yeah, no, the neighbors downstairs gave it to us.

231
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,880
They took it back.

232
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,380
Oh.

233
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:30,880
Yeah.

234
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,880
They took it back.

235
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,880
And they said no keep it

236
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:41,840
It's all excited. All right. Anyway, how was your week? How was your day? We'll start off the show with the classic

237
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,760
We weren't here last week. So yeah, we've got two weeks to catch up on what they do last week

238
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,160
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry. We have to do the drunk disclaimer. I'm sorry

239
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,600
We have to start the show the drunk disclaimer boys and girls on myself Loki and dark Sakura all

240
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,800
Indulging in a little bit of liquor tonight

241
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:58,980
But please if you are going to drink drink responsibly which we will be doing for the most part

242
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:02,880
and have a designated driver. We do have several designated drivers tonight.

243
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:07,080
Xtaphir is remaining sober. He will be chauffeuring DarkSakura and I to the club later on,

244
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:10,480
and Loki's significant other Nellie is remaining sober as well.

245
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:15,680
So please, kids, don't drink and drive. And if you do decide to start drinking because of us,

246
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:19,280
please don't tell your parents it was because of us, because the last thing we need is a lawsuit.

247
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:23,280
Blame it on Grand Theft Auto. Yes, blame it on Grand Theft Auto. They'll believe that.

248
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,680
Exactly. Alright, how was your week? How was your day? Um, what was it? My week?

249
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:35,680
What did I do last week? I think I went down and met the Rabbi, I believe that was last week, and we went down to San Francisco and that kind of sucked.

250
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:46,680
Yeah, that's what we did last Sunday. So we did that and that was kind of boring because, you know, San Francisco sucks and it was kind of cold and we went to the Cheesecake Factory and they have lean pizza there.

251
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:51,680
But I guess, you know, they would probably, you know, specialize in cheesecake and not pizza.

252
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:59,680
And then, um, let's see, what else? Oh, I picked up the game, or not God of War, um, Destroy All Humans, and that was a lot of fun.

253
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,680
And, um, I actually beat that game today.

254
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:12,680
And, um, what else? Oh, I got another PSP as a spiff from my work, so now I have two PSPs.

255
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:19,680
And, um, I'm playing this game Dead to Rights Reckoning right now, which is okay.

256
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:23,680
And, uh, no DDR at all.

257
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:30,680
Because, um, I have no computer to play it on my cabinet, because my sister is borrowing my cabinet computer, and that sucks.

258
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,680
Why?

259
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,680
Because she needs a computer for school.

260
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:38,680
And I tried building her one of the really shitty parts I had, and it didn't work, so...

261
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,800
Alas, she had to borrow it.

262
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:45,720
So my cabinet computer is gone for the summer.

263
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:49,520
Oh well. It's not like you were using it anyway.

264
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:53,360
No, I used it once. You built this huge main cabinet. It was a huge deal and you spent

265
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,720
how much money on this main cabinet? About $3,000.

266
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:59,440
Thousands of dollars on this cabinet. And then I think I saw you playing the

267
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,960
Simpsons arcade game once.

268
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,800
I used to play a lot more than that. It's just, you know,

269
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:09,800
What it comes down to right now is just I haven't been able to work on it lately.

270
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:14,800
Once I get more stuff in there like a BeatMania controller or something, it'll be a lot more fun.

271
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:22,800
And I was playing DDR on it, but the problem is I'll have to still mod the pads to ground out the static on them,

272
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:27,800
and then it'll work, and then I can play DDR and get in shape and the whole plan and everything.

273
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,800
But right now it's just, you know...

274
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,800
Are you gonna have a six-pack and all that stuff?

275
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,800
Number three!

276
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:36,880
Wait, how are you on number three already? You drank number one in front of us.

277
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:41,160
Double shot of vodka. Well, in that case, I'm on number four.

278
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:47,160
Double shots count as one beverage because it's in one glass.

279
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:50,400
Okay, then where did number two go? I'm still on number one.

280
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,920
I am on number three. Alright, anyway. Yeah, but where did number two go?

281
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:57,520
I did a double shot of vodka. Oh, well then what's this

282
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:01,080
you're drinking now? Sugar-free Cherry

283
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:07,080
Joan soda, and a double shot of vodka.

284
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:10,080
I can drink vodka straight, thank you.

285
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,080
I'm sorry, uh, MAME CABINET.

286
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,080
Anyways, yeah, so, MAME CAB and the computer are gone. For now.

287
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:18,080
Because Mr. Strasser has to do homework.

288
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:22,080
That's it. That's really all I did this week, is just playing Destroy All Humans.

289
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:27,080
It's a lot of fun throwing people around using psychic abilities.

290
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,080
Especially with the ragdoll physics in that game.

291
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:36,080
It makes for a lot of fun. Like, you can pick up cows and smash them in the stuff and just people and it's a lot of fun. A lot of fun.

292
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:43,080
And, um, so that's pretty much all I've been playing this week and, um, yeah. That's pretty much it.

293
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,080
So, uh, you went and saw The War of the Worlds, right?

294
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,080
Oh, yeah.

295
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,080
How was that?

296
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,080
That was good.

297
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,080
I have no interest in seeing War of the Worlds.

298
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,080
It was good.

299
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:56,080
I know I've been hearing it's really good, but I'm like, uh, Tom Cruise is so 80s.

300
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,080
Who cares about Tom Cruise? Tom Cruise isn't white.

301
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:02,580
And I don't like Spielberg movies either. I really don't like the only Spielberg movie I ever liked.

302
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:03,780
Terminator 2 was fucking awesome!

303
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,780
That was not a Spielberg movie!

304
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,780
Wasn't it? Yeah, well, no, that was Cameron.

305
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:10,780
Steven Spielberg presents Terminator 2.

306
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:12,780
I don't think he'd give Cameron, because he's awesome.

307
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:20,780
T-Term-Termie, can you-can you help me save the world?

308
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:22,280
Yes.

309
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,780
I just do a don't B.R.I.

310
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:32,780
Hey, Terminator, phone home. I'll be back. I don't really want to hurt humans. I just have to because I'm programmed this way.

311
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:36,780
Do you think that the Star Wars movies would have been better if Spielberg had a hand in them?

312
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:42,780
No, they couldn't have. Yes, because anything is better than Lucas. Although, Episode III was pretty cool. I'll give him that.

313
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:45,780
I saw George Lucas and I almost flicked Liz Adam.

314
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:56,360
And first off, people, this is not, you know, this is not, this is not E.T. Spielberg.

315
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,180
This is dual Spielberg.

316
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:00,600
This is like dark Spielberg, okay?

317
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,600
Like evil Spielberg.

318
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,600
Anyways, so, um, do you know who I am?

319
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,680
Do you have a tray?

320
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,680
This is not a game.

321
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,920
Who the fuck are you?

322
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:16,440
i didn't even get back to you

323
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:20,760
anyway if you're going to be a good friend i highly recommend going to see

00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:24,640

other day okay and a great go into this movie knowing it's gonna and book like

328
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:39,160
the original it's not going to be this for the spoilers

329
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:42,720
oh come on it's a goddamn movie you know how it ends

330
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:47,480
i mean come on everyone knows how it ends but it's good okay that's all you need to know

331
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,800
and um...

332
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,920
the only gripe about it is the aliens

333
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,080
were a little too cute

334
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,240
and a little too dumb

335
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:58,280
and and they died when you poured water on them what's up with that

336
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:02,080
they didn't die when you poured water there's water in the atmosphere what the hell that makes no

337
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:06,640
sense at all but they have like cute like faces it's the same thing about about the

338
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,580
wicked witch of the west uh...

339
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:11,920
How could she walk around fucking Oz

340
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:15,840
when there's condensation in the air? How do we know that Oz was based around a

341
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,240
carbon-based, you know...

342
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:22,040
Because it was on fucking Earth that they could freakin' play a balloon to Kansas!

343
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:25,520
And Batman begins... Well Oz is part of Hollywood, dammit!

344
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:29,160
Batman begins, what the fuck? Our bodies are made of water. What the fuck was that?

345
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:32,720
I haven't seen a damn movie, so shut up. I didn't spoil it lately. Have you seen the movie?

346
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,160
What the fuck? Our bodies are made of water. That's a good point. People would explode.

347
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,840
I would have liked that better.

348
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:43,240
I liked Batman Begins because it had the set up of one of the 60's Batmans.

349
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:50,320
Honestly, that would have been great, you know, they have this great plan and stuff.

350
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,680
You know, the vaporized water and whatnot. And then people start explaining, they're

351
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:57,840
all, well that's a good idea. That's an unseen side effect, but okay, hey,

352
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,920
I'm going with it, you know.

353
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:05,160
Poison people, make them explode, whatever, hey, it's the same, you know, consequence.

354
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:08,700
uh... testing

355
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:11,200
doesn't talk about it i think uh...

356
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,480
they need more anyway

357
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,420
uh... anything else to say about your week in a day

358
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:15,960
uh...

359
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:19,880
just pretty much just sticking around the house and in place to surround him

360
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,000
that gives a lot of fun

361
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
i've been playing a game nonstop only two i don't know what about an hour on

362
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,440
podcast well the problem is that by the wages

363
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,280
usually take our podcast right after the show so i'm kinda worried about

364
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:33,360
tonight's pocket i don't care

365
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,360
We'll see.

366
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:38,400
No, but anyways, yeah, Destroy All Humans, awesome game, it's a lot of fun, what's great

367
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:45,920
about it though is one, the main Martian or Furon, the alien race or whatever, is voiced

368
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,360
by the guy that does Invader Zim.

369
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:53,660
So it's Zim, the game is basically Invader Zim the game, it's just awesome, and they've

370
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:58,680
got some other voice actors from other, you know, cartoons out there, I think there's

371
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:02,800
a guy from King of the Hill and some other ones I recognized but I wasn't positive because,

372
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:10,680
You know, I don't remember voice actor names, but Invader Zim Guy, I was like, oh, I love

373
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,680
this game.

374
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:16,040
And it's got, I think, because I didn't really watch the clip all the way, I think you can

375
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:19,840
actually unlock the movie Plan 9 from Outer Space.

376
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:20,840
That's kind of interesting.

377
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:23,120
Yeah, and B movies and stuff.

378
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,600
It's just, the whole game plays like a 50's B movie, and it's great.

379
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,120
It's the best thing.

380
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,120
So.

381
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,120
Alright.

382
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,120
I gotta go get a new drink.

383
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,960
I'm looking at the Malibu pineapple, so Dark Sakura has to tell us about her week while

384
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:35,960
I go do that.

385
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:36,960
I've...

386
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,960
Huh?

387
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:46,440
I spent all week moving my shit from my apartment, which sucks a whole bunch of ass.

388
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:52,040
It sucks an ass larger than that of Roseanne Barr at her biggest.

389
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,920
Or Rosie O'Donnell at current.

390
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:57,040
Oh god, that one was chunky.

391
00:26:57,040 --> 00:27:03,120
Anyway, I've moved all this stuff from the apartment, well Dan and I took two days off,

392
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:08,920
and we got all this stuff from our apartment, and he says it's like a really twisted Christmas

393
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:14,000
where you're opening all these presents that's full of your own shit and you don't know what's

394
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,880
in what box.

395
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:23,460
I've got the kitchen mostly unpacked, and um, I've been working on that today and yesterday

396
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:28,700
And then we got our refrigerator, and we got our washer and dryer, and we spent over $2,700

397
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:29,700
for that set.

398
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:30,700
So you're in a house now?

399
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:31,700
I'm in a house.

400
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:32,700
Awesome.

401
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:33,700
I'm going to be living there for some time.

402
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:38,140
And I'm thinking that we might even move studio, maybe, if everyone's not opposed to it, because

403
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:46,300
I live in citrus heights instead of Rancho, Cambodia.

404
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,300
That happened too.

405
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:48,300
Really?

406
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,300
You don't say?

407
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:52,580
I'm having very juicy burps, and I don't know why.

408
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:54,140
I don't know.

409
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:57,560
Dan's supposed to be here any moment now with my pants.

410
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,820
And...

411
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:01,900
I've got to go downstairs and prepare to be...

412
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:03,300
pretend to be sober.

413
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:06,380
And make it down the stairs. That's going to be fun.

414
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:08,220
Just slide down the rail.

415
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:14,820
We got a 50-inch freaking HD widescreen projection TV.

416
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,380
And this thing...

417
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:18,500
is huge.

418
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,960
It's a very...

419
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,960
Is it 50 inch huge?

420
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,960
It is very satisfying.

421
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:28,960
I could do that. I could ride that thing all night.

422
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:29,960
Or watch it.

423
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:33,960
You could ride. She's gonna ride the TV all night long.

424
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:34,960
Did you hear that?

425
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,960
I'm going to mix it onto the TV.

426
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,960
For those of you keeping drink counts at home,

427
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:44,960
I'm now drinking four shots of Malibu Pineapple mixed with 7-Up.

428
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,960
And I have my DDR ice in there.

429
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:48,960
Taste!

430
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:53,720
i found ice trays at ikea now there are a lot of the i think it's like

431
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:56,800
fish you know the drink is hella good by the way

432
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,980
is that i think that i think the cochran

433
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,080
the ice is kosher

434
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:04,940
i thought that i didn't think of a ramp and that i want was i'm gonna start on

435
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:06,180
them shot

436
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:08,740
five in six i think

437
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:10,400
yeah this is not fair

438
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,400
but i have had uh...

439
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,080
kenneth as well and give me

440
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,400
have given out of the shot i guess

441
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:20,220
because i have going by like you know how they count drinks you know as the

442
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:22,360
shot of alcohol the drink in

443
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:28,000
uh... beer is a drink in whatever else is a glass of wine i guess is a drink so

444
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,360
this one really really and i'm going to get you the on the show

445
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:35,640

447
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:43,040

448
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,500
we can talk extra for into it

449
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:48,620

oh not today your day wasn't good but

456
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,000
my week was spent with

457
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,420
boxes

458
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:09,660
i sleep surrounded by a dirty laundry

459
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:13,740
because all of my laundry is dirty and we haven't had a washing machine

460
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:18,400
which we just got today, and guess what I get to do on the 4th of July?

461
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:18,900
Laundry?!

462
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,240
Laundry Laundry! Whoo!

463
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,840
Shh, I have neighbors, people.

464
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:28,640
I'm sorry for your neighbors, but I have lots of laundry-related aids.

465
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,840
We realize what happens when they give us a can opener.

466
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,840
I mean, come on, our bottle opener.

467
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:37,340
We like you, sexy British man.

468
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:38,740
Shh, Jesus.

469
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:41,240
I don't love this sexy British man. I'm sorry.

470
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,340
that's okay

471
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,900
i would love him for you

472
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,680
okay

473
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,040
alrighty then

474
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,360
i love my dan

475
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:53,440
cause he understands that every so often

476
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,380
if i don't have liquor i'll shrivel up and die

477
00:30:56,380 --> 00:31:01,940
i think if we get a tv show i'm gonna always do it drunk

478
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:04,260
you're gonna sit back and be like

479
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:08,300
i was a little lowkey and i was angry and drunk

480
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:11,900
I want to be wearing like one of those like you know leisure suit not

481
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:15,940
necessarily leisure suit but something like you know Hugh Hefner be wearing you

482
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:21,340
know like a bathrobe and like slippers and be sitting there with a martini some

483
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:27,340
of those hosts on g4 have to be drunk to get through everyone in Hollywood is

484
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:34,340
either drunk or on drugs. Or Lola skates.

485
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:37,340
Lola skates? Lola! Lola skates!

486
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:41,340
I was laughing! Oh my god, isn't the internet a nerd?

487
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:46,340
Oh god. You know what, Rob? That can has been on your desk for a year.

488
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:53,340
Chat room? No it hasn't. Chat room, they said I only had four drinks, but that is one Guinness and four shots.

489
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:56,340
We're even right now, Trevor.

490
00:31:56,340 --> 00:32:02,340
We're going by government drinks, okay? Technically this would be a second drink if I were counting, you know, actual drinks.

491
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:08,340
By actual drink numbers, Rob has had two, Loki has had two, I have had three.

492
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:12,340
By shot, we are all dead tied at five.

493
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:18,340
Well, I'm at four. I'm going to be starting at five in just a second here as soon as I finish the last bit of my drink.

494
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:22,860
And I apologize for belching, but I'm having soda with my vodka right now.

495
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:26,740
Which I... you all know that I am a belch monster already.

496
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:29,860
That is my one highly unfeminine trait.

497
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:33,660
Excuse me while I take a brief recess to get some more alcohol.

498
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:36,980
I also have other unfeminine traits like climbing trees,

499
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:38,920
and shooting people with guns,

500
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:41,540
and driving a tank.

501
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:45,980
It's the adventures of Lo!

502
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:49,100
Oh my god! I could do a webcomic of that!

503
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,420
Wouldn't that be spiking funny?

504
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:54,740
You're gonna do a webcomic? LOL! LOL!

505
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:56,460
No, I forgot!

00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:57,580
You're a burb!

507
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:58,700

510
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:01,620
Burb!

511
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:02,620
Burb!

512
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:07,740
No seriously, I'm gonna do the orange sounds webcomic, but I need someone who does flash.

513
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:10,940
Cause we need to have our fictional studio online.

514
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:14,180
Where everyone can explore and interact with us.

515
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:17,780
Wow

516
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:21,820

517
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:26,440

518
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,560

519
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:30,800

520
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:34,340

521
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:38,360
my ability is not indulging, it's staring at traffic lights

522
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:43,300
No! Who is the diva of this show? I do not believe that it is you

523
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:48,300
I am an internet fucking celebrity.

524
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:52,300
I am not a celebrity who fucks the internet, except for screwing it over.

525
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:57,300
I am an internet celebrity that makes me the diva of the show.

526
00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:00,300
Hello? My power cable just fell out of my lap.

527
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:03,300
I'm an internet celebrity too. I have like 140 friends on my space. Come on.

528
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:04,300
I have to plug myself in again.

529
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:06,300
I have like 140 friends on my space.

530
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:11,300
I joined Myspace a month ago and I have 42 people, including Corey Feldman.

531
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:13,300
Cori Thumbt is my buddy.

532
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:19,300
I want to make a Myspace profile for Adventures of Lol.

533
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,300
I'm sorry.

534
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:23,300
I made an Orange Zones one but I haven't done Chipotle yet.

535
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:25,300
I am not in heat, shut up!

536
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:27,300
If I were in heat you would know.

537
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:30,300
Cause if it wouldn't be you I would be heat-mat.

538
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,300
Wow.

539
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:34,300
Are you finished so I can talk about my week? Cause my week sucked.

540
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:36,300
Fuck your week.

541
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:37,300
Fuck your week?

542
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,300
I'll go to a break bitch.

543
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,300
Turn off your mic.

544
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:50,700
I give you permission to speak, oh, Rob, who sits by the computer, with your legs all crossed.

545
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:54,060
You need a cigarette now, you are so like, you'd be so posh.

546
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:59,380
You were the most supportive of me stopping smoking, and now you're like, you want a cigar

547
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:00,380
tonight?

548
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:01,380
You need a cigarette, Rob?

549
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:03,380
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

550
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:08,260
I do not believe in cigarettes, because cigarettes are very addicting.

551
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:10,580
I do have my secret hidden stash.

552
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:15,380
Clothes I'm fine with, because you best be hooking me up with that.

553
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:23,380
I have found out from my fiancé, he's not really happy about it, but he is okay with

554
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:25,260
me having a cigar every so often.

555
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:30,920
So I picked up a pack of Black & Milds, because they're pipe tobacco, and pipe tobacco is

556
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:31,920
sexy.

557
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,540
We really don't endorse smoking, boys and girls.

558
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:34,540
Don't start.

559
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:35,540
So light them up if you got them!

560
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:36,540
Don't start, kids.

561
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:37,540
It's a nasty habit.

562
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:42,060
habit is a nasty habit and if you have your lungs full a tar will laugh at you

563
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:47,060
when you croak okay tell us about your week Rob I bet it was fascinating no my

564
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:50,860
car was broken into for the second time this week which sucks you should move

565
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:54,820
this time they smashed a window and they took my new stereo that the insurance

566
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:59,100
company had replaced they dug through my car until they found my faceplate I mean

567
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:02,580
okay stupid me for keeping my faceplate in my car but I had it in a secret spot

568
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:06,460
where I didn't think anyone would find it and so I was kind of it I'll get I'll

569
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:08,460
I'll get the fan in a little bit so it cools off in here.

570
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,460
Wait, hold on.

571
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:12,460
I'm giving Jamie some competition.

572
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:14,460
You're red in the face, Oki.

573
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:16,460
Oki, you're red.

574
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:18,460
I'm going to give you my Zoom doll.

575
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:22,460
I have a big plushy Zen pillow.

576
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:24,460
I have a big plushy girl pillow.

577
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:26,460
Oh, our chat room is www.org.com.

578
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:30,460
Why is the chat room saying our stream dropped?

579
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:32,460
No, we're still up. I think it's just one person.

580
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:34,460
We always have it up.

581
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:36,460
I'm always up

582
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:42,800
No, we don't make me waste my body by spitting it on your face. I don't even want to discuss stuff like that

583
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:46,860
Just because yeah, what what happened?

584
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:50,020
Well, it's not what happened. It's

585
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:55,280
We're not gonna go there cuz that's a little you know beyond the show format

586
00:36:55,280 --> 00:37:01,900
Okay, it's not no let's talk about Loki's sex life. It's not a bad thing either. It's good stuff, but okay

587
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:03,380
you know it's just

588
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:07,080
it's it's it's a side effect of having a cold

589
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:09,480
i get a weird side effect

590
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,560
and so

591
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,080
it's just odd

592
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:16,560
we're not going to talk about it okay

593
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:20,800
i don't know what he's laughing about but can we get nellie in here to clarify

594
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,800
i can tell you what it is but i'm not telling you

595
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:27,800
i have a replacement for dunk

596
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,560
what's that

597
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:37,360
Derk. Derk. Alright. Anyway, um, what was all my car got broken into? And this time,

598
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:40,920
instead of just prying open the door, they actually smashed on one of my windows, and

599
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:45,080
the insurance company won't replace my broken window until a week from today. Isn't that

600
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:50,660
stupid? So I'm driving around, oh, and, to add insult to injury, they fucked up my lock

601
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:55,460
on the driver's side, so I can't even open my driver door. So, get into my car, I have

602
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:59,980
to open up the passenger door, climb my fat ass across the seat, and then I get to sit

603
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:00,980
down. It sucks.

604
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:04,020
You sure? Well, do they fuck up the lock on the outside or the lock all together?

605
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:06,860
They fucked it up. I can't open the door from the inside.

606
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:10,460
Yeah, because my old car used to have to pop open the door on the passenger side, unlock

607
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:11,660
the door, and then walk around.

608
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:13,300
No, it won't even work. It won't even work.

609
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:17,820
Because some dumbass tried to open the lock with a screwdriver and that didn't work.

610
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:20,540
My door won't even open from the... I don't even know how they're going to fix it. It'll

611
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:21,540
be incredible.

612
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:25,540
But it's great, though. See, my old car, they were trying to steal the stock stairs.

613
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:27,540
I have to tell something to Illusion real quick.

614
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:28,540
What?

615
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:31,540
MAAAWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!

616
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:33,540
MAAAWWWWWWWWWWWW!

617
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:34,540
Shush!

618
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:36,540
MAAAWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!

619
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:37,540
You have to tell him that you're Cat in Heat?

620
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:40,540
MAAAWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!

621
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:41,540
MAAAWWWWWWWWWWWW!

622
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:44,540
Anyway, in the front room right now. By the way, shut up!

623
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:45,040
MAAAWWWWWWWWWW!

624
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,540
Stop it! I'm gonna set you up!

625
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:48,540
I'm gonna set the ferret on fire.

626
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:49,040
MAAAWWWWWWW!

627
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,540
I don't even know where it is, to be honest.

628
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:51,660
uh...

629
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:53,020
uh...

630
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:53,940
uh...

631
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:55,740
the

632
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:57,780
they're watching a dirty chain

633
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:00,340
i thought it was really very it's great

634
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:01,300
i like it

635
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:03,660
here's my favorite impersonation

636
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:07,860
uh... i thought was my week my car got broken into that some impersonation

637
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:09,020
well i'm not

638
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:12,380
i'll talk about this one of the podcast if i can come up to insanely drunk

639
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:16,420
and i was playing media all all you really got that all it just came out

640
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:21,140
out this past week. Well, I know. It's so hot. I love it. Meteos is like the reason

641
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:29,940
why there's a DS. Meteos makes... I'm gonna shove that thing up your ass. Meteos is the

642
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:34,860
reason why they made a DS, seriously. Like, everything good about the DS technology is

643
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:40,880
used in Meteos. I love it. I want to make sweet love to it and have its babies. And

644
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,880
those babies will be Nintendogs.

645
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:46,880
Hey, hey, illusion, guess what?

646
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:56,360
If I could stab this microphone to my brain, I'd do it right now, but since that's impossible.

647
00:39:56,360 --> 00:40:00,540
To answer a question in chat room, somebody's saying that in response to my car getting

648
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:02,840
broken into, they say, that's what insurance is for.

649
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:06,600
Yeah, well, I still have $100 deductible, which sucks, and they'll probably jack up

650
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:09,320
my rates because it's the second time my car's been broken into.

651
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:12,320
This is because you moved into Rancho, Cambodia.

652
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:18,320
I swear, like, they're trying to...

653
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,320
I don't know.

654
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,320
You're drunk.

655
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:28,320
It's because I fucking drank that double shot as fast as I did.

656
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:31,320
I think we're going to go to break. How's that sound, kids?

657
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,320
I get to pick the songs.

658
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,320
Actually, there's one song I really wanted to play.

659
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,320
Too bad. How does it feel to want it?

660
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:40,320
Well, we had a request from the chat room, so I think we should honor it.

661
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,320
To hear your reign, the original.

662
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,320
Oh, I like your chat room, person.

663
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,320
That was Misty.

664
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,320
Misty, you were awesome.

665
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,320
No, this is good.

666
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,320
I've got music with me.

667
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,320
Because it's a segue.

668
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,320
It's a good segue.

669
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:53,320
Because we're going to talk about Akira Yamamoto when we come back.

670
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,320
If we can't.

671
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:56,320
I need Kotemu Dxy.

672
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,320
If I can find it.

673
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,320
Let's do it again.

674
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,320
All right.

675
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,320
Well, this song's like four minutes, or five minutes.

676
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,320
So we're going to play it.

677
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,320
So we're going to come back and talk about Akira.

678
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:10,320
Do that and then play, um, um, what's that other one, um, the one that's named after

679
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,320
Beatles song.

680
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,320
Let me do it.

681
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,320
I'll see what we can do.

682
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,320
Alright.

683
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,320
We'll get some music and then we'll be back with more Orange on the State.

684
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,640
And we're going to open up the Skype line.

685
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:23,200
So if you guys want to talk to us in our, um, uh, uh, what's the word?

686
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,200
Drunken state?

687
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,200
I guess.

688
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,560
Drunken, inebriated, I don't know, state.

689
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,880
You won't have the opportunity when we come back.

690
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:31,040
Go to OrangeOnTheState.com and click on interact with us.

691
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,480
They said I looked red out there.

692
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,480
Interesting. All right, we'll be back after this.

693
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,480
Uran, the Rage Mix from Akira Yomoka,

694
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,480
because we're going to talk about him when we come back.

695
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,480
Akira.

696
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,480
And how hot he is. We'll be back.

697
00:41:41,480 --> 00:42:10,720
associated with a Fedoke.

698
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:19,480
Dancing alone again, again

699
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:25,480
The rain falling on his hands

700
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:33,480
Are you ready to dance with me?

701
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:39,480
Nobody's showing me how to return from you

702
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:45,480
You give to me, I'm gonna find me

703
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:49,480
There's no stranger we want

704
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:52,480
None of these

705
00:42:52,480 --> 00:43:02,480
Has ever more than you ever bring you down

706
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:12,480
All that I need are some simple love of mine

707
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:20,480
You've touched me by once, it hurts

708
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:26,480
But stay with me, never forget

709
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:30,480
Never again will be

710
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:44,480
I get out of my head and I don't know what I found

711
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:54,480
Over and over, I see you break me down

712
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:09,480
On the sidewalk, on the city, on the streets of the wind

713
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,980
Never see the people goin' nowhere

714
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:15,480
There is no gettin' away

715
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:17,980
So the passion and the love

716
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:20,480
My resistance is waiting

717
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,980
Like a flower in the basement

718
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:28,980
Waiting for our love, yeah

719
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:04,980
And I don't know what I've done

720
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:15,980
Over and over I feel it break me down

721
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:31,980
On the sidewalk of the city Comin' street, just don't remember

722
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:36,980
See the people goin' nowhere See me talkin' no rage

723
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:41,980
Comin' fashion, comin' matters My existence is waiting

724
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:50,980
Like a flower in the basement, waiting for our lonely death

725
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:25,980
Hello, you and I, we're a dream, we're a dream

726
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:29,980
Monday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday

727
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:31,980
With the cynical boom in the back

728
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:34,980
Monday, Friday, Saturday, every night

729
00:47:34,980 --> 00:48:02,980
Oh, you said that I loved you

730
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:06,480
Yeah, I need you

731
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,480
Oh, oh, oh, oh

732
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:11,480
You and I

733
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:14,480
One by one

734
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:18,480
Let it rain

735
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:26,480
Hello out there.

736
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:29,480
This is Rob, but you might know me in the online world as Sky.

737
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:35,480
On June 23rd at 7pm Pacific Time, join Dark Sakura and I for the Orange Lounge,

738
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:37,480
the Bomani Scene's newest talk radio program,

739
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:40,480
where we'll talk about all the latest and everything Bomani.

740
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:47,480
It's a whole show dedicated to those games that we never shut up about.

741
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:54,480
Why the fuck did you play that one?

742
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:55,480
Dark Sakura.

743
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:59,480
Rod, put out your hand.

744
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:01,480
You've been ferreted.

745
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,480
That was funny.

746
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:05,480
Considering that I never...

747
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:15,480
I remember the crap you got for the first time that you played that game.

748
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:18,480
And not just for me, okay? Not just for me.

749
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:23,480
Dark Sakura. You know why I said it that way? Because it's like Coors.

750
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:26,480
No one didn't want to come out.

751
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:27,480
Huh?

752
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:29,480
That burp didn't want to come out.

753
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:31,480
I think we have some new people tuning into the station tonight.

754
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:33,480
How many people? We're not like this all the time, okay?

755
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:36,680
seriously this is one of our like really off nights because we're having our

756
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:40,440
third birthday show tonight we're really drunk I would do this show drunk every

757
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:44,600
week if I could but you realize that we had the iTunes 4.9 roll out this week

758
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:49,400
and they built podcasting into iTunes now so it's been huge for us we have so

759
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:55,440
many more listeners now thanks to iTunes making it really easy to subscribe to

760
00:49:55,440 --> 00:50:01,560
podcast we have like a million listeners. That was a sobering belch. For those of you guys

761
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:06,560
keeping track at home, I am on shots six, seven, eight, and nine in my next drink. Four

762
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:09,480
more shots of- Son of a bitch, I need to catch up. I'm almost

763
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:13,520
down to five and six shots. I'm going to be getting seven and eight.

764
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:19,000
I have to take it easy. And I need to actually visit the potty, because,

765
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,880
you know- Dan is going to be here before too long with

766
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:26,880
my pants. Arkadyum. Arkadyum.

767
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:53,360
Arcanium42 made the funniest joke in the chatroom, Dark Likura.

768
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:56,060
Loki was not a part of the show when we first started.

769
00:50:56,060 --> 00:50:57,660
That's right, I was a guest.

770
00:50:57,660 --> 00:50:59,060
Loki has to wait for his third birthday.

771
00:50:59,060 --> 00:51:00,060
He had to sit on the floor.

772
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:03,460
Loki was a guest host for 19 episodes, and then we were like,

773
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:05,660
well, what the fuck, we'll make him a host.

774
00:51:05,660 --> 00:51:10,060
But I feel bad for Angel, because Angel's now been a guest for probably like 50 shows.

775
00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:11,460
And she stopped showing up, though.

776
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:13,560
Yeah, where is she?

777
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:16,360
She wanted to come tonight, but because of my car break-in,

778
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:18,860
I couldn't provide her transportation after tonight's show.

779
00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:20,060
She's listening, I'm sure.

780
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:21,660
Or she's getting an archive of the show.

781
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:26,660
But now DDR Angel's been sitting on the floor for like 50 episodes and now we're like,

782
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:28,660
oh, three's too many.

783
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:29,660
Sorry, DDR Angel.

784
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:30,660
She's a chronicle.

785
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:31,660
Oh, I'm a chronicle.

786
00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:34,660
Yeah, she's our chronic guest.

787
00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:35,660
The chronic, yo!

788
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:36,660
She's our chronic.

789
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:38,660
She's a blunt, yo.

790
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:40,660
I'm gonna go have more liquor.

791
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:41,660
Alright.

792
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:42,660
Um.

793
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:44,660
I get to pee first!

794
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:48,660
Should I open up the skype line or should I talk about the Akira Yomoka album?

795
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:49,660
Akira Yomoka.

796
00:51:49,660 --> 00:51:50,660
Akira Yomoka.

797
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:55,660
Okuyomoka's getting his own album. It's coming out October 28th in Japan, so you won't be able to...

798
00:51:55,660 --> 00:52:02,660
Okuyomoka, by the way, did the song since last break. Okuyomoka, famous for his DDR music, BeatMania music, as well as Silent Hill.

799
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:07,660
Hello. What else has he done? He did some music for Contra. Contra is Shattered Soldier, yeah.

800
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:12,660
Yeah, and what else has he done? Some Rumble Roses, maybe a little? Rumble Roses, a few songs from that.

801
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:17,660
He didn't do anything for Gradius 5, I don't think. Maybe.

802
00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:23,660
Either way, Akira Yomoka is the fucking man. He's awesome. We love him. And he's hot, to boot.

803
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:34,660
So, he's got an album coming out October 28th, and there's going to be, I think, the interesting thing is that it's going to be twelve tracks, I think, but only like two of them are going to be Bamani songs?

804
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:41,660
Yeah, and they didn't say anything about Silent Hill songs, but of course Silent Hill already has their own soundtrack, so who cares, right?

805
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:49,620
But we have, let's see, two Bamani songs, six cover songs, which could be just about

806
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:50,620
anything.

807
00:52:50,620 --> 00:52:53,740
I know what some of those...

808
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:55,180
Two brand new songs.

809
00:52:55,180 --> 00:52:58,700
I know what some of those cover songs are.

810
00:52:58,700 --> 00:52:59,700
You don't know for sure.

811
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:00,700
You think you might.

812
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:01,700
I suspect.

813
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:05,680
But I can't sing anything, of course.

814
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:09,100
But yeah, I mean, Kiriyama Moku is awesome, so whatever he's going to do is going to be

815
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:10,100
awesome.

816
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:11,100
Yes, that's right.

817
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:14,540
should be fun should be fun

818
00:53:14,540 --> 00:53:17,880
and if you want more information on that Konamistyle.jp has a whole page

819
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:19,280
dedicated to the project

820
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:23,460
so it's pretty awesome so check it out I am really dizzy

821
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:29,580
let's see

822
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:34,500
oh good point from John Fields we can make Angel the intern since Zero doesn't

823
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:35,740
show up to the show anymore

824
00:53:35,740 --> 00:53:39,820
well I thought, wasn't Magus our intern at one point? No he's the eternal freshman of

825
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:40,820
Orange Lounge I forgot

826
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:45,320
He's the keeper of the... what was it? Portuguese joke book?

827
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:48,320
That's right. He's the Portuguese joke book keeper.

828
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:52,320
Oh man. I am... so... dizzy.

829
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:56,320
I thought this was interesting, the story you posted earlier this week.

830
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:59,320
We'll probably talk about this more on the podcast, but the PlayStation 3?

831
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:02,320
Four hundred dollars to buy a PlayStation 3?

832
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:04,320
Is it going to do my dishes?

833
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:06,320
If not, fuck it.

834
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:10,320
Well, you do have to understand the Xbox 360 games are sixty bucks each.

835
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:14,320
Oh my, that is insane. That is insane.

836
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:18,320
I mean, D of A is pretty cool, or D of A, it's like a bank suddenly.

837
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:23,320
D or A, Dead or Alive, is pretty cool, but it's not $60 cool.

838
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:30,320
No, it's not. And this is what I've got from like, you know, basically looking at the release dates we have for the

839
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:32,320
I found my special though.

840
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:33,320
That's cute.

841
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:37,200
for the Xbox game. Actually, from what we've seen so far from what the

842
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:40,040
publishers are telling us, but they're going to release their games and those are the

843
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:41,200
launch games, of course.

844
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:45,000
The Xbox 360 is supposed to be coming out around

845
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,180
November 15th.

846
00:54:47,180 --> 00:54:51,360
Around the 15th. You work for a distributor. Yes, I do. So you get the inside scoop on

847
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:51,800
when the

848
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:53,720
app's coming out. Yes, I do.

849
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:58,640
And so, yeah, it's going to be about $60 a game for the Xbox 360.

850
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:03,080
I can only assume that the PlayStation 3 stuff is going to be about the same price. If they wanted to be cute,

851
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:07,740
since it's 360, they release it on March 60th.

852
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:08,740
I don't think so.

853
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:09,740
That's not gonna happen.

854
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:14,020
No, they're gonna release it on November, like, 16th or 15th.

855
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:15,020
It's around there.

856
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:19,020
I mean, because obviously dates change for the games a lot, so it's, you know, it's up

857
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:23,460
in the air, but most of the publishers are saying that's gonna happen at that date.

858
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:27,660
In our chatroom, Baka is saying that the games on PS3 are gonna be $60, too.

859
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:28,660
Yeah, so, when we...

860
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:32,380
Well, what the fuck is up with that, $60 for a game?

861
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:34,380
I'm not going to spend $60 on a game.

862
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:36,380
It's $10 more than what they're charging right now, so...

863
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:38,380
Fuck that shit. I don't spend $50 on a game either.

864
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:40,380
I know, but you know what?

865
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:44,380
I spent $35 on Meteos, and that was like having to give up a finger.

866
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:49,380
Well, you know, most PlayStation 2 games are, like, $49.99.

867
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:50,380
No.

868
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:51,380
Not when I buy them.

869
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:52,380
I have Guinness now.

870
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:53,380
Well, you know, they are.

871
00:55:53,380 --> 00:55:55,380
And they wonder why people try to pirate their games.

872
00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:57,380
$50 for a game?

873
00:55:57,380 --> 00:55:59,380
What about Katamari Damacy?

874
00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:01,380
Great game, $20, sold zillions of copies.

875
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:07,500
of copy. $20. That should be a model for all games. Second game, though, is $29.99. I think

876
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:12,660
for you it's $10, so... But still, though, it's worth the extra $10. It's still not,

877
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:18,940
you know, $44. No, it's not. Not if they're putting out games like... I don't know. What's

878
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:26,500
a game that sucked on PlayStation? Um... Driver 3. Okay, Driver 3. Yeah, I'm gonna pay $60

879
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:28,700
for driver four

880
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:32,420
could you know i think the i would pay sixty bucks for final fantasy twelve

881
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:35,060
although that's why i was really in the driver series

882
00:56:35,060 --> 00:56:37,060
sucked after you know the first

883
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:37,900
first game

884
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:42,940
the second game just sucked ass in third game was simple or it was so bad it was

885
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:43,900
funny

886
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:45,260
but um...

887
00:56:45,260 --> 00:56:49,480
i don't know it's just you know they think they can justify that amount you

888
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:51,520
know for the next-gen consoles because

889
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:54,500
the graphics are better

890
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:59,500
Game companies, this is why people hack your shit, because you're charging too much for your damn games.

891
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:04,500
It probably costs more to actually make these games.

892
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:09,500
And part of the cost involved...

893
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:13,500
Let me finish my damn sentence, thank you.

894
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:21,500
Part of the cost involved with the creation of the games also has to do with, you know, fighting loss of profit.

895
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:23,500
They have to make

896
00:57:23,820 --> 00:57:29,340
For company to be considered successful. They have to make a certain amount over production cost

897
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:38,820
Therefore if they are they're trying to accommodate for what they have already lost versus what they may stand to lose and do their prices accordingly

898
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:44,400
Therefore a $10 markup in price is not unreasonable nor is it unexpected

899
00:57:45,220 --> 00:57:49,860
What other things could I buy for $60 all the liquor I bought tonight was $40

900
00:57:49,860 --> 00:57:52,420
that's more fun than driver three

901
00:57:52,420 --> 00:57:56,240
okay cuz basically games have been about fifty bucks since

902
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:57,700
even the super nintendo

903
00:57:57,700 --> 00:58:01,220
that's been my i remember when my body was more street fighter was like a

904
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:03,180
seventy dollar game

905
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:07,620
yeah that's ridiculous i could get a gay cube i could get a game cube for

906
00:58:07,620 --> 00:58:11,380
seventy dollars that's ridiculous for a street fighter being that expensive

907
00:58:11,380 --> 00:58:14,580
but i remember most of my like you know super nintendo games being about you

908
00:58:14,580 --> 00:58:16,340
know forty nine ninety nine so i mean

909
00:58:16,340 --> 00:58:19,540
But it hasn't really changed that much since then.

910
00:58:19,540 --> 00:58:23,140
Granted, you know... I paid $60 for Killer Instinct when it came out on the Super Nintendo.

911
00:58:23,140 --> 00:58:25,060
That's bullshit.

912
00:58:25,060 --> 00:58:31,980
That was a shitty port. This was ten years ago that I bought this damn game.

913
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:35,680
Yeah, with inflation and everything, that's like $80. Yeah, but seriously though,

914
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:38,820
$60 isn't that bad. I mean, when you consider it...

915
00:58:38,820 --> 00:58:40,020
I mean,

916
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:44,380
the system being $400, yeah, that kind of sucks.

917
00:58:44,380 --> 00:58:47,900
I would hope that this would be a little bit better than, you know, it's going to be playing

918
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:53,460
the next-gen, like, whatever the media is going to be, like, HD DVD or Blu-ray or whatever.

919
00:58:53,460 --> 00:58:58,500
It's going to be playing that. So you've basically got, you know, next-gen players in that sense.

920
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:03,340
You've also got, and I don't understand this, you know, PlayStation 3 for some reason had,

921
00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:07,920
like, three Ethernet ports on there. I don't know what the hell that's for, but I'm sure

922
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:13,460
they're going to use it for something. And, I don't know, I think, you know, $3.99 for

923
00:59:13,460 --> 00:59:17,340
the system isn't that bad. People are going to be like, eh, it's kind of expensive, but

924
00:59:17,340 --> 00:59:20,700
they're going to pay for it. But the revolution, though, they're saying is going to be cheaper,

925
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:27,700
much like how, you know, the DS was only $151, the PSP was, like, you know, $300, you know.

926
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:32,260
So, you know, people might, if they're really, you know, concerned about cost, they'll pay

927
00:59:32,260 --> 00:59:37,420
for the, you know, the revolution versus the PS3 or the 360.

928
00:59:37,420 --> 00:59:40,500
I want to read some comments from the chat room. Moreinsolventradio.com, click on chat.

929
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:44,820
I gotta go get more alcohol because I'm dizzy as hell, and if I drink some more, I might

930
00:59:44,820 --> 00:59:45,820
pass out.

931
00:59:45,820 --> 00:59:46,820
That'd be good.

932
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:56,700
Sacorina says, I could buy a lot of Kleenex for $60 and could have more fun than Driver

933
00:59:56,700 --> 00:59:57,780
3.

934
00:59:57,780 --> 00:59:58,780
I agree.

935
00:59:58,780 --> 01:00:02,700
I could buy toilet paper and make a mess of somebody's lawn, and that would be more fun

936
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:03,900
than Driver 3.

937
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:05,900
I grabbed my booze instead of my microphone.

938
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:07,900
What's wrong with this picture?

939
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:08,900
That's good.

940
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:11,900
I could wipe my ass and have more fun than drive for three weeks.

941
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:17,500
Arkadian42, now DarkSagre, you're the resident Sega whore, our resident Sega man whore in

942
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:19,980
the chat room, actually I think there's two of them because I think John Fields is a big

943
01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:25,120
Sega man whore too, but the other one that I know of, this local Arkadian42, huge Sega

944
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:29,460
man whore, says that Phantasy Star IV was $100 when it first came out.

945
01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:30,460
Is that true?

946
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:31,460
For real?

947
01:00:31,460 --> 01:00:32,460
I think so.

948
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:33,600
I did it in a genesis at the time.

949
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:38,600
That's crazy.

950
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:41,040
Final Fantasy II was $80, says John Fields.

951
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:42,040
I think that's right.

952
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:43,880
I think I remember paying like $70.

953
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:47,440
For why I didn't pay it, I begged my mommy, because I got straight A's.

954
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:50,880
You little nerdlet.

955
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:52,360
I got straight A's.

956
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:55,960
No, you want to hear about my junior high school experience and straight A's?

957
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:58,040
I got all A's.

958
01:00:58,040 --> 01:01:02,600
My first semester of junior high school, I got all A's and a B and P.E.

959
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:04,920
But my parents never cared about P.E., so they always threw that out.

960
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:06,000
They didn't count that.

961
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:15,440
my mom would go, you got an A- in math? You know what I got? A D and a C because I didn't

962
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:23,720
give a fuck. My school bored me, and I would make A's on all of my tests, but get zeros

963
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:27,720
for homework because I wouldn't fucking do it. That was me too. I never did my homework.

964
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:32,560
I was a bad boy. That first semester junior high, I went all downhill from there. I just

965
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:36,600
started not doing homework and stuff and I slacked off and and look where I'm at

966
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:42,700
now kids I I'm on an internet radio station you want to be like me we're

967
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:49,840
fucking celebrities cuz we didn't do well in school baka wants to know how I

968
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:55,880
got a B and PE because my mom I could run a mile in like 14 minutes that's how

969
01:01:55,880 --> 01:02:01,920
I got a B and PE my best friend in junior high and I used to walk the mile

970
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:05,580
every day. We would run until the teacher couldn't see us anymore, then we'd walk the

971
01:02:05,580 --> 01:02:10,320
rest of it. It's awesome. One time, just to prove I could do it, I sprinted

972
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:19,400
a half mile just to prove I could do it. I would barf if I ever tried that. It'd be horrible.

973
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:25,200
I ran for it. I was so tired by the time I got there. But I beat everybody, damn it.

974
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:31,540
And now I can't run because I'm injured. I have to make an announcement here. I think

975
01:02:31,540 --> 01:02:34,380
if the site's still up right now, because the site's been going like up and down. Oh,

976
01:02:34,380 --> 01:02:43,900
never mind. Never mind. I'll talk about it later. It's down. Let's go to... Baka says

977
01:02:43,900 --> 01:02:52,500
I'm in the chat room. Baka in our chat room says, and our chat room's over at www.orangeloungeradio.com.

978
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:59,140
Click on, what is it, chat? Baka says... I cannot believe that you were drunk off of

979
01:02:59,140 --> 01:03:06,580
Baka says, I'm Asian. I get 3.6s and 4.0s. I want to hear from an Asian who gets shitty

980
01:03:06,580 --> 01:03:11,420
grades. Seriously. I want to hear from somebody who defies the stereotype and gets like Cs

981
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:16,140
and Ds. Because that's a messed up stereotype that all Asians get like good grades. Surely

982
01:03:16,140 --> 01:03:24,660
there's a flunky Asian out there somewhere and I want to hear from them. www.orangelantradio.com

986
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:45,220
him talking about puking too. Hey, somebody in our chat room disputing us there. It's

987

01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:29,520
Shut up, shut up.

1004
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:31,520
She's still smoking and pregnant!

1005
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:34,520
Loki, for those, uh, keeping drink tally at home, what are you on now?

1006
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:36,020
I'm on 7 and 8.

1007
01:04:36,020 --> 01:04:37,020
We're getting a call.

1008
01:04:38,020 --> 01:04:41,020
7 and 8 and I'm very, very, very dizzy.

1009
01:04:41,020 --> 01:04:42,020
Let's go to the phone lines.

1010
01:04:42,020 --> 01:04:43,520
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1011
01:04:44,020 --> 01:04:45,020
Hey Sky, Siggy here.

1012
01:04:45,020 --> 01:04:47,020
Hi Siggy, how are you?

1013
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:50,520
I'm doing fine, uh, happy birthday, O.L.R.

1014
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:52,520
Thank you, appreciate it.

1015
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:54,520
Rob is sounding especially gay today.

1016
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:57,520
We're potty trained now, we're three years old and we're learning how to read.

1017
01:04:57,520 --> 01:05:00,520
I'm a big kid now.

1018
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:02,520
What's on your mind, Siggy?

1019
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:05,520
Have a drink with us, Siggy. Are you 21?

1020
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:07,520
Well, I'm 25.

1021
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:09,520
Good, have a drink with us, Siggy.

1022
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:11,520
Well, I'd rather have sake, thank you.

1023
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:12,520
Oh, okay.

1024
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:14,520
I want some sake.

1025
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:16,520
It's too expensive, I couldn't buy that.

1026
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:18,520
I want sake, I'm only 30!

1027
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:23,520
Sock you, lady. Alright, what's up, Ziggy? What's on your mind?

1028
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:28,520
Oh, I got some, uh, an announcement, uh, regarding the magnitude of X12, Happy Sky.

1029
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:32,520
I was gonna say, you have some news on Happy Sky, don't you? What's up with Happy Sky?

1030
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:38,520
Uh, it's gonna, uh, in Japan it's gonna be released July 13th, which is gonna be nine days from now.

1031
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:43,520
Ooh, that's soon. That's awesome. Are there any, like, new songs that are supposed to be in the final release?

1032
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:48,520
Because you know how sometimes there's songs in the final release that weren't in the beta test?

1033
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:51,520
Are they doing any of that?

1034
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:59,520
They're already done with the location test, but there haven't been any new songs announced as of late.

1035
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:03,520
That would be great if there was a couple more new ones, though.

1036
01:06:04,520 --> 01:06:05,520
Yeah.

1037
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:14,520
And then some other news. I don't think this has been announced, but Konami has already made their own record label.

1038
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:15,520
Really, huh?

1039
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:17,520
Yeah, it's called a 573 Records.

1040
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:20,520
That is the most awesome name ever.

1041
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:21,520
I'm not surprised.

1042
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:22,520
I have hiccups now.

1043
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:25,520
Is that what's labeled the Kiriyama Oak album is going to come out on?

1044
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:26,520
My hands know.

1045
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:35,520
I'm not sure, but when I checked the website for 573 Records, there are mostly hip hop and R&B artists that have signed up for it.

1046
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:37,520
What's the website?

1047
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:41,520
Here it is. Let me link it on the chat room.

1048
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:43,520
Okay, super. Thank you.

1049
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:52,520
You know, all this talk about Japanese music has me thinking about, did you hear about those huge Live 8 concerts that were going on yesterday?

1050
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:53,520
Yeah.

1051
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:55,520

01:07:28,100 --> 01:07:30,520
on the U.S. site but there are U.S.

1065
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:34,240

Yeah, I heard about it, but

1095
01:09:12,300 --> 01:09:20,300
You know, if I'm going to do any type of, like, three-panel dancing or anything like that, it's going to be, like, from Dance FM or something like that, or whatever that is.

1096
01:09:21,300 --> 01:09:25,300
I'm not Dance FM. Um, Neon FM. That's what I meant.

1097
01:09:29,300 --> 01:09:31,300
My brain feels numb.

1098
01:09:31,300 --> 01:09:35,300
I know. Um, Ziggy, we got other people calling in, so I'm going to let you go. Is there anything else you want to share with us?

1099
01:09:35,300 --> 01:09:36,300
That's all right.

1100
01:09:37,300 --> 01:09:38,300
Hello?

1101
01:09:38,300 --> 01:09:39,300

01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:40,300
Okay.

1103
01:09:40,300 --> 01:09:44,800

Yeah, over a year.

1105
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:51,800
You know what you guys, here's something I gotta mention, and you know, I've been meaning to do this for a while.

1106

Iron Man, didn't you take a tour of tech TV when you were out here and you were talking about how, like, awesome tech TV was, and then they got sold like the next day?

1144
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:42,600
I did, and I was really upset when G4 brought him out.

It was more like a year, but yeah.

1150
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:00,600
I was hoping to get a job there, but I guess not.

1151
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:02,600
Did you say get a job with PETA?

1152
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:04,600
No, it's G4.

1153
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:05,600
Oh.

1154
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:07,600
Actually, you know what's really funny? This brings up a good point.

1155
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:10,600
This is a good segue, because somebody's chatting with me in private message right now.

1156
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:12,600
John, I don't mean to interrupt you, but you'll like this too.

1157
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:13,600
That's fine.

1158
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:17,600
Okay, DeepThought42 in our chat room, who I think might be a new listener.

1159
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:20,600
I don't recognize the name, but then again, I'm drunk, so I apologize.

1160
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:23,600
And you're talking, you've got a speaker way too loud.

1161
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:24,600
I'm sorry.

1162
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:31,440
Um, DeepThought42 was saying that on Attack of the Show, I guess they're looking for co-hosts

1163
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:32,440
Really?

1164
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:38,240
Right now, and he sent them an email saying that we should do it.

1165
01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:40,360
So I think the rest of you guys should send them an email.

1166
01:13:40,360 --> 01:13:42,040
Oh my god, that'd be awesome.

1167
01:13:42,040 --> 01:13:47,120
If you want to know where to send that email, ask DeepThought42, because he knows.

1168
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:50,040
And send them an email saying that we should host.

1169
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:53,800
Although seriously, like, what if he sent that email last week and now they're listening

1170
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:56,880
tonight and we're all just fucked up out of our minds?

1171
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:58,520
They would totally are in.

1172
01:13:58,520 --> 01:14:00,160
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1173
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:04,400
This is our opportunity that we can prove that we fit in in Hollywood because we can

1174
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:06,520
perform drunk or on drugs.

1175
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:07,800
Dude, I am like-

1176
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:08,800
No, we don't do drugs.

1177
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:09,800
I don't do drugs.

1178
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:10,800
I don't do drugs.

1179
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:11,800
Drugs are not cool.

1180
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:12,800
I do Vicodin.

1181
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:13,800
But I'm not a prescription for Vicodin.

1182
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:18,000
I don't do drugs because I have- I can't swallow pills and I have a phobia with needles.

1183
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:23,080
So the drugs are out of the picture, but alcohol is perfectly fine.

1184
01:14:23,080 --> 01:14:24,760
Alright, awesome.

1185
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:27,600
So anyway, I'm sorry John, what was your, why did you call in anyway?

1186
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:28,600
What's on your mind?

1187
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:29,600
Before we...

1188
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:30,600
Well I've got two things.

1189
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:31,600
Okay.

1190
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:36,160
First I'd like to reflect on one of my favorite memories, and that was actually when Karaoke

1191
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:37,160
Revolution...

1192
01:14:37,160 --> 01:14:38,160
Oh God!

1193
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:39,160
No!

1194
01:14:39,160 --> 01:14:44,040
Karaoke was singing, what was it, It's the End of the World, and then also I'm Staying

1195
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:46,320
In or whatever it was.

1196
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:47,320
That show was awesome.

1197
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:53,000
It was I'm Seeing In and it was, what was the other one, I want to say it was Complicated

1198
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:54,000
or something.

1199
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,000
Yeah, it was awesome.

1200
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:58,400
It was, there's another one that Nellie was talking about yesterday.

1201
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:04,800
It was, oh god, I don't remember the song, never mind, I'm not even going to remember

1202
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:05,800
it.

1203
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:09,520
There was another song that she was saying that she was being in Karaoke Revolution and

1204
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:15,240
it was funny but, never mind, I can't remember it so, I'm not going to, yeah.

1205
01:15:15,240 --> 01:15:20,240
That was one of my favorite shows, too, because any time Loki makes an ass out of himself is a good show to me.

1206
01:15:20,240 --> 01:15:24,240
Well, you know, Karaoke Revolution Party Edition is going to be coming out in, I think, September.

1207
01:15:24,240 --> 01:15:26,240
We are all over that shit, too, in September.

1208
01:15:26,240 --> 01:15:34,240
No, no, not September. I'm sorry. It would be November. Actually, the same day, I think, Ultra Mix 3 is coming out.

1209
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:38,240
It will be November, I want to say, 23rd or something like that.

1210
01:15:38,240 --> 01:15:44,240
That's going to be when Karaoke Revolution Party Edition is going to be coming out for all three systems.

1211
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:47,360
That's scary.

1212
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:52,880
Okay, so I'm trying to find a clip of that episode where he's singing, but I'm

1213
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:55,000
so drunk I can't navigate my computer right now.

1214
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:58,800
So I'll keep looking on it. I'll find one on my computer. I think I got one.

1215
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:02,840
That'd be awesome. It feels like someone was shot and Nova came straight into my brain.

1216
01:16:02,840 --> 01:16:06,080
Somebody had it uploaded somewhere, so we gotta find that somewhere.

1217
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:09,320
I only have... the only

1218
01:16:09,320 --> 01:16:14,080
Loki sound clip I have is somewhere else. I can't even...

1219
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:15,640
God, this is horrible.

1220
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:18,340
Okay, what's your other thing you wanted to call about, John?

1221
01:16:18,340 --> 01:16:23,020
Well, I need to make an announcement, actually. As you all know, I am a huge

1222
01:16:23,020 --> 01:16:28,760
fantasy star online whore, and after all the success that Red vs. Blue has had,

1223
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:31,840
I have decided to start my own machinima

1224
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:35,440
based on fantasy star online. So you're going to do, like, a fantasy star version of Red vs. Blue?

1225
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:41,360
You have to play PSO on P... Rob, turn the speaker down. I'm sorry. That's the only way I can hear the Skype.

1226
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:42,360
Well, you need to...

1227
01:16:42,360 --> 01:16:43,360
Here, it's down.

1228
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:44,360
It's down.

1229
01:16:44,360 --> 01:16:47,360
You need to play PSO with me.

1230
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:49,360
Okay, now I can hear.

1231
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:50,360
Johnny there?

1232
01:16:50,360 --> 01:16:51,360
Yeah, I am.

1233
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:52,360
Oh.

1234
01:16:52,360 --> 01:16:56,840
Basically, it's really in the early production stages, but I've worked out how I'm going

1235
01:16:56,840 --> 01:17:03,200
to make the camera work, and at this point, I'm actually trying to figure out how to get

1236
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:08,120
the characters that aren't androids to actually move their mouths.

1237
01:17:08,120 --> 01:17:14,620
And I found someone that managed to do that, but he got a little scared after he saw how

1238
01:17:14,620 --> 01:17:16,540
much work there was.

1239
01:17:16,540 --> 01:17:21,980
But I'm going to post him what he showed me in the chat room as well.

1240
01:17:21,980 --> 01:17:29,080
So if anybody wants to sign on and help make this a reality, I'm asking for any help I

1241
01:17:29,080 --> 01:17:30,080
can get at this point.

1242
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:31,340
John, more power to you.

1243
01:17:31,340 --> 01:17:34,080
Red vs. Blue is hilarious, and PSO is a great game.

1244
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:37,060
So any luck that you have with this, I think it would be awesome.

1245
01:17:37,060 --> 01:17:42,060
So plug away in our chat room, and chatters, help John out, because this is a good project.

1246
01:17:42,060 --> 01:17:43,060
Definitely.

1247
01:17:43,060 --> 01:17:48,060
I wanted to participate in this, because I think that being the diva I am, I must be

1248
01:17:48,060 --> 01:17:49,060
involved.

1249
01:17:49,060 --> 01:17:52,420
Well, and also, I mean, especially, I mean, look at Red vs. Blue, they're basically now

1250
01:17:52,420 --> 01:17:56,300
a spokesperson for like Halo and stuff, I mean, that's awesome, and you've-

1251
01:17:56,300 --> 01:17:59,860
John, you could be the Sega spokesperson, would that just not make you a happy little

1252
01:17:59,860 --> 01:18:01,140
fanboy or what?

1253
01:18:01,140 --> 01:18:04,460
Well, I applied to be a GM last year, but that didn't work out.

1254
01:18:04,460 --> 01:18:05,460
Oh my god.

1255
01:18:05,460 --> 01:18:06,460
That's as close as I'm gonna get.

1256
01:18:06,460 --> 01:18:17,460
You know what? I actually have a business card, or at least I had a business card, for a guy that was the Halo, or not the Halo, the 188, so drunk.

1257
01:18:17,460 --> 01:18:33,460
Anyways, no, no, the Sega guy that was the, um, I want to say the production manager there at Sega that they won, um, I met them at, um, what was it, one of these, um, like film festivals or whatnot, and they were talking about video games and whatnot, and they were there.

1258
01:18:33,460 --> 01:18:38,460
But actually, the guy at Sega, he gave me his card and whatnot to contact him.

1259
01:18:38,460 --> 01:18:45,460
I was supposed to have a meeting with him about some idea I had for some game, but then after a while I thought,

1260
01:18:45,460 --> 01:18:50,460
nah, it's not going to be a good game idea, so I didn't end up calling him back.

1261
01:18:50,460 --> 01:18:53,460
Let's see if I can find that card somewhere.

1262
01:18:53,460 --> 01:18:58,460
Alright, and I've actually spoken with one of the GMs already about this project, and he's really interested,

1263
01:18:58,460 --> 01:19:01,460
so hopefully I'll get the support of Sega behind me as well on this one.

1264
01:19:01,460 --> 01:19:06,940
Good John make it happen. You've got our support. We'll plug it on the podcast or something. All right. All right

1265
01:19:06,940 --> 01:19:08,940
Thank you. Have a good one John. Thanks for calling in

1266
01:19:09,300 --> 01:19:14,260
Okay, and once again happy third answer. Thank you. And thanks for supporting us over the past couple years. We appreciate it

1267
01:19:14,660 --> 01:19:16,660
Okay, have a super day

1268
01:19:17,220 --> 01:19:20,300
Later hold on. I have that Loki sound clip you guys

1269
01:19:20,300 --> 01:19:29,300
Stop. God. Damn. Ow my foot! Why did I shoot myself in my foot? Oh my god, it hurts so bad!

1270
01:19:29,300 --> 01:19:31,300
I need that for walking!

1271
01:19:31,300 --> 01:19:35,300
No! My foot! I need that for walking!

1272
01:19:35,300 --> 01:19:44,300
I just want to point out, somebody named Bamani K just joined our chat room, and I'm thinking if you gave your computer to your sister...

1273
01:19:44,300 --> 01:19:49,300
She's not joining the chat room. She doesn't even know. She's on dial-up. Come on now.

1274
01:19:49,300 --> 01:19:56,260
now. Somebody named Bamani K just joined the chatroom and says, hi, Loki, we love you.

1275
01:19:56,260 --> 01:20:03,140
It's not her, trust me. No, I said, is that Loki's sister? And they said, yup, and family

1276
01:20:03,140 --> 01:20:11,820
is listening. She is not, it is not her, trust me. My family, first off, no, it's not even

1277
01:20:11,820 --> 01:20:18,540
her. You are so screwed if that person's telling you. It is not her! They're telling me yes

1278
01:20:18,540 --> 01:20:25,540
No, it's not my sister. First off, okay, first off, she's on dial-up, okay? That's for one.

1279
01:20:25,540 --> 01:20:26,540
You could join a chairroom in dial-up.

1280
01:20:26,540 --> 01:20:31,540
And first, and second, okay, um, she doesn't know how to use the damn IRC anyway.

1281
01:20:31,540 --> 01:20:32,540
What if she, what if she learned?

1282
01:20:32,540 --> 01:20:36,540
She doesn't know how to use the internet? Come on now!

1283
01:20:36,540 --> 01:20:37,540
Okay.

1284
01:20:37,540 --> 01:20:40,540
She uses Juno to connect to the goddamn internet, okay?

1285
01:20:40,540 --> 01:20:45,540
But, Monty Cade, you've gotta, you've gotta say something that only Loki would know, and then I'm gonna

1286
01:20:45,540 --> 01:20:47,540
I can't even read the chat room right now.

1287
01:20:47,540 --> 01:20:49,540
I'm gonna pee my pants laughing. I will say it on air.

1288
01:20:49,540 --> 01:20:51,540
I am so drunk, I can't even see the chat room.

1289
01:20:51,540 --> 01:20:53,540
It's just like a bunch of blur.

1290
01:20:53,540 --> 01:20:55,540
I need to finish my drink and get another one.

1291
01:20:55,540 --> 01:20:57,540
Your whole family is listening to you.

1292
01:20:57,540 --> 01:20:59,540
They are not listening to me right now.

1293
01:20:59,540 --> 01:21:01,540
You might want to cut it off.

1294
01:21:01,540 --> 01:21:03,540
They are not listening to me right now.

1295
01:21:03,540 --> 01:21:05,540
They have better things to be...

1296
01:21:05,540 --> 01:21:07,540
They've been watching like, you know, some movie or something.

1297
01:21:07,540 --> 01:21:09,540
They're not listening to my god damn show.

1298
01:21:09,540 --> 01:21:11,540
I can't even... Okay.

1299
01:21:11,540 --> 01:21:13,540
Where is the money?

1300
01:21:13,540 --> 01:21:17,820
He goes to the mom, Gma, Gpa, and sis listening.

1301
01:21:17,820 --> 01:21:20,820
Oh god, I'm gonna cry.

1302
01:21:20,820 --> 01:21:30,420
Well, you know what, that could be them because my grandma and grandpa are at my mom's house.

1303
01:21:30,420 --> 01:21:32,300
You are so screwed.

1304
01:21:32,300 --> 01:21:41,180
Well, if that's the case, hello family, I am drinking right now and I am-

1305
01:21:41,180 --> 01:21:43,180
I'm being responsible, he has a designated driver here.

1306
01:21:43,180 --> 01:21:45,180
I have a designated driver, and I am quite...

1307
01:21:45,180 --> 01:21:47,180
This is all a ratings stunt.

1308
01:21:47,180 --> 01:21:50,180
Hey, DarkSocker, get this, Loki's family is listening right now.

1309
01:21:50,180 --> 01:21:53,180
Designated driver three?

1310
01:21:53,180 --> 01:21:55,180
Sit down.

1311
01:21:55,180 --> 01:21:57,180
Anyway, we have somebody on the phone.

1312
01:21:57,180 --> 01:21:59,180
Run, Sean!

1313
01:21:59,180 --> 01:22:02,180
Oh, Bamani Kate says, how's, how's Tutor Train?

1314
01:22:02,180 --> 01:22:04,180
This is my favorite show ever.

1315
01:22:04,180 --> 01:22:06,180
Is Tutor Train a reference?

1316
01:22:06,180 --> 01:22:08,180
Tutor Train? What the fuck is that?

1317
01:22:08,180 --> 01:22:10,180
Run, Sean, don't lie, Sean.

1318
01:22:10,180 --> 01:22:13,180
Your grandparents are listening, don't say that word!

1319
01:22:13,180 --> 01:22:16,180
I can't read this stuff, it's too small!

1320
01:22:16,180 --> 01:22:17,180
It's supposed to be shut up.

1321
01:22:17,180 --> 01:22:19,180
Okay, I will kill our car.

1322
01:22:19,180 --> 01:22:22,180

01:22:23,180 --> 01:22:26,180

1329
01:22:33,180 --> 01:22:36,180

1332
01:22:44,180 --> 01:22:47,620

1333
01:22:47,620 --> 01:22:49,300
Wait, no four drinks.

1334
01:22:49,300 --> 01:22:50,300

1335
01:22:50,300 --> 01:22:54,340

Wait wait wait, Loki.

1338
01:22:58,700 --> 01:23:02,620
Tutor train is the one you use to push in your power suit.

1339
01:23:02,620 --> 01:23:06,580
Oh my god.

1340

I'm gonna go get more liquor and I'll be right back.

1363
01:24:05,780 --> 01:24:06,780
Ramo, what's on your mind?

1364
01:24:06,780 --> 01:24:09,780
Not much. Um, I want to talk about the DOA movie.

1365
01:24:09,780 --> 01:24:11,780
Yes, the DOA movie. What's up?

1366
01:24:11,780 --> 01:24:17,780
The guy that's playing Ryu Hayabusa, Ken Kosugi. Do you know who his father is?

1367
01:24:17,780 --> 01:24:20,780
Oh, I'm sorry, what?

1368
01:24:20,780 --> 01:24:22,780
Do you know who his father is?

1369
01:24:22,780 --> 01:24:23,780
No, who?

1370
01:24:23,780 --> 01:24:30,780
Sho Kosugi. He did all those ninja movies from the 80s, and he also helped put together Ten-

1371
01:24:30,780 --> 01:24:34,660
Wait, you cut out there, he also helped put together what?

1372
01:24:34,660 --> 01:24:38,140
He did the choreography for Tenchu, Step Assassins.

1373
01:24:38,140 --> 01:24:39,140
Awesome.

1374
01:24:39,140 --> 01:24:43,660
Yeah, I just posted a link about that, so...

1375
01:24:43,660 --> 01:24:46,800
This guy plays on everything, so you know what?

1376
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:51,420
They got the perfect person to play on Ryu, that's all.

1377
01:24:51,420 --> 01:24:52,660
That sounds awesome to me.

1378
01:24:52,660 --> 01:24:56,820
I'm looking forward to the Dead or Alive movie, even though I'm not a huge fan of the games,

1379
01:24:56,820 --> 01:25:00,780
I just I I'm really hoping they don't screw one of those movies up

1380
01:25:01,420 --> 01:25:07,900
Same here last I heard about the movie which was back in 2000 2001 William Shatner was supposed to be a part of it

1381
01:25:07,900 --> 01:25:10,600
Heck no, heck. No, I'm glad that didn't happen

1382
01:25:11,340 --> 01:25:13,340
You ain't the only one

1383
01:25:13,340 --> 01:25:15,460
Right on what else is on your mind Rama? Oh

1384
01:25:15,980 --> 01:25:23,380
Not much. I just went to a convention couple weeks back. You know, we have fun got drunk orgy, you know the normal chaos hot

1385
01:25:23,380 --> 01:25:24,380
I'm not.

1386
01:25:24,380 --> 01:25:32,020
We have Matt's parents listening. Please don't say those types of things on air. That's not

1387
01:25:32,020 --> 01:25:33,020
good.

1388
01:25:33,020 --> 01:25:34,020
Like orgy?

1389
01:25:34,020 --> 01:25:35,620
Yeah, don't say that word. That's a dirty word.

1390
01:25:35,620 --> 01:25:37,540
So I can't say orgy anymore?

1391
01:25:37,540 --> 01:25:39,100
No, you can't. It's banned tonight.

1392
01:25:39,100 --> 01:25:41,940
So orgy's a banned word?

1393
01:25:41,940 --> 01:25:45,460
I don't know if Loki's going to come back on air. I think he's too embarrassed. I think...

1394
01:25:45,460 --> 01:25:46,460
Oh, here he comes.

1395
01:25:46,460 --> 01:25:47,460
And I'm John.

1396
01:25:47,460 --> 01:25:48,460
Yes.

1397
01:25:48,460 --> 01:25:49,460
They are actually listening.

1398
01:25:49,460 --> 01:25:50,740
Oh, my purse is ringing.

1399
01:25:50,740 --> 01:25:54,180
yes yes i think that they wanted to know where you went

1400
01:25:54,180 --> 01:25:55,820
uh...

1401
01:25:55,820 --> 01:26:00,380
you know they are actually listening to the show

1402
01:26:00,380 --> 01:26:01,860
probably

1403
01:26:01,860 --> 01:26:05,860
that i have not been done the federal family laughing out of it

1404
01:26:05,860 --> 01:26:08,700
just think of this

1405
01:26:08,700 --> 01:26:10,340
because this is a

1406
01:26:10,340 --> 01:26:14,020
uh... a right of passage this is something that every young man must go

1407
01:26:14,020 --> 01:26:16,180
through

1408
01:26:16,180 --> 01:26:20,940
when your mom finds out that you're a drunk on the internet

1409
01:26:20,940 --> 01:26:23,540
i want a copy of this show

1410
01:26:23,540 --> 01:26:25,640
we'll figure something out

1411
01:26:25,640 --> 01:26:28,340
please do

1412
01:26:28,340 --> 01:26:31,860
alright rama anything else on your mind cause we gotta go and make fun of loki

1413
01:26:31,860 --> 01:26:32,940
what?

1414
01:26:32,940 --> 01:26:35,800
have a couple of drinks for me okay at least

1415
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:40,140
have one for me i'm on number nine and i've gotta go to the potty so bad

1416
01:26:40,140 --> 01:26:42,120
it's not even fun give us a drink count

1417
01:26:42,120 --> 01:26:46,840
I'm on 9, Loki's on, he's got a full glass on. Is that 7 and 8?

1418
01:26:46,840 --> 01:26:48,920
I think that's like 9 and 10.

1419
01:26:48,920 --> 01:26:55,140
He's got another double shot, whatever that is, and DarkSakura, what drink number are you on, for those keeping count at home?

1420
01:26:55,140 --> 01:26:57,600
Six. She's putting up six fingers.

1421
01:26:57,600 --> 01:27:00,880
I can't believe that my family is listening to this, this is crazy.

1422
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:05,840
Well, the six is counting actual number of drinks,

1423
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:07,360
not counting shots.

1424
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:11,520
Why are people listening to me? I mean, that's so crazy.

1425
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:15,640
Rama, we gotta go. Because you are fucking hilarious. I know I am.

1426
01:27:15,640 --> 01:27:17,840
Bye-bye.

1427
01:27:17,840 --> 01:27:22,800
No, no, Ron-chan can't go. I already hung up on him, I'm sorry. Ron-chan has to come back.

1428
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:25,680
Well, what do you want to tell him? He's listening.

1429
01:27:25,680 --> 01:27:26,800
Nothing.

1430
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:31,240
Alright, so about those, you know, dancing games.

1431
01:27:31,240 --> 01:27:35,400
Ah, who fucking plays those anymore?

1432
01:27:35,400 --> 01:27:38,400
I can't believe my grandparents are listening to this crazy...

1433
01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:42,400
I'm sorry, I'm sorry to, for Matt's grandparents, I'm normally much left without help.

1434
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:48,400
I know, we are all, I have to go over to their, to my mom's house tomorrow to actually, like, you know, do Fourth of July stuff.

1435
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:49,400
We're outstanding.

1436
01:27:49,400 --> 01:27:54,400
We're actually outstanding citizens of the community, and we do charity work and all that, don't we?

1437
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:55,400
No.

1438
01:27:55,400 --> 01:27:56,400
I did charity work.

1439
01:27:56,400 --> 01:27:57,400
Okay, you can turn the speaker down now.

1440
01:27:57,400 --> 01:27:58,400
Okay, sorry.

1441
01:27:58,400 --> 01:28:04,400
All I gotta say right now is, for some reason, my hand is numb and I don't know why that is, my lips are numb.

1442
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:10,400
And I have a full drink here, so I've got to finish that, and I don't know.

1443
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:13,400
I mixed Loki a super yummy drink.

1444
01:28:13,400 --> 01:28:16,400
Thank God I have a designated driver.

1445
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:20,400
Yes, again boys and girls, if you are going to drink, have a designated driver.

1446
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:22,400
We were model citizens and we planned designated drivers.

1447
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:25,400
No, no, no, no, you were wrong, Chet. You were wrong, DT.

1448
01:28:25,400 --> 01:28:28,400
Because I have had six actual drinks.

1449
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:31,400
I've had one, two beers.

1450
01:28:31,400 --> 01:28:39,400
I have had 10 shots, including my beers.

1451
01:28:39,400 --> 01:28:42,400
That's great. I get to go face my family tomorrow.

1452
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:43,400
That's awesome.

1453
01:28:43,400 --> 01:28:48,400
So fix it! Fix it now!

1454
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:52,400
What did you put in here? Did you just put two shots? Because it tastes sort of like...

1455
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:59,400
I mixed two oranges. I mixed a half shot of the pineapple rum and two shots of vodka.

1456
01:28:59,400 --> 01:29:03,800
tastes like the pineapple in there. I was trying to make you a more tropical drink.

1457
01:29:03,800 --> 01:29:09,240
Okay whatever. I want to try a sip of it though. Give me. Alright here you go. Oh man. Now

1458
01:29:09,240 --> 01:29:13,840
that you're not spilling it all over the damn kitchen. I'm not spilling anything okay. It's

1459
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:17,880
actually pretty good. You did too freaking spill it all over the damn kitchen. Yeah but.

1460
01:29:17,880 --> 01:29:23,320
Cause poor Exifer was down there with a towel on his hands and knees scrubbing up after

1461
01:29:23,320 --> 01:29:27,080
your freaking sloshy liquor ass.

1462
01:29:27,080 --> 01:29:30,440
Listen, I brought the towel with me, okay? I brought the paper towel with me.

1463
01:29:30,440 --> 01:29:34,120
You brought one with you. Okay, okay. No, no, no. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck that.

1464
01:29:34,120 --> 01:29:38,120
You had the towel with you in here.

1465
01:29:38,120 --> 01:29:41,640
You were spilling freakin' orange juice all over the goddamn floor. And if

1466
01:29:41,640 --> 01:29:44,800
orange juice left unchecked, tends to mutate

1467
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:48,520
and collect dust bunnies, which turn into a huge fucking mess.

1468
01:29:48,520 --> 01:29:52,600
Okie dokie. So you, sir,

1469
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:58,600
Spilled the orange juice on the floor, and it's not for the valiant-

1470
01:29:58,600 --> 01:29:59,600
Can we move on?

1471
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:01,600
No, no, no, no, I am not done.

1472
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:06,600
It's not for the valiant efforts of your roommate, Rob.

1473
01:30:06,600 --> 01:30:07,600
Extover?

1474
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:08,600
Yes.

1475
01:30:08,600 --> 01:30:13,600
There would be, you would be stepping in quagmire every time you entered the kitchen.

1476
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:17,600
Something along the lines of my ex apartment.

1477
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:18,600
Quagmire.

1478
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:20,600
Can we, can we please?

1479
01:30:20,600 --> 01:30:21,600
Hey, we should go...

1480
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:22,600
What?

1481
01:30:22,600 --> 01:30:23,600
Green Pong!

1482
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:28,640
Your sister says, uh, have fun, Orange Lounge, be safe, bye, your family, see you on the

1483
01:30:28,640 --> 01:30:29,640
4th.

1484
01:30:29,640 --> 01:30:33,920
Why are they listening to this show?

1485
01:30:33,920 --> 01:30:35,880
Shame on them!

1486
01:30:35,880 --> 01:30:38,120
So they have something to put in the Christmas card.

1487
01:30:38,120 --> 01:30:43,000
I guess, but I'm surprised that they were able to connect to this show.

1488
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:47,960
Look at it this way, Loki's family, out there, listening.

1489
01:30:47,960 --> 01:30:51,280
There are many, many worse things that Loki could be doing right now.

1490
01:30:51,280 --> 01:30:52,700
He doesn't do drugs.

1491
01:30:52,700 --> 01:30:54,960
He's a drug-free American citizen.

1492
01:30:54,960 --> 01:30:57,160
I only drink on week two weekends.

1493
01:30:57,160 --> 01:31:00,400
He provides a service to the youth of America.

1494
01:31:00,400 --> 01:31:02,480
He teaches them to stay in school.

1495
01:31:02,480 --> 01:31:03,480
Right.

1496
01:31:03,480 --> 01:31:07,520
You have to be the one to end up like me.

1497
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:08,920
Alright.

1498
01:31:08,920 --> 01:31:12,800
Um, I've really got to go to the bathroom.

1499
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:13,800
So we're going to go to a cage match.

1500
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:16,040
Okay, we're going to go to a cage match and then we'll come back and we'll take more

1501
01:31:16,040 --> 01:31:17,040
snacks.

1502
01:31:17,040 --> 01:31:20,920
last week's program and i'm going to have a lot of

1503
01:31:20,920 --> 01:31:24,580
i didn't win when we're getting one more call i think this is from a new

1504
01:31:24,580 --> 01:31:26,440
listeners so that i take this call

1505
01:31:26,440 --> 01:31:29,760
okay to me like it when new people call it so i think i picked it up

1506
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:34,040
higher on our front radio

1507
01:31:34,040 --> 01:31:37,520
all your very very quiet on their deep top where he is there any way to talk to

1508
01:31:37,520 --> 01:31:39,080
your microphone or

1509
01:31:39,080 --> 01:31:40,120
uh... called on

1510
01:31:40,120 --> 01:31:41,200
okay

1511
01:31:41,200 --> 01:31:45,480
what should i hold on a little bit talk again

1512
01:31:45,480 --> 01:31:46,400
hold on a second

1513
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:49,960
okay he's very very quiet boys and girls we're sorry

1514
01:31:49,960 --> 01:31:54,080
it's always the quiet ones we can watch out for we could barely hear you my

1515
01:31:54,080 --> 01:31:57,580
friend

1516
01:31:57,580 --> 01:31:58,920
hello

1517
01:31:58,920 --> 01:32:00,920
i think he might have turned off the

1518
01:32:00,920 --> 01:32:04,960
no just give him a moment to adjust

1519
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:08,240
see i can hear you just as loud as i can hear him

1520
01:32:08,240 --> 01:32:13,240
Oh, that's right. We'll give you a tip in the chatroom, and then why don't you call us back after the cage match, alright?

1521
01:32:13,240 --> 01:32:14,240
Alright, thanks.

1522
01:32:14,240 --> 01:32:15,240
Alright, later.

1523
01:32:15,240 --> 01:32:16,240
Later.

1524
01:32:16,240 --> 01:32:19,240
I can hear myself on there. That's kind of weird. He's very quiet.

1525
01:32:19,240 --> 01:32:20,240
He's got a very low dela-

1526
01:32:20,240 --> 01:32:21,240
Microphone again!

1527
01:32:21,240 --> 01:32:22,240
Sorry, I'm trying to get down.

1528
01:32:22,240 --> 01:32:23,240
You gave me a freakin' headache.

1529
01:32:23,240 --> 01:32:24,240
Wow.

1530
01:32:24,240 --> 01:32:26,240
He's got a very small delay, though.

1531
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:27,240
Yeah, he must have a fast-

1532
01:32:27,240 --> 01:32:29,240
He has to be near to us.

1533
01:32:29,240 --> 01:32:31,240
He must have a fast internet connection, so.

1534
01:32:31,240 --> 01:32:35,240
Everything's spinning. That's...fun.

1535
01:32:35,240 --> 01:32:40,240
You know what, you're fucked up, and I'm like not even half there, so whatever.

1536
01:32:40,240 --> 01:32:42,240
Nah, it's okay. I still have to finish my drink.

1537
01:32:42,240 --> 01:32:47,240
Because I need to save room in my liquor tolerance for the club tonight, so I can get my hoe on.

1538
01:32:47,240 --> 01:32:54,240
I think this is the most drunkness I've been, you know, because honestly when I was at my San Diego-

1539
01:32:54,240 --> 01:32:56,240
I'm already sobering up, so it doesn't even matter.

1540
01:32:56,240 --> 01:33:00,240
Well, at my San Diego event, you know, I thought I was pretty drunk, but this is pretty bad,

1541
01:33:00,240 --> 01:33:04,080
pretty bad cuz I mean like I actually feel like I'm gonna like fall over and

1542
01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:08,480
just pass out or something but you know I'm we really need to go to a cage match

1543
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:15,040
kids cuz I've got to pee right here in the studio I brought my zip drive here

1544
01:33:15,040 --> 01:33:19,320
we go let's talk nice get it doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo

1545
01:33:19,320 --> 01:33:27,680
there it is the way the way the case three songs we're gonna play through

1546
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:35,560
You get to vote for your favorite, and the winning song goes into rotation all week long

1547
01:33:35,560 --> 01:33:39,320
on Orange Lounge Radio Live, the Londie Music and War Program, which plays 24 hours a day,

1548
01:33:39,320 --> 01:33:40,320
7 days a week.

1549
01:33:40,320 --> 01:33:43,800
So basically, we're going to play three songs to vote for your favorite, that's how it works.

1550
01:33:43,800 --> 01:33:47,320
It's totally you guys, you guys get control, and I know we have new listeners tonight.

1551
01:33:47,320 --> 01:33:49,200
Only votes for Loki count.

1552
01:33:49,200 --> 01:33:51,520
No, don't tell them that.

1553
01:33:51,520 --> 01:33:56,360
Alright, so you only get to hear a clip of the song that won from last week because you

1554
01:33:56,360 --> 01:33:58,880
already heard it last week even though I know we have new listeners tonight

1555
01:33:58,880 --> 01:34:05,660
thanks to the great Apple we're only playing a clip and I'm so God look you

1556
01:34:05,660 --> 01:34:10,920
are so freaky drunk right now it's not even funny I'm no no no no no he's not I

1557
01:34:10,920 --> 01:34:15,800
have to make him the mother of all dreams remember you cannot vote until

1558
01:34:15,800 --> 01:34:19,640
all three songs to play in their entire Christopher's death because it's

1559
01:34:19,640 --> 01:34:23,280
probably getting messed up from me but here we go keep it clean song number one

1560
01:34:23,280 --> 01:34:27,080
It's last week's winner dark or two weeks ago really because we didn't have a show

1561
01:34:27,680 --> 01:34:31,800
Dark Sakura picked tell the funky homo sapien with dr. Bombay

1562
01:34:31,800 --> 01:34:36,320
It's cuz this one's fucking awesome. So see if you like it. Here's a clip song number one

1563
01:34:36,320 --> 01:34:43,320
one you can vote for tonight, Del the funky homo sapien, Dr. Bombay.

1564
01:35:06,320 --> 01:35:11,320
Just turn on me, you don't stop me, you don't play

1565
01:35:11,320 --> 01:35:14,320
Every time I try to get to me, it's always running away

1566
01:35:16,320 --> 01:35:20,320
Just turn on me, don't you buy diamonds, don't you stay

1567
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:23,320
I'm just once guaranteed to make my day

1568
01:35:25,320 --> 01:35:27,320
Large as a black woman's duty it's back

1569
01:35:27,320 --> 01:35:30,320
And the question everybody is asking is

1570
01:35:32,320 --> 01:35:34,320
A brother named George, it's a 150 month old

1571
01:35:34,320 --> 01:35:36,320
So let's take it to the stage, you suckers

1572
01:35:36,320 --> 01:35:39,320
I jam, and Mr. Darlene is too much

1573
01:35:39,320 --> 01:35:42,320
Back in the house looking too holly whimsy

1574
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:44,320
Now you know everything is terrific

1575
01:35:44,320 --> 01:35:47,320
Punk in the 1990s, that's ironic

1576
01:35:47,320 --> 01:35:49,320
So grab you a sack of that chronic

1577
01:35:49,320 --> 01:35:51,320
Down with the links, mind straight from the ghetto

1578
01:35:51,320 --> 01:35:53,320
But I'm under the sun in the meadow

1579
01:35:53,320 --> 01:35:55,320
Me and this Amazon sittin' on my lap

1580
01:35:55,320 --> 01:35:58,320
She bust so big when she walk in clackin'

1581
01:35:58,320 --> 01:36:00,320
Doin' the hoochie coochie and the four shawls

1582
01:36:00,320 --> 01:36:02,320
Know who I am, so girl sing the chorus

1583
01:36:32,320 --> 01:36:44,320
Watch and watch, cause if your spouse calls, your sales gonna jam so it'll make your house

1584
01:36:44,320 --> 01:36:45,320
call.

1585
01:36:45,320 --> 01:36:49,320
Your peeps on my jaws, on your mitts I'm a dog, so you might peep off.

1586
01:36:49,320 --> 01:36:55,320
Wait, it ain't foolin' jock, cause you're real far from a ballerina, so.

1587
01:36:55,320 --> 01:36:59,320
Mr. Diamantina, freeze, and get up off your knees.

1588
01:36:59,320 --> 01:37:11,320
I like clubmen hangin' out with the men, and girl, if you ain't got a germ, I won't hesitate

1589
01:37:11,320 --> 01:37:13,320
to pull out my funky rhymes.

1590
01:37:13,320 --> 01:37:17,320
But if you ain't down for jump on, cancel your appointment and please get the hell on,

1591
01:37:17,320 --> 01:37:20,320
cause I won't have one lit rose under my nose.

1592
01:37:20,320 --> 01:37:25,320
If you want eighty pieces of clothes, get out my way so I can save the day, cause I'm

1593
01:37:25,320 --> 01:37:55,300
Cause I'm Dr. Rob

1594
01:37:55,300 --> 01:38:24,300
I don't even know if I flushed, I was so drunk, no I did, I did kiss, I'm sanitary.

1595
01:38:24,300 --> 01:38:28,300
Alright, um, so it's Delta Funky Homosapien with Dr. Bombay.

1596
01:38:28,300 --> 01:38:30,300
Uh, so see if you like that one.

1597
01:38:30,300 --> 01:38:33,300
Here's song number two. Song number two tonight is my pick.

1598
01:38:33,300 --> 01:38:36,300
And you might remember last week we announced, or no, two weeks ago,

1599
01:38:36,300 --> 01:38:38,300
maybe it was three, I don't even know at this point,

1600
01:38:38,300 --> 01:38:40,300
we announced a brand new song for DDR UltraMix 3.

1601
01:38:40,300 --> 01:38:42,300
I'm sorry, we played a new song.

1602
01:38:42,300 --> 01:38:44,300
It was previously announced on, on DDR Freak Forum.

1603
01:38:44,300 --> 01:38:46,300
So we played it for the first time.

1604
01:38:46,300 --> 01:38:48,300
It was a band called The Azoic.

1605
01:38:48,300 --> 01:38:50,300
And I've been a fan of The Azoic for several months now,

1606
01:38:50,300 --> 01:38:52,300
before they were ever announced for UltraMix 3. What?

1607
01:38:52,300 --> 01:38:57,900
your eyes are wide you look like freaking frodo it's awesome um so i i wanted to play another

1608
01:39:04,700 --> 01:39:09,180
all right um so i wanted to play an azoic song for you guys because it's kind of gothic i like it i

1609
01:39:09,180 --> 01:39:13,020

1610
01:39:13,020 --> 01:39:19,420
gotta find something to wear though so anyway here it is i shall wear this all right here we go

1611
01:39:19,420 --> 01:39:45,340
You tried to get to me, crawled inside of me, but now I'm purging out the pain to stay

1612
01:39:45,340 --> 01:39:46,340
free.

1613
01:39:46,340 --> 01:39:49,340
Purging out the pain to stay free

1614
01:39:49,340 --> 01:39:51,340
Don't you believe they died?

1615
01:39:51,340 --> 01:39:52,340
Sweet sanctity taking

1616
01:39:52,340 --> 01:39:55,340
What's left of me, how condescending

1617
01:40:25,340 --> 01:40:43,340
I thought you should know that I, except I throw it in, now I'm leaving, don't you know?

1618
01:40:43,340 --> 01:40:50,340
I'm, I'm losing you and I, I feel free and you, can't take my strength away, no way

1619
01:40:50,340 --> 01:40:53,680
And then the city's gonna be full inside of me

1620
01:40:53,680 --> 01:40:56,840
But now I'm cruising in the thing you say

1621
01:40:56,840 --> 01:40:59,540
And the truth is, from this day to day night

1622
01:40:59,540 --> 01:41:01,340
Sweet things that you've been thinking

1623
01:41:01,340 --> 01:41:04,140
Are left to me condescending

1624
01:41:04,140 --> 01:41:08,840
Do you think you can get to me?

1625
01:41:08,840 --> 01:41:12,340
Let me tell you something

1626
01:41:12,340 --> 01:41:17,840
I won't be pushed around, no

1627
01:41:17,840 --> 01:41:31,840
If my life aren't fair enough to give up that easy, you better not break me down

1628
01:42:47,840 --> 01:42:51,080
You're here for the future and there's no holding back

1629
01:42:51,080 --> 01:42:54,480
My hopes and dreams are set for perfect light

1630
01:42:54,480 --> 01:42:57,840
I miss you from your birth, they're very sweet for you

1631
01:42:57,840 --> 01:43:01,280
But you know that I've been my source of time

1632
01:43:01,280 --> 01:43:04,720
You'll take this very home and you will feel it all

1633
01:43:04,720 --> 01:43:07,600
How you bring all the strength within me

1634
01:43:07,600 --> 01:43:12,320
So you think you can get to me

1635
01:43:12,320 --> 01:43:15,840
Then let me tell you something

1636
01:43:15,840 --> 01:43:21,340
And I won't be pushed around, no

1637
01:43:22,840 --> 01:43:25,840
If my life are fair enough

1638
01:43:26,340 --> 01:43:29,340
To give up that easy

1639
01:43:29,840 --> 01:43:34,840
Can I break me down?

1640
01:43:35,840 --> 01:43:37,840
Take my feet

1641
01:44:07,840 --> 01:44:19,840
Song number two, the Azoic. Let me tell you something. And let me tell you, I don't know if these two heard much of that song, but they'll give it a rating anyway. Dark Sakura.

1642
01:44:19,840 --> 01:44:23,840
It's the same fucking stuff you always pick.

1643
01:44:23,840 --> 01:44:26,840
I don't, I think you're wrong. I think it's different.

1644
01:44:26,840 --> 01:44:32,840
Cindy Boyce, Cindy Boyce, and Tramp. Over generic beats, Tramp.

1645
01:44:32,840 --> 01:44:35,840
I think if you put that side by side with my previous picks, the song's very different.

1646
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:38,200
especially okay and i give it a seven

1647
01:44:38,200 --> 01:44:39,120
loki

1648
01:44:39,120 --> 01:44:40,640
she's wanted to make fun of me

1649
01:44:40,640 --> 01:44:42,240
i'll give it a

1650
01:44:42,240 --> 01:44:44,680
nine because

1651
01:44:44,680 --> 01:44:49,600
i wasn't here to listen to it but it sounds great

1652
01:44:49,600 --> 01:44:51,800
this is the drunkest i've ever seen loki

1653
01:44:51,800 --> 01:44:52,880
i'm gonna make him drunk

1654
01:44:52,880 --> 01:44:55,280
i could have played britney spears and i would have got a nine

1655
01:44:55,280 --> 01:44:57,560
i didn't even know what the hell you played

1656
01:44:57,560 --> 01:44:59,640
it's gonna get a nine though

1657
01:44:59,640 --> 01:45:01,040
it's the azoic let me tell you something

1658
01:45:01,040 --> 01:45:04,120
azoic is good i was listening to the different drum stuff

1659
01:45:04,120 --> 01:45:06,840
earlier today when I was trying to find something to play

1660
01:45:06,840 --> 01:45:07,880
but um...

1661
01:45:07,880 --> 01:45:09,040
Azoic is good

1662
01:45:09,040 --> 01:45:11,900
so I'll give you a nine, cause Azoic rocks

1663
01:45:11,900 --> 01:45:14,400
and I give that song a leaveny billion

1664
01:45:14,400 --> 01:45:15,600
because the song is awesome

1665
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:18,200
I second that, a leaveny billion is good

1666
01:45:18,200 --> 01:45:20,160
a leaveny billion for the Azoic

1667
01:45:20,160 --> 01:45:21,320
a leaveny billion

1668
01:45:21,320 --> 01:45:25,880
honestly, Azoic needs more stuff, there's actually, there's another group that I need

1669
01:45:25,880 --> 01:45:28,520
um... music from, but they only had

1670
01:45:28,520 --> 01:45:34,100
one million samplers on their site and it begins with an E, but I can't remember the goddamn name of the...

1671
01:45:34,100 --> 01:45:36,500
stupid band

1672
01:45:36,500 --> 01:45:37,540
emo

1673
01:45:37,540 --> 01:45:41,100
no it's not emo it's uh...

1674
01:45:41,100 --> 01:45:42,500
something else who cares

1675
01:45:42,500 --> 01:45:46,060
song number three your pick what'd you pick for us loki

1676
01:45:46,060 --> 01:45:48,660
something from every little thing

1677
01:45:48,660 --> 01:45:51,580
is from elt trance

1678
01:45:51,580 --> 01:45:55,780
i can't remember what they got here it's called feel my heart the moog wye remix

1679
01:45:55,780 --> 01:46:01,540
yeah feel my heart moog wye remix and it was just kind of cool sounding from what i had

1680
01:46:01,540 --> 01:46:08,540
I had another ELT trance song that was kind of rock sounding but it wasn't good enough

1681
01:46:08,540 --> 01:46:15,060
so I picked this one and honestly right now I am in no condition to say how good the song

1682
01:46:15,060 --> 01:46:21,580
was but I think it was pretty good so take a listen and enjoy.

1683
01:46:21,580 --> 01:46:28,580
I might throw up, this isn't good. Alright here we go, song number three every little thing.

1684
01:48:21,580 --> 01:48:23,580
Oh

1685
01:49:51,580 --> 01:49:53,580
You

1686
01:50:21,580 --> 01:50:31,580
Song number 3 in tonight's cage match, Every Little Thing, Feel My Heart, the Mugwai remix.

1687
01:50:31,580 --> 01:50:37,580
Let's see what our people in the room thought about Every Little Thing, Feel My Heart.

1688
01:50:37,580 --> 01:50:39,580
Dark Sakura, Every Little Thing.

1689
01:50:39,580 --> 01:50:40,580
Two.

1690
01:50:40,580 --> 01:50:41,580
Why is that?

1691
01:50:41,580 --> 01:50:43,580
Because it sucks.

1692
01:50:43,580 --> 01:50:44,580
Alright.

1693
01:50:44,580 --> 01:50:45,580
Tuka's it sucks.

1694
01:50:45,580 --> 01:50:46,580
Loki.

1695
01:50:46,580 --> 01:50:57,580
I give it a, um, I don't know, a five? I don't really know because I wasn't listening to it because I was drunk.

1696
01:50:58,580 --> 01:51:06,580
Um, the parts I heard sound neat, but you guys are giving it really low scores. I would have given it a low score.

1697
01:51:06,580 --> 01:51:07,580
It was a pretty good song.

1698
01:51:07,580 --> 01:51:08,580
You know, I'll add it together.

1699
01:51:08,580 --> 01:51:14,580
I liked it when I originally picked it out when I was sober, and it was good, okay? That was pretty good.

1700
01:51:14,580 --> 01:51:19,580
The original song I had picked out wasn't quite as good, so I'll give it an 8.

1701
01:51:19,580 --> 01:51:29,080
But, um, right now, you could play it like, you know, a cat in heat, you know, a sound effect of that, and I would probably give it a 10.

1702
01:51:29,080 --> 01:51:29,580
Right.

1703
01:51:29,580 --> 01:51:31,080
Cause I'm just so gone.

1704
01:51:31,080 --> 01:51:36,080
Well, I'll combine 2 plus 5 and give it a 7, cause I kinda don't like this. It's okay.

1705
01:51:36,080 --> 01:51:39,580
Alright, let's listen to three songs you can vote for tonight.

1706
01:51:39,580 --> 01:51:42,580
Uh, here it is. Song number one you can vote for tonight.

1707
01:51:42,580 --> 01:51:44,260
Del the Funky Homosapien.

1708
01:51:44,260 --> 01:51:45,940
We played three songs already?

1709
01:51:45,940 --> 01:51:47,060
Yeah, it's already done.

1710
01:51:47,060 --> 01:51:49,220
Del the Funky Homosapien, Dr. Bombay.

1711
01:51:57,220 --> 01:51:58,980
Every time I hear that song, I can't help but think,

1712
01:51:58,980 --> 01:52:01,540
check and turn, and send it to the ladder.

1713
01:52:01,540 --> 01:52:03,300
Here it is, song number two tonight.

1714
01:52:03,300 --> 01:52:10,300
Ezoic, let me tell you something.

1715
01:52:13,140 --> 01:52:16,700
And song number three you can vote for tonight, Every Little Thing,

1716
01:52:16,700 --> 01:52:23,220
Feel My Heart, the Moog Wire remix.

1717
01:52:23,220 --> 01:52:27,460
I hope they're not gonna get me out of here tonight.

1718
01:52:27,460 --> 01:52:33,060
Place vote now. Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote

1719
01:52:33,060 --> 01:52:36,060
And we'll tally them up, and hopefully I can keep count tonight.

1720
01:52:36,060 --> 01:52:44,060
Um, we'll tally them up. Please don't post a vote publicly, because I don't see those as easily, and then I don't, I don't, um, tabulate it.

1721
01:52:44,060 --> 01:52:47,060
And that's no fun at all, when I can't tabulate your vote.

1722
01:52:47,060 --> 01:52:50,060
So, how's it going there, Sky?

1723
01:52:50,060 --> 01:52:54,060
I'm, I'm feeling okay, I'm just, I'm a little...

1724
01:52:54,060 --> 01:53:02,060
I have no sense of balance right now, and I'm pretty drunk, I think.

1725
01:53:02,060 --> 01:53:09,400
Yeah, me too. I'm I'm pretty out of it. I I can't focus on you right now man cuz you're all over the place

1726
01:53:11,900 --> 01:53:13,140
And

1727
01:53:13,140 --> 01:53:18,600
Yeah, I think my family stopped listening. So that's good. It's probably a good that's probably a good thing

1728
01:53:18,600 --> 01:53:21,620
And I'm sure I'll get much crap for it tomorrow

1729
01:53:21,780 --> 01:53:28,540
But you know what? I don't care because I'm having a barbecue and it's free food and you know what?

1730
01:53:29,180 --> 01:53:31,180
That's all good. Oh

1731
01:53:31,180 --> 01:53:36,180
Oh, I am so dizzy right now.

1732
01:53:36,180 --> 01:53:39,180
I know, I honestly am at the point where I'm like, what do I do with the rest of the show?

1733
01:53:39,180 --> 01:53:44,180
Like, I could literally run into the wall and I wouldn't feel it because I'm so numb right now.

1734
01:53:44,180 --> 01:53:47,180
I was hugging the corner earlier, I don't know why, it just felt very comfortable.

1735
01:53:47,180 --> 01:53:51,180
My head rested very well in the corner, it was very interesting.

1736
01:53:51,180 --> 01:53:53,180
Yeah, I saw that, I saw that.

1737
01:53:53,180 --> 01:53:57,180
And people were saying, you know what, you're so drunk.

1738
01:53:57,180 --> 01:54:09,180
Honestly, folks, I am pretty drunk, but I am still pretty coherent. I just have no sense of balance whatsoever right now in most of my...

1739
01:54:09,180 --> 01:54:13,180
Well, we're getting feedback, but we're going to try and take this call. Hi, you're on Orange House Radio.

1740
01:54:13,180 --> 01:54:16,180
Sorry about that. Sorry about that. Can you hear me now?

1741
01:54:16,180 --> 01:54:17,180
Yes.

1742
01:54:17,180 --> 01:54:20,180
It's DeepFell42. Sorry about that earlier.

1743
01:54:20,180 --> 01:54:25,180
That's all right. What's on your mind? We're hearing a bad echo, so I'm just going to give you a minute to put out your thoughts.

1744
01:54:25,180 --> 01:54:31,180
That was because I forgot to turn my iTunes volume down, so that was the main reason of that.

1745
01:54:31,180 --> 01:54:33,180
What's on your mind?

1746
01:54:33,180 --> 01:54:42,180
No, I just wanted to let you guys know that if you go to KevinPereira.com, I wanted to let you know how to vote for you guys for Attack of the Show.

1747
01:54:42,180 --> 01:54:43,180

01:56:53,900 --> 01:56:57,700
Oh my god, if we picked us drunk on TV that would be great.

1790
01:56:57,700 --> 01:56:59,600

jamie looked good in her skirt didn't she? where did she go?

1811
01:57:55,780 --> 01:58:00,780
She went to the bathroom, because she doesn't think she looks good, but she does.

1812
01:58:00,780 --> 01:58:02,780
Why? She looks incredible!

1813
01:58:02,780 --> 01:58:03,780
She does. She looks fine.

1814
01:58:03,780 --> 01:58:07,780
I'm sorry, I'm just like drunk, so I think everyone looks hot.

1815
01:58:07,780 --> 01:58:09,780

1816
01:58:09,780 --> 01:58:13,780
Jamie! Jamie! Where'd you go?

1817
01:58:13,780 --> 01:58:15,780
I think she's yelling at us, so we better go to break.

1818
01:58:15,780 --> 01:58:16,780
I think I need a drink.

1819
01:58:16,780 --> 01:58:18,780
No, you better not have any more drinks. Alright.

1820
01:58:18,780 --> 01:58:22,780
Why? Don't call me back.

1821
01:58:22,780 --> 01:58:23,780
Break time.

01:58:23,780 --> 01:58:27,780

1823
01:58:27,780 --> 01:58:32,280
So hurry up, last call for Caged Mesh votes. Thank god there's no Carioc Revolution now.

1824
01:58:32,280 --> 01:58:36,280
I don't want to sing. Starting off with Stop Spinning Me in Circles. We'll be back.

1825
01:58:36,280 --> 01:58:38,280
I AM SPINNING MYSELF

1826
01:59:06,280 --> 01:59:13,280
You're playing roulette with my heart Stop spinning me in circles

1827
01:59:13,280 --> 01:59:21,280
Don't break my heart even though I could never live without you

1828
01:59:21,280 --> 01:59:45,280
I'm spinning me in circles You're playing moonlight with my heart

1829
01:59:45,280 --> 01:59:52,280
Stop spinning me in circles, don't make my heart you know I could never live without you

1830
01:59:52,280 --> 01:59:57,280
Stop spinning me in circles, don't stay and move them with my heart

1831
01:59:57,280 --> 02:00:00,280
I said, like, stop shooting me in circles

1832
02:00:00,280 --> 02:00:07,280
Don't make my heart beat, you know I just want to be with you

1833
02:00:30,280 --> 02:00:35,280
Arigatte no oku omoide tsui

1834
02:00:36,280 --> 02:00:41,280
Yureru egawa no wagukana tsuki

1835
02:00:41,280 --> 02:00:46,280
Shikakuri isakara

1836
02:00:46,280 --> 02:00:51,280
Turere no aa

1837
02:01:51,280 --> 02:02:14,280
I got my car all set to scramble I don't really know where I'm gonna go

1838
02:02:14,280 --> 02:02:20,280
Put down on pedal I got pedal to the metal

1839
02:02:20,280 --> 02:02:24,280
Roll down the highway just like a fire ball

1840
02:02:24,280 --> 02:02:28,280
Time rockin' steel, don't stop the fire wall burnin' out of control

1841
02:02:28,280 --> 02:02:33,280
Get those nanos on the sidewalk with the sky like rock and roll

1842
02:02:35,280 --> 02:02:37,280
Get hot

1843
02:02:37,280 --> 02:03:00,280
Kick it in my dress with your nuclear fishes made of a rose

1844
02:03:00,280 --> 02:03:04,280
I need a guy to feed a fly ball for an hour to go

1845
02:03:04,280 --> 02:03:08,280
My head is still feeling very wet, but daddy's getting on a roll

1846
02:03:08,280 --> 02:03:12,280
Feet in the air, just feeling smart, I'll bring you out as we go

1847
02:03:13,280 --> 02:03:15,280
I'm gonna getcha!

1848
02:03:21,280 --> 02:03:23,280
It's great man!

1849
02:03:30,280 --> 02:03:33,280
Don't you know, don't you know, I've been waiting for you

1850
02:03:33,280 --> 02:03:37,280
Don't you know, baby, you should show them right on time

1851
02:03:37,280 --> 02:03:40,280
Can't you see, can't you see, I've been waiting for you

1852
02:03:40,280 --> 02:03:46,280
Can't you see, baby, you should smile and write all the time

1853
02:03:52,280 --> 02:03:55,280
And I was younger, I wasn't free

1854
02:03:55,280 --> 02:03:58,280
All I wanted was attention

1855
02:03:58,280 --> 02:04:02,280
Party after party, beauty and money

1856
02:04:02,280 --> 02:04:05,280
We were so desperate for perfection

1857
02:04:05,280 --> 02:04:09,280
But you have made me feel so good

1858
02:04:09,280 --> 02:04:12,280
I've always been closer to you

1859
02:04:12,280 --> 02:04:16,280
I close my eyes in your arms

1860
02:04:16,280 --> 02:04:18,280
Life is simple again

1861
02:04:18,280 --> 02:04:21,280
With you, don't you know, don't you know

1862
02:04:21,280 --> 02:04:24,280
I've been waiting for you, don't you know

1863
02:04:24,280 --> 02:04:26,280
Baby, you're just gonna fly on by

1864
02:04:26,280 --> 02:04:28,280
Can't you see, can't you see

1865
02:04:28,280 --> 02:04:31,280
I've been waiting for you, can't you see

1866
02:04:31,280 --> 02:04:33,840
And baby you can smile and cry all the time

1867
02:04:33,840 --> 02:04:35,620
Don't you know, don't you know

1868
02:04:35,620 --> 02:04:37,300
I've been waiting for you

1869
02:04:37,300 --> 02:04:40,060
Don't you know baby you should show your pride

1870
02:04:40,060 --> 02:04:42,860
And time, can't you see, can't you see

1871
02:04:42,860 --> 02:04:44,220
I've been waiting for you

1872
02:04:44,220 --> 02:04:47,580
can't you see, baby you should smile and cry

1873
02:04:47,580 --> 02:04:50,240
All the time

1874
02:04:57,200 --> 02:05:00,460
Last week on Orange Lounge Radio

1875
02:05:00,460 --> 02:05:05,100
Next week on the show, we're going to have our very first special guest.

1876
02:05:05,100 --> 02:05:10,700
We're actually having over Melody and Mel B, and they're going to be our guests on the show,

1877
02:05:10,700 --> 02:05:13,820
and I get to clean house all week to be ready for them.

1878
02:05:14,940 --> 02:05:17,340
Oh God, I have to move everything out and deliver them,

1879
02:05:17,340 --> 02:05:20,060
because this room's crap as it is when we do the show here, so...

1880
02:05:20,060 --> 02:05:22,620
I have to say so, and they're quite trusty and moist.

1881
02:05:23,740 --> 02:05:25,500
Are you feeling a little moist tonight, Jamie?

1882
02:05:25,500 --> 02:05:33,000
Oh, every night on the show, as Irene makes his face.

1883
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:36,140
Orange Lounge Radio makes a moistest snack.

1884
02:05:36,140 --> 02:05:42,580
Join us every Sunday night from 7 p.m. until 9 p.m. Pacific Standard Time for the Orange

1885
02:05:42,580 --> 02:05:49,180
Lounge, with your hosts, Dark Sakura and Sky, where we'll talk about all things Bomani and

1886
02:05:49,180 --> 02:05:50,180
then some.

1887
02:05:50,180 --> 02:05:54,780
In the meantime, enjoy our Bomani Music and More program.

1888
02:05:54,780 --> 02:06:00,080
another flashback there an old episode I don't know it's like episode five or

1889
02:06:00,080 --> 02:06:04,380
something I don't know it's old it's hecka old we're back here on orange

1890
02:06:04,380 --> 02:06:11,160
lounge radio and been doing a little bit of drinking and I I'm cut off now and I

1891
02:06:11,160 --> 02:06:15,500
think Loki is is stuck with water now and dark Sakura I would love the chat

1892
02:06:15,500 --> 02:06:18,940
room forever if they tell me how to take those damn ink tags off my clothes

1893
02:06:18,940 --> 02:06:24,100
that's a bunch of crap I can hot topic fucked up I can never figure out how you

1894
02:06:24,100 --> 02:06:29,260
you were able to get out of Hot Topic with the tag on, because wouldn't it have beep-beep-beeped?

1895
02:06:29,260 --> 02:06:30,260
Should have, logically.

1896
02:06:30,260 --> 02:06:31,260
But you know what?

1897
02:06:31,260 --> 02:06:32,900
But now you know how to steal clothes.

1898
02:06:32,900 --> 02:06:36,660
And maybe you should, just to teach them a lesson.

1899
02:06:36,660 --> 02:06:37,660
No.

1900
02:06:37,660 --> 02:06:38,660
Alright.

1901
02:06:38,660 --> 02:06:39,660
Um.

1902
02:06:39,660 --> 02:06:40,660
Dark soccer.

1903
02:06:40,660 --> 02:06:41,660
This is magnetic.

1904
02:06:41,660 --> 02:06:44,820
Dark soccer is sounding a little angsty to me, so I think we need to get in the FUs of

1905
02:06:44,820 --> 02:06:45,820
the week.

1906
02:06:45,820 --> 02:06:49,300
However, I do want to announce tonight's cage match winner, but we didn't have a lot of

1907
02:06:49,300 --> 02:06:51,940
votes in tonight's cage match, which makes me a sad panda.

1908
02:06:51,940 --> 02:06:53,860
Doesn't that make you sad a little bit?

1909
02:06:53,860 --> 02:06:58,580
But we do have a winner nonetheless because even if there's one vote, one vote is enough

1910
02:06:58,580 --> 02:06:59,580
to declare the cage match.

1911
02:06:59,580 --> 02:07:03,820
So here is tonight's cage match wiener.

1912
02:07:03,820 --> 02:07:08,820
The wiener is the Azoic.

1913
02:07:08,820 --> 02:07:15,340
Let me tell you something, by one vote, one vote for the Azoic wins tonight's cage match.

1914
02:07:15,340 --> 02:07:17,460
Good job boys and girls.

1915
02:07:17,460 --> 02:07:21,340
All right.

1916
02:07:21,340 --> 02:07:26,340
Dark Soccer, I think you're wanting to get your angst on, aren't you?

1917
02:07:26,340 --> 02:07:27,340
Please.

1918
02:07:27,340 --> 02:07:28,340
Alright.

1919
02:07:28,340 --> 02:07:34,500
Hold on, I'm having a hard time locating the F.U. music right now.

1920
02:07:34,500 --> 02:07:35,500
You're still this song?

1921
02:07:35,500 --> 02:07:36,500
Yeah, you're this song.

1922
02:07:36,500 --> 02:07:37,500
Okay.

1923
02:07:37,500 --> 02:07:40,540
Dark Soccer, why is it we do the F.U.s every single week?

1924
02:07:40,540 --> 02:07:42,540
Because Hot Topic sucks.

1925
02:07:42,540 --> 02:07:59,540
So now I have to find something to wrap the ink tag in while I cut the wire, that's all.

1926
02:07:59,540 --> 02:08:01,540
That's it?

1927
02:08:01,540 --> 02:08:03,540
That's it.

1928
02:08:03,540 --> 02:08:05,540
Okay.

1929
02:08:05,540 --> 02:08:09,540
Hold on, I gotta find Loki's music here. Here it is!

1930
02:08:09,540 --> 02:08:11,540
Loki, your turn!

1931
02:08:11,540 --> 02:08:14,540
Chat room, you can send in your refuse right now if you want.

1932
02:08:14,540 --> 02:08:16,540
Loki, here you go, your turn.

1933
02:08:16,540 --> 02:08:22,540
The only thing I'm really mad about is how drunk I am,

1934
02:08:22,540 --> 02:08:25,540
because I felt like I was going to throw up something in the bathroom,

1935
02:08:25,540 --> 02:08:34,780
the bathroom but I didn't thank God I'm not that drunk yet so just F you to how

1936
02:08:34,780 --> 02:08:43,780

1937
02:08:43,780 --> 02:08:52,900
that's it all right continue with whoever else you can cut in the bathtub

1938
02:08:52,900 --> 02:09:01,860

1939
02:09:02,980 --> 02:09:09,700
i felt like i was gonna throw up earlier but i didn't so i was good you know angsty i'm very

1940
02:09:09,700 --> 02:09:15,700
I'm very drunk. I don't have the energy to be angsty. So, it's good.

1941
02:09:32,700 --> 02:09:38,700
I can't find my song. That's why I'm stalling. Are you sure you don't have anything else?

1942
02:09:38,700 --> 02:09:44,820
yeah I'm pretty sure the other thing I have is why the hell did my family

1943
02:09:44,820 --> 02:09:51,260
decide to listen to this show now when I'm drunk instead of like normally when

1944
02:09:51,260 --> 02:09:57,180
I'm doing a normal show I don't understand that kind of stuff but

1945
02:09:57,180 --> 02:10:03,500
whatever you know they know I'm drunk and I know they know I'm not only drunk

1946
02:10:03,500 --> 02:10:04,500
I am so...

1947
02:10:04,500 --> 02:10:10,260
I am way wasted right now.

1948
02:10:10,260 --> 02:10:15,860
I am so dizzy it's not even funny.

1949
02:10:15,860 --> 02:10:16,860
Monomena.

1950
02:10:16,860 --> 02:10:17,860
Monomena.

1951
02:10:17,860 --> 02:10:18,860
Any luck?

1952
02:10:18,860 --> 02:10:32,100
I can't even see you people because you're so damn drunk.

1953
02:10:32,100 --> 02:10:37,100
kostjamrh The chat room is noticing how slow your speech got all of a sudden. How many drinks did you have again?

1954
02:10:37,100 --> 02:10:42,100
p0k3smot42o I think it's empty

1955
02:10:47,100 --> 02:10:52,100
p0k3smot42o Oh my god, my turn

1956
02:10:52,100 --> 02:11:04,300
Um, I'm giving you an F.U. to the motherfucker who broke into my car for the second time

1957
02:11:04,300 --> 02:11:05,300
nonetheless.

1958
02:11:05,300 --> 02:11:09,380
Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me, I hate you.

1959
02:11:09,380 --> 02:11:10,720
Why did you have to do that to me?

1960
02:11:10,720 --> 02:11:16,460
I am a nice guy, a nice guy should not have the car broken into and just F.U. to the fact

1961
02:11:16,460 --> 02:11:19,860
I didn't have a car alarm but I shouldn't have to get an alarm because people should

1962
02:11:19,860 --> 02:11:24,660
the common fucking decency not to break into your shit. I hope you enjoy the stereo, I

1963
02:11:24,660 --> 02:11:29,140
hope it blows up on you, and I hope you get gonorrhea and die of SARS, because you're

1964
02:11:29,140 --> 02:11:33,740
just an asshole who steals things from people, who steal things that aren't yours. And now

1965
02:11:33,740 --> 02:11:37,020
I'm gonna have to rent a garage because of you, and that's $70 a month I'm out of the

1966
02:11:37,020 --> 02:11:41,620
money, because you can't keep your hands off my shit. Keep your hands off my shit, you

1967
02:11:41,620 --> 02:11:53,060
shit-eater and yeah an F you to that all right let's go to the chat room at use

1968
02:11:55,020 --> 02:12:00,380
dark knight says my F you is going to be for my job to have me work on the fourth

1969
02:12:00,380 --> 02:12:10,100
bitches dark knight says if it's a certain tag all you need to do is pinch

1970
02:12:10,100 --> 02:12:17,060
one of the tags so get like a pair of pliers okay the way that this one is

1971
02:12:17,060 --> 02:12:23,460
it's got the clear tag with the blue ink and the yellow ink you can see through

1972
02:12:23,460 --> 02:12:28,100
the tag the other side has a long part that's attached to a more cylindrical

1973
02:12:28,100 --> 02:12:33,900
looking part with a domed end you can see a thin wire connecting the two what

1974
02:12:33,900 --> 02:12:37,940
I am concerned about is that without having anything to wrap it in if I cut

1975
02:12:37,940 --> 02:12:41,920
the wire because it is magnetically charged at the point it senses the magnetic

1976
02:12:41,920 --> 02:12:48,920
destruction it will explode the ink. I have nothing to wrap it in. So yeah, find me a way around that.

1977
02:12:53,920 --> 02:12:56,920
Illusion says F you to Loki in his slurred speech.

02:13:26,080 --> 02:13:31,300
Iguana Girl says my F U is too emotion and I don't think this is the song either. I've

1982
02:13:31,300 --> 02:13:36,120

Dark Tetsuya says seconded on the F you to the bastards who broke into your car same thing happened to my mom some years ago

1987
02:14:04,380 --> 02:14:11,020

1988
02:14:11,020 --> 02:14:19,660
Vidpalette says, F you to homework over holiday weekends and F you to my DVD case being cracked

1989
02:14:19,660 --> 02:14:21,860
in the mail.

1990
02:14:21,860 --> 02:14:26,380
And DeepThought42 says, F you to the Hillary Clinton for saying that video games are to

1991
02:14:26,380 --> 02:14:28,780
blame for your kids' sociopathic behavior.

1992
02:14:28,780 --> 02:14:31,700
It's your fucking parents' fault!

1993
02:14:31,700 --> 02:14:33,700
Damn straight.

1994
02:14:33,700 --> 02:14:38,780
And that's it.

1995
02:14:38,780 --> 02:14:40,540
That's our chatters F yous.

1996
02:14:40,540 --> 02:15:04,540
I can entertain people, I'm sober.

1997
02:15:04,540 --> 02:15:08,580
Nellie, what do you want to do to entertain our listeners?

1998
02:15:08,580 --> 02:15:09,660
I don't know.

1999
02:15:09,660 --> 02:15:13,820
Let's hear some Mets wisdom, Mets drunken wisdom.

2000
02:15:13,820 --> 02:15:16,320
Burp.

2001
02:15:16,320 --> 02:15:19,500
I'm so tired.

2002
02:15:19,500 --> 02:15:23,100
Oh, a deep thought.

2003
02:15:23,100 --> 02:15:24,020
42 had another one.

2004
02:15:24,020 --> 02:15:26,140
F you to my fucking computer for causing

2005
02:15:26,140 --> 02:15:28,660
that fucking echo on the air.

2006
02:15:28,660 --> 02:15:31,180
Amen.

2007
02:15:31,180 --> 02:15:32,140
Where did X Defer go?

2008
02:15:32,140 --> 02:15:34,020
Don't kick him in the butt when he's passed out.

2009
02:15:34,020 --> 02:15:36,020
I kick him in the butt all the time.

2010
02:15:36,020 --> 02:15:37,520
At least I didn't kick him in the balls.

2011
02:15:37,520 --> 02:15:41,520
I'm going to pass on the third.

2012
02:15:41,520 --> 02:15:43,020
Don't fall asleep.

2013
02:15:43,020 --> 02:15:44,520
I'm not falling asleep.

2014
02:15:44,520 --> 02:15:45,020
X.

2015
02:15:45,020 --> 02:15:45,520
I'm tired.

2016
02:15:45,520 --> 02:15:47,520
My stomach is fucking full.

2017
02:15:47,520 --> 02:15:50,520
I really don't know what to do with the show at this point.

2018
02:15:50,520 --> 02:15:53,020
Let's go to a break.

2019
02:15:53,020 --> 02:15:56,520
That's always a good thing to do when the show is going crazy.

2020
02:15:56,520 --> 02:16:00,520
My stomach is full of alcohol.

2021
02:16:00,520 --> 02:16:06,520
We're going to give Loki some time to cheer up.

2022
02:16:06,520 --> 02:16:08,520
DarkSakura, you said you wanted to hear something earlier.

2023
02:16:08,520 --> 02:16:09,520
What do you want to hear?

2024
02:16:09,520 --> 02:16:10,520
I forgot.

2025
02:16:10,520 --> 02:16:13,520
Well, anything off the top of your head?

2026
02:16:13,520 --> 02:16:14,520
Taku.

2027
02:16:14,520 --> 02:16:15,520
Taku.

2028
02:16:15,520 --> 02:16:18,520
Voltage by the one and only Taku.

2029
02:16:18,520 --> 02:16:19,520
How's that?

2030
02:16:19,520 --> 02:16:20,520
It works.

2031
02:16:20,520 --> 02:16:21,520
Alright.

2032
02:16:21,520 --> 02:16:22,520
Some 2DX done.

2033
02:16:22,520 --> 02:16:23,520
We'll do a 2DX break.

2034
02:16:23,520 --> 02:16:26,520
We'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.

2035
02:16:26,520 --> 02:16:27,520
Maybe some Ask Orange Lounge.

2036
02:16:27,520 --> 02:16:28,520
Whatever we can come up with.

2037
02:16:28,520 --> 02:16:29,520
We'll be back.

2038
02:18:59,520 --> 02:19:01,520
I wish that I was you

2039
02:19:04,520 --> 02:19:07,520
I wish that I was me

2040
02:20:07,520 --> 02:20:09,520
Red! Red! Blue! Wild!

2041
02:20:10,520 --> 02:20:13,520
Red! Red! Blue! Wild!

2042
02:21:13,520 --> 02:21:29,520
I am a young punk, yeah, a punk for the bad guys

2043
02:21:29,520 --> 02:21:36,520
I'm a young punk, yeah, all right, yeah

2044
02:21:36,520 --> 02:21:40,520
You've got to keep a heart of steel,

2045
02:21:40,520 --> 02:21:43,520
Call it who the fuck is the seal,

2046
02:21:43,520 --> 02:21:46,520
Call it who the fuck is the seal,

2047
02:21:46,520 --> 02:21:49,520
or die.

2048
02:21:49,520 --> 02:21:51,520
I can't lie, I'm the killer,

2049
02:21:51,520 --> 02:21:56,520
I am the sickest guy.

2050
02:21:56,520 --> 02:21:58,520
I can't lie, I'm the killer,

2051
02:21:58,520 --> 02:22:03,520
I am the sickest guy.

2052
02:23:03,520 --> 02:23:18,120
I've seen those videos of, like, the guys playing all the stuff one-handed.

2053
02:23:18,120 --> 02:23:22,080
It's got to be the most demoralizing bit of footage you could ever watch for 2DX.

2054
02:23:22,080 --> 02:23:23,080
For the people who don't know...

2055
02:23:23,080 --> 02:23:26,760
Those videos just scream, Americans suck at 2DX.

2056
02:23:26,760 --> 02:23:30,960
For the people who don't know what ketsujin means, it means Iron Man.

2057
02:23:30,960 --> 02:23:32,320
It's named that for a reason.

2058
02:23:32,320 --> 02:23:36,320
You know, those are some absolutely fantastic players.

2059
02:23:36,320 --> 02:23:40,320
It's like, is that trying to spin off on Iron Chef, like Iron 2DX?

2060
02:23:40,320 --> 02:23:44,320
I don't know, it's like, you know, like Tekken for 2DX.

2061
02:23:44,320 --> 02:23:47,320
You know, the king of iron fingering.

2062
02:23:47,320 --> 02:23:49,320
Whoa!

2063
02:23:49,320 --> 02:23:50,320
Never mind, I said another...

2064
02:23:50,320 --> 02:23:53,320
Remember that part about adult content?

2065
02:23:53,320 --> 02:24:00,320
Um, I was referring to this in a completely innocent manner, you pervert.

2066
02:24:00,320 --> 02:24:05,080
I think we know what our last week on Orange Lounge clip will be.

2067
02:24:05,080 --> 02:24:06,440
OK, you can bite me now.

2068
02:24:06,440 --> 02:24:12,200
Join us every Sunday night from 7 PM until 9 PM Pacific Standard Time

2069
02:24:12,200 --> 02:24:17,120
for the Orange Lounge with your hosts, Dark Sakura and Skye,

2070
02:24:17,120 --> 02:24:20,720
where we'll talk about all things Bomani and Densim.

2071
02:24:20,720 --> 02:24:24,240
In the meantime, enjoy our Bomani music and more program.

2072
02:24:24,240 --> 02:24:29,240
Another classic bite there.

2073
02:24:29,240 --> 02:24:33,240
Yes!

2074
02:24:33,240 --> 02:24:41,240
We just had an incident in the studio, so we needed to do one more song, guys, and we'll explain what's going on when we come back.

2075
02:24:41,240 --> 02:24:46,240
I gotta run and get something real quick. We'll explain what's going on when we come back.

2076
02:24:46,240 --> 02:24:51,240
How are you doing over there, DarkSakura?

2077
02:24:51,240 --> 02:24:53,240
I'm almost sober again.

2078
02:24:54,240 --> 02:24:57,240
You know my tolerance, and you know how fucking much it takes me.

2079
02:24:57,240 --> 02:25:00,240
What just happened surprisingly sobered me up, especially.

2080
02:25:00,240 --> 02:25:01,240
So we'll be back right after this.

2081
02:25:01,240 --> 02:25:03,240
I just sat here going, wow.

2082
02:25:03,240 --> 02:25:08,240
We'll be back right after this song from Xtreme USA with more Orange Lounge.

2083
02:25:33,240 --> 02:25:37,240
Love, yeah

2084
02:25:37,240 --> 02:25:39,240
I never felt a major change

2085
02:25:39,240 --> 02:25:40,240
But I swear

2086
02:25:40,240 --> 02:25:42,240
A thousand years and countless days

2087
02:25:42,240 --> 02:25:44,240
So give me a lay

2088
02:25:44,240 --> 02:25:46,240
So give me a little talk

2089
02:25:46,240 --> 02:25:50,240
My prayers are for love, love

2090
02:25:50,240 --> 02:25:53,240
Love, love, love

2091
02:25:53,240 --> 02:25:55,240
Some may be love

2092
02:25:55,240 --> 02:25:57,240
Love, love

2093
02:25:57,240 --> 02:26:00,240

Night 25

2122
02:26:28,240 --> 02:26:29,240
Night sight

2123
02:26:29,240 --> 02:26:32,240
Simply being loved

2124
02:26:32,240 --> 02:26:36,240
Is more than enough

2125
02:26:36,240 --> 02:26:39,240
Simply being loved

2126
02:26:39,240 --> 02:26:43,240
Is more than enough

2127
02:26:43,240 --> 02:26:46,240
Simply being loved

2128
02:26:46,240 --> 02:26:49,240
Is more than enough

2129
02:26:49,240 --> 02:26:51,240
Alright, we're back here on Orange Lounge Radio

2130
02:26:51,240 --> 02:26:55,240
That was BT, Simply Being Loved

2131
02:26:55,240 --> 02:27:02,440
yeah so um gosh how do we explain this um basically what happened during the

2132
02:27:02,440 --> 02:27:07,900
last break there he puked yeah basically low-key parked on his pants he didn't

2133
02:27:07,900 --> 02:27:13,000
quite make it to the toilet he just kind of sat there oh and then suddenly he was

2134
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:18,280
like I have an announcement bleh so we're not sure we there's one more spot

2135
02:27:18,280 --> 02:27:22,120
that needs to be wiped up too so I'm thinking the same the carpet I hope not

2136
02:27:22,120 --> 02:27:26,840
so he's he's being addressed by Nellie right now surprisingly that sobered me

2137
02:27:26,840 --> 02:27:31,740
up to have that happen I've been sitting here sober for the past 10 15 minutes

2138
02:27:31,740 --> 02:27:39,340
no we're not really sure I'm wearing my skirt with the tag tonight I think go

2139
02:27:39,340 --> 02:27:44,020
for it fucking be hot if it kills me you can't you can't even notice it super

2140
02:27:44,020 --> 02:27:49,400
fine all right so we don't really know what to do with the rest of the show

2141
02:27:49,400 --> 02:27:53,240
here because Loki's kind of gone now I think really see he'll be out for a few

2142
02:27:53,240 --> 02:27:57,180
more minutes at least we saw the podcast we got to do after this I don't know

2143
02:27:57,180 --> 02:28:03,020
what we're gonna do the final drink count what is tonight's final drink out

2144
02:28:03,020 --> 02:28:09,180
how much did you have to drink dark Sakura ten shots I think I I finished

2145
02:28:09,180 --> 02:28:11,980
off with the nine because I had eight shots in Malibu and then a Guinness

2146
02:28:11,980 --> 02:28:16,900
which counts as one shot shots but he puked look yet how much 10 10 but he

2147
02:28:16,900 --> 02:28:18,580
I'm sober

2148
02:28:18,580 --> 02:28:20,260
If I had had one more shot

2149
02:28:20,260 --> 02:28:23,340
I probably would have puked because I was at that point where I was like I'm gonna barf

2150
02:28:23,340 --> 02:28:26,220
But I didn't I got silly and then I'm okay

2151
02:28:30,040 --> 02:28:36,040
Wow, that's the first time that's happened by the way on a drunk show we done in three years of orange lunch radio

2152
02:28:37,740 --> 02:28:42,420
In in the three years of Orange Lounge radio, we've had how many drunk shows about five

2153
02:28:42,420 --> 02:28:49,860
it's probably better. Even when I got really shitfaced, I didn't puke and just ate waffles.

2154
02:28:49,860 --> 02:28:54,220
One of them you passed out in my bed. I didn't pass out. Remember, I was making commentary

2155
02:28:54,220 --> 02:28:59,740
from your bedroom. That's the closest that we've had to a barfing experience. I did not

2156
02:28:59,740 --> 02:29:04,100
pass out, however. Alright. Do you remember I was screaming at you from your bedroom?

2157
02:29:04,100 --> 02:29:09,440
I vaguely felt it. That was the same episode. And then I went, waffle! That was the same

2158
02:29:09,440 --> 02:29:13,920
episode where I was kicking the wall, running up and down, yelling, I'm in the matrix, I'm

2159
02:29:13,920 --> 02:29:19,760
in the matrix. That was great. Did it happen again? Are you okay? I thought you were sober.

2160
02:29:19,760 --> 02:29:24,680
You don't look sober. Loki, can you... Okay, I'm gonna get Loki some cookies. Loki, pick

2161
02:29:24,680 --> 02:29:29,400
up the microphone. Can you pick up the microphone down there? I thought he was sobering up.

2162
02:29:29,400 --> 02:29:34,640
He looks drunker. Hello? Uh-huh. Loki, tell the chatroom how you're feeling. I'm feeling

2163
02:29:34,640 --> 02:29:41,480
incredibly dizzy and I think I just threw up earlier yeah you did cuz you're

2164
02:29:41,480 --> 02:29:47,860
wearing my clothes now might I point out yeah I am I I've drank too much honestly

2165
02:29:47,860 --> 02:29:52,740
normally I drink a lot more water to coincide with my you know drinking

2166
02:29:52,740 --> 02:29:57,820
alcohol so I don't feel like you know I have to eat a cookie I know I'm not

2167
02:29:57,820 --> 02:30:04,620
hungry I can't eat the cookie right now honestly I don't care if you can eat

2168
02:30:04,620 --> 02:30:08,700
Eat it or not, fucking eat the cookie to neutralize the alcohol in your stomach.

2169
02:30:08,700 --> 02:30:10,180
I will be sick, honestly.

2170
02:30:10,180 --> 02:30:11,180
Get a cracker.

2171
02:30:11,180 --> 02:30:12,180
What about me?

2172
02:30:12,180 --> 02:30:13,180
We can.

2173
02:30:13,180 --> 02:30:19,780
Just give me a second to freaking, you know, honestly, to digest this, just give me some

2174
02:30:19,780 --> 02:30:21,740
water and I'll be fine, okay?

2175
02:30:21,740 --> 02:30:28,260
Because if I drink any more, I'm honestly very full right now and I can't drink any

2176
02:30:28,260 --> 02:30:33,220
more, you know, alcohol or anything to be, you know, honest.

2177
02:30:33,220 --> 02:30:41,420
I just, I feel honestly tired as hell, this is why you shouldn't drink folks, I mean honestly,

2178
02:30:41,420 --> 02:30:50,620
cause you'll end up like me, and that's not good, but um, just, just whatever, I mean

2179
02:30:50,620 --> 02:31:00,220
honestly, they got my family stopped listening to this show like long ago, so, it's not good,

2180
02:31:00,220 --> 02:31:11,220
Just don't go crazy with the alcohol and just take it easy, you know, have some fun with the fireworks and whatnot and whatever.

2181
02:31:11,220 --> 02:31:14,220
I'm tired, I need the nap.

2182
02:31:14,220 --> 02:31:17,220
Just don't fall asleep and get my computer wet with that water.

2183
02:31:17,220 --> 02:31:24,220
No, I'm not. I'm taking care of the computer because I built this computer so I don't know what it needs, you know.

2184
02:31:24,220 --> 02:31:31,220
does not need the excess alcohol dripped all over it

2185
02:31:31,860 --> 02:31:35,780
what the hell are you playing?

2186
02:31:35,780 --> 02:31:40,820
i mean it's bad enough that my stomach hurts i mean so

2187
02:31:40,820 --> 02:31:45,780
folks people take it easy on the alcohol don't go crazy with the fire

2188
02:31:45,780 --> 02:31:50,340
you're good

2189
02:31:50,340 --> 02:31:52,340
What does the 4th of July mean to you, Loki?

2190
02:31:56,340 --> 02:31:58,340
Turn on your mic, turn on your mic.

2191
02:31:58,340 --> 02:32:00,340
Your mic's off.

2192
02:32:00,340 --> 02:32:02,340
When is the 4th of July meeting you?

2193
02:32:30,340 --> 02:32:32,340
I don't care. Whatever.

2194
02:32:32,340 --> 02:32:34,340
Have you learned a lesson from today's episode?

2195
02:32:34,340 --> 02:32:36,340
Number 11!

2196
02:32:36,340 --> 02:32:40,340
My lesson from today's episode is drink more water before I start drinking.

2197
02:32:40,340 --> 02:32:42,340
Other than that...

2198
02:32:42,340 --> 02:32:46,340
The lesson of the easy is no one can fucking out drink me! Ha ha ha!

2199
02:32:46,340 --> 02:32:48,340
Ugh!

2200
02:32:48,340 --> 02:32:50,340
Whatever.

2201
02:32:50,340 --> 02:32:52,340
I will go back to the liquor bottle.

2202
02:32:52,340 --> 02:32:54,340
Whatever, Jamie.

2203
02:32:54,340 --> 02:32:56,340
We do shots at the club tonight.

2204
02:32:56,340 --> 02:32:58,340
Fine.

2205
02:32:58,340 --> 02:33:05,340

2206
02:33:08,780 --> 02:33:14,100

2207
02:33:14,100 --> 02:33:15,420
listen folks okay

2208
02:33:15,420 --> 02:33:20,020
the room is spinning a lot less than it was before okay

2209
02:33:20,020 --> 02:33:22,020
water? I have water?

2210
02:33:22,020 --> 02:33:25,140
oooh yay

2211
02:33:25,140 --> 02:33:28,760

2212
02:33:28,760 --> 02:33:31,160

2213
02:33:31,160 --> 02:33:34,280

2214
02:33:34,280 --> 02:33:37,480
but you know what when i become sober

2215
02:33:37,480 --> 02:33:43,920

2216
02:33:43,920 --> 02:33:46,840
don't you be making fun of me now okay

2217
02:33:46,840 --> 02:33:51,000
cause when i'm sober you aren't complaining okay

2218
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:58,000
he thinks he's going to get some. Is he? Once he's sober, yes. Damn sure he's going to

2219
02:33:58,120 --> 02:34:05,120
get some. When I'm sober, it's not complaining. When there's no puke on his breath. When he

2220
02:34:05,320 --> 02:34:08,520
can get it up. You need a breath mint, Logan? Extra for her, don't you have some breath

2221
02:34:08,520 --> 02:34:15,000
mints somewhere? I have penguin mints. Honestly, folks, okay, Rob is like, wooooo, he's all

2222
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:19,240
over the place. Hey, I'm sober now. Let's go drive him. I'm just kidding, no, I'm totally

2223
02:34:19,240 --> 02:34:23,240
If I were to run towards Rob, I would probably hit the wall.

2224
02:34:23,240 --> 02:34:27,240
So what type of drunk am I?

2225
02:34:27,240 --> 02:34:31,240
My nose is numb, okay? My hand is numb.

2226
02:34:31,240 --> 02:34:35,240
So what about my drinking? If Rob gets stupid, what about me?

2227
02:34:35,240 --> 02:34:39,240
See if we can't tell him to open my mouth.

2228
02:34:39,240 --> 02:34:43,240
You get bitchier, because you've been in a bad mood tonight.

2229
02:34:43,240 --> 02:34:47,240
No, I've had reason to be in a bad mood. I'm sorry that I fussed at you.

No, honestly, my stomach feels a little upset, but other than that, I'm fine.

02:36:19,080 --> 02:36:22,080
No, you're fine.

I'm fine!

2245
02:36:25,080 --> 02:36:36,080
Don't be judging me just because I had a lot of acid in my stomach from the stupid minestrone.

2246
02:36:36,080 --> 02:36:41,080
I'm fine right now, okay? If I drink some more water, I'll be fine.

2247
02:36:44,080 --> 02:36:47,080
Just... I'm drinking water, okay?

2248
02:36:54,080 --> 02:36:57,080
What the fuck is with this music, okay?

2249
02:36:57,080 --> 02:36:59,080
You need to fucking turn this shit off?

2250

I am fine.

2251
02:37:00,080 --> 02:37:02,080
I'm playing something that doesn't lick my ass.

2252
02:37:02,080 --> 02:37:05,080
I'm fine, I just feel ill.

2253
02:37:09,080 --> 02:37:14,080
I need to put my thumb on the webcam because my thumb is mutilated now thanks to Guinness.

2254
02:37:17,080 --> 02:37:23,080
I really don't know what to say to our listeners who have stuck with us through such crap radio tonight.

2255
02:37:23,080 --> 02:37:31,080
Oh, God. Look, he's gonna barf again. Is he gonna barf again? Nellie, please make sure his head lands on my toilet.

2256
02:37:31,080 --> 02:37:42,080
Ew, I just heard that. Oh, shit.

2257
02:37:42,080 --> 02:37:47,080
Hey, but it was a liquid puke, which is good, because that means he's just throwing up alcohol.

2258
02:37:47,080 --> 02:37:51,560
I have had too many damn cookies. Boys and girls...

2259
02:37:51,560 --> 02:37:54,880
I am having a sugar rush and liquor right now. I hope

2260
02:37:54,880 --> 02:37:59,320
I hope you boys and girls learn something from this. Drinking so much

2261
02:37:59,320 --> 02:38:00,760
turns you into an ass.

2262
02:38:00,760 --> 02:38:03,840
A complete and utter ass. Drinking makes me horny.

2263
02:38:03,840 --> 02:38:07,960
Whoa! Whoa! No, no, no!

2264
02:38:07,960 --> 02:38:13,600
Whoa! Okay, now what drinking does is it makes me into a cuddle whore.

2265
02:38:13,600 --> 02:38:16,600
Drinking makes me a cuddle whore.

OK, we're going to go look and admire it.

2279
02:38:57,600 --> 02:38:58,640
Cuke break!

2280
02:38:58,640 --> 02:39:03,920
Send a message to Skye if you have a question for Ask Orange Lounge.

2281
02:39:03,920 --> 02:39:05,120
In the meantime, we're going to get to...

2282
02:39:05,120 --> 02:39:10,160
Bamani Popepuri, boys and girls, started off with...

2283
02:39:10,160 --> 02:39:11,120
I don't know.

2284
02:39:11,120 --> 02:39:15,120
How about something from 2DX 10th style?

2285
02:39:16,120 --> 02:39:18,120
I'm by myself right now, that's kind of scary.

2286
02:39:18,120 --> 02:39:21,120
And I'm starting to sober up, but I'm like in that buzzed phase.

2287
02:39:24,120 --> 02:39:28,120
We'll be back with more of this fun stuff.

2288
02:39:28,120 --> 02:39:30,120
We'll talk about video games at some point too.

2289
02:39:30,120 --> 02:39:37,120
1.2, Meteos, cool game, play it.

2290
02:41:00,120 --> 02:41:02,120
I can't wait to see you

2291
02:41:02,120 --> 02:41:04,120
It's time to change

2292
02:42:02,120 --> 02:42:05,120
Baby, aye, aye, aye, aye

2293
02:42:05,120 --> 02:42:09,120
Too light as amber, always deep inside of my mind

2294
02:42:09,120 --> 02:42:12,120
Tell me, why, aye, aye, aye

2295
02:42:12,120 --> 02:42:16,120
You keep the pockets full of grim, grim dollars

2296
02:42:16,120 --> 02:42:19,120
I love you, boy, it's your time

2297
02:42:19,120 --> 02:42:21,120
You're very hard, you look like

2298
02:42:21,120 --> 02:42:26,120
Hey, young fella, take me overnight

2299
02:42:26,120 --> 02:42:28,120
Boom, boom, boom, boom

2300
02:42:58,120 --> 02:43:16,560
We wrote this song, specially for you It's for everything you do

2301
02:43:16,560 --> 02:43:20,560
You are the best, don't get undressed

2302
02:43:20,560 --> 02:43:22,560
You are the cutest, that's why far

2303
02:43:22,560 --> 02:43:26,560
You took a risk, and bought our dishes

2304
02:43:26,560 --> 02:43:29,560
You play it loudly in your car

2305
02:43:29,560 --> 02:43:32,560
You tell your friends, what about our band

2306
02:43:32,560 --> 02:43:34,560
We're intimate, this is what you are

2307
02:43:34,560 --> 02:43:47,560

2308
02:43:53,560 --> 02:44:00,560
When we play a show, it's good to know you are in the crowd

2309
02:44:00,560 --> 02:44:02,560
We hear you scream so loud

2310
02:44:02,560 --> 02:44:04,560
You like to dance

2311
02:44:04,560 --> 02:44:06,560
And take a chance

2312
02:44:06,560 --> 02:44:08,560
So throw your undies on the stage

2313
02:44:08,560 --> 02:44:10,560
No wait

2314
02:44:10,560 --> 02:44:12,560
You're underage

2315
02:44:12,560 --> 02:44:14,560
You send us email every day

2316
02:44:14,560 --> 02:44:16,560
Shop at Target

2317
02:44:16,560 --> 02:44:18,560

We're on the road

It's super spro-bro-fro-fro-fro-fro

2329
02:45:04,360 --> 02:45:06,360
We'll just ask for one thing more

2330
02:45:06,360 --> 02:45:10,360
Come see our tour, you will agree

2340
02:45:43,360 --> 02:46:08,780
The super star that is what you are The super star that is what you are

2341
02:46:08,780 --> 02:46:21,060
Last week on Orange Lounge Radio.

2342
02:46:21,060 --> 02:46:23,220
Who was the last person to put their coin up?

2343
02:46:23,220 --> 02:46:26,040
I'm going after that person to hell with the rescue.

2344
02:46:26,040 --> 02:46:28,500
Although I almost got killed by a little kid.

2345
02:46:28,500 --> 02:46:31,940
I think a little four-year-old threatened to cut me at Stockton Golf Line when I got

2346
02:46:31,940 --> 02:46:35,700
up there and said, I'm playing because this person put their token up.

2347
02:46:35,700 --> 02:46:45,740
where is your mother your mother just left you here for me to babysit you go

2348
02:46:45,740 --> 02:46:49,020
away mommy's on the corner she's earning dinner

2349
02:46:49,020 --> 02:46:55,700
money oh my these opinions he's looking for daddy join us every Sunday night

2350
02:46:55,700 --> 02:47:01,740
from 7 p.m. until 9 p.m. Pacific Standard Time for the orange lounge with

2351
02:47:01,740 --> 02:47:08,740
With your hosts, DarkSakura and Sky, where we'll talk about all things Bomani and Bensum.

2352
02:47:08,740 --> 02:47:12,740
In the meantime, enjoy our Romani Music and More program.

2353
02:47:38,740 --> 02:47:43,060
And he's the one that kind of a low-key is like wagging his tongue at me. What the hell?

2354
02:47:44,140 --> 02:47:48,180
And then look at his people low-key. Do you have the microphone? Can you have low-key the microphone?

2355
02:47:48,580 --> 02:47:50,940
Make sure it's on there. How are you feeling? Are you?

2356
02:47:53,780 --> 02:47:56,980
Yeah, I threw up quite a bit that break

2357
02:47:59,300 --> 02:48:04,740
Just probably because I had a lot of like miss, you know a lot of acid beforehand I

2358
02:48:04,740 --> 02:48:13,740
Um, I was eating a, um, it was runny beforehand, and so that's, you know, a lot of tomato soup, and that's very acidy, so.

2359
02:48:13,740 --> 02:48:18,740
I actually only throw up when I have, um, citrus mixture, so that does make sense.

2360
02:48:18,740 --> 02:48:26,740
I just feel really, you know, wasted right now, and not very tired, and not very good.

2361
02:48:26,740 --> 02:48:33,740
I mean, just, I'm completely out of it, so it's not even funny.

2362
02:48:33,740 --> 02:48:40,440
just out of it okay all right well you can participate as you want to in this

2363
02:48:40,440 --> 02:48:44,360
next segment I will participate as best as I can but we figure since our

2364
02:48:44,360 --> 02:48:48,980
listeners have been so good and putting up with the last hour of this show which

2365
02:48:48,980 --> 02:48:56,440
has been kind of crappy yeah I understand that's this this part of the

2366
02:48:56,440 --> 02:48:59,360
actually some of them are gonna kick out of it so whatever we only do this once

2367
02:48:59,360 --> 02:49:08,360
This part of the show is for you. This is your chance to take the show in any direction you want to by asking Orange Lounge.

2368
02:49:13,360 --> 02:49:20,360
Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question. What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?

2369
02:49:20,360 --> 02:49:28,360
Will Nellie keep taunting me while I am drunk or will she continue to dance a jig while her boyfriend pukes me?

2370
02:49:31,360 --> 02:49:33,360
Don't you be talking to yourself about me.

2371
02:49:33,360 --> 02:49:37,360
Rob, that's actually the best opening song you have ever done.

2372
02:49:37,360 --> 02:49:39,360
And to think I had to be drunk to improvise that.

2373
02:49:39,360 --> 02:49:43,360
I can't believe that I was actually singing in technical public.

2374
02:49:44,360 --> 02:49:46,360
Cause you know how afraid I am of singing.

2375
02:49:46,360 --> 02:49:52,440
You know, if I just breathe in and out very deeply, I can probably become coherent enough

2376
02:49:52,440 --> 02:49:54,640
to actually answer questions or anything.

2377
02:49:54,640 --> 02:49:58,280
Alright, well this first one's directed towards the one and only DarkSakura, actually.

2378
02:49:58,280 --> 02:49:59,520
I thank God for that.

2379
02:49:59,520 --> 02:50:06,120
The question comes from DeepThought42, and now DeepThoughts with Jack Handy.

2380
02:50:06,120 --> 02:50:07,120
Alright, here it is.

2381
02:50:07,120 --> 02:50:08,120
DarkSakura, are you ready?

2382
02:50:08,120 --> 02:50:10,560
We used to go to the cave to see our Uncle Bear.

2383
02:50:10,560 --> 02:50:14,760
We called him Uncle Bear because he lived in the cave, and sometimes he'd eat one of

2384
02:50:14,760 --> 02:50:15,760
us.

2385
02:50:15,760 --> 02:50:19,760
Later on, we found out he actually was a bear.

2386
02:50:19,760 --> 02:50:23,360
They say that every time an, uh, a, a, what am I, shit.

2387
02:50:23,360 --> 02:50:26,960
The face of the child can say it all, especially the mouse part.

2388
02:50:26,960 --> 02:50:31,760
They say that every time a bell rings, an angel gets its wings, but what they don't

2389
02:50:31,760 --> 02:50:35,760
tell you is, every time a mouse trap snaps, an angel gets set on fire.

2390
02:50:35,760 --> 02:50:36,760
Anyway.

2391
02:50:36,760 --> 02:50:38,760
I love Deep Thought.

2392
02:50:38,760 --> 02:50:43,120
Um, Deep Thought 42, you, you were saying something earlier about how you, when you're

2393
02:50:43,120 --> 02:50:45,560
drinking, you become a big cuddle whore.

2394
02:50:45,560 --> 02:50:49,760
So DeepThought42 wants to know, will Jamie cuddle with me?

2395
02:50:49,760 --> 02:50:52,360
I'd have to ask my fiance.

2396
02:50:52,360 --> 02:50:56,440
And I would imagine that Dark Sacra has the following requirements.

2397
02:50:56,440 --> 02:50:59,120
First of all, you need to have good hygiene, because if you have B.O., she's not going

2398
02:50:59,120 --> 02:51:00,120
to cuddle with you.

2399
02:51:00,120 --> 02:51:01,120
Right.

2400
02:51:01,120 --> 02:51:07,000
And second of all, you have to not be an idiot, because Dark Sacra doesn't cuddle with idiots.

2401
02:51:07,000 --> 02:51:08,280
And you have to have good grammar.

2402
02:51:08,280 --> 02:51:11,480
You are listening to Orange Lawn's radio, which is some plus points there.

2403
02:51:11,480 --> 02:51:13,400
That means that you're not a complete idiot.

2404
02:51:13,400 --> 02:51:14,400
Yes, very good.

2405
02:51:14,400 --> 02:51:20,400
You have to have excellent grammar and great annunciation skills.

2406
02:51:20,400 --> 02:51:21,400
Alright.

2407
02:51:21,400 --> 02:51:23,400
Are those like your turn-ons?

2408
02:51:23,400 --> 02:51:27,400
Oh my god, grammar makes me so fucking horny!

2409
02:51:27,400 --> 02:51:28,400
Oh no.

2410
02:51:28,400 --> 02:51:32,400
Wow, now I know what clip I'm going to use in the next intro.

2411
02:51:32,400 --> 02:51:33,400
No!

2412
02:51:33,400 --> 02:51:34,400
And now...

2413
02:51:34,400 --> 02:51:35,400
And now...

2414
02:51:35,400 --> 02:51:41,400
And now I just said that monkeys make her horny.

2415
02:51:41,400 --> 02:51:44,400
Call 1-900-DARK-SACRIA!

2416
02:51:44,400 --> 02:51:44,900
Shut up!

2417
02:51:44,900 --> 02:51:48,900
Her turn-ons are good grammar, and guys that-

2418
02:51:48,900 --> 02:51:50,400
And Xanadu!

2419
02:51:50,400 --> 02:51:52,400
Guys that have good hygiene!

2420
02:51:52,400 --> 02:51:56,400
My turn-ons are Electric Light Orchestra and good grammar!

2421
02:51:56,400 --> 02:51:58,400
Her turn-offs are Spielberg-directed-

2422
02:51:58,400 --> 02:52:01,400
I'd get off on Sesame Street, yo!

2423
02:52:01,400 --> 02:52:04,400
Let's get passed out!

2424
02:52:04,400 --> 02:52:08,400
Please stop with the talking about what turn-ons are.

2425
02:52:08,400 --> 02:52:11,640
42 is just like, you know, he doesn't meet those requirements. He does have good hygiene.

2426
02:52:11,640 --> 02:52:16,560
Okay, as soon as he stops using the letter U instead of Y-O-U.

2427
02:52:16,560 --> 02:52:22,320
Okay. Ron Chan has a question. I just want to, like, get this alcohol out

2428
02:52:22,320 --> 02:52:25,600
of my system, like A-S-O-C. You need to be saving your energy for the

2429
02:52:25,600 --> 02:52:28,080
podcast. Right. Okay, whatever.

2430
02:52:28,080 --> 02:52:32,640
Ron Chan has a question. Here's my question. You said on the podcast that Bomberman D.S.

2431
02:52:32,640 --> 02:52:37,720
was $20. Where the hell did you find it for $20? Because I sure as hell couldn't. That

2432
02:52:37,720 --> 02:52:40,940
There was actually Miklotov that ended up buying that for $20. I don't know where he

2433
02:52:40,940 --> 02:52:45,480
bought it, but knowing him, it was probably EB Games or GameStop, one of the two, because

2434
02:52:45,480 --> 02:52:51,160
he used to work for EB Games before he was at Konami. And who else sells? Actually, you

2435
02:52:51,160 --> 02:52:56,160
know what? I saw a good deal on Meteos at Target, of all places. They only wanted $29.99

2436
02:52:56,160 --> 02:53:02,600
as opposed to $39.99 for it, so that was good. So, shop around. Check Frugal as a part of

2437
02:53:02,600 --> 02:53:06,400
Google, if nothing else, and you'll find a good deal there. From what I understand, though,

2438
02:53:06,400 --> 02:53:11,400
I know that you're probably a little late for this, but Circuit City apparently had a really good deal on video games today.

2439
02:53:11,400 --> 02:53:18,400
Like, they were selling $10 video games today, like Amplitude, and what's that GameCube roleplaying game, Byte and Kaitos or whatever?

2440
02:53:18,400 --> 02:53:21,400
Those were all like $10 today. Pretty cool, huh?

2441
02:53:21,400 --> 02:53:23,400
Alright.

2442
02:53:23,400 --> 02:53:30,400
Oh, DeepThought42 wants you to know that his father is an English professor.

2443
02:53:30,400 --> 02:53:32,400
I'm sorry, English. I'm drunk.

2444
02:53:32,400 --> 02:53:35,400
His father is an English professor.

2445
02:53:35,400 --> 02:53:42,900
That's awfully tempting. That's pretty hot. However, I am highly taken. My fiancé is excellent.

2446
02:53:42,900 --> 02:53:47,900
It's just a cuddle. It's just a cuddle. It's not making out. It's not sex.

2447
02:53:47,900 --> 02:53:57,900
Alright, Vidpowel wants to know, is the OLR crew doing anything worth mentioning on the 4th of July?

2448
02:53:57,900 --> 02:54:03,900
We know that Loki has to deal with his family tomorrow.

2449
02:54:03,900 --> 02:54:08,480
Oh my god. I'm sorry, oh my car.

2450
02:54:08,480 --> 02:54:12,720
Cause my car is God. I'm so dizzy right now, it's not even funny.

2451
02:54:12,720 --> 02:54:16,640
Are you gonna barf? Cause if so, you need to go back to the bathroom. I'm not gonna throw up, nah.

2452
02:54:16,640 --> 02:54:19,920
I'm just really dizzy. If I take...

2453
02:54:19,920 --> 02:54:23,240
In fact, if my stomach is fine, I'll be fine.

2454
02:54:23,240 --> 02:54:28,200
You look kinda bloated. Seriously!

2455
02:54:28,200 --> 02:54:33,240
Okay, what is the first thing that alcohol does that makes you brutally honest with everybody?

2456
02:54:33,240 --> 02:54:36,760
So, like, how... what was it Margaret Cho said about grappa?

2457
02:54:36,760 --> 02:54:41,040
You have that skin! Oh, you look bloated.

2458
02:54:41,040 --> 02:54:46,400
So you're eating meat on the 4th of July? Yeah, I'm not going into the vegetarian thing yet.

2459
02:54:46,400 --> 02:54:49,760
I don't know what I'm doing for the 4th of July. I actually have no plans.

2460
02:54:49,760 --> 02:54:54,200
Why don't you come hang out with us? Possibly. We were gonna have people over for movies, but we don't know yet.

2461
02:54:54,200 --> 02:54:57,500
Rob, you need to come hang out with us. You need to meet

2462
02:54:57,500 --> 02:55:00,640
Adam and Tina and all my friends. I can probably do that.

2463
02:55:00,640 --> 02:55:02,640
I call them my downside friends.

2464
02:55:02,640 --> 02:55:04,640
Give me a call tomorrow when we're sober.

2465
02:55:04,640 --> 02:55:06,640
You got it.

2466
02:55:06,640 --> 02:55:10,640
I think that's going to bring another show to a close, boys and girls.

2467
02:55:10,640 --> 02:55:13,640
Thank God, because this show is really starting to go downhill fast.

2468
02:55:13,640 --> 02:55:16,640
So now we're going to go around and get everybody,

2469
02:55:16,640 --> 02:55:18,640
and now we're going to try and tape a podcast.

2470
02:55:18,640 --> 02:55:19,640
That should be tons of fun.

2471
02:55:19,640 --> 02:55:23,640
Now we're going to go around and get everybody's final thought.

2472
02:55:23,640 --> 02:55:25,640
DarkSakura, why don't you start us off,

2473
02:55:25,640 --> 02:55:26,640
because you're the most sober out of everybody.

2474
02:55:26,640 --> 02:55:27,640
What's your final thought?

2475
02:55:27,640 --> 02:55:29,640
Reject false icons.

2476
02:55:57,640 --> 02:56:09,840
the final word of the show, one word to sum it all up, thank you guys for listening by

2477
02:56:09,840 --> 02:56:16,920
the way, and if this was your first show tonight, seriously guys, this isn't what it's normally

2478
02:56:16,920 --> 02:56:17,920
like.

2479
02:56:17,920 --> 02:56:18,920
I'm sorry to see your first show.

2480
02:56:18,920 --> 02:56:22,200
We normally are not drunk and louts on the show.

2481
02:56:22,200 --> 02:56:26,080
I didn't even think that because of the iTunes thing we'd have way more listeners this week,

2482
02:56:26,080 --> 02:56:28,620
meaning we'd have way more people who were listening to the show the first time.

2483
02:56:28,620 --> 02:56:29,620
Whoops!

2484
02:56:29,620 --> 02:56:31,820
That was a bad calculation on when to do a drunk show.

2485
02:56:31,820 --> 02:56:32,820
My bad.

2486
02:56:32,820 --> 02:56:38,040
We did the drunk show because, first of all, it is our three-year anniversary, plus it

2487
02:56:38,040 --> 02:56:39,460
is also a three-day weekend.

2488
02:56:39,460 --> 02:56:41,460
We were taking advantage of it.

2489
02:56:41,460 --> 02:56:44,460
Every three-day weekend that comes up, we usually get pissed.

2490
02:56:44,460 --> 02:56:47,400
So, again, tune in next week.

2491
02:56:47,400 --> 02:56:48,400
Give us one more chance.

2492
02:56:48,400 --> 02:56:50,100
I swear we will be sober.

2493
02:56:50,100 --> 02:56:54,900
Loki will probably be highly embarrassed because his family's been listening to him drunk on

2494
02:56:54,900 --> 02:57:02,960
the show, and we'll be full of our usual, you know, piss and angst next week.

2495
02:57:02,960 --> 02:57:07,500
Really quick last minute questions, actually just one, from Dirty Thief, see another new

2496
02:57:07,500 --> 02:57:09,000
name, I don't recognize his name.

2497
02:57:09,000 --> 02:57:13,440
Can Loki share with us his family reactions on the next show?

2498
02:57:13,440 --> 02:57:16,120
Nellie says she'll do it if nothing else.

2499
02:57:16,120 --> 02:57:17,680
Loki's reaching for the microphone.

2500
02:57:17,680 --> 02:57:22,920
Well, my reactions probably to my family is going to be, they'll be like surprised that

2501
02:57:22,920 --> 02:57:26,760
them drunk in the show but they'll probably understand this is a three-day

2502
02:57:26,760 --> 02:57:31,120
weekend it's just a radio stuff other than that you know those just like I

2503
02:57:31,120 --> 02:57:36,880
can't believe we heard you drunk yeah he's gonna sleep well I'm just really

2504
02:57:36,880 --> 02:57:42,800
tired right now and I don't feel so good so I'm just gonna try to like you know

2505
02:57:42,800 --> 02:57:47,160
deal with this alcohol as best I can without making the mess of the apartment

2506
02:57:47,160 --> 02:57:59,160
Alright, final word of the show, one word to sum it all up, Loki, pick that microphone back up and give us one word that sums it all up. See you next week everybody.

2507
02:57:59,160 --> 02:58:04,160
Don't drink and drive is really bad. One word! One word!

2508
02:58:04,160 --> 02:58:12,560
That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.

2509
02:58:12,560 --> 02:58:16,920

2511
02:58:25,800 --> 02:58:34,000
And now, here is your fortune cookie message of the day.

2512
02:58:34,000 --> 02:58:39,000
auto-destruct sequence in 5, 4, 3, 2...

2513
02:58:45,000 --> 02:58:50,000
Whoops! That's not the right track. Hold on. I'm drunk. What can I say? Hold on.

2514
02:58:50,000 --> 02:58:54,000
Here it is. We'll do this track instead. Try this one.

2515
02:58:58,000 --> 02:59:00,000
Captain caught me on the holodeck

2516
02:59:00,000 --> 02:59:05,000
With a blaster in my hand

2517
02:59:05,000 --> 02:59:13,000
He looked so mad, I thought I was out of the band

2518
02:59:13,000 --> 02:59:15,000
I was trying to think of something to say

2519
02:59:15,000 --> 02:59:17,000
But my R2 unit gave me away

2520
02:59:17,000 --> 02:59:19,000
And the captain looked at me and said

2521
02:59:19,000 --> 02:59:21,000
Where's Star Trek band?

2522
02:59:21,000 --> 02:59:26,000
Put the fucking blaster away

2523
02:59:26,000 --> 02:59:28,000
Hurrah!

2524
02:59:30,000 --> 02:59:33,000
Captain caught me on the holodeck

2525
02:59:33,000 --> 02:59:36,000
With a lightsaber in my hand

2526
02:59:38,000 --> 02:59:40,000
And I knew right then

2527
02:59:40,000 --> 02:59:43,000
I was in for a redshirt reprimand

2528
02:59:46,000 --> 02:59:48,000
I was trying to think of something to say

2529
02:59:48,000 --> 02:59:50,000
But my Vader helmet gave me away

2530
02:59:50,000 --> 02:59:52,000
And the captain looked at me and said

2531
02:59:52,000 --> 02:59:57,000
Can't use the force, put the fucking lightsaber away

2532
03:00:03,000 --> 03:00:05,000
Captain caught me on the holodeck

2533
03:00:06,000 --> 03:00:08,000
With my Java in my hand

2534
03:00:11,000 --> 03:00:13,000
A fist full of Vaseline

2535
03:00:14,000 --> 03:00:16,000
All covered in sand

2536
03:00:18,000 --> 03:00:20,000
I was trying to think of something to say

2537
03:00:20,000 --> 03:00:24,700
Something to say, but my naked lair gave me away, and the captain looked at me and said,

2538
03:00:24,700 --> 03:00:29,700
Get the fuck off the holodeck, I'm about to get laid.

2539
03:00:33,200 --> 03:00:34,200
Harranth!

2540
03:00:35,200 --> 03:00:36,200
Harranth!

2541
03:00:37,200 --> 03:00:38,200
Harranth!

2542
03:00:39,200 --> 03:00:40,200
Harranth!

2543
03:00:41,200 --> 03:00:42,200
Harranth!

2544
03:00:43,200 --> 03:00:44,200
Harranth!

2545
03:00:45,200 --> 03:00:46,200
Harranth!

2546
03:00:46,200 --> 03:00:55,480
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.

2547
03:01:16,200 --> 03:01:38,520
Well, kids, what can we say?

2548
03:01:38,520 --> 03:01:40,520
That wraps up another life edition of-

2549
03:01:40,520 --> 03:01:44,800
Don't y'all choose to die in!

2550
03:01:44,800 --> 03:01:49,720
I don't know what else to say. I'm speechless. Tonight was the most interesting episode of

2551
03:01:49,720 --> 03:01:50,720
Orange Laundry.

2552
03:01:50,720 --> 03:01:55,040
Get a fucking-ass radio, man! So drunk!

2553
03:01:55,040 --> 03:01:58,920
I have to go pee so bad. And we're going to do a podcast, so.

2554
03:01:58,920 --> 03:02:01,960
We'll fucking take your piss already. I got Claude to get on, okay?

2555
03:02:01,960 --> 03:02:02,960
Alright, let's go.

2556
03:02:02,960 --> 03:02:04,440
I'm going to borrow your ring to change clothes.

2557
03:02:04,440 --> 03:02:05,880
Reconnect to the stream in 15 seconds.
