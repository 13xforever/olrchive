[SPEAKER_04]: Murder.

28
00:03:38,313 --> 00:03:39,614
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, I know it's a puffy joke.

29
00:03:40,014 --> 00:03:42,055
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to remember my roommate, the extifer.

30
00:03:42,715 --> 00:03:43,676
[SPEAKER_04]: Huge Buffy fan.

31
00:03:43,696 --> 00:03:45,658
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you ever walk into his room and look through the DVD collections?

32
00:03:45,678 --> 00:03:46,899
[SPEAKER_11]: I've seen them from across the hall.

33
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:52,004
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a whole shelf of Buffy and Angel.

34
00:03:52,564 --> 00:03:56,088
[SPEAKER_14]: I am of the happy for the show, but of the angst for other reasons.

35
00:03:56,268 --> 00:03:57,189
[SPEAKER_04]: What a waste of money.

36
00:03:57,589 --> 00:03:58,910
[SPEAKER_14]: Damn you, Hot Topic.

37
00:03:59,211 --> 00:03:59,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn you!

38
00:03:59,931 --> 00:04:01,212
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be getting into that in a little while.

39
00:04:01,232 --> 00:04:02,293
[SPEAKER_04]: We all have a lot of angst.

40
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:03,134
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know about Loki.

41
00:04:03,655 --> 00:04:04,796
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I've got big angst.

42
00:04:04,816 --> 00:04:05,937
[SPEAKER_04]: But I have an refrigerator now!

43
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:07,332
[SPEAKER_04]: That's good.

44
00:04:07,352 --> 00:04:08,313
[SPEAKER_04]: Refrigerators are good.

45
00:04:08,593 --> 00:04:09,293
[SPEAKER_04]: Cold things are good.

46
00:04:09,453 --> 00:04:10,314
[SPEAKER_04]: And the washer and dryer.

47
00:04:10,354 --> 00:04:11,995
[SPEAKER_04]: I have some surprises in the refrigerator right now.

48
00:04:12,015 --> 00:04:16,137
[SPEAKER_14]: I've never been so excited to be able to do my own laundry in a long time.

49
00:04:16,617 --> 00:04:18,138
[SPEAKER_04]: Would it be the fish-tasting ice?

50
00:04:18,938 --> 00:04:20,379
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's not the fish-tasting ice.

51
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:20,920
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut your mouth.

52
00:04:23,661 --> 00:04:25,242
[SPEAKER_04]: You just... I don't... Oh, forget it.

53
00:04:25,282 --> 00:04:30,405
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, in the other corner, Blabbermouth, who talks before he's introduced, Techmaster Loki.

54
00:04:30,745 --> 00:04:31,625
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm allowed to talk.

55
00:04:31,665 --> 00:04:32,486
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm part of the show.

56
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:35,601
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm almost done with my drink!

57
00:04:36,001 --> 00:04:38,123
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki is already one drink down, boys and girls.

58
00:04:38,483 --> 00:04:39,304
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you drinking, Loki?

59
00:04:39,544 --> 00:04:40,785
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm drinking screwdrivers.

60
00:04:40,805 --> 00:04:42,427
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I'm going to be drinking all night long.

61
00:04:42,447 --> 00:04:44,228
[SPEAKER_04]: Screwdrivers, screwdrivers, screwdrivers.

62
00:04:44,268 --> 00:04:45,389
[SPEAKER_04]: Should I get the rest of the liquor?

63
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:47,351
[SPEAKER_14]: I need to be serviced.

64
00:04:47,491 --> 00:04:48,372
[SPEAKER_14]: I need alcohol.

65
00:04:48,812 --> 00:04:49,393
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, hold on.

66
00:04:49,433 --> 00:04:54,798
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to go get the rest of the liquor so DarkSakura can see what I got.

67
00:04:54,858 --> 00:04:55,879
[SPEAKER_26]: I need to mix my own drink.

68
00:04:55,979 --> 00:04:58,541
[SPEAKER_04]: I got $40 worth of liquor tonight, so I'm going to go get it.

69
00:04:58,581 --> 00:05:00,203
[SPEAKER_04]: So somebody's got to fill time during this intro.

70
00:05:00,223 --> 00:05:01,724
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell the kids what they have to look forward to.

71
00:05:01,744 --> 00:05:04,046
[SPEAKER_14]: I had ice cream because I'm cheating like hell today.

72
00:05:04,647 --> 00:05:09,271
[SPEAKER_14]: I am having so much liquor that I'm probably going to end up in the hospital with blood poisoning.

73
00:05:10,012 --> 00:05:12,113
[SPEAKER_14]: As in, you know, too much blood in my alcohol level.

74
00:05:12,133 --> 00:05:19,335
[SPEAKER_04]: See, Rob had something rotten in his freezer, so all of his ice tastes really fucking nasty, so all my drinks are, like, not cold.

75
00:05:20,116 --> 00:05:20,916
[SPEAKER_14]: Wings of fish.

76
00:05:22,256 --> 00:05:22,756
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

77
00:05:22,876 --> 00:05:26,918
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, I smelled, I sniffed in there like, eugh, what is that?

78
00:05:27,418 --> 00:05:28,960
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I don't know, man.

79
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:37,770
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, even when our nasty freezer didn't smell that bad, but... I can't really get too shitfaced tonight, because I'm going to go drink at the club, too.

80
00:05:40,974 --> 00:05:43,456
[SPEAKER_14]: You also got me pineapple Malibu, but I have Guinness!

81
00:05:44,157 --> 00:05:45,379
[SPEAKER_14]: And a bottle opener!

82
00:05:46,744 --> 00:05:55,471
[SPEAKER_04]: I got Guinness, peppermint schnapps, Malibu pineapple rum, and there's also Smirnoff mandarin orange.

83
00:05:55,611 --> 00:05:57,212
[SPEAKER_18]: Do you have any normal Malibu?

84
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:04,018
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think there's any left, I hate to say it.

85
00:06:04,298 --> 00:06:05,078
[SPEAKER_04]: Guinness on sale!

86
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:08,281
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that the same bottle of Bacardi that's been sitting there for like weeks now?

87
00:06:09,642 --> 00:06:10,663
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably, I don't know.

88
00:06:12,164 --> 00:06:12,624
[SPEAKER_14]: Guinness!

89
00:06:13,265 --> 00:06:13,845
[SPEAKER_14]: Good batch!

90
00:06:15,086 --> 00:06:15,627
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, buzzy.

91
00:06:17,392 --> 00:06:19,173
[SPEAKER_13]: Looker, looker, looker.

92
00:06:19,233 --> 00:06:19,974
[SPEAKER_13]: I want a drink.

93
00:06:20,054 --> 00:06:21,975
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to screw the show.

94
00:06:21,995 --> 00:06:22,776
[SPEAKER_04]: Give me booze.

95
00:06:22,796 --> 00:06:24,697
[SPEAKER_04]: We will be back after this break.

96
00:06:25,858 --> 00:06:26,978
[SPEAKER_04]: What is wrong with that mic?

97
00:06:27,119 --> 00:06:28,800
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not drunk yet.

98
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,401
[SPEAKER_24]: It needs more alcohol.

99
00:06:30,421 --> 00:06:31,261
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to be dunked.

100
00:06:32,062 --> 00:06:33,002
[SPEAKER_04]: We will work on that.

101
00:06:34,303 --> 00:06:37,165
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course our alcohol show disclaimer when we come back after this.

102
00:06:37,866 --> 00:06:40,447
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not responsible for anything we say or do.

103
00:06:40,588 --> 00:06:41,888
[SPEAKER_04]: Or who we kill.

104
00:06:41,988 --> 00:06:42,569
[SPEAKER_04]: After this break.

105
00:06:42,609 --> 00:06:46,712
[SPEAKER_04]: In this break, some music that was popular when Orange Lounge Radio first started.

106
00:06:47,672 --> 00:06:53,257
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

107
00:07:13,328 --> 00:07:14,529
[SPEAKER_04]: At that point, you probably were.

108
00:07:14,569 --> 00:07:15,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

109
00:07:15,989 --> 00:07:18,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Up, down, up, down, choo, choo, choo.

110
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:21,892
[SPEAKER_04]: In this break, we're going to play some music from Max 2.

111
00:07:22,012 --> 00:07:24,353
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll start it off with Busta.

112
00:07:24,473 --> 00:07:26,514
[SPEAKER_04]: I will go find something to open that with.

113
00:07:26,754 --> 00:07:27,694
[SPEAKER_13]: Isn't it Twisty Off?

114
00:07:29,435 --> 00:07:29,995
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be back.

115
00:07:30,876 --> 00:07:31,836
[SPEAKER_13]: Not Twisty Off.

116
00:07:31,856 --> 00:07:35,718
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be back after this with more whining, courtesy of DarkSakura.

117
00:07:57,595 --> 00:07:58,956
The sound, it's coming out now

118
00:08:29,674 --> 00:08:36,040
[SPEAKER_15]: and I won't stop, like a pistol I keep on turning, like a fire I keep on burning, dance around in the place, and I'm a DJ right to place.

119
00:10:03,997 --> 00:10:05,199
Thanks for watching!

120
00:10:48,219 --> 00:10:49,381
Thanks for watching!

121
00:12:43,067 --> 00:12:43,848
Thank you.

122
00:13:46,308 --> 00:13:56,816
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, this is Jamie, you know me better as DarkSakura.

123
00:13:57,257 --> 00:14:04,562
[SPEAKER_11]: Please feel free to join us on June 23rd at 7pm for our first show of the Orange Lounge, the new Berlani Community Talk Show.

124
00:14:06,724 --> 00:14:08,265
[SPEAKER_11]: If you're not there, we'll hunt you down.

125
00:14:08,285 --> 00:14:09,306
[SPEAKER_11]: We know where you live.

126
00:14:09,366 --> 00:14:10,107
[SPEAKER_11]: We have your numbers.

127
00:14:10,147 --> 00:14:11,208
[SPEAKER_11]: We looked it up on the internet.

128
00:14:11,974 --> 00:14:13,816
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, we're back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

129
00:14:13,836 --> 00:14:14,676
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit of retro there.

130
00:14:15,097 --> 00:14:17,579
[SPEAKER_04]: That was one of the first commercials for Orange Lounge Radio we ran on here.

131
00:14:17,999 --> 00:14:20,261
[SPEAKER_04]: We are having a catastrophe here in studio.

132
00:14:20,301 --> 00:14:21,743
[SPEAKER_04]: This is horrible.

133
00:14:23,284 --> 00:14:27,488
[SPEAKER_04]: Nowhere in this apartment was there a bottle opener anywhere.

134
00:14:29,009 --> 00:14:30,570
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there screaming coming from the kitchen?

135
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:32,732
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but Jamie split a nail.

136
00:14:32,992 --> 00:14:36,075
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie split a nail trying to open a bottle of Guinness with a knife.

137
00:14:38,846 --> 00:14:44,651
[SPEAKER_04]: While I'm running around the house trying to find a lighter that I remember once having that had a bottle opener on the end of it.

138
00:14:45,011 --> 00:14:51,957
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is the first time that I'm going to regret quitting smoking because if I was still smoking, I'd probably still have that lighter on me.

139
00:14:53,878 --> 00:14:54,179
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well.

140
00:14:55,179 --> 00:15:06,329
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you feeling now that you finally get... Finally, by the way, Nelly, Loki's fiancee, ran downstairs and picked up a bottle opener from the neighbors, which would have been the smart thing to do in the first place, so...

141
00:15:08,089 --> 00:15:12,532
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura has a Guinness, Loki's on his second screwdriver.

142
00:15:13,733 --> 00:15:17,836
[SPEAKER_04]: I still have not drank in anything, so I've got to go get that Guinness that you opened up for me.

143
00:15:18,917 --> 00:15:19,537
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll be back.

144
00:15:19,557 --> 00:15:20,258
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys fill time.

145
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,241
[SPEAKER_14]: I like Guinness a whole bunch.

146
00:15:25,762 --> 00:15:26,222
[SPEAKER_14]: Yep, I do.

147
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:27,904
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?

148
00:15:29,365 --> 00:15:34,889
[SPEAKER_14]: It's better than that camel piss they sell, you know, Coors or whatever.

149
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:41,499
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

150
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:05,040
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been listening to show tunes in my car I got the Spamalot CD, the Money Python Broadway play

151
00:16:29,176 --> 00:16:31,298
[SPEAKER_04]: Night by the way, if you're looking for a quality show...

152
00:16:59,261 --> 00:17:02,242
[SPEAKER_04]: Our show is as good as those fireworks out there.

153
00:17:02,802 --> 00:17:07,304
[SPEAKER_04]: It started off great, but it kind of degrades after, you know, over time.

154
00:17:07,504 --> 00:17:09,785
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll open up the Skype line so you can give your congratulations.

155
00:17:09,805 --> 00:17:11,326
[SPEAKER_23]: We tone it down for your safety.

156
00:17:11,846 --> 00:17:12,346
[SPEAKER_14]: One down!

157
00:17:15,888 --> 00:17:17,669
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, good luck getting the next one open.

158
00:17:18,569 --> 00:17:19,389
[SPEAKER_14]: That's because I already opened it.

159
00:17:19,469 --> 00:17:19,809
[SPEAKER_14]: Aha!

160
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:21,390
[SPEAKER_04]: I took one that was already open.

161
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:22,130
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope you open three.

162
00:17:23,491 --> 00:17:23,691
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

163
00:17:25,137 --> 00:17:26,680
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, they gave us the bottle opener, it doesn't matter.

164
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:28,743
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no, the neighbors downstairs gave it to us.

165
00:17:29,164 --> 00:17:29,625
[SPEAKER_04]: They took it back.

166
00:17:31,789 --> 00:17:32,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, and they said, no, keep it.

167
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:37,382
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura's all excited.

168
00:17:37,722 --> 00:17:38,203
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, anyway.

169
00:17:38,863 --> 00:17:39,424
[SPEAKER_04]: How was your week?

170
00:17:39,464 --> 00:17:40,024
[SPEAKER_04]: How was your day?

171
00:17:40,064 --> 00:17:41,826
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll start off the show with the classic.

172
00:17:41,846 --> 00:17:44,928
[SPEAKER_04]: We weren't here last week, so we've got two weeks to catch up on.

173
00:17:44,948 --> 00:17:45,749
[SPEAKER_03]: What did they do last week?

174
00:17:45,769 --> 00:17:46,289
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wait, I'm sorry.

175
00:17:46,309 --> 00:17:47,510
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to do the drunk disclaimer.

176
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:48,130
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

177
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,572
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to start off the show with a drunk disclaimer.

178
00:17:49,912 --> 00:17:54,796
[SPEAKER_04]: Boys and girls, myself, Loki, and DarkSakura all indulging in a little bit of liquor tonight.

179
00:17:55,176 --> 00:17:58,959
[SPEAKER_04]: But please, if you are going to drink, drink responsibly, which we will be doing for the most part.

180
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,241
[SPEAKER_04]: And have a designated driver.

181
00:18:01,281 --> 00:18:02,862
[SPEAKER_04]: We do have several designated drivers tonight.

182
00:18:02,982 --> 00:18:04,123
[SPEAKER_04]: Extifer is remaining sober.

183
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:04,683
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

184
00:18:19,796 --> 00:18:21,256
[SPEAKER_04]: Blame it on Grand Theft Auto.

185
00:18:21,556 --> 00:18:22,717
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, blame it on Grand Theft Auto.

186
00:18:22,737 --> 00:18:23,217
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll believe that.

187
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:24,017
[SPEAKER_23]: Exactly.

188
00:18:24,097 --> 00:18:24,697
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, how was your week?

189
00:18:24,717 --> 00:18:25,057
[SPEAKER_04]: How was your day?

190
00:18:25,097 --> 00:18:26,158
[SPEAKER_23]: What was it?

191
00:18:26,198 --> 00:18:26,518
[SPEAKER_23]: My week?

192
00:18:26,938 --> 00:18:27,738
[SPEAKER_23]: What did I do last week?

193
00:18:27,938 --> 00:18:30,979
[SPEAKER_23]: I think I went down and met the rabbi.

194
00:18:31,219 --> 00:18:32,679
[SPEAKER_23]: I believe that was last week.

195
00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:35,260
[SPEAKER_23]: And we went down to San Francisco and that kind of sucked.

196
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:37,801
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, that's what we did last Sunday.

197
00:18:39,141 --> 00:18:46,683
[SPEAKER_23]: So we did that and that was kind of boring because, you know, San Francisco sucks and it was kind of cold and we went to the Cheesecake Factory and they have lean pizza there.

198
00:18:47,264 --> 00:18:48,124
[SPEAKER_23]: I picked up Destroy All Humans

199
00:19:00,758 --> 00:19:06,401
[SPEAKER_04]: and I actually beat that game today and what else?

200
00:19:06,862 --> 00:19:30,375
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I got another PSP as a spiff from my work so now I have two PSPs and I'm playing this game Dead to Rights Reckoning right now which is okay and no DDR at all because I have no computer to play it on my cabinet because my sister is borrowing my cabinet computer and that sucks.

201
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:31,079
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

202
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,323
[SPEAKER_04]: Because she needs a computer for school.

203
00:19:34,264 --> 00:19:37,349
[SPEAKER_04]: And I tried building her one out of the really shitty parts I had, and it didn't work.

204
00:19:40,474 --> 00:19:41,716
[SPEAKER_04]: Alas, she had to borrow it.

205
00:19:42,998 --> 00:19:45,602
[SPEAKER_04]: So my cabinet computer is gone for the summer.

206
00:19:47,634 --> 00:19:47,934
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh well.

207
00:19:48,015 --> 00:19:49,436
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not like you were using it anyway.

208
00:19:49,616 --> 00:19:50,517
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I used it once.

209
00:19:50,537 --> 00:19:54,462
[SPEAKER_04]: You built this huge main cabinet, it was a huge deal, and you spent how much money on this main cabinet?

210
00:19:54,682 --> 00:19:55,282
[SPEAKER_04]: About $3,000.

211
00:19:55,322 --> 00:19:57,425
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, thousands of dollars on this cabinet.

212
00:19:57,785 --> 00:20:00,788
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, I think I saw you play in the Simpsons arcade game once.

213
00:20:01,649 --> 00:20:03,031
[SPEAKER_23]: I used to play a lot more than that.

214
00:20:03,982 --> 00:20:09,725
[SPEAKER_23]: It's just, you know, what it comes down to right now is just I haven't been able to work on it lately.

215
00:20:09,925 --> 00:20:14,127
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, once I get more stuff in there, like a Beatmania controller or something, it'll be a lot more fun.

216
00:20:14,808 --> 00:20:27,555
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was playing DDR on it, but the problem is I have to still mod the pads to ground up static on them, and then it'll work, and then I can play DDR and get in shape and the whole plan and everything.

217
00:20:28,275 --> 00:20:31,777
[SPEAKER_04]: But right now, it's just, you know... Are you going to have a six-pack and all that stuff?

218
00:20:33,752 --> 00:20:35,233
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, how are you on number three already?

219
00:20:35,454 --> 00:20:36,755
[SPEAKER_04]: You drank number one in front of us.

220
00:20:36,995 --> 00:20:37,716
[SPEAKER_04]: Double shot of vodka.

221
00:20:39,337 --> 00:20:40,979
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, in that case, I'm on number four.

222
00:20:44,142 --> 00:20:46,965
[SPEAKER_14]: Double shots count as one beverage because it's in one glass.

223
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:49,027
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, then where did number two go?

224
00:20:49,067 --> 00:20:50,188
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm still on number one.

225
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:51,730
[SPEAKER_14]: I am on number three.

226
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:52,751
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, anyway.

227
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:53,812
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but where did number two go?

228
00:20:54,732 --> 00:20:55,954
[SPEAKER_14]: I did a double shot of vodka.

229
00:20:56,394 --> 00:20:58,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well, then what's this that you're drinking now?

230
00:20:59,282 --> 00:21:04,284
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, sugar-free cherry Jones Soda, and a double shot of vodka.

231
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:06,445
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.

232
00:21:07,586 --> 00:21:09,447
[SPEAKER_14]: I can drink vodka straight, thank you.

233
00:21:10,207 --> 00:21:11,448
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, uh, Mame Cabinet.

234
00:21:12,128 --> 00:21:14,549
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, yeah, so, Mame Cabinet and the computer are gone.

235
00:21:14,969 --> 00:21:15,289
[SPEAKER_04]: For now.

236
00:21:15,309 --> 00:21:16,990
[SPEAKER_04]: Because Mrs. Stresser has to do homework.

237
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,000
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

238
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,882
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really all I did this week, is just playing Destroy All Humans.

239
00:21:22,222 --> 00:21:29,126
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a lot of fun throwing people around using psychic abilities, especially with the ragdoll physics in that game.

240
00:21:29,446 --> 00:21:35,209
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes for a lot of fun, like you can pick up cows and smash them and stuff, and just people, and it's a lot of fun.

241
00:21:35,429 --> 00:21:35,969
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of fun.

242
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:40,872
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, so that's pretty much all I've been playing this week, and, um...

243
00:21:42,082 --> 00:21:43,142
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's pretty much it.

244
00:21:43,462 --> 00:21:45,763
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you went and saw the War of the Worlds, right?

245
00:21:46,003 --> 00:21:46,423
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

246
00:21:46,463 --> 00:21:47,023
[SPEAKER_04]: How was that?

247
00:21:47,423 --> 00:21:48,364
[SPEAKER_23]: That was good.

248
00:21:49,204 --> 00:21:50,904
[SPEAKER_06]: I have no interest in seeing War of the Worlds.

249
00:21:50,944 --> 00:21:51,525
[SPEAKER_06]: It was good.

250
00:21:51,885 --> 00:21:55,926
[SPEAKER_06]: I know I've been hearing it's really good, but I'm like, Tom Cruise is so 80s.

251
00:21:56,026 --> 00:21:57,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Who cares about Tom Cruise?

252
00:21:57,366 --> 00:21:58,987
[SPEAKER_13]: Tom Cruise isn't white.

253
00:21:59,027 --> 00:22:00,507
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't like Spielberg movies, either.

254
00:22:00,607 --> 00:22:01,167
[SPEAKER_04]: I really don't.

255
00:22:01,187 --> 00:22:03,828
[SPEAKER_13]: The only Spielberg movie I ever liked... Terminator 2 was fucking awesome!

256
00:22:03,848 --> 00:22:05,768
[SPEAKER_13]: That was not a Spielberg movie!

257
00:22:06,028 --> 00:22:06,349
Wasn't it?

258
00:22:06,389 --> 00:22:06,949
Yeah, it was.

259
00:22:06,969 --> 00:22:07,789
No, that was Cameron...

260
00:22:08,069 --> 00:22:10,750
[SPEAKER_07]: Steven Spielberg presents Terminator 2.

261
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:17,253
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think you can give Cameron because he's awesome.

262
00:22:17,593 --> 00:22:20,994
[SPEAKER_13]: Termy, can you help me save the world?

263
00:22:21,895 --> 00:22:23,115
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

264
00:22:23,255 --> 00:22:23,876
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

265
00:22:25,556 --> 00:22:27,537
[SPEAKER_07]: Terminator, phone home.

266
00:22:27,997 --> 00:22:28,838
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll be back.

267
00:22:29,078 --> 00:22:30,779
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't really want to hurt humans.

268
00:22:30,959 --> 00:22:32,939
[SPEAKER_07]: I just have to because I'm programmed this way.

269
00:22:32,959 --> 00:22:36,441
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you think that the Star Wars movies would have been better if Spielberg had a hand in them?

270
00:22:37,353 --> 00:22:39,914
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they couldn't have missed, because anything is better than Lucas.

271
00:22:40,735 --> 00:22:42,155
[SPEAKER_04]: Although, episode 3 was pretty cool.

272
00:22:42,275 --> 00:22:42,776
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give them that.

273
00:22:43,036 --> 00:22:45,617
[SPEAKER_14]: I saw George Lucas, and I almost looked at him.

274
00:22:45,897 --> 00:22:51,480
[SPEAKER_04]: First off, people, this is not, you know, this is not E- So take the fire up close.

275
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:51,860
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

276
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,481
[SPEAKER_04]: I am so hot.

277
00:22:54,561 --> 00:22:55,582
[SPEAKER_23]: This is not E.T.

278
00:22:55,642 --> 00:22:56,182
[SPEAKER_23]: Spielberg.

279
00:22:56,242 --> 00:22:58,083
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Dual Spielberg.

280
00:22:58,123 --> 00:23:00,064
[SPEAKER_04]: This is like Dark Spielberg, okay?

281
00:23:00,524 --> 00:23:01,685
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Evil Spielberg.

282
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:04,686
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, so, um- Do you know who I am?

283
00:23:04,706 --> 00:23:06,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have a tray?

284
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:09,596
[SPEAKER_13]: This is not a game.

285
00:23:09,636 --> 00:23:10,958
[SPEAKER_13]: Who the fuck are you?

286
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:15,223
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't even get that.

287
00:23:16,704 --> 00:23:17,205
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways.

288
00:23:19,407 --> 00:23:21,270
[SPEAKER_04]: I highly recommend going to see this movie.

289
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:22,311
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to see it again.

290
00:23:22,491 --> 00:23:23,352
[SPEAKER_04]: It was really good.

291
00:23:23,452 --> 00:23:25,154
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a movie that will stick with you.

292
00:23:25,214 --> 00:23:26,616
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like, you know, like, wow.

293
00:23:27,196 --> 00:23:28,458
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's one of those, you know.

294
00:23:28,772 --> 00:23:28,992
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura

295
00:23:49,187 --> 00:23:54,329
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the same thing about the Wicked Witch of the West How could she walk around fucking Oz?

296
00:24:12,017 --> 00:24:13,798
[SPEAKER_14]: When there's condensation in the air.

297
00:24:14,139 --> 00:24:17,061
[SPEAKER_04]: How do we know that Oz was based around a carbon base, you know?

298
00:24:17,301 --> 00:24:21,164
[SPEAKER_14]: Cause it was on fucking Earth and they could freakin' fly a balloon to Kansas!

299
00:24:22,536 --> 00:24:25,438
[SPEAKER_04]: And Batman Begins... Well, Oz is part of Hollywood, dammit!

300
00:24:25,619 --> 00:24:27,060
[SPEAKER_04]: Batman Begins, what the fuck?

301
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,140
[SPEAKER_04]: Our bodies are made of water.

302
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:28,981
[SPEAKER_04]: What the fuck was that?

303
00:24:29,281 --> 00:24:31,723
[SPEAKER_13]: I haven't seen a damn movie, so shut up.

304
00:24:31,763 --> 00:24:33,244
[SPEAKER_04]: If you saw the movie, what the fuck?

305
00:24:33,264 --> 00:24:34,064
[SPEAKER_04]: Our bodies are made of water.

306
00:24:34,085 --> 00:24:34,705
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good point.

307
00:24:34,725 --> 00:24:35,906
[SPEAKER_04]: People would explode.

308
00:24:36,246 --> 00:24:37,347
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have liked that better.

309
00:24:39,368 --> 00:24:42,931
[SPEAKER_04]: I liked Batman Begins because it had the setup of one of the 60s Batmans.

310
00:24:43,351 --> 00:25:04,516
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, you know, that's been great, like, you know, like, they have this great plan and stuff, you know, the vaporized water and whatnot, and then people start explaining, they're all, well, that's an unseen, that's an unseen side effect, but okay, hey, I'm going with it, you know, poison people, make them explode, whatever, hey, as long as, the same, you know, consequence.

311
00:25:07,419 --> 00:25:09,082
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, by the way.

312
00:25:22,102 --> 00:25:23,802
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been playing a game non-stop all week, too.

313
00:25:23,842 --> 00:25:25,843
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know whether to talk about it now or on the podcast.

314
00:25:25,863 --> 00:25:31,484
[SPEAKER_04]: And by the way, usually we tape our podcasts right after the show, so I'm kind of worried about tonight's podcast.

315
00:25:31,544 --> 00:25:32,144
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, who cares?

316
00:25:33,605 --> 00:25:33,985
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

317
00:25:34,525 --> 00:25:37,346
[SPEAKER_23]: But anyways, yeah, Destroy All Humans, awesome game.

318
00:25:37,406 --> 00:25:37,926
[SPEAKER_23]: It's a lot of fun.

319
00:25:37,986 --> 00:25:47,868
[SPEAKER_04]: What's great about it, though, is one of the main Martian or Furon, the alien race or whatever, is voiced by the guy that does Invader Zim.

320
00:25:48,308 --> 00:25:49,329
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's Zim.

321
00:25:49,869 --> 00:25:52,411
[SPEAKER_04]: The game is basically Invader Zim the game.

322
00:25:52,531 --> 00:25:53,471
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just awesome.

323
00:25:53,491 --> 00:25:58,314
[SPEAKER_04]: And they've got some other voice actors from other cartoons out there.

324
00:25:58,334 --> 00:26:06,259
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's a guy from King of the Hill and some other ones I recognized but I wasn't positive because I don't remember voice actor names.

325
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:09,061
[SPEAKER_04]: But Invader Zim guy, I was like, oh!

326
00:26:10,382 --> 00:26:10,642
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura

327
00:26:36,563 --> 00:26:45,930
[SPEAKER_14]: I spent all week moving my shit from my apartment, which sucks a whole bunch of ass.

328
00:26:46,391 --> 00:26:50,274
[SPEAKER_14]: It sucks an ass larger than that of Roseanne Barr at her biggest.

329
00:26:52,015 --> 00:26:54,817
[SPEAKER_04]: Or Rosie O'Donnell at current.

330
00:26:54,897 --> 00:26:55,918
[SPEAKER_14]: God, that one was chunky.

331
00:26:57,759 --> 00:27:01,120
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, I've moved all this stuff from the apartment.

332
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:01,861
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, Dan and I did.

333
00:27:01,881 --> 00:27:02,761
[SPEAKER_14]: It took two days off.

334
00:27:03,041 --> 00:27:04,542
[SPEAKER_14]: And we got all this stuff from our apartment.

335
00:27:05,002 --> 00:27:08,063
[SPEAKER_14]: And he says it's like a really twisted Christmas.

336
00:27:09,003 --> 00:27:14,726
[SPEAKER_14]: Where you're opening all these presents that's full of your own shit and you don't know what's in what box.

337
00:27:15,926 --> 00:27:17,647
[SPEAKER_14]: I've got the kitchen mostly unpacked.

338
00:27:19,527 --> 00:27:20,148
[SPEAKER_14]: And, um...

339
00:27:21,658 --> 00:27:24,120
[SPEAKER_14]: Then working on that today and yesterday for a bit.

340
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,460
[SPEAKER_14]: And then we got our refrigerator.

341
00:27:26,201 --> 00:27:27,162
[SPEAKER_14]: We got our washer and dryer.

342
00:27:27,202 --> 00:27:28,562
[SPEAKER_14]: We spent over $2,700 for that trip.

343
00:27:28,623 --> 00:27:29,763
[SPEAKER_24]: So you're in a house now?

344
00:27:30,224 --> 00:27:30,804
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm in a house.

345
00:27:31,204 --> 00:27:31,444
[SPEAKER_14]: Awesome.

346
00:27:31,464 --> 00:27:32,785
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to be living there for some time.

347
00:27:33,246 --> 00:27:42,331
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm thinking that we might even move studio maybe if everyone's not supposed to because I live in Citrus Heights instead of Rancho Cambodia.

348
00:27:46,214 --> 00:27:46,854
[SPEAKER_14]: That happened too.

349
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:48,460
[SPEAKER_24]: Really?

350
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:49,100
[SPEAKER_24]: You don't say.

351
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:51,941
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm having very juicy burps, and I don't know why.

352
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:53,002
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

353
00:27:54,342 --> 00:27:56,743
[SPEAKER_14]: Dan's supposed to be here any moment now with my pants.

354
00:27:57,743 --> 00:28:02,905
[SPEAKER_14]: And I've got to go downstairs and pretend to be sober.

355
00:28:03,405 --> 00:28:04,706
[SPEAKER_14]: And make it down the stairs.

356
00:28:04,726 --> 00:28:05,646
[SPEAKER_14]: That's going to be fun.

357
00:28:06,446 --> 00:28:07,447
[SPEAKER_14]: Just slide down the rail.

358
00:28:08,367 --> 00:28:13,249
[SPEAKER_14]: We got a 50-inch freaking HD widescreen projection TV.

359
00:28:14,884 --> 00:28:17,292
[SPEAKER_14]: And this thing is huge.

360
00:28:17,312 --> 00:28:20,704
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a very big TV.

361
00:28:20,764 --> 00:28:21,848
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it 50 inch huge?

362
00:28:23,186 --> 00:28:24,687
[SPEAKER_14]: It is very satisfying.

363
00:28:26,168 --> 00:28:27,288
[SPEAKER_14]: I could do that.

364
00:28:27,728 --> 00:28:28,789
[SPEAKER_14]: I could ride that thing all night.

365
00:28:29,649 --> 00:28:30,070
[SPEAKER_14]: Or watch it.

366
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:30,950
[SPEAKER_23]: You could ride.

367
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:33,771
[SPEAKER_23]: She's gonna ride the TV all night long.

368
00:28:33,791 --> 00:28:35,132
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you hear that?

369
00:28:35,232 --> 00:28:37,713
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to mix it onto the TV.

370
00:28:37,994 --> 00:28:44,577
[SPEAKER_04]: For those of you keeping drink counts at home, I'm now drinking four shots of Malibu Pineapple mixed with 7-Up.

371
00:28:45,958 --> 00:28:47,798
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have my DDR ice in there.

372
00:28:47,818 --> 00:28:48,399
[SPEAKER_04]: Taste!

373
00:28:49,079 --> 00:28:51,420
[SPEAKER_04]: I found ice trays at Ikea that are arrows.

374
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,021
[SPEAKER_04]: Does the ice taste like fish?

375
00:28:54,121 --> 00:28:54,321
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

376
00:28:54,461 --> 00:28:55,761
[SPEAKER_04]: The drink is hella good, by the way.

377
00:28:56,961 --> 00:28:58,842
[SPEAKER_04]: So the ice is kosher?

378
00:28:59,002 --> 00:28:59,782
[SPEAKER_04]: The ice is kosher.

379
00:29:00,282 --> 00:29:03,443
[SPEAKER_14]: I found out that I'm not as big of a rum fan as I once was.

380
00:29:03,623 --> 00:29:07,605
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm going to go start on shot 5 and 6, I think.

381
00:29:08,805 --> 00:29:14,747
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, this is shot 4, but I have had Guinness as well, and I'm going to have Guinness next.

382
00:29:14,767 --> 00:29:15,927
[SPEAKER_23]: We'll count that as a shot, I guess.

383
00:29:16,451 --> 00:29:26,782
[SPEAKER_23]: because I'm going by like, you know, how they count drinks, you know, as a shot of alcohol is a drink and beer is a drink and whatever else is, a glass of wine I guess is a drink, so.

384
00:29:28,106 --> 00:29:34,271
[SPEAKER_14]: This will be... But I'm really, really... I'm gonna take it easy on the show because I'm gonna be at the club tonight.

385
00:29:34,551 --> 00:29:36,892
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we're going to the club later.

386
00:29:36,912 --> 00:29:38,374
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you guys are going to the club.

387
00:29:38,474 --> 00:29:39,254
[SPEAKER_04]: I ain't going nowhere.

388
00:29:39,274 --> 00:29:43,097
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you think that he would take us by the ATM so I can drink my... Probably.

389
00:29:43,137 --> 00:29:44,458
[SPEAKER_04]: We can talk Xtifer into it.

390
00:29:44,698 --> 00:29:45,159
[SPEAKER_14]: Yay!

391
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:46,560
[SPEAKER_04]: Xtifer's in a good mood.

392
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:47,280
[SPEAKER_04]: He met his crush.

393
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:47,840
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

394
00:29:48,701 --> 00:29:50,123
[SPEAKER_14]: I need to meet his crush next.

395
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:52,245
[SPEAKER_14]: I need to go down and give him a drunken thank you.

396
00:29:53,326 --> 00:29:55,568
[SPEAKER_14]: And I need to hear his, like, hot British accent.

397
00:29:55,748 --> 00:29:58,691
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, I missed your week and your day, but I'm sure it was good.

398
00:29:59,071 --> 00:30:00,052
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it wasn't!

399
00:30:00,533 --> 00:30:01,133
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, not today.

400
00:30:01,173 --> 00:30:02,074
[SPEAKER_04]: Your day wasn't good.

401
00:30:02,615 --> 00:30:04,637
[SPEAKER_13]: My week was spent with boxes!

402
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:17,955
[SPEAKER_14]: I sleep surrounded by dirty laundry, because all of our laundry is dirty and we haven't had a washing machine, which we just got today, and guess what I get to do on the 4th of July?

403
00:30:18,535 --> 00:30:18,915
[SPEAKER_14]: Laundry?

404
00:30:18,935 --> 00:30:20,096
[SPEAKER_13]: Fucking laundry!

405
00:30:20,876 --> 00:30:23,317
[SPEAKER_13]: I have neighbors, people.

406
00:30:23,978 --> 00:30:28,480
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry for your neighbors, but I have lots of laundry-related eggs.

407
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:31,641
[SPEAKER_04]: We realize what happens when they give us a can opener.

408
00:30:32,361 --> 00:30:33,822
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on, or a bottle opener.

409
00:30:33,942 --> 00:30:35,823
[SPEAKER_13]: We like you sexy British men.

410
00:30:38,032 --> 00:30:38,592
[SPEAKER_04]: Jesus.

411
00:30:38,832 --> 00:30:40,533
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't love the sexy British man.

412
00:30:40,573 --> 00:30:40,933
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

413
00:30:41,333 --> 00:30:42,033
[SPEAKER_13]: That's okay.

414
00:30:42,393 --> 00:30:43,593
[SPEAKER_13]: I will love him for you.

415
00:30:43,613 --> 00:30:45,473
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

416
00:30:46,794 --> 00:30:47,574
[SPEAKER_04]: Alrighty then.

417
00:30:48,234 --> 00:30:49,314
[SPEAKER_14]: I love my Dan.

418
00:30:50,394 --> 00:30:55,816
[SPEAKER_14]: Because he understands that every so often, if I don't have liquor, I'll shrivel up and die.

419
00:30:56,556 --> 00:30:59,436
[SPEAKER_04]: I think if we get a TV show, I'm going to always do it drunk.

420
00:31:01,977 --> 00:31:07,398
[SPEAKER_14]: You're going to sit back and be like, I'm Loki and I'm angry and drunk.

421
00:31:08,965 --> 00:31:19,950
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to be wearing one of those leisure suits, not necessarily a leisure suit, but something like Hugh Hefner would be wearing, like a bathrobe and slippers, and be sitting there with a martini.

422
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:24,211
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of those hosts on G4 have to be drunk to get through.

423
00:31:25,072 --> 00:31:28,873
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't you know that everyone in Hollywood is either drunk or on drugs?

424
00:31:29,654 --> 00:31:30,474
[SPEAKER_14]: Or roller skates.

425
00:31:31,346 --> 00:31:40,787
[SPEAKER_13]: LOLerskates LOLerskates LOLerskates LOLerskates LOLerskates LOLerskates LOLerskates LOLerskates LOLerskates LOLerskates LOLerskates LOLerskates

426
00:31:41,275 --> 00:31:41,755
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, God.

427
00:31:41,775 --> 00:31:43,217
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what, Rob?

428
00:31:43,677 --> 00:31:45,678
[SPEAKER_14]: That can has been on your desk for a year.

429
00:31:46,019 --> 00:31:46,459
[SPEAKER_04]: Chatroom?

430
00:31:46,499 --> 00:31:46,899
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it hasn't.

431
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:54,025
[SPEAKER_04]: Chatroom, they said I only had four drinks, but that is one Guinness and four shots.

432
00:31:54,125 --> 00:31:56,186
[SPEAKER_14]: We're even right now, Chatroom.

433
00:31:56,207 --> 00:31:58,088
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going by government drinks, okay?

434
00:31:58,228 --> 00:32:01,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Technically, this would be a second drink if I were counting actual drinks.

435
00:32:02,812 --> 00:32:07,395
[SPEAKER_14]: By actual drink numbers, Rob has had two, Loki has had two, I have had three.

436
00:32:08,336 --> 00:32:09,096
[SPEAKER_14]: By shot.

437
00:32:09,537 --> 00:32:09,737
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

438
00:32:10,526 --> 00:32:12,067
[SPEAKER_14]: We are all dead tied at five.

439
00:32:12,567 --> 00:32:13,507
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm at four.

440
00:32:13,587 --> 00:32:17,309
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to be starting five in just a second here as soon as I finish the last bit of my drink.

441
00:32:18,409 --> 00:32:25,753
[SPEAKER_14]: And I apologize for belching, but I'm having soda with my vodka right now, which I... You all know that I am a belch monster already.

442
00:32:26,833 --> 00:32:30,255
[SPEAKER_14]: That is my one highly unfeminine trait.

443
00:32:30,415 --> 00:32:33,156
[SPEAKER_04]: Excuse me while I take a brief recess to get some more alcohol.

444
00:32:33,736 --> 00:32:39,699
[SPEAKER_14]: I also have other unfeminine traits like climbing trees and shooting people with guns and driving a tank.

445
00:32:41,613 --> 00:32:43,354
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the adventures of LOL!

446
00:32:44,655 --> 00:32:47,516
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh my god!

447
00:32:47,656 --> 00:32:48,997
[SPEAKER_13]: I could do a webcomic of that!

448
00:32:49,797 --> 00:32:51,258
[SPEAKER_13]: Wouldn't that be fucking funny?

449
00:32:51,278 --> 00:32:51,338
[SPEAKER_13]: LOL!

450
00:32:51,518 --> 00:32:53,319
[SPEAKER_13]: You're gonna do a webcomic LOL!

451
00:32:53,479 --> 00:32:53,839
[SPEAKER_13]: LOL!

452
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,180
[SPEAKER_13]: Burb!

453
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:57,401
[SPEAKER_13]: You're a burb!

454
00:32:57,721 --> 00:32:59,382
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki, you're a burb!

455
00:32:59,702 --> 00:33:00,302
[SPEAKER_14]: Burb!

456
00:33:00,382 --> 00:33:00,802
[SPEAKER_14]: Burb!

457
00:33:01,122 --> 00:33:01,483
[SPEAKER_14]: Burb!

458
00:33:01,823 --> 00:33:02,283
[SPEAKER_14]: Burb!

459
00:33:03,363 --> 00:33:07,545
[SPEAKER_14]: No, seriously, I'm gonna do the Orange Sounds webcomic, but I need someone who does Flash.

460
00:33:08,206 --> 00:33:10,767
[SPEAKER_14]: Cause we need to have our fictional studio online.

461
00:33:11,684 --> 00:33:14,810
[SPEAKER_14]: where everyone can explore and interact with us.

462
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:20,621
[SPEAKER_14]: Rob, I have an observation for you.

463
00:33:20,661 --> 00:33:21,864
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a very obvious one.

464
00:33:21,904 --> 00:33:22,304
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that?

465
00:33:23,916 --> 00:33:25,436
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, I'm trying my best.

466
00:33:25,557 --> 00:33:26,457
[SPEAKER_04]: It's because you're drinking.

467
00:33:26,497 --> 00:33:27,537
[SPEAKER_04]: You're getting hot from drinking.

468
00:33:27,617 --> 00:33:28,618
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just hot anyway.

469
00:33:29,938 --> 00:33:30,758
[SPEAKER_04]: We know, we know.

470
00:33:31,819 --> 00:33:33,939
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, my week and my day.

471
00:33:33,999 --> 00:33:36,520
[SPEAKER_14]: My mutant ability is not belching.

472
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,921
[SPEAKER_14]: It's staring at traffic like, no!

473
00:33:38,941 --> 00:33:41,582
[SPEAKER_14]: Who is the diva of the show?

474
00:33:41,662 --> 00:33:43,122
[SPEAKER_14]: I do not believe that it is you.

475
00:33:43,142 --> 00:33:47,043
[SPEAKER_13]: I am an internet fucking celebrity.

476
00:33:48,764 --> 00:33:51,845
[SPEAKER_14]: I am not a celebrity who fucks the internet, except for screwing it over.

477
00:33:52,808 --> 00:33:54,029
[SPEAKER_14]: I am an internet celebrity.

478
00:33:54,569 --> 00:33:56,130
[SPEAKER_14]: That makes me the diva of the show.

479
00:33:57,191 --> 00:33:57,491
[SPEAKER_14]: Hello?

480
00:33:58,272 --> 00:34:00,053
[SPEAKER_14]: My power cable just fell out of my lap.

481
00:34:00,073 --> 00:34:01,274
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm an internet celebrity too.

482
00:34:01,314 --> 00:34:02,394
[SPEAKER_04]: I have like 140 friends on Myspace.

483
00:34:02,414 --> 00:34:03,935
[SPEAKER_14]: I have to plug myself in again.

484
00:34:04,556 --> 00:34:09,819
[SPEAKER_14]: I joined Myspace a month ago and I have 42 people, including Corey Feldman.

485
00:34:11,981 --> 00:34:13,302
[SPEAKER_14]: Corey Feldman is my buddy.

486
00:34:15,731 --> 00:34:18,952
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to make a MySpace profile for Adventures of LoL.

487
00:34:19,513 --> 00:34:20,153
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

488
00:34:20,633 --> 00:34:23,054
[SPEAKER_14]: I made an Orange Zones one, but I haven't done shit with it yet.

489
00:34:23,194 --> 00:34:24,214
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not in heat, shut up!

490
00:34:26,155 --> 00:34:27,716
[SPEAKER_14]: If I were in heat, you would know.

491
00:34:27,996 --> 00:34:30,317
[SPEAKER_14]: Because if it wouldn't be you, I would be Heat Matt.

492
00:34:32,037 --> 00:34:32,398
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

493
00:34:32,838 --> 00:34:34,138
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you finished so I can talk about my week?

494
00:34:34,158 --> 00:34:34,959
[SPEAKER_04]: Because my week sucked.

495
00:34:35,099 --> 00:34:35,579
[SPEAKER_14]: Fuck your week.

496
00:34:36,687 --> 00:34:42,310
[SPEAKER_04]: I give you permission to speak, oh Rob, who sits by the computer, with your legs all crossed, you need a cigarette now, you are so like...

497
00:34:54,018 --> 00:34:59,686
[SPEAKER_04]: You were the most supportive of me stopping smoking, and now you're like, you want a cigar tonight?

498
00:34:59,726 --> 00:35:02,409
[SPEAKER_14]: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

499
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:07,917
[SPEAKER_14]: I do not believe in cigarettes, because cigarettes are very addicting.

500
00:35:08,377 --> 00:35:10,418
[SPEAKER_04]: I do have my secret hidden stash.

501
00:35:11,058 --> 00:35:14,319
[SPEAKER_14]: Claims I'm fine with, because you best be hooking me up with that.

502
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:25,084
[SPEAKER_14]: I have found out from my fiance, he's not really happy about it, but he is okay with me having a cigar every so often.

503
00:35:25,704 --> 00:35:29,345
[SPEAKER_14]: So I picked up a pack of Black Milds, because they're pipe tobacco.

504
00:35:29,425 --> 00:35:29,605
[SPEAKER_14]: Nope.

505
00:35:30,005 --> 00:35:31,446
[SPEAKER_14]: And pipe tobacco is sexy.

506
00:35:31,506 --> 00:35:33,367
[SPEAKER_04]: We really don't endorse smoking, boys and girls.

507
00:35:33,407 --> 00:35:33,827
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't start.

508
00:35:33,847 --> 00:35:34,047
[SPEAKER_04]: Select!

509
00:35:35,728 --> 00:35:36,689
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't start, kids.

510
00:35:36,989 --> 00:35:37,849
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a nasty habit.

511
00:35:38,149 --> 00:35:42,932
[SPEAKER_14]: It is a nasty habit, and if you have your lungs full of tar, we'll laugh at you when you croak.

512
00:35:44,373 --> 00:35:45,553
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, tell us about your week, Rob.

513
00:35:45,593 --> 00:35:46,714
[SPEAKER_14]: I bet it was fascinating.

514
00:35:46,814 --> 00:35:49,956
[SPEAKER_04]: No, my car was broken into for the second time this week.

515
00:35:50,096 --> 00:35:51,116
[SPEAKER_04]: You should move.

516
00:35:51,177 --> 00:35:55,739
[SPEAKER_04]: This time they smashed a window, and they took my new stereo that the insurance company had replaced.

517
00:35:56,199 --> 00:35:58,861
[SPEAKER_04]: They dug through my car until they found my faceplate.

518
00:35:58,901 --> 00:36:04,664
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, okay, stupid me for keeping my faceplate in my car, but I had it in a secret spot where I didn't think anyone would find it.

519
00:36:06,036 --> 00:36:08,198
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll get the fan in a little bit so it cools off in here.

520
00:36:08,698 --> 00:36:09,379
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, hold on.

521
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:12,020
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm giving Jamie some competition.

522
00:36:12,281 --> 00:36:13,782
[SPEAKER_14]: You're red in the face, Loki.

523
00:36:13,922 --> 00:36:15,162
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fine in here.

524
00:36:15,183 --> 00:36:16,163
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki, you're red.

525
00:36:16,744 --> 00:36:18,545
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to give you my Zim doll.

526
00:36:20,146 --> 00:36:21,667
[SPEAKER_14]: I have a big plushie Zim pillow.

527
00:36:22,387 --> 00:36:24,329
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do I have a big plushie girl pillow?

528
00:36:24,369 --> 00:36:26,030
[SPEAKER_04]: Our chatroom is www.org.com.

529
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:27,371
[SPEAKER_04]: Why is the chatroom saying our stream dropped?

530
00:36:27,391 --> 00:36:27,931
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we're still up.

531
00:36:28,051 --> 00:36:28,651
[SPEAKER_04]: We always have it up.

532
00:36:34,975 --> 00:36:35,756
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm always up.

533
00:36:37,797 --> 00:36:40,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't make me waste my vodka by spitting it on your face.

534
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:42,840
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even want to discuss stuff like that.

535
00:36:44,682 --> 00:36:45,923
[SPEAKER_04]: Just because, yeah.

536
00:36:46,183 --> 00:36:46,883
[SPEAKER_04]: What happened?

537
00:36:48,444 --> 00:36:49,865
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's not what happened.

538
00:36:51,166 --> 00:36:55,989
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not going to go there because that's a little, you know, beyond the show format here, okay?

539
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:59,132
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not, you know, let's talk about Loki's sex life.

540
00:36:59,192 --> 00:37:00,573
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not a bad thing either.

541
00:37:00,633 --> 00:37:02,554
[SPEAKER_04]: It's good stuff, but, you know, it's just,

542
00:37:04,017 --> 00:37:06,399
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a side effect to having a cold.

543
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:08,481
[SPEAKER_04]: I get a weird side effect.

544
00:37:09,542 --> 00:37:11,665
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, it's just odd.

545
00:37:13,146 --> 00:37:14,548
[SPEAKER_24]: We're not going to talk about it, okay?

546
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:17,871
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know what he's laughing about.

547
00:37:17,891 --> 00:37:19,333
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we get Nelly in here to clarify?

548
00:37:19,353 --> 00:37:19,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

549
00:37:20,885 --> 00:37:22,948
[SPEAKER_04]: I can tell you what it is, but I'm not sure.

550
00:37:22,968 --> 00:37:24,390
[SPEAKER_14]: I have a replacement for Dunk.

551
00:37:24,591 --> 00:37:25,652
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think the listeners want to hear it.

552
00:37:25,672 --> 00:37:26,393
[SPEAKER_14]: It's in the chat room.

553
00:37:26,413 --> 00:37:27,455
[SPEAKER_14]: I have a replacement for Dunk.

554
00:37:27,876 --> 00:37:28,316
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that?

555
00:37:28,677 --> 00:37:28,997
[SPEAKER_14]: Dirk.

556
00:37:29,618 --> 00:37:29,939
[SPEAKER_04]: Dirk?

557
00:37:30,459 --> 00:37:30,760
[SPEAKER_04]: Dirk?

558
00:37:31,361 --> 00:37:31,661
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

559
00:37:32,062 --> 00:37:33,023
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, um...

560
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:35,320
[SPEAKER_04]: What was it?

561
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:36,340
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my car got broken into.

562
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:40,502
[SPEAKER_04]: And this time, instead of just prying open the door, they actually smashed one of my windows.

563
00:37:40,802 --> 00:37:44,123
[SPEAKER_04]: And the insurance company won't replace my broken window until a week from today.

564
00:37:44,803 --> 00:37:45,563
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't that stupid?

565
00:37:45,843 --> 00:37:46,723
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm driving around.

566
00:37:47,023 --> 00:37:53,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and to add insult to injury, they fucked up my lock on the driver's side, so I can't even open my driver door.

567
00:37:53,345 --> 00:38:00,167
[SPEAKER_04]: So I get into my car, I have to open up the passenger door, climb my fat ass across the seat, and then I get to sit down.

568
00:38:00,587 --> 00:38:01,368
[SPEAKER_04]: Sucks.

569
00:38:01,408 --> 00:38:04,069
[SPEAKER_04]: Did they fuck up the lock on the outside or the lock all together?

570
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:06,911
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't open the door from the inside.

571
00:38:06,931 --> 00:38:11,654
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, because my old car used to have to pop open the door on the passenger side, unlock the door, and then walk around.

572
00:38:11,754 --> 00:38:12,634
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it won't even work.

573
00:38:13,274 --> 00:38:17,797
[SPEAKER_04]: Because some dumbass tried to open the lock with a screwdriver and that didn't work.

574
00:38:17,817 --> 00:38:20,759
[SPEAKER_04]: My door won't even open from the... I don't even know how they're going to fix it.

575
00:38:20,899 --> 00:38:21,459
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be incredible.

576
00:38:21,779 --> 00:38:22,460
[SPEAKER_23]: But it's great, though.

577
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:25,462
[SPEAKER_23]: See, my old car, they were trying to steal the stock stereo.

578
00:38:25,502 --> 00:38:27,523
[SPEAKER_14]: I have to tell something to Illusion real quick.

579
00:38:27,683 --> 00:38:27,923
[SPEAKER_14]: What?

580
00:38:28,623 --> 00:38:29,064
[SPEAKER_16]: What?

581
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:35,720
[SPEAKER_23]: I saw that movie, it's great.

582
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:36,620
[SPEAKER_23]: Here's my ferret impersonation.

583
00:39:03,959 --> 00:39:04,799
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so that was my week.

584
00:39:04,839 --> 00:39:05,739
[SPEAKER_04]: My car got broken into.

585
00:39:05,759 --> 00:39:05,980
[SPEAKER_04]: That sucks.

586
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,400
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not an impersonation.

587
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:08,620
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut up!

588
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:12,201
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll talk about this more on the podcast if I can, if I'm not too insanely drunk.

589
00:39:12,501 --> 00:39:14,802
[SPEAKER_04]: But I was playing Meteos all week.

590
00:39:14,842 --> 00:39:15,602
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you finally got that?

591
00:39:15,782 --> 00:39:17,262
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it just came out this past week.

592
00:39:17,282 --> 00:39:17,642
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I know.

593
00:39:18,242 --> 00:39:18,923
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so hot.

594
00:39:19,083 --> 00:39:19,443
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.

595
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:22,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Meteos is like the reason why there's a DS.

596
00:39:22,964 --> 00:39:24,464
[SPEAKER_04]: Meteos makes... I'm gonna...

597
00:39:26,118 --> 00:39:27,239
[SPEAKER_04]: Shove that thing up your ass.

598
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:31,682
[SPEAKER_04]: Meteos is the reason why they made a DS, seriously.

599
00:39:32,343 --> 00:39:35,585
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything good about the DS technology is used in Meteos.

600
00:39:35,666 --> 00:39:36,026
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.

601
00:39:36,786 --> 00:39:38,548
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to make sweet love to it and have its babies.

602
00:39:40,749 --> 00:39:42,891
[SPEAKER_04]: And those babies will be Nintendogs.

603
00:39:43,692 --> 00:39:45,093
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, hey, Illusion, guess what?

604
00:39:49,798 --> 00:39:56,000
[SPEAKER_04]: If I could stab this microphone to my brain, I'd do it right now, but since that's impossible.

605
00:39:56,300 --> 00:40:02,463
[SPEAKER_04]: To answer a question in chat room, somebody's saying that in response to my car getting broken into, they said, that's what insurance is for.

606
00:40:02,843 --> 00:40:09,025
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, well, I still have a $100 deductible, which sucks, and they'll probably jack up my rates because it's the second time my car's been broken into.

607
00:40:09,045 --> 00:40:11,926
[SPEAKER_14]: This is because you moved into Rancho Cambodia.

608
00:40:14,387 --> 00:40:17,888
[SPEAKER_14]: I swear, like, they're trying to...

609
00:40:20,755 --> 00:40:26,520
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

610
00:40:42,961 --> 00:40:44,182
[SPEAKER_14]: I like you, chat room person.

611
00:40:44,482 --> 00:40:45,103
[SPEAKER_04]: That was Misty.

612
00:40:45,703 --> 00:40:47,365
[SPEAKER_04]: Misty, you were awesome.

613
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:49,126
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got music with me.

614
00:40:49,327 --> 00:40:50,287
[SPEAKER_04]: Because this is a segue.

615
00:40:50,628 --> 00:40:51,348
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a good segue.

616
00:40:51,408 --> 00:40:53,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we're going to talk about Akira Yamaoka when we come back, if we can.

617
00:40:54,131 --> 00:40:55,692
[SPEAKER_04]: I need Kutima DXY.

618
00:40:56,593 --> 00:40:57,534
[SPEAKER_04]: If I can find it.

619
00:40:57,794 --> 00:40:58,394
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do it again.

620
00:40:58,434 --> 00:40:58,695
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

621
00:40:59,175 --> 00:41:01,857
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, this song's like four minutes, or five minutes, so we're going to play it.

622
00:41:01,877 --> 00:41:03,359
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to come back and talk about Akira.

623
00:41:03,519 --> 00:41:04,420
[SPEAKER_14]: Do that and then play...

624
00:41:07,262 --> 00:41:08,263
[SPEAKER_14]: What's that other one?

625
00:41:09,443 --> 00:41:10,964
[SPEAKER_14]: The one that's named after a Beatles song.

626
00:41:11,004 --> 00:41:11,564
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me do it.

627
00:41:12,005 --> 00:41:12,665
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll see what we can do.

628
00:41:12,705 --> 00:41:12,965
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

629
00:41:13,345 --> 00:41:16,207
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll get some music, and then we'll be back with more Orange Launcher.

630
00:41:16,227 --> 00:41:17,547
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're going to open up the Skype line.

631
00:41:17,587 --> 00:41:22,650
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you guys want to talk to us in our, what's the word?

632
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:24,031
[SPEAKER_04]: Drunken state?

633
00:41:24,051 --> 00:41:24,311
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess.

634
00:41:24,391 --> 00:41:26,172
[SPEAKER_04]: Drunken, inebriated, I don't know, state.

635
00:41:26,512 --> 00:41:27,833
[SPEAKER_04]: You will have the opportunity when we come back.

636
00:41:27,853 --> 00:41:29,954
[SPEAKER_04]: Go to orangelauncher.com and interact with us.

637
00:41:30,994 --> 00:41:31,815
[SPEAKER_03]: They said I looked pink.

638
00:41:32,571 --> 00:41:32,992
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

639
00:41:33,112 --> 00:41:34,295
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, we'll be back after this.

640
00:41:34,636 --> 00:41:37,884
[SPEAKER_04]: Your Rain, the Rage Mix from Akira Yamaoka, because we're going to talk about him when we come back.

641
00:41:38,907 --> 00:41:39,368
[SPEAKER_03]: Akira.

642
00:41:39,408 --> 00:41:40,230
[SPEAKER_04]: And how hot he is.

643
00:41:40,591 --> 00:41:41,052
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be back.

644
00:41:41,253 --> 00:41:41,734
[SPEAKER_04]: Okie dokie.

645
00:43:14,392 --> 00:43:15,193
Thanks for watching!

646
00:43:51,616 --> 00:44:05,441
I'm a sidewalk, I'm a city, I'm a creature, I'm a whisper Is it people, or are we nowhere?

647
00:44:05,461 --> 00:44:07,201
[SPEAKER_16]: There is no glory, no compassion

648
00:44:48,451 --> 00:44:55,297
[SPEAKER_16]: Out of my head, and I don't know where to go Over and over, I feel the break with God

649
00:45:27,074 --> 00:45:33,682
On the sidewalk of the city, on the streets of the river, there's a people going nowhere, see me talking all right.

650
00:45:33,702 --> 00:45:39,169
There's a passion, there's a matter, my resistance is waving, like a flower in the basement.

651
00:47:03,233 --> 00:47:05,302
Thank you for watching

652
00:48:25,799 --> 00:48:29,743
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello out there, this is Rob, but you might know me in the online world as Sky.

653
00:48:30,284 --> 00:48:40,935
[SPEAKER_04]: On June 23rd at 7pm Pacific Time, join DarkSakura and I for the Orange Lounge, the Bomani Scene's newest talk radio program, where we'll talk about all the latest in everything Bomani.

654
00:48:41,415 --> 00:48:45,620
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a whole show dedicated to those games that we never shut up about.

655
00:48:50,018 --> 00:48:52,102
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura.

656
00:48:52,182 --> 00:48:54,305
[SPEAKER_14]: Why the fuck did you play that one?

657
00:48:54,326 --> 00:48:55,187
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura.

658
00:48:55,267 --> 00:48:57,671
[SPEAKER_14]: Rob, put out your hand.

659
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:00,400
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura DarkSakura

660
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:27,362
[SPEAKER_14]: Alan didn't want to come out.

661
00:49:27,902 --> 00:49:29,303
[SPEAKER_04]: That burp didn't want to come out.

662
00:49:47,085 --> 00:49:48,846
[SPEAKER_04]: So, it's been huge for us.

663
00:49:48,906 --> 00:49:55,828
[SPEAKER_04]: We have so many more listeners now, thanks to iTunes making it really easy to subscribe to podcasts.

664
00:49:55,848 --> 00:49:58,009
[SPEAKER_04]: We have like a million listeners.

665
00:49:58,029 --> 00:49:59,489
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a sobering belch.

666
00:50:00,910 --> 00:50:04,051
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, for those of you guys keeping track at home, I am on shots 6, 7, 8, and 9.

667
00:50:05,390 --> 00:50:08,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Dan is going to be here before too long with my pants.

668
00:50:26,659 --> 00:50:29,840
[SPEAKER_06]: Arcanium 42 made the funniest joke in the chatroom.

669
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:30,320
[SPEAKER_06]: Dark Lekura.

670
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:30,880
[SPEAKER_06]: That is not funny.

671
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:31,521
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't laugh.

672
00:50:31,561 --> 00:50:32,261
[SPEAKER_14]: I laughed a lot.

673
00:50:32,281 --> 00:50:33,501
[SPEAKER_14]: The diva says it's not funny.

674
00:50:33,941 --> 00:50:34,722
[SPEAKER_11]: Too bad.

675
00:50:34,742 --> 00:50:35,002
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

676
00:50:53,703 --> 00:50:55,965
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki was not a part of the show when we first started.

677
00:50:56,225 --> 00:50:57,666
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right, I was a guest.

678
00:50:57,786 --> 00:50:59,007
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki has to wait for us through Berlin.

679
00:50:59,027 --> 00:50:59,988
[SPEAKER_04]: He had to sit on the floor.

680
00:51:00,068 --> 00:51:05,533
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki was a guest host for 19 episodes, and then we were like, well, what the fuck, we'll make him a host.

681
00:51:05,953 --> 00:51:09,796
[SPEAKER_04]: But I feel bad for Angel, because Angel's now been a guest for probably like 50 shows.

682
00:51:09,836 --> 00:51:11,398
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, she stopped showing up, though.

683
00:51:12,659 --> 00:51:13,459
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, where is she?

684
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:18,782
[SPEAKER_04]: She wanted to come tonight, but because of my car break-in, I couldn't provide her transportation after tonight's show.

685
00:51:19,062 --> 00:51:19,942
[SPEAKER_04]: She's listening, I'm sure.

686
00:51:20,363 --> 00:51:21,623
[SPEAKER_04]: Or she's getting an archive of the show.

687
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:27,666
[SPEAKER_04]: But now DDR Angel's been sitting on the floor for like 50 episodes, and now we're like, oh, three's too many.

688
00:51:29,027 --> 00:51:29,807
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, DDR Angel.

689
00:51:29,827 --> 00:51:32,148
[SPEAKER_04]: She's a chronicle.

690
00:51:32,548 --> 00:51:33,709
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, she's our chronic guest.

691
00:51:34,669 --> 00:51:35,890
[SPEAKER_04]: The chronic, yo!

692
00:51:35,990 --> 00:51:36,850
[SPEAKER_04]: She's our chronic.

693
00:51:37,210 --> 00:51:38,031
[SPEAKER_04]: She's a blunt, yo.

694
00:51:38,871 --> 00:51:40,272
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm gonna have more liquor.

695
00:51:40,854 --> 00:51:41,794
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

696
00:51:42,514 --> 00:51:43,615
[SPEAKER_14]: I get to pee first.

697
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:48,276
[SPEAKER_04]: Should I open up the Skype line or should I talk about the Akira Yamaoka album?

698
00:51:48,416 --> 00:51:49,196
[SPEAKER_24]: Akira Yamaoka.

699
00:51:49,336 --> 00:51:50,197
[SPEAKER_04]: Akira Yamaoka.

700
00:51:50,217 --> 00:51:51,757
[SPEAKER_04]: Akira Yamaoka is getting his own album.

701
00:51:51,877 --> 00:51:54,778
[SPEAKER_04]: It's coming out October 28th in Japan.

702
00:51:54,798 --> 00:51:57,479
[SPEAKER_04]: Akira Yamaoka, by the way, did the songs on his last break.

703
00:51:58,139 --> 00:52:02,440
[SPEAKER_04]: Akira Yamaoka, famous for his DDR music, beat mania music, as well as Silent Hill.

704
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:02,920
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.

705
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:04,000
[SPEAKER_04]: What else has he done?

706
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:05,281
[SPEAKER_04]: He did some music for Contra.

707
00:52:05,361 --> 00:52:05,861
[SPEAKER_04]: Contra is.

708
00:52:06,361 --> 00:52:07,002
[SPEAKER_04]: Shattered Soldier

709
00:52:35,930 --> 00:52:40,780
[SPEAKER_04]: And they didn't say anything about Silent Hill songs, but of course Silent Hill already has their own soundtrack, so who cares, right?

710
00:52:41,742 --> 00:52:46,792
[SPEAKER_04]: We have, let's see, two Bomani songs, six cover songs.

711
00:52:47,864 --> 00:52:49,945
[SPEAKER_04]: Which could be just about anything.

712
00:52:50,586 --> 00:52:54,968
[SPEAKER_04]: I know what some of those... Two brand new songs.

713
00:52:55,268 --> 00:52:57,710
[SPEAKER_04]: I know what some of those cover songs are.

714
00:52:57,730 --> 00:52:58,350
[SPEAKER_04]: You think you do.

715
00:52:58,630 --> 00:52:59,511
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't know for sure.

716
00:52:59,571 --> 00:53:00,271
[SPEAKER_04]: You think you might.

717
00:53:00,291 --> 00:53:01,592
[SPEAKER_00]: I suspect with some of those.

718
00:53:01,952 --> 00:53:03,373
[SPEAKER_00]: But I can't say anything, of course.

719
00:53:03,613 --> 00:53:04,473
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyways.

720
00:53:05,574 --> 00:53:07,695
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, I mean, Kiriyama is awesome.

721
00:53:07,735 --> 00:53:09,416
[SPEAKER_04]: So whatever he's going to do is going to be awesome.

722
00:53:09,576 --> 00:53:10,217
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, that's right.

723
00:53:10,377 --> 00:53:10,537
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

724
00:53:13,337 --> 00:53:13,898
[SPEAKER_04]: It should be fun.

725
00:53:13,918 --> 00:53:14,518
[SPEAKER_04]: It should be fun.

726
00:53:14,618 --> 00:53:19,121
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you want more information on that, KonamiStyle.jp has a whole page dedicated to the project.

727
00:53:19,741 --> 00:53:20,882
[SPEAKER_04]: So it should be pretty awesome.

728
00:53:21,322 --> 00:53:21,862
[SPEAKER_04]: So check it out.

729
00:53:22,463 --> 00:53:27,505
[SPEAKER_04]: I am really dizzy.

730
00:53:28,986 --> 00:53:29,406
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

731
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:32,448
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, good point from John Fields.

732
00:53:32,468 --> 00:53:36,511
[SPEAKER_04]: We can make Angel the intern since Zero doesn't show up to the show anymore.

733
00:53:36,891 --> 00:53:38,312
[SPEAKER_04]: Wasn't Magus our intern at one point?

734
00:53:38,492 --> 00:53:40,373
[SPEAKER_04]: No, he's the eternal freshman of Orange Launch.

735
00:53:40,393 --> 00:53:40,693
[SPEAKER_04]: I forgot.

736
00:53:41,115 --> 00:54:01,851
[SPEAKER_04]: He's the keeper of the Portuguese joke book That's right, he's the Portuguese joke book keeper Oh man, I am so dizzy I thought this was interesting, the story you posted earlier this week We'll probably talk about this more on the podcast But the PlayStation 3, $400 to buy a PlayStation 3?

737
00:54:01,931 --> 00:54:03,973
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it going to do my dishes?

738
00:54:04,533 --> 00:54:05,514
[SPEAKER_04]: If not, fuck it

739
00:54:06,550 --> 00:54:10,111
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you do have to understand the Xbox 360 games are $60 each.

740
00:54:10,391 --> 00:54:11,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my, that is insane.

741
00:54:12,051 --> 00:54:12,672
[SPEAKER_04]: That is insane.

742
00:54:14,032 --> 00:54:17,653
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, D of A is pretty, or D of A, it's like a bank suddenly.

743
00:54:18,073 --> 00:54:22,694
[SPEAKER_04]: D or A, Dead or Alive, is pretty cool, but it's not $60 cool.

744
00:54:23,454 --> 00:54:24,395
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's not.

745
00:54:25,335 --> 00:54:29,776
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is what I've got from, like, you know, basically looking at the release dates we have for the...

746
00:54:32,196 --> 00:54:34,637
[SPEAKER_04]: The Xbox 360 is coming out around November 15th.

747
00:54:54,710 --> 00:54:58,374
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, it's going to be about $60 a game for the Xbox 360.

748
00:54:58,774 --> 00:55:01,857
[SPEAKER_04]: I can only assume that the PlayStation 3 stuff is going to be about the same price.

749
00:55:01,917 --> 00:55:05,621
[SPEAKER_04]: If they wanted to be cute, since it's 360, they would release it on March 60th.

750
00:55:07,913 --> 00:55:08,554
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think so.

751
00:55:08,894 --> 00:55:09,875
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not going to happen.

752
00:55:10,316 --> 00:55:13,459
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they're going to release it on November 16th or 15th.

753
00:55:13,939 --> 00:55:14,580
[SPEAKER_04]: It's around there.

754
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:19,425
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, because obviously dates change for the games a lot, so it's up in the air.

755
00:55:19,505 --> 00:55:23,389
[SPEAKER_04]: But most of the publishers are saying that's going to happen at that date.

756
00:55:23,449 --> 00:55:26,932
[SPEAKER_04]: In our chat room, Baka is saying that the games on PS3 are going to be $60 too.

757
00:55:26,952 --> 00:55:29,375
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so it wouldn't be a surprise.

758
00:55:30,930 --> 00:55:32,951
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't spend $50 on a game either.

759
00:55:33,031 --> 00:55:35,433
[SPEAKER_04]: I spent $35 on Meteos and that was like having to give up a finger.

760
00:55:35,453 --> 00:55:37,214
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, most PlayStation 2 games are like $49.99.

761
00:55:37,294 --> 00:55:38,334
[SPEAKER_04]: Not when I buy them.

762
00:55:38,414 --> 00:55:40,956
[SPEAKER_06]: And they wonder why people try to pirate their games.

763
00:55:56,623 --> 00:55:57,624
[SPEAKER_04]: $50 for a game.

764
00:55:58,225 --> 00:55:59,586
[SPEAKER_04]: What about Katamari Damacy?

765
00:55:59,667 --> 00:56:02,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Great game, $20, sold zillions of copies.

766
00:56:02,710 --> 00:56:02,309
$20.

767
00:56:02,750 --> 00:56:04,511
[SPEAKER_04]: That should be a model for all games.

768
00:56:04,592 --> 00:56:05,733
[SPEAKER_04]: Second game, though, was $29.99.

769
00:56:05,833 --> 00:56:06,854
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we raised $10, so...

770
00:56:10,231 --> 00:56:11,992
[SPEAKER_04]: But still though, it's worth the extra 10 bucks.

771
00:56:12,052 --> 00:56:13,632
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still not, you know, 44 or 49.99.

772
00:56:13,672 --> 00:56:21,155
[SPEAKER_04]: Not if they're putting out games like, I don't know, what's a game that sucked on PlayStation?

773
00:56:22,535 --> 00:56:23,075
[SPEAKER_04]: Driver 3.

774
00:56:23,696 --> 00:56:24,756
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, Driver 3.

775
00:56:25,076 --> 00:56:26,957
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm gonna pay 60 bucks for Driver 4.

776
00:56:29,627 --> 00:56:33,769
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I would pay $60 for Final Fantasy XII, although that's supposedly going to be on.

777
00:56:33,789 --> 00:56:37,531
[SPEAKER_04]: The Driver series sucked after the first game.

778
00:56:37,852 --> 00:56:43,295
[SPEAKER_04]: The second game just sucked ass, and the third game was just... It was so bad it was funny.

779
00:56:43,875 --> 00:56:45,837
[SPEAKER_04]: But, I don't know.

780
00:56:46,977 --> 00:56:51,180
[SPEAKER_04]: They think they can justify that amount for the next-gen consoles, because...

781
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:52,802
[SPEAKER_04]: The graphics are better!

782
00:56:54,485 --> 00:56:58,772
[SPEAKER_04]: Game companies, this is why people hack your shit, because you're charging too much for your damn games.

783
00:56:59,272 --> 00:57:02,477
[SPEAKER_14]: It'll probably cost them more to actually make these games.

784
00:57:04,901 --> 00:57:10,443
[SPEAKER_14]: Part of the cost involved with the creation of the games also has to do with fighting loss of profit.

785
00:57:10,483 --> 00:57:11,123
[SPEAKER_14]: They have to make...

786
00:57:24,208 --> 00:57:29,610
[SPEAKER_14]: For a company to be considered successful, they have to make a certain amount over production cost.

787
00:57:30,431 --> 00:57:38,975
[SPEAKER_14]: Therefore, they are trying to accommodate for what they have already lost versus what they may stand to lose and do their prices accordingly.

788
00:57:39,515 --> 00:57:44,397
[SPEAKER_14]: Therefore, a $10 markup in price is not unreasonable nor is it unexpected.

789
00:57:45,595 --> 00:57:46,977
[SPEAKER_04]: What other things could I buy for $60?

790
00:57:47,478 --> 00:57:49,220
[SPEAKER_04]: All the liquor I bought tonight was $40.

791
00:57:49,501 --> 00:57:52,004
[SPEAKER_04]: That's more fun than Driver 3.

792
00:57:52,485 --> 00:57:54,367
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay, because basically games have been about $50 since...

793
00:57:56,374 --> 00:57:58,296
[SPEAKER_04]: Even the Super Nintendo.

794
00:57:58,456 --> 00:58:01,879
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember when Street Fighter was like a $70 game.

795
00:58:01,999 --> 00:58:04,421
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, that's ridiculous.

796
00:58:04,601 --> 00:58:08,544
[SPEAKER_04]: I could get a GameCube for $70 now.

797
00:58:08,944 --> 00:58:11,226
[SPEAKER_04]: That's ridiculous for Street Fighter being that expensive.

798
00:58:11,506 --> 00:58:15,790
[SPEAKER_04]: But I remember most of my Super Nintendo games being about $49.99.

799
00:58:16,991 --> 00:58:18,892
[SPEAKER_04]: It hasn't really changed that much since then.

800
00:58:18,992 --> 00:58:22,955
[SPEAKER_14]: I paid $60 for Killer Instinct when it came out on the Super Nintendo.

801
00:58:22,975 --> 00:58:23,856
[SPEAKER_14]: That's bullshit.

802
00:58:25,217 --> 00:58:26,920
[SPEAKER_04]: This was a shitty port.

803
00:58:27,582 --> 00:58:31,348
[SPEAKER_14]: This was ten years ago that I bought this damn game.

804
00:58:32,029 --> 00:58:34,073
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, with inflation and everything, that's like $80 now.

805
00:58:34,794 --> 00:58:37,439
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously though, $60 isn't that bad.

806
00:58:37,499 --> 00:58:38,461
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, when you consider it.

807
00:58:38,891 --> 00:58:43,373
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the system being $400, yeah, that kind of sucks.

808
00:58:43,833 --> 00:58:53,496
[SPEAKER_04]: But I would hope that this would be a little bit better than, you know, it's going to be playing the next-gen, like, whatever the media is going to be, like, HD, DVD, or Blu-ray, or whatever.

809
00:58:53,997 --> 00:58:54,917
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be playing that.

810
00:58:54,957 --> 00:58:58,478
[SPEAKER_04]: So you've basically got, you know, next-gen players in that sense.

811
00:58:58,838 --> 00:58:59,519
[SPEAKER_04]: You've also got...

812
00:59:00,559 --> 00:59:01,519
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't understand this.

813
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:05,140
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, PlayStation 3, for some reason, had, like, three Ethernet ports on there.

814
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:09,041
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what the hell that's for, but I'm sure they're going to use it for something.

815
00:59:09,281 --> 00:59:11,262
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, I don't know.

816
00:59:11,502 --> 00:59:14,643
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, you know, $399 for the system isn't that bad.

817
00:59:15,003 --> 00:59:18,124
[SPEAKER_04]: People are going to be like, eh, it's kind of expensive, but they're going to pay for it.

818
00:59:18,484 --> 00:59:25,705
[SPEAKER_04]: But the Revolution, though, they're saying is going to be cheaper, much like how, you know, the DS was only $151, the PSP was, like, you know, $300, you know, so...

819
00:59:28,902 --> 00:59:36,787
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, people might, if they're really, you know, concerned about costs, they'll pay for the, you know, the Revolution versus the PS3 or the, um, 360.

820
00:59:37,268 --> 00:59:40,530
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to read some comments in the chat, or moreinsolventradio.com, click on chat.

821
00:59:40,610 --> 00:59:45,293
[SPEAKER_04]: I gotta go get more alcohol, because I'm dizzy as hell, and if I drink some more, I might pass out.

822
00:59:45,313 --> 00:59:45,693
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be good.

823
00:59:45,853 --> 00:59:51,617
[SPEAKER_04]: Sakurina says, uh, I could buy a lot of, and if I mispronounce that, my apologies, at least I didn't say, um, Sakurina.

824
00:59:52,598 --> 00:59:56,820
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I could buy a lot of Kleenex for $60 and could have more fun than Driver 3.

825
00:59:58,002 --> 01:00:03,180
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree, I could buy toilet paper and make a mess of somebody's lawn and that would be more fun than Driver 3.

826
01:00:03,996 --> 01:00:06,177
[SPEAKER_14]: I grabbed my booze instead of my microphone.

827
01:00:06,737 --> 01:00:07,838
[SPEAKER_14]: What's wrong with this picture?

828
01:00:07,858 --> 01:00:08,378
[SPEAKER_14]: That's good.

829
01:00:08,598 --> 01:00:11,839
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I could wipe my ass and have more fun than Driver 3 was.

830
01:00:12,460 --> 01:00:15,301
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, DarkSakura, you're the resident Sega whore.

831
01:00:15,881 --> 01:00:17,962
[SPEAKER_04]: Our resident Sega man whore in the chatroom.

832
01:00:17,982 --> 01:00:20,923
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I think there's two of them, because I think John Fields is a big Sega man whore, too.

833
01:00:20,963 --> 01:00:29,427
[SPEAKER_04]: But the other one that I know of, this local Arcadian42, huge Sega man whore, says Phantasy Star 4 was $100 when it first came out.

834
01:00:29,467 --> 01:00:29,887
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that true?

835
01:00:30,547 --> 01:00:40,899
[SPEAKER_04]: Final Fantasy II was $80, says John Fields.

836
01:00:41,260 --> 01:00:42,060
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's right.

837
01:00:42,121 --> 01:00:43,282
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I remember paying like $70.

838
01:00:43,382 --> 01:00:44,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I didn't pay it.

839
01:00:44,683 --> 01:00:47,066
[SPEAKER_04]: I begged my mommy because I got straight A's.

840
01:00:48,468 --> 01:00:49,889
[SPEAKER_14]: You need a nerdlet.

841
01:00:50,993 --> 01:00:52,274
[SPEAKER_04]: I got straight A's.

842
01:00:52,695 --> 01:00:55,637
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you want to hear about my junior high school experience and straight A's?

843
01:00:56,037 --> 01:00:57,959
[SPEAKER_04]: I got all A's.

844
01:00:58,039 --> 01:01:04,885
[SPEAKER_04]: My first semester of junior high school, I got all A's and a B and P. But my parents never cared about P. So they always threw that out.

845
01:01:04,905 --> 01:01:05,525
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't count that.

846
01:01:05,906 --> 01:01:09,249
[SPEAKER_04]: But my mom would go, you got an A minus in math?

847
01:01:11,310 --> 01:01:12,271
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what I got?

848
01:01:12,291 --> 01:01:16,235
[SPEAKER_14]: A D and a C because I didn't give a fuck.

849
01:01:18,214 --> 01:01:19,535
[SPEAKER_14]: My school bored me.

850
01:01:20,256 --> 01:01:25,400
[SPEAKER_14]: And I would make A's on all of my tests, but get zeros for homework because I wouldn't fucking do it.

851
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:26,341
[SPEAKER_04]: That was me too.

852
01:01:26,421 --> 01:01:27,302
[SPEAKER_04]: I never did my homework.

853
01:01:27,822 --> 01:01:28,603
[SPEAKER_04]: I was a bad boy.

854
01:01:30,104 --> 01:01:32,146
[SPEAKER_04]: That first semester of junior high, it went all downhill from there.

855
01:01:32,346 --> 01:01:35,008
[SPEAKER_04]: I just started not doing homework and stuff, and I slacked off.

856
01:01:35,849 --> 01:01:37,350
[SPEAKER_04]: And look where I'm at now, kids.

857
01:01:38,071 --> 01:01:39,932
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm on an internet radio station.

858
01:01:41,113 --> 01:01:42,394
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to be like me?

859
01:01:42,535 --> 01:01:44,036
[SPEAKER_14]: We're fucking celebrities.

860
01:01:44,816 --> 01:01:46,418
[SPEAKER_14]: Because we didn't do well in school.

861
01:01:48,854 --> 01:01:51,136
[SPEAKER_04]: Baka wants to know how I got a B in PE.

862
01:01:51,716 --> 01:01:55,078
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I could run a mile in like 14 minutes.

863
01:01:55,499 --> 01:01:57,140
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how I got a B in PE.

864
01:01:59,681 --> 01:02:02,403
[SPEAKER_04]: My best friend in junior high and I used to walk the mile every day.

865
01:02:03,284 --> 01:02:06,086
[SPEAKER_04]: We would run until the teacher couldn't see us anymore, then we'd walk the rest of it.

866
01:02:06,506 --> 01:02:06,966
[SPEAKER_04]: It's awesome.

867
01:02:07,106 --> 01:02:11,189
[SPEAKER_14]: One time, just to prove I could do it, I sprinted a half mile.

868
01:02:12,670 --> 01:02:13,711
[SPEAKER_14]: Just to prove I could do it.

869
01:02:15,492 --> 01:02:17,634
[SPEAKER_04]: I would barf if I ever tried that.

870
01:02:18,427 --> 01:02:18,947
[SPEAKER_04]: You're horrible.

871
01:02:19,668 --> 01:02:20,469
[SPEAKER_14]: I ran for it.

872
01:02:20,529 --> 01:02:21,870
[SPEAKER_14]: I was so tired by the time I got there.

873
01:02:22,190 --> 01:02:23,711
[SPEAKER_14]: But I beat everybody, damn it.

874
01:02:25,153 --> 01:02:28,115
[SPEAKER_14]: And now I can't run because I'm injured.

875
01:02:29,977 --> 01:02:31,278
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to make an announcement here.

876
01:02:31,318 --> 01:02:34,180
[SPEAKER_04]: I think if the site's still up right now, because the site's been going up and down.

877
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:34,701
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, never mind.

878
01:02:35,261 --> 01:02:35,541
[SPEAKER_04]: Never mind.

879
01:02:35,802 --> 01:02:36,422
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll talk about it later.

880
01:02:37,063 --> 01:02:37,403
[SPEAKER_04]: It's down.

881
01:02:39,565 --> 01:02:40,385
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to...

882
01:02:43,137 --> 01:02:45,260
[SPEAKER_04]: Baka says I'm in the chatroom.

883
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:51,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Baka in our chatroom says, and our chatroom's over at www.orangeloungeradio.com.

884
01:02:52,251 --> 01:02:54,915
[SPEAKER_04]: Click on, what is it, chat?

885
01:02:54,935 --> 01:02:55,016
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

886
01:02:56,913 --> 01:02:59,114
[SPEAKER_04]: I cannot believe that you were drunk off of that.

887
01:02:59,895 --> 01:03:01,256
[SPEAKER_04]: Baka says, I'm Asian.

888
01:03:01,436 --> 01:03:03,377
[SPEAKER_04]: I get 3.6s and 4.0s.

889
01:03:04,557 --> 01:03:06,658
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to hear from an Asian who gets shitty grades.

890
01:03:07,059 --> 01:03:07,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously.

891
01:03:08,099 --> 01:03:11,941
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to hear from somebody who defies the stereotype and gets like Cs and Ds.

892
01:03:12,342 --> 01:03:15,363
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that's a messed up stereotype that all Asians get like good grades.

893
01:03:15,743 --> 01:03:18,765
[SPEAKER_04]: Surely there's a flunky Asian out there somewhere and I want to hear from them.

894
01:03:22,587 --> 01:03:25,849

01:03:34,484 --> 01:03:36,584
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki's taking way too long with his next drinks.

901
01:03:38,264 --> 01:03:38,524
[SPEAKER_04]: Man.

902
01:03:39,025 --> 01:03:40,285
[SPEAKER_14]: He's talking about puking.

903
01:03:40,525 --> 01:03:41,945
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm hearing him talking about puking, too.

904
01:03:42,865 --> 01:03:47,967
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, somebody in our chatroom disputing us there saying we're not celebrities, but we're close.

905
01:03:48,247 --> 01:03:49,807
[SPEAKER_14]: We are two fucking celebrities.

906
01:03:52,045 --> 01:03:54,807
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't we have pages upon pages of internet stuff?

907
01:03:54,827 --> 01:03:55,987
[SPEAKER_04]: I have 140 friends on Myspace.

908
01:03:56,007 --> 01:03:56,868
[SPEAKER_04]: Doesn't that make me a celebrity?

909
01:03:57,248 --> 01:03:57,408
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

910
01:03:57,668 --> 01:03:59,950
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that just makes you a big internet nerd.

911
01:03:59,990 --> 01:04:01,290
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna let you guys in on a secret.

912
01:04:01,310 --> 01:04:02,071
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a big secret.

913
01:04:03,312 --> 01:04:05,233
[SPEAKER_19]: We don't really believe the celebrity thing.

914
01:04:05,293 --> 01:04:06,033
[SPEAKER_19]: It's just a joke.

915
01:04:06,414 --> 01:04:06,694
Okay?

916
01:04:07,734 --> 01:04:08,335
Guess what?

917
01:04:08,555 --> 01:04:08,795
[SPEAKER_19]: What?

918
01:04:09,115 --> 01:04:11,016
[SPEAKER_16]: I really am a celebrity.

919
01:04:15,019 --> 01:04:17,240
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki's talking about puke.

920
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:18,841
[SPEAKER_13]: Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

921
01:04:21,238 --> 01:04:23,760
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope we get a call on the skypline at some point.

922
01:04:23,780 --> 01:04:24,161
[SPEAKER_04]: Skypline!

923
01:04:24,201 --> 01:04:25,022
[SPEAKER_04]: Fucking call us!

924
01:04:25,042 --> 01:04:28,845
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to do... Did you hear about Britney Spears?

925
01:04:28,925 --> 01:04:29,506
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut up, shut up.

926
01:04:29,626 --> 01:04:31,648
[SPEAKER_04]: She's still smoking and pregnant.

927
01:04:31,888 --> 01:04:34,590
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, for those keeping drink tally at home, what are you on now?

928
01:04:34,891 --> 01:04:35,812
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm on 7 and 8.

929
01:04:36,012 --> 01:04:36,672
[SPEAKER_04]: We're getting a call.

930
01:04:38,674 --> 01:04:40,996
[SPEAKER_04]: 7 and 8 and I'm very, very, very dizzy.

931
01:04:41,116 --> 01:04:42,237
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to the phone lines.

932
01:04:42,278 --> 01:04:43,499
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

933
01:04:44,199 --> 01:04:45,200
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey Sky, Siggy here.

934
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:46,822
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi Siggy, how are you?

935
01:04:47,978 --> 01:04:48,919
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm doing fine.

936
01:04:48,959 --> 01:04:50,380
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy birthday, OLR.

937
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:51,381
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

938
01:04:51,401 --> 01:04:53,062
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate it.

939
01:04:53,122 --> 01:04:55,124
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob is sounding especially gay today.

940
01:04:55,244 --> 01:04:56,365
[SPEAKER_04]: We're potty trained now.

941
01:04:56,385 --> 01:04:58,026
[SPEAKER_04]: We're three years old and we're learning how to read.

942
01:04:58,647 --> 01:05:00,348
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm a big kid now.

943
01:05:01,509 --> 01:05:02,610
[SPEAKER_04]: What's on your mind, Siggy?

944
01:05:03,450 --> 01:05:04,471
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a drink with us, Siggy.

945
01:05:04,751 --> 01:05:04,932
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you 21?

946
01:05:04,992 --> 01:05:07,073
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm 25.

947
01:05:07,714 --> 01:05:07,914
[SPEAKER_04]: Good.

948
01:05:07,954 --> 01:05:08,855
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a drink with us, Siggy.

949
01:05:09,602 --> 01:05:11,063
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'd rather have sake, thank you.

950
01:05:11,363 --> 01:05:11,623
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

951
01:05:12,004 --> 01:05:12,684
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

952
01:05:12,704 --> 01:05:14,906
[SPEAKER_04]: I want some sake.

953
01:05:15,226 --> 01:05:16,166
[SPEAKER_04]: It's too expensive.

954
01:05:16,206 --> 01:05:16,807
[SPEAKER_04]: I couldn't buy that.

955
01:05:17,147 --> 01:05:18,788
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, sake, I'm only 30!

956
01:05:19,228 --> 01:05:20,109
[SPEAKER_04]: Sake, you lady.

957
01:05:20,449 --> 01:05:21,590
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, bite me.

958
01:05:21,650 --> 01:05:22,430
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up, Ziggy?

959
01:05:22,450 --> 01:05:23,071
[SPEAKER_05]: What's on your mind?

960
01:05:23,646 --> 01:05:28,428
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I got some, uh, announcement, uh, regarding to, uh, Beat Media 2DX12, Happy Sky.

961
01:05:28,608 --> 01:05:31,129
[SPEAKER_05]: I was gonna say, you had some, you have some news on Happy Sky, don't you?

962
01:05:31,149 --> 01:05:32,050
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up with Happy Sky?

963
01:05:33,230 --> 01:05:38,232
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, it's gonna, uh, in Japan, it's gonna be released July 13th, which is gonna be nine days from now.

964
01:05:38,712 --> 01:05:40,253
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, that's soon, that's awesome.

965
01:05:40,293 --> 01:05:42,854
[SPEAKER_04]: Are there any, like, new songs that are supposed to be in the final release?

966
01:05:43,475 --> 01:05:48,317
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause you know how sometimes there's, um, songs in the final release that weren't in the beta test?

967
01:05:49,917 --> 01:05:50,758
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they doing any of that?

968
01:05:51,178 --> 01:05:51,278
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

969
01:05:53,001 --> 01:05:59,708
[SPEAKER_05]: They're already done with the location test, but there haven't been any new songs announced as of late.

970
01:06:01,130 --> 01:06:03,392
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be great if there was a couple more new ones, though.

971
01:06:04,734 --> 01:06:05,054
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

972
01:06:06,376 --> 01:06:14,024
[SPEAKER_05]: And then some other news, like... I don't think this has been announced, but Konami has already made their own record label.

973
01:06:15,137 --> 01:06:15,517
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

974
01:06:16,137 --> 01:06:18,118
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's called 573 Records.

975
01:06:18,698 --> 01:06:20,878
[SPEAKER_05]: That is the most awesome name ever.

976
01:06:21,418 --> 01:06:22,879
[SPEAKER_05]: I have hiccups now.

977
01:06:23,559 --> 01:06:25,999
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that what labeled the Akira Yamaoka album is going to come out?

978
01:06:26,059 --> 01:06:26,859
[SPEAKER_19]: My hand's numb.

979
01:06:26,939 --> 01:06:35,641
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure, but when I checked the website for 573 Records, they're mostly hip-hop and R&B artists that have signed up for it.

980
01:06:36,521 --> 01:06:37,662
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the website?

981
01:06:38,682 --> 01:06:39,062
[SPEAKER_05]: Here it is.

982
01:06:39,622 --> 01:06:41,382
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me link it on the chat room.

983
01:06:41,782 --> 01:06:42,363
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, super.

984
01:06:42,443 --> 01:06:42,703
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

985
01:06:44,949 --> 01:06:52,552
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, all this talk about Japanese music has me thinking about, did you hear about those huge Live 8 concerts that were going on yesterday?

986
01:06:52,652 --> 01:06:53,332
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

987
01:06:54,032 --> 01:06:55,313
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm glad I missed them.

988
01:06:55,473 --> 01:06:57,353
[SPEAKER_04]: You know who played at the one in Tokyo?

989
01:06:57,754 --> 01:06:57,934
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

990
01:06:58,594 --> 01:06:59,434
[SPEAKER_04]: Dreams Come True.

991
01:07:00,535 --> 01:07:01,695
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god.

992
01:07:01,915 --> 01:07:02,795
[SPEAKER_04]: That's crazy.

993
01:07:02,815 --> 01:07:03,276
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.

994
01:07:03,456 --> 01:07:03,716
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

995
01:07:04,296 --> 01:07:06,597
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a 21 website, so I'm going to mention it on there.

996
01:07:06,617 --> 01:07:08,097
[SPEAKER_05]: It's www.onami.jp.mm.573.

997
01:07:08,117 --> 01:07:08,377
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

998
01:07:14,057 --> 01:07:15,698
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm going to go look at it right now.

999
01:07:15,738 --> 01:07:20,461
[SPEAKER_23]: That reminds me, I need to purchase some of the brand new diverse system stuff.

1000
01:07:20,981 --> 01:07:28,726
[SPEAKER_04]: I've kept asking in their stupid bulletin board system whether or not they'll be able to ship this stuff to me because it's not listed on the U.S.

1001
01:07:28,786 --> 01:07:29,667
[SPEAKER_04]: site, but they're U.S.

1002
01:07:30,620 --> 01:07:33,403
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1003
01:07:49,651 --> 01:07:54,576
[SPEAKER_04]: and Diverse8's out, and then there's Dear Taka and Dear Desire also.

1004
01:07:55,436 --> 01:07:57,058
[SPEAKER_04]: So I need to get those as well.

1005
01:07:57,598 --> 01:08:00,641
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know, D7 I need to get as well.

1006
01:08:01,002 --> 01:08:02,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I need to catch up with all their stuff.

1007
01:08:02,683 --> 01:08:07,628
[SPEAKER_04]: And I love, oh my god, I've got to listen to the Trip Machine Dark Core version.

1008
01:08:07,688 --> 01:08:08,348
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that.

1009
01:08:08,469 --> 01:08:12,092
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, 573 Records is a UMA creative production.

1010
01:08:12,152 --> 01:08:14,734
[SPEAKER_04]: That just makes me think that, UMA, UMA!

1011
01:08:15,615 --> 01:08:16,336
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember in Maxx?

1012
01:08:19,506 --> 01:08:20,347
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh... Shut up.

1013
01:08:20,768 --> 01:08:21,448
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1014
01:08:21,609 --> 01:08:22,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Siggy, you know what I'm talking about, right?

1015
01:08:22,930 --> 01:08:23,971
[SPEAKER_04]: UMA, UMA!

1016
01:08:25,293 --> 01:08:25,754
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1017
01:08:26,795 --> 01:08:28,937
[SPEAKER_24]: So, my hand's numb.

1018
01:08:28,997 --> 01:08:30,699
[SPEAKER_24]: Is that a bad thing?

1019
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:31,380
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1020
01:08:32,321 --> 01:08:33,423
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanna take a nap.

1021
01:08:33,643 --> 01:08:34,224
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I want.

1022
01:08:34,264 --> 01:08:35,986
[SPEAKER_06]: Siggy, what else is on your mind?

1023
01:08:36,877 --> 01:08:41,560
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, um, there's a, yeah, you already know about Dance 86.4, right?

1024
01:08:43,161 --> 01:08:44,942
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that, it's 86.4?

1025
01:08:45,002 --> 01:08:46,584
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought it was like 95, I don't know.

1026
01:08:46,684 --> 01:08:47,364
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, 86.4.

1027
01:08:48,585 --> 01:08:48,905
[SPEAKER_05]: It's 86.4.

1028
01:08:49,065 --> 01:08:55,289
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a, you know, they pronounce it as a Dansuya Royo, or it's translated as a Let's Dance.

1029
01:08:55,610 --> 01:08:55,950
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh-huh.

1030
01:08:56,110 --> 01:08:56,450
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1031
01:08:56,750 --> 01:08:59,512
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw the news on DDR Freak, and I was just like, you know.

1032
01:08:59,532 --> 01:09:02,514
[SPEAKER_23]: 86.4, wasn't that that stupid game that was coming out?

1033
01:09:02,534 --> 01:09:04,115
[SPEAKER_23]: I remember some.

1034
01:09:04,135 --> 01:09:06,217
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't it like three panel dancing or something?

1035
01:09:06,257 --> 01:09:06,497
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1036
01:09:07,987 --> 01:09:08,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.

1037
01:09:08,527 --> 01:09:08,828
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1038
01:09:10,749 --> 01:09:20,357
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, I heard about it, but... You know, if I'm going to do any type of, like, three-panel dancing or anything like that, it's going to be, like, from Dance FM or something like that, or whatever that is.

1039
01:09:20,597 --> 01:09:23,139
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm not at Dance FM.

1040
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,602
[SPEAKER_24]: Neon FM, that's what I meant.

1041
01:09:29,885 --> 01:09:31,266
[SPEAKER_04]: My brain feels numb.

1042
01:09:31,486 --> 01:09:31,747
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

1043
01:09:32,207 --> 01:09:34,369
[SPEAKER_04]: Ziggy, we got other people calling in, so I'm going to let you go.

1044
01:09:34,429 --> 01:09:35,490
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there anything else you want to share with us?

1045
01:09:35,510 --> 01:09:35,830
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all right.

1046
01:09:37,463 --> 01:09:38,787
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing much else.

1047
01:09:39,148 --> 01:09:43,119
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Kiki, thanks for being a loyal fan of ours for at least a year now.

1048
01:09:45,646 --> 01:09:46,507
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, over a year.

1049
01:09:46,527 --> 01:09:47,708
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what, you guys?

1050
01:09:47,868 --> 01:09:49,289
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's something I gotta mention.

1051
01:09:49,309 --> 01:09:51,250
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I've been meaning to do this for a while.

1052
01:09:51,330 --> 01:09:52,571
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on, let me say goodbye to Siggy first.

1053
01:09:52,591 --> 01:09:54,273
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless you're gonna say something to Siggy.

1054
01:09:54,353 --> 01:09:54,933
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this to Siggy?

1055
01:09:55,053 --> 01:09:56,314
[SPEAKER_04]: This is to everyone.

1056
01:09:56,795 --> 01:09:58,016
[SPEAKER_05]: I got nothing much else to say.

1057
01:09:58,236 --> 01:09:59,697
[SPEAKER_05]: Just happy 4th of July.

1058
01:10:00,057 --> 01:10:00,518
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1059
01:10:00,558 --> 01:10:01,318
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a good one, Siggy.

1060
01:10:01,358 --> 01:10:01,939
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for supporting us.

1061
01:10:01,959 --> 01:10:03,220
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't buy the crappy fireworks.

1062
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:04,020
[SPEAKER_04]: Stay cool.

1063
01:10:05,902 --> 01:10:10,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless you live in the states that have the good... Let him say his piece.

1064
01:10:11,046 --> 01:10:11,646
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, Siggy.

1065
01:10:12,367 --> 01:10:12,547
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

1066
01:10:12,607 --> 01:10:14,529
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't like fireworks anyway, so... Yeah.

1067
01:10:15,550 --> 01:10:16,390
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a good one, Siggy.

1068
01:10:16,430 --> 01:10:18,612
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to let you go, okay?

1069
01:10:18,713 --> 01:10:19,313
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye, Siggy.

1070
01:10:19,573 --> 01:10:20,454
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm very disappointed.

1071
01:10:20,775 --> 01:10:24,498
[SPEAKER_23]: Other states other than California have really kick-ass fireworks.

1072
01:10:25,159 --> 01:10:28,342
[SPEAKER_23]: We have these really shitty ones that burn out in 30 seconds.

1073
01:10:28,722 --> 01:10:32,145
[SPEAKER_04]: But no, they get the ones with the actual mortars and...

1074
01:10:33,416 --> 01:10:34,337
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

1075
01:10:59,212 --> 01:11:00,213
[SPEAKER_04]: What was I going to say?

1076
01:11:00,473 --> 01:11:01,454
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, I'm really drunk.

1077
01:11:02,935 --> 01:11:03,875
[SPEAKER_04]: Then let's take another call.

1078
01:11:04,636 --> 01:11:05,216
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do that.

1079
01:11:05,236 --> 01:11:07,358
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to drink some more.

1080
01:11:08,158 --> 01:11:09,199
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to say hi to the caller.

1081
01:11:14,082 --> 01:11:15,543
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1082
01:11:16,604 --> 01:11:18,405
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, is this Sal's Pizza?

1083
01:11:18,945 --> 01:11:21,307
[SPEAKER_04]: No, this is not Sal's Pizza.

1084
01:11:22,188 --> 01:11:23,709
[SPEAKER_27]: Hey Sky, it's John Fields.

1085
01:11:23,829 --> 01:11:25,009
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi John Fields, how are you?

1086
01:11:25,030 --> 01:11:26,811
[SPEAKER_04]: What's on your mind?

1087
01:11:29,502 --> 01:11:31,363
[SPEAKER_27]: Congratulations on making it to three years.

1088
01:11:51,033 --> 01:11:51,994
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm always a bitch.

1089
01:11:52,034 --> 01:11:57,297
[SPEAKER_27]: You guys were, let's see, you were back at the, at that apartment building, I believe.

1090
01:11:57,457 --> 01:11:57,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

1091
01:11:57,717 --> 01:11:58,058
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1092
01:11:58,378 --> 01:11:59,058
[SPEAKER_04]: The pink place.

1093
01:11:59,178 --> 01:12:03,361
[SPEAKER_27]: And at that point, I don't think the machine had been started on by Loki yet.

1094
01:12:05,343 --> 01:12:06,783
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't, no, I don't think it had been.

1095
01:12:08,144 --> 01:12:11,086
[SPEAKER_04]: The time Jon was here, we had that old layout in the old studio.

1096
01:12:11,286 --> 01:12:12,127
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, you know what?

1097
01:12:12,247 --> 01:12:13,888
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to play some more Final Fantasy.

1098
01:12:13,928 --> 01:12:15,629
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been like way too much.

1099
01:12:15,669 --> 01:12:16,290
[SPEAKER_14]: Let Jon talk.

1100
01:12:16,310 --> 01:12:16,370
[SPEAKER_06]: Shh.

1101
01:12:18,689 --> 01:12:19,729
[SPEAKER_14]: Both of you, both of you.

1102
01:12:20,990 --> 01:12:21,490
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, John.

1103
01:12:21,530 --> 01:12:22,731
[SPEAKER_14]: John, you may speak.

1104
01:12:24,372 --> 01:12:29,375
[SPEAKER_27]: While I was there, if some of you remember, I actually stole Loki's library of songs and such.

1105
01:12:30,976 --> 01:12:32,377
[SPEAKER_04]: I vaguely recall, yes.

1106
01:12:33,197 --> 01:12:38,961
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember, didn't you take a tour of Tech TV when you were out here and you were talking about how awesome Tech TV was and then they got sold?

1107
01:12:39,141 --> 01:12:42,823
[SPEAKER_27]: I did, and I was really upset when G4 brought them out.

1108
01:12:42,843 --> 01:12:44,084
[SPEAKER_27]: Rob, get your fucking glasses over here.

1109
01:12:44,625 --> 01:12:45,645
[SPEAKER_27]: Let the caller talk.

1110
01:12:46,046 --> 01:12:51,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, Jamie is too busy thinking about drinking to be listening right now, but I am listening to you, John.

1111
01:12:52,008 --> 01:12:54,529
[SPEAKER_04]: Tech TV got sold the next day and you were pissed.

1112
01:12:55,930 --> 01:12:57,671
[SPEAKER_27]: It was more like a year, but yeah.

1113
01:12:58,551 --> 01:13:00,952
[SPEAKER_27]: I was hoping to get a job there, but I guess not.

1114
01:13:01,092 --> 01:13:02,513
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you say get a job with PETA?

1115
01:13:03,129 --> 01:13:04,030
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's G4.

1116
01:13:04,471 --> 01:13:04,691
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.

1117
01:13:05,492 --> 01:13:06,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, you know what's really funny?

1118
01:13:06,413 --> 01:13:07,274
[SPEAKER_04]: This brings up a good point.

1119
01:13:07,815 --> 01:13:10,518
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a good segue, because somebody's chatting with me in private message right now.

1120
01:13:10,778 --> 01:13:12,841
[SPEAKER_04]: John, I don't mean to interrupt you, but you'll like this too.

1121
01:13:13,241 --> 01:13:18,247
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, DeepThought42 in our chat room, who I think might be a new listener.

1122
01:13:18,287 --> 01:13:20,510
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't recognize the name, but then again, I'm drunk, so I apologize.

1123
01:13:20,550 --> 01:13:21,030
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't either.

1124
01:13:21,090 --> 01:13:23,093
[SPEAKER_14]: And you're talking, you've got the speaker way too loud.

1125
01:13:25,174 --> 01:13:32,218
[SPEAKER_04]: DeepThought42 was saying that on attack of the show, I guess they're looking for co-hosts right now.

1126
01:13:32,658 --> 01:13:36,580
[SPEAKER_04]: And he sent them an email saying that we should do it.

1127
01:13:38,171 --> 01:13:40,192
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think the rest of you guys should send him an email.

1128
01:13:40,432 --> 01:13:41,913
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, that'd be awesome.

1129
01:13:41,973 --> 01:13:46,435
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to know where to send that email, ask DeepThought42, because he knows.

1130
01:13:47,035 --> 01:13:49,636
[SPEAKER_04]: And send them an email saying that we should host.

1131
01:13:49,976 --> 01:13:56,379
[SPEAKER_04]: Although seriously, what if he sent that email last week and now they're listening tonight and we're all just fucked up out of our minds?

1132
01:13:56,820 --> 01:13:58,500
[SPEAKER_04]: They would totally are in.

1133
01:13:58,620 --> 01:13:59,481
[SPEAKER_14]: No, no, no, no, no, no.

1134
01:14:00,041 --> 01:14:06,204
[SPEAKER_14]: This is our opportunity that we can prove that we fit in in Hollywood because we can perform drunk or on drugs.

1135
01:14:06,772 --> 01:14:08,573
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, I am like... No, we don't do drugs.

1136
01:14:08,593 --> 01:14:09,093
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't do drugs.

1137
01:14:09,273 --> 01:14:10,353
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't do drugs.

1138
01:14:10,533 --> 01:14:11,734
[SPEAKER_14]: Drugs are not cool.

1139
01:14:11,754 --> 01:14:13,815
[SPEAKER_14]: I do Vicodin, but I'm on a prescription for Vicodin.

1140
01:14:13,855 --> 01:14:22,858
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't do drugs because I can't swallow pills and have a phobia with needles, so the drugs are out of the picture, but alcohol is perfectly fine.

1141
01:14:24,038 --> 01:14:24,359
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

1142
01:14:24,699 --> 01:14:25,759
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyway, I'm sorry, John.

1143
01:14:26,279 --> 01:14:27,400
[SPEAKER_04]: Why did you call in anyway?

1144
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:28,440
[SPEAKER_04]: What's on your mind?

1145
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:29,981
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, I've got two things.

1146
01:14:30,061 --> 01:14:30,421
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1147
01:14:30,501 --> 01:14:33,302
[SPEAKER_27]: First, I'd like to reflect on one of my favorite memories.

1148
01:14:33,683 --> 01:14:44,949
[SPEAKER_27]: and that was actually when Karaoke Revolution first came out and Loki was singing, what was it, It's the End of the World and then also I'm Staying In or whatever it was.

1149
01:14:46,229 --> 01:14:48,110
[SPEAKER_04]: That show was awesome.

1150
01:14:48,310 --> 01:14:51,012
[SPEAKER_23]: It was I'm Staying In and it was, what was the other one?

1151
01:14:51,132 --> 01:14:53,513
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to say it was Complicated or something.

1152
01:14:53,573 --> 01:14:54,954
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, Complicated.

1153
01:14:55,694 --> 01:14:58,255
[SPEAKER_23]: There's another one that Nellie was talking about yesterday.

1154
01:14:58,416 --> 01:15:01,177
[SPEAKER_23]: It was, oh God, I don't remember the song.

1155
01:15:03,303 --> 01:15:04,846
[SPEAKER_23]: Never mind, I'm not even going to remember it.

1156
01:15:05,327 --> 01:15:14,627
[SPEAKER_23]: There was another song that she was singing that should be in Karaoke Revolution, and it was funny, but never mind, I can't remember it, so I'm not going to.

1157
01:15:15,151 --> 01:15:19,893
[SPEAKER_04]: That was one of my favorite shows, too, because any time Loki makes an ass out of himself is a good show to me.

1158
01:15:19,913 --> 01:15:23,755
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, you know, Karaoke Revolution Party Edition is going to be coming out in, I think, September.

1159
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:25,696
[SPEAKER_04]: We are all over that shit, too.

1160
01:15:25,836 --> 01:15:26,757
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, not September.

1161
01:15:26,777 --> 01:15:27,177
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

1162
01:15:27,197 --> 01:15:28,958
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be November.

1163
01:15:30,398 --> 01:15:33,860
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, same day, I think, Ultramix 3 is coming out.

1164
01:15:33,880 --> 01:15:37,502
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be November, I want to say, 23rd or something like that.

1165
01:15:38,733 --> 01:15:43,698
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to be when Karaoke Revolution Party Edition is going to be coming out for all three systems.

1166
01:15:46,481 --> 01:15:47,202
[SPEAKER_04]: That's scary.

1167
01:15:48,723 --> 01:15:54,887
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so I'm trying to find a clip of that episode where he's singing, but I'm so drunk I can't navigate my computer right now.

1168
01:15:55,407 --> 01:15:57,109
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll keep looking on it.

1169
01:15:57,129 --> 01:15:58,069
[SPEAKER_27]: I'll find one on my computer.

1170
01:15:58,089 --> 01:15:58,790
[SPEAKER_27]: I think I got one.

1171
01:15:58,810 --> 01:15:59,510
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be awesome.

1172
01:15:59,530 --> 01:16:02,852
[SPEAKER_04]: Feels like someone shot Novocaine straight into my brain.

1173
01:16:02,872 --> 01:16:06,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody had it uploaded somewhere, so we gotta find that somewhere.

1174
01:16:06,875 --> 01:16:13,579
[SPEAKER_04]: I only have... The only Loki sound clip I have is somewhere else.

1175
01:16:13,639 --> 01:16:15,441
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't even... God, this is horrible.

1176
01:16:15,701 --> 01:16:17,482
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, what's your other thing you wanted to call it out, John?

1177
01:16:18,396 --> 01:16:20,298
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, I need to make an announcement, actually.

1178
01:16:21,199 --> 01:16:24,521
[SPEAKER_27]: As you all know, I am a huge Phantasy Star Online whore.

1179
01:16:25,462 --> 01:16:30,907
[SPEAKER_27]: And after all the success that Red vs. Blue has had, I have decided to start my own machinima.

1180
01:16:32,448 --> 01:16:35,411
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're going to do a Phantasy Star version of Red vs. Blue?

1181
01:16:35,431 --> 01:16:38,974
[SPEAKER_14]: You have to play PSO on... Rob, turn the speaker down!

1182
01:16:38,994 --> 01:16:42,798
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, that's the only way I can hear the Skype.

1183
01:16:42,818 --> 01:16:43,698
[SPEAKER_06]: It's down, it's down.

1184
01:16:43,999 --> 01:16:45,480
[SPEAKER_14]: You need to play PSO with me.

1185
01:16:48,109 --> 01:16:48,930
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, now I can hear.

1186
01:16:49,610 --> 01:16:50,130
[SPEAKER_14]: Johnny there?

1187
01:16:50,911 --> 01:16:51,351
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, I am.

1188
01:16:52,372 --> 01:16:58,055
[SPEAKER_27]: Basically, it's really in the early production stages, but I've worked out how I'm going to make the camera work.

1189
01:16:59,396 --> 01:17:07,481
[SPEAKER_27]: And at this point, I'm actually trying to figure out how to get the characters that aren't androids to actually move their mouths.

1190
01:17:08,021 --> 01:17:15,406
[SPEAKER_27]: And I found someone that managed to do that, but he got a little scared after he saw how much work there was.

1191
01:17:16,566 --> 01:17:21,191
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm going to post what he showed me in the chat room as well.

1192
01:17:21,911 --> 01:17:29,980
[SPEAKER_27]: So if anybody wants to sign on and help make this a reality, I'm asking for any help I can get at this point.

1193
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:31,221
[SPEAKER_04]: John, more power to you.

1194
01:17:31,241 --> 01:17:33,984
[SPEAKER_04]: Red vs. Blue is hilarious and PSO is a great game.

1195
01:17:34,024 --> 01:17:36,887
[SPEAKER_04]: So any luck that you have with this, I think it would be awesome.

1196
01:17:37,748 --> 01:17:42,029
[SPEAKER_04]: Plug away in our chat room and chatters, help John out because this is a good project.

1197
01:17:42,449 --> 01:17:43,089
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely.

1198
01:17:43,229 --> 01:17:48,451
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to participate in this because I think that being the diva I am, I must be involved.

1199
01:17:48,491 --> 01:17:51,452
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, and also, I mean, especially, I mean, look at Red vs. Blue.

1200
01:17:51,492 --> 01:17:54,632
[SPEAKER_23]: They're basically now a spokesperson for like Halo and stuff.

1201
01:17:54,672 --> 01:17:56,093
[SPEAKER_23]: I mean, that's awesome.

1202
01:17:56,313 --> 01:17:58,413
[SPEAKER_04]: John, you could be the Sega spokesperson.

1203
01:17:58,433 --> 01:18:00,554
[SPEAKER_04]: Would that just not make you a happy little fanboy or what?

1204
01:18:01,414 --> 01:18:04,396
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, I applied to be a GM last year, but that didn't work out.

1205
01:18:04,436 --> 01:18:05,036
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh my god.

1206
01:18:05,076 --> 01:18:06,097
[SPEAKER_27]: That's close, I'm gonna get.

1207
01:18:06,337 --> 01:18:06,938
[SPEAKER_27]: You know what?

1208
01:18:07,138 --> 01:18:28,372
[SPEAKER_23]: I actually have a business card, or at least I had a business card, for a guy that was the Halo, or not the Halo, the 1008, so drunk, anyways, no, no, the Sega guy, um, that was the, um, I wanna say the production manager there at Sega, that they, um, I met them at, um, what was it, one of these, um,

1209
01:18:29,403 --> 01:18:29,583
[SPEAKER_23]: and so on.

1210
01:18:50,596 --> 01:18:53,277
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see if I can find that card somewhere.

1211
01:18:53,337 --> 01:18:53,677
[SPEAKER_27]: All right.

1212
01:18:54,018 --> 01:18:58,219
[SPEAKER_27]: And I've actually spoken with one of the GMs already about this project, and he's really interested.

1213
01:18:58,259 --> 01:19:01,741
[SPEAKER_27]: So hopefully I'll get the support of Sega behind me as well on this one.

1214
01:19:01,761 --> 01:19:01,981
[SPEAKER_04]: Good.

1215
01:19:02,141 --> 01:19:02,901
[SPEAKER_04]: John, make it happen.

1216
01:19:02,921 --> 01:19:03,641
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got our support.

1217
01:19:03,661 --> 01:19:05,702
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll plug it on the podcast or something.

1218
01:19:06,242 --> 01:19:06,522
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1219
01:19:06,843 --> 01:19:07,403
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, thank you.

1220
01:19:07,423 --> 01:19:08,183
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a good one, John.

1221
01:19:08,203 --> 01:19:09,023
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for calling in.

1222
01:19:09,564 --> 01:19:11,404
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, and once again, happy third anniversary.

1223
01:19:11,524 --> 01:19:13,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, and thanks for supporting us over the past couple years.

1224
01:19:13,645 --> 01:19:14,226
[SPEAKER_04]: We appreciate it.

1225
01:19:14,966 --> 01:19:15,206
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay.

1226
01:19:15,386 --> 01:19:16,066
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a super day.

1227
01:19:16,867 --> 01:19:17,407
[SPEAKER_27]: All right, you too.

1228
01:19:17,427 --> 01:19:17,527
[SPEAKER_27]: Later.

1229
01:19:17,547 --> 01:19:17,807
[SPEAKER_04]: Later.

1230
01:19:18,669 --> 01:19:21,250
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on, I have that Loki sound clip, you guys.

1231
01:19:21,650 --> 01:19:22,710
[SPEAKER_04]: God damn!

1232
01:19:23,690 --> 01:19:24,631
[SPEAKER_04]: Ow, my foot!

1233
01:19:24,671 --> 01:19:27,231
[SPEAKER_16]: Why did I shoot myself in my foot?

1234
01:19:27,611 --> 01:19:29,392
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god, it hurts so bad!

1235
01:19:29,792 --> 01:19:31,112
[SPEAKER_23]: I need that for walking!

1236
01:19:32,493 --> 01:19:33,553
[SPEAKER_07]: No, my foot!

1237
01:19:33,593 --> 01:19:34,773
[SPEAKER_07]: I need that for walking!

1238
01:19:36,834 --> 01:19:43,736
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to point out, somebody named Bomanikay just joined our chatroom, and I'm thinking, if you gave your computer to your sister,

1239
01:19:45,427 --> 01:19:46,928
[SPEAKER_23]: She's not joining the chatroom.

1240
01:19:46,948 --> 01:19:47,728
[SPEAKER_23]: She doesn't even know.

1241
01:19:47,928 --> 01:19:48,949
[SPEAKER_23]: She's on dial-up.

1242
01:19:48,989 --> 01:19:49,569
[SPEAKER_23]: Come on now.

1243
01:19:49,769 --> 01:19:53,831
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody named Bomanikay just joined the chatroom and says, Hi, Loki, we love you.

1244
01:19:56,192 --> 01:19:57,232
[SPEAKER_24]: It's not her.

1245
01:19:57,272 --> 01:19:57,772
[SPEAKER_24]: Trust me.

1246
01:19:59,793 --> 01:20:01,734
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I said, is that Loki's sister?

1247
01:20:01,774 --> 01:20:03,775
[SPEAKER_04]: And they said, yup, and family is listening.

1248
01:20:04,776 --> 01:20:05,616
[SPEAKER_23]: She is not.

1249
01:20:06,496 --> 01:20:07,377
[SPEAKER_23]: It is not her.

1250
01:20:07,477 --> 01:20:08,057
[SPEAKER_23]: Trust me.

1251
01:20:08,777 --> 01:20:11,999
[SPEAKER_23]: My family, first off, no, it's not even her.

1252
01:20:12,019 --> 01:20:12,339
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay.

1253
01:20:13,757 --> 01:20:16,139
[SPEAKER_04]: You are so screwed if that person's telling the truth.

1254
01:20:16,239 --> 01:20:17,079
[SPEAKER_23]: It is not her!

1255
01:20:17,680 --> 01:20:19,020
[SPEAKER_04]: They're telling me yes they do.

1256
01:20:19,761 --> 01:20:21,082
[SPEAKER_23]: No, it's not my sister.

1257
01:20:21,162 --> 01:20:24,784
[SPEAKER_23]: First off, okay, first off, she's on dial-up, okay?

1258
01:20:25,124 --> 01:20:27,586
[SPEAKER_04]: That's for one.

1259
01:20:27,826 --> 01:20:31,909
[SPEAKER_23]: And second, okay, she doesn't know how to use damn IRC anyway.

1260
01:20:32,109 --> 01:20:32,929
[SPEAKER_04]: What if she learned?

1261
01:20:33,510 --> 01:20:35,531
[SPEAKER_04]: She doesn't know how to use the internet?

1262
01:20:35,611 --> 01:20:36,432
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on now!

1263
01:20:37,372 --> 01:20:40,155
[SPEAKER_04]: She uses Juno to connect to the goddamn internet.

1264
01:20:40,815 --> 01:20:44,998
[SPEAKER_04]: But Monty Cade, you've got to say something that only Loki would know.

1265
01:20:45,199 --> 01:20:48,661
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I'm going to pee my pants laughing.

1266
01:20:48,802 --> 01:20:49,562
[SPEAKER_04]: I will say it on air.

1267
01:20:49,582 --> 01:20:52,184
[SPEAKER_04]: I am so drunk, I can't even see the chatroom.

1268
01:20:52,284 --> 01:20:54,146
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like a bunch of blurr.

1269
01:20:54,906 --> 01:20:59,350
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to finish my drink and get another one.

1270
01:20:59,650 --> 01:21:02,312
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not listening to me right now.

1271
01:21:02,352 --> 01:21:04,354
[SPEAKER_04]: They have better things to be... They've been watching like...

1272
01:21:04,634 --> 01:21:06,174
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's a movie or something.

1273
01:21:06,214 --> 01:21:08,135
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not listening to my goddamn show.

1274
01:21:09,715 --> 01:21:10,815
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't even... Okay.

1275
01:21:12,096 --> 01:21:13,276
[SPEAKER_04]: Where is the money?

1276
01:21:13,356 --> 01:21:14,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, go sit down.

1277
01:21:14,836 --> 01:21:17,717
[SPEAKER_04]: Mom, G-Ma, G-Pa, and Sis listening.

1278
01:21:22,358 --> 01:21:22,638
Oh, God.

1279
01:21:22,978 --> 01:21:23,718
I'm gonna cry.

1280
01:21:24,138 --> 01:21:24,738
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, you know what?

1281
01:21:24,758 --> 01:21:30,299
[SPEAKER_23]: That could be them because my grandma and grandpa are at my mom's house.

1282
01:21:30,359 --> 01:21:31,780
[SPEAKER_16]: You are so screwy.

1283
01:21:36,479 --> 01:21:38,819
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, if that's the case... Hello, family!

1284
01:21:39,239 --> 01:21:41,960
[SPEAKER_23]: I am drinking right now, and I am... But he's being responsible.

1285
01:21:41,980 --> 01:21:43,201
[SPEAKER_23]: He has a designated driver here.

1286
01:21:43,221 --> 01:21:47,302
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a designated driver, and I am... And this is all a rating stunt.

1287
01:21:47,362 --> 01:21:48,342
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, DarkSakura, get this.

1288
01:21:48,382 --> 01:21:50,163
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki's family is listening right now.

1289
01:21:51,103 --> 01:21:52,284
[SPEAKER_14]: Designated driver three.

1290
01:21:54,392 --> 01:21:54,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Ran-chan!

1291
01:21:54,672 --> 01:21:55,392
[SPEAKER_04]: Ran-chan!

1292
01:21:55,492 --> 01:21:56,013
[SPEAKER_14]: Ran-chan!

1293
01:21:56,053 --> 01:21:56,313
[SPEAKER_04]: Ran-chan!

1294
01:22:23,652 --> 01:22:25,594
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, Rook-chan, what is it?

1295
01:22:28,556 --> 01:22:30,138
[SPEAKER_10]: You are, you are tore up, aren't you?

1296
01:22:30,298 --> 01:22:30,558
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

1297
01:22:31,639 --> 01:22:31,939
[SPEAKER_02]: Liar.

1298
01:22:39,245 --> 01:22:40,426
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like so full.

1299
01:22:40,547 --> 01:22:47,332
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like I am full of food because I just ate like, you know, two meals and I've had about three or four drinks right now.

1300
01:22:47,713 --> 01:22:48,734
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, no, four drinks.

1301
01:22:49,614 --> 01:22:50,095
[SPEAKER_14]: I think.

1302
01:22:52,388 --> 01:23:03,941
[SPEAKER_04]: Hachi no nomimasu Wait, wait, wait, Loki Tudor train is the one you use to push in your power suit Oh my god

1303
01:23:12,702 --> 01:23:20,447
[SPEAKER_14]: I have no idea why liquor is making me speak in Japanese.

1304
01:23:20,527 --> 01:23:21,248
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to go get more.

1305
01:23:23,109 --> 01:23:23,889
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god.

1306
01:23:23,969 --> 01:23:24,570
[SPEAKER_04]: It's on your mind.

1307
01:23:25,748 --> 01:23:28,850
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, I just wanted to talk about the upcoming DOA movie real quick.

1308
01:23:29,451 --> 01:23:30,132
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm sorry.

1309
01:23:30,172 --> 01:23:31,933
[SPEAKER_02]: When are you going to come cosplay with me?

1310
01:23:32,914 --> 01:23:35,055
[SPEAKER_10]: As soon as I get enough money to come out there.

1311
01:23:35,836 --> 01:23:36,537
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, okay.

1312
01:23:36,597 --> 01:23:38,498
[SPEAKER_04]: Let Ranma talk about the Dead or Alive movie.

1313
01:23:38,518 --> 01:23:38,838
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up?

1314
01:23:38,858 --> 01:23:41,921
[SPEAKER_14]: You need to cosplay Manji for me so I can cosplay Rin.

1315
01:23:43,122 --> 01:23:44,283
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll think about it, okay?

1316
01:23:46,224 --> 01:23:49,427
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, um... Okay, on the podcast... Hold on, hold on.

1317
01:23:49,707 --> 01:23:53,110
[SPEAKER_04]: I can hear Loki ran outside to go tell... To go...

1318
01:23:54,631 --> 01:24:02,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki walked outside to tell Nelly something in the living room because Nelly's the designated driver tonight and I can hear Nelly laughing all the way back here.

1319
01:24:03,876 --> 01:24:05,977
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to go get more liquor and I'll be right back.

1320
01:24:06,017 --> 01:24:06,697
[SPEAKER_04]: Ranma, what's on your mind?

1321
01:24:07,458 --> 01:24:07,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Not much.

1322
01:24:08,158 --> 01:24:10,099
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to talk about the DOA movie.

1323
01:24:10,139 --> 01:24:10,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, the DOA movie.

1324
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:11,320
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up?

1325
01:24:12,020 --> 01:24:15,222
[SPEAKER_02]: The guy that's playing Ryu Hayabusa, Ken Kosugi.

1326
01:24:16,002 --> 01:24:17,563
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know who his father is?

1327
01:24:19,604 --> 01:24:20,164
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, what?

1328
01:24:20,184 --> 01:24:22,466
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know who his father is?

1329
01:24:22,566 --> 01:24:22,886
[SPEAKER_02]: No, who?

1330
01:24:24,139 --> 01:24:30,421
[SPEAKER_02]: Sho Kasugi, he did all those ninja movies from the 80s, and he also helped put together Tenchu.

1331
01:24:31,921 --> 01:24:33,902
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, you cut out there, he also helped put together what?

1332
01:24:34,622 --> 01:24:37,883
[SPEAKER_02]: He did the choreography for Tenchu, Stealth Assassins.

1333
01:24:38,383 --> 01:24:38,723
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

1334
01:24:39,803 --> 01:24:45,785
[SPEAKER_02]: I just posted a link about that, so, this guy plays on everything, so you know what?

1335
01:24:46,765 --> 01:24:49,146
[SPEAKER_02]: They got the perfect person to play Ryu, that's all.

1336
01:24:51,310 --> 01:24:52,371
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds awesome to me.

1337
01:24:52,771 --> 01:24:56,214
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking forward to the Dead or Alive movie, even though I'm not a huge fan of the games.

1338
01:24:56,634 --> 01:25:00,817
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm really hoping they don't screw one of those movies up.

1339
01:25:01,758 --> 01:25:02,278
[SPEAKER_02]: Same here.

1340
01:25:02,518 --> 01:25:07,842
[SPEAKER_02]: Last I heard about the movie, which was back in 2000-2001, William Shatner was supposed to be a part of it.

1341
01:25:07,922 --> 01:25:08,702
[SPEAKER_04]: Heck no.

1342
01:25:08,822 --> 01:25:09,543
[SPEAKER_04]: Heck no.

1343
01:25:09,843 --> 01:25:10,824
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad that didn't happen.

1344
01:25:11,744 --> 01:25:12,605
[SPEAKER_04]: You ain't the only one.

1345
01:25:13,706 --> 01:25:14,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Right on.

1346
01:25:14,166 --> 01:25:15,227
[SPEAKER_04]: What else is on your mind, Ranma?

1347
01:25:16,327 --> 01:25:16,887
[SPEAKER_02]: Not much.

1348
01:25:17,108 --> 01:25:19,169
[SPEAKER_02]: I just went to a convention a couple of weeks back.

1349
01:25:19,189 --> 01:25:23,070
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we had fun, got drunk, orgy, you know, the normal chaos.

1350
01:25:23,190 --> 01:25:23,591
[SPEAKER_04]: Hot!

1351
01:25:27,633 --> 01:25:28,793
[SPEAKER_04]: We have Matt's parents listening.

1352
01:25:28,893 --> 01:25:31,654
[SPEAKER_04]: Please don't say those types of things on air.

1353
01:25:31,694 --> 01:25:32,255
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not good.

1354
01:25:33,075 --> 01:25:33,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Like orgy?

1355
01:25:33,996 --> 01:25:34,896
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, don't say that word.

1356
01:25:34,976 --> 01:25:35,636
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a dirty word.

1357
01:25:36,477 --> 01:25:37,497
[SPEAKER_04]: So I can't say orgy anymore?

1358
01:25:37,537 --> 01:25:38,077
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you can't.

1359
01:25:38,498 --> 01:25:39,158
[SPEAKER_04]: It's banned tonight.

1360
01:25:41,997 --> 01:25:43,579
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if Loki's going to come back on air.

1361
01:25:43,619 --> 01:25:44,760
[SPEAKER_04]: I think he's too embarrassed.

1362
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:46,101
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, here he comes.

1363
01:25:46,401 --> 01:25:49,744
[SPEAKER_14]: They are actually listening.

1364
01:25:49,764 --> 01:25:50,624
[SPEAKER_14]: My purse is ringing.

1365
01:25:50,804 --> 01:25:53,567
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, they wanted to know where you went.

1366
01:25:56,129 --> 01:25:58,431
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they are actually listening to this show.

1367
01:25:58,691 --> 01:25:59,712
[SPEAKER_08]: They're all laughing at us.

1368
01:26:00,412 --> 01:26:01,213
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on, what, Nellie?

1369
01:26:02,068 --> 01:26:06,989
[SPEAKER_08]: I said I have Matt's sister on the phone and his whole family is laughing at him right now.

1370
01:26:07,369 --> 01:26:11,790
[SPEAKER_04]: Just think of this as a rite of passage.

1371
01:26:11,850 --> 01:26:14,571
[SPEAKER_04]: This is something that every young man must go through.

1372
01:26:16,351 --> 01:26:19,131
[SPEAKER_04]: When your mom finds out that you're a drunk on the internet.

1373
01:26:21,012 --> 01:26:23,812
[SPEAKER_02]: I want a copy of this show.

1374
01:26:23,852 --> 01:26:24,933
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll figure something out.

1375
01:26:25,653 --> 01:26:26,233
[SPEAKER_04]: Please do that.

1376
01:26:28,450 --> 01:26:29,850
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, Ranma, anything else on your mind?

1377
01:26:29,870 --> 01:26:31,331
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we've got to go and make fun of Loki.

1378
01:26:31,911 --> 01:26:32,191
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1379
01:26:32,971 --> 01:26:34,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a couple of drinks for me, okay?

1380
01:26:34,792 --> 01:26:35,172
[SPEAKER_02]: Will do.

1381
01:26:35,852 --> 01:26:36,532
[SPEAKER_02]: Have one for me.

1382
01:26:36,652 --> 01:26:40,673
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm on number nine, and I've got to go to the potty so bad.

1383
01:26:40,713 --> 01:26:41,674
[SPEAKER_04]: Give us a drink count.

1384
01:26:42,554 --> 01:26:45,015
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm on nine, Loki's on, he's got a full glass.

1385
01:26:45,035 --> 01:26:45,715
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even know.

1386
01:26:45,735 --> 01:26:46,615
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that seven and eight?

1387
01:26:46,915 --> 01:26:48,796
[SPEAKER_23]: I think that's like nine and ten.

1388
01:26:49,036 --> 01:26:50,836
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got another double shot, whatever that is.

1389
01:26:50,996 --> 01:26:54,177
[SPEAKER_04]: And DarkSakura, what drink number are you on, for those keeping count at home?

1390
01:26:55,137 --> 01:26:55,478
[SPEAKER_04]: Six.

1391
01:26:55,718 --> 01:26:56,738
[SPEAKER_04]: She's putting up six fingers.

1392
01:26:57,885 --> 01:27:00,187
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't believe that my family is listening to this.

1393
01:27:00,207 --> 01:27:01,388
[SPEAKER_04]: This is crazy.

1394
01:27:01,568 --> 01:27:06,911
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, the six is counting actual number of drinks, not counting shots.

1395
01:27:08,553 --> 01:27:10,054
[SPEAKER_04]: Why are people listening to me?

1396
01:27:10,134 --> 01:27:11,475
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's so crazy.

1397
01:27:11,635 --> 01:27:12,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Ranma, we gotta go.

1398
01:27:12,555 --> 01:27:13,676
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you are fucking hilarious.

1399
01:27:13,716 --> 01:27:14,437
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I am.

1400
01:27:14,457 --> 01:27:15,077
[SPEAKER_04]: Take care, my friend.

1401
01:27:15,698 --> 01:27:16,038
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye-bye.

1402
01:27:16,078 --> 01:27:16,378
[SPEAKER_14]: Bye.

1403
01:27:18,019 --> 01:27:19,180
[SPEAKER_14]: No, no, Ranchan can't go.

1404
01:27:19,200 --> 01:27:20,181
[SPEAKER_06]: I already hung up on him.

1405
01:27:20,201 --> 01:27:20,541
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

1406
01:27:20,661 --> 01:27:21,882
[SPEAKER_14]: Ranchan has to come back.

1407
01:27:22,943 --> 01:27:23,763
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, what do you want to tell him?

1408
01:27:23,783 --> 01:27:24,224
[SPEAKER_06]: He's listening.

1409
01:27:25,825 --> 01:27:26,085
[SPEAKER_14]: Nothing.

1410
01:27:27,116 --> 01:27:30,100
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright, so about those, you know, dancing games.

1411
01:27:31,422 --> 01:27:33,305
[SPEAKER_14]: Ah, who fucking plays those anymore?

1412
01:27:36,547 --> 01:27:48,397
[SPEAKER_14]: I have to go over to my mom's house tomorrow to actually do Fourth of July stuff.

1413
01:27:48,597 --> 01:27:53,841
[SPEAKER_04]: We're actually outstanding citizens of the community and we do charity work and all that, don't we?

1414
01:27:54,342 --> 01:27:54,682
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1415
01:27:55,262 --> 01:27:55,983
[SPEAKER_04]: I did charity work.

1416
01:27:56,003 --> 01:27:57,504
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, you can turn the speaker down now.

1417
01:27:57,644 --> 01:27:58,145
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, sorry.

1418
01:27:58,305 --> 01:28:03,549
[SPEAKER_04]: All I got to say right now is for some reason my hand is numb and I don't know why that is.

1419
01:28:03,629 --> 01:28:04,650
[SPEAKER_04]: My lips are numb.

1420
01:28:05,365 --> 01:28:08,466
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have a full drink here, so I've got to finish that.

1421
01:28:09,866 --> 01:28:10,286
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1422
01:28:11,166 --> 01:28:13,767
[SPEAKER_14]: I mixed Loki a super yummy drink.

1423
01:28:13,807 --> 01:28:15,987
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank God I have a designated driver.

1424
01:28:16,287 --> 01:28:20,248
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, again, boys and girls, if you are going to drink, have a designated driver.

1425
01:28:20,608 --> 01:28:22,029
[SPEAKER_04]: We were model citizens.

1426
01:28:22,049 --> 01:28:28,050
[SPEAKER_14]: No, no, no, no, you were wrong, DTE, because I have had six actual drinks.

1427
01:28:29,258 --> 01:28:35,460
[SPEAKER_14]: I've had one, two beers, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

1428
01:28:36,101 --> 01:28:38,542
[SPEAKER_14]: I have had ten shots, including my beers.

1429
01:28:39,382 --> 01:28:39,982
[SPEAKER_04]: That's great.

1430
01:28:40,062 --> 01:28:41,963
[SPEAKER_04]: I get to go face my family tomorrow.

1431
01:28:42,143 --> 01:28:42,583
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.

1432
01:28:42,643 --> 01:28:43,203
[SPEAKER_04]: So fix it!

1433
01:28:46,520 --> 01:28:48,562
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for watching!

1434
01:29:06,514 --> 01:29:07,735
[SPEAKER_23]: All right, here you go.

1435
01:29:08,816 --> 01:29:09,177
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, man.

1436
01:29:09,217 --> 01:29:11,099
[SPEAKER_14]: Now that you're not spilling it all over the damn kitchen.

1437
01:29:11,219 --> 01:29:13,401
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm not spilling anything, okay?

1438
01:29:13,761 --> 01:29:14,462
[SPEAKER_14]: It's actually pretty good.

1439
01:29:14,502 --> 01:29:17,085
[SPEAKER_14]: You did, too, freaking spill it all over the damn kitchen.

1440
01:29:17,105 --> 01:29:24,532
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, but... Because poor Exifer was down there with a towel on his hands and knees scrubbing up after your freaking...

1441
01:29:25,393 --> 01:29:29,155
[SPEAKER_04]: SloshyLickerAss Listen, I brought the towel with me, okay?

1442
01:29:29,175 --> 01:29:30,316
[SPEAKER_04]: I brought the paper towel with me.

1443
01:29:30,336 --> 01:29:31,776
[SPEAKER_04]: You brought one with you.

1444
01:29:31,836 --> 01:29:32,517
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, okay, okay.

1445
01:29:32,557 --> 01:29:32,917
[SPEAKER_14]: No, no, no.

1446
01:29:32,977 --> 01:29:34,037
[SPEAKER_14]: Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck that.

1447
01:29:34,878 --> 01:29:37,959
[SPEAKER_14]: You had the towel with you in here.

1448
01:29:38,300 --> 01:29:40,901
[SPEAKER_14]: You were spilling freaking orange juice all over the goddamn floor.

1449
01:29:41,221 --> 01:29:48,525
[SPEAKER_14]: And if orange juice left unchecked, it tends to mutate and collect dust buddies, which turn into a huge fucking mess.

1450
01:29:49,385 --> 01:29:50,566
[SPEAKER_23]: Okie dokie.

1451
01:29:51,186 --> 01:29:52,387
[SPEAKER_14]: So you, sir...

1452
01:29:53,479 --> 01:29:59,447
[SPEAKER_14]: Build the orange juice on the floor And it's not for the valiant Can we move on?

1453
01:30:00,329 --> 01:30:07,519
[SPEAKER_14]: I am not done It's not for the valiant efforts of your roommate, Rob Extifer

1454
01:30:07,918 --> 01:30:08,118
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1455
01:30:08,739 --> 01:30:13,383
[SPEAKER_14]: There would be, you would be stepping in quagmire every time you entered the kitchen.

1456
01:30:14,443 --> 01:30:16,525
[SPEAKER_14]: Something along the lines of my ex-partner.

1457
01:30:17,446 --> 01:30:17,986
[SPEAKER_24]: Quagmire.

1458
01:30:18,267 --> 01:30:23,511
[SPEAKER_13]: Can we, can we please... Hey, we should go... Ride green pong!

1459
01:30:23,531 --> 01:30:26,133
[SPEAKER_04]: Your sister says, have fun, Orange Lounge.

1460
01:30:26,273 --> 01:30:26,894
[SPEAKER_04]: Be safe.

1461
01:30:27,174 --> 01:30:28,175
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye, your family.

1462
01:30:28,275 --> 01:30:29,055
[SPEAKER_04]: See you on the 4th.

1463
01:30:31,137 --> 01:30:33,019
[SPEAKER_04]: Why are they listening to this show?

1464
01:30:34,144 --> 01:30:35,346
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at it this way.

1465
01:30:35,426 --> 01:30:36,327
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at it this way.

1466
01:30:36,347 --> 01:30:37,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki's family out there listening.

1467
01:30:47,881 --> 01:30:51,184
[SPEAKER_04]: There are many, many worse things that Loki could be doing right now.

1468
01:30:51,244 --> 01:30:52,344
[SPEAKER_04]: He doesn't do drugs.

1469
01:30:52,625 --> 01:30:55,007
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a drug-free American citizen.

1470
01:30:55,067 --> 01:30:57,168
[SPEAKER_04]: I only drink on pretty weekends.

1471
01:30:57,188 --> 01:30:59,730
[SPEAKER_04]: He provides a service to the youth of America.

1472
01:31:00,371 --> 01:31:02,172
[SPEAKER_04]: He teaches them to stay in school.

1473
01:31:03,553 --> 01:31:03,953
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

1474
01:31:04,494 --> 01:31:06,455
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, if they don't want to end up like me.

1475
01:31:08,837 --> 01:31:09,177
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1476
01:31:10,714 --> 01:31:12,715
[SPEAKER_04]: I've really got to go to the bathroom.

1477
01:31:12,755 --> 01:31:13,955
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to go to a cage match.

1478
01:31:14,095 --> 01:31:16,456
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, we're going to go to a cage match and then we'll come back and we'll take more time.

1479
01:31:16,716 --> 01:31:20,657
[SPEAKER_14]: I won last week's win, win, win, win, win, win.

1480
01:31:20,877 --> 01:31:22,277
[SPEAKER_14]: Win, win, win, win.

1481
01:31:22,598 --> 01:31:23,598
[SPEAKER_04]: We're getting one more call.

1482
01:31:23,858 --> 01:31:26,139
[SPEAKER_04]: This is from a new listener, so we'll go ahead and take this call.

1483
01:31:26,699 --> 01:31:28,699
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we like it when new people call in.

1484
01:31:28,719 --> 01:31:30,880
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1485
01:31:32,080 --> 01:31:32,540
Hey, what's up?

1486
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:33,401
This is DeepThought42.

1487
01:31:33,521 --> 01:31:36,301
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh, you're very, very quiet on there, DeepThought42.

1488
01:31:36,361 --> 01:31:38,282
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there any way you can talk into your microphone a little more?

1489
01:31:39,419 --> 01:31:39,779
[SPEAKER_25]: Hold on.

1490
01:31:40,120 --> 01:31:40,340
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1491
01:31:41,441 --> 01:31:42,701
[SPEAKER_25]: What should I hold on to?

1492
01:31:42,721 --> 01:31:43,602
[SPEAKER_04]: A little, little bit.

1493
01:31:43,702 --> 01:31:44,182
[SPEAKER_04]: Talk again.

1494
01:31:45,503 --> 01:31:46,164
[SPEAKER_25]: Hold on one second.

1495
01:31:46,464 --> 01:31:46,684
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1496
01:31:47,264 --> 01:31:48,745
[SPEAKER_04]: He's very, very quiet, boys and girls.

1497
01:31:48,765 --> 01:31:49,286
[SPEAKER_04]: We're sorry.

1498
01:31:50,046 --> 01:31:51,987
[SPEAKER_14]: It's always the quiet ones you gotta watch out for.

1499
01:31:52,027 --> 01:31:54,569
[SPEAKER_04]: We can barely hear you, my friend.

1500
01:31:57,611 --> 01:31:57,951
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello?

1501
01:31:57,971 --> 01:32:03,755
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you might have turned off the... No, just give him a moment to adjust.

1502
01:32:05,036 --> 01:32:06,617
[SPEAKER_04]: See, I can hear you just as loud as I can hear him.

1503
01:32:08,394 --> 01:32:08,834
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's right.

1504
01:32:09,654 --> 01:32:13,115
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll give you a tip in the chat room, and then why don't you call us back after the cage match, alright?

1505
01:32:13,455 --> 01:32:14,175
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, thanks.

1506
01:32:14,335 --> 01:32:14,995
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, later.

1507
01:32:15,236 --> 01:32:15,576
[SPEAKER_04]: Later.

1508
01:32:16,476 --> 01:32:17,556
[SPEAKER_04]: I can hear myself on there.

1509
01:32:17,576 --> 01:32:18,216
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of weird.

1510
01:32:18,356 --> 01:32:19,076
[SPEAKER_04]: He's very quiet.

1511
01:32:19,096 --> 01:32:20,537
[SPEAKER_06]: He's got a very low delay.

1512
01:32:20,557 --> 01:32:21,857
[SPEAKER_06]: Turn the microphone down.

1513
01:32:21,877 --> 01:32:22,697
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, I'm trying to get down.

1514
01:32:22,837 --> 01:32:23,777
[SPEAKER_06]: You're giving me a freaking headache.

1515
01:32:23,797 --> 01:32:24,218
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

1516
01:32:24,258 --> 01:32:26,638
[SPEAKER_14]: He's got a very small delay, though.

1517
01:32:26,658 --> 01:32:29,419
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, he must have a fast... He has to be near to us.

1518
01:32:29,479 --> 01:32:33,199
[SPEAKER_04]: He must have a fast internet connection, so... Everything's spinning.

1519
01:32:33,260 --> 01:32:35,220
[SPEAKER_04]: That's... fun.

1520
01:32:36,292 --> 01:32:36,752
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what?

1521
01:32:36,772 --> 01:32:37,592
[SPEAKER_14]: You're fucked up.

1522
01:32:37,752 --> 01:32:39,493
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm, like, not even half there.

1523
01:32:40,093 --> 01:32:40,553
[SPEAKER_14]: So, whatever.

1524
01:32:40,573 --> 01:32:41,213
[SPEAKER_23]: No, that's okay.

1525
01:32:41,594 --> 01:32:42,954
[SPEAKER_23]: I still have to finish my drink.

1526
01:32:42,994 --> 01:32:47,995
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I need to save room in my liquor tolerance for the club tonight, so I can get my hoe on.

1527
01:32:48,035 --> 01:32:56,818
[SPEAKER_23]: I think this is the most drunk-ness I've been, you know, because honestly, when I was at my San Diego... I'm already sobering up, so it doesn't even matter.

1528
01:32:56,838 --> 01:33:04,260
[SPEAKER_04]: When I was at my San Diego event, you know, I thought I was pretty drunk, but this is pretty bad, because, I mean, like, I actually feel like I'm gonna, like, fall over and just

1529
01:33:07,255 --> 01:33:12,917
[SPEAKER_04]: We really need to go to a cage match, kids, because I've got to pee, or I'm going to pee my pants right here in the studio, and you don't want that.

1530
01:33:12,937 --> 01:33:15,038
[SPEAKER_04]: I brought my, um, zip drive here.

1531
01:33:15,078 --> 01:33:16,659
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go, let's stop tonight's cage match.

1532
01:33:17,999 --> 01:33:18,759
[SPEAKER_04]: There it is.

1533
01:33:18,819 --> 01:33:19,280
[SPEAKER_04]: I love Kotaku!

1534
01:33:23,855 --> 01:33:24,355
[SPEAKER_04]: Alex!

1535
01:33:24,415 --> 01:33:29,077
[SPEAKER_04]: The way the case works, three songs we're going to play for you guys.

1536
01:33:29,297 --> 01:33:30,338
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to play for you guys.

1537
01:33:30,358 --> 01:33:39,562
[SPEAKER_04]: You get to vote for your favorite, and the winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio Live's Milani Music and More program, which plays 24 hours a day, 70 days a week.

1538
01:33:39,782 --> 01:33:41,803
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically, we're going to play three songs to vote for your favorite.

1539
01:33:41,863 --> 01:33:43,624
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how it works.

1540
01:33:43,704 --> 01:33:44,684
[SPEAKER_04]: It's totally you guys.

1541
01:33:44,704 --> 01:33:45,444
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys get control.

1542
01:33:45,504 --> 01:33:46,945
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know we have new listeners tonight.

1543
01:33:47,165 --> 01:33:48,806
[SPEAKER_04]: Only votes for Loki count.

1544
01:33:49,626 --> 01:33:50,847
[SPEAKER_04]: No, shh, don't tell them that.

1545
01:33:50,927 --> 01:33:57,491
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so you only get to hear a clip of the song that won from last week, because you already heard it last week.

1546
01:33:57,591 --> 01:34:03,714
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though I know we have new listeners tonight, thanks to the great Apple, we're only playing a clip.

1547
01:34:04,074 --> 01:34:05,175
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm so gone.

1548
01:34:05,215 --> 01:34:08,337
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, you are so freaking drunk right now, it's not even funny.

1549
01:34:09,237 --> 01:34:13,480
[SPEAKER_14]: Ah, no, no, no, no, no, he's not, I have to make him the mother of all drinks.

1550
01:34:13,920 --> 01:34:18,004
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember, you cannot vote until all three songs have played in their entirety.

1551
01:34:18,024 --> 01:34:21,066
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel sorry for Christopher's desk, because it's probably getting messed up for me.

1552
01:34:21,247 --> 01:34:22,267
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.

1553
01:34:22,508 --> 01:34:24,950
[SPEAKER_04]: Song number one, it's last week's winner.

1554
01:34:25,130 --> 01:34:27,992
[SPEAKER_04]: Or two weeks ago, really, because we didn't have a show last week.

1555
01:34:28,032 --> 01:34:31,956
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura picked Del the Funky Homo Sapien with Dr. Bombay.

1556
01:34:32,336 --> 01:34:33,898
[SPEAKER_04]: That's because that song's fucking awesome.

1557
01:34:33,918 --> 01:34:34,919
[SPEAKER_04]: So see if you like it.

1558
01:34:34,959 --> 01:34:35,679
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the clip.

1559
01:34:35,779 --> 01:34:37,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Song number one you can vote for tonight.

1560
01:34:37,241 --> 01:34:39,823
[SPEAKER_04]: Del the Funky Homo Sapien, Dr. Bombay.

1561
01:36:57,657 --> 01:37:05,361
[SPEAKER_15]: And get up off your knees, everything that Dr. Bombay says It's guaranteed to make you say, so who's the side to hit?

1562
01:37:05,441 --> 01:37:26,490
[SPEAKER_15]: I like little men hanging out with the damn thing Girl, if you ain't got a turn, I won't hesitate to pull out my funky ones But if you ain't down for jump on, cancel your appointment and please get the hell on Cause I won't have fun with fools under my nose if you want 80 feet to close Get out my way so I can save the day, cause I'm Dr. Bombay

1563
01:38:05,467 --> 01:38:07,651
[SPEAKER_04]: Yo, that was song number one.

1564
01:38:07,691 --> 01:38:09,053
[SPEAKER_04]: Song number one tonight's cage match.

1565
01:38:09,373 --> 01:38:10,155
[SPEAKER_04]: Dell the Funky.

1566
01:38:12,659 --> 01:38:13,860
[SPEAKER_04]: We're talking about Del!

1567
01:38:14,080 --> 01:38:16,662
[SPEAKER_04]: Del the Funky Homo Sapien with Dr. Bombay.

1568
01:38:16,942 --> 01:38:18,223
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob is done with his pee.

1569
01:38:18,403 --> 01:38:19,984
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to take the biggest pee, you guys.

1570
01:38:20,564 --> 01:38:21,685
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even know if I flushed.

1571
01:38:21,725 --> 01:38:22,365
[SPEAKER_04]: I was so drunk.

1572
01:38:22,405 --> 01:38:22,806
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I did.

1573
01:38:22,926 --> 01:38:23,526
[SPEAKER_04]: I did, kids.

1574
01:38:23,586 --> 01:38:24,146
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sanitary.

1575
01:38:24,607 --> 01:38:24,907
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1576
01:38:26,308 --> 01:38:29,330
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's Del the Funky Homo Sapien with Dr. Bombay.

1577
01:38:29,430 --> 01:38:30,471
[SPEAKER_04]: So see if you like that one.

1578
01:38:30,491 --> 01:38:31,271
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's song number two.

1579
01:38:31,351 --> 01:38:33,112
[SPEAKER_04]: Song number two tonight is my pick.

1580
01:38:33,593 --> 01:38:35,674
[SPEAKER_04]: And you might remember last week we announced

1581
01:38:35,774 --> 01:38:36,114
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you Elijah?

1582
01:39:01,283 --> 01:39:04,346
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so precious!

1583
01:39:04,786 --> 01:39:08,329
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so I wanted to play an azoic song for you guys, because it's kind of gothy.

1584
01:39:08,489 --> 01:39:08,969
[SPEAKER_04]: I like it.

1585
01:39:09,250 --> 01:39:09,930
[SPEAKER_04]: I like this band.

1586
01:39:10,050 --> 01:39:10,931
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so too gothy.

1587
01:39:11,151 --> 01:39:12,892
[SPEAKER_04]: It's gothy, and we're going to the gothy club tonight.

1588
01:39:13,053 --> 01:39:14,093
[SPEAKER_04]: I gotta find something to wear, though.

1589
01:39:14,474 --> 01:39:15,134
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyway, here it is.

1590
01:39:16,035 --> 01:39:16,515
[SPEAKER_04]: Should I wear this?

1591
01:39:16,535 --> 01:39:17,997
[SPEAKER_13]: I am as real as this!

1592
01:39:18,537 --> 01:39:19,598
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright, here we go.

1593
01:39:19,698 --> 01:39:20,979
[SPEAKER_13]: It's so sorrow!

1594

[SPEAKER_22]: Song number two tonight, the azoic, Let Me Tell You Something.

1595
01:39:24,062 --> 01:39:24,282

01:39:57,760 --> 01:39:59,181
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks for watching!

1597
01:40:43,888 --> 01:40:45,929
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft,

1598
01:41:53,174 --> 01:41:55,616
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for watching!

1599
01:42:41,923 --> 01:42:42,984
Thank you for watching.

1600
01:42:43,124 --> 01:42:43,824
See you next time.

1601
01:43:10,200 --> 01:43:14,986
Come get to me Let me tell you something That won't be pushed around

1602
01:44:11,846 --> 01:44:14,527
[SPEAKER_04]: Song number two, The Ezoic, Let Me Tell You Something.

1603
01:44:14,927 --> 01:44:18,809
[SPEAKER_04]: And let me tell you, I don't know if these two heard much of that song, but they'll give it a rating anyway.

1604
01:44:18,849 --> 01:44:19,729
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.

1605
01:44:21,510 --> 01:44:23,671
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the same fucking stuff you always pick.

1606
01:44:24,631 --> 01:44:25,852
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't, I think you're wrong.

1607
01:44:25,952 --> 01:44:26,612
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's different.

1608
01:44:26,692 --> 01:44:32,695
[SPEAKER_14]: Tindy voice, tindy voice and trance, over generic beat, trance.

1609
01:44:32,755 --> 01:44:35,636
[SPEAKER_04]: I think if you put that side by side with my previous picks, the song's very different.

1610
01:44:35,996 --> 01:44:37,357
[SPEAKER_14]: It's actually okay and I give it a seven.

1611
01:44:38,257 --> 01:44:40,098
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, she just wanted to make fun of me.

1612
01:44:40,758 --> 01:44:43,674
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll give it a 9 because

1613
01:44:44,961 --> 01:44:49,164
[SPEAKER_07]: I wasn't here to listen to it, but it sounds great.

1614
01:44:49,684 --> 01:44:51,446
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the drunkest I've ever seen Loki.

1615
01:44:51,906 --> 01:44:52,907
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm gonna make him drunk.

1616
01:44:52,987 --> 01:44:55,128
[SPEAKER_04]: I could have played Britney Spears and that would have gotten a 9.

1617
01:44:55,428 --> 01:44:57,410
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't even know what the hell you played.

1618
01:44:57,770 --> 01:44:59,171
[SPEAKER_04]: It's gonna get a 9, though.

1619
01:44:59,251 --> 01:45:00,932
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the Azoic, let me tell you something.

1620
01:45:01,153 --> 01:45:01,913
[SPEAKER_04]: Azoic is good.

1621
01:45:02,053 --> 01:45:06,216
[SPEAKER_04]: I was listening to the different drum stuff earlier today when I was trying to find something to play.

1622
01:45:06,857 --> 01:45:09,999
[SPEAKER_24]: But, um, Azoic is good, so I'll give you a 9.

1623
01:45:10,399 --> 01:45:11,500
[SPEAKER_24]: Because Azoic rocks.

1624
01:45:11,980 --> 01:45:14,060
[SPEAKER_04]: and I give that song eleventy billion.

1625
01:45:14,521 --> 01:45:15,541
[SPEAKER_23]: Eleventy billion!

1626
01:45:16,061 --> 01:45:16,861
[SPEAKER_23]: I second that.

1627
01:45:16,941 --> 01:45:18,201
[SPEAKER_04]: Eleventy billion is good.

1628
01:45:18,301 --> 01:45:19,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Eleventy billion for the Ezoic.

1629
01:45:20,182 --> 01:45:21,042
[SPEAKER_23]: Eleventy billion.

1630
01:45:21,462 --> 01:45:23,522
[SPEAKER_23]: Honestly, Ezoic needs more stuff.

1631
01:45:23,563 --> 01:45:34,925
[SPEAKER_04]: There's actually, there's another group that I need, um, music from, but they only had one minute samplers on their site, and it begins with an E, but I can't remember the goddamn name of the stupid band.

1632
01:45:36,645 --> 01:45:37,005
[SPEAKER_04]: Emo?

1633
01:45:37,706 --> 01:45:38,566
[SPEAKER_24]: No, it's not Emo.

1634
01:45:38,646 --> 01:45:39,146
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, um...

1635
01:45:40,447 --> 01:45:40,808
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1636
01:45:41,148 --> 01:45:41,609
[SPEAKER_04]: Something else.

1637
01:45:41,689 --> 01:45:42,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Who cares?

1638
01:45:42,611 --> 01:45:43,292
[SPEAKER_04]: Song number three.

1639
01:45:43,613 --> 01:45:44,053
[SPEAKER_04]: Your pick.

1640
01:45:44,174 --> 01:45:45,215
[SPEAKER_04]: What'd you pick for us, Loki?

1641
01:45:46,077 --> 01:45:50,324
[SPEAKER_04]: Something from Every Little Thing is from ELT Trance.

1642
01:45:51,721 --> 01:45:52,941
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't remember what the guy's name is.

1643
01:45:52,961 --> 01:45:55,802
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called Feel My Heart, the Mugwai Remix.

1644
01:45:55,842 --> 01:46:01,184
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Feel My Heart, the Mugwai Remix, and it was just kind of cool sounding from what I had.

1645
01:46:01,684 --> 01:46:20,230
[SPEAKER_04]: I had another ELT Trance song that was kind of rock sounding, but it wasn't good enough, so I picked this one, and honestly, right now, I am in no condition to say how good the song was, but I think it was pretty good, so take a listen and enjoy.

1646
01:46:21,658 --> 01:46:22,420
[SPEAKER_04]: I might throw up.

1647
01:46:22,500 --> 01:46:23,283
[SPEAKER_04]: This isn't good.

1648
01:46:23,503 --> 01:46:24,245
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, here we go.

1649
01:46:24,586 --> 01:46:25,910
[SPEAKER_04]: Song number three, every little thing.

1650
01:46:26,210 --> 01:46:26,952
[SPEAKER_16]: Woo!

1651
01:46:27,213 --> 01:46:27,474
[SPEAKER_16]: Woo!

1652
01:47:58,533 --> 01:47:59,695
Thanks for watching!

1653
01:48:42,506 --> 01:48:43,487
Thank you for watching!

1654
01:49:44,481 --> 01:49:45,322
Thank you for watching!

1655
01:50:23,393 --> 01:50:30,915
[SPEAKER_04]: Song number three in tonight's cage match, Every Little Thing, Feel My Heart, the Mugwai remix.

1656
01:50:32,235 --> 01:50:37,157
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see what our people in the room thought about Every Little Thing, Feel My Heart.

1657
01:50:37,997 --> 01:50:39,457
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, Every Little Thing.

1658
01:50:39,657 --> 01:50:39,978
[SPEAKER_04]: Two.

1659
01:50:40,938 --> 01:50:41,438
[SPEAKER_04]: Why is that?

1660
01:50:46,423 --> 01:50:53,491
[SPEAKER_24]: I give it a, um, I don't know, a five?

1661
01:50:54,271 --> 01:50:57,515
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really know because I wasn't listening to it because I was drunk.

1662
01:50:59,285 --> 01:51:06,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, the parts I heard sounded neat, but you guys are giving it really low scores, I wouldn't have given it low scores.

1663
01:51:06,148 --> 01:51:14,451
[SPEAKER_23]: It was a pretty good song, I mean, I liked it when I originally picked it out when I was sober, and it was good, okay, that was pretty good.

1664
01:51:14,791 --> 01:51:18,413
[SPEAKER_23]: The original song I had picked out wasn't quite as good, so I'll give it an 8.

1665
01:51:19,778 --> 01:51:29,102
[SPEAKER_23]: But, um, right now, you could play it like, you know, a cat in heat, you know, a sound effect of that, and I would probably give it a 10.

1666
01:51:29,282 --> 01:51:29,582
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

1667
01:51:29,622 --> 01:51:31,123
[SPEAKER_23]: Because I'm just so gone.

1668
01:51:31,143 --> 01:51:35,165
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'll combine 2 plus 5 and give it a 7, because I kind of like that.

1669
01:51:35,265 --> 01:51:36,205
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1670
01:51:36,485 --> 01:51:39,587
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's listen to three songs you can vote for tonight.

1671
01:51:39,907 --> 01:51:40,647
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, here it is.

1672
01:51:40,967 --> 01:51:44,289
[SPEAKER_04]: Song number one you can vote for tonight, Del the Funky Homo Sapien.

1673
01:51:44,309 --> 01:51:45,929
[SPEAKER_04]: We played three songs already?

1674
01:51:45,949 --> 01:51:46,890
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's already done.

1675
01:51:47,150 --> 01:51:49,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Del the Funky Homo Sapien, Dr. Bombay.

1676
01:51:57,330 --> 01:51:59,832
[SPEAKER_04]: Every time I hear that song, I can't help but think, check and turn.

1677
01:52:01,714 --> 01:52:03,255
[SPEAKER_04]: Here it is, song number two tonight.

1678
01:52:03,535 --> 01:52:04,777
[SPEAKER_04]: Zoic, Let Me Tell You Something.

1679
01:52:13,364 --> 01:52:19,269
[SPEAKER_04]: And song number three you can vote for tonight, Every Little Thing, Feel My Heart, the Mugwai remix.

1680
01:52:22,332 --> 01:52:24,814
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope they're not dragging me out of here tonight.

1681
01:52:26,533 --> 01:52:28,775
[SPEAKER_04]: Place vote now.

1682
01:52:28,915 --> 01:52:34,298
[SPEAKER_04]: Send a private message to Sky in the chatroom with your vote and we'll tally them up.

1683
01:52:34,358 --> 01:52:35,840
[SPEAKER_04]: And hopefully I can keep count tonight.

1684
01:52:36,840 --> 01:52:37,681
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll tally them up.

1685
01:52:38,061 --> 01:52:43,985
[SPEAKER_04]: Please don't post a vote publicly because I don't see those as easily and then I don't tabulate it.

1686
01:52:44,105 --> 01:52:46,427
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's no fun at all when I can't tabulate your vote.

1687
01:52:47,047 --> 01:52:49,369
[SPEAKER_04]: So, how's it going there, Sky?

1688
01:52:50,610 --> 01:52:51,510
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm feeling okay.

1689
01:52:51,631 --> 01:52:53,432
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just... I'm a little...

1690
01:52:54,862 --> 01:53:01,684
[SPEAKER_23]: I have no sense of balance right now and I'm pretty drunk, I think.

1691
01:53:02,464 --> 01:53:03,004
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, me too.

1692
01:53:03,324 --> 01:53:04,644
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm pretty out of it.

1693
01:53:05,345 --> 01:53:10,746
[SPEAKER_23]: I can't focus on you right now, man, because you're all over the place.

1694
01:53:12,566 --> 01:53:16,567
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, I think my family stopped listening, so that's good.

1695
01:53:16,587 --> 01:53:17,447
[SPEAKER_03]: That's probably a good thing.

1696
01:53:17,528 --> 01:53:18,728
[SPEAKER_23]: That's probably a good thing.

1697
01:53:19,568 --> 01:53:23,349
[SPEAKER_23]: And I'm sure I'll get much crap for it tomorrow, but you know what?

1698
01:53:24,226 --> 01:53:28,637
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't care because I'm having a barbecue and it's free food and you know what?

1699
01:53:29,580 --> 01:53:30,221
[SPEAKER_23]: That's all good.

1700
01:53:33,570 --> 01:53:35,492
[SPEAKER_04]: I am so dizzy right now.

1701
01:53:36,413 --> 01:53:39,536
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, I honestly am at the point where I'm like, what do I do with the rest of the show?

1702
01:53:39,617 --> 01:53:44,101
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I could literally run into the wall and I wouldn't feel it because I'm so numb right now.

1703
01:53:44,221 --> 01:53:45,663
[SPEAKER_04]: I was hugging the corner earlier.

1704
01:53:45,703 --> 01:53:47,905
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why, I just felt very comfortable in my head.

1705
01:53:48,346 --> 01:53:50,108
[SPEAKER_04]: My head rested very well in the corner.

1706
01:53:50,128 --> 01:53:51,169
[SPEAKER_23]: It was very interesting.

1707
01:53:51,189 --> 01:53:52,070
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, I saw that.

1708
01:53:52,290 --> 01:53:52,890
[SPEAKER_23]: I saw that.

1709
01:53:53,351 --> 01:53:56,094
[SPEAKER_23]: And people were saying, you know, you're so drunk.

1710
01:53:57,667 --> 01:54:03,772
[SPEAKER_23]: Honestly, folks, I am pretty drunk, but I am still pretty coherent.

1711
01:54:03,992 --> 01:54:12,378
[SPEAKER_23]: I just have no sense of balance whatsoever right now in most of my... Whoa, we're getting feedback, but we're going to try and take this call.

1712
01:54:12,419 --> 01:54:13,199
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange House Radio.

1713
01:54:15,290 --> 01:54:15,670
[SPEAKER_25]: Sorry about that.

1714
01:54:15,690 --> 01:54:16,230
[SPEAKER_25]: Can you hear me now?

1715
01:54:16,530 --> 01:54:16,751
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1716
01:54:18,651 --> 01:54:19,311
[SPEAKER_25]: It's DeepFell42.

1717
01:54:19,331 --> 01:54:20,672
[SPEAKER_25]: Sorry about that earlier.

1718
01:54:21,072 --> 01:54:21,512
[SPEAKER_25]: That's all right.

1719
01:54:21,532 --> 01:54:22,112
[SPEAKER_25]: What's on your mind?

1720
01:54:22,152 --> 01:54:25,854
[SPEAKER_25]: We're hearing a bad echo, so I'm just going to give you a minute to put out your thoughts.

1721
01:54:25,894 --> 01:54:27,874
[SPEAKER_25]: That was because I forgot to turn my iTunes volume down.

1722
01:54:28,935 --> 01:54:30,535
[SPEAKER_25]: So that was the main reason of that.

1723
01:54:31,876 --> 01:54:32,336
[SPEAKER_04]: What's on your mind?

1724
01:54:32,376 --> 01:54:32,956
[SPEAKER_04]: What's on your mind?

1725
01:54:33,376 --> 01:54:41,699
[SPEAKER_25]: No, I just wanted to let you guys know that if you go to KevinPereira.com, I wanted to let you know how to vote for you guys for Attack of the Show.

1726
01:54:42,599 --> 01:54:42,819
[SPEAKER_19]: Awesome.

1727
01:54:43,019 --> 01:54:44,800
[SPEAKER_25]: If you go to KevinPereira.com

1728
01:54:45,786 --> 01:55:14,377
[SPEAKER_25]: he has a private webcast called Attack of the Webcast sorry, Attack of the Podcast the ingenious clever man that he is naming it that so if you go on and that's where I heard about it if you guys go on to attackoftheshow.com if you go on to their comment section you can fill out comments and how to improve the show and just tell them I just told them that these guys have this great you know

1729
01:55:14,892 --> 01:55:15,692
[SPEAKER_25]: I really appreciate it.

1730
01:55:15,752 --> 01:55:16,152
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm so grateful.

1731
01:55:43,701 --> 01:55:56,712
[SPEAKER_25]: So, I mean, just, I mean, so, everybody go to, well, first of all, if you want to go to Kevin Pereira's Self-Indulgent Crap, just go on to, I think his podcast is registered with iTunes as well.

1732
01:55:57,232 --> 01:56:06,980
[SPEAKER_25]: It's called Attack of the Podcast, and you guys would, you guys just would be so awesome, because ever since it went to Attack of the Show, it's been crap.

1733
01:56:07,460 --> 01:56:10,943
[SPEAKER_25]: Sorry, we weren't listening to you so much that break, because Jamie was modeling for us.

1734
01:56:10,963 --> 01:56:11,564
[SPEAKER_17]: She was so weird.

1735
01:56:15,284 --> 01:56:16,465
[SPEAKER_25]: Where's the webcam for that?

1736
01:56:16,825 --> 01:56:17,865
[SPEAKER_04]: She was just here.

1737
01:56:17,885 --> 01:56:20,265
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know if I might have caught a screenshot.

1738
01:56:20,305 --> 01:56:22,226
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1739
01:56:23,766 --> 01:56:28,267
[SPEAKER_04]: We're getting really bad echo, so I've got to let you go, but thank you so much for your support.

1740
01:56:28,727 --> 01:56:29,247
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

1741
01:56:29,888 --> 01:56:30,348
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all right.

1742
01:56:30,368 --> 01:56:30,648
[SPEAKER_04]: Take care.

1743
01:56:30,668 --> 01:56:31,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep up the good work, all right?

1744
01:56:32,068 --> 01:56:32,488
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1745
01:56:32,548 --> 01:56:33,668
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a good one.

1746
01:56:33,849 --> 01:56:34,249
[SPEAKER_07]: You too.

1747
01:56:34,469 --> 01:56:34,729
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1748
01:56:34,749 --> 01:56:35,189
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye-bye.

1749
01:56:35,309 --> 01:56:35,869
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye-bye.

1750
01:56:36,049 --> 01:56:40,070
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm pulling this at the end of my drinking binge right here.

1751
01:56:40,310 --> 01:56:42,451
[SPEAKER_24]: This drink is the last one.

1752
01:56:42,611 --> 01:56:44,613
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm drinking water from here on out, man.

1753
01:57:02,263 --> 01:57:04,785
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm so dizzy right now.

1754
01:57:04,925 --> 01:57:08,508
[SPEAKER_24]: Everything's spinning around and around.

1755
01:57:08,709 --> 01:57:10,570
[SPEAKER_24]: It's just not even funny.

1756
01:57:10,630 --> 01:57:18,457
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm walking out there, my limbs are numb, my hands are numb, my feet are numb, my lips are numb.

1757
01:57:18,597 --> 01:57:22,600
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just walking out there, stumbling around like a complete idiot.

1758
01:57:23,321 --> 01:57:24,221
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not even funny.

1759
01:57:24,301 --> 01:57:28,525
[SPEAKER_04]: But honestly, folks, Destroy All Humans, awesome game.

1760
01:57:28,785 --> 01:57:29,586
[SPEAKER_04]: You can play that game.

1761
01:57:30,962 --> 01:57:33,503
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, we're going to go to a break, boys and girls.

1762
01:57:33,803 --> 01:57:35,244
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do the podcast!

1763
01:57:35,384 --> 01:57:37,205
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we can't do the podcast yet.

1764
01:57:37,245 --> 01:57:38,865
[SPEAKER_04]: The podcast is in another hour.

1765
01:57:38,885 --> 01:57:40,266
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, fine.

1766
01:57:41,286 --> 01:57:42,347
Whee!

1767
01:57:43,567 --> 01:57:50,790
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, we're going to go to a break, and in this break we're going to hear some guitar freaks, drum mania stuff, because I'm going to eat the microphone.

1768
01:57:51,314 --> 01:57:52,414
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to be fun.

1769
01:57:52,755 --> 01:57:54,555
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie looked good in her skirt, didn't she?

1770
01:57:54,575 --> 01:57:55,596
[SPEAKER_04]: Where did she go?

1771
01:57:55,816 --> 01:58:00,518
[SPEAKER_04]: She went to the bathroom because she doesn't think she looks good, but she does.

1772
01:58:00,758 --> 01:58:00,978
[SPEAKER_23]: Why?

1773
01:58:01,058 --> 01:58:02,239
[SPEAKER_23]: She looks incredible.

1774
01:58:02,259 --> 01:58:02,459
[SPEAKER_04]: She does.

1775
01:58:02,479 --> 01:58:03,039
[SPEAKER_04]: She looks fine.

1776
01:58:03,959 --> 01:58:04,660
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

1777
01:58:04,700 --> 01:58:07,261
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just like drunk, so I think everyone looks hot.

1778
01:58:10,022 --> 01:58:10,782
[SPEAKER_23]: Jamie!

1779
01:58:11,403 --> 01:58:12,243
[SPEAKER_23]: Jamie!

1780
01:58:12,583 --> 01:58:13,423
[SPEAKER_23]: Where did you go?

1781
01:58:13,544 --> 01:58:15,444
[SPEAKER_04]: I think she's yelling at us, so we better go to break.

1782
01:58:15,464 --> 01:58:16,165
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I need a drink.

1783
01:58:16,805 --> 01:58:18,125
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you better not have any more drinks.

1784
01:58:18,145 --> 01:58:18,426
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

1785
01:58:18,446 --> 01:58:18,926
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

1786
01:58:20,475 --> 01:58:21,975
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't hold me back.

1787
01:58:22,796 --> 01:58:23,436
[SPEAKER_04]: Break time.

1788
01:58:23,936 --> 01:58:24,656
[SPEAKER_04]: No!

1789
01:58:24,816 --> 01:58:26,517
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, we'll be back after this break.

1790
01:58:26,557 --> 01:58:27,737
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to tally up the cage match votes.

1791
01:58:27,957 --> 01:58:28,437
[SPEAKER_04]: So hurry up.

1792
01:58:28,497 --> 01:58:29,598
[SPEAKER_04]: Last call for cage match votes.

1793
01:58:29,618 --> 01:58:33,659
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank God there's no karaoke revolution now because I don't want to sing.

1794
01:58:33,779 --> 01:58:35,640
[SPEAKER_04]: Starting off with Stop Spinning Me in Circles.

1795
01:58:35,700 --> 01:58:36,140
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be back.

1796
01:58:36,360 --> 01:58:37,980
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm spinning myself.

1797
01:58:41,361 --> 01:58:43,282
[SPEAKER_16]: You've got to tell me what you want.

1798
01:59:07,905 --> 01:59:08,612
Thanks for watching!

1799
01:59:57,717 --> 01:59:58,772
Thanks for watching!

1800
02:00:27,353 --> 02:00:28,914
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for watching!

1801
02:01:03,617 --> 02:01:04,938
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1802
02:01:32,825 --> 02:01:33,867
Thank you for watching!

1803
02:03:11,888 --> 02:03:12,749
It's great, man!

1804
02:03:59,376 --> 02:04:17,986
Party after party, beauty and money, we were so desperate for perfection But you have made me feel so good, I've only been closer to you I close my eyes, and your love is simple again

1805
02:04:37,354 --> 02:04:39,535
Last week on Orange Lounge Radio.

1806
02:04:39,655 --> 02:04:45,037
Next week on the show we're going to have our very first special guest.

1807
02:05:05,199 --> 02:05:14,269
[SPEAKER_14]: We're actually having over Melody and Melby, and they're going to be our guests on the show, and I get to clean house all week to be ready for them.

1808
02:05:15,170 --> 02:05:15,551
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, God.

1809
02:05:16,071 --> 02:05:19,815
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to move everything out and deliver, because this room's cramped as it is when we do the show here.

1810
02:05:20,056 --> 02:05:22,719
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd have to say so, and quite dirty and moist.

1811
02:05:23,940 --> 02:05:25,542
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you feeling a little moist tonight, Jamie?

1812
02:05:26,351 --> 02:05:27,511
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, every night on the show.

1813
02:05:31,233 --> 02:05:32,693
[SPEAKER_13]: As Irene makes us say.

1814
02:05:33,173 --> 02:05:36,115
[SPEAKER_01]: Orange Lounge Radio makes you moist as a snack.

1815
02:05:36,175 --> 02:05:38,976
[SPEAKER_01]: Join us every Sunday night from 7 p.m.

1816
02:05:39,116 --> 02:05:40,096
[SPEAKER_01]: until 9 p.m.

1817
02:05:40,136 --> 02:05:49,919
[SPEAKER_01]: Pacific Standard Time for the Orange Lounge with your hosts, DarkSakura and Sky, where we'll talk about all things Bomani and then some.

1818
02:05:50,380 --> 02:05:53,841
[SPEAKER_01]: In the meantime, enjoy our Bomani Music and More program.

1819
02:05:54,798 --> 02:06:02,142
[SPEAKER_04]: Another flashback there, an old episode, I don't know, that's like episode 5 or something, I don't know, it's old, it's hecka old.

1820
02:06:03,022 --> 02:06:14,749
[SPEAKER_04]: We're back here on Orange Lounge Radio, and I've been doing a little bit of drinking, and I'm cut off now, and I think Loki is stuck with water now, and DarkSakura, how you doing?

1821
02:06:14,769 --> 02:06:18,311
[SPEAKER_14]: I would love the chat room forever if they tell me how to take those damn ink tags off my clothes.

1822
02:06:19,813 --> 02:06:20,874
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a bunch of crap.

1823
02:06:20,894 --> 02:06:22,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Fucking Hot Topic fucked up.

1824
02:06:22,675 --> 02:06:26,879
[SPEAKER_04]: I can never figure out how you were able to get out of Hot Topic with the tag on.

1825
02:06:26,899 --> 02:06:28,600
[SPEAKER_04]: Because wouldn't it have beeped?

1826
02:06:29,101 --> 02:06:29,521
[SPEAKER_04]: Should have.

1827
02:06:29,921 --> 02:06:30,602
[SPEAKER_04]: Logically.

1828
02:06:30,802 --> 02:06:32,323
[SPEAKER_04]: But now you know how to steal clothes.

1829
02:06:32,824 --> 02:06:33,564
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe you should.

1830
02:06:33,845 --> 02:06:35,066
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to teach them a lesson.

1831
02:06:35,266 --> 02:06:35,386
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1832
02:06:39,627 --> 02:06:45,090
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura is sounding a little angsty to me, so I think we need to get in the FUs of the week.

1833
02:06:45,150 --> 02:06:48,152
[SPEAKER_04]: However, I do want to announce tonight's cage match winner.

1834
02:06:48,492 --> 02:06:51,833
[SPEAKER_04]: But we didn't have a lot of votes in tonight's cage match, which makes me a sad panda.

1835
02:06:52,074 --> 02:06:53,594
[SPEAKER_04]: Doesn't that make you sad a little bit?

1836
02:06:54,115 --> 02:06:54,475
[SPEAKER_04]: A little.

1837
02:06:55,035 --> 02:06:59,517
[SPEAKER_04]: But we do have a winner nonetheless, because even if there's one vote, one vote is enough to declare the cage match.

1838
02:06:59,537 --> 02:07:02,439
[SPEAKER_04]: So here is tonight's cage match wiener.

1839
02:07:03,799 --> 02:07:04,800
[SPEAKER_04]: The wiener is...

1840
02:07:06,704 --> 02:07:10,166
[SPEAKER_04]: TheOzoic, let me tell you something.

1841
02:07:10,746 --> 02:07:15,229
[SPEAKER_04]: By one vote, one vote for TheOzoic wins tonight's cage match.

1842
02:07:15,269 --> 02:07:16,410
[SPEAKER_04]: Good job, boys and girls.

1843
02:07:17,510 --> 02:07:17,971
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1844
02:07:21,193 --> 02:07:25,255
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, I think you're wanting to get your angst on, aren't you?

1845
02:07:26,445 --> 02:07:27,006
[SPEAKER_04]: Hot Topic Sucks

1846
02:07:49,698 --> 02:07:53,940
[SPEAKER_14]: So I caught topic for leaving the ink tag on my damn skirt that I was going to wear tonight.

1847
02:07:54,300 --> 02:07:57,381
[SPEAKER_14]: So now I have to find something to wrap the ink tag in while I cut the wire.

1848
02:07:58,541 --> 02:07:58,881
[SPEAKER_14]: That's all.

1849
02:08:00,042 --> 02:08:00,502
[SPEAKER_14]: That's it?

1850
02:08:02,502 --> 02:08:02,923
[SPEAKER_14]: That's it.

1851
02:08:03,823 --> 02:08:04,183
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1852
02:08:06,504 --> 02:08:09,105
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on, I've got to find Loki's music here.

1853
02:08:09,145 --> 02:08:09,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Here it is.

1854
02:08:10,485 --> 02:08:11,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, your turn.

1855
02:08:13,026 --> 02:08:14,907
[SPEAKER_04]: Chat room, you can send in your FUs right now if you want.

1856
02:08:14,947 --> 02:08:15,827
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, here you go, your turn.

1857
02:08:17,608 --> 02:08:26,890
[SPEAKER_24]: The only thing I'm really mad about is how drunk I am, because I felt like I was going to throw up something in the bathroom, but I didn't.

1858
02:08:28,030 --> 02:08:30,651
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank God I'm not that drunk yet, so.

1859
02:08:33,391 --> 02:08:41,073
[SPEAKER_24]: Just F you to how drunk I am, and fuck you to Destroy All Humans, it's been such a short game.

1860
02:08:42,313 --> 02:08:45,194
[SPEAKER_24]: And, uh, that's it.

1861
02:08:47,293 --> 02:08:47,733
[SPEAKER_24]: Alright.

1862
02:08:48,754 --> 02:08:50,976
[SPEAKER_24]: Continue with whoever else is next.

1863
02:08:51,236 --> 02:08:53,577
[SPEAKER_04]: You can cut in the bathtub, just in case.

1864
02:08:54,598 --> 02:08:54,958
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

1865
02:08:55,799 --> 02:08:56,459
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm fine.

1866
02:08:56,499 --> 02:08:58,000
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm just very dizzy.

1867
02:08:59,381 --> 02:08:59,681
[SPEAKER_24]: Are you okay?

1868
02:08:59,701 --> 02:09:00,522
[SPEAKER_24]: Are you gonna pass out?

1869
02:09:01,323 --> 02:09:01,983
[SPEAKER_24]: No, I'm fine.

1870
02:09:03,184 --> 02:09:06,346
[SPEAKER_24]: I felt like I was gonna throw up earlier, but I didn't, so it's good.

1871
02:09:07,166 --> 02:09:08,027
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not angsty?

1872
02:09:09,148 --> 02:09:10,249
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm very drunk.

1873
02:09:10,389 --> 02:09:15,272
[SPEAKER_24]: Like, I don't have the energy to be angsty, so... It's good.

1874
02:09:17,606 --> 02:09:17,947
[SPEAKER_24]: Manama!

1875
02:09:17,967 --> 02:09:18,367
[SPEAKER_24]: Manama!

1876
02:09:19,870 --> 02:09:20,490
[SPEAKER_24]: Manama!

1877
02:09:32,685 --> 02:09:36,488
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't find my song, that's why I'm stalling.

1878
02:09:36,548 --> 02:09:37,949
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you sure you don't have anything else?

1879
02:09:38,470 --> 02:09:40,792
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

1880
02:09:40,812 --> 02:09:52,601
[SPEAKER_23]: The only thing I have is why the hell did my family decide to listen to this show now when I'm drunk instead of like normally when I'm doing a normal show.

1881
02:09:53,922 --> 02:10:08,867
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't understand that kind of stuff, but whatever, you know, they know I'm drunk and I know they know that I'm not normally drunk, so I am way wasted right now.

1882
02:10:10,447 --> 02:10:12,988
[SPEAKER_23]: I am so dizzy it's not even funny.

1883
02:10:15,789 --> 02:10:16,469
[SPEAKER_24]: Manamana.

1884
02:10:19,790 --> 02:10:20,911
[SPEAKER_24]: Manamana.

1885
02:10:21,571 --> 02:10:21,891
[SPEAKER_24]: Any luck?

1886
02:10:24,656 --> 02:10:27,678
[SPEAKER_24]: I can't even see you people because you're so damn drunk.

1887
02:10:32,099 --> 02:10:35,040
[SPEAKER_04]: The chat room is noticing how slow your speech got all of a sudden.

1888
02:10:35,300 --> 02:10:36,341
[SPEAKER_04]: How many drinks did you have again?

1889
02:10:38,682 --> 02:10:41,002
[SPEAKER_04]: Four double shots.

1890
02:10:41,022 --> 02:10:46,404
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's empty.

1891
02:10:47,565 --> 02:10:48,285
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god.

1892
02:10:48,405 --> 02:10:48,925
[SPEAKER_04]: My turn.

1893
02:10:49,205 --> 02:10:49,605
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut up, Loki.

1894
02:10:49,665 --> 02:10:50,066
[SPEAKER_04]: It's my turn.

1895
02:10:50,406 --> 02:10:50,606
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

1896
02:10:57,826 --> 02:11:04,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I'm giving you an F you to the motherfucker who broke into my car for the second time nonetheless.

1897
02:11:05,350 --> 02:11:06,771
[SPEAKER_04]: Fool me once, shame on you.

1898
02:11:06,831 --> 02:11:08,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Fool me twice, shame on me.

1899
02:11:08,132 --> 02:11:08,812
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate you.

1900
02:11:09,313 --> 02:11:10,693
[SPEAKER_04]: Why did you have to do that to me?

1901
02:11:10,894 --> 02:11:12,014
[SPEAKER_04]: I am a nice guy.

1902
02:11:12,054 --> 02:11:14,135
[SPEAKER_04]: A nice guy should not have the car broken into.

1903
02:11:14,215 --> 02:11:14,936
[SPEAKER_04]: And just...

1904
02:11:15,775 --> 02:11:22,617
[SPEAKER_04]: F you to the fact that I didn't have a car alarm, but I shouldn't have to get an alarm, because people should have the common fucking decency not to break into your shit.

1905
02:11:23,217 --> 02:11:32,859
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope you enjoy the stereo, I hope it blows up on you, and I hope you get gonorrhea and die of SARS, because you're just an asshole who steals things from people, who steals things that aren't yours.

1906
02:11:33,600 --> 02:11:39,741
[SPEAKER_04]: And now I'm gonna have to rent a garage because of you, and that's $70 a month, I'm out the money, because you can't keep your hands off my shit.

1907
02:11:40,021 --> 02:11:42,362
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep your hands off my shit, you shit-eater!

1908
02:11:44,699 --> 02:11:47,361
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, an FU to that.

1909
02:11:48,722 --> 02:11:51,104
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's go to the chatroom FUs.

1910
02:11:55,847 --> 02:12:01,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Dark Knight says, my FU is going to be for my job to have me work on the 4th, bitches.

1911
02:12:06,274 --> 02:12:11,197
[SPEAKER_04]: Dark Knight says, if it's a certain tag, all you need to do is pinch one of the tags.

1912
02:12:11,678 --> 02:12:13,059
[SPEAKER_04]: So get like a pair of pliers.

1913
02:12:15,430 --> 02:12:22,578
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, the way that this one is, it's got the clear tag with the blue ink and the yellow ink.

1914
02:12:22,738 --> 02:12:24,059
[SPEAKER_14]: You can see through the tag.

1915
02:12:24,440 --> 02:12:29,585
[SPEAKER_14]: The other side has a long part that's attached to a more cylindrical looking part with a domed end.

1916
02:12:30,185 --> 02:12:33,008
[SPEAKER_14]: You can see a thin wire connecting the two.

1917
02:12:33,769 --> 02:12:43,995
[SPEAKER_14]: What I am concerned about is that without having anything to wrap it in, if I cut the wire because it is magnetically charged, at the point it senses the magnetic disruption, it will explode the ink.

1918
02:12:44,676 --> 02:12:45,756
[SPEAKER_14]: I have nothing to wrap it in.

1919
02:12:47,537 --> 02:12:48,818
[SPEAKER_14]: So yeah, find me a way around that.

1920
02:12:53,921 --> 02:12:56,503
[SPEAKER_04]: Illusion says F you to Loki and his slurred speech.

1921
02:13:03,756 --> 02:13:04,576
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, where else are we?

1922
02:13:05,357 --> 02:13:10,681
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, Chimera says, F you to swimming at... Chimera says, F you to... I'm drunk.

1923
02:13:11,062 --> 02:13:13,183
[SPEAKER_04]: F you to swimming at 6 in the goddamn morning.

1924
02:13:15,025 --> 02:13:15,385
[SPEAKER_04]: You okay?

1925
02:13:15,445 --> 02:13:15,886
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki!

1926
02:13:16,726 --> 02:13:17,207
[SPEAKER_04]: You okay?

1927
02:13:17,627 --> 02:13:19,168
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki just fell on the floor.

1928
02:13:19,709 --> 02:13:20,129
[SPEAKER_04]: Is he okay?

1929
02:13:20,149 --> 02:13:20,790
[SPEAKER_04]: Should I just leave him?

1930
02:13:22,891 --> 02:13:23,212
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1931
02:13:26,167 --> 02:13:52,937
[SPEAKER_04]: Aguanagirl says, my F you is too emotion, and I don't think this is the song either I've had a horribly emotional week, finally got my cry on this afternoon, so I'm feeling better, but yeah Fuck you to everything hitting you all at once to where you feel piled on top of with drama Ranchan says, F you to New York State, you fucker owe me an unemployment check

1932
02:13:55,202 --> 02:13:59,285
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkTetsuya says, seconded on the F you to the bastards who broke into your car.

1933
02:13:59,686 --> 02:14:01,547
[SPEAKER_04]: Same thing happened to my mom some years ago.

1934
02:14:04,370 --> 02:14:11,095
[SPEAKER_04]: Illusion says, F you to my Target interview sucking and me being pretty sure I didn't get the job.

1935
02:14:13,417 --> 02:14:20,183
[SPEAKER_04]: VidPalace says, F you to homework over holiday weekends and F you to my DVD case being cracked in the mail.

1936
02:14:21,775 --> 02:14:28,777
[SPEAKER_04]: and DeepThought42 says, F you to the Hillary Clinton for saying that video games are to blame for your kids' sociopathic behavior.

1937
02:14:28,837 --> 02:14:30,657
[SPEAKER_08]: It's your fucking parents' fault!

1938
02:14:31,458 --> 02:14:32,298
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn straight.

1939
02:14:37,059 --> 02:14:37,579
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's it.

1940
02:14:38,600 --> 02:14:40,360
[SPEAKER_04]: That's our chatter's F yous.

1941
02:14:40,420 --> 02:14:41,500
[SPEAKER_04]: They're kind of anxious.

1942
02:14:41,640 --> 02:14:42,321
[SPEAKER_04]: Is he okay?

1943
02:14:42,341 --> 02:14:44,601
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1944
02:14:44,841 --> 02:14:48,142
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the first time, this is probably the only time he's going to bow down to your feet, though.

1945
02:14:48,782 --> 02:14:49,182
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey!

1946
02:14:50,983 --> 02:14:51,123
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm

1947
02:14:51,798 --> 02:14:53,939
[SPEAKER_24]: Perfectly fine.

1948
02:14:59,702 --> 02:15:02,543
[SPEAKER_04]: I really don't know what to do with the rest of the show, boys and girls.

1949
02:15:02,903 --> 02:15:04,304
[SPEAKER_09]: I can entertain people, I'm sober.

1950
02:15:04,564 --> 02:15:06,665
[SPEAKER_04]: Nellie, what do you want to do to entertain our listeners?

1951
02:15:07,486 --> 02:15:09,046
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I don't know.

1952
02:15:09,627 --> 02:15:11,468
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's hear some Matt's wisdom.

1953
02:15:11,948 --> 02:15:13,028
[SPEAKER_09]: Matt's drunken wisdom.

1954
02:15:13,809 --> 02:15:14,069
[SPEAKER_09]: Burp.

1955
02:15:14,689 --> 02:15:17,751
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm so tired.

1956
02:15:19,531 --> 02:15:19,952
[SPEAKER_04]: Whew.

1957
02:15:22,285 --> 02:15:23,966
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, DeepThought42 had another one.

1958
02:15:24,146 --> 02:15:27,288
[SPEAKER_04]: F you to my fucking computer for causing that fucking echo on the air.

1959
02:15:28,689 --> 02:15:29,049
[SPEAKER_04]: Amen.

1960
02:15:31,171 --> 02:15:32,091
[SPEAKER_04]: Where did Extifer go?

1961
02:15:32,131 --> 02:15:33,953
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't kick him in the butt when he's passed out.

1962
02:15:33,973 --> 02:15:34,653
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not nice.

1963
02:15:34,673 --> 02:15:35,253
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't fall asleep.

1964
02:15:35,394 --> 02:15:38,115
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not falling asleep.

1965
02:15:38,255 --> 02:15:41,878
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just tired.

1966
02:15:48,115 --> 02:15:50,036
[SPEAKER_04]: I really don't know what to do with the show at this point.

1967
02:15:50,837 --> 02:15:52,858
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to a break.

1968
02:15:53,078 --> 02:15:55,860
[SPEAKER_04]: That's always a good thing to do when the show is going crazy.

1969
02:15:56,660 --> 02:15:59,482
[SPEAKER_04]: My stomach is full of... Almohal.

1970
02:16:00,662 --> 02:16:01,183
[SPEAKER_04]: Almohal?

1971
02:16:02,303 --> 02:16:03,184
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki is rambling.

1972
02:16:03,704 --> 02:16:06,266
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to give Loki some time to cheer up.

1973
02:16:06,646 --> 02:16:08,427
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, you said you wanted to hear something earlier.

1974
02:16:08,447 --> 02:16:08,927
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you want to hear?

1975
02:16:09,147 --> 02:16:09,527
[SPEAKER_11]: I forgot.

1976
02:16:10,628 --> 02:16:12,409
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, anything off the top of your head?

1977
02:16:13,513 --> 02:16:13,853
[SPEAKER_04]: Taku.

1978
02:16:14,393 --> 02:16:14,854
[SPEAKER_04]: Taku.

1979
02:16:16,314 --> 02:16:18,055
[SPEAKER_04]: Voltage by the one and only Taku.

1980
02:16:18,095 --> 02:16:18,415
[SPEAKER_04]: How's that?

1981
02:16:19,495 --> 02:16:19,855
[SPEAKER_04]: It works.

1982
02:16:20,175 --> 02:16:20,476
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1983
02:16:20,916 --> 02:16:21,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Some 2DX then.

1984
02:16:21,756 --> 02:16:23,537
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll do a 2DX break.

1985
02:16:23,797 --> 02:16:26,258
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.

1986
02:16:26,298 --> 02:16:27,358
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe some Ask Orange Lounge.

1987
02:16:27,658 --> 02:16:28,699
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever we can come up with.

1988
02:16:28,799 --> 02:16:29,259
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be back.

1989
02:18:09,560 --> 02:18:10,401
Thanks for watching!

1990
02:18:34,351 --> 02:18:34,972
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks for watching!

1991
02:19:58,021 --> 02:19:59,802
[SPEAKER_16]: Stand by your friends who's wild

1992
02:20:31,998 --> 02:20:33,279
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1993
02:21:10,206 --> 02:21:14,868
Thanks for watching!

1994
02:22:14,936 --> 02:22:16,101
Thank you for watching!

1995
02:23:11,875 --> 02:23:14,656
[SPEAKER_01]: Last week on Orange Lounge Radio.

1996
02:23:36,247 --> 02:23:40,368
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, is that trying to spin off on Iron Chef, like Iron 2DX?

1997
02:23:41,148 --> 02:23:44,109
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know, it's like Tekken for 2DX.

1998
02:23:44,929 --> 02:23:46,429
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, the king of iron fingering.

1999
02:23:47,589 --> 02:23:48,290
[SPEAKER_14]: Whoa!

2000
02:23:49,190 --> 02:23:52,210
[SPEAKER_14]: Never mind, I said another... Remember that part about adult content?

2001
02:23:54,571 --> 02:23:58,792
[SPEAKER_14]: I was referring to this in a completely innocent manner, you pervert.

2002
02:24:00,447 --> 02:24:01,548
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2003
02:24:27,426 --> 02:24:29,087
[SPEAKER_22]: Another classic bite there.

2004
02:24:30,368 --> 02:24:30,768
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes?

2005
02:24:33,009 --> 02:24:33,389
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

2006
02:24:34,270 --> 02:24:41,213
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, we just had an incident in the studio, so we needed to do one more song, guys, and we'll explain what's going on when we come back.

2007
02:24:41,433 --> 02:24:43,955
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I've got to run and get something real quick.

2008
02:24:44,755 --> 02:24:46,336
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll explain what's going on when we come back.

2009
02:24:48,877 --> 02:24:50,438
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you doing over there, DarkSakura?

2010
02:24:51,538 --> 02:24:52,459
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm almost sober again.

2011
02:24:54,352 --> 02:24:57,415
[SPEAKER_14]: You know my tolerance, and you know how fucking much it takes me.

2012
02:24:57,435 --> 02:25:00,498
[SPEAKER_04]: What just happened surprisingly sobered me up, especially.

2013
02:25:00,598 --> 02:25:01,639
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll be back right after this.

2014
02:25:01,699 --> 02:25:02,700
[SPEAKER_14]: I just sat here going, wow.

2015
02:25:04,462 --> 02:25:07,485
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be back right after this song from Extreme USA with more Orange Lounge.

2016
02:25:24,347 --> 02:25:25,829
Thank you for watching!

2017
02:25:46,869 --> 02:25:47,690
Love, love, love

2018
02:26:11,680 --> 02:26:23,466
Simply Be In Love Simply Be In Love Simply Be In Love Simply Be In Love Simply Be In Love Simply Be In Love Simply Be In Love

2019
02:26:40,117 --> 02:26:51,561
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, we're back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

2020
02:26:51,601 --> 02:26:54,422
[SPEAKER_04]: That was BT, Simply Being Loved.

2021
02:26:56,143 --> 02:26:59,865
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so, gosh, how do we explain this?

2022
02:27:01,245 --> 02:27:03,706
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically what happened during the last break there... Loki puked!

2023
02:27:03,846 --> 02:27:05,527
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, basically Loki farted.

2024
02:27:07,087 --> 02:27:07,628
[SPEAKER_06]: On his pants.

2025
02:27:07,648 --> 02:27:09,068
[SPEAKER_06]: He didn't quite make it to the toilet.

2026
02:27:09,088 --> 02:27:10,029
[SPEAKER_06]: He just kind of sat there.

2027
02:27:10,049 --> 02:27:11,970
[SPEAKER_04]: He just sat there and said, oh, bleh.

2028
02:27:12,110 --> 02:27:14,251
[SPEAKER_04]: And then suddenly he was like, I have an announcement.

2029
02:27:14,451 --> 02:27:14,872
[SPEAKER_04]: Bleh.

2030
02:27:16,593 --> 02:27:17,533
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're not sure.

2031
02:27:17,593 --> 02:27:19,314
[SPEAKER_04]: There's one more spot that needs to be wiped up, too.

2032
02:27:19,974 --> 02:27:22,216
[SPEAKER_04]: So... I hope not.

2033
02:27:22,596 --> 02:27:25,217
[SPEAKER_04]: So he's being addressed by Nellie right now.

2034
02:27:25,518 --> 02:27:28,019
[SPEAKER_04]: Surprisingly, that sobered me up to have that happen.

2035
02:27:28,159 --> 02:27:30,781
[SPEAKER_14]: I've been sitting here sober for the past 10, 15 minutes.

2036
02:27:30,801 --> 02:27:30,841
[SPEAKER_14]: So...

2037
02:27:35,136 --> 02:27:37,078
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm wearing my skirt with the tag tonight.

2038
02:27:38,920 --> 02:27:40,222
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to fucking be hot if it kills me.

2039
02:27:40,242 --> 02:27:41,223
[SPEAKER_14]: Girl, you are already hot.

2040
02:27:54,577 --> 02:27:56,698
[SPEAKER_04]: We still have a podcast we got to do after this.

2041
02:27:56,878 --> 02:27:57,998
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what we're going to do.

2042
02:27:59,739 --> 02:28:01,399
[SPEAKER_04]: The final drink count.

2043
02:28:01,499 --> 02:28:03,160
[SPEAKER_04]: What is tonight's final drink count?

2044
02:28:03,560 --> 02:28:05,201
[SPEAKER_04]: How much did you have to drink, DarkSakura?

2045
02:28:07,081 --> 02:28:07,521
[SPEAKER_14]: Ten shots.

2046
02:28:08,122 --> 02:28:13,003
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I finished off with a nine because I had eight shots of Malibu and then a Guinness, which counts as one shot.

2047
02:28:13,023 --> 02:28:14,504
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki had ten shots, but he puked.

2048
02:28:15,124 --> 02:28:15,704
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki had how much?

2049
02:28:16,104 --> 02:28:16,324
[SPEAKER_14]: Ten.

2050
02:28:16,504 --> 02:28:17,085
[SPEAKER_04]: Ten, but he puked.

2051
02:28:17,105 --> 02:28:17,825
[SPEAKER_14]: But I'm sober.

2052
02:28:19,105 --> 02:28:23,967
[SPEAKER_04]: If I had had one more shot, I probably would have puked because I was at that point where I was like, I'm going to barf, but I didn't.

2053
02:28:24,528 --> 02:28:33,093
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2054
02:28:49,771 --> 02:28:51,492
[SPEAKER_04]: One of them you passed out in my bed.

2055
02:28:51,592 --> 02:28:52,432
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't pass out.

2056
02:28:52,712 --> 02:28:54,812
[SPEAKER_14]: Remember, I was making commentary from your bedroom.

2057
02:28:55,313 --> 02:28:58,973
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the closest that we've had to a barfing experience.

2058
02:28:59,174 --> 02:29:00,454
[SPEAKER_14]: I did not pass out, however.

2059
02:29:01,834 --> 02:29:04,075
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you remember I was screaming at you from your bedroom?

2060
02:29:04,355 --> 02:29:05,035
[SPEAKER_04]: I vaguely remember.

2061
02:29:05,055 --> 02:29:05,715
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the same episode.

2062
02:29:05,735 --> 02:29:08,456
[SPEAKER_13]: And then I went, Waffle!

2063
02:29:08,876 --> 02:29:14,537
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the same episode where I was kicking the wall, running up and down, yelling, I'm in the Matrix, I'm in the Matrix.

2064
02:29:15,598 --> 02:29:16,358
[SPEAKER_14]: That was great.

2065
02:29:17,179 --> 02:29:17,739
[SPEAKER_04]: Did it happen again?

2066
02:29:17,759 --> 02:29:18,420
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you okay?

2067
02:29:18,700 --> 02:29:19,640
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought you were sober.

2068
02:29:19,700 --> 02:29:20,520
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't look sober.

2069
02:29:21,301 --> 02:29:24,222
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki, keep... Okay, I'm going to get Loki some cookies.

2070
02:29:24,302 --> 02:29:25,282
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, pick up the microphone.

2071
02:29:25,623 --> 02:29:26,563
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you pick up the microphone down there?

2072
02:29:28,284 --> 02:29:29,304
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought he was sobering up.

2073
02:29:29,344 --> 02:29:30,084
[SPEAKER_04]: He looks drunker.

2074
02:29:30,445 --> 02:29:30,765
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello?

2075
02:29:31,885 --> 02:29:33,046
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell the charm how you're feeling.

2076
02:29:33,966 --> 02:29:36,347
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm feeling incredibly dizzy.

2077
02:29:37,187 --> 02:29:39,548
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think I just threw up earlier.

2078
02:29:40,069 --> 02:29:40,569
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you did.

2079
02:29:41,129 --> 02:29:43,150
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you're wearing my clothes now, might I point out.

2080
02:29:43,350 --> 02:29:44,270
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, I am.

2081
02:29:44,971 --> 02:29:44,991
[SPEAKER_24]: I...

2082
02:29:46,343 --> 02:29:56,806
[SPEAKER_24]: I've drank too much, honestly, normally I drink a lot more water to coincide with my, you know, drinking alcohol, so I don't feel like, you know, I have to eat a cookie.

2083
02:29:56,826 --> 02:29:58,266
[SPEAKER_24]: No, I don't, I'm not hungry.

2084
02:30:00,927 --> 02:30:02,908
[SPEAKER_24]: I can't eat the cookie right now, honestly.

2085
02:30:03,388 --> 02:30:08,049
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't care if you can eat it or not, fucking eat the cookie to neutralize the alcohol in your stomach.

2086
02:30:08,789 --> 02:30:10,290
[SPEAKER_23]: I will be sick, honestly.

2087
02:30:13,011 --> 02:30:14,311
[SPEAKER_23]: Just give me a second to

2088
02:30:14,824 --> 02:30:21,566
[SPEAKER_23]: Freaking, you know, honestly, I just, just give me some water and I'll be fine, okay?

2089
02:30:23,047 --> 02:30:32,350
[SPEAKER_23]: Because if I drink anymore, I'm honestly very full right now, and I can't drink anymore, you know, alcohol or anything, to be, you know, honest.

2090
02:30:33,430 --> 02:30:36,791
[SPEAKER_23]: I just, I feel honestly tired as hell.

2091
02:30:38,232 --> 02:30:41,453
[SPEAKER_23]: This is why you shouldn't drink, folks, I mean, honestly.

2092
02:30:42,133 --> 02:31:09,737
[SPEAKER_24]: because you'll end up like me, and that's not good, but, um, just, just whatever, I mean, honestly, thank God my family stopped listening to this show, like, long ago, so, it's not good, just don't go crazy with the alcohol, and just take it easy, you know, have some fun at the fireworks, and whatnot, and whatever.

2093
02:31:11,283 --> 02:31:12,604
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm tired, I need a nap.

2094
02:31:13,945 --> 02:31:16,507
[SPEAKER_00]: Just don't fall asleep and get my computer wet with that water.

2095
02:31:17,148 --> 02:31:27,396
[SPEAKER_23]: No, I'm not, I'm taking care of the computer, because I built this computer, so I know what it needs, you know, it does not need the excess alcohol dripped all over it.

2096
02:31:28,096 --> 02:31:31,339
[SPEAKER_23]: So, you know.

2097
02:31:31,839 --> 02:31:33,040
[SPEAKER_23]: What the hell are you playing?

2098
02:31:35,802 --> 02:31:46,946
[SPEAKER_23]: I mean, it's bad enough that my stomach hurts, I mean, so, folks, people, take it easy on the alcohol, don't go crazy with the fire, you're good, okay.

2099
02:31:50,327 --> 02:31:52,188
[SPEAKER_04]: What does the 4th of July mean to you, Loki?

2100
02:31:56,489 --> 02:31:58,870
[SPEAKER_04]: Turn on your mic, turn on your mic, your mic's off.

2101
02:32:01,380 --> 02:32:02,520
[SPEAKER_04]: What is the 4th of July Meteor?

2102
02:32:02,781 --> 02:32:13,725
[SPEAKER_23]: It means crappy fireworks that they've, like, totally toned down because people like me that get drunk and decide to light fireworks, so... You know what?

2103
02:32:14,125 --> 02:32:29,611
[SPEAKER_24]: Honestly, people, if I'm spending money on fireworks, I want them to be, you know, extremely explosive, so... I am so tired right now, it's not even funny, it's like... I feel like I'm asleep, so...

2104
02:32:31,559 --> 02:32:32,620
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't care, whatever.

2105
02:32:32,680 --> 02:32:34,641
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you learned a lesson from today's episode?

2106
02:32:36,102 --> 02:32:40,064
[SPEAKER_24]: My lesson from today's episode is drink more water before I start drinking.

2107
02:32:41,325 --> 02:32:42,706
[SPEAKER_14]: Other than that, I have learned a thing.

2108
02:32:42,726 --> 02:32:45,108
[SPEAKER_14]: The lesson of the evening is no one can fucking out drink me.

2109
02:32:45,328 --> 02:32:46,168
[SPEAKER_14]: Ha ha ha.

2110
02:32:48,570 --> 02:32:49,070
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.

2111
02:32:49,090 --> 02:32:50,531
[SPEAKER_04]: I will go back to the liquor bottle.

2112
02:32:52,973 --> 02:32:53,973
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever, Jamie.

2113
02:32:54,333 --> 02:32:55,574
[SPEAKER_14]: We do shots at the club tonight.

2114
02:32:55,814 --> 02:32:56,075
[SPEAKER_04]: Fine.

2115
02:32:57,756 --> 02:32:59,777
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm becoming more coherent.

2116
02:33:08,649 --> 02:33:10,770
[SPEAKER_04]: Suddenly Loki went into velociraptor mode.

2117
02:33:13,792 --> 02:33:14,992
[SPEAKER_23]: Listen, folks, okay?

2118
02:33:15,372 --> 02:33:18,554
[SPEAKER_23]: The room is spinning a lot less than it was before, okay?

2119
02:33:19,795 --> 02:33:20,135
[SPEAKER_23]: Water?

2120
02:33:20,275 --> 02:33:20,975
[SPEAKER_23]: I have water?

2121
02:33:21,876 --> 02:33:22,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, yay.

2122
02:33:24,737 --> 02:33:26,538
[SPEAKER_04]: Just think, Nellie, you get to go home with that.

2123
02:33:28,879 --> 02:33:29,780
[SPEAKER_23]: Listen, okay?

2124
02:33:31,280 --> 02:33:33,722
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, I'll sleep on the edge of the bed, I'm fine.

2125
02:33:34,342 --> 02:33:35,222
[SPEAKER_23]: But you know what?

2126
02:33:35,623 --> 02:33:38,204
[SPEAKER_23]: When I become sober, ooh yeah.

2127
02:33:39,011 --> 02:33:40,852
[SPEAKER_09]: Then what's gonna happen?

2128
02:33:40,872 --> 02:33:41,392
Oh yeah.

2129
02:33:43,913 --> 02:33:45,754
[SPEAKER_23]: Don't you be making fun of me now, okay?

2130
02:33:45,774 --> 02:33:49,575
[SPEAKER_23]: Cause when I'm sober, you aren't complaining, okay?

2131
02:33:50,976 --> 02:33:52,376
[SPEAKER_13]: He thinks he's gonna get some.

2132
02:33:52,396 --> 02:33:53,017
[SPEAKER_13]: Is he?

2133
02:33:53,717 --> 02:33:55,658
[SPEAKER_13]: Once he's sober, yes.

2134
02:33:56,758 --> 02:33:58,779
[SPEAKER_23]: Damn straight I'm gonna get some.

2135
02:33:59,959 --> 02:34:02,380
[SPEAKER_23]: When I'm sober, it's not complaining.

2136
02:34:02,600 --> 02:34:04,021
[SPEAKER_09]: When there's no puke on his breath.

2137
02:34:04,908 --> 02:34:06,009
[SPEAKER_09]: and when he can get it up.

2138
02:34:06,129 --> 02:34:07,289
[SPEAKER_04]: You need a breath mint?

2139
02:34:07,549 --> 02:34:09,030
[SPEAKER_04]: Extover, don't you have some breath mints somewhere?

2140
02:34:09,050 --> 02:34:10,071
[SPEAKER_04]: I have penguin mints.

2141
02:34:11,091 --> 02:34:15,674
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, folks, okay, Rob is like, he's all over the place.

2142
02:34:15,694 --> 02:34:16,614
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, I'm sober now.

2143
02:34:17,054 --> 02:34:17,815
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go driving.

2144
02:34:17,955 --> 02:34:18,395
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just kidding.

2145
02:34:18,455 --> 02:34:19,595
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm totally kidding.

2146
02:34:19,896 --> 02:34:23,337
[SPEAKER_23]: If I were to run towards Rob, I would probably hit the wall.

2147
02:34:25,438 --> 02:34:26,739
[SPEAKER_14]: So what type of drunk am I?

2148
02:34:26,819 --> 02:34:29,260
[SPEAKER_23]: My nose is numb, okay?

2149
02:34:29,360 --> 02:34:30,161
[SPEAKER_23]: My hand is numb.

2150
02:34:30,181 --> 02:34:31,081
[SPEAKER_14]: So what about my drinking?

2151
02:34:31,141 --> 02:34:32,562
[SPEAKER_14]: If Rob gets stupid, what about me?

2152
02:34:36,991 --> 02:34:38,553
[SPEAKER_14]: Rob, I am gonna be at that... Microphone towards mouth.

2153
02:34:38,573 --> 02:34:39,494
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

2154
02:34:39,514 --> 02:34:42,197
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob, I am gonna be totally at that stupid convention thing.

2155
02:34:42,237 --> 02:34:43,218
[SPEAKER_14]: When they have the people...

2156
02:34:59,156 --> 02:35:04,340
[SPEAKER_04]: That shit already happened last Sunday.

2157
02:35:04,500 --> 02:35:05,101
[SPEAKER_04]: You weren't there.

2158
02:35:05,201 --> 02:35:06,222
[SPEAKER_04]: It happened last Sunday.

2159
02:35:06,302 --> 02:35:06,822
[SPEAKER_04]: Where were you?

2160
02:35:06,862 --> 02:35:07,463
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn it.

2161
02:35:08,664 --> 02:35:12,367
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, fucking A. I'm going to be at the other thing.

2162
02:35:12,427 --> 02:35:13,628
[SPEAKER_04]: It's at Paradise Island.

2163
02:35:16,230 --> 02:35:17,531
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm so sick.

2164
02:35:17,551 --> 02:35:23,656
[SPEAKER_14]: Sigh.

2165
02:35:28,271 --> 02:35:29,992
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, have you learned any lessons tonight?

2166
02:35:30,732 --> 02:35:31,072
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

2167
02:35:32,873 --> 02:35:33,813
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you going to drink again?

2168
02:35:34,333 --> 02:35:34,693
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

2169
02:35:37,194 --> 02:35:39,755
[SPEAKER_04]: What will you do differently when you drink next time?

2170
02:35:40,155 --> 02:35:41,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Have more food beforehand.

2171
02:35:51,398 --> 02:35:56,100
[SPEAKER_14]: I have officially out-drinked everybody because I finished my beer within two minutes of opening it.

2172
02:36:07,474 --> 02:36:08,215
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you okay, Loki?

2173
02:36:09,295 --> 02:36:11,958
[SPEAKER_24]: I am perfectly fine.

2174
02:36:14,060 --> 02:36:17,743
[SPEAKER_24]: No, honestly, my stomach feels a little upset, but other than that, I'm fine.

2175
02:36:19,765 --> 02:36:20,385
[SPEAKER_24]: No, you're fine.

2176
02:36:22,648 --> 02:36:23,869
[SPEAKER_24]: I'M FINE!

2177
02:36:24,892 --> 02:36:33,135
[SPEAKER_24]: Don't be, don't be judging me just because I had a lot of like acid in my stomach from the stupid minestrone.

2178
02:36:36,076 --> 02:36:38,017
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm fine right now, okay?

2179
02:36:38,097 --> 02:36:40,398
[SPEAKER_24]: If I drink some more water, I'll be fine.

2180
02:36:44,299 --> 02:36:46,440
[SPEAKER_24]: Just, I'm drinking water, okay?

2181
02:36:53,959 --> 02:36:56,401
[SPEAKER_14]: What the fuck is with this music, okay?

2182
02:36:57,081 --> 02:36:59,243
[SPEAKER_14]: You need to fucking turn this shit off.

2183
02:36:59,583 --> 02:37:01,625
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm playing something that doesn't lick my ass.

2184
02:37:02,546 --> 02:37:04,847
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm fine, I just feel ill.

2185
02:37:09,211 --> 02:37:13,394
[SPEAKER_14]: I need to put my thumb on the webcam because my thumb is mutilated now thanks to Guinness.

2186
02:37:17,555 --> 02:37:23,219
[SPEAKER_04]: I really don't know what to say to our listeners who have stuck with us through such crap radio tonight.

2187
02:37:23,919 --> 02:37:28,662
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh oh, uh oh, oh god, Loki's going to barf again.

2188
02:37:28,702 --> 02:37:29,383
[SPEAKER_04]: Is he going to barf again?

2189
02:37:29,723 --> 02:37:31,364
[SPEAKER_04]: Nelly, please make sure his head lands in my toilet.

2190
02:37:38,389 --> 02:37:39,950
[SPEAKER_06]: Ew, I just heard that.

2191
02:37:41,718 --> 02:37:43,159
[SPEAKER_14]: I hope you boys and girls learned something from this.

2192
02:37:43,179 --> 02:37:45,522
[SPEAKER_14]: Drinking so much turns you into an ass.

2193
02:37:45,542 --> 02:37:46,142
[SPEAKER_14]: A complete and utter ass.

2194
02:38:02,455 --> 02:38:11,157
[SPEAKER_13]: Drinking makes me horny.

2195
02:38:11,197 --> 02:38:13,478
[SPEAKER_14]: Drinking makes me a cuddle whore.

2196
02:38:15,338 --> 02:38:18,919
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to hug everybody.

2197
02:38:22,240 --> 02:38:25,220
[SPEAKER_14]: I need waffles and spinach with no water.

2198
02:38:25,740 --> 02:38:26,100
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

2199
02:38:26,140 --> 02:38:27,701
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm almost thinking we ought to end the show.

2200
02:38:27,781 --> 02:38:28,401
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we're just...

2201
02:38:28,846 --> 02:38:31,889
[SPEAKER_14]: We've got 15 minutes to go.

2202
02:38:31,909 --> 02:38:32,410
[SPEAKER_14]: Go to a break.

2203
02:38:32,430 --> 02:38:33,151
[SPEAKER_04]: You want a little break?

2204
02:38:33,511 --> 02:38:34,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, we'll think of something to fill up.

2205
02:38:34,973 --> 02:38:36,794
[SPEAKER_14]: When we come back, it's Ask Orange Lounge.

2206
02:38:36,935 --> 02:38:38,076
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, Ask Orange Lounge.

2207
02:38:38,436 --> 02:38:42,020
[SPEAKER_04]: Send us questions and we'll get them in this next segment.

2208
02:38:42,080 --> 02:38:43,101
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Ask Orange Lounge.

2209
02:38:44,803 --> 02:38:46,745
[SPEAKER_14]: In the meantime... Oh, that burp tastes like Guinness.

2210
02:38:47,185 --> 02:38:48,487
[SPEAKER_14]: I have had 11 drinks tonight.

2211
02:38:49,708 --> 02:38:50,369
[SPEAKER_04]: Good job.

2212
02:38:51,417 --> 02:38:52,899
[SPEAKER_14]: Will you just barf again?

2213
02:38:53,179 --> 02:38:54,681
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I'm going to go take care of it.

2214
02:38:54,821 --> 02:38:57,244
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, we're going to go look and admire it.

2215
02:38:57,905 --> 02:38:58,405
[SPEAKER_04]: Cheek break!

2216
02:38:58,806 --> 02:39:03,952
[SPEAKER_04]: Send a message to Skye if you have a question for Ask Orange Lounge.

2217
02:39:03,972 --> 02:39:06,955
[SPEAKER_04]: In the meantime, we're going to get to... Bomani Potpourri, boys and girls.

2218
02:39:07,937 --> 02:39:08,758
[SPEAKER_04]: Started off with...

2219
02:39:10,350 --> 02:39:10,750
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

2220
02:39:11,270 --> 02:39:14,871
[SPEAKER_04]: How about something from 2DX10th style?

2221
02:39:16,092 --> 02:39:17,292
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm by myself right now.

2222
02:39:17,312 --> 02:39:18,192
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of scary.

2223
02:39:18,332 --> 02:39:21,493
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm starting to sober up, but I'm still... I'm like in that buzzed phase.

2224
02:39:24,414 --> 02:39:28,335
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be back with more of this fun stuff.

2225
02:39:28,815 --> 02:39:30,615
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll talk about video games at some point, too.

2226
02:39:30,835 --> 02:39:31,236
[SPEAKER_04]: Meteos.

2227
02:39:31,496 --> 02:39:31,916
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool game.

2228
02:39:32,136 --> 02:39:32,416
[SPEAKER_04]: Play it.

2229
02:41:47,418 --> 02:41:53,200
[SPEAKER_15]: Boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob

2230
02:42:08,547 --> 02:42:10,729
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for watching!

2231
02:42:41,226 --> 02:42:42,871
Thank you for watching!

2232
02:44:01,084 --> 02:44:01,725
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you for watching!

2233
02:46:17,651 --> 02:46:20,513
[SPEAKER_01]: Last week on Orange Lounge Radio.

2234
02:46:20,993 --> 02:46:22,815
[SPEAKER_04]: Who was the last person to put their coin up?

2235
02:46:23,275 --> 02:46:24,576
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going after that person.

2236
02:46:24,616 --> 02:46:25,577
[SPEAKER_04]: The hell with the rest of you.

2237
02:46:25,997 --> 02:46:28,078
[SPEAKER_04]: Although, I almost got killed by a little kid.

2238
02:46:28,218 --> 02:46:30,980
[SPEAKER_04]: I think a little four-year-old threatened to cut me at Stockton Golf Line.

2239
02:46:31,000 --> 02:46:33,622
[SPEAKER_04]: When I got up there and said, I'm playing.

2240
02:46:34,183 --> 02:46:35,624
[SPEAKER_04]: Because this person put their token up.

2241
02:46:35,644 --> 02:46:37,285
[SPEAKER_16]: She started talking about, No, it's mine.

2242
02:46:37,405 --> 02:46:37,725
[SPEAKER_16]: It's mine.

2243
02:46:37,745 --> 02:46:38,506
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going to cut you.

2244
02:46:38,606 --> 02:46:40,227
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going to kill you in the face.

2245
02:46:40,547 --> 02:46:42,288
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going to put my mommy on you.

2246
02:46:42,608 --> 02:46:43,349
[SPEAKER_04]: Where is your mother?

2247
02:46:43,409 --> 02:46:45,631
[SPEAKER_04]: Your mother just left you here for me to babysit you.

2248
02:46:45,671 --> 02:46:46,051
[SPEAKER_04]: Go away.

2249
02:46:54,370 --> 02:46:57,172
[SPEAKER_01]: Join us every Sunday night from 7 p.m.

2250
02:46:57,312 --> 02:46:58,272
[SPEAKER_01]: until 9 p.m.

2251
02:46:58,352 --> 02:47:08,239
[SPEAKER_01]: Pacific Standard Time for the Orange Lounge with your hosts, DarkSakura and Sky, where we'll talk about all things Bomani and then some.

2252
02:47:08,679 --> 02:47:12,141
[SPEAKER_01]: In the meantime, enjoy our Bomani Music and More program.

2253
02:47:12,978 --> 02:47:15,740
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know what the hell these things are that we're playing as we're coming back from break.

2254
02:47:15,760 --> 02:47:18,062
[SPEAKER_22]: Those are the old promos we used to have that have little clips.

2255
02:47:18,563 --> 02:47:22,226
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a good way to hear what we used to talk about on old shows.

2256
02:47:22,606 --> 02:47:25,509
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that was like the second episode of Orange Lounge that clip came from.

2257
02:47:25,869 --> 02:47:26,850
[SPEAKER_14]: I was actually not here.

2258
02:47:27,090 --> 02:47:29,573
[SPEAKER_04]: You weren't here for the first couple episodes.

2259
02:47:30,393 --> 02:47:32,075
[SPEAKER_14]: That was when I was in the gay dorm room.

2260
02:47:32,972 --> 02:47:34,114
[SPEAKER_14]: The Gay Fraternity

2261
02:47:44,608 --> 02:47:45,649
[SPEAKER_06]: And then look at his pupils.

2262
02:47:45,709 --> 02:47:46,729
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, do you have the microphone?

2263
02:47:47,069 --> 02:47:48,570
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you hand Loki the microphone, Christopher?

2264
02:47:48,991 --> 02:47:49,631
[SPEAKER_06]: Make sure it's on there.

2265
02:47:50,171 --> 02:47:50,732
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you feeling?

2266
02:47:50,872 --> 02:47:52,973
[SPEAKER_04]: You threw up again during that break.

2267
02:47:53,073 --> 02:47:59,477
[SPEAKER_24]: I feel... Yeah, I threw up quite a bit that break just because I didn't feel good.

2268
02:47:59,657 --> 02:48:04,560
[SPEAKER_24]: Just probably because I had a lot of, like, you know, a lot of acid beforehand.

2269
02:48:05,340 --> 02:48:09,202
[SPEAKER_23]: I was eating a... He was taking acid beforehand.

2270
02:48:09,823 --> 02:48:13,565
[SPEAKER_23]: And so that's, you know, a lot of tomato soup and that's very acidy, so...

2271
02:48:14,400 --> 02:48:18,485
[SPEAKER_14]: I actually only throw up when I have citrus mixture, so that does make sense.

2272
02:48:19,626 --> 02:48:22,630
[SPEAKER_24]: I just feel really wasted right now.

2273
02:48:22,690 --> 02:48:26,475
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm very tired and not very good.

2274
02:48:26,495 --> 02:48:33,003
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, just, I'm completely out of it, so it's not even funny.

2275
02:48:34,528 --> 02:48:35,748
[SPEAKER_24]: Just out of it.

2276
02:48:36,008 --> 02:48:36,389
Okay.

2277
02:48:36,749 --> 02:48:40,910
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, you can participate as you want to in this next segment.

2278
02:48:41,070 --> 02:48:43,331
[SPEAKER_04]: I will participate as best as I can.

2279
02:48:43,351 --> 02:48:50,633
[SPEAKER_04]: But we figure since our listeners have been so good and putting up with the last hour of this show, which has been kind of crappy.

2280
02:48:52,133 --> 02:48:54,894
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, I completely understand.

2281
02:48:54,954 --> 02:48:58,535
[SPEAKER_04]: This part, actually, some of them are getting kicked out of it, so whatever.

2282
02:48:58,575 --> 02:48:59,836
[SPEAKER_04]: We only do this once in a while for you.

2283
02:49:01,400 --> 02:49:02,561
[SPEAKER_04]: This part of the show is for you.

2284
02:49:02,601 --> 02:49:07,985
[SPEAKER_04]: This is your chance to take the show in any direction you want to by asking Orange Lounge.

2285
02:49:13,650 --> 02:49:16,552
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.

2286
02:49:17,072 --> 02:49:20,335
[SPEAKER_04]: What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?

2287
02:49:20,715 --> 02:49:24,098
[SPEAKER_04]: Will Nellie keep taunting me while I am drunk?

2288
02:49:24,538 --> 02:49:27,781
[SPEAKER_04]: Or will she continue to dance a jig while her boyfriend pukes?

2289
02:49:31,738 --> 02:49:33,940
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't you be talking crap about me.

2290
02:49:33,960 --> 02:49:37,643
[SPEAKER_14]: Rob, that's actually the best opening song you have ever done.

2291
02:49:37,883 --> 02:49:39,885
[SPEAKER_04]: And to think I had to be drunk to improvise that.

2292
02:49:40,365 --> 02:49:43,327
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't believe that I was actually singing in technical public.

2293
02:49:44,508 --> 02:49:46,330
[SPEAKER_14]: Because you know how afraid I am of singing.

2294
02:49:46,903 --> 02:49:54,824
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, if I just breathe in and out very deeply, I can probably become coherent enough to actually answer questions or anything.

2295
02:49:54,844 --> 02:49:58,585
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, this first one's directed towards the one and only DarkSakura, actually.

2296
02:49:58,645 --> 02:49:59,445
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank God for that.

2297
02:49:59,505 --> 02:50:02,146
[SPEAKER_04]: The question comes from DeepThought42.

2298
02:50:02,866 --> 02:50:06,226
[SPEAKER_06]: And now, Deep Thoughts with Jack Handy.

2299
02:50:06,286 --> 02:50:06,747
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, here it is.

2300
02:50:07,007 --> 02:50:07,767
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, are you ready?

2301
02:50:07,947 --> 02:50:10,507
[SPEAKER_14]: We used to go to the cave to see our Uncle Bear.

2302
02:50:11,007 --> 02:50:14,968
[SPEAKER_14]: We called him Uncle Bear because he lived in the cave, and sometimes he'd eat one of us.

2303
02:50:15,686 --> 02:50:17,627
[SPEAKER_14]: Later on, we found out he actually was a bear.

2304
02:50:19,689 --> 02:50:26,873
[SPEAKER_04]: They say that every time a... The face of a child can say it all, especially the mouth part.

2305
02:50:26,913 --> 02:50:30,675
[SPEAKER_06]: They say that every time a bell rings, an angel gets its wings.

2306
02:50:31,076 --> 02:50:35,478
[SPEAKER_06]: But what they don't tell you is, every time a mousetrap snaps, an angel gets set on fire.

2307
02:50:37,099 --> 02:50:37,359
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

2308
02:50:37,520 --> 02:50:38,400
[SPEAKER_04]: I love Deep Thoughts.

2309
02:50:40,121 --> 02:50:44,544
[SPEAKER_04]: Deep Thought 42, you were saying something earlier about how when you're drinking, you become a big cuddle whore.

2310
02:50:45,821 --> 02:50:48,324
[SPEAKER_04]: DeepThought42 wants to know, will Jamie cuddle with me?

2311
02:50:49,705 --> 02:50:51,267
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd have to ask my fiancé.

2312
02:50:52,188 --> 02:50:55,871
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would imagine that DarkSakura has the following requirements.

2313
02:50:56,211 --> 02:50:57,753
[SPEAKER_04]: First of all, you need to have good hygiene.

2314
02:50:57,793 --> 02:50:59,635
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if you have VO, she's not going to cuddle with you.

2315
02:50:59,935 --> 02:51:00,135
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

2316
02:51:00,516 --> 02:51:02,417
[SPEAKER_04]: And second of all...

2317
02:51:03,430 --> 02:51:06,792
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to not be an idiot, because DarkSakura doesn't cuddle with idiots.

2318
02:51:06,912 --> 02:51:07,933
[SPEAKER_14]: And you have to have good grammar.

2319
02:51:08,193 --> 02:51:11,415
[SPEAKER_04]: You are listening to Orange Launch Radio, which is some plus points there.

2320
02:51:11,475 --> 02:51:13,316
[SPEAKER_14]: That proves that you're not a complete idiot.

2321
02:51:13,396 --> 02:51:14,116
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, very good.

2322
02:51:14,156 --> 02:51:19,819
[SPEAKER_14]: But you have to have excellent grammar and great enunciation skills.

2323
02:51:20,380 --> 02:51:20,680
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

2324
02:51:22,141 --> 02:51:23,321
[SPEAKER_04]: Are those like your turn-ons?

2325
02:51:24,582 --> 02:51:27,083
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh my god, grammar makes me so fucking horny!

2326
02:51:29,365 --> 02:51:31,506
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, now I know what clip I'm going to use in the next intro.

2327
02:51:33,482 --> 02:51:40,786
[SPEAKER_13]: And now... And now... And now he just said that monkeys make her horny.

2328
02:51:41,586 --> 02:51:44,367
[SPEAKER_26]: Call 1-900-DARK-SAKURA.

2329
02:51:44,447 --> 02:51:44,868
[SPEAKER_13]: Shut up.

2330
02:51:44,908 --> 02:51:47,049
[SPEAKER_26]: Her turn-ons are good grammar.

2331
02:51:48,409 --> 02:51:50,070
[SPEAKER_26]: And guys that... And Xanadu.

2332
02:51:50,350 --> 02:51:51,691
[SPEAKER_26]: Guys that have good hygiene.

2333
02:51:52,791 --> 02:51:56,234
[SPEAKER_14]: My turn-ons are Electric Light Orchestra and Good Grammar.

2334
02:51:56,254 --> 02:52:00,618
[SPEAKER_04]: I get off on Sesame Street, yo.

2335
02:52:01,919 --> 02:52:02,880
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki passed out.

2336
02:52:04,601 --> 02:52:07,984
[SPEAKER_04]: Please stop with the talking about what turn-ons are.

2337
02:52:08,004 --> 02:52:10,446
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, as soon as he stops using the letter U instead of Y-O-U.

2338
02:52:10,466 --> 02:52:10,666
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, um...

2339
02:52:18,493 --> 02:52:19,654
[SPEAKER_04]: Ron Chan has a question.

2340
02:52:19,794 --> 02:52:23,856
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to get this alcohol out of my system ASAP.

2341
02:52:23,896 --> 02:52:26,178
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to be saving your energy for the podcast.

2342
02:52:27,038 --> 02:52:27,899
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, whatever.

2343
02:52:27,939 --> 02:52:28,939
[SPEAKER_04]: Ron Chan has a question.

2344
02:52:29,340 --> 02:52:30,320
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's my question.

2345
02:52:30,360 --> 02:52:32,902
[SPEAKER_04]: You said on the podcast that Bomberman DS was $20.

2346
02:52:33,963 --> 02:52:35,183
[SPEAKER_04]: Where the hell did you find it for $20?

2347
02:52:35,243 --> 02:52:37,545
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I sure as hell couldn't.

2348
02:52:37,565 --> 02:52:40,146
[SPEAKER_04]: That was actually Miklatov that ended up buying that for $20.

2349
02:52:40,226 --> 02:52:47,411
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know where he bought it, but knowing him, it was probably EB Games or GameStop, one of the two, because he used to work for EB Games before he was at Konami.

2350
02:52:48,091 --> 02:52:50,634
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, who else sells?

2351
02:52:50,774 --> 02:52:51,394
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, you know what?

2352
02:52:51,454 --> 02:52:54,797
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw a good deal on Meteos at Target, of all places.

2353
02:52:54,897 --> 02:52:58,400
[SPEAKER_04]: They only wanted $29.99 as opposed to $39.99 for it, so that was good.

2354
02:52:59,001 --> 02:53:00,862
[SPEAKER_04]: So, shop around.

2355
02:53:00,943 --> 02:53:05,046
[SPEAKER_04]: Check Frugal as a part of Google, if nothing else, and you'll find a good deal there.

2356
02:53:05,386 --> 02:53:11,211
[SPEAKER_04]: From what I understand, though, and you're probably a little late for this, but Circuit City apparently had a really good deal on video games today.

2357
02:53:11,992 --> 02:53:18,154
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, they were selling $10 video games today, like Amplitude, and what's that GameCube role-playing game, Bighton Kaitos or whatever?

2358
02:53:18,634 --> 02:53:20,155
[SPEAKER_04]: Those were all like $10 today.

2359
02:53:20,295 --> 02:53:20,915
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty cool, huh?

2360
02:53:22,916 --> 02:53:23,176
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

2361
02:53:26,097 --> 02:53:29,818
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, DeepThought42 wants you to know that his father is an English professor.

2362
02:53:30,498 --> 02:53:31,119
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, English.

2363
02:53:31,459 --> 02:53:31,799
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm drunk.

2364
02:53:32,519 --> 02:53:34,080
[SPEAKER_04]: His father is an English professor.

2365
02:53:35,260 --> 02:53:36,601
[SPEAKER_14]: That's awfully tempting.

2366
02:53:36,621 --> 02:53:37,441
[SPEAKER_14]: That's pretty hot.

2367
02:53:37,541 --> 02:53:40,262
[SPEAKER_14]: However, I am highly taken.

2368
02:53:41,042 --> 02:53:42,683
[SPEAKER_14]: My fiance is excellent.

2369
02:53:42,763 --> 02:53:44,284
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a cuddle.

2370
02:53:44,745 --> 02:53:45,505
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a cuddle.

2371
02:53:46,066 --> 02:53:47,086
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not making out.

2372
02:53:47,147 --> 02:53:47,887
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not sex.

2373
02:53:47,987 --> 02:53:48,287
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2374
02:53:49,248 --> 02:53:59,255
[SPEAKER_04]: VidPowell wants to know, is the OLR crew doing anything worth mentioning on the 4th of July?

2375
02:53:59,756 --> 02:54:01,457
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm eating me some meat!

2376
02:54:01,777 --> 02:54:03,778
[SPEAKER_04]: We know Loki has to deal with his family tomorrow.

2377
02:54:04,919 --> 02:54:06,100
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, my God.

2378
02:54:06,120 --> 02:54:07,601
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry.

2379
02:54:07,701 --> 02:54:08,362
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, my car.

2380
02:54:08,722 --> 02:54:09,683
[SPEAKER_14]: Because my car is gone.

2381
02:54:10,680 --> 02:54:12,962
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm so dizzy right now, it's so funny.

2382
02:54:12,982 --> 02:54:14,783
[SPEAKER_24]: Are you going to barf because I need to go back to the bathroom?

2383
02:54:14,823 --> 02:54:17,604
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm not going to throw up, no, I'm just really dizzy.

2384
02:54:18,505 --> 02:54:22,407
[SPEAKER_24]: If I take, if my stomach is fine, I'll be fine.

2385
02:54:23,928 --> 02:54:25,029
[SPEAKER_14]: You look kind of bloated.

2386
02:54:26,990 --> 02:54:28,071
[SPEAKER_16]: Seriously!

2387
02:54:28,631 --> 02:54:33,114
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, what is the first thing that alcohol does that makes you brutally honest with everybody?

2388
02:54:33,914 --> 02:54:36,596
[SPEAKER_14]: Sort of like how, what was it Margaret Cho said about grappa?

2389
02:54:37,617 --> 02:54:38,597
[SPEAKER_14]: You have that skin!

2390
02:54:40,129 --> 02:54:40,850
[SPEAKER_14]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2391
02:55:10,814 --> 02:55:13,295
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank God, because this show is really starting to go downhill fast.

2392
02:55:13,715 --> 02:55:18,136
[SPEAKER_04]: So now we're going to go around and get everybody, and now we're going to try and tape a podcast.

2393
02:55:18,176 --> 02:55:19,037
[SPEAKER_04]: That should be tons of fun.

2394
02:55:19,557 --> 02:55:22,458
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we're going to go around and get everybody's final thought.

2395
02:55:23,538 --> 02:55:26,539
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, why don't you start us off, because you're the most sober out of everybody.

2396
02:55:26,559 --> 02:55:27,319
[SPEAKER_04]: What's your final thought?

2397
02:55:27,779 --> 02:55:29,300
[SPEAKER_14]: Reject false icons.

2398
02:55:31,260 --> 02:55:32,561
[SPEAKER_04]: Extaper, do you have a final thought?

2399
02:55:32,961 --> 02:55:33,421
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't hide.

2400
02:55:33,761 --> 02:55:35,262
[SPEAKER_04]: Come here, Extaper, do you have a final thought?

2401
02:55:36,862 --> 02:55:39,203
[SPEAKER_04]: I am not drunk and I don't have a final thought.

2402
02:55:39,323 --> 02:55:39,783
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

2403
02:55:40,782 --> 02:55:41,142
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.

2404
02:55:42,423 --> 02:55:43,404
[SPEAKER_04]: Nellie, what's your final thought?

2405
02:55:44,745 --> 02:55:46,246
[SPEAKER_09]: We are not coming back over here.

2406
02:55:49,569 --> 02:55:53,112
[SPEAKER_04]: And my final thought is, remember kids, don't drink and drive.

2407
02:55:53,973 --> 02:55:55,594
[SPEAKER_04]: And Loki, your final thought?

2408
02:55:56,635 --> 02:55:57,936
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want any more alcohol.

2409
02:55:58,717 --> 02:55:58,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Ever?

2410
02:55:58,997 --> 02:56:01,719
[SPEAKER_04]: At least this week.

2411
02:56:01,959 --> 02:56:02,280
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2412
02:56:02,700 --> 02:56:03,461
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the spirit.

2413
02:56:04,722 --> 02:56:05,042
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2414
02:56:05,939 --> 02:56:14,136
[SPEAKER_04]: The final word of the show One word to sum it all up Thank you guys for listening by the way And big hugs and kisses And if this was your first show tonight Seriously guys

2415
02:56:15,236 --> 02:56:17,118
[SPEAKER_04]: This isn't what it's normally like.

2416
02:56:17,158 --> 02:56:18,839
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry to see your first show.

2417
02:56:19,480 --> 02:56:22,242
[SPEAKER_04]: We normally are not drunken louts on the show.

2418
02:56:22,302 --> 02:56:28,407
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't even think that because of the iTunes thing, we'd have way more listeners this week, meaning we'd have way more people who are listening to the show the first time.

2419
02:56:29,087 --> 02:56:31,710
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoops, that was a bad calculation on when to do a drunk show.

2420
02:56:32,410 --> 02:56:32,790
[SPEAKER_04]: My bad.

2421
02:56:32,831 --> 02:56:39,416
[SPEAKER_14]: We did the drunk show because, first of all, it is our three-year anniversary, plus it is also a three-day weekend.

2422
02:56:39,456 --> 02:56:40,797
[SPEAKER_14]: We were taking advantage of it.

2423
02:56:41,338 --> 02:56:43,980
[SPEAKER_14]: Every three-day weekend that comes up, we usually get pissed.

2424
02:56:45,219 --> 02:56:47,280
[SPEAKER_14]: So, again, tune in next week.

2425
02:56:47,320 --> 02:56:48,360
[SPEAKER_14]: Give us one more chance.

2426
02:56:48,560 --> 02:56:50,200
[SPEAKER_14]: I swear we will be sober.

2427
02:56:50,700 --> 02:56:55,342
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki will probably be highly embarrassed because his family's been listening to him drunk on the show.

2428
02:56:56,382 --> 02:57:00,443
[SPEAKER_14]: And we'll be full of our usual, you know, piss and angst next week.

2429
02:57:02,744 --> 02:57:04,324
[SPEAKER_04]: Really quick last minute questions.

2430
02:57:04,824 --> 02:57:06,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, just one from Dirty Thief.

2431
02:57:06,745 --> 02:57:07,565
[SPEAKER_04]: See, another new name.

2432
02:57:07,625 --> 02:57:08,385
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't recognize his name.

2433
02:57:08,885 --> 02:57:11,606
[SPEAKER_04]: Can Loki share with us his family reactions on the next show?

2434
02:57:13,433 --> 02:57:14,854
[SPEAKER_04]: Nelly says she'll do it, if nothing else.

2435
02:57:15,935 --> 02:57:17,237
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki's reaching for the microphone.

2436
02:57:18,298 --> 02:57:27,306
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, my reaction is probably to my family is going to be, they'll be, like, surprised that I'm drunk on this show, but they'll probably understand this is a three-day weekend.

2437
02:57:27,507 --> 02:57:28,768
[SPEAKER_23]: It's just a radio show.

2438
02:57:28,788 --> 02:57:33,052
[SPEAKER_23]: Other than that, you know, they'll just be like, I can't believe we heard you're drunk.

2439
02:57:34,173 --> 02:57:35,834
[SPEAKER_14]: He's going to sleep so well tonight.

2440
02:57:35,914 --> 02:57:39,916
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm just really tired right now and I don't feel so good.

2441
02:57:41,137 --> 02:57:47,621
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm just going to try to deal with this alcohol as best I can without making a mess of the apartment.

2442
02:57:49,342 --> 02:57:50,683
[SPEAKER_04]: Final word of the show.

2443
02:57:51,443 --> 02:57:53,144
[SPEAKER_04]: One word to sum it all up.

2444
02:57:53,944 --> 02:57:57,547
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, pick that microphone back up and give us one word that sums it all up.

2445
02:57:57,567 --> 02:57:58,227
[SPEAKER_04]: See you next week, everybody.

2446
02:57:59,844 --> 02:58:02,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't drink and drive, it's really bad.

[SPEAKER_00]: Captain caught me on the holodeck with a lightsaber in my hand And I knew right then I was in for a red shirt reprimand I was trying to think of something to say but my Vader helmet gave me away And the captain looked at me and said Can't use the force, put the fucking lightsaber away
