00:00.442 --> 00:03.483
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of July 11th, 2005.

00:03.643 --> 00:14.045
[SPEAKER_00]: You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.

00:14.365 --> 00:18.186
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.

00:19.246 --> 00:21.606
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, everybody, once again.

00:22.227 --> 00:29.208
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, that podcast dedicated to video games that don't suck.

00:30.006 --> 00:30.687
[SPEAKER_03]: The One and Only, Loki

00:58.410 --> 01:01.192
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I am here and I'm sober this time.

01:01.292 --> 01:02.072
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, you are.

01:02.152 --> 01:03.733
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you feeling after last week's show?

01:03.773 --> 01:04.314
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel fine.

01:04.474 --> 01:09.577
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, after, really, you know, the next day I woke up, I did not remember the podcast.

01:09.817 --> 01:13.659
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember doing a podcast, but I didn't remember anything from the beginning to the end.

01:13.980 --> 01:17.642
[SPEAKER_02]: So I actually had to listen to the podcast to figure out what I said.

01:18.240 --> 01:19.981
[SPEAKER_02]: and what I said was basically a lot of rambling.

01:20.361 --> 01:26.123
[SPEAKER_02]: But when I wasn't repeating myself three times in a row, I was pretty... But you always ramble.

01:27.263 --> 01:27.784
[SPEAKER_02]: More so.

01:29.124 --> 01:29.804
[SPEAKER_03]: It was pretty bad.

01:30.465 --> 01:32.045
[SPEAKER_01]: You were very random and it was hilarious.

01:32.085 --> 01:33.746
[SPEAKER_03]: We got some concerned emails.

01:33.786 --> 01:36.367
[SPEAKER_03]: I want our listeners to know he's okay.

01:36.487 --> 01:36.987
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm okay.

01:37.287 --> 01:41.649
[SPEAKER_02]: What happened was I drank a little bit more than I thought I actually had been drinking.

01:42.011 --> 01:43.192
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't go the whole way, like Loki did.

02:09.298 --> 02:10.278
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh well, lessons learned.

02:10.318 --> 02:12.359
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good thing you didn't end up going to the hospital, young man.

02:13.439 --> 02:16.540
[SPEAKER_01]: Seriously, I was thinking that you might have had, like, alcohol poisoning.

02:17.481 --> 02:19.601
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, he did to some extent, because that's what causes you to go bleh.

02:19.621 --> 02:22.943
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, but I mean... Anyway, let's move on to the games.

02:22.963 --> 02:23.983
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that chick on The Real World.

02:24.923 --> 02:26.044
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't watch crap.

02:26.204 --> 02:26.484
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on.

02:26.504 --> 02:28.885
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a long time ago, and I caught the first episode by accident.

02:29.385 --> 02:30.345
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought you didn't watch TV.

02:30.365 --> 02:31.305
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a shocker to me.

02:31.786 --> 02:32.986
[SPEAKER_01]: This was a long time ago.

02:33.086 --> 02:33.686
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay, okay.

02:33.766 --> 02:34.787
[SPEAKER_03]: And MTV, nonetheless!

02:35.047 --> 02:35.387
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I know.

02:35.487 --> 02:35.867
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand.

02:36.445 --> 02:36.705
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura

02:57.702 --> 03:00.564
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been playing Buy the Washer and Dryer and Refrigerator game.

03:01.445 --> 03:04.127
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to get a Game Boy or something to play.

03:04.147 --> 03:06.909
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you probably have a Game Boy, a WonderSwan.

03:06.929 --> 03:07.829
[SPEAKER_01]: They're in boxes!

03:08.790 --> 03:12.273
[SPEAKER_01]: But we did buy a 50-inch widescreen HDTV.

03:12.533 --> 03:12.913
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember.

03:12.953 --> 03:14.474
[SPEAKER_03]: You briefly touched on that last week.

03:14.494 --> 03:16.295
[SPEAKER_01]: This is sexy.

03:16.516 --> 03:17.516
[SPEAKER_03]: How do the games look on it?

03:17.877 --> 03:19.298
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't hooked anything up yet.

03:19.618 --> 03:20.599
[SPEAKER_01]: They're in boxes!

03:20.899 --> 03:22.160
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are your priorities?

03:23.000 --> 03:26.283
[SPEAKER_01]: My priorities have been going to work...

03:27.572 --> 03:30.455
[SPEAKER_01]: and buying a washer and dryer so that I don't have dirty clothes.

03:30.636 --> 03:31.336
[SPEAKER_03]: Fine.

03:31.356 --> 03:36.082
[SPEAKER_01]: And a refrigerator so that I have food that doesn't go bad, that I can't eat any of.

03:37.363 --> 03:38.024
[SPEAKER_03]: Fine, fine.

03:38.624 --> 03:40.086
[SPEAKER_03]: Gamers gotta have priorities too.

03:40.146 --> 03:41.768
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's find out then what Loki's been up to.

03:41.788 --> 03:42.549
[SPEAKER_02]: What have you been up to, Loki?

03:42.629 --> 03:44.071
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been playing a lot of stuff, actually.

03:45.152 --> 03:48.736
[SPEAKER_02]: The first game I started off with this week was Mercury for the PSP.

03:49.677 --> 03:51.720
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'm happy to say it sucked ass.

03:51.740 --> 03:52.681
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

03:53.182 --> 03:55.405
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was a complete disappointment.

03:55.966 --> 03:57.668
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not what you think.

03:57.808 --> 04:00.332
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a puzzle game, but I was bored.

04:00.652 --> 04:03.216
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just completely retarded and I was just...

04:03.752 --> 04:07.074
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank God, you know, I was borrowing it and not buying it.

04:07.535 --> 04:10.016
[SPEAKER_02]: That's two puzzlers now on PSP you haven't liked.

04:10.156 --> 04:11.317
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's the same thing.

04:11.477 --> 04:12.718
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of load time also.

04:12.938 --> 04:14.619
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, what the hell's wrong with these people?

04:14.900 --> 04:17.021
[SPEAKER_02]: But it sucks, so don't buy it.

04:18.162 --> 04:21.344
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I played Coded Arms for the PSP.

04:21.844 --> 04:24.946
[SPEAKER_02]: PSP's first first-person shooter, and it's awesome.

04:26.067 --> 04:26.968
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really awesome.

04:27.408 --> 04:32.892
[SPEAKER_02]: The controls, they tried to do the best they could at the PSP, being that it only has one analog stick, so the other

04:33.444 --> 04:38.566
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, looking around is used with the four buttons, which isn't quite good.

04:38.906 --> 04:41.688
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not as smooth as I would have liked it to have been.

04:42.188 --> 04:45.309
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, it's the best they can really do for the PSP.

04:45.449 --> 04:46.430
[SPEAKER_02]: So they made the best of it.

04:46.470 --> 04:48.150
[SPEAKER_02]: But other than that, it's okay.

04:48.471 --> 04:51.332
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish there was another analog stick on the PSP, then it would have been perfect.

04:51.732 --> 04:53.913
[SPEAKER_03]: What makes it so great, then, since you're only complaining about the controls?

04:53.933 --> 04:55.053
[SPEAKER_02]: Just the graphics are really good.

04:55.134 --> 04:56.734
[SPEAKER_02]: The game's just put together really well.

04:56.894 --> 04:59.856
[SPEAKER_02]: I was surprised on how well the graphics were.

05:00.036 --> 05:02.617
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like a lot of fun, actually.

05:04.597 --> 05:09.558
[SPEAKER_02]: The other game I played was Puzzle Bobble for the PSP, which is a Japanese import.

05:09.678 --> 05:11.499
[SPEAKER_02]: Not telling you how I got that one.

05:12.639 --> 05:15.740
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like Puzzle Bobble, no surprise there.

05:16.200 --> 05:19.460
[SPEAKER_03]: It's every system's mandatory Puzzle Bobble release in one way or another.

05:19.680 --> 05:20.080
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good.

05:20.621 --> 05:24.721
[SPEAKER_03]: I know DarkSakura's going to yell at me for this, but a lot of you folks know it as Bust a Move.

05:26.562 --> 05:27.922
[SPEAKER_04]: Puzzle Bobble.

05:28.342 --> 05:32.103
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just saying, the American name was Bust a Move despite how you feel about Bust a Groove.

05:32.864 --> 05:33.444
[SPEAKER_03]: and all that stuff.

05:33.544 --> 05:38.127
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, moving away from the handheld systems, I bought Killer7.

05:39.067 --> 05:39.568
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great.

05:39.588 --> 05:40.928
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a very psychotic game.

05:41.388 --> 05:45.271
[SPEAKER_02]: The storyline, the game, it seems very anime-like to me.

05:46.291 --> 05:46.851
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the setup?

05:46.951 --> 05:50.713
[SPEAKER_02]: The setup basically is, I mean, they don't really tell you much in the beginning.

05:50.853 --> 05:52.334
[SPEAKER_02]: You're this group of assassins.

05:52.394 --> 05:57.457
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, this guy, Harmon Smith, he's this wheelchair-bound assassin who has...

05:57.864 --> 05:58.265
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

06:11.016 --> 06:26.029
[SPEAKER_02]: There's, you know, you're not really sure if, you know, he's in the, if it's in the physical form or not, and what they make you, what they kind of lead you to believe is that you yourself, the player, are another one of his personalities, which is great.

06:26.310 --> 06:31.194
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was really neat, and it's just, the storyline's very rich and just like full of

06:32.243 --> 06:33.785
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, a lot of detail and stuff.

06:33.825 --> 06:36.267
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've only played, you know, to the second level so far.

06:36.587 --> 06:39.449
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a lot of really crazy shit in there.

06:39.510 --> 06:41.191
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, like, they're laughing.

06:41.271 --> 06:46.676
[SPEAKER_02]: The main villain or the enemies that you encounter are called these things called Heaven Smile.

06:46.936 --> 06:48.117
[SPEAKER_02]: And they look like these zombies.

06:48.157 --> 06:51.980
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have these giant, like, grins on them.

06:52.020 --> 06:53.461
[SPEAKER_02]: And they just go, ha, ha, ha.

06:53.622 --> 06:54.262
[SPEAKER_02]: And they laugh.

06:55.163 --> 06:56.924
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a weird laugh.

06:57.065 --> 06:58.085
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they've got, like...

06:59.444 --> 07:05.907
[SPEAKER_02]: You shoot them and you collect the blood from them and you use the blood to... It's like that one game, Nano Breaker.

07:06.167 --> 07:06.607
[SPEAKER_02]: Sort of.

07:06.948 --> 07:07.688
[SPEAKER_03]: Oil, sorry.

07:08.028 --> 07:10.189
[SPEAKER_02]: Sort of, but this is actually blood.

07:10.970 --> 07:12.070
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really strange.

07:12.290 --> 07:13.731
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole game is very psychotic.

07:13.751 --> 07:14.971
[SPEAKER_03]: How's that graphical look?

07:15.011 --> 07:16.892
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good.

07:16.912 --> 07:18.953
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all cel-shaded, but it's done really well.

07:19.233 --> 07:22.655
[SPEAKER_02]: The cutscenes are in anime.

07:23.075 --> 07:24.116
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really interesting.

07:24.516 --> 07:26.757
[SPEAKER_02]: They give you a lot of background about the characters and stuff.

07:27.168 --> 07:29.549
[SPEAKER_02]: But the whole game, I still don't really know what's going on yet.

07:29.589 --> 07:31.149
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the whole point.

07:31.369 --> 07:33.190
[SPEAKER_02]: You feel psychotic playing this game.

07:33.270 --> 07:34.330
[SPEAKER_03]: So do you recommend this one?

07:34.370 --> 07:34.871
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

07:35.051 --> 07:36.171
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very different game.

07:36.231 --> 07:39.532
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a storyline that's about as deep as Silent Hill.

07:39.752 --> 07:46.054
[SPEAKER_02]: And it plays, to me, I mean, everyone's knocking the rail system where you're running around limited movement.

07:46.294 --> 07:48.715
[SPEAKER_02]: But it plays, to me, sort of like Alone in the Dark.

07:48.975 --> 07:50.736
[SPEAKER_02]: There's puzzle solving and stuff like that.

07:51.739 --> 07:54.042
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of Silent Hill, since you brought it up, I have to put this in real fast.

07:54.063 --> 07:55.825
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been following what's going on with the movie.

07:56.306 --> 07:59.210
[SPEAKER_03]: They're putting Pyramid Head from Silent Hill 2 is going to be in the movie.

08:00.592 --> 08:01.273
[SPEAKER_04]: Get this.

08:02.235 --> 08:06.361
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is just going to let you know, oh my gosh, we might get a video game movie done right in every way.

08:07.001 --> 08:08.783
[SPEAKER_03]: and Akira Yamaoka is producing the soundtrack.

08:10.044 --> 08:10.384
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

08:10.524 --> 08:12.846
[SPEAKER_03]: And Akira Yamaoka actually did the music for the Silent Hills.

08:13.106 --> 08:15.188
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're not violating that.

08:15.268 --> 08:20.632
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, I was going to have a problem with Silent Hill with Akira Yamaoka because half of Silent Hill is the mood of the music and everything.

08:20.672 --> 08:22.353
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm just very excited for this movie now.

08:22.593 --> 08:24.215
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's incredible.

08:24.375 --> 08:26.877
[SPEAKER_02]: The music and mood of this game is really weird too.

08:26.997 --> 08:30.359
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, it's really, you've got to play Killer7.

08:30.480 --> 08:31.580
[SPEAKER_02]: At least rent it once.

08:31.721 --> 08:33.782
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just so strange.

08:33.942 --> 08:34.883
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, you've got to play it.

08:35.626 --> 08:36.927
[SPEAKER_02]: Dear Yamaoka-san, I love you, I love you, I love you.

08:48.624 --> 08:51.727
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.

08:51.787 --> 08:52.988
[SPEAKER_03]: We are not above groveling.

08:53.048 --> 08:53.649
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, Loki.

08:53.749 --> 08:59.234
[SPEAKER_02]: Other than that, I won a free PSP, and I ended up selling it for about $150.

09:00.095 --> 09:04.859
[SPEAKER_02]: But I sold it to someone that's in our company, and I'm also going to get the hookup from them.

09:04.879 --> 09:08.002
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to give me a copy as soon as they get it of Advent Children.

09:08.462 --> 09:09.363
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe a UMD.

09:09.503 --> 09:10.424
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

09:10.544 --> 09:10.905
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

09:11.265 --> 09:13.647
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had to knock the price down for them.

09:13.667 --> 09:13.988
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

09:14.648 --> 09:16.969
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but, uh, yeah, that's pretty much all I've been doing.

09:16.989 --> 09:19.230
[SPEAKER_02]: Killer7's awesome, and I'm gonna play all the way through it.

09:19.270 --> 09:21.471
[SPEAKER_02]: Destroy All Humans, I've already beat it, and it was fun.

09:21.811 --> 09:26.494
[SPEAKER_02]: How was, without giving away the ending, were you, I heard, I heard rumors that the ending was a bit of a letdown.

09:27.354 --> 09:29.455
[SPEAKER_02]: Eh, it's your typical ending for a game.

09:29.595 --> 09:32.837
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't like, I, there really, there's not high expectations.

09:32.857 --> 09:40.020
[SPEAKER_02]: The, the end of the game, you have, like, two boss fights, and that's kind of weird, because there's no boss fights throughout the whole game, and then you fight these two bosses, and it's like,

09:40.720 --> 09:46.024
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, they're a little bit stronger than they should be, but this is retarded.

09:46.524 --> 09:52.049
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole point of the game is that you've got the same guy that does the voice acting for Zim, and he's in it, and it's great.

09:52.109 --> 09:52.849
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I love about it.

09:52.869 --> 09:53.129
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, good.

09:53.190 --> 09:54.410
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that you're done with it, I can borrow it.

09:54.511 --> 09:55.131
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the important thing.

09:55.671 --> 09:57.453
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you can't, because you don't have a US PlayStation 2.

09:58.274 --> 09:59.556
[SPEAKER_03]: I will very soon.

09:59.736 --> 10:02.640
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm working on that because I'm sick of having only a Japanese one.

10:02.680 --> 10:12.713
[SPEAKER_03]: Although I'll tell you what, if I had a Japanese PlayStation, or if I had the drive, I do have a Japanese PlayStation 2, if I had the money to import, I would have imported We Heart Katamari this week.

10:13.234 --> 10:14.294
[SPEAKER_03]: It was released in Japan.

10:14.434 --> 10:15.015
[SPEAKER_03]: It's awesome.

10:15.255 --> 10:18.136
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually want to play little bits from the soundtrack for you guys.

10:18.156 --> 10:23.678
[SPEAKER_03]: Just little, little snippets because, you know, playing music in podcasts is, you know, I don't know, it's questionable.

10:23.718 --> 10:28.880
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't think they'll mind the free plug if we just play a little snippet here from the soundtrack.

10:28.920 --> 10:31.961
[SPEAKER_03]: So what I want to play for you guys is a little snippet.

10:32.381 --> 10:33.501
[SPEAKER_03]: First off, you have to hear this.

10:34.361 --> 10:35.002
[SPEAKER_03]: This is great.

10:35.042 --> 10:38.023
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the training music in the new We Heart Katamari.

10:38.323 --> 10:39.523
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like beatboxing.

10:39.563 --> 10:41.064
[SPEAKER_03]: It's this Japanese beatbox guy.

10:41.084 --> 10:41.504
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen to this.

10:56.677 --> 10:57.378
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you expect?

10:57.458 --> 11:03.523
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the kind of thing you'd expect from the sequel to Katamari Damacy, so I'm not disappointed at all.

11:03.543 --> 11:05.084
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the game, just the premise of the game.

11:05.204 --> 11:08.467
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically the Prince of the Cosmos or whatever.

11:09.868 --> 11:13.351
[SPEAKER_02]: He's doing stuff for the fans of the previous game.

11:13.451 --> 11:14.612
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the story of the game.

11:14.632 --> 11:15.193
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cute.

11:15.353 --> 11:15.873
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's another one.

11:15.893 --> 11:17.795
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a quick snippet from the introduction of the game.

11:25.959 --> 11:29.182
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see Katamari Damacy, The Broadway Show

11:49.437 --> 11:50.178
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

12:08.277 --> 12:08.917
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

12:24.989 --> 12:40.542
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure the game is great if you're into that kind of thing because it's definitely a pretty looking game and a lot of the elements in it are very cool like they have like the voting with page up and down and just the aspect of it the setup is really good but honestly me personally I just couldn't get into it like it was seriously one of those things where I'm just like

12:41.306 --> 12:44.188
[SPEAKER_03]: I really want to like this game, but it's just not my thing.

12:44.268 --> 12:45.629
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't get into this.

12:46.210 --> 12:49.852
[SPEAKER_03]: My feeble brain cannot handle this game for some reason because I kept shooting my own guys.

12:50.052 --> 12:50.773
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

12:50.813 --> 12:52.594
[SPEAKER_02]: I just didn't get it.

12:52.674 --> 12:57.197
[SPEAKER_02]: One more addition to the Killer7 thing, just to tell you how crazy it is.

12:57.578 --> 13:00.180
[SPEAKER_02]: You talk to a severed head a lot of times.

13:00.200 --> 13:01.280
[SPEAKER_03]: That has nothing to do with what I'm talking about.

13:01.300 --> 13:01.661
[SPEAKER_03]: You're done.

13:01.701 --> 13:02.021
[SPEAKER_03]: You're done.

13:03.007 --> 13:10.257
[SPEAKER_03]: But Battlefield 2, my only disappointment with it, I'm sure it's a fun game if you're into the games, and it would be a great party game.

13:11.338 --> 13:12.500
[SPEAKER_03]: I gotta try that still.

13:12.540 --> 13:19.069
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not gonna give a final verdict on the game until I can really play it with some other live people, except I don't know who in their right mind would want to play that game with me because I'm awful at it.

13:19.509 --> 13:48.125
[SPEAKER_03]: but um my only disappointment is that I actually expected the graphics to be even was considering the system requirements for that game oh my gosh it's like you have to have a 1.7 gig machine and all this stuff crazy high-end video card um luckily I have a lot of that stuff but I would I was kind of expecting the game to look better maybe I just didn't get far enough in it though so I'm kind of I'm not gonna dog on it for the graphics I mean it is a nice looking game it's just I would have expected it to be the best darn thing I've ever seen considering the

13:49.155 --> 13:49.956
[SPEAKER_03]: technical requirements.

13:50.236 --> 13:52.458
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's my half-assed review of Battlefield 2.

13:52.698 --> 13:54.159
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I tried for you guys.

13:54.219 --> 13:56.221
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried to play a War Sim game and get into it.

13:56.581 --> 13:57.902
[SPEAKER_03]: Just couldn't do it.

13:58.362 --> 14:02.385
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll stick with Techie.

14:03.366 --> 14:04.046
[SPEAKER_01]: What was that game?

14:04.466 --> 14:05.968
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember the English name of it now.

14:07.389 --> 14:10.491
[SPEAKER_01]: With the huge controller that I got Dan.

14:10.962 --> 14:13.344
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, the MechWarrior?

14:13.684 --> 14:14.165
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

14:14.425 --> 14:14.986
[SPEAKER_03]: MechAssault.

14:15.446 --> 14:18.168
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that controller didn't go to MechAssault.

14:18.889 --> 14:20.851
[SPEAKER_01]: It was Steel Battalion.

14:21.331 --> 14:22.252
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's it.

14:22.532 --> 14:25.094
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll stick with Steel Battalion because it has an eject button.

14:25.795 --> 14:26.716
[SPEAKER_03]: The eject button was cool.

14:27.516 --> 14:29.478
[SPEAKER_03]: Dahlia Gillespie, Alessa Gillespie Officer Gucci

14:56.755 --> 15:03.238
[SPEAKER_01]: and someone named Sharon and a bunch of... The only actors in here I've really heard of is Sean Bean, which is pretty cool, because he can be wicked.

15:04.739 --> 15:06.759
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so more to come on the Silent Hill movie as we get it.

15:06.779 --> 15:08.240
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get into some other gaming news.

15:08.620 --> 15:10.701
[SPEAKER_03]: First off, I think this is very interesting.

15:11.221 --> 15:25.548
[SPEAKER_03]: The makers of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, Rockstar Games, is being held under the microscope right now by the ESRB, and what this whole thing centers around is basically the sex mod, which some of you guys... I think we've talked about it on this show previously.

15:25.568 --> 15:25.788
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

15:26.648 --> 15:30.329
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, you're that hack crack guy, tell us about, set up this sex mod, how does this work?

15:30.349 --> 15:54.533
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, basically there's unfinished code that's in the game, or basically locked out code, and, you know, people being, you know, the hackers that they are looking through the code, they found it, and so they enable it back in the game, much like how with Grand Theft Auto's, or not San Andreas, Vice City and stuff, they had, they're working on Multi Theft Auto, which is using the multiplayer code that was in there to, you know, play online.

15:54.946 --> 15:55.667
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

16:11.484 --> 16:13.506
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, that's what the whole fuss is about.

16:13.826 --> 16:16.548
[SPEAKER_02]: And apparently it is very graphic from the video that I've seen.

16:16.588 --> 16:17.449
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't done that yet.

16:17.469 --> 16:20.291
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, DarkSakura, you found a site with pictures and stuff?

16:20.331 --> 16:21.792
[SPEAKER_03]: What did you find out about this?

16:22.192 --> 16:23.293
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually closed it.

16:24.894 --> 16:28.937
[SPEAKER_01]: It just had three positions and showed pictures of them all.

16:30.158 --> 16:36.363
[SPEAKER_01]: But it also gave a link to the site how to get to said mod.

16:36.403 --> 16:37.504
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me a second, I'll get it up again.

16:37.624 --> 16:37.764
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

16:38.120 --> 16:42.625
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, you can download it on the major Grand Theft Auto mod sites.

16:43.165 --> 16:46.068
[SPEAKER_02]: And it starts off, where are you going?

16:46.168 --> 16:47.189
[SPEAKER_02]: For coffee.

16:47.830 --> 16:52.254
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the woman orally pleasures you.

16:52.274 --> 16:53.495
[SPEAKER_02]: We get it, we get it, we get it.

16:54.456 --> 16:55.317
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very graphic.

16:55.437 --> 16:58.841
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, hmm, well, yeah, that would be pushing the envelope there, wouldn't it?

17:00.502 --> 17:08.249
[SPEAKER_01]: Where I found the pictures was on ukresistance.co.uk for the June 2005 news.

17:09.850 --> 17:10.450
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, pictures there.

17:11.131 --> 17:15.695
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and the ESRB is now kind of looking going, you know, should this be an adults only game?

17:15.715 --> 17:26.004
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the California Assemblyman Leland Yee is saying that this, basically he's kind of pushing behind this too, that the game should be rated adults only.

17:26.304 --> 17:27.786
[SPEAKER_03]: And the ESRB needs to take another look at this.

17:27.866 --> 17:28.006
[SPEAKER_03]: But

17:28.945 --> 17:50.440
[SPEAKER_03]: I what the ESRB has to look at is did Rockstar sneak this by were they intending this to be a part of the game and I say if you have had to mod or crack the game no it's not it's unfinished stuff it's just like how there was a skateboard weapon and people have unlocked the skateboard weapon it's code that was in there that's unfinished and they they took it out and it's the same thing

17:51.254 --> 18:03.961
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I brought up on our live show, there was Bloody War 3, all the little pictures hidden in the game, that if you put in the debug code by using a GameShark or Game Genie, lo and behold.

18:03.981 --> 18:12.365
[SPEAKER_03]: And as one of you guys brought up on the live show as well, the nude patch for the Sims, EA didn't get sued over that because that was something that was out of their control.

18:12.726 --> 18:13.186
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

18:13.866 --> 18:14.286
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

18:14.386 --> 18:19.209
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, even though they accidentally left the code in the game, that doesn't mean that

18:20.195 --> 18:25.557
[SPEAKER_03]: They're violating the license agreement by doing that, right?

18:25.577 --> 18:30.018
[SPEAKER_02]: Or the gay sex ending for SimCopter What?

18:30.519 --> 18:34.180
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a gay sex ending for SimCopter How have I not heard of this?

18:34.540 --> 18:45.804
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a long time ago, I remember seeing something about this Well, SimCopter, the graphics weren't that great But it was a bunch of stick figures, guys, you know, having anal sex

18:46.408 --> 18:48.570
[SPEAKER_02]: And I kid you not, it was in the game.

18:48.650 --> 18:51.412
[SPEAKER_02]: It was an Easter egg that some developer hid in there.

18:51.432 --> 18:52.953
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, what the hell?

18:53.514 --> 18:54.455
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was in there.

18:54.655 --> 18:58.097
[SPEAKER_03]: In that context, the term Easter egg is like ten times funnier.

18:58.137 --> 18:58.478
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

18:59.018 --> 18:59.318
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

19:00.279 --> 19:00.680
[SPEAKER_03]: It's weird.

19:00.720 --> 19:00.920
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

19:01.200 --> 19:03.902
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, so quick poll.

19:04.022 --> 19:05.764
[SPEAKER_03]: Is anything going to happen to Rockstar because of this?

19:05.984 --> 19:06.364
[SPEAKER_03]: I say no.

19:07.665 --> 19:11.768
[SPEAKER_03]: The only thing that will happen is their game will sell more because people want to play it.

19:11.929 --> 19:14.791
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to play a game with simulated boobies.

19:15.510 --> 19:23.036
[SPEAKER_03]: As I also suggested on the live show earlier tonight, mirror the rating systems that the movies use.

19:23.137 --> 19:29.342
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it would be a good way for this rating system to become more socially acceptable because even though we as gamers know enough about this system,

19:30.259 --> 19:31.020
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think parents do.

19:31.040 --> 19:32.921
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop letting your kids play these games.

19:33.161 --> 19:34.262
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, it's just mature.

19:34.782 --> 19:38.524
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't sell it to minors, so you're buying it for them.

19:38.784 --> 19:39.745
[SPEAKER_02]: Shame on you.

19:40.205 --> 19:40.906
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are you coming?

19:41.186 --> 19:44.768
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know it was going to be full of blood and violence and stuff.

19:44.828 --> 19:46.869
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though on the back it says, full of blood and violence.

19:49.371 --> 19:50.992
[SPEAKER_03]: This is interesting.

19:51.492 --> 19:52.213
[SPEAKER_03]: Another story now.

19:52.233 --> 19:53.173
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to get into another story.

19:53.373 --> 19:59.317
[SPEAKER_03]: Xbox is going to be getting... You remember how Fable came out for the Xbox and then people were like, oh, it's good, but it's short.

19:59.693 --> 20:04.194
[SPEAKER_03]: So they released the version on the PC called The Lost Chapters, which is like a longer version of Fable.

20:04.434 --> 20:05.015
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, guess what?

20:05.275 --> 20:07.495
[SPEAKER_03]: Xbox is now getting Fable The Lost Chapters.

20:08.076 --> 20:10.276
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I read about this, I was like, damn it.

20:10.336 --> 20:12.557
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I just spent $30 on Fable not that long ago.

20:12.837 --> 20:13.257
[SPEAKER_03]: And get this.

20:13.557 --> 20:15.918
[SPEAKER_03]: Fable The Lost Chapters is going to be a budget title, $20.

20:16.898 --> 20:19.639
[SPEAKER_03]: So people like me who just recently bought the game are SOL.

20:20.459 --> 20:21.080
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

20:22.300 --> 20:22.680
[SPEAKER_03]: Jerks.

20:24.601 --> 20:26.981
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but that's good news for those folks that haven't played the game yet.

20:27.262 --> 20:28.722
[SPEAKER_03]: This will give them a good excuse to check it out.

20:29.875 --> 20:31.356
[SPEAKER_03]: How about we open up the old mailbag?

20:31.376 --> 20:34.877
[SPEAKER_03]: We got a lot of great letters from last week's show, so I think it's time we open up the mailbag.

20:34.897 --> 20:35.717
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys ready for this?

20:36.358 --> 20:36.578
[SPEAKER_03]: Ready.

20:36.898 --> 20:38.379
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's go into the mailbag.

20:42.420 --> 20:49.643
[SPEAKER_03]: First email came to us from Acer800, and Acer800 is a girl gamer and wanted to say this.

20:49.703 --> 20:53.325
[SPEAKER_03]: Your comments on girl gaming last week were pretty interesting and sadly true.

20:53.925 --> 20:55.726
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been playing games since I was a wee girl.

20:55.786 --> 20:58.267
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the first games I played was Mortal Kombat.

20:58.287 --> 20:58.467
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

20:59.485 --> 21:05.726
[SPEAKER_03]: I love fighting games and sport games and the feeling of how smug guys are shocked when I kick their butts at Soul Calibur 2.

21:06.755 --> 21:09.697
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, you're a great representation of a girl gamer.

21:09.717 --> 21:10.037
[SPEAKER_03]: You rock!

21:10.077 --> 21:10.798
[SPEAKER_03]: Aww, that warms my heart.

21:36.995 --> 21:40.336
[SPEAKER_03]: That's quite an achievement there to warm DarkSakura's cold little black heart.

21:40.576 --> 21:41.156
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just kidding.

21:42.557 --> 21:43.337
[SPEAKER_03]: I got shot a look.

21:43.757 --> 21:44.878
[SPEAKER_01]: My heart's not black.

21:45.458 --> 21:51.380
[SPEAKER_02]: Now all you need to do, DarkSakura, is you need to lick a PSP so you can become famous like that one chick who did nothing.

21:53.081 --> 21:53.461
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh?

21:54.041 --> 21:54.321
What?

21:55.041 --> 21:58.042
[SPEAKER_02]: The one that's on the red-ass baboon site or whatever.

21:58.082 --> 22:00.003
[SPEAKER_02]: The stupid girl gamer reviewer.

22:00.123 --> 22:00.463
[SPEAKER_03]: Forget it.

22:00.848 --> 22:04.952
[SPEAKER_02]: The one that's like a chauvinistic, or no, a feminist, yeah, I don't like her.

22:05.312 --> 22:10.137
[SPEAKER_03]: Look, the best thing I can say, I'm like, okay, whatever, you're on your own world there.

22:10.818 --> 22:15.442
[SPEAKER_03]: The best response I can give to that is, you go, girl.

22:16.083 --> 22:16.583
[SPEAKER_03]: You go, girl.

22:18.465 --> 22:18.625
What?

22:19.751 --> 22:20.672
[SPEAKER_01]: Ego++ I love the boys too

22:40.314 --> 22:45.157
[SPEAKER_03]: We had an email from Rob, sent us an email, and Rob had a comment on the women gaming issue as well.

22:45.617 --> 22:53.101
[SPEAKER_03]: One huge way to get girls and women to actually like video gaming would be to stop putting out girl games, quote unquote, that stink.

22:53.562 --> 22:59.785
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like a lot of girl games for preteens are created with entry level and inexperienced programmers to cut their teeth on.

23:00.306 --> 23:03.848
[SPEAKER_03]: This makes the preteens hate video games when they grow up, I imagine.

23:05.171 --> 23:06.793
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting perspectives.

23:07.153 --> 23:09.576
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop putting out such amateurish pink games.

23:09.616 --> 23:10.498
[SPEAKER_02]: I call them the pink games.

23:10.658 --> 23:11.999
[SPEAKER_02]: Or Mary-Kate and Ashley games.

23:12.019 --> 23:16.685
[SPEAKER_02]: Buena Vista Interactive needs to stop putting out titles for the Game Boy Advance.

23:17.005 --> 23:19.529
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, for example, Lizzie McGuire.

23:19.909 --> 23:21.010
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a Raven 3.

23:22.672 --> 23:24.455
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, and just like, you know...

23:25.724 --> 23:26.565
[SPEAKER_02]: Games like that.

23:26.585 --> 23:28.407
[SPEAKER_02]: They're platformers and just awful.

23:28.948 --> 23:29.429
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop.

23:29.629 --> 23:30.410
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what they need?

23:30.770 --> 23:34.154
[SPEAKER_02]: They need more puzzle games for the home consoles.

23:34.474 --> 23:35.395
[SPEAKER_02]: They need to hire me.

23:35.415 --> 23:35.656
[SPEAKER_01]: None.

23:39.966 --> 23:42.307
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to hire me to design games for them.

23:43.247 --> 23:47.608
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be chick with big gun shoots a bunch of idiots.

23:47.628 --> 23:48.968
[SPEAKER_01]: Wasn't that Tomb Raider?

23:49.508 --> 23:50.128
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no.

23:50.528 --> 23:52.689
[SPEAKER_03]: That's slut with big guns.

23:52.889 --> 23:53.409
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, sorry.

23:55.209 --> 23:57.010
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to spend too much more time on this topic.

23:57.170 --> 24:02.191
[SPEAKER_01]: The best thing about Tomb Raider was Tomb Raider 2 because you could do a little button press code and shit explode.

24:03.237 --> 24:04.678
[SPEAKER_01]: You could also go on her balcony.

24:04.698 --> 24:08.602
[SPEAKER_01]: You could shut the butler in the walk-in for a year and he wouldn't follow you anymore.

24:09.263 --> 24:11.245
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you could jump off the balcony and she'd break her neck.

24:11.705 --> 24:12.646
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do like a dive.

24:14.227 --> 24:14.407
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

24:14.848 --> 24:16.850
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why Tomb Raider 2 is the best of the series.

24:17.955 --> 24:21.917
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I think more girls would like Final Fantasy X if they gave it a chance, you know?

24:22.277 --> 24:23.478
[SPEAKER_03]: Final Fantasy X?

24:23.518 --> 24:24.878
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a game everybody can like.

24:24.978 --> 24:25.899
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, but think about it.

24:26.119 --> 24:27.840
[SPEAKER_03]: There are some... X-2.

24:27.920 --> 24:33.782
[SPEAKER_03]: Great... Well, X-2 is more like a girl power type game, but X... There's guys and girls who can agree.

24:33.823 --> 24:37.764
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the girls in that are great characters, and there's different types.

24:37.784 --> 24:42.967
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you have your kind of slutty Riku, but Yuna's a strong woman, and Lulu's kind of the sassy one.

24:43.007 --> 24:45.448
[SPEAKER_01]: Yuna is just determined, but she's a...

24:46.389 --> 24:48.213
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I'm self-spoken.

24:48.353 --> 24:51.499
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I'm going to be a summoner and die.

24:52.762 --> 24:55.728
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh wait, this sucks and my man is... I don't want to spoil it.

24:55.748 --> 24:56.830
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, alright, shh.

24:57.311 --> 24:57.732
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get...

24:58.120 --> 24:58.980
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get to another email.

24:59.000 --> 25:00.821
[SPEAKER_03]: This email came to us from Tom.

25:01.241 --> 25:02.841
[SPEAKER_03]: Tom W., thank you very much for the email.

25:03.961 --> 25:09.243
[SPEAKER_03]: Wants to let us know that we actually, last week we were talking about Bomberman and we said we couldn't think of one on the Genesis.

25:09.643 --> 25:14.424
[SPEAKER_03]: He wanted to let us know there actually was a Bomberman game on the Genesis, Mega Bomberman.

25:14.724 --> 25:16.224
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually have that somewhere.

25:16.424 --> 25:17.104
[SPEAKER_03]: And you forgot.

25:17.365 --> 25:19.565
[SPEAKER_01]: And I forgot because I have too damn many games.

25:19.605 --> 25:22.986
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, he also sent us a picture, so thank you very much for bringing back the memories there.

25:23.106 --> 25:24.826
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, Mega Bomberman was pretty cool.

25:24.846 --> 25:26.567
[SPEAKER_03]: We make mistakes, what can we say?

25:27.107 --> 25:27.487
[SPEAKER_01]: Except me.

25:28.226 --> 25:28.486
[SPEAKER_01]: R. Love PS3

25:44.750 --> 25:53.341
[SPEAKER_03]: He basically says in his email here, the reality is that this is a way for Sony to get more money from people by nickel and diming consumers on peripherals.

25:53.641 --> 25:55.443
[SPEAKER_03]: This is one thing I hate about Sony.

25:55.724 --> 26:02.192
[SPEAKER_03]: They put out a hard drive with Final Fantasy XI bundled because they knew someone would buy it with the assumption that there would be content that uses it.

26:03.396 --> 26:04.676
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't say I disagree.

26:04.716 --> 26:06.717
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the nickel and diming is one way to look at it.

26:06.937 --> 26:09.958
[SPEAKER_03]: Why bundle it in when we can get you to charge more?

26:09.998 --> 26:11.879
[SPEAKER_03]: But all the game companies are doing it.

26:11.979 --> 26:12.479
[SPEAKER_03]: Take GameCube.

26:12.499 --> 26:15.180
[SPEAKER_01]: Nintendo is the most notorious.

26:15.200 --> 26:15.540
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

26:15.580 --> 26:15.920
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo.

26:16.280 --> 26:17.401
[SPEAKER_03]: Take the Xbox.

26:17.461 --> 26:17.841
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.

26:17.921 --> 26:19.181
[SPEAKER_03]: The DVD playback kit.

26:19.321 --> 26:21.682
[SPEAKER_03]: If that wasn't nickel and diming you, I don't know what is.

26:21.942 --> 26:22.362
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?

26:22.382 --> 26:24.043
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to play DVDs, you cunts.

26:24.363 --> 26:29.825
[SPEAKER_01]: Even back on the Dreamcast, they put out this broadband adapter that two games used.

26:30.825 --> 26:32.746
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't even have it accessible on PSO.

26:33.832 --> 26:37.474
[SPEAKER_03]: So from my perspective, you have a point, but all the game companies are doing this.

26:37.534 --> 26:38.395
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not just Sony.

26:38.815 --> 26:44.319
[SPEAKER_03]: But the other part is that, that being said, a hard drive in PlayStation 3 would have been a bigger deal than it is.

26:44.719 --> 26:48.141
[SPEAKER_03]: That is because there would have been games and such that would support having it.

26:48.321 --> 26:54.806
[SPEAKER_03]: Xbox had that Blinks game, an in-game custom playlist on certain games which made a case, if not a small one, for having it.

26:55.126 --> 27:01.410
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love to believe that developers could dig up a bit more creativity if they realized more uses for an in-console hard drive.

27:01.550 --> 27:06.452
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know what rocked about the Xbox hard drive is modding it and putting games on it.

27:06.512 --> 27:07.052
[SPEAKER_03]: Woohoo!

27:07.132 --> 27:07.472
[SPEAKER_03]: Fun!

27:09.773 --> 27:14.275
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't disagree with what he's saying, though, because loading times could be reduced and things of that sort.

27:14.295 --> 27:15.455
[SPEAKER_03]: And he also talks about his email.

27:15.495 --> 27:16.595
[SPEAKER_03]: That's exactly why.

27:17.236 --> 27:19.697
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what my PlayStation 2 hard drive is for?

27:20.657 --> 27:21.557
[SPEAKER_01]: HD loader.

27:21.717 --> 27:25.078
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I use it for shortening those load times.

27:25.479 --> 27:28.420
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, of games that I have owned.

27:28.940 --> 27:29.300
[SPEAKER_01]: I have.

27:30.257 --> 27:31.298
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for the emails, you guys.

27:31.338 --> 27:32.479
[SPEAKER_03]: We always love your perspectives.

27:32.739 --> 27:34.621
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have a comment, you can always email that to us.

27:34.721 --> 27:37.823
[SPEAKER_03]: Tugo at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the address.

27:38.644 --> 27:40.405
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's look at some more gaming news going on.

27:40.525 --> 27:41.606
[SPEAKER_03]: Space Invaders.

27:41.966 --> 27:42.987
[SPEAKER_03]: You know Space Invaders.

27:43.047 --> 27:47.771
[SPEAKER_03]: According to the latest issue of Famitsu, Space Invaders is coming to the PSP.

27:48.691 --> 27:51.193
[SPEAKER_03]: And this will be released in Japan for $45.

27:52.374 --> 27:53.355
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can't help but think...

27:55.316 --> 27:57.197
[SPEAKER_03]: I can play it on my Atari for free.

27:57.717 --> 28:02.278
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a souped-up version of the classic, but from the screenshot I saw... With a trackball!

28:02.858 --> 28:04.759
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you've got that little analog thing, I guess.

28:05.179 --> 28:09.520
[SPEAKER_03]: From the screenshot I saw, it just looked like a souped-up version of the original, but nothing to scream about.

28:09.800 --> 28:12.061
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm thinking, $45 for Space Invaders?

28:12.081 --> 28:15.982
[SPEAKER_03]: Which, I'm sorry, in my opinion, Space Invaders is kind of one of those overrated classics.

28:16.522 --> 28:17.963
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, to me...

28:18.803 --> 28:21.644
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, give me a game like Galaxian, Jairus.

28:21.664 --> 28:23.906
[SPEAKER_01]: I think GORF for the same game was better.

28:23.926 --> 28:24.566
[SPEAKER_01]: GORF was awesome.

28:25.746 --> 28:27.667
[SPEAKER_03]: GORF was like three different games in one.

28:27.928 --> 28:29.809
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not all about the Space Invaders.

28:30.029 --> 28:31.629
[SPEAKER_03]: Pac-Man Warship, I get that.

28:31.890 --> 28:33.510
[SPEAKER_03]: Space Invader Warship, not so much.

28:33.770 --> 28:38.513
[SPEAKER_03]: But admittedly, and before someone sends an email on this, I understand it was a huge deal in Japan.

28:38.533 --> 28:40.274
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a much bigger deal there than it was here even.

28:41.178 --> 28:41.578
[SPEAKER_03]: I can see that.

28:41.598 --> 28:46.564
[SPEAKER_03]: And this game is only announced for Japan at this time, so maybe it makes a little more sense to that.

28:46.624 --> 28:46.884
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

28:46.924 --> 28:48.366
[SPEAKER_03]: But even the recent Pac-Man titles have all been budget.

28:48.386 --> 28:53.991
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the whole reason for cost, though, is, you know, it was the same reason why Nintendo 64 games were so expensive.

28:54.952 --> 28:58.216
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, uh, you know, they're, uh,

28:59.677 --> 29:00.558
[SPEAKER_01]: and more.

29:15.914 --> 29:16.354
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

29:16.655 --> 29:19.517
[SPEAKER_03]: Atari did this.

29:19.557 --> 29:21.519
[SPEAKER_03]: They updated a bunch of their old games.

29:21.579 --> 29:22.800
[SPEAKER_03]: Pong was one of them.

29:23.821 --> 29:24.702
[SPEAKER_03]: Did they do Warlords?

29:24.742 --> 29:25.682
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember.

29:25.742 --> 29:27.384
[SPEAKER_03]: Frogger came out in here as well.

29:28.124 --> 29:30.967
[SPEAKER_02]: How many Frogger games have there been?

29:31.427 --> 29:31.647
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms.

29:31.687 --> 29:32.208
[SPEAKER_03]: Pac-Man.

29:32.228 --> 29:35.130
[SPEAKER_03]: They redid a lot of old games.

29:35.871 --> 29:39.194
[SPEAKER_01]: I just remember a version of Warlords being in Lunar.

29:40.595 --> 29:41.296
[SPEAKER_01]: Lords of Lunar.

29:42.457 --> 29:43.718
[SPEAKER_01]: When they put it out on PS2.

29:45.197 --> 29:46.377
[SPEAKER_03]: This strikes me as those updates.

29:46.557 --> 29:49.098
[SPEAKER_03]: And I do remember the Pong one was actually pretty cool.

29:49.338 --> 29:52.418
[SPEAKER_03]: But the rest of them... You want to talk about update games that are good?

29:52.618 --> 29:52.818
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh.

29:53.398 --> 29:55.279
[SPEAKER_02]: New Sega Ages have been announced.

29:55.679 --> 29:56.159
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, really?

29:56.559 --> 29:56.859
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

29:57.259 --> 29:57.999
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are good ones.

29:59.119 --> 30:02.380
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, the one that I'm happiest about is Panzer Dragoon.

30:02.480 --> 30:07.061
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to remake the whole game and include the original on it.

30:07.301 --> 30:08.421
[SPEAKER_02]: It's coming to the PS2.

30:08.581 --> 30:09.741
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people... I have that.

30:10.041 --> 30:13.942
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people knocked the original classics that came out on PS2 saying it just...

30:14.822 --> 30:15.122
[SPEAKER_03]: and so on.

30:38.954 --> 30:41.635
[SPEAKER_02]: in order to give the game a perfect port for the first time.

30:41.655 --> 30:53.439
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see here, we've also got Gunstar Heroes Treasure Box, which is Gunstar Heroes, Dynamite Headdy, Alien Soldier, and it says three of the treasure's best known Mega Drive titles.

30:54.080 --> 30:55.320
[SPEAKER_01]: His treasure rocks.

30:55.540 --> 30:59.022
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and they also have Dynamite Deco, which was Die Hard in...

31:00.743 --> 31:02.104
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

31:23.015 --> 31:23.856
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

31:51.044 --> 31:54.147
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember kids, this is only to make backup copies of games you already own.

32:07.535 --> 32:07.996
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, okay.

32:08.356 --> 32:21.951
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the other thing that was announced is there's another group that's working on creating an external device to actually be able to run other types of memory cards.

32:21.971 --> 32:26.336
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, for example, USB flash drives, hard drives, and...

32:28.091 --> 32:32.595
[SPEAKER_02]: SD digital, SD cards and whatever, so basically other medias.

32:33.355 --> 32:40.981
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's another website, I believe WeAreBack is also them, with PSP development that they're going to make it so you can flash your PSP back to 1.5 or 1.0.

32:41.261 --> 32:41.501
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh boy.

32:44.230 --> 32:45.931
[SPEAKER_02]: The shit has hit the fan.

32:46.812 --> 32:49.974
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty much, this would be... It's game over.

32:50.214 --> 32:53.016
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be interested to see if Sony doesn't try to shut some of that stuff down.

32:53.036 --> 32:54.357
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

32:54.437 --> 32:56.459
[SPEAKER_02]: Once it's on the internet, though, it's hard to get off.

32:56.559 --> 32:57.139
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty hard.

32:57.720 --> 33:03.684
[SPEAKER_02]: Other interesting things, though, I should mention, the DS, they have Super Nintendo and Nintendo emulators for it now, finally.

33:04.524 --> 33:06.045
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, those are a little harder to come by.

33:06.065 --> 33:07.146
[SPEAKER_02]: A little harder to get on there, yeah.

33:07.166 --> 33:07.746
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.

33:08.807 --> 33:12.250
[SPEAKER_02]: They've actually started development on the PSP and the homebrew scene...

33:13.058 --> 33:13.339
[SPEAKER_02]: and so on.

33:30.444 --> 33:33.845
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, you know, it's kind of an audio program.

33:33.865 --> 33:35.546
[SPEAKER_02]: You can make your own mixes and stuff.

33:35.626 --> 33:37.887
[SPEAKER_02]: PSP Paints is out there, paint program.

33:38.547 --> 33:45.169
[SPEAKER_02]: And the best part also, and this isn't really hacking, is new colored PSPs are rumored to be coming out soon.

33:45.850 --> 33:47.810
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the colors that's rumored is hot pink.

33:48.230 --> 33:49.911
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, the actual, like, frames?

33:50.267 --> 33:51.707
[SPEAKER_03]: But not Sony endorsed.

33:52.068 --> 33:52.708
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it is Sony.

33:53.048 --> 33:53.148
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh!

33:54.108 --> 33:54.868
[SPEAKER_02]: In Japan, of course.

33:55.488 --> 33:57.069
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but the black one is so cool.

33:57.549 --> 33:59.730
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if they did a Sakura PSP, I'd have to have it.

34:00.510 --> 34:01.850
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd go for a nice dark green.

34:01.870 --> 34:03.571
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what's really going on right now.

34:03.591 --> 34:10.633
[SPEAKER_02]: If you'd want to play a good updated port of a game or whatever, the new Namco Battle Collection, all remade games.

34:10.693 --> 34:13.073
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got Rally-X, Dig Dug, and all that stuff.

34:13.433 --> 34:14.674
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one to check out over...

34:16.813 --> 34:20.618
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it the same updates that have been on GameCube previously?

34:20.658 --> 34:21.720
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't think so.

34:21.820 --> 34:22.581
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll have to check that out.

34:23.522 --> 34:28.329
[SPEAKER_03]: I have one quick little hacking and cracking story.

34:28.389 --> 34:29.490
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my god, you're into Slash.

34:30.748 --> 34:31.969
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, that was a Freudian slip.

34:32.009 --> 34:32.289
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

34:32.830 --> 34:34.651
[SPEAKER_03]: Quick hacking and cracking story.

34:34.691 --> 34:35.752
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this one's just cool.

34:36.512 --> 34:38.614
[SPEAKER_03]: This has to do with the program Stella.

34:38.694 --> 34:40.435
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an Atari 2600 emulator.

34:40.855 --> 34:49.021
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Fred Quimby, the guy who develops games for that emulator, he released a BASIC compiler that can be used to create games to run on Stella.

34:49.321 --> 34:53.324
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you think about it, using that same technology, you could actually make your own Atari 2600 games in BASIC.

34:55.253 --> 34:56.013
[SPEAKER_03]: I just think that's kind of cool.

34:56.033 --> 34:56.894
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how a lot of them are done.

34:57.014 --> 34:58.154
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why, I just think that's neat.

34:58.174 --> 34:59.195
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to know what else is cool?

34:59.275 --> 34:59.395
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

34:59.415 --> 35:04.777
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got an Amiga emulator on the PSP now, and you know what you can run on Amiga?

35:06.058 --> 35:06.818
[SPEAKER_02]: Monkey Island.

35:08.479 --> 35:14.422
[SPEAKER_03]: Stella, more information on that emulator, stella.sourceforge.net, and that's S-T-E-L-L-A.

35:14.522 --> 35:16.302
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, one last thing I forgot to mention.

35:16.482 --> 35:17.103
[SPEAKER_02]: GameMaker.

35:17.323 --> 35:18.623
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember the GameMaker programs?

35:18.643 --> 35:22.265
[SPEAKER_02]: They're on the PC, and they were on, you know, the PlayStation stuff, you can make your own games?

35:22.365 --> 35:22.885
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, sure.

35:22.965 --> 35:23.966
[SPEAKER_02]: One's coming to the DS.

35:25.006 --> 35:26.307
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a legit game?

35:26.587 --> 35:27.007
[SPEAKER_02]: Legit.

35:27.247 --> 35:27.567
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

35:27.868 --> 35:28.408
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's putting it out?

35:28.428 --> 35:28.768
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you remember?

35:29.268 --> 35:32.470
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe it's... Oh, God, I can't remember who the original company was.

35:33.491 --> 35:34.251
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the same company.

35:34.271 --> 35:34.471
[SPEAKER_02]: AgeTech.

35:34.531 --> 35:37.893
[SPEAKER_01]: AgeTech's doing RPG Maker 3.

35:37.933 --> 35:40.714
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to see RPG Maker 3 at their booth at E3.

35:40.734 --> 35:41.355
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let me see here.

35:41.475 --> 35:42.615
[SPEAKER_02]: It says right on it.

35:43.196 --> 35:45.517
[SPEAKER_02]: It is... How was it at E3?

35:46.417 --> 35:46.978
[SPEAKER_01]: It was pretty good.

35:47.018 --> 35:48.138
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't get to see a whole bunch of it.

35:49.179 --> 35:50.520
[SPEAKER_01]: They were more focusing on Front Mission.

35:51.140 --> 35:51.280
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

35:51.590 --> 35:53.711
[SPEAKER_02]: It does not say who's putting it out.

35:53.851 --> 35:54.751
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, isn't that a Square game?

35:55.071 --> 35:55.711
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not Front Mission.

35:57.592 --> 35:57.992
[SPEAKER_01]: The other one.

35:58.332 --> 36:06.294
[SPEAKER_02]: But apparently, I guess with this game maker, you can actually make games from a multiplayer game to 3D games.

36:06.575 --> 36:08.555
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is not just an RPG maker.

36:08.895 --> 36:10.516
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, White DS is coming out soon.

36:11.076 --> 36:11.456
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoop-de-doo.

36:12.438 --> 36:21.420
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, we here at Orange Launch Radio, we're not just about talking about video games all the time, because if we talked about video games all the time, we would have no time to go out and eat tacos.

36:22.180 --> 36:30.882
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are here to better your life, and what better way to better your life than DarkSakura giving you a little piece of her advice with her advice column.

36:31.342 --> 36:33.362
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, what are you going to talk to us about tonight?

36:35.343 --> 36:40.104
[SPEAKER_01]: Today's life lesson, bit of advice, call it what you will.

36:40.996 --> 36:42.777
[SPEAKER_01]: is how to perform a tracheotomy.

36:43.977 --> 36:46.498
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you never know when you have to give someone a tracheotomy.

36:47.898 --> 36:51.879
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one, find the person's Adam's apple thyroid, that's the thyroid cartilage.

36:52.600 --> 37:00.042
[SPEAKER_01]: Move your finger about one inch down the neck until you feel another bulge, the cricoid cartilage, I guess that's how it's pronounced.

37:00.102 --> 37:01.422
[SPEAKER_01]: It's C-R-I-C-O-I-D.

37:02.202 --> 37:09.265
[SPEAKER_01]: The indentation between the two is the cricothyroid membrane where the incision will be made.

37:11.155 --> 37:16.517
[SPEAKER_01]: Using a razor blade or knife, make a horizontal incision about half an inch across and half an inch deep.

37:17.377 --> 37:16.517
3.

37:17.937 --> 37:21.138
[SPEAKER_01]: Pinch the incision open or place your finger inside it to slit it open.

37:21.158 --> 37:21.138
4.

37:22.899 --> 37:26.380
[SPEAKER_01]: Insert a tube in the incision roughly and half inch to one inch deep.

37:27.340 --> 37:26.380
5.

37:27.780 --> 37:29.561
[SPEAKER_01]: Breathe into the tube with two quick breaths.

37:32.126 --> 37:38.030
[SPEAKER_01]: You will see the chest rise and the person should regain consciousness if you have performed the procedure correctly.

37:38.531 --> 37:41.333
[SPEAKER_01]: However, if you have performed it incorrectly, they will bleed to death.

37:43.894 --> 37:45.215
[SPEAKER_03]: Any final pieces of advice?

37:45.876 --> 37:50.419
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, just don't go hanging out on the smoking porch when people are about to choke to death.

37:51.279 --> 37:53.561
[SPEAKER_02]: Always check and see if there's a doctor nearby first.

37:54.061 --> 37:57.584
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I learned something because I once saw this on a TV show.

37:57.644 --> 37:59.385
[SPEAKER_03]: All they did was jam a big pen in there.

38:00.738 --> 38:01.198
[SPEAKER_03]: Big Pens.

38:01.578 --> 38:01.798
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

38:02.358 --> 38:03.259
[SPEAKER_03]: Emergency tracheotomy.

38:05.319 --> 38:09.000
[SPEAKER_01]: I was wondering though, a woman doesn't have an Adam's apple.

38:12.320 --> 38:19.182
[SPEAKER_01]: I did this try to feel, and see, I have this thing about my neck where if I touch my neck, if anything touches my neck, I get nauseous.

38:20.062 --> 38:25.663
[SPEAKER_01]: But I had to find, and I think I found the spot for a woman.

38:25.723 --> 38:28.084
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about maybe two-thirds down.

38:28.484 --> 38:29.064
[SPEAKER_03]: Eve's apple.

38:30.393 --> 38:34.356
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, anyway, this is kind of interesting.

38:36.177 --> 38:46.005
[SPEAKER_03]: Rumors going around the internet that Rare, which by the way is now like a Microsoft subsidiary, they're looking at developing Nintendo DS games, which makes a lot of people go, huh?

38:46.766 --> 38:56.173
[SPEAKER_03]: But sure enough, on their website, they're looking for experienced 3D artists for Nintendo DS and games programmers for the Nintendo DS.

38:57.387 --> 38:59.369
[SPEAKER_03]: And this just kind of makes us go, huh?

38:59.989 --> 39:01.730
[SPEAKER_03]: Is Microsoft going to do something with the DS?

39:01.770 --> 39:03.772
[SPEAKER_01]: Killer Instinct 3 on the DS!

39:05.513 --> 39:06.754
[SPEAKER_03]: That would make me happy, actually.

39:06.854 --> 39:14.099
[SPEAKER_03]: If Microsoft has no plans to enter the handheld market, I could see where this is just, hey, why not make money off someone else's console?

39:15.720 --> 39:18.562
[SPEAKER_03]: Assuming, again, that Microsoft has no plans to enter the market.

39:18.902 --> 39:22.805
[SPEAKER_03]: But of course, have you heard those rumors about the Xbox 360 is supposed to interact with the DS?

39:22.885 --> 39:23.305
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, what?

39:23.365 --> 39:23.666
[SPEAKER_01]: And PSP.

39:23.706 --> 39:23.926
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

39:25.201 --> 39:27.123
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, and all it is is a docking station.

39:28.384 --> 39:30.865
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to the Xbox 360 demo thing.

39:31.346 --> 39:40.012
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a docking station for the 360 that is basically any USB device or any type of device with transfer capability.

39:40.936 --> 39:45.037
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a docking station to connect to MP3 players like the iPod or the iRiver.

39:45.718 --> 39:58.202
[SPEAKER_01]: MP3, they have for mini disc players, for all kinds of variety, for digital cameras, scanners.

39:58.982 --> 40:06.865
[SPEAKER_01]: They basically are having a docking station to go with the 360 that's going to interface with basically any kind of digital media device.

40:07.817 --> 40:16.244
[SPEAKER_02]: What I heard was they're going to be using the Xbox 360 as basically you can use the PSP and the DS to play games over the internet.

40:16.324 --> 40:18.266
[SPEAKER_02]: Microsoft games over the internet.

40:18.306 --> 40:18.706
[SPEAKER_02]: Weird.

40:18.746 --> 40:24.411
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically what I'm thinking is it'll basically use those two devices as a Bluetooth controller.

40:25.772 --> 40:28.414
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't believe it until I see it, honestly.

40:28.494 --> 40:28.935
[SPEAKER_01]: I doubt it.

40:29.235 --> 40:29.495
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.

40:30.356 --> 40:36.501
[SPEAKER_01]: At the demo thing that I went to, they were doing, you know how they do little stylish outlines of different things and showing what?

40:36.820 --> 40:38.440
[SPEAKER_01]: They had a freaking outline of a PSP up there.

40:39.041 --> 40:39.741
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of weird.

40:39.941 --> 40:40.341
[SPEAKER_03]: That's weird.

40:41.041 --> 40:41.781
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well, we'll see.

40:43.742 --> 40:44.222
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on.

40:44.262 --> 40:49.884
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a story that's kind of been making that rounds on the web forums and being passed around via various emails.

40:49.924 --> 40:50.304
[SPEAKER_03]: Get this.

40:50.804 --> 40:58.986
[SPEAKER_03]: An 11-year-old boy stabbed his baby nephew in the stomach after the infant's crying disrupted his PlayStation game.

41:00.748 --> 41:05.272
[SPEAKER_03]: The PlayStation game in question had something to do with the Incredibles, basically, some type of port of the Incredibles.

41:06.173 --> 41:17.664
[SPEAKER_03]: And the boy told police that in the minutes before the incident, he kept losing while he was playing the game, and then the crying made him feel like an erupted volcano.

41:18.621 --> 41:20.802
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds like this kid's got anger management issues.

41:21.442 --> 41:22.342
[SPEAKER_03]: But what do you think?

41:22.363 --> 41:23.863
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll try to pin this on the game anyway.

41:23.963 --> 41:24.443
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think so.

41:24.563 --> 41:26.084
[SPEAKER_01]: No, because it's Disney.

41:26.384 --> 41:29.065
[SPEAKER_01]: Or was it Pixar?

41:29.205 --> 41:31.946
[SPEAKER_02]: If it were Grand Theft Auto, oh yeah.

41:32.527 --> 41:33.627
[SPEAKER_02]: Rockstar's getting a call.

41:34.187 --> 41:35.908
[SPEAKER_01]: And on top of that, this and this in the UK.

41:38.365 --> 41:43.528
[SPEAKER_03]: The news story I'm getting is from the UK, but I actually... No, I caught his slang.

41:44.369 --> 41:47.591
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to say, I thought it was actually in Florida or something.

41:47.631 --> 41:48.232
[SPEAKER_01]: In Florida?

41:48.472 --> 41:49.372
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a location listed?

41:49.973 --> 41:55.757
[SPEAKER_01]: No, because they went to the Diana Princess of Wales hospital.

41:57.078 --> 41:57.258
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

41:58.447 --> 41:59.507
[SPEAKER_03]: Which I don't think there's one in Florida.

41:59.708 --> 42:02.429
[SPEAKER_03]: Whole Crown Court, yeah, I guess it was in the UK.

42:02.569 --> 42:03.009
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

42:03.029 --> 42:04.970
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought this happened in the US.

42:05.010 --> 42:05.950
[SPEAKER_03]: It could have happened in the US.

42:05.970 --> 42:07.851
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that kind of reaction would happen there.

42:09.312 --> 42:12.333
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, honestly, Americans are a lot more freaking hysterical.

42:13.413 --> 42:17.195
[SPEAKER_03]: True, but you know somebody's going to try and pin this on the games.

42:18.319 --> 42:20.360
[SPEAKER_03]: because video games are evil.

42:21.341 --> 42:24.023
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that that's the same mindset there that it is here.

42:24.744 --> 42:28.647
[SPEAKER_01]: I would actually really love to hear from any of our UK listeners.

42:30.468 --> 42:38.554
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's any type of flashback, anything that's been in the news or anything, I would seriously like to know because I would love to compare the difference in reaction.

42:39.289 --> 42:40.990
[SPEAKER_01]: That would just amuse me to no end.

42:41.090 --> 42:44.753
[SPEAKER_03]: Togo, T-O-G-O, at OrangeLawnTrader.com if you want to send us one of those emails.

42:45.533 --> 42:46.834
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on, trying to wrap it up here.

42:47.254 --> 42:50.797
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful Joe was going to be called Beautiful Joe VFX Battle.

42:51.017 --> 42:53.738
[SPEAKER_03]: They're changing the name to Beautiful Joe Battle Carnival.

42:54.759 --> 42:57.341
[SPEAKER_03]: GameCube game coming out September 29th.

42:57.741 --> 42:59.862
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes me think too much of Carnival.

43:00.663 --> 43:01.203
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

43:01.283 --> 43:02.904
[SPEAKER_03]: Battle Carnival is a little interesting.

43:02.924 --> 43:03.665
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a cool name, though.

43:03.985 --> 43:04.325
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

43:05.146 --> 43:05.406
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

43:06.671 --> 43:09.853
[SPEAKER_03]: And last but not least tonight, the guy game.

43:09.973 --> 43:10.794
[SPEAKER_03]: You remember this game?

43:10.874 --> 43:16.037
[SPEAKER_03]: They got a little bit busted early on because one of the chicks in it was not 18.

43:17.958 --> 43:24.843
[SPEAKER_03]: The guy game was banned, which I was surprised to see that the story had kind of hit...

43:26.643 --> 43:29.927
[SPEAKER_03]: This week, because I thought the thing got banned months ago when this first came out.

43:30.007 --> 43:32.609
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the PC version came out and it was on shelves.

43:32.769 --> 43:38.235
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically what it is, is that the temporary holding that was on the game became permanent.

43:38.755 --> 43:42.379
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Guy Games website does confirm this.

43:42.987 --> 43:43.528
[SPEAKER_03]: Just so you know.

43:44.028 --> 43:47.491
[SPEAKER_01]: If you get a copy, wait a couple weeks, slap that mother on eBay.

43:47.872 --> 43:48.632
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, here's the thing.

43:49.133 --> 43:54.718
[SPEAKER_03]: Now what they're going to do is they're going to put it all on a DVD called The Guy Game, Game Over, and sell it for $19.99.

43:56.760 --> 43:59.803
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably, I would guess, without the 17-year-old in question.

43:59.883 --> 44:02.445
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll just trim her on out of there and have a new DVD.

44:04.727 --> 44:05.367
[SPEAKER_03]: So there you have it.

44:05.447 --> 44:07.889
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, interested in that purchase at all?

44:07.929 --> 44:08.909
[SPEAKER_02]: I already have the guy game.

44:10.090 --> 44:18.894
[SPEAKER_02]: What's interesting though is that actually Girls Gone Wild is doing this new thing called Girls Gone Wild games.

44:19.874 --> 44:20.835
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's actually...

44:21.326 --> 44:25.447
[SPEAKER_02]: The little mini... Not really the mini games, but if you... Rob played the guy game.

44:25.707 --> 44:29.328
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember at the very end of the guy game, they had the guy game challenge or whatever?

44:30.088 --> 44:34.289
[SPEAKER_02]: And where the women would do, like, they'd bounce on the ball or they would jump.

44:34.469 --> 44:35.469
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all that.

44:35.990 --> 44:39.410
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and they got, like, a minute bonus if they did it topless and things like that?

44:39.430 --> 44:39.911
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.

44:39.931 --> 44:40.951
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all that crap.

44:41.911 --> 44:43.691
[SPEAKER_02]: So, apparently, this will be popular.

44:44.432 --> 44:48.773
[SPEAKER_02]: How much you wanna bet that, you know, that Girls Gone Wild will put out a trivia game just like this?

44:49.353 --> 44:49.813
[SPEAKER_02]: One of these days.

44:51.112 --> 44:52.233
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gonna happen.

44:52.273 --> 44:52.994
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gonna happen.

44:53.834 --> 44:57.297
[SPEAKER_02]: And honestly, I think the guy game, they should do another one.

44:58.097 --> 45:01.080
[SPEAKER_02]: ID him first.

45:01.300 --> 45:01.880
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

45:02.861 --> 45:05.843
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, that's gonna do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio To Go.

45:06.184 --> 45:07.204
[SPEAKER_03]: Final thoughts, Loki?

45:07.885 --> 45:11.168
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna play me some Killer7 and hopefully finish this game.

45:12.629 --> 45:16.892
[SPEAKER_03]: My final thought is rubbing together, oil, Dark Sakura.

45:17.312 --> 45:19.354
[SPEAKER_01]: We need the girl game with like

45:20.454 --> 45:23.596
[SPEAKER_01]: and then the special Yaoi edition.

45:26.497 --> 45:27.077
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead.

45:27.277 --> 45:27.957
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you first.

45:28.218 --> 45:31.419
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say, by the way, there's a new Guys Gone Wild DVD coming out.

45:32.299 --> 45:32.780
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay!

45:35.461 --> 45:39.362
[SPEAKER_01]: But my absolute final thought is reject bus icons!

45:41.003 --> 45:41.683
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to do it.

45:41.703 --> 45:42.764
