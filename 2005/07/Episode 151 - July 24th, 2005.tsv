148615	149836	I have not even looked at this.
149856	155421	Well, I saw it when it was on TV, but I have not looked at the digitized format of it, so we're going to check that out very soon.

303865	312892	We're plugged in and fully interactive through our website at www.orangeloungeradio.com My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.
313332	315594	Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts.
316094	322038	In this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm, Miss Jamie Summers, also known as DarkSakura.
325641	326602	Actually, she's not here.
326702	328783	She's running a little late tonight.
328824	330805	She had some family business she had to take care of.
331229	335351	Hopefully everything's okay, but she's going to be here a little bit later on, just so you know.
336112	338974	However, we do have the one and only Loki.
339754	340254	I am here.
341175	342916	And not in the cushion of the seat.
343016	345938	That was very good timing, by the way, finding your microphone.
346078	349060	Well, Jamie should be sitting on both of the microphones then.
350380	350741	I'm not sure.
351001	352962	It probably got put there during the party last night.
352982	354623	We had a little bit of a house party last night.
354963	357264	Maybe I shouldn't be talking with this microphone against my mouth.
358885	359986	Is that the loud, sensitive one?
361908	362548	I don't know, who knows?
362688	362888	No?
363089	363329	Anyway.
363909	367752	Alright, so Loki's here, and then special guest-wise, we have nobody.
368553	370034	I don't know, what the hell happened?
370074	372416	We used to have special guests here every single week.
372456	375579	There'd be somebody here, and lately, nobody loves us anymore.
375619	376980	Is it because we're in this new place?
377500	378001	I don't get it.
379102	379782	Something's weird.
379882	381243	Can they give him bad directions?
381624	382204	I guess so.
382304	384766	It's like I lied to him about where I live or something.
384826	385207	I don't know.
386468	386808	Oh well.
387455	388475	Fine, see if we care.
388515	390276	We'll just sit here and do the show ourselves.
390596	392337	So we have some fun stuff to talk about tonight.
393377	395518	We were famous this week.
396058	397378	Well, you know, we're always famous.
397458	402660	But no, we were on local news this week, so we have to show that clip later in the show.
403020	405601	Which makes for great radio, by the way, showing video clips.
405961	407862	But even the audio of it is going to be pretty funny.
408822	410843	Loki's bit in it is priceless.
411503	411823	Love it.
412608	418169	So we'll be airing that for you guys, and telling you guys how you can get a copy of the video, because some of you guys are asking about that.
418189	421910	Just like Publish Media, too, you'll get the best of me.
423090	425330	Yes, last time when we were in the paper, it was your foot.
426990	428531	More of my foot in this one, too.
428951	430691	They actually, well, we'll get to that later.
430711	431771	Yeah, we'll get to that a little later.
432531	434492	Also, we gotta talk about our buddy MidiHead.
434872	436952	He's been doing some fun stuff this week.
438072	440653	And we'll play a little clip of his new Ultramix 3 song, too.
440913	442013	I don't want to play the whole thing...
442540	443281	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
487524	488552	Thank you for watching!
557529	559330	Mr. Night, you make me cry, I need your love
590188	594472	Listen to the song, the melody will set you free.
594552	596413	You need my love, it's in your mind.
596493	598715	I need you, I love you, I can't sleep with you.
598835	600517	You gotta save your life.
600537	601758	The night makes me cry.
601818	603519	I need your love, it's in my mind.
603639	606401	I need you, I love you, I can't sleep with you.
606461	607222	Listen to the song.
616440	617521	Thank you for watching.
617541	618622	Please subscribe to my channel.
680381	681249	Thanks for watching!
808032	812815	From Step Squad to Orange Lounge, this PDR sucks!
813215	824522	Holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.
824762	827323	I think I threw up in my mouth a little bit during that last break.
829024	829265	Okay.
829985	832106	We had some vomit-inducing songs.
832486	835568	Admit it, there's at least one song you hated in that last break.
836389	836669	I think
837199	841402	I think during that break we'd have people in the chatroom be like, Oh, I love that song!
841422	843463	And then there'd be other people going, God, I hate that song.
843483	845565	And then during the next song, it would switch around.
846365	848447	Cartoon Heroes by Barbie Young.
849447	851188	Speed Over Beethoven by Rose.
851429	855431	Nori Nori Nori, Judy Crystal, and Living in America from DDR Max 2.
855972	858253	And I don't remember the artist on that because I'm too lazy to look it up.
858833	860595	And I never play that song, so I don't remember.
861996	862216	Oh well.
863396	863657	Anyway.
864998	866338	So we're here with another show.
866599	866959	Oh, hello!
868186	869327	Here's the lovely DarkSakura.
869367	869807	She's here.
871027	875990	And we were about ready to chat about what's going on in the Bomani world.
876090	879872	Actually, before that, though, we always have to start off each week's show with a little bit of, How was your week?
880352	881072	How was your day?
881693	883213	And DarkSakura just joined us.
883353	888116	She usually starts us off, so... I'd rather not talk about my week, thanks.
888976	889236	Okay.
889596	890997	Well, then we'll move on to Loki.
891818	893118	My week was hot.
894599	895019	That's hot.
895719	896620	No, it's because...
897575	899956	The air conditioning is broken for a week, so that sucked.
899996	903838	But I have a house with a dog, my mom's dog, and that sucked also.
904859	907440	And, um, what else?
907620	909161	Oh, just a lot of sucking.
909622	915625	Basically, you know, staying at my mom's house sucked because she is on dial-up and no one likes dial-up.
915745	923809	And also the fact that the dog, you know, wants constant attention all the time, including at 3 in the morning, and it's just, you know, very tiring.
923949	925190	And then I finally get home...
925523	927464	You know, on Friday, you know, okay, I'm done.
927524	932326	Finally, you know, the apartment complex has had a week to fix their, you know, AC.
932466	934047	Nope, nope, nope, they're not done yet.
934647	936068	They're not going to be done until Monday.
936788	939690	So, all weekend, it's been like 95 degrees in the apartment.
939750	941811	What are they having to do for your AC?
941891	948774	They replaced the whole thing, the whole entire unit, and then they said they clogged something, so they've got to do something on... Jesus.
948954	950935	And I'm like, oh, God, you're fucking retarded.
950975	951575	You know what?
951856	954817	Your situation is starting to sound like the plot of Dark Water.
957168	958449	I think it's about more than a mold spot.
958469	962470	It is, but that's where they try to get the scares wrong.
986465	994851	with mold, you know, cause that killer mold, the black mold, it's always gotta be the black mold, you know, what do they got against the black mold?
998133	1016245	So yeah, basically, um, it sucked a lot, and then, um, I don't know, then the rest of the week was just basically, um, you know, work stuff, playing PSP, played more Killer7, and that type of thing.
1017864	1018024	Yeah.
1019245	1019585	That's it.
1021426	1023548	My week and my day was okay.
1023928	1025149	Nothing to scream about, really.
1025529	1029832	It's been very hot here in the city, so it makes you not want to go out and do a lot.
1032375	1035276	I went and saw Charlie and the Chocolate Factory for the second time.
1035316	1035977	That was pretty cool.
1036877	1037717	Because that movie rocks.
1038338	1041099	And I went to this restaurant called the Cheesecake Factory.
1041659	1043020	And this is for my roommate's birthday.
1044580	1046741	And this place is very, very expensive.
1046781	1049643	And it's kind of known around town for having a very, very long wait.
1050123	1052904	I can't remember if this place is a national chain or if it's something on the west coast.
1052924	1053524	I know they have more.
1053544	1054705	Is it national?
1054745	1057346	Okay, then they've got one of these probably near you somewhere.
1057666	1058387	I've never been before.
1058427	1060047	It's brand new in this part of town.
1060067	1061208	They have crappy pizza there.
1061727	1065209	I've never had the pizza, but the food in general... You had good orange chicken.
1065990	1082460	I actually had the orange chicken, and to be honest, I wasn't a fan of the orange chicken because I felt like I was paying $14 for the orange chicken here, and I could pay like $6 over at the little Mon Pod Chinese restaurant, and the orange chicken was just as good, if not better.
1082821	1087684	So it was one of those things where like, okay, well, you're paying for atmosphere, but the host that we had was kind of a doof.
1090595	1090956	I don't know.
1092396	1095478	Luckily, the cheesecake itself was really, really good.
1095558	1099580	So at least, if you're going to call your restaurant the Cheesecake Factory, you should have good cheesecake.
1100020	1100720	And that they did.
1100880	1104602	So I forgive them for at least having subpar rest of their food.
1105002	1111025	But still, the bill being quite a large amount of money for three people, I expected more.
1111125	1111405	I don't know.
1111445	1114287	I wanted showgirls dancing or something.
1114327	1115668	I expected more.
1116228	1118689	Our waitress at the San Francisco restaurant juggled
1119213	1119973	Ketchup Packets.
1120533	1121494	So she earned her tip.
1122474	1122934	Where was this at?
1122994	1124914	The San Diego one is really the best one I've been to.
1125174	1126175	It's in San Francisco.
1126255	1128155	It's the top of Macy's.
1129915	1132136	It's on the 13th floor or something like that.
1132156	1132496	Awesome.
1133096	1138657	And basically you can go walk over and look at the balcony and stuff on top of the roof there.
1139417	1144758	They had some stupid Christian thing going on after the gay pride parade.
1145979	1147019	They equal everything out.
1148956	1150457	DarkSakura.com
1178755	1179355	Us, of course.
1179435	1180436	Okay, you want to talk about us?
1180776	1182436	So we were on the news this week.
1184057	1186077	They came out to do a story.
1186177	1186818	When were they out here?
1186878	1187178	Monday?
1187378	1187738	Yeah.
1188018	1188978	They were out here Monday.
1190119	1197901	Actually, they were out here originally on Friday, or they were supposed to be out here originally on Friday, but real news happened somewhere, so we got bumped to Monday.
1198281	1200822	But they were out here, and the reporter guy was very, very nice.
1201543	1201683	And...
1203917	1204477	The Cameraman.
1204497	1205898	They actually stayed quite a while.
1205958	1208118	They were probably here for about an hour just filming different things.
1208459	1216101	They filmed interviews with all three of us, and then they filmed us playing DDR on my new TV, which was pretty cool.
1217122	1218682	Always a bad sign.
1219222	1223544	Yeah, I got a note here that says I got to take a picture of you guys playing DDR.
1223944	1225024	What does that have to do with our show?
1227065	1227345	Nothing.
1228225	1229886	But yeah, I'm supposed to do that.
1231235	1236226	always a bad sign you're just bitter because your feet always somehow end up in it somehow
1239194	1240675	We did our research a lot.
1241295	1243116	You guys play during the show, don't you?
1243416	1243856	Don't you?
1244136	1244616	Don't you?
1244876	1245277	Don't you?
1245717	1246657	No, you idiot.
1246757	1247337	We do not.
1247377	1248078	We have.
1248418	1249658	We did like twice.
1249898	1253820	We did the Xbox Live tournament online, which nobody showed up for.
1254260	1260442	Remember we were going to have our big gala 16 person DDR online tournament and then like four people showed up.
1260842	1262263	I don't remember anything about that.
1262941	1264622	It must have been a week you weren't here or something.
1264642	1265482	It was.
1266522	1267243	You remember this, right?
1267303	1268363	It was an impromptu.
1269243	1272705	It was when we were unveiling Ultramix 2 or something like that.
1273225	1273785	That's what it was.
1273825	1275266	It was one of those unveiling shows.
1275286	1281388	And we tried to get all these people to come and only four people showed up, which shows you how many people listen to this program.
1284524	1287586	I mean, I mean, people are on Xbox Live and we'll see, whatever.
1287926	1290428	And have Ultramix too, I don't know, I guess not that many, but we'll see.
1290828	1298192	So we tried to do that and it failed miserably, but we have done the play DDR thing on the show before, it's just not the focus about our show.
1298552	1307257	I guess, you know, and we do talk about DDR, we talk about 2DX on the show, so I see where they get that impression, but the playing DDR on the show was a little crazy.
1307337	1309358	Apparently, we talk about it on the podcast too.
1310239	1310619	Yeah, so...
1311018	1312239	DarkSakura, you haven't seen this yet, right?
1339898	1345181	DarkSakura is going to get to see this for the very first time, so here we go.
1345422	1346642	I don't want anybody to see me though.
1347543	1347923	Too late.
1348143	1348583	Too late?
1348603	1349404	You were on the news!
1351305	1352205	Too damn late!
1352446	1355788	I needed to ask to be pixelated and have them spell my name right!
1355868	1359670	Maybe I should have been the spokesperson because that's the only way I'm going to get on air.
1360770	1365913	When you see what they did to Loki, Extifer, my roommate and I, laughed until we peed.
1366033	1366754	It was so funny.
1367594	1368315	Alright, here we go.
1368988	1371810	Fuck.
1371830	1375473	The governor is one of the many people joining the podcasting craze.
1375553	1378235	It's becoming a web craze, but what is it?
1378375	1378935	How does it work?
1379015	1386581	KCRA 3's Brian Hickey tonight shows us how people are using podcasting to inform, entertain, and share their thoughts with the world.
1387236	1390197	By the way, this report comes from a local news station, Channel 3.
1390997	1393197	And the reporter was very nice.
1393657	1394457	He was a very nice man.
1394517	1395238	I liked him.
1395398	1395798	He was good.
1395838	1401739	And he had done his research because I was very impressed with what he did know about the station before he came here.
1401779	1405600	Of course, I know he'd been talking to you quite a bit, so you probably filled him in on all that.
1405620	1405960	Of course!
1407120	1410601	When he headed off to the editors, all hell breaks loose.
1410761	1411561	Hold on, hold on.
1415720	1422142	and there's Jamie playing DDR.
1422802	1424862	It started off tiny and it's grown.
1429343	1431384	It started off tiny and it's grown.
1434405	1439806	If I didn't know you were talking about a podcast there, I could sell that clip for some blackmail.
1439826	1440226	And there's us.
1445733	1449965	I would like to point out that they may not realize it, but look what they're showing in the background.
1450839	1451740	Did they blur that out?
1451820	1452280	I can't tell.
1452580	1453461	It's too far away.
1453501	1457884	Yeah, there's the Jay and Silent Bob poster, which hangs here in the studio.
1457924	1462147	We have a Jay and Silent Bob poster, and I quote, All you motherfuckers are gonna pay.
1462247	1463829	You are the ones who are the ball lickers.
1463869	1466991	We're gonna fuck your mothers while you watch and cry like little whiny bitches.
1467431	1476218	Once we get to Hollywood and find those Miramax fucks who's making the movie, we're gonna make them eat our shit, then shit out our shit, then eat their shit, which is made up of our shit that we made them eat.
1476818	1478399	And then all you motherfuckers are next.
1478459	1479220	Love, Jay and Silent Bob.
1480726	1483689	You can actually see that poster in the background a little bit.
1484630	1485571	And we digress a bit.
1485611	1486692	Let's go ahead and keep going.
1486752	1487013	Sorry.
1487633	1488374	I don't look hideous.
1488715	1493740	Look, if we could get the word fuck on the news in any way, shape, or form, I think that's worth a comment.
1494501	1495201	We've done our job.
1496082	1496703	All right, here we go.
1496943	1500587	We should report ourselves to the MPA.
1500647	1501428	Let me roll it back a little.
1501448	1503170	Yeah, we're going to have to re-rate our show adults only.
1503210	1503430	Hold on.
1504286	1506048	A subculture of pop culture.
1506388	1509731	And these are the voices to unite and inform the gaming fans.
1510112	1512594	And where am I?
1512995	1516738	Okay, stop, stop.
1517219	1519321	I would like to note, where am I?
1519701	1520682	Oh, there are my feet!
1520782	1521543	But where am I?
1521603	1523906	Oh, that's right, they cut me behind the goddamn door.
1525100	1527581	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1551411	1558218	and you can see me doing the chatting and then you see Loki's feet dangling and his belly kind of hanging out from behind the corner
1559170	1560290	I look so short.
1560530	1561791	My feet don't touch the ground.
1562211	1566372	And when they say, you're right, your feet are dangling.
1566392	1567132	Look, look at my feet.
1567212	1568773	You look like you're sitting in Santa's lap.
1571513	1571753	No.
1571974	1574554	But when they go, these are the faces of Orange Lounge Radio.
1574594	1578615	They show Jamie, they show me, and then they cut to another picture.
1581176	1583697	Yeah, because I have a face for radio, apparently.
1584298	1587499	And those of you guys that are complaining that you can't see this, you will eventually.
1587559	1592722	We're working on, it's just a bandwidth thing right now, but we're going to get it uploaded sometime tonight.
1592762	1594762	So you guys will have it by tomorrow.
1595003	1596363	But anyway, here we go.
1596423	1598164	Let me finish the story here.
1599004	1602286	Welcome to another episode of our podcast.
1602666	1608529	From their apartment in Rancho Cordova, using revolutionary technology, they're podcasting to the world.
1609391	1611774	And apparently we all live in the same apartment.
1611794	1613315	I look horrible.
1613775	1615457	I look horrible.
1615557	1616958	I have you freeze-framed right now.
1616978	1618620	I look like I'm about to puke.
1618660	1621122	The way you see my picture, it's even better.
1621262	1621823	Hold on, hold on.
1621863	1625466	Let me roll this back slightly so we can hear what Jamie has to say about podcasting.
1626307	1631051	We basically give the news for video games, popular culture...
1631784	1634229	Basically what gamers really want to know.
1634289	1637595	Okay, so they spelled Jamie's name right on the text over at least.
1637675	1640020	They didn't spell it right online, but they spelled it right on the text over.
1641159	1646823	...podcast producers record their programs, then send them to a number of websites now hosting the shows.
1647323	1650585	Now anyone can create, edit, and... Ooh, David shot at me.
1650885	1654007	Yeah, but no pictures of me.
1654047	1658349	Lots of pictures of Rob, lots of pictures of Jamie, but no Matt.
1658369	1661011	Hold on, I didn't hear what Jamie said there.
1661031	1661691	I've got to roll it back.
1661851	1664293	...to anyone else willing to download it.
1664513	1665754	It's something they can take with them.
1666134	1669396	It's a much more flexible way of spreading the information.
1669898	1674663	With nothing more than an MP3 player and a set of headphones, you can listen to it anywhere.
1675424	1678367	Now people can talk about things they like to talk about.
1678848	1680469	Yeah, who's this random guy?
1680770	1684053	Now they're interviewing random guy on the skateboard.
1684394	1685575	Like some dude they found.
1685595	1686276	Where's the name?
1686316	1687157	Casey Ryle.
1687177	1687337	Yes.
1687717	1707601	If you listen to our show, email us If Casey listens to the show, the more power to him I'm glad one of our listeners got to be a media whore But I'd also like to point out, Casey only owns an iPod Shuffle So he's not even that hardcore Anyway Again, if I didn't know he was talking about podcasting, I'd find that pretty amusing
1718876	1719437	What grade am I in?
1719457	1719717	Keep playing.
1719737	1721018	Let me get the reporter here.
1721098	1723059	I would like to point out that that is the only time in the entire
1743187	1749652	or in the entire news clip that our actual show name is put somewhere because they never say Orange Lounge Radio.
1749973	1754476	But when they're showing how to get to the podcast and stuff, that's when they bring up the Orange Lounge Radio.
1754536	1759660	It's like they show the person searching for Orange Lounge Radio and it comes up in our little entry into iTunes stores.
1759680	1760661	Oh, you know, that's nice.
1763263	1763683	Good for them.
1763723	1765084	I'm glad they plugged the show.
1765645	1767406	Like maybe the SACB did.
1767426	1769728	At least they put our damn URL in there.
1769868	1772050	Extifer, do you still think the reporter was cute?
1774184	1776406	I did think the reporter was cute, actually.
1776766	1778608	I still, I hold to that.
1778888	1779269	Anyway.
1782271	1782732	Anyway.
1798118	1799882	That lot could be some podcasts.
1799922	1801124	Did you see?
1801465	1805693	First of all, they have Loki sitting in DarkSakura's chair, but oh, it's so much fun.
1806713	1807554	Oh, God, you guys.
1808254	1811236	I didn't even have my goddamn name on there.
1811617	1812797	Where's my name on there?
1813218	1815019	Oh, God, you guys, that's so much fun.
1815840	1816960	Oh, it's so much fun.
1816980	1818061	What's so much fun?
1818361	1819282	What am I talking about?
1819802	1822204	Oh, Kelly people, it's so much fun.
1822785	1825867	Oh, you know, Klostomy, that's so much fun.
1826107	1827688	I mean, what the hell am I talking about?
1827708	1828749	They don't say anything.
1828809	1829629	It's just retarded.
1829930	1832391	I said a whole lot more than just, oh, it's so much fun.
1832712	1833432	Oh, it's so much fun.
1833752	1834393	Oh, it's so much fun.
1837020	1837520	Oh, look at that!
1837761	1839502	I look like a goddamn chipmunk!
1839742	1841884	My head looks like it has exploded!
1844305	1846487	So, I'm super fat!
1846567	1847388	Look at me!
1847548	1851511	It's so much fun being a... Did you think that maybe you are super fat?
1852351	1853272	No, I am not!
1853472	1854153	I'm not like that!
1854173	1856654	I'm just having a momentary mental image of Krim.
1859396	1863019	Me and that shit, we go... It was a night out.
1866480	1866960	Wait, let me see.
1867501	1868561	Let me see.
1869161	1872203	Let me see if I can.
1872743	1874224	Wait, let me see if I can.
1875124	1876065	Let me see if I can.
1876945	1878006	Let me see if I can cue this up.
1878046	1880147	That should be in the next intro.
1880387	1880727	Hold on.
1881467	1881708	Okay.
1882328	1885049	Hey, Loki, what do you think about gay sex?
1885369	1886370	Oh, it's so much fun.
1897270	1899250	Don't worry, this will be continued later in FG's.
1899631	1900911	I have not forgot about them.
1903131	1904372	Let's let this finish up here.
1904492	1905912	Speech for everyone.
1906292	1907252	Oh, it's so much fun.
1907512	1913934	It's great that, you know, just anybody out there who really has a desire to want to be heard, you have an outlet for your voice to get out there.
1913954	1915954	God damn, I can't believe I let people watch this.
1916454	1918795	In Rancho Cordova, Brian Hickey, KCRA 3 reports.
1920359	1921740	See, everybody's a broadcaster now.
1921780	1924460	Recently, Governor Schwarzenegger began... Oh, good for the governor!
1924500	1926601	He gets a fucking plug, but do we know?
1926621	1928522	What the fuck is up with him?
1928702	1933344	So you can listen to it in the car, in the walk, or even in the gym.
1936305	1939606	Yeah, I'm sure his podcast is very easy to listen to.
1940226	1944808	When you understand half the words... We're going to slash the budget now!
1946684	1948529	Thank you for downloading my podcast!
1951918	1952681	It's so much fun.
1954821	1956941	Oh, it's... I love my podcast!
1957182	1958222	It's so much fun!
1958562	1960222	It's tiny, but it's good!
1960242	1966664	All of you that own iPod shuffles, the iPod shuffles are the girly mans of iPods!
1967344	1977106	Okay, so not only did they not plug our show, not even mention who our show was, not even put me on there, gave me some really crappy line, one I had a whole lot more to say, you know?
1977686	1978006	What's that?
1978427	1980689	Okay, so basically we're going to ask you a lot of questions.
1980709	1987195	We're going to get you saying something really stupid, cut to you for about a second, because we know we have to, and then we're done.
1988896	1989397	What the hell?
1991239	1991839	What's up with that?
1992119	1994121	It's like the pictures of podcasting.
1994221	1995202	Oh, oh, we forgot one.
1996924	1998085	I had a cleavage shot.
1998205	1999366	It's like, gee.
1999406	1999726	Okay.
2001571	2006937	Orange Lounge Radio has more name recognition than Arnold Schwarzenegger.
2020680	2021620	Well, someday we will.
2022381	2024742	Well, we can if people don't fucking plug our show.
2025142	2025622	Hello?
2025962	2026583	I mean, come on.
2026663	2027843	How long is it going to take?
2028304	2029844	Take the extra two seconds.
2030424	2031505	You can find this podcast here.
2031565	2031785	Boop.
2031885	2033646	Okay, put the URL up there.
2033926	2034246	Done.
2034526	2039729	I mean, or just say, you know, just like this show out of Sacramento, Orange Launch Radio.
2039909	2041309	Just mention the name once.
2042290	2043631	Once is all we're asking.
2043751	2044711	Show the website.
2044751	2045431	Show something.
2045451	2048833	Do you think that maybe we don't get our name on TV because here we are just...
2050260	2051881	Fuck them!
2052161	2052982	Sack beat all the way!
2053022	2055803	I don't give a shit if my goddamn foot was in there and that was it.
2056083	2057664	At least they fucking mentioned our show.
2057704	2060245	The hell with them, because they made me look like a fucking idiot.
2063107	2064547	That's what I have to say about that.
2066848	2068209	I don't give a crap, okay?
2068369	2074032	I honestly don't give a... If they showed me at least saying something intelligent, like, podcasting, you know, we've, you know...
2074414	2076275	So, Loki, what do you think of your anger management courses?
2076295	2076916	Oh, it's so much fun.
2106115	2107555	I know what this is going to turn into.
2108476	2110636	It's going to be just like the other goddamn thing.
2110856	2113597	Oh, oh, I shot my foot.
2113617	2115698	Loki, you're purple in the face.
2116898	2117918	I'm not purple in the face.
2118878	2119379	I'm angry.
2120279	2121519	Can you see your face?
2122059	2122780	You are purple.
2124300	2124980	I'm not purple.
2125000	2126120	You're splotchy.
2126140	2127041	Oh, no, I'm violet.
2127781	2128401	Damn gum.
2128821	2129261	Okay, anyways.
2131522	2132502	I turned into a blueberry.
2135283	2135543	All right.
2138323	2139283	Oh, it's so much fun.
2139743	2140624	I couldn't resist.
2140644	2141484	I had to do it one more time.
2142224	2142524	All right.
2142544	2144085	That won't be the last time, I'm sure.
2144105	2144625	Moving on.
2144965	2149646	It's going to be cut down into a little clip, and then you're going to be like, hey, Matt.
2149666	2150687	Hey, Logan, what do you think about this?
2151287	2152067	Oh, it's so much fun.
2152487	2153247	Oh, it's so much fun.
2153447	2154648	Oh, oh, oh, it's so much fun.
2155728	2156148	You know what?
2156188	2160009	Maybe we could compile some of this together and remix it.
2160069	2160630	I have an idea.
2161030	2165171	Let's send them a friendly letter commenting on how wonderful they covered our show.
2166307	2169308	I'm sitting here going, you know what?
2169748	2172348	No TV station give a rat's ass about us before.
2172908	2173809	I look at it this way.
2173869	2175769	It was about podcasting.
2176489	2179870	We were just podcasters who were convenient and had the most interesting material.
2180030	2182751	We were just pawns in the big operation, really.
2183411	2184451	Damn the man!
2185051	2187332	I'm glad they mentioned everybody on the show.
2187432	2188292	Oh wait, no they didn't.
2188332	2189072	That's right, they didn't.
2191132	2191432	Whatever.
2193753	2193973	Anyway.
2194491	2195932	We are going to put that up on the internet.
2196132	2197032	Check our website.
2197333	2198653	You guys will be able to download it soon.
2198673	2200794	Also, big goddamn... You know what they're going to do?
2200814	2203376	They're going to play this at my work in front of goddamn 100 people.
2204416	2205317	Oh, it's so much fun.
2205717	2208859	And we're going to hear all goddamn day long next week.
2209079	2209659	Yay!
2209679	2211740	Oh, great new week!
2212441	2213761	Perfect way to start it off!
2213861	2215642	Thank you, KCRA3!
2215982	2217023	I cannot wait!
2218504	2219064	Are you done?
2219344	2219464	Yes.
2219484	2220085	Are you done yet?
2220125	2220305	No.
2220385	2220725	Thank you.
2221266	2222967	I have actually news that happened to me this week.
2223147	2223547	Oh, what's that?
2223767	2225148	Now that I'm no longer bitter.
2225708	2228430	Actually, I'm going to be addressing most of it during the FUs of the week.
2228930	2229270	My work.
2230751	2231491	My package arrived.
2231851	2232352	My prize.
2233552	2234173	Your package?
2234693	2236174	Did it start off small and get a little bit bigger?
2239355	2240436	Okay, no, seriously, what is it?
2241016	2241897	My gorilla stuff.
2242257	2242697	Oh, that's right.
2242737	2243918	You were a winner on some stuff.
2244018	2244858	I am a winner.
2245899	2247980	I won shit that wasn't really shit.
2248000	2248580	It was really cool.
2249724	2250684	What kind of stuff did you win?
2250944	2252405	Well, it was from Filter Magazine.
2253545	2258607	And first of all, it was going to be just a CD and the autographed magazine.
2258767	2260868	I had misunderstood the first email, the price.
2261768	2271392	But since I already had the CD, and since I actually, you know, when I was talking, I had to actually call the lady to give her my change of address because she didn't get my return email.
2272152	2275153	And we were just talking about stuff, and, you know, I said that, you know,
2276135	2281199	I actually, uh, moderate on Gorillas Unofficial, which is a really cool site for anyone interested.
2281980	2284382	Um, but, uh, what?
2286924	2290587	Nothing, just something, I was giggling at something a listener wants to say.
2290647	2290727	Hey!
2290747	2291167	Jamie time!
2291187	2291488	Sorry.
2293009	2295591	You can either pay attention to me or piss off, okay?
2296231	2296712	Alright.
2298053	2299314	Anyway, as I was saying...
2301056	2310302	Um, because, because, you know, I wasn't just some random person filling out the, the little prize thingy.
2310382	2316746	I actually got, um, a mobile that I haven't seen anywhere else except a couple of lists that I saw on eBay, but that's like it.
2317426	2326692	And I got, um, the autographed magazine, and I got, uh, the sticker sheet, and the little promo book that's like, ooh, cool promo book.
2328453	2329874	So how much would you say all this is worth?
2330549	2330969	On eBay?
2331169	2331329	Yeah.
2331710	2333390	I've seen the promo book go for a lot of money.
2333890	2334191	Cool.
2334971	2337592	So... So what are you going to do with it?
2337612	2339173	Are you going to put it on display in your house somewhere?
2339193	2342714	Are you going to keep it locked away in a little box to take out on days when you need some gorillas?
2343915	2344255	I don't know.
2344315	2347356	What do people do with these things?
2347436	2347836	I don't know.
2348256	2350137	I've never won anything like that before, really.
2350177	2352958	Well, Dan and I have actually been off looking at office furniture.
2354239	2359621	And so once we get the office set up, it's going to go in my area of our office.
2362182	2365665	The most exciting music-related thing I ever won was when I got to meet Matchbox 20.
2366986	2371951	I wasn't even that big a fan of them, but I just won tickets off the radio and backstage passes, so we got to go meet Matchbox 20.
2372571	2375514	And so I just have my little autograph hanging on the wall, but that's about it.
2376428	2381052	I'm not really an autograph collector, you know, but this is just really cool.
2381873	2383434	I'm not much of an autograph collector either.
2383514	2388438	However, I got Rob Thomas to sign my thing and it says, To Rob, I think you're cute.
2389059	2390260	And that's worth saving.
2391401	2392041	That's fun.
2393863	2396665	There's a whole story behind that, but I don't like the story.
2396846	2402010	When we get the scanner hooked up, I'm going to scan the magazine because I love how DJ Danger Mouth signs it.
2403157	2406578	He signs a DM with a circle around it, sort of like the old Danger Mouse logo.
2407839	2408679	I thought that was pretty cool.
2411060	2418043	I had major happy nerd moment right then, and they're just staring at it for about five minutes going, Ooh, Navy Seals!
2418543	2419483	Oh, wrong movie.
2421644	2422304	Going back to it.
2422604	2426026	Oh, since now we've had Jamie time, let's take a minute and have some Loki time.
2427766	2429427	God damn!
2430499	2431400	Out of my foot!
2431880	2434062	Why did I shoot myself in my foot?
2434462	2436264	Oh my god, it hurts so bad!
2439386	2440427	No, my foot!
2440487	2441668	I need that for walking!
2442509	2444711	It's only funny if you were there for that episode.
2445371	2449034	Well, somebody in the chatroom asked if I still had that sound clip, so I just had to play it for them.
2449995	2451937	We need to have some Loki singing during the break.
2452317	2456320	We also... I think I actually deleted those mp3s finally.
2456360	2456941	No!
2457181	2458282	I got them somewhere, I don't know.
2458302	2459443	They are safe in my... No!
2461081	2463461	Sakurina has a comment here in our chat room.
2463481	2468602	It has a suggestion for DarkSakura's next advice column on your show.
2469142	2472003	Yes, the advice column's theme would be how to piss off Loki.
2472683	2473223	And here we go.
2473703	2475724	Number one, get his foot on TV.
2476664	2478724	Number two, oh my god, it's so much fun.
2479824	2482245	Number three, talk about how In The Groove is awesome.
2483185	2484985	Number four, say you'll buy him a Mac.
2486106	2488406	And the final piece of advice, just stay away.
2490089	2490930	That would piss him off.
2492091	2492451	I don't know.
2493312	2500798	Well, you know how usually your final piece of advice is, you know, just don't, like when you're doing that, how to, you know, fly out of a cannon, your final piece of advice is don't get in the fucking cannon.
2501779	2508584	I was thinking that my advice was going to be on how to safely inflate your ego without it exploding into brain bits all over your company.
2508704	2509505	Well, that'll work.
2509985	2511327	I've been having lots of practice with that.
2511707	2513128	I have an advice column.
2513168	2514829	It's how to shoot an interview.
2516731	2517912	Because apparently, you know,
2519827	2522836	I was watching the other segments that they cut to.
2524244	2549926	Before ours, so meaning these were more important That would be that it's hot The same story they've covered all week Oh, guess what, it's still hot In case you didn't figure that out by walking outside Loki, if you wanted to headline the news Let's get Joe Hotperson on the street and see what he thinks It's hot out here Come on You know what, when I want to know exactly how hot it is I go to the Weather Channel's website and put in my damn zip code
2550973	2551934	And then I know it's hot.
2552194	2555798	Loki, if you want to be headline news, kill someone.
2556298	2557479	Then you'll headline the news.
2557819	2558580	Yeah, thank you.
2558600	2559821	And it'll be press for us.
2559861	2561002	We caught a killer today.
2561463	2564246	This guy's the host of Orange Lounge Radio.
2564786	2570151	Ghost poster and kills 50 nuns because his foot was the only thing on the TV.
2574522	2585231	I should be a reporter.
2585271	2591295	It looks like it's another crazy killer who is inspired by the Grand Theft Auto San Andreas games.
2591676	2597000	When asked about how much he enjoys Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, the killer replied, It's so much fun.
2600379	2604244	GameStop is no longer allowed to take them in as trade-ins.
2611909	2614010	Yes, because they're not going to be selling it anymore.
2638476	2639397	Subtitles by the Amara.org community
2654600	2658864	I was going to save this for the podcast, but now you've got me on this subject, so I want to talk about this.
2658944	2662527	Okay, we've seen this happen before, with DDR even, right?
2662947	2668812	Remember how when you put in the DDR USA, remember the very first release of DDR USA on the PlayStation?
2669152	2674317	As poopy of a game as it was, it was what got DDR in the door on PlayStation here in the U.S.,
2674717	2701518	remember that people put in that disc and they hacked it and what did they find on the disc they found the background for Butterfly and they found the background for Bad Girls but with the gun taken out so this obviously was at one point or another those songs were meant to be even if not Butterfly if they were just lazy from the Best Hits conversion and left that in there somebody altered the Bad Girls background that song was intended to be in DDR USA at one point or another but instead of
2702088	2711394	What they did, instead of removing the song, removing the background, removing everything from the code completely, all they did was they took the pointer out.
2711434	2714637	The thing that points to bad girls as being a song in the game, they took that out.
2714997	2717719	I think that's exactly what they did with Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.
2718099	2722462	I think that this sex thing was intended to be in the game the whole time.
2722882	2730455	But during some final QA review process or something, they decided, you know what, if we have this sex thing in the game, I think that's crossing the line.
2730795	2737246	So instead of going through the efforts to take it out of the programming, which would be a pain in the ass, they simply took the pointer out.
2738254	2767115	and so they thought well if we just take the pointer out you take everything that points to the sex thing out nobody's going to find the sex thing because all the pointers are out whoops did they underestimate the PC hack community out there once the PC hack community found it it was just a matter of time before somebody got the codes to basically what they're doing is putting a pointer in that points back to the sex game and now it's this whole big thing of oh Rockstar Games knew it all along that they were going to have this sex game well yeah they knew they had a sex game in there but they thought they took it out
2767555	2770337	It's lazy programming, is what happened here, I think.
2770697	2773778	It's still retarded, though, that people are coming after this game.
2773878	2775159	But anyways, we'll see you on the third podcast.
2777020	2778461	Well, now you got me started on that.
2779521	2781242	Let's talk about how In the Groove sucks.
2782703	2785304	You know, I'm gonna... We do that every show!
2785324	2788366	I know, and I'm not even... I don't even think In the Groove sucks as much as you do.
2788386	2791327	I didn't quite have the budget to buy In the Groove today.
2791347	2796990	I thought about doing it just so I could play it once and say it sucks, and then write it sucks ass on the front cover.
2797492	2799514	and then, you know, give it away.
2800254	2802476	But, yeah.
2803577	2807141	I actually plan on playing In the Groove 2 two weeks from now.
2807401	2816529	I'll be playing In the Groove 2 because I'm doing my East Coast trip and I'm going to go buy aid on the break while I'm out there and I'm going to check out In the Groove 2 so I can come back and give a review on the show.
2817525	2819968	I can tell Loki that it's probably not as bad as he thinks it is.
2820168	2820888	Yeah, it's going to be awesome.
2820909	2822670	It's going to have it on a new HDTV.
2823491	2827495	So it's going to be really crisp and higher quality looking graphics.
2827515	2828215	They still suck!
2828676	2829757	They still suck!
2830257	2831859	They're just going to be on a bigger TV!
2832239	2833400	Wow, crap blown up!
2838705	2842949	Just like saying all the speakers in the world will not make those songs any better.
2847928	2848469	What can he do?
2849029	2849889	Maybe, you know what?
2849909	2850890	Knock it off!
2851390	2853251	Stop playing the damn video clip!
2853291	2856412	I think, though, one day, one day, you guys, there's hope.
2856472	2857552	Loki will change his mind.
2857853	2861094	And we'll sit here and we'll ask him, Loki, what did you think of In The Groove 2?
2861334	2862855	Oh, it's so much fun.
2864135	2865676	For me to hope on!
2870118	2872659	Can we, like, change the topic to something I don't have to yell at?
2873092	2873712	Poppa Music
2897581	2899943	and we'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.
2900203	2902905	Your calls on the Skype line also in this very next break.
2903446	2906248	So we'll be back after some murmur twins kicking it off.
2952253	2952795	Thank you.
2982910	2984155	Thanks for watching!
3196560	3197541	Thanks for watching!
3259608	3260609	Thank you for watching
3333558	3339361	Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio because real radio makes Captain Jack cry
3343891	3344532	Orange Lounge Radio
3366512	3367652	Good times.
3367712	3368312	The old days.
3368372	3371253	That was the porno that was inspired by Dance Dance Revolution somehow.
3371333	3374215	When I say inspired by... Very loosely.
3374235	3376235	Yeah, like most of the girls in it.
3377236	3379877	Like, I don't even think there was a part other than the title.
3379917	3380717	But they dance.
3381097	3389140	It was like Dance Dance Fuck Max something six or... Yeah, it was like Dance Dance Fuck Six or something.
3389160	3389921	I don't know.
3389961	3391021	Dance Dance Fuck Max.
3391061	3391821	I don't remember what it was.
3392162	3393322	That was years old though.
3394612	3417574	I always thought the porno that had the Final Fantasy X Final Fuck X That was the better one It was good cosplay Yeah, they had some good cosplayers in them And then they got naked and had sex But the Lulu actually had a little stuffed muggle Anyway Sorry kids
3419679	3421681	Oh yeah, by the way, children, don't listen to this program.
3421821	3422161	It's bad.
3422481	3422862	Bad for you.
3423142	3425484	You know, I'm scared that I might have co-workers listening to this.
3426524	3431228	Because they all found out about the news thing that happened last Friday and some were asking, what's the web address?
3431248	3431888	What's the web address?
3431928	3434070	I'm like, I don't care anymore.
3434570	3434911	I don't.
3435231	3436692	Honestly, I don't.
3438033	3439214	It's just, it's not worth it.
3439474	3440015	It's not worth it.
3440035	3440295	I just,
3440868	3444670	DarkSakura, you keep it under wraps pretty good, which your weekend hobby is.
3445090	3445550	Hell no!
3445690	3447091	I tell everyone, hey, I'm on the radio!
3447291	3447611	Really?
3447891	3450092	Hey, listen to this, hey, look at this, because I don't really care.
3450272	3452473	You're not worried about them hearing you talk about Dance Dance Fuck?
3452773	3453234	No.
3454874	3456055	They've seen my cubicle.
3457636	3458756	Oh, they know you're into porn.
3458816	3460917	No, I am not into porn, okay?
3462438	3465059	That was Loki's piece of crap.
3466923	3470265	Hey, I was looking for quality Dance Dance Revolution products.
3470325	3473166	I came upon that and I was like, quality.
3473186	3475528	I was like, I have to get that.
3475628	3479630	Okay, I have the Happy Bunny magnet that you gave me in my cubicle.
3479990	3484613	With Happy Bunny pointing down to his crotch saying, I bet you love my thingy.
3487454	3490776	I'm going to be taking my other one there too that says, I love everybody except you assholes.
3492997	3493637	I don't think I have...
3496399	3497900	I think you mentioned it a couple times.
3498680	3505242	I like my job, but since I'm a presenter, I'm in front of people most of the time, I have to stay politically correct.
3505542	3506943	It's a very interesting challenge.
3507143	3524388	Some of my friends theorize that's why I do this program, is because I have to be so politically correct when I'm in front of a class teaching that this is my way of venting the other half of that, the unpolitically correct side of me, where I get to come on and say shit, piss, fuck, and people listen to that and laugh at it.
3526502	3528804	You mean they don't throw lawsuits our way?
3529505	3530226	Why is that?
3530826	3531767	Because we're on the interweb.
3531787	3533128	That's right.
3533969	3534690	No one likes the internet.
3535291	3539094	Speaking of places you can't say shit, fuck, and cunt, there was...
3540131	3542373	All three of us need to try out a new co-host.
3542413	3545835	Because you know Loki on Attack of the Show would be hilarious.
3545855	3545935	Yeah.
3569073	3570714	Let's come on the show drunk every day.
3570754	3571995	Oh my god, it's so much fun.
3575116	3576157	No, I'm seriously thinking about doing it.
3576477	3583581	My only issue is, though, since I'm going to be gone for two weeks, I have a feeling that that's when they're going to be here in San Francisco is when I'm gone, so I'm not going to be able to do it.
3583901	3588923	And they're going to miss out on a great candidate if I can't be there to do it.
3589864	3592445	So... I don't know.
3592465	3597428	They're just going to get some big breasted chick that doesn't know jack about technology done.
3599355	3603177	Hey, I should apply.
3603397	3609280	You may have adequate boobage, but you actually know technology.
3609340	3611961	You have a bigger gaming collection than the two of us combined.
3612161	3615723	I have a bigger gaming collection than each of you combined.
3616564	3620306	Just grab one of the chicks off that stupid show, The Whipset, or whatever.
3620546	3624648	I'll go to the audition with my Turbo Express and my WonderSwan.
3624668	3625228	Well, here's the thing.
3625268	3633552	I was looking at the KevinPereira.com, which is the guy that's still the host on Attack of the Show, who, by the way, I like more and more as I see the show more and more.
3633612	3637494	When the screensavers first came out, I was kind of like, okay, this guy's a boob.
3637554	3638035	I don't like him.
3638495	3644698	But I'm really warming up to him, and I think what they're trying to do with the show, he really does kind of fit it, and he's kind of funny.
3645058	3646961	and I think now that he's... Yeah, he'll have to go.
3649063	3655250	I think when it first started as the screensavers, I think it was always kind of trying to fit a square peg in a round hole kind of thing.
3655571	3661257	And I think he realizes this, so even if, you know, for some weird reason you heard me saying this, you wouldn't be offended because I think he realizes this.
3661478	3664081	Because even he says that first episode of the screensavers was bad.
3665083	3666744	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3687466	3690987	But we're not looking for someone that just is about the technology.
3691027	3693868	We're looking for someone that wants to be on TV talking about technology.
3694208	3696449	And for some reason, they're having a hard time finding that.
3696929	3697569	Yes, DarkSakura?
3698310	3699110	I'm volunteering.
3699690	3700750	But wait a minute, though.
3700790	3704071	You don't want us to point the webcam at you, yet you would be on television?
3705692	3706512	I'd hire a trainer.
3707893	3708413	I'd do it.
3709333	3710573	I could talk about technology.
3710613	3711914	That's all I talk about.
3712234	3713714	You want to get me to lose weight?
3713734	3715135	Put me in a social situation.
3716684	3717905	Every freaking day.
3718585	3719125	I hear knocking.
3719145	3721006	I guarantee you I won't eat for a month.
3721666	3722306	I hear knocking.
3722767	3726208	I hear cabinets is what I hear.
3728589	3729389	I heard knocking.
3733011	3733471	I could do it.
3734612	3734852	Easy.
3736392	3736653	Easy.
3738573	3739174	It's so much fun.
3740294	3740574	Is it?
3740894	3741355	Is it now?
3741575	3743155	You know it's tiny, but it's grown.
3744276	3744496	Yeah.
3747113	3748313	Rob, you abandoned us.
3748373	3749094	How dare you?
3749114	3751454	50 lashes with a chocolate whip.
3753155	3753935	To hell, Rob.
3753955	3756336	You can't go on an antagonist show because we need to do our show.
3758317	3763498	If somebody offered me money to do a live television show, I'd be all, screw you guys.
3763718	3764599	I'm going to L.A.
3765319	3765879	No, I'm just kidding.
3765919	3768060	I love you guys.
3768840	3770201	I'd at least give you my two weeks.
3770261	3770601	Come on.
3771961	3772461	Bastard.
3772801	3773522	At that point...
3775455	3777816	At that point, you have a Menchie hat!
3779396	3779656	Give!
3779676	3782336	From Anime Expo, you want it?
3782536	3782756	Yes.
3783657	3784777	I have a Menchie hat.
3786837	3788357	Anyway, let's eat her!
3788577	3790338	She's the emergency food supply!
3790858	3792218	I have a Menchie hat.
3792478	3799219	Anyway, joining us, by the way, who hasn't been at this show in an awfully long time is the one and only Explicit, with three X's.
3799259	3800059	Our angry guy.
3801360	3803540	Just what we need this show.
3804751	3805991	I'm not going to be angry this time.
3806011	3807972	I got some more important than that.
3808292	3809492	More important than just being angry.
3809873	3817555	Now, we were talking about TV earlier, and we were talking about Attack of the Show and how we're all going to be on it soon, because we want to do that.
3819636	3824477	Supposedly, some folks were emailing them, too, about us going on, so I don't know.
3824917	3827818	Nobody contacted us, so I guess it wasn't enough people, so...
3828376	3832539	Go email them and tell them we're ready to whore ourselves out to be on cable.
3832719	3836722	Because we figure, okay, we've done the newspaper, we've done local TV, now we have to do basic cable.
3837083	3838824	That's the next step up.
3838984	3843348	So far, like, I'm in Canada, Tony and me got the spotlight right there.
3843508	3847691	Now, I was going to say, what happened... Now, you also had a television experience recently.
3847751	3849993	We had Channel 3, but you had another station in town.
3850013	3850913	What was yours the thing about?
3851734	3852715	It was basically like...
3853215	3868998	The scenery of the DDR, and introducing the game to people for both perfect attack and freestyle, in addition to how this one person lost this much weight on DDR,
3870165	3872347	So they were kind of doing more of like a DDR story.
3873348	3883677	They were doing that typical Dance Dance Revolution in the news story where DDR, it's better than Grand Theft Auto because instead of making kids want to kill people, it makes them get up and exercise and want to lose weight.
3884378	3889562	But then, now the little piece I saw of it had Andrew dressed up like a pirate.
3890063	3890883	Yep, that's true.
3891103	3895467	And that other guy that's always with him dressed up as Darth Vader.
3896108	3896848	A different Andrew.
3897169	3897369	Yeah.
3898140	3901602	And they were just, you know, being themselves, but on TV.
3901762	3903582	Or in the media, I guess.
3904023	3904263	Yes.
3904683	3906464	I would have totally gone if I didn't have to work.
3906904	3907204	Yeah.
3907364	3909125	You would bring Orange Eyes Radio to the TV.
3909665	3913207	Yeah, so we had to go get our own gig, since we couldn't go to yours.
3913687	3917169	I heard about Channel 3, so... We actually, we played the clip earlier, you missed it.
3917389	3918549	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
3918889	3919229	Oh, oh.
3922031	3924272	Oh, Loki, I'm so glad you suggested it here.
3924532	3926093	Let me get to the little piece here.
3926113	3926813	I found it.
3927878	3928378	What'd you find?
3929039	3929779	What'd you find, DarkSakura?
3929919	3931920	I found the Menchie hat, because I want one now.
3934221	3934861	You want that?
3936182	3936462	Alright.
3936902	3937902	Yes, this is from Anime Expo.
3937922	3939723	I'm just giving away some stuff from Anime Expo.
3939803	3939943	Okay!
3940604	3941804	If you don't want the Menchie hat, sure!
3942304	3942865	Alright, thanks.
3943125	3944125	This is just for you, Jonas.
3944165	3944966	Menchie hat!
3945106	3947106	Um, Loki, what did you think about being on television?
3947387	3948367	Oh, it's so much fun.
3948607	3949007	It's great.
3950328	3951829	That was Loki's big television debut.
3952269	3953029	That was it!
3958107	3958728	Oh, wow.
3960449	3960729	Anyway.
3961089	3963731	Yeah, from what I heard from the taping, though.
3964132	3965473	Loki, you know what this is?
3967174	3969175	The world's smallest violin playing My Heart Bleeds For You.
3970576	3983406	Yeah, from what I've heard from the taping, like, the two Andrews were there, and some background people doing PA, and then me and Cam Canada doing a little freestyle to introduce it to the scenery.
3984321	3990224	And I'm not really sure if Scott Farah, the gaming guy of Channel 31 KMAX, introduced the tournament.
3990304	3993386	I didn't even know we had a gaming guy on local television.
3993887	3994907	We had a gaming guy?
3995247	3997929	Yeah, his name is Scott Farah on the morning show.
3998409	3999470	Usually he's there on Mondays.
4000210	4000791	On the guy.
4001251	4002031	The gaming guy.
4002512	4003432	Is that his job?
4003472	4005873	Is that strictly his job is to be the gaming guy?
4006214	4008115	Dude, I want to be the gaming guy!
4009429	4009949	I'm cute.
4010289	4011149	I can be on TV.
4011189	4014070	You're going to be there on the tournament if you're still interested in going on the 30th.
4014170	4019731	I might, except I have a flight leaving the very next day, so I'm going to try and make it.
4019751	4022852	Tell us, plug your tournament, plug your tourney thing that you're doing.
4023452	4029734	Well, we had one tournament, they won the tournament already on yesterday for the initial D section.
4030074	4030374	Oh yeah?
4030914	4031354	How'd that go?
4031594	4038096	It turned out pretty okay, so-so in certain ways, because we had some problems with someone's card didn't read it.
4038536	4038736	Mm-hmm.
4039246	4042989	But then again, they said the car was bent, so I don't know what happened.
4044070	4045171	It was eight competitors.
4045251	4048234	The first place winner was some guy named Jay.
4049115	4052958	Second place was T, and third was Kenshin.
4053899	4055480	Jonas, you know what you and I need to do?
4056121	4057082	We need to work on Shaft 2.
4058695	4059055	Oh yes.
4061357	4063878	But we're going to post it though, so far.
4064378	4065019	What's your plans?
4065059	4067080	Yeah, but I need to, we need to talk.
4067300	4073744	Because I've been needing to get Shaft to run for a while and they've been kind of being assholes at RVGL.
4074424	4077646	Oh, that's what I don't do with RVGL.
4077746	4079868	Their management with tournaments, no.
4081088	4085671	This facility would be great, otherwise I don't want to deal with what's-his-face.
4086806	4092928	No, it's funny, because their management also put repairing their machines as no, and listening to the customers as no.
4093789	4095389	It's really ironic the way that works.
4095449	4096470	Wait, wait, wait, wait.
4096490	4097370	Are you serious?
4099391	4102832	Okay, first of all, RV Chill's a business, so... We'll ask you in the chat room.
4102972	4103993	Hold the microphone a little bit back.
4104233	4104473	Okay.
4104573	4109355	Which is funny, because Jonas actually doesn't hold his microphone that close to his mouth.
4109395	4111015	He's just got that kind of voice, kids.
4111496	4112036	But that's all right.
4112356	4112596	I mean...
4113223	4117205	Let's see, I don't know why RBGL doesn't want a tournament, because I've done this before myself.
4118325	4126228	Well, that's where FU was supposed to be held, but then I decided to do PI because that's the only place that would host a tournament.
4128169	4131890	Scandia, they want to do their own gig.
4132010	4133671	Of course, you've been to one of their tournaments.
4134995	4136676	I did go to one of those Scandia tournaments.
4136716	4137216	It was okay.
4137256	4137736	It was cute.
4138496	4140637	It wasn't like a large-scale DDR tournament.
4140657	4143578	It wasn't the kind of thing you should drive in from San Francisco for, but it was cute.
4143998	4144458	Yeah, I know.
4145238	4146439	Yeah.
4146499	4150660	First off, Jamie, first I'll take care of the tournament that's happening this Saturday.
4151100	4152401	Then we'll talk about Shaft 2.
4153501	4155622	No, I meant Shaft 2 because I've got to deal with school starting.
4156082	4158403	Once I get in my school schedule, I'll have more time to plot to that.
4158703	4159263	All right.
4159283	4161524	Just give me a call anytime and reply and we'll see what's up.
4162632	4165734	So many people want to help out with the whole tournament issues.
4166014	4175259	And Shaft had such a good turnout, and it ended up being one of the big ones when it was out, that I think that, you know, putting the name on it would give us a big draw-in.
4175600	4176240	We'll see what happens.
4176420	4178962	We got a few people, we got a couple of the Yamaha people.
4179382	4180382	Yeah, I remember that, that was pretty cool.
4181023	4181943	It was a good time.
4182163	4184925	And the 2DX tournament, too, was cool, except we won't be having that again.
4184945	4185726	Wasn't that Marsh Brandes, though?
4186206	4187086	Uh, we did it at Shaft, too.
4187106	4187747	That was at Shaft.
4187907	4188947	We did both, it was both.
4189428	4190088	Oh, okay.
4191209	4191469	Anyway...
4192536	4198401	What we're going to do now, I was going to talk about the MidiHead thing, so let me get into that.
4200543	4206827	MidiHead, our buddy that had a song over in Ultramix 2, he did, you know, the In My Eyes remix was in Ultramix 2, remember that?
4207608	4211371	Pretty good song there, very well liked, fan favorite.
4211611	4213373	He's back, he's going to be in...
4215126	4215907	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4243397	4245878	What MidiHead did is he kind of put this whole show together.
4245918	4251039	He engineered this 30-minute show where he plays his track from Ultramix 2.
4251439	4255660	He played the Wraith song from his upcoming album.
4256021	4259041	He played... What else did he play?
4259081	4260822	He played Raise Your Hands.
4260902	4262522	He played Take Me Away From Here.
4262982	4264543	And then he plays the new...
4265430	4265871	Jellykiss
4294886	4296848	So it sounds pretty cool.
4315612	4317273	It sounds like it's going to be a fun little remix there.
4317613	4323294	I remember playing it at E3, and I loved the remix of Jelly Kiss, so it was probably my favorite thing.
4323615	4324615	I actually tried to play it.
4325655	4326636	What did you think of the song?
4327056	4329356	My hip ended up being a screaming nightmare of agony.
4331217	4332397	But that's not because of the song.
4333238	4333978	No, I liked the song.
4333998	4334678	I wish I could have played it.
4334698	4337539	I only got halfway through it before my hip gave out on me.
4339003	4343145	Check that out on DDRFreak.com You can just download the MP3 right there.
4343165	4348908	Which, by the way, I think would probably be the only time I've ever seen a Bomani-related MP3 so blatantly on DDRFreak.
4349268	4350648	So that's kind of a historical thing as well.
4350668	4351128	So check that out.
4351208	4351389	It's nice.
4366764	4374387	Bimani Style isn't hosting the file per se, but they ran an article on it, and so did DDRUK.
4374688	4380890	And that's thanks to one of our listeners, actually, who is mod on all those sites.
4382591	4383571	Anyway, check that out.
4384312	4384952	It's a good time.
4386058	4387519	It's a good podcast.
4388280	4392984	The thing about MiniHead, too, is he does these funny radio voiceovers during the whole thing, too.
4393044	4395026	He's just like, this is MiniHead!
4395206	4397167	He's just going crazy during the whole thing.
4398168	4399870	Yeah, you got a shout-out on the thing.
4400450	4401311	I didn't get a shout-out.
4401351	4402192	Jamie didn't get a shout-out.
4402212	4402932	You got a shout-out.
4403513	4404153	Your mic's not on.
4405194	4407516	Damn straight, because the mic needs to be on.
4408177	4408777	Because I'm awesome.
4410859	4411860	And I hang out on his forums.
4412594	4415977	Yeah, you just get it because you have to shout out because you hang out on the forums.
4415997	4419220	That's what it is, basically, what it boils down to.
4420321	4422282	So, Loki, what did you think of the Middy Head podcast?
4422302	4422963	It's so much fun.
4423183	4423964	It's great.
4428527	4431150	Not as much fun as this McDonald's barbecue sauce.
4432628	4437794	All right, since you guys are eating... By the way, MidiHead also teases the fact that there's a third song he's going to have in the game.
4438034	4442960	He pretty much all but says, I have a third song in Ultramix 3, but he's teasing us.
4443020	4444301	He's not telling us what that song is.
4444542	4452691	So we're assuming that the reason why you might want to subscribe to the podcast and not just download the direct file, unless you're lazy and don't want to set up podcasting...
4453892	4462595	You probably want to subscribe to the podcast because whenever this third song is announced he will probably do a podcast part two and that's going to be the first place you're going to hear this new song.
4464516	4468938	So he pretty much all but said he's going to have a third song in the game so we're kind of interested to see what that is.
4470089	4476631	But you notice that they've kind of in general been very, very quiet about these recent DDR games.
4476911	4479232	Like they haven't been doing the clues.
4479692	4484013	They usually do the clues around this time where people try to guess what the songs are that are going to be in the game.
4484393	4486514	They haven't been saying a whole lot about the features.
4486794	4491135	We've really gotten not a lot since E3 besides this MIDI head thing.
4491315	4491715	Not a problem.
4491735	4496057	We'll send another demo for GamePro to review and boom!
4496097	4496597	There you go.
4496617	4497177	There's everything.
4498047	4500708	Why do you think that is, that they're being so tight-lipped about it this time?
4500968	4501828	Because GamePro sucks?
4502088	4503108	No, not GamePro.
4503148	4504348	It has nothing to do with GamePro.
4504368	4509349	I'm talking about, in general, Konami's lack of playing around on the forums.
4509729	4514851	I mean, some of the Konami reps are playing on DDR Freak, and they chime in once in a while.
4515471	4523432	Even Miklatov, who's been on the show a couple times, he's jumped in there, but you notice that when Miklatov has been on the show, he hasn't said anything.
4523472	4526293	Not nearly what he was telling us this time last year.
4527086	4532792	On the show, he's not saying a whole lot about the new games.
4533493	4538017	Well, they're doing some weird things with the releases coming out.
4539178	4542021	Good things, but weird things.
4542442	4548247	I'm thinking they're probably just going to keep it in the wrap so when it comes out and people go, Oh, wow!
4548488	4550189	Instead of, Ah, it sounds like crap.
4550229	4550830	And then they don't buy it.
4551499	4553440	So, it's more of a shock factor.
4553701	4554962	They don't really have to give hints.
4555022	4555282	Why?
4555362	4557944	No other companies give hints about what their games are going to be like.
4558524	4559165	Fuck it, wait.
4559785	4560245	Be patient.
4560385	4563508	Rockstar's on their forums going, hey guys, did you know you can unlock a sex game?
4565849	4566210	You know what?
4566270	4576117	I think there was an E3 strategy that worked very well for them, and that is that they didn't say shit about Beatmania USA until E3 itself.
4576197	4577818	It was a very, very quiet thing.
4578138	4580420	They had said, oh yeah, we're going to have, you know,
4580842	4583306	Extreme 2 and DDR Ultimix 3 and all that stuff.
4583346	4588333	But they didn't say anything about... They didn't say anything about Beatmania.
4589403	4595469	Because if they had said something about Beatmania, people were going to come up with all these preconceived notions about what they wanted in Beatmania.
4595750	4598272	And when that wasn't met, they were going to be disappointed.
4598773	4601015	I have a feeling it's a similar thing they're doing here.
4601295	4609383	They're not saying anything about the games, because if they do, people are just going to go, Why isn't this feature in the game?
4609704	4611285	Why didn't they put this song in?
4612987	4625934	I think they're just trying to avoid that this time because it seems like that's what happens when they tell us the song list is people go, although there are the people that are appreciative of the hints and that deserve to know these things in advance, there's just a few bad apples that ruin it for everyone.
4625954	4632017	The people that get on there and go, why don't we get this song and why haven't we gotten Cartoon Heroes and DDR yet?
4632717	4637780	Wasn't Genie in a Bottle in DDR Extreme 2?
4637820	4642642	They had something like Christina Aguilera's song or something like that.
4643246	4643446	Right.
4645648	4647709	And then they got, like, Britney, I think, in there, too.
4647729	4650751	I don't know.
4650831	4654233	I'm actually interested to hear those again.
4655113	4655434	I don't know.
4655654	4656895	They weren't in the E3 thing, though.
4656935	4658496	It was just a preview.
4658516	4659236	They had a clip.
4659256	4659996	They had a thing.
4660016	4666440	There was a clip of the Genie in the Bottle thing that was on some video of somebody from E3 or something.
4666460	4666781	That's right.
4666901	4670423	No, they did have Genie in the Bottle in the E3 demo, but it was so freaking loud you couldn't hear it.
4670748	4676650	That's right, and I thought that they mentioned something about Oops I Did It Again, too, being in there.
4677090	4680992	Because I remember after that, people were like, Oh, long versions are coming back!
4681052	4683312	And we're like, no.
4683573	4690975	Oops wasn't in there, but I think it's kind of assumed that it's going to be a different cut of Oops I Did It Again.
4692416	4693256	Alright, anyway.
4694212	4706138	I'm just kind of reading what's going on in the chat room, and I think some people are kind of agreeing with the same thing, that, you know, people are basically... Konami isn't wanting to deal with the obnoxious people that whine about everything they release, and all that other stuff going on there.
4709379	4710760	And then, let's see.
4711400	4714201	I thought the E3 build of Beatmania was just a throw together.
4715742	4719524	I think in some ways it was, because some things weren't enabled in there, but I think...
4720788	4723549	I think it's going to be what they're going in the direction towards.
4723589	4728252	I think it is going to be basically a night style redone for us with different songs.
4728592	4732414	And the whole five key songs and five key mode, which I think is pretty cool.
4732674	4738197	I don't know if it was necessarily thrown together because that five key song and five key mode probably took a little extra programming.
4738257	4739397	It's supposed to be thrown together.
4739437	4740378	That's what a beta is.
4740698	4747223	I think they wanted to show what they were going to do, but not, I mean, obviously they probably haven't made a lot of progress on the game because they're working on the DDRs.
4747343	4750845	You kind of wonder with these fans, oh, what, I expect the full game to be done.
4751005	4751826	No, you idiot.
4751886	4753547	They're not going to have the full game done.
4753587	4755168	It's obviously a work in progress.
4755709	4758251	I mean, they're just showing off what they have.
4758311	4761653	That's why they have the E3 version.
4761833	4768998	I mean, people are like, oh, the full game's going to suck because it doesn't have 7 key and wine.
4769559	4770079	So, you know,
4772102	4775423	Alright, what we're going to do now, I guess we're going to go to a break.
4775463	4778164	When we come back from break, we'll take your calls on Skype.
4778204	4780746	I promise that we do the Skype thing this break, but we didn't get around to it.
4781206	4784007	So we'll take your calls on Skype when we come back from this next break.
4784647	4789870	And we will also do the cage match tonight, because I keep promising we're going to get into that as well.
4790490	4792131	So let's start off this break with...
4793274	4795396	I think we'll do some home version song here.
4795717	4796578	Also, you know what I feel like?
4796618	4798540	I feel like playing that one Love is Orange mix.
4798600	4801643	It's a little bit longer of a song, but I think we're going to fit it in here, because I feel like playing that.
4801663	4808591	So we're going to play that, and we'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio and the Cage Match and your calls on the Skype line after this.
4907934	4908814	Thanks for watching!
4948769	4949689	Thank you for watching!
4991201	4991782	DarkSakura
5036693	5037336	Thanks for watching!
5062485	5063446	Thank you for watching!
5105590	5106313	Thanks for watching!
5136714	5137801	Thanks for watching!
5209301	5210421	Thanks for watching!
5245427	5250969	Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song, Orange Lounge Radio.
5252030	5254611	Hi kids, we're back with more Orange Lounge Radio here.
5254631	5261794	We're going to get into the cage match somewhat shortly, but we also wanted to start taking your calls on the Skype line.
5261874	5264756	So if you want to call us, head on over to the Skype line.
5264816	5274840	It's www.orangeloungeradio.com and just click on interact with us and it has all the information that you need to call us and talk live with us.
5275598	5280702	And so while we have that open up, I don't see a whole lot of people signed in.
5280742	5281602	Maybe we'll get a couple calls.
5281622	5281922	We'll see.
5284324	5286906	But meanwhile, I want to remind you guys about something.
5287726	5288847	Podcast Awards.
5289087	5291909	We were nominated in the recent Podcast Awards.
5292389	5293590	So you should vote for us.
5293670	5300395	Head on over to www.podcastawards.com and make sure that you vote for us once every day.
5301823	5302744	Good evening, everyone.
5302764	5303004	Good evening.
5303024	5303444	How are you?
5303524	5303805	I'm fine.
5332014	5336397	Well, just, you know, just some off-topic stuff.
5336617	5340959	I got some 2DX, you know, Happy Sky, some entering stuff about Happy Sky.
5341259	5342640	Ooh, what's going on with Happy Sky?
5342980	5344941	I'm going to get to those MP3s you sent me later, too.
5345021	5345682	I haven't forgotten.
5345722	5347143	I just want to save it for later.
5348683	5350404	Well, you can play a small clip if you want.
5350805	5353026	I'm just going to announce some hidden songs.
5353502	5354623	Unless they're upgraded to a new 2DX mix.
5375259	5377761	Okay, we have a little clip of that one here.
5407350	5408010	Alright, cool.
5409950	5410591	Let me check.
5411111	5413791	It's by Hoshino Kanako, and it's Get Cold.
5414811	5416432	Is that this one that doesn't have a label on it?
5416472	5416992	Is that this one?
5420332	5421693	Oh, that's not Get Cold.
5421853	5422693	Oh, uh-oh.
5422813	5423813	I don't know which one that was then.
5424813	5425553	Maybe I don't have that one.
5427033	5428354	Do you know which one that was I just played?
5429014	5429554	Oh, never mind.
5430614	5432895	I'll just say the next song.
5432935	5434815	It's Plasma by...
5440828	5442709	Soda Fujimori did Plasma, yes?
5443249	5445390	Alright, here's a clip of Plasma.
5452452	5453732	This one sounds kind of cool, okay.
5454452	5457913	Kind of sounds like every other Soda Fujimori song, but that's alright.
5457973	5463175	I don't know if I have that one.
5463255	5464075	Did you send me everything?
5466215	5469017	I have... I forgot to send you... Oh, okay.
5469117	5469377	All right.
5471079	5475122	And then the last one is... This is going to be a very complicated to say.
5477163	5477824	It's by Ginger.
5477904	5482507	It's called... That sounds like it should have a long, complicated name.
5482527	5483928	That's kind of interesting.
5483969	5484089	Okay.
5492955	5494576	This one's translated into English.
5496097	5498538	I just translated it on some site.
5499139	5500239	And it says, What?
5500319	5502521	That's what it's translated.
5502761	5502981	Okay.
5503801	5505983	What the hell?
5506003	5506123	Weird.
5511817	5518461	And here's some stuff about Hidden Plus and Sudden Plus.
5518501	5519481	Here's something interesting.
5522423	5534851	On Hidden Plus and Sudden Plus, you can actually change the width of the cover not only before the song begins, but also during gameplay by holding the start button and adjusting it with the turntable.
5536789	5537049	Weird.
5537209	5541311	So you can actually adjust the windows that you're hiding or, you know, either way.
5541371	5542091	That's kind of neat.
5542251	5543392	Yeah.
5543652	5543892	Huh.
5543912	5547114	Yeah, not only before the song starts, but during gameplay.
5547934	5548974	Wow, that's kind of cool.
5549095	5549495	I like that.
5549775	5560199	So, like, if you decide that, oh, a little too much on the sudden thing, or maybe I put it on accidentally, then I could just use the start button to, like, take it off by rolling it so much that it would just not be there.
5560320	5560920	That's kind of neat.
5561060	5561220	Yeah.
5562185	5571068	And then there's already a new way of accessing the extra stage, which is Scream Squad by Cap.
5572188	5578950	And the way you do it is, on the first and second stage, you have to double A in another of any level with hard mode.
5580351	5583432	Oh, so you can get the extra stage that way just by double A-ing in another on hard.
5585052	5585732	I'm not done yet.
5586252	5587413	Oh, okay.
5587733	5590854	On the final stage, you have to double A a level 10 or higher...
5591883	5595645	either in hyper or another with hard mode, no random, no mirror.
5597265	5599346	And that's to get the one more extra stage?
5600687	5602828	No, that's how you get the extra stage.
5603028	5603388	Really?
5603508	5605889	Oh, dang, so they just raised the bar on that, basically.
5605909	5606510	More complicated, yeah.
5606670	5607570	Wow.
5607930	5616594	Usually on the previous 2DX styles, like until 2DX Red, you just double level 8 another with hard mode.
5616994	5617335	Wow.
5617395	5620256	That's the simplest way, but now they made it more complicated.
5620714	5621335	Disco Yotsu Uchi Inochi
5650188	5651568	Well, thank you for issuing that correction.
5651608	5652689	That was very honest of you.
5652709	5654769	I wish the regular media could be that way.
5654809	5660110	Anything else you want to share with us about the 2DX world?
5660210	5660531	Well, just
5679219	5687727	Just to name some artists.
5687988	5691551	I'll just name the artists that have songs.
5691751	5694734	Don't Let It Go by Uchis, Uchida Brothers.
5697296	5699759	And then there's, what do you call it?
5701320	5704103	Spark by Silver Fox Productions featuring Hoshino Kanako.
5707213	5711394	Under the Sky by Minami Sayaka from B4U with Platonix.
5713375	5713795	What else?
5714335	5718496	Yeah, there's Happy Angel by Jun Fichin Takirik or Tahiri.
5719677	5724678	And these are more songs that are in Happy Sky, yes?
5725118	5728940	Yeah, the ones that have Japanese characters that you might not understand.
5728960	5730220	Gotcha, okay, okay.
5730320	5732621	And then there's Garden by Aokiriye.
5733368	5737290	I'll just type them after this call.
5737550	5738150	Works for me.
5739190	5745313	Whenever there are song titles, just point me out and I'll type them in.
5745693	5746173	Sounds good.
5747474	5747674	Yeah.
5748074	5748474	Alrighty.
5748614	5749794	Well, thanks for the call, Siggy.
5749814	5750435	We appreciate it.
5751255	5751535	Alright.
5751735	5752235	Have a good one.
5752255	5753096	Alright.
5753156	5753396	Later.
5753496	5753756	Later.
5754807	5756888	What's our resident 2DX whore, Siggy?
5757088	5757769	Yay whore!
5757829	5760831	Calling us.
5761331	5766034	I was going to load the It's So Much Fun clip again, but I think we've really run out of the ground.
5767655	5767875	Right.
5768795	5769756	What's so much fun?
5770416	5771517	Playing the clip over and over?
5771577	5772298	Is that so much fun?
5772318	5773278	Yes, actually it is.
5773298	5773999	Tons of fun.
5774279	5778741	Somebody said they were going to make a ytmnd.com site out of that.
5779502	5780923	You know that's the site where...
5781992	5784874	Oh, the one I think of is the con one.
5785515	5786195	Have you seen that site?
5787116	5788758	It just repeats that file over and over.
5788818	5789658	Con!
5789959	5790679	Con!
5790719	5794002	And that's the background is the, you know, William Shatner going, ah!
5794682	5795563	Somebody was going to make a site.
5795583	5800927	And you know how, like, now they have this site where you can build your own YTMND site?
5802389	5805251	Somebody's going to build one of those for you going, oh, it's so much fun.
5805411	5806031	Oh, it's so much fun.
5806092	5806672	It'll be hilarious.
5806732	5808013	Anyway, we got another call on Skype.
5808033	5808814	That sounds like a winner.
5809434	5810375	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
5811229	5816313	I'm sorry, but I have to do a little rant here about the whole hot coffee thing.
5816333	5818035	You have to introduce yourself first.
5818615	5819196	I'm Reznor.
5819816	5820317	Hi, Reznor.
5820357	5821298	Reznor calls us quite a bit.
5821338	5822018	The resident drunk.
5823319	5824340	Hey, we like that.
5824440	5827303	I was the resident drunk last night, but I'm okay now.
5828284	5838913	I'm sorry, but the whole media finding... The media is basically behind the times on anything that relates to anything related with a computer or a video game.
5839582	5841063	Ooh, hot shit.
5841123	5842624	There's sex in a video game.
5842684	5843625	We can't have this.
5843945	5850350	But it's fine and alright to have people doing drive-bys and shooting people and ripping off heads.
5850430	5853652	Violence is quite alright, but doing somebody in the ass isn't.
5854335	5858496	Well, this just goes back to what is acceptable in R-rated movies as well.
5858536	5866097	I mean, remember the whole stink with that movie Eyes Wide Shut where, oh no, they're going to show some titties and some penises and it's going to be NC-17.
5866478	5874599	But meanwhile, the latest like Terminator 3 where they just blow shit up left and right is, you know, just a relatively mild R. Exactly.
5874759	5883241	Case in point of horrendous violence being completely accepted would be Dead Alive where in a movie this guy is fighting zombies with a...
5884079	5888181	Freaking Lawnmower strapped to his chest and he runs up to him and chops him in half.
5888521	5897825	Not to mention the fact that he is also de-birthed by his demon mother, sucked right into her vagina and then pulled right the hell back out.
5898145	5899585	Oh my god, I have this movie.
5899625	5900726	I need to watch it now.
5901406	5901846	Sweet.
5902066	5903107	Okay, okay, okay.
5903327	5904287	This inspires me.
5904307	5905508	Zombie movie night at my house.
5907109	5909049	Anyway, let's not segue into zombies.
5909089	5910910	Dead Alive and Wild Hero.
5911290	5912631	Reznor wants to finish his thought.
5912771	5912991	All right.
5914077	5918681	I'm sorry, but the media are complete idiots when it comes to anything technological.
5919661	5920182	Anything.
5921263	5923404	The story on podcasting.
5923504	5924425	Oh, it's so fun.
5925206	5928528	And I just had a local story in the local news.
5928628	5943119	It's like, kids are attending these new parties called LAN parties, where they come together for 24 hours of caffeine-fueled fun, playing very violent games and swapping files back and forth.
5943639	5946461	Hello, we've been doing this crap since what, 1995?
5946741	5949982	It's just now reaching the media?
5950342	5953564	Pull your collective heads out of your asses for a change!
5954024	5954885	Oh my god!
5955025	5961008	I remember the LAN forum, because that's the only way you could play like Doom 2 multiplayer was to do the LAN thing.
5961708	5963749	Yeah, doing dial-up and then have phone calls like $500.
5963889	5967711	I remember playing 11-player Duke Nukem 3D on a LAN.
5967891	5969232	Oh, that's right, Duke Nukem is another one.
5969552	5969772	Anyway.
5971336	5974238	I'm sorry, but the media are just such whores.
5974298	5981964	I'd like to round, as I said in the chat room, I'd like to round them all up in a pit and reenact the scene from HUD where they're shooting the cattle.
5982924	5984466	It's such bullshit.
5986407	5993612	You know what amazes me about this whole thing is that Grand Theft Auto is a bit of a scapegoat because it's not like we have never had sex before.
5994093	5996876	or very, very sexual things in games before.
5997257	5999559	This could go all the way back to Custer's Revenge.
5999619	6009710	Now, granted, Custer's Revenge was not a runaway sales hit, shall we say, and neither was Night Trap, even though that game didn't have sex in it.
6010011	6012894	But God of War has a sex minigame in it.
6013494	6020296	I think the only reason that they're scapegoating Grand Theft Auto is because it's been in the spotlight before.
6020696	6029058	I'm surprised they didn't start whipping out Doom 3 and just saying, oh, there's demonology and rituals and there's blood all over the place.
6029199	6030639	But that's okay because that's blood.
6031394	6045484	Exactly, but they're only scapegoating GTA because it was in the spotlight before, and they just want to rile up the collection of Bible-thumping parents out there and say, ooh, look, there's titties and a money shot.
6045564	6050227	Ignore the fact that the game says the F word and nigger half the time.
6051047	6062132	Yeah, no, it's great, though, too, is, like I predicted, this is only the beginning, it's the whole nipple gate all over again, and as we'll be covering in our podcast later, they're coming after Sims 2's nude patch now.
6063233	6066614	Oh, yeah, you're saying that it's appealing to pedophiles.
6066634	6067635	There's a huge difference.
6067655	6071137	Hey, Newsflash, there are Ken dolls underneath those blurs.
6072817	6074218	There's a huge difference.
6075536	6078122	Not on the patch that I have!
6078402	6081469	There's a huge difference, too, between the Sims 2 thing and the Grand Theft Auto thing.
6081529	6086339	As I pointed out earlier, I believe the Grand Theft Auto thing to be a case of lazy programming.
6086676	6087817	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6108120	6109241	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6131440	6135581	That they break it down into second grade language for these people so that they understand.
6135881	6137422	And draw pictures if you have to.
6137742	6144104	To understand the difference between what happened with Grand Theft Auto San Andreas and people outright making the nude patches for other games.
6144324	6151787	I mean, God, within like five seconds of the Tomb Raider game being out, somebody had a patch so you could see Lara Croft's pussy.
6152047	6152647	I mean, that's just...
6153707	6169470	I still think that our society is so fucked up that where you can rip somebody's head off with the spine attached, dangling with blood dripping off of it, it's considered alright, but a money shot of man goo in the face of a woman on her knees is so taboo.
6169750	6181332	But, to put it into perspective though, the spinal cord attached to the head thing, and I assume you're referencing Mortal Kombat, I seem to recall that did have this whole theory of the attention with it.
6181992	6183354	That's why it wasn't in the Super Nintendo.
6183374	6184795	Basically what it's basically boiling down to is
6203777	6204578	DarkSakura.com
6242304	6244426	I'll bet you anything here's what happens about this.
6244506	6249552	Because parents are lazy and can't figure out how to do these things themselves, remember what they had to do for televisions?
6249612	6253216	That it's mandatory that the V-chip be installed in all television sets?
6253536	6259578	So that you can block programs above a certain rating if you want to.
6259859	6263380	So that way parents could still leave their kids unattended and the TV does the babysitting for them.
6263620	6267141	The only problem with that is the parents are half stupid about it.
6267161	6269402	They can't even work the VCR half the time.
6269422	6271523	The kids have already figured a way to hack around the VCR.
6272023	6273444	I'm not going to disagree with you there.
6274644	6281127	But I bet you anything, as a result of this, it's going to be required in these next-gen systems that they do some similar type of...
6281727	6282868	This is really crazy.
6283068	6284469	They already have that!
6284789	6286490	It's already in the PlayStation 2.
6287210	6288331	It's already on the PSP.
6288391	6289291	It's already on the Xbox.
6289312	6290512	They're pre-programmed in there.
6290732	6291193	But guess what?
6291453	6292273	Nobody knows about it.
6292313	6296035	Because they're not responsible parents.
6296556	6301919	Even if this game is adults only, kids are still going to be playing it because their dumbass parents go and buy it for them.
6302219	6303380	You know what I hope happens?
6304100	6304921	Here's what I hope happens.
6305181	6306502	The game gets rated adults only.
6307242	6308963	Fuck it, let's do whatever the fuck we want.
6309163	6314864	I want to have it where the main character goes and rapes babies and sends people on fire.
6315225	6315865	Fuck it, you know what?
6315945	6318406	I can do it now because it is an adults-only game.
6318926	6321486	So fuck you, can't say shit, adults-only.
6322007	6326048	You just make a game that says, fuck your children, this is adults-only.
6326708	6340736	I want to be able to ride around in a car that has a collective of child heads lined up on the front of the car for the grill, and I also have a rocket launcher that fires chickens butt-first out of it towards little old ladies that are carrying groceries.
6341036	6346500	And if you happen to knock one old lady into another, and her head gets stuck up her butt, you get a bonus score.
6348321	6348581	Wow.
6351329	6356893	Here's the problem though with the AO, you know, we're going to have this adults only orgy of games now.
6357354	6368702	The thing is, is that the targets, not really the targets, but they're part of it, the Walmarts of the world, the Best Buys of the world, the GameStops and... Oh, don't even get me started on stupid fucking Walmarts.
6369523	6375087	All these stores, all the big stores are going to pull, they're not going to have these games because they're the equivalent of porn.
6375387	6381813	So the only way you're ever going to find these AO games is in the back room of some video clearance center, rundown shack.
6381833	6383554	Hey, time for the mom and pops to come back.
6383594	6388539	You know what, if these big store chains don't want to carry the hot games out there, people will go other places and find them.
6389339	6390380	That's what the internet's for.
6391021	6392042	It's a wired world out there.
6392062	6392362	Exactly.
6392462	6393303	Fuck Walmart.
6393323	6393703	Who cares?
6393803	6395305	No one buys games anymore anyways.
6395325	6396366	They're always pirating them off the internet.
6396386	6398748	You can probably end up buying them out of vending machines in Japan.
6399625	6405710	Yes, I want to buy an adults-only game right next to being able to buy beer and sweaty girls' panties.
6409273	6410253	Shit, I'm out of beer.
6413636	6415978	Reznor, can't say we necessarily disagree with you.
6416058	6427707	You bring an interesting perspective to it, and I'll tell you what, you should be a game designer, because I think the Rabing Grandma game or whatever you had going on here was pretty hot, and I'd buy it.
6428231	6433598	Raping Grandma's 3, now with the new raccoon tail power-up.
6434139	6435381	It's the Grandma game.
6435401	6440007	Because you can fuck Grandma across the Oregon Trail.
6441509	6444533	You just wanted to work in the words Oregon Trail into this show, didn't you?
6445493	6446534	Actually, not really.
6446694	6452560	Someone has pointed out to me that the game that you're talking about sounds a lot like Death Race 2000.
6453961	6459666	Actually, yes, it does.
6459886	6464631	Can you imagine the grandma game, though, where they've got, you know, oh, here's grandma number one.
6464711	6465832	It's Maude.
6466873	6468695	Okay, Grandma Maude, answer this question.
6468715	6469856	You've got to flash your titties.
6471181	6475803	Whoa, whoa, okay, that's one instance I agree against porn.
6476503	6482206	You say Maude, and I think of Bea Arthur now, so that's scary, because she had that show.
6483526	6487107	And then you have the movie Airheads, it's like, I want naked pictures of Bea Arthur.
6487468	6488448	No you don't, no you don't.
6489709	6495751	Alright, all kidding aside, you bring up some good points, Reznor, and I hope America's listening.
6498030	6499071	Long live USA.
6500533	6502975	Any other final thoughts for us?
6503055	6504317	No, I'll save it for the FU.
6504617	6505157	Sounds good to me.
6505358	6506359	Thank you for being a friend.
6507239	6508441	Have a good one.
6508921	6509301	Bye.
6510002	6511644	You're the kind of listener we encourage.
6511664	6512565	One more call.
6512605	6514126	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
6520692	6521973	Loki for president, please.
6522193	6523715	I nominate Loki for president.
6523815	6524836	That was just awesome.
6525156	6525877	Oh, come on.
6525917	6527678	His ego doesn't need any more of that, please.
6528319	6529400	Hey, you can be vice president.
6529420	6530801	DarkSakura can be the first lady.
6532642	6534724	No, I'm the meat dictator.
6536226	6537327	I'm the Illuminati!
6537867	6543072	Jamie would be evil dictator of the country that would start World War III with Loki's country.
6543112	6544593	That's kind of how it would work, so...
6545410	6552236	Right now I want her and Hillary Clinton in a ring, three minutes, no polls barred, no TQ match.
6552356	6553196	That's what I want.
6553216	6555378	I'd be taking out the brass knucks and breaking her face.
6556359	6556859	Wow.
6557500	6560803	I'm glad this is uncensored radio because we could get in an AO right now.
6561123	6562304	Bitch, no you didn't.
6564005	6564926	Fuck that bullshit.
6564946	6565827	Just bring it on.
6569730	6571771	I was going to say, I was going to run that clip again.
6571811	6573713	Loki, what do you think about running for president?
6573793	6574474	Oh, it's so fun.
6575700	6577861	But I'm too lazy to queue up the clip again.
6579022	6580382	So what else is on your mind, my friend?
6581863	6587766	This is Ranchan, by the way, and a lot of crazy things have been happening to me the last couple of days, last two, three days.
6589567	6590967	Like what kinds of crazy things?
6591207	6594749	I didn't forget it.
6594789	6596550	I was going to make a sitcom reference or something.
6596570	6596870	Forget it.
6597931	6598851	What kinds of crazy things?
6600049	6603150	Let's say I order a package for a friend of mine for a birthday gift.
6603230	6605191	It shows up the day after the party.
6606991	6609672	My family just went into utter turmoil right now.
6609912	6610992	Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
6611933	6613553	Oh, you don't know.
6613693	6614973	I'll probably PM you that later.
6616234	6620255	On the good side, I just found out there's going to be an anime con in Sacramento this weekend.
6621215	6624916	I heard about some anime con that's going to be at the mall or something.
6624936	6625437	Oh, goody.
6625637	6626477	Not that one again.
6627188	6629550	I sent Jamie the information already.
6629730	6630151	You know what?
6630171	6632193	Remember the last time?
6632213	6636036	I have saw the email and then I got bombarded, so... Sorry.
6636757	6636997	It's okay.
6637017	6639960	Remember the last time we went to that thing?
6640560	6643503	I'm afraid of anime cons in a mall.
6645839	6646580	It was okay.
6646640	6649523	It was basically a bunch of vendors getting together to sell shit.
6649603	6650684	I mean, it was okay.
6650824	6652145	The typical Sunrise Fest.
6652185	6657590	The video room was the old McDonald's that is converted into like every store possible.
6657610	6659012	That was pretty funny, I have to admit.
6660032	6662294	Anime Cons of the Mall, I got you beat.
6662794	6667378	My anime cosplay club had like a little picnic in Central Park last weekend.
6668459	6672102	We came across another cosplaying group known as the Naruto Crack Crew.
6672522	6677346	They came in full Naruto cosplay gear and we're just staring at them.
6678467	6679568	Wow, that's awesome.
6680569	6684051	I mean, I wore my forehead protector and that was it.
6684472	6687314	I mean, no more Naruto cards, please.
6687554	6687974	God, no.
6689747	6690027	Wow.
6690328	6692810	Um... We might go check out the con.
6692870	6704261	My only problem is that I'm actually flying out to the East Coast on Sunday, which I think is the day that the majority of the con is taking place, so I don't know if I personally can go, but maybe my esteemed co-presenters can go.
6704461	6704822	Go where?
6705042	6705723	I'll think about it.
6706063	6706443	The, um...
6709035	6710715	Go hand out flyers for our show or something.
6710735	6711456	I'll go buy a pretzel.
6711956	6712916	Because I like their pretzel.
6712936	6713537	There you go.
6713657	6714137	There you go.
6714697	6716578	Get me a box of tofu.
6716678	6718399	Are you still meeting me when I come out to the East Coast?
6718899	6722040	Yes, a few of my friends are going to get together after the tournament.
6722080	6723401	We want to drag you off to a diner.
6724121	6724662	Sounds good to me.
6725382	6725582	Yeah.
6725899	6728560	All right, as long as I'm back at a decent hour, because I do have to work the next day.
6728600	6729681	But yes, I can do that.
6729701	6730441	It's the whole problem.
6730862	6731122	All right.
6731582	6733363	We'll keep the alcohol to a minimum, okay?
6733503	6735384	Sounds good to me, because I have a low tolerance.
6735884	6736144	All right.
6736304	6736645	Excellent.
6736785	6737945	Anything else you want to share with us today?
6739746	6742988	Can I get a request of Let's Groove, my tips and tricks, please?
6743368	6744709	I will try and work it in a little later.
6745549	6745829	Sweet.
6745849	6747290	Send me a private message so I don't forget.
6747950	6748211	I will.
6748351	6748651	All right.
6749471	6750112	Later, my friend.
6750552	6750972	Bye-bye.
6752515	6754978	Alright, good calls tonight, boys and girls.
6755098	6757861	We appreciate... We like our intelligent listeners.
6757901	6760564	This is what really motivates us to do what we do here.
6761525	6764508	Alright, and now something that takes no intelligence whatsoever.
6764548	6766270	It's the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match.
6768880	6772082	In tonight's cage match, three songs will do battle.
6772302	6773283	Whoops, where'd Hollick go?
6773483	6773824	There we go.
6774304	6776465	Three songs will do battle in tonight's cage match.
6776525	6779347	Last week's winner, you get a clip of it, two brand new songs.
6779888	6785652	Your votes in the chat room at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, clicking on chat, will determine the winner.
6785952	6790896	And the winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio Live, Milani Music and more programs.
6791604	6804628	Alright, first up we get last week's winner, last week in the Orange Lounge Cage Match, a very interesting spin on a 70s classic one, and it was kind of one of those moments where DarkSakura and I went, huh?
6805168	6814911	But you guys voted for it, you voted for Loki's pick of Ozzy Osbourne with Stayin' Alive, so it comes back as song number one this week, here's a clip, Ozzy Osbourne, Stayin' Alive.
6827509	6828210	Thank you for watching!
6847128	6848189	Stayin' Alive!
6848209	6848730	Stayin' Alive!
6873085	6888832	It's alright, it's okay, you may go the other way We can try to understand, but you don't have to think of me It's alright, it's okay, come and see another day We can try to understand, but you don't have to think of me Ha ha ha ha ha
6928383	6930826	All right, that was song number one in tonight's cage match.
6930986	6932928	Ozzy Osbourne was staying alive.
6932988	6934730	All right, song number two in tonight's cage match.
6934770	6936331	We're going to do my pick for song number two.
6937132	6938774	And I've decided to pick this group.
6938834	6942237	It's somebody I got turned on to by a friend who just saw them live recently.
6942598	6945360	And I went and downloaded some of their stuff on iTunes, and I really dug it.
6945400	6947162	So I wanted to share one of their songs with you guys.
6947182	6947743	Um...
6948243	6948584	Bjerg Bjorg
6961132	6963392	But it's actually pronounced Bjork, but everybody says Bjork.
6963653	6965953	And then there's what, Sigurjós and all those bands too?
6965973	6966513	Sigurjós.
6966633	6968173	Sigurjós or whatever, Figaro.
6968613	6973434	Oh my god, they should have like all the Icelandic bands do like one song together.
6973514	6974255	All three of them.
6974395	6978675	Not to make fun of Icelandic bands, because there's actually some pretty kickass music from Iceland.
6978856	6979656	It's just funny names.
6980216	6984357	So anyway, this band is Roisk... I think it's Roiskopp.
6985037	6985637	Roiskopp?
6986519	6993562	Roy Scopp, we'll say that, Roy Scopp, and the song is called Only This Moment, and it's song number two in tonight's cage match, enjoy.
7018871	7019513	Thanks for watching!
7114785	7115974	Thank you for watching!
7166414	7184346	All your things are just together, close to perfection Nothing else will always be right Trust in the light, stand on the side of the line, survive All your things are just together, close to perfection Nothing else will always be right Trust in the light, stand on the side
7229456	7231738	All right, that was song number two in tonight's cage match.
7231758	7234820	That was Roixop with Only This Moment.
7234920	7238644	Let's see if the other folks in the room liked it or didn't.
7239164	7239825	DarkSakura.
7240501	7245303	I liked it, but it was probably something I'd listen to if I was trying to go to sleep or like working on a picture or something.
7245923	7246944	It's very good, I would give it an 8.
7247784	7248104	Loki!
7248124	7249765	I actually kind of like that.
7250385	7251466	I would give it an 8 as well.
7252286	7252747	Jonas!
7253027	7253567	Exquisite!
7255608	7257209	I'll give it like an 8.5 on this one.
7257229	7263531	I actually like the tunes, kind of like, it reminds me back in the 8-bit days because of the tunes.
7264092	7265452	Yeah, that's kind of what I like about it too.
7265472	7266993	And it makes me feel relaxed and stuff.
7267876	7270059	I don't care if it has cultural relevance!
7283556	7284276	Shame, shame.
7284356	7285476	It's all good, don't worry.
7285856	7286337	Alright.
7287277	7289677	What song are you putting in the cage match tonight, DarkSakura?
7289817	7294238	It's a song we freaking should have had in rotation a long time ago, which I was afraid it already was.
7296298	7299419	We have a different version, like a different mix of it in rotation.
7299439	7300199	Like the crap version.
7300299	7301219	Yeah.
7301519	7303599	I am a big fan of the Best of Move series.
7303660	7304700	I always have been.
7306260	7308540	I can kick anybody's asses on this game.
7308840	7309421	Challenge me.
7309481	7310421	I swear I will own you.
7310821	7311781	I challenge you.
7312401	7313182	You know I'll own you.
7313602	7314663	I challenge you.
7314883	7315744	On-air duel.
7316224	7318706	On the first one, I used to have all the commands memorized.
7318947	7319647	I would play without them.
7319867	7320388	Wow.
7321068	7326973	On Busta... Well, for me it was Busta Groove, because I was raised on the US one.
7327914	7335541	That is what I played non-stop before DDR, so... I think we would probably have to do like... We would just get perfect scores all the time.
7336880	7339142	It would be a tough match, I'll put it that way.
7340183	7347970	Anyway, this is from the first one, it's Kitty N's theme song from the Japanese one, so it's the good version, and not the one trying to sound like the real McCoy.
7347990	7357738	I forgot who exactly was the singer on it, but it actually made top ten in the charts in Japan, from what I understand.
7358398	7363443	And it's a big Avex Tracks song, so it's I'll Show You No Knife.
7364554	7366784	Alright, here it is, song number three in tonight's cage match.
7396383	7397406	Thanks for watching!
7437845	7440007	Thank you for watching.
7440047	7442770	Please subscribe to my channel.
7497577	7499758	Thank you for watching.
7499859	7500879	See you next time.
7643499	7644640	DarkSakura, what you think?
7661888	7666833	Actually, it was pointed out to me that the file actually went wrong with the name.
7666913	7668335	It's Alzora.
7668935	7670256	Oh.
7671678	7674200	But, at any rate, yeah, I love that song.
7674280	7675441	I've loved that song forever.
7675601	7676442	It gets an 11.
7678564	7679085	Alright, Loki.
7679105	7681687	I don't know if it was an 11, but it was okay.
7681767	7682848	I mean, I'd give it a 7.
7684950	7686592	I mean, it sounds just like the original one to me.
7687760	7688901	It is the original one.
7688921	7690322	It sounds like the English one, okay?
7691543	7692444	No, it doesn't.
7692524	7693024	It doesn't matter.
7693425	7693825	It's okay.
7694025	7694946	It's just okay.
7696347	7696828	Jonas.
7698229	7704495	I don't see the big difference between the English version too much, except that the Japanese is a little better, but I'll say it's 8.
7704875	7705936	I like that song a lot.
7705976	7709619	I wish we had had that version of it in our Bust a Move, but we didn't.
7710970	7713232	But it's getting, it's kinda, I don't know, it's kinda old.
7713312	7716395	That's the only thing it has really going against it is that the song's kinda been out a while.
7716435	7717296	But it's still a good song.
7717996	7718997	I give it an 8 as well.
7719778	7724142	Alright, let's recap the three songs you kids can vote for tonight in the cage match.
7724202	7725763	And then you can place your votes.
7726264	7732169	So, let's start it off with song number one you can vote for tonight is Ozzy Osbourne with Stayin' Alive.
7738604	7743106	And song number two you can vote for tonight is Royce Skopp with Only This Moment.
7750930	7755372	And song number three you can vote for tonight is Avex with Pronounce This For Me, Jamie.
7757553	7757954	Thank you.
7765535	7768657	All right, place vote now.
7768757	7775481	Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote, and we'll tally them up and let you know who the wiener is.
7776522	7780985	Loki, this is usually the part of the show where I ask you what's going on in the sim scene as if you're paying any attention to it.
7781225	7782505	I am paying attention to it.
7782926	7784947	I check my cell every day.
7786428	7786788	Okay.
7787569	7790250	We already talked about tourney mix and how we don't care.
7791951	7794553	Yeah, last tourney mix in case you missed it last week.
7795520	7796661	is coming out pretty soon.
7797182	7799744	Get your files in if you really want to participate.
7800305	7804789	And then that's on ddrei.com.
7805450	7817761	And then, of course, the DDR OSC competition, the Psychopath Edition, which is all funny files, that was judged and I think is over with.
7817981	7819262	And nothing else going on.
7819483	7820143	What about the fun mix?
7820163	7820864	It's a fun event.
7821758	7823039	Are you retired from the sim scene?
7844298	7845879	You're not making your crazy-ass sim files?
7845899	7851802	There is a guy that actually posted a song file that said that he made it, I think it was a Max Remix, that said, by explicit.
7853363	7854343	What the hell?
7854363	7854683	Serious.
7855544	7856284	I don't make this up.
7858505	7869091	Interesting, I remember this before, someone sent, like, two of my sim files into B-Style, and I hammered it up too hard, so...
7870834	7893846	except we got some, well I can't say the word new, who's that someone else by the name Explicit Alpha, because I'm Explicit Gamma on the B- style, he said some guy named Explicit Alpha sent a file called Legend of Trance 2004, hell no, that's the same person, I just have various Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, I don't know what's next, that is all.
7896748	7897048	All right.
7897711	7909419	While I'm tallying up the cage match votes over here, DarkSakura, why don't you fill us in on some of the other lovely programming we have here on Orange Launch Radio, at least the one other show we have right now.
7909439	7909999	The one other show.
7910680	7914662	On Tuesdays, pre-show starting at a quarter to seven, show starting at 7.30.
7915002	7918144	That's Pacific time for everybody else.
7919065	7926530	We have Pump Up the Volume, which is a music request show in theory, although I pretty much just submit everybody to whatever I want to play for them.
7928140	7929101	It goes on to about 10.30.
7930221	7933764	And I'd like to catch everybody up on this week in Max Remixes.
7934944	7942109	Starting with Maximum, with three X's, by Mochi13.
7942189	7947733	We have Max 300, the MSG Remix by Fear of the Dragon.
7948213	7954557	Requiem for Max, Max 100, Max Takedown, Max Relord.
7955438	7956218	Why Relord?
7956238	7956798	What the hell?
7956818	7957699	That doesn't make any sense.
7958231	7971746	Relord, Max Cremation, Max Dominator, Zephyr, Max Speedmix, Max Francis, Max 300 Period, Max Hold.
7975170	7975450	Stop.
7976111	7977192	Just stop, people.
7980083	7981524	But there's one, though, I swear.
7981944	7986126	And I know it's one I downloaded just to check it out to see what it was.
7987966	7988967	Max Takedown.
7989907	7996590	And they say that the friend says, this is a version of Max that my friend Explicit made.
7996770	8000012	What the hell?
8000052	8000372	So, yeah.
8001112	8001572	Wow.
8001893	8002193	Told you.
8004434	8005574	Wow, just wow.
8005634	8007115	There's only one Explicit.
8009073	8009973	The Legend of Vertax
8029517	8034859	Because they try to fuse In The Groove and DDR together, so they come up with this.
8035239	8037800	Actually, I found this great new remix of Max recently.
8037860	8039361	It's a really good Max mix.
8039381	8043122	This is a good Max mix, huh?
8043142	8045663	Oh wait, I'm just kidding, that's Energizer from In The Groove 2.
8048344	8049524	That joke never gets old.
8050004	8050324	Alright.
8050344	8050925	Oh no.
8053752	8055893	Let's go to the cage match winner, shall we?
8056633	8057914	You want to know who won tonight's cage match?
8058254	8060015	You can't handle who won tonight's cage match!
8060175	8060736	Why not?
8061336	8064437	Alright, the winner in tonight's cage match, very, very close.
8064858	8066338	Very, very close battle tonight.
8066438	8072982	But, in the end, one song squeaked by to win it, and it's the song from Bust a Move.
8074923	8075883	Woohoo!
8076663	8081606	Who knew that there were so many fanboys and fangirls in there for Bust a Move?
8082535	8085199	Very, very close with the Roy Scup song, though.
8085319	8085880	Very, very close.
8086441	8091889	Which is unusual for my song to get that many votes, so... Damn you, DarkSakura.
8091929	8092610	Damn you to heck.
8092630	8093492	Whatever sounds better.
8094073	8094714	I know, it's alright.
8095174	8096016	I won't take it personally.
8100922	8101983	Let's go to a break, shall we?
8102023	8102723	I promised a break.
8103204	8106506	I unlocked the first picture in this wonderful game I'm playing.
8106526	8108367	Playing Gal's Panic!
8108407	8110248	No, I'm not playing Gal's Panic.
8110488	8112870	I'm playing Peekaboo Poker for the NES.
8113550	8114551	One of the few adult games.
8114571	8115712	Is that like Bubble Bath Babes?
8116112	8116853	Maybe by the same company.
8117213	8121176	Anyways, it says, Hi, I'm Full House Francine.
8121616	8123097	Are you feeling lucky tonight?
8123417	8124798	Want to fill up my house?
8126379	8128380	And this is like the worst graphics in the world.
8129181	8130742	This is what they need to be coming after.
8132028	8135630	These really sick games for the Nintendo Entertainment System.
8137432	8138112	Bad Nintendo.
8138933	8139253	Alright.
8140514	8142355	We're going to go to a break, you guys.
8142595	8145817	And this song here, we're going to start it off with a special dedication.
8145857	8149099	This is Let's Groove from DDR Max.
8149340	8152081	And Ron Chan wanted to hear this one, so we're dedicating it to him.
8152722	8153582	And here it is.
8153963	8154203	Enjoy.
8154223	8154323	Enjoy.
8212740	8213269	All right!
8425876	8426624	Thanks for watching!
8460290	8462651	Thanks for watching!
8533531	8534394	Thanks for watching!
8575262	8580924	Mr. Random Person on the Street, who, by the way, is not an actor, what do you think of the Orange Lounge mainlining music in Morse Show?
8581205	8588368	The music is like being transported to just this dancing spaceship place.
8588708	8588828	It's...
8590245	8590685	on Earthly.
8590925	8594647	It's like being in a club, except you don't have to actually ask someone to dance.
8614213	8615355	Jonas, that goes double for you.
8616217	8617259	You haven't been here in a while.
8617319	8618461	I know you've got some stored up.
8618601	8621466	Are you going to cut it up like they cut me up in the interview?
8621506	8624251	Yes, I will cut you up just like they cut up Loki's interview.
8624632	8625594	Remember, I cut myself up with
8627061	8627822	Alright, yeah, that's right.
8628142	8629783	Alright, moving on.
8630943	8637586	First, before we get to the FUs of the week though, Loki wanted me to talk about this because he's like, Rob, you have to talk about this story I posted, so fine.
8638086	8644009	DJ Maxx, it's this Korean online rhythm music game and it's going to be coming out for the PSP.
8644329	8645910	Tell us a little more about DJ Maxx, Loki.
8645930	8653973	DJ Maxx was by the creators of Easy to DJ, those who may not remember Easy to DJ, was the actual competitor for Beatmania out there.
8654677	8661081	It was 5 key with turntables, kind of set up like Beatmania 2DX where the turntables are on the outside.
8661501	8663583	Also had foot pedals on it, just like Beatmania 3.
8664803	8666464	So this game's coming out now.
8666544	8672328	DJ Max though, it's only 5 key, I believe it's only 5 key and no turntable.
8672448	8673289	No, actually I take that back.
8673309	8675230	7 key, no turntable.
8676150	8677891	But the songs are awesome.
8678012	8682254	They're by the same artists that were in Easy to DJ and the quality is just really good.
8682334	8683555	It's an online game right now.
8684025	8687986	But it is coming, well they have a cell phone version I guess, but this one's coming to the PSP.
8689146	8692427	Is it going to suck as much as like Beatmania on Gameboy?
8693768	8694388	I don't think so.
8694468	8700830	I think the way they can do it, because it's just five key presses, so I'm sure they can map it out in some way that'll make sense.
8702790	8706831	They should do the type of thing where you can turn it like on its side, so you can see the notes coming down better.
8706851	8709112	They did that on Wonderswan.
8709875	8712017	PSP Keyboard Version 2.0 Firmware Next Week
8732771	8737516	So, um... Is that the white PSP coming out at that same time, too?
8737977	8739238	White PSP's coming out in September.
8739318	8746687	It will be built in with firmware 2.0, so... Didn't you say you were going to buy two, just so you could have your old emulator PSP?
8747267	8750511	Yeah, I wanted to buy two just because of that, because I'm...
8750973	8758437	Curious to see, what I want to do is if the PSP looks like it can download files, and if it can download audio files, it can download our podcast.
8758718	8766062	If it can download our podcast, I'm going to make a PSP page where you can download the podcast on the format for the PSP and whatnot, special content, that type of thing.
8766822	8767222	Interesting.
8768523	8770264	So, but this looks really cool.
8770684	8778089	First, like, rhythm music game that I think is coming, well, unless you count Luminous, but that's not really a rhythm music game, it's more of a puzzle game.
8778369	8780070	But this is going to be coming out, um,
8780814	8781174	DarkSakura
8808584	8810065	This is all happening because of you.
8810125	8811426	This was all your idea.
8811746	8814548	Your big evil empire that you've built since episode one.
8814848	8817971	Why is it that we have to do these FUs of the week every single week?
8819712	8837104	My big, humongous FU goes for the... First FU to that microphone because it's fucking up again.
8837714	8839335	We're just gonna have to replace the damn thing.
8839355	8839916	Go ahead and try.
8840236	8842258	No, what about the one I bought?
8843419	8844460	We could always sub that in.
8844740	8844940	Yeah.
8844980	8845581	Yeah, we'll have a look.
8846702	8847502	It's right there behind you.
8848523	8849284	Is it plugged in?
8850145	8851746	No, I can just take the top off of it.
8852847	8854628	First off, he goes through technical difficulties.
8855169	8855749	Hold on a sec.
8861534	8862195	There we go.
8862395	8862895	Much better.
8864036	8865698	Bye bye, piece of shit microphone!
8867981	8869923	Anyway, F you to the microphone.
8870243	8871064	F you to work.
8872185	8877430	Specifically, and now keep in mind, I adore, you know, I adore my co-workers.
8877710	8878811	My boss is pretty cool.
8879612	8889881	But, just, a good manager should not let their stress bleed onto their employees, right?
8891482	8892203	That's been happening.
8893664	8921933	and I have been getting all stressed out at work and it's not good if I get all stressed out Thursday I went home sick with a combination of fatigue, low blood sugar and a pretty high level of stress ended up having a venti green tea frappuccino which I finished in twice the time Dan finished his and I still laid down at 9 o'clock and didn't wake up until 2 when he came home with his new car which is a model up for mine and brand new but my car still looks better I digress
8923715	8925816	That's really it, really it.
8926196	8927757	And also, oh yeah, F.U.
8927777	8929839	to how expensive the furniture we want is.
8930539	8930959	Okay, I'm done.
8931379	8934601	Alright, let's move on to Loki's F.U.s of the week.
8937483	8939244	Yeah, it's so fun.
8940364	8940945	The first F.U.
8940965	8942666	of the week goes to KCRA3.
8943046	8949189	Okay, now, I have to preface this with the fact Brian, the interviewer, he was great.
8949390	8951731	Okay, the reporter was awesome, the cameraman was awesome.
8952762	8956505	Just whoever edited the damn thing, not awesome, okay?
8956645	8960908	They really need to learn we're better than heat, okay?
8961148	8972497	So, no plug, they fucking suck for that, and the fact that they cut this, like, really stupid clip of me talking and saying, it's so fun, you know, don't even put me in it at all, okay?
8972537	8974619	Because at least I don't look like a fucking idiot.
8975039	8975940	Thank you very much.
8977230	8981231	I'm definitely going to have some written contract for the next person that interviews us.
8981791	8983851	There's going to be some serious issues.
8984551	8984891	Anyways.
8986092	8986992	So fuck you to that.
8987732	8990832	Fuck you to stupid people that are driving too damn slow.
8990892	8992473	Especially people from Arizona.
8992933	8997934	Like this woman today, uh... It was like... I don't even remember what it was.
8997994	9004495	It was like... Like... Old... Old... Toot or something like that is what the license plate said.
9004515	9005175	It was just like...
9005822	9012667	No, old fart or something, old toot, you know, I'm like... Okay, so I think it was actually this old guy.
9013007	9016249	When we drove by him, the guy looked like he was a corpse driving the car.
9016790	9020212	Like, head is back like... Driving the car.
9020732	9021313	Really hilarious.
9021786	9022607	This is what you do.
9022627	9023607	You tell them it's a health hazard.
9023627	9024268	They'll be on it fast.
9047423	9048383	No, they're just retarded.
9048403	9054165	They're replacing the whole unit and they fucked something up so they have to, you know, come out Monday first thing and fix it.
9055146	9061808	Apparently this wasn't the first apartment that they did that to because they were telling me that, oh yeah, we replaced the whole unit and it's defective already.
9062348	9066150	So we had to sit there for messing around with it and figure out what was wrong.
9066170	9071812	So fuck you to that and fuck you to my mom's stupid dog for keeping me up every night because she wanted attention at three in the morning.
9072772	9073092	That's it.
9075513	9075793	My turn.
9082799	9086242	I'd like to give an F you to 12-hour workdays like the one I had on Friday.
9086562	9096149	That kind of sucked because I came home and I napped for a long time and then I ended up staying up until like 4 in the morning because my sleep schedule was just all screwed up.
9096909	9098810	But don't get me wrong, I love my job.
9098971	9100331	I could do without the 12-hour workdays.
9100612	9104414	If I could do my job 8 hours evenly every day, I'd be fine.
9105175	9105295	So...
9106212	9107493	Oh well, I guess it comes with the territory.
9108213	9113036	An F you to the fact that I have to travel soon because I'm going to miss being here for two weeks.
9114817	9120940	It makes it hard to do a podcast every single week when I'm not going to be here and trying to do a three hour show as well.
9121120	9122141	I'd like to be here for that.
9122661	9130605	So, a general angst to leaving and then going to an area that's going to be, you know, it's not like I'm going to Disneyland, people.
9132046	9134087	So, oh well, it comes with the territory.
9134968	9135328	And then, um,
9137199	9144683	An F you to the fact that when I tried to play 2DX 6 style and 3rd style earlier this week, they wouldn't work with my component cables for some reason.
9144703	9146984	I can't figure out if that's a resolution thing or what the hell is going on.
9147324	9151045	So F you to me being a technological idiot when it comes to the new TV.
9151446	9153827	But otherwise, I love my new TV.
9153867	9155067	It's so pretty.
9155428	9157428	Oh, and F you to how bad I suck at Halo 2.
9158109	9158389	That's all.
9159488	9164732	Moving on to the one and only Explicit Alright, I'll keep it quick in quick summaries, alright?
9165492	9187728	FU to the whole adults only for GTA Like everybody already mentioned it a while ago And the fact that the ESRP is gonna kill sales for all those M or AO games Look what you did And FU goes to the neighbors for blaming us for killing their plants over water issues First of all, we didn't spill any water
9188584	9190525	or leak any water out of nowhere.
9191126	9194107	Second of all, is it even our house that was leaking water?
9195728	9200972	And after it goes to the spot being broken still, I still need to get a hot tub massage.
9202733	9208516	And after it goes to my tail bump being all fucked up, I gotta go check on the doctor for that one.
9209577	9212099	And after it goes to Manfei on Anime Expo.
9213652	9215113	Oh my god, Manfei is back?
9215714	9216815	Yes, he is back.
9217756	9221620	I saw Manfei at, uh, at Faname a few years ago.
9223281	9226204	A guy who cosplays as Fei, and he's really hairy.
9227846	9232750	And I don't mean hairy as in scary, although Yae is scary, but I mean hairy as in covered in fur like a bear.
9234132	9238276	Surprisingly he got arre- well, he didn't get arrested, but he's banned from Anime Expo, but he's-
9239252	9243695	almost mooned and stuck his ass up with my friend who tried to tag on his shoe.
9243715	9252900	I have only, sorry, I've only ever once seen good crossplay as in a guy crossplaying a girl.
9253761	9257503	And that was a really pretty, pretty guy crossplaying Utena.
9258184	9258724	From the movie.
9259665	9260625	A pretty guy.
9261025	9262046	A really pretty guy.
9263467	9265368	Alright, what was I going to say?
9265388	9266069	Effie goes to...
9267757	9271880	This one lady that hit me during the time I was in L.A.
9272981	9277384	She rear-ended me and even though there was no damage, she hit and run and blamed it was my fault.
9278085	9281767	How is it my fault when you drove 15 miles an hour on the goddamn drive-thru?
9283508	9284489	I don't understand that.
9285590	9290814	You drive 15 miles an hour on a drive-thru and you accuse someone because they stopped.
9292875	9293736	Who's to blame here?
9296483	9297104	Uh, let's see.
9297224	9302089	An FB to... Sir, stupid little kid just stepped on my foot!
9303290	9304551	It might be really this big.
9304571	9310177	And... I'm not gonna make a comment.
9312279	9315342	And because I want to make sure I don't get cut off, I'll say doopie continue.
9315362	9316142	Wait, actually, one more.
9316162	9316583	There's one more.
9317878	9323502	And a big if it goes to the whole tournament drama that was leading to the pit tournament.
9323962	9327204	Oh yeah, they wanted to ban some guy, that didn't make me happy.
9327604	9333428	Yeah, even though I cleared it out in a bad way, it damaged my reputation in a way.
9333468	9336330	Well not you, don't take it personally, it's not you, it's the other guy.
9336670	9339252	He needs to go out, he needs to be publicly spanked.
9340953	9341693	He might like that though.
9341713	9344195	I wonder what's going to happen in the tournament, that's all I want to know.
9344375	9344655	Yeah.
9346239	9348782	You know I gotta back Toadie up, no matter what happens.
9348902	9352626	I know the band decision was uncalled for.
9352826	9356991	That's why I cleared everything up to make sure, in a peaceful manner, drama.
9357191	9358613	Alright, it's cool.
9358653	9359133	It'll be cool.
9359333	9361856	Alright, let's move on to the chatroom FU, shall we?
9362377	9366181	And somebody said that this song is so horrid that I had to use this as the background music.
9367613	9374939	Let's see, Misty wants to say an FU to the USB reader on the Indigroove 2, not responding to my card or any other card that was tried.
9375280	9377862	Hope it's a problem that can be fixed with just a reboot.
9378462	9383706	Socorina says, FU to the retard who let my 9-year-old brother play Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.
9385388	9392934	Acer800 says, FU to the AC not working for a month, and my mom getting mad at me for listening to the FUs last week.
9393775	9395215	It's not a children's program.
9395515	9396476	Not saying you're a child.
9396596	9397396	Adults only.
9398196	9402057	Buy headphones, okay, if you're gonna listen to our naughty language.
9404438	9411560	Also, we have Reznor says a nice fuck you to cum shots being more risque than shooting someone in the ass with a hand cannon.
9414540	9420002	Sakura Sin says F you to Nintendo for not making any good puzzle games lately to keep me busy.
9421004	9422185	Hello, did you play Meteos?
9422365	9425147	Well, I realize Nintendo didn't make that, but Meteos is very cool.
9425247	9426108	I've got to recommend that.
9427028	9430551	Illusion says, F you to cutting my gums a few minutes ago, and now they're bleeding.
9432212	9435354	And Ron Chan says, F you to the post office.
9436034	9438796	It was supposed to come Friday, but it came Saturday, and I had left.
9438876	9439377	Fuck you.
9439797	9442359	Oh, and F you to me running out of space on my hard drive.
9444640	9447382	That's it for our angsty chatroom F yous.
9447502	9448123	Yay.
9448243	9448563	All right.
9450667	9455189	No, it was kind of light on the angst tonight.
9455789	9456529	It was angst light.
9456569	9457770	Diet angst tonight.
9457850	9458310	That's all right.
9459530	9464873	Okay, what we're going to do now, I think we're going to go ahead and go to another break.
9468786	9470007	We'll make this a quick break.
9470647	9474909	Someone wanted to hear... There were some songs that folks wanted to hear and I already forgot what some of them were.
9475129	9476570	I think someone wanted to hear System Romance.
9476670	9481052	So I'm going to get to System Romance and I'll get into another song that somebody else wanted to hear.
9482853	9483093	What?
9484954	9485594	Last Message.
9486275	9487075	You want to hear Last Message?
9487095	9487835	Fine, we'll get to Last Message.
9487855	9492598	We're going to make this a short break because we're looking for questions for Ask Orange Lounge.
9492618	9497240	That's right, it's time to Ask Orange Lounge or tonight you can ask Jonas as well if you want to.
9498059	9499840	What the hell is that metal that you're wearing around your neck?
9499880	9500501	That's what I want to know.
9501121	9502302	John Cena's a spinner.
9502442	9503122	It's a spinner?
9503883	9505884	This is what I got from the WWE event.
9505924	9507285	It's the spinner from John Cena.
9508886	9510206	Hey, you can't see me.
9511067	9511807	Obfuscate.
9512788	9521233	For anyone who's ever played live action Vampire, his little waving his hand in front of his face thing is also the obfuscate action for live action Vampire.
9521393	9521813	Oh, wow.
9522113	9523174	So, you can't see me.
9523594	9524375	Okay.
9525174	9526255	Oh, that was the other request.
9526295	9527837	Somebody wanted to hear something from Silent Hills.
9527877	9529578	So how about instead we hear some You're Not Here.
9530279	9531380	Is that acceptable, DarkSakura?
9532561	9533122	Um, okay.
9534002	9534203	Okay.
9535424	9536044	You gonna be okay?
9536545	9537746	Okay!
9538487	9539428	Alright, so we'll get to that.
9539788	9541950	We'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.
9686198	9690119	It's got to be forever, the raindrops blowing, the wind is dancing
9710294	9720902	It would be a much better sight with you with me If you hadn't met me, I'd be fine on my own, baby Never felt so lonely when you came along
9729368	9732189	So now what should I do?
9732410	9747716	I'm strung out, addicted to you My body aches now that you're gone My sublime fell through You let me give me everything you had and more You craved my happiness when you made me feel joy in me Just smile for now
9757219	9760760	Oh hi, dead air because I forgot to put in a promo there.
9760780	9761200	We're back!
9787352	9790174	Listen to Orange Lounge Radio or we eat your liver!
9819952	9822913	Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid questions.
9823374	9826695	What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?
9827335	9828596	What will the chatroom ask?
9828916	9830497	Will it be a G-rated question?
9830837	9833958	I really hope so, because this show's already too much A-O.
9846760	9855426	Let's see, Tomokun wants to know, why was 180 mode pissed away on Parapara dancing and not in Parapara Paradise?
9857127	9861069	I'm assuming that's when you can turn around and do Parapara the other way?
9861270	9863451	Like, so people can actually watch you doing the dancing?
9864152	9866713	I didn't play enough Parapara to follow that stuff, I have to admit.
9867034	9871256	You know, I thought it was cute for like a week, but... Do you know anything about that?
9871617	9871737	No.
9872898	9873298	I don't know!
9874233	9877614	You know, sometimes they just take modes out.
9877894	9881155	But if you look up, aren't there only sensors on the front part of it?
9881195	9883656	Don't they not have sensors on the back part of a Parapar machine?
9884396	9884897	I don't remember.
9885597	9887597	No, they don't, but you could probably put one there.
9887617	9888278	You can mount it.
9888518	9892179	I guess you could flip it around if you wanted to, but... No.
9893299	9893579	Oh, well.
9894280	9896540	Sorry, don't know enough about Parapar to answer your question.
9896580	9899541	Boy, do we suck or what.
9899581	9900062	Moving on.
9900082	9900122	Um...
9903382	9907284	You know, this question is pretty much setting us up to drop the clip again.
9907324	9908024	You know that, right?
9908044	9914667	Illusion basically wanted to know, what does Loki think of sex with children?
9915007	9917628	It's great that... Free for the producers.
9917968	9919589	Free speech for everyone.
9920089	9921130	It's so much fun.
9921390	9921930	There you go.
9921950	9923130	Shut up!
9923150	9923411	Wow, yeah.
9923451	9925191	Way to go, Rob.
9934158	9934578	Bird!
9936520	9937240	Give me that, then!
9937761	9940963	Misty says, what song was playing during Explicits FUs?
9941023	9943986	I think I recognized it, but I'm not sure because I hardly heard it.
9944366	9949990	The song that was playing during Explicits FUs was EVO 66 from 2DX Red.
9950010	9958777	That's what song we had.
9959058	9959738	This is the worst part.
9959758	9960419	There we go, here we go.
9962503	9965545	That was the song I was playing, Wall 5, 2DX Red.
9966446	9967867	I thought it was an appropriate F.U.
9967887	9968127	song.
9968307	9971369	I didn't even know there was a background when I was listening to F.U.s.
9972768	9978472	Alright, RainbowsInTheNight wants to know, how can I fix my metal dance pad from Red Octane?
9978853	9981755	Half of the up arrow works and the back arrow doesn't work at all.
9981855	9984637	Red Octane was all like, take it to a TV repairman.
9985017	9986278	Problem being, I'm broke.
9986598	9987379	Any suggestions?
9987519	9989020	I've already disassembled and cleaned it.
9989120	9989821	Same problems.
9990121	9994384	The closest DDR machine is 40 minutes away on an interstate because Virginia's pretty lame.
9994704	9995585	Help would be nice.
9995985	9997727	Well, Loki, you built your own metal pads before.
9997767	9998267	What do you think?
9998307	9999328	TV repair, man.
9999348	9999908	What the hell?
9999928	10000809	It's not a TV.
10000909	10001510	That's kind of weird.
10001530	10002230	Send it back to them.
10002250	10003331	It's their own fucking pad.
10003351	10004092	They should fix it.
10004272	10004672	I don't know.
10005493	10008175	Well, now, how do the sensors work in a metal pad?
10008195	10008895	At least you can explain this.
10008915	10010016	Well, a metal pad depends.
10010197	10018643	Most likely, it's just going to be contacts in there, and if half the up arrow works or whatever, probably half the contacts or something broke or something or fell off.
10018964	10020605	I haven't really looked at their metal pads.
10020725	10024408	I've taken apart crappy metal pads, and that's the way they work, but...
10025540	10027421	How long has he had it?
10027661	10028481	Well, we don't know.
10028841	10030021	I can ask how long he's had it.
10030041	10035163	I would ask, I mean, honestly, if you buy it from Red Octane, isn't there some sort of return policy or something?
10035183	10038504	Yeah, you've got to assume it's past the return policy time, though, if he's asking this.
10038604	10041705	Oh, he says, out of warranty and yes, contacts.
10042605	10048047	So, my first suggestion would be clean the contacts, and he says he's disassembled and cleaned it.
10048107	10051888	So, does that just mean one of his contacts is broken and he's shit out of luck, or what?
10051908	10053008	It's not necessarily contacts.
10053048	10054789	It'd be a loose wire or something, also.
10055453	10056734	Hmm, that's a good thought too.
10058255	10058675	What, Jonas?
10058735	10059395	Give him a mic.
10060476	10066019	Usually if you clean up the whole thing, usually it's not that case, because I've seen vendors actually try fixing this.
10066719	10070802	You have to check if one of the wires is burnt or anything like that.
10072423	10074884	So in what case is he absolutely screwed?
10074944	10077946	How would this guy know if he's just screwed and he shouldn't even bother wasting his time?
10078737	10081980	Because the shit could have just broke, and that's sad.
10082520	10088805	I can't answer that question unless he tells you how long he has it, how many... Yeah, he says Christmas, he says.
10089566	10092088	And how many times has he been playing the game, like how many songs?
10092108	10096191	Well, you can assume if there's no DDR machine nearby, it's probably quite a bit.
10097279	10100482	All I can say is that they don't last that long.
10100762	10108289	I guess the best answer we can come up with is that it sounds like you already kind of have an idea how to fix this thing because you've opened it up and you've cleaned it.
10108609	10117938	There's probably not a whole lot else we could tell you except take a look at the wiring and make sure you don't have any loose connections going from the contacts to the actual, like,
10119908	10122570	What do they call it where it all comes together towards the top?
10122610	10122891	Whatever.
10123631	10134860	Check your wiring, but if a wire has shorted or burned out, there's really not a whole lot short of replacing the wire that you're going to be able to do, which is something you probably don't want to try doing yourself.
10135940	10137822	Yeah, you don't want to waste too much time on it.
10137842	10140924	Usually it's just to get a new pad because it's basically worn out.
10140984	10142585	Wait, what games have you been playing, though?
10142605	10144227	Well, assuming it's DDR, some...
10145563	10148686	I mean, like, there's DDR and In The Groove as well, that uses the same pads.
10148746	10149707	Well, but it wouldn't matter.
10149727	10151729	Yeah, I can understand if In The Groove ruined those pads.
10151749	10152049	Stop it.
10152089	10152970	It's such a horrible game.
10153050	10154151	It's like, I can't take it!
10154171	10154492	Stop it.
10155773	10162439	He says he plays every day about three to four hours a day on heavy mode, so I think you've probably just beat that pad to death.
10163040	10165663	The sad thing is, those red octane pads don't last forever.
10165963	10170067	Well, I mean, honestly, if it's just, like, a metal pad or something...
10170745	10171565	The contact's in it.
10171605	10174186	I'm sure there's ways that you can mod them and upgrade them.
10174206	10179827	There's a whole thread on DDR Freak about modding, fixing, doing stuff to your metal pads.
10180087	10180807	Just go there.
10181167	10181788	Take a look there.
10181908	10182668	Ask your question there.
10182708	10184388	See if they can't help you over on the Freak.
10184928	10189609	Otherwise, make Red Octane give you a better answer because that's a shitty answer they gave you.
10189689	10193910	So you should email them again and tell them the people on the radio said that they gave you a shitty answer.
10194491	10195351	Get that person fired.
10196251	10197231	They can't say that, really.
10198412	10199972	That's the best thing that we can give you guys.
10200012	10200252	Sorry.
10201178	10207004	Acer 800 wants to know, who would win in an actual cage match?
10207144	10209486	Loki, DarkSakura, or me, Sky?
10210968	10211448	Good question.
10211468	10214151	DarkSakura, who would win in an actual cage match between the three of us?
10214471	10214772	I would.
10214972	10215252	Why?
10216173	10221859	Because I exercise regularly, lift weights, and I've taken karate.
10222900	10224041	I've got that killing urge.
10226001	10228102	Yeah, but that's when you need to be sloppy and make mistakes.
10228403	10230444	I've got a lot of smarts up here.
10230624	10236548	I could... I'd make you... See, I would make Loki and DarkSakura beat up on each other while I just kind of watch.
10236908	10237188	No.
10237248	10238549	And then that way I save my strength.
10238589	10240390	I'd use you as a bludgeoning tool.
10241531	10242352	We'll see about that one.
10243634	10251644	Honestly, Acer 800, we would not know the answer to that one unless we actually tried it, which maybe we'll do one of these days.
10253065	10253846	As a rating stunt.
10258951	10267353	Reznor wants to know, what's the status on the old school show?
10267793	10271334	The old school show was supposed to launch a couple weeks ago, and I'm really sorry it hasn't happened yet.
10271794	10277236	A decision was made on the staff that we want to make it not just 8-bit music, but 16-bit music as well.
10277576	10282957	And I've just been so freaking busy that I haven't had the time to update the 16-bit music as well.
10283517	10285838	So I'm going to try and get on that this week, because...
10289073	10290373	I'll keep you posted on that.
10290533	10292714	I definitely want it to happen before summer's over.
10293174	10297136	Hopefully before August gets here, so I will work just for you on the 16-bit stuff this week.
10297676	10297916	Okay?
10298936	10299256	Promise.
10300757	10301297	Alright, moving on.
10303376	10307057	Socorino wants to know, can you make an mp3 of that Ask Orange Lounge song?
10307497	10313298	Actually, it's a song called Journey to the Wonderland by NPB, and it's in Keyboard Mania 2.
10313999	10323381	If you want a clip of me actually singing it... Hey, I still have Bumblebee disguised voice mix.
10324521	10325981	Oh my god, that's old.
10326382	10328082	I think I played it like a couple weeks ago.
10328732	10329993	That's very, very old.
10330433	10331954	You actually played it on your show?
10332974	10333735	Several times.
10333895	10334255	Bitch.
10338317	10342480	And Sakurina also wants to know if we could play the actual Silent Hill because I fucked up last break.
10342500	10347643	He wanted to hear the actual song Silent Hill and not a song from Silent Hill.
10348043	10348683	So my bad.
10349204	10351605	We're running out of time on the show, so here's a clip.
10352405	10354887	I wish we could live
10359105	10360146	Alright, that's all you get, sorry.
10361126	10361967	We're running short on time.
10365528	10367569	Tomokun wanted to make a point, just to follow up.
10367649	10370671	Yes, Parapara Dancer did have sensors on the back as well.
10370991	10378495	Well, that's why Parapara Paradise didn't have the 180 mode, because they didn't have sensors on the back.
10378855	10381176	Probably a cost-cutting thing, honestly.
10381296	10382397	That's my best answer.
10385231	10391572	Neo Dude wants to know, what do you guys think about the Konami Red Octane Rocksaur Madcatz lawsuit?
10391592	10393953	Didn't we talk about that a few weeks ago?
10393973	10396353	We kind of did talk about it a few weeks ago on the show.
10396393	10399174	I'm going to assume that we've got a new listener on our hands, which is cool.
10399474	10400414	Hi, welcome to the show.
10400474	10400934	Hope you enjoy.
10402615	10407796	But there have been, you know, a few recent developments, and you know, the chat can sometimes sway your mind.
10408096	10409096	What do you think, Loki?
10409136	10410616	What's your latest perspective on this?
10410736	10411996	Although I already know what you're going to say.
10412777	10414377	My latest perspective on this is,
10414810	10423573	You know, Konami's within their rights, you know, to do this because, you know, these companies are making, you know, crappy games and, um, well, not necessarily crappy games.
10424113	10427574	They're making games that obviously are too much like DDR.
10427714	10431955	I mean, they're just trying to, like, kind of get people like, oh, hey, you like DDR?
10431975	10434976	Then you'll like this almost like DDR game.
10435957	10442018	And, um, you know, when it comes down to it, it's just an inferior product, just like those Apple products.
10442238	10442659	And, um...
10444622	10453073	You know that they were having a huge debate in the chat room before this started and it simmered down and I was hoping they would shut up already about the Apple vs. PC thing.
10453393	10457399	But no, you had to go in over your big fat mouth and bring up the Apple thing again.
10457419	10459081	This is because you don't know how to use it.
10459141	10459742	Exactly.
10459902	10460463	Oh, that's right.
10461124	10461304	On!
10461344	10462545	Where's your on button?
10463146	10464288	How do I upgrade this thing?
10464368	10464768	Oh, that's right.
10464788	10465530	It's all built together.
10465610	10466992	Stop it.
10467312	10467633	Stop it.
10467733	10468894	I've upgraded Max before.
10469075	10474402	Somebody wanted me to point out that there is a... Now I don't have the exact thing, but I'm sure somebody will...
10475645	10491523	I have opened up Macs before and changed out their memory, changed out the hard drives, put in new graphics cards.
10491763	10494386	Yeah, you can upgrade a Mac the same way you can a PC.
10495147	10496789	No matter what you do, they're still inferior.
10498386	10499547	and you're talking out of your ass.
10499567	10501448	Can't we just all get along?
10501548	10506751	Isn't there room for... As soon as he stops talking out of his ass and actually talks about something he knows about, maybe.
10507051	10517118	Wait, now that we're on the contrary with Konami, Rockstar, and Red Octane Madcast, what would happen with this Neon FM game since... It's nothing like DDR.
10517198	10517618	That's why.
10518878	10523282	I'll tell you what's... That's the only thing I'm thinking about since, you know, like the Konami thing.
10523462	10524623	Here's my perspective with it.
10524663	10528667	As long as Neon FM doesn't try to invade the home markets, they'll be fine.
10528767	10531970	No, I think they're going to be fine anyways because they've been working with actually Konami on this.
10532010	10535173	They've actually flown the people in or whatever and had them look at the game.
10535433	10538435	Hopefully though, hopefully though, they're not just feeding us BS with that.
10538755	10545220	Because the In The Groove team said, shut up, we know it's legal, and now here you go.
10545540	10558890	But honestly, looking at the gameplay of this game, it is quite different from, I mean, the setup of the pads are different, the gameplay looks different, it's got just really different stuff in it, so I don't think they're going to be really in
10559626	10565350	Fringing Out, whereas In The Groove looks like DDR just with different shaped arrows.
10565491	10567452	I mean, it's pretty much the same damn game.
10567532	10573556	And honestly, the Mad Catz game was just a shitty game in general and brought everybody down, so it just needed a spanking, basically.
10574877	10580602	That's the only question I have with what happened to Neon FM, because everyone's saying, ooh, it's Beatmania on feet.
10581482	10585225	But then again, I think as long as they aren't
10587089	10596318	I think as long as it's different enough from DDR with the foot layout and everything in there, in-game layout appears to be very different, I think they'll be okay, just like Pump It Up's okay.
10596338	10598961	But of course you have that whole lawsuit thing, but whatever.
10599061	10608851	Anyway, long story short, what I believe, what's going on with this lawsuit, In The Groove should have never tried to come out for the home systems because it awoke the Konami sleeping giant, and that's what's happening now.
10609929	10611992	What anime slash video game character would you all cosplay and why?
10625652	10627913	DarkSakura, you actually do cosplay, so I should start with you.
10627933	10630014	I've never actually cosplayed a character from Anonymy.
10631275	10632935	I've cosplayed a character from a manga.
10633856	10636137	I went as Mad Hatter from Sanctuary.
10638698	10646241	I've also cosplayed Baiken from Guilty Gear X. Dan didn't like that because I didn't have anything to hold my boobs up.
10649062	10651543	I've cosplayed Jill from Resident Evil.
10653574	10669827	I've, I actually still have that costume, I've cosplayed Emi, uh, as in 3rd Mix DDR, uh, who else have I done, oh yeah, Shorty from Bustin' Move 2, um, I really don't know, and I've been trying to think of who I would, um, Leona from,
10670647	10688027	I've done Leona The costume is actually three sizes too big for me now Take that back, four sizes too big for me now So it's officially retired I was working on doing Richter Belmont from Dracula X
10690352	10696895	I want to do one from an anime, I just don't know who, although it's been suggested to do Hyatt from Exosaga.
10697955	10702497	But I don't want to do that outfit, and I don't want to carry around fake blood and cough.
10703277	10705998	I went as Ash Ketchum one year for Halloween, does that count?
10707779	10708439	I hate that name.
10708499	10709440	I love Pokemon.
10710180	10711340	You're watching the American Craft.
10711360	10713101	Speaking of that, I am watching the American Craft.
10713121	10716502	I've seen a shitload of Pokemon trainers up in Anime Expo.
10716522	10720704	Alright, somebody start a thread on the Orange Lunch forums that should I cosplay.
10721024	10722244	Loki, what would you cosplay as?
10722484	10723545	Gendo the Uber Pimp.
10725706	10726026	Alright.
10726086	10729247	Let's see, I'll probably cosplay as Bronco for next year.
10729407	10731608	I am not cosplaying as Noodle, thank you.
10731628	10733988	I don't know, that would be fun.
10734008	10738010	Oh yeah, we get some body paint and do something for the masquerade for Anime Expo.
10740419	10741459	Oh, no.
10741480	10742000	Oh, God.
10742240	10744301	Well, we have another really good question from the chat room.
10744361	10748042	Illusion wants to know, what does Loki think about do-it-yourself abortion kits?
10748542	10749223	It's so much fun.
10749423	10749983	It's great.
10754204	10755285	It'll never get old, Loki.
10756645	10757866	Yeah, but you've got to clip it out.
10759427	10763668	And Tomokun would like to point out, Loki, a Power Mac, it's like a PC.
10763748	10765409	They are 100% upgradable.
10767190	10768210	From shit to crap.
10769258	10769879	Stop it!
10769959	10771280	You are... You know what?
10771420	10775144	For your birthday, I'm buying you a gift certificate to the Apple Store.
10775384	10776906	And I will set it on fire.
10776926	10778047	You could just suffer.
10778928	10780129	You will have to find something you like.
10780169	10786335	I will buy... If you give me enough money to buy an iPod, I will buy enough... Buy an iPod, and I will take a sledgehammer to it.
10786555	10788157	I... And then I will sell it.
10788177	10789198	You're just a bastard.
10790259	10791160	I love my iPod.
10791220	10792161	It's like the best thing ever.
10793851	10802418	They said, I am a little upset because my roommate just bought an iPod and he paid the same price for his that I paid for mine, but because he bought his six months later, he got a color one.
10803399	10805201	Bastard.
10805841	10808083	Anyway, that's going to do it for Ask Orange Lounge.
10808103	10810365	Thank you guys for submitting your questions.
10811246	10812207	And now, it's 9.30.
10812327	10813648	It's time to end the show.
10815329	10816170	Final thought time.
10817291	10818472	Explicit, your final thought.
10819690	10822311	Well, it's nice to meet you guys again.
10823051	10824091	Just like the good old times.
10824151	10825511	I'm glad you found the new house okay.
10825751	10832813	Yeah, that too, and I finally got a chance to come over here to introduce the tournament, finally, since I've been so busy.
10834493	10837634	Yeah, there's a tournament that's in July 30th, this Saturday.
10837654	10845536	DDRPA and Freestyle, and it is a possibility that newspaper journalists will come in for, like, Sacramento Bee.
10846423	10848284	And don't forget, there's Lumpia and Ice Cream.
10848364	10849565	And you might get your foot in the paper.
10849585	10850245	Mmm, Lumpia.
10850385	10851366	Mmm, Lumpia, I agree.
10851686	10852847	Say again, what about my foot?
10853347	10854928	You might get your foot in the paper, just like Loki did.
10856388	10859290	If Sac B comes out, because you know Loki's foot was in the Sac B, playing DDR.
10859910	10860391	Oh, wow.
10860871	10861851	Have fun at the tournament.
10861931	10864533	That'll be at Paradise Island in Sacramento, California.
10864733	10865353	Yes, indeed.
10866114	10867454	In addition to a Super Smash Bros.
10867495	10869015	meetup for those who are interested in that.
10869376	10871817	I'll just do, you know my strategy at Super Smash Bros.
10871877	10872937	is to just play as Ness.
10873178	10873918	PK Fire!
10874058	10874778	PK Fire!
10874899	10875579	PK Fire!
10876724	10877104	Loki!

10905278	10907199	And I ate the two barbecue sauce packets.
10907739	10907859	Ew.

10911141	10916464	Loki, I hope you go home and find all your computers that were replaced with Macs.
