4
00:00:19,642 --> 00:00:25,804
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, everybody, and welcome to another week of the Orange Lounge Radio to-go edition.

5
00:00:25,844 --> 00:00:29,386
[SPEAKER_03]: This, by the way, if I've done my math right, is our 30th show.

6
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:30,146
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you believe that?

7
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:35,688
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been here every single week for about the past six months, a little more, seven months.

8
00:00:35,908 --> 00:00:38,029
[SPEAKER_03]: Ever since January, we've started this thing.

9
00:00:38,089 --> 00:00:40,450
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you guys for sticking with us throughout this whole thing.

10
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:42,891
[SPEAKER_03]: And, of course, hello to our new listeners as well.

11
00:00:42,931 --> 00:00:43,851
[SPEAKER_03]: We appreciate you guys.

12
00:00:44,226 --> 00:00:49,270
[SPEAKER_03]: Deciding to check us out and listening to our little program here about video games that don't suck.

13
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,952
[SPEAKER_03]: Although sometimes we have to talk about the sucky ones too.

14
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:54,214
[SPEAKER_03]: But just to warn you to stay away from them.

15
00:00:54,674 --> 00:00:56,516
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.

16
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:58,557
[SPEAKER_03]: Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts.

17
00:00:59,398 --> 00:01:02,040
[SPEAKER_03]: Right over there, the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

18
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:02,961
[SPEAKER_00]: Yo, yo, yo.

19
00:01:03,381 --> 00:01:03,802
[SPEAKER_00]: What up?

20
00:01:04,102 --> 00:01:04,682
[SPEAKER_00]: Menchie Hat.

21
00:01:05,783 --> 00:01:06,244
[SPEAKER_03]: How you doing?

22
00:01:06,424 --> 00:01:07,044
[SPEAKER_00]: Menchie Hat.

23
00:01:07,365 --> 00:01:08,986
[SPEAKER_03]: What is the Menchie Hat for those that may not know?

24
00:01:09,985 --> 00:01:14,366
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a hat that looks like the top of Minchi's head for anyone who's ever watched Excel Saga.

25
00:01:14,746 --> 00:01:15,386
[SPEAKER_03]: Excel Saga.

26
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:18,467
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, and over there is the one and only Loki.

27
00:01:18,947 --> 00:01:19,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes I am.

28
00:01:19,667 --> 00:01:20,087
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm right here.

29
00:01:20,467 --> 00:01:20,967
[SPEAKER_03]: How you doing?

30
00:01:22,008 --> 00:01:22,648
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doing good.

31
00:01:22,948 --> 00:01:23,408
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds good.

32
00:01:23,988 --> 00:01:25,508
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's go around.

33
00:01:25,548 --> 00:01:30,849
[SPEAKER_03]: We always like to start off the podcast letting you know about our gaming week and how we're doing in our gaming worlds.

34
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:32,710
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to start off with DarkSakura.

35
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:33,430
[SPEAKER_03]: What have you been up to?

36
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:37,011
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't played much of anything except DDR at the beginning of the week.

37
00:01:37,151 --> 00:01:37,871
[SPEAKER_00]: Like one game.

38
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:40,523
[SPEAKER_03]: What got you into DDR suddenly?

39
00:01:41,363 --> 00:01:43,605
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact that we were being filmed for the news.

40
00:01:45,245 --> 00:01:47,146
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, I totally forgot to say that.

41
00:01:47,186 --> 00:01:50,828
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello to anybody who might have seen us on the local news here in Sacramento.

42
00:01:51,008 --> 00:01:54,110
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my really cool jeans.

43
00:01:55,731 --> 00:01:57,051
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, that you saw in the article?

44
00:01:57,111 --> 00:01:58,472
[SPEAKER_00]: I was playing Silent Hill.

45
00:02:00,673 --> 00:02:05,335
[SPEAKER_03]: We were featured in a story on podcasting in the local news, so hello to anybody that found us through that.

46
00:02:05,736 --> 00:02:06,396
[SPEAKER_03]: Appreciate it.

47
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:09,309
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully you weren't scared off by the way we look.

48
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:13,950
[SPEAKER_03]: Or Loki saying, gosh, podcasting is fun.

49
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:16,331
[SPEAKER_04]: Gosh, I'm an idiot.

50
00:02:16,451 --> 00:02:18,131
[SPEAKER_03]: Or his sound clip, whatever he got.

51
00:02:18,451 --> 00:02:21,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, let's cut it down to really something stupid.

52
00:02:22,152 --> 00:02:23,192
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the stupidest line he can say?

53
00:02:23,292 --> 00:02:24,112
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, there it is, there it is.

54
00:02:24,212 --> 00:02:25,212
[SPEAKER_04]: Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it.

55
00:02:25,452 --> 00:02:26,432
[SPEAKER_04]: Got it, yeah.

56
00:02:27,032 --> 00:02:27,432
[SPEAKER_04]: I laughed.

57
00:02:27,813 --> 00:02:28,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, Loki.

58
00:02:28,393 --> 00:02:29,753
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you laughed and he called me.

59
00:02:29,933 --> 00:02:30,853
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you're an idiot.

60
00:02:31,373 --> 00:02:33,614
[SPEAKER_04]: They made me look like a dumbass on TV.

61
00:02:34,314 --> 00:02:34,694
[SPEAKER_04]: That's funny.

62
00:02:35,314 --> 00:02:36,154
[SPEAKER_04]: And I watched him like.

63
00:02:37,665 --> 00:02:40,586
[SPEAKER_03]: IntelligentLicense IntelligentCube

64
00:02:54,707 --> 00:02:55,588
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

65
00:03:11,861 --> 00:03:13,663
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

66
00:03:32,037 --> 00:03:32,958
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

67
00:03:52,587 --> 00:03:53,727
[SPEAKER_03]: But other than that, no.

68
00:03:54,028 --> 00:03:55,288
[SPEAKER_03]: Does it have orchestra music?

69
00:03:55,328 --> 00:03:57,609
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I remember Intelligent Cube had a very strange soundtrack.

70
00:03:57,689 --> 00:03:59,669
[SPEAKER_04]: It was all this big orchestra music.

71
00:03:59,689 --> 00:04:01,770
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got pretty good music in it, so it's decent.

72
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:02,930
[SPEAKER_04]: More of the same.

73
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:04,871
[SPEAKER_04]: But I've been playing that a lot.

74
00:04:05,091 --> 00:04:06,812
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, what was it?

75
00:04:06,892 --> 00:04:08,532
[SPEAKER_04]: Just recently I've been playing Peekaboo Poker.

76
00:04:09,352 --> 00:04:10,053
[SPEAKER_04]: Please.

77
00:04:10,973 --> 00:04:17,395
[SPEAKER_04]: On the Nintendo emulator, which is one of the three adult games for the...

78
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:22,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo Entertainment System, and it's very craptastic.

79
00:04:23,148 --> 00:04:25,229
[SPEAKER_04]: It's by the same people that did Bubble Bath Babes.

80
00:04:25,249 --> 00:04:29,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Bubble Bath Babes and Hot Slots, so I have all three of those.

81
00:04:30,143 --> 00:04:31,824
[SPEAKER_04]: There are some winning games right there.

82
00:04:31,904 --> 00:04:36,946
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember seeing Bubble Bath Bays back in the day in a rental store, and I was like, I'm going to play that someday.

83
00:04:37,426 --> 00:04:38,787
[SPEAKER_04]: And I did, and I was disappointed.

84
00:04:39,748 --> 00:04:41,208
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I played Killer7.

85
00:04:41,248 --> 00:04:42,809
[SPEAKER_04]: I progressed through another two levels.

86
00:04:43,189 --> 00:04:47,551
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's these one Heaven Smile things you have to attack.

87
00:04:47,571 --> 00:04:49,712
[SPEAKER_04]: They have t-shirts, and it's cool because you can just shoot them.

88
00:04:49,932 --> 00:04:51,333
[SPEAKER_04]: Then they have Giant Smile.

89
00:04:51,953 --> 00:04:55,835
[SPEAKER_04]: This game right now, I thought progressing through it, I'd figure out what's going on.

90
00:04:56,423 --> 00:04:59,965
[SPEAKER_04]: The more and more I progress through the game, the less and less I understand what's going on.

91
00:05:00,365 --> 00:05:01,065
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's still fun.

92
00:05:01,565 --> 00:05:02,406
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm playing through it still.

93
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:03,986
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool.

94
00:05:04,026 --> 00:05:04,386
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else?

95
00:05:05,047 --> 00:05:05,367
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

96
00:05:06,227 --> 00:05:06,867
[SPEAKER_03]: My gaming week.

97
00:05:07,228 --> 00:05:10,649
[SPEAKER_03]: I mentioned this very briefly at the end of the last podcast.

98
00:05:10,749 --> 00:05:19,232
[SPEAKER_03]: I just got a new television because my old one, the RCA yellow thing was coming loose and so my video kept fading in and out.

99
00:05:19,613 --> 00:05:25,355
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just finally decided to upgrade my TV and I went over to a big warehouse type store

100
00:05:25,697 --> 00:05:28,558
[SPEAKER_03]: and I bought a 30 inch HDTV widescreen.

101
00:05:28,838 --> 00:05:30,759
[SPEAKER_03]: So now I'm all about the widescreen games.

102
00:05:30,799 --> 00:05:36,221
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, oh, I gotta go back and play all these games because they're gonna look pretty and widescreen and I gotta find the ones that have the good graphics.

103
00:05:36,601 --> 00:05:38,922
[SPEAKER_03]: So I thought, okay, I'm gonna play Halo 2.

104
00:05:38,962 --> 00:05:41,223
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a very pretty looking game.

105
00:05:42,323 --> 00:05:45,605
[SPEAKER_03]: So I got on Halo 2 and I've been downloading the new maps and checking them out.

106
00:05:45,945 --> 00:05:48,906
[SPEAKER_03]: And I also got on and decided to play on Xbox Live again.

107
00:05:49,246 --> 00:05:53,087
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they've been doing all these updates to the game lately, so I thought I'd see if it played any differently.

108
00:05:53,407 --> 00:05:57,188
[SPEAKER_03]: And for someone like me, who's a casual Halo 2 gamer, I can't tell there's been any differences at all.

109
00:05:57,228 --> 00:05:58,048
[SPEAKER_03]: Except for the new maps.

110
00:05:58,128 --> 00:05:59,568
[SPEAKER_03]: And the new maps, you know, good idea.

111
00:05:59,808 --> 00:06:01,208
[SPEAKER_03]: Keeps the game fresh, so that's good.

112
00:06:02,269 --> 00:06:06,649
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing I did realize, however, is that I am the worst Halo 2 player on the entire internet.

113
00:06:07,149 --> 00:06:08,410
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, I'm horrible.

114
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:11,150
[SPEAKER_03]: I've played several games and my ranking hasn't budged.

115
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:12,430
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how bad I am.

116
00:06:12,891 --> 00:06:14,911
[SPEAKER_03]: So, if you ever see me...

117
00:06:15,566 --> 00:06:15,826
[SPEAKER_03]: Halo 2 Halo 2

118
00:06:37,642 --> 00:06:39,483
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get into some gaming news tonight.

119
00:06:39,724 --> 00:06:46,609
[SPEAKER_03]: And tonight I want to start off, actually I should mention, since I was talking about Halo 2, there actually was a new Halo 2 update this week.

120
00:06:47,029 --> 00:06:49,431
[SPEAKER_03]: They're calling it the Banhammer update.

121
00:06:49,511 --> 00:06:51,052
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically what they're doing is that

122
00:06:51,448 --> 00:06:53,629
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time.

123
00:07:11,673 --> 00:07:12,533
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

124
00:07:30,459 --> 00:07:31,020
[SPEAKER_03]: and DarkSakura.com.

125
00:07:54,830 --> 00:08:00,212
[SPEAKER_03]: Cheating is not honored around here and we will ban your ass type things.

126
00:08:00,612 --> 00:08:03,352
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously they don't use that kind of language, but you get the idea.

127
00:08:03,412 --> 00:08:08,034
[SPEAKER_03]: They're trying to put these little public service announcements that we catch you, we ban you type things.

128
00:08:08,614 --> 00:08:21,217
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just trying to curb the people that feel like they have to cheat to get ahead in Halo 2 because being the number one person on the Halo 2 leaderboard apparently wins you all this type of fame and fortune and all this stuff.

129
00:08:21,777 --> 00:08:23,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Every kid wants to be it.

130
00:08:23,658 --> 00:08:23,958
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

131
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:25,495
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't understand.

132
00:08:25,555 --> 00:08:26,956
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would somebody want to cheat on Halo 2?

133
00:08:27,616 --> 00:08:27,936
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fun.

134
00:08:27,956 --> 00:08:28,456
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to get ahead.

135
00:08:28,756 --> 00:08:29,717
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing better to do.

136
00:08:29,957 --> 00:08:31,297
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fun to get away with it.

137
00:08:31,617 --> 00:08:33,278
[SPEAKER_00]: They use the internet for self-validation.

138
00:08:33,718 --> 00:08:37,539
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like people in Final Fantasy XI who are teleporting themselves around.

139
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:40,140
[SPEAKER_04]: We have people on our link show that do that, actually.

140
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:45,742
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of Final Fantasy XI, maybe for not much longer, because they actually had a patch this week.

141
00:08:46,202 --> 00:08:49,183
[SPEAKER_03]: Their patch actually had a little something to do with Chains of Promethea.

142
00:08:49,203 --> 00:08:53,264
[SPEAKER_03]: They actually added a little more to the story in Chains of Promethea, and they added some more

143
00:08:53,612 --> 00:08:57,514
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically they're trying to wrap up the storyline there.

144
00:08:57,534 --> 00:08:59,295
[SPEAKER_03]: 43 megabyte download for PC users.

145
00:08:59,355 --> 00:09:00,035
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a pretty big quest.

146
00:09:00,055 --> 00:09:01,616
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so glad I quit that damn game.

147
00:09:01,656 --> 00:09:02,156
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

148
00:09:02,216 --> 00:09:04,517
[SPEAKER_03]: Quit raining on the rest of our parades.

149
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:06,198
[SPEAKER_00]: What, did you start playing again?

150
00:09:06,618 --> 00:09:07,338
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm thinking about it.

151
00:09:07,638 --> 00:09:09,479
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, you said you played PSO with me.

152
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:10,860
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't played in a month.

153
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,441
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no, PSO.

154
00:09:12,661 --> 00:09:13,381
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm thinking about it.

155
00:09:13,401 --> 00:09:14,261
[SPEAKER_04]: But I downloaded the patch.

156
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:16,683
[SPEAKER_03]: But you haven't played the game.

157
00:09:16,703 --> 00:09:17,403
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't played in a month.

158
00:09:17,703 --> 00:09:21,885
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the woman is yelling at me.

159
00:09:22,335 --> 00:09:23,135
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

160
00:09:32,076 --> 00:09:44,144
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, one thing that'll make the Final Fantasy fans happy, and this is actually something that made me happy because I've been waiting for them to do this for a long time, and it is something that is making me consider going back, but I'm not making any decisions until my work trips over next month.

161
00:09:44,225 --> 00:09:55,012
[SPEAKER_03]: But what they did is that they are going to have some of these items that were selling for tons and tons of Gil, the Leaping Boots, the Emperor's Hairpin, now they're rare EX items.

162
00:09:56,293 --> 00:09:59,015
[SPEAKER_03]: So Gil sellers can't camp them anymore for Gil, so...

163
00:09:59,753 --> 00:10:04,274
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, they'll find other ways to make their money with the gil selling, but they're trying to at least curb that a little bit.

164
00:10:04,334 --> 00:10:05,934
[SPEAKER_03]: So, very interesting.

165
00:10:06,315 --> 00:10:11,556
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, Squeenix, what we call Square Enix, they recently registered a brand new trademark.

166
00:10:11,596 --> 00:10:13,736
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called Treasures of Aturgen.

167
00:10:14,396 --> 00:10:17,637
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm, maybe a new Final Fantasy XI expansion?

168
00:10:17,837 --> 00:10:18,197
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows?

169
00:10:18,217 --> 00:10:20,678
[SPEAKER_04]: There was actually two names that were registered.

170
00:10:20,978 --> 00:10:21,838
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I didn't see the second one.

171
00:10:21,858 --> 00:10:22,518
[SPEAKER_03]: I only heard that one.

172
00:10:23,158 --> 00:10:24,379
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't remember the other one.

173
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:25,719
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll have to look it up.

174
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:26,278
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

175
00:10:26,558 --> 00:10:32,383
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, either way, rumors going around that with the Xbox 360 release, we're going to see a new expansion pack anyway.

176
00:10:32,763 --> 00:10:34,305
[SPEAKER_03]: So, all right.

177
00:10:34,365 --> 00:10:36,306
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

178
00:10:36,426 --> 00:10:36,867
[SPEAKER_03]: Cut it out.

179
00:10:37,247 --> 00:10:37,687
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

180
00:10:39,229 --> 00:10:40,930
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's open up the old mailbag.

181
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:43,312
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get into something DarkSakura might be interested in.

182
00:10:43,352 --> 00:10:44,413
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll go to the mailbag.

183
00:10:44,433 --> 00:10:45,994
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got lots of good ones.

184
00:10:46,174 --> 00:10:48,216
[SPEAKER_03]: We got some good mail this week in the mailbag.

185
00:10:49,016 --> 00:10:51,158
[SPEAKER_00]: I got more than what I actually ordered.

186
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,241
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to start off by reading one, then?

187
00:10:54,261 --> 00:10:55,442
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do you want me to go to one?

188
00:10:55,482 --> 00:10:55,762
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead.

189
00:10:56,192 --> 00:10:58,213
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, I'm going to start it off with an email.

190
00:10:59,053 --> 00:11:01,815
[SPEAKER_03]: This one came in from Rob.

191
00:11:02,475 --> 00:11:06,157
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob wanted to follow up with something that we were saying about the Silent Hill last week.

192
00:11:06,177 --> 00:11:08,097
[SPEAKER_03]: We were talking about Silent Hill 4 last week.

193
00:11:08,558 --> 00:11:10,198
[SPEAKER_03]: And somebody had been dogging on Silent Hill 3.

194
00:11:10,579 --> 00:11:11,159
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember.

195
00:11:12,259 --> 00:11:14,080
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you like Silent Hill 3, right, DarkSakura?

196
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,060
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it might have been our emailer was dogging on it.

197
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:22,662
[SPEAKER_03]: But Rob wanted to say that the PC version of Silent Hill 3 is a gazillion CDs, but it's only $9.99.

198
00:11:24,122 --> 00:11:26,963
[SPEAKER_03]: Best of all, it contains the Silent Hill 3 soundtrack.

199
00:11:27,383 --> 00:11:29,644
[SPEAKER_03]: I bought the soundtrack and got a game for free.

200
00:11:30,364 --> 00:11:32,444
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good way to check both out.

201
00:11:33,024 --> 00:11:39,106
[SPEAKER_00]: My response to him was if you buy Silent Hill 3 for the PlayStation 2, you get the soundtrack.

202
00:11:40,003 --> 00:11:40,263
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

203
00:11:40,643 --> 00:11:40,863
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

204
00:11:41,123 --> 00:11:41,944
[SPEAKER_03]: But for PC it's only $10.

205
00:11:42,564 --> 00:11:43,664
[SPEAKER_03]: How much is it on PS2 right now?

206
00:11:43,924 --> 00:11:46,085
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got to be at least a great $10, right?

207
00:11:47,445 --> 00:11:52,587
[SPEAKER_03]: So either way, I like that when they throw in those bonuses like the soundtrack and things to get you to check the game out.

208
00:11:52,627 --> 00:11:53,787
[SPEAKER_04]: That is pretty cool.

209
00:11:54,247 --> 00:12:00,749
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just mentioned the other name that was out there that Square Enix registered was Scars of War.

210
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:01,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

211
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:03,710
[SPEAKER_03]: That could be its own game, though.

212
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:04,491
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably.

213
00:12:04,751 --> 00:12:08,752
[SPEAKER_00]: I also got another one from him talking about...

214
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:21,067
[SPEAKER_00]: How is in Toys R Us the other day, and the six-year-old could understand that an M-rated game was for a teen and not for the kid, but parents don't seem to understand that?

215
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:21,767
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm-hmm.

216
00:12:22,247 --> 00:12:23,028
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's pretty funny.

217
00:12:24,594 --> 00:12:25,855
[SPEAKER_00]: In a very sad way.

218
00:12:26,195 --> 00:12:30,157
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, in a very sad way that the six-year-old understands the ratings better than his parents, certainly.

219
00:12:31,578 --> 00:12:37,142
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to read another email here that came from... Let's see, who was this person?

220
00:12:37,402 --> 00:12:39,583
[SPEAKER_03]: TheBrainTrust was the person that sent this email.

221
00:12:40,123 --> 00:12:42,685
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was actually talking about the hot coffee mod.

222
00:12:43,525 --> 00:12:46,027
[SPEAKER_03]: He talked a lot about that in the beginning of his email.

223
00:12:46,047 --> 00:12:51,670
[SPEAKER_03]: And he had an interesting perspective on that, basically, that he thought that video games overdo it sometimes.

224
00:12:52,891 --> 00:12:53,571
[SPEAKER_03]: and DarkSakura.com.

225
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:23,773
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell that to the fundamentalists.

226
00:13:24,233 --> 00:13:27,575
[SPEAKER_03]: To that I say, you're right.

227
00:13:28,596 --> 00:13:39,262
[SPEAKER_03]: When we're kind of poking fun at the whole thing and we're saying that Christians think that these games are evil, I'd like to think that usually we preface it by saying that it's

228
00:13:39,813 --> 00:13:41,894
[SPEAKER_03]: The extremists we're talking about in this case.

229
00:13:41,914 --> 00:13:44,196
[SPEAKER_00]: The ones who actually publicly make the complaint.

230
00:13:44,336 --> 00:13:45,417
[SPEAKER_03]: The 700 Club.

231
00:13:45,557 --> 00:13:50,400
[SPEAKER_03]: Not every Christian is a crazy, foaming at the mouth, like crazy, I'm going to ban games.

232
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,521
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the morons behind the Chick Tracks.

233
00:13:53,302 --> 00:13:57,805
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, whoever has succeeded Jerry Falwell in his camp.

234
00:13:58,645 --> 00:14:00,246
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the fundamentalists.

235
00:14:00,346 --> 00:14:08,231
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have some good friends who are Christians, and I'm not, you know, I personally am not into that religion, but I have no problem being a Christian.

236
00:14:08,251 --> 00:14:08,952
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to church today.

237
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:10,440
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

238
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:14,161
[SPEAKER_04]: Besides, it's not really hip to make fun of Christian people.

239
00:14:14,201 --> 00:14:16,382
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hip to make fun of Scientology.

240
00:14:16,562 --> 00:14:17,182
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, that's true.

241
00:14:17,202 --> 00:14:18,402
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a new religion to be making fun of.

242
00:14:18,422 --> 00:14:19,923
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always been funny to make fun of Scientology.

243
00:14:20,323 --> 00:14:33,946
[SPEAKER_03]: In all seriousness, and you can say this about any group of people, whether it be a religious group, an ethnic group, a, I don't know, whatever you come up with, a group of anybody, gamers even, there's always a few bad apples that ruin it for everyone.

244
00:14:33,986 --> 00:14:37,107
[SPEAKER_03]: So when we poke fun, we're only poking fun at the extremists

245
00:14:37,688 --> 00:14:39,990
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, there's plenty of great Christian folks.

246
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:44,654
[SPEAKER_03]: I have friends that are Christians, just like I have friends that are Buddhists and friends that are other religions.

247
00:14:45,154 --> 00:14:53,240
[SPEAKER_03]: And the great thing about the country where we live in, playing the anthem, is that you can have freedom of religion and choice and all that good stuff.

248
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,181
[SPEAKER_00]: But not for much longer!

249
00:14:56,763 --> 00:14:58,184
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, freedom of choice, but the government knows better.

250
00:14:58,204 --> 00:14:59,925
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, keep voting in those conservatives.

251
00:14:59,966 --> 00:15:01,307
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll be gone real quick.

252
00:15:01,327 --> 00:15:04,189
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't start the political thing or we're going to get tons and tons of emails.

253
00:15:04,309 --> 00:15:05,250
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not, I'm not, I'm not.

254
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:06,931
[SPEAKER_04]: I watched Outfoxed last night.

255
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:09,782
[SPEAKER_03]: You got another email you want to read, DarkSakura?

256
00:15:10,345 --> 00:15:11,150
[SPEAKER_00]: I lost my place.

257
00:15:11,989 --> 00:15:14,270
[SPEAKER_03]: I got another one then, if you don't have one.

258
00:15:14,691 --> 00:15:15,231
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep going.

259
00:15:15,591 --> 00:15:16,572
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to read this one.

260
00:15:16,612 --> 00:15:17,272
[SPEAKER_03]: This is cool.

261
00:15:17,312 --> 00:15:24,836
[SPEAKER_03]: This was from a guy named Chris, and he actually works on a site called A Society Wildcard.

262
00:15:25,476 --> 00:15:34,181
[SPEAKER_03]: He wants to say, I wanted to thank you guys for providing an excellent, entertaining, and informative podcast amongst the mediocrity and crap that is swimming out there in the podcast ocean.

263
00:15:34,561 --> 00:15:35,262
[SPEAKER_03]: That's quite a compliment.

264
00:15:35,302 --> 00:15:35,902
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

265
00:15:35,922 --> 00:15:36,462
[SPEAKER_03]: That's very cool.

266
00:15:36,482 --> 00:15:39,544
[SPEAKER_04]: That's no way to be talking about Governor Schwarzenegger's podcast.

267
00:15:40,404 --> 00:15:41,725
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

268
00:15:56,637 --> 00:16:02,883
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so please, um, make sure you subscribe to the show via iTunes or via iPod or some other form.

269
00:16:03,263 --> 00:16:06,827
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't rely on necessarily, um, Podcast Alley.

270
00:16:07,487 --> 00:16:13,132
[SPEAKER_03]: Although it's a great site, I'm not going to knock Podcast Alley, it's a great site and we have a lot of great people who have voted for us over there as well.

271
00:16:13,733 --> 00:16:13,793
[SPEAKER_03]: Um,

272
00:16:14,782 --> 00:16:21,143
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just really, really big, and they don't have time to work on each little individual podcast and its problems.

273
00:16:21,223 --> 00:16:22,704
[SPEAKER_00]: He's given us a plug on his show.

274
00:16:22,724 --> 00:16:24,464
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's only fair to do the same for him.

275
00:16:24,724 --> 00:16:25,304
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.

276
00:16:25,364 --> 00:16:26,084
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got a show.

277
00:16:26,284 --> 00:16:26,724
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to do that?

278
00:16:27,004 --> 00:16:33,426
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to thechrissshow.blogspot.com, his podcast is available there.

279
00:16:34,446 --> 00:16:34,766
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds good.

280
00:16:34,986 --> 00:16:41,067
[SPEAKER_03]: And he says he's a filmmaker, so I just want you to know that if you need a good actor, I do all my own nude scenes, just so you know.

281
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,522
[SPEAKER_04]: I can do voice acting.

282
00:16:44,642 --> 00:16:48,126
[SPEAKER_04]: I have my kick-ass one-liners like podcasting.

283
00:16:48,787 --> 00:16:49,548
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so much fun.

284
00:16:50,789 --> 00:16:52,531
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, you got any more emails for us, DarkSakura?

285
00:16:52,551 --> 00:16:53,132
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll do one more.

286
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:55,515
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I sent you a bunch.

287
00:16:55,535 --> 00:16:57,798
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we got most.

288
00:16:57,858 --> 00:16:58,599
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, here was another one.

289
00:16:58,939 --> 00:16:59,299
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's one.

290
00:16:59,440 --> 00:16:59,920
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll read this one.

291
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:00,581
[SPEAKER_03]: This will be the last one.

292
00:17:01,142 --> 00:17:01,242
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

293
00:17:02,495 --> 00:17:05,217
[SPEAKER_03]: This one comes to us from Brian in Michigan.

294
00:17:05,917 --> 00:17:08,819
[SPEAKER_03]: And he says he's been listening to the podcast for a few weeks now.

295
00:17:08,879 --> 00:17:09,200
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

296
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:13,602
[SPEAKER_03]: And he enjoys the discussion and our thoughts on the news that's interesting.

297
00:17:13,642 --> 00:17:15,324
[SPEAKER_03]: He likes the fact that we kind of talk about things.

298
00:17:15,364 --> 00:17:16,925
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't just kind of report, report, report.

299
00:17:16,945 --> 00:17:17,365
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you.

300
00:17:17,385 --> 00:17:18,005
[SPEAKER_03]: We appreciate that.

301
00:17:18,686 --> 00:17:21,027
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, another vote for the Drunken Loki episode.

302
00:17:21,188 --> 00:17:21,688
[SPEAKER_03]: He liked that.

303
00:17:23,629 --> 00:17:23,869
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

304
00:17:23,889 --> 00:17:24,590
[SPEAKER_03]: I have one more.

305
00:17:27,034 --> 00:17:28,195
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no, I want to say the rest.

306
00:17:28,215 --> 00:17:29,336
[SPEAKER_03]: There's another part to this here.

307
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:30,918
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got a suggestion for us.

308
00:17:30,998 --> 00:17:34,261
[SPEAKER_03]: How about some discussion on popular mods for PC games?

309
00:17:34,761 --> 00:17:38,365
[SPEAKER_03]: He says, I don't think mods get enough airtime, and there are some great ones out there.

310
00:17:38,685 --> 00:17:44,430
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's also not forget how many mods have become full games and how many modders have received jobs in the industry.

311
00:17:44,951 --> 00:17:45,791
[SPEAKER_03]: Very interesting point.

312
00:17:45,871 --> 00:17:49,355
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to admit, unfortunately, I don't play a lot of PC games.

313
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:51,557
[SPEAKER_03]: I do most of my gaming on console.

314
00:17:52,097 --> 00:17:54,299
[SPEAKER_03]: Not that I don't respect a lot of PC games out there.

315
00:17:54,339 --> 00:18:00,124
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm actually really looking forward to Civilization 4, which, by the way, is supposed to be very mod-friendly.

316
00:18:00,384 --> 00:18:04,667
[SPEAKER_03]: They're supposed to be building this whole programming language, and they're going to make it very mod-friendly.

317
00:18:04,707 --> 00:18:05,588
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's very cool.

318
00:18:06,129 --> 00:18:08,511
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, you would probably know more about the modding thing.

319
00:18:08,971 --> 00:18:10,572
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't you talk about the PC mods so much?

320
00:18:10,632 --> 00:18:13,254
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I don't play a lot of PC games anymore.

321
00:18:13,495 --> 00:18:15,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, what I've been playing...

322
00:18:16,132 --> 00:18:17,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe Grand Theft Auto a little bit.

323
00:18:17,593 --> 00:18:18,854
[SPEAKER_04]: I have the hot coffee mod.

324
00:18:19,094 --> 00:18:31,304
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't actually played the hot coffee portion because getting the damn girlfriends to actually understand you and like, you know, you have to take them out on dates and it's really hard because they want to go do drive-bys and they end up dying a lot of times.

325
00:18:31,324 --> 00:18:33,906
[SPEAKER_04]: They get shot in the head and you're like, oh, your girlfriend's dead.

326
00:18:34,226 --> 00:18:35,507
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, damn.

327
00:18:36,207 --> 00:18:36,928
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't do that.

328
00:18:36,988 --> 00:18:41,571
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead, what I do is I download even more mods like the spider car mod where you can drive cars up walls.

329
00:18:41,611 --> 00:18:45,014
[SPEAKER_04]: Just crazy stuff like actually doing my own modding where you just

330
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:47,763
[SPEAKER_04]: Adjust the aspects of different cars and stuff.

331
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,724
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's some pretty cool ones.

332
00:18:50,124 --> 00:18:59,327
[SPEAKER_04]: There's one for, I think it was Unreal or Quake, the Enter the Tube or whatever like that, the Penny Arcade mod that they had for that.

333
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:00,108
[SPEAKER_04]: That was pretty cool.

334
00:19:01,748 --> 00:19:05,650
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of mods out there, but unfortunately, I don't play a lot of them.

335
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:08,351
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just not in the budget for us to be getting a lot of PC games.

336
00:19:08,571 --> 00:19:12,673
[SPEAKER_00]: The last mod I ever did was Gatchaman Quake.

337
00:19:14,358 --> 00:19:14,898
[SPEAKER_03]: That's old.

338
00:19:14,918 --> 00:19:16,720
[SPEAKER_03]: Quake was almost 10 years ago, so it's old.

339
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:21,162
[SPEAKER_04]: Quake Rally, where they turned that game into a racing game.

340
00:19:21,483 --> 00:19:25,045
[SPEAKER_03]: But some of those like that get adopted and get huge followings to them.

341
00:19:26,446 --> 00:19:35,011
[SPEAKER_03]: If any game publishers out there want to send us some free games, and we will definitely look into how the internet is modding your game on the PC, we'll certainly talk about it on the show.

342
00:19:35,732 --> 00:19:37,593
[SPEAKER_03]: Drop us an email, togo, T-O-G-O.

343
00:19:38,053 --> 00:19:39,154
[SPEAKER_03]: at OrangeLingerie.com.

344
00:19:39,254 --> 00:19:42,455
[SPEAKER_03]: And you should do that anyway if you have any general comments on the show.

345
00:19:42,495 --> 00:19:43,555
[SPEAKER_03]: You got one more email for us?

346
00:19:43,816 --> 00:19:47,817
[SPEAKER_00]: We had one from someone named Spencer just talking about the music games.

347
00:19:48,678 --> 00:19:51,379
[SPEAKER_00]: Wanted our opinions on Rockstar, Red Octane, Mad Catz.

348
00:19:52,099 --> 00:19:53,980
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's apparently an Indie Group fan.

349
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:58,682
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have to say that if you really want our true opinion on the music games, you should probably check out our live show.

350
00:19:59,252 --> 00:20:01,554
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true, we do talk about it for three hours.

351
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:04,357
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's kind of a loose term.

352
00:20:04,377 --> 00:20:05,738
[SPEAKER_03]: A three-hour train wreck.

353
00:20:05,798 --> 00:20:07,900
[SPEAKER_03]: We talk strictly about the music games.

354
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:15,927
[SPEAKER_03]: We do do a live show on OrangeLawnRadio.com for three hours every Sunday night, and you can hear Loki really rip on In the Groove, because he doesn't care for the game.

355
00:20:16,788 --> 00:20:20,331
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will second that, because In the Groove is kind of, but...

356
00:20:20,922 --> 00:20:23,304
[SPEAKER_03]: I, on the other hand, I'm not bothered by In the Groove.

357
00:20:23,344 --> 00:20:26,485
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it does some good things for the dance game community.

358
00:20:26,706 --> 00:20:38,813
[SPEAKER_03]: For those who don't know what In the Groove is, it's kind of controversial in the music game scene because it was a game that was made by fans of Dance Dance Revolution who were sad to see that Dance Dance Revolution stopped.

359
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:39,974
[SPEAKER_03]: and DarkSakura.

360
00:20:59,065 --> 00:21:00,606
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, it's just very controversial.

361
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:03,727
[SPEAKER_03]: I like In the Groove somewhat.

362
00:21:03,787 --> 00:21:05,647
[SPEAKER_03]: I like some of the things that it brings to the table.

363
00:21:06,027 --> 00:21:08,708
[SPEAKER_03]: I like some of the music in the game.

364
00:21:09,028 --> 00:21:12,790
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Mines, when used appropriately, is an interesting new twist on the dance game.

365
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:18,632
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's a lot of things I don't like about it, and a lot of it has to do with the online community.

366
00:21:18,692 --> 00:21:28,555
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate to say it, but I just really hope you're not one of these guys that's online saying, you know, oh, DDR is dead and DDR sucks because In the Groove owns everything.

367
00:21:29,025 --> 00:21:34,487
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, In The Groove does one-up DDR on some things, but... It would not have existed without DDR.

368
00:21:34,507 --> 00:21:45,630
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we have to can't forget that In The Groove would not exist without DDR, and the fact that DDR is not dead, it's got plenty of home releases still coming out, including Extreme 2, Ultramix 3 coming out later this year.

369
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:54,012
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, not to dog on the scene as a whole, because I know some really nice people in the In The Groove scene, but just some of the message boards really ruffle my feathers.

370
00:21:55,097 --> 00:21:57,478
[SPEAKER_04]: I too got an email, but it was something funny.

371
00:21:57,618 --> 00:22:07,061
[SPEAKER_04]: It was referring back to the episode in which I mentioned how games help kids fight with diseases.

372
00:22:07,162 --> 00:22:08,422
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mentioned Tumor Raider.

373
00:22:09,042 --> 00:22:11,083
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone sent me a Clarisworks file.

374
00:22:11,423 --> 00:22:14,164
[SPEAKER_04]: And if I remember correctly, I think Clarisworks is a Mac.

375
00:22:15,044 --> 00:22:16,785
[SPEAKER_04]: It's something that runs on an Apple PC.

376
00:22:17,534 --> 00:22:22,437
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, I do not, you know, I do not have such inferior PCs.

377
00:22:22,457 --> 00:22:23,718
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not even going into this.

378
00:22:23,738 --> 00:22:23,978
[SPEAKER_00]: Next story.

379
00:22:23,998 --> 00:22:26,460
[SPEAKER_04]: Not start the Apple versus PC thing again.

380
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:29,662
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we do not need to hear the closed-minded speak out of his ass.

381
00:22:31,423 --> 00:22:31,883
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

382
00:22:32,724 --> 00:22:33,384
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on.

383
00:22:33,564 --> 00:22:34,905
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I have some fun news.

384
00:22:35,305 --> 00:22:36,126
[SPEAKER_03]: You have a fun news?

385
00:22:36,166 --> 00:22:36,886
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you want to tell us about?

386
00:22:36,906 --> 00:22:37,787
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really fun.

387
00:22:37,887 --> 00:22:38,788
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really depressing.

388
00:22:39,148 --> 00:22:39,548
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

389
00:22:39,988 --> 00:22:41,429
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we play the happy music again?

390
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:42,190
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

391
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:42,570
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

392
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:43,691
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

393
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:44,972
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be horrible.

394
00:22:45,132 --> 00:22:45,392
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

395
00:22:45,412 --> 00:22:46,232
[SPEAKER_00]: No, read the story.

396
00:22:46,252 --> 00:22:46,513
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

397
00:22:46,553 --> 00:22:46,973
[SPEAKER_03]: Read the story.

398
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:58,425
[SPEAKER_00]: A 12-year-old named Gary Lloyd, apparently in London, hung himself after his mother took away his PlayStation.

399
00:23:00,006 --> 00:23:04,668
[SPEAKER_00]: It turned out to be he was doing it to get attention, and his little prank went wrong.

400
00:23:06,029 --> 00:23:13,052
[SPEAKER_00]: So, any children listening to the show, if your mom takes away your PlayStation, don't hang yourself, because you'll die.

401
00:23:13,472 --> 00:23:14,553
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, try going outside.

402
00:23:15,393 --> 00:23:16,013
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do something else.

403
00:23:16,233 --> 00:23:19,695
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's like a world out there with air and birds and stuff.

404
00:23:21,816 --> 00:23:23,476
[SPEAKER_04]: All he needed was just an extra life.

405
00:23:25,397 --> 00:23:25,957
[SPEAKER_00]: So wrong.

406
00:23:26,337 --> 00:23:26,797
[SPEAKER_00]: So wrong.

407
00:23:27,338 --> 00:23:28,818
[SPEAKER_00]: Wah, wah, wah, boo!

408
00:23:28,898 --> 00:23:36,701
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is pretty crappy, just... Kids... Half of me wants to say it's Darwinism at work.

409
00:23:37,402 --> 00:23:39,202
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, there's something else going on here.

410
00:23:39,562 --> 00:23:42,144
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll have you know, Grand Theft Auto does not have hangings.

411
00:23:42,544 --> 00:23:43,364
[SPEAKER_04]: Texas does, though.

412
00:23:46,747 --> 00:23:54,653
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on, speaking of Grand Theft Auto and like stories, we have a story about the Miami attorney Jack Thompson.

413
00:23:55,073 --> 00:23:55,954
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe you know this guy.

414
00:23:55,994 --> 00:23:57,715
[SPEAKER_03]: He's crazy!

415
00:23:58,056 --> 00:24:03,319
[SPEAKER_03]: He's foaming at the mouth crazy when it comes to wanting to rip video games, a new one, for being too violent.

416
00:24:03,339 --> 00:24:04,741
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, guess what game he's going after now?

417
00:24:05,221 --> 00:24:05,601
[SPEAKER_03]: Sims 2!

418
00:24:06,702 --> 00:24:10,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, he says that naked people in The Sims 2 is just...

419
00:24:11,187 --> 00:24:11,688
[SPEAKER_03]: Horrible.

420
00:24:12,068 --> 00:24:12,709
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's a quote.

421
00:24:12,769 --> 00:24:22,759
[SPEAKER_03]: Sims 2, the latest version of the Sims video game franchise, contains, according to the video game news sites, full frontal nudity, including nipples, penises, labia, and pubic hair.

422
00:24:23,019 --> 00:24:23,560
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, come on.

423
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:24,241
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pathetic.

424
00:24:24,321 --> 00:24:24,861
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?

425
00:24:24,941 --> 00:24:25,582
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it doesn't.

426
00:24:25,722 --> 00:24:27,304
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to say all those words on a podcast.

427
00:24:27,564 --> 00:24:28,125
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it doesn't.

428
00:24:29,146 --> 00:24:31,028
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the mods that put that on there.

429
00:24:32,826 --> 00:24:37,929
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's a big, big difference between what's going on here and what's going on with Grand Theft Auto.

430
00:24:38,509 --> 00:24:43,631
[SPEAKER_03]: I call what happened with Grand Theft Auto, San Andreas, and the whole hot coffee thing lazy programming.

431
00:24:43,951 --> 00:24:47,513
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason being, and we've seen this happen before with DDR.

432
00:24:49,723 --> 00:24:54,766
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we, you know, DarkSakura, Loki, myself, have been talking about DDR for years, so we've been following the franchise.

433
00:24:55,167 --> 00:25:06,394
[SPEAKER_03]: And when it had a release on the PlayStation, its very first release, some hackers found on the disc a background for the song Bad Girls where somebody had airbrushed out the gun.

434
00:25:06,754 --> 00:25:10,296
[SPEAKER_03]: So it makes it look like that they had prepped that song to be ready for U.S.

435
00:25:10,396 --> 00:25:12,958
[SPEAKER_03]: audiences, but they took the song out at the last minute.

436
00:25:13,118 --> 00:25:20,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Or if you even want to go more recent, DDR Extreme, where they had a completely, a song that wasn't even in the game, but you could play it.

437
00:25:20,122 --> 00:25:21,903
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right, you had Memories, remember that?

438
00:25:21,963 --> 00:25:28,566
[SPEAKER_03]: Memories is completely in the game, and with hack codes, you could hack your memory card file to play Memories on DDR Extreme.

439
00:25:28,886 --> 00:25:32,487
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though the song wasn't supposed to be there for whatever reason at the last minute they took it out.

440
00:25:32,987 --> 00:25:34,027
[SPEAKER_03]: But what did they take out?

441
00:25:34,948 --> 00:25:42,329
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a pain in the butt, I guess for compiling or whatever reasons, I'm not a programmer, but it's a pain in the butt to take out the entire chunk of game.

442
00:25:42,689 --> 00:25:49,391
[SPEAKER_03]: It's easier to take out the little pointer that points to that file because all these games work on a giant flowchart.

443
00:25:49,751 --> 00:25:52,353
[SPEAKER_03]: It's easier to take out the pointer that says play this song.

444
00:25:52,693 --> 00:26:03,241
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what I think happened with Grand Theft Auto, that Rockstar had every intention of doing this sex thing, but at the last minute somebody thought, you know what, maybe this is a little much.

445
00:26:03,762 --> 00:26:06,884
[SPEAKER_03]: So instead of taking the whole thing out of the game, what did they take out?

446
00:26:06,984 --> 00:26:08,045
[SPEAKER_03]: They took out the pointer.

447
00:26:08,485 --> 00:26:12,969
[SPEAKER_03]: and when the PC version came out, it was exposed that the hot coffee thing was in there.

448
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:19,636
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody put the pointer back in and sure enough, PlayStation and Xbox versions, the pointers, they figure out how to put them back in.

449
00:26:19,956 --> 00:26:25,281
[SPEAKER_03]: Rockstar has to admit, yes, the sex thing was in the game the whole time but they didn't intend on it being discovered.

450
00:26:25,761 --> 00:26:29,286
[SPEAKER_03]: And I believe it, that they probably had taken the pointers out, not realizing.

451
00:26:29,746 --> 00:26:31,188
[SPEAKER_03]: It's lazy programming, I call it.

452
00:26:31,829 --> 00:26:36,255
[SPEAKER_03]: So, but now with the Sims, that's not, you don't have a pointer, or at least with the Sims 2.

453
00:26:36,855 --> 00:26:42,623
[SPEAKER_03]: Rumor is in the original Sims, and I didn't play enough of the Sims, but that there actually was a code where you could undo the blur or whatever.

454
00:26:42,703 --> 00:26:43,504
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a patch.

455
00:26:43,744 --> 00:26:44,385
[SPEAKER_03]: It's another mod.

456
00:26:44,785 --> 00:26:48,587
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing is that even under the blur, there was no detail.

457
00:26:49,367 --> 00:26:51,608
[SPEAKER_00]: All it is is another skin that has the detail.

458
00:26:51,788 --> 00:26:51,988
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

459
00:26:52,368 --> 00:26:54,689
[SPEAKER_03]: And even there was actually a quote.

460
00:26:54,769 --> 00:26:58,751
[SPEAKER_03]: Jeff Brown, Vice President of Corporate Communications at EA, says, This is nonsense.

461
00:26:59,051 --> 00:27:00,712
[SPEAKER_03]: We reviewed 100% of the content.

462
00:27:00,732 --> 00:27:03,293
[SPEAKER_03]: There is no content inappropriate for a teen audience.

463
00:27:03,593 --> 00:27:05,134
[SPEAKER_03]: Players never see a nude sim.

464
00:27:05,454 --> 00:27:11,336
[SPEAKER_03]: If someone with an extreme amount of expertise and time were to remove the pixels, they would see that the sims have no genitals.

465
00:27:11,376 --> 00:27:12,857
[SPEAKER_03]: They appear like Ken and Barbie.

466
00:27:12,877 --> 00:27:12,977
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

467
00:27:13,197 --> 00:27:21,959
[SPEAKER_04]: What they're talking about, though, is the nude sim patches where people have actually modified, because in The Sims 2, you can actually modify your character, and so they added that stuff in.

468
00:27:22,219 --> 00:27:26,299
[SPEAKER_04]: But the thing is, and this guy's like going, oh, well, they're just letting that happen.

469
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:37,281
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they want people to make mods so you can make new clothing, you can make new items, etc., because that stuff, they have whole communities built around that where you can buy new skins, you can make characters that look like Austin Powers, etc.

470
00:27:37,361 --> 00:27:41,702
[SPEAKER_00]: On The Sims 2 site themselves, they offer a mod of the month, basically.

471
00:27:41,842 --> 00:27:42,042
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

472
00:27:42,442 --> 00:27:44,903
[SPEAKER_03]: They would not highlight a nude patch as the mod of the month.

473
00:27:44,943 --> 00:27:46,084
[SPEAKER_03]: They have that kind of case.

474
00:27:46,424 --> 00:27:47,385
[SPEAKER_04]: And they have houses.

475
00:27:47,425 --> 00:27:50,026
[SPEAKER_04]: You can buy houses and bring them in or whatever.

476
00:27:50,186 --> 00:27:52,467
[SPEAKER_03]: But that same thing's been going on for years.

477
00:27:52,567 --> 00:27:53,488
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember Tomb Raider?

478
00:27:53,508 --> 00:27:56,409
[SPEAKER_03]: They had the nude Laura patch within six months of the game coming out.

479
00:27:56,789 --> 00:27:58,270
[SPEAKER_03]: And where was this guy then?

480
00:27:58,350 --> 00:27:59,290
[SPEAKER_04]: He doesn't do his research.

481
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:00,591
[SPEAKER_04]: That's clearly what it is.

482
00:28:00,671 --> 00:28:01,672
[SPEAKER_04]: He doesn't do his research.

483
00:28:01,712 --> 00:28:02,872
[SPEAKER_04]: So take this one to court.

484
00:28:02,912 --> 00:28:04,533
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to nail you in the ass.

485
00:28:04,633 --> 00:28:06,135
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's what they're going to find the difference is.

486
00:28:06,196 --> 00:28:09,561
[SPEAKER_03]: And I hope somebody sits down in front of Congress and explains this to them.

487
00:28:09,802 --> 00:28:13,287
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't control what the people on the internet are going to do to the code of the game.

488
00:28:14,349 --> 00:28:17,615
[SPEAKER_03]: But in the case of Grand Theft Auto, I think it was a lazy pointer programming thing.

489
00:28:18,143 --> 00:28:24,687
[SPEAKER_04]: But even still, if that was the case, this shouldn't have even gone as far as it was, even if it was lazy programming.

490
00:28:25,027 --> 00:28:26,848
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's stupid.

491
00:28:27,028 --> 00:28:27,749
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really dumb.

492
00:28:27,869 --> 00:28:38,855
[SPEAKER_03]: I think all games are going to suffer because of this, not necessarily content-wise, but programmers aren't going to be so lazy anymore, and they're going to push back the release dates of their games so they can clean out the code so you people don't find them.

493
00:28:38,875 --> 00:28:39,795
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what's going to suffer?

494
00:28:40,296 --> 00:28:40,976
[SPEAKER_00]: Free expression.

495
00:28:41,556 --> 00:28:42,377
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what's going to suffer.

496
00:28:43,151 --> 00:28:47,272
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's kind of funny though, because there are a lot of lazy programmers out there.

497
00:28:48,132 --> 00:28:58,936
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the Dance Dance Revolution games, they sometimes used to have these things like dummy files that they would put on the disc to fill up space or whatever, so it would make them harder to rip or whatever.

498
00:28:59,896 --> 00:29:06,018
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the Dance Dance Revolution games, I think it was Max 2, had the entire source code for Beatmania 5 on it.

499
00:29:07,874 --> 00:29:08,994
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'd heard about that.

500
00:29:36,234 --> 00:29:37,336
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

501
00:29:54,474 --> 00:29:56,536
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, what's going on in the UK for our friends overseas?

502
00:29:56,556 --> 00:29:58,257
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, actually this is more of an international thing.

503
00:30:22,632 --> 00:30:49,772
[SPEAKER_00]: About Hironobu Sakaguchi, you know, Final Fantasy creator Basically is saying that he's got a couple games in works on the Xbox 360 However, they will not be playable at the Tokyo Game Show in September Oh, interesting But they are basically making progress on it They're getting the graphics in order It's just been slow progress What about Final Fantasy XII, dammit?

504
00:30:51,478 --> 00:30:58,600
[SPEAKER_00]: Also in news, Archer McLean, he was the creative director at Awesome Studios.

505
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,321
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually were the company that put out Mercury.

506
00:31:01,581 --> 00:31:02,021
[SPEAKER_00]: He resigned.

507
00:31:02,941 --> 00:31:07,583
[SPEAKER_00]: But said that overall he was really more of a figurehead, so it's not really a major loss.

508
00:31:08,703 --> 00:31:14,284
[SPEAKER_03]: And Loki, your review on Mercury pretty much convinced me not to buy the game, so I guess this is no big loss.

509
00:31:14,605 --> 00:31:15,985
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't that great of a game.

510
00:31:16,045 --> 00:31:16,705
[SPEAKER_04]: It was okay.

511
00:31:16,725 --> 00:31:19,846
[SPEAKER_04]: It was sort of different, but I got bored with it really quick.

512
00:31:20,031 --> 00:31:21,912
[SPEAKER_03]: What could they have done to make the game better?

513
00:31:22,292 --> 00:31:24,393
[SPEAKER_04]: I was expecting something sort of like Marble Madness.

514
00:31:24,513 --> 00:31:31,557
[SPEAKER_04]: The mazes were too short, and it was just very... A lot of levels, they were really short, and it just didn't do it for me.

515
00:31:31,657 --> 00:31:32,778
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just kind of a pain in the butt.

516
00:31:34,244 --> 00:31:37,947
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the last thing is a game I haven't heard much on coming up for the U.S.

517
00:31:38,007 --> 00:31:38,367
[SPEAKER_00]: market.

518
00:31:38,987 --> 00:31:42,470
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure it will, but it's called Another Code, Two Memories.

519
00:31:43,471 --> 00:31:47,293
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, it's sort of like a combination of an interactive sim.

520
00:31:47,313 --> 00:31:55,919
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like the dating sims were, except you also have a little map where you guide somebody through a house, and you have puzzles to get them through this house.

521
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:59,062
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're using both screens, one for your communication with a ghost,

522
00:31:59,702 --> 00:32:01,303
[SPEAKER_00]: and the other to navigate.

523
00:32:01,843 --> 00:32:05,385
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's supposed to be a little semi-survival horror puzzle game.

524
00:32:06,205 --> 00:32:06,906
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks pretty cool.

525
00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:08,487
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool.

526
00:32:08,867 --> 00:32:09,287
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds good.

527
00:32:10,528 --> 00:32:10,928
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

528
00:32:12,309 --> 00:32:15,470
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's move on to some other news, talking about Xbox Live.

529
00:32:16,291 --> 00:32:19,552
[SPEAKER_03]: There was actually a story posted on, I'm not sure if this is Gamasutra.

530
00:32:19,912 --> 00:32:22,694
[SPEAKER_03]: I always want to say Gamasutra so it can rhyme with the book, you know.

531
00:32:23,674 --> 00:32:24,735
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think it's Gamasutra.

532
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:32,637
[SPEAKER_03]: They ran a story earlier this week that says that Microsoft is announcing 2 million Xbox Live subscribers.

533
00:32:32,717 --> 00:32:35,320
[SPEAKER_03]: The last time that they had made an announcement was back in January.

534
00:32:35,881 --> 00:32:38,063
[SPEAKER_03]: 1.4 million users at that point.

535
00:32:38,904 --> 00:32:44,991
[SPEAKER_03]: This growth rate, by the way, would be the equivalent of one new Xbox Live member every 30 seconds.

536
00:32:45,792 --> 00:32:47,013
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kind of surprised that

537
00:32:48,868 --> 00:32:50,688
[SPEAKER_03]: Xbox Live is still growing so rapidly.

538
00:32:50,728 --> 00:32:52,849
[SPEAKER_03]: But I guess Halo 2 has a large part to do with that.

539
00:32:52,869 --> 00:32:57,292
[SPEAKER_03]: But it just doesn't seem like there's been a whole lot of... The hype of the 360.

540
00:32:58,012 --> 00:33:02,434
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, some of the new games include the free two-month trial as well.

541
00:33:02,794 --> 00:33:05,816
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, Abident Rising had two-month trial in it.

542
00:33:05,876 --> 00:33:06,556
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I could see that.

543
00:33:06,576 --> 00:33:11,718
[SPEAKER_03]: And plus, with the console coming down in price, it makes Xbox... Like, I didn't buy Xbox when it was first out.

544
00:33:11,758 --> 00:33:14,860
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't until they slashed them to $200 when I finally decided to pick one up.

545
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,722
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess that helps kind of motivate sales as well.

546
00:33:18,222 --> 00:33:18,783
[SPEAKER_03]: Very interesting.

547
00:33:19,903 --> 00:33:27,709
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, also in this article, the company mentions what titles are going to be out for Xbox Live and Xbox 360 Live that will be out before the end of the year.

548
00:33:28,469 --> 00:33:39,297
[SPEAKER_03]: Online playable titles for Xbox 360 include Perfect Dark Zero, Project Gotham Racing 3, Madden NFL 06, Dead or Alive 4, and Call of Duty 2.

549
00:33:40,598 --> 00:33:43,740
[SPEAKER_03]: Some games for the current Xbox that will be enabled on Xbox Live

550
00:33:44,085 --> 00:33:50,032
[SPEAKER_03]: Star Wars Battlefront 2, Tony Hawk American Wasteland, Battlefield 2, Modern Combat.

551
00:33:50,072 --> 00:33:54,657
[SPEAKER_03]: So for those Xbox fans, a lot of sequels in there, so some games to look forward to.

552
00:33:55,338 --> 00:33:56,519
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Dead or Alive will be cool.

553
00:33:56,719 --> 00:33:57,100
[SPEAKER_03]: Dead or Alive 4.

554
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:58,802
[SPEAKER_04]: American Wasteland is going to be pretty cool too.

555
00:33:59,382 --> 00:34:01,705
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like Tony Hawk Underground, but free roaming.

556
00:34:02,246 --> 00:34:02,406
[SPEAKER_03]: It's

557
00:34:03,139 --> 00:34:04,000
[SPEAKER_03]: All one huge level.

558
00:34:04,341 --> 00:34:06,705
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of those clips of Dead or Alive 4, though, look so great.

559
00:34:06,725 --> 00:34:10,933
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've not usually been a really huge Dead or Alive fan, but Dead or Alive 4 looked pretty hot.

560
00:34:10,953 --> 00:34:12,596
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to see the Dead or Alive movie.

561
00:34:13,518 --> 00:34:13,818
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

562
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:15,301
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on.

563
00:34:16,423 --> 00:34:19,745
[SPEAKER_03]: Also another game being teased this week, Resident Evil 5.

564
00:34:20,726 --> 00:34:29,051
[SPEAKER_03]: The website Gamefront had some scans of the publication, Famitsu, which gave some news this week on Resident Evil 5.

565
00:34:29,111 --> 00:34:34,854
[SPEAKER_03]: The interesting thing about Resident Evil 5, remember how Resident Evil 4 was GameCube only, at least in the beginning?

566
00:34:35,295 --> 00:34:40,938
[SPEAKER_03]: Resident Evil 5 will only be on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 when it first comes out.

567
00:34:41,218 --> 00:34:42,459
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo's getting the shaft.

568
00:34:42,759 --> 00:34:45,961
[SPEAKER_03]: But I say this is because Nintendo is being so secretive with their revolutions.

569
00:34:46,021 --> 00:34:47,582
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, because they haven't released their system yet.

570
00:34:47,602 --> 00:34:50,502
[SPEAKER_03]: The system's like, uh... It'll come out sometime.

571
00:34:50,903 --> 00:35:04,607
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a feeling Resident Evil 5 will make its way to the Revolution, but because Nintendo is releasing it later... Well, honestly, I haven't even heard if the Nintendo Revolution dev kits have even gone out yet, so... Well, you can't really make a game without that, so... Well...

572
00:35:05,548 --> 00:35:06,229
[SPEAKER_03]: Very interesting.

573
00:35:06,249 --> 00:35:07,790
[SPEAKER_04]: They also have the trailer up for this, too.

574
00:35:08,051 --> 00:35:08,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Looked pretty cool.

575
00:35:09,332 --> 00:35:18,460
[SPEAKER_03]: Speculation from the early screenshots say that Chris Redfield, who was in Resident Evil 1 and Code Veronica, looks to be the main character in this next game.

576
00:35:19,361 --> 00:35:26,728
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like the over-the-shoulder style from Resident Evil 4 will be coming back in this game as well, at least in some way.

577
00:35:27,389 --> 00:35:30,932
[SPEAKER_03]: But what was surprising from the early screenshots, the game appears to be a little brighter.

578
00:35:32,008 --> 00:35:32,949
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

579
00:35:52,602 --> 00:35:54,103
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

580
00:36:21,352 --> 00:36:33,448
[SPEAKER_00]: Acetaminophen can cause liver damage in conjunction with alcohol, Ibuprofen can cause severe stomach irritation, and Aspirin thins the blood, which may exacerbate hangover.

581
00:36:33,828 --> 00:36:34,950
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry again for talking too fast.

582
00:36:35,849 --> 00:36:36,870
[SPEAKER_00]: 2.

583
00:36:35,909 --> 00:36:36,870
[SPEAKER_00]: Drink a lot of fluids.

584
00:36:36,930 --> 00:36:40,672
[SPEAKER_00]: Dehydration from alcohol can be treated with water, sweet juices, or sports drinks.

585
00:36:41,413 --> 00:36:45,055
[SPEAKER_00]: Potassium also helps you overcome shaky feeling of a bad hangover.

586
00:36:45,075 --> 00:36:45,055
3.

587
00:36:46,256 --> 00:36:46,937
[SPEAKER_00]: Take vitamins.

588
00:36:47,037 --> 00:36:50,959
[SPEAKER_00]: A good multivitamin or vitamin B complex can be used to combat vitamin depletion.

589
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,861
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you drink, vitamin B is the first thing to go.

590
00:36:55,242 --> 00:36:53,861
4.

591
00:36:55,523 --> 00:36:56,363
[SPEAKER_00]: Eat starchy food.

592
00:36:56,443 --> 00:36:58,104
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of it.

593
00:36:58,124 --> 00:36:58,104
5.

594
00:36:58,525 --> 00:37:00,566
[SPEAKER_00]: Rest or sleep for as long as possible.

595
00:37:01,647 --> 00:37:00,566
6.

596
00:37:01,867 --> 00:37:04,689
[SPEAKER_00]: Repeat steps 2 through 5 if you wake up with a hangover.

597
00:37:05,433 --> 00:37:10,696
[SPEAKER_00]: But my number one bit of advice on how to sober up fast, don't go to any Rob's parties.

598
00:37:13,158 --> 00:37:16,640
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't use the double shot glass to make double shot drinks.

599
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:17,721
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, guys.

600
00:37:17,741 --> 00:37:18,521
[SPEAKER_03]: Appreciate your support.

601
00:37:19,261 --> 00:37:19,602
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

602
00:37:20,842 --> 00:37:21,263
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

603
00:37:21,283 --> 00:37:23,164
[SPEAKER_03]: Just for that, you get a story about UE Bowl.

604
00:37:24,365 --> 00:37:25,005
[SPEAKER_03]: Just for that.

605
00:37:26,246 --> 00:37:28,808
[SPEAKER_03]: Dungeon Siege is the next movie that's going to be coming out.

606
00:37:29,228 --> 00:37:32,790
[SPEAKER_03]: Ray Liotta was just signed for Dungeon Siege the movie.

607
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:35,372
[SPEAKER_03]: He'll be playing a villainous character in the game.

608
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:36,713
[SPEAKER_03]: That's his title.

609
00:37:37,894 --> 00:37:40,195
[SPEAKER_03]: Die, villainous character, die.

610
00:37:40,315 --> 00:37:43,317
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't the name of the main character Farmer or something like that?

611
00:37:44,658 --> 00:37:45,479
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of dorky.

612
00:37:46,179 --> 00:37:50,722
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be like what in the Trogdor game, Peasant's Quest.

613
00:37:51,803 --> 00:37:52,984
[SPEAKER_03]: That's enough about Yui Bol.

614
00:37:53,364 --> 00:37:55,065
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, what's going on in the hack and crack scene?

615
00:37:55,586 --> 00:37:59,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there's some interesting stuff that should put a damper on the homebrew scene.

616
00:38:00,168 --> 00:38:09,593
[SPEAKER_04]: PSP Firmware 2.0 was announced at the PlayStation Conference just this week, and PlayStation 2.0 will be adding the elusive internet browser.

617
00:38:09,673 --> 00:38:13,235
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right, folks, you can actually build a browsing internet without having to have Wipeout.

618
00:38:13,535 --> 00:38:14,436
[SPEAKER_03]: So, let me think.

619
00:38:14,596 --> 00:38:22,940
[SPEAKER_03]: Sony realized that people were hacking their way into getting a web browser, so they thought, gee, a good idea to curb this would be to just release our own web browser.

620
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:23,520
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura

621
00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:43,491
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

622
00:38:56,633 --> 00:39:00,515
[SPEAKER_04]: Download our podcast without having to do anything special.

623
00:39:01,015 --> 00:39:02,796
[SPEAKER_04]: Find a Wi-Fi spot, download podcast.

624
00:39:02,917 --> 00:39:03,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Go!

625
00:39:03,337 --> 00:39:04,057
[SPEAKER_04]: Very interesting.

626
00:39:04,077 --> 00:39:07,999
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, an iPod-er for the PSP would be cool.

627
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,000
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool.

628
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:13,182
[SPEAKER_03]: What I'm wondering, is this only in Japan or is this actually going to happen here, the TV thing?

629
00:39:13,703 --> 00:39:15,644
[SPEAKER_04]: The TV thing right now I think is only in Japan.

630
00:39:15,764 --> 00:39:19,326
[SPEAKER_04]: The version 2.0 is supposed to launch in Japan on July 27th.

631
00:39:20,186 --> 00:39:20,726
[SPEAKER_04]: So next week.

632
00:39:21,247 --> 00:39:28,910
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, they're going to be launching a brand new color PSP, white, which is coming out September 21st.

633
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:29,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Virginal white.

634
00:39:30,811 --> 00:39:31,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Ceramic white.

635
00:39:31,812 --> 00:39:32,292
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.

636
00:39:32,612 --> 00:39:33,993
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's going to be coming out.

637
00:39:34,073 --> 00:39:36,874
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be with firmware 2.0 on there.

638
00:39:37,294 --> 00:39:41,156
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can't run the homebrew games, but you've got an internet browser.

639
00:39:41,596 --> 00:39:43,818
[SPEAKER_03]: But how long before they hack the 2.0, you think?

640
00:39:44,878 --> 00:39:45,518
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's gone.

641
00:39:45,598 --> 00:39:51,541
[SPEAKER_04]: What they're going to do is they're going to take the firmware update, rip the browser right out of there, and it'll be in there.

642
00:39:52,641 --> 00:40:01,345
[SPEAKER_04]: New applications are coming along, though, because they accidentally revealed Firmware 2.0 on the internet, and some people downloaded it, and it crashed their PSPs.

643
00:40:02,145 --> 00:40:06,587
[SPEAKER_04]: But they're going to be having a calculator, a word processor, and I think a day planner.

644
00:40:06,767 --> 00:40:08,167
[SPEAKER_03]: A word processor on your PSP?

645
00:40:08,187 --> 00:40:09,308
[SPEAKER_04]: Word processor.

646
00:40:10,157 --> 00:40:13,318
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the thing is... That means there has to be a keyboard attachment coming out.

647
00:40:13,338 --> 00:40:14,938
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's what I was just about to say.

648
00:40:15,018 --> 00:40:21,660
[SPEAKER_04]: Keyboard support is now being added with the PSP, I think via their IR or a USB adapter type thing.

649
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:23,621
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's going to be a PSP keyboard coming out.

650
00:40:23,941 --> 00:40:26,582
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so that's all the wonderful official stuff that's going on.

651
00:40:26,622 --> 00:40:29,623
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, we don't really want to know about the official stuff.

652
00:40:29,663 --> 00:40:33,084
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to talk about... Well, I found the official stuff to be interesting, for one.

653
00:40:33,144 --> 00:40:34,024
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, fine.

654
00:40:34,084 --> 00:40:35,184
[SPEAKER_04]: Talk about the unofficial stuff.

655
00:40:35,204 --> 00:40:36,024
[SPEAKER_04]: The unofficial stuff.

656
00:40:36,665 --> 00:40:37,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Brand new loaders have been...

657
00:40:39,265 --> 00:40:43,768
[SPEAKER_04]: We are back group has released another loader.

658
00:40:43,828 --> 00:40:56,094
[SPEAKER_04]: These ones bypassing the update checks and now running over clock stuff and running the full library files so you can have all this wonderful Wi-Fi and music and everything.

659
00:40:57,463 --> 00:41:01,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Only a matter of time before 3.0 comes out and everything runs.

660
00:41:01,905 --> 00:41:02,745
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not going to matter anymore.

661
00:41:03,466 --> 00:41:05,386
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just thought I'd mention that.

662
00:41:05,566 --> 00:41:08,388
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, upgrades to your favorite emulators.

663
00:41:08,888 --> 00:41:11,549
[SPEAKER_04]: Super Nintendo 9X is now running almost full speed.

664
00:41:12,209 --> 00:41:13,090
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, I gotta check that out.

665
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:14,430
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's really awesome.

666
00:41:14,450 --> 00:41:15,931
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, for research purposes only.

667
00:41:16,251 --> 00:41:18,492
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, homebrew stuff I don't think is a problem, but anyways.

668
00:41:18,912 --> 00:41:22,333
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll check it out for playing Seiken Densetsu 3 on the PSP.

669
00:41:23,114 --> 00:41:23,574
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

670
00:41:23,754 --> 00:41:25,555
[SPEAKER_04]: And my personal favorite, the

671
00:41:26,562 --> 00:41:54,303
[SPEAKER_04]: Scum version 3.0 or version 3's come out which can run Monkey Island and stuff so if you have the old Monkey Island game like I do I have a CD somewhere out there for it I can copy it over and play it on my PSP and Loom I love Loom I was playing this one though called I don't remember what it's called the initials are B-A-S-S anyways it was an okay game but it ran really well I was surprised for emulating a PC game runs great

672
00:41:54,718 --> 00:41:56,159
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I found my copy of Loom.

673
00:41:57,139 --> 00:41:57,359
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

674
00:41:57,379 --> 00:41:58,620
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to install it and play it.

675
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:01,201
[SPEAKER_03]: Was Maniac Mansion on that same software?

676
00:42:02,802 --> 00:42:04,002
[SPEAKER_04]: The Day of the Tentacle was.

677
00:42:04,362 --> 00:42:05,403
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, that's where I'm getting confused.

678
00:42:05,443 --> 00:42:06,003
[SPEAKER_03]: Day of the Tentacle was.

679
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:07,944
[SPEAKER_04]: But Maniac Mansion played on the NES emulator.

680
00:42:08,364 --> 00:42:08,724
[SPEAKER_03]: Good point.

681
00:42:09,144 --> 00:42:13,266
[SPEAKER_04]: And finally, the last thing I'd say is PSP Paint version 3 is out.

682
00:42:13,506 --> 00:42:16,408
[SPEAKER_04]: So I made a cool little picture and it's not really good.

683
00:42:16,428 --> 00:42:17,568
[SPEAKER_04]: But you can save your pictures now.

684
00:42:17,768 --> 00:42:21,930
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I saw your lovely interpretation of Grand Theft Auto that you had painted in there.

685
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:23,591
[SPEAKER_03]: GTA made me kill.

686
00:42:24,662 --> 00:42:25,042
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

687
00:42:25,803 --> 00:42:29,865
[SPEAKER_03]: One more story for you guys tonight, and it has to do with the resurrection of Acclaim.

688
00:42:29,925 --> 00:42:34,708
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, somebody is going to be zombifying Acclaim by injecting it full of Worcester sauce.

689
00:42:34,788 --> 00:42:34,929
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

690
00:42:35,449 --> 00:42:41,733
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, what's going to be happening is that Central Investment Holdings is trying to sell the rights.

691
00:42:42,936 --> 00:42:43,997
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

692
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:06,857
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura

693
00:43:35,312 --> 00:43:36,412
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.

694
00:43:36,972 --> 00:43:37,833
[SPEAKER_00]: Reject false icons.

695
00:43:38,773 --> 00:43:42,115
[SPEAKER_03]: My final thought is, you are the ones who are the ball lickers.

696
00:43:44,156 --> 00:43:47,157
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was the little poster that made a cameo appearance in the news article.

697
00:43:47,797 --> 00:43:51,799
[SPEAKER_03]: What was blurred out like the genitalia on a sim?

698
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:53,720
[SPEAKER_03]: Good night, everybody.

699
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:56,001
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see you next time on the Orange Lounge Radio to-go edition.

700
00:43:57,492 --> 00:44:01,080
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the end of another Orange Lounge Radio To Go edition.

701
00:44:01,381 --> 00:44:06,913
[SPEAKER_02]: This podcast is a proud part of www.orangeloungeradio.com.

702
00:44:07,394 --> 00:44:08,376
[SPEAKER_02]: See you next update.
