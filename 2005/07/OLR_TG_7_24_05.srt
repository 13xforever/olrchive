Yeah!

37
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:32,380
I laughed.

38
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,380
Anyway, yeah, you laughed and you called me.

39
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:34,380
Oh, you're an idiot.

40
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,380
They made me look like a dumbass on TV.

41
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:36,380
That's funny.

42
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,700
And I watched and I'm like, huh?

43
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,700
What the hell?

44
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,700
Yeah, buddy.

45
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,580
Loki, what have you been up to this week, game-wise?

46
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:48,300
Besides gawking at the TV, I've been playing Intelligent License, which is yet another

47
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:52,560
Japanese PSP game. It's, um, for those who might remember back in, I think it was

48
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,700
PlayStation, um, Intelligent Cube, where you, like, heck yeah, I remember how Intelligent Cube,

49
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:00,220
like, it was awesome. Where you, like, dodge cubes or something. I can't remember that game too

50
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:03,720
well, but I did play it. You, you run around this big field, basically, and these

51
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:07,900
cubes are slowly rolling at you, and you have to trap cubes, basically. You, you,

52
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:11,180
it's like a puzzle game. You lay a green square on the ground, and you can pull a

53
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:15,980
cube, but you can only do certain ones. Like, you don't want to pull the black

54
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:20,140
cubes and then there are certain ones that will cause chain reactions but you

55
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:24,060
only have so many cubes you can pull before they roll you over that's the

56
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:27,540
whole puzzle so you have to use the multi trap cubes. The whole point of that

57
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:31,540
game I think was to test your intelligence and this is more the same

58
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:35,900
this game that reminds me of the VR missions from Metal Gear Solid because

59
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:40,400
it's very similar that you have to like you know go through mazes you have to

60
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,580
dodge like people with like these security guards with flashlights and

61
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:47,420
and whatnot. It's very similar to Metal Gear Solid VR missions.

62
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:50,260
Does it seem to have anything in common with the original Intelligent Cube at all?

63
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:53,820
It sorta looks the same, but other than that, no.

64
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:56,700
Does it have, like, orchestra music? Because I remember Intelligent Cube had a very

65
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,340
strange soundtrack. It was like all this, like,

66
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:01,860
big orchestra music. Yeah, it's got pretty good music in it, so it's decent.

67
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,900
More of the same, but I've been playing that a lot,

68
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:08,660
and then, what was it, just recently I've been playing peek-a-boo poker

69
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:13,980
on the Nintendo emulator which is

70
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:17,940
one of the like three adult games for the

71
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:21,580
Nintendo Entertainment System and it's very

72
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:25,180
very craptastic but it's by the same people that did Bubble Bath Babes

73
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:29,500
Bubble Bath Babes and Hot Slots so I have all three of those

74
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:34,200
There are some winning games right there. I remember seeing Bubble Bath Babes back in the day in a

75
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,340
rental store and I was like

76
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:38,480
I'm gonna play that someday and I did and I was disappointed

77
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,900
But then I played killer seven I progressed through another two levels and there's these one

78
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:50,840
Smile heaven smile things you have to attack they have t-shirts and it's cool because you can just shoot them then they have like giant

79
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:54,560
Smile, it's just this game right now. I thought you know progressing through it

80
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,880
I'd figure out what's going on

81
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:01,020
But the more and more I progress through the game the less and less I understand what's going on, but it's still fun

82
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,020
I so I'm playing through it still

83
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:06,780
All right, very cool anything else that's it. All right my gaming week

84
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:10,540
I just got I mentioned this very briefly at the last at the end of the last podcast

85
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:14,100
I just got a new television because my old one the

86
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:19,140
RCA yellow thing was coming loose like and so my video kept fading in and out

87
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:25,300
So I just finally decided to upgrade my TV and I went over to a big warehouse type store

88
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:30,700
And I bought a 30 inch HD TV widescreen. So now I'm all about the widescreen games

89
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:34,660
I'm like oh, I got to go back and play all these games because they're gonna look pretty and widescreen

90
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:41,140
I got to find the ones have the good graphics, so I thought okay. I'm gonna play Halo 2. That's that's a very pretty looking game

91
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:45,540
So I got on Halo 2 and I've been downloading the new maps and checking them out

92
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:51,300
And I also got on and decided to play on Xbox Live again because they've been doing all these updates to the game lately

93
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:55,500
So I thought I'd see if it played any differently and for someone like me who is a casual Halo 2 gamer

94
00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:00,540
I can't tell there's been any differences at all except for the new maps and the new maps you good idea keeps the game fresh

95
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:06,580
So that's good. Um, one thing I did realize however, is that I am the worst Halo 2 player on the entire internet

96
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:12,240
Seriously, I'm horrible. I've played several games and my ranking hasn't budged. That's how bad I am

97
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:16,940
So if you ever see me in playing a Halo 2 match

98
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:20,520
Feel free to make fun of me because I really am that bad at Halo 2. I apologize

99
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:24,340
Other than that, I'm not I've just been playing kind of a lot of older games

100
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:30,180
Just kind of rediscovering things and widescreen just playing with Xbox and going. Oh, I didn't know this game supported widescreen

101
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:36,100
on all the little geeky techno things so no new games this week otherwise really

102
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:40,540
all right let's get into some gaming news tonight and tonight I want to start

103
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:44,100
off actually I should mention since I was talking about Halo 2 there actually

104
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:49,340
was a new Halo 2 update this week they're calling it the ban hammer update

105
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:54,260
basically what they're doing is that they are updating the game because there

106
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:58,440
have been people that have been trying to mod Halo 2 and they can basically

107
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:02,880
jump over ships pass through walls become invisible when you're not

108
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,140
supposed to it's basically the same old thing people trying to hack the game

109
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:09,000
that you're not supposed to is they can play online are they putting a sex

110
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,500
minigame in Taylor no there was they were not hacking halo 2 to put a sex

111
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:17,260
minigame in it but they were pissing off the people at bungee so they decided

112
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:21,660
that hey we're gonna put this new patch out there and you're required to

113
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:25,500
download it if you want to play online and I noticed this when I was playing

114
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:31,140
Halo 2 online they've really started putting all these messages in the game that says hey like like, you know

115
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:34,280
When you're waiting to join why I know you don't because you don't play Halo 2 Loki

116
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,720
But when you're waiting to join a match on

117
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:42,960
Halo 2 you get these little messages think of it as like the tip of the day like whenever you start a program like Photoshop

118
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,900
You always get the tip of the day. We catch you cheating. You'll be dead

119
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:51,580
That's basically what they've changed it to now. They have these little messages that go by they have the useful tips as well

120
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,940
but then they have these things that go by going if

121
00:07:53,940 --> 00:08:00,280
cheating is not honored around here and we will ban your ass type things you

122
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,480
know obviously they don't use that kind of language but you get the idea they're

123
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,360
trying to put these little public service announcements that you know we

124
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:10,300
catch you we ban you type things so they're just trying to curb the people

125
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:14,720
that feel like they have to cheat to get ahead in Halo 2 because you know being

126
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,600
the number one person on the Halo 2 leaderboard apparently wins you all this

127
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:23,600
type of fame and fortune and all this stuff so every kid wants to be it I

128
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,400
I don't know. I don't understand. Why would somebody want to cheat on Halo 2?

129
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:31,440
It's fun. Just to get ahead. Nothing better to do. It's fun to get away with it.

130
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:36,000
They use the internet for self-validation. Just like people in Final Fantasy 11 who are

131
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,280
like teleporting themselves around. We have people on our link show to do that actually.

132
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:44,400
Speaking of Final Fantasy 11, maybe for not much longer because they actually

133
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,880
had a patch this week.

134
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:49,160
Their patch actually had a little something to do with Chains of Promathia.

135
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,120
They actually added

136
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:53,480
a little more to the story in Chains of Promathia and they added some more

137
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,760
uh... bosses so basically they're trying to wrap up the storyline there

138
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:00,760
forty-three megabyte download for pc users is pretty big that's what i've

139
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:04,920
quit that day i want to quit raining on the hunt for us to our parades

140
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,560
what did you start playing again

141
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,560
i'm thinking about it

142
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:11,720
no no use i have here so with me i haven't played in a month miss none in a

143
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:15,620
pia so i'm thinking about but i don't want to match

144
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:17,760
yet but you have played again haven't played a month

145
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,000
because uh...

146
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,760
i

147
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,920
the what the woman is uh... yelling at me

148
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:26,180
with too much computer use she was comparing the computer to a woman today

149
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:28,100
so I was like

150
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,920
okay probably can't stay up and play Final Fantasy late

151
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,860
well one thing that'll make the Final Fantasy fans happy this is actually

152
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,400
something that made me happy because I've been waiting for them to do this for a

153
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:41,400
long time and it is something that is making me consider going back but

154
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,640
I'm not making any decisions until my work trips over next month but

155
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,720
what they did is that they are going to uh...

156
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,000
have some of these

157
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,400
items that were selling for tons and tons of guild the leaping boots the

158
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:57,680
Emperor's Hairpin now they're rare EX items so Gill sellers can't camp them

159
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,640
anymore for Gill so of course they'll find other ways to make their money with

160
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:05,280
the Gill selling but they're trying to at least curb that a little bit so very

161
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:10,200
interesting by the way Squeenix what we call Square Enix they recently

162
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:15,560
registered a brand new trademark it's called treasures of Ot Urgen hmm maybe a

163
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:19,740
new Final Fantasy 11 expansion who knows there was actually two names that were

164
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:23,820
registered no I didn't see the second one I heard that one I can't remember

165
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:28,140
the other one hmm I'll have to look at it all right well either way rumors

166
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:31,740
going around that with the Xbox 360 release we're gonna see a new expansion

167
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:39,940
pack anyway so all right yeah yeah yeah cut it out all right let's open up the

168
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:43,460
old mailbag we'll get into something dark Sakura might be interested in we'll

169
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:47,660
go to the mailbag because lots of good ones we got some good mail this week in

170
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:53,420
mailbag so I got more than what I actually boarded do you want to start

171
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:56,520
off by reading one then or you want me to go to one go ahead all right I'm

172
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:02,960
gonna start it off with an email this one came in from Rob Rob wanted to

173
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:06,140
follow up with something that we were saying about the Silent Hill last week

174
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:09,620
we're talking about Silent Hill for last week and somebody had been dogging on

175
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:14,180
Silent Hill 3 I don't remember no you like Silent Hill 3 right dark soccer I

176
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:17,620
think it might have been our emailer was dogging on it but Rob wanted to say that

177
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:24,520
the PC version of Silent Hill 3 is a kazillion CDs but it's only $9.99 best of

178
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:28,420
all it contains the Silent Hill 3 soundtrack I bought the soundtrack and

179
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:33,520
got a game for free it's a good way to check it check both out so my response

180
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:39,240
to him was if you buy Silent Hill 3 for the PlayStation 2 you get the soundtrack

181
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:44,000
really yes but for PC it's only 10 bucks so how much is it on ps2 right now it's

182
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,480
It's got to be at least a great chance, right?

183
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:51,220
So either way, I like that when they throw in those bonuses like the soundtrack and things

184
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,760
to get you to check the game out.

185
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,360
That is pretty cool.

186
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:59,960
And I just mentioned the other name that was out there, the Square Enix, registered was

187
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,580
Scars of War.

188
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:02,680
Thank you.

189
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,680
That could be its own game though, probably.

190
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:13,240
I also got another one from him, talking about how he was in Toys R Us the other day, and

191
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:19,200
a six-year-old could understand that an M-rated game was for a teen and not for

192
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,560
the kid but parents don't seem to understand that mm-hmm I think that's

193
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:27,680
pretty funny in a very sad way yeah in a very sad way that the six-year-old

194
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:32,520
understands the ratings better than his parents certainly I wanted to read

195
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:38,080
another email here that came from let's see who is this person the brain trust

196
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:41,880
was the person that sent this email and he was actually talking about the hot

197
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:46,820
Coffee Mod, he talked a lot about that in the beginning of his email and he had an interesting

198
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:53,320
perspective on that basically that he thought that video games overdo it sometimes.

199
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,820
Like games like Manhunt, they overdo it and probably shouldn't even be made because they

200
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:00,060
just overdo it basically.

201
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:03,300
But what I thought was interesting is at the end of his email he said, he was listening

202
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:07,920
to a podcast that we did on July 4th and we were commenting on the Left Behind game.

203
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,080
He said, although I don't know if it will be a good game and don't care, although the

204
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:14,320
premise has potential just to let you know the Christian community isn't all

205
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,440
stupid in fact I don't know any Christians with a feeling that all games

206
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:22,360
are evil the out-of-touch Christian stereotype doesn't fit anymore and you

207
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:28,240
know that to the fundamentalists to that I say you know you're right I mean in

208
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,440
when we are kind of poking fun at the whole thing and we're saying you know

209
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:36,280
oh that the Christians think that these games are evil I'd like to think that

210
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:41,440
that usually we preface it by saying that it's the extremist we're talking about in

211
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,440
this case.

212
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,280
The ones who actually publicly make the complaint.

213
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,720
The 700 Club.

214
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:50,520
Not every Christian is a crazy, foaming at the mouth, like crazy, I'm gonna ban games.

215
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:57,000
Like the morons behind the chick tracks, you know, whoever has succeeded Jerry Falwell

216
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,400
in his camp, you know, the fundamentalists.

217
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:05,520
And I have some good friends who are Christians and I'm not, you know, I personally am not

218
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:09,200
into that religion, but I have no problem... I went to church today!

219
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:13,840
There you go! Besides, it's now, it's not really hip to make fun of Christian

220
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,440
people, it's

221
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:18,640
hip to make fun of Scientology. Oh yeah, that's true, we have a new religion to be making fun of.

222
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:22,140
It's always been funny to make fun of Scientology. In all seriousness, and you can say this about

223
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:26,040
any group of people, whether it be a religious group, an ethnic group,

224
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:30,800
a, I don't know, whatever you come up with, a group of anybody, gamers even,

225
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:35,000
there's always a few bad apples that ruin it for everyone. So when we poke fun,

226
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,160
we're only poking fun at the extremists obviously there's plenty of great

227
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:42,920
Christian folks I have friends that are Christians just like I have friends that

228
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:46,760
are Buddhists and friends that are other religions and the great thing about the

229
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:51,000
country where we live in playing the play the anthem is that you can have

230
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,840
freedom of religion and choice and all that good enough for much longer

231
00:14:55,840 --> 00:15:00,600
yeah free remember the government voting in those conservatives that'll be gone

232
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:04,000
real quick don't start the political thing or we're gonna get tons I'm not

233
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,840
I'm not I'm not alright out Fox last night

234
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,840
You got another email you want to read dark Sakura. I lost my place

235
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,220
All right, I got another one then if you don't have one

236
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:19,980
I wanted to read this one. This is cool. This was from a guy named Chris

237
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:24,720
And he actually works on a site called a society wild card

238
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:30,080
wants to say I wanted to thank you guys for providing an excellent entertaining and informative podcast

239
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:34,160
amongst the mediocrity and crap that is swimming out there in the podcast ocean

240
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,300
that's quite a compliment thank you no that's very cool no way to be talking

241
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:42,720
about governor Schwarzenegger's podcast be nice I'm a filmmaker out here in

242
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,940
Tampa Florida and I found the show while I was looking through podcast alley back

243
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:48,940
in June and I've been listening ever since you know something weird about

244
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:53,060
podcast alley it's not picking up our more recent shows ever since we went on

245
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:57,940
to iTunes I'm not sure what's going on with that but I emailed them so please

246
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:58,780
um...

247
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:03,180
make sure you subscribe to the show via itunes or via ipod or some other form

248
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:07,180
don't rely on necessarily uh... podcast alley

249
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:11,020
although it's a great site i'm not gonna knock podcast is a great site and we

250
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:14,580
have a lot of great people who voted for us over there as well

251
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:18,240
it it's just really really big and they don't have time to work on you know each

252
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,860
little individual podcast and its problems so you know he's given us a

253
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:25,460
plug on his show i think it's only fair to do the same for him absolutely he's

254
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:32,660
got a show you want to do if you go to the Chris show blogspot.com his podcast

255
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:36,560
is available there all right sounds good and he says he's a filmmaker so I just

256
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,100
want you to know that you know if you need a good actor I do all my own nude

257
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:47,020
scenes just you know I have voice acting I have my kick-ass one-liners like

258
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:52,020
podcasting it's so much fun all right you got any more emails for a

259
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:58,180
I'll do one more I know I sent you a bunch I think we got most oh here was

260
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:02,580
another one this here's one I'll read this one this would be the last one this

261
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:07,340
one comes to us from Brian in Michigan and he says he's been listening to the

262
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:12,140
podcast for a few weeks now thank you and he enjoys the discussion and our

263
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:14,840
thoughts on the news that's interesting he likes the fact that we kind of talk

264
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:17,440
about things we don't just kind of report report report so thank you we

265
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:21,600
appreciate that also another vote for the drunken Loki episode he liked that

266
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:28,080
so anyway what do you want it huh one more oh no I wonder I want to say the

267
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:31,280
rest there's another part to this here he's got a suggestion for us how about

268
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,880
some discussion on popular mods for PC games he says I don't think mods get

269
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:39,740
enough air time and there are some great ones out there let's also not forget how

270
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:43,960
many mods have become full games and how many modders have received jobs in the

271
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:47,880
industry a very interesting point I have to admit unfortunately I don't play a

272
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:52,540
a lot of PC games I do the most of my gaming on console not that I don't

273
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:55,500
respect a lot of PC games out there I'm actually really looking forward to

274
00:17:55,500 --> 00:18:00,500
civilization 4 which by the way is supposed to be very mod friendly they're

275
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,500
supposed to be building this whole programming language and they're gonna

276
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:07,340
make it very mod friendly I think that's very cool Loki you would probably know

277
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:10,780
more about the modding thing why don't you talk about the PC mod so much well I

278
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:13,220
don't I don't play a lot of PC games anymore

279
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:17,820
honestly what I've been playing maybe Grand Theft Auto a little bit I have

280
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:22,620
hot coffee mod haven't actually played the hot coffee portion because getting the damn girlfriends

281
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:26,700
to actually understand you and like you know you have to take them out on dates and it's really

282
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:31,980
hard because they want to go do drive-bys and and they end up dying a lot of times they get shot in

283
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:37,100
the head and you're like oh your girlfriend's dead oh damn you know but so i don't do that instead

284
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:41,420
what i do is i download even more mods like the spider car mod where you can drive cars up walls

285
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:46,780
just crazy stuff like actually doing my own modding where you just adjust the aspects of

286
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:48,680
of different cars and stuff.

287
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,960
But there's some pretty cool ones.

288
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:53,360
Like there's one for, I think it was Unreal or whatever,

289
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,880
or Quake, the Enter the Tube or whatever like that,

290
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,400
the Penny Arcade mod that they had for that,

291
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,500
that was pretty cool.

292
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,120
Just, there's a lot of mods out there,

293
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,760
but unfortunately, you know, I don't play a lot of them.

294
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,200
It's just not in the budget for us

295
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,920
to be getting a lot of PC games.

296
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:13,000
The last mod I ever did was Gatchamon Quake.

297
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Now, Quake was almost ten years ago, so it's old.

298
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Quake Rally, where they turn that game into a racing game.

299
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
But some of those like that get adopted and get huge followings to them.

300
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
If any game publishers out there want to send us some

301
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
free games, and we will definitely look into how the internet is modding your game on the PC,

302
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
we'll certainly talk about it on the show. Drop us an email, togo

303
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
togo.com, and you should do that anyway if you have

304
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,440
any general comments on the show you got one more email for us we had one from

305
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:49,480
someone named Spencer just talking about the music games one of our opinions on

306
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:54,680
rocks or red octane mad cats and he's a apparently an indigo fan but I have to

307
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:57,480
say that if you really want our true opinion on the music games you should

308
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:01,200
probably check out our live show that's true we do do talk about it for three

309
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:06,140
hours well that's kind of a loose term that we are a train wreck we talk

310
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:10,080
strictly about the music games we do do a live show on orange launch radio.com

311
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:15,840
For three hours every Sunday night and you can hear Loki really rip on in a groove because he doesn't care for the game

312
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,160
and I will

313
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:23,240
Second that because in the groove is kind of but I I on the other hand. I'm not bothered by in the groove

314
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:27,880
I think it does some good things for the dance game community for those who don't know what in the groove is

315
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:35,000
It's kind of controversial in the music game scene because it was a game that look it was made by fans of dance dance revolution

316
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,280
who were sad to see the Dance Dance Revolution stopped in Japan with the

317
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:43,160
release of Dance Dance Revolution Extreme a couple years ago so they made

318
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:48,600
their own game that had some new ideas some original music etc but it's kind of

319
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,560
one of those things that got really you want to talk about mods to get blown out

320
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:55,080
of proportion this was something that got way way way too big and now it has a

321
00:20:55,080 --> 00:21:02,320
home release and it's so basically it's just very controversial I like in the

322
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:06,040
groove somewhat I like some of the things that it brings to the table like

323
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:10,180
I like some of some of the music in the game I think mines when used

324
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:14,320
appropriately is an interesting new twist on the dance game but there's a

325
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,580
lot of things I don't like about it and a lot of it has to do with the online

326
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:22,000
community I hate to say it I but I just really hope you're not one of these guys

327
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,660
that's online saying you know oh DDR is dead and DDR sucks because in the groove

328
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:32,940
owns everything. Okay, In the Groove does one-up DDR on some things, but they will

329
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:36,260
not have existed without DDR. Yeah, we have to can't forget that In the Groove

330
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:41,020
would not exist without DDR, and the fact that DDR is not dead, it's got plenty of

331
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:45,180
home releases still coming out, including Xtreme 2, UltraMix 3 coming out later

332
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:48,460
this year. And again, not to dog on the scene as a whole, because I know some

333
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:51,500
really nice people in the In the Groove scene, but just some of the message

334
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:57,060
boards really ruffle my feathers. I too got an email, but it was something

335
00:21:57,060 --> 00:22:04,940
funny, it was referring back to the episode in which I mentioned how games help the kids,

336
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:10,620
you know, fight with diseases, and I mentioned Tumor Raider, and someone sent me a Clarisworks

337
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:15,540
file, and if I remember correctly, I think Clarisworks is a Mac, you know, it's something

338
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:21,340
that runs on an Apple PC, fortunately I do not, you know, I do not have such inferior

339
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,340
PCs.

340
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,980
And we're not even going into this next story.

341
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:26,700
Not start the Apple versus PC thing again.

342
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:30,700
Because we do not need to hear the closed-minded speak out of his ass.

343
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,700
Alright.

344
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:33,700
Moving on.

345
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,700
Hey, I have some fun news.

346
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:35,700
You have a fun news?

347
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:36,700
What do you want to tell us about?

348
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:37,700
Not really fun.

349
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:38,700
It's really depressing.

350
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:39,700
Alright.

351
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,700
Can we play the happy music again?

352
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:42,700
Yeah.

353
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,700
No.

354
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:44,700
No.

355
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:45,700
This would be horrible.

356
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,700
Alright.

357
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:47,700
No.

358
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:48,700
Read the story.

359
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,700
Alright.

360
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:50,700
Read the story.

361
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:56,260
A 12-year-old named Gary Lloyd, apparently in London, hung himself.

362
00:22:56,260 --> 00:23:02,220
After his mother took away his Playstation, it turned out to be he was doing it to get

363
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:06,100
attention and his little prank went wrong.

364
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:11,820
So any childrens listening to the show, if your mom takes away your Playstation, don't

365
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:13,460
hang yourself cause you'll die.

366
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:15,460
Yeah, try going outside.

367
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,460
Or do something else.

368
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:21,860
Yeah, there's like a world out there with air and birds and stuff.

369
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:25,500
All he needed was just an extra life.

370
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,500
So wrong.

371
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,500
So wrong.

372
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,500
Wah wah wah.

373
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,500
Boo!

374
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,500
But it is pretty crappy.

375
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,500
Just... kids...

376
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,500
I didn't...

377
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:36,940
Half of me wants to say it's Darwinism at work.

378
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:37,940
Hey.

379
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:38,940
The other half.

380
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:39,940
There's something else going on here.

381
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:40,940
I'll have you know.

382
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:42,500
Grand Theft Auto does not have hangings.

383
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:46,620
Texas does though.

384
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:53,260
Moving on, speaking of Grand Theft Auto and like stories, we have a story about the Miami

385
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:55,100
Attorney Jack Thompson.

386
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:58,100
Maybe you know this guy, he's crazy!

387
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:02,560
He's foaming at the mouth crazy when it comes to wanting to rip video games a new one for

388
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,560
being too violent.

389
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,300
Well guess what game he's going after now?

390
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,300
Sims 2!

391
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:12,140
Yes, he says that naked people in the Sims 2 is just horrible.

392
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:16,860
Here's a quote, Sims 2, the latest version of the Sims video game franchise, contains,

393
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:21,580
according to the video game news sites, full frontal nudity, including nipples, penises,

394
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:22,900
labia, and pubic hair.

395
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,380
Okay, come on, that's pathetic.

396
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:27,580
I just wanted to say all those words on a podcast.

397
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:28,580
No it doesn't.

398
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:32,740
It's the mod that put that on there.

399
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:37,020
I think there's a big, big difference between what's going on here and what's going on with

400
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:38,180
Grand Theft Auto.

401
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:42,580
I call what happened with Grand Theft Auto San Andreas and the whole hot coffee thing

402
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:43,980
lazy programming.

403
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:51,460
The reason being, and we've seen this happen before with DDR, because Dark Soccer Loki

404
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:54,180
myself been talking about DDR for years, so we've been following the

405
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:59,580
franchise, and when it had a release on the PlayStation, its very first release,

406
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:04,460
some hackers found on the disc a background for the song Bad Girls where

407
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:06,580
somebody had airbrushed out the gun.

408
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:10,180
So it makes it look like that they had prepped that song to be ready for US

409
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:11,060
audiences,

410
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:14,940
but they took the song out at the last minute. Or if you even want to go more recent, DDR

411
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:15,700
Extreme,

412
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:19,660
where they had a completely, a song that wasn't even in the game, but you could

413
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:22,940
play that's right you had memories remember that memories is completely in

414
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:26,980
the game and with hack codes you could hack your memory card file to play

415
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:30,460
memories on DDR extreme even though the song wasn't supposed to be there for

416
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:33,900
whatever reason at the last minute they took it out but what do they take out

417
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:37,860
they don't it's a pain in the butt I guess for compiling or whatever reasons

418
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:41,900
I'm not a programmer but it's a pain in the butt to take out the entire chunk of

419
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:46,500
game it's easier to take out the little pointer that points to that file and the

420
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:49,380
Because you know all these games work on a giant flow chart

421
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:52,260
It's easier to take out the pointer that says play this song

422
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:58,260
So that's what I think happened with Grand Theft Auto that Rockstar had every intention of doing this sex thing

423
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:03,160
But at the last minute they somebody thought you know what maybe this is a little much

424
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:05,580
So instead of taking the whole thing out of the game

425
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:10,060
What did they take out they took out the pointer and when the PC version came out?

426
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:12,940
It was exposed that the hot coffee thing was in there

427
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:17,380
somebody put the pointer back in and sure enough PlayStation and Xbox versions

428
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:21,700
the pointers they figure out how to put it back in Rockstar has to admit yes the

429
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:24,780
sex thing was in the game the whole time but they didn't intend on it being

430
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:28,620
discovered and I believe it that they probably had taken the pointers out not

431
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:34,060
realizing it's lazy programming I call it so but now with the Sims that's not

432
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:37,500
you don't have a pointer or at least with the Sims 2 I rumor is in the

433
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:40,500
original Sims I didn't play enough of the Sims but there actually was a code

434
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:44,500
where you could undo the blur or whatever, but it's a patch, it's another mod.

435
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:48,500
But the thing is, is that even under the blur there was no detail.

436
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:51,500
All it is is another skin that has the detail.

437
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:57,500
Right, and even, there was actually a quote, Jeff Brown, Vice President of Corporate Communications at EA says,

438
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:03,500
This is nonsense. We've reviewed 100% of the content. There is no content inappropriate for a teen audience.

439
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:08,500
Players never see a nude sim. If someone with an extreme amount of expertise and time were to remove the pixels,

440
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:12,300
the pixels they would see that the Sims have no genitals they appear like Ken

441
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:15,700
and Barbie what they're talking about though is the nude sim patches where

442
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:19,960
people have actually modified because in The Sims 2 you can actually modify your

443
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:23,860
character and so they added that stuff in but the thing is is and they're this

444
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:27,060
guy's like going oh well they're just letting that happen yeah they want

445
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:32,020
people to make mods so you can make new clothing you can make new items etc

446
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:34,260
because that stuff they have whole communities built around that where you

447
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:37,060
can buy new skins you can make characters that look like Austin Powers

448
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:41,740
On the Sims 2 site themselves, they offer a mod of the month, basically.

449
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:44,940
Right, but they would not highlight a nude patch as the mod of the month.

450
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:45,940
They have that kind of space.

451
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:46,940
Well, no!

452
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:50,220
And they have like houses, you can buy houses and bring them in or whatever.

453
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:52,780
But that same thing's been going on for years.

454
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:53,780
Remember Tomb Raider?

455
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:57,620
They had the nude Laura patch within six months of the game coming out, and where was this

456
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:58,620
guy then?

457
00:27:58,620 --> 00:27:59,620
He doesn't do his research.

458
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:00,660
That's clearly what it is.

459
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:01,740
He doesn't do his research.

460
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:02,940
So take this one to court.

461
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:04,340
They'll just, they're gonna nail you in the ass.

462
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:09,540
I think that's what they're gonna find the difference is and I hope somebody sits down in front of Congress and explain this to them

463
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:13,180
You can't control what the people on the internet are gonna do to the code of the game

464
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:17,580
But in the case of Grand Theft Auto, I think it was a lazy pointer programming thing

465
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:20,860
But even still though even still if that was the case

466
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:27,620
This shouldn't have even gone as far as it was even if it was lazy program because there's been it's stupid. It's really dumb

467
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:31,960
I think all all games are gonna suffer because of this not necessarily content wise but

468
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,120
that programmers aren't gonna be so lazy anymore

469
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,520
and they're gonna push back the release dates

470
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,800
of their games so they can clean up,

471
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,920
clean out the code so you people don't find them.

472
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,320
You know what's gonna suffer?

473
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,580
Pre-expression.

474
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,160
That's what's gonna suffer.

475
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,400
You know, it's kind of funny though

476
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,440
because there are a lot of lazy programmers out there.

477
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,120
There's like, what is it?

478
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,440
One of the Dance Dance Revolution games,

479
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,540
they sometimes, they used to have these things

480
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:54,760
like dummy files that would like,

481
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:57,100
they would put on the disc to fill up space or whatever

482
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:59,500
so it'd make them harder to rip or whatever.

483
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:04,780
One of the Dance Dance Revolution games, I think it was Max 2, had the entire source

484
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:06,940
code for BeatMania 5 on it.

485
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:08,820
Oh, I'd heard about that.

486
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:09,820
It's a zip file.

487
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:12,520
It's like, oh, that was pretty dumb.

488
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:18,300
But there's a lot of lazy programming stuff out there, but just honestly, I don't know

489
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,680
why this is such an issue.

490
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:23,860
But you know what, they want to make this an example just like they made Janet Jackson

491
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:25,540
an example in the whole TV thing.

492
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:28,220
They've got their own agendas, they want some way to do it, and they're going to find a

493
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:29,220
way to do it.

494
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:32,060
The moral movements thing of the week, basically.

495
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,060
It's retarded.

496
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,060
Alright.

497
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,700
More like moral bowel movement.

498
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:40,180
I'm gonna let Dark Soccer get into some UK news, but first I wanted to give a story that's

499
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:43,500
kind of UK related, a little miniature story here.

500
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:46,980
Konami's gonna be publishing a game based on Wallace and Gromit, because they're gonna

501
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:51,740
be having a movie coming out, The Curse of the Were-Rabbit, I actually saw the trailer

502
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:55,380
when I went and saw Charlie and Chocolate Factory again this week.

503
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:58,460
Wallace and Gromit, Konami's gonna be putting out the game, it's going to follow the events

504
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:02,620
of the movie basically the plot is that you know Wallace and his dog gromit are

505
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:08,180
called on to protect a giant vegetable contest from a beastly terror you can

506
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:11,940
use cooperative gameplay in the game playing as Wallace or gromit or their

507
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:16,500
rabbit friend named hutch should be interesting dark soccer what's going on

508
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:20,840
in the UK for our friends overseas well actually this is more of an

509
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:27,500
international thing about hiranobu Sakaguchi you know Final Fantasy creator

510
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:30,840
basically is saying that he's got a couple games

511
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:35,020
in works on the Xbox 360 however they will not be playable at the Tokyo Game

512
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:35,940
Show in September

513
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:39,420
Oh interesting. But

514
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:43,060
they are basically making progress on it

515
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:46,460
they're getting the graphics in order it's just been slow progress

516
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:49,860
Want my Final Fantasy 12 dammit

517
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:52,780
also in news

518
00:30:52,780 --> 00:31:02,180
Archer McLean, he was the creative director at Awesome Studios, they actually were the company that put out Mercury, and he resigned.

519
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:07,780
But said that overall he was really more of a figurehead, so it's not really a major loss.

520
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:14,280
And Loki, your review on Mercury pretty much convinced me not to buy the game, so I guess this is no big loss.

521
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:19,880
It wasn't that great of a game. It was okay, it was sort of different, but I got bored with it really quick.

522
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,480
What could they have done to make the game better?

523
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:27,160
Just, I was expecting something sort of like Marble Madness. The mazes were too short, and it was just very...

524
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:32,840
It was just, a lot of levels that were really short, and it just didn't do it for me. It was just kind of a pain in the butt.

525
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:38,440
Now, the last thing is a game I haven't heard much on, uh, coming out for the US market.

526
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:42,600
I'm sure it will, but it's called Another Code to Memories.

527
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,960
Basically, it's sort of like a combination of, uh,

528
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:50,720
interactive sim you know kind of dating Sims were except you also have a little

529
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,960
map where you guide somebody through a house and your puzzle you have puzzles

530
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,760
to get them through this house so you're using both screens one for your

531
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:02,560
communication with a ghost and the other to navigate so it's supposed to be a

532
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:09,080
little semi survival horror puzzle game it looks pretty cool very cool sounds

533
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,460
That's good.

534
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:13,580
All right, let's move on to some other news

535
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:16,300
talking about Xbox Live.

536
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,980
There was actually a story posted on,

537
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:19,900
I'm not sure if this is Gamasutra.

538
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,420
I always want to say Gamasutra

539
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:23,700
so it can rhyme with the book, you know?

540
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,500
But I think it's Gamasutra.

541
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,100
They ran a story earlier this week

542
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:29,020
that says that Microsoft is announcing

543
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:32,740
two million Xbox Live subscribers.

544
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:34,460
The last time that they had made an announcement

545
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:38,860
was back in January, 1.4 million users at that point.

546
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:43,580
This growth rate, by the way, would be the equivalent of one new Xbox Live member every

547
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:45,660
30 seconds.

548
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:51,580
I'm kind of surprised that Xbox Live is still growing so rapidly, but I guess Halo 2 has

549
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:54,780
a large part to do with that, but it just doesn't seem like there's been a whole lot

550
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:56,380
of really, like, just...

551
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:58,140
The hype of the 360.

552
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:02,820
Also some of the new games include the free two month trial as well.

553
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:05,100
Like Evident Rising had a two month trial in it, so...

554
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,580
Okay, I can see that, I can see that.

555
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:08,920
And plus, with the console coming down in price,

556
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,800
it makes Xbox, like I didn't buy Xbox when it was first out.

557
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,680
It wasn't until they slashed them to 200 bucks

558
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,520
when I finally decided to pick one up.

559
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:18,360
So I guess that helps kinda motivate sales as well.

560
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,880
Very interesting.

561
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,320
By the way, also in this article,

562
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:23,380
the company mentions what titles are gonna be out

563
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:26,000
for Xbox Live and Xbox 360 Live

564
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,360
that will be out before the end of the year.

565
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:31,520
Online playable titles for Xbox 360 include

566
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:35,160
Perfect Dark Zero, Project Gotham Racing 3,

567
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:40,160
Madden NFL 06, Dead or Alive 4, and Call of Duty 2.

568
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,120
Some games for the current Xbox

569
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,980
that will be enabled on Xbox Live.

570
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:48,040
Star Wars Battlefront 2, Tony Hawk American Wasteland,

571
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,060
Battlefield 2, Modern Combat.

572
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:52,240
So for those Xbox fans, some games,

573
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,360
a lot of sequels in there,

574
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,280
so some games to look forward to.

575
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,720
I think Dead or Alive will be cool.

576
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,560
Dead or Alive 4.

577
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,400
American Wasteland's gonna be pretty cool too.

578
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,960
It's like Tony Hawk Underground, but free roaming.

579
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,240
Some all one huge level.

580
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,720
Some of those clips of Dead or Alive 4, though, look so great.

581
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,780
And I've not usually been a really huge Dead or Alive fan,

582
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:11,280
but Dead or Alive 4 looks pretty hot.

583
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,480
I want to see the Dead or Alive movie.

584
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,720
All right.

585
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,320
Moving on.

586
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:20,720
Also another game being teased this week, Resident Evil 5.

587
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:25,040
The website Gamefront had some scans of the publication,

588
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:29,100
Famitsu, which gave some news this week on Resident Evil 5.

589
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,840
The interesting thing about Resident Evil 5,

590
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:34,000
remember how Resident Evil 4 was GameCube only,

591
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:40,000
at least in the beginning, Resident Evil 5 will only be on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360

592
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,560
when it first comes out.

593
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:45,060
Nintendo's getting the shaft, but I say this is because Nintendo is being so secretive

594
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:46,060
with their revolution.

595
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:49,760
Yeah, because they haven't released their system yet, and the system's like, uhhh, it'll

596
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,760
come out sometime.

597
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:55,000
I have a feeling Resident Evil 5 will make its way to the revolution, but because Nintendo

598
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
is releasing it later.

599
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,320
Well honestly, I haven't even heard if the Nintendo Revolution dev kits have even gone

600
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:06,240
out yet so well can't really make a game without that so well very interesting

601
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:10,200
also the trailer up for this to look pretty cool the speculation from the

602
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:14,720
early screenshots say that Chris Redfield who was in Resident Evil 1 and

603
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:19,560
Code Veronica looks to be the main character in this next game it looks

604
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:24,140
like the over-the-shoulder style from Resident Evil 4 will be coming back in

605
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:28,720
this game as well at least in some way but what was surprising from the early

606
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:32,860
screenshots the game appears to be a little brighter like a little more happy

607
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:36,280
brighter warm colors than previous Resident Evil games so should be

608
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:42,340
interesting all right now we here at orange lounge radio we're not just here

609
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:46,380
to talk about video games 24-7 because if we talked about video games all day

610
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:52,900
long we'd have no time to go out and enjoy fine dining and wine and cheese

611
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:58,860
tasting and to get interviewed yes so as part of bettering your life we have the

612
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:03,460
one and only dark Sakura here to present her advice column so dark Sakura what

613
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:08,380
advice do you have for our listeners tonight today's bit of advice is how to

614
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:17,060
sober up fast which actually all of us can use one avoid pills do not take

615
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:20,580
ibuprofen acetaminophen or aspirin just before during or after drinking

616
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:25,140
Acetic medicine can cause liver damage in conjunction with alcohol, ibuprofen can cause

617
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:31,140
severe stomach irritation, and aspirin thins the blood, which may exacerbate a hangover.

618
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:32,140
2.

619
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:36,980
Drink a lot of fluids.

620
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:41,420
Dehydration from alcohol can be treated with water, sweet juices, or sports drinks.

621
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:45,620
Potassium also helps you overcome the shaky feeling of a bad hangover.

622
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:46,620
3.

623
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:47,620
Take vitamins.

624
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:51,460
Vitamin or vitamin B complex can be used to combat vitamin depletion.

625
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:54,580
And when you drink, vitamin B is the first thing to go.

626
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:55,580
4.

627
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:56,580
Eat starchy food.

628
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:57,860
Lots of it.

629
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:58,860
5.

630
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:00,780
Rest or sleep for as long as possible.

631
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:01,780
6.

632
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:05,620
Repeat steps 2 through 5 if you wake up with a hangover.

633
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:09,700
But my number one bit of advice on how to sober up fast?

634
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:13,340
Don't go to any Rob's parties.

635
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:17,380
Don't use the double shot glass to make double shot drinks.

636
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:21,980
guys appreciate your support all right you know what just for that you get a

637
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:27,860
story about you Ebola just for that dungeon siege is the next movie that's

638
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:32,740

639
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:37,980
he'll be playing a villainous character in the game that's his title die

640
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:42,700
villainous characters die isn't the name of the main character farmer or something

641
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:49,700
like that. It's kind of dorky. Alright. That'd be like what in the Trogdor game, Peasants

642
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:55,940
Quest. That's enough about UiBowl. Loki, what's going on in the hack and crack scene? Well,

643
00:37:55,940 --> 00:38:01,120
there's some interesting stuff that should put a damper on the homebrew scene. PSP Firmware

644
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:06,700
2.0 was announced at the Playstation Conference just this week, and Playstation 2.0 will be

645
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:11,380
adding the elusive internet browser. That's right folks, you can actually be able to browse

646
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:16,260
internet without having to have wipeout. So let me think, Sony realized that people

647
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:20,260
were hacking their way into getting a web browser so they thought, gee, a good idea

648
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:23,260
to curb this would be to just release our own web browser.

649
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:28,420
But what's cool about their web browser, it supports everything from HTML 4.01 or whatever

650
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:34,380
that means, except for Flash, no Flash. Good, we won't get those annoying shoot the

651
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:37,620
villain to buy an iPod, or to win an iPod stupid thing.

652
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:41,300
But you can download, the other thing is that they have TV Now, which is this new thing

653
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:45,260
that they're coming out with, so basically you can download TV episodes off of this one

654
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:46,260
website.

655
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:50,340
Again, finding something that people are using their PSP for is on the internet, and making

656
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:51,340
it legit.

657
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:52,420
Smart idea, people.

658
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:56,900
Hopefully this will be able to, you'll hopefully be able to download MP3s, which, download

659
00:38:56,900 --> 00:39:01,160
our podcasts, you know, without having to, you know, do anything special.

660
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,900
Find a wifi spot, download podcasts.

661
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:03,900
Go!

662
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:04,900
Very interesting.

663
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:08,100
An eye-potter for the PSP would be cool.

664
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:12,160
Very cool. What I'm wondering is this only in Japan or is this actually gonna

665
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,220
happen here, the TV thing?

666
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:17,660
The TV thing right now I think is only in Japan. The version 2.0 is supposed to launch

667
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:20,860
in Japan on July 27th, so next week,

668
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:26,100
and also they're gonna be launching a brand new color PSP, white,

669
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:28,900
which is coming out September 21st, and that's gonna be...

670
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:29,900
Original white.

671
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:33,600
Ceramic white. I'm sorry. And it's gonna be coming out,

672
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:40,900
It's gonna be with firmware 2.0 on there, so you can't run the homebrew games, but you've got an internet browser

673
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:46,100
So but how long before they hack the 2.0 you think oh, it's gone there what they're gonna

674
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:51,520
Do is they're gonna take the PSP they're gonna take the firmware update rip the browser right out of there, and they'll be in there

675
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:58,180
New applications are becoming long though because they accidentally reveal them firmware 2.0 on the internet

676
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:01,260
And some people downloaded it and it crashed their PSPs

677
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:06,220
But, they're going to be having a calculator, a word processor, and I think a day planner

678
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:07,220
calculator.

679
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:08,540
Oh, word processor on your PSP?

680
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:09,540
Word processor.

681
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:10,540
Well, the thing is...

682
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:13,380
So that means there has to be a keyboard attachment coming out.

683
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:15,300
Yeah, that's what I was just about to say.

684
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:21,120
Keyboard support is now being added with the PSP, I think, via their IR or USB adapter

685
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,120
type thing.

686
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:24,020
So, there's going to be a PSP keyboard coming out.

687
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:26,620
Okay, so that's all the wonderful official stuff that's going on.

688
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:30,580
Of course, we don't really want to know about the official stuff, we want to talk about

689
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:33,260
Well, I found the official stuff to be interesting for once.

690
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:34,260
Okay, fine.

691
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:35,260
Talk about the unofficial stuff.

692
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:36,900
The unofficial stuff.

693
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:42,620
Brand new loaders have been released, the new hook loader and the We Are Back group

694
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:43,980
has released another loader.

695
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:48,740
These ones bypassing the update checks and now running overclock stuff and running the

696
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:57,060
full library files so you can have all this wonderful wifi and music and everything.

697
00:40:57,060 --> 00:41:01,980
It's only a matter of time before 3.0 comes out and everything runs.

698
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:03,500
It's not going to matter anymore.

699
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,740
So I just thought I'd mention that.

700
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:11,260
Also you know, upgrades to your favorite emulators, Super Nintendo 9X is now running almost full

701
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,260
speed.

702
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:13,260
Ooh, I gotta check that out.

703
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:14,260
Yeah, that's really awesome.

704
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:16,060
I mean, for research purposes only.

705
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:18,500
Well, homebrew stuff I don't think is a problem, but anyways.

706
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:22,660
I'll check it out for playing Seiken Densetsu 3 on the PS3, on the PSP.

707
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:23,660
Thank you.

708
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:24,660
Exactly.

709
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:26,460
favorite uh... the

710
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:31,000
scum version 3.0 or version 3's come out which can run uh... monkey island

711
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,500
and stuff so if you have the old

712
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:37,100
if you have the old monkey island game like i do i have a cd somewhere out there for it

713
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:40,580
i can copy it over and play it on my psp

714
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:41,680
and loom

715
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:47,140
loom i love loom i was playing this one though called uh... i don't remember it's called

716
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:48,900
the initials of B.A.S.S anyways

717
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:51,540
uh... it is an ok game but it ran really well

718
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:54,720
I was surprised, for emulating a PC game, runs great.

719
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,000
You know, I found my copy of Loom.

720
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,980
I was gonna install it and play it.

721
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:01,300
Was Maniac Mansion on that same software?

722
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:02,740
Uh...

723
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:04,180
The Day of the Tentacle was.

724
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:05,700
Ah, that's why I'm getting confused.

725
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:08,940
But Maniac Mansion, you played on the NES emulator.

726
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:10,820
And finally, the last thing I'd say is

727
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:11,980
PSPPaint

728
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:16,380
version 3 is out, so I made a cool little picture, and it's not really good.

729
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:17,720
But you can save your pictures now.

730
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:22,520
Yes, I saw your lovely interpretation of Grand Theft Auto that you had painted in there.

731
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,560
GTA made me kill.

732
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:29,280
Alright, one more story for you guys tonight and it has to do with the resurrection of

733
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,280
Acclaim.

734
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:34,920
Yes, somebody is going to be zombifying Acclaim by injecting it full of Worchester sauce.

735
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:40,680
No, actually what's going to be happening is that Central Investment Holdings is trying

736
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:47,600
to sell the rights to the Acclaim Entertainment name for $100,000.

737
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:48,680
Actually no, I take that back.

738
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:53,020
It's actually a trustee for the late company is making the agreement with Central Investment

739
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:56,720
Holdings to sell the rights for the acclaimed name for $100,000.

740
00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:03,080
Also tentative deals being reached to sell the Dave Mirra freestyle BMX series and ATV

741
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:06,480
quad power racing 2 over to Crave Entertainment.

742
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:11,000
The value of these series, $120,000.

743
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:15,960
The BMX one is not that important anymore since BMX was added to Tony Hawk's Underground

744
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:18,780
I think and American wasteland has BMX in it

745
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:26,900
Something to think about all right anyway, that's gonna do it for another podcast. Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts Loki oh

746
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:32,920
You know podcasting is so much fun dark Sakura oh

747
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:41,940
Yeah reject false icons my final thought is you are the ones who are the ball nickers

748
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:47,220
And that was the little poster that made a cameo appearance in the news article.

749
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:48,220
Alright, that's good.

750
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:53,020
What was blurred out like the genitalia on a sim?

751
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:56,820
Goodnight everybody, we'll see you next time on the Orange Lounge Radio To Go edition.

752
00:43:56,820 --> 00:44:01,460
That's the end of another Orange Lounge Radio To Go edition.

753
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:05,820
This podcast is a proud part of www.orangeloungeradio.com.
