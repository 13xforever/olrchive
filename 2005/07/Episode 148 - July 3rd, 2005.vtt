03:42.715 --> 03:43.676
[SPEAKER_04]: Huge Buffy fan.

03:43.696 --> 03:45.658
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you ever walk into his room and look through the DVD collections?

03:45.678 --> 03:46.899
[SPEAKER_11]: I've seen them from across the hall.

03:47.019 --> 03:52.004
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a whole shelf of Buffy and Angel.

03:52.564 --> 03:56.088
[SPEAKER_14]: I am of the happy for the show, but of the angst for other reasons.

03:56.268 --> 03:57.189
[SPEAKER_04]: What a waste of money.

03:57.589 --> 03:58.910
[SPEAKER_14]: Damn you, Hot Topic.

[SPEAKER_04]: Damn you!

03:59.931 --> 04:01.212
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be getting into that in a little while.

04:01.232 --> 04:02.293
[SPEAKER_04]: We all have a lot of angst.

04:02.333 --> 04:03.134
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know about Loki.

04:03.655 --> 04:04.796
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I've got big angst.

04:04.816 --> 04:05.937
[SPEAKER_04]: But I have an refrigerator now!

04:06.872 --> 04:07.332
[SPEAKER_04]: That's good.

04:07.352 --> 04:08.313
[SPEAKER_04]: Refrigerators are good.

04:08.593 --> 04:09.293
[SPEAKER_04]: Cold things are good.

04:09.453 --> 04:10.314
[SPEAKER_04]: And the washer and dryer.

04:10.354 --> 04:11.995
[SPEAKER_04]: I have some surprises in the refrigerator right now.

04:12.015 --> 04:16.137
[SPEAKER_14]: I've never been so excited to be able to do my own laundry in a long time.

04:16.617 --> 04:18.138
[SPEAKER_04]: Would it be the fish-tasting ice?

04:18.938 --> 04:20.379
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's not the fish-tasting ice.

04:20.399 --> 04:20.920
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut your mouth.

04:23.661 --> 04:25.242
[SPEAKER_04]: You just... I don't... Oh, forget it.

04:25.282 --> 04:30.405
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, in the other corner, Blabbermouth, who talks before he's introduced, Techmaster Loki.

04:30.745 --> 04:31.625
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm allowed to talk.

04:31.665 --> 04:32.486
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm part of the show.

04:33.519 --> 04:35.601
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm almost done with my drink!

04:36.001 --> 04:38.123
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki is already one drink down, boys and girls.

04:38.483 --> 04:39.304
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you drinking, Loki?

04:39.544 --> 04:40.785
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm drinking screwdrivers.

04:40.805 --> 04:42.427
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I'm going to be drinking all night long.

04:42.447 --> 04:44.228
[SPEAKER_04]: Screwdrivers, screwdrivers, screwdrivers.

04:44.268 --> 04:45.389
[SPEAKER_04]: Should I get the rest of the liquor?

04:46.170 --> 04:47.351
[SPEAKER_14]: I need to be serviced.

04:47.491 --> 04:48.372
[SPEAKER_14]: I need alcohol.

04:48.812 --> 04:49.393
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, hold on.

04:49.433 --> 04:54.798
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to go get the rest of the liquor so DarkSakura can see what I got.

04:54.858 --> 04:55.879
[SPEAKER_26]: I need to mix my own drink.

04:55.979 --> 04:58.541
[SPEAKER_04]: I got $40 worth of liquor tonight, so I'm going to go get it.

04:58.581 --> 05:00.203
[SPEAKER_04]: So somebody's got to fill time during this intro.

05:00.223 --> 05:01.724
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell the kids what they have to look forward to.

05:01.744 --> 05:04.046
[SPEAKER_14]: I had ice cream because I'm cheating like hell today.

05:04.647 --> 05:09.271
[SPEAKER_14]: I am having so much liquor that I'm probably going to end up in the hospital with blood poisoning.

05:10.012 --> 05:12.113
[SPEAKER_14]: As in, you know, too much blood in my alcohol level.

05:12.133 --> 05:19.335
[SPEAKER_04]: See, Rob had something rotten in his freezer, so all of his ice tastes really fucking nasty, so all my drinks are, like, not cold.

05:20.116 --> 05:20.916
[SPEAKER_14]: Wings of fish.

05:22.256 --> 05:22.756
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

05:22.876 --> 05:26.918
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, I smelled, I sniffed in there like, eugh, what is that?

05:27.418 --> 05:28.960
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I don't know, man.

05:29.000 --> 05:37.770
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, even when our nasty freezer didn't smell that bad, but... I can't really get too shitfaced tonight, because I'm going to go drink at the club, too.

05:40.974 --> 05:43.456
[SPEAKER_14]: You also got me pineapple Malibu, but I have Guinness!

05:44.157 --> 05:45.379
[SPEAKER_14]: And a bottle opener!

05:46.744 --> 05:55.471
[SPEAKER_04]: I got Guinness, peppermint schnapps, Malibu pineapple rum, and there's also Smirnoff mandarin orange.

05:55.611 --> 05:57.212
[SPEAKER_18]: Do you have any normal Malibu?

05:58.333 --> 06:04.018
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think there's any left, I hate to say it.

06:04.298 --> 06:05.078
[SPEAKER_04]: Guinness on sale!

06:05.198 --> 06:08.281
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that the same bottle of Bacardi that's been sitting there for like weeks now?

06:09.642 --> 06:10.663
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably, I don't know.

06:12.164 --> 06:12.624
[SPEAKER_14]: Guinness!

06:13.265 --> 06:13.845
[SPEAKER_14]: Good batch!

06:15.086 --> 06:15.627
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, buzzy.

06:17.392 --> 06:19.173
[SPEAKER_13]: Looker, looker, looker.

06:19.233 --> 06:19.974
[SPEAKER_13]: I want a drink.

06:20.054 --> 06:21.975
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to screw the show.

06:21.995 --> 06:22.776
[SPEAKER_04]: Give me booze.

06:22.796 --> 06:24.697
[SPEAKER_04]: We will be back after this break.

06:25.858 --> 06:26.978
[SPEAKER_04]: What is wrong with that mic?

06:27.119 --> 06:28.800
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not drunk yet.

06:29.340 --> 06:30.401
[SPEAKER_24]: It needs more alcohol.

06:30.421 --> 06:31.261
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to be dunked.

06:32.062 --> 06:33.002
[SPEAKER_04]: We will work on that.

06:34.303 --> 06:37.165
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course our alcohol show disclaimer when we come back after this.

06:37.866 --> 06:40.447
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not responsible for anything we say or do.

06:40.588 --> 06:41.888
[SPEAKER_04]: Or who we kill.

06:41.988 --> 06:42.569
[SPEAKER_04]: After this break.

06:42.609 --> 06:46.712
[SPEAKER_04]: In this break, some music that was popular when Orange Lounge Radio first started.

07:14.569 --> 07:15.309
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

07:15.989 --> 07:18.330
[SPEAKER_04]: Up, down, up, down, choo, choo, choo.

[SPEAKER_04]: We'll start it off with Busta.

07:24.473 --> 07:26.514
[SPEAKER_04]: I will go find something to open that with.

07:26.754 --> 07:27.694
[SPEAKER_13]: Isn't it Twisty Off?

07:29.435 --> 07:29.995
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be back.

07:30.876 --> 07:31.836
[SPEAKER_13]: Not Twisty Off.

07:31.856 --> 07:35.718
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be back after this with more whining, courtesy of DarkSakura.

07:57.595 --> 07:58.956
The sound, it's coming out now

08:29.674 --> 08:36.040
[SPEAKER_15]: and I won't stop, like a pistol I keep on turning, like a fire I keep on burning, dance around in the place, and I'm a DJ right to place.

10:03.997 --> 10:05.199
Thanks for watching!

10:48.219 --> 10:49.381
Thanks for watching!

12:43.067 --> 12:43.848
Thank you.

13:46.308 --> 13:56.816
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, this is Jamie, you know me better as DarkSakura.

13:57.257 --> 14:04.562
[SPEAKER_11]: Please feel free to join us on June 23rd at 7pm for our first show of the Orange Lounge, the new Berlani Community Talk Show.

14:06.724 --> 14:08.265
[SPEAKER_11]: If you're not there, we'll hunt you down.

14:08.285 --> 14:09.306
[SPEAKER_11]: We know where you live.

14:09.366 --> 14:10.107
[SPEAKER_11]: We have your numbers.

14:10.147 --> 14:11.208
[SPEAKER_11]: We looked it up on the internet.

14:11.974 --> 14:13.816
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, we're back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

14:13.836 --> 14:14.676
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit of retro there.

14:15.097 --> 14:17.579
[SPEAKER_04]: That was one of the first commercials for Orange Lounge Radio we ran on here.

14:17.999 --> 14:20.261
[SPEAKER_04]: We are having a catastrophe here in studio.

14:20.301 --> 14:21.743
[SPEAKER_04]: This is horrible.

14:23.284 --> 14:27.488
[SPEAKER_04]: Nowhere in this apartment was there a bottle opener anywhere.

14:29.009 --> 14:30.570
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there screaming coming from the kitchen?

14:30.710 --> 14:32.732
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but Jamie split a nail.

14:32.992 --> 14:36.075
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie split a nail trying to open a bottle of Guinness with a knife.

14:38.846 --> 14:44.651
[SPEAKER_04]: While I'm running around the house trying to find a lighter that I remember once having that had a bottle opener on the end of it.

14:45.011 --> 14:51.957
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is the first time that I'm going to regret quitting smoking because if I was still smoking, I'd probably still have that lighter on me.

14:53.878 --> 14:54.179
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well.

14:55.179 --> 15:06.329
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you feeling now that you finally get... Finally, by the way, Nelly, Loki's fiancee, ran downstairs and picked up a bottle opener from the neighbors, which would have been the smart thing to do in the first place, so...

15:08.089 --> 15:12.532
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura has a Guinness, Loki's on his second screwdriver.

15:13.733 --> 15:17.836
[SPEAKER_04]: I still have not drank in anything, so I've got to go get that Guinness that you opened up for me.

15:18.917 --> 15:19.537
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll be back.

15:19.557 --> 15:20.258
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys fill time.

15:23.040 --> 15:24.241
[SPEAKER_14]: I like Guinness a whole bunch.

15:25.762 --> 15:26.222
[SPEAKER_14]: Yep, I do.

15:27.583 --> 15:27.904
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?

15:29.365 --> 15:34.889
[SPEAKER_14]: It's better than that camel piss they sell, you know, Coors or whatever.

15:36.977 --> 15:41.499
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

15:59.639 --> 16:05.040
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been listening to show tunes in my car I got the Spamalot CD, the Money Python Broadway play

16:29.176 --> 16:31.298
[SPEAKER_04]: Night by the way, if you're looking for a quality show...

16:59.261 --> 17:02.242
[SPEAKER_04]: Our show is as good as those fireworks out there.

17:02.802 --> 17:07.304
[SPEAKER_04]: It started off great, but it kind of degrades after, you know, over time.

17:07.504 --> 17:09.785
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll open up the Skype line so you can give your congratulations.

17:09.805 --> 17:11.326
[SPEAKER_23]: We tone it down for your safety.

17:11.846 --> 17:12.346
[SPEAKER_14]: One down!

17:15.888 --> 17:17.669
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, good luck getting the next one open.

17:18.569 --> 17:19.389
[SPEAKER_14]: That's because I already opened it.

17:19.469 --> 17:19.809
[SPEAKER_14]: Aha!

17:20.230 --> 17:21.390
[SPEAKER_04]: I took one that was already open.

17:21.410 --> 17:22.130
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope you open three.

17:23.491 --> 17:23.691
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

17:25.137 --> 17:26.680
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, they gave us the bottle opener, it doesn't matter.

17:27.421 --> 17:28.743
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no, the neighbors downstairs gave it to us.

17:29.164 --> 17:29.625
[SPEAKER_04]: They took it back.

17:31.789 --> 17:32.871
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, and they said, no, keep it.

17:36.041 --> 17:37.382
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura's all excited.

17:37.722 --> 17:38.203
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, anyway.

17:38.863 --> 17:39.424
[SPEAKER_04]: How was your week?

17:39.464 --> 17:40.024
[SPEAKER_04]: How was your day?

17:40.064 --> 17:41.826
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll start off the show with the classic.

17:41.846 --> 17:44.928
[SPEAKER_04]: We weren't here last week, so we've got two weeks to catch up on.

17:44.948 --> 17:45.749
[SPEAKER_03]: What did they do last week?

17:45.769 --> 17:46.289
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wait, I'm sorry.

17:46.309 --> 17:47.510
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to do the drunk disclaimer.

17:47.850 --> 17:48.130
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

17:48.150 --> 17:49.572
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to start off the show with a drunk disclaimer.

17:49.912 --> 17:54.796
[SPEAKER_04]: Boys and girls, myself, Loki, and DarkSakura all indulging in a little bit of liquor tonight.

17:55.176 --> 17:58.959
[SPEAKER_04]: But please, if you are going to drink, drink responsibly, which we will be doing for the most part.

17:59.679 --> 18:01.241
[SPEAKER_04]: And have a designated driver.

18:01.281 --> 18:02.862
[SPEAKER_04]: We do have several designated drivers tonight.

18:02.982 --> 18:04.123
[SPEAKER_04]: Extifer is remaining sober.

18:04.383 --> 18:04.683
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

18:19.796 --> 18:21.256
[SPEAKER_04]: Blame it on Grand Theft Auto.

18:21.556 --> 18:22.717
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, blame it on Grand Theft Auto.

18:22.737 --> 18:23.217
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll believe that.

18:23.477 --> 18:24.017
[SPEAKER_23]: Exactly.

18:24.097 --> 18:24.697
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, how was your week?

18:24.717 --> 18:25.057
[SPEAKER_04]: How was your day?

18:25.097 --> 18:26.158
[SPEAKER_23]: What was it?

18:26.198 --> 18:26.518
[SPEAKER_23]: My week?

18:26.938 --> 18:27.738
[SPEAKER_23]: What did I do last week?

18:27.938 --> 18:30.979
[SPEAKER_23]: I think I went down and met the rabbi.

18:31.219 --> 18:32.679
[SPEAKER_23]: I believe that was last week.

18:33.059 --> 18:35.260
[SPEAKER_23]: And we went down to San Francisco and that kind of sucked.

18:36.660 --> 18:37.801
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, that's what we did last Sunday.

18:39.141 --> 18:46.683
[SPEAKER_23]: So we did that and that was kind of boring because, you know, San Francisco sucks and it was kind of cold and we went to the Cheesecake Factory and they have lean pizza there.

18:47.264 --> 18:48.124
[SPEAKER_23]: I picked up Destroy All Humans

19:00.758 --> 19:06.401
[SPEAKER_04]: and I actually beat that game today and what else?

19:06.862 --> 19:30.375
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I got another PSP as a spiff from my work so now I have two PSPs and I'm playing this game Dead to Rights Reckoning right now which is okay and no DDR at all because I have no computer to play it on my cabinet because my sister is borrowing my cabinet computer and that sucks.

19:30.839 --> 19:31.079
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

19:31.600 --> 19:33.323
[SPEAKER_04]: Because she needs a computer for school.

19:34.264 --> 19:37.349
[SPEAKER_04]: And I tried building her one out of the really shitty parts I had, and it didn't work.

19:40.474 --> 19:41.716
[SPEAKER_04]: Alas, she had to borrow it.

19:42.998 --> 19:45.602
[SPEAKER_04]: So my cabinet computer is gone for the summer.

19:47.634 --> 19:47.934
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh well.

19:48.015 --> 19:49.436
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not like you were using it anyway.

19:49.616 --> 19:50.517
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I used it once.

19:50.537 --> 19:54.462
[SPEAKER_04]: You built this huge main cabinet, it was a huge deal, and you spent how much money on this main cabinet?

19:54.682 --> 19:55.282
[SPEAKER_04]: About $3,000.

19:55.322 --> 19:57.425
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, thousands of dollars on this cabinet.

19:57.785 --> 20:00.788
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, I think I saw you play in the Simpsons arcade game once.

20:01.649 --> 20:03.031
[SPEAKER_23]: I used to play a lot more than that.

20:03.982 --> 20:09.725
[SPEAKER_23]: It's just, you know, what it comes down to right now is just I haven't been able to work on it lately.

20:09.925 --> 20:14.127
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, once I get more stuff in there, like a Beatmania controller or something, it'll be a lot more fun.

20:14.808 --> 20:27.555
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was playing DDR on it, but the problem is I have to still mod the pads to ground up static on them, and then it'll work, and then I can play DDR and get in shape and the whole plan and everything.

20:28.275 --> 20:31.777
[SPEAKER_04]: But right now, it's just, you know... Are you going to have a six-pack and all that stuff?

20:33.752 --> 20:35.233
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, how are you on number three already?

20:35.454 --> 20:36.755
[SPEAKER_04]: You drank number one in front of us.

20:36.995 --> 20:37.716
[SPEAKER_04]: Double shot of vodka.

20:39.337 --> 20:40.979
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, in that case, I'm on number four.

20:44.142 --> 20:46.965
[SPEAKER_14]: Double shots count as one beverage because it's in one glass.

20:47.846 --> 20:49.027
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, then where did number two go?

20:49.067 --> 20:50.188
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm still on number one.

20:50.208 --> 20:51.730
[SPEAKER_14]: I am on number three.

20:52.230 --> 20:52.751
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, anyway.

20:52.791 --> 20:53.812
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but where did number two go?

20:54.732 --> 20:55.954
[SPEAKER_14]: I did a double shot of vodka.

20:56.394 --> 20:58.056
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well, then what's this that you're drinking now?

20:59.282 --> 21:04.284
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, sugar-free cherry Jones Soda, and a double shot of vodka.

21:04.304 --> 21:06.445
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.

21:07.586 --> 21:09.447
[SPEAKER_14]: I can drink vodka straight, thank you.

21:10.207 --> 21:11.448
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, uh, Mame Cabinet.

21:12.128 --> 21:14.549
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, yeah, so, Mame Cabinet and the computer are gone.

21:14.969 --> 21:15.289
[SPEAKER_04]: For now.

21:15.309 --> 21:16.990
[SPEAKER_04]: Because Mrs. Stresser has to do homework.

21:18.680 --> 21:19.000
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

21:19.240 --> 21:21.882
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really all I did this week, is just playing Destroy All Humans.

21:22.222 --> 21:29.126
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a lot of fun throwing people around using psychic abilities, especially with the ragdoll physics in that game.

21:29.446 --> 21:35.209
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes for a lot of fun, like you can pick up cows and smash them and stuff, and just people, and it's a lot of fun.

21:35.429 --> 21:35.969
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of fun.

21:37.250 --> 21:40.872
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, so that's pretty much all I've been playing this week, and, um...

21:42.082 --> 21:43.142
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's pretty much it.

21:43.462 --> 21:45.763
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you went and saw the War of the Worlds, right?

21:46.003 --> 21:46.423
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

21:46.463 --> 21:47.023
[SPEAKER_04]: How was that?

21:47.423 --> 21:48.364
[SPEAKER_23]: That was good.

21:49.204 --> 21:50.904
[SPEAKER_06]: I have no interest in seeing War of the Worlds.

21:50.944 --> 21:51.525
[SPEAKER_06]: It was good.

21:51.885 --> 21:55.926
[SPEAKER_06]: I know I've been hearing it's really good, but I'm like, Tom Cruise is so 80s.

21:56.026 --> 21:57.126
[SPEAKER_04]: Who cares about Tom Cruise?

21:57.366 --> 21:58.987
[SPEAKER_13]: Tom Cruise isn't white.

21:59.027 --> 22:00.507
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't like Spielberg movies, either.

22:00.607 --> 22:01.167
[SPEAKER_04]: I really don't.

22:01.187 --> 22:03.828
[SPEAKER_13]: The only Spielberg movie I ever liked... Terminator 2 was fucking awesome!

22:03.848 --> 22:05.768
[SPEAKER_13]: That was not a Spielberg movie!

22:06.028 --> 22:06.349
Wasn't it?

22:06.389 --> 22:06.949
Yeah, it was.

22:06.969 --> 22:07.789
No, that was Cameron...

22:08.069 --> 22:10.750
[SPEAKER_07]: Steven Spielberg presents Terminator 2.

22:11.070 --> 22:17.253
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think you can give Cameron because he's awesome.

22:17.593 --> 22:20.994
[SPEAKER_13]: Termy, can you help me save the world?

22:21.895 --> 22:23.115
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

22:23.255 --> 22:23.876
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

22:25.556 --> 22:27.537
[SPEAKER_07]: Terminator, phone home.

22:27.997 --> 22:28.838
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll be back.

22:29.078 --> 22:30.779
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't really want to hurt humans.

22:30.959 --> 22:32.939
[SPEAKER_07]: I just have to because I'm programmed this way.

22:32.959 --> 22:36.441
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you think that the Star Wars movies would have been better if Spielberg had a hand in them?

22:37.353 --> 22:39.914
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they couldn't have missed, because anything is better than Lucas.

22:40.735 --> 22:42.155
[SPEAKER_04]: Although, episode 3 was pretty cool.

22:42.275 --> 22:42.776
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give them that.

22:43.036 --> 22:45.617
[SPEAKER_14]: I saw George Lucas, and I almost looked at him.

22:45.897 --> 22:51.480
[SPEAKER_04]: First off, people, this is not, you know, this is not E- So take the fire up close.

22:51.540 --> 22:51.860
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

22:51.880 --> 22:53.481
[SPEAKER_04]: I am so hot.

22:54.561 --> 22:55.582
[SPEAKER_23]: This is not E.T.

22:55.642 --> 22:56.182
[SPEAKER_23]: Spielberg.

22:56.242 --> 22:58.083
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Dual Spielberg.

22:58.123 --> 23:00.064
[SPEAKER_04]: This is like Dark Spielberg, okay?

23:00.524 --> 23:01.685
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Evil Spielberg.

23:02.005 --> 23:04.686
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, so, um- Do you know who I am?

23:04.706 --> 23:06.367
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have a tray?

23:08.595 --> 23:09.596
[SPEAKER_13]: This is not a game.

23:09.636 --> 23:10.958
[SPEAKER_13]: Who the fuck are you?

23:13.220 --> 23:15.223
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't even get that.

23:16.704 --> 23:17.205
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways.

23:19.407 --> 23:21.270
[SPEAKER_04]: I highly recommend going to see this movie.

23:21.410 --> 23:22.311
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to see it again.

23:22.491 --> 23:23.352
[SPEAKER_04]: It was really good.

23:23.452 --> 23:25.154
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a movie that will stick with you.

23:25.214 --> 23:26.616
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like, you know, like, wow.

23:27.196 --> 23:28.458
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's one of those, you know.

23:28.772 --> 23:28.992
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura

23:49.187 --> 23:54.329
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the same thing about the Wicked Witch of the West How could she walk around fucking Oz?

24:12.017 --> 24:13.798
[SPEAKER_14]: When there's condensation in the air.

24:14.139 --> 24:17.061
[SPEAKER_04]: How do we know that Oz was based around a carbon base, you know?

24:17.301 --> 24:21.164
[SPEAKER_14]: Cause it was on fucking Earth and they could freakin' fly a balloon to Kansas!

24:22.536 --> 24:25.438
[SPEAKER_04]: And Batman Begins... Well, Oz is part of Hollywood, dammit!

24:25.619 --> 24:27.060
[SPEAKER_04]: Batman Begins, what the fuck?

24:27.100 --> 24:28.140
[SPEAKER_04]: Our bodies are made of water.

24:28.180 --> 24:28.981
[SPEAKER_04]: What the fuck was that?

24:29.281 --> 24:31.723
[SPEAKER_13]: I haven't seen a damn movie, so shut up.

24:31.763 --> 24:33.244
[SPEAKER_04]: If you saw the movie, what the fuck?

24:33.264 --> 24:34.064
[SPEAKER_04]: Our bodies are made of water.

24:34.085 --> 24:34.705
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good point.

24:34.725 --> 24:35.906
[SPEAKER_04]: People would explode.

24:36.246 --> 24:37.347
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have liked that better.

24:39.368 --> 24:42.931
[SPEAKER_04]: I liked Batman Begins because it had the setup of one of the 60s Batmans.

24:43.351 --> 25:04.516
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, you know, that's been great, like, you know, like, they have this great plan and stuff, you know, the vaporized water and whatnot, and then people start explaining, they're all, well, that's an unseen, that's an unseen side effect, but okay, hey, I'm going with it, you know, poison people, make them explode, whatever, hey, as long as, the same, you know, consequence.

25:07.419 --> 25:09.082
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, by the way.

25:22.102 --> 25:23.802
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been playing a game non-stop all week, too.

25:23.842 --> 25:25.843
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know whether to talk about it now or on the podcast.

25:25.863 --> 25:31.484
[SPEAKER_04]: And by the way, usually we tape our podcasts right after the show, so I'm kind of worried about tonight's podcast.

25:31.544 --> 25:32.144
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, who cares?

25:33.605 --> 25:33.985
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

25:34.525 --> 25:37.346
[SPEAKER_23]: But anyways, yeah, Destroy All Humans, awesome game.

25:37.406 --> 25:37.926
[SPEAKER_23]: It's a lot of fun.

25:37.986 --> 25:47.868
[SPEAKER_04]: What's great about it, though, is one of the main Martian or Furon, the alien race or whatever, is voiced by the guy that does Invader Zim.

25:48.308 --> 25:49.329
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's Zim.

25:49.869 --> 25:52.411
[SPEAKER_04]: The game is basically Invader Zim the game.

25:52.531 --> 25:53.471
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just awesome.

25:53.491 --> 25:58.314
[SPEAKER_04]: And they've got some other voice actors from other cartoons out there.

25:58.334 --> 26:06.259
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's a guy from King of the Hill and some other ones I recognized but I wasn't positive because I don't remember voice actor names.

26:06.740 --> 26:09.061
[SPEAKER_04]: But Invader Zim guy, I was like, oh!

26:10.382 --> 26:10.642
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura

26:36.563 --> 26:45.930
[SPEAKER_14]: I spent all week moving my shit from my apartment, which sucks a whole bunch of ass.

26:46.391 --> 26:50.274
[SPEAKER_14]: It sucks an ass larger than that of Roseanne Barr at her biggest.

26:52.015 --> 26:54.817
[SPEAKER_04]: Or Rosie O'Donnell at current.

26:54.897 --> 26:55.918
[SPEAKER_14]: God, that one was chunky.

26:57.759 --> 27:01.120
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, I've moved all this stuff from the apartment.

27:01.140 --> 27:01.861
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, Dan and I did.

27:01.881 --> 27:02.761
[SPEAKER_14]: It took two days off.

27:03.041 --> 27:04.542
[SPEAKER_14]: And we got all this stuff from our apartment.

27:05.002 --> 27:08.063
[SPEAKER_14]: And he says it's like a really twisted Christmas.

27:09.003 --> 27:14.726
[SPEAKER_14]: Where you're opening all these presents that's full of your own shit and you don't know what's in what box.

27:15.926 --> 27:17.647
[SPEAKER_14]: I've got the kitchen mostly unpacked.

27:19.527 --> 27:20.148
[SPEAKER_14]: And, um...

27:21.658 --> 27:24.120
[SPEAKER_14]: Then working on that today and yesterday for a bit.

27:24.160 --> 27:25.460
[SPEAKER_14]: And then we got our refrigerator.

27:26.201 --> 27:27.162
[SPEAKER_14]: We got our washer and dryer.

27:27.202 --> 27:28.562
[SPEAKER_14]: We spent over $2,700 for that trip.

27:28.623 --> 27:29.763
[SPEAKER_24]: So you're in a house now?

27:30.224 --> 27:30.804
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm in a house.

27:31.204 --> 27:31.444
[SPEAKER_14]: Awesome.

27:31.464 --> 27:32.785
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to be living there for some time.

27:33.246 --> 27:42.331
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm thinking that we might even move studio maybe if everyone's not supposed to because I live in Citrus Heights instead of Rancho Cambodia.

27:46.214 --> 27:46.854
[SPEAKER_14]: That happened too.

27:48.240 --> 27:48.460
[SPEAKER_24]: Really?

27:48.620 --> 27:49.100
[SPEAKER_24]: You don't say.

27:49.340 --> 27:51.941
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm having very juicy burps, and I don't know why.

27:51.961 --> 27:53.002
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

27:54.342 --> 27:56.743
[SPEAKER_14]: Dan's supposed to be here any moment now with my pants.

27:57.743 --> 28:02.905
[SPEAKER_14]: And I've got to go downstairs and pretend to be sober.

28:03.405 --> 28:04.706
[SPEAKER_14]: And make it down the stairs.

28:04.726 --> 28:05.646
[SPEAKER_14]: That's going to be fun.

28:06.446 --> 28:07.447
[SPEAKER_14]: Just slide down the rail.

28:08.367 --> 28:13.249
[SPEAKER_14]: We got a 50-inch freaking HD widescreen projection TV.

28:14.884 --> 28:17.292
[SPEAKER_14]: And this thing is huge.

28:17.312 --> 28:20.704
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a very big TV.

28:20.764 --> 28:21.848
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it 50 inch huge?

28:23.186 --> 28:24.687
[SPEAKER_14]: It is very satisfying.

28:26.168 --> 28:27.288
[SPEAKER_14]: I could do that.

28:27.728 --> 28:28.789
[SPEAKER_14]: I could ride that thing all night.

28:29.649 --> 28:30.070
[SPEAKER_14]: Or watch it.

28:30.290 --> 28:30.950
[SPEAKER_23]: You could ride.

28:31.270 --> 28:33.771
[SPEAKER_23]: She's gonna ride the TV all night long.

28:33.791 --> 28:35.132
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you hear that?

28:35.232 --> 28:37.713
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to mix it onto the TV.

28:37.994 --> 28:44.577
[SPEAKER_04]: For those of you keeping drink counts at home, I'm now drinking four shots of Malibu Pineapple mixed with 7-Up.

28:45.958 --> 28:47.798
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have my DDR ice in there.

28:47.818 --> 28:48.399
[SPEAKER_04]: Taste!

28:49.079 --> 28:51.420
[SPEAKER_04]: I found ice trays at Ikea that are arrows.

28:51.440 --> 28:54.021
[SPEAKER_04]: Does the ice taste like fish?

28:54.121 --> 28:54.321
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

28:54.461 --> 28:55.761
[SPEAKER_04]: The drink is hella good, by the way.

28:56.961 --> 28:58.842
[SPEAKER_04]: So the ice is kosher?

28:59.002 --> 28:59.782
[SPEAKER_04]: The ice is kosher.

29:00.282 --> 29:03.443
[SPEAKER_14]: I found out that I'm not as big of a rum fan as I once was.

29:03.623 --> 29:07.605
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm going to go start on shot 5 and 6, I think.

29:08.805 --> 29:14.747
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, this is shot 4, but I have had Guinness as well, and I'm going to have Guinness next.

29:14.767 --> 29:15.927
[SPEAKER_23]: We'll count that as a shot, I guess.

29:16.451 --> 29:26.782
[SPEAKER_23]: because I'm going by like, you know, how they count drinks, you know, as a shot of alcohol is a drink and beer is a drink and whatever else is, a glass of wine I guess is a drink, so.

29:28.106 --> 29:34.271
[SPEAKER_14]: This will be... But I'm really, really... I'm gonna take it easy on the show because I'm gonna be at the club tonight.

29:34.551 --> 29:36.892
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we're going to the club later.

29:36.912 --> 29:38.374
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you guys are going to the club.

29:38.474 --> 29:39.254
[SPEAKER_04]: I ain't going nowhere.

29:39.274 --> 29:43.097
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you think that he would take us by the ATM so I can drink my... Probably.

29:43.137 --> 29:44.458
[SPEAKER_04]: We can talk Xtifer into it.

29:44.698 --> 29:45.159
[SPEAKER_14]: Yay!

29:45.659 --> 29:46.560
[SPEAKER_04]: Xtifer's in a good mood.

29:46.580 --> 29:47.280
[SPEAKER_04]: He met his crush.

29:47.720 --> 29:47.840
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

29:48.701 --> 29:50.123
[SPEAKER_14]: I need to meet his crush next.

29:50.163 --> 29:52.245
[SPEAKER_14]: I need to go down and give him a drunken thank you.

29:53.326 --> 29:55.568
[SPEAKER_14]: And I need to hear his, like, hot British accent.

29:55.748 --> 29:58.691
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, I missed your week and your day, but I'm sure it was good.

29:59.071 --> 30:00.052
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it wasn't!

30:00.533 --> 30:01.133
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, not today.

30:01.173 --> 30:02.074
[SPEAKER_04]: Your day wasn't good.

30:02.615 --> 30:04.637
[SPEAKER_13]: My week was spent with boxes!

30:06.630 --> 30:17.955
[SPEAKER_14]: I sleep surrounded by dirty laundry, because all of our laundry is dirty and we haven't had a washing machine, which we just got today, and guess what I get to do on the 4th of July?

30:18.535 --> 30:18.915
[SPEAKER_14]: Laundry?

30:18.935 --> 30:20.096
[SPEAKER_13]: Fucking laundry!

30:20.876 --> 30:23.317
[SPEAKER_13]: I have neighbors, people.

30:23.978 --> 30:28.480
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry for your neighbors, but I have lots of laundry-related eggs.

30:28.500 --> 30:31.641
[SPEAKER_04]: We realize what happens when they give us a can opener.

30:32.361 --> 30:33.822
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on, or a bottle opener.

30:33.942 --> 30:35.823
[SPEAKER_13]: We like you sexy British men.

30:38.032 --> 30:38.592
[SPEAKER_04]: Jesus.

30:38.832 --> 30:40.533
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't love the sexy British man.

30:40.573 --> 30:40.933
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

30:41.333 --> 30:42.033
[SPEAKER_13]: That's okay.

30:42.393 --> 30:43.593
[SPEAKER_13]: I will love him for you.

30:43.613 --> 30:45.473
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

30:46.794 --> 30:47.574
[SPEAKER_04]: Alrighty then.

30:48.234 --> 30:49.314
[SPEAKER_14]: I love my Dan.

30:50.394 --> 30:55.816
[SPEAKER_14]: Because he understands that every so often, if I don't have liquor, I'll shrivel up and die.

30:56.556 --> 30:59.436
[SPEAKER_04]: I think if we get a TV show, I'm going to always do it drunk.

31:01.977 --> 31:07.398
[SPEAKER_14]: You're going to sit back and be like, I'm Loki and I'm angry and drunk.

31:08.965 --> 31:19.950
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to be wearing one of those leisure suits, not necessarily a leisure suit, but something like Hugh Hefner would be wearing, like a bathrobe and slippers, and be sitting there with a martini.

31:21.190 --> 31:24.211
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of those hosts on G4 have to be drunk to get through.

31:25.072 --> 31:28.873
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't you know that everyone in Hollywood is either drunk or on drugs?

31:29.654 --> 31:30.474
[SPEAKER_14]: Or roller skates.

31:31.346 --> 31:40.787
[SPEAKER_13]: LOLerskates LOLerskates LOLerskates LOLerskates LOLerskates LOLerskates LOLerskates LOLerskates LOLerskates LOLerskates LOLerskates LOLerskates

31:41.275 --> 31:41.755
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, God.

31:41.775 --> 31:43.217
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what, Rob?

31:43.677 --> 31:45.678
[SPEAKER_14]: That can has been on your desk for a year.

31:46.019 --> 31:46.459
[SPEAKER_04]: Chatroom?

31:46.499 --> 31:46.899
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it hasn't.

31:47.180 --> 31:54.025
[SPEAKER_04]: Chatroom, they said I only had four drinks, but that is one Guinness and four shots.

31:54.125 --> 31:56.186
[SPEAKER_14]: We're even right now, Chatroom.

31:56.207 --> 31:58.088
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going by government drinks, okay?

31:58.228 --> 32:01.611
[SPEAKER_04]: Technically, this would be a second drink if I were counting actual drinks.

32:02.812 --> 32:07.395
[SPEAKER_14]: By actual drink numbers, Rob has had two, Loki has had two, I have had three.

32:08.336 --> 32:09.096
[SPEAKER_14]: By shot.

32:09.537 --> 32:09.737
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

32:10.526 --> 32:12.067
[SPEAKER_14]: We are all dead tied at five.

32:12.567 --> 32:13.507
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm at four.

32:13.587 --> 32:17.309
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to be starting five in just a second here as soon as I finish the last bit of my drink.

32:18.409 --> 32:25.753
[SPEAKER_14]: And I apologize for belching, but I'm having soda with my vodka right now, which I... You all know that I am a belch monster already.

32:26.833 --> 32:30.255
[SPEAKER_14]: That is my one highly unfeminine trait.

32:30.415 --> 32:33.156
[SPEAKER_04]: Excuse me while I take a brief recess to get some more alcohol.

32:33.736 --> 32:39.699
[SPEAKER_14]: I also have other unfeminine traits like climbing trees and shooting people with guns and driving a tank.

32:41.613 --> 32:43.354
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the adventures of LOL!

32:44.655 --> 32:47.516
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh my god!

32:47.656 --> 32:48.997
[SPEAKER_13]: I could do a webcomic of that!

32:49.797 --> 32:51.258
[SPEAKER_13]: Wouldn't that be fucking funny?

32:51.278 --> 32:51.338
[SPEAKER_13]: LOL!

32:51.518 --> 32:53.319
[SPEAKER_13]: You're gonna do a webcomic LOL!

32:53.479 --> 32:53.839
[SPEAKER_13]: LOL!

32:55.800 --> 32:56.180
[SPEAKER_13]: Burb!

32:56.820 --> 32:57.401
[SPEAKER_13]: You're a burb!

32:57.721 --> 32:59.382
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki, you're a burb!

32:59.702 --> 33:00.302
[SPEAKER_14]: Burb!

33:00.382 --> 33:00.802
[SPEAKER_14]: Burb!

33:01.122 --> 33:01.483
[SPEAKER_14]: Burb!

33:01.823 --> 33:02.283
[SPEAKER_14]: Burb!

33:03.363 --> 33:07.545
[SPEAKER_14]: No, seriously, I'm gonna do the Orange Sounds webcomic, but I need someone who does Flash.

33:08.206 --> 33:10.767
[SPEAKER_14]: Cause we need to have our fictional studio online.

33:11.684 --> 33:14.810
[SPEAKER_14]: where everyone can explore and interact with us.

33:14.830 --> 33:20.621
[SPEAKER_14]: Rob, I have an observation for you.

33:20.661 --> 33:21.864
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a very obvious one.

33:21.904 --> 33:22.304
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that?

33:23.916 --> 33:25.436
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, I'm trying my best.

33:25.557 --> 33:26.457
[SPEAKER_04]: It's because you're drinking.

33:26.497 --> 33:27.537
[SPEAKER_04]: You're getting hot from drinking.

33:27.617 --> 33:28.618
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just hot anyway.

33:29.938 --> 33:30.758
[SPEAKER_04]: We know, we know.

33:31.819 --> 33:33.939
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, my week and my day.

33:33.999 --> 33:36.520
[SPEAKER_14]: My mutant ability is not belching.

33:36.900 --> 33:38.921
[SPEAKER_14]: It's staring at traffic like, no!

33:38.941 --> 33:41.582
[SPEAKER_14]: Who is the diva of the show?

33:41.662 --> 33:43.122
[SPEAKER_14]: I do not believe that it is you.

33:43.142 --> 33:47.043
[SPEAKER_13]: I am an internet fucking celebrity.

33:48.764 --> 33:51.845
[SPEAKER_14]: I am not a celebrity who fucks the internet, except for screwing it over.

33:52.808 --> 33:54.029
[SPEAKER_14]: I am an internet celebrity.

33:54.569 --> 33:56.130
[SPEAKER_14]: That makes me the diva of the show.

33:57.191 --> 33:57.491
[SPEAKER_14]: Hello?

33:58.272 --> 34:00.053
[SPEAKER_14]: My power cable just fell out of my lap.

34:00.073 --> 34:01.274
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm an internet celebrity too.

34:01.314 --> 34:02.394
[SPEAKER_04]: I have like 140 friends on Myspace.

34:02.414 --> 34:03.935
[SPEAKER_14]: I have to plug myself in again.

34:04.556 --> 34:09.819
[SPEAKER_14]: I joined Myspace a month ago and I have 42 people, including Corey Feldman.

34:11.981 --> 34:13.302
[SPEAKER_14]: Corey Feldman is my buddy.

34:15.731 --> 34:18.952
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to make a MySpace profile for Adventures of LoL.

34:19.513 --> 34:20.153
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

34:20.633 --> 34:23.054
[SPEAKER_14]: I made an Orange Zones one, but I haven't done shit with it yet.

34:23.194 --> 34:24.214
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not in heat, shut up!

34:26.155 --> 34:27.716
[SPEAKER_14]: If I were in heat, you would know.

34:27.996 --> 34:30.317
[SPEAKER_14]: Because if it wouldn't be you, I would be Heat Matt.

34:32.037 --> 34:32.398
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

34:32.838 --> 34:34.138
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you finished so I can talk about my week?

34:34.158 --> 34:34.959
[SPEAKER_04]: Because my week sucked.

34:35.099 --> 34:35.579
[SPEAKER_14]: Fuck your week.

34:36.687 --> 34:42.310
[SPEAKER_04]: I give you permission to speak, oh Rob, who sits by the computer, with your legs all crossed, you need a cigarette now, you are so like...

34:54.018 --> 34:59.686
[SPEAKER_04]: You were the most supportive of me stopping smoking, and now you're like, you want a cigar tonight?

34:59.726 --> 35:02.409
[SPEAKER_14]: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

35:03.090 --> 35:07.917
[SPEAKER_14]: I do not believe in cigarettes, because cigarettes are very addicting.

35:08.377 --> 35:10.418
[SPEAKER_04]: I do have my secret hidden stash.

35:11.058 --> 35:14.319
[SPEAKER_14]: Claims I'm fine with, because you best be hooking me up with that.

35:15.620 --> 35:25.084
[SPEAKER_14]: I have found out from my fiance, he's not really happy about it, but he is okay with me having a cigar every so often.

35:25.704 --> 35:29.345
[SPEAKER_14]: So I picked up a pack of Black Milds, because they're pipe tobacco.

35:29.425 --> 35:29.605
[SPEAKER_14]: Nope.

35:30.005 --> 35:31.446
[SPEAKER_14]: And pipe tobacco is sexy.

35:31.506 --> 35:33.367
[SPEAKER_04]: We really don't endorse smoking, boys and girls.

35:33.407 --> 35:33.827
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't start.

35:33.847 --> 35:34.047
[SPEAKER_04]: Select!

35:35.728 --> 35:36.689
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't start, kids.

35:36.989 --> 35:37.849
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a nasty habit.

35:38.149 --> 35:42.932
[SPEAKER_14]: It is a nasty habit, and if you have your lungs full of tar, we'll laugh at you when you croak.

35:44.373 --> 35:45.553
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, tell us about your week, Rob.

35:45.593 --> 35:46.714
[SPEAKER_14]: I bet it was fascinating.

35:46.814 --> 35:49.956
[SPEAKER_04]: No, my car was broken into for the second time this week.

35:50.096 --> 35:51.116
[SPEAKER_04]: You should move.

35:51.177 --> 35:55.739
[SPEAKER_04]: This time they smashed a window, and they took my new stereo that the insurance company had replaced.

35:56.199 --> 35:58.861
[SPEAKER_04]: They dug through my car until they found my faceplate.

35:58.901 --> 36:04.664
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, okay, stupid me for keeping my faceplate in my car, but I had it in a secret spot where I didn't think anyone would find it.

36:06.036 --> 36:08.198
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll get the fan in a little bit so it cools off in here.

36:08.698 --> 36:09.379
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, hold on.

36:10.820 --> 36:12.020
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm giving Jamie some competition.

36:12.281 --> 36:13.782
[SPEAKER_14]: You're red in the face, Loki.

36:13.922 --> 36:15.162
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fine in here.

36:15.183 --> 36:16.163
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki, you're red.

36:16.744 --> 36:18.545
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to give you my Zim doll.

36:20.146 --> 36:21.667
[SPEAKER_14]: I have a big plushie Zim pillow.

36:22.387 --> 36:24.329
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do I have a big plushie girl pillow?

36:24.369 --> 36:26.030
[SPEAKER_04]: Our chatroom is www.org.com.

36:26.050 --> 36:27.371
[SPEAKER_04]: Why is the chatroom saying our stream dropped?

36:27.391 --> 36:27.931
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we're still up.

36:28.051 --> 36:28.651
[SPEAKER_04]: We always have it up.

36:34.975 --> 36:35.756
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm always up.

36:37.797 --> 36:40.579
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't make me waste my vodka by spitting it on your face.

36:40.599 --> 36:42.840
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even want to discuss stuff like that.

36:44.682 --> 36:45.923
[SPEAKER_04]: Just because, yeah.

36:46.183 --> 36:46.883
[SPEAKER_04]: What happened?

36:48.444 --> 36:49.865
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's not what happened.

36:51.166 --> 36:55.989
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not going to go there because that's a little, you know, beyond the show format here, okay?

36:56.310 --> 36:59.132
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not, you know, let's talk about Loki's sex life.

36:59.192 --> 37:00.573
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not a bad thing either.

37:00.633 --> 37:02.554
[SPEAKER_04]: It's good stuff, but, you know, it's just,

37:04.017 --> 37:06.399
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a side effect to having a cold.

37:07.140 --> 37:08.481
[SPEAKER_04]: I get a weird side effect.

37:09.542 --> 37:11.665
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, it's just odd.

37:13.146 --> 37:14.548
[SPEAKER_24]: We're not going to talk about it, okay?

37:16.550 --> 37:17.871
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know what he's laughing about.

37:17.891 --> 37:19.333
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we get Nelly in here to clarify?

37:19.353 --> 37:19.433
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

37:20.885 --> 37:22.948
[SPEAKER_04]: I can tell you what it is, but I'm not sure.

37:22.968 --> 37:24.390
[SPEAKER_14]: I have a replacement for Dunk.

37:24.591 --> 37:25.652
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think the listeners want to hear it.

37:25.672 --> 37:26.393
[SPEAKER_14]: It's in the chat room.

37:26.413 --> 37:27.455
[SPEAKER_14]: I have a replacement for Dunk.

37:27.876 --> 37:28.316
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that?

37:28.677 --> 37:28.997
[SPEAKER_14]: Dirk.

37:29.618 --> 37:29.939
[SPEAKER_04]: Dirk?

37:30.459 --> 37:30.760
[SPEAKER_04]: Dirk?

37:31.361 --> 37:31.661
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

37:32.062 --> 37:33.023
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, um...

37:34.960 --> 37:35.320
[SPEAKER_04]: What was it?

37:35.340 --> 37:36.340
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my car got broken into.

37:36.680 --> 37:40.502
[SPEAKER_04]: And this time, instead of just prying open the door, they actually smashed one of my windows.

37:40.802 --> 37:44.123
[SPEAKER_04]: And the insurance company won't replace my broken window until a week from today.

37:44.803 --> 37:45.563
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't that stupid?

37:45.843 --> 37:46.723
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm driving around.

37:47.023 --> 37:53.325
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and to add insult to injury, they fucked up my lock on the driver's side, so I can't even open my driver door.

37:53.345 --> 38:00.167
[SPEAKER_04]: So I get into my car, I have to open up the passenger door, climb my fat ass across the seat, and then I get to sit down.

38:00.587 --> 38:01.368
[SPEAKER_04]: Sucks.

38:01.408 --> 38:04.069
[SPEAKER_04]: Did they fuck up the lock on the outside or the lock all together?

38:05.630 --> 38:06.911
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't open the door from the inside.

38:06.931 --> 38:11.654
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, because my old car used to have to pop open the door on the passenger side, unlock the door, and then walk around.

38:11.754 --> 38:12.634
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it won't even work.

38:13.274 --> 38:17.797
[SPEAKER_04]: Because some dumbass tried to open the lock with a screwdriver and that didn't work.

38:17.817 --> 38:20.759
[SPEAKER_04]: My door won't even open from the... I don't even know how they're going to fix it.

38:20.899 --> 38:21.459
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be incredible.

38:21.779 --> 38:22.460
[SPEAKER_23]: But it's great, though.

38:22.500 --> 38:25.462
[SPEAKER_23]: See, my old car, they were trying to steal the stock stereo.

38:25.502 --> 38:27.523
[SPEAKER_14]: I have to tell something to Illusion real quick.

38:27.683 --> 38:27.923
[SPEAKER_14]: What?

38:28.623 --> 38:29.064
[SPEAKER_16]: What?

38:33.820 --> 38:35.720
[SPEAKER_23]: I saw that movie, it's great.

38:35.740 --> 38:36.620
[SPEAKER_23]: Here's my ferret impersonation.

39:03.959 --> 39:04.799
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so that was my week.

39:04.839 --> 39:05.739
[SPEAKER_04]: My car got broken into.

39:05.759 --> 39:05.980
[SPEAKER_04]: That sucks.

39:06.000 --> 39:07.400
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not an impersonation.

39:07.940 --> 39:08.620
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut up!

39:09.100 --> 39:12.201
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll talk about this more on the podcast if I can, if I'm not too insanely drunk.

39:12.501 --> 39:14.802
[SPEAKER_04]: But I was playing Meteos all week.

39:14.842 --> 39:15.602
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you finally got that?

39:15.782 --> 39:17.262
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it just came out this past week.

39:17.282 --> 39:17.642
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I know.

39:18.242 --> 39:18.923
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so hot.

39:19.083 --> 39:19.443
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.

39:19.523 --> 39:22.243
[SPEAKER_04]: Meteos is like the reason why there's a DS.

39:22.964 --> 39:24.464
[SPEAKER_04]: Meteos makes... I'm gonna...

39:26.118 --> 39:27.239
[SPEAKER_04]: Shove that thing up your ass.

39:29.140 --> 39:31.682
[SPEAKER_04]: Meteos is the reason why they made a DS, seriously.

39:32.343 --> 39:35.585
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything good about the DS technology is used in Meteos.

39:35.666 --> 39:36.026
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.

39:36.786 --> 39:38.548
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to make sweet love to it and have its babies.

39:40.749 --> 39:42.891
[SPEAKER_04]: And those babies will be Nintendogs.

39:43.692 --> 39:45.093
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, hey, Illusion, guess what?

39:49.798 --> 39:56.000
[SPEAKER_04]: If I could stab this microphone to my brain, I'd do it right now, but since that's impossible.

39:56.300 --> 40:02.463
[SPEAKER_04]: To answer a question in chat room, somebody's saying that in response to my car getting broken into, they said, that's what insurance is for.

40:02.843 --> 40:09.025
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, well, I still have a $100 deductible, which sucks, and they'll probably jack up my rates because it's the second time my car's been broken into.

40:09.045 --> 40:11.926
[SPEAKER_14]: This is because you moved into Rancho Cambodia.

40:14.387 --> 40:17.888
[SPEAKER_14]: I swear, like, they're trying to...

40:20.755 --> 40:26.520
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

40:42.961 --> 40:44.182
[SPEAKER_14]: I like you, chat room person.

40:44.482 --> 40:45.103
[SPEAKER_04]: That was Misty.

40:45.703 --> 40:47.365
[SPEAKER_04]: Misty, you were awesome.

40:47.445 --> 40:49.126
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got music with me.

40:49.327 --> 40:50.287
[SPEAKER_04]: Because this is a segue.

40:50.628 --> 40:51.348
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a good segue.

40:51.408 --> 40:53.871
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we're going to talk about Akira Yamaoka when we come back, if we can.

40:54.131 --> 40:55.692
[SPEAKER_04]: I need Kutima DXY.

40:56.593 --> 40:57.534
[SPEAKER_04]: If I can find it.

40:57.794 --> 40:58.394
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do it again.

40:58.434 --> 40:58.695
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

40:59.175 --> 41:01.857
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, this song's like four minutes, or five minutes, so we're going to play it.

41:01.877 --> 41:03.359
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to come back and talk about Akira.

41:03.519 --> 41:04.420
[SPEAKER_14]: Do that and then play...

41:07.262 --> 41:08.263
[SPEAKER_14]: What's that other one?

41:09.443 --> 41:10.964
[SPEAKER_14]: The one that's named after a Beatles song.

41:11.004 --> 41:11.564
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me do it.

41:12.005 --> 41:12.665
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll see what we can do.

41:12.705 --> 41:12.965
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

41:13.345 --> 41:16.207
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll get some music, and then we'll be back with more Orange Launcher.

41:16.227 --> 41:17.547
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're going to open up the Skype line.

41:17.587 --> 41:22.650
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you guys want to talk to us in our, what's the word?

41:23.190 --> 41:24.031
[SPEAKER_04]: Drunken state?

41:24.051 --> 41:24.311
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess.

41:24.391 --> 41:26.172
[SPEAKER_04]: Drunken, inebriated, I don't know, state.

41:26.512 --> 41:27.833
[SPEAKER_04]: You will have the opportunity when we come back.

41:27.853 --> 41:29.954
[SPEAKER_04]: Go to orangelauncher.com and interact with us.

41:30.994 --> 41:31.815
[SPEAKER_03]: They said I looked pink.

41:32.571 --> 41:32.992
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

41:33.112 --> 41:34.295
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, we'll be back after this.

41:34.636 --> 41:37.884
[SPEAKER_04]: Your Rain, the Rage Mix from Akira Yamaoka, because we're going to talk about him when we come back.

41:38.907 --> 41:39.368
[SPEAKER_03]: Akira.

41:39.408 --> 41:40.230
[SPEAKER_04]: And how hot he is.

41:40.591 --> 41:41.052
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be back.

41:41.253 --> 41:41.734
[SPEAKER_04]: Okie dokie.

43:14.392 --> 43:15.193
Thanks for watching!

43:51.616 --> 44:05.441
I'm a sidewalk, I'm a city, I'm a creature, I'm a whisper Is it people, or are we nowhere?

44:05.461 --> 44:07.201
[SPEAKER_16]: There is no glory, no compassion

44:48.451 --> 44:55.297
[SPEAKER_16]: Out of my head, and I don't know where to go Over and over, I feel the break with God

45:27.074 --> 45:33.682
On the sidewalk of the city, on the streets of the river, there's a people going nowhere, see me talking all right.

45:33.702 --> 45:39.169
There's a passion, there's a matter, my resistance is waving, like a flower in the basement.

47:03.233 --> 47:05.302
Thank you for watching

48:25.799 --> 48:29.743
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello out there, this is Rob, but you might know me in the online world as Sky.

48:30.284 --> 48:40.935
[SPEAKER_04]: On June 23rd at 7pm Pacific Time, join DarkSakura and I for the Orange Lounge, the Bomani Scene's newest talk radio program, where we'll talk about all the latest in everything Bomani.

48:41.415 --> 48:45.620
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a whole show dedicated to those games that we never shut up about.

48:50.018 --> 48:52.102
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura.

48:52.182 --> 48:54.305
[SPEAKER_14]: Why the fuck did you play that one?

48:54.326 --> 48:55.187
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura.

48:55.267 --> 48:57.671
[SPEAKER_14]: Rob, put out your hand.

48:59.500 --> 49:00.400
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura DarkSakura

49:25.720 --> 49:27.362
[SPEAKER_14]: Alan didn't want to come out.

49:27.902 --> 49:29.303
[SPEAKER_04]: That burp didn't want to come out.

49:47.085 --> 49:48.846
[SPEAKER_04]: So, it's been huge for us.

49:48.906 --> 49:55.828
[SPEAKER_04]: We have so many more listeners now, thanks to iTunes making it really easy to subscribe to podcasts.

49:55.848 --> 49:58.009
[SPEAKER_04]: We have like a million listeners.

49:58.029 --> 49:59.489
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a sobering belch.

50:00.910 --> 50:04.051
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, for those of you guys keeping track at home, I am on shots 6, 7, 8, and 9.

50:05.390 --> 50:08.052
[SPEAKER_04]: Dan is going to be here before too long with my pants.

50:26.659 --> 50:29.840
[SPEAKER_06]: Arcanium 42 made the funniest joke in the chatroom.

50:29.860 --> 50:30.320
[SPEAKER_06]: Dark Lekura.

50:30.340 --> 50:30.880
[SPEAKER_06]: That is not funny.

50:30.920 --> 50:31.521
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't laugh.

50:31.561 --> 50:32.261
[SPEAKER_14]: I laughed a lot.

50:32.281 --> 50:33.501
[SPEAKER_14]: The diva says it's not funny.

50:33.941 --> 50:34.722
[SPEAKER_11]: Too bad.

50:34.742 --> 50:35.002
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

50:53.703 --> 50:55.965
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki was not a part of the show when we first started.

50:56.225 --> 50:57.666
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right, I was a guest.

50:57.786 --> 50:59.007
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki has to wait for us through Berlin.

50:59.027 --> 50:59.988
[SPEAKER_04]: He had to sit on the floor.

51:00.068 --> 51:05.533
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki was a guest host for 19 episodes, and then we were like, well, what the fuck, we'll make him a host.

51:05.953 --> 51:09.796
[SPEAKER_04]: But I feel bad for Angel, because Angel's now been a guest for probably like 50 shows.

51:09.836 --> 51:11.398
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, she stopped showing up, though.

51:12.659 --> 51:13.459
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, where is she?

51:14.340 --> 51:18.782
[SPEAKER_04]: She wanted to come tonight, but because of my car break-in, I couldn't provide her transportation after tonight's show.

51:19.062 --> 51:19.942
[SPEAKER_04]: She's listening, I'm sure.

51:20.363 --> 51:21.623
[SPEAKER_04]: Or she's getting an archive of the show.

51:21.983 --> 51:27.666
[SPEAKER_04]: But now DDR Angel's been sitting on the floor for like 50 episodes, and now we're like, oh, three's too many.

51:29.027 --> 51:29.807
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, DDR Angel.

51:29.827 --> 51:32.148
[SPEAKER_04]: She's a chronicle.

51:32.548 --> 51:33.709
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, she's our chronic guest.

51:34.669 --> 51:35.890
[SPEAKER_04]: The chronic, yo!

51:35.990 --> 51:36.850
[SPEAKER_04]: She's our chronic.

51:37.210 --> 51:38.031
[SPEAKER_04]: She's a blunt, yo.

51:38.871 --> 51:40.272
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm gonna have more liquor.

51:40.854 --> 51:41.794
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

51:42.514 --> 51:43.615
[SPEAKER_14]: I get to pee first.

51:45.535 --> 51:48.276
[SPEAKER_04]: Should I open up the Skype line or should I talk about the Akira Yamaoka album?

51:48.416 --> 51:49.196
[SPEAKER_24]: Akira Yamaoka.

51:49.336 --> 51:50.197
[SPEAKER_04]: Akira Yamaoka.

51:50.217 --> 51:51.757
[SPEAKER_04]: Akira Yamaoka is getting his own album.

51:51.877 --> 51:54.778
[SPEAKER_04]: It's coming out October 28th in Japan.

51:54.798 --> 51:57.479
[SPEAKER_04]: Akira Yamaoka, by the way, did the songs on his last break.

51:58.139 --> 52:02.440
[SPEAKER_04]: Akira Yamaoka, famous for his DDR music, beat mania music, as well as Silent Hill.

52:02.480 --> 52:02.920
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.

52:03.400 --> 52:04.000
[SPEAKER_04]: What else has he done?

52:04.040 --> 52:05.281
[SPEAKER_04]: He did some music for Contra.

52:05.361 --> 52:05.861
[SPEAKER_04]: Contra is.

52:06.361 --> 52:07.002
[SPEAKER_04]: Shattered Soldier

52:35.930 --> 52:40.780
[SPEAKER_04]: And they didn't say anything about Silent Hill songs, but of course Silent Hill already has their own soundtrack, so who cares, right?

52:41.742 --> 52:46.792
[SPEAKER_04]: We have, let's see, two Bomani songs, six cover songs.

52:47.864 --> 52:49.945
[SPEAKER_04]: Which could be just about anything.

52:50.586 --> 52:54.968
[SPEAKER_04]: I know what some of those... Two brand new songs.

52:55.268 --> 52:57.710
[SPEAKER_04]: I know what some of those cover songs are.

52:57.730 --> 52:58.350
[SPEAKER_04]: You think you do.

52:58.630 --> 52:59.511
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't know for sure.

52:59.571 --> 53:00.271
[SPEAKER_04]: You think you might.

53:00.291 --> 53:01.592
[SPEAKER_00]: I suspect with some of those.

53:01.952 --> 53:03.373
[SPEAKER_00]: But I can't say anything, of course.

53:03.613 --> 53:04.473
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyways.

53:05.574 --> 53:07.695
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, I mean, Kiriyama is awesome.

53:07.735 --> 53:09.416
[SPEAKER_04]: So whatever he's going to do is going to be awesome.

53:09.576 --> 53:10.217
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, that's right.

53:10.377 --> 53:10.537
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

53:13.337 --> 53:13.898
[SPEAKER_04]: It should be fun.

53:13.918 --> 53:14.518
[SPEAKER_04]: It should be fun.

53:14.618 --> 53:19.121
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you want more information on that, KonamiStyle.jp has a whole page dedicated to the project.

53:19.741 --> 53:20.882
[SPEAKER_04]: So it should be pretty awesome.

53:21.322 --> 53:21.862
[SPEAKER_04]: So check it out.

53:22.463 --> 53:27.505
[SPEAKER_04]: I am really dizzy.

53:28.986 --> 53:29.406
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

53:31.208 --> 53:32.448
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, good point from John Fields.

53:32.468 --> 53:36.511
[SPEAKER_04]: We can make Angel the intern since Zero doesn't show up to the show anymore.

53:36.891 --> 53:38.312
[SPEAKER_04]: Wasn't Magus our intern at one point?

53:38.492 --> 53:40.373
[SPEAKER_04]: No, he's the eternal freshman of Orange Launch.

53:40.393 --> 53:40.693
[SPEAKER_04]: I forgot.

53:41.115 --> 54:01.851
[SPEAKER_04]: He's the keeper of the Portuguese joke book That's right, he's the Portuguese joke book keeper Oh man, I am so dizzy I thought this was interesting, the story you posted earlier this week We'll probably talk about this more on the podcast But the PlayStation 3, $400 to buy a PlayStation 3?

54:01.931 --> 54:03.973
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it going to do my dishes?

54:04.533 --> 54:05.514
[SPEAKER_04]: If not, fuck it

54:06.550 --> 54:10.111
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you do have to understand the Xbox 360 games are $60 each.

54:10.391 --> 54:11.871
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my, that is insane.

54:12.051 --> 54:12.672
[SPEAKER_04]: That is insane.

54:14.032 --> 54:17.653
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, D of A is pretty, or D of A, it's like a bank suddenly.

54:18.073 --> 54:22.694
[SPEAKER_04]: D or A, Dead or Alive, is pretty cool, but it's not $60 cool.

54:23.454 --> 54:24.395
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's not.

54:25.335 --> 54:29.776
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is what I've got from, like, you know, basically looking at the release dates we have for the...

54:32.196 --> 54:34.637
[SPEAKER_04]: The Xbox 360 is coming out around November 15th.

54:54.710 --> 54:58.374
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, it's going to be about $60 a game for the Xbox 360.

54:58.774 --> 55:01.857
[SPEAKER_04]: I can only assume that the PlayStation 3 stuff is going to be about the same price.

55:01.917 --> 55:05.621
[SPEAKER_04]: If they wanted to be cute, since it's 360, they would release it on March 60th.

55:07.913 --> 55:08.554
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think so.

55:08.894 --> 55:09.875
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not going to happen.

55:10.316 --> 55:13.459
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they're going to release it on November 16th or 15th.

55:13.939 --> 55:14.580
[SPEAKER_04]: It's around there.

55:14.800 --> 55:19.425
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, because obviously dates change for the games a lot, so it's up in the air.

55:19.505 --> 55:23.389
[SPEAKER_04]: But most of the publishers are saying that's going to happen at that date.

55:23.449 --> 55:26.932
[SPEAKER_04]: In our chat room, Baka is saying that the games on PS3 are going to be $60 too.

55:26.952 --> 55:29.375
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so it wouldn't be a surprise.

55:30.930 --> 55:32.951
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't spend $50 on a game either.

55:33.031 --> 55:35.433
[SPEAKER_04]: I spent $35 on Meteos and that was like having to give up a finger.

55:35.453 --> 55:37.214
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, most PlayStation 2 games are like $49.99.

55:37.294 --> 55:38.334
[SPEAKER_04]: Not when I buy them.

55:38.414 --> 55:40.956
[SPEAKER_06]: And they wonder why people try to pirate their games.

55:56.623 --> 55:57.624
[SPEAKER_04]: $50 for a game.

55:58.225 --> 55:59.586
[SPEAKER_04]: What about Katamari Damacy?

55:59.667 --> 56:02.309
[SPEAKER_04]: Great game, $20, sold zillions of copies.

56:02.710 --> 56:02.309
$20.

56:02.750 --> 56:04.511
[SPEAKER_04]: That should be a model for all games.

56:04.592 --> 56:05.733
[SPEAKER_04]: Second game, though, was $29.99.

56:05.833 --> 56:06.854
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we raised $10, so...

56:10.231 --> 56:11.992
[SPEAKER_04]: But still though, it's worth the extra 10 bucks.

56:12.052 --> 56:13.632
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still not, you know, 44 or 49.99.

56:13.672 --> 56:21.155
[SPEAKER_04]: Not if they're putting out games like, I don't know, what's a game that sucked on PlayStation?

56:22.535 --> 56:23.075
[SPEAKER_04]: Driver 3.

56:23.696 --> 56:24.756
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, Driver 3.

56:25.076 --> 56:26.957
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm gonna pay 60 bucks for Driver 4.

56:29.627 --> 56:33.769
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I would pay $60 for Final Fantasy XII, although that's supposedly going to be on.

56:33.789 --> 56:37.531
[SPEAKER_04]: The Driver series sucked after the first game.

56:37.852 --> 56:43.295
[SPEAKER_04]: The second game just sucked ass, and the third game was just... It was so bad it was funny.

56:43.875 --> 56:45.837
[SPEAKER_04]: But, I don't know.

56:46.977 --> 56:51.180
[SPEAKER_04]: They think they can justify that amount for the next-gen consoles, because...

56:51.520 --> 56:52.802
[SPEAKER_04]: The graphics are better!

56:54.485 --> 56:58.772
[SPEAKER_04]: Game companies, this is why people hack your shit, because you're charging too much for your damn games.

56:59.272 --> 57:02.477
[SPEAKER_14]: It'll probably cost them more to actually make these games.

57:04.901 --> 57:10.443
[SPEAKER_14]: Part of the cost involved with the creation of the games also has to do with fighting loss of profit.

57:10.483 --> 57:11.123
[SPEAKER_14]: They have to make...

57:24.208 --> 57:29.610
[SPEAKER_14]: For a company to be considered successful, they have to make a certain amount over production cost.

57:30.431 --> 57:38.975
[SPEAKER_14]: Therefore, they are trying to accommodate for what they have already lost versus what they may stand to lose and do their prices accordingly.

57:39.515 --> 57:44.397
[SPEAKER_14]: Therefore, a $10 markup in price is not unreasonable nor is it unexpected.

57:45.595 --> 57:46.977
[SPEAKER_04]: What other things could I buy for $60?

57:47.478 --> 57:49.220
[SPEAKER_04]: All the liquor I bought tonight was $40.

57:49.501 --> 57:52.004
[SPEAKER_04]: That's more fun than Driver 3.

57:52.485 --> 57:54.367
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay, because basically games have been about $50 since...

57:56.374 --> 57:58.296
[SPEAKER_04]: Even the Super Nintendo.

57:58.456 --> 58:01.879
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember when Street Fighter was like a $70 game.

58:01.999 --> 58:04.421
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, that's ridiculous.

58:04.601 --> 58:08.544
[SPEAKER_04]: I could get a GameCube for $70 now.

58:08.944 --> 58:11.226
[SPEAKER_04]: That's ridiculous for Street Fighter being that expensive.

58:11.506 --> 58:15.790
[SPEAKER_04]: But I remember most of my Super Nintendo games being about $49.99.

58:16.991 --> 58:18.892
[SPEAKER_04]: It hasn't really changed that much since then.

58:18.992 --> 58:22.955
[SPEAKER_14]: I paid $60 for Killer Instinct when it came out on the Super Nintendo.

58:22.975 --> 58:23.856
[SPEAKER_14]: That's bullshit.

58:25.217 --> 58:26.920
[SPEAKER_04]: This was a shitty port.

58:27.582 --> 58:31.348
[SPEAKER_14]: This was ten years ago that I bought this damn game.

58:32.029 --> 58:34.073
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, with inflation and everything, that's like $80 now.

58:34.794 --> 58:37.439
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously though, $60 isn't that bad.

58:37.499 --> 58:38.461
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, when you consider it.

58:38.891 --> 58:43.373
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the system being $400, yeah, that kind of sucks.

58:43.833 --> 58:53.496
[SPEAKER_04]: But I would hope that this would be a little bit better than, you know, it's going to be playing the next-gen, like, whatever the media is going to be, like, HD, DVD, or Blu-ray, or whatever.

58:53.997 --> 58:54.917
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be playing that.

58:54.957 --> 58:58.478
[SPEAKER_04]: So you've basically got, you know, next-gen players in that sense.

58:58.838 --> 58:59.519
[SPEAKER_04]: You've also got...

59:00.559 --> 59:01.519
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't understand this.

59:01.599 --> 59:05.140
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, PlayStation 3, for some reason, had, like, three Ethernet ports on there.

59:05.280 --> 59:09.041
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what the hell that's for, but I'm sure they're going to use it for something.

59:09.281 --> 59:11.262
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, I don't know.

59:11.502 --> 59:14.643
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, you know, $399 for the system isn't that bad.

59:15.003 --> 59:18.124
[SPEAKER_04]: People are going to be like, eh, it's kind of expensive, but they're going to pay for it.

59:18.484 --> 59:25.705
[SPEAKER_04]: But the Revolution, though, they're saying is going to be cheaper, much like how, you know, the DS was only $151, the PSP was, like, you know, $300, you know, so...

59:28.902 --> 59:36.787
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, people might, if they're really, you know, concerned about costs, they'll pay for the, you know, the Revolution versus the PS3 or the, um, 360.

59:37.268 --> 59:40.530
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to read some comments in the chat, or moreinsolventradio.com, click on chat.

59:40.610 --> 59:45.293
[SPEAKER_04]: I gotta go get more alcohol, because I'm dizzy as hell, and if I drink some more, I might pass out.

59:45.313 --> 59:45.693
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be good.

59:45.853 --> 59:51.617
[SPEAKER_04]: Sakurina says, uh, I could buy a lot of, and if I mispronounce that, my apologies, at least I didn't say, um, Sakurina.

59:52.598 --> 59:56.820
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I could buy a lot of Kleenex for $60 and could have more fun than Driver 3.

59:58.002 --> 01:00:03.180
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree, I could buy toilet paper and make a mess of somebody's lawn and that would be more fun than Driver 3.

01:00:03.996 --> 01:00:06.177
[SPEAKER_14]: I grabbed my booze instead of my microphone.

01:00:06.737 --> 01:00:07.838
[SPEAKER_14]: What's wrong with this picture?

01:00:07.858 --> 01:00:08.378
[SPEAKER_14]: That's good.

01:00:08.598 --> 01:00:11.839
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I could wipe my ass and have more fun than Driver 3 was.

01:00:12.460 --> 01:00:15.301
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, DarkSakura, you're the resident Sega whore.

01:00:15.881 --> 01:00:17.962
[SPEAKER_04]: Our resident Sega man whore in the chatroom.

01:00:17.982 --> 01:00:20.923
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I think there's two of them, because I think John Fields is a big Sega man whore, too.

01:00:20.963 --> 01:00:29.427
[SPEAKER_04]: But the other one that I know of, this local Arcadian42, huge Sega man whore, says Phantasy Star 4 was $100 when it first came out.

01:00:29.467 --> 01:00:29.887
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that true?

01:00:30.547 --> 01:00:40.899
[SPEAKER_04]: Final Fantasy II was $80, says John Fields.

01:00:41.260 --> 01:00:42.060
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's right.

01:00:42.121 --> 01:00:43.282
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I remember paying like $70.

01:00:43.382 --> 01:00:44.643
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I didn't pay it.

01:00:44.683 --> 01:00:47.066
[SPEAKER_04]: I begged my mommy because I got straight A's.

01:00:48.468 --> 01:00:49.889
[SPEAKER_14]: You need a nerdlet.

01:00:50.993 --> 01:00:52.274
[SPEAKER_04]: I got straight A's.

01:00:52.695 --> 01:00:55.637
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you want to hear about my junior high school experience and straight A's?

01:00:56.037 --> 01:00:57.959
[SPEAKER_04]: I got all A's.

01:00:58.039 --> 01:01:04.885
[SPEAKER_04]: My first semester of junior high school, I got all A's and a B and P. But my parents never cared about P. So they always threw that out.

01:01:04.905 --> 01:01:05.525
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't count that.

01:01:05.906 --> 01:01:09.249
[SPEAKER_04]: But my mom would go, you got an A minus in math?

01:01:11.310 --> 01:01:12.271
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what I got?

01:01:12.291 --> 01:01:16.235
[SPEAKER_14]: A D and a C because I didn't give a fuck.

01:01:18.214 --> 01:01:19.535
[SPEAKER_14]: My school bored me.

01:01:20.256 --> 01:01:25.400
[SPEAKER_14]: And I would make A's on all of my tests, but get zeros for homework because I wouldn't fucking do it.

01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:26.341
[SPEAKER_04]: That was me too.

01:01:26.421 --> 01:01:27.302
[SPEAKER_04]: I never did my homework.

01:01:27.822 --> 01:01:28.603
[SPEAKER_04]: I was a bad boy.

01:01:30.104 --> 01:01:32.146
[SPEAKER_04]: That first semester of junior high, it went all downhill from there.

01:01:32.346 --> 01:01:35.008
[SPEAKER_04]: I just started not doing homework and stuff, and I slacked off.

01:01:35.849 --> 01:01:37.350
[SPEAKER_04]: And look where I'm at now, kids.

01:01:38.071 --> 01:01:39.932
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm on an internet radio station.

01:01:41.113 --> 01:01:42.394
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to be like me?

01:01:42.535 --> 01:01:44.036
[SPEAKER_14]: We're fucking celebrities.

01:01:44.816 --> 01:01:46.418
[SPEAKER_14]: Because we didn't do well in school.

01:01:48.854 --> 01:01:51.136
[SPEAKER_04]: Baka wants to know how I got a B in PE.

01:01:51.716 --> 01:01:55.078
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I could run a mile in like 14 minutes.

01:01:55.499 --> 01:01:57.140
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how I got a B in PE.

01:01:59.681 --> 01:02:02.403
[SPEAKER_04]: My best friend in junior high and I used to walk the mile every day.

01:02:03.284 --> 01:02:06.086
[SPEAKER_04]: We would run until the teacher couldn't see us anymore, then we'd walk the rest of it.

01:02:06.506 --> 01:02:06.966
[SPEAKER_04]: It's awesome.

01:02:07.106 --> 01:02:11.189
[SPEAKER_14]: One time, just to prove I could do it, I sprinted a half mile.

01:02:12.670 --> 01:02:13.711
[SPEAKER_14]: Just to prove I could do it.

01:02:15.492 --> 01:02:17.634
[SPEAKER_04]: I would barf if I ever tried that.

01:02:18.427 --> 01:02:18.947
[SPEAKER_04]: You're horrible.

01:02:19.668 --> 01:02:20.469
[SPEAKER_14]: I ran for it.

01:02:20.529 --> 01:02:21.870
[SPEAKER_14]: I was so tired by the time I got there.

01:02:22.190 --> 01:02:23.711
[SPEAKER_14]: But I beat everybody, damn it.

01:02:25.153 --> 01:02:28.115
[SPEAKER_14]: And now I can't run because I'm injured.

01:02:29.977 --> 01:02:31.278
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to make an announcement here.

01:02:31.318 --> 01:02:34.180
[SPEAKER_04]: I think if the site's still up right now, because the site's been going up and down.

01:02:34.260 --> 01:02:34.701
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, never mind.

01:02:35.261 --> 01:02:35.541
[SPEAKER_04]: Never mind.

01:02:35.802 --> 01:02:36.422
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll talk about it later.

01:02:37.063 --> 01:02:37.403
[SPEAKER_04]: It's down.

01:02:39.565 --> 01:02:40.385
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to...

01:02:43.137 --> 01:02:45.260
[SPEAKER_04]: Baka says I'm in the chatroom.

01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:51.871
[SPEAKER_04]: Baka in our chatroom says, and our chatroom's over at www.orangeloungeradio.com.

01:02:52.251 --> 01:02:54.915
[SPEAKER_04]: Click on, what is it, chat?

01:02:54.935 --> 01:02:55.016
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

01:02:56.913 --> 01:02:59.114
[SPEAKER_04]: I cannot believe that you were drunk off of that.

01:02:59.895 --> 01:03:01.256
[SPEAKER_04]: Baka says, I'm Asian.

01:03:01.436 --> 01:03:03.377
[SPEAKER_04]: I get 3.6s and 4.0s.

01:03:04.557 --> 01:03:06.658
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to hear from an Asian who gets shitty grades.

01:03:07.059 --> 01:03:07.579
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously.

01:03:08.099 --> 01:03:11.941
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to hear from somebody who defies the stereotype and gets like Cs and Ds.

01:03:12.342 --> 01:03:15.363
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that's a messed up stereotype that all Asians get like good grades.

01:03:15.743 --> 01:03:18.765
[SPEAKER_04]: Surely there's a flunky Asian out there somewhere and I want to hear from them.

01:03:22.587 --> 01:03:25.849
[SPEAKER_04]: www.OrangeLaunchRadio.com Click on interact with us.

01:03:27.202 --> 01:03:28.642
[SPEAKER_04]: if you want to call us on the skypline.

[SPEAKER_04]: Talk to us.

01:03:33.243 --> 01:03:34.204
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been drinking a little bit.

01:03:34.484 --> 01:03:36.584
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki's taking way too long with his next drinks.

01:03:38.264 --> 01:03:38.524
[SPEAKER_04]: Man.

01:03:39.025 --> 01:03:40.285
[SPEAKER_14]: He's talking about puking.

01:03:40.525 --> 01:03:41.945
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm hearing him talking about puking, too.

01:03:42.865 --> 01:03:47.967
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, somebody in our chatroom disputing us there saying we're not celebrities, but we're close.

01:03:48.247 --> 01:03:49.807
[SPEAKER_14]: We are two fucking celebrities.

01:03:52.045 --> 01:03:54.807
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't we have pages upon pages of internet stuff?

01:03:54.827 --> 01:03:55.987
[SPEAKER_04]: I have 140 friends on Myspace.

01:03:56.007 --> 01:03:56.868
[SPEAKER_04]: Doesn't that make me a celebrity?

01:03:57.248 --> 01:03:57.408
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

01:03:57.668 --> 01:03:59.950
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that just makes you a big internet nerd.

01:03:59.990 --> 01:04:01.290
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna let you guys in on a secret.

01:04:01.310 --> 01:04:02.071
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a big secret.

01:04:03.312 --> 01:04:05.233
[SPEAKER_19]: We don't really believe the celebrity thing.

01:04:05.293 --> 01:04:06.033
[SPEAKER_19]: It's just a joke.

01:04:06.414 --> 01:04:06.694
Okay?

01:04:07.734 --> 01:04:08.335
Guess what?

01:04:08.555 --> 01:04:08.795
[SPEAKER_19]: What?

01:04:09.115 --> 01:04:11.016
[SPEAKER_16]: I really am a celebrity.

01:04:15.019 --> 01:04:17.240
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki's talking about puke.

01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:18.841
[SPEAKER_13]: Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

01:04:21.238 --> 01:04:23.760
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope we get a call on the skypline at some point.

01:04:23.780 --> 01:04:24.161
[SPEAKER_04]: Skypline!

01:04:24.201 --> 01:04:25.022
[SPEAKER_04]: Fucking call us!

01:04:25.042 --> 01:04:28.845
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to do... Did you hear about Britney Spears?

01:04:28.925 --> 01:04:29.506
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut up, shut up.

01:04:29.626 --> 01:04:31.648
[SPEAKER_04]: She's still smoking and pregnant.

01:04:31.888 --> 01:04:34.590
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, for those keeping drink tally at home, what are you on now?

01:04:34.891 --> 01:04:35.812
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm on 7 and 8.

01:04:36.012 --> 01:04:36.672
[SPEAKER_04]: We're getting a call.

01:04:38.674 --> 01:04:40.996
[SPEAKER_04]: 7 and 8 and I'm very, very, very dizzy.

01:04:41.116 --> 01:04:42.237
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to the phone lines.

01:04:42.278 --> 01:04:43.499
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:04:44.199 --> 01:04:45.200
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey Sky, Siggy here.

01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:46.822
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi Siggy, how are you?

01:04:47.978 --> 01:04:48.919
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm doing fine.

01:04:48.959 --> 01:04:50.380
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy birthday, OLR.

01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:51.381
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

01:04:51.401 --> 01:04:53.062
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate it.

01:04:53.122 --> 01:04:55.124
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob is sounding especially gay today.

01:04:55.244 --> 01:04:56.365
[SPEAKER_04]: We're potty trained now.

01:04:56.385 --> 01:04:58.026
[SPEAKER_04]: We're three years old and we're learning how to read.

01:04:58.647 --> 01:05:00.348
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm a big kid now.

01:05:01.509 --> 01:05:02.610
[SPEAKER_04]: What's on your mind, Siggy?

01:05:03.450 --> 01:05:04.471
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a drink with us, Siggy.

01:05:04.751 --> 01:05:04.932
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you 21?

01:05:04.992 --> 01:05:07.073
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm 25.

01:05:07.714 --> 01:05:07.914
[SPEAKER_04]: Good.

01:05:07.954 --> 01:05:08.855
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a drink with us, Siggy.

01:05:09.602 --> 01:05:11.063
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'd rather have sake, thank you.

01:05:11.363 --> 01:05:11.623
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

01:05:12.004 --> 01:05:12.684
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

01:05:12.704 --> 01:05:14.906
[SPEAKER_04]: I want some sake.

01:05:15.226 --> 01:05:16.166
[SPEAKER_04]: It's too expensive.

01:05:16.206 --> 01:05:16.807
[SPEAKER_04]: I couldn't buy that.

01:05:17.147 --> 01:05:18.788
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, sake, I'm only 30!

01:05:19.228 --> 01:05:20.109
[SPEAKER_04]: Sake, you lady.

01:05:20.449 --> 01:05:21.590
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, bite me.

01:05:21.650 --> 01:05:22.430
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up, Ziggy?

01:05:22.450 --> 01:05:23.071
[SPEAKER_05]: What's on your mind?

01:05:23.646 --> 01:05:28.428
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I got some, uh, announcement, uh, regarding to, uh, Beat Media 2DX12, Happy Sky.

01:05:28.608 --> 01:05:31.129
[SPEAKER_05]: I was gonna say, you had some, you have some news on Happy Sky, don't you?

01:05:31.149 --> 01:05:32.050
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up with Happy Sky?

01:05:33.230 --> 01:05:38.232
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, it's gonna, uh, in Japan, it's gonna be released July 13th, which is gonna be nine days from now.

01:05:38.712 --> 01:05:40.253
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, that's soon, that's awesome.

01:05:40.293 --> 01:05:42.854
[SPEAKER_04]: Are there any, like, new songs that are supposed to be in the final release?

01:05:43.475 --> 01:05:48.317
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause you know how sometimes there's, um, songs in the final release that weren't in the beta test?

01:05:49.917 --> 01:05:50.758
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they doing any of that?

01:05:51.178 --> 01:05:51.278
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

01:05:53.001 --> 01:05:59.708
[SPEAKER_05]: They're already done with the location test, but there haven't been any new songs announced as of late.

01:06:01.130 --> 01:06:03.392
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be great if there was a couple more new ones, though.

01:06:04.734 --> 01:06:05.054
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

01:06:06.376 --> 01:06:14.024
[SPEAKER_05]: And then some other news, like... I don't think this has been announced, but Konami has already made their own record label.

01:06:15.137 --> 01:06:15.517
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

01:06:16.137 --> 01:06:18.118
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's called 573 Records.

01:06:18.698 --> 01:06:20.878
[SPEAKER_05]: That is the most awesome name ever.

01:06:21.418 --> 01:06:22.879
[SPEAKER_05]: I have hiccups now.

01:06:23.559 --> 01:06:25.999
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that what labeled the Akira Yamaoka album is going to come out?

01:06:26.059 --> 01:06:26.859
[SPEAKER_19]: My hand's numb.

01:06:26.939 --> 01:06:35.641
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure, but when I checked the website for 573 Records, they're mostly hip-hop and R&B artists that have signed up for it.

01:06:36.521 --> 01:06:37.662
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the website?

01:06:38.682 --> 01:06:39.062
[SPEAKER_05]: Here it is.

01:06:39.622 --> 01:06:41.382
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me link it on the chat room.

01:06:41.782 --> 01:06:42.363
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, super.

01:06:42.443 --> 01:06:42.703
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

01:06:44.949 --> 01:06:52.552
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, all this talk about Japanese music has me thinking about, did you hear about those huge Live 8 concerts that were going on yesterday?

01:06:52.652 --> 01:06:53.332
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

01:06:54.032 --> 01:06:55.313
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm glad I missed them.

01:06:55.473 --> 01:06:57.353
[SPEAKER_04]: You know who played at the one in Tokyo?

01:06:57.754 --> 01:06:57.934
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

01:06:58.594 --> 01:06:59.434
[SPEAKER_04]: Dreams Come True.

01:07:00.535 --> 01:07:01.695
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god.

01:07:01.915 --> 01:07:02.795
[SPEAKER_04]: That's crazy.

01:07:02.815 --> 01:07:03.276
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.

01:07:03.456 --> 01:07:03.716
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

01:07:04.296 --> 01:07:06.597
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a 21 website, so I'm going to mention it on there.

01:07:06.617 --> 01:07:08.097
[SPEAKER_05]: It's www.onami.jp.mm.573.

01:07:08.117 --> 01:07:08.377
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

01:07:14.057 --> 01:07:15.698
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm going to go look at it right now.

01:07:15.738 --> 01:07:20.461
[SPEAKER_23]: That reminds me, I need to purchase some of the brand new diverse system stuff.

01:07:20.981 --> 01:07:28.726
[SPEAKER_04]: I've kept asking in their stupid bulletin board system whether or not they'll be able to ship this stuff to me because it's not listed on the U.S.

01:07:28.786 --> 01:07:29.667
[SPEAKER_04]: site, but they're U.S.

01:07:30.620 --> 01:07:33.403
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

01:07:49.651 --> 01:07:54.576
[SPEAKER_04]: and Diverse8's out, and then there's Dear Taka and Dear Desire also.

01:07:55.436 --> 01:07:57.058
[SPEAKER_04]: So I need to get those as well.

01:07:57.598 --> 01:08:00.641
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know, D7 I need to get as well.

01:08:01.002 --> 01:08:02.643
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I need to catch up with all their stuff.

01:08:02.683 --> 01:08:07.628
[SPEAKER_04]: And I love, oh my god, I've got to listen to the Trip Machine Dark Core version.

01:08:07.688 --> 01:08:08.348
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that.

01:08:08.469 --> 01:08:12.092
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, 573 Records is a UMA creative production.

01:08:12.152 --> 01:08:14.734
[SPEAKER_04]: That just makes me think that, UMA, UMA!

01:08:15.615 --> 01:08:16.336
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember in Maxx?

01:08:19.506 --> 01:08:20.347
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh... Shut up.

01:08:20.768 --> 01:08:21.448
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

01:08:21.609 --> 01:08:22.810
[SPEAKER_04]: Siggy, you know what I'm talking about, right?

01:08:22.930 --> 01:08:23.971
[SPEAKER_04]: UMA, UMA!

01:08:25.293 --> 01:08:25.754
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

01:08:26.795 --> 01:08:28.937
[SPEAKER_24]: So, my hand's numb.

01:08:28.997 --> 01:08:30.699
[SPEAKER_24]: Is that a bad thing?

01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:31.380
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

01:08:32.321 --> 01:08:33.423
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanna take a nap.

01:08:33.643 --> 01:08:34.224
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I want.

01:08:34.264 --> 01:08:35.986
[SPEAKER_06]: Siggy, what else is on your mind?

01:08:36.877 --> 01:08:41.560
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, um, there's a, yeah, you already know about Dance 86.4, right?

01:08:43.161 --> 01:08:44.942
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that, it's 86.4?

01:08:45.002 --> 01:08:46.584
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought it was like 95, I don't know.

01:08:46.684 --> 01:08:47.364
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, 86.4.

01:08:48.585 --> 01:08:48.905
[SPEAKER_05]: It's 86.4.

01:08:49.065 --> 01:08:55.289
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a, you know, they pronounce it as a Dansuya Royo, or it's translated as a Let's Dance.

01:08:55.610 --> 01:08:55.950
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh-huh.

01:08:56.110 --> 01:08:56.450
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

01:08:56.750 --> 01:08:59.512
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw the news on DDR Freak, and I was just like, you know.

01:08:59.532 --> 01:09:02.514
[SPEAKER_23]: 86.4, wasn't that that stupid game that was coming out?

01:09:02.534 --> 01:09:04.115
[SPEAKER_23]: I remember some.

01:09:04.135 --> 01:09:06.217
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't it like three panel dancing or something?

01:09:06.257 --> 01:09:06.497
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

01:09:07.987 --> 01:09:08.407
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.

01:09:08.527 --> 01:09:08.828
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

01:09:10.749 --> 01:09:20.357
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, I heard about it, but... You know, if I'm going to do any type of, like, three-panel dancing or anything like that, it's going to be, like, from Dance FM or something like that, or whatever that is.

01:09:20.597 --> 01:09:23.139
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm not at Dance FM.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:25.602
[SPEAKER_24]: Neon FM, that's what I meant.

01:09:29.885 --> 01:09:31.266
[SPEAKER_04]: My brain feels numb.

01:09:31.486 --> 01:09:31.747
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

01:09:32.207 --> 01:09:34.369
[SPEAKER_04]: Ziggy, we got other people calling in, so I'm going to let you go.

01:09:34.429 --> 01:09:35.490
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there anything else you want to share with us?

01:09:35.510 --> 01:09:35.830
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all right.

01:09:37.463 --> 01:09:38.787
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing much else.

01:09:39.148 --> 01:09:43.119
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Kiki, thanks for being a loyal fan of ours for at least a year now.

01:09:45.646 --> 01:09:46.507
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, over a year.

01:09:46.527 --> 01:09:47.708
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what, you guys?

01:09:47.868 --> 01:09:49.289
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's something I gotta mention.

01:09:49.309 --> 01:09:51.250
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I've been meaning to do this for a while.

01:09:51.330 --> 01:09:52.571
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on, let me say goodbye to Siggy first.

01:09:52.591 --> 01:09:54.273
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless you're gonna say something to Siggy.

01:09:54.353 --> 01:09:54.933
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this to Siggy?

01:09:55.053 --> 01:09:56.314
[SPEAKER_04]: This is to everyone.

01:09:56.795 --> 01:09:58.016
[SPEAKER_05]: I got nothing much else to say.

01:09:58.236 --> 01:09:59.697
[SPEAKER_05]: Just happy 4th of July.

01:10:00.057 --> 01:10:00.518
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

01:10:00.558 --> 01:10:01.318
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a good one, Siggy.

01:10:01.358 --> 01:10:01.939
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for supporting us.

01:10:01.959 --> 01:10:03.220
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't buy the crappy fireworks.

01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:04.020
[SPEAKER_04]: Stay cool.

01:10:05.902 --> 01:10:10.946
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless you live in the states that have the good... Let him say his piece.

01:10:11.046 --> 01:10:11.646
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, Siggy.

01:10:12.367 --> 01:10:12.547
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

01:10:12.607 --> 01:10:14.529
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't like fireworks anyway, so... Yeah.

01:10:15.550 --> 01:10:16.390
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a good one, Siggy.

01:10:16.430 --> 01:10:18.612
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to let you go, okay?

01:10:18.713 --> 01:10:19.313
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye, Siggy.

01:10:19.573 --> 01:10:20.454
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm very disappointed.

01:10:20.775 --> 01:10:24.498
[SPEAKER_23]: Other states other than California have really kick-ass fireworks.

01:10:25.159 --> 01:10:28.342
[SPEAKER_23]: We have these really shitty ones that burn out in 30 seconds.

01:10:28.722 --> 01:10:32.145
[SPEAKER_04]: But no, they get the ones with the actual mortars and...

01:10:33.416 --> 01:10:34.337
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

01:10:59.212 --> 01:11:00.213
[SPEAKER_04]: What was I going to say?

01:11:00.473 --> 01:11:01.454
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, I'm really drunk.

01:11:02.935 --> 01:11:03.875
[SPEAKER_04]: Then let's take another call.

01:11:04.636 --> 01:11:05.216
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do that.

01:11:05.236 --> 01:11:07.358
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to drink some more.

01:11:08.158 --> 01:11:09.199
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to say hi to the caller.

01:11:14.082 --> 01:11:15.543
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:11:16.604 --> 01:11:18.405
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, is this Sal's Pizza?

01:11:18.945 --> 01:11:21.307
[SPEAKER_04]: No, this is not Sal's Pizza.

01:11:22.188 --> 01:11:23.709
[SPEAKER_27]: Hey Sky, it's John Fields.

01:11:23.829 --> 01:11:25.009
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi John Fields, how are you?

01:11:25.030 --> 01:11:26.811
[SPEAKER_04]: What's on your mind?

01:11:29.502 --> 01:11:31.363
[SPEAKER_27]: Congratulations on making it to three years.

01:11:51.033 --> 01:11:51.994
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm always a bitch.

01:11:52.034 --> 01:11:57.297
[SPEAKER_27]: You guys were, let's see, you were back at the, at that apartment building, I believe.

01:11:57.457 --> 01:11:57.677
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

01:11:57.717 --> 01:11:58.058
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

01:11:58.378 --> 01:11:59.058
[SPEAKER_04]: The pink place.

01:11:59.178 --> 01:12:03.361
[SPEAKER_27]: And at that point, I don't think the machine had been started on by Loki yet.

01:12:05.343 --> 01:12:06.783
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't, no, I don't think it had been.

01:12:08.144 --> 01:12:11.086
[SPEAKER_04]: The time Jon was here, we had that old layout in the old studio.

01:12:11.286 --> 01:12:12.127
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, you know what?

01:12:12.247 --> 01:12:13.888
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to play some more Final Fantasy.

01:12:13.928 --> 01:12:15.629
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been like way too much.

01:12:15.669 --> 01:12:16.290
[SPEAKER_14]: Let Jon talk.

01:12:16.310 --> 01:12:16.370
[SPEAKER_06]: Shh.

01:12:18.689 --> 01:12:19.729
[SPEAKER_14]: Both of you, both of you.

01:12:20.990 --> 01:12:21.490
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, John.

01:12:21.530 --> 01:12:22.731
[SPEAKER_14]: John, you may speak.

01:12:24.372 --> 01:12:29.375
[SPEAKER_27]: While I was there, if some of you remember, I actually stole Loki's library of songs and such.

01:12:30.976 --> 01:12:32.377
[SPEAKER_04]: I vaguely recall, yes.

01:12:33.197 --> 01:12:38.961
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember, didn't you take a tour of Tech TV when you were out here and you were talking about how awesome Tech TV was and then they got sold?

01:12:39.141 --> 01:12:42.823
[SPEAKER_27]: I did, and I was really upset when G4 brought them out.

01:12:42.843 --> 01:12:44.084
[SPEAKER_27]: Rob, get your fucking glasses over here.

01:12:44.625 --> 01:12:45.645
[SPEAKER_27]: Let the caller talk.

01:12:46.046 --> 01:12:51.968
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, Jamie is too busy thinking about drinking to be listening right now, but I am listening to you, John.

01:12:52.008 --> 01:12:54.529
[SPEAKER_04]: Tech TV got sold the next day and you were pissed.

01:12:55.930 --> 01:12:57.671
[SPEAKER_27]: It was more like a year, but yeah.

01:12:58.551 --> 01:13:00.952
[SPEAKER_27]: I was hoping to get a job there, but I guess not.

01:13:01.092 --> 01:13:02.513
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you say get a job with PETA?

01:13:03.129 --> 01:13:04.030
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's G4.

01:13:04.471 --> 01:13:04.691
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.

01:13:05.492 --> 01:13:06.373
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, you know what's really funny?

01:13:06.413 --> 01:13:07.274
[SPEAKER_04]: This brings up a good point.

01:13:07.815 --> 01:13:10.518
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a good segue, because somebody's chatting with me in private message right now.

01:13:10.778 --> 01:13:12.841
[SPEAKER_04]: John, I don't mean to interrupt you, but you'll like this too.

01:13:13.241 --> 01:13:18.247
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, DeepThought42 in our chat room, who I think might be a new listener.

01:13:18.287 --> 01:13:20.510
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't recognize the name, but then again, I'm drunk, so I apologize.

01:13:20.550 --> 01:13:21.030
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't either.

01:13:21.090 --> 01:13:23.093
[SPEAKER_14]: And you're talking, you've got the speaker way too loud.

01:13:25.174 --> 01:13:32.218
[SPEAKER_04]: DeepThought42 was saying that on attack of the show, I guess they're looking for co-hosts right now.

01:13:32.658 --> 01:13:36.580
[SPEAKER_04]: And he sent them an email saying that we should do it.

01:13:38.171 --> 01:13:40.192
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think the rest of you guys should send him an email.

01:13:40.432 --> 01:13:41.913
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, that'd be awesome.

01:13:41.973 --> 01:13:46.435
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to know where to send that email, ask DeepThought42, because he knows.

01:13:47.035 --> 01:13:49.636
[SPEAKER_04]: And send them an email saying that we should host.

01:13:49.976 --> 01:13:56.379
[SPEAKER_04]: Although seriously, what if he sent that email last week and now they're listening tonight and we're all just fucked up out of our minds?

01:13:56.820 --> 01:13:58.500
[SPEAKER_04]: They would totally are in.

01:13:58.620 --> 01:13:59.481
[SPEAKER_14]: No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:14:00.041 --> 01:14:06.204
[SPEAKER_14]: This is our opportunity that we can prove that we fit in in Hollywood because we can perform drunk or on drugs.

01:14:06.772 --> 01:14:08.573
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, I am like... No, we don't do drugs.

01:14:08.593 --> 01:14:09.093
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't do drugs.

01:14:09.273 --> 01:14:10.353
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't do drugs.

01:14:10.533 --> 01:14:11.734
[SPEAKER_14]: Drugs are not cool.

01:14:11.754 --> 01:14:13.815
[SPEAKER_14]: I do Vicodin, but I'm on a prescription for Vicodin.

01:14:13.855 --> 01:14:22.858
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't do drugs because I can't swallow pills and have a phobia with needles, so the drugs are out of the picture, but alcohol is perfectly fine.

01:14:24.038 --> 01:14:24.359
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

01:14:24.699 --> 01:14:25.759
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyway, I'm sorry, John.

01:14:26.279 --> 01:14:27.400
[SPEAKER_04]: Why did you call in anyway?

01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:28.440
[SPEAKER_04]: What's on your mind?

01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:29.981
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, I've got two things.

01:14:30.061 --> 01:14:30.421
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

01:14:30.501 --> 01:14:33.302
[SPEAKER_27]: First, I'd like to reflect on one of my favorite memories.

01:14:33.683 --> 01:14:44.949
[SPEAKER_27]: and that was actually when Karaoke Revolution first came out and Loki was singing, what was it, It's the End of the World and then also I'm Staying In or whatever it was.

01:14:46.229 --> 01:14:48.110
[SPEAKER_04]: That show was awesome.

01:14:48.310 --> 01:14:51.012
[SPEAKER_23]: It was I'm Staying In and it was, what was the other one?

01:14:51.132 --> 01:14:53.513
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to say it was Complicated or something.

01:14:53.573 --> 01:14:54.954
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, Complicated.

01:14:55.694 --> 01:14:58.255
[SPEAKER_23]: There's another one that Nellie was talking about yesterday.

01:14:58.416 --> 01:15:01.177
[SPEAKER_23]: It was, oh God, I don't remember the song.

01:15:03.303 --> 01:15:04.846
[SPEAKER_23]: Never mind, I'm not even going to remember it.

01:15:05.327 --> 01:15:14.627
[SPEAKER_23]: There was another song that she was singing that should be in Karaoke Revolution, and it was funny, but never mind, I can't remember it, so I'm not going to.

01:15:15.151 --> 01:15:19.893
[SPEAKER_04]: That was one of my favorite shows, too, because any time Loki makes an ass out of himself is a good show to me.

01:15:19.913 --> 01:15:23.755
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, you know, Karaoke Revolution Party Edition is going to be coming out in, I think, September.

01:15:23.775 --> 01:15:25.696
[SPEAKER_04]: We are all over that shit, too.

01:15:25.836 --> 01:15:26.757
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, not September.

01:15:26.777 --> 01:15:27.177
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

01:15:27.197 --> 01:15:28.958
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be November.

01:15:30.398 --> 01:15:33.860
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, same day, I think, Ultramix 3 is coming out.

01:15:33.880 --> 01:15:37.502
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be November, I want to say, 23rd or something like that.

01:15:38.733 --> 01:15:43.698
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to be when Karaoke Revolution Party Edition is going to be coming out for all three systems.

01:15:46.481 --> 01:15:47.202
[SPEAKER_04]: That's scary.

01:15:48.723 --> 01:15:54.887
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so I'm trying to find a clip of that episode where he's singing, but I'm so drunk I can't navigate my computer right now.

01:15:55.407 --> 01:15:57.109
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll keep looking on it.

01:15:57.129 --> 01:15:58.069
[SPEAKER_27]: I'll find one on my computer.

01:15:58.089 --> 01:15:58.790
[SPEAKER_27]: I think I got one.

01:15:58.810 --> 01:15:59.510
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be awesome.

01:15:59.530 --> 01:16:02.852
[SPEAKER_04]: Feels like someone shot Novocaine straight into my brain.

01:16:02.872 --> 01:16:06.034
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody had it uploaded somewhere, so we gotta find that somewhere.

01:16:06.875 --> 01:16:13.579
[SPEAKER_04]: I only have... The only Loki sound clip I have is somewhere else.

01:16:13.639 --> 01:16:15.441
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't even... God, this is horrible.

01:16:15.701 --> 01:16:17.482
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, what's your other thing you wanted to call it out, John?

01:16:18.396 --> 01:16:20.298
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, I need to make an announcement, actually.

01:16:21.199 --> 01:16:24.521
[SPEAKER_27]: As you all know, I am a huge Phantasy Star Online whore.

01:16:25.462 --> 01:16:30.907
[SPEAKER_27]: And after all the success that Red vs. Blue has had, I have decided to start my own machinima.

01:16:32.448 --> 01:16:35.411
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're going to do a Phantasy Star version of Red vs. Blue?

01:16:35.431 --> 01:16:38.974
[SPEAKER_14]: You have to play PSO on... Rob, turn the speaker down!

01:16:38.994 --> 01:16:42.798
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, that's the only way I can hear the Skype.

01:16:42.818 --> 01:16:43.698
[SPEAKER_06]: It's down, it's down.

01:16:43.999 --> 01:16:45.480
[SPEAKER_14]: You need to play PSO with me.

01:16:48.109 --> 01:16:48.930
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, now I can hear.

01:16:49.610 --> 01:16:50.130
[SPEAKER_14]: Johnny there?

01:16:50.911 --> 01:16:51.351
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, I am.

01:16:52.372 --> 01:16:58.055
[SPEAKER_27]: Basically, it's really in the early production stages, but I've worked out how I'm going to make the camera work.

01:16:59.396 --> 01:17:07.481
[SPEAKER_27]: And at this point, I'm actually trying to figure out how to get the characters that aren't androids to actually move their mouths.

01:17:08.021 --> 01:17:15.406
[SPEAKER_27]: And I found someone that managed to do that, but he got a little scared after he saw how much work there was.

01:17:16.566 --> 01:17:21.191
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm going to post what he showed me in the chat room as well.

01:17:21.911 --> 01:17:29.980
[SPEAKER_27]: So if anybody wants to sign on and help make this a reality, I'm asking for any help I can get at this point.

01:17:30.080 --> 01:17:31.221
[SPEAKER_04]: John, more power to you.

01:17:31.241 --> 01:17:33.984
[SPEAKER_04]: Red vs. Blue is hilarious and PSO is a great game.

01:17:34.024 --> 01:17:36.887
[SPEAKER_04]: So any luck that you have with this, I think it would be awesome.

01:17:37.748 --> 01:17:42.029
[SPEAKER_04]: Plug away in our chat room and chatters, help John out because this is a good project.

01:17:42.449 --> 01:17:43.089
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely.

01:17:43.229 --> 01:17:48.451
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to participate in this because I think that being the diva I am, I must be involved.

01:17:48.491 --> 01:17:51.452
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, and also, I mean, especially, I mean, look at Red vs. Blue.

01:17:51.492 --> 01:17:54.632
[SPEAKER_23]: They're basically now a spokesperson for like Halo and stuff.

01:17:54.672 --> 01:17:56.093
[SPEAKER_23]: I mean, that's awesome.

01:17:56.313 --> 01:17:58.413
[SPEAKER_04]: John, you could be the Sega spokesperson.

01:17:58.433 --> 01:18:00.554
[SPEAKER_04]: Would that just not make you a happy little fanboy or what?

01:18:01.414 --> 01:18:04.396
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, I applied to be a GM last year, but that didn't work out.

01:18:04.436 --> 01:18:05.036
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh my god.

01:18:05.076 --> 01:18:06.097
[SPEAKER_27]: That's close, I'm gonna get.

01:18:06.337 --> 01:18:06.938
[SPEAKER_27]: You know what?

01:18:07.138 --> 01:18:28.372
[SPEAKER_23]: I actually have a business card, or at least I had a business card, for a guy that was the Halo, or not the Halo, the 1008, so drunk, anyways, no, no, the Sega guy, um, that was the, um, I wanna say the production manager there at Sega, that they, um, I met them at, um, what was it, one of these, um,

01:18:29.403 --> 01:18:29.583
[SPEAKER_23]: and so on.

01:18:50.596 --> 01:18:53.277
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see if I can find that card somewhere.

01:18:53.337 --> 01:18:53.677
[SPEAKER_27]: All right.

01:18:54.018 --> 01:18:58.219
[SPEAKER_27]: And I've actually spoken with one of the GMs already about this project, and he's really interested.

01:18:58.259 --> 01:19:01.741
[SPEAKER_27]: So hopefully I'll get the support of Sega behind me as well on this one.

01:19:01.761 --> 01:19:01.981
[SPEAKER_04]: Good.

01:19:02.141 --> 01:19:02.901
[SPEAKER_04]: John, make it happen.

01:19:02.921 --> 01:19:03.641
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got our support.

01:19:03.661 --> 01:19:05.702
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll plug it on the podcast or something.

01:19:06.242 --> 01:19:06.522
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

01:19:06.843 --> 01:19:07.403
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, thank you.

01:19:07.423 --> 01:19:08.183
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a good one, John.

01:19:08.203 --> 01:19:09.023
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for calling in.

01:19:09.564 --> 01:19:11.404
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, and once again, happy third anniversary.

01:19:11.524 --> 01:19:13.625
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, and thanks for supporting us over the past couple years.

01:19:13.645 --> 01:19:14.226
[SPEAKER_04]: We appreciate it.

01:19:14.966 --> 01:19:15.206
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay.

01:19:15.386 --> 01:19:16.066
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a super day.

01:19:16.867 --> 01:19:17.407
[SPEAKER_27]: All right, you too.

01:19:17.427 --> 01:19:17.527
[SPEAKER_27]: Later.

01:19:17.547 --> 01:19:17.807
[SPEAKER_04]: Later.

01:19:18.669 --> 01:19:21.250
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on, I have that Loki sound clip, you guys.

01:19:21.650 --> 01:19:22.710
[SPEAKER_04]: God damn!

01:19:23.690 --> 01:19:24.631
[SPEAKER_04]: Ow, my foot!

01:19:24.671 --> 01:19:27.231
[SPEAKER_16]: Why did I shoot myself in my foot?

01:19:27.611 --> 01:19:29.392
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god, it hurts so bad!

01:19:29.792 --> 01:19:31.112
[SPEAKER_23]: I need that for walking!

01:19:32.493 --> 01:19:33.553
[SPEAKER_07]: No, my foot!

01:19:33.593 --> 01:19:34.773
[SPEAKER_07]: I need that for walking!

01:19:36.834 --> 01:19:43.736
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to point out, somebody named Bomanikay just joined our chatroom, and I'm thinking, if you gave your computer to your sister,

01:19:45.427 --> 01:19:46.928
[SPEAKER_23]: She's not joining the chatroom.

01:19:46.948 --> 01:19:47.728
[SPEAKER_23]: She doesn't even know.

01:19:47.928 --> 01:19:48.949
[SPEAKER_23]: She's on dial-up.

01:19:48.989 --> 01:19:49.569
[SPEAKER_23]: Come on now.

01:19:49.769 --> 01:19:53.831
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody named Bomanikay just joined the chatroom and says, Hi, Loki, we love you.

01:19:56.192 --> 01:19:57.232
[SPEAKER_24]: It's not her.

01:19:57.272 --> 01:19:57.772
[SPEAKER_24]: Trust me.

01:19:59.793 --> 01:20:01.734
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I said, is that Loki's sister?

01:20:01.774 --> 01:20:03.775
[SPEAKER_04]: And they said, yup, and family is listening.

01:20:04.776 --> 01:20:05.616
[SPEAKER_23]: She is not.

01:20:06.496 --> 01:20:07.377
[SPEAKER_23]: It is not her.

01:20:07.477 --> 01:20:08.057
[SPEAKER_23]: Trust me.

01:20:08.777 --> 01:20:11.999
[SPEAKER_23]: My family, first off, no, it's not even her.

01:20:12.019 --> 01:20:12.339
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay.

01:20:13.757 --> 01:20:16.139
[SPEAKER_04]: You are so screwed if that person's telling the truth.

01:20:16.239 --> 01:20:17.079
[SPEAKER_23]: It is not her!

01:20:17.680 --> 01:20:19.020
[SPEAKER_04]: They're telling me yes they do.

01:20:19.761 --> 01:20:21.082
[SPEAKER_23]: No, it's not my sister.

01:20:21.162 --> 01:20:24.784
[SPEAKER_23]: First off, okay, first off, she's on dial-up, okay?

01:20:25.124 --> 01:20:27.586
[SPEAKER_04]: That's for one.

01:20:27.826 --> 01:20:31.909
[SPEAKER_23]: And second, okay, she doesn't know how to use damn IRC anyway.

01:20:32.109 --> 01:20:32.929
[SPEAKER_04]: What if she learned?

01:20:33.510 --> 01:20:35.531
[SPEAKER_04]: She doesn't know how to use the internet?

01:20:35.611 --> 01:20:36.432
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on now!

01:20:37.372 --> 01:20:40.155
[SPEAKER_04]: She uses Juno to connect to the goddamn internet.

01:20:40.815 --> 01:20:44.998
[SPEAKER_04]: But Monty Cade, you've got to say something that only Loki would know.

01:20:45.199 --> 01:20:48.661
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I'm going to pee my pants laughing.

01:20:48.802 --> 01:20:49.562
[SPEAKER_04]: I will say it on air.

01:20:49.582 --> 01:20:52.184
[SPEAKER_04]: I am so drunk, I can't even see the chatroom.

01:20:52.284 --> 01:20:54.146
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like a bunch of blurr.

01:20:54.906 --> 01:20:59.350
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to finish my drink and get another one.

01:20:59.650 --> 01:21:02.312
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not listening to me right now.

01:21:02.352 --> 01:21:04.354
[SPEAKER_04]: They have better things to be... They've been watching like...

01:21:04.634 --> 01:21:06.174
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's a movie or something.

01:21:06.214 --> 01:21:08.135
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not listening to my goddamn show.

01:21:09.715 --> 01:21:10.815
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't even... Okay.

01:21:12.096 --> 01:21:13.276
[SPEAKER_04]: Where is the money?

01:21:13.356 --> 01:21:14.056
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, go sit down.

01:21:14.836 --> 01:21:17.717
[SPEAKER_04]: Mom, G-Ma, G-Pa, and Sis listening.

01:21:22.358 --> 01:21:22.638
Oh, God.

01:21:22.978 --> 01:21:23.718
I'm gonna cry.

01:21:24.138 --> 01:21:24.738
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, you know what?

01:21:24.758 --> 01:21:30.299
[SPEAKER_23]: That could be them because my grandma and grandpa are at my mom's house.

01:21:30.359 --> 01:21:31.780
[SPEAKER_16]: You are so screwy.

01:21:36.479 --> 01:21:38.819
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, if that's the case... Hello, family!

01:21:39.239 --> 01:21:41.960
[SPEAKER_23]: I am drinking right now, and I am... But he's being responsible.

01:21:41.980 --> 01:21:43.201
[SPEAKER_23]: He has a designated driver here.

01:21:43.221 --> 01:21:47.302
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a designated driver, and I am... And this is all a rating stunt.

01:21:47.362 --> 01:21:48.342
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, DarkSakura, get this.

01:21:48.382 --> 01:21:50.163
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki's family is listening right now.

01:21:51.103 --> 01:21:52.284
[SPEAKER_14]: Designated driver three.

01:21:54.392 --> 01:21:54.652
[SPEAKER_04]: Ran-chan!

01:21:54.672 --> 01:21:55.392
[SPEAKER_04]: Ran-chan!

01:21:55.492 --> 01:21:56.013
[SPEAKER_14]: Ran-chan!

01:21:56.053 --> 01:21:56.313
[SPEAKER_04]: Ran-chan!

01:22:23.652 --> 01:22:25.594
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, Rook-chan, what is it?

01:22:28.556 --> 01:22:30.138
[SPEAKER_10]: You are, you are tore up, aren't you?

01:22:30.298 --> 01:22:30.558
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

01:22:31.639 --> 01:22:31.939
[SPEAKER_02]: Liar.

01:22:39.245 --> 01:22:40.426
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like so full.

01:22:40.547 --> 01:22:47.332
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like I am full of food because I just ate like, you know, two meals and I've had about three or four drinks right now.

01:22:47.713 --> 01:22:48.734
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, no, four drinks.

01:22:49.614 --> 01:22:50.095
[SPEAKER_14]: I think.

01:22:52.388 --> 01:23:03.941
[SPEAKER_04]: Hachi no nomimasu Wait, wait, wait, Loki Tudor train is the one you use to push in your power suit Oh my god

01:23:12.702 --> 01:23:20.447
[SPEAKER_14]: I have no idea why liquor is making me speak in Japanese.

01:23:20.527 --> 01:23:21.248
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to go get more.

01:23:23.109 --> 01:23:23.889
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god.

01:23:23.969 --> 01:23:24.570
[SPEAKER_04]: It's on your mind.

01:23:25.748 --> 01:23:28.850
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, I just wanted to talk about the upcoming DOA movie real quick.

01:23:29.451 --> 01:23:30.132
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm sorry.

01:23:30.172 --> 01:23:31.933
[SPEAKER_02]: When are you going to come cosplay with me?

01:23:32.914 --> 01:23:35.055
[SPEAKER_10]: As soon as I get enough money to come out there.

01:23:35.836 --> 01:23:36.537
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, okay.

01:23:36.597 --> 01:23:38.498
[SPEAKER_04]: Let Ranma talk about the Dead or Alive movie.

01:23:38.518 --> 01:23:38.838
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up?

01:23:38.858 --> 01:23:41.921
[SPEAKER_14]: You need to cosplay Manji for me so I can cosplay Rin.

01:23:43.122 --> 01:23:44.283
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll think about it, okay?

01:23:46.224 --> 01:23:49.427
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, um... Okay, on the podcast... Hold on, hold on.

01:23:49.707 --> 01:23:53.110
[SPEAKER_04]: I can hear Loki ran outside to go tell... To go...

01:23:54.631 --> 01:24:02.535
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki walked outside to tell Nelly something in the living room because Nelly's the designated driver tonight and I can hear Nelly laughing all the way back here.

01:24:03.876 --> 01:24:05.977
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to go get more liquor and I'll be right back.

01:24:06.017 --> 01:24:06.697
[SPEAKER_04]: Ranma, what's on your mind?

01:24:07.458 --> 01:24:07.818
[SPEAKER_02]: Not much.

01:24:08.158 --> 01:24:10.099
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to talk about the DOA movie.

01:24:10.139 --> 01:24:10.980
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, the DOA movie.

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:11.320
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up?

01:24:12.020 --> 01:24:15.222
[SPEAKER_02]: The guy that's playing Ryu Hayabusa, Ken Kosugi.

01:24:16.002 --> 01:24:17.563
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know who his father is?

01:24:19.604 --> 01:24:20.164
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, what?

01:24:20.184 --> 01:24:22.466
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know who his father is?

01:24:22.566 --> 01:24:22.886
[SPEAKER_02]: No, who?

01:24:24.139 --> 01:24:30.421
[SPEAKER_02]: Sho Kasugi, he did all those ninja movies from the 80s, and he also helped put together Tenchu.

01:24:31.921 --> 01:24:33.902
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, you cut out there, he also helped put together what?

01:24:34.622 --> 01:24:37.883
[SPEAKER_02]: He did the choreography for Tenchu, Stealth Assassins.

01:24:38.383 --> 01:24:38.723
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

01:24:39.803 --> 01:24:45.785
[SPEAKER_02]: I just posted a link about that, so, this guy plays on everything, so you know what?

01:24:46.765 --> 01:24:49.146
[SPEAKER_02]: They got the perfect person to play Ryu, that's all.

01:24:51.310 --> 01:24:52.371
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds awesome to me.

01:24:52.771 --> 01:24:56.214
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking forward to the Dead or Alive movie, even though I'm not a huge fan of the games.

01:24:56.634 --> 01:25:00.817
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm really hoping they don't screw one of those movies up.

01:25:01.758 --> 01:25:02.278
[SPEAKER_02]: Same here.

01:25:02.518 --> 01:25:07.842
[SPEAKER_02]: Last I heard about the movie, which was back in 2000-2001, William Shatner was supposed to be a part of it.

01:25:07.922 --> 01:25:08.702
[SPEAKER_04]: Heck no.

01:25:08.822 --> 01:25:09.543
[SPEAKER_04]: Heck no.

01:25:09.843 --> 01:25:10.824
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad that didn't happen.

01:25:11.744 --> 01:25:12.605
[SPEAKER_04]: You ain't the only one.

01:25:13.706 --> 01:25:14.126
[SPEAKER_04]: Right on.

01:25:14.166 --> 01:25:15.227
[SPEAKER_04]: What else is on your mind, Ranma?

01:25:16.327 --> 01:25:16.887
[SPEAKER_02]: Not much.

01:25:17.108 --> 01:25:19.169
[SPEAKER_02]: I just went to a convention a couple of weeks back.

01:25:19.189 --> 01:25:23.070
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we had fun, got drunk, orgy, you know, the normal chaos.

01:25:23.190 --> 01:25:23.591
[SPEAKER_04]: Hot!

01:25:27.633 --> 01:25:28.793
[SPEAKER_04]: We have Matt's parents listening.

01:25:28.893 --> 01:25:31.654
[SPEAKER_04]: Please don't say those types of things on air.

01:25:31.694 --> 01:25:32.255
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not good.

01:25:33.075 --> 01:25:33.575
[SPEAKER_02]: Like orgy?

01:25:33.996 --> 01:25:34.896
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, don't say that word.

01:25:34.976 --> 01:25:35.636
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a dirty word.

01:25:36.477 --> 01:25:37.497
[SPEAKER_04]: So I can't say orgy anymore?

01:25:37.537 --> 01:25:38.077
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you can't.

01:25:38.498 --> 01:25:39.158
[SPEAKER_04]: It's banned tonight.

01:25:41.997 --> 01:25:43.579
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if Loki's going to come back on air.

01:25:43.619 --> 01:25:44.760
[SPEAKER_04]: I think he's too embarrassed.

01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:46.101
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, here he comes.

01:25:46.401 --> 01:25:49.744
[SPEAKER_14]: They are actually listening.

01:25:49.764 --> 01:25:50.624
[SPEAKER_14]: My purse is ringing.

01:25:50.804 --> 01:25:53.567
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, they wanted to know where you went.

01:25:56.129 --> 01:25:58.431
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they are actually listening to this show.

01:25:58.691 --> 01:25:59.712
[SPEAKER_08]: They're all laughing at us.

01:26:00.412 --> 01:26:01.213
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on, what, Nellie?

01:26:02.068 --> 01:26:06.989
[SPEAKER_08]: I said I have Matt's sister on the phone and his whole family is laughing at him right now.

01:26:07.369 --> 01:26:11.790
[SPEAKER_04]: Just think of this as a rite of passage.

01:26:11.850 --> 01:26:14.571
[SPEAKER_04]: This is something that every young man must go through.

01:26:16.351 --> 01:26:19.131
[SPEAKER_04]: When your mom finds out that you're a drunk on the internet.

01:26:21.012 --> 01:26:23.812
[SPEAKER_02]: I want a copy of this show.

01:26:23.852 --> 01:26:24.933
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll figure something out.

01:26:25.653 --> 01:26:26.233
[SPEAKER_04]: Please do that.

01:26:28.450 --> 01:26:29.850
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, Ranma, anything else on your mind?

01:26:29.870 --> 01:26:31.331
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we've got to go and make fun of Loki.

01:26:31.911 --> 01:26:32.191
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

01:26:32.971 --> 01:26:34.712
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a couple of drinks for me, okay?

01:26:34.792 --> 01:26:35.172
[SPEAKER_02]: Will do.

01:26:35.852 --> 01:26:36.532
[SPEAKER_02]: Have one for me.

01:26:36.652 --> 01:26:40.673
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm on number nine, and I've got to go to the potty so bad.

01:26:40.713 --> 01:26:41.674
[SPEAKER_04]: Give us a drink count.

01:26:42.554 --> 01:26:45.015
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm on nine, Loki's on, he's got a full glass.

01:26:45.035 --> 01:26:45.715
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even know.

01:26:45.735 --> 01:26:46.615
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that seven and eight?

01:26:46.915 --> 01:26:48.796
[SPEAKER_23]: I think that's like nine and ten.

01:26:49.036 --> 01:26:50.836
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got another double shot, whatever that is.

01:26:50.996 --> 01:26:54.177
[SPEAKER_04]: And DarkSakura, what drink number are you on, for those keeping count at home?

01:26:55.137 --> 01:26:55.478
[SPEAKER_04]: Six.

01:26:55.718 --> 01:26:56.738
[SPEAKER_04]: She's putting up six fingers.

01:26:57.885 --> 01:27:00.187
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't believe that my family is listening to this.

01:27:00.207 --> 01:27:01.388
[SPEAKER_04]: This is crazy.

01:27:01.568 --> 01:27:06.911
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, the six is counting actual number of drinks, not counting shots.

01:27:08.553 --> 01:27:10.054
[SPEAKER_04]: Why are people listening to me?

01:27:10.134 --> 01:27:11.475
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's so crazy.

01:27:11.635 --> 01:27:12.535
[SPEAKER_04]: Ranma, we gotta go.

01:27:12.555 --> 01:27:13.676
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you are fucking hilarious.

01:27:13.716 --> 01:27:14.437
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I am.

01:27:14.457 --> 01:27:15.077
[SPEAKER_04]: Take care, my friend.

01:27:15.698 --> 01:27:16.038
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye-bye.

01:27:16.078 --> 01:27:16.378
[SPEAKER_14]: Bye.

01:27:18.019 --> 01:27:19.180
[SPEAKER_14]: No, no, Ranchan can't go.

01:27:19.200 --> 01:27:20.181
[SPEAKER_06]: I already hung up on him.

01:27:20.201 --> 01:27:20.541
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

01:27:20.661 --> 01:27:21.882
[SPEAKER_14]: Ranchan has to come back.

01:27:22.943 --> 01:27:23.763
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, what do you want to tell him?

01:27:23.783 --> 01:27:24.224
[SPEAKER_06]: He's listening.

01:27:25.825 --> 01:27:26.085
[SPEAKER_14]: Nothing.

01:27:27.116 --> 01:27:30.100
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright, so about those, you know, dancing games.

01:27:31.422 --> 01:27:33.305
[SPEAKER_14]: Ah, who fucking plays those anymore?

01:27:36.547 --> 01:27:48.397
[SPEAKER_14]: I have to go over to my mom's house tomorrow to actually do Fourth of July stuff.

01:27:48.597 --> 01:27:53.841
[SPEAKER_04]: We're actually outstanding citizens of the community and we do charity work and all that, don't we?

01:27:54.342 --> 01:27:54.682
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

01:27:55.262 --> 01:27:55.983
[SPEAKER_04]: I did charity work.

01:27:56.003 --> 01:27:57.504
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, you can turn the speaker down now.

01:27:57.644 --> 01:27:58.145
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, sorry.

01:27:58.305 --> 01:28:03.549
[SPEAKER_04]: All I got to say right now is for some reason my hand is numb and I don't know why that is.

01:28:03.629 --> 01:28:04.650
[SPEAKER_04]: My lips are numb.

01:28:05.365 --> 01:28:08.466
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have a full drink here, so I've got to finish that.

01:28:09.866 --> 01:28:10.286
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

01:28:11.166 --> 01:28:13.767
[SPEAKER_14]: I mixed Loki a super yummy drink.

01:28:13.807 --> 01:28:15.987
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank God I have a designated driver.

01:28:16.287 --> 01:28:20.248
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, again, boys and girls, if you are going to drink, have a designated driver.

01:28:20.608 --> 01:28:22.029
[SPEAKER_04]: We were model citizens.

01:28:22.049 --> 01:28:28.050
[SPEAKER_14]: No, no, no, no, you were wrong, DTE, because I have had six actual drinks.

01:28:29.258 --> 01:28:35.460
[SPEAKER_14]: I've had one, two beers, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

01:28:36.101 --> 01:28:38.542
[SPEAKER_14]: I have had ten shots, including my beers.

01:28:39.382 --> 01:28:39.982
[SPEAKER_04]: That's great.

01:28:40.062 --> 01:28:41.963
[SPEAKER_04]: I get to go face my family tomorrow.

01:28:42.143 --> 01:28:42.583
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.

01:28:42.643 --> 01:28:43.203
[SPEAKER_04]: So fix it!

01:28:46.520 --> 01:28:48.562
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for watching!

01:29:06.514 --> 01:29:07.735
[SPEAKER_23]: All right, here you go.

01:29:08.816 --> 01:29:09.177
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, man.

01:29:09.217 --> 01:29:11.099
[SPEAKER_14]: Now that you're not spilling it all over the damn kitchen.

01:29:11.219 --> 01:29:13.401
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm not spilling anything, okay?

01:29:13.761 --> 01:29:14.462
[SPEAKER_14]: It's actually pretty good.

01:29:14.502 --> 01:29:17.085
[SPEAKER_14]: You did, too, freaking spill it all over the damn kitchen.

01:29:17.105 --> 01:29:24.532
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, but... Because poor Exifer was down there with a towel on his hands and knees scrubbing up after your freaking...

01:29:25.393 --> 01:29:29.155
[SPEAKER_04]: SloshyLickerAss Listen, I brought the towel with me, okay?

01:29:29.175 --> 01:29:30.316
[SPEAKER_04]: I brought the paper towel with me.

01:29:30.336 --> 01:29:31.776
[SPEAKER_04]: You brought one with you.

01:29:31.836 --> 01:29:32.517
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, okay, okay.

01:29:32.557 --> 01:29:32.917
[SPEAKER_14]: No, no, no.

01:29:32.977 --> 01:29:34.037
[SPEAKER_14]: Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck that.

01:29:34.878 --> 01:29:37.959
[SPEAKER_14]: You had the towel with you in here.

01:29:38.300 --> 01:29:40.901
[SPEAKER_14]: You were spilling freaking orange juice all over the goddamn floor.

01:29:41.221 --> 01:29:48.525
[SPEAKER_14]: And if orange juice left unchecked, it tends to mutate and collect dust buddies, which turn into a huge fucking mess.

01:29:49.385 --> 01:29:50.566
[SPEAKER_23]: Okie dokie.

01:29:51.186 --> 01:29:52.387
[SPEAKER_14]: So you, sir...

01:29:53.479 --> 01:29:59.447
[SPEAKER_14]: Build the orange juice on the floor And it's not for the valiant Can we move on?

01:30:00.329 --> 01:30:07.519
[SPEAKER_14]: I am not done It's not for the valiant efforts of your roommate, Rob Extifer

01:30:07.918 --> 01:30:08.118
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

01:30:08.739 --> 01:30:13.383
[SPEAKER_14]: There would be, you would be stepping in quagmire every time you entered the kitchen.

01:30:14.443 --> 01:30:16.525
[SPEAKER_14]: Something along the lines of my ex-partner.

01:30:17.446 --> 01:30:17.986
[SPEAKER_24]: Quagmire.

01:30:18.267 --> 01:30:23.511
[SPEAKER_13]: Can we, can we please... Hey, we should go... Ride green pong!

01:30:23.531 --> 01:30:26.133
[SPEAKER_04]: Your sister says, have fun, Orange Lounge.

01:30:26.273 --> 01:30:26.894
[SPEAKER_04]: Be safe.

01:30:27.174 --> 01:30:28.175
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye, your family.

01:30:28.275 --> 01:30:29.055
[SPEAKER_04]: See you on the 4th.

01:30:31.137 --> 01:30:33.019
[SPEAKER_04]: Why are they listening to this show?

01:30:34.144 --> 01:30:35.346
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at it this way.

01:30:35.426 --> 01:30:36.327
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at it this way.

01:30:36.347 --> 01:30:37.309
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki's family out there listening.

01:30:47.881 --> 01:30:51.184
[SPEAKER_04]: There are many, many worse things that Loki could be doing right now.

01:30:51.244 --> 01:30:52.344
[SPEAKER_04]: He doesn't do drugs.

01:30:52.625 --> 01:30:55.007
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a drug-free American citizen.

01:30:55.067 --> 01:30:57.168
[SPEAKER_04]: I only drink on pretty weekends.

01:30:57.188 --> 01:30:59.730
[SPEAKER_04]: He provides a service to the youth of America.

01:31:00.371 --> 01:31:02.172
[SPEAKER_04]: He teaches them to stay in school.

01:31:03.553 --> 01:31:03.953
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

01:31:04.494 --> 01:31:06.455
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, if they don't want to end up like me.

01:31:08.837 --> 01:31:09.177
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

01:31:10.714 --> 01:31:12.715
[SPEAKER_04]: I've really got to go to the bathroom.

01:31:12.755 --> 01:31:13.955
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to go to a cage match.

01:31:14.095 --> 01:31:16.456
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, we're going to go to a cage match and then we'll come back and we'll take more time.

01:31:16.716 --> 01:31:20.657
[SPEAKER_14]: I won last week's win, win, win, win, win, win.

01:31:20.877 --> 01:31:22.277
[SPEAKER_14]: Win, win, win, win.

01:31:22.598 --> 01:31:23.598
[SPEAKER_04]: We're getting one more call.

01:31:23.858 --> 01:31:26.139
[SPEAKER_04]: This is from a new listener, so we'll go ahead and take this call.

01:31:26.699 --> 01:31:28.699
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we like it when new people call in.

01:31:28.719 --> 01:31:30.880
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:31:32.080 --> 01:31:32.540
Hey, what's up?

01:31:32.560 --> 01:31:33.401
This is DeepThought42.

01:31:33.521 --> 01:31:36.301
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh, you're very, very quiet on there, DeepThought42.

01:31:36.361 --> 01:31:38.282
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there any way you can talk into your microphone a little more?

01:31:39.419 --> 01:31:39.779
[SPEAKER_25]: Hold on.

01:31:40.120 --> 01:31:40.340
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

01:31:41.441 --> 01:31:42.701
[SPEAKER_25]: What should I hold on to?

01:31:42.721 --> 01:31:43.602
[SPEAKER_04]: A little, little bit.

01:31:43.702 --> 01:31:44.182
[SPEAKER_04]: Talk again.

01:31:45.503 --> 01:31:46.164
[SPEAKER_25]: Hold on one second.

01:31:46.464 --> 01:31:46.684
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

01:31:47.264 --> 01:31:48.745
[SPEAKER_04]: He's very, very quiet, boys and girls.

01:31:48.765 --> 01:31:49.286
[SPEAKER_04]: We're sorry.

01:31:50.046 --> 01:31:51.987
[SPEAKER_14]: It's always the quiet ones you gotta watch out for.

01:31:52.027 --> 01:31:54.569
[SPEAKER_04]: We can barely hear you, my friend.

01:31:57.611 --> 01:31:57.951
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello?

01:31:57.971 --> 01:32:03.755
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you might have turned off the... No, just give him a moment to adjust.

01:32:05.036 --> 01:32:06.617
[SPEAKER_04]: See, I can hear you just as loud as I can hear him.

01:32:08.394 --> 01:32:08.834
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's right.

01:32:09.654 --> 01:32:13.115
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll give you a tip in the chat room, and then why don't you call us back after the cage match, alright?

01:32:13.455 --> 01:32:14.175
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, thanks.

01:32:14.335 --> 01:32:14.995
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, later.

01:32:15.236 --> 01:32:15.576
[SPEAKER_04]: Later.

01:32:16.476 --> 01:32:17.556
[SPEAKER_04]: I can hear myself on there.

01:32:17.576 --> 01:32:18.216
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of weird.

01:32:18.356 --> 01:32:19.076
[SPEAKER_04]: He's very quiet.

01:32:19.096 --> 01:32:20.537
[SPEAKER_06]: He's got a very low delay.

01:32:20.557 --> 01:32:21.857
[SPEAKER_06]: Turn the microphone down.

01:32:21.877 --> 01:32:22.697
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, I'm trying to get down.

01:32:22.837 --> 01:32:23.777
[SPEAKER_06]: You're giving me a freaking headache.

01:32:23.797 --> 01:32:24.218
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

01:32:24.258 --> 01:32:26.638
[SPEAKER_14]: He's got a very small delay, though.

01:32:26.658 --> 01:32:29.419
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, he must have a fast... He has to be near to us.

01:32:29.479 --> 01:32:33.199
[SPEAKER_04]: He must have a fast internet connection, so... Everything's spinning.

01:32:33.260 --> 01:32:35.220
[SPEAKER_04]: That's... fun.

01:32:36.292 --> 01:32:36.752
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what?

01:32:36.772 --> 01:32:37.592
[SPEAKER_14]: You're fucked up.

01:32:37.752 --> 01:32:39.493
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm, like, not even half there.

01:32:40.093 --> 01:32:40.553
[SPEAKER_14]: So, whatever.

01:32:40.573 --> 01:32:41.213
[SPEAKER_23]: No, that's okay.

01:32:41.594 --> 01:32:42.954
[SPEAKER_23]: I still have to finish my drink.

01:32:42.994 --> 01:32:47.995
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I need to save room in my liquor tolerance for the club tonight, so I can get my hoe on.

01:32:48.035 --> 01:32:56.818
[SPEAKER_23]: I think this is the most drunk-ness I've been, you know, because honestly, when I was at my San Diego... I'm already sobering up, so it doesn't even matter.

01:32:56.838 --> 01:33:04.260
[SPEAKER_04]: When I was at my San Diego event, you know, I thought I was pretty drunk, but this is pretty bad, because, I mean, like, I actually feel like I'm gonna, like, fall over and just

01:33:07.255 --> 01:33:12.917
[SPEAKER_04]: We really need to go to a cage match, kids, because I've got to pee, or I'm going to pee my pants right here in the studio, and you don't want that.

01:33:12.937 --> 01:33:15.038
[SPEAKER_04]: I brought my, um, zip drive here.

01:33:15.078 --> 01:33:16.659
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go, let's stop tonight's cage match.

01:33:17.999 --> 01:33:18.759
[SPEAKER_04]: There it is.

01:33:18.819 --> 01:33:19.280
[SPEAKER_04]: I love Kotaku!

01:33:23.855 --> 01:33:24.355
[SPEAKER_04]: Alex!

01:33:24.415 --> 01:33:29.077
[SPEAKER_04]: The way the case works, three songs we're going to play for you guys.

01:33:29.297 --> 01:33:30.338
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to play for you guys.

01:33:30.358 --> 01:33:39.562
[SPEAKER_04]: You get to vote for your favorite, and the winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio Live's Milani Music and More program, which plays 24 hours a day, 70 days a week.

01:33:39.782 --> 01:33:41.803
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically, we're going to play three songs to vote for your favorite.

01:33:41.863 --> 01:33:43.624
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how it works.

01:33:43.704 --> 01:33:44.684
[SPEAKER_04]: It's totally you guys.

01:33:44.704 --> 01:33:45.444
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys get control.

01:33:45.504 --> 01:33:46.945
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know we have new listeners tonight.

01:33:47.165 --> 01:33:48.806
[SPEAKER_04]: Only votes for Loki count.

01:33:49.626 --> 01:33:50.847
[SPEAKER_04]: No, shh, don't tell them that.

01:33:50.927 --> 01:33:57.491
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so you only get to hear a clip of the song that won from last week, because you already heard it last week.

01:33:57.591 --> 01:34:03.714
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though I know we have new listeners tonight, thanks to the great Apple, we're only playing a clip.

01:34:04.074 --> 01:34:05.175
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm so gone.

01:34:05.215 --> 01:34:08.337
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, you are so freaking drunk right now, it's not even funny.

01:34:09.237 --> 01:34:13.480
[SPEAKER_14]: Ah, no, no, no, no, no, he's not, I have to make him the mother of all drinks.

01:34:13.920 --> 01:34:18.004
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember, you cannot vote until all three songs have played in their entirety.

01:34:18.024 --> 01:34:21.066
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel sorry for Christopher's desk, because it's probably getting messed up for me.

01:34:21.247 --> 01:34:22.267
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.

01:34:22.508 --> 01:34:24.950
[SPEAKER_04]: Song number one, it's last week's winner.

01:34:25.130 --> 01:34:27.992
[SPEAKER_04]: Or two weeks ago, really, because we didn't have a show last week.

01:34:28.032 --> 01:34:31.956
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura picked Del the Funky Homo Sapien with Dr. Bombay.

01:34:32.336 --> 01:34:33.898
[SPEAKER_04]: That's because that song's fucking awesome.

01:34:33.918 --> 01:34:34.919
[SPEAKER_04]: So see if you like it.

01:34:34.959 --> 01:34:35.679
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the clip.

01:34:35.779 --> 01:34:37.180
[SPEAKER_04]: Song number one you can vote for tonight.

01:34:37.241 --> 01:34:39.823
[SPEAKER_04]: Del the Funky Homo Sapien, Dr. Bombay.

01:36:57.657 --> 01:37:05.361
[SPEAKER_15]: And get up off your knees, everything that Dr. Bombay says It's guaranteed to make you say, so who's the side to hit?

01:37:05.441 --> 01:37:26.490
[SPEAKER_15]: I like little men hanging out with the damn thing Girl, if you ain't got a turn, I won't hesitate to pull out my funky ones But if you ain't down for jump on, cancel your appointment and please get the hell on Cause I won't have fun with fools under my nose if you want 80 feet to close Get out my way so I can save the day, cause I'm Dr. Bombay

01:38:05.467 --> 01:38:07.651
[SPEAKER_04]: Yo, that was song number one.

01:38:07.691 --> 01:38:09.053
[SPEAKER_04]: Song number one tonight's cage match.

01:38:09.373 --> 01:38:10.155
[SPEAKER_04]: Dell the Funky.

01:38:12.659 --> 01:38:13.860
[SPEAKER_04]: We're talking about Del!

01:38:14.080 --> 01:38:16.662
[SPEAKER_04]: Del the Funky Homo Sapien with Dr. Bombay.

01:38:16.942 --> 01:38:18.223
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob is done with his pee.

01:38:18.403 --> 01:38:19.984
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to take the biggest pee, you guys.

01:38:20.564 --> 01:38:21.685
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even know if I flushed.

01:38:21.725 --> 01:38:22.365
[SPEAKER_04]: I was so drunk.

01:38:22.405 --> 01:38:22.806
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I did.

01:38:22.926 --> 01:38:23.526
[SPEAKER_04]: I did, kids.

01:38:23.586 --> 01:38:24.146
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sanitary.

01:38:24.607 --> 01:38:24.907
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

01:38:26.308 --> 01:38:29.330
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's Del the Funky Homo Sapien with Dr. Bombay.

01:38:29.430 --> 01:38:30.471
[SPEAKER_04]: So see if you like that one.

01:38:30.491 --> 01:38:31.271
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's song number two.

01:38:31.351 --> 01:38:33.112
[SPEAKER_04]: Song number two tonight is my pick.

01:38:33.593 --> 01:38:35.674
[SPEAKER_04]: And you might remember last week we announced

01:38:35.774 --> 01:38:36.114
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you Elijah?

01:39:01.283 --> 01:39:04.346
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so precious!

01:39:04.786 --> 01:39:08.329
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so I wanted to play an azoic song for you guys, because it's kind of gothy.

01:39:08.489 --> 01:39:08.969
[SPEAKER_04]: I like it.

01:39:09.250 --> 01:39:09.930
[SPEAKER_04]: I like this band.

01:39:10.050 --> 01:39:10.931
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so too gothy.

01:39:11.151 --> 01:39:12.892
[SPEAKER_04]: It's gothy, and we're going to the gothy club tonight.

01:39:13.053 --> 01:39:14.093
[SPEAKER_04]: I gotta find something to wear, though.

01:39:14.474 --> 01:39:15.134
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyway, here it is.

01:39:16.035 --> 01:39:16.515
[SPEAKER_04]: Should I wear this?

01:39:16.535 --> 01:39:17.997
[SPEAKER_13]: I am as real as this!

01:39:18.537 --> 01:39:19.598
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright, here we go.

01:39:19.698 --> 01:39:20.979
[SPEAKER_13]: It's so sorrow!

01:39:21.059 --> 01:39:24.022
[SPEAKER_22]: Song number two tonight, the azoic, Let Me Tell You Something.

01:39:24.062 --> 01:39:24.282
[SPEAKER_22]: Enjoy.

01:39:57.760 --> 01:39:59.181
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks for watching!

01:40:43.888 --> 01:40:45.929
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft,

[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for watching!

01:42:41.923 --> 01:42:42.984
Thank you for watching.

01:42:43.124 --> 01:42:43.824
See you next time.

01:43:10.200 --> 01:43:14.986
Come get to me Let me tell you something That won't be pushed around

01:44:11.846 --> 01:44:14.527
[SPEAKER_04]: Song number two, The Ezoic, Let Me Tell You Something.

01:44:14.927 --> 01:44:18.809
[SPEAKER_04]: And let me tell you, I don't know if these two heard much of that song, but they'll give it a rating anyway.

01:44:18.849 --> 01:44:19.729
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.

01:44:21.510 --> 01:44:23.671
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the same fucking stuff you always pick.

01:44:24.631 --> 01:44:25.852
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't, I think you're wrong.

01:44:25.952 --> 01:44:26.612
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's different.

01:44:26.692 --> 01:44:32.695
[SPEAKER_14]: Tindy voice, tindy voice and trance, over generic beat, trance.

01:44:32.755 --> 01:44:35.636
[SPEAKER_04]: I think if you put that side by side with my previous picks, the song's very different.

01:44:35.996 --> 01:44:37.357
[SPEAKER_14]: It's actually okay and I give it a seven.

01:44:38.257 --> 01:44:40.098
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, she just wanted to make fun of me.

01:44:40.758 --> 01:44:43.674
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll give it a 9 because

01:44:44.961 --> 01:44:49.164
[SPEAKER_07]: I wasn't here to listen to it, but it sounds great.

01:44:49.684 --> 01:44:51.446
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the drunkest I've ever seen Loki.

01:44:51.906 --> 01:44:52.907
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm gonna make him drunk.

01:44:52.987 --> 01:44:55.128
[SPEAKER_04]: I could have played Britney Spears and that would have gotten a 9.

01:44:55.428 --> 01:44:57.410
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't even know what the hell you played.

01:44:57.770 --> 01:44:59.171
[SPEAKER_04]: It's gonna get a 9, though.

01:44:59.251 --> 01:45:00.932
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the Azoic, let me tell you something.

01:45:01.153 --> 01:45:01.913
[SPEAKER_04]: Azoic is good.

01:45:02.053 --> 01:45:06.216
[SPEAKER_04]: I was listening to the different drum stuff earlier today when I was trying to find something to play.

01:45:06.857 --> 01:45:09.999
[SPEAKER_24]: But, um, Azoic is good, so I'll give you a 9.

01:45:10.399 --> 01:45:11.500
[SPEAKER_24]: Because Azoic rocks.

01:45:11.980 --> 01:45:14.060
[SPEAKER_04]: and I give that song eleventy billion.

01:45:14.521 --> 01:45:15.541
[SPEAKER_23]: Eleventy billion!

01:45:16.061 --> 01:45:16.861
[SPEAKER_23]: I second that.

01:45:16.941 --> 01:45:18.201
[SPEAKER_04]: Eleventy billion is good.

01:45:18.301 --> 01:45:19.882
[SPEAKER_04]: Eleventy billion for the Ezoic.

01:45:20.182 --> 01:45:21.042
[SPEAKER_23]: Eleventy billion.

01:45:21.462 --> 01:45:23.522
[SPEAKER_23]: Honestly, Ezoic needs more stuff.

01:45:23.563 --> 01:45:34.925
[SPEAKER_04]: There's actually, there's another group that I need, um, music from, but they only had one minute samplers on their site, and it begins with an E, but I can't remember the goddamn name of the stupid band.

01:45:36.645 --> 01:45:37.005
[SPEAKER_04]: Emo?

01:45:37.706 --> 01:45:38.566
[SPEAKER_24]: No, it's not Emo.

01:45:38.646 --> 01:45:39.146
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, um...

01:45:40.447 --> 01:45:40.808
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

01:45:41.148 --> 01:45:41.609
[SPEAKER_04]: Something else.

01:45:41.689 --> 01:45:42.190
[SPEAKER_04]: Who cares?

01:45:42.611 --> 01:45:43.292
[SPEAKER_04]: Song number three.

01:45:43.613 --> 01:45:44.053
[SPEAKER_04]: Your pick.

01:45:44.174 --> 01:45:45.215
[SPEAKER_04]: What'd you pick for us, Loki?

01:45:46.077 --> 01:45:50.324
[SPEAKER_04]: Something from Every Little Thing is from ELT Trance.

01:45:51.721 --> 01:45:52.941
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't remember what the guy's name is.

01:45:52.961 --> 01:45:55.802
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called Feel My Heart, the Mugwai Remix.

01:45:55.842 --> 01:46:01.184
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Feel My Heart, the Mugwai Remix, and it was just kind of cool sounding from what I had.

01:46:01.684 --> 01:46:20.230
[SPEAKER_04]: I had another ELT Trance song that was kind of rock sounding, but it wasn't good enough, so I picked this one, and honestly, right now, I am in no condition to say how good the song was, but I think it was pretty good, so take a listen and enjoy.

01:46:21.658 --> 01:46:22.420
[SPEAKER_04]: I might throw up.

01:46:22.500 --> 01:46:23.283
[SPEAKER_04]: This isn't good.

01:46:23.503 --> 01:46:24.245
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, here we go.

01:46:24.586 --> 01:46:25.910
[SPEAKER_04]: Song number three, every little thing.

01:46:26.210 --> 01:46:26.952
[SPEAKER_16]: Woo!

01:46:27.213 --> 01:46:27.474
[SPEAKER_16]: Woo!

01:47:58.533 --> 01:47:59.695
Thanks for watching!

01:48:42.506 --> 01:48:43.487
Thank you for watching!

01:49:44.481 --> 01:49:45.322
Thank you for watching!

01:50:23.393 --> 01:50:30.915
[SPEAKER_04]: Song number three in tonight's cage match, Every Little Thing, Feel My Heart, the Mugwai remix.

01:50:32.235 --> 01:50:37.157
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see what our people in the room thought about Every Little Thing, Feel My Heart.

01:50:37.997 --> 01:50:39.457
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, Every Little Thing.

01:50:39.657 --> 01:50:39.978
[SPEAKER_04]: Two.

01:50:40.938 --> 01:50:41.438
[SPEAKER_04]: Why is that?

01:50:46.423 --> 01:50:53.491
[SPEAKER_24]: I give it a, um, I don't know, a five?

01:50:54.271 --> 01:50:57.515
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really know because I wasn't listening to it because I was drunk.

01:50:59.285 --> 01:51:06.128
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, the parts I heard sounded neat, but you guys are giving it really low scores, I wouldn't have given it low scores.

01:51:06.148 --> 01:51:14.451
[SPEAKER_23]: It was a pretty good song, I mean, I liked it when I originally picked it out when I was sober, and it was good, okay, that was pretty good.

01:51:14.791 --> 01:51:18.413
[SPEAKER_23]: The original song I had picked out wasn't quite as good, so I'll give it an 8.

01:51:19.778 --> 01:51:29.102
[SPEAKER_23]: But, um, right now, you could play it like, you know, a cat in heat, you know, a sound effect of that, and I would probably give it a 10.

01:51:29.282 --> 01:51:29.582
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

01:51:29.622 --> 01:51:31.123
[SPEAKER_23]: Because I'm just so gone.

01:51:31.143 --> 01:51:35.165
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'll combine 2 plus 5 and give it a 7, because I kind of like that.

01:51:35.265 --> 01:51:36.205
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

01:51:36.485 --> 01:51:39.587
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's listen to three songs you can vote for tonight.

01:51:39.907 --> 01:51:40.647
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, here it is.

01:51:40.967 --> 01:51:44.289
[SPEAKER_04]: Song number one you can vote for tonight, Del the Funky Homo Sapien.

01:51:44.309 --> 01:51:45.929
[SPEAKER_04]: We played three songs already?

01:51:45.949 --> 01:51:46.890
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's already done.

01:51:47.150 --> 01:51:49.311
[SPEAKER_04]: Del the Funky Homo Sapien, Dr. Bombay.

01:51:57.330 --> 01:51:59.832
[SPEAKER_04]: Every time I hear that song, I can't help but think, check and turn.

01:52:01.714 --> 01:52:03.255
[SPEAKER_04]: Here it is, song number two tonight.

01:52:03.535 --> 01:52:04.777
[SPEAKER_04]: Zoic, Let Me Tell You Something.

01:52:13.364 --> 01:52:19.269
[SPEAKER_04]: And song number three you can vote for tonight, Every Little Thing, Feel My Heart, the Mugwai remix.

01:52:22.332 --> 01:52:24.814
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope they're not dragging me out of here tonight.

01:52:26.533 --> 01:52:28.775
[SPEAKER_04]: Place vote now.

01:52:28.915 --> 01:52:34.298
[SPEAKER_04]: Send a private message to Sky in the chatroom with your vote and we'll tally them up.

01:52:34.358 --> 01:52:35.840
[SPEAKER_04]: And hopefully I can keep count tonight.

01:52:36.840 --> 01:52:37.681
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll tally them up.

01:52:38.061 --> 01:52:43.985
[SPEAKER_04]: Please don't post a vote publicly because I don't see those as easily and then I don't tabulate it.

01:52:44.105 --> 01:52:46.427
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's no fun at all when I can't tabulate your vote.

01:52:47.047 --> 01:52:49.369
[SPEAKER_04]: So, how's it going there, Sky?

01:52:50.610 --> 01:52:51.510
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm feeling okay.

01:52:51.631 --> 01:52:53.432
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just... I'm a little...

01:52:54.862 --> 01:53:01.684
[SPEAKER_23]: I have no sense of balance right now and I'm pretty drunk, I think.

01:53:02.464 --> 01:53:03.004
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, me too.

01:53:03.324 --> 01:53:04.644
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm pretty out of it.

01:53:05.345 --> 01:53:10.746
[SPEAKER_23]: I can't focus on you right now, man, because you're all over the place.

01:53:12.566 --> 01:53:16.567
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, I think my family stopped listening, so that's good.

01:53:16.587 --> 01:53:17.447
[SPEAKER_03]: That's probably a good thing.

01:53:17.528 --> 01:53:18.728
[SPEAKER_23]: That's probably a good thing.

01:53:19.568 --> 01:53:23.349
[SPEAKER_23]: And I'm sure I'll get much crap for it tomorrow, but you know what?

01:53:24.226 --> 01:53:28.637
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't care because I'm having a barbecue and it's free food and you know what?

01:53:29.580 --> 01:53:30.221
[SPEAKER_23]: That's all good.

01:53:33.570 --> 01:53:35.492
[SPEAKER_04]: I am so dizzy right now.

01:53:36.413 --> 01:53:39.536
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, I honestly am at the point where I'm like, what do I do with the rest of the show?

01:53:39.617 --> 01:53:44.101
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I could literally run into the wall and I wouldn't feel it because I'm so numb right now.

01:53:44.221 --> 01:53:45.663
[SPEAKER_04]: I was hugging the corner earlier.

01:53:45.703 --> 01:53:47.905
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why, I just felt very comfortable in my head.

01:53:48.346 --> 01:53:50.108
[SPEAKER_04]: My head rested very well in the corner.

01:53:50.128 --> 01:53:51.169
[SPEAKER_23]: It was very interesting.

01:53:51.189 --> 01:53:52.070
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, I saw that.

01:53:52.290 --> 01:53:52.890
[SPEAKER_23]: I saw that.

01:53:53.351 --> 01:53:56.094
[SPEAKER_23]: And people were saying, you know, you're so drunk.

01:53:57.667 --> 01:54:03.772
[SPEAKER_23]: Honestly, folks, I am pretty drunk, but I am still pretty coherent.

01:54:03.992 --> 01:54:12.378
[SPEAKER_23]: I just have no sense of balance whatsoever right now in most of my... Whoa, we're getting feedback, but we're going to try and take this call.

01:54:12.419 --> 01:54:13.199
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange House Radio.

01:54:15.290 --> 01:54:15.670
[SPEAKER_25]: Sorry about that.

01:54:15.690 --> 01:54:16.230
[SPEAKER_25]: Can you hear me now?

01:54:16.530 --> 01:54:16.751
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

01:54:18.651 --> 01:54:19.311
[SPEAKER_25]: It's DeepFell42.

01:54:19.331 --> 01:54:20.672
[SPEAKER_25]: Sorry about that earlier.

01:54:21.072 --> 01:54:21.512
[SPEAKER_25]: That's all right.

01:54:21.532 --> 01:54:22.112
[SPEAKER_25]: What's on your mind?

01:54:22.152 --> 01:54:25.854
[SPEAKER_25]: We're hearing a bad echo, so I'm just going to give you a minute to put out your thoughts.

01:54:25.894 --> 01:54:27.874
[SPEAKER_25]: That was because I forgot to turn my iTunes volume down.

01:54:28.935 --> 01:54:30.535
[SPEAKER_25]: So that was the main reason of that.

01:54:31.876 --> 01:54:32.336
[SPEAKER_04]: What's on your mind?

01:54:32.376 --> 01:54:32.956
[SPEAKER_04]: What's on your mind?

01:54:33.376 --> 01:54:41.699
[SPEAKER_25]: No, I just wanted to let you guys know that if you go to KevinPereira.com, I wanted to let you know how to vote for you guys for Attack of the Show.

01:54:42.599 --> 01:54:42.819
[SPEAKER_19]: Awesome.

01:54:43.019 --> 01:54:44.800
[SPEAKER_25]: If you go to KevinPereira.com

01:54:45.786 --> 01:55:14.377
[SPEAKER_25]: he has a private webcast called Attack of the Webcast sorry, Attack of the Podcast the ingenious clever man that he is naming it that so if you go on and that's where I heard about it if you guys go on to attackoftheshow.com if you go on to their comment section you can fill out comments and how to improve the show and just tell them I just told them that these guys have this great you know

01:55:14.892 --> 01:55:15.692
[SPEAKER_25]: I really appreciate it.

01:55:15.752 --> 01:55:16.152
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm so grateful.

01:55:43.701 --> 01:55:56.712
[SPEAKER_25]: So, I mean, just, I mean, so, everybody go to, well, first of all, if you want to go to Kevin Pereira's Self-Indulgent Crap, just go on to, I think his podcast is registered with iTunes as well.

01:55:57.232 --> 01:56:06.980
[SPEAKER_25]: It's called Attack of the Podcast, and you guys would, you guys just would be so awesome, because ever since it went to Attack of the Show, it's been crap.

01:56:07.460 --> 01:56:10.943
[SPEAKER_25]: Sorry, we weren't listening to you so much that break, because Jamie was modeling for us.

01:56:10.963 --> 01:56:11.564
[SPEAKER_17]: She was so weird.

01:56:15.284 --> 01:56:16.465
[SPEAKER_25]: Where's the webcam for that?

01:56:16.825 --> 01:56:17.865
[SPEAKER_04]: She was just here.

01:56:17.885 --> 01:56:20.265
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know if I might have caught a screenshot.

01:56:20.305 --> 01:56:22.226
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

01:56:23.766 --> 01:56:28.267
[SPEAKER_04]: We're getting really bad echo, so I've got to let you go, but thank you so much for your support.

01:56:28.727 --> 01:56:29.247
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

01:56:29.888 --> 01:56:30.348
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all right.

01:56:30.368 --> 01:56:30.648
[SPEAKER_04]: Take care.

01:56:30.668 --> 01:56:31.968
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep up the good work, all right?

01:56:32.068 --> 01:56:32.488
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

01:56:32.548 --> 01:56:33.668
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a good one.

01:56:33.849 --> 01:56:34.249
[SPEAKER_07]: You too.

01:56:34.469 --> 01:56:34.729
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

01:56:34.749 --> 01:56:35.189
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye-bye.

01:56:35.309 --> 01:56:35.869
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye-bye.

01:56:36.049 --> 01:56:40.070
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm pulling this at the end of my drinking binge right here.

01:56:40.310 --> 01:56:42.451
[SPEAKER_24]: This drink is the last one.

01:56:42.611 --> 01:56:44.613
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm drinking water from here on out, man.

01:57:02.263 --> 01:57:04.785
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm so dizzy right now.

01:57:04.925 --> 01:57:08.508
[SPEAKER_24]: Everything's spinning around and around.

01:57:08.709 --> 01:57:10.570
[SPEAKER_24]: It's just not even funny.

01:57:10.630 --> 01:57:18.457
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm walking out there, my limbs are numb, my hands are numb, my feet are numb, my lips are numb.

01:57:18.597 --> 01:57:22.600
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just walking out there, stumbling around like a complete idiot.

01:57:23.321 --> 01:57:24.221
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not even funny.

01:57:24.301 --> 01:57:28.525
[SPEAKER_04]: But honestly, folks, Destroy All Humans, awesome game.

01:57:28.785 --> 01:57:29.586
[SPEAKER_04]: You can play that game.

01:57:30.962 --> 01:57:33.503
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, we're going to go to a break, boys and girls.

01:57:33.803 --> 01:57:35.244
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do the podcast!

01:57:35.384 --> 01:57:37.205
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we can't do the podcast yet.

01:57:37.245 --> 01:57:38.865
[SPEAKER_04]: The podcast is in another hour.

01:57:38.885 --> 01:57:40.266
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, fine.

01:57:41.286 --> 01:57:42.347
Whee!

01:57:43.567 --> 01:57:50.790
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, we're going to go to a break, and in this break we're going to hear some guitar freaks, drum mania stuff, because I'm going to eat the microphone.

01:57:51.314 --> 01:57:52.414
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to be fun.

01:57:52.755 --> 01:57:54.555
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie looked good in her skirt, didn't she?

01:57:54.575 --> 01:57:55.596
[SPEAKER_04]: Where did she go?

01:57:55.816 --> 01:58:00.518
[SPEAKER_04]: She went to the bathroom because she doesn't think she looks good, but she does.

01:58:00.758 --> 01:58:00.978
[SPEAKER_23]: Why?

01:58:01.058 --> 01:58:02.239
[SPEAKER_23]: She looks incredible.

01:58:02.259 --> 01:58:02.459
[SPEAKER_04]: She does.

01:58:02.479 --> 01:58:03.039
[SPEAKER_04]: She looks fine.

01:58:03.959 --> 01:58:04.660
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

01:58:04.700 --> 01:58:07.261
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just like drunk, so I think everyone looks hot.

01:58:10.022 --> 01:58:10.782
[SPEAKER_23]: Jamie!

01:58:11.403 --> 01:58:12.243
[SPEAKER_23]: Jamie!

01:58:12.583 --> 01:58:13.423
[SPEAKER_23]: Where did you go?

01:58:13.544 --> 01:58:15.444
[SPEAKER_04]: I think she's yelling at us, so we better go to break.

01:58:15.464 --> 01:58:16.165
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I need a drink.

01:58:16.805 --> 01:58:18.125
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you better not have any more drinks.

01:58:18.145 --> 01:58:18.426
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

01:58:18.446 --> 01:58:18.926
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

01:58:20.475 --> 01:58:21.975
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't hold me back.

01:58:22.796 --> 01:58:23.436
[SPEAKER_04]: Break time.

01:58:23.936 --> 01:58:24.656
[SPEAKER_04]: No!

01:58:24.816 --> 01:58:26.517
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, we'll be back after this break.

01:58:26.557 --> 01:58:27.737
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to tally up the cage match votes.

01:58:27.957 --> 01:58:28.437
[SPEAKER_04]: So hurry up.

01:58:28.497 --> 01:58:29.598
[SPEAKER_04]: Last call for cage match votes.

01:58:29.618 --> 01:58:33.659
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank God there's no karaoke revolution now because I don't want to sing.

01:58:33.779 --> 01:58:35.640
[SPEAKER_04]: Starting off with Stop Spinning Me in Circles.

01:58:35.700 --> 01:58:36.140
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be back.

01:58:36.360 --> 01:58:37.980
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm spinning myself.

01:58:41.361 --> 01:58:43.282
[SPEAKER_16]: You've got to tell me what you want.

01:59:07.905 --> 01:59:08.612
Thanks for watching!

01:59:57.717 --> 01:59:58.772
Thanks for watching!

02:00:27.353 --> 02:00:28.914
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for watching!

02:01:03.617 --> 02:01:04.938
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

02:01:32.825 --> 02:01:33.867
Thank you for watching!

02:03:11.888 --> 02:03:12.749
It's great, man!

02:03:59.376 --> 02:04:17.986
Party after party, beauty and money, we were so desperate for perfection But you have made me feel so good, I've only been closer to you I close my eyes, and your love is simple again

02:04:37.354 --> 02:04:39.535
Last week on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:04:39.655 --> 02:04:45.037
Next week on the show we're going to have our very first special guest.

02:05:05.199 --> 02:05:14.269
[SPEAKER_14]: We're actually having over Melody and Melby, and they're going to be our guests on the show, and I get to clean house all week to be ready for them.

02:05:15.170 --> 02:05:15.551
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, God.

02:05:16.071 --> 02:05:19.815
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to move everything out and deliver, because this room's cramped as it is when we do the show here.

02:05:20.056 --> 02:05:22.719
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd have to say so, and quite dirty and moist.

02:05:23.940 --> 02:05:25.542
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you feeling a little moist tonight, Jamie?

02:05:26.351 --> 02:05:27.511
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, every night on the show.

02:05:31.233 --> 02:05:32.693
[SPEAKER_13]: As Irene makes us say.

02:05:33.173 --> 02:05:36.115
[SPEAKER_01]: Orange Lounge Radio makes you moist as a snack.

02:05:36.175 --> 02:05:38.976
[SPEAKER_01]: Join us every Sunday night from 7 p.m.

02:05:39.116 --> 02:05:40.096
[SPEAKER_01]: until 9 p.m.

02:05:40.136 --> 02:05:49.919
[SPEAKER_01]: Pacific Standard Time for the Orange Lounge with your hosts, DarkSakura and Sky, where we'll talk about all things Bomani and then some.

02:05:50.380 --> 02:05:53.841
[SPEAKER_01]: In the meantime, enjoy our Bomani Music and More program.

02:05:54.798 --> 02:06:02.142
[SPEAKER_04]: Another flashback there, an old episode, I don't know, that's like episode 5 or something, I don't know, it's old, it's hecka old.

02:06:03.022 --> 02:06:14.749
[SPEAKER_04]: We're back here on Orange Lounge Radio, and I've been doing a little bit of drinking, and I'm cut off now, and I think Loki is stuck with water now, and DarkSakura, how you doing?

02:06:14.769 --> 02:06:18.311
[SPEAKER_14]: I would love the chat room forever if they tell me how to take those damn ink tags off my clothes.

02:06:19.813 --> 02:06:20.874
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a bunch of crap.

02:06:20.894 --> 02:06:22.535
[SPEAKER_04]: Fucking Hot Topic fucked up.

02:06:22.675 --> 02:06:26.879
[SPEAKER_04]: I can never figure out how you were able to get out of Hot Topic with the tag on.

02:06:26.899 --> 02:06:28.600
[SPEAKER_04]: Because wouldn't it have beeped?

02:06:29.101 --> 02:06:29.521
[SPEAKER_04]: Should have.

02:06:29.921 --> 02:06:30.602
[SPEAKER_04]: Logically.

02:06:30.802 --> 02:06:32.323
[SPEAKER_04]: But now you know how to steal clothes.

02:06:32.824 --> 02:06:33.564
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe you should.

02:06:33.845 --> 02:06:35.066
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to teach them a lesson.

02:06:35.266 --> 02:06:35.386
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

02:06:39.627 --> 02:06:45.090
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura is sounding a little angsty to me, so I think we need to get in the FUs of the week.

02:06:45.150 --> 02:06:48.152
[SPEAKER_04]: However, I do want to announce tonight's cage match winner.

02:06:48.492 --> 02:06:51.833
[SPEAKER_04]: But we didn't have a lot of votes in tonight's cage match, which makes me a sad panda.

02:06:52.074 --> 02:06:53.594
[SPEAKER_04]: Doesn't that make you sad a little bit?

02:06:54.115 --> 02:06:54.475
[SPEAKER_04]: A little.

02:06:55.035 --> 02:06:59.517
[SPEAKER_04]: But we do have a winner nonetheless, because even if there's one vote, one vote is enough to declare the cage match.

02:06:59.537 --> 02:07:02.439
[SPEAKER_04]: So here is tonight's cage match wiener.

02:07:03.799 --> 02:07:04.800
[SPEAKER_04]: The wiener is...

02:07:06.704 --> 02:07:10.166
[SPEAKER_04]: TheOzoic, let me tell you something.

02:07:10.746 --> 02:07:15.229
[SPEAKER_04]: By one vote, one vote for TheOzoic wins tonight's cage match.

02:07:15.269 --> 02:07:16.410
[SPEAKER_04]: Good job, boys and girls.

02:07:17.510 --> 02:07:17.971
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

02:07:21.193 --> 02:07:25.255
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, I think you're wanting to get your angst on, aren't you?

02:07:26.445 --> 02:07:27.006
[SPEAKER_04]: Hot Topic Sucks

02:07:49.698 --> 02:07:53.940
[SPEAKER_14]: So I caught topic for leaving the ink tag on my damn skirt that I was going to wear tonight.

02:07:54.300 --> 02:07:57.381
[SPEAKER_14]: So now I have to find something to wrap the ink tag in while I cut the wire.

02:07:58.541 --> 02:07:58.881
[SPEAKER_14]: That's all.

02:08:00.042 --> 02:08:00.502
[SPEAKER_14]: That's it?

02:08:02.502 --> 02:08:02.923
[SPEAKER_14]: That's it.

02:08:03.823 --> 02:08:04.183
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

02:08:06.504 --> 02:08:09.105
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on, I've got to find Loki's music here.

02:08:09.145 --> 02:08:09.565
[SPEAKER_04]: Here it is.

02:08:10.485 --> 02:08:11.325
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, your turn.

02:08:13.026 --> 02:08:14.907
[SPEAKER_04]: Chat room, you can send in your FUs right now if you want.

02:08:14.947 --> 02:08:15.827
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, here you go, your turn.

02:08:17.608 --> 02:08:26.890
[SPEAKER_24]: The only thing I'm really mad about is how drunk I am, because I felt like I was going to throw up something in the bathroom, but I didn't.

02:08:28.030 --> 02:08:30.651
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank God I'm not that drunk yet, so.

02:08:33.391 --> 02:08:41.073
[SPEAKER_24]: Just F you to how drunk I am, and fuck you to Destroy All Humans, it's been such a short game.

02:08:42.313 --> 02:08:45.194
[SPEAKER_24]: And, uh, that's it.

02:08:47.293 --> 02:08:47.733
[SPEAKER_24]: Alright.

02:08:48.754 --> 02:08:50.976
[SPEAKER_24]: Continue with whoever else is next.

02:08:51.236 --> 02:08:53.577
[SPEAKER_04]: You can cut in the bathtub, just in case.

02:08:54.598 --> 02:08:54.958
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

02:08:55.799 --> 02:08:56.459
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm fine.

02:08:56.499 --> 02:08:58.000
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm just very dizzy.

02:08:59.381 --> 02:08:59.681
[SPEAKER_24]: Are you okay?

02:08:59.701 --> 02:09:00.522
[SPEAKER_24]: Are you gonna pass out?

02:09:01.323 --> 02:09:01.983
[SPEAKER_24]: No, I'm fine.

02:09:03.184 --> 02:09:06.346
[SPEAKER_24]: I felt like I was gonna throw up earlier, but I didn't, so it's good.

02:09:07.166 --> 02:09:08.027
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not angsty?

02:09:09.148 --> 02:09:10.249
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm very drunk.

02:09:10.389 --> 02:09:15.272
[SPEAKER_24]: Like, I don't have the energy to be angsty, so... It's good.

02:09:17.606 --> 02:09:17.947
[SPEAKER_24]: Manama!

02:09:17.967 --> 02:09:18.367
[SPEAKER_24]: Manama!

02:09:19.870 --> 02:09:20.490
[SPEAKER_24]: Manama!

02:09:32.685 --> 02:09:36.488
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't find my song, that's why I'm stalling.

02:09:36.548 --> 02:09:37.949
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you sure you don't have anything else?

02:09:38.470 --> 02:09:40.792
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

02:09:40.812 --> 02:09:52.601
[SPEAKER_23]: The only thing I have is why the hell did my family decide to listen to this show now when I'm drunk instead of like normally when I'm doing a normal show.

02:09:53.922 --> 02:10:08.867
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't understand that kind of stuff, but whatever, you know, they know I'm drunk and I know they know that I'm not normally drunk, so I am way wasted right now.

02:10:10.447 --> 02:10:12.988
[SPEAKER_23]: I am so dizzy it's not even funny.

02:10:15.789 --> 02:10:16.469
[SPEAKER_24]: Manamana.

02:10:19.790 --> 02:10:20.911
[SPEAKER_24]: Manamana.

02:10:21.571 --> 02:10:21.891
[SPEAKER_24]: Any luck?

02:10:24.656 --> 02:10:27.678
[SPEAKER_24]: I can't even see you people because you're so damn drunk.

02:10:32.099 --> 02:10:35.040
[SPEAKER_04]: The chat room is noticing how slow your speech got all of a sudden.

02:10:35.300 --> 02:10:36.341
[SPEAKER_04]: How many drinks did you have again?

02:10:38.682 --> 02:10:41.002
[SPEAKER_04]: Four double shots.

02:10:41.022 --> 02:10:46.404
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's empty.

02:10:47.565 --> 02:10:48.285
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god.

02:10:48.405 --> 02:10:48.925
[SPEAKER_04]: My turn.

02:10:49.205 --> 02:10:49.605
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut up, Loki.

02:10:49.665 --> 02:10:50.066
[SPEAKER_04]: It's my turn.

02:10:50.406 --> 02:10:50.606
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

02:10:57.826 --> 02:11:04.810
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I'm giving you an F you to the motherfucker who broke into my car for the second time nonetheless.

02:11:05.350 --> 02:11:06.771
[SPEAKER_04]: Fool me once, shame on you.

02:11:06.831 --> 02:11:08.052
[SPEAKER_04]: Fool me twice, shame on me.

02:11:08.132 --> 02:11:08.812
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate you.

02:11:09.313 --> 02:11:10.693
[SPEAKER_04]: Why did you have to do that to me?

02:11:10.894 --> 02:11:12.014
[SPEAKER_04]: I am a nice guy.

02:11:12.054 --> 02:11:14.135
[SPEAKER_04]: A nice guy should not have the car broken into.

02:11:14.215 --> 02:11:14.936
[SPEAKER_04]: And just...

02:11:15.775 --> 02:11:22.617
[SPEAKER_04]: F you to the fact that I didn't have a car alarm, but I shouldn't have to get an alarm, because people should have the common fucking decency not to break into your shit.

02:11:23.217 --> 02:11:32.859
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope you enjoy the stereo, I hope it blows up on you, and I hope you get gonorrhea and die of SARS, because you're just an asshole who steals things from people, who steals things that aren't yours.

02:11:33.600 --> 02:11:39.741
[SPEAKER_04]: And now I'm gonna have to rent a garage because of you, and that's $70 a month, I'm out the money, because you can't keep your hands off my shit.

02:11:40.021 --> 02:11:42.362
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep your hands off my shit, you shit-eater!

02:11:44.699 --> 02:11:47.361
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, an FU to that.

02:11:48.722 --> 02:11:51.104
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's go to the chatroom FUs.

02:11:55.847 --> 02:12:01.251
[SPEAKER_04]: Dark Knight says, my FU is going to be for my job to have me work on the 4th, bitches.

02:12:06.274 --> 02:12:11.197
[SPEAKER_04]: Dark Knight says, if it's a certain tag, all you need to do is pinch one of the tags.

02:12:11.678 --> 02:12:13.059
[SPEAKER_04]: So get like a pair of pliers.

02:12:15.430 --> 02:12:22.578
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, the way that this one is, it's got the clear tag with the blue ink and the yellow ink.

02:12:22.738 --> 02:12:24.059
[SPEAKER_14]: You can see through the tag.

02:12:24.440 --> 02:12:29.585
[SPEAKER_14]: The other side has a long part that's attached to a more cylindrical looking part with a domed end.

02:12:30.185 --> 02:12:33.008
[SPEAKER_14]: You can see a thin wire connecting the two.

02:12:33.769 --> 02:12:43.995
[SPEAKER_14]: What I am concerned about is that without having anything to wrap it in, if I cut the wire because it is magnetically charged, at the point it senses the magnetic disruption, it will explode the ink.

02:12:44.676 --> 02:12:45.756
[SPEAKER_14]: I have nothing to wrap it in.

02:12:47.537 --> 02:12:48.818
[SPEAKER_14]: So yeah, find me a way around that.

02:12:53.921 --> 02:12:56.503
[SPEAKER_04]: Illusion says F you to Loki and his slurred speech.

02:13:03.756 --> 02:13:04.576
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, where else are we?

02:13:05.357 --> 02:13:10.681
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, Chimera says, F you to swimming at... Chimera says, F you to... I'm drunk.

02:13:11.062 --> 02:13:13.183
[SPEAKER_04]: F you to swimming at 6 in the goddamn morning.

02:13:15.025 --> 02:13:15.385
[SPEAKER_04]: You okay?

02:13:15.445 --> 02:13:15.886
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki!

02:13:16.726 --> 02:13:17.207
[SPEAKER_04]: You okay?

02:13:17.627 --> 02:13:19.168
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki just fell on the floor.

02:13:19.709 --> 02:13:20.129
[SPEAKER_04]: Is he okay?

02:13:20.149 --> 02:13:20.790
[SPEAKER_04]: Should I just leave him?

02:13:22.891 --> 02:13:23.212
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

02:13:26.167 --> 02:13:52.937
[SPEAKER_04]: Aguanagirl says, my F you is too emotion, and I don't think this is the song either I've had a horribly emotional week, finally got my cry on this afternoon, so I'm feeling better, but yeah Fuck you to everything hitting you all at once to where you feel piled on top of with drama Ranchan says, F you to New York State, you fucker owe me an unemployment check

02:13:55.202 --> 02:13:59.285
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkTetsuya says, seconded on the F you to the bastards who broke into your car.

02:13:59.686 --> 02:14:01.547
[SPEAKER_04]: Same thing happened to my mom some years ago.

02:14:04.370 --> 02:14:11.095
[SPEAKER_04]: Illusion says, F you to my Target interview sucking and me being pretty sure I didn't get the job.

02:14:13.417 --> 02:14:20.183
[SPEAKER_04]: VidPalace says, F you to homework over holiday weekends and F you to my DVD case being cracked in the mail.

02:14:21.775 --> 02:14:28.777
[SPEAKER_04]: and DeepThought42 says, F you to the Hillary Clinton for saying that video games are to blame for your kids' sociopathic behavior.

02:14:28.837 --> 02:14:30.657
[SPEAKER_08]: It's your fucking parents' fault!

02:14:31.458 --> 02:14:32.298
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn straight.

02:14:37.059 --> 02:14:37.579
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's it.

02:14:38.600 --> 02:14:40.360
[SPEAKER_04]: That's our chatter's F yous.

02:14:40.420 --> 02:14:41.500
[SPEAKER_04]: They're kind of anxious.

02:14:41.640 --> 02:14:42.321
[SPEAKER_04]: Is he okay?

02:14:42.341 --> 02:14:44.601
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

02:14:44.841 --> 02:14:48.142
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the first time, this is probably the only time he's going to bow down to your feet, though.

02:14:48.782 --> 02:14:49.182
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey!

02:14:50.983 --> 02:14:51.123
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm

02:14:51.798 --> 02:14:53.939
[SPEAKER_24]: Perfectly fine.

02:14:59.702 --> 02:15:02.543
[SPEAKER_04]: I really don't know what to do with the rest of the show, boys and girls.

02:15:02.903 --> 02:15:04.304
[SPEAKER_09]: I can entertain people, I'm sober.

02:15:04.564 --> 02:15:06.665
[SPEAKER_04]: Nellie, what do you want to do to entertain our listeners?

02:15:07.486 --> 02:15:09.046
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I don't know.

02:15:09.627 --> 02:15:11.468
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's hear some Matt's wisdom.

02:15:11.948 --> 02:15:13.028
[SPEAKER_09]: Matt's drunken wisdom.

02:15:13.809 --> 02:15:14.069
[SPEAKER_09]: Burp.

02:15:14.689 --> 02:15:17.751
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm so tired.

02:15:19.531 --> 02:15:19.952
[SPEAKER_04]: Whew.

02:15:22.285 --> 02:15:23.966
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, DeepThought42 had another one.

02:15:24.146 --> 02:15:27.288
[SPEAKER_04]: F you to my fucking computer for causing that fucking echo on the air.

02:15:28.689 --> 02:15:29.049
[SPEAKER_04]: Amen.

02:15:31.171 --> 02:15:32.091
[SPEAKER_04]: Where did Extifer go?

02:15:32.131 --> 02:15:33.953
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't kick him in the butt when he's passed out.

02:15:33.973 --> 02:15:34.653
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not nice.

02:15:34.673 --> 02:15:35.253
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't fall asleep.

02:15:35.394 --> 02:15:38.115
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not falling asleep.

02:15:38.255 --> 02:15:41.878
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just tired.

02:15:48.115 --> 02:15:50.036
[SPEAKER_04]: I really don't know what to do with the show at this point.

02:15:50.837 --> 02:15:52.858
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to a break.

02:15:53.078 --> 02:15:55.860
[SPEAKER_04]: That's always a good thing to do when the show is going crazy.

02:15:56.660 --> 02:15:59.482
[SPEAKER_04]: My stomach is full of... Almohal.

02:16:00.662 --> 02:16:01.183
[SPEAKER_04]: Almohal?

02:16:02.303 --> 02:16:03.184
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki is rambling.

02:16:03.704 --> 02:16:06.266
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to give Loki some time to cheer up.

02:16:06.646 --> 02:16:08.427
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, you said you wanted to hear something earlier.

02:16:08.447 --> 02:16:08.927
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you want to hear?

02:16:09.147 --> 02:16:09.527
[SPEAKER_11]: I forgot.

02:16:10.628 --> 02:16:12.409
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, anything off the top of your head?

02:16:13.513 --> 02:16:13.853
[SPEAKER_04]: Taku.

02:16:14.393 --> 02:16:14.854
[SPEAKER_04]: Taku.

02:16:16.314 --> 02:16:18.055
[SPEAKER_04]: Voltage by the one and only Taku.

02:16:18.095 --> 02:16:18.415
[SPEAKER_04]: How's that?

02:16:19.495 --> 02:16:19.855
[SPEAKER_04]: It works.

02:16:20.175 --> 02:16:20.476
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:16:20.916 --> 02:16:21.736
[SPEAKER_04]: Some 2DX then.

02:16:21.756 --> 02:16:23.537
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll do a 2DX break.

02:16:23.797 --> 02:16:26.258
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.

02:16:26.298 --> 02:16:27.358
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe some Ask Orange Lounge.

02:16:27.658 --> 02:16:28.699
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever we can come up with.

02:16:28.799 --> 02:16:29.259
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be back.

02:18:09.560 --> 02:18:10.401
Thanks for watching!

02:18:34.351 --> 02:18:34.972
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks for watching!

02:19:58.021 --> 02:19:59.802
[SPEAKER_16]: Stand by your friends who's wild

02:20:31.998 --> 02:20:33.279
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

02:21:10.206 --> 02:21:14.868
Thanks for watching!

02:22:14.936 --> 02:22:16.101
Thank you for watching!

02:23:11.875 --> 02:23:14.656
[SPEAKER_01]: Last week on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:23:36.247 --> 02:23:40.368
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, is that trying to spin off on Iron Chef, like Iron 2DX?

02:23:41.148 --> 02:23:44.109
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know, it's like Tekken for 2DX.

02:23:44.929 --> 02:23:46.429
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, the king of iron fingering.

02:23:47.589 --> 02:23:48.290
[SPEAKER_14]: Whoa!

02:23:49.190 --> 02:23:52.210
[SPEAKER_14]: Never mind, I said another... Remember that part about adult content?

02:23:54.571 --> 02:23:58.792
[SPEAKER_14]: I was referring to this in a completely innocent manner, you pervert.

02:24:00.447 --> 02:24:01.548
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

02:24:27.426 --> 02:24:29.087
[SPEAKER_22]: Another classic bite there.

02:24:30.368 --> 02:24:30.768
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes?

02:24:33.009 --> 02:24:33.389
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

02:24:34.270 --> 02:24:41.213
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, we just had an incident in the studio, so we needed to do one more song, guys, and we'll explain what's going on when we come back.

02:24:41.433 --> 02:24:43.955
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I've got to run and get something real quick.

02:24:44.755 --> 02:24:46.336
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll explain what's going on when we come back.

02:24:48.877 --> 02:24:50.438
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you doing over there, DarkSakura?

02:24:51.538 --> 02:24:52.459
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm almost sober again.

02:24:54.352 --> 02:24:57.415
[SPEAKER_14]: You know my tolerance, and you know how fucking much it takes me.

02:24:57.435 --> 02:25:00.498
[SPEAKER_04]: What just happened surprisingly sobered me up, especially.

02:25:00.598 --> 02:25:01.639
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll be back right after this.

02:25:01.699 --> 02:25:02.700
[SPEAKER_14]: I just sat here going, wow.

02:25:04.462 --> 02:25:07.485
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be back right after this song from Extreme USA with more Orange Lounge.

02:25:24.347 --> 02:25:25.829
Thank you for watching!

02:25:46.869 --> 02:25:47.690
Love, love, love

02:26:11.680 --> 02:26:23.466
Simply Be In Love Simply Be In Love Simply Be In Love Simply Be In Love Simply Be In Love Simply Be In Love Simply Be In Love

02:26:40.117 --> 02:26:51.561
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, we're back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:26:51.601 --> 02:26:54.422
[SPEAKER_04]: That was BT, Simply Being Loved.

02:26:56.143 --> 02:26:59.865
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so, gosh, how do we explain this?

02:27:01.245 --> 02:27:03.706
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically what happened during the last break there... Loki puked!

02:27:03.846 --> 02:27:05.527
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, basically Loki farted.

02:27:07.087 --> 02:27:07.628
[SPEAKER_06]: On his pants.

02:27:07.648 --> 02:27:09.068
[SPEAKER_06]: He didn't quite make it to the toilet.

02:27:09.088 --> 02:27:10.029
[SPEAKER_06]: He just kind of sat there.

02:27:10.049 --> 02:27:11.970
[SPEAKER_04]: He just sat there and said, oh, bleh.

02:27:12.110 --> 02:27:14.251
[SPEAKER_04]: And then suddenly he was like, I have an announcement.

02:27:14.451 --> 02:27:14.872
[SPEAKER_04]: Bleh.

02:27:16.593 --> 02:27:17.533
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're not sure.

02:27:17.593 --> 02:27:19.314
[SPEAKER_04]: There's one more spot that needs to be wiped up, too.

02:27:19.974 --> 02:27:22.216
[SPEAKER_04]: So... I hope not.

02:27:22.596 --> 02:27:25.217
[SPEAKER_04]: So he's being addressed by Nellie right now.

02:27:25.518 --> 02:27:28.019
[SPEAKER_04]: Surprisingly, that sobered me up to have that happen.

02:27:28.159 --> 02:27:30.781
[SPEAKER_14]: I've been sitting here sober for the past 10, 15 minutes.

02:27:30.801 --> 02:27:30.841
[SPEAKER_14]: So...

02:27:35.136 --> 02:27:37.078
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm wearing my skirt with the tag tonight.

02:27:38.920 --> 02:27:40.222
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to fucking be hot if it kills me.

02:27:40.242 --> 02:27:41.223
[SPEAKER_14]: Girl, you are already hot.

02:27:54.577 --> 02:27:56.698
[SPEAKER_04]: We still have a podcast we got to do after this.

02:27:56.878 --> 02:27:57.998
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what we're going to do.

02:27:59.739 --> 02:28:01.399
[SPEAKER_04]: The final drink count.

02:28:01.499 --> 02:28:03.160
[SPEAKER_04]: What is tonight's final drink count?

02:28:03.560 --> 02:28:05.201
[SPEAKER_04]: How much did you have to drink, DarkSakura?

02:28:07.081 --> 02:28:07.521
[SPEAKER_14]: Ten shots.

02:28:08.122 --> 02:28:13.003
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I finished off with a nine because I had eight shots of Malibu and then a Guinness, which counts as one shot.

02:28:13.023 --> 02:28:14.504
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki had ten shots, but he puked.

02:28:15.124 --> 02:28:15.704
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki had how much?

02:28:16.104 --> 02:28:16.324
[SPEAKER_14]: Ten.

02:28:16.504 --> 02:28:17.085
[SPEAKER_04]: Ten, but he puked.

02:28:17.105 --> 02:28:17.825
[SPEAKER_14]: But I'm sober.

02:28:19.105 --> 02:28:23.967
[SPEAKER_04]: If I had had one more shot, I probably would have puked because I was at that point where I was like, I'm going to barf, but I didn't.

02:28:24.528 --> 02:28:33.093
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

02:28:49.771 --> 02:28:51.492
[SPEAKER_04]: One of them you passed out in my bed.

02:28:51.592 --> 02:28:52.432
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't pass out.

02:28:52.712 --> 02:28:54.812
[SPEAKER_14]: Remember, I was making commentary from your bedroom.

02:28:55.313 --> 02:28:58.973
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the closest that we've had to a barfing experience.

02:28:59.174 --> 02:29:00.454
[SPEAKER_14]: I did not pass out, however.

02:29:01.834 --> 02:29:04.075
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you remember I was screaming at you from your bedroom?

02:29:04.355 --> 02:29:05.035
[SPEAKER_04]: I vaguely remember.

02:29:05.055 --> 02:29:05.715
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the same episode.

02:29:05.735 --> 02:29:08.456
[SPEAKER_13]: And then I went, Waffle!

02:29:08.876 --> 02:29:14.537
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the same episode where I was kicking the wall, running up and down, yelling, I'm in the Matrix, I'm in the Matrix.

02:29:15.598 --> 02:29:16.358
[SPEAKER_14]: That was great.

02:29:17.179 --> 02:29:17.739
[SPEAKER_04]: Did it happen again?

02:29:17.759 --> 02:29:18.420
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you okay?

02:29:18.700 --> 02:29:19.640
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought you were sober.

02:29:19.700 --> 02:29:20.520
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't look sober.

02:29:21.301 --> 02:29:24.222
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki, keep... Okay, I'm going to get Loki some cookies.

02:29:24.302 --> 02:29:25.282
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, pick up the microphone.

02:29:25.623 --> 02:29:26.563
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you pick up the microphone down there?

02:29:28.284 --> 02:29:29.304
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought he was sobering up.

02:29:29.344 --> 02:29:30.084
[SPEAKER_04]: He looks drunker.

02:29:30.445 --> 02:29:30.765
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello?

02:29:31.885 --> 02:29:33.046
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell the charm how you're feeling.

02:29:33.966 --> 02:29:36.347
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm feeling incredibly dizzy.

02:29:37.187 --> 02:29:39.548
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think I just threw up earlier.

02:29:40.069 --> 02:29:40.569
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you did.

02:29:41.129 --> 02:29:43.150
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you're wearing my clothes now, might I point out.

02:29:43.350 --> 02:29:44.270
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, I am.

02:29:44.971 --> 02:29:44.991
[SPEAKER_24]: I...

02:29:46.343 --> 02:29:56.806
[SPEAKER_24]: I've drank too much, honestly, normally I drink a lot more water to coincide with my, you know, drinking alcohol, so I don't feel like, you know, I have to eat a cookie.

02:29:56.826 --> 02:29:58.266
[SPEAKER_24]: No, I don't, I'm not hungry.

02:30:00.927 --> 02:30:02.908
[SPEAKER_24]: I can't eat the cookie right now, honestly.

02:30:03.388 --> 02:30:08.049
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't care if you can eat it or not, fucking eat the cookie to neutralize the alcohol in your stomach.

02:30:08.789 --> 02:30:10.290
[SPEAKER_23]: I will be sick, honestly.

02:30:13.011 --> 02:30:14.311
[SPEAKER_23]: Just give me a second to

02:30:14.824 --> 02:30:21.566
[SPEAKER_23]: Freaking, you know, honestly, I just, just give me some water and I'll be fine, okay?

02:30:23.047 --> 02:30:32.350
[SPEAKER_23]: Because if I drink anymore, I'm honestly very full right now, and I can't drink anymore, you know, alcohol or anything, to be, you know, honest.

02:30:33.430 --> 02:30:36.791
[SPEAKER_23]: I just, I feel honestly tired as hell.

02:30:38.232 --> 02:30:41.453
[SPEAKER_23]: This is why you shouldn't drink, folks, I mean, honestly.

02:30:42.133 --> 02:31:09.737
[SPEAKER_24]: because you'll end up like me, and that's not good, but, um, just, just whatever, I mean, honestly, thank God my family stopped listening to this show, like, long ago, so, it's not good, just don't go crazy with the alcohol, and just take it easy, you know, have some fun at the fireworks, and whatnot, and whatever.

02:31:11.283 --> 02:31:12.604
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm tired, I need a nap.

02:31:13.945 --> 02:31:16.507
[SPEAKER_00]: Just don't fall asleep and get my computer wet with that water.

02:31:17.148 --> 02:31:27.396
[SPEAKER_23]: No, I'm not, I'm taking care of the computer, because I built this computer, so I know what it needs, you know, it does not need the excess alcohol dripped all over it.

02:31:28.096 --> 02:31:31.339
[SPEAKER_23]: So, you know.

02:31:31.839 --> 02:31:33.040
[SPEAKER_23]: What the hell are you playing?

02:31:35.802 --> 02:31:46.946
[SPEAKER_23]: I mean, it's bad enough that my stomach hurts, I mean, so, folks, people, take it easy on the alcohol, don't go crazy with the fire, you're good, okay.

02:31:50.327 --> 02:31:52.188
[SPEAKER_04]: What does the 4th of July mean to you, Loki?

02:31:56.489 --> 02:31:58.870
[SPEAKER_04]: Turn on your mic, turn on your mic, your mic's off.

02:32:01.380 --> 02:32:02.520
[SPEAKER_04]: What is the 4th of July Meteor?

02:32:02.781 --> 02:32:13.725
[SPEAKER_23]: It means crappy fireworks that they've, like, totally toned down because people like me that get drunk and decide to light fireworks, so... You know what?

02:32:14.125 --> 02:32:29.611
[SPEAKER_24]: Honestly, people, if I'm spending money on fireworks, I want them to be, you know, extremely explosive, so... I am so tired right now, it's not even funny, it's like... I feel like I'm asleep, so...

02:32:31.559 --> 02:32:32.620
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't care, whatever.

02:32:32.680 --> 02:32:34.641
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you learned a lesson from today's episode?

02:32:36.102 --> 02:32:40.064
[SPEAKER_24]: My lesson from today's episode is drink more water before I start drinking.

02:32:41.325 --> 02:32:42.706
[SPEAKER_14]: Other than that, I have learned a thing.

02:32:42.726 --> 02:32:45.108
[SPEAKER_14]: The lesson of the evening is no one can fucking out drink me.

02:32:45.328 --> 02:32:46.168
[SPEAKER_14]: Ha ha ha.

02:32:48.570 --> 02:32:49.070
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.

02:32:49.090 --> 02:32:50.531
[SPEAKER_04]: I will go back to the liquor bottle.

02:32:52.973 --> 02:32:53.973
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever, Jamie.

02:32:54.333 --> 02:32:55.574
[SPEAKER_14]: We do shots at the club tonight.

02:32:55.814 --> 02:32:56.075
[SPEAKER_04]: Fine.

02:32:57.756 --> 02:32:59.777
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm becoming more coherent.

02:33:08.649 --> 02:33:10.770
[SPEAKER_04]: Suddenly Loki went into velociraptor mode.

02:33:13.792 --> 02:33:14.992
[SPEAKER_23]: Listen, folks, okay?

02:33:15.372 --> 02:33:18.554
[SPEAKER_23]: The room is spinning a lot less than it was before, okay?

02:33:19.795 --> 02:33:20.135
[SPEAKER_23]: Water?

02:33:20.275 --> 02:33:20.975
[SPEAKER_23]: I have water?

02:33:21.876 --> 02:33:22.496
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, yay.

02:33:24.737 --> 02:33:26.538
[SPEAKER_04]: Just think, Nellie, you get to go home with that.

02:33:28.879 --> 02:33:29.780
[SPEAKER_23]: Listen, okay?

02:33:31.280 --> 02:33:33.722
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, I'll sleep on the edge of the bed, I'm fine.

02:33:34.342 --> 02:33:35.222
[SPEAKER_23]: But you know what?

02:33:35.623 --> 02:33:38.204
[SPEAKER_23]: When I become sober, ooh yeah.

02:33:39.011 --> 02:33:40.852
[SPEAKER_09]: Then what's gonna happen?

02:33:40.872 --> 02:33:41.392
Oh yeah.

02:33:43.913 --> 02:33:45.754
[SPEAKER_23]: Don't you be making fun of me now, okay?

02:33:45.774 --> 02:33:49.575
[SPEAKER_23]: Cause when I'm sober, you aren't complaining, okay?

02:33:50.976 --> 02:33:52.376
[SPEAKER_13]: He thinks he's gonna get some.

02:33:52.396 --> 02:33:53.017
[SPEAKER_13]: Is he?

02:33:53.717 --> 02:33:55.658
[SPEAKER_13]: Once he's sober, yes.

02:33:56.758 --> 02:33:58.779
[SPEAKER_23]: Damn straight I'm gonna get some.

02:33:59.959 --> 02:34:02.380
[SPEAKER_23]: When I'm sober, it's not complaining.

02:34:02.600 --> 02:34:04.021
[SPEAKER_09]: When there's no puke on his breath.

02:34:04.908 --> 02:34:06.009
[SPEAKER_09]: and when he can get it up.

02:34:06.129 --> 02:34:07.289
[SPEAKER_04]: You need a breath mint?

02:34:07.549 --> 02:34:09.030
[SPEAKER_04]: Extover, don't you have some breath mints somewhere?

02:34:09.050 --> 02:34:10.071
[SPEAKER_04]: I have penguin mints.

02:34:11.091 --> 02:34:15.674
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, folks, okay, Rob is like, he's all over the place.

02:34:15.694 --> 02:34:16.614
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, I'm sober now.

02:34:17.054 --> 02:34:17.815
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go driving.

02:34:17.955 --> 02:34:18.395
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just kidding.

02:34:18.455 --> 02:34:19.595
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm totally kidding.

02:34:19.896 --> 02:34:23.337
[SPEAKER_23]: If I were to run towards Rob, I would probably hit the wall.

02:34:25.438 --> 02:34:26.739
[SPEAKER_14]: So what type of drunk am I?

02:34:26.819 --> 02:34:29.260
[SPEAKER_23]: My nose is numb, okay?

02:34:29.360 --> 02:34:30.161
[SPEAKER_23]: My hand is numb.

02:34:30.181 --> 02:34:31.081
[SPEAKER_14]: So what about my drinking?

02:34:31.141 --> 02:34:32.562
[SPEAKER_14]: If Rob gets stupid, what about me?

02:34:36.991 --> 02:34:38.553
[SPEAKER_14]: Rob, I am gonna be at that... Microphone towards mouth.

02:34:38.573 --> 02:34:39.494
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

02:34:39.514 --> 02:34:42.197
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob, I am gonna be totally at that stupid convention thing.

02:34:42.237 --> 02:34:43.218
[SPEAKER_14]: When they have the people...

02:34:59.156 --> 02:35:04.340
[SPEAKER_04]: That shit already happened last Sunday.

02:35:04.500 --> 02:35:05.101
[SPEAKER_04]: You weren't there.

02:35:05.201 --> 02:35:06.222
[SPEAKER_04]: It happened last Sunday.

02:35:06.302 --> 02:35:06.822
[SPEAKER_04]: Where were you?

02:35:06.862 --> 02:35:07.463
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn it.

02:35:08.664 --> 02:35:12.367
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, fucking A. I'm going to be at the other thing.

02:35:12.427 --> 02:35:13.628
[SPEAKER_04]: It's at Paradise Island.

02:35:16.230 --> 02:35:17.531
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm so sick.

02:35:17.551 --> 02:35:23.656
[SPEAKER_14]: Sigh.

02:35:28.271 --> 02:35:29.992
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, have you learned any lessons tonight?

02:35:30.732 --> 02:35:31.072
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

02:35:32.873 --> 02:35:33.813
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you going to drink again?

02:35:34.333 --> 02:35:34.693
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

02:35:37.194 --> 02:35:39.755
[SPEAKER_04]: What will you do differently when you drink next time?

02:35:40.155 --> 02:35:41.835
[SPEAKER_04]: Have more food beforehand.

02:35:51.398 --> 02:35:56.100
[SPEAKER_14]: I have officially out-drinked everybody because I finished my beer within two minutes of opening it.

02:36:07.474 --> 02:36:08.215
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you okay, Loki?

02:36:09.295 --> 02:36:11.958
[SPEAKER_24]: I am perfectly fine.

02:36:14.060 --> 02:36:17.743
[SPEAKER_24]: No, honestly, my stomach feels a little upset, but other than that, I'm fine.

02:36:19.765 --> 02:36:20.385
[SPEAKER_24]: No, you're fine.

02:36:22.648 --> 02:36:23.869
[SPEAKER_24]: I'M FINE!

02:36:24.892 --> 02:36:33.135
[SPEAKER_24]: Don't be, don't be judging me just because I had a lot of like acid in my stomach from the stupid minestrone.

02:36:36.076 --> 02:36:38.017
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm fine right now, okay?

02:36:38.097 --> 02:36:40.398
[SPEAKER_24]: If I drink some more water, I'll be fine.

02:36:44.299 --> 02:36:46.440
[SPEAKER_24]: Just, I'm drinking water, okay?

02:36:53.959 --> 02:36:56.401
[SPEAKER_14]: What the fuck is with this music, okay?

02:36:57.081 --> 02:36:59.243
[SPEAKER_14]: You need to fucking turn this shit off.

02:36:59.583 --> 02:37:01.625
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm playing something that doesn't lick my ass.

02:37:02.546 --> 02:37:04.847
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm fine, I just feel ill.

02:37:09.211 --> 02:37:13.394
[SPEAKER_14]: I need to put my thumb on the webcam because my thumb is mutilated now thanks to Guinness.

02:37:17.555 --> 02:37:23.219
[SPEAKER_04]: I really don't know what to say to our listeners who have stuck with us through such crap radio tonight.

02:37:23.919 --> 02:37:28.662
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh oh, uh oh, oh god, Loki's going to barf again.

02:37:28.702 --> 02:37:29.383
[SPEAKER_04]: Is he going to barf again?

02:37:29.723 --> 02:37:31.364
[SPEAKER_04]: Nelly, please make sure his head lands in my toilet.

02:37:38.389 --> 02:37:39.950
[SPEAKER_06]: Ew, I just heard that.

02:37:41.718 --> 02:37:43.159
[SPEAKER_14]: I hope you boys and girls learned something from this.

02:37:43.179 --> 02:37:45.522
[SPEAKER_14]: Drinking so much turns you into an ass.

02:37:45.542 --> 02:37:46.142
[SPEAKER_14]: A complete and utter ass.

02:38:02.455 --> 02:38:11.157
[SPEAKER_13]: Drinking makes me horny.

02:38:11.197 --> 02:38:13.478
[SPEAKER_14]: Drinking makes me a cuddle whore.

02:38:15.338 --> 02:38:18.919
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to hug everybody.

02:38:22.240 --> 02:38:25.220
[SPEAKER_14]: I need waffles and spinach with no water.

02:38:25.740 --> 02:38:26.100
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

02:38:26.140 --> 02:38:27.701
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm almost thinking we ought to end the show.

02:38:27.781 --> 02:38:28.401
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we're just...

02:38:28.846 --> 02:38:31.889
[SPEAKER_14]: We've got 15 minutes to go.

02:38:31.909 --> 02:38:32.410
[SPEAKER_14]: Go to a break.

02:38:32.430 --> 02:38:33.151
[SPEAKER_04]: You want a little break?

02:38:33.511 --> 02:38:34.792
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, we'll think of something to fill up.

02:38:34.973 --> 02:38:36.794
[SPEAKER_14]: When we come back, it's Ask Orange Lounge.

02:38:36.935 --> 02:38:38.076
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, Ask Orange Lounge.

02:38:38.436 --> 02:38:42.020
[SPEAKER_04]: Send us questions and we'll get them in this next segment.

02:38:42.080 --> 02:38:43.101
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Ask Orange Lounge.

02:38:44.803 --> 02:38:46.745
[SPEAKER_14]: In the meantime... Oh, that burp tastes like Guinness.

02:38:47.185 --> 02:38:48.487
[SPEAKER_14]: I have had 11 drinks tonight.

02:38:49.708 --> 02:38:50.369
[SPEAKER_04]: Good job.

02:38:51.417 --> 02:38:52.899
[SPEAKER_14]: Will you just barf again?

02:38:53.179 --> 02:38:54.681
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I'm going to go take care of it.

02:38:54.821 --> 02:38:57.244
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, we're going to go look and admire it.

02:38:57.905 --> 02:38:58.405
[SPEAKER_04]: Cheek break!

02:38:58.806 --> 02:39:03.952
[SPEAKER_04]: Send a message to Skye if you have a question for Ask Orange Lounge.

02:39:03.972 --> 02:39:06.955
[SPEAKER_04]: In the meantime, we're going to get to... Bomani Potpourri, boys and girls.

02:39:07.937 --> 02:39:08.758
[SPEAKER_04]: Started off with...

02:39:10.350 --> 02:39:10.750
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

02:39:11.270 --> 02:39:14.871
[SPEAKER_04]: How about something from 2DX10th style?

02:39:16.092 --> 02:39:17.292
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm by myself right now.

02:39:17.312 --> 02:39:18.192
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of scary.

02:39:18.332 --> 02:39:21.493
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm starting to sober up, but I'm still... I'm like in that buzzed phase.

02:39:24.414 --> 02:39:28.335
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be back with more of this fun stuff.

02:39:28.815 --> 02:39:30.615
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll talk about video games at some point, too.

02:39:30.835 --> 02:39:31.236
[SPEAKER_04]: Meteos.

02:39:31.496 --> 02:39:31.916
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool game.

02:39:32.136 --> 02:39:32.416
[SPEAKER_04]: Play it.

02:41:47.418 --> 02:41:53.200
[SPEAKER_15]: Boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob

02:42:08.547 --> 02:42:10.729
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for watching!

02:42:41.226 --> 02:42:42.871
Thank you for watching!

02:44:01.084 --> 02:44:01.725
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you for watching!

02:46:17.651 --> 02:46:20.513
[SPEAKER_01]: Last week on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:46:20.993 --> 02:46:22.815
[SPEAKER_04]: Who was the last person to put their coin up?

02:46:23.275 --> 02:46:24.576
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going after that person.

02:46:24.616 --> 02:46:25.577
[SPEAKER_04]: The hell with the rest of you.

02:46:25.997 --> 02:46:28.078
[SPEAKER_04]: Although, I almost got killed by a little kid.

02:46:28.218 --> 02:46:30.980
[SPEAKER_04]: I think a little four-year-old threatened to cut me at Stockton Golf Line.

02:46:31.000 --> 02:46:33.622
[SPEAKER_04]: When I got up there and said, I'm playing.

02:46:34.183 --> 02:46:35.624
[SPEAKER_04]: Because this person put their token up.

02:46:35.644 --> 02:46:37.285
[SPEAKER_16]: She started talking about, No, it's mine.

02:46:37.405 --> 02:46:37.725
[SPEAKER_16]: It's mine.

02:46:37.745 --> 02:46:38.506
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going to cut you.

02:46:38.606 --> 02:46:40.227
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going to kill you in the face.

02:46:40.547 --> 02:46:42.288
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going to put my mommy on you.

02:46:42.608 --> 02:46:43.349
[SPEAKER_04]: Where is your mother?

02:46:43.409 --> 02:46:45.631
[SPEAKER_04]: Your mother just left you here for me to babysit you.

02:46:45.671 --> 02:46:46.051
[SPEAKER_04]: Go away.

02:46:54.370 --> 02:46:57.172
[SPEAKER_01]: Join us every Sunday night from 7 p.m.

02:46:57.312 --> 02:46:58.272
[SPEAKER_01]: until 9 p.m.

02:46:58.352 --> 02:47:08.239
[SPEAKER_01]: Pacific Standard Time for the Orange Lounge with your hosts, DarkSakura and Sky, where we'll talk about all things Bomani and then some.

02:47:08.679 --> 02:47:12.141
[SPEAKER_01]: In the meantime, enjoy our Bomani Music and More program.

02:47:12.978 --> 02:47:15.740
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know what the hell these things are that we're playing as we're coming back from break.

02:47:15.760 --> 02:47:18.062
[SPEAKER_22]: Those are the old promos we used to have that have little clips.

02:47:18.563 --> 02:47:22.226
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a good way to hear what we used to talk about on old shows.

02:47:22.606 --> 02:47:25.509
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that was like the second episode of Orange Lounge that clip came from.

02:47:25.869 --> 02:47:26.850
[SPEAKER_14]: I was actually not here.

02:47:27.090 --> 02:47:29.573
[SPEAKER_04]: You weren't here for the first couple episodes.

02:47:30.393 --> 02:47:32.075
[SPEAKER_14]: That was when I was in the gay dorm room.

02:47:32.972 --> 02:47:34.114
[SPEAKER_14]: The Gay Fraternity

02:47:44.608 --> 02:47:45.649
[SPEAKER_06]: And then look at his pupils.

02:47:45.709 --> 02:47:46.729
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, do you have the microphone?

02:47:47.069 --> 02:47:48.570
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you hand Loki the microphone, Christopher?

02:47:48.991 --> 02:47:49.631
[SPEAKER_06]: Make sure it's on there.

02:47:50.171 --> 02:47:50.732
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you feeling?

02:47:50.872 --> 02:47:52.973
[SPEAKER_04]: You threw up again during that break.

02:47:53.073 --> 02:47:59.477
[SPEAKER_24]: I feel... Yeah, I threw up quite a bit that break just because I didn't feel good.

02:47:59.657 --> 02:48:04.560
[SPEAKER_24]: Just probably because I had a lot of, like, you know, a lot of acid beforehand.

02:48:05.340 --> 02:48:09.202
[SPEAKER_23]: I was eating a... He was taking acid beforehand.

02:48:09.823 --> 02:48:13.565
[SPEAKER_23]: And so that's, you know, a lot of tomato soup and that's very acidy, so...

02:48:14.400 --> 02:48:18.485
[SPEAKER_14]: I actually only throw up when I have citrus mixture, so that does make sense.

02:48:19.626 --> 02:48:22.630
[SPEAKER_24]: I just feel really wasted right now.

02:48:22.690 --> 02:48:26.475
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm very tired and not very good.

02:48:26.495 --> 02:48:33.003
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, just, I'm completely out of it, so it's not even funny.

02:48:34.528 --> 02:48:35.748
[SPEAKER_24]: Just out of it.

02:48:36.008 --> 02:48:36.389
Okay.

02:48:36.749 --> 02:48:40.910
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, you can participate as you want to in this next segment.

02:48:41.070 --> 02:48:43.331
[SPEAKER_04]: I will participate as best as I can.

02:48:43.351 --> 02:48:50.633
[SPEAKER_04]: But we figure since our listeners have been so good and putting up with the last hour of this show, which has been kind of crappy.

02:48:52.133 --> 02:48:54.894
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, I completely understand.

02:48:54.954 --> 02:48:58.535
[SPEAKER_04]: This part, actually, some of them are getting kicked out of it, so whatever.

02:48:58.575 --> 02:48:59.836
[SPEAKER_04]: We only do this once in a while for you.

02:49:01.400 --> 02:49:02.561
[SPEAKER_04]: This part of the show is for you.

02:49:02.601 --> 02:49:07.985
[SPEAKER_04]: This is your chance to take the show in any direction you want to by asking Orange Lounge.

02:49:13.650 --> 02:49:16.552
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.

02:49:17.072 --> 02:49:20.335
[SPEAKER_04]: What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?

02:49:20.715 --> 02:49:24.098
[SPEAKER_04]: Will Nellie keep taunting me while I am drunk?

02:49:24.538 --> 02:49:27.781
[SPEAKER_04]: Or will she continue to dance a jig while her boyfriend pukes?

02:49:31.738 --> 02:49:33.940
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't you be talking crap about me.

02:49:33.960 --> 02:49:37.643
[SPEAKER_14]: Rob, that's actually the best opening song you have ever done.

02:49:37.883 --> 02:49:39.885
[SPEAKER_04]: And to think I had to be drunk to improvise that.

02:49:40.365 --> 02:49:43.327
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't believe that I was actually singing in technical public.

02:49:44.508 --> 02:49:46.330
[SPEAKER_14]: Because you know how afraid I am of singing.

02:49:46.903 --> 02:49:54.824
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, if I just breathe in and out very deeply, I can probably become coherent enough to actually answer questions or anything.

02:49:54.844 --> 02:49:58.585
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, this first one's directed towards the one and only DarkSakura, actually.

02:49:58.645 --> 02:49:59.445
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank God for that.

02:49:59.505 --> 02:50:02.146
[SPEAKER_04]: The question comes from DeepThought42.

02:50:02.866 --> 02:50:06.226
[SPEAKER_06]: And now, Deep Thoughts with Jack Handy.

02:50:06.286 --> 02:50:06.747
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, here it is.

02:50:07.007 --> 02:50:07.767
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, are you ready?

02:50:07.947 --> 02:50:10.507
[SPEAKER_14]: We used to go to the cave to see our Uncle Bear.

02:50:11.007 --> 02:50:14.968
[SPEAKER_14]: We called him Uncle Bear because he lived in the cave, and sometimes he'd eat one of us.

02:50:15.686 --> 02:50:17.627
[SPEAKER_14]: Later on, we found out he actually was a bear.

02:50:19.689 --> 02:50:26.873
[SPEAKER_04]: They say that every time a... The face of a child can say it all, especially the mouth part.

02:50:26.913 --> 02:50:30.675
[SPEAKER_06]: They say that every time a bell rings, an angel gets its wings.

02:50:31.076 --> 02:50:35.478
[SPEAKER_06]: But what they don't tell you is, every time a mousetrap snaps, an angel gets set on fire.

02:50:37.099 --> 02:50:37.359
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

02:50:37.520 --> 02:50:38.400
[SPEAKER_04]: I love Deep Thoughts.

02:50:40.121 --> 02:50:44.544
[SPEAKER_04]: Deep Thought 42, you were saying something earlier about how when you're drinking, you become a big cuddle whore.

02:50:45.821 --> 02:50:48.324
[SPEAKER_04]: DeepThought42 wants to know, will Jamie cuddle with me?

02:50:49.705 --> 02:50:51.267
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd have to ask my fiancé.

02:50:52.188 --> 02:50:55.871
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would imagine that DarkSakura has the following requirements.

02:50:56.211 --> 02:50:57.753
[SPEAKER_04]: First of all, you need to have good hygiene.

02:50:57.793 --> 02:50:59.635
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if you have VO, she's not going to cuddle with you.

02:50:59.935 --> 02:51:00.135
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

02:51:00.516 --> 02:51:02.417
[SPEAKER_04]: And second of all...

02:51:03.430 --> 02:51:06.792
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to not be an idiot, because DarkSakura doesn't cuddle with idiots.

02:51:06.912 --> 02:51:07.933
[SPEAKER_14]: And you have to have good grammar.

02:51:08.193 --> 02:51:11.415
[SPEAKER_04]: You are listening to Orange Launch Radio, which is some plus points there.

02:51:11.475 --> 02:51:13.316
[SPEAKER_14]: That proves that you're not a complete idiot.

02:51:13.396 --> 02:51:14.116
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, very good.

02:51:14.156 --> 02:51:19.819
[SPEAKER_14]: But you have to have excellent grammar and great enunciation skills.

02:51:20.380 --> 02:51:20.680
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

02:51:22.141 --> 02:51:23.321
[SPEAKER_04]: Are those like your turn-ons?

02:51:24.582 --> 02:51:27.083
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh my god, grammar makes me so fucking horny!

02:51:29.365 --> 02:51:31.506
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, now I know what clip I'm going to use in the next intro.

02:51:33.482 --> 02:51:40.786
[SPEAKER_13]: And now... And now... And now he just said that monkeys make her horny.

02:51:41.586 --> 02:51:44.367
[SPEAKER_26]: Call 1-900-DARK-SAKURA.

02:51:44.447 --> 02:51:44.868
[SPEAKER_13]: Shut up.

02:51:44.908 --> 02:51:47.049
[SPEAKER_26]: Her turn-ons are good grammar.

02:51:48.409 --> 02:51:50.070
[SPEAKER_26]: And guys that... And Xanadu.

02:51:50.350 --> 02:51:51.691
[SPEAKER_26]: Guys that have good hygiene.

02:51:52.791 --> 02:51:56.234
[SPEAKER_14]: My turn-ons are Electric Light Orchestra and Good Grammar.

02:51:56.254 --> 02:52:00.618
[SPEAKER_04]: I get off on Sesame Street, yo.

02:52:01.919 --> 02:52:02.880
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki passed out.

02:52:04.601 --> 02:52:07.984
[SPEAKER_04]: Please stop with the talking about what turn-ons are.

02:52:08.004 --> 02:52:10.446
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, as soon as he stops using the letter U instead of Y-O-U.

02:52:10.466 --> 02:52:10.666
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, um...

02:52:18.493 --> 02:52:19.654
[SPEAKER_04]: Ron Chan has a question.

02:52:19.794 --> 02:52:23.856
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to get this alcohol out of my system ASAP.

02:52:23.896 --> 02:52:26.178
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to be saving your energy for the podcast.

02:52:27.038 --> 02:52:27.899
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, whatever.

02:52:27.939 --> 02:52:28.939
[SPEAKER_04]: Ron Chan has a question.

02:52:29.340 --> 02:52:30.320
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's my question.

02:52:30.360 --> 02:52:32.902
[SPEAKER_04]: You said on the podcast that Bomberman DS was $20.

02:52:33.963 --> 02:52:35.183
[SPEAKER_04]: Where the hell did you find it for $20?

02:52:35.243 --> 02:52:37.545
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I sure as hell couldn't.

02:52:37.565 --> 02:52:40.146
[SPEAKER_04]: That was actually Miklatov that ended up buying that for $20.

02:52:40.226 --> 02:52:47.411
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know where he bought it, but knowing him, it was probably EB Games or GameStop, one of the two, because he used to work for EB Games before he was at Konami.

02:52:48.091 --> 02:52:50.634
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, who else sells?

02:52:50.774 --> 02:52:51.394
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, you know what?

02:52:51.454 --> 02:52:54.797
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw a good deal on Meteos at Target, of all places.

02:52:54.897 --> 02:52:58.400
[SPEAKER_04]: They only wanted $29.99 as opposed to $39.99 for it, so that was good.

02:52:59.001 --> 02:53:00.862
[SPEAKER_04]: So, shop around.

02:53:00.943 --> 02:53:05.046
[SPEAKER_04]: Check Frugal as a part of Google, if nothing else, and you'll find a good deal there.

02:53:05.386 --> 02:53:11.211
[SPEAKER_04]: From what I understand, though, and you're probably a little late for this, but Circuit City apparently had a really good deal on video games today.

02:53:11.992 --> 02:53:18.154
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, they were selling $10 video games today, like Amplitude, and what's that GameCube role-playing game, Bighton Kaitos or whatever?

02:53:18.634 --> 02:53:20.155
[SPEAKER_04]: Those were all like $10 today.

02:53:20.295 --> 02:53:20.915
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty cool, huh?

02:53:22.916 --> 02:53:23.176
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

02:53:26.097 --> 02:53:29.818
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, DeepThought42 wants you to know that his father is an English professor.

02:53:30.498 --> 02:53:31.119
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, English.

02:53:31.459 --> 02:53:31.799
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm drunk.

02:53:32.519 --> 02:53:34.080
[SPEAKER_04]: His father is an English professor.

02:53:35.260 --> 02:53:36.601
[SPEAKER_14]: That's awfully tempting.

02:53:36.621 --> 02:53:37.441
[SPEAKER_14]: That's pretty hot.

02:53:37.541 --> 02:53:40.262
[SPEAKER_14]: However, I am highly taken.

02:53:41.042 --> 02:53:42.683
[SPEAKER_14]: My fiance is excellent.

02:53:42.763 --> 02:53:44.284
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a cuddle.

02:53:44.745 --> 02:53:45.505
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a cuddle.

02:53:46.066 --> 02:53:47.086
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not making out.

02:53:47.147 --> 02:53:47.887
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not sex.

02:53:47.987 --> 02:53:48.287
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:53:49.248 --> 02:53:59.255
[SPEAKER_04]: VidPowell wants to know, is the OLR crew doing anything worth mentioning on the 4th of July?

02:53:59.756 --> 02:54:01.457
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm eating me some meat!

02:54:01.777 --> 02:54:03.778
[SPEAKER_04]: We know Loki has to deal with his family tomorrow.

02:54:04.919 --> 02:54:06.100
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, my God.

02:54:06.120 --> 02:54:07.601
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry.

02:54:07.701 --> 02:54:08.362
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, my car.

02:54:08.722 --> 02:54:09.683
[SPEAKER_14]: Because my car is gone.

02:54:10.680 --> 02:54:12.962
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm so dizzy right now, it's so funny.

02:54:12.982 --> 02:54:14.783
[SPEAKER_24]: Are you going to barf because I need to go back to the bathroom?

02:54:14.823 --> 02:54:17.604
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm not going to throw up, no, I'm just really dizzy.

02:54:18.505 --> 02:54:22.407
[SPEAKER_24]: If I take, if my stomach is fine, I'll be fine.

02:54:23.928 --> 02:54:25.029
[SPEAKER_14]: You look kind of bloated.

02:54:26.990 --> 02:54:28.071
[SPEAKER_16]: Seriously!

02:54:28.631 --> 02:54:33.114
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, what is the first thing that alcohol does that makes you brutally honest with everybody?

02:54:33.914 --> 02:54:36.596
[SPEAKER_14]: Sort of like how, what was it Margaret Cho said about grappa?

02:54:37.617 --> 02:54:38.597
[SPEAKER_14]: You have that skin!

02:54:40.129 --> 02:54:40.850
[SPEAKER_14]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

02:55:10.814 --> 02:55:13.295
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank God, because this show is really starting to go downhill fast.

02:55:13.715 --> 02:55:18.136
[SPEAKER_04]: So now we're going to go around and get everybody, and now we're going to try and tape a podcast.

02:55:18.176 --> 02:55:19.037
[SPEAKER_04]: That should be tons of fun.

02:55:19.557 --> 02:55:22.458
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we're going to go around and get everybody's final thought.

02:55:23.538 --> 02:55:26.539
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, why don't you start us off, because you're the most sober out of everybody.

02:55:26.559 --> 02:55:27.319
[SPEAKER_04]: What's your final thought?

02:55:27.779 --> 02:55:29.300
[SPEAKER_14]: Reject false icons.

02:55:31.260 --> 02:55:32.561
[SPEAKER_04]: Extaper, do you have a final thought?

02:55:32.961 --> 02:55:33.421
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't hide.

02:55:33.761 --> 02:55:35.262
[SPEAKER_04]: Come here, Extaper, do you have a final thought?

02:55:36.862 --> 02:55:39.203
[SPEAKER_04]: I am not drunk and I don't have a final thought.

02:55:39.323 --> 02:55:39.783
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

02:55:40.782 --> 02:55:41.142
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.

02:55:42.423 --> 02:55:43.404
[SPEAKER_04]: Nellie, what's your final thought?

02:55:44.745 --> 02:55:46.246
[SPEAKER_09]: We are not coming back over here.

02:55:49.569 --> 02:55:53.112
[SPEAKER_04]: And my final thought is, remember kids, don't drink and drive.

02:55:53.973 --> 02:55:55.594
[SPEAKER_04]: And Loki, your final thought?

02:55:56.635 --> 02:55:57.936
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want any more alcohol.

02:55:58.717 --> 02:55:58.977
[SPEAKER_04]: Ever?

02:55:58.997 --> 02:56:01.719
[SPEAKER_04]: At least this week.

02:56:01.959 --> 02:56:02.280
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:56:02.700 --> 02:56:03.461
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the spirit.

02:56:04.722 --> 02:56:05.042
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:56:05.939 --> 02:56:14.136
[SPEAKER_04]: The final word of the show One word to sum it all up Thank you guys for listening by the way And big hugs and kisses And if this was your first show tonight Seriously guys

02:56:15.236 --> 02:56:17.118
[SPEAKER_04]: This isn't what it's normally like.

02:56:17.158 --> 02:56:18.839
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry to see your first show.

02:56:19.480 --> 02:56:22.242
[SPEAKER_04]: We normally are not drunken louts on the show.

02:56:22.302 --> 02:56:28.407
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't even think that because of the iTunes thing, we'd have way more listeners this week, meaning we'd have way more people who are listening to the show the first time.

02:56:29.087 --> 02:56:31.710
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoops, that was a bad calculation on when to do a drunk show.

02:56:32.410 --> 02:56:32.790
[SPEAKER_04]: My bad.

02:56:32.831 --> 02:56:39.416
[SPEAKER_14]: We did the drunk show because, first of all, it is our three-year anniversary, plus it is also a three-day weekend.

02:56:39.456 --> 02:56:40.797
[SPEAKER_14]: We were taking advantage of it.

02:56:41.338 --> 02:56:43.980
[SPEAKER_14]: Every three-day weekend that comes up, we usually get pissed.

02:56:45.219 --> 02:56:47.280
[SPEAKER_14]: So, again, tune in next week.

02:56:47.320 --> 02:56:48.360
[SPEAKER_14]: Give us one more chance.

02:56:48.560 --> 02:56:50.200
[SPEAKER_14]: I swear we will be sober.

02:56:50.700 --> 02:56:55.342
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki will probably be highly embarrassed because his family's been listening to him drunk on the show.

02:56:56.382 --> 02:57:00.443
[SPEAKER_14]: And we'll be full of our usual, you know, piss and angst next week.

02:57:02.744 --> 02:57:04.324
[SPEAKER_04]: Really quick last minute questions.

02:57:04.824 --> 02:57:06.565
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, just one from Dirty Thief.

02:57:06.745 --> 02:57:07.565
[SPEAKER_04]: See, another new name.

02:57:07.625 --> 02:57:08.385
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't recognize his name.

02:57:08.885 --> 02:57:11.606
[SPEAKER_04]: Can Loki share with us his family reactions on the next show?

02:57:13.433 --> 02:57:14.854
[SPEAKER_04]: Nelly says she'll do it, if nothing else.

02:57:15.935 --> 02:57:17.237
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki's reaching for the microphone.

02:57:18.298 --> 02:57:27.306
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, my reaction is probably to my family is going to be, they'll be, like, surprised that I'm drunk on this show, but they'll probably understand this is a three-day weekend.

02:57:27.507 --> 02:57:28.768
[SPEAKER_23]: It's just a radio show.

02:57:28.788 --> 02:57:33.052
[SPEAKER_23]: Other than that, you know, they'll just be like, I can't believe we heard you're drunk.

02:57:34.173 --> 02:57:35.834
[SPEAKER_14]: He's going to sleep so well tonight.

02:57:35.914 --> 02:57:39.916
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm just really tired right now and I don't feel so good.

02:57:41.137 --> 02:57:47.621
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm just going to try to deal with this alcohol as best I can without making a mess of the apartment.

02:57:49.342 --> 02:57:50.683
[SPEAKER_04]: Final word of the show.

02:57:51.443 --> 02:57:53.144
[SPEAKER_04]: One word to sum it all up.

02:57:53.944 --> 02:57:57.547
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, pick that microphone back up and give us one word that sums it all up.

02:57:57.567 --> 02:57:58.227
[SPEAKER_04]: See you next week, everybody.

02:57:59.844 --> 02:58:02.486
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't drink and drive, it's really bad.

02:58:02.506 --> 02:58:03.107
[SPEAKER_04]: One word!

02:58:03.347 --> 02:58:03.748
[SPEAKER_04]: One word!

02:58:03.768 --> 02:58:04.248
[SPEAKER_04]: One word!

02:58:04.969 --> 02:58:06.150
Drunk!

02:58:06.990 --> 02:58:11.895

[SPEAKER_18]: Auto-destruct sequence in 5, 4, 3, 2... Whoops!

02:58:45.698 --> 02:58:46.658
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not the right track.

02:58:46.838 --> 02:58:47.219
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on.

02:58:48.019 --> 02:58:48.500
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm drunk.

02:58:48.540 --> 02:58:49.220
[SPEAKER_04]: What can I say?

02:58:49.340 --> 02:58:49.741
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on.

02:58:50.681 --> 02:58:51.162
[SPEAKER_04]: Here it is.

02:58:51.242 --> 02:58:52.402
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll do this track instead.

02:58:52.543 --> 02:58:53.063
[SPEAKER_04]: Try this one.
