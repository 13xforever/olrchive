But you can't see.

00:27.840 --> 00:31.840
Yeah, that was a great radio joke.

00:31.840 --> 00:35.840
Yes, plenty of great radio jokes to come tonight. Also,

00:35.840 --> 00:39.840

00:39.840 --> 00:43.840
And I spent 40 bucks on liquor. And DarkStakra doesn't even know what I bought yet,

00:43.840 --> 00:47.840
but I assure you I got at least one of her favorites. So we've got all that

00:47.840 --> 00:51.840

In this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm is Dark Sakura. Jamie Summers?

03:31.900 --> 03:45.900
You have to remember my roommate, the extra fur? Huge Buffy fan. Have you ever walked into his room and looked through the DVD collections?

03:45.900 --> 03:46.900
I've seen them from across the hall.

03:46.900 --> 03:51.900
It's just a whole shelf of Buffy and Angel.

03:51.900 --> 03:55.900
I am of the happy for the show, but of the angst for other reasons.

03:55.900 --> 03:56.900
What a waste of money.

03:56.900 --> 03:59.900
Damn you, Hot Topic. Damn you!

03:59.900 --> 04:03.540
We'll be getting into that a little while. We all have a lot of angst to say. I don't know about Loki.

04:03.540 --> 04:06.820
I know I've got big angst to say. But I have a refrigerator now!

04:06.820 --> 04:10.700
That's good. Refrigerators are good. Cold things are good. And the washer and dryer. I have some

04:10.700 --> 04:14.540
surprises in the refrigerator right now. I've never been so excited to be able to do my

04:14.540 --> 04:16.580
own laundry in a long time.

04:16.580 --> 04:18.820
Would it be the fish tasty nice?

04:18.820 --> 04:23.580
No, it's not the fish tasty nice. Shut your mouth.

04:23.580 --> 04:27.080
You just... I don't know. Forget it. Anyway, in the other corner,

04:27.080 --> 04:31.240

I got forty dollars worth of liquor tonight, so I'm gonna go get it, so somebody's gotta

04:59.120 --> 05:00.300
fill time during this intro.

05:00.300 --> 05:01.620
Tell the kids what they have to look forward to.

05:01.620 --> 05:02.620
I had ice cream?

05:02.620 --> 05:04.340
Cause I'm cheating like hell today.

05:04.340 --> 05:09.020
I am having so much liquor that I'm probably gonna end up in the hospital with blood poisoning,

05:09.020 --> 05:12.140
as in, you know, too much blood on my alcohol level.

05:12.140 --> 05:16.660
See, Rod had something rotten in his freezer, so all of his ice tastes really fucking nasty,

05:16.660 --> 05:20.060
so all my drinks are, like, not cold.

05:20.060 --> 05:21.060
And that...

05:21.060 --> 05:22.060
And so fish.

05:22.060 --> 05:23.060
Exactly.

05:23.060 --> 05:25.060
I was like, I smelled, I sniffed in their eye.

05:25.060 --> 05:27.060
Ugh, what is that?

05:27.060 --> 05:29.060
Like, I don't know, man.

05:29.060 --> 05:33.060
I mean, even when our nasty freezer didn't smell that bad, but...

05:33.060 --> 05:38.060
I can't really get too shitfaced tonight because I'm gonna go drinkin' at the club too.

05:38.060 --> 05:40.060
Ahh!

05:40.060 --> 05:44.060
You also got me pineapple and Malibu, but I have Guinness.

05:44.060 --> 05:46.060
And no bottle opener!

05:46.060 --> 05:48.060
I got Guinness, I'll get something.

05:48.060 --> 05:55.800
Guinness, Peppermint Schnapps, Malibu Pineapple Rum, and there's also a Smirnoff Mandarin Orange.

05:55.800 --> 05:58.260
Do you have any normal Malibu?

05:58.260 --> 06:00.060
I don't think there's any left.

06:00.060 --> 06:02.640
I hate to say it.

06:02.640 --> 06:03.640
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

06:03.640 --> 06:04.640
It is on sale!

06:04.640 --> 06:05.640

06:05.640 --> 06:06.640
Oh.

06:06.640 --> 06:09.800
Is that the same bottle of Bacardi that's been sitting there for like weeks now?

06:09.800 --> 06:11.180
Probably I don't know.

06:11.180 --> 06:12.180
Guinness!

06:12.180 --> 06:13.520
Go fetch!

06:13.520 --> 06:15.500

06:15.500 --> 06:22.500
Licker, liquor, liquor, I wanna drink my goodness. Screw the show, gimme three!

06:22.500 --> 06:27.500
We will be back after this break, cause I gotta go, what is wrong with that mic?

06:27.500 --> 06:28.500
Ah!

06:28.500 --> 06:30.500
It's not drunk yet. Needs more alcohol.

06:30.500 --> 06:31.500
I want to be dunked.

06:31.500 --> 06:37.500
Okay, we will work on that. And of course our alcohol show disclaimer when we come back after this.

06:37.500 --> 06:40.500
We're not responsible for anything we say or do.

06:40.500 --> 06:41.500
Or stuff.

06:41.500 --> 06:42.500
Or who we kill.

06:42.500 --> 06:47.500
In this break, some music that was popular when Orange Lounge Radio first started.

06:47.500 --> 06:50.500
You remember what game was really big when Orange Lounge Radio first started?

06:50.500 --> 06:51.500
DDR!

06:51.500 --> 06:55.500
Max 2? DDR Max 2. DDR was actually still popular.

06:55.500 --> 06:58.500
DDR Max 2. He made it funny.

06:58.500 --> 07:00.500
I know.

07:00.500 --> 07:02.500
How far listeners aren't going to get it? They're like, DDR's still cool.

07:02.500 --> 07:07.500
DDR Max 2. And remember we were trying to unlock music and all that stuff?

07:07.500 --> 07:09.500
Oh, good times. Good times.

07:09.500 --> 07:13.500
Wasn't that also deep in the middle of playing Lots of Space Channel 5?

07:13.500 --> 07:15.500
At that point you probably were.

07:15.500 --> 07:18.500
Up, down, up, down, two, two, two.

07:18.500 --> 07:22.500
In this break we're going to play some music from Max 2.

07:22.500 --> 07:24.500
We'll start it off with Busta.

07:24.500 --> 07:26.500
I will go find something to open that with.

07:26.500 --> 07:29.500
Isn't it twisty off?

07:29.500 --> 07:31.500
We'll be back.

07:31.500 --> 07:32.500
Not twisty off.

07:32.500 --> 07:34.500
We'll be back after this.

07:34.500 --> 07:36.500
With more whining courtesy of Dark Sakura.

07:36.500 --> 07:38.500
Oh

08:06.500 --> 08:15.500
My love, I want you to be my man

08:15.500 --> 08:17.500
Step, have a living cool master scream

08:17.500 --> 08:20.500
If you wanna go faster, taking a train to the next station

08:20.500 --> 08:22.500
On the dance floor, rocking the nation

08:22.500 --> 08:24.500
The sound, it's coming out now

08:24.500 --> 08:26.500
The day change, play your song loud

08:26.500 --> 08:28.500
Dancing, make your body rock

08:28.500 --> 08:30.500
Long train running and it won't stop

08:30.500 --> 08:32.500
Like a bista, I keep on churning

08:32.500 --> 08:34.500
Like a fire, I keep on burning

08:34.500 --> 08:36.500
Hands around in a place

08:36.500 --> 08:38.500
With every change they write a page

08:38.500 --> 08:40.000
This is the beginning

08:40.000 --> 08:41.500
That we're going round and round

08:41.500 --> 08:43.500
And the silver is going to go in the heart

08:43.500 --> 08:45.500
Of the battle that comes next

08:45.500 --> 08:47.000
We're going to help

08:47.000 --> 08:48.500
We're going to be the last

08:48.500 --> 08:50.500
We're going to be here right now

08:50.500 --> 08:52.500
We're going to be in my house

08:52.500 --> 08:57.500
We're going to love

08:57.500 --> 08:59.500
And here we go

08:59.500 --> 09:01.500

It is rising, the money's getting low According to our soft saying, the street's the place to go

12:56.500 --> 13:00.500
Just a night for the first time

13:00.500 --> 13:03.500
Just about half past ten

13:03.500 --> 13:07.500
For the first time in history

13:07.500 --> 13:11.500
Gotta start prayin' then

13:11.500 --> 13:13.500
It's prayin' then

13:13.500 --> 13:17.500
Hallelujah, it's prayin' then

Please feel free to join us on June 23rd at 7 p.m. for our first show of the Orange

14:02.100 --> 14:06.780
Lounge, the new Baylani Community Talk Show.

14:06.780 --> 14:07.780
If you're not there, we'll hunt you down.

14:07.780 --> 14:08.780
We know where you live.

14:08.780 --> 14:09.780
We have your numbers.

14:09.780 --> 14:11.780
We looked it up on the internet.

14:11.780 --> 14:12.780
Hello.

14:12.780 --> 14:13.780
We're back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

14:13.780 --> 14:14.780
A little bit of retro there.

14:14.780 --> 14:18.080
That was one of the first commercials for Orange Lounge Radio we ran on here.

14:18.080 --> 14:20.420
We are having a catastrophe here in studio.

14:20.420 --> 14:23.380
This is horrible.

14:23.380 --> 14:29.060
Nowhere in this apartment was there a bottle opener anywhere.

14:29.060 --> 14:30.780
Is there screaming coming from the kitchen?

14:30.780 --> 14:32.940
No, but Jamie split a nail.

14:32.940 --> 14:39.420
Jamie split a nail trying to open a bottle of Guinness with a knife while I'm running

14:39.420 --> 14:43.660
around the house trying to find a lighter that I remember once having that had a bottle

14:43.660 --> 14:45.120
opener on the end of it.

14:45.120 --> 14:49.580
And this is the first time that I'm going to regret quitting smoking because if I was

14:49.580 --> 14:55.480
still smoking I'd probably still have that lighter on me oh well how you

14:55.480 --> 15:00.680
feeling now that you finally finally by the way Nellie Loki's fiancee ran

15:00.680 --> 15:04.760
downstairs and picked up a bottle opener from the neighbors which would have been

15:04.760 --> 15:09.160
the smart thing to do in the first place so anyway so Dark Sakura has a Guinness

15:09.160 --> 15:14.640
Loki's on the second screwdriver I still double screwdriver I still have

15:14.640 --> 15:17.720
not drank in anything so I've got to go get that Guinness that you opened up for

15:17.720 --> 15:26.720
so I'll be back you guys still time I like Guinness the whole bunch yep I do

15:26.720 --> 15:38.200
why it better than that camel piss they sell you know cores or whatever dark you

15:38.200 --> 15:40.320
YOU CAN EAT IT WITH A SPOON!

15:40.320 --> 15:41.320
Ew.

15:41.320 --> 15:43.320
Goodness, this is yummy stuff.

15:43.320 --> 15:44.320
No.

15:44.320 --> 15:45.320
Um.

15:45.320 --> 15:46.320
Yeah.

15:46.320 --> 15:47.320
Um.

15:47.320 --> 15:49.880
It's been really hot.

15:49.880 --> 15:51.920
Shit, yeah.

15:51.920 --> 15:52.920
What?

15:52.920 --> 15:53.920
Okay.

15:53.920 --> 16:02.880
This is really funny because Xtopher, my roommate, had a crush on the neighbors downstairs.

16:02.880 --> 16:08.120
So he had to go downstairs and take the bottle opener back and it's just really funny.

16:08.120 --> 16:10.720
I'm giggling, because it's the first time they've met, so.

16:10.720 --> 16:11.220
Aw.

16:14.000 --> 16:17.120
I expect Barbara Streisand music to start playing in the background.

16:17.120 --> 16:17.780
Yeah, it's cute.

16:17.780 --> 16:19.200
Anyway, I have Guinness, so.

16:19.200 --> 16:21.680
I've been listening to show tunes in my car.

16:21.680 --> 16:26.080
I got the Spam-A-Lot CD, the Money Python Broadway play.

16:29.040 --> 16:29.540
Uh-huh.

16:29.540 --> 16:31.420
You're staring at your bottle in winter.

16:31.420 --> 16:33.460
It's like I was drinking and nothing was coming out,

16:33.460 --> 16:34.420
but it's still foaming.

16:34.420 --> 16:34.920
That's why.

16:34.920 --> 16:36.380
Look, it's going to foam over.

16:36.380 --> 16:36.880
Anyway.

16:36.880 --> 16:40.880
Flaming is not good on Guinness. You need to pour it in such a way that it doesn't foam.

16:40.880 --> 16:43.880
I'm going to pour it in my mouth pretty soon.

16:43.880 --> 16:45.880
Where's the webcam? It better not be pointing at me.

16:45.880 --> 16:46.880
No, it's pointing at me, actually.

16:46.880 --> 16:47.880
Look, Boost.

16:47.880 --> 16:50.880
Here, I can hold it again. Oh shit, my Guinness is going to spill over.

16:50.880 --> 16:55.880
Tonight, by the way, if you're looking for a quality show...

16:55.880 --> 16:58.880
Excuse me.

16:58.880 --> 17:02.880
Our show is as good as those fireworks out there.

17:02.880 --> 17:07.380
It started off great, but it kind of degrades after, you know, over time.

17:07.380 --> 17:09.880
We'll open up the Skype line so you can give your congratulations to us.

17:09.880 --> 17:11.380
We just want it down for your safety.

17:11.380 --> 17:12.880
Run down!

17:15.880 --> 17:17.880
Alright, good luck getting the next one open.

17:17.880 --> 17:19.880
That's because I already opened it. Aha!

17:19.880 --> 17:22.880
I told you the one that was already open. I hope you open three.

17:22.880 --> 17:24.880
Okay.

17:24.880 --> 17:26.880
Oh, they gave us the bottle opener. It doesn't matter.

17:26.880 --> 17:28.880
Yeah, no, the neighbors downstairs gave it to us.

17:28.880 --> 17:29.880
They took it back.

17:29.880 --> 17:30.380
Oh.

17:30.380 --> 17:30.880
Yeah.

17:30.880 --> 17:31.880
They took it back.

17:31.880 --> 17:33.880
And they said no keep it

17:36.200 --> 17:41.840
It's all excited. All right. Anyway, how was your week? How was your day? We'll start off the show with the classic

17:41.840 --> 17:45.760
We weren't here last week. So yeah, we've got two weeks to catch up on what they do last week

17:45.760 --> 17:48.160
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry. We have to do the drunk disclaimer. I'm sorry

17:48.160 --> 17:52.600
We have to start the show the drunk disclaimer boys and girls on myself Loki and dark Sakura all

17:53.320 --> 17:54.800
Indulging in a little bit of liquor tonight

17:54.800 --> 17:58.980
But please if you are going to drink drink responsibly which we will be doing for the most part

17:58.980 --> 18:02.880
and have a designated driver. We do have several designated drivers tonight.

18:02.880 --> 18:07.080
Xtaphir is remaining sober. He will be chauffeuring DarkSakura and I to the club later on,

18:07.080 --> 18:10.480
and Loki's significant other Nellie is remaining sober as well.

18:10.480 --> 18:15.680
So please, kids, don't drink and drive. And if you do decide to start drinking because of us,

18:15.680 --> 18:19.280
please don't tell your parents it was because of us, because the last thing we need is a lawsuit.

18:19.280 --> 18:23.280
Blame it on Grand Theft Auto. Yes, blame it on Grand Theft Auto. They'll believe that.

18:23.280 --> 18:26.680
Exactly. Alright, how was your week? How was your day? Um, what was it? My week?

18:26.680 --> 18:35.680
What did I do last week? I think I went down and met the Rabbi, I believe that was last week, and we went down to San Francisco and that kind of sucked.

18:35.680 --> 18:46.680
Yeah, that's what we did last Sunday. So we did that and that was kind of boring because, you know, San Francisco sucks and it was kind of cold and we went to the Cheesecake Factory and they have lean pizza there.

18:46.680 --> 18:51.680
But I guess, you know, they would probably, you know, specialize in cheesecake and not pizza.

18:51.680 --> 18:59.680
And then, um, let's see, what else? Oh, I picked up the game, or not God of War, um, Destroy All Humans, and that was a lot of fun.

18:59.680 --> 19:02.680
And, um, I actually beat that game today.

19:02.680 --> 19:12.680
And, um, what else? Oh, I got another PSP as a spiff from my work, so now I have two PSPs.

19:12.680 --> 19:19.680
And, um, I'm playing this game Dead to Rights Reckoning right now, which is okay.

19:19.680 --> 19:23.680
And, uh, no DDR at all.

19:23.680 --> 19:30.680
Because, um, I have no computer to play it on my cabinet, because my sister is borrowing my cabinet computer, and that sucks.

19:30.680 --> 19:31.680
Why?

19:31.680 --> 19:33.680
Because she needs a computer for school.

19:33.680 --> 19:38.680
And I tried building her one of the really shitty parts I had, and it didn't work, so...

19:38.680 --> 19:41.800
Alas, she had to borrow it.

19:41.800 --> 19:45.720
So my cabinet computer is gone for the summer.

19:45.720 --> 19:49.520
Oh well. It's not like you were using it anyway.

19:49.520 --> 19:53.360
No, I used it once. You built this huge main cabinet. It was a huge deal and you spent

19:53.360 --> 19:55.720
how much money on this main cabinet? About $3,000.

19:55.720 --> 19:59.440
Thousands of dollars on this cabinet. And then I think I saw you playing the

19:59.440 --> 20:00.960
Simpsons arcade game once.

20:00.960 --> 20:04.800
I used to play a lot more than that. It's just, you know,

20:04.800 --> 20:09.800
What it comes down to right now is just I haven't been able to work on it lately.

20:09.800 --> 20:14.800
Once I get more stuff in there like a BeatMania controller or something, it'll be a lot more fun.

20:14.800 --> 20:22.800
And I was playing DDR on it, but the problem is I'll have to still mod the pads to ground out the static on them,

20:22.800 --> 20:27.800
and then it'll work, and then I can play DDR and get in shape and the whole plan and everything.

20:27.800 --> 20:29.800
But right now it's just, you know...

20:29.800 --> 20:31.800
Are you gonna have a six-pack and all that stuff?

20:31.800 --> 20:32.800
Number three!

20:32.800 --> 20:36.880
Wait, how are you on number three already? You drank number one in front of us.

20:36.880 --> 20:41.160
Double shot of vodka. Well, in that case, I'm on number four.

20:41.160 --> 20:47.160
Double shots count as one beverage because it's in one glass.

20:47.160 --> 20:50.400
Okay, then where did number two go? I'm still on number one.

20:50.400 --> 20:53.920
I am on number three. Alright, anyway. Yeah, but where did number two go?

20:53.920 --> 20:57.520
I did a double shot of vodka. Oh, well then what's this

20:57.520 --> 21:01.080
you're drinking now? Sugar-free Cherry

21:01.080 --> 21:07.080
Joan soda, and a double shot of vodka.

21:07.080 --> 21:10.080
I can drink vodka straight, thank you.

21:10.080 --> 21:12.080
I'm sorry, uh, MAME CABINET.

21:12.080 --> 21:15.080
Anyways, yeah, so, MAME CAB and the computer are gone. For now.

21:15.080 --> 21:18.080
Because Mr. Strasser has to do homework.

21:18.080 --> 21:22.080
That's it. That's really all I did this week, is just playing Destroy All Humans.

21:22.080 --> 21:27.080
It's a lot of fun throwing people around using psychic abilities.

21:27.080 --> 21:29.080
Especially with the ragdoll physics in that game.

21:29.080 --> 21:36.080
It makes for a lot of fun. Like, you can pick up cows and smash them in the stuff and just people and it's a lot of fun. A lot of fun.

21:36.080 --> 21:43.080
And, um, so that's pretty much all I've been playing this week and, um, yeah. That's pretty much it.

21:43.080 --> 21:45.080
So, uh, you went and saw The War of the Worlds, right?

21:45.080 --> 21:46.080
Oh, yeah.

21:46.080 --> 21:47.080
How was that?

21:47.080 --> 21:48.080
That was good.

21:48.080 --> 21:50.080
I have no interest in seeing War of the Worlds.

21:50.080 --> 21:51.080
It was good.

21:51.080 --> 21:56.080
I know I've been hearing it's really good, but I'm like, uh, Tom Cruise is so 80s.

21:56.080 --> 21:58.080
Who cares about Tom Cruise? Tom Cruise isn't white.

21:58.080 --> 22:02.580
And I don't like Spielberg movies either. I really don't like the only Spielberg movie I ever liked.

22:02.580 --> 22:03.780
Terminator 2 was fucking awesome!

22:03.780 --> 22:05.780
That was not a Spielberg movie!

22:05.780 --> 22:07.780
Wasn't it? Yeah, well, no, that was Cameron.

22:07.780 --> 22:10.780
Steven Spielberg presents Terminator 2.

22:10.780 --> 22:12.780
I don't think he'd give Cameron, because he's awesome.

22:16.780 --> 22:20.780
T-Term-Termie, can you-can you help me save the world?

22:21.780 --> 22:22.280
Yes.

22:22.280 --> 22:23.780
I just do a don't B.R.I.

22:23.780 --> 22:32.780
Hey, Terminator, phone home. I'll be back. I don't really want to hurt humans. I just have to because I'm programmed this way.

22:32.780 --> 22:36.780
Do you think that the Star Wars movies would have been better if Spielberg had a hand in them?

22:36.780 --> 22:42.780
No, they couldn't have. Yes, because anything is better than Lucas. Although, Episode III was pretty cool. I'll give him that.

22:42.780 --> 22:45.780
I saw George Lucas and I almost flicked Liz Adam.

22:45.780 --> 22:56.360
And first off, people, this is not, you know, this is not, this is not E.T. Spielberg.

22:56.360 --> 22:58.180
This is dual Spielberg.

22:58.180 --> 23:00.600
This is like dark Spielberg, okay?

23:00.600 --> 23:01.600
Like evil Spielberg.

23:01.600 --> 23:05.600
Anyways, so, um, do you know who I am?

23:05.600 --> 23:08.680
Do you have a tray?

23:08.680 --> 23:09.680
This is not a game.

23:09.680 --> 23:12.920
Who the fuck are you?

23:12.920 --> 23:16.440
i didn't even get back to you

23:16.440 --> 23:20.760
anyway if you're going to be a good friend i highly recommend going to see

23:20.760 --> 23:24.640
this movie i want to see it again it was really good at the movie that will stick

23:24.640 --> 23:27.160
with you it's just like you know i wow

23:27.160 --> 23:30.740
you know it's one of those you know like gum that got on my friend john shew the

23:30.740 --> 23:35.880
other day okay and a great go into this movie knowing it's gonna and book like

23:35.880 --> 23:39.160
the original it's not going to be this for the spoilers

23:39.160 --> 23:42.720
oh come on it's a goddamn movie you know how it ends

23:42.720 --> 23:47.480
i mean come on everyone knows how it ends but it's good okay that's all you need to know

23:47.480 --> 23:49.800
and um...

23:49.800 --> 23:52.920
the only gripe about it is the aliens

23:52.920 --> 23:54.080
were a little too cute

23:54.080 --> 23:55.240
and a little too dumb

23:55.240 --> 23:58.280
and and they died when you poured water on them what's up with that

23:58.280 --> 24:02.080
they didn't die when you poured water there's water in the atmosphere what the hell that makes no

24:02.080 --> 24:06.640
sense at all but they have like cute like faces it's the same thing about about the

24:06.640 --> 24:08.580
wicked witch of the west uh...

24:08.580 --> 24:11.920
How could she walk around fucking Oz

24:11.920 --> 24:15.840
when there's condensation in the air? How do we know that Oz was based around a

24:15.840 --> 24:17.240
carbon-based, you know...

24:17.240 --> 24:22.040
Because it was on fucking Earth that they could freakin' play a balloon to Kansas!

24:22.040 --> 24:25.520
And Batman begins... Well Oz is part of Hollywood, dammit!

24:25.520 --> 24:29.160
Batman begins, what the fuck? Our bodies are made of water. What the fuck was that?

24:29.160 --> 24:32.720
I haven't seen a damn movie, so shut up. I didn't spoil it lately. Have you seen the movie?

24:32.720 --> 24:36.160
What the fuck? Our bodies are made of water. That's a good point. People would explode.

24:36.160 --> 24:37.840
I would have liked that better.

24:37.840 --> 24:43.240
I liked Batman Begins because it had the set up of one of the 60's Batmans.

24:43.240 --> 24:50.320
Honestly, that would have been great, you know, they have this great plan and stuff.

24:50.320 --> 24:53.680
You know, the vaporized water and whatnot. And then people start explaining, they're

24:53.680 --> 24:57.840
all, well that's a good idea. That's an unseen side effect, but okay, hey,

24:57.840 --> 24:59.920
I'm going with it, you know.

24:59.920 --> 25:05.160
Poison people, make them explode, whatever, hey, it's the same, you know, consequence.

25:05.160 --> 25:08.700
uh... testing

25:08.700 --> 25:11.200
doesn't talk about it i think uh...

25:11.200 --> 25:12.480
they need more anyway

25:12.480 --> 25:14.420
uh... anything else to say about your week in a day

25:14.420 --> 25:15.960
uh...

25:15.960 --> 25:19.880
just pretty much just sticking around the house and in place to surround him

25:19.880 --> 25:22.000
that gives a lot of fun

25:22.000 --> 25:25.000
i've been playing a game nonstop only two i don't know what about an hour on

25:25.000 --> 25:27.440
podcast well the problem is that by the wages

25:27.440 --> 25:30.280
usually take our podcast right after the show so i'm kinda worried about

25:30.280 --> 25:33.360
tonight's pocket i don't care

25:33.360 --> 25:34.360
We'll see.

25:34.360 --> 25:38.400
No, but anyways, yeah, Destroy All Humans, awesome game, it's a lot of fun, what's great

25:38.400 --> 25:45.920
about it though is one, the main Martian or Furon, the alien race or whatever, is voiced

25:45.920 --> 25:48.360
by the guy that does Invader Zim.

25:48.360 --> 25:53.660
So it's Zim, the game is basically Invader Zim the game, it's just awesome, and they've

25:53.660 --> 25:58.680
got some other voice actors from other, you know, cartoons out there, I think there's

25:58.680 --> 26:02.800
a guy from King of the Hill and some other ones I recognized but I wasn't positive because,

26:02.800 --> 26:10.680
You know, I don't remember voice actor names, but Invader Zim Guy, I was like, oh, I love

26:10.680 --> 26:11.680
this game.

26:11.680 --> 26:16.040
And it's got, I think, because I didn't really watch the clip all the way, I think you can

26:16.040 --> 26:19.840
actually unlock the movie Plan 9 from Outer Space.

26:19.840 --> 26:20.840
That's kind of interesting.

26:20.840 --> 26:23.120
Yeah, and B movies and stuff.

26:23.120 --> 26:26.600
It's just, the whole game plays like a 50's B movie, and it's great.

26:26.600 --> 26:28.120
It's the best thing.

26:28.120 --> 26:29.120
So.

26:29.120 --> 26:30.120
Alright.

26:30.120 --> 26:31.120
I gotta go get a new drink.

26:31.120 --> 26:34.960
I'm looking at the Malibu pineapple, so Dark Sakura has to tell us about her week while

26:34.960 --> 26:35.960
I go do that.

26:35.960 --> 26:36.960
I've...

26:36.960 --> 26:37.960
Huh?

26:37.960 --> 26:46.440
I spent all week moving my shit from my apartment, which sucks a whole bunch of ass.

26:46.440 --> 26:52.040
It sucks an ass larger than that of Roseanne Barr at her biggest.

26:52.040 --> 26:53.920
Or Rosie O'Donnell at current.

26:53.920 --> 26:57.040
Oh god, that one was chunky.

26:57.040 --> 27:03.120
Anyway, I've moved all this stuff from the apartment, well Dan and I took two days off,

27:03.120 --> 27:08.920
and we got all this stuff from our apartment, and he says it's like a really twisted Christmas

27:08.920 --> 27:14.000
where you're opening all these presents that's full of your own shit and you don't know what's

27:14.000 --> 27:15.880
in what box.

27:15.880 --> 27:23.460
I've got the kitchen mostly unpacked, and um, I've been working on that today and yesterday

27:23.460 --> 27:28.700
And then we got our refrigerator, and we got our washer and dryer, and we spent over $2,700

27:28.700 --> 27:29.700
for that set.

27:29.700 --> 27:30.700
So you're in a house now?

27:30.700 --> 27:31.700
I'm in a house.

27:31.700 --> 27:32.700
Awesome.

27:32.700 --> 27:33.700
I'm going to be living there for some time.

27:33.700 --> 27:38.140
And I'm thinking that we might even move studio, maybe, if everyone's not opposed to it, because

27:38.140 --> 27:46.300
I live in citrus heights instead of Rancho, Cambodia.

27:46.300 --> 27:47.300
That happened too.

27:47.300 --> 27:48.300
Really?

27:48.300 --> 27:49.300
You don't say?

27:49.300 --> 27:52.580
I'm having very juicy burps, and I don't know why.

27:52.580 --> 27:54.140
I don't know.

27:54.140 --> 27:57.560
Dan's supposed to be here any moment now with my pants.

27:57.560 --> 27:58.820
And...

27:58.820 --> 28:01.900
I've got to go downstairs and prepare to be...

28:01.900 --> 28:03.300
pretend to be sober.

28:03.300 --> 28:06.380
And make it down the stairs. That's going to be fun.

28:06.380 --> 28:08.220
Just slide down the rail.

28:08.220 --> 28:14.820
We got a 50-inch freaking HD widescreen projection TV.

28:14.820 --> 28:16.380
And this thing...

28:16.380 --> 28:18.500
is huge.

28:18.500 --> 28:19.960
It's a very...

28:19.960 --> 28:21.960
Is it 50 inch huge?

28:22.960 --> 28:24.960
It is very satisfying.

28:25.960 --> 28:28.960
I could do that. I could ride that thing all night.

28:28.960 --> 28:29.960
Or watch it.

28:29.960 --> 28:33.960
You could ride. She's gonna ride the TV all night long.

28:33.960 --> 28:34.960
Did you hear that?

28:34.960 --> 28:37.960
I'm going to mix it onto the TV.

28:37.960 --> 28:39.960
For those of you keeping drink counts at home,

28:39.960 --> 28:44.960
I'm now drinking four shots of Malibu Pineapple mixed with 7-Up.

28:44.960 --> 28:47.960
And I have my DDR ice in there.

28:47.960 --> 28:48.960
Taste!

28:48.960 --> 28:53.720
i found ice trays at ikea now there are a lot of the i think it's like

28:53.720 --> 28:56.800
fish you know the drink is hella good by the way

28:56.800 --> 28:58.980
is that i think that i think the cochran

28:58.980 --> 29:00.080
the ice is kosher

29:00.080 --> 29:04.940
i thought that i didn't think of a ramp and that i want was i'm gonna start on

29:04.940 --> 29:06.180
them shot

29:06.180 --> 29:08.740
five in six i think

boxes

30:06.420 --> 30:09.660
i sleep surrounded by a dirty laundry

30:09.660 --> 30:13.740
because all of my laundry is dirty and we haven't had a washing machine

30:13.740 --> 30:18.400

I'm sorry for your neighbors, but I have lots of laundry-related aids.

30:28.640 --> 30:31.840
We realize what happens when they give us a can opener.

30:31.840 --> 30:33.840
I mean, come on, our bottle opener.

30:33.840 --> 30:37.340

30:53.440 --> 30:56.380
if i don't have liquor i'll shrivel up and die

30:56.380 --> 31:01.940
i think if we get a tv show i'm gonna always do it drunk

31:01.940 --> 31:04.260
you're gonna sit back and be like

31:04.260 --> 31:08.300

31:08.300 --> 31:11.900
I want to be wearing like one of those like you know leisure suit not

31:11.900 --> 31:15.940

31:15.940 --> 31:21.340
know like a bathrobe and like slippers and be sitting there with a martini some

31:21.340 --> 31:27.340
of those hosts on g4 have to be drunk to get through everyone in Hollywood is

31:27.340 --> 31:34.340
either drunk or on drugs. Or Lola skates.

31:34.340 --> 31:37.340
Lola skates? Lola! Lola skates!

31:37.340 --> 31:41.340
I was laughing! Oh my god, isn't the internet a nerd?

31:41.340 --> 31:46.340
Oh god. You know what, Rob? That can has been on your desk for a year.

31:46.340 --> 31:53.340
Chat room? No it hasn't. Chat room, they said I only had four drinks, but that is one Guinness and four shots.

31:53.340 --> 31:56.340
We're even right now, Trevor.

31:56.340 --> 32:02.340
We're going by government drinks, okay? Technically this would be a second drink if I were counting, you know, actual drinks.

32:02.340 --> 32:08.340
By actual drink numbers, Rob has had two, Loki has had two, I have had three.

32:08.340 --> 32:12.340
By shot, we are all dead tied at five.

32:12.340 --> 32:18.340
Well, I'm at four. I'm going to be starting at five in just a second here as soon as I finish the last bit of my drink.

32:18.340 --> 32:22.860
And I apologize for belching, but I'm having soda with my vodka right now.

32:22.860 --> 32:26.740
Which I... you all know that I am a belch monster already.

32:26.740 --> 32:29.860
That is my one highly unfeminine trait.

32:29.860 --> 32:33.660
Excuse me while I take a brief recess to get some more alcohol.

32:33.660 --> 32:36.980
I also have other unfeminine traits like climbing trees,

32:36.980 --> 32:38.920
and shooting people with guns,

32:38.920 --> 32:41.540
and driving a tank.

32:41.540 --> 32:45.980
It's the adventures of Lo!

32:45.980 --> 32:49.100
Oh my god! I could do a webcomic of that!

32:49.100 --> 32:51.420
Wouldn't that be spiking funny?

32:51.420 --> 32:54.740
You're gonna do a webcomic? LOL! LOL!

32:54.740 --> 32:56.460
No, I forgot!

32:56.460 --> 32:57.580
You're a burb!

32:57.580 --> 32:58.700
Locule burb!

32:58.700 --> 32:59.540
LOL!

32:59.540 --> 33:00.940
Did you say burb?

33:00.940 --> 33:01.620
Burb!

33:01.620 --> 33:02.620
Burb!

33:02.620 --> 33:07.740
No seriously, I'm gonna do the orange sounds webcomic, but I need someone who does flash.

33:07.740 --> 33:10.940
Cause we need to have our fictional studio online.

33:10.940 --> 33:14.180
Where everyone can explore and interact with us.

33:14.180 --> 33:17.780
Wow

33:17.780 --> 33:21.820
well yes I have an observation for you it's a very obvious one

33:21.820 --> 33:26.440
what's that? The shrimp is fucking hot! I know I'm I'm trying my best it's because you're drinking

33:26.440 --> 33:27.560
you're getting hot from drinking

33:27.560 --> 33:30.800
I'm just hot anyway we know we know

33:30.800 --> 33:34.340
alright my week of my day my week

33:34.340 --> 33:38.360
my ability is not indulging, it's staring at traffic lights

33:38.360 --> 33:43.300
No! Who is the diva of this show? I do not believe that it is you

33:43.300 --> 33:48.300
I am an internet fucking celebrity.

33:48.300 --> 33:52.300
I am not a celebrity who fucks the internet, except for screwing it over.

33:52.300 --> 33:57.300
I am an internet celebrity that makes me the diva of the show.

33:57.300 --> 34:00.300
Hello? My power cable just fell out of my lap.

34:00.300 --> 34:03.300
I'm an internet celebrity too. I have like 140 friends on my space. Come on.

34:03.300 --> 34:04.300
I have to plug myself in again.

34:04.300 --> 34:06.300
I have like 140 friends on my space.

34:06.300 --> 34:11.300
I joined Myspace a month ago and I have 42 people, including Corey Feldman.

34:11.300 --> 34:13.300
Cori Thumbt is my buddy.

34:15.300 --> 34:19.300
I want to make a Myspace profile for Adventures of Lol.

34:19.300 --> 34:20.300
I'm sorry.

34:20.300 --> 34:23.300
I made an Orange Zones one but I haven't done Chipotle yet.

34:23.300 --> 34:25.300
I am not in heat, shut up!

34:25.300 --> 34:27.300
If I were in heat you would know.

34:27.300 --> 34:30.300
Cause if it wouldn't be you I would be heat-mat.

34:31.300 --> 34:32.300
Wow.

34:32.300 --> 34:34.300
Are you finished so I can talk about my week? Cause my week sucked.

34:34.300 --> 34:36.300
Fuck your week.

34:36.300 --> 34:37.300
Fuck your week?

34:37.300 --> 34:39.300
I'll go to a break bitch.

34:39.300 --> 34:40.300
Turn off your mic.

34:40.300 --> 34:50.700
I give you permission to speak, oh, Rob, who sits by the computer, with your legs all crossed.

34:50.700 --> 34:54.060
You need a cigarette now, you are so like, you'd be so posh.

34:54.060 --> 34:59.380
You were the most supportive of me stopping smoking, and now you're like, you want a cigar

34:59.380 --> 35:00.380
tonight?

35:00.380 --> 35:01.380
You need a cigarette, Rob?

35:01.380 --> 35:03.380
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

35:03.380 --> 35:08.260
I do not believe in cigarettes, because cigarettes are very addicting.

35:08.260 --> 35:10.580
I do have my secret hidden stash.

35:10.580 --> 35:15.380
Clothes I'm fine with, because you best be hooking me up with that.

35:15.380 --> 35:23.380
I have found out from my fiancé, he's not really happy about it, but he is okay with

35:23.380 --> 35:25.260
me having a cigar every so often.

35:25.260 --> 35:30.920
So I picked up a pack of Black & Milds, because they're pipe tobacco, and pipe tobacco is

35:30.920 --> 35:31.920
sexy.

35:31.920 --> 35:33.540
We really don't endorse smoking, boys and girls.

35:33.540 --> 35:34.540
Don't start.

35:34.540 --> 35:35.540
So light them up if you got them!

35:35.540 --> 35:36.540
Don't start, kids.

35:36.540 --> 35:37.540
It's a nasty habit.

35:37.540 --> 35:42.060
habit is a nasty habit and if you have your lungs full a tar will laugh at you

35:42.060 --> 35:47.060
when you croak okay tell us about your week Rob I bet it was fascinating no my

35:47.060 --> 35:50.860
car was broken into for the second time this week which sucks you should move

35:50.860 --> 35:54.820
this time they smashed a window and they took my new stereo that the insurance

35:54.820 --> 35:59.100
company had replaced they dug through my car until they found my faceplate I mean

35:59.100 --> 36:02.580
okay stupid me for keeping my faceplate in my car but I had it in a secret spot

36:02.580 --> 36:06.460
where I didn't think anyone would find it and so I was kind of it I'll get I'll

36:06.460 --> 36:08.460
I'll get the fan in a little bit so it cools off in here.

36:08.460 --> 36:10.460
Wait, hold on.

36:10.460 --> 36:12.460
I'm giving Jamie some competition.

36:12.460 --> 36:14.460
You're red in the face, Oki.

36:14.460 --> 36:16.460
Oki, you're red.

36:16.460 --> 36:18.460
I'm going to give you my Zoom doll.

36:18.460 --> 36:22.460
I have a big plushy Zen pillow.

36:22.460 --> 36:24.460
I have a big plushy girl pillow.

36:24.460 --> 36:26.460
Oh, our chat room is www.org.com.

36:26.460 --> 36:30.460
Why is the chat room saying our stream dropped?

36:30.460 --> 36:32.460
No, we're still up. I think it's just one person.

36:32.460 --> 36:34.460
We always have it up.

36:34.460 --> 36:36.460
I'm always up

36:37.360 --> 36:42.800
No, we don't make me waste my body by spitting it on your face. I don't even want to discuss stuff like that

36:44.300 --> 36:46.860
Just because yeah, what what happened?

36:48.020 --> 36:50.020
Well, it's not what happened. It's

36:50.780 --> 36:55.280
We're not gonna go there cuz that's a little you know beyond the show format

36:55.280 --> 37:01.900
Okay, it's not no let's talk about Loki's sex life. It's not a bad thing either. It's good stuff, but okay

37:01.900 --> 37:03.380
you know it's just

37:03.380 --> 37:07.080
it's it's it's a side effect of having a cold

37:07.080 --> 37:09.480
i get a weird side effect

37:09.480 --> 37:10.560
and so

37:10.560 --> 37:13.080
it's just odd

37:13.080 --> 37:16.560
we're not going to talk about it okay

37:16.560 --> 37:20.800
i don't know what he's laughing about but can we get nellie in here to clarify

37:20.800 --> 37:23.800
i can tell you what it is but i'm not telling you

37:23.800 --> 37:27.800
i have a replacement for dunk

37:27.800 --> 37:29.560
what's that

37:29.560 --> 37:37.360
Derk. Derk. Alright. Anyway, um, what was all my car got broken into? And this time,

37:37.360 --> 37:40.920
instead of just prying open the door, they actually smashed on one of my windows, and

37:40.920 --> 37:45.080
the insurance company won't replace my broken window until a week from today. Isn't that

37:45.080 --> 37:50.660
stupid? So I'm driving around, oh, and, to add insult to injury, they fucked up my lock

37:50.660 --> 37:55.460
on the driver's side, so I can't even open my driver door. So, get into my car, I have

37:55.460 --> 37:59.980
to open up the passenger door, climb my fat ass across the seat, and then I get to sit

37:59.980 --> 38:00.980
down. It sucks.

38:00.980 --> 38:04.020
You sure? Well, do they fuck up the lock on the outside or the lock all together?

38:04.020 --> 38:06.860
They fucked it up. I can't open the door from the inside.

38:06.860 --> 38:10.460
Yeah, because my old car used to have to pop open the door on the passenger side, unlock

38:10.460 --> 38:11.660
the door, and then walk around.

38:11.660 --> 38:13.300
No, it won't even work. It won't even work.

38:13.300 --> 38:17.820
Because some dumbass tried to open the lock with a screwdriver and that didn't work.

38:17.820 --> 38:20.540
My door won't even open from the... I don't even know how they're going to fix it. It'll

38:20.540 --> 38:21.540
be incredible.

38:21.540 --> 38:25.540
But it's great, though. See, my old car, they were trying to steal the stock stairs.

38:25.540 --> 38:27.540
I have to tell something to Illusion real quick.

38:27.540 --> 38:28.540
What?

38:28.540 --> 38:31.540
MAAAWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!

38:31.540 --> 38:33.540
MAAAWWWWWWWWWWWW!

38:33.540 --> 38:34.540
Shush!

38:34.540 --> 38:36.540
MAAAWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!

38:36.540 --> 38:37.540
You have to tell him that you're Cat in Heat?

38:37.540 --> 38:40.540
MAAAWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!

38:40.540 --> 38:41.540
MAAAWWWWWWWWWWWW!

38:41.540 --> 38:44.540
Anyway, in the front room right now. By the way, shut up!

38:44.540 --> 38:45.040
MAAAWWWWWWWWWW!

38:45.040 --> 38:46.540
Stop it! I'm gonna set you up!

38:46.540 --> 38:48.540
I'm gonna set the ferret on fire.

38:48.540 --> 38:49.040
MAAAWWWWWWW!

38:49.040 --> 38:50.540
I don't even know where it is, to be honest.

38:50.540 --> 38:51.660
uh...

38:51.660 --> 38:53.020
uh...

38:53.020 --> 38:53.940
uh...

38:53.940 --> 38:55.740
the

38:55.740 --> 38:57.780
they're watching a dirty chain

38:57.780 --> 39:00.340
i thought it was really very it's great

39:00.340 --> 39:01.300
i like it

39:01.300 --> 39:03.660
here's my favorite impersonation

39:03.660 --> 39:07.860
uh... i thought was my week my car got broken into that some impersonation

39:07.860 --> 39:09.020
well i'm not

39:09.020 --> 39:12.380
i'll talk about this one of the podcast if i can come up to insanely drunk

39:12.380 --> 39:16.420
and i was playing media all all you really got that all it just came out

39:16.420 --> 39:21.140
out this past week. Well, I know. It's so hot. I love it. Meteos is like the reason

39:21.140 --> 39:29.940
why there's a DS. Meteos makes... I'm gonna shove that thing up your ass. Meteos is the

39:29.940 --> 39:34.860
reason why they made a DS, seriously. Like, everything good about the DS technology is

39:34.860 --> 39:40.880
used in Meteos. I love it. I want to make sweet love to it and have its babies. And

39:40.880 --> 39:42.880
those babies will be Nintendogs.

39:42.880 --> 39:46.880
Hey, hey, illusion, guess what?

39:46.880 --> 39:56.360
If I could stab this microphone to my brain, I'd do it right now, but since that's impossible.

39:56.360 --> 40:00.540
To answer a question in chat room, somebody's saying that in response to my car getting

40:00.540 --> 40:02.840
broken into, they say, that's what insurance is for.

40:02.840 --> 40:06.600
Yeah, well, I still have $100 deductible, which sucks, and they'll probably jack up

40:06.600 --> 40:09.320
my rates because it's the second time my car's been broken into.

40:09.320 --> 40:12.320
This is because you moved into Rancho, Cambodia.

40:14.320 --> 40:18.320
I swear, like, they're trying to...

40:20.320 --> 40:21.320
I don't know.

40:22.320 --> 40:23.320
You're drunk.

40:24.320 --> 40:28.320
It's because I fucking drank that double shot as fast as I did.

40:28.320 --> 40:31.320
I think we're going to go to break. How's that sound, kids?

40:31.320 --> 40:33.320
I get to pick the songs.

40:33.320 --> 40:35.320
Actually, there's one song I really wanted to play.

40:35.320 --> 40:37.320
Too bad. How does it feel to want it?

40:37.320 --> 40:40.320
Well, we had a request from the chat room, so I think we should honor it.

40:40.320 --> 40:42.320
To hear your reign, the original.

40:42.320 --> 40:44.320
Oh, I like your chat room, person.

40:44.320 --> 40:45.320
That was Misty.

40:45.320 --> 40:47.320
Misty, you were awesome.

40:47.320 --> 40:48.320
No, this is good.

40:48.320 --> 40:49.320
I've got music with me.

40:49.320 --> 40:50.320
Because it's a segue.

40:50.320 --> 40:51.320
It's a good segue.

40:51.320 --> 40:53.320
Because we're going to talk about Akira Yamamoto when we come back.

40:53.320 --> 40:54.320
If we can't.

40:54.320 --> 40:56.320
I need Kotemu Dxy.

40:56.320 --> 40:57.320
If I can find it.

40:57.320 --> 40:58.320
Let's do it again.

40:58.320 --> 40:59.320
All right.

40:59.320 --> 41:01.320
Well, this song's like four minutes, or five minutes.

41:01.320 --> 41:02.320
So we're going to play it.

41:02.320 --> 41:03.320
So we're going to come back and talk about Akira.

41:03.320 --> 41:10.320
Do that and then play, um, um, what's that other one, um, the one that's named after

41:10.320 --> 41:11.320
Beatles song.

41:11.320 --> 41:12.320
Let me do it.

41:12.320 --> 41:13.320
I'll see what we can do.

41:13.320 --> 41:14.320
Alright.

41:14.320 --> 41:16.320
We'll get some music and then we'll be back with more Orange on the State.

41:16.320 --> 41:17.640
And we're going to open up the Skype line.

41:17.640 --> 41:23.200
So if you guys want to talk to us in our, um, uh, uh, what's the word?

41:23.200 --> 41:24.200
Drunken state?

41:24.200 --> 41:25.200
I guess.

41:25.200 --> 41:26.560
Drunken, inebriated, I don't know, state.

41:26.560 --> 41:27.880
You won't have the opportunity when we come back.

41:27.880 --> 41:31.040
Go to OrangeOnTheState.com and click on interact with us.

41:31.040 --> 41:32.480
They said I looked red out there.

41:32.480 --> 41:34.480
Interesting. All right, we'll be back after this.

41:34.480 --> 41:36.480
Uran, the Rage Mix from Akira Yomoka,

41:36.480 --> 41:38.480
because we're going to talk about him when we come back.

41:38.480 --> 41:39.480
Akira.

41:39.480 --> 41:41.480
And how hot he is. We'll be back.

41:41.480 --> 42:10.720
associated with a Fedoke.

42:11.480 --> 42:19.480
Dancing alone again, again

42:19.480 --> 42:25.480
The rain falling on his hands

42:25.480 --> 42:33.480
Are you ready to dance with me?

42:33.480 --> 42:39.480
Nobody's showing me how to return from you

42:39.480 --> 42:45.480
You give to me, I'm gonna find me

42:45.480 --> 42:49.480
There's no stranger we want

42:49.480 --> 42:52.480
None of these

42:52.480 --> 43:02.480
Has ever more than you ever bring you down

43:02.480 --> 43:12.480
All that I need are some simple love of mine

43:12.480 --> 43:20.480
You've touched me by once, it hurts

43:20.480 --> 43:26.480
But stay with me, never forget

43:26.480 --> 43:30.480
Never again will be

43:30.480 --> 43:44.480
I get out of my head and I don't know what I found

43:44.480 --> 43:54.480
Over and over, I see you break me down

44:04.480 --> 44:09.480
On the sidewalk, on the city, on the streets of the wind

44:09.480 --> 44:12.980
Never see the people goin' nowhere

44:12.980 --> 44:15.480
There is no gettin' away

44:15.480 --> 44:17.980
So the passion and the love

44:17.980 --> 44:20.480
My resistance is waiting

44:20.480 --> 44:22.980
Like a flower in the basement

44:22.980 --> 44:28.980
Waiting for our love, yeah

44:58.980 --> 45:04.980
And I don't know what I've done

45:05.980 --> 45:15.980
Over and over I feel it break me down

45:15.980 --> 45:31.980
On the sidewalk of the city Comin' street, just don't remember

45:31.980 --> 45:36.980
See the people goin' nowhere See me talkin' no rage

45:36.980 --> 45:41.980
Comin' fashion, comin' matters My existence is waiting

45:41.980 --> 45:50.980
Like a flower in the basement, waiting for our lonely death

47:11.980 --> 47:25.980
Hello, you and I, we're a dream, we're a dream

47:25.980 --> 47:29.980
Monday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday

47:29.980 --> 47:31.980
With the cynical boom in the back

47:31.980 --> 47:34.980
Monday, Friday, Saturday, every night

47:34.980 --> 48:02.980
Oh, you said that I loved you

48:02.980 --> 48:06.480
Yeah, I need you

48:06.480 --> 48:08.480
Oh, oh, oh, oh

48:08.480 --> 48:11.480
You and I

48:11.480 --> 48:14.480
One by one

48:14.480 --> 48:18.480
Let it rain

48:25.480 --> 48:26.480
Hello out there.

48:26.480 --> 48:29.480
This is Rob, but you might know me in the online world as Sky.

48:29.480 --> 48:35.480
On June 23rd at 7pm Pacific Time, join Dark Sakura and I for the Orange Lounge,

48:35.480 --> 48:37.480
the Bomani Scene's newest talk radio program,

48:37.480 --> 48:40.480
where we'll talk about all the latest and everything Bomani.

48:40.480 --> 48:47.480
It's a whole show dedicated to those games that we never shut up about.

48:47.480 --> 48:54.480
Why the fuck did you play that one?

48:54.480 --> 48:55.480
Dark Sakura.

48:55.480 --> 48:59.480
Rod, put out your hand.

48:59.480 --> 49:01.480
You've been ferreted.

49:01.480 --> 49:03.480
That was funny.

49:03.480 --> 49:05.480
Considering that I never...

49:05.480 --> 49:15.480
I remember the crap you got for the first time that you played that game.

49:15.480 --> 49:18.480
And not just for me, okay? Not just for me.

49:18.480 --> 49:23.480
Dark Sakura. You know why I said it that way? Because it's like Coors.

49:23.480 --> 49:26.480
No one didn't want to come out.

49:26.480 --> 49:27.480
Huh?

49:27.480 --> 49:29.480
That burp didn't want to come out.

49:29.480 --> 49:31.480
I think we have some new people tuning into the station tonight.

49:31.480 --> 49:33.480
How many people? We're not like this all the time, okay?

49:33.480 --> 49:36.680
seriously this is one of our like really off nights because we're having our

49:36.680 --> 49:40.440
third birthday show tonight we're really drunk I would do this show drunk every

49:40.440 --> 49:44.600
week if I could but you realize that we had the iTunes 4.9 roll out this week

49:44.600 --> 49:49.400
and they built podcasting into iTunes now so it's been huge for us we have so

49:49.400 --> 49:55.440
many more listeners now thanks to iTunes making it really easy to subscribe to

49:55.440 --> 50:01.560
podcast we have like a million listeners. That was a sobering belch. For those of you guys

50:01.560 --> 50:06.560
keeping track at home, I am on shots six, seven, eight, and nine in my next drink. Four

50:06.560 --> 50:09.480
more shots of- Son of a bitch, I need to catch up. I'm almost

50:09.480 --> 50:13.520
down to five and six shots. I'm going to be getting seven and eight.

50:13.520 --> 50:19.000
I have to take it easy. And I need to actually visit the potty, because,

50:19.000 --> 50:21.880
you know- Dan is going to be here before too long with

50:21.880 --> 50:26.880
my pants. Arkadyum. Arkadyum.

50:26.880 --> 50:53.360
Arcanium42 made the funniest joke in the chatroom, Dark Likura.

50:53.360 --> 50:56.060
Loki was not a part of the show when we first started.

50:56.060 --> 50:57.660
That's right, I was a guest.

50:57.660 --> 50:59.060
Loki has to wait for his third birthday.

50:59.060 --> 51:00.060
He had to sit on the floor.

51:00.060 --> 51:03.460
Loki was a guest host for 19 episodes, and then we were like,

51:03.460 --> 51:05.660
well, what the fuck, we'll make him a host.

51:05.660 --> 51:10.060
But I feel bad for Angel, because Angel's now been a guest for probably like 50 shows.

51:10.060 --> 51:11.460
And she stopped showing up, though.

51:11.460 --> 51:13.560
Yeah, where is she?

51:13.560 --> 51:16.360
She wanted to come tonight, but because of my car break-in,

51:16.360 --> 51:18.860
I couldn't provide her transportation after tonight's show.

51:18.860 --> 51:20.060
She's listening, I'm sure.

51:20.060 --> 51:21.660
Or she's getting an archive of the show.

51:21.660 --> 51:26.660
But now DDR Angel's been sitting on the floor for like 50 episodes and now we're like,

51:26.660 --> 51:28.660
oh, three's too many.

51:28.660 --> 51:29.660
Sorry, DDR Angel.

51:29.660 --> 51:30.660
She's a chronicle.

51:30.660 --> 51:31.660
Oh, I'm a chronicle.

51:31.660 --> 51:34.660
Yeah, she's our chronic guest.

51:34.660 --> 51:35.660
The chronic, yo!

51:35.660 --> 51:36.660
She's our chronic.

51:36.660 --> 51:38.660
She's a blunt, yo.

51:38.660 --> 51:40.660
I'm gonna go have more liquor.

51:40.660 --> 51:41.660
Alright.

51:41.660 --> 51:42.660
Um.

51:42.660 --> 51:44.660
I get to pee first!

51:44.660 --> 51:48.660
Should I open up the skype line or should I talk about the Akira Yomoka album?

51:48.660 --> 51:49.660
Akira Yomoka.

51:49.660 --> 51:50.660
Akira Yomoka.

51:50.660 --> 51:55.660
Okuyomoka's getting his own album. It's coming out October 28th in Japan, so you won't be able to...

51:55.660 --> 52:02.660
Okuyomoka, by the way, did the song since last break. Okuyomoka, famous for his DDR music, BeatMania music, as well as Silent Hill.

52:02.660 --> 52:07.660
Hello. What else has he done? He did some music for Contra. Contra is Shattered Soldier, yeah.

52:07.660 --> 52:12.660
Yeah, and what else has he done? Some Rumble Roses, maybe a little? Rumble Roses, a few songs from that.

52:12.660 --> 52:17.660
He didn't do anything for Gradius 5, I don't think. Maybe.

52:17.660 --> 52:23.660
Either way, Akira Yomoka is the fucking man. He's awesome. We love him. And he's hot, to boot.

52:23.660 --> 52:34.660
So, he's got an album coming out October 28th, and there's going to be, I think, the interesting thing is that it's going to be twelve tracks, I think, but only like two of them are going to be Bamani songs?

52:34.660 --> 52:41.660
Yeah, and they didn't say anything about Silent Hill songs, but of course Silent Hill already has their own soundtrack, so who cares, right?

52:41.660 --> 52:49.620
But we have, let's see, two Bamani songs, six cover songs, which could be just about

52:49.620 --> 52:50.620
anything.

52:50.620 --> 52:53.740
I know what some of those...

52:53.740 --> 52:55.180
Two brand new songs.

52:55.180 --> 52:58.700
I know what some of those cover songs are.

52:58.700 --> 52:59.700
You don't know for sure.

52:59.700 --> 53:00.700
You think you might.

53:00.700 --> 53:01.700
I suspect.

53:01.700 --> 53:05.680
But I can't sing anything, of course.

53:05.680 --> 53:09.100
But yeah, I mean, Kiriyama Moku is awesome, so whatever he's going to do is going to be

53:09.100 --> 53:10.100
awesome.

53:10.100 --> 53:11.100
Yes, that's right.

53:11.100 --> 53:14.540
should be fun should be fun

53:14.540 --> 53:17.880
and if you want more information on that Konamistyle.jp has a whole page

53:17.880 --> 53:19.280
dedicated to the project

53:19.280 --> 53:23.460
so it's pretty awesome so check it out I am really dizzy

53:23.460 --> 53:29.580
let's see

53:29.580 --> 53:34.500
oh good point from John Fields we can make Angel the intern since Zero doesn't

53:34.500 --> 53:35.740
show up to the show anymore

53:35.740 --> 53:39.820
well I thought, wasn't Magus our intern at one point? No he's the eternal freshman of

53:39.820 --> 53:40.820
Orange Lounge I forgot

53:40.820 --> 53:45.320
He's the keeper of the... what was it? Portuguese joke book?

53:45.320 --> 53:48.320
That's right. He's the Portuguese joke book keeper.

53:48.320 --> 53:52.320
Oh man. I am... so... dizzy.

53:52.320 --> 53:56.320
I thought this was interesting, the story you posted earlier this week.

53:56.320 --> 53:59.320
We'll probably talk about this more on the podcast, but the PlayStation 3?

53:59.320 --> 54:02.320
Four hundred dollars to buy a PlayStation 3?

54:02.320 --> 54:04.320
Is it going to do my dishes?

54:04.320 --> 54:06.320
If not, fuck it.

54:06.320 --> 54:10.320
Well, you do have to understand the Xbox 360 games are sixty bucks each.

54:10.320 --> 54:14.320
Oh my, that is insane. That is insane.

54:14.320 --> 54:18.320
I mean, D of A is pretty cool, or D of A, it's like a bank suddenly.

54:18.320 --> 54:23.320
D or A, Dead or Alive, is pretty cool, but it's not $60 cool.

54:23.320 --> 54:30.320
No, it's not. And this is what I've got from like, you know, basically looking at the release dates we have for the

54:30.320 --> 54:32.320
I found my special though.

54:32.320 --> 54:33.320
That's cute.

54:33.320 --> 54:37.200
for the Xbox game. Actually, from what we've seen so far from what the

54:37.200 --> 54:40.040
publishers are telling us, but they're going to release their games and those are the

54:40.040 --> 54:41.200
launch games, of course.

54:41.200 --> 54:45.000
The Xbox 360 is supposed to be coming out around

54:45.000 --> 54:47.180
November 15th.

54:47.180 --> 54:51.360
Around the 15th. You work for a distributor. Yes, I do. So you get the inside scoop on

54:51.360 --> 54:51.800
when the

54:51.800 --> 54:53.720
app's coming out. Yes, I do.

54:53.720 --> 54:58.640
And so, yeah, it's going to be about $60 a game for the Xbox 360.

54:58.640 --> 55:03.080
I can only assume that the PlayStation 3 stuff is going to be about the same price. If they wanted to be cute,

55:03.080 --> 55:07.740
since it's 360, they release it on March 60th.

55:07.740 --> 55:08.740
I don't think so.

55:08.740 --> 55:09.740
That's not gonna happen.

55:09.740 --> 55:14.020
No, they're gonna release it on November, like, 16th or 15th.

55:14.020 --> 55:15.020
It's around there.

55:15.020 --> 55:19.020
I mean, because obviously dates change for the games a lot, so it's, you know, it's up

55:19.020 --> 55:23.460
in the air, but most of the publishers are saying that's gonna happen at that date.

55:23.460 --> 55:27.660
In our chatroom, Baka is saying that the games on PS3 are gonna be $60, too.

55:27.660 --> 55:28.660
Yeah, so, when we...

55:28.660 --> 55:32.380
Well, what the fuck is up with that, $60 for a game?

55:32.380 --> 55:34.380
I'm not going to spend $60 on a game.

55:34.380 --> 55:36.380
It's $10 more than what they're charging right now, so...

55:36.380 --> 55:38.380
Fuck that shit. I don't spend $50 on a game either.

55:38.380 --> 55:40.380
I know, but you know what?

55:40.380 --> 55:44.380
I spent $35 on Meteos, and that was like having to give up a finger.

55:44.380 --> 55:49.380
Well, you know, most PlayStation 2 games are, like, $49.99.

55:49.380 --> 55:50.380
No.

55:50.380 --> 55:51.380
Not when I buy them.

55:51.380 --> 55:52.380
I have Guinness now.

55:52.380 --> 55:53.380
Well, you know, they are.

55:53.380 --> 55:55.380
And they wonder why people try to pirate their games.

55:55.380 --> 55:57.380
$50 for a game?

55:57.380 --> 55:59.380
What about Katamari Damacy?

55:59.380 --> 56:01.380
Great game, $20, sold zillions of copies.

56:01.380 --> 56:07.500
of copy. $20. That should be a model for all games. Second game, though, is $29.99. I think

56:07.500 --> 56:12.660
for you it's $10, so... But still, though, it's worth the extra $10. It's still not,

56:12.660 --> 56:18.940
you know, $44. No, it's not. Not if they're putting out games like... I don't know. What's

56:18.940 --> 56:26.500
a game that sucked on PlayStation? Um... Driver 3. Okay, Driver 3. Yeah, I'm gonna pay $60

56:26.500 --> 56:28.700
for driver four

56:28.700 --> 56:32.420
could you know i think the i would pay sixty bucks for final fantasy twelve

56:32.420 --> 56:35.060
although that's why i was really in the driver series

56:35.060 --> 56:37.060
sucked after you know the first

56:37.060 --> 56:37.900
first game

56:37.900 --> 56:42.940
the second game just sucked ass in third game was simple or it was so bad it was

56:42.940 --> 56:43.900
funny

56:43.900 --> 56:45.260
but um...

56:45.260 --> 56:49.480
i don't know it's just you know they think they can justify that amount you

56:49.480 --> 56:51.520
know for the next-gen consoles because

56:51.520 --> 56:54.500
the graphics are better

56:54.500 --> 56:59.500
Game companies, this is why people hack your shit, because you're charging too much for your damn games.

56:59.500 --> 57:04.500
It probably costs more to actually make these games.

57:04.500 --> 57:09.500
And part of the cost involved...

57:09.500 --> 57:13.500
Let me finish my damn sentence, thank you.

57:13.500 --> 57:21.500
Part of the cost involved with the creation of the games also has to do with, you know, fighting loss of profit.

57:21.500 --> 57:23.500
They have to make

57:23.820 --> 57:29.340
For company to be considered successful. They have to make a certain amount over production cost

57:30.420 --> 57:38.820
Therefore if they are they're trying to accommodate for what they have already lost versus what they may stand to lose and do their prices accordingly

57:39.460 --> 57:44.400
Therefore a $10 markup in price is not unreasonable nor is it unexpected

57:45.220 --> 57:49.860
What other things could I buy for $60 all the liquor I bought tonight was $40

57:49.860 --> 57:52.420
that's more fun than driver three

57:52.420 --> 57:56.240
okay cuz basically games have been about fifty bucks since

57:56.240 --> 57:57.700
even the super nintendo

57:57.700 --> 58:01.220
that's been my i remember when my body was more street fighter was like a

58:01.220 --> 58:03.180
seventy dollar game

58:03.180 --> 58:07.620
yeah that's ridiculous i could get a gay cube i could get a game cube for

58:07.620 --> 58:11.380
seventy dollars that's ridiculous for a street fighter being that expensive

58:11.380 --> 58:14.580
but i remember most of my like you know super nintendo games being about you

58:14.580 --> 58:16.340
know forty nine ninety nine so i mean

58:16.340 --> 58:19.540
But it hasn't really changed that much since then.

58:19.540 --> 58:23.140
Granted, you know... I paid $60 for Killer Instinct when it came out on the Super Nintendo.

58:23.140 --> 58:25.060
That's bullshit.

58:25.060 --> 58:31.980
That was a shitty port. This was ten years ago that I bought this damn game.

58:31.980 --> 58:35.680
Yeah, with inflation and everything, that's like $80. Yeah, but seriously though,

58:35.680 --> 58:38.820
$60 isn't that bad. I mean, when you consider it...

58:38.820 --> 58:40.020
I mean,

58:40.020 --> 58:44.380
the system being $400, yeah, that kind of sucks.

58:44.380 --> 58:47.900
I would hope that this would be a little bit better than, you know, it's going to be playing

58:47.900 --> 58:53.460
the next-gen, like, whatever the media is going to be, like, HD DVD or Blu-ray or whatever.

58:53.460 --> 58:58.500
It's going to be playing that. So you've basically got, you know, next-gen players in that sense.

58:58.500 --> 59:03.340
You've also got, and I don't understand this, you know, PlayStation 3 for some reason had,

59:03.340 --> 59:07.920
like, three Ethernet ports on there. I don't know what the hell that's for, but I'm sure

59:07.920 --> 59:13.460
they're going to use it for something. And, I don't know, I think, you know, $3.99 for

59:13.460 --> 59:17.340
the system isn't that bad. People are going to be like, eh, it's kind of expensive, but

59:17.340 --> 59:20.700
they're going to pay for it. But the revolution, though, they're saying is going to be cheaper,

59:20.700 --> 59:27.700
much like how, you know, the DS was only $151, the PSP was, like, you know, $300, you know.

59:27.700 --> 59:32.260
So, you know, people might, if they're really, you know, concerned about cost, they'll pay

59:32.260 --> 59:37.420
for the, you know, the revolution versus the PS3 or the 360.

59:37.420 --> 59:40.500
I want to read some comments from the chat room. Moreinsolventradio.com, click on chat.

59:40.500 --> 59:44.820
I gotta go get more alcohol because I'm dizzy as hell, and if I drink some more, I might

59:44.820 --> 59:45.820
pass out.

59:45.820 --> 59:46.820
That'd be good.

59:46.820 --> 59:56.700
Sacorina says, I could buy a lot of Kleenex for $60 and could have more fun than Driver

59:56.700 --> 59:57.780
3.

59:57.780 --> 59:58.780
I agree.

59:58.780 --> 01:00:02.700
I could buy toilet paper and make a mess of somebody's lawn, and that would be more fun

01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:03.900
than Driver 3.

01:00:03.900 --> 01:00:05.900
I grabbed my booze instead of my microphone.

01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:07.900
What's wrong with this picture?

01:00:07.900 --> 01:00:08.900
That's good.

01:00:08.900 --> 01:00:11.900
I could wipe my ass and have more fun than drive for three weeks.

01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:17.500
Arkadian42, now DarkSagre, you're the resident Sega whore, our resident Sega man whore in

01:00:17.500 --> 01:00:19.980
the chat room, actually I think there's two of them because I think John Fields is a big

01:00:19.980 --> 01:00:25.120
Sega man whore too, but the other one that I know of, this local Arkadian42, huge Sega

01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:29.460
man whore, says that Phantasy Star IV was $100 when it first came out.

01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:30.460
Is that true?

01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:31.460
For real?

01:00:31.460 --> 01:00:32.460
I think so.

01:00:32.460 --> 01:00:33.600
I did it in a genesis at the time.

01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:38.600
That's crazy.

01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:41.040
Final Fantasy II was $80, says John Fields.

01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:42.040
I think that's right.

01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:43.880
I think I remember paying like $70.

01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:47.440
For why I didn't pay it, I begged my mommy, because I got straight A's.

01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:50.880
You little nerdlet.

01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:52.360
I got straight A's.

01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:55.960
No, you want to hear about my junior high school experience and straight A's?

01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:58.040
I got all A's.

01:00:58.040 --> 01:01:02.600
My first semester of junior high school, I got all A's and a B and P.E.

01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:04.920
But my parents never cared about P.E., so they always threw that out.

01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:06.000
They didn't count that.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:15.440
my mom would go, you got an A- in math? You know what I got? A D and a C because I didn't

01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:23.720
give a fuck. My school bored me, and I would make A's on all of my tests, but get zeros

01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:27.720
for homework because I wouldn't fucking do it. That was me too. I never did my homework.

01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:32.560
I was a bad boy. That first semester junior high, I went all downhill from there. I just

01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:36.600
started not doing homework and stuff and I slacked off and and look where I'm at

01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:42.700
now kids I I'm on an internet radio station you want to be like me we're

01:01:42.700 --> 01:01:49.840
fucking celebrities cuz we didn't do well in school baka wants to know how I

01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:55.880
got a B and PE because my mom I could run a mile in like 14 minutes that's how

01:01:55.880 --> 01:02:01.920
I got a B and PE my best friend in junior high and I used to walk the mile

01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:05.580
every day. We would run until the teacher couldn't see us anymore, then we'd walk the

01:02:05.580 --> 01:02:10.320
rest of it. It's awesome. One time, just to prove I could do it, I sprinted

01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:19.400
a half mile just to prove I could do it. I would barf if I ever tried that. It'd be horrible.

01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:25.200
I ran for it. I was so tired by the time I got there. But I beat everybody, damn it.

01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:31.540
And now I can't run because I'm injured. I have to make an announcement here. I think

01:02:31.540 --> 01:02:34.380
if the site's still up right now, because the site's been going like up and down. Oh,

01:02:34.380 --> 01:02:43.900
never mind. Never mind. I'll talk about it later. It's down. Let's go to... Baka says

Baka says, I'm Asian. I get 3.6s and 4.0s. I want to hear from an Asian who gets shitty

01:03:06.580 --> 01:03:11.420
grades. Seriously. I want to hear from somebody who defies the stereotype and gets like Cs

01:03:11.420 --> 01:03:16.140
and Ds. Because that's a messed up stereotype that all Asians get like good grades. Surely

01:03:40.900 --> 01:03:45.220
him talking about puking too. Hey, somebody in our chat room disputing us there. It's

Skypline! Fucking call us!

01:04:25.020 --> 01:04:26.020
I don't want to do, uh...

01:04:26.020 --> 01:04:28.520
Did you hear about Britney Spears?

01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:29.520
Shut up, shut up.

01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:31.520
She's still smoking and pregnant!

01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:34.520
Loki, for those, uh, keeping drink tally at home, what are you on now?

01:04:34.520 --> 01:04:36.020
I'm on 7 and 8.

We're getting a call.

01:04:38.020 --> 01:04:41.020
7 and 8 and I'm very, very, very dizzy.

01:04:41.020 --> 01:04:42.020
Let's go to the phone lines.

01:04:42.020 --> 01:04:43.520
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:04:44.020 --> 01:04:45.020
Hey Sky, Siggy here.

01:04:45.020 --> 01:04:47.020
Hi Siggy, how are you?

01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:50.520
I'm doing fine, uh, happy birthday, O.L.R.

01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:52.520
Thank you, appreciate it.

01:04:52.520 --> 01:04:54.520
Rob is sounding especially gay today.

01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:57.520
We're potty trained now, we're three years old and we're learning how to read.

01:04:57.520 --> 01:05:00.520
I'm a big kid now.

01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:02.520
What's on your mind, Siggy?

01:05:02.520 --> 01:05:05.520
Have a drink with us, Siggy. Are you 21?

01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:07.520
Well, I'm 25.

01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:09.520
Good, have a drink with us, Siggy.

01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:11.520
Well, I'd rather have sake, thank you.

01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:12.520
Oh, okay.

01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:14.520
I want some sake.

01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:16.520
It's too expensive, I couldn't buy that.

01:05:16.520 --> 01:05:18.520
I want sake, I'm only 30!

01:05:18.520 --> 01:05:23.520
Sock you, lady. Alright, what's up, Ziggy? What's on your mind?

01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:28.520
Oh, I got some, uh, an announcement, uh, regarding the magnitude of X12, Happy Sky.

01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:32.520
I was gonna say, you have some news on Happy Sky, don't you? What's up with Happy Sky?

01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:38.520
Uh, it's gonna, uh, in Japan it's gonna be released July 13th, which is gonna be nine days from now.

01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:43.520
Ooh, that's soon. That's awesome. Are there any, like, new songs that are supposed to be in the final release?

01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:48.520
Because you know how sometimes there's songs in the final release that weren't in the beta test?

01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:51.520
Are they doing any of that?

01:05:52.520 --> 01:05:59.520
They're already done with the location test, but there haven't been any new songs announced as of late.

01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:03.520
That would be great if there was a couple more new ones, though.

01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:05.520
Yeah.

01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:14.520
And then some other news. I don't think this has been announced, but Konami has already made their own record label.

01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:15.520
Really, huh?

01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:17.520
Yeah, it's called a 573 Records.

01:06:17.520 --> 01:06:20.520
That is the most awesome name ever.

01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:21.520
I'm not surprised.

01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:22.520
I have hiccups now.

01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:25.520
Is that what's labeled the Kiriyama Oak album is going to come out on?

01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:26.520
My hands know.

01:06:26.520 --> 01:06:35.520
I'm not sure, but when I checked the website for 573 Records, there are mostly hip hop and R&B artists that have signed up for it.

01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:37.520
What's the website?

01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:41.520
Here it is. Let me link it on the chat room.

01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:43.520
Okay, super. Thank you.

01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:52.520
You know, all this talk about Japanese music has me thinking about, did you hear about those huge Live 8 concerts that were going on yesterday?

01:06:52.520 --> 01:06:53.520
Yeah.

01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:55.520

01:07:24.320 --> 01:07:28.100
whether or not they'll be able to ship this stuff to me because you know it's not listed

01:07:28.100 --> 01:07:30.520
on the U.S. site but there are U.S.

01:07:30.520 --> 01:07:34.240
sections always like under construction type stuff so I'm wondering

01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:39.540
you know if I ask them you know to send this album that's not exactly on their

01:07:39.540 --> 01:07:42.760
U.S. list yet. That music by the way here in the background is on their

01:07:42.760 --> 01:07:47.320
website five seven for your records. Yeah if they'll be able to send me the new stuff because you know the first

01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:49.480
nine was just being announced now

01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:54.920
and Diverse Eight's out, and then there's Dear Taka and Dear Desire also.

01:07:54.920 --> 01:07:58.480
So I need to get those as well, and

01:07:58.480 --> 01:08:02.600
I don't know, and D7 I need to get as well, because I need to catch up with all their stuff,

01:08:02.600 --> 01:08:04.080
and I love...

01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:09.200
Oh my god, I gotta listen to the Trip Machine Dark Core version, and I love that.

01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:13.240
573 Records is a UMA creative production. That just makes me think that...

01:08:13.240 --> 01:08:15.560
UMA! UMA!

01:08:15.560 --> 01:08:17.760
Remember in Max?

01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:19.640
uh...

01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:24.520
was that a new you know what i'm talking about right you let me let me

01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:25.300
it

01:08:25.300 --> 01:08:26.660
thank you

01:08:26.660 --> 01:08:29.720
so my hands numb is that

01:08:29.720 --> 01:08:32.160
a bad thing i don't know

01:08:32.160 --> 01:08:35.560
i want to take a nap that's what i was thinking what the hell what else is on

01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:36.840
your mind

01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:38.160
well uh...

01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:42.240
there's a yet you you really know about dance eighty six point four right

01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:45.820
uh... is that what it is eighty six point four i thought it was like ninety

01:08:45.820 --> 01:08:52.360
I don't know okay 86.4. It's 86.4. It's a, you know, they pronounce it as a dansu yaroyo

01:08:52.360 --> 01:08:56.320
Or translated as a let's dance. Uh-huh, okay

01:08:56.320 --> 01:09:02.920
I saw the news on DDR Freak and I was just like, you know, 86.4. Wasn't that that stupid game that was coming out. I

01:09:03.700 --> 01:09:06.360
Remember like three panel dancing or yeah, yeah

01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:09.600
Whatever. Yeah

01:09:10.300 --> 01:09:12.300
Yeah, I heard about it, but

01:09:12.300 --> 01:09:20.300
You know, if I'm going to do any type of, like, three-panel dancing or anything like that, it's going to be, like, from Dance FM or something like that, or whatever that is.

01:09:21.300 --> 01:09:25.300
I'm not Dance FM. Um, Neon FM. That's what I meant.

01:09:29.300 --> 01:09:31.300
My brain feels numb.

01:09:31.300 --> 01:09:35.300
I know. Um, Ziggy, we got other people calling in, so I'm going to let you go. Is there anything else you want to share with us?

01:09:35.300 --> 01:09:36.300
That's all right.

01:09:37.300 --> 01:09:38.300
Hello?

01:09:38.300 --> 01:09:39.300
Nothing much else.

01:09:39.300 --> 01:09:40.300
Okay.

01:09:40.300 --> 01:09:44.800
Siggy, thanks for being a loyal fan of ours, but at least the past, at least, you've been listening what, at least a year now?

01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:46.800
Yeah, over a year.

01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:51.800
You know what you guys, here's something I gotta mention, and you know, I've been meaning to do this for a while.

01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:54.800
Hold on, let me say goodbye to Siggy first, unless you're gonna say something to Siggy, is this to Siggy?

01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:56.800
This is to everyone.

01:09:56.800 --> 01:09:59.800
I got nothing much else to say, just happy 4th of July.

01:09:59.800 --> 01:10:01.800
Thank you, have a good one Siggy, thanks for supporting us.

01:10:01.800 --> 01:10:03.800
Don't buy the crappy fireworks, stay cool.

01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:13.800
I don't like fireworks any of you, so yeah.

01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:35.800
I AM NO SRAMMING CANDLES

01:11:03.800 --> 01:11:05.800
Let's do that.

01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:07.800
I would drink some more of my drinks.

01:11:07.800 --> 01:11:09.800
I want to say hi to the caller.

01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:15.800
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:17.800
Hello, is this Sal's Pizza?

01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:21.800
No, this is not Sal's Pizza.

01:11:21.800 --> 01:11:23.800
Hey, Skye, it's John Fields.

01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:25.800
Hi, John Fields, how are you?

01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:27.800
I am...

01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:29.800
What's on your mind?

01:11:29.800 --> 01:11:31.800
Congratulations, I'm making it to three years.

01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:36.320
a long time and then

01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:39.160
you know memories i remember is uh...

01:11:39.160 --> 01:11:42.040
you were here once

01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:44.340
john you're here one for you

01:11:44.340 --> 01:11:46.200
yeah i was last year round

01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:50.840
this time actually tell tell our listeners what we're like in person

01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:55.640
i'm always a bit you guys where let's see you were back at the

01:11:55.640 --> 01:11:58.380
at that apartment building i believe right yeah

01:11:58.380 --> 01:11:59.620
the paper and

01:11:59.620 --> 01:12:05.160
at that point i don't think the machine had been started on by by looking at

01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:07.840
i don't know i don't think you have been

01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:11.800
uh... my job was there we have our layout in the old studio well you know

01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:15.500
what i need to play some more final fantasy it's been like waiting

01:12:15.500 --> 01:12:17.980
shush shush shush

01:12:17.980 --> 01:12:20.940
i think that the ability to act

01:12:20.940 --> 01:12:23.560
no doubt that you may speak

01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:25.600
yes and i thought i was there

01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:29.600
If so, you remember I actually stole Loki's library of songs and such.

01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:33.600
I vaguely recall, yes.

01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:39.600
Iron Man, didn't you take a tour of tech TV when you were out here and you were talking about how, like, awesome tech TV was, and then they got sold like the next day?

01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:42.600
I did, and I was really upset when G4 brought him out.

01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:44.600
Rob, get your fucking glasses over here.

01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:45.600
Let the caller talk.

01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:51.600
Sorry, Jamie's too busy thinking about drinking to be listing right now, but I am listing to you, John.

01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:54.600
Tech TV got sold the next day and you were pissed.

01:12:54.600 --> 01:12:57.600
It was more like a year, but yeah.

01:12:57.600 --> 01:13:00.600
I was hoping to get a job there, but I guess not.

01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:02.600
Did you say get a job with PETA?

01:13:02.600 --> 01:13:04.600
No, it's G4.

01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:05.600
Oh.

01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:07.600
Actually, you know what's really funny? This brings up a good point.

01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:10.600
This is a good segue, because somebody's chatting with me in private message right now.

01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:12.600
John, I don't mean to interrupt you, but you'll like this too.

01:13:12.600 --> 01:13:13.600
That's fine.

01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:17.600
Okay, DeepThought42 in our chat room, who I think might be a new listener.

01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:20.600
I don't recognize the name, but then again, I'm drunk, so I apologize.

01:13:20.600 --> 01:13:23.600
And you're talking, you've got a speaker way too loud.

01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:24.600
I'm sorry.

01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:31.440
Um, DeepThought42 was saying that on Attack of the Show, I guess they're looking for co-hosts

01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:32.440
Really?

01:13:32.440 --> 01:13:38.240
Right now, and he sent them an email saying that we should do it.

01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:40.360
So I think the rest of you guys should send them an email.

01:13:40.360 --> 01:13:42.040
Oh my god, that'd be awesome.

01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:47.120
If you want to know where to send that email, ask DeepThought42, because he knows.

01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:50.040
And send them an email saying that we should host.

01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:53.800
Although seriously, like, what if he sent that email last week and now they're listening

01:13:53.800 --> 01:13:56.880
tonight and we're all just fucked up out of our minds?

01:13:56.880 --> 01:13:58.520
They would totally are in.

01:13:58.520 --> 01:14:00.160
No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:04.400
This is our opportunity that we can prove that we fit in in Hollywood because we can

01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:06.520
perform drunk or on drugs.

01:14:06.520 --> 01:14:07.800
Dude, I am like-

01:14:07.800 --> 01:14:08.800
No, we don't do drugs.

01:14:08.800 --> 01:14:09.800
I don't do drugs.

01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:10.800
I don't do drugs.

01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:11.800
Drugs are not cool.

01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:12.800
I do Vicodin.

01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:13.800
But I'm not a prescription for Vicodin.

01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:18.000
I don't do drugs because I have- I can't swallow pills and I have a phobia with needles.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:23.080
So the drugs are out of the picture, but alcohol is perfectly fine.

01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:24.760
Alright, awesome.

01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:27.600
So anyway, I'm sorry John, what was your, why did you call in anyway?

01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:28.600
What's on your mind?

01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:29.600
Before we...

01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:30.600
Well I've got two things.

01:14:30.600 --> 01:14:31.600
Okay.

01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:36.160
First I'd like to reflect on one of my favorite memories, and that was actually when Karaoke

01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:37.160
Revolution...

01:14:37.160 --> 01:14:38.160
Oh God!

01:14:38.160 --> 01:14:39.160
No!

01:14:39.160 --> 01:14:44.040
Karaoke was singing, what was it, It's the End of the World, and then also I'm Staying

01:14:44.040 --> 01:14:46.320
In or whatever it was.

01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:47.320
That show was awesome.

01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:53.000
It was I'm Seeing In and it was, what was the other one, I want to say it was Complicated

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:54.000
or something.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:55.000
Yeah, it was awesome.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:58.400
It was, there's another one that Nellie was talking about yesterday.

01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:04.800
It was, oh god, I don't remember the song, never mind, I'm not even going to remember

01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:05.800
it.

01:15:05.800 --> 01:15:09.520
There was another song that she was saying that she was being in Karaoke Revolution and

01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:15.240
it was funny but, never mind, I can't remember it so, I'm not going to, yeah.

01:15:15.240 --> 01:15:20.240
That was one of my favorite shows, too, because any time Loki makes an ass out of himself is a good show to me.

01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:24.240
Well, you know, Karaoke Revolution Party Edition is going to be coming out in, I think, September.

01:15:24.240 --> 01:15:26.240
We are all over that shit, too, in September.

01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:34.240
No, no, not September. I'm sorry. It would be November. Actually, the same day, I think, Ultra Mix 3 is coming out.

01:15:34.240 --> 01:15:38.240
It will be November, I want to say, 23rd or something like that.

01:15:38.240 --> 01:15:44.240
That's going to be when Karaoke Revolution Party Edition is going to be coming out for all three systems.

01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:47.360
That's scary.

01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:52.880
Okay, so I'm trying to find a clip of that episode where he's singing, but I'm

01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:55.000
so drunk I can't navigate my computer right now.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:58.800
So I'll keep looking on it. I'll find one on my computer. I think I got one.

01:15:58.800 --> 01:16:02.840
That'd be awesome. It feels like someone was shot and Nova came straight into my brain.

01:16:02.840 --> 01:16:06.080
Somebody had it uploaded somewhere, so we gotta find that somewhere.

01:16:06.080 --> 01:16:09.320
I only have... the only

01:16:09.320 --> 01:16:14.080
Loki sound clip I have is somewhere else. I can't even...

01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:15.640
God, this is horrible.

01:16:15.640 --> 01:16:18.340
Okay, what's your other thing you wanted to call about, John?

01:16:18.340 --> 01:16:23.020
Well, I need to make an announcement, actually. As you all know, I am a huge

01:16:23.020 --> 01:16:28.760
fantasy star online whore, and after all the success that Red vs. Blue has had,

01:16:28.760 --> 01:16:31.840
I have decided to start my own machinima

01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:35.440
based on fantasy star online. So you're going to do, like, a fantasy star version of Red vs. Blue?

01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:41.360
You have to play PSO on P... Rob, turn the speaker down. I'm sorry. That's the only way I can hear the Skype.

01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:42.360
Well, you need to...

01:16:42.360 --> 01:16:43.360
Here, it's down.

01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:44.360
It's down.

01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:47.360
You need to play PSO with me.

01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:49.360
Okay, now I can hear.

01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:50.360
Johnny there?

01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:51.360
Yeah, I am.

01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:52.360
Oh.

01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:56.840
Basically, it's really in the early production stages, but I've worked out how I'm going

01:16:56.840 --> 01:17:03.200
to make the camera work, and at this point, I'm actually trying to figure out how to get

01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:08.120
the characters that aren't androids to actually move their mouths.

01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:14.620
And I found someone that managed to do that, but he got a little scared after he saw how

01:17:14.620 --> 01:17:16.540
much work there was.

01:17:16.540 --> 01:17:21.980
But I'm going to post him what he showed me in the chat room as well.

01:17:21.980 --> 01:17:29.080
So if anybody wants to sign on and help make this a reality, I'm asking for any help I

01:17:29.080 --> 01:17:30.080
can get at this point.

01:17:30.080 --> 01:17:31.340
John, more power to you.

01:17:31.340 --> 01:17:34.080
Red vs. Blue is hilarious, and PSO is a great game.

01:17:34.080 --> 01:17:37.060
So any luck that you have with this, I think it would be awesome.

01:17:37.060 --> 01:17:42.060
So plug away in our chat room, and chatters, help John out, because this is a good project.

01:17:42.060 --> 01:17:43.060
Definitely.

01:17:43.060 --> 01:17:48.060
I wanted to participate in this, because I think that being the diva I am, I must be

01:17:48.060 --> 01:17:49.060
involved.

01:17:49.060 --> 01:17:52.420
Well, and also, I mean, especially, I mean, look at Red vs. Blue, they're basically now

01:17:52.420 --> 01:17:56.300
a spokesperson for like Halo and stuff, I mean, that's awesome, and you've-

01:17:56.300 --> 01:17:59.860
John, you could be the Sega spokesperson, would that just not make you a happy little

01:17:59.860 --> 01:18:01.140
fanboy or what?

01:18:01.140 --> 01:18:04.460
Well, I applied to be a GM last year, but that didn't work out.

01:18:04.460 --> 01:18:05.460
Oh my god.

01:18:05.460 --> 01:18:06.460
That's as close as I'm gonna get.

01:18:06.460 --> 01:18:17.460
You know what? I actually have a business card, or at least I had a business card, for a guy that was the Halo, or not the Halo, the 188, so drunk.

01:18:17.460 --> 01:18:33.460
Anyways, no, no, the Sega guy that was the, um, I want to say the production manager there at Sega that they won, um, I met them at, um, what was it, one of these, um, like film festivals or whatnot, and they were talking about video games and whatnot, and they were there.

01:18:33.460 --> 01:18:38.460
But actually, the guy at Sega, he gave me his card and whatnot to contact him.

01:18:38.460 --> 01:18:45.460
I was supposed to have a meeting with him about some idea I had for some game, but then after a while I thought,

01:18:45.460 --> 01:18:50.460
nah, it's not going to be a good game idea, so I didn't end up calling him back.

01:18:50.460 --> 01:18:53.460
Let's see if I can find that card somewhere.

01:18:53.460 --> 01:18:58.460
Alright, and I've actually spoken with one of the GMs already about this project, and he's really interested,

01:18:58.460 --> 01:19:01.460
so hopefully I'll get the support of Sega behind me as well on this one.

01:19:01.460 --> 01:19:06.940
Good John make it happen. You've got our support. We'll plug it on the podcast or something. All right. All right

01:19:06.940 --> 01:19:08.940
Thank you. Have a good one John. Thanks for calling in

01:19:09.300 --> 01:19:14.260
Okay, and once again happy third answer. Thank you. And thanks for supporting us over the past couple years. We appreciate it

01:19:14.660 --> 01:19:16.660
Okay, have a super day

01:19:17.220 --> 01:19:20.300
Later hold on. I have that Loki sound clip you guys

01:19:20.300 --> 01:19:29.300
Stop. God. Damn. Ow my foot! Why did I shoot myself in my foot? Oh my god, it hurts so bad!

01:19:29.300 --> 01:19:31.300
I need that for walking!

01:19:31.300 --> 01:19:35.300
No! My foot! I need that for walking!

01:19:35.300 --> 01:19:44.300
I just want to point out, somebody named Bamani K just joined our chat room, and I'm thinking if you gave your computer to your sister...

01:19:44.300 --> 01:19:49.300
She's not joining the chat room. She doesn't even know. She's on dial-up. Come on now.

01:19:49.300 --> 01:19:56.260
now. Somebody named Bamani K just joined the chatroom and says, hi, Loki, we love you.

01:19:56.260 --> 01:20:03.140
It's not her, trust me. No, I said, is that Loki's sister? And they said, yup, and family

01:20:03.140 --> 01:20:11.820
is listening. She is not, it is not her, trust me. My family, first off, no, it's not even

01:20:11.820 --> 01:20:18.540
her. You are so screwed if that person's telling you. It is not her! They're telling me yes

01:20:18.540 --> 01:20:25.540
No, it's not my sister. First off, okay, first off, she's on dial-up, okay? That's for one.

01:20:25.540 --> 01:20:26.540
You could join a chairroom in dial-up.

01:20:26.540 --> 01:20:31.540
And first, and second, okay, um, she doesn't know how to use the damn IRC anyway.

01:20:31.540 --> 01:20:32.540
What if she, what if she learned?

01:20:32.540 --> 01:20:36.540
She doesn't know how to use the internet? Come on now!

01:20:36.540 --> 01:20:37.540
Okay.

01:20:37.540 --> 01:20:40.540
She uses Juno to connect to the goddamn internet, okay?

01:20:40.540 --> 01:20:45.540
But, Monty Cade, you've gotta, you've gotta say something that only Loki would know, and then I'm gonna

01:20:45.540 --> 01:20:47.540
I can't even read the chat room right now.

01:20:47.540 --> 01:20:49.540
I'm gonna pee my pants laughing. I will say it on air.

01:20:49.540 --> 01:20:51.540
I am so drunk, I can't even see the chat room.

01:20:51.540 --> 01:20:53.540
It's just like a bunch of blur.

01:20:53.540 --> 01:20:55.540
I need to finish my drink and get another one.

01:20:55.540 --> 01:20:57.540
Your whole family is listening to you.

01:20:57.540 --> 01:20:59.540
They are not listening to me right now.

01:20:59.540 --> 01:21:01.540
You might want to cut it off.

01:21:01.540 --> 01:21:03.540
They are not listening to me right now.

01:21:03.540 --> 01:21:05.540
They have better things to be...

01:21:05.540 --> 01:21:07.540
They've been watching like, you know, some movie or something.

01:21:07.540 --> 01:21:09.540
They're not listening to my god damn show.

01:21:09.540 --> 01:21:11.540
I can't even... Okay.

01:21:11.540 --> 01:21:13.540
Where is the money?

01:21:13.540 --> 01:21:17.820
He goes to the mom, Gma, Gpa, and sis listening.

01:21:17.820 --> 01:21:20.820
Oh god, I'm gonna cry.

01:21:20.820 --> 01:21:30.420
Well, you know what, that could be them because my grandma and grandpa are at my mom's house.

01:21:30.420 --> 01:21:32.300
You are so screwed.

01:21:32.300 --> 01:21:41.180
Well, if that's the case, hello family, I am drinking right now and I am-

01:21:41.180 --> 01:21:43.180
I'm being responsible, he has a designated driver here.

01:21:43.180 --> 01:21:45.180
I have a designated driver, and I am quite...

01:21:45.180 --> 01:21:47.180
This is all a ratings stunt.

01:21:47.180 --> 01:21:50.180
Hey, DarkSocker, get this, Loki's family is listening right now.

01:21:50.180 --> 01:21:53.180
Designated driver three?

01:21:53.180 --> 01:21:55.180
Sit down.

01:21:55.180 --> 01:21:57.180
Anyway, we have somebody on the phone.

01:21:57.180 --> 01:21:59.180
Run, Sean!

01:21:59.180 --> 01:22:02.180
Oh, Bamani Kate says, how's, how's Tutor Train?

01:22:02.180 --> 01:22:04.180
This is my favorite show ever.

01:22:04.180 --> 01:22:06.180
Is Tutor Train a reference?

01:22:06.180 --> 01:22:08.180
Tutor Train? What the fuck is that?

01:22:08.180 --> 01:22:10.180
Run, Sean, don't lie, Sean.

01:22:10.180 --> 01:22:13.180
Your grandparents are listening, don't say that word!

01:22:13.180 --> 01:22:16.180
I can't read this stuff, it's too small!

01:22:16.180 --> 01:22:17.180
It's supposed to be shut up.

01:22:17.180 --> 01:22:19.180
Okay, I will kill our car.

01:22:19.180 --> 01:22:22.180

Ramo, what's on your mind?

01:24:06.780 --> 01:24:09.780
Not much. Um, I want to talk about the DOA movie.

01:24:09.780 --> 01:24:11.780
Yes, the DOA movie. What's up?

01:24:11.780 --> 01:24:17.780
The guy that's playing Ryu Hayabusa, Ken Kosugi. Do you know who his father is?

01:24:17.780 --> 01:24:20.780
Oh, I'm sorry, what?

01:24:20.780 --> 01:24:22.780
Do you know who his father is?

01:24:22.780 --> 01:24:23.780
No, who?

01:24:23.780 --> 01:24:30.780
Sho Kosugi. He did all those ninja movies from the 80s, and he also helped put together Ten-

01:24:30.780 --> 01:24:34.660
Wait, you cut out there, he also helped put together what?

01:24:34.660 --> 01:24:38.140
He did the choreography for Tenchu, Step Assassins.

01:24:38.140 --> 01:24:39.140
Awesome.

01:24:39.140 --> 01:24:43.660
Yeah, I just posted a link about that, so...

01:24:43.660 --> 01:24:46.800
This guy plays on everything, so you know what?

01:24:46.800 --> 01:24:51.420
They got the perfect person to play on Ryu, that's all.

01:24:51.420 --> 01:24:52.660
That sounds awesome to me.

01:24:52.660 --> 01:24:56.820
I'm looking forward to the Dead or Alive movie, even though I'm not a huge fan of the games,

01:24:56.820 --> 01:25:00.780
I just I I'm really hoping they don't screw one of those movies up

01:25:01.420 --> 01:25:07.900
Same here last I heard about the movie which was back in 2000 2001 William Shatner was supposed to be a part of it

01:25:07.900 --> 01:25:10.600
Heck no, heck. No, I'm glad that didn't happen

01:25:11.340 --> 01:25:13.340
You ain't the only one

01:25:13.340 --> 01:25:15.460
Right on what else is on your mind Rama? Oh

01:25:15.980 --> 01:25:23.380
Not much. I just went to a convention couple weeks back. You know, we have fun got drunk orgy, you know the normal chaos hot

01:25:23.380 --> 01:25:24.380
I'm not.

01:25:24.380 --> 01:25:32.020
We have Matt's parents listening. Please don't say those types of things on air. That's not

01:25:32.020 --> 01:25:33.020
good.

01:25:33.020 --> 01:25:34.020
Like orgy?

01:25:34.020 --> 01:25:35.620
Yeah, don't say that word. That's a dirty word.

01:25:35.620 --> 01:25:37.540
So I can't say orgy anymore?

01:25:37.540 --> 01:25:39.100
No, you can't. It's banned tonight.

01:25:39.100 --> 01:25:41.940
So orgy's a banned word?

01:25:41.940 --> 01:25:45.460
I don't know if Loki's going to come back on air. I think he's too embarrassed. I think...

01:25:45.460 --> 01:25:46.460
Oh, here he comes.

01:25:46.460 --> 01:25:47.460
And I'm John.

01:25:47.460 --> 01:25:48.460
Yes.

01:25:48.460 --> 01:25:49.460
They are actually listening.

01:25:49.460 --> 01:25:50.740
Oh, my purse is ringing.

01:25:50.740 --> 01:25:54.180
yes yes i think that they wanted to know where you went

01:25:54.180 --> 01:25:55.820
uh...

01:25:55.820 --> 01:26:00.380
you know they are actually listening to the show

01:26:00.380 --> 01:26:01.860
probably

01:26:01.860 --> 01:26:05.860
that i have not been done the federal family laughing out of it

01:26:05.860 --> 01:26:08.700
just think of this

01:26:08.700 --> 01:26:10.340
because this is a

01:26:10.340 --> 01:26:14.020
uh... a right of passage this is something that every young man must go

01:26:14.020 --> 01:26:16.180
through

01:26:16.180 --> 01:26:20.940
when your mom finds out that you're a drunk on the internet

01:26:20.940 --> 01:26:23.540

01:26:23.540 --> 01:26:25.640

01:26:28.340 --> 01:26:31.860

01:26:42.120 --> 01:26:46.840
I'm on 9, Loki's on, he's got a full glass on. Is that 7 and 8?

01:26:46.840 --> 01:26:48.920
I think that's like 9 and 10.

01:26:48.920 --> 01:26:55.140
He's got another double shot, whatever that is, and DarkSakura, what drink number are you on, for those keeping count at home?

01:26:55.140 --> 01:26:57.600
Six. She's putting up six fingers.

01:26:57.600 --> 01:27:00.880
I can't believe that my family is listening to this, this is crazy.

01:27:00.880 --> 01:27:05.840
Well, the six is counting actual number of drinks,

01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:07.360
not counting shots.

01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:11.520
Why are people listening to me? I mean, that's so crazy.

01:27:11.520 --> 01:27:15.640
Rama, we gotta go. Because you are fucking hilarious. I know I am.

01:27:15.640 --> 01:27:17.840
Bye-bye.

01:27:17.840 --> 01:27:22.800
No, no, Ron-chan can't go. I already hung up on him, I'm sorry. Ron-chan has to come back.

01:27:22.800 --> 01:27:25.680
Well, what do you want to tell him? He's listening.

01:27:25.680 --> 01:27:26.800
Nothing.

01:27:26.800 --> 01:27:31.240
Alright, so about those, you know, dancing games.

01:27:31.240 --> 01:27:35.400
Ah, who fucking plays those anymore?

01:27:35.400 --> 01:27:38.400
I can't believe my grandparents are listening to this crazy...

01:27:38.400 --> 01:27:42.400
I'm sorry, I'm sorry to, for Matt's grandparents, I'm normally much left without help.

01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:48.400
I know, we are all, I have to go over to their, to my mom's house tomorrow to actually, like, you know, do Fourth of July stuff.

01:27:48.400 --> 01:27:49.400
We're outstanding.

01:27:49.400 --> 01:27:54.400
We're actually outstanding citizens of the community, and we do charity work and all that, don't we?

01:27:54.400 --> 01:27:55.400
No.

01:27:55.400 --> 01:27:56.400
I did charity work.

01:27:56.400 --> 01:27:57.400
Okay, you can turn the speaker down now.

01:27:57.400 --> 01:27:58.400
Okay, sorry.

01:27:58.400 --> 01:28:04.400
All I gotta say right now is, for some reason, my hand is numb and I don't know why that is, my lips are numb.

01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:10.400
And I have a full drink here, so I've got to finish that, and I don't know.

01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:13.400
I mixed Loki a super yummy drink.

01:28:13.400 --> 01:28:16.400
Thank God I have a designated driver.

01:28:16.400 --> 01:28:20.400
Yes, again boys and girls, if you are going to drink, have a designated driver.

01:28:20.400 --> 01:28:22.400
We were model citizens and we planned designated drivers.

01:28:22.400 --> 01:28:25.400
No, no, no, no, you were wrong, Chet. You were wrong, DT.

01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:28.400
Because I have had six actual drinks.

01:28:28.400 --> 01:28:31.400
I've had one, two beers.

01:28:31.400 --> 01:28:39.400
I have had 10 shots, including my beers.

01:28:39.400 --> 01:28:42.400
That's great. I get to go face my family tomorrow.

01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:43.400
That's awesome.

01:28:43.400 --> 01:28:48.400
So fix it! Fix it now!

01:28:48.400 --> 01:28:52.400
What did you put in here? Did you just put two shots? Because it tastes sort of like...

01:28:52.400 --> 01:28:59.400
I mixed two oranges. I mixed a half shot of the pineapple rum and two shots of vodka.

01:28:59.400 --> 01:29:03.800
tastes like the pineapple in there. I was trying to make you a more tropical drink.

01:29:03.800 --> 01:29:09.240
Okay whatever. I want to try a sip of it though. Give me. Alright here you go. Oh man. Now

01:29:09.240 --> 01:29:13.840
that you're not spilling it all over the damn kitchen. I'm not spilling anything okay. It's

01:29:13.840 --> 01:29:17.880
actually pretty good. You did too freaking spill it all over the damn kitchen. Yeah but.

01:29:17.880 --> 01:29:23.320
Cause poor Exifer was down there with a towel on his hands and knees scrubbing up after

01:29:23.320 --> 01:29:27.080
your freaking sloshy liquor ass.

01:29:27.080 --> 01:29:30.440
Listen, I brought the towel with me, okay? I brought the paper towel with me.

01:29:30.440 --> 01:29:34.120
You brought one with you. Okay, okay. No, no, no. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck that.

01:29:34.120 --> 01:29:38.120
You had the towel with you in here.

01:29:38.120 --> 01:29:41.640
You were spilling freakin' orange juice all over the goddamn floor. And if

01:29:41.640 --> 01:29:44.800
orange juice left unchecked, tends to mutate

01:29:44.800 --> 01:29:48.520
and collect dust bunnies, which turn into a huge fucking mess.

01:29:48.520 --> 01:29:52.600
Okie dokie. So you, sir,

01:29:52.600 --> 01:29:58.600
Spilled the orange juice on the floor, and it's not for the valiant-

01:29:58.600 --> 01:29:59.600
Can we move on?

01:29:59.600 --> 01:30:01.600
No, no, no, no, I am not done.

01:30:01.600 --> 01:30:06.600
It's not for the valiant efforts of your roommate, Rob.

01:30:06.600 --> 01:30:07.600
Extover?

01:30:07.600 --> 01:30:08.600
Yes.

01:30:08.600 --> 01:30:13.600
There would be, you would be stepping in quagmire every time you entered the kitchen.

01:30:13.600 --> 01:30:17.600
Something along the lines of my ex apartment.

01:30:17.600 --> 01:30:18.600
Quagmire.

01:30:18.600 --> 01:30:20.600
Can we, can we please?

01:30:20.600 --> 01:30:21.600
Hey, we should go...

01:30:21.600 --> 01:30:22.600
What?

01:30:22.600 --> 01:30:23.600
Green Pong!

01:30:23.600 --> 01:30:28.640
Your sister says, uh, have fun, Orange Lounge, be safe, bye, your family, see you on the

01:30:28.640 --> 01:30:29.640
4th.

01:30:29.640 --> 01:30:33.920
Why are they listening to this show?

01:30:33.920 --> 01:30:35.880
Shame on them!

01:30:35.880 --> 01:30:38.120
So they have something to put in the Christmas card.

01:30:38.120 --> 01:30:43.000
I guess, but I'm surprised that they were able to connect to this show.

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:47.960
Look at it this way, Loki's family, out there, listening.

01:30:47.960 --> 01:30:51.280
There are many, many worse things that Loki could be doing right now.

01:30:51.280 --> 01:30:52.700
He doesn't do drugs.

01:30:52.700 --> 01:30:54.960
He's a drug-free American citizen.

01:30:54.960 --> 01:30:57.160
I only drink on week two weekends.

01:30:57.160 --> 01:31:00.400
He provides a service to the youth of America.

01:31:00.400 --> 01:31:02.480
He teaches them to stay in school.

01:31:02.480 --> 01:31:03.480
Right.

01:31:03.480 --> 01:31:07.520
You have to be the one to end up like me.

01:31:07.520 --> 01:31:08.920
Alright.

01:31:08.920 --> 01:31:12.800
Um, I've really got to go to the bathroom.

01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:13.800
So we're going to go to a cage match.

01:31:13.800 --> 01:31:16.040
Okay, we're going to go to a cage match and then we'll come back and we'll take more

01:31:16.040 --> 01:31:17.040
snacks.

01:31:17.040 --> 01:31:20.920
last week's program and i'm going to have a lot of

01:31:20.920 --> 01:31:24.580
i didn't win when we're getting one more call i think this is from a new

01:31:24.580 --> 01:31:26.440
listeners so that i take this call

01:31:26.440 --> 01:31:29.760
okay to me like it when new people call it so i think i picked it up

01:31:29.760 --> 01:31:34.040
higher on our front radio

01:31:34.040 --> 01:31:37.520
all your very very quiet on their deep top where he is there any way to talk to

01:31:37.520 --> 01:31:39.080
your microphone or

01:31:39.080 --> 01:31:40.120
uh... called on

01:31:40.120 --> 01:31:41.200
okay

01:31:41.200 --> 01:31:45.480
what should i hold on a little bit talk again

01:31:45.480 --> 01:31:46.400
hold on a second

01:31:46.400 --> 01:31:49.960
okay he's very very quiet boys and girls we're sorry

01:31:49.960 --> 01:31:54.080
it's always the quiet ones we can watch out for we could barely hear you my

01:31:54.080 --> 01:31:57.580
friend

01:31:57.580 --> 01:31:58.920
hello

01:31:58.920 --> 01:32:00.920
i think he might have turned off the

01:32:00.920 --> 01:32:04.960
no just give him a moment to adjust

01:32:04.960 --> 01:32:08.240
see i can hear you just as loud as i can hear him

01:32:08.240 --> 01:32:13.240
Oh, that's right. We'll give you a tip in the chatroom, and then why don't you call us back after the cage match, alright?

01:32:13.240 --> 01:32:14.240
Alright, thanks.

01:32:14.240 --> 01:32:15.240
Alright, later.

01:32:15.240 --> 01:32:16.240
Later.

01:32:16.240 --> 01:32:19.240
I can hear myself on there. That's kind of weird. He's very quiet.

01:32:19.240 --> 01:32:20.240
He's got a very low dela-

01:32:20.240 --> 01:32:21.240
Microphone again!

01:32:21.240 --> 01:32:22.240
Sorry, I'm trying to get down.

01:32:22.240 --> 01:32:23.240
You gave me a freakin' headache.

01:32:23.240 --> 01:32:24.240
Wow.

01:32:24.240 --> 01:32:26.240
He's got a very small delay, though.

01:32:26.240 --> 01:32:27.240
Yeah, he must have a fast-

01:32:27.240 --> 01:32:29.240
He has to be near to us.

01:32:29.240 --> 01:32:31.240
He must have a fast internet connection, so.

01:32:31.240 --> 01:32:35.240
Everything's spinning. That's...fun.

01:32:35.240 --> 01:32:40.240
You know what, you're fucked up, and I'm like not even half there, so whatever.

01:32:40.240 --> 01:32:42.240
Nah, it's okay. I still have to finish my drink.

01:32:42.240 --> 01:32:47.240
Because I need to save room in my liquor tolerance for the club tonight, so I can get my hoe on.

01:32:47.240 --> 01:32:54.240
I think this is the most drunkness I've been, you know, because honestly when I was at my San Diego-

01:32:54.240 --> 01:32:56.240
I'm already sobering up, so it doesn't even matter.

01:32:56.240 --> 01:33:00.240
Well, at my San Diego event, you know, I thought I was pretty drunk, but this is pretty bad,

01:33:00.240 --> 01:33:04.080
pretty bad cuz I mean like I actually feel like I'm gonna like fall over and

01:33:04.080 --> 01:33:08.480
just pass out or something but you know I'm we really need to go to a cage match

01:33:08.480 --> 01:33:15.040
kids cuz I've got to pee right here in the studio I brought my zip drive here

01:33:15.040 --> 01:33:19.320
we go let's talk nice get it doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo

01:33:19.320 --> 01:33:27.680
there it is the way the way the case three songs we're gonna play through

01:33:27.680 --> 01:33:35.560
You get to vote for your favorite, and the winning song goes into rotation all week long

01:33:35.560 --> 01:33:39.320
on Orange Lounge Radio Live, the Londie Music and War Program, which plays 24 hours a day,

01:33:39.320 --> 01:33:40.320
7 days a week.

01:33:40.320 --> 01:33:43.800
So basically, we're going to play three songs to vote for your favorite, that's how it works.

01:33:43.800 --> 01:33:47.320
It's totally you guys, you guys get control, and I know we have new listeners tonight.

01:33:47.320 --> 01:33:49.200
Only votes for Loki count.

01:33:49.200 --> 01:33:51.520
No, don't tell them that.

01:33:51.520 --> 01:33:56.360
Alright, so you only get to hear a clip of the song that won from last week because you

01:33:56.360 --> 01:33:58.880
already heard it last week even though I know we have new listeners tonight

01:33:58.880 --> 01:34:05.660
thanks to the great Apple we're only playing a clip and I'm so God look you

01:34:05.660 --> 01:34:10.920
are so freaky drunk right now it's not even funny I'm no no no no no he's not I

01:34:10.920 --> 01:34:15.800
have to make him the mother of all dreams remember you cannot vote until

01:34:15.800 --> 01:34:19.640
all three songs to play in their entire Christopher's death because it's

01:34:19.640 --> 01:34:23.280
probably getting messed up from me but here we go keep it clean song number one

01:34:23.280 --> 01:34:27.080
It's last week's winner dark or two weeks ago really because we didn't have a show

01:34:27.680 --> 01:34:31.800
Dark Sakura picked tell the funky homo sapien with dr. Bombay

01:34:31.800 --> 01:34:36.320
It's cuz this one's fucking awesome. So see if you like it. Here's a clip song number one

01:34:36.320 --> 01:34:43.320
one you can vote for tonight, Del the funky homo sapien, Dr. Bombay.

01:35:06.320 --> 01:35:11.320
Just turn on me, you don't stop me, you don't play

01:35:11.320 --> 01:35:14.320
Every time I try to get to me, it's always running away

01:35:16.320 --> 01:35:20.320
Just turn on me, don't you buy diamonds, don't you stay

01:35:20.320 --> 01:35:23.320
I'm just once guaranteed to make my day

01:35:25.320 --> 01:35:27.320
Large as a black woman's duty it's back

01:35:27.320 --> 01:35:30.320
And the question everybody is asking is

01:35:32.320 --> 01:35:34.320
A brother named George, it's a 150 month old

01:35:34.320 --> 01:35:36.320
So let's take it to the stage, you suckers

01:35:36.320 --> 01:35:39.320
I jam, and Mr. Darlene is too much

01:35:39.320 --> 01:35:42.320
Back in the house looking too holly whimsy

01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:44.320
Now you know everything is terrific

01:35:44.320 --> 01:35:47.320
Punk in the 1990s, that's ironic

01:35:47.320 --> 01:35:49.320
So grab you a sack of that chronic

01:35:49.320 --> 01:35:51.320
Down with the links, mind straight from the ghetto

01:35:51.320 --> 01:35:53.320
But I'm under the sun in the meadow

01:35:53.320 --> 01:35:55.320
Me and this Amazon sittin' on my lap

01:35:55.320 --> 01:35:58.320
She bust so big when she walk in clackin'

01:35:58.320 --> 01:36:00.320
Doin' the hoochie coochie and the four shawls

01:36:00.320 --> 01:36:02.320
Know who I am, so girl sing the chorus

01:36:32.320 --> 01:36:44.320
Watch and watch, cause if your spouse calls, your sales gonna jam so it'll make your house

01:36:44.320 --> 01:36:45.320
call.

01:36:45.320 --> 01:36:49.320
Your peeps on my jaws, on your mitts I'm a dog, so you might peep off.

01:36:49.320 --> 01:36:55.320
Wait, it ain't foolin' jock, cause you're real far from a ballerina, so.

01:36:55.320 --> 01:36:59.320
Mr. Diamantina, freeze, and get up off your knees.

01:36:59.320 --> 01:37:11.320
I like clubmen hangin' out with the men, and girl, if you ain't got a germ, I won't hesitate

01:37:11.320 --> 01:37:13.320
to pull out my funky rhymes.

01:37:13.320 --> 01:37:17.320
But if you ain't down for jump on, cancel your appointment and please get the hell on,

01:37:17.320 --> 01:37:20.320
cause I won't have one lit rose under my nose.

01:37:20.320 --> 01:37:25.320
If you want eighty pieces of clothes, get out my way so I can save the day, cause I'm

01:37:25.320 --> 01:37:55.300
Cause I'm Dr. Rob

01:37:55.300 --> 01:38:24.300
I don't even know if I flushed, I was so drunk, no I did, I did kiss, I'm sanitary.

01:38:24.300 --> 01:38:28.300
Alright, um, so it's Delta Funky Homosapien with Dr. Bombay.

01:38:28.300 --> 01:38:30.300
Uh, so see if you like that one.

01:38:30.300 --> 01:38:33.300
Here's song number two. Song number two tonight is my pick.

01:38:33.300 --> 01:38:36.300
And you might remember last week we announced, or no, two weeks ago,

01:38:36.300 --> 01:38:38.300
maybe it was three, I don't even know at this point,

01:38:38.300 --> 01:38:40.300
we announced a brand new song for DDR UltraMix 3.

01:38:40.300 --> 01:38:42.300
I'm sorry, we played a new song.

01:38:42.300 --> 01:38:44.300
It was previously announced on, on DDR Freak Forum.

01:38:44.300 --> 01:38:46.300
So we played it for the first time.

01:38:46.300 --> 01:38:48.300
It was a band called The Azoic.

01:38:48.300 --> 01:38:50.300
And I've been a fan of The Azoic for several months now,

01:38:50.300 --> 01:38:52.300
before they were ever announced for UltraMix 3. What?

01:38:52.300 --> 01:38:57.900
your eyes are wide you look like freaking frodo it's awesome um so i i wanted to play another

01:39:04.700 --> 01:39:09.180
all right um so i wanted to play an azoic song for you guys because it's kind of gothic i like it i

01:39:09.180 --> 01:39:13.020

01:39:19.420 --> 01:39:45.340
You tried to get to me, crawled inside of me, but now I'm purging out the pain to stay

01:39:45.340 --> 01:39:46.340
free.

01:39:46.340 --> 01:39:49.340
Purging out the pain to stay free

01:39:49.340 --> 01:39:51.340
Don't you believe they died?

01:39:51.340 --> 01:39:52.340
Sweet sanctity taking

01:39:52.340 --> 01:39:55.340
What's left of me, how condescending

01:40:25.340 --> 01:40:43.340
I thought you should know that I, except I throw it in, now I'm leaving, don't you know?

01:40:43.340 --> 01:40:50.340
I'm, I'm losing you and I, I feel free and you, can't take my strength away, no way

01:40:50.340 --> 01:40:53.680
And then the city's gonna be full inside of me

01:40:53.680 --> 01:40:56.840
But now I'm cruising in the thing you say

01:40:56.840 --> 01:40:59.540
And the truth is, from this day to day night

01:40:59.540 --> 01:41:01.340
Sweet things that you've been thinking

01:41:01.340 --> 01:41:04.140
Are left to me condescending

01:41:04.140 --> 01:41:08.840
Do you think you can get to me?

01:41:08.840 --> 01:41:12.340
Let me tell you something

01:41:12.340 --> 01:41:17.840
I won't be pushed around, no

01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:31.840
If my life aren't fair enough to give up that easy, you better not break me down

01:42:47.840 --> 01:42:51.080
You're here for the future and there's no holding back

01:42:51.080 --> 01:42:54.480
My hopes and dreams are set for perfect light

01:42:54.480 --> 01:42:57.840
I miss you from your birth, they're very sweet for you

01:42:57.840 --> 01:43:01.280
But you know that I've been my source of time

01:43:01.280 --> 01:43:04.720
You'll take this very home and you will feel it all

01:43:04.720 --> 01:43:07.600
How you bring all the strength within me

01:43:07.600 --> 01:43:12.320
So you think you can get to me

01:43:12.320 --> 01:43:15.840
Then let me tell you something

01:43:15.840 --> 01:43:21.340
And I won't be pushed around, no

01:43:22.840 --> 01:43:25.840
If my life are fair enough

01:43:26.340 --> 01:43:29.340
To give up that easy

01:43:29.840 --> 01:43:34.840
Can I break me down?

01:43:35.840 --> 01:43:37.840
Take my feet

01:44:07.840 --> 01:44:19.840
Song number two, the Azoic. Let me tell you something. And let me tell you, I don't know if these two heard much of that song, but they'll give it a rating anyway. Dark Sakura.

01:44:19.840 --> 01:44:23.840
It's the same fucking stuff you always pick.

01:44:23.840 --> 01:44:26.840
I don't, I think you're wrong. I think it's different.

01:44:26.840 --> 01:44:32.840
Cindy Boyce, Cindy Boyce, and Tramp. Over generic beats, Tramp.

01:44:32.840 --> 01:44:35.840
I think if you put that side by side with my previous picks, the song's very different.

01:44:35.840 --> 01:44:38.200
especially okay and i give it a seven

01:44:38.200 --> 01:44:39.120
loki

01:44:39.120 --> 01:44:40.640
she's wanted to make fun of me

01:44:40.640 --> 01:44:42.240
i'll give it a

01:44:42.240 --> 01:44:44.680
nine because

01:44:44.680 --> 01:44:49.600
i wasn't here to listen to it but it sounds great

01:44:49.600 --> 01:44:51.800
this is the drunkest i've ever seen loki

01:44:51.800 --> 01:44:52.880
i'm gonna make him drunk

01:44:52.880 --> 01:44:55.280
i could have played britney spears and i would have got a nine

01:44:55.280 --> 01:44:57.560
i didn't even know what the hell you played

01:44:57.560 --> 01:44:59.640
it's gonna get a nine though

01:44:59.640 --> 01:45:01.040
it's the azoic let me tell you something

01:45:01.040 --> 01:45:04.120
azoic is good i was listening to the different drum stuff

01:45:04.120 --> 01:45:06.840
earlier today when I was trying to find something to play

01:45:06.840 --> 01:45:07.880
but um...

01:45:07.880 --> 01:45:09.040
Azoic is good

01:45:09.040 --> 01:45:11.900
so I'll give you a nine, cause Azoic rocks

01:45:11.900 --> 01:45:14.400
and I give that song a leaveny billion

01:45:14.400 --> 01:45:15.600
because the song is awesome

01:45:15.600 --> 01:45:18.200
I second that, a leaveny billion is good

01:45:18.200 --> 01:45:20.160
a leaveny billion for the Azoic

01:45:20.160 --> 01:45:21.320
a leaveny billion

01:45:21.320 --> 01:45:25.880
honestly, Azoic needs more stuff, there's actually, there's another group that I need

01:45:25.880 --> 01:45:28.520
um... music from, but they only had

01:45:28.520 --> 01:45:34.100
one million samplers on their site and it begins with an E, but I can't remember the goddamn name of the...

01:45:34.100 --> 01:45:36.500
stupid band

01:45:36.500 --> 01:45:37.540
emo

01:45:37.540 --> 01:45:41.100
no it's not emo it's uh...

01:45:41.100 --> 01:45:42.500
something else who cares

01:45:42.500 --> 01:45:46.060
song number three your pick what'd you pick for us loki

01:45:46.060 --> 01:45:48.660
something from every little thing

01:45:48.660 --> 01:45:51.580
is from elt trance

01:45:51.580 --> 01:45:55.780
i can't remember what they got here it's called feel my heart the moog wye remix

01:45:55.780 --> 01:46:01.540
yeah feel my heart moog wye remix and it was just kind of cool sounding from what i had

01:46:01.540 --> 01:46:08.540
I had another ELT trance song that was kind of rock sounding but it wasn't good enough

01:46:08.540 --> 01:46:15.060
so I picked this one and honestly right now I am in no condition to say how good the song

01:46:15.060 --> 01:46:21.580
was but I think it was pretty good so take a listen and enjoy.

01:46:21.580 --> 01:46:28.580
I might throw up, this isn't good. Alright here we go, song number three every little thing.

01:48:21.580 --> 01:48:23.580
Oh

01:49:51.580 --> 01:49:53.580
You

01:50:21.580 --> 01:50:31.580
Song number 3 in tonight's cage match, Every Little Thing, Feel My Heart, the Mugwai remix.

01:50:31.580 --> 01:50:37.580
Let's see what our people in the room thought about Every Little Thing, Feel My Heart.

01:50:37.580 --> 01:50:39.580
Dark Sakura, Every Little Thing.

01:50:39.580 --> 01:50:40.580
Two.

01:50:40.580 --> 01:50:41.580
Why is that?

01:50:41.580 --> 01:50:43.580
Because it sucks.

01:50:43.580 --> 01:50:44.580
Alright.

01:50:44.580 --> 01:50:45.580
Tuka's it sucks.

01:50:45.580 --> 01:50:46.580
Loki.

01:50:46.580 --> 01:50:57.580
I give it a, um, I don't know, a five? I don't really know because I wasn't listening to it because I was drunk.

01:50:58.580 --> 01:51:06.580
Um, the parts I heard sound neat, but you guys are giving it really low scores. I would have given it a low score.

01:51:06.580 --> 01:51:07.580
It was a pretty good song.

01:51:07.580 --> 01:51:08.580
You know, I'll add it together.

01:51:08.580 --> 01:51:14.580
I liked it when I originally picked it out when I was sober, and it was good, okay? That was pretty good.

01:51:14.580 --> 01:51:19.580
The original song I had picked out wasn't quite as good, so I'll give it an 8.

01:51:19.580 --> 01:51:29.080
But, um, right now, you could play it like, you know, a cat in heat, you know, a sound effect of that, and I would probably give it a 10.

01:51:29.080 --> 01:51:29.580
Right.

01:51:29.580 --> 01:51:31.080
Cause I'm just so gone.

01:51:31.080 --> 01:51:36.080
Well, I'll combine 2 plus 5 and give it a 7, cause I kinda don't like this. It's okay.

01:51:36.080 --> 01:51:39.580
Alright, let's listen to three songs you can vote for tonight.

01:51:39.580 --> 01:51:42.580
Uh, here it is. Song number one you can vote for tonight.

01:51:42.580 --> 01:51:44.260
Del the Funky Homosapien.

01:51:44.260 --> 01:51:45.940
We played three songs already?

01:51:45.940 --> 01:51:47.060
Yeah, it's already done.

01:51:47.060 --> 01:51:49.220
Del the Funky Homosapien, Dr. Bombay.

01:51:57.220 --> 01:51:58.980
Every time I hear that song, I can't help but think,

01:51:58.980 --> 01:52:01.540
check and turn, and send it to the ladder.

01:52:01.540 --> 01:52:03.300
Here it is, song number two tonight.

01:52:03.300 --> 01:52:10.300
Ezoic, let me tell you something.

01:52:13.140 --> 01:52:16.700
And song number three you can vote for tonight, Every Little Thing,

01:52:16.700 --> 01:52:23.220
Feel My Heart, the Moog Wire remix.

01:52:23.220 --> 01:52:27.460
I hope they're not gonna get me out of here tonight.

01:52:27.460 --> 01:52:33.060
Place vote now. Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote

01:52:33.060 --> 01:52:36.060
And we'll tally them up, and hopefully I can keep count tonight.

01:52:36.060 --> 01:52:44.060
Um, we'll tally them up. Please don't post a vote publicly, because I don't see those as easily, and then I don't, I don't, um, tabulate it.

01:52:44.060 --> 01:52:47.060
And that's no fun at all, when I can't tabulate your vote.

01:52:47.060 --> 01:52:50.060
So, how's it going there, Sky?

01:52:50.060 --> 01:52:54.060
I'm, I'm feeling okay, I'm just, I'm a little...

01:52:54.060 --> 01:53:02.060
I have no sense of balance right now, and I'm pretty drunk, I think.

01:53:02.060 --> 01:53:09.400
Yeah, me too. I'm I'm pretty out of it. I I can't focus on you right now man cuz you're all over the place

01:53:11.900 --> 01:53:13.140
And

01:53:13.140 --> 01:53:18.600
Yeah, I think my family stopped listening. So that's good. It's probably a good that's probably a good thing

01:53:18.600 --> 01:53:21.620
And I'm sure I'll get much crap for it tomorrow

01:53:21.780 --> 01:53:28.540
But you know what? I don't care because I'm having a barbecue and it's free food and you know what?

01:53:29.180 --> 01:53:31.180
That's all good. Oh

01:53:31.180 --> 01:53:36.180
Oh, I am so dizzy right now.

01:53:36.180 --> 01:53:39.180
I know, I honestly am at the point where I'm like, what do I do with the rest of the show?

01:53:39.180 --> 01:53:44.180
Like, I could literally run into the wall and I wouldn't feel it because I'm so numb right now.

01:53:44.180 --> 01:53:47.180
I was hugging the corner earlier, I don't know why, it just felt very comfortable.

01:53:47.180 --> 01:53:51.180
My head rested very well in the corner, it was very interesting.

01:53:51.180 --> 01:53:53.180
Yeah, I saw that, I saw that.

01:53:53.180 --> 01:53:57.180
And people were saying, you know what, you're so drunk.

01:53:57.180 --> 01:54:09.180
Honestly, folks, I am pretty drunk, but I am still pretty coherent. I just have no sense of balance whatsoever right now in most of my...

01:54:09.180 --> 01:54:13.180
Well, we're getting feedback, but we're going to try and take this call. Hi, you're on Orange House Radio.

01:54:13.180 --> 01:54:16.180
Sorry about that. Sorry about that. Can you hear me now?

01:54:16.180 --> 01:54:17.180
Yes.

01:54:17.180 --> 01:54:20.180
It's DeepFell42. Sorry about that earlier.

01:54:20.180 --> 01:54:25.180
That's all right. What's on your mind? We're hearing a bad echo, so I'm just going to give you a minute to put out your thoughts.

01:54:25.180 --> 01:54:31.180
That was because I forgot to turn my iTunes volume down, so that was the main reason of that.

01:54:31.180 --> 01:54:33.180
What's on your mind?

01:54:33.180 --> 01:54:42.180
No, I just wanted to let you guys know that if you go to KevinPereira.com, I wanted to let you know how to vote for you guys for Attack of the Show.

She went to the bathroom, because she doesn't think she looks good, but she does.

01:58:00.780 --> 01:58:02.780
Why? She looks incredible!

01:58:02.780 --> 01:58:03.780

01:58:03.780 --> 01:58:07.780

01:58:15.780 --> 01:58:16.780
I think I need a drink.

01:58:16.780 --> 01:58:18.780
No, you better not have any more drinks. Alright.

01:58:18.780 --> 01:58:22.780

I'm spinning me in circles You're playing moonlight with my heart

01:59:45.280 --> 01:59:52.280

02:02:14.280 --> 02:02:20.280
Put down on pedal I got pedal to the metal

02:02:20.280 --> 02:02:24.280
Roll down the highway just like a fire ball

02:02:24.280 --> 02:02:28.280
Time rockin' steel, don't stop the fire wall burnin' out of control

02:02:28.280 --> 02:02:33.280
Get those nanos on the sidewalk with the sky like rock and roll

02:02:35.280 --> 02:02:37.280
Get hot

02:02:37.280 --> 02:03:00.280
Kick it in my dress with your nuclear fishes made of a rose

02:03:00.280 --> 02:03:04.280
I need a guy to feed a fly ball for an hour to go

02:03:04.280 --> 02:03:08.280
My head is still feeling very wet, but daddy's getting on a roll

02:03:08.280 --> 02:03:12.280

And I was younger, I wasn't free

02:03:55.280 --> 02:03:58.280
All I wanted was attention

02:03:58.280 --> 02:04:02.280
Party after party, beauty and money

02:04:02.280 --> 02:04:05.280
We were so desperate for perfection

02:04:05.280 --> 02:04:09.280
But you have made me feel so good

02:04:09.280 --> 02:04:12.280
I've always been closer to you

02:04:12.280 --> 02:04:16.280
I close my eyes in your arms

02:04:16.280 --> 02:04:18.280
Life is simple again

02:04:18.280 --> 02:04:21.280
With you, don't you know, don't you know

02:04:21.280 --> 02:04:24.280

02:04:47.580 --> 02:04:50.240

02:04:57.200 --> 02:05:00.460
Last week on Orange Lounge Radio

02:05:00.460 --> 02:05:05.100
Next week on the show, we're going to have our very first special guest.

02:05:05.100 --> 02:05:10.700
We're actually having over Melody and Mel B, and they're going to be our guests on the show,

02:05:10.700 --> 02:05:13.820
and I get to clean house all week to be ready for them.

02:05:14.940 --> 02:05:17.340
Oh God, I have to move everything out and deliver them,

02:05:17.340 --> 02:05:20.060
because this room's crap as it is when we do the show here, so...

02:05:20.060 --> 02:05:22.620
I have to say so, and they're quite trusty and moist.

02:05:23.740 --> 02:05:25.500
Are you feeling a little moist tonight, Jamie?

02:05:25.500 --> 02:05:33.000
Oh, every night on the show, as Irene makes his face.

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:36.140
Orange Lounge Radio makes a moistest snack.

02:05:36.140 --> 02:05:42.580
Join us every Sunday night from 7 p.m. until 9 p.m. Pacific Standard Time for the Orange

02:05:42.580 --> 02:05:49.180
Lounge, with your hosts, Dark Sakura and Sky, where we'll talk about all things Bomani and

02:05:49.180 --> 02:05:50.180
then some.

02:05:50.180 --> 02:05:54.780
In the meantime, enjoy our Bomani Music and More program.

02:05:54.780 --> 02:06:00.080
another flashback there an old episode I don't know it's like episode five or

02:06:00.080 --> 02:06:04.380
something I don't know it's old it's hecka old we're back here on orange

02:06:04.380 --> 02:06:11.160
lounge radio and been doing a little bit of drinking and I I'm cut off now and I

02:06:11.160 --> 02:06:15.500
think Loki is is stuck with water now and dark Sakura I would love the chat

02:06:15.500 --> 02:06:18.940
room forever if they tell me how to take those damn ink tags off my clothes

02:06:18.940 --> 02:06:24.100
that's a bunch of crap I can hot topic fucked up I can never figure out how you

02:06:24.100 --> 02:06:29.260
you were able to get out of Hot Topic with the tag on, because wouldn't it have beep-beep-beeped?

02:06:29.260 --> 02:06:30.260
Should have, logically.

02:06:30.260 --> 02:06:31.260
But you know what?

02:06:31.260 --> 02:06:32.900
But now you know how to steal clothes.

02:06:32.900 --> 02:06:36.660
And maybe you should, just to teach them a lesson.

02:06:36.660 --> 02:06:37.660
No.

02:06:37.660 --> 02:06:38.660
Alright.

02:06:38.660 --> 02:06:39.660
Um.

02:06:39.660 --> 02:06:40.660
Dark soccer.

02:06:40.660 --> 02:06:41.660
This is magnetic.

02:06:41.660 --> 02:06:44.820
Dark soccer is sounding a little angsty to me, so I think we need to get in the FUs of

02:06:44.820 --> 02:06:45.820
the week.

02:06:45.820 --> 02:06:49.300
However, I do want to announce tonight's cage match winner, but we didn't have a lot of

02:06:49.300 --> 02:06:51.940
votes in tonight's cage match, which makes me a sad panda.

02:06:51.940 --> 02:06:53.860
Doesn't that make you sad a little bit?

02:06:53.860 --> 02:06:58.580
But we do have a winner nonetheless because even if there's one vote, one vote is enough

02:06:58.580 --> 02:06:59.580
to declare the cage match.

02:06:59.580 --> 02:07:03.820
So here is tonight's cage match wiener.

02:07:03.820 --> 02:07:08.820
The wiener is the Azoic.

02:07:08.820 --> 02:07:15.340
Let me tell you something, by one vote, one vote for the Azoic wins tonight's cage match.

02:07:15.340 --> 02:07:17.460
Good job boys and girls.

02:07:17.460 --> 02:07:21.340
All right.

02:07:21.340 --> 02:07:26.340
Dark Soccer, I think you're wanting to get your angst on, aren't you?

02:07:26.340 --> 02:07:27.340
Please.

02:07:27.340 --> 02:07:28.340
Alright.

02:07:28.340 --> 02:07:34.500
Hold on, I'm having a hard time locating the F.U. music right now.

02:07:34.500 --> 02:07:35.500
You're still this song?

02:07:35.500 --> 02:07:36.500
Yeah, you're this song.

02:07:36.500 --> 02:07:37.500
Okay.

02:07:37.500 --> 02:07:40.540
Dark Soccer, why is it we do the F.U.s every single week?

02:07:40.540 --> 02:07:42.540
Because Hot Topic sucks.

02:07:42.540 --> 02:07:59.540
So now I have to find something to wrap the ink tag in while I cut the wire, that's all.

02:07:59.540 --> 02:08:01.540
That's it?

02:08:01.540 --> 02:08:03.540
That's it.

02:08:03.540 --> 02:08:05.540
Okay.

02:08:05.540 --> 02:08:09.540
Hold on, I gotta find Loki's music here. Here it is!

02:08:09.540 --> 02:08:11.540
Loki, your turn!

02:08:11.540 --> 02:08:14.540
Chat room, you can send in your refuse right now if you want.

02:08:14.540 --> 02:08:16.540
Loki, here you go, your turn.

02:08:16.540 --> 02:08:22.540
The only thing I'm really mad about is how drunk I am,

02:08:22.540 --> 02:08:25.540
because I felt like I was going to throw up something in the bathroom,

02:08:25.540 --> 02:08:34.780
the bathroom but I didn't thank God I'm not that drunk yet so just F you to how

02:08:34.780 --> 02:08:43.780
drunk I am and fuck you to destroy all home it's been such a short game and

02:08:43.780 --> 02:08:52.900
that's it all right continue with whoever else you can cut in the bathtub

02:08:52.900 --> 02:09:01.860
just in case okay i'm fine just very dizzy are you okay are you gonna pass out no i'm fine

02:09:02.980 --> 02:09:09.700
i felt like i was gonna throw up earlier but i didn't so i was good you know angsty i'm very

02:09:09.700 --> 02:09:15.700
I'm very drunk. I don't have the energy to be angsty. So, it's good.

02:09:32.700 --> 02:09:38.700
I can't find my song. That's why I'm stalling. Are you sure you don't have anything else?

02:09:38.700 --> 02:09:44.820
yeah I'm pretty sure the other thing I have is why the hell did my family

02:09:44.820 --> 02:09:51.260
decide to listen to this show now when I'm drunk instead of like normally when

02:09:51.260 --> 02:09:57.180
I'm doing a normal show I don't understand that kind of stuff but

02:09:57.180 --> 02:10:03.500
whatever you know they know I'm drunk and I know they know I'm not only drunk

02:10:03.500 --> 02:10:04.500
I am so...

02:10:04.500 --> 02:10:10.260
I am way wasted right now.

02:10:10.260 --> 02:10:15.860
I am so dizzy it's not even funny.

02:10:15.860 --> 02:10:16.860
Monomena.

02:10:16.860 --> 02:10:17.860
Monomena.

02:10:17.860 --> 02:10:18.860
Any luck?

02:10:18.860 --> 02:10:32.100
I can't even see you people because you're so damn drunk.

02:10:32.100 --> 02:10:37.100
kostjamrh The chat room is noticing how slow your speech got all of a sudden. How many drinks did you have again?

02:10:37.100 --> 02:10:42.100
p0k3smot42o I think it's empty

02:10:47.100 --> 02:10:52.100
p0k3smot42o Oh my god, my turn

02:10:52.100 --> 02:11:04.300
Um, I'm giving you an F.U. to the motherfucker who broke into my car for the second time

02:11:04.300 --> 02:11:05.300
nonetheless.

02:11:05.300 --> 02:11:09.380
Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me, I hate you.

02:11:09.380 --> 02:11:10.720
Why did you have to do that to me?

02:11:10.720 --> 02:11:16.460
I am a nice guy, a nice guy should not have the car broken into and just F.U. to the fact

02:11:16.460 --> 02:11:19.860
I didn't have a car alarm but I shouldn't have to get an alarm because people should

02:11:19.860 --> 02:11:24.660
the common fucking decency not to break into your shit. I hope you enjoy the stereo, I

02:11:24.660 --> 02:11:29.140
hope it blows up on you, and I hope you get gonorrhea and die of SARS, because you're

02:11:29.140 --> 02:11:33.740
just an asshole who steals things from people, who steal things that aren't yours. And now

02:11:33.740 --> 02:11:37.020
I'm gonna have to rent a garage because of you, and that's $70 a month I'm out of the

02:11:37.020 --> 02:11:41.620
money, because you can't keep your hands off my shit. Keep your hands off my shit, you

02:11:41.620 --> 02:11:53.060
shit-eater and yeah an F you to that all right let's go to the chat room at use

02:11:55.020 --> 02:12:00.380
dark knight says my F you is going to be for my job to have me work on the fourth

02:12:00.380 --> 02:12:10.100
bitches dark knight says if it's a certain tag all you need to do is pinch

02:12:10.100 --> 02:12:17.060
one of the tags so get like a pair of pliers okay the way that this one is

02:12:17.060 --> 02:12:23.460
it's got the clear tag with the blue ink and the yellow ink you can see through

02:12:23.460 --> 02:12:28.100
the tag the other side has a long part that's attached to a more cylindrical

02:12:28.100 --> 02:12:33.900
looking part with a domed end you can see a thin wire connecting the two what

02:12:33.900 --> 02:12:37.940
I am concerned about is that without having anything to wrap it in if I cut

02:12:37.940 --> 02:12:41.920
the wire because it is magnetically charged at the point it senses the magnetic

02:12:41.920 --> 02:12:48.920
destruction it will explode the ink. I have nothing to wrap it in. So yeah, find me a way around that.

02:12:53.920 --> 02:12:56.920
Illusion says F you to Loki in his slurred speech.

02:12:56.920 --> 02:13:10.360

02:14:04.380 --> 02:14:11.020
Illusion says F you to my target interviews sucking and me being pretty sure I didn't get the job

02:14:11.020 --> 02:14:19.660
Vidpalette says, F you to homework over holiday weekends and F you to my DVD case being cracked

02:14:19.660 --> 02:14:21.860
in the mail.

02:14:21.860 --> 02:14:26.380
And DeepThought42 says, F you to the Hillary Clinton for saying that video games are to

02:14:26.380 --> 02:14:28.780
blame for your kids' sociopathic behavior.

02:14:28.780 --> 02:14:31.700
It's your fucking parents' fault!

02:14:31.700 --> 02:14:33.700
Damn straight.

02:14:33.700 --> 02:14:38.780
And that's it.

02:14:38.780 --> 02:14:40.540
That's our chatters F yous.

02:14:40.540 --> 02:15:04.540
I can entertain people, I'm sober.

02:15:04.540 --> 02:15:08.580
Nellie, what do you want to do to entertain our listeners?

02:15:08.580 --> 02:15:09.660
I don't know.

02:15:09.660 --> 02:15:13.820
Let's hear some Mets wisdom, Mets drunken wisdom.

02:15:13.820 --> 02:15:16.320
Burp.

02:15:16.320 --> 02:15:19.500
I'm so tired.

02:15:19.500 --> 02:15:23.100
Oh, a deep thought.

02:15:23.100 --> 02:15:24.020
42 had another one.

02:15:24.020 --> 02:15:26.140
F you to my fucking computer for causing

02:15:26.140 --> 02:15:28.660
that fucking echo on the air.

02:15:28.660 --> 02:15:31.180
Amen.

02:15:31.180 --> 02:15:32.140
Where did X Defer go?

02:15:32.140 --> 02:15:34.020
Don't kick him in the butt when he's passed out.

02:15:34.020 --> 02:15:36.020
I kick him in the butt all the time.

02:15:36.020 --> 02:15:37.520
At least I didn't kick him in the balls.

02:15:37.520 --> 02:15:41.520
I'm going to pass on the third.

02:15:41.520 --> 02:15:43.020
Don't fall asleep.

02:15:43.020 --> 02:15:44.520
I'm not falling asleep.

02:15:44.520 --> 02:15:45.020
X.

02:15:45.020 --> 02:15:45.520
I'm tired.

02:15:45.520 --> 02:15:47.520
My stomach is fucking full.

02:15:47.520 --> 02:15:50.520
I really don't know what to do with the show at this point.

02:15:50.520 --> 02:15:53.020
Let's go to a break.

02:15:53.020 --> 02:15:56.520
That's always a good thing to do when the show is going crazy.

02:15:56.520 --> 02:16:00.520
My stomach is full of alcohol.

02:16:00.520 --> 02:16:06.520
We're going to give Loki some time to cheer up.

02:16:06.520 --> 02:16:08.520
DarkSakura, you said you wanted to hear something earlier.

02:16:08.520 --> 02:16:09.520
What do you want to hear?

02:16:09.520 --> 02:16:10.520
I forgot.

02:16:10.520 --> 02:16:13.520
Well, anything off the top of your head?

02:16:13.520 --> 02:16:14.520
Taku.

02:16:14.520 --> 02:16:15.520
Taku.

02:16:15.520 --> 02:16:18.520
Voltage by the one and only Taku.

02:16:18.520 --> 02:16:19.520
How's that?

02:16:19.520 --> 02:16:20.520
It works.

02:16:20.520 --> 02:16:21.520
Alright.

02:16:21.520 --> 02:16:22.520
Some 2DX done.

02:16:22.520 --> 02:16:23.520
We'll do a 2DX break.

02:16:23.520 --> 02:16:26.520
We'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.

02:16:26.520 --> 02:16:27.520
Maybe some Ask Orange Lounge.

02:16:27.520 --> 02:16:28.520
Whatever we can come up with.

02:16:28.520 --> 02:16:29.520
We'll be back.

02:18:59.520 --> 02:19:01.520
I wish that I was you

02:19:04.520 --> 02:19:07.520
I wish that I was me

02:20:07.520 --> 02:20:09.520
Red! Red! Blue! Wild!

02:20:10.520 --> 02:20:13.520
Red! Red! Blue! Wild!

02:21:13.520 --> 02:21:29.520
I am a young punk, yeah, a punk for the bad guys

02:21:29.520 --> 02:21:36.520
I'm a young punk, yeah, all right, yeah

02:21:36.520 --> 02:21:40.520
You've got to keep a heart of steel,

02:21:40.520 --> 02:21:43.520
Call it who the fuck is the seal,

02:21:43.520 --> 02:21:46.520
Call it who the fuck is the seal,

02:21:46.520 --> 02:21:49.520
or die.

02:21:49.520 --> 02:21:51.520
I can't lie, I'm the killer,

02:21:51.520 --> 02:21:56.520
I am the sickest guy.

02:21:56.520 --> 02:21:58.520
I can't lie, I'm the killer,

02:21:58.520 --> 02:22:03.520
I am the sickest guy.

02:23:03.520 --> 02:23:18.120
I've seen those videos of, like, the guys playing all the stuff one-handed.

02:23:18.120 --> 02:23:22.080
It's got to be the most demoralizing bit of footage you could ever watch for 2DX.

02:23:22.080 --> 02:23:23.080
For the people who don't know...

02:23:23.080 --> 02:23:26.760
Those videos just scream, Americans suck at 2DX.

02:23:26.760 --> 02:23:30.960
For the people who don't know what ketsujin means, it means Iron Man.

02:23:30.960 --> 02:23:32.320
It's named that for a reason.

02:23:32.320 --> 02:23:36.320
You know, those are some absolutely fantastic players.

02:23:36.320 --> 02:23:40.320
It's like, is that trying to spin off on Iron Chef, like Iron 2DX?

02:23:40.320 --> 02:23:44.320
I don't know, it's like, you know, like Tekken for 2DX.

02:23:44.320 --> 02:23:47.320
You know, the king of iron fingering.

02:23:47.320 --> 02:23:49.320
Whoa!

02:23:49.320 --> 02:23:50.320
Never mind, I said another...

02:23:50.320 --> 02:23:53.320
Remember that part about adult content?

02:23:53.320 --> 02:24:00.320
Um, I was referring to this in a completely innocent manner, you pervert.

02:24:00.320 --> 02:24:05.080
I think we know what our last week on Orange Lounge clip will be.

02:24:05.080 --> 02:24:06.440
OK, you can bite me now.

02:24:06.440 --> 02:24:12.200
Join us every Sunday night from 7 PM until 9 PM Pacific Standard Time

02:24:12.200 --> 02:24:17.120
for the Orange Lounge with your hosts, Dark Sakura and Skye,

02:24:17.120 --> 02:24:20.720
where we'll talk about all things Bomani and Densim.

02:24:20.720 --> 02:24:24.240
In the meantime, enjoy our Bomani music and more program.

02:24:24.240 --> 02:24:29.240
Another classic bite there.

02:24:29.240 --> 02:24:33.240
Yes!

02:24:33.240 --> 02:24:41.240
We just had an incident in the studio, so we needed to do one more song, guys, and we'll explain what's going on when we come back.

02:24:41.240 --> 02:24:46.240
I gotta run and get something real quick. We'll explain what's going on when we come back.

02:24:46.240 --> 02:24:51.240
How are you doing over there, DarkSakura?

02:24:51.240 --> 02:24:53.240
I'm almost sober again.

02:24:54.240 --> 02:24:57.240
You know my tolerance, and you know how fucking much it takes me.

02:24:57.240 --> 02:25:00.240
What just happened surprisingly sobered me up, especially.

02:25:00.240 --> 02:25:01.240
So we'll be back right after this.

02:25:01.240 --> 02:25:03.240
I just sat here going, wow.

02:25:03.240 --> 02:25:08.240
We'll be back right after this song from Xtreme USA with more Orange Lounge.

02:25:33.240 --> 02:25:37.240
Love, yeah

02:25:37.240 --> 02:25:39.240
I never felt a major change

02:25:39.240 --> 02:25:40.240
But I swear

02:25:40.240 --> 02:25:42.240
A thousand years and countless days

02:25:42.240 --> 02:25:44.240
So give me a lay

02:25:44.240 --> 02:25:46.240
So give me a little talk

02:25:46.240 --> 02:25:50.240
My prayers are for love, love

02:25:50.240 --> 02:25:53.240
Love, love, love

02:25:53.240 --> 02:25:55.240
Some may be love

02:25:55.240 --> 02:25:57.240
Love, love

02:25:57.240 --> 02:26:00.240
Some may be love, love, love

02:26:28.240 --> 02:26:29.240

02:26:29.240 --> 02:26:32.240
Simply being loved

02:26:32.240 --> 02:26:36.240
Is more than enough

02:26:36.240 --> 02:26:39.240
Simply being loved

02:26:39.240 --> 02:26:43.240
Is more than enough

02:26:43.240 --> 02:26:46.240
Simply being loved

02:26:46.240 --> 02:26:49.240
Is more than enough

02:26:49.240 --> 02:26:51.240
Alright, we're back here on Orange Lounge Radio

02:26:51.240 --> 02:26:55.240
That was BT, Simply Being Loved

02:26:55.240 --> 02:27:02.440
yeah so um gosh how do we explain this um basically what happened during the

02:27:02.440 --> 02:27:07.900
last break there he puked yeah basically low-key parked on his pants he didn't

02:27:07.900 --> 02:27:13.000
quite make it to the toilet he just kind of sat there oh and then suddenly he was

02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:18.280
like I have an announcement bleh so we're not sure we there's one more spot

02:27:18.280 --> 02:27:22.120
that needs to be wiped up too so I'm thinking the same the carpet I hope not

02:27:22.120 --> 02:27:26.840
so he's he's being addressed by Nellie right now surprisingly that sobered me

02:27:26.840 --> 02:27:31.740
up to have that happen I've been sitting here sober for the past 10 15 minutes

02:27:31.740 --> 02:27:39.340
no we're not really sure I'm wearing my skirt with the tag tonight I think go

02:27:39.340 --> 02:27:44.020
for it fucking be hot if it kills me you can't you can't even notice it super

02:27:44.020 --> 02:27:49.400
fine all right so we don't really know what to do with the rest of the show

02:27:49.400 --> 02:27:53.240
here because Loki's kind of gone now I think really see he'll be out for a few

02:27:53.240 --> 02:27:57.180
more minutes at least we saw the podcast we got to do after this I don't know

02:27:57.180 --> 02:28:03.020
what we're gonna do the final drink count what is tonight's final drink out

02:28:03.020 --> 02:28:09.180
how much did you have to drink dark Sakura ten shots I think I I finished

02:28:09.180 --> 02:28:11.980
off with the nine because I had eight shots in Malibu and then a Guinness

02:28:11.980 --> 02:28:16.900
which counts as one shot shots but he puked look yet how much 10 10 but he

02:28:16.900 --> 02:28:18.580
I'm sober

02:28:18.580 --> 02:28:20.260
If I had had one more shot

02:28:20.260 --> 02:28:23.340
I probably would have puked because I was at that point where I was like I'm gonna barf

02:28:23.340 --> 02:28:26.220
But I didn't I got silly and then I'm okay

02:28:30.040 --> 02:28:36.040
Wow, that's the first time that's happened by the way on a drunk show we done in three years of orange lunch radio

02:28:37.740 --> 02:28:42.420
In in the three years of Orange Lounge radio, we've had how many drunk shows about five

02:28:42.420 --> 02:28:49.860
it's probably better. Even when I got really shitfaced, I didn't puke and just ate waffles.

02:28:49.860 --> 02:28:54.220
One of them you passed out in my bed. I didn't pass out. Remember, I was making commentary

02:28:54.220 --> 02:28:59.740
from your bedroom. That's the closest that we've had to a barfing experience. I did not

02:28:59.740 --> 02:29:04.100
pass out, however. Alright. Do you remember I was screaming at you from your bedroom?

02:29:04.100 --> 02:29:09.440
I vaguely felt it. That was the same episode. And then I went, waffle! That was the same

02:29:09.440 --> 02:29:13.920
episode where I was kicking the wall, running up and down, yelling, I'm in the matrix, I'm

02:29:13.920 --> 02:29:19.760
in the matrix. That was great. Did it happen again? Are you okay? I thought you were sober.

02:29:19.760 --> 02:29:24.680
You don't look sober. Loki, can you... Okay, I'm gonna get Loki some cookies. Loki, pick

02:29:24.680 --> 02:29:29.400
up the microphone. Can you pick up the microphone down there? I thought he was sobering up.

02:29:29.400 --> 02:29:34.640
He looks drunker. Hello? Uh-huh. Loki, tell the chatroom how you're feeling. I'm feeling

02:29:34.640 --> 02:29:41.480
incredibly dizzy and I think I just threw up earlier yeah you did cuz you're

02:29:41.480 --> 02:29:47.860
wearing my clothes now might I point out yeah I am I I've drank too much honestly

02:29:47.860 --> 02:29:52.740
normally I drink a lot more water to coincide with my you know drinking

02:29:52.740 --> 02:29:57.820
alcohol so I don't feel like you know I have to eat a cookie I know I'm not

02:29:57.820 --> 02:30:04.620
hungry I can't eat the cookie right now honestly I don't care if you can eat

02:30:04.620 --> 02:30:08.700
Eat it or not, fucking eat the cookie to neutralize the alcohol in your stomach.

02:30:08.700 --> 02:30:10.180
I will be sick, honestly.

02:30:10.180 --> 02:30:11.180
Get a cracker.

02:30:11.180 --> 02:30:12.180
What about me?

02:30:12.180 --> 02:30:13.180
We can.

02:30:13.180 --> 02:30:19.780
Just give me a second to freaking, you know, honestly, to digest this, just give me some

02:30:19.780 --> 02:30:21.740
water and I'll be fine, okay?

02:30:21.740 --> 02:30:28.260
Because if I drink any more, I'm honestly very full right now and I can't drink any

02:30:28.260 --> 02:30:33.220
more, you know, alcohol or anything to be, you know, honest.

02:30:33.220 --> 02:30:41.420
I just, I feel honestly tired as hell, this is why you shouldn't drink folks, I mean honestly,

02:30:41.420 --> 02:30:50.620
cause you'll end up like me, and that's not good, but um, just, just whatever, I mean

02:30:50.620 --> 02:31:00.220
honestly, they got my family stopped listening to this show like long ago, so, it's not good,

02:31:00.220 --> 02:31:11.220
Just don't go crazy with the alcohol and just take it easy, you know, have some fun with the fireworks and whatnot and whatever.

02:31:11.220 --> 02:31:14.220

02:31:14.220 --> 02:31:17.220
Just don't fall asleep and get my computer wet with that water.

02:31:17.220 --> 02:31:24.220
No, I'm not. I'm taking care of the computer because I built this computer so I don't know what it needs, you know.

02:31:24.220 --> 02:31:31.220

02:32:34.340 --> 02:32:36.340
Number 11!

02:32:36.340 --> 02:32:40.340
My lesson from today's episode is drink more water before I start drinking.

02:32:40.340 --> 02:32:42.340
Other than that...

02:32:42.340 --> 02:32:46.340

02:33:58.120 --> 02:34:05.120
get some. When I'm sober, it's not complaining. When there's no puke on his breath. When he

02:34:05.320 --> 02:34:08.520
can get it up. You need a breath mint, Logan? Extra for her, don't you have some breath

02:34:19.240 --> 02:34:23.240

02:34:23.240 --> 02:34:27.240
So what type of drunk am I?

02:34:27.240 --> 02:34:31.240
My nose is numb, okay? My hand is numb.

02:34:31.240 --> 02:34:35.240
So what about my drinking? If Rob gets stupid, what about me?

02:34:35.240 --> 02:34:39.240
See if we can't tell him to open my mouth.

02:34:39.240 --> 02:34:43.240

Who was the last person to put their coin up?

I'm going after that person to hell with the rescue.

02:46:26.040 --> 02:46:28.500
Although I almost got killed by a little kid.

02:46:28.500 --> 02:46:31.940
I think a little four-year-old threatened to cut me at Stockton Golf Line when I got

02:46:31.940 --> 02:46:35.700
up there and said, I'm playing because this person put their token up.

02:46:35.700 --> 02:46:45.740

And then look at his people low-key. Do you have the microphone? Can you have low-key the microphone?

Make sure it's on there. How are you feeling? Are you?

02:47:53.780 --> 02:47:56.980
Yeah, I threw up quite a bit that break

02:47:59.300 --> 02:48:04.740
Just probably because I had a lot of like miss, you know a lot of acid beforehand I

02:48:04.740 --> 02:48:13.740
Um, I was eating a, um, it was runny beforehand, and so that's, you know, a lot of tomato soup, and that's very acidy, so.

02:48:13.740 --> 02:48:18.740
I actually only throw up when I have, um, citrus mixture, so that does make sense.

02:48:18.740 --> 02:48:26.740
I just feel really, you know, wasted right now, and not very tired, and not very good.

02:48:26.740 --> 02:48:33.740
I mean, just, I'm completely out of it, so it's not even funny.

02:48:33.740 --> 02:48:40.440

actually some of them are gonna kick out of it so whatever we only do this once

02:48:59.360 --> 02:49:08.360
This part of the show is for you. This is your chance to take the show in any direction you want to by asking Orange Lounge.

02:49:13.360 --> 02:49:20.360
Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question. What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?

02:49:20.360 --> 02:49:28.360
Will Nellie keep taunting me while I am drunk or will she continue to dance a jig while her boyfriend pukes me?

02:49:31.360 --> 02:49:33.360
Don't you be talking to yourself about me.

02:49:33.360 --> 02:49:37.360
Rob, that's actually the best opening song you have ever done.

02:49:37.360 --> 02:49:39.360
And to think I had to be drunk to improvise that.

02:49:39.360 --> 02:49:43.360
I can't believe that I was actually singing in technical public.

02:49:44.360 --> 02:49:46.360
Cause you know how afraid I am of singing.

02:49:46.360 --> 02:49:52.440
You know, if I just breathe in and out very deeply, I can probably become coherent enough

02:49:52.440 --> 02:49:54.640
to actually answer questions or anything.

02:49:54.640 --> 02:49:58.280
Alright, well this first one's directed towards the one and only DarkSakura, actually.

02:49:58.280 --> 02:49:59.520
I thank God for that.

02:49:59.520 --> 02:50:06.120
The question comes from DeepThought42, and now DeepThoughts with Jack Handy.

02:50:06.120 --> 02:50:07.120
Alright, here it is.

02:50:07.120 --> 02:50:08.120
DarkSakura, are you ready?

02:50:08.120 --> 02:50:10.560
We used to go to the cave to see our Uncle Bear.

02:50:10.560 --> 02:50:14.760
We called him Uncle Bear because he lived in the cave, and sometimes he'd eat one of

02:50:14.760 --> 02:50:15.760
us.

02:50:15.760 --> 02:50:19.760
Later on, we found out he actually was a bear.

02:50:19.760 --> 02:50:23.360
They say that every time an, uh, a, a, what am I, shit.

02:50:23.360 --> 02:50:26.960
The face of the child can say it all, especially the mouse part.

02:50:26.960 --> 02:50:31.760
They say that every time a bell rings, an angel gets its wings, but what they don't

02:50:31.760 --> 02:50:35.760
tell you is, every time a mouse trap snaps, an angel gets set on fire.

02:50:35.760 --> 02:50:36.760
Anyway.

02:50:36.760 --> 02:50:38.760
I love Deep Thought.

02:50:38.760 --> 02:50:43.120
Um, Deep Thought 42, you, you were saying something earlier about how you, when you're

02:50:43.120 --> 02:50:45.560
drinking, you become a big cuddle whore.

02:50:45.560 --> 02:50:49.760
So DeepThought42 wants to know, will Jamie cuddle with me?

02:50:49.760 --> 02:50:52.360
I'd have to ask my fiance.

02:50:52.360 --> 02:50:56.440
And I would imagine that Dark Sacra has the following requirements.

02:50:56.440 --> 02:50:59.120
First of all, you need to have good hygiene, because if you have B.O., she's not going

02:50:59.120 --> 02:51:00.120
to cuddle with you.

02:51:00.120 --> 02:51:01.120
Right.

02:51:01.120 --> 02:51:07.000
And second of all, you have to not be an idiot, because Dark Sacra doesn't cuddle with idiots.

02:51:07.000 --> 02:51:08.280
And you have to have good grammar.

02:51:08.280 --> 02:51:11.480
You are listening to Orange Lawn's radio, which is some plus points there.

02:51:11.480 --> 02:51:13.400
That means that you're not a complete idiot.

02:51:13.400 --> 02:51:14.400
Yes, very good.

02:51:14.400 --> 02:51:20.400
You have to have excellent grammar and great annunciation skills.

02:51:20.400 --> 02:51:21.400
Alright.

02:51:21.400 --> 02:51:23.400
Are those like your turn-ons?

02:51:23.400 --> 02:51:27.400
Oh my god, grammar makes me so fucking horny!

02:51:27.400 --> 02:51:28.400
Oh no.

02:51:28.400 --> 02:51:32.400
Wow, now I know what clip I'm going to use in the next intro.

02:51:32.400 --> 02:51:33.400
No!

02:51:33.400 --> 02:51:34.400
And now...

02:51:34.400 --> 02:51:35.400
And now...

02:51:35.400 --> 02:51:41.400
And now I just said that monkeys make her horny.

02:51:41.400 --> 02:51:44.400
Call 1-900-DARK-SACRIA!

02:51:44.400 --> 02:51:44.900
Shut up!

02:51:44.900 --> 02:51:48.900
Her turn-ons are good grammar, and guys that-

02:51:48.900 --> 02:51:50.400
And Xanadu!

02:51:50.400 --> 02:51:52.400
Guys that have good hygiene!

02:51:52.400 --> 02:51:56.400
My turn-ons are Electric Light Orchestra and good grammar!

02:51:56.400 --> 02:51:58.400
Her turn-offs are Spielberg-directed-

02:51:58.400 --> 02:52:01.400
I'd get off on Sesame Street, yo!

02:52:01.400 --> 02:52:04.400
Let's get passed out!

02:52:04.400 --> 02:52:08.400
Please stop with the talking about what turn-ons are.

02:52:08.400 --> 02:52:11.640
42 is just like, you know, he doesn't meet those requirements. He does have good hygiene.

02:52:11.640 --> 02:52:16.560
Okay, as soon as he stops using the letter U instead of Y-O-U.

02:52:16.560 --> 02:52:22.320
Okay. Ron Chan has a question. I just want to, like, get this alcohol out

02:52:22.320 --> 02:52:25.600
of my system, like A-S-O-C. You need to be saving your energy for the

02:52:25.600 --> 02:52:28.080
podcast. Right. Okay, whatever.

02:52:28.080 --> 02:52:32.640
Ron Chan has a question. Here's my question. You said on the podcast that Bomberman D.S.

02:52:32.640 --> 02:52:37.720
was $20. Where the hell did you find it for $20? Because I sure as hell couldn't. That

02:52:37.720 --> 02:52:40.940
There was actually Miklotov that ended up buying that for $20. I don't know where he

02:52:40.940 --> 02:52:45.480
bought it, but knowing him, it was probably EB Games or GameStop, one of the two, because

02:52:45.480 --> 02:52:51.160
he used to work for EB Games before he was at Konami. And who else sells? Actually, you

02:52:51.160 --> 02:52:56.160
know what? I saw a good deal on Meteos at Target, of all places. They only wanted $29.99

02:52:56.160 --> 02:53:02.600
as opposed to $39.99 for it, so that was good. So, shop around. Check Frugal as a part of

02:53:02.600 --> 02:53:06.400
Google, if nothing else, and you'll find a good deal there. From what I understand, though,

02:53:06.400 --> 02:53:11.400
I know that you're probably a little late for this, but Circuit City apparently had a really good deal on video games today.

02:53:11.400 --> 02:53:18.400
Like, they were selling $10 video games today, like Amplitude, and what's that GameCube roleplaying game, Byte and Kaitos or whatever?

02:53:18.400 --> 02:53:21.400
Those were all like $10 today. Pretty cool, huh?

02:53:21.400 --> 02:53:23.400
Alright.

02:53:23.400 --> 02:53:30.400
Oh, DeepThought42 wants you to know that his father is an English professor.

02:53:30.400 --> 02:53:32.400
I'm sorry, English. I'm drunk.

02:53:32.400 --> 02:53:35.400
His father is an English professor.

02:53:35.400 --> 02:53:42.900
That's awfully tempting. That's pretty hot. However, I am highly taken. My fiancé is excellent.

02:53:42.900 --> 02:53:47.900
It's just a cuddle. It's just a cuddle. It's not making out. It's not sex.

02:53:47.900 --> 02:53:57.900
Alright, Vidpowel wants to know, is the OLR crew doing anything worth mentioning on the 4th of July?

02:53:57.900 --> 02:54:03.900
We know that Loki has to deal with his family tomorrow.

02:54:03.900 --> 02:54:08.480
Oh my god. I'm sorry, oh my car.

02:54:08.480 --> 02:54:12.720
Cause my car is God. I'm so dizzy right now, it's not even funny.

02:54:12.720 --> 02:54:16.640
Are you gonna barf? Cause if so, you need to go back to the bathroom. I'm not gonna throw up, nah.

02:54:16.640 --> 02:54:19.920
I'm just really dizzy. If I take...

02:54:19.920 --> 02:54:23.240
In fact, if my stomach is fine, I'll be fine.

02:54:23.240 --> 02:54:28.200
You look kinda bloated. Seriously!

02:54:28.200 --> 02:54:33.240
Okay, what is the first thing that alcohol does that makes you brutally honest with everybody?

02:54:33.240 --> 02:54:36.760
So, like, how... what was it Margaret Cho said about grappa?

02:54:36.760 --> 02:54:41.040
You have that skin! Oh, you look bloated.

02:54:41.040 --> 02:54:46.400
So you're eating meat on the 4th of July? Yeah, I'm not going into the vegetarian thing yet.

02:54:46.400 --> 02:54:49.760
I don't know what I'm doing for the 4th of July. I actually have no plans.

02:54:49.760 --> 02:54:54.200
Why don't you come hang out with us? Possibly. We were gonna have people over for movies, but we don't know yet.

02:54:54.200 --> 02:54:57.500
Rob, you need to come hang out with us. You need to meet

02:54:57.500 --> 02:55:00.640
Adam and Tina and all my friends. I can probably do that.

02:55:00.640 --> 02:55:02.640
I call them my downside friends.

02:55:02.640 --> 02:55:04.640
Give me a call tomorrow when we're sober.

02:55:04.640 --> 02:55:06.640
You got it.

02:55:06.640 --> 02:55:10.640
I think that's going to bring another show to a close, boys and girls.

02:55:10.640 --> 02:55:13.640
Thank God, because this show is really starting to go downhill fast.

02:55:13.640 --> 02:55:16.640
So now we're going to go around and get everybody,

02:55:16.640 --> 02:55:18.640
and now we're going to try and tape a podcast.

02:55:18.640 --> 02:55:19.640
That should be tons of fun.

02:55:19.640 --> 02:55:23.640
Now we're going to go around and get everybody's final thought.

02:55:23.640 --> 02:55:25.640
DarkSakura, why don't you start us off,

02:55:25.640 --> 02:55:26.640
because you're the most sober out of everybody.

02:55:26.640 --> 02:55:27.640
What's your final thought?

02:55:27.640 --> 02:55:29.640
Reject false icons.

02:55:57.640 --> 02:56:09.840
the final word of the show, one word to sum it all up, thank you guys for listening by

02:56:09.840 --> 02:56:16.920
the way, and if this was your first show tonight, seriously guys, this isn't what it's normally

02:56:16.920 --> 02:56:17.920
like.

02:56:17.920 --> 02:56:18.920
I'm sorry to see your first show.

02:56:18.920 --> 02:56:22.200
We normally are not drunk and louts on the show.

02:56:22.200 --> 02:56:26.080
I didn't even think that because of the iTunes thing we'd have way more listeners this week,

02:56:26.080 --> 02:56:28.620
meaning we'd have way more people who were listening to the show the first time.

02:56:28.620 --> 02:56:29.620
Whoops!

02:56:29.620 --> 02:56:31.820
That was a bad calculation on when to do a drunk show.

02:56:31.820 --> 02:56:32.820
My bad.

02:56:32.820 --> 02:56:38.040
We did the drunk show because, first of all, it is our three-year anniversary, plus it

02:56:38.040 --> 02:56:39.460
is also a three-day weekend.

02:56:39.460 --> 02:56:41.460
We were taking advantage of it.

02:56:41.460 --> 02:56:44.460
Every three-day weekend that comes up, we usually get pissed.

02:56:44.460 --> 02:56:47.400
So, again, tune in next week.

02:56:47.400 --> 02:56:48.400
Give us one more chance.

02:56:48.400 --> 02:56:50.100
I swear we will be sober.

02:56:50.100 --> 02:56:54.900
Loki will probably be highly embarrassed because his family's been listening to him drunk on

02:56:54.900 --> 02:57:02.960
the show, and we'll be full of our usual, you know, piss and angst next week.

02:57:02.960 --> 02:57:07.500
Really quick last minute questions, actually just one, from Dirty Thief, see another new

02:57:07.500 --> 02:57:09.000
name, I don't recognize his name.

02:57:09.000 --> 02:57:13.440
Can Loki share with us his family reactions on the next show?

02:57:13.440 --> 02:57:16.120
Nellie says she'll do it if nothing else.

02:57:16.120 --> 02:57:17.680
Loki's reaching for the microphone.

02:57:17.680 --> 02:57:22.920
Well, my reactions probably to my family is going to be, they'll be like surprised that

02:57:22.920 --> 02:57:26.760
them drunk in the show but they'll probably understand this is a three-day

02:57:26.760 --> 02:57:31.120
weekend it's just a radio stuff other than that you know those just like I

02:57:31.120 --> 02:57:36.880
can't believe we heard you drunk yeah he's gonna sleep well I'm just really

02:57:36.880 --> 02:57:42.800
tired right now and I don't feel so good so I'm just gonna try to like you know

02:57:42.800 --> 02:57:47.160
deal with this alcohol as best I can without making the mess of the apartment

02:57:47.160 --> 02:57:59.160
Alright, final word of the show, one word to sum it all up, Loki, pick that microphone back up and give us one word that sums it all up. See you next week everybody.

02:57:59.160 --> 02:58:04.160
Don't drink and drive is really bad. One word! One word!

02:58:04.160 --> 02:58:12.560
That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.

02:58:12.560 --> 02:58:16.920

And now, here is your fortune cookie message of the day.

02:58:34.000 --> 02:58:39.000
auto-destruct sequence in 5, 4, 3, 2...

02:58:45.000 --> 02:58:50.000
Whoops! That's not the right track. Hold on. I'm drunk. What can I say? Hold on.

02:58:50.000 --> 02:58:54.000
Here it is. We'll do this track instead. Try this one.

02:58:58.000 --> 02:59:00.000
Captain caught me on the holodeck

02:59:00.000 --> 02:59:05.000
With a blaster in my hand

02:59:05.000 --> 02:59:13.000
He looked so mad, I thought I was out of the band

02:59:13.000 --> 02:59:15.000
I was trying to think of something to say

02:59:15.000 --> 02:59:17.000
But my R2 unit gave me away

02:59:17.000 --> 02:59:19.000
And the captain looked at me and said

02:59:19.000 --> 02:59:21.000
Where's Star Trek band?

02:59:21.000 --> 02:59:26.000
Put the fucking blaster away

02:59:26.000 --> 02:59:28.000
Hurrah!

02:59:30.000 --> 02:59:33.000
Captain caught me on the holodeck

02:59:33.000 --> 02:59:36.000
With a lightsaber in my hand

02:59:38.000 --> 02:59:40.000
And I knew right then

02:59:40.000 --> 02:59:43.000
I was in for a redshirt reprimand

02:59:46.000 --> 02:59:48.000
I was trying to think of something to say

02:59:48.000 --> 02:59:50.000
But my Vader helmet gave me away

02:59:50.000 --> 02:59:52.000
And the captain looked at me and said

02:59:52.000 --> 02:59:57.000
Can't use the force, put the fucking lightsaber away

03:00:03.000 --> 03:00:05.000
Captain caught me on the holodeck

03:00:06.000 --> 03:00:08.000
With my Java in my hand

03:00:11.000 --> 03:00:13.000
A fist full of Vaseline

03:00:14.000 --> 03:00:16.000
All covered in sand

03:00:18.000 --> 03:00:20.000
I was trying to think of something to say

03:00:20.000 --> 03:00:24.700
Something to say, but my naked lair gave me away, and the captain looked at me and said,

03:00:24.700 --> 03:00:29.700
Get the fuck off the holodeck, I'm about to get laid.

03:00:33.200 --> 03:00:34.200
Harranth!

03:00:35.200 --> 03:00:36.200
Harranth!

03:00:37.200 --> 03:00:38.200
Harranth!

03:00:39.200 --> 03:00:40.200
Harranth!

03:00:41.200 --> 03:00:42.200
Harranth!

03:00:43.200 --> 03:00:44.200
Harranth!

03:00:45.200 --> 03:00:46.200
Harranth!

03:00:46.200 --> 03:00:55.480
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.

03:01:16.200 --> 03:01:38.520
Well, kids, what can we say?

03:01:38.520 --> 03:01:40.520
That wraps up another life edition of-

03:01:40.520 --> 03:01:44.800
Don't y'all choose to die in!

03:01:44.800 --> 03:01:49.720
I don't know what else to say. I'm speechless. Tonight was the most interesting episode of
