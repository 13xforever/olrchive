169	3112	Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of July 4th, 2005.
3232	13884	You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.
14144	17568	Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
19406	29954	Hello, everybody, and welcome to another edition of our podcast, Your Home, dedicated to video games and video gaming, most notably the games that don't suck.
30495	31395	My name is Rob Roberts.
31415	32436	You might know me as Sky.
32496	36819	Joining me as always, my awesome co-host, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
36859	37360	There she is.
37620	38361	Cheerio, loves.
38941	39762	How are you doing, hon?
42404	42904	Recovering.
43064	45626	Yeah, we'll talk about what's been going on here in a little bit.
46067	49129	And in the other corner, the one and only TechMazzaLoki.
50384	51746	Hey, how you doing?
51826	52508	Holding up okay?
54281	57222	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
83830	86686	We did a little bit of drinking.
86706	87450	A little bit.
88502	90782	So we're recovering from that right now.
90882	97184	Loki more so than anybody because he had a little experience with my toilet, needless to say.
97264	98144	Let's just leave it at that.
98164	101085	He was bowed down before the porcelain goddess.
101225	101925	Exactly.
102345	103625	DarkSakura and I, we're fine.
104085	105745	Remember, kids, don't drink and drive.
105846	107686	We're doing this because we have designated drivers.
107706	108566	Don't drink and date.
109026	109646	It's good rating.
109686	110867	Yes, don't drink and date.
110927	111767	That's the especially important thing.
111787	113367	That might get you in a bit more trouble.
113407	116108	However, drinking and DDR is okay.
116128	117428	It's funny as hell.
118328	119308	I've played DDR Drunk.
119469	121189	I did Vegas once, I remember.
121649	123290	Of all places, I was playing DDR Drunk.
123330	125491	I just remember feeling very heavy.
125671	126892	My choker's choking me.
127372	127632	Alright.
128272	131333	Anyway, let's talk about our gaming weeks.
131394	135015	Before we get into the gaming news here on Orange Launch Radio, we always talk about our gaming weeks.
135115	137136	Starting off with the one and only DarkSakura.
137156	139877	I know you got your move done, so you got a chance to play any games this week?
139957	140737	We did move.
141138	146320	I haven't played any games except the Potato Peeler on Gorillas.com and, of course, Widescreen Pong.
147400	151682	Um, so, uh, we did, however, purchase a 50-inch HD widescreen TV.
151762	154164	I was gonna say, you have a sweet new gamer rig, if nothing else.
154284	159146	As soon as we pick up some, uh, component cables, I'm gonna be freaking trying out 2DX on that.
159666	161987	Is that the first game you're gonna try on there, is Beatmania 2DX?
162008	163468	Hell yeah.
163788	164509	Alright.
165248	166048	Sounds good to me.
167729	169390	You've got a sweet gaming rig, it sounds like.
169430	172932	You have a better gaming rig than anybody else I know, so we're definitely going to have to go over there.
173172	177974	We'll have to do a podcast over there at some point on your sweet new 50-inch TV.
177994	186217	I actually added the laptop to it, and we tried to watch Tokyo Breakfast, and it wouldn't load, so we watched The Deadly Negro.
187578	188078	Amazing.
188458	188899	What is that?
188939	189459	I don't even know it.
189801	195762	It's this guy who basically screams and yells motherfucker a lot to Afronova.
196603	198043	But the second one is funny.
198143	199924	Where can you get that from?
199984	202444	Totallycracked.com Sounds appropriate.
203424	207785	Loki, you look a little dazed and confused right now, but can you tell us about your gaming week?
208726	209386	Make it coherent.
210851	214936	Miami Week is mainly Destroy All Humans.
214996	216999	That's pretty much all we've been playing this week.
217720	220523	I actually did finish the game itself.
221365	226231	It is pretty simplistic other than, you know,
227045	230768	Destroying All Humans, but it's a lot of fun.
230828	235991	They have the voice actor that does Invader Zim in it, so you gotta love that.
236332	240475	And other than that, it's a lot of fun, so definitely check it out.
240915	243997	Didn't you say you got to take a sneak peek at some new PSP game?
244437	245899	Yeah, I have a PSP.
246559	252543	I'm borrowing the PSP version of... What was it?
252643	252944	It was...
256465	257786	I know you're drunk, but think.
257886	258387	Think hard.
259367	260008	Think hard.
260208	268334	No, honestly, it's... I don't remember.
268434	270596	It's basically... It's a lot of fun.
270616	273297	You don't even remember what the name of the game is.
279702	280903	No, but honestly, it's...
284594	285595	I don't even remember.
286176	286857	Alright, forget it.
287398	289681	There's some new PSP game that's coming out.
289741	290522	I can't believe that.
290542	291283	Dead to Rights.
291303	292424	There you go.
292464	293045	Dead to Rights.
293085	294327	Yeah, Dead to Rights.
295929	296830	I've been playing that.
297230	300514	It's basically like Dead to Rights 2, but it's for the PSP.
300575	301516	You've got the dog.
301616	302377	It's a lot of fun.
303295	314721	um definitely check it out if you've got PSP because honestly there's not that much out right now it's for the PSP so PSP is suffering from what DS was suffering from like yeah exactly PSP syndrome basically
315433	316633	DS Syndrome Bullet Time Effect
338243	342224	Yeah, I mean, since the Matrix, um... Is it still cool?
342284	343044	That's what I want to know.
343364	344805	Oh, hell yeah, it's still cool.
344885	345905	You know, just check it out.
346045	347886	It's a lot of fun, honestly.
348186	359129	Um, but if you really want to, you know, save some money and stuff, just download the Genesis emulators and whatnot and, um, play those because they don't cost anything and it's a lot of fun.
360149	366851	And, um, definitely if you're out there buying PSP games, don't do it while you're drunk because, um...
367916	371617	Obviously, you're going to be spending money on stuff that you shouldn't be spending money on.
372497	373538	Take it from me, okay?
373578	376598	Because I'm, you know... Because you drink and go shopping all the time.
376718	378619	I drink and go shopping, yeah, exactly.
379059	381300	And then, you know, you become sober and you're like, what the hell?
381360	382240	Why did I buy this?
382380	390422	So, honestly, folks, if you're drunk, just, you know, seriously, just, you know, make your peace with the porcelain god and...
391421	392121	Take it from there.
392621	394802	You're being a lethargic drunk tonight, I think.
395082	396062	It's very interesting.
398382	404543	I've already thrown up about four times over the porcelain god, as you would put it.
404923	407184	Kneel down before the porcelain goddess.
407824	416745	I've never actually thrown up while I've been drunk, so I've hit a whole new level of drunkenness.
416785	417686	Take it from me, though.
418006	419766	The PSP game version of...
420766	428139	Dead of the Rights is pretty cool, so I definitely recommend checking it out, but honestly, try it before you buy it.
428640	431225	Don't go out and buy these PSP games, because
431769	432450	Thanks for watching!
451673	459535	This is what the DS is all about, you guys, because the touchscreen adds so much to this game, because it allows the game to be fast-paced.
459875	462775	Because you move your blocks literally with the stylus.
463656	467917	You can play this game with the controller and the button, but it would not work.
467977	471177	Having to swap the bricks one at a time, it just would not work the same.
471477	476779	But having a stylus where you can drag your blocks up and down... Because the interesting thing about Meteos, you can't move them left and right.
476819	478739	You only move your blocks up and down, which is kind of weird.
479360	482108	It adds this whole new dimension to a puzzle game.
482148	484094	I can't explain it, but it makes it very fast-paced.
484475	485558	Meteos is very cool.
485618	486440	I love it because...
487213	496700	Being kind of a short attention gamer, or a gamer ADD, as I sometimes call it, where sometimes I only want to play a game for 5-10 minutes, Meteos works out really well for me.
497981	500043	A lot of people have been comparing this game to Luminous.
500123	502064	Well, of course, it's the same company, same developer.
502505	509430	I would say the music and graphics aren't quite what they are in Luminous, but I think that's just a system holdback.
509470	515915	I mean, obviously on the PSP, which is more CD-based, you're going to get better music, and you get stuff like the Mondo Grosso track, Shinin', whatever.
516455	518476	It works out better for that.
518576	523678	But that's not to knock Meteos because it's an incredible concept for a game.
523998	527539	And the type of game it is, you could not do on the PSP because of the touchscreen and everything.
528219	535542	Definitely, if you're a DS owner, if you like puzzle games to any extent, if you went out and bought Puyo Puyo Fever or you bought any other puzzler, Polarium.
535842	538543	Man, if you wasted the money on Polarium, trust me, you're going to love Meteos.
538663	541424	It redeems DS puzzlers by quite a bit.
541524	542464	So I highly recommend it.
542584	543504	That's been the game I've been playing.
543524	545005	I'm still waiting for lecture, Plankton.
545828	548069	I'm looking forward to Electroplank and, of course, Nintendogs.
548730	549170	So we'll see.
549370	550331	I got my puppies ordered.
551792	552492	Are you getting the U.S.
552552	553252	or Japanese one?
554333	554833	The U.S.
555113	557655	I know a lot of folks... Because I can get it at a 30% off discount.
558425	561267	Alright, let's get into some gaming news.
561327	577137	First off though, I just want to welcome those of you guys that are subscribed to us through iTunes now, because iTunes 4.9 rolled out earlier, actually last week, as you probably know that, and a lot of folks finding Orange Lounge Radio thanks to that, doing a search for video games and finding us.
577497	579478	So a big hello to you guys, hope you enjoy the show.
580119	583021	Just remember, we're a little out of it tonight, so this...
583661	592743	This isn't quite representative of our normal perky selves, but darn it, we are giving you a podcast every week.
592903	595564	Come hell or high water, and I think this just proves it.
595604	597825	Or lots of booze.
598045	601625	I still can't believe I out-drunk Loki, and I'm more sober.
603426	606367	I was going to ask you if anything's going on in the hack and crack scene.
606387	607647	In a couple sentences, anything?
612506	618072	Just the 1.5 version PSP stuff, but that was released last week.
618693	627002	Other than that, really the only thing to mention is the loader for the Luminous is available for the PSP.
628732	633414	So that means there's going to be more PSP games that they're actually running the ROMs for.
633654	637056	But that's kind of a gray area because that's piracy flat out, really.
637096	642238	Yeah, that is piracy, but that's pretty much the big thing that's going on in the PSP world.
642398	650141	But if I'm not mistaken, wouldn't these versions of Luminous or whatever that you load on your memory stick, wouldn't they have stripped graphics?
650201	651202	Typically like a lot of...
652422	652782	What was it?
652822	653482	Dreamcast.
653502	656763	When they were trying to put those on CDs, they would sometimes have to strip out some of the audio.
657284	661105	Luminous, if you strip out the audio and some of the graphics, it's not going to be the same game.
662065	664566	The audio is essential to a game like Luminous.
664606	669807	I don't know what they're doing so far, but so far the thing that's being stripped out is all the audio.
670408	671228	It's not worth it.
671248	676029	It's really not worth it, but it is a step in the right direction, I guess, as far as pirating goes.
682071	684133	But really, who cares about pirating games?
684153	685594	I mean, because most of the games suck.
686215	692661	But all you have to know is that I'm incredibly drunk right now, and that's really what counts.
692681	695543	Somebody strip the caffeine out of Loki or something.
695663	699367	Honestly, folks, if I could feel better right now, that would be great.
699867	702890	Anything you could do to make me feel better, that would be great.
702910	704171	I'll pass off the penguin mints.
704491	704771	All right.
707023	717451	Well, since we got some increased exposure, we've actually been getting some letters on our mailbox, togo, T-O-G-O, at orangeloungeradio.com, and we thought we'd take a minute to read some letters.
721034	723636	Yeah, let's open up the old Orange Lounge Radio letter bag.
725049	742057	Let's see, first email that we have comes from Sakurina, wrote us an email saying that Sakurina was actually listening to one of our older podcasts, the May 9th, 2005 podcast, and had some comments about the banning of violent video games to minors.
742757	748500	Sakurina says, I am a minor, and my parents follow and keep up with the ESRB rating system.
749020	753223	I've always kept up with the ESRB's rating system, and I've followed it as much as possible.
753624	760769	In fact, I've never really played a mature game until Halo in 2001 when I was 10, and I didn't find myself mature enough to play them.
761129	767894	And I gave up on them until last year when I purchased Metal Gear Solid The Twin Snakes, my first mature game I ever purchased.
768374	773502	My parents actually ask me what I'm going to play, and they know how mature I am for each kind of game.
773862	776426	In other words, not all parents are retards.
776967	782274	Good for your parents, but my comments were strictly in reference to the majority.
783716	785957	Again, not all parents are retards.
785997	787457	We want to just reinforce that there.
787957	790998	There's some very intelligent parents out there, and yours sound like that.
791018	794900	And you sound like an intelligent individual as well, because you know what's good for you and what's not.
795300	801121	And we applaud those gamers that know how to distinguish the gaming world from real life.
801222	802942	And like people in Korea, apparently.
803562	805303	Yeah, that's that story we had last week.
805803	808544	All right, let's go on to the second letter we got.
808664	811885	Second letter we got was from Warrior Bob.
812685	820767	Warrior Bob was responding to something last week's show having to do with the ethicalness of emulated games.
820847	821387	Ethicality.
821447	822087	Ethicality.
823047	825108	Sorry, I need to go back to grammar school.
826508	830329	Warrior Bob says, I think I'm somewhere between all your fine selves.
830529	838851	I think it's perfectly okay to emulate something which is no longer easily available on the market out of print games like the pre-32-bit catalog.
839249	841711	Japanese games never released here, etc.
842812	845894	In the case of the re-released Nintendo games, the situation has changed.
846254	851318	Now these games like Zelda and Metroid are easily available on the market, but the price is somewhat questionable.
851698	856702	I think the emulation is valid with these titles, so long as an original NES copy is owned.
857182	860546	The fact that the titles are selling shows that there exists a market.
860846	865771	And as Jamie pointed out, many people consider it worth the price to have a portable version of the game.
866172	869956	I know I myself bought a copy of the GBA Zelda re-release.
871398	879066	So, of course, you know, there's something to be said about the added value of the convenience of having it in your GBA with all this complicated emulated stuff.
879326	879707	DarkSakura.com
894725	896226	Alright, well thank you guys for your letters.
896287	902352	Again, if you guys have any emails out there, you can always send us an email to go at orangeloungeradio.com.
902392	904093	Alright, let's get into some gaming news tonight.
904434	909358	We'll start it off actually talking about the GBA and the DS.
909738	919407	This is interesting because the website Nintendojo is saying that 57,000 Nintendo DSs were sold in May to American consumers.
919887	921568	Well, how many sold versus how many shipped?
935877	936557	That's true, too.
936637	936958	I don't know.
937018	938118	So it doesn't really account for all that.
938458	939739	However, this is what's interesting.
940079	943700	The GBA sold 237,000 units.
944961	948202	So it's outselling the DS, which is interesting.
948222	952424	Do you think that's just because it's cheaper or people just aren't into the DS thing?
952464	953264	What do you think's up with that?
953964	956065	I think it has to do with both of those reasons, actually.
957225	960727	And also keep in mind the way marketing works for them, at least in Japan.
961345	961645	Most of them.
986481	986861	I don't know.
987241	990024	I'm using my DS as my GBA as well.
990584	1001793	Our buddies over in Europe, there's a story being announced there that the DS in Europe has sold 1 million units and that's since the portable launch there three months ago.
1002153	1005076	Worldwide DS sales now at 6 million.
1005116	1006797	So it's taken off in Europe.
1007742	1014686	But you know the PSP, they're cracking down on the importing of the PSPs before it's actually released out there and all this interesting stuff.
1014726	1016927	Which should actually be coming up in the next Mother Show.
1017268	1017988	Yeah, very soon.
1018068	1019709	So you guys don't have to wait much longer for that.
1021497	1025799	There was actually a lot of news this week about MTV, which I think is very interesting.
1028300	1032502	MTV has formed their own MTV Games unit.
1033122	1042846	MTV Games is devoted to, quote, "...developing, producing, and promoting unique and creative gaming experiences that resonate with MTV's audience."
1043246	1051793	And this kind of falls in line with another article that's been floating around in the music game community saying that MTV is talking, they want to get into the music games.
1052654	1057317	But I can't help but think, haven't MTV put out games already to some extent?
1057357	1058558	Like I remember there was a remote control.
1058578	1059479	The music generator games.
1059679	1063042	The music generator games, the remote control games on Nintendo.
1063914	1070737	But I'm thinking, okay, the difference is that those were games put out by other companies using the MTV license.
1071357	1073898	Now MTV wants to do their own thing.
1074578	1075819	So what do you think?
1076059	1079140	Is it going to be commercially successful?
1079160	1082622	I mean, let's face it, MTV, huge marketing machine, they get free advertising.
1082902	1083282	Crap.
1085036	1112088	are you saying that just because you're getting older and jaded with MTV or do you truly believe there's something else here there's gonna be stupid children that's gonna buy it though MTV does not know how to market games honestly I mean they hello look at it's MTV a channel itself it's supposed to be music music on their channel it's all just stupid reality TV shows I mean hello road rules the game honestly folks um
1113228	1119235	They might be able to market it as a game, but I think it's gonna fail overall.
1119736	1120937	That's the way I think it is.
1131488	1135751	They're going to jointly... Basically what's going to happen, it's like a partnership for marketing.
1136011	1141255	They're going to jointly sell in-game advertising and collaborating on the soundtracks and things like that.
1141615	1143757	Now get this, Midway has LA Rush, right?
1144097	1151442	What they're going to do is they're going to take some branding from Pimp My Ride on MTV and incorporate that into LA Rush.
1151662	1152363	Good for them.
1152443	1156446	I mean, as long as they get their game out there, I mean, whatever way they...
1156906	1157847	Managers do that.
1157967	1158947	That's good for them.
1159047	1162529	Works out for Midway because they get free marketing, basically.
1162549	1163330	Honestly.
1163630	1166431	Does that disgrace the L.A.
1166892	1168092	Rush franchise?
1168192	1169653	No, honestly, L.A.
1169713	1172095	Rush wasn't that good of a game to begin with.
1172915	1177658	I'd rather see them pushing the Pimp My Ride aspect of that.
1178298	1181480	It's just, it's really sad that that game really sucked.
1181620	1185022	I mean, the problem is, is that... I don't mind L.A.
1185042	1185762	Rush, it's alright.
1185942	1186603	It was okay!
1186623	1188744	I enjoyed, like, Hydro Thunder and Arctic Thunder.
1188824	1189684	It was okay!
1189785	1193206	The problem was, it lost all the aspects of the Rush series.
1193567	1206254	I mean, the Rush series is basically like, okay, you have, like, you know, a set track that you go to, there's a few shortcuts and whatnot, and there's some really cool, you know, shortcuts you can take that, you know, involve, like, a lot of big jumps and whatnot.
1206274	1206354	Yeah.
1207791	1209493	DarkSakura, any thoughts on this?
1226816	1228418	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1245879	1274794	either that or we would let our 4 year old babies die so in order to help better your life we're here to offer you some advice to help better your life in many ways and who better to bring that advice to you than DarkSakura with her advice column today's bit of advice is how to survive a fall onto subway tracks number one do not attempt to climb back onto the platform unless you are positive you have enough time to do so
1276031	1279714	2.
1276652	1279714	Find a safe place to stand out of the way of the oncoming train.
1282235	1279714	3.
1282315	1288079	Stand against a wall between columns separating two tracks on an adjoining set of tracks or beneath the platform.
1289251	1295596	4.
1289672	1295596	Remove any articles of clothing or bags that could catch on the train and stand still, straight, and tall.
1295656	1296177	Wait, I don't get that.
1296197	1297838	You're not supposed to jump on the platform?
1297858	1298198	What do you do?
1298218	1301321	You jump on the other tracks where the train isn't coming and hope you're right?
1301621	1306905	There's a middle section that has the pillars that hold the area up between where the alternating tracks are.
1307125	1308686	Not every subway system.
1308746	1310987	Not every, but there are many that do.
1311007	1312267	Because I'm thinking about Bart.
1312407	1317310	Bart doesn't have, okay, the picture you have shows, okay, I understand that, but like Bart doesn't have that.
1317390	1320731	So if I fall on the tracks on Bart, I'm dead, basically, is what you're saying.
1320751	1320911	Yeah.
1321252	1321492	Okay.
1321712	1322952	Unless you can get your ass up.
1323152	1323613	All right, I'm sorry.
1323633	1325253	But my final piece of advice.
1325273	1325514	Yes.
1326514	1328375	Don't fucking ride the subway to hit a taxi.
1334438	1337400	Our New York friends can benefit from this piece of advice.
1337420	1338061	How about this?
1338781	1341604	Don't cross the yellow line, kids.
1342004	1344987	Each knee, each knee, Suicide Club, yo.
1346008	1347750	If you got that reference, hats off to you.
1350472	1351633	Big news this week.
1351673	1352053	It doesn't...
1379795	1382017	I'm sure a lot of you guys have heard a lot about this story.
1382418	1383659	I'm curious what you guys think.
1383859	1387003	DarkSakura, what do you think about this, this peer-to-peer ruling?
1387243	1390827	Do you think this is fair, that Grokester should be held responsible for what its users do with it?
1393385	1422920	ultimately they are providing the means so legally the service that provides the means for the illegal activity has a right of responsibility they would basically be found negligent for allowing the misuse of their material however there is not a way to regulate this which again in the eyes of the court would be you shouldn't offer this service don't operate your business
1424110	1427292	But again, that takes money out of their pocket.
1428012	1433555	Which, taking money out of the pocket of a small business eventually will hurt the economy.
1434315	1438377	Therefore, they're basically treading on some thin ice right here, the courts and the company.
1439138	1449003	So the court's probably looking at this as a way to hold them responsible as a party while maintaining balance in industry.
1450263	1451584	I mean, if that makes sense to you.
1452566	1453727	Okay, okay, I'll follow you.
1453987	1457150	Again, I'm coming from having taken that business law class.
1457650	1458171	All right, all right.
1458952	1460093	All right, moving on.
1460533	1461974	My thoughts on this whole thing.
1462094	1466058	I think it really depends on how you're marketing your peer-to-peer network.
1466598	1469401	I think if you're marketing your peer-to-peer network as...
1470542	1474525	Hey, come to our network and trade your illegal MP3 files on our network.
1474826	1477428	Then yes, I think you can be held responsible.
1477808	1493523	But I think if you're marketing your network as something that should be used for legit purposes, the trading of open source programs or what have you, and this is what you're encouraging your users to do and you're discouraging your users via marketing,
1493823	1497644	Actually, I have a case that I can repeat, and I'll go home my case.
1497684	1498204	The weed eater.
1521931	1534477	has a warning on it that says, do not allow people under the age of, I believe that it was 15 years old, within 20 feet of this machine while being operated.
1536298	1538619	In this case, an uncle was weed eating the lawn.
1539580	1541921	The thing was fully on the machine.
1542961	1544822	10 year old kids picking up dirt after it.
1545602	1548663	The uncle, the mom's like off doing something else.
1548703	1550684	She's there but not observing her child.
1551705	1553545	The guy hits a rock with the weed eater.
1554145	1555626	And this is the one with the metal blades.
1556606	1557387	It recoils.
1558227	1560748	Goes backwards and slices off the child's arm at the elbow.
1562349	1566370	Now, we are looking at this as logical adults.
1567751	1568771	Who do you think would be at fault?
1571240	1576003	As a logical adult, would it be the uncle for his negligence?
1576583	1577684	Or would it be the weed eater company?
1578624	1582006	I think it would be the child because they're dumb enough to walk next to him.
1582026	1582947	Again, using common sense.
1583007	1586589	It falls in one of those categories of accidents happen.
1586609	1588590	It's like a car, accidents happen.
1588870	1590711	It's unfortunate, but it was an accident.
1590771	1592172	I don't think anybody's liable in that case.
1592712	1593873	That's my opinion is logical.
1594221	1598824	In the state of Oklahoma, there are three cases for a company to be held liable for negligence.
1599525	1605289	That's for default of the machine, accident caused by said default, to misuse of the item.
1605970	1611293	The company was actually found at fault for a default that the machine did not have.
1611874	1618619	Now, taking that example, that poison notice on the bottle of bleach isn't going to mean shit.
1620300	1625342	unless it is proven that the child swallowed the item while the parent was negligent.
1625722	1627023	And then it is the parent's fault.
1627403	1633925	However, again... Well, okay, tying this back to the peer-to-peer network thing before we lose too many people in our analogies.
1633965	1636326	Well, yeah, but I'm using it as... No, I understand, I understand.
1636746	1638027	But no...
1638857	1647665	The MPAA or the RIAA is not going to... Well, I guess they have been suing the individual users to some extent, but having very limited success in doing so.
1647745	1650447	And it's bad, bad PR for them, too.
1651168	1653149	Oh, yeah.
1653229	1655311	Now, the way that this ties into the peer-to-peer.
1656532	1657773	Peer-to-peer office of service.
1658474	1663258	They do have the disclaimers on there that this is not to be used for X purposes, right?
1663278	1663358	Yeah.
1664154	1668546	some of them it depends on the network even those that have that notice on there
1669469	1675813	If their product is being, quote, misused, they're still responsible.
1676193	1676653	That's interesting.
1676693	1679555	In the eyes of the court, they should still be responsible.
1679635	1683257	Now, again, logically, that doesn't make sense.
1683657	1690061	Logically, it should be in the hands of the person who is misusing the product as long as the disclaimer exists.
1690541	1696905	Now, another thing, too, is that when they download that service, there's usually, and I've studied this, there is a click agreement.
1697512	1700580	by clicking that little box that says you agree to their terms of service
1701582	1706363	You are signing a contract that says, I will not misuse this item.
1706783	1709944	I will not do this for anything other than a specific purpose intended.
1710284	1713485	So even after all that, the companies could still be held liable?
1713885	1730089	I don't, if they are in the case that they have that as a full part of their agreement, and the parties violating that terms of service have clicked that agreement, they're using their product, and that clause exists,
1730729	1732369	I do not believe the company should be held liable.
1732630	1733390	They put it in there.
1733870	1737071	It is the point of the user at that point.
1737671	1742892	Violating terms of service which removes negligence from the company.
1743012	1743732	Here's the reality.
1743772	1744673	How many people read that?
1745133	1745973	No one does.
1746893	1749654	Well, maybe 5% of the users of it.
1750254	1753715	Still, how many people buy a house and don't read their mortgage?
1753875	1754075	True.
1755471	1756672	I work at a mortgage company.
1757032	1759815	How many freaking calls did I get when I was in customer service?
1760335	1762917	Why do I have a prepayment penalty?
1763137	1764878	Well, didn't you read your contract?
1764918	1767680	You had three days to change your fucking mind.
1768841	1770903	Again, pardon me for my rudeness on that.
1771523	1774645	But people need to freaking read.
1775506	1777447	You sign a contract, you need to read it.
1777528	1780370	And I think that in the case of this peer-to-peer networks...
1781221	1783604	I think that they shouldn't be held at fault at all.
1783664	1787428	However, those who are too stupid to put that clause in there, oh yeah, nail them.
1788108	1788569	Seriously.
1788829	1791452	Alright, many different perspectives on this issue.
1791472	1792753	A very hot button issue in the community.
1792793	1794555	If you have thoughts, we'd love to hear them.
1794675	1796837	And I'm sorry for going off on the legal aspect of it.
1796877	1799400	That's something that really I research.
1799460	1802343	We want people to think about the different perspectives of looking at it.
1802703	1806125	A lot of people are just stomping their foot going, that's not fair.
1806205	1808306	I want to keep downloading music for free.
1808366	1809286	It's not fair.
1809947	1816790	In the case of this, you have to really look at the big picture to understand what's going on.
1816850	1819131	The average gamer, I don't think is going to do that.
1819371	1822233	The average gamer is probably going to be teenage, lower 20s.
1822573	1824274	The average gamer.
1828102	1829504	To hugely generalize, yes.
1829844	1834448	But they're not going to be in the age group that is known for thinking about this type of thing.
1835309	1846279	You know, but if you're going to have an opinion, it's a good idea to have an informed opinion as opposed to stomping your foot and acting like an ignorant little child.
1847560	1848481	Sorry is the truth.
1849402	1851964	And we're here to help educate you and think about this.
1851984	1853005	Exactly, exactly.
1853045	1853286	All right.
1854028	1854608	Let's move on.
1854649	1855849	We lost Loki.
1856010	1856810	No, that's all right.
1857030	1858271	Did Loki pass out finally?
1858291	1858692	No.
1858712	1859512	He's still with us, Loki?
1859913	1860173	All right.
1860553	1861694	He's still there a little bit.
1862294	1862555	All right.
1862775	1864456	Loki, do you have a thought on the peer-to-peer thing?
1864536	1865917	Can you get your microphone back up there?
1866157	1867278	We dropped it earlier.
1867298	1868759	The opinion of the average drunk.
1869120	1870241	What are we talking about now?
1870881	1871542	Exactly.
1872422	1875845	Peer-to-peer networks said you can be held liable.
1876145	1879688	The Supreme Court says you, grokester, can be held liable because people misuse your service.
1879708	1880709	I've never heard of grokester.
1881189	1889936	My thought is, you know what, honestly, those peer-to-peer networks, they know that there's legal files being shared on there.
1890756	1897061	They're just doing the best they can to, you know, cover their asses, so... Honestly, um...
1898442	1902486	You don't need to go through Grokester to find all the files that you're looking for.
1902506	1904889	The hell with Grokester.
1904909	1906610	You are bringing up this point that a lot of people say.
1906690	1909473	When you squelch one problem, it just gets bigger.
1909493	1911936	For instance, if they had never shut down Napster...
1912888	1914709	iTunes probably would be a lot more successful.
1914729	1920972	Even though iTunes is having a lot of success now, iTunes would probably be more successful if it had showed up before they shut down Napster.
1921012	1923533	Because people would have went from Napster to iTunes.
1923593	1926955	Instead, people went from Napster to... Well, actually, and I take that back.
1927375	1930336	iTunes did exist in some form on the Mac only, though.
1930636	1934218	But Mac only has a smaller share than the PC.
1934418	1937200	I went from Napster to... What was that?
1937300	1937700	Music...
1939091	1961529	Audio Galaxy Some people went to LimeWire, Nutella, there was a lot From that I went to Kazaa and now I'm on BitTorrent And the problem is getting worse and worse And I, by the way, am downloading files illegally And if you come try to search through my computer, oh government I'm going to fucking nail your ass to the goddamn wall and get you to fucking pay me
1962290	1970258	for violation of privacy and violating my rights under the Constitution.
1970618	1973060	Oh yeah, I'm going to nail you if you pull that shit on me.
1973120	1975002	You do know anyone can listen to this podcast, right?
1975262	1975723	Oh, I don't care.
1975923	1977424	They do it.
1977905	1981368	We are on unregulated freaking radio.
1981708	1982389	I will nail you.
1983750	1984071	Wow.
1984691	1985712	Them's fighting words.
1986253	1986693	I don't care.
1989915	1991756	The BBC is running a story.
1991796	1994417	This story actually being linked from Slash.
1994457	1995157	Well, this is interesting.
1995717	2001179	BBC is running a story saying that women are going to explode onto the gaming scene any minute now.
2005460	2007221	I just exploded on the gaming scene.
2008536	2010397	By the way, I'm not really downloading illegal files.
2010557	2013978	You can pretty much figure where the rest of this story is going.
2014038	2020101	Saying that online role-playing games are doing good with women, despite the subject matter, da-da-da.
2021541	2024963	Women gamers in the UK make up a quarter of the gaming population.
2024983	2026583	39% in the US, 69% in South Korea.
2030771	2036193	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2051704	2054166	I enjoy my Phantasy Star Online.
2055066	2056247	I've been a week without it.
2057828	2059029	But it doesn't matter.
2060210	2064653	Why is there a stupid report about this freaking bullcrap?
2065354	2068796	Because a lot of horny guys out there want to be gay or women.
2068836	2071278	Because you're like, oh my god, girls play video games!
2071458	2073920	What is the freaking 21st century?
2074300	2075501	Get with the times!
2075561	2076722	It doesn't need a study!
2077042	2078383	There were girls that played Atari.
2079164	2079484	Hello.
2080024	2081484	I played Atari, hello.
2081504	2084845	But admittedly, not as many women play games as guys.
2085145	2088426	Well, that needs to freaking change, but you don't need a report to tell you this.
2089586	2090486	So what do they need to do?
2090546	2091346	Really quickly, what do they need to do?
2091366	2094947	They need to turn off their Xbox and go out and meet people.
2095687	2096447	No, no, I'm not talking about that.
2096467	2096787	Get laid.
2096827	2098028	How do you get more women in games?
2100108	2101428	Is it the type of games they're putting out?
2101468	2102609	Is it the way they market them?
2103009	2104749	Is it just society stigma?
2105538	2108619	I think the average woman interest is ridiculous.
2109119	2110479	They need like Cosmo the game.
2111860	2113540	So Paris Hilton needs to put out a video game.
2113980	2114500	I guess.
2114620	2116241	You know, how to be a social whore.
2117181	2120181	But the rest, no gamer would ever take a game like that seriously.
2120221	2125083	Just like Mary Kay and Ashley learn to drive or whatever, Sweet 16 are the laughing stock of the gaming world.
2125383	2125603	Yeah.
2126303	2130784	Well, the thing is, is that I play freaking Ragnarok and Ragnarok's cutesy.
2131697	2136458	I played Final Fantasy XI, I played Phantasy Star Online.
2137158	2140919	I played Halo until I found out it made me motion sick.
2140959	2149361	My favorite game of all time is freaking Guardian Legend, which is one of the single hardest video games ever.
2149962	2155463	I played Abadox, which was supposed to be the most gory video game when it came out.
2155503	2156423	You're just special, though.
2156603	2157523	That's what it boils down to.
2157804	2159504	I am a true gamer woman.
2161216	2165267	I feel sorry though for other women to have me as the voice of the gaming community.
2167029	2168690	I like the violent stuff.
2169290	2170950	Who's the game?
2171290	2172751	A couple more stories here, you guys.
2173031	2176232	PlayStation 3 will not be coming out with a hard drive.
2176372	2179293	Xbox 360, they are saying they're going to do a 20 gig hard drive.
2179613	2182174	PlayStation 3, nope, not coming with it.
2182254	2187775	There will be a slot where you can put in an 80 gig hard drive a little later on, but no hard drive in the outset.
2188415	2193557	To me, this is kind of striking me as these stories are really kind of a bigger deal than I think they ought to be.
2194652	2214814	I think it just really depends on the games that are coming out if the games come out and they don't require a hard drive because none of the games they have out right now really require a hard drive console wise save maybe Final Fantasy 11 a couple other exceptions that's all you need that's all the gaming system needs to be successful are good games right
2216039	2217380	And I only use it for that.
2242734	2243174	Koji Sugitani
2262837	2269479	He is a video game voice actor, and he contributed to Xenosaga, and he said in his blog, I'm doing another one.
2269840	2273541	So he kind of let the cat out of the bag that there is a Xenosaga 3 on the way.
2273761	2275201	I think we kind of figured that.
2275241	2276762	Yeah, I think we kind of figured that.
2276822	2285805	Namco, by the way, not making any official statement on that, but in the blog it says he has begun recording work for the next installment in the series.
2286165	2290987	Kind of not a big surprise, but I'm sure a lot of fans will be happy to know that yes, it is indeed happening.
2292262	2297803	And lastly tonight, a story about a gaming company called Left Behind Games.
2298484	2300264	You might know the term Left Behind.
2300304	2306325	It's a famous book series that's big in the Christian and religious world.
2306706	2312327	It's about what happened after the rapture, basically, and those folks that were left behind after the rapture.
2312567	2313687	Burn and inhale!
2314507	2315568	Well, get this.
2315688	2320989	They are making a PC game based on those novels.
2322984	2323725	Not surprising.
2324045	2325466	I don't know how that's going to work.
2326186	2336814	But it seems like now a lot of sites out there and blogs are saying that, hmm, between this and you saw at E3, Natsumi had made the Bible game, which was like Jeopardy for Bibles.
2337275	2340237	It's kind of like Christian gaming is making this big comeback.
2340277	2342279	You know what, didn't we already have Black Matrix?
2343319	2345301	I wish that Black Matrix would come out in the States.
2345701	2349744	Honestly, I mean, go ahead and make a Bible game.
2349964	2350765	I mean, why not?
2351371	2359013	I mean, people are going to play it, and you've got the small following that follows the whole Left Behind series and whatnot.
2360413	2360813	Go ahead.
2360853	2364694	If you think you're going to make some money off of it, more power to you.
2364774	2368595	But if it fails, well, we just told you so.
2369336	2371656	Here's my last question to you guys, and then we'll wrap up the show.
2371836	2378978	Is this a good thing or a bad thing for gaming, or does it strictly depend on how the game is?
2380801	2386005	I think honestly it's not going to be good or bad for gaming.
2386265	2390548	It's basically whether people are going to buy into it or not.
2391609	2395192	It's not a matter of whether this is going to be good or bad for gaming.
2395832	2400095	It's just how many people are going to be behind this type of game.
2402537	2408942	It's just really depending on how much of a following you have for this type of thing.
2409873	2414397	Really, other than that, you know, that's the only thing that's going to be depending on how good it's going to be.
2414637	2418160	I mean, because if you have a good following behind it, it's going to be good.
2418280	2419781	Otherwise, it's going to suck.
2420582	2420902	You know what?
2420962	2428888	I say it's a good thing for gaming because it'll take people's attention, certain people who need their attention taken away from games like Grand Theft Auto.
2429008	2432852	Because there's people out there, they seriously are in this mindset that all video games are violent.
2433312	2434273	All video games are violent.
2434333	2434653	No, no, no.
2435113	2438136	Video games, movies, art in any form.
2438156	2438436	Good.
2441097	2443718	Art in any form is what you want it to be.
2444558	2452400	And if this can show people, certain people that need to see this, and I'm not saying that every Christian needs to see this.
2452420	2454081	That's not what I'm saying.
2454101	2462063	I'm saying certain hardcore people that are out there that are saying video games are just, they're all violent and they're all plaguing society.
2462443	2467505	If this will help people see that not all video games have to be violent, then I say it's a good thing.
2468883	2472005	You know, this is what I say being an artist myself.
2473526	2479108	The goal of an artist, in the end, is to provoke a reaction.
2480129	2487212	Whether you are offended by it, whether you don't like it, whether you love it, have a positive reaction.
2488718	2503211	Getting that reaction, getting feedback on that reaction, that is a goal of an artist because they know that their work, be it a video game, be it a piece of visual art or written, they know that their piece created that response.
2504032	2506674	Apathy is the worst thing an artist can have.
2507134	2510217	So then are we in agreement that video game creators are in fact artists?
2510678	2511138	I do agree.
2511999	2512279	Loki?
2512619	2515622	To a certain extent, I would assume, but you know.
2516829	2521672	I mean, let's not go crazy and assume that they're artists just because they create a video game.
2522013	2524514	I think it's art just in another form.
2525315	2525975	In a sense.
2526035	2530258	I mean, let's not go crazy with saying that... You have writing involved.
2530978	2531919	You have art involved.
2531979	2534021	It's not the Mona Lisa, okay?
2534121	2534401	No.
2534921	2535742	It's an art form.
2536042	2538283	It's not fine art, but it's art.
2538443	2539864	Art is a way of expressing yourself, right?
2539964	2543467	It's a combination of visual art... I'd be willing to go that far.
2543707	2546249	It's a combination of visual art, dramatic arts,
2547229	2551491	You know, because you've got the acting that goes into the game, the storytelling aspect of it.
2552152	2554153	And you also have the audio art.
2555133	2556594	Because you have music in the games.
2557154	2559015	It is an overall work of art.
2560225	2561646	Some very deep subjects tonight.
2561666	2562366	Final Fantasy.
2563206	2566488	Is this a post-drunk and lethargic talk or something?
2566548	2567388	I don't know what it is.
2567448	2572630	Honestly, I have no freaking clue what the hell we've been talking about.
2572810	2575171	The legal chat, I think, got my brain working.
2575211	2580334	If you were to ask me what we talked about in this podcast, I would have no clue.
2580394	2582575	You can listen to it all week long and hear what an ass you were.
2583675	2585560	Why am I wearing this shirt?
2593891	2596111	Let's wrap up the show, please.
2596131	2597952	And ribbons in both.
2598052	2600472	The video games are a good thing to end on.
2600572	2601792	Loki throwing up on himself.
2601912	2603113	Not so good a note to end on.
2603153	2603653	So let's go ahead.
2603913	2606653	Video games, art, yay, happy, shiny.
2606993	2607313	All right.
2607613	2608354	Final thoughts.
2608414	2609334	Loki, your final thought.
2609474	2614315	My final thought is I need to pace myself with as far as drinking goes.
2615015	2621236	And maybe next time, you know, ice would be a little bit better in my drinks because, you know, the warm drinks aren't that great.
2621276	2621456	But...
2622697	2623118	I don't know.
2623719	2627286	I was able to handle my alcohol a lot better in San Diego and I don't know why.
2627506	2632255	I guess they were just skipping on the alcohol, but I don't know.
2632896	2633037	Yeah.
2633780	2637583	My final thought is I'm very much looking forward to seeing the letter bag this week, the mail bag.
2637924	2639645	I hope you guys write some good emails this week.
2639685	2640246	Can't wait to read them.
2640526	2642528	And sorry to those of you who didn't get your emails read on air.
2642848	2644790	We try to be fair and just select a couple.
2644830	2649253	Yeah, but I reply to everybody who emails me except for the really dumb.
2650234	2652536	And there's a lot of stuff going on in the PSP world.
2652616	2656279	I'm sure I didn't cover it because I don't remember covering it.
2656460	2657781	Get to it next week when you're sober.
2657821	2661484	Honestly, folks, I mean, there's a lot of cool stuff going on in the PSP world.
2661960	2665362	Just, you know, check it out on PSPUpdates.com.
2665662	2666963	A lot of good stuff on there.
2666983	2668463	DSupdates.com.
2668904	2669944	A lot of good stuff on there.
2670424	2673286	They're actually doing 360updates.com and whatnot.
2673746	2677088	But you're going to find some good stuff on there, so check it out.
2677588	2679009	All right, DarkSakura, your final thought.
2679440	2685107	Reject false icons and next summer I will be in London for a couple days.
2686008	2690554	So I would love to meet up with some of our UK listeners and interview a couple of them.
2690774	2693337	I'm going to be on the East Coast in a couple weeks, but I'll give more details on that later.
2693998	2696441	I will also be in France and I will also be in Italy.
2697042	2697462	Lucky!
2698484	2700625	I'm going to be chaperoning high school students.
2701105	2701766	Oh, sounds like fun.
2701806	2702106	All right.
2702146	2702346	All right.
2702386	2703046	Let's wrap it up.
