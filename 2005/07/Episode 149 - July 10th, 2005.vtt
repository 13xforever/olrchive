Yes.

05:07.600 --> 05:09.600
Yeah.

05:09.600 --> 05:14.600
Yeah, because our chat room loves to hear the two songs overlapping each other.

05:14.600 --> 05:15.600
Very nice.

05:15.600 --> 05:16.600
How are you doing, Tech Massa Loki?

05:16.600 --> 05:17.600
I'm doing good.

05:17.600 --> 05:18.600
I'm glad to hear that.

05:18.600 --> 05:19.600
How are you feeling?

05:19.600 --> 05:20.600
I'm fine.

05:20.600 --> 05:21.600
Did you...

05:21.600 --> 05:23.600
How many times did you ralph after the show was over?

05:23.600 --> 05:24.600
Um...

05:24.600 --> 05:28.000
I don't remember too much, whatever was here

05:28.000 --> 05:32.200
and then that was it. Alright, we'll get to that a little later. Also,

05:32.200 --> 05:35.440
joining us at least for a little bit, she's about to go run and get some ice cream,

05:35.440 --> 05:35.820
but

05:35.820 --> 05:39.680
the official lesbian of Orange Lounge Radio,

05:39.680 --> 05:42.720
did we give you a nickname? Precious Amanda.

05:42.720 --> 05:46.160
And Mandarin, or Manders, whatever.

05:46.160 --> 05:50.240
But you have a follow-up to this, don't you? I'm not a lesbian anymore.

05:50.240 --> 05:53.960
As the straight listeners

05:53.960 --> 05:58.080
breathe a sigh of disappointment. What happened?

05:58.080 --> 06:03.720
She wasn't very nice.

06:03.720 --> 06:09.320
We didn't work out. She ruined it for everyone.

06:09.320 --> 06:13.560
Pretty much. Chicks are still hot, but I have a boyfriend

06:13.560 --> 06:16.640
and yeah. Alright. I like dick.

06:16.640 --> 06:21.120
Alright. Go eat ice cream. I like the cod. Get off our show.

06:21.120 --> 06:22.120
Bye.

06:22.120 --> 06:23.120
Alright.

06:23.120 --> 06:27.480
Also joining us, DDR Angel is here for the first time in a while.

06:27.480 --> 06:28.720
God, I love her shirt too.

06:28.720 --> 06:29.720
That's so hilarious.

06:29.720 --> 06:30.720
Hi, I'm back.

06:30.720 --> 06:31.720
Oh my God.

06:31.720 --> 06:32.720
I love that shirt.

06:32.720 --> 06:35.720
Where did you get that shirt?

06:35.720 --> 06:39.000
Uh, thank you.com.

06:39.000 --> 06:42.240
For those that, obviously this is radio, so you can't exactly see her shirt.

06:42.240 --> 06:45.040
She's got a Domo-kun shirt on, but it's like all brown.

06:45.040 --> 06:46.040
Oh, it's cute.

06:46.040 --> 06:47.040
I like it.

06:47.040 --> 06:48.040
Baby panda born.

06:48.040 --> 06:49.040
Anyway.

06:49.040 --> 06:52.880
Orange, meeting the news is a baby panda.

We'll be back after this.

07:08.720 --> 07:09.720

07:09.720 --> 07:21.720
Come on baby, let's dream a dream together. A dream that is real.

07:21.720 --> 07:34.720
Don't die, don't die. Don't die, don't die. Don't die, don't die. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

07:34.720 --> 07:38.080
Oh, one more time, come back with a new rhyme

09:04.240 --> 09:05.960
And if he don't change, he'll be crying, boy.

09:05.960 --> 09:06.940
And something ain't right.

09:06.960 --> 09:07.920
And you know it, boy.

09:07.920 --> 09:09.380
That's probably why sheICES you're behind him, boy.

09:09.380 --> 09:11.700

Happy Sunday to you guys out there.

13:40.460 --> 13:43.060
I can't believe it's already like mid-July.

13:43.060 --> 13:44.620
Where did this year go?

13:44.620 --> 13:50.260
It seems like it's just, I feel my age slipping away as the days keep flying by.

13:50.260 --> 13:52.540
Is anyone else feeling incredibly old this evening?

13:52.540 --> 13:53.420
Maybe it's just me.

13:53.420 --> 13:54.420
No.

13:54.420 --> 13:55.060
It's just you.

13:55.060 --> 13:55.900
No.

13:55.900 --> 13:57.180
All right.

13:57.180 --> 13:57.680
Hey, Rob.

13:57.680 --> 13:58.180
What?

13:58.180 --> 13:58.680
Rob.

13:58.680 --> 13:59.180
What?

13:59.180 --> 13:59.680
Rob.

13:59.680 --> 14:00.180
What?

14:00.180 --> 14:00.680
Rob.

14:00.680 --> 14:01.180
What?

14:01.180 --> 14:01.680
Rob.

14:01.680 --> 14:02.680
Bitch.

14:02.680 --> 14:03.680
So?

14:03.680 --> 14:04.680
Kisses?

14:04.680 --> 14:11.940
Okay, um, first off, I want to thank, I want to thank Loki, I want to give hearts to Loki

14:11.940 --> 14:16.600
because he got me a late birthday present, he bought me Kirby Canvas Curse, the DS, and

14:16.600 --> 14:20.080
you can paint rainbows in that game, so I'm very excited to go paint me some rainbows,

14:20.080 --> 14:21.080
so that'll be fun.

14:21.080 --> 14:22.080
Thank you, Loki!

14:22.080 --> 14:23.080
You're welcome.

14:23.080 --> 14:25.400
As soon as I get paid, I can get your present, but I've been sort of busy moving.

14:25.400 --> 14:27.400
Well, you did give me the seatbelts, and-

14:27.400 --> 14:29.200
I gave you last year's present.

14:29.200 --> 14:32.980
Those are pretty nifty, except I've kind of been afraid to actually put them in my car

14:32.980 --> 14:35.620
because I'm afraid they'll get stolen.

14:35.620 --> 14:38.220
But I'm going to put them in there now that the glass is replaced, I'm going to put them

14:38.220 --> 14:40.260
in there because they just replaced my glass yesterday.

14:40.260 --> 14:41.260
Cool.

14:41.260 --> 14:45.400
So I just hope my freaking car doesn't get broken into again, except I will be getting

14:45.400 --> 14:46.400
an alarm this week.

14:46.400 --> 14:49.160
I've gotten some leads on some good deals and I'm very excited.

14:49.160 --> 14:53.560
For those that are not sure where I'm going with this, my car was broken into.

14:53.560 --> 14:57.780
I've lived in this new place where we're doing the show now about, what, about two and a

14:57.780 --> 14:58.780
half months.

14:58.780 --> 15:01.740
The car's been broken into twice in that span of time.

15:01.740 --> 15:03.140
I've had two stereos stolen.

15:03.140 --> 15:06.420
The first time, it was funny, because my stereo was actually broken.

15:06.420 --> 15:07.940
So the thieves stole a broken stereo.

15:07.940 --> 15:11.620
Second time, not so funny, because they stole a perfectly fine working stereo

15:11.620 --> 15:13.820
and decided to break some glass.

15:13.820 --> 15:15.700
And they screwed up the lock on my car.

15:15.700 --> 15:18.360
So I have to climb my big butt over the passenger seat

15:18.360 --> 15:19.820
every time I want to get in the car.

15:19.820 --> 15:23.900
That's payback for having a broken stereo the first time

15:23.900 --> 15:25.620
they broke into your car.

15:25.620 --> 15:27.080
That's what everybody's telling me.

15:27.080 --> 15:29.080
You were being watched.

15:29.080 --> 15:31.080
I'm making a new volume.

15:31.080 --> 15:33.080
No, you're fine. You sound great.

15:33.080 --> 15:35.080
Just so you guys know, I have headphones now.

15:35.080 --> 15:37.080
I finally replaced my headphones after like a month.

15:37.080 --> 15:39.080
So I turned the in-studio down.

15:39.080 --> 15:41.080
That's hardly fair to the rest of us because now I can't hear myself.

15:41.080 --> 15:43.080
Do you want me to turn this up?

15:43.080 --> 15:44.080
A little.

15:44.080 --> 15:45.080
Okay, I thought you didn't like it when I...

15:45.080 --> 15:47.080
Well, because you talk like you're screaming into the microphone.

15:47.080 --> 15:49.080
Oh, I'm sorry.

15:49.080 --> 15:51.080
You big old loudmouth.

15:51.080 --> 15:53.080
We can leave the door unlocked for weeks and no one will come in.

15:53.080 --> 15:55.080
I know you had the same luck I was having at your old place.

15:55.080 --> 15:57.080
Because the old place I lived in was a big sack of shit.

15:57.080 --> 15:59.080
That's the truth.

15:59.080 --> 16:01.080
Now that you're not living there anymore, do you want to give them a shout-out?

16:01.080 --> 16:03.080
Where not to move?

16:03.080 --> 16:05.080
Never live at St. Tropez Apartments on the corner of Garfield and Marconi and...

16:05.080 --> 16:07.080
I don't know.

16:07.080 --> 16:09.080
I don't know.

16:09.080 --> 16:11.080
I don't know.

16:11.080 --> 16:13.080
I don't know.

16:13.080 --> 16:15.080
I don't know.

16:15.080 --> 16:17.080
I don't know.

16:17.080 --> 16:19.080
I don't know.

16:19.080 --> 16:25.840
of Garfield and Marconi in Carmichael. That place is a festering pile of dog crap with

16:25.840 --> 16:34.840
worms in it. Even worse, it's the waste put off by a tapeworm. And tapeworms eat waste.

16:34.840 --> 16:40.120
Alright, Stalker fans, she doesn't live there anymore, so it's waste squared. It's waste

16:40.120 --> 16:47.700
times infinity. It's super waste. It's Ooberpoo! It's waste extreme. Uh-uh, no, it's Ooberpoo.

16:47.700 --> 16:49.700
And a Miro presents, Pump It Up, Waste.

16:49.700 --> 16:54.700
Hey, I saw Pump It Up, um, the new Pump It Up, in, uh, Vegas, in Reno.

16:54.700 --> 16:57.700
Like, exceed five million, what are they up to?

16:57.700 --> 17:00.700
I just sorta walked past it and go, huh, and then...

17:00.700 --> 17:02.700
You didn't get up there and play some Run To You?

17:02.700 --> 17:04.700
Actually, I don't think Run To You is a new one.

17:04.700 --> 17:06.700
It's not in there. Therefore, it's no longer worth playing.

17:06.700 --> 17:09.700
There's gotta be some K... I don't call it K-Pop, I call it K-Booty.

17:09.700 --> 17:11.700
There's gotta be some K-Booty in there.

17:11.700 --> 17:15.700
Um, no, I ended up winning plushies out of the Crane Games.

17:15.700 --> 17:17.500
Oh, well that's fun too, I guess.

17:17.500 --> 17:21.660
I have one of the Donkey Dragons from, you know, whatever spawn of Donkey and Dragon

17:21.660 --> 17:22.660
from Shrek 2.

17:22.660 --> 17:23.660
Oh.

17:23.660 --> 17:24.660
I have one of the Donkey Dragons.

17:24.660 --> 17:25.660
Cute.

17:25.660 --> 17:26.660
And a Hello Kitty!

17:26.660 --> 17:27.660
Aww.

17:27.660 --> 17:29.700
I love Hello Kitty.

17:29.700 --> 17:31.700
And I got, what else did I get?

17:31.700 --> 17:32.700
I got one more.

17:32.700 --> 17:37.420
Oh yeah, I played, you know those games where you play basketball, you know, you pay fifty

17:37.420 --> 17:39.620
cents and if you hoop you get some type of plushie?

17:39.620 --> 17:40.620
I got a plushie fish.

17:40.620 --> 17:41.620
Cool.

17:41.620 --> 17:42.620
So I beat Julie in the head with it.

17:42.620 --> 17:49.320
Well, just because I felt inspired by our chat room with the, uh, slap command, I told

17:49.320 --> 17:52.040
Julie that it was my homage to the radio station.

17:52.040 --> 17:53.040
Your trout command?

17:53.040 --> 17:54.040
Yeah.

17:54.040 --> 17:55.040
Slaps Julie with a large trout?

17:55.040 --> 17:57.040
It's slap.

17:57.040 --> 17:58.040
Where is...

17:58.040 --> 17:59.760
Julie hasn't been to the show for a while.

17:59.760 --> 18:01.720
This is because Julie's lazy.

18:01.720 --> 18:03.400
Julie, stop being lazy.

18:03.400 --> 18:04.400
Come visit us.

18:04.400 --> 18:06.920
We love you, Julie, but you're lazy.

18:06.920 --> 18:07.920
Okay.

18:07.920 --> 18:11.600
Thank you for driving, but next time I drive, because your car...

18:11.600 --> 18:14.360
Lou's car is the suck going uphill.

18:14.360 --> 18:17.120
She has to turn off the air conditioner.

18:17.120 --> 18:18.480
Oh, it's one of those cars.

18:18.480 --> 18:20.400
She's like, I love my fuel efficient car.

18:20.400 --> 18:22.720
Fuel efficient, fuel efficient.

18:22.720 --> 18:27.840
I like my car that accelerates up hills and doesn't lose speed.

18:27.840 --> 18:29.840
And I don't have to turn off the air conditioner.

18:29.840 --> 18:32.600
It may eat gas, but god damn it, my car is bad.

18:32.600 --> 18:34.080
I drive the Renos a bitch, too.

18:34.080 --> 18:35.720
All right, anyway, since you're already

18:35.720 --> 18:37.360
kind of talking about your weekend,

18:37.360 --> 18:39.240
I might as well ask you, how was your week?

18:39.240 --> 18:41.040
How was your day, Dark Sakura?

18:41.040 --> 18:42.040
It was awesome.

18:42.040 --> 18:47.160
Well, my week was kind of, ugh, but the rest of the week was pretty cute.

18:47.160 --> 18:50.560
So I saw George Carlin last night and he was freaking awesome, but all he did was talk

18:50.560 --> 18:54.760
about suicide and natural disasters and how it was cool to watch people die.

18:54.760 --> 18:59.840
I was like, okay, but it was really funny, but the thing that kind of got me is that

18:59.840 --> 19:10.360
he was learning his new material for the 13th HBO special coming up and he kept reading

19:10.360 --> 19:13.860
off paper the whole time I was like I feel kind of unprofessional but hey he's

19:13.860 --> 19:25.420
been doing it for what 50 years he's entitled I guess um I also um you know

19:25.420 --> 19:31.980
we went to the the nice places to eat at the silver legacy in Reno and every

19:31.980 --> 19:38.060
freaking thing I ate made me sick so I've decided I'm never eating again but

19:38.060 --> 19:42.640
you were chopping on nuts earlier nuts don't count yeah I like to eat nuts I

19:42.640 --> 19:49.840
bet um but no my ways of combating it are basically I'm gonna be fasting for

19:49.840 --> 19:56.780
the next three days like eating when I really have to and drinking like this

19:56.780 --> 20:02.080
tea that's supposed to every and I think it's just because I think that I've got

20:02.080 --> 20:05.380
like a toxic buildup or something and last time I did that I ate a lot of

20:05.380 --> 20:12.380
garlic and drink this tea and drink a lot of water and it cleared everything up so hopefully

20:13.300 --> 20:20.300
I won't have any nasty blood poisoning or anything. Hope not. I mean that could be kind

20:20.300 --> 20:24.000
of dangerous but just take care of yourself. As I said earlier you might want to consult

20:24.000 --> 20:29.000
the doctor. Yeah, I'm tired of going to the doctor. My butt's finally healed. I'm sorry

20:29.000 --> 20:32.000
I'm sorry, my hip. Mostly.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
Sounded a little foul there for a minute.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
You know what?

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
What?

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
I'm going to throw this ferret at you.

20:37.000 --> 20:40.000
Jamie's butt?

20:40.000 --> 20:41.000
Rob?

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
What?

20:43.000 --> 20:47.000
I got the finger.

20:47.000 --> 20:50.000
Alright, anything else you want to share?

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
No.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
Loki, how was your week, how was your day?

20:53.000 --> 21:03.000
Um, it was good. I've been working, doing the work stuff, and... I don't know, I've just been kind of...

21:03.000 --> 21:11.000
We went and met with another rabbi yesterday and found one, and guess what? He's an ex-pro-wrestler.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
Why did he wrestle as?

21:13.000 --> 21:17.000
I don't know, but it was a long time ago, like, you know, back in the day.

21:17.000 --> 21:28.000
you know, back when professional wrestling was just coming about, not like, you know, WWE type stuff, but like, you know, back, you know, with spandex suits, you know, that type of thing.

21:28.000 --> 21:46.000
So, um, yeah, ex-pro wrestler. That was kinda cool. And, um, then what else? Oh, just been, um, oh, I was sticking around the house and stuff, playing with my PSP, and doing things with the PSP that...

21:46.000 --> 21:50.000
Playing with the PSP and doing things with the PSP?

21:50.000 --> 21:54.000
They're borderline illegal, you know, that type of thing.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
I see.

21:56.000 --> 22:03.000
I have right now, I have games on my PSP and stuff, and a lot of fun stuff like that.

22:03.000 --> 22:10.000
And then I've been playing games on my PlayStation 2, like I picked up Killer7, and that's sweet.

22:10.000 --> 22:15.000
How is that? Well, I guess you can talk about it later on the podcast, but give me a brief rundown. How is that?

22:15.000 --> 22:18.000
It's psychotic. It's the best way to describe it.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
I'm really curious about that game. I want to pick that one up.

22:20.000 --> 22:27.000
It plays well. Everyone's griping about the control scheme on it, but it reminds me of, like, almost like Alone in the Dark, in a sense.

22:27.000 --> 22:39.000
But it's very, very psychotic, and I've only been playing it for, like, I'm only in the second level, and it makes little sense, but you sort of get what the story's going on.

22:39.000 --> 22:44.300
Apparently, well, I can't really spoil anything, but based on some of the notes that you get

22:44.300 --> 22:50.140
and stuff, it makes you feel like that you yourself are another one of his personalities,

22:50.140 --> 22:53.680
the character that you're playing, who has seven different personalities.

22:53.680 --> 22:58.320
And it's just psychotic, and there's a bunch of people that you talk to.

22:58.320 --> 23:02.280
It reminds me also of kind of like a Japanese anime movie or something, because there's

23:02.280 --> 23:06.060
this severed head that you talk to now and then, then there's this guy that helps you

23:06.060 --> 23:08.820
who is like on some string, looks like a corpse.

23:08.820 --> 23:13.540
There's some other dead guy that you talk to, a bunch of weird shit like that, and it's

23:13.540 --> 23:14.540
just psychotic.

23:14.540 --> 23:16.180
Just go play, it's fun.

23:16.180 --> 23:17.860
Alright, I'm curious about this game.

23:17.860 --> 23:20.100
There's not a whole lot of games that have come out lately.

23:20.100 --> 23:24.060
I found myself very challenged this week trying to find something new, because I try to play

23:24.060 --> 23:30.240
at least one new game every week for the podcast, so I have something new to talk about, but

23:30.240 --> 23:34.420
there really wasn't a whole lot new for me to get this week, so I had to go get something

23:34.420 --> 23:35.980
I would never usually play.

23:35.980 --> 23:38.580
So, I'll get to that later though.

23:38.580 --> 23:41.580
Anything else you want to share about your week here today?

23:41.580 --> 23:43.580
Just that I've been playing a lot of PSP games.

23:43.580 --> 23:44.580
I've got follow-up questions for you, though.

23:44.580 --> 23:46.580
What happened after last week's show? I've got to know.

23:46.580 --> 23:50.580
Your family was listening. How was the next day? How was the Fourth of July for you?

23:50.580 --> 23:55.580
It was fine. They didn't really bring it up. It was just kind of funny.

23:55.580 --> 24:01.580
And that was pretty much it. I didn't have a hangover. Just slept it off.

24:01.580 --> 24:05.580
Just also a follow-up for our listeners, if you were listening last week.

24:05.580 --> 24:06.700
you were listening last week.

24:06.700 --> 24:09.220
Here's what actually happened, OK?

24:09.220 --> 24:13.420
So every shot that I thought I was taking

24:13.420 --> 24:15.540
was not exactly a shot.

24:15.540 --> 24:19.020
Apparently, the glass I was using was not a shot glass.

24:19.020 --> 24:20.940
It was a double shot glass.

24:20.940 --> 24:24.020
And so it was kind of, and I was filling it to the brim.

24:24.020 --> 24:27.060
So it was about two and a half shots per shot that I thought

24:27.060 --> 24:28.060
I was taking.

24:28.060 --> 24:30.540
So for example, in the beginning of the show, I'm

24:30.540 --> 24:32.140
like, oh yeah, I'm down four shots.

24:32.140 --> 24:33.660
I was actually down eight shots.

24:33.660 --> 24:41.660
And so, by the end of the night, I think I was down 16 shots within about an hour, which is probably why I got sick.

24:41.660 --> 24:48.660
Or 16 or more shots, because I was gone, and to the point where actually I don't remember parts of the night, so...

24:48.660 --> 24:52.660
But, I remember most of it. It's just a lot of it's really fuzzy.

24:52.660 --> 24:54.660
Do you remember just kind of sitting here, chilling, and then all of a sudden...

24:54.660 --> 24:55.660
Yes!

24:56.660 --> 24:57.660
I remember that.

24:57.660 --> 25:01.660
We just got the stains cleaned up today. It's exciting.

25:01.660 --> 25:06.220
I remember that. Probably didn't help that I had like a big heaping bowl of

25:06.220 --> 25:10.220
ministering before I came over. That's just very acidic, especially on the carpet.

25:10.220 --> 25:14.860
So just to clarify guys, every time Matt said he was taking a double shot, he was

25:14.860 --> 25:19.020
actually having a double double shot, which is a quadruple shot, meaning when

25:19.020 --> 25:23.660
he said he had 10 shots, he really had 20. We're surprised he didn't end up in the

25:23.660 --> 25:27.260
hospital. So kids, here's the lesson to be learned. When

25:27.260 --> 25:30.380
you're drinking, and you're the only one drinking from a

25:30.380 --> 25:36.780
a bottle of vodka. When the bottle's halfway gone, that's a good clue to stop drinking.

25:36.780 --> 25:44.100
The bottle was pretty much gone by the time I was done. So, yeah, but, you know, you should

25:44.100 --> 25:47.060
stop, you should have stopped about halfway and then you would have had the, you know,

25:47.060 --> 25:55.740
bleh. Well, I know from now on. And going is half the battle. The more you know. G.I.

25:55.740 --> 25:56.740
go.

25:56.740 --> 25:57.740
Alright.

25:57.740 --> 25:59.740
So yeah, that's pretty much it.

25:59.740 --> 26:04.780
I was surprised I didn't have a hangover.

26:04.780 --> 26:06.860
Apparently I drank a lot of water here.

26:06.860 --> 26:08.100
I don't remember any of that.

26:08.100 --> 26:09.700
You did, you drank a lot of water.

26:09.700 --> 26:11.200
I don't remember any of that.

26:11.200 --> 26:13.340
We had to buy a new Brita filter because of you.

26:13.340 --> 26:14.340
No, I'm kidding.

26:14.340 --> 26:19.020
Honestly, I don't remember any of the drinking and water or pitchers or whatever, but I guess

26:19.020 --> 26:21.020
I did, so yeah.

26:21.020 --> 26:22.020
Alrighty.

26:22.020 --> 26:23.220
Anything else?

26:23.220 --> 26:30.020
The entire podcast, like I stated on the podcast, I did not remember any of the podcasts, so

26:30.020 --> 26:31.020
I had to listen to it.

26:31.020 --> 26:32.700
And what did you think when you were listening to it?

26:32.700 --> 26:36.060
I thought it was interesting because I'd say the same thing like three times in a row in

26:36.060 --> 26:38.140
all in one run-on sentence.

26:38.140 --> 26:43.820
Yeah, which made last week's podcast our longest podcast to date, thank you very much.

26:43.820 --> 26:47.980
It's like, you know, that game completely sucks.

26:47.980 --> 26:53.980
And I gotta tell you, that game completely sucks. And that game completely sucks.

26:53.980 --> 26:58.980
You know what? That's half the other video game podcasts out there, though. Honestly, if you listen to their reviews...

26:58.980 --> 27:00.980
Not to knock on the other podcasts, but...

27:00.980 --> 27:02.980
But I am.

27:02.980 --> 27:04.980
But I am. Sorry.

27:06.980 --> 27:08.980
Alright. Um...

27:09.980 --> 27:12.980
What? What? You were gonna say something? Come on. Out with it.

27:12.980 --> 27:14.980
I'm gonna be nice today.

27:14.980 --> 27:17.980
Please, please, be mean, be vicious.

27:17.980 --> 27:22.980
You are a lame-ass drunk.

27:22.980 --> 27:24.980
See, that was funny.

27:24.980 --> 27:26.980
All right.

27:26.980 --> 27:30.980
The hell did you want me to do? Like, jump up in the air, fly, spit fire, what?

27:30.980 --> 27:33.980
I don't know what the hell your expectations were.

27:33.980 --> 27:37.980
Didn't you see it when Dark Soccer was doing that last week?

27:37.980 --> 27:38.980
No?

27:38.980 --> 27:40.980
No, because you were sitting there staring at your toes.

27:40.980 --> 27:42.980
And me, I'm always on fire, so what can I say?

27:42.980 --> 27:43.980
You look so hot.

28:13.980 --> 28:14.980
I'm not gonna be...

28:14.980 --> 28:15.980
Another round.

28:15.980 --> 28:16.980
Um...

28:16.980 --> 28:21.740
You know, I noticed during the pre-show that some folks from my old link show, and they're

28:21.740 --> 28:26.900
probably trying to get me back, but I've gotta resist temptation.

28:26.900 --> 28:28.420
Yeah, we were talking about that.

28:28.420 --> 28:32.860
You know, I haven't cancelled my account for 5.5.11 or anything, so I can go back to that

28:32.860 --> 28:36.560
when I find the disc and install them and stuff.

28:36.560 --> 28:38.300
Do you want your World of Warcraft disc back, by the way?

28:38.300 --> 28:39.300
No, it's okay.

28:39.300 --> 28:41.860
I'll fix that later, too.

28:41.860 --> 28:46.260
I'm also going to plan on picking up Guild Wars this week too, so yay!

28:46.260 --> 28:51.700
Guild Wars was fun for me for like a week, and then I don't know, I just kinda...

28:51.700 --> 28:56.640
I didn't get it at the most, too much.

28:56.640 --> 28:58.600
That mic is screwy, we're going to have to replace it.

28:58.600 --> 29:02.780
I saw Guild Wars in action, and I thought it was okay.

29:02.780 --> 29:06.040
I don't care for the animation style in it.

29:06.040 --> 29:10.000
There's things I really like about Guild Wars, and that is no monthly fee,

29:10.000 --> 29:17.120
It's a very pretty looking game, and I like the, um, uh, like player versus player elements

29:17.120 --> 29:20.260
are actually really fun, so it's not a bad game.

29:20.260 --> 29:25.600
I just, for some reason, I could not immerse myself in that the way I could Final Fantasy.

29:25.600 --> 29:27.220
I have a PSO.

29:27.220 --> 29:29.220
I'm fine with PSO.

29:29.220 --> 29:31.220
Alrighty.

29:31.220 --> 29:37.020
And I got some DS games this week that I will probably touch on a little bit later, assuming

29:37.020 --> 29:45.900
we get to play it um but uh medios and uh i got to watch a bunch of like uh well stuff

29:45.900 --> 29:51.940
that's been around for a while we had a trial of a everquest 2 and so andrew was like trying

29:51.940 --> 29:56.180
that out and i was watching that for a little bit and it's just you know i've just been

29:56.180 --> 29:59.340
i've been in the game scene but out of the game scene at the same time if that makes

29:59.340 --> 30:03.460
sense i don't know if i should admit this but i've actually been really curious about

30:03.460 --> 30:08.820
I request to and I kind of want to try it out. I think PC gamer has like a trial disk or something anyway

30:10.460 --> 30:12.620
What do you want to be fat and lazy?

30:13.860 --> 30:16.500
Come on. No no no the funny thing about

30:17.260 --> 30:23.140
Andrew trying the 30-day trial or not or whatever the little trial disk was as soon as he installed it as soon as he logged

30:23.140 --> 30:29.340
In he looks at me with this you know Andrew look and he's like hmm slash pizza. I'm like shut up

30:29.900 --> 30:31.900
It's funny

30:31.900 --> 30:36.980
Is that slash pizza thing for real? I think so. We didn't try it though.

30:36.980 --> 30:40.820
I was kind of hoping it was this big urban legend online or something.

30:40.820 --> 30:44.820
No luck. Alright, my week and my day. Oh, I'm sorry. Is that it?

30:44.820 --> 30:49.580
Yeah, that's it pretty much. My week and my day. It was okay. You know what, since I didn't really have

30:49.580 --> 30:53.460
the car to drive around in me. I had a car but I couldn't really take it anywhere

30:53.460 --> 30:53.820
because

30:53.820 --> 30:57.140
it was not safe to leave in a parking lot with no window.

30:57.140 --> 31:00.980
Besides my work parking lot because they have cameras there. I really didn't do an awful lot.

31:00.980 --> 31:07.440
I just kind of sat on my big butt and you know sniff. I know actually I have a couple of my friends took me places

31:07.440 --> 31:10.160
So I was able to get out of the house at least like once in a while, which is good

31:11.160 --> 31:14.120
But some things I did while I was sitting at home all sad and lonely

31:14.120 --> 31:20.040
Um, I I am obsessed with this program called Google Earth. Oh, yeah

31:20.040 --> 31:24.880
I was playing with that last night and I downloaded it but I haven't done anything since I've been so busy. I

31:24.880 --> 31:30.300
I seriously it is my new time waster like I will sit here and I will just go

31:30.300 --> 31:34.360
on Google Earth here's what Google Earth is basically they bought this program or

31:34.360 --> 31:38.620
this software called keyhole and now they're giving it away for three free

31:38.620 --> 31:42.100
and basically what it is it's very similar to Google Maps how you have the

31:42.100 --> 31:45.540
satellite views on Google Maps and it's fun to like try and find your house and

31:45.540 --> 31:50.460
stuff but imagine that but like the size of the world like I was traveling to

31:50.460 --> 31:54.260
Tokyo and I was looking at the maps of Tokyo and I was looking at Moscow and

31:54.260 --> 31:59.980
like, all these crazy places, right? It's a way to, like, travel the world without leaving

31:59.980 --> 32:05.500
your chair, which I'm sure would be a great marketing slogan for them, but I just, I find

32:05.500 --> 32:08.540
myself fascinated just looking at different places. I'm like, I wonder what the border

32:08.540 --> 32:11.980
to Mexico looks like, because I've never been there. And, like, I'll look along the Mexican

32:11.980 --> 32:14.340
and border, see if I can see any people. No, I'm kidding. But...

32:14.340 --> 32:18.340
The White House is pixeled out? Yeah, the White House is pixelated out, which

32:18.340 --> 32:22.980
I think is very interesting. But it's also that way, if I remember right, on Google satellite

32:22.980 --> 32:27.360
maps too because they don't want bad people to find it actually to add to

32:27.360 --> 32:32.460
that like the second search Andrew did he was like hmm let's see if I could do

32:32.460 --> 32:42.160
troop movements I'm like shut up he was just being silly but I mean like now I'm

32:42.160 --> 32:46.200
using it no like I'm using Google Earth to do research like for instance neon FM

32:46.200 --> 32:51.060
they had an address on their website like contact us if you want to be a beta

32:51.060 --> 32:54.060
tester and I think it had an address on there so I was like I wonder if this is

32:54.060 --> 32:56.980
some dude's apartment or if this is like a legit business so I put in the address

32:56.980 --> 33:01.400
and Google her and I looked at it and I couldn't tell it was kind of like I

33:01.400 --> 33:05.380
couldn't tell if it was it's either like it's either a business complex or it's

33:05.380 --> 33:10.860
like duplexes type thing I don't know I I know that sounds very stalkerish but

33:10.860 --> 33:16.540
I'm very curious as somebody who is is part of a art startup business ourselves

33:16.540 --> 33:20.620
with Orange Lounge Radio kind of running it out of our apartments our address

33:20.620 --> 33:24.340
though I can't say the address where we live over the air but it sounds very

33:24.340 --> 33:27.580
corporate like the name of the street sounds like a street that would be

33:27.580 --> 33:30.940
downtown we have an apartment number so I think when people hear it it's also

33:30.940 --> 33:35.180
considering the location of what else is nearby true very true I actually live in

33:35.180 --> 33:40.140
a very commercial district part of town so very interesting so people might

33:40.140 --> 33:42.740
assume like when they see it on the business card like oh they're in a you

33:42.740 --> 33:46.260
know nice office not out of some schmoes apartment so this is really curious if

33:46.260 --> 33:49.460
that thing was being run out of somebody's apartment or duplex or if it

33:49.460 --> 33:52.260
was a legit office.

33:52.260 --> 33:52.700
I don't know.

33:52.700 --> 33:54.700
Am I crazy?

33:54.700 --> 33:57.620
Always, always crazy.

33:57.620 --> 34:03.140
Oh, our chat room says it is an actual office building.

34:03.140 --> 34:04.340
Sakurina says that.

34:04.340 --> 34:06.140
And there's pictures of it on popnco.com.

34:06.140 --> 34:08.220
See, I should have just done the research and followed the

34:08.220 --> 34:09.460
links the old fashioned way.

34:09.460 --> 34:10.260
That's not fun.

34:10.260 --> 34:11.980
I had to Google Earth it, because Google

34:11.980 --> 34:14.140
Earth is the new orange.

34:14.140 --> 34:15.620
I don't know.

34:15.620 --> 34:16.740
Google Earth is awesome.

34:16.740 --> 34:17.420
Here's the thing, though.

34:17.420 --> 34:19.780
You can't get it right now from Google's website

34:19.780 --> 34:21.460
because they said too many people have

34:21.460 --> 34:22.460
tried to download it.

34:22.460 --> 34:23.340
But here's the trick.

34:23.340 --> 34:26.420
Go to download.com and do a search for Google Earth,

34:26.420 --> 34:27.940
and you can get it that way still.

34:27.940 --> 34:30.140
Ha ha ha, fooled you, Google people.

34:30.140 --> 34:31.140
It's so much fun.

34:31.140 --> 34:33.300
I can't explain why it's so great.

34:33.300 --> 34:36.040
It's just so fun to just look at different areas

34:36.040 --> 34:39.100
and look at places I've traveled to and airports.

34:39.100 --> 34:39.820
It's fun.

34:39.820 --> 34:42.140
But warning, if you live in a rural area,

34:42.140 --> 34:44.260
your satellite pictures probably aren't very good.

34:44.260 --> 34:47.060
If you don't live within 50 miles of a major city,

34:47.060 --> 34:53.400
probably is just a big blur what your house looks like so all right um there

34:53.400 --> 34:58.240
was that and I have to I have to give a shout out to this because it's kind of

34:58.240 --> 35:02.480
DDR related it's a it's a game that's really really popular over on the DDR

35:02.480 --> 35:06.480
freak forums it's this game they play in random chat called the wolf game have

35:06.480 --> 35:10.820
you guys ever seen this oh yes it's kind of neat it's a fun little game that they

35:10.820 --> 35:14.440
play over in random chat and it's like I don't know how to I don't know how to

35:14.440 --> 35:19.760
explain it. It's like Survivor meets the Salem Witch Trials. I don't know, I really

35:19.760 --> 35:22.720
don't know how to explain it, but it's a forum game and it's kind of like you're trying to fool

35:22.720 --> 35:27.640
people into thinking you're human, but three or four players, depending on the

35:27.640 --> 35:30.680
game rules, are assigned to be a wolf and they're slowly killing off the other

35:30.680 --> 35:36.080
players. And then everybody else gets to lynch one person. It's kind of crazy.

35:36.080 --> 35:40.000
Go to DDR Free Granum Chat, look for any thread that starts with TWG and they've

35:40.000 --> 35:47.240
got rules posted. I played my first game and I lost. I lost. I can, I can talk about it

35:47.240 --> 35:48.240
now. Did you get lynched?

35:48.240 --> 35:53.520
I did not get lynched. I was a wolf and I got hit by the vigilante. There was an auxiliary

35:53.520 --> 35:56.320
role in the game. But the vigilante is a new thing.

35:56.320 --> 35:59.160
It's kind of like, I don't think it existed in the first few games. But the vigilante

35:59.160 --> 36:03.320
basically is a human that can take out any player at any time. And I got wasted and I

36:03.320 --> 36:07.840
was so pissed off because I didn't even remember that the game had one of those. But, you know,

36:07.840 --> 36:11.760
hats off to the guy that did it because basically he won it. See, he single-handedly won the

36:11.760 --> 36:18.680
game for the human team, so hats off to that guy. So, but it's a fun game. I endorse that

36:18.680 --> 36:23.200
forum game, although it took me like 36 games to finally jump in it. I thought it was fun,

36:23.200 --> 36:27.320
so I don't know. I just want to give a shout out to that because I like cute little forum

36:27.320 --> 36:36.100
games like that, so. Anyway, let's see. What else is there? Oh, I know. Let's have Orange

36:36.100 --> 36:39.100
Orange Lounge Radio Movie Time. How's that sound?

36:39.100 --> 36:40.100
Yay!

36:40.100 --> 36:45.100
Hey, I'm bitter about movies right now, because nobody will go see Land of the Dead with me.

36:45.100 --> 36:47.100
Aw, I'm sorry.

36:47.100 --> 36:49.100
I'm sad.

36:49.100 --> 36:52.100
Oh, I want to respond to some comments in the chat room there.

36:52.100 --> 36:55.100
OrangeLoungeRadio.com, click on chat.

36:55.100 --> 37:00.100
And if OrangeLoungeRadio.com is not working for you right now, some people are timing out when they hit it,

37:00.100 --> 37:03.100
you can view our chat room the old-fashioned way.

37:03.100 --> 37:09.580
connect to an other side IRC server. A good one would be, what's the one I'm on

37:09.580 --> 37:14.880
right now here, it's IRC.introversion.net if you have an IRC client and then join

37:14.880 --> 37:19.800
channel Orange Lounge. So that's that's the way to do it. But I did want to

37:19.800 --> 37:23.800
respond to some folks in the chat room there. The wolf game is an adapted

37:23.800 --> 37:30.160
version of another game called Mafia. Yeah, I forgot to mention that. So if you

37:30.160 --> 37:37.000
played a game called Mafia. He played a very similar game. Also, I think this game started

37:37.000 --> 37:41.780
in live action form. Like it's a popular live action role playing game. A LARP. It's a fun

37:41.780 --> 37:45.760
one night LARP-er, I think. So, something to think about there. So you might be more

37:45.760 --> 37:49.760
familiar with this game than you think. So, fun, fun, fun. Good times.

37:49.760 --> 37:54.540
Would that be that stupid game Poison where you're like shaking hands and stuff?

37:54.540 --> 37:56.640
I don't know. I've never played Poison.

37:56.640 --> 37:59.760
there's one person that's like the thief or whatever

37:59.760 --> 38:03.360
and they're shaking hands and after you shake hands with someone that's

38:03.360 --> 38:07.440
basically, the way you shake in their hand you put your middle finger out and

38:07.440 --> 38:07.760
like

38:07.760 --> 38:11.160
touch their wrist or whatever while you're doing it kind of like you know

38:11.160 --> 38:14.240
it's basically like you're injecting them with

38:14.240 --> 38:18.120
poison and then 10 seconds after you do that or whatever or like

38:18.120 --> 38:21.200
there's so much of a delay then they fall over and die

38:21.200 --> 38:25.200
and it's a drama game that you used to play and then you're supposed to figure out who the

38:25.200 --> 38:30.400
a thief is, or whatever. Somewhat similar. It's a slightly different setup, the game

38:30.400 --> 38:35.800
I played, but it's similar. Similar idea. You're on the right track. All right. Only

38:35.800 --> 38:41.680
LARP I ever did was Vampire. I never played a LARP. I played D&D in high school, like

38:41.680 --> 38:46.920
a couple times. I wasn't like a total dork, but I had- Hey! I was a- No, but I'm just-

38:46.920 --> 38:50.400
What dork you ever begun to do? I'm still doing tabletop gaming. There's not a problem

38:50.400 --> 38:52.400
Hey, Dork Pride, yo.

38:52.400 --> 38:54.400
I'm playing Buffy.

38:54.400 --> 38:55.400
Buffy TV.

38:55.400 --> 38:57.400
Please, please, come on.

38:57.400 --> 39:01.400
You have to admit, Buffy roleplay is a little bit dorky.

39:01.400 --> 39:02.400
But it's fun.

39:02.400 --> 39:03.400
That's fine.

39:03.400 --> 39:05.400
It's done like a TV episode, it's great.

39:05.400 --> 39:11.400
As somebody who co-hosts an internet radio show dedicated to DDR, that's fine.

39:11.400 --> 39:13.400
Don't make me go grudge on you.

39:13.400 --> 39:26.400
Now I'm having a problem finding that video I wanted to show you guys, I'm so upset.

39:26.400 --> 39:28.520
What else is new, Rob?

39:28.520 --> 39:29.520
Speaking of problems.

39:29.520 --> 39:30.520
Oh, I found it.

39:30.520 --> 39:34.120
Okay, so we love to do Orange Launch Radio movie time because it's really funny because

39:34.120 --> 39:35.120
we're a radio show.

39:35.120 --> 39:36.120
You guys can't see the movie.

39:36.120 --> 39:38.160
But the audio on this will say it all.

39:38.160 --> 39:42.440
So what we're going to look at is a download that's available on ebombsworld.com.

39:42.440 --> 39:46.440
It's a very popular site. It's a corporate training video for sexual harassment.

39:46.440 --> 39:49.440
I don't know if you guys have seen this, but it's fucking funny.

39:49.440 --> 39:51.440
I think I know what this is.

39:51.440 --> 39:54.440
It's probably Dave Chappelle.

39:54.440 --> 39:55.440
Listen to this.

39:55.440 --> 40:00.440
You hear about sexual harassment on TV, and it makes the headlines in newspapers.

40:00.440 --> 40:04.440
As an employee, what do you need to know about it?

40:04.440 --> 40:08.440
First, sexual harassment is against the law.

40:08.440 --> 40:11.440
And it's against your company's policy.

40:11.440 --> 40:14.440
So, what is sexual harassment?

40:14.440 --> 40:16.440
Linda, you are doing a fine job here.

40:16.440 --> 40:17.940
Oh, well, thank you, Steve.

40:17.940 --> 40:21.440
But you know, you might try dressing a little sexier at work.

40:21.440 --> 40:21.940
I'm sorry?

40:21.940 --> 40:26.440
I mean, we're talking about your job here.

40:26.440 --> 40:28.440
Angel, I want you to dress a little more sexier.

40:28.440 --> 40:30.940
There may be physical harassment.

40:30.940 --> 40:32.440
Wow.

40:32.440 --> 40:33.440
You're really tense today, Nancy.

40:33.440 --> 40:35.440
Ow, Bill.

40:35.440 --> 40:36.440
Sorry.

40:36.440 --> 40:38.440
Dude, Bill has no sense of hot.

40:38.440 --> 40:42.120
I really don't like it when you do that. Can you please stop?

40:42.120 --> 40:45.480
Dude, Bill, that's a dude.

40:45.480 --> 40:49.120
I'd be decking him. Because she looks like she's going to cry.

40:49.120 --> 40:53.160
Bill, that's a dude! Verbal has to be great.

40:53.160 --> 40:56.920
Word around the office is you've got a fat cock.

40:56.920 --> 40:58.600
Yes, I do.

40:58.600 --> 41:01.200
I've got a fat cock too.

41:01.200 --> 41:04.520
Maybe we should rub our fat cocks together sometime.

41:04.520 --> 41:06.280
Maybe a little oil.

41:06.280 --> 41:07.840
Two fat cocks.

41:07.840 --> 41:12.040
together, oil.

41:12.040 --> 41:15.440
It might be visual harassment such as derogatory posters,

41:15.440 --> 41:19.040
cartoons, or drawings.

41:19.040 --> 41:23.040
They have a little inflated penis on the desk.

41:23.040 --> 41:27.140
It may be the result of a power struggle between a manager and a subordinate.

41:27.140 --> 41:33.840
Man, I could go for a power fuck right now.

41:33.840 --> 41:37.520
change is slow and what was acceptable and here's the best part is the best part

41:37.520 --> 41:41.280
of the whole video ago can now be sexual harassment

41:41.280 --> 41:48.400
smells like vagina in here excuse me smells like fresh vagina in here are you

41:48.400 --> 41:55.520
talking about my vagina maybe everyone wants to be treated fairly and with

41:55.520 --> 41:59.720
respect are you talking about my vagina with the courtesy and respect that you

41:59.720 --> 42:05.480
you want for yourself. It's your company's policy, and it's the law.

42:05.480 --> 42:14.480
Ebaumsworld.com, E-B-A-U-M-S world dot com. Funniest damn thing I've seen all week, honestly.

42:14.480 --> 42:18.280
That was great. Seriously, it's basically what they did. I think they spliced, like,

42:18.280 --> 42:23.120
a real video with those, like, fake clips. Funny. Funny stuff. Love it.

42:23.120 --> 42:25.760
I'm... we're gonna pass it around at work now.

42:25.760 --> 42:31.200
Are you talking about my vagina?

42:31.200 --> 42:36.740
Maybe. Thank you, Paul, if you're listening. Paul's the one who sent that to me.

42:36.740 --> 42:41.120
What a nice guy. I've seen that one. Alright. For those of you guys that were good

42:41.120 --> 42:44.720
enough to sit through that Orange Lawns Radio Movie Time, I've got a special treat for

42:44.720 --> 42:45.840
you. We have

42:45.840 --> 42:49.480
a new song from We Love Katamari,

42:49.480 --> 42:52.960
the Japanese version. A buddy of mine picked it up and did a rip

42:52.960 --> 42:56.260
of the opening song. So you want to hear what this sounds like? One of the new songs from

42:56.260 --> 42:57.220
We Heart Katamari?

42:57.220 --> 43:00.220
Please, here it is. It's only a minute long, it's the introduction, here it is.

43:27.220 --> 43:29.220
I can't reach the sunshine

43:33.220 --> 43:36.220
Na na na na na na na na na na

43:36.220 --> 43:38.220
Katamari on the swing

43:42.220 --> 43:45.220
Na na na na na na na na na na

43:45.220 --> 43:47.220
Katamari on the swing

43:47.220 --> 43:52.220
Iwa, hajima, luyo, iwi, ito

43:52.220 --> 43:57.740
Fuck it all, yeah, you can't lose my love, baby

44:22.220 --> 44:23.660
Seriously, you can't.

44:23.660 --> 44:25.460
You can't.

44:25.460 --> 44:27.180
The sequels are never as good as the original.

44:27.180 --> 44:28.460
Well, the game might.

44:28.460 --> 44:31.220
Games are sometimes the exception of the rule there.

44:31.220 --> 44:32.900
Anyway, let me play just a little clip.

44:32.900 --> 44:34.620
This song is like six and a half minutes long, so I'm not

44:34.620 --> 44:35.980
going to subject you to this whole thing.

44:35.980 --> 44:36.940
But you have to hear this.

44:36.940 --> 44:40.940
This sounds like a guy that did a bunch of DER songs.

44:40.940 --> 44:41.300
It's not.

44:41.300 --> 44:42.100
It's actually a different guy.

44:42.100 --> 44:44.660
But this is a Japanese beatboxer guy.

44:44.660 --> 44:47.420
And this is the training music in We Heart Katamari.

44:47.420 --> 44:48.780
I'm only going to play a little clip of this, because

44:48.780 --> 44:49.540
it's very long.

44:49.540 --> 44:56.540
but here it is

45:19.540 --> 45:26.540
All right, you guys get the idea.

45:49.540 --> 45:52.660
I think that's funny, that's so cute.

45:52.660 --> 45:53.660
I need that.

45:53.660 --> 45:54.660
So that's the training mode.

45:54.660 --> 45:55.660
I'll send it to you later.

45:55.660 --> 45:58.580
For those of you guys, we have this poor guy in the chat room that's like,

45:58.580 --> 45:59.580
what is Katamari?

45:59.580 --> 46:02.340
What the hell is this?

46:02.340 --> 46:05.660
It was kind of a, I guess you'd call it a sleeper hit on the PlayStation 2,

46:05.660 --> 46:07.220
Katamari Damacy.

46:07.220 --> 46:10.240
Concept is, you're this little guy and you have a big ball and you roll it

46:10.240 --> 46:13.800
around and your ball is sticky and it just picks everything up.

46:13.800 --> 46:17.100
So you start out and you're rolling over like gumdrops and thumbtacks,

46:17.100 --> 46:22.800
And then suddenly you're running over small animals and like then you're running over people and cars and cities and rainbows

46:22.800 --> 46:30.080
It's beautiful beautiful game. Um, I can't really call it like an underground hit now because I think tons of people found out about this

46:30.080 --> 46:34.520
Game, it's almost mainstream now. I wanted to say though about that Japanese beatboxing

46:34.520 --> 46:39.520
It totally reminds me, that song there, of something from Bjork's latest album.

46:48.520 --> 46:53.520
This is the whole Bjork album. I don't know when I heard that, I was like, I don't know.

46:54.520 --> 46:55.520
Forget it.

46:55.520 --> 47:03.520
Just a word to our listeners. I posted in the chatroom the Japanese katamari damashi.

47:03.520 --> 47:08.520
Minagareisuki katamari damashi is up.

47:08.520 --> 47:10.520
And what does that translate to in English?

47:10.520 --> 47:13.520
Everybody loves katamari.

47:13.520 --> 47:16.520
Beautiful game, beautiful game.

47:16.520 --> 47:21.520
Alright, so we'll be looking at that. Oh, I love this. Our chatroom is going,

47:21.520 --> 47:27.680
going, um, I have a fat katamari. We should rub our katamaris together sometime. It smells

47:27.680 --> 47:37.680
like katamari in here. Is that your katamari? Maybe. Oh, chat room, you so funny. You so

47:37.680 --> 47:44.800
funny. Me laugh longer. Oh, I actually like the, it's the flashlight. It's kind of cute.

47:44.800 --> 47:50.880
Alright. Information. Oh, it's about time we start talking about that four panel dancing

47:50.880 --> 47:54.880
Alright, you want to get into the news? Fine, we'll get into the news.

47:54.880 --> 48:04.880
Alright, so, if you haven't heard yet, you might remember when we were talking about this on the show a few weeks ago, because it was huge news.

48:04.880 --> 48:14.880
And that was when Konami first filed the suit against, I keep wanting to say Anamiro, but that's not true, it's Rockzor Games, against In the Groove.

48:14.880 --> 48:18.680
and most people were saying that it has to do with the fact

48:18.680 --> 48:24.000
that what the box or the system that runs in the groove does is it kind of

48:24.000 --> 48:28.080
stows away in a regular DDR machine and Konami was saying that this was

48:28.080 --> 48:30.960
infringing on their trademarks and their patents because people would

48:30.960 --> 48:35.680
apply the in the groove stickers but they do a sloppy job of it so you would still see

48:35.680 --> 48:38.360
distinctive parts of a DDR machine underneath

48:38.360 --> 48:42.480
and it's ruining DDR because in the groove according to the lawsuit you may

48:42.480 --> 48:43.360
feel differently

48:43.360 --> 48:47.600
is a subpar game and they're saying that you know that is

48:47.600 --> 48:51.880
basically their lawsuit is that lazy arcade owners

48:51.880 --> 48:55.900
could ineffectiveness make people think that this in the group game is like DDR

48:55.900 --> 48:57.200
when in fact the games

48:57.200 --> 49:02.040
while similar in concept to those of us hardcore fans we know the two games

49:02.040 --> 49:05.720
definitely have their distinctive differences. And a lot of people said this

49:05.720 --> 49:09.320
lawsuit is about the arcade only, it's not going to affect the home version, nothing's going to

49:09.320 --> 49:09.760
happen

49:09.760 --> 49:13.240
and I remember sitting here on the show and I said boys and girls there is an

49:13.240 --> 49:17.220
important part of this lawsuit that addresses something called trade dress

49:17.220 --> 49:21.540
and that one of the little things that they were suing on was the trade dress

49:21.540 --> 49:24.340
saying that in the group not only was stowing away the machines but the game

49:24.340 --> 49:29.800
itself looked like felt like DDR but I don't know people just seem to ignore

49:29.800 --> 49:34.860
that they were saying arcane only arcane only well sure enough a an amended

49:34.860 --> 49:40.000
version of the lawsuit was filed against Roxor on July 1st and now they've

49:40.000 --> 49:45.360
included red octane as part of their lawsuit and they actually have a press

49:45.360 --> 49:48.420
release over on their site we have it linked from our site over at orange

49:48.420 --> 49:56.160
lounge radio.com basically what it's saying is that um where is it where is

49:56.160 --> 50:00.080
it oh that's the original lawsuit I'm looking at I want to look at the new one

50:00.080 --> 50:05.840
let's see here we go it says in addition to the prior counts of the original

50:05.840 --> 50:08.920
complaint in which Konami seeks an injunction and damages against rock

50:08.920 --> 50:12.380
source in the groove arcade dance simulation game the amended complaint

50:12.380 --> 50:16.420
encompasses the recently released home version of rock source in the groove

50:16.420 --> 50:20.580
game the amended complaint further includes patent infringement complaints

50:20.580 --> 50:23.860
against red octane which is the publisher of the home version of in the

50:23.860 --> 50:27.540
groove so very interesting before we get to the second part of this very

50:27.540 --> 50:33.620
interesting because you know this isn't just about the arcade mixes anymore this

50:33.620 --> 50:37.140
is about in the groove is too damn much like DDR basically is what this boils

50:37.140 --> 50:42.580
sound in my opinion. No! We haven't seen, yeah I know, no shit huh? We haven't seen

50:42.580 --> 50:49.860
the specific court documentations yet. Last time DDR Freak went into the government systems

50:49.860 --> 50:54.140
and actually pulled the original files out. They haven't done that yet for this amendment.

50:54.140 --> 50:57.980
I don't know if it doesn't exist. You can't find it. I will hunt for it later on because

50:57.980 --> 51:02.140
I think I know where to go. See if we can find it. But we don't have the exact document

51:02.140 --> 51:05.260
so we haven't been able to read in too much besides what Konami's press release is saying

51:05.260 --> 51:10.380
which of course is one-sided. But the interesting part about this, they didn't

51:10.380 --> 51:14.060
just file against Red Octane. The sentence I was reading goes on to say

51:14.060 --> 51:18.940
they have also complained against Mad Cats, which is the publisher of the game

51:18.940 --> 51:24.180
MC Groove's Dance Craze. All these additional counts are based upon the

51:24.180 --> 51:27.740
accused game's infringement of Konami's patent rights in its Dance Dance

51:27.740 --> 51:30.460
Revolution arcade game. Now what's interesting about this, those of you guys

51:30.460 --> 51:33.280
that have played the Mad Cats game or even looked at screenshots and know

51:33.280 --> 51:38.780
something about it know that yes it's a dance game but it's the sim the

51:38.780 --> 51:44.860
differences between the dance dance craze and DDR I think are a little more

51:44.860 --> 51:47.820
so than the differences between in the groove and DDR because of the fact that

51:47.820 --> 51:52.860
MC grooves dance craze basically sucks my balls I mean it's an awful game long

51:52.860 --> 51:56.340
version song steps that don't even go to the beat they switch the order of the

51:56.340 --> 51:59.340
arrows and they have that gyroscope motors I don't know what the hell it was

51:59.340 --> 52:03.780
it was a piece of crap but they're getting sued now too over this which is very

52:03.780 --> 52:10.740
interesting needless to say the crack smoking mode I guess what do you guys

52:10.740 --> 52:13.300
think about this I know you guys had very strong opinions the first time

52:13.300 --> 52:16.900
around I'm sure this just reinforces those but I'm curious I was waiting for

52:16.900 --> 52:22.420
it to happen I was really waiting for it to happen and pretty much glad glad it is

52:22.420 --> 52:27.420
so far you know that's honestly these people think that just because Konami is

52:27.420 --> 52:32.380
sitting on their ass not getting our games out means that they can do it for them, but

52:32.380 --> 52:40.380
hopefully I have a vague hope that this lights the fire under Konami to realize, hey, we

52:40.380 --> 52:42.940
need new releases.

52:42.940 --> 52:47.500
Well, they're doing a lot for the home, and I'm kind of...

52:47.500 --> 52:51.020
No, we need arcade mixes.

52:51.020 --> 52:52.380
I'm not going to disagree with you.

52:52.380 --> 52:54.460
We need new arcade mixes, definitely.

52:54.460 --> 52:58.700
Konami's focus is the home release right now and they are making a lot of money

52:58.700 --> 53:01.060
off the home releases and I think they're trying to protect that which

53:01.060 --> 53:06.480
makes sense to me. I said before and I'll say it again that I'm convinced that the

53:06.480 --> 53:10.380
reason why this whole thing happened in the first place is because In the Groove

53:10.380 --> 53:14.140
crossed that line and decided to invade the home market which is Konami's turf

53:14.140 --> 53:17.260
right now so this whole thing I think we've been working up to this the whole

53:17.260 --> 53:21.300
time. This doesn't surprise me one bit and I think even the In the Groove

53:21.300 --> 53:25.520
hardcore fan base the rabid fam is even I think at least from the reaction I'm

53:25.520 --> 53:29.960
reading on DDR freaks forums even they're starting to say you know what

53:29.960 --> 53:33.240
yeah okay it's no big surprise but the big beef that I'm hearing from the in

53:33.240 --> 53:37.140
the groove crowd tell me what you guys think about this is the fact that Konami

53:37.140 --> 53:42.440
is not releasing product anymore here's rocks or attempting to improve upon that

53:42.440 --> 53:45.520
product despite how you feel about in the groove itself they are attempt

53:45.520 --> 53:49.840
attempting to keep it going in the arcade they're trying to fill a void and

53:49.840 --> 53:52.520
make money at the same time.

53:52.520 --> 53:54.800
I mean, I really think that that's it.

53:54.800 --> 53:57.400
I think, though, I'm of the school of thought, though,

53:57.400 --> 54:01.400
that while the rock sore corporate group may be in this

54:01.400 --> 54:04.080
for the money, I think the people that started this whole

54:04.080 --> 54:06.040
thing, I mean, they were DDR fans when they started it.

54:06.040 --> 54:08.740
I think they had good intentions at heart.

54:08.740 --> 54:14.080
I think they wanted to keep the arcade's fan base alive.

54:14.080 --> 54:16.120
And they really wanted to keep this game going, because it

54:16.120 --> 54:18.280
didn't seem like Konami gave a crap anymore.

54:18.280 --> 54:21.720
So I think they had the best intentions at heart, I just think it's one of those things

54:21.720 --> 54:25.320
where it might have gotten too far ahead of itself.

54:25.320 --> 54:30.920
It's a fan thing that rolled down the hill too fast and just became bigger than it could

54:30.920 --> 54:31.920
handle.

54:31.920 --> 54:35.080
I don't know, that's my take on it all.

54:35.080 --> 54:38.560
So what do you guys think, Loki?

54:38.560 --> 54:46.300
I think the game still sucks and they're not going to make any money and Rockstar's going

54:46.300 --> 54:47.300
under.

54:47.300 --> 55:16.300
No, I haven't played this MCDanceCrate thing, but it's like, basically it comes down to this, it boils down to this. It's very similar to DDR, like, pretty much, you know, it's reskinned DDR as you want to call it. But then again, you have to also go into, like, look at the fighting games out there. I mean, Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat and stuff, they're not that different. They're pretty similar. But I guess they're different enough to where they can't sue each other over that type of stuff.

55:16.300 --> 55:43.300
So what people need to do out there now is if you want to make a music game, feel free to do so, but just make it different enough to where people aren't, you know, I mean, come on, they weren't even trying within the groove at all to make it any different from, I mean, they're adding stuff to it, whoopity-doo, and they made the arrows come not quite straight up, but you can change them so they're that way, and they sort of change the way the arrows look. That's not enough.

55:43.300 --> 56:06.300
That's like, you know, taking a Honda Civic out there, painting it a different color, and adding a spoiler to it, and calling it, you know, a, uh, a, um, Loki's Fast Car, you know, or something like that. It doesn't work. It's the same damn thing. So that's why I think about that.

56:06.300 --> 56:11.500
Angel, as someone who I think, I get the impression from you anyway, you respect both games and

56:11.500 --> 56:17.020
you, you, you, you're kinda like me, I'm, I'm, I'm not like whoop-a-dee-doo over in

56:17.020 --> 56:21.180
the groove, but for me it's filling a void that Konami isn't giving us right now with

56:21.180 --> 56:26.860
the arcade mixes and I'm, I'm content with it, um, it's, it's, it's there, I play it,

56:26.860 --> 56:31.540
it's cool, I love the USB support, but I completely understand where Konami's coming from on this,

56:31.540 --> 56:34.020
I think they're just protecting their own shit, what do you think about this?

56:34.020 --> 56:58.020
No, no, no. He hit the nail on the head there and I do, you know, I do agree with Jamie as far as, you know, I knew it was going to happen. It was just a matter of when and it's happened now. So, you know, we just got to wait to see what happens. But I do think that Redoctane is still selling it on their site as far as I know or as far as I've seen. I don't know.

56:58.020 --> 57:00.020
Yeah, you might want to, seriously, you might want to run out and get this game.

57:00.020 --> 57:02.020
Might want to run out and get it now.

57:02.020 --> 57:04.020
It could be a collector's item, but nothing else, that's for sure.

57:04.020 --> 57:21.020
Yeah, so, um, yeah, so, you know, Rob's right, just pick it up if you haven't picked it up yet, if you think it's, you know, not going to be sold anymore because of the whole, this whole thing, so, yeah.

57:21.020 --> 57:27.020
I mean, I pretty much, I have respect for both games, so I can't really say much, but I knew it was going to happen eventually.

57:27.020 --> 57:30.220
I think you're kinda the same school of thought that I am.

57:30.220 --> 57:36.020
Yeah. But who the hell wants to play that Mad Catz game anyway? Ew!

57:36.020 --> 57:40.900
I know, the Mad Catz thing is kind of a weird curveball in this whole thing. Anything with the Mad Catz name on it is a festering

57:40.900 --> 57:43.540
pile of dog poo, just like my old apartment complex.

57:43.540 --> 57:48.260
I think the Mad Catz thing throws a very interesting curveball into this whole thing

57:48.260 --> 57:49.340
because I think what every

57:49.340 --> 57:53.540
everybody is noticing is that Andamiro, not named in this whole thing, but of

57:53.540 --> 57:54.540
course you have to remember

57:54.540 --> 57:58.020
Anemiro and Konami kind of have this history of going back and forth and they

57:58.020 --> 58:02.540
settled supposedly a long time ago so this is why Anemiro is not being touched

58:02.540 --> 58:06.100
which is interesting because now people are going how does this affect In the Groove 2?

58:06.100 --> 58:10.800
honestly people I don't know and I'm not going to speculate anymore

58:10.800 --> 58:14.320
I don't know how this is going to affect In the Groove 2 and you know what you don't either

58:14.320 --> 58:19.660
nobody does we'll find out a lot of it has to do with how this is going to go

58:19.660 --> 58:24.660
So, I kind of refuse to speculate anymore on what's going to happen with In the Groove 2,

58:24.660 --> 58:28.660
because this whole thing has become such a damn mess that it's hard to say what's going to happen.

58:28.660 --> 58:33.660
Just play the game while you can and hope it's still there tomorrow. Enjoy it while it lasts.

58:33.660 --> 58:38.660
And if it lasts a long time, great. I guess that's all I can say on that.

58:38.660 --> 58:44.660
Any other thoughts? Is this going to make you low-key finally run out and get a copy of In the Groove

58:44.660 --> 58:46.660
so you can have a home mix of it?

58:46.660 --> 58:52.660
Yo, honestly, I thought about doing that today to pick up In The Groove just so I can play it and officially say I hate it.

58:52.660 --> 58:57.660
Um, and then, then, then sign on the actual, and I'm probably still gonna do this.

58:57.660 --> 59:03.660
I'm gonna get a copy of In The Groove, say I hate it after I review it, and I know I will hate it.

59:03.660 --> 59:09.660
And then I will officially sign the copy with, this game fucking sucks, and then we'll give it away on the show.

59:13.660 --> 59:14.660
Okay, if you say so.

59:14.660 --> 59:19.660
That's what we're gonna do. I'm planning on... I'll go pick one up this week, honestly.

59:19.660 --> 59:22.660
Jamie, sound like a giveaway idea to you?

59:22.660 --> 59:26.660
Why not? I'll sign on it. Um, I would...

59:26.660 --> 59:28.660
I don't know, I wouldn't want to...

59:28.660 --> 59:30.660
Don't worry, you have a week to think about what you will say.

59:30.660 --> 59:35.660
Alright, we'll all put something on there. I will put something borderline respectful, at least, on here, unlike some people.

59:35.660 --> 59:37.660
Dude, this game smells like vagina.

59:39.660 --> 59:40.660
You guys are awful.

59:40.660 --> 59:45.140
It'll be a collector's item.

59:45.140 --> 59:46.140
I know.

59:46.140 --> 59:47.140
I'll go on eBay.

59:47.140 --> 59:49.140
Are you talking about...

59:49.140 --> 59:50.140
I'll make even...

59:50.140 --> 59:55.380
I'll write comments in the manual too, you know, saying, this game is no way like DDR!

59:55.380 --> 59:56.380
What are you talking about?

59:56.380 --> 59:57.380
Anyways.

59:57.380 --> 59:58.380
Loki, Loki, Loki.

59:58.380 --> 01:00:02.580
Alright, so, either way, somebody's going to be pissed off, no matter what the result

01:00:02.580 --> 01:00:03.580
of this thing.

01:00:03.580 --> 01:00:07.420
I mean, even if In the Groove keeps going on, the DDR fans will be pissed off, and if

01:00:07.420 --> 01:00:11.060
the In The Groove production stops, the In The Groove fans will be pissed off.

01:00:11.060 --> 01:00:15.900
Do you think, though, that if Konami turns out another arcade mix, that it'll appease

01:00:15.900 --> 01:00:21.260
people and maybe they'll go, oh, OK, so Konami was working on something this whole time,

01:00:21.260 --> 01:00:22.540
now this whole lawsuit makes sense?

01:00:22.540 --> 01:00:24.460
Do you think that's going to appease people?

01:00:24.460 --> 01:00:25.860
Of course, nothing's going to appease everybody.

01:00:25.860 --> 01:00:32.500
They're going to have to, honestly, because they're going to get a lot of pretty outraged

01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:33.620
meal over this.

01:00:33.620 --> 01:00:35.860
They're going to have to do something drastic.

01:00:35.860 --> 01:00:41.540
Honestly, they want to keep your fan base. You know what, I want to bring up a tip that

01:00:41.540 --> 01:00:46.540
was brought up probably about 100 episodes ago by our one and only DarkSakura. And she

01:00:46.540 --> 01:00:52.220
says if you really want your voice to count when it comes to dealing with Konami and you

01:00:52.220 --> 01:00:56.420
want to tell them that you want to see a new arcade mix and all this stuff, buy stock in

01:00:56.420 --> 01:01:01.540
the company. Because now when you write letters you can write them as a shareholder. Exactly.

01:01:01.540 --> 01:01:05.940
And they have a legal responsibility to keep their shareholders happy.

01:01:05.940 --> 01:01:09.020
And their stock prices are pretty, uh, level right now.

01:01:09.020 --> 01:01:11.760
They're not going up or down, so.

01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:13.500
Actually it's a decent investment.

01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:16.500
You'll at least stay stationary.

01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:18.860
Alright, just something to think about.

01:01:18.860 --> 01:01:22.180
Alright kids, I think we'll go to a break and we'll come back and we'll take your calls

01:01:22.180 --> 01:01:24.300
on this issue if anybody wants to talk to us about it.

01:01:24.300 --> 01:01:26.100
Loki, and then some other news.

01:01:26.100 --> 01:01:27.100
You know what I'm pissed off about?

01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:28.100
What?

01:01:28.100 --> 01:01:29.100
The guy game.

01:01:29.100 --> 01:01:30.100
They pulled it off the market completely.

01:01:30.100 --> 01:01:31.100
Even the PC version.

01:01:31.100 --> 01:01:34.260
DVD out there with all the new cutscenes in it.

01:01:34.260 --> 01:01:36.780
That's not a surprise. I thought they pulled this thing months ago.

01:01:36.780 --> 01:01:38.860
But my copy that...

01:01:38.860 --> 01:01:41.260
my purchase copy

01:01:41.260 --> 01:01:45.660
doesn't work anymore beyond a certain stage. So I can only play the same levels over and

01:01:45.660 --> 01:01:48.940
over again.

01:01:48.940 --> 01:01:51.660
We can find it on eBay. It's supposed to be several hundred dollars.

01:01:51.660 --> 01:01:54.700
Ohhhh. Seventeen-year-old titties.

01:01:54.700 --> 01:01:56.020
Alright.

01:01:56.020 --> 01:01:59.780
In this break, to be fair, we will play some music from In the Groove 2 because we

01:01:59.780 --> 01:02:02.960
actually haven't played any of the new music from In The Groove 2, so one of our

01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:06.440
listeners, Misty, was kind enough to hook me up, so to speak. So we're gonna play

01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:10.840
three new tracks from In The Groove 2. We're gonna play Energizer, Vorsprung,

01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:15.740
Durch, Techno, and Summer, the Speedy Mix. We're gonna play these songs and check

01:02:15.740 --> 01:02:20.300
it out, and then we'll be back with your calls in regards to this recent

01:02:20.300 --> 01:02:27.300
development in the lawsuit world. We'll be back after this. More Orange Launch Radio.

01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:55.300
I will not let you go.

01:02:55.300 --> 01:03:00.300
I will not let you go.

01:07:30.300 --> 01:07:35.300
Hey! Hey!

01:07:35.300 --> 01:07:36.300

Hey, how do you like that? A little plug there for our podcast. Hope you guys are checking that out over at Orangelaunchradio.com.

01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:19.800
Now you can get it in iTunes as well. It's super.

01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:22.800
We are becoming Apple-ized.

01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:27.800
Yeah, you know, and I'm thinking about buying an Apple laptop too. I'm slowly converting to the Mac way.

01:10:27.800 --> 01:10:29.800
Don't you even open your damn mouth, Loki.

01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:40.800
That's okay. My next computer, I'm actually going to be building a new PC, but the next one I actually buy pieced is going to be one of the Mac Mini G5s.

01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:52.800
Don't worry, I'm not knocking your, you know, perspective purchase of a Mac product. In fact, I was actually thinking of doing my own infomercial for, you know, Macintosh and Apple products.

01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:53.800
Uh-huh.

01:10:53.800 --> 01:10:55.480
it goes a little something like this

01:10:55.480 --> 01:11:01.640
do you like stuff that's pretty but does absolutely nothing that apple is for you

01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:06.120
because my computer purchases are based on color and not performance

01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:08.020
i like stuff that's smooth and shiny

01:11:08.020 --> 01:11:10.080
okay and then they could sell microsoft windows

01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:13.760
hey kids do you like spyware

01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:15.360
no i'm sorry that's internet explorer

01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:17.360
you know what

01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:19.600
what

01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:21.520
if you work in graphics

01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:25.760
video editing, anything that has to do with audio-visual, a Mac is for you.

01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:28.480
That was a long time ago, not anymore.

01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:29.480
I beg to differ.

01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:30.480
I beg to differ as well.

01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:36.280
After having done my Photoshop homework on a top-line PC and then gone back and doing

01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:40.400
all my touch-ups on a G5, oh yeah, world of difference.

01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:45.720
To answer a question in chat room, a 15-inch PowerBook.

01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:47.120
That's why I nicknamed my penis.

01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:49.960
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

01:11:49.960 --> 01:11:55.960
I didn't hear that. Okay, I did. Never mind.

01:11:55.960 --> 01:12:01.960
Let's go back to the previous topic we were talking here.

01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:05.960
We actually had a question from our chatroom during the break here about this whole lawsuit issue.

01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:10.960
Darkknight wanted to know, hey Sky, just a thought. With this revised lawsuit, what about Guitar Hero?

01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:15.960
Since Red Octane is publishing that game, do you think Konami will go after that as well?

01:12:15.960 --> 01:12:21.160
No. No. If Red Octane is still in business after this, which I think they will be, I

01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:25.840
don't think this is going to set them back too far, I don't think this is going to affect

01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:34.840
Guitar Hero at all. Had Red Octane stayed as a third party peripheral, I don't think

01:12:34.840 --> 01:12:40.720
Konami would have had a problem with them at all. They stepped on the toes. That's another

01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:44.800
very interesting thing about this whole lawsuit. Konami really hasn't been putting out their

01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:48.560
own pads I mean sure there's bundle packs but let's face it most of us are

01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:51.840
getting our pads from either red octane mad cats or one of those other countless

01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:56.200
DDR pad companies but mad cats and red octane admittedly being the two biggest

01:12:56.200 --> 01:13:01.120
Konami suing both of them now are they gonna say well F you Konami we're not

01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:05.480
gonna make these pads anymore see they've gone from being like protective

01:13:05.480 --> 01:13:10.180
footwear to being platform shoes that step on the toes of Konami honestly

01:13:10.180 --> 01:13:15.400
though come on now red octane oh I did not know that in the groove was anything

01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:19.740
like DDR no come on they knew what they're getting into when they you know

01:13:19.740 --> 01:13:23.340
decided to go ahead and publish these games I mean it's retarded to say

01:13:23.340 --> 01:13:26.780
otherwise and honestly they're not gonna sue them over guitar hero because a

01:13:26.780 --> 01:13:30.740
guitar hero is different enough from guitar freaks to be you know its own

01:13:30.740 --> 01:13:35.220
game it's more like amplitude yeah exactly since harmonix is developing it

01:13:35.220 --> 01:13:39.740
it's all coach yeah exactly so I'm all for that because it actually looks good

01:13:39.740 --> 01:13:43.600
They're doing stuff to improve the game. It doesn't you know try to you know copy something else

01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:50.540
So and of course our two of them our chat room now. I have a fat lawsuit. Let's rub our lawsuits together some time

01:13:52.080 --> 01:13:55.900
Lawsuit it sounds like fresh lawsuit in here. Is that your lawsuit?

01:13:59.780 --> 01:14:03.180
Skypline is open boys and girls if you would like to talk to us live

01:14:03.180 --> 01:14:04.700
Pick up the phone!

01:14:04.700 --> 01:14:08.980
Head on over to our chat room, www.orangeloungeradio.com,

01:14:08.980 --> 01:14:10.380
and click on interact with us.

01:14:10.380 --> 01:14:12.880
And that laughter there means we've already picked up a call.

01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:14.460
So hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:14:14.460 --> 01:14:15.620
Who dis?

01:14:15.620 --> 01:14:16.340
It's Ron-Chan.

01:14:16.340 --> 01:14:17.340
Who you think it is?

01:14:17.340 --> 01:14:18.060
Hello, Ron-Chan.

01:14:18.060 --> 01:14:19.760
We'll see I can tell by the icon,

01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:22.140
but the radio bit that we do is we

01:14:22.140 --> 01:14:24.260
play stupid so that you introduce yourself

01:14:24.260 --> 01:14:25.340
to our listeners.

01:14:25.340 --> 01:14:26.820
That's how it works.

01:14:26.820 --> 01:14:27.320
All right.

01:14:27.320 --> 01:14:28.780
Hello.

01:14:28.780 --> 01:14:29.660
Hey, Oak-Chan.

01:14:29.660 --> 01:14:32.340
Ron-Chan.

01:14:32.340 --> 01:14:34.940
What is up, dude?

01:14:34.940 --> 01:14:36.260
What is up with Konami?

01:14:36.260 --> 01:14:39.580
I swear, it's like they're trying to violate their fanbase or something

01:14:39.580 --> 01:14:40.340
like that.

01:14:40.340 --> 01:14:41.980
That's how I honestly feel.

01:14:41.980 --> 01:14:44.540
You're a little bit choppy, but I'm going to interpret for those

01:14:44.540 --> 01:14:45.900
that might have missed it there.

01:14:45.900 --> 01:14:50.100
Basically, Rama's saying that they're violating their fanbase

01:14:50.100 --> 01:14:51.580
with this whole thing.

01:14:51.580 --> 01:14:55.460
I agree to an extent that they're pissing a lot of people off with this,

01:14:55.460 --> 01:14:58.700
but at the same time, don't they have a right to protect what's theirs?

01:14:58.700 --> 01:14:59.700
Yes, they do.

01:14:59.700 --> 01:15:03.860
And it's sort of like, they want to be the granddaddy of the dancing games.

01:15:03.860 --> 01:15:08.500
Now, here comes a bunch of new guys come along with something, and they're like, oh no, you

01:15:08.500 --> 01:15:09.500
can't have that.

01:15:09.500 --> 01:15:10.500
You must play our game only.

01:15:10.500 --> 01:15:11.500
Not theirs.

01:15:11.500 --> 01:15:16.300
Well, but considering they did invent DDR, I mean, you could go back and say, well, there

01:15:16.300 --> 01:15:22.460
was dance aerobics, but I, you know, BS, DDR is its own thing.

01:15:22.460 --> 01:15:25.660
I think they're just kind of protecting what's theirs, and I think what kind of ticks people

01:15:25.660 --> 01:15:28.640
off is that this is where people get pissed off.

01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:33.840
In The Groove probably, I may get yelled at for saying this, but In The Groove probably

01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:39.120
wouldn't exist if Konami had continued to put out arcade releases.

01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:40.120
Agreed or disagree?

01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:41.120
You are correct.

01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:42.120
I agree with you.

01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:43.120
Yeah.

01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:48.560
So, in a sense, I think where people get pissed off is that they feel like Konami abandoned

01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:49.560
us.

01:15:49.560 --> 01:15:53.240
Even though they've been doing home mixes, let's face it, the reason why the fan base

01:15:53.240 --> 01:15:58.940
is so large is because we had arcade tournaments and arcade freestyle competitions, all these

01:15:58.940 --> 01:16:00.440
things going on in the arcade.

01:16:00.440 --> 01:16:02.540
We were not doing this stuff in our houses.

01:16:02.540 --> 01:16:06.120
We're doing it now because we don't have any other choice, but this whole thing started

01:16:06.120 --> 01:16:07.760
because of the arcades.

01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:14.400
And the home versions, as good as they've been, are not the same thing.

01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:17.020
Remember when we all used to go to Roseville Golf Land on Wednesday nights, back when Roseville

01:16:17.020 --> 01:16:20.500
Golf Land was cool, and we used to play DDR, we had a good old time.

01:16:20.500 --> 01:16:25.460
You can't get that same feeling with a home mix, and there's people all across the nation

01:16:25.460 --> 01:16:29.040
like we are that did that, and we're all excited when Max 2 came out, because you had the new

01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:32.780
songs unlocked, and Konami, in a sense, abandoned this.

01:16:32.780 --> 01:16:37.340
But okay, now to even further contradict myself, or whatever you want to say, at the same time,

01:16:37.340 --> 01:16:40.820
we were never supposed to have those games in the first place, ideally, because they

01:16:40.820 --> 01:16:41.820
were Japanese mixes.

01:16:41.820 --> 01:16:43.760
We weren't supposed to have them in the first place.

01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:47.940
But I think Konami was turning a blind eye to the whole thing because it sold home mixes

01:16:47.940 --> 01:16:48.940
for them.

01:16:48.940 --> 01:16:51.180
That's how it all boils down, in my opinion.

01:16:51.180 --> 01:16:54.500
Yeah, and they were making money off the import games being sold over here, too.

01:16:54.500 --> 01:16:55.980
That's all it was.

01:16:55.980 --> 01:16:56.820
Yeah.

01:16:56.820 --> 01:16:57.620
Yeah.

01:16:57.620 --> 01:17:00.980
Although, but then let's look at the reality of this, though.

01:17:00.980 --> 01:17:03.560
Let's look at where DDR is at now.

01:17:03.560 --> 01:17:05.820
Where is DDR making all the money now?

01:17:05.820 --> 01:17:08.140
DDR is making all its money on the home mixes, right?

01:17:08.140 --> 01:17:10.900
Konami sends out this press release in January saying, hey,

01:17:10.900 --> 01:17:11.940
look how big our dick is.

01:17:11.940 --> 01:17:15.140
We sold a million copies of the home versions of DDR today.

01:17:15.140 --> 01:17:17.180
We are so freaking rad.

01:17:17.180 --> 01:17:23.580
So Konami's bread and butter right now is the home mixes of DDR.

01:17:23.580 --> 01:17:28.060
So now here comes this game that's infringing on the home mixes, which we'll refer to as

01:17:28.060 --> 01:17:33.520
I can't believe it's not butter, and now Konami's ticked off.

01:17:33.520 --> 01:17:36.820
I think that's just kind of where this all boils down from.

01:17:36.820 --> 01:17:43.140
But the percentage of people who are arcade rabid fandom-ness is actually, even though

01:17:43.140 --> 01:17:49.220
consider the DDR Freak has 50,000 members. ITG Freak, not as many. Like it or not,

01:17:49.220 --> 01:17:53.300
well I don't know how many members of ITG Freak there are offhand, but let me

01:17:53.300 --> 01:17:57.420
just say, let's say 10,000. I know I think I might be overdoing it for him a little

01:17:57.420 --> 01:18:03.340
bit. Let's say ITG Freak has 10,000. 10,000 out of a million is still 1%.

01:18:03.340 --> 01:18:08.700
Konami can piss off 1% of its fan base and cut their losses, because Extreme 2

01:18:08.700 --> 01:18:15.700
UltraMix II and UltraMix III stand to be so big that I think things are only going to get better for them.

01:18:15.700 --> 01:18:18.700
I don't know. That's just kind of my perspective on it.

01:18:18.700 --> 01:18:23.700
Yeah, and I completely agree with your perspective. See, personally, I'm not an ICG freak. I'm not a fanboy.

01:18:23.700 --> 01:18:30.700
I like both games. I have the mixes on both sides, and I enjoy playing them, you know?

01:18:30.700 --> 01:18:35.700
Overall, if it wasn't for the fact that the fans were screaming for more DDR,

01:18:35.700 --> 01:18:39.620
and the group wouldn't even be here right now. I just feel that

01:18:39.620 --> 01:18:43.060
you're right, Konami did ignore the fans for a while

01:18:43.060 --> 01:18:46.940
some guys came along to do something, it just gave them a reason to

01:18:46.940 --> 01:18:50.100
basically they just woke the sleeping bear

01:18:50.100 --> 01:18:55.900
by the way I way overshot it just under 2,000 members on itgfreak.com right now

01:18:55.900 --> 01:18:59.280
hell no. Well shit. So I mean look at that

01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:02.380
I mean one-fifth of a percent

01:19:02.380 --> 01:19:30.380
So Konami can cut their losses by pissing off, assuming every single one of those people are pissed off, which they're not, I'm a member of itgfreak.com, I'm not pissed off, but I respect In The Groove, I respect what In The Groove was built on, it was guys like us who happen to have a little programming knowledge, who wanted, I mean, let's face it, we all have, oh god, now I'm like going off on this, we've all expressed our love for these dance games, if you want to call it that, in different ways.

01:19:30.380 --> 01:19:34.680
ways. Myself, Loki Dark Soccer, we have a radio program, right? It's a damn good thing

01:19:34.680 --> 01:19:42.000
that my DDREX2 never took off. These guys used what they had to build an arcade mix,

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:46.060
and that was how they were going to continue on with it. So I respect where In the Groove

01:19:46.060 --> 01:19:50.960
came from, and they wanted to improve on the things they thought needed improving, and

01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:54.280
despite the way some of us feel about the game, to these guys it's an improvement on

01:19:54.280 --> 01:19:59.880
the game the problem is is it just I think got carried away and money will do

01:19:59.880 --> 01:20:04.640
amazing things to people and I think there was a little bit and I I apologize

01:20:04.640 --> 01:20:07.360
to anybody that might be on the ITG team that might be offended by this comment

01:20:07.360 --> 01:20:10.160
but I think there was a little bit of cockiness on their end that they were

01:20:10.160 --> 01:20:13.920
gonna get away with this for forever because and I say that because on the

01:20:13.920 --> 01:20:18.760
message boards for the longest time people would say how is this legal and

01:20:18.760 --> 01:20:22.000
And the response would be, shut up, it is.

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:23.880
And now Konami's calling their bluff.

01:20:23.880 --> 01:20:25.360
All right.

01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:29.240
Now here's my next question, something I said, somebody has mentioned in the chat room earlier.

01:20:29.240 --> 01:20:33.600
Now that Konami's going after Red Octane and Mad Catz, do you think they'll also go after

01:20:33.600 --> 01:20:38.800
the creators of Step Mania, even though it's something free to give away?

01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:47.440
Technically, they kind of already are, if you want to go in the school of thought that

01:20:47.440 --> 01:20:53.320
in the Groove is based off of StepMania, but as for the StepMania PC itself, I don't think

01:20:53.320 --> 01:20:57.100
they're going to. I think because of the fact that StepMania is open source and they're

01:20:57.100 --> 01:21:00.920
not making a dime off it, I think it makes it a little harder to get, if you know what

01:21:00.920 --> 01:21:07.040
I mean. And I think, again, StepMania is so underground, they're not putting StepMania

01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:13.640
in stores. So I think for that reason, StepMania has been able to stay under the radar, even

01:21:13.640 --> 01:21:17.140
Even though most of the Rabid fanbase knows about it, StepMania in many senses is still

01:21:17.140 --> 01:21:21.580
a little bit under the radar when it comes into the whole big corporate scheme of things.

01:21:21.580 --> 01:21:26.820
So I think they've been able to dodge the bullet for a while now and I don't see them

01:21:26.820 --> 01:21:30.860
suddenly becoming a target, but the minute they try to make money off of it, I think

01:21:30.860 --> 01:21:33.140
it will be a target.

01:21:33.140 --> 01:21:34.140
And you're right, Loki.

01:21:34.140 --> 01:21:36.460
It's probably for the best that your machine never did take off because you'd be in the

01:21:36.460 --> 01:21:37.460
same boat right now.

01:21:37.460 --> 01:21:39.540
Actually, no, it wouldn't matter because it's one arcade.

01:21:39.540 --> 01:21:40.540
It'd be their fault.

01:21:40.540 --> 01:21:46.220
if it took off and etcetera. So, I'm not that dumb.

01:21:46.220 --> 01:21:50.620
So any other thoughts for us, Rama? Well, I'll tell you this, the way this lawsuit

01:21:50.620 --> 01:21:54.740
is going, if Konami says cease and desist on ITG, those copies are going to be worth

01:21:54.740 --> 01:21:59.660
a lot of money in the next few weeks. It's going to be the new Tengan Tetris is

01:21:59.660 --> 01:22:02.500
what it is. Exactly what I was thinking.

01:22:02.500 --> 01:22:06.420
All right. Well, have a good one, Rama. Thanks for giving us a call and giving us your opinion.

01:22:06.420 --> 01:22:08.500
We appreciate it, okay? From?

01:22:08.500 --> 01:22:09.500
Later!

01:22:09.500 --> 01:22:10.500
Later!

01:22:10.500 --> 01:22:14.600
Speaking of Rama, I think he's one of our East Coast listeners, in fact I know he is,

01:22:14.600 --> 01:22:16.980
one of our East Coast listeners, and that reminds me, I was going to mention this, by

01:22:16.980 --> 01:22:21.580
the way, our Skype line is open, orangelaunchradio.com, click on interact with us, and you too can

01:22:21.580 --> 01:22:24.220
give us a call on the Skype line.

01:22:24.220 --> 01:22:27.580
That reminds me, I'm actually going to be out there for a DDR tournament, and get this,

01:22:27.580 --> 01:22:30.580
I haven't been to, it's actually a DDR slash in the group tournament, and get this, I haven't

01:22:30.580 --> 01:22:34.000
been to like a DDR tournament since March Madness, like last year, so it's been a long

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:37.320
time, but I figured since I'm going to be on the East Coast anyway for work-related

01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:41.240
things my day job I might as well go ahead and say hello to the folks at the

01:22:41.240 --> 01:22:45.480
tournament on the East Coast so assuming that this tournament actually happens

01:22:45.480 --> 01:22:48.200
because there hasn't been a whole lot of activity on the forums but I'm planning

01:22:48.200 --> 01:22:55.200
on it it's taken place over at 8 on the break and it's happening on August 7th

01:22:55.200 --> 01:23:02.800
and it's called what is the cotc3 champions of the coast is what it's

01:23:02.800 --> 01:23:06.080
called that's happening at 8 on the break on August 7th I will be there

01:23:06.080 --> 01:23:09.680
signing autographs and taking pictures. No, I'm kidding. You guys don't care, but I do

01:23:09.680 --> 01:23:12.840
want to meet some of our East Coast listeners, so if you're in the area, stop

01:23:12.840 --> 01:23:19.040
on by and say hello. I have an idea for a game. It's called Hyper Italian Siblings.

01:23:19.040 --> 01:23:25.760
It's basically gonna be a platform game, you know, starring two, you know, funny, you

01:23:25.760 --> 01:23:32.040
know, air conditioning repairmen, and they're gonna be saving some chick in

01:23:32.040 --> 01:23:37.260
in the fungus land. Do you think I'm going to get sued by Nintendo for copying Mario

01:23:37.260 --> 01:23:41.620
Brothers? Because it's a completely original idea. I'm just changing the sprites and everything

01:23:41.620 --> 01:23:45.020
so it looks nothing like Mario, but sort of is Mario.

01:23:45.020 --> 01:23:48.500
Loki, it's funny you bring that up. Have you ever heard of a game on the Commodore 64 called

01:23:48.500 --> 01:23:56.340
The Great Giana Sisters? Yeah. It was basically that. Except they replaced a Mario and Luigi

01:23:56.340 --> 01:24:01.420
with little spiky haired females and needless to say Nintendo filed against them. And when

01:24:01.420 --> 01:24:06.820
people compare, people always are comparing In the Groove and DDR saying

01:24:06.820 --> 01:24:11.780
it's Street Fighter versus Mortal Kombat, right? Mortal Kombat and Street

01:24:11.780 --> 01:24:16.060
Fighter are both fighting games and In the Groove and DDR are both dancing games

01:24:16.060 --> 01:24:21.620
and to me when I look at these games I go no it's a little more like Mario and

01:24:21.620 --> 01:24:25.500
Great Giana Sisters, you know? Great Giana Sisters has some things that Mario

01:24:25.500 --> 01:24:28.540
didn't. Great Giana Sisters has better background music than Mario Brothers, I

01:24:28.540 --> 01:24:32.260
would go that far to say that. It may not be as memorable to a lot of people, but Great

01:24:32.260 --> 01:24:36.900
Gianna Sisters has some fantastic background music in it, and just a slightly different

01:24:36.900 --> 01:24:41.680
gameplay. So the games were slightly different, but not enough. I mean, it was, when you played

01:24:41.680 --> 01:24:44.700
it, you were still like, wow, this is frickin' Mario Brothers.

01:24:44.700 --> 01:24:50.540
You know what I was watching today? I was watching on, was it Nickelodeon Gas, their

01:24:50.540 --> 01:24:56.620
games and sports network or whatever? They had reruns of Finders Keepers, and one of

01:24:56.620 --> 01:25:02.140
the grand prizes on there was a Nintendo Entertainment System with the power pad.

01:25:02.140 --> 01:25:03.140
That is awesome.

01:25:03.140 --> 01:25:05.660
I was like, oh my god, that's sweet.

01:25:05.660 --> 01:25:09.980
Alright, not a lot of calls left on the Skype line, so I'm getting the sense that you people

01:25:09.980 --> 01:25:13.860
are sick of talking about this, which is fine, but you know what?

01:25:13.860 --> 01:25:18.540
It's going to affect the future of this whole dance game scene, so just, you know, keep

01:25:18.540 --> 01:25:19.540
your eye on this.

01:25:19.540 --> 01:25:20.540
Loki.

01:25:20.540 --> 01:25:23.220
I was going to say, it's time to talk about Paris Hilton and-

01:25:23.220 --> 01:25:24.220
No, no, no.

01:25:24.220 --> 01:25:25.220
We'll open the Skype line.

01:25:25.220 --> 01:25:28.460
the skype line up for any new celebrity instead of Paris Hilton.

01:25:28.460 --> 01:25:31.620
Lindsay Lohan! Lindsay Lohan, I agree.

01:25:31.620 --> 01:25:36.460
No, no. That's the point! We're not going to talk about anybody respecting that.

01:25:36.460 --> 01:25:40.460
How about Ben Affleck and Jennifer whatever? They can still call him Ben Affleck.

01:25:40.460 --> 01:25:42.580
Are they back together? They can still call him Ben-ifer.

01:25:42.580 --> 01:25:46.500
Wait, wait, wait, are they back together? The new Jennifer.

01:25:46.500 --> 01:25:52.500
Oh. Not J-Lo. No, J-ho or something.

01:25:52.500 --> 01:25:56.500
Alright. Actually, we are getting another call, so I'll go ahead and go to the Skyblind and take this.

01:25:56.500 --> 01:25:59.500
Hello, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:25:59.500 --> 01:26:01.500
Hey, what's up? This is DeepThought42.

01:26:01.500 --> 01:26:04.500
Hello, Deep... Did you say DeepThroat42?

01:26:04.500 --> 01:26:05.500
DeepThought42.

01:26:05.500 --> 01:26:08.500
That's just teasing. DeepThought42, how you doing?

01:26:08.500 --> 01:26:09.500
Am I echoing this week?

01:26:09.500 --> 01:26:13.500
No, you sound really good this week, so whatever you did fixed up, so good job.

01:26:13.500 --> 01:26:15.500
I plugged in my headphones.

01:26:15.500 --> 01:26:16.500
Ah.

01:26:16.500 --> 01:26:18.500
Wonderful, wonderful bit of technology that that is.

01:26:18.500 --> 01:26:20.500
There you go. That's what I had to do here.

01:26:20.500 --> 01:26:21.500
What's on your mind?

01:26:21.500 --> 01:26:46.500
Not much. I sent Jamie an email earlier this week because I was on GameSpot.com and I read an article which is yet another travesty in the world of GTA that politicians are ranting on about GTA, the sex mod, the hot coffee mod that's going around.

01:26:46.500 --> 01:26:47.500
Oh, I heard about this.

01:26:47.500 --> 01:26:50.500
Yeah, I had the article set aside to actually discuss during the podcast tonight.

01:26:50.500 --> 01:26:54.500
We can touch on it. We'll get into it in more detail in the podcast.

01:26:54.500 --> 01:26:58.500
Does this have to do with... I was reading something about the ESRB.

01:26:58.500 --> 01:27:02.500
They're saying that it's violating the integrity of the ESRB.

01:27:02.500 --> 01:27:06.500
The thing is that the company removed the...

01:27:06.500 --> 01:27:10.500
You know, it's like when you get a demo out...

01:27:10.500 --> 01:27:14.500
My demo of Umjamalami, for example, has every single stage in it

01:27:14.500 --> 01:27:18.500
and just blocks it. Reprogram part of the code.

01:27:18.500 --> 01:27:24.500
That's exactly what they did with GTA, but there are people out there...

01:27:24.500 --> 01:27:28.500
They would have had to recode the entire game. It would have pushed it back months.

01:27:28.500 --> 01:27:33.500
If they had actually removed it from the game. It's in the PS2 version.

01:27:33.500 --> 01:27:34.500
Yeah.

01:27:34.500 --> 01:27:41.500
But instead of pushing it back five months to recode the entire game, they blocked it.

01:27:41.500 --> 01:27:44.500
It's not their fault that someone found a way around it.

01:27:44.500 --> 01:27:51.740
For example, Bloody War 3. You remember they had the, uh, the, uh, special photographs

01:27:51.740 --> 01:27:55.420
hidden in the game. Accessible through the D.F.E.S. menu.

01:27:55.420 --> 01:27:57.180
Okay, okay. That was awesome.

01:27:57.180 --> 01:28:02.580
You know what, I, I, I think, what about, what about, what about the Sims? I mean, you've

01:28:02.580 --> 01:28:06.060
got the nude patch for the Sims. I mean, that's the same thing.

01:28:06.060 --> 01:28:09.200
Exactly. Well, but the nude patch was a patch. It didn't

01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:12.620
unlock something that was already there. Same with the hot coffee mod. It's a patch.

01:28:12.620 --> 01:28:17.700
I know, I know. You know what? I totally side, and I can't believe I'm siding with Rockstar

01:28:17.700 --> 01:28:22.060
on something, but I completely side with them on this because if they locked it away and

01:28:22.060 --> 01:28:26.940
somebody went somewhere they shouldn't have, that's not Rockstar's problem. And I think

01:28:26.940 --> 01:28:31.940
the ESRB's issue with this is they're going to look and see if, were they hiding this?

01:28:31.940 --> 01:28:34.820
Were they intentionally hiding this from us when they screwed it?

01:28:34.820 --> 01:28:35.820
Yeah, that's the issue.

01:28:35.820 --> 01:28:36.820
And I'm going to say no.

01:28:36.820 --> 01:28:37.820
That's the issue that they're looking into.

01:28:37.820 --> 01:28:38.820
No, they're not that stupid.

01:28:38.820 --> 01:28:42.260
Because it's only, it's only in the PC version. You can't unlock it in the Xbox.

01:28:42.260 --> 01:28:45.260
No, you can unlock it in the PS2 version. Can you?

01:28:45.260 --> 01:28:46.260
It's in the PS2 version.

01:28:46.260 --> 01:28:47.260
Yeah, you can unlock it.

01:28:47.260 --> 01:28:50.260
It's incredibly difficult to do, but you can do it.

01:28:50.260 --> 01:28:52.260
Oh, but is it like a button code you put in?

01:28:52.260 --> 01:28:53.260
No.

01:28:53.260 --> 01:28:55.260
No, no, no. You have to download something to your memory stick.

01:28:55.260 --> 01:28:56.260
Okay.

01:28:56.260 --> 01:28:57.260
I know, I haven't done it.

01:28:57.260 --> 01:28:58.260
That's hacking.

01:28:58.260 --> 01:28:59.260
I'm not so interested.

01:28:59.260 --> 01:29:00.260
That's, yeah, I know exactly.

01:29:00.260 --> 01:29:04.260
The Blanks people will go to see some titties in their games, please.

01:29:04.260 --> 01:29:08.260
Go play some Custer's Revenge, people.

01:29:08.260 --> 01:29:14.100
people. You know what? Right there you're talking about hacking though. You're going

01:29:14.100 --> 01:29:17.580
on the internet and you're talking about really, you're talking about violating the license

01:29:17.580 --> 01:29:21.940
agreement when you open the box and buy the game. The part of the license agreement says

01:29:21.940 --> 01:29:26.220
you will not fuck with the game. And you're violating the license agreement. So I think

01:29:26.220 --> 01:29:29.660
Rockstar's base is covered and I think through this whole investigation. But of course...

01:29:29.660 --> 01:29:34.860
And Rockstar has gone through so much shit in the past couple years by fucking parents

01:29:34.860 --> 01:29:43.680
ruining this country, that they're not that stupid, you know, they wouldn't do something

01:29:43.680 --> 01:29:44.680
like that intentionally.

01:29:44.680 --> 01:29:48.480
They saw the minigame and they were like, you know what, this is crossing a line that

01:29:48.480 --> 01:29:50.160
we don't even want to cross.

01:29:50.160 --> 01:29:54.420
I agree, I have to side with Rockstar on this one, I think after the investigation it will

01:29:54.420 --> 01:29:59.120
be found out this way, and the angry parents, the parents who are angry over this, lesson

01:29:59.120 --> 01:30:02.640
learned, watch what your fucking kids download on the internet, because that's where they're

01:30:02.640 --> 01:30:03.640
getting this whole thing in the first place.

01:30:03.640 --> 01:30:14.640
I have to say, I told Jamie this, but I do, in essence, agree. If you read the article, it's all basically this one guy, his name is Leland Lee. He's a California assemblyman.

01:30:14.640 --> 01:30:16.640
Those California bastards.

01:30:16.640 --> 01:30:20.640
Yeah, I know. A Democrat from San Francisco. Damn it.

01:30:20.640 --> 01:30:33.640
He has a law in there saying that they do need to overhaul the ESRB. I do agree with that. I do think there needs to be a PG-13 rating.

01:30:33.640 --> 01:30:35.640
I agree with that too.

01:30:35.640 --> 01:30:41.720
And I do, because you go from Teen, which is like Final Fantasy X, to Grand Theft Auto

01:30:41.720 --> 01:30:46.260
San Andreas, you know, that's not, you know, there needs to be a PG-13, and there needs

01:30:46.260 --> 01:30:51.720
to be, if you sell an M-rated game to someone under 16, it should be like selling cigarettes

01:30:51.720 --> 01:30:52.720
to a minor.

01:30:52.720 --> 01:30:54.920
It should be the exact same thing.

01:30:54.920 --> 01:30:55.920
To an extent I agree with that.

01:30:55.920 --> 01:31:00.040
I think the rules for games should mirror the rules of movies right on down to the rating

01:31:00.040 --> 01:31:01.040
system.

01:31:01.040 --> 01:31:02.040
Exactly.

01:31:02.040 --> 01:31:05.520
as much as an issue as I have with the ratings board sometimes because they'll

01:31:05.520 --> 01:31:08.660
they'll give a movie like War of the Worlds which showed like you know

01:31:08.660 --> 01:31:15.080
flying body parts and everything and that movie gets a PG-13

01:31:15.080 --> 01:31:16.720
I like flying body parts

01:31:16.720 --> 01:31:20.120
I know but it still it should be R-rated but you're an adult and you can enjoy

01:31:20.120 --> 01:31:21.720
flying body parts whenever you want

01:31:21.720 --> 01:31:23.760
I didn't have a problem with flying body parts

01:31:23.760 --> 01:31:26.680
I liked flying body parts when I was in high school

01:31:26.680 --> 01:31:30.000
But here's the thing, then you take a movie like Romeo and Michelle's High School Reunion

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:33.480
because they drop the F bomb three times in that movie

01:31:33.480 --> 01:31:36.960
it gets an R rating. There is an inconsistency here.

01:31:36.960 --> 01:31:41.320
But that problem I have with the MPAA aside

01:31:41.320 --> 01:31:46.360
I think the MPAA and the ESRB should work together to be using the same rating

01:31:46.360 --> 01:31:47.440
system because

01:31:47.440 --> 01:31:50.600
parents already identify with that PG-13

01:31:50.600 --> 01:31:54.520
PGR. It's already emblazed in their brains

01:31:54.520 --> 01:31:58.640
and so I think they should be just copying that.

01:31:58.640 --> 01:32:03.000
singling out video games. Why are they not going to, you know,

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:07.080
why are they not raging against Rob Zombie's new movie?

01:32:07.080 --> 01:32:10.840
You know, why is it all about video games? And to me, I think it's

01:32:10.840 --> 01:32:15.800
it's the government is trying to, I mean, not to get all politic, you know,

01:32:15.800 --> 01:32:18.840
conspiracy theory on you, but I think it's just

01:32:18.840 --> 01:32:22.760
them trying to say, what is art and what is not?

01:32:22.760 --> 01:32:27.520
And they're trying to say that if it's not art, then they can ban it.

01:32:27.520 --> 01:32:31.200
Am I totally out of... No, I'm with you.

01:32:31.200 --> 01:32:35.300
I'm with you to a point here. I'm with you.

01:32:35.300 --> 01:32:40.280
I don't know. That's just my... I mean, that may be a little too conspiracy theory, but I mean

01:32:40.280 --> 01:32:42.320
between that and the flag burning amendment

01:32:42.320 --> 01:32:45.240
and the fact that our president is going to be electing...

01:32:45.240 --> 01:32:49.480
is going to be appointing not only a Supreme Court Justice but a Chief Justice,

01:32:49.480 --> 01:32:52.880
all that stuff scares me right now.

01:32:52.880 --> 01:32:58.960
As someone who didn't vote for our president, I can say it kind of scares me too, but we

01:32:58.960 --> 01:32:59.960
just have to...

01:32:59.960 --> 01:33:00.960
We need to march on Washington from this shit.

01:33:00.960 --> 01:33:06.760
We need to go to fucking Lafayette Park with a can of Cassine.

01:33:06.760 --> 01:33:07.760
Are you talking about...

01:33:07.760 --> 01:33:10.280
A bunch of flags and just be like, fuck you.

01:33:10.280 --> 01:33:12.240
Are you talking about a million gamer march?

01:33:12.240 --> 01:33:13.960
Is this what you're bringing up here?

01:33:13.960 --> 01:33:14.960
Yes.

01:33:14.960 --> 01:33:15.960
A million gamer march.

01:33:15.960 --> 01:33:16.960
That's what we call it.

01:33:16.960 --> 01:33:18.200
Go to the floor of E3.

01:33:18.200 --> 01:33:21.320
That's what it feels like sometimes, is a million gamer march.

01:33:21.320 --> 01:33:23.760
No, I I can't you know what I I

01:33:24.680 --> 01:33:26.720
Think someone has to do something

01:33:26.720 --> 01:33:30.580
I I think parents of the world could stand to be educated on this issue a little bit more

01:33:30.580 --> 01:33:37.160
But I think to as an extent I think the game should be mirroring the movies a little bit because society for whatever reason

01:33:37.200 --> 01:33:40.280
We have this movie thing in blazing our head, but for video games

01:33:40.280 --> 01:33:43.640
We treat it differently and for some parents video games are the babysitter

01:33:44.540 --> 01:33:49.780
Yeah, and it's just different. I don't know some parents television is babysitter. Do you have you ever watched like CSI?

01:33:49.780 --> 01:33:54.220
Have you ever watched like, I mean just because they don't swear doesn't mean it's not graphic.

01:33:54.220 --> 01:33:55.220
I mean that's disturbing.

01:33:55.220 --> 01:33:56.220
Me personally, no.

01:33:56.220 --> 01:34:00.020
I haven't watched CSI, but I have watched other shows that are just as bad.

01:34:00.020 --> 01:34:01.020
Yeah.

01:34:01.020 --> 01:34:04.260
In fact, I was watching a show the other day that they said shit on it, and I was like,

01:34:04.260 --> 01:34:05.260
wow.

01:34:05.260 --> 01:34:06.260
I mean I didn't care.

01:34:06.260 --> 01:34:07.260
I thought it was funny.

01:34:07.260 --> 01:34:08.260
They said shit on Friends.

01:34:08.260 --> 01:34:09.260
Did they?

01:34:09.260 --> 01:34:10.260
Ah, I missed that.

01:34:10.260 --> 01:34:11.260
Yeah.

01:34:11.260 --> 01:34:12.260
The thing is...

01:34:12.260 --> 01:34:13.260
Yeah, it was one of...

01:34:13.260 --> 01:34:14.260
I can't believe I know this.

01:34:14.260 --> 01:34:19.620
I'm mildly embarrassing myself that I know this, but I remember it.

01:34:19.620 --> 01:34:24.180
It was one of the episodes where, you know, Rachel and Ross had a little, you know, confrontation

01:34:24.180 --> 01:34:26.860
and Rachel says, I'm sick of this shit.

01:34:26.860 --> 01:34:29.340
Wow, I wonder how that got by sensors.

01:34:29.340 --> 01:34:33.620
Anyway, Dark Sakura, I know you've got to have a comment on this because you're usually

01:34:33.620 --> 01:34:36.700
pretty passionate about these issues, so I'm curious what you think on this.

01:34:36.700 --> 01:34:43.140
It's more of a case of parents being stupid shits and not doing their goddamn job.

01:34:43.140 --> 01:34:45.340
It comes down to that.

01:34:45.340 --> 01:34:51.960
know we it's very sad that the state that our country has become where we

01:34:51.960 --> 01:34:56.200
supposedly have all this freedom and you know I actually have to sort of quote

01:34:56.200 --> 01:35:01.800
George Carlin last night because he said we used to be the land of the free we

01:35:01.800 --> 01:35:06.840
used to have all these rights remember when we could do this I was like you

01:35:06.840 --> 01:35:11.840
know that's pretty true because now you know it's like you and I were discussing

01:35:11.840 --> 01:35:18.480
previously, with my comment about being arrested at protesting, it doesn't matter if you've

01:35:18.480 --> 01:35:25.520
got a license to be there, if it's anything that's against the current administration,

01:35:25.520 --> 01:35:28.020
your ass will get locked up.

01:35:28.020 --> 01:35:33.600
You know where else they did that, the number of countries that were under dictatorship

01:35:33.600 --> 01:35:34.600
rule, huh?

01:35:34.600 --> 01:35:35.600
Yeah, I know.

01:35:35.600 --> 01:35:38.120
No, I totally agree with you.

01:35:38.120 --> 01:35:44.120
I keep going back to the South Park movie, Blame Canada. You know that song?

01:35:44.120 --> 01:35:51.120
There's all this crap. And all the freedoms that we have, all the things are being taken away.

01:35:51.120 --> 01:35:55.120
This country was perfect before Nintendo came along.

01:35:55.120 --> 01:36:02.120
We've gone from being ultimate Star Games. We've gone from being ultimate right wing.

01:36:02.120 --> 01:36:06.120
Did you know that Hitler and Stalin used to go over to each other's house and play Mortal Kombat after school?

01:36:06.120 --> 01:36:10.960
know that? You know, we've gone from being the ultimate right-wing to uber leftist

01:36:10.960 --> 01:36:17.080
and it's all, you know, it's all a bunch of bullshit. Wow, well thank you.

01:36:17.080 --> 01:36:21.680
Let's say we do a million gamer march. We start it here. I say we form our own planet.

01:36:21.680 --> 01:36:26.520
I think the million gamer march is a freaking brilliant idea. We just need to

01:36:26.520 --> 01:36:31.600
organize. But they're actually busy playing EverQuest. I'm your East Coast representation, Josie in the house.

01:36:31.600 --> 01:36:38.620
But knowing the gamer community, we'll try to organize ourselves and then we'll be all,

01:36:38.620 --> 01:36:39.620
ooh, new Halo.

01:36:39.620 --> 01:36:40.620
Too busy, gotta go play games.

01:36:40.620 --> 01:36:45.620
We'll be marching with our DS's and PSD's.

01:36:45.620 --> 01:36:48.620
Hooray, I'll finally be able to find a Picto chat room.

01:36:48.620 --> 01:36:51.620
Ha, I haven't found one since E3.

01:36:51.620 --> 01:36:56.620
Alright, we gotta let you go, but thank you so much for calling us, it was a good topic.

01:36:56.620 --> 01:36:57.620
Alright dude, take care.

01:36:57.620 --> 01:36:58.620
Have a good one buddy.

01:36:58.620 --> 01:36:59.620
Bye.

01:36:59.620 --> 01:37:00.620
Bye.

01:37:00.620 --> 01:37:09.120
That was good! I liked that. Even though that was a more general video gaming issue, you know what, I think we can do what we want on this program and we'll talk about that.

01:37:09.120 --> 01:37:10.120
That's what we're about.

01:37:10.120 --> 01:37:20.620
That's right. All right. I need some light in here. It's getting kind of dark. All right. I think we're going to go to a break. I'm kind of angry, so I want to hear some Taku, because I'm angry. And when I'm angry, I listen to Taku.

01:37:20.620 --> 01:37:21.620
Lots of Taku.

01:37:21.620 --> 01:37:29.620
Alright, so we're gonna hear some Taku, along with some other 2DX songs, because after Taku, to offset it, I have a little lovey song. I have a lovey-dovey song.

01:37:29.620 --> 01:37:33.140
alright so we'll be back after this with more orange on the radio and tonight's cage

01:37:33.140 --> 01:37:36.140
More news etc. etc. etc.

01:39:33.140 --> 01:39:35.140
You

01:41:03.140 --> 01:41:05.140

01:41:48.140 --> 01:41:53.140
You were either meant to be free

01:41:55.140 --> 01:42:00.140
Never killed any servant

01:45:00.140 --> 01:45:17.740
And now, let's listen in to an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting as they debate some of

01:45:17.740 --> 01:45:21.220
the new programming coming to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:45:21.220 --> 01:45:25.780
Jamie, I have a suggestion about some of the music in our Bamani Music and More program.

01:45:25.780 --> 01:45:27.000
Can we talk about that?

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.100
No subject will ever be taboo.

01:45:29.100 --> 01:45:35.840
Well, I was thinking maybe we should move pump up the volume from Tuesday nights except of course the subject that was just under discussion

01:45:36.580 --> 01:45:42.080
Okay. Well, what would you think if maybe we cut back on some of the tack music we play on the station?

01:45:42.080 --> 01:45:44.080
I collect your fucking head

01:45:45.580 --> 01:45:50.180
Just like this fucker here come on fuck the other one as you in there. Oh my god

01:45:50.180 --> 01:45:55.520
Why did you do that to Loki the holic thing on episode 69 was just a joke

01:45:55.520 --> 01:46:03.520
Now if any of you sons of bitches got anything else to say, NOW'S THE FUCKING TIME!

01:46:03.520 --> 01:46:08.520
Orange Lounge Radio, where everybody has a say.

01:46:11.520 --> 01:46:15.520
You know, you know what? I really sound a lot like Lucy Liu there.

01:46:15.520 --> 01:46:17.520
I'm a really good voice actor.

01:46:17.520 --> 01:46:19.520
You do, you're brilliant voice actors.

01:46:19.520 --> 01:46:27.720
The chat room is yelling about the speaking of new programming, because there was a post

01:46:27.720 --> 01:46:30.880
on our community earlier this week that said there was going to be a new show on Friday

01:46:30.880 --> 01:46:32.200
night.

01:46:32.200 --> 01:46:37.600
That was what we call a miscommunication, this little miscommunication between two parties.

01:46:37.600 --> 01:46:41.360
But at least you know that we're working on something, so we're not just resting on our

01:46:41.360 --> 01:46:42.360
laurels.

01:46:42.360 --> 01:46:47.380
There is new programming being under discussion for Orange Lawn's radio as we speak.

01:46:47.380 --> 01:46:48.680
So we will see what occurs.

01:46:48.680 --> 01:46:53.220
And there's not just that, I know of at least three projects being worked on right now.

01:46:53.220 --> 01:47:00.880
Just in short, chat room, unless it's me, or Rob, or Loki that posted it.

01:47:00.880 --> 01:47:01.880
Question.

01:47:01.880 --> 01:47:05.000
Unfortunately, yeah, you gotta kinda go with that rule, so.

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:15.440
Yeah, if neither of us post it, or it's not listed in there, or we don't confirm it, don't,

01:47:15.440 --> 01:47:17.320
not until one of us has confirmed it.

01:47:17.320 --> 01:47:20.360
OrangeLawnsRadio.com too, as much as we love the live drone community, OrangeLawnsRadio.com

01:47:20.360 --> 01:47:24.720
too is a great site to get all the latest news.

01:47:24.720 --> 01:47:28.400
So that's that, but there's all those fun projects, and if you have an idea for a show

01:47:28.400 --> 01:47:35.040
on OrangeLawnsRadio, we're not opposed to hearing what you got to offer us, so go to

01:47:35.040 --> 01:47:39.320
the Contact Us tab, send us an email and let us know what you have in mind, because we're

01:47:39.320 --> 01:47:42.600
not opposed to new programming, so let us know.

01:47:42.600 --> 01:47:49.360
OK, moving right along, I want to talk about some other news

01:47:49.360 --> 01:47:51.600
going on.

01:47:51.600 --> 01:47:53.080
Hey, Loki, turn off the damn game.

01:47:53.080 --> 01:47:54.520
We're doing a show here.

01:47:54.520 --> 01:47:56.200
Turn off the goddamn game, bastard.

01:47:58.900 --> 01:48:01.440
In the Groove, the game we've been talking about earlier

01:48:01.440 --> 01:48:03.840
today with the whole lawsuit business, they're

01:48:03.840 --> 01:48:05.320
still trucking along.

01:48:05.320 --> 01:48:07.680
They have a very interesting thing going on right now, the

01:48:07.680 --> 01:48:11.040
World Wide Road Rally 2005.

01:48:11.040 --> 01:48:14.140
And if you want more information on this Road Rally 2005,

01:48:14.140 --> 01:48:18.620
you can visit rockswordgames.com slash road rally slash,

01:48:18.620 --> 01:48:20.820
well, I'm looking, it's just rockswordgames.com

01:48:20.820 --> 01:48:21.660
slash road rally.

01:48:21.660 --> 01:48:24.740
I'm specifically looking at the events page right now.

01:48:24.740 --> 01:48:28.020
Eight events that they're trying to get people to compete in

01:48:28.020 --> 01:48:30.500
and this is like a nationwide tournament.

01:48:30.500 --> 01:48:32.260
I think this is their attempt at doing some type

01:48:32.260 --> 01:48:33.300
of nationwide tournament.

01:48:33.300 --> 01:48:35.140
Listen to the kinds of things they have here.

01:48:35.140 --> 01:48:39.660
Most locations played and you have to prove this

01:48:39.660 --> 01:48:46.040
copying down ITG serial numbers most unique locations which again I think is

01:48:46.040 --> 01:48:52.060
serial numbers total distance traveled how far did you go to visit locations

01:48:52.060 --> 01:48:54.960
now see I might be able to win this because I'm going to be going to the

01:48:54.960 --> 01:48:58.320
East Coast on a trip and I might play I in the groove to out there so maybe I

01:48:58.320 --> 01:49:06.680
should start looking for a team best marathon score best team photo you email

01:49:06.680 --> 01:49:13.000
them a photo and if they like it you win. Best freestyle, best costume, and best

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:18.220
overall most hardcore ITG freak. Is that is that grammatically correct? Best

01:49:18.220 --> 01:49:23.240
overall most hardcore ITG freak? I don't know. Regardless, if that interests you

01:49:23.240 --> 01:49:27.500
head on over to rockswargames.com slash road rally. Kind of interesting the idea

01:49:27.500 --> 01:49:31.280
of a national DDR tournament using pictures or video has been something

01:49:31.280 --> 01:49:35.080
toyed on for quite some time so it's very interesting I think anyway that the

01:49:35.080 --> 01:49:38.600
The company who puts out in the groove is endorsing this.

01:49:38.600 --> 01:49:39.600
Loki your thoughts?

01:49:39.600 --> 01:49:41.880
I'm sure you have some.

01:49:41.880 --> 01:49:45.600
I guess it's a good idea, whatever, I mean, where are the prizes?

01:49:45.600 --> 01:49:47.960
Oh, I didn't even look.

01:49:47.960 --> 01:49:48.960
Let's see.

01:49:48.960 --> 01:49:49.960
Sorry.

01:49:49.960 --> 01:49:50.960
For shame.

01:49:50.960 --> 01:49:51.960
Prizes.

01:49:51.960 --> 01:49:52.960
Trophies.

01:49:52.960 --> 01:50:03.240
Overall, most hardcore ITG freak gets two round-trip tickets to Las Vegas for the North

01:50:03.240 --> 01:50:04.240
American tournament finals.

01:50:04.240 --> 01:50:10.080
finals. You get your both! Most locations get up to three packages for the winning team.

01:50:10.080 --> 01:50:14.280
You basically get like a Megamix CD, a Red Octane ignition pad, a signed copy of In the

01:50:14.280 --> 01:50:21.280
Groove, and participation in a lawsuit. You're bad. I'm trying to look at what else they

01:50:21.280 --> 01:50:24.800
have here. I don't see a whole lot of... basically signed copies of In the Groove seem to be

01:50:24.800 --> 01:50:28.640
the big prizes. Some other Red Octane goodies thrown in there for good measure as well.

01:50:28.640 --> 01:50:33.160
So they're nothing to blink at, they're nothing to laugh at. They're kind of neat. Especially

01:50:33.160 --> 01:50:36.920
if you're a true ITG freak, then a signed copy of the game should, you know, get a rise

01:50:36.920 --> 01:50:43.920
out of you. Especially that Las Vegas thing, now that's a pretty good one there. And trophies!

01:50:43.920 --> 01:50:51.920
Who loves trophies? Logie. DarkSakura. I drove to play a shitty game and all I got was this

01:50:51.920 --> 01:51:00.200
stupid trophy. The trophy has a big dunce cap on it. So, let me get this straight here.

01:51:00.200 --> 01:51:05.620
And in the groove is sort of a wannabe DDR.

01:51:05.620 --> 01:51:10.180
So would that mean that an ITG freak would be a wannabe Bomani freak?

01:51:10.180 --> 01:51:11.180
You know what?

01:51:11.180 --> 01:51:12.900
Send in your application and see if you win.

01:51:12.900 --> 01:51:13.900
See what they tell you.

01:51:13.900 --> 01:51:16.520
Would that mean that they're posers?

01:51:16.520 --> 01:51:18.340
By the way, I'm being yelled at in the chatroom.

01:51:18.340 --> 01:51:21.940
This is the worldwide rally, not just the national.

01:51:21.940 --> 01:51:22.940
I forgot Canada.

01:51:22.940 --> 01:51:25.040
Sorry, because I know we have Canadian listeners.

01:51:25.040 --> 01:51:27.180
I forgot.

01:51:27.180 --> 01:51:29.220
You're all really close to the border anyway, right?

01:51:29.220 --> 01:51:33.660
it's a worldwide and I don't do they have ITG machines in Austria I think

01:51:33.660 --> 01:51:37.620
there's like one in Australia one in Europe so it's worldwide so if you're

01:51:37.620 --> 01:51:40.800
crazy if you're in Europe and you're freaking crazy enough to come to the

01:51:40.800 --> 01:51:44.660
States and play machines so you can win this contest hey more power to you

01:51:44.660 --> 01:51:51.260
more power to you who cares honestly I don't well I think the whole concept is

01:51:51.260 --> 01:51:54.620
what's need despite how you feel about the game the fact that the company is

01:51:54.620 --> 01:51:59.080
endorsing it is gonna fly people to Las Vegas that's kind of neat to me and they

01:51:59.080 --> 01:52:01.080
They might not be able to when they're broke.

01:52:01.080 --> 01:52:02.080
Stop.

01:52:02.080 --> 01:52:03.080
After the lawsuit.

01:52:03.080 --> 01:52:04.080
Alright.

01:52:04.080 --> 01:52:07.080
I'm going to laugh when that happens.

01:52:07.080 --> 01:52:13.080
I'm the most hardcore, I drove all around the country, I went to all these places.

01:52:13.080 --> 01:52:15.080
Yeah, but we went under.

01:52:15.080 --> 01:52:16.080
Good for you.

01:52:16.080 --> 01:52:17.080
Here's a sticker.

01:52:17.080 --> 01:52:19.480
Didn't that happen with Atari years ago?

01:52:19.480 --> 01:52:23.720
I was reading about like the Sword Quest finals or something and they canceled it before they

01:52:23.720 --> 01:52:24.720
got to the end.

01:52:24.720 --> 01:52:25.720
I don't know.

01:52:25.720 --> 01:52:28.620
something came up on um...

01:52:28.620 --> 01:52:31.020
something came up on uh... slashdot

01:52:31.020 --> 01:52:34.680
like a retro article on the whole thing or something from what I remember

01:52:34.680 --> 01:52:37.140
whatever

01:52:37.140 --> 01:52:41.780
alright kids i think it's about time to get into the orange lounge radio cage

01:52:41.780 --> 01:52:43.420
match

01:52:43.420 --> 01:52:44.840
sound good

01:52:44.840 --> 01:52:47.540
okey-dokey

01:52:47.540 --> 01:52:51.900
the way the cage match works we play three songs for your listening pleasure

01:52:51.900 --> 01:52:55.420
one song selected by each host

01:52:55.420 --> 01:52:59.760
And the winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's

01:52:59.760 --> 01:53:03.260
Bimani Music and More program, which plays 24 hours a day,

01:53:03.260 --> 01:53:07.060
seven days a week on this station, when we are not live.

01:53:07.060 --> 01:53:10.740
You only get to hear a clip of last week's winner, though, because it already won

01:53:10.740 --> 01:53:12.260
last week, so you've already heard it.

01:53:12.260 --> 01:53:15.180
So last week in the Cage match, we had a brand new winner.

01:53:15.180 --> 01:53:19.360
It's a band called The Ozoic, who is actually going to be in UltraMix 3,

01:53:19.360 --> 01:53:22.700
but this is a different song by The Ozoic. It's a song called

01:53:22.700 --> 01:53:26.780
Let Me Tell You Something. Remember, if you want to vote in the cage match, get your butt

01:53:26.780 --> 01:53:32.420
in our chat room, www.orangesomsradio.com. Click on chat. Here it is, song number one

01:53:32.420 --> 01:53:39.420
you can vote for tonight via Zoic with a clip of Let Me Tell You Something.

01:54:02.420 --> 01:54:05.420
You should know that I make time like no one is

01:54:05.420 --> 01:54:08.420
No time for you to go to no time

01:54:08.420 --> 01:54:10.420
Don't you come in and hide

01:54:10.420 --> 01:54:15.420
And you say you can't change my strength away, no way

01:54:15.420 --> 01:54:18.420
There's just so pretty people inside of me

01:54:18.420 --> 01:54:21.420
But now I'm searching all the things you say

01:54:21.420 --> 01:54:24.420
There's just so pretty people in your mind

01:54:24.420 --> 01:54:26.420
Who think that you're thinking

01:54:26.420 --> 01:54:29.420
What's left of me is condescending

01:54:29.420 --> 01:54:42.420
You think you can get to me, let me tell you something, I won't be pushed around, oh

01:54:42.420 --> 01:54:56.420
It's my life, I cannot give up anything You cannot break me down

01:55:12.420 --> 01:55:22.420
Alright, there was a clip of song number one, the Azoic, with Let Me Tell You Something.

01:55:22.420 --> 01:55:25.980
Let Me Tell You Something, that song is going for its second win tonight, so we'll see if

01:55:25.980 --> 01:55:30.940
that'll win or if one of these two new songs will dethrone the Azoic.

01:55:30.940 --> 01:55:33.060
We'll start it off with Loki's pick tonight.

01:55:33.060 --> 01:55:35.340
Loki, what did you choose for our lucky listeners?

01:55:35.340 --> 01:55:38.980
I chose a song called Wraiths because it's awesome.

01:55:38.980 --> 01:55:41.980
And it's also a new MIDI head track, so...

01:55:41.980 --> 01:55:44.980
Oh, okay. Goody goody, here we go.

01:55:44.980 --> 01:55:48.980
Monolithic with Wraith. Of course, I love it.

01:55:48.980 --> 01:55:50.980
Alright, does he sing in it?

01:55:50.980 --> 01:55:51.980
Yes.

01:55:51.980 --> 01:55:54.980
Dark Soccer, get ready for this one. Alright, here we go.

01:55:54.980 --> 01:56:01.980
monolithic with wraith

01:56:24.980 --> 01:56:34.980
I'm standing inside of me, taking my pride from within

01:56:34.980 --> 01:56:40.980
The darkness behind me speaks to me again

01:56:40.980 --> 01:56:45.980
I'm standing, speaking to me

01:56:45.980 --> 01:56:49.980
And if you survive, they'll bow at me

01:56:49.980 --> 01:56:52.980
And I will steal the threat

01:56:52.980 --> 01:56:55.980
Show me what I can turn in

01:56:56.980 --> 01:57:02.980
When what you know is mistaken

01:57:03.980 --> 01:57:10.980
And if we don't fall, then take it by

01:57:10.980 --> 01:57:13.980
You're raised in the dark

01:57:26.980 --> 01:57:30.980
Colliding inside of me

01:57:30.980 --> 01:57:34.980
The rays of an insanity

01:57:34.980 --> 01:57:38.980
It's blinding my soul from the flesh

01:57:38.980 --> 01:57:40.980
So where am I?

01:57:40.980 --> 01:57:42.980
I won't be in the night

01:57:42.980 --> 01:57:44.980
You can't hide the fighting

01:57:44.980 --> 01:57:48.980
You kill the heart that's deep in me

01:57:48.980 --> 01:57:52.980
Raise all that's life in me

01:57:52.980 --> 01:57:55.980
I can't see, I can't, I can't

01:57:55.980 --> 01:58:01.980
With what you know is mistaken

01:58:01.980 --> 01:58:12.980
And if you fall and take it by, you're raised in the dark

01:59:12.980 --> 01:59:29.980
Remember who you are, with what you know is a fake hell

01:59:29.980 --> 01:59:41.980
And if you fall, take it by, you'll raise it in the dark

01:59:41.980 --> 01:59:48.980
You'll raise it in the dark

02:02:18.980 --> 02:02:34.620
Okay, that was song number two, Monolithic with Wraith.

02:02:34.620 --> 02:02:39.700
Let's go around and see if it was good or bad, according to us.

02:02:39.700 --> 02:02:40.700
Dark Sakura.

02:02:40.700 --> 02:02:58.700
It sounds like what I would hear at the goth club I go to, so in that sense it's pretty generic and I still don't really care for his singing. I like the song overall, but it's pretty generic, so I give it about a 7.

02:03:28.700 --> 02:03:32.840
really try to see if he can't do like music scores for video games

02:03:32.840 --> 02:03:36.480
because I think I think if he coupled up with the right gaming company they could do a

02:03:36.480 --> 02:03:38.320
sweet soundtrack for a game

02:03:38.320 --> 02:03:44.280
I'd have to second that. I really do like I don't know why I mean DDR is one thing

02:03:44.280 --> 02:03:45.240
but he really

02:03:45.240 --> 02:03:49.400
like if the rumors are true and he's not into the album making things so much

02:03:49.400 --> 02:03:52.440
anymore he really ought to think about doing the video game scoring because

02:03:52.440 --> 02:03:56.640
I could hear that kind of music in a game like Devil May Cry or something, I don't know

02:03:56.640 --> 02:03:57.640
I just think it would kick out.

02:03:57.640 --> 02:04:02.640
Or even like, he does a lot of good instrumental stuff even just for other things, like media stuff.

02:04:02.640 --> 02:04:04.640
Seriously, gaming companies?

02:04:04.640 --> 02:04:07.640
Look this guy up, bittyhead.com, you should score your game.

02:04:07.640 --> 02:04:13.640
As for the song itself, Stand Alone, it's kind of a little too atmospheric to be a Stand Alone song for me.

02:04:13.640 --> 02:04:17.640
I think it's the type of song I'd enjoy more on the scope of an album.

02:04:17.640 --> 02:04:20.640
So in that sense, if that is the song on the album, I'm looking forward to the album.

02:04:20.640 --> 02:04:22.640
But the song itself, I'm not so hot on.

02:04:22.640 --> 02:04:25.640
So I'll stop talking and give it a seven and a half.

02:04:25.640 --> 02:04:28.380
Angel

02:04:28.380 --> 02:04:30.840
I liked it, it was pretty good.

02:04:30.840 --> 02:04:37.840
Maybe he had always been a plus in my book as far as music talent and stuff, so I'll give it an 8.

02:04:38.860 --> 02:04:46.040
An 8 from Angel. There you have it, but remember it's not our votes that make it important, it's your votes that count in the end, so get your butt in chat.

02:04:46.040 --> 02:04:54.920
One more song to go though, and it comes from DarkSakura. I put the wrong song in, I meant to copy what I put in there to a different folder, and ended up copying the wrong song.

02:04:54.920 --> 02:04:59.920
But hey, it's a good song. I like that it makes fun of clubs, yet it's played at clubs everywhere.

02:04:59.920 --> 02:05:02.920
So it's Blur, Girls and Boys.

02:05:02.920 --> 02:05:07.920
A little bit of Blur! Alright, I like Blur. Let's check this out. Blur with girls and boys. We'll be back after this.

02:05:32.920 --> 02:05:52.920
Street's like a jungle, the call of police Following the herd, down to Great

02:05:52.920 --> 02:06:02.920
On holiday, we love in the 90's It's paranoid

02:06:02.920 --> 02:06:11.920
On funny pictures, take your chances

02:06:11.920 --> 02:06:14.920
Don't give up, girls, we want boys, we want boys

02:06:14.920 --> 02:06:19.920
Two girls, two boys, we want girls Two girls, we want boys

02:06:19.920 --> 02:06:27.920
Always should be someone you really love

02:06:27.920 --> 02:06:31.920
Avoiding a word

02:06:31.920 --> 02:06:35.920
She says I'm available

02:06:35.920 --> 02:06:39.920
Like matter is in cut

02:06:39.920 --> 02:06:41.920
Candle falls

02:06:41.920 --> 02:06:43.920
I'm one, two, three, four

02:06:43.920 --> 02:06:47.920
I think that nothing is wasted

02:06:47.920 --> 02:06:51.920
Only we produce

02:06:51.920 --> 02:06:55.920
You cannot inflict us

02:06:55.920 --> 02:06:57.920
You've been special

02:06:57.920 --> 02:07:00.920
But we haven't been introduced

02:07:00.920 --> 02:07:02.920
Girls who are boys who are boys

02:07:02.920 --> 02:07:05.920
Girls who are boys are their girls

02:07:05.920 --> 02:07:07.920
Girls who are their boys

02:07:07.920 --> 02:07:15.920
Always should be someone you really love

02:07:15.920 --> 02:07:24.920
Girls love boys, love boys, big girls, boys love big girls, girls love big boys

02:07:24.920 --> 02:07:32.920
I should be someone to really love

02:07:47.920 --> 02:07:50.920
Looking for girls who are boys, who like boys

02:07:50.920 --> 02:07:56.920
You like boys, who be girls, who do boys, like they're girls, who do girls, like they're boys

02:07:56.920 --> 02:08:03.920
Oh, I should be someone you really love

02:08:03.920 --> 02:08:09.920
Girls who are boys, you like boys, who be girls, who do boys,

02:08:09.920 --> 02:08:13.420
Like they're girls, you do girls, like they're boys

02:08:13.420 --> 02:08:19.920
Oh, I should be someone you really love

02:09:19.920 --> 02:09:32.920
SONG number three in tonight's cage match, Blurr with Girls and Boys, Dark Sakura. What'd you think of that one?

02:09:32.920 --> 02:09:33.920
Ten. It's Blurr.

02:09:33.920 --> 02:09:35.920
How did I guess?

02:09:35.920 --> 02:09:36.920
Uh, Loki.

02:09:36.920 --> 02:09:39.920
Ah! Little steppy.

02:09:39.920 --> 02:09:48.920
I like the remix of the song a lot. The remix of the song, if you've attended that, it felt like something was missing.

02:09:48.920 --> 02:09:51.920
Well, that's the original.

02:09:51.920 --> 02:09:55.920
How can something be missing from the original?

02:09:55.920 --> 02:10:01.920
The remix! That's what's missing from it, because it sucked. The remix made it better, so it gets a six.

02:10:01.920 --> 02:10:03.920
I don't know who you are anymore.

02:10:03.920 --> 02:10:06.920
I want song two better!

02:10:06.920 --> 02:10:09.320
All right, where's song two is awesome

02:10:09.320 --> 02:10:14.280
Um, I would you know, I give this song itself a 10 because I love that song

02:10:14.280 --> 02:10:16.240
But I don't know it's a cage match pick

02:10:16.240 --> 02:10:19.440
I kind of like it when like songs I haven't heard but I know it was a mistake

02:10:19.600 --> 02:10:22.860
So as a song I give it a 10 that it's a cage match pick. I give it an 8

02:10:23.440 --> 02:10:25.440
sir angel

02:10:25.760 --> 02:10:27.760
It's blur is good

02:10:29.600 --> 02:10:35.320
May God thank God I didn't get done what I wanted to do. Mm-hmm. I have a remix

02:10:35.320 --> 02:10:40.420
I thought about doing that I'm looking at doing that you're gonna be like when when you hear you be like

02:10:40.860 --> 02:10:45.680
What is it? Oh, you know what Jamie's not in the room right now. Is it a gorillas mix or something? Is that?

02:10:46.780 --> 02:10:48.780
No, okay. I imagine

02:10:49.340 --> 02:10:51.220
it's

02:10:51.220 --> 02:10:56.220
Just just it's in a John Travolta movie. Oh boy. All right. All right. We'll see

02:10:56.700 --> 02:11:00.360
Is it like the Black Eyed Peas doing misery Lou or something? No, okay

02:11:00.360 --> 02:11:03.840
Alright, let's recap the three songs you can vote for tonight.

02:11:49.720 --> 02:11:50.720
Loki!

02:11:50.720 --> 02:11:54.700
This is always a part of the show where I ask you what's going on in the sim scene if anything

02:11:57.320 --> 02:12:00.920
Nothing well there was only one thing they were doing some new well

02:12:00.920 --> 02:12:05.040
They're a couple things actually I should mention, but myself doing other remix contest

02:12:06.160 --> 02:12:13.160
And in the thing now, it's no mash mixes unless they're very good, and that's that was their specific

02:12:13.160 --> 02:12:19.260
specific instructions there. I see. And then also... Hey, I have a great Max 300 mix I

02:12:19.260 --> 02:12:20.260
want to submit.

02:12:20.260 --> 02:12:29.600
Do you think I could win the Bimani style contest with this? I don't know, you know,

02:12:29.600 --> 02:12:35.720
something like that should be in a dancing game, like in the groove. Couldn't resist.

02:12:35.720 --> 02:12:42.160
That is so awful. It's like, come on. They didn't even try to make it sound different.

02:12:42.160 --> 02:12:47.480
I mean, it's... And then what the hell was the middle part there that had, like, nothing

02:12:47.480 --> 02:12:51.360
to do with the whole song? Because, you know, putting piano stuff in, like, a techno song,

02:12:51.360 --> 02:12:53.000
that's the hip thing to do.

02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:56.880
Look, look. You bashed on the game enough tonight. You've met your quota. Go back to

02:12:56.880 --> 02:12:57.880
The Sims.

02:12:57.880 --> 02:13:02.340
Fine, anyways. Nothing going on in The Sims scene, really. We're still waiting for the

02:13:02.340 --> 02:13:05.380
food mix two stuff to come out that's what I'm waiting for hopefully by the

02:13:05.380 --> 02:13:09.940
end of summer because we need another food mix release and really they meant

02:13:09.940 --> 02:13:15.140
that's all that's kind of going on a side note that's kind of interesting

02:13:15.140 --> 02:13:20.100
MIDI head who we've just heard a track from is going to be doing a podcast

02:13:20.100 --> 02:13:25.020
coming soon I believe the date is the 27th of July and it's going to feature

02:13:25.020 --> 02:13:31.380
all of his remix songs that he's done for dance dance revolution including the

02:13:31.380 --> 02:13:38.300
stuff that's going to be in Ultramix 3. So check that out. And if you don't check it

02:13:38.300 --> 02:13:40.900
out there, we will be replaying it on the show.

02:13:40.900 --> 02:13:46.020
Oh, will we now? All right, no, I wonder not. The songs, I definitely want to play that

02:13:46.020 --> 02:13:47.020
show with this mix.

02:13:47.020 --> 02:13:50.420
But yeah, he's hoping that they, that Konami gets behind this and like starts promoting

02:13:50.420 --> 02:13:56.740
his podcast on iTunes and that type of thing. You know, get the whole company thing going.

02:13:56.740 --> 02:14:17.740
Anyways, I'm still looking to remix some more songs. I've thought about a few things, and the next one I want to do is really strange. It's totally different. I don't even know if it's going to get off the ground. It's not a Bomani track at all. And I already told Rob what it was.

02:14:17.740 --> 02:14:24.740
I only half heard it, though. If it is what I thought you said, then yeah, very interesting.

02:14:24.740 --> 02:14:35.740
I don't know, when I heard the song again, when I was sitting in Mel's, it just sounded to me like, this could be a club track, it could be. Someone should have done a remix of this.

02:14:35.740 --> 02:14:46.740
But it's very strange, and I don't know if I can do it justice or even do a remix of it, so that's why I'm kind of keeping it under wraps for now.

02:14:46.740 --> 02:14:51.740
Okay. Should be interesting. Hey, tell me about this DM Ashura thing you were talking to me about earlier.

02:14:51.740 --> 02:15:08.740
Oh, yeah. DM Ashore is doing songs now for O2Jam, and yeah, they're still around. His new song for O2Jam is going to be Go, and they have a little preview. You can actually, there's a thread on Mysyle in their music production forum about it.

02:15:08.740 --> 02:15:14.500
So go check it out. Sounds sort of like techno with, you know, a bit of like the Japanese

02:15:14.500 --> 02:15:19.060
tribal stuff in there, you know, just kind of, you know, sort of like Japan or exotic

02:15:19.060 --> 02:15:24.260
ethnic type stuff. But it's really good. So definitely check it out. The only problem

02:15:24.260 --> 02:15:31.460
is it's a recording of someone playing it so it's not, you know, completely in sync

02:15:31.460 --> 02:15:37.940
but it's good enough. You get an idea. All right. But yeah, so that's kind of cool.

02:15:37.940 --> 02:15:42.620
How many Max remixes put out this week? You know, I haven't been downloading

02:15:42.620 --> 02:15:43.700
remixes on

02:15:43.700 --> 02:15:47.220
Bomani style, but you know, since we've got

02:15:47.220 --> 02:15:51.660
you know, a second here, let's... Actually I found this sim file and it had a real sweet Max

02:15:51.660 --> 02:15:52.860
remix in it. Wanna hear it?

02:15:52.860 --> 02:15:59.860
Couldn't resist, sorry.

02:15:59.860 --> 02:16:03.340
This is so

02:16:03.340 --> 02:16:06.700
wrong. So, so wrong. But anyways, um,

02:16:06.700 --> 02:16:12.540
let's see this week's uh... max remix uh... quota here

02:16:12.540 --> 02:16:14.400
doo doo doo doo doo

02:16:14.400 --> 02:16:19.220
alright and your total is

02:16:19.220 --> 02:16:22.380
oh it's like a telethon waiting for the big results

02:16:22.380 --> 02:16:26.420
uh... well let's see there wasn't too much this week uh...

02:16:26.420 --> 02:16:28.940
starting with uh...

02:16:28.940 --> 02:16:31.240
we have the legend of max

02:16:31.240 --> 02:16:32.920
uh... three hundred bpm

02:16:32.920 --> 02:16:41.920
Paranoia Climax Japan Mix, The Legend of Max Tribute and Max Attack, all of which are re-released.

02:16:41.920 --> 02:16:47.920
However, though, in June, there was quite a bit on the week beforehand. We had Maximizer,

02:16:47.920 --> 02:16:54.920
Max Naruku Jr., Max Beats, The Legend of Max Part 1, Paranoia Max Dirty Mix, Legend of

02:16:54.920 --> 02:17:05.220
megamix max 300 mutation and rave max oh and love it first max what about my max

02:17:05.220 --> 02:17:14.120
brings other boys to the yard all right you wait you wait you know what somebody

02:17:14.120 --> 02:17:18.180
should mix up max 300 and energizer together that'd be sweet what do you

02:17:18.180 --> 02:17:24.260
mean it you wouldn't hear it all right let's um let's hear tonight's cage match

02:17:24.260 --> 02:17:31.260
Are you kids ready for this? I guess. Tonight's cage match winner is... a tie.

02:17:31.260 --> 02:17:35.260
So you know how the ties work. Somebody's going to be breaking the tie. Let's find out who's breaking the tie.

02:17:35.260 --> 02:17:40.260
Song number one that is a tied song tonight is...

02:17:40.260 --> 02:17:42.260
Girls and Boys.

02:17:42.260 --> 02:17:44.260
People have taste.

02:17:44.260 --> 02:17:48.260
And song number two that is a tie tonight is...

02:17:48.260 --> 02:17:55.380
Yes, Zoick was letting me tell you something, so let me tell you something.

02:17:55.380 --> 02:17:59.180
This means Loki's got to break the tie, because his song didn't win.

02:17:59.180 --> 02:18:01.020
So what do you think, Loki?

02:18:01.020 --> 02:18:02.020
Holick?

02:18:02.020 --> 02:18:03.020
No.

02:18:03.020 --> 02:18:06.340
Um, which song do I dislike the most?

02:18:06.340 --> 02:18:13.220
I don't know, Zoick is just kind of, eh, no, I'm going to have to give it to Blur.

02:18:13.220 --> 02:18:14.220
Woohoo!

02:18:14.220 --> 02:18:16.100
You've redeemed yourself tonight, thank you.

02:18:16.100 --> 02:18:17.100
Whatever.

02:18:17.100 --> 02:18:21.800
that to redeem yourself with jamie

02:18:21.800 --> 02:18:28.800
you realize this is technically the the fourth song with damon singing this one

02:18:30.600 --> 02:18:33.020
wow

02:18:33.020 --> 02:18:35.140
all right there it is

02:18:35.140 --> 02:18:36.340
and you know what's sad

02:18:36.340 --> 02:18:38.680
i'd just got another vote

02:18:38.680 --> 02:18:41.220
and it would have broken the tie the other way

02:18:41.220 --> 02:18:44.360
too late you gotta get your votes in on time

02:18:44.360 --> 02:18:57.020
So then we have MaxToTheMax, HeadToToes280MaxSurvivor, and MaxSinsanity with Link.

02:18:57.020 --> 02:18:58.020
I think we're going to go to a break.

02:18:58.020 --> 02:19:02.540
When we come back from this break, of course the FUs of the week because we are angsty

02:19:02.540 --> 02:19:06.460
individuals and we are going to spread that angst throughout the world.

02:19:06.460 --> 02:19:08.980
And also when we come back, some Ask Orange Lounge if we have a little time.

02:19:08.980 --> 02:19:13.020
And you know what, while you're waiting for us to come back, you can also download such

02:19:13.020 --> 02:19:17.020
Simphiles as Max Tampon.

02:19:17.020 --> 02:19:21.020
That's lovely. That's very lovely.

02:19:21.020 --> 02:19:25.020
I think we need some Eurobeat in the house, so

02:19:25.020 --> 02:19:29.020
we're going to do some Eurobeat. You want to hear Velfire?

02:19:29.020 --> 02:19:33.020
I'd like to hear Velfire, thank you. Here it is, just for you

02:19:33.020 --> 02:19:37.020
DarkSakura. We'll be back after this.

02:20:07.020 --> 02:20:09.020
Come on!

02:20:21.020 --> 02:20:22.520
Hurry up, my little guy

02:20:22.520 --> 02:20:25.520
Everyone is getting all the secrets, baby

02:20:27.020 --> 02:20:28.520
Come on, baby, come on, boy

02:20:28.520 --> 02:20:30.520
Won't you really be the only one?

02:20:30.520 --> 02:20:31.520
It's Tokyo

02:20:33.020 --> 02:20:34.520
Now, bye, now, bye

02:20:34.520 --> 02:20:37.660
Flicking together with the dancing dancing

02:20:37.660 --> 02:20:39.020
You gotta move your moving

02:20:39.020 --> 02:20:40.680
Ba-ba, ba-ba

02:20:40.680 --> 02:20:43.160
Jumping together in the Eurobeat

02:20:43.160 --> 02:20:45.300
Ba come on and dance tonight

02:20:45.300 --> 02:20:48.200
Ba-ba into the music countdown

02:20:48.200 --> 02:20:51.260
Ba-ba into the new century

02:20:51.260 --> 02:20:53.780
Ba-ba into the future coming

02:20:53.780 --> 02:20:55.300
Here on there

02:20:55.300 --> 02:20:57.180
Ba-ba 2000

02:20:57.180 --> 02:21:00.040
Ba-ba into the music countdown

02:21:00.040 --> 02:21:03.240
Ba-ba into the new century

02:21:03.240 --> 02:21:05.740
The vampire distribution is coming

02:21:05.740 --> 02:21:07.240
You're on fire

02:21:07.240 --> 02:21:09.240
And back from 2000, come down

02:21:09.240 --> 02:21:11.240
Please don't smile

02:22:09.240 --> 02:22:11.240
Oh

02:24:09.240 --> 02:24:13.240
It's the seed of my heart, what you're feeling is mine

02:24:13.240 --> 02:24:16.240
And it feels you better stay behind

02:24:16.240 --> 02:24:19.240
It's the desiccant soul that you try to relieve

02:24:19.240 --> 02:24:22.240
You'll never understand, your heart can't function

02:24:22.240 --> 02:24:24.240
Feel it, feel it, baby

02:24:24.240 --> 02:24:28.240
Feel the fire, it's burning deep inside me

02:24:28.240 --> 02:24:30.240
Listen, listen, honey

02:24:30.240 --> 02:24:33.240
Listen to the music to you

02:24:33.240 --> 02:24:35.240
Listen to the heartbeat

02:25:05.240 --> 02:25:23.600
I'm not on my own I'm not on my own

02:25:23.600 --> 02:25:44.600
Welcome to the broken road, welcome to the painless deep of night

02:25:44.600 --> 02:25:50.600
Come on lady come and go, come on lady tell me what to write

02:25:50.600 --> 02:25:51.340
Right

02:25:53.740 --> 02:25:56.380
Not the danger, not the bet you're seeing

02:25:56.380 --> 02:25:59.420
Yeah, rock it, rock it, rock it, make it a throw

02:25:59.420 --> 02:26:02.540
I'll also name my name, I'll make it if you know

02:26:02.540 --> 02:26:05.900
I'll fly to the east, looking for me

02:26:05.900 --> 02:26:09.300
Yeah, night's on fire, you better, better stay

02:26:09.300 --> 02:26:12.260
You better, better be in the race to play

02:26:12.260 --> 02:26:15.420
Night's on fire, you better, better be

02:26:15.420 --> 02:26:18.140
You better, better stop, you'll never be

02:26:18.140 --> 02:26:20.140
You're a nightfall fighter

02:26:20.140 --> 02:26:22.140
You've got a lot of things

02:26:22.140 --> 02:26:24.140
You've got a battle to kill and pray and to slay

02:26:24.140 --> 02:26:26.140
Nightfall fighter

02:26:26.140 --> 02:26:28.140
Come over for the beat

02:26:28.140 --> 02:26:30.140
Come over, over the set

02:26:30.140 --> 02:26:32.140
You're a nightfall fighter

02:26:32.140 --> 02:26:43.860
Enjoy!

02:26:43.860 --> 02:27:02.020
So, orchestral music playing...

02:27:02.020 --> 02:27:06.020
What ever happened to Step Squad? Are they still doing stuff?

02:27:06.020 --> 02:27:10.020
We're supposed to be going to dinner sometime this month.

02:27:10.020 --> 02:27:14.020
Oh, that's nice. That's nice. Good bunch of kids, that Step Squad.

02:27:14.020 --> 02:27:17.020
With the exception of this one girl. Dark, sorry.

02:27:17.020 --> 02:27:18.020
Okay, thank you!

02:27:18.020 --> 02:27:20.020
I'm just kidding.

02:27:20.020 --> 02:27:25.020
In that break, you heard Velfaya 2000, Pandora, which is kind of Eurobeat.

02:27:25.020 --> 02:27:30.020
Natalie, or Nathalie actually, from 2DX7 style also, Initial D.

02:27:30.020 --> 02:27:34.820
We that song got played to death because it was the default song in the first mix of initial D heartbeat and

02:27:35.780 --> 02:27:38.660
But no, no, I'm kidding. No spaceboy was they sorry

02:27:38.660 --> 02:27:43.100
I'm sorry, but heartbeat was in it and they got played to death because we're all beat many people too

02:27:43.100 --> 02:27:45.560
And then Nico not a night of fire, which by the way

02:27:45.560 --> 02:27:49.480
We are such dorks because we were actually doing the para dancing. Although I couldn't remember it all it's hard

02:27:49.480 --> 02:27:51.840
I remembered it cuz I'm a bigger nerd than you are

02:27:51.840 --> 02:27:55.720
It's hard without the high-heeled girl doing it helping you out and doing it for you

02:27:55.720 --> 02:27:59.800
You know, I kind of wish I feel really gay for saying this, but that's okay

02:27:59.800 --> 02:28:03.460
I kind of wish Para Para would make a comeback like in the u.s. I know

02:28:04.300 --> 02:28:10.700
They tried to open a part of our club in LA did they really I think it's sort of in there pioneers releasing the Para Para

02:28:10.700 --> 02:28:16.320
Para Para CDs here. They need they need to have a Para Para. I've been buying the anime Para Para CDs

02:28:16.320 --> 02:28:19.840
They should have a Para Para TV show on a ZN television. Have you seen this?

02:28:20.100 --> 02:28:26.460
There's a I get a ZN TV now a rebranded international channel is a Z and now you have a reason to watch TV the

02:28:26.460 --> 02:28:29.460
You know what? No, because I caught Fushigi Yugi dubbed.

02:28:29.460 --> 02:28:37.460
I'm sorry, I wanted to pour bleach into my head, shake it around, pour it back out, and then follow it up with, like, witch hazels or something.

02:28:37.460 --> 02:28:43.460
I saw some pretty funny sitcom on there the other day. It was some Filipino sitcom, I think it was. It was cute. I liked it.

02:28:43.460 --> 02:29:00.460
Alright, moving right along, we're going to get into the angsty angsty FUs of the week, but you should send in your FUs as well, because I know you guys probably have some angst, but this is the part of the show where you can release that angst. We encourage you to.

02:29:00.460 --> 02:29:06.820
Alright, so that being said, DarkSakura, why is it that we have to do these FUs every single

02:29:06.820 --> 02:29:07.820
week?

02:29:07.820 --> 02:29:08.820
Uh...

02:29:08.820 --> 02:29:28.580
Big FU goes to the fucking hurricane, because, you know, I was all really, really worried

02:29:28.580 --> 02:29:36.220
about my family, and it was just a bunch of crap. I was getting all sick, and, you know,

02:29:36.220 --> 02:29:43.140
and then the hurricane, like, hit Sarasota. So it was like, I'm glad it didn't hit Mobile.

02:29:43.140 --> 02:29:49.780
It's sort of, I feel let down, in a really, you know, messed up way, but at least, you

02:29:49.780 --> 02:29:53.540
know, I'm glad my family and all my friends out in the area are doing okay, and I'm sorry

02:29:53.540 --> 02:30:04.780
for poor poor Sarasota. Another F.U. goes to my digestive system for, I guess, not working

02:30:04.780 --> 02:30:15.120
anymore. Because I've been going through, digestion hurts worse than being hungry right

02:30:15.120 --> 02:30:22.360
now. And that's a horrible state just for someone to find oneself in. So I don't think

02:30:22.360 --> 02:30:28.880
I'm gonna like eat for a week and see if that helps cuz I was starting to feel better before

02:30:28.880 --> 02:30:34.420
I came here and actually felt a little hungry so I ate a handful of Brazil nuts and then

02:30:34.420 --> 02:30:49.420
drank a liter of water and guess what? I feel sick. Fun huh? An SU goes to buses, not buses,

02:30:49.420 --> 02:30:56.420
Like 18-wheelers who drive on the left lane on a two-lane street, especially the winding

02:30:57.180 --> 02:31:04.180
mountain road going Torino. Yeah. Y'all can, you know, drive off into a ravine or something.

02:31:06.420 --> 02:31:10.980
Another F.U. goes to 18-wheelers that try to pass other 18-wheelers. It's just sort

02:31:10.980 --> 02:31:17.980
of pointless because they can't really go all that fast anyway. And that's really it.

02:31:17.980 --> 02:31:27.980
Fuck you to my mouse for the left mouse button to stop working. It doesn't want to click no more.

02:31:27.980 --> 02:31:34.220
I've clicked it way too many times and now it just it's practically works the other mouse buttons worked fine

02:31:34.220 --> 02:31:36.220
So I had to buy a new mouse yesterday

02:31:36.460 --> 02:31:40.420
Which put me at Best Buy and then I had to get in a stupid person line

02:31:40.420 --> 02:31:43.500
And you know how that goes where for some reason?

02:31:43.500 --> 02:31:46.340
I don't know this person for me is buying like a ton of shit or something because

02:31:46.580 --> 02:31:51.140
Their receipt was about like, you know, it took the printer five times to print it out or something

02:31:51.300 --> 02:31:55.280
You know have the feet the paper through five times. It's just like nuts anyways

02:31:55.280 --> 02:32:14.280
Um, fuck either of that, and fuck either of the fact that there's no food in my house right now, at least nothing that I feel like eating, because it's all leftovers, and I have like this big thing I combined, um, some steak with the minestrone, and so it's this weird mistakey, and um, yeah, that's not very good.

02:32:14.280 --> 02:32:37.280
And then, my work. Um, it's okay. But, um, I don't know. I've just, like, been kind of feeling drained lately. I've been trying to stay up to, like, really late on the weekends, but I've been unable to do that for some reason. Just feeling really drained, and that sucks. And fuck you to the stupid drivers, because they're always in my way.

02:32:37.280 --> 02:32:41.280
And, um, uh...

02:32:41.280 --> 02:32:44.280
In the Groove Sucks!

02:32:44.280 --> 02:32:46.280
Are you done?

02:32:46.280 --> 02:32:49.280
Um, and, um, you know those Macs?

02:32:49.280 --> 02:32:51.280
My toaster has better processing power than them.

02:32:51.280 --> 02:32:53.280
You're done.

02:32:57.280 --> 02:33:01.280
Um, I would like to give an FU to the assholes who broke into my car for the second time.

02:33:01.280 --> 02:33:06.280
And that's another $100 deductible that I won't be seeing anytime soon, so you can fight me.

02:33:06.280 --> 02:33:12.280
I'd also like to give a nephew distress because I was so stressed out on Friday like I got

02:33:12.280 --> 02:33:17.420
I got this work thing like dropped on me literally at the last minute and on a normal day that

02:33:17.420 --> 02:33:20.880
would have been okay but I was dealing with other stresses that day as well and I just

02:33:20.880 --> 02:33:24.240
wanted to die on Friday like seriously like I was so stressed this doesn't happen to be

02:33:24.240 --> 02:33:29.320
very often but I was stressed where like I could taste vomit like I'm gonna barf I swear

02:33:29.320 --> 02:33:33.220
I'm gonna barf although I didn't barf but I really wanted to and that sucks to go around

02:33:33.220 --> 02:33:37.500
all day going, I'm gonna barf, no I'm not. That's how I felt, right? So, F you to barfing.

02:33:37.500 --> 02:33:44.500
Cause that's no fun, nobody likes that. Except Loki, when he's drunk. What, Loki? I said

02:33:44.500 --> 02:33:48.460
funny, that's what I felt like on Sunday. Very funny, except you did barf. I don't know

02:33:48.460 --> 02:33:54.820
if you remember. I remember a few of them. We all remember. He sat there on the carpet.

02:33:54.820 --> 02:33:58.800
I don't even remember falling on the floor, though. You didn't fall, you were just sitting

02:33:58.800 --> 02:34:07.920
there and he leaned over and out came all the contents of anastronian alcohol. I sort

02:34:07.920 --> 02:34:13.920
of averted my eyes politely.

02:34:13.920 --> 02:34:19.560
Alright, that's it for my FUs by the way. So let's go on to DDR Angel.

02:34:19.560 --> 02:34:26.300
Actually it's more of an honest FU as far as, you know, the shit that happened in London.

02:34:26.300 --> 02:34:28.440
Fuck that. Don't mess with people's lives.

02:34:28.440 --> 02:34:32.440
Hey, I doubly, doubly add to that.

02:34:32.440 --> 02:34:38.440
Okay, because I spent all day, even though, like, their, uh, what?

02:34:38.440 --> 02:34:41.440
Our early morning is their lunch time or whatever.

02:34:41.440 --> 02:34:44.440
Even though I heard about it, something like that.

02:34:44.440 --> 02:34:47.440
Anyway, like, you know, I heard about it at 3 o'clock in the morning,

02:34:47.440 --> 02:34:51.440
and the first thing I thought of was, you know, like, Liam and all those people over there,

02:34:51.440 --> 02:34:54.440
and I was just worried about it, and I'm glad that he's okay,

02:34:54.440 --> 02:34:57.440
and I'm glad that the rest of my friends in the UK are okay and they're alive.

02:34:57.440 --> 02:35:02.140
I got I got a text message for my sister in the morning about it cuz she's she

02:35:02.140 --> 02:35:04.940
visited London an awful lot cuz her ex-husband's from there and while I

02:35:04.940 --> 02:35:09.320
personally don't know anybody except for some of our listeners that are over in

02:35:09.320 --> 02:35:16.140
that area it's just a horrible thing it's a horrible thing doesn't that what

02:35:16.140 --> 02:35:19.860
else can I say what else can be said you know it's a horrible thing that shouldn't

02:35:19.860 --> 02:35:25.620
exist in this world exactly some people that I know are saying like you know we

02:35:25.620 --> 02:35:28.800
we should get used to it or whatever because that's what the world is coming to now and

02:35:28.800 --> 02:35:29.800
it's just like no.

02:35:29.800 --> 02:35:30.800
No, no, no.

02:35:30.800 --> 02:35:31.800
No.

02:35:31.800 --> 02:35:35.960
The whole point is for all of us to stick together and, you know, pretty much reward

02:35:35.960 --> 02:35:39.440
the mob saying, hey, no matter how much you hurt us, we're still going to stick together.

02:35:39.440 --> 02:35:43.840
Yeah, at the same time, I refuse to be terrorized by terrorists.

02:35:43.840 --> 02:35:49.240
So I will be continuing to do my function in this world, which is not only my day job,

02:35:49.240 --> 02:35:53.960
but to spread shit about people I don't like all over the internet.

02:35:53.960 --> 02:36:00.960
So you know what? Fuck you guys, we're gonna catch you and that's it. You're done.

02:36:00.960 --> 02:36:06.960
And we're gonna go on with our lives and do what we do on a day-to-day basis.

02:36:06.960 --> 02:36:09.960
And that's it, I'm done.

02:36:09.960 --> 02:36:11.960
Alright. Let's get to chatroom FUs.

02:36:11.960 --> 02:36:38.320
42 would like to say F you to the fascist douche bags that run our country and the parents

02:36:38.320 --> 02:36:42.400
who go crying to them every time little Timmy shoots up his physics class because he played

02:36:42.400 --> 02:36:46.240
Mortal Kombat when he was 12.

02:36:46.240 --> 02:36:52.080
Sakurina says, F you to EA for having some bastard registration system on their PS2 online

02:36:59.240 --> 02:37:04.040

Sad face.

02:37:36.800 --> 02:37:39.200

Dirty Thief says, F you to Taco Bell for making me fat.

02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:44.680
You know what?

02:37:44.680 --> 02:37:47.960
You have the choice to either or not.

02:37:47.960 --> 02:37:50.840
And MPQ says, F you to Las Vegas.

02:37:50.840 --> 02:37:52.960
Thanks for telling me that if you're not 21

02:37:52.960 --> 02:37:54.920
and you can't spend hundreds of dollars an hour,

02:37:54.920 --> 02:37:56.400
you might as well be five.

02:37:56.400 --> 02:37:57.080
Thanks, Vegas.

02:37:57.080 --> 02:37:58.760
Thanks for being 90 degrees at night.

02:37:58.760 --> 02:38:01.480
Thanks for making it a chore just to go outside.

02:38:01.480 --> 02:38:03.280
F you to driving in Oregon.

02:38:03.280 --> 02:38:08.800
Attention Oregon your speed limits are too low. Also, you can't pump your own gas there. I agree

02:38:08.880 --> 02:38:12.620
What the fuck are people too stupid to put the hose in the tank there or something?

02:38:13.040 --> 02:38:19.380
Eff you to driving through the middle of nowhere. I hope I never see another next exit 10 miles or no services sign again. I

02:38:20.360 --> 02:38:22.360
Agree, what's up with that?

02:38:22.360 --> 02:38:26.280
We're not a pump your own gas. That's what we do. That was the last if you anyway

02:38:26.840 --> 02:38:29.720
It's the same thing in New Jersey

02:38:29.720 --> 02:38:33.880
think it is where you can't pump your own gas and somebody told me it's to

02:38:33.880 --> 02:38:46.160
create jobs okay all right uh moving right along we're gonna get into some

02:38:46.160 --> 02:38:49.560

02:38:59.480 --> 02:39:05.480
Can I just give a reminder to folks out there that right now Red Octane is putting together that game Guitar Hero?

02:39:05.480 --> 02:39:17.480
Well, they want your contributions. If you happen to be in a rock band, you could be alongside songs made famous by David Bowie, Red Hot Chili Peppers, White Zombies, The Ramones, Hendrix.

02:39:17.480 --> 02:39:19.480
Hey, we should form a band.

02:39:19.480 --> 02:39:20.480
Seriously, we should form a band.

02:39:20.480 --> 02:39:22.480
And be really awful.

02:39:22.480 --> 02:39:23.480
Sense of music.

02:39:23.480 --> 02:39:26.480
I can't play anything but saxophone and clarinet.

02:39:26.480 --> 02:39:37.600
we could remix Max 300 and send it in. No. No. No. Although I'm thinking about taking

02:39:37.600 --> 02:39:42.560
guitar lessons next semester. That's cool. I used to be able to play keyboards. Loki,

02:39:42.560 --> 02:39:49.680
you want to be our singer? No. Come on. People love your singing. You could just scream angrily.

02:39:49.680 --> 02:39:51.680
It would be awesome.

02:39:51.680 --> 02:39:53.680
I'm staying in.

02:39:53.680 --> 02:39:55.680
Come on, you know you want to.

02:39:55.680 --> 02:39:57.680
No!

02:39:57.680 --> 02:39:59.680
Oh, it would be awesome.

02:39:59.680 --> 02:40:01.680
Wimp!

02:40:01.680 --> 02:40:03.680
I'll be the triangle player.

02:40:03.680 --> 02:40:05.680
I'll give you some maracas.

02:40:05.680 --> 02:40:07.680
You can play the gong.

02:40:07.680 --> 02:40:09.680
There'll be the samba de amigo maracas.

02:40:09.680 --> 02:40:11.680
We'll just wheel out the giant gong and then at the end Loki just

02:40:11.680 --> 02:40:13.680
Bong!

02:40:13.680 --> 02:40:15.680
That would be hideous.

02:40:15.680 --> 02:40:17.680
Animal!

02:40:17.680 --> 02:40:23.760
for you is like a truck bazaar car. You know what, Loki should... Loki's gonna have to

02:40:23.760 --> 02:40:27.360
learn how to play drums. That's what it is. Loki, you learn how to play drums. Dude, all

02:40:27.360 --> 02:40:33.760
the greats have played drums, like Don Henley. We'll bribe... we'll bribe... we'll bribe

02:40:33.760 --> 02:40:42.760
Iguana Girl to be our singer. Okay. Alright. Anyway, if you want to... Our band would be

02:40:42.760 --> 02:40:47.080
awesome even though our band is destined to be in this game if you want to try

02:40:47.080 --> 02:40:51.400
and compete against us you piddly fools or you have a friend who's in a band who

02:40:51.400 --> 02:40:58.480
is feeling like competing against us fools go to www.beaguitarhero.com and

02:40:58.480 --> 02:41:09.280
submit your entry and you too can be a guitar hero all right I guess since

02:41:09.280 --> 02:41:11.280
There's no questions for AskOrangeLohan.

02:41:11.280 --> 02:41:16.280
Ask us a question or we will talk about the Lindsay Lohan.

02:41:16.280 --> 02:41:18.280
No, we'll go to a quick break.

02:41:18.280 --> 02:41:19.280
We're going to do like a quick little Tucson break.

02:41:19.280 --> 02:41:22.280
But I want to talk about Lindsay Lohan.

02:41:22.280 --> 02:41:26.280
I want to talk about, well, I have BeatMania on my PSP.

02:41:26.280 --> 02:41:28.280
Tell us about this then.

02:41:28.280 --> 02:41:31.280
I have a Game Boy Color emulator called Rin on there,

02:41:31.280 --> 02:41:34.280
and I found a ROM for BeatMania 2.

02:41:34.280 --> 02:41:37.280
And so now I have BeatMania on my PSP.

02:41:37.280 --> 02:41:40.280
As well as DDR, but I took DDR off there because that was annoying.

02:41:40.280 --> 02:41:45.280
I found that DDR2 for the Game Boy Color had all the solo songs in it, though.

02:41:45.280 --> 02:41:49.280
In their 8-bit glory.

02:41:49.280 --> 02:41:56.280
But Hot Limit's in there. I gotta pull up Hot Limit. That'd be funny. We'll play that.

02:41:56.280 --> 02:41:57.280
Alright.

02:41:57.280 --> 02:42:03.280
Oh, this is probably going to make my heart hurt or something.

02:42:03.280 --> 02:42:08.280
If I wind up in the hospital because of hearing this song, and I die there, I'm going to haunt you.

02:42:09.280 --> 02:42:10.280
Just thought I'd let you know.

02:42:10.280 --> 02:42:13.280
Do you think Lindsay Lohan looks better with red hair or her new blonde hair?

02:42:13.280 --> 02:42:14.280
I think the red hair looks better.

02:42:14.280 --> 02:42:15.280
I don't care!

02:42:15.280 --> 02:42:18.280
I think, I think though she needs to eat something.

02:42:18.280 --> 02:42:20.280
Yes, she needs to eat something.

02:42:20.280 --> 02:42:21.280
Did you hear about that website?

02:42:21.280 --> 02:42:23.280
Eat Lindsay, or Free Lindsay or something?

02:42:23.280 --> 02:42:24.280
What?

02:42:24.280 --> 02:42:25.280
What is it?

02:42:25.280 --> 02:42:27.280

02:42:27.280 --> 02:42:28.280
Or is a petition going around trying to-

02:42:28.280 --> 02:42:30.280
It smells like fresh Lindsay in here!

02:42:30.280 --> 02:42:38.760
here. Is that your Lindsay that I see? Maybe. Are you talking about my Lindsay? Maybe. Alright,

02:42:38.760 --> 02:42:41.680
we're starting to get some questions for Ask Orange Lounge, so I guess we should go into

02:42:41.680 --> 02:42:48.120
that segment, should we? Yes? Do you got that song for us yet? I'm working on it, I'm working

02:42:48.120 --> 02:42:59.320
on it. Alright, here we go. We'll go into Ask Orange Lounge first. This sounds like

02:42:59.320 --> 02:43:06.320
like a Mega Man game or something.

02:43:12.320 --> 02:43:13.320
This is not a hot limit.

02:43:13.320 --> 02:43:17.320
Oh, here we go.

02:43:17.320 --> 02:43:24.320
Wow.

02:43:47.320 --> 02:43:54.320
do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do a-a-a-a. Interesting.

02:43:54.920 --> 02:44:01.160
All right let's get to the questions. Enough of that.

02:44:01.160 --> 02:44:03.740
feedlindsay.com

02:44:03.740 --> 02:44:07.200
Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question,

02:44:07.200 --> 02:44:10.680
well will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:44:10.680 --> 02:44:14.440
Is Lindsay better as a redhead or is she a buck some blonde?

02:44:14.440 --> 02:44:18.440
I don't know, you tell me, but secretly I think she's not fat.

02:44:22.440 --> 02:44:24.440
I have boobies on my PSP.

02:44:24.440 --> 02:44:26.440
I hate having to improvise that song every week.

02:44:27.440 --> 02:44:31.440
First question from Sakurina. Can you not talk about Lindsay Lohan?

02:44:32.440 --> 02:44:37.440
Oh my god, did you hear what she did last week? This is so awesome.

02:44:37.440 --> 02:44:40.520
them

02:44:40.520 --> 02:44:45.780
but come on i thought that i saw her be the look no forget it i'm going to try

02:44:45.780 --> 02:44:49.340
and peak you want to know why does nobody asked questions i think the

02:44:49.340 --> 02:44:52.760
reason nobody asked questions is because we do this almost every other week and

02:44:52.760 --> 02:44:54.280
we really need a new bed

02:44:54.280 --> 02:44:56.400
but we're just not feeling creative

02:44:56.400 --> 02:45:00.460
honestly maybe for episode one fifty which is next week by the way

02:45:00.460 --> 02:45:03.200
we'll have something new and fresh for you guys but until then it's the same

02:45:03.200 --> 02:45:10.200
old stale shit you know and love.

02:45:33.200 --> 02:45:35.200
Well, there's pictures of us online.

02:45:35.200 --> 02:45:37.200
They're little, little bitty pictures. Hold on, let me show you.

02:45:37.200 --> 02:45:39.200
I have not seen them.

02:45:39.200 --> 02:45:41.200
Yes, you have. I showed this to you last week.

02:45:41.200 --> 02:45:43.200
It's on our website, right? I haven't seen this, actually.

02:45:43.200 --> 02:45:45.200
Hold on, hold on, hold on. Let me bring it up.

02:45:45.200 --> 02:45:47.200
Now you're making me work.

02:45:47.200 --> 02:45:49.200
You better work!

02:45:49.200 --> 02:45:53.200
No, I haven't seen this, because I was trying to come up with something that I didn't.

02:45:53.200 --> 02:45:55.200
Mmm.

02:45:55.200 --> 02:45:58.200
Orange lion. Oh, sorry, I had to bring it up the pocket. There it is!

02:45:58.200 --> 02:46:04.200
See? I like that. See? Me, DarkSakura, Loki, Ferret.

02:46:04.200 --> 02:46:08.200
What's that on? That's our album art for our podcast.

02:46:08.200 --> 02:46:10.200
Oh, really? Yeah. That's great.

02:46:10.200 --> 02:46:13.200
I posted it on our forum. Hey, that's the icon that I made.

02:46:13.200 --> 02:46:16.200
Yeah, that's the old-ass icon you made, and then I did the border around it, so we kind of co-made it.

02:46:16.200 --> 02:46:18.200
That's fun. That's cool.

02:46:18.200 --> 02:46:22.200
And the Ferret is our official fourth co-host. Yes.

02:46:22.200 --> 02:46:26.200
She says the same thing every time, though.

02:46:26.200 --> 02:46:28.200
No, we should totally get sponsorship from Scusi.

02:46:28.200 --> 02:46:30.200
We totally should.

02:46:30.200 --> 02:46:33.200
We pimp those ferrets like nothing else.

02:46:33.200 --> 02:46:35.200
God, we really do.

02:46:35.200 --> 02:46:40.200
Ronchan wants to know, can I be the band manager and book y'all at the Apollo Theater?

02:46:40.200 --> 02:46:42.200
Fuck yeah, bring it on.

02:46:42.200 --> 02:46:45.200
Oh, fuck no, we'd get booed off at the Apollo.

02:46:45.200 --> 02:46:47.200
You know what?

02:46:47.200 --> 02:46:50.200
Spelling bee at the Apollo!

02:46:50.200 --> 02:46:59.240
Asphyxiation! A-S-F-I-X-O-N! No. Actually, I have heard somebody try to spell asphyxiation

02:46:59.240 --> 02:47:02.040
that way. It was just sad.

02:47:02.040 --> 02:47:06.440
MPQ is making an interesting suggestion. He says, and this is actually live in the chat

02:47:06.440 --> 02:47:09.440
room at orange-on-the-radio.com. Click on chat. He didn't send his over private message,

02:47:09.440 --> 02:47:14.520
but he says, let's play the wolf game next week in the chat and radio-ize it. You know

02:47:14.520 --> 02:47:18.920
what? I'm not against the idea of doing like some type of broadcasted the wolf game, but

02:47:18.920 --> 02:47:21.240
But I don't know how that would work with the chat.

02:47:21.240 --> 02:47:22.760
We'd have to have live people.

02:47:22.760 --> 02:47:23.480
Could be interesting, though.

02:47:23.480 --> 02:47:24.640
Could be very interesting.

02:47:24.640 --> 02:47:29.280
I'd have to think about the, what do you call that,

02:47:29.280 --> 02:47:31.880
schematics, the way it would work.

02:47:31.880 --> 02:47:32.640
Let me think about that one.

02:47:32.640 --> 02:47:34.680
MPQ, if you have an idea on how we could do that and

02:47:34.680 --> 02:47:36.960
actually have it be good radio, send me an email.

02:47:36.960 --> 02:47:37.920
We'll talk.

02:47:37.920 --> 02:47:39.480
Might be fun.

02:47:39.480 --> 02:47:40.400
I'm liking this.

02:47:40.400 --> 02:47:42.520
I'm liking this.

02:47:42.520 --> 02:47:44.000
All right.

02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:45.640
We have no more questions, you guys.

02:47:45.640 --> 02:47:46.600
Who's?

02:47:46.600 --> 02:47:47.440
Email what?

02:47:47.440 --> 02:47:53.320
what? We need to have questions. This is what we do, usually when we get no questions, is

02:47:53.320 --> 02:48:00.320
that we can ask each other questions. Rob, why are you so fabulous? Because I am a diva.

02:48:00.320 --> 02:48:09.320
Hey Rob, why am I so famous? Because you're a diva. Because I'm a diva. Angel, you haven't

02:48:09.320 --> 02:48:12.560
been here in a month, surely you must have. Where the heck have you been? Where have you

02:48:12.560 --> 02:48:20.160

that's what's going on I got wrist slap for that one all right see now the chat

02:48:41.200 --> 02:48:45.160
I'm starting to like that idea I want to figure that one out. All right let's um

02:48:45.160 --> 02:48:48.120
we're gonna go to a quickie break here and then when we come back from this

SmileDK this break. Enjoy. We'll be back after this.

02:49:30.600 --> 02:49:33.100
Just a little bit of me to say

02:49:33.100 --> 02:49:36.100
You know you gotta try a little harder

02:49:36.100 --> 02:49:39.600
Or you can be my, my, my, my darlin'

02:49:39.600 --> 02:49:41.100
Smile, a little smile

02:49:41.100 --> 02:49:42.600
Let's enjoy the moment now

02:49:42.600 --> 02:49:45.100
And just have a good time

02:49:45.100 --> 02:49:46.100
A good time

02:49:46.100 --> 02:49:47.600
Try it baby, good

02:49:47.600 --> 02:49:52.100
A little bit of love and gonna feel so fine

02:49:52.100 --> 02:49:53.600
Is it really true

02:49:53.600 --> 02:49:55.100
That you feel the same way too

02:49:55.100 --> 02:49:59.600
And hope we'll be together now

02:49:59.600 --> 02:50:07.560
You know that I love you, love you, love you love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you...

02:50:07.560 --> 02:50:10.520
When I'm sitting thinking of,

02:50:10.520 --> 02:50:13.860
The funny one we called love,

02:50:13.860 --> 02:50:16.640
Still don't think of you at first,

02:50:16.640 --> 02:50:20.140
My family, they come so far...

02:50:20.140 --> 02:50:23.200
If you wanna capture me,

02:50:23.200 --> 02:50:26.240
It's as simple as can be,

02:50:26.240 --> 02:50:29.260
Mr. Leonard said it all, you need it,

02:50:29.260 --> 02:50:32.340
Mix a little set it all, you need it

02:50:32.780 --> 02:50:35.180
Mix a little set it all, you need it

02:50:35.220 --> 02:50:38.200
Love, my love my love my love my love

02:50:38.280 --> 02:50:41.440
My love my love my love my love my love

02:50:41.440 --> 02:50:42.440
Let's go!

02:51:11.440 --> 02:51:23.440
I'm so much love, always something's all I know

02:51:23.440 --> 02:51:26.440
I'm trying not to kill me, yeah

02:51:26.440 --> 02:51:29.440
I'm all that I wish to do is turn inside and out

02:51:29.440 --> 02:51:32.440
We cry bitches everywhere

02:51:32.440 --> 02:51:35.440
I'm just figuring out what's left and find some fun

02:51:35.440 --> 02:51:39.440
It's time to get excited, so come on everybody

02:51:39.440 --> 02:51:42.440
Boys, boys, be my boy, I wanna feel your body

02:51:42.440 --> 02:51:45.440
Boys, boys, be my boy, you got a ranny, honey

02:51:45.440 --> 02:51:49.440
Boys, boys, be my boy, I wanna be your lover now

02:51:49.440 --> 02:51:51.440
Be my boy

02:51:51.440 --> 02:52:19.440
Boy, boy, be my boy

02:52:19.440 --> 02:52:39.600
We're back here on Orange Lounge Radio, coming here to wrap it all up. You know when I get

02:52:39.600 --> 02:52:43.160
bored though as I start looking through popular DDR forums to see what the kids are talking

02:52:43.160 --> 02:52:48.920
about and why is it that on DDR forums there is always this kind of topic at

02:52:48.920 --> 02:52:52.440
least on DDR freak and some of the other big ones there's always this kind of

02:52:52.440 --> 02:52:56.920
topic within the first three pages of a forum have you ever met your boyfriend

02:52:56.920 --> 02:53:02.760
or girlfriend through DDR I don't know how about it guys have you ever met your

02:53:02.760 --> 02:53:08.440
boyfriend girl the topic it keeps popping up on every incarnation of DDR

02:53:08.440 --> 02:53:16.440
freak, and honestly, as a moderator, I'm not even saying it! Fucking people, stop posting inane crap!

02:53:16.440 --> 02:53:20.440
Why can't we have intelligent conversation? Like...

02:53:20.440 --> 02:53:24.440
Well, some people did meet their boyfriend or girlfriend through DDR, which I think is...

02:53:24.440 --> 02:53:26.440
But this is an old thread.

02:53:26.440 --> 02:53:28.440
Yeah, I did, but what business of it is yours?

02:53:28.440 --> 02:53:30.440
Ha ha ha ha!

02:53:30.440 --> 02:53:34.440
Well, that is the first time I've ever heard Angel say something snide. It's great.

02:53:34.440 --> 02:53:36.440
I'm learning! Oh my God, we're corrupting you!

02:53:36.440 --> 02:53:38.440
I live with Andrew!

02:53:38.440 --> 02:53:40.440
Oh, did I say that out loud?

02:53:40.440 --> 02:53:44.440
Oh, that was beautiful.

02:53:44.440 --> 02:53:46.440
Save that one for the archives.

02:53:46.440 --> 02:53:48.440
Angel gets mean. Episode 149.

02:53:48.440 --> 02:53:52.440
Finally, after, uh, how many episodes?

02:53:52.440 --> 02:53:56.440
Maybe it's sitting next to Loki lately.

02:53:56.440 --> 02:53:58.440
He's starting to rub off on you or something.

02:53:58.440 --> 02:54:02.440
Either that or it's, um, I don't know.

02:54:02.440 --> 02:54:05.400
all of our randomness coming off on me?

02:54:08.400 --> 02:54:13.640
Maybe people post this topic because they're sad because

02:54:13.640 --> 02:54:15.960
they want to meet a girl through DDR.

02:54:15.960 --> 02:54:18.400
They're sad and lonely, and they want to meet a girl with

02:54:18.400 --> 02:54:20.600
similar interests as them.

02:54:20.600 --> 02:54:21.960
Here's the hint.

02:54:21.960 --> 02:54:25.040
They want to meet a girl with similar interests as you.

02:54:25.040 --> 02:54:30.240
Go outside and participate in those interests that you have.

02:54:30.240 --> 02:54:32.680
Because if you want to find a girl that plays DDR,

02:54:32.680 --> 02:54:35.720
you know where you're likely to find that girl that plays DDR?

02:54:35.720 --> 02:54:36.520
I don't know.

02:54:36.520 --> 02:54:39.360
Out playing DDR somewhere.

02:54:39.360 --> 02:54:40.960
Food for thought.

02:54:40.960 --> 02:54:44.640
So my advice, if you're lonely, and sad, and single,

02:54:44.640 --> 02:54:45.880
and you want to meet somebody.

02:54:45.880 --> 02:54:48.800
And you know what, I'm a lonely, sad, single guy, but I try.

02:54:48.800 --> 02:54:51.160
I go out and do things I enjoy, because that

02:54:51.160 --> 02:54:55.520
is where I'm likely to meet people who have similar interests that I have.

02:54:55.520 --> 02:54:56.960
So I suggest you all do the same.

02:54:56.960 --> 02:55:01.360
of course now we've got all these

02:55:01.360 --> 02:55:07.960
comments here in the chat room there. What are you talking about upskirt cam for DarkSakura?

02:55:07.960 --> 02:55:11.680
I was doing that just to make fun of the DDR stuff.

02:55:11.680 --> 02:55:16.480
Oh. Yeah that's when I got subjected to that in 2003.

02:55:16.480 --> 02:55:21.000
Okay I'm not funny. See? Wait whoa whoa whoa whoa.

02:55:21.000 --> 02:55:26.200
You were in an upskirt cam video? Angel was not in an upskirt cam video!

02:55:26.200 --> 02:55:30.960
no I got subjected to the term upskirt cam in 2003

02:55:30.960 --> 02:55:34.200
I get it I get it

02:55:34.200 --> 02:55:39.160
all right kids it's time we end this train wreck of a show

02:55:39.160 --> 02:55:43.600
put the nails in the coffin go around and get everybody's final thought next

02:55:43.600 --> 02:55:47.160
week boys and girls it's episode 150

02:55:47.160 --> 02:55:51.160
holy crap are we getting old

02:55:51.160 --> 02:55:58.160
69. I don't remember 69, because I was... Wait, your mic's off, I think. No, it's not.

02:55:58.840 --> 02:56:03.840
There... Ooh, it died for me. Yeah, the mic is going out. There you go. I don't remember

02:56:03.840 --> 02:56:07.840
episode 69, because I was in San Diego living under the stairs in the Harry Potter room.

02:56:07.840 --> 02:56:13.080
I remember that. You weren't... It was a gay frat. That was great. Alright. So I don't

02:56:13.080 --> 02:56:16.800
know, what are we going to do... I was surrounded by all these cute guys, and they were all

02:56:16.800 --> 02:56:21.080
gay. What are we going to do for episode 150? I mean, that's a pretty big number. I don't

02:56:21.080 --> 02:56:22.080
I say it's time we-

02:56:22.080 --> 02:56:23.080
JUNK SHUT UP!

02:56:23.080 --> 02:56:24.080
No.

02:56:24.080 --> 02:56:25.080
I say it's time we-

02:56:25.080 --> 02:56:26.080
No.

02:56:26.080 --> 02:56:27.080
No more of those for a long time.

02:56:27.080 --> 02:56:28.080
No.

02:56:28.080 --> 02:56:29.080
No, no, no, no, no.

02:56:29.080 --> 02:56:30.080
I say we set the ferret on fire.

02:56:30.080 --> 02:56:31.080
NO!

02:56:31.080 --> 02:56:32.080
Oh my god, Rob, no.

02:56:32.080 --> 02:56:33.080
Ah.

02:56:33.080 --> 02:56:34.080
There we go.

02:56:34.080 --> 02:56:35.080
All right.

02:56:35.080 --> 02:56:39.080
We could rent a wood chipper and throw the ferret through a wood chipper.

02:56:39.080 --> 02:56:40.080
Yes.

02:56:40.080 --> 02:56:41.680
Okay, what?

02:56:41.680 --> 02:56:44.720
We'll just try- we'll try performing surgery on that a little later.

02:56:44.720 --> 02:56:45.720
Here, here.

02:56:45.720 --> 02:56:46.720
Let me try something.

02:56:46.720 --> 02:56:48.440
Here, let's switch for a minute.

02:56:48.440 --> 02:56:53.240
What the fuck did the ferret ever do to you, okay?

02:56:53.240 --> 02:56:55.780
The ferret has been good to you.

02:56:55.780 --> 02:56:56.780
The ferret has been nice.

02:56:56.780 --> 02:56:57.780
Check, check.

02:56:57.780 --> 02:56:58.780
Here we go.

02:56:58.780 --> 02:57:07.440
The ferret has been very good to you, yet you treat it so horribly.

02:57:07.440 --> 02:57:12.520
I mean, do you have some sort of deep-rooted fear of ferrets?

02:57:12.520 --> 02:57:15.920
You know, ferret bias, or...

02:57:15.920 --> 02:57:19.040
We're going to land ourselves an extra special guest for episode 150, we're going to work

02:57:19.040 --> 02:57:20.040
on that.

02:57:20.040 --> 02:57:21.040
You know what I would love to get?

02:57:21.040 --> 02:57:24.700
I should send an email this week, see if I can make it happen, because I have connections.

02:57:24.700 --> 02:57:28.440
We should get some of the folks that made In the Groove on the show to argue with Loki.

02:57:28.440 --> 02:57:29.440
I think it would be beautiful.

02:57:29.440 --> 02:57:30.920
Oh my god, Rob.

02:57:30.920 --> 02:57:33.040
You just got a song stuck in my head.

02:57:33.040 --> 02:57:34.040
Do it!

02:57:34.040 --> 02:57:35.040
Do it!

02:57:35.040 --> 02:57:36.040
That connected song.

02:57:36.040 --> 02:57:37.040
The Get Yourself Connected.

02:57:37.040 --> 02:57:40.200
Who was it that did that fucking song?

02:57:40.200 --> 02:57:42.200
This shit is bananas.

02:57:42.200 --> 02:57:43.200
B-A-N.

02:57:43.200 --> 02:57:44.200
No, forget it.

02:57:44.200 --> 02:57:45.200
It's on the wall.

02:57:45.200 --> 02:57:48.200
Alright, alright. The chat room is suggesting we have an orgy.

02:57:48.200 --> 02:57:50.200
I think that was Fluke.

02:57:50.200 --> 02:57:54.200
Episode 150 is Girls Only. Yeah, screw you. Screw you. Thank you.

02:57:54.200 --> 02:57:56.200
Alright, let's go around and do it by a final thought.

02:57:56.200 --> 02:57:58.200
Yeah, Girls Only. All breaks would be...

02:57:58.200 --> 02:58:00.200
Girls...

02:58:00.200 --> 02:58:02.200
Girls.

02:58:02.200 --> 02:58:04.200
It took me a minute to get that joke.

02:58:04.200 --> 02:58:06.200
Alright Angel, your final thought.

02:58:06.200 --> 02:58:10.200
Meteors was interesting, but I'm still playing it.

02:58:10.200 --> 02:58:11.200
Loki.

02:58:11.200 --> 02:58:18.200
is hard to play on a PSP, or Game Boy Advance for that matter, or Game Boy Color. My final

02:58:18.200 --> 02:58:25.200
thought is, word around the office is you got a fat cock. Dark Sakura. I don't know

02:58:25.200 --> 02:58:36.200
how I can top that one. I do. You should have seen how her eyes looked all of a sudden.

02:58:36.200 --> 02:58:46.200
I'm gonna report you to HR! Oh, wait. I am HR. Guess what we do. We flog.

02:58:46.200 --> 02:58:49.200
Nah, we're all up for those medieval forms of...

02:58:49.200 --> 02:58:51.200
They flog the dolphin.

02:58:51.200 --> 02:58:54.200
Well, I was gonna go flog the...

02:58:54.200 --> 02:58:57.200
No, forget it.

02:58:57.200 --> 02:59:01.200
No, we use, like, whips and chains and...

02:59:01.200 --> 02:59:05.280
Okay, it's, it's, I was telling somebody about an anime called Star Trap,

02:59:05.280 --> 02:59:09.280
Ascenders of the Universe, so I'm going to go ahead and quote a line for that.

02:59:09.280 --> 02:59:14.280
Eat me, beat me, make me write bad checks.

02:59:14.280 --> 02:59:18.280
And the final word of the show, one word to sum the whole damn thing up.

02:59:18.280 --> 02:59:22.280
I'm going to give it to DDR Angel, come on Angel, you haven't been here for a month.

02:59:22.280 --> 02:59:24.280
One word, sum it all up.

02:59:24.280 --> 02:59:28.280
Uh, that's it, bye.

02:59:28.280 --> 02:59:34.280
That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.

02:59:34.280 --> 02:59:39.280

And now, here is your fortune cookie message of the day.

03:00:17.280 --> 03:00:26.480
Was it just, was it just, was it just, yeah, was it just, was it just what you were?

03:00:26.480 --> 03:00:30.480
Worlds were in the space between us, I should have made a sacrifice,

03:00:30.480 --> 03:00:36.480
Or tried to meet a set of standards, I had a pretty good selection, of masters of the universe,

03:00:36.480 --> 03:00:40.480
I had Boba Fett and Greedo, and I was close to 17,

03:00:40.480 --> 03:00:44.480
C.S.A. took Dr. Connick any log, and she knew how to pass with J,

03:00:44.480 --> 03:00:48.480
Shitty head eyes and look around for the boys who lie his legs to go to hate

03:00:53.480 --> 03:00:57.480
At the time I was working on a novel, just another proof of my distraction

03:00:57.480 --> 03:01:00.480
I come first wondering what she would think of that

03:01:01.480 --> 03:01:05.480
What if I had wilder words of fiction, overwind and crack a smile lakeside

03:01:05.480 --> 03:01:09.480
When she had just moved back up and moonwalked home

03:01:09.480 --> 03:01:11.480
There was a girl she took away

03:01:11.480 --> 03:01:13.480
While we're in the space between us

03:01:13.480 --> 03:01:15.480
I guess I should have made a sacrifice

03:01:15.480 --> 03:01:17.480
Or tried to meet her down at Sanders

03:01:17.480 --> 03:01:19.480
But she didn't have respect for her strength

03:01:19.480 --> 03:01:21.480
As I didn't have the strength for that

03:01:21.480 --> 03:01:23.480
Ruben's shoes burned on my style

03:01:23.480 --> 03:01:25.480
And they're still not, I was in the D&D

03:01:25.480 --> 03:01:30.240
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na na

03:01:55.480 --> 03:02:07.160
When I look back upon the 80s I never get pissed off at Ronald Reagan

03:02:07.160 --> 03:02:13.240
I never paid attention to him back then But that chick who wore the parachute pants

03:02:13.240 --> 03:02:15.240
The one who broke my heart, the one who broke hands

03:02:15.240 --> 03:02:22.240
I just hope that one day we'll meet again I'm not sure, I'm not sure, I'm not sure

03:02:22.240 --> 03:02:25.240
So I'm not sure, I'm not sure what I would do

03:02:25.240 --> 03:02:27.240
I'm not sure it even matters

03:02:27.240 --> 03:02:31.240
Because I know where everything is and she's got stuff stuck up in her ass

03:02:31.240 --> 03:02:33.240
And it flows through the doors of my distance

03:02:33.240 --> 03:02:36.240
She can only, she can only, she can only

03:02:36.240 --> 03:02:43.240
Eat us up alive, eat us up alive

03:02:43.240 --> 03:02:59.840
La, la, la, la, la, la...

03:02:59.840 --> 03:03:06.840
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.

03:03:29.840 --> 03:03:47.840
Closing time. You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here. That's it. Show's over.

03:03:47.840 --> 03:03:52.840
So piss off! Can I come back next week? No, yeah, come back in 15 seconds, because we're

03:03:52.840 --> 03:03:55.840
going to reconnect to the Beaumonti Music and More program with all your favorite TDR

03:03:55.840 --> 03:03:59.840
And listen to my show Tuesday, Pump Up the Lame.

03:03:59.840 --> 03:04:00.840
And listen to the podcast, because we're cool.

03:04:00.840 --> 03:04:01.840
Good night everybody!

03:04:01.840 --> 03:04:02.340
Bye.
