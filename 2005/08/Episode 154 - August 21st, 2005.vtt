Look at us, baby, look at us now

06:45.400 --> 06:48.900
Like the power of the wind, the glowin' of the moon

06:48.900 --> 06:52.700
Look at us, baby, look at us now

06:52.700 --> 06:56.000
Baby, from the way that we can ever be

06:56.000 --> 06:59.700
Look at us, baby, look at us now

06:59.700 --> 07:03.200
Now all the good is gone, I knew it all the time

07:03.200 --> 07:06.900
We'd make it today, look at us now

07:06.900 --> 07:09.380
This is what you're gonna...

07:23.540 --> 07:26.220
We are what we're supposed to be

07:26.220 --> 07:28.980
Illusions are the fantasy

07:28.980 --> 07:31.540
Under the light, we can face

07:31.540 --> 07:34.740
What you do is what you wish to do

07:34.740 --> 07:37.240
We are the call to save our days

07:37.240 --> 07:39.740
We do the things you want to see

07:39.740 --> 07:42.740
Bring my brain to the X-ray

07:42.740 --> 07:45.740
Our friends are so unreasonable

07:45.740 --> 07:48.740
They do the unpredictable

07:48.740 --> 07:50.740
All out alive if we can say

07:50.740 --> 07:54.240
What we do and what can we do?

07:54.240 --> 07:56.740
There's all an order for friends

07:56.740 --> 07:59.240
Doing all the little things

07:59.240 --> 08:01.740
Bring my brain to the X-ray

08:01.740 --> 08:04.740
One by one we make it in five

08:04.740 --> 08:07.740
We are the time to be heroes of the world

08:07.740 --> 08:10.740
We are the ones who got our hands on our robot

08:10.740 --> 08:12.740
It's game by your back, rage in mind

08:12.740 --> 08:14.740
One of the wildest of our days

08:14.740 --> 08:17.740
I'll never get to fight back

08:17.740 --> 08:18.740
We're on the move, we're on the path

08:18.740 --> 08:21.740
Time to run, to qualify

08:21.740 --> 08:22.740
We come to the end

08:22.740 --> 08:23.740
We're never gonna land

08:23.740 --> 08:27.740
We're the man, we're the man, we're the kind of people, kind of people, kind of people, yeah

08:44.740 --> 08:47.740
Often you just walk away from me

08:47.740 --> 08:50.740
When all I can do is watch you leave

08:50.740 --> 08:54.740
Cause we shared the laughter and the pain

08:54.740 --> 08:57.740
And even shared the tears

08:57.740 --> 09:03.740
You're the only one who really knew me at all

09:03.740 --> 09:07.740
So take a look at me now

09:07.740 --> 09:10.740
You're very open as you say

09:10.740 --> 09:14.740
And you coming back to me is against the odds

09:14.740 --> 09:19.740
And that's why I'm not afraid

09:19.740 --> 09:23.740
I wish I could just make you turn around

09:23.740 --> 09:26.740
Turn around and make me cry

09:26.740 --> 09:30.740
There's so much I need to say to you

09:30.740 --> 09:33.740
So many reasons why

09:33.740 --> 09:39.740
You're the only one who really knew me at all

09:39.740 --> 09:43.740
So take a look at me now

09:43.740 --> 09:51.340
There's just a lefty thing And there's nothing left here to remind me

09:51.340 --> 09:57.340
Just a memory of a friend Take a good look at me now

09:57.340 --> 10:03.340
Cause I can still be standing here If you turn it back to me

10:03.340 --> 10:10.840
If you get caught up, the chance I've got to pay

10:33.340 --> 10:36.140
Bring me back to Rainbow Track

10:36.140 --> 10:39.040
Give me your gun and my hand

10:39.040 --> 10:41.840
I wanna be your shooting man

10:41.840 --> 10:44.540
Left by left

10:44.540 --> 10:47.340
The military staff

10:47.340 --> 10:50.140
The air force raft

10:50.140 --> 10:53.140
The 70 is the best

10:53.140 --> 10:55.840
Go left or right, don't pick up the map

10:55.840 --> 10:58.840
Go left or right, go left

11:28.840 --> 11:44.560
Go left, go right, go pick up set, go left, go right, go left.

11:44.560 --> 11:51.000
Gaming radio, so uncensored, that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.120
Mooch, uh, moo-kaw-key.

11:53.120 --> 11:55.120
Orange Lounge Radio.

11:55.120 --> 12:05.560
We're back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 154 on this lovely, hot August night

12:05.560 --> 12:08.880
here in the Sacramento area where our show is based.

12:08.880 --> 12:10.460
Welcome to our new listeners.

12:10.460 --> 12:11.920
I'm sure we have a couple new listeners tonight.

12:11.920 --> 12:15.840
It seems like ever since we started that little podcast thing, we've been getting a trickle

12:15.840 --> 12:18.120
of new listeners every week to the live show.

12:18.120 --> 12:20.840
So hello to you guys that came over from the podcast.

12:20.840 --> 12:24.640
For those of you guys that are expecting a three-hour version of our podcast, we apologize,

12:24.640 --> 12:29.640
but that's not what we do here. Because we have three hours to film...

12:29.640 --> 12:32.640
Yeah, we talk about music gaming.

12:32.640 --> 12:38.640
Sometimes we talk about music gaming, and then other times we talk about other crazy, much crazier stuff.

12:38.640 --> 12:41.640
So, you're kind of quiet, Loki, all of a sudden.

12:41.640 --> 12:44.640
Well, gee, I'm either too loud or too quiet, you know?

12:44.640 --> 12:45.640
There you go, now we're fine.

12:45.640 --> 12:47.640
Can't win.

12:47.640 --> 12:50.640
So what do we do here on the show? We talk about the music-based video games,

12:50.640 --> 12:53.640
which was what our podcast was originally going to be about, but then we got way off track.

12:53.640 --> 12:58.880
way off track. And then we also talk about, you know, pop culture stuff when it, you know,

12:58.880 --> 13:03.560
comes up, like strippers and things like that. And, you know, just whatever is on our mind.

13:03.560 --> 13:06.480
So that means we always start off each and every show with a little bit of how was your

13:06.480 --> 13:10.880
week, how was your day, where we talk about what's been going on for you this week. So

13:10.880 --> 13:14.080
without talking about any of the Bomani news this week that you guys know is coming up

13:14.080 --> 13:17.520
later in the show, how was your week, how was your day? We'll start off with Loki, since

13:17.520 --> 13:19.120
Dark Sakura's not here tonight.

13:19.120 --> 13:22.920
My week was pretty good because, um, it just was.

13:22.920 --> 13:28.600
I got to play some more games, um, Darkwatch for, you know, briefly.

13:28.600 --> 13:32.120
Then I got bored of Darkwatch after about five minutes just because, you know, first

13:32.120 --> 13:35.120
person shooters, eh, I just didn't have the time to dedicate to it.

13:35.120 --> 13:40.440
So Burnout 3 it was because I took down 54 cars in one match, and that was fucking awesome.

13:40.440 --> 13:43.880
That was one of the best races I've done.

13:43.880 --> 13:48.320
It was just like, I was in the zone, just like, knocking off cars, you know, three at

13:48.320 --> 13:53.240
every time and loved it. You have been obsessed with Burnout 3 just like I have been obsessed

13:53.240 --> 13:58.680
with Meteos. I cannot stop. And now, Mikoltov is obsessed with Meteos. Well, then also I

13:58.680 --> 14:02.820
got to play actual music games. I got to play Taiko no Tatujin while I was waiting for Nelly

14:02.820 --> 14:09.240
to get out of the doctors. Um, cause you know, since I, the car. On the PSP. You didn't lug

14:09.240 --> 14:15.440
the big drum into the doctor's office or anything. I do lug my PS2 around though. I do do that.

14:15.440 --> 14:19.480
So, and I kid you not, this is how addicted to Burnout 3 I am.

14:19.480 --> 14:22.800
I will lug my PS2, I carry it with me to work.

14:22.800 --> 14:26.240
I'll lug it downstairs, we'll hook it up to the TV, we'll play two races and unhook it

14:26.240 --> 14:29.200
up in a matter of 15 minutes.

14:29.200 --> 14:31.280
That's how addicted we are to this game.

14:31.280 --> 14:36.560
But um, so anyways, I got to play a Taika no Tatujin and um, beat about half the songs,

14:36.560 --> 14:38.860
you know, completely 100%.

14:38.860 --> 14:41.680
So now I have to figure out what happens when I beat everything.

14:41.680 --> 14:54.680
I don't know. It's pretty fun. And that's pretty much all I did that was super exciting. I saw a 40-year-old virgin and that movie is hilarious. I love it. Highly recommend it.

14:54.680 --> 14:57.680
Was it funnier than There's Something About Mary? Because that's what a lot of people just say.

14:57.680 --> 15:07.680
Yeah. It was one of those movies you actually laugh out loud. It was just really funny. Steve Carell is awesome and all the supporting cast was awesome as well. So, really good movie.

15:07.680 --> 15:11.400
uh... coming from the chair of fire above us as uh... any game that enables

15:11.400 --> 15:15.480
you to produce final destination to pile up for great

15:15.480 --> 15:17.880
remember the beginning of that

15:17.880 --> 15:19.640
if you want to play her chat

15:19.640 --> 15:23.060
and have comments randomly written read on a row orange laundry dot com click on

15:23.060 --> 15:23.760
chat back

15:23.760 --> 15:26.320
that's the difference between the show the podcast really is that you get

15:26.320 --> 15:29.560
interact with us the thing is that they have a very three dollars i can find

15:29.560 --> 15:31.400
cheat codes for it

15:31.400 --> 15:34.660
you know it being on my hard drive it makes you a hard to cheat there is a way

15:34.660 --> 15:38.740
the Codebreaker version 9, I guess you can do that by 8, so I have to see if I can upgrade

15:38.740 --> 15:44.420
that or something. But yeah, it looks like it's going to be really fun, and I'm waiting

15:44.420 --> 15:49.900
for Burnout Revenge, because that's next month. I have to play the Madden demo, because they

15:49.900 --> 15:50.900
have that on there.

15:50.900 --> 15:54.220
Now for those that would say, us a couple folks in chat room are saying that Burnout

15:54.220 --> 16:00.760
3 is not all that. What are the flaws in Burnout 3?

16:00.760 --> 16:08.580
The Announcer, Striker, fucking lame ass piece of crap, it's like some, no offense Rob, college

16:08.580 --> 16:11.580
DJ, okay, that's on MTV, okay?

16:11.580 --> 16:12.580
Hey!

16:12.580 --> 16:13.580
Okay, no.

16:13.580 --> 16:14.580
I think I got my start.

16:14.580 --> 16:15.580
No, no, no.

16:15.580 --> 16:16.580
Hey!

16:16.580 --> 16:21.380
You're listening to Chico State Radio, and that was some Beck, comin' up for Beck!

16:21.380 --> 16:28.260
No, honestly, it's very annoying, and I've turned the Announcer off a few times and it

16:28.260 --> 16:29.260
keeps coming back.

16:29.260 --> 16:40.260
And also, if you don't play the World Race mode right off the bat, you'll keep getting these stupid training videos that pop up, and they're like five minutes long and you can't bypass any of them. That sucks.

16:41.260 --> 16:47.260
And also, some of the physics in the game are a little touchy, and the AI is a bit too rubber bandy, and it's just, I don't know.

16:47.260 --> 16:53.260
But Burnout Revenge, from what I hear, fixes all of that, and the game is amazing. I can't wait!

16:53.260 --> 17:02.260
Because you can also do, I guess, you can do these where you can make your car explode in Burnout Revenge when you crash and you just go BOOM!

17:02.260 --> 17:04.260
So I love that. Explosions are awesome.

17:04.260 --> 17:07.260
Alright. Explosions are awesome.

17:07.260 --> 17:10.260
Miklotov, put the game on pause. Tell us about your wig.

17:10.260 --> 17:12.260
He's got a mic. He's got Jamie's mic.

17:12.260 --> 17:14.260
Um, okay.

17:14.260 --> 17:16.260
Oh, now you're loud! Whoa, good. Alright.

17:16.260 --> 17:24.260
I play Final Fantasy XI a lot, and I got my artifact armor part of the way for Bard, and it made me very happy.

17:24.260 --> 17:32.260
And I was sick Friday. That's about it. And I worked.

17:32.260 --> 17:33.260
You worked a lot this week?

17:33.260 --> 17:36.260
Yes, and I hated it. I hated it so much.

17:36.260 --> 17:42.260
Don't talk about it, you don't like it. Don't say that when Konami people might be listening to the show, you dumbass.

17:42.260 --> 17:47.260
I don't care. I make it known what I like and I don't like at work.

17:47.260 --> 17:49.260
Oh, so it's the particular thing you're working on.

17:49.260 --> 17:50.260
Yeah, I hate it.

17:50.260 --> 17:52.260
Can you, I guess you probably can't tell us what.

17:52.260 --> 17:58.260
No, no. But I hate it. I hate it for ten to twelve hours a day, every day and weekends.

17:58.260 --> 18:00.260
Can you please make sure they don't make any more Frogger games?

18:00.260 --> 18:06.260
Because I have to sell this to people and I'm like, it's a Frogger game that's 3D.

18:06.260 --> 18:08.260
It's based off the original Frogger.

18:08.260 --> 18:10.260
And, well, it's a Frogger game.

18:10.260 --> 18:14.260
If you can take care of Hawaii, it's all Hawaii.

18:14.260 --> 18:17.260
So, let's just go to Hawaii and beat some people up.

18:17.260 --> 18:18.260
Yeah, I mean, it's that simple.

18:18.260 --> 18:19.260
So, wait, can you...

18:19.260 --> 18:22.260
Japan needs to, you know, bomb them again.

18:22.260 --> 18:25.260
Again, for those who don't know Miklotov, he actually works at Konami.

18:25.260 --> 18:28.260
What can you tell us about your job?

18:28.260 --> 18:32.260
He's under a lot of non-disclosure agreements, which means if he says things that he's not supposed to,

18:32.260 --> 18:34.260
he gets a spanking and possibly fire.

18:34.260 --> 18:37.260
He should put a little collar around his neck if he says something he's not supposed to.

18:37.260 --> 18:39.260
That transmits back to the home planet.

18:39.260 --> 18:42.260
So what can you say about your job?

18:42.260 --> 18:44.260
Well, okay, people know I do DDR.

18:44.260 --> 18:49.260
And, um, I mean, if you look at instruction booklets, you see lists of testers and stuff.

18:49.260 --> 18:51.260
And so you see my name there, too.

18:51.260 --> 18:55.260
So, I mean, you can gather that I test and I do DDR and I do other things.

18:55.260 --> 18:59.260
So would it be fair to say, and feel free to say you can't answer if you can't?

18:59.260 --> 19:00.260
I can't answer that what?

19:00.260 --> 19:02.260
I didn't even ask!

19:02.260 --> 19:04.260
Is DDR the only game you work on?

19:04.260 --> 19:06.260
No. No, it's not.

19:06.260 --> 19:09.420
Okay. Do you work on games other than Bomani Games?

19:09.420 --> 19:13.940
Yes. Okay. I see. So the game he's talking about could be anything?

19:13.940 --> 19:17.740
It could be anything, and I hate it so much. Out of curiosity,

19:17.740 --> 19:21.420
are there any songs you've been hearing a lot at work lately?

19:21.420 --> 19:24.740
Any songs stuck in your head that you've been hearing an awful lot at work?

19:24.740 --> 19:28.740
Yeah, the Hum a Few Bars.

19:28.740 --> 19:32.940
No. Any songs from any, like, purple looking games

19:32.940 --> 19:35.940
that you can think of? Oh, you're talking about Beatmania, aren't you?

19:35.940 --> 19:41.500
Okay, hold on. I can clear this up. You know about Beatmania? We don't know anything more

19:41.500 --> 19:45.300
than everybody else does. When we saw those pictures for the first time, is when you saw

19:45.300 --> 19:49.300
those pictures for the first time. So it was shocking to us to think.

19:49.300 --> 19:54.060
But IGN saw them before everybody saw them. I know, they're jerks.

19:54.060 --> 19:58.660
He hate IGN. What's up? Can you tell me about this? What

19:58.660 --> 20:02.900
the hell is up with GamePro? What the hell? How come they beat you to everything?

20:02.900 --> 20:09.000
They're a nobody pays attention to magazine so they can say whatever they want.

20:09.000 --> 20:12.840
They need to say something to get some readers, and they have readers for a day.

20:12.840 --> 20:16.960
Disclaimer guys, Miklotov's comments are his own and do not necessarily reflect those economics.

20:16.960 --> 20:20.280
They are one of the EGM, okay?

20:20.280 --> 20:25.120
GamePro used to be the shit back in the day when it was GamePro and Nintendo Power.

20:25.120 --> 20:28.160
You know what, you bastards, I used to subscribe to GamePro.

20:28.160 --> 20:29.160
So did I.

20:29.160 --> 20:37.160
I was in their little elite club thing that they had for a short while, where there was only like several hundred members because I wrote like a thing in the contest and I won.

20:37.160 --> 20:45.160
Yeah, every day they would walk in, see the big list of the club members and go, HA HA HA HA HA! STUPID PEOPLE! HA HA HA HA!

20:45.160 --> 20:54.160
See, the only thing I remember from GamePro from my childhood is the two covers, the American Gladiators one, and the Gremlins 2 one, and then everything else is a blur.

20:54.160 --> 20:56.160
Because the American Gladiators one.

20:56.160 --> 20:59.060
There's one.

20:59.060 --> 21:00.060
What's that noise?

21:00.060 --> 21:01.060
Forget it.

21:01.060 --> 21:02.060
Forget it.

21:02.060 --> 21:07.560
I can't remember when I pinched my cheek at the end of the cover.

21:07.560 --> 21:08.560
Forget it.

21:08.560 --> 21:09.560
Forget it.

21:09.560 --> 21:10.560
It's...

21:10.560 --> 21:11.560
Rob was right as you say that.

21:11.560 --> 21:13.560
He was masturbating to the cover.

21:13.560 --> 21:14.560
Yeah.

21:14.560 --> 21:15.560
When I was nine.

21:15.560 --> 21:21.580
This is what we call a radio gag because they can't see that I'm pulling my cheek.

21:21.580 --> 21:24.340
It sounds over the sound waves.

21:24.340 --> 21:25.340
It sounds like...

21:25.340 --> 21:34.340
But see, make it look tough, this is what we do when we don't have sound boards with different audio effects, we have to make them ourselves.

21:34.340 --> 21:40.340
But still, I was like 9 when that cover came out, so if you're like saying that I was masturbating at 9...

21:40.340 --> 21:42.340
Dude, some people were!

21:42.340 --> 21:45.340
No, people can keep magazines, they don't just disappear.

21:45.340 --> 21:48.340
But it had like, laser on the cover!

21:48.340 --> 21:50.340
I didn't even remember who was on the cover!

21:50.340 --> 21:53.340
It was Gemini, Laser, and some chick.

21:53.340 --> 21:55.340
Okay!

21:55.340 --> 22:00.340
Those Farrah Fawcett posters were in guys' bedrooms for like 25 years.

22:00.340 --> 22:01.340
Okay.

22:01.340 --> 22:02.340
They need lives, then.

22:02.340 --> 22:03.340
I guess so.

22:03.340 --> 22:06.340
And, Loki, what are you talking about that we don't have a soundboard here at the station?

22:06.340 --> 22:07.340
God.

22:07.340 --> 22:08.340
God.

22:08.340 --> 22:09.340
Damn.

22:09.340 --> 22:10.340
Ow, my foot!

22:10.340 --> 22:13.340
Why did I shoot myself in my foot?

22:13.340 --> 22:17.340
Oh, I have something else.

22:17.340 --> 22:18.340
What?

22:18.340 --> 22:19.340
Okay, I had to drink.

22:19.340 --> 22:27.340
We were at IHOP today, and we were sitting in the back of the place, because that's where they made us sit.

22:27.340 --> 22:30.340
And so we're having our normal discussions.

22:30.340 --> 22:33.340
X, to Fur, has his little rainbow shirt on.

22:33.340 --> 22:36.340
And Justin, I don't know, did you say Jazz or Jazz?

22:36.340 --> 22:38.340
Justin, okay.

22:38.340 --> 22:39.340
Sorry, my bad.

22:39.340 --> 22:42.340
Because people know you as Jazz online, if anything.

22:42.340 --> 22:47.340
Because you're famous, you contributed a story to DDR Freak this week, so you're to famous.

22:47.340 --> 23:02.340
He has a shirt on that says homosexuals are gay, and so we have this big gay group over here and we're talking, and this old lady comes over, and she's like, so they stick all the gay people in the back of the place, or something like that. I wasn't paying attention because I was laughing.

23:02.340 --> 23:05.340
Implying that she and her friends were all lesbians. Old lesbians.

23:05.340 --> 23:08.340
Yeah, because they were old and girls, and I guess that means they're lesbians.

23:08.340 --> 23:10.340
So you don't hide the fact you're queer?

23:10.340 --> 23:11.340
No.

23:11.340 --> 23:12.340
Oh, okay. Just curious.

23:12.340 --> 23:14.340
Some of our listeners may not know.

23:14.340 --> 23:18.340
Oh my god. It's gonna be their live journal post from now on.

23:18.340 --> 23:20.340
I know, I'm gonna go angst about it later.

23:22.340 --> 23:25.340
That guy on that radio show said he was gay, bah.

23:25.340 --> 23:26.340
Oh no.

23:26.340 --> 23:29.340
You know, come to think of it, we have an interesting setup tonight because-

23:29.340 --> 23:32.340
I know, I was just like, oh wait a second.

23:32.340 --> 23:38.340
Loki's sitting in the center of the room, and he's surrounded by a bunch of bags.

23:38.340 --> 23:40.340
Eh, I'm used to it.

23:40.340 --> 23:44.400
what do you mean you're used to it what do you mean you're used to it

23:44.400 --> 23:48.120
what the hell we shared an apartment for like two years so come on

23:48.120 --> 23:49.720
so when rob had his orgies

23:49.720 --> 23:55.080
hey i never had orgies

23:55.080 --> 23:57.540
that was the best spot to see the tv

23:57.540 --> 24:03.920
loki hold on hold on to this biscuit loki close your eyes

24:03.920 --> 24:07.860
anyway moving on anything else you want to share about your week

24:07.860 --> 24:09.460
Okay, you can go back to Meteos now.

24:09.460 --> 24:10.360
Hooray!

24:10.360 --> 24:12.160
Wait, this is the first time you've played Meteos.

24:12.160 --> 24:14.060
Yeah, really, this is pretty much the first time I've played it.

24:14.060 --> 24:15.160
Pretty cool, huh?

24:15.160 --> 24:15.660
What'd I tell you?

24:15.660 --> 24:17.660
I hate it, because there's nothing really to do in it,

24:17.660 --> 24:19.860
but then I just gotta keep moving the stylus,

24:19.860 --> 24:23.260
and make blocks fly up, but they fall back down!

24:23.260 --> 24:25.860
So, this makes me think of a question.

24:25.860 --> 24:27.960
At Konami, like, are you allowed to play?

24:27.960 --> 24:29.660
Because, you know, you get your breaks and lunch.

24:29.660 --> 24:31.560
I'm assuming they don't slave drive you guys too much.

24:31.560 --> 24:33.460
You actually get a break and a lunch, you know.

24:33.460 --> 24:35.460
Oh, yeah, we play whatever we want.

24:35.460 --> 24:36.460
I play Pump It Up there.

24:36.460 --> 24:40.540
So I was going to ask, can you play whatever you want on your breaks?

24:40.540 --> 24:45.220
Oh, it was funny, because I was playing Pump It Up, and I was talking to somebody that

24:45.220 --> 24:48.620
was a little higher up than me, and I was saying how much I like Pump It Up more than

24:48.620 --> 24:53.980
DDR, and then the higher up for all of us came in, and he told him, and I had to explain

24:53.980 --> 24:54.980
myself.

24:54.980 --> 24:55.980
It was great.

24:55.980 --> 24:57.860
But yeah, I play Pump there.

24:57.860 --> 25:02.340
That's pretty much all I do on breaks.

25:02.340 --> 25:03.340
That's great.

25:03.340 --> 25:07.340
There are a lot of other hot games in the office right now that are not Konami made.

25:07.340 --> 25:10.340
Dr. Mario for Nintendo 64?

25:10.340 --> 25:16.340
Kind of random. I didn't even know they made Dr. Mario for Nintendo 64.

25:16.340 --> 25:20.340
I remember Pokemon Puzzle League, but I don't remember Dr. Mario 64.

25:20.340 --> 25:22.340
Like Dr. Mario in Tetris or something?

25:22.340 --> 25:24.340
I don't know. That's right.

25:24.340 --> 25:28.340
I'm not sure. That, Pump It Up, and Forza Motorsport.

25:28.340 --> 25:31.340
That's the ones that get played that aren't Konami games.

25:31.340 --> 25:33.100
An enthusiast?

25:33.100 --> 25:35.800
Forza Motorsport is what we play there.

25:35.800 --> 25:40.300
Nothing else.

25:40.300 --> 25:45.100
Oh, and on a... I have to ask, maybe you can't tell me because this is a Konami-related game, but

25:45.100 --> 25:47.180
how's the Winx game turning out?

25:47.180 --> 25:48.620
NDA.

25:48.620 --> 25:50.660
Damn you.

25:50.660 --> 25:55.540
You can't tell me shit about DDR, now you can't tell me shit about the Winx? Winx Club has now been...

25:55.540 --> 25:58.540
It's been relabeled as adult only, so, you know.

25:58.540 --> 26:01.540
Yes! I mean, dude, the Winx get topless!

26:03.540 --> 26:05.540
The Winx Hot Coffee Edition.

26:06.540 --> 26:09.540
Honestly, it wouldn't surprise me, but that's all I'll say.

26:09.540 --> 26:11.540
Whoa, hey. Alright, moving on.

26:11.540 --> 26:13.540
That's what the franchise needs.

26:13.540 --> 26:17.540
Um, let's go over to, uh, Justin. How was your week? How was your day, sir?

26:17.540 --> 26:20.540
My week was pretty uneventful, uh...

26:20.540 --> 26:23.540
I did... I played Final Fantasy for most of the week,

26:23.540 --> 26:31.540
And when I wasn't playing Final Fantasy, I was starting up school again, which kind of sucks, but eh, it's something to do, so that's good enough for me.

26:31.540 --> 26:39.540
Then on Saturday morning, I drove up here, and we hung out, and we went to IHOP, and that was funny with the lesbians.

26:39.540 --> 26:44.540
Because they specifically told me that it was because of my shirt they could tell we were all gay.

26:44.540 --> 26:47.540
Yeah, your shirt made us all gay.

26:47.540 --> 26:49.540
Yeah, it's great. I love it.

26:49.540 --> 26:53.140
Yeah, because gays aren't allowed to associate with straights in public, only behind closed

26:53.140 --> 26:54.140
doors, apparently.

26:54.140 --> 26:55.140
Yes, indeed.

26:55.140 --> 26:56.140
Yeah.

26:56.140 --> 26:58.180
Besides that, that's about it.

26:58.180 --> 26:59.180
All right.

26:59.180 --> 27:00.180
Yep.

27:00.180 --> 27:01.180
Exciting.

27:01.180 --> 27:05.300
Extra for anything you want to share?

27:05.300 --> 27:08.780
My week was really cool, I guess.

27:08.780 --> 27:12.900
I don't know, I watched a lot of South Park.

27:12.900 --> 27:16.020
I went to work, I slept.

27:16.020 --> 27:19.060
It was very uneventful, but it was good.

27:19.060 --> 27:24.060
Ironically, the boring weeks become, you know, the better weeks sometimes, you know.

27:24.060 --> 27:28.060
Okay, I have a small little thing to add on to what Christopher just said.

27:28.060 --> 27:29.060
Yeah.

27:29.060 --> 27:38.060
Now, don't ask me why I was watching UPN, but for some reason UPN was on the TV, and apparently UPN is getting South Park now.

27:38.060 --> 27:42.060
And I'm like, what the hell would you want to watch South Park on UPN for?

27:42.060 --> 27:43.060
Wow.

27:43.060 --> 27:44.060
You wouldn't.

27:44.060 --> 27:45.060
Exactly!

27:45.060 --> 27:47.060
Wow.

27:47.060 --> 27:54.280
Christopher what else did you watch that rhymes with the 4400? Um, I don't know. Maybe you can tell me the 44

27:54.280 --> 27:59.320
Oh, yeah, that rhymes with 44. It's an awesome show. I'm sorry. I forgot to add that to mine and

27:59.840 --> 28:02.320
Shainer miklotov bought me

28:02.840 --> 28:04.340
You can call him Shane. That's all right

28:04.340 --> 28:06.900
Oh Shane Shane by the way, but me fine

28:06.900 --> 28:11.320
The listeners will just have to draw a chart at home to keep track of okay

28:11.320 --> 28:14.160
Here's their online name and here's their real name. So, okay

28:14.680 --> 28:15.840
and

28:15.840 --> 28:18.280
And he got me into Final Fantasy XI.

28:18.280 --> 28:21.080
Hooray, I converted somebody.

28:21.080 --> 28:22.080
So yeah.

28:22.080 --> 28:23.080
Yeah, I helped.

28:23.080 --> 28:26.840
Oh yeah, and I made Shane watch Mean Girls for the first time, and he loved it.

28:26.840 --> 28:28.600
It's an awesome movie!

28:28.600 --> 28:31.960
It's really, really funny.

28:31.960 --> 28:34.640
And today has been cool.

28:34.640 --> 28:35.640
That's good.

28:35.640 --> 28:37.840
I'm glad you're having a cool day.

28:37.840 --> 28:41.480
Alright, um, my week and my day.

28:41.480 --> 28:44.260
Actually, I had a pretty shitty week, because I've been sick all week.

28:44.260 --> 28:47.420
didn't you can probably hear it now a little bit like I know my voice is

28:47.420 --> 28:51.340
usually kind of nasal but especially so tonight because I've I had a sinus

28:51.340 --> 28:56.900
infection this week so it was pretty bad weird enough I'm pretty confident that I

28:56.900 --> 29:02.580
caught it on my plane ride back from the East Coast but it the symptoms didn't

29:02.580 --> 29:08.540
really set in until Tuesday or Monday night what did you say West Nile it's not

29:08.540 --> 29:23.540
It's coming back on the plane.

29:23.540 --> 29:27.540
Yeah, it's coming back on the plane. I was pretty sure I caught my sinus infection there.

29:27.540 --> 29:31.540
I did not get bit by a mosquito on the plane. They don't let mosquitoes in planes.

29:31.540 --> 29:33.540
Stay up on the terrace!

30:01.540 --> 30:03.780
This is reaching for a microphone, yes?

30:03.780 --> 30:05.300
You can still call in sick.

30:05.300 --> 30:07.300
There's so many people that can work for you.

30:07.300 --> 30:09.160
You're just scared of it.

30:09.160 --> 30:10.160
But it's kind of one of those things...

30:10.160 --> 30:12.160
Yeah, you're scared.

30:12.160 --> 30:13.160
I don't want to...

30:13.160 --> 30:15.160
I'm not supposed to talk about my job outside my job, but...

30:15.160 --> 30:17.160
Anyway, so how was your day?

30:17.160 --> 30:18.740
Shut up.

30:18.740 --> 30:23.080
It's one of those things where if I don't do it myself, I don't know how things are

30:23.080 --> 30:26.600
going to be when I get back, and I might be creating more work for myself by calling in

30:26.600 --> 30:27.600
sick.

30:27.600 --> 30:28.600
See what I'm saying?

30:28.600 --> 30:30.600
See what I'm saying?

30:30.600 --> 30:31.600
Take care of yourself first.

30:31.600 --> 30:32.600
Whatever.

30:32.600 --> 30:33.600
I took care of myself.

30:33.600 --> 30:34.600
I slept all night.

30:34.600 --> 30:35.600
It doesn't matter when you're sick.

30:35.600 --> 30:36.600
That's why I have nothing to say about my week because I slept.

30:36.600 --> 30:41.520
But I have to admit, I have to admit when I go home and I see you, like, in any, uh,

30:41.520 --> 30:46.800
you know, any pose, like, sleeping on the couch is fucking hilarious, because you look

30:46.800 --> 30:48.940
funny when you sleep and you're sick.

30:48.940 --> 30:52.500
Rob would also like to add that he will have something to talk about next week because

30:52.500 --> 30:54.120
he has Hello Kitty Roller Rescue.

30:54.120 --> 30:55.120
I did.

30:55.120 --> 30:59.640
Loki bought me a copy, or didn't buy me, but obtained me a copy through his work, not through

30:59.640 --> 31:03.240
I've been pirating, actually, but through his work, obtained me a copy of Hello Kitty

31:03.240 --> 31:07.320
Roller Rescue, so I'm really excited, and have a reason to dust off the GameCube, since

31:07.320 --> 31:10.400
otherwise the damn thing wouldn't be getting dusted off until 2006.

31:10.400 --> 31:16.640
Yeah, because my work looked at me funny when I was excited to get Hello Kitty Roller Rescue.

31:16.640 --> 31:20.520
I'm all, yeah, I'm all, yeah, my friend's gonna love this game, they're all, right,

31:20.520 --> 31:26.680
your friend.

31:26.680 --> 31:27.680
That's great.

31:27.680 --> 31:31.360
So I didn't sick all week, so I didn't have a chance to do a lot until the weekend.

31:31.360 --> 31:34.320
Now yesterday we took an adventure over to Fry's Electronics, which is the big

31:34.320 --> 31:35.340
electronics store in town,

31:35.340 --> 31:38.740
and I finally picked up a US PlayStation 2

31:38.740 --> 31:42.100
finally after all this time because I didn't need one for a long time. I had a

31:42.100 --> 31:45.940
Japanese PlayStation 2, so I was able to get my, you know, BeatMania 2DX and

31:45.940 --> 31:49.620
DDR fix through the Japanese PlayStation, but I was really missing out on

31:49.620 --> 31:53.620
everything else. But since I was living with Loki for the past couple years

31:53.620 --> 31:59.580
up until April, I was able to abuse his US PlayStation 2, so I never had to buy one.

31:59.580 --> 32:03.500
But now that, you know, Extafur isn't quite the gamer I am.

32:03.500 --> 32:05.180
Extafur, do you have any game systems?

32:05.180 --> 32:06.180
What do you?

32:06.180 --> 32:12.620
I have a GameCube that I love, and, um, that I never play either, and...

32:12.620 --> 32:15.500
So we let you on the show because you are a gamer, believe it or not.

32:15.500 --> 32:18.260
I have played a video game before.

32:18.260 --> 32:19.780
Okay, that's good.

32:19.780 --> 32:21.860
What are your favorite GameCube games?

32:21.860 --> 32:24.860
Um, Netroid Prime...

32:24.860 --> 32:26.860
There you go! Alright.

32:26.860 --> 32:30.860
Now what did I tell you to say every time somebody brings up Final Fantasy XI?

32:30.860 --> 32:33.860
Damn those gills-sells.

32:33.860 --> 32:36.860
Gill-sellers. There you go.

32:36.860 --> 32:39.860
Them gills-sells, they sell gills all the time.

32:39.860 --> 32:42.860
What's a gills-seller?

32:44.860 --> 32:49.860
It's one of the people that sells the currency on eBay and fucks up the economy.

32:49.860 --> 32:51.860
Oh, well damn them.

32:51.860 --> 32:53.860
There you go.

32:53.860 --> 32:55.860
So you just have a GameCube, nothing else?

32:55.860 --> 32:57.860
I have a GameCube and a Game Boy Advance.

32:57.860 --> 33:02.860
And I have PlayStation 2 games and I don't have a PlayStation 2.

33:02.860 --> 33:03.860
But you have one, so hey.

33:03.860 --> 33:04.860
I have one now?

33:04.860 --> 33:05.860
You have a tiny one.

33:05.860 --> 33:07.860
Yes, I bought one of the new minis.

33:07.860 --> 33:09.860
I was going to...go ahead.

33:09.860 --> 33:10.860
No, no, go ahead.

33:10.860 --> 33:15.860
I was going to get an old style PlayStation 2, but they're kind of hard to find now.

33:15.860 --> 33:17.860
It's because I wanted to put a hard drive in it.

33:17.860 --> 33:23.020
I just decided you know fuck it most PlayStation 2 games like 20 bucks now, and there's only a few. I want to play it in your

33:23.020 --> 33:24.060
pocket

33:24.060 --> 33:28.260
You can still have a hard drive in the mini ones how they have not in it

33:28.620 --> 33:30.420
Unless it's USB advanced

33:30.420 --> 33:34.620
It's a you can use the USB hard drive supports up to terabyte hard drives

33:34.620 --> 33:41.220
And you can it'll run just as fast as running off the CD-ROM not quite faster, but as fast so

33:41.780 --> 33:45.060
It is possible you load it on memory card really

33:45.060 --> 33:49.060
But I only have to pay like $400 for its terabyte USB.

33:49.060 --> 33:55.060
Well, you're not going to buy a terabyte drive. You can get like, you know, a smaller drive, you know, for a lot less.

33:55.060 --> 33:57.060
That's true because you can always swap them in and off the computer.

33:57.060 --> 34:03.060
Or you can get one of the enclosures where you can buy just, you know, put any hard drive in there and make it a USB 2.0 drive.

34:03.060 --> 34:09.060
Now, too bad you didn't wait, though, because it's dropping down in price to $99.

34:09.060 --> 34:10.060
But not until November.

34:10.060 --> 34:11.060
Yeah.

34:11.060 --> 34:13.060
To compete with Xbox 360. I saved my receipt just in case.

34:13.060 --> 34:19.060
Hey Rob, those PlayStation 2's aren't new anymore.

34:19.060 --> 34:23.060
They're new to me because nobody I know has one, except me.

34:23.060 --> 34:25.060
But they're still not new.

34:25.060 --> 34:28.060
They're new to me. I don't care if they're not.

34:28.060 --> 34:34.060
Hey, and Xbox 360 is cool because it's going to have Final Fantasy XI, that's why I'm getting it.

34:34.060 --> 34:35.060
Which one are you getting?

34:35.060 --> 34:39.060
I'm getting the one that's worth the money, not the one that's a $300 doorstop.

34:39.060 --> 34:43.060
I love how you come on this program to promote non-Konami games.

34:43.060 --> 34:47.060
Yeah, like Pump.

34:47.060 --> 34:51.060
We'll get to your Pump story, don't worry.

34:51.060 --> 34:55.060
So, I bought my US PlayStation 2,

34:55.060 --> 34:59.060
and I bought two games when I bought it. I bought Katamari Damacy, because

34:59.060 --> 35:03.060
that's a must-own game now, and Final Fantasy X, because

35:03.060 --> 35:07.060
the whole reason I bought one is because I had an urge to go back and play Final Fantasy X.

35:07.060 --> 35:10.060
I don't care what you people say, Valve HD 10 was great.

35:10.060 --> 35:12.060
I have to bring you back, uh...

35:12.060 --> 35:13.060
DDR Extreme?

35:13.060 --> 35:14.060
DDR Extreme.

35:14.060 --> 35:16.060
Uh, maybe DDR Extreme.

35:16.060 --> 35:21.060
Um, no, actually, the DDR Extreme, um, that's being loaned out to someone. I gotta get that back.

35:21.060 --> 35:24.060
I have your Max 2 or Max, I think.

35:24.060 --> 35:25.060
Cool.

35:25.060 --> 35:26.060
One of them.

35:26.060 --> 35:27.060
Cool.

35:27.060 --> 35:28.060
Very cool.

35:29.060 --> 35:35.060
So I can play some DDR at home, which I haven't done in probably, you know, a long time.

35:35.060 --> 35:45.060
No, I do sometimes, but actually pulling out the dance pad and playing is kind of a chore, especially when we live upstairs. But luckily the downstairs neighbors are kind of cool.

35:45.060 --> 35:55.060
Speaking about the downstairs neighbors, are there any British soccer player games that we can talk about? Because they're downstairs right now, I just saw them outside. Anyways, I have to go see them again.

35:55.060 --> 35:56.060
We're going to see them again.

35:56.060 --> 35:59.060
Winning 11, you can talk about winning 11.

35:59.060 --> 36:01.060
We can talk about winning 11, I don't know.

36:01.060 --> 36:03.060
Alright, go have fun, Extover.

36:05.060 --> 36:10.060
Alright, anyway, I guess what we'll do now, why don't we go to a quick break?

36:10.060 --> 36:12.060
Then we're going to come back and talk about some actual Bomani news.

36:12.060 --> 36:14.060
Things that are going on in the Bomani world.

36:14.060 --> 36:16.060
Yes, let's.

36:16.060 --> 36:19.060
Let's. And then we'll also open up the Skype line a little later on in the show.

36:19.060 --> 36:32.060
So you guys, if you have anything you want to ask Miklotov or us, you can, because I'm sure folks are going to try and get some information on Miklotov even though he ain't going to tell you anything, but you can try.

36:32.060 --> 36:44.060
So we'll open up the skype line for you guys a little later on. So if you guys want to be able to call on the show, you have to head on over to our skype line, www.orangeloungeradio.com and click on interact with us.

36:44.060 --> 36:50.060
And meanwhile, we'll do some more announced music for DDR Extreme 2.

36:50.060 --> 36:57.060
started off with a little bit of Boom Boom Dollar. We'll be back after this.

38:20.060 --> 38:21.160
Go, go, go.

38:21.160 --> 38:23.120
Allez, allez, allez.

38:23.120 --> 38:24.100
Allez, allez, allez.

38:24.100 --> 38:28.560
Go, go, go, go.

38:28.560 --> 38:30.280
Go, go, go, go.

38:30.280 --> 38:31.240
Go, go, go, go.

38:31.240 --> 38:31.740
Go!

38:39.200 --> 38:41.180
This is not the life.

38:41.180 --> 38:43.160
This is the world.

38:43.160 --> 38:44.580
No, it's the time.

38:44.580 --> 38:46.740
Don't ever stop.

38:46.740 --> 38:52.740
We should have known, got up strong We should have known, back to the top

38:52.740 --> 38:59.740
Como que hic lave, eso pasido que En es que espeñar por una se ya

39:58.740 --> 40:08.740
Ooh, better in the decision for the poor, poor poor

40:08.740 --> 40:10.740
Oh

40:38.740 --> 40:43.740
Yeah, baby, this is what I want to do

40:43.740 --> 40:47.740
The

40:47.740 --> 40:51.740
no

40:51.740 --> 40:55.740
no

40:55.740 --> 40:59.740
no

40:59.740 --> 41:03.740
no

41:03.740 --> 41:07.740
no

41:07.740 --> 41:11.740
no

41:11.740 --> 41:26.740
Clean up the night, clean up the night Clean up the night, clean up the night

41:26.740 --> 41:34.740
Why did our feelings die action When we fought satisfaction

41:34.740 --> 41:39.740
But our hearts and as always, save me

41:39.740 --> 41:41.740
Why?

41:41.740 --> 41:44.740
Little love, all this magic

41:44.740 --> 41:48.740
Isn't you a kind of tragic?

41:48.740 --> 41:52.740
We were here for the best

41:52.740 --> 41:56.740
In the heat of the night

41:56.740 --> 42:00.740
Marching close to the fire

42:00.740 --> 42:03.740
And the power of our hearts

42:03.740 --> 42:06.740
The minute we dive inside

42:07.740 --> 42:09.740
In the heat of the night

42:10.740 --> 42:13.740
Much is lost through the fire

42:14.740 --> 42:16.740
And the power of our hearts

42:17.740 --> 42:20.740
The minute we dive inside

42:21.740 --> 42:23.740
In the heat of the night

42:23.740 --> 42:37.740
It's the heat of the night, the night, the night

42:37.740 --> 42:43.740
In the heat of the night, the night, the night

42:43.740 --> 42:46.740
From the steps why the orange flag

42:46.740 --> 42:49.740
This media stops

42:49.740 --> 43:07.060
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 154 in progress.

43:07.060 --> 43:09.180
We were talking a little bit about our weeks and our days.

43:09.180 --> 43:11.980
Now we're going to talk a little bit about some things that are going on in the Bumani

43:11.980 --> 43:12.980
world.

43:12.980 --> 43:18.820
I suppose even though we've really just beat this topic into the freaking ground over the

43:18.820 --> 43:25.500
past few episodes, I think we sort of have to kind of say something about the recent

43:25.500 --> 43:28.180
developments in the Konami vs. Roxor case.

43:28.180 --> 43:30.380
Okay, basically, here it is.

43:30.380 --> 43:34.500
I'm just going to give you the short version, then you can say what you want, we'll be done.

43:34.500 --> 43:41.660
DDR Freak kind of used their account into the government public system, I think it's

43:41.660 --> 43:45.780
called PACER or something, to pull the latest documents in the case, because these are all

43:45.780 --> 43:51.780
publicly available documents, it's not, you know, anything that's filed in the court of law, well, almost anything is usually publicly available.

43:51.780 --> 43:57.780
So they basically pulled the official response to Konami's original claims.

43:57.780 --> 44:02.780
Rockstar had responded to those on July 25th, so they went ahead and put those on their site.

44:02.780 --> 44:10.780
Basically, in short, Rockstar says, we deny, we deny, we deny, we request that Konami's patent on DDR be invalidated.

44:10.780 --> 44:14.780
And that's part of a countersuit, which Rockstar went ahead with doing a countersuit there.

44:14.780 --> 44:21.420
And then Konami responded on August 15th, nothing really earth shaking there, just basically

44:21.420 --> 44:26.180
deny, deny, deny, you know, we'll see you in court type thing.

44:26.180 --> 44:30.720
Also posted something called an order for discovery, kind of the most interesting thing

44:30.720 --> 44:35.860
in there I think as it was because I don't profess to be a lawyer, so I'm not going to

44:35.860 --> 44:39.020
try and make sense of these documents.

44:39.020 --> 44:44.240
But the order for discovery has like a timetable of what a possible trial would look like.

44:44.240 --> 44:59.240
A trial date would be February of 2007, so this Konami vs. Rockzor bitching would go on well through, like, Extreme 4 and In the Groove 4, so we're screwed either way.

44:59.240 --> 45:07.240
If you want to check this out for yourself, www.ddrfreak.com, you can check out the original documents posted there.

45:07.240 --> 45:11.560
Loki? Did you check this out? Yeah, briefly.

45:11.560 --> 45:15.040
Yeah, it's like, eh, whatever. Yeah. Please

45:15.040 --> 45:19.500
make it so Konami can't use their patents so we can steal it!

45:19.500 --> 45:22.760
Hey, you know what? In the group, guess what?

45:22.760 --> 45:27.080
Rockzor? There's some modifiers that you don't have yet that are in, uh, Pump It Up.

45:27.080 --> 45:28.500
Go steal those now.

45:28.500 --> 45:33.040
I would, though, would it be stealing, though? Because now they're

45:33.040 --> 45:35.440
working with Andamir, which I think would be really

45:35.440 --> 45:40.440
It would be funny if those two companies end up merging before 2007.

45:40.440 --> 45:44.440
Shut up right now. Don't say such horrible things.

45:44.440 --> 45:48.440
If those two companies end up merging before 2007, how is that going to screw everything up?

45:48.440 --> 45:57.440
There's a little difference here. I mean, because watching you guys play Pump It Up, you know, today versus watching In The Groove, it's like night and day.

45:57.440 --> 46:04.440
I mean, come on. The videos in Pump It Up, phenomenal. The videos in In The Groove, uh...

46:04.440 --> 46:06.440
There's videos in In the Groove? No.

46:06.440 --> 46:08.440
Yeah, it's just some random crap.

46:08.440 --> 46:10.440
Um, the...

46:10.440 --> 46:13.440
Just the whole step charts, you know, that's...

46:13.440 --> 46:20.440
You know, granted, Pump It Up has some really retarded ones, like 17 difficulty stuff.

46:20.440 --> 46:22.440
Which, you know, In the Groove, you know, they're falling behind here.

46:22.440 --> 46:24.440
I mean, they're a little ahead of you.

46:24.440 --> 46:26.440
So, um...

46:26.440 --> 46:27.440
I don't know.

46:27.440 --> 46:32.440
To be honest, it's gonna take them In the Groove 4 before this game's even...

46:32.440 --> 46:41.440
I mean, that's why I think. I'd like to see something innovative happen. Haven't seen it yet with In the Groove 2.

46:41.440 --> 46:44.440
Waiting for In the Groove 3, when it might be good.

46:44.440 --> 46:50.440
Did you check out us here locally in our town, Sacramento? We got a new In the Groove 2 machine. Have you checked it out yet?

46:50.440 --> 46:55.440
Wow, it's red. And it has more songs. And it's red.

46:55.440 --> 47:10.440
I haven't gone to check it out, but I have a good excuse, because the arcade it's at is right on the same area, or right on the same lot as the state fairgrounds, and the state fair is going on right now, so you can't get a parking space anywhere near the arcade. So, forget it.

47:10.440 --> 47:24.440
I'm not gonna pay $10 to go freaking park in the state fair parking lot and go play In the Groove 2 of all things. I mean, even though I try not to take sides in the whole thing.

47:24.440 --> 47:28.280
I just don't care anymore. I really don't. The game sucks.

47:28.280 --> 47:29.960
That's the way I think, you know.

47:29.960 --> 47:33.160
You love it, good. You like crap. Big deal.

47:33.160 --> 47:36.680
I mean, you know what? There are people that like crap out there. I mean, I like bad

47:36.680 --> 47:37.580
movies.

47:37.580 --> 47:41.760
Some people say, what the hell's wrong with you? But, you know, I like bad movies. I mean, what the hell?

47:41.760 --> 47:43.500
So, if you like, you know,

47:43.500 --> 47:48.000
inferior games, if you think it's fun, hey, good. It's your niche. Obviously, someone's

47:48.000 --> 47:52.880
buying them, so somebody out there likes them. Good.

47:52.880 --> 47:56.160
Miek Latov, now I know you really, really probably can't comment on these,

47:56.160 --> 47:56.680
because

47:56.680 --> 48:00.500
especially in your position, you'd be in a world of hurt, but

48:00.500 --> 48:03.960
is there anything you do want to say? I'm taking off my Konami hat for a second.

48:03.960 --> 48:08.280
Okay. Okay. In the Groove is stupid. When I read the

48:08.280 --> 48:12.280
the countersuit, I thought, you know, wow, you know, Rockstar's really taking a

48:12.280 --> 48:14.720
chance with four-year-old lawyers.

48:14.720 --> 48:19.360
Actually, apparently, now wait a minute, apparently now in the

48:19.360 --> 48:25.260
a little blurb that was written up a little article on DDR Freak by a law student or somebody

48:25.260 --> 48:28.500
that has a degree in law. I don't remember the specific scenario, but you can go read

48:28.500 --> 48:29.500
it on DDR Freak.

48:29.500 --> 48:30.500
I once went to a trial.

48:30.500 --> 48:31.500
No, it's not that.

48:31.500 --> 48:35.080
Hey, I watch a lot of Law and Order. I know this.

48:35.080 --> 48:39.320
The guy, actually, he's a good writer. I'm not going to knock him. It was a good article.

48:39.320 --> 48:44.520
But he says in the article that the Roxor legal team is actually a pretty well-respected

48:44.520 --> 48:47.000
group from the Bay Area.

48:47.000 --> 48:52.560
in the park, you know, in the little sandbox, when they have their little shovels and tails.

48:52.560 --> 48:59.760
Um, no, I'm sorry, everything Loki said is how I feel. It's inferior, and Roxor's just

48:59.760 --> 49:03.080
whiny because they want money off somebody else's game.

49:03.080 --> 49:07.480
Well now, now wait a minute though, here's... I promised myself I wouldn't get into another

49:07.480 --> 49:14.160
lawsuit discussion, but I don't care. I have you here, so... Okay. Roxor, you can look

49:14.160 --> 49:19.980
at us like the big corporate evil people that just want money, but think about the people

49:19.980 --> 49:25.020
that actually made In The Groove, the team that actually made it before it got absolved

49:25.020 --> 49:30.540
into RockSore. These guys were DDR fans that just took their obsession to a really extreme

49:30.540 --> 49:35.880
level. Yeah, and you know what, they could have kept it, you know, kind of on the downlow

49:35.880 --> 49:41.480
and small and not distributed and sold it for money and tried to say, oh it's better

49:41.480 --> 49:47.480
and, oh, we're so cool, we have somebody that uses different aliases also, and all the songs sound the same.

49:47.480 --> 49:53.480
You know, good or bad, okay, good or bad, whether whatever you think of in the group, let's put it this way.

49:53.480 --> 50:00.480
DDR, okay? If they were still making, you know, more mixes for the arcade, this would not have even been made.

50:00.480 --> 50:10.480
And this game itself is so... I don't even know how they're saying that this is not even, you know, copyright on Dance's Revolution.

50:10.480 --> 50:17.280
Honestly, they changed everything, or what they thought they needed to change, so they wouldn't get sued.

50:17.280 --> 50:22.380
That is all. Otherwise, it is an exact duplicate of DDR.

50:22.380 --> 50:27.580
Yeah, and what makes it better is, oh, In the Groove 2 has DDR songs.

50:27.580 --> 50:31.880
You know what's going to be interesting? Yeah, I know. I always thought that's very weird.

50:31.880 --> 50:34.580
Why are they trying to copy DDR and go off to those lines?

50:34.580 --> 50:40.080
It's like, hey, we're getting away with this. Now we're just going to put your songs in here too and make quote-unquote better steps.

50:40.080 --> 50:45.580
Here's the interesting thing, though. Imagine this. Whether you're on the in-the-group side or on the DDR side or on the don't-give-a-shit side,

50:45.580 --> 50:53.080
picture this. The jury trial that might happen if they don't settle, might happen in 2007.

50:53.080 --> 51:00.580
They're going to show a jury these two games. This jury will not have a DDR or in-the-group fan on it, no matter what,

51:00.580 --> 51:09.080
because if people consider themselves a fan of that game, the lawyer from the opposing side is going to boot them off the jury, no question.

51:09.080 --> 51:12.240
So there will not be any DDR in the group fans on this jury.

51:12.240 --> 51:14.900
You show somebody who isn't familiar with these dancing games, these two games side

51:14.900 --> 51:15.900
by side.

51:15.900 --> 51:18.580
They'll be like, that's the exact same game.

51:18.580 --> 51:22.620
That's just all, just draw your own conclusions, just picture that.

51:22.620 --> 51:24.380
That's where this could be headed.

51:24.380 --> 51:29.180
That's why I'm kind of surprised that we're not talking settlement yet, but maybe that's

51:29.180 --> 51:30.180
still a few months off.

51:30.180 --> 51:33.260
They've got to whip their dicks out in the legal sense first.

51:33.260 --> 51:40.260
There's some rumblings that's going to kind of change things from not the Konami side.

51:40.260 --> 51:42.260
Oh. I was like, don't say too much.

51:42.260 --> 51:44.260
No, no, no, no. It has nothing to do with Konami.

51:44.260 --> 51:45.260
Okay.

51:45.260 --> 51:50.260
Yeah, if what I've heard goes through, I don't even know what's going to happen after that.

51:50.260 --> 51:51.260
Interesting.

51:51.260 --> 51:52.260
Yeah.

51:52.260 --> 51:54.260
Very interesting. Okay.

51:54.260 --> 51:58.260
And I don't want it to go through. At all.

51:58.260 --> 51:59.260
Bye.

51:59.260 --> 52:00.260
Oh, I think I know what you're talking about.

52:00.260 --> 52:01.260
Yeah.

52:01.260 --> 52:02.260
Can I say it?

52:02.260 --> 52:07.260
I mean, I just heard it randomly from a respected source, so...

52:07.260 --> 52:11.260
Everybody said this, the rumors that Andamiro is going to buy Rockstar.

52:11.260 --> 52:17.260
Yeah, and that will make me very angry, because I'll be very angry.

52:17.260 --> 52:20.260
That rumor's been going around ever since Andamiro published.

52:20.260 --> 52:24.260
Well, you know, I would rather see Andamiro take on, you know, in the groove

52:24.260 --> 52:27.260
and actually be able to develop, because obviously it looks like their programmers

52:27.260 --> 52:30.260
and game designers know what the fuck they're doing versus these guys.

52:30.260 --> 52:36.260
I mean, these guys may have taken an okay direction, but Andamiro is going to be the one that's going to put the polish on things.

52:36.260 --> 52:45.260
But the weird thing, if Andamiro were to absolve Roxor or whatever, Andamiro and Konami kind of have that agreement where...

52:45.260 --> 52:47.260
They pay money to put out games.

52:47.260 --> 52:51.260
Yeah, the games can coexist. They basically have that, these games can coexist agreement, whatever that may be.

52:51.260 --> 52:53.260
That's why it's going to be weird.

52:53.260 --> 53:00.260
Well, you know, it's weird, but hey, if they want to, you know, draw a truce or whatever, I'm fine with it.

53:00.260 --> 53:06.260
You know, a little healthy competition never hurt anybody because it'd be an easy win for DDR, but, you know.

53:06.260 --> 53:09.260
So you're okay with In the Groove being out there and making new mixes?

53:09.260 --> 53:13.260
I'm fine with it being out there. If I don't like the game, I don't play it. That's pretty simple.

53:13.260 --> 53:18.260
I mean, it's not like I'm forced to play it when I walk into an arcade, so, you know what?

53:18.260 --> 53:25.260
You know what? I've played worse. I've played worse games out there. Hell, I've played a lot of dancing games that have just...

53:25.260 --> 53:30.260
I've played that one game that was like Eye Toy Groove, okay? That was an arcade game. I mean, that game...

53:30.260 --> 53:32.260
Eye Can Dance? Or Eye Can Boogie?

53:32.260 --> 53:39.260
Eye Can Boogie. That game sucks ass, okay? This is in a whole new dimension of crap, okay?

53:39.260 --> 53:42.260
That In The Groove would never, ever be able to touch.

53:42.260 --> 53:47.500
And I've played Dance Station 3DDX, which is really interesting.

53:47.500 --> 53:51.940
You know, that one's a real weird game, but I found it to be pretty fun.

53:51.940 --> 53:53.900
So who cares?

53:53.900 --> 53:55.020
Put another game out there.

53:55.020 --> 53:57.100
Give some people some choice, you know?

53:57.100 --> 54:00.140
All right, all right.

54:00.140 --> 54:04.100
Extrofer, Justin, anything you guys want to say about this whole thing?

54:04.100 --> 54:06.260
Nothing?

54:06.260 --> 54:10.540
Extrofer's like, I don't know what you're talking about.

54:10.540 --> 54:11.660
What do you think, Extrofer?

54:11.660 --> 54:14.660
Well, okay, I'm actually curious of your perspective, but he hasn't really...

54:14.660 --> 54:16.660
Have you seen the In the Groove game at all?

54:16.660 --> 54:17.660
At the bowling alley?

54:17.660 --> 54:19.660
I did see it at the bowling alley, yes.

54:19.660 --> 54:23.660
Okay, now you're someone who doesn't play dance games really an awful lot.

54:23.660 --> 54:26.660
Like maybe we made you get up there once or twice, but you don't really play the dance games.

54:26.660 --> 54:31.660
Well, you know, I play when I go back home to, you know, where I grew up.

54:31.660 --> 54:32.660
Right.

54:32.660 --> 54:34.660
And my sister plays DDR.

54:34.660 --> 54:40.660
Okay, so I'm curious, as somebody who is not a hardcore fan of these two games, what do you think?

54:40.660 --> 54:45.360
think? Is one game a rip-off of the other?

54:45.360 --> 54:52.500
I think that In the Groove game looked a lot like DDR. I mean, it just looked like the

54:52.500 --> 54:59.060
other game, but the only difference was they had those like bombs or mines or whatever.

54:59.060 --> 55:02.980
That was like the only difference. It basically was DDR. I don't know. That's what I thought.

55:02.980 --> 55:04.800
See, now that could be what a jury member is going to say.

55:04.800 --> 55:06.380
Isn't that interesting that I just said that?

55:06.380 --> 55:08.260
Yes, it was riveting. Thank you.

55:08.260 --> 55:22.260
Well, I think, sometimes I think folks that are hardcore fans of either In the Groove or DDR, you know, and have too much of a one-track mind where they only see the stuff they want to see in the games.

55:22.260 --> 55:32.260
They don't kind of think that, oh, if this really does go to court, an unbiased jury is going to take a look at it and, you know, have their say.

55:32.260 --> 55:35.400
Alright, enough lawsuit chat, I'm done.

55:35.400 --> 55:41.940
Um, blah, blah, blah, blah, let's see. I'm reading chat room. www.orangelaunasradio.com, click on chat.

55:41.940 --> 55:45.780
Oh, this is cute. Um, Sakurino has a question from Eclatov.

55:45.780 --> 55:50.020
Um, are you able to hook him up with Noria?

55:50.020 --> 55:53.020
I don't know, I don't know why somebody would want that, but...

55:53.020 --> 55:56.020
No.

55:56.020 --> 55:59.540
Do you know Noria? Are you on a first-name basis?

55:59.540 --> 56:04.540
Like Sana and Togo and all them, they just walk around the office all day, right?

56:04.540 --> 56:07.540
Maybe in Japan.

56:07.540 --> 56:12.540
I mean, we occasionally get people in our office. I don't ever remember seeing Noria.

56:12.540 --> 56:16.540
And if I did, she'd probably come at me all crazy.

56:16.540 --> 56:20.540
You have to understand that Naoki keeps a close eye on his harem, okay?

56:20.540 --> 56:25.540
They don't leave Japan.

56:25.540 --> 56:29.940
In fact, I remember the year that Akira Yomoka came to E3, and you were just as excited as I was.

56:29.940 --> 56:32.940
And I stalked him!

56:32.940 --> 56:34.940
And three pictures!

56:34.940 --> 56:36.940
That's great.

56:36.940 --> 56:38.940
Anyway.

56:38.940 --> 56:41.940
Um, let's do this. Let's go ahead and, um...

56:41.940 --> 56:44.940
Actually, let's move to the Pump It Up topic, since we were kind of getting into that a little bit,

56:44.940 --> 56:46.940
and then we'll open up the Skype line after another break.

56:46.940 --> 56:48.940
Um, Pump It Up...

56:48.940 --> 56:50.940
Um, now...

56:50.940 --> 56:52.940
We, actually, this game's not gonna be out.

56:52.940 --> 56:56.940
Now, what's the official name of the game here we're looking at for Pump It Up Exceed Home?

56:56.940 --> 56:57.940
Pump It Up Exceed.

56:57.940 --> 57:00.940
Pump It Up Exceed. The home release is coming out the 31st.

57:00.940 --> 57:04.940
We got a copy though, or I should say, Miklotov got a copy.

57:04.940 --> 57:07.940
Now, don't forget to turn on your mic.

57:07.940 --> 57:09.940
Heck yeah, I got a copy.

57:09.940 --> 57:11.940
How did you get a copy?

57:11.940 --> 57:13.940
Okay, it's a great story.

57:13.940 --> 57:14.940
Was it through Source's economy?

57:14.940 --> 57:15.940
No, no, no.

57:15.940 --> 57:18.940
Secret and Amuro agreements where they share games with each other?

57:18.940 --> 57:26.940
After work one day, I was like, hey, I want both Pump It Ups for Xbox and PS2 when they come out, because I know they're different.

57:26.940 --> 57:32.940
I better go to EB and pre-order them. So I went in there and I pre-ordered it, and the guy was like, hey, we got one traded in today.

57:32.940 --> 57:36.940
Even though it's not out, do you want it? I was like, heck yeah, I want it. So I bought it.

57:36.940 --> 57:44.940
How does someone trade something in that's not out yet? They don't even question it. Is that DDR Stream 3? Okay.

57:44.940 --> 57:51.940
They were like, yeah, it doesn't come with the pad, and we're still charging you the price as if it were coming with the pad, but do you want it?

57:51.940 --> 57:54.940
And I was like, hmm, I'll have it a month early. Yeah, I'll take it.

57:54.940 --> 58:00.940
So I'm just gonna trade it in when it actually comes out, but yeah, I've had the game since about the beginning of August.

58:00.940 --> 58:02.940
That's the Xbox version?

58:02.940 --> 58:04.940
I have the PS2 one. Um, I want-

58:04.940 --> 58:06.940
You do, do ya?

58:06.940 --> 58:08.940
Yeah, I do have the PS2 one. Huh.

58:08.940 --> 58:10.940
We'll have to talk later.

58:10.940 --> 58:16.940
But, yeah, um... God, that game's a punk.

58:16.940 --> 58:25.940
Okay, so tell us about what... Now, you are more familiar, and this is hilarious because you're the one that works for Konami, but you're more familiar with the arcade version than probably any of us.

58:25.940 --> 58:29.940
So, um, tell us about the differences between the home version and the arcade.

58:29.940 --> 58:33.940
Well, okay, Exceed Arcade has a whole bunch of songs.

58:33.940 --> 58:36.940
We actually got a pretty decent song list for America.

58:36.940 --> 58:39.940
We have, on the PS2 one, 101 songs.

58:39.940 --> 58:43.940
The Xbox one has 97. I don't know why.

58:43.940 --> 58:49.940
But we lost a couple pop songs for America,

58:49.940 --> 58:55.940
and we also gained some of the revival songs from Exceed 2, which is random.

58:55.940 --> 59:05.440
They censored a couple of the Spanish songs, which makes no sense to me, and that's about the only differences.

59:05.440 --> 59:08.440
Okay, so tell us about, like, the unlock. How do you unlock songs in the games?

59:08.440 --> 59:17.440
I have no clue. I've been playing that game since the beginning of August. I've unlocked four songs now, or, okay, three, and then Justin unlocked one today.

59:17.440 --> 59:22.600
And, I mean, if you think about it, there are four modes.

59:22.600 --> 59:30.080
And to play songs in certain modes, like, say, I want to play, uh, what's the song?

59:30.080 --> 59:33.560
I want to play Chicken Wing in survival mode.

59:33.560 --> 59:34.560
Okay.

59:34.560 --> 59:35.560
Okay.

59:35.560 --> 59:38.720
Well, it's not unlocked in survival mode, so I have to play it in home mode just to

59:38.720 --> 59:40.240
unlock it.

59:40.240 --> 59:45.180
And so I had to go through the game pretty much and play every song in every mode just

59:45.180 --> 59:49.740
to make sure that every song appeared in every mode, and I don't even have that still! So

59:49.740 --> 59:56.140
I've pretty much played over 400 songs, and I've only unlocked 4 songs. But, along the

59:56.140 --> 01:00:03.140
way, you also unlock modifiers. So, I mean, I've not been totally bored out of my mind

01:00:03.140 --> 01:00:10.140
playing the same songs over and over again. I get random cool modifiers that are weird.

01:00:10.540 --> 01:00:15.100
I like the one that was coming from the corner. Yeah, Exceed modifier. It's very hard to read

01:00:15.100 --> 01:00:20.340
There's also one where it comes from the bottom middle and just kind of throws it all the way up and then to the side

01:00:21.020 --> 01:00:23.340
it also has something like break and something like

01:00:23.900 --> 01:00:28.940
Wave it has random velocity. You can change the arrow skins

01:00:30.060 --> 01:00:37.180
But yeah, it's it's a pretty mean game to try to unlock songs. There's also boobs and ass video

01:00:37.180 --> 01:00:43.300
Yeah, I mean this thought I'd put that in there right there. This game got a t-rating and you know, it's censored

01:00:43.300 --> 01:00:51.020
two Spanish words, but there's a lot of breasts. Lots and lots of breasts. I don't understand

01:00:51.020 --> 01:00:52.020
it.

01:00:52.020 --> 01:00:53.020
Like, not bare breasts.

01:00:53.020 --> 01:00:58.220
No, but I mean, they smack her in the chin when she moves. The whole video is about her

01:00:58.220 --> 01:00:59.220
breasts.

01:00:59.220 --> 01:01:03.180
There's a lot of videos that look like internet Flash videos out there, but...

01:01:03.180 --> 01:01:04.180
They're really funny.

01:01:04.180 --> 01:01:06.980
Well, you know what, though? I thought one thing that really impressed me, really, really

01:01:06.980 --> 01:01:12.540
impressed me about Pump It Up Exceed on PlayStation 2 was the fact that every song had a unique

01:01:12.540 --> 01:01:18.020
video it wasn't some type of loop video like all these like little clips kind of

01:01:18.020 --> 01:01:21.120
looped over and over again it was like each one even though the video quality

01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:25.440
may be a little question mark some of them look like flash animation so one

01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:30.980
love is just absolutely beautiful it's really nice CG it looks and then rate on

01:01:30.980 --> 01:01:36.380
the TV rappers that leaves alive then yeah it started off as an anime and then

01:01:36.380 --> 01:01:41.900
it kind of looked like Parappa and then it went to Mega Man and yeah it's very

01:01:41.900 --> 01:01:44.020
Very odd.

01:01:44.020 --> 01:01:49.360
And some of the actual music videos for actual songs are like Little Less Conversation, Name

01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:53.620
of the Game, and Walkie Talkie Man, which is the stupidest song ever on Crazy.

01:01:53.620 --> 01:01:54.740
It's a 17.

01:01:54.740 --> 01:01:58.980
Tell us about where In the Groove might have gotten some of its inspiration from Pump It

01:01:58.980 --> 01:01:59.980
Up.

01:01:59.980 --> 01:02:00.980
What?

01:02:00.980 --> 01:02:03.220
Like, the really hard songs.

01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:04.220
Get it?

01:02:04.220 --> 01:02:05.220
Oh.

01:02:05.220 --> 01:02:06.220
Okay.

01:02:06.220 --> 01:02:07.220
I was drawing on my foot.

01:02:07.220 --> 01:02:08.220
I'm sorry.

01:02:08.220 --> 01:02:09.220
It's alright.

01:02:09.220 --> 01:02:10.260
Hope you're having fun.

01:02:10.260 --> 01:02:18.320
I was. Yeah, it's got some really crappy steps for crazy, but if you get the Xbox one, there's

01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:23.340
actually, on Xbox Live for free, you can download a step editor, which is not in the PS2 one,

01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:24.340
which is really awesome.

01:02:24.340 --> 01:02:29.460
It's kind of weird that you can download a step editor on Xbox Live. I don't know, it's

01:02:29.460 --> 01:02:30.460
kind of weird.

01:02:30.460 --> 01:02:35.380
Yeah, but I'll be happy, because I can finally make steps to like, songs that only have one

01:02:35.380 --> 01:02:39.480
set of steps, and that's not even one set of steps for freestyle and normal, it's just

01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:43.780
It's like they only have normal steps, and that's it, and they're like a two.

01:02:43.780 --> 01:02:47.840
So it's actually, the Xbox One is probably going to be the best one with song packs and

01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:51.080
that downloadable step editor.

01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:54.520
Song packs on the Xbox One are going to be a little more expensive though, right?

01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:58.460
Yeah, I don't think it's actually been officially announced, but they were tossing around the

01:02:58.460 --> 01:03:01.920
idea of seven dollars for three songs.

01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:07.660
However, it would include licenses, so I mean, it's not like you're going to get, hopefully,

01:03:07.660 --> 01:03:10.380
It's not like you're going to get just Banya songs.

01:03:10.380 --> 01:03:15.340
You'll also get, like, I Hope to Goodness, Lazanka, or Fairy Boat, or Black Cat, or all

01:03:15.340 --> 01:03:19.780
those really cool songs from the really old games that don't show up anymore.

01:03:19.780 --> 01:03:22.660
I was pissed off that Run to You was not in the song list.

01:03:22.660 --> 01:03:25.060
Although, the game does have a very impressive song list.

01:03:25.060 --> 01:03:26.780
Yeah, it's really amazing.

01:03:26.780 --> 01:03:28.180
I couldn't believe it.

01:03:28.180 --> 01:03:34.420
All right, so I'll sum up the PlayStation version of Pump It Up Exceed, the good stuff

01:03:34.420 --> 01:03:35.860
and the bad stuff, and do you recommend it?

01:03:35.860 --> 01:03:41.100
The good stuff is that it's Pump It Up and it's the superior dancing game.

01:03:41.100 --> 01:03:46.700
The bad stuff is that Mad Cats makes the pad.

01:03:46.700 --> 01:03:52.860
And that some of the steps are just utter crap because there's no reason Walkie Talkie

01:03:52.860 --> 01:03:58.660
Man should go to every last little noise in the whole song.

01:03:58.660 --> 01:03:59.980
The end.

01:03:59.980 --> 01:04:05.060
I would say I think that the game is pretty good looking.

01:04:05.060 --> 01:04:10.020
I think it's got a huge song list, I love the fact that there's a unique video for every

01:04:10.020 --> 01:04:12.500
song, I think it's just kind of a fun game.

01:04:12.500 --> 01:04:17.580
I think some of the songs are kind of a little, especially some of the Banya songs are a little

01:04:17.580 --> 01:04:18.580
average.

01:04:18.580 --> 01:04:23.380
Yeah, Banya is very hit or miss, at least in my eyes.

01:04:23.380 --> 01:04:24.780
But the K-pop stuff is pretty rad.

01:04:24.780 --> 01:04:28.740
Oh, the K-pop stuff is great, and so is the pop, because it's a lot of Latin songs.

01:04:28.740 --> 01:04:31.420
And the regular pop stuff is cool.

01:04:31.420 --> 01:04:34.460
So I was very surprised by Pump It Up Home Version.

01:04:34.460 --> 01:04:38.600
I've gone from probably just not really interested in picking it up to.

01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:41.000
I definitely want to pick this game up.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.160
I think it's going to be really good.

01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:49.120
However, the bad things about the game, the interface still annoys the shit out of me.

01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:54.120
I hate Pump's interface with a passion, and it is no better in XSEDE.

01:04:54.120 --> 01:04:59.880
The thing is, it's based off the arcade one, and the arcade one has no, like, left and

01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:01.080
right buttons.

01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:02.080
So you have...

01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:03.080
It still sucks.

01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:04.080
They could have done something else.

01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:08.080
the way you put in codes, it sucks.

01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:12.080
Well that's why you can play in home mode and then you can hold the triangle button down and just get out of your home.

01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:16.080
I don't want to play in home mode, I want easy modifiers in arcade mode.

01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:20.080
This always pisses me off. Anyway, it's not just that, I just don't like the

01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:24.080
huge wheel that takes forever to get around and just, I don't know.

01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:28.080
That's just me. It is.

01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:32.080
Justin, what do you think, because I know you're a long time DDR fan, what do you think of

01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:36.080
on PlayStation. I was very much like you when I first heard

01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:41.800
about it. I was like, oh, let's pump it up. I've seen that so many times at MGL and Sviggle,

01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:46.080
the local arcades, and I just do not care. Sviggle doesn't have it anymore. MGL took

01:05:46.080 --> 01:05:47.320
it. Oh, well.

01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:59.000
Okay, sorry. That's my local arcade. Anyways, but after playing it on Shane's Copy,

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:09.000
I found it was, like, amazingly fun. I love the fact that the videos are all fun and not just looped animations, and they all have a sense of humor to them for the most part.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:16.000
I love the songs. I've always loved K-pop, and the fact that Caution is on this game is so amazing.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:17.000
And Starion, yes.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:18.000
And Starion, oh my god.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
We're gonna have to play Korean music later.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:21.000
Yes, we will.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:24.000
Even though I don't have a whole lot of pump music.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:28.000
I know, you need to bring me this pumpsy roar. Anyway.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:34.120
But yeah, I think I'm definitely going to pick up the Xbox version, because I like the

01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:40.880
Xbox better than the PS2, sadly, so I will definitely pick that up, and yeah, it looks

01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:43.120
like a great game.

01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:48.600
Xtavor, what little you saw of the game, what do you think of Pump It Up?

01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:51.240
You know, I saw it as much as you did, I think.

01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:52.240
Oh, I guess that's true.

01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:54.720
I thought you left the room for some reason.

01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:55.720
Okay.

01:06:55.720 --> 01:07:01.080
It seems like a game that I'll watch you play occasionally, you know?

01:07:01.080 --> 01:07:06.920
I won't play it, because I, you know, really suck at those games, and it just looks really,

01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:11.320
I don't know, hard to play.

01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:12.320
The end.

01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:13.320
Okay.

01:07:13.320 --> 01:07:16.920
Loki, I know you really didn't get to see it for very long, but what did you think from

01:07:16.920 --> 01:07:17.920
what little you saw?

01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:19.880
It looked like Pump It Up.

01:07:19.880 --> 01:07:22.000
The crazy steps I still think are ridiculous.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:23.000
I do too.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:27.000
Like, it was ridiculous in the arcade, and on a homepad it's...

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:28.000
Why?

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:29.000
Stop.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:30.000
Please.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
Sir, on a Mad Catz homepad of all things.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:33.000
Oh god, no.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
That would never work.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:36.000
Good luck.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:39.880
Actually, as much as I hate Mad Catz, and as much as everybody hates Mad Catz, they

01:07:39.880 --> 01:07:45.080
have been using those at the Pump Qualifiers for the World Pump Tournament, and apparently

01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:46.800
they are pretty good.

01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:50.000
Like, they can aid Dignity, which is a really, really hard song.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:53.120
I call bullshit until I play on one myself.

01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:54.480
We'll see though.

01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:57.520
Fine, whatever.

01:07:57.520 --> 01:07:58.920
Alright.

01:07:58.920 --> 01:08:02.800
Okay, we're gonna go to a break you guys, and when we come back, we're gonna take your calls on the

01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:06.640
Skype line. We'll also talk a little bit about the tiny news we had in the, um...

01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:07.560
well actually it was

01:08:07.560 --> 01:08:11.400
kind of major, but I think most of you guys have read about this by now, the Xtreme 2

01:08:11.400 --> 01:08:13.440
song list, as well as

01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:14.480
Karaoke

01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:18.240
Revolution. Some song lists showed up for that as well.

01:08:18.240 --> 01:08:25.240
So we're going to talk about all that when we come back from this break, and taking your calls on the Skype line, www.orangeloungeradio.com, click on interact with us.

01:08:25.240 --> 01:08:31.240
And in this break, I'm going to start off with a song that was kind of inspired by the chat room, because I think I'm ignoring them, but I'm not.

01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:34.240
So this one's for the chat room, even those people that were complaining about it.

01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:39.240
In fact, we're going to make this an entire break of 2DX songs, so we'll be back after this.

01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:09.240
And the sun is giving you the sight of the green bridge

01:09:09.240 --> 01:09:13.240
I keep on running close to you, baby

01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:16.240
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes

01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:20.240
Cause you're blind, I have been through

01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:24.240
Wonderful times of forgetting completely

01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:28.240
I'm too tall, let's lay together

01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:31.240
I'm too tall, and it's my fault

01:09:31.240 --> 01:09:41.240
I'm too strong, let's bring it together I'm too strong, let me go see me

01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:44.240
It's very very sweet

01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:17.840
Check it out, come check it out

01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:21.040
Catch me, catch you down

01:11:21.040 --> 01:11:24.040
Baby, come check it out

01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:25.640
Put me, come check it out

01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:30.240
Catch me, catch you down

01:11:31.240 --> 01:11:34.240
You are, you are, don't get it

01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:37.240
You are, you are, you're too much

01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:40.240
You're the only one who can love you

01:13:40.240 --> 01:13:57.240
I'm digging through the midst of love to find my way

01:13:57.240 --> 01:14:07.240
My heart belongs, I'm digging through the midst of love

01:14:07.240 --> 01:14:16.240
To fight the pain my heart belongs to

01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:25.040
Orange Lounge Radio, Maimani Music, and more.

01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:29.640
Orange Lounge Radio back at you here in that break you heard a little bit of Sylvia Drive,

01:16:29.640 --> 01:16:37.160
9th Style, Injection of Love, Red, Inazuma, Happy Sky, Everyday Lovely Day, 8th Consumer.

01:16:37.160 --> 01:16:40.160
It's going to be a booing Everyday Lovely Day 4, Miggletov.

01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:43.160
It's not a crappy song. You're a crappy song.

01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:45.160
All right.

01:16:45.160 --> 01:16:51.160
We're going to open up the old Skyplines right now and take your calls here on our program.

01:16:51.160 --> 01:16:56.160
If you'd like to call us, www.orangelauncherradio.com and click on interact with us.

01:16:56.160 --> 01:17:01.160
Miggletov, I did get a question from somebody who is not able to call us on the Skypline.

01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:02.160
Well, then they're losers.

01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:04.160
But had a question. It's Rini.

01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:06.160
Well, I might not answer it then.

01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:27.160
So he had a question that I need to ask you. Alright. Basically what he wants to know, is Konami doing anything for the fan requests on DDR Freak for new stuff? Like new mods, new features in DDR, maybe songs. When he says new mods, he's saying things like, you know, wave, those types of things.

01:17:27.160 --> 01:17:31.160
Has there been an official request for fan requests?

01:17:31.160 --> 01:17:35.160
So, in other words, has there been something on DDR Freak asking you to say things?

01:17:35.160 --> 01:17:36.160
Yeah.

01:17:36.160 --> 01:17:38.160
I don't believe I've seen one in a little while.

01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:43.160
Well, then, they're just requesting stuff that's not being heard.

01:17:43.160 --> 01:17:45.160
Alright, alright, I gotcha.

01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:46.160
Bye, John!

01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:47.160
Alright.

01:17:47.160 --> 01:17:48.160
Anyway...

01:17:48.160 --> 01:17:49.160
Oh, goodie!

01:17:49.160 --> 01:17:52.160
The gay-straight ratio has gotten worse!

01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:57.160
My friend John just showed up, so he's here now to further surround Loki.

01:17:57.160 --> 01:17:59.160
We won't make you gay by end of show.

01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:00.160
No, I'm kidding.

01:18:00.160 --> 01:18:03.440
I honestly don't know.

01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:09.700
Usually when Konami wants to listen, or really cares to listen, you'll see like a huge thread

01:18:09.700 --> 01:18:16.880
devoted to, oh, Konami's asking us to, you know, say, put this song in, so please list

01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:18.480
your songs you want in.

01:18:18.480 --> 01:18:23.840
Do people, now, you don't have power over what goes in the game.

01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:24.840
No.

01:18:24.840 --> 01:18:25.840
So...

01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:28.420
Well, I had the power, no, no, I didn't even have the power, but I had a really vocal voice

01:18:28.420 --> 01:18:32.300
about something that maybe in a few years I can talk about.

01:18:32.300 --> 01:18:36.040
Okay, but you can't talk about it now. I can't talk about it now.

01:18:36.040 --> 01:18:42.180
Do people that have the power to change what's in the game, do they read DDR Freak and those

01:18:42.180 --> 01:18:45.100
types of things? I don't know who would actually have the power

01:18:45.100 --> 01:18:48.420
to change the game. Yes, they do. So keep making those pointless

01:18:48.420 --> 01:18:53.360
threads! Alright.

01:18:53.360 --> 01:19:00.080
love it when you make a please put in sakura or please put in... what's another crappy

01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:12.000
song? A crappy song! Butterfly! Oh! Cartoon Heroes! Alright. So keep making those pointless

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:17.480
threads on DDRFreak with your requests and maybe somebody from Konami will give a crap.

01:19:17.480 --> 01:19:23.280
we'll see. Yeah, when we laugh at it. You know what's going to happen? When the head

01:19:23.280 --> 01:19:26.900
of PR or whatever is coming out to our company to speak about their games and stuff, I'm

01:19:26.900 --> 01:19:31.880
just going to say, keep playing Sakurai the next one, or you know, just do... I have a

01:19:31.880 --> 01:19:38.280
controversial question for you. I'm playing Meteos, what is it? Do people at the office

01:19:38.280 --> 01:19:45.280
make fun of DDR Freak Post? I have openly admitted I do. Everybody knows I'm the jerk,

01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:51.280
So, I mean, how last year? Remember the extreme thread? That was a big joke. It was fun.

01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:59.280
You know what you need? You need a giant plotter printer so you can print the thread, or whatever the post is, super big on the wall, so that you can laugh at it.

01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:06.280
You know, you can just have, like, wallpaper on the wall with really bad posts from DDR3. Ooh, I'm gonna do that in my game room if I ever get one.

01:20:06.280 --> 01:20:09.280
How come you guys didn't do clues this year?

01:20:09.280 --> 01:20:11.280
I can't really say.

01:20:11.280 --> 01:20:14.880
Okay, that's that. That's all Gamepro's fault.

01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:18.640
All Gamepro. I got served. Yeah, that's all Gamepro's fault. Let's go to a call.

01:20:18.640 --> 01:20:23.040
Hello, you are on Orange Launch Radio.

01:20:23.040 --> 01:20:26.280
Hello, my friend. What's on your mind?

01:20:26.280 --> 01:20:29.560
Well, let me see. Just, you know, going through the usual on a Sunday,

01:20:29.560 --> 01:20:34.380
me heading out to Long Island to play 2DX and breaking another in the

01:20:34.380 --> 01:20:35.520
group machine in the city.

01:20:35.520 --> 01:20:39.480
Oh, that reminds me. I have news for you because you were wanting me to come to

01:20:39.480 --> 01:20:42.320
the Digital Life Expo, and you're actually not the only person on the East Coast who

01:20:42.320 --> 01:20:47.580
wanted me to come out there. I'm having a meeting with my boss next week to negotiate

01:20:47.580 --> 01:20:51.360
trying to get the time off to make that happen. I already have a place to stay if I come out

01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:55.660
there, so the plan is being set in motion. I was serious last week. I'm going to try

01:20:55.660 --> 01:20:59.400
and make it happen, so we'll see. It all depends on it.

01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:03.260
If anything, if you're still having problems with, like, you know, finding a place to stay

01:21:03.260 --> 01:21:09.300
day for other people, there's this cat named, you know, Sketch on the New York forms. He's

01:21:09.300 --> 01:21:14.100
usually very, he usually offers, you know, his apartment for people who are actually

01:21:14.100 --> 01:21:20.340
going to be in the tournament. So, don't take my word, I mean, don't say I, you know, don't

01:21:20.340 --> 01:21:24.140
say I was, you know, I was, wait a minute, don't say I sent you, but, you know, you want

01:21:24.140 --> 01:21:29.500
me to stay at the house of a complete internet stranger. No, but I've already met him. What

01:21:29.500 --> 01:21:33.500
What if he rapes me or something? That would be, you would feel bad.

01:21:33.500 --> 01:21:35.500
You wouldn't feel anything.

01:21:35.500 --> 01:21:37.500
But he's very generous.

01:21:37.500 --> 01:21:40.500
I'm teasing, I'm sure this guy's great.

01:21:40.500 --> 01:21:42.500
It would just be like you sitting down.

01:21:42.500 --> 01:21:46.500
Shut the hell up.

01:21:46.500 --> 01:21:47.500
All right.

01:21:47.500 --> 01:21:51.500
Can you speak for us about, you know, any more Konami stuff that you might know?

01:21:51.500 --> 01:21:54.500
That's unclassified.

01:21:54.500 --> 01:21:58.580
classified konami stuff that you might know miklata

01:21:58.580 --> 01:21:59.720
uh... unclear

01:21:59.720 --> 01:22:03.540
but now many of us for one god damn minute jesus i'd like to do a little

01:22:03.540 --> 01:22:04.820
further

01:22:04.820 --> 01:22:09.640
any unclassified konami stuff that you can speak up and classified

01:22:09.640 --> 01:22:12.460
uh... you know things that will get you fired for your nd a

01:22:12.460 --> 01:22:12.980
there's this

01:22:12.980 --> 01:22:15.980
well i i i think lunch at like uh...

01:22:15.980 --> 01:22:17.560
between one and three

01:22:17.560 --> 01:22:19.780
so that's not going to be fired

01:22:19.780 --> 01:22:22.140
besides you

01:22:22.140 --> 01:22:23.580
well what was that

01:22:23.580 --> 01:22:25.620
Who else is making steps besides you?

01:22:25.620 --> 01:22:27.820
Sorry, you gotta excuse the retainer.

01:22:27.820 --> 01:22:31.100
Can you say that? Who else is making steps on the staff besides you?

01:22:31.100 --> 01:22:32.760
I won't name names,

01:22:32.760 --> 01:22:39.220
but if you look at the instruction booklet for UltraMix 2,

01:22:39.220 --> 01:22:41.880
the names pretty much haven't changed.

01:22:41.880 --> 01:22:44.980
Oh, so the same people who did the steps for the last one?

01:22:44.980 --> 01:22:46.540
Well, now he didn't say that exactly.

01:22:46.540 --> 01:22:47.540
I answered that?

01:22:47.540 --> 01:22:48.780
Or we could just assume.

01:22:48.780 --> 01:22:52.140
Well, you have to infer from his clues, young man.

01:22:52.140 --> 01:22:57.140
Okay. Ooh, I gave a clue. I'm gonna get in trouble. Yes, you are.

01:22:57.140 --> 01:23:01.140
Another question. Extreme 2, are the steps going to be horrible?

01:23:01.140 --> 01:23:04.140
Just give us a kiss.

01:23:04.140 --> 01:23:08.140
Well, are the steps going to be horrible in Extreme 2?

01:23:08.140 --> 01:23:10.140
Extreme 2 is really fun, I have to say.

01:23:10.140 --> 01:23:16.140
With the exception of the licenses, I mean, with the exception of the songs, you know, the other Konami songs have been there, the licenses.

01:23:16.140 --> 01:23:17.140
Like the new stuff.

01:23:17.140 --> 01:23:18.140
Are they just going to bomb?

01:23:18.140 --> 01:23:19.140
The new shit.

01:23:19.140 --> 01:23:21.140
No, they're fun. They're really, really fun.

01:23:21.140 --> 01:23:26.140
I just hope they're challenging, too, because I don't want to be forced to make an edit.

01:23:26.140 --> 01:23:29.140
Well, have a little face.

01:23:29.140 --> 01:23:36.140
Well, nobody's forcing you. You could go play in the groove, and then you could use your hands and your feet and your butt and your head and your neighbor.

01:23:36.140 --> 01:23:38.140
Now, now, now, if you want some additional...

01:23:38.140 --> 01:23:40.140
Just so you can hit all the arrows.

01:23:40.140 --> 01:23:43.140
Wait for the game to come out, Taco, then you can start the shit talking.

01:23:43.140 --> 01:23:46.140
If you want some hard stuff, you've got to play the itoys stuff.

01:23:46.140 --> 01:23:49.140
Hands and feet mode is where it's friggin' annoying.

01:23:49.140 --> 01:23:56.140
I've done enough. I think I've injured my hand just playing in the groove trying to do the holds.

01:23:56.140 --> 01:23:59.140
I got a little bruised.

01:23:59.140 --> 01:24:04.140
I think I understand what you're getting at, Zaku, because this is kind of the feeling I'm reading on DDR Freak.

01:24:04.140 --> 01:24:11.140
This is the general vibe I get on the DDR Freak threads, is that DDR Extreme was a wee bit of a letdown for some fans.

01:24:11.140 --> 01:24:13.140
It was just crap. That's it.

01:24:13.140 --> 01:24:15.140
No. Extreme was good.

01:24:15.140 --> 01:24:17.140
Most of the sexual licenses were crap.

01:24:17.140 --> 01:24:21.140
Hold on, Zaku, don't interrupt me. Alright, don't interrupt me.

01:24:21.140 --> 01:24:26.140
Does Extreme 2 make up for the things that tick people off about Extreme 1?

01:24:26.140 --> 01:24:29.140
First of all, I think those people are whiners.

01:24:29.140 --> 01:24:33.140
There's no reason that I thought they were decent steps.

01:24:33.140 --> 01:24:34.140
Wait a minute, though.

01:24:34.140 --> 01:24:37.140
Zaku cannot be held back on Extreme.

01:24:37.140 --> 01:24:41.140
Zaku, I will hang up on you.

01:24:41.140 --> 01:24:43.140
Hold on, I'll get back to you in a minute.

01:24:43.140 --> 01:24:46.140
Which was the better game last year, Ultra Mix 2 or Extreme?

01:24:46.140 --> 01:24:48.140
Ultra Mix 2, everybody knows that.

01:24:48.140 --> 01:24:49.140
Okay, well then there you go.

01:24:49.140 --> 01:24:55.140
I'm just defending Extreme, because people belittle it because it wasn't the Japanese one.

01:24:55.140 --> 01:24:58.140
Oh my god, the steps are too easy because they're not 12s.

01:24:58.140 --> 01:25:03.140
I think people were a little harsh on Extreme, but it did have its issues.

01:25:03.140 --> 01:25:04.140
Yeah, I know, I know.

01:25:04.140 --> 01:25:05.140
I mean, it had...

01:25:05.140 --> 01:25:06.140
It was like Maximizer.

01:25:06.140 --> 01:25:08.140
Maximizer was cool.

01:25:08.140 --> 01:25:10.140
Interface, we all know that that's better now.

01:25:10.140 --> 01:25:12.140
I liked Last Year's but whatever.

01:25:12.140 --> 01:25:16.860
It's a song list. We've seen more transplants from Extreme, like, you know,

01:25:16.860 --> 01:25:20.500
Irasitha Baman, Lago Badevita, all those Extreme songs you wanted are

01:25:20.500 --> 01:25:23.700
in Extreme 2, it seems. Cartoon Heroes, hello.

01:25:23.700 --> 01:25:28.020
The fact that they nailed, you know,

01:25:28.020 --> 01:25:32.060
they nailed Silence was pretty much it. Your phone's ringing.

01:25:32.060 --> 01:25:35.780
Yes, I know, so I'm going to wrap this up right now.

01:25:35.780 --> 01:25:40.460
Bottom line is this, I just hope Extreme 2 is a lot better than Extreme 2.

01:25:40.460 --> 01:25:47.460
It is. Duly noted. Duly noted. I gotta get this called. Alright. Take care, Cool Cat.

01:25:48.860 --> 01:25:50.340
Alright.

01:25:50.340 --> 01:25:52.620
Go get that phone. Don't be rude.

01:25:52.620 --> 01:25:58.500
Alright. I'm trying to read what's going on in the chair room here.

01:25:58.500 --> 01:26:00.020
Umm...

01:26:00.020 --> 01:26:02.020
Are the steps still gonna suck

01:26:02.020 --> 01:26:04.140
because you're working on them?

01:26:04.140 --> 01:26:08.540
Oh, burn, yeah.

01:26:08.540 --> 01:26:13.540
I have stuff I wasn't proud of too, and I have stuff I'm not proud of and other things.

01:26:13.540 --> 01:26:17.540
As long as Konami of Hawaii can learn how to cut songs, you know?

01:26:17.540 --> 01:26:21.540
Actually be able to edit them like, I don't know, Skulk, for example?

01:26:21.540 --> 01:26:27.540
You know, as much as I thought I hated the edit for Skulk, I don't mind it anymore because

01:26:27.540 --> 01:26:31.540
there's... I don't think I'd want to be dancing to, or...

01:26:31.540 --> 01:26:36.660
dancing, stepping on arrows to the part where he sings a lot just because I

01:26:36.660 --> 01:26:40.180
don't think it would be that fun. Granted, it was the same thing over and over again for the first episode.

01:26:40.180 --> 01:26:45.820
I liked the cut of Skulk, so you shut up. Um, alright. Um, damn, now I forgot the

01:26:45.820 --> 01:26:48.220
question I was gonna ask. I don't know what it was either. Was it

01:26:48.220 --> 01:26:52.620
Meteos-related? Because that's what I'm doing. No, it's not Meteos-related. It's back on extreme.

01:26:52.620 --> 01:26:56.680
I'm sorry to make you talk about work. At least I'm not asking you about, you know

01:26:56.680 --> 01:27:06.680
I don't know what. What was I going to say about Extreme? Oh, I don't know if you can answer this, so, you know, feel free to tell me you can't if you can't.

01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:19.680
But, we all know one of the reasons why people loved UltraMix 2 is because DDR fans, like yourself, and other DDR fans who now work for Konami were responsible for the steps.

01:27:19.680 --> 01:27:31.680
Extreme USA didn't have that. Does Extreme 2, now we all are assuming UltraMix 3 has it because you all worked on UltraMix before, does Extreme 2 now have the influence of those same DDR fans?

01:27:31.680 --> 01:27:33.680
I really can't say.

01:27:33.680 --> 01:27:35.680
I knew that. You just wanted to go back to media.

01:27:35.680 --> 01:27:45.680
So online stuff, are we gonna, you know, is online gonna be like pretty neat? Are they gonna do the same stuff they did with UltraMix 2 with Extreme 2?

01:27:45.680 --> 01:27:49.680
I can't say. If it's not been the press release, I really can't say anything about that.

01:27:49.680 --> 01:27:53.680
It has been in the press release. I just can't remember it.

01:27:53.680 --> 01:27:56.680
Yeah, nice try. Don't get him fired.

01:27:56.680 --> 01:27:59.680
They're already going to be pissed at him because he's been

01:27:59.680 --> 01:28:01.680
whoring up Pump It Up on the server.

01:28:01.680 --> 01:28:04.680
Heck yeah, that's all I do. They knew that when they hired me.

01:28:04.680 --> 01:28:07.680
They knew I was the pump player.

01:28:07.680 --> 01:28:09.680
Well, we'll see. We'll check them out. You know what?

01:28:09.680 --> 01:28:13.680
You know the best way to find out? Find a copy of the Extreme 2 manual

01:28:13.680 --> 01:28:16.960
and see the credits and see if these guys' names are in them.

01:28:16.960 --> 01:28:20.560
And that would be one way to find out. So, we'll see.

01:28:20.560 --> 01:28:24.760
Anyway, I don't see any more calls coming in.

01:28:24.760 --> 01:28:27.880
Actually, you know, you can also go to mobygames.com.

01:28:27.880 --> 01:28:31.660
Credits for UltraMix 2 are listed there to see who worked on it.

01:28:31.660 --> 01:28:34.840
If you don't actually have UltraMix 2, which if you don't, well,

01:28:34.840 --> 01:28:39.120
you're stupid. Yeah, it was like five bucks at Walmart a couple weeks ago. I saw

01:28:39.120 --> 01:28:40.520
some thread on DDR Free.

01:28:40.520 --> 01:28:42.520
I think that was a lie.

01:28:42.520 --> 01:28:43.520
Was it?

01:28:43.520 --> 01:28:44.520
I think that person was just stupid.

01:28:44.520 --> 01:28:45.520
Bastard.

01:28:45.520 --> 01:28:48.520
As are most people on DDR Freak.

01:28:48.520 --> 01:28:49.520
Careful.

01:28:49.520 --> 01:28:50.520
Hey.

01:28:50.520 --> 01:28:51.520
Hey.

01:28:51.520 --> 01:28:52.520
Watch it.

01:28:52.520 --> 01:28:53.520
We have our lovely-

01:28:53.520 --> 01:28:54.520
I have friends who are at DDR Freak.

01:28:54.520 --> 01:28:55.520
They know I love them.

01:28:55.520 --> 01:28:56.520
Alright.

01:28:56.520 --> 01:28:58.520
We have our lovely rewinds we do over on DDR Freak on Friday nights.

01:28:58.520 --> 01:29:00.520
I forgot to pause Meteos.

01:29:00.520 --> 01:29:01.520
I died.

01:29:01.520 --> 01:29:03.520
That's what you get.

01:29:03.520 --> 01:29:04.520
I'm sad.

01:29:04.520 --> 01:29:06.520
Don't tell me anything.

01:29:06.520 --> 01:29:12.520
Seriously, this show is probably the most we've gotten out of Shane all year, and that's really not that much.

01:29:12.520 --> 01:29:14.520
There really hasn't been that much.

01:29:14.520 --> 01:29:16.520
We can get more out of him if he is drunk.

01:29:16.520 --> 01:29:19.520
Yeah, I know. Anybody got some alcohol?

01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:21.520
John, you're here now. Go get him some alcohol.

01:29:21.520 --> 01:29:24.520
John's gonna go get him some alcohol.

01:29:24.520 --> 01:29:28.520
I'm not drinking tonight. I have work tomorrow.

01:29:28.520 --> 01:29:30.520
Alright. You'll be fine.

01:29:30.520 --> 01:29:33.520
No, I will punch somebody in the face if I'm hungover.

01:29:33.520 --> 01:29:35.520
Didn't you say you were immune to alcohol now?

01:29:35.520 --> 01:29:39.200
I say we test it. I say we don't.

01:29:39.200 --> 01:29:42.640
I say we do.

01:29:42.640 --> 01:29:46.240
Yeah, see, I might have to throw up a lot or something.

01:29:46.240 --> 01:29:49.360
Hurry up and call. If you're thinking about calling, now is a good time to call, because

01:29:49.360 --> 01:29:52.680
we're moving on to a new segment.

01:29:52.680 --> 01:29:56.440
No, we're moving on to a new segment. Anyway, I will fill...

01:29:56.440 --> 01:29:59.640
No, please, our chat room is going off enough about that tonight.

And the winning song will go into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's Bomani Music and More program, featuring DDR and video game music all week long.

01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:43.600
So, Loki won the cage match last week, and Loki, what was the name of your song?

01:34:43.600 --> 01:34:57.600
It was Wipeout Pure. It wasn't Onyx with something. God, I can't remember what the name of the song was.

01:34:57.600 --> 01:35:00.600
I'm still looking for it. I gotta find this here somewhere.

01:35:00.600 --> 01:35:04.600
I just don't remember. It was a cool song though.

01:35:04.600 --> 01:35:06.600
Well, I hope so.

01:35:06.600 --> 01:35:10.600
Well, I don't remember the title. I just remember, hey, it's that song from Wipeout, you know?

01:35:10.600 --> 01:35:12.040
uh...

01:35:12.040 --> 01:35:15.800
but that's not because i can't find it but i think it began with an a

01:35:15.800 --> 01:35:20.600
i can't remember uh... every drive by chance to play dole or fuck

01:35:20.600 --> 01:35:21.320
or not

01:35:21.320 --> 01:35:23.240
search by uh...

01:35:23.240 --> 01:35:24.120
modified

01:35:24.120 --> 01:35:26.480
they'll pull it up

01:35:26.480 --> 01:35:29.240
to delay the night skate match for a little bit you know what we search for

01:35:29.240 --> 01:35:32.800
the world but we can talk about the forty four hundred while you do that

01:35:32.800 --> 01:35:36.280
because it's really good show this plug this show the really like that

01:35:36.280 --> 01:35:37.560
the forty four hundred

01:35:37.560 --> 01:35:44.120
is a show on USA. It's about people who were abducted, but it's all fake.

01:35:44.120 --> 01:35:49.040
And it was all filmed in the daytime. It was all filmed in the daytime. And it's

01:35:49.040 --> 01:35:57.160
just really good. And it's like X-Files meets X-Men, so it's really cool. And I love it,

01:35:57.160 --> 01:36:01.280
and I'm crazy addicted to it. And you can go buy the first season on DVD

01:36:01.280 --> 01:36:04.740
for $20. Where at?

01:36:04.740 --> 01:36:13.060
place that sells that DVD for $20. I got mine at Fry's but I saw it at Suncoast today. It's

01:36:13.060 --> 01:36:20.500
still $20 and it's worth it. Not to make fun of, shut up John. It's a really good show.

01:36:20.500 --> 01:36:25.060
Here it is. Alright, we finally found it. The name of the song is Onyx. It's by a band

01:36:25.060 --> 01:36:30.480
called Cold Storage. Add it backwards. Alright. So here it is, a clip of last week's winner.

01:36:30.480 --> 01:36:33.500
Song number one you can vote for tonight. Remember you gotta be in our chatroom if you

01:36:33.500 --> 01:36:40.500
You want to vote? This is Cold Storage with Onyx.

01:38:03.500 --> 01:38:26.100
All righty, that was song number one in tonight's cage match.

01:38:26.100 --> 01:38:30.660
Last week's winner, after having to dig that one up, that was Cold Storage with Onyx.

01:38:30.660 --> 01:38:32.500
Will it win for another week in a row?

01:38:32.500 --> 01:38:37.540
will find out, but first we have to put it up against two brand new songs. So the second

01:38:37.540 --> 01:38:41.940
song in tonight's cage match is going to be my pick. And you guys remember DJ Sammy, he

01:38:41.940 --> 01:38:53.940
was really huge a couple years ago with that song Heaven, you know. And it was in DDR Max

01:38:53.940 --> 01:38:57.740
2 and everything, so I know you guys know it. Well he has a brand new single out, brand

01:38:57.740 --> 01:39:02.120
brand new single, and it's another cover. So guess what song he decided to take a spin

01:39:02.120 --> 01:39:06.900
on this time. It's actually an old Annie Lennox song. It's his version of Why, and it's my

01:39:06.900 --> 01:39:08.580
My pick for tonight's cage match, song number 2!

01:39:36.900 --> 01:39:46.900
How many times do I have to try to tell you That I'm sorry for the things I've done?

01:39:50.900 --> 01:39:55.900
But when I start to try to tell you That's when you have to tell me

01:39:55.900 --> 01:40:00.900
Hey, this kind of trouble's only just begun

01:40:00.900 --> 01:40:11.900
I've known myself too many times, why don't you ever learn to keep your face on the shelf?

01:40:11.900 --> 01:40:15.900
That's why I have to bend to the other way

01:40:15.900 --> 01:40:18.900
Because falling from your mouth

01:40:18.900 --> 01:40:22.900
Falling from your mouth

01:40:22.900 --> 01:40:25.900
Falling from your mouth

01:40:25.900 --> 01:40:33.900
Tell me why

01:40:33.900 --> 01:40:40.900
Why

01:40:40.900 --> 01:40:45.900
I'm bending down, maybe blind, maybe viciously uncut

01:40:45.900 --> 01:40:50.900
But I can still be what you're thinking

01:40:50.900 --> 01:40:59.900
Ah, I've heard it said too many times, you've been better off

01:40:59.900 --> 01:41:09.900
Why can't you see, it's just so mistaken, it's just so mistaken

01:41:09.900 --> 01:41:16.900
Let's go down to the water bed, so we can catch the waves on the sky

01:41:16.900 --> 01:41:19.320
Some things are better than some things

01:41:19.320 --> 01:41:22.320
But they still turn me inside out

01:41:23.620 --> 01:41:26.120
Turning inside out

01:41:27.120 --> 01:41:29.620
Turning inside out

01:41:29.620 --> 01:41:35.620
Tell me why

01:41:37.920 --> 01:41:43.920
Why

01:41:43.920 --> 01:41:49.920
They'll be wild

01:41:51.920 --> 01:41:56.920
Wild

01:41:58.920 --> 01:42:00.920
This is the book I'll liberate

01:42:00.920 --> 01:42:02.920
These are the words I'll never say

01:42:02.920 --> 01:42:04.920
This is the path I'll never thread

01:42:04.920 --> 01:42:06.920
These are the dreams I'll dream instead

01:42:06.920 --> 01:42:08.920
This is the joy that's seldom spent

01:42:08.920 --> 01:42:10.920
These are the tears we share

01:42:10.920 --> 01:42:12.920
This is the fear, this is the dread

01:42:12.920 --> 01:42:14.920
These are the gifts we have sent

01:42:14.920 --> 01:42:16.920
This is what they represent

01:42:16.920 --> 01:42:18.920
This is how I feel

01:42:18.920 --> 01:42:20.920
They can know how I feel

01:42:21.920 --> 01:42:23.920
I think you know how I feel

01:42:24.920 --> 01:42:26.920
They don't think you know what I feel

01:43:26.920 --> 01:43:32.420
The part where she's doing the ad-lib, you know, vocal stuff, you know, not the refrain.

01:43:32.420 --> 01:43:33.420
Where she's rapping.

01:43:33.420 --> 01:43:35.420
Where she's sorta, I guess, rapping.

01:43:35.420 --> 01:43:37.920
That just totally did not work at all.

01:43:37.920 --> 01:43:40.420
It was really bad in that sense.

01:43:40.420 --> 01:43:46.420
But DJ Sammy needs to make some new songs that are not covers.

01:43:46.420 --> 01:43:48.420
Please, please, please.

01:43:48.420 --> 01:43:50.420
Or pick some better 80's stuff.

01:43:50.420 --> 01:43:52.420
I mean, there's plenty of songs out there, you know.

01:43:52.420 --> 01:43:55.420
Personally, I like, you know, Westin Girls, you know, that's a good song.

01:43:55.420 --> 01:44:01.740
they did a really cool breakbeat version of it. Awesome. But that wasn't quite awesome.

01:44:01.740 --> 01:44:03.700
It was about seven.

01:44:03.700 --> 01:44:09.700
Alright. Mikl Tov, what did you think of that one? He's got his own mic. Hand him that one.

01:44:09.700 --> 01:44:19.700
Yeah, I didn't really care for this song, because I was playing Meteos. I still, I heard

01:44:19.700 --> 01:44:24.700
I've heard it, though, earlier today, and it's okay, but, um...

01:44:24.700 --> 01:44:25.700
I'd...

01:44:25.700 --> 01:44:28.700
Oh, crap, I forgot to pause!

01:44:28.700 --> 01:44:31.700
I give it a four.

01:44:31.700 --> 01:44:33.700
Alright, uh, Justin!

01:44:33.700 --> 01:44:45.700
I give it a six, because, like Loki, I really was not digging the part where she was just kind of talking the song and not actually singing it, because she apparently can't talk, but she can sing.

01:44:45.700 --> 01:44:47.700
Oh, well.

01:44:47.700 --> 01:44:55.700
I don't even like Annie Lennox that much. She's like a weird fucking redheaded bitch.

01:44:55.700 --> 01:44:59.700
But she's British! I thought you liked that!

01:44:59.700 --> 01:45:09.700
You know, I like Imogen or Imogen Heap, because she's cool and British, but Annie Lennox is weird.

01:45:09.700 --> 01:45:13.700
I don't know, I didn't like the original song, so I didn't care for this one either.

01:45:13.700 --> 01:45:16.700
It's a scale of 1 to 10, is that what it is?

01:45:16.700 --> 01:45:23.420
okay one John who your debut on the show John wow this is kind of scary

01:45:23.420 --> 01:45:29.060
I was kind of bored with it to be honest I give it a three all right and I

01:45:29.060 --> 01:45:33.180
give that song I agree the girl rapping was kind of weird and it doesn't hold a

01:45:33.180 --> 01:45:38.060
candle to the Annie Lennox original but it makes me think about the Annie Lennox

01:45:38.060 --> 01:45:43.660
original and why I love that redheaded bitch from the Eurydmics so I give it 20

01:45:43.660 --> 01:45:47.660
Alright, let's go to the next song.

01:45:47.660 --> 01:45:48.660
This is...

01:45:48.660 --> 01:45:51.460
You're a red-headed bitch, that's all.

01:45:51.460 --> 01:45:53.280
This is Dark Sakura's pick.

01:45:53.280 --> 01:45:56.540
She put a song in tonight's cage match, even though she's not here tonight.

01:45:56.540 --> 01:45:59.980
She's actually in chat, she just joined the chat room, so you guys can say hi to her over

01:45:59.980 --> 01:46:00.980
there.

01:46:00.980 --> 01:46:03.140
I think she'll be here in a little while before a podcast.

01:46:03.140 --> 01:46:04.660
I think she's supposed to be, anyway.

01:46:04.660 --> 01:46:05.660
We'll see.

01:46:05.660 --> 01:46:07.780
But she put this song in for you guys.

01:46:07.780 --> 01:46:09.780
It's an old favorite.

01:46:09.780 --> 01:46:19.500
It's Hamasaki Ayumi with Fly High and it's Hal's 2000 Mix.

01:46:19.500 --> 01:46:21.380
So here it is.

01:46:21.380 --> 01:46:22.380
You know her.

01:46:22.380 --> 01:46:23.380
Ayumi Hamasaki.

01:46:23.380 --> 01:46:24.380
What?

01:46:24.380 --> 01:46:28.260
What are you shaking your head for over there, low-key?

01:46:28.260 --> 01:46:29.260
Let's play the song.

01:46:29.260 --> 01:46:30.260
All right.

01:46:30.260 --> 01:46:31.260
Let's play the song.

01:46:31.260 --> 01:46:32.260
All right.

01:46:32.260 --> 01:46:33.260
Here we go.

01:46:33.260 --> 01:46:36.460
Ayumi Hamasaki fly high house 2000 mix. Here it is.

01:47:03.260 --> 01:47:05.260
I know it best, aren't you?

01:47:05.400 --> 01:47:06.920
It's real

01:47:07.060 --> 01:47:10.040
If you get tired, I will get yourproof

01:47:10.040 --> 01:47:13.800
Even though I do, it'll be for sure

01:47:14.080 --> 01:47:32.940
And if Councillor

01:49:32.940 --> 01:49:37.940
Me baby, more in love, baby

01:50:32.940 --> 01:50:36.940
They can't

01:50:53.940 --> 01:50:59.940
Alrighty, that was song number three, Ayumi, the one and only with Fly High, HAL's 2000 mix.

01:50:59.940 --> 01:51:07.440
Let's go around and see, on a scale of one to ten, where that song lies for the folks in our studio right now.

01:51:07.440 --> 01:51:07.940
Loki.

01:51:07.940 --> 01:51:11.940
You know, I want to start off by saying that it was generic trance, but, um...

01:51:11.940 --> 01:51:12.940
You're gonna get punched next week.

01:51:12.940 --> 01:51:15.940
But, you know what? That was just a clusterfuck of...

01:51:15.940 --> 01:51:23.940
Ah! No! No! No! Bad song. Bad. Bad. Bad song.

01:51:23.940 --> 01:51:25.940
One. I'm sorry. It was awful.

01:51:25.940 --> 01:51:28.940
And then I thought it was gonna end. I was like, oh thank god.

01:51:28.940 --> 01:51:35.540
back. It came back and I was like no. Wow. Very very bad. I, you know what, me personally

01:51:35.540 --> 01:51:39.300
on, oh and I don't get to go to the last, we gotta go to the same order. Shane, you're

01:51:39.300 --> 01:51:44.460
up next. Okay, my first comment when that song was playing and we didn't have microphones

01:51:44.460 --> 01:51:50.580
on was, wow, I didn't know Inuyasha was over. It sounds like an anime song that I don't

01:51:50.580 --> 01:51:57.980
care about. Um, one, cause I don't understand the love of Japanese singers and how they're

01:51:57.980 --> 01:52:02.980
They're so cool, and Ayumi Hamasaki, and...

01:52:02.980 --> 01:52:03.980
One.

01:52:03.980 --> 01:52:06.980
Alright, well let's see, let's move on.

01:52:06.980 --> 01:52:07.980
Justin!

01:52:07.980 --> 01:52:13.620
Even though it was a complete clusterfuck of a different, like, it went through rap,

01:52:13.620 --> 01:52:17.980
it went through happy J-pop, it went through generic trance, and it went through hard trance,

01:52:17.980 --> 01:52:19.980
I still kinda liked it.

01:52:19.980 --> 01:52:21.980
So I give it a 7.

01:52:21.980 --> 01:52:22.980
Alright.

01:52:22.980 --> 01:52:23.980
Xtavor.

01:52:23.980 --> 01:52:25.980
Damn those gill sellers.

01:52:25.980 --> 01:52:29.980
I got it right that time, right?

01:52:29.980 --> 01:52:33.980
Yeah, you did, but that's not the topic.

01:52:33.980 --> 01:52:37.980
I'm sorry, the song was so boring.

01:52:37.980 --> 01:52:41.980
I love Jamie, so I'm going to give it a 5 just for that.

01:52:41.980 --> 01:52:45.980
John!

01:52:45.980 --> 01:52:49.980
I'll just say that Loki's song was my favorite.

01:52:49.980 --> 01:52:53.980
That's not a number on a scale of 1 to 10.

01:52:53.980 --> 01:52:55.980
I'm a first time guest, so there.

01:52:55.980 --> 01:52:57.980
That is nice. Just pick a number.

01:53:25.980 --> 01:53:31.820
the middle but like not not everything in the middle like the rap in the middle

01:53:31.820 --> 01:53:35.300
I didn't like but I liked like the first two minutes around the beginning I like

01:53:35.300 --> 01:53:39.260
the last two minutes after the rap so like if we could cut like crop the song

01:53:39.260 --> 01:53:43.300
it would be really really good but because it's not cropped I have to give

01:53:43.300 --> 01:53:49.380
it like a seven so low-key you have a it sounded like it to the end of a 2d x

01:53:49.380 --> 01:53:52.580
song I can't think for life me which Voyager

01:53:52.580 --> 01:54:02.580
Big Voyager, okay, yeah, completely ripped those public, I'm sure they're royalty-free samples, they're available on CD somewhere because everybody uses them.

01:54:02.580 --> 01:54:04.580
I have some of them, so I know.

01:54:04.580 --> 01:54:11.580
Alright, kids, get ready to place those votes. Here's a recap of the three songs you can vote for in tonight's cage match.

01:54:11.580 --> 01:54:18.580
Song number one is Cold Storage with Onyx.

01:54:22.920 --> 01:54:28.020
And song number two you can vote for tonight is DJ Sami

01:54:28.020 --> 01:54:35.020
with his Annie Lennox cover of Why.

01:54:35.020 --> 01:54:49.020
And, song number three you can vote for tonight is Hamasaki Ayumi, Fly High, Howl's 2000 mix.

01:54:49.020 --> 01:55:03.020
Place, Vote, Now, did you like how I got the big Voyager clip in there?

01:55:03.020 --> 01:55:04.020
Place, Vote, Now.

01:55:04.020 --> 01:55:09.020
Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.

01:55:09.020 --> 01:55:12.020
Jamie, I'm already going to tell you, your vote doesn't count. I'm sorry to hear you say it.

01:55:12.020 --> 01:55:13.020
Alright.

01:55:13.020 --> 01:55:19.020
Hey, you know what? It kind of reminded me, like parts of that Ayumi song reminded me of like a max Ayumi or something like that.

01:55:19.020 --> 01:55:23.020
You know, because they have the clips of like some hard techno stuff and then it went back into Ayumi.

01:55:23.020 --> 01:55:24.020
It was just kind of weird.

01:55:24.020 --> 01:55:26.020
Yeah, it was interesting.

01:55:26.020 --> 01:55:27.020
It was interesting.

01:55:27.020 --> 01:55:28.020
It was interesting.

01:55:28.020 --> 01:55:32.020
Alright, this is the part of the show where I let Loki talk about what's going on in the sim scene.

01:55:32.020 --> 01:55:39.020
Well, I'm sure there's something going on with TrinityMix 6, but I haven't checked, so it's going on.

01:55:39.020 --> 01:55:44.020
Then there's also the important thing, because we're talking about quality sim files now,

01:55:44.020 --> 01:55:50.020
is actually FoodMix 2, they have a date for it now when it's going to be coming out, September 15th.

01:55:50.020 --> 01:55:59.020
And they've announced some of the compilations they're going to be pulling from diverse systems stuff to silly walker stuff.

01:55:59.020 --> 01:56:11.020
And they're basically, I think they mentioned like D7, which was some really good stuff in there, and then some of the Silly Walker got a mix 3 or something like that. Really good songs.

01:56:11.020 --> 01:56:22.020
So, it'll be interesting. I think they said over 50 songs. 50 new songs. So, I can't wait. It looks to be fun and we'll have to check it out on the 15th.

01:56:22.020 --> 01:56:27.640
Justin, I know you follow the sim scene a little bit too, is there anything you want

01:56:27.640 --> 01:56:28.640
to add?

01:56:28.640 --> 01:56:30.640
Because Loki tends to miss things.

01:56:30.640 --> 01:56:37.500
Yeah, actually one of my favorite personal sim file authors, the DWI Extreme series just

01:56:37.500 --> 01:56:39.180
released one of their new mixes too.

01:56:39.180 --> 01:56:43.500
It was DWI Extreme, Glistening to Infinity.

01:56:43.500 --> 01:56:48.840
Lame name, I know, but it was actually a really good mix of songs, they have some Latin songs,

01:56:48.840 --> 01:56:55.220
They have a bunch of R&B and dance songs, and it's actually a really good mix.

01:56:55.220 --> 01:57:02.040
But the thing is, for this specific release, they're actually making it kind of in the

01:57:02.040 --> 01:57:07.580
groove style, where they put in a bunch of challenge steps that were like, they range

01:57:07.580 --> 01:57:12.360
from fun to bullshit hard, but they turn out a lot better than the stuff the in the groove

01:57:12.360 --> 01:57:15.840
people have, so I recommend it.

01:57:15.840 --> 01:57:25.840
Oh, and my cell's down still. That's good. Thank you for sharing. Thank you for that update.

01:57:25.840 --> 01:57:26.840
They're still dead.

01:57:26.840 --> 01:57:34.840
Yes. In related news, Princess Diana is still dead, just in case you were wondering.

01:57:34.840 --> 01:57:39.840
Princess Di.

01:57:39.840 --> 01:57:41.840
How rude.

01:57:41.840 --> 01:57:58.840
And I would have loved to see, you know, the actual, you know how they always have those, like, funny, witty, you know, subject lines, you know, they're always on the newspapers, you know, the wonderful headlines. I wish, you know, there was a newspaper that put Princess Di, you know, D-I-B, yeah, because that'd be cool.

01:57:58.840 --> 01:58:03.840
You know, you might be really offending somebody who's listening tonight. But isn't that what we were good at doing?

01:58:03.840 --> 01:58:12.840
Well, you know, if I'm offending the princess Di, then they shouldn't, you know, she's probably rolling her grave, you know, hook her up to an alternator. Generate some power that way.

01:58:16.840 --> 01:58:18.840
Let's change the subject, shall we?

01:58:21.840 --> 01:58:26.840
I, I, some folks still wanted to call in on our Skype line.

01:58:26.840 --> 01:58:30.560
So, I'm going to go ahead and open the Skype line back up.

01:58:30.560 --> 01:58:34.360
It's available at www.orangelaungeradio.com.

01:58:34.360 --> 01:58:41.000
Click on interact with us, and you too can join in on the fun here on orangelaungeradio.com.

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:44.400
So I'm going to give them just a couple minutes to get in.

01:58:44.400 --> 01:58:47.020
Now's your chance on the Skype line.

01:58:47.020 --> 01:58:52.600
In the meantime, I wanted to mention this because Rini linked me to this.

01:58:52.600 --> 01:58:53.600
Hold on.

01:58:53.600 --> 01:59:01.200
problems getting in a couple minutes to get in that sounds like you know and

01:59:01.200 --> 01:59:06.680
Nicole Smith boarding a plane you know it's like come on I'm ready for you

01:59:06.680 --> 01:59:19.480
anyway I'm supposed to mention this something that Renee linked me to and I

01:59:19.480 --> 01:59:31.980
I think this came off of the DDR Freak forum somehow, and it's basically linked to on Konami of USA's website for Xtreme 2.

01:59:31.980 --> 01:59:38.480
There's actually an online user agreement, and you can read all these details, and it's basically the blah blah blah blah blahs about the game.

01:59:38.480 --> 01:59:43.480
Well, somewhere in here it mentions in the blah blah blah something about,

01:59:43.480 --> 01:59:50.480
This online game does not have any automatic save feature, and therefore will ask you to save your information to a memory card or hard disk drive.

01:59:50.480 --> 01:59:55.480
So people are saying like, OMG, this game might have a hard disk drive support on it.

01:59:55.480 --> 02:00:04.480
So, I don't know. I tend to think this is just some generic agreement that happens to have Konami's name inserted in there.

02:00:04.480 --> 02:00:09.480
But we'll see. Hey, turn down your speakers, buddy, and you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:00:09.480 --> 02:00:11.480
Yo, Sky, what's up?

02:00:11.480 --> 02:00:13.480
Hey, what's up?

02:00:13.480 --> 02:00:15.480
It's Kuwabara.

02:00:15.480 --> 02:00:21.480
Hello Kuwabara. I'm hearing myself. Can you turn down your speakers or move the headphones or something?

02:00:21.480 --> 02:00:24.480
Sorry, it's a built-in mic. I'm actually five.

02:00:24.480 --> 02:00:31.480
Oh. That's alright. Well, give us your thought because I'm hearing myself, so give us your thought and then we'll respond to it.

02:00:31.480 --> 02:00:33.480
Thought on what?

02:00:33.480 --> 02:00:35.480
Why you're calling in tonight.

02:00:35.480 --> 02:00:46.480
I just wanted to call in, just to talk about stuff, I really like 2DX and stuff, just because, you know, I want to change the subject from ITG and DDR, because, you know, it's starting to piss me off.

02:00:46.480 --> 02:00:53.480
Okay, well, what is it you want to say that's not ITG, DDR-related?

02:00:53.480 --> 02:00:57.480
I don't know, I really love Noria.

02:00:57.480 --> 02:00:59.480
You love what?

02:00:59.480 --> 02:01:00.480
Noria.

02:01:00.480 --> 02:01:03.480
Noria? That's 2DX-related.

02:01:03.480 --> 02:01:14.480
I played a Noria song for you last break.

02:01:14.480 --> 02:01:19.480
What's the thing you like most about 2DX?

02:01:19.480 --> 02:01:23.480
I like 2DX because of the key sounds.

02:01:23.480 --> 02:01:26.480
Wouldn't it be sweet if there was a remix mode?

02:01:26.480 --> 02:01:29.480
Yeah, I'm sure.

02:01:29.480 --> 02:01:34.480
Well, you better get in your final thought because Jamie's getting pissed at me because I didn't answer her call.

02:01:34.480 --> 02:01:35.480
Jinx.

02:01:35.480 --> 02:01:44.480
I'm really pissed off because of BBNAUS and stuff because they're just delaying 10th style because of that and I really want 10th style, you know.

02:01:44.480 --> 02:01:47.480
Why are you ticked off about BBNAUS?

02:01:47.480 --> 02:01:53.480
Because they're delaying 10th style because of it and there are a lot of songs in 10th style that I really want.

02:01:53.480 --> 02:01:55.480
Oh, wait. Can you say that?

02:01:55.480 --> 02:01:56.480
Can you say that?

02:01:56.480 --> 02:01:57.480
Oh, never mind. Okay.

02:01:57.480 --> 02:02:02.480
Okay, nevermind. Okay. Well, it's our turn, dammit!

02:02:02.480 --> 02:02:04.480
Wait a minute, yeah, I'll do it.

02:02:04.480 --> 02:02:06.480
Alright, let me go talk to her, hurry up.

02:02:06.480 --> 02:02:09.480
Who says they're- oh crap, that's loud!

02:02:09.480 --> 02:02:10.480
Sorry.

02:02:10.480 --> 02:02:12.480
Okay, I'll talk really quietly.

02:02:12.480 --> 02:02:17.480
Who said that they're delaying temp style because of Beatmania US?

02:02:17.480 --> 02:02:21.480
Oh, I just thought it up, because, you know, it makes sense, doesn't it?

02:02:21.480 --> 02:02:24.480
Well, don't listen to your brain.

02:02:24.480 --> 02:02:28.480
That's something Konami would do, though. It just makes sense.

02:02:28.480 --> 02:02:29.480
Why would they do that?

02:02:29.480 --> 02:02:30.480
Well, they got a lot of people working there.

02:02:30.480 --> 02:02:33.480
That's not a nice thing.

02:02:33.480 --> 02:02:34.480
Konami's nice.

02:02:34.480 --> 02:02:39.480
Besides, they're working on, they have, you know, the U.S. offices that work on the Mania U.S.,

02:02:39.480 --> 02:02:43.480
and then you have the Japanese offices that work on the Mania 2DX.

02:02:43.480 --> 02:02:48.480
I don't actually think that's how it's working, but I don't think they're delaying anything.

02:02:48.480 --> 02:02:49.480
Don't listen to your brain, you know.

02:02:49.480 --> 02:02:50.480
Oh, yeah, that's right.

02:02:50.480 --> 02:02:51.480
All right.

02:02:51.480 --> 02:02:53.480
Coolabara, I'm gonna go ahead and let you go,

02:02:53.480 --> 02:02:56.480
Thank you for calling in, and have a great day, okay?

02:02:56.480 --> 02:02:57.480
Echo.

02:02:57.480 --> 02:02:58.480
All right.

02:02:58.480 --> 02:02:59.480
Later.

02:02:59.480 --> 02:03:00.480
Later.

02:03:00.480 --> 02:03:01.480
All right.

02:03:01.480 --> 02:03:02.480
So, Skypline's still open.

02:03:02.480 --> 02:03:04.480
DarkSakura, who's probably ticked off on me, but that's all right.

02:03:04.480 --> 02:03:05.480
That guy got in first.

02:03:05.480 --> 02:03:06.480
What can I say?

02:03:06.480 --> 02:03:09.480
Now you know what it's like to be one of our listeners trying to get in on the Skypline.

02:03:09.480 --> 02:03:13.480
If we took a picture just then, we would have an echo image.

02:03:13.480 --> 02:03:16.480
OMG, was that a hint?

02:03:16.480 --> 02:03:18.480
OMG, was that a clue?

02:03:18.480 --> 02:03:19.480
Was that a clue?

02:03:19.480 --> 02:03:22.480
Go back to the freak board.

02:03:22.480 --> 02:03:36.480
Alright, so just because TenStyle is, um, or I'm sorry, just because, sorry, just because BeatMania US is being worked on doesn't mean that TenStyle is not being worked on.

02:03:36.480 --> 02:03:45.480
And it hasn't even been announced yet, so who knows if they're actually even doing it, but the release of a US game would not stop the production of a Japanese game.

02:03:45.480 --> 02:03:48.600
Alright, from the man on the inside himself.

02:03:48.600 --> 02:03:49.960
Anyway, let's go to our skype line.

02:03:49.960 --> 02:03:51.080
Hi, you're on Orangetown's radio.

02:03:53.800 --> 02:03:54.300
Hello?

02:03:55.160 --> 02:03:56.120
Uh, can you hear me?

02:03:56.120 --> 02:03:57.320
Yes, now we can. What's up?

02:03:59.560 --> 02:04:02.280
Oh my god, what a day.

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:06.920
This is the one and only Dark Sakura, for those that may not recognize the voice.

02:04:06.920 --> 02:04:08.440
This is Dark Sakura, ladies and gentlemen.

02:04:09.640 --> 02:04:10.680
Here too, say hi.

02:04:11.240 --> 02:04:11.740
Hello.

02:04:12.360 --> 02:04:12.860
Hi Dan.

02:04:12.860 --> 02:04:17.860
There's a little bit of lag, DarkSakura, so just tell us about your day.

02:04:17.860 --> 02:04:24.860
I spent all day at Classic Gaming Expo looking at a bunch of stuff that I wanted to buy,

02:04:24.860 --> 02:04:32.860
and I found myself actually put into position of translator for some guy at this booth selling a bunch of Famicon,

02:04:32.860 --> 02:04:37.860
and Super Famicon, and Mega Drive games, and PC Engine U-Cards,

02:04:37.860 --> 02:04:42.140
cards, and I actually didn't get to go to any of the panels

02:04:42.140 --> 02:04:44.140
because I was busy drooling at stuff and looking at the

02:04:44.140 --> 02:04:47.460
museum, which actually wasn't as impressive as it was

02:04:47.460 --> 02:04:49.820
before, it's just all the same stuff.

02:04:49.820 --> 02:04:52.820
But they're going to be taking a year off next year and

02:04:52.820 --> 02:04:55.580
coming back in 2007, and hopefully that's going to be

02:04:55.580 --> 02:04:56.860
bigger and better.

02:04:56.860 --> 02:05:00.460
This year was kind of eh, but I got to meet the guys who run

02:05:00.460 --> 02:05:02.580
a retro gaming radio.

02:05:02.580 --> 02:05:03.100
Cool.

02:05:03.100 --> 02:05:06.020
Who are pretty big.

02:05:06.020 --> 02:05:10.420
We actually had a pretty long discussion about Don Bluth.

02:05:10.420 --> 02:05:14.020
Oh, okay.

02:05:14.020 --> 02:05:17.220
We also, uh, I also got to meet, um,

02:05:17.220 --> 02:05:18.760
this person who is

02:05:18.760 --> 02:05:22.980
built basically a miniature Nintendo that runs the Famicom and Nintendo games.

02:05:22.980 --> 02:05:25.700
I took some pictures of that. They'll be up on the site in a few days.

02:05:25.700 --> 02:05:28.680
Is that the same one from E3?

02:05:28.680 --> 02:05:32.900
Um, I don't remember because I don't think I saw him at E3. It was

02:05:32.900 --> 02:05:34.900
Is it called the Messiah system or something?

02:05:34.900 --> 02:05:35.900
Yeah, I think it's the one we played.

02:05:35.900 --> 02:05:36.900
That sounds vaguely familiar.

02:05:36.900 --> 02:05:37.900
The one I played Duck Hunt.

02:05:37.900 --> 02:05:40.900
But I don't remember it supporting Famicom, just the old school Nintendo.

02:05:40.900 --> 02:05:41.900
But maybe they wouldn't have been showing that.

02:05:41.900 --> 02:05:49.900
It's got a Famicom loader on top, like the Famicom was, and then a front loader for the Nintendo games.

02:05:49.900 --> 02:05:53.900
And it also has hookups in back, if you can get a hold of the disc system.

02:05:53.900 --> 02:06:00.900
Oh, so you can hook up like an old school Famicom disc system, so you can play like the original, like, oh, what was that game they based?

02:06:00.900 --> 02:06:01.900
Doki Doki Panic!

02:06:01.900 --> 02:06:03.900
Zelda II was a disc game.

02:06:03.900 --> 02:06:05.900
Doki Doki Panic's the one I always think of.

02:06:05.900 --> 02:06:07.900
So it was the first one.

02:06:07.900 --> 02:06:09.900
Metroid, Kid Icarus.

02:06:09.900 --> 02:06:11.900
Zelda II was a disc game?

02:06:11.900 --> 02:06:13.900
Excitebike, because it had save. Remember Excitebike?

02:06:13.900 --> 02:06:15.900
Excitebike.

02:06:15.900 --> 02:06:17.900
Now Doki Doki Panic.

02:06:17.900 --> 02:06:19.900
This is what pissed me off about Classic Gaming Expo last year.

02:06:19.900 --> 02:06:21.900
Although I had such a great time.

02:06:21.900 --> 02:06:25.900
And I had an especially good time watching Dark Sakura run and hit the button on the bathroom wall.

02:06:25.900 --> 02:06:27.900
But we won't talk about that again.

02:06:27.900 --> 02:06:38.900
One thing that kind of ticked me off about Classic Gaming Expo last year was that there were not a lot of actual classic arcade games. Did they fix that this year, or another disappointment?

02:06:38.900 --> 02:06:43.900
The whole reason behind that, and it makes a lot of sense, is... What's the name of that thing called, Dan?

02:06:43.900 --> 02:06:44.900
California Xtreme.

02:06:44.900 --> 02:06:50.900
California Xtreme, where they... That's basically replacing all of the big, massive arcade of retro games.

02:06:50.900 --> 02:06:56.900
They had more games this year and almost all of them worked.

02:06:56.900 --> 02:07:00.900
They had a millipede, mousetrap, gorf, tempest.

02:07:00.900 --> 02:07:02.900
Dude, mousetrap is awesome.

02:07:02.900 --> 02:07:05.900
Dude, that's why I love my Colecovision.

02:07:05.900 --> 02:07:07.900
The mousetrap and gorf.

02:07:07.900 --> 02:07:10.900
Gorf? Who plays gorf?

02:07:10.900 --> 02:07:14.900
Dude, gorf was my favorite game when the Colecovision was out.

02:07:14.900 --> 02:07:18.900
I was a master at gorf and space fury.

02:07:18.900 --> 02:07:22.900
worked on, I think, a ColecoVision emulator for either the DS or the PSP.

02:07:22.900 --> 02:07:26.900
Really? Yes. Oh, that's kind of cool. Very cool.

02:07:26.900 --> 02:07:30.900
So, what was probably the worst thing

02:07:30.900 --> 02:07:34.900
in your opinion about Classic Gaming Expo, something you needed improving on?

02:07:34.900 --> 02:07:38.900
It just felt kind of empty. What?

02:07:38.900 --> 02:07:42.900
Dan said it was dinky. Well, it was a different hotel this year, right?

02:07:42.900 --> 02:07:46.900
Yeah, it was at the Hyatt and Burlingame.

02:07:46.900 --> 02:07:55.900
We were actually in San Francisco, I think.

02:07:55.900 --> 02:08:00.900
But there were people there who heard of us.

02:08:00.900 --> 02:08:11.900
But I made some contacts, we will be having more on that in the future once I've got something official going on.

02:08:11.900 --> 02:08:21.900
For the people who were there, they were the folks that were really into it. Oh, by the way, there was a new Lego sculpture.

02:08:21.900 --> 02:08:23.900
Of what?

02:08:23.900 --> 02:08:25.900
Pac-Man. I took a picture.

02:08:25.900 --> 02:08:27.900
Oh, that's cool.

02:08:27.900 --> 02:08:34.900
And for the Moby Games thing, Dan got placed number four and got me a T-shirt.

02:08:34.900 --> 02:08:35.900
Oh, cool. Cool.

02:08:35.900 --> 02:08:37.900
For the whole show.

02:08:37.900 --> 02:08:38.900
Oh, wow.

02:08:38.900 --> 02:08:39.900
For the whole show.

02:08:39.900 --> 02:08:40.900
For what game?

02:08:40.900 --> 02:08:45.900
We have to name the screenshot.

02:08:45.900 --> 02:08:49.900
Oh, I remember that thing. Okay. I remember that. I remember that.

02:08:49.900 --> 02:08:56.900
What was the contest they had last year where we all had to play the Stampede on Atari?

02:08:56.900 --> 02:08:58.900
Did they do something like that again this year?

02:08:58.900 --> 02:09:02.900
I think that there was some type of game going on on like a widescreen.

02:09:02.900 --> 02:09:06.900
One thing, Rob, I think that you'll get a kick out of in the museum room.

02:09:06.900 --> 02:09:13.900
They had a Jaguar hooked up onto their projector, and it was Tempest X, which was Tempest 2000.

02:09:19.900 --> 02:09:28.900
Yes, 8-Bit Weapon was back. Unfortunately, I was sort of out of cash because somebody found the core graphics in Strider on the PC Engine Duo.

02:09:28.900 --> 02:09:35.900
So I would have picked up one of their CDs, but I think I still got their card from last year. I meant to contact them.

02:09:35.900 --> 02:09:42.900
And there's also another person there just playing a bunch of game music on a keyboard.

02:09:42.900 --> 02:09:48.900
Oh, that's kind of cool. Just like a bum or somebody who was actually led into the show and doing all this stuff.

02:09:48.900 --> 02:09:50.900
No, just somebody who was part of the show.

02:09:50.900 --> 02:09:51.900
That's cool.

02:09:51.900 --> 02:10:02.900
There was also, for the people who were there, the Atari people were back, of course Moby Games, the Intellivision folks were there.

02:10:03.900 --> 02:10:06.900
Still whoring out that Intellivision collection from like three years ago?

02:10:06.900 --> 02:10:24.900
Yep. There's also a couple guys there who were selling MVS cartridges. For anyone who doesn't know, the MVS cartridges are the Neo Geo games and homemade JAMA units to play them on.

02:10:24.900 --> 02:10:27.900
And sell them like, you know, a-

02:10:30.900 --> 02:10:32.900
Whoa. Whoa, whoa.

02:10:33.900 --> 02:10:36.900
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

02:10:36.900 --> 02:10:40.900
Whoa, Jamie, hold up, hold up. Jamie, your voice went like crazy there for a minute.

02:10:40.900 --> 02:10:42.900
You sounded like an evil lord, a demon.

02:10:42.900 --> 02:10:45.900
From like, from like an Atari 2600 game.

02:10:45.900 --> 02:10:47.900
We gotta save that clip for the next intro.

02:10:47.900 --> 02:10:49.900
That was crazy.

02:10:49.900 --> 02:10:52.900
Start over again with that paragraph, Jamie.

02:10:52.900 --> 02:11:01.020
Okay, um I there who the selling a basically anything any see practically it was a

02:11:01.660 --> 02:11:07.820
Duo our door our duo our ex core graphics a bunch of turbo graphics

02:11:08.460 --> 02:11:10.460
turbo turbo duo games

02:11:10.900 --> 02:11:17.460
PC engine duo games arcade cards you name it. He had a bunch of good stuff. We picked up like five HuCard games

02:11:18.220 --> 02:11:20.220
mm-hmm

02:11:20.220 --> 02:11:49.220
But his other main thing though is that he, he mods consoles, he actually has basically regionless duo that'll sell, because the one thing is that the duo, the CD will read any region and has no problem with replicas, however the cards themselves are not universal and there's not any real good adapter, but he's got, he's modded a universal system for it.

02:11:49.220 --> 02:11:57.220
And he does video mods, super guns, jamma units. He actually has made this really tiny jamma unit for MVS cartridges.

02:11:57.220 --> 02:11:58.220
Oh, cool.

02:11:58.220 --> 02:12:02.220
I don't know if an explanation of those came through, but the MVS cartridges are the Neo Geo games.

02:12:02.220 --> 02:12:04.220
Huh.

02:12:04.220 --> 02:12:10.220
I had wished that there were, you know, the modified cartridges to play on the AVS systems.

02:12:10.220 --> 02:12:11.220
Hmm.

02:12:11.220 --> 02:12:15.220
Yeah, sorry. Dan's over here correcting me.

02:12:15.220 --> 02:12:16.220
Okay.

02:12:16.220 --> 02:12:27.220
Also, again, the television people were there, like I said. The people with the massive Atari stuff were there. Expensive Lynx games, oh my god.

02:12:27.220 --> 02:12:36.220
But the booth that I liked the best, I'd have to say, was the guy from Japan just selling stuff.

02:12:36.220 --> 02:12:38.220
Oh, there's just a random guy from Japan selling stuff?

02:12:38.220 --> 02:12:48.220
He was selling Famicon, Super Nintendo, um, cue cards, um, all kinds of stuff that were like five games for ten dollars.

02:12:48.220 --> 02:13:05.220
So I picked up Final Fantasy II on the Famicon, uh, Mappy Land in the box on the Famicon, Final Fantasy V for Super Famicon, Puyo Puyo for the Mega Drive, and, uh, Legend of the Valkyrie for PC Engine.

02:13:05.220 --> 02:13:07.540
that was ten bucks for all that

02:13:07.540 --> 02:13:10.820
ten dollars you can make a killing for them and i think you

02:13:10.820 --> 02:13:13.140
and i had a price tag of twenty dollars on it

02:13:13.140 --> 02:13:16.020
well you can make a killing for them on ebay

02:13:16.020 --> 02:13:19.940
yeah but i actually want to play it

02:13:19.940 --> 02:13:22.260
all right we'll see

02:13:22.260 --> 02:13:24.600
who knows maybe i'll get you know

02:13:24.600 --> 02:13:28.220
fed up in one of those will become a prize for one of our loyal listeners

02:13:28.220 --> 02:13:32.820
ooh that'll be cool all right sounds good

02:13:32.820 --> 02:13:34.620
stop teasing him

02:13:34.620 --> 02:13:40.620
Alright, well we're going to go ahead and we'll hear more about Classic Amy Exwell on this week's podcast.

02:13:40.620 --> 02:13:41.620
Can I hang up on me?

02:13:41.620 --> 02:13:46.620
I'm not going to hang up on you, but we have to get to the FUs of the week and the other stuff too in a break.

02:13:46.620 --> 02:13:47.620
Hello?

02:13:47.620 --> 02:13:48.620
Because I really got to go to the bathroom.

02:13:48.620 --> 02:13:50.620
That was crap.

02:13:50.620 --> 02:13:52.620
No, it's still...

02:13:52.620 --> 02:13:56.620
Hello? Are you even listening to me? Hello?

02:13:56.620 --> 02:13:57.620
Is she there?

02:13:57.620 --> 02:13:58.620
Hello?

02:13:58.620 --> 02:13:59.620
Whoa, hi.

02:13:59.620 --> 02:14:03.620
Whoa, she went into evil warlord voice there again for a minute.

02:14:03.620 --> 02:14:07.620
Anything else you want to say to the listeners before we go?

02:14:07.620 --> 02:14:10.620
Um, words.

02:14:10.620 --> 02:14:11.620
All right.

02:14:11.620 --> 02:14:12.620
Lobster.

All right, have a good one, DarkSockGirl. We'll see you back for the podcast.

02:14:16.620 --> 02:14:18.620

02:14:18.620 --> 02:14:21.620
Later. Bye.

02:14:21.620 --> 02:14:23.620
She beat me to the hang-up button.

02:14:23.620 --> 02:14:24.620
I like that.

02:14:24.620 --> 02:14:26.620
Yeah, that was weird.

02:14:26.620 --> 02:14:29.620
Like, when she was, I am the evil Lord Satan.

02:14:29.620 --> 02:14:31.620
Like, that was really scary.

02:14:31.620 --> 02:14:38.300
out all right anyway we're gonna go to a break because I have to pee and then

02:14:38.300 --> 02:14:40.940

So we'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio after this.

I'll just get a good one

02:15:25.820 --> 02:15:28.380
Good and bad, bad, bad, bad, bad

02:15:28.380 --> 02:15:30.380
Let me go, let me go, let me go

02:16:28.380 --> 02:16:30.380
Uhh...

02:16:30.380 --> 02:16:32.760
I'm sick, dream of a life

02:16:32.760 --> 02:16:34.760
I still have no life

02:16:34.760 --> 02:16:36.760
I'm sick

02:16:36.760 --> 02:16:38.760
Uhh...

02:16:38.760 --> 02:16:40.760
I'm sick

02:16:40.760 --> 02:16:42.760
Uhh...

02:16:42.760 --> 02:16:44.760
Uhh...

02:16:44.760 --> 02:16:46.760
Uhh...

02:16:46.760 --> 02:16:48.760
Uhh...

02:16:48.760 --> 02:16:50.760
Uhh...

02:16:50.760 --> 02:16:52.760
Uhh...

02:16:52.760 --> 02:16:54.760
Uhh...

02:16:54.760 --> 02:16:56.760
Oh

02:17:24.760 --> 02:17:30.760
Can't be alone

02:17:36.760 --> 02:17:39.760
You don't have to believe in a Hollywood girl

02:17:39.760 --> 02:17:41.760
But it's all solid policies

02:17:41.760 --> 02:17:44.760
You wanted to do, so you have got this

02:17:44.760 --> 02:17:47.760
And you know that

02:17:47.760 --> 02:17:50.760
You wanted to lose in a Hollywood town

02:17:50.760 --> 02:17:53.760
To be a soul that you always need

02:17:53.760 --> 02:17:57.760
But I can't listen to my own words tonight

02:17:57.760 --> 02:18:00.260
I'm just watching you and I'm sad

02:18:00.260 --> 02:18:03.260
So I don't mind that I made a start

02:18:03.260 --> 02:18:09.260
To you everywhere I thought you were all right

02:18:09.260 --> 02:18:13.260
You are the sky

02:18:13.260 --> 02:18:15.260
I'm just watching you and I'm sad

02:18:15.260 --> 02:18:18.260
You're everything you think I am

02:18:18.260 --> 02:18:20.260
Everything you think I am

02:18:20.260 --> 02:18:22.760
I can't believe that I'm hiding

02:18:22.760 --> 02:18:25.760
I need a part of you on my own

02:18:25.760 --> 02:18:28.260
I will leave you and leave you

02:18:28.260 --> 02:18:31.260
Though you would last me the most

02:18:31.260 --> 02:18:34.260
I'm not the kind that I need to stay

02:18:34.260 --> 02:18:35.260
I'm falling down

02:19:05.260 --> 02:19:09.260
I am the Roma, six-legged Roma,

02:19:09.260 --> 02:19:13.260
Lived until the captain keeps the streets away.

02:19:13.260 --> 02:19:17.260
I'm Romeo, Juliet.

02:19:17.260 --> 02:19:21.260
I'm Romeo, Juliet.

02:19:21.260 --> 02:19:25.260
I'm Romeo, Juliet.

02:19:25.260 --> 02:19:28.260
I'm Romeo, Juliet.

02:19:28.260 --> 02:19:31.260
I'll scream for you, right to heaven.

02:19:31.260 --> 02:19:35.260
And time was made for passion

02:19:35.260 --> 02:19:39.260
The only thing I know is faith

02:19:39.260 --> 02:19:43.260
And fear is a distraction

02:19:43.260 --> 02:19:47.260
Fear is a distraction

02:19:55.260 --> 02:19:59.260
I am a robot

02:20:29.260 --> 02:20:34.260
I found this strange attraction

02:20:34.260 --> 02:20:38.260
It was made for you, my dear

02:20:38.260 --> 02:20:41.260
It was made for my show

02:20:41.260 --> 02:20:44.260
The only thing I know is that

02:20:44.260 --> 02:20:48.260
I could use that inspiration

02:20:48.260 --> 02:20:53.260
To use that inspiration

02:20:53.260 --> 02:21:15.140
Why, why did you have to go away?

02:21:15.140 --> 02:21:17.140
It's always hard to say

02:21:17.140 --> 02:21:22.140
It keeps on going over, over you

02:21:22.140 --> 02:21:26.140
Tell me was it really true romance

02:21:26.140 --> 02:21:29.140
Or just fantasy

02:21:29.140 --> 02:21:32.140
If you believe what we're still through

02:21:32.140 --> 02:21:35.140
You're hanging out with someone new

02:21:35.140 --> 02:21:37.140
Still you're in my heart baby

02:21:37.140 --> 02:21:40.140
It's my heart, always in my heart

02:21:40.140 --> 02:21:42.140
You never leave my heart

02:21:42.140 --> 02:21:46.140
Tell me, tell you in my heart, beat down in my heart

02:21:46.140 --> 02:21:50.140
Fill me with ecstasy

02:21:55.140 --> 02:21:58.140
Oh baby, no baby

02:21:58.140 --> 02:22:01.140
Can't take you down

02:22:01.140 --> 02:22:04.140
Was it just a fantasy?

02:22:04.140 --> 02:22:07.140
What I've done to feel your reality?

02:22:07.140 --> 02:22:10.140
Oh baby, can't you just see

02:22:10.140 --> 02:22:16.140
Then I can't go on, leave it without you

02:22:16.140 --> 02:22:20.140
Till, till you rip my heart, never leave my heart

02:22:20.140 --> 02:22:22.140
Now it's forevermore

02:22:22.140 --> 02:22:26.140
Till, till you rip my heart, always in my heart

02:22:26.140 --> 02:22:30.140
When will I ever be free?

02:22:30.140 --> 02:22:41.820
After this song, we'll be having a Let Them Move marathon.

02:22:41.820 --> 02:22:42.820
Noooooo!

john and justin went in the front room to go watch television because i guess

02:23:27.440 --> 02:23:32.600
that's more interesting than the show. No, there's a certain show that John has to watch

02:23:32.600 --> 02:23:36.880
every week, and I'm sure a lot of you out there are no different, although you folks

02:23:36.880 --> 02:23:41.600
should consider investing in a VCR or TiVo or something.

02:23:41.600 --> 02:23:44.800
I was reading here about Dancing Stage Max.

02:23:44.800 --> 02:23:48.080
What's up with Dancing Stage Max? I know there was a little news on Dancing Stage Max this

02:23:48.080 --> 02:23:49.080
week, so what's up with that?

02:23:49.080 --> 02:23:55.320
There's a bit more now because they've made it some games convention or whatever. It was

02:23:55.320 --> 02:23:57.400
In Europe, they've got some more stuff.

02:23:57.400 --> 02:24:04.640
They have songs by the artists V, Hip2Hip.

No, she never sang that song, though, did she?

02:24:23.680 --> 02:24:24.360
It says Labelle.

02:24:24.360 --> 02:24:26.360
I am just telling you what it says.

02:24:26.360 --> 02:24:28.360
Who sang that song originally?

02:24:28.360 --> 02:24:30.360
Adam Ant with Goody Two Shoes.

02:24:30.360 --> 02:24:32.360
Oh, that's kind of interesting.

I love this song. Hold on, I have a clip of this song.

02:24:38.360 --> 02:24:40.360
I love this song.

02:24:44.360 --> 02:24:46.360
And it will have the video from what I understand.

02:24:46.360 --> 02:24:49.080

was it five, six, seven, eight? I just know their song Tragedy because my,

02:25:24.960 --> 02:25:29.000
my, now, I've, you know, I'm a gay guy myself, so I don't make fun of other gay guys

02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:30.600
very often, but I used to live with a

02:25:30.600 --> 02:25:35.400
flaming homosexual, okay? Flaming homosexual, love him to death, he was a

02:25:35.400 --> 02:25:39.280
flaming homosexual, and he used to listen to that song and do the little dance and everything with his solo.

02:25:39.280 --> 02:25:43.240
Um, Chain Reaction, Christina Milan with Dip It Low,

02:25:43.240 --> 02:25:44.240
Awesome.

02:25:44.240 --> 02:25:45.240
Dip it low.

02:25:45.240 --> 02:25:46.240
Dip it, dip it low.

02:25:46.240 --> 02:25:47.240
I like my gallows.

02:25:47.240 --> 02:25:53.560
Vic Reeves with Dizzy, Mile with Drop the Pressure, Daniel Bedingfield with Friday,

02:25:53.560 --> 02:25:55.880
and Carl Douglas with Kung Fu Fighting.

02:25:55.880 --> 02:25:56.880
Yes.

02:25:56.880 --> 02:25:59.400
And then they've got some more here.

02:25:59.400 --> 02:26:05.240
Looks like in the demo or the preliminary song list they mentioned these words, Natasha

02:26:05.240 --> 02:26:09.360
Bedingfield, Michael, Franz Bernett, in the middle Sugar Babes, Goody Two Shoes, Adam

02:26:09.360 --> 02:26:23.360
My question about You Sexy Thing, is it that song they always hear in the commercial, you sexy, sexy thing, you sexy, because that would be horrible.

02:26:39.360 --> 02:26:43.360
So, that's what we've got there. Yeah.

02:26:43.360 --> 02:26:46.360
All right. Sounds good. Thank you for that update on what's going on over there.

02:26:46.360 --> 02:26:49.360
Oh, and of course, you know, Dancing Stage Mario Mix is coming.

02:26:49.360 --> 02:26:52.360
Yeah, you know, DDR with Mario is a game we haven't really talked about a whole lot lately.

02:26:52.360 --> 02:26:58.360
I know it came out in Japan to this big...not...the DDR fans, anyway, in America, really.

02:26:58.360 --> 02:27:03.360
You know, people usually import their DDRs from Japan, but I haven't really heard of anybody importing Mario.

02:27:03.360 --> 02:27:07.360
So nobody's really been going crazy over it. How do you think that game's going to do over here?

02:27:07.360 --> 02:27:11.360
I haven't really heard a lot of buzz about this game.

02:27:11.360 --> 02:27:12.360
I don't know.

02:27:12.360 --> 02:27:18.360
And GameCube's a sinking ship right now, especially after...

02:27:18.360 --> 02:27:22.360
Please Nintendo fanboys, don't start flaming me because I love Nintendo dearly.

02:27:22.360 --> 02:27:24.360
I love Nintendo.

02:27:24.360 --> 02:27:26.360
But they fucked up that Zelda thing.

02:27:26.360 --> 02:27:29.360
Come on, pushing back Zelda to 2006, come on.

02:27:29.360 --> 02:27:30.360
It was pretty dumb.

02:27:30.360 --> 02:27:31.360
They fucked that up.

02:27:31.360 --> 02:27:35.360
So a lot of people are just like done with Nintendo for right now.

02:27:35.360 --> 02:27:50.360
In fact, if you're running, if you look at the poll right now going on at orangeonsrader.com, I don't think the Nintendo screwed up result is winning, but a significant amount of people have been answering that, that way, so it's kind of, um, I don't know, interesting.

02:27:50.360 --> 02:27:52.360
Yeah.

02:27:52.360 --> 02:28:01.360
I don't know. Uh, really, you know, speaking on the rental side of things, nobody carries the GameCube anymore. Nobody.

02:28:01.360 --> 02:28:13.360
The stuff they release for it, it's really kid-based games like Mario Superstar Baseball or Mario Strikers, which is coming out because everybody loves soccer or football, however you want to call it.

02:28:13.360 --> 02:28:17.360
But, um, just, I don't know.

02:28:17.360 --> 02:28:25.360
Of course, I've got the mandatory, fuck you, Sky, you hate Nintendo and I hate you, coming from the chatroom. I don't hate Nintendo.

02:28:25.360 --> 02:28:28.840
I have not stopped playing Meteos for, like, the past two months.

02:28:28.840 --> 02:28:33.760
I have... I have a huge... I'm squeening like a little girl over Nintendogs, which is coming

02:28:33.760 --> 02:28:34.640
out Tuesday.

02:28:34.640 --> 02:28:38.840
I don't even freaking like dogs that much. I've never owned a dog in my life. The only

02:28:38.840 --> 02:28:43.540
dog I ever liked was my grandma's Dash Hunt. But I am buying Nintendogs because I'll be

02:28:43.540 --> 02:28:47.400
damned if that wasn't the cutest game I've seen in, like, five years. So don't tell me

02:28:47.400 --> 02:28:51.160
I hate Nintendo. I love Nintendo. They just... they really fucked up Zelda. They really,

02:28:51.160 --> 02:28:52.200
really fucked that up.

02:28:52.200 --> 02:29:12.200
Really? And, uh, this whole thing with the revolution, we still haven't heard shit about it, and they're even talking about me releasing it the fall of 2006. Wow, that's not gonna fucking suck. Unless it's, like, super revolutionary, which I highly doubt that. But we'll see.

02:29:12.200 --> 02:29:16.480
Who wants to see the

02:29:16.480 --> 02:29:20.000
winner of tonight's cage match? You want to know tonight's weiner

02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:23.080
for the tonight's cage match? He's not the only other person in here.

02:29:23.080 --> 02:29:26.240
There were a freaking ton of votes in tonight's cage match.

02:29:26.240 --> 02:29:31.920
Ton of votes. Not a single vote for DJ Sammy, which pisses me the fuck off.

02:29:31.920 --> 02:29:35.680
So next week you are getting another

02:29:35.680 --> 02:29:39.120
booty song. You're getting something along the lines of Camel Toe

02:29:39.120 --> 02:29:42.600
or what was another booty song I put in? Milkshake?

02:29:42.600 --> 02:29:48.060
Milkshake? Put it in my mouth? All those songs I've put in KJ Smash 4, you're getting another one of those next week

02:29:48.060 --> 02:29:51.540
because I'm pissed off that not a single person voted for DJ Sammy.

02:29:51.540 --> 02:29:57.540
Suck it. So anyway, it came down to the other two songs. It was actually very, very close.

02:29:57.540 --> 02:30:01.220
A lot of votes, but a couple votes did sway it

02:30:01.220 --> 02:30:04.620
towards a two-week win

02:30:04.620 --> 02:30:07.980
for Cold Storage with Onyx.

02:30:07.980 --> 02:30:10.980
I should put my backup songs in more often.

02:30:10.980 --> 02:30:13.980
Two weeks winning their cold storage with Onyx.

02:30:13.980 --> 02:30:16.980
Congratulations, Loki, you bastard.

02:30:16.980 --> 02:30:19.980
I don't have to pick a song next week. That's reward enough for me.

02:30:19.980 --> 02:30:22.980
So next week you get a booty song from me because I'm pissed.

02:30:22.980 --> 02:30:27.980
And I'm sure DarkSakura's not happy either, so she'll dig into her archives of...

02:30:27.980 --> 02:30:31.980
...nerd music and find something.

02:30:31.980 --> 02:30:34.980
How else do you explain MC Chris? That's his nerd music.

02:30:34.980 --> 02:30:42.980
Nobody else gets MC Chris, but nerds. So, I'm calling her music nerd music, but with love and respect, of course.

02:30:43.980 --> 02:30:53.980
Alright. Anyway, we're going to get into the FUs of the week. It's that time of the show where we get a little bit angsty, and we do the FUs of the week.

02:30:53.980 --> 02:30:59.980
of the week. So, this is the part where I would usually ask DarkStalker, why is it that

02:30:59.980 --> 02:31:04.460
we do the FUs every single week? And typically she would give us an answer, something along

02:31:04.460 --> 02:31:19.460
the lines of grr, argh. Alright, as a reminder boys and girls, if you have an FU of the week

02:31:19.460 --> 02:31:27.260
want to send in, you can submit us an F.U. by joining our chat room, www.orangeloungeradio.com,

02:31:27.260 --> 02:31:32.980
and clicking on chat, and you can send me a private message, and we will read your F.U.s,

02:31:32.980 --> 02:31:37.860
but may I take this opportunity, since Jamie isn't here to fill this space right now, to

02:31:37.860 --> 02:31:39.380
give you guys some reminders.

02:31:39.380 --> 02:31:45.680
We do not give F.U.s of a personal nature, unless it's like mom, dad, because we've all

02:31:45.680 --> 02:31:46.720
been angsty teens.

02:31:46.720 --> 02:31:54.720
We do those, and if it's somebody we don't know, but if you're flaming somebody in the community specifically, we usually don't like that unless it's like Jack Thompson or something.

02:31:54.720 --> 02:31:55.720
Or me.

02:31:55.720 --> 02:31:57.720
We all hate him. Or Loki. We let you flame Loki.

02:31:57.720 --> 02:32:02.720
But we don't like to flame people that aren't here to defend themselves, so those are always off limits.

02:32:03.720 --> 02:32:09.720
And, uh, no racist FUs, unless they're really funny.

02:32:10.720 --> 02:32:13.720
Because that's the only time we'll let them in, is if they're really funny.

02:32:13.720 --> 02:32:19.720
Alright, let's see, actually I have a private message from DarkSakura, so maybe she does have some FUs.

02:32:19.720 --> 02:32:22.720
Here we go, she would like to say, Fuck my hip hurting!

02:32:22.720 --> 02:32:27.720
And fuck the speed limit, which I broke by at least 20 miles.

02:32:27.720 --> 02:32:31.720
And fuck not buying a Duo RX.

02:32:31.720 --> 02:32:34.720
So those are DarkSakura's FUs of the week. I think she's still typing.

02:32:34.720 --> 02:32:36.720
Oh no, here's another one.

02:32:36.720 --> 02:32:40.720
And lastly, I'm waiting for this, DarkSakura's last FU.

02:32:40.720 --> 02:32:47.720
FU did the internet being slow, and FU did the big buffer, the 30 seconds between when we talk and when you guys actually hear it.

02:32:47.720 --> 02:32:53.720
We're waiting. Oh, she's typing a big, long sentence here because it's taken a while to get it.

02:32:53.720 --> 02:32:56.720
We'll just enjoy the Silent Hill 2 music here for a little bit.

02:33:00.720 --> 02:33:05.720
Ah, here it is. Fuck being jacked up on Vicodin and unable to drive.

02:33:05.720 --> 02:33:10.720
And Dark Sakura? Yes, the Coleco emulator was on the DS.

02:33:10.720 --> 02:33:11.720
It was alright.

02:33:11.720 --> 02:33:14.720
Now it's time for Loki's FUs!

02:33:16.720 --> 02:33:19.720
You know, I really have one that sticks pretty strong with me.

02:33:19.720 --> 02:33:24.720
Um, there was this fucking white trash, I don't even know what you would call them,

02:33:24.720 --> 02:33:28.720
driving this piece of shit car that was smoking like L.A., you know?

02:33:28.720 --> 02:33:33.720
Just driving down the street, nearly trying to hit my car as he's weaving through traffic.

02:33:33.720 --> 02:33:37.940
And then the fucker stops in the middle of the fucking road just stops

02:33:38.640 --> 02:33:40.640
So I'm sitting there going

02:33:40.940 --> 02:33:42.840
Because the fucking they flips me off

02:33:42.840 --> 02:33:49.160
So then he finally turns the you know pulls over and then I flip him off and honk my horn in make you know

02:33:49.860 --> 02:33:56.500
You know comments like fucking get off the road you piece of shit, you know stuff like that our listeners speakers. Thank you for that

02:33:57.460 --> 02:34:00.900
Well, they had to you have to understand that I was yelling very loud

02:34:00.900 --> 02:34:09.900
So, y'know, I was trying to convey that, because I said, y'know, I yelled, y'know, you fucking piece of shit, it doesn't quite, y'know, the same effect.

02:34:09.900 --> 02:34:24.900
Anyways, um, and then fuck you too, the fact that I've still got drive, I have my fiance around everywhere, because that kinda sucks, and um, I still need a picture of me doing this show for a stupid magazine thing.

02:34:24.900 --> 02:34:25.900
I found all my batteries, I can take a picture.

02:34:25.900 --> 02:34:26.900
Okay, cool!

02:34:26.900 --> 02:34:27.900
Yes, alright.

02:34:27.900 --> 02:34:28.900
That's all I have.

02:34:28.900 --> 02:34:29.900
We'll pose pictures later.

02:34:29.900 --> 02:34:33.900
I'm just fucking to Jack Thompson because it's fun to say that.

02:34:34.900 --> 02:34:35.900
Alright.

02:34:37.900 --> 02:34:38.900
My turn.

02:34:43.900 --> 02:34:54.900
I would like to give a big F.U. to getting sick and an F.U. to Southwest Airlines for their little hotbeds of viruses they call airplanes

02:34:54.900 --> 02:34:58.200
and the fact that I caught a sinus infection and F you to the fact that I

02:34:58.200 --> 02:35:00.040
didn't go to the doctor for a few days

02:35:00.040 --> 02:35:04.240
and F you to my allergy to amoxicillin because apparently amoxicillin is the

02:35:04.240 --> 02:35:05.520
best thing to take for this stuff

02:35:05.520 --> 02:35:09.000
but if I take amoxicillin I break out in a big rash and I look like

02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:12.440
freaky rash boy so I can't... Stop laughing!

02:35:12.440 --> 02:35:17.320
Why are you laughing at that? Why do you show up at the next DDR tournament as freaky rash boy?

02:35:17.320 --> 02:35:20.440
No, because they say if I do that too much I might die so I can't take

02:35:20.440 --> 02:35:24.560
penicillin like ever. Okay, a really good tournament then.

02:35:24.560 --> 02:35:32.860
Anyway, so, an F.U. to the nasal spray I have being a brand copay because brands are more

02:35:32.860 --> 02:35:34.200
expensive than generics.

02:35:34.200 --> 02:35:38.160
And that's it, that's all my F.U.s of the week, I'm really not that angry, because I've

02:35:38.160 --> 02:35:40.260
been sick all week, I haven't had time to get angry.

02:35:40.260 --> 02:35:42.260
So we're gonna go to Justin!

02:35:42.260 --> 02:35:46.620
Hello, uh, hmm, what can I say, oh yeah!

02:35:46.620 --> 02:35:51.380
My F.U.s are kinda tied in to Jamie's oddly, uh, F.U. to my hip hurting, because I have

02:35:51.380 --> 02:35:55.780
a hit problem and it really has been hurting for like a month now and I don't know what

02:35:55.780 --> 02:36:03.780
to do. Um, and also tied into Jamie F U to female drivers because they keep trying to

02:36:03.780 --> 02:36:09.580
hit me when I'm on the freeway and that's kind of annoying. Now, uh, I can understand

02:36:09.580 --> 02:36:13.980
if you need to get somewhere fast, but don't go in the slow lane, keep in the fast lane

02:36:13.980 --> 02:36:19.580
and stay there please. Had one driving today, doing her hair and makeup while driving. Oh

02:36:19.580 --> 02:36:20.580
Oh my god.

02:36:20.580 --> 02:36:21.580
Fucking suck.

02:36:21.580 --> 02:36:26.380
My friend keeps on, uh, as soon as she's trying to go to school in the morning, she always

02:36:26.380 --> 02:36:31.700
takes like a left turn, and every single day the same woman cuts her off so she can do

02:36:31.700 --> 02:36:33.020
her makeup.

02:36:33.020 --> 02:36:35.100
It's ridiculous.

02:36:35.100 --> 02:36:36.820
And that's about it.

02:36:36.820 --> 02:36:42.540
Oh wow, Mikolatov gets back just in time from Taco Bell to give his FUs the week.

02:36:42.540 --> 02:36:43.900
Okay, I want music.

02:36:43.900 --> 02:36:45.300
This is a music cover.

02:36:45.300 --> 02:36:46.300
This is your music.

02:36:46.300 --> 02:36:47.300
What is it?

02:36:47.300 --> 02:36:48.860
It's Help Me, Dr. Dick by Erotic.

02:36:48.860 --> 02:36:52.220
I used to have, like, an actual almost music that you would play.

02:36:52.220 --> 02:36:53.260
Really? What do you want?

02:36:53.260 --> 02:36:54.560
It was in a karaoke song.

02:36:54.560 --> 02:36:58.860
Oh, put the new one from, um, Happy Sky, the one that's in French.

02:36:58.860 --> 02:37:00.660
Jesus Christ, what's the name of it?

02:37:00.660 --> 02:37:02.460
Or you'll get an F.U.

02:37:02.460 --> 02:37:06.260
Just, like, Tom, Piz, Sport, I don't know how to say it.

02:37:07.060 --> 02:37:10.460
How about you just do your F.U.s and stop fighting like a little bitch?

02:37:10.460 --> 02:37:11.860
Because that's my F.U.

02:37:11.860 --> 02:37:12.760
It's for us.

02:37:12.760 --> 02:37:14.460
Okay, anyway, I don't really care.

02:37:14.460 --> 02:37:15.260
Um...

02:37:15.260 --> 02:37:16.660
Oh, this is Twin Amadeus.

02:37:16.660 --> 02:37:17.460
Sorry.

02:37:17.460 --> 02:37:18.160
Oh, whatever.

02:37:18.160 --> 02:37:21.440
You get this. Deal with it.

02:37:21.440 --> 02:37:25.500
Want to be funny if I don't have any FUs?

02:37:25.500 --> 02:37:31.040
FU to Medios for being way too addictive.

02:37:31.040 --> 02:37:32.560
FU

02:37:32.560 --> 02:37:33.540
to

02:37:33.540 --> 02:37:34.800
pump it up

02:37:34.800 --> 02:37:37.280
for PS2 because

02:37:37.280 --> 02:37:40.720
unlocking songs is way too hard to do on that game.

02:37:40.720 --> 02:37:47.720
FU to work, because I hate you.

02:37:47.720 --> 02:37:50.720
And... that's about it.

02:37:50.720 --> 02:37:52.720
But I have an interesting little story real quick.

02:37:52.720 --> 02:37:55.720
We went to Taco Bell and the guy was there, and he's actually hot.

02:37:55.720 --> 02:37:57.720
The drive-thru guy.

02:37:57.720 --> 02:38:01.720
And his name's on the receipt, but there's five names, so I don't know which one he is.

02:38:01.720 --> 02:38:03.720
He could be Christine.

02:38:05.720 --> 02:38:06.720
Fag.

02:38:06.720 --> 02:38:08.720
Or Oleg, or Freddy, or Tim.

02:38:08.720 --> 02:38:10.720
But probably Christine.

02:38:10.720 --> 02:38:13.720
And F you to MeekleTalk for not offering to pick me up a pizza.

02:38:13.720 --> 02:38:15.720
Because that's the only thing I like at Taco Bell, is Pizza Hut.

02:38:15.720 --> 02:38:18.220
You didn't... You should have said something.

02:38:18.220 --> 02:38:20.220
Nah, I'm just kidding. It's alright.

02:38:20.220 --> 02:38:22.220
Alright.

02:38:22.220 --> 02:38:28.220
Let's go to the next FUs, which will be the ones from our chat room.

02:38:28.220 --> 02:38:30.220
Yay.

02:38:30.220 --> 02:38:31.220
Dark Knight would like to say,

02:38:31.220 --> 02:38:33.220
An FU to gas prices.

02:38:33.220 --> 02:38:35.220
Quote The Dark Knight Nevermore.

02:38:35.220 --> 02:38:39.220
Oh, but FU to work and being broke as hell.

02:38:39.220 --> 02:38:41.220
Misty would like to say,

02:38:41.220 --> 02:38:42.220
A private message to me.

02:38:42.220 --> 02:38:45.220
That wasn't an FU. Sorry guys.

02:38:45.220 --> 02:38:46.620
Oh wait, no, there it is. I'm sorry.

02:38:46.620 --> 02:38:49.820
I didn't recognize it because it didn't start with FU2.

02:38:49.820 --> 02:38:50.420
It says,

02:38:50.420 --> 02:38:55.720
You people should be lucky that I'm not so angsty because I went to Six Flags today.

02:38:55.720 --> 02:38:59.820
FU to the max too at Six Flags having dusty ass pads.

02:38:59.820 --> 02:39:06.520
Thank Leetness I managed to own a minute with 29 greats and one miss in sandals even.

02:39:06.520 --> 02:39:07.120
Breenie says,

02:39:07.120 --> 02:39:09.120
An FU to learning to drive.

02:39:09.120 --> 02:39:15.120
Enough said. An FU to all the IRC chat users who want us to stop advertising that one channel.

02:39:15.120 --> 02:39:22.120
it

02:39:22.120 --> 02:39:26.760
with acknowledging it which channel take every inside joke from the past five

02:39:26.760 --> 02:39:29.640
episodes of orders on radio combine it in the one name and that's the name of

02:39:29.640 --> 02:39:30.680
the channel

02:39:30.680 --> 02:39:31.860
well so

02:39:31.860 --> 02:39:34.520
oregon trail

02:39:34.520 --> 02:39:38.720
asshole what else at all of it

02:39:38.720 --> 02:39:41.960
to mirror and by the way the whole chair of the state at the end of the song but

02:39:41.960 --> 02:39:43.140
you just feel

02:39:43.140 --> 02:39:46.260
Jamiro says, F you to school starting in about three days.

02:39:46.260 --> 02:39:49.300
Oh, and Jack Thompson because MPQ said so.

02:39:49.300 --> 02:39:51.580
And Spider Stomp.

02:39:51.580 --> 02:39:56.120
Sakurina says, F you to myself for whoring old jokes in the chat room.

02:39:56.120 --> 02:39:59.180
And F you to Jack Thompson because MPQ said so.

02:39:59.180 --> 02:40:02.420
And F you to someone for making Sakurina is pissed.

02:40:02.420 --> 02:40:06.580
Oops, I advertised that channel, sorry.

02:40:06.580 --> 02:40:08.940
Yay, somebody in the chat room said, I heart this song.

02:40:08.940 --> 02:40:10.740
I heart it too, thank you.

02:40:10.740 --> 02:40:36.740
Alright, lesson to Zaku says, F you to this being my last week at home before having to move back to campus next Sunday, F you to being broke and being jobless for almost nine months, F you to not having enough time to hang out with other fellow DDR players every time I go to Chinatown Fair, a DDR in the Groove 2 arcade in Chinatown in New York City, and F you to having to wear a retainer after my braces were removed last week. They hurt like hell and I can't speak in them clearly. In them.

02:40:40.740 --> 02:40:48.420
Kuwabara says, F you to Noria for making such a sexy video to Sylvia Drive, I can't pass

02:40:48.420 --> 02:40:51.580
the fucking song.

02:40:51.580 --> 02:40:56.380
Goggle says, not Google, but Goggle says, I would like to say F you to US News college

02:40:56.380 --> 02:40:57.380
rankings.

02:40:57.380 --> 02:41:00.900
They really don't mean anything, but all the overachieving, pushy parents flock to the

02:41:00.900 --> 02:41:05.300
top ones and crowd up the tours so I can't hear anything.

02:41:05.300 --> 02:41:08.380
Tomokun would like to say, fuck starting school soon.

02:41:08.380 --> 02:41:11.880
People I don't know taking pictures of me playing Para Para dancing

02:41:11.880 --> 02:41:14.220
and fuck a certain thread in the Midwest forum.

02:41:14.220 --> 02:41:16.900
Fuck fuck!

02:41:16.900 --> 02:41:19.420
Dark Knight wants to give one more FU.

02:41:19.420 --> 02:41:24.300
Oh, and a major FU to some local buttwads that go nuts when they have a laptop sale

02:41:24.300 --> 02:41:25.980
on an old-ass school

02:41:25.980 --> 02:41:30.500
uses iBooks because of this many people got hurt by the idiots.

02:41:30.500 --> 02:41:36.220
I heard about the iBook stampede. It's crazy, there was only an iBook stamp for $50.

02:41:36.220 --> 02:41:41.100
and I giggled. You would. By the way, I haven't heard anyone use the term

02:41:41.100 --> 02:41:44.100
buttwads in like years.

02:41:44.100 --> 02:41:51.180
That's great. Thank you. Ask Orange Lounge when we come back from this quick break

02:41:51.180 --> 02:41:54.740
featuring more Erotic. No, just kidding, cause I'll get beat up if we actually do that.

02:41:54.740 --> 02:41:58.260
I already played Erotic. Erotic fans, I already played it this show.

02:41:58.260 --> 02:42:02.340
How about something with Tar Freaks? I like guitar freaks. Guitar freaks is cool.

02:42:02.340 --> 02:42:06.180
So we're gonna do some of that and when we come back we will

02:42:06.180 --> 02:42:09.000
we'll do some Ask Orange Lounge. We're just going to do a couple songs here. We'll start

02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:12.680
it off with a little bit of Jet Coaster Girl, and we'll be back with more Orange Lounge

02:42:12.680 --> 02:42:19.680
to Ask Orange Lounge. Send in your questions right now.

02:43:42.680 --> 02:44:02.440
Don't you know, don't you know I've been waiting for you

02:44:02.440 --> 02:44:05.560
Don't you know baby you'll just turn up right all the time

02:44:05.560 --> 02:44:09.880
Can't you see, can't you see I've been waiting for you

02:44:09.880 --> 02:44:15.380
See, baby, you just might have lied all the time

02:44:20.880 --> 02:44:23.880
So now with thunder, I wasn't free

02:44:24.380 --> 02:44:27.380
All I wanted was attention

02:44:27.880 --> 02:44:30.880
Party after party, beauty and money

02:44:31.380 --> 02:44:33.880
We were so desperate for perfection

02:44:34.380 --> 02:44:37.380
But you have made me feel so good

02:44:37.380 --> 02:44:41.480
As if I could be closer to you

02:44:41.480 --> 02:44:43.460
I close my eyes

02:44:43.460 --> 02:44:46.980
In your arms like it's never okay

02:44:46.980 --> 02:44:48.260
With...you

02:44:48.260 --> 02:44:50.020
Don't you know, don't you know

02:44:50.020 --> 02:44:51.740
I've been waiting for you

02:44:51.740 --> 02:44:53.160
Don't you know, baby

02:44:53.160 --> 02:44:55.340
You're just gonna crime on time

02:44:55.340 --> 02:44:57.080
Can't you see, can't you see

02:44:57.080 --> 02:44:58.860
I've been waiting for you

02:44:58.860 --> 02:45:00.220
Can't you see, baby

02:45:00.220 --> 02:45:02.340
You're just gonna crime on time

02:45:02.340 --> 02:45:04.040
Don't you know, don't you know

02:45:04.040 --> 02:45:05.860
I've been waiting for you

02:45:05.860 --> 02:45:09.360
Don't you know, baby, you should start off right on time

02:45:09.360 --> 02:45:12.860
Can't you see, can't you see, I've been waiting for you

02:45:12.860 --> 02:45:18.860
Can't you see, baby, you should start off right on time

02:45:18.860 --> 02:45:37.220
Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:45:37.220 --> 02:45:39.500
Alright, you know what time it is, kids.

02:45:39.500 --> 02:45:40.500
Time for the next segment.

02:45:40.500 --> 02:45:48.560
Let's bring it on.

02:45:48.560 --> 02:45:51.920
Let's ask OrangeLounge some stupid question.

02:45:51.920 --> 02:45:55.600
What will we find out this week on OrangeLounge Radio?

02:45:55.600 --> 02:46:01.140
One thing I will tell you, even though nobody asked, is that now Miklotov made this room

02:46:01.140 --> 02:46:03.040
smell like Taco Bell.

02:46:03.040 --> 02:46:09.040
Thanks a lot for that, because Taco Bell makes me sick.

02:46:09.040 --> 02:46:10.040
You're welcome.

02:46:10.040 --> 02:46:12.040
All right.

02:46:12.040 --> 02:46:16.920
Participating in tonight's Ask OrangeLounge, myself, Loki, and Miklotov, everybody else

02:46:16.920 --> 02:46:21.820
left the room for better things I guess. Alright, we're going to start off with Tomo Koon who

02:46:21.820 --> 02:46:27.600
has a question. Do you have any high school freshman tips? Lame question, lolololol. High

02:46:27.600 --> 02:46:31.100
school freshman. God, that was, I don't even want to think about how long ago that was

02:46:31.100 --> 02:46:36.140
for me. It dates me very badly. Wow. Um. High school freshman. You know, just make sure

02:46:36.140 --> 02:46:39.580
you don't fuck up and go to the wrong classes. That's pretty much, I was always worried about

02:46:39.580 --> 02:46:44.460
coming to the wrong classes. Get your schedule, you know, ahead of time. Just, you know, because

02:46:44.460 --> 02:46:49.140
In my situation where I had it was, my junior high split up into two different high schools,

02:46:49.140 --> 02:46:52.740
so some of my friends weren't there and some of them were new, so, you know, find your

02:46:52.740 --> 02:46:59.980
friends, um, just, you know, it's not gonna be that much different than junior high, really.

02:46:59.980 --> 02:47:04.460
And don't, who cares a shit about the upperclassmen, because if they're still picking on you, that's

02:47:04.460 --> 02:47:05.460
retarded.

02:47:05.460 --> 02:47:10.160
Yeah, the upperclassmen hazing thing is so, like, 1970, because every school now has the

02:47:10.160 --> 02:47:14.100
anti-hazing rules, so it's nothing, even when I went to high school, which was quite some

02:47:14.100 --> 02:47:21.100
time ago. They didn't have a problem with that. So, you know what? Just be yourself.

02:47:21.860 --> 02:47:27.020
Don't try to be something you're not. I wish I could tell every high schooler in the world

02:47:27.020 --> 02:47:30.540
that, just be yourself and who cares what other people think. Who cares?

02:47:30.540 --> 02:47:35.940
And really, when you think about it now, when you get out of high school and stuff, you

02:47:35.940 --> 02:47:40.540
look back on it and you're just like, who cares? You know, like, if people didn't like

02:47:40.540 --> 02:47:44.260
you for some reason you don't care all you all you look back on is the things

02:47:44.260 --> 02:47:48.060
that you didn't do that you wish you had that's basically it okay to completely

02:47:48.060 --> 02:47:52.940
countered cutter you know belittle everything they just said establish your

02:47:52.940 --> 02:47:59.500
popularity right away I'm serious it really helps no just I mean yeah be

02:47:59.500 --> 02:48:04.500
yourself and all that but find a cool group to hang with and don't say

02:48:04.500 --> 02:48:08.300
anything stupid and seriously don't give a shit what anybody thinks of you

02:48:08.300 --> 02:48:11.300
because there will be people that will make fun of you.

02:48:11.300 --> 02:48:15.300
Who cares? When it comes to college,

02:48:15.300 --> 02:48:18.800
they're gonna be junkies anyway, so just don't pay them any attention.

02:48:18.800 --> 02:48:22.600
It just makes your high school experience better, yeah. It doesn't matter in the long run, but

02:48:22.600 --> 02:48:26.360
I don't know. The only people you can make fun of are the stupid people.

02:48:26.360 --> 02:48:29.980
Not the retarded people, because they can't help it, but stupid people. Every click

02:48:29.980 --> 02:48:31.240
serves its purpose.

02:48:31.240 --> 02:48:34.760
We gotta move on. We got a ton of questions tonight. I begged twice and I got like

02:48:34.760 --> 02:48:45.760
My question is someone to please describe Quest Mode in UltraMix 3 if they've played it at E3.

02:48:45.760 --> 02:48:49.760
Shane probably can't really say anything about Quest Mode.

02:48:49.760 --> 02:48:51.760
Super deformed characters.

02:48:51.760 --> 02:48:53.760
Yeah, the characters are like the giant heads.

02:48:53.760 --> 02:48:58.760
Basically you move across the capitals of the United States starting in Sacramento.

02:48:58.760 --> 02:48:59.760
Thank you very much.

02:48:59.760 --> 02:49:07.760
I think it costs points to move around the map and you earn points by playing the song in the city.

02:49:07.760 --> 02:49:11.760
Was it like a challenge that you had to do or something?

02:49:11.760 --> 02:49:13.760
Hey, guess what? Quest mode kind of changed since E3.

02:49:13.760 --> 02:49:16.760
Did it? Can you tell us anything new about it?

02:49:16.760 --> 02:49:21.760
No, you can continue though because it follows the same basic principle you're talking about.

02:49:21.760 --> 02:49:26.760
So you earn points by playing the song in the city and then you can move around the map.

02:49:26.760 --> 02:49:28.760
Can you pick up more players as you go?

02:49:28.760 --> 02:49:34.760
I think so, yeah. Pick up more players. I'm assuming that this is going to be how a shitload of things unlock in Ultimix 3, or however many.

02:49:34.760 --> 02:49:42.760
I think the goal is to ultimately conquer all 50 states. Or maybe it's just 48 continental, I don't know.

02:49:42.760 --> 02:49:44.760
That's where you're wrong.

02:49:44.760 --> 02:49:45.760
Oh, really?

02:49:45.760 --> 02:49:46.760
It's around the world.

02:49:46.760 --> 02:49:48.760
That's where you're wrong.

02:49:48.760 --> 02:49:51.760
Canada? Mexico? Oh god, do you have to go to Mexico?

02:49:51.760 --> 02:49:52.760
I hope not.

02:49:52.760 --> 02:49:54.760
I think I'll play DDR in Mexico. It's pumping up there.

02:49:54.760 --> 02:49:56.760
Yeah, it actually is.

02:49:56.760 --> 02:50:05.760
Alright, let's see. So you can't tell us anything about what might have changed? Not anything?

02:50:05.760 --> 02:50:12.760
I really can't. It's just, it's not that big a difference, but there are some subtle changes to it.

02:50:12.760 --> 02:50:16.760
Alright, we'll see. Alright, Rini also wants to know...

02:50:16.760 --> 02:50:17.760
Oh, you will see.

02:50:17.760 --> 02:50:23.760
Rini wants to know, oh, and when are you guys going to do some online UltraMix 2 tournament?

02:50:23.760 --> 02:50:33.760
Um, that's a good idea. Sometime before Ultimix 3, um, in the next couple months when we stop being lazy, we're trying to plan a real DDR tournament, um, and I'm trying to go to the tournament, um, back east as well.

02:50:33.760 --> 02:50:43.760
Um, it shouldn't be that hard. We'll maybe start a forum, or a thread in the forums and see if there's enough interest in it, because last time we tried to do it, like, nobody wanted to play.

02:50:43.760 --> 02:50:46.760
So, we will see.

02:50:46.760 --> 02:50:50.760
Um, we'll post a thread in the forums and see what we get out of that.

02:50:50.760 --> 02:50:54.760
Sakurino wants to know, what is the official release date for Extreme 2?

02:50:54.760 --> 02:50:58.440
I'll field that one.

02:50:58.440 --> 02:51:02.280
It's September, I want to say

02:51:02.280 --> 02:51:06.280
27th. That might be the 26th.

02:51:06.280 --> 02:51:09.280
I know it's the last week of September.

02:51:09.280 --> 02:51:13.840
Sakurino also wants to know, does Konami of America plan on releasing Dancing Stage

02:51:13.840 --> 02:51:15.920
featuring System of a Down anytime soon?

02:51:15.920 --> 02:51:19.240
I will go ahead and answer that question. No.

02:51:19.240 --> 02:51:22.240
I'll answer it too. No.

02:51:49.240 --> 02:51:56.240
Anyways, it's like they knew I'd like the game later and killed it off just to get me even more pissed when they started attacking in the groove.

02:51:56.240 --> 02:52:02.240
It's the same reason why Billy Ray Cyrus doesn't make any more music. It's because it's not popular anymore.

02:52:02.240 --> 02:52:09.240
Even though there's a lot of sarcasm there, there is some truth. From what I understand, Para Para kinda went downhill in Japan for a little while.

02:52:09.240 --> 02:52:11.240
Yeah, it was a fad. That's all it was.

02:52:11.240 --> 02:52:18.240
But it seems like it's still going on. I mean, you still see Eurobeats big with Initial D and stuff. I have a hard time believing it's dead altogether.

02:52:18.240 --> 02:52:26.200
dead altogether. So, I guess here it is. Why did Keyboard Mania stop? Why did Dance Maniac

02:52:26.200 --> 02:52:30.800
stop? Why did any of those great Bomani series that we don't come to love until long after

02:52:30.800 --> 02:52:35.840
they stopped stop because they didn't make enough money? They didn't sell enough machines?

02:52:35.840 --> 02:52:40.800
The end. That's the reason. Infer what you want about the culture and the pop thing.

02:52:40.800 --> 02:52:45.680
If it didn't make money, that's why it didn't continue. But then again, DDR was making

02:52:45.680 --> 02:52:54.680
No money, but whatever. Whatever. We could argue about that until we're blue in the face.

02:52:54.680 --> 02:52:59.680
Legend of Zaku says, hmm, I wonder what surprises wait for us on the song list for Ultra Mix 3.

02:52:59.680 --> 02:53:01.680
Well, if we told you Zaku, they wouldn't be a surprise.

02:53:01.680 --> 02:53:06.680
Also, is it just me, or is My My My from EX2 a damn good song to freestyle to?

02:53:06.680 --> 02:53:09.680
I'm white, therefore I can't freestyle.

02:53:09.680 --> 02:53:12.680
It's just a good song. It's one of my favorites, that's for sure.

02:53:12.680 --> 02:53:14.680
The background cracks me up, too.

02:53:14.680 --> 02:53:23.680
Initial D? Okay, Jamie's yelling at me in the chatroom because she's saying Initial D is old. Yes, but there's that new movie, right? Isn't that movie that just came out new?

02:53:23.680 --> 02:53:25.680
I think so. Yeah, it's pretty new.

02:53:25.680 --> 02:53:28.680
It's still a thing. It's still its thing.

02:53:28.680 --> 02:53:36.680
It's still doing well over here, too. I mean, because obviously, unless you import the fan subs or whatever, you know.

02:53:36.680 --> 02:53:43.680
Legend of Zaku said this one's for Miklatov. Will Quest Mode make stops at New York City or the East Coast?

02:53:43.680 --> 02:53:47.680
He can't really answer questions about Quest Mode because he's under NDA.

02:53:47.680 --> 02:53:52.680
I will answer it, though. From what I saw at E3, it looks like you were stopping in the capital of every state.

02:53:52.680 --> 02:53:55.680
So you wouldn't stop in New York City, but Albany.

02:53:55.680 --> 02:53:58.680
Ooh, somebody knows their capital.

02:53:58.680 --> 02:54:01.680
Right, I do. I know my Animaniacs song.

02:54:01.680 --> 02:54:10.680
That is the city on the East Coast. All the East Coast cities, I'm assuming from the E3, because Shane can't clarify one way or the other, are represented somehow.

02:54:11.680 --> 02:54:16.680
And that's the challenging part. So the East Coast will be the challenging part, because it's all the way on the other side from where you start.

02:54:19.680 --> 02:54:22.680
DarkSakura says,

02:54:22.680 --> 02:54:27.780
Why the fuck does Southern Style iced tea taste so heavenly?

02:54:27.780 --> 02:54:31.980
I don't know. You know what? I was gonna have iced tea at a Cracker Barrel, which

02:54:31.980 --> 02:54:34.060
is as close to Southern Style as I'll get,

02:54:34.060 --> 02:54:37.100
but I didn't get the chance to do that while I was

02:54:37.100 --> 02:54:41.700
visiting the East Coast. I have a question for her. Why aren't you here supporting

02:54:41.700 --> 02:54:42.900
Pump It Up?

02:54:42.900 --> 02:54:46.660
She can't because of her... she was at Classic Gimmi Expo and she hurt her hip.

02:54:46.660 --> 02:54:49.780
Yeah, but you know what? And she was partially turned into an evil warlord.

02:54:49.780 --> 02:54:56.780
That was really cool. She was already an evil warlord. That is going in the next intro, that's for sure.

02:54:56.780 --> 02:54:59.340
Smack Man would like to know,

02:54:59.340 --> 02:55:02.320
why do only the crappy songs

02:55:02.320 --> 02:55:05.140
get stuck in your head?

02:55:05.140 --> 02:55:07.840
Because you listen to bad music.

02:55:07.840 --> 02:55:12.100
That's a very good question. It's just Murphy's Law that bad songs are going to get stuck in your head.

02:55:12.100 --> 02:55:17.100
And I don't know, you know, it's just a fact of life, so I leave you with this.

02:55:21.100 --> 02:55:23.100
This is a good song!

02:55:27.100 --> 02:55:30.100
Enjoy, courtesy of Orange Lawn's Radio.

02:55:32.100 --> 02:55:34.100
Uhh, Spirit Snare.

02:55:35.100 --> 02:55:39.100
Question, do you get to kill Naoki as an extra stage in quest mode?

02:55:39.100 --> 02:55:41.100
I will answer that question, no you do not.

02:55:41.100 --> 02:55:47.100
I don't work for Konami, and I haven't seen the game outside of E3, but I just know the answer is no, I'm sorry to say.

02:55:47.100 --> 02:55:51.100
But it changed since E3.

02:55:51.100 --> 02:55:55.100
Let's see.

02:55:55.100 --> 02:56:00.100
Addendum. Do you get to kill Jack Thompson as a one more extra stage in quest mode?

02:56:00.100 --> 02:56:03.100
I will also answer that question. No, you do not. Sorry to say.

02:56:03.100 --> 02:56:07.100
And, Konami, could you confirm that? Our Konami rep?

02:56:07.100 --> 02:56:27.100
I hate him as much as you guys do, but he provides entertainment for the morning every day for me because he always says something new and stupid, so I don't want him dead. I don't want him to shut up. So please quit trying to kill him.

02:56:27.100 --> 02:56:32.100
Guys, there's plenty more games for him to be angry over, you know, come fall.

02:56:32.100 --> 02:56:38.100
Yeah, so, I mean, we've just hit the tip of the iceberg. It's gonna get a lot better, I'm sure.

02:56:38.100 --> 02:56:43.100
I don't know, when Titanic hit the tip of the iceberg, it didn't get much better.

02:56:46.100 --> 02:56:49.100
It's almost like the living room had heard that joke.

02:56:51.100 --> 02:56:54.100
God, sometimes I wish we were a TV show, seriously.

02:56:56.100 --> 02:57:00.100
Anyway, we gotta start wrapping up the show. However, there's one more question,

02:57:00.100 --> 02:57:10.100
Why doesn't Konami bring back Hold Notes and Scratches in Beatmania 2DX?

02:57:30.100 --> 02:57:34.100
In Five Key, they did like a hold note where you would have to consistently turn the note.

02:57:34.100 --> 02:57:38.100
Oh, I thought that was a freestyle note. I thought I was just like scratching randomly.

02:57:38.100 --> 02:57:39.100
You know, I would...

02:57:39.100 --> 02:57:41.100
No wonder I didn't do it right, I guess.

02:57:41.100 --> 02:57:44.100
You know what, Rene? This is what I would have to say to that.

02:57:44.100 --> 02:57:47.100
As far as Konami of Japan, I couldn't tell you, but look at this.

02:57:47.100 --> 02:57:51.100
Beatmania Five Key songs are making its way into the U.S.

02:57:51.100 --> 02:57:56.100
And you can already see the Konami U.S. is doing its own thing with Beatmania.

02:57:56.100 --> 02:57:59.820
beat mania like they have the balls to change the interface for one to a new

02:57:59.820 --> 02:58:00.540
color

02:58:00.540 --> 02:58:02.540
granted it's just a new color but it's

02:58:02.540 --> 02:58:03.620
something

02:58:03.620 --> 02:58:06.080
uh... also happy sky difficulty names

02:58:06.080 --> 02:58:10.340
yes and rumor is that uh... the controllers are to be different knows

02:58:10.340 --> 02:58:14.920
it's like a rumor you know it's confirmed it in a there in an interview

02:58:14.920 --> 02:58:15.800
on like

02:58:15.800 --> 02:58:17.640
i think game spot

02:58:17.640 --> 02:58:21.660
they have the rounded edges and they address the button though super thought

02:58:21.660 --> 02:58:22.980
that was

02:58:22.980 --> 02:58:23.820
something that

02:58:23.820 --> 02:58:35.820
And also, I'm hoping that they bring actual hold keys, for example, like in Keyboard Mania or in Easy To DJ. That would be awesome if they implemented that later on.

02:58:35.820 --> 02:58:49.820
So I would say probably not this mix, but they're going to want to have things later on that kind of make their mixes like, ooh, it's the new thing in this mix. Don't count it out for the U.S. mixes. I would say don't count it out for the U.S. later mixes.

02:58:49.820 --> 02:58:55.820
So long as you guys support it and buy it, because I mean, if it tanks, we'll fawn you.

02:58:55.820 --> 02:58:58.820
I'm at least buying a controller to replace my old one.

02:58:58.820 --> 02:59:02.820
Because I'm excited about the idea of the new controller, so we'll see.

02:59:02.820 --> 02:59:05.820
Alright, it's time to wrap up tonight's show. We're going to go around and get everybody...

02:59:05.820 --> 02:59:09.820
Oh, I'm sorry, we have one more question. I totally skipped Tomo-kun's second question.

02:59:09.820 --> 02:59:14.820
Why is it that the Dirty Sex Line commercials show up on broadcast airwaves at night?

02:59:14.820 --> 02:59:16.820
What's wrong with having them during the day?

02:59:16.820 --> 02:59:24.820
Because six-year-old children who don't know any better would call them, who are channel surfing because their parents leave the televisions to babysit them.

02:59:24.820 --> 02:59:26.820
And then blame TV.

02:59:26.820 --> 02:59:27.820
Yep.

02:59:27.820 --> 02:59:34.820
All right, that's going to do it for tonight's episode of Orange Lounge Radio. Thank you guys so much for tuning in and listening to and supporting us, we appreciate it.

02:59:34.820 --> 02:59:39.820
Don't forget, we also have a live show on Tuesday night that's Pump Up the Volume with the one and only Dark Sakura.

02:59:39.820 --> 02:59:44.080
And I will be bringing a show back very soon. I know I've said that for like the past seven weeks

02:59:44.080 --> 02:59:48.300
But I got very sick this week. So that's why I didn't do it. But maybe this next week and

02:59:49.100 --> 02:59:51.500
You know more exciting stuff coming to Orange Lounge radio

02:59:52.580 --> 02:59:55.100
also the podcast you got we have

02:59:55.900 --> 03:00:00.380
An unbelievable amount of listeners on the podcast. Thank you guys so much for your support of podcasts. It's crazy

03:00:00.500 --> 03:00:04.700
We're also working on something for those PSP owners out there. Oh, that's gonna be great

03:00:04.700 --> 03:00:07.700
So we're hoping to have a breakthrough on that being the first

03:00:07.700 --> 03:00:12.500
first online station to have something like that. So we'll see. Anyway, thank you guys

03:00:12.500 --> 03:00:17.420
for your support. We appreciate you. Love you. Final thought time. Miklotov, thanks

03:00:17.420 --> 03:00:22.700
for coming in tonight and telling us nothing about DDR, but giving us some good hints about

03:00:22.700 --> 03:00:28.500
Pump It Up. That's good. Hey, it wasn't a hint, it was facts. I know. Any final thoughts?

03:00:28.500 --> 03:00:35.600
I have two. One, I ate too much Taco Bell, now my stomach hurts. And two, does anybody

03:00:35.600 --> 03:00:39.600
How do you want to go to work for me tomorrow? Because I don't.

03:00:39.600 --> 03:00:41.600
Loki, your final thought.

03:00:41.600 --> 03:00:46.600
I've got to bring over next week the iToy, because I have...

03:00:46.600 --> 03:00:52.600
Well, and the microphone, because I have SingStar Pop, that one we've got to try out.

03:00:52.600 --> 03:00:53.600
Yeah, I want to see that.

03:00:53.600 --> 03:01:01.600
And then I also have iToy Harry Potter, iToy Sega, and iToy Play, and I think I'm going to try to get Play 2 as well.

03:01:01.600 --> 03:01:12.600
Even though Dark Sakura, I think, called it a bastardization of the original Samba de Amigo, I really want to play the Itoi Samba, because I didn't get to play it at E3.

03:01:12.600 --> 03:01:17.600
So, I don't want to misquote her. She might not have said that, but I'm pretty sure she didn't say the best thing about it.

03:01:17.600 --> 03:01:20.600
So, she'll be here to talk about that next week. She'll be back next week.

03:01:20.600 --> 03:01:30.100
But, um, there's that, and then, um, I've got an actual, um, another import I gotta try. It's another street racing game, so we're, like, initial D.

03:01:30.100 --> 03:01:41.600
They need to put, um, what was it, um, Midnight Tune on their Wang Dang's Maxi- Midnight Maximum Tune on the console systems, cause that'd be awesome. That game's actually pretty cool.

03:01:41.600 --> 03:01:56.600
Alrighty, and I would just like to say thank you guys very much for listening, and I hope I feel better next week, and I'm just looking forward to getting in some major gaming this next week with my brand new PlayStation.

03:01:56.600 --> 03:02:03.600
And on behalf of DarkSakura, I'd like to say reject false icons, because you know that's her thing, that's what she'd say if she were here.

03:02:03.600 --> 03:02:09.600
And, um, that's it, the final word of the show, one word to sum it all up, the one and only Miek Letov.

03:02:11.600 --> 03:02:13.600
What?

03:02:14.600 --> 03:02:19.600
That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.

03:02:19.600 --> 03:02:24.600

And now, here is your fortune cookie message of the day.

03:02:42.600 --> 03:02:47.600
Hello, boys and girls. This is your old pal, Stinky Wizzleteeth.

03:02:48.600 --> 03:02:51.600
This is a song about a player. No!

03:02:52.600 --> 03:02:56.600
This is a song about being happy. That's right!

03:02:56.600 --> 03:03:00.060
It's a happy, happy, joy, joy song.

03:03:00.060 --> 03:03:06.020
Happy, happy, joy, joy, happy, happy, joy, joy.

03:03:06.020 --> 03:03:09.640
Happy, happy, joy, joy, happy, happy, joy, joy.

03:03:09.640 --> 03:03:13.380
Happy, happy, joy, joy, happy, happy, joy, joy.

03:03:13.380 --> 03:03:15.060
Happy, happy, joy, joy, joy.

03:03:15.060 --> 03:03:16.640
Happy, happy, joy, joy, joy.

03:03:16.640 --> 03:03:18.560
I don't think you're happy enough.

03:03:18.560 --> 03:03:19.720
That's right.

03:03:19.720 --> 03:03:22.260
I'll teach you to be happy.

03:03:22.260 --> 03:03:26.040
I'll teach your grandmother to suck eggs.

03:03:26.040 --> 03:03:28.040
Let's try it again.

03:03:29.040 --> 03:03:42.040
Happy, happy Joy Joy! Happy, happy Joy joy! Happy, happy Joy joy!

03:03:43.040 --> 03:03:45.040
If you knew ain't the grand daddy of all liars.

03:03:46.040 --> 03:03:48.040
The little critters of nature.

03:03:48.040 --> 03:03:50.040
They don't know that they're ugly.

03:03:51.040 --> 03:03:52.040
That's very funny.

03:03:52.040 --> 03:03:55.860
That's very funny. A fly marrying a bumblebee?

03:03:56.600 --> 03:03:59.540
I told you I'd shoot, but you didn't believe me.

03:03:59.840 --> 03:04:01.740

And fade to black, that's the end of the show.

03:05:00.080 --> 03:05:06.200
Now we're going to go to our Bomani music and video game music program right after switching

03:05:06.200 --> 03:05:07.200
the stream over.

03:05:07.200 --> 03:05:10.240
So that means you guys are going to get booted from the stream, but please reconnect in about

03:05:10.240 --> 03:05:16.880
30 seconds to resume hearing all your favorite DDR, 2DX, and video game favorite music.

03:05:16.880 --> 03:05:19.400
And yeah, please reconnect, and don't forget our podcast.

03:05:19.400 --> 03:05:22.120
We're going to go tape that right now, and that will be up Monday morning.

03:05:22.120 --> 03:05:23.120
So see you guys later.

03:05:23.120 --> 03:05:24.060
