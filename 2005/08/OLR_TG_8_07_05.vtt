[SPEAKER_00]: Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of August 8th.

00:07.633 --> 00:15.578
[SPEAKER_01]: You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.

00:15.838 --> 00:19.520
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.

00:20.981 --> 00:23.883
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to another edition of Orange Lounge Radio To Go.

00:24.503 --> 00:28.826
[SPEAKER_03]: I am Loki, and with us tonight we have the lovely DarkSakura.

00:29.983 --> 00:32.204
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, hello.

00:55.663 --> 01:00.226
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to start everything off how Sky normally does it with how was your gaming week?

01:00.626 --> 01:02.468
[SPEAKER_03]: So Jamie, what did you play this week?

01:03.949 --> 01:07.251
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than widescreen Pong, which actually I didn't play this week.

01:07.351 --> 01:11.514
[SPEAKER_00]: I played some PSO, looked at some games.

01:11.554 --> 01:15.576
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually have Rob's birthday present here that I finally got my hands on.

01:16.137 --> 01:18.478
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that he was wanting, but I'll let him talk about that next week.

01:19.619 --> 01:25.443
[SPEAKER_00]: Mainly, I've been trying to get stuff together because I start school next week, plus I have an announcement.

01:27.305 --> 01:27.905
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the announcement?

01:28.606 --> 01:31.927
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting married on September 1st, so I've been sort of busy doing wedding stuff.

01:32.327 --> 01:34.228
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, they don't have wedding planner at the game.

01:34.728 --> 01:35.028
[SPEAKER_00]: Not yet.

01:37.209 --> 01:37.969
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, that's pretty soon.

01:39.590 --> 01:40.010
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

01:40.510 --> 01:43.151
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this week I played quite a bit, actually.

01:43.691 --> 01:47.753
[SPEAKER_03]: I started off the week with beating Star Soldier on the PSP, which is fun.

01:48.353 --> 01:49.594
[SPEAKER_03]: So now I'm done with that.

01:50.534 --> 01:55.556
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I actually played We Love Katamari, the Japanese version, so that was really nice.

01:56.278 --> 01:57.299
[SPEAKER_03]: I've played that.

01:57.339 --> 01:58.839
[SPEAKER_03]: I've played that and it's kind of crap.

01:58.859 --> 01:59.240
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

01:59.260 --> 02:00.360
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was kind of fun, but...

02:21.309 --> 02:22.150
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just weird like that.

02:23.750 --> 02:29.113
[SPEAKER_03]: Then also, I was able to play, let's see, Burnout 3.

02:29.233 --> 02:31.694
[SPEAKER_03]: That game is so much fucking fun.

02:31.714 --> 02:38.217
[SPEAKER_03]: It's definitely worth the best racing game of the year.

02:38.297 --> 02:39.177
[SPEAKER_03]: That G4 2005, they said, you know.

02:41.560 --> 02:43.901
[SPEAKER_03]: Great games, just like an arcade racing game.

02:43.981 --> 02:45.281
[SPEAKER_03]: You can smash through everything.

02:45.542 --> 02:47.182
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really, really, really fun.

02:47.202 --> 02:48.363
[SPEAKER_03]: I cannot stress how fun it is.

02:49.203 --> 02:50.963
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to play some In the Groove this week.

02:52.504 --> 02:53.925
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, we know how that is.

02:54.165 --> 02:59.206
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's basically about as bad as I thought it was.

02:59.547 --> 03:03.828
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm glad you know that I was renting it and not buying it.

03:04.588 --> 03:08.270
[SPEAKER_03]: And I actually got to try out a little bit of Genji.

03:09.690 --> 03:19.663
[SPEAKER_03]: which is pretty cool, Japanese I can't understand it, and Namco X Capcom, which has one of the most kickass anime intros I've ever seen for a game, so really cool.

03:20.885 --> 03:21.325
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways...

03:23.334 --> 03:28.256
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I was going to try that one game that was suggested to me by one of our listeners.

03:29.616 --> 03:34.257
[SPEAKER_00]: However, again, with this week being as hectic as it was, I haven't got a chance, although I've started the download on it.

03:34.317 --> 03:44.761
[SPEAKER_00]: But another one of our listeners has pointed me in the direction of another game that I'm going to be giving a try sometime this week as well that's along the same lines.

03:44.781 --> 03:45.841
[SPEAKER_00]: It's supposed to be pretty cool.

03:47.944 --> 03:49.905
[SPEAKER_03]: All good things come from Florida.

04:10.569 --> 04:15.110
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, we've got Jack Thompson coming after Killer7 now.

04:15.970 --> 04:32.075
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically, his quote is, There is no question in my mind that a video game containing full-blown sex sequences cannot be rated anything other than adults only, rather than M. The full-blown sex sequences are no more than you could see in an R-rated movie.

04:34.065 --> 04:45.908
[SPEAKER_03]: But for those who aren't keeping tally, Jack Thompson was the guy that actually brought this whole hot coffee thing to the table and blew it way out of proportion, like everything, and just is coming after yet more games.

04:46.848 --> 04:49.248
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, he's the lead asshole in charge of the brigade.

04:50.269 --> 04:51.629
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, he sucks.

04:52.249 --> 05:00.591
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically, he actually did an interview on Chatterbox Video Game Radio, basically bitching about different things, and including...

05:01.321 --> 05:07.665
[SPEAKER_03]: How he says Will Wright wants Electronic Arts to collaborate with the porn industry to allow wholesale modification of their game, Sims 2.

05:08.825 --> 05:10.747
[SPEAKER_03]: Because of this whole third-party porn thing.

05:10.807 --> 05:14.929
[SPEAKER_03]: Which, by the way, has nothing to do with EA's game in the first place.

05:15.169 --> 05:18.251
[SPEAKER_03]: This is completely like some perverted people out there making mods.

05:18.271 --> 05:25.535
[SPEAKER_03]: Because Sims 2 allows you to actually make third-party mods, including brand new clothing, skins, and furniture and whatnot.

05:26.515 --> 05:29.037
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, you know there's going to be somebody out there that's going to make a nude skin.

05:30.157 --> 05:35.901
[SPEAKER_03]: So, he's blaming them, saying, oh, well, you know, because you're allowing modification in the game, you're to blame for this crap.

05:36.762 --> 05:37.382
[SPEAKER_03]: It's retarded.

05:37.902 --> 05:40.144
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, extremely retarded, this guy is.

05:40.884 --> 05:44.267
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish we could get him on our show so I could punch him in the face, but, you know, that's just me.

05:45.047 --> 05:47.369
[SPEAKER_03]: But, the other thing.

05:47.708 --> 05:47.928
[SPEAKER_03]: and so on.

06:06.149 --> 06:10.231
[SPEAKER_03]: We actually have anti-bullying groups coming out to Rockstar about this game saying they shouldn't be released.

06:10.511 --> 06:12.212
[SPEAKER_03]: And they have a list of demands.

06:12.672 --> 06:17.754
[SPEAKER_03]: A list of demands that they basically wanted them to donate money to this anti-bullying fund.

06:18.074 --> 06:21.755
[SPEAKER_03]: They're saying that games like Grand Theft Auto and stuff actually raise insurance rates.

06:22.056 --> 06:26.097
[SPEAKER_03]: Just throwing out all these bogus, weird claims that mean nothing.

06:26.197 --> 06:27.638
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just groundless.

06:28.772 --> 06:44.000
[SPEAKER_00]: They obviously haven't read, like I brought up last week, about the FBI's reports and stuff put out by our government stating that crime has gone down since the release of the first PlayStation.

06:45.001 --> 06:51.804
[SPEAKER_00]: Wouldn't that go to show that they're actually being given an outlet for this aggression instead of going out and actually committing the crime?

06:52.045 --> 06:53.805
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, does that make sense, maybe?

06:54.226 --> 06:56.487
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they've got their heads too far up their asses, unfortunately.

06:59.025 --> 07:10.830
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, we've had activists, they're demonstrating outside of New York's, or Rockstar's New York offices, and they had a list of demands, which I like to read some of their lists, which is great.

07:12.423 --> 07:17.426
[SPEAKER_03]: They demand that Rockstar not to release Bully under any circumstances.

07:17.526 --> 07:22.289
[SPEAKER_03]: Volunteer to sell its violent and sexually explicit games in adult video stores only.

07:22.669 --> 07:31.534
[SPEAKER_03]: Let parents return Grand Theft Auto for a full refund until they do a national awareness campaign to educate parents of the possible effects.

07:32.055 --> 07:37.038
[SPEAKER_03]: Create a fund for victims of unauthorized use of motor vehicle and carjackings, etc.,

07:37.765 --> 07:46.188
[SPEAKER_03]: Make a national apology for misleading and lying to children and parents and legislators about their intentions and causing insurance premiums to skyrocket.

07:47.985 --> 07:56.331
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, and it says they have to give a written response within five business days of the receipt of these demands.

07:57.331 --> 08:05.097
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, they're not going to get any of that crap, because there is no, again, like I said before, there is no legal precedent.

08:05.177 --> 08:07.558
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, they're so full of shit right at this.

08:08.179 --> 08:09.600
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, think about this.

08:10.700 --> 08:17.225
[SPEAKER_00]: How is a video game responsible for insurance rates increasing, though it has nothing to do with that?

08:18.145 --> 08:24.429
[SPEAKER_00]: The game itself, has there been anything published that says it has a sexually explicit content for Bully?

08:24.649 --> 08:25.910
[SPEAKER_00]: Something about being in school?

08:27.470 --> 08:30.292
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they're just saying that they're totally speculating.

08:30.312 --> 08:31.693
[SPEAKER_03]: This game isn't even done yet.

08:31.913 --> 08:35.515
[SPEAKER_03]: They haven't even seen anything except for one screenshot that's out there.

08:35.675 --> 08:40.458
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I've seen one screenshot, maybe four different screenshots, but it's all pretty much the same thing.

08:41.358 --> 08:44.160
[SPEAKER_03]: No one knows what this thing is about other than the main character is a bully.

08:45.697 --> 08:46.057
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

08:46.217 --> 08:49.058
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't even know what the game's about and they're already bitching about it.

08:49.439 --> 08:49.979
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

08:50.459 --> 08:51.259
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the other thing.

08:51.340 --> 08:53.621
[SPEAKER_03]: The games are rated M for mature.

08:53.641 --> 08:55.761
[SPEAKER_03]: 17 and over, people.

08:55.922 --> 09:01.144
[SPEAKER_03]: You're telling me that an average 17-year-old in this day and age does not know what sex is.

09:02.541 --> 09:02.961
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

09:03.321 --> 09:03.861
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm sure.

09:04.322 --> 09:06.802
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, what do you think a 17-year-old has done more?

09:07.182 --> 09:08.903
[SPEAKER_03]: Had sex or murdered people?

09:10.023 --> 09:14.764
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably said, you know, played with, you know, thumb and five fingers, but that's another story.

09:15.205 --> 09:16.825
[SPEAKER_00]: They at least know what it's for, right?

09:18.405 --> 09:19.326
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me put it this way, okay?

09:19.466 --> 09:21.946
[SPEAKER_03]: The average teenager out there knows what sex is.

09:22.307 --> 09:23.447
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's taught in schools.

09:23.687 --> 09:27.308
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell, we have, you know, sexual content in PG-13 movies nowadays.

09:27.368 --> 09:27.548
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean...

09:28.083 --> 09:28.684
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

09:49.497 --> 09:50.157
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura.com

10:18.948 --> 10:22.330
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell do you expect these games to have content-wise anyways?

10:22.651 --> 10:26.493
[SPEAKER_03]: Killer7, hmm, that must be about ponies and fairies, right?

10:26.914 --> 10:30.596
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Grand Theft Auto, hmm, what does Grand Theft Auto mean?

10:30.616 --> 10:32.338
[SPEAKER_03]: It means stealing fucking cars!

10:32.658 --> 10:34.619
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think that's gonna be about, you know?

10:35.100 --> 10:42.085
[SPEAKER_03]: Horses and ponies and magical, you know, pixies and, you know, the world of fun and, you know, good behavior?

10:42.305 --> 10:45.107
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's about violence and about...

10:45.567 --> 10:46.208
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

11:14.594 --> 11:15.074
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

11:16.315 --> 11:18.316
[SPEAKER_03]: We've actually got some interesting stuff.

11:19.256 --> 11:23.559
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing is Sony is already saying that the Xbox 360 may suck.

11:23.899 --> 11:29.402
[SPEAKER_03]: And just because of that, they may release their PlayStation 3 in 2007.

11:29.962 --> 11:37.286
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason behind it is they're worried that the 360 might have a weak launch library and basically it's going to fail.

11:38.158 --> 11:40.041
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, yeah, that's gonna fail, alright.

11:40.061 --> 11:43.926
[SPEAKER_03]: Then that first next-gen system coming out, and they're hyping the hell out of this, and it's gonna fail.

11:44.046 --> 11:48.873
[SPEAKER_03]: No, honestly, people are gonna buy this game, or this system, whether it has crappy games or not.

11:48.933 --> 11:49.734
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, look at the DS.

11:50.996 --> 11:53.440
[SPEAKER_03]: Though, remember what happened with the Dreamcast, sadly.

11:54.966 --> 12:00.547
[SPEAKER_03]: True, but I mean the Xbox 360, I mean you've got MTV backing it, I don't think so.

12:01.067 --> 12:06.788
[SPEAKER_03]: But the PlayStation 3 launching in 2007, I think that's a big mistake in the first place.

12:07.008 --> 12:19.610
[SPEAKER_03]: They're basically going to kill themselves if they end up doing that because you're going to have the revolution come out and even let's say that the Xbox 360 does flop, well then you've got the revolution, people are going to be buying that and well, where's Sony?

12:20.190 --> 12:23.891
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they're just not there because they're waiting for their big launch library.

12:24.938 --> 12:25.978
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not going to happen.

12:26.319 --> 12:33.041
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're hoping to ride the success of the PlayStation 2 because it's going to drop down to $99, which is good.

12:33.281 --> 12:37.383
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they'll outsell the Xbox, but it's not going to outsell the Xbox 360.

12:38.604 --> 12:38.924
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

12:39.244 --> 12:43.486
[SPEAKER_03]: But either way, I'm going to be buying both systems when they come out, whenever that is.

12:46.260 --> 12:48.761
[SPEAKER_00]: I've actually got some news in relation to the 360.

12:51.563 --> 13:01.728
[SPEAKER_00]: There actually is a preliminary release list from the Japan Xbox Summit 2005.

13:03.368 --> 13:07.210
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the ones brought up, they had like a mixtape trailer of different things.

13:09.231 --> 13:12.593
[SPEAKER_00]: We have Tony Hawk's American Wasteland.

13:12.753 --> 13:13.893
[SPEAKER_00]: We have Quake 4.

13:14.674 --> 13:20.096
[SPEAKER_00]: We have A-Train X. And for anyone who isn't into those train sims, again, this is the Japan one.

13:20.437 --> 13:22.398
[SPEAKER_00]: And the A-Train series did do very well.

13:23.038 --> 13:25.739
[SPEAKER_00]: Test Drive Unlimited, a Gundam game.

13:25.759 --> 13:27.140
[SPEAKER_00]: Bondi's putting out a Gundam game.

13:27.880 --> 13:31.922
[SPEAKER_00]: And also two titles that are, I'm supposing, anime themed.

13:33.043 --> 13:34.684
[SPEAKER_00]: Bon Presto putting out Super Robot Wars.

13:35.584 --> 14:01.458
[SPEAKER_00]: and of course Super Robot Wars has been going on since like the Super Famicom so it's been out for a while King of Fighters Maximum Impact 2 Resident Evil 5 Dead Rising from Capcom we have Eidos is putting out a title D3 Publishers Electronic Arts putting out some soccer and NBA games Need for Speed Most Wanted The Godfather

14:02.866 --> 14:15.155
[SPEAKER_00]: Enchant Arm, Frontier Groove, Tokyo Extreme Racer, Far East of Eden, Hudson Soft Rumble Roses XX winning 11, Ridge Racer 6, Frame City Killer There's too much coming out that I don't think it's going to flop.

14:28.652 --> 14:35.996
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, what their strategy this time is actually listen to what the Japanese players want instead of just releasing a system there that's basically an American system.

14:36.517 --> 14:37.978
[SPEAKER_03]: Another title that was coming out was Genji.

14:38.158 --> 14:40.319
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, actually, that's PlayStation 3, not 360.

14:40.659 --> 14:44.662
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, but yeah, they're definitely releasing some good library titles.

14:45.302 --> 14:46.383
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't wait for Ridge Racer 6.

14:47.363 --> 14:49.385
[SPEAKER_03]: Ridge Racer 6 is going to be fucking awesome.

14:50.545 --> 14:53.287
[SPEAKER_03]: And Ghost Recon, the new ones are going to be great.

14:54.625 --> 15:01.530
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still wanting to know what Treasure is putting out, because Treasure was the group that gave us Silhouette Mirage and Gunstar Heroes.

15:01.951 --> 15:02.811
[SPEAKER_00]: They're pretty awesome.

15:04.733 --> 15:09.416
[SPEAKER_03]: I also saw that Gun was mentioned on there, which is probably going to be one of the best Western games ever.

15:10.397 --> 15:15.961
[SPEAKER_03]: Just from what I've seen so far, it's coming out on the two current consoles right now, PlayStation 2 and Xbox.

15:16.702 --> 15:18.824
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to be amazing from what I've seen.

15:20.117 --> 15:24.618
[SPEAKER_03]: Dead or Alive, I mean, three Dead or Alive games is a little overkill for me, I think.

15:25.279 --> 15:33.281
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless, unless, there's new Dead or Alive Beach Volleyball, in which case, oh, there is a brand new Dead or Alive Beach Volleyball.

15:33.761 --> 15:41.564
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, yes, more titillating action fan service to the extreme on Xbox 360.

15:41.804 --> 15:42.264
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't wait.

15:42.444 --> 15:46.165
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't wait for the Dead or Alive movie because this is, I hope it's all TNA.

15:46.685 --> 15:47.246
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I hope.

15:48.146 --> 15:48.566
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way,

15:49.630 --> 15:57.117
[SPEAKER_03]: I did see some trailers, they had a new teaser for Aeon Flux, and I might have to say that that movie's gonna kick ass.

15:57.757 --> 16:01.080
[SPEAKER_03]: And the game's also gonna kick ass, because it looks pretty sweet so far from what I've seen.

16:02.701 --> 16:03.582
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, awesome!

16:04.583 --> 16:05.704
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you have any other stories for us?

16:08.171 --> 16:12.733
[SPEAKER_00]: I have another one, of course, Midway's doing Feel the Rush.

16:13.434 --> 16:16.275
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got some celebrity talent and music lined up for it.

16:16.815 --> 16:23.799
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing that has me the most excited about this is it's really got an RPG element to this.

16:25.460 --> 16:28.381
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the main rivals in the game is voiced by Bill Bellamy.

16:30.122 --> 16:37.507
[SPEAKER_00]: We have also just quite a number of people lending their talent from West Coast Customs.

16:37.727 --> 16:40.348
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also the list of cars.

16:40.748 --> 16:43.390
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a bunch of new Dodges like the new Charger.

16:43.890 --> 16:47.752
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the H2, which is a piece of crap, you know, fake Hummer.

16:48.613 --> 16:50.854
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a 1966 Pontiac GTO.

16:51.154 --> 16:51.695
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that cool?

16:53.135 --> 17:21.950
[SPEAKER_00]: the new Lotus Exige we have Mitsubishi Spider we have the Lancer Evo 5 Skyline GTR which is actually one of my favorite cars but also you're going to be able to upgrade your cars with official parts you know we have Nismo which was I'm actually sort of surprised to not see any of the rally art stuff in there since they've got Mitsubishi in there but it looks like it's going to be a fairly interactive racing game I think it's going to be pretty cool

17:24.048 --> 17:24.268
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

17:26.509 --> 17:34.590
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, obviously, there's a lot of stuff coming out in the future with the brand new systems coming out, but let's talk about some of the stuff that's going to be coming out in the next few weeks here.

17:34.690 --> 17:41.552
[SPEAKER_03]: First off, we have next week releasing one of the godfathers of all sports games, Madden 2006, which is going to be awesome.

17:41.912 --> 17:46.373
[SPEAKER_03]: They have the brand new Superstar Mode, which actually links up with the NCAA 2006 as well.

17:47.113 --> 17:51.234
[SPEAKER_03]: If you like those sports games, personally, I couldn't care for them, but, you know, they're really good.

17:51.912 --> 17:52.573
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

18:09.488 --> 18:10.029
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of fun.

18:10.549 --> 18:16.014
[SPEAKER_03]: And also we have coming out Darkwatch which is going to be the following week.

18:17.395 --> 18:27.504
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically a very interesting vampire western type game which plays very similar to Halo 2 and is freaking incredible is what it is.

18:29.646 --> 18:36.532
[SPEAKER_03]: Personally I'm waiting for the stuff in September like We Love Katamari and the new Ultimate Spider-Man and that type of stuff.

18:37.679 --> 18:40.741
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, I take my wedding presents in video games.

18:41.361 --> 18:43.062
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, not necessarily housewares.

18:46.583 --> 18:47.004
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, boy.

18:48.724 --> 18:54.147
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing also we should be looking forward to, the new Grand Theft Auto, which is going to be coming out, obviously, in October.

18:55.088 --> 18:56.448
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, lots of fun stuff.

18:58.689 --> 19:01.591
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, DarkSakura, do you have any advice for us this week?

19:03.837 --> 19:09.859
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I ever... Today's bit of advice is how to escape from a bear.

19:10.359 --> 19:12.659
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we all need to know how to escape from a bear.

19:14.040 --> 19:15.880
[SPEAKER_03]: How to escape from a giant hairy gay guy?

19:18.141 --> 19:19.981
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, we shipped... I'm sorry.

19:20.562 --> 19:21.262
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to go there.

19:21.842 --> 19:22.142
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

19:22.802 --> 19:24.943
[SPEAKER_00]: Today's bit of advice is how to escape from a bear.

19:26.352 --> 19:30.776
[SPEAKER_00]: 1.

19:26.792 --> 19:30.776
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see a bear but it does not see you, make your presence known and back away.

19:31.317 --> 19:33.239
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk loudly, clap, sing, or call out.

19:33.660 --> 19:36.102
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no guaranteed minimum safe distance from a bear.

19:36.403 --> 19:37.223
[SPEAKER_00]: The farther the better.

19:37.704 --> 19:39.366
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are in a car, remain in your vehicle.

19:39.606 --> 19:41.608
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not get out, even for a quick photo.

19:42.009 --> 19:42.970
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep your windows up.

19:43.070 --> 19:45.332
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not impede the bear from crossing the road.

19:47.374 --> 19:50.995
[SPEAKER_00]: 2.

19:48.094 --> 19:50.995
[SPEAKER_00]: If the bear looks as if it is about to attack, do not run.

19:51.075 --> 19:51.715
[SPEAKER_00]: Remain still.

19:52.156 --> 19:55.757
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, bears can run much faster than humans, and bears can climb trees.

19:56.237 --> 20:01.859
[SPEAKER_00]: However, documented attacks show that an attack by another black bear often ends up when the person stops fighting.

20:02.379 --> 20:04.099
[SPEAKER_00]: Also ends, I'm sorry, when the person stops fighting.

20:04.880 --> 20:04.099
3.

20:05.440 --> 20:09.061
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are lying still and the bear attacks, strike back with anything you can.

20:09.381 --> 20:11.281
[SPEAKER_00]: Go for the bear's eyes or its snout.

20:11.682 --> 20:15.803
[SPEAKER_00]: But my final bit of advice, don't feed the bears.

20:17.970 --> 20:20.371
[SPEAKER_03]: and also don't cover yourself in honey.

20:21.972 --> 20:22.793
[SPEAKER_00]: The Bears.

20:22.813 --> 20:26.635
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you remember that on Saturday Night Live where they used to have Ditka?

20:26.815 --> 20:27.295
[SPEAKER_00]: That was cool.

20:28.796 --> 20:29.616
[SPEAKER_03]: The Bears.

20:30.076 --> 20:30.617
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

20:31.597 --> 20:35.219
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, a little bit of the hack and cracking news we've got.

20:36.240 --> 20:38.221
[SPEAKER_03]: Starting off with the PlayStation Portable.

20:38.321 --> 20:39.401
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, that's right, folks.

20:39.421 --> 20:40.562
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll be able to use it with the Xbox 360.

20:40.602 --> 20:41.022
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, that...

20:42.822 --> 20:45.064
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't a bad idea, I don't know what is.

20:45.704 --> 20:56.532
[SPEAKER_03]: But basically, you'll be able to actually use their media browser on the 360 to do everything from view your photos to listen to MP3s that are on the PSP.

20:56.973 --> 21:01.716
[SPEAKER_03]: But pretty much it can sync up with any music player or whatnot, iPod, etc.

21:02.697 --> 21:04.599
[SPEAKER_03]: And the PSP being, you know, just like those.

21:06.080 --> 21:07.120
[SPEAKER_03]: We have the brand new...

21:08.663 --> 21:09.524
[SPEAKER_03]: Jack and Daxter Fired Up

21:28.486 --> 21:35.989
[SPEAKER_03]: And other news, because we can't just cover all the PSP crack and stuff, we've also got to cover the PlayStation 2.

21:36.650 --> 21:46.754
[SPEAKER_03]: And for the PlayStation 2, they actually released Media Player Pro, which is a, of course, media player for the PlayStation 2, which supports CD audio.

21:47.835 --> 21:49.696
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, you can use it to view your...

21:51.417 --> 21:52.778
[SPEAKER_03]: The Key Launcher Key Launcher

22:22.110 --> 22:22.850
[SPEAKER_03]: Doom was ported to the iPod.

22:46.684 --> 22:51.746
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, those people, they'll port anything on Linux, and Doom is probably the next best thing.

22:52.627 --> 22:54.347
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still waiting for Linux for Toaster.

22:54.507 --> 22:56.388
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, my bagels need to burn programs too.

22:57.789 --> 22:58.289
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

22:58.729 --> 23:04.292
[SPEAKER_03]: We need Linux for the DS, because honestly, there's nothing for the DS right now.

23:05.172 --> 23:06.433
[SPEAKER_03]: I need mine in 10 dogs.

23:06.473 --> 23:07.373
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I need too.

23:09.254 --> 23:11.855
[SPEAKER_00]: I get to play with my puppies, but for five minutes at a time.

23:12.896 --> 23:13.416
[SPEAKER_00]: Ha ha ha.

23:15.242 --> 23:19.284
[SPEAKER_03]: Other things, more stuff for the browser, the 2.0 browser.

23:19.964 --> 23:31.811
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people have actually done a pretty cool WinPSPortal 2.0, which resembles a desktop, a Windows XP desktop, and actually is pretty cool from what I've tried out so far.

23:32.431 --> 23:35.213
[SPEAKER_03]: I personally don't have my PSP updated to 2.0 because...

23:36.413 --> 23:37.434
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, just not going to do that.

23:37.614 --> 23:57.241
[SPEAKER_03]: But the other thing was they also found out one of the little, um, things about the PSP 2.0 is that it will launch, um, custom programs if you put it in the update folder, but then immediately discovers that the program is not what it's signed to be and then stops loading it, but that might be, that might lead to, um, them breaking through the version 2.0 firmware.

23:58.381 --> 23:59.962
[SPEAKER_03]: Only a matter of time before they do that.

24:02.639 --> 24:05.680
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we can hold our breath, but we might turn blue before it happens.

24:05.780 --> 24:10.121
[SPEAKER_00]: Then again, maybe we'll just turn like a slight shade of purple and then take our breath again.

24:11.861 --> 24:14.342
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I wanted to dip into the mailbox if you were done.

24:15.182 --> 24:15.442
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

24:16.582 --> 24:20.503
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually have gotten quite a number of emails, but I'm going to go ahead and read just one or two.

24:20.963 --> 24:25.805
[SPEAKER_00]: We got one from our buddy Steve who wrote in, wanted to...

24:27.305 --> 24:30.267
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually thank and congratulate us for keeping up with an awesome show.

24:30.627 --> 24:35.090
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you were one of the people who made our win at the podcast awards possible, so thank you.

24:36.591 --> 24:38.473
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I'm just going to go ahead and quote here.

24:38.493 --> 24:43.756
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to say the enthusiasm and overall appeal was particularly evident in this week's episode, the August 1st episode.

24:44.557 --> 24:49.961
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only did you break your old record for length, but you all seemed just so much more into the content, which was great to hear.

24:50.381 --> 24:51.422
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a reason for that.

24:52.242 --> 24:54.163
[SPEAKER_00]: We did the podcast on Saturday.

24:54.824 --> 24:55.765
[SPEAKER_00]: We did it early.

24:56.865 --> 25:00.328
[SPEAKER_00]: We were wide awake and not fresh from doing our three hour show.

25:00.448 --> 25:04.192
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we'll try to recreate that enthusiasm, don't you think?

25:05.273 --> 25:06.974
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we try to be very enthusiastic.

25:07.014 --> 25:11.018
[SPEAKER_03]: This week is hard because we're missing one of our co-hosts.

25:11.058 --> 25:16.783
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard to be enthusiastic on Sundays because you have to work on Mondays, but hey, whatever.

25:16.843 --> 25:17.243
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all good.

25:18.863 --> 25:24.704
[SPEAKER_00]: Another question he wanted to ask is, wanted to know what the background music during my Vice piece was.

25:25.445 --> 25:29.285
[SPEAKER_00]: To quote, it sounds fabulously happy, and I'd love to hear where it came from.

25:29.565 --> 25:31.946
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually Journey to Wonderland from Keyboard Mania.

25:32.526 --> 25:38.968
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we started off Bimani-themed, and that one just fits so many wrong things, and so many things it's more appropriate for.

25:40.348 --> 25:43.849
[SPEAKER_00]: But he wants to say once again, thanks for the excellent show, and hope you keep up the great work, guys.

25:44.989 --> 25:45.970
[SPEAKER_00]: We do our best.

25:46.190 --> 25:46.610
[SPEAKER_00]: We try.

25:46.870 --> 25:47.671
[SPEAKER_00]: We really try.

25:47.791 --> 25:48.732
[SPEAKER_00]: We're glad you love us.

25:50.533 --> 25:52.814
[SPEAKER_00]: And suddenly I'm reminded of the Quizness commercials.

25:52.874 --> 25:53.935
[SPEAKER_00]: We love the subs.

25:55.236 --> 25:57.357
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just very random today.

25:59.018 --> 26:04.042
[SPEAKER_00]: We also got one from a guy named Ben who said...

26:05.151 --> 26:09.574
[SPEAKER_00]: He actually became aware of us through DDR Freak.

26:11.135 --> 26:17.699
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually a moderator on DDR Freak, and all of us have frequented there in the past when we were strictly Just Bad Money related.

26:19.680 --> 26:24.263
[SPEAKER_00]: But he wrote in to say that he thought that Loki was great drunk.

26:26.765 --> 26:31.768
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, yes, the classic drunk episode, which we will be recreating the drunk episode on September 11th.

26:32.549 --> 26:34.873
[SPEAKER_03]: My birthday, which also happens to fall on a Sunday.

26:36.016 --> 26:37.478
[SPEAKER_03]: I will be drinking that day as well.

26:37.739 --> 26:44.091
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully this time not throwing up all over the place, but still as incoherent as usual.

26:46.078 --> 26:56.126
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what we might have to do, because it's still tentative, but I'm thinking about doing my friend-related wedding reception at Dave & Buster's on the 10th.

26:57.407 --> 27:02.491
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting everybody as intoxicated as possible and recording a drunken podcast from the middle of Dave & Buster's.

27:02.511 --> 27:03.392
[SPEAKER_00]: Wouldn't that be crazy?

27:05.213 --> 27:05.674
[SPEAKER_03]: Eh, maybe.

27:06.394 --> 27:07.175
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't want to drive.

27:09.472 --> 27:18.045
[SPEAKER_00]: He also wants to add in that Halo 2 isn't just another first-person shooter, and Grand Theft Auto San Andreas is a fucking great game, but it is not a revolution.

27:18.185 --> 27:18.826
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a great day.

27:20.548 --> 27:22.611
[SPEAKER_00]: I can agree with the latter statement, yeah.

27:23.012 --> 27:23.753
[SPEAKER_00]: I can agree with that.

27:25.395 --> 27:36.742
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, though, we have an interview posted with the Senior Vice President of Software for Square Enix, Hiroichi Tanaka.

27:38.103 --> 27:39.324
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a little bit about this.

27:39.344 --> 27:42.626
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to do more with Final Fantasy XI on the Xbox 360.

27:43.927 --> 27:48.090
[SPEAKER_00]: They said actually that it's very easy since the Xbox 360 uses DirectX.

27:48.850 --> 27:54.094
[SPEAKER_00]: It is going to run in time with the PlayStation and PC versions of Final Fantasy XI.

27:54.994 --> 28:04.999
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing about it though, where it will be using the 360's Xbox Live chat function, you will not be able to chat with people on the PC since it's only on the Xbox 360 servers.

28:05.860 --> 28:10.302
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not a built-in function of Final Fantasy XI, it's just accessing the 360 servers.

28:14.349 --> 28:21.535
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as the keyboard support, he says that Microsoft is thinking about adding a text input device separately.

28:22.096 --> 28:25.738
[SPEAKER_00]: But I remember Microsoft saying in the past that they were never going to do a keyboard.

28:27.100 --> 28:33.545
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they're doing a really ugly controller with a stupid QWERTY keyboard that's crammed onto it as well.

28:34.565 --> 28:34.806
[SPEAKER_03]: Ugly.

28:35.006 --> 28:36.447
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen the pictures of it.

28:37.270 --> 28:51.086
[SPEAKER_00]: but you know they had something like that before on GameCube for Phantasy Star Online but the thing is is that if they keep the controllers very similarly all they have to do is have the same keyboard adapter that Phantasy Star Online uses and then they don't have to do anything

28:51.854 --> 28:53.115
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't do anything anyways.

28:53.175 --> 28:55.657
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the Xbox 360, I'd imagine.

28:55.757 --> 28:56.258
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure.

28:56.598 --> 29:04.805
[SPEAKER_03]: I know the PlayStation 3 has USB ports and the Revolution is going to have the USB ports as well.

29:05.806 --> 29:09.609
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically, why not just sell a keyboard?

29:10.630 --> 29:14.353
[SPEAKER_03]: Either have it use a USB keyboard and mouse or...

29:15.100 --> 29:17.903
[SPEAKER_03]: I really think they should stick with what they did with Phantasy Star.

29:17.943 --> 29:22.647
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, another question asked is if it was going to be using the PlayOnline servers or the Microsoft servers.

29:22.707 --> 29:26.710
[SPEAKER_03]: It was specified they'll be using PlayOnline delays in development right now.

29:42.564 --> 29:46.588
[SPEAKER_00]: is that they have the window specifics up but are still working on Japanese character input.

29:46.848 --> 29:50.692
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a really funky screenshot on here where one of the characters, you can't see his face.

29:51.153 --> 29:52.394
[SPEAKER_00]: His face is totally not rendered.

29:53.635 --> 29:58.480
[SPEAKER_00]: About as far as if it's going to cost the same as the other versions or a different fee,

29:59.000 --> 30:28.302
[SPEAKER_00]: they have not yet decided but also North American audiences do get to beta test Final Fantasy XI on Xbox 360 first since the 360 will be released here beta testing will be free when you get the Xbox 360 you'll be able to apply for the beta test as far as anything else though they're looking to sell for about $29 and I don't really see anything else major about that

30:31.089 --> 30:34.672
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, we're all on the topic of the 360 once again.

30:36.273 --> 30:41.838
[SPEAKER_03]: The question that's on everybody's mind, will the old games play on the new systems?

30:44.688 --> 30:48.990
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Xbox says, eh, maybe.

30:49.850 --> 30:53.751
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, what's going to happen is only some games will be able to play.

30:54.132 --> 30:55.432
[SPEAKER_03]: Why, you may ask?

30:55.552 --> 31:03.095
[SPEAKER_03]: Because unlike the PlayStation 3, which actually uses, you know, they put the actual old chips on there, so it's not actual emulation.

31:03.155 --> 31:04.635
[SPEAKER_03]: It's playing straight out the old chips.

31:05.376 --> 31:10.958
[SPEAKER_03]: The Xbox, being that this brand new system is built on the NVIDIA graphics card,

31:11.918 --> 31:13.459
[SPEAKER_03]: The old one was built on ATI.

31:13.479 --> 31:16.000
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh-oh, that's a problem.

31:16.460 --> 31:19.181
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, so they're going to have to emulate it.

31:19.601 --> 31:22.823
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically only some games will work with the emulation.

31:23.543 --> 31:26.444
[SPEAKER_03]: However, it's going to be decided case by case.

31:26.524 --> 31:28.405
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually it's going to be the most popular games.

31:29.245 --> 31:37.669
[SPEAKER_03]: It says right now they're predicting that the numbers could be somewhere between 5 and 20 of the games will be backwards compatible.

31:38.655 --> 32:01.151
[SPEAKER_03]: which that's kind of crappy if you ask me but supposedly I guess if you maybe if you get Xbox Live or something like that maybe they'll add more but fine let me come on now and they're not even selling Xboxes right now either they've stopped production on Xboxes for the 360 to get it ready for launch that's gonna fuck over a lot of players right now that's what I think

32:03.318 --> 32:08.368
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the point of even having backwards playability if it's only going to work for five games?

32:08.388 --> 32:10.372
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of retarded.

32:11.354 --> 32:12.957
[SPEAKER_03]: That's lame, but that's what they're doing.

32:14.978 --> 32:18.140
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds like a bunch of geniuses over Microsoft, doesn't it?

32:20.001 --> 32:30.366
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as other news, I'm sure that everybody who's listened to the show for a while knew that I was pretty excited about the Gizmondo coming out, putting up by Tiger Telematics.

32:30.986 --> 32:37.910
[SPEAKER_00]: However, they have requested or are looking for 50,000 units from the Gizmondo manufacturer.

32:39.310 --> 32:41.512
[SPEAKER_00]: However, they're saying that there are...

32:43.073 --> 33:07.212
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're also saying that numerous USA retailers intend to stock the product so they're working on a press release however the system has been delayed they're actually they said that they have an unannounced highly significant game title for release but there's not really anything else saying on here looking for it looks like later on this month but it's we're supposed to be receiving more information over the next few weeks

33:09.426 --> 33:18.897
[SPEAKER_03]: And in other news I'd like to classify as too little too late, the Nokia N-Gage QD has announced that they're going to be releasing a silver-colored version.

33:20.398 --> 33:23.442
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, the silver-colored version will not make it suck any less.

33:24.417 --> 33:24.938
[SPEAKER_03]: Back to you!

33:42.401 --> 33:44.223
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, I love how this is described.

33:44.263 --> 33:46.464
[SPEAKER_00]: Super fast action and irreverent humor.

33:47.045 --> 33:49.266
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it's being released in the smaller format.

33:49.307 --> 33:55.211
[SPEAKER_00]: The game features 13 levels and maintains a faithful conversion of the style of the game.

33:55.291 --> 33:59.254
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no plans for a US release that have yet been announced.

33:59.535 --> 34:03.978
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm sure we're going to eventually get it, because there's hardly anything we don't eventually get.

34:04.438 --> 34:06.660
[SPEAKER_00]: However, fair play to you.

34:06.700 --> 34:07.461
[SPEAKER_00]: You get it first.

34:09.207 --> 34:11.350
[SPEAKER_03]: I want them to release Seven Sins over here.

34:11.510 --> 34:17.757
[SPEAKER_03]: That's something that the UK has that we need to have so that they go ballistic over that one, because that's all it is, is full-on sex.

34:18.738 --> 34:19.659
[SPEAKER_03]: What about the Playboy game?

34:19.699 --> 34:21.421
[SPEAKER_03]: I never see them coming after the Playboy game.

34:23.217 --> 34:28.021
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that all those people trying to censor our games and everything need to get that pine tree out their ass.

34:28.041 --> 34:29.423
[SPEAKER_00]: Those roots are starting to stick out their mouth.

34:30.604 --> 34:34.487
[SPEAKER_03]: The problem is, is us gamers don't really have any way we can combat this.

34:34.687 --> 34:38.671
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, you know, it's all these politicians and, you know, law people.

34:38.711 --> 34:40.513
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just, you know, kind of coming after us.

34:40.833 --> 34:44.596
[SPEAKER_03]: This lawyer, first off, he needs to go up against some of these companies.

34:44.636 --> 34:47.479
[SPEAKER_03]: And we need some of these companies to stand up to him and just say, fuck off.

34:47.839 --> 34:51.300
[SPEAKER_03]: because you're retarded and just fight them and make them lose in court.

34:51.900 --> 34:58.743
[SPEAKER_02]: But then you have the whiny mothers there just, you know, oh my kid, oh my god, he could have possibly been exposed to this.

34:59.003 --> 35:05.365
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm suing you because he might have been exposed to this even though I don't know he was because I wasn't monitoring what he's playing and yeah.

35:06.886 --> 35:13.208
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing though that I like to keep in mind to put all of this into perspective, we are the gaming generation.

35:13.908 --> 35:16.249
[SPEAKER_00]: Our numbers are increasing daily.

35:17.404 --> 35:26.166
[SPEAKER_00]: Before too long, these gamers are going to grow up, and they're going to be the ones having the kids, and we're going to be the ones making the decisions, and we're going to be the ones with the power.

35:27.927 --> 35:34.189
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it 10, 15 years, they're going to be sitting in their wheelchairs going, We lost!

35:34.289 --> 35:36.929
[SPEAKER_00]: The gamers grew up and kicked our asses!

35:37.530 --> 35:38.690
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, I'm waiting for that.

35:39.710 --> 35:43.911
[SPEAKER_00]: We just have to keep in mind, and I love that we have this format that we can reach so many people.

35:44.391 --> 35:46.012
[SPEAKER_00]: Go out and spread the word, seriously.

35:46.932 --> 35:53.195
[SPEAKER_00]: The next parent you see bitching about this, tell them, hey, look, the FBI says crime has gone down.

35:53.535 --> 36:00.798
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to make sure that you do your research before you start affecting other people's livelihoods by trying to shut them down.

36:00.858 --> 36:06.781
[SPEAKER_00]: These are people trying to earn money and pay for their kids' educations and take care of their families just the same as you.

36:08.261 --> 36:11.623
[SPEAKER_00]: They're doing this because they're selfish and they don't feel like raising their own children.

36:12.824 --> 36:14.945
[SPEAKER_00]: We need more people to get the word out there.

36:15.005 --> 36:15.885
[SPEAKER_00]: Parents, do your job.

36:16.125 --> 36:17.706
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to start a campaign right now.

36:18.166 --> 36:20.227
[SPEAKER_00]: Parents, do your fucking job campaign.

36:21.007 --> 36:24.829
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go out there and protest in front of PTA meetings and stuff.

36:25.169 --> 36:25.850
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I should do that.

36:25.870 --> 36:26.330
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be great.

36:27.574 --> 36:28.955
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

36:45.845 --> 36:54.011
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't see what the big deal is with, you know, violence or sex in an R-rated movie, which, I might add, is okay for a 17-year-old to go see.

36:54.672 --> 36:55.012
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay?

36:55.372 --> 36:56.193
[SPEAKER_03]: It's okay for that.

36:56.293 --> 37:05.100
[SPEAKER_03]: But you don't ever hear anymore of people going, Oh, well, I brought my kid to that, you know, movie, and there was full-on sex in it.

37:05.120 --> 37:10.464
[SPEAKER_03]: It was rated R. I'm gonna sue you because I didn't know there was sex in this movie.

37:11.792 --> 37:12.573
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

37:35.709 --> 37:57.496
[SPEAKER_00]: you will go for the extra effort it takes to see what they're getting into before laying down the money because the moment that that money leaves your hand and pays for that game just at that moment not even when you sit your children down to play the game the moment you purchase it that is the moment that you take 100% responsibility for what your child sees you are the only one to blame

37:59.215 --> 38:10.161
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we should just have all parents sign off on a little form when they buy their game that's mature rated that says, I fully acknowledge the content in this game is inappropriate for anybody under the age of 17.

38:10.461 --> 38:21.288
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I am wholly responsible if anybody under the age of 17 is playing this in my presence and any actions or, you know, that result of them playing this.

38:22.188 --> 38:33.875
[SPEAKER_03]: and then when they go, I didn't know that that game was violent even though big content warnings on the front, I'm going to see you and they're like, fuck you, you signed the contract, shove it up your ass.

38:35.151 --> 38:39.115
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what's funny is that I deal with that daily since I work in the mortgage industry.

38:39.816 --> 38:43.179
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know that I had to have insurance on my house.

38:43.319 --> 38:43.639
[SPEAKER_00]: Bitch!

38:43.980 --> 38:44.961
[SPEAKER_00]: You signed that form.

38:44.981 --> 38:46.002
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to have insurance.

38:46.442 --> 38:46.862
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing.

38:46.902 --> 38:47.963
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a great idea.

38:48.524 --> 38:52.688
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there should be disclaimers that people sign when they buy adult-only and M-rated games.

38:53.189 --> 38:54.630
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a brilliant idea.

38:54.670 --> 38:56.872
[SPEAKER_00]: We should definitely write our congressman to lobby for that.

38:57.813 --> 38:58.013
[SPEAKER_00]: So...

39:00.095 --> 39:06.341
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other thing, too, about Killer7, and I'd like to backtrack a little bit, how they're saying that, you know, this has full-on sex stuff.

39:07.062 --> 39:09.544
[SPEAKER_03]: Before the game even starts, there's a little warning that comes up.

39:09.705 --> 39:14.810
[SPEAKER_03]: This game contains violent content and some nudity.

39:15.770 --> 39:17.332
[SPEAKER_03]: Parental discretion advised.

39:17.592 --> 39:20.855
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, full-on on there, you have to hit a button to go through it, okay?

39:22.106 --> 39:28.449
[SPEAKER_03]: What more do these game companies need to do for you fucking people?

39:30.170 --> 39:32.551
[SPEAKER_03]: What does it take for you to need to do your own job?

39:33.432 --> 39:36.813
[SPEAKER_03]: What do they need to do before you start being responsible?

39:38.214 --> 39:38.574
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing.

39:38.634 --> 39:39.735
[SPEAKER_03]: There's nothing they can do.

39:40.255 --> 39:46.278
[SPEAKER_03]: You want the government to come in and do your job for you so you can go kick back and get drunk and wasted and stuff and have more kids.

39:46.318 --> 39:48.539
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably the same way you had your kids in the first place.

39:49.280 --> 39:49.480
[SPEAKER_03]: So,

39:50.822 --> 40:01.385
[SPEAKER_03]: What comes down to is, when I have my kids, I'll be watching what they're playing, and honestly, I don't mind if they play the mature games because I'll be teaching them the difference between right and wrong in the first place.

40:01.685 --> 40:08.386
[SPEAKER_03]: And they know that this is a game, it's fictional, it does not play in the real world, it's just like a fantasy movie.

40:09.267 --> 40:09.727
[SPEAKER_03]: The end.

40:09.807 --> 40:10.887
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what it's going to come down to.

40:12.205 --> 40:18.167
[SPEAKER_00]: I really think in the end it really has more to do... You know, also these parents need to give their kids a little bit more credit.

40:18.607 --> 40:21.068
[SPEAKER_00]: Your children are not stupid in most cases.

40:21.448 --> 40:23.909
[SPEAKER_00]: They only become stupid after you teach them how to be.

40:24.550 --> 40:30.012
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, your children are most likely going to know the difference between fiction and reality.

40:30.412 --> 40:35.694
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they don't, then you need to take them to the psychologist or you need to go to parenting school or something.

40:36.074 --> 40:37.895
[SPEAKER_00]: Because then there's some seriously messed up issues.

40:38.515 --> 40:38.715
[SPEAKER_00]: But...

40:39.255 --> 40:57.809
[SPEAKER_00]: you know in the end parents need to give their children a little bit more credit and they need to take more responsibility for what their children do for what their children learn that's called parenting letting the government do it lobbying you know they're spending all this you know it's almost like that episode of South Park you remember with the when they were trying to take Terrence and Phillip off the air

40:58.970 --> 41:23.872
[SPEAKER_00]: and their children were talking about getting into drugs and I hear smoking crack is kind of cute you know and watching porn movies while their parents backs were turned and they were so busy focusing on this one issue you know that's not parenting you need to actually take an active part in your children's lives and say hey this is what I think that they should do this is how I feel they should be raised

41:24.252 --> 41:24.933
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the end of it.

41:25.153 --> 41:29.896
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we're kind of going off on this one, but it's really, I think, a repeating theme for the show, don't you?

41:31.598 --> 41:40.024
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and I think on that note, we'll call this episode of Orange Laundry Ready to Go a close.

41:40.744 --> 41:41.985
[SPEAKER_03]: Final thoughts, DarkSakura?

41:43.346 --> 41:45.408
[SPEAKER_00]: I like fire and reject false icons.

41:47.182 --> 42:05.722
[SPEAKER_03]: my final thought is I have too many games to play and too little time and Graffiti Kingdom better come out this week or so help me God I will come after that company and I will kill them I will kill them for every I will kill them one time for every day they're late over and over and over again
