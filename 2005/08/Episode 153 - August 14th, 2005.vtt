After taking last week kind of a mini vacation

04:37.960 --> 04:45.220
I mean there was still a show, but it wasn't the show show right there you were there, but it wasn't the OLR experience

04:45.220 --> 04:47.220
So to say it was the

04:51.520 --> 04:54.060
So it was the let's multitask show no

Anyway tonight though I'm back after being gone for two weeks because I know there was a show a couple weeks ago

05:00.040 --> 05:04.260
Oh, but enjoy your box. I enjoyed the FedEx box immensely. I was popping on the bubble wrap

05:04.380 --> 05:08.320
So on tonight's show, we're gonna talk about my East Coast tournament

05:08.320 --> 05:11.640
I went to I went to an East Coast tournament and I saw in the group, too

05:12.160 --> 05:17.360
So I can't wait to talk about that. And also we're going to talk about the the DDR with fire

05:18.840 --> 05:24.040
Dark soccer's favorite thing DDR with fire. It's actually called dance simulation

05:24.040 --> 05:25.720

11:52.140 --> 11:53.540

11:53.540 --> 11:55.640
I gotta know if it's real

12:25.640 --> 12:28.200
I used to drive a love for you

12:29.100 --> 12:32.300
I'm giving you my heart I love, my love

12:32.520 --> 12:34.980
I used to drive a love for you

12:35.940 --> 12:39.280
I'm giving all myclears to you, my love

12:39.360 --> 12:41.720
I used to drive a love for you

12:42.860 --> 12:46.080
I'm giving you my heart I love, my love

12:46.080 --> 12:49.080
I used to burn my love for you

13:16.080 --> 13:20.080
I don't wanna play

13:20.080 --> 13:23.080
I don't wanna play

13:23.080 --> 13:30.080
Like those on the way back to back to back to back to back to back

14:30.080 --> 14:35.080
I know, but I'm afraid, where are we going?

14:35.080 --> 14:39.080
into the dark black forest.

15:35.080 --> 16:04.080
into the dark black forest.

16:04.080 --> 16:08.080
Orange Lounge Radio. We put your thing down, flip it, and reverse it.

16:08.080 --> 16:13.080
This server made a bit of my head numb. This server made a bit of my head numb.

16:13.080 --> 16:16.980
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio,

16:16.980 --> 16:20.380
episode number 153 in progress.

16:20.380 --> 16:23.440
How are you guys doing tonight? I'm back.

16:23.440 --> 16:27.180
I'm back for my trip that I went to the East Coast. I was sent in FedEx packaging

16:27.180 --> 16:30.980
courtesy of Loki and Dark Sakura. I'm glad that they treated you well.

16:30.980 --> 16:39.980
You know, they actually lost some of our shipments the other week so I was like, hey, he might be gone. We might never get him back.

16:39.980 --> 16:46.980
Actually, FedEx was full so I had to suffer a fate worse than FedEx. I had to fly southwest.

16:46.980 --> 16:55.980
That makes no sense. Southwest does not fly east. I mean, that's northeast. That's the complete opposite of southwest.

16:55.980 --> 17:01.060
ironic Southwest actually flies to the northeast now and that's how I got to

17:01.060 --> 17:06.820
where I was going so but oh lord try spending five hours on a plane with

17:06.820 --> 17:11.340
grandpa who's really really obese I mean you know not that there's anything wrong

17:11.340 --> 17:14.580
with being really obese but when you're trying to sit next to me on a plane it's

17:14.580 --> 17:19.660
like you know I've got no wiggle room whatsoever in flight movies it's

17:19.660 --> 17:24.660
Southwest there is no in-flight movies there's when you bring a laptop yeah I

17:24.660 --> 17:25.780
I brought my PSP.

17:25.780 --> 17:29.060
I'm going to talk about that on the podcast, because I did bring my PSP.

17:29.060 --> 17:32.220
And Sharks Girl, if you're out there, I love you,

17:32.220 --> 17:34.900
because she loaned me movies I could watch on my PSP.

17:34.900 --> 17:39.180
And I've always knocked the idea of movies on a PSP,

17:39.180 --> 17:41.100
but I take it all back after this trip.

17:41.100 --> 17:42.100
I take it all back.

17:42.100 --> 17:43.140
I'm so sorry.

17:43.140 --> 17:46.620
I'm so, so sorry for those comments, because seriously, it

17:46.620 --> 17:47.940
saved my ass this week.

17:47.940 --> 17:50.540
So I'm very happy.

17:50.540 --> 17:54.100
So my in-flight movies were Tron on the way over, which, believe it or not,

17:54.100 --> 18:01.080
never seen before and I robot on the way back on piss the PSP so but it didn't

18:01.080 --> 18:03.940
stop this grandpa guy from trying to talk to me in his little not just

18:03.940 --> 18:07.600
grandpa but the daughter or the grand and the daughter the granddaughter it

18:07.600 --> 18:12.820
was in sixth grade that was kind of one of those like scary-looking children

18:12.820 --> 18:17.280
that kept showing off her little laptop computer quote-unquote and it wasn't a

18:17.280 --> 18:21.440
laptop computer so much as it was one of those computers that you get at Walmart

18:21.440 --> 18:29.200
that's like you know my child's first computer I don't know how it's okay just

18:29.200 --> 18:32.460
like have you ever seen the video player they sell at Walmart that they have the

18:32.460 --> 18:38.240
CD and the tiny ass little screen that is really all black and white some of

18:38.240 --> 18:40.720
them are all black why I think they have the color died I can't even think of the

18:40.720 --> 18:44.440
name of these things but the tiny ass screen if you thought watching a movie

18:44.440 --> 18:47.720
on your PSP was that these things have the tiniest screen in the world the

18:47.720 --> 18:52.760
the quality just stinks, but this is, I don't know. Anyway, so she was showing off her computer

18:52.760 --> 18:57.400
to me and kept asking questions about the PSP and I'm just like, leave me alone.

18:57.400 --> 19:01.440
You pretended you didn't speak English. That's what I need to do next time.

19:01.440 --> 19:06.340
To bludgeon her to death with the PSP. That's why I need to go see that movie, Red

19:06.340 --> 19:10.960
Eye, because maybe I'll get some ideas from that movie for the next time I go. So we'll

19:10.960 --> 19:13.280
see. I don't know if we should support any more

19:13.280 --> 19:18.720
of Wes Craven's, uh, you know, stuff. I mean, come on. Do we need to really inspire him

19:18.720 --> 19:23.400
to make more Nightmare on Elm Street movies? Yes, we do. Yes, we do. And we also need to

19:23.400 --> 19:27.960
inspire him to make a Scream 4, because I didn't think that those movies were going

19:27.960 --> 19:32.560
to be missed at all, but now that they're gone and there's really not been a lot of

19:32.560 --> 19:37.120
good horror movies, I kind of miss them. Exactly. And what, what will a scary movie parody on

19:37.120 --> 19:43.360
if they don't make any more screen movies I don't know I don't know all

19:43.360 --> 19:47.640
right anyway um let's start off tonight show us we do every week with a little

19:47.640 --> 19:51.280
bit of how is your week how is your day starting off with the one and only dark

19:51.280 --> 20:00.800
Sakura my week was busy busy busy at work I really have been trying to get

20:00.800 --> 20:03.320
stuff together because I'm starting school next week so I didn't really get

20:03.320 --> 20:10.080
play too much except for a little PSO and trying to get Ragnarok to install, but for

20:10.080 --> 20:13.400
some reason the Korean Ragnarok won't install on my computer.

20:13.400 --> 20:14.920
Is it because it's Korean?

20:14.920 --> 20:16.560
Possibly, honestly.

20:16.560 --> 20:20.860
I think that they've upgraded on the newest build, so I need a really old build of it.

20:20.860 --> 20:25.680
I seem to recall that the Korean, because I think you tried to get me, no, who tried

20:25.680 --> 20:27.120
to get me to install this once?

20:27.120 --> 20:30.480
Somebody was getting me to install the Korean one so that I could patch it to play on a

20:30.480 --> 20:31.480
free server.

20:31.480 --> 20:37.820
style because he's all into that if you think a Loki is a pirate hey hang out

20:37.820 --> 20:41.980
with lanky style sometime this would this see the written you read Ragnarok

20:41.980 --> 20:46.780
online it's so advanced it bans you before you even decide the play stop it

20:46.780 --> 20:51.100
anyway I don't want to cut off dark Sakura but I tried to install it once it

20:51.100 --> 20:54.860
was a pain in the ass like I had to do all these special things can't initialize

20:54.860 --> 20:58.860
So I need to figure out how to get past that.

20:58.860 --> 21:02.860
Anyway, it's just really been...

21:02.860 --> 21:06.860
I can't find my Illustrator book, which means I might have to buy another one

21:06.860 --> 21:10.860
if I can't find it by Monday. Like Adobe Illustrator? Yeah, because one of my classes

21:10.860 --> 21:14.860
is Illustrator, the other one is Geography, and then halfway through the next semester

21:14.860 --> 21:18.860
I'm taking Dreamweaver and

21:18.860 --> 21:22.860
what's the other...oh yeah, my other technical writing class

21:22.860 --> 21:26.400
with a teacher who says I have flawless writing. Which means Dark Soccer is going to be doing

21:26.400 --> 21:29.880
our site and all the graphics as soon as she graduates school.

21:29.880 --> 21:35.000
Maybe before then. Or the Orange Lounge site might start becoming homework for me.

21:35.000 --> 21:40.340
Um, also, um, sort of a half plug for Pump Up the Volume.

21:40.340 --> 21:43.420
Um, in a couple weeks I'm going to be, uh,

21:43.420 --> 21:46.060
doing a demo for Dark Records.

21:46.060 --> 21:50.780
They just went live this week and, uh, but, you know, friends of mine are behind that.

21:50.780 --> 21:53.180
And since I always try to play new music for everybody.

21:53.180 --> 21:56.080
We can say the familiar DDR face that's behind a lot of this, right?

21:56.080 --> 22:03.280
Well, my iguana girl is working with them, but they're people that, you know, I used to work with one of them.

22:03.280 --> 22:08.280
I haven't, I think a lot of this has developed while I was kind of on vacation and tuned out of the world,

22:08.280 --> 22:11.480
but so what's going on there? They're making their own label type thing?

22:11.480 --> 22:17.180
It's a label. They're putting out the first record as a compilation of just different artists in the community.

22:17.180 --> 22:21.660
So I'm going to be playing all that since I play new music on my show when I can.

22:21.660 --> 22:23.740
Right, and isn't it like Synthpop, some of it?

22:23.740 --> 22:25.420
Some Synthpop, Goth Industrial.

22:25.420 --> 22:25.980
Cool.

22:25.980 --> 22:29.740
Pretty, pretty variant stuff across the Angst written level.

22:29.740 --> 22:33.020
So possible UltraMix 4 music, some way.

22:33.020 --> 22:33.500
Maybe.

22:33.500 --> 22:34.620
You never know, you never know.

22:34.620 --> 22:35.340
Well that's kind of cool.

22:36.860 --> 22:38.620
All the rest of it, we bought furniture today.

22:40.380 --> 22:44.940
Dan bribed me with a bass guitar, which I'm not getting, I'm going to have,

22:44.940 --> 22:47.740
I'm actually going to pay a trainer instead.

22:47.740 --> 22:49.900
How exactly do you get bribed with a bass guitar?

22:49.900 --> 22:53.180
Because I like the furniture first because it's red suede.

22:53.180 --> 22:55.860
But we ended up buying it anyway.

22:55.860 --> 23:01.700
We got a big chaise lounge and an AI couch and we're going to get back and get end tables

23:01.700 --> 23:02.700
for it and everything.

23:02.700 --> 23:04.980
It's comfy and suede.

23:04.980 --> 23:07.460
And the cat is not allowed anywhere near it.

23:07.460 --> 23:09.160
And Shermy stopped puking.

23:09.160 --> 23:10.160
That's good.

23:10.160 --> 23:11.160
What happened with your kitty?

23:11.160 --> 23:12.160
Cat flew.

23:12.160 --> 23:13.160
We think she had West Nile.

23:13.160 --> 23:20.800
Someone I know had it. Really? Yes. Oh my gosh. She said it felt like having

23:20.800 --> 23:24.880
like a regular, you know, head flu and the stomach flu at the same time. For those that

23:24.880 --> 23:28.880
are outside the Sacramento area, this has been big news. No, it's all over the country.

23:28.880 --> 23:32.600
Oh, I thought it was just Sacramento had a problem. Oh, no, no. One of my good friends

23:32.600 --> 23:37.440
lives in the D.C. area. She knew people who had it. Really? They're spraying out there

23:37.440 --> 23:41.040
too and the spray makes her sick. I thought the spray was only happening out here. No,

23:41.040 --> 23:42.480
This is all over the country.

23:42.480 --> 23:43.280
Oh, dang.

23:43.280 --> 23:44.200
Shows how much I know.

23:44.200 --> 23:47.880
And typically in more humid areas, but still.

23:47.880 --> 23:49.520
That would not be Sacramento.

23:49.520 --> 23:52.480
I know, but we also do have a floodplain.

23:52.480 --> 23:55.800
And standing water does pool.

23:55.800 --> 24:00.560
But anyway, what I was trying to say about that

24:00.560 --> 24:02.440
is I don't know if it's possible.

24:02.440 --> 24:06.080
Maybe Shirmi might have had some type of variant or something,

24:06.080 --> 24:08.800
because she would eat, and then throw up, and then

24:08.800 --> 24:10.080
cry pathetically.

24:10.080 --> 24:12.760
You want to hear something really gross about what I got from a bug once?

24:12.760 --> 24:13.760
What?

24:13.760 --> 24:17.600
Okay, I once fell asleep on my couch, like out in the living room or something.

24:17.600 --> 24:18.900
This was when I was living in Chico.

24:18.900 --> 24:21.640
And I think I fell asleep with my mouth like open.

24:21.640 --> 24:23.560
You know how some people like have their mouths open a little bit?

24:23.560 --> 24:27.360
Well, I think a bug got in there and bit me on my gums.

24:27.360 --> 24:32.160
Because the next day my gums swelled up hella big, and like they were like bleeding and

24:32.160 --> 24:33.160
stuff.

24:33.160 --> 24:35.680
And it's, like imagine if you didn't brush your teeth for like a year.

24:35.680 --> 24:39.420
Sounds like, you're almost describing scurvy.

24:39.420 --> 24:46.000
I caught scurvy and see deficiency Wow and your teeth start falling out and

24:46.000 --> 24:48.660
your gums start to buzz you know my teeth didn't fall out and everything

24:48.660 --> 24:52.560
went away like three days later but it was really disgusting during the process

24:52.560 --> 24:54.520
and that was the only thing I could think of is that I must have been bitten

24:54.520 --> 24:58.480
by bug because he gets I there was one part of it was slightly swollen so I

24:58.480 --> 25:01.260
think it was a bug bite it was like very much similar to a mosquito bite it's

25:01.260 --> 25:05.760
really good icky poo yeah anyway just thought I'd share fun enjoy that lovely

25:05.760 --> 25:14.520
image America um otherwise I had just been busy busy busy busy sorry no that's

25:14.520 --> 25:19.480
all right I've been sleepy all day I had coffee I didn't do anything I slept for 12

25:19.480 --> 25:26.720
hours last night mr. jet lag yeah well not just that but the fact that I was up

25:26.720 --> 25:30.760
from 1 a.m. West Coast time now granted I got to sleep for about an hour and a

25:30.760 --> 25:33.760
half on the plane but I stayed up till midnight last night so it's almost up

25:33.760 --> 25:39.520
like 24 hours, almost. So, I was definitely on second wind last night. Anyway, anything

25:39.520 --> 25:40.520
else, DarkSakura?

25:40.520 --> 25:41.520
No.

25:41.520 --> 25:44.400
Okay. Loki, how was your week? How was your day?

25:44.400 --> 25:51.080
My week was okay. It started off actually decent. I don't know, I could say my week

25:51.080 --> 25:55.260
has been okay. Nellie's week has been kind of on the rocks. First, she started off her

25:55.260 --> 25:57.280
week by having her car stolen.

25:57.280 --> 25:58.280
That sucks.

25:58.280 --> 26:03.280
And, yeah, so I've had to drive her around places and stuff. And then, she found a wedding

26:03.280 --> 26:08.840
dress yesterday so that was kind of cool and otherwise what I've been doing this

26:08.840 --> 26:14.640
week has been utilizing the internet for my advantage that's the best way to put

26:14.640 --> 26:19.080
it and because of that I have gotten to play so many damn games it's not even

26:19.080 --> 26:25.920
funny and oh yesterday I went and bought a DVD burner because I had to upgrade my

26:25.920 --> 26:31.400
pirating ability to be able to burn DVDs that and just I need it for wedding

26:31.400 --> 26:37.740
stuff as well. And then, so I had to install my CD burner into my mom's computer, which

26:37.740 --> 26:43.500
I'm sure she'll be grateful for, but she won't know how to use. And, yeah, it's pretty much

26:43.500 --> 26:48.820
been that, and I signed up for Usenet, and I got to download files and porn it ten times

26:48.820 --> 26:49.820
faster than normal.

26:49.820 --> 26:54.420
It took you this long to get on. Usenet, by the way, has been around for, what, fifteen

26:54.420 --> 26:55.420
years? So you're finally on board?

26:55.420 --> 26:59.220
Yeah, but, see, the only thing that I hesitated about Usenet is because it costs money. It's

26:59.220 --> 27:04.640
$15 a month for the service that I have which is unlimited but it's unlimited

27:04.640 --> 27:10.640
bandwidth but it's like $14.95 a month and then the weather server thing I'm on

27:10.640 --> 27:18.660
which is a basically a list is 50 cents a month I think and so you know I just

27:18.660 --> 27:22.520
basically sign up for that I'm gonna try it out for a month you know if it's

27:22.520 --> 27:25.380
something I'm interested in then yeah I'll go for probably not though because

27:25.380 --> 27:29.820
they don't have everything I'm looking for on there and just you know it's nice

27:29.820 --> 27:35.040
because I get I can download files really fast but you know I I love it by

27:35.040 --> 27:39.620
the way that you refuse to pay for anything but you'll pay for the program

27:39.620 --> 27:44.900
to let you buy all this software. But if you think about it though because I I've been

27:44.900 --> 27:48.240
like trying to get I'm speaking of which I'm getting back into the music stuff I

27:48.240 --> 27:52.940
bought two sample CDs I bought one sample CD from BT which is $100 I bought

27:52.940 --> 27:58.220
another one or I'm bidding on one that started off at $39.99 I don't get you

27:58.220 --> 28:01.580
because when you do spend money you spend like a hundred dollars on a

28:01.580 --> 28:08.780
fucking CD two CDs oh my bad my bad two CDs well it's because I can't get it

28:08.780 --> 28:13.700
anywhere else it's no longer being made it's not on anywhere trust me I've

28:13.700 --> 28:18.260
looked at all the free angles for this first before I go and actually buy

28:18.260 --> 28:22.100
something like this they're just not selling it anymore so I want to get

28:22.100 --> 28:27.100
Because BT's the fucking man when it comes to, you know, awesome break beats and that type of stuff.

28:27.100 --> 28:31.100
And so I have, like, one CD's basically all drum loops and stuff.

28:31.100 --> 28:34.100
The other one's all kind of like, you know, ambient sound kind of crap.

28:34.100 --> 28:39.100
So I got those. Well, I got the one at least. I don't know about the other one. I still have to wait on that.

28:39.100 --> 28:45.100
And then just pretty much waiting for that stuff to come in and audio software stuff, which is worth over $2,000.

28:45.100 --> 28:51.100
Anyways, but I'm merely trying it out. I will delete it after 24 hours.

28:51.100 --> 28:52.400
Yeah, sure you will. Yeah, okay.

28:52.400 --> 28:55.200
No, but honestly, um, what a load of crap is that, too?

28:55.200 --> 29:00.200
Who said that that is a law, that you can download the program as long as you delete it within 24 hours?

29:00.200 --> 29:02.200
Somebody made that shit up, you know it.

29:02.200 --> 29:05.600
I'm- I'm just trying this stuff out. I mean, yeah.

29:05.600 --> 29:09.100
So, I've- I've been having a lot of fun with my HD loader, and that's all I have to say.

29:09.100 --> 29:14.800
I still think that you should tell all those people who say that using acid sucks to go, you know, bite your ass or something.

29:14.800 --> 29:18.100
Well, that's why I'm gonna create some good music with acid.

29:18.100 --> 29:20.100
Bite you with the good samples, because I'm lazy.

29:20.100 --> 29:25.100
There was my point though. DJ Danger Mouse uses acid.

29:25.100 --> 29:32.100
Absolutely. For those that don't, or are kind of newer listeners to this show that don't know about the acid debate,

29:32.100 --> 29:34.100
Bimani Style once had a remix contest a while ago.

29:34.100 --> 29:36.100
They have a remix contest going on now.

29:36.100 --> 29:39.100
Well, they don't have anything going on now because their site's been down a couple of days.

29:39.100 --> 29:41.100
It was up this morning.

29:41.100 --> 29:45.100
Maybe it's up again. I don't know. But anyway, they had a remix contest a while back and they said,

29:45.100 --> 29:49.560
said no mashups and nothing done in acid type thing right and so come to find out

29:49.560 --> 29:54.020
like a bunch of popular DJ shoes acid we got MIDI head on the show asked him how

29:54.020 --> 29:59.860
he did his remixes for Ultramix 2 and he said acid now to be fair he else sees

29:59.860 --> 30:04.180
his free loops but who can buy they're both the same damn program I mean

30:04.180 --> 30:10.340
honestly they're very similar so who cares but yeah so that's basically is my

30:10.340 --> 30:13.860
my week it's been a lot of downloading and a lot of Nelly yelling at me get

30:13.860 --> 30:20.860
Question from chat, are you still relenting over graffiti kingdom?

30:43.860 --> 30:49.340
a very interesting day because I left Philadelphia in the morning. I stopped in Phoenix for a

30:49.340 --> 30:53.340
three hour layover. I ended up doing lunch with our webmaster, VX JasonXV, because I

30:53.340 --> 30:57.860
happen to be in Phoenix. So that's just kind of neat. I did lunch in Phoenix and then came

30:57.860 --> 31:02.780
home. So it was an interesting day yesterday. Of course, I've been doing a lot of work related,

31:02.780 --> 31:07.340
and when I say work, I mean my actual day job. You know I actually had somebody, a recent

31:07.340 --> 31:11.380
person that I added to LiveJournal recently, like a recent LiveJournal friend, asked if

31:11.380 --> 31:15.180
I did the podcasting thing for a living because I talked so much about it. I was like, oh,

31:15.180 --> 31:23.620
I wish. I wish we did the podcasting for a living. But no, I haven't quite quit my job.

31:23.620 --> 31:29.020
Never mind. I'll say it after the show. All right. So what was I going to say along

31:29.020 --> 31:33.620
those lines? Oh, so I have a real job and my real job sent me away for two weeks because

31:33.620 --> 31:40.460
I had some stuff I had to do in the Philadelphia area. So while I was out there, I ended up

31:40.460 --> 31:46.220
getting to go to a tournament in Jersey at 8 on the Break in Dunellen, a little town

31:46.220 --> 31:50.060
there. So I went there and it was actually an In the Groove 2 tournament. Actually they

31:50.060 --> 31:53.320
had a lot of games going on, but when I got there it was kind of In the Groove 2 Perfect

31:53.320 --> 31:57.480
Attack was going on. So I actually got to see In the Groove 2. Now I promised the folks

31:57.480 --> 32:01.080
at home I would actually get a chance to play In the Groove 2 while I was gone. Sorry kids

32:01.080 --> 32:05.000
that didn't happen. There were so many people at this tournament. And the way that 8 on

32:05.000 --> 32:11.920
on the break is kind of set up. It's really hard to get kind of close to the machine when

32:11.920 --> 32:15.000
there's all those people in there because the area... It's kind of like when they have

32:15.000 --> 32:18.920
tournaments at Sunnyvale Golfland, to put it in perspective for you guys. Like there's

32:18.920 --> 32:23.060
aisles in between the machines. They didn't really have... And that kind of surprised

32:23.060 --> 32:26.320
me because I kind of thought, well, they have this area with the pool tables. Why don't

32:26.320 --> 32:30.120
they take the machine and move it into the back area where there's all this extra room

32:30.120 --> 32:34.820
and move the pool tables around? But for whatever reason, they didn't do that. So I got to

32:34.820 --> 32:38.860
see in the Groove 2, but I didn't get to play it. And when I saw it, I was just kind of

32:38.860 --> 32:43.260
like, well, it's basically in the Groove 1 with different music and a red interface.

32:43.260 --> 32:48.980
That's pretty much, I was like, okay, whatever, I don't really get a huge deal. But in a way,

32:48.980 --> 32:52.900
that's also the exact same thing you could say about Max 2 versus Max, is that it was

32:52.900 --> 32:56.420
just, you know, more songs and a red interface. So I'm not going to fault the game for that.

32:56.420 --> 32:59.380
But I can't really give you a full review of the game until I actually play it. So I

32:59.380 --> 33:03.660
will withhold judgment of In the Groove 2 for a little while. But I didn't get a chance

33:03.660 --> 33:06.700
to play. But I will say this, this is what I thought was interesting about the DDR tournament

33:06.700 --> 33:10.940
on the East Coast. I didn't know anybody there except a couple people, and I'll get into

33:10.940 --> 33:14.380
that in a minute. I didn't know like anybody there, so it was really weird for me because

33:14.380 --> 33:17.740
usually when I go to DDR tournaments on the West Coast, I've been doing this for so long

33:17.740 --> 33:21.060
that I recognize a lot of the people there, and you know, it's kind of cool, but it was

33:21.060 --> 33:23.500
really weird going to the East Coast because nobody knew who I was, I didn't know who anybody

33:23.500 --> 33:28.500
was. And I was kind of like, I was kind of tired because I had a lot going on from the

33:28.500 --> 33:31.260
night before and stuff, just you know, work and everything, so I didn't really feel like

33:31.260 --> 33:34.920
being a social butterfly so it's just kind of lurking and you know what I

33:34.920 --> 33:37.340
think is interesting about DDR tournaments on the East Coast just like

33:37.340 --> 33:41.180
ones on the West Coast is that once again there is that guy at the

33:41.180 --> 33:45.720
tournament who really needs to learn about showering regularly and using

33:45.720 --> 33:48.860
deodorant but you don't know who the offender is because there's so many

33:48.860 --> 33:55.500
sweaty guys packed in a room together and you're like ah so that that doesn't

33:55.500 --> 33:58.580
change West Coast to East Coast sorry I don't know what to tell you guys that

33:58.580 --> 34:00.540
That doesn't change.

34:00.540 --> 34:03.120
But otherwise, in all seriousness, I stayed at the tournament.

34:03.120 --> 34:04.340
It looked like it was okay.

34:04.340 --> 34:06.580
It looked like it was being pretty efficiently managed.

34:06.580 --> 34:09.340
But in all honesty, I didn't end up staying much more than 20 minutes.

34:09.340 --> 34:14.540
Like I mentioned, since you didn't get a chance to play In the Groove 2 at 8 on the break,

34:14.540 --> 34:20.180
In the Groove 2 is actually at our local golf place, Paradise Island.

34:20.180 --> 34:21.180
It just came in.

34:21.180 --> 34:22.300
Did it officially get there?

34:22.300 --> 34:23.300
Officially got there.

34:23.300 --> 34:24.300
Interesting.

34:24.300 --> 34:25.300
I might have to go check that out.

34:25.300 --> 34:32.300
I have one more thing I forgot to say. Speaking of tournaments and arcades, Shaft 2 is happening.

34:32.300 --> 34:41.100
I've got dates in mind, possible sponsorship from Gamestop. So in mid-November we're having

34:41.100 --> 34:46.300
Shaft 2. Right on. Right on. And that will be, we'll definitely be a big sponsor of that

34:46.300 --> 34:51.540
tournament, of course, and we'll be whoring that tournament out, and that will be sometime

34:51.540 --> 34:55.060
in november is all we can say right now yes and working out and hopefully being

34:55.060 --> 34:57.220
able to broadcast live

34:57.220 --> 35:01.140
basically shaft 2 is going to be uh... ddr tournament and bowling league

35:01.140 --> 35:03.420
tournament

35:03.420 --> 35:06.820
how's that going to work because there's no

35:06.820 --> 35:10.660
well it is at a bowling alley so there are bowling lanes oh yes get it

35:10.660 --> 35:14.660
it's at fireside lanes oh i didn't realize it was at bowling okay well that works

35:14.660 --> 35:18.500
i mean obviously how are they going to do bowling in like a golf place

35:18.500 --> 35:21.440
You know, actually we were going to do the tournament at Roseville Golf Land and we were

35:21.440 --> 35:25.880
going to tie ten children down and roll a giant ball at them like you used to see on

35:25.880 --> 35:29.240
Roll a katamari at them so that they stay stuck.

35:29.240 --> 35:33.880
What was that old show they used to play on like USA which was like, you know, American

35:33.880 --> 35:34.880
Gladiators?

35:34.880 --> 35:38.800
Extreme Games with the Stars or whatever where they had the giant bowling ball and they'd

35:38.800 --> 35:41.100
knock over all the people in the bowling pins.

35:41.100 --> 35:44.200
That's what we were going to do with children.

35:44.200 --> 35:46.120
No it is actually going to be the legit bowling alley.

35:46.120 --> 35:48.120
And what will it be? DDR Extreme?

35:48.120 --> 35:50.120
Yes, it's on an Extreme machine.

35:50.120 --> 35:51.120
Alright.

35:51.120 --> 35:53.120
So I'm working out details and I just gotta get people together.

35:53.120 --> 35:54.120
Alright.

35:54.120 --> 35:59.120
We should see if there's room to do some type of TV thing and bring in a home version of something.

35:59.120 --> 36:02.120
Have like a... I wanna have like an Amplitude tournament.

36:02.120 --> 36:04.120
We'll see. We'll see what works out.

36:04.120 --> 36:05.120
Alright. That'd be fun.

36:05.120 --> 36:11.120
But, you know, I'm not gonna have much time to work on it at the end of the month because of course I'm doing that whole getting married thing, so...

36:11.120 --> 36:15.120
Well I will help you out and of course I'm sure Loki will too. I just volunteered you.

36:15.120 --> 36:18.560
a crappy dance game tournament have an emcee

36:18.560 --> 36:19.800
madcap emcee

36:19.800 --> 36:22.760
we should have the world's only emcee

36:22.760 --> 36:26.440
groove dance craze tournament

36:26.440 --> 36:29.800
have it like good attack it because it's so bad or something

36:29.800 --> 36:32.880
I do want to have a good attack tournament

36:32.880 --> 36:34.280
we did that like it

36:34.280 --> 36:37.280
or no it wasn't a good attack what was it that we did a miss attack

36:37.280 --> 36:39.680
it was a miss attack tournament

36:39.680 --> 36:41.440
what does Shaft stand for again?

36:41.440 --> 36:45.880
uh... second as back to money which is going to be found that act

36:45.880 --> 36:47.400
that money has to know that

36:47.400 --> 36:51.000
uh... fabulous turn it back to the front of the old another

36:51.000 --> 36:55.440
it came from so it'll be sacramento host another fucking tournament basically

36:55.440 --> 36:57.400
that for the sake of uh...

36:57.400 --> 37:00.820
the lovely management at fireside lanes it's fabulous

37:00.820 --> 37:01.880
uh... sorry

37:01.880 --> 37:03.780
and it's always fabulous

37:03.780 --> 37:07.440
about frickin got me in charge of the whole thing about sacramento host

37:07.440 --> 37:09.400
another fireside tournament

37:09.400 --> 37:11.400
Because we haven't done one before.

37:11.400 --> 37:13.400
That doesn't work.

37:13.400 --> 37:15.400
Host an awesome fireside tournament.

37:15.400 --> 37:16.400
Alright.

37:16.400 --> 37:21.400
I will see what I can do about buttering, because the chat room seems to be liking this idea of an amplitude tournament.

37:21.400 --> 37:29.400
So I will see what I can do about buttering up the One and Only Dark Sakura to let us do not only an amplitude tournament, but some really horrible video game tournament.

37:29.400 --> 37:31.400
I also may be coming into a copy of Rez.

37:31.400 --> 37:33.400
Oh cool.

37:33.400 --> 37:34.400
So maybe Rez tournament.

37:34.400 --> 37:36.400
Or something. Can you really do a tournament on Rez?

37:36.400 --> 37:37.400
Could try.

37:37.400 --> 37:42.400
I will be hosting an unofficial Meteos tournament, so bring your DS. It's on.

37:42.400 --> 37:47.400
Unofficial Meteos tournament. Anyway, more details on that come November.

37:47.400 --> 37:52.400
Actually, no, we won't give you the details in November, or else you won't have time to plan.

37:52.400 --> 37:55.400
More details to come, like, soon. As soon as we have details.

37:55.400 --> 37:58.400
And we would love for people to come from all over to support this.

37:58.400 --> 38:02.400
Absolutely. Later than now. Yes, later than now. Anyway.

38:02.400 --> 38:04.400
People can crash in my playroom.

38:04.400 --> 38:08.040
Back to the East Coast tournament. I didn't finish my story on the East Coast tournament.

38:08.040 --> 38:09.040
Why?

38:09.040 --> 38:13.320
I actually, no, it's alright. I cut you off. You can cut me off. It's fine. It's because

38:13.320 --> 38:18.160
we love each other. Um, Dark Sakura has this look of disgust on her face.

38:18.160 --> 38:20.280
No. No, that's okay.

38:20.280 --> 38:25.400
Um, and I just saw Bush intent on change on my Yahoo, so I was like, uh, that was the

38:25.400 --> 38:26.400
look of disgust.

38:26.400 --> 38:27.400
You just saw Bush?

38:27.400 --> 38:30.760
Bush intent on change. Social Security turns 70.

38:30.760 --> 38:31.760
Hee hee!

38:31.760 --> 38:32.760
Butt head! Anyway.

38:32.760 --> 38:42.760
Anyway, yeah, okay, sorry, I've been gone for a couple of weeks, everything's funny.

38:42.760 --> 38:47.080
Oh yeah, the tournament, I only ended up staying at this tournament for like 20 minutes because

38:47.080 --> 38:53.720
I just, I wasn't competing and I was just kind of watching and observing and I didn't

38:53.720 --> 38:57.400
know who to root for because I didn't know any of these people and I felt really bad

38:57.400 --> 39:01.080
but also I just had other stuff going on so I just ended up leaving after like 20 minutes

39:01.080 --> 39:03.440
Except I left with one of our listeners.

39:03.440 --> 39:04.440
So that was the cool thing.

39:04.440 --> 39:09.660
One of our listeners, Ron Chan, actually showed up at the tournament, and we left.

39:09.660 --> 39:14.720
And we went to, with some of his other friends, we actually went to this girl's house who

39:14.720 --> 39:19.200
lives in Jersey, and I'm so sorry, I forgot her name, I'm so horrible with names, but

39:19.200 --> 39:23.040
she was very cool because she had us all over at her house, and we were all in her basement.

39:23.040 --> 39:26.400
And they have, like, the most ginormous television I've ever seen in the basement.

39:26.400 --> 39:28.920
Seriously, it was like an IMAX TV in her basement.

39:28.920 --> 39:29.920
It was crazy.

39:29.920 --> 39:34.320
And so, of course, we were all excited because we were going to play DDR on, like, the IMAX

39:34.320 --> 39:38.360
TV, as I'm calling it, because it's a fucking huge TV.

39:38.360 --> 39:42.080
And then, lo and behold, our PlayStation 2 wouldn't load anything.

39:42.080 --> 39:49.480
We finally got DDR Extreme USA to work after a little bit, but no background movies, and

39:49.480 --> 39:51.800
you had to wait, like, two minutes for the song to load.

39:51.800 --> 39:53.960
That poor thing was busted.

39:53.960 --> 39:56.760
I didn't even get a chance to play because the damn thing broke before, but it's all

39:56.760 --> 39:57.760
right.

39:57.760 --> 39:58.760
I had fun.

39:58.760 --> 39:59.760
I had fun just being around strangers.

39:59.760 --> 40:06.600
my disk drive. That's why I use my hard drive. You know what I find ironic is all these people

40:06.600 --> 40:12.800
complain about their disk drive not working and it going off the thing. I have a first

40:12.800 --> 40:19.520
model JPS2 that's never had a problem. And on top of that the whole reason that the component

40:19.520 --> 40:23.480
cable didn't work when we were trying to play Katamari at my house was because we didn't

40:23.480 --> 40:27.860
have the visual setting set up for component. Oh yeah, I found that out too the first time

40:27.860 --> 40:33.220
I tried to do component is that it wasn't set up right. Anyway, anyway, so yeah, we

40:33.220 --> 40:37.200
were playing extreme for a little bit and then we just kind of just hung out, went to

40:37.200 --> 40:40.460
a diner and ate and then left, went our several ways. And I went back to the tournament because

40:40.460 --> 40:43.660
I thought, okay, the tournament should be over by now and I'll have a chance to play

40:43.660 --> 40:49.420
in the groove too. So I can finally, you know, let Loki know how great it is. And lo and

40:49.420 --> 40:52.780
behold, when I got back, the tournament was still going on and it looked like it was still

40:52.780 --> 40:57.480
perfect attack. I think actually what I missed in the morning, they were doing like an exhibition.

40:57.480 --> 41:02.200
they were setting up for freestyle, but I missed the actual competition itself.

41:02.200 --> 41:07.280
And it still smelled like armpit when I got back, sorry to say.

41:07.280 --> 41:10.520
But again, I'm not trying to pick on East Coast, because it's the same thing on the

41:10.520 --> 41:11.520
West Coast.

41:11.520 --> 41:15.800
I'm not trying to make a Jersey reference, are you?

41:15.800 --> 41:17.800
Shut up!

41:17.800 --> 41:21.400
Well you know why they built the Statue of Liberty facing the way it does?

41:21.400 --> 41:23.200
It's ass-facing New Jersey.

41:23.200 --> 41:28.520
No, actually, everybody bashes on New Jersey, but I rather liked it in New Jersey.

41:28.520 --> 41:30.400
I thought New Jersey was a nice place.

41:30.400 --> 41:35.320
I like New Jersey because that's where Jay and Silent Bob and Kevin Smith and all...

41:35.320 --> 41:39.400
I went to Red Bank my last trip to Jersey, so this time I just kind of hung out in Dun

41:39.400 --> 41:41.000
Ellen a little while longer.

41:41.000 --> 41:42.520
I actually kind of like Jersey.

41:42.520 --> 41:43.920
I don't know why people knock on it.

41:43.920 --> 41:48.280
But from what I understand about Jersey, it's the big cities that suck.

41:48.280 --> 41:53.040
Like Jersey City and, you know, the other big cities in New Jersey that are no fun.

41:53.040 --> 41:55.120
I had a good time.

41:55.120 --> 41:56.800
But you know what else?

41:56.800 --> 41:59.000
I actually went into New York City on Saturday and just

41:59.000 --> 42:01.160
walked around aimlessly for forever.

42:01.160 --> 42:05.200
We just walked around the Chelsea district, wink, wink.

42:05.200 --> 42:09.200
We walked around the area around Grand Central Station.

42:09.200 --> 42:11.200
We walked around Union Square.

42:11.200 --> 42:12.360
We walked around Times Square.

42:12.360 --> 42:14.320
We just walked forever and ever.

42:14.320 --> 42:15.880
Didn't get a chance to play any DDR in New York City.

42:15.880 --> 42:17.600
But I loved New York City.

42:17.600 --> 42:18.480
I had a great time.

42:18.480 --> 42:23.000
And I'm totally thinking like, I should just move here.

42:23.000 --> 42:26.760
But I know I won't. That's just the afterglow of a trip, you know?

42:26.760 --> 42:30.120
I've been once and have not been inclined to go back for a long time.

42:30.120 --> 42:33.480
This was 11 years ago.

42:33.480 --> 42:37.400
The first time I went I was 17. But everything was too organized.

42:37.400 --> 42:40.600
It was nice to go back and not have a plan and get to walk around just like everywhere.

42:40.600 --> 42:43.880
It was great. I had a really good time. I think I'd have a better time.

42:43.880 --> 42:47.640
But honestly, I don't like looking up and seeing building.

42:47.640 --> 42:50.840
I like looking up and seeing a tree and sky

42:50.840 --> 42:53.320
and breathing air that's not full of dirt.

42:53.320 --> 42:54.320
It didn't bother me.

42:54.320 --> 42:55.320
It didn't bother me.

42:55.320 --> 42:56.320
But this is the weird thing.

42:56.320 --> 42:59.380
I hate San Francisco for that exact reason you're mentioning.

42:59.380 --> 43:01.160
New York City, I loved.

43:01.160 --> 43:02.160
I don't know why.

43:02.160 --> 43:03.160
I think it's...

43:03.160 --> 43:04.160
Well, no, no, no.

43:04.160 --> 43:05.160
I do know why, actually.

43:05.160 --> 43:06.160
It was the people.

43:06.160 --> 43:08.320
There was a lot of just neat-looking people and neat-looking things.

43:08.320 --> 43:13.480
I went to the Toys R Us in Times Square, which was awesome.

43:13.480 --> 43:14.480
The Toys R Us in Times Square.

43:14.480 --> 43:16.920
I've never been to such a cool-looking Toys R Us.

43:16.920 --> 43:18.480
Did you eat at Ruxy?

43:18.480 --> 43:19.480
No.

43:19.480 --> 43:20.480
That place is awesome.

43:20.480 --> 43:23.680
We walked around for forever and ended up eating at some diner called like moon

43:24.200 --> 43:27.040
Moon struck because I remember making a joke about the Cher movie

43:27.040 --> 43:29.380
It was a diner called moon struck that we ate at but anyway

43:29.920 --> 43:33.080
We went to Times Square Toys R Us huge

43:33.080 --> 43:36.800
There's like a ferris wheel inside the place, but in the basement is like the game area

43:37.160 --> 43:38.340
It was so cool

43:38.340 --> 43:43.380
Like they had demos for all these upcoming games was almost like going to e3 like they have the Nintendogs demo

43:43.380 --> 43:48.680
They had a bunch of other demos and it was I didn't realize the Nintendogs demo was like everywhere at this point in a lot

43:48.680 --> 43:52.200
of stores because I saw it at Best Buy the other day, but I just, I loved the setup there

43:52.200 --> 43:56.720
and it was not an overpriced Toys R Us. You would think that the Times Square would have

43:56.720 --> 44:00.400
overpriced games, but it was pretty much the same thing they'd charge in any, you know,

44:00.400 --> 44:03.880
mall or anything. So I had a really good time. I do want to go back and spend more time in

44:03.880 --> 44:08.240
the city. Moving there, I think that's just kind of a joke. I don't think I would actually

44:08.240 --> 44:09.240
be...

44:09.240 --> 44:10.680
That would be highly unrealistic because it's...

44:10.680 --> 44:18.560
It's expensive to live there. So we'll see. Anyway. Do do do do do. So I guess that's about

44:18.560 --> 44:23.500
it. You know what? You know what's funny? Somebody in our chat room, Sephiroth1215 actually

44:23.500 --> 44:28.340
said, brought up the Chinatown in the Groove 2 machine. I found out about that after I

44:28.340 --> 44:32.940
left New York City because Bronma, DJronmaS told me about it, was showing me pictures

44:32.940 --> 44:37.280
of the machine, and I'm kind of sad. I could have gone to Chinatown and actually played

44:37.280 --> 44:42.260
in the Groove 2, but my friend who I was with doesn't really get the whole DDR thing. Like,

44:42.260 --> 44:46.080
she likes games and all, but she doesn't get my obsession with DDR, so I don't think she

44:46.080 --> 44:50.360
she would have gone for it. Let's go all the way to Chinatown to play a funny dancy game.

44:50.360 --> 44:54.400
She wouldn't have gone for it. Love her to death, but we just have different interests

44:54.400 --> 44:58.520
in that regard. So anyway, that's me. That's my big bloated story about my week and my

44:58.520 --> 45:02.320
weekend. But the tournament, it seemed like there was a lot of good people and I swear

45:02.320 --> 45:06.080
if I go back, I will be more friendly next time in the next tournament. I will wear this

45:06.080 --> 45:10.960
big shirt for Orange Lounge Radio or something so that people might connect me with it or

45:10.960 --> 45:15.000
something. Just like, caution Dr. Dick. Or yeah, I should just go on Dr. Dick garb or

45:15.000 --> 45:18.120
something but seriously this time I dress I just blend it in I was just

45:18.120 --> 45:21.520
not a kid at the thing although really probably I'm probably the oldest person

45:21.520 --> 45:27.680
that was there but um you know I swear next time I go all all but I I have

45:27.680 --> 45:30.840
some time off around the Labor Day but there's too much going on around that

45:30.840 --> 45:35.280
time where I might not be able to go so we'll see yeah cuz someone you know is

45:35.280 --> 45:38.840
getting married I do but I need to find out when the reception is because I can

45:38.840 --> 45:46.760
playing around it the next weekend all right anyway let's go to a break now

45:46.760 --> 45:50.680
now see everybody on the East Coast is as telling me all these machines all

45:50.680 --> 45:54.520
these in the groove two machines I could have gone to play thanks guys this is

45:54.520 --> 45:57.240
good to find out about after the fact now somebody's saying you should go to

45:57.240 --> 46:04.280
Coney Island all right let's go to a break in this break we're gonna hear

46:04.280 --> 46:07.800
some requests from the chat room and when we come back we're gonna talk about

46:07.800 --> 46:14.800
We're gonna talk about DDR with Fire, and we're gonna talk about some other things that have been going on in the DDR scene, and we'll talk about whatever else we feel like talking about.

46:14.800 --> 46:20.800
We'll be back after this. We're gonna start it off with a request. We actually had a couple In the Groove song requests, so we'll get those out of the way.

46:20.800 --> 46:24.800
Oh, this is good too because we want to hear about Loki's experience with In the Groove.

46:24.800 --> 46:29.800
Because you teased something a while back. What did you tease the listeners with? That you were going to rent it or that you rented it but hadn't played it?

46:29.800 --> 46:37.800
I have it, and I've played it, and I was going to tell you my thoughts on it, and we're going to see if they've changed.

46:37.800 --> 46:39.800
Okay, that's the first thing I've ever read.

46:39.800 --> 46:43.800
Because it's very possible that they might have changed, and I could be an in-the-group lover.

46:43.800 --> 46:46.800
And then again, Angels could be real also, but...

46:46.800 --> 46:52.800
You know what, though? Now, you posted in your Live Turtle something this week about an Apple product, and that you liked it.

46:52.800 --> 46:55.800
The G6 or something, right? Wasn't it? Or something?

46:55.800 --> 47:01.480
It was the netBSP Linux toaster. It was the Linux toaster.

47:01.480 --> 47:07.080
I was on dial-up. I couldn't follow links. So, wait. There was something Apple related.

47:07.080 --> 47:10.600
You confessed to liking a lot. There was two. There was two things I posted

47:10.600 --> 47:13.400
in my Live Year Old. There's one that said this, that they're only

47:13.400 --> 47:16.880
viable use for an Apple iPod. And it was a story about a woman bludgeoning

47:16.880 --> 47:19.180
her boyfriend. Which was fake.

47:19.180 --> 47:21.400
With an iPod. Okay. And then... If you look, it was on the rumor

47:21.400 --> 47:28.400
And then the second one was a picture of the Apple G6 and it was the Linux toaster.

47:28.400 --> 47:33.400
Because we all know that the Apple has the processing power of a toaster.

47:33.400 --> 47:34.400
I hate you.

47:34.400 --> 47:37.400
I was bored that day, okay?

47:37.400 --> 47:39.400
We'll be back with Loki's thoughts on a degree.

47:39.400 --> 47:43.400
Honestly, I am sick and tired of the stupid Apple thing.

47:43.400 --> 47:45.400
Okay, granted, we know that I don't like them.

47:45.400 --> 47:48.400
Do we really need to constantly bring this up that I don't like them?

47:48.400 --> 47:50.400
Because it gets old.

47:50.400 --> 47:57.400
nope doesn't get old

48:20.400 --> 48:22.400
I'm calling you

48:28.400 --> 48:31.400
Shadows have been fed by

48:31.400 --> 48:35.400
The red and tattered and I

48:35.400 --> 48:37.400
Will love you

48:38.400 --> 48:40.400
Forever

48:42.400 --> 48:46.400
I'm telling you now but why

48:46.400 --> 48:49.400
I'm taking so long to die

48:49.400 --> 48:51.400
I miss you

48:53.400 --> 48:55.400
Forever

48:55.400 --> 48:57.400
Here on me

48:57.400 --> 48:59.400
Clean up life

48:59.400 --> 49:01.400
Walk me through the night

49:01.400 --> 49:03.400
And deep inside

49:03.400 --> 49:05.400
The ceiling are hurting

49:05.400 --> 49:07.400
Clean up life

49:07.400 --> 49:09.400
Tell me why

49:09.400 --> 49:11.400
If you hide

49:11.400 --> 49:13.400
Down behind the curtain

49:13.400 --> 49:17.400
High, high, high, high, high, high, high, high, high

49:17.400 --> 49:24.400
Can you see me falling high, high, high, high, high, high, high, high

49:24.400 --> 49:27.600
Can you hear me calling you?

50:24.400 --> 50:26.400
I'm the recognition

50:27.400 --> 50:29.400
I'm falling in love

50:29.400 --> 50:31.400
I'm falling in love

50:31.400 --> 50:33.400
Let's take it from the top, keep moving, moving

50:33.400 --> 50:35.400
The beat is real swift, it's grooving

50:35.400 --> 50:37.400
Rob is here, put it in gear, lean your head

50:37.400 --> 50:39.400
Cause the beat is real funky, tread

50:39.400 --> 50:40.400
Let's rock and roll with soul

50:40.400 --> 50:41.400
I hold the mic and go

50:41.400 --> 50:42.400
Cause Rob is in full control

50:42.400 --> 50:44.400
Mainstaying the game the same

50:44.400 --> 50:46.400
And what I see for rhyme for rhyme will now be blank

50:46.400 --> 50:48.400
I'm the recognition

50:49.400 --> 50:51.400
I'm falling in love

51:21.400 --> 51:25.400
Don't stop the pain

52:51.400 --> 53:18.760
I'll do it all night, do it with me I'll do it all night, do it with me

53:18.760 --> 53:23.760
Do it with me, I'll take you to heaven if you make me feel free, babe

53:23.760 --> 53:26.760
Do it tonight, do it alright

53:26.760 --> 53:31.760
Just take me and shake me till I burn up inside, no

53:31.760 --> 53:49.240
You may have complex and some incredible tricks and maxes

53:49.240 --> 53:52.480
You may be the slave of Tim and Tom and Ed and Dave

53:52.480 --> 53:55.800
You may do it again with handsome friends and check and care

53:55.800 --> 53:59.160
But you're gonna feel so free when you do it in the name

53:59.160 --> 54:06.160
Do it all night, do it with me, I'll take you to heaven if you make me feel free, baby

54:06.160 --> 54:13.160
Do it tonight, do it alright, just take me and shake me till I burn up inside, oh

54:13.160 --> 54:19.160
Do it all night, do it with me, hard as a fire with a straw and a tree

54:19.160 --> 54:26.160
Do it tonight, do it alright You got it, I knew it, you can do it tonight

54:34.160 --> 54:37.160
You're the home of the fire, the straw in the tree

54:37.160 --> 54:51.720
Come on, do it with me.

54:51.720 --> 54:57.080
Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song, Orange Lounge Radio.

54:57.080 --> 54:59.560
Well, back boys and girls, here on Orange Lounge Radio.

54:59.560 --> 55:03.120
On that break, you heard some varying music there that was either inspired by

55:03.120 --> 55:07.720
by chat or requested outright by chat. Queen of Light there from In the Groove, a minute

55:07.720 --> 55:14.320
from DDR Max 2. And I know that Rini who requested that song actually wanted to hear the original

55:14.320 --> 55:18.400
like old ass version. It only takes a minute. But I couldn't find it. I could have sworn

55:18.400 --> 55:22.040
it was in that giant potpourri directory that I got from your computer, which I think in

55:22.040 --> 55:25.560
turn came from Iguana Girl's computer. I don't know why that would have been in there since

55:25.560 --> 55:31.560
that's the original. I don't know. Wasn't there one in like way old ass DDR? No. I thought

55:31.560 --> 55:34.560
The original was never in DDR.

55:34.560 --> 55:37.560
I thought it was. I thought it was in like an old-ass mix of DDR.

55:37.560 --> 55:38.560
No, never.

55:38.560 --> 55:40.560
Sorry, my memory's fading as I'm getting old.

55:40.560 --> 55:42.560
Summer in Belize from In the Groove 2.

55:42.560 --> 55:45.560
That was actually the first time I really listened to that song.

55:45.560 --> 55:47.560
Not Too Shabby, I liked that one. That was pretty cool.

55:47.560 --> 55:51.560
Erotic from DDR3rd makes do it all night because the chat room was talking about Erotic.

55:51.560 --> 55:54.560
Somebody actually asked what the Dr. Dick thing was all about,

55:54.560 --> 56:00.560
and even though I couldn't really play this song because it's a little bit longer,

56:00.560 --> 56:09.520
It was actually kind of inspired by an old erotic song called Help Me Dr. Dick, is where

56:09.520 --> 56:11.800
that monkey comes from, the Dr. Dick name.

56:11.800 --> 56:24.680
And it's my improv freestyle alter ego, let me play a little clip of the song.

56:24.680 --> 56:30.040
There we go, so that's the song from Erotic and that's where it came from.

56:30.040 --> 56:35.080
Anyway, the chat room is swearing up and down that that was in third mix. Let me check my

56:35.080 --> 56:40.840
DDR in a minute. I could swear that... I thought I'd played the original one in DDR before,

56:40.840 --> 56:44.320
it's just been so long, and it's not, to be honest kids, it's not really one of my favorite

56:44.320 --> 56:48.440
songs. I'll just check, step mania doesn't count, I'll check my home version. Holy crap,

56:48.440 --> 56:54.440
here it is, wait, I have the third mix soundtrack. You got it? Here it is. That's right, that's

56:54.440 --> 57:04.440
I have to think of this, because I was singing of a different one by them.

57:04.440 --> 57:07.440
It's one of those ones I just never freaking played because I didn't like the song. Sorry

57:07.440 --> 57:11.440
kids. I love this song. I didn't like it. Sorry kids. It's one of those ones I always

57:11.440 --> 57:17.960
skipped. Alright, so we fucked up. Leave us alone. We're allowed to make a mistake once

57:17.960 --> 57:23.800
in a while. Alright, anyway, let's take a minute. We're going to have Loki's review

57:23.800 --> 57:28.880
you now of In The Groove? Loki, you were mentioning that you, did you rent or you bought In The

57:28.880 --> 57:36.520
Groove? Or you acquired In The Groove? I, let me just say I played In The Groove, how

57:36.520 --> 57:42.520
about that? We'll leave it at that. Okay. Because I consider it a waste of space, I'm

57:42.520 --> 57:47.400
gonna, you know, use it as a waste, basically say it's a waste of space on my hard drive.

57:47.400 --> 57:54.400
But anyways, um, so yes, I played it in the groove, I booted it up, tried it, you know,

57:54.400 --> 57:58.800
said, okay, what's the big deal about this game, played it for a good, you know, a good

57:58.800 --> 57:59.800
half an hour.

57:59.800 --> 58:03.660
I definitely gave a couple songs a try.

58:03.660 --> 58:06.500
My opinion of this game has not changed one bit.

58:06.500 --> 58:07.760
It still sucks ass.

58:07.760 --> 58:10.620
And now I have played it, I can say it sucks ass.

58:10.620 --> 58:14.060
You know, and I'm still debating on buying an actual copy of the game so I can write

58:14.060 --> 58:20.940
this game sucks ass so we can give it away. But I have, you know, I've thought about it,

58:20.940 --> 58:25.180
I have thought about it and, you know, right now, $45 could be better spent somewhere else.

58:25.180 --> 58:30.700
So I'm going to wait for the game to go to the bargain bin. It's just, it's, you know,

58:30.700 --> 58:35.700
I, I played the game. I, I played it for a while. You know, I unlocked a couple songs.

58:35.700 --> 58:39.020
What kind of songs did you play when you played it? Did you, were there any catchy songs you

58:39.020 --> 58:43.620
liked at all? I honestly, I can't even, they're forgettable. That's how, that's how bad this

58:43.620 --> 58:48.380
game is. I played a few things. I was just kind of going down the list. And I don't remember

58:48.380 --> 58:52.460
what songs I played when I played them. But the step charts to me seemed like something

58:52.460 --> 58:56.780
I saw like on Bomani's style in their sim file section. Like some idiot, just any idiot

58:56.780 --> 59:01.380
made them up. They weren't that great. I mean, and I was playing on the most difficult settings

59:01.380 --> 59:07.100
so I was just, you know, okay, expecting something really cool. No. I never got it. And okay,

59:07.100 --> 59:12.100
wow, there's so many modifiers. Does nothing for me. You know, that's just like saying,

59:12.100 --> 59:15.620
oh look you know cereal comes in multiple colors doesn't matter to me I

59:15.620 --> 59:15.940
mean

59:15.940 --> 59:19.900
okay to play devil's advocate here a little bit okay what's so freaking great

59:19.900 --> 59:21.340
about the our home releases then

59:21.340 --> 59:25.260
what's so great about the the music for one all their music in in the group

59:25.260 --> 59:28.160
sounded like some just

59:28.160 --> 59:31.860
amateurs a very very amateur no sounding music

59:31.860 --> 59:34.900
I'm granted license stuff with okay

59:34.900 --> 59:37.940
I mean it was okay but it wasn't stand out it was just

59:37.940 --> 59:41.060
I mean it's forgettable the entire game is forgettable

59:41.060 --> 59:43.620
That's pretty much what it comes down to.

59:43.620 --> 59:48.540
I mean, you'd think that I'd be, you know, ranting and raving about this game, but even

59:48.540 --> 59:50.900
the unlocked songs were just whoopity-doo.

59:50.900 --> 59:52.780
I mean, it wasn't that great.

59:52.780 --> 59:56.540
And I saw the preview songs for In the Groove 2 on there.

59:56.540 --> 59:57.540
Wow.

59:57.540 --> 01:00:01.700
I'm glad to say that they've sure not stepped up.

01:00:01.700 --> 01:00:04.140
You know, it's interesting you didn't even like the unlocks, because I would say probably

01:00:04.140 --> 01:00:08.860
my favorite In the Groove song with, I think, some of the most fun steps is one of the unlocks,

01:00:08.860 --> 01:00:09.860
Anubis.

01:00:09.860 --> 01:00:17.860
I know that song's horrid, sorry guys, but I think it's like the most fun with steps.

01:00:17.860 --> 01:00:21.060
It's right up there with some of the great DDR songs, in my opinion, just the way the

01:00:21.060 --> 01:00:23.500
steps are designed to go with the song.

01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:26.100
It's so much fun to dance to, I think, that particular song.

01:00:26.100 --> 01:00:29.780
But remember, I don't hate In the Groove with a Passion like you do.

01:00:29.780 --> 01:00:31.660
You know, I was trying to give it a fair shot.

01:00:31.660 --> 01:00:36.140
I was going into it and saying, okay, I've knocked on this game enough, let me see what

01:00:36.140 --> 01:00:38.820
it is, because maybe I could be wrong about it.

01:00:38.820 --> 01:00:44.340
I'm afraid I was not wrong about it. It's just, it sucks. It's a crappy game. It's what

01:00:44.340 --> 01:00:48.300
it comes down to. I mean, it's another music game. Granted, if you're really starving for

01:00:48.300 --> 01:00:54.180
music games, go play it. But I'm not starving for music games, so I'm not gonna play it.

01:00:54.180 --> 01:00:58.940
That's what it's gonna come down to. And I just didn't like it. To me, the whole game

01:00:58.940 --> 01:01:04.500
seemed like, you know, it seemed very, very amateur. It seemed like just some guy made

01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:10.300
some homebrew stuff, got some company to publish it for them, and boom! There's the game. Well,

01:01:10.300 --> 01:01:11.700
that's pretty much what happened anyway.

01:01:11.700 --> 01:01:13.860
I was going to say, that's kind of what happened anyway, but...

01:01:13.860 --> 01:01:18.940
But there's just not the polish in there. It's just that, and even In the Groove 2,

01:01:18.940 --> 01:01:19.940
there's not...

01:01:19.940 --> 01:01:23.180
You're not going to give them a break on the polish thing, considering it's their first

01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:28.780
mix they've ever done, Red Octane's first game they've published, Roxor's only important

01:01:28.780 --> 01:01:32.060
game they've ever done, et cetera, et cetera? You're not going to give them a break?

01:01:32.060 --> 01:01:35.220
I'm even talking about In the Groove 2. No polish on this game.

01:01:35.220 --> 01:01:38.820
It's like, wow, we changed the air face to red. Whoop-a-dee-doo!

01:01:38.820 --> 01:01:41.300
Okay, you can change it to green, it releases it to green.

01:01:41.300 --> 01:01:43.060
There's a little more they did to In the Groove 2.

01:01:43.060 --> 01:01:47.540
And like I said, honestly, at first they added ugly characters, I'm sorry.

01:01:47.540 --> 01:01:52.180
You know what, as much as I'm trying to play devil's advocate for In the Groove here,

01:01:52.180 --> 01:01:53.660
because I do think the game's alright,

01:01:53.660 --> 01:01:56.740
the characters thing is kinda, yeah, lame.

01:01:56.740 --> 01:02:01.340
But In the Groove 2 and In the Groove 1

01:02:01.340 --> 01:02:05.480
really feels to me, just from observer, remember I haven't played the game yet so I'm not going

01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:08.980
to give a full review on the game until I actually play it, but from a glance, from

01:02:08.980 --> 01:02:13.500
looking at it, it doesn't look any different from Max 2 to Max 1. And let's not forget

01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:16.520
Max 2 was actually a real improvement over Max 1. But what did they do? They changed

01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:20.020
the interface to Reb. Whoopee shit! And added some songs. But the game itself was...

01:02:20.020 --> 01:02:24.300
Well they also added non-stops and stuff, I think. Or Oni. Wasn't Oni in the...

01:02:24.300 --> 01:02:25.700
Well, marathons and in the groove.

01:02:25.700 --> 01:02:35.700
Well, they have that on their show. I don't know. Whatever. But still, though, I mean, come on now. It's... I don't know. I even... It's just, it wasn't for me.

01:02:35.700 --> 01:02:41.700
Alright, boys and girls, if you disagree with Loki, we will give you a chance to, uh, present your opinion.

01:02:41.700 --> 01:02:53.700
Well, you know, so what? You disagree. Big deal. I mean, I gave it a shot. It wasn't like, you know, I'm talking about nothing here. I actually played the game. So, you know, what are you gonna say? Oh, so you don't like it. You're wrong. No, actually, it's my opinion, so I'm right.

01:02:53.700 --> 01:02:57.620
It's just, you know, it's just not a very good game.

01:02:57.620 --> 01:03:02.260
You know, whatever. I mean, I don't like pump it up either that much.

01:03:02.260 --> 01:03:05.620
Granted, that game is better than In the Groove because

01:03:05.620 --> 01:03:08.940
they've put more polish into the game. Granted, I think the crazy mode is

01:03:08.940 --> 01:03:09.900
retarded, but

01:03:09.900 --> 01:03:13.420
you know, the dance sequences are fun

01:03:13.420 --> 01:03:16.980
and the music is okay. It's different. And

01:03:16.980 --> 01:03:21.220
I don't know, the background movies are actually good, whereas In the Groove is kinda

01:03:21.220 --> 01:03:25.600
playing but you know I will actually go on the record saying and keep in mind I

01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:29.440
haven't played many pump it up games in the arcade I've played a very various

01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:35.560
amount I actually think in the grooves better than pump it up I hate pump it up

01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:40.280
interface with a passion I hate it it ruins almost the whole damn game for me

01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:43.120
to be honest the music is kind of hit and miss there's some great songs and

01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:48.100
pump it up but a few more misses than hits for me I can't play the same six

01:03:48.100 --> 01:03:52.100
I can play In The Groove a little bit longer, I guess, to see if my opinion changes.

01:03:52.100 --> 01:03:53.100
Well, your opinion won't change.

01:03:53.100 --> 01:03:57.100
Yeah. Maybe In The Groove 2 is this godly game.

01:03:57.100 --> 01:04:00.100
Yeah, there you go. Now maybe In The Groove 2 is a little better. You'll see. We'll see.

01:04:00.100 --> 01:04:01.100
All right.

01:04:01.100 --> 01:04:02.100
I don't think so.

01:04:02.100 --> 01:04:09.100
That's like saying maybe McDonald's, you know, brand new stuff is going to taste good. Maybe it's going to be real meat this time. No.

01:04:09.100 --> 01:04:15.100
All right. Well, chat room, if you want to respond to that, we will open up the Skype line a little later.

01:04:15.100 --> 01:04:19.220
later. If you want to... There's not going to be anything you're going to say that's

01:04:19.220 --> 01:04:22.940
going to change Loki's mind. I do have something though that we got to try. I meant to get

01:04:22.940 --> 01:04:29.860
here earlier today. Okay. I have acquired a copy of SingStar. What the hell's that?

01:04:29.860 --> 01:04:36.060
The European karaoke game. Oh. Oh! Oh, gosh. You brought this up like months ago on the

01:04:36.060 --> 01:04:40.300
show. Okay, I remember SingStar. Yeah, their karaoke game that's, you know... Was that

01:04:40.300 --> 01:04:47.180
the one in E3? It might have been. It's a karaoke game that, you know, it's not Konami

01:04:47.180 --> 01:04:53.340
made. Hold on. Dark Soccer, do you remember this E3 booth, the UK games? You probably

01:04:53.340 --> 01:04:57.700
spent a little time there, right? A little bit? Uh, sort of. They had a karaoke game.

01:04:57.700 --> 01:05:03.800
Sing Star? Is that the name of it? Yeah, what was it? Pop Star. Yeah, Sing Star Pop. So

01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:07.340
maybe they altered the name a little bit. Okay, so you got a chance to check this out?

01:05:07.340 --> 01:05:09.500
well i haven't got a play yet

01:05:09.500 --> 01:05:12.500
uh... but i've meant to bring it over today

01:05:12.500 --> 01:05:14.300
so i want to get out next week

01:05:14.300 --> 01:05:16.800
did you just like you're every type of attention for bs

01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:20.540
night i was wrapped or literally i'd like to require my option to be late

01:05:20.540 --> 01:05:23.180
alright alright

01:05:23.180 --> 01:05:26.940
speaking of technical taxes and i actually have to play a new game uh...

01:05:26.940 --> 01:05:30.420
a music game myself this past week it was actually came that they have on a

01:05:30.420 --> 01:05:31.140
different

01:05:31.140 --> 01:05:32.820
eight at eight on the break

01:05:32.820 --> 01:05:36.460
and actually something that the creators of the air to stick that is the

01:05:36.460 --> 01:05:39.580
distributors of the game actually emailed us about a while back and we've

01:05:39.580 --> 01:05:41.900
kind of refrained from talking about it because there has been a lot of

01:05:41.900 --> 01:05:45.940
information on it but I actually got a chance to play this game and imagine if

01:05:45.940 --> 01:05:52.140
Taiko no Tatujin and Drummania had a baby it would be this game called

01:05:52.140 --> 01:05:57.100
Percussion Master which is what I got a chance to play over at 8 on the break I

01:05:57.100 --> 01:06:00.940
actually kind of enjoyed Percussion Master when I first was kind of looking

01:06:00.940 --> 01:06:04.380
at the the release that the guy had sent us and stuff and the fact that there

01:06:04.380 --> 01:06:08.460
wasn't a whole lot of information. I was kind of thinking, eh, I don't know about this game.

01:06:08.460 --> 01:06:12.380
It kind of looks like it's going to be a little cheesy bit of a rip-off. But what makes this

01:06:12.380 --> 01:06:15.540
game good is that they actually have a pretty solid song list. Now, granted, they have a

01:06:15.540 --> 01:06:19.020
lot of covers in it, but that's okay, because Karaoke Revolution has covers, too, and they

01:06:19.020 --> 01:06:20.460
work out really well.

01:06:20.460 --> 01:06:26.060
Progression Master has covers of songs like Goonies Are Good Enough, Mickey, I think there

01:06:26.060 --> 01:06:29.060
was a Britney Spears song I had to play in there, too, and then just some other, like,

01:06:29.060 --> 01:06:32.420
classics as well. I don't remember the whole list. I'm sure there's a song list out there

01:06:32.420 --> 01:06:37.460
the internet somewhere. But I had a pretty solid song list. I was pretty impressed.

01:06:37.460 --> 01:06:42.500
And it was pretty fun to play. The drums were pretty solid. You basically have a giant drum

01:06:42.500 --> 01:06:49.140
in the middle and then two on the side. So it's kind of like an O and then one right

01:06:49.140 --> 01:06:52.220
above the upper left and upper right, like cymbals or something you could call it, although

01:06:52.220 --> 01:06:57.720
they don't look like it. They look like loaves of bread that you're hitting. So you're beating

01:06:57.720 --> 01:07:01.540
on a pie and two loaves of bread. That's the progression. But it feels a lot like taiko

01:07:01.540 --> 01:07:05.500
for some reason when you play, because it's like, instead of hitting the side of the drum,

01:07:05.500 --> 01:07:08.620
you're hitting these little things on the top, where normally it would be a very similar

01:07:08.620 --> 01:07:10.920
striking motion as I would hit the side of the drum.

01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:14.720
So that's why I think I kind of call it very similar to Taiko, but the interface is very

01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:17.760
much like Drummania, where the notes scroll from the top.

01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:19.560
And it was pretty cool.

01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:25.060
The only, I guess, negative thing I would be able to say about Percussion Master is

01:07:25.060 --> 01:07:31.080
that it doesn't seem like there's a whole lot you can do with the game.

01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:34.280
And granted, maybe you could say the same thing about Drummania, but it kind of seems

01:07:34.280 --> 01:07:37.920
like, I don't know, with these three drums, and maybe I didn't play songs that were hard

01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:42.120
enough, but it kind of seemed like, I think this game might get boring after a while.

01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:46.080
I didn't see anything in it that would really make me want to play it like an awful lot,

01:07:46.080 --> 01:07:49.960
like where I could get like into this game and have like the total replay value.

01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:54.480
But as far as like a nice little side distraction to have in your arcade next to other music

01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:55.480
games, I think it's a great addition.

01:07:55.480 --> 01:07:56.920
I think people should check it out at least once.

01:07:56.920 --> 01:08:01.920
I guess it's probably easier to play than MTV's Drumscape.

01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:03.920
There are no directions.

01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:07.920
That game is just crazy. You sort of have to guess as you go along.

01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:10.920
They have one in Santa Cruz on the boardwalk.

01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:11.920
Yeah, it's like, huh?

01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:14.920
I think it's distributed by the same people that do the Drumscape game.

01:08:14.920 --> 01:08:17.920
Because I remember on their site I thought I saw something about Drumscape.

01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:19.920
But this is not... I didn't see any ties to MTV.

01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:23.920
You know what was really kind of funky about this game is that on their high score list

01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:25.920
it actually had pictures of the high score people.

01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:28.940
game actually has a little teeny camera in it that takes your picture, like an itoy type

01:08:28.940 --> 01:08:32.680
thing that takes your picture when you get a high score. Now, I didn't get any high scores.

01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:38.840
Go figure, I freaking triple-a'd two of my songs the first time I ever played them. They're

01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:42.000
not really triple-a's, but whatever you want to call them. I got all perfects the first

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:45.520
time I played these songs, and I didn't get my picture on the high score board. I guess

01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:50.300
my scores weren't good enough somehow, even though I got all perfects. Oh well. Somebody

01:08:50.300 --> 01:08:53.180
beat me to it i don't know

01:08:53.180 --> 01:08:54.260
uh...

01:08:54.260 --> 01:08:58.420
yeah the answer the question chat is a cmt be like if i didn't see an mtv logo

01:08:58.420 --> 01:09:02.180
on this game anywhere and i don't think it's empty and there was nothing

01:09:02.180 --> 01:09:04.700
like carson daley wasn't in it

01:09:04.700 --> 01:09:07.700
i don't think there was anything to do with the dailies

01:09:07.700 --> 01:09:10.580
but he's not going to be anymore really i don't think so

01:09:10.580 --> 01:09:13.780
i think he's gone i think it works for nbc now that's right

01:09:13.780 --> 01:09:16.620
he did he has a show on nbc why we talk about that anyway

01:09:16.620 --> 01:09:21.100
uh... that's way too much time for him already no

01:09:21.100 --> 01:09:24.820
so i i got to play the game i'd like to i'd just don't think i could play it

01:09:24.820 --> 01:09:27.760
every day but it's a nice is like it's something that i think what i i'd have

01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:31.360
fun playing in between games of the year

01:09:31.360 --> 01:09:35.080
now taken a debt to them for uh... the psp

01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:36.580
all

01:09:36.580 --> 01:09:40.180
it's awesome it's it's great and you're what i'd be like

01:09:40.180 --> 01:09:43.140
looking at the end like how the hell is gonna work because

01:09:43.140 --> 01:09:45.940
I mean, you can't obviously beat the PlayStation with...

01:09:45.940 --> 01:09:48.740
I was gonna say, how can...

01:09:48.740 --> 01:09:53.440
When I think of Tycho Nutatigen on PSP, I think about Beatmania on the Game Boy,

01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:57.140
or on the Wonderswan even, and I kinda like...

01:09:57.140 --> 01:10:00.540
Beatmania on the Wonderswan was great! It was digitized!

01:10:00.540 --> 01:10:02.340
Yeah, it was, but...

01:10:02.340 --> 01:10:06.840
I mean, playing with the buttons and the control pad... nah, the play was missing.

01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:11.740
It works very simple. Basically, on the Tycho Drum, your main

01:10:11.740 --> 01:10:17.380
stuff is going to be either the directional pad or the buttons. So, you know, the left

01:10:17.380 --> 01:10:21.580
drum would be the directional pad and the right drum would be the four buttons. And

01:10:21.580 --> 01:10:26.300
then to hit the sides are the L button and the R button. And so that's how the game's

01:10:26.300 --> 01:10:31.380
played. And it's really simple, easy to figure out. The mini games are fucking hilarious.

01:10:31.380 --> 01:10:37.340
They're great. And they get really hard. So, and it's a lot of fun. Really, I'd highly

01:10:37.340 --> 01:10:42.480
recommend the game when it comes out here. It's right now only in Japan, but it looks

01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:46.340
really good. It's a good start for music games, though, on the PSP, because it's done very,

01:10:46.340 --> 01:10:52.740
very well. Can't wait to play it. It has Toxic on it, which I thought was weird. Toxic, and

01:10:52.740 --> 01:10:54.340
there was a couple other songs that were really strange.

01:10:54.340 --> 01:10:56.540
Is this the Japanese version of Taiko, or is this American?

01:10:56.540 --> 01:10:57.540
Yeah, this is Japanese.

01:10:57.540 --> 01:10:59.740
And they had Toxic? I don't remember that being on any of them.

01:10:59.740 --> 01:11:05.220
They had Toxic on there. They have We Will Rock You. They also have, of course, you know,

01:11:05.220 --> 01:11:13.220
and some other weird songs on there, Ridge Racer and stuff, and it was fun, they have all the sounds you can unlock.

01:11:13.220 --> 01:11:19.220
It sounds very similar to the US release Taiko Drum Master, but on the PSP in Japanese.

01:11:19.220 --> 01:11:24.220
Like the songs you're saying, I'm thinking, yeah, that wasn't Taiko Drum Master.

01:11:24.220 --> 01:11:27.220
I couldn't tell you, but it's fun. I like it.

01:11:27.220 --> 01:11:29.220
Interesting.

01:11:29.220 --> 01:11:32.220
Wow, we've played a whole lot of new music-based games these past couple of weeks.

01:11:32.220 --> 01:11:36.220
I've been playing Burnout 3. That's not really a music-based game, but it's fun.

01:11:36.220 --> 01:11:41.220
Well, I'll talk about some. I've been playing Illuminus, which is kind of like half a music game.

01:11:41.220 --> 01:11:46.220
I have all three copies of my, um, Puppies on order.

01:11:46.220 --> 01:11:51.220
Ooh. Ooh, I didn't know that Technic Beat was coming out on PSP.

01:11:51.220 --> 01:11:56.220
Ooh, I have all three copies of my, um, Puppies on order.

01:11:56.220 --> 01:12:01.220
Ooh, I didn't know that Technic Beat was coming out on PSP.

01:12:01.220 --> 01:12:11.220
That's awesome. What was Technic Beat again? Technic Beat was that one with the little dude that walked around it with all the circles and you'd have to walk to the circle and hit the button.

01:12:11.220 --> 01:12:23.220
Yeah, and as a reminder also that DJ Max is coming out on the PSP. That one's going to be weird though. That's going to be playing just like, I think, Beatmania on the PSP. It's going to be a little weird.

01:12:23.220 --> 01:12:26.220
Interesting. But cool. I'm still very excited about it.

01:12:26.220 --> 01:12:30.780
that. Alrighty, I think what we're going to do now is we're going to go ahead and take

01:12:30.780 --> 01:12:39.300
a break, and when we come back from this break, we're going to do a little bit of Skype and

01:12:39.300 --> 01:12:45.220
hear what the callers have to say. So, we'll do that. First off though, I want to see if

01:12:45.220 --> 01:12:52.540
I can find this. I wanted to play some songs from the new, if I could find it, maybe I

01:12:52.540 --> 01:13:00.540
I don't have it. I don't want to say what it was if I don't really have it. Never mind, I'll have to look for that for later.

01:13:00.540 --> 01:13:06.540
And also, we'd like to thank our listeners who voted for us for the podcast awards. Absolutely.

01:13:06.540 --> 01:13:11.540
Thank you. Best meetings on the podcast, that's right. Kisses. Looking at us. Thank you.

01:13:11.540 --> 01:13:16.540
And also, did you know that this week we're featured on the iTunes store? I saw that we're on page two. Isn't that crazy? Yeah.

01:13:16.540 --> 01:13:21.540
I don't know how that happened, but we're there. That's pretty awesome. I'm not going to complain. Hell no.

01:13:21.540 --> 01:13:27.540
Oh, and I have to apologize for last week, or not really last week.

01:13:27.540 --> 01:13:29.540
All we had was a headset microphone, first of all.

01:13:29.540 --> 01:13:35.540
But the week before last, with Katamari radio that we were pretty much doing.

01:13:35.540 --> 01:13:39.540
Because we had We Love Katamari at Dark Sakura's house.

01:13:39.540 --> 01:13:42.540
Oh, I was going to play music from We Heart Katamari.

01:13:42.540 --> 01:13:45.540
You'll see inch widescreen katamari.

01:13:45.540 --> 01:13:48.540
That game is so much fun. I love it.

01:13:48.540 --> 01:13:52.540
The Namco X Capcom intro looked very cool on my TV.

01:13:52.540 --> 01:13:57.540
Yeah, I'm going to probably delete that game just because I don't know how to play it and it's all in Japanese.

01:13:57.540 --> 01:14:01.540
I actually don't delete it yet because I want it.

01:14:01.540 --> 01:14:07.540
You need to show me where to get that thing you have.

01:14:07.540 --> 01:14:10.540
Alright, we're going to go to break and we're going to come back and have the Skype line.

01:14:10.540 --> 01:14:16.780
be back after this. Also, DDR with fire when we come back. We'll do some Bahmani potpourri

01:14:16.780 --> 01:14:21.140
in this break. We'll start off with a little bit of Taku. Maybe this will perk Dark Soccer

01:14:21.140 --> 01:14:28.140
up a little bit of Taku. Yay! Alright, here we go. We'll be back after this.

01:15:21.140 --> 01:15:23.140
Oh

01:16:21.140 --> 01:16:31.140
Can you keep me like a nasty girl, you want a nasty love?

01:16:31.140 --> 01:16:38.140
I know that you want me honey, I'm feeding some more people, better stay healthy for love

01:16:38.140 --> 01:16:45.140
You know that I want baby love, just to feel my heart

01:16:45.140 --> 01:16:49.140
Talking about you has to be my meaning

01:16:50.140 --> 01:16:53.140
I'm just asking for the real love

01:16:53.140 --> 01:16:55.140
It's gonna make me feel

01:16:55.140 --> 01:16:59.140
To take me higher

01:17:00.140 --> 01:17:02.140
Hey, I'm not having enough

01:17:02.140 --> 01:17:06.140
To try to make sure that you're still

01:17:07.140 --> 01:17:10.140
Hey, I'm sorry but you've got to try to

01:17:10.140 --> 01:17:12.140
You've gotta be still

01:17:12.140 --> 01:17:16.140
Seein' we're together ever more

01:17:16.140 --> 01:17:19.140
Shine on me forever

01:17:19.140 --> 01:17:21.140
Shine on me

01:17:21.140 --> 01:17:24.140
Shine on me forever

01:17:24.140 --> 01:17:29.380
Shining on the lightning Sheen

01:17:54.140 --> 01:18:00.140
Yes I, I have a dream of you

01:18:00.140 --> 01:18:03.140
I'm getting out of my own way

01:18:03.140 --> 01:18:06.140
But I belong to you

01:18:06.140 --> 01:18:25.660
Rainy days on my hands without you, Rainy days on my feet around you,

01:18:25.660 --> 01:18:31.020
I feel better when I remember yesterday, yeah.

01:18:31.020 --> 01:18:38.020
Memories in my heart are not the same Memories in my mind seem to be real

01:18:38.020 --> 01:18:43.020
What I wanted to tell about my yesterday

01:18:43.020 --> 01:18:49.020
In the night I was away for sure But I had no fear to break my heart

01:18:49.020 --> 01:18:56.020
In the light the sun is on my side When I had the right thing

01:18:56.020 --> 01:19:00.160
Screaming again today

01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:02.460
I had a dream of you

01:19:02.460 --> 01:19:06.240
I gave your love away

01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:08.340
But I belong to you

01:19:08.340 --> 01:19:12.200
Screaming again today

01:19:12.200 --> 01:19:14.580
I had a dream of you

01:19:14.580 --> 01:19:18.220
I gave your love away

01:19:18.220 --> 01:19:23.220
That I belong to you

01:19:23.220 --> 01:19:28.220
Green Bay

01:19:28.220 --> 01:19:33.220
Green Bay

01:19:33.220 --> 01:19:38.220
Green Bay

01:19:38.220 --> 01:19:43.220
Green Bay

01:20:43.220 --> 01:20:59.220
Solid Snake, Solid Snake, Solid Snake, Can you hear what I'm saying?

01:20:59.220 --> 01:21:02.220
Roll this down, let's take a man, better watch your back

01:21:02.220 --> 01:21:05.220
I'm gonna kick your asses, beat them, kill them all

01:21:05.220 --> 01:21:12.220
Tom, Tom what am I gonna do? Tom, Tom what am I gonna do? Tom, what am I gonna do? Tom, Tom.

01:21:15.220 --> 01:21:17.220
Have you ever seen a cool game like this?

01:21:18.220 --> 01:21:19.220
They don't care.

01:21:24.220 --> 01:21:26.220
Gaming Radio, so uncensored

01:21:28.220 --> 01:21:30.220
that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.

01:21:30.220 --> 01:21:32.220
Uh, Mooch, uh, Moo-Kaw-Kee?

01:21:32.220 --> 01:21:34.220
Orange Lounge Radio.

01:22:04.220 --> 01:22:10.100
Tap Break, Taku with Electro-Tuned, not only 2DX 3rd style I think it was originally in,

01:22:10.100 --> 01:22:20.100
DDR 5th Mix as well, Risky Men featuring Suka with Mr. T, Take Me Higher, Asuga, 2DX 4th

01:22:20.100 --> 01:22:24.540
style as well as...wasn't anyone into DDR's 5th Mix, DDR, I think?

01:22:24.540 --> 01:22:26.580
I think it was one of those unlocks, remember how...

01:22:26.580 --> 01:22:27.580
It was in 5th Mix.

01:22:27.580 --> 01:22:29.340
Yeah, remember how 5th Mix had all those unlocks in it?

01:22:29.340 --> 01:22:31.460
I think Electro-Tuned was also one of those songs.

01:22:31.460 --> 01:22:33.540
Yeah, Electro-Tuned was in 5th Mix.

01:22:33.540 --> 01:22:37.680
Cherry with Yesterday. Boy, we played a lot of songs that crossed over in other

01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:41.920
Bamani games that break without even realizing it. Cherry Yesterday was, was that actually

01:22:41.920 --> 01:22:46.420
in Para Para? It was in Para Para. Yes, it was. Was it? It was in a second. You had,

01:22:46.420 --> 01:22:50.140
it started off with the right arm sweep, left arm sweep, both arms. That scares me that

01:22:50.140 --> 01:22:54.540
you remember that. Yeah, that's like all I remember of it too. In 2DX6 style, of course.

01:22:54.540 --> 01:22:59.260
There was a Para song in 6 style that wasn't actually in Para Para Paradise. I think it,

01:22:59.260 --> 01:23:02.180
I think it's the song, Para Para Paradise. That's it. That's why I'm getting confused.

01:23:02.180 --> 01:23:03.460
You remember that song in 6.01?

01:23:03.460 --> 01:23:04.820
Pah-dah-pah-dah-pah-dah-dah-dice.

01:23:04.820 --> 01:23:05.940
That song wasn't in.

01:23:05.940 --> 01:23:07.300
That song was a pain in the ass.

01:23:07.300 --> 01:23:07.780
Yeah.

01:23:07.780 --> 01:23:11.780
Anyway, um, also, um, a Konami original there, the Metal Gear Solid, um,

01:23:12.740 --> 01:23:17.300
mix from Beatmania, like, hell, that wasn't the very first Beatmania, wasn't it?

01:23:18.100 --> 01:23:20.580
It might have been Beatmania 3rd Mix when that came in.

01:23:20.580 --> 01:23:22.180
Uh, the Metal Gear one?

01:23:22.180 --> 01:23:22.660
Yeah.

01:23:22.660 --> 01:23:23.780
Uh, yeah.

01:23:23.780 --> 01:23:25.700
Wasn't it dated, like, all the way back to the very first Beatmania?

01:23:25.700 --> 01:23:25.860
No.

01:23:26.500 --> 01:23:26.980
No, no.

01:23:26.980 --> 01:23:29.700
It was, it was 3rd Mix, I believe.

01:23:29.700 --> 01:23:30.180
You know why?

01:23:30.180 --> 01:23:30.900
Because Beatmania-

01:23:30.900 --> 01:23:35.400
It definitely was Third Mix, because that's when, um, that was when I first played. It was on a Third Mix machine.

01:23:35.400 --> 01:23:39.400
First Mix, Second Append, and, like, Third Mix all looked the same.

01:23:39.400 --> 01:23:45.400
Well, First and Second were, um, were released as one, with the Append.

01:23:45.400 --> 01:23:46.400
Oh, that's right, that's right.

01:23:46.400 --> 01:23:47.400
The Ebisu.

01:23:47.400 --> 01:23:47.900
Mm-hmm.

01:23:47.900 --> 01:23:51.400
And then there was Third, Fourth, because, uh...

01:23:51.400 --> 01:23:53.400
And they were all Appends, weren't they?

01:23:53.400 --> 01:23:54.400
Yes, Fifth.

01:23:54.400 --> 01:23:56.400
Until they got to Sixth.

01:23:56.400 --> 01:23:58.900
Right, Sixth is the one I don't have. I have Club Mix.

01:23:58.900 --> 01:23:59.900
Mm-hmm.

01:23:59.900 --> 01:24:02.900
I have, um, Club 2, I think.

01:24:02.900 --> 01:24:03.900
Can you imagine if they did that-

01:24:03.900 --> 01:24:04.900
I have GoToMix.

01:24:04.900 --> 01:24:07.900
Can you imagine if they did that append thing here in the US?

01:24:07.900 --> 01:24:13.900
Like, in order to play, uh, DDR Extreme, you have to have, uh, DDR USA, the old school one.

01:24:13.900 --> 01:24:16.900
I can't believe that the pub- that the general public response would be,

01:24:16.900 --> 01:24:17.900
BITCH, WHAT?

01:24:17.900 --> 01:24:19.900
Exactly. Exactly.

01:24:19.900 --> 01:24:21.900
Nintendo can get away with that shit.

01:24:21.900 --> 01:24:23.900
Yeah, we're gonna release three different versions of Nintendo,

01:24:23.900 --> 01:24:24.900
cause you're gonna buy them all.

01:24:24.900 --> 01:24:25.900
Um, but yet-

01:24:25.900 --> 01:24:27.900
Okay, Nintendo, we love you, bye bye.

01:24:27.900 --> 01:24:28.900
Exactly.

01:24:28.900 --> 01:24:31.900
Okay Nintendo, just put out another Zelda game and we'll be fine.

01:24:34.900 --> 01:24:35.900
Anyway.

01:24:35.900 --> 01:24:37.900
That's how they get you started.

01:24:37.900 --> 01:24:38.900
I got told.

01:24:38.900 --> 01:24:41.900
Electro-Tuned was actually in second style.

01:24:41.900 --> 01:24:43.900
So I forgot. I forgot.

01:24:43.900 --> 01:24:47.900
You know why? Because I'm used to playing it in third style PS2.

01:24:47.900 --> 01:24:48.900
Give me a break.

01:24:49.900 --> 01:24:50.900
No, that's all cool.

01:24:53.900 --> 01:24:54.900
Let's see.

01:24:54.900 --> 01:24:56.900
Oh, also I wanted to say about the Metal Gear Solid theme.

01:24:56.900 --> 01:25:01.580
going to be in the upcoming Beatmania USA, at least if the E3 demo is in the

01:25:01.580 --> 01:25:04.260
indication. That's a game we really haven't heard anything about for quite

01:25:04.260 --> 01:25:07.260
some time, but it kind of makes sense because, you know, we got two DDR's

01:25:07.260 --> 01:25:11.220
looming. I'm assuming that Konami staff is kind of busy with those games and

01:25:11.220 --> 01:25:16.300
they'll worry about Beatmania when those two are out. I think there was a date

01:25:16.300 --> 01:25:21.300
change or something about it. It's still in spring. I think Miklotov is back on the

01:25:21.300 --> 01:25:25.020
show next week. I do think he's planning a trip up here next week, so although

01:25:25.020 --> 01:25:31.020
Although he's been very tight on his NDA this year and hasn't been able to give us much juicy gossip on the show,

01:25:31.020 --> 01:25:34.020
hopefully we'll be able to get something out of him next week. At least something.

01:25:34.020 --> 01:25:40.020
And also the heads of a bunch of game companies are coming to my work at the end of August.

01:25:40.020 --> 01:25:43.020
So I'm going to get the smooths with the head of Konami.

01:25:43.020 --> 01:25:45.020
Take those orange on the radio press kits.

01:25:45.020 --> 01:25:47.020
I will be taking the press kits.

01:25:47.020 --> 01:25:49.020
Hopefully we didn't bash too many of their products.

01:25:49.020 --> 01:25:53.980
ahead, we're going to have the head of, what was it, they're going to be, I think, Microsoft

01:25:53.980 --> 01:26:01.580
is coming, Ubisoft, Konami, well, there's about 25 invites at least that they're going

01:26:01.580 --> 01:26:02.580
out to.

01:26:02.580 --> 01:26:07.220
Now, tell that Konami dude that they need to release a freaking press release on Extreme

01:26:07.220 --> 01:26:11.900
2 already. No, I know you're not really going to do that. You know there was a hint dropped

01:26:11.900 --> 01:26:16.500
on the DER forums this week, though. Dancer X, which is one of those guys that we all

01:26:16.500 --> 01:26:20.140
I know it has something to do with Konami, but doesn't really advertise it.

01:26:20.140 --> 01:26:25.500
He came and it said, expect a small wave of information in the near future.

01:26:25.500 --> 01:26:29.780
Well, we already found about, was it, there was more Ultramix 3 info.

01:26:29.780 --> 01:26:31.380
Yes, there was more Ultramix 3 info.

01:26:31.380 --> 01:26:33.060
I'm glad you brought that up.

01:26:33.060 --> 01:26:36.660
That was also a DDR Freak forum thing.

01:26:36.660 --> 01:26:39.380
One of the users on there, who I know I've seen their name before,

01:26:39.380 --> 01:26:40.380
is a show listener.

01:26:40.380 --> 01:26:42.420
So hello, guy, if you're listening.

01:26:42.420 --> 01:26:46.420
That was actually Same, who sent the email to Zonk's official website

01:26:46.420 --> 01:26:51.540
asking if they have songs in DDR Ultramix 3 and to come back, yes, DDR Ultramix 3 will

01:26:51.540 --> 01:26:57.260
feature a song by Zonk and a remix by Zonk.

01:26:57.260 --> 01:27:02.420
I forgot, what was I going to say, I looked back, I had to dive back in the archives in

01:27:02.420 --> 01:27:06.520
my live journal back in the day, remember when I found there was a whole unprotected

01:27:06.520 --> 01:27:11.020
section of Zonk's website that had a bunch of info about, that had a bunch of like graphics

01:27:11.020 --> 01:27:13.780
and stuff that were used in the song.

01:27:13.780 --> 01:27:20.260
they don't have that anymore. Apparently, ddrfreak managed to dig up this post that

01:27:20.260 --> 01:27:27.900
said, the forbidden dance dance Basile from the Orifice release will be in UltraMix 3.

01:27:27.900 --> 01:27:36.380
It's a weird song. Orifice was the folks that did Art of Hot, also. Orifice is just one

01:27:36.380 --> 01:27:40.100
of the guys from Zonk, also, if you didn't know that. Orifice and Zonk are kind of related.

01:27:40.100 --> 01:27:46.100
Orifice is just one of the guys from Zonk. And I think their song, Art of Hot, I think was the name of it? Or was that another group?

01:27:46.100 --> 01:27:54.100
I can't remember. It's one of those songs, I have to admit, I love the Zonk song in UltraMix too, but I don't really play the Orifice song very much, sorry to say.

01:27:54.100 --> 01:27:56.100
I wasn't a big fan of that.

01:27:56.100 --> 01:27:57.100
Yeah.

01:27:57.100 --> 01:28:03.100
So we know that the, so it's very interesting how many folks are coming back.

01:28:03.100 --> 01:28:08.100
Oh I screwed up. The name of the song is I Spy. I found a clip of it. Here it is. Art of Hot was another band.

01:28:08.100 --> 01:28:10.100
That's the orifice one.

01:28:13.100 --> 01:28:16.100
And you can kind of see the similarities there to Zonk.

01:28:21.100 --> 01:28:25.100
Rene posted us a link in the chatroom on Konami's official website.

01:28:25.100 --> 01:28:28.100
They're still saying Spring 2006 for BeatMania.

01:28:28.100 --> 01:28:30.100
There's an official little link there.

01:28:30.100 --> 01:28:32.100
Yeah, I think it's still Spring.

01:28:32.100 --> 01:28:34.100
I'll ask them. I'll bug them.

01:28:34.100 --> 01:28:39.100
Because what's great about, you know, it's just, I don't know, I know the most about games.

01:28:39.100 --> 01:28:42.100
It's just what it comes down to.

01:28:42.100 --> 01:28:48.100
Just find out already if Cartoon Heroes is going to be in Xtreme 2 or not so we can shut these people on DDR Freak up.

01:28:48.100 --> 01:28:49.100
Okay.

01:28:49.100 --> 01:28:50.100
Alright.

01:28:50.100 --> 01:28:54.100
Anyway, um, I guess we should open up the Skype line.

01:28:54.100 --> 01:28:56.100
See if we can get some calls.

01:28:56.100 --> 01:28:58.100
We've had people asking.

01:28:58.100 --> 01:28:59.100
Alright.

01:28:59.100 --> 01:29:01.100
Well, I'm firing up Skype right now.

01:29:01.100 --> 01:29:02.100
Logging in.

01:29:02.100 --> 01:29:03.100
Beep, beep, beep. Here we go.

01:29:03.100 --> 01:29:06.340
I should see if there's been any upgrades to Skype recently.

01:29:06.340 --> 01:29:09.740
You know you should check Skype's website often because they do fix their program quite

01:29:09.740 --> 01:29:10.740
often.

01:29:10.740 --> 01:29:11.740
They always release new ones.

01:29:11.740 --> 01:29:15.540
So, did you know, by the way, we have like 61 people on our list on Skype.

01:29:15.540 --> 01:29:16.780
I think that's kind of cool.

01:29:16.780 --> 01:29:19.980
Okay, so I just logged on to Skype and there's only like five people in.

01:29:19.980 --> 01:29:21.620
What's up with that?

01:29:21.620 --> 01:29:23.260
Well, we're up and running.

01:29:23.260 --> 01:29:26.540

And I just dropped my mouse, which is really smooth.

01:29:40.020 --> 01:29:41.020
Yes, DarkSakura.

01:29:41.020 --> 01:29:43.140
That's what I think I'm about.

01:29:43.140 --> 01:29:45.340
Oh, me dropping my mouse, yeah.

01:29:45.340 --> 01:29:46.900
Oh, look, we got a call.

01:29:46.900 --> 01:29:47.900
Let's take it.

01:29:47.900 --> 01:29:49.700
Oh, this is a guy that used to call us like all the freaking time.

01:29:49.700 --> 01:29:51.340
We haven't talked to him in a while.

01:29:51.340 --> 01:29:52.340
Let's do this.

01:29:52.340 --> 01:29:55.180
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:29:55.180 --> 01:29:56.180
Legend of Zaku here.

01:29:56.180 --> 01:29:59.180
Hello, Legend of Zaku. Long time no chat.

01:29:59.180 --> 01:30:02.180
I know. I finally got broadband, so now I can do this.

01:30:02.180 --> 01:30:05.180
And I'm in the middle of a storm, so I'm going to try to make this real quick.

01:30:05.180 --> 01:30:08.180
Alright. Congratulations on the broadband upgrade.

01:30:08.180 --> 01:30:13.180
Yeah, man. Anyways, I could vouch for you for the whole In The Groove 2 thing.

01:30:13.180 --> 01:30:14.180
How so?

01:30:14.180 --> 01:30:19.180
Because I've been already playing this game since, what, July?

01:30:19.180 --> 01:30:21.180
Last month?

01:30:21.180 --> 01:30:25.080
That's all I've been doing, playing in the groove in Coney Island and Chinatown.

01:30:25.080 --> 01:30:28.620
So I can pretty much say it's a big improvement from the first one.

01:30:28.620 --> 01:30:29.620
Really?

01:30:29.620 --> 01:30:32.060
I don't know if that's really vouching for me, but okay.

01:30:32.060 --> 01:30:35.380
Item by item, can you name how it's better?

01:30:35.380 --> 01:30:36.380
Let me see.

01:30:36.380 --> 01:30:41.060
Freeze rules, the fact that, you know, it's just a, you know, with the new cabinet and

01:30:41.060 --> 01:30:44.820
the fact that the pads aren't as, you know, aren't as just crappy as, you know, as if

01:30:44.820 --> 01:30:47.260
you were actually putting it in a DDR machine.

01:30:47.260 --> 01:30:50.600
Let me state this too, maybe I should have gotten this out because, and this is one thing

01:30:50.600 --> 01:30:54.400
where I may have said that in the group two looks exactly like in the group one because

01:30:54.400 --> 01:30:58.840
the machine it ain't on the break is an upgraded old cabinet, you know, like a DDR cabinet

01:30:58.840 --> 01:30:59.840
from back in the day.

01:30:59.840 --> 01:31:00.840
Exactly.

01:31:00.840 --> 01:31:01.840
So...

01:31:01.840 --> 01:31:02.840
Most of the new machines...

01:31:02.840 --> 01:31:04.440
To in the group's credit, that might be part of the reason why I'm feeling that way.

01:31:04.440 --> 01:31:06.120
I didn't see a new build.

01:31:06.120 --> 01:31:10.880
Most of the in the group two machines are brand new in the city.

01:31:10.880 --> 01:31:11.880
Well I missed them.

01:31:11.880 --> 01:31:12.880
So...

01:31:12.880 --> 01:31:14.160
Zaku, you should have called me while I was out there.

01:31:14.160 --> 01:31:19.680
Hey, I didn't have broadband, I was getting my broadband set up last week, so eh, to that.

01:31:19.680 --> 01:31:22.560
I may be coming back. I may be coming back very soon.

01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:27.560
Are you sure about it? You know digital life expo is happening in October.

01:31:27.560 --> 01:31:32.360
I know, I know, but I don't know if I can swing the time off work.

01:31:32.360 --> 01:31:34.680
I mean, it's worth it. I mean, you know, think about it.

01:31:34.680 --> 01:31:38.520
What would persuade you to actually go there and bring the rest of the people so that way

01:31:38.520 --> 01:31:39.720
you could broadcast it live?

01:31:39.720 --> 01:31:42.400
It's not about persuading me. It's about persuading my boss, and I'm sure

01:31:42.400 --> 01:31:44.800
Loki and Dark Sakura feel similar.

01:31:44.800 --> 01:31:47.720
Especially that Dark Sakura will be a newlywed at the time.

01:31:47.720 --> 01:31:54.720
Oh, it's the simple fact that I'm having to beg for two days of work, and I'm only going to have three remaining for the rest of the year after I get married.

01:31:54.720 --> 01:31:59.720
Me, personally, I would love to come out there if I can get the time off, which I don't know if it's very likely.

01:31:59.720 --> 01:32:05.720
I did see the advertisement about the tournament. It's tempting. I think I'd know more people in an NYC tournament.

01:32:05.720 --> 01:32:09.720
Hopefully I should be competing there this year again, like I did last.

01:32:09.720 --> 01:32:13.720
Let me put it this way, Zaku, I'm not saying no yet. I am considering the idea.

01:32:13.720 --> 01:32:19.720
Oh, one more thing. As you already know, we New Yorkers already have an unlocked 2DX11 Red kit.

01:32:19.720 --> 01:32:22.720
Yes, I've already played 2DX11 Red.

01:32:22.720 --> 01:32:24.720
Where did 2DX Red go in New York?

01:32:24.720 --> 01:32:28.720
This place called Tri-County Fair in Long Island.

01:32:28.720 --> 01:32:31.720
Oh, okay. See, I didn't get a chance to go to Coney Island at all.

01:32:31.720 --> 01:32:34.720
I mean, there's a lot in New York City, as you know.

01:32:34.720 --> 01:32:37.720
So I didn't get a chance to really do everything. That's why I want to go back.

01:32:37.720 --> 01:32:42.720
It's an unlocked machine, so we pretty much have all the other unlocks since the kit is straight from Japan.

01:32:42.720 --> 01:32:47.520
it's used you know I had heard something about an in the groove 2

01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:52.880
machine that opened up somewhere in Michigan and it already had everything

01:32:52.880 --> 01:32:56.000
unlocked and all these people saw all these new songs they weren't supposed to

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:59.520
and then the next day the lock was back on and all the songs were gone and they

01:32:59.520 --> 01:33:03.640
didn't realize the anyway I don't know I don't know why that's all I don't know

01:33:03.640 --> 01:33:05.980
why I thought to mention that I just kind of remembered that right now

01:33:05.980 --> 01:33:09.960
because I was hearing this story just like yesterday so anyway I'm throwing

01:33:09.960 --> 01:33:17.200
that out there. Yeah man, that's what's been going on in New York so far. So this Digital

01:33:17.200 --> 01:33:20.780
Life tournament that's coming up, is this the one where they're giving away like thousands

01:33:20.780 --> 01:33:25.000
of dollars or something for the freestyle? Yes, two grand is the grand prize for most

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:29.680
if not all the events in the first place. So I know, now is Digital Life the same one

01:33:29.680 --> 01:33:34.800
that Frequency went to last year and we interviewed him after that and he had had the run in with

01:33:34.800 --> 01:33:36.760
like much music and stuff?

01:33:36.760 --> 01:33:47.760
Yeah, I basically told him about how you wanted to interview him and all that.

01:33:47.760 --> 01:33:49.480
Yeah, I remember that.

01:33:49.480 --> 01:33:54.280
So yeah, I would love to go to that event if I can make it work, I don't know if I can.

01:33:54.280 --> 01:33:55.280
But I will try.

01:33:55.280 --> 01:33:57.360
See what you can do, man.

01:33:57.360 --> 01:34:01.640
We would love to have you out there, and at least that would be good promotion-wise for

01:34:01.640 --> 01:34:02.640
Orange Lounge.

01:34:02.640 --> 01:34:03.840
I'm not thinking about it.

01:34:03.840 --> 01:34:05.140
Loki, what do you think?

01:34:05.140 --> 01:34:07.040
If Dark Soccer can't go, you want to go?

01:34:07.040 --> 01:34:11.440
I don't want to sit next to another grandpa on Southwest.

01:34:11.440 --> 01:34:12.640
Somebody's got to go with me.

01:34:12.640 --> 01:34:14.040
Well, hopefully Nellie will have a car,

01:34:14.040 --> 01:34:15.840
because I'm kind of driving her to work.

01:34:15.840 --> 01:34:16.640
Oh, all right.

01:34:16.640 --> 01:34:17.140
Well, we'll see.

01:34:17.140 --> 01:34:18.040
We'll see what happens.

01:34:18.040 --> 01:34:18.840
I don't know.

01:34:18.840 --> 01:34:19.340
All right.

01:34:19.340 --> 01:34:20.740
So what are you going to be doing for the digital life?

01:34:20.740 --> 01:34:23.040
I assume if there's $2,000 on the line, you're going to be.

01:34:23.040 --> 01:34:24.040
Yeah, freestyle.

01:34:24.040 --> 01:34:27.240
I mean, I'm going to be entering freestyle, like I did last.

01:34:27.240 --> 01:34:29.140
Have you picked your song yet?

01:34:29.140 --> 01:34:31.940
I think I'm planning on doing Swing It from Fifth Mix,

01:34:31.940 --> 01:34:38.340
trying to dress up like Pee Wee Herman with the platform shoes, red bow tie, the buzz cut,

01:34:39.220 --> 01:34:42.900
the whole thing, the whole nine yards for that one. That's thinking about it. It's getting close

01:34:42.900 --> 01:34:54.180
to that. That's dedicated. No, I love it. Most of the veteran freestylers in, you know, in the city,

01:34:54.180 --> 01:34:58.500
basically, you know, they really like that, you know, they really have some good positive,

01:34:58.500 --> 01:35:01.940
you know, positive impressions on it when I first told it to him.

01:35:01.940 --> 01:35:07.420
This would be Legend of Zaku doing Freestyle at the Digital Life tournament.

01:35:07.420 --> 01:35:14.420
Oh God.

01:35:17.300 --> 01:35:22.680
Anyway, that had to be it. No, that's cool. I hope it works out for you.

01:35:22.680 --> 01:35:26.900
Yeah. Well, I will see what I can do. Any other news you wanna share?

01:35:26.900 --> 01:35:31.660
Mmm, that's about it. I told you what's been happening so far and what we already have.

01:35:31.660 --> 01:35:36.900
Mmm, just waiting for October to roll by, pretty much.

01:35:36.900 --> 01:35:39.400
Alright, so this tournament's gonna be big news then, huh?

01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:40.400
Yeah.

01:35:40.400 --> 01:35:41.400
Alright, well we'll...

01:35:41.400 --> 01:35:43.900
I just hope you could try to pull something.

01:35:43.900 --> 01:35:47.900
We'll see, but all you other East Coasters, I know we have other East Coasters listening to the show,

01:35:47.900 --> 01:35:51.900
make your way out to this tournament because it's gonna be frickin' huge and they're giving away money, lots of it.

01:35:51.900 --> 01:35:52.900
Money, money, money.

01:35:52.900 --> 01:35:53.900
Yeah.

01:35:53.900 --> 01:35:57.220
low-key loads of money being given away doesn't just

01:35:57.220 --> 01:35:59.500
is at least try man

01:35:59.500 --> 01:36:01.180

the constructive feedback in the chair of the were really mellow tonight

01:36:52.140 --> 01:36:56.720
night but i have to mention i think the picture of me doing this show

01:36:56.720 --> 01:36:58.960
because they're doing that will article

01:36:58.960 --> 01:37:02.040

uh... but i don't really like it i don't want the retarded pictures

01:37:15.840 --> 01:37:19.280
I want a non-retarded picture. That's what I was looking for.

01:37:19.280 --> 01:37:23.080
And unfortunately, every single picture I've taken of, you know, me,

01:37:23.080 --> 01:37:27.280
has been a retarded one. I'm not retarded, so why do my pictures come out retarded?

01:37:27.280 --> 01:37:28.280
That's what I want to know.

01:37:28.280 --> 01:37:32.880
Oh yeah, a picture of my foot. That would be perfect.

01:37:32.880 --> 01:37:36.080
Send the picture of your feet over from the second OB.

01:37:36.080 --> 01:37:41.000
No! What?

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:44.760
Okay, now Loki, we've just had a bit of anger, so let's, Dark Sakura, let's further

01:37:44.760 --> 01:37:49.240
us down the un-mellow spiral what's there's somebody on the gorillas board I

and you don't want to know what though this isn't the only person that I have

01:38:31.240 --> 01:38:37.360
seen this happen seen say stuff like this on a variety of boards that they

01:38:37.360 --> 01:38:41.600
think that the primary character in a game is named after the game after the

01:38:41.600 --> 01:38:44.940
game when they're like did you know that when you play Legend of Zelda you're

01:38:44.940 --> 01:38:51.680
actually playing Zelda moving around I know I know but it's just I would say

01:38:51.680 --> 01:38:55.160
that is you know people if you're gonna be a fan of the game actually know

01:38:55.160 --> 01:38:59.000
something about it but it messy in some cases you lock out there you look you

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.800
luck out you luck out because the Super Mario Brothers you actually play as

01:39:01.800 --> 01:39:10.800
Super Mario yeah but I've heard people call Luigi Mario 2 and green Mario this

01:39:10.800 --> 01:39:17.960
green Mario. Yes, I kid you not. Alright. I just, I dug this up and I had to play it

01:39:17.960 --> 01:39:22.760
because it's been like three weeks since I've done this, so I need, I need a little bit,

01:39:22.760 --> 01:39:26.600
I need a little pick-me-up. I need a little bit of un-mellow here. God! I already know

01:39:26.600 --> 01:39:35.960
what this is. Hey, Loki, what do you think about gay sex? Oh, it's so much fun. Then

01:39:35.960 --> 01:39:40.280
I'll never get old, will it? Actually, it will get old. Cause there's another joke we

01:39:40.280 --> 01:39:44.360
used to do the same thing for. I know. But then you'll just do something stupid and we'll

01:39:44.360 --> 01:39:51.200
have something else. Hey! I forgot, well I actually didn't forget to mention, um, September

01:39:51.200 --> 01:39:58.720
11th. No, you're not using that picture! Thank you to the chatroom listener who sent us that

01:39:58.720 --> 01:40:05.880
picture of Loki. Who did that? Yes, you have picked the most retarded shot of me, and-

01:40:05.880 --> 01:40:12.880
I was going to say, whatever those things are, that internet joke needs to die.

01:40:35.880 --> 01:40:41.960
die whitey andy but that's not that i think i think i mean anyway um... you're

01:40:41.960 --> 01:40:45.560
it's it's some catchphrase that started the whole thing i don't remember

01:40:45.560 --> 01:40:49.960
okay wait but that was not an actual whitey m n d site that was the

01:40:49.960 --> 01:40:51.360
uh... knockoff

01:40:51.360 --> 01:40:54.300
uh... whitey m n d site that's actually some of these placeholder for the real

01:40:54.300 --> 01:40:54.780
site

01:40:54.780 --> 01:40:57.020
however we had another listener

01:40:57.020 --> 01:40:58.160
head on over

01:40:58.160 --> 01:41:02.420
to whitey m n d and actually came up with this and i'm letting this up right

01:41:02.420 --> 01:41:03.600
now for the chat

01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:04.820
are for uh...

01:41:04.820 --> 01:41:08.440
dark sakura to uh... i'm not looking at this work

01:41:08.440 --> 01:41:12.640
it's really funny things give me a headache the kid i could you not

01:41:12.640 --> 01:41:14.720
over the graphic

01:41:14.720 --> 01:41:17.800
hey loki what do you think about the exact

01:41:17.800 --> 01:41:19.140
uh... it's so much fun

01:41:19.140 --> 01:41:22.660
and then there's actually what do you think that i think that was the having

01:41:22.660 --> 01:41:24.320
gave them

01:41:24.320 --> 01:41:27.060
okay what do you think about the exact

01:41:27.060 --> 01:41:29.280
uh...

01:41:29.280 --> 01:41:33.680
loki what do you think that you had a picture of me drunk

01:41:33.680 --> 01:41:40.180
September 11th, I'm going to be getting drunk here.

01:41:40.180 --> 01:41:42.200
You're the man now, dog.

01:41:42.200 --> 01:41:43.760
That's what YTMND stands for.

01:41:43.760 --> 01:41:45.920
I think it's something that Randy Jackson said once.

01:41:45.920 --> 01:41:48.160
And by the way, I'm not trying to be mean about anybody.

01:41:48.160 --> 01:41:50.480
I just had to vent for a moment.

01:41:50.480 --> 01:41:52.600
Oh, yeah.

01:41:52.600 --> 01:41:53.880
I made a public correction.

01:41:53.880 --> 01:41:55.240
OK, so September 11th, you're going

01:41:55.240 --> 01:41:56.880
to be drinking because it's your birthday, right?

01:41:56.880 --> 01:41:59.120
So do you have the day after off work or something?

01:41:59.120 --> 01:42:01.640
Yeah, sure, whatever.

01:42:01.640 --> 01:42:10.980
Yeah, I actually had to load that YTMND site in Explorer.

01:42:10.980 --> 01:42:15.440
It doesn't work in Firefox, because Firefox is smart to block those things that repeat

01:42:15.440 --> 01:42:18.680
the sound files over and over and the graphics over and over.

01:42:18.680 --> 01:42:19.680
You know what, though?

01:42:19.680 --> 01:42:26.000
Those things, it's like when they would give those, you know, when they entertain a blonde

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:32.040
It's the same type of stupid things.

01:42:32.040 --> 01:42:37.740
You know, I did see a really, really funny one, though, once, and it was, I don't even

01:42:37.740 --> 01:42:41.700
know if I should repeat this on the air, but it was that screen capture from Mike Tyson's

01:42:41.700 --> 01:42:42.700
Punch Out.

01:42:42.700 --> 01:42:44.580
Remember when you would, like, beat a stage?

01:42:44.580 --> 01:42:48.300
It would show, like, Little Mac in training, and he's running through, like, the streets

01:42:48.300 --> 01:42:53.500
of New York, and it shows his coach, which was this really big, fat, black guy, remember

01:42:53.500 --> 01:42:57.300
that, like, Al Roker used to be, that was on the bike, that was kind of riding in front

01:42:57.300 --> 01:43:06.420
of him, pacing him. And it's, um, it's, nigga stole my bike. This place. And it's just really

01:43:06.420 --> 01:43:09.860
funny because that's not really what's happening in the picture, but then when you look at

01:43:09.860 --> 01:43:14.820
it in that perspective, and it shows a little animation, it kind of looks like it. That

01:43:14.820 --> 01:43:19.020
the guy stole his bike. Those things don't amuse me. That's the funniest one I ever saw.

01:43:19.020 --> 01:43:26.020
I think that those are meant to amuse the easily amused, and I'd say complex amusement.

01:43:26.020 --> 01:43:28.020
I need something with more substance to respond.

01:43:28.020 --> 01:43:34.020
You're a, oh, what do they call those? Like a, you're a, you have snobby humor.

01:43:34.020 --> 01:43:36.020
I can't help it. Well, I did the little humor.

01:43:36.020 --> 01:43:38.020
You're stuck up when it comes to your humor.

01:43:38.020 --> 01:43:42.020
I did the little humor thing in my life journal.

01:43:42.020 --> 01:43:46.020
Anyway, enough about YTMND.

01:43:46.020 --> 01:43:50.020
So yeah,

01:43:50.020 --> 01:43:54.020
I need a non-retarded looking picture. We'll see what we can work out.

01:43:54.020 --> 01:43:58.020
I take retarded looking pictures, so it's kind of tough.

01:43:58.020 --> 01:44:02.020
Maybe if I stop slouching, because when I slouch it looks like my face is like

01:44:02.020 --> 01:44:06.020
exploded. You know what this show needs?

01:44:06.020 --> 01:44:10.020
An enema. No, more cowbell.

01:44:10.020 --> 01:44:13.500
I had to make a Batman reference.

01:44:13.500 --> 01:44:16.220
Have you seen, well Walken was in one of the, uh, um,

01:44:16.220 --> 01:44:17.220
Walken for President!

01:44:17.220 --> 01:44:18.220
I was just going to bring this up.

01:44:18.220 --> 01:44:22.520
This is this big internet site that's been, um, going around the internet, Walken2008.com

01:44:22.520 --> 01:44:23.520
or.org.

01:44:23.520 --> 01:44:24.520
You know what?

01:44:24.520 --> 01:44:25.860
I'm not going to, I'm not going to, uh,

01:44:25.860 --> 01:44:26.860
I'm sure it's fake.

01:44:26.860 --> 01:44:30.940
Yeah, I was pretty sure it's fake, but the thing is, is if, if something like that were

01:44:30.940 --> 01:44:35.460
to pass, first of all, you need to make sure that if they're going to, if somebody's going

01:44:35.460 --> 01:44:38.300
to run for president, put all of the issues up there first and foremost.

01:44:38.300 --> 01:44:41.660
That site was very, very poorly done.

01:44:41.660 --> 01:44:42.660
Very poorly done.

01:44:42.660 --> 01:44:48.180
Well, the domain register or whatever was, like, a Lullerskates or whatever or something.

01:44:48.180 --> 01:44:49.180
Lullerskates.

01:44:49.180 --> 01:44:51.180
So, yeah.

01:44:51.180 --> 01:44:53.580
All right.

01:44:53.580 --> 01:44:57.700
Anyway, I think it's about time we get into the Orange Ons Radio Cage Match.

01:44:57.700 --> 01:44:59.860
How's that sound, kids?

01:44:59.860 --> 01:45:00.860
Sounds terrific.

01:45:00.860 --> 01:45:01.860
Why not?

01:45:01.860 --> 01:45:05.460
Okay, so which song of mine did we use last week that won?

01:45:05.460 --> 01:45:08.020
Whatever the first one you put in there was on the disc.

01:45:08.020 --> 01:45:13.060
I got to remember. I hope, uh, we could just start over. Yeah, I'm in trouble because I

01:45:13.060 --> 01:45:20.060
don't know if I remember which song it was. Do you have any idea what song it was? What

01:45:20.060 --> 01:45:27.060
are my choices? Shit, somebody in chat help us out. I'm sorry, Rob. You didn't like the

01:45:27.060 --> 01:45:32.640
song, I assume. No, because it sounded generic. I'm looking, yeah, I purposely put a generic

01:45:32.640 --> 01:45:38.460
one in there because I knew you'd love those ones um oh this is great we should

01:45:38.460 --> 01:45:44.540
do a cowbell mix was it jet set in the name of love no that wasn't it I did

01:45:44.540 --> 01:45:48.360
that one earlier why don't we start with a challenge

01:45:48.360 --> 01:45:54.100
he's iTunes I seriously don't I seriously don't know what song I had left

01:45:54.100 --> 01:46:00.300
in the cage match so I guess we'll start over fine so we'll start over tonight so

01:46:00.300 --> 01:46:02.600
I gotta find a song and while I find a song

01:46:03.280 --> 01:46:08.520
We're gonna start off with dark soccer stick because it's the only one I have ready to go. So dark soccer

01:46:08.520 --> 01:46:12.120
What did you pick tonight for tonight's kid match? Um, I put in

01:46:12.960 --> 01:46:14.960
it's I put it in the

01:46:15.880 --> 01:46:19.900
Okay, what the afterbirth before might be after first the fortune cookie

01:46:20.280 --> 01:46:25.980
But I couldn't think of anything else than MC Chris is just awesome. So it's MC Chris with geek

01:46:25.980 --> 01:46:32.980
Alright, song number one in tonight's cage match, MC Chris with Geek. Here it is. Enjoy.

01:46:55.980 --> 01:47:01.980
Your beads on the wall, my face, my face on TV

01:47:01.980 --> 01:47:03.980
Make this a piece of pungent odor of a pile holder

01:47:03.980 --> 01:47:05.980
Fan kickers coming 60 clips upon the sonar

01:47:05.980 --> 01:47:08.980
They're gonna fold me over like a chopper keeper folder

01:47:08.980 --> 01:47:10.980
If this is D&D you'd see me jumping to a portal

01:47:10.980 --> 01:47:12.980
I'm a geek, spread G-E-E-K

01:47:12.980 --> 01:47:15.980
I bring my boys in the basement about every day

01:47:15.980 --> 01:47:17.980
A card table, common books, and cans of coke

01:47:17.980 --> 01:47:20.980
But that be blood of another that I saw on shows

01:47:20.980 --> 01:47:21.980
We got style

01:47:21.980 --> 01:47:23.980
Tape on our glasses, sticks on our faces

01:47:23.980 --> 01:47:26.540
All our faces they hit, all our acts are shining shoes

01:47:26.540 --> 01:47:28.460
Bell buckles and pocket protectors

01:47:28.460 --> 01:47:30.460
Straight to our backpacks like my main man Vic

01:47:30.460 --> 01:47:32.060
Once we got problems

01:47:32.060 --> 01:47:33.180
Made me the jocks

01:47:33.180 --> 01:47:35.340
The MTV suckers with cartoons and their cocks

01:47:35.340 --> 01:47:37.660
Otherwise soon as the motherfuckers touch the dick

01:47:37.660 --> 01:47:38.860
If I was Wolverine

01:47:38.860 --> 01:47:40.060
You'd hear my knuckles go stick

01:47:40.060 --> 01:47:41.180
I'm not perfect

01:47:41.180 --> 01:47:42.620
The before picture of Peter Parker

01:47:42.620 --> 01:47:44.300
Always tripping, drop my tray in front of the girl

01:47:44.300 --> 01:47:46.220
But always fuck cuz I got brains

01:47:46.220 --> 01:47:47.260
Fuck B's and C's

01:47:47.260 --> 01:47:49.260
I got a great point average higher than Henderson

01:47:49.260 --> 01:47:52.220
And you see what I'm taking on me

01:47:52.220 --> 01:47:59.220
Because I'm a geek, I'm thanks to you, you're thanks to me

01:47:59.220 --> 01:48:04.220
Well, one day, I'm gonna pack heaps

01:48:04.220 --> 01:48:09.220
Your face on the wall, my face, my face on me

01:48:09.220 --> 01:48:11.220
Don't fuck with the geek, just cause he got a gift

01:48:11.220 --> 01:48:13.220
You get my way, bitch, you get a broken neck pinch

01:48:13.220 --> 01:48:16.220
One night I didn't go to sleep, off playing Risk

01:48:16.220 --> 01:48:18.220
At dawn, I won, got global dominance

01:48:18.220 --> 01:48:21.220
But in the hallway, it's completely different shit

01:48:21.220 --> 01:48:23.380
Can't get my locker open and my pants are always split

01:48:23.380 --> 01:48:25.940
Can't seem to catch a ride, can't ever get a date

01:48:25.940 --> 01:48:28.420
But in my mind, seven to nine things were great

01:48:28.420 --> 01:48:29.460
Crap, night fight!

01:48:29.460 --> 01:48:30.580
Pre-Madonna's prevail

01:48:30.580 --> 01:48:32.980
I'm a homo-sight in lines from the holy grail

01:48:32.980 --> 01:48:35.380
Stuffed nose, extra swollen glands

01:48:35.380 --> 01:48:37.780
Never been kissed, never been on hand

01:48:37.780 --> 01:48:40.740
Just bust my biscuits over Britney in a bubble bath

01:48:40.740 --> 01:48:43.060
Darth Vader within hand-scape full of collabs

01:48:43.060 --> 01:48:45.460
The dragon died from a heart attack

01:48:45.460 --> 01:48:47.780
You may advance and you're up to armor class

01:48:47.780 --> 01:48:49.940
Being a geek, it ain't so bad

01:48:49.940 --> 01:48:52.340
I can't get laid, I got your pantomime stashed

01:48:52.340 --> 01:48:54.740
And I'm mind jam-packed with sci-fi facts

01:48:54.740 --> 01:48:57.140
Ged Nox, rock, dynamite, kick-ass

01:48:57.140 --> 01:48:59.140
Stop banging on me

01:48:59.140 --> 01:49:01.140
Because I love you

01:49:01.140 --> 01:49:04.140
Stop banging on me

01:49:04.140 --> 01:49:06.140
Because I love you

01:49:06.140 --> 01:49:09.140
But I wanna be safe

01:49:09.140 --> 01:49:11.140
I'm gonna pack you

01:49:11.140 --> 01:49:13.140
With my face on the wall

01:49:13.140 --> 01:49:15.140
With my face

01:49:15.140 --> 01:49:17.140
My name's on TV!

01:49:28.340 --> 01:49:30.340
Stop thinking on me

01:49:30.740 --> 01:49:32.740
Because I'm a thief

01:49:33.140 --> 01:49:35.140
I'm straight to you

01:49:35.540 --> 01:49:37.540
You're straight to me

01:49:37.940 --> 01:49:39.940
Well, one day

01:49:40.340 --> 01:49:42.340
I'm gonna pat you

01:49:42.340 --> 01:49:49.340
Your bait's on the wall, my bait, my bait is on TV

01:49:49.340 --> 01:49:56.340
Because I'm a thief, I'm safe to you, you're safe to me

01:49:56.340 --> 01:50:01.340
Well, what do you say? I'm gonna pack it

01:50:01.340 --> 01:50:03.340
Your babe's on the wall

01:50:03.340 --> 01:50:14.380
All right, song number one in tonight's CAGEMASH MC Chris with Geek. Remember you guys will

01:50:14.380 --> 01:50:18.420
be voting for your favorite and then that winner will go into rotation all week long

01:50:18.420 --> 01:50:25.060
on Orange Lounge Radio. But we'll give you our opinions first and try to sway your vote.

01:50:25.060 --> 01:50:27.780
So Dark Sakura, it was your pick, but what did you think?

01:50:27.780 --> 01:50:32.900
It's MC Chris, he gets a 10. Just because that song is like high school for how many

01:50:32.900 --> 01:50:41.420
people ever it's the perfect the perfect description Loki I get the seven I just

01:50:41.420 --> 01:50:49.580
wasn't feeling it I don't know for me MC Chris is kind of one of those folks

01:50:49.580 --> 01:50:54.900
where I think the joke gets old for me I think he's kind of a niche guy I'm

01:50:54.900 --> 01:51:00.380
gonna get the joke I I do sorry I give it a six because it did have a catchy

01:51:00.380 --> 01:51:07.380
I'll give it that. And he doesn't have chicks singing in most of his songs, so that was kind of a neat little addition.

01:51:07.380 --> 01:51:10.380
Alright, moving on. Loki, you wanna go next or you want me to go next?

01:51:10.380 --> 01:51:12.380
Whatever.

01:51:12.380 --> 01:51:14.380
You go next then. What did you pick tonight?

01:51:14.380 --> 01:51:19.380
I picked a song from Wipeout Pure. Hell if I remember what it's called.

01:51:19.380 --> 01:51:23.380
How about, let me give you a hint, it's called Onyx by Cold Storage.

01:51:23.380 --> 01:51:30.220
yeah onyx by cold storage it's the first levels music and it's cool and it's my

01:51:30.220 --> 01:51:36.240
fallback pick because I couldn't find shit oh that's always impressive so yeah

01:51:36.240 --> 01:51:40.420
it's not bad I liked it but yeah whatever all right here we go song

01:51:40.420 --> 01:51:47.420
Point number two, cold storage with Onyx.

01:55:10.420 --> 01:55:11.420
Hey!

01:55:11.420 --> 01:55:12.420
Hey!

01:55:12.420 --> 01:55:13.420
Hey!

01:55:13.420 --> 01:55:14.420
Hey!

01:55:14.420 --> 01:55:15.420
Hey!

01:55:15.420 --> 01:55:16.420
Hey!

01:56:46.420 --> 01:57:14.420
Song number two, Cold Storage with Onyx.

01:57:14.420 --> 01:57:17.420
to see what we thought of that Dark Sakura.

01:57:17.420 --> 01:57:19.420
Generic, five, sorry.

01:57:19.420 --> 01:57:21.420
Loki.

01:57:21.420 --> 01:57:25.420
He gets a nine, because it's better than Empty Chris.

01:57:25.420 --> 01:57:30.420
I also give that song a six, because I found it to be pretty generic as well, I have to say.

01:57:30.420 --> 01:57:33.420
Sorry.

01:57:33.420 --> 01:57:36.420
Alright, let's go to my pick, uh, song number three tonight.

01:57:36.420 --> 01:57:39.420
Since I can't remember what won the cage match two weeks ago...

01:57:39.420 --> 01:57:40.420
Oh, it was something generic, don't worry.

01:57:40.420 --> 01:57:45.100
Yeah, something generic that I would have given a six anyway, so let's just let's just go to a new song

01:57:45.380 --> 01:57:51.660
I'm gonna pick this and I hope that this isn't generic. I actually decided to not do a trance type song tonight

01:57:51.660 --> 01:57:56.820
I'm doing something. There's this band. I absolutely love and a lot of America loves this band, too

01:57:56.820 --> 01:57:59.640
It's Frau Frau and you might remember I used to whore the cage match with these guys

01:58:00.100 --> 01:58:05.480
And they had a big song that was in the movie Garden State called let go and it was really big and stuff

01:58:05.480 --> 01:58:08.920
Well Imogen Heath who's the singer she just recently

01:58:08.920 --> 01:58:14.440
like mortgaged her house so she could self-finance a new album and it's fucking

01:58:14.440 --> 01:58:17.700
great and although a lot of it's really mellow I like this song and I think it

01:58:17.700 --> 01:58:20.980
might work for CAGEMATCH so I'm picking this song it's Imogen Heap and it's

01:58:20.980 --> 01:58:27.980
called I am in love with you. Enjoy!

01:58:50.980 --> 01:58:55.980
I am in love with you, live for the moment

01:58:59.480 --> 01:59:01.980
Right now, another piece

01:59:03.980 --> 01:59:05.980
Right now, another piece

01:59:05.980 --> 01:59:08.980
Just like that, like that

01:59:08.980 --> 01:59:10.980
Another one, babe

01:59:10.980 --> 01:59:13.980
And kiss me for longer

01:59:13.980 --> 01:59:22.980
Oh hey baby, don't you run away Oh hey baby, don't you run away

01:59:22.980 --> 01:59:25.980
Come here and finish what you started

01:59:25.980 --> 01:59:45.980
I am in love with you, baby I am in love with you, yeah

01:59:45.980 --> 01:59:47.980
At least for this moment

01:59:51.980 --> 01:59:54.980
Spit second and it's all in focus

01:59:55.980 --> 01:59:59.980
Spit second and it's all in focus

02:00:00.980 --> 02:00:02.980
Spit second and it's all in focus

02:00:02.980 --> 02:00:05.980
Oh, let this blood dry

02:00:08.980 --> 02:00:11.980
Don't go and get yourself in situations

02:00:11.980 --> 02:00:18.980
Don't go and get yourself in situations only that you can't handle

02:00:18.980 --> 02:00:22.980
Don't forget you

02:00:22.980 --> 02:00:26.980
Don't forget you

02:00:26.980 --> 02:00:31.980
Don't forget you

02:01:01.980 --> 02:01:04.080
I'm not in love with you

02:01:06.240 --> 02:01:09.900
I'm not in love with you baby

02:01:10.700 --> 02:01:13.140
I'm not in love with you

02:01:13.640 --> 02:01:15.560
now I know

02:01:16.400 --> 02:01:19.480
that I feel like I do

02:01:20.740 --> 02:01:24.040
that I feel like I do

02:01:24.040 --> 02:01:40.040
Song number three, Imogen Heap. I am in love with you. Let's see if we were in love with

02:01:40.040 --> 02:01:42.240
that or if we want to break up. Dark Sakura.

02:01:42.240 --> 02:01:50.320
You know, I really like her stuff but it sounded really kind of repetitive. In fact, a lot

02:01:50.320 --> 02:01:57.320
of her stuff sounds the same. It wasn't bad at all, so it gets a 7.5.

02:02:20.320 --> 02:02:21.320
Garbage is cool!

02:02:21.320 --> 02:02:22.320
Yeah, like, garbage is cool!

02:02:22.320 --> 02:02:24.320
No, but, um...

02:02:24.320 --> 02:02:25.320
You know what I mean, though.

02:02:25.320 --> 02:02:27.320
But that particular song is kind of, um...

02:02:27.320 --> 02:02:31.320
It's the more upbeat one, if you could call it that, even though the lyrics are kind of depressing.

02:02:31.320 --> 02:02:33.320
Uh, so I give it an 8.

02:02:33.320 --> 02:02:34.320
Alright!

02:02:34.320 --> 02:02:36.320
Actually, no, I give it a 6.

02:02:36.320 --> 02:02:40.320
So that way, I've given all three songs tonight a 6, and that's 666.

02:02:40.320 --> 02:02:41.320
That would be cool.

02:02:41.320 --> 02:02:42.320
Anyway...

02:02:42.320 --> 02:02:44.320
Yeah, I'm lame. Shut up.

02:02:44.320 --> 02:02:46.320
Let's recap, and then you guys can place your votes.

02:02:46.320 --> 02:02:59.520
song number one you can vote for tonight was MC Chris with geek and song number

02:02:59.520 --> 02:03:04.240
two you can vote for tonight is cold storage onyx

02:03:04.240 --> 02:03:24.840
And song number three tonight, Imogen Heap, I'm In Love With You.

02:03:24.840 --> 02:03:27.160
Okay guys, place vote now.

02:03:27.160 --> 02:03:32.520
Send a private message to Sky with your vote for song number one, song number two, or song

02:03:32.520 --> 02:03:34.220
number three.

02:03:34.220 --> 02:03:41.060
And we will reveal those votes as soon as we have them added all up.

02:03:41.060 --> 02:03:46.440
Loki, this is the part of the show where I'd like to go to you for a sim scene update.

02:03:46.440 --> 02:03:51.180
You know, and normally I'd say I don't have anything, but I actually do, surprisingly

02:03:51.180 --> 02:03:52.180
enough.

02:03:52.180 --> 02:03:58.420
First thing is, Food Mix 2 finally has a goddamn date that's gonna be released, and that goddamn

02:03:58.420 --> 02:04:00.720
date will be September 15th.

02:04:00.720 --> 02:04:03.140
And what can you expect but 50 new songs.

02:04:03.140 --> 02:04:10.140
So that's pretty awesome. So yeah, that'll be something we'll be covering a little bit more a bit later on.

02:04:10.140 --> 02:04:18.140
The other thing is that Tourney Mix 6 Download Pack 1 is available. I have not actually downloaded Download Pack 1, but it's up there.

02:04:18.140 --> 02:04:25.140
So if you go to ddrei.com, you can visit the last of Tourney Mix. I'm sure we're all thankful for that.

02:04:25.140 --> 02:04:30.620
and yeah I think that's pretty much all I had right now I know there's some

02:04:30.620 --> 02:04:38.540
other ones but I can't remember but yeah so food mix 2 that's pretty awesome

02:04:38.540 --> 02:04:46.100
alright super food mix news yeah I'm excited about food mix 2 now see if in

02:04:46.100 --> 02:04:51.420
the groove was like food mix 2 it would be awesome if food mix 2 there's that's

02:04:51.420 --> 02:05:09.420
That's the thing, it's got polish to it. I mean, everything, it looks professional. It looks like if, honestly, if they put it in its own game, if Konami were to, you know, go to the food mix guys and say, hey, make us a game, you know, we'll publish it for you, it would be a DDR game. It would look good.

02:05:09.420 --> 02:05:16.300
I want to mention this because we haven't really gotten a chance to yet.

02:05:16.300 --> 02:05:18.100
Actually, there's a couple things I want to talk about.

02:05:18.100 --> 02:05:20.400
Let's go to this.

02:05:20.400 --> 02:05:24.180
This is a story about the Pump It Up US song list.

02:05:24.180 --> 02:05:27.900
Apparently some folks are actually already getting a hold of this game somehow.

02:05:27.900 --> 02:05:31.260
I think it's because they're in the industry, so they know people that know people.

02:05:31.260 --> 02:05:36.200
But for the rest of us, we get it on the 31st of this month, I want to say, is when Pump

02:05:36.200 --> 02:05:37.200
It Up comes out.

02:05:37.200 --> 02:05:43.000
this 101 songs on the song list freaking crazy right not bad for first yeah not

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:49.040
bad at all just a whole shitload of Banya songs I can't even read all these Banya

02:05:49.040 --> 02:05:52.400
songs there's so damn many but if there's a Banya song you like Mr.

02:05:52.400 --> 02:05:58.360
Larpus, Beethoven's Virus, Turkey March, B like all the big ones they're all

02:05:58.360 --> 02:06:05.920
there you know you want it that's all there also some you know kind of what

02:06:05.920 --> 02:06:12.200
US Known Songs, Name of the Game, Crystal Method, Walkie Talkie Man, Stereogram, I Love

02:06:12.200 --> 02:06:18.520
You Baby, Pandera, Let's Groove, Earth Wind and Fire, Little Less Conversation, the remix

02:06:18.520 --> 02:06:22.000
of the Elvis song, and Rapper's Delight by the Sugarhill Gang.

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:26.000
A lot of those were kind of sort of announced previously, but they are on the official song

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:27.000
list.

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:31.040
Also some K-Pop coming over, which I think is kind of cool.

02:06:31.040 --> 02:06:32.120
Just a whole lot of other songs.

02:06:32.120 --> 02:06:35.120
I'm just kind of scanning through the list, seeing what I can find in here.

02:06:38.120 --> 02:06:41.120
Come to Me and Funky Tonight by Klon, of course, are coming over.

02:06:42.120 --> 02:06:47.120
Empire of the Sun, Novasonic, Boa, Valenti.

02:06:48.120 --> 02:06:50.120
Boa, that's cool.

02:06:50.120 --> 02:06:52.120
Yeah, I thought that was pretty cool too.

02:06:53.120 --> 02:06:56.120
Let's see, what else is on here that I recognize?

02:06:56.120 --> 02:06:58.120
Shake It Up by Rod.

02:06:58.120 --> 02:07:02.580
So you know what guys, just head on over to Beat, or I'm sorry, either BamaniStyle.com

02:07:02.580 --> 02:07:06.740
has the list, or there's actually a thread in the DDR UK forum as well that both have

02:07:06.740 --> 02:07:07.900
the list.

02:07:07.900 --> 02:07:08.900
Check it out.

02:07:08.900 --> 02:07:12.940
I'm actually, you know, even though I said earlier in the show, I actually prefer Integroove

02:07:12.940 --> 02:07:15.860
to Pump It Up because I don't like Pump It Up's interface, I still want to give the home

02:07:15.860 --> 02:07:16.860
version a shot.

02:07:16.860 --> 02:07:17.860
I think it might be fun to play at home.

02:07:17.860 --> 02:07:22.360
And especially with like 101 freaking songs, that's going to be hard to wear out.

02:07:22.360 --> 02:07:25.320
So I definitely will check this game out and let you know what I think.

02:07:25.320 --> 02:07:32.320
I wish I could have gotten an advance copy!

02:07:33.880 --> 02:07:38.180
So, speaking of Pump It Up, we're working on some little extra news we might have on

02:07:38.180 --> 02:07:40.100
that for a little later in the show.

02:07:40.100 --> 02:07:43.360
Also, we've got to talk about DDR with fire.

02:07:43.360 --> 02:07:44.880
Well,

02:07:44.880 --> 02:07:49.280
you know, Dance Dance Emulation, we talked about it a while back, there was going to be a

02:07:49.280 --> 02:07:50.760
Burning Man in this

02:07:50.760 --> 02:07:52.960
fire festival that's in Oakland.

02:07:52.960 --> 02:07:59.960
I was just about to get to this, yes. I've been teasing it like the whole show, and now I'm finally getting to it, but that's alright.

02:07:59.960 --> 02:08:10.960
It looks awesome, from what I've seen gameplay-wise. They had a lot of hardware trouble, though, because I guess the pads broke, the thing crashed, all that type of thing.

02:08:10.960 --> 02:08:14.960
But I got to see there's a little bit of footage on the website, actually, that shows...

02:08:14.960 --> 02:08:26.960
Yes, actually DDRFreak posted a video about this and I wanted to show this, if I could get to it, so we could have a little bit of movie nights.

02:08:26.960 --> 02:08:34.960
And now, oh darn it, I can't find the video. I can bring it up again real fast here. So you actually watched the video, Loki, of this?

02:08:34.960 --> 02:08:35.960
Yes.

02:08:35.960 --> 02:08:36.960
And what did you think?

02:08:36.960 --> 02:08:54.960
That was interesting. The guy in the suit reminded me of the Bunnyman from the Intel commercials, but it was an interesting idea. I don't know, it's just one of those Burning Man things, because they've got a lot of weird things that they do at Burning Man, and that would be one of them, so.

02:08:54.960 --> 02:08:57.960
You crazy kids. It looks interesting.

02:08:57.960 --> 02:08:59.960
Yeah.

02:08:59.960 --> 02:09:03.960
Let me see, let me see, because JB, you probably haven't seen this yet, right?

02:09:03.960 --> 02:09:04.960
Probably not.

02:09:04.960 --> 02:09:05.960
Let me show this to you here.

02:09:05.960 --> 02:09:06.960
I can't see through you.

02:09:06.960 --> 02:09:08.960
Hold on, I'm gonna move. I just gotta open this up first.

02:09:08.960 --> 02:09:09.960
Okay, here it comes.

02:09:11.960 --> 02:09:13.960
Oh, wait, we need some music. We need some music. Hold on.

02:09:13.960 --> 02:09:14.960
Oh, yeah, I have.

02:09:14.960 --> 02:09:15.960
Did you? Oh, here it is again.

02:09:19.960 --> 02:09:21.960
Play a little after the game of love.

02:09:21.960 --> 02:09:22.960
Then...

02:09:22.960 --> 02:09:23.960
Whoosh! Fire!

02:09:25.960 --> 02:09:26.960
Whoosh! Fire!

02:09:27.960 --> 02:09:29.960
Yep, that's pretty much, uh, dance simulation.

02:09:29.960 --> 02:09:30.960
Whoosh! Fire!

02:09:31.960 --> 02:09:32.960
Hey, fire in the spring.

02:09:32.960 --> 02:09:39.960
DDR whoosh fire mix.

02:09:41.040 --> 02:09:44.400
I'll say it. What a stupid idea.

02:09:44.400 --> 02:09:45.640
I'm sorry.

02:09:45.640 --> 02:09:50.280
Now if you really caught on fire and was dancing on fire, that might be cool.

02:09:50.280 --> 02:09:54.440
This is somebody's inside joke gone like way, way, way too far.

02:09:54.440 --> 02:09:59.280
I'm just waiting for someone to put themselves on fire because they saw them

02:09:59.280 --> 02:10:04.000
I love it because on the DDR Freak story it says, you know, it links to the article and

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:09.960
everything and it says, note, we urge you not to try this at home, you know, like, you

02:10:09.960 --> 02:10:14.160
know what, don't even put the disclaimer, let somebody try it at home, that's Darwinism,

02:10:14.160 --> 02:10:15.160
kids.

02:10:15.160 --> 02:10:16.160
No, it's all good.

02:10:16.160 --> 02:10:22.440
You know what, I want someone to try it at home so I can submit their story to the Darwin

02:10:22.440 --> 02:10:24.880
Awards.

02:10:24.880 --> 02:10:29.800
I don't get it because everybody's talking about this sensation of being blasted with

02:10:29.800 --> 02:10:33.240
fire and all this stuff, you know, well you can feel the sensation of being blasted with

02:10:33.240 --> 02:10:34.240
fire.

02:10:34.240 --> 02:10:37.800
Okay, A, if you want to feel the sensation of being blasted with fire, become a firefighter.

02:10:37.800 --> 02:10:43.240
B, if that's not for you or whatever, because you're wearing all these protective gear,

02:10:43.240 --> 02:10:46.800
I mean I understand that there's that heat sensation or something, and I'm just knocking

02:10:46.800 --> 02:10:49.440
on this I guess because it's not something I would ever really want to do.

02:10:49.440 --> 02:10:51.000
I'm just not interested in it.

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:56.200
I'm also not you know I just like I don't really want to visit central

02:10:56.200 --> 02:11:00.200
Mexico so I'm not going to do it ever I don't really want to play pool yes in

02:11:00.200 --> 02:11:04.760
the way go out and get laid there are more things better than fire being

02:11:04.760 --> 02:11:13.000
blasted in your face like a good woman go get laid honestly that that's what I

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:17.640
needed a woman co-design this game I think some prostitutes are cheaper than

02:11:17.640 --> 02:11:21.640
I'm surprised the whole set up didn't blow up then.

02:11:21.640 --> 02:11:25.640
Whoa! Whoa! Did you hear that joke you just made?

02:11:25.640 --> 02:11:28.640
Excuse me? Repeat myself?

02:11:28.640 --> 02:11:30.640
You should have listened in the first place.

02:11:30.640 --> 02:11:32.640
No! No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

02:11:32.640 --> 02:11:38.640
If you want to hear that joke, you can tune into the rewinds that we have on DVR Freak for Yield.

02:11:38.640 --> 02:11:44.640
No, no. We would be able to listen to it if someone would remember to upload it to DVR Freak's server.

02:11:44.640 --> 02:11:49.040
I've been out a couple weeks, and we will get back in the swing of those very soon, so...

02:11:49.040 --> 02:11:50.800
I think they're playing one from a month ago.

02:11:50.800 --> 02:11:51.440
Yeah.

02:11:51.440 --> 02:11:52.840
We'll be back in the swing of those.

02:11:52.840 --> 02:11:56.400
It's almost the same show every week anyway.

02:11:56.400 --> 02:11:58.320
No, nothing else is going on.

02:11:58.320 --> 02:12:00.920
I'm gonna go ahead and repeat the joke because it wasn't my joke,

02:12:00.920 --> 02:12:04.720
so I won't get in trouble for it, but I said, did the woman co-write it?

02:12:04.720 --> 02:12:10.800
And then he said, well, I'm surprised that the whole thing isn't broken.

02:12:10.800 --> 02:12:13.600
Actually, I said I'm surprised the whole thing didn't blow up.

02:12:13.600 --> 02:12:14.600
Oh, sorry.

02:12:15.900 --> 02:12:18.000
I'm going to strangle you with the mic cord now.

02:12:19.600 --> 02:12:21.400
From now on, Loki will be a ghost.

02:12:21.400 --> 02:12:23.100
He will be here in spirit only.

02:12:24.100 --> 02:12:25.200
When I get around to it.

02:12:27.700 --> 02:12:29.400
Anyways, no.

02:12:30.300 --> 02:12:33.000
But see, at Burning Man, if it blew up, it'd be good.

02:12:33.700 --> 02:12:34.200
I don't know.

02:12:35.100 --> 02:12:36.100
Oh, man.

02:12:36.600 --> 02:12:37.200
Why?

02:12:38.100 --> 02:12:38.600
Hmm.

02:12:39.100 --> 02:12:39.600
Why?

02:12:39.800 --> 02:12:40.300
I don't know.

02:12:40.300 --> 02:12:47.740
I just, I don't feel like you're really feeling the sensation of fire because you're wearing

02:12:47.740 --> 02:12:52.940
a protective suit all over, so it's like it kind of takes away from that, it's like, feel

02:12:52.940 --> 02:12:58.480
like what it's like to get shot, here's a bulletproof vest, you know?

02:12:58.480 --> 02:13:03.020
And you know somebody's going to come up with this, like, dance, dance, you know, south

02:13:03.020 --> 02:13:07.660
central where you've got to dodge the bullets that get shot at you if you miss a step.

02:13:07.660 --> 02:13:10.660
I feel what it's like to get married and get kicked in the nuts.

02:13:14.660 --> 02:13:15.660
I don't appreciate that.

02:13:15.660 --> 02:13:17.660
Yeah, you two are the ones getting married in this next year.

02:13:17.660 --> 02:13:19.660
I'm not, so whatever.

02:13:19.660 --> 02:13:21.660
Alright.

02:13:23.660 --> 02:13:25.660
We're going to go to a break.

02:13:25.660 --> 02:13:27.660
When we come back from the break, more stuff.

02:13:27.660 --> 02:13:29.660
Also, tonight's cage match winner,

02:13:29.660 --> 02:13:31.660
I haven't even started looking at the votes yet,

02:13:31.660 --> 02:13:35.660
so we'll get to all that when we come back after a quick break.

02:13:35.660 --> 02:13:39.300
and I think I have the appropriate song to start us off this break

02:13:39.300 --> 02:13:43.300
So we'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.

02:14:09.300 --> 02:14:16.300
You've had the time to rest, which is coming to an end, and we start again.

02:14:39.300 --> 02:14:41.300
You gotta give them CX a wish, you gotta let them go

02:14:41.300 --> 02:14:43.300
One, two, three, fire!

02:15:41.300 --> 02:16:03.040
I'd be here, I'd be here, I'd be here every day

02:16:03.040 --> 02:16:07.040
I feel you, I feel you, I feel you everywhere

02:16:07.040 --> 02:16:12.300
I feel you, I feel you, I say to you every day

02:16:12.320 --> 02:16:14.660
I feel you, I feel you, I feel I'm anywhere now

02:16:14.660 --> 02:16:18.360
I feel you, I feel you, I say to you everywhere all day

02:16:18.360 --> 02:16:22.440
I feel you, I feel you, I feel you everywhere day

02:16:22.440 --> 02:16:26.200
I feel you, I feel you, I say to you everywhere

02:16:26.200 --> 02:16:30.060
I feel you, I feel you, I feel I'm anywhere now

02:16:30.060 --> 02:16:34.060
I feel, I feel, I feel like I'm falling

02:16:49.060 --> 02:16:53.060
I feel, I feel, I feel like I'm waiting

02:16:53.060 --> 02:16:57.060
I feel, I feel, I say to you every day

02:16:57.060 --> 02:17:19.460
Happy New Year!

02:17:57.060 --> 02:18:08.600
oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh oh.

02:18:08.600 --> 02:18:14.080
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh.

02:18:14.080 --> 02:18:17.380
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

02:18:17.380 --> 02:18:20.380
I'm leaving you.

02:18:20.380 --> 02:18:26.380
There's little love to find.

02:18:26.380 --> 02:18:31.260
where my heart belongs.

02:18:31.260 --> 02:18:38.380
I'm living through the midst of love

02:18:38.380 --> 02:18:46.380
through by the day my heart belongs.

02:18:46.380 --> 02:18:52.380
Living through the midst of love

02:18:52.380 --> 02:18:59.380
To find a place my heart belongs

02:18:59.380 --> 02:19:06.380
I'm living through the fear of love

02:19:06.380 --> 02:19:17.380
To find the place where my heart belongs

02:21:06.380 --> 02:21:10.380
Orange Lounge Radio, Bahmani Music, and more.

02:21:10.380 --> 02:21:17.700
Howdy kids, welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, and in that break you heard some fire

02:21:17.700 --> 02:21:25.220
from Disney's Rave, Happy Wedding from 2DX7 style, Lion Musashi with Thunder from 2DX8,

02:21:25.220 --> 02:21:31.780
and DJ Doc with Pump It Up, I'm sorry, with Run To You from Pump It Up, I read it backwards,

02:21:31.780 --> 02:21:32.780
sorry.

02:21:32.780 --> 02:21:40.780
You wanna know what's funny? We did that at karaoke on the E3 trip.

02:21:40.780 --> 02:21:41.780
What?

02:21:41.780 --> 02:21:46.780
On the DDR Frank Moderator. Run to you, because we went to a Korean karaoke bar.

02:21:46.780 --> 02:21:51.780
Oh, you went to a Korean karaoke bar. I remember the Korean arcade at Cyberbeat, but you didn't

02:21:51.780 --> 02:21:52.780
go to Cyberbeat, did you?

02:21:52.780 --> 02:21:59.780
No, but we went to a Korean karaoke place. And actually, I did a song off the Japanese

02:21:59.780 --> 02:22:02.780
but it was only English, it was a bulla.

02:22:02.780 --> 02:22:03.780
Ah.

02:22:03.780 --> 02:22:09.620
I cannot forget at the Korean arcade, the cyber zone, I think it's called, I hope it's

02:22:09.620 --> 02:22:13.020
still around, it was a cute little place, where they were having this tournament, they

02:22:13.020 --> 02:22:16.060
had karaoke boost in the back, but it was the kind of thing where you'd lock yourself

02:22:16.060 --> 02:22:19.580
in and you'd put in a couple tokens and you could sing a song, and I swear to God, Rice

02:22:19.580 --> 02:22:22.840
Princess and I were in there the entire tournament, we probably missed the whole tournament thanks

02:22:22.840 --> 02:22:24.100
to those karaoke rooms.

02:22:24.100 --> 02:22:27.500
I was singing Cyndi Lauper, and I was singing, you know, just everything, everything.

02:22:27.500 --> 02:22:31.620
it was fine. And it would grade you when you were done, which I thought was kind of weird.

02:22:31.620 --> 02:22:35.860
Well, yeah, but that's like almost typical of just about every other karaoke thing I've

02:22:35.860 --> 02:22:38.980
done except for the ones like where we normally go to karaoke.

02:22:38.980 --> 02:22:44.660
Yeah. Anyway, I actually wanted to mention something about Pump It Up. We actually have

02:22:44.660 --> 02:22:51.140
a little bit of an exclusive here. So we have a tip from our buddy Maple, and Maple, he's

02:22:51.140 --> 02:22:57.460
sharing this with us so that we can tell you guys that Banya with a song, and I'm gonna

02:22:57.460 --> 02:22:59.900
I'm gonna fuck up the pronunciation of this.

02:22:59.900 --> 02:23:04.900
Niceance, N-A-I-S-S-A-N-C-E, Niceance, Niceance, I don't know.

02:23:05.580 --> 02:23:06.420
Niceance.

02:23:06.420 --> 02:23:07.580
Niceance.

02:23:07.580 --> 02:23:12.020
This song will actually be unlocked in survival mode.

02:23:12.020 --> 02:23:15.180
In Pump It Up, so that's not on any of the song lists

02:23:15.180 --> 02:23:18.740
that are already out there, so go figure.

02:23:18.740 --> 02:23:20.460
If you didn't know, the way that Pump It Up,

02:23:20.460 --> 02:23:22.820
the home version works, it's got like different modes.

02:23:22.820 --> 02:23:25.460
Home mode has no life bars in it.

02:23:25.460 --> 02:23:31.440
The arcade mode is like the arcade, but survival mode, when your life bar runs out, you lose.

02:23:31.440 --> 02:23:34.720
So there's these different modes you can play that kind of alter the life mode, and by playing

02:23:34.720 --> 02:23:36.820
the right way, you will get this new Bonnie song.

02:23:36.820 --> 02:23:42.220
You know what, if I was any good at Pump It Up, I think I would dig the one that doesn't

02:23:42.220 --> 02:23:43.220
have a life bar.

02:23:43.220 --> 02:23:44.220
Yeah.

02:23:44.220 --> 02:23:48.260
I'm gonna, um, I'm gonna, uh, pick up this game.

02:23:48.260 --> 02:23:53.380
Even though I'm not, like, huge on Pump It Up, I just think such diversity in the game.

02:23:53.380 --> 02:23:57.380
I'm hopeful, even though Mad Catz is publishing it, I'm very hopeful about the game.

02:23:57.380 --> 02:24:01.380
It looks like it's going to be pretty good, so I'm definitely going to pick it up.

02:24:01.380 --> 02:24:05.380
Naysons is how you pronounce that, by the way. Thank you, kids in chat.

02:24:05.380 --> 02:24:10.380
Look soon to our site. We're going to have some videos of this game in progress.

02:24:10.380 --> 02:24:17.380
So, we'll have that sometime in the next week. So, those of you guys looking forward to, pump it up in the U.S.

02:24:17.380 --> 02:24:20.380
Something else I wanted to share with you guys, an anonymous tip from the chat room.

02:24:20.380 --> 02:24:24.400
not so much an anonymous tip, actually. This came to us from, I believe Dark Knight sent

02:24:24.400 --> 02:24:29.720
this over to me, and if I mess that up, I'm very sorry. This is a link on IGN.com, actually,

02:24:29.720 --> 02:24:37.000
that talks about a preview for a new Nintendo DS music game from the people that made Guitar

02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:45.240
Man. Osutake Oondan. Let me see, let me think of it. Excuse me, it's in the laptop. Yeah,

02:24:45.240 --> 02:24:47.240
Yeah, I saw that one. It's weird-looking.

02:24:47.240 --> 02:24:49.240
Well, how so, Loki?

02:24:49.240 --> 02:24:51.240
Um, it looks like...

02:24:51.240 --> 02:24:53.240
Tatakai...Tatakai means fight.

02:24:53.240 --> 02:24:58.240
Um, Olendan, I'm not quite sure, but it means, hey, fight something.

02:24:58.240 --> 02:24:59.240
Alright.

02:24:59.240 --> 02:25:03.240
It looked funny because there's like these three guys dancing and stuff,

02:25:03.240 --> 02:25:07.240
and there's this guy that looks like yelling at them, and I don't really know what that was.

02:25:07.240 --> 02:25:10.240
I was just based off the pictures that I saw in there.

02:25:10.240 --> 02:25:12.240
Hmm interesting

02:25:12.280 --> 02:25:20.800
Basically, it involves three like soldier type guys that are going around and around the town and they they motivate people with manly poses

02:25:20.800 --> 02:25:26.020
but it's up to the player to control just how well that they can motivate so it's kind of like a

02:25:26.440 --> 02:25:30.360
Follow the pattern type challenge and it matches the beat of the song that's being played of course

02:25:31.040 --> 02:25:37.120
Using the touchscreen. Oh, why am I thinking of like the super sentai pose?

02:25:37.120 --> 02:25:41.520
those things that they do for every time they speak.

02:25:41.520 --> 02:25:45.120
During the song, a series of numbered circles pop up on screen as the player's tasked to

02:25:45.120 --> 02:25:47.840
tap the circle to the rhythm of the song.

02:25:47.840 --> 02:25:51.760
Now the game offers a little bit of help by providing a ring around each circle as they

02:25:51.760 --> 02:25:56.400
appear, and when the ring matches the circumference of the beat circle, that's the exact moment

02:25:56.400 --> 02:25:57.600
it needs to be tapped.

02:25:57.600 --> 02:26:01.320
I think Technic Beat kind of does something a little similar there, so...

02:26:01.320 --> 02:26:03.080
Technic Beat is confusing.

02:26:03.080 --> 02:26:06.560
Yeah, but this song sounds like it's just the tap on the right circle, so that should

02:26:06.560 --> 02:26:11.800
be interesting there. But that's not it. There's also pathways in the game where you

02:26:11.800 --> 02:26:17.160
don't just tap. They're a little bit longer of a beat. You have to tap and drag your stylus

02:26:17.160 --> 02:26:23.040
to the beat. It's like a virtual volleyball, one end of the path to another and back again.

02:26:23.040 --> 02:26:27.000
So that's kind of the guitar man-ish part of it. That should be very interesting.

02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:32.720
Rob, say that last word for me. O-U-E-N-D-A-N. O-U-E-N-D-A-N, yes.

02:26:32.720 --> 02:26:34.120
Okay, I'm gonna see what that means.

02:26:34.120 --> 02:26:35.120
Alright.

02:26:35.120 --> 02:26:37.120
Okay.

02:26:37.120 --> 02:26:40.620
Alright, uh, let's get to tonight's cage match winner, boys and girls.

02:26:40.620 --> 02:26:42.120
I know you've been waiting a while to hear it.

02:26:42.120 --> 02:26:45.420
Tonight's cage match winner was won by one vote.

02:26:45.420 --> 02:26:48.220
And I have to say tonight, kids, not a lot of votes tonight.

02:26:48.220 --> 02:26:51.020
I'm very pissed at your apathy.

02:26:51.020 --> 02:26:52.720
But for those of you guys that did vote, thank you.

02:26:52.720 --> 02:26:53.720
They're being too emo.

02:26:53.720 --> 02:26:54.720
Yeah, I guess so.

02:26:54.720 --> 02:26:57.220
Maybe they were too wrapped up in the, uh, emo chick song.

02:26:57.220 --> 02:26:59.020
Unfortunately, that's not the song that won tonight.

02:26:59.020 --> 02:27:02.220
The song that won tonight was...

02:27:02.220 --> 02:27:07.220
Onyx by Cold Storage with one vote over MC Chris.

02:27:07.220 --> 02:27:08.220
Sadness.

02:27:08.220 --> 02:27:10.220
Hooray for generic.

02:27:10.220 --> 02:27:13.220
He had on the picket song next week.

02:27:13.220 --> 02:27:16.220
Rub it in. Rub it in.

02:27:16.220 --> 02:27:21.220
To those of you guys who didn't vote, poop on you.

02:27:21.220 --> 02:27:27.220
I think going into that, though, I think that it's highly appropriate to have, you know...

02:27:27.220 --> 02:27:29.220
Oh, some ranting time?

02:27:29.220 --> 02:27:30.220
Yes, some ranting time.

02:27:30.220 --> 02:27:41.220
I agree. I'm ready to be pissed off. I'm ready to do a little ranting. So Chat Room, if you're ready to do some ranting too, it's that time of the show, boys and girls, where we get into the FUs of the week.

02:27:41.220 --> 02:27:49.220
Now, you know what's interesting, DarkSakura? I know you put this in the pre-show folder, and I know you didn't intend for this to be your new FU theme.

02:27:49.220 --> 02:27:51.220
What?

02:27:51.220 --> 02:27:54.220
I've not put that in there for you since you never seem to be able to find it.

02:27:54.220 --> 02:27:55.220
Thank you. I appreciate that.

02:27:55.220 --> 02:27:57.220
We're going to have to do this next week.

02:27:57.220 --> 02:28:02.220
I have some funny music that you can use for game show stuff.

02:28:02.220 --> 02:28:04.220
I put it on my card, especially for you guys.

02:28:04.220 --> 02:28:06.220
I'm sorry, this isn't about ranting.

02:28:06.220 --> 02:28:08.220
But it's funny!

02:28:08.220 --> 02:28:11.220
I want that as my F.U. music because it's so weird.

02:28:11.220 --> 02:28:12.220
Well, you get Menomina on one.

02:28:12.220 --> 02:28:13.220
By the way.

02:28:13.220 --> 02:28:14.220
Oh, fine.

02:28:14.220 --> 02:28:17.220
Olendan means something to the effect of cheering party.

02:28:17.220 --> 02:28:19.220
Or cheering gang or posing gang.

02:28:19.220 --> 02:28:22.220
Well, that makes sense if they're like a motivational group that runs around.

02:28:22.220 --> 02:28:25.220
Yeah, so it's like, hey, fight! Cheering party!

02:28:25.220 --> 02:28:26.220
Okay.

02:28:26.220 --> 02:28:30.220
Fight, kill, blood makes grass grow. Fight, kill, blood makes grass grow.

02:28:30.220 --> 02:28:36.220
Actually, that used to be our homecoming chant every year because our, uh, rival school for homecoming was McGill.

02:28:36.220 --> 02:28:39.220
So it was kill McGill, blood makes the grass grow.

02:28:39.220 --> 02:28:42.220
This used to be our cheer.

02:28:42.220 --> 02:28:45.220
And this kind of ties into the next segment here, so I'll kick it off with a little cheer.

02:28:45.220 --> 02:28:47.220
I'm gonna kick off tonight's FUs with a little cheer.

02:28:47.220 --> 02:28:48.220
You're gonna be our cheerleader!

02:28:48.220 --> 02:28:49.220
Yes, I am. Okay, ready?

02:28:49.220 --> 02:28:50.220
Has it already been brought in?

02:28:50.220 --> 02:28:57.560
yes so I'm broadening it right now okay give me a cue cue give me a cue cue give

02:28:57.560 --> 02:29:04.880

02:29:10.200 --> 02:29:17.640
that spell 3b you're retarded why are we doing this why was the band here okay

02:29:17.640 --> 02:29:20.640
Okay, why are we doing the 4Q of the week?

02:29:20.640 --> 02:29:23.640
Because we're full of emo.

02:29:31.640 --> 02:29:35.640
My first F.U. goes to people who like generic crap.

02:29:35.640 --> 02:29:45.080
My second F.U. of the week goes towards just being given random assignments at work and

02:29:45.080 --> 02:29:50.040
then having to go back and do everybody else's stuff because certain people decided not to

02:29:50.040 --> 02:29:55.120
come into work that day and aren't going to be in the next week, so I get to do it again.

02:29:55.120 --> 02:29:56.120
Yay!

02:29:56.120 --> 02:30:03.720
F.U. goes toward having to basically do a lot of the wedding crap on my own, although

02:30:03.720 --> 02:30:08.040
I've been getting a bit more support as of late. Well, it's not really that I'm doing

02:30:08.040 --> 02:30:11.320
it on my own, it's just that there's certain things about it that are more important to

02:30:11.320 --> 02:30:16.200
me than they are to the other party in my wedding.

02:30:16.200 --> 02:30:18.440
You guys should do a reality show about my wedding.

02:30:18.440 --> 02:30:28.440
No! Hell no, okay? Hell no. This is close enough to reality. More like unreality. Another

02:30:58.440 --> 02:31:07.680
much longer to wait. Something for the podcast, sorry. I just had a tiny little fanboy orgasm

02:31:07.680 --> 02:31:14.840
though. F.U. goes to Loki for showing Rob Krabs you're my F.U. Excuse me, it's my moment,

02:31:14.840 --> 02:31:23.560
okay. Animal Crossing DS needs to be out like now. Dude, when's that supposed to be out?

02:31:23.560 --> 02:31:24.560
November.

02:31:24.560 --> 02:31:25.560
Haha.

02:31:25.560 --> 02:31:26.560
Aww, fuck them.

02:31:26.560 --> 02:31:36.280
F you to not being able to register for my wedding because, you know, I want to register

02:31:36.280 --> 02:31:40.840
and all this because, you know, I don't care what people say about, you know, don't send

02:31:40.840 --> 02:31:41.840
me gifts.

02:31:41.840 --> 02:31:45.520
When you get married, people feel obligated to give you a present, you know, it's just

02:31:45.520 --> 02:31:46.520
how things are.

02:31:46.520 --> 02:31:50.960
So, I want Amazon gift certificates and that's it.

02:31:50.960 --> 02:31:53.080
How many toasters do you want, seriously?

02:31:53.080 --> 02:31:54.080
You don't eat bread.

02:31:54.080 --> 02:31:55.080
Exactly.

02:31:55.080 --> 02:31:57.080
I don't fucking need a toaster.

02:31:57.080 --> 02:31:58.080
So, yeah.

02:31:58.080 --> 02:32:03.800
Um, as to the traditional ideas of having to give people, like, household goods for

02:32:03.800 --> 02:32:05.880
their wedding, just give me an Amazon gift certificate.

02:32:05.880 --> 02:32:06.880
I'll be happy.

02:32:06.880 --> 02:32:08.880
Um, that's it.

02:32:08.880 --> 02:32:09.880
Alright.

02:32:09.880 --> 02:32:14.740
Let Dark Sakura save up so she can buy many copies of the Kama Sutra.

02:32:14.740 --> 02:32:15.740
I don't need that.

02:32:15.740 --> 02:32:18.900
Oh, why would she need many copies of it?

02:32:18.900 --> 02:32:21.220
You know, just to have in various rooms at the house.

02:32:21.220 --> 02:32:23.220
Loki's turn.

02:32:51.220 --> 02:32:57.220
Teacopter 2, which was a waste of my time. Don't import that game, ever. It looks strange, but not strange enough.

02:32:57.220 --> 02:33:06.220
And, um, yeah, and also fuck you too, that stupid, um, Jack, whatever his name is. I don't even want to, you know.

02:33:06.220 --> 02:33:07.220
Jack Thompson?

02:33:07.220 --> 02:33:08.220
Jack Thompson!

02:33:08.220 --> 02:33:09.220
The idiot?

02:33:09.220 --> 02:33:10.220
Eh, friggin' idiot.

02:33:10.220 --> 02:33:13.220
Oh, no, no, no. I'm gonna bring up later on about VGCats.

02:33:13.220 --> 02:33:23.220
But he, you know, he just has to go out there and just, you know, perpetuate the let's not blame the parents for our kids' problems, let's blame someone else stereotype.

02:33:23.220 --> 02:33:32.220
So anyways, to hell with him. I hope he dies. In some ironic way that has to do with video games. I'm done.

02:33:32.220 --> 02:33:43.220
kostjamrh And FU'd a Nintendo for not having Animal Crossing DS out like now.

02:34:02.220 --> 02:34:06.220
But my aim's improving.

02:34:06.220 --> 02:34:10.220
You owe me rent on that, you know?

02:34:10.220 --> 02:34:14.220
I used to have that bumper sticker on my car like years ago when I really hated my ex. We're friends now.

02:34:14.220 --> 02:34:18.220
Anyway, none of that matters.

02:34:18.220 --> 02:34:22.220
I don't know, just a nephew to the fact that I'm

02:34:22.220 --> 02:34:26.220
a nephew to the fact that I've got a lot of drama going on

02:34:26.220 --> 02:34:30.220
in other places that don't have to do with the show or anything, but I can't really

02:34:30.220 --> 02:34:40.140
on air either so just nephew to all that drama going on there um and an fu2 um an fu2 um

02:34:40.140 --> 02:34:43.640

Find it to download to the Mighty Mosh and Emo Rangers theme.

02:35:24.560 --> 02:35:27.300
And I heard it's going to jump to $3 tomorrow or the next day.

02:35:27.300 --> 02:35:30.240
Do I have a justifiable reason for not wanting to drive now?

02:35:30.240 --> 02:35:35.380
Fuck cage match 2 and I want a copy of Geek now.

02:35:35.380 --> 02:35:39.780
Legend of Zaku says F you to the Iraqi insurgent who capped one of my school's student-soldier

02:35:39.780 --> 02:35:41.340
to death last Sunday.

02:35:41.340 --> 02:35:44.400
And F you to President Bush for making that situation possible.

02:35:44.400 --> 02:35:47.300
F you to all the thunderstorms we've been having tonight, thus taking out the power

02:35:47.300 --> 02:35:48.680
in my house for a little bit.

02:35:48.680 --> 02:35:52.560
And F you to my cable provider Cablevision for providing shitty digital cable that gives

02:35:52.560 --> 02:35:59.400
channels with piss-poor lag and pixelation. Tomo-kun says fuck my iTunes library for corrupting

02:35:59.400 --> 02:36:05.080
itself and all but one song not recovering. The acapella to feel good Inc. was the song

02:36:05.080 --> 02:36:11.560
that got saved. You saved it? Send that to me please. Chamara says F you to not having

02:36:11.560 --> 02:36:19.440
enough money to buy cool stuff like ATHF DVDs and Napalm. Sacarina says F you to Jack Thompson

02:36:19.440 --> 02:36:25.920
for being the biggest fucktard on earth and causing havoc worldwide.

02:36:25.920 --> 02:36:29.880
Dark Knight says my F.U. goes to my job for driving me insane, another to being broke

02:36:29.880 --> 02:36:36.040
and finally to gas prices, this has gone too damn far.

02:36:36.040 --> 02:36:41.000
Dirty Thief says F.U. to my damn boss for giving me six extra hours of work, F.U. to

02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:45.880
traffic thunderstorms and other shit that ruins my Sunday night including these damn

02:36:45.880 --> 02:36:50.820
electronic shit and and f you to damn wet streets nearly making me hit a poor

02:36:50.820 --> 02:36:54.560
dog fuck that my friend almost hit a cat the other night when we were driving in

02:36:54.560 --> 02:36:57.640
Pennsylvania oh it's the saddest thing ever and he almost had a heart attack

02:36:57.640 --> 02:37:02.480
don't don't hit animals on the road didn't try hard enough dark Tetsuya

02:37:02.480 --> 02:37:06.660

better to do oh and Tomo kun says no the one that didn't get saved I screwed up

02:37:14.480 --> 02:37:21.480
I'm being assisted with that and I will be happy to share.

02:37:44.480 --> 02:37:48.920
large contingent from some site? A few of the people from the Gorillaz unofficial chats

02:37:48.920 --> 02:37:55.160
listening in. Hi guys! Super! Thank you for listening in. We have Bexar and Ross and I'm

02:37:55.160 --> 02:37:59.360
trying to remember who else is listening but if I don't remember, hi! You get a big shout

02:37:59.360 --> 02:38:06.200
out from me. We like it when new people listen. I'm going to tip the orange lounge hat by

02:38:06.200 --> 02:38:12.540
just giving a little nod with the song here. We'll dance like they do in the iPod commercials

02:38:12.540 --> 02:38:16.540
here with the shadows and everything. I'd rather not dance like they do in the iPad commercial.

02:38:16.540 --> 02:38:20.540
Ooh, you can just keep playing this for me.

02:38:20.540 --> 02:38:24.540
Okay, that's all you get. Sorry.

02:38:24.540 --> 02:38:28.540
You know what, though, that makes me think of this. I saw

02:38:28.540 --> 02:38:32.540
this in the... I was randomly having lunch in Phoenix yesterday, right?

02:38:32.540 --> 02:38:36.540
Jason took me to this Chinese restaurant, and we were watching commercials

02:38:36.540 --> 02:38:40.540
on TV, and I saw this one that looked like it was parodying

02:38:40.540 --> 02:38:45.720
that commercial with the Feel Good Inc. and the iPod Shadow Dancers, right?

02:38:45.720 --> 02:38:50.200
But it was children doing the shadow dancing, and we were like, what the hell is this?

02:38:50.200 --> 02:38:54.820
And it turns out it was actually for like a Kidz Bop CD, but no, it gets better.

02:38:54.820 --> 02:38:59.860
It was actually an all Christian Kidz Bop version.

02:38:59.860 --> 02:39:03.860
I don't remember what it was called, it's like, wow, wow, that's inspiration or something

02:39:03.860 --> 02:39:05.660
like that, Kidz Inspiration or something.

02:39:05.660 --> 02:39:12.660
It was, it was Kidz Bop, but all God music, and it was Jesus telling you to copy, or to

02:39:13.860 --> 02:39:17.180
copyright infringement. Yes, I thought Thou Shalt Not Steal was one

02:39:17.180 --> 02:39:23.340
of the, uh, Thou Shalt Not Steal copyrights. You know, we need to actually check the original

02:39:23.340 --> 02:39:28.340
translation to see what this says. Actually, point of order, in case you didn't know, it's

02:39:28.340 --> 02:39:32.660
the, uh, original translations, uh, for, uh, Thou Shalt Not Kill is actually Thou Shalt

02:39:32.660 --> 02:39:33.660
not commit murder.

02:39:33.660 --> 02:39:34.660
Interesting.

02:39:34.660 --> 02:39:35.660
Yes.

02:39:35.660 --> 02:39:42.500
See, I love how much crap they changed.

02:39:42.500 --> 02:39:44.660
You know you're opening a whole can of worms when you bring up religion.

02:39:44.660 --> 02:39:47.620
I'm not gonna bring, I'm not gonna open up the religion for the worm.

02:39:47.620 --> 02:39:52.740
My God, I mean, we get hate mail when Loki bashes on Mac, so we don't wanna get religion.

02:39:52.740 --> 02:39:55.180
And you know what, I usually forward all that over to his email.

02:39:55.180 --> 02:39:56.180
Oh, good.

02:39:56.180 --> 02:39:57.660
I don't get any hate mail.

02:39:57.660 --> 02:39:58.660
Exactly.

02:39:58.660 --> 02:40:01.220
Although I did share the funny Mac one with you.

02:40:01.220 --> 02:40:03.580
Yeah, whatever.

02:40:03.580 --> 02:40:04.820
That one was stupid.

02:40:04.820 --> 02:40:05.700
All right.

02:40:05.700 --> 02:40:06.900
We're going to go to a quick break.

02:40:06.900 --> 02:40:08.780
Boys and girls, when we come back, we're going to do a

02:40:08.780 --> 02:40:10.840
little bit of Ask Orange Lounge.

02:40:10.840 --> 02:40:14.420
And I just came back from a trip, and we were kind of off

02:40:14.420 --> 02:40:16.300
last week, except for, well, there was the

02:40:16.300 --> 02:40:17.300
music show going on.

02:40:17.300 --> 02:40:20.500
But we haven't had a chance to do some Ask Orange Lounge in

02:40:20.500 --> 02:40:21.020
a little while.

02:40:21.020 --> 02:40:24.260
So here's your chance to ask us something.

02:40:24.260 --> 02:40:25.500
Anything you want.

02:40:25.500 --> 02:40:28.300
So we're going to go just to some more music potpourri.

02:40:28.300 --> 02:40:30.480
I'll probably do another In the Groove song this break for

02:40:30.480 --> 02:40:35.480
you folks that are into that and I know there's a lot of folks out there that

02:40:35.480 --> 02:40:40.000
are into this song we haven't played it in a long time so like it or not here's

02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:43.240
some cartoon heroes we'll be back after this one more orange lounge radio and

02:40:43.240 --> 02:40:50.240
Ask Orange Lounge to send your questions in to Skye, be of type of message.

02:41:13.240 --> 02:41:18.240
We do the things you want to see, brain by brain, to the X-ray

02:41:18.240 --> 02:41:24.240
Our friends are so unreasonable, they do the unpredictable

02:41:24.240 --> 02:41:29.240
I doubt a lie to speak and say what we do and what we can't wait to do

02:41:29.240 --> 02:41:34.240
Let's go down north and far away, do it on the little bay

02:41:34.240 --> 02:41:40.240
Brain by brain to the X-ray, one by one we made it far

02:41:40.240 --> 02:41:46.240
We are the time to be heroes of the world We are the hope to find a man for the robot

02:41:46.240 --> 02:41:51.240
He's crazy by your back, crazy mind Oh no, don't wanna let him out, he's a vampire

02:41:51.240 --> 02:41:57.240
Get your fire back, we're running from the end We're time to run to the fire

02:41:57.240 --> 02:42:03.240
We've got a superman, we've got a metal man We're gonna shoot, we're gonna shoot, we're gonna fire

02:42:27.240 --> 02:42:29.240
Oh

02:45:27.240 --> 02:45:31.240
To the end, nothing to change my world

02:45:31.240 --> 02:45:33.240
The end you'll love

02:45:45.240 --> 02:45:48.240
I wanna stay with you tonight

02:45:48.240 --> 02:45:51.240
Baby, baby, I need you every time

02:45:51.240 --> 02:45:54.240
Love is on me and I wanna stay

02:45:54.240 --> 02:45:58.240
Give me baby and tell me you are my love

02:45:58.240 --> 02:46:01.240
And now you give me all your love

02:46:01.240 --> 02:46:04.240
And feel some pride for me, let's get it on

02:46:04.240 --> 02:46:09.240
I love you like you are baby, now I give you my heart

02:46:10.240 --> 02:46:13.240
Call me old man, Juliet

02:46:13.240 --> 02:46:15.240
Forever and together

02:46:15.240 --> 02:46:16.240
I love you babe

02:46:16.240 --> 02:46:19.240
Call me old man, Juliet

02:46:19.240 --> 02:46:22.240
Gonna tell us not to feel so true

02:46:22.240 --> 02:46:28.240
Roll me your hand, do me aye, forever and together

02:46:28.240 --> 02:46:32.240
I love you babe, roll me your hand, do me aye

02:46:32.240 --> 02:46:37.240
Nothing can change my world, me and you, love

02:47:02.240 --> 02:47:09.240
I just made that connection. I think the guy wanted to hear the Romeo and Juliet song from

02:47:10.240 --> 02:47:17.240
In The Groove and I played that one instead. Whoops! Boy, did I fuck that one up. I don't

02:47:17.240 --> 02:47:28.040
I fucked that one up. I don't care. I don't care. I don't care. Suck it. Alright. In that

02:47:28.040 --> 02:47:34.720
break you also heard cartoon heroes. I just thought he made a sad typo. It didn't connect

02:47:34.720 --> 02:47:43.360
to my mind at first. It's not my fault these people can't be unique and come up with unique

02:47:43.360 --> 02:47:47.360
titles for their songs

02:47:47.360 --> 02:47:50.000
max unlimited in that break to

02:47:50.000 --> 02:47:53.860
minimum and as a minimally in a minimal i think it's minimally and then the

02:47:53.860 --> 02:47:55.120
molly yeah

02:47:55.120 --> 02:47:57.840
yeah uh... by many something many something

02:47:57.840 --> 02:48:01.560
and in romeo julieto by lolita

02:48:01.560 --> 02:48:05.420
you know if you know you know i detroitian or deep no detroit yet to

02:48:05.420 --> 02:48:06.560
come to my end

02:48:06.560 --> 02:48:09.280
detroit and that's a cool name

02:48:09.280 --> 02:48:16.280
Here's a little clip of the other Romeo and Juliet song.

02:48:19.740 --> 02:48:23.640
You know I actually do like this Romeo and Juliet better too. Why didn't I think of this at first?

02:48:23.640 --> 02:48:28.240
I don't know. I'm just in a paramode tonight or something.

02:48:28.240 --> 02:48:31.320
I don't know. I can't believe I did that.

02:48:31.320 --> 02:48:35.800
Next time kids specify the artist if there's more than one song by the name

02:48:35.800 --> 02:48:37.520
or I might fuck your request up.

02:48:37.520 --> 02:48:48.080
I bet that guy's not happy, though, whose request I fucked up, but, you know, I'm human.

02:48:48.080 --> 02:48:49.080
What can I say?

02:48:49.080 --> 02:48:52.040
Yeah, the other one, it was Tomokun requested it.

02:48:52.040 --> 02:48:53.040
I know.

02:48:53.040 --> 02:48:54.040
I'm sorry, Tomokun.

02:48:54.040 --> 02:48:57.600
And he specifically spelled it a different way.

02:48:57.600 --> 02:48:59.040
It didn't click for me at first.

02:48:59.040 --> 02:49:00.040
I'm sorry.

02:49:00.040 --> 02:49:01.440
Ross doesn't care about our listeners.

02:49:01.440 --> 02:49:02.440
You know what?

02:49:02.440 --> 02:49:03.440
You found me out.

02:49:03.440 --> 02:49:06.960
It's just because In the Groove's forgettable, that's all.

02:49:06.960 --> 02:49:11.240
I was waiting for Loki to jump in there with some slamming in the groove comment.

02:49:11.240 --> 02:49:14.100
You snubbed my fanboy.

02:49:14.100 --> 02:49:15.240
I'm sorry.

02:49:15.240 --> 02:49:19.240
Dude, I may have snubbed your fanboy, but I didn't snub your stalker. I've been reading DDR Freak lately, and that's...

02:49:19.240 --> 02:49:25.760
Okay, my stalker is scary. Oh my god. Oh my god. No, no, no, no, no, no.

02:49:25.760 --> 02:49:27.920
This Blair is King guy.

02:49:27.920 --> 02:49:28.800
Yeah.

02:49:28.800 --> 02:49:33.700
Doc Sacra, I watched you leave in your car today.

02:49:33.700 --> 02:49:38.300
Are you going to lock another thread today?

02:49:38.300 --> 02:49:42.100
I mean, I really do want to thank...

02:49:42.100 --> 02:49:47.820
Iguana Girl is my best friend, and she will stick up for me as needs be, and she called

02:49:47.820 --> 02:49:49.820
him out for me.

02:49:49.820 --> 02:49:53.140
And I was like, okay, now I hope he doesn't do anything else.

02:49:53.140 --> 02:50:01.620
I've sort of been sticking to my assigned forums over on imaging and the UK forum and

02:50:01.620 --> 02:50:03.020
the moderator forum.

02:50:03.020 --> 02:50:08.020
and sometimes sneaking into random chat, so I've been good at avoiding him on the board,

02:50:08.020 --> 02:50:14.460
but it's like I still hear about things, so it's, ugh! Creepy! See, Tomo-kun is not creepy.

02:50:14.460 --> 02:50:18.500
Tomo-kun is fanboy. Fanboy is cool. Creepy stalker is not cool.

02:50:18.500 --> 02:50:22.660
Private messages with pictures of... He sends me private messages saying, you should probably

02:50:22.660 --> 02:50:25.860
warn this person. You should probably warn this person. You should watch this thread.

02:50:25.860 --> 02:50:29.540
I send those to Iguana Girl and sometimes you, and I'm not stalking you guys.

02:50:29.540 --> 02:50:35.540
I know, but he's like all the time doing it, and I'm like, oh my god, you're a freak.

02:50:35.540 --> 02:50:36.540
No way he is, he's a kid's ass.

02:50:36.540 --> 02:50:39.540
This poor guy's probably listening, and you're breaking his heart.

02:50:39.540 --> 02:50:40.540
I hope so!

02:50:40.540 --> 02:50:41.540
You're breaking his heart.

02:50:41.540 --> 02:50:44.540
I'm giving him a solid dose of reality, it's good.

02:50:44.540 --> 02:50:46.540
He sounds like a brown-noser to me.

02:50:46.540 --> 02:50:47.540
Good for the soul.

02:50:47.540 --> 02:50:49.540
Yeah, it actually does sound kind of like he's trying to kiss my ass.

02:50:49.540 --> 02:50:51.540
He just wants to be a mod, is that so wrong?

02:50:51.540 --> 02:50:53.540
Isn't that what all the kids want, is DDR Free Pod Hatership?

02:50:53.540 --> 02:50:55.540
Yeah, he wants to be a mod.

02:50:55.540 --> 02:50:56.540
He wants to be a mod.

02:50:56.540 --> 02:50:59.820
Being a moderator on DDR Freak is not all roses and sunshine.

02:50:59.820 --> 02:51:01.260
So he can get closer to you.

02:51:01.260 --> 02:51:03.260
Doesn't he know that...

02:51:03.260 --> 02:51:05.500
Don't say stuff like that! You're freaking me out!

02:51:05.500 --> 02:51:11.040
Doesn't he know that the mods on DDR Freak are pointed by God and you can't obviously

02:51:11.040 --> 02:51:14.060
become one unless you know you have like a miracle?

02:51:14.060 --> 02:51:16.720
Actually, if you want to know, we sort of vote on you, moderators.

02:51:16.720 --> 02:51:19.420
You have to have three miracles.

02:51:19.420 --> 02:51:20.780
Yes.

02:51:20.780 --> 02:51:25.740
And then after that we part the Dead Sea and...

02:51:25.740 --> 02:51:29.740
You know, spit nails, shit ice cream, that kind of thing.

02:51:29.740 --> 02:51:32.740
Alright kids, we gotta get to the next segment. You know it, you love it.

02:51:37.740 --> 02:51:40.740
Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid questions.

02:51:40.740 --> 02:51:44.740
What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?

02:51:44.740 --> 02:51:48.740
I think the first question is from BlairIsTheKing

02:51:48.740 --> 02:51:51.740
and the question he has this week is, Dark Sakura, will you marry me?

02:51:51.740 --> 02:51:59.700
I'm proud of myself for that one.

02:51:59.700 --> 02:52:02.380
I made that up.

02:52:02.380 --> 02:52:03.820
I should be on Whose Line Is It Anyway?

02:52:03.820 --> 02:52:07.980
RENEE has two queries, one for Loki.

02:52:07.980 --> 02:52:08.980
One for Loki.

02:52:08.980 --> 02:52:13.780
Since he's playing Star Soldier, does that freaky face that becomes whole mid-level boss

02:52:13.780 --> 02:52:15.580
still appear in the game?

02:52:15.580 --> 02:52:20.700
Yep, every single level almost.

02:52:20.700 --> 02:52:21.700
that

02:52:21.700 --> 02:52:27.220
uh... rini says and one for anybody who's played at e three i hear i heard

02:52:27.220 --> 02:52:33.040
i heard i heard that the e three demo for we heart katamari was exclusive for

02:52:33.040 --> 02:52:38.220
e three it was he even talks to you what was so exclusive about it he actually

02:52:38.220 --> 02:52:38.860
said

02:52:38.860 --> 02:52:42.480
that the others is convention with all these people playing this to see my

02:52:42.480 --> 02:52:44.660
beautiful presence or something

02:52:44.660 --> 02:52:46.720
so it's actually talking about

02:52:46.720 --> 02:52:48.060
people being at e three

02:52:48.060 --> 02:52:51.060
Yeah, it actually, in the text, it actually talks about, like,

02:52:51.060 --> 02:52:55.060
oh, we hope you enjoy this E3 demo, you know, and, like,

02:52:55.060 --> 02:52:59.060
I just remember the E3 was referenced in the King of Cosmos dialogue,

02:52:59.060 --> 02:53:03.060
and it's kind of too bad that that dialogue will probably never see the light of day in the real world,

02:53:03.060 --> 02:53:10.060
because it was that same, like, funny writing, quirky writing, that makes Katamari Damacy so special.

02:53:10.060 --> 02:53:12.060
So that was pretty much what it was.

02:53:12.060 --> 02:53:17.780
That game got delayed till September as well.

02:53:17.780 --> 02:53:20.700
Doh!

02:53:20.700 --> 02:53:25.680
I'll just say, hey Bradley, you live like what, five minutes from my house? Why don't you come over and

02:53:25.680 --> 02:53:29.260
Oh yeah, bring Katamari too! You can bring it.

02:53:29.260 --> 02:53:30.860
An HD loader and an HDL dump, you know.

02:53:30.860 --> 02:53:33.940
Our resident Poppy is the choir. You'll have to come over and show me how to get us it up, by the way.

02:53:33.940 --> 02:53:37.540
I have, I have, we love Katamari on an unmodded

02:53:37.540 --> 02:53:41.140
US PlayStation 2. If I, if I get a US,

02:53:41.140 --> 02:53:45.140
If I get the old-style PlayStation on a hard drive, can I still get an HD loader somehow?

02:53:45.140 --> 02:53:49.140
Yeah, there are free versions that are available for your memory card,

02:53:49.140 --> 02:53:53.140
and you can even run homebrew stuff and all that wonderful stuff without a mod chip.

02:53:53.140 --> 02:53:54.140
Good to hear.

02:53:54.140 --> 02:53:58.140
Sakurino wants to know, what does Loki think about stuffed penises?

02:53:58.140 --> 02:54:01.140
That's the question.

02:54:01.140 --> 02:54:03.140
Look at the monitor yourself, there it is.

02:54:03.140 --> 02:54:09.140
Well, honestly, we were going to get Rob an inflatable penis, and to surprise him,

02:54:09.140 --> 02:54:14.140
We found it at the adult store that we went to.

02:54:14.140 --> 02:54:19.140
We actually went to Gold Club Centerfolds with Rob's roommate and my fiance.

02:54:19.140 --> 02:54:22.140
Oh, and speaking of Rob's roommate, here comes X to her right now.

02:54:22.140 --> 02:54:29.140
And so my fiance, she got a lap dance and the stripper licked her boob.

02:54:29.140 --> 02:54:36.140
And then, well, she was getting like, you know, I personally had to pay for all three of us.

02:54:36.140 --> 02:54:43.180
So, that was a $150 adventure in which I got no lap dance and no boobs rubbed in my face

02:54:43.180 --> 02:54:45.640
and the G6 were fucking awful.

02:54:45.640 --> 02:54:46.640
What the hell happened?

02:54:46.640 --> 02:54:50.860
Lap dance is always better when the stripper is crying.

02:54:50.860 --> 02:54:51.860
X to Purr?

02:54:51.860 --> 02:54:52.860
Yes.

02:54:52.860 --> 02:54:53.860
Gay man?

02:54:53.860 --> 02:54:54.860
Uh huh.

02:54:54.860 --> 02:54:55.860
Stripper club?

02:54:55.860 --> 02:54:56.860
How?

02:54:56.860 --> 02:54:57.860
What the hell?

02:54:57.860 --> 02:54:58.860
What was up with it?

02:54:58.860 --> 02:54:59.860
Actually, I used to go all the time too.

02:54:59.860 --> 02:55:01.380
So, I bet.

02:55:01.380 --> 02:55:03.120
Your first experience, how was it?

02:55:03.120 --> 02:55:05.000
It was great.

02:55:05.000 --> 02:55:08.440
There were strippers. Can I say? Can I say anything?

02:55:08.440 --> 02:55:14.840
You can say whatever you want on the internet. Oh, I can? Okay. I saw a lot of pussy, and

02:55:14.840 --> 02:55:23.500
I saw a lot of ass. And actually, Loki's girlfriend pointed out to me that they bleach their assholes.

02:55:23.500 --> 02:55:27.280
And like, they really do. Oh my God.

02:55:27.280 --> 02:55:31.400
Like they seriously do. Like, it's like regular skin.

02:55:31.400 --> 02:55:33.400
THE SPEAKER LIFUS SHIPPERS!

02:55:33.400 --> 02:55:35.400
Yeah.

02:55:35.400 --> 02:55:40.400
And, um, so yeah, a lot of pussy, a lot of ass, a lot of boobs.

02:55:40.400 --> 02:55:42.400
But I didn't get boobs rubbed in my face either.

02:55:42.400 --> 02:55:43.400
Me neither!

02:55:43.400 --> 02:55:46.400
I'm telling ya! Okay, all three of us were sitting at the goddamn rail.

02:55:46.400 --> 02:55:49.400
I was tipping for all three of us because I had to.

02:55:49.400 --> 02:55:54.400
And, um, who gets the boobs rubbed in their face but my goddamn fiancÃ©?

02:55:54.400 --> 02:55:57.400
You know, as it should be,

02:55:57.400 --> 02:56:05.400
I think what we need to do is we need to crop just that little portion of the show right there and have that be the four-year consideration clip for next year's live agency 5-4.

02:56:05.400 --> 02:56:11.400
It's just expert going, and some strippers bleached their assholes!

02:56:11.400 --> 02:56:14.400
Orange Alarm's Radio, Video Game Radio.

02:56:14.400 --> 02:56:22.400
We like video games and, uh, stripper chat.

02:56:22.400 --> 02:56:25.400
You know...

02:56:25.400 --> 02:56:28.940
highward degenerating into

02:56:28.940 --> 02:56:34.760
pleased at holds that you know i will always get it better than um... then um...

02:56:34.760 --> 02:56:38.660
i think you just made some of your parents and i think i think i think we

02:56:38.660 --> 02:56:43.140
should also use that as the fake way to dark sacros tip of the week you know

02:56:43.140 --> 02:56:44.940
think you know

02:56:44.940 --> 02:56:47.700
we talked about the games are all the time

02:56:47.700 --> 02:56:49.580
we would have time to talk about

02:56:49.580 --> 02:56:58.580
strippers bleaching their assholes. Oh my god, it's actually funny, one of our listeners in the girl's chat says that she's heard about it.

02:56:58.580 --> 02:57:09.580
My god. So good job, good job, Sakarina. Bleach asshole chat. Good job. Your smart ass question about Loki liking stuffed penises just led to that whole discussion.

02:57:09.580 --> 02:57:15.580
That's it, that's it. From now on we no longer have Paris Hilton chat, we have bleach asshole chat. Same difference.

02:57:15.580 --> 02:57:19.220
still wants to go back to strip club but I want to go next time I got boobs in my

02:57:19.220 --> 02:57:25.780
face I got boobs in my face last time I I remember the very same love gay men

02:57:25.780 --> 02:57:30.940
and this is the only time oh yes yes they're like sure with a nice big

02:57:30.940 --> 02:57:35.500
rainbow they're like okay they're oh you're gay oh we could do all sorts of

02:57:35.500 --> 02:57:40.300
things to you I'm like what the hell they have this new flat in their

02:57:40.300 --> 02:57:41.300
boundaries.

02:57:41.300 --> 02:57:42.820
New platinum room and they tie you up.

02:57:42.820 --> 02:57:43.820
Supposedly.

02:57:43.820 --> 02:57:44.820
Anyways.

02:57:44.820 --> 02:57:45.820
Yeah.

02:57:45.820 --> 02:57:46.820
Alright, moving on.

02:57:46.820 --> 02:57:50.780
Listen to Zaku says, now that I, now that my ass has broadband, I need some cool things

02:57:50.780 --> 02:57:54.120
to do besides look at Prawn and the like.

02:57:54.120 --> 02:57:59.180
Some suggestions for Zaku now that he's upgraded to broadband.

02:57:59.180 --> 02:58:00.180
Downloading our podcast.

02:58:08.860 --> 02:58:09.860
this week?

02:58:09.860 --> 02:58:11.860
Did I mention that? Did I mention that?

02:58:11.860 --> 02:58:13.860
And vote for us on podcast.com.

02:58:13.860 --> 02:58:16.860
And then get a Bittorrent and download a bunch of Sentai TV.

02:58:16.860 --> 02:58:23.860
I was going to suggest online gaming now that you don't have to develop.

02:58:23.860 --> 02:58:24.860
Get into some online games.

02:58:24.860 --> 02:58:28.860
Oh my god, you can play free Ragnarok with me if I can ever get care at work.

02:58:28.860 --> 02:58:31.860
Try some online games.

02:58:31.860 --> 02:58:32.860
Play PSO with me.

02:58:32.860 --> 02:58:35.860
I'm wondering when I'm going to actually get back to playing Final Fantasy XI.

02:58:35.860 --> 02:58:38.860
All these console games distract me.

02:58:38.860 --> 02:58:47.860
Tomokun wants to know, why did my brother get a text message at 5 a.m. from his jobs assistant manager about his penis size?

02:58:47.860 --> 02:58:48.860
Drunk.

02:58:48.860 --> 02:58:54.860
Um, gay? I don't know. Probably not gay.

02:58:54.860 --> 02:58:56.860
Perhaps he had-

02:58:56.860 --> 02:58:58.860
American penis so big!

02:58:58.860 --> 02:59:06.860
Perhaps he had inquired about his penis size earlier in the day and his boss just finally got around to getting it done.

02:59:06.860 --> 02:59:09.380
Maybe you didn't hear the whole story.

02:59:09.380 --> 02:59:10.700
Maybe that's what's going on.

02:59:14.300 --> 02:59:18.380
Also, moving on, MJSI24 wants to know, I listen to the

02:59:18.380 --> 02:59:21.140
podcast mostly, as I can't listen to the live show

02:59:21.140 --> 02:59:23.500
usually, hey, you and about 1,000 other people, by the

02:59:23.500 --> 02:59:27.120
way, in comparing the ratings from a podcast to the live

02:59:27.120 --> 02:59:30.260
show, but I'm wondering when you record the podcast, what

02:59:30.260 --> 02:59:32.500
are you planning on talking about this week, and what day

02:59:32.500 --> 02:59:35.700
will it officially be posted to iTunes for download?

02:59:35.700 --> 02:59:39.940
We record our podcast, believe it or not, immediately after we do this show, which is

02:59:39.940 --> 02:59:43.460
why if we ever sound a little worn out, or what was the word that one of our emailers

02:59:43.460 --> 02:59:44.460
used once?

02:59:44.460 --> 02:59:47.720
We sound a little dead.

02:59:47.720 --> 02:59:52.620
We sound a little dead because we do this three hour show first and then we do the podcast.

02:59:52.620 --> 02:59:57.460
What we're talking about this week, Dark Sakura, tease that article you wanted me to

02:59:57.460 --> 02:59:58.460
read tonight.

02:59:58.460 --> 03:00:02.900
Yes, there's actually one I'm going to be talking about, those on BBC News, about how

03:00:02.900 --> 03:00:07.460
how parents don't actually pay attention to what the games are rated when they buy them.

03:00:07.460 --> 03:00:08.700
And admit it.

03:00:08.700 --> 03:00:11.280
So another fun parents are ignorant discussion.

03:00:11.280 --> 03:00:12.740
Should be a good time.

03:00:12.740 --> 03:00:16.180
What day will it officially be posted to iTunes to download?

03:00:16.180 --> 03:00:17.080
It should show up.

03:00:17.080 --> 03:00:21.780
It usually gets posted right after midnight Pacific time.

03:00:21.780 --> 03:00:23.300
So early, early Monday morning.

03:00:23.300 --> 03:00:24.680
They're supposed to roll out on Mondays.

03:00:24.680 --> 03:00:27.140
So when you wake up Monday morning, it should be there.

03:00:27.140 --> 03:00:30.580
If not, we had some type of internal problem and we'll get it up as soon as we can.

03:00:30.580 --> 03:00:36.260
So that should answer that.

03:00:36.260 --> 03:00:39.500
Tomokun wants to clarify he was talking about his own cock,

03:00:39.500 --> 03:00:41.500
as he put it.

03:00:41.500 --> 03:00:43.820
Not Tomokun, but anyway, forget it.

03:00:46.580 --> 03:00:49.140
I don't know.

03:00:49.140 --> 03:00:50.220
Yeah.

03:00:50.220 --> 03:00:50.900
I think that was it.

03:00:50.900 --> 03:00:52.340
That was pretty much all the questions we had.

03:00:52.340 --> 03:00:55.900
I thought we might have had one more.

03:00:55.900 --> 03:00:56.620
Did I lose it?

03:00:56.620 --> 03:00:57.180
What did I do?

03:00:57.180 --> 03:00:58.900
Did I accidentally close the window?

03:00:58.900 --> 03:01:01.900
Do we have any emails?

03:01:01.900 --> 03:01:07.480
Our emails were all for... Yeah, all the emails we get are the podcast.

03:01:07.480 --> 03:01:13.900
No one loves us. Remember, a thousand more people listen to the podcast than listen to this show.

03:01:13.900 --> 03:01:15.440
But that's okay.

03:01:15.440 --> 03:01:17.340
So we do this show because we love you guys.

03:01:17.340 --> 03:01:21.840
Really. This is just a labor of love now because we're certainly not getting the ratings.

03:01:21.840 --> 03:01:25.160
It smells like fresh podcast in here.

03:01:25.160 --> 03:01:26.760
are you talking about my podcast

03:01:26.760 --> 03:01:29.200
maybe

03:01:29.200 --> 03:01:33.680
that will never get old

03:01:33.680 --> 03:01:37.520
never never never ever ever ever

03:01:37.520 --> 03:01:40.920
uh... i guess what we'll do now is uh...

03:01:40.920 --> 03:01:43.480
end the show

03:01:43.480 --> 03:01:45.280
uh...

03:01:45.280 --> 03:01:48.000
what's so funny extrovert

03:01:48.000 --> 03:01:49.200
this way is that it

03:01:49.200 --> 03:01:52.200
well as we're done it's nine twenty nine about the time we are final thoughts

03:01:52.200 --> 03:01:55.260
out everything it'll be 930 and that's a done show and I'm sure the fortune

03:01:55.260 --> 03:01:58.700
cookie is probably another five minutes so we're running over anyway so whatever

03:01:58.700 --> 03:02:03.620
who cares we're done you want more tune in next week you want more and more tune

03:02:03.620 --> 03:02:08.500
into the podcast final thoughts boys and girls Loki or extra fur you're in the

03:02:08.500 --> 03:02:13.020
room why don't you start us off look or look extra fur extra fur what is your

03:02:13.020 --> 03:02:21.120
final thought in the groove wait a minute I said extra fur low-key what's

What's your final thought?

03:02:23.280 --> 03:02:30.520
My final thought is I have to play a lot more console games this week and strippers really

03:02:30.520 --> 03:02:32.280
do bleach their assholes.

03:02:32.280 --> 03:02:33.560
Thank you.

03:02:33.560 --> 03:02:34.560
Dark Sakura.

03:02:34.560 --> 03:02:35.560
Actually, I'll give you my final thought.

03:02:35.560 --> 03:02:38.720
My final thought is I'm sweating.

03:02:38.720 --> 03:02:40.880
It's hot in here and not in the good way.

03:02:40.880 --> 03:02:42.880
Dark Sakura.

03:02:42.880 --> 03:02:46.000
What do I say every show?

03:02:46.000 --> 03:02:47.000
Reject false bleach.

03:02:47.000 --> 03:02:49.380
Yeah, reject false assholes.

03:02:49.380 --> 03:03:04.380

His name is Data, I'm such a fan Oh, how I dream about this wired man

He's such a turn-on-the-space-age man My luminous lover, my electric man

03:04:43.360 --> 03:04:51.360
There's something about a positronic man The touch and the feel of his plastic hand

03:04:51.360 --> 03:04:54.360
I go wild when I see his eyes

03:04:54.360 --> 03:04:58.360
Of gold and of glow and of from inside

03:04:58.360 --> 03:05:02.360

Oh, wham, bam, thank you, man

03:05:09.360 --> 03:05:14.360

You know he's fully a-functional

And if he ever gets to us, well, I can always wish him off

03:05:35.360 --> 03:05:42.360

He's more than functional, it's not a dream I saw it once or twice on TV

03:05:58.360 --> 03:06:01.360
Full and functional, it's not a dream

03:06:01.360 --> 03:06:05.360
I saw it once or twice on TV

03:06:05.360 --> 03:06:08.360
I can't wait to plug into that band

03:06:08.360 --> 03:06:11.360
My logical lover
