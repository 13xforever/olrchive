Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of August 15th, 2005.
You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.
Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
Hello, once again, everybody, and welcome to another edition of Orange Lounge Radio To Go, your home for discussion on video games that don't suck.
It's all the news you really want to know about here on Orange Lounge Radio.
And big thank you to those of you guys who helped us.
I know you mentioned this, Loki, last week, but since I wasn't here last week, I'm back, by the way.
Hello.
They shipped him back.
Let's introduce ourselves.
My name is Rob Roberts.
You might know me as Sky.
Joining me is DarkSakura.
How did you get through all the packing tape and the bubble wrap?
Very slowly.
That's why I was gone two weeks.
Ah, it took you that long.
I just thought that they just got tired and shipped you back.
Possibly a little bit of that.
And the one and only Loki.
I am here.
Yes, you are.
All right, so we were...
We were kind of in an interesting position last week.
Since I wasn't here, Loki and DarkSakura couldn't use the regular studio, so they effectively had to record last week's show through two tin cans and a piece of string or something like that.
No, seriously.
A laptop and a headset.
A laptop and a headset.
And I had to edit in stuff, so don't complain.
So if you're wondering why last week's show sounded a little bit different, it's because it wasn't in the usual studio.
But you know what, kids?
That's how dedicated we are to giving you new material every week.
Some shows would have just said, oh, screw it, we're going to take the week off.
Nope, not us.
Not us.
Anyway, I just want to personally thank... I know Loki thanked last week.
I want to personally thank you guys for helping us out with the podcast awards and getting us a win over there for Best Gaming Podcast.
That's amazing.
That's incredible.
I can't even... Wow.
I mean, this podcast was originally supposed to be the little side show that we figured, oh, maybe a couple people will download it, the ones that listen to our three-hour show, and it'll be cute.
But now this thing is just like...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Send those to DarkSakura.
Okay.
See, I knew that would change your mind a little bit.
It would be Jamie spelled J-A-M-I-E, not J-A-I-M-E.
Hello!
Or J-A-M-Y.
No, no, no.
Actually, they've been misspelling my name.
Oh, well, yeah.
My name is on our website.
Freaking spell it right.
J-A-M-I-E at orangeloungeradio.com.
And they can send you money.
I'm taking my wedding presents and Amazon gift certificates.
All right.
Since I'm not registered anymore.
You'll have to let me know if you actually get anything.
That would be kind of cool.
That would be kind of cool.
So no other games in between there?
Well, I did play a couple things with Dan.
Nothing major.
I played some PSO.
Since I've been so busy trying to get my school stuff set up, I haven't been able to dedicate as much time to games.
Now, I hate to call you out on something, but you told me during the three-hour show tonight that you haven't been able to put down that Nintendogs five-minute demo.
You know, I played it five times.
What?
in the same day.
I thought you said you like burned it out.
You played it so much.
No, it's just I was getting frustrated because I kept playing Frisbee with the puppies and then I was like, oh, five minutes is up.
Bing!
Like, ah, I don't play with puppies.
You only have just like a little over a week to go.
A little over a week to go.
Puppies.
Loki, what's been going on in your gaming world?
I've been playing lots of games.
Mostly Burnout 3.
I love that game.
Every single minute.
I must look like some really hardcore crazy guy at my work because I bring my PlayStation to...
to work.
I set it up.
Within a 15-minute break, we play two races and disassemble it and take it back upstairs.
Who makes Burnout 3?
EA.
Are they paying you under the table to say good things about it?
No.
It's a great game, though.
But it's also, what's awesome about it is they've price reduced it already, so it's $19.99.
You can go out and get it.
I'm really anticipating Burnout Revenge, which is coming out in September, which will be awesome.
Other than that, I've been playing just a variety of import games from Taiko no Tatsujin for the PlayStation Portable, which is a lot of fun.
And then I've also been playing, I tried playing a little bit of Genji Dawn the Samurai, which is going to be coming out here in September.
Really looks cool.
I love that game.
It's just so pretty.
I just wish I could understand dialogue because I can't read Japanese, but whatever.
And then Namco X Capcom, which looks fantastic.
Disappointing, actually.
Really?
I thought it was going to be a cool role-playing game type thing.
It's a tactical RPG, and I don't like tactical RPGs.
When you say tactical RPG, you mean like Advance Wars, Final Fantasy Tactics style?
Like Final Fantasy Tactics, yeah, exactly.
I was expecting something different.
It looks, the intro movie's cool.
But you never got into Tactics or Disgaea?
Nope, I never did.
I don't like them.
I kind of like those games, so I've got to check this out.
I don't know.
But it'll be cool when it comes out over here.
And we love Katamari.
I've been loving that game.
I'm going to be playing this week 187 Ride or Die.
Oh, I tried Seven Sins too this week.
It's like The Sims 2, just with nudity.
Honestly, it's exactly like it.
It's really interesting and very annoying.
Seven Sins.
I'm sure that made Jack Thompson a very happy man.
Well, it's in Europe.
What's he going to do?
Tell the Europeans to stop their games?
They don't care about nudity.
Stop being naked all the time.
Next week, though, I'm playing 187 Ride or Die in Darkwatch for sure.
you got a busy busy gaming schedule I wish my list of games was as impressive but sadly since I've been traveling all I've had is handhelds I finally bought my own copy of Luminous because it's this long going story if you've listened to the podcast for several weeks now I bought a copy of Luminous before I had the PSP my friend accidentally took it one weekend I ended up just giving it to him as a birthday present because he loved it so much and I finally went and bought my own copy while I was traveling since I was on the east coast for a couple weeks um
I went to a DDR tournament while I was out on the East Coast and I played a new game called Percussion Master, which is pretty cool.
It's like a cross between Taiko no Tatooine and Drum Mania, if you're familiar with those games.
Taiko Drum Master was the American name of Taiko no Tatooine.
Pretty cool game.
I liked it.
I loved the song list.
It was fun.
But it's a game that I think might wear thin a little quickly because...
Thank you for watching!
Otherwise, I've just been playing a lot of handheld games.
I actually tried, I kind of forced myself to try and play some DS games that I originally had given negatives reviews for on the show.
One of them being Polarium.
Sorry kids, still can't get into Polarium.
Yoshi Touch and Go.
After playing Kirby Canvas Curse, it kind of has a dual effect.
I'm able to understand Yoshi Touch and Go more, and I'm able to get a little better at it and have a little more fun with it, but to me, it still feels like you're paying a full price for a game for just a two-level game, and I still can't recommend Yoshi Touch and Go.
I say, if you want a game like that, just get Kirby Canvas Curse.
It's a much more solid game.
So really, it's just been about the handhelds.
I still need pack picks.
One thing I want to bring up.
Oh, I still need to check out Pack Picks.
I want to check out Pack and Roll too when that comes out.
Pack and Roll is fun.
One thing I want to definitely mention about PSPs.
I used to kind of bash the whole UMD movies on PSP thing as not being a very good idea as what's the point.
I'll tell you what, after five hour flights on Southwest, PSP movies have become my favorite thing ever.
I'm so happy that my friend SharksGirl, who's been on some of our three hour programs on OrangeLodgeRadio.com, she loaned me some movies.
I finally saw Tron for the first time on PSP and I saw a movie called I, Robot with Will Smith.
Both great movies.
And I seriously should trademark this idea or something before somebody steals it.
and I think I might have mentioned this on a three hour show or something before.
I'm going to say it again because this is very apparent to me after doing a lot of traveling this weekend.
Somebody should start like a rental service for PSP movies in airports.
and have these places in all these airports?
It's called Altatoons.
Do they rent UMDs though?
They do?
I think they rent and sell DVDs.
I thought they only sold them.
Well, I'm pretty sure they do.
I know they are starting to do UMD games also.
Interesting.
I know there's some place that
All the tunes I want to say is one of them, but I can't remember if they rent or sell.
I want to say they do rent, though, because you can return them to other Ultatoon stores in different airports.
See, something like that for UMDs, I bet would make it killing.
Maybe not right away, but when PSPs really catch on, I think it would be a great idea.
They love those portable games, man.
If Ultatoon adopts that idea, they need to send me a dollar or something for giving the idea.
Anyway, let's get into some gaming news tonight, boys and girls.
Starting off with QuakeCon.
QuakeCon just happened recently and I heard that there were some new movies shown for Quake 4.
I haven't gotten a chance to see this, but apparently the Quake fans are all excited.
Somebody in chat during the live program this week was really excited about Quake 4.
I have seen them.
What did you think?
They were interesting.
Quake, though, is starting to look more like Halo.
Well, I wonder why.
It's not surprising.
It's running on the new Doom 3 engine, which is nice.
The movie that I saw looks like an all-out war right now.
You're in the trenches with this one guy and you're shooting these other things.
You see gunfire going up overhead.
It looks like Halo 2, basically.
I don't know.
It looks good though.
Here's what I thought was a really cool piece of information that also came out of QuakeCon.
John Carmack actually announced that the Quake 3 source code is going to be released.
Now, remember what the Doom source code release has done for us.
I mean, now we've got like Doom on the iPod and all this crazy stuff.
This is going to be pretty cool.
Quake 3 source.
I'm just wanting to see what they would turn it into.
Yeah, I'm kind of curious to see what kind of side projects come out of this.
Loki, you're kind of more in the hack and crack thing.
Is this going to be a huge...
What do you think about the Quake 3 source?
Couldn't hurt, definitely.
Let's talk about PSP and the firmware.
There's brand new firmware coming out.
It's actually going to come out today, August 15th, the day that our show is released.
It was supposed to be out a couple days ago, but they just have to wait a little bit because I guess there were some recent bugs to fix or something.
Just a reminder, the PSP firmware 2.0 will have that new web browser application which lets you browse the internet on your PSP from anywhere.
Wireless Hotspot.
So that's going to be pretty cool.
Also enhanced video and audio playback.
They're saying photo sharing options, broader network connectivity, and a more customizable interface.
So a lot of people looking forward to 2.0.
But of course, the downside to that, if you upgrade, say goodbye to the NES emulator for a little while.
At least until
You know they're going to find a way around the 2.0 fix.
They're working on it already.
Give it time.
I'm sure it'll happen.
Honestly though, if you're going to be upgrading because of a web browser, just wait.
Because they're already working on web browsers.
Hell, there's four already.
I mean, what?
If you really want to use a web browser, there's always Wipeout.
And there's already two other ones that they're working on.
Yes, but when they release a really popular game for PSP, like let's say the new Grand Theft Auto game, don't you think these games are going to force you to go to 2.0?
No, because what they'll do is they'll just dump the ISO of the game, and then you'll just be able to run it.
Okay, heaven forbid there should be people out there in the world that buy their games legally.
Okay, yes, you can still buy the game legally, but you can use your own software to dump the game and then run it on your memory card.
Kid Icarus
I'll be bringing up a Sony anti-piracy story a little later, which I'm sure you'll love.
But in the meantime, let's hear what's going on in the hack and crack world.
Well, glad you asked.
Because we're getting closer and closer to porting Linux to everything.
So why not start with the PSP?
Of course, it's not really ported.
It's just emulated.
So we have the x86 emulator.
And for those not to know, it's basically a PC emulator, you know.
x86 is emulated
You could run Oregon Trail on your PSP.
I don't know.
I'm just kidding.
Well, if it did, they have an emulator for that, too.
It's going to come out.
Eventually, you'll be able to play Oregon Trail on the PSP.
Hooray!
After all, that's what we're working towards, right?
That's exactly.
I don't give a shit about Halo 3.
I want Oregon Trail on the PSP.
You missed it, though.
Our live show two weeks ago, we had my good friend Kasumi19 on the show.
By the end of the show, she was playing Oregon Trail on her laptop.
See?
Smart woman.
Uh-huh.
Other stuff that's going on in the world of the PSP.
Someone actually made a home version of Kaboom for the PSP.
Rock on.
Rock on.
Kaboom was like the best Atari 2600 game.
So simple.
So simple, the concept of the game, but I remember being five years old and just being totally obsessed with Kaboom.
Well, don't get too excited yet.
It's still got tons of bugs.
It's the first game this guy's programmed.
It's programmed in a language called Lua, which you can actually program homebrew games.
Pretty simple for your PSP.
Okay, plus also the fact that it doesn't have that little dial controller.
I'm sorry, no other controller works the same as those little dial controllers that you had for Breakout and stuff.
It'll ruin it for me.
Yeah.
so you've got that so that's one thing you can look at the other thing is this operating system or I should say a GUI that they're making called P6 which is going to be able to run homebrew stuff and all that wonderful
Plus, they're talking about random wallpapers and yadda yadda yadda.
And then my favorite, Scorched Earth.
PSP's got a version .9 released right now.
They've got more stuff being worked on.
A scoring system, that sort of thing.
But it's getting closer.
Getting closer.
With all due respect, fuck worms.
It's all about Scorched Earth.
So, yeah.
Now, away from the PSP stuff, we've got Scum, which was that wonderful engine that ran Maniac Mansion in
My favorite game, Monkey Island, the secret of Monkey Island, came to the DS.
Perfect.
I can't believe that'd be awesome to try that out on the DS with a touchscreen.
It runs fantastic from what I hear, and there's info on that on this nintendo-ds.dcmu.com.uk I know, no one's going to get that, but anyways, it's out there.
Rewind, listen again.
Okay, cool.
Yeah, so...
Really cool stuff.
Very cool.
Alright, let's go to DarkSakura, who's got a story for us about... Well, what is this about, really?
Well, it's put out by BBC News, and I'm glad somebody, especially a prominent source like BBC, has pointed out that parents ignore game age ratings.
Surprise!
Big surprise.
A study commissioned by the UK games industry found that parents let their children play games for adults, even though they know they are 18 rated.
To quote Juergen Freund, he's a Modulum researcher,
Most parents think that their child is mature enough so that these games will not influence them.
Parents perceive age ratings as a guide but not as a definite prohibition.
There was a case where when the parents of a 14-year-old blamed the game Manhunt for his death.
And the police investigated it and dismissed it as part of the case.
You know, I'm fine with a parent...
Thank you for watching!
Careless parents with careless children that screwed up for everybody else.
There's also a notice on here that between January 2003 and July 2004, 16 out of the 1,208 games on sale in the UK were given an 18-plus certificate.
How well did those 16 games sell, though, I wonder?
Well, they actually interviewed about a thousand UK adults and a further 100 were questioned after buying a video game that was for 18 up.
Of course, a comment from a couple of the people, because they allow you to give comments back on this.
To allow an underage child to play an 18 plus rated game is irresponsible parenting.
I disagree.
I bet the same person would take their child to an R-rated movie if they screened it first, or if they knew something about it.
And I think if a parent knows a little something about the game, although of course this story talks about ignoring ratings, but I think if the parent knows that their child can differentiate between violence in a video game and violence in the real world, I think that's a parent's decision.
There's also another one on here that says, often media hype builds games up to be worse than they are.
Thank you!
Oh, yeah, hello.
Absolutely.
I think back to, remember we read a story a couple weeks ago on air about the blind guy who was playing games and kicking people's ass in Soul Calibur 2?
And the media said that he'd play Soul Calibur 2 and decapitate people in the game, which is not something you do in that game.
Actually, I want to go ahead and read his quote in full, if I may.
Sure.
The guy's name is Kenny's from Nottingham.
The violence in video games is often of a cartoon nature.
The outcry over Manhunt was laughable because the game was rubbish and wouldn't have sold at all but for the furor in the press.
Often media hype builds games up to be worse than they are, and by doing so makes them a must-have game that they do not deserve to be.
Grand Theft Auto San Andreas is no different in theme to its two predecessors, but its notoriety ensured its success.
Very interesting.
I have something.
Okay, Loki, you have something to add?
I have something to add to this.
There's also kind of a related story.
There was a study done in the University of Illinois, and they found no strong link between violent video games and aggression.
They basically did a survey watching players play this game, Astro's Call 2, a popular MMORPG, and basically saying that the results were that
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
All these age prevention things for mature games, it's all programmed into the consoles.
You can lock out content.
You have to have a code to get into it.
Yeah, you can lock this stuff out for your kids.
So if you're worried about your kids playing games because you're not supervising them, which you should be doing in the first place, you can lock this stuff out.
It's on every single console system, I think from the PlayStation up through the PSP now.
It's just... It's ridiculous.
Wow.
There's also one parent who replied on this one that talks about how the kids are swapping games with each other too and so they even don't have any control over that because their kids are taking the initiative.
That's a very interesting point but at the same time...
The parents should still be aware of what games their kids are playing.
There's another comment on here, just the last one I'm going to read, by Vicky in Glasgow.
She says, I definitely agree with the idea that an 18-plus certificate on a game makes it more desirable.
My stepson is instantly drawn to the game that he is not allowed to play, and it is a problem amongst his peers.
In fact, it makes an even greater problem when they are allowed to play these games at friends' houses with the blessing of friends' parents, but without our knowledge or consent.
Very interesting point there.
Kids are sneaky.
Very interesting point as well that the mature rating makes us want to play the games more.
Think about would anybody have ever bought the guy game?
Seriously.
They call it the sweet 18 in Europe.
Basically, 18 plus games sell better.
18 sweet.
Sweet.
Let's move on.
I want to mention something going on in another MMO.
Asheron's Call 2 got brought up in that previous story.
EverQuest 2, I want to mention this.
Apparently there was a big group of hackers that illegally created currency in EverQuest 2 and ended up causing the game's economy to suffer by 20% in just 24 hours.
Of course, then they finally got caught.
Chris Kramer, the director of public relations for EverQuest 2, said that they had a duping bug that made large quantities of platinum the game's currency.
The amount of money in the game was increased by a fifth in about 24 hours.
Hmm.
Very interesting.
So that's that.
EverQuest 2 is not a game that I've really played a whole lot, but I guess if you do play that game, that must have sucked to have that happen.
It's kind of strange thinking of a virtual environment as having its own economy.
I know, I know.
You know, when you stop and just think about that, it's like, oh my god.
But it's a huge part of any MMO.
Wow has its economy, Final Fantasy Labyrinth, any of them.
But actually, PSO, though, really doesn't.
Because there's no auction house in PSO.
Exactly.
You have game-controlled shops, and basically the only way to really... Players can sell stuff to each other, but that's really the only way to do it.
It's more of a barter system, and so there's no real economy to manipulate there.
I prefer that, actually, over the auction house thing.
Actually, they did limit the total amount of currency you can hold in Blue Burst compared to the Xbox.
Just an FYI, because I don't want to get any hate mail over this, the economy of the game was brought back to normal after the thing was discovered, so if you're an EverQuest 2 player, everything's A-OK.
You can go back to your EverQuesting now.
Enjoy your crack and your Slash Pizza.
Enjoy your EverCrack and your Slash Pizza.
I hope I don't mispronounce this.
Yannick?
Hey guys, regarding the media player that Loki mentioned on the last podcast, I have purchased the original media player back when I first got my PlayStation 2, and didn't really know what to expect since it came from Mad Catz, and I have a bad history with them.
However, this product is very reliable if your computer is fast enough to stream the video over to your PS2, and if the video is at the 320x240 resolution.
So basically going over this saying that Java stuff's buggy, but the Mad Catz one worked just fine.
Alrighty.
The one I was talking about, though, it's a little different than the media player he was talking about.
The one I talked about was actually streaming stuff off the PlayStation hard drive that you put in there.
So, similar, but I think you can do the same type of thing.
Any other emails you want to share?
Um, we also got one from someone named Blake, who writes us from Atlanta, Georgia.
Hotlanta!
Hey, I've been to Atlanta plenty of times.
I used to stay with relatives over in Alpharetta.
I got cousins in Augusta.
Although that's a bit of a drive from there.
You just started listening to our show a few weeks ago.
Great job.
You're one of the two podcasts I listen to.
What's the other one?
No, I'm just kidding.
I'm quoting.
Well, anyways, listen to your latest show when you were ranting about the game ratings.
I completely agree with you guys.
I'm 13 and my parents let me play any game I want.
Back when I was around 3 years old, my dad talked to me about game ratings and told me it was all fake and just a game.
Been playing Doom since I was 2, literally.
The only games they don't let me play are the ones with nudity and sex.
I'm stuck playing my God of War demo for PS2 since I can't get God of War due to the threesome.
Luckily, the GTA games never appealed to me.
I think you guys should talk more about the money since there's a lot of news coming up lately and I'm a huge fan of DDR and every other music game ever created.
I think that you should go to the PTA meetings and tell parents they aren't doing their jobs.
That's what we talked about last week.
That's great.
That's great.
We said we were going to march up on the PTA meetings and say, hey!
That's really interesting about the fact that the dad had to talk with him when he was really young, and that's good.
But you know what else is really good about that is that, you know, how would the parents know the God of War has a threesome?
What's to stop this kid from going out and getting the game?
and just saying, oh, that means the parents did their work.
Exactly.
You know, Blake, tell your parents that they are doing a fabulous job and they get the DarkSakura seal of approval.
There you go.
But I think Blake sounds mature enough where he can handle little boobs.
They're just boobs.
They're pixelated boobs.
I mean, come on, they're fake.
They're just boobs.
I really need to point out this family as a prime example of doing it the right way.
And on top of that, most kids are smart enough that they know the difference between what's real and what's not.
It's a polygon representation of boobs.
They aren't really fleshy boobs.
You have to wait a few years for that.
Do you have another email you want to read, DarkSakura?
I know I have one.
I have one I definitely want to throw in here.
Somebody sent an email.
Noah is the name, or N for short, and was mentioning that I'm getting back into Final Fantasy XI at some point and was inviting me to come play on the fairy server with them.
I know because I used to make jokes about the fairy server on the three-hour show.
The fairy server.
It has nothing to do with you.
A kind person who wrote this email.
It goes back to this whole LiveJournal drama thing.
RPG goddess.
People who roleplay on Final Fantasy XI.
I'm sorry.
I take that back.
Not that there's anything wrong with roleplaying on Final Fantasy XI, but people who take it a little bit too far.
So that is wrong.
There's nothing wrong as long as you know the difference between reality and Final Fantasy XI.
You know what?
I would...
And this person says that they've been playing since the US PlayStation 2 release and they're a level 22 slash 11 warrior monk.
And they got in there and this person's inviting me because they don't seem to know a whole lot of people that actually play the game as well.
I totally appreciate the invite.
That's great.
And I actually had a character on the Ferry server for a little while because there's a large contingent on there that I like playing the games with.
And...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
So I really appreciate the invite, but if I go back to the game, I'm going to have to go back to my family at Bismarck.
However, if you would like to come on over to the Bismarck server with us, that's assuming if I even get back into the game in the first place.
I still haven't decided on that.
Send me an email, rob at orangelaundry.com, and I'll get you a world pass onto Bismarck.
And plus, you can still add me to your play online list, and we can send messages back and forth and talk about how the economy on our servers suck.
So thank you for the invite.
I uninstalled play online.
I know you did.
P.S.
Opium
Thank you for writing us.
Yeah, I appreciate the email.
Loki, you have a story about the DS and it's going to get cheaper soon, right?
Yep.
What's going on with that?
It's going to be dropping by $20 to $130.
And they're saying around August 21st is when that's going to happen.
And the other thing is, well, what's Sony going to do then?
They're thinking about... Because I know the PlayStation 2 is dropping down to $99 pretty soon.
Nice.
And they're hoping...
That's going to steal some of Xbox 360's thunder, right?
I don't think so.
So yeah, that's going to be happening.
But hey, cheaper DS, Nintendogs, that's not a bad combo.
Puppies!
I think they're kind of smart.
I think they're really pushing this Nintendogs thing.
I know we have not shut up about this game on the show for several weeks, but there's a reason for that, guys.
This game is...
It's the next Pokemon.
Next Pokemon, I tell ya.
I think so too.
And wait till the commercials come.
Wait till the commercials come and the little puppies come up on the screen and the little girls are, Daddy, Daddy, I want that game!
I want the puppy game!
Puppy game!
Alright.
Thank you for blasting our speakers, everybody.
Are you loading up the Nintendogs demo right now?
I'm putting in the puppies.
Alright, let me do another Nintendo story where you're loading that up.
Oh, I can barely hear it.
I don't think they heard that at home.
Maybe a little bit.
Anyway, Nintendo is actually needing some help trying to get their new Wi-Fi network up in place.
Basically what it is, is they're asking that folks do a short little test.
It's a simple survey and a download on Nintendo.com.
Basically what happens is that it's going to ask for information on your internet connection and all the download does is it just pings Nintendo's servers.
and to kind of entice you to do it, it doubles as a Animal Crossing themed desktop clock.
So, you know, a little cute thing there.
That's cool.
Yeah, and basically what they're saying here on Nintendo's website, it says, by gathering information on which types of networking equipment our customers are using and how they have their home network set up, we'll be able to tailor the Nintendo Wi-Fi connection to be easy to use and available to the broadest audience possible.
well that's awfully considerate of them also the FAQ also says by the end of 2005 Nintendo DS owners will be able to play via Wi-Fi Mario Kart DS and Animal Crossing DS so if you want to help Nintendo out you want to help those guys out head on over to Nintendo.com and download the Animal Crossing desktop I forgot to mention coming in this fall when they do the price drop they're going to be offering a Nintendo DS package where you can get the DS plus Metro Prime Hunters not the demo
Metro Prime Hunters for $150.
Any more colors?
I'm surprised we haven't really heard any.
No, just that blue and red.
I think that was it.
I want the graphite one because the graphite one is cool.
I'm kind of surprised.
I'm surprised that we're even getting excited about colors.
There will be more colors.
Don't worry.
Where's the clear one?
That's what I'm surprised about.
All those first advanced, the Game Boy Advance, remember the old one?
They were all clear.
I don't know.
Anyway.
DarkSakura.com
Alright kids, you know what we gotta do now at this point is that we need DarkSakura to give you guys a little piece of her mind in the formative advice column because if we talked about video games all the time on this show, we would have no time to go around and find out the dark lives of strippers.
And those of you guys that listen to the three hour show know exactly what we're talking about.
The dark side is bleach.
And if you don't know what we're talking about, you should start listening.
Sunday nights, 6.30, 9.30 Pacific Standard Time.
Anyway, DarkSakura, what are you going to talk to us about on this podcast?
Today's bit of advice is how to deal with a stalker.
This is dedicated to my stalker, BlairIsKing on DDR Free.
Bravo.
Number one, firmly inform the stalker that if the unwanted behavior persists, you will take action.
Threaten to contact authorities or be a larger, stronger friend or relative.
Be prepared to do so.
Do not give in to any threats and be ready to secure a restraining order or civil protection order if it becomes necessary for your peace of mind.
Inform your family, friends, and co-workers of the situation.
Keep a paper trail.
Save any relevant letters, notes, emails, and voicemails.
Maintain a log or diary of your stalker's actions and report any unlawful behavior to the police immediately.
Report phone calls to both the phone company and the police.
Inform authorities.
Do not let fear of retribution stop you from taking action.
Take legal action immediately.
But my final piece of advice?
No means no?
Piss off!
Megaman Battle Network 6 How much cooler is that name?
I don't know.
But they are.
Capcom, this is one reason I bring it up.
Capcom is saying that Battle Network 6 will be the series climax.
Possibly suggesting that it will be the last.
Good, then they can get back to making more Mega Man Legend games.
Because those games rock.
By the way, Legends is coming to the PSP.
I just want more Mega Man X. I forgot about that.
I'm totally going to have to get that.
And I want it all 2D.
Also in the world of Captain Obvious Presents, Zelda will be made for the revolution.
I mean, come on, duh.
And in other news, there will be a Mario game for the revolution.
No, that's not official.
And there will probably be a Donkey Kong game.
That's not official.
Stop spreading rumors.
Stop spreading rumors.
Metroid will make its way to the revolution.
And another Banjo-Kazooie.
This is the official news, kids.
And this is mentioned in an interview with game designer Ije Anuma in Club Nintendo, the company's official magazine in Latin America.
About Zelda on Revolution, Mr. Owada has assigned me with the task of doing a Zelda game for the upcoming platform.
And that is our Duh!
News of the Week.
DarkSakura, what's going on overseas for our friends in the UK?
Well, first of all, Electronic Arts is going to be bringing out Everybody Loves, or I'm sorry, We Love Katamari.
You were about to say Everybody Loves Katamari.
Well, I was thinking Mina Daisuke Katamari.
Oh, okay, that's fine.
Because that's how I came to think of it.
Yeah, Electronic Arts is going to be publishing that.
I don't actually see anything about the first Katamari Damacy, though.
Didn't they finally get it, but like way later?
I think, yeah, way later.
But at any rate, it's going to be by EA instead of Namco, which Namco is bringing out our version next month.
Hooray!
But now, EA typically does this for Namco.
There's a lot of their games that they have done overseas.
But this is just good news for our buddies in the UK that they will see this game sooner rather than later.
Well, there's a funny little parody picture that says, We love Katamari Street.
But with a big EA Games logo on it.
Hopefully that won't be the game coming out in the UK.
I love, though, if ever you look on the Japanese cover, and there's big scans of it online, all the Namco employees out in front of it, but if you look in the windows, reflected on the windows is the King of All Cosmos taking the picture.
Oh, that's cool.
You know, I didn't get a chance to say this since I wasn't here last week, but I hate the American box art.
It's awful.
I haven't seen it, actually.
It's kind of hidden in that parody graphic.
It's kind of hidden.
It's awful.
I hope it was just a mock-up done by some game company, because I did not care for the box art at all.
I've seen the box art.
It's...
Thanks for watching!
Any more UK news, DarkSakura?
Also, the game premiered on Yahoo UK and Ireland video games is The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe for PS2.
It's actually still in production, but the review of it is just...
Thank you for watching!
at the end, I guess.
Loki, you were telling me at some point that you had actually gotten to play this game, somehow, at E3?
Briefly, like five minutes worth.
It looked very interesting, and it reminded me very much of the Lord of the Rings game, just the way that it was, because it was kind of that isometric, top-down type of thing, and it looked pretty good.
I mean, it looked good.
I honestly don't remember much of the language in the wardrobe.
I read all the books, like, way back in elementary school, but...
Call of Cthulhu.
The official site is up.
CallofCthulhu.com
Coming out in September.
I was going to say, isn't that game coming out very soon?
Pretty soon.
I know I've been gushing about the game, but you can go to CallOfCthulhu.com to check out the official art.
Background on the Cthulhu myth.
There's downloads on there.
It's a great site.
Awesome.
Anything else?
One last thing.
Sure.
Not necessarily specifically related to the UK, but Koei, who was one of my favorite games ever, Keio Yugekitai, Keio Flying Squadron, back on the Sega CD.
And I remember them for Romance in Three Kingdoms.
Nobunaga's Ambition, that's it.
They were at Tokyo Game Show and announced their lineup.
and to quote my source, let's just say we hope you like Dynasty Warriors.
Coming out, we have Dynasty Warriors 5 Special working title for the Xbox 360 coming to Japan this winter.
We have Dynasty Warriors 5 Extreme Legends on PS2 September 15th in Japan.
Dynasty Warriors DS without a release date yet.
Outside of Dynasty Warriors, we also have...
Neo, Summer 2006, Winback 2, Project Poseidon, Romance of the Three Kingdoms for the DS, which will be September 2005.
And then also for the Japan-only releases, there's Uncharted Waters Online for PC and Nobunaga's Ambition Online.
Here you no show.
So they're bringing out a couple of MMOs.
Dynasty Warriors 5 for the PlayStation 2 is coming out in September.
Wow.
All right.
In the U.S.
All right.
Loki, I know you've got a story about Halo 3.
Yes, Halo 3, there's been some rumors coming out of the Bungie employee area there.
They basically said it's going to be more darker and grittier than the previous games.
They want to actually have an online cooperative part of the game, which would be fighting bots, which is really interesting, and that's part of the storyline.
Hmm.
A lot more cinematics Multiplayer mode with up to 50 players online
Delta Force Live, Blackhawk Down, up to 50 players online.
I've seen some on PC that are like 100, so that's not too big a deal, but I'm not surprised that they're going up to 50 players because the big team battle games that are the 60 player are really popular, so I'm not surprised.
This was a bit interesting.
They're attempting to implement both a map editor and a movie maker.
Suns Red vs. Blue.
Wow.
That reeks of fan...
I hope it's true.
That would be pretty funny.
You never know.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I'm going to go ahead and do another story here about Midway and some of the games that they have coming up here.
You remember they were partnering up with MTV Games?
Well, they really haven't said anything new on this, just the LA Rush partnership, but they are saying that a second game will hit in early 2006.
Also, what I thought was interesting is they are actually creating a game based on the show from Adult Swim, Aqua Teen Hunger Force.
Oh, God.
And that will be coming out in early 2006 as well.
That's going to be nuts.
Mortal Kombat will be coming out on the PSP called Mortal Kombat Deception Unchained.
It's supposed to ship in the first half of 2006.
It'll have some new characters and content, including some of what was seen on the GameCube version of Deception, like Goro, Shao Kahn actually being playable characters.
Also, Wi-Fi support.
More information to come soon.
And also, Spy Hunter...
They are working on something, but they won't say a whole lot.
Oh, I guess I should also say this one.
Unreal Tournament 2007.
Very early look given at E3, but the next entry in the shooter franchise, they are working very hard to make it a game with as long a shelf life as its predecessors.
Not a whole lot of information on Unreal Tournament outside of that.
I still need a couple, of course, on PSP.
Still waiting.
Have fun.
Just a matter of time before that poor guy gets a cease and desist, by the way.
And we'll have that follow up in a future podcast.
PlayStation 3, as you guys may or may not know, they're going to go Blu-ray.
What's interesting is that they are really kind of enforcing that it's not going to be easy to copy.
I mean, of course, not only Blu-ray piracy is going to be years off as it is, but Sony is working with the Blu-ray Disc Association to prepare the most comprehensive content management system ever employed on an optical disc format.
Hmm, supposedly it's going to happen through a system called Blu-ray's Advanced Access Content System, and also a ROM mark.
And this is made to guard against mass production piracy or duplication and unauthorized copies.
Hmm, Loki, what do you think?
Will it work?
Yeah, you know, I remember another story saying that the UMDs would never be cracked and could not be copied because they could not be read by a PC.
Oh, no wait, they're wrong there.
Let me put it this way.
If it can be read by something, it can be copied.
That's the bottom line.
It will be done no matter what the hell they do.
It will not work.
And basically, this is really just going to prevent people until you can copy a full Blu-ray just like you can copy a DVD.
Yeah, it's going to be harder, but it can be done.
They said the same thing about the GigaDisc, but you can actually buy GD-ROMs.
Well, that's that.
And lastly tonight,
GamePro Magazine teamed up with Mad Magazine to present the 10 worst things about video games and you can check out a preview of the 10 actually I'm sorry the article is about the 50 worst things the article online is the 10 and you can check it out over on GamePro.com they have this just a couple of these points see if you guys here in studio agree with them one
Game designers who cannot understand why more women don't play video games, especially since they feature such outstanding female role models as a globetrotting archaeologist with big boobs, world-class volleyball champions with big boobs, and, of course, easily murdered hookers with big boobs.
And then, of course, they have the picture as drawn by Mad Magazine to go with that.
Ho, ho, and ho.
Console manufacturers selling systems without basic essentials like memory cards or a second controller.
So you have to shell out another $60 before you can...
See so much as a hair on Luigi's mustache
Oh, this will make Jamie upset, so I have to read this one.
Sega's long, pathetic parade of short-lived console systems, from the Sega CD to the 32X to the Saturn to the Dreamcast, establishing a legacy of failure on its way to rivaling that of the Chicago Cubs.
You know, the systems only failed because people didn't appreciate them.
And Sega, I have to say, had really stupid marketing.
They had good systems, good solid systems.
But they weren't given the support that they needed.
You know, the Saturn.
The Saturn in Japan?
Brilliant system.
I mean, just had so many great games, would regularly hold its own neck and neck with the PlayStation.
But over here, did we get a lot of the cool crap?
No.
The last good game we got was Burning Rangers.
And it was actually, if I'm correct, the last game that was on the Saturn over here.
Which I, luckily enough, now have a US copy of.
Thanks to Classic Gaming Expo.
Still love Mad Magazine after that little tidbit.
Don't make me break out like, you know, the broken neck voice.
If you guys want, you can check out the list over on GamePro.com or you can just pick up the magazine when it comes out soon.
that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio to go thanks you guys so much for tuning in and listening to us and again can't say thank you enough for the podcast award which by the way are we going to go to the expo to pick up that award in person somebody's going to have to go I don't know we'll see it's on a weekend right I think so I'll drive down we'll get in the car go to Ontario it'll be fun it'll be like the live 365 awards but times like four times the distance
Ow.
Anyway.
It's a Saturday, right?
And thanks to our buddies at Apple who put us on the iTunes directory too.
What?
It's on a Saturday, right?
I think so.
I don't know.
I'll look up the details.
You can drive down there.
Two or three day con.
We could do it.
We could do it if we really wanted to.
We'll see.
Anyway.
Final thoughts.
Loki.
Burnout 3 is awesome, but you know they can really get rid of the announcer or have it so you can bypass the training videos that take up five minutes of my time.
My final thought is shake your body, shake your body, shake your body down to the ground.
DarkSakura, your final thought.
I normally say I reject false icons at this point, but I'm just going to say that I'm looking forward to the day that Jack Thompson is laughed out of court, you stupid fucker.
And on that note, have a great day.
That's the end of another Orange Lounge Radio To Go edition.
This podcast is a proud part of www.orangeloungeradio.com.
