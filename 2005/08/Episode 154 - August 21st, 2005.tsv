209808	210949	She's actually out tonight.

225357	226498	But she won't be here for a little bit.
226978	231741	So filling in, we have the one and only, since he's sitting in the fluffy green chair, I'm saying he's filling in.
232421	234703	The one and only Miklatov, say hello.
236328	238669	Pause, Meteos, and say hello.
240290	241190	Turn the mic on.
241210	241690	There you go.
242130	243731	It hasn't been that long since you've been here, has it?
244391	244951	A couple of months.
245172	245712	Yeah, a little while.
246352	251734	All right, so I'm sure he'll be telling us a whole lot of nothing tonight because all those stupid NDAs.
251814	253835	So why do we even have you on this show?
253855	254955	I can't remember.
256616	257857	Because I get drunk a lot.
258077	258357	Oh, yeah.
258377	258977	Well, not tonight.
258997	260117	Yeah, what's the point?
260157	263399	I mean, after all, you know, GamePro is just breaking all this news.
263439	263919	What's wrong?
264904	267885	They don't get in trouble for spilling the stuff that they're not supposed to be.
268045	268945	They didn't sign anything.
268965	274126	But GamePro's crappy, so they don't know that it's GamePro.
274226	277687	The one voice over there you hear is the one and only Techmaster Loki.
278547	280428	I am here, and I love bacon.
281028	281448	Yes, you do.
281748	282388	You do love bacon.
282968	283348	All right.
283748	287529	Also joining us tonight, we have other special guests, not just those folks.
287589	289930	We've got the one and only Jazz.
290970	291230	Hi.
291650	291970	How are you?
292010	292891	Wow, that mic's loud.
293151	293631	That's all right.
293991	294371	No, my voice.
294773	295153	That's right.
296134	296675	I'm fine.
297716	298116	Good to hear.
298997	299317	Alright.
299597	307164	Say hello also to the one and only, the guy who turned this show NC-17 last week with a single sentence.
307645	309747	Say hello to my roommate, Extifer.
309947	310508	Yo.
311328	311689	Alright.
313290	317474	Alright, so we're going to take a quick break and then we're going to come back and dish for a little bit.

584207	588833	There's just a lefty thing And there's nothing left here to remind

699631	702333	Go left, go right, go left, go left, go left, go left
728749	729109	Music Gaming
752627	753468	MusicBaseVideoGames.com
774656	776177	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
803047	829192	I got to play some more games, um, Darkwatch, for, you know, briefly, then I got bored of Darkwatch after about five minutes, just because, you know, first person shooters, eh, I just didn't have the time to dedicate to it, so Burnout 3 it was, because I took down 54 cars in one match, and that was fucking awesome, that was one of the best races I've done, uh, it was just like, I was in the zone, just like, knocking off cars, you know, three at a time, and
830150	833894	You have been obsessed with Burnout 3, just like I have been obsessed with Meteos.
834094	834774	I cannot stop.
834834	837296	And now, Miklatov is obsessed with Meteos.
837757	840139	Well, then also, I got to play actual music games.
840159	843822	I got to play Taiko no Tachigen while I was waiting for Nelly to get out of the doctor's.
847181	868152	On the PSP, you didn't lug the big drum into the doctor's office or anything I do lug my PS2 around though, I do do that And I kid you not, this is how addicted to Burnout 3 I am I will lug my PS2, I carry it with me to work I'll lug it downstairs, we'll hook it up to the TV We'll play two races and unhook it up in a matter of 15 minutes
868993	872134	That's pretty much all I did that was super exciting.
872174	873114	I saw a 40 year old virgin in that movie.
873134	873695	It was hilarious.
893106	894006	I love it.
894046	894687	Highly recommend it.
894747	896488	Was it funnier than There's Something About Mary?
896508	896988	Yeah.
897548	900189	It was one of those movies you actually laugh out loud.
900249	901550	It was just really funny.
902570	906112	Steve Carell is awesome, and all the supporting cast was awesome as well.
906172	907553	So, really good movie.
908013	908953	Comment from the chat room.
909013	914276	Fireboma says, Any game that enables you to produce Final Destination 2 pileups are great.
915736	917417	If you remember the beginning of that movie.
917997	919138	If you want to join our chat...
919693	921674	and have comments randomly read on air.
921755	923396	OrangeLoungeRadio.com, click on chat.
923816	927118	That's the difference between this show and the podcast, really, is that you get to interact with us.
927198	930241	The thing that pisses me off about Burnout 3, though, is I can't find cheat codes for it.
930501	934104	And, you know, it being on my hard drive, it makes it a little hard to cheat.
934164	939407	There is a way, though, Code Breaker version 9, I guess you can do that, but I have 8, so I have to see if I can upgrade that or something.
939427	939788	I don't know.
940348	947053	But, yeah, it looks like it's going to be really fun, and I'm waiting for Burnout Revenge, because that's next month, so...
947912	948492	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
968277	972020	College DJ, okay, that's on MTV, okay?
972040	973921	I think I got my start.
975102	980545	Hey, you're listening to Chico State Radio, and now it's some Beck, and coming up, more Beck!
982307	988791	No, honestly, it's very annoying, and I've turned the announcer off a few times, and he keeps coming back.
989506	999014	and also if you don't play the world race mode right off the bat, you'll keep getting these stupid training videos that pop up and they're like five minutes long and you can't bypass any of them.
999094	1000095	That sucks.
1001697	1007462	And also some of the physics in the game were a little touchy and the AI is a bit too rubber bandy and it's just, I don't know.
1007622	1011845	But Burnout Revenge, from what I hear, fixes all of that and the game is amazing.
1011865	1012966	I can't wait.
1012986	1015649	Because you can also do, I guess...
1016793	1018193	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1048188	1048809	That's about it.
1050550	1051191	That was my life.
1051251	1051811	And I worked.
1052192	1053433	You worked a lot this week?
1053553	1054774	Yes, and I hated it.
1055094	1056135	I hated it so much.
1056215	1057796	Don't talk about you don't like it.
1059098	1062821	Don't say that when Konami people might be listening to this show, you dumbass.
1063430	1064551	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
1086532	1090476	Based off the original Frogger, and well, it's a Frogger game.
1090836	1094160	If you can take care of Hawaii, it's all Hawaii.
1095361	1097142	Let's just go to Hawaii and beat some people up.
1097182	1098624	Yeah, I mean, it's that simple.
1098884	1102187	Japan needs to, you know, bomb them again.
1102427	1105090	Again, for those that don't know Miku Latavi, he actually works at Konami.
1105951	1106191	Can you
1106867	1108148	What can you tell us about your job?
1108188	1114432	He's under a lot of non-disclosure agreements, which means if he says things that he's not supposed to, he gets a spanking and possibly fired.
1114452	1117814	They should put a little collar around his neck if he says something he's not supposed to.
1117834	1119795	That transmits back to the home planet.
1120956	1122156	So what can you say about your job?
1122176	1124217	Well, okay, people know I do DDR.
1124718	1129721	And, I mean, if you look at instruction booklets, you see lists of testers and stuff.
1129921	1131562	And so you see my name there, too.
1131662	1133623	So, I mean, you can gather that information.
1133803	1136025	I test and I do DDR and I do other things.
1136265	1139488	So would it be fair to say and feel free to say you can't answer if you can't?
1139508	1140269	I can't answer that what?
1141490	1142191	I didn't even ask!
1143152	1144853	Is DDR the only game you work on?
1145274	1145414	No.
1145434	1145935	No, it's not.
1146335	1147356	Okay.
1147496	1149298	Do you work on games other than Bomani games?
1149518	1149738	Yes.
1150219	1150379	Okay.
1150399	1150519	I see.
1151420	1151620	I see.
1152185	1153186	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1168913	1169173	No.
1169893	1173674	Any songs from any purple-looking games that you can think of?
1173734	1175935	Oh, you're talking about Beatmania, aren't you?
1175995	1176355	Yeah.
1176515	1177335	Okay, hold on.
1177475	1178235	I can clear this up.
1178775	1179736	You know about Beatmania?
1180316	1182696	We don't know anything more than everybody else does.
1182796	1187197	When we saw those pictures for the first time is when you saw those pictures for the first time.
1187717	1189178	So it was shocking to us, too.
1189218	1191198	But IGN saw them before everybody saw them.
1191218	1191978	I know, they're jerks.
1194099	1194779	I hate IGN.
1196946	1197266	What's up?
1197487	1198328	Can you tell me about this?
1198568	1199909	What the hell's up with GamePro?
1200290	1200830	What the hell?
1201070	1202612	How come they beat you to everything?
1202772	1208178	They're a nobody, like, pays attention to magazine, so they can say whatever they want.
1208979	1212583	They need to say something to get some readers, and then they have readers for a day.
1212703	1213483	Disclaimer, guys.
1213684	1216847	Miklatov's comments are his own, and do not necessarily reflect those of Konami.
1216867	1218369	They are wannabe EGM, okay?
1220110	1225053	GamePro used to be the shit back in the day when it was GamePro and Nintendo Power.
1237655	1241959	Every day they would walk in and see the big list of the club members and go, Ha ha ha ha ha!
1242519	1243800	Stupid people!
1245621	1254528	See, the only thing I remember from GamePro from my childhood is the two covers, the American Gladiators one, and the Gremlins 2 one, and then everything else is a blur.
1254749	1256470	Because the American Gladiators one.
1258939	1259959	What's that noise?
1260380	1260800	Forget it.
1261960	1266882	I can't remember when I pinched my cheek at the cover.
1267162	1267762	Forget it.
1268563	1269683	Forget it.
1269903	1271444	Rob was trying to save it.
1271524	1273264	He was masturbating to the cover.
1273324	1274825	Yeah, when I was nine.
1275985	1281107	This is what we call a radio gag because they can't see that I'm pulling my cheek.
1281567	1284268	It sounds over the sound waves.
1284348	1288210	It sounds like... This is what we do when we don't have...
1288888	1291870	Soundboards with different audio effects.
1291930	1294212	We have to make them ourselves.
1294692	1297515	But still, I was like nine when that cover came out.
1297775	1301738	So if you're saying that I was masturbating at nine... Dude, some people were!
1301758	1304100	You know, people can keep magazines.
1304120	1305541	They don't just disappear.
1306081	1308863	But it had like laser on the cover.
1308883	1311345	I didn't even remember who was on the cover.
1311385	1313407	It was Gemini, laser, and some chick.
1313567	1314267	Okay!
1314467	1314708	Those...
1315328	1320171	Those Farrah Fawcett posters were in guys' bedrooms for like 25 years.
1320871	1321231	Okay.
1321271	1322192	They need lives then.
1322332	1322812	I guess so.
1323052	1325674	And Loki, what are you talking about that we don't have a soundboard here at the station?
1326854	1327895	God damn!
1328916	1329816	Ow, my foot!
1330016	1332137	Why did I shoot myself in my foot?
1336627	1337407	Oh, I have something else.
1337647	1337828	What?
1338148	1338768	Okay, and a drink.
1340129	1346872	We were at IHOP today, and we were sitting in the back of the place, because that's where they made us sit.
1347552	1356376	And so we're having our normal discussions, and Extifer has his little rainbow shirt on, and Justin, I don't know, did you say Jazz or Jazz?
1356896	1357436	Justin, okay.
1358497	1359197	Sorry, my bad.
1359417	1359997	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1382935	1383636	Thanks for watching!
1402628	1405009	That guy on that radio show said he was gay.
1405729	1406269	Oh no.
1407090	1412391	You know, come to think of it, we have an interesting setup tonight because I know, I was like, well wait a second.
1412451	1418233	Loki's sitting in the center of the room and he's surrounded by a bunch of bags.
1419054	1420194	Eh, I'm used to it.
1421114	1422255	What do you mean you're used to it?
1422275	1423875	What do you mean you're used to it?
1424415	1424896	What the hell?
1424936	1426696	We shared an apartment for like two years.
1426716	1427616	I mean, come on.
1428037	1431118	So when Rob had his orgies in the middle of it?
1431158	1432098	I never had orgies.
1435146	1436867	is the best spot to see the TV.
1437707	1438547	Loki, hold on.
1439007	1440248	Hold on to this biscuit, Loki.
1440588	1441468	Just close your eyes.
1444009	1444889	Anyway, moving on.
1444949	1446590	Anything else you want to share about your week?
1447230	1447450	No.
1447930	1448250	Okay.
1448310	1449471	You can go back to Meteos now.
1449511	1449831	Hooray.
1450391	1452211	Wait, this is the first time you've played Meteos.
1452251	1452792	Yeah, really.
1452852	1454272	This is pretty much the first time I've played it.
1454292	1454932	Pretty cool, huh?
1455192	1455632	What did I tell you?
1455712	1462715	I hate it because there's nothing really to do in it, but then I just got to keep moving the stylus and make blocks fly up, but they fall back down.
1463355	1463435	So...
1464854	1465895	This makes me think of a question.
1465955	1467996	At Konami, are you allowed to play?
1468036	1469657	Because you get your breaks and lunch.
1469697	1471598	I'm assuming they don't slave drive you guys too much.
1471618	1473118	You actually get a break and a lunch.
1473318	1473779	Oh, yeah.
1474219	1475500	We play whatever we want.
1475560	1478421	I play Pump It Up there.
1478801	1480402	Can you play whatever you want on your breaks?
1480822	1486205	Oh, it was funny because I was playing Pump It Up and I was talking to somebody that was a little higher up than me.
1486685	1489086	I was saying how much I like Pump It Up more than DDR.
1489507	1490247	And then the higher up
1490666	1494469	for all of us came in and he told him and I had to explain myself.
1495449	1495890	It was great.
1495990	1496990	But yeah, I play Pump there.
1497751	1499132	That's pretty much all I do on breaks.
1502154	1502674	That's great.
1502994	1506577	What are other hot games in the office right now that are not Konami made?
1506817	1508998	Dr. Mario for Nintendo 64.
1511420	1512341	Kind of random.
1512401	1512741	I didn't even...
1513001	1515704	I didn't even know they made Dr. Mario and Tetris 64.
1516284	1519207	I remember Pokemon Puzzle League, but I don't remember Dr. Mario 64.
1519247	1521649	Wasn't it like Dr. Mario and Tetris or something?
1522550	1523411	Oh, that's right.
1523931	1524492	I'm not sure.
1525313	1528115	Pump It Up and Forza Motorsport.
1528255	1530478	That's the ones that get played that aren't Konami games.
1530578	1532099	You mean you're not playing Enthusia?
1533140	1535382	Forza Motorsport is what we play there.
1535823	1536343	Nothing else.
1537905	1538265	All right.
1540385	1546508	Oh, and on a, I have to ask, maybe you can't tell me because this is a Konami-related game, but how's the Winx game turning out?
1547288	1547808	NDA.
1548629	1549089	Damn you.
1550690	1553251	Can't tell me shit about DDR, now you can't tell me shit about the Winx?
1553431	1558353	Winx Club has now been, it's been relabeled as adult only, so, you know.
1558653	1561254	Yes, I mean, dude, the Winx get topless.
1563575	1565116	The Winx hot coffee edition.
1566434	1568035	Honestly, it wouldn't surprise me.
1568195	1569095	That's all I'll say.
1569695	1570255	Whoa, hey.
1570895	1571696	Alright, moving on.
1571716	1573016	That's what the franchise needs.
1573996	1575797	Let's go over to Justin.
1575917	1576437	How was your week?
1576477	1577157	How was your day, sir?
1577978	1580578	My week was pretty uneventful.
1580718	1590741	I played Final Fantasy for most of the week, and when I wasn't playing Final Fantasy, I was starting up school again, which kind of sucks, but it's something to do, so that's good enough for me.
1591902	1596083	Then on Saturday morning, I drove up here, and we hung out
1596693	1604395	and we went to IHOP and that was funny with the lesbians because they specifically told me that it was because of my shirt they could tell we were all gay.
1605475	1607415	Yeah, your shirt made us all gay.
1607775	1607875	Yes.
1607895	1608295	That's great.
1608635	1609035	I love it.
1609516	1613936	Yeah, because gays aren't allowed to associate with straights in public, only behind closed doors, apparently.
1614176	1614496	Indeed.
1616277	1617637	Besides that, that's about it.
1618537	1618857	All right.
1619157	1619337	Yep.
1619617	1620038	Exciting.
1620958	1622258	Extra for anything you want to share?
1625293	1628334	My week was really cool, I guess.
1628954	1629594	I don't know.
1629674	1632495	I watched a lot of South Park.
1633115	1634576	I went to work.
1634816	1635436	I slept.
1636016	1638677	It was very uneventful, but it was good.
1638717	1643318	Sometimes, ironically, the boring weeks become the better weeks sometimes.
1644798	1648179	I have a small little thing to add on to what Christopher just said.
1648199	1648299	Yeah.
1649286	1657949	Now, don't ask me why I was watching UPN, but for some reason UPN was on the TV, and apparently UPN is getting South Park now.
1658569	1662090	And I'm like, what the hell would you want to watch South Park on UPN for?
1663430	1663951	You wouldn't.
1664351	1665091	Exactly!
1667232	1669292	Christopher, what else did you watch that rhymes with the 4400?
1669332	1669372	Um...
1672159	1673500	I don't know, maybe you can tell me.
1673680	1673780	The 4400.
1673920	1676241	Oh, yeah, that rhymes with 4400.
1676741	1677642	It's an awesome show.
1677722	1679422	I'm sorry, I forgot to add that to mine.
1679442	1683004	Oh, and Shane or Mikla Tav bought me Final Fantasy XI.
1683104	1684405	You can call him Shane, that's all right.
1684525	1687486	Oh, Shane, by the way, bought me Final Fantasy XI.
1687646	1693469	The listeners will just have to draw a chart at home to keep track of, okay, here's their online name and here's their real name.
1693769	1694189	Oh, okay.
1695670	1698131	And he got me into Final Fantasy XI.
1698171	1699852	Hooray, I converted somebody.
1701844	1702325	I helped.
1703025	1706507	Oh yeah, and I made Shane watch Mean Girls for the first time and he loved it.
1707007	1708248	It's an awesome movie.
1708488	1709368	It's really, really funny.
1711870	1713150	And today has been cool.
1714411	1714871	That's good.
1715431	1716592	I'm glad you're having a cool day.
1720628	1721348	My week and my day.
1721469	1724489	Actually, I had a pretty shitty week because I've been sick all week.
1724809	1726510	You can probably hear it now a little bit.
1726590	1733652	I know my voice is usually kind of nasal, but especially so tonight because I had a sinus infection this week, so it was pretty bad.
1734532	1739553	Weird enough, I'm pretty confident that I caught it on my plane ride back from the East Coast.
1740564	1741806	Thank you very much.
1761874	1763095	Coming back on the plane.
1763416	1764517	Yes, coming back on the plane.
1764557	1766959	I was pretty sure I caught my sinus infection there.
1767400	1769201	I did not get bit by a mosquito on the plane.
1769241	1770523	They don't let mosquitoes in planes.
1775868	1779131	Sorry, the profile of the mosquito matches that of a terrorist.
1779151	1780372	You cannot board the plane.
1783415	1783896	You guys.
1786488	1790769	So I got the sinus infection on the plane, but the symptoms didn't really set in until like Monday night.
1790849	1792310	So I was really, really sick.
1792390	1799312	And I went to work anyway because my job is kind of one of those where it's not easy for me to call in sick.
1799752	1802733	So, Extifer, yes, is reaching for a microphone, yes.
1803693	1805113	You can so call in sick.
1805133	1807114	There's so many people that can work for you.
1807174	1807514	You're just...
1808052	1814315	I don't know how things are going to be when I get back, and I might be creating more work for myself by calling in sick.
1814335	1814815	See what I'm saying?
1814835	1815475	See what I'm saying?
1830441	1831562	Take care of yourself first.
1831762	1832123	Whatever.
1832903	1833604	I took care of myself.
1833624	1834445	I slept all night.
1834705	1836787	That's why I have nothing to say about my weight because I slept.
1836967	1845595	I have to admit, when I go home and I see you in any pose sleeping on the couch, it's fucking hilarious.
1846335	1848077	Because you look funny when you sleep and you're sick.
1848976	1854059	Rob would also like to add that he will have something to talk about next week because he has Hello Kitty Roller Rescue.
1854079	1854479	I did.
1854539	1858921	Loki didn't buy me, but obtained me a copy through his work.
1859301	1861382	Not through pirating, actually, but through his work.
1861903	1864884	Obtained me a copy of Hello Kitty Roller Rescue, so I'm really excited.
1865084	1870167	And I have a reason to dust off the GameCube, since otherwise the damn thing wouldn't be getting dusted off until 2006.
1870447	1875250	Yeah, because my work looked at me funny when I was excited to get Hello Kitty Roller Rescue.
1876903	1879567	I'm all, yeah, I'm all, hey, my friend's gonna love this game.
1879587	1881170	They're all, right, your friend.
1886518	1886979	That's great.
1888510	1889331	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1908672	1910333	But I was really missing out on everything else.
1910394	1918961	But since I was living with Loki for the past couple years up until April, I was able to abuse his US PlayStation 2, so I never had to buy one.
1919481	1923265	But now that, you know, Extifer isn't quite the gamer I am.
1923345	1925066	Extifer, do you have any game systems?
1925106	1931892	What do you... I have a GameCube that I love and that I never play either.
1932613	1935275	So we let you on the show because you are a gamer, believe it or not.
1935683	1938225	I have played a video game before.
1938726	1939406	Okay, that's good.
1939687	1940968	What are your favorite GameCube games?
1943370	1944611	Metroid Prime.
1945051	1945772	There you go.
1946052	1946393	All right.
1947774	1950656	Now, what did I tell you to say every time somebody brings up Final Fantasy XI?
1951497	1953599	Damn those gil-sellers.
1954259	1954580	Gil-sellers.
1954620	1955721	Gil-sellers.
1955741	1956261	There you go.
1956982	1957762	Them gil-sellers.
1957803	1958964	They sell gils all the time.
1960965	1961586	What's a gil-seller?
1965043	1969364	What's one of the people that sells the currency on eBay and fucks up the economy?
1970464	1971345	Oh, well, damn them.
1971965	1973085	There you go.
1973685	1975066	So you just have a GameCube, nothing else?
1975646	1984268	I have a GameCube and a Game Boy Advance, and I have PlayStation 2 games, and I don't have a PlayStation 2, but you have one, so hey.
1984288	1984728	I have one now.
1984748	1985869	You have a tiny one.
1986149	1988109	Yes, I bought one of the new minis.
1988309	1989670	I was going to... Go ahead.
1989810	1990330	No, no, no, go ahead.
1991246	1995887	I was going to get an old-style PlayStation 2, but they're kind of hard to find now.
1995947	1997248	It's because I wanted to put a hard drive in it.
1997668	1999868	But I just decided, you know, fuck it.
1999888	2003409	Most PlayStation 2 games are like $20 now, and there's only a few I want to play.
2004509	2006570	You can still have a hard drive in the mini ones.
2006850	2007150	How?
2007770	2008330	Not in it.
2008951	2010511	Well, USB Advanced.
2010991	2012632	You can use the USB hard drives.
2012832	2018393	It supports up to 2TB hard drives, and it'll run just as fast as running off the CD-ROM.
2018911	2019231	DarkSakura,
2044318	2047660	Now, too bad you didn't wait, though, because it's dropping down in price to $99.
2048140	2049961	But not until November.
2050702	2052082	Yeah, to compete with Xbox 360.
2052122	2053243	I saved my receipt, just in case.
2053483	2054003	Hey, Rob.
2054023	2055965	He has to be killed off.
2056845	2058406	Those PlayStation 2s aren't new anymore.
2058426	2059667	They've been out for a year.
2059687	2062508	They're new to me, because nobody I know has one, except me.
2063349	2064689	Oh, but they're still not new.
2065570	2066190	They're new to me.
2066690	2067571	I don't care if they're not.
2067931	2071693	Hey, and the Xbox 360 is cool, because it's going to have Final Fantasy XI.
2071713	2072474	That's why I'm getting it.
2074105	2075526	Which one did you get?
2075586	2079427	I'm getting the one that's worth the money, not the one that's a $300 doorstop.
2079487	2082728	I love how you come on this program to promote non-Kanami games.
2083909	2085329	Yeah, like Pump.
2087430	2089811	We'll get to your Pump story, don't worry.
2089831	2090471	Hooray.
2090751	2091292	We'll get to that.
2093112	2095013	So, I bought my US PlayStation 2.
2095469	2096490	Final Fantasy X Final Fantasy X
2125316	2125636	One of them.
2148018	2150600	Are there any British soccer player games that we can talk about?
2150820	2153102	Because they're downstairs right now, I just saw them outside.
2153742	2155544	Anyways, I have to go see them again.
2156584	2158225	Winning 11, you can talk about winning 11.
2158265	2159566	We can talk about winning 11, I don't know.
2160527	2162128	Alright, go have fun next to her.
2164570	2164830	Alright.
2165791	2173637	Anyway, I guess what we'll do now, why don't we go to a quick break, then we're going to come back and talk about some actual Bomani news, things that are going on in the Bomani world.
2174357	2175338	Yes, let's.
2176120	2204095	and then we'll also open up the skype line a little later on in the show so you guys if you have anything you want to ask Miklatov or us you can because I'm sure folks are going to try and get some information on Miklatov even though he ain't going to tell you anything but you can try so we'll open up the skype line for you guys a little later on so if you guys want to be able to call on the show you have to head on over to our skype line www.orangeloungeradio.com and click on interact with us
2205074	2210105	and meanwhile we'll do some more announced music for DDR Extreme 2.
2210205	2212490	Started off with a little bit of Boom Boom Dollar.
2212650	2213412	We'll be back after this.
2471643	2484472	And the heat of the night, the night And the heat of the night, the night Why did our feelings die in action When we fought for satisfaction But our hearts end at the web Save me
2500727	2502570	Why, little love, all this magic
2565589	2571592	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 154 in progress.
2571612	2576654	We were talking a little bit about our weeks and our days.
2589090	2591971	Now we're going to talk a little bit about some things that are going on in the Bomani world.
2592651	2607594	I suppose, even though we've really just beat this topic into the freaking ground over the past few episodes, I think we sort of have to kind of say something about the recent developments in the Konami vs. Roxxor case.
2608735	2610295	Okay, basically here it is.
2610395	2613216	I'm just going to give you the short version, then you can say what you want, and we'll be done.
2614452	2627002	DDR Freak kind of used their account into the government public system, I think it's called PACER or something, to pull the latest documents in the case, because these are all publicly available documents.
2627062	2631765	It's not, you know, anything that's filed in a court of law, well, almost anything is usually publicly available.
2632185	2637069	So they basically pulled the official response to Konami's original claims.
2638350	2641953	Rock Sword responded to those on July 25th, so they went ahead and put those on their site.
2642593	2646856	And basically, in short, Rockstar says, we deny, we deny, we deny.
2647256	2650919	We request that Konami's patent on DDR be invalidated.
2651219	2654902	And that's part of a countersuit, which Rockstar went ahead with doing a countersuit there.
2655502	2657744	And then Konami responded on August 15th.
2658988	2664992	Nothing really earth-shaking there, just basically deny, deny, deny, you know, we'll see you in court type thing.
2665992	2668434	Also posted something called an order for discovery.
2668894	2677299	Kind of the most interesting thing in there, I think, as it was, because I don't profess to be a lawyer, so I'm not going to try and make sense of these documents.
2678840	2683783	But the order for discovery has like a timetable of what a possible trial would look like.
2684143	2686284	Get this, a trial date would be February of 2007.
2688140	2695006	So this Konami vs. Rocksaur bitching would go on well through, like, Extreme 4 and In the Groove 4.
2695886	2699349	So, we're screwed either way.
2700290	2703913	If you want to check this out for yourself, www.ddrfreak.com.
2703993	2706575	You can check out the original documents posted there.
2707816	2709818	Loki, did you check this out?
2710738	2711439	Yeah, briefly.
2711679	2711919	Yeah.
2714522	2719385	Please make it so Konami can't use their patents so we can steal it.
2721266	2721866	Hey, you know what?
2721906	2722747	In the group, guess what?
2722827	2727169	Rocks are... There's some modifiers that you don't have yet that are in Pump It Up.
2727229	2728310	Go steal those now.
2730564	2732525	would it be stealing though?
2732545	2748471	because now they're working with Andamira which I think would be really funny if those two companies end up merging shut up right now don't say such horrible things if those two companies end up merging before 2007 how's that going to screw everything up?
2748491	2759496	there's a little difference here watching you guys play Pump It Up today versus watching In The Groove it's like night and day the videos in Pump It Up
2760270	2761951	Phenomenal, the videos in the group.
2764812	2765972	There's videos in the group?
2765992	2766032	No.
2767373	2770014	Yeah, it's just some random crap.
2771254	2782979	Just the whole step charts, you know, that's, you know, granted, Pump It Up has some really retarded ones, like 17, you know, difficulty stuff, which, you know, in the group, you know, they're falling behind here.
2783039	2785199	I mean, they're a little ahead of you.
2785460	2787580	So, I don't know.
2788521	2789081	To be honest...
2789957	2792119	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2813651	2815593	and it has more songs and it's red.
2816153	2830123	I haven't gone to check it out but I have a good excuse because the arcade it's at is right on the same area or right on the same lot as the state fairgrounds and the state fair is going on right now so you can't get a parking space anywhere near the arcade so forget it.
2830203	2837968	I'm not going to pay ten dollars to go freaking park in the state fair parking lot and go to go play in the group two of all things.
2838128	2840930	I mean, oh yeah.
2841090	2842611	Even though I try not to
2843372	2845672	I just don't care anymore.
2845913	2846513	I really don't.
2846573	2847293	The game sucks.
2848293	2849033	That's the way I think.
2849153	2850533	You know, you love it.
2850713	2850973	Good.
2851133	2851674	You like crap.
2851714	2852834	Big deal.
2853194	2854134	I mean, you know what?
2854254	2855734	There are people that like crap out there.
2855754	2857074	I mean, I like bad movies.
2857595	2858995	Some people say, what the hell's wrong with you?
2859175	2860415	But, you know, I like bad movies.
2860495	2861315	I mean, what the hell?
2861835	2866236	So, if you like, you know, inferior games, if you think it's fun, hey, good.
2866416	2867196	It's your niche.
2867316	2870157	Obviously, someone's buying them, so somebody out there likes them.
2870617	2870817	Good.
2871617	2871697	Um,
2872935	2881519	Miklatov, now I know you really, really probably can't comment on these, because especially in your position, you'd be in a world of hurt, but is there anything you do want to say?
2881739	2883979	I'm taking off my Konami hat for a second.
2884040	2884420	Okay.
2884680	2886120	Okay, in the groove is stupid.
2887561	2894044	When I read the countersuit, I thought, you know, wow, you know, Rockstar's really taking a chance with four-year-old lawyers.
2895544	2899886	Actually, apparently, no, no, wait a minute, apparently now in the, um, uh,
2900851	2901993	I once went to a trial
2919264	2926649	But he says in the article that the Roxxor legal team is actually a pretty well-respected group from the Bay Area.
2926969	2932133	In the park, you know, in the little sandbox, when they have their little shovels and tails.
2933454	2934415	No, I'm sorry.
2934915	2937417	Everything Loki said is how I feel.
2937617	2943021	It's inferior, and Roxxor's just whiny because they want money off somebody else's game.
2943501	2944221	Now, wait a minute, though.
2944261	2944502	Here's...
2945782	2948923	I promised myself I wouldn't get into another lawsuit discussion, but I don't care.
2949043	2949864	I have you here, so.
2950364	2950644	Okay.
2952145	2957247	RockSore, you can look at as like the big corporate evil people that just want money.
2957427	2958427	They're not big.
2958747	2965750	Think about the people that actually made In The Groove, the team that actually made it before it got absolved into RockSore.
2966210	2970772	These guys were DDR fans that just took their obsession to a really extreme level.
2971272	2972113	Yeah, and you know what?
2972133	2983102	They could have kept it kind of on the download and small and not distribute it and sold it for money and tried to say, oh, it's better and oh, we're so cool.
2983142	2987586	We have somebody that uses different aliases also and all the songs sound the same.
2987606	2989367	You know, good or bad, okay?
2989507	2992129	Good or bad, whether whatever you think of in the group.
2992930	2993470	Let's put it this way.
2994331	2995212	DDR, okay?
2995572	3000236	If they were still making more mixes for the arcade, this would not have even been made.
3001069	3010073	And this game itself is so... I don't even know how they're saying that this is not even copyrighted on Dances Revolution.
3010593	3017156	Honestly, they changed everything, or what they thought they needed to change, so they wouldn't get sued.
3017376	3018056	That is all.
3018256	3022118	Otherwise, it is an exact duplicate of DDR.
3022518	3025559	Yeah, and what makes it better is, oh, Indie Groove 2 has DDR songs.
3027848	3029029	You know what's going to be interesting?
3029049	3029489	Yeah, I know.
3029569	3031790	I always thought that's very weird.
3031890	3034131	Why are they trying to copy DDR?
3034151	3035872	It's like, hey, we're getting away with this.
3035932	3039854	Now we're just going to put your songs in here, too, and make quote-unquote better steps.
3040154	3041175	Here's the interesting thing, though.
3041215	3041775	Imagine this.
3041835	3047278	Whether you're on the in-the-group side or on the DDR side or on the don't-give-a-shit side, picture this.
3047398	3051881	The jury trial that might happen if they don't settle might happen in 2007.
3053467	3055508	They're going to show a jury these two games.
3055828	3060549	This jury will not have a DDR or In The Groove fan on it, no matter what.
3060629	3068932	Because if people consider themselves a fan of that game, the lawyer from the opposing side is going to boot them off the jury, no question.
3069032	3071413	So there will not be any DDR or In The Groove fans on this jury.
3072193	3075434	You show somebody who isn't familiar with these dancing games these two games side by side.
3075574	3077215	They'll be like, that's the exact same game.
3078447	3081437	That's just all... Just draw your own conclusions.
3081918	3082379	Picture that.
3082440	3083744	That's where this could be headed.
3084185	3085329	That's why I'm kind of...
3086420	3090042	Surprise that we're not talking settlement yet, but maybe that's still a few months off.
3090483	3092864	They've got to whip their dicks out in the legal sense first.
3092884	3099729	I've heard some rumblings that's going to kind of change things from not the Konami side.
3100349	3102151	Oh, I was like, don't say too much.
3102191	3102971	No, no, no, no.
3102991	3104132	It has nothing to do with Konami.
3104372	3104632	Okay.
3104652	3109535	Yeah, if what I've heard goes through, I don't even know what's going to happen after that.
3110696	3111157	Interesting.
3111517	3111757	Yeah.
3112257	3112858	Very interesting.
3113458	3113738	Okay.
3114199	3115479	And I don't want it to go through.
3116920	3117361	at all.
3117961	3119062	Bye-bye.
3137130	3139711	That rumor's been going around ever since Andomero published.
3139731	3150413	Well, you know, I would rather see Andomero take on, you know, in the groove and actually be able to develop it, because obviously it looks like their programmers and game designers know what the fuck they're doing versus these guys.
3150474	3156375	I mean, these guys may have taken, you know, an okay direction, but Andomero's going to be the ones going to put the polish on things.
3156795	3163697	But the weird thing, if Andomero were to absolve Rockstar or whatever, Andomero and Konami kind of have that
3164964	3166925	They pay money to put out games.
3166945	3168405	Yeah, the games can coexist.
3168445	3171706	They basically have that these games can coexist agreement, whatever that may be.
3171886	3173527	That's why it's going to be weird.
3173747	3180149	Well, you know, it's weird, but hey, if they want to, you know, draw a truce or whatever, I'm fine with it.
3180169	3186231	You know, a little healthy competition never hurt anybody because it'd be an easy win for DDR, but you know.
3186638	3189199	So you're okay with In The Groove being out there and making new mixes?
3189300	3190280	I'm fine with it being out there.
3191121	3192541	If I don't like the game, I don't play it.
3192601	3193442	That's pretty simple.
3193502	3196704	I mean, it's not like I'm forced to play it when I walk into an arcade.
3196804	3198565	So, you know what?
3198985	3199785	I've played worse.
3200386	3201626	I've played worse games out there.
3201787	3207830	Hell, I've played a lot of dancing games that have just... I played that one game that was like Itoy Groove, okay?
3207850	3208891	That was an arcade game.
3209231	3210371	I mean, that game... I Can Dance?
3211172	3211812	Or I Can Boogie?
3212032	3212613	I Can Boogie.
3212873	3214474	That game sucks ass, okay?
3214514	3214834	This is...
3215743	3218285	In a whole new dimension of crap, okay?
3218785	3220987	That In The Groove would never ever be able to touch.
3222428	3227372	And I've played Dance Station 3DDX, which is really interesting.
3227392	3231835	You know, that one's a real weird game, but I found it to be pretty fun.
3232015	3233657	So, who cares?
3233937	3234798	Put another game out there.
3235058	3236579	Give some people some choice, you know?
3237139	3238761	Alright, alright.
3240222	3243284	Extifer, Justin, anything you guys want to say about this whole thing?
3243304	3243544	Nothing?
3244145	3244465	Nothing?
3246383	3248226	Xtifer's like, I don't know what you're talking about.
3250569	3251630	What do you think, Xtifer?
3251670	3254534	Well, okay, I'm actually curious of your perspective.
3254735	3256497	Have you seen the In the Groove game at all?
3257178	3259401	I did see it at the bowling alley.
3259742	3261424	Okay, now you're someone who doesn't...
3261957	3266020	I'm curious, as somebody who is not a hardcore fan of these two games, what do you think?
3266200	3267020	Is one game a rip-off of the other?
3267060	3267120	Um...
3285450	3290034	I think that in the groove game looked a lot like DDR.
3290074	3297040	I mean, it looked like the other game, but the only difference was they had those bombs or mines or whatever.
3298962	3300043	That was the only difference.
3300203	3301224	It basically was DDR.
3301885	3302185	I don't know.
3302245	3302746	That's what I thought.
3303026	3304607	See, now that could be what a jury member is going to think.
3304627	3306269	Isn't that interesting that I just said that?
3306289	3307290	Yes, it was riveting.
3307330	3307590	Thank you.
3308652	3321922	Well, sometimes I think folks that are hardcore fans of either In The Groove or DDR, you know, and have too much of a one-track mind where they only see the stuff they want to see in the games.
3321942	3332291	They don't kind of think that, oh, if this really does go to court, an unbiased jury is going to take a look at it and, you know, have their say.
3332891	3333151	All right.
3334092	3334933	Enough lawsuit chat.
3334953	3335273	I'm done.
3336527	3339530	I don't know why somebody would want that, but... No.
3339550	3340110	Do you know Noria?
3340130	3340791	Are you on a first name basis?
3340811	3344593	Like Sana and Togo and all them, they just walk around the office all day, right?
3364813	3366214	Maybe in Japan.
3367895	3370097	I mean, we occasionally get people in our office.
3370257	3372119	I don't ever remember seeing Noria.
3372779	3375901	And if I did, she'd probably come at me all crazy.
3376382	3380165	You have to understand that Naoki keeps a close eye on his harem, okay?
3380785	3381906	They don't leave Japan.
3385955	3389797	I remember the year that Akira Yamaoka came to E3 and you were just as excited as I was.
3389877	3393260	And I stalked him.
3393320	3394200	Three pictures.
3395181	3395681	That's great.
3397282	3397543	Anyway.
3399724	3400264	Let's do this.
3400324	3406449	Let's go ahead and... Actually, let's move to the Pump It Up topic since we were kind of getting into that a little bit and then we'll open up the skyline after another break.
3407669	3408170	Pump It Up...
3410413	3413054	Now, we actually, this game's not going to be out.
3413114	3415736	What's the official name of the game here we're looking at for Pump It Up?
3415756	3416776	Pump It Up Exceed Home?
3416876	3417877	Pump It Up Exceed.
3418197	3418897	Pump It Up Exceed.
3418917	3420698	The home release is coming out the 31st.
3421819	3425001	We got a copy, though, or I should say, Miklatov got a copy.
3425701	3427522	Now, don't forget to turn on your mic.
3428735	3430116	Heck yeah, I got a copy!
3431136	3432217	How did you get a copy?
3432437	3433918	Okay, it's a great story.
3434038	3435279	Was it through sources at Konami?
3435299	3435699	No, no.
3436399	3438981	Secret Andomero agreements where they share games with each other?
3439381	3446805	After work one day, I was like, hey, I want both pump-it-ups for Xbox and PS2 when they come out, because I know they're different.
3447145	3448706	I better go to EB and pre-order them.
3449047	3453869	So I went in there and I pre-ordered it, and the guy was like, hey, we got one traded in today, even though it's not out.
3453969	3454410	Do you want it?
3454450	3455690	I was like, heck yeah, I want it!
3455990	3456711	So I bought it.
3457011	3459232	How does someone trade something in if it's not out yet?
3459772	3460813	I don't even question that.
3461173	3463814	Is that DDR Stream 3?
3463914	3464794	Okay.
3465134	3471677	They're like, yeah, it doesn't come with the pad, and we're still charging you the price as if it were coming with the pad, but do you want it?
3471837	3473778	And I was like, I'll have it a month early.
3473998	3474899	Yeah, I'll take it.
3475679	3477380	So I'm just going to trade it in when it actually comes out.
3477400	3480241	But yeah, I've had the game since about the beginning of August.
3482600	3483121	XBOX Ver.
3483141	3483181	PS2
3504520	3505300	XSEED Arcade XSEED Arcade
3529767	3535129	and we also gained some of the revival songs from Exceed 2, which is random.
3536510	3545293	They censored a couple of the Spanish songs, which makes no sense to me, and that's about the only differences.
3545673	3547254	Okay, so tell us about, like, the unlock.
3547294	3548434	How do you unlock songs in the games?
3548574	3550295	I have no clue.
3550355	3553256	I've been playing that game since the beginning of August.
3553336	3558878	I've unlocked four songs now, or, okay, three, and then Justin unlocked one today, and, I mean...
3559458	3561620	If you think about it, there are four modes.
3562480	3569765	And to play songs in certain modes, like, say, I want to play... What's a song?
3570125	3573407	I want to play Chicken Wing in survival mode.
3573568	3574148	Okay.
3574408	3579311	Well, it's not unlocked in survival mode, so I have to play it in home mode just to unlock it.
3580092	3587357	And so I had to go through the game pretty much and play every song in every mode just to make sure that every song appeared in every mode.
3587417	3588798	And I don't even have that still!
3589458	3594262	So I've pretty much played over 400 songs, and I've only unlocked four songs.
3594742	3598125	But, along the way, you also unlock modifiers.
3598505	3605751	So, I mean, I've not been totally bored out of my mind playing the same songs over and over again.
3606592	3610215	I get random cool modifiers that are weird.
3610575	3612156	I like the one that was coming from the corner.
3612376	3613697	Yeah, exceed modifier.
3614098	3615119	It's very hard to read.
3615139	3620543	There's also one where it comes from the bottom middle and just kind of throws it all the way up and then to the side.
3621504	3624706	It also has something like break and something like wave.
3625547	3627549	It has random velocity.
3627649	3629230	You can change the arrow skins.
3630451	3635335	But, yeah, it's a pretty mean game to try to unlock songs in.
3635355	3637196	There's also a boobs and ass video.
3637316	3637977	Yeah, I mean...
3638769	3640591	I just thought I'd put that in there right there.
3640771	3647456	This game got a T rating, and you know, it censored two Spanish words, but there's a lot of breasts.
3647977	3649238	Lots and lots of breasts.
3650259	3651160	I don't understand it.
3651420	3652421	Like, not bare breasts.
3652581	3656324	No, but I mean, they smack her in the chin when she moves.
3656644	3658686	The whole video is about her breasts.
3659266	3663789	There's a lot of videos that look like internet flash videos out there, but... They're really funny.
3663809	3664449	Well, you know what, though?
3664549	3673074	I thought... One thing that really impressed me, really, really impressed me about Pump It Up Exceed on PlayStation 2 was the fact that every song had a unique video.
3673554	3678898	It wasn't some type of loop video, like all these little clips kind of looped over and over again.
3678918	3679638	It was like each one...
3679778	3680298	Rapper's Delight
3703913	3720878	and some of the actual music videos for actual songs Little Less Conversation Little Less Conversation, Name of the Game, and Walkie Talkie Man which is the stupidest song ever on Crazy it's a 17 tell us about where In The Groove might have gotten some of its inspiration from Pump It Up what?
3722008	3722989	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3747970	3750072	On Xbox Live, I don't know, it's just kind of weird.
3750092	3756017	Yeah, but I'll be happy because I can finally make steps to like songs that only have one set of steps.
3756317	3761241	And that's not even one set of steps for freestyle and normal, it's just like they only have normal steps.
3761321	3762522	And that's it, and they're like a two.
3763703	3770548	So, it's actually, the Xbox One is probably going to be the best one with song packs and that downloadable step editor.
3770568	3773911	Now, song packs on the Xbox One are going to be a little more expensive though, right?
3774031	3781573	Yeah, I don't think it's actually been officially announced, but they were tossing around the idea of $7 for three songs.
3781913	3783653	However, it would include licenses.
3783913	3789614	So, I mean, it's not like you're going to get... Hopefully, it's not like you're going to get just Banya songs.
3790294	3799196	You'll also get, like, I Hope to Goodness, Luzanka, or Fairy Boat, or Black Cat, or all those really cool songs from the really old games that don't show up anymore.
3799816	3802277	I was pissed off that Run to You was not in the song list.
3802878	3804563	Although the game does have a very impressive song.
3804583	3806750	Yeah, it's really amazing.
3806850	3807833	I couldn't believe it.
3808134	3808616	Alright, so...
3810442	3815644	Sum up the PlayStation version of Pump It Up Exceed, the good stuff and the bad stuff, and do you recommend it?
3815804	3819545	The good stuff is that it's Pump It Up, and it's the superior dancing game.
3821065	3836450	The bad stuff is that Mad Catz makes the pad, and that some of the steps are just utter crap, because there's no reason Walkie Talkie Man should go to every last little noise in the whole song.
3838271	3838891	Alright, the end.
3840119	3842589	I would say, I think that the game is...
3843598	3844999	Pretty good looking.
3845139	3846900	I think it's got a huge song list.
3846960	3850421	I love the fact that there's a unique video for every song.
3850461	3852262	I think it's just kind of a fun game.
3852682	3859306	I think some of the songs are kind of a little, like especially some of the Banya songs are a little average.
3859806	3863127	Yeah, Banya is very hit or miss, at least in my eyes.
3863187	3864748	But the K-pop stuff is pretty rad.
3864808	3868810	Oh, the K-pop stuff is great, and so is the pop because it's a lot of Latin songs.
3869010	3870631	And the regular pop stuff is cool.
3871371	3874454	So I was very surprised by Pump It Up Home Version.
3874614	3880078	I've gone from probably just not really interested in picking it up to I definitely want to pick this game up.
3881259	3883040	I think it's going to be really good.
3883180	3885202	However, the bad things about the game.
3885523	3889126	The interface still annoys the shit out of me.
3889226	3893729	I hate Pump's interface with the passion, and it is no better in XSEED.
3893849	3902095	Well, the thing is, it's based off the arcade one, and the arcade one has no, like, left and right buttons, so you have... Still sucks.
3902395	3906479	They could have done something else, I just, I hate the way you put in codes, I, bleh, sucks.
3907759	3911342	Well, that's why you can play in home mode, and then you can hold the triangle button down and just...
3915851	3916472	Always piss me off.
3916592	3918573	Anyway, it's not just that.
3918634	3922877	I just don't like the huge wheel that takes forever to get around.
3923238	3923538	I don't know.
3923778	3924819	That's just me.
3925319	3926480	It is.
3927101	3927441	I don't care.
3927802	3928943	Justin, what do you think?
3928963	3930744	Because I know you're a long-time DDR fan.
3930764	3932686	What do you think of Pump It Up on PlayStation?
3933006	3936489	I was very much like you when I first heard about it.
3936549	3938071	I was like, oh, it's Pump It Up.
3938151	3942795	I've seen that so many times at MGL and Swiggle, the local arcades.
3943234	3944275	and I just do not care.
3944295	3945476	Spiegel doesn't have it anymore.
3945596	3946417	MGL took it.
3946437	3948699	Let me fix that.
3948719	3949039	Okay, sorry.
3949119	3950220	That's my local arcade.
3951722	3961110	Anyways, but after playing it on Shane's copy, I found it was amazingly fun.
3961150	3968296	I love the fact that the videos are all fun and not just looped animations and they all have a sense of humor to them for the most part.
3969727	3970107	XBOX Ver.
4000037	4001478	Yeah, it looks like a great game.
4002078	4002258	Right?
4003018	4007401	Extifer, what little you saw of the game, what do you think of Pump It Up?
4008541	4011162	You know, I saw it as much as you did, I think.
4011342	4012663	Oh, I guess that's true.
4012683	4013924	I thought you left the room for some reason.
4013984	4014224	Okay.
4014704	4020447	Yeah, it seems like a game that I'll watch you play occasionally, you know?
4021207	4028871	I won't play it because I, you know, really suck at those games and it just looks really, I don't know, hard to play.
4031277	4031557	The End
4048882	4050923	I call bullshit until I play on one myself.
4050943	4051303	We'll see though.
4051323	4051583	Fine, whatever.
4051603	4052124	All right.
4078902	4083324	We're going to go to a break, you guys, and when we come back, we're going to take your calls on the Skype line.
4083344	4095188	We'll also talk a little bit about the tiny news we had in the... Well, actually, it was kind of major, but I think most of you guys have read about this by now, the Extreme 2 song list, as well as Karaoke Revolution.
4095768	4097889	Some song lists showed up for that as well.
4097909	4101731	So we're going to talk about all that when we come back from this break, and taking your calls on the Skype line, www.

4585073	4587395	Orange Lounge Radio, back at you here.
4587535	4596222	In that break, you heard a little bit of Sylvia Drive, Ninth Style, Injection of Love, Red, Inazuma, Happy Sky, Everyday Lovely Day, Eighth Consumer.
4597043	4599785	What are you booing Everyday Lovely Day for, Miglitov?
4599905	4600986	It's not a crappy song.
4601647	4602447	You're a crappy song.
4602948	4603228	All right.
4605094	4611279	We're going to open up the old Skype lines right now and take your calls here on our program.

4616042	4620366	Miklatov, I did get a question from somebody who is not able to call us on the Skype line.
4620766	4621907	Well, then they're losers.
4621967	4622708	But had a question.
4622748	4623308	It's Rene.
4623588	4625049	Well, I might not answer it then.
4625110	4626811	Well, Rene had a question.
4626851	4627251	What is it?
4627271	4627792	I need to ask you.
4627832	4628832	All right.
4629633	4633276	Basically, what he wants to know, is Konami doing anything...
4633857	4642402	for the fan requests on DDR Freak for new stuff, like new mods, new features in DDR, maybe songs.
4643022	4646284	When he says new mods, he's saying things like, you know, Wave, those types of things.
4646945	4649726	Has there been an official request for fan requests?
4651167	4655530	So, in other words, has there been something on DDR Freak asking you to say things?
4656590	4658071	I don't believe I've seen one in a little while.
4658703	4663126	Well, then, they're just requesting stuff that's not being heard.
4663647	4665128	Alright, alright, I gotcha.
4665568	4666208	Bye, John!
4666989	4667369	Alright.
4668150	4668450	Anyway.
4668630	4669150	Oh, goody!
4669210	4671692	The gay-straight ratio has gotten worse!
4673033	4676856	My friend John just showed up, so he's here now to further surround Loki.
4678021	4679402	We will make you gay by end of show.
4679422	4679942	No, I'm kidding.
4680002	4681643	I do have to say, though, I honestly don't know.
4683144	4698313	Usually when Konami wants to listen or really cares to listen, you'll see like a huge thread devoted to, oh, Konami's asking us to, you know, say, put this song in, so please list your songs you want in.
4698613	4699894	Do people now...
4700999	4703541	You don't have power over what goes in the game.
4716007	4722812	Do people that have the power to change what's in the game, do they read DDR Freak and those types of things?
4723772	4725894	I don't know who would actually have the power to change the game.
4726134	4726934	Yes, they do.
4727034	4728896	So keep making those pointless threads!
4733326	4740552	They love it when you make a, please put in Sakura, or please put in, what's another crappy song?
4741452	4742593	A crappy song!
4742633	4743474	Butterfly!
4744315	4746496	Oh, yeah, Cartoon Heroes.
4748278	4748618	Alright.
4750260	4757065	So keep making those pointless threads on DDR Freak with your requests, and maybe somebody from Konami will give a crap.
4757425	4757886	So we'll see.
4759131	4760332	Yeah, when we laugh at it.
4760352	4761393	You know what's going to happen?
4761673	4769719	When the head of PR or whatever is coming out to our company to speak about their games and stuff, I'm just going to say, can you put Sakura in the next one?
4769799	4773182	I have a controversial question for you.
4774485	4776687	I'm playing Meteos, what is it?
4777368	4779650	Do people at the office make fun of DDR Freak posts?
4780011	4781873	I have openly admitted I do.
4783835	4785136	Everybody knows I'm the jerk.
4785517	4789601	So, I mean, oh, last year, remember the extreme thread?
4789981	4791283	That was a big joke, it was fun.
4791303	4791783	You know what you need?
4791883	4796148	You need a giant plotter printer so you can print the thread or whatever the post is.
4796528	4799590	Super big on the wall so that you can laugh at it.
4799630	4803392	You know, you can just have, like, wallpaper on the wall with really bad posts from DDR3.
4803572	4806113	Ooh, I'm going to do that in my game room if I ever get one.
4807574	4808954	How come you guys didn't do clues this year?
4810075	4811095	I can't really say.
4811636	4812896	Oh, okay.
4812916	4813436	That's that.
4813817	4814817	That's all GamePro's fault.
4814977	4815658	All GamePro.
4815838	4816438	I got served.
4816458	4817378	Yeah, it's all GamePro's fault.
4817839	4818499	Let's go to a call.
4819279	4820720	Hello, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.
4823401	4823982	Hello, my friend.
4824022	4824482	What's on your mind?
4825782	4826922	Well, let me see.
4827023	4829444	Just, you know, going through the usual on a Sunday.
4830024	4835426	Me heading out to Long Island to play 2DX and breaking another in the group machine in the city.
4835746	4836766	Oh, that reminds me.
4836907	4843149	I have news for you because you were wanting me to come to the Digital Life Expo and you're actually not the only person on the East Coast who wanted me to come out there.
4844810	4849512	I'm having a meeting with my boss next week to negotiate trying to get the time off to make that happen.
4849652	4851633	I already have a place to stay if I come out there, so...
4853190	4854392	The plan is being set in motion.
4854452	4855292	I was serious last week.
4855333	4856334	I'm going to try and make it happen.
4856494	4857595	So, we'll see.
4857995	4868987	It all depends on... If anything, if you're still having problems with like, you know, finding a place to stay for other people, there's this cat named, you know, Sketch on the New York forums.
4869167	4875253	He's usually very... He usually offers his apartment for people who are actually going to be in the tournament.
4875293	4875474	So...
4876656	4886878	Don't take my word for... I mean, don't say I, you know, don't say I was, you know... Wait a minute, you... You want me to stay at the house of a complete internet stranger?
4887618	4890979	No, but I've already met him on... What if he rapes me or something?
4890999	4892559	That would be... You would feel bad.
4893399	4894480	You wouldn't feel anything.
4894560	4896060	But he's very generous.
4896500	4898000	I'm teasing, I'm teasing.
4898400	4899761	I'm sure this guy's great.
4899901	4905602	It would just be like you sitting down... Expert, shut the hell up.
4906363	4913272	Beans, can you spill for us about any more Konami stuff that you might know that's unclassified?
4914333	4917718	Unclassified Konami stuff that you might know, Miklatov.
4919739	4922340	Put down Minios for one goddamn minute, Jesus.
4922520	4923641	I like the demo.
4924901	4927963	Any unclassified Konami stuff that you can speak of.
4928083	4929044	Unclassified?
4929064	4932245	You know, things that won't get you fired for your NDA.
4932465	4936648	Well, I take lunch at, like, between 1 and 3.
4937568	4938809	So that's not going to get me fired.
4938829	4940450	That's making sense besides you.
4941570	4941850	What?
4942371	4942691	What was that?
4943693	4945435	Who else is making steps beside you?
4945455	4947657	Sorry, you got to excuse the retainer.
4947858	4948498	Can you say that?
4948538	4950701	Who else is making steps beside you?
4951142	4961254	I won't name names, but if you look at the instruction booklet for Ultramix 2, the names pretty much haven't changed.
4961989	4963270	Extreme 2 Are the chefs going to be horrible?
4980959	4985160	I just hope they're challenging too, because I don't want to be forced to make an edit.
5008195	5010537	Well, nobody's forcing you.
5010577	5016042	You could go play in the groove, and then you could use your hands and your feet and your butt and your head and your neighbor.
5016503	5019726	Now, now, now, if you want some additional... Just so you can hit all the arrows.
5020046	5023069	Wait for the game to come out, Taku, then you can start the shit-talking.
5023109	5026071	If you want some hard stuff, you gotta play the eye-tway stuff.
5026111	5027353	Hands and feet mode is where it's...
5028673	5030694	I've done enough.
5031094	5037357	I think I've injured my hand just playing in the groove trying to do the holds.
5037897	5039098	I got a little bruised.
5049511	5051651	a wee bit of a letdown for some fans.
5051691	5053052	It was just crap, that's it.
5053112	5055232	No, no, Xtreme was good.
5055252	5057733	Most of the sets to the licenses were crap.
5057853	5058913	Hold on, Zaku, don't interrupt me.
5059053	5060293	Alright, don't interrupt me.
5061914	5066595	Does Xtreme 2 make up for the things that tick people off about Xtreme 1?
5066915	5069475	First of all, I think those people are whiners.
5069755	5073716	There's no reason that I thought they were decent steps.
5073736	5074416	Wait a minute, though.
5074616	5078457	The fact that Konami held back, you know, on Xtreme, they held back...
5078837	5081618	Zaku, I will hang up on you.
5082418	5083558	Hold on, I'll get back to you in a minute.
5083599	5086799	Alright, which was the better game last year, Ultramix 2 or Extreme?
5086819	5088100	Ultramix 2, everybody knows that.
5088240	5089440	Okay, well then there you go.
5089500	5095122	I'm just defending Extreme, because people belittle it because it wasn't the Japanese one.
5095462	5098223	Oh my god, the steps are too easy because they're not 12s.
5098483	5103104	I think people were a little harsh on Extreme, but it did have its issues.
5103124	5104265	Yeah, I know, I know.
5104285	5105385	Maximizer was cool.
5108510	5111271	Interface, we all know that that's better now.
5111751	5122295	Songlist, we've seen hecka more transplants from Xtreme, like, you know, Irresistible Man, La Copa De Vida, all those Xtreme songs you wanted are in Xtreme 2.
5122395	5123516	Cartoon Heroes, hello.
5125677	5130158	The fact that they nailed, you know, they nailed Silence was pretty much it.
5130999	5131799	Your phone's ringing.
5132572	5135474	Yes, I know, so I'm going to wrap this up right now.
5135814	5140517	Bottom line is this, I just hope Xtreme 2 is a lot better than Xtreme.
5140598	5140898	It is.
5140938	5141658	Duly noted.
5141758	5143820	I've got to get this call.
5144140	5145521	Take care, Cool Cat.
5148983	5149364	Alright.
5150484	5151865	Go get that phone, don't be rude.
5152746	5155648	Alright, I'm trying to read what's going on in the chat room here.
5155708	5155908	Alright.
5160745	5163407	Are the steps going to still suck because you're working on them?
5164907	5169110	Oh, burn, yeah.
5169170	5173772	I have stuff I wasn't proud of in 2, and I have stuff I'm not proud of in other things.
5173832	5181456	As long as Konami of Hawaii can learn how to cut songs, you know, actually be able to edit them like, I don't know, Skulk, for example...
5182546	5192697	You know, as much as I thought I hated the edit for Skulk, I don't mind it anymore because there's... I don't think I'd want to be dancing to... Dancing?
5193338	5198183	Stepping on arrows to the part where he sings a lot, just because I don't think it would be that fun.
5198684	5200966	Granted, it was the same thing over and over again for the first episode.
5200986	5202267	I like the cut of Skulk, so you shut up.
5202908	5203108	Alright.
5205244	5206665	Damn, now I forgot the question I was going to ask.
5206685	5207925	I don't know what it was either.
5207966	5209226	Was it Meteos related?
5209246	5209987	Because that's what I'm doing.
5210027	5211708	No, it's not Meteos related.
5211748	5212589	It's back on Extreme.
5212609	5214070	I'm sorry to make you talk about work.
5214470	5216972	At least I'm not asking you about you know what.
5218853	5221615	What was I going to say about Extreme?
5221755	5225878	Oh, I don't know if you can answer this, so feel free to tell me you can't if you can't.
5226378	5232863	But we all know one of the reasons why people loved Ultramix 2 is because
5233561	5239215	DDR fans like yourself and other DDR fans who now work for Konami were responsible for the steps.
5240117	5241962	Extreme USA didn't have that.
5243376	5248019	Does Xtreme 2, now we all are assuming Ultramix 3 has it because you all worked on Ultramix before.
5248359	5252102	Does Xtreme 2 now have the influence of those same DDR fans?
5252222	5253243	I really can't say.
5253883	5254403	I knew that.
5254644	5256385	You just wanted to go back to Meteor pretty much.
5256405	5260227	So online stuff, are we going to, you know, is online going to be like pretty neat?
5260307	5266011	Are they going to do the same stuff they did with Ultramix 2 with Xtreme 2?
5266291	5267192	I can't say.
5267332	5269814	If it's not been in the press release, I really can't say anything about that.
5269834	5271095	It has been in the press release.
5271135	5272055	I just can't remember it.
5273776	5274377	Thank you for watching!
5303570	5304771	I don't see any more calls coming in.
5304871	5307233	Actually, you know, you could also go to MobyGames.com.
5308234	5311617	Credits for Ultra Mix 2 are listed there to see who worked on it.
5311737	5316021	If you don't actually have Ultra Mix 2, which if you don't, well, you're stupid.
5316662	5318944	Yeah, it was like five bucks at Walmart a couple weeks ago.
5319004	5320165	I saw some thread on DDR Free.
5320205	5321686	Yeah, I think that was a lie.
5322407	5322707	Was it?
5322767	5324529	I think that person was just stupid.
5324729	5325189	Bastard.
5325209	5326971	That's our most people on DDR Free.
5329293	5330314	Hey, watch it.
5330994	5333195	I have friends who are at DDR Freak.
5333215	5334996	They know I love them.
5335136	5338258	We have our lovely rewinds we do over on DDR Freak on Friday nights.
5338598	5339859	I forgot to pause Meteos.
5339959	5340559	I died.
5342220	5345442	That's what you get.
5346382	5351885	Seriously, this show is probably the most we've gotten out of Shane all year, and that's really not that much.
5352265	5353466	It really hasn't been that much.
5354466	5356247	We get more out of him if he is drunk.
5356407	5356928	Yeah, I know.
5357849	5358712	Anybody got some alcohol?
5359636	5360258	John, you're here now.
5360439	5361303	Go get him some alcohol.
5361544	5362668	John's gonna go get him some alcohol.
5364386	5366107	I'm not drinking tonight.
5366547	5367688	I have work tomorrow.
5368248	5369429	It'll be fine.
5370230	5372951	No, I'll punch somebody in the face if I'm hungover.
5372991	5375273	Didn't you say you were immune to alcohol now?
5376694	5377794	I say we test it.
5378015	5378995	I say we don't.
5379476	5380516	I say we do.
5383878	5386240	Yeah, see, I might have to throw up a lot or something.
5386260	5386820	Hurry up and call.
5386860	5390402	If you're thinking about calling, now is a good time to call because we're moving on.

5532254	5534095	Here's a little clip of that song if you haven't heard this yet.
5536336	5536877	That's the beginning.
5536897	5538938	Let me put it in the middle.
5545781	5547042	Wow, I picked the worst part of the song.
5547082	5547342	Here we go.
5562577	5566479	Alright, here's a little clip of Motorcycle with As The Rush Comes.
5566519	5571142	This song also going to be in DDR Extreme 2, USA.
5576104	5581447	Let's see if we can get some vocals here.
5581487	5582688	Let me skip to another part of the song.
5583508	5584949	You know, I think I have this CD.
5593481	5595802	I think you did, I think you did.
5597042	5601444	Delirium, of course, God, if you guys haven't heard this song, get out of your cave.
5602144	5605625	This is the particular remix of Silence that's going to be in DDR.

5617549	5619089	There's some little clips there for you guys.
5620110	5621470	Alright, um...
5622154	5648767	and let's see if you guys want to look at those sound clips for yourself I'm going to be so kind as to post a website where those songs are so go look them up and it's actually the full songs so if you want to listen to them the full songs are there so www.orangeloungeradio.com click on chat and I just posted the link right there if you guys want to check that out but don't stop listening to us because we have the Orange Lounge Radio cage match to take care of does that sound like a plan?
5649627	5651308	sounds like a plan alright
5651710	5656433	And even DarkSakura submitted a song to Cage Match tonight, even though she's not here yet.
5657874	5680127	Alright, the way the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match works, we're going to play three songs for you guys, one as chosen by each host of Orange Lounge Radio, and the winning song will go into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's Bomani Music and More program, featuring DDR and video game music all week long.
5680495	5684078	So, Loki won the cage match last week, and Loki, what was the name of your song?
5685659	5690002	Um, it was... Something from, uh, Wave of, or Wipeout.
5690022	5698168	It was Wipeout Pure, um, it was like, on, wasn't it like Onyx with something, um, god, I can't remember what the name of the song was.
5698428	5700529	I'm still looking for it, I gotta find this here somewhere.
5702070	5704052	I, I just don't remember, it was a cool song though.
5706109	5708571	Well, I hope so, because... Well, I don't remember the title.
5708611	5710793	I just remember, hey, it's a song from Wipeout, you know?
5712014	5713676	Well, that's not good, because I can't find it suddenly.
5713696	5714316	Do you have your drive?
5714377	5716518	I think it began with an A. I can't remember.
5716538	5717820	Do you have your drive, by chance?
5717900	5718500	Nope, I don't.
5718760	5719421	Oh, we're fucked.
5720602	5721103	No, we're not.
5721443	5723765	Search by Modified.
5724185	5724766	It'll pull it up.
5726397	5727658	X-Files meets X-Men, so it's really cool.
5756478	5758940	I love it and I'm crazy addicted to it.
5759380	5761501	And you can go buy the first season on DVD for $20.
5761601	5763823	Where at?
5764643	5766444	Any place that sells that DVD.
5766704	5766804	For $20?
5767164	5767565	For $20.
5770046	5772768	I got mine at Fry's, but I saw it at Suncoast today.
5772968	5773268	It's still $20.
5773368	5774749	And it's worth it.
5777299	5779120	Not to make fun of, shut up, John.
5779441	5780221	It's a really good show.
5851169	5851910	Thanks for watching!
5903138	5908003	All righty, that was song number one in tonight's cage match, last week's winner after having to dig that one up.
5908043	5910085	That was Cold Storage with Onyx.
5910525	5912387	Will it win for another week in a row?
5912427	5913088	We'll find out.
5913108	5916571	But first, we have to put it up against two brand new songs.
5916952	5919614	So the second song in tonight's cage match is going to be my pick.
5920195	5925540	And you guys remember DJ Sammy, he was really huge a couple years ago with that song Heaven, you know.
5930231	5935674	And it was in DDR Extreme, DDR Max 2 and everything, so I know you guys know it.
5936114	5939376	Well, he has a brand new single out, brand, brand new single, and it's another cover.
5940036	5942658	So guess what song he decided to take a spin on this time.
5942698	5944239	It's actually an old Annie Lennox song.
5944899	5948461	It's his version of Why, and it's my pick for tonight's Cage Match, song number two.
6021990	6024296	Thanks for watching!
6085491	6087516	Thanks for watching!
6121744	6122425	Thanks for watching!
6190020	6190481	Y by DJ Sammy
6202819	6203579	Why?
6205380	6212363	The part where she's doing the ad-lib vocal stuff, not the refrain.
6212383	6213123	Where she's rapping?
6213863	6215344	Sorta, I guess, rapping.
6215424	6217625	That just totally did not work at all.
6217925	6220566	It was really bad in that sense.
6221586	6225588	And DJ Sammy needs to make some new songs that are not covers.
6226474	6228335	Please, please, please.
6228616	6230277	Or pick some better 80s stuff.
6230317	6231958	I mean, there's plenty of songs out there, you know.
6232198	6234480	Personally, I like, you know, West End Girls.
6234520	6235441	You know, that's a good song.
6235481	6237302	They did a really cool breakbeat version of it.
6238583	6238883	Awesome.
6239224	6241706	But, um, that wasn't quite awesome.
6241746	6242826	It was about 7.
6243927	6244287	Alright.
6245148	6246849	Miklatov, what did you think of that one?
6247530	6248290	He's got his own mic.
6248631	6249531	Alright, hand him that one, that one.
6250312	6250392	Um...
6252307	6256250	Yeah, I didn't really care for this song because I was playing Meteos.
6259151	6266536	I still, I heard it though earlier today and it's okay, but I, oh crap, I forgot to pause.
6269198	6269998	I give it a four.
6270018	6273360	Alright, Justin.
6274221	6280645	I give it a six because like Loki, I really was not digging the part where she was just kind of talking the song and not
6281444	6291986	I don't even like Annie Lennox that much.
6292366	6295867	She's like a weird fucking red-headed bitch.
6296947	6298067	But she's British!
6298187	6299167	I thought you liked that!
6300848	6308809	You know, I like Imogen Heap because she's cool and British, but Annie Lennox is weird.
6310027	6313528	I don't know, like, I didn't like the original song, so I didn't care for this one either.
6314328	6315209	It's a scale of 1 to 10?
6315329	6316269	Is that what it is?
6316509	6316729	Yes.
6317089	6317329	Okay, 1.
6318870	6319350	John!
6320010	6321711	For your debut on the show, John.
6322211	6323331	Wow, this is kind of scary.
6323692	6324292	What'd you think?
6324872	6326372	I was kind of bored with it, to be honest.
6326392	6327193	I give it a 3.
6327973	6328233	Alright.
6328866	6341229	And I give that song... I agree, the girl rapping was kind of weird, and it doesn't hold a candle to the Annie Lennox original, but it makes me think about the Annie Lennox original and why I love that red-headed bitch from the Eurythmics.
6341629	6343329	So I give it a 20.
6344250	6347010	Alright, let's go to the next song.
6347490	6350031	This is... You're a red-headed bitch, that's why.
6351280	6353161	This is DarkSakura's pick.
6353221	6354682	She put a song in tonight's cage match.
6354742	6357464	Even though she's not here tonight, she's actually in chat.
6357504	6360045	She just joined the chat room, so you guys can say hi to her over there.
6360466	6363147	I think she'll be here in a little while before podcast.
6363167	6364288	I think she's supposed to be anyway.
6364568	6364928	We'll see.
6365369	6367130	But she put this song in for you guys.
6367690	6368851	It's an old favorite.
6369691	6374294	It's Hamasaki Ayumi with Fly High.
6374394	6376536	And it's Hal's 2000 mix.
6379448	6384190	So here it is, you know her, Ayumi Hamasaki, what?
6384971	6386871	What are you shaking your head for over there, Loki?
6388112	6389113	Let's play the song!
6390753	6392014	Alright, here we go.
6393395	6396296	Ayumi Hamasaki, Fly High, Hal's 2000 Mix, here it is.
6419182	6420364	and the rest of the band.
6447486	6448446	Thank you for watching!
6486844	6487190	and many more.
6519162	6520823	Thank you for watching!
6573891	6575058	Thank you for watching
6654233	6660161	Alrighty, that was song number three, Ayumi, the one and only, with Fly High, Hal's 2000 mix.
6660241	6667550	Let's go around and see, on a scale of one to ten, where that song lies for the folks in our studio right now.
6667730	6667991	Loki.
6668011	6668091	Loki.
6668442	6673084	You know, I want to start off by saying that it was generic trance, but, um... You're gonna get punched next week.
6673104	6674004	But, you know what?
6674724	6677945	That was just a clusterfuck of... No!
6678345	6678846	No!
6679146	6679426	No!
6679526	6680866	Bad song.
6681046	6681947	Bad.
6682307	6683007	Bad.
6683467	6683927	Bad song.
6684748	6684868	One.
6685088	6685488	I'm sorry.
6685588	6686448	It was awful.
6686548	6689229	And then I thought it was gonna end, and I was like, oh, thank God.
6689749	6691210	It came back, and I was like, no!
6692455	6693256	Wow, very, very bad.
6693696	6698380	I, you know what, me personally, I don't get to go to the last, we gotta go in the same order.
6698400	6699741	Shane, you're up next.
6700741	6711670	Okay, my first comment when that song was playing, and we didn't have microphones on, was, wow, I didn't know Inuyasha was over, because it sounds like an anime song that I don't care about.
6711950	6721778	Um, one, because I don't understand the love of Japanese singers and how they're so cool, and Ayumi Hamasaki, and
6724146	6724986	All right.
6725046	6725847	Well, let's see.
6725967	6726447	Let's move on.
6726467	6726827	Justin.
6728567	6739430	Even though it was a complete clusterfuck of a different, like, it went through rap, it went through happy J-pop, it went through generic trance, and it went through hard trance, I still kind of liked it.
6739990	6740830	So I give it a seven.
6741090	6741430	All right.
6742310	6742890	Extover.
6744571	6745671	Damn those guild sellers.
6748314	6749515	I got it right that time, right?
6749555	6751355	Yeah, you did, but that's not the topic.
6751635	6753015	Oh, I'm sorry.
6753536	6755416	The song was so boring, I forgot.
6755896	6761758	Oh, no, I love Jamie, so I'm going to give it a five just for that.
6762198	6762538	Okay.
6763398	6763838	John.
6765038	6767039	I'll just say that Loki's song was my favorite.
6768019	6770200	Oh, okay.
6770220	6771680	That's not a number on a scale of one to ten.
6772644	6774745	DarkSakura is actually listening and she would like to say the following.
6774765	6778227	Mine gets an 8 and not a 10 because it's still generic trance.
6790031	6794515	So at least she's acknowledging that it's a wee bit of generic trance.
6794695	6795656	You know what?
6795676	6797757	That's my favorite Ayumi song, is Fly High.
6797937	6799358	So I was pretty excited there.
6799879	6806424	The only parts I didn't like about that song were the very beginning, and the very end, and the middle.
6806644	6807025	But like...
6809304	6816946	Not everything in the middle, like the rap in the middle I didn't like, but I liked the first two minutes around the beginning, and I liked the last two minutes after the rap.
6817266	6821047	So if we could cut, like crop the song, it would be really, really good.
6821448	6823648	But because it's not cropped, I have to give it a 7.
6824028	6826569	So, Loki, you have a...
6826917	6829699	It sounded like the end of a 2DX song.
6829880	6832602	I can't think for the life of me which song... Big Voyager.
6832722	6833843	Big Voyager, okay.
6833943	6838367	Yeah, completely ripped those public... I'm sure they're royalty-free samples.
6838387	6842130	They're available on some CDs somewhere because everybody uses them.
6842870	6844192	I have some of them, so I know.
6845072	6847214	All right, kids.
6847274	6848415	Get ready to place those votes.
6848455	6851658	Here's a recap of the three songs you can vote for in tonight's cage match.
6851718	6855181	Song number one is Cold Storage with Onyx.
6863270	6870953	And song number two you can vote for tonight is DJ Sammy with his Annie Lennox cover of Why.
6880537	6887040	And song number three you can vote for tonight is Hamasaki Ayumi, Fly High, Howl's 2000 Mix.
6898108	6900631	Place vote now.
6900671	6902153	Do you like how I got the big Voyager clip in there?
6902834	6904517	Place vote now.
6904557	6908382	Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.
6909144	6910984	Jamie, I'm already going to tell you, your vote doesn't count.
6911004	6911685	I'm sorry to say.
6912305	6912625	All right.
6912965	6913445	You know what?
6913605	6923407	It kind of reminded me, like, parts of that Ayumi song reminded me of, like, a Max Ayumi or something like that, you know, because they have the clips of, like, some hard techno stuff, and then it went back into Ayumi.
6923427	6924448	It's just kind of weird.
6924908	6926028	Yeah, it was interesting.
6926208	6926688	It was interesting.
6926708	6927348	It was interesting.
6928208	6931949	All right, this is the part of the show where I let Loki talk about what's going on in the sim scene.
6932970	6938131	Well, I'm sure there's something going on at Tourney Mix 6, but I haven't checked, so it's going on.
6939574	6969126	then there's also the important thing because we're talking about quality sim files now is actually FoonMix 2 they have a date for it now when it's going to be coming out September 15th and they've announced some of the compilations they're going to be pulling from from you know diverse system stuff to Silly Walker stuff and they're basically I think they mentioned like D7 which was some really good stuff in there and then some of the Silly Walker Gotta Mix 3 or something like that
6970149	6971029	Really good songs.
6971150	6972311	So, it'll be interesting.
6972331	6974012	I think they said over 50 songs.
6974893	6975394	50 new songs.
6975514	6977355	So, I can't wait.
6977976	6981880	It looks to be fun and we'll have to check it out on the 15th.
6983381	6983581	Alright.
6984842	6987025	Justin, I know you follow the sim scene a little bit too.
6987085	6988066	Is there anything you want to add?
6988106	6989267	Because Loki tends to miss things.
6989707	6989927	Yeah.
6991521	6999124	Actually, one of my favorite personal Simphile authors, the DWI Extreme series just released one of their new mixes too.
6999184	7002646	It was DWI Extreme Glistening to Infinity.
7003486	7007148	Lame name, I know, but it was actually a really good mix of songs.
7007168	7014431	They had some Latin songs, they had a bunch of R&B and dance songs, and it's actually a really good mix.
7015171	7020253	But the thing is, for this specific release, they're actually making it
7021172	7021993	They're still dead.
7022013	7022413	Who cares?
7022433	7023934	Princess Diana is still dead.
7050489	7051610	Just in case you're wondering.
7055612	7056472	Princess Di.
7060435	7061175	How rude.
7061195	7072722	I would have loved to see, you know, the actual, you know how they always have those funny, witty, you know, subject lines, you know, they're always on the newspapers, you know, the wonderful headlines.
7073222	7078205	I wish, you know, there was a newspaper that put Princess Di, you know, D-I-V, because that'd be funny.
7079284	7081705	You know, you might be really offending somebody who's listening tonight.
7082145	7083566	But isn't that what we were good at doing?
7083966	7089109	Well, you know, if I'm offending Princess Di, then they shouldn't, you know... She's probably rolling in her grave.
7089829	7091030	Hook her up to an alternator.
7091910	7092871	Generate some power that way.
7097053	7098654	Let's change the subject, shall we?
7102596	7106598	Some folks still wanted to call in on our Skype line.
7108459	7110400	So I'm going to go ahead and open the Skype line back up.
7110440	7113401	It's available at www.OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
7114201	7120603	Click on Interact With Us, and you too can join in on the fun here on OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
7120924	7124425	So I'm going to give them just a couple minutes to get in.
7124465	7126546	Now's your chance on the Skype line.
7126966	7132508	In the meantime, I wanted to mention this because Rini linked me to this.
7132628	7134348	Hold on, our caller's having problems getting in.
7135729	7135929	Okay.
7137526	7138647	A couple minutes to get in.
7138687	7143110	That sounds like, you know, Ann Nicole Smith boarding a plane, you know.
7143170	7146673	It's like, come on, I'm ready for you.
7154879	7166869	Anyway, I'm supposed to mention this thing that Rini linked me to, and I think this came off of the DDR Freak forum somehow, and it's basically the, or it's actually linked to on
7168376	7171418	Konami of USA's website for Extreme 2.
7171939	7175321	There's actually an online user agreement and you can read all these details.
7175361	7178063	It's basically the blah blah blah blah blahs about the game.
7178543	7190412	Well, somewhere in here it mentions in the blah blah blah something about this online game does not have any automatic save feature and therefore will ask you to save your information to a memory card or hard disk drive.
7190932	7195535	So people are saying like, OMG, this game might have a hard disk drive support on it.
7196156	7196336	So...
7197344	7197684	I don't know.
7198044	7205168	I tend to think this is just some generic agreement that happens to have Konami's name inserted in there.
7205389	7205869	But we'll see.
7205969	7209491	Hey, turn down your speakers, buddy, and you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
7209911	7211532	Yo, Sky, what's up?
7212092	7212573	Hey, who's this?
7212833	7213273	Hey, who's this?
7213933	7214714	It's Kuwabara.
7215434	7216335	Hello, Kuwabara.
7216415	7217555	I'm hearing myself.
7217696	7220317	Can you turn down your speakers or move the headphones or something?
7220417	7223119	Yeah, sorry, it's a built-in mic.
7223439	7224179	I'm actually fine.
7224599	7225480	Oh, that's all right.
7226277	7230079	Well, give us your thought, because I'm hearing myself, so give us your thought and then we'll respond to it.
7230099	7232420	Thought on what?
7233460	7234361	Why you're calling in tonight.
7235841	7239103	I just wanted to call in just to, you know, talk about stuff.
7239163	7240643	I really like 2DX and stuff.
7241224	7244445	Just because, you know, I want to change the subject from ITG and DDR.
7244525	7246326	It's starting to piss me off.
7246786	7252329	Okay, well, what is it you want to say that's not ITG DDR related?
7252349	7252929	DDR related.
7254721	7256082	I don't know, I really love Noria.
7257983	7259224	You love what?
7259665	7261045	Noria.
7261286	7261846	Noria?
7262006	7263207	That's 2DX related.
7263847	7264868	Extifer?
7265568	7265969	Echo.
7266909	7271532	Stop it!
7271873	7273974	I played a Noria song for you last break.
7273994	7276536	Yeah, I know, that was really nice of you.
7276716	7277756	Alright, no problem.
7277997	7279718	What's the thing you like most about 2DX?
7281499	7283120	I like 2DX because of the key sounds.
7284090	7284811	The Key Sounds
7314454	7315857	Oh wait, can you say that?
7316097	7318982	Oh, never mind, okay.
7319303	7322048	Well, it's our turn, dammit!
7325054	7325634	Alright, Miko, what's up?
7325654	7325895	Hurry up.
7326035	7326395	Miko, what's up?
7326415	7326615	Hurry up.
7326795	7328316	Who says they're... Oh, crap!
7328336	7328997	That's loud!
7329337	7329677	Sorry.
7330257	7331538	Okay, I'll talk really quietly.
7331938	7336581	Who said that they're delaying TempStyle because of Beatmania US?
7336962	7341144	Uh, I just thought it up because, uh, you know, it makes sense, doesn't it?
7341425	7343206	Well, don't listen to your brain.
7344627	7347048	That's something Konami would do, though, wouldn't it?
7347068	7348009	I mean, it just makes sense.
7348389	7349290	Why would they do that?
7349310	7350631	Well, they got a lot of people working there.
7350671	7351831	That's not a nice thing.
7351851	7352632	That's not a nice thing.
7353703	7354423	Nami's nice.
7355404	7357685	Besides, they're working on, they have, you know, the U.S.
7357765	7359706	offices to work on Beatmania U.S.
7359766	7362948	and then you have the Japanese offices to work on Beatmania 2DX.
7364189	7368191	I don't actually think that's how it's working, but I don't think they're delaying anything.
7368211	7369452	Don't listen to your brain, you know.
7369512	7371513	Oh, yeah, that's right.
7371813	7376916	Kuwabara, I'm going to go ahead and let you go because we're getting too much of that echo, but thank you for calling in and have a great day, okay?
7377036	7377256	Echo.
7377276	7378677	All right, later.
7379881	7382043	Alright, so Skypline's still open.
7382243	7384445	DarkSakura, who's probably ticked off on me, but that's alright.
7384985	7386587	That guy got in first, what can I say?
7386647	7389849	Now you know what it's like to be one of our listeners, trying to get in on the Skypline.
7390030	7393112	If we took a picture just then, we would have an echo image.
7395614	7397076	OMG, was that a hint?
7397556	7398597	OMG, was that a clue?
7399097	7399638	Was that a clue?
7399658	7400939	Go back to the freak board.
7404722	7404982	Alright.
7406483	7408165	So, just because TenStyle
7408923	7416364	is, um, or I'm sorry, just because, I'm sorry, just because Beatmania US is being worked on doesn't mean that TenStyle is not being worked on.
7416424	7426726	And it hasn't even been announced yet, so who knows if they're actually even doing it, but the release of a US game would not stop the production of a Japanese game.
7426906	7428666	From the man on the inside himself.
7428746	7429867	Anyway, let's go to our Skype line.
7430167	7431087	Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.
7433967	7434407	Hello?
7434427	7436028	Uh, can you hear me?
7436268	7436968	Yes, now we can.
7437128	7437408	What's up?
7439879	7442460	Oh my god, what a day.
7443100	7446941	This is the one and only DarkSakura, for those that may not recognize the voice.
7446961	7448501	This is DarkSakura, ladies and gentlemen.
7449762	7450802	You too, say hi.
7451382	7451742	Hello.
7452523	7452703	Hi.
7453323	7454363	Hi, Dan.
7454523	7457804	There's a little bit of lag, DarkSakura, so just tell us about your day.
7459423	7464748	I spent all day at Classic Gaming Expo looking at a bunch of stuff that I wanted to buy.
7465529	7478200	And I found myself actually put into a position of translator for some guy at this booth selling a bunch of Famicom and Super Famicom and Mega Drive games and PC Engine Hu cards.
7479481	7484666	And I actually didn't get to go to any of the panels because I was busy dueling at stuff and looking at the museum.
7485602	7487683	which actually wasn't as impressive as it was before.
7487703	7489264	It's just all the same stuff.
7489905	7496348	But they're going to be taking a year off next year and coming back in 2007 and hopefully that's going to be bigger and better.
7496909	7501732	This year was kind of eh, but I got to meet the guys who run Retro Gaming Radio.
7502552	7503312	Cool.
7503633	7504313	Pretty big.
7506014	7508676	We actually had a pretty long discussion about Don Bluth.
7510677	7511377	Oh, okay.
7512738	7512818	Um...
7514173	7522616	I also got to meet this person who built basically a miniature Nintendo that runs the Famicom and Nintendo games.
7522936	7523896	I took some pictures of that.
7523916	7525577	They'll be up on the site in a few days.
7525757	7527037	Is that the same one from E3?
7529178	7532059	I don't remember because I don't think I saw him at E3.
7532199	7532479	It was...
7532935	7535837	Famicom Loader Front Loader Disk System
7554488	7555870	Doki Doki Panic Doki Doki Panic
7574347	7578888	The whole reason behind that, and it makes a lot of sense, is... What's the name of that thing called, Anne?
7605497	7629507	California Extreme California Extreme, that's basically replacing all of the big massive arcade of retro games They had more games this year and almost all of them worked They had a Millipede, Mousetrap, Gorf, Tempest Dude, Mousetrap is awesome That's why I love my ColecoVision There's a Mousetrap and Gorf Gorf, who plays Gorf?
7631721	7632501	Dinky Dinky
7661972	7663413	It was a different hotel this year, right?
7664513	7667255	Yeah, it was at the Hyatt and Burlingame.
7667975	7669496	Was that where the Life 365 Awards were?
7669516	7671496	I don't remember.
7671536	7672217	No, it wasn't.
7672237	7673157	It was a different hotel.
7673257	7675298	We were actually in San Francisco.
7675578	7676039	Oh, that's right.
7676079	7676419	That's right.
7677319	7677659	Okay.
7678880	7680120	But there were people there who heard of us.
7680881	7681241	Wow.
7682201	7682782	That's crazy.
7682842	7683342	That's kind of cool.
7684362	7687724	But I made some contacts.
7687784	7690245	We will be having more on that in the future.
7692304	7692584	Cool.
7694625	7700028	But, you know, I did, though, for the people who were there, they were the folks that were really into it.
7700128	7701848	Oh, by the way, there was a new Lego sculpture.
7702789	7703149	Of what?
7704169	7704730	Pac-Man.
7704870	7705430	I took a picture.
7705530	7706090	Oh, that's cool.
7707631	7714634	And for the Moby Games thing, Dan got place number four and got me a t-shirt.
7715094	7715955	Oh, cool, cool.
7716375	7717095	For the whole show.
7717115	7717315	Oh, wow.
7717375	7718236	For what game?
7723839	7725180	We have to name the screenshot.
7726080	7727281	Oh, I remember that thing.
7727441	7729783	Okay, I remember that.
7730063	7736747	What was the contest they had last year where we all had to play the Stampede on Atari?
7736987	7738348	Did they do something like that again this year?
7738629	7739229	Twin Galaxies?
7739269	7742631	I think that there was some type of game going on on a widescreen.
7743412	7751037	One thing, Rob, I think that you'll get a kick out of in the museum room, they had a jaguar hooked up onto their projector, and it was Tempest X.
7751687	7752067	Awesome.
7752408	7753128	Which was Tempest 2000.
7753808	7754129	Awesome.
7754189	7756050	Tempest is like my favorite Jaguar game ever.
7757651	7758892	Was 8-Bit Weapon back this year?
7759652	7760913	Yes, 8-Bit Weapon was back.
7760953	7768738	Unfortunately, I was sort of out of cash because somebody found the core graphics in Strider on the PC Engine Duo.
7769818	7770098	Dope.
7770659	7774901	So I would have picked up one of their CDs, but I think I still got their card from last year.
7774921	7775722	I meant to contact them.
7776595	7785062	There's also another person there just playing a bunch of game music on a keyboard.
7785102	7792208	Just somebody who was part of the show.
7793609	7803057	There was also, for the people who were there, the Atari people were back, of course Moby Games, the Intellivision folks were there.
7804463	7806924	Still whoring out that Intellivision collection from like three years ago?
7807704	7807964	Yep.
7808745	7814527	There's also a couple guys there who were selling MVS carts.
7814727	7824310	For anyone who doesn't know, the MVS cartridges are the Neo Geo games and homemade JAMMA units to play them on.
7825370	7830672	And selling like, you know... Whoa.
7831152	7831733	Oh, whoa.
7833922	7835503	Whoa!
7835603	7836503	Whoa, whoa, whoa.
7836963	7838264	Whoa, Jamie, hold up, hold up.
7838324	7840705	Jamie, your voice went like crazy there for a minute.
7840725	7846287	You sounded like an evil lord, a demon, from like an Atari 2600 game.
7846327	7848228	We gotta save that clip for the next intro.
7848268	7849128	That was crazy.
7850108	7852169	Start over again with that paragraph, Jamie.
7853250	7853490	Okay.
7854210	7861053	A guy there who was selling basically anything NEC, practically it was...
7861986	7874456	Duo R, Duo RX, Core Graphics, a bunch of Turbo Graphics, Turbo Duo Games, PC Engine Duo Games, Arcade Cards, you name it.
7874516	7875617	He had a bunch of good stuff.
7875637	7877638	We picked up like five HuCard games.
7881301	7885825	But his other main thing, though, is that he mods consoles.
7885865	7887947	He actually has basically regionless...
7889451	7898816	Duo Dittl Cell, because the one thing is that the Duo, the CD will read any region and has no problem with replicas.
7899616	7908741	However, the cards themselves are not universal and there's not any real good adapter, but he's modded a universal system for it.
7910001	7912643	And he does video mods, super guns, jamming units.
7912683	7917465	He actually has made this really tiny jamming unit for MVS cartridges.
7917964	7922245	I don't know if an explanation of those came through, but the MVS cartridges are the Neo Geo games.
7925766	7932989	I had wished that there were the modified cartridges to play on the AVS systems.
7933949	7941411	Also, again, the Intellivision people were there, like I said.
7941811	7944112	The people with the massive Atari stuff were there.
7944712	7946933	Expensive Lynx games, oh my god.
7947951	7956455	Um, but the booth that I liked the best, I'd have to say, was the, uh, the guy from Japan just selling stuff.
7956715	7958455	Oh, there's just a random guy from Japan selling stuff?
7959356	7965958	He was selling, uh, Famicom, Super Nintendo, um, cue cards, um, all kinds of stuff.
7966038	7968079	They were like five games for ten dollars.
7968099	7968760	That's cool.
7968780	7972441	So I picked up Final Fantasy II on the Famicom.
7972661	7973041	Cool.
7973061	7976803	Uh, Mappyland, in the box, on the Famicom.
7976863	7977123	Uh-huh.
7977143	7977363	Uh-huh.
7979513	7985155	Tuyo Pio for the Mega Drive and Legend of the Valkyrie for PC Engine.
7985215	7986695	That was $10 for all that?
7988135	7986695	$10.
7988195	7989736	You could make a killing for some of that on eBay.
7989756	7992896	It had a price tag of $20 on it.
7993176	7993497	Wow.
7993677	7995157	You could make a killing for some of that on eBay.
7996137	7997478	Yeah, but I actually want to play it.
7998298	7998718	Alright.
7998738	8000698	I don't know.
8000718	8001198	We'll see.
8001318	8001759	We'll see.
8002579	8002899	Who knows?
8002979	8007480	Maybe I'll get fed up and one of those will become a prize for one of our loyal
8008417	8009138	Ooh, that would be cool.
8009438	8010339	Alright, sounds good.
8010379	8010659	Right.
8012881	8013722	Stop teasing him.
8014722	8020247	Alright, well we're going to go ahead and we'll hear more about Classic Gaming Expo on this week's podcast.
8020267	8020947	You cannot hang up on me!
8021588	8028233	I'm not going to hang up on you, but we have to get to the FUs of the week and the other stuff too in a break, because I really got to go to the bathroom.
8029234	8031276	That was crap.
8032597	8032917	Hello?
8034018	8034779	Are you even listening to me?
8034819	8035139	Hello?
8036881	8037281	Is she there?
8038783	8039323	Whoa, hi.
8039744	8042046	Whoa, she went into evil warlord voice there again for a minute.
8043847	8045669	Anything else you want to say to the listeners before we go?
8049132	8049512	Words.
8050053	8050353	All right.
8051113	8051534	Lobster.
8052995	8054496	All right, have a good one, DarkSakura.
8054536	8055978	We'll see you back for the podcast.
8056838	8057759	Reject false icons.
8057879	8058219	Later.
8059260	8061182	Bye.
8061202	8062743	See, she beat me to the hang up button.
8062963	8063364	I like that.
8064004	8065165	Yeah, that was weird.
8065185	8065946	Like when she was.
8067583	8070585	I am the evil Lord Satan Like, that was really scary.
8071206	8071886	I got freaked out.
8071946	8072267	Alright.
8073768	8077891	Anyway, we're gonna go to a break because I have to pee.
8078111	8083074	And then when we come back from this break, we'll announce tonight's Cage Match winner and we'll get into the FUs of the week as well.
8083515	8086737	So, we're gonna do just Bimani Potpourri this break.
8086817	8093242	Even some wanna-be Bimani music in this break because I'm gonna get to that request that I screwed up last week in this break.
8093642	8095904	So, we'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio after this.
8108908	8111989	DarkSakura, DarkSakura DarkSakura DarkSakura
8227131	8228400	Thank you for watching
8288575	8289693	Thanks for watching!
8341505	8347267	I am a robot, sinking like a robot, walking on the spaceship every night and day.
8347367	8353309	I am a robot, sexy like a robot, making children kept and keeps the streets away.
8353349	8354090	I'm Romeo, I'm Juliet.
8354170	8355210	I'm Romeo, I'm Juliet.
8377752	8380864	I know it's good, but I'm feeling so insatiable
8411515	8421786	I was built to serve a mission And I deeply forget him The first time that I walked in my life I felt a strange attraction Felt a strange attraction
8442475	8445759	I know it's quick and easy Satisfaction Satisfaction Look down
8558152	8561354	After this song, we'll be having a Let Them Move Marathon.
8561674	8562114	No!
8563915	8564576	Just kidding.
8565016	8566037	Orange Lounge Radio.
8566117	8567737	Crap-free Bobani Radio.
8569699	8571940	We're back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
8572920	8577823	And in that break, you heard Naoki was still in my heart, Nina from In The Groove, Romeo and Juliet.
8578724	8579444	Juliet what?
8580545	8584487	Murmur Twins, a guitar mix from Pop Music and Love Is Dreaminess, 2DX, Sick Style.
8585336	8586657	Welcome back to Orange Laundry.
8586717	8587418	Oh, this is weird.
8587498	8589619	Now suddenly Loki and I are sitting in the room by ourselves.
8589679	8592281	Like, all of our guests abandon us, like, all at once.
8592661	8592882	I know.
8593042	8600467	I think Miklatov and Extifer went to Taco Bell, and... Because I don't eat Taco Bell, so I won't take Miklatov there.
8601388	8608613	And then, what, we have... John and Justin went in the front room to go watch television, because I guess that's more interesting than the show.
8609153	8609794	No, there's a certain...
8610356	8619500	There's a certain show that Jon has to watch every week, and I'm sure a lot of you out there are no different, although folks should consider investing in a VCR or TiVo or something.
8621741	8624783	I was reading here about Dancing Stage Max.
8625003	8626144	What's up with Dancing Stage Max?
8626184	8628865	I know there was a little news on Dancing Stage Max this week, so what's up with that?
8628905	8633887	There's a bit more now, because they've made it some games convention or whatever.
8634708	8635948	It was in Europe.
8636488	8637409	They've got some more stuff.
8637449	8638429	They have songs...
8640313	8647317	V, Hip2Hip, The Jam, Sugar Babes, Sophie Ellis, Bexter, Mixed Up World, Labelle, Lady Marmalade, Patty Labelle,
8661986	8663507	No, she never sang that song though, did she?
8663527	8664187	Says LaBelle.
8664627	8665888	I'm just telling you what it says.
8665908	8666148	Okay.
8666748	8667929	Who sang that song originally?
8668089	8669830	Adam Ant with Goody Two Shoes.
8669970	8671351	Oh, that's kind of interesting.
8671791	8673212	Franz Ferdinand with Michael.
8673712	8674052	Okay.
8674592	8676553	Natasha Bedingfield with These Words.
8676713	8677234	I love this song.
8677254	8678114	Hold on, I have a clip of this song.
8678214	8678914	I love this song.
8683957	8685618	And it will have the video from what I understand.
8694678	8707608	Alcazar with This Is The World We Live In Fatboy Slim with Wonderful Nights Naoto Suzuki featuring Martha the Polo Vision Dances and Chorus Yuzo Koshiro with Steps
8712560	8714321	You might remember them from, you know.
8714821	8715781	Oh, yeah.
8715861	8716761	Tragedy.
8716902	8717382	Yeah.
8717502	8718002	Tragedy.
8718422	8722984	No, I was thinking of steps with, um, was it, uh... Five, six, seven, eight.
8723104	8732827	I just know their song Tragedy because my, my... Now, I've, you know, I'm a gay guy myself, so I don't make fun of other gay guys very often, but I used to live with a flaming homosexual, okay?
8733499	8735159	Flaming Homosexual, love him to death.
8735280	8739701	He was a flaming homosexual and he used to listen to that song and do the little dance and everything.
8739961	8755465	Chain Reaction, Christina Milan with Dip It Low, Vic Reeves with Dizzy, Mile with Drop The Pressure, Daniel Bedingfield with Friday, and Carl Douglas with Kung Fu Fighting.
8756645	8758066	And then they've got some more here.
8759269	8775194	Looks like in the demo or the preliminary song list, they mentioned these words, Natasha Bedingfield, Michael, Franz Ferdinand, in the middle, Sugar Babes, Goody Two Shoes, Adam and the Ants, You Sexy Thing, Hot Chocolate, and Shout, Lulu.
8775594	8783677	Now, my question about You Sexy Thing, is it that song they always hear in the commercial, You Sexy, Sexy Thing, You Sexy, because that would be horrible.
8784356	8795862	I don't know, but there's going to be a Dance Master mode in it, as well as some advanced mode thing, and combo challenge mode, which is going to be interesting.
8795882	8799224	I think it's basically the same stuff as in DDR Extreme 2, pretty much.
8800525	8802466	So, that's what we've got there.
8803766	8804127	Sounds good.
8804947	8806428	Thank you for that update on what's going on over there.
8806468	8808729	Oh, and of course, Dancing Stage Mario Mix is coming soon.
8809937	8812660	DDR with Mario is a game we haven't really talked about a whole lot lately.
8812700	8823108	I know it came out in Japan to this big... The DDR fans, anyway, in America, really... People usually import their DDRs from Japan, but I haven't really heard of anybody importing Mario.
8823489	8825070	So nobody's really been going crazy over it.
8825671	8827272	How do you think that game's going to do over here?
8827352	8830735	I haven't really heard a lot of buzz about this game.
8832629	8842579	GameCube is sinking ship right now, especially after... Please, Nintendo fanboys, don't start flaming me because I love Nintendo dearly.
8843100	8844361	I love Nintendo.
8844842	8846483	But they fucked up that Zelda thing.
8846683	8850167	Come on, pushing back Zelda to 2006, come on.
8850227	8851048	They fucked that up.
8851681	8880247	so a lot of people are just like done with Nintendo for right now in fact if you're running if you look at the poll right now going on at OrangeLaunchRadio.com I don't think the Nintendo screwed up result is winning but a significant amount of people have been answering that that way so it's kind of I don't know interesting yeah I don't know really you know speaking on the rental side of things nobody carries the GameCube anymore nobody
8882244	8883385	and the stuff they release for it.
8883605	8893356	It's really kid-based games like Mario Superstar Baseball or Mario Strikers, which is coming out because everybody loves soccer or football, however you want to call it.
8893917	8896680	But just, I don't know.
8899214	8926561	of course I've got the mandatory fuck you Sky you hate Nintendo and I hate you comment from the chatroom I don't hate Nintendo I have not stopped playing Meteos for like the past two months I'm squeeing like a little girl over Nintendogs which is coming out Tuesday I don't even freaking like dogs that much I've never owned a dog in my life the only dog I ever liked was my grandma's Dachshund but I am buying Nintendogs because I'll be damned if that wasn't the cutest game I've seen in like five years
8926940	8928201	So don't tell me I hate Nintendo.
8928221	8928901	I love Nintendo.
8929181	8930622	They really fucked up Zelda.
8930662	8932203	They really, really fucked that up.
8933683	8934084	Really?
8934464	8938246	And this whole thing with the revolution, we still haven't heard shit about it.
8938686	8942448	And they're even talking about me releasing it the fall of 2006.
8942548	8946370	Wow, that's not gonna fucking suck.
8947570	8950512	Unless it's like super revolutionary, which I highly doubt that.
8951192	8951692	But we'll see.
8951712	8953333	All right.
8955429	8958392	Who wants to see the winner of tonight's cage match?
8958452	8961015	You want to know tonight's wiener for tonight's cage match?
8961095	8962756	Sure, since I'm the only other person in here.
8963177	8966240	There were a freaking ton of votes in tonight's cage match.
8966300	8966920	Ton of votes.
8967561	8971845	Not a single vote for DJ Sammy, which pisses me the fuck off.
8972245	8976429	So next week, you are getting another booty song.
8976469	8978872	You're getting something along the lines of Camel Toe.
8980293	8981673	or what was another booty song I put in?
8981713	8982414	Milkshake.
8982774	8984695	Milkshake, Put It In My Mouth.
8985095	8986616	All those songs I put in case before.
8986656	8991438	You're getting another one of those next week because I'm pissed off that not a single person voted for DJ Sammy.
8992098	8992519	Suck it.
8994199	8995900	So anyway, it came down to the other two songs.
8995940	8997541	It was actually very, very close.
8997621	9004985	A lot of votes, but a couple votes did sway it towards a two-week win for
9006380	9007881	Cold Storage with Onyx.
9008521	9011102	I should put my backup songs in more often.
9011182	9013963	Two weeks winning there, Cold Storage with Onyx.
9014843	9016864	Congratulations, Loki, you bastard.
9017304	9018484	I don't have to pick a song next week.
9018524	9020185	That's a reward enough for me.
9020405	9022826	So next week you get a booty song from me, because I'm pissed.
9023286	9028108	And I'm sure DarkSakura's not happy either, so she'll dig into her archives of
9029088	9031870	Nerd Music and find something.
9032570	9034111	How else do you explain MC Chris?
9034131	9035312	That's his Nerd Music.
9035552	9037374	Nobody else gets MC Chris but nerds.
9037994	9043138	So I'm calling her Music Nerd Music, but with love and respect, of course.
9044599	9044939	All right.
9045379	9048701	Anyway, we're going to get into the FUs of the week.
9048781	9054505	It's that time of the show where we get a little bit angsty and we do the FUs of the week.
9055106	9055366	So...
9056485	9056786	Grr, Arrg
9076758	9092987	Alright, as a reminder, boys and girls, if you have an FU of the week you want to send in, you can submit us an FU by joining our chat room, www.orangeloungeradio.com and clicking on chat, and you can send me a private message, and we will read your FUs, but...
9093667	9098971	May I take this opportunity, since Jamie isn't here to fill this space right now, to give you guys some reminders.
9099291	9102353	We do not give FUs of a personal nature.
9103835	9106576	Unless it's like mom, dad, because we've all been angsty teens.
9106637	9107257	We do those.
9107277	9114622	And if it's somebody we don't know, but if you're flaming somebody in the community specifically, we usually don't like that unless it's like Jack Thompson or something.
9114642	9115143	Or me.
9115343	9116043	We all hate him.
9116123	9116564	Or Loki.
9116584	9117464	We let you flame Loki.
9117805	9120527	But we don't like to flame people that aren't here to defend themselves.
9120567	9121727	So those are always off limits.
9123980	9128702	And, uh, no racist FUs, unless they're really funny.
9130363	9133124	Because that's the only time we'll let them in, is if they're really funny.
9134665	9139447	Alright, uh, let's see, actually I have a private message from DarkSakura, so maybe she does have some FUs.
9139467	9141928	Here we go, she would like to say, Fuck my hip hurting!
9143028	9147030	And fuck the speed limit, which I broke by at least 20 miles.
9148171	9150752	And fuck not buying a Duo RX.
9151823	9153664	So those are DarkSakura's FUs of the week.
9153705	9154785	I think she's still typing.
9155206	9156387	Oh, no, she's... Oh, here's another one.
9156967	9159169	And lastly... I'm waiting for this.
9159609	9160770	DarkSakura's last FU.
9160970	9163272	FU to the internet being slow, and FU to the big buffer.
9164013	9167275	The 30 seconds between when we talk and when you guys actually hear it.
9170318	9170738	We're waiting.
9171038	9173660	Oh, she's typing a big long sentence here, because it's taking a while to get it.
9174441	9176763	We'll just enjoy the Silent Hill 2 music here for a little bit.
9176783	9176763	1, 2, 2...
9180785	9181186	Oh, here it is.
9181567	9184952	Fuck being jacked up on Vicodin and unable to drive.
9186334	9187195	And DarkSakura?
9187515	9191822	Yes, the Coleco emulator was on the DS.
9192663	9194987	Now it's time for Loki's FUs.
9195879	9196800	Just sobs.
9219042	9234610	So I'm sitting there going, because the fucking, then he flips me off, so then he finally turns, you know, pulls over, and then I flip him off and honk my horn and make, you know, comments like, You know, stuff like that.
9234710	9236711	Our listeners, speakers, thank you for that.
9237871	9244655	Well, they had to, you have to understand that I was yelling very loud, so, you know, I was trying to convey that, because I said,
9245559	9247760	I yelled, you know, you fucking piece of shit.
9247820	9249821	It isn't quite, you know, the same effect.
9250862	9251162	Anyways.
9253103	9258205	And then fuck you to the fact that I've still got to drive my fiance around everywhere because that kind of sucks.
9259446	9264748	And I still need a picture of me doing this show for a stupid magazine thing.
9264908	9265769	I found all my batteries.
9265889	9266449	I can take a picture.
9266569	9267069	Okay, cool.
9267389	9268050	Yes, all right.
9268090	9268570	That's all I have.
9268610	9269670	We'll pose pictures later.
9269710	9273732	And just fuck you to Jack Thompson because it's fun to say that.
9274853	9275193	All right.
9278020	9278352	My turn.
9284713	9312328	I would like to give a big F you to getting sick and an F you to Southwest Airlines for their little hotbeds of viruses they call airplanes and the fact that I caught a sinus infection an F you to the fact that I didn't go to the doctor for a few days an F you to my allergy to amoxicillin because apparently amoxicillin is the best thing to take for this stuff but if I take amoxicillin I break out in a big rash and I look like Freaky Rash Boy so I can't stop laughing
9313593	9314573	Why are you laughing at that?
9314593	9317274	Will you show up at the next DDR tournament as Freaky Rashboy?
9317374	9321656	No, because they say if I do that too much, I might die, so I can't take penicillin, like, ever.
9321756	9323196	Okay, a really good tournament, then.
9324636	9333899	Anyway, so, an FU to the fact, an FU to the nasal spray I have being a brand copay, because brands are more expensive than generics.
9335080	9339721	And that's it, that's all my FUs of the week, I'm really not that angsty, because I've been sick all week, I haven't had time to get angry.
9340221	9341422	So we're gonna go to Justin!
9342422	9342622	Hello.
9343526	9345568	Uh, hmm, what can I say?
9345928	9348910	Oh yeah, my FUs are kind of tied into Jamie's, oddly.
9349550	9356114	FU to my hip hurting, because I have a hip problem, and it really has been hurting for like a month now, and I don't know what to do.
9358095	9361838	And also tied into Jamie, FU to female drivers.
9362697	9366758	Because they keep trying to hit me when I'm on the freeway, and that's kind of annoying.
9367298	9373080	Now, uh, I can understand if you need to get somewhere fast, but don't go in the slow lane.
9373120	9375421	Keep in the fast lane and stay there, please.
9375481	9379462	Had one driving today, doing her hair and makeup while driving.
9379562	9380202	Oh my god.
9380222	9381623	Fucking suck.
9381883	9392206	My friend keeps on, uh, as soon as she's trying to go to school in the morning, she always takes like a left turn, and every single day the same woman cuts her off so she can do her makeup.
9392970	9393671	It's ridiculous.
9394993	9396134	And that's about it.
9398177	9401922	Oh wow, Mikulatov gets back just in time from Taco Bell to give his FUs of the week.
9402543	9403925	Okay, I want music.
9405267	9405928	This is your music.
9406048	9406489	What is it?
9406729	9408151	It's Help Me Dr. Dick by Erotic.
9408809	9411970	I used to have an actual music that you would play.
9412110	9412690	Really?
9412730	9414510	What do you want?
9414650	9418571	Oh, put the new one from Happy Sky, the one that's in French.
9419031	9420912	Jesus Christ, what's the name of it?
9420972	9422232	Or you'll get an FU.
9422612	9426113	It's like... I don't know how to say it.
9427113	9430334	How about you just do your FUs and stop whining like a little bitch?
9430634	9432194	Because that's my FU.
9432834	9434194	Okay, anyway, I don't really care.
9435355	9436475	Oh, this is Twin Amadeus.
9437112	9437452	Sorry.
9438013	9438673	You get this.
9439033	9440114	Deal with it.
9441415	9442956	You get the Christmas sounding song.
9442996	9445858	Wouldn't it be funny if I don't have any FUs?
9446098	9449440	FU to Medios for being way too addictive.
9451261	9460027	FU to Pump It Up for PS2 because unlocking songs is way too hard to do on that game.
9462188	9464850	FU to Work
9466308	9466528	Tag.
9466708	9466869	Tag.
9488999	9490179	but probably Christine.
9490499	9493440	An FU to Miklatov for not offering to pick me up a pizza.
9493460	9495721	Because that's the only thing I like at Taco Bell is Pizza Hut.
9497301	9498462	You should have said something.
9498482	9499402	I'm just kidding, it's alright.
9500942	9501362	Alright.
9502823	9507264	Let's go to the next FUs, which would be the ones from our chatroom.
9508504	9508965	Yay.
9510185	9513186	Dark Knight would like to say an FU to gas prices.
9513746	9515086	Quote the Dark Knight nevermore.
9515246	9517587	Oh, but FU to work and being broke as hell.
9519369	9522350	Misty would like to say a private message to me.
9522410	9523491	That wasn't an FU.
9523551	9524171	Sorry, guys.
9525351	9526012	Oh, wait, no, there it is.
9526052	9526392	I'm sorry.
9526732	9529773	I didn't recognize it because it didn't start with FU2.
9529853	9535275	It says, You people should be lucky that I'm not so angsty because I went to Six Flags today.
9535955	9539117	FU to the max, too, at Six Flags, having dusty-ass pads.
9539857	9544859	Thank leetness I managed to own a minute with 29 greats and one miss, in sandals even.
9546547	9548849	Brini says, an F you to learning to drive.
9549209	9549730	Enough said.
9549790	9554934	An F you to all the IRC chat users who want us to stop advertising that one channel.
9555134	9558957	Which channel?
9560218	9563181	If I say it, then I'm dignifying it with acknowledging it.
9563581	9564282	Which channel?
9564322	9570107	Take every inside joke from the past five episodes of Order's Lounge Radio and combine it into one name, and that's the name of the channel.
9570707	9570967	Wow.
9571148	9573950	So, Oregon Trail, Bleached...
9574765	9575666	Asshole, what else?
9576186	9576546	All of it.
9578748	9582591	Chimera, and by the way, the whole chatroom is saying F you to this song, but you can just deal.
9583151	9586153	Chimera says F you to school starting in about three days.
9586313	9588835	Oh, and Jack Thompson, because MPQ said so.
9589215	9590216	And Spider Stomp.
9591537	9595600	Socorina says F you to myself for whoring old jokes in the chatroom.
9596040	9598682	And F you to Jack Thompson, because MPQ said so.
9599102	9602365	And F you to someone for making Socorina is pissed.
9602445	9604166	Oops, I advertised that channel, sorry.
9606317	9608898	Yay, somebody in the chatroom said, I heart this song.
9608998	9610098	I heart it too, thank you.
9610698	9615999	Alright, Lesson Izaku says, F you to this being my last week at home before having to move back to campus next Sunday.
9616559	9618960	F you to being broke and being jobless for almost nine months.
9619460	9627621	F you to not having enough time to hang out with other fellow DDR players every time I go to Chinatown Fair, a DDR and In The Groove 2 arcade in Chinatown, New York City.
9628482	9632382	And F you to having to wear a retainer after my braces were removed last week.
9632722	9635463	They hurt like hell and I can't speak in them clearly.
9636149	9636469	in them.
9643493	9647896	Kuwabara says, F you to Noria for making such a sexy video to Sylvia Drive.
9647936	9649237	I can't pass the fucking song.
9651518	9656822	Goggle says, not Google, but Goggle says, I would like to say F you to US News College Rankings.
9657202	9664026	They really don't mean anything, but all the overachieving, pushy parents flock to the top ones and crowd up the tours so I can't hear anything.
9665256	9667878	Tomokun would like to say, fuck starting school soon.
9668218	9671640	Fuck people I don't know taking pictures of me playing para para dancing.
9671981	9674142	And fuck a certain thread in the Midwest forum.
9674262	9674903	Fuck, fuck!
9676964	9679066	Dark Knight wants to give one more FU.
9679666	9686971	Oh, and a major FU to some local buttwads that go nuts when they have a laptop sale on an old-ass school uses iBooks.
9687051	9689353	Because of this, many people got hurt by the idiots.
9690618	9693020	I heard about the iBook stampede.
9693260	9694240	It was crazy.
9694461	9695901	I heard about it too.
9696322	9696882	And I giggled.
9697723	9698203	You would.
9698843	9703827	By the way, I haven't heard anyone use the term buttwads in like years.
9704687	9705268	That's great.
9706288	9706668	Thank you.
9708430	9711251	Ask Orange Lounge when we come back from this quick break.
9711311	9712432	Featuring more erotic.
9712572	9714654	No, just kidding, because I'll get beat up if we actually do that.
9715114	9716095	I already played erotic.
9716415	9718116	Erotic fans, I already played it this show.
9718656	9719757	How about some guitar freaks?
9720580	9721361	I like Guitar Freaks.
9721421	9722181	Guitar Freaks is cool.
9722862	9727245	So we're going to do some of that, and when we come back, we will do some Ask Orange Lounge.
9727265	9728626	We're just going to do a couple songs here.
9728666	9732909	We'll start off with a little bit of Jet Coaster Girl, and we'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio.
9732989	9734631	Ask Orange Lounge, sending your questions right now.
9738153	9738774	Ask Orange Lounge
9749637	9752298	There's only a little bit left, but it's different today.
9752398	9754199	Of course, yesterday was a B-Holiday Sunday.
9754219	9756259	The beat of the beat can't be cut off.
9756339	9758400	I want to make my heart beat faster.
9758520	9759600	If this feeling is true,
9780636	9781818	Thanks for watching!
9820846	9821808	Thanks for watching!
9866098	9868059	Music, Music, Music
9905867	9914521	Don't you know, baby, you could show up right on time Can't you see, can't you see, I've been waiting for you Can't you see, baby, you could fly on
9932125	9938867	All right, you know what time it is, kids.
9939307	9940408	Time for the next segment.
9940668	9941428	Let's bring it on.
9948370	9951311	Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.
9951791	9954992	What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?
9955533	9956933	One thing I will tell you is...
9957378	9962462	Even though nobody asked, is that now Miklatov made this room smell like Taco Bell?
9965745	9967966	Thanks a lot for that, because, you know, Taco Bell makes me sick.
9968927	9969428	You're welcome.
9969728	9971830	Alright.
9971970	9976393	Participating in tonight's Ask Orange Lounge, myself, Loki, and Miklatov.
9976433	9978535	Everybody else left the room for better things, I guess.
9979526	9979907	HighSchoolFreshman
9995506	9997986	Just make sure you don't fuck up and go to the wrong classes.
9998727	10000607	I was always worried about going to the wrong classes.
10000667	10002387	Get your schedule ahead of time.
10004448	10009268	In my situation where I had it was, my junior high split up into two different high schools.
10009328	10011469	Some of my friends weren't there and some of them were new.
10012469	10013349	Find your friends.
10014049	10018410	It's not going to be that much different than junior high, really.
10020550	10022211	Who gives a shit about the upperclassmen?
10022371	10024831	If they're still picking on you, that's retarded.
10025140	10031225	Yeah, the upperclassmen hazing thing is so, like, 1970, because every school now has the anti-hazing rules.
10031265	10037811	So it's nothing, even when I went to high school, which was quite some time ago, they didn't have a problem with that.
10037911	10039753	So, you know what?
10039773	10041214	Just be yourself.
10041714	10041975	Just don't...
10043118	10044459	Don't try to be something you're not.
10044699	10046999	I wish I could tell every high schooler in the world that.
10047079	10049480	Just be yourself and who cares what other people think.
10049580	10049940	Exactly.
10049960	10050541	Who cares?
10050701	10058843	And really, when you think about it now, when you get out of high school and stuff, you look back on it and you're just like, who cares?
10058963	10061764	You know, like, if people didn't like you for some reason, you don't care.
10062124	10065766	All you look back on is the things that you didn't do that you wish you had.
10065826	10066666	That's basically it.
10067406	10070127	Okay, to completely counter, you know,
10070899	10072000	Subtitles by the Amara.org community
10089315	10089836	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10103183	10103503	I don't know.
10103883	10106204	The only people you can make fun of are the stupid people.
10106424	10109385	Not the retarded people, because they can't help it, but stupid people.
10109485	10110986	Every click serves its purpose.
10111306	10112306	We've got to move on.
10112326	10113427	We've got a ton of questions tonight.
10113507	10116087	I begged twice and I got tons of questions the second time.
10116788	10124570	Rini wants to know, my question is someone to please describe quest mode in Ultramix 3 if they've played it at E3.
10126678	10129540	Shane probably can't really say anything about quest mode.
10130620	10131821	Super deformed characters.
10132061	10134062	Yeah, the characters are like the giant heads.
10134502	10138765	Basically, you move across the capitals of the United States, starting in Sacramento.
10138805	10139245	Thank you very much.
10140566	10147609	I think it costs points to move around the map, and you earn points by playing the song in the city.
10148490	10150991	Was it like a challenge that you had to do or something?
10151451	10151912	Hey, guess what?
10151932	10153693	Quest mode kind of changed since E3.
10154073	10154373	Did it?
10154433	10154913	Yeah.
10155133	10156194	Can you tell us anything new about it?
10156738	10161260	No, you can continue though, because it follows the same basic principle you're talking about.
10161300	10161740	Bastard.
10162220	10168883	So you earn, I guess, points by playing the song in the city and then you can move around the map, and I suppose that... You pick up more players as you go.
10168923	10170043	I think so, yeah, you pick up more players.
10170324	10174525	I'm assuming that this is going to be how a shitload of things unlock in Ultimix 3, or however many.
10175146	10178727	I think the goal is to ultimately conquer all 50 states.
10179747	10182309	Or maybe it's just 48 continental, I don't know.
10182869	10184129	That's where you're wrong!
10184529	10184910	Oh, really?
10184970	10185710	It's around the world.
10186479	10187660	That's where you're wrong!
10188020	10188460	Canada?
10188480	10190681	Oh god, do you have to go to Mexico?
10191401	10192122	I hope not.
10192622	10194543	I don't play DDR in Mexico, it's pumping up there.
10194863	10195783	Yeah, it actually is.
10196104	10196444	Alright.
10199965	10202066	Alright, um, let's see.
10202306	10205508	So you can't tell us anything about what might have changed, not anything?
10206448	10207009	I really can't.
10207629	10214092	It's just, it's not that big a difference, but there are some subtle changes to it that... Alright, we'll see.
10215006	10217447	Alright, Rini also wants to know... Oh, you will see.
10218528	10223490	Rini wants to know, oh, and when are you guys going to do some online Ultramix 2 tournament?
10224010	10224751	Um, that's a good idea.
10224811	10225851	Sometime before Ultramix 3.
10225971	10228733	Um, in the next couple months when we stop being lazy.
10228753	10234015	We're trying to plan a real DDR tournament, um, and I'm trying to go to the tournament back east as well.
10234596	10236196	Um, it shouldn't be that hard.
10236837	10243420	We'll maybe start a forum, or a thread in the forums and see if there's enough interest in it, because last time we tried to do it, like, nobody wanted to play.
10244254	10247837	We will see.
10247957	10250559	We'll post a thread in the forums and see what we get out of that.
10251159	10254362	Socorino wants to know, what is the official release date for Xtreme 2?
10256563	10257544	I'll field that one.
10259045	10262848	It's September, I want to say, 27th.
10263228	10265750	That might be the 26th.
10265970	10269093	I know it's the last week of September.
10269113	10269193	Okay.
10269881	10275826	Sakurina also wants to know, does Konami of America plan on releasing Dancing Stage featuring System of a Down anytime soon?
10276206	10277487	I will go ahead and answer that question.
10277707	10277927	No.
10278888	10280289	Can I answer it too?
10281550	10282091	No.
10282871	10285554	Sakurina, oh, that's the official word from a Konami person, by the way.
10285954	10288616	Sakurina also wants to know, where do babies come from?
10289377	10290718	Vaginas, actually.
10296929	10297709	Dark Knight.
10298749	10299270	Oh, never mind.
10299370	10301450	That was a personal thing he's sharing with me.
10302231	10305232	Xander C wants to know, I can't read it anyway if it's personal.
10305632	10309973	Xander C wants to know, why did Konami kill off Parapara anyways?
10310554	10316636	It's like they knew I'd like the game later and killed it off just to get me even more pissed than when they started attacking in the groove.
10316736	10319737	It's the same reason why Billy Ray Cyrus doesn't make any more music.
10320157	10322218	It's because it's not popular anymore.
10323398	10326180	Even though there's a lot of sarcasm there, there is some truth.
10326280	10329842	From what I understand, Parapara kind of went downhill in Japan for a little while.
10329883	10330623	Yeah, it was a fad.
10330743	10331343	That's all it was.
10331363	10334005	But it seems like it's still going on.
10334065	10337007	I mean, you still see Eurobeats big with initial D and stuff.
10337087	10338788	I have a hard time believing it's dead altogether.
10342231	10342891	I guess here it is.
10343311	10344872	Why did Keyboard Mania stop?
10344932	10346432	Why did Dance Maniacs stop?
10346492	10352614	Why did any of those great Bomani series that we don't come to love until long after they stopped, stop?
10352754	10353954	Because they didn't make enough money.
10354194	10355394	They didn't sell enough machines.
10355914	10356274	The end.
10357135	10357815	That's the reason.
10358755	10360635	Infer what you want about the culture and the pop thing.
10360896	10362536	If it didn't make money, that's why it didn't continue.
10362976	10366777	But then again, DDR was making money, but whatever.
10368860	10369300	Whatever.
10370440	10372141	We could argue about that till we're blue in the face.
10374561	10379102	Legend of Zaku says, Hmm, I wonder what surprises wait for us on the song list for Ultramix 3.
10379622	10381423	Well, if we told you, Zaku, they wouldn't be a surprise.
10382263	10386704	Also, is it just me or is My My My from EX2 a damn good song to freestyle to?
10387464	10389284	I'm white, therefore I can't freestyle.
10389404	10390565	It's just a good song.
10390805	10392425	It's one of my favorites, that's for sure.
10393405	10394685	The background cracks me up, too.
10395386	10397146	Initial D... Okay, Jamie's...
10397828	10398549	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
10417828	10419949	Legend of Zaku said, this one's for Miklatov.
10420009	10423450	Will Quest Mode make stops at New York City or the East Coast?
10424551	10427192	He can't really answer questions about Quest Mode because he's under NDA.
10427592	10428332	I will answer, though.
10428372	10431993	From what I saw at E3, it looks like you were stopping in the capital of every state.
10432434	10434835	So you wouldn't stop in New York City, but Albany.
10435615	10435835	So...
10436771	10437232	DarkSakura says...
10464122	10467615	Why the fuck does southern style iced tea taste so heavenly?
10468823	10469143	I don't know.
10469183	10469544	You know what?
10469564	10478090	I was going to have iced tea at Cracker Barrel, which is as close to Southern Stylist as I'll get, but I didn't get the chance to do that while I was visiting the East Coast.
10478390	10479651	I have a question for her.
10480452	10482554	Why aren't you here supporting Pump It Up?
10483254	10487317	She can't because of her... She was at Classic Gaming Expo and she hurt her hip.
10487377	10489739	And she was partially turned into an evil warlord.
10489979	10490860	That was really cool.
10491460	10492661	She was already an evil warlord.
10492741	10494663	That is going in the next intro.
10494683	10495303	That's for sure.
10496765	10498486	Smackman would like to know
10499560	10503242	Why do only the crappy songs get stuck in your head?
10505183	10506664	Because you listen to bad music.
10507424	10508545	That's a very good question.
10509105	10511786	It's just Murphy's Law that bad songs are going to get stuck in your head.
10512226	10514688	And I don't know, you know, it's just a fact of life.
10514828	10516329	So I leave you with this.
10517009	10518330	This is a good song.
10518350	10521871	Enjoy, courtesy of Orange Lounge Radio.
10532710	10539054	Uh, Spiritsnare, question, do you get to kill Naoki as an extra stage in quest mode?
10539434	10547098	Um, I will answer that question, no you do not, and I don't work for Konami and I haven't seen the game outside of E3, but I just know the answer is no, I'm sorry to say.
10548018	10550820	Um, but it changed since E3.
10551400	10553401	Dun dun dun!
10555222	10559945	Let's see, uh, Addendum, do you get to kill Jack Thompson as a one more extra stage in quest mode?
10561193	10562334	I will also answer that question.
10562394	10562874	No, you do not.
10563194	10563695	I'm sorry to say.
10564055	10565716	And Konami, could you confirm that?
10566697	10567337	Our Konami rep?
10567677	10568438	Konami.
10568518	10569639	I'm all of Konami.
10569679	10570259	Yeah, basically.
10570779	10572620	When it comes to this question, yes, you are.
10574702	10583587	I hate him as much as you guys do, but he provides entertainment for the morning every day for me because he always does something new and stupid, so I don't want him dead.
10584088	10585849	I don't want him to shut up.
10586690	10588111	So please quit trying to kill him.
10588731	10592172	Besides, there's plenty more games for him to be angry over, you know, come fall.
10592452	10596034	Yeah, so, I mean, we've just hit the tip of the iceberg.
10596734	10598255	It's gonna get a lot better, I'm sure.
10599135	10602556	I don't know, when Titanic hit the tip of the iceberg, it didn't get much better.
10606378	10608539	It's almost like the living room had heard that joke.
10611200	10613201	God, sometimes I wish we were a TV show, seriously.
10616002	10616282	Anyway,
10617493	10618634	We've got to start wrapping up the show.
10618674	10623239	However, there's one more question, so I'm going to be nice and take this question because we started a little late anyway.
10623980	10630226	Rene wants to know, Why doesn't Konami bring back hold notes and scratches in Beatmania 2DX?
10630827	10635532	Rene would like to point out, scratches were in Beatmania the final and hold notes in Beatmania 3, I believe.
10635885	10637006	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10664363	10667312	As far as Konami in Japan, I couldn't tell you, but look at this.
10667870	10676652	Beatmania 5 key songs are making its way into the US, and you can already see that Konami US is doing its own thing with Beatmania.
10676692	10680233	Like, they have the balls to change the interface, for one, to a new color.
10680513	10683214	Granted, it's just a new color, but it's something.
10683854	10685615	It's also Happy Sky Difficulty Names.
10686115	10690096	Yes, and rumor is that the controllers are going to be different.
10690116	10691136	No, it's not a rumor.
10691376	10697078	Enos confirmed it in an interview on, I think, GameSpot.
10697608	10700370	They have the rounded edges and they address the buttons.
10700550	10701130	Oh, super.
10701350	10704572	I thought that was something that... Yeah, anyway.
10704872	10713477	And also, I'm hoping that they bring actual hold keys, for example, like in Keyboard Mania or in Easy to DJ.
10714157	10716298	That would be awesome if they implemented that later on.
10716618	10719020	So I would say probably not this mix.
10719540	10724605	But, you know, they're going to want to have things later on that kind of make their mixes like, ooh, it's the new thing in this mix.
10725265	10726586	Don't count it out for the U.S.
10726647	10726947	mixes.
10727087	10729289	I seriously, I would say don't count it out for the U.S.
10729469	10729990	later mixes.
10730270	10736115	So long as you guys support it and buy it, because, I mean, if it tanks, well, it's on you.
10736195	10742761	I'm at least buying a controller to replace my old one, because I'm excited about the idea of the new controller, so we'll see.
10743516	10744177	And then Blame TV.
10744217	10744377	Yep.
10768562	10771585	Alright, that's going to do it for tonight's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
10771605	10774187	Thank you guys so much for tuning in and listening to and supporting us.
10774227	10774828	We appreciate it.
10774868	10777450	Don't forget, we also have a live show on Tuesday night.
10777490	10779932	That's Pump Up the Volume with the one and only DarkSakura.
10780433	10782715	And I will be bringing a show back very soon.
10782735	10786859	I know I've said that for like the past seven weeks, but I got very sick this week, so that's why I didn't do it.
10787399	10788200	But maybe this next week.
10788760	10791523	And, you know, more exciting stuff coming to Orange Lounge Radio.
10792903	10793824	Also the podcast.
10794904	10798185	We have an unbelievable amount of listeners on the podcast.
10798225	10799945	Thank you guys so much for your support of the podcast.
10799985	10800566	It's crazy.
10800906	10803887	We're also working on something for those PSP owners out there.
10804067	10804787	Oh, that's going to be great.
10805027	10810068	So we're hoping to have a breakthrough on that, being the first online station to have something like that.
10810188	10810709	So we'll see.
10811189	10813029	Anyway, thank you guys for your support.
10813069	10813690	We appreciate you.
10813730	10813950	Love you.
10815728	10816429	Thank you for watching!
10830976	10833637	I ate too much Taco Bell, now my stomach hurts.
10834197	10836718	And two, does anybody want to go to work for me tomorrow?
10836738	10837338	Because I don't.
10839459	10840260	Loki, your final thought.
10841480	10852524	I've got to bring over next week the iToy, because I have, and the microphone, because I have SingStar Pop, that one we've got to try out.
10852584	10853325	Yeah, I want to see that.
10853485	10856706	And then I also have iToy, Harry Potter iToys,
10857045	10861806	Sega, and iToyPlay, and I think I'm going to try to get Play 2 as well.
10862087	10872630	Even though DarkSakura, I think, called it a bastardization of the original Samba de Amigo, I really want to play the iToySamba, because I didn't get to play it at E3.
10873190	10874750	So I don't want to misquote her.
10874770	10876351	She might not have said that, but I'm pretty sure she didn't.
10876883	10879805	It should be fun.
10879825	10882586	But, um, there's that.
10882846	10886729	And then, um, I've got an actual, um, another import I gotta try.
10886769	10890030	It's another street racing game store, like, initially.
10890251	10899896	They need to put, um, what is it, um, Midnight Toon on their Wangdangs, Midnight Maximum Toon on the console systems, because that'd be awesome.
10900316	10901297	That game's actually pretty cool.
10902417	10902658	Alright.
10903758	10904879	Alrighty, um...
10906080	10916148	and I would just like to say thank you guys very much for listening and I hope I feel better next week and I'm just looking forward to getting in some major gaming this next week with my brand new PlayStation.
10917970	10923614	And on behalf of DarkSakura I'd like to say reject false icons because you know that's her thing and what she'd say if she were here.
10924255	10925276	And that's it.
10925336	10926417	The final word of the show.
10926577	10927698	One word to sum it all up.
10928158	10929439	The one and only Miklatov.
10932401	10932661	What?
10932682	10933222	What?
10934770	10939653	That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.

10971073	10971353	No!

11029811	11030852	They don't know that they're ugly.
11031972	11032833	That's very funny.
11033593	11035334	A fly marrying a bumblebee.
11036594	11037675	I told you I'd shoot.
11038382	11039343	But you didn't believe me.
11040064	11041245	Why didn't you believe me?
