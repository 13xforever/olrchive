00:04.000 --> 00:13.500
You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.

00:13.500 --> 00:18.500
Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Skye, and Loki.

00:18.500 --> 00:28.500
Hello once again, everybody, and welcome to another edition of Orange Lounge Radio To Go, your home for discussion on video games that don't suck.

00:28.500 --> 00:32.500
it's all the news you really want to know about here on Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.500 --> 00:36.420
and big thank you to those you guys who helped us I know you mentioned this

00:36.420 --> 00:39.780
Loki last week but since I wasn't here last week I'm back by the way hello

00:39.780 --> 00:44.020
this is let's introduce ourselves

00:44.020 --> 00:48.260
my name is Rob Roberts you might know me as Skye joining me is DarkSakura

00:48.260 --> 00:52.180
How did you get through all the packing tape and the bubble wrap?

00:52.180 --> 00:56.300
Very slowly that's why I was gone two weeks. Ah it took you that long

00:56.300 --> 00:58.500
I just thought that they just got tired and shipped you back.

00:58.500 --> 01:00.380
And possibly a little bit of that.

01:00.380 --> 01:01.820
And the one and only Loki.

01:01.820 --> 01:02.940
I am here.

01:02.940 --> 01:03.980
Yes, you are.

01:03.980 --> 01:09.820
All right, so we were kind of in an interesting position

01:09.820 --> 01:10.340
last week.

01:10.340 --> 01:12.500
Since I wasn't here, Loki and Dark Sakura

01:12.500 --> 01:14.580
couldn't use the regular studio.

01:14.580 --> 01:16.860
So they effectively had to record last week's show

01:16.860 --> 01:18.780
through two tin cans and a piece of string

01:18.780 --> 01:19.780
or something like that.

01:19.780 --> 01:20.860
No, seriously.

01:20.860 --> 01:22.540
A laptop and a headset.

01:22.540 --> 01:23.620
A laptop and a headset.

01:23.620 --> 01:25.460
And I had to edit in stuff.

01:25.460 --> 01:27.500
So don't complain.

01:27.500 --> 01:29.100
So if you're wondering why last week's show

01:29.100 --> 01:30.400
sounded a little bit different,

01:30.400 --> 01:32.000
it's because it wasn't in the usual studio,

01:32.000 --> 01:32.840
but you know what, kids?

01:32.840 --> 01:33.940
That's how dedicated we are

01:33.940 --> 01:35.640
to giving you new material every week.

01:35.640 --> 01:36.740
Some shows would've just said,

01:36.740 --> 01:39.060
oh, well, screw it, we're gonna take the week off.

01:39.060 --> 01:40.020
Nope, not us.

01:40.980 --> 01:42.380
Not us.

01:42.380 --> 01:44.180
Anyway, I just wanted to personally thank,

01:44.180 --> 01:45.100
I know, Loki, thank you last week.

01:45.100 --> 01:46.140
I wanna personally thank you guys

01:46.140 --> 01:48.120
for helping us out with the podcast awards

01:48.120 --> 01:50.820
and getting us a win over there for Best Gaming Podcast.

01:50.820 --> 01:52.540
That's amazing, that's incredible.

01:52.540 --> 01:54.340
I can't even, wow.

01:54.340 --> 01:57.420
I mean this podcast was originally supposed to be the little side

01:57.420 --> 02:01.180
show that we figured out maybe like a couple people downloaded the ones that

02:01.180 --> 02:03.260
listen to our three hour show and it'll be cute

02:03.260 --> 02:08.420
but now this thing is just like blown up huge it's its own thing now and and even

02:08.420 --> 02:11.740
on iTunes this week I wanna also say a big thank you to iTunes because we're

02:11.740 --> 02:12.420
actually

02:12.420 --> 02:15.780
listed on the iTunes front page under like

02:15.780 --> 02:19.220
interesting indies and I thought that was kinda cool to be called like an indie

02:19.220 --> 02:20.260
podcast so

02:20.260 --> 02:23.500
just to be up there with others well yeah cuz once we start podcasting

02:23.500 --> 02:25.800
everybody's got to start podcasting

02:25.800 --> 02:30.860
I know we're trendsetters but that's okay. I'd like to think we were the first podcast but I

02:30.860 --> 02:33.760
think Adam Curry might have an issue with that claim so

02:33.760 --> 02:36.860
but we we we got on board we got on board pretty soon

02:36.860 --> 02:40.340
anyway let's talk about some games specifically the games we've been

02:40.340 --> 02:40.940
playing

02:40.940 --> 02:44.140
for the last week or so Dark Sakura what's

02:44.140 --> 02:47.660
been going on in your gaming world? I went back to widescreen pong because

02:47.660 --> 02:54.340
I'm starting school next week. So I've been going crazy trying to get stuff together. I'm also getting married on September 1st

02:54.820 --> 02:56.820
Congratulations. Sorry, no one can crash

02:57.020 --> 03:00.860
But you're invited. Of course, you're both invited. Thank you. If you wanna make it to the courthouse

03:00.860 --> 03:06.280
What if the listeners want to send money and send those to a dark side? Okay

03:07.220 --> 03:12.980
See, I knew that would change your mind a little bit. It would be a Jamie spell J a m ie

03:12.980 --> 03:15.740
i.e. not J-A-I-M-E.

03:15.740 --> 03:16.580
Hello!

03:16.580 --> 03:17.620
Or J-A-M-Y.

03:17.620 --> 03:18.460
No, no, no, no.

03:18.460 --> 03:20.220
Actually, they've been misspelling my name.

03:20.220 --> 03:21.420
Oh, well, yeah.

03:21.420 --> 03:22.740
My name is on our website.

03:22.740 --> 03:24.300
Frickin' spell it right.

03:24.300 --> 03:28.860
J-A-M-I-E at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

03:28.860 --> 03:29.700
And they can send you money.

03:29.700 --> 03:30.740
I'm taking my wedding presents

03:30.740 --> 03:32.140
and Amazon gift certificates.

03:32.140 --> 03:33.300
All right.

03:33.300 --> 03:34.140
Seems I'm not registered anymore.

03:34.140 --> 03:35.740
You'll have to let me know if you actually get anything.

03:35.740 --> 03:36.580
That'll be kinda cool.

03:36.580 --> 03:37.900
That would be kinda cool.

03:37.900 --> 03:40.680
So no other games in between there?

03:40.680 --> 03:46.280
Well, I did play, you know, a couple things with Dan, you know, did nothing major, I played

03:46.280 --> 03:47.280
some PSO.

03:47.280 --> 03:51.560
I just, since I've been so busy trying to get, you know, my school stuff set up, I haven't

03:51.560 --> 03:53.400
been able to dedicate as much time to games.

03:53.400 --> 03:57.020
Now, I hate to call you out on something, but you told me during the three hour show

03:57.020 --> 04:00.760
tonight that you haven't been able to put down that Nintendogs five minute demo.

04:00.760 --> 04:04.440
You know, I played it like, I played it five times.

04:04.440 --> 04:05.440
In the same day.

04:05.440 --> 04:07.280
I thought you said you, like, burned it out, you played it so much.

04:07.280 --> 04:10.440
No, it's just, I was getting frustrated because I kept playing Frisbee with the puppies and

04:10.440 --> 04:13.460
and then it was like, oh, five minutes is up, bing.

04:13.460 --> 04:15.580
Like, ah, I wanna play with puppies.

04:15.580 --> 04:17.540
Just like a little over a week to go.

04:17.540 --> 04:18.380
A little over a week to go.

04:18.380 --> 04:19.960
Puppies.

04:19.960 --> 04:21.580
Loki, what's been going on in your gaming world?

04:21.580 --> 04:25.700
I've been playing lots of games, mostly Burnout 3.

04:25.700 --> 04:28.180
I love that game, every single minute.

04:28.180 --> 04:31.040
I must look like some really hardcore crazy guy at my work

04:31.040 --> 04:34.580
because I bring my PlayStation 2 to work.

04:34.580 --> 04:36.640
I set it up, within a 15 minute break,

04:36.640 --> 04:39.020
we play two races and disassemble it

04:39.020 --> 04:40.060
and take it back upstairs.

04:40.060 --> 04:41.060
Who makes Burnout 3?

04:41.060 --> 04:42.060
EA.

04:42.060 --> 04:44.860
Are they paying you under the table to say good things about it?

04:44.860 --> 04:45.860
No.

04:45.860 --> 04:46.860
It's a great game though.

04:46.860 --> 04:49.740
But it's also, what's awesome about it is they've price reduced it already.

04:49.740 --> 04:50.740
So it's $19.99.

04:50.740 --> 04:51.740
Oh cool.

04:51.740 --> 04:52.740
You can go out and get it.

04:52.740 --> 04:55.420
I'm really anticipating Burnout Revenge, which is coming out in September, which will be

04:55.420 --> 04:56.420
awesome.

04:56.420 --> 05:01.660
Other than that, I've been playing just a variety of import games from Taeku no Tatujin

05:01.660 --> 05:04.860
for the Playstation Portable, which is a lot of fun.

05:04.860 --> 05:08.820
And then I've also been playing, I tried playing a little bit of Genji Dawn the Samurai, which

05:08.820 --> 05:13.820
is going to be coming out here in September, um, really looks cool. I love that game, it's

05:13.820 --> 05:18.340
just so pretty. I just wish I could understand dialogue because I can't read Japanese, but

05:18.340 --> 05:24.700
whatever. And then AmcoX Capcom, which looks disappointing, actually. Really? I thought

05:24.700 --> 05:28.020
it was going to be a cool, like, you know, role playing game type thing. It's a tactical

05:28.020 --> 05:33.180
RPG, and I don't like tactical RPGs. When you say tactical RPG, you mean like Advance

05:33.180 --> 05:37.440
wars like a fancy tactics like my own fancy tactics okay exactly

05:37.440 --> 05:42.620
and uh... it's just i was expecting some different uh... looks the intro movies

05:42.620 --> 05:46.800
cool but never got into like tactics or do you know i i i never did i i don't

05:46.800 --> 05:49.680
like i kinda like those games so i gotta check this out

05:49.680 --> 05:50.800
uh... i don't know but

05:50.800 --> 05:54.440
it'll be cool when it comes out over here and then we look at mark not been

05:54.440 --> 05:55.480
loving again

05:55.480 --> 05:56.680
uh... i'm

05:56.680 --> 05:59.200
good to play in this week away seven writer die

05:59.200 --> 06:02.160
all i tried seven sins to this week uh...

06:02.160 --> 06:05.320
It's like The Sims 2, just with nudity.

06:05.320 --> 06:08.520
Honestly, it's exactly like it.

06:08.520 --> 06:12.240
It's really interesting and very annoying. I'm sure Seven Sins.

06:12.240 --> 06:15.680
I'm sure that made Jack Thompson a very happy man.

06:15.680 --> 06:19.760
Well, it's in Europe. What's he gonna do? Tell the Europeans to stop their games?

06:19.760 --> 06:22.480
They don't care about nudity. Stop being naked all the time!

06:22.480 --> 06:27.440
Next week though, I'm playing 187 Ride or Die and Darkwatch for sure.

06:27.440 --> 06:31.640
You got a busy, busy gaming schedule. I wish my list of games was as impressive,

06:31.640 --> 06:34.800
But sadly, since I've been traveling, all I've had is handhelds.

06:34.800 --> 06:39.960
I finally bought my own copy of Luminous, because it's this long-going story.

06:39.960 --> 06:43.480
If you've listened to the podcast for several weeks now, I bought a copy of Luminous before

06:43.480 --> 06:44.740
I had the PSP.

06:44.740 --> 06:47.560
My friend accidentally took it one weekend.

06:47.560 --> 06:51.320
I ended up just giving it to him as a birthday present, because he loved it so much, and

06:51.320 --> 06:54.440
I finally went and bought my own copy while I was traveling, since I was on the East Coast

06:54.440 --> 06:56.120
for a couple weeks.

06:56.120 --> 06:59.360
I went to a DDR tournament while I was out on the East Coast, and I played a new game

06:59.360 --> 07:03.480
called Percussion Master, which is pretty cool. It's like a cross between Taiko no

07:03.480 --> 07:07.780
Tatujin and Drum Mania, if you're familiar with those games. Taiko Drum

07:07.780 --> 07:13.300
Master was the American name of Taiko no Tatujin. Pretty cool game. I liked it. I

07:13.300 --> 07:17.840
loved the song list. It was fun, but it's a game that I think might wear thin a

07:17.840 --> 07:23.780
little quickly because it doesn't seem to have a whole lot of extra modes and

07:23.780 --> 07:26.620
things, but I didn't really have a chance to really prod around the game. It does

07:26.620 --> 07:30.740
have a very solid song list and I do recommend any music gaming fan check it

07:30.740 --> 07:33.740
out those you guys aren't music gaming fans probably won't ever even find this

07:33.740 --> 07:37.060
game because I don't think it'll probably come out on the homes or

07:37.060 --> 07:40.500
anything I think it's a very small release otherwise I've just been playing

07:40.500 --> 07:45.020
a lot of handheld games I actually tried I kind of forced myself to try and play

07:45.020 --> 07:49.220
some DS games that I originally had given negatives reviews for on the show

07:49.220 --> 07:53.220
one of them being polarium sorry kids still can't get into polarium Yoshi

07:53.220 --> 07:58.860
Touch and Go after playing Kirby Canvas Curse it kind of has a dual effect like

07:58.860 --> 08:02.060
I'm able to understand Yoshi Touch and Go more and I'm able to get a little

08:02.060 --> 08:06.740
better at it and have a little more fun with it but to me it still feels like

08:06.740 --> 08:10.780
you're paying a full price for a game for just like a two level game and I

08:10.780 --> 08:14.660
still can't recommend Yoshi Touch and Go I say if you want a game like that just

08:14.660 --> 08:18.220
get Kirby Canvas Curse it's a much much more solid game so really it's just been

08:18.220 --> 08:21.780
about the handhelds. I still need pack picks. One thing I want to bring up oh I

08:21.780 --> 08:25.700
I want I still need to check out pack pics and I want to check out pack and roll too when that comes out

08:26.100 --> 08:29.500
Pack and roll is fun. One thing I want to definitely mention about PSPs

08:29.500 --> 08:36.620
I used to kind of bash the whole UMD movies on PSP thing as not being a very good idea as what's the point?

08:36.620 --> 08:40.620
I'll tell you what after five-hour flights on Southwest

08:41.220 --> 08:44.320
PSP movies have become my favorite thing ever. I'm so happy

08:44.900 --> 08:51.000
That my friend sharks girl who's been on some of our three hour programs on orange launch radio.com. She loaned me some movies

08:51.000 --> 08:56.900
I finally saw Tron for the first time on PSP and I saw a movie called I robot with Will Smith both great movies

08:57.180 --> 09:01.300
Which I surprised me I robot did not look like the kind of movie. I would like at all and I loved it

09:01.300 --> 09:03.300
I thought it was great. So

09:03.480 --> 09:08.160
PSP movies are awesome. I still am a little weirded out with the whole idea that you pay

09:08.740 --> 09:13.840
$20 for the movie that you're how often you gonna watch the movie on your PSP to really make it worth it

09:13.880 --> 09:19.180
Here's my suggestion and I seriously should like trademark this idea or something before somebody steals it

09:19.180 --> 09:22.060
And I think I might have mentioned this on a three-hour show or something before him

09:22.060 --> 09:25.540
I'm gonna say it again because this is very apparent to me after doing a lot of traveling this weekend

09:26.000 --> 09:28.720
Somebody should start like a rental service

09:29.160 --> 09:35.680
For PSP movies in airports and have these places like in all these airports called altitudes

09:35.800 --> 09:41.460
Do they do they rent? Yes these oh they do they rent and I think they rent and sell DVDs

09:41.460 --> 09:46.440
I thought they only sold them. Well, I'm pretty sure they do. I know they are starting to do UMD games

09:46.440 --> 09:51.440
also I think there was I know there's some place that all the tunes I want to

09:51.440 --> 09:55.040
say is one of them but I can't remember they rent or sell I want to say they do

09:55.040 --> 09:59.000
rent though because you can return them to other altitude stores yeah in

09:59.000 --> 10:03.120
different airports I see something like that for UMDs I bet would make a killing

10:03.120 --> 10:06.680
maybe not right away but when you when PSPs really catch on I think it'd be

10:06.680 --> 10:10.240
great idea oh they they love those portable games man they're buying well

10:10.240 --> 10:14.880
if altitudes adopts that idea they need to send me a dollar or something for

10:14.880 --> 10:19.440
giving the idea anyway let's get into some gaming news tonight boys and girls

10:19.440 --> 10:23.720
starting off with QuakeCon. QuakeCon just happened recently and I heard that

10:23.720 --> 10:25.880
there were some new movies shown for Quake 4

10:25.880 --> 10:29.040
I haven't gotten a chance to see this but apparently the quake fans are all excited

10:29.040 --> 10:29.960
somebody in chat

10:29.960 --> 10:33.540
during the life program this week was really excited about Quake 4. I have seen them

10:33.540 --> 10:36.880
What did you think? They were interesting it looks, Quake

10:36.880 --> 10:40.880
though is starting to look more like Halo just because well I wonder why

10:40.880 --> 10:45.380
Well, it's not surprising. I mean, it's running on the new Doom 3 engine, which is nice.

10:45.380 --> 10:51.380
The movie that I saw is basically, it looks like an all-out war right now.

10:51.380 --> 10:56.880
And you're falling in the trenches with this one guy, and you're basically just kind of shooting these other things.

10:56.880 --> 11:04.880
And you see gunfire going up overhead and stuff. So it looks just like out of Halo 2, basically.

11:04.880 --> 11:06.880
I don't know. It looks good, though.

11:06.880 --> 11:10.380
Here's what I thought was a really cool piece of information that also came out of QuakeCon.

11:10.380 --> 11:14.220
John Carmack actually announced that the Quake 3

11:14.220 --> 11:16.980
source code is going to be released.

11:16.980 --> 11:19.100
Now, remember what the Doom source code

11:19.100 --> 11:20.220
release has done for us.

11:20.220 --> 11:22.220
I mean, now we've got Doom on the iPod and all

11:22.220 --> 11:23.300
this crazy stuff.

11:23.300 --> 11:26.060
This is going to be pretty cool, Quake 3 source.

11:26.060 --> 11:28.780
I'm just wanting to see what they would turn it into.

11:28.780 --> 11:30.740
Yeah, I'm kind of curious to see what kind of side

11:30.740 --> 11:31.820
projects come out of this.

11:31.820 --> 11:33.780
Loki, you're kind of more in the hack and crack thing.

11:33.780 --> 11:36.020
Is this going to be a huge thing, or what do you think

11:36.020 --> 11:37.780
about the Quake 3 source?

11:37.780 --> 11:38.740
I think it would be cool.

11:38.740 --> 11:42.060
I mean, definitely you're going to get some really good games coming out from it.

11:42.060 --> 11:46.140
I mean, just look at all the Quake 2 stuff that you had, you know, coming out in all

11:46.140 --> 11:50.340
the mods and whatnot, and some of the mods becoming their own games and that type of

11:50.340 --> 11:51.340
thing.

11:51.340 --> 11:52.340
Sure.

11:52.340 --> 11:54.340
It couldn't hurt, definitely.

11:54.340 --> 11:56.500
Let's talk about PSP and the firmware.

11:56.500 --> 11:57.820
There's brand new firmware coming out.

11:57.820 --> 12:02.000
It's actually going to come out today, August 15th, the day that our show is released.

12:02.000 --> 12:07.980
It was supposed to be out a couple days ago, but they, you know, just have to wait a little

12:07.980 --> 12:11.720
bit because I guess there were some recent bugs to fix or something.

12:11.720 --> 12:17.100
Just a reminder, the PSP firmware 2.0 will have that new web browser application which

12:17.100 --> 12:23.100
lets you browse the internet on your PSP from any wireless hotspot.

12:23.100 --> 12:24.480
So that's going to be pretty cool.

12:24.480 --> 12:27.280
Also enhanced video and audio playback, they're saying.

12:27.280 --> 12:33.440
Photo sharing options, broader network connectivity, and a more customizable interface.

12:33.440 --> 12:37.400
So a lot of people looking forward to 2.0, but of course the downside of that, if you

12:37.400 --> 12:43.000
upgrade, say goodbye to the NES emulator for a little while, at least until you know they're

12:43.000 --> 12:44.860
going to find a way around the 2.0 fix.

12:44.860 --> 12:45.860
They're working on it already.

12:45.860 --> 12:47.600
Just give it time, I'm sure it'll happen.

12:47.600 --> 12:52.480
Honestly though, if you're going to be upgrading because of a web browser, just wait, because

12:52.480 --> 12:55.280
they're already working on web browsers, hell, there's four already.

12:55.280 --> 12:59.200
I mean, what, if you really want to use a web browser, there's always Wipeout, and there's

12:59.200 --> 13:01.040
already two other ones that they're working on.

13:01.040 --> 13:04.880
Yes, but like, you know, when they release a really popular game for PSP, like let's

13:04.880 --> 13:08.440
say the new Grand Theft Auto game, don't you think these games are going to force you to

13:08.440 --> 13:09.440
go to 2.0?

13:09.440 --> 13:13.360
No, because what they'll do is they'll just dump the ISO of the game, and then you'll

13:13.360 --> 13:15.600
just be able to run it just like normal.

13:15.600 --> 13:19.200
Okay, heaven forbid there should be people out there in the world that buy their games

13:19.200 --> 13:20.200
legally.

13:20.200 --> 13:24.880
Okay, yes, you can still buy the game legally, but you can use your own software to dump

13:24.880 --> 13:27.880
the game and then run it on your memory card.

13:27.880 --> 13:31.400
That's a lot of work just to run Kid Icarus on the PSP, although it is Kid Icarus.

13:31.400 --> 13:35.660
So, I mean, they're getting close, they've already figured out a way to run four gigabyte

13:35.660 --> 13:40.860
memory sticks on there, and those aren't memory stick duos, those are the pro ones, and they

13:40.860 --> 13:42.340
figured out a workaround for that.

13:42.340 --> 13:48.600
So four gigabyte memory stick that, from according to the guy who did it, 15 UMD games he has

13:48.600 --> 13:52.200
on there, plus a whole bunch of homebrew stuff and movies.

13:52.200 --> 13:56.800
To which I'm sure Sony is very excited, and I'll be bringing up a Sony anti-piracy story

13:56.800 --> 14:00.240
a little later, which I'm sure you'll love, but in the meantime, let's hear what's going

14:00.240 --> 14:05.980
on in the hack and crack world. Well, glad you asked, because we're getting closer and

14:05.980 --> 14:12.040
closer to porting Linux to everything, so why not start with the PSP? Of course it's

14:12.040 --> 14:17.900
not really ported, it's just emulated. So we have the x86 emulator, and for those not

14:17.900 --> 14:22.260
in the know, it's basically a PC emulator, you know, DOS based type of thing. So they've

14:22.260 --> 14:27.980
ported over Linux and Windows 95. Windows 95, if I might add, runs very freaking slow.

14:27.980 --> 14:35.220
So wait, hypothetically, if x86 is emulated, you could run like Oregon Trail on your PSP.

14:35.220 --> 14:39.560
You know, honestly, what you could do is they're talking about, you know, okay, well, about

14:39.560 --> 14:44.840
porting Tiger because, you know, all these new things now you can be porting, you know,

14:44.840 --> 14:48.980
Apple's operating system to Intel-based, you know, PCs.

14:48.980 --> 14:54.460
So if in, I mean, it's only a matter of time, I mean, didn't Oregon Trail come out for the

14:54.460 --> 14:55.460
Amiga?

14:55.460 --> 14:56.460
I don't know.

14:56.460 --> 14:57.460
I'm just kidding.

14:57.460 --> 15:02.460
It's gonna come out. Eventually, you'll be able to play Oregon Trail on the PSP.

15:02.460 --> 15:03.460
Hurray!

15:03.460 --> 15:05.460
After all, that's what we're working towards, right?

15:05.460 --> 15:06.460
That's exactly.

15:06.460 --> 15:10.460
I don't give a shit about Halo 3. I want Oregon Trail on the PSP.

15:10.460 --> 15:17.460
You missed it though. Our live show two weeks ago, we had my good friend, customi19, on the show.

15:17.460 --> 15:20.460
By the end of the show, she was playing Oregon Trail on her laptop.

15:20.460 --> 15:22.460
See? Smart woman.

15:22.460 --> 15:26.420
uh-huh other stuff that's going on in the world of the PSP

15:26.420 --> 15:29.660
I'm someone actually made a home version of kaboom

15:29.660 --> 15:34.980
for the PSP rock on rock on kaboom was like the best Atari 2600 game

15:34.980 --> 15:39.260
so simple so simple the concept of the game but ice

15:39.260 --> 15:42.700
but I remember being five years old and just being like totally obsessed

15:42.700 --> 15:46.260
with kaboom well don't get too excited yet it's still got tons of bugs it's the

15:46.260 --> 15:48.000
first game this guy's program it's

15:48.000 --> 15:51.820
program the a language called Lua which you can actually program homebrew games

15:51.820 --> 15:53.500
pretty simple for your PSP.

15:53.500 --> 15:56.700
Okay, plus also the fact that it doesn't have that little dial controller. I'm

15:56.700 --> 15:57.740
sorry, no

15:57.740 --> 16:00.940
other controller works the same as those little dial controllers that you had for

16:00.940 --> 16:02.220
Breakout and stuff.

16:02.220 --> 16:05.940
It'll ruin it for me. Yeah, so you've got that.

16:05.940 --> 16:09.420
So that's one thing you can look at. The other thing is this

16:09.420 --> 16:13.300
operating system, or I should say a GUI that they're making called P6,

16:13.300 --> 16:16.620
which is going to be able to run homebrew stuff and all that wonderful

16:16.620 --> 16:20.500
stuff. Plus they're talking about random wallpapers and yada yada yada.

16:20.500 --> 16:28.020
And then my favorite, Scorched Earth PSP, got a version 0.9 release right now, they've

16:28.020 --> 16:31.920
got more stuff being worked on, a scoring system, that sort of thing.

16:31.920 --> 16:34.180
But it's getting closer, getting closer.

16:34.180 --> 16:38.960
With all due respect, fuck worms, it's all about Scorched Earth.

16:38.960 --> 16:45.080
So yeah, now away from the PSP stuff, we've got SCUMM, which was that wonderful engine

16:45.080 --> 16:50.920
that ran Maniac Mansion in my favorite game, Monkey Island, the Secret Monkey Island, came

16:50.920 --> 16:56.440
to the DS! Perfect! I can't believe that'd be awesome to try that out on the DS with

16:56.440 --> 17:03.440
a touch screen. It runs fantastic from what I hear, and there's info on that on this

17:03.440 --> 17:12.440
nintendo-ds.dcmu.com.uk. I know, no one's gonna get that. Anyways, it's out there, just

17:12.440 --> 17:18.880
rewind listen again okay cool yeah so um really cool stuff very cool all right

17:18.880 --> 17:23.200
let's go to dark Sakura who's got a story for us about well what is this

17:23.200 --> 17:29.480
about really well it's put out by BBC news and I'm glad somebody especially a

17:29.480 --> 17:34.720
prominent you know source like BBC has pointed out that parents ignore game age

17:34.720 --> 17:40.360
ratings surprise big surprise a study commissioned by the UK games industry

17:40.360 --> 17:43.780
found that parents let their children play games for adults even though they

17:43.780 --> 17:49.220
know they are 18 rated. To quote Jurgen Freund, he's a modulum researcher,

17:49.220 --> 17:53.140
most parents think that their child is mature enough so that these games will

17:53.140 --> 17:58.120
not influence them. Parents perceive age ratings as a guide but not as a definite

17:58.120 --> 18:05.980
prohibition. There was a case where when the parents of a 14 year old blamed the

18:05.980 --> 18:12.400
gave manhunt for his death and the police investigated it and dismissed it

18:12.400 --> 18:16.840
as part of the case you know I'm fine with a parent thinking that their child

18:16.840 --> 18:19.920
is smart enough to understand the difference between games in real life

18:19.920 --> 18:24.640
because that should be up to a parent to decide you know because like for

18:24.640 --> 18:28.400
instance there's a lot of kids that are like 13 to 18 that I'm sure listen to

18:28.400 --> 18:31.000
this podcast because I know some of them are listening to the three-hour show and

18:31.000 --> 18:34.080
they're smart kids and I know that they're not gonna do anything stupid

18:34.080 --> 18:38.280
like this guy who killed some guy over a manhunt and I think in that case if a

18:38.280 --> 18:41.760
parent recognizes that then they should be able to play these adult games if

18:41.760 --> 18:47.240
they want but unfortunately it's just those careless parents with careless

18:47.240 --> 18:51.240
children that screw it up for everybody else it's just oh there's also a notice

18:51.240 --> 18:58.080
on here that between January 2003 and July 2004 16 out of the 1208 games on

18:58.080 --> 19:03.760
sale in the UK were given an 18-plus certificate they well did those 16 games

19:03.760 --> 19:05.120
to sell though, I wonder.

19:05.120 --> 19:08.760
Well, they actually interviewed about 1,000 UK adults,

19:08.760 --> 19:10.780
and a further 100 were questioned

19:10.780 --> 19:16.000
after buying a video game that was for 18 Up.

19:16.000 --> 19:19.040
Of course, a comment from a couple of the people,

19:19.040 --> 19:21.400
because they allow you to give comments back on this.

19:21.400 --> 19:26.760
To allow an underage child to play an 18 plus rated game

19:26.760 --> 19:29.040
is irresponsible parenting.

19:29.040 --> 19:31.960
Not, I disagree.

19:31.960 --> 19:36.040
I bet the same person would take their child to an R-rated movie if they screened it first,

19:36.040 --> 19:37.040
you know?

19:37.040 --> 19:38.040
Or if they knew something about it.

19:38.040 --> 19:40.880
And I think if a parent knows a little something about the game, although of course this story

19:40.880 --> 19:46.680
talks about ignoring ratings, but I think if the parent knows that their child can differentiate

19:46.680 --> 19:51.720
between violence in a video game and violence in the real world, I think that's a parent's

19:51.720 --> 19:53.720
decision.

19:53.720 --> 19:59.360
There's also another one on here that says often media hype builds games up to be worse

19:59.360 --> 20:00.360
than they are.

20:00.360 --> 20:01.360
Thank you!

20:01.360 --> 20:03.360
Oh, oh, yeah. Hello

20:03.760 --> 20:06.220
Absolutely. That's right. I think back to

20:07.400 --> 20:10.440
Remember we read a story a couple weeks ago on air about the blind

20:10.600 --> 20:16.960
guy who was playing games and kicking people's asses Soulcalibur 2 and the media said that he'd play Soulcalibur 2 and

20:17.600 --> 20:20.380
Decapitate people in the game, which is not something you do in that game

20:20.800 --> 20:25.980
Actually, I want to go ahead and read his quote in full if I may sure the guys name is Kenny's from Nottingham

20:25.980 --> 20:30.260
He says the violence in video games is often of a cartoon nature.

20:30.260 --> 20:34.300
The outcry over Manhunt was laughable because the game was rubbish and wouldn't have sold

20:34.300 --> 20:38.340
at all but for the furor in the press.

20:38.340 --> 20:41.860
Often media hype builds games up to be worse than they are, and by doing so makes them

20:41.860 --> 20:44.960
must-have games that they do not deserve to be.

20:44.960 --> 20:49.620
Grand Theft Auto San Andreas is no different in theme to its two predecessors, but its

20:49.620 --> 20:52.460
notoriety ensured its success.

20:52.460 --> 21:08.460
I have something to add to this. There's also a related story. There was a study done in the University of Illinois, and they found no strong link between violent video games and aggression.

21:08.460 --> 21:23.460
They basically did a survey watching players play this game, Astrone's Call 2, a popular MMORPG, and basically saying that the results were that no one showed signs of wanting to kill people afterwards.

21:23.460 --> 21:25.460
I'd go crazy if I was stuck having to play Astrone's Call.

21:28.460 --> 21:35.460
I know somebody who played Astrone's Call all day, all night, and she was as calm and sociable as could be.

21:35.460 --> 21:48.460
Once again, I'd like to mention too, and I was noticing when reading that article that Dark Sakura was talking about in the comments section there, people were saying, you know, there's got to be a way, you know, with DVDs nowadays, you can lock out different DVDs that are, you know, raiding.

21:48.460 --> 21:49.460
They're built into the consoles.

21:49.460 --> 21:58.460
I know, that's what I'm saying. All these age, you know, prevention things, you know, for mature games, it's all programmed into the consoles. You can lock out content.

21:58.460 --> 21:59.460
You have to have a code to get into it.

21:59.460 --> 22:09.460
Yeah, you can lock this stuff out for your kids, so if you're worried about your kids playing games, you know, because you're not supervising them, which you should be doing in the first place, you can lock this stuff out.

22:09.460 --> 22:17.460
It's on every single console system, I think from the Playstation up through the PSP now. It's just, it's ridiculous.

22:17.460 --> 22:20.820
it's ridiculous. Wow. There's also one parent

22:20.820 --> 22:24.500
who replied on this one that talks about how the kids are swapping games with

22:24.500 --> 22:25.780
each other too and so

22:25.780 --> 22:28.900
they even don't have any control over that because their kids are taking the

22:28.900 --> 22:31.740
initiative. That's a very interesting point but at the same time

22:31.740 --> 22:35.420
the parents should still be you know aware of what games their kids are

22:35.420 --> 22:35.980
playing.

22:35.980 --> 22:39.700
You know. There's another comment on here, this is the last one I'm going to read by

22:39.700 --> 22:40.780
Vicky in Glasgow.

22:40.780 --> 22:45.340
She says, I definitely agree with the idea that an 18 plus certificate on a

22:45.340 --> 22:47.260
game makes it more desirable.

22:47.260 --> 22:51.220
My stepson is instantly drawn to the game that he is not allowed to play

22:51.220 --> 22:55.580
and it is a problem amongst his peers. In fact, it makes an even greater problem

22:55.580 --> 22:57.900
when they are allowed to play these games at friends' houses

22:57.900 --> 23:01.820
with the blessing of friends' parents but without our knowledge or consent.

23:01.820 --> 23:06.500
Very interesting point there. Kids are sneaky! A very interesting point as well that

23:06.500 --> 23:06.940
the

23:06.940 --> 23:10.340
mature rating makes us want to play the games more.

23:10.340 --> 23:13.380
Think about would anybody have ever bought the guy game?

23:13.380 --> 23:21.060
I seriously they call it the sweet 18 and the sweet 18 in Europe basically you

23:21.060 --> 23:27.340
know 18 plus games sell better 18 sweet all right let's move on I want to

23:27.340 --> 23:30.700
mention something going on in another MMO I'm astronauts call to got brought

23:30.700 --> 23:35.060
up in that previous story EverQuest 2 I want to mention this apparently there

23:35.060 --> 23:39.100
was a big group of hackers that illegally created like currency and

23:39.100 --> 23:45.220
EverQuest 2 and ended up causing the game's economy to suffer by 20% in just

23:45.220 --> 23:50.140
24 hours of course then they finally got caught. Chris Cramer the director of

23:50.140 --> 23:55.220
public relations for EverQuest 2 said that they had a duping bug that made

23:55.220 --> 24:00.340
large quantities of platinum the game's currency the amount of money in the game

24:00.340 --> 24:08.060
was increased by a fifth in about 24 hours hmm very interesting so that's

24:08.060 --> 24:13.940
that EverQuest 2 is not a game that I've really played a whole lot but I guess if

24:13.940 --> 24:18.780
you do play that game that must have sucked to have that happen kind of

24:18.780 --> 24:23.020
strange thinking of such a virtual environment is having its own economy I

24:23.020 --> 24:27.800
know I know you know when you stop it just think about that it's like oh my

24:27.800 --> 24:32.660
god but but it's a huge part of any MMO Wow has its economy

24:32.660 --> 24:39.600
Final Fantasy 11 or any of them. Well but actually PSO though really doesn't

24:39.600 --> 24:45.120
because you because there's no auction house in PSO exactly that's you have

24:45.120 --> 24:51.200
game controlled shops and basically the only way to really you know players can

24:51.200 --> 24:55.160
sell stuff to each other but that's really the only way D it's more of a

24:55.160 --> 25:00.000
barter system and so there's no real economy to manipulate there. I prefer

25:00.000 --> 25:03.440
that actually over the auction house thing though actually that they did

25:03.440 --> 25:09.000
limit the total amount of currency you can hold in a blue burst compared to the

25:09.000 --> 25:13.480
Xbox just an FYI because I don't want to get any hate mail over this the economy

25:13.480 --> 25:18.120
of the game was brought back to normal after the thing was discovered so if

25:18.120 --> 25:20.840
you're an EverQuest 2 player everything's a-okay you can go back to

25:20.840 --> 25:23.480
your ever questing now enjoy your crack and your slash pizza

25:23.480 --> 25:28.480
enjoy your crack and your slash pizza all right I know one thing we enjoy not

25:28.480 --> 25:32.160
just our slash pizza but we enjoy getting mail from our listeners so let's

25:32.160 --> 25:36.280
hear what the folks who send us some email at to go to go at orange lounge

25:36.280 --> 25:41.680
radio.com had to say this week dark Sakura what kind of lovely mail do we get

25:41.680 --> 25:47.880
this week we have an email from a person named I hope I don't mispronounce this

25:47.880 --> 25:52.400
Yannick hey guys regarding the media player that Loki mentioned on the last

25:52.400 --> 25:56.160
podcast I have purchased the original media player back when I first got my

25:56.160 --> 25:59.800
PlayStation 2 and didn't really know what to expect since it came from mad

25:59.800 --> 26:04.840
cats and I have a bad history with them however this product is very reliable if

26:04.840 --> 26:08.900
your computer is fast enough to stream the video over to your ps2 and if the

26:08.900 --> 26:13.800
video is at the 320 by 240 resolution basically going over this saying that

26:13.800 --> 26:20.500
Java stuff's buggy but it the bad cats one worked just fine alrighty the one I

26:20.500 --> 26:23.280
was talking about though it's a little different than the media player he's

26:23.280 --> 26:26.960
talking about. The one I talked about was actually streaming stuff off the Playstation

26:26.960 --> 26:33.320
hard drive that you put in there. So, similar, but I think you can do the same type of thing.

26:33.320 --> 26:40.320
Any other emails you want to share? Um, we also got one from someone named Blake, who

26:41.360 --> 26:48.160
writes us from Atlanta, Georgia. Hotlanta! Hey, I've been to Atlanta plenty of times.

26:48.160 --> 26:52.360
I used to stay with relatives over in Alpharetta.

26:52.360 --> 26:57.600
I got cousins in Augusta, other than a bit of a drive from there.

26:57.600 --> 27:00.280
You just started listening to our show a few weeks ago.

27:00.280 --> 27:01.280
Great job.

27:01.280 --> 27:03.400
You're one of the two podcasts I listen to.

27:03.400 --> 27:04.400
Well, um...

27:04.400 --> 27:05.400
What's the other one?

27:05.400 --> 27:06.400
No, I'm just kidding.

27:06.400 --> 27:07.400
There's a lot of great podcasts there.

27:07.400 --> 27:08.400
I'm quoting.

27:08.400 --> 27:11.160
Well anyways, listened to your latest show and you were ranting about the game ratings

27:11.160 --> 27:12.520
so I completely agree with you guys.

27:12.520 --> 27:15.560
I'm 13 and my parents let me play any game I want.

27:15.560 --> 27:19.640
Back when I was around 3 years old, my dad talked to me about game ratings and told me

27:19.640 --> 27:22.360
it was all fake and just a game.

27:22.360 --> 27:25.000
Been playing Doom since I was 2, literally.

27:25.000 --> 27:28.100
The only games they don't let me play are the ones with nudity and sex.

27:28.100 --> 27:32.760
I'm stuck playing my God of War demo for PS2 since I can't get God of War due to the threesome.

27:32.760 --> 27:35.240
Luckily, the GTA games never appealed to me.

27:35.240 --> 27:39.680
I think you guys should talk more about Bimani since there's a lot of news coming up lately

27:39.680 --> 27:42.720
and I'm a huge fan of DDR and every other music game ever created.

27:42.720 --> 27:48.520
I think that you should go to the PTA meetings and tell parents they aren't doing their jobs.

27:48.520 --> 27:49.520
That's what we talked about last week.

27:49.520 --> 27:50.520
That's great.

27:50.520 --> 27:51.520
That's great.

27:51.520 --> 27:55.040
We said we were going to go march up on the PTA meetings and say, hey!

27:55.040 --> 28:00.160
That's really interesting about the fact that the dad had to talk with him when he was really

28:00.160 --> 28:01.160
young and that's good.

28:01.160 --> 28:04.520
And you know what else is really good about that is that, you know, how would the parents

28:04.520 --> 28:06.960
know that God of War has a threesome?

28:06.960 --> 28:11.560
What's to stop this kid from going out and getting the game and just saying, oh, that

28:11.560 --> 28:15.640
means the parents did their work exactly you know Blake tell your parents that

28:15.640 --> 28:19.040
they are doing a fabulous job and they get the dark soccer seal of approval

28:19.040 --> 28:22.000
there you go but I think Blake sounds mature enough where you can handle a

28:22.000 --> 28:25.040
little oops they're just boobs come on pixel a boobs I mean come on they're

28:25.040 --> 28:30.640
fake there's boobs but you know I do have I really really need to point out

28:30.640 --> 28:36.320
this family as a prime example of doing it the right way and on top of that most

28:36.320 --> 28:39.000
kids are smart enough that they know I think they know the difference between

28:39.000 --> 28:45.880
what's real and what's not hopefully polygon representation of boobs they

28:45.880 --> 28:50.520
aren't really fleshy boobs you have to wait a few years for that do you have

28:50.520 --> 28:53.640
another email you want to read there sir I know I have one I have one I

28:53.640 --> 28:58.160
definitely want to throw in here somebody sent an email Noah is the name

28:58.160 --> 29:03.560
or N for short and was mentioning that I'm getting back into Final Fantasy 11

29:03.560 --> 29:06.520
at some point and was inviting me to come play on the fairy server with them

29:06.520 --> 29:13.520
I know because like I used to I used to make jokes about the ferry server on the three the three-hour show it has the

29:14.120 --> 29:18.440
Server it has nothing to do with you a kind person who wrote this email

29:18.440 --> 29:23.480
It's just it goes back to this whole live journal drama thing and RPG got it people who roleplay on

29:23.840 --> 29:28.160
Final Fantasy 11 and just it was just and not that I'm sorry

29:28.160 --> 29:31.600
I take that back not that there's anything wrong with role-playing on Final Fantasy 11

29:31.600 --> 29:34.480
But people who take it a little bit too far so that is wrong

29:34.480 --> 29:39.480
There's nothing wrong, as long as you know the difference between reality and Final Fantasy 11.

29:39.480 --> 29:41.480
You know what, I would...

29:41.480 --> 29:48.480
And this person says that they've been playing since the US PlayStation 2 release, and they're a level 22 slash 11 warrior monk.

29:48.480 --> 29:55.480
And they got in there, and this person's inviting me because they don't seem to know a whole lot of people that actually play the game as well.

29:55.480 --> 29:57.480
I totally appreciate the invite, that's great.

29:57.480 --> 30:03.480
And I actually had a character on the Faria server for a little while because there's a large contingent on there that I like.

30:03.480 --> 30:08.080
there that I like playing the games with and but I just it's not the same people

30:08.080 --> 30:11.160
that were on Bismarck which is the server I was on and I've been smart crowd

30:11.160 --> 30:14.480
was good I've gotten I've gotten invites for well of course there's Bismarck I've

30:14.480 --> 30:19.680
gotten invites for fairy invites for cerebras and invites for Garuda so it's

30:19.680 --> 30:22.240
tough it's tough when there's all these servers I really wish that found a

30:22.240 --> 30:26.620
Squeenix at least would let you server hop it would be great so I really

30:26.620 --> 30:30.160
appreciate the invite and but I if I go back to the game I'm gonna have to go

30:30.160 --> 30:31.560
back to my family at Bismarck.

30:31.560 --> 30:33.520
However, if you would like to come on over

30:33.520 --> 30:35.260
to the Bismarck server with us,

30:35.260 --> 30:36.720
that's assuming if I even get back into the game

30:36.720 --> 30:37.560
in the first place.

30:37.560 --> 30:38.860
I still haven't decided on that.

30:38.860 --> 30:41.620
Send me an email, rob at orangelandrater.com

30:41.620 --> 30:43.400
and I'll get you a world pass on to Bismarck.

30:43.400 --> 30:45.840
And plus you can still add me to your play online list

30:45.840 --> 30:47.200
and we can send messages back and forth

30:47.200 --> 30:49.760
and talk about how the economy on our server suck.

30:49.760 --> 30:51.320
So thank you for the invite.

30:51.320 --> 30:53.440
I had installed play online.

30:53.440 --> 30:54.520
I know you did.

30:54.520 --> 30:56.440
All right, do you have any more?

30:56.440 --> 30:57.760
PS opium.

30:57.760 --> 30:58.600
No.

30:58.600 --> 30:59.420
All right.

30:59.420 --> 31:02.320
bag once again to go to go at orange

31:11.400 --> 31:12.760
appropriate party I'm gonna reply to

31:12.760 --> 31:14.160
this person as well because that was

31:14.160 --> 31:15.920
nice to invite ya and I feel bad that I

31:15.920 --> 31:17.600
have to say no but there's just too

31:17.600 --> 31:20.040
damn many servers on file phase 11 low

31:20.040 --> 31:21.860
keep writing us yeah I appreciate the

31:21.860 --> 31:23.920
email Loki you um you have a story about

31:23.920 --> 31:26.080
the DS and it's gonna get cheaper soon

31:26.080 --> 31:28.920
right yep what's gonna be dropping by

31:28.920 --> 31:35.040
$20 to $130, and they're saying around August 21st is when that's going to happen, and the

31:35.040 --> 31:38.280
other thing is, well what's Sony going to do then?

31:38.280 --> 31:41.960
They're thinking about, because I know the Playstation 2 is dropping down to $99 pretty

31:41.960 --> 31:42.960
soon.

31:42.960 --> 31:43.960
Nice.

31:43.960 --> 31:50.880
And they're hoping that that's going to steal some of Xbox 360's thunder, right?

31:50.880 --> 31:53.780
Yeah, I don't think so.

31:53.780 --> 31:55.840
So yeah, that's going to be happening.

31:55.840 --> 32:00.120
But um, hey, Cheaper DS, Nintendogs, that's not a bad combo.

32:00.120 --> 32:01.120
Puppies!

32:01.120 --> 32:03.820
I think they're kind of smart, I think they're really pushing this Nintendogs thing, I know

32:03.820 --> 32:07.560
we have not shut up about this game on the show for several weeks, but there's a reason

32:07.560 --> 32:11.680
for that guys, this game is, it's different.

32:11.680 --> 32:14.520
It's the next Pokemon, next Pokemon, I tell ya.

32:14.520 --> 32:15.520
I think so too.

32:15.520 --> 32:19.880
And wait til the commercials come, wait til the commercials come, and the little puppies

32:19.880 --> 32:24.560
come up on the screen and the little girls are, Daddy, Daddy, I want the game, I want

32:24.560 --> 32:26.560
The Poppy Game! Poppy Game!

32:54.560 --> 32:58.280
Basically what it is, is they're asking that folks do a short little test.

32:58.280 --> 33:03.520
It's a simple survey and a download on Nintendo.com, okay?

33:03.520 --> 33:06.200
And basically what happens is that it's gonna ask for

33:06.200 --> 33:08.280
information on your Internet connection.

33:08.280 --> 33:12.040
And all the download does is it just pings Nintendo's servers.

33:12.040 --> 33:14.320
And to kind of entice you to do it,

33:14.320 --> 33:18.560
it doubles as a Animal Crossing themed desktop clock.

33:18.560 --> 33:20.280
So a little cute thing there.

33:20.280 --> 33:20.960
That's cool.

33:20.960 --> 33:23.880
Yeah, and basically what they're saying here on Nintendo's website,

33:23.880 --> 33:27.880
by gathering information on which types of networking equipment our customers

33:27.880 --> 33:28.540
are using

33:28.540 --> 33:32.580
and how they have their home network set up, we'll be able to tailor the Nintendo

33:32.580 --> 33:33.740
Wi-Fi connection

33:33.740 --> 33:37.080
to be easy to use and available to the broadest audience possible.

33:37.080 --> 33:42.600
Well that's awfully considerate of them. Yes. Also the FAQ also says by the end of 2005

33:42.600 --> 33:44.440
Nintendo DS owners will be able to play

33:44.440 --> 33:48.960
via Wi-Fi, Mario Kart DS, and Animal Crossing DS.

33:48.960 --> 33:52.480
So if you want to help Nintendo out, you want to help those guys out, head on over to

33:52.480 --> 33:54.760
Nintendo.com and download the Animal Crossing desktop.

33:54.760 --> 33:59.280
I forgot to mention, coming in this fall when they do the price drop, they're going to be

33:59.280 --> 34:05.640
offering a Nintendo DS package where you can get the DS Plus Metro Prime Hunters, not the

34:05.640 --> 34:10.200
demo, Metro Prime Hunters for $150.

34:10.200 --> 34:12.280
And what's, any more colors?

34:12.280 --> 34:14.320
I'm surprised we haven't really heard any...

34:14.320 --> 34:17.760
Uh, no, just that, what is it, blue and red, I think that was it.

34:17.760 --> 34:18.760
Yeah.

34:18.760 --> 34:19.760
We haven't really seen the red though.

34:19.760 --> 34:21.720
I want the graphite one, because the graphite one's just cool.

34:21.720 --> 34:25.240
I'm kinda surprised. I'm surprised that we're even getting excited about colors.

34:25.240 --> 34:27.240
There'll be more colors, don't worry.

34:27.240 --> 34:31.160
Where's the clear one? That's what I'm surprised about. All those first advanced,

34:31.160 --> 34:34.880
the Game Boy Advance, remember the old one? They were like all clear. I don't know.

34:34.880 --> 34:38.400
Anyway. I still have my pink one with my afterburner in it.

34:38.400 --> 34:42.440
When about the micro? When's that coming out?

34:42.440 --> 34:46.720
Eventually. I think by end of year, but I don't- Dumbest idea ever.

34:46.720 --> 34:50.920
I don't think so. I think- I don't think it's a dumb idea, but I don't think it's

34:50.920 --> 34:52.840
it's gonna do well for him.

34:52.840 --> 34:55.120
But we'll see, we might get proven wrong.

34:55.120 --> 34:58.080
All right, kids, you know what we gotta do now

34:58.080 --> 35:00.240
at this point is that we need Dark Sakura

35:00.240 --> 35:02.960
to give you guys a little piece of her mind

35:02.960 --> 35:04.360
in the formative advice column,

35:04.360 --> 35:06.600
because if we talked about video games

35:06.600 --> 35:08.240
all the time on this show,

35:08.240 --> 35:10.460
we would have no time to go around

35:10.460 --> 35:13.320
and find out the dark lives of strippers.

35:13.320 --> 35:14.920
And those of you guys that listen to the three hour show

35:14.920 --> 35:16.520
know exactly what we're talking about.

35:16.520 --> 35:17.920
The dark side is bleach.

35:17.920 --> 35:20.920
And if you don't know what we're talking about,

35:20.920 --> 35:22.640
you should start listening.

35:22.640 --> 35:25.480
Sunday nights, 930 Pacific Standard Time.

35:25.480 --> 35:28.460
Anyway, Dark Sakura, what are you gonna talk to us about

35:28.460 --> 35:30.300
on this podcast?

35:30.300 --> 35:33.680
Today's bit of advice is how to deal with a stalker.

35:33.680 --> 35:38.200
This is dedicated to my stalker, BlairisKing on DDR Free.

35:38.200 --> 35:39.820
Bravo.

35:39.820 --> 35:42.400
Number one, firmly inform the stalker

35:42.400 --> 35:44.320
that if the unwanted behavior persists,

35:44.320 --> 35:45.880
you will take action.

35:45.880 --> 35:52.740
threaten to contact authorities, or be a larger, stronger friend or relative. Be prepared to

35:52.740 --> 35:57.860
do so. Do not give in to any threats and be ready to secure a restraining order or civil

35:57.860 --> 36:01.620
protection order if it becomes necessary for your peace of mind.

36:01.620 --> 36:05.460
2. Inform your family, friends, and co-workers of the situation.

36:05.460 --> 36:10.200
3. Keep a paper trail. Save any relevant letters, notes, emails,

36:10.200 --> 36:14.920
and voicemails. Maintain a log or diary of your stalker's actions and report any unlawful

36:14.920 --> 36:19.080
behavior to the police immediately. Report phone calls to both the phone

36:19.080 --> 36:23.880
company and the police. 4. Inform authorities. Do not let fear of

36:23.880 --> 36:28.600
retribution stop you from taking action. Take legal action immediately. But my

36:28.600 --> 36:34.840
final piece of advice... No means no? PISS OFF!

36:37.480 --> 36:42.200
Scary! This story will come as no surprise to any of you but Capcom has

36:42.200 --> 36:46.880
announced that they are officially doing Megaman Battle Network 6 I really don't

36:46.880 --> 36:50.280
know well I really don't know what else to say about that I mean there's a lot

36:50.280 --> 36:58.560
of folks there's a lot of folks that are cooler is that name I can't I don't know

36:58.560 --> 37:02.720
but they are Capcom this is one reason I bring it up Capcom is saying the battle

37:02.720 --> 37:07.980
network 6 will be the series climax possibly suggesting that it will be the

37:07.980 --> 37:14.980
Good, and they can get back to making more Mega Man Legends games, because those games

37:14.980 --> 37:15.980
rocked.

37:15.980 --> 37:17.980
By the way, Legends is coming to the PSP.

37:17.980 --> 37:20.700
I just want more Mega Man X.

37:20.700 --> 37:21.700
I forgot about that.

37:21.700 --> 37:22.700
I'm totally going to have to get that.

37:22.700 --> 37:25.500
And I want it all 2D.

37:25.500 --> 37:31.980
Also in the world of Captain Obvious Presents, Zelda will be made for the revolution.

37:31.980 --> 37:34.440
I mean, come on, duh.

37:34.440 --> 37:37.940
And in other news, there will be a Mario game for the revolution.

37:37.940 --> 37:38.940
That's not official.

37:38.940 --> 37:39.940
That's not official.

37:39.940 --> 37:40.940
And there will probably be a Donkey Kong game.

37:40.940 --> 37:41.940
That's not official.

37:41.940 --> 37:42.940
Stop spreading rumors.

37:42.940 --> 37:43.940
And Smash Brothers.

37:43.940 --> 37:44.940
Stop spreading rumors.

37:44.940 --> 37:45.940
This is the official.

37:45.940 --> 37:47.940
Metroid will make its way to the revolution.

37:47.940 --> 37:48.940
And another Banjo-Kazooie.

37:48.940 --> 37:52.620
This is the official news, kids.

37:52.620 --> 37:59.600
And this is mentioned in an interview with game designer EJ Anuma in Club Nintendo, the

37:59.600 --> 38:02.500
company's official magazine in Latin America.

38:02.500 --> 38:07.300
About Zelda on Revolution, Mr. Owada has assigned me with the task of doing a Zelda game for

38:07.300 --> 38:16.580
the upcoming platform and that is our Duh News of the Week. Dark Sakura, what's

38:16.580 --> 38:23.540
going on overseas for our friends in the UK? Well, first of all, Electronic Arts is

38:23.540 --> 38:28.900
going to be bringing out everybody loves, oh sorry, we love Katamari. You were about

38:28.900 --> 38:32.500
to say everybody loves Katamari. Well, I was thinking Mina Daisuke Katamari.

38:32.500 --> 38:35.500
Because that's how I came to think of it.

38:35.500 --> 38:38.500
Um, yeah, Electronic Arts is going to be publishing that.

38:38.500 --> 38:42.500
I don't actually see anything about the first Katamari Damacy, though.

38:42.500 --> 38:44.500
Didn't they finally get it, but, like, way later?

38:44.500 --> 38:46.500
I think, yeah, way later.

38:46.500 --> 38:50.500
But, um, at any rate, it's going to be put out by EA instead of Namco.

38:50.500 --> 38:54.500
Um, which Namco is bringing out, um, our version next month.

38:54.500 --> 38:55.500
Hooray!

38:55.500 --> 38:57.500
Um, but now, this isn't...

38:57.500 --> 38:59.500
EA typically does this for Namco.

38:59.500 --> 39:01.500
There's a lot of their games that they have done overseas.

39:01.500 --> 39:06.340
So this but this is just good news for our buddies in the UK that they will see this game sooner rather than later

39:06.660 --> 39:10.900
Well, there's a funny little parody picture. This is we love katamari street

39:15.060 --> 39:18.940
Hopefully that hopefully that won't be the game coming out in the UK

39:18.940 --> 39:25.300
Hopefully I love though if ever you look on the Japanese cover, you know, and there's big scans of it online

39:25.980 --> 39:28.980
You know, it's all the Namco employees out in front of it

39:28.980 --> 39:33.680
But if you look in the windows reflected on the windows is the king of all cosmos taking the picture

39:33.680 --> 39:38.160
Oh, that's cool. You know, I I didn't get a chance to say this since I wasn't here last week

39:38.160 --> 39:40.900
But I hate the American box art. It's awful

39:40.900 --> 39:46.400
I haven't seen it actually it's it's kind of hidden and that parody graphic. It's kind of hidden. It's awful

39:46.400 --> 39:51.480
I hope it I hope it was just a mock-up done by some game company because I did not care for the box art at

39:51.480 --> 39:55.440
All I've seen the box art. It's it looks like it was done in MS Paint

39:55.440 --> 40:01.720
It's no the box are I think for the new one is the Japanese, but it's with us. Oh, I hope you're right

40:01.720 --> 40:07.760
I think it is I could have sworn I've seen it, but I again. I hope you're right and I'm looking crack

40:07.760 --> 40:10.960
This is just yeah, that could be true true as well. All right

40:12.520 --> 40:17.880
Any more UK news dark soccer. I'm also the the game premiered on

40:17.880 --> 40:24.000
the Yahoo UK and Ireland video games is The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe for

40:24.000 --> 40:31.720
PS2. It's actually still in production but the review of it is just an awesome

40:31.720 --> 40:36.920
review. I mean they are really singing its praises. One thing though that

40:36.920 --> 40:40.760
I actually focused on in this that really appeals to me, you know, if you've

40:40.760 --> 40:43.580
read The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe it has, you know, for being a

40:43.580 --> 40:47.200
children's book, it has a very dark undertone to it and that's what they're

40:47.200 --> 40:53.400
focusing on they're trying to bring that out yet get to the positive at the end

40:53.400 --> 40:56.560
yes Loki you were telling me at some point that you had actually gotten to

40:56.560 --> 41:02.000
play this game it's somehow briefly like briefly five minutes worth it looked

41:02.000 --> 41:07.240
very interesting it reminded me very much of the Lord of the Rings game just

41:07.240 --> 41:12.320
the way that was because it was kind of that isometric top-down type of thing

41:12.320 --> 41:17.120
and it looked pretty good I mean it looked good I honestly don't remember

41:17.120 --> 41:21.280
much of the lion witch in the wardrobe I read all the books like way back in

41:21.280 --> 41:25.960
elementary school but that's all gone I just know there's a wardrobe involved

41:25.960 --> 41:30.800
in a lion and a witch and that's about it well duh all right should be

41:30.800 --> 41:35.400
interesting also the one that I was really big into is you know that e3 was

41:35.400 --> 41:41.360
called the official site is up call of kulu.com coming out September I was

41:41.360 --> 41:44.040
to say, isn't that game coming out very soon? I saw it on the calendar.

41:44.040 --> 41:48.320
Yeah, pretty soon. And, uh, but if for any, because I know I've been gushing about the

41:48.320 --> 41:53.000
game, but you can, uh, go to callofcathulu.com to check out the official art, uh, background

41:53.000 --> 41:57.800
on the Cthulhu myth, uh, you know, myth, the, there's downloads on there. It's a great site.

41:57.800 --> 42:00.160
Awesome. Anything else?

42:00.160 --> 42:01.640
Um, one last thing.

42:01.640 --> 42:02.640
Sure.

42:02.640 --> 42:08.680
Um, not necessarily specifically related to you, eh, to the UK, but, um, Koay, who was

42:08.680 --> 42:13.400
pull out one of my favorite games ever, K.O. Yogekutai, K.O. Flying Squadron, back on the

42:13.400 --> 42:14.560
Sega CD.

42:14.560 --> 42:20.840
And I remember them for Romance in Three Kingdoms, Nobunaga's Ambition, that's it.

42:20.840 --> 42:24.880
They were at Tokyo Game Show and announced their lineup.

42:24.880 --> 42:30.960
To quote my source, let's just say, we hope you like Dynasty Warriors.

42:30.960 --> 42:35.880
Coming out, we have Dynasty Warriors 5 Special, working title for the Xbox 360, coming to

42:35.880 --> 42:37.380
Japan this winter.

42:37.380 --> 42:43.380
We have Dynasty Warriors 5 Extreme Legends on PS2, September 15th in Japan, Dynasty Warriors

42:43.380 --> 42:46.620
DS, without a release date yet.

42:46.620 --> 42:55.260
Outside of Dynasty Warriors we also have Nioh Summer 2006, Win Back 2, Project Poseidon,

42:55.260 --> 43:00.700
Romance of the Three Kingdoms for the DS, which will be September 2005, and then also

43:00.700 --> 43:06.580
for the Japan only releases, there's Uncharted Waters Online for PC and Nobunaga's Ambition

43:06.580 --> 43:12.620
online here you know show so they're bringing out a couple of them as you

43:12.620 --> 43:17.140
were five for the PlayStation 2 is coming out in September Wow all right

43:17.140 --> 43:25.020
us all right Loki um I know you've got a story about halo 3 yes halo 3 there's

43:25.020 --> 43:30.860
been some rumors coming out of the bungee employee area there they've

43:30.860 --> 43:35.700
basically said it's gonna be more darker and grittier than the previous games

43:35.700 --> 43:41.620
games, they want to actually have an online cooperative part of the game, which would

43:41.620 --> 43:45.840
be fighting bots, which is really interesting, and that's part of the story line, which is

43:45.840 --> 43:46.840
really cool.

43:46.840 --> 43:50.220
A lot more cinematics, would, you know, that'd be cool.

43:50.220 --> 43:53.960
Oh god, the first one was practically a movie as it was.

43:53.960 --> 43:54.960
Multiplayer mode...

43:54.960 --> 43:56.900
Sorry, not the first one.

43:56.900 --> 43:57.900
The second one.

43:57.900 --> 43:59.620
The first one I really played a whole lot, yes.

43:59.620 --> 44:04.840
They're gonna have multiplayer mode with up to 50 players online, which, that's been done

44:04.840 --> 44:10.520
already because the last game that came out, Delta Force Live Black Hawk Down, up to 50

44:10.520 --> 44:11.520
players online.

44:11.520 --> 44:16.320
I've seen some on PC that are like 100, so that's not too big a deal, but I'm not surprised

44:16.320 --> 44:20.800
that they're going up to 50 players because the big team battle games that are the 16

44:20.800 --> 44:24.360
players are really popular, so I'm not surprised they're going to take it a step further.

44:24.360 --> 44:25.360
This was a bit interesting.

44:25.360 --> 44:31.200
They're attempting to implement both a map editor and a movie maker, Sons Red vs. Blue.

44:31.200 --> 44:32.200
Wow.

44:32.200 --> 44:37.560
That reeks of fan-planted rumor to me.

44:37.560 --> 44:38.560
I hope it's true.

44:38.560 --> 44:39.560
That would be pretty funny.

44:39.560 --> 44:40.560
You never know.

44:40.560 --> 44:44.360
I mean, it could be, they've gotten good re- I mean, hello, Red vs. Blue is practically

44:44.360 --> 44:45.360
disposed of.

44:45.360 --> 44:46.360
Yeah, but Red vs. Blue.

44:46.360 --> 44:47.360
And we still have the strangerhood.

44:47.360 --> 44:49.600
Red vs. Blue should stay Red vs. Blue.

44:49.600 --> 44:52.960
But I don't think it's, I don't think it, I think it's more of like, kind of, they do

44:52.960 --> 44:55.760
some really cool combat footage or whatever, anyways.

44:55.760 --> 44:56.760
Super thingy.

44:56.760 --> 45:01.040
They were also going to say that Zanzibar Sidewinder and Hang'em High are set to return

45:01.040 --> 45:05.520
in multiplayer mode, completely reworked, Zanzibar will be mangled and torn apart as

45:05.520 --> 45:09.600
though after a battle, the sky will be dark and red, Seinwender is going to have four

45:09.600 --> 45:14.200
legs instead of just the two with bases at each end, and Hang'em High will have a massive

45:14.200 --> 45:18.120
tree at its center and the structure will be deteriorated.

45:18.120 --> 45:21.400
They do some pretty interesting things when they make the maps return from the old games.

45:21.400 --> 45:22.400
That's cool.

45:22.400 --> 45:23.400
I like that.

45:23.400 --> 45:24.400
Yeah.

45:24.400 --> 45:25.400
Alright.

45:25.400 --> 45:28.560
I'm going to go ahead and do another story here about Midway and some of the games that

45:28.560 --> 45:30.640
they have coming up here.

45:30.640 --> 45:33.900
They, you remember they were partnering up with MTV Games?

45:33.900 --> 45:35.840
Well, they really haven't said anything new on this,

45:35.840 --> 45:37.180
just the LA Rush partnership,

45:37.180 --> 45:38.620
but they are saying that a second game

45:38.620 --> 45:41.260
will hit in early 2006.

45:41.260 --> 45:42.400
Also, what I thought was interesting

45:42.400 --> 45:43.860
is they are actually creating a game

45:43.860 --> 45:45.700
based on the show from Adult Swim,

45:45.700 --> 45:47.080
Aqua Teen Hunger Force.

45:47.080 --> 45:47.920
Oh, God.

45:47.920 --> 45:49.740
And that will be coming out in early 2006 as well.

45:49.740 --> 45:51.160
That's gonna be nuts.

45:51.160 --> 45:53.880
Mortal Kombat will be coming out on the PSP,

45:53.880 --> 45:56.840
called Mortal Kombat Deception Unchained.

45:56.840 --> 46:00.000
It's supposed to ship in the first half of 2006.

46:00.000 --> 46:04.800
It'll have some new characters and content, including some of what was seen on the GameCube

46:04.800 --> 46:10.000
version of Deception, like Goro, Shao Kahn actually being playable characters.

46:10.000 --> 46:14.000
Also Wi-Fi support, more information to come soon.

46:14.000 --> 46:21.840
And also Spy Hunter, they are working on something but they won't say a whole lot.

46:21.840 --> 46:27.320
Oh, I guess I should also say this one, Unreal Tournament 2007.

46:27.320 --> 46:34.260
early look given at E3, but the next entry in the shooter franchise, they are working

46:34.260 --> 46:39.000
very hard to make it a game with as long as its shelf life as its predecessors.

46:39.000 --> 46:42.040
Not a whole lot of information on Unreal Tournament outside of that.

46:42.040 --> 46:45.620
I still need a couple of quests on PSP.

46:45.620 --> 46:46.620
Still waiting.

46:46.620 --> 46:48.780
Loki, you've got a homebrew story?

46:48.780 --> 46:49.840
Just real fun stuff.

46:49.840 --> 46:52.520
Someone made this cool little Mario game.

46:52.520 --> 46:57.200
It's basically combining the elements of the Super Nintendo version and some of the

46:57.200 --> 47:04.400
3d ones it's called Mario was it Mario world blue Twilight DX you can find it

47:04.400 --> 47:10.440
at www.mario ween as in Halloween dot TK because it's actually Halloween themed

47:10.440 --> 47:15.380
they've actually got boss battles looks interesting go try it out it's free have

47:15.380 --> 47:18.920
fun just a matter of time before that poor guy gets a cease and desist by the

47:18.920 --> 47:26.360
way yeah and we'll have that follow up in a future podcast PlayStation 3 as you

47:26.360 --> 47:30.500
guys may or may not know they're gonna go blu-ray. What's interesting is that

47:30.500 --> 47:35.180
they are really kind of enforcing that it's not gonna be easy to copy. I mean of

47:35.180 --> 47:41.560
course not only you know blu-ray piracy is gonna be years off as it is but they

47:41.560 --> 47:44.940
Sony is working with a blu-ray disc association to prepare the most

47:44.940 --> 47:49.700
comprehensive content management system ever employed on an optical disc format.

47:49.700 --> 47:54.260
Hmm supposedly it's gonna happen through a system called blu-rays advanced access

47:54.260 --> 47:59.700
content system and also a ROM mark and this is made to guard against mass

47:59.700 --> 48:03.500
production piracy or duplication and unauthorized copies.

48:03.500 --> 48:06.500
Hmm, Loki, what do you think? Will it work?

48:06.500 --> 48:11.140
Yeah, you know, I remember another story saying that the UMDs would never be

48:11.140 --> 48:14.900
cracked and could not be copied because it could not be read by a PC.

48:14.900 --> 48:19.180
Oh, oh, no, wait, they're wrong there. Let me put it this way, if it can be read by

48:19.180 --> 48:20.860
something it could be copied.

48:20.860 --> 48:25.340
that's bottom line it will be done no matter what the hell they do they could

48:25.340 --> 48:29.980
it will not work and basically this is really just gonna prevent people and

48:29.980 --> 48:30.660
tell

48:30.660 --> 48:34.260
you can copy a full blu-ray just like you can copy a DVD

48:34.260 --> 48:38.120
brand yeah it's gonna be harder but anything about the giga desk but you

48:38.120 --> 48:39.940
know you can actually buy GD roms

48:39.940 --> 48:43.580
well that's that

48:43.580 --> 48:48.760
and lastly tonight GamePro magazine teamed up with mad magazine to present

48:48.760 --> 48:52.960
the 10 worst things about video games you can check out

48:52.960 --> 48:57.000
a preview the 10 actually I'm sorry the article is about the 50 worst things

48:57.000 --> 49:01.040
the article online is the 10 and you can check it out over on GamePro.com they

49:01.040 --> 49:01.600
have this

49:01.600 --> 49:05.800
just a couple of these points see if you guys here in studio agree with them

49:05.800 --> 49:09.480
one game designers who cannot understand

49:09.480 --> 49:12.920
why more women don't play video games especially since they feature such

49:12.920 --> 49:16.680
outstanding female role models as a globe-trotting archaeologist with big

49:16.680 --> 49:17.120
boobs

49:17.120 --> 49:21.840
World-class volleyball champions with big boobs and of course easily murdered hookers with big boobs

49:21.840 --> 49:25.280
And then of course they have the picture as drawn by mad magazine to go with that

49:26.320 --> 49:28.080
ho-ho and ho

49:28.080 --> 49:33.560
Console manufacturers selling systems without basic essentials like memory cards or a second controller

49:33.560 --> 49:36.960
So you have to shell out another 60 bucks before you can?

49:37.480 --> 49:43.840
Play as the article says see so much a hair as see so much as a hair on Luigi's mustache

49:43.840 --> 49:48.840
but yeah that kind of bothers me too they say oh the console is coming out

49:48.840 --> 49:53.120
it's only gonna be $300 I love that by the way you have to buy a memory card in

49:53.120 --> 50:00.020
a console so this stuff lastly oh this will this will make Jamie upset so I

50:00.020 --> 50:04.120
have to read this one Sega's long pathetic parade of short-lived console

50:04.120 --> 50:09.400
systems from the Sega CD to the 32x to the Saturn to the Dreamcast establishing

50:09.400 --> 50:15.280
a legacy of failure on its way to rivaling that of the Chicago Cubs.

50:15.280 --> 50:20.640
You know, the systems only failed because people didn't appreciate them, and you know,

50:20.640 --> 50:24.360
and Sega, I have to say, had really stupid marketing.

50:24.360 --> 50:29.240
They had good systems, good solid systems, but they weren't given the support that they

50:29.240 --> 50:30.520
needed.

50:30.520 --> 50:36.120
You know, the Saturn, the Saturn in Japan, brilliant system.

50:36.120 --> 50:43.120
I mean, just has so many great games, would regularly hold it's own neck and neck with the, with the Playstation.

50:43.120 --> 50:45.640
But over here, did we get a lot of the cool crap?

50:45.820 --> 50:46.320
No.

50:46.320 --> 50:49.440
The last good game we got was Burning Rangers.

50:49.440 --> 50:53.040
And it was actually, if I'm correct, the last game that was on the Saturn over here.

50:53.920 --> 50:57.120
Which I luckily enough have, now have a US copy of.

50:57.120 --> 50:58.520
Still love Mad Magazine.

50:58.520 --> 50:59.640
Thanks to Classic Gaming Expo.

50:59.640 --> 51:01.560
Still love Mad Magazine after that little tidbit.

51:01.560 --> 51:11.760

51:56.720 --> 52:03.280
do it. We could do it if we really wanted to. We'll see. Anyway, final thoughts, Loki.

52:03.280 --> 52:07.640
Burnout 3 is awesome, but you know they can really get rid of the announcer or have it

52:07.640 --> 52:11.960
so you can bypass the training videos that take up five minutes of my time. My final

52:11.960 --> 52:18.240
thought is, shake a body, shake a body, shake a body, down to the ground. DarkSakura, your

52:18.240 --> 52:22.680
final thought. I normally say I reject false icons at this point, but I'm just going to

52:22.680 --> 52:25.920
to say that I'm looking forward to the day that Jack Thompson is laughed out of

52:25.920 --> 52:33.080
court you stupid fucker and on that note have a great day that's the end of

52:33.080 --> 52:38.280
