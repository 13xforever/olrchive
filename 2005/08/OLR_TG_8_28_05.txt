Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of August 29th, 2005.
You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.
Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
Hello, everybody out there who's subscribed to our podcast.
Welcome to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition.
You're home for chat about video games that don't suck, and sometimes we do have to talk about those games that do suck, but only to tell you to avoid them.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Hurricane Katrina is expected to land, so definitely our thoughts are with you guys, and we really hope for the best for you guys.
Joining us tonight as well, though, is the one and only Loki.
Yes, I'm here.
How you doing?
I'm awake.
Yes, I think.
Busy week?
No, but this week will be.
What do you got going on this next week?
I've got 19 game publishers coming to my work this week.
19 game publishers.
Now, for those folks that don't know what Loki does, he does freely talk about his work on here, and you even have co-workers that listen to this show, huh?
Yeah.
And they don't care that you talk about this stuff?
No.
Oh, cool.
Well, then tell them what you do.
I work for a video distribution company called VPD, second largest in the United States, and I'm one of the game sales reps there.
So, you know, basically we've got these...
Gameholders are coming in to check out what the company is about because they're not familiar with VPD.
They just know the old company that we bought out, which was VBC, Video Bicycling.
So they're going to come check out the place.
On Tuesday, they're having a party for them.
They're going to be bringing in foosball tables, pool tables.
Typical schmooze up to the corporate folks.
Barbecue, that kind of stuff.
ActaVision
It's going to be the next Grand Theft Auto, basically, but in the Old West.
What's Gun?
I have not heard of this.
Gun is pretty much an open kind of action game, very similar to Grand Theft Auto, where you can do whatever you want, pretty much, and they have a main story that goes along with that, but it's set in the Wild West.
So you can go mine gold, you can go scalp people, you can just do all that sort of stuff.
So it's like Deadwood, that show on HBO?
It's like Red Dead Revolver.
It's set in the Wild West, but they all say, you know...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
They're all, yeah, we read it on that site, Advent Children.
Yeah, because I, or AdventChildren.net.
Yeah, because I posted it on there, you dumbass.
No, everybody still doesn't believe that's coming out that day.
I'm hearing, I can't remember who the hell I heard this from.
I want to say it might have even been you, but about why Advent Children's being delayed.
The rumor?
Okay, rumor of a rumor, guys.
Take this with a grain of salt.
It's one of those, like,
and so on.
Take it with a grain of salt, guys, but just imagine the possibilities.
And if that's true, that it is, I mean, if we're talking limited IMAX engagement, we're talking very similar to what's going on in Tokyo, or not Tokyo, Japan, in cities like Tokyo, where they are going to be showing it in only like three or four cities for like a week.
That would probably be what happens here.
But take it with a grain of salt, guys.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Well, either way, it's coming out on November 29th, which is, you know, Tuesday, right before the holiday, you know.
I don't know, I wish it were coming out sooner, but that's the way they told me.
I'm like, oh no, why?
Most of the big gaming sites are agreeing with you now, so I was reading them this week.
Well, yeah, I mean, it's been pushed back a few times, so everyone's like, well, the Square Enix site's still saying it's coming out September.
Yeah, well, that's because they have nothing to do with the date that it comes out in, so whatever.
But, yeah, so that's what's going on.
All right, all right.
So, well, let's start off tonight's show by talking about, even though we've kind of already been talking about some games, we typically try to get this out in the beginning.
What games have we been playing this week?
So, Loki, what have you been up to this week?
Well, I've been playing a couple things.
Burnout 3, still, of course.
I'm almost done with it because we decided to cheat and unlock everything.
So, because we got, you know, we got tired of playing the same track over and over.
We're still playing it, though, because we now have really fast cars and
It's still even more fun to race, but I was also playing a little bit of Pack Picks.
I tried that.
How was that?
I saw that you picked that up.
How was that game?
It was one of those random buys I did, and it's okay.
I'm just not really kind of feeling the game.
It's just kind of like, eh.
It was one of those things where I played the tech demo at E3 a year and a half ago when the DS was first being shown.
and I then I heard that they were making it into a game and I was kind of like you're gonna take this concept and make it an actual game I mean I can see this being a minigame but from what I understand it came out okay like the best that that concept possibly could but it's it's it's okay but it's just like kind of it's it's like one of those things like oh but maybe it should be a minigame to something or maybe it should be like I don't know uh
It's okay.
I mean, it's probably not worth $30.
I paid for it, but it's still okay.
Wait for the bargain bin.
Definitely.
For a lot of the DS games, wait for the bargain bin.
$35 is a lot.
Well, I don't know.
I disagree with you.
I think Meteos is definitely worth the price.
Nintendogs, which I'm sure you're about to get to in a minute, is depending on if it's your kind of game, because you already know if you'd like Nintendogs or not, honestly.
You already know.
We don't have to tell you if it's a good or bad game.
You would know...
If you like these virtual pet kind of games.
So, sorry to steal your thunder, but I'm sure you've been playing a lot of Nintendogs as well.
I've been playing a little bit of Nintendogs.
A little bit?
Yeah, I bought all three.
Why did you buy all three when you can unlock all the dogs in one cartridge if you just network well enough?
I don't know.
I didn't know that, so I just bought all three.
Sucker.
You know, whatever.
It's okay.
All right.
Anything else you've been playing this week?
Burnout?
Nintendogs?
What did you think of Nintendogs?
Was it everything you'd hoped for?
Yeah, but the thing's kind of needy.
I don't have enough time to play this game and other games at the same time, so that's kind of tough.
yet you would log into Final Fantasy XI for hours on end.
That wasn't a problem.
I played a little bit of Final Fantasy XI this week.
I logged in for a couple hours because I hadn't played for two months.
I felt obligated.
That's it.
That's all the games you've been playing?
That's all I've been playing.
Next week should be better.
Oh, I played Marvel Nemesis Rise of the Imperfects.
That was the other one.
It's an awesome fighting game that they're going to be coming out with in September here.
It's just
I don't know, it was really neat.
They've got all the characters, plus they have these ones that EA actually made up.
So that was kind of neat.
Games I've been playing this week.
Nintendogs, of course.
I ran out and picked that one up.
I picked up the one that had the Shih Tzu in it, because as I promised everybody out there, I was going to get a Shih Tzu.
And I did have a Shih Tzu for a little while, but unfortunately, because...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and um did it translate well into a full game the five minute demo that they had at E3?
I think in most ways yes it did certainly in the very Nintendo way the cuteness factor the collectability aspect of it that's very you know Pokemon-ish and Animal Crossing-ish and other Nintendo games that they're famous for I think it really does deliver on all that and I really think it's a
A neat way to transform the Tamagotchi and Pokemon concept into something that will be very accessible to a lot of people.
I think it is going to be a very successful game.
My only beef with it is that the actual game elements of it, outside of training your dog, turned out to be kind of thin.
Granted, you have these trial competitions that you can do, the agility trial, where you teach your dog how to jump over hurdles and run through tubes and stuff.
There's the obedience competition, which is kind of boring, you just yell voice commands at your dog.
And a frisbee competition, I don't remember the exact name of it, but there's a frisbee competition as well.
Sort of wears a little bit thin, especially the fact that you have to sit through these two announcers who talk very slowly and have really lame jokes and stuff.
I was also a little bit disappointed that you couldn't do more with the head-to-head aspect.
Like, you couldn't go head-to-head in an agility trial.
At least, if you can, I haven't found this out yet or anything.
So, I was a little disappointed that all you can really do is exchange and play with each other's dogs.
Although that is a really neat concept, I would have liked to have seen something maybe a little more competitive.
You can, like, I guess because each game has certain items that are in each one.
Right.
So in order to get all the items, you have to have all the games.
Trade.
So I guess maybe it's more of a friendly competition.
It's a co-op game instead of a competitive game.
I would have liked to have seen maybe more ways that you could have pitted dogs up against each other to see who the better trainer is.
But I still think it's a very solid game.
I think it's a very...
A holiday edition has been trademarked.
Don't know if that's going to be something that actually happens, but who knows.
And I want to talk about DS expansions in one of our stories tonight, because it's very interesting the way they're expanding some of the DS games.
Other than Nintendogs, I really didn't play a whole lot of new stuff, just Final Fantasy XI.
I apologize, Loki, I didn't get to the copy of Hello Kitty Roller Rescue that you gave me last week.
I haven't had a chance to hook up the GameCube, so I'm trying to look for a better cable for it.
I need to get at least an S video for my high-def TV.
Okay.
and Halo 2.
Last night I went over to a friend's birthday party and it was just a bunch of guys playing Halo 2.
And somehow we got the idea that we'd get our friend who doesn't really play a lot of video games but really likes to talk shit.
We'd get him really drunk and he just got online and my friend who's really good at Halo, you know he's like a level 20 something and all the head to head stuff.
We got him to actually control and my friend to wear the headset.
So he just made fun of people the whole night.
Like, made fun of people's names.
He was making fun of people on the same team and stuff.
Highly immature stuff.
Highly, highly amusing.
It was so funny because there was this girl who ended up getting more kills than my friend in one match.
Either it was a girl or a little boy who hadn't gone through puberty yet.
Because the boys are really kind of like this.
And the person was going...
and just doing this dance in their living room or something and yelling at us on Xbox Live.
The joys of Xbox Live and talking smack.
Not so much fun if you're on the receiving end, though, I bet.
Anyway, let's get to that story about the expansion pack, actually.
I'll start off with this story tonight.
This is actually a game we've talked a little bit about on the show, but I don't know of a U.S.
release of this game yet.
It's actually a Japanese game called Jam with the Band.
Uh-huh.
And it's kind of one of those ones where you play the instruments on your DS and interactive title.
This hasn't come out in the US yet, but what is coming out in Japan, apparently the game has been very successful in Japan.
So they're going to be releasing an expansion pack.
But you have to have the DS game to be able to use the expansion pack.
The way the expansion pack works, it's a Game Boy Advance cartridge that plugs into the bottom slot of your DS.
And so 20 songs are loaded into the DS cartridge.
Songs that I don't recognize a whole lot of these songs.
A lot of them are Japanese titles, except for one of them.
And that's the Numa Numae song is on here, the, you know...
Dragostun, Tay, or whatever it's called.
That's in the expansion pack for Jam of the Band, along with some Nintendo favorites.
Star Fox 64, Super Mario 64 DS are all in this expansion pack.
But I think that's very... What's neat about this story, not so much the game, but the method of delivering the expansion.
It's cool that you mentioned that.
There's another game that's coming out similar to that.
Metroid Prime Pinball.
and DarkSakura.
I knew there was more to that advanced slot than just Game Boy Advance games.
If you think about it, this goes all the way back to Field of Magic XXY or whatever it is.
One of the launch titles where Secret Trick, if you put in I think it's Sonic Adventure 2 in your GBA slot, you unlock a Sonic costume on the DS cartridge.
So we've known forever the DS has this capability to interact with whatever game is in the bottom slot.
So if a Nintendogs
So hypothetically, if there is this holiday edition and an expansion pack is delivered, I'd bet you either it's going to be its own standalone cartridge where they try to get you to buy the same game over again because you can get cute Santa hats for your puppy, or it's going to be an expansion pack, which I think would be very cool.
Imagine that, an expansion pack that plugs in the advance that would work with all three titles and maybe unlock a particular breed of dog in no matter what game you own.
That would be cool.
We'll see, though.
We'll see.
Also in the news tonight, I was talking about Halo a little bit ago.
Of course, you guys probably heard that Halo is going to be turned into a movie projected to be about 2007 for this movie to come out.
Fox and Universal were the ones that teamed up to create this movie.
The script, as I understand, is being written by the guy who did 28 Days Later, Alex Garland.
But at the same time, he also did The Beach.
So...
Could be hit or miss.
So we'll see.
More news.
No stars attached yet, but I'm sure all of that will develop a little bit later on.
Also, I want to say about Halo.
This, I think, is very interesting.
There's going to be a Halo triple pack coming out before the end of the year.
Yeah, it's coming out in October.
It's going to be $60, or as they say, $59.99, but I say that's just $60.
It's going to be Halo, Halo 2, and the Halo 2 multiplayer map pack.
Now, usually if you bought these games together, it would cost you about $80.
So it's kind of like you're getting a combo, burgers, fries, and soda, right?
But my question is...
Who that owns an Xbox, who is this aimed at?
Because if you own an Xbox, you have to own one of these games unless you're not a first person shooter type.
But if that's the case, I don't know why you own an Xbox.
No, all kidding aside though, there's sports titles, Ninja Gaiden, there's other Xbox titles that are good.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
at least the Halos will be backwards compatible.
This is going to be a good way to get people, you know, to catch up on Halo who might be joining Microsoft with the Xbox 360 and didn't have an Xbox.
But my thought along with that is, who's going to buy an Xbox 360 that isn't already an Xbox fan?
Exactly.
I don't know how many people.
You don't own an Xbox, right?
No.
Are you going to buy an Xbox 360?
Probably just because it's a next-gen system.
Okay, then you're the only person I've talked to that would plan to be buying an Xbox 360.
I guess there could be other folks out there, but I just...
Really, I'm not buying it for Halo.
If Halo comes out for it, I'm not going to buy it.
Are you buying it for Final Fantasy XI Pretty Edition?
No, hell no.
I'm not buying it for that.
I'm buying it for Project Gotham Racing 3.
That's what I'm buying it for.
That and Ridge Racer 6.
Hell yeah.
It's all about the racing games.
Okay, well then I guess I stand corrected because feasibly, with this lower price, they could taunt someone like you into buying this, although you're not a Halo fan.
I would not buy the stupid Halo expansion pack and that crap.
But you're not a Halo fan, either.
If you think about it, though, Halo 2 is probably going to drop in price here pretty quick anyways to about $20, and then it'll be just $60 anyways.
Oh, I disagree.
Halo, they're still asking $29.99 for Halo 1.
No, it's not.
It's dropped down to $20.
I saw it somewhere for $29.99.
Ah, no.
But whatever.
Mine came with my Xbox.
I have a pretty green Xbox, so I didn't have to worry about it.
Mine came with mine.
Except I thought Halo was part of that, you know...
The Best Hits or whatever they call them, Platinum.
It is and it isn't.
You know, it's the best selling Xbox game of all time, but they can still get away with charging $30 for it.
Yeah, you know, see everything in this collection of ours is supposed to be $17.99, but we just want some more money for it.
XBOX 360
has created a pack and they're calling this the ultimate Xbox 360 pack.
It comes with a system, Perfect Dark Zero, Project Gotham Racing 3, Elder Scrolls 4, Dead or Alive 4, Call of Duty 2, Gun, Quake 4, Tony Hawk, Condemned, Madden NFL 06, Cameo, Wireless Controller, Play and Charge Kit, Rechargeable Battery, 12-Month Card,
for Xbox Live one-year product replacement plan.
And it'll only set you back $1,199.83.
Yes, boys and girls, that was $1,199.
Not even... So go lie down your $5 now and reserve that.
This is retarded.
$50.
Oh, is it $50?
That's right, it's $50 for a system, huh?
Retarded.
Who would buy that crap?
Rich people?
I mean, seriously, though, you probably could go shop it and get it for a lot cheaper anyways.
Well, I don't know.
Maybe.
Maybe.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
DualSystems
Our email address, togo, T-O-G-O, at orangeloungeradio.com We'd like to hear from you.
It helps inflate our egos a little bit to know that there's folks out there listening.
Sure.
No, we'd like to hear from you guys and comment on the show and stuff.
Unfortunately, because Dark Sakura is out tonight and she's kind of the queen of our mailbox, I only have one letter tonight because it was something that was actually sent directly to me.
Somebody actually sent me an email directly.
But that's cool.
At least it gives me something to read tonight.
Okay.
And I thought it was a good email, so we're going to read this.
This comes to us from Flynn.
Flynn says, hello, I've just heard my first podcast of your show, courtesy of my PSP.
So I think it's very interesting that he's downloading the show on the PSP, because if you're a PSP owner, we're going to do something for you guys.
But we're not talking about it just yet.
We're working on it.
Hopefully within the month.
Oh, yeah, by the way, I forgot to mention this earlier this week.
I bought another PSP.
So I have two PSPs now.
Sucker.
All right, anyway.
So hello to those of you listening on your PSPs.
We're going to do something for you guys pretty soon.
Flynn wanted to comment on what a listener named Rob had to say about virtual ethics in regards to the Chinese exchange student using a bot to mug other players in Lineage 2 and sell their virtual loot for real cash.
Rob went on to say that virtual ethics or ethics in not a real place are inconsequential.
I can't talk tonight.
Too many syllables in that word.
I'm thinking about that Xbox DS and I'm seeing dollar signs all over.
Anyway, Flynn says, there's a famous saying, ethics is what you do in the dark when no one's watching.
I can think of no darker a place than cyberspace where no one can watch.
Would you empty the contents of a lost wallet if no one knew you had it?
Or would you track down the owner to return the wallet knowing no reward would be given and they would never find you if you did not?
Having never played Lineage 2, I can only assume that mugging and player killing are part of the many wonderful experiences you can participate in during the game, and that the student had not hacked the program in order to create these things.
I actually tried to do a little research.
Well, let me finish this letter.
I have also heard of people creating things in the virtual world to auction off for real cash, and as far as I know, this is not illegal.
That being said, mugging and PKing and selling virtual loot in the real world should not have led to an arrest, in my opinion.
The only crime was maybe the creation of the bot program.
However, everyone should be crystal clear in that his actions were unethical.
Do not believe for one second that you are a good, upstanding citizen in the real world while treating people like garbage in the virtual world.
Very good point.
doing awful things while hiding behind a screen name or handle is just revealing your true nature in the dark that comes to us from Flynn
Thank you for the email, Flynn.
I actually tried to do a little research as to whether Lineage 2 has that mugging feature built in.
So I went to Google, you know, like Lineage 2 mugging, and of course I just got a bunch of articles.
But I tried reading some, doing a little research, trying to see if mugging is something that's built into the game.
It's my understanding that although it sounds like PK is something that's built into the game, what this person did is the person wrote a bot program to automate
Doing all of these quests.
And doing things faster than a human can possibly do them.
So the bot would always win.
No matter what, the bot would win.
And the bot was basically unkillable.
So, in a way, he kind of, I guess, brought an exploit to light?
I don't know what you'd call it.
But I definitely agree with Flynn that it was unethical.
But Flynn says maybe they went a little far in arresting the guy.
So, your thoughts are welcome to go at OrangeLoungeRadio.com I don't know about unethical.
I mean, because...
One could say if you create a better way of doing something that's unethical, but I call it, you know, innovative.
Okay, you know what, though?
You know what, though?
There's a difference.
You're talking about cheating in Burnout 3 in single-player mode, right?
What you were doing earlier this week?
I downloaded a save.
That's different, because you're only affecting your game.
If you want to go on to Moviespoilers.com or whatever that site is, and you want to read the end to every movie that's out there, go for it.
Have fun.
Spoil the movies for yourselves.
Have a blast.
But if you go and tell all your friends about the spoilers, somebody's going to get pissed off at you about it.
I think it's kind of similar.
You can ruin the game for yourself if you want, but ruining the game for others is crossing the line.
That's kind of the way I look at it.
Yeah.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Apparently these guys were hooking up the Xbox to their computer somehow so that they would always be the server.
And if they're the server, they can cause the other players to lag out and basically kill them while they can't move.
And I was watching this happening.
Sure enough, every couple minutes, lag, lag, lag, my friends are dead.
Lag, lag, lag, my friends are dead.
And everybody was bitching and complaining about this.
So somebody was doing this and the person had way many kills.
So, you know, I mean...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Seriously, I realize we do an internet radio show where we talk about video games, but we try to talk about balance between that and having a personal life.
So please kids, stop cheating on Halo 2 to make your internet penis feel bigger.
Go out and get laid, because I'll tell you what, an orgasm feels 10,000 times better than owning some noob in Halo 2, at least in my opinion.
Maybe you feel differently, I don't know.
Follow-up to a previous story we talked about.
You know how we said that the firmware was going to be upgraded on the Sony PSP like two weeks ago?
Well, they were a little bit late.
Finally came out.
It was finally released.
It came out this past week, and now it's available on Sony's site.
So if you are interested in upgrading your firmware to 2.0, you can go ahead and do that.
What you're going to get?
New web browser application.
And it also has a tabbing feature.
You can have three tabs of browser windows open at once, which is kind of neat.
Other additions include 4-3 ratio, so you can watch TV programs, 4-3 screen mode.
AAC and WAV audio files are also added.
Check out the PlayStation site if you want more details.
I got to check out, because I checked out on Loki's new PSP, he upgraded it to 2.0, I checked out the web browser, and of course I'm loading OrangeLaunchRadio.com on the web browser, looking at it, and ooh, pretty.
Neat, I guess, neat.
It's a lot faster than the Wipeout browser, I'll give them that.
That's for sure, it's a lot faster than that.
And browsing's pretty easy, I don't like the stupid little text input that they have, but they're releasing keyboard for it, so...
Well, it's like a cell phone where you have to keep tapping one button.
They're going to be releasing a keyboard, so whatever.
But they actually did improve their method of entering stuff in because you can see how many times you've got to tab the button to get to your next letter.
But it's not that hard.
I mean, it's not going to be good for chatting or anything.
But even some of the IRC programs that they've made for it, like the one website, PSP IRC or something like that, they have a Java keyboard anyway, so you don't really need it.
Hmm.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
for their PSP launch.
It's called YourPSP.com.
And they're going to have movie trailers, downloadable games, and stuff like that.
And so I'll be interested when that happens.
And you could, essentially, if they're going to implement Flash, then you would be able to download Strong Bad.
Right?
You could listen to that on your PSP, right?
Yeah, I guess you could.
So, dude, we really need Strong Bad to burninate your PSP.
Well, you know, a lot of the kids out there would like that.
I don't know.
I like Strong Bad, he's funny.
Moving on, what do you got for us tonight, Loki?
Well, we got a couple things, a couple things in the rumor mills.
First off, starting that, IGN did this nice little look at the Game Boy Micro, which is coming out in September here in a couple weeks.
They did a bunch of size comparisons, and I can say that it's about the size of a stick of gum.
Because they have a winter fresh gum thing next to it.
It looks more like the size of the guy's cell phone in the picture you have there.
It's just a small Game Boy Advance.
I mean, if you really want to buy it again, go for it.
But, I don't know.
I don't see the point of buying this thing.
Some people out there might like the accessory-ness of this.
I don't know.
Well, the people that buy this thing and like the fact that you can change the face plates are the people that buy the stupid Game Boy Advances when they come out in different colors.
Do we really?
I mean, no.
No, I'm not buying that.
Anyways.
Um, the other thing was, is they had some info on, um, what they think is going to be revolutionary about the, um, Nintendo Revolution.
Now, granted, we're going to know in a few weeks what is revolutionary about it, because on the 16th, Nintendo's actually holding a press conference.
They're going to let all the cats out of the bag.
About time.
So, everything's going to be known about the Revolution.
But, in the meantime, we could speculate to, you know, the cows.
Alright, speculate away.
So, this speculation is supposedly by this guy, um,
Sponge, or whatever he claims to know what's going on.
And basically, he's said that there's going to be, it's going to make it so where that it's hard to turn the controller, like tilt the controller.
It's going to have gyroscopes in it, so it's going to be kind of like, almost like a rumble pack, but it's going to make it so that it feels like, for example, you're drifting around a corner, it'll give you G-forces, you know, going one direction or something.
I don't know how that's going to work, but that's an interesting idea, because it'll be
Revolutionary in the fact that this hasn't been done, and the fact that gyroscopes spin revolutionary.
Ah, cute, cute.
That's a theory, but I don't know.
My personal thing is I think it's going to be that, and I think if you've seen those keyboards out there that have the little LCD buttons on them, where they can change what the button looks like, I think that's going to be the other thing.
I think it's two things.
I don't know.
I'm totally speculating too.
But we'll know in a couple weeks on the 16th.
All the speculation comes back to the controller, which I think is interesting.
Yeah, and they said that that would be revolutionary, I'd imagine, but I don't know if it's revolutionary enough to sell the system.
You know what though, you're also assuming though, when you're saying that it's a play on the name, that the actual name of the system is going to be the revolution.
This is still a working title, correct?
Yeah.
They have not confirmed that this will be the actual name of the system.
And for the longest time, GameCube was what, Dolphin, I think they were calling it?
Yeah.
Or was that the 64?
I don't know, one or the other.
One of them, yeah.
Yeah.
And they changed the name before it was released.
So this may not actually be the Nintendo Revolution.
We may get a new name coming up.
Yeah, just like the Xbox 360.
What the hell was that?
I mean, 360?
That's retarded.
Xbox 2.
Xbox 360.
Why is it the 360?
Because we're going back around and doing the same thing all over again?
I don't know.
So anyways, there's that.
And speaking of the 360, and I mentioned this a couple weeks ago about the Origin 360 site.
Well, it's changing.
The site is changing, and there's more stuff happening.
Before, for those who might not remember, the Origin site had a picture of a tree with a countdown to sometime in September, and there was a bunny rabbit.
Okay.
Okay.
BunnyRabbits moved to the other side of the screen, the hole's getting bigger in the bottom of the tree, and there's apples growing.
And one of the apples is a symbol for the Windows Messenger, which is interesting.
So, integration with Windows Messaging for Xbox 360, maybe?
I mean, come on, this is a Microsoft product, of course they're going to have that.
Don't jump to conclusions.
It's just another viral site.
If you really want to check it out, originxbox360.com That's O-R-I-G-E-N xbox360.com Go look at the pretty bunny.
I guess something's going to happen with the bunny.
The controller will be a bunny.
I think the bunny should be a mascot.
We need a good bunny mascot.
It's a cardboard bunny.
It doesn't do anything.
I think it would have been funny, though, if you keep going back to the site, there's more bunnies up here or something like that.
That would be great.
No, really, other than that, well, I've got more hack and crack stuff, but we'll get into that later.
A little later?
Alright.
We'll do some more stories over here.
Tamagotchi's coming out for the DS, which shouldn't be much of a surprise when you consider that the Nintendogs was kind of a
Tamagotchi Corner Shop
You help Memichi or Kupachi set up a shop and the ultimate goal is to become Princess Tamako's favorite one.
Whatever.
Huh?
Yeah, whatever.
That's exactly what I said about this.
You can do a beauty salon or a flower shop and you do mini games with a DS stylus.
Huh?
Yeah, anyway.
So it's Harvest Moon, but with convenience stores.
With characters that were pop culture ten years ago.
You know.
What?
Speaking of Tomodachi, Neopets Darkest Fairy comes out next month.
Woo!
The fairy!
Nintendo is buying back 2.2 million shares.
The possible reason for this?
Square Enix trying to take over Taito.
Nintendo does not want
is kind of different and cute and does their own thing.
I think there's a partnership to be had here between Apple and Nintendo.
I don't know.
I was just randomly thinking that the other day.
You know, I think... What?
What the hell?
There's like a sticker on here.
On your DS?
Yeah, it came off.
Quit scratching over the stylus.
Anyways, I was thinking, just when you mentioned Apple and Nintendo, I was just thinking, the Apples are like the Volkswagen of the PC world.
That's what they reminded me of.
You can address those cards and letters to Loki at OrangeLongTrigger.com Look, they released cute stuff that's in different colors.
I mean, that's what Volkswagen does.
Cute cars suck.
Yeah, so by the way, in case you missed that underlying story within the story, Square Enix made a $600 million bid for Taito this week.
And what did we try to do?
We tried to figure out what would it sound like if we combined all three names?
Square, Enix, and Taito?
Squito.
Squito.
Squito.
I like Squito.
I like Squito, too.
So the company will hereforth be known as Squeedo.
Assuming this goes through, which I don't see why it won't at this point.
I mean, who cares?
So what?
I think it's a good thing.
Yeah, why not?
Metroid Prime.
You know how there was this big stink?
We even talked about this on the show a couple months ago where folks were saying that, oh, this game should have been online.
If you keep pushing this game back, it should have been online.
Why didn't you put this game online?
You keep pushing this back.
And Nintendo finally saying, Metroid Prime.
Going Online.
Prime Hunters.
Yes, Metroid Prime Hunters.
I'm sorry.
Metroid Prime Hunters will be going online.
It will be compatible with Nintendo's Wi-Fi service coming out later this year.
We just got pushback probably in November.
Everything else.
Can't Nintendo do any... Can't any game company do anything on time?
I wanted my Mario Kart, goddammit, for my birthday, and I had to wait until November.
That's not fair.
That Animal Crossing.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Speaking of the DS, Sony's flinging a little mud, calling the DS a gimmick this week.
Sony releasing some commentary this week.
Vice President of the Sony Studios, Phil Harrison, making the following comments.
The idea of a handheld rivalry with Nintendo is an irrelevance.
Those formats don't appear in our planning.
It's not a fair comparison.
Not fair on them, I should stress.
That sounds arrogant, maybe, but that's the truth.
We're just bitter that they're outselling us in Japan by a lot.
But here's the interesting quote here now.
But I fear that it won't have a lasting impact beyond that of a gimmick.
So the long-lasting appeal of the platform is at peril as a direct result of that.
Yeah, do you think that the DS is going to be the last handheld system?
No.
Here's another one.
Nintendo knows its target audience because it has really narrowed that down, and it's pretty much defined by a boy or girl's ability to admire Pokemon.
Ooh, burn!
Yeah, and what's the PSP had released for now?
Rehashes of crappy games that were out on the PlayStation.
You know what?
I like the PSP, and I don't want to take sides in the PSP versus DS war, because the PSP does have a lot of great features, especially in the fact that it's a multimedia system.
However, in games, PSP's lacking a little bit right now.
Realize there's good stuff on the horizon, like Grand Theft Auto, but as far as I'm concerned...
Don't start making these comments until you get the games to back it up, because Luminous is just one game.
Seriously, I have both, and you know what?
I'm looking at the lineup of games coming out for the PSP.
Ain't nothing impressive.
But earlier, I bet if we went back to archives of the show from February, you would hear me saying the same crap about the DS, right?
Before the PSP came out, where DS needs to put out some games.
DS has a ton of stuff coming out.
A ton of stuff just being released.
PSP, one or two a month.
With UMDs.
Galore.
Yeah, tons of movies.
Good for movies, but you know what?
It's a gaming system.
It's a gaming system, not an internet browser, not a movie player It's a gaming system
But when the PSP launches in Europe this week, which, by the way, PSP's launching in Europe this week, one of the games that's going to be released for it is going to let you have a custom soundtrack, and it's Touka Race Driver 2.
You can have a custom soundtrack option, and if you have music stored on your memory stick, you can use that as the music you listen to in-game.
It's pretty cool.
That's a cool idea.
Now, there you go.
Now, to use the feature, by the way, you have to download the free exact audio copy utility from Codemasters UK website.
That's Codemasters.co.uk So, check that out.
North American release not announced yet, but Codemasters does bring a lot of their Europe games over here.
Toka is one.
I'm sure it'll be here in a minute.
What else you got for us tonight, Loki?
Well, speaking of the PSP, lots of stuff when it comes to doing things on the PSP that you're not supposed to.
Number one would be they found a way, or I should say
It's going to be released next week.
They found a way to turn back the clock or to bring the PSP from version 1.52 or 1.51 back to 1.5.
So like a DD level, your PSP.
Basically, you can take your PSP and turn it back to 1.5.
Only if you haven't upgraded to 2.0 because stuff gets a little different when you get to 2.0.
P6
which looks amazing.
It's got actually...
They've done everything from being able to play videos.
It looks just like Windows, sort of.
You can play audio files and that type of stuff.
Homebrew.
Wait, so this is a... It's like a shell.
Okay, for PSP?
For PSP.
It's like a way, like it alters the way things look and feel in the shell.
Okay.
What's also cool about it, though, they've added a ton of other stuff.
Like, for example, they are using a camera phone, this like add-on for some Sony Ericsson camera phone.
to actually be able to have a webcam on it so you can actually take pictures with your PSP, which is very interesting, actually.
So that's going to be coming out, and I'm sure they're going to have a web browser and stuff.
Tons of work being done on it.
Website with more info for this?
PSPUpdates.com has an interview, actually, with a guy who goes by the name Fluff.
They were hosting some cool kind of...
Oh, the Atari 2600 in there?
Awesome!
Adventure time.
It's time to play some... Sword Quest, here I come.
You know what they need to do?
Stella with some, like, you know, ad hoc compatibility stuff.
How about Stella with some wireless multiplayer?
Say I can play two-player combat.
Yeah, combat, it's on.
That'd be awesome.
They need to make a new combat game.
Atari needs to remake combat.
We need to have a petition for them to remake combat.
Didn't they?
I thought it was one... Because you know how they remade Pong and, uh... I don't think they did combat.
I know they did Pong, I know they did Fogger...
All these Atari ones are being remade.
Warlords was one.
Didn't they do combat?
They might have done combat.
Well, whatever.
They should do it again.
Make it better.
Here's the thing.
The PSP needs more games that are actually over the internet.
They've got a couple so far.
It took the DS a year or so.
Give the PSP till E3 next year.
I don't know.
I mean, that was one of the things that they're pushing.
You can play people over the internet.
Not yet.
Not yet.
Yeah.
We'll see.
We'll see.
All right.
Is that it?
That's for now.
Yeah.
You know the only thing, though, about Stella, though, and Atari 2600 emulation, you know, in all honesty, even though I talk wonderful things about these games, Kaboom, of course, another one of my favorites, Pitfall 2, love it.
The emulation thrill usually only lasts about five minutes.
DarkSakura.com
at the Ragnarok Festival, which was held in July.
Gravity said that they will reveal Ragnarok 2 online at the Tokyo Game Show.
The show is taking place September 16th, so if you're a fan of Ragnarok online, stay tuned to September and the Tokyo Game Show because they're going to have more information about Ragnarok 2.
That's really all I've got to say about that.
There was nothing else in that story.
Tekken 5 is going to be re-released in the arcades as Tekken 5
Dark Resurrection, and it's going to have two new characters as well as some newly rendered backgrounds.
It's going to be shown at the Amusement Machine Show in Japan on September 1st and should make its way to arcades this winter.
FYI they're also going to be showing some other interesting Namco games at this show Druaga Online which I think is really weird like suddenly Druaga is really big with Namco again you might remember this old old old old old game in the arcades Tower of Druaga I think it is well they recently released a PS2 Druaga title and now they've got Druaga Online so I guess they and I didn't maybe it was one of those things that was big in Japan and I just missed it somehow but I don't know as far as I know that series was dormant for like 20 years but I could be wrong don't send hate mail
Soul Calibur 3 has a date for Japan, November 24th, which is a little bit sooner than I expected.
November 24th for Japan, get this, October 25th for America.
I thought that this was a game we wouldn't be getting until next year.
Apparently I fell asleep on this one.
Four new characters, according to Famitsu Magazine, that are also going to be in this game, Soul Calibur 3, Maxi, Song Mina, Zhang Hua, and Young Sung will also be in Soul Calibur 3.
and that's in addition to those previously announced characters.
And of course, make your own characters.
Soul Calibur 3 will also be having a battle arena mode where you can set certain conditions for the fight to be able to win the fight.
So, might make for some interesting...
I guess these are things that are built in Battle Arena.
I'm not sure.
Coin Collector, where you have to collect as many coins as you can by attacking the opponent, and the coins you get are based on the attacks that you land on the opponent.
Soul Calibur Party or something?
I don't know.
The Statue Dances is another mode where you fight against a large stone statue that's eight times the size of your character.
And it dances?
Yeah.
No, it attacks because you're fast, but the statue is very slow, but it's very powerful, so you have to be quick, I guess.
Everybody party!
Interesting.
They're doing interesting things with it.
I think it'll be kind of cool.
Nintendo, of course, with their release of Nintendogs, they have a new partnership between Dogs Trust for the American and European release of Nintendogs.
Just to kind of remind people that, you know, raising a puppy in real life is a lot more complicated than it is in Nintendogs.
You can't turn off a real puppy.
And I noticed this in the manual of the game, even.
There's this big disclaimer about, you know, if you want to get a real puppy, keep in mind they don't stay puppies forever.
Something to that effect.
So if you own Nintendogs, check it out.
It's in the front of the manual.
An interesting little disclaimer there.
Huh.
Dogs Trust, their marketing director, Adrian Bruder, saying, Dogs Trust is pleased to be associated with Nintendogs.
The philosophy behind the game has a lot in common with our own aims of ensuring that every dog is a happy and loved pet.
Despite the fame of our Dog is for Life slogan, thousands of dogs are still abandoned and unwanted every year.
So it's great that there's a game that's not only fun to play, but supports the message that responsible dog ownership means more than giving your dog an occasional stroke.
He could have used better word choice there, but whatever.
I only think of South Park right now.
Raid Rocket, Raid Rocket, Raid Rocket.
Any more stories for us, Loki?
No, I don't.
I was just reading.
There's some interesting thing they're talking about online poker sites and people botting on that and winning real money.
Ooh, it's just a matter of time before something like that happens.
Interesting.
I'm like, hmm.
Because when I was, that email I read today, when I was doing some of the research, I actually was reading comments on, I don't know, Slashdot or some other site, where people were saying, if somebody, it's just a matter of time before somebody does this in a game where it's real money at stake, as opposed to fake items worth real money in the online auction world.
Yeah, I guess it's on this game called Win Hold'em, and...
I guess it's just articles about the rise of internet botting and they're talking about on the internet nobody knows you're a bot and I guess last year the poker sites raked in 1.4 billion dollars and I mean just someone runs a bot and they can win tons of money.
It's kind of crazy.
Interesting.
Yeah.
Alright.
I guess we're on to our last story of the night.
and the last story of the night has to do with male nudity in a video game.
Oh god.
I'm sure DarkSakura should be very happy right now.
No, no, don't shut off your iPod just yet.
No, no, don't turn it off.
There's actually more to this story here.
It's actually a Midway game and it's their Blitz series.
So it's like a football series of games.
Yeah, Blitz the League because, you know...
They can't use NFL anymore.
Yeah, exactly.
So they don't do this.
So it's just Blitz the League.
Now, what's interesting is that supposedly, rumor is it's one of their viral marketers, the people that pose as regular fans that are infiltrating the message board.
Well, there was a post on the Midway message boards that's a screenshot from Blitz the League.
And it shows a cheerleader about ready to pull her shirt off.
So, you know, she's going to show her boobs, which is nothing new in a video game.
But what's also interesting about it is that there's a streaker...
and DarkSakura.com
We're gonna add drug use, and we're gonna, you know, add nudity, I guess.
So, it's a mature... Out of all the football games that come out, this is a mature-rated football game.
The rest are for everybody.
I'm interested because, you know, NFL Blitz was awesome, so this should be no different.
Props to Midway for thinking creative, I guess.
You know, those games like Madden and stuff, even though we don't talk a whole lot about sports games, because honestly, I just don't play them.
Madden was a disappointment.
From what I've heard from people that have been playing, they're like,
But previous sports titles, all these EA sports titles, they get more and more realistic and they start feeling like you're watching Monday Night Football.
Midway's taking that one step further with the realism aspect by adding the streakers.
Interesting.
Final thoughts, Loki, tonight?
I'll check out the game.
Midway's coming in next week, so I'll have some questions for them.
All right, sounds good.
My final thought is thank you guys very much for listening, and hey, send us an email.
Let us know how we're doing, togo, T-O-G-O, at orangeonstrade.com, or if you want to contact one of us directly, send Loki some hate mail.
or me some fan mail, you can always check that out on our website, www.orangeloungevideo.com.
And apologies to fans of our three-hour show that didn't get to hear us this Sunday because we had to cancel our live show this week.
We'll be back next week.
Got lots of music for you for next week.
Yes, we got a lot of Mimani remixes coming up on next week's show.
And I got to beg Tomo, which is the distributor of Age Tech, to make an RPG make for the PSP.
That's my goal next week.
Very cool.
And I received a bucket load of information on Percussion Master this week, so I'm going to be talking about that next week's show.
Okay.
All right.
Anyway, that's that.
Thanks for downloading our podcast and listening to us.
We appreciate your support.
Tell a friend about Orange Zones Radio to go, because honestly, when we have to compete against the bigger and bigger guys, ABC and all these other big podcasts that are out there, the only way that indie podcasts stay alive
I guess to get bigger at all and get the word out is for people to tell other people.
Yeah, we try getting Leo Laporte, but he just doesn't want to.
He's got his own podcast.
He said something about going back to G4 or something.
Poor guy.
Fight the fight from the inside.
On that note, good night everybody.
Have a good one.
That's the end of another Orange Lounge Radio To Go edition.
This podcast is a proud part of www.orangeloungeradio.com.
See you next update.
