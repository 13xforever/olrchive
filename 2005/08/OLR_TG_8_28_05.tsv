320	2801	Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of August 29th, 2005.
2901	14227	You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.
14487	18009	Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
19789	24152	Hello, everybody out there who's subscribed to our podcast.
24272	26833	Welcome to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition.
27623	35358	You're home for chat about video games that don't suck, and sometimes we do have to talk about those games that do suck, but only to tell you to avoid them.
35811	38273	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
62751	68175	Hurricane Katrina is expected to land, so definitely our thoughts are with you guys, and we really hope for the best for you guys.
69436	71637	Joining us tonight as well, though, is the one and only Loki.
72418	73078	Yes, I'm here.
73639	74159	How you doing?
75020	76020	I'm awake.
76421	77281	Yes, I think.
77922	79303	Busy week?
79663	81024	No, but this week will be.
81772	83072	What do you got going on this next week?
83092	86553	I've got 19 game publishers coming to my work this week.
86613	87213	19 game publishers.
87233	93794	Now, for those folks that don't know what Loki does, he does freely talk about his work on here, and you even have co-workers that listen to this show, huh?
93954	94154	Yeah.
94274	95634	And they don't care that you talk about this stuff?
95834	96034	No.
96355	96675	Oh, cool.
96695	97475	Well, then tell them what you do.
98695	107176	I work for a video distribution company called VPD, second largest in the United States, and I'm one of the game sales reps there.
107256	109897	So, you know, basically we've got these...
111223	116567	Gameholders are coming in to check out what the company is about because they're not familiar with VPD.
116607	121492	They just know the old company that we bought out, which was VBC, Video Bicycling.
121612	123353	So they're going to come check out the place.
123954	125915	On Tuesday, they're having a party for them.
126075	129518	They're going to be bringing in foosball tables, pool tables.
129538	131780	Typical schmooze up to the corporate folks.
131920	132921	Barbecue, that kind of stuff.
133291	133691	ActaVision
151732	154513	It's going to be the next Grand Theft Auto, basically, but in the Old West.
154533	155213	What's Gun?
155253	156353	I have not heard of this.
156373	167375	Gun is pretty much an open kind of action game, very similar to Grand Theft Auto, where you can do whatever you want, pretty much, and they have a main story that goes along with that, but it's set in the Wild West.
167775	173156	So you can go mine gold, you can go scalp people, you can just do all that sort of stuff.
173516	175537	So it's like Deadwood, that show on HBO?
176857	177997	It's like Red Dead Revolver.
178237	180838	It's set in the Wild West, but they all say, you know...
181345	182386	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
210851	213012	They're all, yeah, we read it on that site, Advent Children.
213052	214952	Yeah, because I, or AdventChildren.net.
215012	217013	Yeah, because I posted it on there, you dumbass.
218533	221214	No, everybody still doesn't believe that's coming out that day.
221454	226096	I'm hearing, I can't remember who the hell I heard this from.
226496	231618	I want to say it might have even been you, but about why Advent Children's being delayed.
233118	233618	The rumor?
233638	235619	Okay, rumor of a rumor, guys.
235679	236879	Take this with a grain of salt.
237339	239320	It's one of those, like,
240060	240400	and so on.
264383	267686	Take it with a grain of salt, guys, but just imagine the possibilities.
267706	279756	And if that's true, that it is, I mean, if we're talking limited IMAX engagement, we're talking very similar to what's going on in Tokyo, or not Tokyo, Japan, in cities like Tokyo, where they are going to be showing it in only like three or four cities for like a week.
279936	281637	That would probably be what happens here.
282098	284600	But take it with a grain of salt, guys.
284700	285060	I don't know.
285280	285560	I don't know.
285580	292206	Well, either way, it's coming out on November 29th, which is, you know, Tuesday, right before the holiday, you know.
293515	299436	I don't know, I wish it were coming out sooner, but that's the way they told me.
299696	301337	I'm like, oh no, why?
301597	305817	Most of the big gaming sites are agreeing with you now, so I was reading them this week.
305837	312298	Well, yeah, I mean, it's been pushed back a few times, so everyone's like, well, the Square Enix site's still saying it's coming out September.
312359	317299	Yeah, well, that's because they have nothing to do with the date that it comes out in, so whatever.
317799	319440	But, yeah, so that's what's going on.
319900	320620	All right, all right.
321965	328567	So, well, let's start off tonight's show by talking about, even though we've kind of already been talking about some games, we typically try to get this out in the beginning.
328627	330447	What games have we been playing this week?
330507	332007	So, Loki, what have you been up to this week?
332167	334828	Well, I've been playing a couple things.
335788	338089	Burnout 3, still, of course.
338289	342890	I'm almost done with it because we decided to cheat and unlock everything.
342970	346290	So, because we got, you know, we got tired of playing the same track over and over.
346310	349431	We're still playing it, though, because we now have really fast cars and
350134	357298	It's still even more fun to race, but I was also playing a little bit of Pack Picks.
357678	358218	I tried that.
358899	359259	How was that?
359279	360199	I saw that you picked that up.
360259	360800	How was that game?
361380	365462	It was one of those random buys I did, and it's okay.
365922	369004	I'm just not really kind of feeling the game.
369084	370204	It's just kind of like, eh.
370445	376908	It was one of those things where I played the tech demo at E3 a year and a half ago when the DS was first being shown.
377335	401800	and I then I heard that they were making it into a game and I was kind of like you're gonna take this concept and make it an actual game I mean I can see this being a minigame but from what I understand it came out okay like the best that that concept possibly could but it's it's it's okay but it's just like kind of it's it's like one of those things like oh but maybe it should be a minigame to something or maybe it should be like I don't know uh
402486	402706	It's okay.
429798	431399	I mean, it's probably not worth $30.
431539	433860	I paid for it, but it's still okay.
433880	434620	Wait for the bargain bin.
435561	436201	Definitely.
436261	439543	For a lot of the DS games, wait for the bargain bin.
439563	440103	$35 is a lot.
440403	441004	Well, I don't know.
441024	441584	I disagree with you.
441604	443545	I think Meteos is definitely worth the price.
445306	453930	Nintendogs, which I'm sure you're about to get to in a minute, is depending on if it's your kind of game, because you already know if you'd like Nintendogs or not, honestly.
454110	454630	You already know.
454690	456431	We don't have to tell you if it's a good or bad game.
457072	457812	You would know...
458419	460080	If you like these virtual pet kind of games.
460140	463942	So, sorry to steal your thunder, but I'm sure you've been playing a lot of Nintendogs as well.
465283	466744	I've been playing a little bit of Nintendogs.
467164	467584	A little bit?
467925	468985	Yeah, I bought all three.
470146	476069	Why did you buy all three when you can unlock all the dogs in one cartridge if you just network well enough?
477330	477830	I don't know.
478130	480652	I didn't know that, so I just bought all three.
480812	481232	Sucker.
482693	483794	You know, whatever.
483814	484754	It's okay.
485855	486095	All right.
486468	487329	Anything else you've been playing this week?
487349	487709	Burnout?
487970	488430	Nintendogs?
488870	490272	What did you think of Nintendogs?
490572	491513	Was it everything you'd hoped for?
492334	494997	Yeah, but the thing's kind of needy.
496778	504166	I don't have enough time to play this game and other games at the same time, so that's kind of tough.
505273	508194	yet you would log into Final Fantasy XI for hours on end.
508534	509674	That wasn't a problem.
509714	511775	I played a little bit of Final Fantasy XI this week.
512555	515996	I logged in for a couple hours because I hadn't played for two months.
516276	518356	I felt obligated.
520557	521317	That's it.
521757	522637	That's all the games you've been playing?
522757	523678	That's all I've been playing.
523698	524538	Next week should be better.
524618	526598	Oh, I played Marvel Nemesis Rise of the Imperfects.
526618	528159	That was the other one.
528299	532440	It's an awesome fighting game that they're going to be coming out with in September here.
532520	532940	It's just
533479	534320	I don't know, it was really neat.
534340	537702	They've got all the characters, plus they have these ones that EA actually made up.
538162	539003	So that was kind of neat.
541464	542485	Games I've been playing this week.
543466	544426	Nintendogs, of course.
544567	545607	I ran out and picked that one up.
546168	550431	I picked up the one that had the Shih Tzu in it, because as I promised everybody out there, I was going to get a Shih Tzu.
550891	553813	And I did have a Shih Tzu for a little while, but unfortunately, because...
554639	556120	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
579099	584123	and um did it translate well into a full game the five minute demo that they had at E3?
584563	602457	I think in most ways yes it did certainly in the very Nintendo way the cuteness factor the collectability aspect of it that's very you know Pokemon-ish and Animal Crossing-ish and other Nintendo games that they're famous for I think it really does deliver on all that and I really think it's a
603884	610900	A neat way to transform the Tamagotchi and Pokemon concept into something that will be very accessible to a lot of people.
610940	613125	I think it is going to be a very successful game.
613960	621104	My only beef with it is that the actual game elements of it, outside of training your dog, turned out to be kind of thin.
621624	631090	Granted, you have these trial competitions that you can do, the agility trial, where you teach your dog how to jump over hurdles and run through tubes and stuff.
631310	635272	There's the obedience competition, which is kind of boring, you just yell voice commands at your dog.
636013	640255	And a frisbee competition, I don't remember the exact name of it, but there's a frisbee competition as well.
641074	649017	Sort of wears a little bit thin, especially the fact that you have to sit through these two announcers who talk very slowly and have really lame jokes and stuff.
650177	653918	I was also a little bit disappointed that you couldn't do more with the head-to-head aspect.
653958	656199	Like, you couldn't go head-to-head in an agility trial.
656239	659100	At least, if you can, I haven't found this out yet or anything.
659160	664262	So, I was a little disappointed that all you can really do is exchange and play with each other's dogs.
664542	668483	Although that is a really neat concept, I would have liked to have seen something maybe a little more competitive.
668939	673361	You can, like, I guess because each game has certain items that are in each one.
673421	673641	Right.
674142	676903	So in order to get all the items, you have to have all the games.
676923	677343	Trade.
677383	680045	So I guess maybe it's more of a friendly competition.
680065	682146	It's a co-op game instead of a competitive game.
682166	688369	I would have liked to have seen maybe more ways that you could have pitted dogs up against each other to see who the better trainer is.
689269	691610	But I still think it's a very solid game.
691691	692471	I think it's a very...
693069	694910	A holiday edition has been trademarked.
715091	718313	Don't know if that's going to be something that actually happens, but who knows.
718594	725118	And I want to talk about DS expansions in one of our stories tonight, because it's very interesting the way they're expanding some of the DS games.
726639	731623	Other than Nintendogs, I really didn't play a whole lot of new stuff, just Final Fantasy XI.
731683	736046	I apologize, Loki, I didn't get to the copy of Hello Kitty Roller Rescue that you gave me last week.
736426	741730	I haven't had a chance to hook up the GameCube, so I'm trying to look for a better cable for it.
741750	743991	I need to get at least an S video for my high-def TV.
744011	744732	Okay.
746051	746932	and Halo 2.
747333	751057	Last night I went over to a friend's birthday party and it was just a bunch of guys playing Halo 2.
751838	757125	And somehow we got the idea that we'd get our friend who doesn't really play a lot of video games but really likes to talk shit.
757485	764174	We'd get him really drunk and he just got online and my friend who's really good at Halo, you know he's like a level 20 something and all the head to head stuff.
764594	767495	We got him to actually control and my friend to wear the headset.
767855	769835	So he just made fun of people the whole night.
769995	771536	Like, made fun of people's names.
771856	773696	He was making fun of people on the same team and stuff.
774057	775557	Highly immature stuff.
775997	777377	Highly, highly amusing.
779178	783579	It was so funny because there was this girl who ended up getting more kills than my friend in one match.
784079	787980	Either it was a girl or a little boy who hadn't gone through puberty yet.
788000	789141	Because the boys are really kind of like this.
789581	790741	And the person was going...
791951	796632	and just doing this dance in their living room or something and yelling at us on Xbox Live.
797452	800913	The joys of Xbox Live and talking smack.
804494	806754	Not so much fun if you're on the receiving end, though, I bet.
808114	810715	Anyway, let's get to that story about the expansion pack, actually.
810755	811955	I'll start off with this story tonight.
811975	816476	This is actually a game we've talked a little bit about on the show, but I don't know of a U.S.
816536	817436	release of this game yet.
817476	819917	It's actually a Japanese game called Jam with the Band.
819937	820597	Uh-huh.
821058	825780	And it's kind of one of those ones where you play the instruments on your DS and interactive title.
826060	830782	This hasn't come out in the US yet, but what is coming out in Japan, apparently the game has been very successful in Japan.
831222	833583	So they're going to be releasing an expansion pack.
834286	836788	But you have to have the DS game to be able to use the expansion pack.
837048	842951	The way the expansion pack works, it's a Game Boy Advance cartridge that plugs into the bottom slot of your DS.
843511	847134	And so 20 songs are loaded into the DS cartridge.
848094	851356	Songs that I don't recognize a whole lot of these songs.
851396	854798	A lot of them are Japanese titles, except for one of them.
855558	857920	And that's the Numa Numae song is on here, the, you know...
858320	859701	Dragostun, Tay, or whatever it's called.
859761	863265	That's in the expansion pack for Jam of the Band, along with some Nintendo favorites.
863325	867288	Star Fox 64, Super Mario 64 DS are all in this expansion pack.
867308	872773	But I think that's very... What's neat about this story, not so much the game, but the method of delivering the expansion.
873874	875075	It's cool that you mentioned that.
875555	878338	There's another game that's coming out similar to that.
878758	880560	Metroid Prime Pinball.
882318	882698	and DarkSakura.
897412	901153	I knew there was more to that advanced slot than just Game Boy Advance games.
901173	906015	If you think about it, this goes all the way back to Field of Magic XXY or whatever it is.
906435	915778	One of the launch titles where Secret Trick, if you put in I think it's Sonic Adventure 2 in your GBA slot, you unlock a Sonic costume on the DS cartridge.
916098	921139	So we've known forever the DS has this capability to interact with whatever game is in the bottom slot.
921559	923560	So if a Nintendogs
924226	940099	So hypothetically, if there is this holiday edition and an expansion pack is delivered, I'd bet you either it's going to be its own standalone cartridge where they try to get you to buy the same game over again because you can get cute Santa hats for your puppy, or it's going to be an expansion pack, which I think would be very cool.
940459	947084	Imagine that, an expansion pack that plugs in the advance that would work with all three titles and maybe unlock a particular breed of dog in no matter what game you own.
947104	947945	That would be cool.
949366	949927	We'll see, though.
949967	950247	We'll see.
951777	954578	Also in the news tonight, I was talking about Halo a little bit ago.
954598	963080	Of course, you guys probably heard that Halo is going to be turned into a movie projected to be about 2007 for this movie to come out.
963180	966181	Fox and Universal were the ones that teamed up to create this movie.
966821	972442	The script, as I understand, is being written by the guy who did 28 Days Later, Alex Garland.
972882	974523	But at the same time, he also did The Beach.
974983	975163	So...
977670	978312	Could be hit or miss.
978733	979235	So we'll see.
979315	979696	More news.
979776	983748	No stars attached yet, but I'm sure all of that will develop a little bit later on.
984634	985955	Also, I want to say about Halo.
986515	987976	This, I think, is very interesting.
987996	991178	There's going to be a Halo triple pack coming out before the end of the year.
991198	993019	Yeah, it's coming out in October.
993320	997522	It's going to be $60, or as they say, $59.99, but I say that's just $60.
998243	1003005	It's going to be Halo, Halo 2, and the Halo 2 multiplayer map pack.
1003466	1006768	Now, usually if you bought these games together, it would cost you about $80.
1007148	1010090	So it's kind of like you're getting a combo, burgers, fries, and soda, right?
1010650	1011711	But my question is...
1013363	1019624	Who that owns an Xbox, who is this aimed at?
1019684	1025946	Because if you own an Xbox, you have to own one of these games unless you're not a first person shooter type.
1026406	1028606	But if that's the case, I don't know why you own an Xbox.
1029967	1035488	No, all kidding aside though, there's sports titles, Ninja Gaiden, there's other Xbox titles that are good.
1036155	1037156	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1058661	1060642	at least the Halos will be backwards compatible.
1060682	1067506	This is going to be a good way to get people, you know, to catch up on Halo who might be joining Microsoft with the Xbox 360 and didn't have an Xbox.
1067867	1073330	But my thought along with that is, who's going to buy an Xbox 360 that isn't already an Xbox fan?
1073470	1073810	Exactly.
1073910	1074671	I don't know how many people.
1074751	1075851	You don't own an Xbox, right?
1076052	1076212	No.
1076472	1077332	Are you going to buy an Xbox 360?
1078153	1079874	Probably just because it's a next-gen system.
1079894	1084797	Okay, then you're the only person I've talked to that would plan to be buying an Xbox 360.
1084977	1086718	I guess there could be other folks out there, but I just...
1088779	1090200	Really, I'm not buying it for Halo.
1090881	1093263	If Halo comes out for it, I'm not going to buy it.
1093423	1095504	Are you buying it for Final Fantasy XI Pretty Edition?
1095564	1096145	No, hell no.
1096245	1097125	I'm not buying it for that.
1097145	1098506	I'm buying it for Project Gotham Racing 3.
1098807	1099667	That's what I'm buying it for.
1099687	1101028	That and Ridge Racer 6.
1101128	1101769	Hell yeah.
1101989	1103410	It's all about the racing games.
1103810	1111756	Okay, well then I guess I stand corrected because feasibly, with this lower price, they could taunt someone like you into buying this, although you're not a Halo fan.
1111896	1115539	I would not buy the stupid Halo expansion pack and that crap.
1115919	1116899	But you're not a Halo fan, either.
1116920	1122362	If you think about it, though, Halo 2 is probably going to drop in price here pretty quick anyways to about $20, and then it'll be just $60 anyways.
1122382	1123282	Oh, I disagree.
1123342	1125643	Halo, they're still asking $29.99 for Halo 1.
1125803	1126944	No, it's not.
1126964	1127464	It's dropped down to $20.
1127564	1129525	I saw it somewhere for $29.99.
1130165	1130866	Ah, no.
1131846	1132466	But whatever.
1132566	1133727	Mine came with my Xbox.
1133747	1135908	I have a pretty green Xbox, so I didn't have to worry about it.
1136008	1136648	Mine came with mine.
1136668	1138409	Except I thought Halo was part of that, you know...
1139076	1141560	The Best Hits or whatever they call them, Platinum.
1141720	1142501	It is and it isn't.
1142781	1147928	You know, it's the best selling Xbox game of all time, but they can still get away with charging $30 for it.
1147948	1156120	Yeah, you know, see everything in this collection of ours is supposed to be $17.99, but we just want some more money for it.
1156906	1157006	XBOX 360
1174151	1179636	has created a pack and they're calling this the ultimate Xbox 360 pack.
1180056	1196592	It comes with a system, Perfect Dark Zero, Project Gotham Racing 3, Elder Scrolls 4, Dead or Alive 4, Call of Duty 2, Gun, Quake 4, Tony Hawk, Condemned, Madden NFL 06, Cameo, Wireless Controller, Play and Charge Kit, Rechargeable Battery, 12-Month Card,
1196932	1199473	for Xbox Live one-year product replacement plan.
1199754	1202135	And it'll only set you back $1,199.83.
1202955	1207438	Yes, boys and girls, that was $1,199.
1207478	1211720	Not even... So go lie down your $5 now and reserve that.
1211740	1212581	This is retarded.
1212601	1212581	$50.
1212621	1212841	Oh, is it $50?
1212881	1214401	That's right, it's $50 for a system, huh?
1214642	1215162	Retarded.
1216303	1217463	Who would buy that crap?
1217523	1218143	Rich people?
1218544	1222486	I mean, seriously, though, you probably could go shop it and get it for a lot cheaper anyways.
1223206	1223967	Well, I don't know.
1223987	1224287	Maybe.
1224307	1224567	Maybe.
1224974	1226155	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1252534	1252834	DualSystems
1268021	1273365	Our email address, togo, T-O-G-O, at orangeloungeradio.com We'd like to hear from you.
1273425	1277068	It helps inflate our egos a little bit to know that there's folks out there listening.
1277268	1277429	Sure.
1277649	1280151	No, we'd like to hear from you guys and comment on the show and stuff.
1280771	1288397	Unfortunately, because Dark Sakura is out tonight and she's kind of the queen of our mailbox, I only have one letter tonight because it was something that was actually sent directly to me.
1288477	1290019	Somebody actually sent me an email directly.
1290379	1290999	But that's cool.
1291300	1292501	At least it gives me something to read tonight.
1292661	1292801	Okay.
1293001	1294582	And I thought it was a good email, so we're going to read this.
1295283	1296404	This comes to us from Flynn.
1297205	1301930	Flynn says, hello, I've just heard my first podcast of your show, courtesy of my PSP.
1302670	1310498	So I think it's very interesting that he's downloading the show on the PSP, because if you're a PSP owner, we're going to do something for you guys.
1310598	1313000	But we're not talking about it just yet.
1313020	1313641	We're working on it.
1314301	1315262	Hopefully within the month.
1315563	1318065	Oh, yeah, by the way, I forgot to mention this earlier this week.
1318345	1319526	I bought another PSP.
1319927	1321148	So I have two PSPs now.
1321188	1321488	Sucker.
1321809	1322269	All right, anyway.
1322748	1324750	So hello to those of you listening on your PSPs.
1324770	1327231	We're going to do something for you guys pretty soon.
1328833	1340401	Flynn wanted to comment on what a listener named Rob had to say about virtual ethics in regards to the Chinese exchange student using a bot to mug other players in Lineage 2 and sell their virtual loot for real cash.
1341262	1347667	Rob went on to say that virtual ethics or ethics in not a real place are inconsequential.
1347987	1348908	I can't talk tonight.
1349264	1350764	Too many syllables in that word.
1350804	1354045	I'm thinking about that Xbox DS and I'm seeing dollar signs all over.
1354065	1358847	Anyway, Flynn says, there's a famous saying, ethics is what you do in the dark when no one's watching.
1359147	1362488	I can think of no darker a place than cyberspace where no one can watch.
1362848	1366049	Would you empty the contents of a lost wallet if no one knew you had it?
1366209	1371470	Or would you track down the owner to return the wallet knowing no reward would be given and they would never find you if you did not?
1372088	1382357	Having never played Lineage 2, I can only assume that mugging and player killing are part of the many wonderful experiences you can participate in during the game, and that the student had not hacked the program in order to create these things.
1383228	1384469	I actually tried to do a little research.
1384589	1385369	Well, let me finish this letter.
1386991	1392174	I have also heard of people creating things in the virtual world to auction off for real cash, and as far as I know, this is not illegal.
1392574	1399199	That being said, mugging and PKing and selling virtual loot in the real world should not have led to an arrest, in my opinion.
1399479	1402001	The only crime was maybe the creation of the bot program.
1402281	1405923	However, everyone should be crystal clear in that his actions were unethical.
1406203	1412448	Do not believe for one second that you are a good, upstanding citizen in the real world while treating people like garbage in the virtual world.
1412628	1413088	Very good point.
1413629	1419541	doing awful things while hiding behind a screen name or handle is just revealing your true nature in the dark that comes to us from Flynn
1420336	1421097	Thank you for the email, Flynn.
1421197	1426181	I actually tried to do a little research as to whether Lineage 2 has that mugging feature built in.
1426501	1430264	So I went to Google, you know, like Lineage 2 mugging, and of course I just got a bunch of articles.
1430304	1435148	But I tried reading some, doing a little research, trying to see if mugging is something that's built into the game.
1435529	1444216	It's my understanding that although it sounds like PK is something that's built into the game, what this person did is the person wrote a bot program to automate
1444796	1446057	Doing all of these quests.
1446217	1449818	And doing things faster than a human can possibly do them.
1450198	1452039	So the bot would always win.
1452399	1453860	No matter what, the bot would win.
1454300	1455701	And the bot was basically unkillable.
1456221	1460643	So, in a way, he kind of, I guess, brought an exploit to light?
1460763	1461643	I don't know what you'd call it.
1462203	1464324	But I definitely agree with Flynn that it was unethical.
1464364	1467165	But Flynn says maybe they went a little far in arresting the guy.
1467726	1472708	So, your thoughts are welcome to go at OrangeLoungeRadio.com I don't know about unethical.
1472748	1473188	I mean, because...
1473809	1480174	One could say if you create a better way of doing something that's unethical, but I call it, you know, innovative.
1480194	1480895	Okay, you know what, though?
1480915	1481395	You know what, though?
1481415	1481996	There's a difference.
1482016	1485238	You're talking about cheating in Burnout 3 in single-player mode, right?
1485418	1486980	What you were doing earlier this week?
1488501	1489622	I downloaded a save.
1490462	1492824	That's different, because you're only affecting your game.
1492984	1501311	If you want to go on to Moviespoilers.com or whatever that site is, and you want to read the end to every movie that's out there, go for it.
1502421	1502962	Have fun.
1503302	1504624	Spoil the movies for yourselves.
1504764	1505325	Have a blast.
1506085	1510751	But if you go and tell all your friends about the spoilers, somebody's going to get pissed off at you about it.
1511152	1512033	I think it's kind of similar.
1512233	1515897	You can ruin the game for yourself if you want, but ruining the game for others is crossing the line.
1516058	1517059	That's kind of the way I look at it.
1517780	1518040	Yeah.
1518629	1519509	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1536238	1543163	Apparently these guys were hooking up the Xbox to their computer somehow so that they would always be the server.
1543423	1548606	And if they're the server, they can cause the other players to lag out and basically kill them while they can't move.
1549107	1550187	And I was watching this happening.
1550227	1553590	Sure enough, every couple minutes, lag, lag, lag, my friends are dead.
1553750	1554950	Lag, lag, lag, my friends are dead.
1555171	1556772	And everybody was bitching and complaining about this.
1556812	1560074	So somebody was doing this and the person had way many kills.
1560654	1562916	So, you know, I mean...
1564460	1565502	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1577091	1585698	Seriously, I realize we do an internet radio show where we talk about video games, but we try to talk about balance between that and having a personal life.
1585758	1589742	So please kids, stop cheating on Halo 2 to make your internet penis feel bigger.
1590342	1597388	Go out and get laid, because I'll tell you what, an orgasm feels 10,000 times better than owning some noob in Halo 2, at least in my opinion.
1599090	1600711	Maybe you feel differently, I don't know.
1603649	1605591	Follow-up to a previous story we talked about.
1606412	1610557	You know how we said that the firmware was going to be upgraded on the Sony PSP like two weeks ago?
1610737	1612319	Well, they were a little bit late.
1612759	1613680	Finally came out.
1613780	1614781	It was finally released.
1615542	1619046	It came out this past week, and now it's available on Sony's site.
1619066	1622790	So if you are interested in upgrading your firmware to 2.0, you can go ahead and do that.
1623331	1624112	What you're going to get?
1624740	1626080	New web browser application.
1626681	1628501	And it also has a tabbing feature.
1628521	1632122	You can have three tabs of browser windows open at once, which is kind of neat.
1633102	1638503	Other additions include 4-3 ratio, so you can watch TV programs, 4-3 screen mode.
1639283	1642564	AAC and WAV audio files are also added.
1642944	1645445	Check out the PlayStation site if you want more details.
1646065	1654489	I got to check out, because I checked out on Loki's new PSP, he upgraded it to 2.0, I checked out the web browser, and of course I'm loading OrangeLaunchRadio.com on the web browser, looking at it, and ooh, pretty.
1656591	1657791	Neat, I guess, neat.
1657891	1660673	It's a lot faster than the Wipeout browser, I'll give them that.
1660933	1663654	That's for sure, it's a lot faster than that.
1664214	1670958	And browsing's pretty easy, I don't like the stupid little text input that they have, but they're releasing keyboard for it, so...
1671271	1673652	Well, it's like a cell phone where you have to keep tapping one button.
1673672	1676613	They're going to be releasing a keyboard, so whatever.
1676673	1685157	But they actually did improve their method of entering stuff in because you can see how many times you've got to tab the button to get to your next letter.
1685237	1687138	But it's not that hard.
1687198	1690219	I mean, it's not going to be good for chatting or anything.
1690299	1700304	But even some of the IRC programs that they've made for it, like the one website, PSP IRC or something like that, they have a Java keyboard anyway, so you don't really need it.
1700764	1700904	Hmm.
1701598	1702599	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1721904	1723105	for their PSP launch.
1723165	1724846	It's called YourPSP.com.
1725506	1729289	And they're going to have movie trailers, downloadable games, and stuff like that.
1729509	1731290	And so I'll be interested when that happens.
1731530	1736153	And you could, essentially, if they're going to implement Flash, then you would be able to download Strong Bad.
1736893	1737213	Right?
1737253	1739555	You could listen to that on your PSP, right?
1739695	1741496	Yeah, I guess you could.
1742637	1746699	So, dude, we really need Strong Bad to burninate your PSP.
1746879	1749201	Well, you know, a lot of the kids out there would like that.
1749281	1749761	I don't know.
1750834	1751794	I like Strong Bad, he's funny.
1753655	1755056	Moving on, what do you got for us tonight, Loki?
1755176	1758318	Well, we got a couple things, a couple things in the rumor mills.
1759098	1766602	First off, starting that, IGN did this nice little look at the Game Boy Micro, which is coming out in September here in a couple weeks.
1767242	1772485	They did a bunch of size comparisons, and I can say that it's about the size of a stick of gum.
1774305	1776767	Because they have a winter fresh gum thing next to it.
1776847	1779448	It looks more like the size of the guy's cell phone in the picture you have there.
1779990	1781571	It's just a small Game Boy Advance.
1781591	1783593	I mean, if you really want to buy it again, go for it.
1783713	1785234	But, I don't know.
1785895	1787436	I don't see the point of buying this thing.
1787976	1792439	Some people out there might like the accessory-ness of this.
1792760	1793120	I don't know.
1793400	1800065	Well, the people that buy this thing and like the fact that you can change the face plates are the people that buy the stupid Game Boy Advances when they come out in different colors.
1800906	1801406	Do we really?
1801426	1802107	I mean, no.
1804068	1804949	No, I'm not buying that.
1805089	1805369	Anyways.
1806714	1815101	Um, the other thing was, is they had some info on, um, what they think is going to be revolutionary about the, um, Nintendo Revolution.
1815581	1821966	Now, granted, we're going to know in a few weeks what is revolutionary about it, because on the 16th, Nintendo's actually holding a press conference.
1821986	1823687	They're going to let all the cats out of the bag.
1823707	1824608	About time.
1825048	1827410	So, everything's going to be known about the Revolution.
1827530	1831012	But, in the meantime, we could speculate to, you know, the cows.
1831092	1832413	Alright, speculate away.
1832433	1835576	So, this speculation is supposedly by this guy, um,
1836278	1840459	Sponge, or whatever he claims to know what's going on.
1840499	1849182	And basically, he's said that there's going to be, it's going to make it so where that it's hard to turn the controller, like tilt the controller.
1849222	1859945	It's going to have gyroscopes in it, so it's going to be kind of like, almost like a rumble pack, but it's going to make it so that it feels like, for example, you're drifting around a corner, it'll give you G-forces, you know, going one direction or something.
1861125	1863666	I don't know how that's going to work, but that's an interesting idea, because it'll be
1864130	1869155	Revolutionary in the fact that this hasn't been done, and the fact that gyroscopes spin revolutionary.
1870597	1872018	Ah, cute, cute.
1872398	1874621	That's a theory, but I don't know.
1874721	1885311	My personal thing is I think it's going to be that, and I think if you've seen those keyboards out there that have the little LCD buttons on them, where they can change what the button looks like, I think that's going to be the other thing.
1886292	1887033	I think it's two things.
1887989	1888830	I don't know.
1889251	1890332	I'm totally speculating too.
1890452	1892355	But we'll know in a couple weeks on the 16th.
1892575	1895580	All the speculation comes back to the controller, which I think is interesting.
1896403	1901547	Yeah, and they said that that would be revolutionary, I'd imagine, but I don't know if it's revolutionary enough to sell the system.
1901567	1908491	You know what though, you're also assuming though, when you're saying that it's a play on the name, that the actual name of the system is going to be the revolution.
1908511	1910192	This is still a working title, correct?
1910212	1910493	Yeah.
1910513	1913775	They have not confirmed that this will be the actual name of the system.
1914035	1917497	And for the longest time, GameCube was what, Dolphin, I think they were calling it?
1917718	1918238	Yeah.
1918258	1918598	Or was that the 64?
1918678	1919839	I don't know, one or the other.
1919859	1920439	One of them, yeah.
1920459	1920840	Yeah.
1921480	1923100	And they changed the name before it was released.
1923140	1925381	So this may not actually be the Nintendo Revolution.
1925421	1927181	We may get a new name coming up.
1927842	1929842	Yeah, just like the Xbox 360.
1930022	1930962	What the hell was that?
1931042	1931302	I mean, 360?
1931662	1933963	That's retarded.
1934843	1935763	Xbox 2.
1936163	1937164	Xbox 360.
1937924	1938304	Why is it the 360?
1938344	1943385	Because we're going back around and doing the same thing all over again?
1943465	1943865	I don't know.
1945926	1946806	So anyways, there's that.
1947325	1953347	And speaking of the 360, and I mentioned this a couple weeks ago about the Origin 360 site.
1953788	1955908	Well, it's changing.
1956329	1959450	The site is changing, and there's more stuff happening.
1960370	1969654	Before, for those who might not remember, the Origin site had a picture of a tree with a countdown to sometime in September, and there was a bunny rabbit.
1969794	1969874	Okay.
1969894	1970054	Okay.
1970492	1974835	BunnyRabbits moved to the other side of the screen, the hole's getting bigger in the bottom of the tree, and there's apples growing.
1974955	1983040	And one of the apples is a symbol for the Windows Messenger, which is interesting.
1984001	1987884	So, integration with Windows Messaging for Xbox 360, maybe?
1987904	1992647	I mean, come on, this is a Microsoft product, of course they're going to have that.
1994034	1995395	Don't jump to conclusions.
1996576	1997836	It's just another viral site.
1997856	2005900	If you really want to check it out, originxbox360.com That's O-R-I-G-E-N xbox360.com Go look at the pretty bunny.
2008041	2011242	I guess something's going to happen with the bunny.
2012303	2013584	The controller will be a bunny.
2013984	2015204	I think the bunny should be a mascot.
2015545	2016605	We need a good bunny mascot.
2017225	2017966	It's a cardboard bunny.
2017986	2018666	It doesn't do anything.
2020712	2026535	I think it would have been funny, though, if you keep going back to the site, there's more bunnies up here or something like that.
2026575	2027396	That would be great.
2029617	2034320	No, really, other than that, well, I've got more hack and crack stuff, but we'll get into that later.
2034600	2035020	A little later?
2035180	2035580	Alright.
2035660	2036701	We'll do some more stories over here.
2037601	2042004	Tamagotchi's coming out for the DS, which shouldn't be much of a surprise when you consider that the Nintendogs was kind of a
2044653	2045354	Tamagotchi Corner Shop
2067254	2075743	You help Memichi or Kupachi set up a shop and the ultimate goal is to become Princess Tamako's favorite one.
2076724	2077104	Whatever.
2077805	2078025	Huh?
2078265	2078846	Yeah, whatever.
2078866	2080368	That's exactly what I said about this.
2080948	2085413	You can do a beauty salon or a flower shop and you do mini games with a DS stylus.
2086054	2086374	Huh?
2086754	2087255	Yeah, anyway.
2089513	2094694	So it's Harvest Moon, but with convenience stores.
2094954	2097415	With characters that were pop culture ten years ago.
2098515	2098895	You know.
2099255	2099475	What?
2099836	2105077	Speaking of Tomodachi, Neopets Darkest Fairy comes out next month.
2105777	2106897	Woo!
2107497	2110398	The fairy!
2110438	2113659	Nintendo is buying back 2.2 million shares.
2113779	2115899	The possible reason for this?
2117140	2118600	Square Enix trying to take over Taito.
2118988	2119789	Nintendo does not want
2147299	2149360	is kind of different and cute and does their own thing.
2149641	2152162	I think there's a partnership to be had here between Apple and Nintendo.
2153383	2153643	I don't know.
2154264	2155424	I was just randomly thinking that the other day.
2155524	2158206	You know, I think... What?
2158927	2159447	What the hell?
2159487	2160528	There's like a sticker on here.
2160548	2161628	On your DS?
2162149	2162769	Yeah, it came off.
2162789	2163870	Quit scratching over the stylus.
2164090	2174577	Anyways, I was thinking, just when you mentioned Apple and Nintendo, I was just thinking, the Apples are like the Volkswagen of the PC world.
2174617	2176038	That's what they reminded me of.
2177708	2183533	You can address those cards and letters to Loki at OrangeLongTrigger.com Look, they released cute stuff that's in different colors.
2183593	2185334	I mean, that's what Volkswagen does.
2185875	2187696	Cute cars suck.
2189078	2196624	Yeah, so by the way, in case you missed that underlying story within the story, Square Enix made a $600 million bid for Taito this week.
2196984	2197965	And what did we try to do?
2198005	2201268	We tried to figure out what would it sound like if we combined all three names?
2201288	2202389	Square, Enix, and Taito?
2202809	2203230	Squito.
2203450	2203910	Squito.
2204010	2204370	Squito.
2204551	2205211	I like Squito.
2205271	2206012	I like Squito, too.
2206977	2209619	So the company will hereforth be known as Squeedo.
2210720	2213802	Assuming this goes through, which I don't see why it won't at this point.
2213842	2214643	I mean, who cares?
2214743	2215143	So what?
2215203	2218566	I think it's a good thing.
2219286	2219707	Yeah, why not?
2221148	2221908	Metroid Prime.
2222048	2223189	You know how there was this big stink?
2223209	2227292	We even talked about this on the show a couple months ago where folks were saying that, oh, this game should have been online.
2227572	2229794	If you keep pushing this game back, it should have been online.
2230054	2231215	Why didn't you put this game online?
2231235	2232156	You keep pushing this back.
2232236	2236359	And Nintendo finally saying, Metroid Prime.
2236823	2237383	Going Online.
2238544	2238984	Prime Hunters.
2239444	2240245	Yes, Metroid Prime Hunters.
2240285	2240525	I'm sorry.
2240545	2241905	Metroid Prime Hunters will be going online.
2243386	2246488	It will be compatible with Nintendo's Wi-Fi service coming out later this year.
2247808	2249209	We just got pushback probably in November.
2250189	2250930	Everything else.
2252510	2255772	Can't Nintendo do any... Can't any game company do anything on time?
2257233	2261374	I wanted my Mario Kart, goddammit, for my birthday, and I had to wait until November.
2261695	2262835	That's not fair.
2263215	2264076	That Animal Crossing.
2264096	2264216	Sorry.
2264256	2264536	Sorry.
2265743	2270788	Speaking of the DS, Sony's flinging a little mud, calling the DS a gimmick this week.
2271869	2274772	Sony releasing some commentary this week.
2276253	2280057	Vice President of the Sony Studios, Phil Harrison, making the following comments.
2280718	2283961	The idea of a handheld rivalry with Nintendo is an irrelevance.
2284346	2286027	Those formats don't appear in our planning.
2286047	2287068	It's not a fair comparison.
2287108	2288308	Not fair on them, I should stress.
2288348	2290209	That sounds arrogant, maybe, but that's the truth.
2291210	2294812	We're just bitter that they're outselling us in Japan by a lot.
2295432	2297153	But here's the interesting quote here now.
2297654	2301756	But I fear that it won't have a lasting impact beyond that of a gimmick.
2302136	2307219	So the long-lasting appeal of the platform is at peril as a direct result of that.
2307679	2310281	Yeah, do you think that the DS is going to be the last handheld system?
2310461	2310721	No.
2311778	2312438	Here's another one.
2312719	2319842	Nintendo knows its target audience because it has really narrowed that down, and it's pretty much defined by a boy or girl's ability to admire Pokemon.
2320383	2321183	Ooh, burn!
2322918	2326320	Yeah, and what's the PSP had released for now?
2327181	2329943	Rehashes of crappy games that were out on the PlayStation.
2331384	2331664	You know what?
2331784	2339729	I like the PSP, and I don't want to take sides in the PSP versus DS war, because the PSP does have a lot of great features, especially in the fact that it's a multimedia system.
2339769	2343392	However, in games, PSP's lacking a little bit right now.
2344072	2348435	Realize there's good stuff on the horizon, like Grand Theft Auto, but as far as I'm concerned...
2349369	2353751	Don't start making these comments until you get the games to back it up, because Luminous is just one game.
2354371	2356352	Seriously, I have both, and you know what?
2357092	2360073	I'm looking at the lineup of games coming out for the PSP.
2360613	2361554	Ain't nothing impressive.
2362354	2368777	But earlier, I bet if we went back to archives of the show from February, you would hear me saying the same crap about the DS, right?
2368797	2372018	Before the PSP came out, where DS needs to put out some games.
2372931	2379514	DS has a ton of stuff coming out.
2379554	2381715	A ton of stuff just being released.
2381755	2383536	PSP, one or two a month.
2384496	2385116	With UMDs.
2385356	2385757	Galore.
2386537	2387277	Yeah, tons of movies.
2387777	2390479	Good for movies, but you know what?
2390619	2391359	It's a gaming system.
2392359	2397041	It's a gaming system, not an internet browser, not a movie player It's a gaming system
2411508	2422096	But when the PSP launches in Europe this week, which, by the way, PSP's launching in Europe this week, one of the games that's going to be released for it is going to let you have a custom soundtrack, and it's Touka Race Driver 2.
2422436	2427980	You can have a custom soundtrack option, and if you have music stored on your memory stick, you can use that as the music you listen to in-game.
2428901	2429301	It's pretty cool.
2429622	2430362	That's a cool idea.
2430482	2430983	Now, there you go.
2431763	2440730	Now, to use the feature, by the way, you have to download the free exact audio copy utility from Codemasters UK website.
2441018	2446019	That's Codemasters.co.uk So, check that out.
2447300	2452261	North American release not announced yet, but Codemasters does bring a lot of their Europe games over here.
2452281	2453722	Toka is one.
2453842	2455362	I'm sure it'll be here in a minute.
2456502	2457523	What else you got for us tonight, Loki?
2457783	2464105	Well, speaking of the PSP, lots of stuff when it comes to doing things on the PSP that you're not supposed to.
2464665	2468566	Number one would be they found a way, or I should say
2469087	2469967	It's going to be released next week.
2469987	2480029	They found a way to turn back the clock or to bring the PSP from version 1.52 or 1.51 back to 1.5.
2480449	2483830	So like a DD level, your PSP.
2483870	2489191	Basically, you can take your PSP and turn it back to 1.5.
2491051	2494952	Only if you haven't upgraded to 2.0 because stuff gets a little different when you get to 2.0.
2495669	2495689	P6
2524307	2525695	which looks amazing.
2525796	2526863	It's got actually...
2527841	2529582	They've done everything from being able to play videos.
2529602	2531042	It looks just like Windows, sort of.
2531902	2533843	You can play audio files and that type of stuff.
2533883	2534403	Homebrew.
2534663	2537624	Wait, so this is a... It's like a shell.
2537884	2538925	Okay, for PSP?
2539045	2539405	For PSP.
2539445	2543626	It's like a way, like it alters the way things look and feel in the shell.
2543686	2543886	Okay.
2544026	2546287	What's also cool about it, though, they've added a ton of other stuff.
2546327	2554590	Like, for example, they are using a camera phone, this like add-on for some Sony Ericsson camera phone.
2555840	2564722	to actually be able to have a webcam on it so you can actually take pictures with your PSP, which is very interesting, actually.
2565942	2569582	So that's going to be coming out, and I'm sure they're going to have a web browser and stuff.
2570443	2572163	Tons of work being done on it.
2572943	2575143	Website with more info for this?
2575363	2580184	PSPUpdates.com has an interview, actually, with a guy who goes by the name Fluff.
2580564	2584885	They were hosting some cool kind of...
2585626	2586586	Oh, the Atari 2600 in there?
2586686	2586826	Awesome!
2586846	2587287	Adventure time.
2615689	2618491	It's time to play some... Sword Quest, here I come.
2618511	2619452	You know what they need to do?
2619652	2623414	Stella with some, like, you know, ad hoc compatibility stuff.
2623434	2625495	How about Stella with some wireless multiplayer?
2625516	2626836	Say I can play two-player combat.
2626896	2628037	Yeah, combat, it's on.
2628678	2629558	That'd be awesome.
2630479	2631820	They need to make a new combat game.
2631940	2633601	Atari needs to remake combat.
2633941	2636303	We need to have a petition for them to remake combat.
2636323	2636663	Didn't they?
2637023	2641586	I thought it was one... Because you know how they remade Pong and, uh... I don't think they did combat.
2641666	2644028	I know they did Pong, I know they did Fogger...
2645282	2649424	All these Atari ones are being remade.
2650124	2651285	Warlords was one.
2652005	2653165	Didn't they do combat?
2653205	2654386	They might have done combat.
2654426	2655006	Well, whatever.
2655026	2655746	They should do it again.
2656867	2657287	Make it better.
2658007	2658608	Here's the thing.
2658648	2661749	The PSP needs more games that are actually over the internet.
2662109	2663610	They've got a couple so far.
2664770	2666171	It took the DS a year or so.
2666721	2669022	Give the PSP till E3 next year.
2669302	2669962	I don't know.
2670022	2672142	I mean, that was one of the things that they're pushing.
2672182	2673282	You can play people over the internet.
2673302	2673863	Not yet.
2674103	2674523	Not yet.
2675423	2675583	Yeah.
2675823	2676123	We'll see.
2676243	2676503	We'll see.
2677783	2678043	All right.
2678564	2678864	Is that it?
2679684	2680184	That's for now.
2680244	2680424	Yeah.
2681004	2690546	You know the only thing, though, about Stella, though, and Atari 2600 emulation, you know, in all honesty, even though I talk wonderful things about these games, Kaboom, of course, another one of my favorites, Pitfall 2, love it.
2691726	2693847	The emulation thrill usually only lasts about five minutes.
2695512	2696093	DarkSakura.com
2714807	2717528	at the Ragnarok Festival, which was held in July.
2717608	2722848	Gravity said that they will reveal Ragnarok 2 online at the Tokyo Game Show.
2723189	2732390	The show is taking place September 16th, so if you're a fan of Ragnarok online, stay tuned to September and the Tokyo Game Show because they're going to have more information about Ragnarok 2.
2733090	2734371	That's really all I've got to say about that.
2734391	2735691	There was nothing else in that story.
2736631	2741692	Tekken 5 is going to be re-released in the arcades as Tekken 5
2742847	2747632	Dark Resurrection, and it's going to have two new characters as well as some newly rendered backgrounds.
2748473	2755281	It's going to be shown at the Amusement Machine Show in Japan on September 1st and should make its way to arcades this winter.
2756899	2785836	FYI they're also going to be showing some other interesting Namco games at this show Druaga Online which I think is really weird like suddenly Druaga is really big with Namco again you might remember this old old old old old game in the arcades Tower of Druaga I think it is well they recently released a PS2 Druaga title and now they've got Druaga Online so I guess they and I didn't maybe it was one of those things that was big in Japan and I just missed it somehow but I don't know as far as I know that series was dormant for like 20 years but I could be wrong don't send hate mail
2787304	2793347	Soul Calibur 3 has a date for Japan, November 24th, which is a little bit sooner than I expected.
2794248	2798370	November 24th for Japan, get this, October 25th for America.
2798630	2801152	I thought that this was a game we wouldn't be getting until next year.
2801212	2802633	Apparently I fell asleep on this one.
2803813	2813499	Four new characters, according to Famitsu Magazine, that are also going to be in this game, Soul Calibur 3, Maxi, Song Mina, Zhang Hua, and Young Sung will also be in Soul Calibur 3.
2814339	2816200	and that's in addition to those previously announced characters.
2816220	2818282	And of course, make your own characters.
2819002	2825767	Soul Calibur 3 will also be having a battle arena mode where you can set certain conditions for the fight to be able to win the fight.
2826007	2827948	So, might make for some interesting...
2830654	2834276	I guess these are things that are built in Battle Arena.
2834296	2834657	I'm not sure.
2834777	2842061	Coin Collector, where you have to collect as many coins as you can by attacking the opponent, and the coins you get are based on the attacks that you land on the opponent.
2842081	2843522	Soul Calibur Party or something?
2843682	2844182	I don't know.
2845403	2852247	The Statue Dances is another mode where you fight against a large stone statue that's eight times the size of your character.
2852867	2854649	And it dances?
2854689	2854789	Yeah.
2856141	2865003	No, it attacks because you're fast, but the statue is very slow, but it's very powerful, so you have to be quick, I guess.
2865463	2867963	Everybody party!
2870304	2870904	Interesting.
2871704	2872884	They're doing interesting things with it.
2872924	2873764	I think it'll be kind of cool.
2874684	2883566	Nintendo, of course, with their release of Nintendogs, they have a new partnership between Dogs Trust for the American and European release of Nintendogs.
2883922	2890928	Just to kind of remind people that, you know, raising a puppy in real life is a lot more complicated than it is in Nintendogs.
2891708	2893710	You can't turn off a real puppy.
2894531	2896733	And I noticed this in the manual of the game, even.
2896753	2902317	There's this big disclaimer about, you know, if you want to get a real puppy, keep in mind they don't stay puppies forever.
2902777	2903638	Something to that effect.
2903678	2905260	So if you own Nintendogs, check it out.
2905300	2906180	It's in the front of the manual.
2906200	2907541	An interesting little disclaimer there.
2907561	2907621	Huh.
2908755	2914877	Dogs Trust, their marketing director, Adrian Bruder, saying, Dogs Trust is pleased to be associated with Nintendogs.
2915177	2921419	The philosophy behind the game has a lot in common with our own aims of ensuring that every dog is a happy and loved pet.
2921719	2927241	Despite the fame of our Dog is for Life slogan, thousands of dogs are still abandoned and unwanted every year.
2927321	2934644	So it's great that there's a game that's not only fun to play, but supports the message that responsible dog ownership means more than giving your dog an occasional stroke.
2936129	2937970	He could have used better word choice there, but whatever.
2941673	2943534	I only think of South Park right now.
2943814	2945235	Raid Rocket, Raid Rocket, Raid Rocket.
2946135	2947236	Any more stories for us, Loki?
2948077	2949558	No, I don't.
2950278	2951099	I was just reading.
2951299	2957843	There's some interesting thing they're talking about online poker sites and people botting on that and winning real money.
2959046	2962107	Ooh, it's just a matter of time before something like that happens.
2962748	2963348	Interesting.
2963368	2965089	I'm like, hmm.
2965109	2982776	Because when I was, that email I read today, when I was doing some of the research, I actually was reading comments on, I don't know, Slashdot or some other site, where people were saying, if somebody, it's just a matter of time before somebody does this in a game where it's real money at stake, as opposed to fake items worth real money in the online auction world.
2982856	2985998	Yeah, I guess it's on this game called Win Hold'em, and...
2987031	3008106	I guess it's just articles about the rise of internet botting and they're talking about on the internet nobody knows you're a bot and I guess last year the poker sites raked in 1.4 billion dollars and I mean just someone runs a bot and they can win tons of money.
3008927	3009607	It's kind of crazy.
3011549	3011929	Interesting.
3012209	3012429	Yeah.
3013850	3014111	Alright.
3014411	3015972	I guess we're on to our last story of the night.
3017486	3020467	and the last story of the night has to do with male nudity in a video game.
3020667	3021087	Oh god.
3022787	3025228	I'm sure DarkSakura should be very happy right now.
3025548	3027188	No, no, don't shut off your iPod just yet.
3027248	3028028	No, no, don't turn it off.
3028469	3030089	There's actually more to this story here.
3031089	3034330	It's actually a Midway game and it's their Blitz series.
3034650	3036230	So it's like a football series of games.
3036390	3038711	Yeah, Blitz the League because, you know...
3039167	3040528	They can't use NFL anymore.
3040728	3041309	Yeah, exactly.
3041389	3042169	So they don't do this.
3042209	3043350	So it's just Blitz the League.
3044150	3053357	Now, what's interesting is that supposedly, rumor is it's one of their viral marketers, the people that pose as regular fans that are infiltrating the message board.
3053377	3058340	Well, there was a post on the Midway message boards that's a screenshot from Blitz the League.
3058760	3061682	And it shows a cheerleader about ready to pull her shirt off.
3061943	3064704	So, you know, she's going to show her boobs, which is nothing new in a video game.
3065045	3068187	But what's also interesting about it is that there's a streaker...
3069179	3069579	and DarkSakura.com
3098757	3103078	We're gonna add drug use, and we're gonna, you know, add nudity, I guess.
3103158	3107659	So, it's a mature... Out of all the football games that come out, this is a mature-rated football game.
3108099	3109960	The rest are for everybody.
3111520	3115701	I'm interested because, you know, NFL Blitz was awesome, so this should be no different.
3115981	3118402	Props to Midway for thinking creative, I guess.
3118842	3124623	You know, those games like Madden and stuff, even though we don't talk a whole lot about sports games, because honestly, I just don't play them.
3124743	3126043	Madden was a disappointment.
3126303	3128244	From what I've heard from people that have been playing, they're like,
3129200	3135903	But previous sports titles, all these EA sports titles, they get more and more realistic and they start feeling like you're watching Monday Night Football.
3136664	3140886	Midway's taking that one step further with the realism aspect by adding the streakers.
3142807	3143287	Interesting.
3143627	3144868	Final thoughts, Loki, tonight?
3146368	3147389	I'll check out the game.
3147813	3152316	Midway's coming in next week, so I'll have some questions for them.
3152456	3153436	All right, sounds good.
3154557	3157859	My final thought is thank you guys very much for listening, and hey, send us an email.
3157919	3164243	Let us know how we're doing, togo, T-O-G-O, at orangeonstrade.com, or if you want to contact one of us directly, send Loki some hate mail.
3164750	3169473	or me some fan mail, you can always check that out on our website, www.orangeloungevideo.com.
3169733	3176156	And apologies to fans of our three-hour show that didn't get to hear us this Sunday because we had to cancel our live show this week.
3176496	3177197	We'll be back next week.
3177237	3178898	Got lots of music for you for next week.
3179218	3181359	Yes, we got a lot of Mimani remixes coming up on next week's show.
3181459	3187062	And I got to beg Tomo, which is the distributor of Age Tech, to make an RPG make for the PSP.
3187502	3188563	That's my goal next week.
3188905	3189225	Very cool.
3189485	3195047	And I received a bucket load of information on Percussion Master this week, so I'm going to be talking about that next week's show.
3195167	3195387	Okay.
3195547	3195808	All right.
3196428	3197308	Anyway, that's that.
3197348	3199509	Thanks for downloading our podcast and listening to us.
3199589	3200589	We appreciate your support.
3200909	3213234	Tell a friend about Orange Zones Radio to go, because honestly, when we have to compete against the bigger and bigger guys, ABC and all these other big podcasts that are out there, the only way that indie podcasts stay alive
3215568	3219850	I guess to get bigger at all and get the word out is for people to tell other people.
3219910	3223111	Yeah, we try getting Leo Laporte, but he just doesn't want to.
3223791	3224512	He's got his own podcast.
3224532	3226592	He said something about going back to G4 or something.
3228273	3228853	Poor guy.
3229393	3230794	Fight the fight from the inside.
3230814	3233195	On that note, good night everybody.
3233215	3233655	Have a good one.
3235225	3238812	That's the end of another Orange Lounge Radio To Go edition.
3239113	3244643	This podcast is a proud part of www.orangeloungeradio.com.
3245104	3246106	See you next update.
