[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of August 15th, 2005.

2
00:00:03,078 --> 00:00:13,550
[SPEAKER_01]: You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.

3
00:00:13,791 --> 00:00:17,195
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.

4
00:00:18,755 --> 00:00:28,237
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, once again, everybody, and welcome to another edition of Orange Lounge Radio To Go, your home for discussion on video games that don't suck.

5
00:00:28,677 --> 00:00:32,317
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all the news you really want to know about here on Orange Lounge Radio.

6
00:00:32,837 --> 00:00:35,718
[SPEAKER_03]: And big thank you to those of you guys who helped us.

7
00:00:35,778 --> 00:00:39,379
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you mentioned this, Loki, last week, but since I wasn't here last week, I'm back, by the way.

8
00:00:39,419 --> 00:00:39,679
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.

9
00:00:40,319 --> 00:00:42,659
[SPEAKER_03]: They shipped him back.

10
00:00:42,839 --> 00:00:43,939
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's introduce ourselves.

11
00:00:44,279 --> 00:00:45,179
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Rob Roberts.

12
00:00:45,199 --> 00:00:46,160
[SPEAKER_03]: You might know me as Sky.

13
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,060
[SPEAKER_03]: Joining me is DarkSakura.

14
00:00:49,016 --> 00:00:52,118
[SPEAKER_00]: How did you get through all the packing tape and the bubble wrap?

15
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:52,939
[SPEAKER_03]: Very slowly.

16
00:00:52,979 --> 00:00:54,099
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I was gone two weeks.

17
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,241
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, it took you that long.

18
00:00:56,381 --> 00:00:58,342
[SPEAKER_00]: I just thought that they just got tired and shipped you back.

19
00:00:59,183 --> 00:01:00,103
[SPEAKER_03]: Possibly a little bit of that.

20
00:01:00,483 --> 00:01:01,604
[SPEAKER_03]: And the one and only Loki.

21
00:01:01,964 --> 00:01:02,445
[SPEAKER_03]: I am here.

22
00:01:03,065 --> 00:01:03,465
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, you are.

23
00:01:04,086 --> 00:01:05,567
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so we were...

24
00:01:07,458 --> 00:01:10,161
[SPEAKER_03]: We were kind of in an interesting position last week.

25
00:01:10,201 --> 00:01:19,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Since I wasn't here, Loki and DarkSakura couldn't use the regular studio, so they effectively had to record last week's show through two tin cans and a piece of string or something like that.

26
00:01:19,792 --> 00:01:20,893
[SPEAKER_03]: No, seriously.

27
00:01:20,913 --> 00:01:22,295
[SPEAKER_00]: A laptop and a headset.

28
00:01:22,315 --> 00:01:23,276
[SPEAKER_03]: A laptop and a headset.

29
00:01:23,737 --> 00:01:26,740
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had to edit in stuff, so don't complain.

30
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:31,963
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're wondering why last week's show sounded a little bit different, it's because it wasn't in the usual studio.

31
00:01:32,003 --> 00:01:32,644
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know what, kids?

32
00:01:32,684 --> 00:01:35,385
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how dedicated we are to giving you new material every week.

33
00:01:35,705 --> 00:01:38,587
[SPEAKER_03]: Some shows would have just said, oh, screw it, we're going to take the week off.

34
00:01:39,107 --> 00:01:39,707
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope, not us.

35
00:01:40,928 --> 00:01:41,168
[SPEAKER_02]: Not us.

36
00:01:42,423 --> 00:01:45,106
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, I just want to personally thank... I know Loki thanked last week.

37
00:01:45,126 --> 00:01:50,791
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to personally thank you guys for helping us out with the podcast awards and getting us a win over there for Best Gaming Podcast.

38
00:01:50,811 --> 00:01:51,852
[SPEAKER_03]: That's amazing.

39
00:01:51,892 --> 00:01:52,413
[SPEAKER_03]: That's incredible.

40
00:01:52,593 --> 00:01:54,054
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't even... Wow.

41
00:01:54,395 --> 00:02:03,183
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, this podcast was originally supposed to be the little side show that we figured, oh, maybe a couple people will download it, the ones that listen to our three-hour show, and it'll be cute.

42
00:02:03,664 --> 00:02:04,825
[SPEAKER_03]: But now this thing is just like...

43
00:02:05,385 --> 00:02:06,305
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

44
00:02:34,127 --> 00:02:35,248
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

45
00:03:03,546 --> 00:03:06,012
[SPEAKER_00]: Send those to DarkSakura.

46
00:03:06,092 --> 00:03:06,333
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

47
00:03:07,596 --> 00:03:09,560
[SPEAKER_03]: See, I knew that would change your mind a little bit.

48
00:03:09,986 --> 00:03:15,651
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be Jamie spelled J-A-M-I-E, not J-A-I-M-E.

49
00:03:15,751 --> 00:03:16,391
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello!

50
00:03:16,591 --> 00:03:17,532
[SPEAKER_03]: Or J-A-M-Y.

51
00:03:17,592 --> 00:03:18,393
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no.

52
00:03:18,473 --> 00:03:20,114
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, they've been misspelling my name.

53
00:03:20,274 --> 00:03:20,975
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, well, yeah.

54
00:03:21,395 --> 00:03:22,656
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is on our website.

55
00:03:22,716 --> 00:03:23,777
[SPEAKER_00]: Freaking spell it right.

56
00:03:24,277 --> 00:03:28,681
[SPEAKER_00]: J-A-M-I-E at orangeloungeradio.com.

57
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:29,421
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can send you money.

58
00:03:29,441 --> 00:03:31,923
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm taking my wedding presents and Amazon gift certificates.

59
00:03:32,164 --> 00:03:32,524
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

60
00:03:33,244 --> 00:03:34,125
[SPEAKER_03]: Since I'm not registered anymore.

61
00:03:34,145 --> 00:03:35,646
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll have to let me know if you actually get anything.

62
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:36,267
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be kind of cool.

63
00:03:36,647 --> 00:03:37,608
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be kind of cool.

64
00:03:37,908 --> 00:03:40,430
[SPEAKER_03]: So no other games in between there?

65
00:03:41,651 --> 00:03:45,393
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I did play a couple things with Dan.

66
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:46,114
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing major.

67
00:03:46,134 --> 00:03:46,935
[SPEAKER_00]: I played some PSO.

68
00:03:47,855 --> 00:03:53,259
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I've been so busy trying to get my school stuff set up, I haven't been able to dedicate as much time to games.

69
00:03:53,399 --> 00:04:00,705
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I hate to call you out on something, but you told me during the three-hour show tonight that you haven't been able to put down that Nintendogs five-minute demo.

70
00:04:00,745 --> 00:04:02,726
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I played it five times.

71
00:04:02,746 --> 00:04:02,866
[SPEAKER_00]: What?

72
00:04:04,447 --> 00:04:04,987
[SPEAKER_00]: in the same day.

73
00:04:05,087 --> 00:04:06,388
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought you said you like burned it out.

74
00:04:06,428 --> 00:04:07,208
[SPEAKER_03]: You played it so much.

75
00:04:07,308 --> 00:04:11,849
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's just I was getting frustrated because I kept playing Frisbee with the puppies and then I was like, oh, five minutes is up.

76
00:04:12,009 --> 00:04:12,349
Bing!

77
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:14,570
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, ah, I don't play with puppies.

78
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:17,191
[SPEAKER_03]: You only have just like a little over a week to go.

79
00:04:17,511 --> 00:04:18,271
[SPEAKER_03]: A little over a week to go.

80
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:19,011
[SPEAKER_03]: Puppies.

81
00:04:19,971 --> 00:04:21,292
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, what's been going on in your gaming world?

82
00:04:21,572 --> 00:04:23,012
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been playing lots of games.

83
00:04:23,572 --> 00:04:24,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Mostly Burnout 3.

84
00:04:25,693 --> 00:04:26,553
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that game.

85
00:04:26,873 --> 00:04:27,614
[SPEAKER_04]: Every single minute.

86
00:04:28,154 --> 00:04:32,795
[SPEAKER_04]: I must look like some really hardcore crazy guy at my work because I bring my PlayStation to...

87
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:33,979
[SPEAKER_04]: to work.

88
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,240
[SPEAKER_04]: I set it up.

89
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:39,943
[SPEAKER_04]: Within a 15-minute break, we play two races and disassemble it and take it back upstairs.

90
00:04:40,023 --> 00:04:40,744
[SPEAKER_04]: Who makes Burnout 3?

91
00:04:40,904 --> 00:04:41,004
[SPEAKER_04]: EA.

92
00:04:42,545 --> 00:04:44,606
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they paying you under the table to say good things about it?

93
00:04:44,846 --> 00:04:44,946
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

94
00:04:45,246 --> 00:04:45,947
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a great game, though.

95
00:04:46,267 --> 00:04:49,889
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's also, what's awesome about it is they've price reduced it already, so it's $19.99.

96
00:04:49,929 --> 00:04:51,370
[SPEAKER_04]: You can go out and get it.

97
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:55,833
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really anticipating Burnout Revenge, which is coming out in September, which will be awesome.

98
00:04:56,705 --> 00:05:04,048
[SPEAKER_04]: Other than that, I've been playing just a variety of import games from Taiko no Tatsujin for the PlayStation Portable, which is a lot of fun.

99
00:05:04,728 --> 00:05:10,270
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I've also been playing, I tried playing a little bit of Genji Dawn the Samurai, which is going to be coming out here in September.

100
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:12,351
[SPEAKER_04]: Really looks cool.

101
00:05:12,811 --> 00:05:13,691
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that game.

102
00:05:13,751 --> 00:05:14,752
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just so pretty.

103
00:05:15,332 --> 00:05:18,533
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wish I could understand dialogue because I can't read Japanese, but whatever.

104
00:05:19,093 --> 00:05:21,234
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Namco X Capcom, which looks fantastic.

105
00:05:21,994 --> 00:05:23,335
[SPEAKER_04]: Disappointing, actually.

106
00:05:23,395 --> 00:05:23,695
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

107
00:05:24,275 --> 00:05:27,257
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was going to be a cool role-playing game type thing.

108
00:05:27,317 --> 00:05:31,079
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a tactical RPG, and I don't like tactical RPGs.

109
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:35,182
[SPEAKER_03]: When you say tactical RPG, you mean like Advance Wars, Final Fantasy Tactics style?

110
00:05:35,202 --> 00:05:37,263
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Final Fantasy Tactics, yeah, exactly.

111
00:05:38,283 --> 00:05:40,285
[SPEAKER_04]: I was expecting something different.

112
00:05:41,425 --> 00:05:42,926
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks, the intro movie's cool.

113
00:05:42,986 --> 00:05:44,907
[SPEAKER_03]: But you never got into Tactics or Disgaea?

114
00:05:45,047 --> 00:05:46,008
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope, I never did.

115
00:05:46,228 --> 00:05:47,069
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like them.

116
00:05:47,249 --> 00:05:49,490
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of like those games, so I've got to check this out.

117
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:50,370
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

118
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:52,411
[SPEAKER_04]: But it'll be cool when it comes out over here.

119
00:05:52,712 --> 00:05:53,632
[SPEAKER_04]: And we love Katamari.

120
00:05:53,912 --> 00:05:55,053
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been loving that game.

121
00:05:56,233 --> 00:05:59,035
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to be playing this week 187 Ride or Die.

122
00:05:59,335 --> 00:06:01,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I tried Seven Sins too this week.

123
00:06:02,316 --> 00:06:05,218
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like The Sims 2, just with nudity.

124
00:06:06,717 --> 00:06:08,418
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, it's exactly like it.

125
00:06:09,078 --> 00:06:10,780
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really interesting and very annoying.

126
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Seven Sins.

127
00:06:13,482 --> 00:06:15,443
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure that made Jack Thompson a very happy man.

128
00:06:16,044 --> 00:06:16,904
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's in Europe.

129
00:06:17,144 --> 00:06:17,845
[SPEAKER_04]: What's he going to do?

130
00:06:17,985 --> 00:06:19,826
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell the Europeans to stop their games?

131
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:20,787
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't care about nudity.

132
00:06:20,807 --> 00:06:22,288
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop being naked all the time.

133
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:27,312
[SPEAKER_04]: Next week, though, I'm playing 187 Ride or Die in Darkwatch for sure.

134
00:06:28,426 --> 00:06:55,770
[SPEAKER_03]: you got a busy busy gaming schedule I wish my list of games was as impressive but sadly since I've been traveling all I've had is handhelds I finally bought my own copy of Luminous because it's this long going story if you've listened to the podcast for several weeks now I bought a copy of Luminous before I had the PSP my friend accidentally took it one weekend I ended up just giving it to him as a birthday present because he loved it so much and I finally went and bought my own copy while I was traveling since I was on the east coast for a couple weeks um

135
00:06:56,230 --> 00:07:02,272
[SPEAKER_03]: I went to a DDR tournament while I was out on the East Coast and I played a new game called Percussion Master, which is pretty cool.

136
00:07:02,292 --> 00:07:06,833
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a cross between Taiko no Tatooine and Drum Mania, if you're familiar with those games.

137
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:10,874
[SPEAKER_03]: Taiko Drum Master was the American name of Taiko no Tatooine.

138
00:07:11,674 --> 00:07:12,534
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty cool game.

139
00:07:12,714 --> 00:07:13,194
[SPEAKER_03]: I liked it.

140
00:07:13,295 --> 00:07:14,455
[SPEAKER_03]: I loved the song list.

141
00:07:14,535 --> 00:07:15,215
[SPEAKER_03]: It was fun.

142
00:07:15,915 --> 00:07:18,856
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's a game that I think might wear thin a little quickly because...

143
00:07:19,264 --> 00:07:19,944
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

144
00:07:39,657 --> 00:07:41,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, I've just been playing a lot of handheld games.

145
00:07:42,059 --> 00:07:49,344
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually tried, I kind of forced myself to try and play some DS games that I originally had given negatives reviews for on the show.

146
00:07:49,384 --> 00:07:50,405
[SPEAKER_03]: One of them being Polarium.

147
00:07:50,905 --> 00:07:52,767
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry kids, still can't get into Polarium.

148
00:07:53,067 --> 00:07:54,208
[SPEAKER_03]: Yoshi Touch and Go.

149
00:07:55,356 --> 00:07:58,718
[SPEAKER_03]: After playing Kirby Canvas Curse, it kind of has a dual effect.

150
00:07:58,818 --> 00:08:12,364
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm able to understand Yoshi Touch and Go more, and I'm able to get a little better at it and have a little more fun with it, but to me, it still feels like you're paying a full price for a game for just a two-level game, and I still can't recommend Yoshi Touch and Go.

151
00:08:12,444 --> 00:08:15,605
[SPEAKER_03]: I say, if you want a game like that, just get Kirby Canvas Curse.

152
00:08:15,645 --> 00:08:17,046
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a much more solid game.

153
00:08:17,566 --> 00:08:18,826
[SPEAKER_03]: So really, it's just been about the handhelds.

154
00:08:19,206 --> 00:08:20,107
[SPEAKER_03]: I still need pack picks.

155
00:08:20,851 --> 00:08:21,631
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing I want to bring up.

156
00:08:21,731 --> 00:08:23,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I still need to check out Pack Picks.

157
00:08:23,952 --> 00:08:25,753
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to check out Pack and Roll too when that comes out.

158
00:08:26,373 --> 00:08:27,313
[SPEAKER_03]: Pack and Roll is fun.

159
00:08:27,854 --> 00:08:29,574
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing I want to definitely mention about PSPs.

160
00:08:29,774 --> 00:08:36,717
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to kind of bash the whole UMD movies on PSP thing as not being a very good idea as what's the point.

161
00:08:37,057 --> 00:08:43,381
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll tell you what, after five hour flights on Southwest, PSP movies have become my favorite thing ever.

162
00:08:43,441 --> 00:08:51,025
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so happy that my friend SharksGirl, who's been on some of our three hour programs on OrangeLodgeRadio.com, she loaned me some movies.

163
00:08:51,085 --> 00:08:55,567
[SPEAKER_03]: I finally saw Tron for the first time on PSP and I saw a movie called I, Robot with Will Smith.

164
00:08:56,107 --> 00:08:56,928
[SPEAKER_03]: Both great movies.

165
00:08:57,388 --> 00:09:00,010
[SPEAKER_03]: And I seriously should trademark this idea or something before somebody steals it.

166
00:09:19,745 --> 00:09:21,987
[SPEAKER_03]: and I think I might have mentioned this on a three hour show or something before.

167
00:09:22,027 --> 00:09:25,569
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to say it again because this is very apparent to me after doing a lot of traveling this weekend.

168
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:31,873
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody should start like a rental service for PSP movies in airports.

169
00:09:32,597 --> 00:09:34,559
[SPEAKER_03]: and have these places in all these airports?

170
00:09:34,579 --> 00:09:35,901
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called Altatoons.

171
00:09:36,221 --> 00:09:39,064
[SPEAKER_03]: Do they rent UMDs though?

172
00:09:39,344 --> 00:09:39,885
[SPEAKER_04]: They do?

173
00:09:40,105 --> 00:09:41,527
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they rent and sell DVDs.

174
00:09:41,567 --> 00:09:42,588
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought they only sold them.

175
00:09:42,808 --> 00:09:44,470
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm pretty sure they do.

176
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:47,093
[SPEAKER_04]: I know they are starting to do UMD games also.

177
00:09:47,113 --> 00:09:48,354
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

178
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:50,216
[SPEAKER_04]: I know there's some place that

179
00:09:50,774 --> 00:09:54,095
[SPEAKER_04]: All the tunes I want to say is one of them, but I can't remember if they rent or sell.

180
00:09:54,475 --> 00:09:59,896
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to say they do rent, though, because you can return them to other Ultatoon stores in different airports.

181
00:10:00,396 --> 00:10:03,097
[SPEAKER_03]: See, something like that for UMDs, I bet would make it killing.

182
00:10:03,637 --> 00:10:07,117
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe not right away, but when PSPs really catch on, I think it would be a great idea.

183
00:10:07,538 --> 00:10:10,078
[SPEAKER_04]: They love those portable games, man.

184
00:10:10,478 --> 00:10:16,659
[SPEAKER_03]: If Ultatoon adopts that idea, they need to send me a dollar or something for giving the idea.

185
00:10:16,859 --> 00:10:19,260
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, let's get into some gaming news tonight, boys and girls.

186
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,841
[SPEAKER_03]: Starting off with QuakeCon.

187
00:10:21,902 --> 00:10:25,424
[SPEAKER_03]: QuakeCon just happened recently and I heard that there were some new movies shown for Quake 4.

188
00:10:26,085 --> 00:10:29,067
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't gotten a chance to see this, but apparently the Quake fans are all excited.

189
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:32,971
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody in chat during the live program this week was really excited about Quake 4.

190
00:10:33,011 --> 00:10:33,411
[SPEAKER_04]: I have seen them.

191
00:10:33,611 --> 00:10:34,172
[SPEAKER_03]: What did you think?

192
00:10:34,672 --> 00:10:35,433
[SPEAKER_04]: They were interesting.

193
00:10:36,494 --> 00:10:39,156
[SPEAKER_04]: Quake, though, is starting to look more like Halo.

194
00:10:39,196 --> 00:10:40,817
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I wonder why.

195
00:10:41,938 --> 00:10:42,879
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not surprising.

196
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:45,321
[SPEAKER_04]: It's running on the new Doom 3 engine, which is nice.

197
00:10:47,767 --> 00:10:52,210
[SPEAKER_04]: The movie that I saw looks like an all-out war right now.

198
00:10:52,431 --> 00:10:56,254
[SPEAKER_04]: You're in the trenches with this one guy and you're shooting these other things.

199
00:10:56,274 --> 00:10:58,075
[SPEAKER_04]: You see gunfire going up overhead.

200
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:59,397
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like Halo 2, basically.

201
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:05,923
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

202
00:11:06,063 --> 00:11:06,643
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks good though.

203
00:11:06,843 --> 00:11:10,305
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's what I thought was a really cool piece of information that also came out of QuakeCon.

204
00:11:10,405 --> 00:11:16,327
[SPEAKER_03]: John Carmack actually announced that the Quake 3 source code is going to be released.

205
00:11:17,027 --> 00:11:20,088
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, remember what the Doom source code release has done for us.

206
00:11:20,148 --> 00:11:22,749
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, now we've got like Doom on the iPod and all this crazy stuff.

207
00:11:22,769 --> 00:11:24,129
[SPEAKER_03]: This is going to be pretty cool.

208
00:11:24,249 --> 00:11:25,070
[SPEAKER_03]: Quake 3 source.

209
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:28,131
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just wanting to see what they would turn it into.

210
00:11:28,951 --> 00:11:31,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm kind of curious to see what kind of side projects come out of this.

211
00:11:31,812 --> 00:11:33,693
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, you're kind of more in the hack and crack thing.

212
00:11:33,733 --> 00:11:34,513
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this going to be a huge...

213
00:11:35,475 --> 00:11:36,536
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think about the Quake 3 source?

214
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:52,651
[SPEAKER_04]: Couldn't hurt, definitely.

215
00:11:54,252 --> 00:11:56,393
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about PSP and the firmware.

216
00:11:56,413 --> 00:11:57,754
[SPEAKER_03]: There's brand new firmware coming out.

217
00:11:57,814 --> 00:12:01,716
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually going to come out today, August 15th, the day that our show is released.

218
00:12:02,016 --> 00:12:11,262
[SPEAKER_03]: It was supposed to be out a couple days ago, but they just have to wait a little bit because I guess there were some recent bugs to fix or something.

219
00:12:11,602 --> 00:12:20,327
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a reminder, the PSP firmware 2.0 will have that new web browser application which lets you browse the internet on your PSP from anywhere.

220
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:22,899
[SPEAKER_03]: Wireless Hotspot.

221
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:24,020
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's going to be pretty cool.

222
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,241
[SPEAKER_03]: Also enhanced video and audio playback.

223
00:12:26,261 --> 00:12:33,346
[SPEAKER_03]: They're saying photo sharing options, broader network connectivity, and a more customizable interface.

224
00:12:33,406 --> 00:12:34,727
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of people looking forward to 2.0.

225
00:12:35,148 --> 00:12:40,811
[SPEAKER_03]: But of course, the downside to that, if you upgrade, say goodbye to the NES emulator for a little while.

226
00:12:40,871 --> 00:12:41,552
[SPEAKER_03]: At least until

227
00:12:42,618 --> 00:12:44,760
[SPEAKER_03]: You know they're going to find a way around the 2.0 fix.

228
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:45,801
[SPEAKER_03]: They're working on it already.

229
00:12:45,861 --> 00:12:46,462
[SPEAKER_03]: Give it time.

230
00:12:46,722 --> 00:12:47,402
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure it'll happen.

231
00:12:47,563 --> 00:12:52,066
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly though, if you're going to be upgrading because of a web browser, just wait.

232
00:12:52,227 --> 00:12:53,808
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they're already working on web browsers.

233
00:12:53,848 --> 00:12:54,889
[SPEAKER_04]: Hell, there's four already.

234
00:12:55,329 --> 00:12:55,830
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, what?

235
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:58,592
[SPEAKER_04]: If you really want to use a web browser, there's always Wipeout.

236
00:12:58,972 --> 00:13:00,814
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's already two other ones that they're working on.

237
00:13:00,994 --> 00:13:08,641
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, but when they release a really popular game for PSP, like let's say the new Grand Theft Auto game, don't you think these games are going to force you to go to 2.0?

238
00:13:09,264 --> 00:13:14,166
[SPEAKER_04]: No, because what they'll do is they'll just dump the ISO of the game, and then you'll just be able to run it.

239
00:13:15,066 --> 00:13:19,608
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, heaven forbid there should be people out there in the world that buy their games legally.

240
00:13:20,748 --> 00:13:26,570
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, yes, you can still buy the game legally, but you can use your own software to dump the game and then run it on your memory card.

241
00:13:27,725 --> 00:13:28,005
[SPEAKER_03]: Kid Icarus

242
00:13:54,828 --> 00:13:58,090
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be bringing up a Sony anti-piracy story a little later, which I'm sure you'll love.

243
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:01,491
[SPEAKER_03]: But in the meantime, let's hear what's going on in the hack and crack world.

244
00:14:01,651 --> 00:14:03,432
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, glad you asked.

245
00:14:03,832 --> 00:14:08,434
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we're getting closer and closer to porting Linux to everything.

246
00:14:08,574 --> 00:14:11,475
[SPEAKER_04]: So why not start with the PSP?

247
00:14:11,575 --> 00:14:12,936
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, it's not really ported.

248
00:14:13,216 --> 00:14:14,316
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just emulated.

249
00:14:14,376 --> 00:14:16,737
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have the x86 emulator.

250
00:14:17,058 --> 00:14:20,219
[SPEAKER_04]: And for those not to know, it's basically a PC emulator, you know.

251
00:14:20,728 --> 00:14:21,168
[SPEAKER_04]: x86 is emulated

252
00:14:31,198 --> 00:14:34,820
[SPEAKER_03]: You could run Oregon Trail on your PSP.

253
00:14:55,379 --> 00:14:55,859
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

254
00:14:55,959 --> 00:14:56,339
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just kidding.

255
00:14:56,359 --> 00:14:58,220
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if it did, they have an emulator for that, too.

256
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,100
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to come out.

257
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,422
[SPEAKER_04]: Eventually, you'll be able to play Oregon Trail on the PSP.

258
00:15:02,502 --> 00:15:02,942
[SPEAKER_04]: Hooray!

259
00:15:04,142 --> 00:15:05,703
[SPEAKER_04]: After all, that's what we're working towards, right?

260
00:15:05,723 --> 00:15:06,363
[SPEAKER_04]: That's exactly.

261
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:08,544
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't give a shit about Halo 3.

262
00:15:09,324 --> 00:15:11,185
[SPEAKER_03]: I want Oregon Trail on the PSP.

263
00:15:11,645 --> 00:15:12,685
[SPEAKER_00]: You missed it, though.

264
00:15:12,705 --> 00:15:17,147
[SPEAKER_00]: Our live show two weeks ago, we had my good friend Kasumi19 on the show.

265
00:15:17,787 --> 00:15:20,548
[SPEAKER_00]: By the end of the show, she was playing Oregon Trail on her laptop.

266
00:15:20,808 --> 00:15:21,028
[SPEAKER_04]: See?

267
00:15:21,729 --> 00:15:22,189
[SPEAKER_03]: Smart woman.

268
00:15:22,929 --> 00:15:23,229
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh-huh.

269
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:26,271
[SPEAKER_04]: Other stuff that's going on in the world of the PSP.

270
00:15:27,232 --> 00:15:30,474
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone actually made a home version of Kaboom for the PSP.

271
00:15:30,594 --> 00:15:31,315
[SPEAKER_04]: Rock on.

272
00:15:31,835 --> 00:15:32,315
[SPEAKER_03]: Rock on.

273
00:15:32,355 --> 00:15:34,116
[SPEAKER_03]: Kaboom was like the best Atari 2600 game.

274
00:15:34,156 --> 00:15:34,437
[SPEAKER_03]: So simple.

275
00:15:37,285 --> 00:15:43,446
[SPEAKER_03]: So simple, the concept of the game, but I remember being five years old and just being totally obsessed with Kaboom.

276
00:15:43,506 --> 00:15:44,687
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, don't get too excited yet.

277
00:15:44,807 --> 00:15:45,947
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still got tons of bugs.

278
00:15:45,987 --> 00:15:47,747
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the first game this guy's programmed.

279
00:15:47,787 --> 00:15:51,888
[SPEAKER_04]: It's programmed in a language called Lua, which you can actually program homebrew games.

280
00:15:51,948 --> 00:15:53,369
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty simple for your PSP.

281
00:15:53,529 --> 00:15:56,529
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, plus also the fact that it doesn't have that little dial controller.

282
00:15:56,649 --> 00:16:02,151
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, no other controller works the same as those little dial controllers that you had for Breakout and stuff.

283
00:16:02,731 --> 00:16:03,631
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll ruin it for me.

284
00:16:04,211 --> 00:16:04,351
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

285
00:16:04,955 --> 00:16:16,401
[SPEAKER_04]: so you've got that so that's one thing you can look at the other thing is this operating system or I should say a GUI that they're making called P6 which is going to be able to run homebrew stuff and all that wonderful

286
00:16:17,406 --> 00:16:20,448
[SPEAKER_04]: Plus, they're talking about random wallpapers and yadda yadda yadda.

287
00:16:21,048 --> 00:16:23,369
[SPEAKER_04]: And then my favorite, Scorched Earth.

288
00:16:23,409 --> 00:16:27,811
[SPEAKER_04]: PSP's got a version .9 released right now.

289
00:16:27,871 --> 00:16:29,452
[SPEAKER_04]: They've got more stuff being worked on.

290
00:16:30,132 --> 00:16:31,713
[SPEAKER_04]: A scoring system, that sort of thing.

291
00:16:31,793 --> 00:16:32,893
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's getting closer.

292
00:16:33,454 --> 00:16:34,354
[SPEAKER_04]: Getting closer.

293
00:16:34,374 --> 00:16:36,355
[SPEAKER_03]: With all due respect, fuck worms.

294
00:16:36,415 --> 00:16:37,856
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all about Scorched Earth.

295
00:16:38,896 --> 00:16:40,017
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah.

296
00:16:40,077 --> 00:16:46,640
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, away from the PSP stuff, we've got Scum, which was that wonderful engine that ran Maniac Mansion in

297
00:16:47,492 --> 00:16:51,575
[SPEAKER_04]: My favorite game, Monkey Island, the secret of Monkey Island, came to the DS.

298
00:16:52,056 --> 00:16:53,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect.

299
00:16:53,597 --> 00:16:57,160
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't believe that'd be awesome to try that out on the DS with a touchscreen.

300
00:16:57,781 --> 00:17:12,292
[SPEAKER_04]: It runs fantastic from what I hear, and there's info on that on this nintendo-ds.dcmu.com.uk I know, no one's going to get that, but anyways, it's out there.

301
00:17:12,312 --> 00:17:13,473
[SPEAKER_03]: Rewind, listen again.

302
00:17:13,894 --> 00:17:14,674
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, cool.

303
00:17:15,335 --> 00:17:16,256
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so...

304
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:17,997
[SPEAKER_04]: Really cool stuff.

305
00:17:18,217 --> 00:17:18,638
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool.

306
00:17:18,658 --> 00:17:23,784
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's go to DarkSakura, who's got a story for us about... Well, what is this about, really?

307
00:17:24,471 --> 00:17:35,457
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's put out by BBC News, and I'm glad somebody, especially a prominent source like BBC, has pointed out that parents ignore game age ratings.

308
00:17:35,617 --> 00:17:36,318
[SPEAKER_03]: Surprise!

309
00:17:36,658 --> 00:17:37,358
[SPEAKER_03]: Big surprise.

310
00:17:37,959 --> 00:17:45,243
[SPEAKER_00]: A study commissioned by the UK games industry found that parents let their children play games for adults, even though they know they are 18 rated.

311
00:17:45,723 --> 00:17:48,865
[SPEAKER_00]: To quote Juergen Freund, he's a Modulum researcher,

312
00:17:50,106 --> 00:17:54,209
[SPEAKER_00]: Most parents think that their child is mature enough so that these games will not influence them.

313
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:58,733
[SPEAKER_00]: Parents perceive age ratings as a guide but not as a definite prohibition.

314
00:17:59,774 --> 00:18:07,962
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a case where when the parents of a 14-year-old blamed the game Manhunt for his death.

315
00:18:09,123 --> 00:18:13,487
[SPEAKER_00]: And the police investigated it and dismissed it as part of the case.

316
00:18:13,567 --> 00:18:15,229
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I'm fine with a parent...

317
00:18:15,609 --> 00:18:16,530
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

318
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:49,152
[SPEAKER_03]: Careless parents with careless children that screwed up for everybody else.

319
00:18:50,433 --> 00:18:55,515
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a notice on here that between January 2003 and July 2004, 16 out of the 1,208 games on sale in the UK were given an 18-plus certificate.

320
00:18:55,595 --> 00:18:57,476
[SPEAKER_00]: How well did those 16 games sell, though, I wonder?

321
00:19:05,111 --> 00:19:14,680
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they actually interviewed about a thousand UK adults and a further 100 were questioned after buying a video game that was for 18 up.

322
00:19:16,081 --> 00:19:20,605
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, a comment from a couple of the people, because they allow you to give comments back on this.

323
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:25,489
[SPEAKER_00]: To allow an underage child to play an 18 plus rated game is irresponsible parenting.

324
00:19:30,222 --> 00:19:30,902
[SPEAKER_03]: I disagree.

325
00:19:32,003 --> 00:19:37,444
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet the same person would take their child to an R-rated movie if they screened it first, or if they knew something about it.

326
00:19:37,824 --> 00:19:52,028
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think if a parent knows a little something about the game, although of course this story talks about ignoring ratings, but I think if the parent knows that their child can differentiate between violence in a video game and violence in the real world, I think that's a parent's decision.

327
00:19:53,621 --> 00:20:00,050
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also another one on here that says, often media hype builds games up to be worse than they are.

328
00:20:01,021 --> 00:20:01,822
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you!

329
00:20:02,302 --> 00:20:03,223
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, hello.

330
00:20:03,763 --> 00:20:04,284
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.

331
00:20:05,585 --> 00:20:13,792
[SPEAKER_03]: I think back to, remember we read a story a couple weeks ago on air about the blind guy who was playing games and kicking people's ass in Soul Calibur 2?

332
00:20:14,473 --> 00:20:20,418
[SPEAKER_03]: And the media said that he'd play Soul Calibur 2 and decapitate people in the game, which is not something you do in that game.

333
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:23,481
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I want to go ahead and read his quote in full, if I may.

334
00:20:23,661 --> 00:20:23,841
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

335
00:20:24,582 --> 00:20:25,963
[SPEAKER_00]: The guy's name is Kenny's from Nottingham.

336
00:20:26,823 --> 00:20:29,825
[SPEAKER_00]: The violence in video games is often of a cartoon nature.

337
00:20:30,225 --> 00:20:37,308
[SPEAKER_00]: The outcry over Manhunt was laughable because the game was rubbish and wouldn't have sold at all but for the furor in the press.

338
00:20:38,168 --> 00:20:44,491
[SPEAKER_00]: Often media hype builds games up to be worse than they are, and by doing so makes them a must-have game that they do not deserve to be.

339
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:51,034
[SPEAKER_00]: Grand Theft Auto San Andreas is no different in theme to its two predecessors, but its notoriety ensured its success.

340
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:52,910
[SPEAKER_02]: Very interesting.

341
00:20:53,151 --> 00:20:53,811
[SPEAKER_04]: I have something.

342
00:20:54,271 --> 00:20:55,372
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, Loki, you have something to add?

343
00:20:55,392 --> 00:20:57,013
[SPEAKER_04]: I have something to add to this.

344
00:20:57,254 --> 00:20:59,275
[SPEAKER_04]: There's also kind of a related story.

345
00:21:00,456 --> 00:21:08,602
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a study done in the University of Illinois, and they found no strong link between violent video games and aggression.

346
00:21:09,522 --> 00:21:20,290
[SPEAKER_04]: They basically did a survey watching players play this game, Astro's Call 2, a popular MMORPG, and basically saying that the results were that

347
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:21,837
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

348
00:21:51,491 --> 00:21:56,593
[SPEAKER_04]: All these age prevention things for mature games, it's all programmed into the consoles.

349
00:21:56,633 --> 00:21:58,773
[SPEAKER_04]: You can lock out content.

350
00:21:58,793 --> 00:22:00,234
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have a code to get into it.

351
00:22:00,374 --> 00:22:02,274
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you can lock this stuff out for your kids.

352
00:22:02,294 --> 00:22:09,756
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're worried about your kids playing games because you're not supervising them, which you should be doing in the first place, you can lock this stuff out.

353
00:22:10,136 --> 00:22:15,198
[SPEAKER_04]: It's on every single console system, I think from the PlayStation up through the PSP now.

354
00:22:15,882 --> 00:22:18,084
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just... It's ridiculous.

355
00:22:18,104 --> 00:22:18,464
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

356
00:22:18,644 --> 00:22:29,393
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also one parent who replied on this one that talks about how the kids are swapping games with each other too and so they even don't have any control over that because their kids are taking the initiative.

357
00:22:29,413 --> 00:22:31,515
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a very interesting point but at the same time...

358
00:22:32,028 --> 00:22:35,869
[SPEAKER_03]: The parents should still be aware of what games their kids are playing.

359
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:40,650
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another comment on here, just the last one I'm going to read, by Vicky in Glasgow.

360
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:47,111
[SPEAKER_00]: She says, I definitely agree with the idea that an 18-plus certificate on a game makes it more desirable.

361
00:22:47,771 --> 00:22:53,272
[SPEAKER_00]: My stepson is instantly drawn to the game that he is not allowed to play, and it is a problem amongst his peers.

362
00:22:53,812 --> 00:23:01,734
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, it makes an even greater problem when they are allowed to play these games at friends' houses with the blessing of friends' parents, but without our knowledge or consent.

363
00:23:02,296 --> 00:23:03,617
[SPEAKER_03]: Very interesting point there.

364
00:23:03,777 --> 00:23:04,437
[SPEAKER_00]: Kids are sneaky.

365
00:23:04,878 --> 00:23:09,260
[SPEAKER_03]: Very interesting point as well that the mature rating makes us want to play the games more.

366
00:23:10,841 --> 00:23:13,242
[SPEAKER_03]: Think about would anybody have ever bought the guy game?

367
00:23:13,983 --> 00:23:14,443
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously.

368
00:23:15,503 --> 00:23:16,704
[SPEAKER_04]: They call it the sweet 18 in Europe.

369
00:23:16,744 --> 00:23:18,285
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, 18 plus games sell better.

370
00:23:18,305 --> 00:23:18,505
[SPEAKER_04]: 18 sweet.

371
00:23:18,525 --> 00:23:18,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Sweet.

372
00:23:26,482 --> 00:23:27,044
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's move on.

373
00:23:27,084 --> 00:23:29,310
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to mention something going on in another MMO.

374
00:23:29,651 --> 00:23:32,118
[SPEAKER_03]: Asheron's Call 2 got brought up in that previous story.

375
00:23:32,499 --> 00:23:33,923
[SPEAKER_03]: EverQuest 2, I want to mention this.

376
00:23:34,602 --> 00:23:46,046
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently there was a big group of hackers that illegally created currency in EverQuest 2 and ended up causing the game's economy to suffer by 20% in just 24 hours.

377
00:23:46,146 --> 00:23:47,907
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, then they finally got caught.

378
00:23:48,667 --> 00:23:58,130
[SPEAKER_03]: Chris Kramer, the director of public relations for EverQuest 2, said that they had a duping bug that made large quantities of platinum the game's currency.

379
00:23:59,231 --> 00:24:01,951
[SPEAKER_03]: The amount of money in the game was increased by a fifth in about 24 hours.

380
00:24:01,971 --> 00:24:02,031
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

381
00:24:03,885 --> 00:24:04,586
[SPEAKER_03]: Very interesting.

382
00:24:05,867 --> 00:24:08,470
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's that.

383
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:18,299
[SPEAKER_03]: EverQuest 2 is not a game that I've really played a whole lot, but I guess if you do play that game, that must have sucked to have that happen.

384
00:24:18,319 --> 00:24:22,804
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of strange thinking of a virtual environment as having its own economy.

385
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:24,602
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, I know.

386
00:24:24,782 --> 00:24:28,209
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when you stop and just think about that, it's like, oh my god.

387
00:24:28,229 --> 00:24:31,495
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's a huge part of any MMO.

388
00:24:31,535 --> 00:24:35,503
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow has its economy, Final Fantasy Labyrinth, any of them.

389
00:24:36,623 --> 00:24:40,245
[SPEAKER_00]: But actually, PSO, though, really doesn't.

390
00:24:41,726 --> 00:24:43,187
[SPEAKER_03]: Because there's no auction house in PSO.

391
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:44,127
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.

392
00:24:44,708 --> 00:24:54,673
[SPEAKER_00]: You have game-controlled shops, and basically the only way to really... Players can sell stuff to each other, but that's really the only way to do it.

393
00:24:54,693 --> 00:24:57,975
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more of a barter system, and so there's no real economy to manipulate there.

394
00:24:59,596 --> 00:25:01,857
[SPEAKER_04]: I prefer that, actually, over the auction house thing.

395
00:25:02,536 --> 00:25:09,459
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, they did limit the total amount of currency you can hold in Blue Burst compared to the Xbox.

396
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:20,224
[SPEAKER_03]: Just an FYI, because I don't want to get any hate mail over this, the economy of the game was brought back to normal after the thing was discovered, so if you're an EverQuest 2 player, everything's A-OK.

397
00:25:20,264 --> 00:25:21,804
[SPEAKER_03]: You can go back to your EverQuesting now.

398
00:25:21,924 --> 00:25:23,445
[SPEAKER_00]: Enjoy your crack and your Slash Pizza.

399
00:25:23,525 --> 00:25:25,366
[SPEAKER_03]: Enjoy your EverCrack and your Slash Pizza.

400
00:25:26,761 --> 00:25:27,822
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope I don't mispronounce this.

401
00:25:27,862 --> 00:25:28,122
[SPEAKER_03]: Yannick?

402
00:25:49,730 --> 00:26:02,479
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, regarding the media player that Loki mentioned on the last podcast, I have purchased the original media player back when I first got my PlayStation 2, and didn't really know what to expect since it came from Mad Catz, and I have a bad history with them.

403
00:26:02,879 --> 00:26:11,605
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this product is very reliable if your computer is fast enough to stream the video over to your PS2, and if the video is at the 320x240 resolution.

404
00:26:12,105 --> 00:26:17,909
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically going over this saying that Java stuff's buggy, but the Mad Catz one worked just fine.

405
00:26:19,562 --> 00:26:19,962
[SPEAKER_04]: Alrighty.

406
00:26:20,243 --> 00:26:23,645
[SPEAKER_04]: The one I was talking about, though, it's a little different than the media player he was talking about.

407
00:26:23,685 --> 00:26:28,068
[SPEAKER_04]: The one I talked about was actually streaming stuff off the PlayStation hard drive that you put in there.

408
00:26:28,509 --> 00:26:30,950
[SPEAKER_04]: So, similar, but I think you can do the same type of thing.

409
00:26:33,252 --> 00:26:35,234
[SPEAKER_03]: Any other emails you want to share?

410
00:26:35,254 --> 00:26:43,500
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we also got one from someone named Blake, who writes us from Atlanta, Georgia.

411
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,181
[SPEAKER_00]: Hotlanta!

412
00:26:46,337 --> 00:26:48,198
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I've been to Atlanta plenty of times.

413
00:26:48,258 --> 00:26:51,319
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to stay with relatives over in Alpharetta.

414
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:53,861
[SPEAKER_00]: I got cousins in Augusta.

415
00:26:54,421 --> 00:26:55,721
[SPEAKER_00]: Although that's a bit of a drive from there.

416
00:26:57,562 --> 00:27:00,043
[SPEAKER_00]: You just started listening to our show a few weeks ago.

417
00:27:00,144 --> 00:27:00,684
[SPEAKER_00]: Great job.

418
00:27:01,084 --> 00:27:02,965
[SPEAKER_00]: You're one of the two podcasts I listen to.

419
00:27:04,061 --> 00:27:05,401
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the other one?

420
00:27:05,721 --> 00:27:06,302
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm just kidding.

421
00:27:06,702 --> 00:27:07,702
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm quoting.

422
00:27:07,962 --> 00:27:11,223
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, anyways, listen to your latest show when you were ranting about the game ratings.

423
00:27:11,283 --> 00:27:12,483
[SPEAKER_00]: I completely agree with you guys.

424
00:27:12,623 --> 00:27:14,883
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm 13 and my parents let me play any game I want.

425
00:27:15,423 --> 00:27:21,405
[SPEAKER_00]: Back when I was around 3 years old, my dad talked to me about game ratings and told me it was all fake and just a game.

426
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:24,425
[SPEAKER_00]: Been playing Doom since I was 2, literally.

427
00:27:24,965 --> 00:27:27,946
[SPEAKER_00]: The only games they don't let me play are the ones with nudity and sex.

428
00:27:28,186 --> 00:27:32,427
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm stuck playing my God of War demo for PS2 since I can't get God of War due to the threesome.

429
00:27:33,027 --> 00:27:35,188
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily, the GTA games never appealed to me.

430
00:27:35,268 --> 00:27:42,352
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you guys should talk more about the money since there's a lot of news coming up lately and I'm a huge fan of DDR and every other music game ever created.

431
00:27:42,813 --> 00:27:46,595
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that you should go to the PTA meetings and tell parents they aren't doing their jobs.

432
00:27:48,361 --> 00:27:49,422
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we talked about last week.

433
00:27:49,442 --> 00:27:49,842
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.

434
00:27:49,882 --> 00:27:50,322
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.

435
00:27:51,142 --> 00:27:54,624
[SPEAKER_00]: We said we were going to march up on the PTA meetings and say, hey!

436
00:27:54,824 --> 00:28:01,006
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really interesting about the fact that the dad had to talk with him when he was really young, and that's good.

437
00:28:01,467 --> 00:28:06,769
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know what else is really good about that is that, you know, how would the parents know the God of War has a threesome?

438
00:28:06,809 --> 00:28:09,410
[SPEAKER_03]: What's to stop this kid from going out and getting the game?

439
00:28:10,183 --> 00:28:12,606
[SPEAKER_03]: and just saying, oh, that means the parents did their work.

440
00:28:12,927 --> 00:28:13,407
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.

441
00:28:13,688 --> 00:28:19,034
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Blake, tell your parents that they are doing a fabulous job and they get the DarkSakura seal of approval.

442
00:28:19,154 --> 00:28:19,655
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

443
00:28:19,995 --> 00:28:22,538
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think Blake sounds mature enough where he can handle little boobs.

444
00:28:22,599 --> 00:28:23,219
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just boobs.

445
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,561
[SPEAKER_03]: They're pixelated boobs.

446
00:28:24,601 --> 00:28:25,362
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, come on, they're fake.

447
00:28:25,482 --> 00:28:26,003
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just boobs.

448
00:28:28,185 --> 00:28:35,027
[SPEAKER_00]: I really need to point out this family as a prime example of doing it the right way.

449
00:28:35,347 --> 00:28:41,169
[SPEAKER_00]: And on top of that, most kids are smart enough that they know the difference between what's real and what's not.

450
00:28:41,789 --> 00:28:44,890
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a polygon representation of boobs.

451
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:47,150
[SPEAKER_00]: They aren't really fleshy boobs.

452
00:28:47,731 --> 00:28:48,851
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to wait a few years for that.

453
00:28:50,251 --> 00:28:51,892
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have another email you want to read, DarkSakura?

454
00:28:52,543 --> 00:28:53,204
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I have one.

455
00:28:53,304 --> 00:28:54,845
[SPEAKER_03]: I have one I definitely want to throw in here.

456
00:28:55,586 --> 00:28:57,007
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody sent an email.

457
00:28:57,288 --> 00:29:06,576
[SPEAKER_03]: Noah is the name, or N for short, and was mentioning that I'm getting back into Final Fantasy XI at some point and was inviting me to come play on the fairy server with them.

458
00:29:07,857 --> 00:29:13,383
[SPEAKER_03]: I know because I used to make jokes about the fairy server on the three-hour show.

459
00:29:13,463 --> 00:29:14,784
[SPEAKER_03]: The fairy server.

460
00:29:15,264 --> 00:29:16,486
[SPEAKER_03]: It has nothing to do with you.

461
00:29:17,166 --> 00:29:18,527
[SPEAKER_03]: A kind person who wrote this email.

462
00:29:18,607 --> 00:29:21,129
[SPEAKER_03]: It goes back to this whole LiveJournal drama thing.

463
00:29:21,349 --> 00:29:22,130
[SPEAKER_03]: RPG goddess.

464
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:26,133
[SPEAKER_03]: People who roleplay on Final Fantasy XI.

465
00:29:27,874 --> 00:29:28,174
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

466
00:29:28,194 --> 00:29:28,875
[SPEAKER_03]: I take that back.

467
00:29:29,115 --> 00:29:33,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Not that there's anything wrong with roleplaying on Final Fantasy XI, but people who take it a little bit too far.

468
00:29:33,778 --> 00:29:34,539
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is wrong.

469
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:38,842
[SPEAKER_03]: There's nothing wrong as long as you know the difference between reality and Final Fantasy XI.

470
00:29:40,123 --> 00:29:40,583
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

471
00:29:40,703 --> 00:29:40,964
[SPEAKER_03]: I would...

472
00:29:41,704 --> 00:29:48,690
[SPEAKER_03]: And this person says that they've been playing since the US PlayStation 2 release and they're a level 22 slash 11 warrior monk.

473
00:29:48,931 --> 00:29:55,376
[SPEAKER_03]: And they got in there and this person's inviting me because they don't seem to know a whole lot of people that actually play the game as well.

474
00:29:56,437 --> 00:29:57,598
[SPEAKER_03]: I totally appreciate the invite.

475
00:29:57,638 --> 00:29:57,939
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.

476
00:29:57,959 --> 00:30:05,225
[SPEAKER_03]: And I actually had a character on the Ferry server for a little while because there's a large contingent on there that I like playing the games with.

477
00:30:05,706 --> 00:30:05,806
[SPEAKER_03]: And...

478
00:30:06,621 --> 00:30:07,162
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

479
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:31,324
[SPEAKER_03]: So I really appreciate the invite, but if I go back to the game, I'm going to have to go back to my family at Bismarck.

480
00:30:31,584 --> 00:30:37,148
[SPEAKER_03]: However, if you would like to come on over to the Bismarck server with us, that's assuming if I even get back into the game in the first place.

481
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:38,269
[SPEAKER_03]: I still haven't decided on that.

482
00:30:38,869 --> 00:30:43,073
[SPEAKER_03]: Send me an email, rob at orangelaundry.com, and I'll get you a world pass onto Bismarck.

483
00:30:43,793 --> 00:30:49,437
[SPEAKER_03]: And plus, you can still add me to your play online list, and we can send messages back and forth and talk about how the economy on our servers suck.

484
00:30:49,758 --> 00:30:51,199
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you for the invite.

485
00:30:51,219 --> 00:30:52,800
[SPEAKER_00]: I uninstalled play online.

486
00:30:53,481 --> 00:30:53,981
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you did.

487
00:30:54,505 --> 00:30:54,605
[SPEAKER_03]: P.S.

488
00:30:54,645 --> 00:30:54,745
[SPEAKER_03]: Opium

489
00:31:19,898 --> 00:31:20,979
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for writing us.

490
00:31:21,099 --> 00:31:22,060
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I appreciate the email.

491
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:26,424
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, you have a story about the DS and it's going to get cheaper soon, right?

492
00:31:26,524 --> 00:31:26,704
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

493
00:31:27,004 --> 00:31:29,186
[SPEAKER_04]: What's going on with that?

494
00:31:29,226 --> 00:31:30,887
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be dropping by $20 to $130.

495
00:31:31,388 --> 00:31:34,290
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're saying around August 21st is when that's going to happen.

496
00:31:34,811 --> 00:31:38,034
[SPEAKER_04]: And the other thing is, well, what's Sony going to do then?

497
00:31:38,214 --> 00:31:42,397
[SPEAKER_04]: They're thinking about... Because I know the PlayStation 2 is dropping down to $99 pretty soon.

498
00:31:43,238 --> 00:31:43,538
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

499
00:31:44,079 --> 00:31:45,460
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're hoping...

500
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:50,913
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to steal some of Xbox 360's thunder, right?

501
00:31:51,474 --> 00:31:53,235
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think so.

502
00:31:53,715 --> 00:31:55,036
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, that's going to be happening.

503
00:31:55,717 --> 00:31:59,799
[SPEAKER_04]: But hey, cheaper DS, Nintendogs, that's not a bad combo.

504
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:00,520
[SPEAKER_04]: Puppies!

505
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:01,801
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they're kind of smart.

506
00:32:01,841 --> 00:32:03,662
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they're really pushing this Nintendogs thing.

507
00:32:03,702 --> 00:32:08,165
[SPEAKER_03]: I know we have not shut up about this game on the show for several weeks, but there's a reason for that, guys.

508
00:32:08,225 --> 00:32:08,605
[SPEAKER_03]: This game is...

509
00:32:11,622 --> 00:32:12,623
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the next Pokemon.

510
00:32:12,843 --> 00:32:14,144
[SPEAKER_04]: Next Pokemon, I tell ya.

511
00:32:14,544 --> 00:32:15,025
[SPEAKER_04]: I think so too.

512
00:32:15,225 --> 00:32:17,066
[SPEAKER_04]: And wait till the commercials come.

513
00:32:17,267 --> 00:32:24,212
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait till the commercials come and the little puppies come up on the screen and the little girls are, Daddy, Daddy, I want that game!

514
00:32:24,272 --> 00:32:25,473
[SPEAKER_04]: I want the puppy game!

515
00:32:25,513 --> 00:32:26,193
[SPEAKER_04]: Puppy game!

516
00:32:26,474 --> 00:32:27,554
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright.

517
00:32:27,575 --> 00:32:29,136
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for blasting our speakers, everybody.

518
00:32:31,337 --> 00:32:33,079
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you loading up the Nintendogs demo right now?

519
00:32:33,139 --> 00:32:34,460
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm putting in the puppies.

520
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,501
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let me do another Nintendo story where you're loading that up.

521
00:32:38,803 --> 00:32:39,724
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I can barely hear it.

522
00:32:43,615 --> 00:32:44,856
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think they heard that at home.

523
00:32:44,896 --> 00:32:45,776
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe a little bit.

524
00:32:46,517 --> 00:32:53,942
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, Nintendo is actually needing some help trying to get their new Wi-Fi network up in place.

525
00:32:54,483 --> 00:32:57,945
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically what it is, is they're asking that folks do a short little test.

526
00:32:58,265 --> 00:33:03,649
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a simple survey and a download on Nintendo.com.

527
00:33:03,669 --> 00:33:11,535
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically what happens is that it's going to ask for information on your internet connection and all the download does is it just pings Nintendo's servers.

528
00:33:12,155 --> 00:33:18,098
[SPEAKER_03]: and to kind of entice you to do it, it doubles as a Animal Crossing themed desktop clock.

529
00:33:18,518 --> 00:33:19,878
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, a little cute thing there.

530
00:33:20,198 --> 00:33:20,719
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool.

531
00:33:20,899 --> 00:33:36,925
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and basically what they're saying here on Nintendo's website, it says, by gathering information on which types of networking equipment our customers are using and how they have their home network set up, we'll be able to tailor the Nintendo Wi-Fi connection to be easy to use and available to the broadest audience possible.

532
00:33:37,603 --> 00:34:05,915
[SPEAKER_03]: well that's awfully considerate of them also the FAQ also says by the end of 2005 Nintendo DS owners will be able to play via Wi-Fi Mario Kart DS and Animal Crossing DS so if you want to help Nintendo out you want to help those guys out head on over to Nintendo.com and download the Animal Crossing desktop I forgot to mention coming in this fall when they do the price drop they're going to be offering a Nintendo DS package where you can get the DS plus Metro Prime Hunters not the demo

533
00:34:06,967 --> 00:34:09,229
[SPEAKER_04]: Metro Prime Hunters for $150.

534
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:12,212
[SPEAKER_03]: Any more colors?

535
00:34:12,332 --> 00:34:13,813
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm surprised we haven't really heard any.

536
00:34:14,994 --> 00:34:16,695
[SPEAKER_04]: No, just that blue and red.

537
00:34:16,755 --> 00:34:17,656
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that was it.

538
00:34:17,816 --> 00:34:21,199
[SPEAKER_03]: I want the graphite one because the graphite one is cool.

539
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,201
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kind of surprised.

540
00:34:23,241 --> 00:34:25,262
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm surprised that we're even getting excited about colors.

541
00:34:25,342 --> 00:34:26,503
[SPEAKER_03]: There will be more colors.

542
00:34:26,584 --> 00:34:27,104
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't worry.

543
00:34:27,624 --> 00:34:28,685
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's the clear one?

544
00:34:28,745 --> 00:34:29,806
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'm surprised about.

545
00:34:29,846 --> 00:34:32,669
[SPEAKER_03]: All those first advanced, the Game Boy Advance, remember the old one?

546
00:34:32,689 --> 00:34:33,669
[SPEAKER_03]: They were all clear.

547
00:34:33,689 --> 00:34:34,790
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

548
00:34:35,391 --> 00:34:35,611
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

549
00:34:35,919 --> 00:34:36,279
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura.com

550
00:34:55,294 --> 00:35:12,985
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright kids, you know what we gotta do now at this point is that we need DarkSakura to give you guys a little piece of her mind in the formative advice column because if we talked about video games all the time on this show, we would have no time to go around and find out the dark lives of strippers.

551
00:35:13,306 --> 00:35:16,307
[SPEAKER_03]: And those of you guys that listen to the three hour show know exactly what we're talking about.

552
00:35:16,528 --> 00:35:17,728
[SPEAKER_00]: The dark side is bleach.

553
00:35:18,189 --> 00:35:21,831
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you don't know what we're talking about, you should start listening.

554
00:35:22,682 --> 00:35:25,103
[SPEAKER_03]: Sunday nights, 6.30, 9.30 Pacific Standard Time.

555
00:35:25,523 --> 00:35:29,325
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, DarkSakura, what are you going to talk to us about on this podcast?

556
00:35:30,245 --> 00:35:33,267
[SPEAKER_00]: Today's bit of advice is how to deal with a stalker.

557
00:35:33,647 --> 00:35:37,308
[SPEAKER_00]: This is dedicated to my stalker, BlairIsKing on DDR Free.

558
00:35:38,109 --> 00:35:38,589
[SPEAKER_03]: Bravo.

559
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:45,212
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one, firmly inform the stalker that if the unwanted behavior persists, you will take action.

560
00:35:45,856 --> 00:35:51,739
[SPEAKER_00]: Threaten to contact authorities or be a larger, stronger friend or relative.

561
00:35:52,159 --> 00:35:53,319
[SPEAKER_00]: Be prepared to do so.

562
00:35:53,780 --> 00:36:01,984
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not give in to any threats and be ready to secure a restraining order or civil protection order if it becomes necessary for your peace of mind.

563
00:36:02,504 --> 00:36:05,025
[SPEAKER_00]: Inform your family, friends, and co-workers of the situation.

564
00:36:06,346 --> 00:36:07,086
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep a paper trail.

565
00:36:08,035 --> 00:36:10,817
[SPEAKER_00]: Save any relevant letters, notes, emails, and voicemails.

566
00:36:11,217 --> 00:36:16,701
[SPEAKER_00]: Maintain a log or diary of your stalker's actions and report any unlawful behavior to the police immediately.

567
00:36:17,221 --> 00:36:21,263
[SPEAKER_00]: Report phone calls to both the phone company and the police.

568
00:36:21,684 --> 00:36:22,504
[SPEAKER_00]: Inform authorities.

569
00:36:22,924 --> 00:36:26,106
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not let fear of retribution stop you from taking action.

570
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:27,768
[SPEAKER_00]: Take legal action immediately.

571
00:36:28,368 --> 00:36:29,889
[SPEAKER_00]: But my final piece of advice?

572
00:36:30,529 --> 00:36:31,230
[SPEAKER_03]: No means no?

573
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:33,091
[SPEAKER_00]: Piss off!

574
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:39,473
[SPEAKER_00]: Megaman Battle Network 6 How much cooler is that name?

575
00:36:58,273 --> 00:36:58,613
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

576
00:36:59,414 --> 00:36:59,894
[SPEAKER_03]: But they are.

577
00:36:59,994 --> 00:37:01,655
[SPEAKER_03]: Capcom, this is one reason I bring it up.

578
00:37:01,695 --> 00:37:05,176
[SPEAKER_03]: Capcom is saying that Battle Network 6 will be the series climax.

579
00:37:05,757 --> 00:37:08,478
[SPEAKER_03]: Possibly suggesting that it will be the last.

580
00:37:08,938 --> 00:37:14,120
[SPEAKER_04]: Good, then they can get back to making more Mega Man Legend games.

581
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,561
[SPEAKER_04]: Because those games rock.

582
00:37:15,901 --> 00:37:17,882
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, Legends is coming to the PSP.

583
00:37:18,742 --> 00:37:21,584
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want more Mega Man X. I forgot about that.

584
00:37:21,624 --> 00:37:22,504
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm totally going to have to get that.

585
00:37:22,564 --> 00:37:23,565
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want it all 2D.

586
00:37:25,308 --> 00:37:31,933
[SPEAKER_03]: Also in the world of Captain Obvious Presents, Zelda will be made for the revolution.

587
00:37:32,013 --> 00:37:33,214
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, come on, duh.

588
00:37:34,375 --> 00:37:37,397
[SPEAKER_03]: And in other news, there will be a Mario game for the revolution.

589
00:37:37,577 --> 00:37:38,598
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's not official.

590
00:37:38,758 --> 00:37:40,939
[SPEAKER_00]: And there will probably be a Donkey Kong game.

591
00:37:40,959 --> 00:37:41,560
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not official.

592
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:43,061
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop spreading rumors.

593
00:37:43,281 --> 00:37:44,022
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop spreading rumors.

594
00:37:45,383 --> 00:37:47,284
[SPEAKER_03]: Metroid will make its way to the revolution.

595
00:37:47,304 --> 00:37:48,645
[SPEAKER_00]: And another Banjo-Kazooie.

596
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:51,488
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the official news, kids.

597
00:37:52,529 --> 00:38:01,676
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is mentioned in an interview with game designer Ije Anuma in Club Nintendo, the company's official magazine in Latin America.

598
00:38:02,297 --> 00:38:08,542
[SPEAKER_03]: About Zelda on Revolution, Mr. Owada has assigned me with the task of doing a Zelda game for the upcoming platform.

599
00:38:09,423 --> 00:38:10,824
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is our Duh!

600
00:38:11,044 --> 00:38:11,625
[SPEAKER_03]: News of the Week.

601
00:38:15,267 --> 00:38:19,569
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, what's going on overseas for our friends in the UK?

602
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:28,454
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first of all, Electronic Arts is going to be bringing out Everybody Loves, or I'm sorry, We Love Katamari.

603
00:38:28,614 --> 00:38:30,455
[SPEAKER_03]: You were about to say Everybody Loves Katamari.

604
00:38:30,475 --> 00:38:32,576
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I was thinking Mina Daisuke Katamari.

605
00:38:32,596 --> 00:38:33,376
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay, that's fine.

606
00:38:33,837 --> 00:38:36,318
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's how I came to think of it.

607
00:38:36,998 --> 00:38:38,839
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Electronic Arts is going to be publishing that.

608
00:38:38,879 --> 00:38:42,061
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't actually see anything about the first Katamari Damacy, though.

609
00:38:42,904 --> 00:38:44,865
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't they finally get it, but like way later?

610
00:38:44,965 --> 00:38:46,665
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, yeah, way later.

611
00:38:46,745 --> 00:38:54,168
[SPEAKER_00]: But at any rate, it's going to be by EA instead of Namco, which Namco is bringing out our version next month.

612
00:38:54,188 --> 00:38:54,949
[SPEAKER_03]: Hooray!

613
00:38:56,429 --> 00:38:59,390
[SPEAKER_03]: But now, EA typically does this for Namco.

614
00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:01,711
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of their games that they have done overseas.

615
00:39:02,311 --> 00:39:06,433
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is just good news for our buddies in the UK that they will see this game sooner rather than later.

616
00:39:07,108 --> 00:39:10,990
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's a funny little parody picture that says, We love Katamari Street.

617
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:14,631
[SPEAKER_00]: But with a big EA Games logo on it.

618
00:39:15,171 --> 00:39:19,373
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully that won't be the game coming out in the UK.

619
00:39:19,453 --> 00:39:33,699
[SPEAKER_00]: I love, though, if ever you look on the Japanese cover, and there's big scans of it online, all the Namco employees out in front of it, but if you look in the windows, reflected on the windows is the King of All Cosmos taking the picture.

620
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:35,161
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's cool.

621
00:39:35,501 --> 00:39:40,046
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I didn't get a chance to say this since I wasn't here last week, but I hate the American box art.

622
00:39:40,407 --> 00:39:40,927
[SPEAKER_03]: It's awful.

623
00:39:41,268 --> 00:39:42,229
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't seen it, actually.

624
00:39:42,389 --> 00:39:44,772
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of hidden in that parody graphic.

625
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:45,633
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of hidden.

626
00:39:45,893 --> 00:39:47,615
[SPEAKER_03]: It's awful.

627
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:52,040
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope it was just a mock-up done by some game company, because I did not care for the box art at all.

628
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,482
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen the box art.

629
00:39:53,642 --> 00:39:53,762
[SPEAKER_04]: It's...

630
00:39:54,261 --> 00:39:54,721
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

631
00:40:12,985 --> 00:40:14,846
[SPEAKER_03]: Any more UK news, DarkSakura?

632
00:40:14,986 --> 00:40:24,471
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the game premiered on Yahoo UK and Ireland video games is The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe for PS2.

633
00:40:26,372 --> 00:40:30,534
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually still in production, but the review of it is just...

634
00:40:31,457 --> 00:40:32,297
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for watching!

635
00:40:53,084 --> 00:40:53,964
[SPEAKER_00]: at the end, I guess.

636
00:40:54,184 --> 00:40:58,426
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, you were telling me at some point that you had actually gotten to play this game, somehow, at E3?

637
00:40:58,466 --> 00:41:00,847
[SPEAKER_04]: Briefly, like five minutes worth.

638
00:41:01,767 --> 00:41:14,492
[SPEAKER_04]: It looked very interesting, and it reminded me very much of the Lord of the Rings game, just the way that it was, because it was kind of that isometric, top-down type of thing, and it looked pretty good.

639
00:41:14,712 --> 00:41:15,833
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it looked good.

640
00:41:16,013 --> 00:41:19,414
[SPEAKER_04]: I honestly don't remember much of the language in the wardrobe.

641
00:41:19,454 --> 00:41:22,255
[SPEAKER_04]: I read all the books, like, way back in elementary school, but...

642
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:24,410
[SPEAKER_04]: Call of Cthulhu.

643
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:25,011
[SPEAKER_04]: The official site is up.

644
00:41:25,031 --> 00:41:25,471
[SPEAKER_04]: CallofCthulhu.com

645
00:41:40,438 --> 00:41:41,098
[SPEAKER_03]: Coming out in September.

646
00:41:41,118 --> 00:41:42,719
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say, isn't that game coming out very soon?

647
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:44,760
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty soon.

648
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:51,742
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I've been gushing about the game, but you can go to CallOfCthulhu.com to check out the official art.

649
00:41:52,723 --> 00:41:55,104
[SPEAKER_00]: Background on the Cthulhu myth.

650
00:41:55,284 --> 00:41:56,404
[SPEAKER_00]: There's downloads on there.

651
00:41:56,424 --> 00:41:56,964
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great site.

652
00:41:57,925 --> 00:41:58,205
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

653
00:41:59,707 --> 00:42:00,107
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else?

654
00:42:00,987 --> 00:42:01,647
[SPEAKER_00]: One last thing.

655
00:42:01,707 --> 00:42:02,448
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

656
00:42:02,508 --> 00:42:14,110
[SPEAKER_00]: Not necessarily specifically related to the UK, but Koei, who was one of my favorite games ever, Keio Yugekitai, Keio Flying Squadron, back on the Sega CD.

657
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:17,691
[SPEAKER_03]: And I remember them for Romance in Three Kingdoms.

658
00:42:18,571 --> 00:42:19,791
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobunaga's Ambition, that's it.

659
00:42:20,791 --> 00:42:23,412
[SPEAKER_00]: They were at Tokyo Game Show and announced their lineup.

660
00:42:24,231 --> 00:42:28,913
[SPEAKER_00]: and to quote my source, let's just say we hope you like Dynasty Warriors.

661
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:36,656
[SPEAKER_00]: Coming out, we have Dynasty Warriors 5 Special working title for the Xbox 360 coming to Japan this winter.

662
00:42:37,336 --> 00:42:42,118
[SPEAKER_00]: We have Dynasty Warriors 5 Extreme Legends on PS2 September 15th in Japan.

663
00:42:42,698 --> 00:42:45,560
[SPEAKER_00]: Dynasty Warriors DS without a release date yet.

664
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:48,701
[SPEAKER_00]: Outside of Dynasty Warriors, we also have...

665
00:42:49,561 --> 00:42:58,465
[SPEAKER_00]: Neo, Summer 2006, Winback 2, Project Poseidon, Romance of the Three Kingdoms for the DS, which will be September 2005.

666
00:42:58,846 --> 00:43:07,490
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also for the Japan-only releases, there's Uncharted Waters Online for PC and Nobunaga's Ambition Online.

667
00:43:07,930 --> 00:43:08,730
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you no show.

668
00:43:09,551 --> 00:43:11,532
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're bringing out a couple of MMOs.

669
00:43:12,292 --> 00:43:15,033
[SPEAKER_04]: Dynasty Warriors 5 for the PlayStation 2 is coming out in September.

670
00:43:15,454 --> 00:43:15,734
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

671
00:43:16,874 --> 00:43:17,254
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

672
00:43:17,274 --> 00:43:17,755
[SPEAKER_03]: In the U.S.

673
00:43:18,335 --> 00:43:18,555
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

674
00:43:19,065 --> 00:43:22,167
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, I know you've got a story about Halo 3.

675
00:43:23,087 --> 00:43:29,952
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Halo 3, there's been some rumors coming out of the Bungie employee area there.

676
00:43:30,732 --> 00:43:35,815
[SPEAKER_04]: They basically said it's going to be more darker and grittier than the previous games.

677
00:43:36,295 --> 00:43:44,881
[SPEAKER_04]: They want to actually have an online cooperative part of the game, which would be fighting bots, which is really interesting, and that's part of the storyline.

678
00:43:45,101 --> 00:43:45,261
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

679
00:43:45,972 --> 00:43:50,515
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot more cinematics Multiplayer mode with up to 50 players online

680
00:44:07,813 --> 00:44:11,115
[SPEAKER_04]: Delta Force Live, Blackhawk Down, up to 50 players online.

681
00:44:11,155 --> 00:44:22,661
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen some on PC that are like 100, so that's not too big a deal, but I'm not surprised that they're going up to 50 players because the big team battle games that are the 60 player are really popular, so I'm not surprised.

682
00:44:22,681 --> 00:44:24,062
[SPEAKER_03]: This was a bit interesting.

683
00:44:24,602 --> 00:44:28,044
[SPEAKER_04]: They're attempting to implement both a map editor and a movie maker.

684
00:44:28,324 --> 00:44:30,205
[SPEAKER_04]: Suns Red vs. Blue.

685
00:44:30,825 --> 00:44:31,866
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

686
00:44:32,146 --> 00:44:35,468
[SPEAKER_03]: That reeks of fan...

687
00:44:36,707 --> 00:44:38,698
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope it's true.

688
00:44:38,718 --> 00:44:39,502
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be pretty funny.

689
00:44:39,522 --> 00:44:39,925
[SPEAKER_04]: You never know.

690
00:44:41,038 --> 00:44:43,499
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

691
00:45:07,290 --> 00:45:08,771
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

692
00:45:25,799 --> 00:45:29,521
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to go ahead and do another story here about Midway and some of the games that they have coming up here.

693
00:45:30,921 --> 00:45:33,483
[SPEAKER_03]: You remember they were partnering up with MTV Games?

694
00:45:33,903 --> 00:45:40,626
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they really haven't said anything new on this, just the LA Rush partnership, but they are saying that a second game will hit in early 2006.

695
00:45:41,347 --> 00:45:46,929
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, what I thought was interesting is they are actually creating a game based on the show from Adult Swim, Aqua Teen Hunger Force.

696
00:45:47,029 --> 00:45:47,590
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, God.

697
00:45:47,770 --> 00:45:49,130
[SPEAKER_03]: And that will be coming out in early 2006 as well.

698
00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:49,711
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be nuts.

699
00:45:51,151 --> 00:45:56,513
[SPEAKER_03]: Mortal Kombat will be coming out on the PSP called Mortal Kombat Deception Unchained.

700
00:45:56,833 --> 00:45:58,874
[SPEAKER_03]: It's supposed to ship in the first half of 2006.

701
00:45:59,514 --> 00:46:09,237
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll have some new characters and content, including some of what was seen on the GameCube version of Deception, like Goro, Shao Kahn actually being playable characters.

702
00:46:09,798 --> 00:46:11,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, Wi-Fi support.

703
00:46:12,038 --> 00:46:13,259
[SPEAKER_03]: More information to come soon.

704
00:46:13,859 --> 00:46:15,800
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, Spy Hunter...

705
00:46:17,677 --> 00:46:21,579
[SPEAKER_03]: They are working on something, but they won't say a whole lot.

706
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:23,920
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I guess I should also say this one.

707
00:46:24,441 --> 00:46:26,041
[SPEAKER_03]: Unreal Tournament 2007.

708
00:46:27,142 --> 00:46:38,408
[SPEAKER_03]: Very early look given at E3, but the next entry in the shooter franchise, they are working very hard to make it a game with as long a shelf life as its predecessors.

709
00:46:38,888 --> 00:46:41,530
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a whole lot of information on Unreal Tournament outside of that.

710
00:46:42,670 --> 00:46:44,891
[SPEAKER_00]: I still need a couple, of course, on PSP.

711
00:46:45,512 --> 00:46:45,932
[SPEAKER_00]: Still waiting.

712
00:46:46,826 --> 00:46:47,186
[SPEAKER_03]: Have fun.

713
00:47:16,055 --> 00:47:19,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a matter of time before that poor guy gets a cease and desist, by the way.

714
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:23,401
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll have that follow up in a future podcast.

715
00:47:25,147 --> 00:47:28,990
[SPEAKER_03]: PlayStation 3, as you guys may or may not know, they're going to go Blu-ray.

716
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:34,855
[SPEAKER_03]: What's interesting is that they are really kind of enforcing that it's not going to be easy to copy.

717
00:47:34,895 --> 00:47:49,786
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, of course, not only Blu-ray piracy is going to be years off as it is, but Sony is working with the Blu-ray Disc Association to prepare the most comprehensive content management system ever employed on an optical disc format.

718
00:47:50,206 --> 00:47:57,788
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm, supposedly it's going to happen through a system called Blu-ray's Advanced Access Content System, and also a ROM mark.

719
00:47:58,228 --> 00:48:03,090
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is made to guard against mass production piracy or duplication and unauthorized copies.

720
00:48:03,530 --> 00:48:05,530
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm, Loki, what do you think?

721
00:48:05,590 --> 00:48:06,151
[SPEAKER_03]: Will it work?

722
00:48:07,131 --> 00:48:14,313
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you know, I remember another story saying that the UMDs would never be cracked and could not be copied because they could not be read by a PC.

723
00:48:15,830 --> 00:48:17,171
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no wait, they're wrong there.

724
00:48:17,831 --> 00:48:18,371
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me put it this way.

725
00:48:18,391 --> 00:48:20,492
[SPEAKER_04]: If it can be read by something, it can be copied.

726
00:48:21,113 --> 00:48:22,393
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the bottom line.

727
00:48:22,734 --> 00:48:24,835
[SPEAKER_04]: It will be done no matter what the hell they do.

728
00:48:25,895 --> 00:48:26,815
[SPEAKER_04]: It will not work.

729
00:48:27,576 --> 00:48:34,219
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically, this is really just going to prevent people until you can copy a full Blu-ray just like you can copy a DVD.

730
00:48:34,259 --> 00:48:36,500
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's going to be harder, but it can be done.

731
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:39,802
[SPEAKER_00]: They said the same thing about the GigaDisc, but you can actually buy GD-ROMs.

732
00:48:41,943 --> 00:48:43,503
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's that.

733
00:48:43,824 --> 00:48:44,744
[SPEAKER_03]: And lastly tonight,

734
00:48:45,431 --> 00:49:06,910
[SPEAKER_03]: GamePro Magazine teamed up with Mad Magazine to present the 10 worst things about video games and you can check out a preview of the 10 actually I'm sorry the article is about the 50 worst things the article online is the 10 and you can check it out over on GamePro.com they have this just a couple of these points see if you guys here in studio agree with them one

735
00:49:07,509 --> 00:49:21,955
[SPEAKER_03]: Game designers who cannot understand why more women don't play video games, especially since they feature such outstanding female role models as a globetrotting archaeologist with big boobs, world-class volleyball champions with big boobs, and, of course, easily murdered hookers with big boobs.

736
00:49:22,435 --> 00:49:25,316
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, of course, they have the picture as drawn by Mad Magazine to go with that.

737
00:49:26,317 --> 00:49:27,637
[SPEAKER_00]: Ho, ho, and ho.

738
00:49:28,177 --> 00:49:33,720
[SPEAKER_03]: Console manufacturers selling systems without basic essentials like memory cards or a second controller.

739
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:37,121
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have to shell out another $60 before you can...

740
00:49:37,847 --> 00:49:39,729
[SPEAKER_03]: See so much as a hair on Luigi's mustache

741
00:49:58,408 --> 00:50:00,629
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, this will make Jamie upset, so I have to read this one.

742
00:50:00,969 --> 00:50:13,813
[SPEAKER_03]: Sega's long, pathetic parade of short-lived console systems, from the Sega CD to the 32X to the Saturn to the Dreamcast, establishing a legacy of failure on its way to rivaling that of the Chicago Cubs.

743
00:50:15,254 --> 00:50:19,035
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the systems only failed because people didn't appreciate them.

744
00:50:20,056 --> 00:50:23,757
[SPEAKER_00]: And Sega, I have to say, had really stupid marketing.

745
00:50:24,357 --> 00:50:27,138
[SPEAKER_00]: They had good systems, good solid systems.

746
00:50:27,888 --> 00:50:29,449
[SPEAKER_00]: But they weren't given the support that they needed.

747
00:50:30,510 --> 00:50:31,651
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the Saturn.

748
00:50:32,131 --> 00:50:33,672
[SPEAKER_00]: The Saturn in Japan?

749
00:50:34,893 --> 00:50:36,014
[SPEAKER_00]: Brilliant system.

750
00:50:36,274 --> 00:50:42,919
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, just had so many great games, would regularly hold its own neck and neck with the PlayStation.

751
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:45,461
[SPEAKER_00]: But over here, did we get a lot of the cool crap?

752
00:50:45,942 --> 00:50:46,122
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

753
00:50:46,782 --> 00:50:49,224
[SPEAKER_00]: The last good game we got was Burning Rangers.

754
00:50:49,905 --> 00:50:52,887
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was actually, if I'm correct, the last game that was on the Saturn over here.

755
00:50:54,008 --> 00:50:56,930
[SPEAKER_00]: Which I, luckily enough, now have a US copy of.

756
00:50:57,538 --> 00:50:59,600
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks to Classic Gaming Expo.

757
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:01,502
[SPEAKER_02]: Still love Mad Magazine after that little tidbit.

758
00:51:02,983 --> 00:51:09,629
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't make me break out like, you know, the broken neck voice.

759
00:51:11,451 --> 00:51:16,416
[SPEAKER_03]: If you guys want, you can check out the list over on GamePro.com or you can just pick up the magazine when it comes out soon.

760
00:51:18,759 --> 00:51:41,672

[SPEAKER_03]: I think so.

768
00:51:53,464 --> 00:51:53,764
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

769
00:51:53,924 --> 00:51:54,644
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll look up the details.

770
00:51:54,804 --> 00:51:55,484
[SPEAKER_00]: You can drive down there.

771
00:51:55,564 --> 00:51:56,445
[SPEAKER_03]: Two or three day con.

772
00:51:56,505 --> 00:51:56,925
[SPEAKER_03]: We could do it.

773
00:51:57,365 --> 00:51:58,466
[SPEAKER_03]: We could do it if we really wanted to.

774
00:51:58,506 --> 00:51:58,846
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

775
00:51:59,566 --> 00:51:59,846
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

776
00:52:00,686 --> 00:52:01,307
[SPEAKER_03]: Final thoughts.

777
00:52:01,387 --> 00:52:01,707
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki.

778
00:52:03,127 --> 00:52:10,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Burnout 3 is awesome, but you know they can really get rid of the announcer or have it so you can bypass the training videos that take up five minutes of my time.

779
00:52:11,604 --> 00:52:15,947
[SPEAKER_03]: My final thought is shake your body, shake your body, shake your body down to the ground.

780
00:52:17,608 --> 00:52:18,788
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, your final thought.

781
00:52:18,908 --> 00:52:27,473
[SPEAKER_00]: I normally say I reject false icons at this point, but I'm just going to say that I'm looking forward to the day that Jack Thompson is laughed out of court, you stupid fucker.

782
00:52:28,814 --> 00:52:30,415
[SPEAKER_03]: And on that note, have a great day.

783
00:52:32,205 --> 00:52:35,792
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the end of another Orange Lounge Radio To Go edition.
