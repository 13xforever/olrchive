You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.

00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:18,500
Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Skye, and Loki.

4
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:28,500
Hello once again, everybody, and welcome to another edition of Orange Lounge Radio To Go, your home for discussion on video games that don't suck.

5
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,500
it's all the news you really want to know about here on Orange Lounge Radio

6
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:36,420
and big thank you to those you guys who helped us I know you mentioned this

7
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,780
Loki last week but since I wasn't here last week I'm back by the way hello

8
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:44,020
this is let's introduce ourselves

9
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:48,260
my name is Rob Roberts you might know me as Skye joining me is DarkSakura

10
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:52,180
How did you get through all the packing tape and the bubble wrap?

11
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:56,300
Very slowly that's why I was gone two weeks. Ah it took you that long

12
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,500
I just thought that they just got tired and shipped you back.

13
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,380
And possibly a little bit of that.

14
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:01,820
And the one and only Loki.

15
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:02,940
I am here.

16
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:03,980
Yes, you are.

17
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:09,820
All right, so we were kind of in an interesting position

18
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:10,340
last week.

19
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:12,500
Since I wasn't here, Loki and Dark Sakura

20
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,580
couldn't use the regular studio.

21
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,860
So they effectively had to record last week's show

22
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,780
through two tin cans and a piece of string

23
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:19,780
or something like that.

24
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:20,860
No, seriously.

25
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:22,540
A laptop and a headset.

26
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:23,620
A laptop and a headset.

27
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:25,460
And I had to edit in stuff.

28
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,500
So don't complain.

29
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,100
So if you're wondering why last week's show

30
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,400
sounded a little bit different,

31
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,000
it's because it wasn't in the usual studio,

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,840
but you know what, kids?

33
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,940
That's how dedicated we are

34
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:35,640
to giving you new material every week.

35
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,740
Some shows would've just said,

36
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:39,060
oh, well, screw it, we're gonna take the week off.

37
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,020
Nope, not us.

38
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:42,380
Not us.

39
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:44,180
Anyway, I just wanted to personally thank,

40
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:45,100
I know, Loki, thank you last week.

41
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,140
I wanna personally thank you guys

42
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,120
for helping us out with the podcast awards

43
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,820
and getting us a win over there for Best Gaming Podcast.

44
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,540
That's amazing, that's incredible.

45
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:54,340
I can't even, wow.

46
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:57,420
I mean this podcast was originally supposed to be the little side

47
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:01,180
show that we figured out maybe like a couple people downloaded the ones that

48
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:03,260
listen to our three hour show and it'll be cute

49
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:08,420
but now this thing is just like blown up huge it's its own thing now and and even

50
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:11,740
on iTunes this week I wanna also say a big thank you to iTunes because we're

51
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:12,420
actually

52
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,780
listed on the iTunes front page under like

53
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:19,220
interesting indies and I thought that was kinda cool to be called like an indie

54
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:20,260
podcast so

55
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:23,500
just to be up there with others well yeah cuz once we start podcasting

56
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,800
everybody's got to start podcasting

57
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:30,860
I know we're trendsetters but that's okay. I'd like to think we were the first podcast but I

58
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:33,760
think Adam Curry might have an issue with that claim so

59
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,860
but we we we got on board we got on board pretty soon

60
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:40,340
anyway let's talk about some games specifically the games we've been

61
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:40,940
playing

62
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:44,140
for the last week or so Dark Sakura what's

63
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:47,660
been going on in your gaming world? I went back to widescreen pong because

64
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:54,340
I'm starting school next week. So I've been going crazy trying to get stuff together. I'm also getting married on September 1st

65
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,820
Congratulations. Sorry, no one can crash

66
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:00,860
But you're invited. Of course, you're both invited. Thank you. If you wanna make it to the courthouse

67
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:06,280
What if the listeners want to send money and send those to a dark side? Okay

68
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:12,980
See, I knew that would change your mind a little bit. It would be a Jamie spell J a m ie

69
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:15,740
i.e. not J-A-I-M-E.

70
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:16,580
Hello!

71
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:17,620
Or J-A-M-Y.

72
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:18,460
No, no, no, no.

73
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,220
Actually, they've been misspelling my name.

74
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,420
Oh, well, yeah.

75
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,740
My name is on our website.

76
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,300
Frickin' spell it right.

77
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:28,860
J-A-M-I-E at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

78
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:29,700
And they can send you money.

79
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:30,740
I'm taking my wedding presents

80
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,140
and Amazon gift certificates.

81
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,300
All right.

82
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,140
Seems I'm not registered anymore.

83
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,740
You'll have to let me know if you actually get anything.

84
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:36,580
That'll be kinda cool.

85
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:37,900
That would be kinda cool.

86
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,680
So no other games in between there?

87
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:46,280
Well, I did play, you know, a couple things with Dan, you know, did nothing major, I played

88
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,280
some PSO.

89
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,560
I just, since I've been so busy trying to get, you know, my school stuff set up, I haven't

90
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,400
been able to dedicate as much time to games.

91
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,020
Now, I hate to call you out on something, but you told me during the three hour show

92
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:00,760
tonight that you haven't been able to put down that Nintendogs five minute demo.

93
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:04,440
You know, I played it like, I played it five times.

94
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,440
In the same day.

95
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,280
I thought you said you, like, burned it out, you played it so much.

96
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,440
No, it's just, I was getting frustrated because I kept playing Frisbee with the puppies and

97
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,460
and then it was like, oh, five minutes is up, bing.

98
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,580
Like, ah, I wanna play with puppies.

99
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,540
Just like a little over a week to go.

100
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,380
A little over a week to go.

101
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,960
Puppies.

102
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,580
Loki, what's been going on in your gaming world?

103
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:25,700
I've been playing lots of games, mostly Burnout 3.

104
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,180
I love that game, every single minute.

105
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:31,040
I must look like some really hardcore crazy guy at my work

106
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,580
because I bring my PlayStation 2 to work.

107
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:36,640
I set it up, within a 15 minute break,

108
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,020
we play two races and disassemble it

109
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,060
and take it back upstairs.

110
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,060
Who makes Burnout 3?

111
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,060
EA.

112
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,860
Are they paying you under the table to say good things about it?

113
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:45,860
No.

114
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:46,860
It's a great game though.

115
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:49,740
But it's also, what's awesome about it is they've price reduced it already.

116
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:50,740
So it's $19.99.

117
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:51,740
Oh cool.

118
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:52,740
You can go out and get it.

119
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:55,420
I'm really anticipating Burnout Revenge, which is coming out in September, which will be

120
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,420
awesome.

121
00:04:56,420 --> 00:05:01,660
Other than that, I've been playing just a variety of import games from Taeku no Tatujin

122
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:04,860
for the Playstation Portable, which is a lot of fun.

123
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:08,820
And then I've also been playing, I tried playing a little bit of Genji Dawn the Samurai, which

124
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:13,820
is going to be coming out here in September, um, really looks cool. I love that game, it's

125
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:18,340
just so pretty. I just wish I could understand dialogue because I can't read Japanese, but

126
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:24,700
whatever. And then AmcoX Capcom, which looks disappointing, actually. Really? I thought

127
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:28,020
it was going to be a cool, like, you know, role playing game type thing. It's a tactical

128
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:33,180
RPG, and I don't like tactical RPGs. When you say tactical RPG, you mean like Advance

129
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:37,440
wars like a fancy tactics like my own fancy tactics okay exactly

130
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:42,620
and uh... it's just i was expecting some different uh... looks the intro movies

131
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:46,800
cool but never got into like tactics or do you know i i i never did i i don't

132
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,680
like i kinda like those games so i gotta check this out

133
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,800
uh... i don't know but

134
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,440
it'll be cool when it comes out over here and then we look at mark not been

135
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,480
loving again

136
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,680
uh... i'm

137
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,200
good to play in this week away seven writer die

138
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,160
all i tried seven sins to this week uh...

139
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,320
It's like The Sims 2, just with nudity.

140
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,520
Honestly, it's exactly like it.

141
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:12,240
It's really interesting and very annoying. I'm sure Seven Sins.

142
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,680
I'm sure that made Jack Thompson a very happy man.

143
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,760
Well, it's in Europe. What's he gonna do? Tell the Europeans to stop their games?

144
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,480
They don't care about nudity. Stop being naked all the time!

145
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:27,440
Next week though, I'm playing 187 Ride or Die and Darkwatch for sure.

146
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,640
You got a busy, busy gaming schedule. I wish my list of games was as impressive,

147
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,800
But sadly, since I've been traveling, all I've had is handhelds.

148
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,960
I finally bought my own copy of Luminous, because it's this long-going story.

149
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,480
If you've listened to the podcast for several weeks now, I bought a copy of Luminous before

150
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,740
I had the PSP.

151
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:47,560
My friend accidentally took it one weekend.

152
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:51,320
I ended up just giving it to him as a birthday present, because he loved it so much, and

153
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,440
I finally went and bought my own copy while I was traveling, since I was on the East Coast

154
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,120
for a couple weeks.

155
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,360
I went to a DDR tournament while I was out on the East Coast, and I played a new game

156
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,480
called Percussion Master, which is pretty cool. It's like a cross between Taiko no

157
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:07,780
Tatujin and Drum Mania, if you're familiar with those games. Taiko Drum

158
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:13,300
Master was the American name of Taiko no Tatujin. Pretty cool game. I liked it. I

159
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:17,840
loved the song list. It was fun, but it's a game that I think might wear thin a

160
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:23,780
little quickly because it doesn't seem to have a whole lot of extra modes and

161
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:26,620
things, but I didn't really have a chance to really prod around the game. It does

162
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:30,740
have a very solid song list and I do recommend any music gaming fan check it

163
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:33,740
out those you guys aren't music gaming fans probably won't ever even find this

164
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:37,060
game because I don't think it'll probably come out on the homes or

165
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:40,500
anything I think it's a very small release otherwise I've just been playing

166
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:45,020
a lot of handheld games I actually tried I kind of forced myself to try and play

167
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:49,220
some DS games that I originally had given negatives reviews for on the show

168
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:53,220
one of them being polarium sorry kids still can't get into polarium Yoshi

169
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:58,860
Touch and Go after playing Kirby Canvas Curse it kind of has a dual effect like

170
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:02,060
I'm able to understand Yoshi Touch and Go more and I'm able to get a little

171
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:06,740
better at it and have a little more fun with it but to me it still feels like

172
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:10,780
you're paying a full price for a game for just like a two level game and I

173
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:14,660
still can't recommend Yoshi Touch and Go I say if you want a game like that just

174
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:18,220
get Kirby Canvas Curse it's a much much more solid game so really it's just been

175
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:21,780
about the handhelds. I still need pack picks. One thing I want to bring up oh I

176
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:25,700
I want I still need to check out pack pics and I want to check out pack and roll too when that comes out

177
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:29,500
Pack and roll is fun. One thing I want to definitely mention about PSPs

178
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:36,620
I used to kind of bash the whole UMD movies on PSP thing as not being a very good idea as what's the point?

179
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:40,620
I'll tell you what after five-hour flights on Southwest

180
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:44,320
PSP movies have become my favorite thing ever. I'm so happy

181
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:51,000
That my friend sharks girl who's been on some of our three hour programs on orange launch radio.com. She loaned me some movies

182
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,900
I finally saw Tron for the first time on PSP and I saw a movie called I robot with Will Smith both great movies

183
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:01,300
Which I surprised me I robot did not look like the kind of movie. I would like at all and I loved it

184
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,300
I thought it was great. So

185
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:08,160
PSP movies are awesome. I still am a little weirded out with the whole idea that you pay

186
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:13,840
$20 for the movie that you're how often you gonna watch the movie on your PSP to really make it worth it

187
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:19,180
Here's my suggestion and I seriously should like trademark this idea or something before somebody steals it

188
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:22,060
And I think I might have mentioned this on a three-hour show or something before him

189
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:25,540
I'm gonna say it again because this is very apparent to me after doing a lot of traveling this weekend

190
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,720
Somebody should start like a rental service

191
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:35,680
For PSP movies in airports and have these places like in all these airports called altitudes

192
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:41,460
Do they do they rent? Yes these oh they do they rent and I think they rent and sell DVDs

193
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:46,440
I thought they only sold them. Well, I'm pretty sure they do. I know they are starting to do UMD games

194
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:51,440
also I think there was I know there's some place that all the tunes I want to

195
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,040
say is one of them but I can't remember they rent or sell I want to say they do

196
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,000
rent though because you can return them to other altitude stores yeah in

197
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,120
different airports I see something like that for UMDs I bet would make a killing

198
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,680
maybe not right away but when you when PSPs really catch on I think it'd be

199
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:10,240
great idea oh they they love those portable games man they're buying well

200
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,880
if altitudes adopts that idea they need to send me a dollar or something for

201
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:19,440
giving the idea anyway let's get into some gaming news tonight boys and girls

202
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,720
starting off with QuakeCon. QuakeCon just happened recently and I heard that

203
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,880
there were some new movies shown for Quake 4

204
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:29,040
I haven't gotten a chance to see this but apparently the quake fans are all excited

205
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:29,960
somebody in chat

206
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:33,540
during the life program this week was really excited about Quake 4. I have seen them

207
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:36,880
What did you think? They were interesting it looks, Quake

208
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,880
though is starting to look more like Halo just because well I wonder why

209
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:45,380
Well, it's not surprising. I mean, it's running on the new Doom 3 engine, which is nice.

210
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:51,380
The movie that I saw is basically, it looks like an all-out war right now.

211
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:56,880
And you're falling in the trenches with this one guy, and you're basically just kind of shooting these other things.

212
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:04,880
And you see gunfire going up overhead and stuff. So it looks just like out of Halo 2, basically.

213
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,880
I don't know. It looks good, though.

214
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,380
Here's what I thought was a really cool piece of information that also came out of QuakeCon.

215
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:14,220
John Carmack actually announced that the Quake 3

216
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,980
source code is going to be released.

217
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:19,100
Now, remember what the Doom source code

218
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,220
release has done for us.

219
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,220
I mean, now we've got Doom on the iPod and all

220
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,300
this crazy stuff.

221
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:26,060
This is going to be pretty cool, Quake 3 source.

222
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,780
I'm just wanting to see what they would turn it into.

223
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:30,740
Yeah, I'm kind of curious to see what kind of side

224
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:31,820
projects come out of this.

225
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,780
Loki, you're kind of more in the hack and crack thing.

226
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:36,020
Is this going to be a huge thing, or what do you think

227
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,780
about the Quake 3 source?

228
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,740
I think it would be cool.

229
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:42,060
I mean, definitely you're going to get some really good games coming out from it.

230
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:46,140
I mean, just look at all the Quake 2 stuff that you had, you know, coming out in all

231
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:50,340
the mods and whatnot, and some of the mods becoming their own games and that type of

232
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,340
thing.

233
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,340
Sure.

234
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:54,340
It couldn't hurt, definitely.

235
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,500
Let's talk about PSP and the firmware.

236
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,820
There's brand new firmware coming out.

237
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:02,000
It's actually going to come out today, August 15th, the day that our show is released.

238
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,980
It was supposed to be out a couple days ago, but they, you know, just have to wait a little

239
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:11,720
bit because I guess there were some recent bugs to fix or something.

240
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:17,100
Just a reminder, the PSP firmware 2.0 will have that new web browser application which

241
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:23,100
lets you browse the internet on your PSP from any wireless hotspot.

242
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,480
So that's going to be pretty cool.

243
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,280
Also enhanced video and audio playback, they're saying.

244
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:33,440
Photo sharing options, broader network connectivity, and a more customizable interface.

245
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,400
So a lot of people looking forward to 2.0, but of course the downside of that, if you

246
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:43,000
upgrade, say goodbye to the NES emulator for a little while, at least until you know they're

247
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,860
going to find a way around the 2.0 fix.

248
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:45,860
They're working on it already.

249
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:47,600
Just give it time, I'm sure it'll happen.

250
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,480
Honestly though, if you're going to be upgrading because of a web browser, just wait, because

251
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,280
they're already working on web browsers, hell, there's four already.

252
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:59,200
I mean, what, if you really want to use a web browser, there's always Wipeout, and there's

253
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,040
already two other ones that they're working on.

254
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,880
Yes, but like, you know, when they release a really popular game for PSP, like let's

255
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,440
say the new Grand Theft Auto game, don't you think these games are going to force you to

256
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,440
go to 2.0?

257
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,360
No, because what they'll do is they'll just dump the ISO of the game, and then you'll

258
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,600
just be able to run it just like normal.

259
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,200
Okay, heaven forbid there should be people out there in the world that buy their games

260
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,200
legally.

261
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:24,880
Okay, yes, you can still buy the game legally, but you can use your own software to dump

262
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,880
the game and then run it on your memory card.

263
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:31,400
That's a lot of work just to run Kid Icarus on the PSP, although it is Kid Icarus.

264
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:35,660
So, I mean, they're getting close, they've already figured out a way to run four gigabyte

265
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:40,860
memory sticks on there, and those aren't memory stick duos, those are the pro ones, and they

266
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,340
figured out a workaround for that.

267
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:48,600
So four gigabyte memory stick that, from according to the guy who did it, 15 UMD games he has

268
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:52,200
on there, plus a whole bunch of homebrew stuff and movies.

269
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:56,800
To which I'm sure Sony is very excited, and I'll be bringing up a Sony anti-piracy story

270
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,240
a little later, which I'm sure you'll love, but in the meantime, let's hear what's going

271
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:05,980
on in the hack and crack world. Well, glad you asked, because we're getting closer and

272
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:12,040
closer to porting Linux to everything, so why not start with the PSP? Of course it's

273
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:17,900
not really ported, it's just emulated. So we have the x86 emulator, and for those not

274
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:22,260
in the know, it's basically a PC emulator, you know, DOS based type of thing. So they've

275
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:27,980
ported over Linux and Windows 95. Windows 95, if I might add, runs very freaking slow.

276
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:35,220
So wait, hypothetically, if x86 is emulated, you could run like Oregon Trail on your PSP.

277
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:39,560
You know, honestly, what you could do is they're talking about, you know, okay, well, about

278
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:44,840
porting Tiger because, you know, all these new things now you can be porting, you know,

279
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:48,980
Apple's operating system to Intel-based, you know, PCs.

280
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:54,460
So if in, I mean, it's only a matter of time, I mean, didn't Oregon Trail come out for the

281
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,460
Amiga?

282
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:56,460
I don't know.

283
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,460
I'm just kidding.

284
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:02,460
It's gonna come out. Eventually, you'll be able to play Oregon Trail on the PSP.

285
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:03,460
Hurray!

286
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:05,460
After all, that's what we're working towards, right?

287
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:06,460
That's exactly.

288
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:10,460
I don't give a shit about Halo 3. I want Oregon Trail on the PSP.

289
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:17,460
You missed it though. Our live show two weeks ago, we had my good friend, customi19, on the show.

290
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:20,460
By the end of the show, she was playing Oregon Trail on her laptop.

291
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:22,460
See? Smart woman.

292
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:26,420
uh-huh other stuff that's going on in the world of the PSP

293
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:29,660
I'm someone actually made a home version of kaboom

294
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:34,980
for the PSP rock on rock on kaboom was like the best Atari 2600 game

295
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:39,260
so simple so simple the concept of the game but ice

296
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:42,700
but I remember being five years old and just being like totally obsessed

297
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:46,260
with kaboom well don't get too excited yet it's still got tons of bugs it's the

298
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:48,000
first game this guy's program it's

299
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,820
program the a language called Lua which you can actually program homebrew games

300
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,500
pretty simple for your PSP.

301
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,700
Okay, plus also the fact that it doesn't have that little dial controller. I'm

302
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,740
sorry, no

303
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:00,940
other controller works the same as those little dial controllers that you had for

304
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,220
Breakout and stuff.

305
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:05,940
It'll ruin it for me. Yeah, so you've got that.

306
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:09,420
So that's one thing you can look at. The other thing is this

307
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:13,300
operating system, or I should say a GUI that they're making called P6,

308
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:16,620
which is going to be able to run homebrew stuff and all that wonderful

309
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:20,500
stuff. Plus they're talking about random wallpapers and yada yada yada.

310
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:28,020
And then my favorite, Scorched Earth PSP, got a version 0.9 release right now, they've

311
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:31,920
got more stuff being worked on, a scoring system, that sort of thing.

312
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,180
But it's getting closer, getting closer.

313
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:38,960
With all due respect, fuck worms, it's all about Scorched Earth.

314
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:45,080
So yeah, now away from the PSP stuff, we've got SCUMM, which was that wonderful engine

315
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:50,920
that ran Maniac Mansion in my favorite game, Monkey Island, the Secret Monkey Island, came

316
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:56,440
to the DS! Perfect! I can't believe that'd be awesome to try that out on the DS with

317
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:03,440
a touch screen. It runs fantastic from what I hear, and there's info on that on this

318
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:12,440
nintendo-ds.dcmu.com.uk. I know, no one's gonna get that. Anyways, it's out there, just

319
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:18,880
rewind listen again okay cool yeah so um really cool stuff very cool all right

320
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,200
let's go to dark Sakura who's got a story for us about well what is this

321
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:29,480
about really well it's put out by BBC news and I'm glad somebody especially a

322
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:34,720
prominent you know source like BBC has pointed out that parents ignore game age

323
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:40,360
ratings surprise big surprise a study commissioned by the UK games industry

324
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,780
found that parents let their children play games for adults even though they

325
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:49,220
know they are 18 rated. To quote Jurgen Freund, he's a modulum researcher,

326
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:53,140
most parents think that their child is mature enough so that these games will

327
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:58,120
not influence them. Parents perceive age ratings as a guide but not as a definite

328
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:05,980
prohibition. There was a case where when the parents of a 14 year old blamed the

329
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:12,400
gave manhunt for his death and the police investigated it and dismissed it

330
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,840
as part of the case you know I'm fine with a parent thinking that their child

331
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:19,920
is smart enough to understand the difference between games in real life

332
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:24,640
because that should be up to a parent to decide you know because like for

333
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,400
instance there's a lot of kids that are like 13 to 18 that I'm sure listen to

334
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,000
this podcast because I know some of them are listening to the three-hour show and

335
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,080
they're smart kids and I know that they're not gonna do anything stupid

336
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:38,280
like this guy who killed some guy over a manhunt and I think in that case if a

337
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,760
parent recognizes that then they should be able to play these adult games if

338
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:47,240
they want but unfortunately it's just those careless parents with careless

339
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:51,240
children that screw it up for everybody else it's just oh there's also a notice

340
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:58,080
on here that between January 2003 and July 2004 16 out of the 1208 games on

341
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:03,760
sale in the UK were given an 18-plus certificate they well did those 16 games

342
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,120
to sell though, I wonder.

343
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,760
Well, they actually interviewed about 1,000 UK adults,

344
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,780
and a further 100 were questioned

345
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:16,000
after buying a video game that was for 18 Up.

346
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,040
Of course, a comment from a couple of the people,

347
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,400
because they allow you to give comments back on this.

348
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:26,760
To allow an underage child to play an 18 plus rated game

349
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,040
is irresponsible parenting.

350
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,960
Not, I disagree.

351
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:36,040
I bet the same person would take their child to an R-rated movie if they screened it first,

352
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,040
you know?

353
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,040
Or if they knew something about it.

354
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,880
And I think if a parent knows a little something about the game, although of course this story

355
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:46,680
talks about ignoring ratings, but I think if the parent knows that their child can differentiate

356
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:51,720
between violence in a video game and violence in the real world, I think that's a parent's

357
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,720
decision.

358
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:59,360
There's also another one on here that says often media hype builds games up to be worse

359
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,360
than they are.

360
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,360
Thank you!

361
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,360
Oh, oh, yeah. Hello

362
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,220
Absolutely. That's right. I think back to

363
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,440
Remember we read a story a couple weeks ago on air about the blind

364
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:16,960
guy who was playing games and kicking people's asses Soulcalibur 2 and the media said that he'd play Soulcalibur 2 and

365
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,380
Decapitate people in the game, which is not something you do in that game

366
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:25,980
Actually, I want to go ahead and read his quote in full if I may sure the guys name is Kenny's from Nottingham

367
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:30,260
He says the violence in video games is often of a cartoon nature.

368
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:34,300
The outcry over Manhunt was laughable because the game was rubbish and wouldn't have sold

369
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:38,340
at all but for the furor in the press.

370
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:41,860
Often media hype builds games up to be worse than they are, and by doing so makes them

371
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:44,960
must-have games that they do not deserve to be.

372
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,620
Grand Theft Auto San Andreas is no different in theme to its two predecessors, but its

373
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:52,460
notoriety ensured its success.

374
00:20:52,460 --> 00:21:08,460
I have something to add to this. There's also a related story. There was a study done in the University of Illinois, and they found no strong link between violent video games and aggression.

375
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:23,460
They basically did a survey watching players play this game, Astrone's Call 2, a popular MMORPG, and basically saying that the results were that no one showed signs of wanting to kill people afterwards.

376
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,460
I'd go crazy if I was stuck having to play Astrone's Call.

377
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:35,460
I know somebody who played Astrone's Call all day, all night, and she was as calm and sociable as could be.

378
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:48,460
Once again, I'd like to mention too, and I was noticing when reading that article that Dark Sakura was talking about in the comments section there, people were saying, you know, there's got to be a way, you know, with DVDs nowadays, you can lock out different DVDs that are, you know, raiding.

379
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:49,460
They're built into the consoles.

380
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:58,460
I know, that's what I'm saying. All these age, you know, prevention things, you know, for mature games, it's all programmed into the consoles. You can lock out content.

381
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,460
You have to have a code to get into it.

382
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:09,460
Yeah, you can lock this stuff out for your kids, so if you're worried about your kids playing games, you know, because you're not supervising them, which you should be doing in the first place, you can lock this stuff out.

383
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:17,460
It's on every single console system, I think from the Playstation up through the PSP now. It's just, it's ridiculous.

384
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:20,820
it's ridiculous. Wow. There's also one parent

385
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:24,500
who replied on this one that talks about how the kids are swapping games with

386
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,780
each other too and so

387
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:28,900
they even don't have any control over that because their kids are taking the

388
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:31,740
initiative. That's a very interesting point but at the same time

389
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:35,420
the parents should still be you know aware of what games their kids are

390
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:35,980
playing.

391
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:39,700
You know. There's another comment on here, this is the last one I'm going to read by

392
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:40,780
Vicky in Glasgow.

393
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:45,340
She says, I definitely agree with the idea that an 18 plus certificate on a

394
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:47,260
game makes it more desirable.

395
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:51,220
My stepson is instantly drawn to the game that he is not allowed to play

396
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:55,580
and it is a problem amongst his peers. In fact, it makes an even greater problem

397
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:57,900
when they are allowed to play these games at friends' houses

398
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:01,820
with the blessing of friends' parents but without our knowledge or consent.

399
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:06,500
Very interesting point there. Kids are sneaky! A very interesting point as well that

400
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:06,940
the

401
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:10,340
mature rating makes us want to play the games more.

402
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:13,380
Think about would anybody have ever bought the guy game?

403
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:21,060
I seriously they call it the sweet 18 and the sweet 18 in Europe basically you

404
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:27,340
know 18 plus games sell better 18 sweet all right let's move on I want to

405
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:30,700
mention something going on in another MMO I'm astronauts call to got brought

406
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:35,060
up in that previous story EverQuest 2 I want to mention this apparently there

407
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:39,100
was a big group of hackers that illegally created like currency and

408
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:45,220
EverQuest 2 and ended up causing the game's economy to suffer by 20% in just

409
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:50,140
24 hours of course then they finally got caught. Chris Cramer the director of

410
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:55,220
public relations for EverQuest 2 said that they had a duping bug that made

411
00:23:55,220 --> 00:24:00,340
large quantities of platinum the game's currency the amount of money in the game

412
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:08,060
was increased by a fifth in about 24 hours hmm very interesting so that's

413
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:13,940
that EverQuest 2 is not a game that I've really played a whole lot but I guess if

414
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:18,780
you do play that game that must have sucked to have that happen kind of

415
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:23,020
strange thinking of such a virtual environment is having its own economy I

416
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:27,800
know I know you know when you stop it just think about that it's like oh my

417
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:32,660
god but but it's a huge part of any MMO Wow has its economy

418
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:39,600
Final Fantasy 11 or any of them. Well but actually PSO though really doesn't

419
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:45,120
because you because there's no auction house in PSO exactly that's you have

420
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:51,200
game controlled shops and basically the only way to really you know players can

421
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:55,160
sell stuff to each other but that's really the only way D it's more of a

422
00:24:55,160 --> 00:25:00,000
barter system and so there's no real economy to manipulate there. I prefer

423
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,440
that actually over the auction house thing though actually that they did

424
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:09,000
limit the total amount of currency you can hold in a blue burst compared to the

425
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,480
Xbox just an FYI because I don't want to get any hate mail over this the economy

426
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:18,120
of the game was brought back to normal after the thing was discovered so if

427
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,840
you're an EverQuest 2 player everything's a-okay you can go back to

428
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:23,480
your ever questing now enjoy your crack and your slash pizza

429
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:28,480
enjoy your crack and your slash pizza all right I know one thing we enjoy not

430
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,160
just our slash pizza but we enjoy getting mail from our listeners so let's

431
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:36,280
hear what the folks who send us some email at to go to go at orange lounge

432
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:41,680
radio.com had to say this week dark Sakura what kind of lovely mail do we get

433
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:47,880
this week we have an email from a person named I hope I don't mispronounce this

434
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:52,400
Yannick hey guys regarding the media player that Loki mentioned on the last

435
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,160
podcast I have purchased the original media player back when I first got my

436
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:59,800
PlayStation 2 and didn't really know what to expect since it came from mad

437
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:04,840
cats and I have a bad history with them however this product is very reliable if

438
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:08,900
your computer is fast enough to stream the video over to your ps2 and if the

439
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:13,800
video is at the 320 by 240 resolution basically going over this saying that

440
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:20,500
Java stuff's buggy but it the bad cats one worked just fine alrighty the one I

441
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:23,280
was talking about though it's a little different than the media player he's

442
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:26,960
talking about. The one I talked about was actually streaming stuff off the Playstation

443
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:33,320
hard drive that you put in there. So, similar, but I think you can do the same type of thing.

444
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:40,320
Any other emails you want to share? Um, we also got one from someone named Blake, who

445
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:48,160
writes us from Atlanta, Georgia. Hotlanta! Hey, I've been to Atlanta plenty of times.

446
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:52,360
I used to stay with relatives over in Alpharetta.

447
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:57,600
I got cousins in Augusta, other than a bit of a drive from there.

448
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,280
You just started listening to our show a few weeks ago.

449
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,280
Great job.

450
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,400
You're one of the two podcasts I listen to.

451
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,400
Well, um...

452
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,400
What's the other one?

453
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,400
No, I'm just kidding.

454
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,400
There's a lot of great podcasts there.

455
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,400
I'm quoting.

456
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,160
Well anyways, listened to your latest show and you were ranting about the game ratings

457
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,520
so I completely agree with you guys.

458
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:15,560
I'm 13 and my parents let me play any game I want.

459
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:19,640
Back when I was around 3 years old, my dad talked to me about game ratings and told me

460
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:22,360
it was all fake and just a game.

461
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:25,000
Been playing Doom since I was 2, literally.

462
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,100
The only games they don't let me play are the ones with nudity and sex.

463
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:32,760
I'm stuck playing my God of War demo for PS2 since I can't get God of War due to the threesome.

464
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:35,240
Luckily, the GTA games never appealed to me.

465
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:39,680
I think you guys should talk more about Bimani since there's a lot of news coming up lately

466
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:42,720
and I'm a huge fan of DDR and every other music game ever created.

467
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:48,520
I think that you should go to the PTA meetings and tell parents they aren't doing their jobs.

468
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,520
That's what we talked about last week.

469
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,520
That's great.

470
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,520
That's great.

471
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:55,040
We said we were going to go march up on the PTA meetings and say, hey!

472
00:27:55,040 --> 00:28:00,160
That's really interesting about the fact that the dad had to talk with him when he was really

473
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,160
young and that's good.

474
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:04,520
And you know what else is really good about that is that, you know, how would the parents

475
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,960
know that God of War has a threesome?

476
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:11,560
What's to stop this kid from going out and getting the game and just saying, oh, that

477
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:15,640
means the parents did their work exactly you know Blake tell your parents that

478
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:19,040
they are doing a fabulous job and they get the dark soccer seal of approval

479
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:22,000
there you go but I think Blake sounds mature enough where you can handle a

480
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,040
little oops they're just boobs come on pixel a boobs I mean come on they're

481
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:30,640
fake there's boobs but you know I do have I really really need to point out

482
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:36,320
this family as a prime example of doing it the right way and on top of that most

483
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,000
kids are smart enough that they know I think they know the difference between

484
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:45,880
what's real and what's not hopefully polygon representation of boobs they

485
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:50,520
aren't really fleshy boobs you have to wait a few years for that do you have

486
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,640
another email you want to read there sir I know I have one I have one I

487
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:58,160
definitely want to throw in here somebody sent an email Noah is the name

488
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:03,560
or N for short and was mentioning that I'm getting back into Final Fantasy 11

489
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:06,520
at some point and was inviting me to come play on the fairy server with them

490
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:13,520
I know because like I used to I used to make jokes about the ferry server on the three the three-hour show it has the

491
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:18,440
Server it has nothing to do with you a kind person who wrote this email

492
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:23,480
It's just it goes back to this whole live journal drama thing and RPG got it people who roleplay on

493
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:28,160
Final Fantasy 11 and just it was just and not that I'm sorry

494
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:31,600
I take that back not that there's anything wrong with role-playing on Final Fantasy 11

495
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,480
But people who take it a little bit too far so that is wrong

496
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:39,480
There's nothing wrong, as long as you know the difference between reality and Final Fantasy 11.

497
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,480
You know what, I would...

498
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:48,480
And this person says that they've been playing since the US PlayStation 2 release, and they're a level 22 slash 11 warrior monk.

499
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:55,480
And they got in there, and this person's inviting me because they don't seem to know a whole lot of people that actually play the game as well.

500
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,480
I totally appreciate the invite, that's great.

501
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:03,480
And I actually had a character on the Faria server for a little while because there's a large contingent on there that I like.

502
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:08,080
there that I like playing the games with and but I just it's not the same people

503
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,160
that were on Bismarck which is the server I was on and I've been smart crowd

504
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:14,480
was good I've gotten I've gotten invites for well of course there's Bismarck I've

505
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:19,680
gotten invites for fairy invites for cerebras and invites for Garuda so it's

506
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:22,240
tough it's tough when there's all these servers I really wish that found a

507
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:26,620
Squeenix at least would let you server hop it would be great so I really

508
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:30,160
appreciate the invite and but I if I go back to the game I'm gonna have to go

509
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,560
back to my family at Bismarck.

510
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,520
However, if you would like to come on over

511
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,260
to the Bismarck server with us,

512
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,720
that's assuming if I even get back into the game

513
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,560
in the first place.

514
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,860
I still haven't decided on that.

515
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:41,620
Send me an email, rob at orangelandrater.com

516
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:43,400
and I'll get you a world pass on to Bismarck.

517
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,840
And plus you can still add me to your play online list

518
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,200
and we can send messages back and forth

519
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,760
and talk about how the economy on our server suck.

520
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,320
So thank you for the invite.

521
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:53,440
I had installed play online.

522
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,520
I know you did.

523
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,440
All right, do you have any more?

524
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,760
PS opium.

525
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,600
No.

526
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,420
All right.

527
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:02,320

this person as well because that was

535
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,920
nice to invite ya and I feel bad that I

536
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,600
have to say no but there's just too

537
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,040
damn many servers on file phase 11 low

538
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,860
keep writing us yeah I appreciate the

539
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:23,920
email Loki you um you have a story about

540
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,080
the DS and it's gonna get cheaper soon

541
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,920
right yep what's gonna be dropping by

542
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:35,040
$20 to $130, and they're saying around August 21st is when that's going to happen, and the

543
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:38,280
other thing is, well what's Sony going to do then?

544
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:41,960
They're thinking about, because I know the Playstation 2 is dropping down to $99 pretty

545
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:42,960
soon.

546
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:43,960
Nice.

547
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:50,880
And they're hoping that that's going to steal some of Xbox 360's thunder, right?

548
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,780
Yeah, I don't think so.

549
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:55,840
So yeah, that's going to be happening.

550
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:00,120
But um, hey, Cheaper DS, Nintendogs, that's not a bad combo.

551
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,120
Puppies!

552
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,820
I think they're kind of smart, I think they're really pushing this Nintendogs thing, I know

553
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:07,560
we have not shut up about this game on the show for several weeks, but there's a reason

554
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:11,680
for that guys, this game is, it's different.

555
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,520
It's the next Pokemon, next Pokemon, I tell ya.

556
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,520
I think so too.

557
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:19,880
And wait til the commercials come, wait til the commercials come, and the little puppies

558
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:24,560
come up on the screen and the little girls are, Daddy, Daddy, I want the game, I want

559
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,560
The Poppy Game! Poppy Game!

560
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:58,280
Basically what it is, is they're asking that folks do a short little test.

561
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:03,520
It's a simple survey and a download on Nintendo.com, okay?

562
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:06,200
And basically what happens is that it's gonna ask for

563
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,280
information on your Internet connection.

564
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:12,040
And all the download does is it just pings Nintendo's servers.

565
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,320
And to kind of entice you to do it,

566
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:18,560
it doubles as a Animal Crossing themed desktop clock.

567
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,280
So a little cute thing there.

568
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:20,960
That's cool.

569
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,880
Yeah, and basically what they're saying here on Nintendo's website,

570
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:27,880
by gathering information on which types of networking equipment our customers

571
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,540
are using

572
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:32,580
and how they have their home network set up, we'll be able to tailor the Nintendo

573
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:33,740
Wi-Fi connection

574
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:37,080
to be easy to use and available to the broadest audience possible.

575
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:42,600
Well that's awfully considerate of them. Yes. Also the FAQ also says by the end of 2005

576
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,440
Nintendo DS owners will be able to play

577
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:48,960
via Wi-Fi, Mario Kart DS, and Animal Crossing DS.

578
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,480
So if you want to help Nintendo out, you want to help those guys out, head on over to

579
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,760
Nintendo.com and download the Animal Crossing desktop.

580
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:59,280
I forgot to mention, coming in this fall when they do the price drop, they're going to be

581
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:05,640
offering a Nintendo DS package where you can get the DS Plus Metro Prime Hunters, not the

582
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:10,200
demo, Metro Prime Hunters for $150.

583
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,280
And what's, any more colors?

584
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,320
I'm surprised we haven't really heard any...

585
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,760
Uh, no, just that, what is it, blue and red, I think that was it.

586
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,760
Yeah.

587
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,760
We haven't really seen the red though.

588
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,720
I want the graphite one, because the graphite one's just cool.

589
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:25,240
I'm kinda surprised. I'm surprised that we're even getting excited about colors.

590
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:27,240
There'll be more colors, don't worry.

591
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:31,160
Where's the clear one? That's what I'm surprised about. All those first advanced,

592
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:34,880
the Game Boy Advance, remember the old one? They were like all clear. I don't know.

593
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:38,400
Anyway. I still have my pink one with my afterburner in it.

594
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:42,440
When about the micro? When's that coming out?

595
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:46,720
Eventually. I think by end of year, but I don't- Dumbest idea ever.

596
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:50,920
I don't think so. I think- I don't think it's a dumb idea, but I don't think it's

597
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,840
it's gonna do well for him.

598
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,120
But we'll see, we might get proven wrong.

599
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:58,080
All right, kids, you know what we gotta do now

600
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,240
at this point is that we need Dark Sakura

601
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,960
to give you guys a little piece of her mind

602
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,360
in the formative advice column,

603
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,600
because if we talked about video games

604
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,240
all the time on this show,

605
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,460
we would have no time to go around

606
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:13,320
and find out the dark lives of strippers.

607
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,920
And those of you guys that listen to the three hour show

608
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,520
know exactly what we're talking about.

609
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,920
The dark side is bleach.

610
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,920
And if you don't know what we're talking about,

611
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,640
you should start listening.

612
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,480
Sunday nights, 930 Pacific Standard Time.

613
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:28,460
Anyway, Dark Sakura, what are you gonna talk to us about

614
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,300
on this podcast?

615
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:33,680
Today's bit of advice is how to deal with a stalker.

616
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:38,200
This is dedicated to my stalker, BlairisKing on DDR Free.

617
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,820
Bravo.

618
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:42,400
Number one, firmly inform the stalker

619
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,320
that if the unwanted behavior persists,

620
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,880
you will take action.

621
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:52,740
threaten to contact authorities, or be a larger, stronger friend or relative. Be prepared to

622
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:57,860
do so. Do not give in to any threats and be ready to secure a restraining order or civil

623
00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:01,620
protection order if it becomes necessary for your peace of mind.

624
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:05,460
2. Inform your family, friends, and co-workers of the situation.

625
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:10,200
3. Keep a paper trail. Save any relevant letters, notes, emails,

626
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:14,920
and voicemails. Maintain a log or diary of your stalker's actions and report any unlawful

627
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:19,080
behavior to the police immediately. Report phone calls to both the phone

628
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:23,880
company and the police. 4. Inform authorities. Do not let fear of

629
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:28,600
retribution stop you from taking action. Take legal action immediately. But my

630
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:34,840
final piece of advice... No means no? PISS OFF!

631
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:42,200
Scary! This story will come as no surprise to any of you but Capcom has

632
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:46,880
announced that they are officially doing Megaman Battle Network 6 I really don't

633
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:50,280
know well I really don't know what else to say about that I mean there's a lot

634
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:58,560
of folks there's a lot of folks that are cooler is that name I can't I don't know

635
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:02,720
but they are Capcom this is one reason I bring it up Capcom is saying the battle

636
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:07,980
network 6 will be the series climax possibly suggesting that it will be the

637
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:14,980
Good, and they can get back to making more Mega Man Legends games, because those games

638
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:15,980
rocked.

639
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:17,980
By the way, Legends is coming to the PSP.

640
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:20,700
I just want more Mega Man X.

641
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:21,700
I forgot about that.

642
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:22,700
I'm totally going to have to get that.

643
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:25,500
And I want it all 2D.

644
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:31,980
Also in the world of Captain Obvious Presents, Zelda will be made for the revolution.

645
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:34,440
I mean, come on, duh.

646
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:37,940
And in other news, there will be a Mario game for the revolution.

647
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:38,940
That's not official.

648
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:39,940
That's not official.

649
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:40,940
And there will probably be a Donkey Kong game.

650
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:41,940
That's not official.

651
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:42,940
Stop spreading rumors.

652
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:43,940
And Smash Brothers.

653
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:44,940
Stop spreading rumors.

654
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:45,940
This is the official.

655
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:47,940
Metroid will make its way to the revolution.

656
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:48,940
And another Banjo-Kazooie.

657
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:52,620
This is the official news, kids.

658
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:59,600
And this is mentioned in an interview with game designer EJ Anuma in Club Nintendo, the

659
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:02,500
company's official magazine in Latin America.

660
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:07,300
About Zelda on Revolution, Mr. Owada has assigned me with the task of doing a Zelda game for

661
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:16,580
the upcoming platform and that is our Duh News of the Week. Dark Sakura, what's

662
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:23,540
going on overseas for our friends in the UK? Well, first of all, Electronic Arts is

663
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:28,900
going to be bringing out everybody loves, oh sorry, we love Katamari. You were about

664
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:32,500
to say everybody loves Katamari. Well, I was thinking Mina Daisuke Katamari.

665
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:35,500
Because that's how I came to think of it.

666
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:38,500
Um, yeah, Electronic Arts is going to be publishing that.

667
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:42,500
I don't actually see anything about the first Katamari Damacy, though.

668
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,500
Didn't they finally get it, but, like, way later?

669
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,500
I think, yeah, way later.

670
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:50,500
But, um, at any rate, it's going to be put out by EA instead of Namco.

671
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:54,500
Um, which Namco is bringing out, um, our version next month.

672
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,500
Hooray!

673
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,500
Um, but now, this isn't...

674
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,500
EA typically does this for Namco.

675
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:01,500
There's a lot of their games that they have done overseas.

676
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:06,340
So this but this is just good news for our buddies in the UK that they will see this game sooner rather than later

677
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:10,900
Well, there's a funny little parody picture. This is we love katamari street

678
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:18,940
Hopefully that hopefully that won't be the game coming out in the UK

679
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:25,300
Hopefully I love though if ever you look on the Japanese cover, you know, and there's big scans of it online

680
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:28,980
You know, it's all the Namco employees out in front of it

681
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:33,680
But if you look in the windows reflected on the windows is the king of all cosmos taking the picture

682
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:38,160
Oh, that's cool. You know, I I didn't get a chance to say this since I wasn't here last week

683
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,900
But I hate the American box art. It's awful

684
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:46,400
I haven't seen it actually it's it's kind of hidden and that parody graphic. It's kind of hidden. It's awful

685
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:51,480
I hope it I hope it was just a mock-up done by some game company because I did not care for the box art at

686
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:55,440
All I've seen the box art. It's it looks like it was done in MS Paint

687
00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:01,720
It's no the box are I think for the new one is the Japanese, but it's with us. Oh, I hope you're right

688
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:07,760
I think it is I could have sworn I've seen it, but I again. I hope you're right and I'm looking crack

689
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:10,960
This is just yeah, that could be true true as well. All right

690
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:17,880
Any more UK news dark soccer. I'm also the the game premiered on

691
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:24,000
the Yahoo UK and Ireland video games is The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe for

692
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:31,720
PS2. It's actually still in production but the review of it is just an awesome

693
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:36,920
review. I mean they are really singing its praises. One thing though that

694
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:40,760
I actually focused on in this that really appeals to me, you know, if you've

695
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:43,580
read The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe it has, you know, for being a

696
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:47,200
children's book, it has a very dark undertone to it and that's what they're

697
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:53,400
focusing on they're trying to bring that out yet get to the positive at the end

698
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:56,560
yes Loki you were telling me at some point that you had actually gotten to

699
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:02,000
play this game it's somehow briefly like briefly five minutes worth it looked

700
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:07,240
very interesting it reminded me very much of the Lord of the Rings game just

701
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:12,320
the way that was because it was kind of that isometric top-down type of thing

702
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:17,120
and it looked pretty good I mean it looked good I honestly don't remember

703
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:21,280
much of the lion witch in the wardrobe I read all the books like way back in

704
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:25,960
elementary school but that's all gone I just know there's a wardrobe involved

705
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:30,800
in a lion and a witch and that's about it well duh all right should be

706
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:35,400
interesting also the one that I was really big into is you know that e3 was

707
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:41,360
called the official site is up call of kulu.com coming out September I was

708
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:44,040
to say, isn't that game coming out very soon? I saw it on the calendar.

709
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:48,320
Yeah, pretty soon. And, uh, but if for any, because I know I've been gushing about the

710
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:53,000
game, but you can, uh, go to callofcathulu.com to check out the official art, uh, background

711
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:57,800
on the Cthulhu myth, uh, you know, myth, the, there's downloads on there. It's a great site.

712
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:00,160
Awesome. Anything else?

713
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,640
Um, one last thing.

714
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:02,640
Sure.

715
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:08,680
Um, not necessarily specifically related to you, eh, to the UK, but, um, Koay, who was

716
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:13,400
pull out one of my favorite games ever, K.O. Yogekutai, K.O. Flying Squadron, back on the

717
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,560
Sega CD.

718
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:20,840
And I remember them for Romance in Three Kingdoms, Nobunaga's Ambition, that's it.

719
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:24,880
They were at Tokyo Game Show and announced their lineup.

720
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:30,960
To quote my source, let's just say, we hope you like Dynasty Warriors.

721
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:35,880
Coming out, we have Dynasty Warriors 5 Special, working title for the Xbox 360, coming to

722
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:37,380
Japan this winter.

723
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:43,380
We have Dynasty Warriors 5 Extreme Legends on PS2, September 15th in Japan, Dynasty Warriors

724
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:46,620
DS, without a release date yet.

725
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:55,260
Outside of Dynasty Warriors we also have Nioh Summer 2006, Win Back 2, Project Poseidon,

726
00:42:55,260 --> 00:43:00,700
Romance of the Three Kingdoms for the DS, which will be September 2005, and then also

727
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:06,580
for the Japan only releases, there's Uncharted Waters Online for PC and Nobunaga's Ambition

728
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:12,620
online here you know show so they're bringing out a couple of them as you

729
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:17,140
were five for the PlayStation 2 is coming out in September Wow all right

730
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:25,020
us all right Loki um I know you've got a story about halo 3 yes halo 3 there's

731
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:30,860
been some rumors coming out of the bungee employee area there they've

732
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:35,700
basically said it's gonna be more darker and grittier than the previous games

733
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:41,620
games, they want to actually have an online cooperative part of the game, which would

734
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:45,840
be fighting bots, which is really interesting, and that's part of the story line, which is

735
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:46,840
really cool.

736
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:50,220
A lot more cinematics, would, you know, that'd be cool.

737
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:53,960
Oh god, the first one was practically a movie as it was.

738
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:54,960
Multiplayer mode...

739
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,900
Sorry, not the first one.

740
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:57,900
The second one.

741
00:43:57,900 --> 00:43:59,620
The first one I really played a whole lot, yes.

742
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:04,840
They're gonna have multiplayer mode with up to 50 players online, which, that's been done

743
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:10,520
already because the last game that came out, Delta Force Live Black Hawk Down, up to 50

744
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:11,520
players online.

745
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:16,320
I've seen some on PC that are like 100, so that's not too big a deal, but I'm not surprised

746
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:20,800
that they're going up to 50 players because the big team battle games that are the 16

747
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:24,360
players are really popular, so I'm not surprised they're going to take it a step further.

748
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:25,360
This was a bit interesting.

749
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:31,200
They're attempting to implement both a map editor and a movie maker, Sons Red vs. Blue.

750
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,200
Wow.

751
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:37,560
That reeks of fan-planted rumor to me.

752
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:38,560
I hope it's true.

753
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:39,560
That would be pretty funny.

754
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:40,560
You never know.

755
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:44,360
I mean, it could be, they've gotten good re- I mean, hello, Red vs. Blue is practically

756
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:45,360
disposed of.

757
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:46,360
Yeah, but Red vs. Blue.

758
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:47,360
And we still have the strangerhood.

759
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:49,600
Red vs. Blue should stay Red vs. Blue.

760
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:52,960
But I don't think it's, I don't think it, I think it's more of like, kind of, they do

761
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:55,760
some really cool combat footage or whatever, anyways.

762
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:56,760
Super thingy.

763
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:01,040
They were also going to say that Zanzibar Sidewinder and Hang'em High are set to return

764
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:05,520
in multiplayer mode, completely reworked, Zanzibar will be mangled and torn apart as

765
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:09,600
though after a battle, the sky will be dark and red, Seinwender is going to have four

766
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:14,200
legs instead of just the two with bases at each end, and Hang'em High will have a massive

767
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:18,120
tree at its center and the structure will be deteriorated.

768
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:21,400
They do some pretty interesting things when they make the maps return from the old games.

769
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:22,400
That's cool.

770
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:23,400
I like that.

771
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:24,400
Yeah.

772
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,400
Alright.

773
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:28,560
I'm going to go ahead and do another story here about Midway and some of the games that

774
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,640
they have coming up here.

775
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:33,900
They, you remember they were partnering up with MTV Games?

776
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:35,840
Well, they really haven't said anything new on this,

777
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,180
just the LA Rush partnership,

778
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:38,620
but they are saying that a second game

779
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:41,260
will hit in early 2006.

780
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:42,400
Also, what I thought was interesting

781
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:43,860
is they are actually creating a game

782
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:45,700
based on the show from Adult Swim,

783
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:47,080
Aqua Teen Hunger Force.

784
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:47,920
Oh, God.

785
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:49,740
And that will be coming out in early 2006 as well.

786
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:51,160
That's gonna be nuts.

787
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:53,880
Mortal Kombat will be coming out on the PSP,

788
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:56,840
called Mortal Kombat Deception Unchained.

789
00:45:56,840 --> 00:46:00,000
It's supposed to ship in the first half of 2006.

790
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,800
It'll have some new characters and content, including some of what was seen on the GameCube

791
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:10,000
version of Deception, like Goro, Shao Kahn actually being playable characters.

792
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Also Wi-Fi support, more information to come soon.

793
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:21,840
And also Spy Hunter, they are working on something but they won't say a whole lot.

794
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:27,320
Oh, I guess I should also say this one, Unreal Tournament 2007.

795
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:34,260
early look given at E3, but the next entry in the shooter franchise, they are working

796
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:39,000
very hard to make it a game with as long as its shelf life as its predecessors.

797
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,040
Not a whole lot of information on Unreal Tournament outside of that.

798
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:45,620
I still need a couple of quests on PSP.

799
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:46,620
Still waiting.

800
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:48,780
Loki, you've got a homebrew story?

801
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:49,840
Just real fun stuff.

802
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:52,520
Someone made this cool little Mario game.

803
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:57,200
It's basically combining the elements of the Super Nintendo version and some of the

804
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:04,400
3d ones it's called Mario was it Mario world blue Twilight DX you can find it

805
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:10,440
at www.mario ween as in Halloween dot TK because it's actually Halloween themed

806
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:15,380
they've actually got boss battles looks interesting go try it out it's free have

807
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:18,920
fun just a matter of time before that poor guy gets a cease and desist by the

808
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:26,360
way yeah and we'll have that follow up in a future podcast PlayStation 3 as you

809
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:30,500
guys may or may not know they're gonna go blu-ray. What's interesting is that

810
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:35,180
they are really kind of enforcing that it's not gonna be easy to copy. I mean of

811
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:41,560
course not only you know blu-ray piracy is gonna be years off as it is but they

812
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:44,940
Sony is working with a blu-ray disc association to prepare the most

813
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:49,700
comprehensive content management system ever employed on an optical disc format.

814
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:54,260
Hmm supposedly it's gonna happen through a system called blu-rays advanced access

815
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:59,700
content system and also a ROM mark and this is made to guard against mass

816
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:03,500
production piracy or duplication and unauthorized copies.

817
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:06,500
Hmm, Loki, what do you think? Will it work?

818
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:11,140
Yeah, you know, I remember another story saying that the UMDs would never be

819
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:14,900
cracked and could not be copied because it could not be read by a PC.

820
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:19,180
Oh, oh, no, wait, they're wrong there. Let me put it this way, if it can be read by

821
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:20,860
something it could be copied.

822
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:25,340
that's bottom line it will be done no matter what the hell they do they could

823
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:29,980
it will not work and basically this is really just gonna prevent people and

824
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:30,660
tell

825
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:34,260
you can copy a full blu-ray just like you can copy a DVD

826
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:38,120
brand yeah it's gonna be harder but anything about the giga desk but you

827
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:39,940
know you can actually buy GD roms

828
00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:43,580
well that's that

829
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:48,760
and lastly tonight GamePro magazine teamed up with mad magazine to present

830
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:52,960
the 10 worst things about video games you can check out

831
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:57,000
a preview the 10 actually I'm sorry the article is about the 50 worst things

832
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:01,040
the article online is the 10 and you can check it out over on GamePro.com they

833
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:01,600
have this

834
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:05,800
just a couple of these points see if you guys here in studio agree with them

835
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:09,480
one game designers who cannot understand

836
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:12,920
why more women don't play video games especially since they feature such

837
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:16,680
outstanding female role models as a globe-trotting archaeologist with big

838
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:17,120
boobs

839
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:21,840
World-class volleyball champions with big boobs and of course easily murdered hookers with big boobs

840
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:25,280
And then of course they have the picture as drawn by mad magazine to go with that

841
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:28,080
ho-ho and ho

842
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:33,560
Console manufacturers selling systems without basic essentials like memory cards or a second controller

843
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:36,960
So you have to shell out another 60 bucks before you can?

844
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:43,840
Play as the article says see so much a hair as see so much as a hair on Luigi's mustache

845
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:48,840
but yeah that kind of bothers me too they say oh the console is coming out

846
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:53,120
it's only gonna be $300 I love that by the way you have to buy a memory card in

847
00:49:53,120 --> 00:50:00,020
a console so this stuff lastly oh this will this will make Jamie upset so I

848
00:50:00,020 --> 00:50:04,120
have to read this one Sega's long pathetic parade of short-lived console

849
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:09,400
systems from the Sega CD to the 32x to the Saturn to the Dreamcast establishing

850
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:15,280
a legacy of failure on its way to rivaling that of the Chicago Cubs.

851
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:20,640
You know, the systems only failed because people didn't appreciate them, and you know,

852
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:24,360
and Sega, I have to say, had really stupid marketing.

853
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:29,240
They had good systems, good solid systems, but they weren't given the support that they

854
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:30,520
needed.

855
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:36,120
You know, the Saturn, the Saturn in Japan, brilliant system.

856
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:43,120
I mean, just has so many great games, would regularly hold it's own neck and neck with the, with the Playstation.

857
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:45,640
But over here, did we get a lot of the cool crap?

858
00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:46,320
No.

859
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:49,440
The last good game we got was Burning Rangers.

860
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:53,040
And it was actually, if I'm correct, the last game that was on the Saturn over here.

861
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:57,120
Which I luckily enough have, now have a US copy of.

862
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:58,520
Still love Mad Magazine.

863
00:50:58,520 --> 00:50:59,640
Thanks to Classic Gaming Expo.

864
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:01,560
Still love Mad Magazine after that little tidbit.

865
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:11,760

876
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:56,720
I'll look up the details you can drive down there two or three day con we could

877
00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:03,280
do it. We could do it if we really wanted to. We'll see. Anyway, final thoughts, Loki.

878
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:07,640
Burnout 3 is awesome, but you know they can really get rid of the announcer or have it

879
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:11,960
so you can bypass the training videos that take up five minutes of my time. My final

880
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:18,240
thought is, shake a body, shake a body, shake a body, down to the ground. DarkSakura, your

881
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:22,680
final thought. I normally say I reject false icons at this point, but I'm just going to

882
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:25,920
to say that I'm looking forward to the day that Jack Thompson is laughed out of

883
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:33,080
court you stupid fucker and on that note have a great day that's the end of

884
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:38,280
