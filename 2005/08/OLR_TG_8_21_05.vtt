00:16.000 --> 00:20.000

00:20.000 --> 00:28.000
Hello everybody, welcome once again to another edition of Orange Lounge Radio To Go.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.080
that podcast dedicated to video games

00:31.080 --> 00:35.240
that don't suck. My name is Rob Roberts you might know me as Sky

00:35.240 --> 00:38.920
joining us via Skype tonight and I know that we say we usually don't do the

00:38.920 --> 00:40.160
co-host over Skype

00:40.160 --> 00:44.760
but you know we can't help cases of sickness or injury and that's what the

00:44.760 --> 00:45.400
one and only

00:45.400 --> 00:48.760
DarkSakura is facing tonight. Hello DarkSakura on the Skype

00:48.760 --> 00:53.400
tonight. What's going on? What happened? Are you okay?

00:53.400 --> 00:57.480
Well I was covering Classic Gaming Expo for us

00:57.480 --> 01:01.360
today and I guess it was a combination of walking around and

01:01.360 --> 01:04.720
you know the driving and then just sitting still practically with my leg

01:04.720 --> 01:05.520
extended

01:05.520 --> 01:09.840
but my hip flared up really bad so I'm sorta hyped up on Vicodin tonight

01:09.840 --> 01:12.960
alright so we can't have her driving over to the studio when she's on Vicodin

01:12.960 --> 01:13.440
so

01:13.440 --> 01:17.680
but you you gotta tell us a little bit about Classic Gaming Expo tonight?

01:17.680 --> 01:21.280
it was about the same as it was last year they had more games that actually

01:21.280 --> 01:21.920
worked

01:21.920 --> 01:25.840
had my picture taken by a millipede that'll

01:25.840 --> 01:29.440
to be somewhere on our site eventually.

01:29.440 --> 01:33.920
Got to meet some pretty cool people, including the guys who do retro gaming radio.

01:33.920 --> 01:35.880
They're pretty cool.

01:35.880 --> 01:40.200
And got to just see all kinds of stuff.

01:40.200 --> 01:41.880
I bought Famicon games today.

01:41.880 --> 01:42.960
Oh, very cool.

01:42.960 --> 01:45.720
Like the original Japanese Nintendo.

01:45.720 --> 01:48.160
I bought Final Fantasy II.

01:48.160 --> 01:49.500
Cool.

01:49.500 --> 01:51.760
And I got Final Fantasy V for Super Famicon.

01:51.760 --> 01:54.920
I got Mappyland for Famicon.

01:54.920 --> 02:01.380
some PC Engine Q-Cards. We actually got a PC Engine in Core Graphics today. Just some

02:01.380 --> 02:04.620
other little bits and pieces that I'll have pictures of shortly.

02:04.620 --> 02:08.820
Alright, sounds good. How did you think this year's Classic Gaming Expo compared to previous

02:08.820 --> 02:10.860
years that you've been to?

02:10.860 --> 02:18.020
It was really, it was empty. Then again, we did go on second day toward the end, but there

02:18.020 --> 02:22.040
was just an emptiness, I felt, to it, which is probably a good idea they're taking next

02:22.040 --> 02:26.760
year off because I'm hoping the one in 2007 is going to be fantastic.

02:26.760 --> 02:32.120
It's supposed to be their anniversary, their, I think, 10th anniversary.

02:32.120 --> 02:33.120
Very cool.

02:33.120 --> 02:38.760
So I'm hoping it's big and maybe, you know, maybe if it works out we can get in on that.

02:38.760 --> 02:41.960
Yeah, I definitely want to check it out when it comes back and they always have a really

02:41.960 --> 02:43.240
good show at E3 as well.

02:43.240 --> 02:46.120
I like the concept of Classic Gaming Expo.

02:46.120 --> 02:49.040
Hopefully a year off we'll just recharge them a little bit and they'll be good to go in

02:49.040 --> 02:51.880
in 2007, so I'm looking forward to that, definitely.

02:51.880 --> 02:54.960
Well 8-Bit Weapon was back. Oh, how were they?

02:54.960 --> 03:00.200
They were awesome as always, and another guy was there

03:00.200 --> 03:03.560
as part of the convention playing music on a keyboard.

03:03.560 --> 03:07.320
Pretty cool stuff. Because sometimes, now I remember the Classic Gaming Expo when I

03:07.320 --> 03:09.360
went last year, they were actually showing

03:09.360 --> 03:12.600
Gradius 5. Konami had a booth there showing Gradius 5.

03:12.600 --> 03:15.920
Midway had a booth showing their

03:15.920 --> 03:19.640
Treasures 2 collection which was new last year. Was there any new

03:19.640 --> 03:22.840
type games they were showing off at the Classic Gaming Expo? Retro?

03:22.840 --> 03:26.400
Not really. Not really? Not a whole lot? Actually, there

03:26.400 --> 03:30.280
there were people who were doing, you know, new prototypes

03:30.280 --> 03:34.240
but nothing, you know, there was the television people were there again.

03:34.240 --> 03:38.940
Right. There was a guy, he said it's actually someone in Brazil makes these, but they

03:38.940 --> 03:41.000
take the MSX games, like the

03:41.000 --> 03:45.520
Metal Gear and the original Metal Gear 2 were on MSX, as was the

03:45.520 --> 03:49.960
the Guardian Legend, it was called Guardia, they were all MSX games and they have them

03:49.960 --> 03:55.240
remade to play on the Colecovision.

03:55.240 --> 04:02.320
That was neat, but there wasn't anything really new there, nothing like what Guardia 5 was

04:02.320 --> 04:03.320
last year.

04:03.320 --> 04:10.620
Alright, well we'll look forward to more reports on Classic Gaming Expo on our website, www.orangelaungeradio.com.

04:10.620 --> 04:14.960
Dark Sakura's picture collection will be posted sometime during the week, so we look forward

04:14.960 --> 04:18.620
Now, I haven't forgotten, four minutes into the show, but I haven't forgotten the one

04:18.620 --> 04:21.760
and only Tech Masa Loki over there in studio tonight.

04:21.760 --> 04:24.720
I wasn't even paying attention, I was reading.

04:24.720 --> 04:26.400
What are you, not a classic gaming fan?

04:26.400 --> 04:27.400
What's up with that?

04:27.400 --> 04:28.400
No, I'm a classic gaming fan.

04:28.400 --> 04:32.280
I was kind of zoned out there because I was looking up stuff for the show.

04:32.280 --> 04:33.280
I was researching.

04:33.280 --> 04:39.120
Well, since I let Dark Sakura do a little report there, why don't you give us one of

04:39.120 --> 04:42.240
your stories you're looking at tonight from the hack and crack scene.

04:42.240 --> 04:49.240
My report, I was just kind of browsing stuff. One of them is a mod for Half-Life 2 called Half-Life 2 Fueled.

04:49.240 --> 04:56.240
And because Half-Life 2 is famous for its ragdoll physics and playing with the ragdoll physics.

04:56.240 --> 05:00.240
They have some really kickass shots from this.

05:00.240 --> 05:05.240
Just like, you know, for example, tons of cars just all strewn about the place.

05:05.240 --> 05:11.240
It looks like it's going to be pretty cool. They've got some ramps in this little demo thing here.

05:11.240 --> 05:18.120
thing here. You can find out more about it on www.fueledmod.com and they've got some

05:18.120 --> 05:20.800
interesting stuff on there. So, yeah, cool.

05:20.800 --> 05:25.160
Alright. Alright, well now what I want to do is I want to go ahead and start off tonight's

05:25.160 --> 05:27.960
show, even though we had a couple stories there, to start off tonight's show talking

05:27.960 --> 05:32.000
about what we like to always start off the show talking about, what games have we, the

05:32.000 --> 05:35.400
host, been playing this week. DarkSakura, what have you been playing this week in your

05:35.400 --> 05:36.400
game and world?

05:36.400 --> 05:42.080
Well, seeing as how I started school this week, I haven't had a whole bunch of time

05:42.080 --> 05:46.640
and I actually am going to be signing back up for Ragnarok Online again.

05:46.640 --> 05:50.580
It's funny you should talk about signing up for old MMOs.

05:50.580 --> 05:53.840
You're not signing back up for Final Fantasy XI, are you?

05:53.840 --> 05:56.920
I wouldn't say I'm not going to.

05:56.920 --> 05:57.920
Anyway.

05:57.920 --> 06:05.820
I'm going to give Ragnarok a try for a month to see if I really miss it as badly as I think

06:05.820 --> 06:08.660
I do that's my philosophy on Final Fantasy as well

06:09.300 --> 06:14.860
But they have like a pay seven dollars and for 30 hours a gameplay, so I'm gonna give that a go okay

06:14.860 --> 06:17.980
Sounds good this for a month. I did I

06:18.620 --> 06:20.620
hunted down the vet tracks and

06:21.180 --> 06:24.620
Then I remembered why I don't play the vet tracks because it kind of gave me a headache

06:24.660 --> 06:27.060
But the vet tracks was just a cool idea really

06:28.180 --> 06:30.180
well true

06:30.460 --> 06:32.460
I also

06:32.460 --> 06:36.740
I tried out a couple of HuCards at Classic Gaming Expo today.

06:36.740 --> 06:41.740
Actually, I also watched Dan try out some of the ones that we bought. We got

06:41.740 --> 06:43.700
Sanson 2. That game is cool.

06:43.700 --> 06:46.380
Wow, I don't think I've heard of that.

06:46.380 --> 06:50.620
Oh yeah, okay, I have heard of that, but that's a, wow, that's an obscure game.

06:50.620 --> 06:54.740
Yeah, pretty obscure. A lot of stuff at Classic Gaming I suppose is obscure.

06:54.740 --> 06:58.780
We also got Legend of the Valkyrie, which is one of

06:58.780 --> 07:03.180
uh, Namco's classic games. Very cool. But not a lot of other current games you've been

07:03.180 --> 07:04.620
playing this week? Just the old stuff?

07:04.620 --> 07:08.940
Just the old stuff. You know, I had to get my retro gaming back on.

07:08.940 --> 07:12.980
Nothing wrong with that. Nothing wrong with that. Uh, Loki, what games have you been playing this week?

07:12.980 --> 07:17.580
Um, I've been playing pretty much the same stuff I was playing last week. I played

07:17.580 --> 07:21.300
a teeny bit of Darkwatch, because it came out this week.

07:21.300 --> 07:25.140
Um, it's really cool, but I haven't really gotten to play much of it.

07:25.140 --> 07:31.300
Burnout 3 like crazy been playing that every second that I could possibly play it. It's really fun

07:31.300 --> 07:34.160
I've just haven't played much of the tracks, but I did do

07:34.860 --> 07:38.220
54 takedowns in one race that was fun and

07:39.100 --> 07:44.040
Then I was playing also on the PSP Taiko no Tatujin

07:45.580 --> 07:50.800
So so taiko drum master here in the u.s.. Yes, that's got to be weird on the PSP though

07:50.800 --> 07:53.100
I mean it works really good actually yeah

07:53.100 --> 07:58.020
I kind of looked over your shoulder while you were playing it and it looks really crisp

07:58.020 --> 08:01.100
and it's just like the PlayStation 2 version right on your little PSP.

08:01.100 --> 08:03.420
Yeah, it's really good and it's pretty fun.

08:03.420 --> 08:08.040
I just wish it was in English so I'd be able to understand what menus were and stuff because

08:08.040 --> 08:09.540
it's a pain in the ass.

08:09.540 --> 08:14.580
But someone did make some on Game Facts, I think, English translations of the menus so

08:14.580 --> 08:15.580
that helps.

08:15.580 --> 08:16.580
That's always helpful.

08:16.580 --> 08:17.580
Yeah.

08:17.580 --> 08:18.580
Those Game Facts people are always very helpful.

08:18.580 --> 08:20.340
It is, but you know what they could help me out with?

08:20.340 --> 08:27.200
Cheats for freaking burnout three because I gotta play through these races and I'm not liking that I need I need my fast cars now

08:27.460 --> 08:32.480
Alright, um, I my gaming week. Is that all you've had? I'm sad

08:32.480 --> 08:38.900
It's all I have right my gaming week has consisted of my well. I was sick this week. Actually Jamie has

08:39.660 --> 08:43.220
Unfortunately her hip but I've been sick. I had a sinus infection earlier this week

08:43.220 --> 08:48.420
So if I sound my voice is a little more nasal than it even usually is it's because I've been sick

08:48.420 --> 08:53.940
so that kind of kept me down for a little bit but I was I did finally go

08:53.940 --> 08:59.560
out on Saturday and buy a an American PlayStation 2 I've had a Japanese one for

08:59.560 --> 09:03.540
years to get my music gaming fix out of the way and but since I was living with

09:03.540 --> 09:08.580
Loki for such a long time he had an American PlayStation 2 I didn't have a

09:08.580 --> 09:12.020
need for my own so I finally went and bought one on Saturday I bought one of

09:12.020 --> 09:17.100
the little chibi miniature ones it's I really hadn't seen one because everybody

09:17.100 --> 09:21.440
else I know got their PlayStation 2s like years ago, so they're huge, so I hadn't really

09:21.440 --> 09:27.580
seen the tiny ones up close. Damn, those are tiny PlayStations! Dang, they are so small,

09:27.580 --> 09:32.220
I was shocked. But it's great, it works out great for my storage space and everything.

09:32.220 --> 09:36.420
So I picked up two games, I picked up Final Fantasy X, because I had the urge to play

09:36.420 --> 09:41.000
through that again, and Katamari Damacy, because I just freaking love that game. And I'm gonna

09:41.000 --> 09:45.780
pick up other... What? I could have just loaned you mine indefinitely, since I have Final

09:45.780 --> 09:46.780
Final Fantasy X International.

09:46.780 --> 09:47.780
Ah!

09:47.780 --> 09:48.780
Now I know.

09:48.780 --> 09:49.780
Oh well.

09:49.780 --> 09:50.780
It's only 20 bucks.

09:50.780 --> 09:51.780
I'm throwing it half the hassle.

09:51.780 --> 09:53.780
You're getting a little quiet there, Jamie.

09:53.780 --> 09:54.780
Okay.

09:54.780 --> 09:55.780
Sorry, my headset moved back.

09:55.780 --> 09:56.780
Oh, that's alright.

09:56.780 --> 09:58.780
I'm throwing it half the hassle.

09:58.780 --> 09:59.780
Alright.

09:59.780 --> 10:07.780
Um, anyway, um, also, um, I bought the Playstation 2 so that I could, you know, screen new games

10:07.780 --> 10:11.820
if we start getting any screeners, um, I should say additional screeners from like, you know,

10:11.820 --> 10:12.820
media companies and stuff.

10:12.820 --> 10:13.980
I do have demos at work.

10:13.980 --> 10:14.980
I haven't brought them in though.

10:14.980 --> 10:19.260
So we'll start taking a look at those, and as well as just renting some games and checking

10:19.260 --> 10:22.280
things out so I can keep a tab on what's going on.

10:22.280 --> 10:27.780
Also other than the Playstation 2, as Dark Sakura made me admit a little bit ago, I also

10:27.780 --> 10:32.460
renewed Final Fantasy XI because I was sick and home from work and really bored, and I

10:32.460 --> 10:34.900
thought, you know, I kind of miss this game.

10:34.900 --> 10:37.620
No, not just that, Dark Sakura, wait until you hear this.

10:37.620 --> 10:41.940
Not only did I get back into Final Fantasy XI, I got my roommate, Christopher, into Final

10:41.940 --> 10:42.940
People are cultists!

10:42.940 --> 10:43.940
I escaped!

10:43.940 --> 10:44.940
I escaped!

10:44.940 --> 10:57.140
You sure did, but you're in Ragnarok, which is, you know, some people would say just as

10:57.140 --> 10:58.140
bad.

10:58.140 --> 11:02.460
Hey, I've been in Ragnarok for like, what, five years?

11:02.460 --> 11:03.460
Six years?

11:03.460 --> 11:04.460
Yeah, well.

11:04.460 --> 11:05.460
You're still getting quiet there.

11:05.460 --> 11:06.780
My addiction is stronger than your addiction.

11:06.780 --> 11:08.920
You're a little quiet there, DarkSogra.

11:08.920 --> 11:11.180
My addiction is stronger than your addiction.

11:11.180 --> 11:16.020
My addiction is mighty, and to be feared.

11:16.020 --> 11:17.220
We'll see about that.

11:17.220 --> 11:21.420
Alright, let's get into this week's news, starting off with, of course, the big thing

11:21.420 --> 11:26.980
everybody is talking about this week, Zelda Twilight Princess got the big old delay to

11:26.980 --> 11:34.060
Spring 2006, and of course, the question heard around the world, what the hell, Nintendo?

11:34.060 --> 11:35.060
What the hell?

11:35.060 --> 11:38.820
You had this game ready to show us at E3, and we thought you were all ready to go in

11:38.820 --> 11:44.400
the fall but now they're saying no we need more time we're announcing a new

11:44.400 --> 11:48.420
global launch in 2006 after the conclusion of the fiscal year so no

11:48.420 --> 11:52.680
earlier than April 1st will provide a specific date at a later point in time

11:52.680 --> 11:56.760
while this may come as a disappointment it will absolutely enrich the game and

11:56.760 --> 12:00.420
make it a multi-million seller I don't know about that because I've been that

12:00.420 --> 12:08.700
anyways I know but there's what yeah hopefully it's released

12:08.700 --> 12:13.620
around your birthday, but the reason why they say they're doing this is because they're

12:13.620 --> 12:18.300
adding extra things to it, who knows, the game could be buggy as hell, who really knows

12:18.300 --> 12:22.300
why this game got pushed back, but what they're saying is that they're trying to add new things

12:22.300 --> 12:27.780
to it, which I suppose is good news, but at the same time, it's not like there's been

12:27.780 --> 12:32.300
a flood of GameCube games lately, they really should have been working on this double time

12:32.300 --> 12:33.300
a while ago.

12:33.300 --> 12:38.740
What we've got is a bunch of game testers going, BUT I HAVEN'T BEATEN IT YET, DELAY!

13:03.300 --> 13:06.860
you know because by that point the PlayStation 3 will be out almost

13:06.860 --> 13:10.500
maybe maybe not Xbox 360 will be out will be

13:10.500 --> 13:13.540
hopefully having more details on Nintendo's revolution so it'll be like

13:13.540 --> 13:18.060
you know Zelda Twilight Princess was kinda as amazing of a game as it looked

13:18.060 --> 13:21.180
I it's it's almost a little late for this game to be coming out

13:21.180 --> 13:25.940
so I'm a little disappointed. I just say when it comes out it needs to be something freakin' fantastic

13:25.940 --> 13:30.180
but a good game is a good game right? Yes a game

13:30.180 --> 13:33.300
is only as good as how it plays. That's true. Loki, your thoughts?

13:33.300 --> 13:38.820
Um, yay. You know, they give me a reason to dust off my GameCube, but

13:38.820 --> 13:42.460
oh well. Um, I was gonna mention also

13:42.460 --> 13:45.940
another delay that pisses the hell out of me. Final Fantasy

13:45.940 --> 13:50.980
Advent Children's not coming out until the end of November, November 30th.

13:50.980 --> 13:54.740
Not many places have actually, no one's really said anything about this delay, but

13:54.740 --> 13:56.100
I have the inside info

13:56.100 --> 13:59.660
being that I work for a video distributor, so. Mmm. So it,

13:59.660 --> 14:02.900
that's straight from Sony folks well okay

14:02.900 --> 14:05.940
guys gotta hate it but I hope I hope I'm wrong

14:05.940 --> 14:10.340
and I hope that that that you know date is just pull out thin air and so he is

14:10.340 --> 14:11.340
another talk about but

14:11.340 --> 14:15.100
I'm afraid strip you know speaking of Advent Children you know how they're

14:15.100 --> 14:17.020
gonna be doing those screenings in Japan

14:17.020 --> 14:20.300
well the only way you're gonna be able to get into the screenings in Japan

14:20.300 --> 14:23.900
which by the way is only taking place in three major cities across Japan

14:23.900 --> 14:28.660
on you're gonna have to be a member of their fan club now I have obviously

14:28.660 --> 14:32.620
the majority of our listening audiences in the United States, Canada

14:32.620 --> 14:36.040
and some in Europe so probably not a whole lot of Japanese listeners we've

14:36.040 --> 14:36.840
got but

14:36.840 --> 14:40.040
if you are listening to us and you're interested in going you need to be

14:40.040 --> 14:43.200
registered with the Shinra Company online fan club

14:43.200 --> 14:47.500
and I'm guessing if you're not already signed up you might have lost out because I don't

14:47.500 --> 14:49.440
think they're accepting new club members anymore

14:49.440 --> 14:53.940
so they will randomly select people if they get too many people that want to

14:53.940 --> 14:54.480
get in

14:54.480 --> 14:58.600
it's going to be happening September 10th through the 16th

14:58.600 --> 15:04.800
in Tokyo, Nagoya, and Kyoto will be the three cities that will be showing

15:04.800 --> 15:08.520
Final Fantasy Advent Children on the big screen.

15:08.520 --> 15:12.200
Otherwise you're gonna have to wait for the UMD and DVD formats

15:12.200 --> 15:18.060
here in America as well. One other story, I know the big news this week, the game

15:18.060 --> 15:21.080
we're all excited about is Nintendogs is coming out this week.

15:21.080 --> 15:25.420
I'm very excited about this. Here's the interesting thing about Nintendogs,

15:25.420 --> 15:29.460
they're actually going to be getting a special holiday edition well okay it's

15:29.460 --> 15:34.580
kind of a rumor right now but Nintendo of America did file some some papers

15:34.580 --> 15:40.640
with the ESRB that indicate something called Nintendogs holiday edition and we

15:40.640 --> 15:45.340
all know how Nintendo loves to get you to buy the same crap in new packaging

15:45.340 --> 15:49.420
over and over again so this really wouldn't be a surprise if this is

15:49.420 --> 15:53.080
something they are actually doing Nintendogs holiday edition what do you

15:53.080 --> 15:59.080
Are they being premature with this though, since the game hasn't even come out here?

15:59.080 --> 16:02.080
It could be a massive failure here, I doubt it will be, but it could be.

16:02.080 --> 16:07.080
No, it's not going to be a failure, and it's coming out right after my wedding, you know.

16:07.080 --> 16:13.080
Is that a hint? You're already going to get it. We don't have to buy it for your wedding, you're already going to have it.

16:13.080 --> 16:22.080
Of course. No, I honestly see the game being a big success, because if there's one thing Nintendo understands, it's a formula.

16:22.080 --> 16:29.080
a formula. You know, we have Pokemon as our big example. They know what's going to appeal,

16:29.080 --> 16:34.340
and there's already been so much hype from the Japanese version, it's already so widely

16:34.340 --> 16:39.340
popular, that, you know, I don't see any way for the game to fail.

16:39.340 --> 16:45.160
Well, we'll see. We'll see this week when the game comes out. Alright, moving on, I

16:45.160 --> 16:49.320
did want to say one other thing about Nintendo, and that is the Game Boy Micro. The Game Boy

16:49.320 --> 16:55.860
the game boy micro are going to come for $99.99

16:55.860 --> 17:00.280
now for those of you who weren't sleeping during E3 coverage

17:00.280 --> 17:03.740
it's like the game boy advance but really freaking tiny

17:03.740 --> 17:05.740
like a palm of your hand tiny

17:05.740 --> 17:07.740
its a little bigger then the game boy advance cartridges

17:07.740 --> 17:10.760
if you go look on our E3 pictures

17:10.760 --> 17:13.280
they have a pretty close up image of one

17:13.280 --> 17:16.220
they do we do have that in the gallery

17:16.220 --> 17:19.220
four inches wide this thing is it's it's tiny

17:19.220 --> 17:21.500
uh... ninety nine ninety nine it'll be coming out

17:21.500 --> 17:26.320
uh... september nineteenth is the day this is coming out also face plates the

17:26.320 --> 17:29.420
face plate changing is a big thing they're doing with this so you can have

17:29.420 --> 17:32.660
uh... a gameboy micro that like matches your purse or something i don't know

17:32.660 --> 17:37.620
flame camouflage or just simple silver

17:37.620 --> 17:39.340
well that's one of them

17:39.340 --> 17:42.900
if you buy the silver you get those if you buy black you get uh... some

17:42.900 --> 17:44.340
stupid flower

17:44.340 --> 17:46.620
Oh, Ladybug. Okay, I see.

17:46.620 --> 17:49.100
With the Ladybug. I see where these others come in, okay.

17:49.100 --> 17:51.660
And Ammonite for Dark Swirly Blue.

17:51.660 --> 17:57.700
And also, yeah, they come with the silver or black faceplate, depending on whether yours is silver or black.

17:57.700 --> 18:03.660
Okay. Japanese release will be September 13th, and it will be coming out for 12,000 yen.

18:03.660 --> 18:06.980
That's about $109, so it's a little more expensive in Japan.

18:06.980 --> 18:13.820
But get this, for our European friends, we're paying $99, they're paying 99 euro,

18:13.820 --> 18:17.480
and the euros worth a little more so that's a hundred and twenty one dollars

18:17.480 --> 18:20.600
u s november fourth but they get paid too bad

18:20.600 --> 18:22.440
yes but they get pink

18:22.440 --> 18:24.220
not that you know

18:24.220 --> 18:26.380
yeah i know

18:26.380 --> 18:30.420
we're gonna take a minute to uh... open up the old mailbag here at orange lounge

18:30.420 --> 18:33.640
radio remember you guys can send in your questions

18:33.640 --> 18:36.860
for orange lounge radio at our address it's to go

18:36.860 --> 18:38.140
t o g o

18:38.140 --> 18:39.980
at orange lounge radio

18:39.980 --> 18:41.660
dot com

18:41.660 --> 18:45.460
So we have a couple of letters this week, the first letter I'd like to read comes from

18:45.460 --> 18:50.580
Sithspawn is the name of the person, actually it's Brian from Michigan is how they signed

18:50.580 --> 18:52.300
it, so that must be his online name.

18:52.300 --> 18:56.940
Brian from Michigan says he knows he's beating a dead horse here a little bit but he wants

18:56.940 --> 19:00.900
to make the following point, I don't have any kids and I don't ever want them, however

19:00.900 --> 19:05.000
I do have a few words concerning video game violence and ratings.

19:05.000 --> 19:09.820
The main problem originates with the many groups pushing for stricter ratings and or

19:09.820 --> 19:11.420
the banning of certain games.

19:11.420 --> 19:15.300
Attempting to completely block games from kids at the point of sale level is a massive

19:15.300 --> 19:16.780
waste of effort.

19:16.780 --> 19:20.600
Much like drugs and alcohol, you will never keep games away from someone who actively

19:20.600 --> 19:22.140
seeks them out.

19:22.140 --> 19:26.540
Kids will play games at their friends' houses, at stores, or acquire them from others.

19:26.540 --> 19:28.640
There is nothing parents can do to stop this.

19:28.640 --> 19:32.460
I think we have good point of sale controls now and that's enough.

19:32.460 --> 19:36.180
Brian from Michigan is suggesting there are two simple steps to deal with this problem.

19:36.180 --> 19:37.180
1.

19:37.180 --> 19:38.180
Know your games.

19:38.180 --> 19:41.860
As a parent, you need to know about the ratings and actually play these games.

19:41.860 --> 19:44.820
Also, take the ratings with a grain of salt.

19:44.820 --> 19:48.340
The opinions of the ESRB aren't necessarily your own.

19:48.340 --> 19:49.340
2.

19:49.340 --> 19:50.340
Instruct your child.

19:50.340 --> 19:54.380
The only way to prevent your kid from playing the games you do not want them to play is

19:54.380 --> 19:57.300
to ensure that they do not want to play them.

19:57.300 --> 19:59.860
It's exactly the same as saying no to drugs.

19:59.860 --> 20:05.220
It's all about the child making decisions based on input from the parents.

20:05.220 --> 20:10.260
Give your kid the tools he or she needs to make educated decisions when you are not around.

20:10.260 --> 20:11.260
Very interesting.

20:11.260 --> 20:13.420
I like his steps there that he offers there.

20:13.420 --> 20:17.220
A very educated response from our friend, Sith Spawn.

20:17.220 --> 20:19.220
I was very impressed with that letter.

20:19.220 --> 20:21.260
Yes, it was very nice.

20:21.260 --> 20:22.480
We also have another letter here.

20:22.480 --> 20:25.260
This letter is from another Jamie.

20:25.260 --> 20:28.760
It actually could be Jaime, but we think it's Jamie.

20:28.760 --> 20:32.900
Jamie's been listening to the show for two months now and says it's really interesting.

20:32.900 --> 20:33.900
Thank you.

20:33.900 --> 20:36.640
you guys won the podcast award, partially because of my vote.

20:36.640 --> 20:37.640
Thank you again.

20:37.640 --> 20:38.640
Very kind.

20:38.640 --> 20:42.840
I know exactly what you mean about the misspelling of your name in talking to our own Jamie here.

20:42.840 --> 20:45.480
I have the exact same problem, but in reverse.

20:45.480 --> 20:49.020
This person spells their name J-A-I-M-E.

20:49.020 --> 20:50.880
So very interesting.

20:50.880 --> 20:54.440
We were talking about Evercrack's economy.

20:54.440 --> 20:59.140
Well, Jamie actually sent us a link to an article about the economy, and it's a really

20:59.140 --> 21:02.220
good link to a story that has more information on the economy.

21:02.220 --> 21:12.460
It's http colon slash slash mu dot ranter r-a-n-t-e-r dot net slash theory slash economy

21:12.460 --> 21:14.460
dot html.

21:14.460 --> 21:19.040
And actually what this is, this is kind of like an opinion piece about the economy inside

21:19.040 --> 21:20.040
video games.

21:20.040 --> 21:21.340
It's a really well written piece.

21:21.340 --> 21:22.820
So if you guys have some time, check that out.

21:22.820 --> 21:23.820
That's very cool.

21:23.820 --> 21:28.380
Also, Jamie wanted to point out a website called Stop Stop Kill dot com.

21:28.380 --> 21:31.980
Jamie, did you have a chance to check out Stop Stop Kill dot com?

21:31.980 --> 21:37.600
Ashley, this is one I knew about and it's, at the time it was more of a placeholder but

21:37.600 --> 21:41.100
it actually is, looks like it's gone full active.

21:41.100 --> 21:43.980
It's about the truth about violence in video games.

21:43.980 --> 21:48.660
Is someone else, you know, trying to get the word out there?

21:48.660 --> 21:54.560
Basically there, any type of research that's being done in regards to video games, they're

21:54.560 --> 22:00.960
putting this up on their site and then, you know, also putting out, trying to give the

22:00.960 --> 22:06.000
whole broad spectrum you know but also trying to say hey this is where you are

22:06.000 --> 22:12.920
wrong hmm it's a pretty awesome site so far I'm pretty impressed with it it also

22:12.920 --> 22:18.320
there's a forum on here it says gamers against Jack forum interesting Jack

22:18.320 --> 22:26.440
Thompson and also it links back to Jack Thompson site stop kill calm which is

22:26.440 --> 22:28.960
basically talking is basically more of

22:28.960 --> 22:30.280
Jack Thompson talking out of his ass

22:30.280 --> 22:34.800
well it's true the man's the man I hate

22:34.800 --> 22:36.720
to say well I'm not I don't really hate

22:36.720 --> 22:38.640
to say it but he's freaking idiot hmm

22:38.640 --> 22:40.420
Jack Thompson if you're listening

22:40.420 --> 22:43.000
you're a moron thank you for that he'll

22:43.000 --> 22:45.240
appreciate that and you can sue me for

22:45.240 --> 22:46.800
calling you a moron because that's my

22:46.800 --> 22:48.520
personal opinion and not a personal

22:48.520 --> 22:51.240
attack all right anyway anyway moving on

22:51.240 --> 22:54.080
yeah moving forward but this site is

22:54.080 --> 22:55.880
pretty cool and we know we need more

22:55.880 --> 23:00.900
stuff like this, I'm actually going to, as soon as I get an opportunity to send this

23:00.900 --> 23:08.220
guy a link to that article I found on Game Revolution, with the information provided

23:08.220 --> 23:15.140
from the FBI and Department of Justice showing the crime rate in youth going down since the

23:15.140 --> 23:16.140
release of the PS1.

23:16.140 --> 23:18.140
I think they need my benefit from that.

23:18.140 --> 23:19.140
Alright.

23:19.140 --> 23:22.300
Now, it's funny that we got an email from somebody named Jamie, because we also got

23:22.300 --> 23:25.180
an email from somebody named Rob.

23:25.180 --> 23:29.160
And I'm actually going to start with Rob's P.S. because he said kind of a nice thing

23:29.160 --> 23:31.140
here and I just want to repeat it.

23:31.140 --> 23:35.860
Rob said something about, sorry for delaying a podcast and listeners inquiring what went

23:35.860 --> 23:36.860
on.

23:36.860 --> 23:38.820
I appreciate your contribution to the video game media.

23:38.820 --> 23:41.780
Since it's free, I don't think I have any right to demand it.

23:41.780 --> 23:42.860
People should be more gracious.

23:42.860 --> 23:44.480
Well, that's really nice, Rob.

23:44.480 --> 23:45.480
We try our best.

23:45.480 --> 23:46.480
You're right.

23:46.480 --> 23:48.100
We don't get paid for this or anything.

23:48.100 --> 23:49.980
We just do this because we're bored.

23:49.980 --> 23:55.120
But no, we love games, so we do this because we can and we're glad that at least

23:55.120 --> 23:58.380
you know we're glad that just one person out there's listening let alone you know

23:58.380 --> 24:01.540
hundreds and hundreds of folks even now I think it is thousands of folks

24:01.540 --> 24:03.680
listening so it's just great thank you guys so much

24:03.680 --> 24:07.320
We really dig all of our listeners. We do it's awesome

24:07.320 --> 24:12.360
also he actually had a response to an article

24:12.360 --> 24:15.880
about virtual ethics which I thought was very interesting

24:15.880 --> 24:19.240
DarkSakura did you have any reports on like

24:19.240 --> 24:23.520
ethics going on like the mugging that's going on in games or anything?

24:23.520 --> 24:29.600
Well, just to give sort of a bit of the paraphrasing from this one article that he linked me to,

24:29.600 --> 24:34.400
a man was arrested in Japan on suspicion of carrying out a virtual mugging spree by using

24:34.400 --> 24:38.240
software bots to beat up and rob characters in the online game Lineage 2.

24:38.240 --> 24:40.240
I got to try that at E3 a couple of years ago.

24:40.240 --> 24:41.240
Hmm.

24:41.240 --> 24:42.240
That's what you do in that game.

24:42.240 --> 24:46.720
The stolen possessions, the virtual items, were exchanged for cash.

24:46.720 --> 24:53.440
It was a Chinese exchange student that was arrested for this in Kagawa.

24:53.440 --> 24:59.720
Several players had their characters beaten and robbed of valuable virtual objects, the

24:59.720 --> 25:02.720
name's items called Earring of Wisdom and Shield of Nightmare, I guess they're pretty

25:02.720 --> 25:09.560
big things in Lineage, but the items were fenced off through a Japanese auction website,

25:09.560 --> 25:14.320
according to NCSoft, that's the company that makes Lineage 2, and he did it by using a

25:14.320 --> 25:17.560
software bot, so it couldn't be beaten.

25:17.560 --> 25:19.520
Interesting, so there's always a way around this.

25:19.520 --> 25:22.120
Well, I want to read Rob's response to this.

25:22.120 --> 25:26.620
If you feel your character and stuff are worth paying blackmail, you seriously need a real

25:26.620 --> 25:27.620
life.

25:27.620 --> 25:32.040
Who knows, maybe the virtual mugging sent the victim home from the internet cafe early

25:32.040 --> 25:36.460
to inadvertently save the lives of himself and or his neglected offspring.

25:36.460 --> 25:38.560
Blackmail in real life is a serious crime.

25:38.560 --> 25:41.200
Virtual ethics had nothing to do with the perps arrest.

25:41.200 --> 25:44.380
One should seriously check themselves when they say virtual ethics.

25:44.380 --> 25:46.760
It literally means ethics that aren't real.

25:46.760 --> 25:54.760
Therefore, in the realm of actually having a real life, virtual ethics are inconsequential.

25:54.760 --> 25:55.760
Thank you.

25:55.760 --> 25:58.760
I finally got it there at the end.

25:58.760 --> 26:00.760
So, very interesting.

26:00.760 --> 26:04.760
Alright, that's going to do it for the mailbag, unless you have anything extra over there,

26:04.760 --> 26:05.760
DarkSakura.

26:05.760 --> 26:08.760
I think that was it, yes, for this week?

26:08.760 --> 26:15.760
I just, in regards to the virtual ethics thing, sad.

26:15.760 --> 26:23.760
for society. Actually, I did have another email actually that was linked to me.

26:23.760 --> 26:24.760
Sure.

26:24.760 --> 26:29.600
I'll just go ahead. It was an article that was within it. Unfortunately, I couldn't find

26:29.600 --> 26:37.120
the original one, but it's a little brief one. Going back to the game addiction business,

26:37.120 --> 26:43.480
a 28-year-old South Korean man died of exhaustion in an internet cafe after playing computer

26:43.480 --> 26:48.000
games non-stop for 49 hours.

26:48.000 --> 26:49.880
They only got his last name, Lee.

26:49.880 --> 26:55.840
He was a resident in the southern city of, I guess it's pronounced Ty-goo.

26:55.840 --> 26:59.800
He collapsed Friday after eating minimally and not sleeping, refusing to leave his keyboard

26:59.800 --> 27:03.160
while he played the battle simulation game, Starcraft.

27:03.160 --> 27:07.340
He was moved to a hospital but died a few hours later due to what the doctors are presuming

27:07.340 --> 27:08.720
was a heart attack.

27:08.720 --> 27:11.920
I swear I've heard this story before.

27:11.920 --> 27:15.940
Maybe not this exact same person, but I swear I've heard this exact same setup, internet

27:15.940 --> 27:19.940
cafe, person there playing their game too damn much, and dying from it.

27:19.940 --> 27:20.940
I swear I've heard this before.

27:20.940 --> 27:22.300
It happened a couple weeks ago.

27:22.300 --> 27:24.300
Somebody didn't get the hint the last time, apparently.

27:24.300 --> 27:29.260
Well actually, when I got the link on this, it was earlier within the week, and the time

27:29.260 --> 27:30.260
says five hours ago.

27:30.260 --> 27:31.260
Interesting.

27:31.260 --> 27:32.260
So it was fairly recent.

27:32.260 --> 27:36.200
They also said that he'd been fired from his job because he kept missing work to play computer

27:36.200 --> 27:37.200
games.

27:37.200 --> 27:38.200
Wow.

27:38.200 --> 27:40.180
So that's like, instead of drinking, he gamed.

27:40.180 --> 27:50.180
Yeah, and you know, if you look at it this way, for the people who are those hardcore addicts to booze,

27:50.180 --> 27:55.180
they're trying to escape from something that's gone wrong in their life.

27:55.180 --> 28:01.180
These people are using games in return to escape from the bad that's gone on in their life.

28:01.180 --> 28:07.180
How would an internet cafe allow you to be there for 48 hours straight?

28:07.180 --> 28:12.420
I mean, I know there's 24-hour cafes and everything, but isn't that an ethical business in the

28:12.420 --> 28:13.420
first place?

28:13.420 --> 28:16.540
I realize we're talking about another country, but I know they're making money, but at some

28:16.540 --> 28:18.180
point, don't you have to draw the line?

28:18.180 --> 28:19.940
You've got to sleep at some point.

28:19.940 --> 28:20.940
Hold on.

28:20.940 --> 28:26.220
When you go to a bar and the bartender sees that you've had one too many drinks, the bartender

28:26.220 --> 28:31.760
has a, I don't know if it's legal, I'm almost positive it is, but they have an ethical point

28:31.760 --> 28:34.300
to say, you know what, buddy, I can't serve you any more drinks.

28:34.300 --> 28:35.300
You're too drunk.

28:35.300 --> 28:38.980
I mean, one thing I need to point out that they've mentioned repeatedly in my business

28:38.980 --> 28:43.960
law class, ethics will change from country to country.

28:43.960 --> 28:45.680
And I, okay, I understand that.

28:45.680 --> 28:49.100
We're talking about another country here, we're not talking about the US, but still,

28:49.100 --> 28:54.900
I mean, I don't care where in the world you are, why didn't somebody stop this guy?

28:54.900 --> 28:57.440
This man was ultimately responsible for himself.

28:57.440 --> 28:58.440
I understand that.

28:58.440 --> 29:03.540
By all rights, they did not have, it's not their place to tell him how to live his life

29:03.540 --> 29:04.540
basically.

29:04.540 --> 29:11.220
But he was a paying customer if he chooses to pay with his life for that it really isn't there

29:11.220 --> 29:15.100
I mean, I made this may sound cold, but really isn't there concern. I understand that point

29:15.100 --> 29:16.900
I it is ultimately his fault

29:16.900 --> 29:22.140
but why didn't anybody his friend a loved one who noticed he was missing for 48 hours a

29:23.380 --> 29:30.180
Worker at the place who must have seen this going on nobody intervened and that's like not good Samaritan

29:30.180 --> 29:35.260
I know nobody should let anybody play Starcraft for that long. Anyway, I

29:36.620 --> 29:38.620
Saw that coming. I do

29:40.580 --> 29:46.780
Caught up in whatever your addiction is to the point you start, you know cutting out your friends your family

29:46.780 --> 29:53.780
You know, people are, you know, humans are humans, they're eventually going to give up.

29:53.780 --> 29:57.780
And ultimately, he paid for his price and I'm thinking about turning him over to the

29:57.780 --> 29:58.780
Darwin Awards.

29:58.780 --> 29:59.780
Seriously.

29:59.780 --> 30:02.460
Well, let us know what happens with that.

30:02.460 --> 30:06.860
You know, and I say the same thing about MMOs, like, you know, if you guys are out there

30:06.860 --> 30:11.900
and you're canceling your social life to stay in and play an MMO, you seriously got to question

30:11.900 --> 30:12.900
your priorities.

30:12.900 --> 30:13.900
Seriously.

30:13.900 --> 30:18.340
once in a great while it might be okay because you know you're not feeling up

30:18.340 --> 30:21.700
to it or whatever but if you notice yourself you're doing it repeatedly over

30:21.700 --> 30:24.400
and over again you're not going out and having a real life because you're

30:24.400 --> 30:29.240
staying in and playing video games of any nature really not just MMOs you got

30:29.240 --> 30:32.380
to get outdoors once in a while that's why we do our advice column which I

30:32.380 --> 30:40.060
guess is a good segue into that port portion of the show right really I

30:40.060 --> 30:45.060
I stayed out of school for a week to play Final Fantasy III, which was VI.

30:45.060 --> 30:48.060
But you didn't do that all the time, right?

30:48.060 --> 30:52.060
No, and I actually did legitimately develop the flu within that week.

30:52.060 --> 30:56.060
Oh, okay. Well, see, it's still a little extreme.

30:56.060 --> 30:58.060
I still might kind of raise my eyebrow at that and go,

30:58.060 --> 30:59.060
Jamie, you know, but...

30:59.060 --> 31:02.060
There's also the point that I was in high school.

31:02.060 --> 31:03.060
Right.

31:03.060 --> 31:05.060
I'm an adult now. That man was an adult.

31:05.060 --> 31:06.060
Right.

31:06.060 --> 31:07.060
There was no excuse.

31:07.060 --> 31:12.060
Yeah, and it's not like you do this every time a new game comes out, you know.

31:12.060 --> 31:13.060
Oh, hell no.

31:13.060 --> 31:17.060
I was an addict of Final Fantasy III in the US as well.

31:17.060 --> 31:20.060
I just bounce uncontrollably at work until I get to go home and play it.

31:20.060 --> 31:21.060
Right.

31:21.060 --> 31:24.060
Alright, let's get to tonight's advice column.

31:24.060 --> 31:31.060
Because, you know, if we just played video games all day long, we'd have no time to live.

31:31.060 --> 31:34.060
So DarkSakura is here to give us her advice column.

31:34.060 --> 31:37.060
DarkSakura, what is your advice about TONIGHT?

31:39.060 --> 31:44.060
Today's bit of advice is how to survive if you are in the line of fire if you are the primary target.

31:45.060 --> 31:49.060
You know, that means like, everyone else is wearing camo, you're wearing white.

31:50.060 --> 31:55.060
Number one, get as far away as possible, AKA run like hell.

31:56.060 --> 32:01.060
An untrained shooter is not likely to be accurate at any distance greater than 60 feet.

32:01.060 --> 32:13.060
2. Run fast, but do not move in a straight line. Weave back and forth. The average shooter will not have the training necessary to hit a moving target at any real distance.

32:13.060 --> 32:17.060
3. Turn a corner if possible. Well, duh.

32:17.060 --> 32:27.060
4. Do not bother to count shots. You will have no idea the shooter has more ammunition. Counting is only for the movies.

32:27.060 --> 32:29.660
My final bit of advice. Yes

32:36.860 --> 32:44.020
I think that's my favorite final piece of advice you've ever given on this program. Yes. Nice. Thank you. You getting shot at

32:45.020 --> 32:47.020
freaking shoot back

32:47.720 --> 32:49.720
Nice real nice

32:51.060 --> 32:53.060
Loki what else you get

32:53.060 --> 32:56.060
I'm so angry that they would make a mistake!

32:56.060 --> 32:59.060
Now go away before I taunt you a second time.

32:59.060 --> 33:02.060
Loki, what's going on in the hacking crack scene?

33:02.060 --> 33:04.060
Oh, there's tons of stuff.

33:04.060 --> 33:07.060
First off, there was a nice cel-shading demo that was released,

33:07.060 --> 33:12.060
kind of showing what homebrew stuff can do right now, which is kind of neat.

33:12.060 --> 33:19.060
And then also on top of that, looks like SanDisk was announcing that they're going to be releasing.

33:19.060 --> 33:24.260
2GB memory stick here pretty soon. So that's always good, especially for those people that

33:24.260 --> 33:31.060
are pirating stuff. Very cool. And also, which was really neat, someone made a game called

33:31.060 --> 33:39.420
NORT, which is a Tron light cycle racing game, you know, all those out there. And also, it

33:39.420 --> 33:45.060
was a good week if you are a music composer and you use a PSP because there's quite a

33:45.060 --> 34:10.060
few homebrew programs that were made. The first one being TI-MIDI. It's a MIDI playing program that's on the PSP, which was kind of interesting. There was a rhythm composer program being made, a PSP rhythm composer, and that's kind of like a drum machine type thing, which is interesting.

34:10.060 --> 34:18.060
Also, there was a program that was released called PSP-Tune, which helps you tune your guitar.

34:18.060 --> 34:22.060
So, very interesting stuff.

34:22.060 --> 34:35.060
On the DS end of things, there was also an update done to the Coleco Vision emulator, which is called Coleco DS, appropriately.

34:35.060 --> 34:40.860
and version 0.2 is released and they've got some interesting screenshots on

34:40.860 --> 34:42.460
ndsupdates.com

34:42.460 --> 34:47.100
so go check those out if you have some time. And that's all I've got so far.

34:47.100 --> 34:50.860
Alright, sounds good. You know it's funny you mention a lot of those music things

34:50.860 --> 34:52.300
going on because there's some big

34:52.300 --> 34:57.060
news this week for fans of music-based video games is of course we are here at

34:57.060 --> 34:59.100

34:59.100 --> 35:02.500
and what our three-hour program on Sunday nights is all about live on

35:08.180 --> 35:11.220
some early songs getting leaked

35:11.220 --> 35:14.300

35:14.300 --> 35:17.900
about a lot of the licensed songs it looks like we'll be looking at in the brand

35:17.900 --> 35:20.060
new DDR Xtreme 2 for PlayStation 2

35:20.060 --> 35:24.780

35:24.780 --> 35:28.140
including La Copa Da Vida from

35:28.140 --> 35:31.220

35:31.220 --> 35:36.620

including Spin Spin Sugar by The Sneaker Pimps,

35:59.860 --> 36:03.380
Silence by Delirium with Sarah McLachlan.

36:03.380 --> 36:07.180
Also, we have Block Rockin' Beats by the Chemical Brothers

36:07.180 --> 36:10.940
and As the Rush Comes from Motorcycle. And that's just a short list.

36:10.940 --> 36:14.260
Oh, also Get Busy by Sean Paul. That's kind of a neat little song.

36:14.260 --> 36:19.460
The full list, of course, is available on our website www.orangeloungeradio.com.

36:19.460 --> 36:23.740
Also making an announcement this week, Karaoke Revolution Party.

36:23.740 --> 36:26.980
Whole lot of songs in karaoke revolution party edition

36:27.720 --> 36:29.720
My gosh take on me

36:29.800 --> 36:31.800
material girl me and Bobby McGee

36:32.480 --> 36:33.680

36:33.680 --> 36:40.040
Do you really want to hurt me call me American woman? I could read this list all day. It's huge check it out

36:40.040 --> 36:45.040
OrangeLawnTrader.com that's going to be karaoke revolution party edition coming out a little later this year

36:46.560 --> 36:51.600
Konami's also announcing sweet code and tactics which is going to be coming out for the PlayStation 2

36:51.600 --> 36:57.220
2. Of course, you could think of this as kind of like Final Fantasy Tactics, but... Sweet

36:57.220 --> 37:01.160
Golden Tactics! The official announcement came out this week that it will be coming

37:01.160 --> 37:07.160
out for the PlayStation 2. We're looking at a Spring 2006 release date for this game.

37:07.160 --> 37:12.360
Okay, did you... you remember Advent Rising, that game that was... came out for the Xbox

37:12.360 --> 37:15.780
recently? You know how they had that million dollar competition that was going on? Win

37:15.780 --> 37:20.200
a million dollars by playing Advent Rising? Yeah. Called off! The competition has been

37:20.200 --> 37:27.200
called off due to too many bugs going on with the game, or basically also they're saying

37:27.200 --> 37:32.440
too many bugs, too many things going wrong in the system, they have quietly cancelled

37:32.440 --> 37:33.580
the million dollar giveaway.

37:33.580 --> 37:35.080
That happened earlier this week.

37:35.080 --> 37:40.380
Instead, as kind of a consolation prize, each person who participated in the Race to Save

37:40.380 --> 37:45.440
Humanity contest will receive two free games from its recent catalog.

37:45.440 --> 37:49.920
Not too bad of a consolation prize when you consider that the games you can choose from

37:49.920 --> 37:56.540
Blood Rain 2, Guilty Gear X2 Reload, Psychonauts, Raze as Hell, and Phantom Dust.

37:56.540 --> 37:59.560
So there's quite a few good games in that catalog there.

37:59.560 --> 38:04.840
Too bad though about that million dollar competition because they stand to be paying that much

38:04.840 --> 38:06.320
out in all these free games.

38:06.320 --> 38:09.060
I don't know how many people were in this contest.

38:09.060 --> 38:12.280
This really wasn't a game that appealed to me personally, but I just think it's interesting

38:12.280 --> 38:14.040
that the contest had to be called off.

38:14.040 --> 38:16.640
It was a cool game, but it did have its fair share of bugs.

38:16.640 --> 38:18.520
Yeah, it's too bad.

38:18.520 --> 38:19.520
Alright.

38:19.520 --> 38:26.040
Um, also, I want to point this out, World of Warcraft, you know this, the MMO, the most

38:26.040 --> 38:33.880
popular MMO, which none of us play here on this program, I actually, I have a friend

38:33.880 --> 38:37.480
that's really trying to get me into it too, I've tried to install it, and my computer

38:37.480 --> 38:40.760
won't accept the installation for some reason, which makes no sense to me.

38:40.760 --> 38:41.760
It's like, no!

38:41.760 --> 38:42.760
No, I don't want this!

38:42.760 --> 38:47.720
already put enough crappy MMOs on me so I'm trying to make it work so we will

38:47.720 --> 38:52.520
soon be reporting from inside World of Warcraft at some point hopefully but we

38:52.520 --> 38:57.280
did want to point out upper deck entertainment what is upper deck well

38:57.280 --> 39:02.920
known for card cards that's right they are making a they are making a trading

39:02.920 --> 39:09.680
card game based out of World of Warcraft the quote from Jerry Benton senior vice

39:09.680 --> 39:13.800
president of Upper Deck Entertainment, the World of Warcraft trading card game will perfectly

39:13.800 --> 39:18.700
capture all of the action-packed combat and furious competition that online players have

39:18.700 --> 39:19.700
come to expect.

39:19.700 --> 39:20.700
Will there be a slash...

39:20.700 --> 39:22.180
Oh, wait, no, that's EverQuest II.

39:22.180 --> 39:23.420
That's EverQuest II.

39:23.420 --> 39:24.420
Slash pizza card.

39:24.420 --> 39:25.420
That'd be sweet.

39:25.420 --> 39:26.420
Maybe the pizza card.

39:26.420 --> 39:31.460
You know, actually, I think it was in World of Warcraft, there's slash chicken you can

39:31.460 --> 39:37.260
do, and you can do this little quest where you can get a chicken to follow you around.

39:37.260 --> 39:38.260
Interesting.

39:38.260 --> 39:39.260
Very interesting.

39:39.260 --> 39:43.900
Xbox 360, this is actually really big news, we're hitting it kind of late in the podcast,

39:43.900 --> 39:45.260
my bad.

39:45.260 --> 39:52.700
Prices were announced this week for the Xbox 360, very interesting, $299.99 US for the

39:52.700 --> 39:53.700
basic unit.

39:53.700 --> 39:56.440
I don't know why they just don't say 300 bucks, because that's what you're going to be paying

39:56.440 --> 39:58.220
after tax, 300 bucks.

39:58.220 --> 40:04.080
So for 300 bucks, you're going to get the Xbox 360 console, the controller, which is

40:04.080 --> 40:06.980
a wired controller, but it has an extended nine foot cable.

40:06.980 --> 40:10.360
Which I didn't understand anyways because there's no freaking controller ports on there

40:10.360 --> 40:16.220
So where you plug it in? They're all now a new game find the controller for a USB port maybe and whatever

40:16.220 --> 40:22.440
Huh, maybe gotcha. All right an Xbox 360 faceplate and an Xbox 360

40:23.220 --> 40:27.560
Standard AV cable. All right composite. Yeah, so that's the first one

40:28.500 --> 40:30.500
now if you want a

40:31.260 --> 40:33.620
$400 or as they say three ninety nine ninety nine

40:33.620 --> 40:39.620
That's just $400 and that first set the first one was actually called the Xbox 360 core. Yes

40:39.620 --> 40:43.000
That's just the Xbox 360 basically now. This is the premium edition

40:44.120 --> 40:45.700
400 bucks

40:45.700 --> 40:47.700
console hard drive

40:48.060 --> 40:55.580
20 gigabytes yes, ladies and gentlemen the Xbox 360 will not have a hard drive built in by default like the original Xbox did

40:55.580 --> 40:57.580
You know what I'm doing. I'm gonna take that friggin hard drive

40:57.580 --> 41:02.700
I'm ripping apart and put 120 gig hard drive in there screw that 20 gig crap for the $400

41:02.700 --> 41:10.560
you get the wireless controller, the faceplate, a headset, a component high definition cable,

41:10.560 --> 41:18.300
so you, well let me get to that thought, Xbox Live silver, yes, an Xbox Live silver membership,

41:18.300 --> 41:21.080
and a bonus media remote.

41:21.080 --> 41:26.020
So basically, those of you guys that are HDTV owners like myself now, I just bought one

41:26.020 --> 41:30.320
not that long ago and Jamie I know has got one, you're pretty much screwed because once

41:30.320 --> 41:37.640
Once you buy the $300 Xbox and the correct cable, you're gonna be paying $400 as it is.

41:37.640 --> 41:45.360
So it seems to me that this $300 leftovers pack is kind of trying to soften the blow

41:45.360 --> 41:48.920
of the fact that the system really costs $400 for everything you want.

41:48.920 --> 41:49.920
Yeah, what they're...

41:49.920 --> 41:53.320
I'm thinking what people are gonna do is be buying that when the third party stuff starts

41:53.320 --> 41:54.320
coming out.

41:54.320 --> 41:55.320
Possibly.

41:55.320 --> 42:12.320
You don't have to buy a hard drive, you can buy this stupid little 64 meg memory card thing, and you don't have to buy a wireless controller, I mean, it's just nice, and you don't have to have a headset, and guess what, you know, the Xbox Live Silver package, that's free, so that's not really a big...

42:12.320 --> 42:21.320
Well that actually is packaged in on the regular one too, I know it didn't make the story here on the site, but I read it somewhere else that the Xbox Live Silver will be on both sets, so at least you get that.

42:21.320 --> 42:22.320
What would you do?

42:22.320 --> 42:28.020
What strikes me as interesting though, okay, I maybe understand why they omitted the hard drive from the Xbox 360,

42:28.020 --> 42:31.620
because honestly, how often did you use it with the original Xbox?

42:31.620 --> 42:36.820
Granted, you could load your own songs, but how many games really supported that? Not a lot.

42:36.820 --> 42:43.120
I don't know, we put on a bunch of Initial D soundtracks for, what was it, Midnight Club or something?

42:43.120 --> 42:46.620
Yeah, but not a lot of games supported it.

42:46.620 --> 42:48.220
I mean, a few, but not a lot.

42:48.220 --> 42:51.820
and it's not like you could, a lot of games

42:51.820 --> 42:56.460
use the hard drive for their data, I mean it's saved but nothing that a memory card

42:56.460 --> 42:59.100
wouldn't be able to fit unless you're a real hardcore gamer

42:59.100 --> 43:05.060
but now I'm thinking okay but now you're also talking with Xbox 360 that

43:05.060 --> 43:07.660
Final Fantasy 11 is one of your big titles

43:07.660 --> 43:11.800
you have to have a hard drive for Final Fantasy 11 because of all the freaking patches they do

43:11.800 --> 43:15.460
so if you want to play Final Fantasy 11, Sony had their hand in that little decision

43:15.460 --> 43:17.460
Yeah, well, yeah, most likely so

43:18.420 --> 43:20.420
Just very interesting there that

43:21.220 --> 43:25.700
Really to play all the really big games. You're gonna have to check down the $400 anyway

43:25.700 --> 43:30.900
I suppose maybe if you just want you just want Madden, you know, you're just a light gamer

43:30.900 --> 43:37.540
Maybe the $300 one will do you but most people that listen to this program probably consider themselves hardcore enough where?

43:37.900 --> 43:39.900
That $300 set just doesn't cut it

43:40.340 --> 43:41.740
so

43:41.740 --> 43:46.440
Very interesting a dark soccer any other thoughts on that. Oh, yeah

43:46.440 --> 43:47.800
I know I'm gonna have to get the premium

43:47.800 --> 43:51.720
I have to I want the HD cables and I want the wireless controller and the hard drive

43:51.840 --> 43:55.400
So I have to check down the $400, but I'm just kind of

43:57.920 --> 44:05.360
Well, I guess but $400 is still a lot of money but I suppose most systems were around $400 when they first came out anyway, so

44:06.680 --> 44:11.280
Did you know that they lost a lot of money when the Xbox first came out? Yeah

44:11.280 --> 44:15.620
I think this is a way for them to make something that looks a little bit more affordable and

44:15.620 --> 44:20.860
attractive for the casual gamer or for someone who doesn't have a lot of money or doesn't

44:20.860 --> 44:25.460
have, you know, the high definition setup you or I have.

44:25.460 --> 44:29.600
It makes it a little bit more affordable, makes it a little bit more attractive, and

44:29.600 --> 44:34.720
then for those of us who have all this stuff who would lay down that kind of money, you

44:34.720 --> 44:37.800
know, they're like, hey, we've got some goodies for you, we'll save you some money.

44:37.800 --> 44:41.400
I suppose what makes some of us angsty out there is that we're looking at this

44:41.400 --> 44:41.840
going,

44:41.840 --> 44:46.200
aw man, you mean we gotta pay a hundred dollars for the stuff we need anyway

44:46.200 --> 44:49.720
as gamers? I think that's where we kinda feel like, aw

44:49.720 --> 44:53.100
jeez, we're being nickeled and dimed again. But I understand what you're saying. By

44:53.100 --> 44:54.640
having the three hundred dollar set,

44:54.640 --> 44:58.000
it makes Xbox 360 more accessible,

44:58.000 --> 45:02.000
so to speak, to a broader game audience. Those folks that, you know, they just want

45:02.000 --> 45:03.200
the new Madden game or,

45:03.200 --> 45:06.880
you know, whatever it is. I think it's a really smart move on

45:06.880 --> 45:08.560
on Microsoft's part, I really do.

45:08.560 --> 45:10.680
Well, we shall see when the sales figures come out,

45:10.680 --> 45:12.000
shall we?

45:12.000 --> 45:14.040
Oh, yes, I will be paying attention to that.

45:14.040 --> 45:20.920
I read a really neat article in Time about the 360.

45:20.920 --> 45:24.880
This article came out about the time that we were all at E3.

45:24.880 --> 45:28.440
I'm just saying about how much money they lost on it.

45:28.440 --> 45:31.000
With the design of the system, they

45:31.000 --> 45:33.120
designed something that would be attractive

45:33.120 --> 45:35.400
to the Japanese market as well.

45:35.400 --> 45:38.720
now i'd love to see if they're going to be doing the same thing there that they

45:38.720 --> 45:41.600
are here

45:41.600 --> 45:42.760
what's that

45:42.760 --> 45:46.120
about having the multiple packages

45:46.120 --> 45:49.420
okay the with and without package basically

45:49.420 --> 45:50.020
we'll see

45:50.020 --> 45:52.840
we gotta move on let's get to some more stories uh... loki you got anything else for us?

45:52.840 --> 45:55.920
yeah speaking of xbox 360 there's a

45:55.920 --> 45:56.800
some of

45:56.800 --> 45:58.360
few little things here

45:58.360 --> 46:00.680
one of them is this new

46:00.680 --> 46:05.120
webpage that's just appeared online and this webpage is

46:05.120 --> 46:09.060
xbox or its origin xbox

46:09.060 --> 46:10.880
three sixty dot com

46:10.880 --> 46:14.380
what's interesting is there's a new timer counting down there was also

46:14.380 --> 46:15.680
interesting is

46:15.680 --> 46:19.700
that the domain was registered by microsoft

46:19.700 --> 46:22.180
so it is in another one of those big like you know when

46:22.180 --> 46:26.320
we like bees or whatever that site was called

46:26.320 --> 46:31.440
possibly uh... the website by you know people looking at it they figured out

46:31.440 --> 46:32.740
that's gonna end

46:32.740 --> 46:33.760
on

46:33.760 --> 46:42.600
September 27th, I believe at 12 Eastern, and no one really knows what the hell it is, they

46:42.600 --> 46:44.260
just know that it's a countdown thing.

46:44.260 --> 46:49.000
It's got this, kind of a picture of a tree, and it's cut out of a bunny, and it looks

46:49.000 --> 46:51.840
like Xbox 360 will have bunny love.

46:51.840 --> 46:53.520
Ah, bunnies.

46:53.520 --> 46:58.160
No, but that's their answer to Nintendogs.

46:58.160 --> 47:01.860
Micro bunnies.

47:01.860 --> 47:02.860
That's it.

47:02.860 --> 47:07.160
now but you know something like that could actually happen. You know something like that

47:07.160 --> 47:10.640
could actually happen. It will be there answered in Nintendogs. It will be micro bunnies. Yeah,

47:10.640 --> 47:14.640
you micro bunnies. You walk, you turn around, you walk away, you get something to drink,

47:14.640 --> 47:19.580
you come back, there's 400 of them on the screen. And what are we going to get next,

47:19.580 --> 47:27.060
play cats? Oh god, anyway, so there's some weird site and it's basically you can access

47:27.060 --> 47:37.580
it at www.origin and this is o-r-i-g-n-x-box-360.com and you've got the countdown here you can

47:37.580 --> 47:45.420
go check it out figure out what it's about who knows kind of weird but anyways then on

47:45.420 --> 47:52.620
to the subject of something else which would be the nintendo d or actually nintendo revolution

47:52.620 --> 47:59.820
There has been a comment made by Peter Mullinux at Lionhead Studios, the guy, or the studio

47:59.820 --> 48:07.500
behind Black and White and Fable, and he's basically quizzed at the, at some European

48:07.500 --> 48:13.700
games convention about the revolution, and he's basically said this, and this is his

48:13.700 --> 48:19.540
quote, there is a line at the end of the book, game over, and it is, never underestimate

48:19.540 --> 48:25.840
Nintendo that is all I can say about the controller hmm things that make you go

48:25.840 --> 48:29.680
hmm basically you know what it's been the same thing from all these other

48:29.680 --> 48:33.040
different publishers have been looking at they're like I can't say anything

48:33.040 --> 48:38.360
under strict you know NDR but don't count them out interesting so we'll have

48:38.360 --> 48:41.880
to wait till the end of the year to find out you know the Nintendo's kind of been

48:41.880 --> 48:47.940
with the DS they kind of changed the controller a little bit because the

48:47.940 --> 48:51.380
controller is a pen and you never really saw that in a gaming system before so

48:51.380 --> 48:54.460
Nintendo's kind of been on this kick lately so it'll be very interesting to

48:54.460 --> 48:57.020
see what happens

48:57.020 --> 49:03.860
God no power glove it's so bad all right anything else you got for us

49:03.860 --> 49:09.940
tonight Loki and finally yes happy birthday to you happy birthday Mario

49:09.940 --> 49:17.020
you're 20 Wow he's still young and yeah he's got a lot to learn Nintendo has

49:17.020 --> 49:21.420
officially launched the Mario's happy birthday site,

49:21.420 --> 49:26.900
nintendo.co.jp slash mario20th.

49:26.900 --> 49:29.140
And on behalf of Orange Lounge Radio,

49:29.140 --> 49:30.940
we'd like to apologize to Mario.

49:30.940 --> 49:35.900
We are sorry, but your cake is in another castle.

49:35.900 --> 49:37.100
I kill me.

49:37.100 --> 49:39.540
It's a mushroom cake.

49:39.540 --> 49:42.020
Digdug is coming to the DS.

49:42.020 --> 49:44.020
We mentioned this on the show a little bit ago,

49:44.020 --> 49:46.540
but now they're releasing a little bit more information

49:46.540 --> 49:52.500
about this game. It's Dig Dug Digging Strike. It's going to be an update of the 82 game

49:52.500 --> 49:58.060
Dig Dug. It will be coming out this fall, says Namco. The DS game will have the original

49:58.060 --> 50:02.380
character from Dig Dug and will also have updated gameplay that takes advantage of the

50:02.380 --> 50:07.500
dual screens on the handheld. It'll actually be coming out in September. Dig Dug, oh you

50:07.500 --> 50:12.940
know the release date for this? It's mid-September. Dig Dug is armed with a collection of weapons

50:12.940 --> 50:18.420
such as rocks, lava, and quicksand to defeat the baddies that are in his way.

50:18.420 --> 50:20.220
So that should be interesting.

50:20.220 --> 50:21.220
Also multiplayer.

50:21.220 --> 50:23.940
This is junior assistant Mr. Driller.

50:23.940 --> 50:27.540
They are saying multiplayer, two players, in this game.

50:27.540 --> 50:28.540
So it should be interesting.

50:28.540 --> 50:30.280
That'll be really cool.

50:30.280 --> 50:31.280
Did you have any other stories for us tonight?

50:31.280 --> 50:32.280
I happen to have that.

50:32.280 --> 50:33.280
I'm sorry?

50:33.280 --> 50:41.460
I have to have that game actually, I picked up Dig Dug for the Atari 7800 today.

50:41.460 --> 50:48.060
DS is more than making up for kind of a light early 2005 with a lot of great games in late

50:48.060 --> 50:49.660
2005, so I forgive them.

50:49.660 --> 50:52.900
I still do not forgive them for the Zelda delay, however.

50:52.900 --> 50:55.300
Did you have any other stories for us tonight, Dark Sakura?

50:55.300 --> 50:56.300
Nope.

50:56.300 --> 50:57.300
Okay.

50:57.300 --> 50:59.140
Then I've only got a couple more left here.

50:59.140 --> 51:03.260
These are kind of the WTF stories.

51:03.260 --> 51:04.860
Core Hotels.

51:04.860 --> 51:09.220
This is a hotel chain in Southern California, and it's one of those like really swanky hotel

51:09.220 --> 51:10.220
things.

51:10.220 --> 51:16.240
a PlayStation 2 and PSP basically what it is is that you if you stay in their

51:16.240 --> 51:22.520
rooms you get free use of a PSP handheld or a PlayStation 2 get this each hotel

51:22.520 --> 51:27.160
has a resident game butler who helps you install and use the systems how would

51:27.160 --> 51:31.440
that be for a job being the game butler one of these hotels very interesting by

51:31.440 --> 51:34.640
the way if you're me yeah if you're thinking that this is a good way to

51:34.640 --> 51:39.000
check out one of these systems think again because staying at core hotels

51:39.000 --> 51:43.440
will cost you well over several hundred dollars per night so you might as well

51:43.440 --> 51:50.760
just buy yourself a PlayStation 2 or a PSP. I can top that. Oh? What do you have?

51:50.760 --> 51:57.320
It's just been announced that... I've got one more story and it's all right no no

51:57.320 --> 52:02.160
I want to save mine for last because mine's great you read yours. Well you

52:02.160 --> 52:07.800
know Nokia will just try anything to get their product out there so Nokia to

52:07.800 --> 52:14.720
Combat, you know the PSP being a hotel. They have the Nokia engage deck chair. That's right folks the engage deck chair

52:15.280 --> 52:19.280
What you can do basically is they're gonna be putting these out at

52:20.160 --> 52:22.560
different venues out there and

52:24.120 --> 52:27.920
What's gonna happen is is they're actually gonna be sitting I

52:28.760 --> 52:33.280
Honestly like a chair with a chair with a crappy umbrella attached to it

52:33.280 --> 52:37.280
And this crappy N-Gage attached to it, it looks like crap.

52:37.280 --> 52:39.960
It's just, it's going to be touring a number of festivals,

52:39.960 --> 52:47.760
including Carlene Leeds and Reading Festival and whatever.

52:47.760 --> 52:51.160
Honestly, folks, it's going to suck.

52:51.160 --> 52:54.000
The last desperate attempt of a desperate company.

52:54.000 --> 52:56.120
Even the deck chair looks uncomfortable.

52:56.120 --> 52:58.240
It's like the deck chair was put together wrong.

52:58.240 --> 52:58.760
You know what's funny?

52:58.760 --> 53:02.760
I went to IHOP today, and I saw somebody playing an N-Gage.

53:02.760 --> 53:06.600
and that's probably only the second time I have ever seen somebody playing an

53:06.600 --> 53:09.600
N-Gage. Their parents don't love them. No, it was like an adult.

53:09.600 --> 53:12.680
Like an upper-twenties looking guy.

53:12.680 --> 53:16.180
And it's probably only the second time I've ever seen somebody playing an N-Gage, like not

53:16.180 --> 53:19.480
in a GameStop demo or something. Crazy.

53:19.480 --> 53:22.800
You know what, in the N-Gage's defense,

53:22.800 --> 53:26.560
a system is only as good as the games that are on it.

53:26.560 --> 53:29.560
Unfortunately it doesn't really have any good games anyway.

53:29.560 --> 53:33.720
yeah all right now dark soccer you tell me which story was better Loki's final

53:33.720 --> 53:35.120
story or my final story

53:35.120 --> 53:40.580
Linda Carter will be joining the cast of Elder Scrolls 4

53:40.580 --> 53:46.240
Linda Carter yes that's right Linda Carter best known as Wonder Woman

53:46.240 --> 53:50.700
or should I say Wonder Woman is going to be joining the cast of this game Elder

53:50.700 --> 53:51.560
Scrolls 4

53:51.560 --> 53:54.600
and what else do you really need to know about the game

53:54.600 --> 53:57.520
I mean seriously it's got Wonder Woman in it who cares

53:57.520 --> 54:01.320
all right fine it's freaking awesome it's it's

54:01.320 --> 54:04.240
it's you know a role-playing game basically um

54:04.240 --> 54:07.360
it you're in this fantasy realm of Tamriel

54:07.360 --> 54:10.840
where the gates to a hellish underworld are going to be opened and

54:10.840 --> 54:14.600
but never fear Wonder Woman is here! but never fear Wonder Woman's here with her

54:14.600 --> 54:16.520
golden lasso

54:16.520 --> 54:19.840
all right you know what

54:19.840 --> 54:24.520
Wonder Woman was created by the guy who invented the

54:24.520 --> 54:28.600
the lie detector. I've heard that story before.

54:28.600 --> 54:31.880
And the golden lasso is a

54:31.880 --> 54:35.400
sort of a nod to his invention. That's great.

54:35.400 --> 54:38.900
Of course he was also into bondage, which explains other things.

54:38.900 --> 54:42.520
And of course there's the upcoming Wonder Woman movie that's

54:42.520 --> 54:46.120
going to be directed by the guy who did Buffy and Serenity and all that stuff,

54:46.120 --> 54:49.720
but that's for another podcast. Wait, is it directed by or is it written by?

54:49.720 --> 54:52.760
I believe... Written by Joss.

54:52.760 --> 54:58.760
Don't send me hate mail if I'm wrong, but I believe it's written and directed by the one and only Jaws.

54:58.760 --> 55:04.760
That means it's going to be done fabulously well. He was also writing X-Men for a little while.

55:04.760 --> 55:06.760
And it was being done very well.

55:06.760 --> 55:11.760
We'll save that to the Buffy fans podcast. If there is one, I would think there's got to be a Buffy podcast out there.

55:11.760 --> 55:13.760
I'm going to go look for one right now.

55:13.760 --> 55:15.760
That sounds like a waste of time.

55:15.760 --> 55:22.920
It's time for the final thoughts before DarkSakura jumps through the skype line and strangles

55:22.920 --> 55:25.200
Loki for knocking Buffy.

55:25.200 --> 55:26.200
Loki your final thought.

55:26.200 --> 55:31.760
Did that guy actually come up with the really retarded concept of an invisible flying jet?

55:31.760 --> 55:32.760
Yep.

55:32.760 --> 55:36.080
Why couldn't he just make her fly?

55:36.080 --> 55:39.360
An invisible jet is retarded.

55:39.360 --> 55:41.480
Because she's an Amazon or something.

55:41.480 --> 55:43.680
Oh so she can't fly.

55:43.680 --> 55:46.320
She's a woman, that's why she can't fly.

55:46.320 --> 55:47.320
Hey!

55:47.320 --> 55:50.480
She has some fly jets.

55:50.480 --> 55:51.480
She's going to punch you next week.

55:51.480 --> 55:53.560
I'm just saying that because I'm not there.

55:53.560 --> 55:59.160
My final thought is, my final thought is Nintendogs, you are mine this week, finally.

55:59.160 --> 56:02.280
Oh god, it's going to be a really bad show next week.

56:02.280 --> 56:04.680
It's always a really bad show, what are you talking about?

56:04.680 --> 56:06.240
But you guys listen anyway, we love you.

56:06.240 --> 56:09.800
DarkSakura, your final thought?

56:09.800 --> 56:11.240
Reject false icons.

56:11.240 --> 56:12.240
Alright.

56:12.240 --> 56:18.200
That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio To Go, thanks you guys

56:18.200 --> 56:20.200
