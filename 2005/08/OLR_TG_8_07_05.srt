00:00:00,529 --> 00:00:04,432
[SPEAKER_00]: Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of August 8th.

2
00:00:07,633 --> 00:00:15,578
[SPEAKER_01]: You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.

3
00:00:15,838 --> 00:00:19,520
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.

4
00:00:20,981 --> 00:00:23,883
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to another edition of Orange Lounge Radio To Go.

5
00:00:24,503 --> 00:00:28,826
[SPEAKER_03]: I am Loki, and with us tonight we have the lovely DarkSakura.

6
00:00:29,983 --> 00:00:32,204
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, hello.

7
00:00:55,663 --> 00:01:00,226
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to start everything off how Sky normally does it with how was your gaming week?

8
00:01:00,626 --> 00:01:02,468
[SPEAKER_03]: So Jamie, what did you play this week?

9
00:01:03,949 --> 00:01:07,251
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than widescreen Pong, which actually I didn't play this week.

10
00:01:07,351 --> 00:01:11,514
[SPEAKER_00]: I played some PSO, looked at some games.

11
00:01:11,554 --> 00:01:15,576
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually have Rob's birthday present here that I finally got my hands on.

12
00:01:16,137 --> 00:01:18,478
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that he was wanting, but I'll let him talk about that next week.

13
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:25,443
[SPEAKER_00]: Mainly, I've been trying to get stuff together because I start school next week, plus I have an announcement.

14
00:01:27,305 --> 00:01:27,905
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the announcement?

15
00:01:28,606 --> 00:01:31,927
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting married on September 1st, so I've been sort of busy doing wedding stuff.

16
00:01:32,327 --> 00:01:34,228
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, they don't have wedding planner at the game.

17
00:01:34,728 --> 00:01:35,028
[SPEAKER_00]: Not yet.

18
00:01:37,209 --> 00:01:37,969
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, that's pretty soon.

19
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:40,010
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

20
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:43,151
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this week I played quite a bit, actually.

21
00:01:43,691 --> 00:01:47,753
[SPEAKER_03]: I started off the week with beating Star Soldier on the PSP, which is fun.

22
00:01:48,353 --> 00:01:49,594
[SPEAKER_03]: So now I'm done with that.

23
00:01:50,534 --> 00:01:55,556
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I actually played We Love Katamari, the Japanese version, so that was really nice.

24
00:01:56,278 --> 00:01:57,299
[SPEAKER_03]: I've played that.

25
00:01:57,339 --> 00:01:58,839
[SPEAKER_03]: I've played that and it's kind of crap.

26
00:01:58,859 --> 00:01:59,240
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

27
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,360
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was kind of fun, but...

28
00:02:21,309 --> 00:02:22,150
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just weird like that.

29
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:29,113
[SPEAKER_03]: Then also, I was able to play, let's see, Burnout 3.

30
00:02:29,233 --> 00:02:31,694
[SPEAKER_03]: That game is so much fucking fun.

31
00:02:31,714 --> 00:02:38,217
[SPEAKER_03]: It's definitely worth the best racing game of the year.

32
00:02:38,297 --> 00:02:39,177
[SPEAKER_03]: That G4 2005, they said, you know.

33
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,901
[SPEAKER_03]: Great games, just like an arcade racing game.

34
00:02:43,981 --> 00:02:45,281
[SPEAKER_03]: You can smash through everything.

35
00:02:45,542 --> 00:02:47,182
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really, really, really fun.

36
00:02:47,202 --> 00:02:48,363
[SPEAKER_03]: I cannot stress how fun it is.

37
00:02:49,203 --> 00:02:50,963
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to play some In the Groove this week.

38
00:02:52,504 --> 00:02:53,925
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, we know how that is.

39
00:02:54,165 --> 00:02:59,206
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's basically about as bad as I thought it was.

40
00:02:59,547 --> 00:03:03,828
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm glad you know that I was renting it and not buying it.

41
00:03:04,588 --> 00:03:08,270
[SPEAKER_03]: And I actually got to try out a little bit of Genji.

42
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:19,663
[SPEAKER_03]: which is pretty cool, Japanese I can't understand it, and Namco X Capcom, which has one of the most kickass anime intros I've ever seen for a game, so really cool.

43
00:03:20,885 --> 00:03:21,325
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways...

44
00:03:23,334 --> 00:03:28,256
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I was going to try that one game that was suggested to me by one of our listeners.

45
00:03:29,616 --> 00:03:34,257
[SPEAKER_00]: However, again, with this week being as hectic as it was, I haven't got a chance, although I've started the download on it.

46
00:03:34,317 --> 00:03:44,761
[SPEAKER_00]: But another one of our listeners has pointed me in the direction of another game that I'm going to be giving a try sometime this week as well that's along the same lines.

47
00:03:44,781 --> 00:03:45,841
[SPEAKER_00]: It's supposed to be pretty cool.

48
00:03:47,944 --> 00:03:49,905
[SPEAKER_03]: All good things come from Florida.

49
00:04:10,569 --> 00:04:15,110
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, we've got Jack Thompson coming after Killer7 now.

50
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:32,075
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically, his quote is, There is no question in my mind that a video game containing full-blown sex sequences cannot be rated anything other than adults only, rather than M. The full-blown sex sequences are no more than you could see in an R-rated movie.

51
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:45,908
[SPEAKER_03]: But for those who aren't keeping tally, Jack Thompson was the guy that actually brought this whole hot coffee thing to the table and blew it way out of proportion, like everything, and just is coming after yet more games.

52
00:04:46,848 --> 00:04:49,248
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, he's the lead asshole in charge of the brigade.

53
00:04:50,269 --> 00:04:51,629
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, he sucks.

54
00:04:52,249 --> 00:05:00,591
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically, he actually did an interview on Chatterbox Video Game Radio, basically bitching about different things, and including...

55
00:05:01,321 --> 00:05:07,665
[SPEAKER_03]: How he says Will Wright wants Electronic Arts to collaborate with the porn industry to allow wholesale modification of their game, Sims 2.

56
00:05:08,825 --> 00:05:10,747
[SPEAKER_03]: Because of this whole third-party porn thing.

57
00:05:10,807 --> 00:05:14,929
[SPEAKER_03]: Which, by the way, has nothing to do with EA's game in the first place.

58
00:05:15,169 --> 00:05:18,251
[SPEAKER_03]: This is completely like some perverted people out there making mods.

59
00:05:18,271 --> 00:05:25,535
[SPEAKER_03]: Because Sims 2 allows you to actually make third-party mods, including brand new clothing, skins, and furniture and whatnot.

60
00:05:26,515 --> 00:05:29,037
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, you know there's going to be somebody out there that's going to make a nude skin.

61
00:05:30,157 --> 00:05:35,901
[SPEAKER_03]: So, he's blaming them, saying, oh, well, you know, because you're allowing modification in the game, you're to blame for this crap.

62
00:05:36,762 --> 00:05:37,382
[SPEAKER_03]: It's retarded.

63
00:05:37,902 --> 00:05:40,144
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, extremely retarded, this guy is.

64
00:05:40,884 --> 00:05:44,267
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish we could get him on our show so I could punch him in the face, but, you know, that's just me.

65
00:05:45,047 --> 00:05:47,369
[SPEAKER_03]: But, the other thing.

66
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:47,928
[SPEAKER_03]: and so on.

67
00:06:06,149 --> 00:06:10,231
[SPEAKER_03]: We actually have anti-bullying groups coming out to Rockstar about this game saying they shouldn't be released.

68
00:06:10,511 --> 00:06:12,212
[SPEAKER_03]: And they have a list of demands.

69
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:17,754
[SPEAKER_03]: A list of demands that they basically wanted them to donate money to this anti-bullying fund.

70
00:06:18,074 --> 00:06:21,755
[SPEAKER_03]: They're saying that games like Grand Theft Auto and stuff actually raise insurance rates.

71
00:06:22,056 --> 00:06:26,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Just throwing out all these bogus, weird claims that mean nothing.

72
00:06:26,197 --> 00:06:27,638
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just groundless.

73
00:06:28,772 --> 00:06:44,000
[SPEAKER_00]: They obviously haven't read, like I brought up last week, about the FBI's reports and stuff put out by our government stating that crime has gone down since the release of the first PlayStation.

74
00:06:45,001 --> 00:06:51,804
[SPEAKER_00]: Wouldn't that go to show that they're actually being given an outlet for this aggression instead of going out and actually committing the crime?

75
00:06:52,045 --> 00:06:53,805
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, does that make sense, maybe?

76
00:06:54,226 --> 00:06:56,487
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they've got their heads too far up their asses, unfortunately.

77
00:06:59,025 --> 00:07:10,830
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, we've had activists, they're demonstrating outside of New York's, or Rockstar's New York offices, and they had a list of demands, which I like to read some of their lists, which is great.

78
00:07:12,423 --> 00:07:17,426
[SPEAKER_03]: They demand that Rockstar not to release Bully under any circumstances.

79
00:07:17,526 --> 00:07:22,289
[SPEAKER_03]: Volunteer to sell its violent and sexually explicit games in adult video stores only.

80
00:07:22,669 --> 00:07:31,534
[SPEAKER_03]: Let parents return Grand Theft Auto for a full refund until they do a national awareness campaign to educate parents of the possible effects.

81
00:07:32,055 --> 00:07:37,038
[SPEAKER_03]: Create a fund for victims of unauthorized use of motor vehicle and carjackings, etc.,

82
00:07:37,765 --> 00:07:46,188
[SPEAKER_03]: Make a national apology for misleading and lying to children and parents and legislators about their intentions and causing insurance premiums to skyrocket.

83
00:07:47,985 --> 00:07:56,331
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, and it says they have to give a written response within five business days of the receipt of these demands.

84
00:07:57,331 --> 00:08:05,097
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, they're not going to get any of that crap, because there is no, again, like I said before, there is no legal precedent.

85
00:08:05,177 --> 00:08:07,558
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, they're so full of shit right at this.

86
00:08:08,179 --> 00:08:09,600
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, think about this.

87
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:17,225
[SPEAKER_00]: How is a video game responsible for insurance rates increasing, though it has nothing to do with that?

88
00:08:18,145 --> 00:08:24,429
[SPEAKER_00]: The game itself, has there been anything published that says it has a sexually explicit content for Bully?

89
00:08:24,649 --> 00:08:25,910
[SPEAKER_00]: Something about being in school?

90
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:30,292
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they're just saying that they're totally speculating.

91
00:08:30,312 --> 00:08:31,693
[SPEAKER_03]: This game isn't even done yet.

92
00:08:31,913 --> 00:08:35,515
[SPEAKER_03]: They haven't even seen anything except for one screenshot that's out there.

93
00:08:35,675 --> 00:08:40,458
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I've seen one screenshot, maybe four different screenshots, but it's all pretty much the same thing.

94
00:08:41,358 --> 00:08:44,160
[SPEAKER_03]: No one knows what this thing is about other than the main character is a bully.

95
00:08:45,697 --> 00:08:46,057
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

96
00:08:46,217 --> 00:08:49,058
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't even know what the game's about and they're already bitching about it.

97
00:08:49,439 --> 00:08:49,979
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

98
00:08:50,459 --> 00:08:51,259
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the other thing.

99
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:53,621
[SPEAKER_03]: The games are rated M for mature.

100
00:08:53,641 --> 00:08:55,761
[SPEAKER_03]: 17 and over, people.

101
00:08:55,922 --> 00:09:01,144
[SPEAKER_03]: You're telling me that an average 17-year-old in this day and age does not know what sex is.

102
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:02,961
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

103
00:09:03,321 --> 00:09:03,861
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm sure.

104
00:09:04,322 --> 00:09:06,802
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, what do you think a 17-year-old has done more?

105
00:09:07,182 --> 00:09:08,903
[SPEAKER_03]: Had sex or murdered people?

106
00:09:10,023 --> 00:09:14,764
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably said, you know, played with, you know, thumb and five fingers, but that's another story.

107
00:09:15,205 --> 00:09:16,825
[SPEAKER_00]: They at least know what it's for, right?

108
00:09:18,405 --> 00:09:19,326
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me put it this way, okay?

109
00:09:19,466 --> 00:09:21,946
[SPEAKER_03]: The average teenager out there knows what sex is.

110
00:09:22,307 --> 00:09:23,447
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's taught in schools.

111
00:09:23,687 --> 00:09:27,308
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell, we have, you know, sexual content in PG-13 movies nowadays.

112
00:09:27,368 --> 00:09:27,548
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean...

113
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:28,684
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

114
00:09:49,497 --> 00:09:50,157
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura.com

115
00:10:18,948 --> 00:10:22,330
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell do you expect these games to have content-wise anyways?

116
00:10:22,651 --> 00:10:26,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Killer7, hmm, that must be about ponies and fairies, right?

117
00:10:26,914 --> 00:10:30,596
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Grand Theft Auto, hmm, what does Grand Theft Auto mean?

118
00:10:30,616 --> 00:10:32,338
[SPEAKER_03]: It means stealing fucking cars!

119
00:10:32,658 --> 00:10:34,619
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think that's gonna be about, you know?

120
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:42,085
[SPEAKER_03]: Horses and ponies and magical, you know, pixies and, you know, the world of fun and, you know, good behavior?

121
00:10:42,305 --> 00:10:45,107
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's about violence and about...

122
00:10:45,567 --> 00:10:46,208
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

123
00:11:14,594 --> 00:11:15,074
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

124
00:11:16,315 --> 00:11:18,316
[SPEAKER_03]: We've actually got some interesting stuff.

125
00:11:19,256 --> 00:11:23,559
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing is Sony is already saying that the Xbox 360 may suck.

126
00:11:23,899 --> 00:11:29,402
[SPEAKER_03]: And just because of that, they may release their PlayStation 3 in 2007.

127
00:11:29,962 --> 00:11:37,286
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason behind it is they're worried that the 360 might have a weak launch library and basically it's going to fail.

128
00:11:38,158 --> 00:11:40,041
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, yeah, that's gonna fail, alright.

129
00:11:40,061 --> 00:11:43,926
[SPEAKER_03]: Then that first next-gen system coming out, and they're hyping the hell out of this, and it's gonna fail.

130
00:11:44,046 --> 00:11:48,873
[SPEAKER_03]: No, honestly, people are gonna buy this game, or this system, whether it has crappy games or not.

131
00:11:48,933 --> 00:11:49,734
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, look at the DS.

132
00:11:50,996 --> 00:11:53,440
[SPEAKER_03]: Though, remember what happened with the Dreamcast, sadly.

133
00:11:54,966 --> 00:12:00,547
[SPEAKER_03]: True, but I mean the Xbox 360, I mean you've got MTV backing it, I don't think so.

134
00:12:01,067 --> 00:12:06,788
[SPEAKER_03]: But the PlayStation 3 launching in 2007, I think that's a big mistake in the first place.

135
00:12:07,008 --> 00:12:19,610
[SPEAKER_03]: They're basically going to kill themselves if they end up doing that because you're going to have the revolution come out and even let's say that the Xbox 360 does flop, well then you've got the revolution, people are going to be buying that and well, where's Sony?

136
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:23,891
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they're just not there because they're waiting for their big launch library.

137
00:12:24,938 --> 00:12:25,978
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not going to happen.

138
00:12:26,319 --> 00:12:33,041
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're hoping to ride the success of the PlayStation 2 because it's going to drop down to $99, which is good.

139
00:12:33,281 --> 00:12:37,383
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they'll outsell the Xbox, but it's not going to outsell the Xbox 360.

140
00:12:38,604 --> 00:12:38,924
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

141
00:12:39,244 --> 00:12:43,486
[SPEAKER_03]: But either way, I'm going to be buying both systems when they come out, whenever that is.

142
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,761
[SPEAKER_00]: I've actually got some news in relation to the 360.

143
00:12:51,563 --> 00:13:01,728
[SPEAKER_00]: There actually is a preliminary release list from the Japan Xbox Summit 2005.

144
00:13:03,368 --> 00:13:07,210
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the ones brought up, they had like a mixtape trailer of different things.

145
00:13:09,231 --> 00:13:12,593
[SPEAKER_00]: We have Tony Hawk's American Wasteland.

146
00:13:12,753 --> 00:13:13,893
[SPEAKER_00]: We have Quake 4.

147
00:13:14,674 --> 00:13:20,096
[SPEAKER_00]: We have A-Train X. And for anyone who isn't into those train sims, again, this is the Japan one.

148
00:13:20,437 --> 00:13:22,398
[SPEAKER_00]: And the A-Train series did do very well.

149
00:13:23,038 --> 00:13:25,739
[SPEAKER_00]: Test Drive Unlimited, a Gundam game.

150
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:27,140
[SPEAKER_00]: Bondi's putting out a Gundam game.

151
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:31,922
[SPEAKER_00]: And also two titles that are, I'm supposing, anime themed.

152
00:13:33,043 --> 00:13:34,684
[SPEAKER_00]: Bon Presto putting out Super Robot Wars.

153
00:13:35,584 --> 00:14:01,458
[SPEAKER_00]: and of course Super Robot Wars has been going on since like the Super Famicom so it's been out for a while King of Fighters Maximum Impact 2 Resident Evil 5 Dead Rising from Capcom we have Eidos is putting out a title D3 Publishers Electronic Arts putting out some soccer and NBA games Need for Speed Most Wanted The Godfather

154
00:14:02,866 --> 00:14:15,155
[SPEAKER_00]: Enchant Arm, Frontier Groove, Tokyo Extreme Racer, Far East of Eden, Hudson Soft Rumble Roses XX winning 11, Ridge Racer 6, Frame City Killer There's too much coming out that I don't think it's going to flop.

155
00:14:28,652 --> 00:14:35,996
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, what their strategy this time is actually listen to what the Japanese players want instead of just releasing a system there that's basically an American system.

156
00:14:36,517 --> 00:14:37,978
[SPEAKER_03]: Another title that was coming out was Genji.

157
00:14:38,158 --> 00:14:40,319
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, actually, that's PlayStation 3, not 360.

158
00:14:40,659 --> 00:14:44,662
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, but yeah, they're definitely releasing some good library titles.

159
00:14:45,302 --> 00:14:46,383
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't wait for Ridge Racer 6.

160
00:14:47,363 --> 00:14:49,385
[SPEAKER_03]: Ridge Racer 6 is going to be fucking awesome.

161
00:14:50,545 --> 00:14:53,287
[SPEAKER_03]: And Ghost Recon, the new ones are going to be great.

162
00:14:54,625 --> 00:15:01,530
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still wanting to know what Treasure is putting out, because Treasure was the group that gave us Silhouette Mirage and Gunstar Heroes.

163
00:15:01,951 --> 00:15:02,811
[SPEAKER_00]: They're pretty awesome.

164
00:15:04,733 --> 00:15:09,416
[SPEAKER_03]: I also saw that Gun was mentioned on there, which is probably going to be one of the best Western games ever.

165
00:15:10,397 --> 00:15:15,961
[SPEAKER_03]: Just from what I've seen so far, it's coming out on the two current consoles right now, PlayStation 2 and Xbox.

166
00:15:16,702 --> 00:15:18,824
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to be amazing from what I've seen.

167
00:15:20,117 --> 00:15:24,618
[SPEAKER_03]: Dead or Alive, I mean, three Dead or Alive games is a little overkill for me, I think.

168
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:33,281
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless, unless, there's new Dead or Alive Beach Volleyball, in which case, oh, there is a brand new Dead or Alive Beach Volleyball.

169
00:15:33,761 --> 00:15:41,564
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, yes, more titillating action fan service to the extreme on Xbox 360.

170
00:15:41,804 --> 00:15:42,264
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't wait.

171
00:15:42,444 --> 00:15:46,165
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't wait for the Dead or Alive movie because this is, I hope it's all TNA.

172
00:15:46,685 --> 00:15:47,246
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I hope.

173
00:15:48,146 --> 00:15:48,566
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way,

174
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:57,117
[SPEAKER_03]: I did see some trailers, they had a new teaser for Aeon Flux, and I might have to say that that movie's gonna kick ass.

175
00:15:57,757 --> 00:16:01,080
[SPEAKER_03]: And the game's also gonna kick ass, because it looks pretty sweet so far from what I've seen.

176
00:16:02,701 --> 00:16:03,582
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, awesome!

177
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:05,704
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you have any other stories for us?

178
00:16:08,171 --> 00:16:12,733
[SPEAKER_00]: I have another one, of course, Midway's doing Feel the Rush.

179
00:16:13,434 --> 00:16:16,275
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got some celebrity talent and music lined up for it.

180
00:16:16,815 --> 00:16:23,799
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing that has me the most excited about this is it's really got an RPG element to this.

181
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:28,381
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the main rivals in the game is voiced by Bill Bellamy.

182
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:37,507
[SPEAKER_00]: We have also just quite a number of people lending their talent from West Coast Customs.

183
00:16:37,727 --> 00:16:40,348
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also the list of cars.

184
00:16:40,748 --> 00:16:43,390
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a bunch of new Dodges like the new Charger.

185
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:47,752
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the H2, which is a piece of crap, you know, fake Hummer.

186
00:16:48,613 --> 00:16:50,854
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a 1966 Pontiac GTO.

187
00:16:51,154 --> 00:16:51,695
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that cool?

188
00:16:53,135 --> 00:17:21,950
[SPEAKER_00]: the new Lotus Exige we have Mitsubishi Spider we have the Lancer Evo 5 Skyline GTR which is actually one of my favorite cars but also you're going to be able to upgrade your cars with official parts you know we have Nismo which was I'm actually sort of surprised to not see any of the rally art stuff in there since they've got Mitsubishi in there but it looks like it's going to be a fairly interactive racing game I think it's going to be pretty cool

189
00:17:24,048 --> 00:17:24,268
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

190
00:17:26,509 --> 00:17:34,590
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, obviously, there's a lot of stuff coming out in the future with the brand new systems coming out, but let's talk about some of the stuff that's going to be coming out in the next few weeks here.

191
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:41,552
[SPEAKER_03]: First off, we have next week releasing one of the godfathers of all sports games, Madden 2006, which is going to be awesome.

192
00:17:41,912 --> 00:17:46,373
[SPEAKER_03]: They have the brand new Superstar Mode, which actually links up with the NCAA 2006 as well.

193
00:17:47,113 --> 00:17:51,234
[SPEAKER_03]: If you like those sports games, personally, I couldn't care for them, but, you know, they're really good.

194
00:17:51,912 --> 00:17:52,573
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

195
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:10,029
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of fun.

196
00:18:10,549 --> 00:18:16,014
[SPEAKER_03]: And also we have coming out Darkwatch which is going to be the following week.

197
00:18:17,395 --> 00:18:27,504
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically a very interesting vampire western type game which plays very similar to Halo 2 and is freaking incredible is what it is.

198
00:18:29,646 --> 00:18:36,532
[SPEAKER_03]: Personally I'm waiting for the stuff in September like We Love Katamari and the new Ultimate Spider-Man and that type of stuff.

199
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,741
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, I take my wedding presents in video games.

200
00:18:41,361 --> 00:18:43,062
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, not necessarily housewares.

201
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:47,004
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, boy.

202
00:18:48,724 --> 00:18:54,147
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing also we should be looking forward to, the new Grand Theft Auto, which is going to be coming out, obviously, in October.

203
00:18:55,088 --> 00:18:56,448
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, lots of fun stuff.

204
00:18:58,689 --> 00:19:01,591
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, DarkSakura, do you have any advice for us this week?

205
00:19:03,837 --> 00:19:09,859
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I ever... Today's bit of advice is how to escape from a bear.

206
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:12,659
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we all need to know how to escape from a bear.

207
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,880
[SPEAKER_03]: How to escape from a giant hairy gay guy?

208
00:19:18,141 --> 00:19:19,981
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, we shipped... I'm sorry.

209
00:19:20,562 --> 00:19:21,262
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to go there.

210
00:19:21,842 --> 00:19:22,142
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

211
00:19:22,802 --> 00:19:24,943
[SPEAKER_00]: Today's bit of advice is how to escape from a bear.

212
00:19:26,352 --> 00:19:30,776
[SPEAKER_00]: 1.

213
00:19:26,792 --> 00:19:30,776
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see a bear but it does not see you, make your presence known and back away.

214
00:19:31,317 --> 00:19:33,239
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk loudly, clap, sing, or call out.

215
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:36,102
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no guaranteed minimum safe distance from a bear.

216
00:19:36,403 --> 00:19:37,223
[SPEAKER_00]: The farther the better.

217
00:19:37,704 --> 00:19:39,366
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are in a car, remain in your vehicle.

218
00:19:39,606 --> 00:19:41,608
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not get out, even for a quick photo.

219
00:19:42,009 --> 00:19:42,970
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep your windows up.

220
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:45,332
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not impede the bear from crossing the road.

221
00:19:47,374 --> 00:19:50,995
[SPEAKER_00]: 2.

222
00:19:48,094 --> 00:19:50,995
[SPEAKER_00]: If the bear looks as if it is about to attack, do not run.

223
00:19:51,075 --> 00:19:51,715
[SPEAKER_00]: Remain still.

224
00:19:52,156 --> 00:19:55,757
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, bears can run much faster than humans, and bears can climb trees.

225
00:19:56,237 --> 00:20:01,859
[SPEAKER_00]: However, documented attacks show that an attack by another black bear often ends up when the person stops fighting.

226
00:20:02,379 --> 00:20:04,099
[SPEAKER_00]: Also ends, I'm sorry, when the person stops fighting.

227
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:04,099
3.

228
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,061
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are lying still and the bear attacks, strike back with anything you can.

229
00:20:09,381 --> 00:20:11,281
[SPEAKER_00]: Go for the bear's eyes or its snout.

230
00:20:11,682 --> 00:20:15,803
[SPEAKER_00]: But my final bit of advice, don't feed the bears.

231
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:20,371
[SPEAKER_03]: and also don't cover yourself in honey.

232
00:20:21,972 --> 00:20:22,793
[SPEAKER_00]: The Bears.

233
00:20:22,813 --> 00:20:26,635
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you remember that on Saturday Night Live where they used to have Ditka?

234
00:20:26,815 --> 00:20:27,295
[SPEAKER_00]: That was cool.

235
00:20:28,796 --> 00:20:29,616
[SPEAKER_03]: The Bears.

236
00:20:30,076 --> 00:20:30,617
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

237
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:35,219
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, a little bit of the hack and cracking news we've got.

238
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,221
[SPEAKER_03]: Starting off with the PlayStation Portable.

239
00:20:38,321 --> 00:20:39,401
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, that's right, folks.

240
00:20:39,421 --> 00:20:40,562
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll be able to use it with the Xbox 360.

241
00:20:40,602 --> 00:20:41,022
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, that...

242
00:20:42,822 --> 00:20:45,064
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't a bad idea, I don't know what is.

243
00:20:45,704 --> 00:20:56,532
[SPEAKER_03]: But basically, you'll be able to actually use their media browser on the 360 to do everything from view your photos to listen to MP3s that are on the PSP.

244
00:20:56,973 --> 00:21:01,716
[SPEAKER_03]: But pretty much it can sync up with any music player or whatnot, iPod, etc.

245
00:21:02,697 --> 00:21:04,599
[SPEAKER_03]: And the PSP being, you know, just like those.

246
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,120
[SPEAKER_03]: We have the brand new...

247
00:21:08,663 --> 00:21:09,524
[SPEAKER_03]: Jack and Daxter Fired Up

248
00:21:28,486 --> 00:21:35,989
[SPEAKER_03]: And other news, because we can't just cover all the PSP crack and stuff, we've also got to cover the PlayStation 2.

249
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:46,754
[SPEAKER_03]: And for the PlayStation 2, they actually released Media Player Pro, which is a, of course, media player for the PlayStation 2, which supports CD audio.

250
00:21:47,835 --> 00:21:49,696
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, you can use it to view your...

251
00:21:51,417 --> 00:21:52,778
[SPEAKER_03]: The Key Launcher Key Launcher

252
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:22,850
[SPEAKER_03]: Doom was ported to the iPod.

253
00:22:46,684 --> 00:22:51,746
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, those people, they'll port anything on Linux, and Doom is probably the next best thing.

254
00:22:52,627 --> 00:22:54,347
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still waiting for Linux for Toaster.

255
00:22:54,507 --> 00:22:56,388
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, my bagels need to burn programs too.

256
00:22:57,789 --> 00:22:58,289
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

257
00:22:58,729 --> 00:23:04,292
[SPEAKER_03]: We need Linux for the DS, because honestly, there's nothing for the DS right now.

258
00:23:05,172 --> 00:23:06,433
[SPEAKER_03]: I need mine in 10 dogs.

259
00:23:06,473 --> 00:23:07,373
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I need too.

260
00:23:09,254 --> 00:23:11,855
[SPEAKER_00]: I get to play with my puppies, but for five minutes at a time.

261
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:13,416
[SPEAKER_00]: Ha ha ha.

262
00:23:15,242 --> 00:23:19,284
[SPEAKER_03]: Other things, more stuff for the browser, the 2.0 browser.

263
00:23:19,964 --> 00:23:31,811
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people have actually done a pretty cool WinPSPortal 2.0, which resembles a desktop, a Windows XP desktop, and actually is pretty cool from what I've tried out so far.

264
00:23:32,431 --> 00:23:35,213
[SPEAKER_03]: I personally don't have my PSP updated to 2.0 because...

265
00:23:36,413 --> 00:23:37,434
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, just not going to do that.

266
00:23:37,614 --> 00:23:57,241
[SPEAKER_03]: But the other thing was they also found out one of the little, um, things about the PSP 2.0 is that it will launch, um, custom programs if you put it in the update folder, but then immediately discovers that the program is not what it's signed to be and then stops loading it, but that might be, that might lead to, um, them breaking through the version 2.0 firmware.

267
00:23:58,381 --> 00:23:59,962
[SPEAKER_03]: Only a matter of time before they do that.

268
00:24:02,639 --> 00:24:05,680
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we can hold our breath, but we might turn blue before it happens.

269
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:10,121
[SPEAKER_00]: Then again, maybe we'll just turn like a slight shade of purple and then take our breath again.

270
00:24:11,861 --> 00:24:14,342
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I wanted to dip into the mailbox if you were done.

271
00:24:15,182 --> 00:24:15,442
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

272
00:24:16,582 --> 00:24:20,503
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually have gotten quite a number of emails, but I'm going to go ahead and read just one or two.

273
00:24:20,963 --> 00:24:25,805
[SPEAKER_00]: We got one from our buddy Steve who wrote in, wanted to...

274
00:24:27,305 --> 00:24:30,267
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually thank and congratulate us for keeping up with an awesome show.

275
00:24:30,627 --> 00:24:35,090
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you were one of the people who made our win at the podcast awards possible, so thank you.

276
00:24:36,591 --> 00:24:38,473
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I'm just going to go ahead and quote here.

277
00:24:38,493 --> 00:24:43,756
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to say the enthusiasm and overall appeal was particularly evident in this week's episode, the August 1st episode.

278
00:24:44,557 --> 00:24:49,961
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only did you break your old record for length, but you all seemed just so much more into the content, which was great to hear.

279
00:24:50,381 --> 00:24:51,422
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a reason for that.

280
00:24:52,242 --> 00:24:54,163
[SPEAKER_00]: We did the podcast on Saturday.

281
00:24:54,824 --> 00:24:55,765
[SPEAKER_00]: We did it early.

282
00:24:56,865 --> 00:25:00,328
[SPEAKER_00]: We were wide awake and not fresh from doing our three hour show.

283
00:25:00,448 --> 00:25:04,192
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we'll try to recreate that enthusiasm, don't you think?

284
00:25:05,273 --> 00:25:06,974
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we try to be very enthusiastic.

285
00:25:07,014 --> 00:25:11,018
[SPEAKER_03]: This week is hard because we're missing one of our co-hosts.

286
00:25:11,058 --> 00:25:16,783
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard to be enthusiastic on Sundays because you have to work on Mondays, but hey, whatever.

287
00:25:16,843 --> 00:25:17,243
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all good.

288
00:25:18,863 --> 00:25:24,704
[SPEAKER_00]: Another question he wanted to ask is, wanted to know what the background music during my Vice piece was.

289
00:25:25,445 --> 00:25:29,285
[SPEAKER_00]: To quote, it sounds fabulously happy, and I'd love to hear where it came from.

290
00:25:29,565 --> 00:25:31,946
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually Journey to Wonderland from Keyboard Mania.

291
00:25:32,526 --> 00:25:38,968
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we started off Bimani-themed, and that one just fits so many wrong things, and so many things it's more appropriate for.

292
00:25:40,348 --> 00:25:43,849
[SPEAKER_00]: But he wants to say once again, thanks for the excellent show, and hope you keep up the great work, guys.

293
00:25:44,989 --> 00:25:45,970
[SPEAKER_00]: We do our best.

294
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:46,610
[SPEAKER_00]: We try.

295
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:47,671
[SPEAKER_00]: We really try.

296
00:25:47,791 --> 00:25:48,732
[SPEAKER_00]: We're glad you love us.

297
00:25:50,533 --> 00:25:52,814
[SPEAKER_00]: And suddenly I'm reminded of the Quizness commercials.

298
00:25:52,874 --> 00:25:53,935
[SPEAKER_00]: We love the subs.

299
00:25:55,236 --> 00:25:57,357
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just very random today.

300
00:25:59,018 --> 00:26:04,042
[SPEAKER_00]: We also got one from a guy named Ben who said...

301
00:26:05,151 --> 00:26:09,574
[SPEAKER_00]: He actually became aware of us through DDR Freak.

302
00:26:11,135 --> 00:26:17,699
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually a moderator on DDR Freak, and all of us have frequented there in the past when we were strictly Just Bad Money related.

303
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:24,263
[SPEAKER_00]: But he wrote in to say that he thought that Loki was great drunk.

304
00:26:26,765 --> 00:26:31,768
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, yes, the classic drunk episode, which we will be recreating the drunk episode on September 11th.

305
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:34,873
[SPEAKER_03]: My birthday, which also happens to fall on a Sunday.

306
00:26:36,016 --> 00:26:37,478
[SPEAKER_03]: I will be drinking that day as well.

307
00:26:37,739 --> 00:26:44,091
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully this time not throwing up all over the place, but still as incoherent as usual.

308
00:26:46,078 --> 00:26:56,126
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what we might have to do, because it's still tentative, but I'm thinking about doing my friend-related wedding reception at Dave & Buster's on the 10th.

309
00:26:57,407 --> 00:27:02,491
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting everybody as intoxicated as possible and recording a drunken podcast from the middle of Dave & Buster's.

310
00:27:02,511 --> 00:27:03,392
[SPEAKER_00]: Wouldn't that be crazy?

311
00:27:05,213 --> 00:27:05,674
[SPEAKER_03]: Eh, maybe.

312
00:27:06,394 --> 00:27:07,175
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't want to drive.

313
00:27:09,472 --> 00:27:18,045
[SPEAKER_00]: He also wants to add in that Halo 2 isn't just another first-person shooter, and Grand Theft Auto San Andreas is a fucking great game, but it is not a revolution.

314
00:27:18,185 --> 00:27:18,826
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a great day.

315
00:27:20,548 --> 00:27:22,611
[SPEAKER_00]: I can agree with the latter statement, yeah.

316
00:27:23,012 --> 00:27:23,753
[SPEAKER_00]: I can agree with that.

317
00:27:25,395 --> 00:27:36,742
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, though, we have an interview posted with the Senior Vice President of Software for Square Enix, Hiroichi Tanaka.

318
00:27:38,103 --> 00:27:39,324
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a little bit about this.

319
00:27:39,344 --> 00:27:42,626
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to do more with Final Fantasy XI on the Xbox 360.

320
00:27:43,927 --> 00:27:48,090
[SPEAKER_00]: They said actually that it's very easy since the Xbox 360 uses DirectX.

321
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:54,094
[SPEAKER_00]: It is going to run in time with the PlayStation and PC versions of Final Fantasy XI.

322
00:27:54,994 --> 00:28:04,999
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing about it though, where it will be using the 360's Xbox Live chat function, you will not be able to chat with people on the PC since it's only on the Xbox 360 servers.

323
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:10,302
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not a built-in function of Final Fantasy XI, it's just accessing the 360 servers.

324
00:28:14,349 --> 00:28:21,535
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as the keyboard support, he says that Microsoft is thinking about adding a text input device separately.

325
00:28:22,096 --> 00:28:25,738
[SPEAKER_00]: But I remember Microsoft saying in the past that they were never going to do a keyboard.

326
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:33,545
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they're doing a really ugly controller with a stupid QWERTY keyboard that's crammed onto it as well.

327
00:28:34,565 --> 00:28:34,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Ugly.

328
00:28:35,006 --> 00:28:36,447
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen the pictures of it.

329
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:51,086
[SPEAKER_00]: but you know they had something like that before on GameCube for Phantasy Star Online but the thing is is that if they keep the controllers very similarly all they have to do is have the same keyboard adapter that Phantasy Star Online uses and then they don't have to do anything

330
00:28:51,854 --> 00:28:53,115
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't do anything anyways.

331
00:28:53,175 --> 00:28:55,657
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the Xbox 360, I'd imagine.

332
00:28:55,757 --> 00:28:56,258
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure.

333
00:28:56,598 --> 00:29:04,805
[SPEAKER_03]: I know the PlayStation 3 has USB ports and the Revolution is going to have the USB ports as well.

334
00:29:05,806 --> 00:29:09,609
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically, why not just sell a keyboard?

335
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:14,353
[SPEAKER_03]: Either have it use a USB keyboard and mouse or...

336
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:17,903
[SPEAKER_03]: I really think they should stick with what they did with Phantasy Star.

337
00:29:17,943 --> 00:29:22,647
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, another question asked is if it was going to be using the PlayOnline servers or the Microsoft servers.

338
00:29:22,707 --> 00:29:26,710
[SPEAKER_03]: It was specified they'll be using PlayOnline delays in development right now.

339
00:29:42,564 --> 00:29:46,588
[SPEAKER_00]: is that they have the window specifics up but are still working on Japanese character input.

340
00:29:46,848 --> 00:29:50,692
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a really funky screenshot on here where one of the characters, you can't see his face.

341
00:29:51,153 --> 00:29:52,394
[SPEAKER_00]: His face is totally not rendered.

342
00:29:53,635 --> 00:29:58,480
[SPEAKER_00]: About as far as if it's going to cost the same as the other versions or a different fee,

343
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:28,302
[SPEAKER_00]: they have not yet decided but also North American audiences do get to beta test Final Fantasy XI on Xbox 360 first since the 360 will be released here beta testing will be free when you get the Xbox 360 you'll be able to apply for the beta test as far as anything else though they're looking to sell for about $29 and I don't really see anything else major about that

344
00:30:31,089 --> 00:30:34,672
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, we're all on the topic of the 360 once again.

345
00:30:36,273 --> 00:30:41,838
[SPEAKER_03]: The question that's on everybody's mind, will the old games play on the new systems?

346
00:30:44,688 --> 00:30:48,990
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Xbox says, eh, maybe.

347
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:53,751
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, what's going to happen is only some games will be able to play.

348
00:30:54,132 --> 00:30:55,432
[SPEAKER_03]: Why, you may ask?

349
00:30:55,552 --> 00:31:03,095
[SPEAKER_03]: Because unlike the PlayStation 3, which actually uses, you know, they put the actual old chips on there, so it's not actual emulation.

350
00:31:03,155 --> 00:31:04,635
[SPEAKER_03]: It's playing straight out the old chips.

351
00:31:05,376 --> 00:31:10,958
[SPEAKER_03]: The Xbox, being that this brand new system is built on the NVIDIA graphics card,

352
00:31:11,918 --> 00:31:13,459
[SPEAKER_03]: The old one was built on ATI.

353
00:31:13,479 --> 00:31:16,000
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh-oh, that's a problem.

354
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:19,181
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, so they're going to have to emulate it.

355
00:31:19,601 --> 00:31:22,823
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically only some games will work with the emulation.

356
00:31:23,543 --> 00:31:26,444
[SPEAKER_03]: However, it's going to be decided case by case.

357
00:31:26,524 --> 00:31:28,405
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually it's going to be the most popular games.

358
00:31:29,245 --> 00:31:37,669
[SPEAKER_03]: It says right now they're predicting that the numbers could be somewhere between 5 and 20 of the games will be backwards compatible.

359
00:31:38,655 --> 00:32:01,151
[SPEAKER_03]: which that's kind of crappy if you ask me but supposedly I guess if you maybe if you get Xbox Live or something like that maybe they'll add more but fine let me come on now and they're not even selling Xboxes right now either they've stopped production on Xboxes for the 360 to get it ready for launch that's gonna fuck over a lot of players right now that's what I think

360
00:32:03,318 --> 00:32:08,368
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the point of even having backwards playability if it's only going to work for five games?

361
00:32:08,388 --> 00:32:10,372
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of retarded.

362
00:32:11,354 --> 00:32:12,957
[SPEAKER_03]: That's lame, but that's what they're doing.

363
00:32:14,978 --> 00:32:18,140
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds like a bunch of geniuses over Microsoft, doesn't it?

364
00:32:20,001 --> 00:32:30,366
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as other news, I'm sure that everybody who's listened to the show for a while knew that I was pretty excited about the Gizmondo coming out, putting up by Tiger Telematics.

365
00:32:30,986 --> 00:32:37,910
[SPEAKER_00]: However, they have requested or are looking for 50,000 units from the Gizmondo manufacturer.

366
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:41,512
[SPEAKER_00]: However, they're saying that there are...

367
00:32:43,073 --> 00:33:07,212
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're also saying that numerous USA retailers intend to stock the product so they're working on a press release however the system has been delayed they're actually they said that they have an unannounced highly significant game title for release but there's not really anything else saying on here looking for it looks like later on this month but it's we're supposed to be receiving more information over the next few weeks

368
00:33:09,426 --> 00:33:18,897
[SPEAKER_03]: And in other news I'd like to classify as too little too late, the Nokia N-Gage QD has announced that they're going to be releasing a silver-colored version.

369
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:23,442
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, the silver-colored version will not make it suck any less.

370
00:33:24,417 --> 00:33:24,938
[SPEAKER_03]: Back to you!

371
00:33:42,401 --> 00:33:44,223
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, I love how this is described.

372
00:33:44,263 --> 00:33:46,464
[SPEAKER_00]: Super fast action and irreverent humor.

373
00:33:47,045 --> 00:33:49,266
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it's being released in the smaller format.

374
00:33:49,307 --> 00:33:55,211
[SPEAKER_00]: The game features 13 levels and maintains a faithful conversion of the style of the game.

375
00:33:55,291 --> 00:33:59,254
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no plans for a US release that have yet been announced.

376
00:33:59,535 --> 00:34:03,978
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm sure we're going to eventually get it, because there's hardly anything we don't eventually get.

377
00:34:04,438 --> 00:34:06,660
[SPEAKER_00]: However, fair play to you.

378
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:07,461
[SPEAKER_00]: You get it first.

379
00:34:09,207 --> 00:34:11,350
[SPEAKER_03]: I want them to release Seven Sins over here.

380
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:17,757
[SPEAKER_03]: That's something that the UK has that we need to have so that they go ballistic over that one, because that's all it is, is full-on sex.

381
00:34:18,738 --> 00:34:19,659
[SPEAKER_03]: What about the Playboy game?

382
00:34:19,699 --> 00:34:21,421
[SPEAKER_03]: I never see them coming after the Playboy game.

383
00:34:23,217 --> 00:34:28,021
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that all those people trying to censor our games and everything need to get that pine tree out their ass.

384
00:34:28,041 --> 00:34:29,423
[SPEAKER_00]: Those roots are starting to stick out their mouth.

385
00:34:30,604 --> 00:34:34,487
[SPEAKER_03]: The problem is, is us gamers don't really have any way we can combat this.

386
00:34:34,687 --> 00:34:38,671
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, you know, it's all these politicians and, you know, law people.

387
00:34:38,711 --> 00:34:40,513
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just, you know, kind of coming after us.

388
00:34:40,833 --> 00:34:44,596
[SPEAKER_03]: This lawyer, first off, he needs to go up against some of these companies.

389
00:34:44,636 --> 00:34:47,479
[SPEAKER_03]: And we need some of these companies to stand up to him and just say, fuck off.

390
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:51,300
[SPEAKER_03]: because you're retarded and just fight them and make them lose in court.

391
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:58,743
[SPEAKER_02]: But then you have the whiny mothers there just, you know, oh my kid, oh my god, he could have possibly been exposed to this.

392
00:34:59,003 --> 00:35:05,365
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm suing you because he might have been exposed to this even though I don't know he was because I wasn't monitoring what he's playing and yeah.

393
00:35:06,886 --> 00:35:13,208
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing though that I like to keep in mind to put all of this into perspective, we are the gaming generation.

394
00:35:13,908 --> 00:35:16,249
[SPEAKER_00]: Our numbers are increasing daily.

395
00:35:17,404 --> 00:35:26,166
[SPEAKER_00]: Before too long, these gamers are going to grow up, and they're going to be the ones having the kids, and we're going to be the ones making the decisions, and we're going to be the ones with the power.

396
00:35:27,927 --> 00:35:34,189
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it 10, 15 years, they're going to be sitting in their wheelchairs going, We lost!

397
00:35:34,289 --> 00:35:36,929
[SPEAKER_00]: The gamers grew up and kicked our asses!

398
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:38,690
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, I'm waiting for that.

399
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:43,911
[SPEAKER_00]: We just have to keep in mind, and I love that we have this format that we can reach so many people.

400
00:35:44,391 --> 00:35:46,012
[SPEAKER_00]: Go out and spread the word, seriously.

401
00:35:46,932 --> 00:35:53,195
[SPEAKER_00]: The next parent you see bitching about this, tell them, hey, look, the FBI says crime has gone down.

402
00:35:53,535 --> 00:36:00,798
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to make sure that you do your research before you start affecting other people's livelihoods by trying to shut them down.

403
00:36:00,858 --> 00:36:06,781
[SPEAKER_00]: These are people trying to earn money and pay for their kids' educations and take care of their families just the same as you.

404
00:36:08,261 --> 00:36:11,623
[SPEAKER_00]: They're doing this because they're selfish and they don't feel like raising their own children.

405
00:36:12,824 --> 00:36:14,945
[SPEAKER_00]: We need more people to get the word out there.

406
00:36:15,005 --> 00:36:15,885
[SPEAKER_00]: Parents, do your job.

407
00:36:16,125 --> 00:36:17,706
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to start a campaign right now.

408
00:36:18,166 --> 00:36:20,227
[SPEAKER_00]: Parents, do your fucking job campaign.

409
00:36:21,007 --> 00:36:24,829
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go out there and protest in front of PTA meetings and stuff.

410
00:36:25,169 --> 00:36:25,850
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I should do that.

411
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:26,330
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be great.

412
00:36:27,574 --> 00:36:28,955
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

413
00:36:45,845 --> 00:36:54,011
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't see what the big deal is with, you know, violence or sex in an R-rated movie, which, I might add, is okay for a 17-year-old to go see.

414
00:36:54,672 --> 00:36:55,012
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay?

415
00:36:55,372 --> 00:36:56,193
[SPEAKER_03]: It's okay for that.

416
00:36:56,293 --> 00:37:05,100
[SPEAKER_03]: But you don't ever hear anymore of people going, Oh, well, I brought my kid to that, you know, movie, and there was full-on sex in it.

417
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:10,464
[SPEAKER_03]: It was rated R. I'm gonna sue you because I didn't know there was sex in this movie.

418
00:37:11,792 --> 00:37:12,573
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

419
00:37:35,709 --> 00:37:57,496
[SPEAKER_00]: you will go for the extra effort it takes to see what they're getting into before laying down the money because the moment that that money leaves your hand and pays for that game just at that moment not even when you sit your children down to play the game the moment you purchase it that is the moment that you take 100% responsibility for what your child sees you are the only one to blame

420
00:37:59,215 --> 00:38:10,161
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we should just have all parents sign off on a little form when they buy their game that's mature rated that says, I fully acknowledge the content in this game is inappropriate for anybody under the age of 17.

421
00:38:10,461 --> 00:38:21,288
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I am wholly responsible if anybody under the age of 17 is playing this in my presence and any actions or, you know, that result of them playing this.

422
00:38:22,188 --> 00:38:33,875
[SPEAKER_03]: and then when they go, I didn't know that that game was violent even though big content warnings on the front, I'm going to see you and they're like, fuck you, you signed the contract, shove it up your ass.

423
00:38:35,151 --> 00:38:39,115
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what's funny is that I deal with that daily since I work in the mortgage industry.

424
00:38:39,816 --> 00:38:43,179
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know that I had to have insurance on my house.

425
00:38:43,319 --> 00:38:43,639
[SPEAKER_00]: Bitch!

426
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:44,961
[SPEAKER_00]: You signed that form.

427
00:38:44,981 --> 00:38:46,002
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to have insurance.

428
00:38:46,442 --> 00:38:46,862
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing.

429
00:38:46,902 --> 00:38:47,963
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a great idea.

430
00:38:48,524 --> 00:38:52,688
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there should be disclaimers that people sign when they buy adult-only and M-rated games.

431
00:38:53,189 --> 00:38:54,630
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a brilliant idea.

432
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:56,872
[SPEAKER_00]: We should definitely write our congressman to lobby for that.

433
00:38:57,813 --> 00:38:58,013
[SPEAKER_00]: So...

434
00:39:00,095 --> 00:39:06,341
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other thing, too, about Killer7, and I'd like to backtrack a little bit, how they're saying that, you know, this has full-on sex stuff.

435
00:39:07,062 --> 00:39:09,544
[SPEAKER_03]: Before the game even starts, there's a little warning that comes up.

436
00:39:09,705 --> 00:39:14,810
[SPEAKER_03]: This game contains violent content and some nudity.

437
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:17,332
[SPEAKER_03]: Parental discretion advised.

438
00:39:17,592 --> 00:39:20,855
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, full-on on there, you have to hit a button to go through it, okay?

439
00:39:22,106 --> 00:39:28,449
[SPEAKER_03]: What more do these game companies need to do for you fucking people?

440
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:32,551
[SPEAKER_03]: What does it take for you to need to do your own job?

441
00:39:33,432 --> 00:39:36,813
[SPEAKER_03]: What do they need to do before you start being responsible?

442
00:39:38,214 --> 00:39:38,574
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing.

443
00:39:38,634 --> 00:39:39,735
[SPEAKER_03]: There's nothing they can do.

444
00:39:40,255 --> 00:39:46,278
[SPEAKER_03]: You want the government to come in and do your job for you so you can go kick back and get drunk and wasted and stuff and have more kids.

445
00:39:46,318 --> 00:39:48,539
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably the same way you had your kids in the first place.

446
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:49,480
[SPEAKER_03]: So,

447
00:39:50,822 --> 00:40:01,385
[SPEAKER_03]: What comes down to is, when I have my kids, I'll be watching what they're playing, and honestly, I don't mind if they play the mature games because I'll be teaching them the difference between right and wrong in the first place.

448
00:40:01,685 --> 00:40:08,386
[SPEAKER_03]: And they know that this is a game, it's fictional, it does not play in the real world, it's just like a fantasy movie.

449
00:40:09,267 --> 00:40:09,727
[SPEAKER_03]: The end.

450
00:40:09,807 --> 00:40:10,887
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what it's going to come down to.

451
00:40:12,205 --> 00:40:18,167
[SPEAKER_00]: I really think in the end it really has more to do... You know, also these parents need to give their kids a little bit more credit.

452
00:40:18,607 --> 00:40:21,068
[SPEAKER_00]: Your children are not stupid in most cases.

453
00:40:21,448 --> 00:40:23,909
[SPEAKER_00]: They only become stupid after you teach them how to be.

454
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:30,012
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, your children are most likely going to know the difference between fiction and reality.

455
00:40:30,412 --> 00:40:35,694
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they don't, then you need to take them to the psychologist or you need to go to parenting school or something.

456
00:40:36,074 --> 00:40:37,895
[SPEAKER_00]: Because then there's some seriously messed up issues.

457
00:40:38,515 --> 00:40:38,715
[SPEAKER_00]: But...

458
00:40:39,255 --> 00:40:57,809
[SPEAKER_00]: you know in the end parents need to give their children a little bit more credit and they need to take more responsibility for what their children do for what their children learn that's called parenting letting the government do it lobbying you know they're spending all this you know it's almost like that episode of South Park you remember with the when they were trying to take Terrence and Phillip off the air

459
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:23,872
[SPEAKER_00]: and their children were talking about getting into drugs and I hear smoking crack is kind of cute you know and watching porn movies while their parents backs were turned and they were so busy focusing on this one issue you know that's not parenting you need to actually take an active part in your children's lives and say hey this is what I think that they should do this is how I feel they should be raised

460
00:41:24,252 --> 00:41:24,933
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the end of it.

461
00:41:25,153 --> 00:41:29,896
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we're kind of going off on this one, but it's really, I think, a repeating theme for the show, don't you?

462
00:41:31,598 --> 00:41:40,024
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and I think on that note, we'll call this episode of Orange Laundry Ready to Go a close.

463
00:41:40,744 --> 00:41:41,985
[SPEAKER_03]: Final thoughts, DarkSakura?

464
00:41:43,346 --> 00:41:45,408
[SPEAKER_00]: I like fire and reject false icons.

465
00:41:47,182 --> 00:42:05,722
[SPEAKER_03]: my final thought is I have too many games to play and too little time and Graffiti Kingdom better come out this week or so help me God I will come after that company and I will kill them I will kill them for every I will kill them one time for every day they're late over and over and over again
