You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go edition.

Your podcast host for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.

Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Skye, and Loki.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Welcome to another edition of Orange Lounge Radio To Go.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I am Loki, and with us tonight we have the lovely DarkSakura.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Our other co-host Sky is gone. Unfortunately, we shipped him off to the East Coast via FedEx, so he won't be back until next week.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
But, first I'd like to start off by thanking everybody who voted for us for the Podcast Awards.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:54,000
For those who may not have heard yet, we won Best Gaming Podcast, and we thank you very much. We couldn't have done it without your support.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,040
Now, I like to start everything off, how Skye normally does it, with how was your gaming

11
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,040
week?

12
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,080
So Jamie, what did you play this week?

13
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:07,320
Other than widescreen pong, which actually I didn't play this week.

14
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:13,920
I played some PSO, looked at some games, I actually have Rob's birthday present here

15
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,680
that I finally got my hands on, something that he was wanting, but I'll let him talk

16
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,640
about that next week.

17
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:25,640
Mainly, I've been trying to get stuff together because I start school next week, plus I have an announcement.

18
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,640
Oh, what's the announcement?

19
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:35,640
I'm getting married on September 1st, so I've been sort of busy doing wedding stuff. Unfortunately, they don't have Wedding Planner the game. Not yet.

20
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,640
Wow, that's pretty soon.

21
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:47,640
Let's see, well this week I played quite a bit actually. I started off the week with beating Star Soldier on the PSP, which is fun.

22
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:55,640
So now I'm done with that. Then I actually played We Live Katamari, the Japanese version, so that was really nice.

23
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:01,640
Really fun game, got to play Flat Out, which is this game that came out a couple weeks ago.

24
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:06,640
It's kind of a racing game, kind of like a throwback to the old destruction derby type games.

25
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,600
really fun. Then I actually played a few more other things.

26
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:15,840
Lego Star Wars, got to try that.

27
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,560
I've played that and it's kinda crap. I don't know, I thought it was kinda fun, but

28
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,640
you know, I'm just weird like that.

29
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,280
Then also I was able to play,

30
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,800
let's see, Burnout 3. That game is so much fucking fun.

31
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,080
It's definitely worth

32
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:40,600
the best racing game of the year, the G4 of 2005. They said, you know,

33
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:45,440
great game. It's just like an arcade racing game. You can smash through everything.

34
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,460
It's really, really, really fun. I cannot stress how fun it is.

35
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:52,320
I got to play some In The Groove this week.

36
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:57,200
Yeah, well we know how that is. And it's basically

37
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,000
as bad as bad as I thought it was. So I'm

38
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
glad you know that I was renting it and not buying it.

39
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:20,000
And I actually got to try out a little bit of Genji, which is pretty cool, Japanese, I can't understand it, and NamcoX Capcom, which has one of the most kickass anime intros I've ever seen for a game, so really cool.

40
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Anyways, actually I was gonna try that one game that was suggested to me by one of our listeners.

41
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
However, again, with this week being as hectic as it was, I haven't got a chance, although

42
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,880
I've started the download on it, but another one of our listeners has pointed me in the

43
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:43,120
direction of another game that I'm going to be giving a try sometime this week as well,

44
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,600
that's along the same lines.

45
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,120
It's supposed to be pretty cool.

46
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,280
Awesome.

47
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:55,240
Well, let's go ahead and start this week off here with a little bit of gaming news.

48
00:03:55,240 --> 00:04:10,240
First off, the wonderful Jack Thompson is coming after yet another game, because you know, parents can't decide for their kids what they need to play. We need a stupid lawyer from Florida, which all good things come from Florida.

49
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:19,240
Anyways, we've got Jack Thompson coming after Killer7 now, and basically his quote is,

50
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:27,240
"'There is no question in my mind that a video game containing full-blown sex sequences cannot be rated anything other than adults only, rather than M.

51
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:32,240
The full-blown sex sequences are no more than you could see in an R-rated movie.'"

52
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:46,240
But for those who aren't keeping tally, Jack Thompson was the guy that actually brought this whole hot coffee thing to the table and blew it way out of proportion, like everything, and just is coming after yet more games.

53
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,240
In other words, he's the lead asshole in charge of the brigade.

54
00:04:49,240 --> 00:05:10,240
Yes, he sucks. And basically, he actually did an interview on Chatterbox video game radio, basically bitching about different things, and including how he says Will Wright wants Electronic Arts to collaborate with the porn industry to allow wholesale modification of their game, Sims 2, because of this whole third-party porn thing.

55
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:15,240
Which, by the way, has nothing to do with EA's game in the first place.

56
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,240
This is completely like some perverted people out there making mods.

57
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:26,240
Because Sims 2 allows you to actually make third party mods, including brand new clothing, skins, and furniture and whatnot.

58
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,240
And of course you know there's going to be somebody out there that's going to make a nude skin.

59
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,240
So, he's blaming them saying,

60
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,240
Oh, well you know, because you're allowing modification in the game, you're to blame for this crap.

61
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,240
It's retarded. Honestly, extremely retarded, this guy is.

62
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,240
I wish we could get him on our show so I could punch him in the face, but, you know, that's just me.

63
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:51,240
But, the other thing, since we've got a ton of people hating on Rockstar right now,

64
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:57,240
there were people coming after the game that hasn't even, mind you, hasn't even been finished yet.

65
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,240
And they're coming after the game already.

66
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:04,240
And that game would be the brand new Bully by Rockstar.

67
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:09,360
And we actually have anti-bullying groups coming out to Rockstar about this game saying

68
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,560
they shouldn't be released and they have a list of demands.

69
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,480
A list of demands that they basically wanted them to donate money to this anti-bullying

70
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,480
fund.

71
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:22,180
They're saying that games like Grand Theft Auto and stuff actually raise insurance rates.

72
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:26,300
Just throwing out all these bogus weird claims that mean nothing.

73
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,800
They're just groundless.

74
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:35,060
They obviously haven't read, you know, like I brought up last week about the FBI's reports

75
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:41,740
and, uh, you know, stuff put out by our government stating that crime has gone down since the

76
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:44,780
release of the, uh, first PlayStation.

77
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:48,360
You know, wouldn't that go to show that they're actually being given, maybe, an outlet for

78
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,780
this aggression instead of going out and actually committing the crime?

79
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,940
I mean, does that make sense, maybe?

80
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:58,940
No, they've got their heads too far up their asses, unfortunately.

81
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:07,940
Basically, we've had activists demonstrating outside of Rockstar's New York offices, and they had a list of demands.

82
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:11,940
I like to read some of their lists, which is great.

83
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:21,940
They demand that Rockstar not to release Bully under any circumstances, volunteer to sell its violent and sexually explicit games in adult video stores only,

84
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:31,940
Let parents return Grand Theft Auto for a full refund until they do a national awareness campaign to educate parents of the content and possible effects.

85
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:36,940
Create a fund for victims of unauthorized use of motor vehicle and carjackings, etc.

86
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:46,940
Make a national apology for misleading and lying to children, parents, and legislators about their intentions and causing insurance premiums to skyrocket.

87
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:53,820
Right, and it basically says they have to give a written response within five business

88
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:57,540
days of the receipt of these demands.

89
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:01,940
First of all, they're not going to get any of that crap because there is no, again, like

90
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:05,100
I said before, there is no legal precedent.

91
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:08,100
I'm sorry, they're so full of shit right at this.

92
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,740
I mean, think about this.

93
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:16,620
How is a video game responsible for insurance rates increasing, though it has nothing to

94
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:21,220
do with that the game itself has there been anything published that says it has

95
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:27,540
a sexually explicit content for bully something about being in school no

96
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:31,340
they're just saying that they're totally speculating this game isn't even done

97
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:34,580
yet they haven't even seen anything except for one screenshot that's out

98
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:38,620
there me actually I've seen one screenshot maybe four different

99
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:42,260
screenshots but it's all pretty much the same thing no one knows what this thing

100
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:46,860
about other than the main characters a bully that's it they don't even know

101
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,700
what the games about and they're already bitching about it you know what this is

102
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:56,020
the other thing the games are rated M for mature 17 and over people you're

103
00:08:56,020 --> 00:09:00,360
telling me that an average 17 year old in this day and age does not know what

104
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:06,400
sex is oh yeah yeah I'm sure okay what do you think a 17 year old has done

105
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:12,200
more had sex or murdered people I probably said you know played with you

106
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:16,180
know thumb and five fingers but that's another story at least know what it's

107
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:21,320
for right let me play this way okay the average teenager out there knows what

108
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:25,480
sex is I mean it's taught in schools hell we have you know sexual content and

109
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:29,980
pg-13 movies nowadays I mean this is nothing new and the fact that they're

110
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:33,420
coming after a game that was already super violent in the first place you

111
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:37,280
know great you know racist language and all that type of stuff and now they're

112
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:43,560
Oh my god, it showed some titties. That's it. Time to pull it off the shelves. You know, that's ridiculous

113
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:48,040
What they need to do is just tell these guys to go fuck off is what they need to do.

114
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,020
I really hope that some of these parent groups are listening to our podcast

115
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:57,560
I really do because you want to know who's to blame for all the violent crime and who's out for

116
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,200
You know what the real cause of it. It's not Rockstar Games. It's you

117
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,880
This is your fault because you refuse to raise your children

118
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:11,020
You refuse to research what you buy for your children you want TV and video games to do your jobs for you

119
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:17,900
And I'm sorry, that's not gonna cut it anymore. You are the one who is to blame take some responsibility for yourself

120
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:25,440
What the hell do you expect these games to have content wise anyways killer seven hmm that must be about ponies and fairies

121
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:32,020
Right you know grand theft auto hmm. What does grand theft auto mean mean stealing fucking cars?

122
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:36,260
what do you think that's going to be about you know horses and ponies and

123
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:42,000
magical you know pixies and you know the world of fun and you know good behavior

124
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,840
no it's about violence and about you know murdering people about cop killing

125
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:53,840
about fucking prostitutes this is what the game is about and honestly folks it

126
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:57,120
doesn't matter if there's a little bit sexual content because that's just like

127
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,460
icing on the cake you're eating the cake anyways and then you're gonna bitch

128
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:06,820
about the IC being too rich that's what it comes down to just pathetic I'd say

129
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:12,580
it's pure pathetic all right well enough of that but we're gonna talk to

130
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:20,560
about now let's see we've actually got some interesting stuff one thing is Sony

131
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:25,900
is already saying that the Xbox 360 may suck and there just because of that they

132
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:32,900
may release their PS3 in 2007. The reason behind it is they're worried that the 360

133
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:39,160
might have a weak launch library and basically it's going to fail. Right, yeah, it's going

134
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:42,940
to fail alright. The first next-gen system coming out and they're hyping the hell out

135
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:47,220
of this and it's going to fail. No, honestly, people are going to buy this game, or this

136
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:50,460
system, whether it has crappy games or not. I mean, look at the DS.

137
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:54,380
Though, remember what happened with the Dreamcast, sadly.

138
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:59,300
true but I mean the Xbox 360 I mean you've got MTV backing it

139
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:03,180
I don't think so but the PlayStation 3

140
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:06,980
launching in 2007 I think that's a big mistake in the first place

141
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:10,580
they're basically gonna kill themselves if they end up doing that because

142
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:14,660
you're gonna have the revolution come out and even let's say that the Xbox 360

143
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:15,340
does flop

144
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:19,660
well then you've got the revolution people are going to be buying that and well where's Sony

145
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:23,300
up well they're just not there because they're waiting for their big launch

146
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:23,980
library

147
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:28,520
it's not going to happen but they're hoping to ride the success of the

148
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:31,640
PlayStation 2 because it's going to drop down to $99

149
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:36,280
which is good. I think they'll outsell the Xbox but it's not going to outsell the

150
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,480
Xbox 360

151
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,840
I don't know but either way

152
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:45,360
I'm going to be buying both systems when they come out whenever that is.

153
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,260
I've actually got some news in relation to the 360

154
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:52,720
there actually is

155
00:12:52,720 --> 00:13:03,440
This is a preliminary release list from the Japan Xbox Summit 2005.

156
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:09,240
Some of the ones brought up, they had like a mixed tape trailer of different things.

157
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:17,520
We have Tony Hawk's American Wasteland, we have Quake 4, we have A-Train X, and for anyone

158
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:21,480
who is into those train sims, again this is the Japan one, and the A-Train series did

159
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:27,920
do very well. Test Drive Unlimited, a Gundam game, Bondi's putting out a Gundam game, and

160
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:34,360
also two titles that are, I'm supposing, anime themed. Bonpresto putting out Super Robot

161
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:39,320
Wars, and of course Super Robot Wars has been going on since like the Super Famicon, so

162
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:45,520
it's been out for a while. King of Fighters Maximum Impact 2, Resident Evil 5, Dead Rising

163
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:55,960
from Capcom. We have Eidos is putting out a title, D3 Publishers, Electronic Arts putting

164
00:13:55,960 --> 00:14:03,340
out some soccer and NBA games, Need for Speed Most Wanted, The Godfather. We also have Enchant

165
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:10,480
Arm from Software, Frontier Groove Incorporated, we have Tokyo Extreme Racer, we have Far East

166
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:16,360
of Eden from Hudson Soft. So, um, I don't know what the hell they're talking about.

167
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:22,440
You know, RumbleRosesXX winning 11, there's just so much. We have Ridge Racer 6 coming

168
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:27,880
out, Frame City Killer. There's too much coming out that I don't think is gonna flop.

169
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:33,000
Well, what their strategy this time is actually listen to what the Japanese players want instead

170
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,080
of just releasing a system there that's basically an American system. Another title that was

171
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:40,560
coming out was Genji well actually actually that's PlayStation 3 not 360

172
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,800
anyways but um yeah they're definitely releasing some good library titles I

173
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:50,040
can't wait for Ridge Racer 6 Ridge Racer 6 is gonna be fucking awesome and

174
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:55,840
Ghost Recon the new ones are gonna be great I'm still wanting to know what the

175
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:59,160
one Treasure's putting out because Treasure was the group that gave us

176
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:05,120
Silhouette Mirage and Gunstar Heroes you know they're pretty awesome I also saw

177
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,840
shotgun was mentioned on there, which is probably going to be one of the best western games

178
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:13,800
ever. I mean, just from what I've seen so far, it's coming out on the two current consoles

179
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:20,220
right now, PlayStation 2 and Xbox. That's going to be amazing from what I've seen. Dead

180
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:26,040
or Live, I mean, three Dead or Live games is a little overkill for me, I think. Unless,

181
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:32,280
unless there's new Dead or Live beach volleyball, in which case, oh, there is a brand new Dead

182
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:46,280
Yes, yes, more titillating action, fanservice, to the extreme on Xbox 360. I can't wait. I can't wait for the Dead or Alive movie because I hope it's all T&A.

183
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:57,280
That's what I hope. By the way, I did see some trailers. They had a new teaser for Aeon Flux, and I might have to say that that movie's gonna kick ass.

184
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:01,280
And the game's also going to kick ass because it looks pretty sweet so far from what I've seen.

185
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:06,280
Alright, awesome! Did you have any other stories for us?

186
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:12,280
I have another one. Of course, Midway's doing Feel the Rush.

187
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:16,280
They've got some celebrity talent and music lined up for it.

188
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:23,280
The thing that has me the most excited about this is it's really got an RPG element to this.

189
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:30,160
One of the main rivals in the game is voiced by Bill Bellamy.

190
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:37,840
We have also just quite a number of people lending their talent from West Coast Customs.

191
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,760
There's also the list of cars.

192
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,920
We have a bunch of new Dodges like the new Charger.

193
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,620
We have the H2, which is a piece of crap, you know, fake Hummer.

194
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:52,960
We have the 1966 Pontiac GTO, isn't that cool?

195
00:16:52,960 --> 00:17:01,820
the new Lotus Exige, we have Mitsubishi Spider, we have the Lancer Evo 5, Skyline GTR, which

196
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:07,140
is actually one of my favorite cars, but also you're going to be able to upgrade your cars

197
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:13,100
with official parts, you know, we have Nismo, which was, you know, put out a racing part.

198
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,920
I'm actually sort of surprised to not see any of the Rally Arts stuff in there since

199
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:20,400
they've got Mitsubishi in there, but it looks like it's going to be a fairly interactive

200
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,200
racing game, I think it's going to be pretty cool.

201
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,200
Nice.

202
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:30,120
Now, obviously, there's a lot of stuff coming out in the future with the brand new systems

203
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:34,120
coming out, but let's talk about some of the stuff that's going to be coming out next few

204
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,120
weeks here.

205
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,780
First off, we have next week releasing one of the godfathers of all sports games, Madden

206
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,520
2006, which is going to be awesome.

207
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:47,120
They have the brand new superstar mode, which actually links up with the NCAA 2006 as well.

208
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,860
If you like those sports games, personally I couldn't care for them, but you know, they're

209
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:51,860
really good.

210
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:55,080
We've also got one of my favorites that I've been waiting for because I keep pushing this

211
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:58,960
thing back and further and further and further, Graffiti Kingdom, which is going to kick ass

212
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,540
the sequel to Magic Pen Jell, which came out I believe last year, where you get to draw

213
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:06,660
your own characters, and basically for people like me we get to draw a lot of perverted

214
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:10,660
shit and make it fight stuff, and that's a lot of fun.

215
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:17,820
And also we have coming out Darkwatch which is going to be the following week.

216
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:24,020
Basically a very interesting vampire western type game which plays very similar to Halo

217
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:28,020
2 and is freaking incredible is what it is.

218
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:34,700
Personally I'm waiting for the stuff in September like We Love Katamari and the new Ultimate

219
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:38,020
Spiderman and that type of stuff.

220
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:44,020
However, I take my wedding presents and video games, you know, not necessarily housewares.

221
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:54,020
Oh boy, um, the other thing also we should be looking forward to, the new Grand Theft Auto which is going to be coming out obviously in October.

222
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:57,020
So yeah, lots of fun stuff.

223
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:02,020
Um, now Dark Sakura, do you have any advice for us this week?

224
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:06,020
Do I ever.

225
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:10,020
Today's bit of advice is how to escape from a bear.

226
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:14,020
Because we all need to know how to escape from a bear.

227
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:18,020
How to escape from a giant, hairy, gay guy?

228
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:22,020
Remember, we shipped ro- I'm sorry. I'm not going to go there.

229
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:26,020
Okay. Today's bit of advice is how to escape from a bear.

230
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:30,020
Number one. If you see a bear but it does not see you, make your presence known and back away.

231
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:35,580
back away. Talk loudly, clap, sing, or call out. There is no guaranteed minimum safe distance

232
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:39,900
from a bear. The farther the better. If you are in a car, remain in your vehicle. Do not

233
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:44,820
get out, even for a quick photo. Keep your windows up. Do not impede the bear from crossing

234
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:51,820
the road. 2. If the bear looks as if it is about to attack, do not run. Remain still.

235
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:57,260
Remember, bears can run much faster than humans, and bears can climb trees. However, documented

236
00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:02,260
The attacks show that an attack by a mother black bear often ends up when the person stops fighting.

237
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:04,260
Also ends, I'm sorry, when the person stops fighting.

238
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:09,260
Three, if you are lying still and the bear attacks, strike back with anything you can.

239
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:11,260
Go for the bear's eyes or its snout.

240
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:17,260
But my final bit of advice, don't feed the bears.

241
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:21,260
And also don't cover yourself in honey.

242
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:23,260
The bears.

243
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:28,260
Do you remember that on Saturday Night Live where they used to have Ditka? That was cool.

244
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:35,260
The Bears! Okay. Well, a little bit of the hack-and-crackin' news we've got.

245
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:41,260
Starting off with the PlayStation Portable. Yes, that's right folks. You'll be able to use it with the Xbox 360.

246
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:45,260
Man, that isn't a bad idea. I don't know what is.

247
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:52,220
But basically you'll be able to actually use their media browser on the 360 to do everything

248
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:57,060
from view your photos to listen to MP3s that are on the PSP.

249
00:20:57,060 --> 00:21:02,220
But pretty much it can sync up with any music player or whatnot, iPod, etc.

250
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:06,100
And the PSP being just like those.

251
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,740
We have the brand new...

252
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,780
They're actually working on some more games coming out.

253
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:18,420
We have a Jak & Daxter that's going to be released pretty soon, and Fired Up, which

254
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:23,220
is a pretty cool, kind of a Twisted Metal type game.

255
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:28,540
Honestly we need some more Vigilante 8, that's what I'm waiting for.

256
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:34,380
In other news, because we can't just cover all the PSP cracking stuff, we've also got

257
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:37,660
to cover the Playstation 2.

258
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:42,960
For the PlayStation 2, they actually released Media Player Pro, which is a media player

259
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:51,720
for the PlayStation 2, which supports CD audio, actually you can use it to view your movies

260
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,660
and whatnot.

261
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:56,580
So that's kind of interesting.

262
00:21:56,580 --> 00:22:01,900
And one of the things I was actually playing with this week was the Key Launcher, which

263
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:06,920
Which is a memory card program to launch homebrew stuff without a mod chip.

264
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,180
Which is really awesome.

265
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:11,280
So I highly recommend that you download it if you're trying to play some of those wonderful

266
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:15,360
games that you should be playing on your Playstation 2.

267
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,400
Look up for the key launcher.

268
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,400
It's awesome.

269
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:24,720
And finally, of all the weird ports in the world, this one involving Mac stuff, or Apple

270
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,160
stuff, Doom was ported to the iPod.

271
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,440
Why the hell would you port Doom to the iPod?

272
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,440
But you did.

273
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:37,120
Anyways, and it's a bit sluggish right now, but it runs off of the iPod Linux, and this

274
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,120
is also the same thing.

275
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:45,480
It's not quite the Doom for the Nokia 770, which was also done earlier this week, but

276
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:51,680
you know, those people, they'll port anything on Linux, and Doom is probably the next best

277
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,680
thing.

278
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,560
I'm still waiting for Linux for Toaster.

279
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:57,840
You know, my bagels need to burn programs too.

280
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:04,040
You know what, we need Linux for the DS because honestly there's nothing for the DS right

281
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,040
now.

282
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:09,160
I need my Nintendogs, that's what I need too.

283
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:15,320
I get to play with my puppies but for five minutes at a time.

284
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:20,040
Other things, more stuff for the browser, the 2.0 browser.

285
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:27,880
Some people have actually done the pretty cool WinPS Portal 2.0, which resembles a desktop,

286
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:32,280
a Windows XP desktop, and actually is pretty cool from what I've tried out so far.

287
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:37,680
I personally don't have my PSP updated to 2.0 because I'm just not going to do that.

288
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:42,720
But the other thing was they also found out one of the little things about the PSP 2.0

289
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:47,140
is that it will launch custom programs if you put it in the update folder, but then

290
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:51,540
immediately discovers that the program is not what it's signed to be, and then stops

291
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:58,780
loading it, but that might lead to them breaking through the version 2.0 firmware. Only a matter

292
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:05,020
of time before they do that. Well, we can hold our breath, but we might turn blue before

293
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:09,580
it happens. Then again, maybe we'll just turn like a slight shade of purple and then take

294
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:16,600
our breath again. We actually wanted to dip into the mailbox if you were done. Okay. We

295
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,520
We actually have gotten quite a number of emails, but I'm going to go ahead and read

296
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,000
just one or two.

297
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:28,560
We got one from our buddy Steve, who wrote in, wanted to actually thank and congratulate

298
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,680
us for keeping up with an awesome show.

299
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:34,520
You know, you were one of the people who made our win at the podcast awards possible, so

300
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,520
thank you.

301
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:40,080
You also, I'm just going to go ahead and quote here, I have to say the enthusiasm and overall

302
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:44,640
appeal was particularly evident in this week's episode, the August 1st episode.

303
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,520
Not only did you break your old record for length, but you all seemed just so much more

304
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,520
into the content, which was great to hear.

305
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,260
There's a reason for that.

306
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,840
We did the podcast on Saturday.

307
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,760
We did it early.

308
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:00,560
And we were wide awake and not fresh from doing our three hour show.

309
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:04,960
However, you know, we'll try to recreate that enthusiasm, don't you think?

310
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,100
Yeah, we try to be very enthusiastic.

311
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:11,280
This week is hard because we're missing one of our co-hosts and, uh, you know, it's hard

312
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:15,780
to be enthusiastic on Sundays because you have to work on Mondays but hey

313
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:21,620
whatever you know it's all good another question you wanted to ask is wanted to

314
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:26,160
know what the background music during my advice piece was to quote it sounds

315
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:30,140
fabulously happy and you'd love to hear where it came from it's actually journey

316
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:34,060
to Wonderland from keyboard mania because we started off the money themed

317
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:38,280
and that one just fits so many wrong things and so many things that's more

318
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,280
appropriate for.

319
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:43,060
Um, but he wants to say once again, thanks for the excellent show and hope you keep up

320
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:44,060
the great work guys.

321
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:46,240
And we do our best.

322
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,240
We try.

323
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,240
We really try.

324
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,600
We're glad you love us.

325
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,920
And suddenly I'm reminded of the Quiznos commercials.

326
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,200
We love the subs.

327
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,040
I'm just very random today.

328
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:08,160
Um, we also got one from a guy named Ben who said, uh, he, uh, actually, uh, became aware

329
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:13,240
of us through, uh, DDR Freak, who, uh, I'm actually, uh, a moderator on DDR Freak and

330
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:18,120
all of us have frequented their, in the past when we were strictly Jesse Bamani related.

331
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:25,200
Um, but, uh, he was, you know, wrote in to say that he thought that Loki was great drunk.

332
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:31,200
Ah, yes, the classic drunk episode, which we will be re-creating the drunk episode on

333
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:35,920
September 11th, my birthday, which also happens to fall on Sunday.

334
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,760
I will be drinking that day as well.

335
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:46,120
Hopefully this time not throwing up all over the place, but still as incoherent as usual.

336
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:49,600
You know what we might have to do, because it's still tentative, but I'm thinking about

337
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:58,080
doing my friend related wedding reception at Dave and Busters on the 10th, getting everybody

338
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:02,040
as intoxicated as possible and recording a drunken podcast from the middle of Dave and

339
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,040
Busters.

340
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,040
Wouldn't that be crazy?

341
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,040
Eh, maybe.

342
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:09,440
I just don't want to drive.

343
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:14,280
He also wants to add in that Halo 2 isn't just another first person shooter, and Grand

344
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:18,280
Theft Auto San Andreas is a fucking great game, but it is not a revolution.

345
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:25,280
a great day. I can agree with the latter statement, yeah. I can agree with that. Also though,

346
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:33,120
we have an interview posted with the Senior Vice President of Software for Square Enix,

347
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:41,280
Hiroichi Tanaka. Just a little bit about this, it has to do more with Final Fantasy 11 on

348
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:48,880
the Xbox 360, they said actually that it's very easy since the Xbox 360 uses Direct X.

349
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:55,040
It is going to run in time with the Playstation and PC versions of Final Fantasy 11.

350
00:27:55,040 --> 00:28:00,720
One thing about it though, where it will be using the 360's Xbox Live chat function, you

351
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:05,920
will not be able to chat with people on the PC since it's only on the Xbox 360 servers.

352
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:14,360
And it's not a built-in function of Final Fantasy XI, it's just accessing the 360 servers.

353
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:20,060
As far as the keyboard support, he says that Microsoft is thinking about adding a text

354
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:24,920
input device separately, but I remember Microsoft saying in the past that they were never going

355
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,120
to do a keyboard.

356
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:32,320
No they're doing a really ugly controller with a stupid QWERTY keyboard that's crammed

357
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,080
onto it as well.

358
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,080
Ugly.

359
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,080
I've seen the pictures of it.

360
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:42,080
But you know, they had something like that before on GameCube for Phantasy Star Online.

361
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:50,080
But the thing is that if they keep the controllers very similarly, all they have to do is have the same keyboard adapter that Phantasy Star Online uses.

362
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,080
And then they don't have to do anything.

363
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:56,080
They don't have to do anything anyways. I mean, the Xbox 360, I'd imagine.

364
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:01,280
I'm not sure, I know PlayStation 3 has USB ports and the Xbox, or the Revolution is going

365
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:05,940
to have the USB ports as well.

366
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:13,780
And basically, why not just sell a keyboard, either have it use a USB keyboard and mouse

367
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:19,300
or have it just use a wireless keyboard and mouse or something.

368
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:22,080
I don't understand why you wouldn't support that.

369
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:27,560
they want you to buy this really subpar controller that you're only going to use for one game.

370
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,560
It's kind of crappy.

371
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:33,540
I really think they should stick with what they do with Phantasy Star.

372
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:36,880
Also another question asked is if it was going to be using the Play Online servers or the

373
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,400
Microsoft servers.

374
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,720
It was specified they'll be using Play Online.

375
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:45,060
Delays in development right now is that they have the Windows specifics up but are still

376
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:46,960
working on Japanese character input.

377
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,240
There's a really funky screenshot on here where one of the characters, you can't see

378
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,240
his face.

379
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,880
space is totally not rendered.

380
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:59,040
About as far as if it's going to cost the same as the other versions or different fee,

381
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:06,960
they have not yet decided, but also North American audiences do get to beta test Final

382
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:12,720
Fantasy XI on Xbox 360 first, since the 360 will be released here.

383
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,640
Beta testing will be free when you get the Xbox 360, you will be able to apply for the

384
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:20,560
beta test.

385
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:26,580
As far as anything else though, they're looking to sell for about $29, and I don't really

386
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:29,480
see anything else major about that.

387
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:35,440
All right, I'm all on the topic of the 360 once again.

388
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:44,840
The question that's on everybody's mind, will the old games play on the new systems?

389
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:50,280
Well Xbox says, eh, maybe.

390
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:55,880
what's going to happen is only some games will be able to play. Why, you may ask? Because

391
00:30:55,880 --> 00:31:00,600
unlike the Playstation 3, which actually uses, you know, they put the actual old chips on

392
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:06,560
there so it's not actual emulation, it's playing straight off the old chips. The Xbox, being

393
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:12,720
that this brand new system is built on the Nvidia graphics card, the old one was built

394
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:19,720
on ATI. Uh oh! That's a problem! Well, so they're gonna have to emulate it. And basically

395
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:26,520
only some games will work with the emulation. However, it's gonna be decided case by case.

396
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:33,040
Usually it's gonna be the most popular games. It says right now, they're predicting that

397
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:38,760
the numbers could be somewhere between 5 and 20 of the games will be backwards compatible.

398
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:46,680
Which that's kind of crappy if you ask me, but supposedly I guess if you get Xbox Live

399
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,880
or something like that, maybe they'll add more.

400
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,960
But fine, I mean come on now, and they're not even selling Xboxes right now, either

401
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:58,120
they've stopped production on Xboxes for the 360 to get it ready for launch.

402
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:02,380
That's going to fuck over a lot of players right now, that's what I think.

403
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:07,140
And I mean the whole point, what's the point of even having backwards playability if it's

404
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,480
only going to work for five games?

405
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:15,200
kind of retarded. So, that's lame, but that's what they're doing.

406
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,800
Sounds like a bunch of geniuses over Microsoft, doesn't it?

407
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:24,360
Um, as far as other news, we, uh, you know, I'm sure that everybody who's listened to

408
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:28,360
the show for a while knew that I was pretty excited about the Gizmondo coming out, putting

409
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:35,760
up by, uh, Tiger Telematics. However, um, they have requested or are looking for 50,000

410
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:43,240
units from the Gizmondo manufacturer, um, however, they're saying that there are, uh,

411
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:47,200
they are also saying that numerous, uh, USA retailers intend to stock the product, so

412
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:54,000
they're working on a press release, however, the system has been delayed, um, they're actually,

413
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,620
they said that they have an unannounced highly significant game title for release, but there's

414
00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:03,700
not really anything else saying, um, on here, looking for, it looks like later on, uh, this

415
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:07,700
But we're supposed to be receiving more information over the next few weeks.

416
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:12,700
And another news I'd like to classify as too little too late.

417
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:19,700
The Nokia N-Gage QD has announced that they're going to be releasing a silver colored version.

418
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:23,700
Unfortunately the silver colored version will not make it suck any less.

419
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,700
Back to you.

420
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:28,700
Suckage in a pretty package?

421
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:33,780
Um, also for our UK listeners, guess what? You get something before we do!

422
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:37,460
You get Alien Hominid on the Game Boy Advance.

423
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:42,340
Um, the game is already out on the PS2 and Xbox.

424
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:46,940
Basically, I love how this is described. Super fast action and irreverent humor.

425
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:51,100
However, it's being released in the smaller format. The game features 13 levels and maintains a

426
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,980
faithful conversion

427
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:58,860
of the style of the game. There are no plans for a US release that have yet been announced.

428
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:03,080
So, I'm not sure we're going to eventually get it, because there's hardly anything we

429
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:09,080
don't eventually get. However, fair play to you, you get it first.

430
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:13,320
I want them to release Seven Sins over here. That's something that the UK has that we need

431
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:17,160
to have so that they go ballistic over that one, because that's all it is, is full-on

432
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:18,160
sex.

433
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:22,160
What about the Playboy game? I never see them coming after the Playboy game.

434
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:28,160
I think that all those people trying to censor our games and everything need to get that pine tree out their ass.

435
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:30,160
Those roots are starting to stick out their mouth.

436
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:34,160
The problem is, is us gamers don't really have any way we can combat this.

437
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:40,160
It's just, you know, it's all these politicians and, you know, law people that are just, you know, kinda coming after us.

438
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:46,160
This lawyer, first off, he needs to go up against some of these companies, and we need some of these companies to stand up to him and just say,

439
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:49,820
them and just say fuck off because you're retarded and just fight them and

440
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:53,660
make them lose in court but then you have the whiny mothers they're just you

441
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:59,580
know oh my kid oh my god he could have possibly been exposed to this I'm suing

442
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:02,900
you because he might have been exposed to this even though I don't know he was

443
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:07,500
because I wasn't monitoring what he's playing and yeah one thing though that I

444
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:12,180
like to keep in mind to put all of this into perspective we are that we are the

445
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:18,740
gaming generation our numbers are increasing daily before too long these

446
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:22,380
gamers are going to grow up and they're going to be the ones having the kids and

447
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:25,420
we're going to be the ones making the decisions and we're going to be the ones

448
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:31,460
with the power you know give it 10 15 years they're gonna be sitting in their

449
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:37,900
wheelchairs going we lost the gamers grew up and kicked our asses oh yeah I'm

450
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:41,900
waiting for that you know we just have to keep in mind and I love that we have

451
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:46,940
this format that we can reach so many people, go out and spread the word seriously.

452
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:52,380
The next parent you see bitching about this, tell them, hey, look, the FBI says crime has

453
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:53,380
gone down.

454
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:57,620
You need to make sure that you do your research before you start, you know, affecting other

455
00:35:57,620 --> 00:36:00,940
people's livelihoods by trying to shut them down.

456
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:05,300
These are people trying to earn money and pay for their kids' educations and take care

457
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:07,460
of their families, just the same as you.

458
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:10,980
You know, they're doing this because they're selfish and they don't feel like raising their

459
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:15,340
own children you know we need more people to get the word out there parents

460
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:19,580
do your job I'm gonna start a campaign right now parents do your fucking job

461
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:24,340
campaign I'm gonna go out there and protest in front of like PTA meetings

462
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:29,160
and stuff I think I should do that that'd be great what we need to do is we

463
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:33,300
need to get a group of people and basically the back up the idea okay so

464
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:37,580
they want to be you know they want you know awareness of what the games have

465
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:40,760
content-wise well that's already on there I mean that's just like movies

466
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:44,360
okay you know they display on movies what's in the movie and that type of

467
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:48,980
thing I don't see what the big deal is with you know violence or sex in an

468
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:55,400
r-rated movie which I might add is okay for a 17 year old to go see okay it's

469
00:36:55,400 --> 00:37:00,380
okay for that but you don't ever hear any more of people going oh well I

470
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:05,700
brought my kid to that new movie and there was full-on sex in it it was rated

471
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:11,980
are. I'm going to sue you because I didn't know there was sex in this movie.

472
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:18,340
That's what things called reviews are. They do pre-screenings of movies so that the critics

473
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:23,260
can look at it and rip it apart before you get a chance to. If you want to know the content

474
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:29,540
of any movie, go online and look at the goddamn reviews. The same thing goes for video games.

475
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:35,780
are reviews posted if you are so worried if you love your children enough you

476
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:39,940
will go to put forth the extra effort it takes to see what they're getting into

477
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:43,940
before laying down the money because the moment that that money leaves your hand

478
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:48,120
and pays for that game and you sit just at that moment not even when you sit

479
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:52,080
your children down to play the game the moment you purchase it that is the

480
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:56,780
moment that you take 100% responsibility for what your child sees you are the

481
00:37:56,780 --> 00:38:03,780
I think we should just have all parents sign off on a little form when they buy their game that's mature rated

482
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:10,780
that says, I fully acknowledge the content in this game is inappropriate for anybody under the age of 17.

483
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:21,780
Now I am wholly responsible if anybody under the age of 17 is playing this in my presence and any actions that result of them playing this.

484
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:22,780
And then when they go,

485
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:25,780
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT THAT GAME WAS VIOLENT

486
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:28,780
even though with big content warnings on the front,

487
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:29,780
I'm gonna see you and they're like,

488
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:31,780
Fuck you! You signed the contract!

489
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:33,780
Shove it up your ass.

490
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:38,780
You wanna know what's funny is that I deal with that daily since I work in the mortgage industry?

491
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:42,780
I didn't know that I had to have insurance on my house.

492
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:45,780
BITCH! You signed that form! You gotta have insurance!

493
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:47,780
Same thing, I think that's a great idea.

494
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:52,780
I think there should be disclaimers that people sign when they buy adult-only and M-rated games.

495
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:56,780
That is a brilliant idea. We should definitely write our Congressman to lobby for that.

496
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:03,780
And the other thing, too, about Killer7, and I'd like to backtrack a little bit.

497
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:06,780
How they're saying that, you know, this has full-on sexist stuff.

498
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:09,780
Before the game even starts, there's a little warning that comes up.

499
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:14,780
This game contains violent content and some nudity.

500
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:20,040
parental discretion advised, you know, full on on there you have to hit a button to go

501
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:22,260
through it, okay?

502
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:26,060
What more, it's honestly, what more do these game companies need to do for you fucking

503
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:27,060
people?

504
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:32,040
Honestly, because, what, when's it gonna, what does it take for you to need to do your

505
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,040
own job?

506
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:37,740
I mean, what, what do they need to do before you start, you know, being responsible?

507
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:38,740
Nothing.

508
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:40,300
There's nothing they can do.

509
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:43,860
You want the government to come in and do your job for you so you can go kick back and

510
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:47,580
get drunk and wasted and stuff and have more kids probably the same way you had

511
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:54,100
your kids in the first place so what comes down to is when I have my kids I'll

512
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,980
be watching what they're playing and honestly I don't mind if they play the

513
00:39:56,980 --> 00:40:00,420
mature games because I'll be teaching them difference between right and wrong

514
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:05,500
in the first place and they know that this is a game it's fictional it's not

515
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:09,900
does not play in the real world it's just like a fantasy movie the end that's

516
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:12,100
That's what it's going to come down to.

517
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:15,340
I really think in the end it really has more to do...

518
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:18,680
You know, also these parents need to give their kids a little bit more credit.

519
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:21,480
Your children are not stupid in most cases.

520
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:24,580
They only become stupid after you teach them how to be.

521
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:29,420
You know, your children are most likely going to know the difference between fiction and

522
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:30,420
reality.

523
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:34,820
And if they don't, then you need to take them to the psychologist or you need to go to parenting

524
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:36,240
school or something.

525
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,660
Because then there's some seriously messed up issues.

526
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:42,800
But in the end, parents need to give their children a little bit more credit and they

527
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:46,440
need to take more responsibility for what their children do, for what their children

528
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,440
learn.

529
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,240
That's called parenting.

530
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:53,080
Letting the government do it, lobbying, you know, they're spending all this, you know,

531
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:56,700
it's almost like that episode of South Park, you remember, when they were trying to take

532
00:40:56,700 --> 00:41:02,320
Terrence and Phillip off the air, and their children were talking about getting into drugs

533
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:08,000
and I hear smoking crack is kinda cute, you know, and watching porn movies while their

534
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:13,200
parents backs were turned and they were so busy focusing on this one issue you

535
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:17,000
know that's not parenting you need to actually take an active part in your

536
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:22,560
children's lives and say hey this is what I think that they should do this is

537
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,880
how I feel they should be raised that's the end of it I know we're kind of going

538
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:29,520
off on this one but it's a really I think a repeating theme for the show

539
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:37,760
don't you yeah and I think on that note we'll call this episode of Orange

540
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:42,760
I like fire, and reject false icons.

541
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:46,760
I like fire and reject false icons.
