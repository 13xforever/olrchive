274	2957	Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of August 15th, 2005.
3078	13550	You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.
13791	17195	Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
18755	28237	Hello, once again, everybody, and welcome to another edition of Orange Lounge Radio To Go, your home for discussion on video games that don't suck.
28677	32317	It's all the news you really want to know about here on Orange Lounge Radio.
32837	35718	And big thank you to those of you guys who helped us.
35778	39379	I know you mentioned this, Loki, last week, but since I wasn't here last week, I'm back, by the way.
39419	39679	Hello.
40319	42659	They shipped him back.
42839	43939	Let's introduce ourselves.
44279	45179	My name is Rob Roberts.
45199	46160	You might know me as Sky.
46240	48060	Joining me is DarkSakura.
49016	52118	How did you get through all the packing tape and the bubble wrap?
52238	52939	Very slowly.
52979	54099	That's why I was gone two weeks.
55360	56241	Ah, it took you that long.
56381	58342	I just thought that they just got tired and shipped you back.
59183	60103	Possibly a little bit of that.
60483	61604	And the one and only Loki.
61964	62445	I am here.
63065	63465	Yes, you are.
64086	65567	All right, so we were...
67458	70161	We were kind of in an interesting position last week.
70201	79592	Since I wasn't here, Loki and DarkSakura couldn't use the regular studio, so they effectively had to record last week's show through two tin cans and a piece of string or something like that.
79792	80893	No, seriously.
80913	82295	A laptop and a headset.
82315	83276	A laptop and a headset.
83737	86740	And I had to edit in stuff, so don't complain.
87521	91963	So if you're wondering why last week's show sounded a little bit different, it's because it wasn't in the usual studio.
92003	92644	But you know what, kids?
92684	95385	That's how dedicated we are to giving you new material every week.
95705	98587	Some shows would have just said, oh, screw it, we're going to take the week off.
99107	99707	Nope, not us.
100928	101168	Not us.
102423	105106	Anyway, I just want to personally thank... I know Loki thanked last week.
105126	110791	I want to personally thank you guys for helping us out with the podcast awards and getting us a win over there for Best Gaming Podcast.
110811	111852	That's amazing.
111892	112413	That's incredible.
112593	114054	I can't even... Wow.
114395	123183	I mean, this podcast was originally supposed to be the little side show that we figured, oh, maybe a couple people will download it, the ones that listen to our three-hour show, and it'll be cute.
123664	124825	But now this thing is just like...
125385	126305	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
154127	155248	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
183546	186012	Send those to DarkSakura.
186092	186333	Okay.
187596	189560	See, I knew that would change your mind a little bit.
189986	195651	It would be Jamie spelled J-A-M-I-E, not J-A-I-M-E.
195751	196391	Hello!
196591	197532	Or J-A-M-Y.
197592	198393	No, no, no.
198473	200114	Actually, they've been misspelling my name.
200274	200975	Oh, well, yeah.
201395	202656	My name is on our website.
202716	203777	Freaking spell it right.
204277	208681	J-A-M-I-E at orangeloungeradio.com.
208841	209421	And they can send you money.
209441	211923	I'm taking my wedding presents and Amazon gift certificates.
212164	212524	All right.
213244	214125	Since I'm not registered anymore.
214145	215646	You'll have to let me know if you actually get anything.
215666	216267	That would be kind of cool.
216647	217608	That would be kind of cool.
217908	220430	So no other games in between there?
221651	225393	Well, I did play a couple things with Dan.
225433	226114	Nothing major.
226134	226935	I played some PSO.
227855	233259	Since I've been so busy trying to get my school stuff set up, I haven't been able to dedicate as much time to games.
233399	240705	Now, I hate to call you out on something, but you told me during the three-hour show tonight that you haven't been able to put down that Nintendogs five-minute demo.
240745	242726	You know, I played it five times.
242746	242866	What?
244447	244987	in the same day.
245087	246388	I thought you said you like burned it out.
246428	247208	You played it so much.
247308	251849	No, it's just I was getting frustrated because I kept playing Frisbee with the puppies and then I was like, oh, five minutes is up.
252009	252349	Bing!
253410	254570	Like, ah, I don't play with puppies.
254590	257191	You only have just like a little over a week to go.
257511	258271	A little over a week to go.
258291	259011	Puppies.
259971	261292	Loki, what's been going on in your gaming world?
261572	263012	I've been playing lots of games.
263572	264773	Mostly Burnout 3.
265693	266553	I love that game.
266873	267614	Every single minute.
268154	272795	I must look like some really hardcore crazy guy at my work because I bring my PlayStation to...
273399	273979	to work.
274640	275240	I set it up.
275300	279943	Within a 15-minute break, we play two races and disassemble it and take it back upstairs.
280023	280744	Who makes Burnout 3?
280904	281004	EA.
282545	284606	Are they paying you under the table to say good things about it?
284846	284946	No.
285246	285947	It's a great game, though.
286267	289889	But it's also, what's awesome about it is they've price reduced it already, so it's $19.99.
289929	291370	You can go out and get it.
292091	295833	I'm really anticipating Burnout Revenge, which is coming out in September, which will be awesome.
296705	304048	Other than that, I've been playing just a variety of import games from Taiko no Tatsujin for the PlayStation Portable, which is a lot of fun.
304728	310270	And then I've also been playing, I tried playing a little bit of Genji Dawn the Samurai, which is going to be coming out here in September.
311510	312351	Really looks cool.
312811	313691	I love that game.
313751	314752	It's just so pretty.
315332	318533	I just wish I could understand dialogue because I can't read Japanese, but whatever.
319093	321234	And then Namco X Capcom, which looks fantastic.
321994	323335	Disappointing, actually.
323395	323695	Really?
324275	327257	I thought it was going to be a cool role-playing game type thing.
327317	331079	It's a tactical RPG, and I don't like tactical RPGs.
331259	335182	When you say tactical RPG, you mean like Advance Wars, Final Fantasy Tactics style?
335202	337263	Like Final Fantasy Tactics, yeah, exactly.
338283	340285	I was expecting something different.
341425	342926	It looks, the intro movie's cool.
342986	344907	But you never got into Tactics or Disgaea?
345047	346008	Nope, I never did.
346228	347069	I don't like them.
347249	349490	I kind of like those games, so I've got to check this out.
350030	350370	I don't know.
350450	352411	But it'll be cool when it comes out over here.
352712	353632	And we love Katamari.
353912	355053	I've been loving that game.
356233	359035	I'm going to be playing this week 187 Ride or Die.
359335	361056	Oh, I tried Seven Sins too this week.
362316	365218	It's like The Sims 2, just with nudity.
366717	368418	Honestly, it's exactly like it.
369078	370780	It's really interesting and very annoying.
371240	373261	Seven Sins.
373482	375443	I'm sure that made Jack Thompson a very happy man.
376044	376904	Well, it's in Europe.
377144	377845	What's he going to do?
377985	379826	Tell the Europeans to stop their games?
379846	380787	They don't care about nudity.
380807	382288	Stop being naked all the time.
384250	387312	Next week, though, I'm playing 187 Ride or Die in Darkwatch for sure.
388426	415770	you got a busy busy gaming schedule I wish my list of games was as impressive but sadly since I've been traveling all I've had is handhelds I finally bought my own copy of Luminous because it's this long going story if you've listened to the podcast for several weeks now I bought a copy of Luminous before I had the PSP my friend accidentally took it one weekend I ended up just giving it to him as a birthday present because he loved it so much and I finally went and bought my own copy while I was traveling since I was on the east coast for a couple weeks um
416230	422272	I went to a DDR tournament while I was out on the East Coast and I played a new game called Percussion Master, which is pretty cool.
422292	426833	It's like a cross between Taiko no Tatooine and Drum Mania, if you're familiar with those games.
427333	430874	Taiko Drum Master was the American name of Taiko no Tatooine.
431674	432534	Pretty cool game.
432714	433194	I liked it.
433295	434455	I loved the song list.
434535	435215	It was fun.
435915	438856	But it's a game that I think might wear thin a little quickly because...
439264	439944	Thank you for watching!
459657	461518	Otherwise, I've just been playing a lot of handheld games.
462059	469344	I actually tried, I kind of forced myself to try and play some DS games that I originally had given negatives reviews for on the show.
469384	470405	One of them being Polarium.
470905	472767	Sorry kids, still can't get into Polarium.
473067	474208	Yoshi Touch and Go.
475356	478718	After playing Kirby Canvas Curse, it kind of has a dual effect.
478818	492364	I'm able to understand Yoshi Touch and Go more, and I'm able to get a little better at it and have a little more fun with it, but to me, it still feels like you're paying a full price for a game for just a two-level game, and I still can't recommend Yoshi Touch and Go.
492444	495605	I say, if you want a game like that, just get Kirby Canvas Curse.
495645	497046	It's a much more solid game.
497566	498826	So really, it's just been about the handhelds.
499206	500107	I still need pack picks.
500851	501631	One thing I want to bring up.
501731	503592	Oh, I still need to check out Pack Picks.
503952	505753	I want to check out Pack and Roll too when that comes out.
506373	507313	Pack and Roll is fun.
507854	509574	One thing I want to definitely mention about PSPs.
509774	516717	I used to kind of bash the whole UMD movies on PSP thing as not being a very good idea as what's the point.
517057	523381	I'll tell you what, after five hour flights on Southwest, PSP movies have become my favorite thing ever.
523441	531025	I'm so happy that my friend SharksGirl, who's been on some of our three hour programs on OrangeLodgeRadio.com, she loaned me some movies.
531085	535567	I finally saw Tron for the first time on PSP and I saw a movie called I, Robot with Will Smith.
536107	536928	Both great movies.
537388	540010	And I seriously should trademark this idea or something before somebody steals it.
559745	561987	and I think I might have mentioned this on a three hour show or something before.
562027	565569	I'm going to say it again because this is very apparent to me after doing a lot of traveling this weekend.
566149	571873	Somebody should start like a rental service for PSP movies in airports.
572597	574559	and have these places in all these airports?
574579	575901	It's called Altatoons.
576221	579064	Do they rent UMDs though?
579344	579885	They do?
580105	581527	I think they rent and sell DVDs.
581567	582588	I thought they only sold them.
582808	584470	Well, I'm pretty sure they do.
584530	587093	I know they are starting to do UMD games also.
587113	588354	Interesting.
589055	590216	I know there's some place that
590774	594095	All the tunes I want to say is one of them, but I can't remember if they rent or sell.
594475	599896	I want to say they do rent, though, because you can return them to other Ultatoon stores in different airports.
600396	603097	See, something like that for UMDs, I bet would make it killing.
603637	607117	Maybe not right away, but when PSPs really catch on, I think it would be a great idea.
607538	610078	They love those portable games, man.
610478	616659	If Ultatoon adopts that idea, they need to send me a dollar or something for giving the idea.
616859	619260	Anyway, let's get into some gaming news tonight, boys and girls.
620140	621841	Starting off with QuakeCon.
621902	625424	QuakeCon just happened recently and I heard that there were some new movies shown for Quake 4.
626085	629067	I haven't gotten a chance to see this, but apparently the Quake fans are all excited.
629128	632971	Somebody in chat during the live program this week was really excited about Quake 4.
633011	633411	I have seen them.
633611	634172	What did you think?
634672	635433	They were interesting.
636494	639156	Quake, though, is starting to look more like Halo.
639196	640817	Well, I wonder why.
641938	642879	It's not surprising.
642899	645321	It's running on the new Doom 3 engine, which is nice.
647767	652210	The movie that I saw looks like an all-out war right now.
652431	656254	You're in the trenches with this one guy and you're shooting these other things.
656274	658075	You see gunfire going up overhead.
658175	659397	It looks like Halo 2, basically.
665623	665923	I don't know.
666063	666643	It looks good though.
666843	670305	Here's what I thought was a really cool piece of information that also came out of QuakeCon.
670405	676327	John Carmack actually announced that the Quake 3 source code is going to be released.
677027	680088	Now, remember what the Doom source code release has done for us.
680148	682749	I mean, now we've got like Doom on the iPod and all this crazy stuff.
682769	684129	This is going to be pretty cool.
684249	685070	Quake 3 source.
686050	688131	I'm just wanting to see what they would turn it into.
688951	691692	Yeah, I'm kind of curious to see what kind of side projects come out of this.
691812	693693	Loki, you're kind of more in the hack and crack thing.
693733	694513	Is this going to be a huge...
695475	696536	What do you think about the Quake 3 source?
711670	712651	Couldn't hurt, definitely.
714252	716393	Let's talk about PSP and the firmware.
716413	717754	There's brand new firmware coming out.
717814	721716	It's actually going to come out today, August 15th, the day that our show is released.
722016	731262	It was supposed to be out a couple days ago, but they just have to wait a little bit because I guess there were some recent bugs to fix or something.
731602	740327	Just a reminder, the PSP firmware 2.0 will have that new web browser application which lets you browse the internet on your PSP from anywhere.
742079	742899	Wireless Hotspot.
743039	744020	So that's going to be pretty cool.
744320	746241	Also enhanced video and audio playback.
746261	753346	They're saying photo sharing options, broader network connectivity, and a more customizable interface.
753406	754727	So a lot of people looking forward to 2.0.
755148	760811	But of course, the downside to that, if you upgrade, say goodbye to the NES emulator for a little while.
760871	761552	At least until
762618	764760	You know they're going to find a way around the 2.0 fix.
764780	765801	They're working on it already.
765861	766462	Give it time.
766722	767402	I'm sure it'll happen.
767563	772066	Honestly though, if you're going to be upgrading because of a web browser, just wait.
772227	773808	Because they're already working on web browsers.
773848	774889	Hell, there's four already.
775329	775830	I mean, what?
776030	778592	If you really want to use a web browser, there's always Wipeout.
778972	780814	And there's already two other ones that they're working on.
780994	788641	Yes, but when they release a really popular game for PSP, like let's say the new Grand Theft Auto game, don't you think these games are going to force you to go to 2.0?
789264	794166	No, because what they'll do is they'll just dump the ISO of the game, and then you'll just be able to run it.
795066	799608	Okay, heaven forbid there should be people out there in the world that buy their games legally.
800748	806570	Okay, yes, you can still buy the game legally, but you can use your own software to dump the game and then run it on your memory card.
807725	808005	Kid Icarus
834828	838090	I'll be bringing up a Sony anti-piracy story a little later, which I'm sure you'll love.
838410	841491	But in the meantime, let's hear what's going on in the hack and crack world.
841651	843432	Well, glad you asked.
843832	848434	Because we're getting closer and closer to porting Linux to everything.
848574	851475	So why not start with the PSP?
851575	852936	Of course, it's not really ported.
853216	854316	It's just emulated.
854376	856737	So we have the x86 emulator.
857058	860219	And for those not to know, it's basically a PC emulator, you know.
860728	861168	x86 is emulated
871198	874820	You could run Oregon Trail on your PSP.
895379	895859	I don't know.
895959	896339	I'm just kidding.
896359	898220	Well, if it did, they have an emulator for that, too.
898300	899100	It's going to come out.
899240	902422	Eventually, you'll be able to play Oregon Trail on the PSP.
902502	902942	Hooray!
904142	905703	After all, that's what we're working towards, right?
905723	906363	That's exactly.
906583	908544	I don't give a shit about Halo 3.
909324	911185	I want Oregon Trail on the PSP.
911645	912685	You missed it, though.
912705	917147	Our live show two weeks ago, we had my good friend Kasumi19 on the show.
917787	920548	By the end of the show, she was playing Oregon Trail on her laptop.
920808	921028	See?
921729	922189	Smart woman.
922929	923229	Uh-huh.
923350	926271	Other stuff that's going on in the world of the PSP.
927232	930474	Someone actually made a home version of Kaboom for the PSP.
930594	931315	Rock on.
931835	932315	Rock on.
932355	934116	Kaboom was like the best Atari 2600 game.
934156	934437	So simple.
937285	943446	So simple, the concept of the game, but I remember being five years old and just being totally obsessed with Kaboom.
943506	944687	Well, don't get too excited yet.
944807	945947	It's still got tons of bugs.
945987	947747	It's the first game this guy's programmed.
947787	951888	It's programmed in a language called Lua, which you can actually program homebrew games.
951948	953369	Pretty simple for your PSP.
953529	956529	Okay, plus also the fact that it doesn't have that little dial controller.
956649	962151	I'm sorry, no other controller works the same as those little dial controllers that you had for Breakout and stuff.
962731	963631	It'll ruin it for me.
964211	964351	Yeah.
964955	976401	so you've got that so that's one thing you can look at the other thing is this operating system or I should say a GUI that they're making called P6 which is going to be able to run homebrew stuff and all that wonderful
977406	980448	Plus, they're talking about random wallpapers and yadda yadda yadda.
981048	983369	And then my favorite, Scorched Earth.
983409	987811	PSP's got a version .9 released right now.
987871	989452	They've got more stuff being worked on.
990132	991713	A scoring system, that sort of thing.
991793	992893	But it's getting closer.
993454	994354	Getting closer.
994374	996355	With all due respect, fuck worms.
996415	997856	It's all about Scorched Earth.
998896	1000017	So, yeah.
1000077	1006640	Now, away from the PSP stuff, we've got Scum, which was that wonderful engine that ran Maniac Mansion in
1007492	1011575	My favorite game, Monkey Island, the secret of Monkey Island, came to the DS.
1012056	1013117	Perfect.
1013597	1017160	I can't believe that'd be awesome to try that out on the DS with a touchscreen.
1017781	1032292	It runs fantastic from what I hear, and there's info on that on this nintendo-ds.dcmu.com.uk I know, no one's going to get that, but anyways, it's out there.
1032312	1033473	Rewind, listen again.
1033894	1034674	Okay, cool.
1035335	1036256	Yeah, so...
1037236	1037997	Really cool stuff.
1038217	1038638	Very cool.
1038658	1043784	Alright, let's go to DarkSakura, who's got a story for us about... Well, what is this about, really?
1044471	1055457	Well, it's put out by BBC News, and I'm glad somebody, especially a prominent source like BBC, has pointed out that parents ignore game age ratings.
1055617	1056318	Surprise!
1056658	1057358	Big surprise.
1057959	1065243	A study commissioned by the UK games industry found that parents let their children play games for adults, even though they know they are 18 rated.
1065723	1068865	To quote Juergen Freund, he's a Modulum researcher,
1070106	1074209	Most parents think that their child is mature enough so that these games will not influence them.
1075010	1078733	Parents perceive age ratings as a guide but not as a definite prohibition.
1079774	1087962	There was a case where when the parents of a 14-year-old blamed the game Manhunt for his death.
1089123	1093487	And the police investigated it and dismissed it as part of the case.
1093567	1095229	You know, I'm fine with a parent...
1095609	1096530	Thank you for watching!
1125791	1129152	Careless parents with careless children that screwed up for everybody else.
1130433	1135515	There's also a notice on here that between January 2003 and July 2004, 16 out of the 1,208 games on sale in the UK were given an 18-plus certificate.
1135595	1137476	How well did those 16 games sell, though, I wonder?
1145111	1154680	Well, they actually interviewed about a thousand UK adults and a further 100 were questioned after buying a video game that was for 18 up.
1156081	1160605	Of course, a comment from a couple of the people, because they allow you to give comments back on this.
1161426	1165489	To allow an underage child to play an 18 plus rated game is irresponsible parenting.
1170222	1170902	I disagree.
1172003	1177444	I bet the same person would take their child to an R-rated movie if they screened it first, or if they knew something about it.
1177824	1192028	And I think if a parent knows a little something about the game, although of course this story talks about ignoring ratings, but I think if the parent knows that their child can differentiate between violence in a video game and violence in the real world, I think that's a parent's decision.
1193621	1200050	There's also another one on here that says, often media hype builds games up to be worse than they are.
1201021	1201822	Thank you!
1202302	1203223	Oh, yeah, hello.
1203763	1204284	Absolutely.
1205585	1213792	I think back to, remember we read a story a couple weeks ago on air about the blind guy who was playing games and kicking people's ass in Soul Calibur 2?
1214473	1220418	And the media said that he'd play Soul Calibur 2 and decapitate people in the game, which is not something you do in that game.
1221059	1223481	Actually, I want to go ahead and read his quote in full, if I may.
1223661	1223841	Sure.
1224582	1225963	The guy's name is Kenny's from Nottingham.
1226823	1229825	The violence in video games is often of a cartoon nature.
1230225	1237308	The outcry over Manhunt was laughable because the game was rubbish and wouldn't have sold at all but for the furor in the press.
1238168	1244491	Often media hype builds games up to be worse than they are, and by doing so makes them a must-have game that they do not deserve to be.
1244911	1251034	Grand Theft Auto San Andreas is no different in theme to its two predecessors, but its notoriety ensured its success.
1252270	1252910	Very interesting.
1253151	1253811	I have something.
1254271	1255372	Okay, Loki, you have something to add?
1255392	1257013	I have something to add to this.
1257254	1259275	There's also kind of a related story.
1260456	1268602	There was a study done in the University of Illinois, and they found no strong link between violent video games and aggression.
1269522	1280290	They basically did a survey watching players play this game, Astro's Call 2, a popular MMORPG, and basically saying that the results were that
1280916	1281837	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1311491	1316593	All these age prevention things for mature games, it's all programmed into the consoles.
1316633	1318773	You can lock out content.
1318793	1320234	You have to have a code to get into it.
1320374	1322274	Yeah, you can lock this stuff out for your kids.
1322294	1329756	So if you're worried about your kids playing games because you're not supervising them, which you should be doing in the first place, you can lock this stuff out.
1330136	1335198	It's on every single console system, I think from the PlayStation up through the PSP now.
1335882	1338084	It's just... It's ridiculous.
1338104	1338464	Wow.
1338644	1349393	There's also one parent who replied on this one that talks about how the kids are swapping games with each other too and so they even don't have any control over that because their kids are taking the initiative.
1349413	1351515	That's a very interesting point but at the same time...
1352028	1355869	The parents should still be aware of what games their kids are playing.
1356789	1360650	There's another comment on here, just the last one I'm going to read, by Vicky in Glasgow.
1361250	1367111	She says, I definitely agree with the idea that an 18-plus certificate on a game makes it more desirable.
1367771	1373272	My stepson is instantly drawn to the game that he is not allowed to play, and it is a problem amongst his peers.
1373812	1381734	In fact, it makes an even greater problem when they are allowed to play these games at friends' houses with the blessing of friends' parents, but without our knowledge or consent.
1382296	1383617	Very interesting point there.
1383777	1384437	Kids are sneaky.
1384878	1389260	Very interesting point as well that the mature rating makes us want to play the games more.
1390841	1393242	Think about would anybody have ever bought the guy game?
1393983	1394443	Seriously.
1395503	1396704	They call it the sweet 18 in Europe.
1396744	1398285	Basically, 18 plus games sell better.
1398305	1398505	18 sweet.
1398525	1398625	Sweet.
1406482	1407044	Let's move on.
1407084	1409310	I want to mention something going on in another MMO.
1409651	1412118	Asheron's Call 2 got brought up in that previous story.
1412499	1413923	EverQuest 2, I want to mention this.
1414602	1426046	Apparently there was a big group of hackers that illegally created currency in EverQuest 2 and ended up causing the game's economy to suffer by 20% in just 24 hours.
1426146	1427907	Of course, then they finally got caught.
1428667	1438130	Chris Kramer, the director of public relations for EverQuest 2, said that they had a duping bug that made large quantities of platinum the game's currency.
1439231	1441951	The amount of money in the game was increased by a fifth in about 24 hours.
1441971	1442031	Hmm.
1443885	1444586	Very interesting.
1445867	1448470	So that's that.
1449310	1458299	EverQuest 2 is not a game that I've really played a whole lot, but I guess if you do play that game, that must have sucked to have that happen.
1458319	1462804	It's kind of strange thinking of a virtual environment as having its own economy.
1463860	1464602	I know, I know.
1464782	1468209	You know, when you stop and just think about that, it's like, oh my god.
1468229	1471495	But it's a huge part of any MMO.
1471535	1475503	Wow has its economy, Final Fantasy Labyrinth, any of them.
1476623	1480245	But actually, PSO, though, really doesn't.
1481726	1483187	Because there's no auction house in PSO.
1483607	1484127	Exactly.
1484708	1494673	You have game-controlled shops, and basically the only way to really... Players can sell stuff to each other, but that's really the only way to do it.
1494693	1497975	It's more of a barter system, and so there's no real economy to manipulate there.
1499596	1501857	I prefer that, actually, over the auction house thing.
1502536	1509459	Actually, they did limit the total amount of currency you can hold in Blue Burst compared to the Xbox.
1510580	1520224	Just an FYI, because I don't want to get any hate mail over this, the economy of the game was brought back to normal after the thing was discovered, so if you're an EverQuest 2 player, everything's A-OK.
1520264	1521804	You can go back to your EverQuesting now.
1521924	1523445	Enjoy your crack and your Slash Pizza.
1523525	1525366	Enjoy your EverCrack and your Slash Pizza.
1526761	1527822	I hope I don't mispronounce this.
1527862	1528122	Yannick?
1549730	1562479	Hey guys, regarding the media player that Loki mentioned on the last podcast, I have purchased the original media player back when I first got my PlayStation 2, and didn't really know what to expect since it came from Mad Catz, and I have a bad history with them.
1562879	1571605	However, this product is very reliable if your computer is fast enough to stream the video over to your PS2, and if the video is at the 320x240 resolution.
1572105	1577909	So basically going over this saying that Java stuff's buggy, but the Mad Catz one worked just fine.
1579562	1579962	Alrighty.
1580243	1583645	The one I was talking about, though, it's a little different than the media player he was talking about.
1583685	1588068	The one I talked about was actually streaming stuff off the PlayStation hard drive that you put in there.
1588509	1590950	So, similar, but I think you can do the same type of thing.
1593252	1595234	Any other emails you want to share?
1595254	1603500	Um, we also got one from someone named Blake, who writes us from Atlanta, Georgia.
1603520	1605181	Hotlanta!
1606337	1608198	Hey, I've been to Atlanta plenty of times.
1608258	1611319	I used to stay with relatives over in Alpharetta.
1612460	1613861	I got cousins in Augusta.
1614421	1615721	Although that's a bit of a drive from there.
1617562	1620043	You just started listening to our show a few weeks ago.
1620144	1620684	Great job.
1621084	1622965	You're one of the two podcasts I listen to.
1624061	1625401	What's the other one?
1625721	1626302	No, I'm just kidding.
1626702	1627702	I'm quoting.
1627962	1631223	Well, anyways, listen to your latest show when you were ranting about the game ratings.
1631283	1632483	I completely agree with you guys.
1632623	1634883	I'm 13 and my parents let me play any game I want.
1635423	1641405	Back when I was around 3 years old, my dad talked to me about game ratings and told me it was all fake and just a game.
1642265	1644425	Been playing Doom since I was 2, literally.
1644965	1647946	The only games they don't let me play are the ones with nudity and sex.
1648186	1652427	I'm stuck playing my God of War demo for PS2 since I can't get God of War due to the threesome.
1653027	1655188	Luckily, the GTA games never appealed to me.
1655268	1662352	I think you guys should talk more about the money since there's a lot of news coming up lately and I'm a huge fan of DDR and every other music game ever created.
1662813	1666595	I think that you should go to the PTA meetings and tell parents they aren't doing their jobs.
1668361	1669422	That's what we talked about last week.
1669442	1669842	That's great.
1669882	1670322	That's great.
1671142	1674624	We said we were going to march up on the PTA meetings and say, hey!
1674824	1681006	That's really interesting about the fact that the dad had to talk with him when he was really young, and that's good.
1681467	1686769	But you know what else is really good about that is that, you know, how would the parents know the God of War has a threesome?
1686809	1689410	What's to stop this kid from going out and getting the game?
1690183	1692606	and just saying, oh, that means the parents did their work.
1692927	1693407	Exactly.
1693688	1699034	You know, Blake, tell your parents that they are doing a fabulous job and they get the DarkSakura seal of approval.
1699154	1699655	There you go.
1699995	1702538	But I think Blake sounds mature enough where he can handle little boobs.
1702599	1703219	They're just boobs.
1703440	1704561	They're pixelated boobs.
1704601	1705362	I mean, come on, they're fake.
1705482	1706003	They're just boobs.
1708185	1715027	I really need to point out this family as a prime example of doing it the right way.
1715347	1721169	And on top of that, most kids are smart enough that they know the difference between what's real and what's not.
1721789	1724890	It's a polygon representation of boobs.
1725810	1727150	They aren't really fleshy boobs.
1727731	1728851	You have to wait a few years for that.
1730251	1731892	Do you have another email you want to read, DarkSakura?
1732543	1733204	I know I have one.
1733304	1734845	I have one I definitely want to throw in here.
1735586	1737007	Somebody sent an email.
1737288	1746576	Noah is the name, or N for short, and was mentioning that I'm getting back into Final Fantasy XI at some point and was inviting me to come play on the fairy server with them.
1747857	1753383	I know because I used to make jokes about the fairy server on the three-hour show.
1753463	1754784	The fairy server.
1755264	1756486	It has nothing to do with you.
1757166	1758527	A kind person who wrote this email.
1758607	1761129	It goes back to this whole LiveJournal drama thing.
1761349	1762130	RPG goddess.
1762150	1766133	People who roleplay on Final Fantasy XI.
1767874	1768174	I'm sorry.
1768194	1768875	I take that back.
1769115	1773138	Not that there's anything wrong with roleplaying on Final Fantasy XI, but people who take it a little bit too far.
1773778	1774539	So that is wrong.
1775279	1778842	There's nothing wrong as long as you know the difference between reality and Final Fantasy XI.
1780123	1780583	You know what?
1780703	1780964	I would...
1781704	1788690	And this person says that they've been playing since the US PlayStation 2 release and they're a level 22 slash 11 warrior monk.
1788931	1795376	And they got in there and this person's inviting me because they don't seem to know a whole lot of people that actually play the game as well.
1796437	1797598	I totally appreciate the invite.
1797638	1797939	That's great.
1797959	1805225	And I actually had a character on the Ferry server for a little while because there's a large contingent on there that I like playing the games with.
1805706	1805806	And...
1806621	1807162	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1826120	1831324	So I really appreciate the invite, but if I go back to the game, I'm going to have to go back to my family at Bismarck.
1831584	1837148	However, if you would like to come on over to the Bismarck server with us, that's assuming if I even get back into the game in the first place.
1837168	1838269	I still haven't decided on that.
1838869	1843073	Send me an email, rob at orangelaundry.com, and I'll get you a world pass onto Bismarck.
1843793	1849437	And plus, you can still add me to your play online list, and we can send messages back and forth and talk about how the economy on our servers suck.
1849758	1851199	So thank you for the invite.
1851219	1852800	I uninstalled play online.
1853481	1853981	I know you did.
1854505	1854605	P.S.
1854645	1854745	Opium
1879898	1880979	Thank you for writing us.
1881099	1882060	Yeah, I appreciate the email.
1882220	1886424	Loki, you have a story about the DS and it's going to get cheaper soon, right?
1886524	1886704	Yep.
1887004	1889186	What's going on with that?
1889226	1890887	It's going to be dropping by $20 to $130.
1891388	1894290	And they're saying around August 21st is when that's going to happen.
1894811	1898034	And the other thing is, well, what's Sony going to do then?
1898214	1902397	They're thinking about... Because I know the PlayStation 2 is dropping down to $99 pretty soon.
1903238	1903538	Nice.
1904079	1905460	And they're hoping...
1906210	1910913	That's going to steal some of Xbox 360's thunder, right?
1911474	1913235	I don't think so.
1913715	1915036	So yeah, that's going to be happening.
1915717	1919799	But hey, cheaper DS, Nintendogs, that's not a bad combo.
1919959	1920520	Puppies!
1920660	1921801	I think they're kind of smart.
1921841	1923662	I think they're really pushing this Nintendogs thing.
1923702	1928165	I know we have not shut up about this game on the show for several weeks, but there's a reason for that, guys.
1928225	1928605	This game is...
1931622	1932623	It's the next Pokemon.
1932843	1934144	Next Pokemon, I tell ya.
1934544	1935025	I think so too.
1935225	1937066	And wait till the commercials come.
1937267	1944212	Wait till the commercials come and the little puppies come up on the screen and the little girls are, Daddy, Daddy, I want that game!
1944272	1945473	I want the puppy game!
1945513	1946193	Puppy game!
1946474	1947554	Alright.
1947575	1949136	Thank you for blasting our speakers, everybody.
1951337	1953079	Are you loading up the Nintendogs demo right now?
1953139	1954460	I'm putting in the puppies.
1954480	1956501	Alright, let me do another Nintendo story where you're loading that up.
1958803	1959724	Oh, I can barely hear it.
1963615	1964856	I don't think they heard that at home.
1964896	1965776	Maybe a little bit.
1966517	1973942	Anyway, Nintendo is actually needing some help trying to get their new Wi-Fi network up in place.
1974483	1977945	Basically what it is, is they're asking that folks do a short little test.
1978265	1983649	It's a simple survey and a download on Nintendo.com.
1983669	1991535	Basically what happens is that it's going to ask for information on your internet connection and all the download does is it just pings Nintendo's servers.
1992155	1998098	and to kind of entice you to do it, it doubles as a Animal Crossing themed desktop clock.
1998518	1999878	So, you know, a little cute thing there.
2000198	2000719	That's cool.
2000899	2016925	Yeah, and basically what they're saying here on Nintendo's website, it says, by gathering information on which types of networking equipment our customers are using and how they have their home network set up, we'll be able to tailor the Nintendo Wi-Fi connection to be easy to use and available to the broadest audience possible.
2017603	2045915	well that's awfully considerate of them also the FAQ also says by the end of 2005 Nintendo DS owners will be able to play via Wi-Fi Mario Kart DS and Animal Crossing DS so if you want to help Nintendo out you want to help those guys out head on over to Nintendo.com and download the Animal Crossing desktop I forgot to mention coming in this fall when they do the price drop they're going to be offering a Nintendo DS package where you can get the DS plus Metro Prime Hunters not the demo
2046967	2049229	Metro Prime Hunters for $150.
2050090	2052212	Any more colors?
2052332	2053813	I'm surprised we haven't really heard any.
2054994	2056695	No, just that blue and red.
2056755	2057656	I think that was it.
2057816	2061199	I want the graphite one because the graphite one is cool.
2062320	2063201	I'm kind of surprised.
2063241	2065262	I'm surprised that we're even getting excited about colors.
2065342	2066503	There will be more colors.
2066584	2067104	Don't worry.
2067624	2068685	Where's the clear one?
2068745	2069806	That's what I'm surprised about.
2069846	2072669	All those first advanced, the Game Boy Advance, remember the old one?
2072689	2073669	They were all clear.
2073689	2074790	I don't know.
2075391	2075611	Anyway.
2075919	2076279	DarkSakura.com
2095294	2112985	Alright kids, you know what we gotta do now at this point is that we need DarkSakura to give you guys a little piece of her mind in the formative advice column because if we talked about video games all the time on this show, we would have no time to go around and find out the dark lives of strippers.
2113306	2116307	And those of you guys that listen to the three hour show know exactly what we're talking about.
2116528	2117728	The dark side is bleach.
2118189	2121831	And if you don't know what we're talking about, you should start listening.
2122682	2125103	Sunday nights, 6.30, 9.30 Pacific Standard Time.
2125523	2129325	Anyway, DarkSakura, what are you going to talk to us about on this podcast?
2130245	2133267	Today's bit of advice is how to deal with a stalker.
2133647	2137308	This is dedicated to my stalker, BlairIsKing on DDR Free.
2138109	2138589	Bravo.
2139830	2145212	Number one, firmly inform the stalker that if the unwanted behavior persists, you will take action.
2145856	2151739	Threaten to contact authorities or be a larger, stronger friend or relative.
2152159	2153319	Be prepared to do so.
2153780	2161984	Do not give in to any threats and be ready to secure a restraining order or civil protection order if it becomes necessary for your peace of mind.
2162504	2165025	Inform your family, friends, and co-workers of the situation.
2166346	2167086	Keep a paper trail.
2168035	2170817	Save any relevant letters, notes, emails, and voicemails.
2171217	2176701	Maintain a log or diary of your stalker's actions and report any unlawful behavior to the police immediately.
2177221	2181263	Report phone calls to both the phone company and the police.
2181684	2182504	Inform authorities.
2182924	2186106	Do not let fear of retribution stop you from taking action.
2186267	2187768	Take legal action immediately.
2188368	2189889	But my final piece of advice?
2190529	2191230	No means no?
2192450	2193091	Piss off!
2196850	2199473	Megaman Battle Network 6 How much cooler is that name?
2218273	2218613	I don't know.
2219414	2219894	But they are.
2219994	2221655	Capcom, this is one reason I bring it up.
2221695	2225176	Capcom is saying that Battle Network 6 will be the series climax.
2225757	2228478	Possibly suggesting that it will be the last.
2228938	2234120	Good, then they can get back to making more Mega Man Legend games.
2234240	2235561	Because those games rock.
2235901	2237882	By the way, Legends is coming to the PSP.
2238742	2241584	I just want more Mega Man X. I forgot about that.
2241624	2242504	I'm totally going to have to get that.
2242564	2243565	And I want it all 2D.
2245308	2251933	Also in the world of Captain Obvious Presents, Zelda will be made for the revolution.
2252013	2253214	I mean, come on, duh.
2254375	2257397	And in other news, there will be a Mario game for the revolution.
2257577	2258598	No, that's not official.
2258758	2260939	And there will probably be a Donkey Kong game.
2260959	2261560	That's not official.
2261740	2263061	Stop spreading rumors.
2263281	2264022	Stop spreading rumors.
2265383	2267284	Metroid will make its way to the revolution.
2267304	2268645	And another Banjo-Kazooie.
2268766	2271488	This is the official news, kids.
2272529	2281676	And this is mentioned in an interview with game designer Ije Anuma in Club Nintendo, the company's official magazine in Latin America.
2282297	2288542	About Zelda on Revolution, Mr. Owada has assigned me with the task of doing a Zelda game for the upcoming platform.
2289423	2290824	And that is our Duh!
2291044	2291625	News of the Week.
2295267	2299569	DarkSakura, what's going on overseas for our friends in the UK?
2300150	2308454	Well, first of all, Electronic Arts is going to be bringing out Everybody Loves, or I'm sorry, We Love Katamari.
2308614	2310455	You were about to say Everybody Loves Katamari.
2310475	2312576	Well, I was thinking Mina Daisuke Katamari.
2312596	2313376	Oh, okay, that's fine.
2313837	2316318	Because that's how I came to think of it.
2316998	2318839	Yeah, Electronic Arts is going to be publishing that.
2318879	2322061	I don't actually see anything about the first Katamari Damacy, though.
2322904	2324865	Didn't they finally get it, but like way later?
2324965	2326665	I think, yeah, way later.
2326745	2334168	But at any rate, it's going to be by EA instead of Namco, which Namco is bringing out our version next month.
2334188	2334949	Hooray!
2336429	2339390	But now, EA typically does this for Namco.
2339410	2341711	There's a lot of their games that they have done overseas.
2342311	2346433	But this is just good news for our buddies in the UK that they will see this game sooner rather than later.
2347108	2350990	Well, there's a funny little parody picture that says, We love Katamari Street.
2352250	2354631	But with a big EA Games logo on it.
2355171	2359373	Hopefully that won't be the game coming out in the UK.
2359453	2373699	I love, though, if ever you look on the Japanese cover, and there's big scans of it online, all the Namco employees out in front of it, but if you look in the windows, reflected on the windows is the King of All Cosmos taking the picture.
2374460	2375161	Oh, that's cool.
2375501	2380046	You know, I didn't get a chance to say this since I wasn't here last week, but I hate the American box art.
2380407	2380927	It's awful.
2381268	2382229	I haven't seen it, actually.
2382389	2384772	It's kind of hidden in that parody graphic.
2385152	2385633	It's kind of hidden.
2385893	2387615	It's awful.
2387635	2392040	I hope it was just a mock-up done by some game company, because I did not care for the box art at all.
2392100	2393482	I've seen the box art.
2393642	2393762	It's...
2394261	2394721	Thanks for watching!
2412985	2414846	Any more UK news, DarkSakura?
2414986	2424471	Also, the game premiered on Yahoo UK and Ireland video games is The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe for PS2.
2426372	2430534	It's actually still in production, but the review of it is just...
2431457	2432297	Thank you for watching!
2453084	2453964	at the end, I guess.
2454184	2458426	Loki, you were telling me at some point that you had actually gotten to play this game, somehow, at E3?
2458466	2460847	Briefly, like five minutes worth.
2461767	2474492	It looked very interesting, and it reminded me very much of the Lord of the Rings game, just the way that it was, because it was kind of that isometric, top-down type of thing, and it looked pretty good.
2474712	2475833	I mean, it looked good.
2476013	2479414	I honestly don't remember much of the language in the wardrobe.
2479454	2482255	I read all the books, like, way back in elementary school, but...
2483610	2484410	Call of Cthulhu.
2484430	2485011	The official site is up.
2485031	2485471	CallofCthulhu.com
2500438	2501098	Coming out in September.
2501118	2502719	I was going to say, isn't that game coming out very soon?
2503959	2504760	Pretty soon.
2504780	2511742	I know I've been gushing about the game, but you can go to CallOfCthulhu.com to check out the official art.
2512723	2515104	Background on the Cthulhu myth.
2515284	2516404	There's downloads on there.
2516424	2516964	It's a great site.
2517925	2518205	Awesome.
2519707	2520107	Anything else?
2520987	2521647	One last thing.
2521707	2522448	Sure.
2522508	2534110	Not necessarily specifically related to the UK, but Koei, who was one of my favorite games ever, Keio Yugekitai, Keio Flying Squadron, back on the Sega CD.
2534450	2537691	And I remember them for Romance in Three Kingdoms.
2538571	2539791	Nobunaga's Ambition, that's it.
2540791	2543412	They were at Tokyo Game Show and announced their lineup.
2544231	2548913	and to quote my source, let's just say we hope you like Dynasty Warriors.
2550714	2556656	Coming out, we have Dynasty Warriors 5 Special working title for the Xbox 360 coming to Japan this winter.
2557336	2562118	We have Dynasty Warriors 5 Extreme Legends on PS2 September 15th in Japan.
2562698	2565560	Dynasty Warriors DS without a release date yet.
2566540	2568701	Outside of Dynasty Warriors, we also have...
2569561	2578465	Neo, Summer 2006, Winback 2, Project Poseidon, Romance of the Three Kingdoms for the DS, which will be September 2005.
2578846	2587490	And then also for the Japan-only releases, there's Uncharted Waters Online for PC and Nobunaga's Ambition Online.
2587930	2588730	Here you no show.
2589551	2591532	So they're bringing out a couple of MMOs.
2592292	2595033	Dynasty Warriors 5 for the PlayStation 2 is coming out in September.
2595454	2595734	Wow.
2596874	2597254	All right.
2597274	2597755	In the U.S.
2598335	2598555	All right.
2599065	2602167	Loki, I know you've got a story about Halo 3.
2603087	2609952	Yes, Halo 3, there's been some rumors coming out of the Bungie employee area there.
2610732	2615815	They basically said it's going to be more darker and grittier than the previous games.
2616295	2624881	They want to actually have an online cooperative part of the game, which would be fighting bots, which is really interesting, and that's part of the storyline.
2625101	2625261	Hmm.
2625972	2630515	A lot more cinematics Multiplayer mode with up to 50 players online
2647813	2651115	Delta Force Live, Blackhawk Down, up to 50 players online.
2651155	2662661	I've seen some on PC that are like 100, so that's not too big a deal, but I'm not surprised that they're going up to 50 players because the big team battle games that are the 60 player are really popular, so I'm not surprised.
2662681	2664062	This was a bit interesting.
2664602	2668044	They're attempting to implement both a map editor and a movie maker.
2668324	2670205	Suns Red vs. Blue.
2670825	2671866	Wow.
2672146	2675468	That reeks of fan...
2676707	2678698	I hope it's true.
2678718	2679502	That would be pretty funny.
2679522	2679925	You never know.
2681038	2683499	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2707290	2708771	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2725799	2729521	I'm going to go ahead and do another story here about Midway and some of the games that they have coming up here.
2730921	2733483	You remember they were partnering up with MTV Games?
2733903	2740626	Well, they really haven't said anything new on this, just the LA Rush partnership, but they are saying that a second game will hit in early 2006.
2741347	2746929	Also, what I thought was interesting is they are actually creating a game based on the show from Adult Swim, Aqua Teen Hunger Force.
2747029	2747590	Oh, God.
2747770	2749130	And that will be coming out in early 2006 as well.
2749150	2749711	That's going to be nuts.
2751151	2756513	Mortal Kombat will be coming out on the PSP called Mortal Kombat Deception Unchained.
2756833	2758874	It's supposed to ship in the first half of 2006.
2759514	2769237	It'll have some new characters and content, including some of what was seen on the GameCube version of Deception, like Goro, Shao Kahn actually being playable characters.
2769798	2771538	Also, Wi-Fi support.
2772038	2773259	More information to come soon.
2773859	2775800	And also, Spy Hunter...
2777677	2781579	They are working on something, but they won't say a whole lot.
2782540	2783920	Oh, I guess I should also say this one.
2784441	2786041	Unreal Tournament 2007.
2787142	2798408	Very early look given at E3, but the next entry in the shooter franchise, they are working very hard to make it a game with as long a shelf life as its predecessors.
2798888	2801530	Not a whole lot of information on Unreal Tournament outside of that.
2802670	2804891	I still need a couple, of course, on PSP.
2805512	2805932	Still waiting.
2806826	2807186	Have fun.
2836055	2839097	Just a matter of time before that poor guy gets a cease and desist, by the way.
2841359	2843401	And we'll have that follow up in a future podcast.
2845147	2848990	PlayStation 3, as you guys may or may not know, they're going to go Blu-ray.
2849791	2854855	What's interesting is that they are really kind of enforcing that it's not going to be easy to copy.
2854895	2869786	I mean, of course, not only Blu-ray piracy is going to be years off as it is, but Sony is working with the Blu-ray Disc Association to prepare the most comprehensive content management system ever employed on an optical disc format.
2870206	2877788	Hmm, supposedly it's going to happen through a system called Blu-ray's Advanced Access Content System, and also a ROM mark.
2878228	2883090	And this is made to guard against mass production piracy or duplication and unauthorized copies.
2883530	2885530	Hmm, Loki, what do you think?
2885590	2886151	Will it work?
2887131	2894313	Yeah, you know, I remember another story saying that the UMDs would never be cracked and could not be copied because they could not be read by a PC.
2895830	2897171	Oh, no wait, they're wrong there.
2897831	2898371	Let me put it this way.
2898391	2900492	If it can be read by something, it can be copied.
2901113	2902393	That's the bottom line.
2902734	2904835	It will be done no matter what the hell they do.
2905895	2906815	It will not work.
2907576	2914219	And basically, this is really just going to prevent people until you can copy a full Blu-ray just like you can copy a DVD.
2914259	2916500	Yeah, it's going to be harder, but it can be done.
2916520	2919802	They said the same thing about the GigaDisc, but you can actually buy GD-ROMs.
2921943	2923503	Well, that's that.
2923824	2924744	And lastly tonight,
2925431	2946910	GamePro Magazine teamed up with Mad Magazine to present the 10 worst things about video games and you can check out a preview of the 10 actually I'm sorry the article is about the 50 worst things the article online is the 10 and you can check it out over on GamePro.com they have this just a couple of these points see if you guys here in studio agree with them one
2947509	2961955	Game designers who cannot understand why more women don't play video games, especially since they feature such outstanding female role models as a globetrotting archaeologist with big boobs, world-class volleyball champions with big boobs, and, of course, easily murdered hookers with big boobs.
2962435	2965316	And then, of course, they have the picture as drawn by Mad Magazine to go with that.
2966317	2967637	Ho, ho, and ho.
2968177	2973720	Console manufacturers selling systems without basic essentials like memory cards or a second controller.
2973740	2977121	So you have to shell out another $60 before you can...
2977847	2979729	See so much as a hair on Luigi's mustache
2998408	3000629	Oh, this will make Jamie upset, so I have to read this one.
3000969	3013813	Sega's long, pathetic parade of short-lived console systems, from the Sega CD to the 32X to the Saturn to the Dreamcast, establishing a legacy of failure on its way to rivaling that of the Chicago Cubs.
3015254	3019035	You know, the systems only failed because people didn't appreciate them.
3020056	3023757	And Sega, I have to say, had really stupid marketing.
3024357	3027138	They had good systems, good solid systems.
3027888	3029449	But they weren't given the support that they needed.
3030510	3031651	You know, the Saturn.
3032131	3033672	The Saturn in Japan?
3034893	3036014	Brilliant system.
3036274	3042919	I mean, just had so many great games, would regularly hold its own neck and neck with the PlayStation.
3043480	3045461	But over here, did we get a lot of the cool crap?
3045942	3046122	No.
3046782	3049224	The last good game we got was Burning Rangers.
3049905	3052887	And it was actually, if I'm correct, the last game that was on the Saturn over here.
3054008	3056930	Which I, luckily enough, now have a US copy of.
3057538	3059600	Thanks to Classic Gaming Expo.
3059640	3061502	Still love Mad Magazine after that little tidbit.
