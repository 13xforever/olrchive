1169	3891	Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of August 22nd, 2005.
3992	15722	You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.
15962	19425	Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
20905	22786	Hello, everybody.
22947	32474	Welcome once again to another edition of Orange Lounge Radio To Go, that podcast dedicated to video games that don't suck.
32834	33795	My name is Rob Roberts.
33835	35136	You might know me as Sky.
35536	47064	Joining us via Skype tonight, and I know that we say we usually don't do the co-host over Skype, but, you know, we can't help cases of sickness or injury, and that's what the one and only DarkSakura is facing tonight.
47104	49146	Hello, DarkSakura on the Skype tonight.
50109	51911	Yo, what's going on?
51951	52591	What happened?
52611	53212	Are you okay?
54193	69746	Well, I was covering Classic Gaming Expo for us today, and I guess it was a combination of walking around and the driving and then just sitting still practically with my leg extended, but my hip flared up really bad, so I'm sort of hyped up on Vicodin tonight.
70146	73068	Alright, so we can't have her driving over to the studio when she's on Vicodin.
73709	76171	But you've got to tell us a little bit about Classic Gaming Expo tonight.
77715	79496	It was about the same as it was last year.
79556	81716	They had more games that actually worked.
83477	85318	Had my picture taken by a millipede.
85358	87398	That'll be somewhere on our site eventually.
89259	93620	Got to meet some pretty cool people, including the guys who do retro gaming radio.
93800	94341	They're pretty cool.
95681	100162	And got to just see all kinds of stuff.
100182	101563	I bought Famicom games today.
102223	102803	Oh, very cool.
102843	104684	Like the original Japanese Nintendo games.
105774	107075	I bought Final Fantasy 2.
108135	108515	Cool.
109395	111736	And I got Final Fantasy 5 for Super Famicom.
111756	113917	I got Mappyland for Famicom.
113937	116558	I got some PC Engine hue cards.
116618	119339	We actually got a PC Engine core graphics today.
120440	124261	And just some other little bits and pieces that I'll have pictures of shortly.
124721	125481	Alright, sounds good.
125742	129623	How did you think this year's Classic Gaming Expo compared to previous years that you've been to?
130863	131944	It was really...
133075	133716	It was empty.
133756	146649	Then again, we did go on second day toward the end, but there was just an emptiness I felt to it, which is probably a good idea they're taking next year off because I'm hoping the one in 2007 is going to be fantastic.
146709	148931	It's supposed to be their anniversary.
150332	150673	Oh, very cool.
150693	151814	Their, I think, 10th anniversary.
151994	152414	Very cool.
152434	155858	So I'm hoping it's big and maybe, you know,
156286	158526	Maybe if it works out, we can get in on that.
158646	161167	Yeah, I definitely want to check it out when it comes back.
161187	163227	And they always have a really good show at E3 as well.
163267	165228	I like the concept of Classic Gaming Expo.
165888	170008	Hopefully a year off, we'll just recharge them a little bit and they'll be good to go in 2007.
170509	171809	So I'm looking forward to that, definitely.
172729	173969	Well, 8-Bit Weapon was back.
174289	174809	Oh, how were they?
176730	178550	They were awesome as always.
178730	183571	And another guy was there as part of the convention playing music on a keyboard.
183671	184231	Pretty cool stuff.
184560	184760	Not really.
184820	187342	Actually, there were people who were doing new prototypes.
187362	187502	Uh-huh.
211038	214081	But nothing, you know, there was the Intellivision people were there again.
214321	214561	Right.
215342	227093	There was a guy, he said it's actually someone in Brazil makes these, but they take the MSX games, like the Metal Gear and the original Metal Gear 2 were on MSX, as was the Guardian Legend, it was called Guardia.
227413	228014	Oh, cool.
228054	232278	They were all MSX games, and they have them remade to play on the ColecoVision.
233299	234200	Oh, wow.
235071	240094	That was neat, but there wasn't anything really new there.
240254	242796	Nothing like what Gradius V was last year.
244037	250601	Alright, well, we'll look forward to more reports on Classic Gaming Expo on our website, www.orangeloungeradio.com.
250661	255244	DarkSakura's picture collection will be posted sometime during the week, so we look forward to that.
255744	261628	Now, I haven't forgotten, four minutes into the show, but I haven't forgotten the one and only TechMassaLoki over there in studio tonight.
261908	262969	I wasn't even like
263541	263761	DarkSakura
276623	278465	So let DarkSakura do a little report there.
278485	281287	Why don't you give us one of your stories you're looking at tonight from the hack and crack scene.
282107	285690	Well, my report, I was just kind of browsing stuff.
285970	289733	One of them is a mod for Half-Life 2 called Half-Life 2 Fueled.
290413	300280	And because Half-Life 2 is famous for its ragdoll physics and playing with the ragdoll physics, they have some really kick-ass shots from this.
300680	305884	Just like, you know, for example, tons of cars just all strewn about the place and
307259	308940	It looks like it's going to be pretty cool.
309220	311701	They've got some ramps in this little demo thing here.
311721	319263	You can find out more about it on www.fueledmod.com And they've got some interesting stuff on there.
319543	321484	So, yeah, cool.
322184	330407	Alright, well now what I want to do is I want to go ahead and start off tonight's show, even though we had a couple stories there, to start off tonight's show talking about what we like to always start off the show talking about.
330727	333268	What games have we, the hosts, been playing this week?
333828	335789	DarkSakura, what have you been playing this week in your gaming world?
337506	352790	well seeing as how I started school this week I haven't had a whole bunch of time and I actually am going to be signing back up for Ragnarok Online again it's funny you should talk about signing up for old MMOs you're not signing back up for Final Fantasy XI are you?
353931	366094	I wouldn't say I'm not going to I'm going to give Ragnarok a try for a month to see if I really miss it as badly as I think I do
366696	368737	That's my philosophy on Final Fantasy as well.
369697	374200	But they have like a pay $7 for 30 hours of gameplay, so I'm going to give that a go.
374660	375520	Okay, sounds good.
375580	377201	Just for a month.
377441	384845	I hunted down the Vetrex, and then I remembered why I don't play the Vetrex, because it kind of gave me a headache.
385085	387086	But the Vetrex was just a cool idea, really.
388586	390187	Well, true.
390987	391428	I also...
393584	396645	I tried out a couple of Hu cards at Classic Gaming Expo today.
398625	401486	Actually, I also watched Dan try out some of the ones that we bought.
401526	402587	We got Sun Sun 2.
402667	403567	That game is cool.
404287	405807	Wow, I don't even think I've heard of that.
405907	410489	Oh, yeah, okay, I have heard of that, but that's a, wow, that's an obscure game.
411429	412469	Yeah, pretty obscure.
412989	414610	A lot of stuff at Classic Gaming Expo is obscure.
415077	418300	Legend of the Valkyrie Loki, what games have you been playing this week?
418320	421624	I've been playing pretty much the same stuff I was playing last week.
421644	421824	I played
438578	440399	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
465995	468496	So, Taiko Drum Master here in the US, of course.
469016	470917	That's got to be weird on the PSP, though.
471417	472357	It works really good, actually.
472377	481040	I kind of looked over your shoulder while you were playing it, and it looks really crisp, and it's just like the PlayStation 2 version right on your little PSP.
481080	483381	Yeah, it's really good, and it's pretty fun.
483481	489002	I just wish it was in English, so I'd be able to understand what menus were and stuff, because it's a pain in the ass.
489423	494124	But someone did make some on GameFAQs, I think, English translations of the menus, so
494656	495156	That helps.
495376	495976	That's always helpful.
496136	496297	Yeah.
496477	498257	Those game fact people are always very helpful.
498377	500138	It is, but you know what they could help me out with?
500238	505520	Some cheats from freaking Burnout 3, because I've got to play through these races, and I'm not liking that.
505560	507320	I need my fast cars now.
507720	508961	All right.
510001	512142	My gaming week... Is that all you've had?
512322	513002	Yeah, that's all I have.
513042	513242	All right.
513622	518024	My gaming week has consisted of my... Well, I was sick this week, actually.
518064	518984	Jamie has...
519525	520046	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
538107	541889	I've had a Japanese one for years to get my music gaming fix out of the way.
542790	546412	But since I was living with Loki for such a long time, he had an American PlayStation 2.
547712	551494	I didn't have a need for my own, so I finally went and bought one on Saturday.
551594	554256	I bought one of the little chibi miniature ones.
554516	560639	I really hadn't seen one because everybody else I know got their PlayStation 2s years ago, so they're huge.
560899	563061	So I hadn't really seen the tiny ones up close.
563701	565582	Damn, those are tiny PlayStations!
566220	571644	I could have just loaned you mine indefinitely since I have Final Fantasy X International And you're playing it half the hassle
594953	596033	Sorry, my headset moved back.
596053	596533	Oh, that's all right.
596553	597694	Knowing it's half the hassle.
599614	599894	All right.
600594	609436	Anyway, also, I bought the PlayStation 2 so that I could, you know, screen new games if we start getting any screeners.
610196	612796	I should say additional screeners from, like, you know, media companies and stuff.
612916	613956	I do have demos at work.
613996	614796	I haven't brought them in though.
614916	616177	Yeah, so we'll start taking a look at those.
616637	621658	And as well as, you know, just renting some games and checking things out so I can keep a tab on what's going on.
622098	623398	Also, other than the PlayStation 2, as...
624431	625251	People are cultists.
625271	625571	I escaped.
625611	626192	I escaped.
651912	657634	You sure did, but you're in Ragnarok, which is, you know, some people would say just as bad.
658315	662936	Hey, I've been in Ragnarok for like, what, five years, six years?
663156	665077	Yeah, well, you're still getting quiet there.
665097	666678	My addiction is stronger than your addiction.
666698	668559	You're a little quiet there, DarkSakura.
668899	670880	My addiction is stronger than your addiction.
672280	674561	My addiction is mighty, and to be feared.
675953	677896	Zelda Twilight Princess got the big ol' delay to Spring 2006
689181	718256	and of course the question heard around the world what the hell Nintendo what the hell you had this game ready to show us at E3 and we thought you were all ready to go in the fall but now they're saying no we need more time we're announcing a new global launch in 2006 after the conclusion of the fiscal year so no earlier than April 1st we'll provide a specific date at a later point in time while this may come as a disappointment it will absolutely enrich the game and make it a multi-million seller
719163	719804	I don't know about that.
719864	721005	It would have been that anyways.
721925	722306	I know.
722706	723767	Yeah, that means Rob.
724067	724287	What?
725008	726229	Birthday present for me.
727410	729611	Yeah, hopefully it's released around your birthday.
729691	735516	But the reason why they say they're doing this is because they're adding extra things to it.
736016	736397	Who knows?
736437	737597	The game could be buggy as hell.
737638	739579	Who really knows why this game got pushed back?
739619	742681	But what they're saying is that they're trying to add new things to it.
743122	745804	Which I suppose is good news, but at the same time...
746860	749922	It's not like there's been a flood of GameCube games lately.
749962	752983	They really should have been working on this double time a while ago.
753864	757606	What we've got is a bunch of game testers going, but I haven't beaten it yet!
757726	758406	Delay!
760367	760847	Maybe.
760927	763589	That would be a good news thing, though, because that means the game is long.
764349	766770	Hopefully, it'll be a good thing, but I don't know.
766870	769752	Does it affect your feelings about the game at all, this delay?
773304	782530	for me, I will probably still pick it up but I'm not I feel like by the time it comes out I will feel like, oh, this is yesterday's game
783362	783902	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
808223	811707	yes, a game is only as good as how it plays
822580	824661	Another delay that pisses the hell out of me.
825181	830623	Final Fantasy Advent Children is not coming out until the end of November, November 30th.
831083	837946	Not many places have actually, no one's really said anything about this delay, but I have the inside info, being that I work for a video distributor.
838966	841307	So, that's straight from Sony, folks.
842948	844889	Gotta hate it.
845049	851271	I hope I'm wrong, and I hope that data is just pulled out of thin air and Sony doesn't know what they're talking about, but
852162	852823	I'm afraid it's true.
872819	890358	and some in Europe so probably not a whole lot of Japanese listeners we've got but if you are listening to us and you're interested in going you need to be registered with the Shinra Company online fan club and I'm guessing if you're not already signed up you might have lost out because I don't think they're accepting new club members anymore so um
891119	894362	They will randomly select people if they get too many people that want to get in.
895222	900547	It's going to be happening September 10th through the 16th in Tokyo.
901648	908373	Nagoya and Kyoto will be the three cities that will be showing Final Fantasy Advent Children on the big screen.
909254	911976	Otherwise, you're going to have to wait for the UMD and DVD formats.
913444	914524	Here in America as well.
915645	920986	One other story, I know the big news this week, the game we're all excited about is Nintendogs is coming out this week.
921086	922187	I'm very excited about this.
923727	928348	Here's the interesting thing about Nintendogs, they're actually going to be getting a special holiday edition.
928448	936871	Well, okay, it's kind of a rumor right now, but Nintendo of America did file some papers with the ESRB that indicate something called
937331	939853	Nintendogs Holiday Edition.
940394	946899	And we all know how Nintendo loves to get you to buy the same crap in new packaging over and over again.
946959	950682	So this really wouldn't be a surprise if this is something they are actually doing.
951042	952483	Nintendogs Holiday Edition.
952803	953384	What do you think?
955806	958988	Are they being premature with this though since the game hasn't even come out here?
959048	960609	It could be a massive failure here.
960729	961390	I doubt it will be.
961650	962270	But it could be.
962451	964532	No, it's not going to be a failure.
964933	966794	And it's coming out right after my wedding, you know.
968319	968839	Is that a hint?
969360	970640	You're already going to get it.
971161	972422	We don't have to buy it for your wedding.
972462	973302	You're already going to have it.
973602	974003	Of course.
974403	983068	No, I think, honestly, I see the game being a big success because if there's one thing Nintendo understands, it's a formula.
984509	986971	You know, we have Pokemon as our big example.
987791	992754	They know what's going to appeal, and there's already been so much hype from the Japanese version.
992895	994956	It's already so widely popular.
996616	997797	I don't see any way for
1011944	1014446	The Game Boy Micro is going to be coming out here for $99.99.
1015267	1023495	Now the Game Boy Micro, for those of you that were sleeping during E3 coverage, it's like the Game Boy Advance, but really freaking tiny.
1023795	1024996	Like palm of your hand tiny.
1025056	1027578	It's a little bit bigger than the Game Boy Advance cartridges.
1027839	1032363	If you go look on our E3 pictures, they have a pretty close up image.
1033331	1033651	They do.
1034411	1035972	We do have that in the gallery.
1036132	1038012	Four inches wide, this thing is.
1038292	1040393	It's tiny.
1040413	1040393	$99.99.
1040453	1044514	It'll be coming out September 19th is the day this is coming out.
1044894	1046055	Also, faceplates.
1046235	1048515	The faceplate changing is a big thing they're doing with this.
1048555	1052016	So you can have a Game Boy Micro that matches your purse or something.
1052036	1052337	I don't know.
1052757	1056158	Flame, camouflage, or just simple silver.
1056978	1057098	So...
1057645	1058946	And also, yeah, they come with...
1074133	1077655	The Silver or Black Faceplate, depending on whether yours is silver or black.
1077795	1078976	Okay.
1079497	1083439	Japanese release will be September 13th, and it'll be coming out for 12,000 yen.
1083719	1086721	That's about $109, so it's a little more expensive in Japan.
1087041	1097968	But get this, for our European friends, we're paying $99, they're paying 99 euro, and the euro's worth a little more, so that's $121 US.
1098068	1098609	November 4th.
1098629	1099830	But they get pink.
1099870	1100390	It's too bad.
1100650	1101471	Yes, but they get pink.
1102551	1103372	Not that, you know...
1104301	1104701	Yeah, I know.
1105742	1106062	All right.
1106442	1110765	We're going to take a minute to open up the old mailbag here at Orange Lounge Radio.
1110785	1115487	Remember, you guys can send in your questions for Orange Lounge Radio at our address.
1115547	1120690	It's togo, T-O-G-O, at orangeloungeradio.com.
1121731	1123011	So we have a couple of letters this week.
1123051	1127494	The first letter I'd like to read comes from SithSpawn is the name of the
1127981	1129422	I don't have any kids and I don't ever want them.
1129442	1131283	However, I do have a few words concerning video game violence and ratings.
1131303	1135706	The main problem originates with the many groups pushing for stricter ratings and or the banning of certain games.
1151397	1151857	Thank you for watching!
1172425	1176367	Brian from Michigan is suggesting there are two simple steps to deal with this problem.
1176728	1177528	Know your games.
1178048	1181350	As a parent, you need to know about the ratings and actually play these games.
1181810	1184412	Also, take the ratings with a grain of salt.
1184732	1188474	The opinions of the ESRB aren't necessarily your own.
1188854	1189915	Instruct your child.
1190255	1196799	The only way to prevent your kid from playing the games you do not want them to play is to ensure that they do not want to play them.
1197179	1199380	It's exactly the same as saying no to drugs.
1199741	1204686	It's all about the child making decisions based on input from the parents.
1205027	1209271	Give your kid the tools he or she needs to make educated decisions when you are not around.
1209972	1210753	Very interesting.
1210813	1213396	I like his steps there that he offers there.
1213436	1216739	A very educated response from our friend SithSpawn.
1217700	1219082	I was very impressed with that letter.
1219302	1219943	Yes, it was very nice.
1221174	1222275	We also have another letter here.
1222375	1225118	This letter is from another Jamie.
1225218	1227680	It actually could be Jaime, but we think it's Jamie.
1228801	1232323	Jamie's been listening to the show for two months now and says it's really interesting.
1232764	1233024	Thank you.
1233284	1236507	There's a reason you guys won the podcast award, partially because of my vote.
1236547	1237087	Thank you again.
1237548	1237868	Very kind.
1238428	1242672	I know exactly what you mean about the misspelling of your name in talking to our own Jamie here.
1242992	1245354	I have the exact same problem, but in reverse.
1245434	1247596	This person spells their name J-A-I-M-E.
1248991	1249792	So very interesting.
1250854	1254239	We were talking about Evercrack's economy.
1254339	1262112	Well, Jamie actually sent us a link to an article about the economy, and it's a really good link to a story that has more information on the economy.
1262877	1279642	http://mu.ranter.net theory economy.html And actually what this is, this is kind of like an opinion piece about the economy inside video games.
1279722	1281022	It's a really well-written piece.
1281282	1282662	So if you guys have some time, check that out.
1282702	1283383	That's very cool.
1284343	1291465	Also, Jamie wanted to point out a website called stopstopkill.com Jamie, did you have a chance to check out stopstopkill.com?
1293314	1294714	Actually, this is one I knew about.
1294754	1300876	At the time, it was more of a placeholder, but it actually looks like it's gone full active.
1300996	1303877	It's about the truth about violence in video games.
1304557	1307558	Someone else, you know, trying to get the word out there.
1308198	1317140	Basically, any type of research that's being done in regards to video games, they're putting this up on their site.
1317420	1319621	And then, you know, also putting out...
1320285	1326451	Trying to give the whole broad spectrum, but also trying to say, hey, this is where you are wrong.
1328933	1330895	It's a pretty awesome site so far.
1330955	1332116	I'm pretty impressed with it.
1332236	1336560	Also, there's a forum on here that says Gamers Against Jack Forum.
1336581	1337742	Interesting.
1337782	1338883	It's about Jack Thompson.
1339683	1343587	Also, it links back to Jack Thompson's site, StopKill.com.
1345008	1345469	Interesting.
1346059	1350361	which is basically more of Jack Thompson talking out of his ass.
1352342	1353002	Well, it's true.
1353042	1358304	The man, I hate to say, well, I don't really hate to say it, but he's a freaking idiot.
1359364	1361485	Jack Thompson, if you're listening, you're a moron.
1362325	1362886	Thank you for that.
1362906	1363626	He'll appreciate that.
1369310	1369650	All right.
1369911	1370291	Anyway.
1370511	1371332	Anyway, moving on.
1372332	1373193	Yeah, moving forward.
1373433	1376735	But this site is pretty cool, and we need more stuff like this.
1376835	1395949	I'm actually going to, as soon as I get an opportunity to send this guy a link to that article I found on Game Revolution with the information provided from the FBI and Department of Justice showing the crime rate in youth going down since the release of the PS1.
1395989	1397270	I think that he might benefit from that.
1397690	1397890	All right.
1399200	1403621	Now, it's funny that we got an email from somebody named Jamie because we also got an email from somebody named Rob.
1405101	1410402	And I'm actually going to start with Rob's PS because he said kind of a nice thing here and I just want to repeat it.
1411302	1415943	Rob said something about sorry for delaying a podcast and listeners inquiring what went on.
1416303	1418624	I appreciate your contribution to the video game media.
1418704	1421544	Since it's free, I don't think I have any right to demand it.
1421604	1422825	People should be more gracious.
1422965	1424465	Well, that's really nice, Rob.
1424505	1425185	We try our best.
1425592	1425872	DarkSakura.com
1446451	1447211	We do, it's awesome.
1448472	1455796	Also, he actually had a response to an article about virtual ethics, which I thought was very interesting.
1456797	1463420	DarkSakura, did you have any reports on ethics going on, like the mugging that's going on in games or anything?
1464241	1475907	Well, just to give sort of a bit of a paraphrasing from this one article that he linked me to, a man was arrested in Japan on suspicion of carrying out a virtual mugging spree by using software bots to beat up
1476277	1478438	and robbed characters in the online game Lineage 2.
1478518	1479858	I got to try that at E3 a couple years ago.
1480058	1481439	That's what you do in that game.
1481459	1485140	The stolen possessions, the virtual items, were exchanged for cash.
1486721	1490942	It was a Chinese exchange student that was arrested for this in Kagawa.
1491162	1492242	Hmm.
1493403	1497424	Several players had their characters beaten and robbed of valuable virtual objects.
1498865	1502206	It names items called Earring of Wisdom and Shield of Nightmare.
1502226	1504807	I guess they're pretty big things in Lineage.
1505147	1505267	Hmm.
1506119	1510604	But the items were fenced off through a Japanese auction website, according to NCSoft.
1510844	1512065	That's the company that makes Lineage 2.
1513006	1515028	And he did it by using a software bot.
1515709	1516470	So it couldn't be beat.
1517665	1518185	Interesting.
1518285	1519486	So there's always a way around this.
1519506	1521087	Well, I want to read Rob's response to this.
1522087	1527049	If you feel your character and stuff are worth paying blackmail, you seriously need a real life.
1527450	1527830	Who knows?
1527930	1535754	Maybe the virtual mugging sent the victim home from the internet cafe early to inadvertently save the lives of himself and or his neglected offspring.
1536074	1538235	Blackmail in real life is a serious crime.
1538295	1540656	Virtual ethics had nothing to do with the perp's arrest.
1541089	1542229	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1570829	1574372	In regards to the virtual ethics thing, sad.
1576173	1577714	Sad.
1577814	1579075	I weep for society.
1579696	1583718	Actually, I did have another email that was linked to me.
1585960	1586681	I'll just go ahead.
1586701	1588782	It was an article that was within it.
1588842	1592605	Unfortunately, I couldn't find the original one, but it's a little brief one.
1593526	1596768	Going back to the game addiction business.
1597871	1597991	Hmm.
1598231	1598291	Hmm.
1623137	1628233	He was moved to a hospital but died a few hours later due to what the doctors are presuming was a heart attack.
1628965	1630766	I swear I've heard this story before.
1631107	1639933	Like, maybe not this exact same person, but I swear I've heard this exact same setup, internet cafe, person there playing their game too damn much, and dying from it.
1639993	1641133	I swear I've heard this before.
1641153	1642174	That happened a couple weeks ago.
1642234	1644636	Somebody didn't get the hint the last time, apparently.
1645296	1650320	Well, actually, when I got the link on this, it was earlier within the week, and the time says five hours ago.
1650660	1651080	Interesting.
1651140	1652241	So it was fairly recent.
1652261	1656524	They also said that he'd been fired from his job because he kept missing work to play computer games.
1657142	1657522	Wow.
1657802	1659923	So that's like instead of drinking, he gamed.
1661204	1674629	Yeah, and you know, if you look at it this way, for the people who are those, you know, hardcore addicts to booze, they're trying to escape from something that's gone wrong in their life.
1675989	1681551	These people are using, you know, games in return to escape from the, you know, the bad that's gone on in their life.
1681852	1682852	Which sort of goes back to...
1683815	1687538	How would an internet cafe allow you to be there for 48 hours straight?
1687578	1691982	I mean, I know there's 24-hour cafes and everything, but isn't that unethical business?
1692542	1698106	I realize we're talking about another country, but... Well, I know they're making money, but at some point, don't you have to draw the line?
1698347	1699828	You've got to sleep at some point.
1699888	1700208	Hold on.
1700688	1708354	When you go to a bar and the bartender sees that you've had one too many drinks, the bartender has a... I don't know if it's legal.
1708374	1709195	I'm almost positive it is.
1709495	1710116	But they have an...
1710456	1713118	I don't care where in the world you are, why didn't somebody stop this guy?
1734793	1737036	This man was ultimately responsible for himself.
1737437	1744626	By all rights, it's not their place to tell him how to live his life, basically.
1745267	1746508	He was a paying customer.
1746568	1749132	If he chooses to pay with his life for that...
1749790	1754193	It really isn't their... I mean, this may sound cold, but it really isn't their concern.
1754433	1755214	I understand that point.
1755794	1767562	It is ultimately his fault, but why didn't anybody, his friend, a loved one who noticed he was missing for 48 hours, a worker at the place who must have seen this going on, nobody intervened?
1768083	1770244	And that's, like, not good Samaritan.
1770524	1771845	I know.
1772025	1774967	Nobody should let anybody play StarCraft for that long anyway.
1774987	1777189	I saw that coming.
1777209	1778249	That's exactly what my point is.
1778510	1778750	I do.
1778770	1778970	Eventually,
1781192	1781712	DarkSakura.com
1810899	1812460	You seriously gotta question your priorities.
1812860	1813361	Seriously.
1813701	1827851	I mean, once in a great while, it might be okay because, you know, you're not feeling up to it or whatever, but if you notice yourself, you're doing it repeatedly over and over again, you're not going out and having a real life because you're staying in and playing video games of any nature, really, not just MMOs.
1829032	1830333	You gotta get outdoors once in a while.
1830393	1835377	That's why we do our advice column, which I guess is a good segue into that portion of the show, right?
1836458	1838820	Actually, Rob, you know I did that once when I was in high school.
1839080	1839340	Really?
1839360	1839440	Yeah.
1840131	1844492	I stayed out of school for a week to play Final Fantasy 3, which was 6.
1845052	1847213	But you didn't do that all the time, right?
1847973	1851294	No, and I actually did legitimately develop the flu within that week.
1851614	1852054	Oh, okay.
1852094	1855455	Well, see, it's still a little extreme.
1855575	1858215	I still might kind of raise my eyebrow at that and go, Jamie.
1858515	1861656	But this is to the point that I was in high school.
1862116	1863397	I'm an adult now.
1863677	1864877	That man was an adult.
1865191	1866252	There was no excuse.
1866272	1866752	Oh, hell no.
1866772	1869975	I just bounce uncontrollably at work until I get to go home and play it.
1869995	1870435	No time to live!
1891553	1894115	So DarkSakura is here to give us her advice column.
1894155	1896976	DarkSakura, what is your advice about tonight?
1899058	1904281	Today's bit of advice is how to survive if you are in the line of fire, if you are the primary target.
1905682	1909644	You know, that means like everyone else is wearing camo, you're wearing white.
1910765	1914867	Number one, get as far away as possible, a.k.a.
1914927	1915527	run like hell.
1916228	1920951	An untrained shooter is not likely to be accurate at any distance greater than 60 feet.
1923580	1926361	2.
1924160	1926361	Run fast, but do not move in a straight line.
1926501	1927522	Weave back and forth.
1928042	1933885	The average shooter will not have the training necessary to hit a moving target at any real distance.
1933905	1933885	3.
1934325	1935825	Turn a corner if possible.
1935885	1936686	Well, duh.
1937986	1936686	4.
1938487	1940227	Do not bother to count shots.
1940688	1943789	You will have no idea the shooter has more ammunition.
1944169	1946190	Counting is only for the movies.
1947498	1949338	My final bit of advice.
1949518	1949778	Yes.
1950839	1951299	Shoot back.
1953519	1953719	No.
1955020	1955980	It's basically this.
1956300	1957200	Run like a bitch.
1957720	1960941	I think that's my favorite final piece of advice you've ever given on this program.
1961581	1961781	Yeah.
1961801	1962361	That was nice.
1962401	1962721	Thank you.
1963401	1966162	If you're getting shot at, freaking shoot back.
1968122	1968362	Nice.
1968462	1968822	Real nice.
1969322	1970623	Taunt them as you run.
1971243	1972043	Loki, what else you got?
1972063	1972303	Perhaps they
1975819	1977900	Now go away before I taunt you a second time.
1979121	1981922	Loki, what's going on in the hack and crack scene?
1982383	1983423	There's tons of stuff.
1984224	1991367	First off, there was a nice cell shading demo that was released, kind of showing what homebrew stuff can do right now, which is kind of neat.
1992608	2001393	And then also on top of that, looks like SanDisk was announcing that they're going to be releasing their 2GB memory stick here pretty soon.
2002574	2002714	TI-MIDI
2031348	2032688	or Miditty, I guess.
2033668	2039469	It's a MIDI playing program that's on the PSP, which was kind of interesting.
2040430	2049231	There was a rhythm composer program being made, PSP Rhythm Composer, and that's kind of like a drum machine type thing, which is interesting.
2050751	2057492	Also, there was a program that was released called PSP Tune, which helps you tune your guitar.
2058333	2058593	Huh.
2059073	2060093	That's helpful.
2063190	2074834	On the DS end of things, there was also an update done to the ColecoVision emulator, which is called ColecoDS, appropriately.
2075715	2084638	And version 0.2 is released, and they've got some interesting screenshots on ndsupdates.com, so go check those out if you have some time.
2085325	2086246	OrangeLoungeRadio.com
2104113	2105014	Dance Dance Revolution Xtreme 2
2125075	2136540	including La Copa De Vida from Patrick Victorio, that's a cover of the original Ricky Martin one, Look At Us, the Daddy DJ remix by Serena Paris, and Cartoon Heroes from Barbie Young.
2136861	2148326	Even some old songs, Boom Boom Dollar, K.O.G.G.3 mix from King Kong and D-Jungle Girls, Captain Jack, a Grondale remix from Captain Jack, and Butterfly, the Upswing mix from SmileDK.
2149013	2149674	Spin, Spin, Sugar
2158919	2162601	by the Sneaker Pimps, Silence by Delirium with Sarah McLachlan.
2163541	2169444	Also, we have Block Rockin' Beats by the Chemical Brothers and As the Rush Comes from Motorcycle.
2169744	2170844	And that's just a short list.
2171705	2173285	Oh, also Get Busy by Sean Paul.
2173305	2174186	That's kind of a neat little song.
2175046	2179028	The full list, of course, is available on our website, www.orangeloungeradio.com.
2179748	2183611	Also making an announcement this week, Karaoke Revolution Party.
2184151	2187013	Whole lot of songs in Karaoke Revolution Party Edition.
2188154	2197101	My gosh, Take On Me, Material Girl, Me and Bobby McGee, Flame, Do You Really Want to Hurt Me, Call Me, American Woman.
2197241	2198782	I could read this list all day.
2198902	2199403	It's huge.
2199683	2201204	Check it out, orangelaunchradio.com.
2201224	2205207	That's going to be Karaoke Revolution Party Edition coming out a little later this year.
2206704	2211586	Konami's also announcing Suikoden Tactics, which is going to be coming out for the PlayStation 2.
2212587	2217989	Of course, you could think of this as kind of like Final Fantasy Tactics, but Suikoden Tactics!
2218849	2222231	The official announcement came out this week that it will be coming out for the PlayStation 2.
2223191	2226533	We're looking at a spring 2006 release date for this game.
2228618	2229079	Advent Rising
2241542	2253453	Due to too many bugs going on with the game, or basically I was going to say too many bugs, too many things going wrong in the system, they have quietly canceled the million dollar giveaway.
2253493	2254674	That happened earlier this week.
2255075	2265204	Instead, as kind of a consolation prize, each person who participated in the Race to Save Humanity contest will receive two free games from its recent catalog.
2265284	2266205	Not too bad.
2266778	2276462	of a consolation prize when you consider that the games you can choose from, BloodRayne 2, Guilty Gear X2 Reload, Psychonauts, Rays as Hell, and Phantom Dust.
2276482	2278863	So there's quite a few good games in that catalog there.
2279463	2286286	Too bad though about that million dollar competition because they stand to be paying that much out in all these free games.
2286366	2286706	I don't know.
2286766	2288287	I don't know how many people were in this contest.
2288367	2293989	This really wasn't a game that appealed to me personally, but I just think it's interesting that the contest had to be called off.
2294029	2296450	It was a cool game, but it did have its fair share of bugs.
2296724	2297485	Yeah, it's too bad.
2298526	2298806	Alright.
2300328	2310460	Also, I want to point this out, World of Warcraft, you know this, the MMO, the most popular MMO which none of us play here on this program.
2312548	2315351	I actually have a friend that's really trying to get me into it, too.
2315411	2320355	I've tried to install it, and my computer won't accept the installation for some reason, which makes no sense to me.
2320375	2321515	It's like, no!
2321575	2322556	No, I don't want this.
2322596	2324818	You already put enough crappy MMOs on me.
2325679	2327180	So I'm trying to make it work.
2327260	2331623	So we will soon be reporting from inside World of Warcraft at some point, hopefully.
2332324	2336047	But we did want to point out Upper Deck Entertainment.
2336487	2337808	What is Upper Deck well known for?
2338629	2339069	Cards.
2339089	2340090	Cards, that's right.
2340130	2341011	They are making a...
2341769	2346073	They are making a trading card game based out of World of Warcraft.
2346694	2359466	The quote from Jerry Benton, Senior Vice President of Upper Deck Entertainment, The World of Warcraft trading card game will perfectly capture all of the action-packed combat and furious competition that online players have come to expect.
2359646	2361928	Will there be a slash... Oh wait, no, that's EverQuest 2.
2361968	2362869	Slash pizza card, that'd be sweet.
2366826	2366926	XBOX 360
2388320	2390942	Very interesting.
2391703	2393464	$299.99 US for the basic unit.
2393545	2397108	I don't know why they just don't say $300, because that's what you're going to be paying after tax.
2397328	2397108	$300.
2398168	2406936	So for $300, you're going to get the Xbox 360 console, the controller, which is a wired controller, but it has an extended 9-foot cable.
2407476	2410437	I didn't understand anyways because there's no freaking controller ports on there.
2410477	2411917	So where are you playing it?
2412478	2413198	Now a new game.
2413298	2414238	Find the controller port.
2414378	2415458	A USB port maybe?
2416119	2416619	Whatever.
2416739	2417039	Maybe?
2417299	2417719	Gotcha.
2417939	2418239	All right.
2418659	2424561	An Xbox 360 faceplate and an Xbox 360 standard AV cable.
2425021	2425281	All right.
2425341	2425941	Composite.
2426502	2427582	So that's the first one.
2428908	2429248	XBOX 360 CORE
2444607	2449150	400 bucks, console, hard drive, 20 gigabytes.
2449511	2455615	Yes, ladies and gentlemen, the Xbox 360 will not have a hard drive built in by default like the original Xbox did.
2455695	2456275	You know what I'm doing?
2456295	2456435	What?
2456455	2460058	I'm going to take that freaking hard drive and rip it apart and put a 120 gig hard drive in there.
2460158	2461899	Screw that 20 gig crap.
2461919	2472226	For the $400, you get the wireless controller, the faceplate, a headset, a component high-definition cable, so you... Well, let me... I'll get to that thought.
2472606	2473467	Xbox Live...
2476023	2480086	Xbox Live Silver Membership Bonus Media Remote
2502910	2509013	is kind of trying to soften the blow of the fact that the system really costs $400 for everything you want.
2509053	2513736	Yeah, I'm thinking what people are going to do is be buying that when the third-party stuff starts coming out.
2513756	2514596	Possibly.
2514656	2516638	Because you don't have to buy a hard drive.
2516658	2523261	You can buy this stupid little 64-meg memory card thing, and you don't have to buy a wireless controller.
2523281	2524422	I mean, it's just nice.
2524782	2526683	And you don't have to have a headset and
2527307	2527948	And guess what?
2528168	2530152	The Xbox Live Silver package, that's free.
2530813	2535239	So that's not really a big... Well, that actually is packaged on the regular one, too.
2535279	2540307	I know it didn't make the story here on the site, but I read it somewhere else that the Xbox Live Silver will be on both sets.
2540367	2541129	So at least you get that.
2541509	2541930	What would you do?
2543060	2551664	What strikes me as interesting though, okay, I maybe understand why they omitted the hard drive from the Xbox 360, because honestly, how often did you use it with the original Xbox?
2551744	2555785	Granted, you could load your own songs, but how many games really supported that?
2556025	2556646	Not a lot.
2557386	2562568	I don't know, we put on a bunch of Initial D soundtracks from, what was it, Midnight Club?
2563374	2566077	Yeah, but how... but not a lot of games supported it.
2566838	2568099	I mean, a few, but not a lot.
2568619	2573905	And, um, it's not like you could... a lot of games use the hard drive for their data.
2573965	2578950	I mean, it's saved, but nothing that a memory card wouldn't be able to fit unless you're a real hardcore gamer.
2579711	2579771	Um...
2581109	2587494	But now I'm thinking, okay, but now you're also talking with Xbox 360 that Final Fantasy XI is one of your big titles.
2587874	2591597	You have to have a hard drive for Final Fantasy XI because of all the freaking patches they do.
2592218	2593819	So if you want to play Final Fantasy XI...
2596018	2596959	Well, yeah, most likely.
2597399	2600120	So, just very interesting there.
2601441	2605803	Really, to play all the really big games, you're going to have to chuck down the $400 anyway.
2606203	2612827	I suppose maybe if you just want Madden, you're just a light gamer, maybe the $300 one will do you.
2613187	2619911	But most people that listen to this program probably consider themselves hardcore enough where that $300 set just doesn't cut it.
2620751	2622792	So, very interesting.
2623252	2624493	DarkSakura, any other thoughts on that?
2626280	2627822	Oh yeah, I know I'm going to have to get the premium.
2627862	2628342	I have to.
2628402	2631846	I want the HD cables and I want the wireless controller and the hard drive.
2632286	2633668	So I have to check down the $400.
2634749	2637993	But I'm just kind of... Well, in the end, it's a better economical decision anyway.
2638333	2640775	Well, I guess, but $400 is still a lot of money.
2640876	2645781	But I suppose most systems were around $400 when they first came out anyway, so...
2647695	2650956	They lost a lot of money when the Xbox first came out.
2651416	2664460	I think this is a way for them to make something that looks a little bit more affordable and attractive for the casual gamer or for someone who doesn't have a lot of money or doesn't have the high-definition setup you or I have.
2665440	2668661	It makes it a little bit more affordable, makes it a little bit more attractive.
2669441	2673742	And then for those of us who have all this stuff, who would lay down that kind of money...
2674639	2677801	You know, they're like, hey, we've got some goodies for you, we'll save you some money.
2677921	2686007	I suppose what makes some of us angsty out there is that we're looking at this going, oh man, you mean we gotta pay $100 for the stuff we need anyway?
2686607	2687328	As gamers?
2687768	2691631	I think that's where we kind of feel like, oh jeez, we're being nickeled and dimed again.
2691931	2693032	But I understand what you're saying.
2693072	2700597	By having the $300 set, it makes Xbox 360 more accessible, so to speak, to a broader game audience.
2700617	2704300	Those folks that, you know, they just want the new Madden game or, you know, whatever it is.
2705267	2707769	I think it's a really smart move on Microsoft's part.
2707869	2708309	I really do.
2708589	2711011	Well, we shall see when the sales figures come out, shall we?
2712071	2712372	Oh, yes.
2712452	2713772	I will be paying attention to that.
2714273	2720196	I read a really neat article in Time about the 360.
2720957	2723779	This article came out about the time that we were all at E3.
2723799	2728461	I'm just saying about how much money they lost on it.
2728501	2732704	With the design of the system, they designed something that would be attractive...
2733137	2734758	to the Japanese market as well.
2735439	2739402	Now, I'd love to see if they're going to be doing the same thing there that they are here.
2740403	2740683	Hmm.
2741624	2742024	What's that?
2742825	2744726	About having the multiple packages.
2746147	2746427	Okay.
2746568	2748189	The with and without package, basically.
2748729	2749069	Alright.
2749390	2749670	We'll see.
2750117	2750417	OriginXbox360.com
2770882	2773744	What's interesting is there's a timer counting down.
2773944	2778287	And what's also interesting is that the domain was registered by Microsoft.
2779748	2784691	So is it another one of those big, like, you know, we like bees or whatever that site was called.
2784751	2785071	I love bees.
2785091	2785951	Yeah, viral campaigns.
2786372	2794797	Possibly the website by, you know, people looking at it, they figured out that it's going to end on September 27th, I believe, at...
2797932	2802455	12 Eastern and no one really knows what the hell it is.
2802535	2804076	They just know that it's a countdown thing.
2804196	2811101	It's got this kind of a picture of a tree and it's cut out of a bunny and it looks Xbox 360 will have bunny love?
2815204	2817705	That's their answer to Nintendogs.
2817885	2818626	Micro bunnies.
2821648	2822148	That's it.
2822308	2823629	I'm laughing now but
2824761	2826242	You know something like that could actually happen.
2826282	2828163	You know something like that could actually happen.
2828183	2829623	It'll be their answer to Nintendogs.
2829643	2830524	It'll be Microbunnies.
2830564	2831444	Yeah, Microbunnies.
2831484	2836907	You turn around, you walk away, you get something to drink, you come back, there's 400 of them on the screen.
2838108	2839328	And what are we going to get next?
2839448	2840189	Playcats?
2841349	2841850	Oh, God.
2841950	2847993	Anyway, so there's some weird site, and it's basically you can access it at www.
2849366	2857329	Origin, and this is O-R-I-G-N Xbox360.com And you've got the countdown here.
2857349	2858309	You can go check it out.
2858689	2859789	Figure out what it's about.
2860150	2860690	Who knows?
2861870	2862510	It's kind of weird.
2863291	2863871	But anyways.
2865086	2871709	Then on to the subject of something else, which would be the Nintendo Revolution.
2872549	2881492	There has been a comment made by Peter Mullenux at Lionhead Studios, the studio behind Black and White and Fable.
2883573	2891476	He's basically quizzed at some European games convention about the revolution.
2891676	2893777	He's basically said this, and this is his quote.
2894558	2900302	There is a line at the end of the book, Game Over, and it is, Never underestimate Nintendo.
2900562	2902264	That is all I can say about the controller.
2903825	2904826	Hmm.
2905006	2906467	Things that make you go, hmm.
2906507	2907728	Well, basically, you know what?
2907848	2911110	It's been the same thing from all these other different publishers I've been looking at.
2911150	2915873	They're like, I can't say anything under strict NDR, but don't count them out.
2916874	2917455	Interesting.
2917755	2919616	So we'll have to wait until the end of the year to find out.
2920537	2921938	You know that Nintendo's kind of been...
2922737	2934881	With the DS, they kind of changed the controller a little bit, because the controller is a pen, and you never really saw that in a gaming system before, so Nintendo's kind of been on this kick lately, so it'll be very interesting to see what happens.
2935661	2937002	They're bringing back the U-Force!
2937382	2937962	No, God, no.
2938002	2938222	No!
2938382	2940203	How about the Power Glove?
2940263	2940843	It's so bad.
2940863	2941683	The Activator!
2942243	2942563	Alright.
2943164	2944344	Anything else you got for us tonight, Loki?
2944784	2946065	And finally... Yes.
2946725	2948725	Happy birthday to you!
2949086	2950186	Happy birthday, Mario, you're 20.
2951923	2953224	Wow, he's still youngin'.
2953785	2954486	Yeah, he's a youngin'.
2954506	2956568	He's got a lot to learn.
2956588	2964737	Nintendo has officially launched the Mario's happy birthday site, nintendo.co.jp slash mario20th.
2964857	2965097	Yes.
2967139	2970963	And on behalf of Orange Lounge Radio, we'd like to apologize to Mario.
2971023	2973526	We are sorry, but your cake is in another castle.
2976256	2980599	It's a mushroom cake It'll actually be coming out
3005768	3006228	In September.
3007328	3008388	Oh, you know a release date for this?
3009089	3010109	It's mid-September.
3010949	3018250	Dig Dug is armed with a collection of weapons such as rocks, lava, and quicksand to defeat the baddies that are in his way.
3018350	3019210	So that should be interesting.
3020010	3021511	Also, multiplayer.
3021531	3023111	Junior assistant Mr. Driller.
3023931	3025331	They are saying multiplayer.
3025411	3027052	Two players in this game.
3027472	3028292	So it should be interesting.
3029392	3030132	That'll be really cool.
3030232	3031472	Did you have any other stories for us tonight?
3031512	3031993	I have that.
3034173	3034473	I'm sorry?
3035427	3035947	DarkSakura.com
3062901	3064262	Core Hotels.
3064782	3069344	This is a hotel chain in Southern California and it's one of those really swanky hotel things.
3069885	3073626	They offer a PlayStation 2 and PSP.
3074066	3080349	Basically what it is is that if you stay in their rooms you get free use of a PSP handheld or a PlayStation 2.
3081030	3081510	Get this.
3082010	3086932	Each hotel has a resident game butler who helps you install and use the systems.
3086993	3088053	How would that be for a job?
3088113	3089914	Being the game butler at one of these hotels?
3090394	3091034	Very interesting.
3091395	3092095	By the way, if you're...
3093357	3106122	If you're thinking that this is a good way to check out one of these systems, think again, because staying at core hotels will cost you well over several hundred dollars per night, so you might as well just buy yourself a PlayStation 2 or a PSP.
3106923	3108083	I can top that.
3108663	3109644	Oh, what do you have?
3111724	3115946	It's just been announced that... I've got one more story.
3116286	3119387	No, no, no, I want to save mine for last, because mine's great.
3119848	3120388	You read yours.
3121277	3126601	Well, you know, Nokia will just try anything to get their product out there.
3126682	3132126	So Nokia, to combat the PSP being a hotel, they have the Nokia N-Gage Deck Chair.
3132546	3134828	That's right, folks, the N-Gage Deck Chair.
3135649	3141774	What you can do, basically, is they're going to be putting these out at different venues out there.
3142275	3142415	And...
3144517	3155527	What's going to happen is they're actually going to be sitting in a chair with a crappy umbrella attached to it and this crappy end gauge attached to it.
3156047	3157589	It looks like crap.
3158269	3165496	It's going to be touring a number of festivals including Carleen Leeds and Reading Festival.
3165796	3166857	I've never heard of it.
3166997	3167397	Whatever.
3167898	3170300	Honestly, folks, it's going to suck.
3171021	3171121	Right.
3174111	3176072	Even the deck chair looks uncomfortable.
3176152	3178212	It's like the deck chair was put together wrong.
3178252	3178732	You know what's funny?
3178772	3182013	I went to IHOP today and I saw somebody playing an N-Gage.
3182853	3187134	And that's probably only the second time I have ever seen somebody playing an N-Gage.
3187154	3188235	Their parents don't love them.
3188515	3189375	No, it was like an adult.
3189655	3192436	Like an upper 20s looking guy.
3192756	3195456	And that's probably only the second time I've ever seen somebody playing an N-Gage.
3195496	3198477	Like not in a GameStop demo or something.
3199077	3199397	Crazy.
3199597	3200137	You know what?
3200338	3202138	In the N-Gage's defense...
3203047	3205408	A system is only as good as the games that are on it.
3206668	3209528	Unfortunately, it doesn't really have any good games anyway.
3210449	3214949	Alright, now, DarkSakura, you tell me which story was better, Loki's final story or my final story.
3216010	3219810	Linda Carter will be joining the cast of Elder Scrolls 4.
3219951	3222811	Dude, Wonder Woman!
3222871	3223531	Yes, that's right.
3223591	3231093	Linda Carter, best known as Wonder Woman, or should I say Wonder Woman, is going to be joining the cast of this game, Elder Scrolls 4.
3231173	3231253	And
3232652	3234433	What else do you really need to know about the game?
3234673	3236695	I mean, seriously, it's got Wonder Woman in it.
3236775	3237235	Who cares?
3239076	3239616	All right, fine.
3239636	3240857	That is freaking awesome.
3240997	3243839	It's, you know, a role-playing game, basically.
3245059	3250523	You're in this fantasy realm of Tamriel where the gates to a hellish underworld are going to be opened.
3250943	3252624	But never fear, Wonder Woman is here.
3252644	3255185	But never fear, Wonder Woman's here with her golden lasso.
3255205	3256426	With her golden lasso.
3256646	3257007	All right.
3258167	3258788	You know what?
3258808	3259268	Mm-hmm.
3259941	3260622	Wait, directed by?
3290055	3293158	I believe... Written by Joss.
3293218	3294019	That's cool.
3294119	3298804	Don't send me hate mail if I'm wrong, but I believe it's written and directed by the one and only Joss.
3298824	3299945	So you puffy fans.
3299965	3302167	Then that means it's going to be done fabulously well.
3302207	3304569	He was also writing X-Men for a little while.
3304730	3305250	Alright, well...
3307045	3310367	We'll save that to the Buffy fans podcast, if there is one.
3310447	3312228	I would think there's got to be a Buffy podcast out there.
3312248	3313268	I'm going to go look for one right now.
3314429	3314789	Anyway.
3314929	3317830	That sounds like a waste of time.
3318631	3324134	It's time for the final thoughts before DarkSakura jumps through the sky blind and strangles Loki for knocking Buffy.
3324934	3326055	Loki, your final thought.
3326095	3331197	Did that guy actually come up with the really retarded concept of an invisible flying jet?
3332738	3332918	Yep.
3334042	3335684	Why couldn't you just make her fly?
3336084	3337846	An invisible jet is retarded.
3339047	3341389	Because she's an Amazon or something.
3341409	3343191	Oh, so she can't fly.
3343571	3344212	She's a woman.
3344252	3345513	That's why she can't fly.
3346774	3347114	Hey!
3349236	3350157	She has to fly a jet.
3350417	3351478	She's going to punch you next week.
