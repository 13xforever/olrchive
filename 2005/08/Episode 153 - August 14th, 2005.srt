3
00:04:34,017 --> 00:04:37,939
[SPEAKER_17]: After taking last week kind of a mini-vacation.

4
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:41,260
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, there was still a show, but it wasn't the show-show, right?

5
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,040
[SPEAKER_02]: I was there.

6
00:04:42,441 --> 00:04:45,802
[SPEAKER_17]: You were there, but it wasn't the OLR experience, so to say.

7
00:04:45,842 --> 00:04:50,363
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the DarkSakura... We were recording the podcast while we were broadcasting.

8
00:04:51,904 --> 00:04:53,865
[SPEAKER_17]: So it was the Let's Multitask show.

9
00:04:53,965 --> 00:04:54,025
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

10
00:04:55,228 --> 00:05:00,172
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway, tonight, though, I'm back after being gone for two weeks, because I know there was a show a couple weeks ago.

11
00:05:00,232 --> 00:05:01,033
[SPEAKER_17]: Did you enjoy your box?

12
00:05:01,353 --> 00:05:03,295
[SPEAKER_17]: I enjoyed the FedEx box immensely.

13
00:05:03,355 --> 00:05:04,376
[SPEAKER_17]: I was popping on the Bubba app.

14
00:05:04,817 --> 00:05:08,900
[SPEAKER_17]: So on tonight's show, we're going to talk about my East Coast tournament I went to.

15
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,803
[SPEAKER_17]: I went to an East Coast tournament, and I saw it in the group, too.

16
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:13,804
[SPEAKER_17]: So I can't wait to talk about that.

17
00:05:14,285 --> 00:05:17,588
[SPEAKER_17]: And also, we're going to talk about the DDR with fire.

18
00:05:19,229 --> 00:05:21,131

[SPEAKER_08]: Yep, that's true.

42
00:08:19,928 --> 00:08:20,388
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not sure.

43
00:08:20,408 --> 00:08:21,069
[SPEAKER_18]: Turn that on.

44
00:08:21,249 --> 00:08:21,650
[SPEAKER_08]: Make sure it's on.

45
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:22,070
[SPEAKER_08]: It is on.

46
00:08:24,414 --> 00:08:25,815
[SPEAKER_17]: It's on, but very quiet.

47
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:26,855
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know what's going on over there.

48
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:27,395
[SPEAKER_17]: Weird.

49
00:08:27,435 --> 00:08:27,616
[SPEAKER_17]: Here.

50
00:08:28,036 --> 00:08:28,916
[SPEAKER_08]: Shit.

51
00:08:30,897 --> 00:08:32,058
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

52
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:32,958
[SPEAKER_17]: Canter that one.

53
00:08:33,078 --> 00:08:33,538
[SPEAKER_17]: See if that works.

54
00:08:33,959 --> 00:08:34,299
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry.

55
00:08:34,459 --> 00:08:34,999
[SPEAKER_17]: Sound problems.

56
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:35,960
[SPEAKER_17]: Are you there now?

57
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:36,560
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm here.

58
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:36,840
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, guys.

59
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:37,300
[SPEAKER_17]: There you are.

60
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,181
[SPEAKER_17]: That's weird.

61
00:08:38,441 --> 00:08:39,541
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, we'll fix that during the break.

62
00:08:40,182 --> 00:08:41,222
[SPEAKER_17]: Also, here is Loki.

63
00:08:42,003 --> 00:08:42,363
[SPEAKER_17]: I am here.

64
00:08:43,443 --> 00:08:44,064
[SPEAKER_17]: Barely.

65
00:08:44,424 --> 00:08:45,704
[SPEAKER_17]: You ran in during the intro there.

66
00:08:45,724 --> 00:08:46,305
[SPEAKER_17]: We were worried.

67
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:48,926
[SPEAKER_17]: I was looking for a song for Cage Match, and...

68
00:08:50,123 --> 00:08:52,204
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh shit, I gotta get a song for Cage Match, don't I?

69
00:08:52,224 --> 00:08:54,265
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what I've been doing for the last two hours.

70
00:08:54,685 --> 00:08:55,065
[SPEAKER_08]: I did?

71
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:58,246
[SPEAKER_08]: You just never left instructions on how to upload the damn thing.

72
00:08:59,467 --> 00:08:59,887
[SPEAKER_17]: I won?

73
00:08:59,927 --> 00:09:00,667
[SPEAKER_17]: How'd that happen?

74
00:09:00,747 --> 00:09:02,788
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, I picked a song at the last minute.

75
00:09:03,128 --> 00:09:03,808
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, well, whatever.

76
00:09:04,189 --> 00:09:04,469
[SPEAKER_17]: Cool.

77
00:09:04,909 --> 00:09:05,929
[SPEAKER_17]: Good, I don't have to pick a song tonight.

78
00:09:06,389 --> 00:09:06,690
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright.

79
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:07,890
[SPEAKER_17]: Good.

80
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:08,850
[SPEAKER_17]: A little stressed there.

81
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:10,251
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fine.

82
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:13,612
[SPEAKER_17]: That's alright, we'll figure out a contingency plan.

83
00:09:13,632 --> 00:09:15,073
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll put it in double or something.

84
00:09:16,502 --> 00:09:23,326
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, so anywho, we're gonna go to a quick break featuring some music from the DDR while we figure out what happened to Jamie's microphone.

85
00:09:23,846 --> 00:09:29,089
[SPEAKER_17]: And also, we'll just, you know, get comfortable and get ready to do some chatting.

86
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,381
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to talk about fire tonight, Loki.

87
00:09:31,981 --> 00:09:32,341
[SPEAKER_17]: I know.

88
00:09:32,861 --> 00:09:33,982
[SPEAKER_17]: You know that's coming up.

89
00:09:34,482 --> 00:09:36,323
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to talk about In The Groove, too, as well.

90
00:09:36,864 --> 00:09:39,185
[SPEAKER_17]: I have In The Groove, actually.

91
00:09:39,545 --> 00:09:43,407
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, I heard that this came up while I was gone, so you've got to fill me in on this.

92
00:09:44,647 --> 00:09:47,389
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll be back after this quick break featuring some music from Dead DDR.

93
00:09:47,689 --> 00:09:51,191
[SPEAKER_17]: Actually, this first song is also an In The Groove song, kind of, sort of.

94
00:09:52,051 --> 00:09:52,571
[SPEAKER_17]: Kind of, sort of.

95
00:09:52,591 --> 00:09:53,332
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll be back after this.

96
00:09:56,106 --> 00:09:57,328
Thanks for watching!

97
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:56,098
I just did my own love for you I need to know, I need to know, I need to know how you feel I gotta know, I gotta know, I gotta know if it's real I need to know, I need to know, I need to know how you feel I gotta know, I gotta know, I gotta know if it's real

98
00:12:03,633 --> 00:12:06,574
I'm giving all my heart to you, my love I justify my love for you

99
00:12:29,256 --> 00:12:32,337
I'm giving you my heart, my soul, my love I used to cry my love for you

100
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:29,702
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a long way to go, honey.

101
00:14:30,824 --> 00:14:33,287
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, but I'm afraid.

102
00:14:33,307 --> 00:14:35,731
[SPEAKER_06]: Where are we going?

103
00:14:35,771 --> 00:14:38,375
[SPEAKER_06]: Into the Dark Black Forest.

104
00:15:53,637 --> 00:15:56,239
[SPEAKER_06]: into the dark, black forest.

105
00:16:22,819 --> 00:16:23,319
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm back.

106
00:16:23,499 --> 00:16:25,700
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm back from my trip that I went to the East Coast.

107
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:28,921
[SPEAKER_17]: I was sent in FedEx packaging, courtesy of Loki and DarkSakura.

108
00:16:29,061 --> 00:16:30,842
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm glad that they treated you well.

109
00:16:31,162 --> 00:16:38,584
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, they actually lost some of our shipments the other week, so I was like, hey, he might be gone.

110
00:16:38,744 --> 00:16:39,745
[SPEAKER_17]: We might never get him back.

111
00:16:40,285 --> 00:16:45,047
[SPEAKER_17]: Actually, FedEx was full, so I had to suffer a fate worse than FedEx.

112
00:16:45,107 --> 00:16:46,327
[SPEAKER_17]: I had to fly Southwest.

113
00:16:47,369 --> 00:16:47,989
[SPEAKER_17]: Thanks for watching!

114
00:17:04,185 --> 00:17:09,410
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh lord, try spending five hours on a plane with Grandpa, who's really, really obese.

115
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:17,638
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, you know, not that there's anything wrong with being really obese, but when you're trying to sit next to me on a plane, it's like, you know, I've got no wiggle room whatsoever.

116
00:17:17,658 --> 00:17:18,899
[SPEAKER_17]: So what were your in-flight movies?

117
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:21,762
[SPEAKER_17]: It's Southwest, there is no in-flight movies.

118
00:17:23,023 --> 00:17:24,244
[SPEAKER_08]: There is when you bring a laptop.

119
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:25,605
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I brought my PSP.

120
00:17:25,766 --> 00:17:29,229
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to talk about that on the podcast, because I did bring my PSP, and...

121
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:34,583
[SPEAKER_17]: Sharks Girl, if you're out there, I love you, because she loaned me movies I could watch on my PSP.

122
00:17:34,903 --> 00:17:41,047
[SPEAKER_17]: And I've always knocked the idea of movies on a PSP, but I take it all back after this trip.

123
00:17:41,087 --> 00:17:42,008
[SPEAKER_17]: I take it all back.

124
00:17:42,088 --> 00:17:43,029
[SPEAKER_17]: I am so sorry.

125
00:17:43,169 --> 00:17:49,533
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm so, so sorry for those comments, because seriously, it saved my ass this week, so I'm very happy.

126
00:17:50,529 --> 00:17:58,851
[SPEAKER_17]: So my in-flight movies were Tron on the way over, which, believe it or not, I'd never seen before, and iRobot on the way back, on PISP, the PSP.

127
00:17:59,391 --> 00:18:12,835
[SPEAKER_17]: So, um, but it didn't stop this grandpa guy from trying to talk to me in his little, not just grandpa, but, um, the daughter, or the grand- the daughter, the granddaughter was in sixth grade, that was kind of one of those, like, scary-looking children.

128
00:18:13,271 --> 00:18:16,913
[SPEAKER_17]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

129
00:18:42,182 --> 00:18:43,362
[SPEAKER_17]: The tiny ass screen.

130
00:18:43,402 --> 00:18:49,204
[SPEAKER_17]: If you thought watching a movie on your PSP was bad, these things have the tiniest screen in the world and the quality just stinks.

131
00:18:50,545 --> 00:18:50,845
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know.

132
00:18:51,225 --> 00:18:56,807
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway, so she was showing off her computer to me and kept asking questions about the PSP and I'm just like, leave me alone.

133
00:18:58,348 --> 00:18:59,708
[SPEAKER_08]: Pretend you didn't speak English.

134
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:01,349
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what I need to do next time.

135
00:19:01,389 --> 00:19:03,469
[SPEAKER_17]: Just bludgeoned her to death with the PSP.

136
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:09,812
[SPEAKER_17]: That's why I need to go see that movie Red Eye because maybe I'll get some ideas from that movie for the next time I go.

137
00:19:10,472 --> 00:19:11,032
[SPEAKER_17]: So we'll see.

138
00:19:11,591 --> 00:19:15,532
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know if we should support any more of Wes Craven's stuff.

139
00:19:15,572 --> 00:19:16,173
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, come on.

140
00:19:17,153 --> 00:19:20,934
[SPEAKER_17]: Do we need to really inspire him to make more Nightmare on Elm Street movies?

141
00:19:20,954 --> 00:19:21,595
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, we do.

142
00:19:21,775 --> 00:19:22,495
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, we do.

143
00:19:22,715 --> 00:19:28,837
[SPEAKER_17]: And we also need to inspire him to make a Scream 4 because I didn't think that those movies were going to be missed at all.

144
00:19:28,997 --> 00:19:33,959
[SPEAKER_17]: But now that they're gone and there's really not been a lot of good horror movies, I kind of miss them.

145
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:34,619
[SPEAKER_17]: Exactly.

146
00:19:34,659 --> 00:19:39,581
[SPEAKER_17]: And what will Scary Movie parody on if they don't make any more Scream movies?

147
00:19:41,104 --> 00:19:41,344
[SPEAKER_17]: DarkSakura

148
00:19:58,388 --> 00:20:12,416
[SPEAKER_08]: I really have been trying to get stuff together because I'm starting school next week, so I didn't really get to play too much except for a little PSO and trying to get Ragnarok to install, but for some reason the Korean Ragnarok won't install on my computer.

149
00:20:13,396 --> 00:20:14,277
[SPEAKER_17]: Is it because it's Korean?

150
00:20:15,049 --> 00:20:16,109
[SPEAKER_08]: Possibly, honestly.

151
00:20:16,709 --> 00:20:20,791
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that they've upgraded on the newest build, so I need a really old build of it.

152
00:20:21,191 --> 00:20:26,572
[SPEAKER_17]: I seem to recall that the Korean, because I think you tried to get, no, who tried to get me to install this once?

153
00:20:26,952 --> 00:20:30,894
[SPEAKER_17]: Somebody was getting me to install the Korean one so that I could patch it to play on a free server.

154
00:20:30,914 --> 00:20:32,874
[SPEAKER_17]: It must have been LankyStyle, because he's all into that.

155
00:20:33,574 --> 00:20:38,816
[SPEAKER_17]: If you think Loki is a pirate, hang out with LankyStyle sometime.

156
00:20:39,726 --> 00:20:42,667
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's see the new Ragnarok Online.

157
00:20:42,727 --> 00:20:43,848
[SPEAKER_17]: It's so advanced.

158
00:20:43,948 --> 00:20:46,189
[SPEAKER_17]: It bans you before you even decide to play.

159
00:20:46,329 --> 00:20:46,809
[SPEAKER_17]: Stop it.

160
00:20:47,189 --> 00:20:51,011
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway, I don't want to cut off DarkSakura, but I tried to install it once.

161
00:20:51,051 --> 00:20:51,891
[SPEAKER_17]: It was a pain in the ass.

162
00:20:51,951 --> 00:20:53,152
[SPEAKER_17]: I had to do all these special things.

163
00:20:53,172 --> 00:20:57,254
[SPEAKER_08]: It just can't initialize, so I need to figure out how to get past that.

164
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:07,758
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, it's just really been... I can't find my Illustrator book, which means I might have to buy another one if I can't find it by Monday.

165
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:09,270
[SPEAKER_17]: Like Adobe Illustrator?

166
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:24,754
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, because one of my classes is Illustrator, the other one is Geography, and then halfway through the next semester I'm taking Dreamweaver and my other technical writing class with a teacher who says I have flawless writing.

167
00:21:25,014 --> 00:21:29,195
[SPEAKER_17]: Which means DarkSakura is going to be doing our site and all the graphics as soon as she graduates school.

168
00:21:29,935 --> 00:21:30,715
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe before then.

169
00:21:31,255 --> 00:21:33,516
[SPEAKER_08]: Or the Orange Lounge site might start becoming homework for me.

170
00:21:35,574 --> 00:21:39,536
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, sort of a half plug for Pump Up the Volume.

171
00:21:41,077 --> 00:21:45,480
[SPEAKER_08]: In a couple weeks I'm going to be doing a demo for Dark Records.

172
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:50,382
[SPEAKER_08]: They just went live this week and friends of mine are behind that.

173
00:21:50,822 --> 00:21:53,004
[SPEAKER_08]: And since I always try to play new music for everybody.

174
00:21:53,304 --> 00:21:55,845
[SPEAKER_17]: We can say the familiar DDR face that's behind a lot of this, right?

175
00:21:56,145 --> 00:22:02,749
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, my iguana girl is working with them, but they're people that, you know, I used to work with one of them.

176
00:22:03,616 --> 00:22:08,240
[SPEAKER_17]: I haven't, I think a lot of this has developed while I was kind of on vacation and tuned out of the world.

177
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,421
[SPEAKER_17]: So what's going on?

178
00:22:09,501 --> 00:22:11,843
[SPEAKER_17]: They're making their own label type thing?

179
00:22:12,123 --> 00:22:16,767
[SPEAKER_08]: They're putting out the first record as a compilation of just different artists in the community.

180
00:22:17,288 --> 00:22:21,491
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm going to be playing all that since I play new music on my show when I can.

181
00:22:21,771 --> 00:22:21,992
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.

182
00:22:22,032 --> 00:22:23,713
[SPEAKER_18]: And isn't it like synth pop, some of it?

183
00:22:23,853 --> 00:22:25,374
[SPEAKER_08]: Some synth pop, goth industrial.

184
00:22:25,535 --> 00:22:25,755
[SPEAKER_17]: Cool.

185
00:22:26,155 --> 00:22:29,798
[SPEAKER_08]: Pretty variant stuff across the angst-ridden level.

186
00:22:29,858 --> 00:22:32,239
[SPEAKER_17]: So possible Ultramix 4 music someday.

187
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:33,400
Maybe.

188
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,181
[SPEAKER_17]: You never know.

189
00:22:34,281 --> 00:22:34,661
[SPEAKER_17]: You never know.

190
00:22:34,681 --> 00:22:35,562
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, that's kind of cool.

191
00:22:36,843 --> 00:22:37,663
[SPEAKER_08]: And all the rest of it.

192
00:22:37,703 --> 00:22:38,624
[SPEAKER_08]: We bought furniture today.

193
00:22:40,445 --> 00:22:44,008
[SPEAKER_08]: Dan bribed me with a bass guitar, which I'm not getting.

194
00:22:44,048 --> 00:22:47,330
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm actually going to pay a trainer instead.

195
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:49,772
[SPEAKER_17]: How exactly do you get bribed with a bass guitar?

196
00:22:50,332 --> 00:22:52,894
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I like the furniture first because it's red suede.

197
00:22:54,266 --> 00:22:55,527
[SPEAKER_08]: But we ended up buying it anyway.

198
00:22:55,847 --> 00:22:59,189
[SPEAKER_08]: We got a big chaise lounge and a couch.

199
00:22:59,489 --> 00:23:02,430
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're going to get back and get end tables for it and everything.

200
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:03,351
[SPEAKER_08]: It's comfy.

201
00:23:03,891 --> 00:23:04,431
[SPEAKER_08]: And suede.

202
00:23:04,691 --> 00:23:04,872
[SPEAKER_08]: Cool.

203
00:23:04,912 --> 00:23:06,713
[SPEAKER_08]: And the cat is not allowed anywhere near it.

204
00:23:07,413 --> 00:23:08,373
[SPEAKER_08]: And Shermie stopped peeking.

205
00:23:08,994 --> 00:23:09,394
[SPEAKER_17]: That's good.

206
00:23:09,434 --> 00:23:10,875
[SPEAKER_17]: What happened with your kitty?

207
00:23:10,915 --> 00:23:11,355
[SPEAKER_08]: Cat flew.

208
00:23:11,415 --> 00:23:12,295
[SPEAKER_08]: We think she had West Nile.

209
00:23:14,717 --> 00:23:15,597
[SPEAKER_08]: Someone I know had it.

210
00:23:16,197 --> 00:23:16,558
[SPEAKER_17]: Really?

211
00:23:16,798 --> 00:23:17,058
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

212
00:23:17,401 --> 00:23:18,924
[SPEAKER_17]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

213
00:23:28,982 --> 00:23:30,462
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, I thought it was just Sacramento had the problem.

214
00:23:30,682 --> 00:23:31,703
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, no, no.

215
00:23:31,803 --> 00:23:33,763
[SPEAKER_08]: One of my good friends lives in the D.C.

216
00:23:33,823 --> 00:23:34,083
[SPEAKER_08]: area.

217
00:23:35,523 --> 00:23:36,363
[SPEAKER_08]: She knew people who had it.

218
00:23:36,423 --> 00:23:39,064
[SPEAKER_08]: They're spraying out there, too, and the spray makes her sick.

219
00:23:39,144 --> 00:23:41,064
[SPEAKER_17]: I thought the spray was only happening out here.

220
00:23:41,084 --> 00:23:42,384
[SPEAKER_17]: No, this is all over the country.

221
00:23:42,404 --> 00:23:42,885
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, dang.

222
00:23:43,345 --> 00:23:44,085
[SPEAKER_17]: Shows how much I know.

223
00:23:44,225 --> 00:23:46,645
[SPEAKER_08]: And typically in more humid areas, but still.

224
00:23:47,885 --> 00:23:49,106
[SPEAKER_17]: That would not be Sacramento.

225
00:23:49,246 --> 00:23:51,486
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I know, but we also do have a floodplain.

226
00:23:52,526 --> 00:23:54,627
[SPEAKER_08]: And standing water does pool.

227
00:23:55,907 --> 00:23:56,087
[SPEAKER_08]: But...

228
00:23:58,642 --> 00:24:09,650
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, what I was trying to say about that is, I don't know if this is possible, maybe Shermie might have had some type of variant or something, because she would eat and then throw up and then cry pathetically.

229
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:12,492
[SPEAKER_17]: You want to hear something really gross about what I got from a bug once?

230
00:24:12,792 --> 00:24:13,033
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

231
00:24:13,233 --> 00:24:17,536
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, I once fell asleep on my couch, like out in the living room or something.

232
00:24:17,576 --> 00:24:18,557
[SPEAKER_17]: This was when I was living in Chico.

233
00:24:18,857 --> 00:24:21,599
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think I fell asleep with my mouth open.

234
00:24:21,619 --> 00:24:23,440
[SPEAKER_17]: You know how some people have their mouths open a little bit?

235
00:24:23,741 --> 00:24:26,603
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I think a bug got in there and bit me on my gums.

236
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:32,574
[SPEAKER_17]: because the next day my gum swelled up hella big and they were bleeding and stuff.

237
00:24:32,975 --> 00:24:35,357
[SPEAKER_17]: Imagine if you didn't brush your teeth for a year.

238
00:24:36,678 --> 00:24:38,099
[SPEAKER_08]: You're almost describing scurvy.

239
00:24:39,233 --> 00:24:40,454
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe I caught scurvy.

240
00:24:42,255 --> 00:24:42,956
[SPEAKER_08]: And seed deficiency.

241
00:24:43,456 --> 00:24:43,736
[SPEAKER_17]: Wow.

242
00:24:44,717 --> 00:24:46,838
[SPEAKER_17]: And your teeth start falling out and your gums start to bleed.

243
00:24:47,058 --> 00:24:50,521
[SPEAKER_17]: No, my teeth didn't fall out and everything went away like three days later.

244
00:24:50,641 --> 00:24:52,582
[SPEAKER_17]: But it was really disgusting during the process.

245
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:59,426
[SPEAKER_17]: And that was the only thing I could think of is that I must have been bitten by a bug because one part of it was slightly swollen, so I think it was a bug bite.

246
00:24:59,447 --> 00:25:00,947
[SPEAKER_17]: It was very similar to a mosquito bite.

247
00:25:01,228 --> 00:25:02,248
[SPEAKER_08]: That's icky poo.

248
00:25:02,789 --> 00:25:03,829
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway, just thought I'd share.

249
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:04,950
[SPEAKER_08]: Fun!

250
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:06,151
[SPEAKER_17]: Enjoy that lovely image.

251
00:25:06,653 --> 00:25:07,014
[SPEAKER_17]: America.

252
00:25:07,915 --> 00:25:10,177
[SPEAKER_08]: Otherwise, it's just been busy.

253
00:25:11,559 --> 00:25:12,641
[SPEAKER_08]: Busy, busy, busy.

254
00:25:13,722 --> 00:25:14,022
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

255
00:25:14,042 --> 00:25:14,883
[SPEAKER_17]: No, it's alright.

256
00:25:15,604 --> 00:25:16,586
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been sleepy all day.

257
00:25:16,606 --> 00:25:17,487
[SPEAKER_08]: I had coffee.

258
00:25:17,887 --> 00:25:18,588
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't do anything.

259
00:25:18,969 --> 00:25:20,270
[SPEAKER_17]: I slept for 12 hours last night.

260
00:25:21,772 --> 00:25:22,693
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Jetlag.

261
00:25:23,735 --> 00:25:25,577
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, not just that, but the fact that

262
00:25:26,403 --> 00:25:29,664
[SPEAKER_17]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

263
00:25:49,827 --> 00:25:51,828
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know, I could say my week has been okay.

264
00:25:51,868 --> 00:25:53,829
[SPEAKER_17]: Nelly's week has been kind of on the rocks.

265
00:25:54,289 --> 00:25:57,010
[SPEAKER_17]: First, she started off her week by having her car stolen.

266
00:25:57,330 --> 00:25:57,910
[SPEAKER_17]: That sucks.

267
00:25:58,611 --> 00:26:01,172
[SPEAKER_17]: And, yeah, so I've had to drive her around places and stuff.

268
00:26:01,712 --> 00:26:04,973
[SPEAKER_17]: And then she found a wedding dress yesterday, so that was kind of cool.

269
00:26:06,073 --> 00:26:13,056
[SPEAKER_17]: And otherwise, what I've been doing this week has been utilizing the internet for my advantage.

270
00:26:13,436 --> 00:26:14,797
[SPEAKER_17]: That's the best way to put it.

271
00:26:15,377 --> 00:26:41,657
[SPEAKER_17]: and because of that I have gotten to play so many damn games it's not even funny and um oh yesterday I went and bought a DVD burner because I had to upgrade my uh um pirating ability um to be able to burn DVDs that and just I need it for wedding stuff as well and then um so I had to install my CD burner into my mom's computer which I'm sure she'll be grateful for but she won't know how to use and um

272
00:26:42,654 --> 00:26:43,274
[SPEAKER_17]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

273
00:27:04,299 --> 00:27:08,081
[SPEAKER_17]: It's unlimited bandwidth, but it's like $14.95 a month.

274
00:27:08,441 --> 00:27:16,065
[SPEAKER_17]: And then the other server thing I'm on, which is basically a list, is $0.50 a month, I think.

275
00:27:17,285 --> 00:27:20,647
[SPEAKER_17]: And so I just basically signed up for that.

276
00:27:20,787 --> 00:27:22,047
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to try it out for a month.

277
00:27:22,328 --> 00:27:24,549
[SPEAKER_17]: If it's something I'm interested in, then yeah, I'll go for it.

278
00:27:24,589 --> 00:27:25,389
[SPEAKER_17]: Probably not, though, because

279
00:27:25,882 --> 00:27:28,004
[SPEAKER_17]: They don't have everything I'm looking for on there.

280
00:27:29,566 --> 00:27:32,549
[SPEAKER_17]: It's nice because I can download files really fast.

281
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:40,438
[SPEAKER_17]: I love it, by the way, that you refuse to pay for anything, but you'll pay for the program to let you play.

282
00:27:40,871 --> 00:27:42,152
[SPEAKER_17]: All this software.

283
00:27:42,352 --> 00:27:48,176
[SPEAKER_17]: But if you think about it, though, because I've been trying to get... Speaking of which, I'm getting back into the music stuff.

284
00:27:48,216 --> 00:27:49,377
[SPEAKER_17]: I bought two sample CDs.

285
00:27:49,658 --> 00:27:51,779
[SPEAKER_17]: I bought one sample CD from BT, which is $100.

286
00:27:51,819 --> 00:27:57,423
[SPEAKER_17]: I bought another one, or I'm bidding on one that started off at $39.99.

287
00:27:57,583 --> 00:28:02,627
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't get you, because when you do spend money, you spend like $100 on a fucking CD.

288
00:28:03,127 --> 00:28:03,648
[SPEAKER_17]: Two CDs.

289
00:28:04,508 --> 00:28:05,069
[SPEAKER_17]: My bad.

290
00:28:05,189 --> 00:28:05,689
[SPEAKER_17]: My bad.

291
00:28:05,769 --> 00:28:06,410
[SPEAKER_17]: Two CDs.

292
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:09,532
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, it's because I can't get it anywhere else.

293
00:28:09,712 --> 00:28:11,153
[SPEAKER_17]: It's no longer being made.

294
00:28:11,213 --> 00:28:12,774
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not on anywhere.

295
00:28:12,974 --> 00:28:19,059
[SPEAKER_17]: Trust me, I've looked at all the free angles for this first before I go and actually buy something like this.

296
00:28:19,299 --> 00:28:20,780
[SPEAKER_17]: They're just not selling it anymore.

297
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:27,144
[SPEAKER_17]: So, I wanted to get it because BT is the fucking man when it comes to, you know, awesome breakbeats and that type of stuff.

298
00:28:27,224 --> 00:28:33,569
[SPEAKER_17]: And so, I have, like, one CD is basically all drum loops and stuff and the other one is all kind of like, you know, ambient sound kind of crap.

299
00:28:34,133 --> 00:28:35,294
[SPEAKER_17]: So I got those.

300
00:28:35,674 --> 00:28:36,715
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I got the one at least.

301
00:28:36,735 --> 00:28:37,675
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know about the other one.

302
00:28:37,695 --> 00:28:38,576
[SPEAKER_17]: I still have to wait on that.

303
00:28:38,736 --> 00:28:44,659
[SPEAKER_17]: And then just pretty much waiting for that stuff to come in and audio software stuff, which is worth over $2,000.

304
00:28:46,481 --> 00:28:48,882
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyways, but I'm merely trying it out.

305
00:28:48,982 --> 00:28:51,183
[SPEAKER_17]: I will delete it after 24 hours.

306
00:28:51,223 --> 00:28:51,864
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, sure you will.

307
00:28:51,884 --> 00:28:52,444
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, okay.

308
00:28:52,504 --> 00:28:55,086
[SPEAKER_17]: No, but honestly, what a load of crap is that, too?

309
00:28:55,366 --> 00:29:00,329
[SPEAKER_17]: Who said that that is a law, that you can download the program as long as you delete it within 24 hours?

310
00:29:00,369 --> 00:29:01,510
[SPEAKER_17]: Somebody made that shit up.

311
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:01,990
[SPEAKER_17]: You know it.

312
00:29:02,789 --> 00:29:04,050
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm just trying to stuff out.

313
00:29:05,991 --> 00:29:07,791
[SPEAKER_17]: I've been having a lot of fun with my HD loader.

314
00:29:08,132 --> 00:29:08,792
[SPEAKER_17]: That's all I have to say.

315
00:29:09,272 --> 00:29:14,835
[SPEAKER_08]: I still think that you should tell all those people who say that using acid sucks to go bite your ass or something.

316
00:29:14,935 --> 00:29:17,176
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, that's why I'm going to create some good music with acid.

317
00:29:18,316 --> 00:29:20,077
[SPEAKER_17]: But I need the good samples because I'm lazy.

318
00:29:20,317 --> 00:29:21,598
[SPEAKER_08]: There was my point, though.

319
00:29:23,198 --> 00:29:24,459
[SPEAKER_08]: DJ Danger Mouse uses acid.

320
00:29:24,898 --> 00:29:25,438
[SPEAKER_17]: Absolutely.

321
00:29:25,939 --> 00:29:33,924
[SPEAKER_17]: For those that are kind of newer listeners to the show that don't know about the acid debate, Bomani Style once had a remix contest a while ago.

322
00:29:33,984 --> 00:29:35,906
[SPEAKER_17]: They have a remix contest going on now.

323
00:29:35,926 --> 00:29:38,568
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, they don't have anything going on now because their site's been down a couple days.

324
00:29:39,128 --> 00:29:40,829
[SPEAKER_17]: It was up this morning.

325
00:29:41,209 --> 00:29:41,850
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe it's up again.

326
00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:42,130
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know.

327
00:29:42,526 --> 00:29:48,228
[SPEAKER_17]: But anyway, they had a remix contest a while back and they said no mashups and nothing done in Acid type thing, right?

328
00:29:48,608 --> 00:29:51,628
[SPEAKER_17]: And so come to find out, like a bunch of popular DJs use Acid.

329
00:29:51,929 --> 00:29:57,230
[SPEAKER_17]: We got MidiHead on the show, asked him how he did his remixes for Ultramix 2 and he said Acid.

330
00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:00,731
[SPEAKER_17]: Now to be fair, he all seizes free loops.

331
00:30:00,751 --> 00:30:02,491
[SPEAKER_14]: He does, but... But who cares?

332
00:30:02,531 --> 00:30:03,932
[SPEAKER_17]: They're both the same damn program.

333
00:30:03,972 --> 00:30:06,693
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, honestly, they're very similar.

334
00:30:06,833 --> 00:30:08,293
[SPEAKER_17]: So, who cares?

335
00:30:09,062 --> 00:30:11,023
[SPEAKER_17]: But yeah, so that's basically my week.

336
00:30:11,063 --> 00:30:14,785
[SPEAKER_17]: It's been a lot of downloading and a lot of Nelly yelling at me, Get out of your computer!

337
00:30:14,845 --> 00:30:16,145
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, that type of thing.

338
00:30:16,646 --> 00:30:19,527
[SPEAKER_17]: Question from chat, are you still relenting over Graffiti Kingdom?

339
00:30:21,048 --> 00:30:25,810
[SPEAKER_17]: I bought Graffiti Kingdom yesterday, but I haven't gotten a chance to play it yet.

340
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:27,250
[SPEAKER_17]: Gotcha.

341
00:30:27,791 --> 00:30:28,291
[SPEAKER_14]: Just curious.

342
00:30:29,191 --> 00:30:34,874
[SPEAKER_17]: It was ironic because my PAL version of it finished downloading right when I bought it, so I was like, okay, fine, I'm just going to stick with this one.

343
00:30:36,014 --> 00:30:37,175
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, that works.

344
00:30:39,048 --> 00:30:42,131
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, well, me, my week and my day, gee.

345
00:30:43,372 --> 00:30:47,575
[SPEAKER_17]: Yesterday was a very interesting day because I left Philadelphia in the morning.

346
00:30:48,076 --> 00:30:50,197
[SPEAKER_17]: I stopped in Phoenix for a three-hour layover.

347
00:30:50,237 --> 00:30:54,101
[SPEAKER_17]: I ended up doing lunch with our webmaster, VxJasonXV, because I happen to be in Phoenix.

348
00:30:54,501 --> 00:30:55,122
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's just kind of neat.

349
00:30:55,402 --> 00:30:58,164
[SPEAKER_17]: I did lunch in Phoenix and then came home.

350
00:30:58,264 --> 00:30:59,445
[SPEAKER_17]: So it was an interesting day yesterday.

351
00:31:00,626 --> 00:31:05,030
[SPEAKER_17]: Of course, I've been doing a lot of work-related, and when I say work, I mean my actual day job.

352
00:31:05,768 --> 00:31:07,109
[SPEAKER_17]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

353
00:31:28,163 --> 00:31:29,364
[SPEAKER_17]: So what was I going to say along those lines?

354
00:31:29,484 --> 00:31:36,731
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, so I have a real job, and my real job sent me away for two weeks because I had some stuff I had to do in the Philadelphia area.

355
00:31:37,712 --> 00:31:46,280
[SPEAKER_17]: So while I was out there, I ended up getting to go to a tournament in Jersey at 8 on the Break in Dunnellan, a little town there.

356
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:47,790
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for watching!

357
00:32:09,915 --> 00:32:36,740
[SPEAKER_17]: Get kind of close to the machine when there's all those people in there Because the area, it's kind of like when they have tournaments at Sunnyvale Golf Land To put it in perspective for you guys Like there's aisles in between the machines They didn't really have, and that kind of surprised me Because I kind of thought, well they have this area with the pool tables Why don't they take the machine and move it into the back area Where there's all this extra room and move the pool tables around But for whatever reason they didn't do that So I got to see in the group too, but I didn't get to play it

358
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:43,204
[SPEAKER_17]: And when I saw it, I was just kind of like, well, it's basically In The Groove 1 with different music and a red interface.

359
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:47,527
[SPEAKER_17]: That's pretty much, I was like, okay, whatever, I don't really get the huge deal.

360
00:32:47,567 --> 00:32:54,611
[SPEAKER_17]: But in a way, that's also the exact same thing you could say about Max 2 versus Max, is that it was just, you know, more songs and a red interface.

361
00:32:54,911 --> 00:32:59,194
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm not going to fault the game for that, but I can't really give you a full review of the game until I actually play it.

362
00:32:59,254 --> 00:33:01,976
[SPEAKER_17]: So I will withhold judgment of In The Groove 2 for a little while.

363
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:03,800
[SPEAKER_17]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

364
00:33:25,379 --> 00:33:30,463
[SPEAKER_17]: And I was kind of like, I was kind of tired because I had a lot going on from the night before and stuff, just, you know, work and everything.

365
00:33:30,503 --> 00:33:33,085
[SPEAKER_17]: So I didn't really feel like being a social butterfly, so I was just kind of lurking.

366
00:33:34,506 --> 00:33:46,215
[SPEAKER_17]: And you know what I think is interesting about DDR tournaments on the East Coast, just like ones on the West Coast, is that, once again, there is that guy at the tournament who really needs to learn about showering regularly and using deodorant.

367
00:33:46,836 --> 00:33:51,039
[SPEAKER_17]: But you don't know who the offender is because there's so many sweaty guys packed in a room together.

368
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:52,680
[SPEAKER_17]: And you're like, ah!

369
00:33:53,261 --> 00:33:53,401
[SPEAKER_17]: So...

370
00:33:55,015 --> 00:33:57,057
[SPEAKER_17]: That doesn't change, West Coast to East Coast.

371
00:33:57,117 --> 00:33:58,498
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry, I don't know what to tell you guys.

372
00:33:58,518 --> 00:33:59,058
[SPEAKER_17]: That doesn't change.

373
00:34:00,459 --> 00:34:03,001
[SPEAKER_17]: But otherwise, in all seriousness, I stayed at the tournament.

374
00:34:03,081 --> 00:34:04,221
[SPEAKER_17]: It looked like it was okay.

375
00:34:04,301 --> 00:34:06,163
[SPEAKER_17]: It looked like it was being pretty efficiently managed.

376
00:34:06,503 --> 00:34:09,145
[SPEAKER_17]: But in all honesty, I didn't end up staying much more than 20 minutes.

377
00:34:09,485 --> 00:34:20,052
[SPEAKER_17]: Like I mentioned, since you didn't get a chance to play In the Groove 2 on the break, In the Groove 2 is actually at our local golf place, Paradise Island.

378
00:34:20,552 --> 00:34:21,013
[SPEAKER_17]: It just came in.

379
00:34:21,033 --> 00:34:21,973
[SPEAKER_17]: Did it officially get there?

380
00:34:22,013 --> 00:34:22,634
[SPEAKER_17]: Officially got there.

381
00:34:22,794 --> 00:34:23,214
[SPEAKER_17]: Interesting.

382
00:34:23,234 --> 00:34:24,115
[SPEAKER_17]: I might have to go check that out.

383
00:34:25,073 --> 00:34:29,297
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, I have one more thing I forgot to say, speaking of tournaments and arcades.

384
00:34:30,357 --> 00:34:31,919
[SPEAKER_08]: Shaft 2 is happening.

385
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:37,523
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got dates in mind, possible sponsorship from GameStop.

386
00:34:39,124 --> 00:34:41,626
[SPEAKER_08]: So in mid-November we're having Shaft 2.

387
00:34:42,447 --> 00:34:42,727
[SPEAKER_17]: Right on.

388
00:34:44,819 --> 00:34:47,180
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll definitely be a big sponsor of that tournament, of course.

389
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,721
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll be whoring that tournament out.

390
00:34:49,961 --> 00:34:53,202
[SPEAKER_17]: And that will be sometime in November, is all we can say right now.

391
00:34:53,342 --> 00:34:56,143
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, and working out of hopefully being able to broadcast live.

392
00:34:57,264 --> 00:35:01,625
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically, Shaft 2 is going to be a DDR tournament and a bowling league tournament.

393
00:35:03,466 --> 00:35:04,346
[SPEAKER_17]: How's that going to work?

394
00:35:04,366 --> 00:35:06,447
[SPEAKER_17]: Because there's no... I don't know.

395
00:35:06,857 --> 00:35:09,039
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, it is at a bowling alley, so there are bowling lanes.

396
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:09,420
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh.

397
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:09,980
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

398
00:35:10,201 --> 00:35:10,481
[SPEAKER_17]: Get it?

399
00:35:10,561 --> 00:35:11,642
[SPEAKER_08]: It's at Fireside Lanes.

400
00:35:12,043 --> 00:35:14,585
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, I didn't realize it was at a bowling... Okay, well, that works.

401
00:35:14,705 --> 00:35:18,449
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, obviously... I was like, how are they going to do bowling in, like, a golf place?

402
00:35:18,589 --> 00:35:28,360
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, actually, we were going to do the tournament at Roseville Golf Land, and we were going to tie ten children down and roll a giant ball at them like you used to see on, like... Roll a Katamari at them so that they stay stuck.

403
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:40,640
[SPEAKER_17]: What was that old show they used to play on USA, which was like, you know, Extreme Games with the Stars, or whatever, where they had the giant bowling ball and they'd knock over all the people in the bowling pins?

404
00:35:40,921 --> 00:35:42,242
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what we were going to do with children.

405
00:35:44,143 --> 00:35:46,025
[SPEAKER_17]: No, it is actually going to be the legit bowling alley.

406
00:35:46,766 --> 00:35:48,047
[SPEAKER_17]: And what will it be, DDR Extreme?

407
00:35:48,808 --> 00:35:50,049
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, it's on an extreme machine.

408
00:35:50,069 --> 00:35:50,429
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

409
00:35:51,178 --> 00:35:53,481
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm working out details and I just got to get people together.

410
00:35:54,462 --> 00:35:59,347
[SPEAKER_17]: We should see if there's room to do some type of TV thing and bring in a home version of something.

411
00:35:59,627 --> 00:36:01,910
[SPEAKER_17]: I want to have like an amplitude tournament.

412
00:36:03,011 --> 00:36:03,391
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see.

413
00:36:03,471 --> 00:36:04,453
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see what works out.

414
00:36:04,833 --> 00:36:11,120
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, I'm not going to have much time to work on it at the end of the month because, of course, I'm doing that whole getting married thing, so...

415
00:36:11,974 --> 00:36:12,875
[SPEAKER_17]: MC Groove Dance Craze Miss Attack

416
00:36:39,761 --> 00:36:40,842
[SPEAKER_17]: What does Shaft stand for again?

417
00:36:41,823 --> 00:36:45,125
[SPEAKER_08]: Sactamani, which is sort of defunct, but eh.

418
00:36:45,905 --> 00:36:48,747
[SPEAKER_08]: Sactamani hosts another fabulous tournament.

419
00:36:48,767 --> 00:36:49,868
[SPEAKER_17]: Another fucking tournament.

420
00:36:49,888 --> 00:36:51,409
[SPEAKER_17]: You almost said another fucking tournament.

421
00:36:51,449 --> 00:36:52,570
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what it came from.

422
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:55,312
[SPEAKER_17]: So it'll be Sacramento hosts another fucking tournament, basically.

423
00:36:55,492 --> 00:37:00,596
[SPEAKER_08]: But for the sake of the lovely management at Fireside Lanes, it's fabulous.

424
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:01,397
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, sorry.

425
00:37:01,997 --> 00:37:03,298
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's always fabulous.

426
00:37:03,838 --> 00:37:06,480
[SPEAKER_08]: How about frickin' or... Because it's got me in charge of the whole thing.

427
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:08,902
[SPEAKER_18]: How about Sacramento hosts another Fireside Tournament?

428
00:37:09,457 --> 00:37:10,998
[SPEAKER_08]: because we haven't done one before.

429
00:37:11,899 --> 00:37:12,719
[SPEAKER_17]: That doesn't work.

430
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,662
[SPEAKER_08]: Host an awesome fireside tournament.

431
00:37:16,122 --> 00:37:16,342
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

432
00:37:17,323 --> 00:37:21,366
[SPEAKER_17]: I will see what I can do about buttering, because the chat room seems to be liking this idea of like an amplitude tournament.

433
00:37:21,666 --> 00:37:29,332
[SPEAKER_17]: So I will see what I can do about buttering up the one and only DarkSakura to let us do like not only an amplitude tournament, but some really horrible video game tournament.

434
00:37:29,392 --> 00:37:30,993
[SPEAKER_08]: I also may be coming into a copy of Rez.

435
00:37:32,294 --> 00:37:32,694
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, cool.

436
00:37:33,195 --> 00:37:34,215
[SPEAKER_08]: So maybe Rez tournament.

437
00:37:34,436 --> 00:37:34,816
[SPEAKER_17]: Or something.

438
00:37:34,956 --> 00:37:36,137
[SPEAKER_17]: Can you really do a tournament on Rez?

439
00:37:37,487 --> 00:37:40,349
[SPEAKER_17]: I will be hosting an unofficial Meteos tournament, so bring your DS.

440
00:37:40,829 --> 00:37:41,190
[SPEAKER_17]: It's on.

441
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:43,491
[SPEAKER_17]: Unofficial Meteos tournament.

442
00:37:44,431 --> 00:37:46,653
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway, more details on that come November.

443
00:37:49,014 --> 00:37:52,416
[SPEAKER_17]: Actually, no, we won't give you the details in November, or else you won't have time to plan.

444
00:37:52,456 --> 00:37:54,337
[SPEAKER_17]: More details to come, like, soon.

445
00:37:54,577 --> 00:37:57,899
[SPEAKER_08]: And we would love for people to come from all over to support this.

446
00:37:58,019 --> 00:37:58,559
[SPEAKER_17]: Absolutely.

447
00:37:58,819 --> 00:37:59,780
[SPEAKER_17]: Later than now.

448
00:38:00,798 --> 00:38:01,559
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, later than now.

449
00:38:01,859 --> 00:38:02,099
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway.

450
00:38:02,199 --> 00:38:04,240
[SPEAKER_08]: People can crash in my playroom.

451
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,501
[SPEAKER_08]: Back to the East Coast Tournament.

452
00:38:05,661 --> 00:38:08,162
[SPEAKER_17]: I didn't finish my story on the East Coast Tournament.

453
00:38:08,182 --> 00:38:08,742
[SPEAKER_17]: Why?

454
00:38:08,782 --> 00:38:09,623
[SPEAKER_17]: Actually, no, it's all right.

455
00:38:09,763 --> 00:38:10,343
[SPEAKER_17]: I cut you off.

456
00:38:10,363 --> 00:38:11,004
[SPEAKER_17]: You can cut me off.

457
00:38:11,044 --> 00:38:11,404
[SPEAKER_17]: It's fine.

458
00:38:12,544 --> 00:38:14,145
[SPEAKER_17]: It's because we love each other.

459
00:38:15,786 --> 00:38:17,887
[SPEAKER_17]: DarkSakura has this look of disgust on her face.

460
00:38:18,147 --> 00:38:18,408
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

461
00:38:19,008 --> 00:38:19,668
[SPEAKER_08]: No, that's okay.

462
00:38:20,929 --> 00:38:25,771
[SPEAKER_08]: I just saw Bush intent on change on my Yahoo, so I was like, that was the look of disgust.

463
00:38:25,791 --> 00:38:26,532
[SPEAKER_17]: You just saw Bush?

464
00:38:26,552 --> 00:38:26,632
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

465
00:38:27,481 --> 00:38:28,861
[SPEAKER_08]: Bush intent on change.

466
00:38:28,961 --> 00:38:30,622
[SPEAKER_08]: Social Security turns 70.

467
00:38:31,522 --> 00:38:32,082
[SPEAKER_08]: Butthead!

468
00:38:32,742 --> 00:38:33,002
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway.

469
00:38:33,843 --> 00:38:34,443
[SPEAKER_08]: He's not Bush.

470
00:38:35,103 --> 00:38:36,103
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway.

471
00:38:37,584 --> 00:38:37,944
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

472
00:38:38,844 --> 00:38:39,084
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

473
00:38:40,244 --> 00:38:41,765
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry, I've been gone for a couple weeks.

474
00:38:41,825 --> 00:38:42,445
[SPEAKER_17]: Everything's funny.

475
00:38:43,665 --> 00:38:44,305
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh yeah, the tournament.

476
00:38:44,345 --> 00:38:46,506
[SPEAKER_17]: I only ended up staying at this tournament for like 20 minutes.

477
00:38:46,906 --> 00:38:47,386
[SPEAKER_17]: Because I just...

478
00:38:49,389 --> 00:39:00,696
[SPEAKER_17]: I wasn't competing, and I was just kind of watching and observing, and I didn't know who to root for, because I didn't know any of these people, and I felt really bad, but also I just had other stuff going on, so I just ended up leaving after like 20 minutes.

479
00:39:01,036 --> 00:39:04,258
[SPEAKER_17]: Except I left with one of our listeners, so that was a cool thing.

480
00:39:04,418 --> 00:39:06,339
[SPEAKER_17]: One of our listeners, Ranchan,

481
00:39:06,639 --> 00:39:07,280
[SPEAKER_17]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

482
00:39:30,783 --> 00:39:37,327
[SPEAKER_17]: And so, of course, we were all excited because we were going to play DDR on the IMAX TV, as I'm calling it, because it's a fucking huge TV.

483
00:39:38,267 --> 00:39:41,629
[SPEAKER_17]: And then, lo and behold, your PlayStation 2 wouldn't load anything.

484
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:45,912
[SPEAKER_17]: We finally got DDR Extreme USA to work after a little bit, but...

485
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:51,391
[SPEAKER_17]: No background movies and you had to wait like two minutes for the song to load.

486
00:39:51,672 --> 00:39:53,272
[SPEAKER_17]: That poor thing was busted.

487
00:39:54,013 --> 00:39:56,914
[SPEAKER_17]: I didn't even get a chance to play because the damn thing broke before, but it's alright.

488
00:39:56,954 --> 00:39:57,375
[SPEAKER_17]: I had fun.

489
00:39:57,655 --> 00:39:58,956
[SPEAKER_17]: I had fun just being around strangers.

490
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:00,456
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't like to wear out my disk drive.

491
00:40:00,476 --> 00:40:01,577
[SPEAKER_17]: That's why I use my hard drive.

492
00:40:04,919 --> 00:40:11,602
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I find ironic is all these people complain about their disk drive not working and it going off the thing.

493
00:40:12,303 --> 00:40:14,544
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a first model JPS2 that's never had a problem.

494
00:40:17,445 --> 00:40:30,559
[SPEAKER_08]: and on top of that the whole reason that the component cable didn't work when we were trying to play Katamari at my house was because we didn't have the visual settings set up for component oh yeah I found that out too the first time I tried to do component is that it wasn't set up right anyway

495
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:39,375
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway, so yeah, we were playing Extreme for a little bit, and then we just kind of just hung out, went to a diner and ate, and then left, went our separate ways.

496
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:46,879
[SPEAKER_17]: And I went back to the tournament because I thought, okay, the tournament should be over by now, and I'll have a chance to play in the group too, so I can finally, you know, let Loki know how great it is.

497
00:40:48,744 --> 00:40:53,568
[SPEAKER_17]: And lo and behold, when I got back, the tournament was still going on, and it looked like it was still Perfect Attack.

498
00:40:53,869 --> 00:41:01,855
[SPEAKER_17]: I think actually what I missed in the morning, they were doing like an exhibition, they were setting up for freestyle, but I missed the actual competition itself.

499
00:41:02,136 --> 00:41:04,658
[SPEAKER_17]: And it still smelled like armpit when I got back.

500
00:41:05,659 --> 00:41:06,239
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry to say.

501
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:11,063
[SPEAKER_17]: But again, I'm not trying to pick on East Coast, because it's the same thing on the West Coast.

502
00:41:11,544 --> 00:41:13,606
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not trying to make a Jersey reference.

503
00:41:13,646 --> 00:41:14,046
[SPEAKER_17]: Shut up!

504
00:41:17,708 --> 00:41:20,829
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, you know why they built the Statue of Liberty facing the way it does?

505
00:41:21,269 --> 00:41:22,669
[SPEAKER_17]: It's ass-facing New Jersey.

506
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:28,451
[SPEAKER_17]: No, actually, everybody bashes on New Jersey, but I rather liked it in New Jersey.

507
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:30,352
[SPEAKER_17]: I thought New Jersey was a nice place.

508
00:41:30,472 --> 00:41:40,495
[SPEAKER_17]: I like New Jersey because that's where Jay and Silent Bob and Kevin Smith and all... Well, I went to Red Bank my last trip to Jersey, so this time I just kind of hung out in Dunnell and a little while longer.

509
00:41:41,115 --> 00:41:42,475
[SPEAKER_17]: I actually kind of like Jersey.

510
00:41:42,535 --> 00:41:47,437
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know why people knock on it, but from what I understand about Jersey, it's the big cities that suck.

511
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:52,614
[SPEAKER_17]: and the other big cities in New Jersey that are no fun.

512
00:41:52,915 --> 00:41:54,417
[SPEAKER_17]: But I had a good time.

513
00:41:55,618 --> 00:41:56,739
[SPEAKER_17]: You know what else?

514
00:41:56,819 --> 00:42:01,105
[SPEAKER_17]: I actually went into New York City on Saturday and just walked around aimlessly for forever.

515
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:02,246
[SPEAKER_17]: We just walked around

516
00:42:02,981 --> 00:42:04,942
[SPEAKER_17]: We walked around the Chelsea District, wink wink.

517
00:42:05,242 --> 00:42:09,123
[SPEAKER_17]: We walked around the area around Grand Central Station.

518
00:42:09,183 --> 00:42:10,964
[SPEAKER_17]: We walked around Union Square.

519
00:42:11,244 --> 00:42:12,304
[SPEAKER_17]: We walked around Times Square.

520
00:42:12,324 --> 00:42:13,565
[SPEAKER_17]: We just walked forever and ever.

521
00:42:14,305 --> 00:42:17,506
[SPEAKER_17]: Didn't get a chance to play any DDR in New York City, but I loved New York City.

522
00:42:17,526 --> 00:42:18,347
[SPEAKER_17]: I had a great time.

523
00:42:18,487 --> 00:42:20,928
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm totally thinking like, I should just move here.

524
00:42:23,048 --> 00:42:23,929
[SPEAKER_17]: But I know I won't.

525
00:42:23,969 --> 00:42:26,650
[SPEAKER_17]: That's just the afterglow of a trip, you know.

526
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:29,991
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been once and have not been inclined to go back for a long time.

527
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:30,951
[SPEAKER_08]: This was 11 years ago.

528
00:42:33,581 --> 00:42:34,922
[SPEAKER_17]: The first time I went I was 17.

529
00:42:35,884 --> 00:42:37,285
[SPEAKER_17]: But everything was too organized.

530
00:42:37,486 --> 00:42:40,450
[SPEAKER_17]: It was nice to go back and not have a plan and get to walk around just like everywhere.

531
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:41,050
[SPEAKER_17]: It was great.

532
00:42:41,311 --> 00:42:41,932
[SPEAKER_17]: I had a really good time.

533
00:42:41,972 --> 00:42:43,153
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I'd have a better time.

534
00:42:43,994 --> 00:42:46,838
[SPEAKER_08]: But honestly, I don't like looking up and seeing building.

535
00:42:47,719 --> 00:42:50,423
[SPEAKER_08]: I like looking up and seeing a tree and sky.

536
00:42:50,925 --> 00:42:53,005
[SPEAKER_08]: and breathing air that's not full of dirt.

537
00:42:53,305 --> 00:42:53,886
[SPEAKER_17]: It didn't bother me.

538
00:42:54,546 --> 00:42:55,326
[SPEAKER_17]: But this is the weird thing.

539
00:42:55,526 --> 00:42:58,966
[SPEAKER_17]: I hate San Francisco for that exact reason you're mentioning.

540
00:42:59,387 --> 00:43:00,927
[SPEAKER_17]: New York City, I loved.

541
00:43:01,267 --> 00:43:01,907
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know why.

542
00:43:02,487 --> 00:43:04,367
[SPEAKER_17]: No, I do know why, actually.

543
00:43:04,387 --> 00:43:04,948
[SPEAKER_17]: It was the people.

544
00:43:05,168 --> 00:43:07,808
[SPEAKER_17]: There was a lot of just neat-looking people and neat-looking things.

545
00:43:08,588 --> 00:43:13,069
[SPEAKER_17]: I went to the Toys R Us in Times Square, which was awesome.

546
00:43:13,449 --> 00:43:14,509
[SPEAKER_17]: The Toys R Us in Times Square.

547
00:43:14,529 --> 00:43:16,090
[SPEAKER_17]: I've never been to such a cool-looking Toys R Us.

548
00:43:16,370 --> 00:43:17,050
[SPEAKER_17]: Did you eat at Roxy's?

549
00:43:18,564 --> 00:43:20,245
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

550
00:43:37,654 --> 00:43:38,695
[SPEAKER_17]: It was so cool.

551
00:43:38,715 --> 00:43:40,376
[SPEAKER_17]: They had demos for all these upcoming games.

552
00:43:40,396 --> 00:43:42,058
[SPEAKER_17]: It was almost like going to E3.

553
00:43:42,078 --> 00:43:44,480
[SPEAKER_17]: They had the Nintendogs demo, and they had a bunch of other demos.

554
00:43:45,181 --> 00:43:50,325
[SPEAKER_17]: I didn't realize the Nintendogs demo was everywhere at this point in a lot of stores, because I saw it at Best Buy the other day.

555
00:43:50,685 --> 00:43:54,909
[SPEAKER_17]: But I loved the setup there, and it was not an overpriced Toys R Us.

556
00:43:54,929 --> 00:44:01,254
[SPEAKER_17]: You would think that the Times Square would have overpriced games, but it was pretty much the same thing they'd charge in any mall or anything.

557
00:44:01,575 --> 00:44:02,355
[SPEAKER_17]: So I had a really good time.

558
00:44:02,495 --> 00:44:04,157
[SPEAKER_17]: I do want to go back and spend more time in the city.

559
00:44:04,837 --> 00:44:06,900
[SPEAKER_17]: Moving there, I think that's just kind of a joke.

560
00:44:07,161 --> 00:44:10,486
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think I would actually... That would be highly unrealistic because it's expensive.

561
00:44:10,626 --> 00:44:11,727
[SPEAKER_17]: It's expensive to live there.

562
00:44:12,268 --> 00:44:12,689
[SPEAKER_14]: So we'll see.

563
00:44:14,712 --> 00:44:14,952
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway...

564
00:44:17,396 --> 00:44:19,558
[SPEAKER_17]: So I guess that's about it.

565
00:44:19,958 --> 00:44:20,379
[SPEAKER_17]: You know what?

566
00:44:20,419 --> 00:44:20,959
[SPEAKER_17]: You know what's funny?

567
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:26,285
[SPEAKER_17]: Somebody in our chat room, Sephiroth1215 actually said, brought up the Chinatown in the Groove 2 machine.

568
00:44:26,705 --> 00:44:31,670
[SPEAKER_17]: I found out about that after I left New York City because DJ Ranma S told me about it.

569
00:44:31,690 --> 00:44:33,612
[SPEAKER_17]: It was showing me pictures of the machine.

570
00:44:34,333 --> 00:44:35,334
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm kind of sad.

571
00:44:35,394 --> 00:44:37,716
[SPEAKER_17]: I could have gone to Chinatown and actually played in the Groove 2.

572
00:44:37,996 --> 00:44:39,638
[SPEAKER_17]: But my friend who I was with,

573
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:40,703
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for watching!

574
00:44:55,731 --> 00:44:56,232
[SPEAKER_17]: Caution, Dr. Dick

575
00:45:13,454 --> 00:45:15,335
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I should just go in Dr. Dick Garb or something.

576
00:45:15,575 --> 00:45:19,197
[SPEAKER_17]: But seriously, this time I dressed, I just blended in, I was just another kid at the thing.

577
00:45:19,277 --> 00:45:21,839
[SPEAKER_17]: Although, really, I'm probably the oldest person that was there.

578
00:45:22,299 --> 00:45:32,105
[SPEAKER_17]: But, you know, I swear next time I go I'll... But I have some time off around the Labor Day, but there's too much going on around that time where I might not be able to go.

579
00:45:32,685 --> 00:45:33,065
[SPEAKER_17]: So we'll see.

580
00:45:33,846 --> 00:45:34,106
We'll see.

581
00:45:34,403 --> 00:45:35,824
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, because someone you know is getting married.

582
00:45:36,104 --> 00:45:39,427
[SPEAKER_17]: I do, but I need to find out when the reception is because I can plan around it.

583
00:45:40,248 --> 00:45:41,769
[SPEAKER_17]: The next weekend.

584
00:45:43,511 --> 00:45:46,833
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway, let's go to a break.

585
00:45:47,034 --> 00:45:52,598
[SPEAKER_17]: Now see everybody on the East Coast is telling me all these in the group 2 machines I could have gone to play.

586
00:45:53,039 --> 00:45:53,639
[SPEAKER_17]: Thanks guys.

587
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:55,941
[SPEAKER_17]: This is good to find out about after the fact.

588
00:45:56,241 --> 00:45:57,943
[SPEAKER_17]: Now somebody's saying you should have gone to Coney Island.

589
00:46:01,721 --> 00:46:02,602
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, let's go to a break.

590
00:46:02,642 --> 00:46:05,985
[SPEAKER_17]: In this break, we're going to hear some requests from the chat room.

591
00:46:06,645 --> 00:46:08,747
[SPEAKER_17]: And when we come back, we're going to talk about DDR with Fire.

592
00:46:09,308 --> 00:46:11,770
[SPEAKER_17]: And we're going to talk about some other things that have been going on in the DDR scene.

593
00:46:12,130 --> 00:46:14,092
[SPEAKER_17]: And we'll talk about whatever else we feel like talking about.

594
00:46:14,492 --> 00:46:15,353
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll be back after this.

595
00:46:15,613 --> 00:46:17,094
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to start it off with a request.

596
00:46:17,154 --> 00:46:20,337
[SPEAKER_17]: We actually had a couple In The Groove song requests, so we'll get those out of the way.

597
00:46:21,098 --> 00:46:24,260
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, this is good too because we want to hear about Loki's experience with In The Groove.

598
00:46:24,581 --> 00:46:25,982
[SPEAKER_17]: Because you teased something a while back.

599
00:46:26,002 --> 00:46:27,063
[SPEAKER_17]: What did you tease the listeners with?

600
00:46:27,083 --> 00:46:29,505
[SPEAKER_17]: That you were going to rent it or that you rented it but hadn't played it?

601
00:46:30,579 --> 00:46:32,642
[SPEAKER_17]: I have it, and I've played it.

602
00:46:34,143 --> 00:46:37,928
[SPEAKER_17]: And I was going to tell you my thoughts on it, and we're going to see if they've changed.

603
00:46:38,248 --> 00:46:39,610
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, that's the first thing I've ever read.

604
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:43,234
[SPEAKER_17]: Because it's very possible that they might have changed, and I could be an indie group lover.

605
00:46:44,035 --> 00:46:45,997
[SPEAKER_17]: And then again, angels could be real also, but...

606
00:46:47,057 --> 00:46:47,618
[SPEAKER_17]: You know what, though?

607
00:46:48,439 --> 00:46:52,925
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, you posted in your live journal something this week about an Apple product and that you liked it.

608
00:46:53,185 --> 00:46:54,387
[SPEAKER_17]: The G6 or something, right?

609
00:46:54,427 --> 00:46:54,687
[SPEAKER_17]: Wasn't it?

610
00:46:54,787 --> 00:46:55,108
[SPEAKER_17]: Or something?

611
00:46:55,468 --> 00:46:59,974
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, but did you... It was the Linux toaster.

612
00:47:00,074 --> 00:47:01,316
[SPEAKER_08]: It was the Linux toaster.

613
00:47:01,636 --> 00:47:02,618
[SPEAKER_17]: I was on dial-up.

614
00:47:02,658 --> 00:47:03,559
[SPEAKER_17]: I couldn't follow links.

615
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:33,958
[SPEAKER_17]: So wait, but there was something Apple related, you confessed to liking a lot There was two, there was two things I posted in my live journal There's one that said this, the only viable use for an Apple iPod And it was a story about a woman bludgeoning her boyfriend Which was fake With an iPod, okay If you look it was on the rumor mill And then the second one was a picture of the Apple G6 And it was a Linux toaster Because we all know that the Apple has the processing power of a toaster I hate you

616
00:47:36,661 --> 00:47:37,822
[SPEAKER_17]: I was bored that day, okay?

617
00:47:37,982 --> 00:47:40,024
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll be back with Loki's thoughts on Indigree.

618
00:47:40,104 --> 00:47:43,408
[SPEAKER_17]: Honestly, I am sick and tired of this stupid Apple thing.

619
00:47:43,448 --> 00:47:45,710
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, granted, we know that I don't like them.

620
00:47:46,291 --> 00:47:48,994
[SPEAKER_17]: Do we really need to constantly bring this up that I don't like them?

621
00:47:49,014 --> 00:47:50,135
[SPEAKER_17]: Because it gets old.

622
00:47:50,896 --> 00:47:51,517
[SPEAKER_17]: Nope, doesn't get old.

623
00:47:51,537 --> 00:47:51,717
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

624
00:48:11,590 --> 00:48:13,131
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you see me falling high?

625
00:48:13,211 --> 00:48:16,734
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you hear me calling you?

626
00:48:17,054 --> 00:48:23,539
[SPEAKER_06]: Shadows of it pass by You're ready to fade and die We'll love you Forever

627
00:48:45,727 --> 00:48:47,188
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching!

628
00:49:17,403 --> 00:49:18,394
Can you see me?

629
00:50:14,592 --> 00:50:16,613
The Beat Is Real Swift It's Groovin'

630
00:50:42,967 --> 00:50:46,208
Maintain the game, the fame of what I see from Ramblin' Ramblin' down here

631
00:51:30,248 --> 00:51:30,908
Thanks for watching!

632
00:51:59,247 --> 00:51:59,808
Thanks for watching!

633
00:52:26,284 --> 00:52:28,505
Thanks for watching!

634
00:52:51,690 --> 00:52:52,370
Thanks for watching!

635
00:53:17,711 --> 00:53:31,353
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, do it all night, do it with me I'll take you to heaven if you make me feel free, babe Do it tonight, do it all right Just take me and shake me till I burn up inside, oh

636
00:53:46,421 --> 00:53:47,816
May, Haskell, Zaxxon, Salmon

637
00:54:41,886 --> 00:54:43,167
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on, do it with me.

638
00:54:57,639 --> 00:54:59,541
[SPEAKER_17]: We're back, boys and girls, here on Orange Launch Radio.

639
00:54:59,561 --> 00:55:04,865
[SPEAKER_17]: In that break, you heard some varying music there that was either inspired by chat or requested outright by chat.

640
00:55:05,525 --> 00:55:08,688
[SPEAKER_17]: Queen of Light there from In the Groove, A Minute from DDR Max 2.

641
00:55:09,088 --> 00:55:15,333
[SPEAKER_17]: And I know that Rini, who requested that song, actually wanted to hear the original, like, old-ass version.

642
00:55:15,353 --> 00:55:16,174
[SPEAKER_08]: It only takes a minute.

643
00:55:16,294 --> 00:55:17,375
[SPEAKER_17]: But I couldn't find it.

644
00:55:17,675 --> 00:55:23,480
[SPEAKER_17]: I could have sworn it was in that giant potpourri directory that I got from your computer, which I think in turn came from a Guana Girls computer.

645
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:26,282
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know why that would have been in there, since that's the original.

646
00:55:27,526 --> 00:55:27,887
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know.

647
00:55:28,168 --> 00:55:30,473
[SPEAKER_18]: Wasn't there one in like way old-ass DDR?

648
00:55:30,914 --> 00:55:31,074
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

649
00:55:31,655 --> 00:55:32,157
[SPEAKER_17]: I thought there was.

650
00:55:32,277 --> 00:55:33,339
[SPEAKER_08]: The original was never in DDR.

651
00:55:35,429 --> 00:55:35,890
[SPEAKER_17]: I thought it was.

652
00:55:35,910 --> 00:55:37,391
[SPEAKER_17]: I thought it was in like an old-ass mix of DDR.

653
00:55:37,671 --> 00:55:38,011
[SPEAKER_08]: No, never.

654
00:55:38,551 --> 00:55:40,432
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry, my memory's fading as I'm getting old.

655
00:55:41,133 --> 00:55:42,634
[SPEAKER_17]: Summer in Belize from In The Groove 2.

656
00:55:42,674 --> 00:55:44,835
[SPEAKER_17]: That was actually the first time I really listened to that song.

657
00:55:45,796 --> 00:55:46,436
[SPEAKER_17]: Not too shabby.

658
00:55:46,496 --> 00:55:46,936
[SPEAKER_17]: I like that one.

659
00:55:46,956 --> 00:55:47,457
[SPEAKER_17]: That was pretty cool.

660
00:55:48,077 --> 00:55:51,879
[SPEAKER_17]: Erotic from DDR3rd makes do it all night, because the chatroom was talking about Erotic.

661
00:55:52,199 --> 00:56:01,205
[SPEAKER_17]: Somebody actually asked what the Dr. Dick thing was all about, and even though I couldn't really play this song because it's a little bit longer, excuse me,

662
00:56:02,205 --> 00:56:11,249
[SPEAKER_17]: It was actually kind of inspired by an old erotic song called Help Me Dr. Dick, is where that monkey comes from, the Dr. Dick name.

663
00:56:11,669 --> 00:56:14,710
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's my improv freestyle alter ego.

664
00:56:14,730 --> 00:56:15,850
[SPEAKER_17]: Let me play a little clip of the song.

665
00:56:21,092 --> 00:56:25,014
[SPEAKER_06]: There we go.

666
00:56:25,034 --> 00:56:27,095
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's the song from Erotic, and that's where it came from.

667
00:56:28,035 --> 00:56:28,235
Anyway.

668
00:56:31,089 --> 00:56:34,530
[SPEAKER_17]: Charum is swearing up and down that that was in third mix.

669
00:56:34,570 --> 00:56:36,691
[SPEAKER_17]: Let me check my DDR for a minute.

670
00:56:36,771 --> 00:56:40,892
[SPEAKER_17]: I could swear that... I thought I'd played the original one in DDR before.

671
00:56:40,912 --> 00:56:41,752
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just been so long.

672
00:56:41,852 --> 00:56:43,253
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to be honest, kids.

673
00:56:43,293 --> 00:56:44,373
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not really one of my favorite songs.

674
00:56:44,393 --> 00:56:44,773
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll just check.

675
00:56:45,093 --> 00:56:46,473
[SPEAKER_08]: Step Mania doesn't count.

676
00:56:46,553 --> 00:56:47,354
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll check my home version.

677
00:56:47,874 --> 00:56:48,314
[SPEAKER_18]: Holy crap.

678
00:56:48,374 --> 00:56:48,634
[SPEAKER_18]: Here it is.

679
00:56:48,674 --> 00:56:48,834
[SPEAKER_18]: Wait.

680
00:56:48,854 --> 00:56:49,654
[SPEAKER_18]: I have the third mix soundtrack.

681
00:56:49,674 --> 00:56:50,034
[SPEAKER_18]: You got it?

682
00:56:50,095 --> 00:56:50,395
[SPEAKER_18]: Here it is.

683
00:56:53,415 --> 00:56:53,936
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

684
00:56:54,216 --> 00:56:54,696
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

685
00:56:55,076 --> 00:56:55,996
[SPEAKER_17]: See, you have to hear it.

686
00:56:56,156 --> 00:56:58,417
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to think of the... I was thinking of the...

687
00:57:00,313 --> 00:57:01,213
[SPEAKER_08]: and a different one by them.

688
00:57:04,395 --> 00:57:07,116
[SPEAKER_17]: It's one of those ones I just never freaking played because I didn't like the song.

689
00:57:07,316 --> 00:57:08,117
[SPEAKER_17]: I love this song.

690
00:57:08,517 --> 00:57:09,317
[SPEAKER_17]: I didn't like it.

691
00:57:09,357 --> 00:57:09,977
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry, kids.

692
00:57:10,638 --> 00:57:11,878
[SPEAKER_17]: It's one of those ones I always skipped.

693
00:57:13,659 --> 00:57:16,020
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, so we fucked up.

694
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:16,580
[SPEAKER_17]: Leave us alone.

695
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:18,341
[SPEAKER_17]: We're allowed to make a mistake once in a while.

696
00:57:19,161 --> 00:57:21,503
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, anyway, let's take a minute.

697
00:57:21,523 --> 00:57:24,864
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to have Loki's review now of In the Groove.

698
00:57:25,224 --> 00:57:29,166
[SPEAKER_17]: Loki, you were mentioning that you... Did you rent or you bought In the Groove?

699
00:57:31,159 --> 00:57:32,701
[SPEAKER_17]: or you acquired in the groove?

700
00:57:34,783 --> 00:57:36,464
[SPEAKER_17]: Let me just say I played in the groove.

701
00:57:36,484 --> 00:57:37,025
[SPEAKER_17]: How about that?

702
00:57:37,065 --> 00:57:37,845
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll leave it at that.

703
00:57:37,965 --> 00:57:38,306
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

704
00:57:38,346 --> 00:57:46,953
[SPEAKER_17]: Because I consider it a waste of... I'm going to use it as a waste... Basically say it's a waste of space on my hard drive.

705
00:57:47,294 --> 00:57:47,774
[SPEAKER_17]: But anyways...

706
00:57:48,985 --> 00:57:56,530
[SPEAKER_17]: So yes, I played in the groove, I booted it up, tried it, you know, said, okay, what's the big deal about this game?

707
00:57:56,610 --> 00:57:59,352
[SPEAKER_17]: Played it for a good, you know, a good half an hour.

708
00:57:59,793 --> 00:58:01,674
[SPEAKER_17]: I definitely gave it a couple songs a try.

709
00:58:03,635 --> 00:58:05,817
[SPEAKER_17]: My opinion of this game has not changed one bit.

710
00:58:06,477 --> 00:58:07,558
[SPEAKER_17]: It still sucks ass.

711
00:58:07,678 --> 00:58:10,120
[SPEAKER_17]: And now I've played it, I can say it sucks ass.

712
00:58:10,580 --> 00:58:16,745
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, and I'm still debating on buying an actual copy of the game so I can write this game sucks ass so we can give it away, but...

713
00:58:18,112 --> 00:58:20,435
[SPEAKER_17]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

714
00:58:35,748 --> 00:58:37,228
[SPEAKER_17]: What kind of songs did you play when you played it?

715
00:58:37,569 --> 00:58:39,709
[SPEAKER_17]: Were there any catchy songs you liked at all?

716
00:58:39,989 --> 00:58:42,590
[SPEAKER_17]: I honestly, I can't even, they're forgettable.

717
00:58:42,650 --> 00:58:43,970
[SPEAKER_17]: That's how bad this game is.

718
00:58:44,430 --> 00:58:47,711
[SPEAKER_17]: I played a few things, I was just kind of going down the list.

719
00:58:47,891 --> 00:58:49,852
[SPEAKER_17]: And I don't remember what songs I played and when I played them.

720
00:58:50,352 --> 00:58:55,274
[SPEAKER_17]: But the step charts to me seemed like something I saw like on Bomani's style in their sim file section.

721
00:58:55,294 --> 00:58:57,174
[SPEAKER_17]: Like some idiot, just any idiot made them up.

722
00:58:57,574 --> 00:58:58,594
[SPEAKER_17]: They weren't that great.

723
00:58:58,835 --> 00:59:01,355
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, and I was playing it on the most difficult settings.

724
00:59:01,415 --> 00:59:03,896
[SPEAKER_17]: So I was just, you know, okay, expecting something really cool.

725
00:59:04,913 --> 00:59:06,335
[SPEAKER_17]: No, I never got it.

726
00:59:06,615 --> 00:59:10,399
[SPEAKER_17]: And, okay, wow, there's so many modifiers, does nothing for me.

727
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:14,644
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, that's just like saying, ooh, look, you know, cereal comes in multiple colors.

728
00:59:14,804 --> 00:59:15,845
[SPEAKER_17]: Doesn't matter to me, I mean.

729
00:59:16,165 --> 00:59:18,528
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, to play devil's advocate here a little bit.

730
00:59:18,768 --> 00:59:19,049
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

731
00:59:19,109 --> 00:59:21,211
[SPEAKER_17]: What's so freaking great about DDR home releases, then?

732
00:59:22,771 --> 00:59:31,778
[SPEAKER_17]: The music, for one, all their music in the groove sounded like some just amateurish, very, very amateur sounding music.

733
00:59:32,739 --> 00:59:34,681
[SPEAKER_17]: Granted, the license stuff was okay.

734
00:59:35,041 --> 00:59:37,183
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, it was okay, but it wasn't standout.

735
00:59:37,283 --> 00:59:39,204
[SPEAKER_17]: It was just, I mean, it's forgettable.

736
00:59:39,444 --> 00:59:40,986
[SPEAKER_17]: The entire game is forgettable.

737
00:59:41,126 --> 00:59:43,047
[SPEAKER_17]: That's pretty much what it comes down to.

738
00:59:43,688 --> 00:59:44,809
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, you think that

739
00:59:46,161 --> 00:59:50,805
[SPEAKER_17]: I would be ranting and raving about this game, but even the Unlocked songs were just whoop-a-dee-doo.

740
00:59:51,005 --> 00:59:52,206
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, it wasn't that great.

741
00:59:52,686 --> 00:59:55,889
[SPEAKER_17]: And I saw the preview songs for In the Groove 2 on there.

742
00:59:56,569 --> 00:59:56,950
[SPEAKER_17]: Wow!

743
00:59:57,750 --> 01:00:00,733
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm glad to see that they've sure not stepped up.

744
01:00:01,653 --> 01:00:09,240
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, it's interesting you didn't even like the Unlocked, because I would say probably my favorite In the Groove song with, I think, some of the most fun steps is one of the Unlocks, Anubis.

745
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:14,624
[SPEAKER_17]: I know that song's horrid, sorry guys, but I think it's like the most fun...

746
01:00:15,843 --> 01:00:16,604
[SPEAKER_17]: Thanks for watching!

747
01:00:34,257 --> 01:00:38,119
[SPEAKER_17]: I've knocked on this game enough, let me see what it is, because maybe I could be wrong about it.

748
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:40,941
[SPEAKER_17]: But I'm afraid I was not wrong about it.

749
01:00:41,021 --> 01:00:41,942
[SPEAKER_17]: It sucks.

750
01:00:42,622 --> 01:00:43,663
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a crappy game.

751
01:00:44,003 --> 01:00:45,063
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what it comes down to.

752
01:00:45,704 --> 01:00:46,804
[SPEAKER_17]: It's another music game.

753
01:00:46,924 --> 01:00:50,026
[SPEAKER_17]: Granted, if you're really starving for music games, go play it.

754
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:53,748
[SPEAKER_17]: But I'm not starving for music games, so I'm not going to play it.

755
01:00:54,008 --> 01:00:55,149
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what it's going to come down to.

756
01:00:55,169 --> 01:00:56,870
[SPEAKER_17]: I just didn't like it.

757
01:00:57,932 --> 01:01:02,255
[SPEAKER_17]: To me, the whole game seemed like, you know, it seemed very, very amateur.

758
01:01:02,395 --> 01:01:09,500
[SPEAKER_17]: It seemed like just some guy made some homebrew stuff, got some company to publish it for him, and boom, there's the game.

759
01:01:10,180 --> 01:01:11,441
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, that's pretty much what happened anyway.

760
01:01:11,461 --> 01:01:13,243
[SPEAKER_17]: I was going to say, that's kind of what happened anyway.

761
01:01:13,723 --> 01:01:16,485
[SPEAKER_17]: But there's just not the polish in there.

762
01:01:16,705 --> 01:01:24,050
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just that, and even in the group too, there's not... You're not going to give them a break on the polish thing considering it's their first mix they've ever done.

763
01:01:24,130 --> 01:01:25,831
[SPEAKER_17]: Red Octane's first game they published.

764
01:01:26,192 --> 01:01:26,712
[SPEAKER_17]: Rockstar's

765
01:01:27,423 --> 01:01:27,783
[SPEAKER_17]: DarkSakura,

766
01:01:49,555 --> 01:01:56,637
[SPEAKER_17]: You know what, as much as I'm trying to play devil's advocate for In the Groove here because I do think the game's alright, the characters thing is kind of, yeah, lame.

767
01:01:57,438 --> 01:02:07,461
[SPEAKER_17]: But In the Groove 2 and In the Groove 1 really feels to me, just from Observer, remember I haven't played the game yet so I'm not going to give a full review on the game until I actually play it.

768
01:02:07,861 --> 01:02:12,363
[SPEAKER_17]: But from a glance, from looking at it, it doesn't look any different from Max 2 to Max 1.

769
01:02:12,523 --> 01:02:15,244
[SPEAKER_17]: And let's not forget Max 2 was actually a real improvement over Max 1.

770
01:02:15,684 --> 01:02:16,224
[SPEAKER_17]: But what did they do?

771
01:02:16,244 --> 01:02:17,264
[SPEAKER_17]: They changed the interface to Reb.

772
01:02:17,425 --> 01:02:18,005
[SPEAKER_17]: Whoopee shit!

773
01:02:18,045 --> 01:02:18,765
[SPEAKER_17]: And added some songs.

774
01:02:19,025 --> 01:02:22,766
[SPEAKER_17]: But the game itself was... Well, they also added non-stops and stuff, I think.

775
01:02:22,967 --> 01:02:23,507
[SPEAKER_17]: Or Oni.

776
01:02:23,627 --> 01:02:25,688
[SPEAKER_17]: Was it Oni and... Marathons and In the Groove?

777
01:02:26,148 --> 01:02:27,068
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, they had that on the next show.

778
01:02:27,088 --> 01:02:27,668
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know.

779
01:02:28,229 --> 01:02:28,709
[SPEAKER_17]: Whatever.

780
01:02:28,789 --> 01:02:30,589
[SPEAKER_17]: But still, though, I mean, come on now.

781
01:02:31,050 --> 01:02:32,630
[SPEAKER_17]: It's... I don't know.

782
01:02:33,010 --> 01:02:34,951
[SPEAKER_17]: I even... It's just, it wasn't for me.

783
01:02:36,552 --> 01:02:41,274
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, boys and girls, if you disagree with Loki, we will give you a chance to... Well, you know, so what?

784
01:02:41,314 --> 01:02:42,534
[SPEAKER_16]: You disagree, big deal.

785
01:02:42,574 --> 01:02:44,055
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, I gave it a shot.

786
01:02:44,115 --> 01:02:46,075
[SPEAKER_17]: It wasn't like, you know, I'm talking about nothing here.

787
01:02:46,215 --> 01:02:47,556
[SPEAKER_17]: I actually played the game, so...

788
01:02:48,904 --> 01:02:49,664
[SPEAKER_17]: What are you going to say?

789
01:02:49,865 --> 01:02:50,965
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, so you don't like it.

790
01:02:51,005 --> 01:02:51,505
[SPEAKER_17]: You're wrong.

791
01:02:51,605 --> 01:02:53,286
[SPEAKER_17]: No, actually, it's my opinion, so I'm right.

792
01:02:55,146 --> 01:02:57,467
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just, you know, it's just not a very good game.

793
01:02:57,487 --> 01:02:59,748
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, whatever.

794
01:02:59,888 --> 01:03:02,169
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, I don't like Pump It Up either that much.

795
01:03:02,649 --> 01:03:07,571
[SPEAKER_17]: Granted, that game is better than In The Groove because they've put more polish into the game.

796
01:03:07,611 --> 01:03:09,792
[SPEAKER_17]: Granted, I think the crazy mode is retarded, but

797
01:03:10,202 --> 01:03:15,004
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, the dance sequences are fun, and the music is okay.

798
01:03:15,084 --> 01:03:15,604
[SPEAKER_17]: It's different.

799
01:03:16,544 --> 01:03:21,546
[SPEAKER_17]: And, I don't know, the background movies are actually good, whereas In the Groove is kind of plain.

800
01:03:21,946 --> 01:03:28,009
[SPEAKER_17]: But, you know, I will actually go on the record saying, and keep in mind I haven't played many Pump It Up games in the arcade.

801
01:03:28,049 --> 01:03:29,929
[SPEAKER_17]: I've played a various amount.

802
01:03:30,810 --> 01:03:32,410
[SPEAKER_17]: I actually think In the Groove is better than Pump It Up.

803
01:03:34,071 --> 01:03:37,112
[SPEAKER_17]: I hate Pump It Up's interface with a passion.

804
01:03:37,953 --> 01:03:38,474
[SPEAKER_17]: I hate it.

805
01:03:38,614 --> 01:03:40,275
[SPEAKER_17]: It ruins almost the whole damn game for me.

806
01:03:40,295 --> 01:03:41,916
[SPEAKER_17]: And to be honest, the music is kind of hit and miss.

807
01:03:42,096 --> 01:03:46,620
[SPEAKER_17]: There's some great songs in Pump It Up, but a few more misses than hits for me.

808
01:03:47,221 --> 01:03:48,301
[SPEAKER_17]: I can't play the same six songs.

809
01:03:48,341 --> 01:03:48,662
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

810
01:03:48,682 --> 01:03:51,604
[SPEAKER_17]: I can play In The Groove a little bit longer, I guess, to see if my opinion changes.

811
01:03:51,624 --> 01:03:52,605
[SPEAKER_17]: Your opinion won't change.

812
01:03:54,847 --> 01:03:57,729
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe In The Groove 2 is this godly game.

813
01:03:57,829 --> 01:03:59,190
[SPEAKER_17]: Now maybe In The Groove 2 is a little better.

814
01:03:59,210 --> 01:03:59,550
[SPEAKER_17]: You'll see.

815
01:03:59,771 --> 01:04:00,091
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll see.

816
01:04:01,312 --> 01:04:02,052
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think so.

817
01:04:03,153 --> 01:04:06,416
[SPEAKER_17]: That's like saying maybe McDonald's brand new stuff tastes good.

818
01:04:07,054 --> 01:04:08,475
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe it's going to be real meat this time.

819
01:04:09,055 --> 01:04:09,216
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

820
01:04:10,957 --> 01:04:15,440
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, well, chat room, if you want to respond to that, we will open up the Skype line a little later.

821
01:04:17,121 --> 01:04:19,922
[SPEAKER_17]: There's not going to be anything you're going to say that's going to change Loki's mind.

822
01:04:19,942 --> 01:04:22,044
[SPEAKER_17]: I do have something, though, that we've got to try.

823
01:04:22,204 --> 01:04:24,025
[SPEAKER_17]: I meant to get here earlier today.

824
01:04:25,786 --> 01:04:28,088
[SPEAKER_17]: I have acquired a copy of SingStar.

825
01:04:28,828 --> 01:04:29,509
[SPEAKER_17]: What the hell is that?

826
01:04:29,789 --> 01:04:31,510
[SPEAKER_17]: The European karaoke game.

827
01:04:32,042 --> 01:04:33,983
[SPEAKER_17]: SingStar Popstar

828
01:05:01,607 --> 01:05:05,350
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, ThinkStarPop is... Okay, so maybe they altered the name a little bit.

829
01:05:05,450 --> 01:05:07,171
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, so you got a chance to check this out.

830
01:05:07,371 --> 01:05:11,634
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I haven't got to play it yet, but I meant to bring it over today.

831
01:05:12,675 --> 01:05:14,657
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, we'll have to check it out next week.

832
01:05:14,677 --> 01:05:16,478
[SPEAKER_17]: Just like you were going to bring Taiko no Tachigen for PS3.

833
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:18,521
[SPEAKER_17]: I was running out the door, literally.

834
01:05:18,541 --> 01:05:19,661
[SPEAKER_17]: I was like, what time is it?

835
01:05:19,741 --> 01:05:20,542
[SPEAKER_17]: Ah, shit, I'm going to be late.

836
01:05:20,822 --> 01:05:21,442
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, alright.

837
01:05:32,988 --> 01:05:38,991
[SPEAKER_17]: It's actually something that the creators of the game, or I think it was the distributors of the game, actually emailed us about a while back.

838
01:05:39,351 --> 01:05:42,953
[SPEAKER_17]: And we've kind of refrained from talking about it because there has been a lot of information on it.

839
01:05:43,894 --> 01:05:45,174
[SPEAKER_17]: But I actually got a chance to play this game.

840
01:05:45,214 --> 01:05:50,157
[SPEAKER_17]: And imagine if Taiko no Tachigen and Drum Mania had a baby.

841
01:05:51,057 --> 01:05:55,760
[SPEAKER_17]: It would be this game called Percussion Master, which is what I got a chance to play over at 8 on the Break.

842
01:05:57,265 --> 01:05:59,607
[SPEAKER_17]: I actually kind of enjoyed Percussion Master.

843
01:05:59,667 --> 01:06:08,495
[SPEAKER_17]: When I first was kind of looking at the release that the guy had sent us and stuff, and the fact that there wasn't a whole lot of information, I was kind of thinking, eh, I don't know about this game.

844
01:06:08,595 --> 01:06:10,757
[SPEAKER_17]: It kind of looks like it's going to be a little cheese bit of a ripoff.

845
01:06:11,078 --> 01:06:14,561
[SPEAKER_17]: But what makes this game good is that they actually have a pretty solid song list.

846
01:06:14,861 --> 01:06:19,783
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, granted, they have a lot of covers in it, but that's okay, because Karaoke Revolution has covers too, and they work out really well.

847
01:06:20,463 --> 01:06:30,027
[SPEAKER_17]: Percussion Master has covers of songs like Goonies Are Good Enough, Mickey, I think there was a Britney Spears song I had to play in there too, and then just some other classics as well.

848
01:06:30,307 --> 01:06:31,348
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't remember the whole list.

849
01:06:31,388 --> 01:06:33,029
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sure there's a song list out there on the internet somewhere.

850
01:06:33,289 --> 01:06:34,809
[SPEAKER_17]: But it had a pretty solid song list.

851
01:06:34,849 --> 01:06:35,690
[SPEAKER_17]: I was pretty impressed.

852
01:06:37,236 --> 01:06:38,177
[SPEAKER_17]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

853
01:06:56,154 --> 01:06:58,995
[SPEAKER_17]: So you're beating on a pie and two loaves of bread.

854
01:07:00,116 --> 01:07:02,636
[SPEAKER_17]: But it feels a lot like Taiko, for some reason, when you play.

855
01:07:02,676 --> 01:07:10,579
[SPEAKER_17]: Because it's like, instead of hitting the side of the drum, you're hitting these little things on the top, where normally it would be a very similar striking motion as I would hit the side of the drum.

856
01:07:10,859 --> 01:07:13,240
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's why I think I kind of call it very similar to Taiko.

857
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:17,181
[SPEAKER_17]: But the interface is very much like Drum Mania, where the notes scroll from the top.

858
01:07:17,681 --> 01:07:19,122
[SPEAKER_17]: And it was pretty cool.

859
01:07:19,542 --> 01:07:19,962
[SPEAKER_17]: The only...

860
01:07:21,098 --> 01:07:30,083
[SPEAKER_17]: I guess negative thing I would be able to say about Percussion Master is that it doesn't seem like there's a whole lot you can do with the game.

861
01:07:30,984 --> 01:07:41,190
[SPEAKER_17]: And granted, maybe you could say the same thing about Drum Mania, but it kind of seems like, I don't know, with these three drums, and maybe I didn't play songs that were hard enough, but it kind of seemed like, I think this game might get boring after a while.

862
01:07:42,156 --> 01:07:42,697
[SPEAKER_17]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

863
01:08:01,994 --> 01:08:03,155
[SPEAKER_17]: We sure are no directions.

864
01:08:03,255 --> 01:08:04,297
[SPEAKER_08]: That game is just crazy.

865
01:08:04,337 --> 01:08:06,839
[SPEAKER_08]: You sort of have to guess as you go along.

866
01:08:07,460 --> 01:08:10,042
[SPEAKER_08]: They have one in Santa Cruz on the boardwalk.

867
01:08:10,303 --> 01:08:11,384
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, it's like, huh?

868
01:08:11,744 --> 01:08:14,787
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's distributed by the same people that do the Drumscape game.

869
01:08:14,807 --> 01:08:17,430
[SPEAKER_17]: Because I remember on their site, I thought I saw something about Drumscape.

870
01:08:17,730 --> 01:08:19,932
[SPEAKER_17]: But this is not, I didn't see any ties to MTV.

871
01:08:20,193 --> 01:08:25,238
[SPEAKER_17]: You know what was really kind of funky about this game is that on their high score list, it actually had pictures of the high score people.

872
01:08:25,518 --> 01:08:30,860
[SPEAKER_17]: because the game actually has a little teeny camera in it that takes your picture, like an eye toy type thing, that takes your picture when you get a high score.

873
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:32,380
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, I didn't get any high scores.

874
01:08:32,700 --> 01:08:38,702
[SPEAKER_17]: Go figure, I freaking triple-A'd two of my songs the first time I ever played them.

875
01:08:38,722 --> 01:08:40,523
[SPEAKER_17]: They're not really triple-As, but whatever you want to call them.

876
01:08:40,543 --> 01:08:44,944
[SPEAKER_17]: I got all perfects the first time I played these songs, and I didn't get my picture on the high scoreboard.

877
01:08:45,324 --> 01:08:48,365
[SPEAKER_17]: I guess my scores weren't good enough, somehow, even though I got all perfects.

878
01:08:49,145 --> 01:08:49,385
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh well.

879
01:08:50,066 --> 01:08:51,146
[SPEAKER_17]: Somebody beat me to it, I don't know.

880
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:56,681
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, to answer the question in the chat, is this the MTV licensed game?

881
01:08:57,061 --> 01:09:00,463
[SPEAKER_17]: I didn't see an MTV logo on this game anywhere, so I don't think it's MTV.

882
01:09:00,583 --> 01:09:06,785
[SPEAKER_17]: And there was nothing like Carson Daly wasn't in it, so I don't think there was anything to do with MTV.

883
01:09:07,805 --> 01:09:09,366
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, he's not affiliated with MTV anymore, is he?

884
01:09:09,506 --> 01:09:10,126
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think so.

885
01:09:10,647 --> 01:09:11,387
[SPEAKER_17]: I think he's gone.

886
01:09:11,687 --> 01:09:13,268
[SPEAKER_17]: He works for NBC now, that's right.

887
01:09:14,068 --> 01:09:14,968
[SPEAKER_17]: He has a show on NBC.

888
01:09:15,268 --> 01:09:16,029
[SPEAKER_17]: Why are we talking about that?

889
01:09:16,109 --> 01:09:16,329
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway.

890
01:09:17,469 --> 01:09:19,370
[SPEAKER_17]: That's way too much time for him already.

891
01:09:19,570 --> 01:09:19,710
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

892
01:09:21,198 --> 01:09:29,682
[SPEAKER_17]: So, I got to play the game, I liked it, I just don't think I could play it every day, but it's a nice, like, it's something that I think I'd have fun playing in between games of DDR.

893
01:09:31,463 --> 01:09:42,067
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, Taiko no Dachshund for the PSP, it's awesome, it's great, and you were wondering, I'd be like, looking at the game, I'm like, how the hell is this going to work?

894
01:09:42,187 --> 01:09:48,050
[SPEAKER_17]: Because, I mean, you can't obviously beat the PlayStation with... I was going to say, how can...

895
01:09:48,895 --> 01:09:58,825
[SPEAKER_17]: When I think of Taiko Nutachijin on PSP, I think about Beatmania on the Game Boy, or on the Wonderswan even, and I kind of like... Beatmania on the Wonderswan was great!

896
01:09:59,205 --> 01:10:00,226
[SPEAKER_17]: It was digitized.

897
01:10:00,847 --> 01:10:06,953
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, it was, but, I mean, playing with the buttons and the control pad... Nah, the play was missing for me.

898
01:10:06,973 --> 01:10:07,914
[SPEAKER_17]: It works very simple.

899
01:10:08,174 --> 01:10:10,757
[SPEAKER_17]: Basically, on the Taiko drum, your main...

900
01:10:12,770 --> 01:10:21,095
[SPEAKER_17]: The directional pad and the right drum would be the four buttons.

901
01:10:21,475 --> 01:10:24,177
[SPEAKER_17]: And then the sides are the L button and the R button.

902
01:10:25,218 --> 01:10:26,599
[SPEAKER_17]: And so that's how the game's played.

903
01:10:26,759 --> 01:10:28,680
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's really simple, easy to figure out.

904
01:10:29,080 --> 01:10:31,302
[SPEAKER_17]: The minigames are fucking hilarious.

905
01:10:31,462 --> 01:10:32,182
[SPEAKER_17]: They're great.

906
01:10:32,682 --> 01:10:33,803
[SPEAKER_17]: And they get really hard.

907
01:10:34,223 --> 01:10:35,084
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's a lot of fun.

908
01:10:36,925 --> 01:10:39,006
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd highly recommend the game when it comes out here.

909
01:10:39,127 --> 01:10:40,567
[SPEAKER_17]: It's right now only in Japan.

910
01:10:40,848 --> 01:10:41,328
[SPEAKER_17]: But, um,

911
01:10:42,250 --> 01:10:42,870
[SPEAKER_17]: It looks really good.

912
01:10:42,930 --> 01:10:46,992
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a good start for music games, though, on the PSP, because it's done very, very well.

913
01:10:49,112 --> 01:10:49,792
[SPEAKER_17]: Can't wait to play it.

914
01:10:49,872 --> 01:10:51,673
[SPEAKER_17]: It has Toxic on it, which I thought was weird.

915
01:10:51,993 --> 01:10:54,234
[SPEAKER_17]: Toxic, and there was a couple other songs that were really strange.

916
01:10:54,274 --> 01:10:56,555
[SPEAKER_18]: Is this a Japanese version of Taiko, or is this American?

917
01:10:56,575 --> 01:10:57,475
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, this is Japanese.

918
01:10:57,495 --> 01:10:58,255
[SPEAKER_17]: And they had Toxic?

919
01:10:58,655 --> 01:11:01,036
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't remember that being on any of their... They had Toxic on there.

920
01:11:01,096 --> 01:11:02,276
[SPEAKER_17]: They have We Will Rock You.

921
01:11:02,636 --> 01:11:06,017
[SPEAKER_17]: They also have, of course, you know, Katamari on the Rocks.

922
01:11:06,037 --> 01:11:07,198
[SPEAKER_17]: Of course.

923
01:11:07,278 --> 01:11:10,239
[SPEAKER_17]: And just some other weird songs on there, Ridge Racer and stuff, and...

924
01:11:11,178 --> 01:11:11,618
[SPEAKER_17]: It was fun.

925
01:11:11,658 --> 01:11:12,898
[SPEAKER_17]: They have all the sounds you can unlock.

926
01:11:14,059 --> 01:11:16,179
[SPEAKER_17]: It sounds very similar to the U.S.

927
01:11:16,459 --> 01:11:19,200
[SPEAKER_17]: release, Taiko Drum Master, but on the PSP in Japanese.

928
01:11:19,620 --> 01:11:23,641
[SPEAKER_17]: Like the songs you're saying, I'm thinking, yeah, that wasn't Taiko Drum Master.

929
01:11:25,181 --> 01:11:26,661
[SPEAKER_17]: I couldn't tell you, but it's fun.

930
01:11:27,161 --> 01:11:27,481
[SPEAKER_17]: I like it.

931
01:11:27,801 --> 01:11:28,141
[SPEAKER_17]: Interesting.

932
01:11:29,882 --> 01:11:32,742
[SPEAKER_17]: Wow, we've played a whole lot of new music-based games these past couple weeks.

933
01:11:32,942 --> 01:11:34,503
[SPEAKER_17]: DarkSakura, did you play any new music games?

934
01:11:36,023 --> 01:11:36,203
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

935
01:11:37,623 --> 01:11:38,003
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry to hear it.

936
01:11:38,624 --> 01:11:40,044
[SPEAKER_08]: I told you, I've been getting ready for school.

937
01:11:40,304 --> 01:11:40,924
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, all right.

938
01:11:42,779 --> 01:11:44,000
[SPEAKER_17]: I've been playing Burnout 3.

939
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:46,242
[SPEAKER_17]: That's not really a music-based game, but it's fun.

940
01:11:47,863 --> 01:11:48,583
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll talk about some.

941
01:11:48,603 --> 01:11:51,025
[SPEAKER_17]: I've been playing Illuminus, which is kind of like half a music game.

942
01:11:51,365 --> 01:11:56,309
[SPEAKER_17]: I have all three copies of my puppies on order.

943
01:11:57,030 --> 01:12:01,193
[SPEAKER_17]: Ooh, ooh, I didn't know that Technic Beat was coming out on PSP.

944
01:12:03,454 --> 01:12:04,075
[SPEAKER_17]: That's awesome.

945
01:12:04,591 --> 01:12:05,472
[SPEAKER_17]: What was Technic Beat again?

946
01:12:05,492 --> 01:12:11,437
[SPEAKER_17]: Technic Beat was that one with the little dude that walked around with all the circles and you'd have to walk to the circle and hit the button.

947
01:12:11,677 --> 01:12:16,041
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, and as a reminder also that DJ Maxx is coming out on the PSP.

948
01:12:16,802 --> 01:12:17,622
[SPEAKER_17]: That one's going to be weird though.

949
01:12:17,642 --> 01:12:22,026
[SPEAKER_17]: That's going to be playing just like, I think, Beatmania on the PSP.

950
01:12:22,086 --> 01:12:23,347
[SPEAKER_17]: It's going to be a little weird.

951
01:12:23,607 --> 01:12:24,088
[SPEAKER_17]: Interesting.

952
01:12:24,748 --> 01:12:25,169
[SPEAKER_17]: But cool.

953
01:12:25,429 --> 01:12:26,510
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm still very excited about it.

954
01:12:28,211 --> 01:12:31,254
[SPEAKER_17]: Alrighty, I think what we're going to do now is we're going to go ahead and take a break.

955
01:12:31,594 --> 01:12:40,561
[SPEAKER_17]: And when we come back from this break, we're going to do a little bit of Skype and hear what the callers have to say.

956
01:12:41,582 --> 01:12:42,643
[SPEAKER_17]: So we'll do that.

957
01:12:44,004 --> 01:12:46,246
[SPEAKER_17]: First off, though, I want to see if I can find this.

958
01:12:46,386 --> 01:12:52,311
[SPEAKER_17]: I wanted to play some songs from the new... If I could find it.

959
01:12:52,351 --> 01:12:53,052
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe I don't have it.

960
01:12:53,973 --> 01:12:55,594
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't want to say what it was if I don't really have it.

961
01:12:58,792 --> 01:13:00,052
[SPEAKER_17]: Nevermind, I'll have to look for that for later.

962
01:13:00,193 --> 01:13:04,794
[SPEAKER_17]: And also, we'd like to thank our listeners who voted for us for the podcast awards.

963
01:13:05,074 --> 01:13:05,534
[SPEAKER_17]: Absolutely.

964
01:13:06,595 --> 01:13:07,835
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

965
01:13:07,915 --> 01:13:08,435
[SPEAKER_17]: That's right.

966
01:13:08,936 --> 01:13:09,456
[SPEAKER_17]: Looking at us.

967
01:13:09,596 --> 01:13:09,936
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

968
01:13:11,416 --> 01:13:14,278
[SPEAKER_17]: And also, did you know that this week we're featured on the iTunes store?

969
01:13:14,398 --> 01:13:14,738
[SPEAKER_17]: I saw that.

970
01:13:14,778 --> 01:13:15,398
[SPEAKER_17]: We're on page two.

971
01:13:15,458 --> 01:13:16,178
[SPEAKER_17]: Isn't that crazy?

972
01:13:16,438 --> 01:13:16,558
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

973
01:13:16,958 --> 01:13:18,459
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know how that happened, but we're there.

974
01:13:18,899 --> 01:13:19,619
[SPEAKER_17]: That's pretty awesome.

975
01:13:19,759 --> 01:13:20,520
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not going to complain.

976
01:13:20,980 --> 01:13:21,220
[SPEAKER_17]: Hell no.

977
01:13:23,801 --> 01:13:27,563
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, and I have to apologize for last week, or not really last week.

978
01:13:27,623 --> 01:13:30,045
[SPEAKER_08]: All you had was a headset microphone, first of all.

979
01:13:30,085 --> 01:13:39,890
[SPEAKER_17]: But the week before last, with Katamari Radio, that we were pretty much doing, because we had We Love Katamari at DarkSakura's house.

980
01:13:39,910 --> 01:13:42,811
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, I was going to play music from We Heart Katamari.

981
01:13:42,831 --> 01:13:45,452
[SPEAKER_08]: 50-inch widescreen Katamari.

982
01:13:46,713 --> 01:13:47,954
[SPEAKER_17]: That game is so much fun.

983
01:13:48,194 --> 01:13:48,594
[SPEAKER_17]: I love it.

984
01:13:49,456 --> 01:13:52,339
[SPEAKER_08]: The Namco X Capcom intro looked very cool on my TV.

985
01:13:52,359 --> 01:13:57,442
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I'm going to probably delete that game just because I don't know how to play it and it's all in Japanese.

986
01:13:58,543 --> 01:14:00,385
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, don't delete it yet because I want it.

987
01:14:02,947 --> 01:14:04,908
[SPEAKER_08]: You need to show me where to get that thing you have.

988
01:14:07,961 --> 01:14:10,342
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, we're going to go to a break and we're going to come back and have the Skype line.

989
01:14:10,382 --> 01:14:11,322
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll be back after this.

990
01:14:11,722 --> 01:14:13,402
[SPEAKER_17]: Also, DDR with Fire when we come back.

991
01:14:14,783 --> 01:14:17,463
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll do some Bomani Potpourri in this break.

992
01:14:17,503 --> 01:14:19,404
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll start off with a little bit of Taku.

993
01:14:19,864 --> 01:14:22,064
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe this will perk DarkSakura up, a little bit of Taku.

994
01:14:22,845 --> 01:14:23,085
[SPEAKER_16]: Yay!

995
01:14:23,105 --> 01:14:23,805
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, here we go.

996
01:14:23,865 --> 01:14:24,525
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll be back after this.

997
01:16:12,954 --> 01:16:17,558
Can you keep me like a nasty girl?

998
01:16:17,598 --> 01:16:18,959
You want a nasty love?

999
01:16:19,079 --> 01:16:28,807
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that you want it, honey Feeling so much fear for messy hot tea for love You know that I want it

1000
01:16:45,743 --> 01:16:58,027
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just asking for the real love It's gonna make me feel Take me higher And I'm not proud enough So try to make sure that you feel And I'm proud enough So try to make sure that you feel

[SPEAKER_17]: That game was awesome.

1012
01:21:45,161 --> 01:21:46,222
[SPEAKER_17]: They should have done a sequel to that.

1013
01:21:46,442 --> 01:21:47,042
[SPEAKER_17]: Oha Max.

1014
01:21:48,703 --> 01:21:50,804

1015

01:21:59,207 --> 01:22:00,048
[SPEAKER_17]: This is stupid.

1020
01:22:00,448 --> 01:22:03,249
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway, they're like, we couldn't think of a better name, so Max.

1021
01:22:03,959 --> 01:22:11,863
[SPEAKER_17]: In that break, Taku with Electro-Tuned, not only 2DX 3rd style, I think it was originally in, DDR 5th Mix as well.

1022
01:22:11,963 --> 01:22:16,365
[SPEAKER_17]: Risky Men featuring Asuka with Mr. T, Take Me Higher.

1023
01:22:17,566 --> 01:22:18,186
[SPEAKER_17]: Asuka, sorry.

1024
01:22:18,946 --> 01:22:22,628
[SPEAKER_17]: What, 2DX 4th style as well as... Wasn't it in one of the DDRs?

1025
01:22:22,768 --> 01:22:23,769
[SPEAKER_17]: 5th Mix, DDR, I think?

1026
01:22:24,669 --> 01:22:25,850
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it was one of those unlocks.

1027
01:22:25,890 --> 01:22:27,330
[SPEAKER_17]: Remember how... It was in 5th Mix.

1028
01:22:27,350 --> 01:22:29,151
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, remember how 5th Mix had all those unlocks in it?

1029
01:22:29,531 --> 01:22:31,052
[SPEAKER_17]: I think Electro-Tuned was also one of those songs.

1030
01:22:31,392 --> 01:22:32,733
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, Electro-Tuned was in 5th Mix.

1031
01:22:33,434 --> 01:22:34,535
[SPEAKER_17]: Cherry with Yesterday.

1032
01:22:35,196 --> 01:22:39,319
[SPEAKER_17]: Boy, we played a lot of songs that crossed over in other Bomani games that break without even realizing it.

1033
01:22:39,619 --> 01:22:42,582
[SPEAKER_17]: Cherry, Yesterday was, was that actually in Parapara?

1034
01:22:42,782 --> 01:22:43,482
[SPEAKER_17]: It was in Parapara.

1035
01:22:43,662 --> 01:22:44,163
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, it was.

1036
01:22:44,203 --> 01:22:44,463
[SPEAKER_17]: Was it?

1037
01:22:44,683 --> 01:22:49,227
[SPEAKER_08]: It started off with the right arm sweep, left arm sweep, both arm.

1038
01:22:49,487 --> 01:22:50,568
[SPEAKER_17]: That scares me that you remember that.

1039
01:22:50,919 --> 01:22:52,380
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's like all I remember of it, too.

1040
01:22:53,061 --> 01:22:54,182
[SPEAKER_17]: In 2DX 6-Style, of course.

1041
01:22:54,422 --> 01:22:58,646
[SPEAKER_17]: There was a Para song in 6-Style that wasn't actually in Para Para Paradise.

1042
01:22:58,706 --> 01:23:00,748
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's the song, Para Para Paradise.

1043
01:23:00,768 --> 01:23:01,108
[SPEAKER_17]: That's it.

1044
01:23:01,148 --> 01:23:02,029
[SPEAKER_17]: That's why I'm getting confused.

1045
01:23:02,389 --> 01:23:03,430
[SPEAKER_17]: You remember that song in 6-Style?

1046
01:23:03,591 --> 01:23:04,852
[SPEAKER_17]: Para Para Paradise.

1047
01:23:04,912 --> 01:23:05,752
[SPEAKER_17]: That song wasn't in.

1048
01:23:06,073 --> 01:23:07,334
[SPEAKER_08]: That song was a pain in the ass.

1049
01:23:07,954 --> 01:23:14,861
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway, also, a Konami original there, the Metal Gear Solid mix from Beatmania.

1050
01:23:15,461 --> 01:23:17,343
[SPEAKER_17]: Hell, that wasn't the very first Beatmania, wasn't it?

1051
01:23:18,733 --> 01:23:19,694
[SPEAKER_17]: Beatmania 3rd Mix 3rd Mix

1052
01:23:40,933 --> 01:23:45,499
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, first and second were released as one, with the append.

1053
01:23:45,659 --> 01:23:46,480
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, that's right, that's right.

1054
01:23:46,620 --> 01:23:47,161
[SPEAKER_08]: The Ebisu.

1055
01:23:48,302 --> 01:23:53,448
[SPEAKER_08]: And then there was third, fourth, because... And they were all appends, weren't they?

1056
01:23:53,689 --> 01:23:54,449
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, fifth.

1057
01:23:54,530 --> 01:23:55,551
[SPEAKER_17]: Until they got to sixth.

1058
01:23:56,690 --> 01:23:59,272
[SPEAKER_08]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1059
01:24:19,011 --> 01:24:19,952
[SPEAKER_17]: Exactly, exactly.

1060
01:24:20,172 --> 01:24:21,833
[SPEAKER_17]: Nintendo can get away with that shit.

1061
01:24:22,093 --> 01:24:25,034
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, we're going to release three different versions of Nintendogs, and you're going to buy them all.

1062
01:24:25,655 --> 01:24:28,316
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, but yet... Okay, Nintendo, we love you, bye-bye.

1063
01:24:28,376 --> 01:24:28,896
[SPEAKER_17]: Exactly.

1064
01:24:29,216 --> 01:24:31,878
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, Nintendo, just put out another Zelda game, and we'll be fine.

1065
01:24:34,719 --> 01:24:34,979
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway.

1066
01:24:36,160 --> 01:24:37,801
[SPEAKER_08]: That's how they get you started.

1067
01:24:38,181 --> 01:24:41,663
[SPEAKER_17]: I got told, um, Electro-Tuned was actually in second style.

1068
01:24:42,512 --> 01:24:43,073
[SPEAKER_17]: So I forgot.

1069
01:24:43,493 --> 01:24:43,873
[SPEAKER_17]: I forgot.

1070
01:24:43,954 --> 01:24:44,294
[SPEAKER_17]: You know why?

1071
01:24:44,314 --> 01:24:48,138
[SPEAKER_17]: Because I'm used to playing it in third style PS2.

1072
01:24:48,258 --> 01:24:48,779
[SPEAKER_17]: Give me a break.

1073
01:24:50,280 --> 01:24:50,721
[SPEAKER_17]: No, that's all cool.

1074
01:24:53,837 --> 01:24:54,237
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's see.

1075
01:24:54,397 --> 01:24:56,439
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, also I wanted to say about the Metal Gear Solid theme.

1076
01:24:56,459 --> 01:25:02,002
[SPEAKER_17]: It's also going to be in the upcoming Beatmania USA, at least if the E3 demo is any indication.

1077
01:25:02,262 --> 01:25:07,706
[SPEAKER_17]: That's a game we really haven't heard anything about for quite some time, but it kind of makes sense because, you know, we've got two DDRs looming.

1078
01:25:07,726 --> 01:25:13,069
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm assuming that Konami staff is kind of busy with those games and they'll worry about Beatmania when those two are out.

1079
01:25:14,150 --> 01:25:17,452
[SPEAKER_17]: I think there was a date change or something about it.

1080
01:25:17,952 --> 01:25:19,493
[SPEAKER_17]: It's still in spring.

1081
01:25:19,793 --> 01:25:21,974
[SPEAKER_17]: I think Miklatov is back on the show next week.

1082
01:25:22,074 --> 01:25:23,916
[SPEAKER_17]: I do think he's planning a trip up here next week.

1083
01:25:23,956 --> 01:25:32,501
[SPEAKER_17]: So although he's been very tight on his NDA this year and hasn't been able to give as much juicy gossip on the show, hopefully we'll be able to get something out of him next week.

1084
01:25:32,661 --> 01:25:33,281
[SPEAKER_17]: At least something.

1085
01:25:34,062 --> 01:25:39,545
[SPEAKER_17]: And also the heads of a bunch of game companies are coming to my work at the end of August.

1086
01:25:40,065 --> 01:25:42,627
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm going to get this smooth with the head of Konami.

1087
01:25:43,247 --> 01:25:45,128
[SPEAKER_17]: Take those Orange Ones Radio press kits.

1088
01:25:45,228 --> 01:25:46,489
[SPEAKER_17]: I will be taking the press kits.

1089
01:25:46,509 --> 01:25:49,290
[SPEAKER_17]: Hopefully we haven't bashed too many of their products.

1090
01:25:49,310 --> 01:25:58,354
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to have the head of, what was it, they're going to be, I think Microsoft is coming, Ubisoft, Konami.

1091
01:25:58,574 --> 01:26:01,816
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, there's about 25 invites at least that they're going out to.

1092
01:26:01,876 --> 01:26:08,159
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, tell that Konami dude that they need to release a freaking press release on Xtreme 2 already.

1093
01:26:08,239 --> 01:26:09,319
[SPEAKER_17]: No, I know you're not really going to do that.

1094
01:26:10,720 --> 01:26:12,662
[SPEAKER_17]: Expect a small wave of information in the near future.

1095
01:26:12,682 --> 01:26:13,042
[SPEAKER_17]: Ultramix 3 info

1096
01:26:29,798 --> 01:26:31,319
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, there was more Ultramix 3 info.

1097
01:26:31,339 --> 01:26:32,339
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm glad you brought that up.

1098
01:26:33,099 --> 01:26:36,380
[SPEAKER_17]: That was also a DDR Freak forum thing.

1099
01:26:36,780 --> 01:26:54,887
[SPEAKER_17]: One of the users on there, who I know I've seen their name before as a show listener, so hello guy if you're listening, that was actually Same who sent the email to Zonk's official website asking if they have songs in DDR Ultramix 3 and to come back, yes, DDR Ultramix 3 will feature a song by Zonk and a remix by Zonk.

1100
01:26:55,827 --> 01:26:55,967
[SPEAKER_17]: Hmm.

1101
01:26:57,395 --> 01:26:59,197
[SPEAKER_17]: I forgot what I was going to say.

1102
01:26:59,457 --> 01:27:03,962
[SPEAKER_17]: I looked back, I had to dive back in the archives in my live journal back in the day.

1103
01:27:03,982 --> 01:27:09,568
[SPEAKER_17]: I remember when I found there was a whole unprotected section of Zonk's website that had a bunch of info.

1104
01:27:09,769 --> 01:27:12,772
[SPEAKER_17]: They had a bunch of graphics and stuff that were used in the song.

1105
01:27:13,753 --> 01:27:15,034
[SPEAKER_17]: They don't have that anymore.

1106
01:27:16,616 --> 01:27:17,237
[SPEAKER_17]: Apparently...

1107
01:27:17,867 --> 01:27:27,690
[SPEAKER_17]: DDRFreak managed to dig up this post that said the forbidden dance dance Basile from the Or If Is release will be in Ultramix 3.

1108
01:27:29,403 --> 01:27:30,264
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a weird song.

1109
01:27:30,504 --> 01:27:34,407
[SPEAKER_17]: Orifice was the folks that did Art of Hot, also.

1110
01:27:35,127 --> 01:27:38,209
[SPEAKER_17]: Orifice is just one of the guys from Zonk, also, if you didn't know that.

1111
01:27:38,290 --> 01:27:39,751
[SPEAKER_17]: Orifice and Zonk are kind of related.

1112
01:27:40,211 --> 01:27:41,372
[SPEAKER_17]: Orifice is just one of the guys from Zonk.

1113
01:27:41,632 --> 01:27:44,234
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think their song, Art of Hot, I think was the name of it?

1114
01:27:44,274 --> 01:27:45,435
[SPEAKER_17]: Or was that another group?

1115
01:27:46,335 --> 01:27:46,776
[SPEAKER_17]: I can't remember.

1116
01:27:46,816 --> 01:27:52,420
[SPEAKER_17]: It's one of those songs, I have to admit, I love the Zonk song in Ultramix 2, but I don't really play the Orifice song very much.

1117
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:53,340
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry to say.

1118
01:27:54,321 --> 01:27:55,182
[SPEAKER_17]: I wasn't a big fan of that.

1119
01:27:56,603 --> 01:27:56,723
[SPEAKER_14]: Yep.

1120
01:27:58,815 --> 01:28:01,457
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's very interesting how many folks are coming back.

1121
01:28:03,258 --> 01:28:03,879
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, I screwed up.

1122
01:28:03,919 --> 01:28:05,280
[SPEAKER_17]: The name of the song is I Spy.

1123
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:06,421
[SPEAKER_17]: I found a clip of it.

1124
01:28:06,461 --> 01:28:06,781
[SPEAKER_17]: Here it is.

1125
01:28:06,901 --> 01:28:07,762
[SPEAKER_17]: Art of Hot was another band.

1126
01:28:08,682 --> 01:28:09,603
[SPEAKER_17]: That's the Orifice one.

1127
01:28:13,046 --> 01:28:15,167
[SPEAKER_17]: And you can kind of see the similarities there to Zonk.

1128
01:28:16,978 --> 01:28:19,939
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway.

1129
01:28:20,839 --> 01:28:25,281
[SPEAKER_17]: Rene posted us a link in the chat room on Konami's official website.

1130
01:28:25,321 --> 01:28:27,621
[SPEAKER_17]: They're still saying Spring 2006 for Beatmania.

1131
01:28:28,162 --> 01:28:29,402
[SPEAKER_17]: There's an official little link there.

1132
01:28:29,422 --> 01:28:30,602
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I think it's still Spring.

1133
01:28:31,783 --> 01:28:32,303
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll ask him.

1134
01:28:33,063 --> 01:28:33,463
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll bug him.

1135
01:28:33,983 --> 01:28:37,524
[SPEAKER_17]: Because what's great about, you know, it's just... I don't know.

1136
01:28:38,065 --> 01:28:39,045
[SPEAKER_17]: I know the most about games.

1137
01:28:40,085 --> 01:28:41,646
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just what it comes down to.

1138
01:28:42,126 --> 01:28:42,346
[SPEAKER_17]: Just...

1139
01:28:42,853 --> 01:28:48,079
[SPEAKER_17]: Find out already if Cartoon Heroes is going to be an Extreme 2 or not so we can shut these people on DDR Freak up.

1140
01:28:48,580 --> 01:28:49,040
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1141
01:28:49,761 --> 01:28:50,041
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright.

1142
01:28:51,042 --> 01:28:54,166
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway, I guess we should open up the Skype line.

1143
01:28:55,307 --> 01:28:56,268
[SPEAKER_17]: See if we can get some calls.

1144
01:28:56,669 --> 01:28:57,510
[SPEAKER_08]: We've had people asking.

1145
01:28:58,190 --> 01:28:58,471
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright.

1146
01:28:59,872 --> 01:29:01,234
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I'm firing up Skype right now.

1147
01:29:01,707 --> 01:29:02,328
[SPEAKER_17]: Logging in.

1148
01:29:02,368 --> 01:29:02,888
[SPEAKER_17]: Beep, beep, beep.

1149
01:29:02,908 --> 01:29:03,329
[SPEAKER_17]: Here we go.

1150
01:29:03,849 --> 01:29:05,951
[SPEAKER_17]: I should see if there's been any upgrades to Skype recently.

1151
01:29:06,252 --> 01:29:09,895
[SPEAKER_17]: You know you should check Skype's website often because they do fix their program quite often.

1152
01:29:09,915 --> 01:29:11,257
[SPEAKER_17]: They always release new ones.

1153
01:29:11,817 --> 01:29:15,501
[SPEAKER_17]: Did you know, by the way, we have like 61 people on our list on Skype?

1154
01:29:15,541 --> 01:29:16,342
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that's kind of cool.

1155
01:29:17,102 --> 01:29:19,765
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, so I just logged on to Skype and there's only like five people in.

1156
01:29:20,005 --> 01:29:20,526
[SPEAKER_17]: What's up with that?

1157
01:29:22,065 --> 01:29:23,085
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, we're up and running.

1158
01:29:23,145 --> 01:29:25,946
[SPEAKER_17]: We're ready for you guys to start calling in if you want to call us.

1159
01:29:26,966 --> 01:29:33,128
[SPEAKER_17]: Remember, if you want more information on how to call the program, www.orangeloungeradio.com.

1160
01:29:33,448 --> 01:29:38,089
[SPEAKER_17]: Click on Interact With Us, and it has more information about the Skype line.

1161
01:29:38,129 --> 01:29:39,969
[SPEAKER_17]: And I just dropped my mouse, which is really smooth.

1162
01:29:40,029 --> 01:29:40,649
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, DarkSakura?

1163
01:29:41,550 --> 01:29:42,610
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I'm saying I'm about.

1164
01:29:43,250 --> 01:29:45,050
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, me dropping my mouse, yeah.

1165
01:29:45,671 --> 01:29:46,671
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, look, we got a call.

1166
01:29:46,731 --> 01:29:47,311
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's take it.

1167
01:29:47,391 --> 01:29:49,611
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, this is a guy that used to call us like all the freaking time.

1168
01:29:49,631 --> 01:29:50,592
[SPEAKER_17]: We haven't talked to him in a while.

1169
01:29:51,192 --> 01:29:51,672
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's do this.

1170
01:29:52,611 --> 01:29:53,752
[SPEAKER_17]: Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1171
01:29:55,053 --> 01:29:55,973
[SPEAKER_17]: Legend of Zaku here.

1172
01:29:56,193 --> 01:29:57,734
[SPEAKER_19]: Hello, Legend of Zaku.

1173
01:29:57,774 --> 01:29:58,715
[SPEAKER_19]: Long time no chat.

1174
01:29:59,515 --> 01:29:59,976
[SPEAKER_19]: I know.

1175
01:30:00,116 --> 01:30:02,057
[SPEAKER_19]: I finally got broadband, so now I can do this.

1176
01:30:02,377 --> 01:30:04,959
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm in the middle of a storm, so I'm going to try to make this real quick.

1177
01:30:05,299 --> 01:30:05,599
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright.

1178
01:30:05,619 --> 01:30:07,140
[SPEAKER_17]: Congratulations on the broadband upgrade.

1179
01:30:08,281 --> 01:30:08,801
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, man.

1180
01:30:08,881 --> 01:30:13,004
[SPEAKER_19]: Anyways, I could vouch for you for the whole In the Group 2 thing.

1181
01:30:13,524 --> 01:30:13,904
[SPEAKER_19]: How so?

1182
01:30:13,964 --> 01:30:18,287
[SPEAKER_19]: Because I've been already playing this game since, what, July?

1183
01:30:19,388 --> 01:30:19,848
[SPEAKER_19]: Last month?

1184
01:30:19,868 --> 01:30:19,948
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

1185
01:30:20,999 --> 01:30:24,926
[SPEAKER_19]: That's all I've been doing, playing in the groove in Coney Island and Chinatown.

1186
01:30:24,986 --> 01:30:28,172
[SPEAKER_19]: So I can pretty much say it's a big improvement from the first one.

1187
01:30:28,913 --> 01:30:29,254
[SPEAKER_17]: Really?

1188
01:30:29,354 --> 01:30:31,558
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know if that's really vouching for me, but okay.

1189
01:30:31,838 --> 01:30:33,862
[SPEAKER_08]: Item by item, can you name how it's better?

1190
01:30:35,290 --> 01:30:46,874
[SPEAKER_19]: Let me see, Freeze Rules, the fact that, you know, it's just a, you know, with the new cabinet and the fact that the pads aren't as, you know, aren't as just crappy as, you know, as if you were actually putting it in a DDR machine.

1191
01:30:47,174 --> 01:30:48,054
[SPEAKER_17]: Let me state this, too.

1192
01:30:48,134 --> 01:30:59,357
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe I should have gotten this out because, and this is one thing where I may have said that In the Groove 2 looks exactly like In the Groove 1, because the machine it ate on the break is an upgraded old cabinet, you know, like a DDR cabinet from back in the day.

1193
01:30:59,958 --> 01:31:00,098
[SPEAKER_17]: So...

1194
01:31:01,559 --> 01:31:02,560
[SPEAKER_17]: Two in the group's credit.

1195
01:31:02,600 --> 01:31:04,400
[SPEAKER_17]: That might be part of the reason why I'm feeling that way.

1196
01:31:04,500 --> 01:31:05,361
[SPEAKER_17]: I didn't see a new build.

1197
01:31:05,941 --> 01:31:09,543
[SPEAKER_19]: Most of the in the group two machines are brand new in the city.

1198
01:31:10,703 --> 01:31:11,604
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I missed them.

1199
01:31:12,024 --> 01:31:13,905
[SPEAKER_17]: Zaku, you should have called me while I was out there.

1200
01:31:14,663 --> 01:31:19,386
[SPEAKER_19]: I was getting my broadband set up last week, so add to that.

1201
01:31:20,086 --> 01:31:20,967
[SPEAKER_17]: I may be coming back.

1202
01:31:21,067 --> 01:31:22,288
[SPEAKER_17]: I may be coming back very soon.

1203
01:31:22,708 --> 01:31:23,629
[SPEAKER_19]: Are you sure about it?

1204
01:31:24,249 --> 01:31:29,152
[SPEAKER_19]: You know Digital Life Expo is happening in October.

1205
01:31:29,272 --> 01:31:31,173
[SPEAKER_19]: I know, but I don't know if I can swing the time off work.

1206
01:31:32,454 --> 01:31:33,475
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, it's worth it.

1207
01:31:33,815 --> 01:31:34,415
[SPEAKER_19]: Think about it.

1208
01:31:34,995 --> 01:31:39,738
[SPEAKER_19]: What would persuade you to actually go there and bring the rest of the people so that way you can broadcast it live?

1209
01:31:39,818 --> 01:31:40,859
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not about persuading me.

1210
01:31:40,899 --> 01:31:43,881
[SPEAKER_17]: It's about persuading my boss, and I'm sure Loki and DarkSakura feel similar.

1211
01:31:44,855 --> 01:31:45,176
[SPEAKER_17]: DarkSakura.com

1212
01:31:54,858 --> 01:31:59,802
[SPEAKER_17]: Me, personally, I would love to come out there if I can get the time off, which I don't know if it's very likely.

1213
01:32:00,162 --> 01:32:02,104
[SPEAKER_17]: I did see the advertisement about the tournament.

1214
01:32:02,444 --> 01:32:03,145
[SPEAKER_17]: It's tempting.

1215
01:32:03,525 --> 01:32:05,867
[SPEAKER_17]: I think I'd know more people in an NYC tournament.

1216
01:32:05,907 --> 01:32:09,510
[SPEAKER_19]: Hopefully I should be competing there this year again, like I did last.

1217
01:32:09,790 --> 01:32:10,791
[SPEAKER_17]: Let me put it this way, Zaku.

1218
01:32:10,811 --> 01:32:11,692
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not saying no yet.

1219
01:32:12,152 --> 01:32:14,094
[SPEAKER_19]: I am considering the idea.

1220
01:32:14,174 --> 01:32:15,214
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, one more thing.

1221
01:32:15,415 --> 01:32:19,238
[SPEAKER_19]: As you already know, we New Yorkers already have an unlocked 2DX11 Red kit.

1222
01:32:20,719 --> 01:32:22,721
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, I've already played 2DX11 Red.

1223
01:32:22,761 --> 01:32:24,322
[SPEAKER_19]: Where did a 2DX Red go in New York?

1224
01:32:25,730 --> 01:32:27,552
[SPEAKER_19]: This place called Tri-County Fair in Long Island.

1225
01:32:29,074 --> 01:32:29,434
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, okay.

1226
01:32:29,814 --> 01:32:31,476
[SPEAKER_17]: See, I didn't get a chance to go to Coney Island at all.

1227
01:32:31,496 --> 01:32:33,838
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, there's a lot in New York City, as you know.

1228
01:32:34,639 --> 01:32:36,300
[SPEAKER_17]: So I didn't get a chance to really do everything.

1229
01:32:36,320 --> 01:32:37,081
[SPEAKER_17]: That's why I want to go back.

1230
01:32:37,902 --> 01:32:42,866
[SPEAKER_19]: It's an unlocked machine, so we pretty much have all the other unlocks, you know, since the kit is straight from Japan.

1231
01:32:43,507 --> 01:32:44,007
[SPEAKER_19]: It's used.

1232
01:32:44,368 --> 01:32:51,094
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, I had heard something about an In The Groove 2 machine that opened up somewhere in Michigan.

1233
01:32:51,114 --> 01:32:51,194
Yeah.

1234
01:32:51,658 --> 01:33:10,411
[SPEAKER_17]: and it already had everything unlocked and all these people saw all these new songs they weren't supposed to and then the next day the lock was back on and all the songs were gone and they didn't realize anyway, I don't know I don't know why I thought to mention that I just kind of remembered that right now because I was hearing this story just like yesterday so anyway, I'm just throwing that out there

1235
01:33:13,177 --> 01:33:16,418
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, man, that's what's been going on in New York so far.

1236
01:33:16,558 --> 01:33:22,480
[SPEAKER_17]: So this Digital Life tournament that's coming up, is this the one where they're giving away, like, thousands of dollars or something for the freestyle?

1237
01:33:22,540 --> 01:33:27,342
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, two grand is a grand prize for most, if not all, the events in the first place.

1238
01:33:27,442 --> 01:33:35,085
[SPEAKER_17]: So I know, now, is Digital Life the same one that Frequency went to last year, and we interviewed him after that, and he had had the run-in with, like...

1239
01:33:35,625 --> 01:33:39,506
[SPEAKER_19]: Much music and stuff.

1240
01:33:39,806 --> 01:33:47,107
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I basically told him about how you wanted to interview him and all that.

1241
01:33:47,227 --> 01:33:48,887
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I remember that.

1242
01:33:49,448 --> 01:33:52,968
[SPEAKER_17]: So yeah, I would love to go to that event if I can make it work.

1243
01:33:53,008 --> 01:33:54,749
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know if I can, but I will try.

1244
01:33:55,469 --> 01:33:57,309
[SPEAKER_19]: See what you can do, man.

1245
01:33:57,349 --> 01:33:59,389
[SPEAKER_19]: We would love to have you out there.

1246
01:33:59,769 --> 01:34:02,290
[SPEAKER_19]: That would be good promotion-wise for Orange Lounge.

1247
01:34:03,220 --> 01:34:05,902
[SPEAKER_18]: Freestyle Twin, I'm going to be entering freestyle, like I did last year

1248
01:34:29,216 --> 01:34:41,044
[SPEAKER_19]: I think I'm planning on doing Swing It from Fifth Mix, trying to dress up like Pee Wee Herman with the platform shoes, red bow tie, the buzz cut, the whole nine yards for that one.

1249
01:34:41,625 --> 01:34:42,285
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm thinking about it.

1250
01:34:42,365 --> 01:34:43,286
[SPEAKER_19]: It's getting close to that.

1251
01:34:43,906 --> 01:34:46,088
[SPEAKER_19]: That's dedicated.

1252
01:34:47,662 --> 01:35:01,787
[SPEAKER_19]: No, I love... I love... Most of the veteran DJs, freestylers in, you know, in the city, basically, you know, they really like that, you know, they really have some good positive, you know, positive impressions on it when I first told it to them.

1253
01:35:03,367 --> 01:35:07,389
[SPEAKER_17]: This would be Legend of Zaku doing freestyle at the Digital Life Tournament.

1254
01:35:08,029 --> 01:35:08,749
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, God.

1255
01:35:20,776 --> 01:35:25,658
[SPEAKER_17]: That had to be it.

1256
01:35:25,978 --> 01:35:28,540
[SPEAKER_17]: That's about it.

1257
01:35:28,600 --> 01:35:31,481
[SPEAKER_19]: I told you what's been happening so far and what we already have.

1258
01:35:32,801 --> 01:35:36,803
[SPEAKER_19]: Just waiting for October to roll by, pretty much.

1259
01:35:37,363 --> 01:35:39,004
[SPEAKER_17]: So this tournament's going to be big news then, huh?

1260
01:35:39,835 --> 01:35:43,718
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I just hope you could try to pull something.

1261
01:35:43,999 --> 01:35:51,985
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll see, but all you other East Coasters, I know we have other East Coasters listening to the show, make your way out to this tournament, because it's going to be freaking huge, and they're giving away money, lots of it.

1262
01:35:52,566 --> 01:35:53,246
[SPEAKER_17]: Money, money, money.

1263
01:35:53,907 --> 01:35:55,568
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, loads of money being given away.

1264
01:35:55,669 --> 01:35:58,471
[SPEAKER_19]: Just at least try, man.

1265
01:36:00,312 --> 01:36:04,336
[SPEAKER_08]: If someone buys me a ticket and it's on a weekend, I'll do it.

1266
01:36:04,476 --> 01:36:05,457
[SPEAKER_19]: It is, the tournament's on a weekend.

1267
01:36:06,314 --> 01:36:06,994
[SPEAKER_17]: It's on a weekend.

1268
01:36:07,074 --> 01:36:09,736
[SPEAKER_08]: Someone buys me a ticket for Friday and flies me back Sunday.

1269
01:36:09,776 --> 01:36:10,116
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll go.

1270
01:36:10,316 --> 01:36:11,617
[SPEAKER_17]: JetBlue's got reasonable rates.

1271
01:36:12,257 --> 01:36:13,878
[SPEAKER_17]: You don't want to fly Friday and Sunday.

1272
01:36:13,918 --> 01:36:15,238
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, it's all day flying.

1273
01:36:15,258 --> 01:36:17,700
[SPEAKER_17]: With the time zones changing and everything, it's all day flying.

1274
01:36:18,760 --> 01:36:19,380
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't need sleep.

1275
01:36:21,081 --> 01:36:22,802
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll see what happens, Zaku.

1276
01:36:22,982 --> 01:36:24,083
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll have a meeting on it.

1277
01:36:24,203 --> 01:36:24,403
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay?

1278
01:36:24,423 --> 01:36:25,043
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll have a meeting.

1279
01:36:25,823 --> 01:36:26,144
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

1280
01:36:26,604 --> 01:36:27,564
[SPEAKER_17]: Take care, Zaku.

1281
01:36:27,624 --> 01:36:28,045
[SPEAKER_17]: Have a good one.

1282
01:36:28,465 --> 01:36:28,745
[SPEAKER_17]: Later.

1283
01:36:28,845 --> 01:36:29,345
[SPEAKER_17]: Bye.

1284
01:36:31,066 --> 01:36:32,427
[SPEAKER_17]: Skypline's open if you want to call in.

1285
01:36:32,627 --> 01:36:33,587
[SPEAKER_17]: www.orange.com.

1286
01:36:33,627 --> 01:36:34,348
[SPEAKER_14]: I was going to mention.

1287
01:36:34,368 --> 01:36:35,048
[SPEAKER_17]: Don't interact with us.

1288
01:36:35,919 --> 01:36:41,981
[SPEAKER_17]: Freeze Rolls, you know, that's really innovative because I've never seen that in another dance game, like Pump It Up or anything.

1289
01:36:43,082 --> 01:36:43,522
Stop.

1290
01:36:46,283 --> 01:36:50,704
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, we're getting constructive feedback in the chat room that we're really mellow tonight.

1291
01:36:52,485 --> 01:36:55,366
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, I forgot to mention, I need a picture of me doing this show.

1292
01:36:55,926 --> 01:36:56,206
[SPEAKER_17]: Why?

1293
01:36:56,746 --> 01:37:00,728
[SPEAKER_17]: Because they're doing a little article about us in my...

1294
01:37:02,145 --> 01:37:06,988
[SPEAKER_17]: Was it the, our kind of in-company magazine thing?

1295
01:37:07,768 --> 01:37:13,892
[SPEAKER_17]: They want it because, you know, they're Can we just grab a screen capture of you from the No, I look retarded.

1296
01:37:14,032 --> 01:37:15,653
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't want the retarded pictures.

1297
01:37:15,953 --> 01:37:17,714
[SPEAKER_17]: I want a non-retarded picture.

1298
01:37:17,794 --> 01:37:19,135
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what I was looking for.

1299
01:37:19,655 --> 01:37:24,338
[SPEAKER_17]: And unfortunately, every single picture I've taken of, you know, me has been a retarded one.

1300
01:37:24,618 --> 01:37:27,319
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not retarded, so why do my pictures come out retarded?

1301
01:37:27,360 --> 01:37:28,120
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what I want to know.

1302
01:37:30,700 --> 01:37:31,800
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh yeah, picture of my foot.

1303
01:37:31,840 --> 01:37:32,801
[SPEAKER_17]: That would be perfect.

1304
01:37:32,901 --> 01:37:36,782
[SPEAKER_17]: Send the picture of your feet from the second movie.

1305
01:37:36,802 --> 01:37:36,842
[SPEAKER_02]: No!

1306
01:37:37,703 --> 01:37:37,923
[SPEAKER_17]: What?

1307
01:37:41,084 --> 01:37:46,286
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, now, Loki, we've just had a bit of anger, so DarkSakura, let's further us down the un-Mellow spiral.

1308
01:37:46,346 --> 01:37:49,727
[SPEAKER_08]: There's somebody on the Gorillas board I post on.

1309
01:37:50,707 --> 01:37:54,869
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been, by the way, made supermod on Gorillas Unofficial, which I'm very happy for.

1310
01:37:55,728 --> 01:38:01,753
[SPEAKER_08]: But there's a person who, I'm not going to name names, but who posts 75 posts a day on average.

1311
01:38:01,773 --> 01:38:03,955
[SPEAKER_17]: Does their name start with the letter S?

1312
01:38:04,495 --> 01:38:04,635
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1313
01:38:05,196 --> 01:38:06,076
[SPEAKER_17]: The letter T?

1314
01:38:06,457 --> 01:38:06,597
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1315
01:38:07,778 --> 01:38:11,741
[SPEAKER_08]: But there's a thread on here that says, describe the person above you.

1316
01:38:12,541 --> 01:38:15,083
[SPEAKER_08]: And he put, does not love Katamari or his cousins.

1317
01:38:15,984 --> 01:38:16,404
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

1318
01:38:17,105 --> 01:38:17,725
[SPEAKER_08]: He's the prince.

1319
01:38:17,785 --> 01:38:18,946
[SPEAKER_08]: His name is not Katamari.

1320
01:38:20,348 --> 01:38:20,508
[SPEAKER_08]: Ugh.

1321
01:38:20,528 --> 01:38:23,390
[SPEAKER_08]: It just, people frustrate me.

1322
01:38:26,357 --> 01:38:27,578
[SPEAKER_08]: It's video game related.

1323
01:38:28,098 --> 01:38:29,359
[SPEAKER_08]: And you want to know what, though?

1324
01:38:29,679 --> 01:38:33,161
[SPEAKER_08]: This isn't the only person that I have seen say stuff like this.

1325
01:38:34,782 --> 01:38:36,343
[SPEAKER_08]: On a variety of boards.

1326
01:38:37,264 --> 01:38:40,946
[SPEAKER_08]: They think that the primary character in a game is named after the game.

1327
01:38:41,307 --> 01:38:41,787
[SPEAKER_17]: After the game.

1328
01:38:42,888 --> 01:38:46,790
[SPEAKER_17]: Like, did you know that when you play Legend of Zelda, you're actually playing Zelda moving around?

1329
01:38:46,830 --> 01:38:47,811
[SPEAKER_17]: Who thought that?

1330
01:38:47,871 --> 01:38:48,491
[SPEAKER_17]: I know, I know.

1331
01:38:49,052 --> 01:38:55,756
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's just... I would say that people, if they're going to be a fan of the game, actually know something about it.

1332
01:38:56,865 --> 01:39:00,927
[SPEAKER_17]: See, in some cases you luck out because in Super Mario Bros.

1333
01:39:00,948 --> 01:39:02,829
[SPEAKER_17]: you actually play as Super Mario.

1334
01:39:04,810 --> 01:39:07,871
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but I've heard people call Luigi Mario too.

1335
01:39:09,892 --> 01:39:10,593
[SPEAKER_08]: And Green Mario.

1336
01:39:10,673 --> 01:39:11,293
[SPEAKER_08]: This is back when.

1337
01:39:11,313 --> 01:39:11,993
[SPEAKER_08]: Green Mario.

1338
01:39:12,634 --> 01:39:13,935
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I kid you not.

1339
01:39:14,555 --> 01:39:14,795
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

1340
01:39:16,181 --> 01:39:23,667
[SPEAKER_17]: I dug this up and I had to play it because it's been like three weeks since I've done this, so I need a little pick-me-up.

1341
01:39:24,008 --> 01:39:25,469
[SPEAKER_17]: I need a little bit of Unmallow here.

1342
01:39:25,489 --> 01:39:25,549
[SPEAKER_17]: God!

1343
01:39:26,089 --> 01:39:27,070
[SPEAKER_17]: I already know what this is.

1344
01:39:27,150 --> 01:39:29,612
[SPEAKER_17]: Hey, Loki, what do you think about gay sex?

1345
01:39:29,953 --> 01:39:30,973
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, it's so much fun.

1346
01:39:35,818 --> 01:39:37,339
[SPEAKER_17]: That'll never get old, will it?

1347
01:39:38,240 --> 01:39:39,060
[SPEAKER_17]: Actually, it will get old.

1348
01:39:39,260 --> 01:39:41,422
[SPEAKER_17]: Because there's another joke we used to do the same thing for.

1349
01:39:41,863 --> 01:39:42,143
[SPEAKER_17]: I know.

1350
01:39:42,748 --> 01:39:45,030
[SPEAKER_17]: But then you'll just do something stupid and we'll have something else.

1351
01:39:46,552 --> 01:39:46,852
[SPEAKER_17]: Hey!

1352
01:39:47,473 --> 01:39:48,053
[SPEAKER_17]: I forgot.

1353
01:39:48,093 --> 01:39:49,695
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I actually didn't forget to mention.

1354
01:39:50,756 --> 01:39:51,517
[SPEAKER_17]: September 11th.

1355
01:39:52,738 --> 01:39:54,440
[SPEAKER_17]: No, we're not using that picture!

1356
01:39:56,342 --> 01:39:59,665
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you to the chat room listener who sent us that picture of Loki.

1357
01:40:02,186 --> 01:40:07,129
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, they had to pick the most retarded shot of me and... Sakurina, you can thank for that one.

1358
01:40:07,149 --> 01:40:10,991
[SPEAKER_17]: Retarded, like, one second of the entire 20-minute interview.

1359
01:40:11,151 --> 01:40:13,972
[SPEAKER_17]: It's actually a part of a much larger site.

1360
01:40:13,992 --> 01:40:14,953
[SPEAKER_17]: I can show you this site here.

1361
01:40:15,353 --> 01:40:16,234
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I know, I know.

1362
01:40:19,418 --> 01:40:22,200
[SPEAKER_08]: Those sites irritate the shit out of me.

1363
01:40:23,020 --> 01:40:23,821
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's funny.

1364
01:40:24,562 --> 01:40:25,723
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's not funny.

1365
01:40:25,743 --> 01:40:26,543
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's funny.

1366
01:40:26,563 --> 01:40:30,146
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's even a whole thread on DDR Freak dedicated to him in the imaging form.

1367
01:40:30,226 --> 01:40:31,107
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, never mind, never mind.

1368
01:40:31,247 --> 01:40:36,331
[SPEAKER_08]: I was going to say... Whatever those things are, that internet joke needs to die.

1369
01:40:36,651 --> 01:40:40,314
[SPEAKER_17]: YTMND, but that's not... What the fuck does that even mean anyway?

1370
01:40:40,575 --> 01:40:40,975
[SPEAKER_17]: You're...

1371
01:40:42,536 --> 01:40:44,538
[SPEAKER_17]: It's some catchphrase that started the whole thing.

1372
01:40:44,738 --> 01:40:45,579
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's stupid!

1373
01:40:45,699 --> 01:40:46,099
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, wait.

1374
01:40:46,279 --> 01:40:48,941
[SPEAKER_17]: But that was not an actual YTMND site.

1375
01:40:49,102 --> 01:40:52,644
[SPEAKER_17]: That was the knockoff YTMND site.

1376
01:40:52,664 --> 01:40:54,546
[SPEAKER_17]: That's actually somebody's placeholder for their real site.

1377
01:40:54,846 --> 01:41:01,291
[SPEAKER_17]: However, we had another listener head on over to YTMND and actually came up with this.

1378
01:41:01,451 --> 01:41:03,092
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm loading this up right now for the chat.

1379
01:41:03,833 --> 01:41:07,056
[SPEAKER_17]: Or for DarkSakura to... I'm not looking at it.

1380
01:41:07,136 --> 01:41:07,536
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, you are.

1381
01:41:08,477 --> 01:41:09,197
[SPEAKER_17]: It's really funny.

1382
01:41:09,317 --> 01:41:10,378
[SPEAKER_08]: Those things give me headaches.

1383
01:41:10,458 --> 01:41:11,339
[SPEAKER_08]: I kid you not.

1384
01:41:12,665 --> 01:41:13,745
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, where's the graphic?

1385
01:41:14,765 --> 01:41:17,486
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey, Loki, what do you think about gay sex?

1386
01:41:17,826 --> 01:41:19,906
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, it's so much fun.

1387
01:41:19,967 --> 01:41:21,527
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey, Loki, what do you think about gay sex?

1388
01:41:21,567 --> 01:41:23,247
[SPEAKER_16]: It actually shows Loki having gay sex.

1389
01:41:24,067 --> 01:41:26,748
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey, Loki, what do you think about gay sex?

1390
01:41:27,088 --> 01:41:28,068
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, it's so much fun.

1391
01:41:28,688 --> 01:41:31,969
[SPEAKER_17]: Hey, Loki, what do you think about... Yeah, and a picture of me drunk.

1392
01:41:33,209 --> 01:41:36,850
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyways, September 11th, I'm going to be getting drunk here.

1393
01:41:40,291 --> 01:41:41,831
[SPEAKER_17]: You're the man now, dawg.

1394
01:41:42,216 --> 01:41:43,717
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what YTMND stands for.

1395
01:41:43,757 --> 01:41:45,579
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's something that Randy Jackson said once.

1396
01:41:46,199 --> 01:41:48,121
[SPEAKER_08]: And by the way, I'm not trying to be mean about anybody.

1397
01:41:48,141 --> 01:41:49,422
[SPEAKER_08]: I just had to vent for a moment.

1398
01:41:50,623 --> 01:41:51,764
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, yeah.

1399
01:41:52,644 --> 01:41:53,645
[SPEAKER_08]: I made a public correction.

1400
01:41:53,905 --> 01:41:56,788
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, so September 11th, you're going to be drinking because it's your birthday, right?

1401
01:41:56,928 --> 01:41:59,109
[SPEAKER_17]: So do you have the day after off work or something?

1402
01:41:59,150 --> 01:41:59,710
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, sure, whatever.

1403
01:42:01,652 --> 01:42:02,372
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, fine.

1404
01:42:05,435 --> 01:42:05,795
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

1405
01:42:06,502 --> 01:42:10,904
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I actually had to load that YTMND site in Explorer.

1406
01:42:10,964 --> 01:42:12,105
[SPEAKER_17]: It doesn't work in Firefox.

1407
01:42:12,565 --> 01:42:18,668
[SPEAKER_17]: Because Firefox is smart to block those things that repeat the sound files over and over and the graphics over and over.

1408
01:42:18,688 --> 01:42:19,288
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what, though?

1409
01:42:19,728 --> 01:42:29,993
[SPEAKER_08]: Those things, it's like when they would give those, you know, when to entertain a blonde turnover, when to entertain a blonde turnover, it's the same type of stupid things.

1410
01:42:31,949 --> 01:42:34,410
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, I did see a really, really funny one, though, once.

1411
01:42:35,191 --> 01:42:38,973
[SPEAKER_17]: And it was the... I don't even know if I should repeat this on the air.

1412
01:42:39,413 --> 01:42:42,315
[SPEAKER_17]: But it was that screen capture from Mike Tyson's Punch Out.

1413
01:42:42,375 --> 01:42:44,036
[SPEAKER_17]: Remember when you would, like, beat a stage?

1414
01:42:44,556 --> 01:42:48,798
[SPEAKER_17]: It would show, like, Little Mac in training, and he's running through, like, the streets of New York.

1415
01:42:49,098 --> 01:42:58,203
[SPEAKER_17]: And it shows his coach, which was this really big, fat, black guy, remember, that, like, Al Roker used to be, that was on the bike, that was kind of riding in front of him and pacing him.

1416
01:42:58,663 --> 01:42:58,984
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's...

1417
01:43:00,664 --> 01:43:04,205
[SPEAKER_17]: It's, nigga stole my bike.

1418
01:43:05,766 --> 01:43:14,088
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's just really funny because that's not really what's happening in the picture, but then when you look at it in that perspective and it shows a little animation, it kind of looks like it.

1419
01:43:14,729 --> 01:43:15,969
[SPEAKER_17]: That the guy stole his bike.

1420
01:43:16,576 --> 01:43:17,777
[SPEAKER_08]: Those things don't amuse me.

1421
01:43:17,797 --> 01:43:18,877
[SPEAKER_17]: That's the funniest one I ever saw.

1422
01:43:19,097 --> 01:43:22,599
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that those are meant to amuse the easily amused.

1423
01:43:23,420 --> 01:43:24,941
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'd say complex amusement.

1424
01:43:26,061 --> 01:43:29,143
[SPEAKER_08]: I need something with more substance to amuse me.

1425
01:43:29,163 --> 01:43:29,923
[SPEAKER_17]: What do they call those?

1426
01:43:32,084 --> 01:43:33,485
[SPEAKER_17]: You have snobby humor.

1427
01:43:34,806 --> 01:43:35,746
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't help it.

1428
01:43:35,766 --> 01:43:37,567
[SPEAKER_17]: You're stuck up when it comes to your humor.

1429
01:43:37,587 --> 01:43:40,269
[SPEAKER_08]: I did the little humor thing in my live journal.

1430
01:43:43,230 --> 01:43:43,631
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway.

1431
01:43:44,771 --> 01:43:45,832
[SPEAKER_17]: Enough about YTMND.

1432
01:43:47,993 --> 01:43:49,895
[SPEAKER_17]: An enema.

1433
01:43:49,915 --> 01:43:50,135
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

1434
01:44:09,608 --> 01:44:11,889
[SPEAKER_08]: Speaking of Mark Caldwell... I had to make a Batman reference.

1435
01:44:13,410 --> 01:44:17,171
[SPEAKER_17]: Have you seen... Well, Walken was in one of the... Walken for President!

1436
01:44:17,191 --> 01:44:18,132
[SPEAKER_17]: I was just going to bring this up.

1437
01:44:18,152 --> 01:44:20,653
[SPEAKER_17]: This is this big internet site that's been going around the internet.

1438
01:44:20,673 --> 01:44:23,194
[SPEAKER_17]: Walken2008.com or .org.

1439
01:44:23,314 --> 01:44:24,055
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

1440
01:44:24,435 --> 01:44:26,576
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not going to... I'm sure it's fake.

1441
01:44:26,696 --> 01:44:28,096
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I was pretty sure it's fake.

1442
01:44:28,136 --> 01:44:31,478
[SPEAKER_08]: But the thing is, if something like that were to pass,

1443
01:44:32,045 --> 01:44:38,227
[SPEAKER_08]: First of all, you need to make sure that if they're going to, if somebody's going to run for president, put all of the issues up there first and foremost.

1444
01:44:38,247 --> 01:44:40,868
[SPEAKER_08]: That site was very, very poorly done.

1445
01:44:41,508 --> 01:44:42,388
[SPEAKER_08]: Very poorly done.

1446
01:44:42,508 --> 01:44:47,550
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, the domain register or whatever was like Lola Skates or whatever.

1447
01:44:47,970 --> 01:44:48,750
[SPEAKER_17]: Lola Skates.

1448
01:44:49,390 --> 01:44:50,471
[SPEAKER_17]: So, yeah.

1449
01:44:52,331 --> 01:44:52,731
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright.

1450
01:44:54,352 --> 01:44:57,533
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway, I think it's about time we get into the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match.

1451
01:44:57,973 --> 01:44:58,733
[SPEAKER_17]: How's that sound, kids?

1452
01:44:59,473 --> 01:45:00,734
[SPEAKER_17]: Sounds terrific.

1453
01:45:01,354 --> 01:45:01,754
[SPEAKER_08]: Why not?

1454
01:45:02,881 --> 01:45:05,342
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, so which song of mine did we use last week that won?

1455
01:45:05,362 --> 01:45:06,902
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever the first one you put in there was.

1456
01:45:07,002 --> 01:45:07,383
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1457
01:45:07,403 --> 01:45:07,843
[SPEAKER_08]: On the disc.

1458
01:45:08,063 --> 01:45:08,803
[SPEAKER_17]: I gotta remember.

1459
01:45:08,863 --> 01:45:11,204
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope, uh... We could just start over.

1460
01:45:11,924 --> 01:45:14,645
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I'm in trouble because I don't know if I remember which song it was.

1461
01:45:16,066 --> 01:45:16,786
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, let's start over.

1462
01:45:16,906 --> 01:45:18,126
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you have any idea what song it was?

1463
01:45:18,907 --> 01:45:19,507
[SPEAKER_17]: Fuck if I know.

1464
01:45:19,527 --> 01:45:20,807
[SPEAKER_17]: What are my choices?

1465
01:45:20,947 --> 01:45:23,108
[SPEAKER_17]: Shit, somebody in chat help us out.

1466
01:45:23,408 --> 01:45:24,029
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, Rob.

1467
01:45:26,429 --> 01:45:27,850
[SPEAKER_17]: You didn't like the song, I assume.

1468
01:45:28,830 --> 01:45:30,551
[SPEAKER_08]: No, because it sounded generic.

1469
01:45:31,156 --> 01:45:34,198
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I purposely put a generic one in there because I knew you'd love those ones.

1470
01:45:37,319 --> 01:45:38,180
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, this is great.

1471
01:45:38,220 --> 01:45:39,500
[SPEAKER_08]: We should do a cowbell mix.

1472
01:45:40,801 --> 01:45:43,743
[SPEAKER_17]: Was it Jet Set in the Name of Love?

1473
01:45:43,783 --> 01:45:44,323
[SPEAKER_17]: No, that wasn't it.

1474
01:45:44,363 --> 01:45:45,143
[SPEAKER_17]: I did that one earlier.

1475
01:45:47,064 --> 01:45:48,845
[SPEAKER_17]: Why don't we start with the Challengers tonight?

1476
01:45:48,865 --> 01:45:52,247
[SPEAKER_08]: That's because you use iTunes.

1477
01:45:52,647 --> 01:45:55,949
[SPEAKER_17]: I seriously don't know what song I had left in the cage match.

1478
01:45:56,269 --> 01:45:57,209
[SPEAKER_17]: So I guess we'll start over.

1479
01:45:57,970 --> 01:45:58,190
[SPEAKER_17]: Fine.

1480
01:45:59,244 --> 01:46:00,185
[SPEAKER_17]: So we'll start over tonight.

1481
01:46:00,225 --> 01:46:07,675
[SPEAKER_17]: So I gotta find a song, and while I find a song, we're gonna start off with DarkSakura's pick, because it's the only one I have ready to go.

1482
01:46:08,055 --> 01:46:10,178
[SPEAKER_17]: So DarkSakura, what did you pick tonight for tonight's game match?

1483
01:46:11,620 --> 01:46:19,949
[SPEAKER_08]: I put it in the afterbirth before, not the afterbirth, the fortune cookie.

1484
01:46:20,669 --> 01:46:24,093
[SPEAKER_08]: But I couldn't think of anything else and MC Chris is just awesome.

1485
01:46:24,133 --> 01:46:26,095
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's MC Chris with Geek.

1486
01:46:27,376 --> 01:46:31,000
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, song number one in tonight's cage match, MC Chris with Geek.

1487
01:46:31,361 --> 01:46:31,761
[SPEAKER_16]: Here it is.

1488
01:46:32,322 --> 01:46:32,542
[SPEAKER_16]: Enjoy.

1489
01:46:50,922 --> 01:47:02,731
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a geek, spread G-double-E-K, I beat my boys in the basement about every day, a card table called

1490
01:47:34,522 --> 01:48:00,211
[SPEAKER_04]: Costumes and their cops, otherwise known as the motherfuckers touch the tit If I was Wolverine, you'd hear my knockers go stick, I'm not perfect The big false picture, Peter Parker, always tripping, drop my tray in front of the girl that always fucks with I got brains, fucks, B's and C's, I got a grade point average higher than Henderson and your Z-boy Take it on me, because I'm a B, I'll take to you, you'll take to me, well one day

1491
01:48:05,407 --> 01:48:07,409
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

1492
01:48:21,243 --> 01:48:22,024
Thank you for watching!

1493
01:48:43,245 --> 01:49:03,443
[SPEAKER_04]: The Dragon died from a heart attack You may advance and you're up to armor class Being a geek, it ain't so bad I can't get laid, I got your pantomime stashed In a mind jam-packed with sci-fi facts Dread knocks, rock down a bike, kick ass Stop hanging on me I love you I'm hanging on you

1494
01:49:11,119 --> 01:49:13,460
Thank you for watching!

1495
01:49:31,753 --> 01:49:58,693
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a geek, I'm strange to you, you're strange to me Well one day, I'm gonna pack you, your brain is on the wall My face, my face is on TV, because I'm a geek I'm strange to you, you're strange to me Well one day

1496
01:50:09,406 --> 01:50:09,746
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

1497
01:50:10,606 --> 01:50:13,548
[SPEAKER_17]: Song number one in tonight's Cage Match, MC Chris with Geek.

1498
01:50:13,608 --> 01:50:19,711
[SPEAKER_17]: Remember, you guys will be voting for your favorite, and then that winner will go into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio.

1499
01:50:21,516 --> 01:50:24,959
[SPEAKER_17]: But we'll give you our opinions first and try to sway your vote.

1500
01:50:24,999 --> 01:50:27,301
[SPEAKER_17]: So, DarkSakura, it was your pick, but what did you think?

1501
01:50:27,681 --> 01:50:33,786
[SPEAKER_08]: It's MC Chris, he gets a 10, just because that song is like high school for how many people ever?

1502
01:50:34,867 --> 01:50:37,850
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the perfect description.

1503
01:50:38,710 --> 01:50:39,031
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki?

1504
01:50:40,152 --> 01:50:40,572
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess a 7.

1505
01:50:40,872 --> 01:50:42,293
[SPEAKER_14]: I just wasn't feeling it.

1506
01:50:43,775 --> 01:50:44,095
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

1507
01:50:46,362 --> 01:50:52,505
[SPEAKER_17]: For me, MC Chris is kind of one of those folks where I think the joke gets old for me.

1508
01:50:52,986 --> 01:50:54,627
[SPEAKER_17]: I think he's kind of a niche guy.

1509
01:50:54,927 --> 01:50:56,247
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't think it's a joke.

1510
01:50:56,527 --> 01:50:57,268
[SPEAKER_17]: I do, sorry.

1511
01:50:57,468 --> 01:50:57,828
[SPEAKER_17]: I give it a 6.

1512
01:50:59,629 --> 01:51:01,490
[SPEAKER_17]: Because it did have a catchy hook, I'll give it that.

1513
01:51:01,650 --> 01:51:07,093
[SPEAKER_17]: And it was, he doesn't have chicks singing in most of his songs, so that was kind of a neat little addition.

1514
01:51:08,174 --> 01:51:08,874
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, moving on.

1515
01:51:09,374 --> 01:51:10,675
[SPEAKER_17]: Loki, you want to go next or you want me to go next?

1516
01:51:12,236 --> 01:51:12,656
[SPEAKER_17]: Whatever.

1517
01:51:12,876 --> 01:51:13,496
[SPEAKER_17]: You go next then.

1518
01:51:13,536 --> 01:51:14,857
[SPEAKER_17]: What did you pick tonight?

1519
01:51:15,239 --> 01:51:17,561
[SPEAKER_17]: I picked this song from Wipeout Pure.

1520
01:51:18,582 --> 01:51:19,983
[SPEAKER_17]: Hell if I remember what it's called.

1521
01:51:20,503 --> 01:51:23,386
[SPEAKER_17]: How about, let me give you a hint, it's called Onyx by Cold Storage.

1522
01:51:23,726 --> 01:51:25,267
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, Onyx by Cold Storage.

1523
01:51:25,447 --> 01:51:29,531
[SPEAKER_17]: It's the first levels music and it's cool.

1524
01:51:29,751 --> 01:51:32,933
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's my fallback pick because I couldn't find shit.

1525
01:51:33,194 --> 01:51:34,235
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, that's always impressive.

1526
01:51:35,095 --> 01:51:37,297
[SPEAKER_17]: So, yeah, it's not bad.

1527
01:51:37,557 --> 01:51:39,058
[SPEAKER_17]: I liked it, but, you know, whatever.

1528
01:51:39,219 --> 01:51:40,880
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, here we go, song number two.

1529
01:51:42,221 --> 01:51:43,062
[SPEAKER_17]: Cold Storage with Onyx.

1530
01:52:46,048 --> 01:52:46,773
Thanks for watching!

1531
01:53:32,613 --> 01:53:33,316
Thanks for watching!

1532
01:57:10,979 --> 01:57:13,522
[SPEAKER_17]: Song number two, Cold Storage with Onyx.

1533
01:57:14,243 --> 01:57:16,805
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's see what we thought of that, DarkSakura.

1534
01:57:17,806 --> 01:57:19,208
[SPEAKER_08]: Generic, five, sorry.

1535
01:57:19,968 --> 01:57:20,329
[SPEAKER_17]: Loki.

1536
01:57:21,630 --> 01:57:24,473
[SPEAKER_17]: It gets a nine, because it's better than MC Chris.

1537
01:57:25,774 --> 01:57:29,959
[SPEAKER_17]: I also give that song a six, because I found it to be pretty generic as well, I have to say.

1538
01:57:30,379 --> 01:57:30,639
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry.

1539
01:57:33,416 --> 01:57:36,360
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, let's go to my pick, song number three tonight.

1540
01:57:36,660 --> 01:57:39,163
[SPEAKER_17]: Since I can't remember what won the cage match two weeks ago.

1541
01:57:39,183 --> 01:57:40,565
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, it was something generic.

1542
01:57:40,765 --> 01:57:43,489
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, something generic that I would have given a six anyway, so let's just...

1543
01:57:44,107 --> 01:57:45,208
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's just go to a new song.

1544
01:57:45,828 --> 01:57:47,869
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to pick this, and I hope that this isn't generic.

1545
01:57:47,909 --> 01:57:51,711
[SPEAKER_17]: I actually decided to not do a trance-type song tonight.

1546
01:57:52,031 --> 01:57:56,834
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm doing something... There's this band I absolutely love, and a lot of America loves this band too.

1547
01:57:56,874 --> 01:57:59,736
[SPEAKER_17]: It's Frow Frow, and you might remember I used to whore the cage match with these guys.

1548
01:58:01,217 --> 01:58:05,519
[SPEAKER_17]: And they had a big song that was in the movie Garden State called Let Go, and it was really big and stuff.

1549
01:58:05,799 --> 01:58:08,961
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, Imogen Heap, who's the singer, she just recently...

1550
01:58:10,186 --> 01:58:11,667
[SPEAKER_17]: I am in love with you.

1551
01:58:11,707 --> 01:58:12,007
[SPEAKER_17]: Enjoy.

1552
01:58:42,469 --> 01:59:07,387
[SPEAKER_06]: I am in love with you I am in love with you, baby I am in love with you Only for the moment Right now, another piece Right now, another piece Just like that, oh

1553
01:59:58,150 --> 01:59:59,560
Thanks for watching!

1554
02:00:57,917 --> 02:00:59,853
Thanks for watching!

1555
02:01:35,799 --> 02:01:38,381
[SPEAKER_17]: Song number three, Imogen Heap, I Am In Love With You.

1556
02:01:38,441 --> 02:01:41,184
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's see if we were in love with that or if we want to break up.

1557
02:01:41,264 --> 02:01:43,406
[SPEAKER_17]: DarkSakura.

1558
02:01:43,706 --> 02:01:48,490
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I really like her stuff, but it sounded really kind of repetitive.

1559
02:01:48,511 --> 02:01:51,293
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, a lot of her stuff sounds the same.

1560
02:01:52,554 --> 02:01:55,477
[SPEAKER_08]: It wasn't bad at all, so it gets a 7.5.

1561
02:01:56,478 --> 02:01:57,158
[SPEAKER_14]: All righty, Loki.

1562
02:01:59,260 --> 02:02:01,342
[SPEAKER_14]: It was okay.

1563
02:02:01,442 --> 02:02:01,802
[SPEAKER_14]: It gets a 7.

1564
02:02:04,142 --> 02:02:12,406
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, I have to give that song like an 8, because she does have way better songs on the CD, but unfortunately they're kind of like depressing, like emo type stuff.

1565
02:02:12,526 --> 02:02:15,188
[SPEAKER_17]: No, I don't want, well actually I shouldn't say that, because I want people to listen to this.

1566
02:02:15,688 --> 02:02:18,469
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not like garbage emo music, it's really good stuff.

1567
02:02:19,070 --> 02:02:21,111
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, garbage is cool.

1568
02:02:21,351 --> 02:02:22,291
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, like garbage is cool.

1569
02:02:22,511 --> 02:02:25,233
[SPEAKER_17]: No, but um, you know what I mean though.

1570
02:02:25,473 --> 02:02:31,416
[SPEAKER_17]: But that particular song is kind of um, it's the more upbeat one, if you could call it that, even though the lyrics are kind of depressing.

1571
02:02:32,136 --> 02:02:32,957
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, so I give it an 8.

1572
02:02:33,905 --> 02:02:40,789
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, actually no, I give it a 6, so that way I've given all three songs tonight a 6, and that's 666, so that would be cool.

1573
02:02:41,570 --> 02:02:43,831
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway, yeah I'm lame, shut up.

1574
02:02:44,371 --> 02:02:46,472
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's recap and then you guys can place your votes.

1575
02:02:46,532 --> 02:02:58,580
[SPEAKER_06]: Song number one you can vote for tonight was MC Chris with Geek.

1576
02:02:59,040 --> 02:03:02,242
[SPEAKER_15]: And song number two you can vote for tonight is Cold Storage Onyx.

1577
02:03:11,766 --> 02:03:15,088
[SPEAKER_17]: And song number three tonight, Imogen Heap, I'm In Love With You.

1578
02:03:24,853 --> 02:03:27,654
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay guys, place vote now.

1579
02:03:27,754 --> 02:03:33,417
[SPEAKER_17]: Send a private message to Sky with your vote for song number one, song number two, or song number three.

1580
02:03:34,098 --> 02:03:40,861
[SPEAKER_17]: And we will reveal those votes as soon as we have them added all up.

1581
02:03:41,423 --> 02:03:45,927
[SPEAKER_17]: Loki, this is the part of the show where I'd like to go to you for a sim scene update.

1582
02:03:46,368 --> 02:03:52,053
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, and normally I'd say I don't have anything, but I actually do, surprisingly enough.

1583
02:03:52,113 --> 02:04:00,160
[SPEAKER_17]: First thing is, Food Mix 2 finally has a goddamn date that's going to be released, and that goddamn date will be September 15th.

1584
02:04:00,661 --> 02:04:04,484
[SPEAKER_17]: And what can you expect but 50 new songs, so that's pretty awesome.

1585
02:04:05,686 --> 02:04:06,106
[SPEAKER_17]: So, yeah.

1586
02:04:06,980 --> 02:04:09,682
[SPEAKER_17]: That'll be something we'll be covering a little bit more a bit later on.

1587
02:04:10,182 --> 02:04:14,725
[SPEAKER_17]: The other thing is that TourneyMix 6 Download Pack 1 is available.

1588
02:04:14,745 --> 02:04:17,887
[SPEAKER_17]: I have not actually downloaded Download Pack 1, but it's up there.

1589
02:04:18,267 --> 02:04:23,370
[SPEAKER_17]: So if you go to ddrei.com, you can visit the last of TourneyMix.

1590
02:04:23,871 --> 02:04:25,292
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sure we're all thankful for that.

1591
02:04:26,272 --> 02:04:30,175
[SPEAKER_17]: And yeah, I think that's pretty much all I had right now.

1592
02:04:30,195 --> 02:04:31,636
[SPEAKER_17]: I know there's some other ones, but I can't remember.

1593
02:04:33,237 --> 02:04:33,497
[SPEAKER_17]: But yeah.

1594
02:04:34,904 --> 02:04:36,885
[SPEAKER_17]: So, Food Mix 2, that's pretty awesome.

1595
02:04:39,366 --> 02:04:40,246
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, super.

1596
02:04:40,406 --> 02:04:41,087
[SPEAKER_17]: Food Mix news.

1597
02:04:41,667 --> 02:04:41,927
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

1598
02:04:42,307 --> 02:04:43,668
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm excited about Food Mix 2.

1599
02:04:44,228 --> 02:04:49,370
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, see, if In The Groove was like Food Mix 2... It would be awesome.

1600
02:04:49,950 --> 02:04:51,791
[SPEAKER_17]: If Food Mix 2, that's the thing.

1601
02:04:51,871 --> 02:04:52,911
[SPEAKER_17]: It's got polish to it.

1602
02:04:53,031 --> 02:04:55,412
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, everything, it looks professional.

1603
02:04:55,452 --> 02:05:03,976
[SPEAKER_17]: It looks like, honestly, if they put it in its own game, if Konami were to go to the Food Mix guys and say, hey, make us a game, we'll publish it for you.

1604
02:05:06,388 --> 02:05:07,792
[SPEAKER_17]: It would be a DDR game.

1605
02:05:07,972 --> 02:05:08,433
[SPEAKER_17]: It would look good.

1606
02:05:13,286 --> 02:05:16,268
[SPEAKER_17]: I want to mention this because we hadn't really gotten a chance to yet.

1607
02:05:16,608 --> 02:05:17,909
[SPEAKER_17]: Actually, there's a couple things I want to talk about.

1608
02:05:17,949 --> 02:05:19,530
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's go to this.

1609
02:05:20,270 --> 02:05:23,812
[SPEAKER_17]: This is a story about the Pump It Up US song list.

1610
02:05:24,153 --> 02:05:27,895
[SPEAKER_17]: Apparently, some folks are actually already getting a hold of this game somehow.

1611
02:05:27,935 --> 02:05:30,917
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's because they're in the industry, so they know people that know people.

1612
02:05:31,177 --> 02:05:36,761
[SPEAKER_17]: But for the rest of us, we get it on the 31st of this month, I want to say, is when Pump It Up comes out.

1613
02:05:37,101 --> 02:05:37,581
[SPEAKER_17]: Get this.

1614
02:05:38,842 --> 02:05:40,263
[SPEAKER_17]: 101 songs on the song list.

1615
02:05:40,748 --> 02:05:42,348
[SPEAKER_17]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1616
02:06:06,756 --> 02:06:07,056
[SPEAKER_17]: U.S.

1617
02:06:07,377 --> 02:06:21,770
[SPEAKER_17]: Known Songs, Name of the Game, Crystal Method, Walkie Talkie Man, Stereogram, I Love You Baby, Pandera, Let's Groove, Earth, Wind & Fire, Little Less Conversation, and Rapper's Delight by the Sugarhill Gang.

1618
02:06:27,615 --> 02:06:30,156
[SPEAKER_17]: Also some K-pop coming over, which I think is kind of cool.

1619
02:06:30,877 --> 02:06:32,037
[SPEAKER_17]: Just a whole lot of other songs.

1620
02:06:32,157 --> 02:06:34,718
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm just kind of scanning through the list, seeing what I can find in here.

1621
02:06:38,400 --> 02:06:41,241
[SPEAKER_17]: Come to Me and Funky Tonight by Klon, of course, are coming over.

1622
02:06:42,462 --> 02:06:46,764
[SPEAKER_17]: Empire of the Sun, Nova Sonic, Boa, Valenti.

1623
02:06:48,445 --> 02:06:49,845
[SPEAKER_17]: Boa, that's cool.

1624
02:06:49,965 --> 02:06:51,266
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I thought that was pretty cool, too.

1625
02:06:53,507 --> 02:06:55,508
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's see, what else is on here that I recognize?

1626
02:06:56,548 --> 02:06:57,609
[SPEAKER_17]: Shake It Up by Rod.

1627
02:06:57,969 --> 02:07:07,133
[SPEAKER_17]: So, you know what guys, just head on over to Beat, or I'm sorry, either BomaniStyle.com has the list, or there's actually a thread in the DDRUK forum as well that both have the list.

1628
02:07:07,734 --> 02:07:08,214
[SPEAKER_17]: Check it out.

1629
02:07:09,475 --> 02:07:16,518
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm actually, you know, even though I said earlier in the show, I actually prefer Intergroup to Pump It Up because I don't like Pump It Up's interface, I still want to give the home version a shot.

1630
02:07:16,558 --> 02:07:22,221
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it might be fun to play at home, and especially with like 101 freaking songs, that's going to be hard to wear out.

1631
02:07:22,281 --> 02:07:23,682
[SPEAKER_17]: So I definitely will check this game out.

1632
02:07:24,150 --> 02:07:24,991
[SPEAKER_17]: and let you know what I think.

1633
02:07:25,391 --> 02:07:27,013
[SPEAKER_17]: I wish I could have gotten an advance copy.

1634
02:07:29,796 --> 02:07:30,116
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright.

1635
02:07:33,880 --> 02:07:39,286
[SPEAKER_17]: So, um, speaking of Pump It Up, we're working on some little extra news we might have on that for a little later in the show.

1636
02:07:39,306 --> 02:07:41,928
[SPEAKER_17]: Also, we gotta talk about DDR with fire.

1637
02:07:43,490 --> 02:07:44,451
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, um,

1638
02:07:45,612 --> 02:07:48,753
[SPEAKER_17]: Dance Dance Emulation, we talked about it a while back.

1639
02:07:48,833 --> 02:07:52,134
[SPEAKER_17]: There was going to be a Burning Man and this fire festival that's in Oakland.

1640
02:07:53,074 --> 02:07:54,315
[SPEAKER_17]: I was just about to get to this, yes.

1641
02:07:54,615 --> 02:07:58,116
[SPEAKER_17]: I've been teasing it like the whole show and now I'm finally getting to it, but that's alright.

1642
02:08:00,117 --> 02:08:02,577
[SPEAKER_17]: It looks awesome from what I've seen gameplay-wise.

1643
02:08:02,937 --> 02:08:10,360
[SPEAKER_17]: It had a lot of hardware trouble though because I guess the pads broke, the thing crashed, all that type of thing.

1644
02:08:10,620 --> 02:08:14,641
[SPEAKER_17]: But I got to see, there's a little bit of footage on the website actually that shows

1645
02:08:15,310 --> 02:08:26,397
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, actually DDR Freak posted a video about this, and I wanted to show this, if I could get to it, so we could have a little bit of movie nights.

1646
02:08:26,537 --> 02:08:28,358
[SPEAKER_17]: And now, oh darn it, I can't find the video.

1647
02:08:28,738 --> 02:08:31,860
[SPEAKER_17]: Let me, I can bring it up again real fast here.

1648
02:08:32,380 --> 02:08:35,162
[SPEAKER_17]: So you actually watched the video, Loki, of this?

1649
02:08:35,282 --> 02:08:35,482
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1650
02:08:36,082 --> 02:08:36,623
[SPEAKER_17]: And what did you think?

1651
02:08:36,643 --> 02:08:37,743
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, it was interesting.

1652
02:08:37,963 --> 02:08:41,926
[SPEAKER_17]: The guy in the suit reminded me of the Bunnymen from the Intel commercials.

1653
02:08:42,066 --> 02:08:42,386
[SPEAKER_17]: But, uh,

1654
02:08:43,354 --> 02:08:44,674
[SPEAKER_17]: It was an interesting idea.

1655
02:08:44,914 --> 02:08:53,156
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know, it's just one of those Burning Man things, because they've got a lot of weird things that they do at Burning Man, and that would be one of them.

1656
02:08:54,656 --> 02:08:55,816
[SPEAKER_17]: You crazy kids.

1657
02:08:56,236 --> 02:08:57,197
[SPEAKER_17]: It looks interesting.

1658
02:08:58,097 --> 02:09:00,417
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

1659
02:09:00,437 --> 02:09:01,057
[SPEAKER_17]: Let me see, let me see.

1660
02:09:01,277 --> 02:09:03,018
[SPEAKER_17]: Because, Jamie, you probably haven't seen this yet, right?

1661
02:09:03,698 --> 02:09:04,458
[SPEAKER_18]: Probably not.

1662
02:09:04,478 --> 02:09:05,298
[SPEAKER_17]: Let me show this to you here.

1663
02:09:06,118 --> 02:09:06,878
[SPEAKER_18]: I can't see through you.

1664
02:09:07,018 --> 02:09:07,919
[SPEAKER_18]: Hold on, I'm going to move.

1665
02:09:07,939 --> 02:09:09,039
[SPEAKER_17]: I've just got to open this up first.

1666
02:09:09,059 --> 02:09:10,019
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, here it comes.

1667
02:09:11,914 --> 02:09:13,015
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, wait, we need some music.

1668
02:09:13,155 --> 02:09:13,655
[SPEAKER_17]: We need some music.

1669
02:09:13,715 --> 02:09:13,955
[SPEAKER_17]: Hold on.

1670
02:09:14,035 --> 02:09:14,616
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, I have.

1671
02:09:15,116 --> 02:09:15,416
[SPEAKER_17]: Did you?

1672
02:09:15,496 --> 02:09:16,076
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, here it is again.

1673
02:09:20,199 --> 02:09:21,480
[SPEAKER_17]: Playing a little After the Game of Love.

1674
02:09:22,160 --> 02:09:23,541
[SPEAKER_17]: Then, whoosh, fire!

1675
02:09:25,862 --> 02:09:27,043
[SPEAKER_17]: Whoosh, fire!

1676
02:09:28,284 --> 02:09:30,585
[SPEAKER_17]: Yep, that's pretty much Dance to Assimilation.

1677
02:09:30,665 --> 02:09:31,566
[SPEAKER_17]: Whoosh, fire!

1678
02:09:32,046 --> 02:09:32,966
[SPEAKER_17]: Hey, fire is cool.

1679
02:09:32,986 --> 02:09:34,387
[SPEAKER_17]: DDR whoosh fire mix.

1680
02:09:38,770 --> 02:09:38,810
[SPEAKER_17]: Um...

1681
02:09:42,095 --> 02:09:42,575
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll say it.

1682
02:09:42,716 --> 02:09:43,596
[SPEAKER_17]: What a stupid idea.

1683
02:09:44,756 --> 02:09:45,416
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sorry.

1684
02:09:46,277 --> 02:09:50,238
[SPEAKER_08]: Now if he really caught on fire and was dancing on fire, that might be cool.

1685
02:09:50,278 --> 02:09:55,479
[SPEAKER_17]: This is somebody's inside joke gone like way, way, way too far.

1686
02:09:55,539 --> 02:10:00,621
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm just waiting for someone to set themselves on fire because they saw him and they blame it on dancing.

1687
02:10:00,661 --> 02:10:08,723
[SPEAKER_17]: I love it because on the DDR Freak story it says, you know, it links to the article and everything and it says, note, we urge you not to try this at home.

1688
02:10:09,024 --> 02:10:10,184
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, like, you know what?

1689
02:10:10,973 --> 02:10:12,153
[SPEAKER_17]: Don't even put the disclaimer.

1690
02:10:12,253 --> 02:10:13,354
[SPEAKER_17]: Let somebody try it at home.

1691
02:10:13,414 --> 02:10:14,394
[SPEAKER_17]: That's Darwinism, kids.

1692
02:10:15,034 --> 02:10:15,614
[SPEAKER_17]: No, it's all good.

1693
02:10:19,415 --> 02:10:19,755
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

1694
02:10:19,815 --> 02:10:22,776
[SPEAKER_08]: I want someone to try it at home so I can submit their story to the Darwin Awards.

1695
02:10:24,936 --> 02:10:30,798
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't get it because everybody's talking about this sensation of being blasted with fire and all this stuff.

1696
02:10:30,838 --> 02:10:33,478
[SPEAKER_17]: Or you can feel the sensation of being blasted with fire.

1697
02:10:33,538 --> 02:10:37,619
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, A. If you want to feel the sensation of being blasted with fire, become a firefighter.

1698
02:10:38,040 --> 02:10:39,740
[SPEAKER_17]: B. If that's not for you or whatever...

1699
02:10:40,882 --> 02:10:45,803
[SPEAKER_17]: Because you're wearing all these protective gear, I mean, I understand that there's that heat sensation or something.

1700
02:10:46,063 --> 02:10:49,224
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm just knocking on this, I guess, because it's not something I would ever really want to do.

1701
02:10:49,504 --> 02:10:50,724
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm just not interested in it.

1702
02:10:50,864 --> 02:10:56,685
[SPEAKER_17]: Like, I'm also not, you know, just like, I don't really want to visit Central Mexico.

1703
02:10:56,986 --> 02:10:58,066
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm not going to do it, ever.

1704
02:10:58,446 --> 02:11:00,746
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't really want to play Dance Dance Simulation.

1705
02:11:00,766 --> 02:11:02,127
[SPEAKER_17]: Go out and get laid!

1706
02:11:02,147 --> 02:11:06,048
[SPEAKER_17]: There are more things better than fire being blasted in your face.

1707
02:11:06,828 --> 02:11:07,928
[SPEAKER_17]: Like a good woman.

1708
02:11:10,509 --> 02:11:11,970
[SPEAKER_17]: Go get laid, honestly.

1709
02:11:12,030 --> 02:11:13,490
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what you need to do.

1710
02:11:13,510 --> 02:11:15,111
[SPEAKER_17]: I think a woman co-designed this game.

1711
02:11:16,011 --> 02:11:17,812
[SPEAKER_08]: Some prostitutes are cheaper than DDR.

1712
02:11:17,852 --> 02:11:19,893
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm surprised the whole set up didn't blow up then.

1713
02:11:21,814 --> 02:11:22,354
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoa!

1714
02:11:22,815 --> 02:11:25,616
[SPEAKER_17]: Whoa, did you hear that joke you just made?

1715
02:11:25,956 --> 02:11:26,576
[SPEAKER_08]: Excuse me?

1716
02:11:27,176 --> 02:11:28,137
[SPEAKER_08]: Repeat thyself?

1717
02:11:28,877 --> 02:11:30,478
[SPEAKER_17]: You should have listened in the first place.

1718
02:11:31,084 --> 02:11:32,865
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1719
02:11:33,205 --> 02:11:39,009
[SPEAKER_17]: If you want to hear that joke, you can tune in to the rewinds that we have on DVR Freak Radio.

1720
02:11:39,289 --> 02:11:44,393
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, we would be able to listen to it if someone would remember to upload it to DVR Freak's server.

1721
02:11:44,733 --> 02:11:48,695
[SPEAKER_17]: I've been out a couple weeks, and we will get back in the swing of those very soon.

1722
02:11:49,076 --> 02:11:50,396
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they're playing one from a month ago.

1723
02:11:51,497 --> 02:11:53,478
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to shangle you with the mic cord now.

1724
02:12:19,619 --> 02:12:21,180
[SPEAKER_08]: From now on, Loki will be a ghost.

1725
02:12:21,480 --> 02:12:22,881
[SPEAKER_08]: He will be here in spirit only.

1726
02:12:24,102 --> 02:12:25,022
[SPEAKER_08]: When I get around to it.

1727
02:12:27,844 --> 02:12:29,265
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyways, no.

1728
02:12:30,305 --> 02:12:32,887
[SPEAKER_17]: But see, at Burning Man, if it blew up, it'd be good.

1729
02:12:33,728 --> 02:12:34,068
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know.

1730
02:12:35,489 --> 02:12:35,949
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, man.

1731
02:12:36,669 --> 02:12:37,010
[SPEAKER_17]: Why?

1732
02:12:39,111 --> 02:12:39,411
[SPEAKER_17]: Why?

1733
02:12:39,891 --> 02:12:40,211
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know.

1734
02:12:40,652 --> 02:12:40,892
[SPEAKER_17]: I just...

1735
02:12:44,344 --> 02:12:49,367
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't feel like you're really feeling the sensation of fire because you're wearing a protective suit all over.

1736
02:12:49,507 --> 02:12:52,109
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's like it kind of takes away from that.

1737
02:12:52,149 --> 02:12:54,490
[SPEAKER_17]: It's like, feel like what it's like to get shot.

1738
02:12:54,550 --> 02:12:56,672
[SPEAKER_17]: Here's a bulletproof vest, you know?

1739
02:12:58,393 --> 02:13:07,698
[SPEAKER_17]: And you know somebody's going to come up with this, like, dance, dance, you know, South Central, where you've got to dodge the bullets that get shot at you if you miss a step.

1740
02:13:07,718 --> 02:13:10,420
[SPEAKER_17]: Feel what it's like to get married and get kicked in the nuts.

1741
02:13:14,645 --> 02:13:15,405
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't appreciate that.

1742
02:13:15,705 --> 02:13:17,766
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, you two are the ones getting married in this next year.

1743
02:13:17,826 --> 02:13:18,846
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not, so whatever.

1744
02:13:20,426 --> 02:13:20,827
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright.

1745
02:13:24,287 --> 02:13:25,228
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to go to a break.

1746
02:13:25,868 --> 02:13:28,088
[SPEAKER_17]: When we come back from the break, more stuff.

1747
02:13:28,288 --> 02:13:29,749
[SPEAKER_17]: Also, tonight's cage match winner.

1748
02:13:30,329 --> 02:13:35,530
[SPEAKER_17]: I haven't even started looking at the votes yet, so we'll get to all that when we come back after a quick break.

1749
02:13:36,210 --> 02:13:39,191
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think I have the appropriate song to start us off this break.

1750
02:13:39,391 --> 02:13:42,752
[SPEAKER_17]: So we'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.

1751
02:14:13,570 --> 02:14:14,491
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright!

1752
02:14:14,511 --> 02:14:15,231
[SPEAKER_06]: Y'all put them in!

1753
02:14:15,252 --> 02:14:16,092
[SPEAKER_06]: Get the pressure!

1754
02:14:16,172 --> 02:14:18,294
[SPEAKER_06]: You've had the time to rest!

1755
02:14:18,314 --> 02:14:19,215
Which is coming to an end!

1756
02:14:19,235 --> 02:14:20,155
And we start again!

1757
02:14:20,236 --> 02:14:21,216
One, two, three, FIRE!

1758
02:15:17,779 --> 02:15:18,660
Happy New Year!

1759
02:15:18,740 --> 02:15:19,641
Happy New Year!

1760
02:15:19,701 --> 02:15:21,543
Happy New Year, everybody!

1761
02:15:21,603 --> 02:15:22,524
Happy New Year!

1762
02:15:22,564 --> 02:15:23,465
Happy New Year!

1763
02:15:23,505 --> 02:15:24,346
Happy New Year!

1764
02:15:24,366 --> 02:15:25,047
Happy New Year!

1765
02:16:02,296 --> 02:16:20,172
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel you, I feel you, I feel you every way I feel you, I feel you, I say to you every night I feel you, I feel you, I feel you every way I feel you, I feel you, I feel you every way I feel you, I feel you, I feel you every way I feel you, I feel you, I say to you every night

1766
02:16:37,791 --> 02:16:45,894
I see you, I see you, I see you every wedding I see you, I see you, I say to you every day I see you, I see you, I say to you every day I see you

1767
02:17:02,532 --> 02:17:03,253
Thank you for watching!

1768
02:18:29,834 --> 02:18:42,003
I'm living through the mist of love to find the place my heart belongs I'm living through the mist of love to find my place my home

1769
02:19:59,225 --> 02:20:01,086
[SPEAKER_06]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, DJ Ranma

1770
02:20:46,693 --> 02:20:52,897
Orange Lounge Radio Mamani Music and more Howdy kids, welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio

1771
02:21:14,984 --> 02:21:30,129
[SPEAKER_17]: and in that break you heard some Fire from Disney's Rave, Happy Wedding from 2DX7Style, Lion Musashi with Thunder from 2DX8, and DJ Doc with Pump It Up, I'm sorry, with Run To You from Pump It Up.

1772
02:21:30,189 --> 02:21:31,109
[SPEAKER_17]: I read it backwards, sorry.

1773
02:21:33,170 --> 02:21:33,610
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway, I want...

1774
02:21:35,756 --> 02:21:40,219
[SPEAKER_08]: We did that at karaoke on the E3 trip.

1775
02:21:40,379 --> 02:21:40,759
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

1776
02:21:42,120 --> 02:21:46,363
[SPEAKER_08]: Run to you, because we went to a Korean karaoke bar.

1777
02:21:46,783 --> 02:21:48,104
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, you went to a Korean karaoke bar.

1778
02:21:48,204 --> 02:21:53,607
[SPEAKER_17]: I remember the Korean arcade at Cyber Beat, but you didn't go to Cyber Beat, did you?

1779
02:21:53,767 --> 02:21:56,949
[SPEAKER_08]: No, but we went to a Korean karaoke place.

1780
02:21:57,570 --> 02:22:00,992
[SPEAKER_08]: And actually, I did a song off the Japanese list, but it was all in English.

1781
02:22:01,032 --> 02:22:02,213
[SPEAKER_08]: It was Boa.

1782
02:22:02,933 --> 02:22:03,033
[SPEAKER_17]: Ah.

1783
02:22:03,994 --> 02:22:04,014
[SPEAKER_17]: I...

1784
02:22:04,997 --> 02:22:09,200
[SPEAKER_17]: Can't forget at the Korean Arcade, the Cyber Zone, I think it's called.

1785
02:22:09,240 --> 02:22:10,100
[SPEAKER_17]: I hope it's still around.

1786
02:22:10,120 --> 02:22:10,961
[SPEAKER_17]: It was a cute little place.

1787
02:22:11,601 --> 02:22:12,882
[SPEAKER_17]: Where they were having this tournament.

1788
02:22:12,902 --> 02:22:14,443
[SPEAKER_17]: They had karaoke booths in the back.

1789
02:22:14,763 --> 02:22:18,345
[SPEAKER_17]: But it was the kind of thing where you'd lock yourself in and you'd put in a couple tokens and you could sing a song.

1790
02:22:18,725 --> 02:22:21,587
[SPEAKER_17]: And I swear to God, Rice Princess and I were in there the entire tournament.

1791
02:22:21,607 --> 02:22:23,948
[SPEAKER_17]: We probably missed the whole tournament thanks to those karaoke rooms.

1792
02:22:24,209 --> 02:22:27,130
[SPEAKER_17]: I was singing Cyndi Lauper and I was singing, you know, just everything.

1793
02:22:27,370 --> 02:22:27,691
[SPEAKER_17]: Everything.

1794
02:22:28,111 --> 02:22:28,451
[SPEAKER_17]: It was fun.

1795
02:22:28,491 --> 02:22:31,453
[SPEAKER_17]: And it would grade you when you were done, which I thought was kind of weird.

1796
02:22:31,673 --> 02:22:38,777
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, yeah, but that's like almost typical of just about every other karaoke thing I've done except for the ones like where we normally go to karaoke.

1797
02:22:39,017 --> 02:22:39,237
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

1798
02:22:41,419 --> 02:22:43,900
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway, I actually wanted to mention something about Pump It Up.

1799
02:22:44,020 --> 02:22:46,401
[SPEAKER_17]: We actually have a little bit of an exclusive here.

1800
02:22:46,721 --> 02:22:48,963
[SPEAKER_17]: So we have a tip from our buddy Maple.

1801
02:22:50,824 --> 02:22:56,347
[SPEAKER_17]: He's sharing this with us so that we can tell you guys that Banya, with the song...

1802
02:22:57,000 --> 02:22:59,442
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm going to fuck up the pronunciation of this.

1803
02:22:59,802 --> 02:23:03,584
[SPEAKER_17]: Ni-sance, N-A-I-S-S-A-N-C-E, Ni-sance.

1804
02:23:04,485 --> 02:23:05,365
[SPEAKER_17]: Ni-sance, I don't know.

1805
02:23:05,765 --> 02:23:06,226
[SPEAKER_08]: Ni-sance.

1806
02:23:06,486 --> 02:23:06,946
[SPEAKER_17]: Ni-sance.

1807
02:23:07,486 --> 02:23:12,970
[SPEAKER_17]: This song will actually be unlocked in survival mode in Pump It Up.

1808
02:23:13,290 --> 02:23:15,912
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's not on any of the song lists that are already out there.

1809
02:23:15,992 --> 02:23:17,112
[SPEAKER_14]: So go figure.

1810
02:23:18,712 --> 02:23:22,373
[SPEAKER_17]: If you didn't know, the way that Pump It Up, the home version works, it's got like different modes.

1811
02:23:22,793 --> 02:23:24,913
[SPEAKER_17]: Home mode has no life bars in it.

1812
02:23:25,393 --> 02:23:27,494
[SPEAKER_17]: The arcade mode is like the arcade.

1813
02:23:27,794 --> 02:23:31,055
[SPEAKER_17]: But survival mode, when your life bar runs out, you lose.

1814
02:23:31,355 --> 02:23:34,295
[SPEAKER_17]: So there's these different modes you can play that kind of alter the life mode.

1815
02:23:34,335 --> 02:23:35,216
[SPEAKER_17]: Am I playing the right way?

1816
02:23:35,336 --> 02:23:36,816
[SPEAKER_17]: You will get this new Bonnie song.

1817
02:23:37,116 --> 02:23:37,536
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

1818
02:23:37,636 --> 02:23:42,797
[SPEAKER_08]: If I was any good at Pump It Up, I think I would dig the one that doesn't have a life bar.

1819
02:23:42,817 --> 02:23:43,838
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

1820
02:23:43,978 --> 02:23:45,638
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to... I'm going to...

1821
02:23:47,389 --> 02:23:47,949
[SPEAKER_17]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1822
02:24:17,891 --> 02:24:20,213
[SPEAKER_17]: Something else I wanted to share with you guys, an anonymous tip from the chat room.

1823
02:24:20,233 --> 02:24:21,854
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, not so much an anonymous tip, actually.

1824
02:24:21,894 --> 02:24:26,196
[SPEAKER_17]: This came to us from, I believe, Dark Knight sent this over to me, and if I messed that up, I'm very sorry.

1825
02:24:26,897 --> 02:24:37,403
[SPEAKER_17]: This was a link on IGN.com, actually, that talks about a preview for a new Nintendo DS music game from the people that made Guitar Man.

1826
02:24:38,384 --> 02:24:38,824
[SPEAKER_17]: Osu!

1827
02:24:38,904 --> 02:24:39,584
[SPEAKER_17]: Tatake!

1828
02:24:40,705 --> 02:24:41,285
[SPEAKER_17]: Oendan!

1829
02:24:41,726 --> 02:24:42,946
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me see, let me see, let me see.

1830
02:24:42,966 --> 02:24:43,967
[SPEAKER_08]: Excuse me, I'm using the laptop.

1831
02:24:45,154 --> 02:24:46,195
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I saw that one.

1832
02:24:46,255 --> 02:24:47,135
[SPEAKER_17]: It's weird looking.

1833
02:24:47,235 --> 02:24:48,977
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, how so, Loki?

1834
02:24:50,498 --> 02:24:51,518
[SPEAKER_17]: It looks like... Tatakai.

1835
02:24:52,719 --> 02:24:54,060
[SPEAKER_08]: Tatakai means fight.

1836
02:24:54,840 --> 02:24:58,443
[SPEAKER_08]: Oendan, I'm not quite sure, but it means, hey, fight something.

1837
02:24:58,903 --> 02:24:59,683
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

1838
02:25:00,184 --> 02:25:07,168
[SPEAKER_17]: It looks funny because there's like these three guys dancing and stuff, and there's this guy that looks like yelling at them, and I don't really know what that was.

1839
02:25:07,569 --> 02:25:09,710
[SPEAKER_17]: I was just based off the pictures that I saw in there.

1840
02:25:10,993 --> 02:25:11,493
[SPEAKER_17]: Interesting.

1841
02:25:12,474 --> 02:25:24,966
[SPEAKER_17]: Basically, it involves three soldier-type guys that are going around the town, and they motivate people with manly poses, but it's up to the player to control just how well that they can motivate.

1842
02:25:25,347 --> 02:25:32,214
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's kind of like a follow-the-pattern-type challenge, and it matches the beat of the song that's being played, of course, using the touchscreen.

1843
02:25:32,774 --> 02:25:40,738
[SPEAKER_08]: During the song, a series of numbered circles pop up on screen as the player is tasked to tap the circle to the rhythm of the song.

1844
02:25:47,822 --> 02:25:48,503
[SPEAKER_17]: TechnicBeat is confusing.

1845
02:26:03,405 --> 02:26:06,087
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, but this song sounds like it's just you tap on the right circles.

1846
02:26:06,147 --> 02:26:07,608
[SPEAKER_17]: So that should be interesting there.

1847
02:26:08,508 --> 02:26:09,249
[SPEAKER_17]: But that's not it.

1848
02:26:09,449 --> 02:26:12,651
[SPEAKER_17]: There's also pathways in the game where you don't just tap.

1849
02:26:12,911 --> 02:26:14,432
[SPEAKER_17]: They're a little bit longer of a beat.

1850
02:26:14,492 --> 02:26:17,954
[SPEAKER_17]: You have to tap and drag your stylus to the beat.

1851
02:26:19,115 --> 02:26:22,577
[SPEAKER_17]: It's like a virtual volleyball, one end of the path to another and back again.

1852
02:26:22,977 --> 02:26:25,639
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's kind of the guitar-managed part of it.

1853
02:26:25,679 --> 02:26:26,880
[SPEAKER_17]: That should be very interesting.

1854
02:26:27,140 --> 02:26:28,361
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob, spell that last one for me.

1855
02:26:28,601 --> 02:26:30,422
[SPEAKER_08]: O-U-E-N-D-A-N?

1856
02:26:31,189 --> 02:26:32,490
[SPEAKER_17]: O-U-E-N-D-A-N, yes.

1857
02:26:32,810 --> 02:26:33,931
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I'm going to see what that means.

1858
02:26:33,951 --> 02:26:34,592
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright.

1859
02:26:35,513 --> 02:26:35,873
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1860
02:26:37,354 --> 02:26:40,637
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, let's get to tonight's cage match winner, boys and girls.

1861
02:26:40,697 --> 02:26:42,118
[SPEAKER_17]: I know you've been waiting a while to hear it.

1862
02:26:42,158 --> 02:26:45,461
[SPEAKER_17]: Tonight's cage match winner was won by one vote.

1863
02:26:45,501 --> 02:26:47,883
[SPEAKER_17]: And I have to say tonight, kids, not a lot of votes tonight.

1864
02:26:48,303 --> 02:26:49,764
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm very pissed at your apathy.

1865
02:26:51,145 --> 02:26:52,827
[SPEAKER_17]: But for those of you guys that did vote, thank you.

1866
02:26:52,847 --> 02:26:53,647
[SPEAKER_08]: They're being too emo.

1867
02:26:53,867 --> 02:26:54,708
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I guess so.

1868
02:26:54,788 --> 02:26:57,050
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe they were too wrapped up in the emo chick song.

1869
02:26:57,390 --> 02:26:59,072
[SPEAKER_17]: Unfortunately, that's not the song that won tonight.

1870
02:26:59,092 --> 02:27:00,052
[SPEAKER_17]: The song that won tonight was...

1871
02:27:02,407 --> 02:27:06,411
[SPEAKER_17]: Onyx by Cold Storage with one vote over MC Chris.

1872
02:27:07,632 --> 02:27:08,032
[SPEAKER_17]: Sadness.

1873
02:27:08,692 --> 02:27:09,593
[SPEAKER_08]: Hooray for generic.

1874
02:27:11,034 --> 02:27:12,536
[SPEAKER_17]: Hey, I don't have to pick a song next week.

1875
02:27:13,256 --> 02:27:14,818
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, rub it in.

1876
02:27:15,038 --> 02:27:15,578
[SPEAKER_17]: Rub it in.

1877
02:27:16,499 --> 02:27:20,963
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, and to those of you guys... I think, though... To those of you guys who didn't vote, poop on you.

1878
02:27:21,163 --> 02:27:26,868
[SPEAKER_08]: I think going into that, though, I think that it's highly appropriate to have, uh... You know...

1879
02:27:27,501 --> 02:27:28,161
[SPEAKER_17]: DarkSakura

1880
02:27:51,883 --> 02:27:54,424
[SPEAKER_08]: I've never put that in there for you since you never seem to be able to find it.

1881
02:27:54,505 --> 02:27:55,465
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, I appreciate that.

1882
02:27:55,485 --> 02:27:57,326
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to have to do this next week.

1883
02:27:57,426 --> 02:28:02,229
[SPEAKER_17]: I have some funny music that you can use for game show stuff.

1884
02:28:02,789 --> 02:28:04,850
[SPEAKER_17]: I put it on my card especially for you guys.

1885
02:28:04,890 --> 02:28:06,111
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sorry, this isn't about ranting.

1886
02:28:07,116 --> 02:28:08,857
[SPEAKER_17]: Fight, Kill, Blood Makes Grass Grow

1887
02:28:31,172 --> 02:28:35,674
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, that used to be our homecoming chant every year because our rival school for homecoming was McGill.

1888
02:28:36,254 --> 02:28:37,214
[SPEAKER_08]: So it was Kill McGill.

1889
02:28:38,395 --> 02:28:39,295
[SPEAKER_08]: Blood makes the grass grow.

1890
02:28:40,035 --> 02:28:41,736
[SPEAKER_17]: This used to be our cheer.

1891
02:28:42,356 --> 02:28:44,056
[SPEAKER_17]: And this kind of ties into the next segment here.

1892
02:28:44,076 --> 02:28:45,597
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'll kick it off with a little cheer.

1893
02:28:45,617 --> 02:28:47,077
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to kick off tonight's FU's with a little cheer.

1894
02:28:47,097 --> 02:28:47,938
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to be our cheerleader.

1895
02:28:47,958 --> 02:28:48,338
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, I am.

1896
02:28:48,378 --> 02:28:48,898
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, ready?

1897
02:28:48,918 --> 02:28:50,038
[SPEAKER_03]: Has it already been broughten?

1898
02:28:50,499 --> 02:28:52,379
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, I'm broughtening it right now.

1899
02:28:52,719 --> 02:28:54,120
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, give me a cue.

1900
02:28:55,180 --> 02:28:55,640
[SPEAKER_17]: Cue.

1901
02:28:55,800 --> 02:28:56,661
[SPEAKER_17]: Give me a cue.

1902
02:28:56,861 --> 02:28:57,261
[SPEAKER_14]: Cue.

1903
02:28:57,441 --> 02:28:58,261
[SPEAKER_18]: Give me a cue.

1904
02:28:58,341 --> 02:28:58,601
[SPEAKER_18]: Cue.

1905
02:28:58,822 --> 02:28:59,622
[SPEAKER_18]: Give me a cue.

1906
02:28:59,802 --> 02:29:00,202
[SPEAKER_08]: Shut up.

1907
02:29:01,041 --> 02:29:01,922
[SPEAKER_18]: What's that spell?

1908
02:29:02,762 --> 02:29:03,363
[SPEAKER_18]: 4Q!

1909
02:29:04,503 --> 02:29:04,904
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

1910
02:29:04,924 --> 02:29:05,324
[SPEAKER_08]: We had one.

1911
02:29:05,704 --> 02:29:05,944
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob.

1912
02:29:06,164 --> 02:29:06,364
[SPEAKER_17]: What?

1913
02:29:06,485 --> 02:29:10,587
[SPEAKER_08]: Give me B. B. Give me another B. B. Give me another B. B. What's that spell?

1914
02:29:10,947 --> 02:29:11,107
[SPEAKER_17]: 3B?

1915
02:29:13,809 --> 02:29:15,610
[SPEAKER_15]: You're retarded.

1916
02:29:15,630 --> 02:29:17,732
[SPEAKER_08]: That was a band cheer, okay?

1917
02:29:17,912 --> 02:29:19,733
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, why are we doing the 4Q of the week?

1918
02:29:20,634 --> 02:29:22,615
[SPEAKER_08]: Because we're full of emo.

1919
02:29:31,807 --> 02:29:32,567
[SPEAKER_08]: My first F.U.

1920
02:29:32,607 --> 02:29:34,107
[SPEAKER_08]: goes to people who like generic crap.

1921
02:29:36,368 --> 02:29:37,108
[SPEAKER_08]: My second F.U.

1922
02:29:37,708 --> 02:29:52,092
[SPEAKER_08]: of the week goes towards just being given random assignments at work and then having to go back and do everybody else's stuff because certain people decided not to come into work that day and aren't going to be in the next week.

1923
02:29:52,132 --> 02:29:53,313
[SPEAKER_08]: So I get to do it again, yay!

1924
02:29:55,994 --> 02:29:56,234
[SPEAKER_08]: F.U.

1925
02:29:56,294 --> 02:29:57,054
[SPEAKER_08]: goes toward...

1926
02:29:58,815 --> 02:30:06,341
[SPEAKER_08]: Having to basically do a lot of the wedding crap on my own, although I've been getting a bit more support as of late.

1927
02:30:06,942 --> 02:30:15,769
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's not really that I'm doing it on my own, it's just that there's certain things about it that are more important to me than they are to the other party in my wedding.

1928
02:30:16,170 --> 02:30:18,471
[SPEAKER_15]: You guys should do a reality show about my wedding.

1929
02:30:18,492 --> 02:30:18,532
[SPEAKER_15]: No!

1930
02:30:18,852 --> 02:30:20,233
[SPEAKER_08]: Hell no, okay?

1931
02:30:20,293 --> 02:30:20,833
[SPEAKER_08]: Hell no.

1932
02:30:21,114 --> 02:30:23,135
[SPEAKER_08]: This is close enough to reality.

1933
02:30:23,936 --> 02:30:24,917
[SPEAKER_08]: More like unreality.

1934
02:30:27,913 --> 02:30:40,782
[SPEAKER_08]: Another SU goes toward the fact that Dan lent our Xbox out to his friend and I've been sort of having the urge to play Halo 2 even though I get sickening... I get motion sick on that game.

1935
02:30:41,402 --> 02:30:46,006
[SPEAKER_08]: But I want to go back to the Earth level and run all over the rooftops.

1936
02:30:49,881 --> 02:30:52,063
[SPEAKER_08]: and, uh, another F.U.

1937
02:30:52,103 --> 02:30:56,546
[SPEAKER_08]: goes to my puppy demo for only being five minutes long, because I love playing Frisbee with puppies.

1938
02:30:58,007 --> 02:30:59,088
[SPEAKER_17]: You don't have much longer to wait.

1939
02:31:01,830 --> 02:31:04,431
[SPEAKER_17]: And, uh, what the... Something for the podcast, sorry.

1940
02:31:04,932 --> 02:31:05,232
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

1941
02:31:05,672 --> 02:31:07,794
[SPEAKER_17]: Um... I just had a tiny little fanboy orgasm, though.

1942
02:31:08,374 --> 02:31:08,614
[SPEAKER_08]: F.U.

1943
02:31:08,674 --> 02:31:11,877
[SPEAKER_08]: goes to Loki for showing Rob Crabtor my F.U.

1944
02:31:12,517 --> 02:31:15,359
[SPEAKER_08]: Excuse me, it's my moment, okay.

1945
02:31:16,460 --> 02:31:16,540
[SPEAKER_08]: Um...

1946
02:31:19,033 --> 02:31:21,214
[SPEAKER_08]: Animal Crossing DS needs to be out like now.

1947
02:31:21,354 --> 02:31:22,535
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, when's that supposed to be out?

1948
02:31:22,875 --> 02:31:23,455
Eventually.

1949
02:31:23,915 --> 02:31:24,496
[SPEAKER_17]: November.

1950
02:31:25,476 --> 02:31:26,236
[SPEAKER_17]: Aw, fuck them.

1951
02:31:26,737 --> 02:31:33,580
[SPEAKER_08]: F you to not being able to register for my wedding.

1952
02:31:34,280 --> 02:31:41,364
[SPEAKER_08]: Because, you know, I want to register and all this because, you know, I don't care what people say about, you know, don't send me gifts.

1953
02:31:41,484 --> 02:31:44,225
[SPEAKER_08]: When you get married, people feel obligated to give you a present.

1954
02:31:45,071 --> 02:31:46,231
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it's just how things are.

1955
02:31:46,892 --> 02:31:49,452
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I want Amazon gift certificates.

1956
02:31:50,252 --> 02:31:50,813
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's it.

1957
02:31:50,913 --> 02:31:52,453
[SPEAKER_17]: How many toasters do you want, seriously?

1958
02:31:53,033 --> 02:31:53,833
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't eat bread.

1959
02:31:54,114 --> 02:31:54,914
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

1960
02:31:54,974 --> 02:31:56,514
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't fucking need a toaster.

1961
02:31:57,515 --> 02:31:58,815
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah.

1962
02:31:58,935 --> 02:32:05,637
[SPEAKER_08]: As you to the traditional ideas of having to give people, like, household goods for their wedding, just give me Amazon gift certificates.

1963
02:32:05,917 --> 02:32:06,357
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll be happy.

1964
02:32:07,877 --> 02:32:08,218
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it.

1965
02:32:10,178 --> 02:32:13,139
[SPEAKER_17]: Let DarkSakura save up so she can buy many copies of the Kama Sutra.

1966
02:32:14,838 --> 02:32:15,539
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't need that.

1967
02:32:16,339 --> 02:32:18,480
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, why would you need many copies of it?

1968
02:32:18,861 --> 02:32:20,702
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, just to have in various rooms of the house.

1969
02:32:21,282 --> 02:32:21,923
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki's turn.

1970
02:32:23,804 --> 02:32:32,089
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, you know, the only thing I have to say fuck you to is the people that stole my fiancé's car because that sucks.

1971
02:32:32,650 --> 02:32:34,371
[SPEAKER_17]: I wouldn't want that happening to my car.

1972
02:32:34,691 --> 02:32:36,432
[SPEAKER_08]: But I was right, wasn't I?

1973
02:32:36,852 --> 02:32:40,975
[SPEAKER_17]: Luckily, my car has a security system, so, you know.

1974
02:32:42,352 --> 02:32:42,672
[SPEAKER_17]: Gamey.

1975
02:32:43,452 --> 02:32:45,553
[SPEAKER_17]: And then, um, fuck you too.

1976
02:32:46,373 --> 02:32:48,534
[SPEAKER_17]: A lot of the games out there are just sucking ass.

1977
02:32:48,714 --> 02:32:53,596
[SPEAKER_17]: Especially, like, for example, Petite Copter 2, which was a waste of my time.

1978
02:32:53,656 --> 02:32:54,796
[SPEAKER_17]: Don't import that game ever.

1979
02:32:55,337 --> 02:32:57,217
[SPEAKER_17]: It looks strange, but not strange enough.

1980
02:32:58,318 --> 02:33:04,760
[SPEAKER_17]: And, um, yeah, and also fuck you too, that stupid, um, Jack whatever his name is.

1981
02:33:04,800 --> 02:33:06,241
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't even want to, you know.

1982
02:33:06,561 --> 02:33:07,281
[SPEAKER_08]: Jack Thompson?

1983
02:33:07,421 --> 02:33:08,081
[SPEAKER_17]: Jack Thompson!

1984
02:33:08,221 --> 02:33:08,821
[SPEAKER_17]: The idiot?

1985
02:33:08,861 --> 02:33:09,962
[SPEAKER_17]: Freaking idiot.

1986
02:33:11,201 --> 02:33:13,542
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, no, no, no, I'm gonna bring up later on about VG Cats.

1987
02:33:13,923 --> 02:33:23,748
[SPEAKER_17]: But he, you know, he just has to go out there and just, you know, perpetuate the let's not blame the parents for our kids' problems, let's blame someone else stereotype.

1988
02:33:23,968 --> 02:33:26,369
[SPEAKER_17]: So anyways, to hell with him, I hope he dies.

1989
02:33:27,389 --> 02:33:29,731
[SPEAKER_17]: In some ironic way that has to do with video games.

1990
02:33:31,512 --> 02:33:31,812
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm done.

1991
02:33:39,867 --> 02:33:42,848
[SPEAKER_15]: An F you to Nintendo for not having Animal Crossing DS out like now.

1992
02:33:43,109 --> 02:33:50,512
[SPEAKER_17]: An F you to the fact that they're not putting the classic Nintendo games in there because they found out they can make money from it the other way, so you can suck it.

1993
02:33:52,113 --> 02:33:55,815
[SPEAKER_17]: An F you to the fact that I was gone for so long, although I did kind of enjoy the East Coast.

1994
02:33:55,855 --> 02:33:59,477
[SPEAKER_17]: I really missed home, and I missed people, and yeah, all that.

1995
02:33:59,577 --> 02:34:00,737
[SPEAKER_17]: I miss you guys!

1996
02:34:02,698 --> 02:34:03,499
[SPEAKER_17]: But my aim's improving.

1997
02:34:03,519 --> 02:34:07,621
[SPEAKER_08]: You owe me rent on that, you know.

1998
02:34:10,006 --> 02:34:13,429
[SPEAKER_17]: I used to have that bumper sticker on my car like years ago when I really hated my ex.

1999
02:34:13,669 --> 02:34:14,210
[SPEAKER_17]: We're friends now.

2000
02:34:14,730 --> 02:34:16,051
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway, none of that matters.

2001
02:34:18,493 --> 02:34:28,682
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know, just an F you to the fact that I'm... An F you to the fact that I've got a lot of drama going on in other places that don't have to do with the show or anything.

2002
02:34:29,463 --> 02:34:32,966
[SPEAKER_17]: But I can't really say it on air either, so just an F you to all that drama going on there.

2003
02:34:33,987 --> 02:34:36,289
[SPEAKER_17]: And an F you to... An F you to...

2004
02:34:40,106 --> 02:34:41,527
[SPEAKER_17]: Me, because I have nothing else to say.

2005
02:34:41,687 --> 02:34:42,747
[SPEAKER_17]: Stuff, angst in general.

2006
02:34:42,927 --> 02:34:46,028
[SPEAKER_17]: You'd think I'd have a lot of more FUs for my travel, but I really don't.

2007
02:34:47,249 --> 02:34:49,650
[SPEAKER_17]: Just an FU to Southwest for being a crappy airline.

2008
02:34:51,070 --> 02:34:58,393
[SPEAKER_08]: By the way, I'm going to change my FU theme, because I have to go find it to download, to the Mighty Mosh and Emo Rangers theme.

2009
02:34:59,554 --> 02:35:01,275
[SPEAKER_17]: Whatever, maybe we should all change our themes again.

2010
02:35:01,295 --> 02:35:01,955
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know, we'll see.

2011
02:35:02,655 --> 02:35:05,336
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, let's move on, boys and girls.

2012
02:35:05,736 --> 02:35:08,658
[SPEAKER_17]: I made a funny in the song I picked for chatroom FUs tonight.

2013
02:35:08,678 --> 02:35:09,578
[SPEAKER_17]: See if you can catch the joke.

2014
02:35:14,861 --> 02:35:16,402
[SPEAKER_17]: Misty says, fuck gas prices.

2015
02:35:16,422 --> 02:35:18,963
[SPEAKER_17]: They're currently at around $2.53 a gallon here right now.

2016
02:35:19,203 --> 02:35:21,664
[SPEAKER_17]: Hey, $2.69 in my neighborhood, honey.

2017
02:35:21,864 --> 02:35:23,104
[SPEAKER_17]: You should have picked Tetra Q, though.

2018
02:35:24,445 --> 02:35:27,166
[SPEAKER_17]: And I heard it's going to jump to $3 tomorrow or the next day.

2019
02:35:27,226 --> 02:35:29,667
[SPEAKER_17]: Do I have a justifiable reason for not wanting to drive now?

2020
02:35:30,047 --> 02:35:32,368
[SPEAKER_17]: Fuck cage match, too, and I want a copy of Geek now.

2021
02:35:35,290 --> 02:35:40,852
[SPEAKER_17]: Legend of Zaku says F you to the Iraqi insurgent who capped one of my school's student soldier to death last Sunday.

2022
02:35:41,252 --> 02:35:43,834
[SPEAKER_17]: And F you to President Bush for making that situation possible.

2023
02:35:44,374 --> 02:35:48,255
[SPEAKER_17]: F you to all the thunderstorms we've been having tonight, thus taking out the power in my house for a little bit.

2024
02:35:48,595 --> 02:35:54,658
[SPEAKER_17]: And F you to my cable provider, Cablevision, for providing shitty digital cable that gives me channels with piss-poor lag and pixelation.

2025
02:35:56,598 --> 02:36:02,562
[SPEAKER_17]: Tomokun says, fuck my iTunes library for corrupting itself and all but one song not recovering.

2026
02:36:02,882 --> 02:36:04,583
[SPEAKER_17]: The acapella to Feel Good Inc.

2027
02:36:04,703 --> 02:36:05,804
[SPEAKER_17]: was the song that got saved.

2028
02:36:06,944 --> 02:36:07,445
[SPEAKER_08]: You saved it?

2029
02:36:07,665 --> 02:36:08,425
[SPEAKER_08]: Send it to me, please.

2030
02:36:09,926 --> 02:36:15,629
[SPEAKER_17]: Chimera says, F you to not having enough money to buy cool stuff like ATHF DVDs and Napalm.

2031
02:36:17,651 --> 02:36:22,974
[SPEAKER_17]: Socorina says, F you to Jack Thompson for being the biggest fucktard on Earth and causing havoc worldwide.

2032
02:36:25,765 --> 02:36:28,989
[SPEAKER_17]: Dark Knight says, my FU goes to my job for driving me insane.

2033
02:36:29,029 --> 02:36:31,352
[SPEAKER_17]: Another to being broke, and finally to gas prices.

2034
02:36:31,392 --> 02:36:32,894
[SPEAKER_17]: This has gone too damn far!

2035
02:36:36,089 --> 02:36:40,332
[SPEAKER_17]: Dirty Thief says, F you to my damn boss for giving me six extra hours of work.

2036
02:36:40,813 --> 02:36:46,958
[SPEAKER_17]: F you to traffic, thunderstorms, and other shit that ruins my Sunday night, including these damn electronic shit.

2037
02:36:47,618 --> 02:36:51,221
[SPEAKER_17]: And F you to damn wet streets merely making me hit a poor dog.

2038
02:36:51,301 --> 02:36:51,802
[SPEAKER_17]: Fuck that.

2039
02:36:52,262 --> 02:36:55,204
[SPEAKER_17]: My friend almost hit a cat the other night when we were driving in Pennsylvania.

2040
02:36:55,224 --> 02:36:57,786
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, it was the saddest thing ever, and he almost had a heart attack.

2041
02:36:58,127 --> 02:36:59,288
[SPEAKER_18]: Don't hit animals on the road.

2042
02:37:00,148 --> 02:37:01,069
[SPEAKER_17]: Didn't try hard enough.

2043
02:37:01,840 --> 02:37:03,761
[SPEAKER_17]: DarkTetsuya says, Amen to Loki.

2044
02:37:03,841 --> 02:37:05,482
[SPEAKER_17]: Fuck you to Jack Thompson.

2045
02:37:05,803 --> 02:37:07,283
[SPEAKER_17]: Surely you have something better to do?

2046
02:37:10,525 --> 02:37:13,848
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, and Tomokun says, No, the one that didn't get saved.

2047
02:37:13,988 --> 02:37:14,608
[SPEAKER_17]: I screwed up.

2048
02:37:15,288 --> 02:37:16,169
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, so Feel Good Inc.

2049
02:37:16,249 --> 02:37:17,370
[SPEAKER_17]: Acapella didn't get saved.

2050
02:37:17,490 --> 02:37:19,791
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm being assisted with that, and I will be happy to share.

2051
02:37:20,212 --> 02:37:20,712
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, good.

2052
02:37:22,033 --> 02:37:26,876
[SPEAKER_17]: Misty says, Yes, I know that I'm still getting off easy right now, but I still wanted to bitch about it.

2053
02:37:26,916 --> 02:37:27,916
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, okay, fair enough.

2054
02:37:28,337 --> 02:37:30,318
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what you get to do here on this show, so...

2055
02:37:31,383 --> 02:37:32,384
[SPEAKER_17]: That was the FUs of the week!

2056
02:37:34,324 --> 02:37:34,945
[SPEAKER_14]: Hope you enjoyed.

2057
02:37:35,545 --> 02:37:45,830
[SPEAKER_17]: We... So, DarkSakura, I understand we have some guest listeners tonight, or some folks listening, a pretty large contingent from some sites?

2058
02:37:46,050 --> 02:37:51,493
[SPEAKER_08]: A few of the people from the Gorillas Unofficial chat's listening in, so hi guys, thank you for listening in.

2059
02:37:51,713 --> 02:37:58,016
[SPEAKER_08]: We have Bexar and Roz, and I'm trying to remember who else was listening, but if I don't remember, hi!

2060
02:37:58,709 --> 02:37:59,770
[SPEAKER_08]: You get a big shout out from me.

2061
02:37:59,910 --> 02:38:00,971
[SPEAKER_17]: We like it when new people listen.

2062
02:38:01,511 --> 02:38:07,776
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to tip the Orange Lounge hat by just giving a little nod with a song here.

2063
02:38:10,437 --> 02:38:13,720
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll dance like they do in the iPod commercials here with the shadows and everything.

2064
02:38:13,740 --> 02:38:16,021
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd rather not dance like they do in the iPod commercials.

2065
02:38:17,062 --> 02:38:21,085
[SPEAKER_08]: You can just keep playing this for me.

2066
02:38:21,185 --> 02:38:21,886
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, that's all you get.

2067
02:38:21,926 --> 02:38:22,126
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry.

2068
02:38:26,401 --> 02:38:27,121
[SPEAKER_17]: You know what, though?

2069
02:38:27,161 --> 02:38:28,562
[SPEAKER_17]: That makes me think of this.

2070
02:38:28,682 --> 02:38:32,125
[SPEAKER_17]: I was randomly having lunch in Phoenix yesterday, right?

2071
02:38:32,405 --> 02:38:37,389
[SPEAKER_17]: Jason took me to this Chinese restaurant, and we were watching commercials on TV.

2072
02:38:37,729 --> 02:38:43,353
[SPEAKER_17]: And I saw this one that looked like it was parading that commercial with the feel-good ink and the...

2073
02:38:43,733 --> 02:38:45,135
[SPEAKER_17]: iPod Shadow Dancers, right?

2074
02:38:45,655 --> 02:38:47,897
[SPEAKER_17]: But it was children doing the shadow dancing.

2075
02:38:48,197 --> 02:38:49,499
[SPEAKER_17]: And we were like, what the hell is this?

2076
02:38:50,139 --> 02:38:53,583
[SPEAKER_17]: And it turns out it was actually for like a Kidz Bop CD.

2077
02:38:53,643 --> 02:38:54,423
[SPEAKER_17]: But no, it gets better.

2078
02:38:54,824 --> 02:38:59,748
[SPEAKER_17]: It was actually an all-Christian Kidz Bop version.

2079
02:38:59,949 --> 02:39:01,010
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't remember what it was called.

2080
02:39:01,050 --> 02:39:04,153
[SPEAKER_17]: It was like, wow, that's inspiration or something like that.

2081
02:39:04,173 --> 02:39:05,634
[SPEAKER_17]: Kidz Inspiration or something.

2082
02:39:05,694 --> 02:39:08,737
[SPEAKER_17]: It was Kidz Bop, but

2083
02:39:09,321 --> 02:39:15,683
[SPEAKER_17]: all God music and she was telling you to copy or take to a copyright infringement.

2084
02:39:15,703 --> 02:39:20,884
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, I thought Thou Shalt Not Steal was one of the Thou Shalt Not Steal copyrights.

2085
02:39:21,804 --> 02:39:25,105
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we need to actually check the original translation to see what that says.

2086
02:39:26,005 --> 02:39:33,327
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, point of order, in case you didn't know, the original translation for Thou Shalt Not Kill is actually Thou Shalt Not Commit Murder.

2087
02:39:36,328 --> 02:39:36,748
[SPEAKER_15]: Interesting.

2088
02:39:37,028 --> 02:39:37,248
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

2089
02:39:37,868 --> 02:39:38,048
[SPEAKER_08]: See,

2090
02:39:39,321 --> 02:39:41,242
[SPEAKER_08]: I love how much crap they changed.

2091
02:39:42,462 --> 02:39:45,043
[SPEAKER_17]: You know you're opening a whole can of worms when you bring up religion.

2092
02:39:45,103 --> 02:39:47,243
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not going to open up the religion can of worms.

2093
02:39:47,583 --> 02:39:50,504
[SPEAKER_17]: My God, I mean, we get hate mail when Loki bashes on Max.

2094
02:39:50,904 --> 02:39:52,024
[SPEAKER_17]: We don't want to get religion.

2095
02:39:52,645 --> 02:39:53,125
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know what?

2096
02:39:53,205 --> 02:39:55,005
[SPEAKER_08]: I usually forward all that over to his email.

2097
02:39:55,045 --> 02:39:55,405
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, good.

2098
02:39:56,186 --> 02:39:57,326
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't get any hate mail.

2099
02:39:58,186 --> 02:40:00,367
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly, although I did share the funny Mac one with you.

2100
02:40:01,127 --> 02:40:02,447
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, well, whatever.

2101
02:40:03,508 --> 02:40:04,348
[SPEAKER_17]: That one was stupid.

2102
02:40:04,768 --> 02:40:05,068
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

2103
02:40:05,694 --> 02:40:07,414
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to go to a quick break, boys and girls.

2104
02:40:07,454 --> 02:40:10,715
[SPEAKER_17]: When we come back, we're going to do a little bit of Ask Orange Lounge.

2105
02:40:10,775 --> 02:40:17,196
[SPEAKER_17]: And, you know, I just came back from a trip, and we were kind of off last week, except for, well, you know, there was the music show going on.

2106
02:40:17,256 --> 02:40:20,917
[SPEAKER_17]: But, you know, we haven't had a chance to do some Ask Orange Lounge in a little while.

2107
02:40:21,017 --> 02:40:24,858
[SPEAKER_17]: So here's your chance to ask us something, anything you want.

2108
02:40:25,538 --> 02:40:28,158
[SPEAKER_17]: So we're going to go just to some more music potpourri.

2109
02:40:28,278 --> 02:40:31,659
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll probably do another In the Groove song this break for you folks that are into that.

2110
02:40:33,672 --> 02:40:47,125
[SPEAKER_17]: and I know there's a lot of folks out there that are into this song and we haven't played it in a long time so like it or not, here's some Cartoon Heroes we'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio and Ask Orange Lounge so send your questions in to Sky be a private message

2111
02:42:45,824 --> 02:42:46,466
Thanks for watching!

2112
02:44:01,641 --> 02:44:03,066
Thanks for watching!

2113
02:44:51,734 --> 02:44:52,276
and more.

2114
02:47:05,968 --> 02:47:06,969
[SPEAKER_15]: I just made that connection.

2115
02:47:07,409 --> 02:47:12,633
[SPEAKER_17]: I think the guy wanted to hear the Romeo and Juliet song from In the Groove, and I played that one instead.

2116
02:47:15,315 --> 02:47:15,715
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoops!

2117
02:47:17,056 --> 02:47:18,117
[SPEAKER_17]: Boy, did I fuck that one up.

2118
02:47:20,538 --> 02:47:25,841
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob messed up, Rob messed up, la la, la la, la la, la la

2119
02:47:47,458 --> 02:47:49,279
[SPEAKER_17]: Max Unlimited in that break, too.

2120
02:47:51,240 --> 02:47:52,541
[SPEAKER_17]: Is it Minimalian or Minimalian?

2121
02:47:52,621 --> 02:47:53,601
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's Minimalian.

2122
02:47:53,681 --> 02:47:54,942
[SPEAKER_08]: Minimalian.

2123
02:47:55,202 --> 02:47:56,223
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

2124
02:47:56,323 --> 02:47:56,963
[SPEAKER_08]: Mini-something.

2125
02:47:57,123 --> 02:47:57,643
[SPEAKER_17]: Mini-something.

2126
02:47:57,923 --> 02:47:59,104
[SPEAKER_17]: And then Romeo and Juliet.

2127
02:47:59,124 --> 02:47:59,544
[SPEAKER_08]: By who?

2128
02:47:59,704 --> 02:48:00,425
[SPEAKER_17]: By Lolita.

2129
02:48:01,585 --> 02:48:02,866
[SPEAKER_08]: You never said who Minimalian was.

2130
02:48:03,006 --> 02:48:04,187
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, Detroitian.

2131
02:48:04,547 --> 02:48:05,427
[SPEAKER_08]: No, Detroitian.

2132
02:48:05,547 --> 02:48:06,248
[SPEAKER_17]: Detroitian.

2133
02:48:06,648 --> 02:48:07,248
[SPEAKER_08]: Detroitian.

2134
02:48:07,308 --> 02:48:08,249
[SPEAKER_08]: That's just a cool name.

2135
02:48:09,349 --> 02:48:12,471
[SPEAKER_17]: Here's that little clip of the other Romeo and Juliet song.

2136
02:48:19,773 --> 02:48:22,094
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, I actually do like this Romeo and Juliet better, too.

2137
02:48:22,154 --> 02:48:23,635
[SPEAKER_15]: Why didn't I think of this at first?

2138
02:48:23,735 --> 02:48:24,035
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

2139
02:48:26,076 --> 02:48:28,017
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm just in a para mode tonight or something.

2140
02:48:28,397 --> 02:48:28,857
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know.

2141
02:48:30,098 --> 02:48:31,178
[SPEAKER_17]: I can't believe I did that.

2142
02:48:32,039 --> 02:48:37,401
[SPEAKER_17]: Next time, kids, specify the artist if there's more than one song by the name or I might fuck your request up.

2143
02:48:43,244 --> 02:48:45,765
[SPEAKER_17]: I bet that guy's not happy, though, whose request I fucked up.

2144
02:48:45,805 --> 02:48:47,986
[SPEAKER_17]: But, you know, I'm human.

2145
02:48:48,006 --> 02:48:48,506
[SPEAKER_17]: What can I say?

2146
02:48:49,236 --> 02:48:49,977
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, the other one.

2147
02:48:49,997 --> 02:48:51,998
[SPEAKER_08]: It was Tomokun requested it.

2148
02:48:52,198 --> 02:48:52,638
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.

2149
02:48:52,759 --> 02:48:53,739
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sorry, Tomokun.

2150
02:48:53,819 --> 02:48:56,801
[SPEAKER_08]: And he specifically spelled it a different way.

2151
02:48:57,041 --> 02:48:59,123
[SPEAKER_17]: It didn't click for me at first.

2152
02:48:59,183 --> 02:48:59,463
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sorry.

2153
02:48:59,503 --> 02:49:01,344
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob doesn't care about our listeners.

2154
02:49:01,404 --> 02:49:01,905
[SPEAKER_17]: You know what?

2155
02:49:01,925 --> 02:49:02,625
[SPEAKER_17]: You found me out.

2156
02:49:02,645 --> 02:49:05,507
[SPEAKER_17]: Just because in the groove is forgettable, that's all.

2157
02:49:06,628 --> 02:49:11,011
[SPEAKER_17]: I was waiting for Loki to jump in there with some slamming in the groove comment.

2158
02:49:11,651 --> 02:49:13,012
[SPEAKER_08]: You snubbed my fanboy.

2159
02:49:13,032 --> 02:49:14,173
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

2160
02:49:14,193 --> 02:49:14,673
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sorry.

2161
02:49:15,699 --> 02:49:18,200
[SPEAKER_17]: I may have snubbed your fanboy, but I didn't snub your stalker.

2162
02:49:18,260 --> 02:49:19,740
[SPEAKER_17]: I've been reading DDR Freak lately.

2163
02:49:19,900 --> 02:49:21,681
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, my stalker is scary.

2164
02:49:22,561 --> 02:49:23,441
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, my God.

2165
02:49:23,742 --> 02:49:24,362
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, my God.

2166
02:49:24,482 --> 02:49:25,442
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, no, no, no, no.

2167
02:49:25,842 --> 02:49:27,563
[SPEAKER_08]: This Blair is King guy.

2168
02:49:27,943 --> 02:49:28,263
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

2169
02:49:28,323 --> 02:49:32,604
[SPEAKER_17]: DarkSakura, I watched you leave in your car today.

2170
02:49:33,825 --> 02:49:37,286
[SPEAKER_14]: You going to lock another thread today?

2171
02:49:37,306 --> 02:49:43,167
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I really do want to thank... Iguana Girl is my best friend.

2172
02:49:44,048 --> 02:49:44,968
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, she will...

2173
02:49:45,885 --> 02:49:46,445
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2174
02:50:16,344 --> 02:50:17,065
[SPEAKER_08]: Fanboy is cool.

2175
02:50:17,645 --> 02:50:18,847
[SPEAKER_14]: Creepy Stalker is not cool.

2176
02:50:18,887 --> 02:50:23,511
[SPEAKER_08]: He sends me private messages saying, you should probably warn this person.

2177
02:50:23,551 --> 02:50:24,832
[SPEAKER_08]: You should probably warn this person.

2178
02:50:24,852 --> 02:50:25,733
[SPEAKER_08]: You should watch this thread.

2179
02:50:26,013 --> 02:50:29,456
[SPEAKER_17]: I send those to Iguana Girl and sometimes you, and I'm not stalking you guys.

2180
02:50:29,717 --> 02:50:34,721
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, but he's like all the time doing it, and I'm like, oh my god, you're a freak.

2181
02:50:35,982 --> 02:50:37,043
[SPEAKER_17]: He might be listening.

2182
02:50:37,103 --> 02:50:39,726
[SPEAKER_17]: This poor guy's probably listening, and you're breaking his heart.

2183
02:50:39,746 --> 02:50:40,226
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope so.

2184
02:50:40,246 --> 02:50:41,067
[SPEAKER_08]: You're breaking his heart.

2185
02:50:41,545 --> 02:50:43,927
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm giving him a solid dose of reality.

2186
02:50:44,067 --> 02:50:44,548
[SPEAKER_08]: It's good.

2187
02:50:44,568 --> 02:50:45,389
[SPEAKER_17]: Good for the soul.

2188
02:50:45,589 --> 02:50:49,372
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it actually does sound kind of like he's trying to kiss my ass.

2189
02:50:49,392 --> 02:50:50,873
[SPEAKER_17]: He just wants to be a mod.

2190
02:50:50,913 --> 02:50:51,854
[SPEAKER_17]: Is that so wrong?

2191
02:50:51,914 --> 02:50:53,796
[SPEAKER_17]: Isn't that what all the kids want?

2192
02:50:53,836 --> 02:50:54,857
[SPEAKER_08]: He wants to be a mod.

2193
02:50:56,395 --> 02:50:59,797
[SPEAKER_08]: Being a moderator on DDR Freak is not all roses and sunshine.

2194
02:50:59,817 --> 02:51:00,917
[SPEAKER_17]: So he can get closer to you.

2195
02:51:02,217 --> 02:51:04,398
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't say stuff like that!

2196
02:51:04,418 --> 02:51:05,479
[SPEAKER_08]: You're freaking me out!

2197
02:51:05,739 --> 02:51:13,862
[SPEAKER_17]: Doesn't he know that the mods on DDR Freak are appointed by God and you can't obviously become one unless you have a miracle?

2198
02:51:14,162 --> 02:51:16,463
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, if you want to know, we sort of vote on you, moderators.

2199
02:51:16,843 --> 02:51:18,544
[SPEAKER_17]: You have to have three miracles.

2200
02:51:20,885 --> 02:51:23,366
[SPEAKER_08]: And then after that we part the Dead Sea and...

2201
02:51:25,788 --> 02:51:29,851
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, spitnails, shit ice cream, that type of thing.

2202
02:51:29,871 --> 02:51:30,271
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck no!

2203
02:51:57,628 --> 02:51:58,849
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm proud of myself for that one.

2204
02:51:59,709 --> 02:52:00,350
[SPEAKER_17]: I made that up.

2205
02:52:02,411 --> 02:52:03,691
[SPEAKER_17]: I should be on Whose Line Is It Anyway?

2206
02:52:03,751 --> 02:52:06,313
[SPEAKER_17]: Rene has two queries, one for Loki.

2207
02:52:06,493 --> 02:52:07,353
[SPEAKER_17]: He said queries.

2208
02:52:07,894 --> 02:52:08,614
[SPEAKER_17]: One for Loki.

2209
02:52:09,034 --> 02:52:14,778
[SPEAKER_17]: Since he's playing Star Soldier, does that freaky face that becomes whole mid-level boss still appear in the game?

2210
02:52:15,598 --> 02:52:18,159
[SPEAKER_17]: Yep, every single level almost.

2211
02:52:20,501 --> 02:52:20,961
[SPEAKER_17]: That's that.

2212
02:52:22,272 --> 02:52:33,760
[SPEAKER_17]: Rene says, and one for anybody who has played at E3, I heard that the E3 demo for We Heart Katamari was exclusive for E3.

2213
02:52:34,120 --> 02:52:35,721
[SPEAKER_08]: It was, he even talks to you.

2214
02:52:35,941 --> 02:52:37,182
[SPEAKER_17]: What was so exclusive about it?

2215
02:52:37,402 --> 02:52:44,086
[SPEAKER_08]: He actually said that, yeah, there's this convention with all these people playing this to see my beautiful presence or something.

2216
02:52:44,687 --> 02:52:47,489
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's actually talking about people being at E3.

2217
02:52:48,109 --> 02:53:10,076
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, it actually, in the text, it actually talks about, like, oh, we hope you enjoy this E3 demo, you know, and, like, I just remember the E3 was referenced in the King of Cosmos dialogue, and it's kind of too bad that that dialogue will probably never see the light of day in the real world, because it was that same, like, funny writing, quirky writing, that makes Katamari Damacy so special.

2218
02:53:10,437 --> 02:53:11,717
[SPEAKER_17]: So that was pretty much what it was.

2219
02:53:15,578 --> 02:53:17,659
[SPEAKER_17]: That game got delayed till September as well.

2220
02:53:18,462 --> 02:53:18,822
[SPEAKER_17]: Don't!

2221
02:53:20,763 --> 02:53:27,546
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll just say, hey Bradley, you live like, what, five minutes from my house, why don't you come over and, oh yeah, bring Katamari too, you can bring it.

2222
02:53:27,686 --> 02:53:30,167
[SPEAKER_17]: I have an HD loader and HDL dump, you know.

2223
02:53:31,027 --> 02:53:34,849
[SPEAKER_17]: You'll have to come over and show me how to get that set up, by the way.

2224
02:53:35,169 --> 02:53:38,570
[SPEAKER_17]: I have We Love Katamari on an unmodded US PlayStation 2.

2225
02:53:38,970 --> 02:53:45,073
[SPEAKER_17]: If I get a US, if I get the old style PlayStation on a hard drive, can I still get HD loader somehow?

2226
02:53:45,553 --> 02:53:47,654
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, there are free versions that are available still.

2227
02:53:47,898 --> 02:53:49,100
[SPEAKER_17]: for your memory card.

2228
02:53:49,140 --> 02:53:53,067
[SPEAKER_17]: And you can even run homebrew stuff and all that wonderful stuff without a mod chip.

2229
02:53:53,347 --> 02:53:53,688
[SPEAKER_17]: Good to hear.

2230
02:53:54,329 --> 02:53:57,595
[SPEAKER_17]: Socorino wants to know, what does Loki think about stuffed penises?

2231
02:53:58,536 --> 02:53:59,378
[SPEAKER_17]: That's the question.

2232
02:54:01,941 --> 02:54:03,021
[SPEAKER_17]: Look at the monitor yourself.

2233
02:54:03,061 --> 02:54:03,442
[SPEAKER_17]: There it is.

2234
02:54:03,702 --> 02:54:07,605
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, honestly, we were going to get Rob an inflatable penis.

2235
02:54:08,025 --> 02:54:10,908
[SPEAKER_17]: And to surprise him, we found it at the adult store.

2236
02:54:10,928 --> 02:54:11,829
[SPEAKER_14]: Detachable penis.

2237
02:54:12,189 --> 02:54:18,714
[SPEAKER_17]: That was at... We went to... We actually went to Gold Club Centerfolds with Rob's roommate and my fiance.

2238
02:54:18,754 --> 02:54:22,277
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, speaking of Rob's roommate, here comes Extifer right now.

2239
02:54:22,917 --> 02:54:25,520
[SPEAKER_17]: And so my fiance, she got a lap dance.

2240
02:54:26,080 --> 02:54:28,362
[SPEAKER_17]: And the stripper licked her boob.

2241
02:54:28,822 --> 02:54:31,084
[SPEAKER_17]: And then... Well, she was...

2242
02:54:32,565 --> 02:54:45,230
[SPEAKER_17]: I personally had to pay for all three of us, so that was a $150 adventure, in which I got no lap dance and no boobs rubbed in my face, and the cheesesteaks were fucking awful!

2243
02:54:45,550 --> 02:54:46,711
[SPEAKER_17]: What the hell happened?

2244
02:54:46,931 --> 02:54:51,333
[SPEAKER_15]: Lap dance is always better when the stripper is crying.

2245
02:54:52,053 --> 02:54:52,373
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

2246
02:54:52,693 --> 02:54:53,174
[SPEAKER_15]: Gay man.

2247
02:54:53,894 --> 02:54:54,154
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh-huh.

2248
02:54:54,214 --> 02:54:55,015
[SPEAKER_15]: Stripper club.

2249
02:54:56,355 --> 02:54:56,855
[SPEAKER_15]: What the hell?

2250
02:54:57,456 --> 02:55:00,177
[SPEAKER_15]: Actually, I used to go all the time, too, so I put...

2251
02:55:01,335 --> 02:55:02,776
[SPEAKER_15]: Your first experience, how was it?

2252
02:55:03,096 --> 02:55:03,937
[SPEAKER_15]: It was great.

2253
02:55:04,917 --> 02:55:05,898
[SPEAKER_00]: There were strippers.

2254
02:55:06,638 --> 02:55:10,280
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I say... You can say whatever you want on the internet.

2255
02:55:10,600 --> 02:55:11,041
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I can?

2256
02:55:11,121 --> 02:55:11,401
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

2257
02:55:11,841 --> 02:55:13,162
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw a lot of pussy.

2258
02:55:14,442 --> 02:55:16,664
[SPEAKER_00]: And I saw a lot of ass.

2259
02:55:17,784 --> 02:55:22,447
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, Loki's girlfriend pointed out to me that they bleach their assholes.

2260
02:55:23,428 --> 02:55:25,088
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, they really do.

2261
02:55:26,789 --> 02:55:28,430
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, they seriously do.

2262
02:55:29,011 --> 02:55:29,211
[SPEAKER_00]: Like...

2263
02:55:30,225 --> 02:55:31,386
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like regular skin.

2264
02:55:31,406 --> 02:55:33,488
[SPEAKER_03]: The bigger life of strippers.

2265
02:55:33,728 --> 02:55:34,049
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

2266
02:55:35,890 --> 02:55:39,714
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, so yeah, a lot of pussy, a lot of ass, a lot of boobs.

2267
02:55:40,434 --> 02:55:42,416
[SPEAKER_00]: But I didn't get boobs rubbed in my face either.

2268
02:55:42,436 --> 02:55:43,137
[SPEAKER_00]: Me neither.

2269
02:55:43,697 --> 02:55:46,760
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm telling you, okay, all three of us were sitting at the goddamn rail.

2270
02:55:46,940 --> 02:55:49,402
[SPEAKER_17]: I was tipping for all three of us because I had to.

2271
02:55:49,983 --> 02:55:54,087
[SPEAKER_17]: And, um, who gets the boobs rubbed in their face but my goddamn fiancé?

2272
02:55:54,667 --> 02:55:56,689
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, as it should be.

2273
02:55:57,722 --> 02:56:05,449
[SPEAKER_17]: I think what we need to do is we need to crop just that little portion of the show right there and have that be the four-year consideration clip for next year's Life 365 Awards.

2274
02:56:05,809 --> 02:56:09,653
[SPEAKER_17]: Just expert going, and some strippers bleach their assholes!

2275
02:56:11,955 --> 02:56:13,536
[SPEAKER_15]: Orange Lounge Radio, Video Game Radio.

2276
02:56:15,058 --> 02:56:19,522
[SPEAKER_03]: We like video games and stripper chat.

2277
02:56:22,845 --> 02:56:23,225
[SPEAKER_03]: You know...

2278
02:56:25,512 --> 02:56:30,420
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, we're degenerating into bleached asshole chat.

2279
02:56:30,480 --> 02:56:32,824
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, I am almost getting... Which is better than...

2280
02:56:34,930 --> 02:56:43,453
[SPEAKER_17]: I think you just made some of your fans... I think we should honestly use that as a segue to DarkSakura's tip of the week, you know, thing.

2281
02:56:43,733 --> 02:56:51,016
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, if we talked about video games all the time, we wouldn't have time to talk about strippers bleaching their assholes.

2282
02:56:51,036 --> 02:56:58,138
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god, it's actually funny, one of our listeners in the girl's chat says she's heard about it.

2283
02:56:58,158 --> 02:56:59,799
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh my god.

2284
02:57:00,731 --> 02:57:03,033
[SPEAKER_17]: Bleached Asshole Chat That's it, that's it.

2285
02:57:03,153 --> 02:57:07,736
[SPEAKER_17]: From now on we no longer have Paris Hilton Chat, we have Bleached Asshole Chat.

2286
02:57:07,797 --> 02:57:08,477
[SPEAKER_17]: Same difference.

2287
02:57:08,517 --> 02:57:09,478
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to go next time too.

2288
02:57:09,498 --> 02:57:10,379
[SPEAKER_08]: I got boobs in my face.

2289
02:57:10,519 --> 02:57:12,000
[SPEAKER_08]: I got boobs in my face last time.

2290
02:57:12,020 --> 02:57:12,660
[SPEAKER_08]: Strippers love gay men.

2291
02:57:26,567 --> 02:57:30,410
[SPEAKER_17]: Now that my ass has broadband, I need some cool things to do besides look at Prawn and the like.

2292
02:57:54,031 --> 02:57:57,055
[SPEAKER_17]: Some suggestions for Zaku now that he's upgraded to broadband.

2293
02:57:58,697 --> 02:58:00,179
[SPEAKER_17]: Downloading our podcast.

2294
02:58:03,223 --> 02:58:04,144
[SPEAKER_03]: Subscribe!

2295
02:58:04,685 --> 02:58:06,567
[SPEAKER_17]: Go into iTunes and search for OrangeLight.

2296
02:58:07,448 --> 02:58:09,271
[SPEAKER_17]: Did you know we're featured on iTunes this week?

2297
02:58:09,311 --> 02:58:09,611
[SPEAKER_17]: Did you?

2298
02:58:10,092 --> 02:58:10,833
[SPEAKER_17]: Did I mention that?

2299
02:58:13,451 --> 02:58:16,712
[SPEAKER_08]: And then get BitTorrent and download a bunch of Sentai TV.

2300
02:58:17,832 --> 02:58:23,654
[SPEAKER_17]: I was going to suggest online gaming, now that you don't have to develop.

2301
02:58:23,994 --> 02:58:24,914
[SPEAKER_17]: Get into some online games.

2302
02:58:25,074 --> 02:58:28,555
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god, you can play Free Ragnarok with me if I can ever get KRO to work.

2303
02:58:29,896 --> 02:58:31,476
[SPEAKER_18]: Try some online games.

2304
02:58:32,236 --> 02:58:33,036
[SPEAKER_08]: Play PSO with me.

2305
02:58:33,056 --> 02:58:37,458
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm wondering when I'm going to actually get back to playing Final Fantasy XI.

2306
02:58:37,518 --> 02:58:39,178
[SPEAKER_17]: All these console games distract me.

2307
02:58:40,594 --> 02:58:47,596
[SPEAKER_17]: Tomo-kun wants to know, why did my brother get a text message at 5am from his job's assistant manager about his penis size?

2308
02:58:48,396 --> 02:58:48,676
[SPEAKER_08]: Drunk.

2309
02:58:51,716 --> 02:58:52,017
[SPEAKER_17]: Gay?

2310
02:58:52,337 --> 02:58:52,717
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know.

2311
02:58:53,717 --> 02:58:54,397
[SPEAKER_17]: Probably not gay.

2312
02:58:56,137 --> 02:58:58,618
[SPEAKER_03]: American penis so big!

2313
02:59:00,018 --> 02:59:06,640
[SPEAKER_17]: Perhaps he had inquired about his penis size earlier today, and his boss just finally got him around to getting that.

2314
02:59:06,680 --> 02:59:08,600
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe you didn't hear the whole story.

2315
02:59:09,366 --> 02:59:10,235
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe that's what's going on.

2316
02:59:14,816 --> 02:59:21,481
[SPEAKER_17]: MJSI24 wants to know, I listen to the podcast mostly, as I can't listen to the live show usually.

2317
02:59:21,541 --> 02:59:27,245
[SPEAKER_17]: Hey, you and about a thousand other people, by the way, in comparing the ratings from a podcast to the live show.

2318
02:59:27,926 --> 02:59:30,067
[SPEAKER_17]: But I'm wondering when you record the podcast.

2319
02:59:30,087 --> 02:59:35,031
[SPEAKER_17]: What are you planning on talking about this week, and what day will it officially be posted to iTunes for download?

2320
02:59:35,711 --> 02:59:41,936
[SPEAKER_17]: We record our podcast, believe it or not, immediately after we do this show, which is why if we ever sound a little worn out or

2321
02:59:42,301 --> 02:59:43,502
[SPEAKER_17]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2322
03:00:08,716 --> 03:00:11,217
[SPEAKER_17]: So another fun parents are ignorant discussion.

2323
03:00:11,257 --> 03:00:12,057
[SPEAKER_17]: Should be a good time.

2324
03:00:12,837 --> 03:00:15,498
[SPEAKER_17]: What day will it officially be posted to iTunes to download?

2325
03:00:16,178 --> 03:00:16,858
[SPEAKER_17]: It should show up.

2326
03:00:17,078 --> 03:00:20,919
[SPEAKER_17]: It usually gets posted right after midnight Pacific time.

2327
03:00:21,780 --> 03:00:23,180
[SPEAKER_17]: So early, early Monday morning.

2328
03:00:23,240 --> 03:00:24,380
[SPEAKER_17]: They're supposed to roll out on Mondays.

2329
03:00:24,660 --> 03:00:26,721
[SPEAKER_17]: So when you wake up Monday morning, it should be there.

2330
03:00:27,141 --> 03:00:30,362
[SPEAKER_17]: If not, we had some type of internal problem and we'll get it up as soon as we can.

2331
03:00:30,582 --> 03:00:33,623
[SPEAKER_17]: So that should answer that.

2332
03:00:36,277 --> 03:00:40,019
[SPEAKER_17]: Tomokun wants to clarify he was talking about his own cock, as he put it.

2333
03:00:41,560 --> 03:00:43,762
[SPEAKER_17]: Not Tomokun, but anyway, forget it.

2334
03:00:46,704 --> 03:00:47,084
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know.

2335
03:00:49,165 --> 03:00:49,385
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

2336
03:00:50,266 --> 03:00:50,846
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that was it.

2337
03:00:50,886 --> 03:00:51,927
[SPEAKER_17]: That was pretty much all the questions we had.

2338
03:00:51,947 --> 03:00:52,207
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, okay.

2339
03:00:52,427 --> 03:00:53,648
[SPEAKER_17]: I thought we might have had one more.

2340
03:00:55,930 --> 03:00:56,590
[SPEAKER_17]: Did I lose it?

2341
03:00:56,650 --> 03:00:57,110
[SPEAKER_17]: What did I do?

2342
03:00:57,190 --> 03:00:58,291
[SPEAKER_17]: Did I accidentally close the window?

2343
03:00:58,892 --> 03:01:00,433
[SPEAKER_17]: Do we have any emails?

2344
03:01:02,374 --> 03:01:05,636
[SPEAKER_17]: Our emails were all for... Yeah, all the emails we get are the podcast.

2345
03:01:07,500 --> 03:01:08,221
[SPEAKER_17]: No one loves us.

2346
03:01:08,521 --> 03:01:12,284
[SPEAKER_17]: Remember, a thousand more people listen to the podcast than listen to this show.

2347
03:01:13,985 --> 03:01:14,585
[SPEAKER_17]: But that's okay.

2348
03:01:15,546 --> 03:01:17,087
[SPEAKER_17]: So we do this show because we love you guys.

2349
03:01:17,367 --> 03:01:17,607
[SPEAKER_17]: Really.

2350
03:01:17,747 --> 03:01:20,609
[SPEAKER_17]: This is just a labor of love now because we're certainly not getting the ratings.

2351
03:01:21,910 --> 03:01:23,732
[SPEAKER_08]: It smells like fresh podcast in here.

2352
03:01:25,173 --> 03:01:26,494
[SPEAKER_17]: Are you talking about my podcast?

2353
03:01:27,014 --> 03:01:27,554
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe.

2354
03:01:30,116 --> 03:01:31,257
[SPEAKER_08]: That will never get old.

2355
03:01:33,779 --> 03:01:34,359
[SPEAKER_17]: Never, never, never.

2356
03:01:34,819 --> 03:01:35,500
[SPEAKER_08]: Ever, ever, ever.

2357
03:01:36,872 --> 03:01:37,152
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

2358
03:01:38,512 --> 03:01:41,433
[SPEAKER_17]: I guess what we'll do now is end the show.

2359
03:01:45,394 --> 03:01:46,754
[SPEAKER_17]: What's so funny, Extifer?

2360
03:01:48,234 --> 03:01:50,014
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, because we're done.

2361
03:01:50,054 --> 03:01:54,435
[SPEAKER_17]: It's 9.29, and by the time we get our final thoughts out and everything, it'll be 9.30, and that's a done show.

2362
03:01:54,495 --> 03:01:57,456
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm sure the fortune cookie is probably another five minutes, so we're running over anyway.

2363
03:01:58,336 --> 03:01:58,736
[SPEAKER_17]: So whatever.

2364
03:01:58,796 --> 03:01:59,176
[SPEAKER_17]: Who cares?

2365
03:01:59,216 --> 03:01:59,516
[SPEAKER_17]: We're done.

2366
03:02:01,296 --> 03:02:01,797
[SPEAKER_17]: You want more?

2367
03:02:01,877 --> 03:02:02,657
[SPEAKER_17]: Tune in next week.

2368
03:02:02,697 --> 03:02:03,177
[SPEAKER_17]: You want more?

2369
03:02:03,237 --> 03:02:03,417
[SPEAKER_17]: More?

2370
03:02:03,477 --> 03:02:04,377
[SPEAKER_17]: Tune in to the podcast.

2371
03:02:06,141 --> 03:02:07,081
[SPEAKER_17]: Final thoughts, boys and girls.

2372
03:02:07,162 --> 03:02:08,682
[SPEAKER_17]: Loki, or Extifer, you're in the room.

2373
03:02:08,742 --> 03:02:09,503
[SPEAKER_17]: Why don't you start us off?

2374
03:02:10,843 --> 03:02:11,504
[SPEAKER_17]: Loke Extifer.

2375
03:02:11,644 --> 03:02:13,605
[SPEAKER_17]: Extifer, what is your final thought?

2376
03:02:13,885 --> 03:02:16,006
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in the groove.

2377
03:02:17,867 --> 03:02:19,147
[SPEAKER_17]: Wait a minute, I said Extifer.

2378
03:02:20,468 --> 03:02:22,129
[SPEAKER_17]: Loki, what's your final thought?

2379
03:02:23,229 --> 03:02:31,654
[SPEAKER_17]: My final thought is I have to play a lot more console games this week, and strippers really do bleach their assholes.

2380
03:02:32,054 --> 03:02:32,434
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

2381
03:02:33,330 --> 03:02:34,111
[SPEAKER_17]: DarkSakura.

2382
03:02:34,131 --> 03:02:35,472
[SPEAKER_17]: Actually, I'll give you my final thought.

2383
03:02:35,492 --> 03:02:38,574
[SPEAKER_17]: My final thought is I'm sweating.

2384
03:02:38,614 --> 03:02:40,095
[SPEAKER_17]: It's hot in here and not in the good way.

2385
03:02:40,736 --> 03:02:41,196
[SPEAKER_17]: DarkSakura.

2386
03:02:42,717 --> 03:02:43,818
[SPEAKER_08]: What do I say every show?

2387
03:02:45,659 --> 03:02:46,820
[SPEAKER_17]: Reject false bleach.

2388
03:02:47,340 --> 03:02:48,781
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, reject false assholes.

2389
03:02:49,121 --> 03:02:50,563
[SPEAKER_08]: Bleach next time.

2390
03:02:57,236 --> 03:02:58,237
[SPEAKER_03]: You heard it here first.

2391
03:02:58,317 --> 03:02:59,558
[SPEAKER_03]: Reject false assholes.

2392
03:03:00,338 --> 03:03:01,559
[SPEAKER_03]: Only good for real.

2393
03:03:01,579 --> 03:03:02,780
[SPEAKER_03]: 100% organic asshole.

2394
03:03:03,221 --> 03:03:07,624
[SPEAKER_03]: Organically colored assholes.

2395
03:03:08,685 --> 03:03:13,228
[SPEAKER_17]: We are ending this show now before this joke goes on a little too far.

2396
03:03:13,368 --> 03:03:13,789
[SPEAKER_17]: Too late.

[SPEAKER_17]: I'll give it to Eksta for one word to sum the whole thing up.

2403
03:03:25,718 --> 03:03:25,838
[SPEAKER_13]: Ass.

2404
03:03:27,133 --> 03:03:30,155

[SPEAKER_15]: Fade to black.

[SPEAKER_03]: Piss off!
