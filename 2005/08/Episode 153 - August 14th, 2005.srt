After taking last week kind of a mini vacation

7
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:45,220
I mean there was still a show, but it wasn't the show show right there you were there, but it wasn't the OLR experience

8
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,220
So to say it was the

9
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,060
So it was the let's multitask show no

10
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,040
Anyway tonight though I'm back after being gone for two weeks because I know there was a show a couple weeks ago

11
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:04,260
Oh, but enjoy your box. I enjoyed the FedEx box immensely. I was popping on the bubble wrap

12
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:08,320
So on tonight's show, we're gonna talk about my East Coast tournament

13
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,640
I went to I went to an East Coast tournament and I saw in the group, too

14
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:17,360
So I can't wait to talk about that. And also we're going to talk about the the DDR with fire

15
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:24,040
Dark soccer's favorite thing DDR with fire. It's actually called dance simulation

16
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,720
But it's I call it DR with fire

I'm giving you my heart I love, my love

85
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,980

00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:39,280

I'm giving you my heart I love, my love

89
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:49,080

I don't wanna play

91
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:23,080
I don't wanna play

92
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:30,080
Like those on the way back to back to back to back to back to back

93
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:35,080
I know, but I'm afraid, where are we going?

94
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:39,080
into the dark black forest.

95
00:15:35,080 --> 00:16:04,080
into the dark black forest.

96
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:08,080
Orange Lounge Radio. We put your thing down, flip it, and reverse it.

97
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:13,080
This server made a bit of my head numb. This server made a bit of my head numb.

98
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:16,980
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio,

99
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:20,380
episode number 153 in progress.

100
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:23,440
How are you guys doing tonight? I'm back.

101
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,180
I'm back for my trip that I went to the East Coast. I was sent in FedEx packaging

102
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:30,980
courtesy of Loki and Dark Sakura. I'm glad that they treated you well.

103
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:39,980
You know, they actually lost some of our shipments the other week so I was like, hey, he might be gone. We might never get him back.

104
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:46,980
Actually, FedEx was full so I had to suffer a fate worse than FedEx. I had to fly southwest.

105
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:55,980
That makes no sense. Southwest does not fly east. I mean, that's northeast. That's the complete opposite of southwest.

106
00:16:55,980 --> 00:17:01,060
ironic Southwest actually flies to the northeast now and that's how I got to

107
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:06,820
where I was going so but oh lord try spending five hours on a plane with

108
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:11,340
grandpa who's really really obese I mean you know not that there's anything wrong

109
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:14,580
with being really obese but when you're trying to sit next to me on a plane it's

110
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:19,660
like you know I've got no wiggle room whatsoever in flight movies it's

111
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:24,660
Southwest there is no in-flight movies there's when you bring a laptop yeah I

112
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:25,780
I brought my PSP.

113
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:29,060
I'm going to talk about that on the podcast, because I did bring my PSP.

114
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:32,220
And Sharks Girl, if you're out there, I love you,

115
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,900
because she loaned me movies I could watch on my PSP.

116
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:39,180
And I've always knocked the idea of movies on a PSP,

117
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:41,100
but I take it all back after this trip.

118
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,100
I take it all back.

119
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,140
I'm so sorry.

120
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:46,620
I'm so, so sorry for those comments, because seriously, it

121
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:47,940
saved my ass this week.

122
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:50,540
So I'm very happy.

123
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:54,100
So my in-flight movies were Tron on the way over, which, believe it or not,

124
00:17:54,100 --> 00:18:01,080
never seen before and I robot on the way back on piss the PSP so but it didn't

125
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,940
stop this grandpa guy from trying to talk to me in his little not just

126
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:07,600
grandpa but the daughter or the grand and the daughter the granddaughter it

127
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:12,820
was in sixth grade that was kind of one of those like scary-looking children

128
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:17,280
that kept showing off her little laptop computer quote-unquote and it wasn't a

129
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:21,440
laptop computer so much as it was one of those computers that you get at Walmart

130
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:29,200
that's like you know my child's first computer I don't know how it's okay just

131
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,460
like have you ever seen the video player they sell at Walmart that they have the

132
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:38,240
CD and the tiny ass little screen that is really all black and white some of

133
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,720
them are all black why I think they have the color died I can't even think of the

134
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,440
name of these things but the tiny ass screen if you thought watching a movie

135
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:47,720
on your PSP was that these things have the tiniest screen in the world the

136
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:52,760
the quality just stinks, but this is, I don't know. Anyway, so she was showing off her computer

137
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:57,400
to me and kept asking questions about the PSP and I'm just like, leave me alone.

138
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:01,440
You pretended you didn't speak English. That's what I need to do next time.

139
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:06,340
To bludgeon her to death with the PSP. That's why I need to go see that movie, Red

140
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:10,960
Eye, because maybe I'll get some ideas from that movie for the next time I go. So we'll

141
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,280
see. I don't know if we should support any more

142
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:18,720
of Wes Craven's, uh, you know, stuff. I mean, come on. Do we need to really inspire him

143
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:23,400
to make more Nightmare on Elm Street movies? Yes, we do. Yes, we do. And we also need to

144
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:27,960
inspire him to make a Scream 4, because I didn't think that those movies were going

145
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:32,560
to be missed at all, but now that they're gone and there's really not been a lot of

146
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:37,120
good horror movies, I kind of miss them. Exactly. And what, what will a scary movie parody on

147
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:43,360
if they don't make any more screen movies I don't know I don't know all

148
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,640
right anyway um let's start off tonight show us we do every week with a little

149
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:51,280
bit of how is your week how is your day starting off with the one and only dark

150
00:19:51,280 --> 00:20:00,800
Sakura my week was busy busy busy at work I really have been trying to get

151
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,320
stuff together because I'm starting school next week so I didn't really get

152
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:10,080
play too much except for a little PSO and trying to get Ragnarok to install, but for

153
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,400
some reason the Korean Ragnarok won't install on my computer.

154
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,920
Is it because it's Korean?

155
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,560
Possibly, honestly.

156
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:20,860
I think that they've upgraded on the newest build, so I need a really old build of it.

157
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:25,680
I seem to recall that the Korean, because I think you tried to get me, no, who tried

158
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,120
to get me to install this once?

159
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,480
Somebody was getting me to install the Korean one so that I could patch it to play on a

160
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,480
free server.

161
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:37,820
style because he's all into that if you think a Loki is a pirate hey hang out

162
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:41,980
with lanky style sometime this would this see the written you read Ragnarok

163
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:46,780
online it's so advanced it bans you before you even decide the play stop it

164
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:51,100
anyway I don't want to cut off dark Sakura but I tried to install it once it

165
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:54,860
was a pain in the ass like I had to do all these special things can't initialize

166
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:58,860
So I need to figure out how to get past that.

167
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:02,860
Anyway, it's just really been...

168
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:06,860
I can't find my Illustrator book, which means I might have to buy another one

169
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:10,860
if I can't find it by Monday. Like Adobe Illustrator? Yeah, because one of my classes

170
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:14,860
is Illustrator, the other one is Geography, and then halfway through the next semester

171
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:18,860
I'm taking Dreamweaver and

172
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:22,860
what's the other...oh yeah, my other technical writing class

173
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:26,400
with a teacher who says I have flawless writing. Which means Dark Soccer is going to be doing

174
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,880
our site and all the graphics as soon as she graduates school.

175
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:35,000
Maybe before then. Or the Orange Lounge site might start becoming homework for me.

176
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,340
Um, also, um, sort of a half plug for Pump Up the Volume.

177
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:43,420
Um, in a couple weeks I'm going to be, uh,

178
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:46,060
doing a demo for Dark Records.

179
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:50,780
They just went live this week and, uh, but, you know, friends of mine are behind that.

180
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:53,180
And since I always try to play new music for everybody.

181
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:56,080
We can say the familiar DDR face that's behind a lot of this, right?

182
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:03,280
Well, my iguana girl is working with them, but they're people that, you know, I used to work with one of them.

183
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:08,280
I haven't, I think a lot of this has developed while I was kind of on vacation and tuned out of the world,

184
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:11,480
but so what's going on there? They're making their own label type thing?

185
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:17,180
It's a label. They're putting out the first record as a compilation of just different artists in the community.

186
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:21,660
So I'm going to be playing all that since I play new music on my show when I can.

187
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:23,740
Right, and isn't it like Synthpop, some of it?

188
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:25,420
Some Synthpop, Goth Industrial.

189
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:25,980
Cool.

190
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:29,740
Pretty, pretty variant stuff across the Angst written level.

191
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:33,020
So possible UltraMix 4 music, some way.

192
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:33,500
Maybe.

193
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,620
You never know, you never know.

194
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:35,340
Well that's kind of cool.

195
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:38,620
All the rest of it, we bought furniture today.

196
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:44,940
Dan bribed me with a bass guitar, which I'm not getting, I'm going to have,

197
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:47,740
I'm actually going to pay a trainer instead.

198
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:49,900
How exactly do you get bribed with a bass guitar?

199
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:53,180
Because I like the furniture first because it's red suede.

200
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:55,860
But we ended up buying it anyway.

201
00:22:55,860 --> 00:23:01,700
We got a big chaise lounge and an AI couch and we're going to get back and get end tables

202
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:02,700
for it and everything.

203
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,980
It's comfy and suede.

204
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:07,460
And the cat is not allowed anywhere near it.

205
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:09,160
And Shermy stopped puking.

206
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,160
That's good.

207
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,160
What happened with your kitty?

208
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,160
Cat flew.

209
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,160
We think she had West Nile.

210
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:20,800
Someone I know had it. Really? Yes. Oh my gosh. She said it felt like having

211
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:24,880
like a regular, you know, head flu and the stomach flu at the same time. For those that

212
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,880
are outside the Sacramento area, this has been big news. No, it's all over the country.

213
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,600
Oh, I thought it was just Sacramento had a problem. Oh, no, no. One of my good friends

214
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:37,440
lives in the D.C. area. She knew people who had it. Really? They're spraying out there

215
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,040
too and the spray makes her sick. I thought the spray was only happening out here. No,

216
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,480
This is all over the country.

217
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,280
Oh, dang.

218
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,200
Shows how much I know.

219
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,880
And typically in more humid areas, but still.

220
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,520
That would not be Sacramento.

221
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,480
I know, but we also do have a floodplain.

222
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,800
And standing water does pool.

223
00:23:55,800 --> 00:24:00,560
But anyway, what I was trying to say about that

224
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,440
is I don't know if it's possible.

225
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:06,080
Maybe Shirmi might have had some type of variant or something,

226
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,800
because she would eat, and then throw up, and then

227
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,080
cry pathetically.

228
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,760
You want to hear something really gross about what I got from a bug once?

229
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,760
What?

230
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:17,600
Okay, I once fell asleep on my couch, like out in the living room or something.

231
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,900
This was when I was living in Chico.

232
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,640
And I think I fell asleep with my mouth like open.

233
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,560
You know how some people like have their mouths open a little bit?

234
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:27,360
Well, I think a bug got in there and bit me on my gums.

235
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:32,160
Because the next day my gums swelled up hella big, and like they were like bleeding and

236
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,160
stuff.

237
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,680
And it's, like imagine if you didn't brush your teeth for like a year.

238
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:39,420
Sounds like, you're almost describing scurvy.

239
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:46,000
I caught scurvy and see deficiency Wow and your teeth start falling out and

240
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,660
your gums start to buzz you know my teeth didn't fall out and everything

241
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:52,560
went away like three days later but it was really disgusting during the process

242
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,520
and that was the only thing I could think of is that I must have been bitten

243
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:58,480
by bug because he gets I there was one part of it was slightly swollen so I

244
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,260
think it was a bug bite it was like very much similar to a mosquito bite it's

245
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:05,760
really good icky poo yeah anyway just thought I'd share fun enjoy that lovely

246
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:14,520
image America um otherwise I had just been busy busy busy busy sorry no that's

247
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:19,480
all right I've been sleepy all day I had coffee I didn't do anything I slept for 12

248
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:26,720
hours last night mr. jet lag yeah well not just that but the fact that I was up

249
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,760
from 1 a.m. West Coast time now granted I got to sleep for about an hour and a

250
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:33,760
half on the plane but I stayed up till midnight last night so it's almost up

251
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:39,520
like 24 hours, almost. So, I was definitely on second wind last night. Anyway, anything

252
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,520
else, DarkSakura?

253
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,520
No.

254
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,400
Okay. Loki, how was your week? How was your day?

255
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:51,080
My week was okay. It started off actually decent. I don't know, I could say my week

256
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:55,260
has been okay. Nellie's week has been kind of on the rocks. First, she started off her

257
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:57,280
week by having her car stolen.

258
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,280
That sucks.

259
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:03,280
And, yeah, so I've had to drive her around places and stuff. And then, she found a wedding

260
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:08,840
dress yesterday so that was kind of cool and otherwise what I've been doing this

261
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:14,640
week has been utilizing the internet for my advantage that's the best way to put

262
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:19,080
it and because of that I have gotten to play so many damn games it's not even

263
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:25,920
funny and oh yesterday I went and bought a DVD burner because I had to upgrade my

264
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:31,400
pirating ability to be able to burn DVDs that and just I need it for wedding

265
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:37,740
stuff as well. And then, so I had to install my CD burner into my mom's computer, which

266
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:43,500
I'm sure she'll be grateful for, but she won't know how to use. And, yeah, it's pretty much

267
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:48,820
been that, and I signed up for Usenet, and I got to download files and porn it ten times

268
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:49,820
faster than normal.

269
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:54,420
It took you this long to get on. Usenet, by the way, has been around for, what, fifteen

270
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:55,420
years? So you're finally on board?

271
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:59,220
Yeah, but, see, the only thing that I hesitated about Usenet is because it costs money. It's

272
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:04,640
$15 a month for the service that I have which is unlimited but it's unlimited

273
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:10,640
bandwidth but it's like $14.95 a month and then the weather server thing I'm on

274
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:18,660
which is a basically a list is 50 cents a month I think and so you know I just

275
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:22,520
basically sign up for that I'm gonna try it out for a month you know if it's

276
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:25,380
something I'm interested in then yeah I'll go for probably not though because

277
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:29,820
they don't have everything I'm looking for on there and just you know it's nice

278
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:35,040
because I get I can download files really fast but you know I I love it by

279
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:39,620
the way that you refuse to pay for anything but you'll pay for the program

280
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:44,900
to let you buy all this software. But if you think about it though because I I've been

281
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:48,240
like trying to get I'm speaking of which I'm getting back into the music stuff I

282
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,940
bought two sample CDs I bought one sample CD from BT which is $100 I bought

283
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:58,220
another one or I'm bidding on one that started off at $39.99 I don't get you

284
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:01,580
because when you do spend money you spend like a hundred dollars on a

285
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:08,780
fucking CD two CDs oh my bad my bad two CDs well it's because I can't get it

286
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:13,700
anywhere else it's no longer being made it's not on anywhere trust me I've

287
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:18,260
looked at all the free angles for this first before I go and actually buy

288
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:22,100
something like this they're just not selling it anymore so I want to get

289
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:27,100
Because BT's the fucking man when it comes to, you know, awesome break beats and that type of stuff.

290
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:31,100
And so I have, like, one CD's basically all drum loops and stuff.

291
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:34,100
The other one's all kind of like, you know, ambient sound kind of crap.

292
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:39,100
So I got those. Well, I got the one at least. I don't know about the other one. I still have to wait on that.

293
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:45,100
And then just pretty much waiting for that stuff to come in and audio software stuff, which is worth over $2,000.

294
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:51,100
Anyways, but I'm merely trying it out. I will delete it after 24 hours.

295
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,400
Yeah, sure you will. Yeah, okay.

296
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,200
No, but honestly, um, what a load of crap is that, too?

297
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:00,200
Who said that that is a law, that you can download the program as long as you delete it within 24 hours?

298
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,200
Somebody made that shit up, you know it.

299
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:05,600
I'm- I'm just trying this stuff out. I mean, yeah.

300
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:09,100
So, I've- I've been having a lot of fun with my HD loader, and that's all I have to say.

301
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:14,800
I still think that you should tell all those people who say that using acid sucks to go, you know, bite your ass or something.

302
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:18,100
Well, that's why I'm gonna create some good music with acid.

303
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:20,100
Bite you with the good samples, because I'm lazy.

304
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:25,100
There was my point though. DJ Danger Mouse uses acid.

305
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:32,100
Absolutely. For those that don't, or are kind of newer listeners to this show that don't know about the acid debate,

306
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,100
Bimani Style once had a remix contest a while ago.

307
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,100
They have a remix contest going on now.

308
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:39,100
Well, they don't have anything going on now because their site's been down a couple of days.

309
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:41,100
It was up this morning.

310
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:45,100
Maybe it's up again. I don't know. But anyway, they had a remix contest a while back and they said,

311
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:49,560
said no mashups and nothing done in acid type thing right and so come to find out

312
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:54,020
like a bunch of popular DJ shoes acid we got MIDI head on the show asked him how

313
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:59,860
he did his remixes for Ultramix 2 and he said acid now to be fair he else sees

314
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:04,180
his free loops but who can buy they're both the same damn program I mean

315
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:10,340
honestly they're very similar so who cares but yeah so that's basically is my

316
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:13,860
my week it's been a lot of downloading and a lot of Nelly yelling at me get

317
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:20,860
Question from chat, are you still relenting over graffiti kingdom?

318
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:49,340
a very interesting day because I left Philadelphia in the morning. I stopped in Phoenix for a

319
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:53,340
three hour layover. I ended up doing lunch with our webmaster, VX JasonXV, because I

320
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:57,860
happen to be in Phoenix. So that's just kind of neat. I did lunch in Phoenix and then came

321
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:02,780
home. So it was an interesting day yesterday. Of course, I've been doing a lot of work related,

322
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:07,340
and when I say work, I mean my actual day job. You know I actually had somebody, a recent

323
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:11,380
person that I added to LiveJournal recently, like a recent LiveJournal friend, asked if

324
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:15,180
I did the podcasting thing for a living because I talked so much about it. I was like, oh,

325
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:23,620
I wish. I wish we did the podcasting for a living. But no, I haven't quite quit my job.

326
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:29,020
Never mind. I'll say it after the show. All right. So what was I going to say along

327
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:33,620
those lines? Oh, so I have a real job and my real job sent me away for two weeks because

328
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:40,460
I had some stuff I had to do in the Philadelphia area. So while I was out there, I ended up

329
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:46,220
getting to go to a tournament in Jersey at 8 on the Break in Dunellen, a little town

330
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:50,060
there. So I went there and it was actually an In the Groove 2 tournament. Actually they

331
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:53,320
had a lot of games going on, but when I got there it was kind of In the Groove 2 Perfect

332
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:57,480
Attack was going on. So I actually got to see In the Groove 2. Now I promised the folks

333
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:01,080
at home I would actually get a chance to play In the Groove 2 while I was gone. Sorry kids

334
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:05,000
that didn't happen. There were so many people at this tournament. And the way that 8 on

335
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:11,920
on the break is kind of set up. It's really hard to get kind of close to the machine when

336
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:15,000
there's all those people in there because the area... It's kind of like when they have

337
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,920
tournaments at Sunnyvale Golfland, to put it in perspective for you guys. Like there's

338
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:23,060
aisles in between the machines. They didn't really have... And that kind of surprised

339
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:26,320
me because I kind of thought, well, they have this area with the pool tables. Why don't

340
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:30,120
they take the machine and move it into the back area where there's all this extra room

341
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:34,820
and move the pool tables around? But for whatever reason, they didn't do that. So I got to

342
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:38,860
see in the Groove 2, but I didn't get to play it. And when I saw it, I was just kind of

343
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:43,260
like, well, it's basically in the Groove 1 with different music and a red interface.

344
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:48,980
That's pretty much, I was like, okay, whatever, I don't really get a huge deal. But in a way,

345
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:52,900
that's also the exact same thing you could say about Max 2 versus Max, is that it was

346
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:56,420
just, you know, more songs and a red interface. So I'm not going to fault the game for that.

347
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:59,380
But I can't really give you a full review of the game until I actually play it. So I

348
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:03,660
will withhold judgment of In the Groove 2 for a little while. But I didn't get a chance

349
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:06,700
to play. But I will say this, this is what I thought was interesting about the DDR tournament

350
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:10,940
on the East Coast. I didn't know anybody there except a couple people, and I'll get into

351
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:14,380
that in a minute. I didn't know like anybody there, so it was really weird for me because

352
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:17,740
usually when I go to DDR tournaments on the West Coast, I've been doing this for so long

353
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:21,060
that I recognize a lot of the people there, and you know, it's kind of cool, but it was

354
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:23,500
really weird going to the East Coast because nobody knew who I was, I didn't know who anybody

355
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:28,500
was. And I was kind of like, I was kind of tired because I had a lot going on from the

356
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:31,260
night before and stuff, just you know, work and everything, so I didn't really feel like

357
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:34,920
being a social butterfly so it's just kind of lurking and you know what I

358
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:37,340
think is interesting about DDR tournaments on the East Coast just like

359
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:41,180
ones on the West Coast is that once again there is that guy at the

360
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:45,720
tournament who really needs to learn about showering regularly and using

361
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:48,860
deodorant but you don't know who the offender is because there's so many

362
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:55,500
sweaty guys packed in a room together and you're like ah so that that doesn't

363
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:58,580
change West Coast to East Coast sorry I don't know what to tell you guys that

364
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:00,540
That doesn't change.

365
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:03,120
But otherwise, in all seriousness, I stayed at the tournament.

366
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,340
It looked like it was okay.

367
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:06,580
It looked like it was being pretty efficiently managed.

368
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:09,340
But in all honesty, I didn't end up staying much more than 20 minutes.

369
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:14,540
Like I mentioned, since you didn't get a chance to play In the Groove 2 at 8 on the break,

370
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:20,180
In the Groove 2 is actually at our local golf place, Paradise Island.

371
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:21,180
It just came in.

372
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:22,300
Did it officially get there?

373
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,300
Officially got there.

374
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,300
Interesting.

375
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,300
I might have to go check that out.

376
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:32,300
I have one more thing I forgot to say. Speaking of tournaments and arcades, Shaft 2 is happening.

377
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:41,100
I've got dates in mind, possible sponsorship from Gamestop. So in mid-November we're having

378
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:46,300
Shaft 2. Right on. Right on. And that will be, we'll definitely be a big sponsor of that

379
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:51,540
tournament, of course, and we'll be whoring that tournament out, and that will be sometime

380
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:55,060
in november is all we can say right now yes and working out and hopefully being

381
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:57,220
able to broadcast live

382
00:34:57,220 --> 00:35:01,140
basically shaft 2 is going to be uh... ddr tournament and bowling league

383
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:03,420
tournament

384
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:06,820
how's that going to work because there's no

385
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:10,660
well it is at a bowling alley so there are bowling lanes oh yes get it

386
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:14,660
it's at fireside lanes oh i didn't realize it was at bowling okay well that works

387
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:18,500
i mean obviously how are they going to do bowling in like a golf place

388
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:21,440
You know, actually we were going to do the tournament at Roseville Golf Land and we were

389
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:25,880
going to tie ten children down and roll a giant ball at them like you used to see on

390
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:29,240
Roll a katamari at them so that they stay stuck.

391
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:33,880
What was that old show they used to play on like USA which was like, you know, American

392
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:34,880
Gladiators?

393
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:38,800
Extreme Games with the Stars or whatever where they had the giant bowling ball and they'd

394
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,100
knock over all the people in the bowling pins.

395
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:44,200
That's what we were going to do with children.

396
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,120
No it is actually going to be the legit bowling alley.

397
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,120
And what will it be? DDR Extreme?

398
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,120
Yes, it's on an Extreme machine.

399
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,120
Alright.

400
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,120
So I'm working out details and I just gotta get people together.

401
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,120
Alright.

402
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:59,120
We should see if there's room to do some type of TV thing and bring in a home version of something.

403
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:02,120
Have like a... I wanna have like an Amplitude tournament.

404
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:04,120
We'll see. We'll see what works out.

405
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,120
Alright. That'd be fun.

406
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:11,120
But, you know, I'm not gonna have much time to work on it at the end of the month because of course I'm doing that whole getting married thing, so...

407
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:15,120
Well I will help you out and of course I'm sure Loki will too. I just volunteered you.

408
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:18,560
a crappy dance game tournament have an emcee

409
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,800

I do want to have a good attack tournament

414
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,280
we did that like it

415
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:37,280
or no it wasn't a good attack what was it that we did a miss attack

416
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,680
it was a miss attack tournament

417
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,440
what does Shaft stand for again?

418
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:45,880
uh... second as back to money which is going to be found that act

419
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,400

00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:01,880

427
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,400
another fireside tournament

428
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,400
Because we haven't done one before.

429
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,400
That doesn't work.

430
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,400
Host an awesome fireside tournament.

431
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,400
Alright.

432
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:21,400
I will see what I can do about buttering, because the chat room seems to be liking this idea of an amplitude tournament.

433
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:29,400
So I will see what I can do about buttering up the One and Only Dark Sakura to let us do not only an amplitude tournament, but some really horrible video game tournament.

434
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,400
I also may be coming into a copy of Rez.

435
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,400
Oh cool.

436
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,400
So maybe Rez tournament.

437
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,400
Or something. Can you really do a tournament on Rez?

438
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,400
Could try.

439
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:42,400
I will be hosting an unofficial Meteos tournament, so bring your DS. It's on.

440
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:47,400
Unofficial Meteos tournament. Anyway, more details on that come November.

441
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:52,400
Actually, no, we won't give you the details in November, or else you won't have time to plan.

442
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,400
More details to come, like, soon. As soon as we have details.

443
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,400
And we would love for people to come from all over to support this.

444
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,400
Absolutely. Later than now. Yes, later than now. Anyway.

445
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,400
People can crash in my playroom.

446
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:08,040
Back to the East Coast tournament. I didn't finish my story on the East Coast tournament.

447
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,040
Why?

448
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:13,320
I actually, no, it's alright. I cut you off. You can cut me off. It's fine. It's because

449
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:18,160
we love each other. Um, Dark Sakura has this look of disgust on her face.

450
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,280
No. No, that's okay.

451
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:25,400
Um, and I just saw Bush intent on change on my Yahoo, so I was like, uh, that was the

452
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,400
look of disgust.

453
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,400
You just saw Bush?

454
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:30,760
Bush intent on change. Social Security turns 70.

455
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,760
Hee hee!

456
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:32,760
Butt head! Anyway.

457
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:42,760
Anyway, yeah, okay, sorry, I've been gone for a couple of weeks, everything's funny.

458
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:47,080
Oh yeah, the tournament, I only ended up staying at this tournament for like 20 minutes because

459
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:53,720
I just, I wasn't competing and I was just kind of watching and observing and I didn't

460
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:57,400
know who to root for because I didn't know any of these people and I felt really bad

461
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:01,080
but also I just had other stuff going on so I just ended up leaving after like 20 minutes

462
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:03,440
Except I left with one of our listeners.

463
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,440
So that was the cool thing.

464
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:09,660
One of our listeners, Ron Chan, actually showed up at the tournament, and we left.

465
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:14,720
And we went to, with some of his other friends, we actually went to this girl's house who

466
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:19,200
lives in Jersey, and I'm so sorry, I forgot her name, I'm so horrible with names, but

467
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:23,040
she was very cool because she had us all over at her house, and we were all in her basement.

468
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:26,400
And they have, like, the most ginormous television I've ever seen in the basement.

469
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,920
Seriously, it was like an IMAX TV in her basement.

470
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:29,920
It was crazy.

471
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:34,320
And so, of course, we were all excited because we were going to play DDR on, like, the IMAX

472
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:38,360
TV, as I'm calling it, because it's a fucking huge TV.

473
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:42,080
And then, lo and behold, our PlayStation 2 wouldn't load anything.

474
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:49,480
We finally got DDR Extreme USA to work after a little bit, but no background movies, and

475
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,800
you had to wait, like, two minutes for the song to load.

476
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,960
That poor thing was busted.

477
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:56,760
I didn't even get a chance to play because the damn thing broke before, but it's all

478
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,760
right.

479
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:58,760
I had fun.

480
00:39:58,760 --> 00:39:59,760
I had fun just being around strangers.

481
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:06,600
my disk drive. That's why I use my hard drive. You know what I find ironic is all these people

482
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:12,800
complain about their disk drive not working and it going off the thing. I have a first

483
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:19,520
model JPS2 that's never had a problem. And on top of that the whole reason that the component

484
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:23,480
cable didn't work when we were trying to play Katamari at my house was because we didn't

485
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:27,860
have the visual setting set up for component. Oh yeah, I found that out too the first time

486
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:33,220
I tried to do component is that it wasn't set up right. Anyway, anyway, so yeah, we

487
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:37,200
were playing extreme for a little bit and then we just kind of just hung out, went to

488
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,460
a diner and ate and then left, went our several ways. And I went back to the tournament because

489
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:43,660
I thought, okay, the tournament should be over by now and I'll have a chance to play

490
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:49,420
in the groove too. So I can finally, you know, let Loki know how great it is. And lo and

491
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:52,780
behold, when I got back, the tournament was still going on and it looked like it was still

492
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:57,480
perfect attack. I think actually what I missed in the morning, they were doing like an exhibition.

493
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:02,200
they were setting up for freestyle, but I missed the actual competition itself.

494
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:07,280
And it still smelled like armpit when I got back, sorry to say.

495
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:10,520
But again, I'm not trying to pick on East Coast, because it's the same thing on the

496
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,520
West Coast.

497
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:15,800
I'm not trying to make a Jersey reference, are you?

498
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,800
Shut up!

499
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:21,400
Well you know why they built the Statue of Liberty facing the way it does?

500
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,200
It's ass-facing New Jersey.

501
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:28,520
No, actually, everybody bashes on New Jersey, but I rather liked it in New Jersey.

502
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,400
I thought New Jersey was a nice place.

503
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:35,320
I like New Jersey because that's where Jay and Silent Bob and Kevin Smith and all...

504
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:39,400
I went to Red Bank my last trip to Jersey, so this time I just kind of hung out in Dun

505
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,000
Ellen a little while longer.

506
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,520
I actually kind of like Jersey.

507
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:43,920
I don't know why people knock on it.

508
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:48,280
But from what I understand about Jersey, it's the big cities that suck.

509
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:53,040
Like Jersey City and, you know, the other big cities in New Jersey that are no fun.

510
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,120
I had a good time.

511
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,800
But you know what else?

512
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,000
I actually went into New York City on Saturday and just

513
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,160
walked around aimlessly for forever.

514
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:05,200
We just walked around the Chelsea district, wink, wink.

515
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:09,200
We walked around the area around Grand Central Station.

516
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,200
We walked around Union Square.

517
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,360
We walked around Times Square.

518
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:14,320
We just walked forever and ever.

519
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,880
Didn't get a chance to play any DDR in New York City.

520
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:17,600
But I loved New York City.

521
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,480
I had a great time.

522
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:23,000
And I'm totally thinking like, I should just move here.

523
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,760
But I know I won't. That's just the afterglow of a trip, you know?

524
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:30,120
I've been once and have not been inclined to go back for a long time.

525
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:33,480
This was 11 years ago.

526
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:37,400
The first time I went I was 17. But everything was too organized.

527
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:40,600
It was nice to go back and not have a plan and get to walk around just like everywhere.

528
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:43,880
It was great. I had a really good time. I think I'd have a better time.

529
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:47,640
But honestly, I don't like looking up and seeing building.

530
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:50,840
I like looking up and seeing a tree and sky

531
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:53,320
and breathing air that's not full of dirt.

532
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,320
It didn't bother me.

533
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,320
It didn't bother me.

534
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,320
But this is the weird thing.

535
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:59,380
I hate San Francisco for that exact reason you're mentioning.

536
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:01,160
New York City, I loved.

537
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:02,160
I don't know why.

538
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,160
I think it's...

539
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,160
Well, no, no, no.

540
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,160
I do know why, actually.

541
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:06,160
It was the people.

542
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,320
There was a lot of just neat-looking people and neat-looking things.

543
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:13,480
I went to the Toys R Us in Times Square, which was awesome.

544
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:14,480
The Toys R Us in Times Square.

545
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,920
I've never been to such a cool-looking Toys R Us.

546
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:18,480
Did you eat at Ruxy?

547
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:19,480
No.

548
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:20,480
That place is awesome.

549
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:23,680
We walked around for forever and ended up eating at some diner called like moon

550
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:27,040
Moon struck because I remember making a joke about the Cher movie

551
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:29,380
It was a diner called moon struck that we ate at but anyway

552
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:33,080
We went to Times Square Toys R Us huge

553
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:36,800
There's like a ferris wheel inside the place, but in the basement is like the game area

554
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:38,340
It was so cool

555
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:43,380
Like they had demos for all these upcoming games was almost like going to e3 like they have the Nintendogs demo

556
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:48,680
They had a bunch of other demos and it was I didn't realize the Nintendogs demo was like everywhere at this point in a lot

557
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:52,200
of stores because I saw it at Best Buy the other day, but I just, I loved the setup there

558
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:56,720
and it was not an overpriced Toys R Us. You would think that the Times Square would have

559
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:00,400
overpriced games, but it was pretty much the same thing they'd charge in any, you know,

560
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:03,880
mall or anything. So I had a really good time. I do want to go back and spend more time in

561
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:08,240
the city. Moving there, I think that's just kind of a joke. I don't think I would actually

562
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:09,240
be...

563
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:10,680
That would be highly unrealistic because it's...

564
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:18,560
It's expensive to live there. So we'll see. Anyway. Do do do do do. So I guess that's about

565
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:23,500
it. You know what? You know what's funny? Somebody in our chat room, Sephiroth1215 actually

566
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:28,340
said, brought up the Chinatown in the Groove 2 machine. I found out about that after I

567
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:32,940
left New York City because Bronma, DJronmaS told me about it, was showing me pictures

568
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:37,280
of the machine, and I'm kind of sad. I could have gone to Chinatown and actually played

569
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:42,260
in the Groove 2, but my friend who I was with doesn't really get the whole DDR thing. Like,

570
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:46,080
she likes games and all, but she doesn't get my obsession with DDR, so I don't think she

571
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:50,360
she would have gone for it. Let's go all the way to Chinatown to play a funny dancy game.

572
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:54,400
She wouldn't have gone for it. Love her to death, but we just have different interests

573
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:58,520
in that regard. So anyway, that's me. That's my big bloated story about my week and my

574
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:02,320
weekend. But the tournament, it seemed like there was a lot of good people and I swear

575
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:06,080
if I go back, I will be more friendly next time in the next tournament. I will wear this

576
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:10,960
big shirt for Orange Lounge Radio or something so that people might connect me with it or

577
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:15,000
something. Just like, caution Dr. Dick. Or yeah, I should just go on Dr. Dick garb or

578
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,120
something but seriously this time I dress I just blend it in I was just

579
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:21,520
not a kid at the thing although really probably I'm probably the oldest person

580
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:27,680
that was there but um you know I swear next time I go all all but I I have

581
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:30,840
some time off around the Labor Day but there's too much going on around that

582
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:35,280
time where I might not be able to go so we'll see yeah cuz someone you know is

583
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:38,840
getting married I do but I need to find out when the reception is because I can

584
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:46,760
playing around it the next weekend all right anyway let's go to a break now

585
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:50,680
now see everybody on the East Coast is as telling me all these machines all

586
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:54,520
these in the groove two machines I could have gone to play thanks guys this is

587
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:57,240
good to find out about after the fact now somebody's saying you should go to

588
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:04,280
Coney Island all right let's go to a break in this break we're gonna hear

589
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:07,800
some requests from the chat room and when we come back we're gonna talk about

590
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:14,800
We're gonna talk about DDR with Fire, and we're gonna talk about some other things that have been going on in the DDR scene, and we'll talk about whatever else we feel like talking about.

591
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:20,800
We'll be back after this. We're gonna start it off with a request. We actually had a couple In the Groove song requests, so we'll get those out of the way.

592
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:24,800
Oh, this is good too because we want to hear about Loki's experience with In the Groove.

593
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:29,800
Because you teased something a while back. What did you tease the listeners with? That you were going to rent it or that you rented it but hadn't played it?

594
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:37,800
I have it, and I've played it, and I was going to tell you my thoughts on it, and we're going to see if they've changed.

595
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:39,800
Okay, that's the first thing I've ever read.

596
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:43,800
Because it's very possible that they might have changed, and I could be an in-the-group lover.

597
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:46,800
And then again, Angels could be real also, but...

598
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:52,800
You know what, though? Now, you posted in your Live Turtle something this week about an Apple product, and that you liked it.

599
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:55,800
The G6 or something, right? Wasn't it? Or something?

600
00:46:55,800 --> 00:47:01,480
It was the netBSP Linux toaster. It was the Linux toaster.

601
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:07,080
I was on dial-up. I couldn't follow links. So, wait. There was something Apple related.

602
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:10,600
You confessed to liking a lot. There was two. There was two things I posted

603
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:13,400
in my Live Year Old. There's one that said this, that they're only

604
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:16,880
viable use for an Apple iPod. And it was a story about a woman bludgeoning

605
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:19,180
her boyfriend. Which was fake.

606
00:47:19,180 --> 00:47:21,400
With an iPod. Okay. And then... If you look, it was on the rumor

607
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:28,400
And then the second one was a picture of the Apple G6 and it was the Linux toaster.

608
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:33,400
Because we all know that the Apple has the processing power of a toaster.

609
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:34,400
I hate you.

610
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:37,400
I was bored that day, okay?

611
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:39,400
We'll be back with Loki's thoughts on a degree.

612
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:43,400
Honestly, I am sick and tired of the stupid Apple thing.

613
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:45,400
Okay, granted, we know that I don't like them.

614
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:48,400
Do we really need to constantly bring this up that I don't like them?

615
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,400
Because it gets old.

616
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:57,400
nope doesn't get old

617
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,400
I'm calling you

618
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:31,400
Shadows have been fed by

619
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:35,400
The red and tattered and I

620
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:37,400
Will love you

621
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,400
Forever

622
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:46,400
I'm telling you now but why

623
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:49,400
I'm taking so long to die

624
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:51,400
I miss you

625
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:55,400
Forever

626
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:57,400
Here on me

627
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:59,400
Clean up life

628
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:01,400
Walk me through the night

629
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:03,400
And deep inside

630
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:05,400
The ceiling are hurting

631
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,400
Clean up life

632
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,400
Tell me why

633
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:11,400
If you hide

634
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:13,400
Down behind the curtain

635
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:17,400
High, high, high, high, high, high, high, high, high

636
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:24,400
Can you see me falling high, high, high, high, high, high, high, high

637
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:27,600
Can you hear me calling you?

638
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,400
I'm the recognition

639
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:29,400
I'm falling in love

640
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:31,400
I'm falling in love

641
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:33,400
Let's take it from the top, keep moving, moving

642
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:35,400
The beat is real swift, it's grooving

643
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:37,400
Rob is here, put it in gear, lean your head

644
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:39,400
Cause the beat is real funky, tread

645
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:40,400
Let's rock and roll with soul

646
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:41,400
I hold the mic and go

647
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:42,400
Cause Rob is in full control

648
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,400
Mainstaying the game the same

649
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,400
And what I see for rhyme for rhyme will now be blank

650
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,400
I'm the recognition

651
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:51,400
I'm falling in love

652
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:25,400
Don't stop the pain

653
00:52:51,400 --> 00:53:18,760
I'll do it all night, do it with me I'll do it all night, do it with me

654
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:23,760
Do it with me, I'll take you to heaven if you make me feel free, babe

655
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:26,760
Do it tonight, do it alright

656
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:31,760
Just take me and shake me till I burn up inside, no

657
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:49,240
You may have complex and some incredible tricks and maxes

658
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:52,480
You may be the slave of Tim and Tom and Ed and Dave

659
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:55,800
You may do it again with handsome friends and check and care

660
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:59,160
But you're gonna feel so free when you do it in the name

661
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:06,160
Do it all night, do it with me, I'll take you to heaven if you make me feel free, baby

662
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:13,160
Do it tonight, do it alright, just take me and shake me till I burn up inside, oh

663
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:19,160
Do it all night, do it with me, hard as a fire with a straw and a tree

664
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:26,160
Do it tonight, do it alright You got it, I knew it, you can do it tonight

665
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:37,160
You're the home of the fire, the straw in the tree

666
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:51,720
Come on, do it with me.

667
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:57,080
Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song, Orange Lounge Radio.

668
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:59,560
Well, back boys and girls, here on Orange Lounge Radio.

669
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:03,120
On that break, you heard some varying music there that was either inspired by

670
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:07,720
by chat or requested outright by chat. Queen of Light there from In the Groove, a minute

671
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:14,320
from DDR Max 2. And I know that Rini who requested that song actually wanted to hear the original

672
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:18,400
like old ass version. It only takes a minute. But I couldn't find it. I could have sworn

673
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:22,040
it was in that giant potpourri directory that I got from your computer, which I think in

674
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:25,560
turn came from Iguana Girl's computer. I don't know why that would have been in there since

675
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:31,560
that's the original. I don't know. Wasn't there one in like way old ass DDR? No. I thought

676
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:34,560
The original was never in DDR.

677
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:37,560
I thought it was. I thought it was in like an old-ass mix of DDR.

678
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:38,560
No, never.

679
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:40,560
Sorry, my memory's fading as I'm getting old.

680
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:42,560
Summer in Belize from In the Groove 2.

681
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:45,560
That was actually the first time I really listened to that song.

682
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:47,560
Not Too Shabby, I liked that one. That was pretty cool.

683
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:51,560
Erotic from DDR3rd makes do it all night because the chat room was talking about Erotic.

684
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:54,560
Somebody actually asked what the Dr. Dick thing was all about,

685
00:55:54,560 --> 00:56:00,560
and even though I couldn't really play this song because it's a little bit longer,

686
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:09,520
It was actually kind of inspired by an old erotic song called Help Me Dr. Dick, is where

687
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:11,800
that monkey comes from, the Dr. Dick name.

688
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:24,680
And it's my improv freestyle alter ego, let me play a little clip of the song.

689
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:30,040
There we go, so that's the song from Erotic and that's where it came from.

690
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:35,080
Anyway, the chat room is swearing up and down that that was in third mix. Let me check my

691
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:40,840
DDR in a minute. I could swear that... I thought I'd played the original one in DDR before,

692
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:44,320
it's just been so long, and it's not, to be honest kids, it's not really one of my favorite

693
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:48,440
songs. I'll just check, step mania doesn't count, I'll check my home version. Holy crap,

694
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:54,440
here it is, wait, I have the third mix soundtrack. You got it? Here it is. That's right, that's

695
00:56:54,440 --> 00:57:04,440
I have to think of this, because I was singing of a different one by them.

696
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:07,440
It's one of those ones I just never freaking played because I didn't like the song. Sorry

697
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:11,440
kids. I love this song. I didn't like it. Sorry kids. It's one of those ones I always

698
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:17,960
skipped. Alright, so we fucked up. Leave us alone. We're allowed to make a mistake once

699
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:23,800
in a while. Alright, anyway, let's take a minute. We're going to have Loki's review

700
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:28,880
you now of In The Groove? Loki, you were mentioning that you, did you rent or you bought In The

701
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:36,520
Groove? Or you acquired In The Groove? I, let me just say I played In The Groove, how

702
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:42,520
about that? We'll leave it at that. Okay. Because I consider it a waste of space, I'm

703
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:47,400
gonna, you know, use it as a waste, basically say it's a waste of space on my hard drive.

704
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:54,400
But anyways, um, so yes, I played it in the groove, I booted it up, tried it, you know,

705
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:58,800
said, okay, what's the big deal about this game, played it for a good, you know, a good

706
00:57:58,800 --> 00:57:59,800
half an hour.

707
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:03,660
I definitely gave a couple songs a try.

708
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:06,500
My opinion of this game has not changed one bit.

709
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:07,760
It still sucks ass.

710
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:10,620
And now I have played it, I can say it sucks ass.

711
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:14,060
You know, and I'm still debating on buying an actual copy of the game so I can write

712
00:58:14,060 --> 00:58:20,940
this game sucks ass so we can give it away. But I have, you know, I've thought about it,

713
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:25,180
I have thought about it and, you know, right now, $45 could be better spent somewhere else.

714
00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:30,700
So I'm going to wait for the game to go to the bargain bin. It's just, it's, you know,

715
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:35,700
I, I played the game. I, I played it for a while. You know, I unlocked a couple songs.

716
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:39,020
What kind of songs did you play when you played it? Did you, were there any catchy songs you

717
00:58:39,020 --> 00:58:43,620
liked at all? I honestly, I can't even, they're forgettable. That's how, that's how bad this

718
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:48,380
game is. I played a few things. I was just kind of going down the list. And I don't remember

719
00:58:48,380 --> 00:58:52,460
what songs I played when I played them. But the step charts to me seemed like something

720
00:58:52,460 --> 00:58:56,780
I saw like on Bomani's style in their sim file section. Like some idiot, just any idiot

721
00:58:56,780 --> 00:59:01,380
made them up. They weren't that great. I mean, and I was playing on the most difficult settings

722
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:07,100
so I was just, you know, okay, expecting something really cool. No. I never got it. And okay,

723
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:12,100
wow, there's so many modifiers. Does nothing for me. You know, that's just like saying,

724
00:59:12,100 --> 00:59:15,620
oh look you know cereal comes in multiple colors doesn't matter to me I

725
00:59:15,620 --> 00:59:15,940
mean

726
00:59:15,940 --> 00:59:19,900
okay to play devil's advocate here a little bit okay what's so freaking great

727
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:21,340
about the our home releases then

728
00:59:21,340 --> 00:59:25,260
what's so great about the the music for one all their music in in the group

729
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:28,160
sounded like some just

730
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:31,860
amateurs a very very amateur no sounding music

731
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:34,900
I'm granted license stuff with okay

732
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:37,940
I mean it was okay but it wasn't stand out it was just

733
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:41,060
I mean it's forgettable the entire game is forgettable

734
00:59:41,060 --> 00:59:43,620
That's pretty much what it comes down to.

735
00:59:43,620 --> 00:59:48,540
I mean, you'd think that I'd be, you know, ranting and raving about this game, but even

736
00:59:48,540 --> 00:59:50,900
the unlocked songs were just whoopity-doo.

737
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:52,780
I mean, it wasn't that great.

738
00:59:52,780 --> 00:59:56,540
And I saw the preview songs for In the Groove 2 on there.

739
00:59:56,540 --> 00:59:57,540
Wow.

740
00:59:57,540 --> 01:00:01,700
I'm glad to say that they've sure not stepped up.

741
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:04,140
You know, it's interesting you didn't even like the unlocks, because I would say probably

742
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:08,860
my favorite In the Groove song with, I think, some of the most fun steps is one of the unlocks,

743
01:00:08,860 --> 01:00:09,860
Anubis.

744
01:00:09,860 --> 01:00:17,860
I know that song's horrid, sorry guys, but I think it's like the most fun with steps.

745
01:00:17,860 --> 01:00:21,060
It's right up there with some of the great DDR songs, in my opinion, just the way the

746
01:00:21,060 --> 01:00:23,500
steps are designed to go with the song.

747
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:26,100
It's so much fun to dance to, I think, that particular song.

748
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:29,780
But remember, I don't hate In the Groove with a Passion like you do.

749
01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:31,660
You know, I was trying to give it a fair shot.

750
01:00:31,660 --> 01:00:36,140
I was going into it and saying, okay, I've knocked on this game enough, let me see what

751
01:00:36,140 --> 01:00:38,820
it is, because maybe I could be wrong about it.

752
01:00:38,820 --> 01:00:44,340
I'm afraid I was not wrong about it. It's just, it sucks. It's a crappy game. It's what

753
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:48,300
it comes down to. I mean, it's another music game. Granted, if you're really starving for

754
01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:54,180
music games, go play it. But I'm not starving for music games, so I'm not gonna play it.

755
01:00:54,180 --> 01:00:58,940
That's what it's gonna come down to. And I just didn't like it. To me, the whole game

756
01:00:58,940 --> 01:01:04,500
seemed like, you know, it seemed very, very amateur. It seemed like just some guy made

757
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:10,300
some homebrew stuff, got some company to publish it for them, and boom! There's the game. Well,

758
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:11,700
that's pretty much what happened anyway.

759
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:13,860
I was going to say, that's kind of what happened anyway, but...

760
01:01:13,860 --> 01:01:18,940
But there's just not the polish in there. It's just that, and even In the Groove 2,

761
01:01:18,940 --> 01:01:19,940
there's not...

762
01:01:19,940 --> 01:01:23,180
You're not going to give them a break on the polish thing, considering it's their first

763
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:28,780
mix they've ever done, Red Octane's first game they've published, Roxor's only important

764
01:01:28,780 --> 01:01:32,060
game they've ever done, et cetera, et cetera? You're not going to give them a break?

765
01:01:32,060 --> 01:01:35,220
I'm even talking about In the Groove 2. No polish on this game.

766
01:01:35,220 --> 01:01:38,820
It's like, wow, we changed the air face to red. Whoop-a-dee-doo!

767
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:41,300
Okay, you can change it to green, it releases it to green.

768
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:43,060
There's a little more they did to In the Groove 2.

769
01:01:43,060 --> 01:01:47,540
And like I said, honestly, at first they added ugly characters, I'm sorry.

770
01:01:47,540 --> 01:01:52,180
You know what, as much as I'm trying to play devil's advocate for In the Groove here,

771
01:01:52,180 --> 01:01:53,660
because I do think the game's alright,

772
01:01:53,660 --> 01:01:56,740
the characters thing is kinda, yeah, lame.

773
01:01:56,740 --> 01:02:01,340
But In the Groove 2 and In the Groove 1

774
01:02:01,340 --> 01:02:05,480
really feels to me, just from observer, remember I haven't played the game yet so I'm not going

775
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:08,980
to give a full review on the game until I actually play it, but from a glance, from

776
01:02:08,980 --> 01:02:13,500
looking at it, it doesn't look any different from Max 2 to Max 1. And let's not forget

777
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:16,520
Max 2 was actually a real improvement over Max 1. But what did they do? They changed

778
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:20,020
the interface to Reb. Whoopee shit! And added some songs. But the game itself was...

779
01:02:20,020 --> 01:02:24,300
Well they also added non-stops and stuff, I think. Or Oni. Wasn't Oni in the...

780
01:02:24,300 --> 01:02:25,700
Well, marathons and in the groove.

781
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:35,700
Well, they have that on their show. I don't know. Whatever. But still, though, I mean, come on now. It's... I don't know. I even... It's just, it wasn't for me.

782
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:41,700
Alright, boys and girls, if you disagree with Loki, we will give you a chance to, uh, present your opinion.

783
01:02:41,700 --> 01:02:53,700
Well, you know, so what? You disagree. Big deal. I mean, I gave it a shot. It wasn't like, you know, I'm talking about nothing here. I actually played the game. So, you know, what are you gonna say? Oh, so you don't like it. You're wrong. No, actually, it's my opinion, so I'm right.

784
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:57,620
It's just, you know, it's just not a very good game.

785
01:02:57,620 --> 01:03:02,260
You know, whatever. I mean, I don't like pump it up either that much.

786
01:03:02,260 --> 01:03:05,620
Granted, that game is better than In the Groove because

787
01:03:05,620 --> 01:03:08,940
they've put more polish into the game. Granted, I think the crazy mode is

788
01:03:08,940 --> 01:03:09,900
retarded, but

789
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:13,420
you know, the dance sequences are fun

790
01:03:13,420 --> 01:03:16,980
and the music is okay. It's different. And

791
01:03:16,980 --> 01:03:21,220
I don't know, the background movies are actually good, whereas In the Groove is kinda

792
01:03:21,220 --> 01:03:25,600
playing but you know I will actually go on the record saying and keep in mind I

793
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:29,440
haven't played many pump it up games in the arcade I've played a very various

794
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:35,560
amount I actually think in the grooves better than pump it up I hate pump it up

795
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:40,280
interface with a passion I hate it it ruins almost the whole damn game for me

796
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:43,120
to be honest the music is kind of hit and miss there's some great songs and

797
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:48,100
pump it up but a few more misses than hits for me I can't play the same six

798
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:52,100
I can play In The Groove a little bit longer, I guess, to see if my opinion changes.

799
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:53,100
Well, your opinion won't change.

800
01:03:53,100 --> 01:03:57,100
Yeah. Maybe In The Groove 2 is this godly game.

801
01:03:57,100 --> 01:04:00,100
Yeah, there you go. Now maybe In The Groove 2 is a little better. You'll see. We'll see.

802
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:01,100
All right.

803
01:04:01,100 --> 01:04:02,100
I don't think so.

804
01:04:02,100 --> 01:04:09,100
That's like saying maybe McDonald's, you know, brand new stuff is going to taste good. Maybe it's going to be real meat this time. No.

805
01:04:09,100 --> 01:04:15,100
All right. Well, chat room, if you want to respond to that, we will open up the Skype line a little later.

806
01:04:15,100 --> 01:04:19,220
later. If you want to... There's not going to be anything you're going to say that's

807
01:04:19,220 --> 01:04:22,940
going to change Loki's mind. I do have something though that we got to try. I meant to get

808
01:04:22,940 --> 01:04:29,860
here earlier today. Okay. I have acquired a copy of SingStar. What the hell's that?

809
01:04:29,860 --> 01:04:36,060
The European karaoke game. Oh. Oh! Oh, gosh. You brought this up like months ago on the

810
01:04:36,060 --> 01:04:40,300
show. Okay, I remember SingStar. Yeah, their karaoke game that's, you know... Was that

811
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:47,180
the one in E3? It might have been. It's a karaoke game that, you know, it's not Konami

812
01:04:47,180 --> 01:04:53,340
made. Hold on. Dark Soccer, do you remember this E3 booth, the UK games? You probably

813
01:04:53,340 --> 01:04:57,700
spent a little time there, right? A little bit? Uh, sort of. They had a karaoke game.

814
01:04:57,700 --> 01:05:03,800
Sing Star? Is that the name of it? Yeah, what was it? Pop Star. Yeah, Sing Star Pop. So

815
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:07,340
maybe they altered the name a little bit. Okay, so you got a chance to check this out?

816
01:05:07,340 --> 01:05:09,500
well i haven't got a play yet

817
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:12,500
uh... but i've meant to bring it over today

818
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:14,300
so i want to get out next week

819
01:05:14,300 --> 01:05:16,800
did you just like you're every type of attention for bs

820
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:20,540
night i was wrapped or literally i'd like to require my option to be late

821
01:05:20,540 --> 01:05:23,180
alright alright

822
01:05:23,180 --> 01:05:26,940
speaking of technical taxes and i actually have to play a new game uh...

823
01:05:26,940 --> 01:05:30,420
a music game myself this past week it was actually came that they have on a

824
01:05:30,420 --> 01:05:31,140
different

825
01:05:31,140 --> 01:05:32,820
eight at eight on the break

826
01:05:32,820 --> 01:05:36,460
and actually something that the creators of the air to stick that is the

827
01:05:36,460 --> 01:05:39,580
distributors of the game actually emailed us about a while back and we've

828
01:05:39,580 --> 01:05:41,900
kind of refrained from talking about it because there has been a lot of

829
01:05:41,900 --> 01:05:45,940
information on it but I actually got a chance to play this game and imagine if

830
01:05:45,940 --> 01:05:52,140
Taiko no Tatujin and Drummania had a baby it would be this game called

831
01:05:52,140 --> 01:05:57,100
Percussion Master which is what I got a chance to play over at 8 on the break I

832
01:05:57,100 --> 01:06:00,940
actually kind of enjoyed Percussion Master when I first was kind of looking

833
01:06:00,940 --> 01:06:04,380
at the the release that the guy had sent us and stuff and the fact that there

834
01:06:04,380 --> 01:06:08,460
wasn't a whole lot of information. I was kind of thinking, eh, I don't know about this game.

835
01:06:08,460 --> 01:06:12,380
It kind of looks like it's going to be a little cheesy bit of a rip-off. But what makes this

836
01:06:12,380 --> 01:06:15,540
game good is that they actually have a pretty solid song list. Now, granted, they have a

837
01:06:15,540 --> 01:06:19,020
lot of covers in it, but that's okay, because Karaoke Revolution has covers, too, and they

838
01:06:19,020 --> 01:06:20,460
work out really well.

839
01:06:20,460 --> 01:06:26,060
Progression Master has covers of songs like Goonies Are Good Enough, Mickey, I think there

840
01:06:26,060 --> 01:06:29,060
was a Britney Spears song I had to play in there, too, and then just some other, like,

841
01:06:29,060 --> 01:06:32,420
classics as well. I don't remember the whole list. I'm sure there's a song list out there

842
01:06:32,420 --> 01:06:37,460
the internet somewhere. But I had a pretty solid song list. I was pretty impressed.

843
01:06:37,460 --> 01:06:42,500
And it was pretty fun to play. The drums were pretty solid. You basically have a giant drum

844
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:49,140
in the middle and then two on the side. So it's kind of like an O and then one right

845
01:06:49,140 --> 01:06:52,220
above the upper left and upper right, like cymbals or something you could call it, although

846
01:06:52,220 --> 01:06:57,720
they don't look like it. They look like loaves of bread that you're hitting. So you're beating

847
01:06:57,720 --> 01:07:01,540
on a pie and two loaves of bread. That's the progression. But it feels a lot like taiko

848
01:07:01,540 --> 01:07:05,500
for some reason when you play, because it's like, instead of hitting the side of the drum,

849
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:08,620
you're hitting these little things on the top, where normally it would be a very similar

850
01:07:08,620 --> 01:07:10,920
striking motion as I would hit the side of the drum.

851
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:14,720
So that's why I think I kind of call it very similar to Taiko, but the interface is very

852
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:17,760
much like Drummania, where the notes scroll from the top.

853
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:19,560
And it was pretty cool.

854
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:25,060
The only, I guess, negative thing I would be able to say about Percussion Master is

855
01:07:25,060 --> 01:07:31,080
that it doesn't seem like there's a whole lot you can do with the game.

856
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:34,280
And granted, maybe you could say the same thing about Drummania, but it kind of seems

857
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:37,920
like, I don't know, with these three drums, and maybe I didn't play songs that were hard

858
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:42,120
enough, but it kind of seemed like, I think this game might get boring after a while.

859
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:46,080
I didn't see anything in it that would really make me want to play it like an awful lot,

860
01:07:46,080 --> 01:07:49,960
like where I could get like into this game and have like the total replay value.

861
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:54,480
But as far as like a nice little side distraction to have in your arcade next to other music

862
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:55,480
games, I think it's a great addition.

863
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:56,920
I think people should check it out at least once.

864
01:07:56,920 --> 01:08:01,920
I guess it's probably easier to play than MTV's Drumscape.

865
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:03,920
There are no directions.

866
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:07,920
That game is just crazy. You sort of have to guess as you go along.

867
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:10,920
They have one in Santa Cruz on the boardwalk.

868
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:11,920
Yeah, it's like, huh?

869
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:14,920
I think it's distributed by the same people that do the Drumscape game.

870
01:08:14,920 --> 01:08:17,920
Because I remember on their site I thought I saw something about Drumscape.

871
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:19,920
But this is not... I didn't see any ties to MTV.

872
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:23,920
You know what was really kind of funky about this game is that on their high score list

873
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:25,920
it actually had pictures of the high score people.

874
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:28,940
game actually has a little teeny camera in it that takes your picture, like an itoy type

875
01:08:28,940 --> 01:08:32,680
thing that takes your picture when you get a high score. Now, I didn't get any high scores.

876
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:38,840
Go figure, I freaking triple-a'd two of my songs the first time I ever played them. They're

877
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:42,000
not really triple-a's, but whatever you want to call them. I got all perfects the first

878
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:45,520
time I played these songs, and I didn't get my picture on the high score board. I guess

879
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:50,300
my scores weren't good enough somehow, even though I got all perfects. Oh well. Somebody

880
01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:53,180
beat me to it i don't know

881
01:08:53,180 --> 01:08:54,260
uh...

882
01:08:54,260 --> 01:08:58,420
yeah the answer the question chat is a cmt be like if i didn't see an mtv logo

883
01:08:58,420 --> 01:09:02,180
on this game anywhere and i don't think it's empty and there was nothing

884
01:09:02,180 --> 01:09:04,700
like carson daley wasn't in it

885
01:09:04,700 --> 01:09:07,700
i don't think there was anything to do with the dailies

886
01:09:07,700 --> 01:09:10,580
but he's not going to be anymore really i don't think so

887
01:09:10,580 --> 01:09:13,780
i think he's gone i think it works for nbc now that's right

888
01:09:13,780 --> 01:09:16,620
he did he has a show on nbc why we talk about that anyway

889
01:09:16,620 --> 01:09:21,100
uh... that's way too much time for him already no

890
01:09:21,100 --> 01:09:24,820
so i i got to play the game i'd like to i'd just don't think i could play it

891
01:09:24,820 --> 01:09:27,760
every day but it's a nice is like it's something that i think what i i'd have

892
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:31,360
fun playing in between games of the year

893
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:35,080
now taken a debt to them for uh... the psp

894
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:36,580
all

895
01:09:36,580 --> 01:09:40,180
it's awesome it's it's great and you're what i'd be like

896
01:09:40,180 --> 01:09:43,140
looking at the end like how the hell is gonna work because

897
01:09:43,140 --> 01:09:45,940
I mean, you can't obviously beat the PlayStation with...

898
01:09:45,940 --> 01:09:48,740
I was gonna say, how can...

899
01:09:48,740 --> 01:09:53,440
When I think of Tycho Nutatigen on PSP, I think about Beatmania on the Game Boy,

900
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:57,140
or on the Wonderswan even, and I kinda like...

901
01:09:57,140 --> 01:10:00,540
Beatmania on the Wonderswan was great! It was digitized!

902
01:10:00,540 --> 01:10:02,340
Yeah, it was, but...

903
01:10:02,340 --> 01:10:06,840
I mean, playing with the buttons and the control pad... nah, the play was missing.

904
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:11,740
It works very simple. Basically, on the Tycho Drum, your main

905
01:10:11,740 --> 01:10:17,380
stuff is going to be either the directional pad or the buttons. So, you know, the left

906
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:21,580
drum would be the directional pad and the right drum would be the four buttons. And

907
01:10:21,580 --> 01:10:26,300
then to hit the sides are the L button and the R button. And so that's how the game's

908
01:10:26,300 --> 01:10:31,380
played. And it's really simple, easy to figure out. The mini games are fucking hilarious.

909
01:10:31,380 --> 01:10:37,340
They're great. And they get really hard. So, and it's a lot of fun. Really, I'd highly

910
01:10:37,340 --> 01:10:42,480
recommend the game when it comes out here. It's right now only in Japan, but it looks

911
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:46,340
really good. It's a good start for music games, though, on the PSP, because it's done very,

912
01:10:46,340 --> 01:10:52,740
very well. Can't wait to play it. It has Toxic on it, which I thought was weird. Toxic, and

913
01:10:52,740 --> 01:10:54,340
there was a couple other songs that were really strange.

914
01:10:54,340 --> 01:10:56,540
Is this the Japanese version of Taiko, or is this American?

915
01:10:56,540 --> 01:10:57,540
Yeah, this is Japanese.

916
01:10:57,540 --> 01:10:59,740
And they had Toxic? I don't remember that being on any of them.

917
01:10:59,740 --> 01:11:05,220
They had Toxic on there. They have We Will Rock You. They also have, of course, you know,

918
01:11:05,220 --> 01:11:13,220
and some other weird songs on there, Ridge Racer and stuff, and it was fun, they have all the sounds you can unlock.

919
01:11:13,220 --> 01:11:19,220
It sounds very similar to the US release Taiko Drum Master, but on the PSP in Japanese.

920
01:11:19,220 --> 01:11:24,220
Like the songs you're saying, I'm thinking, yeah, that wasn't Taiko Drum Master.

921
01:11:24,220 --> 01:11:27,220
I couldn't tell you, but it's fun. I like it.

922
01:11:27,220 --> 01:11:29,220
Interesting.

923
01:11:29,220 --> 01:11:32,220
Wow, we've played a whole lot of new music-based games these past couple of weeks.

924
01:11:32,220 --> 01:11:36,220
I've been playing Burnout 3. That's not really a music-based game, but it's fun.

925
01:11:36,220 --> 01:11:41,220
Well, I'll talk about some. I've been playing Illuminus, which is kind of like half a music game.

926
01:11:41,220 --> 01:11:46,220
I have all three copies of my, um, Puppies on order.

927
01:11:46,220 --> 01:11:51,220
Ooh. Ooh, I didn't know that Technic Beat was coming out on PSP.

928
01:11:51,220 --> 01:11:56,220
Ooh, I have all three copies of my, um, Puppies on order.

929
01:11:56,220 --> 01:12:01,220
Ooh, I didn't know that Technic Beat was coming out on PSP.

930
01:12:01,220 --> 01:12:11,220
That's awesome. What was Technic Beat again? Technic Beat was that one with the little dude that walked around it with all the circles and you'd have to walk to the circle and hit the button.

931
01:12:11,220 --> 01:12:23,220
Yeah, and as a reminder also that DJ Max is coming out on the PSP. That one's going to be weird though. That's going to be playing just like, I think, Beatmania on the PSP. It's going to be a little weird.

932
01:12:23,220 --> 01:12:26,220
Interesting. But cool. I'm still very excited about it.

933
01:12:26,220 --> 01:12:30,780
that. Alrighty, I think what we're going to do now is we're going to go ahead and take

934
01:12:30,780 --> 01:12:39,300
a break, and when we come back from this break, we're going to do a little bit of Skype and

935
01:12:39,300 --> 01:12:45,220
hear what the callers have to say. So, we'll do that. First off though, I want to see if

936
01:12:45,220 --> 01:12:52,540
I can find this. I wanted to play some songs from the new, if I could find it, maybe I

937
01:12:52,540 --> 01:13:00,540
I don't have it. I don't want to say what it was if I don't really have it. Never mind, I'll have to look for that for later.

938
01:13:00,540 --> 01:13:06,540
And also, we'd like to thank our listeners who voted for us for the podcast awards. Absolutely.

939
01:13:06,540 --> 01:13:11,540
Thank you. Best meetings on the podcast, that's right. Kisses. Looking at us. Thank you.

940
01:13:11,540 --> 01:13:16,540
And also, did you know that this week we're featured on the iTunes store? I saw that we're on page two. Isn't that crazy? Yeah.

941
01:13:16,540 --> 01:13:21,540
I don't know how that happened, but we're there. That's pretty awesome. I'm not going to complain. Hell no.

942
01:13:21,540 --> 01:13:27,540
Oh, and I have to apologize for last week, or not really last week.

943
01:13:27,540 --> 01:13:29,540
All we had was a headset microphone, first of all.

944
01:13:29,540 --> 01:13:35,540
But the week before last, with Katamari radio that we were pretty much doing.

945
01:13:35,540 --> 01:13:39,540
Because we had We Love Katamari at Dark Sakura's house.

946
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:42,540
Oh, I was going to play music from We Heart Katamari.

947
01:13:42,540 --> 01:13:45,540
You'll see inch widescreen katamari.

948
01:13:45,540 --> 01:13:48,540
That game is so much fun. I love it.

949
01:13:48,540 --> 01:13:52,540
The Namco X Capcom intro looked very cool on my TV.

950
01:13:52,540 --> 01:13:57,540
Yeah, I'm going to probably delete that game just because I don't know how to play it and it's all in Japanese.

951
01:13:57,540 --> 01:14:01,540
I actually don't delete it yet because I want it.

952
01:14:01,540 --> 01:14:07,540
You need to show me where to get that thing you have.

953
01:14:07,540 --> 01:14:10,540
Alright, we're going to go to break and we're going to come back and have the Skype line.

954
01:14:10,540 --> 01:14:16,780
be back after this. Also, DDR with fire when we come back. We'll do some Bahmani potpourri

955
01:14:16,780 --> 01:14:21,140
in this break. We'll start off with a little bit of Taku. Maybe this will perk Dark Soccer

956
01:14:21,140 --> 01:14:28,140
up a little bit of Taku. Yay! Alright, here we go. We'll be back after this.

957
01:15:21,140 --> 01:15:23,140
Oh

958
01:16:21,140 --> 01:16:31,140
Can you keep me like a nasty girl, you want a nasty love?

959
01:16:31,140 --> 01:16:38,140
I know that you want me honey, I'm feeding some more people, better stay healthy for love

960
01:16:38,140 --> 01:16:45,140
You know that I want baby love, just to feel my heart

961
01:16:45,140 --> 01:16:49,140
Talking about you has to be my meaning

962
01:16:50,140 --> 01:16:53,140
I'm just asking for the real love

963
01:16:53,140 --> 01:16:55,140
It's gonna make me feel

964
01:16:55,140 --> 01:16:59,140
To take me higher

965
01:17:00,140 --> 01:17:02,140
Hey, I'm not having enough

966
01:17:02,140 --> 01:17:06,140
To try to make sure that you're still

967
01:17:07,140 --> 01:17:10,140
Hey, I'm sorry but you've got to try to

968
01:17:10,140 --> 01:17:12,140
You've gotta be still

969
01:17:12,140 --> 01:17:16,140
Seein' we're together ever more

970
01:17:16,140 --> 01:17:19,140
Shine on me forever

971
01:17:19,140 --> 01:17:21,140
Shine on me

972
01:17:21,140 --> 01:17:24,140
Shine on me forever

973
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:29,380
Shining on the lightning Sheen

974
01:17:54,140 --> 01:18:00,140
Yes I, I have a dream of you

975
01:18:00,140 --> 01:18:03,140
I'm getting out of my own way

976
01:18:03,140 --> 01:18:06,140
But I belong to you

977
01:18:06,140 --> 01:18:25,660
Rainy days on my hands without you, Rainy days on my feet around you,

978
01:18:25,660 --> 01:18:31,020
I feel better when I remember yesterday, yeah.

979
01:18:31,020 --> 01:18:38,020
Memories in my heart are not the same Memories in my mind seem to be real

980
01:18:38,020 --> 01:18:43,020
What I wanted to tell about my yesterday

981
01:18:43,020 --> 01:18:49,020
In the night I was away for sure But I had no fear to break my heart

982
01:18:49,020 --> 01:18:56,020
In the light the sun is on my side When I had the right thing

983
01:18:56,020 --> 01:19:00,160
Screaming again today

984
01:19:00,160 --> 01:19:02,460
I had a dream of you

985
01:19:02,460 --> 01:19:06,240
I gave your love away

986
01:19:06,240 --> 01:19:08,340
But I belong to you

987
01:19:08,340 --> 01:19:12,200
Screaming again today

988
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:14,580
I had a dream of you

989
01:19:14,580 --> 01:19:18,220
I gave your love away

990
01:19:18,220 --> 01:19:23,220
That I belong to you

991
01:19:23,220 --> 01:19:28,220
Green Bay

992
01:19:28,220 --> 01:19:33,220
Green Bay

993
01:19:33,220 --> 01:19:38,220
Green Bay

994
01:19:38,220 --> 01:19:43,220
Green Bay

995
01:20:43,220 --> 01:20:59,220
Solid Snake, Solid Snake, Solid Snake, Can you hear what I'm saying?

996
01:20:59,220 --> 01:21:02,220
Roll this down, let's take a man, better watch your back

997
01:21:02,220 --> 01:21:05,220
I'm gonna kick your asses, beat them, kill them all

998
01:21:05,220 --> 01:21:12,220
Tom, Tom what am I gonna do? Tom, Tom what am I gonna do? Tom, what am I gonna do? Tom, Tom.

999
01:21:15,220 --> 01:21:17,220
Have you ever seen a cool game like this?

1000
01:21:18,220 --> 01:21:19,220
They don't care.

1001
01:21:24,220 --> 01:21:26,220
Gaming Radio, so uncensored

1002
01:21:28,220 --> 01:21:30,220
that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.

1003
01:21:30,220 --> 01:21:32,220
Uh, Mooch, uh, Moo-Kaw-Kee?

1004
01:21:32,220 --> 01:21:34,220
Orange Lounge Radio.

1005
01:22:04,220 --> 01:22:10,100
Tap Break, Taku with Electro-Tuned, not only 2DX 3rd style I think it was originally in,

1006
01:22:10,100 --> 01:22:20,100
DDR 5th Mix as well, Risky Men featuring Suka with Mr. T, Take Me Higher, Asuga, 2DX 4th

1007
01:22:20,100 --> 01:22:24,540
style as well as...wasn't anyone into DDR's 5th Mix, DDR, I think?

1008
01:22:24,540 --> 01:22:26,580
I think it was one of those unlocks, remember how...

1009
01:22:26,580 --> 01:22:27,580
It was in 5th Mix.

1010
01:22:27,580 --> 01:22:29,340
Yeah, remember how 5th Mix had all those unlocks in it?

1011
01:22:29,340 --> 01:22:31,460
I think Electro-Tuned was also one of those songs.

1012
01:22:31,460 --> 01:22:33,540
Yeah, Electro-Tuned was in 5th Mix.

1013
01:22:33,540 --> 01:22:37,680
Cherry with Yesterday. Boy, we played a lot of songs that crossed over in other

1014
01:22:37,680 --> 01:22:41,920
Bamani games that break without even realizing it. Cherry Yesterday was, was that actually

1015
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:46,420
in Para Para? It was in Para Para. Yes, it was. Was it? It was in a second. You had,

1016
01:22:46,420 --> 01:22:50,140
it started off with the right arm sweep, left arm sweep, both arms. That scares me that

1017
01:22:50,140 --> 01:22:54,540
you remember that. Yeah, that's like all I remember of it too. In 2DX6 style, of course.

1018
01:22:54,540 --> 01:22:59,260
There was a Para song in 6 style that wasn't actually in Para Para Paradise. I think it,

1019
01:22:59,260 --> 01:23:02,180
I think it's the song, Para Para Paradise. That's it. That's why I'm getting confused.

1020
01:23:02,180 --> 01:23:03,460
You remember that song in 6.01?

1021
01:23:03,460 --> 01:23:04,820
Pah-dah-pah-dah-pah-dah-dah-dice.

1022
01:23:04,820 --> 01:23:05,940
That song wasn't in.

1023
01:23:05,940 --> 01:23:07,300
That song was a pain in the ass.

1024
01:23:07,300 --> 01:23:07,780
Yeah.

1025
01:23:07,780 --> 01:23:11,780
Anyway, um, also, um, a Konami original there, the Metal Gear Solid, um,

1026
01:23:12,740 --> 01:23:17,300
mix from Beatmania, like, hell, that wasn't the very first Beatmania, wasn't it?

1027
01:23:18,100 --> 01:23:20,580
It might have been Beatmania 3rd Mix when that came in.

1028
01:23:20,580 --> 01:23:22,180
Uh, the Metal Gear one?

1029
01:23:22,180 --> 01:23:22,660
Yeah.

1030
01:23:22,660 --> 01:23:23,780
Uh, yeah.

1031
01:23:23,780 --> 01:23:25,700
Wasn't it dated, like, all the way back to the very first Beatmania?

1032
01:23:25,700 --> 01:23:25,860
No.

1033
01:23:26,500 --> 01:23:26,980
No, no.

1034
01:23:26,980 --> 01:23:29,700
It was, it was 3rd Mix, I believe.

1035
01:23:29,700 --> 01:23:30,180
You know why?

1036
01:23:30,180 --> 01:23:30,900
Because Beatmania-

1037
01:23:30,900 --> 01:23:35,400
It definitely was Third Mix, because that's when, um, that was when I first played. It was on a Third Mix machine.

1038
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:39,400
First Mix, Second Append, and, like, Third Mix all looked the same.

1039
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:45,400
Well, First and Second were, um, were released as one, with the Append.

1040
01:23:45,400 --> 01:23:46,400
Oh, that's right, that's right.

1041
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:47,400
The Ebisu.

1042
01:23:47,400 --> 01:23:47,900
Mm-hmm.

1043
01:23:47,900 --> 01:23:51,400
And then there was Third, Fourth, because, uh...

1044
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:53,400
And they were all Appends, weren't they?

1045
01:23:53,400 --> 01:23:54,400
Yes, Fifth.

1046
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:56,400
Until they got to Sixth.

1047
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:58,900
Right, Sixth is the one I don't have. I have Club Mix.

1048
01:23:58,900 --> 01:23:59,900
Mm-hmm.

1049
01:23:59,900 --> 01:24:02,900
I have, um, Club 2, I think.

1050
01:24:02,900 --> 01:24:03,900
Can you imagine if they did that-

1051
01:24:03,900 --> 01:24:04,900
I have GoToMix.

1052
01:24:04,900 --> 01:24:07,900
Can you imagine if they did that append thing here in the US?

1053
01:24:07,900 --> 01:24:13,900
Like, in order to play, uh, DDR Extreme, you have to have, uh, DDR USA, the old school one.

1054
01:24:13,900 --> 01:24:16,900
I can't believe that the pub- that the general public response would be,

1055
01:24:16,900 --> 01:24:17,900
BITCH, WHAT?

1056
01:24:17,900 --> 01:24:19,900
Exactly. Exactly.

1057
01:24:19,900 --> 01:24:21,900
Nintendo can get away with that shit.

1058
01:24:21,900 --> 01:24:23,900
Yeah, we're gonna release three different versions of Nintendo,

1059
01:24:23,900 --> 01:24:24,900
cause you're gonna buy them all.

1060
01:24:24,900 --> 01:24:25,900
Um, but yet-

1061
01:24:25,900 --> 01:24:27,900
Okay, Nintendo, we love you, bye bye.

1062
01:24:27,900 --> 01:24:28,900
Exactly.

1063
01:24:28,900 --> 01:24:31,900
Okay Nintendo, just put out another Zelda game and we'll be fine.

1064
01:24:34,900 --> 01:24:35,900
Anyway.

1065
01:24:35,900 --> 01:24:37,900
That's how they get you started.

1066
01:24:37,900 --> 01:24:38,900
I got told.

1067
01:24:38,900 --> 01:24:41,900
Electro-Tuned was actually in second style.

1068
01:24:41,900 --> 01:24:43,900
So I forgot. I forgot.

1069
01:24:43,900 --> 01:24:47,900
You know why? Because I'm used to playing it in third style PS2.

1070
01:24:47,900 --> 01:24:48,900
Give me a break.

1071
01:24:49,900 --> 01:24:50,900
No, that's all cool.

1072
01:24:53,900 --> 01:24:54,900
Let's see.

1073
01:24:54,900 --> 01:24:56,900
Oh, also I wanted to say about the Metal Gear Solid theme.

1074
01:24:56,900 --> 01:25:01,580
going to be in the upcoming Beatmania USA, at least if the E3 demo is in the

1075
01:25:01,580 --> 01:25:04,260
indication. That's a game we really haven't heard anything about for quite

1076
01:25:04,260 --> 01:25:07,260
some time, but it kind of makes sense because, you know, we got two DDR's

1077
01:25:07,260 --> 01:25:11,220
looming. I'm assuming that Konami staff is kind of busy with those games and

1078
01:25:11,220 --> 01:25:16,300
they'll worry about Beatmania when those two are out. I think there was a date

1079
01:25:16,300 --> 01:25:21,300
change or something about it. It's still in spring. I think Miklotov is back on the

1080
01:25:21,300 --> 01:25:25,020
show next week. I do think he's planning a trip up here next week, so although

1081
01:25:25,020 --> 01:25:31,020
Although he's been very tight on his NDA this year and hasn't been able to give us much juicy gossip on the show,

1082
01:25:31,020 --> 01:25:34,020
hopefully we'll be able to get something out of him next week. At least something.

1083
01:25:34,020 --> 01:25:40,020
And also the heads of a bunch of game companies are coming to my work at the end of August.

1084
01:25:40,020 --> 01:25:43,020
So I'm going to get the smooths with the head of Konami.

1085
01:25:43,020 --> 01:25:45,020
Take those orange on the radio press kits.

1086
01:25:45,020 --> 01:25:47,020
I will be taking the press kits.

1087
01:25:47,020 --> 01:25:49,020
Hopefully we didn't bash too many of their products.

1088
01:25:49,020 --> 01:25:53,980
ahead, we're going to have the head of, what was it, they're going to be, I think, Microsoft

1089
01:25:53,980 --> 01:26:01,580
is coming, Ubisoft, Konami, well, there's about 25 invites at least that they're going

1090
01:26:01,580 --> 01:26:02,580
out to.

1091
01:26:02,580 --> 01:26:07,220
Now, tell that Konami dude that they need to release a freaking press release on Extreme

1092
01:26:07,220 --> 01:26:11,900
2 already. No, I know you're not really going to do that. You know there was a hint dropped

1093
01:26:11,900 --> 01:26:16,500
on the DER forums this week, though. Dancer X, which is one of those guys that we all

1094
01:26:16,500 --> 01:26:20,140
I know it has something to do with Konami, but doesn't really advertise it.

1095
01:26:20,140 --> 01:26:25,500
He came and it said, expect a small wave of information in the near future.

1096
01:26:25,500 --> 01:26:29,780
Well, we already found about, was it, there was more Ultramix 3 info.

1097
01:26:29,780 --> 01:26:31,380
Yes, there was more Ultramix 3 info.

1098
01:26:31,380 --> 01:26:33,060
I'm glad you brought that up.

1099
01:26:33,060 --> 01:26:36,660
That was also a DDR Freak forum thing.

1100
01:26:36,660 --> 01:26:39,380
One of the users on there, who I know I've seen their name before,

1101
01:26:39,380 --> 01:26:40,380
is a show listener.

1102
01:26:40,380 --> 01:26:42,420
So hello, guy, if you're listening.

1103
01:26:42,420 --> 01:26:46,420
That was actually Same, who sent the email to Zonk's official website

1104
01:26:46,420 --> 01:26:51,540
asking if they have songs in DDR Ultramix 3 and to come back, yes, DDR Ultramix 3 will

1105
01:26:51,540 --> 01:26:57,260
feature a song by Zonk and a remix by Zonk.

1106
01:26:57,260 --> 01:27:02,420
I forgot, what was I going to say, I looked back, I had to dive back in the archives in

1107
01:27:02,420 --> 01:27:06,520
my live journal back in the day, remember when I found there was a whole unprotected

1108
01:27:06,520 --> 01:27:11,020
section of Zonk's website that had a bunch of info about, that had a bunch of like graphics

1109
01:27:11,020 --> 01:27:13,780
and stuff that were used in the song.

1110
01:27:13,780 --> 01:27:20,260
they don't have that anymore. Apparently, ddrfreak managed to dig up this post that

1111
01:27:20,260 --> 01:27:27,900
said, the forbidden dance dance Basile from the Orifice release will be in UltraMix 3.

1112
01:27:27,900 --> 01:27:36,380
It's a weird song. Orifice was the folks that did Art of Hot, also. Orifice is just one

1113
01:27:36,380 --> 01:27:40,100
of the guys from Zonk, also, if you didn't know that. Orifice and Zonk are kind of related.

1114
01:27:40,100 --> 01:27:46,100
Orifice is just one of the guys from Zonk. And I think their song, Art of Hot, I think was the name of it? Or was that another group?

1115
01:27:46,100 --> 01:27:54,100
I can't remember. It's one of those songs, I have to admit, I love the Zonk song in UltraMix too, but I don't really play the Orifice song very much, sorry to say.

1116
01:27:54,100 --> 01:27:56,100
I wasn't a big fan of that.

1117
01:27:56,100 --> 01:27:57,100
Yeah.

1118
01:27:57,100 --> 01:28:03,100
So we know that the, so it's very interesting how many folks are coming back.

1119
01:28:03,100 --> 01:28:08,100
Oh I screwed up. The name of the song is I Spy. I found a clip of it. Here it is. Art of Hot was another band.

1120
01:28:08,100 --> 01:28:10,100
That's the orifice one.

1121
01:28:13,100 --> 01:28:16,100
And you can kind of see the similarities there to Zonk.

1122
01:28:21,100 --> 01:28:25,100
Rene posted us a link in the chatroom on Konami's official website.

1123
01:28:25,100 --> 01:28:28,100
They're still saying Spring 2006 for BeatMania.

1124
01:28:28,100 --> 01:28:30,100
There's an official little link there.

1125
01:28:30,100 --> 01:28:32,100
Yeah, I think it's still Spring.

1126
01:28:32,100 --> 01:28:34,100
I'll ask them. I'll bug them.

1127
01:28:34,100 --> 01:28:39,100
Because what's great about, you know, it's just, I don't know, I know the most about games.

1128
01:28:39,100 --> 01:28:42,100
It's just what it comes down to.

1129
01:28:42,100 --> 01:28:48,100
Just find out already if Cartoon Heroes is going to be in Xtreme 2 or not so we can shut these people on DDR Freak up.

1130
01:28:48,100 --> 01:28:49,100
Okay.

1131
01:28:49,100 --> 01:28:50,100
Alright.

1132
01:28:50,100 --> 01:28:54,100
Anyway, um, I guess we should open up the Skype line.

1133
01:28:54,100 --> 01:28:56,100
See if we can get some calls.

1134
01:28:56,100 --> 01:28:58,100
We've had people asking.

1135
01:28:58,100 --> 01:28:59,100
Alright.

1136
01:28:59,100 --> 01:29:01,100
Well, I'm firing up Skype right now.

1137
01:29:01,100 --> 01:29:02,100
Logging in.

1138
01:29:02,100 --> 01:29:03,100
Beep, beep, beep. Here we go.

1139
01:29:03,100 --> 01:29:06,340
I should see if there's been any upgrades to Skype recently.

1140
01:29:06,340 --> 01:29:09,740
You know you should check Skype's website often because they do fix their program quite

1141
01:29:09,740 --> 01:29:10,740
often.

1142
01:29:10,740 --> 01:29:11,740
They always release new ones.

1143
01:29:11,740 --> 01:29:15,540
So, did you know, by the way, we have like 61 people on our list on Skype.

1144
01:29:15,540 --> 01:29:16,780
I think that's kind of cool.

1145
01:29:16,780 --> 01:29:19,980
Okay, so I just logged on to Skype and there's only like five people in.

1146
01:29:19,980 --> 01:29:21,620
What's up with that?

1147
01:29:21,620 --> 01:29:23,260
Well, we're up and running.

1148
01:29:23,260 --> 01:29:26,540
We're ready for you guys to start calling in if you want to call us.

1149
01:29:26,540 --> 01:29:33,420
Remember, if you want more information on how to call the program, www.orangeloungeradio.com

1150
01:29:33,420 --> 01:29:35,700
click on interact with us.

1151
01:29:35,700 --> 01:29:38,220
And it has more information about the Skype line.

1152
01:29:38,220 --> 01:29:40,020
And I just dropped my mouse, which is really smooth.

1153
01:29:40,020 --> 01:29:41,020
Yes, DarkSakura.

1154
01:29:41,020 --> 01:29:43,140
That's what I think I'm about.

1155
01:29:43,140 --> 01:29:45,340
Oh, me dropping my mouse, yeah.

1156
01:29:45,340 --> 01:29:46,900
Oh, look, we got a call.

1157
01:29:46,900 --> 01:29:47,900
Let's take it.

1158
01:29:47,900 --> 01:29:49,700
Oh, this is a guy that used to call us like all the freaking time.

1159
01:29:49,700 --> 01:29:51,340
We haven't talked to him in a while.

1160
01:29:51,340 --> 01:29:52,340
Let's do this.

1161
01:29:52,340 --> 01:29:55,180
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1162
01:29:55,180 --> 01:29:56,180
Legend of Zaku here.

1163
01:29:56,180 --> 01:29:59,180
Hello, Legend of Zaku. Long time no chat.

1164
01:29:59,180 --> 01:30:02,180
I know. I finally got broadband, so now I can do this.

1165
01:30:02,180 --> 01:30:05,180
And I'm in the middle of a storm, so I'm going to try to make this real quick.

1166
01:30:05,180 --> 01:30:08,180
Alright. Congratulations on the broadband upgrade.

1167
01:30:08,180 --> 01:30:13,180
Yeah, man. Anyways, I could vouch for you for the whole In The Groove 2 thing.

1168
01:30:13,180 --> 01:30:14,180
How so?

1169
01:30:14,180 --> 01:30:19,180
Because I've been already playing this game since, what, July?

1170
01:30:19,180 --> 01:30:21,180
Last month?

1171
01:30:21,180 --> 01:30:25,080
That's all I've been doing, playing in the groove in Coney Island and Chinatown.

1172
01:30:25,080 --> 01:30:28,620
So I can pretty much say it's a big improvement from the first one.

1173
01:30:28,620 --> 01:30:29,620
Really?

1174
01:30:29,620 --> 01:30:32,060
I don't know if that's really vouching for me, but okay.

1175
01:30:32,060 --> 01:30:35,380
Item by item, can you name how it's better?

1176
01:30:35,380 --> 01:30:36,380
Let me see.

1177
01:30:36,380 --> 01:30:41,060
Freeze rules, the fact that, you know, it's just a, you know, with the new cabinet and

1178
01:30:41,060 --> 01:30:44,820
the fact that the pads aren't as, you know, aren't as just crappy as, you know, as if

1179
01:30:44,820 --> 01:30:47,260
you were actually putting it in a DDR machine.

1180
01:30:47,260 --> 01:30:50,600
Let me state this too, maybe I should have gotten this out because, and this is one thing

1181
01:30:50,600 --> 01:30:54,400
where I may have said that in the group two looks exactly like in the group one because

1182
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:58,840
the machine it ain't on the break is an upgraded old cabinet, you know, like a DDR cabinet

1183
01:30:58,840 --> 01:30:59,840
from back in the day.

1184
01:30:59,840 --> 01:31:00,840
Exactly.

1185
01:31:00,840 --> 01:31:01,840
So...

1186
01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:02,840
Most of the new machines...

1187
01:31:02,840 --> 01:31:04,440
To in the group's credit, that might be part of the reason why I'm feeling that way.

1188
01:31:04,440 --> 01:31:06,120
I didn't see a new build.

1189
01:31:06,120 --> 01:31:10,880
Most of the in the group two machines are brand new in the city.

1190
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:11,880
Well I missed them.

1191
01:31:11,880 --> 01:31:12,880
So...

1192
01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:14,160
Zaku, you should have called me while I was out there.

1193
01:31:14,160 --> 01:31:19,680
Hey, I didn't have broadband, I was getting my broadband set up last week, so eh, to that.

1194
01:31:19,680 --> 01:31:22,560
I may be coming back. I may be coming back very soon.

1195
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:27,560
Are you sure about it? You know digital life expo is happening in October.

1196
01:31:27,560 --> 01:31:32,360
I know, I know, but I don't know if I can swing the time off work.

1197
01:31:32,360 --> 01:31:34,680
I mean, it's worth it. I mean, you know, think about it.

1198
01:31:34,680 --> 01:31:38,520
What would persuade you to actually go there and bring the rest of the people so that way

1199
01:31:38,520 --> 01:31:39,720
you could broadcast it live?

1200
01:31:39,720 --> 01:31:42,400
It's not about persuading me. It's about persuading my boss, and I'm sure

1201
01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:44,800
Loki and Dark Sakura feel similar.

1202
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:47,720
Especially that Dark Sakura will be a newlywed at the time.

1203
01:31:47,720 --> 01:31:54,720
Oh, it's the simple fact that I'm having to beg for two days of work, and I'm only going to have three remaining for the rest of the year after I get married.

1204
01:31:54,720 --> 01:31:59,720
Me, personally, I would love to come out there if I can get the time off, which I don't know if it's very likely.

1205
01:31:59,720 --> 01:32:05,720
I did see the advertisement about the tournament. It's tempting. I think I'd know more people in an NYC tournament.

1206
01:32:05,720 --> 01:32:09,720
Hopefully I should be competing there this year again, like I did last.

1207
01:32:09,720 --> 01:32:13,720
Let me put it this way, Zaku, I'm not saying no yet. I am considering the idea.

1208
01:32:13,720 --> 01:32:19,720
Oh, one more thing. As you already know, we New Yorkers already have an unlocked 2DX11 Red kit.

1209
01:32:19,720 --> 01:32:22,720
Yes, I've already played 2DX11 Red.

1210
01:32:22,720 --> 01:32:24,720
Where did 2DX Red go in New York?

1211
01:32:24,720 --> 01:32:28,720
This place called Tri-County Fair in Long Island.

1212
01:32:28,720 --> 01:32:31,720
Oh, okay. See, I didn't get a chance to go to Coney Island at all.

1213
01:32:31,720 --> 01:32:34,720
I mean, there's a lot in New York City, as you know.

1214
01:32:34,720 --> 01:32:37,720
So I didn't get a chance to really do everything. That's why I want to go back.

1215
01:32:37,720 --> 01:32:42,720
It's an unlocked machine, so we pretty much have all the other unlocks since the kit is straight from Japan.

1216
01:32:42,720 --> 01:32:47,520
it's used you know I had heard something about an in the groove 2

1217
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:52,880
machine that opened up somewhere in Michigan and it already had everything

1218
01:32:52,880 --> 01:32:56,000
unlocked and all these people saw all these new songs they weren't supposed to

1219
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:59,520
and then the next day the lock was back on and all the songs were gone and they

1220
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:03,640
didn't realize the anyway I don't know I don't know why that's all I don't know

1221
01:33:03,640 --> 01:33:05,980
why I thought to mention that I just kind of remembered that right now

1222
01:33:05,980 --> 01:33:09,960
because I was hearing this story just like yesterday so anyway I'm throwing

1223
01:33:09,960 --> 01:33:17,200
that out there. Yeah man, that's what's been going on in New York so far. So this Digital

1224
01:33:17,200 --> 01:33:20,780
Life tournament that's coming up, is this the one where they're giving away like thousands

1225
01:33:20,780 --> 01:33:25,000
of dollars or something for the freestyle? Yes, two grand is the grand prize for most

1226
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:29,680
if not all the events in the first place. So I know, now is Digital Life the same one

1227
01:33:29,680 --> 01:33:34,800
that Frequency went to last year and we interviewed him after that and he had had the run in with

1228
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:36,760
like much music and stuff?

1229
01:33:36,760 --> 01:33:47,760
Yeah, I basically told him about how you wanted to interview him and all that.

1230
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:49,480
Yeah, I remember that.

1231
01:33:49,480 --> 01:33:54,280
So yeah, I would love to go to that event if I can make it work, I don't know if I can.

1232
01:33:54,280 --> 01:33:55,280
But I will try.

1233
01:33:55,280 --> 01:33:57,360
See what you can do, man.

1234
01:33:57,360 --> 01:34:01,640
We would love to have you out there, and at least that would be good promotion-wise for

1235
01:34:01,640 --> 01:34:02,640
Orange Lounge.

1236
01:34:02,640 --> 01:34:03,840
I'm not thinking about it.

1237
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:05,140
Loki, what do you think?

1238
01:34:05,140 --> 01:34:07,040
If Dark Soccer can't go, you want to go?

1239
01:34:07,040 --> 01:34:11,440
I don't want to sit next to another grandpa on Southwest.

1240
01:34:11,440 --> 01:34:12,640
Somebody's got to go with me.

1241
01:34:12,640 --> 01:34:14,040
Well, hopefully Nellie will have a car,

1242
01:34:14,040 --> 01:34:15,840
because I'm kind of driving her to work.

1243
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:16,640
Oh, all right.

1244
01:34:16,640 --> 01:34:17,140
Well, we'll see.

1245
01:34:17,140 --> 01:34:18,040
We'll see what happens.

1246
01:34:18,040 --> 01:34:18,840
I don't know.

1247
01:34:18,840 --> 01:34:19,340
All right.

1248
01:34:19,340 --> 01:34:20,740
So what are you going to be doing for the digital life?

1249
01:34:20,740 --> 01:34:23,040
I assume if there's $2,000 on the line, you're going to be.

1250
01:34:23,040 --> 01:34:24,040
Yeah, freestyle.

1251
01:34:24,040 --> 01:34:27,240
I mean, I'm going to be entering freestyle, like I did last.

1252
01:34:27,240 --> 01:34:29,140
Have you picked your song yet?

1253
01:34:29,140 --> 01:34:31,940
I think I'm planning on doing Swing It from Fifth Mix,

1254
01:34:31,940 --> 01:34:38,340
trying to dress up like Pee Wee Herman with the platform shoes, red bow tie, the buzz cut,

1255
01:34:39,220 --> 01:34:42,900
the whole thing, the whole nine yards for that one. That's thinking about it. It's getting close

1256
01:34:42,900 --> 01:34:54,180
to that. That's dedicated. No, I love it. Most of the veteran freestylers in, you know, in the city,

1257
01:34:54,180 --> 01:34:58,500
basically, you know, they really like that, you know, they really have some good positive,

1258
01:34:58,500 --> 01:35:01,940
you know, positive impressions on it when I first told it to him.

1259
01:35:01,940 --> 01:35:07,420
This would be Legend of Zaku doing Freestyle at the Digital Life tournament.

1260
01:35:07,420 --> 01:35:14,420
Oh God.

1261
01:35:17,300 --> 01:35:22,680
Anyway, that had to be it. No, that's cool. I hope it works out for you.

1262
01:35:22,680 --> 01:35:26,900
Yeah. Well, I will see what I can do. Any other news you wanna share?

1263
01:35:26,900 --> 01:35:31,660
Mmm, that's about it. I told you what's been happening so far and what we already have.

1264
01:35:31,660 --> 01:35:36,900
Mmm, just waiting for October to roll by, pretty much.

1265
01:35:36,900 --> 01:35:39,400
Alright, so this tournament's gonna be big news then, huh?

1266
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:40,400
Yeah.

1267
01:35:40,400 --> 01:35:41,400
Alright, well we'll...

1268
01:35:41,400 --> 01:35:43,900
I just hope you could try to pull something.

1269
01:35:43,900 --> 01:35:47,900
We'll see, but all you other East Coasters, I know we have other East Coasters listening to the show,

1270
01:35:47,900 --> 01:35:51,900

1271
01:35:51,900 --> 01:35:52,900
Money, money, money.

1272
01:35:52,900 --> 01:35:53,900
Yeah.

1273
01:35:53,900 --> 01:35:57,220
low-key loads of money being given away doesn't just

1274
01:35:57,220 --> 01:35:59,500

01:36:56,720 --> 01:36:58,960
because they're doing that will article

1297
01:36:58,960 --> 01:37:02,040
about us in uh... my uh...

1298
01:37:02,040 --> 01:37:03,240

1299
01:37:03,240 --> 01:37:05,960

1300
01:37:05,960 --> 01:37:07,680

they wanted you know they're going to be just grab a screen capture of you from

1302
01:37:11,720 --> 01:37:15,840
uh... but i don't really like it i don't want the retarded pictures

1303
01:37:15,840 --> 01:37:19,280
I want a non-retarded picture. That's what I was looking for.

1304
01:37:19,280 --> 01:37:23,080
And unfortunately, every single picture I've taken of, you know, me,

1305
01:37:23,080 --> 01:37:27,280
has been a retarded one. I'm not retarded, so why do my pictures come out retarded?

1306
01:37:27,280 --> 01:37:28,280
That's what I want to know.

1307
01:37:28,280 --> 01:37:32,880
Oh yeah, a picture of my foot. That would be perfect.

1308
01:37:32,880 --> 01:37:36,080
Send the picture of your feet over from the second OB.

1309
01:37:36,080 --> 01:37:41,000
No! What?

1310
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:44,760
Okay, now Loki, we've just had a bit of anger, so let's, Dark Sakura, let's further

1311
01:37:44,760 --> 01:37:49,240
us down the un-mellow spiral what's there's somebody on the gorillas board I

1312
01:37:49,240 --> 01:37:54,240
post on I've been by the way made super mod on gorillas unofficial which I'm

1313
01:37:54,240 --> 01:38:00,620
very hurt but there's a person who I'm not gonna name names but who posts 75

1314
01:38:00,620 --> 01:38:07,880
posts today on their names start with the letter S no the letter T no but

1315
01:38:07,880 --> 01:38:11,720
someone but there's a thread on here that says describe the person above you

1316
01:38:11,720 --> 01:38:17,880
and he put does not love Katamari or his cousins I'm sorry he's the prince his

1317
01:38:17,880 --> 01:38:27,600
name is not Katamari huh just people frustrate me it's a video game related

1318
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:31,240
and you don't want to know what though this isn't the only person that I have

1319
01:38:31,240 --> 01:38:37,360
seen this happen seen say stuff like this on a variety of boards that they

1320
01:38:37,360 --> 01:38:41,600
think that the primary character in a game is named after the game after the

1321
01:38:41,600 --> 01:38:44,940
game when they're like did you know that when you play Legend of Zelda you're

1322
01:38:44,940 --> 01:38:51,680
actually playing Zelda moving around I know I know but it's just I would say

1323
01:38:51,680 --> 01:38:55,160
that is you know people if you're gonna be a fan of the game actually know

1324
01:38:55,160 --> 01:38:59,000
something about it but it messy in some cases you lock out there you look you

1325
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,800
luck out you luck out because the Super Mario Brothers you actually play as

1326
01:39:01,800 --> 01:39:10,800
Super Mario yeah but I've heard people call Luigi Mario 2 and green Mario this

1327
01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:17,960
green Mario. Yes, I kid you not. Alright. I just, I dug this up and I had to play it

1328
01:39:17,960 --> 01:39:22,760
because it's been like three weeks since I've done this, so I need, I need a little bit,

1329
01:39:22,760 --> 01:39:26,600
I need a little pick-me-up. I need a little bit of un-mellow here. God! I already know

1330
01:39:26,600 --> 01:39:35,960
what this is. Hey, Loki, what do you think about gay sex? Oh, it's so much fun. Then

1331
01:39:35,960 --> 01:39:40,280
I'll never get old, will it? Actually, it will get old. Cause there's another joke we

1332
01:39:40,280 --> 01:39:44,360
used to do the same thing for. I know. But then you'll just do something stupid and we'll

1333
01:39:44,360 --> 01:39:51,200
have something else. Hey! I forgot, well I actually didn't forget to mention, um, September

1334
01:39:51,200 --> 01:39:58,720
11th. No, you're not using that picture! Thank you to the chatroom listener who sent us that

1335
01:39:58,720 --> 01:40:05,880
picture of Loki. Who did that? Yes, you have picked the most retarded shot of me, and-

1336
01:40:05,880 --> 01:40:12,880
I was going to say, whatever those things are, that internet joke needs to die.

1337
01:40:35,880 --> 01:40:41,960
die whitey andy but that's not that i think i think i mean anyway um... you're

1338
01:40:41,960 --> 01:40:45,560
it's it's some catchphrase that started the whole thing i don't remember

1339
01:40:45,560 --> 01:40:49,960
okay wait but that was not an actual whitey m n d site that was the

1340
01:40:49,960 --> 01:40:51,360
uh... knockoff

1341
01:40:51,360 --> 01:40:54,300
uh... whitey m n d site that's actually some of these placeholder for the real

1342
01:40:54,300 --> 01:40:54,780
site

1343
01:40:54,780 --> 01:40:57,020
however we had another listener

1344
01:40:57,020 --> 01:40:58,160
head on over

1345
01:40:58,160 --> 01:41:02,420
to whitey m n d and actually came up with this and i'm letting this up right

1346
01:41:02,420 --> 01:41:03,600
now for the chat

1347
01:41:03,600 --> 01:41:04,820
are for uh...

1348
01:41:04,820 --> 01:41:08,440
dark sakura to uh... i'm not looking at this work

1349
01:41:08,440 --> 01:41:12,640
it's really funny things give me a headache the kid i could you not

1350
01:41:12,640 --> 01:41:14,720
over the graphic

1351
01:41:14,720 --> 01:41:17,800
hey loki what do you think about the exact

1352
01:41:17,800 --> 01:41:19,140
uh... it's so much fun

1353
01:41:19,140 --> 01:41:22,660
and then there's actually what do you think that i think that was the having

1354
01:41:22,660 --> 01:41:24,320
gave them

1355
01:41:24,320 --> 01:41:27,060
okay what do you think about the exact

1356
01:41:27,060 --> 01:41:29,280
uh...

1357
01:41:29,280 --> 01:41:33,680
loki what do you think that you had a picture of me drunk

1358
01:41:33,680 --> 01:41:40,180
September 11th, I'm going to be getting drunk here.

1359
01:41:40,180 --> 01:41:42,200
You're the man now, dog.

1360
01:41:42,200 --> 01:41:43,760
That's what YTMND stands for.

1361
01:41:43,760 --> 01:41:45,920
I think it's something that Randy Jackson said once.

1362
01:41:45,920 --> 01:41:48,160
And by the way, I'm not trying to be mean about anybody.

1363
01:41:48,160 --> 01:41:50,480
I just had to vent for a moment.

1364
01:41:50,480 --> 01:41:52,600
Oh, yeah.

1365
01:41:52,600 --> 01:41:53,880
I made a public correction.

1366
01:41:53,880 --> 01:41:55,240
OK, so September 11th, you're going

1367
01:41:55,240 --> 01:41:56,880
to be drinking because it's your birthday, right?

1368
01:41:56,880 --> 01:41:59,120
So do you have the day after off work or something?

1369
01:41:59,120 --> 01:42:01,640
Yeah, sure, whatever.

1370
01:42:01,640 --> 01:42:10,980
Yeah, I actually had to load that YTMND site in Explorer.

1371
01:42:10,980 --> 01:42:15,440
It doesn't work in Firefox, because Firefox is smart to block those things that repeat

1372
01:42:15,440 --> 01:42:18,680
the sound files over and over and the graphics over and over.

1373
01:42:18,680 --> 01:42:19,680
You know what, though?

1374
01:42:19,680 --> 01:42:26,000
Those things, it's like when they would give those, you know, when they entertain a blonde

1375
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:32,040
It's the same type of stupid things.

1376
01:42:32,040 --> 01:42:37,740
You know, I did see a really, really funny one, though, once, and it was, I don't even

1377
01:42:37,740 --> 01:42:41,700
know if I should repeat this on the air, but it was that screen capture from Mike Tyson's

1378
01:42:41,700 --> 01:42:42,700
Punch Out.

1379
01:42:42,700 --> 01:42:44,580
Remember when you would, like, beat a stage?

1380
01:42:44,580 --> 01:42:48,300
It would show, like, Little Mac in training, and he's running through, like, the streets

1381
01:42:48,300 --> 01:42:53,500
of New York, and it shows his coach, which was this really big, fat, black guy, remember

1382
01:42:53,500 --> 01:42:57,300
that, like, Al Roker used to be, that was on the bike, that was kind of riding in front

1383
01:42:57,300 --> 01:43:06,420
of him, pacing him. And it's, um, it's, nigga stole my bike. This place. And it's just really

1384
01:43:06,420 --> 01:43:09,860
funny because that's not really what's happening in the picture, but then when you look at

1385
01:43:09,860 --> 01:43:14,820
it in that perspective, and it shows a little animation, it kind of looks like it. That

1386
01:43:14,820 --> 01:43:19,020
the guy stole his bike. Those things don't amuse me. That's the funniest one I ever saw.

1387
01:43:19,020 --> 01:43:26,020
I think that those are meant to amuse the easily amused, and I'd say complex amusement.

1388
01:43:26,020 --> 01:43:28,020
I need something with more substance to respond.

1389
01:43:28,020 --> 01:43:34,020
You're a, oh, what do they call those? Like a, you're a, you have snobby humor.

1390
01:43:34,020 --> 01:43:36,020
I can't help it. Well, I did the little humor.

1391
01:43:36,020 --> 01:43:38,020
You're stuck up when it comes to your humor.

1392
01:43:38,020 --> 01:43:42,020
I did the little humor thing in my life journal.

1393
01:43:42,020 --> 01:43:46,020
Anyway, enough about YTMND.

1394
01:43:46,020 --> 01:43:50,020
So yeah,

1395
01:43:50,020 --> 01:43:54,020
I need a non-retarded looking picture. We'll see what we can work out.

1396
01:43:54,020 --> 01:43:58,020
I take retarded looking pictures, so it's kind of tough.

1397
01:43:58,020 --> 01:44:02,020
Maybe if I stop slouching, because when I slouch it looks like my face is like

1398
01:44:02,020 --> 01:44:06,020
exploded. You know what this show needs?

1399
01:44:06,020 --> 01:44:10,020
An enema. No, more cowbell.

1400
01:44:10,020 --> 01:44:13,500
I had to make a Batman reference.

1401
01:44:13,500 --> 01:44:16,220
Have you seen, well Walken was in one of the, uh, um,

1402
01:44:16,220 --> 01:44:17,220
Walken for President!

1403
01:44:17,220 --> 01:44:18,220
I was just going to bring this up.

1404
01:44:18,220 --> 01:44:22,520
This is this big internet site that's been, um, going around the internet, Walken2008.com

1405
01:44:22,520 --> 01:44:23,520
or.org.

1406
01:44:23,520 --> 01:44:24,520
You know what?

1407
01:44:24,520 --> 01:44:25,860
I'm not going to, I'm not going to, uh,

1408
01:44:25,860 --> 01:44:26,860
I'm sure it's fake.

1409
01:44:26,860 --> 01:44:30,940
Yeah, I was pretty sure it's fake, but the thing is, is if, if something like that were

1410
01:44:30,940 --> 01:44:35,460
to pass, first of all, you need to make sure that if they're going to, if somebody's going

1411
01:44:35,460 --> 01:44:38,300
to run for president, put all of the issues up there first and foremost.

1412
01:44:38,300 --> 01:44:41,660
That site was very, very poorly done.

1413
01:44:41,660 --> 01:44:42,660
Very poorly done.

1414
01:44:42,660 --> 01:44:48,180
Well, the domain register or whatever was, like, a Lullerskates or whatever or something.

1415
01:44:48,180 --> 01:44:49,180
Lullerskates.

1416
01:44:49,180 --> 01:44:51,180
So, yeah.

1417
01:44:51,180 --> 01:44:53,580
All right.

1418
01:44:53,580 --> 01:44:57,700
Anyway, I think it's about time we get into the Orange Ons Radio Cage Match.

1419
01:44:57,700 --> 01:44:59,860
How's that sound, kids?

1420
01:44:59,860 --> 01:45:00,860
Sounds terrific.

1421
01:45:00,860 --> 01:45:01,860
Why not?

1422
01:45:01,860 --> 01:45:05,460
Okay, so which song of mine did we use last week that won?

1423
01:45:05,460 --> 01:45:08,020
Whatever the first one you put in there was on the disc.

1424
01:45:08,020 --> 01:45:13,060
I got to remember. I hope, uh, we could just start over. Yeah, I'm in trouble because I

1425
01:45:13,060 --> 01:45:20,060
don't know if I remember which song it was. Do you have any idea what song it was? What

1426
01:45:20,060 --> 01:45:27,060
are my choices? Shit, somebody in chat help us out. I'm sorry, Rob. You didn't like the

1427
01:45:27,060 --> 01:45:32,640
song, I assume. No, because it sounded generic. I'm looking, yeah, I purposely put a generic

1428
01:45:32,640 --> 01:45:38,460
one in there because I knew you'd love those ones um oh this is great we should

1429
01:45:38,460 --> 01:45:44,540
do a cowbell mix was it jet set in the name of love no that wasn't it I did

1430
01:45:44,540 --> 01:45:48,360
that one earlier why don't we start with a challenge

1431
01:45:48,360 --> 01:45:54,100
he's iTunes I seriously don't I seriously don't know what song I had left

1432
01:45:54,100 --> 01:46:00,300
in the cage match so I guess we'll start over fine so we'll start over tonight so

1433
01:46:00,300 --> 01:46:02,600
I gotta find a song and while I find a song

1434
01:46:03,280 --> 01:46:08,520
We're gonna start off with dark soccer stick because it's the only one I have ready to go. So dark soccer

1435
01:46:08,520 --> 01:46:12,120
What did you pick tonight for tonight's kid match? Um, I put in

1436
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:14,960
it's I put it in the

1437
01:46:15,880 --> 01:46:19,900
Okay, what the afterbirth before might be after first the fortune cookie

1438
01:46:20,280 --> 01:46:25,980
But I couldn't think of anything else than MC Chris is just awesome. So it's MC Chris with geek

1439
01:46:25,980 --> 01:46:32,980
Alright, song number one in tonight's cage match, MC Chris with Geek. Here it is. Enjoy.

1440
01:46:55,980 --> 01:47:01,980
Your beads on the wall, my face, my face on TV

1441
01:47:01,980 --> 01:47:03,980
Make this a piece of pungent odor of a pile holder

1442
01:47:03,980 --> 01:47:05,980
Fan kickers coming 60 clips upon the sonar

1443
01:47:05,980 --> 01:47:08,980
They're gonna fold me over like a chopper keeper folder

1444
01:47:08,980 --> 01:47:10,980
If this is D&D you'd see me jumping to a portal

1445
01:47:10,980 --> 01:47:12,980
I'm a geek, spread G-E-E-K

1446
01:47:12,980 --> 01:47:15,980
I bring my boys in the basement about every day

1447
01:47:15,980 --> 01:47:17,980
A card table, common books, and cans of coke

1448
01:47:17,980 --> 01:47:20,980
But that be blood of another that I saw on shows

1449
01:47:20,980 --> 01:47:21,980
We got style

1450
01:47:21,980 --> 01:47:23,980
Tape on our glasses, sticks on our faces

1451
01:47:23,980 --> 01:47:26,540
All our faces they hit, all our acts are shining shoes

1452
01:47:26,540 --> 01:47:28,460
Bell buckles and pocket protectors

1453
01:47:28,460 --> 01:47:30,460
Straight to our backpacks like my main man Vic

1454
01:47:30,460 --> 01:47:32,060
Once we got problems

1455
01:47:32,060 --> 01:47:33,180
Made me the jocks

1456
01:47:33,180 --> 01:47:35,340
The MTV suckers with cartoons and their cocks

1457
01:47:35,340 --> 01:47:37,660
Otherwise soon as the motherfuckers touch the dick

1458
01:47:37,660 --> 01:47:38,860
If I was Wolverine

1459
01:47:38,860 --> 01:47:40,060
You'd hear my knuckles go stick

1460
01:47:40,060 --> 01:47:41,180
I'm not perfect

1461
01:47:41,180 --> 01:47:42,620
The before picture of Peter Parker

1462
01:47:42,620 --> 01:47:44,300
Always tripping, drop my tray in front of the girl

1463
01:47:44,300 --> 01:47:46,220
But always fuck cuz I got brains

1464
01:47:46,220 --> 01:47:47,260
Fuck B's and C's

1465
01:47:47,260 --> 01:47:49,260
I got a great point average higher than Henderson

1466
01:47:49,260 --> 01:47:52,220
And you see what I'm taking on me

1467
01:47:52,220 --> 01:47:59,220
Because I'm a geek, I'm thanks to you, you're thanks to me

1468
01:47:59,220 --> 01:48:04,220
Well, one day, I'm gonna pack heaps

1469
01:48:04,220 --> 01:48:09,220
Your face on the wall, my face, my face on me

1470
01:48:09,220 --> 01:48:11,220
Don't fuck with the geek, just cause he got a gift

1471
01:48:11,220 --> 01:48:13,220
You get my way, bitch, you get a broken neck pinch

1472
01:48:13,220 --> 01:48:16,220
One night I didn't go to sleep, off playing Risk

1473
01:48:16,220 --> 01:48:18,220
At dawn, I won, got global dominance

1474
01:48:18,220 --> 01:48:21,220
But in the hallway, it's completely different shit

1475
01:48:21,220 --> 01:48:23,380
Can't get my locker open and my pants are always split

1476
01:48:23,380 --> 01:48:25,940
Can't seem to catch a ride, can't ever get a date

1477
01:48:25,940 --> 01:48:28,420
But in my mind, seven to nine things were great

1478
01:48:28,420 --> 01:48:29,460
Crap, night fight!

1479
01:48:29,460 --> 01:48:30,580
Pre-Madonna's prevail

1480
01:48:30,580 --> 01:48:32,980
I'm a homo-sight in lines from the holy grail

1481
01:48:32,980 --> 01:48:35,380
Stuffed nose, extra swollen glands

1482
01:48:35,380 --> 01:48:37,780
Never been kissed, never been on hand

1483
01:48:37,780 --> 01:48:40,740
Just bust my biscuits over Britney in a bubble bath

1484
01:48:40,740 --> 01:48:43,060
Darth Vader within hand-scape full of collabs

1485
01:48:43,060 --> 01:48:45,460
The dragon died from a heart attack

1486
01:48:45,460 --> 01:48:47,780
You may advance and you're up to armor class

1487
01:48:47,780 --> 01:48:49,940
Being a geek, it ain't so bad

1488
01:48:49,940 --> 01:48:52,340
I can't get laid, I got your pantomime stashed

1489
01:48:52,340 --> 01:48:54,740
And I'm mind jam-packed with sci-fi facts

1490
01:48:54,740 --> 01:48:57,140
Ged Nox, rock, dynamite, kick-ass

1491
01:48:57,140 --> 01:48:59,140
Stop banging on me

1492
01:48:59,140 --> 01:49:01,140
Because I love you

1493
01:49:01,140 --> 01:49:04,140
Stop banging on me

1494
01:49:04,140 --> 01:49:06,140
Because I love you

1495
01:49:06,140 --> 01:49:09,140
But I wanna be safe

1496
01:49:09,140 --> 01:49:11,140
I'm gonna pack you

1497
01:49:11,140 --> 01:49:13,140
With my face on the wall

1498
01:49:13,140 --> 01:49:15,140
With my face

1499
01:49:15,140 --> 01:49:17,140
My name's on TV!

1500
01:49:28,340 --> 01:49:30,340
Stop thinking on me

1501
01:49:30,740 --> 01:49:32,740
Because I'm a thief

1502
01:49:33,140 --> 01:49:35,140
I'm straight to you

1503
01:49:35,540 --> 01:49:37,540
You're straight to me

1504
01:49:37,940 --> 01:49:39,940
Well, one day

1505
01:49:40,340 --> 01:49:42,340
I'm gonna pat you

1506
01:49:42,340 --> 01:49:49,340
Your bait's on the wall, my bait, my bait is on TV

1507
01:49:49,340 --> 01:49:56,340
Because I'm a thief, I'm safe to you, you're safe to me

1508
01:49:56,340 --> 01:50:01,340
Well, what do you say? I'm gonna pack it

1509
01:50:01,340 --> 01:50:03,340
Your babe's on the wall

1510
01:50:03,340 --> 01:50:14,380
All right, song number one in tonight's CAGEMASH MC Chris with Geek. Remember you guys will

1511
01:50:14,380 --> 01:50:18,420
be voting for your favorite and then that winner will go into rotation all week long

1512
01:50:18,420 --> 01:50:25,060
on Orange Lounge Radio. But we'll give you our opinions first and try to sway your vote.

1513
01:50:25,060 --> 01:50:27,780
So Dark Sakura, it was your pick, but what did you think?

1514
01:50:27,780 --> 01:50:32,900
It's MC Chris, he gets a 10. Just because that song is like high school for how many

1515
01:50:32,900 --> 01:50:41,420
people ever it's the perfect the perfect description Loki I get the seven I just

1516
01:50:41,420 --> 01:50:49,580
wasn't feeling it I don't know for me MC Chris is kind of one of those folks

1517
01:50:49,580 --> 01:50:54,900
where I think the joke gets old for me I think he's kind of a niche guy I'm

1518
01:50:54,900 --> 01:51:00,380
gonna get the joke I I do sorry I give it a six because it did have a catchy

1519
01:51:00,380 --> 01:51:07,380
I'll give it that. And he doesn't have chicks singing in most of his songs, so that was kind of a neat little addition.

1520
01:51:07,380 --> 01:51:10,380
Alright, moving on. Loki, you wanna go next or you want me to go next?

1521
01:51:10,380 --> 01:51:12,380
Whatever.

1522
01:51:12,380 --> 01:51:14,380
You go next then. What did you pick tonight?

1523
01:51:14,380 --> 01:51:19,380
I picked a song from Wipeout Pure. Hell if I remember what it's called.

1524
01:51:19,380 --> 01:51:23,380
How about, let me give you a hint, it's called Onyx by Cold Storage.

1525
01:51:23,380 --> 01:51:30,220
yeah onyx by cold storage it's the first levels music and it's cool and it's my

1526
01:51:30,220 --> 01:51:36,240
fallback pick because I couldn't find shit oh that's always impressive so yeah

1527
01:51:36,240 --> 01:51:40,420
it's not bad I liked it but yeah whatever all right here we go song

1528
01:51:40,420 --> 01:51:47,420
Point number two, cold storage with Onyx.

1529
01:55:10,420 --> 01:55:11,420
Hey!

1530
01:55:11,420 --> 01:55:12,420
Hey!

1531
01:55:12,420 --> 01:55:13,420
Hey!

1532
01:55:13,420 --> 01:55:14,420
Hey!

1533
01:55:14,420 --> 01:55:15,420
Hey!

1534
01:55:15,420 --> 01:55:16,420
Hey!

1535
01:56:46,420 --> 01:57:14,420
Song number two, Cold Storage with Onyx.

1536
01:57:14,420 --> 01:57:17,420
to see what we thought of that Dark Sakura.

1537
01:57:17,420 --> 01:57:19,420
Generic, five, sorry.

1538
01:57:19,420 --> 01:57:21,420
Loki.

1539
01:57:21,420 --> 01:57:25,420
He gets a nine, because it's better than Empty Chris.

1540
01:57:25,420 --> 01:57:30,420
I also give that song a six, because I found it to be pretty generic as well, I have to say.

1541
01:57:30,420 --> 01:57:33,420
Sorry.

1542
01:57:33,420 --> 01:57:36,420
Alright, let's go to my pick, uh, song number three tonight.

1543
01:57:36,420 --> 01:57:39,420
Since I can't remember what won the cage match two weeks ago...

1544
01:57:39,420 --> 01:57:40,420
Oh, it was something generic, don't worry.

1545
01:57:40,420 --> 01:57:45,100
Yeah, something generic that I would have given a six anyway, so let's just let's just go to a new song

1546
01:57:45,380 --> 01:57:51,660
I'm gonna pick this and I hope that this isn't generic. I actually decided to not do a trance type song tonight

1547
01:57:51,660 --> 01:57:56,820
I'm doing something. There's this band. I absolutely love and a lot of America loves this band, too

1548
01:57:56,820 --> 01:57:59,640
It's Frau Frau and you might remember I used to whore the cage match with these guys

1549
01:58:00,100 --> 01:58:05,480
And they had a big song that was in the movie Garden State called let go and it was really big and stuff

1550
01:58:05,480 --> 01:58:08,920
Well Imogen Heath who's the singer she just recently

1551
01:58:08,920 --> 01:58:14,440
like mortgaged her house so she could self-finance a new album and it's fucking

1552
01:58:14,440 --> 01:58:17,700
great and although a lot of it's really mellow I like this song and I think it

1553
01:58:17,700 --> 01:58:20,980
might work for CAGEMATCH so I'm picking this song it's Imogen Heap and it's

1554
01:58:20,980 --> 01:58:27,980
called I am in love with you. Enjoy!

1555
01:58:50,980 --> 01:58:55,980
I am in love with you, live for the moment

1556
01:58:59,480 --> 01:59:01,980
Right now, another piece

1557
01:59:03,980 --> 01:59:05,980
Right now, another piece

1558
01:59:05,980 --> 01:59:08,980
Just like that, like that

1559
01:59:08,980 --> 01:59:10,980
Another one, babe

1560
01:59:10,980 --> 01:59:13,980
And kiss me for longer

1561
01:59:13,980 --> 01:59:22,980
Oh hey baby, don't you run away Oh hey baby, don't you run away

1562
01:59:22,980 --> 01:59:25,980
Come here and finish what you started

1563
01:59:25,980 --> 01:59:45,980
I am in love with you, baby I am in love with you, yeah

1564
01:59:45,980 --> 01:59:47,980
At least for this moment

1565
01:59:51,980 --> 01:59:54,980
Spit second and it's all in focus

1566
01:59:55,980 --> 01:59:59,980
Spit second and it's all in focus

1567
02:00:00,980 --> 02:00:02,980
Spit second and it's all in focus

1568
02:00:02,980 --> 02:00:05,980
Oh, let this blood dry

1569
02:00:08,980 --> 02:00:11,980
Don't go and get yourself in situations

1570
02:00:11,980 --> 02:00:18,980
Don't go and get yourself in situations only that you can't handle

1571
02:00:18,980 --> 02:00:22,980
Don't forget you

1572
02:00:22,980 --> 02:00:26,980
Don't forget you

1573
02:00:26,980 --> 02:00:31,980
Don't forget you

1574
02:01:01,980 --> 02:01:04,080
I'm not in love with you

1575
02:01:06,240 --> 02:01:09,900
I'm not in love with you baby

1576
02:01:10,700 --> 02:01:13,140
I'm not in love with you

1577
02:01:13,640 --> 02:01:15,560
now I know

1578
02:01:16,400 --> 02:01:19,480
that I feel like I do

1579
02:01:20,740 --> 02:01:24,040
that I feel like I do

1580
02:01:24,040 --> 02:01:40,040
Song number three, Imogen Heap. I am in love with you. Let's see if we were in love with

1581
02:01:40,040 --> 02:01:42,240
that or if we want to break up. Dark Sakura.

1582
02:01:42,240 --> 02:01:50,320
You know, I really like her stuff but it sounded really kind of repetitive. In fact, a lot

1583
02:01:50,320 --> 02:01:57,320
of her stuff sounds the same. It wasn't bad at all, so it gets a 7.5.

1584
02:02:20,320 --> 02:02:21,320
Garbage is cool!

1585
02:02:21,320 --> 02:02:22,320
Yeah, like, garbage is cool!

1586
02:02:22,320 --> 02:02:24,320
No, but, um...

1587
02:02:24,320 --> 02:02:25,320
You know what I mean, though.

1588
02:02:25,320 --> 02:02:27,320
But that particular song is kind of, um...

1589
02:02:27,320 --> 02:02:31,320
It's the more upbeat one, if you could call it that, even though the lyrics are kind of depressing.

1590
02:02:31,320 --> 02:02:33,320
Uh, so I give it an 8.

1591
02:02:33,320 --> 02:02:34,320
Alright!

1592
02:02:34,320 --> 02:02:36,320
Actually, no, I give it a 6.

1593
02:02:36,320 --> 02:02:40,320
So that way, I've given all three songs tonight a 6, and that's 666.

1594
02:02:40,320 --> 02:02:41,320
That would be cool.

1595
02:02:41,320 --> 02:02:42,320
Anyway...

1596
02:02:42,320 --> 02:02:44,320
Yeah, I'm lame. Shut up.

1597
02:02:44,320 --> 02:02:46,320
Let's recap, and then you guys can place your votes.

1598
02:02:46,320 --> 02:02:59,520
song number one you can vote for tonight was MC Chris with geek and song number

1599
02:02:59,520 --> 02:03:04,240
two you can vote for tonight is cold storage onyx

1600
02:03:04,240 --> 02:03:24,840
And song number three tonight, Imogen Heap, I'm In Love With You.

1601
02:03:24,840 --> 02:03:27,160
Okay guys, place vote now.

1602
02:03:27,160 --> 02:03:32,520

1603
02:03:32,520 --> 02:03:34,220
number three.

1604
02:03:34,220 --> 02:03:41,060
And we will reveal those votes as soon as we have them added all up.

1605
02:03:41,060 --> 02:03:46,440
Loki, this is the part of the show where I'd like to go to you for a sim scene update.

1606
02:03:46,440 --> 02:03:51,180
You know, and normally I'd say I don't have anything, but I actually do, surprisingly

1607
02:03:51,180 --> 02:03:52,180
enough.

1608
02:03:52,180 --> 02:03:58,420
First thing is, Food Mix 2 finally has a goddamn date that's gonna be released, and that goddamn

1609
02:03:58,420 --> 02:04:00,720
date will be September 15th.

1610
02:04:00,720 --> 02:04:03,140
And what can you expect but 50 new songs.

1611
02:04:03,140 --> 02:04:10,140
So that's pretty awesome. So yeah, that'll be something we'll be covering a little bit more a bit later on.

1612
02:04:10,140 --> 02:04:18,140
The other thing is that Tourney Mix 6 Download Pack 1 is available. I have not actually downloaded Download Pack 1, but it's up there.

1613
02:04:18,140 --> 02:04:25,140
So if you go to ddrei.com, you can visit the last of Tourney Mix. I'm sure we're all thankful for that.

1614
02:04:25,140 --> 02:04:30,620
and yeah I think that's pretty much all I had right now I know there's some

1615
02:04:30,620 --> 02:04:38,540
other ones but I can't remember but yeah so food mix 2 that's pretty awesome

1616
02:04:38,540 --> 02:04:46,100
alright super food mix news yeah I'm excited about food mix 2 now see if in

1617
02:04:46,100 --> 02:04:51,420
the groove was like food mix 2 it would be awesome if food mix 2 there's that's

1618
02:04:51,420 --> 02:05:09,420
That's the thing, it's got polish to it. I mean, everything, it looks professional. It looks like if, honestly, if they put it in its own game, if Konami were to, you know, go to the food mix guys and say, hey, make us a game, you know, we'll publish it for you, it would be a DDR game. It would look good.

1619
02:05:09,420 --> 02:05:16,300
I want to mention this because we haven't really gotten a chance to yet.

1620
02:05:16,300 --> 02:05:18,100
Actually, there's a couple things I want to talk about.

1621
02:05:18,100 --> 02:05:20,400
Let's go to this.

1622
02:05:20,400 --> 02:05:24,180
This is a story about the Pump It Up US song list.

1623
02:05:24,180 --> 02:05:27,900
Apparently some folks are actually already getting a hold of this game somehow.

1624
02:05:27,900 --> 02:05:31,260
I think it's because they're in the industry, so they know people that know people.

1625
02:05:31,260 --> 02:05:36,200
But for the rest of us, we get it on the 31st of this month, I want to say, is when Pump

1626
02:05:36,200 --> 02:05:37,200
It Up comes out.

1627
02:05:37,200 --> 02:05:43,000
this 101 songs on the song list freaking crazy right not bad for first yeah not

1628
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:49,040
bad at all just a whole shitload of Banya songs I can't even read all these Banya

1629
02:05:49,040 --> 02:05:52,400
songs there's so damn many but if there's a Banya song you like Mr.

1630
02:05:52,400 --> 02:05:58,360
Larpus, Beethoven's Virus, Turkey March, B like all the big ones they're all

1631
02:05:58,360 --> 02:06:05,920
there you know you want it that's all there also some you know kind of what

1632
02:06:05,920 --> 02:06:12,200
US Known Songs, Name of the Game, Crystal Method, Walkie Talkie Man, Stereogram, I Love

1633
02:06:12,200 --> 02:06:18,520
You Baby, Pandera, Let's Groove, Earth Wind and Fire, Little Less Conversation, the remix

1634
02:06:18,520 --> 02:06:22,000
of the Elvis song, and Rapper's Delight by the Sugarhill Gang.

1635
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:26,000
A lot of those were kind of sort of announced previously, but they are on the official song

1636
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:27,000
list.

1637
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:31,040
Also some K-Pop coming over, which I think is kind of cool.

1638
02:06:31,040 --> 02:06:32,120
Just a whole lot of other songs.

1639
02:06:32,120 --> 02:06:35,120
I'm just kind of scanning through the list, seeing what I can find in here.

1640
02:06:38,120 --> 02:06:41,120
Come to Me and Funky Tonight by Klon, of course, are coming over.

1641
02:06:42,120 --> 02:06:47,120
Empire of the Sun, Novasonic, Boa, Valenti.

1642
02:06:48,120 --> 02:06:50,120
Boa, that's cool.

1643
02:06:50,120 --> 02:06:52,120
Yeah, I thought that was pretty cool too.

1644
02:06:53,120 --> 02:06:56,120
Let's see, what else is on here that I recognize?

1645
02:06:56,120 --> 02:06:58,120
Shake It Up by Rod.

1646
02:06:58,120 --> 02:07:02,580
So you know what guys, just head on over to Beat, or I'm sorry, either BamaniStyle.com

1647
02:07:02,580 --> 02:07:06,740
has the list, or there's actually a thread in the DDR UK forum as well that both have

1648
02:07:06,740 --> 02:07:07,900
the list.

1649
02:07:07,900 --> 02:07:08,900
Check it out.

1650
02:07:08,900 --> 02:07:12,940
I'm actually, you know, even though I said earlier in the show, I actually prefer Integroove

1651
02:07:12,940 --> 02:07:15,860
to Pump It Up because I don't like Pump It Up's interface, I still want to give the home

1652
02:07:15,860 --> 02:07:16,860
version a shot.

1653
02:07:16,860 --> 02:07:17,860
I think it might be fun to play at home.

1654
02:07:17,860 --> 02:07:22,360
And especially with like 101 freaking songs, that's going to be hard to wear out.

1655
02:07:22,360 --> 02:07:25,320
So I definitely will check this game out and let you know what I think.

1656
02:07:25,320 --> 02:07:32,320
I wish I could have gotten an advance copy!

1657
02:07:33,880 --> 02:07:38,180
So, speaking of Pump It Up, we're working on some little extra news we might have on

1658
02:07:38,180 --> 02:07:40,100
that for a little later in the show.

1659
02:07:40,100 --> 02:07:43,360
Also, we've got to talk about DDR with fire.

1660
02:07:43,360 --> 02:07:44,880
Well,

1661
02:07:44,880 --> 02:07:49,280
you know, Dance Dance Emulation, we talked about it a while back, there was going to be a

1662
02:07:49,280 --> 02:07:50,760
Burning Man in this

1663
02:07:50,760 --> 02:07:52,960
fire festival that's in Oakland.

1664
02:07:52,960 --> 02:07:59,960
I was just about to get to this, yes. I've been teasing it like the whole show, and now I'm finally getting to it, but that's alright.

1665
02:07:59,960 --> 02:08:10,960
It looks awesome, from what I've seen gameplay-wise. They had a lot of hardware trouble, though, because I guess the pads broke, the thing crashed, all that type of thing.

1666
02:08:10,960 --> 02:08:14,960
But I got to see there's a little bit of footage on the website, actually, that shows...

1667
02:08:14,960 --> 02:08:26,960
Yes, actually DDRFreak posted a video about this and I wanted to show this, if I could get to it, so we could have a little bit of movie nights.

1668
02:08:26,960 --> 02:08:34,960
And now, oh darn it, I can't find the video. I can bring it up again real fast here. So you actually watched the video, Loki, of this?

1669
02:08:34,960 --> 02:08:35,960
Yes.

1670
02:08:35,960 --> 02:08:36,960
And what did you think?

1671
02:08:36,960 --> 02:08:54,960
That was interesting. The guy in the suit reminded me of the Bunnyman from the Intel commercials, but it was an interesting idea. I don't know, it's just one of those Burning Man things, because they've got a lot of weird things that they do at Burning Man, and that would be one of them, so.

1672
02:08:54,960 --> 02:08:57,960
You crazy kids. It looks interesting.

1673
02:08:57,960 --> 02:08:59,960
Yeah.

1674
02:08:59,960 --> 02:09:03,960
Let me see, let me see, because JB, you probably haven't seen this yet, right?

1675
02:09:03,960 --> 02:09:04,960
Probably not.

1676
02:09:04,960 --> 02:09:05,960
Let me show this to you here.

1677
02:09:05,960 --> 02:09:06,960
I can't see through you.

1678
02:09:06,960 --> 02:09:08,960
Hold on, I'm gonna move. I just gotta open this up first.

1679
02:09:08,960 --> 02:09:09,960
Okay, here it comes.

1680
02:09:11,960 --> 02:09:13,960
Oh, wait, we need some music. We need some music. Hold on.

1681
02:09:13,960 --> 02:09:14,960
Oh, yeah, I have.

1682
02:09:14,960 --> 02:09:15,960
Did you? Oh, here it is again.

1683
02:09:19,960 --> 02:09:21,960
Play a little after the game of love.

1684
02:09:21,960 --> 02:09:22,960
Then...

1685
02:09:22,960 --> 02:09:23,960
Whoosh! Fire!

1686
02:09:25,960 --> 02:09:26,960
Whoosh! Fire!

1687
02:09:27,960 --> 02:09:29,960
Yep, that's pretty much, uh, dance simulation.

1688
02:09:29,960 --> 02:09:30,960
Whoosh! Fire!

1689
02:09:31,960 --> 02:09:32,960
Hey, fire in the spring.

1690
02:09:32,960 --> 02:09:39,960
DDR whoosh fire mix.

1691
02:09:41,040 --> 02:09:44,400
I'll say it. What a stupid idea.

1692
02:09:44,400 --> 02:09:45,640
I'm sorry.

1693
02:09:45,640 --> 02:09:50,280
Now if you really caught on fire and was dancing on fire, that might be cool.

1694
02:09:50,280 --> 02:09:54,440
This is somebody's inside joke gone like way, way, way too far.

1695
02:09:54,440 --> 02:09:59,280
I'm just waiting for someone to put themselves on fire because they saw them

1696
02:09:59,280 --> 02:10:04,000
I love it because on the DDR Freak story it says, you know, it links to the article and

1697
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:09,960
everything and it says, note, we urge you not to try this at home, you know, like, you

1698
02:10:09,960 --> 02:10:14,160
know what, don't even put the disclaimer, let somebody try it at home, that's Darwinism,

1699
02:10:14,160 --> 02:10:15,160
kids.

1700
02:10:15,160 --> 02:10:16,160
No, it's all good.

1701
02:10:16,160 --> 02:10:22,440
You know what, I want someone to try it at home so I can submit their story to the Darwin

1702
02:10:22,440 --> 02:10:24,880
Awards.

1703
02:10:24,880 --> 02:10:29,800
I don't get it because everybody's talking about this sensation of being blasted with

1704
02:10:29,800 --> 02:10:33,240
fire and all this stuff, you know, well you can feel the sensation of being blasted with

1705
02:10:33,240 --> 02:10:34,240
fire.

1706
02:10:34,240 --> 02:10:37,800
Okay, A, if you want to feel the sensation of being blasted with fire, become a firefighter.

1707
02:10:37,800 --> 02:10:43,240
B, if that's not for you or whatever, because you're wearing all these protective gear,

1708
02:10:43,240 --> 02:10:46,800
I mean I understand that there's that heat sensation or something, and I'm just knocking

1709
02:10:46,800 --> 02:10:49,440
on this I guess because it's not something I would ever really want to do.

1710
02:10:49,440 --> 02:10:51,000
I'm just not interested in it.

1711
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:56,200
I'm also not you know I just like I don't really want to visit central

1712
02:10:56,200 --> 02:11:00,200
Mexico so I'm not going to do it ever I don't really want to play pool yes in

1713
02:11:00,200 --> 02:11:04,760
the way go out and get laid there are more things better than fire being

1714
02:11:04,760 --> 02:11:13,000
blasted in your face like a good woman go get laid honestly that that's what I

1715
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:17,640
needed a woman co-design this game I think some prostitutes are cheaper than

1716
02:11:17,640 --> 02:11:21,640
I'm surprised the whole set up didn't blow up then.

1717
02:11:21,640 --> 02:11:25,640
Whoa! Whoa! Did you hear that joke you just made?

1718
02:11:25,640 --> 02:11:28,640
Excuse me? Repeat myself?

1719
02:11:28,640 --> 02:11:30,640
You should have listened in the first place.

1720
02:11:30,640 --> 02:11:32,640
No! No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1721
02:11:32,640 --> 02:11:38,640
If you want to hear that joke, you can tune into the rewinds that we have on DVR Freak for Yield.

1722
02:11:38,640 --> 02:11:44,640
No, no. We would be able to listen to it if someone would remember to upload it to DVR Freak's server.

1723
02:11:44,640 --> 02:11:49,040
I've been out a couple weeks, and we will get back in the swing of those very soon, so...

1724
02:11:49,040 --> 02:11:50,800
I think they're playing one from a month ago.

1725
02:11:50,800 --> 02:11:51,440
Yeah.

1726
02:11:51,440 --> 02:11:52,840
We'll be back in the swing of those.

1727
02:11:52,840 --> 02:11:56,400
It's almost the same show every week anyway.

1728
02:11:56,400 --> 02:11:58,320
No, nothing else is going on.

1729
02:11:58,320 --> 02:12:00,920
I'm gonna go ahead and repeat the joke because it wasn't my joke,

1730
02:12:00,920 --> 02:12:04,720
so I won't get in trouble for it, but I said, did the woman co-write it?

1731
02:12:04,720 --> 02:12:10,800
And then he said, well, I'm surprised that the whole thing isn't broken.

1732
02:12:10,800 --> 02:12:13,600
Actually, I said I'm surprised the whole thing didn't blow up.

1733
02:12:13,600 --> 02:12:14,600
Oh, sorry.

1734
02:12:15,900 --> 02:12:18,000
I'm going to strangle you with the mic cord now.

1735
02:12:19,600 --> 02:12:21,400
From now on, Loki will be a ghost.

1736
02:12:21,400 --> 02:12:23,100
He will be here in spirit only.

1737
02:12:24,100 --> 02:12:25,200
When I get around to it.

1738
02:12:27,700 --> 02:12:29,400
Anyways, no.

1739
02:12:30,300 --> 02:12:33,000
But see, at Burning Man, if it blew up, it'd be good.

1740
02:12:33,700 --> 02:12:34,200
I don't know.

1741
02:12:35,100 --> 02:12:36,100
Oh, man.

1742
02:12:36,600 --> 02:12:37,200
Why?

1743
02:12:38,100 --> 02:12:38,600
Hmm.

1744
02:12:39,100 --> 02:12:39,600
Why?

1745
02:12:39,800 --> 02:12:40,300
I don't know.

1746
02:12:40,300 --> 02:12:47,740
I just, I don't feel like you're really feeling the sensation of fire because you're wearing

1747
02:12:47,740 --> 02:12:52,940
a protective suit all over, so it's like it kind of takes away from that, it's like, feel

1748
02:12:52,940 --> 02:12:58,480
like what it's like to get shot, here's a bulletproof vest, you know?

1749
02:12:58,480 --> 02:13:03,020
And you know somebody's going to come up with this, like, dance, dance, you know, south

1750
02:13:03,020 --> 02:13:07,660
central where you've got to dodge the bullets that get shot at you if you miss a step.

1751
02:13:07,660 --> 02:13:10,660
I feel what it's like to get married and get kicked in the nuts.

1752
02:13:14,660 --> 02:13:15,660
I don't appreciate that.

1753
02:13:15,660 --> 02:13:17,660
Yeah, you two are the ones getting married in this next year.

1754
02:13:17,660 --> 02:13:19,660
I'm not, so whatever.

1755
02:13:19,660 --> 02:13:21,660
Alright.

1756
02:13:23,660 --> 02:13:25,660
We're going to go to a break.

1757
02:13:25,660 --> 02:13:27,660
When we come back from the break, more stuff.

1758
02:13:27,660 --> 02:13:29,660
Also, tonight's cage match winner,

1759
02:13:29,660 --> 02:13:31,660
I haven't even started looking at the votes yet,

1760
02:13:31,660 --> 02:13:35,660
so we'll get to all that when we come back after a quick break.

1761
02:13:35,660 --> 02:13:39,300
and I think I have the appropriate song to start us off this break

1762
02:13:39,300 --> 02:13:43,300
So we'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.

1763
02:14:09,300 --> 02:14:16,300
You've had the time to rest, which is coming to an end, and we start again.

1764
02:14:39,300 --> 02:14:41,300
You gotta give them CX a wish, you gotta let them go

1765
02:14:41,300 --> 02:14:43,300
One, two, three, fire!

1766
02:15:41,300 --> 02:16:03,040
I'd be here, I'd be here, I'd be here every day

1767
02:16:03,040 --> 02:16:07,040
I feel you, I feel you, I feel you everywhere

1768
02:16:07,040 --> 02:16:12,300
I feel you, I feel you, I say to you every day

1769
02:16:12,320 --> 02:16:14,660
I feel you, I feel you, I feel I'm anywhere now

1770
02:16:14,660 --> 02:16:18,360
I feel you, I feel you, I say to you everywhere all day

1771
02:16:18,360 --> 02:16:22,440
I feel you, I feel you, I feel you everywhere day

1772
02:16:22,440 --> 02:16:26,200
I feel you, I feel you, I say to you everywhere

1773
02:16:26,200 --> 02:16:30,060
I feel you, I feel you, I feel I'm anywhere now

1774
02:16:30,060 --> 02:16:34,060
I feel, I feel, I feel like I'm falling

1775
02:16:49,060 --> 02:16:53,060
I feel, I feel, I feel like I'm waiting

1776
02:16:53,060 --> 02:16:57,060
I feel, I feel, I say to you every day

1777
02:16:57,060 --> 02:17:19,460
Happy New Year!

1778
02:17:57,060 --> 02:18:08,600
oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh oh.

1779
02:18:08,600 --> 02:18:14,080
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh.

1780
02:18:14,080 --> 02:18:17,380
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1781
02:18:17,380 --> 02:18:20,380
I'm leaving you.

1782
02:18:20,380 --> 02:18:26,380
There's little love to find.

1783
02:18:26,380 --> 02:18:31,260
where my heart belongs.

1784
02:18:31,260 --> 02:18:38,380
I'm living through the midst of love

1785
02:18:38,380 --> 02:18:46,380
through by the day my heart belongs.

1786
02:18:46,380 --> 02:18:52,380
Living through the midst of love

1787
02:18:52,380 --> 02:18:59,380
To find a place my heart belongs

1788
02:18:59,380 --> 02:19:06,380
I'm living through the fear of love

1789
02:19:06,380 --> 02:19:17,380
To find the place where my heart belongs

1790
02:21:06,380 --> 02:21:10,380
Orange Lounge Radio, Bahmani Music, and more.

1791
02:21:10,380 --> 02:21:17,700
Howdy kids, welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, and in that break you heard some fire

1792
02:21:17,700 --> 02:21:25,220
from Disney's Rave, Happy Wedding from 2DX7 style, Lion Musashi with Thunder from 2DX8,

1793
02:21:25,220 --> 02:21:31,780
and DJ Doc with Pump It Up, I'm sorry, with Run To You from Pump It Up, I read it backwards,

1794
02:21:31,780 --> 02:21:32,780
sorry.

1795
02:21:32,780 --> 02:21:40,780
You wanna know what's funny? We did that at karaoke on the E3 trip.

1796
02:21:40,780 --> 02:21:41,780
What?

1797
02:21:41,780 --> 02:21:46,780
On the DDR Frank Moderator. Run to you, because we went to a Korean karaoke bar.

1798
02:21:46,780 --> 02:21:51,780
Oh, you went to a Korean karaoke bar. I remember the Korean arcade at Cyberbeat, but you didn't

1799
02:21:51,780 --> 02:21:52,780
go to Cyberbeat, did you?

1800
02:21:52,780 --> 02:21:59,780
No, but we went to a Korean karaoke place. And actually, I did a song off the Japanese

1801
02:21:59,780 --> 02:22:02,780
but it was only English, it was a bulla.

1802
02:22:02,780 --> 02:22:03,780
Ah.

1803
02:22:03,780 --> 02:22:09,620
I cannot forget at the Korean arcade, the cyber zone, I think it's called, I hope it's

1804
02:22:09,620 --> 02:22:13,020
still around, it was a cute little place, where they were having this tournament, they

1805
02:22:13,020 --> 02:22:16,060
had karaoke boost in the back, but it was the kind of thing where you'd lock yourself

1806
02:22:16,060 --> 02:22:19,580
in and you'd put in a couple tokens and you could sing a song, and I swear to God, Rice

1807
02:22:19,580 --> 02:22:22,840
Princess and I were in there the entire tournament, we probably missed the whole tournament thanks

1808
02:22:22,840 --> 02:22:24,100
to those karaoke rooms.

1809
02:22:24,100 --> 02:22:27,500
I was singing Cyndi Lauper, and I was singing, you know, just everything, everything.

1810
02:22:27,500 --> 02:22:31,620
it was fine. And it would grade you when you were done, which I thought was kind of weird.

1811
02:22:31,620 --> 02:22:35,860
Well, yeah, but that's like almost typical of just about every other karaoke thing I've

1812
02:22:35,860 --> 02:22:38,980
done except for the ones like where we normally go to karaoke.

1813
02:22:38,980 --> 02:22:44,660
Yeah. Anyway, I actually wanted to mention something about Pump It Up. We actually have

1814
02:22:44,660 --> 02:22:51,140
a little bit of an exclusive here. So we have a tip from our buddy Maple, and Maple, he's

1815
02:22:51,140 --> 02:22:57,460
sharing this with us so that we can tell you guys that Banya with a song, and I'm gonna

1816
02:22:57,460 --> 02:22:59,900
I'm gonna fuck up the pronunciation of this.

1817
02:22:59,900 --> 02:23:04,900
Niceance, N-A-I-S-S-A-N-C-E, Niceance, Niceance, I don't know.

1818
02:23:05,580 --> 02:23:06,420
Niceance.

1819
02:23:06,420 --> 02:23:07,580
Niceance.

1820
02:23:07,580 --> 02:23:12,020
This song will actually be unlocked in survival mode.

1821
02:23:12,020 --> 02:23:15,180
In Pump It Up, so that's not on any of the song lists

1822
02:23:15,180 --> 02:23:18,740
that are already out there, so go figure.

1823
02:23:18,740 --> 02:23:20,460
If you didn't know, the way that Pump It Up,

1824
02:23:20,460 --> 02:23:22,820
the home version works, it's got like different modes.

1825
02:23:22,820 --> 02:23:25,460
Home mode has no life bars in it.

1826
02:23:25,460 --> 02:23:31,440
The arcade mode is like the arcade, but survival mode, when your life bar runs out, you lose.

1827
02:23:31,440 --> 02:23:34,720
So there's these different modes you can play that kind of alter the life mode, and by playing

1828
02:23:34,720 --> 02:23:36,820
the right way, you will get this new Bonnie song.

1829
02:23:36,820 --> 02:23:42,220
You know what, if I was any good at Pump It Up, I think I would dig the one that doesn't

1830
02:23:42,220 --> 02:23:43,220
have a life bar.

1831
02:23:43,220 --> 02:23:44,220
Yeah.

1832
02:23:44,220 --> 02:23:48,260
I'm gonna, um, I'm gonna, uh, pick up this game.

1833
02:23:48,260 --> 02:23:53,380
Even though I'm not, like, huge on Pump It Up, I just think such diversity in the game.

1834
02:23:53,380 --> 02:23:57,380
I'm hopeful, even though Mad Catz is publishing it, I'm very hopeful about the game.

1835
02:23:57,380 --> 02:24:01,380
It looks like it's going to be pretty good, so I'm definitely going to pick it up.

1836
02:24:01,380 --> 02:24:05,380
Naysons is how you pronounce that, by the way. Thank you, kids in chat.

1837
02:24:05,380 --> 02:24:10,380
Look soon to our site. We're going to have some videos of this game in progress.

1838
02:24:10,380 --> 02:24:17,380
So, we'll have that sometime in the next week. So, those of you guys looking forward to, pump it up in the U.S.

1839
02:24:17,380 --> 02:24:20,380
Something else I wanted to share with you guys, an anonymous tip from the chat room.

1840
02:24:20,380 --> 02:24:24,400
not so much an anonymous tip, actually. This came to us from, I believe Dark Knight sent

1841
02:24:24,400 --> 02:24:29,720
this over to me, and if I mess that up, I'm very sorry. This is a link on IGN.com, actually,

1842
02:24:29,720 --> 02:24:37,000
that talks about a preview for a new Nintendo DS music game from the people that made Guitar

1843
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:45,240
Man. Osutake Oondan. Let me see, let me think of it. Excuse me, it's in the laptop. Yeah,

1844
02:24:45,240 --> 02:24:47,240
Yeah, I saw that one. It's weird-looking.

1845
02:24:47,240 --> 02:24:49,240
Well, how so, Loki?

1846
02:24:49,240 --> 02:24:51,240
Um, it looks like...

1847
02:24:51,240 --> 02:24:53,240
Tatakai...Tatakai means fight.

1848
02:24:53,240 --> 02:24:58,240
Um, Olendan, I'm not quite sure, but it means, hey, fight something.

1849
02:24:58,240 --> 02:24:59,240
Alright.

1850
02:24:59,240 --> 02:25:03,240
It looked funny because there's like these three guys dancing and stuff,

1851
02:25:03,240 --> 02:25:07,240
and there's this guy that looks like yelling at them, and I don't really know what that was.

1852
02:25:07,240 --> 02:25:10,240
I was just based off the pictures that I saw in there.

1853
02:25:10,240 --> 02:25:12,240
Hmm interesting

1854
02:25:12,280 --> 02:25:20,800
Basically, it involves three like soldier type guys that are going around and around the town and they they motivate people with manly poses

1855
02:25:20,800 --> 02:25:26,020
but it's up to the player to control just how well that they can motivate so it's kind of like a

1856
02:25:26,440 --> 02:25:30,360
Follow the pattern type challenge and it matches the beat of the song that's being played of course

1857
02:25:31,040 --> 02:25:37,120
Using the touchscreen. Oh, why am I thinking of like the super sentai pose?

1858
02:25:37,120 --> 02:25:41,520
those things that they do for every time they speak.

1859
02:25:41,520 --> 02:25:45,120
During the song, a series of numbered circles pop up on screen as the player's tasked to

1860
02:25:45,120 --> 02:25:47,840
tap the circle to the rhythm of the song.

1861
02:25:47,840 --> 02:25:51,760
Now the game offers a little bit of help by providing a ring around each circle as they

1862
02:25:51,760 --> 02:25:56,400
appear, and when the ring matches the circumference of the beat circle, that's the exact moment

1863
02:25:56,400 --> 02:25:57,600
it needs to be tapped.

1864
02:25:57,600 --> 02:26:01,320
I think Technic Beat kind of does something a little similar there, so...

1865
02:26:01,320 --> 02:26:03,080
Technic Beat is confusing.

1866
02:26:03,080 --> 02:26:06,560
Yeah, but this song sounds like it's just the tap on the right circle, so that should

1867
02:26:06,560 --> 02:26:11,800
be interesting there. But that's not it. There's also pathways in the game where you

1868
02:26:11,800 --> 02:26:17,160
don't just tap. They're a little bit longer of a beat. You have to tap and drag your stylus

1869
02:26:17,160 --> 02:26:23,040
to the beat. It's like a virtual volleyball, one end of the path to another and back again.

1870
02:26:23,040 --> 02:26:27,000
So that's kind of the guitar man-ish part of it. That should be very interesting.

1871
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:32,720
Rob, say that last word for me. O-U-E-N-D-A-N. O-U-E-N-D-A-N, yes.

1872
02:26:32,720 --> 02:26:34,120
Okay, I'm gonna see what that means.

1873
02:26:34,120 --> 02:26:35,120
Alright.

1874
02:26:35,120 --> 02:26:37,120
Okay.

1875
02:26:37,120 --> 02:26:40,620
Alright, uh, let's get to tonight's cage match winner, boys and girls.

1876
02:26:40,620 --> 02:26:42,120
I know you've been waiting a while to hear it.

1877
02:26:42,120 --> 02:26:45,420
Tonight's cage match winner was won by one vote.

1878
02:26:45,420 --> 02:26:48,220
And I have to say tonight, kids, not a lot of votes tonight.

1879
02:26:48,220 --> 02:26:51,020
I'm very pissed at your apathy.

1880
02:26:51,020 --> 02:26:52,720
But for those of you guys that did vote, thank you.

1881
02:26:52,720 --> 02:26:53,720
They're being too emo.

1882
02:26:53,720 --> 02:26:54,720
Yeah, I guess so.

1883
02:26:54,720 --> 02:26:57,220
Maybe they were too wrapped up in the, uh, emo chick song.

1884
02:26:57,220 --> 02:26:59,020
Unfortunately, that's not the song that won tonight.

1885
02:26:59,020 --> 02:27:02,220
The song that won tonight was...

1886
02:27:02,220 --> 02:27:07,220
Onyx by Cold Storage with one vote over MC Chris.

1887
02:27:07,220 --> 02:27:08,220
Sadness.

1888
02:27:08,220 --> 02:27:10,220
Hooray for generic.

1889
02:27:10,220 --> 02:27:13,220
He had on the picket song next week.

1890
02:27:13,220 --> 02:27:16,220
Rub it in. Rub it in.

1891
02:27:16,220 --> 02:27:21,220
To those of you guys who didn't vote, poop on you.

1892
02:27:21,220 --> 02:27:27,220
I think going into that, though, I think that it's highly appropriate to have, you know...

1893
02:27:27,220 --> 02:27:29,220
Oh, some ranting time?

1894
02:27:29,220 --> 02:27:30,220
Yes, some ranting time.

1895
02:27:30,220 --> 02:27:41,220
I agree. I'm ready to be pissed off. I'm ready to do a little ranting. So Chat Room, if you're ready to do some ranting too, it's that time of the show, boys and girls, where we get into the FUs of the week.

1896
02:27:41,220 --> 02:27:49,220
Now, you know what's interesting, DarkSakura? I know you put this in the pre-show folder, and I know you didn't intend for this to be your new FU theme.

1897
02:27:49,220 --> 02:27:51,220
What?

1898
02:27:51,220 --> 02:27:54,220
I've not put that in there for you since you never seem to be able to find it.

1899
02:27:54,220 --> 02:27:55,220
Thank you. I appreciate that.

1900
02:27:55,220 --> 02:27:57,220
We're going to have to do this next week.

1901
02:27:57,220 --> 02:28:02,220
I have some funny music that you can use for game show stuff.

1902
02:28:02,220 --> 02:28:04,220
I put it on my card, especially for you guys.

1903
02:28:04,220 --> 02:28:06,220
I'm sorry, this isn't about ranting.

1904
02:28:06,220 --> 02:28:08,220
But it's funny!

1905
02:28:08,220 --> 02:28:11,220
I want that as my F.U. music because it's so weird.

1906
02:28:11,220 --> 02:28:12,220
Well, you get Menomina on one.

1907
02:28:12,220 --> 02:28:13,220
By the way.

1908
02:28:13,220 --> 02:28:14,220
Oh, fine.

1909
02:28:14,220 --> 02:28:17,220
Olendan means something to the effect of cheering party.

1910
02:28:17,220 --> 02:28:19,220
Or cheering gang or posing gang.

1911
02:28:19,220 --> 02:28:22,220
Well, that makes sense if they're like a motivational group that runs around.

1912
02:28:22,220 --> 02:28:25,220
Yeah, so it's like, hey, fight! Cheering party!

1913
02:28:25,220 --> 02:28:26,220
Okay.

1914
02:28:26,220 --> 02:28:30,220
Fight, kill, blood makes grass grow. Fight, kill, blood makes grass grow.

1915
02:28:30,220 --> 02:28:36,220
Actually, that used to be our homecoming chant every year because our, uh, rival school for homecoming was McGill.

1916
02:28:36,220 --> 02:28:39,220
So it was kill McGill, blood makes the grass grow.

1917
02:28:39,220 --> 02:28:42,220
This used to be our cheer.

1918
02:28:42,220 --> 02:28:45,220
And this kind of ties into the next segment here, so I'll kick it off with a little cheer.

1919
02:28:45,220 --> 02:28:47,220
I'm gonna kick off tonight's FUs with a little cheer.

1920
02:28:47,220 --> 02:28:48,220
You're gonna be our cheerleader!

1921
02:28:48,220 --> 02:28:49,220
Yes, I am. Okay, ready?

1922
02:28:49,220 --> 02:28:50,220
Has it already been brought in?

1923
02:28:50,220 --> 02:28:57,560
yes so I'm broadening it right now okay give me a cue cue give me a cue cue give

that spell 3b you're retarded why are we doing this why was the band here okay

1927
02:29:17,640 --> 02:29:20,640
Okay, why are we doing the 4Q of the week?

1928
02:29:20,640 --> 02:29:23,640
Because we're full of emo.

1929
02:29:31,640 --> 02:29:35,640
My first F.U. goes to people who like generic crap.

1930
02:29:35,640 --> 02:29:45,080
My second F.U. of the week goes towards just being given random assignments at work and

1931
02:29:45,080 --> 02:29:50,040
then having to go back and do everybody else's stuff because certain people decided not to

1932
02:29:50,040 --> 02:29:55,120
come into work that day and aren't going to be in the next week, so I get to do it again.

1933
02:29:55,120 --> 02:29:56,120
Yay!

1934
02:29:56,120 --> 02:30:03,720
F.U. goes toward having to basically do a lot of the wedding crap on my own, although

1935
02:30:03,720 --> 02:30:08,040
I've been getting a bit more support as of late. Well, it's not really that I'm doing

1936
02:30:08,040 --> 02:30:11,320
it on my own, it's just that there's certain things about it that are more important to

1937
02:30:11,320 --> 02:30:16,200
me than they are to the other party in my wedding.

1938
02:30:16,200 --> 02:30:18,440
You guys should do a reality show about my wedding.

1939
02:30:18,440 --> 02:30:28,440
No! Hell no, okay? Hell no. This is close enough to reality. More like unreality. Another

1940
02:30:58,440 --> 02:31:07,680
much longer to wait. Something for the podcast, sorry. I just had a tiny little fanboy orgasm

1941
02:31:07,680 --> 02:31:14,840
though. F.U. goes to Loki for showing Rob Krabs you're my F.U. Excuse me, it's my moment,

1942
02:31:14,840 --> 02:31:23,560
okay. Animal Crossing DS needs to be out like now. Dude, when's that supposed to be out?

1943
02:31:23,560 --> 02:31:24,560
November.

1944
02:31:24,560 --> 02:31:25,560
Haha.

1945
02:31:25,560 --> 02:31:26,560
Aww, fuck them.

1946
02:31:26,560 --> 02:31:36,280
F you to not being able to register for my wedding because, you know, I want to register

1947
02:31:36,280 --> 02:31:40,840
and all this because, you know, I don't care what people say about, you know, don't send

1948
02:31:40,840 --> 02:31:41,840
me gifts.

1949
02:31:41,840 --> 02:31:45,520
When you get married, people feel obligated to give you a present, you know, it's just

1950
02:31:45,520 --> 02:31:46,520
how things are.

1951
02:31:46,520 --> 02:31:50,960
So, I want Amazon gift certificates and that's it.

1952
02:31:50,960 --> 02:31:53,080
How many toasters do you want, seriously?

1953
02:31:53,080 --> 02:31:54,080
You don't eat bread.

1954
02:31:54,080 --> 02:31:55,080
Exactly.

1955
02:31:55,080 --> 02:31:57,080
I don't fucking need a toaster.

1956
02:31:57,080 --> 02:31:58,080
So, yeah.

1957
02:31:58,080 --> 02:32:03,800
Um, as to the traditional ideas of having to give people, like, household goods for

1958
02:32:03,800 --> 02:32:05,880
their wedding, just give me an Amazon gift certificate.

1959
02:32:05,880 --> 02:32:06,880
I'll be happy.

1960
02:32:06,880 --> 02:32:08,880
Um, that's it.

1961
02:32:08,880 --> 02:32:09,880
Alright.

1962
02:32:09,880 --> 02:32:14,740
Let Dark Sakura save up so she can buy many copies of the Kama Sutra.

1963
02:32:14,740 --> 02:32:15,740
I don't need that.

1964
02:32:15,740 --> 02:32:18,900
Oh, why would she need many copies of it?

1965
02:32:18,900 --> 02:32:21,220
You know, just to have in various rooms at the house.

1966
02:32:21,220 --> 02:32:23,220
Loki's turn.

1967
02:32:51,220 --> 02:32:57,220
Teacopter 2, which was a waste of my time. Don't import that game, ever. It looks strange, but not strange enough.

1968
02:32:57,220 --> 02:33:06,220
And, um, yeah, and also fuck you too, that stupid, um, Jack, whatever his name is. I don't even want to, you know.

1969
02:33:06,220 --> 02:33:07,220
Jack Thompson?

1970
02:33:07,220 --> 02:33:08,220
Jack Thompson!

1971
02:33:08,220 --> 02:33:09,220
The idiot?

1972
02:33:09,220 --> 02:33:10,220
Eh, friggin' idiot.

1973
02:33:10,220 --> 02:33:13,220
Oh, no, no, no. I'm gonna bring up later on about VGCats.

1974
02:33:13,220 --> 02:33:23,220
But he, you know, he just has to go out there and just, you know, perpetuate the let's not blame the parents for our kids' problems, let's blame someone else stereotype.

1975
02:33:23,220 --> 02:33:32,220
So anyways, to hell with him. I hope he dies. In some ironic way that has to do with video games. I'm done.

1976
02:33:32,220 --> 02:33:43,220
kostjamrh And FU'd a Nintendo for not having Animal Crossing DS out like now.

1977
02:34:02,220 --> 02:34:06,220
But my aim's improving.

1978
02:34:06,220 --> 02:34:10,220
You owe me rent on that, you know?

1979
02:34:10,220 --> 02:34:14,220
I used to have that bumper sticker on my car like years ago when I really hated my ex. We're friends now.

1980
02:34:14,220 --> 02:34:18,220
Anyway, none of that matters.

1981
02:34:18,220 --> 02:34:22,220
I don't know, just a nephew to the fact that I'm

1982
02:34:22,220 --> 02:34:26,220
a nephew to the fact that I've got a lot of drama going on

1983
02:34:26,220 --> 02:34:30,220
in other places that don't have to do with the show or anything, but I can't really

1984
02:34:30,220 --> 02:34:40,140
on air either so just nephew to all that drama going on there um and an fu2 um an fu2 um

1985
02:34:40,140 --> 02:34:43,640

02:34:43,640 --> 02:34:49,240

1988
02:34:54,560 --> 02:34:58,560
Find it to download to the Mighty Mosh and Emo Rangers theme.

1989
02:35:24,560 --> 02:35:27,300
And I heard it's going to jump to $3 tomorrow or the next day.

1990
02:35:27,300 --> 02:35:30,240
Do I have a justifiable reason for not wanting to drive now?

1991
02:35:30,240 --> 02:35:35,380
Fuck cage match 2 and I want a copy of Geek now.

1992
02:35:35,380 --> 02:35:39,780
Legend of Zaku says F you to the Iraqi insurgent who capped one of my school's student-soldier

1993
02:35:39,780 --> 02:35:41,340
to death last Sunday.

1994
02:35:41,340 --> 02:35:44,400
And F you to President Bush for making that situation possible.

1995
02:35:44,400 --> 02:35:47,300
F you to all the thunderstorms we've been having tonight, thus taking out the power

1996
02:35:47,300 --> 02:35:48,680
in my house for a little bit.

1997
02:35:48,680 --> 02:35:52,560
And F you to my cable provider Cablevision for providing shitty digital cable that gives

1998
02:35:52,560 --> 02:35:59,400
channels with piss-poor lag and pixelation. Tomo-kun says fuck my iTunes library for corrupting

1999
02:35:59,400 --> 02:36:05,080
itself and all but one song not recovering. The acapella to feel good Inc. was the song

2000
02:36:05,080 --> 02:36:11,560
that got saved. You saved it? Send that to me please. Chamara says F you to not having

2001
02:36:11,560 --> 02:36:19,440
enough money to buy cool stuff like ATHF DVDs and Napalm. Sacarina says F you to Jack Thompson

2002
02:36:19,440 --> 02:36:25,920
for being the biggest fucktard on earth and causing havoc worldwide.

2003
02:36:25,920 --> 02:36:29,880
Dark Knight says my F.U. goes to my job for driving me insane, another to being broke

2004
02:36:29,880 --> 02:36:36,040
and finally to gas prices, this has gone too damn far.

2005
02:36:36,040 --> 02:36:41,000
Dirty Thief says F.U. to my damn boss for giving me six extra hours of work, F.U. to

2006
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:45,880
traffic thunderstorms and other shit that ruins my Sunday night including these damn

Pennsylvania oh it's the saddest thing ever and he almost had a heart attack

2010
02:36:57,640 --> 02:37:02,480
don't don't hit animals on the road didn't try hard enough dark Tetsuya

2013
02:37:14,480 --> 02:37:21,480
I'm being assisted with that and I will be happy to share.

2014
02:37:44,480 --> 02:37:48,920
large contingent from some site? A few of the people from the Gorillaz unofficial chats

2015
02:37:48,920 --> 02:37:55,160
listening in. Hi guys! Super! Thank you for listening in. We have Bexar and Ross and I'm

2016
02:37:55,160 --> 02:37:59,360
trying to remember who else is listening but if I don't remember, hi! You get a big shout

2017
02:37:59,360 --> 02:38:06,200
out from me. We like it when new people listen. I'm going to tip the orange lounge hat by

2018
02:38:06,200 --> 02:38:12,540
just giving a little nod with the song here. We'll dance like they do in the iPod commercials

2019
02:38:12,540 --> 02:38:16,540
here with the shadows and everything. I'd rather not dance like they do in the iPad commercial.

2020
02:38:16,540 --> 02:38:20,540
Ooh, you can just keep playing this for me.

2021
02:38:20,540 --> 02:38:24,540
Okay, that's all you get. Sorry.

2022
02:38:24,540 --> 02:38:28,540
You know what, though, that makes me think of this. I saw

2023
02:38:28,540 --> 02:38:32,540
this in the... I was randomly having lunch in Phoenix yesterday, right?

2024
02:38:32,540 --> 02:38:36,540
Jason took me to this Chinese restaurant, and we were watching commercials

2025
02:38:36,540 --> 02:38:40,540
on TV, and I saw this one that looked like it was parodying

2026
02:38:40,540 --> 02:38:45,720
that commercial with the Feel Good Inc. and the iPod Shadow Dancers, right?

2027
02:38:45,720 --> 02:38:50,200
But it was children doing the shadow dancing, and we were like, what the hell is this?

2028
02:38:50,200 --> 02:38:54,820
And it turns out it was actually for like a Kidz Bop CD, but no, it gets better.

2029
02:38:54,820 --> 02:38:59,860
It was actually an all Christian Kidz Bop version.

2030
02:38:59,860 --> 02:39:03,860
I don't remember what it was called, it's like, wow, wow, that's inspiration or something

2031
02:39:03,860 --> 02:39:05,660
like that, Kidz Inspiration or something.

2032
02:39:05,660 --> 02:39:12,660
It was, it was Kidz Bop, but all God music, and it was Jesus telling you to copy, or to

2033
02:39:13,860 --> 02:39:17,180
copyright infringement. Yes, I thought Thou Shalt Not Steal was one

2034
02:39:17,180 --> 02:39:23,340
of the, uh, Thou Shalt Not Steal copyrights. You know, we need to actually check the original

2035
02:39:23,340 --> 02:39:28,340
translation to see what this says. Actually, point of order, in case you didn't know, it's

2036
02:39:28,340 --> 02:39:32,660
the, uh, original translations, uh, for, uh, Thou Shalt Not Kill is actually Thou Shalt

2037
02:39:32,660 --> 02:39:33,660
not commit murder.

2038
02:39:33,660 --> 02:39:34,660
Interesting.

2039
02:39:34,660 --> 02:39:35,660
Yes.

2040
02:39:35,660 --> 02:39:42,500
See, I love how much crap they changed.

2041
02:39:42,500 --> 02:39:44,660
You know you're opening a whole can of worms when you bring up religion.

2042
02:39:44,660 --> 02:39:47,620
I'm not gonna bring, I'm not gonna open up the religion for the worm.

2043
02:39:47,620 --> 02:39:52,740
My God, I mean, we get hate mail when Loki bashes on Mac, so we don't wanna get religion.

2044
02:39:52,740 --> 02:39:55,180
And you know what, I usually forward all that over to his email.

2045
02:39:55,180 --> 02:39:56,180
Oh, good.

2046
02:39:56,180 --> 02:39:57,660
I don't get any hate mail.

2047
02:39:57,660 --> 02:39:58,660
Exactly.

2048
02:39:58,660 --> 02:40:01,220
Although I did share the funny Mac one with you.

2049
02:40:01,220 --> 02:40:03,580
Yeah, whatever.

2050
02:40:03,580 --> 02:40:04,820
That one was stupid.

2051
02:40:04,820 --> 02:40:05,700
All right.

2052
02:40:05,700 --> 02:40:06,900
We're going to go to a quick break.

2053
02:40:06,900 --> 02:40:08,780
Boys and girls, when we come back, we're going to do a

2054
02:40:08,780 --> 02:40:10,840
little bit of Ask Orange Lounge.

2055
02:40:10,840 --> 02:40:14,420
And I just came back from a trip, and we were kind of off

2056
02:40:14,420 --> 02:40:16,300
last week, except for, well, there was the

2057
02:40:16,300 --> 02:40:17,300
music show going on.

2058
02:40:17,300 --> 02:40:20,500
But we haven't had a chance to do some Ask Orange Lounge in

2059
02:40:20,500 --> 02:40:21,020
a little while.

2060
02:40:21,020 --> 02:40:24,260
So here's your chance to ask us something.

2061
02:40:24,260 --> 02:40:25,500
Anything you want.

2062
02:40:25,500 --> 02:40:28,300
So we're going to go just to some more music potpourri.

2063
02:40:28,300 --> 02:40:30,480
I'll probably do another In the Groove song this break for

2064
02:40:30,480 --> 02:40:35,480
you folks that are into that and I know there's a lot of folks out there that

2065
02:40:35,480 --> 02:40:40,000
are into this song we haven't played it in a long time so like it or not here's

2066
02:40:40,000 --> 02:40:43,240
some cartoon heroes we'll be back after this one more orange lounge radio and

2067
02:40:43,240 --> 02:40:50,240
Ask Orange Lounge to send your questions in to Skye, be of type of message.

2068
02:41:13,240 --> 02:41:18,240
We do the things you want to see, brain by brain, to the X-ray

2069
02:41:18,240 --> 02:41:24,240
Our friends are so unreasonable, they do the unpredictable

2070
02:41:24,240 --> 02:41:29,240
I doubt a lie to speak and say what we do and what we can't wait to do

2071
02:41:29,240 --> 02:41:34,240
Let's go down north and far away, do it on the little bay

2072
02:41:34,240 --> 02:41:40,240
Brain by brain to the X-ray, one by one we made it far

2073
02:41:40,240 --> 02:41:46,240
We are the time to be heroes of the world We are the hope to find a man for the robot

2074
02:41:46,240 --> 02:41:51,240
He's crazy by your back, crazy mind Oh no, don't wanna let him out, he's a vampire

2075
02:41:51,240 --> 02:41:57,240
Get your fire back, we're running from the end We're time to run to the fire

2076
02:41:57,240 --> 02:42:03,240
We've got a superman, we've got a metal man We're gonna shoot, we're gonna shoot, we're gonna fire

2077
02:42:27,240 --> 02:42:29,240
Oh

2078
02:45:27,240 --> 02:45:31,240
To the end, nothing to change my world

2079
02:45:31,240 --> 02:45:33,240
The end you'll love

2080
02:45:45,240 --> 02:45:48,240
I wanna stay with you tonight

2081
02:45:48,240 --> 02:45:51,240
Baby, baby, I need you every time

2082
02:45:51,240 --> 02:45:54,240
Love is on me and I wanna stay

2083
02:45:54,240 --> 02:45:58,240
Give me baby and tell me you are my love

2084
02:45:58,240 --> 02:46:01,240
And now you give me all your love

2085
02:46:01,240 --> 02:46:04,240
And feel some pride for me, let's get it on

2086
02:46:04,240 --> 02:46:09,240
I love you like you are baby, now I give you my heart

2087
02:46:10,240 --> 02:46:13,240
Call me old man, Juliet

2088
02:46:13,240 --> 02:46:15,240
Forever and together

2089
02:46:15,240 --> 02:46:16,240
I love you babe

2090
02:46:16,240 --> 02:46:19,240
Call me old man, Juliet

2091
02:46:19,240 --> 02:46:22,240
Gonna tell us not to feel so true

2092
02:46:22,240 --> 02:46:28,240
Roll me your hand, do me aye, forever and together

2093
02:46:28,240 --> 02:46:32,240
I love you babe, roll me your hand, do me aye

2094
02:46:32,240 --> 02:46:37,240
Nothing can change my world, me and you, love

2095
02:47:02,240 --> 02:47:09,240
I just made that connection. I think the guy wanted to hear the Romeo and Juliet song from

2096
02:47:10,240 --> 02:47:17,240
In The Groove and I played that one instead. Whoops! Boy, did I fuck that one up. I don't

2097
02:47:17,240 --> 02:47:28,040
I fucked that one up. I don't care. I don't care. I don't care. Suck it. Alright. In that

2098
02:47:28,040 --> 02:47:34,720
break you also heard cartoon heroes. I just thought he made a sad typo. It didn't connect

2099
02:47:34,720 --> 02:47:43,360
to my mind at first. It's not my fault these people can't be unique and come up with unique

2100
02:47:43,360 --> 02:47:47,360
titles for their songs

2101
02:47:47,360 --> 02:47:50,000
max unlimited in that break to

2102
02:47:50,000 --> 02:47:53,860
minimum and as a minimally in a minimal i think it's minimally and then the

2103
02:47:53,860 --> 02:47:55,120
molly yeah

2104
02:47:55,120 --> 02:47:57,840
yeah uh... by many something many something

2105
02:47:57,840 --> 02:48:01,560
and in romeo julieto by lolita

2106
02:48:01,560 --> 02:48:05,420
you know if you know you know i detroitian or deep no detroit yet to

2107
02:48:05,420 --> 02:48:06,560
come to my end

2108
02:48:06,560 --> 02:48:09,280
detroit and that's a cool name

2109
02:48:09,280 --> 02:48:16,280
Here's a little clip of the other Romeo and Juliet song.

2110
02:48:19,740 --> 02:48:23,640
You know I actually do like this Romeo and Juliet better too. Why didn't I think of this at first?

2111
02:48:23,640 --> 02:48:28,240
I don't know. I'm just in a paramode tonight or something.

2112
02:48:28,240 --> 02:48:31,320
I don't know. I can't believe I did that.

2113
02:48:31,320 --> 02:48:35,800
Next time kids specify the artist if there's more than one song by the name

2114
02:48:35,800 --> 02:48:37,520
or I might fuck your request up.

2115
02:48:37,520 --> 02:48:48,080
I bet that guy's not happy, though, whose request I fucked up, but, you know, I'm human.

2116
02:48:48,080 --> 02:48:49,080
What can I say?

2117
02:48:49,080 --> 02:48:52,040
Yeah, the other one, it was Tomokun requested it.

2118
02:48:52,040 --> 02:48:53,040
I know.

2119
02:48:53,040 --> 02:48:54,040
I'm sorry, Tomokun.

2120
02:48:54,040 --> 02:48:57,600
And he specifically spelled it a different way.

2121
02:48:57,600 --> 02:48:59,040
It didn't click for me at first.

2122
02:48:59,040 --> 02:49:00,040
I'm sorry.

2123
02:49:00,040 --> 02:49:01,440
Ross doesn't care about our listeners.

2124
02:49:01,440 --> 02:49:02,440
You know what?

2125
02:49:02,440 --> 02:49:03,440
You found me out.

2126
02:49:03,440 --> 02:49:06,960
It's just because In the Groove's forgettable, that's all.

2127
02:49:06,960 --> 02:49:11,240
I was waiting for Loki to jump in there with some slamming in the groove comment.

2128
02:49:11,240 --> 02:49:14,100
You snubbed my fanboy.

2129
02:49:14,100 --> 02:49:15,240
I'm sorry.

2130
02:49:15,240 --> 02:49:19,240
Dude, I may have snubbed your fanboy, but I didn't snub your stalker. I've been reading DDR Freak lately, and that's...

2131
02:49:19,240 --> 02:49:25,760
Okay, my stalker is scary. Oh my god. Oh my god. No, no, no, no, no, no.

2132
02:49:25,760 --> 02:49:27,920
This Blair is King guy.

2133
02:49:27,920 --> 02:49:28,800
Yeah.

2134
02:49:28,800 --> 02:49:33,700
Doc Sacra, I watched you leave in your car today.

2135
02:49:33,700 --> 02:49:38,300
Are you going to lock another thread today?

2136
02:49:38,300 --> 02:49:42,100
I mean, I really do want to thank...

2137
02:49:42,100 --> 02:49:47,820
Iguana Girl is my best friend, and she will stick up for me as needs be, and she called

2138
02:49:47,820 --> 02:49:49,820
him out for me.

2139
02:49:49,820 --> 02:49:53,140
And I was like, okay, now I hope he doesn't do anything else.

2140
02:49:53,140 --> 02:50:01,620
I've sort of been sticking to my assigned forums over on imaging and the UK forum and

2141
02:50:01,620 --> 02:50:03,020
the moderator forum.

2142
02:50:03,020 --> 02:50:08,020
and sometimes sneaking into random chat, so I've been good at avoiding him on the board,

2143
02:50:08,020 --> 02:50:14,460
but it's like I still hear about things, so it's, ugh! Creepy! See, Tomo-kun is not creepy.

2144
02:50:14,460 --> 02:50:18,500
Tomo-kun is fanboy. Fanboy is cool. Creepy stalker is not cool.

2145
02:50:18,500 --> 02:50:22,660
Private messages with pictures of... He sends me private messages saying, you should probably

2146
02:50:22,660 --> 02:50:25,860
warn this person. You should probably warn this person. You should watch this thread.

2147
02:50:25,860 --> 02:50:29,540
I send those to Iguana Girl and sometimes you, and I'm not stalking you guys.

2148
02:50:29,540 --> 02:50:35,540
I know, but he's like all the time doing it, and I'm like, oh my god, you're a freak.

2149
02:50:35,540 --> 02:50:36,540
No way he is, he's a kid's ass.

2150
02:50:36,540 --> 02:50:39,540
This poor guy's probably listening, and you're breaking his heart.

2151
02:50:39,540 --> 02:50:40,540
I hope so!

2152
02:50:40,540 --> 02:50:41,540
You're breaking his heart.

2153
02:50:41,540 --> 02:50:44,540
I'm giving him a solid dose of reality, it's good.

2154
02:50:44,540 --> 02:50:46,540
He sounds like a brown-noser to me.

2155
02:50:46,540 --> 02:50:47,540
Good for the soul.

2156
02:50:47,540 --> 02:50:49,540
Yeah, it actually does sound kind of like he's trying to kiss my ass.

2157
02:50:49,540 --> 02:50:51,540
He just wants to be a mod, is that so wrong?

2158
02:50:51,540 --> 02:50:53,540
Isn't that what all the kids want, is DDR Free Pod Hatership?

2159
02:50:53,540 --> 02:50:55,540
Yeah, he wants to be a mod.

2160
02:50:55,540 --> 02:50:56,540
He wants to be a mod.

2161
02:50:56,540 --> 02:50:59,820
Being a moderator on DDR Freak is not all roses and sunshine.

2162
02:50:59,820 --> 02:51:01,260
So he can get closer to you.

2163
02:51:01,260 --> 02:51:03,260
Doesn't he know that...

2164
02:51:03,260 --> 02:51:05,500
Don't say stuff like that! You're freaking me out!

2165
02:51:05,500 --> 02:51:11,040
Doesn't he know that the mods on DDR Freak are pointed by God and you can't obviously

2166
02:51:11,040 --> 02:51:14,060
become one unless you know you have like a miracle?

2167
02:51:14,060 --> 02:51:16,720
Actually, if you want to know, we sort of vote on you, moderators.

2168
02:51:16,720 --> 02:51:19,420
You have to have three miracles.

2169
02:51:19,420 --> 02:51:20,780
Yes.

2170
02:51:20,780 --> 02:51:25,740
And then after that we part the Dead Sea and...

2171
02:51:25,740 --> 02:51:29,740
You know, spit nails, shit ice cream, that kind of thing.

2172
02:51:29,740 --> 02:51:32,740
Alright kids, we gotta get to the next segment. You know it, you love it.

2173
02:51:37,740 --> 02:51:40,740
Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid questions.

2174
02:51:40,740 --> 02:51:44,740
What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?

2175
02:51:44,740 --> 02:51:48,740
I think the first question is from BlairIsTheKing

2176
02:51:48,740 --> 02:51:51,740
and the question he has this week is, Dark Sakura, will you marry me?

2177
02:51:51,740 --> 02:51:59,700
I'm proud of myself for that one.

2178
02:51:59,700 --> 02:52:02,380
I made that up.

2179
02:52:02,380 --> 02:52:03,820
I should be on Whose Line Is It Anyway?

2180
02:52:03,820 --> 02:52:07,980
RENEE has two queries, one for Loki.

2181
02:52:07,980 --> 02:52:08,980
One for Loki.

2182
02:52:08,980 --> 02:52:13,780
Since he's playing Star Soldier, does that freaky face that becomes whole mid-level boss

2183
02:52:13,780 --> 02:52:15,580
still appear in the game?

2184
02:52:15,580 --> 02:52:20,700
Yep, every single level almost.

2185
02:52:20,700 --> 02:52:21,700
that

2186
02:52:21,700 --> 02:52:27,220
uh... rini says and one for anybody who's played at e three i hear i heard

2187
02:52:27,220 --> 02:52:33,040
i heard i heard that the e three demo for we heart katamari was exclusive for

2188
02:52:33,040 --> 02:52:38,220
e three it was he even talks to you what was so exclusive about it he actually

2189
02:52:38,220 --> 02:52:38,860
said

2190
02:52:38,860 --> 02:52:42,480
that the others is convention with all these people playing this to see my

2191
02:52:42,480 --> 02:52:44,660
beautiful presence or something

2192
02:52:44,660 --> 02:52:46,720
so it's actually talking about

2193
02:52:46,720 --> 02:52:48,060
people being at e three

2194
02:52:48,060 --> 02:52:51,060
Yeah, it actually, in the text, it actually talks about, like,

2195
02:52:51,060 --> 02:52:55,060
oh, we hope you enjoy this E3 demo, you know, and, like,

2196
02:52:55,060 --> 02:52:59,060
I just remember the E3 was referenced in the King of Cosmos dialogue,

2197
02:52:59,060 --> 02:53:03,060
and it's kind of too bad that that dialogue will probably never see the light of day in the real world,

2198
02:53:03,060 --> 02:53:10,060
because it was that same, like, funny writing, quirky writing, that makes Katamari Damacy so special.

2199
02:53:10,060 --> 02:53:12,060
So that was pretty much what it was.

2200
02:53:12,060 --> 02:53:17,780
That game got delayed till September as well.

2201
02:53:17,780 --> 02:53:20,700
Doh!

2202
02:53:20,700 --> 02:53:25,680
I'll just say, hey Bradley, you live like what, five minutes from my house? Why don't you come over and

2203
02:53:25,680 --> 02:53:29,260
Oh yeah, bring Katamari too! You can bring it.

2204
02:53:29,260 --> 02:53:30,860
An HD loader and an HDL dump, you know.

2205
02:53:30,860 --> 02:53:33,940
Our resident Poppy is the choir. You'll have to come over and show me how to get us it up, by the way.

2206
02:53:33,940 --> 02:53:37,540
I have, I have, we love Katamari on an unmodded

2207
02:53:37,540 --> 02:53:41,140
US PlayStation 2. If I, if I get a US,

2208
02:53:41,140 --> 02:53:45,140
If I get the old-style PlayStation on a hard drive, can I still get an HD loader somehow?

2209
02:53:45,140 --> 02:53:49,140
Yeah, there are free versions that are available for your memory card,

2210
02:53:49,140 --> 02:53:53,140
and you can even run homebrew stuff and all that wonderful stuff without a mod chip.

2211
02:53:53,140 --> 02:53:54,140
Good to hear.

2212
02:53:54,140 --> 02:53:58,140
Sakurino wants to know, what does Loki think about stuffed penises?

2213
02:53:58,140 --> 02:54:01,140
That's the question.

2214
02:54:01,140 --> 02:54:03,140
Look at the monitor yourself, there it is.

2215
02:54:03,140 --> 02:54:09,140
Well, honestly, we were going to get Rob an inflatable penis, and to surprise him,

2216
02:54:09,140 --> 02:54:14,140
We found it at the adult store that we went to.

2217
02:54:14,140 --> 02:54:19,140
We actually went to Gold Club Centerfolds with Rob's roommate and my fiance.

2218
02:54:19,140 --> 02:54:22,140
Oh, and speaking of Rob's roommate, here comes X to her right now.

2219
02:54:22,140 --> 02:54:29,140
And so my fiance, she got a lap dance and the stripper licked her boob.

2220
02:54:29,140 --> 02:54:36,140
And then, well, she was getting like, you know, I personally had to pay for all three of us.

2221
02:54:36,140 --> 02:54:43,180
So, that was a $150 adventure in which I got no lap dance and no boobs rubbed in my face

2222
02:54:43,180 --> 02:54:45,640
and the G6 were fucking awful.

2223
02:54:45,640 --> 02:54:46,640
What the hell happened?

2224
02:54:46,640 --> 02:54:50,860
Lap dance is always better when the stripper is crying.

2225
02:54:50,860 --> 02:54:51,860
X to Purr?

2226
02:54:51,860 --> 02:54:52,860
Yes.

2227
02:54:52,860 --> 02:54:53,860
Gay man?

2228
02:54:53,860 --> 02:54:54,860
Uh huh.

2229
02:54:54,860 --> 02:54:55,860
Stripper club?

2230
02:54:55,860 --> 02:54:56,860
How?

2231
02:54:56,860 --> 02:54:57,860
What the hell?

2232
02:54:57,860 --> 02:54:58,860
What was up with it?

2233
02:54:58,860 --> 02:54:59,860
Actually, I used to go all the time too.

2234
02:54:59,860 --> 02:55:01,380
So, I bet.

2235
02:55:01,380 --> 02:55:03,120
Your first experience, how was it?

2236
02:55:03,120 --> 02:55:05,000
It was great.

2237
02:55:05,000 --> 02:55:08,440
There were strippers. Can I say? Can I say anything?

2238
02:55:08,440 --> 02:55:14,840
You can say whatever you want on the internet. Oh, I can? Okay. I saw a lot of pussy, and

2239
02:55:14,840 --> 02:55:23,500
I saw a lot of ass. And actually, Loki's girlfriend pointed out to me that they bleach their assholes.

2240
02:55:23,500 --> 02:55:27,280
And like, they really do. Oh my God.

2241
02:55:27,280 --> 02:55:31,400
Like they seriously do. Like, it's like regular skin.

2242
02:55:31,400 --> 02:55:33,400
THE SPEAKER LIFUS SHIPPERS!

2243
02:55:33,400 --> 02:55:35,400
Yeah.

2244
02:55:35,400 --> 02:55:40,400
And, um, so yeah, a lot of pussy, a lot of ass, a lot of boobs.

2245
02:55:40,400 --> 02:55:42,400
But I didn't get boobs rubbed in my face either.

2246
02:55:42,400 --> 02:55:43,400
Me neither!

2247
02:55:43,400 --> 02:55:46,400
I'm telling ya! Okay, all three of us were sitting at the goddamn rail.

2248
02:55:46,400 --> 02:55:49,400
I was tipping for all three of us because I had to.

2249
02:55:49,400 --> 02:55:54,400
And, um, who gets the boobs rubbed in their face but my goddamn fiancÃ©?

2250
02:55:54,400 --> 02:55:57,400
You know, as it should be,

2251
02:55:57,400 --> 02:56:05,400
I think what we need to do is we need to crop just that little portion of the show right there and have that be the four-year consideration clip for next year's live agency 5-4.

2252
02:56:05,400 --> 02:56:11,400
It's just expert going, and some strippers bleached their assholes!

2253
02:56:11,400 --> 02:56:14,400
Orange Alarm's Radio, Video Game Radio.

2254
02:56:14,400 --> 02:56:22,400
We like video games and, uh, stripper chat.

2255
02:56:22,400 --> 02:56:25,400
You know...

2256
02:56:25,400 --> 02:56:28,940
highward degenerating into

2257
02:56:28,940 --> 02:56:34,760
pleased at holds that you know i will always get it better than um... then um...

2258
02:56:34,760 --> 02:56:38,660
i think you just made some of your parents and i think i think i think we

2259
02:56:38,660 --> 02:56:43,140
should also use that as the fake way to dark sacros tip of the week you know

2260
02:56:43,140 --> 02:56:44,940
think you know

2261
02:56:44,940 --> 02:56:47,700
we talked about the games are all the time

2262
02:56:47,700 --> 02:56:49,580
we would have time to talk about

2263
02:56:49,580 --> 02:56:58,580
strippers bleaching their assholes. Oh my god, it's actually funny, one of our listeners in the girl's chat says that she's heard about it.

2264
02:56:58,580 --> 02:57:09,580
My god. So good job, good job, Sakarina. Bleach asshole chat. Good job. Your smart ass question about Loki liking stuffed penises just led to that whole discussion.

2265
02:57:09,580 --> 02:57:15,580
That's it, that's it. From now on we no longer have Paris Hilton chat, we have bleach asshole chat. Same difference.

2266
02:57:15,580 --> 02:57:19,220
still wants to go back to strip club but I want to go next time I got boobs in my

2267
02:57:19,220 --> 02:57:25,780
face I got boobs in my face last time I I remember the very same love gay men

2268
02:57:25,780 --> 02:57:30,940
and this is the only time oh yes yes they're like sure with a nice big

2269
02:57:30,940 --> 02:57:35,500
rainbow they're like okay they're oh you're gay oh we could do all sorts of

2270
02:57:35,500 --> 02:57:40,300
things to you I'm like what the hell they have this new flat in their

2271
02:57:40,300 --> 02:57:41,300
boundaries.

2272
02:57:41,300 --> 02:57:42,820
New platinum room and they tie you up.

2273
02:57:42,820 --> 02:57:43,820
Supposedly.

2274
02:57:43,820 --> 02:57:44,820
Anyways.

2275
02:57:44,820 --> 02:57:45,820
Yeah.

2276
02:57:45,820 --> 02:57:46,820
Alright, moving on.

2277
02:57:46,820 --> 02:57:50,780
Listen to Zaku says, now that I, now that my ass has broadband, I need some cool things

2278
02:57:50,780 --> 02:57:54,120
to do besides look at Prawn and the like.

2279
02:57:54,120 --> 02:57:59,180
Some suggestions for Zaku now that he's upgraded to broadband.

2280
02:57:59,180 --> 02:58:00,180

And then get a Bittorrent and download a bunch of Sentai TV.

2287
02:58:16,860 --> 02:58:23,860
I was going to suggest online gaming now that you don't have to develop.

2288
02:58:23,860 --> 02:58:24,860
Get into some online games.

2289
02:58:24,860 --> 02:58:28,860
Oh my god, you can play free Ragnarok with me if I can ever get care at work.

2290
02:58:28,860 --> 02:58:31,860
Try some online games.

2291
02:58:31,860 --> 02:58:32,860
Play PSO with me.

2292
02:58:32,860 --> 02:58:35,860
I'm wondering when I'm going to actually get back to playing Final Fantasy XI.

2293
02:58:35,860 --> 02:58:38,860
All these console games distract me.

2294
02:58:38,860 --> 02:58:47,860
Tomokun wants to know, why did my brother get a text message at 5 a.m. from his jobs assistant manager about his penis size?

2295
02:58:47,860 --> 02:58:48,860
Drunk.

2296
02:58:48,860 --> 02:58:54,860
Um, gay? I don't know. Probably not gay.

2297
02:58:54,860 --> 02:58:56,860
Perhaps he had-

2298
02:58:56,860 --> 02:58:58,860
American penis so big!

2299
02:58:58,860 --> 02:59:06,860
Perhaps he had inquired about his penis size earlier in the day and his boss just finally got around to getting it done.

2300
02:59:06,860 --> 02:59:09,380
Maybe you didn't hear the whole story.

2301
02:59:09,380 --> 02:59:10,700
Maybe that's what's going on.

2302
02:59:14,300 --> 02:59:18,380
Also, moving on, MJSI24 wants to know, I listen to the

2303
02:59:18,380 --> 02:59:21,140
podcast mostly, as I can't listen to the live show

2304
02:59:21,140 --> 02:59:23,500
usually, hey, you and about 1,000 other people, by the

2305
02:59:23,500 --> 02:59:27,120
way, in comparing the ratings from a podcast to the live

2306
02:59:27,120 --> 02:59:30,260
show, but I'm wondering when you record the podcast, what

2307
02:59:30,260 --> 02:59:32,500
are you planning on talking about this week, and what day

2308
02:59:32,500 --> 02:59:35,700
will it officially be posted to iTunes for download?

2309
02:59:35,700 --> 02:59:39,940
We record our podcast, believe it or not, immediately after we do this show, which is

2310
02:59:39,940 --> 02:59:43,460
why if we ever sound a little worn out, or what was the word that one of our emailers

2311
02:59:43,460 --> 02:59:44,460
used once?

2312
02:59:44,460 --> 02:59:47,720
We sound a little dead.

2313
02:59:47,720 --> 02:59:52,620
We sound a little dead because we do this three hour show first and then we do the podcast.

2314
02:59:52,620 --> 02:59:57,460
What we're talking about this week, Dark Sakura, tease that article you wanted me to

2315
02:59:57,460 --> 02:59:58,460
read tonight.

2316
02:59:58,460 --> 03:00:02,900
Yes, there's actually one I'm going to be talking about, those on BBC News, about how

2317
03:00:02,900 --> 03:00:07,460
how parents don't actually pay attention to what the games are rated when they buy them.

2318
03:00:07,460 --> 03:00:08,700
And admit it.

2319
03:00:08,700 --> 03:00:11,280
So another fun parents are ignorant discussion.

2320
03:00:11,280 --> 03:00:12,740
Should be a good time.

2321
03:00:12,740 --> 03:00:16,180
What day will it officially be posted to iTunes to download?

2322
03:00:16,180 --> 03:00:17,080
It should show up.

2323
03:00:17,080 --> 03:00:21,780
It usually gets posted right after midnight Pacific time.

2324
03:00:21,780 --> 03:00:23,300
So early, early Monday morning.

2325
03:00:23,300 --> 03:00:24,680
They're supposed to roll out on Mondays.

2326
03:00:24,680 --> 03:00:27,140
So when you wake up Monday morning, it should be there.

2327
03:00:27,140 --> 03:00:30,580
If not, we had some type of internal problem and we'll get it up as soon as we can.

2328
03:00:30,580 --> 03:00:36,260
So that should answer that.

2329
03:00:36,260 --> 03:00:39,500
Tomokun wants to clarify he was talking about his own cock,

2330
03:00:39,500 --> 03:00:41,500
as he put it.

2331
03:00:41,500 --> 03:00:43,820
Not Tomokun, but anyway, forget it.

2332
03:00:46,580 --> 03:00:49,140
I don't know.

2333
03:00:49,140 --> 03:00:50,220
Yeah.

2334
03:00:50,220 --> 03:00:50,900
I think that was it.

2335
03:00:50,900 --> 03:00:52,340
That was pretty much all the questions we had.

2336
03:00:52,340 --> 03:00:55,900
I thought we might have had one more.

2337
03:00:55,900 --> 03:00:56,620
Did I lose it?

2338
03:00:56,620 --> 03:00:57,180
What did I do?

2339
03:00:57,180 --> 03:00:58,900
Did I accidentally close the window?

2340
03:00:58,900 --> 03:01:01,900
Do we have any emails?

2341
03:01:01,900 --> 03:01:07,480
Our emails were all for... Yeah, all the emails we get are the podcast.

2342
03:01:07,480 --> 03:01:13,900
No one loves us. Remember, a thousand more people listen to the podcast than listen to this show.

2343
03:01:13,900 --> 03:01:15,440
But that's okay.

2344
03:01:15,440 --> 03:01:17,340
So we do this show because we love you guys.

2345
03:01:17,340 --> 03:01:21,840
Really. This is just a labor of love now because we're certainly not getting the ratings.

2346
03:01:21,840 --> 03:01:25,160
It smells like fresh podcast in here.

2347
03:01:25,160 --> 03:01:26,760
are you talking about my podcast

2348
03:01:26,760 --> 03:01:29,200
maybe

2349
03:01:29,200 --> 03:01:33,680
that will never get old

2350
03:01:33,680 --> 03:01:37,520
never never never ever ever ever

2351
03:01:37,520 --> 03:01:40,920

03:03:50,360 --> 03:04:13,360
I'm in love with an electric man An android autonomous with a yellow tan

2386
03:04:13,360 --> 03:04:21,360
His name is Data, I'm such a fan Oh, how I dream about this wired man

He's so logical, he's so clear We'll get it on alive, you're from here

2388
03:04:28,360 --> 03:04:37,360
He's such a turn-on-the-space-age man My luminous lover, my electric man

2389
03:04:43,360 --> 03:04:51,360
There's something about a positronic man The touch and the feel of his plastic hand

2390
03:04:51,360 --> 03:04:54,360
I go wild when I see his eyes

2391
03:04:54,360 --> 03:04:58,360
Of gold and of glow and of from inside

2392
03:04:58,360 --> 03:05:02,360

You know he's fully a-functional, I tell ya

03:05:24,360 --> 03:05:28,360
You know he's fully a-functional, I'm sayin'

2398
03:05:28,360 --> 03:05:31,360
You know he's fully a-functional

2399
03:05:31,360 --> 03:05:35,360
And if he ever gets to us, well, I can always wish him off

2402
03:05:49,360 --> 03:05:58,360
He's more than functional, it's not a dream I saw it once or twice on TV

2403
03:05:58,360 --> 03:06:01,360
Full and functional, it's not a dream

2404
03:06:01,360 --> 03:06:05,360
I saw it once or twice on TV

2405
03:06:05,360 --> 03:06:08,360

2406
03:06:08,360 --> 03:06:11,360

03:06:11,360 --> 03:06:15,360
