Hello everybody, welcome once again to another edition of Orange Lounge Radio To Go.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,080
that podcast dedicated to video games

6
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:35,240
that don't suck. My name is Rob Roberts you might know me as Sky

7
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:38,920
joining us via Skype tonight and I know that we say we usually don't do the

8
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,160
co-host over Skype

9
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,760
but you know we can't help cases of sickness or injury and that's what the

10
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:45,400
one and only

11
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,760
DarkSakura is facing tonight. Hello DarkSakura on the Skype

12
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:53,400
tonight. What's going on? What happened? Are you okay?

13
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:57,480
Well I was covering Classic Gaming Expo for us

14
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:01,360
today and I guess it was a combination of walking around and

15
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,720
you know the driving and then just sitting still practically with my leg

16
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,520
extended

17
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:09,840
but my hip flared up really bad so I'm sorta hyped up on Vicodin tonight

18
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,960
alright so we can't have her driving over to the studio when she's on Vicodin

19
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,440
so

20
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:17,680
but you you gotta tell us a little bit about Classic Gaming Expo tonight?

21
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,280
it was about the same as it was last year they had more games that actually

22
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:21,920
worked

23
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,840
had my picture taken by a millipede that'll

24
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,440
to be somewhere on our site eventually.

25
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:33,920
Got to meet some pretty cool people, including the guys who do retro gaming radio.

26
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,880
They're pretty cool.

27
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,200
And got to just see all kinds of stuff.

28
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,880
I bought Famicon games today.

29
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:42,960
Oh, very cool.

30
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,720
Like the original Japanese Nintendo.

31
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,160
I bought Final Fantasy II.

32
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,500
Cool.

33
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,760
And I got Final Fantasy V for Super Famicon.

34
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:54,920
I got Mappyland for Famicon.

35
00:01:54,920 --> 00:02:01,380
some PC Engine Q-Cards. We actually got a PC Engine in Core Graphics today. Just some

36
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:04,620
other little bits and pieces that I'll have pictures of shortly.

37
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:08,820
Alright, sounds good. How did you think this year's Classic Gaming Expo compared to previous

38
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,860
years that you've been to?

39
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:18,020
It was really, it was empty. Then again, we did go on second day toward the end, but there

40
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:22,040
was just an emptiness, I felt, to it, which is probably a good idea they're taking next

41
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:26,760
year off because I'm hoping the one in 2007 is going to be fantastic.

42
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:32,120
It's supposed to be their anniversary, their, I think, 10th anniversary.

43
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,120
Very cool.

44
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,760
So I'm hoping it's big and maybe, you know, maybe if it works out we can get in on that.

45
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,960
Yeah, I definitely want to check it out when it comes back and they always have a really

46
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,240
good show at E3 as well.

47
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,120
I like the concept of Classic Gaming Expo.

48
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,040
Hopefully a year off we'll just recharge them a little bit and they'll be good to go in

49
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,880
in 2007, so I'm looking forward to that, definitely.

50
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,960
Well 8-Bit Weapon was back. Oh, how were they?

51
00:02:54,960 --> 00:03:00,200
They were awesome as always, and another guy was there

52
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,560
as part of the convention playing music on a keyboard.

53
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:07,320
Pretty cool stuff. Because sometimes, now I remember the Classic Gaming Expo when I

54
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,360
went last year, they were actually showing

55
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,600
Gradius 5. Konami had a booth there showing Gradius 5.

56
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,920
Midway had a booth showing their

57
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,640
Treasures 2 collection which was new last year. Was there any new

58
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,840
type games they were showing off at the Classic Gaming Expo? Retro?

59
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:26,400
Not really. Not really? Not a whole lot? Actually, there

60
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,280
there were people who were doing, you know, new prototypes

61
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:34,240
but nothing, you know, there was the television people were there again.

62
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:38,940
Right. There was a guy, he said it's actually someone in Brazil makes these, but they

63
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:41,000
take the MSX games, like the

64
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,520
Metal Gear and the original Metal Gear 2 were on MSX, as was the

65
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:49,960
the Guardian Legend, it was called Guardia, they were all MSX games and they have them

66
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:55,240
remade to play on the Colecovision.

67
00:03:55,240 --> 00:04:02,320
That was neat, but there wasn't anything really new there, nothing like what Guardia 5 was

68
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,320
last year.

69
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:10,620
Alright, well we'll look forward to more reports on Classic Gaming Expo on our website, www.orangelaungeradio.com.

70
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:14,960
Dark Sakura's picture collection will be posted sometime during the week, so we look forward

71
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:18,620
Now, I haven't forgotten, four minutes into the show, but I haven't forgotten the one

72
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:21,760
and only Tech Masa Loki over there in studio tonight.

73
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,720
I wasn't even paying attention, I was reading.

74
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,400
What are you, not a classic gaming fan?

75
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,400
What's up with that?

76
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,400
No, I'm a classic gaming fan.

77
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,280
I was kind of zoned out there because I was looking up stuff for the show.

78
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,280
I was researching.

79
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:39,120
Well, since I let Dark Sakura do a little report there, why don't you give us one of

80
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,240
your stories you're looking at tonight from the hack and crack scene.

81
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:49,240
My report, I was just kind of browsing stuff. One of them is a mod for Half-Life 2 called Half-Life 2 Fueled.

82
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:56,240
And because Half-Life 2 is famous for its ragdoll physics and playing with the ragdoll physics.

83
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,240
They have some really kickass shots from this.

84
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,240
Just like, you know, for example, tons of cars just all strewn about the place.

85
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:11,240
It looks like it's going to be pretty cool. They've got some ramps in this little demo thing here.

86
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:18,120
thing here. You can find out more about it on www.fueledmod.com and they've got some

87
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,800
interesting stuff on there. So, yeah, cool.

88
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,160
Alright. Alright, well now what I want to do is I want to go ahead and start off tonight's

89
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,960
show, even though we had a couple stories there, to start off tonight's show talking

90
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:32,000
about what we like to always start off the show talking about, what games have we, the

91
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,400
host, been playing this week. DarkSakura, what have you been playing this week in your

92
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,400
game and world?

93
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:42,080
Well, seeing as how I started school this week, I haven't had a whole bunch of time

94
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,640
and I actually am going to be signing back up for Ragnarok Online again.

95
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:50,580
It's funny you should talk about signing up for old MMOs.

96
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:53,840
You're not signing back up for Final Fantasy XI, are you?

97
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,920
I wouldn't say I'm not going to.

98
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,920
Anyway.

99
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:05,820
I'm going to give Ragnarok a try for a month to see if I really miss it as badly as I think

100
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:08,660
I do that's my philosophy on Final Fantasy as well

101
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:14,860
But they have like a pay seven dollars and for 30 hours a gameplay, so I'm gonna give that a go okay

102
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:17,980
Sounds good this for a month. I did I

103
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,620
hunted down the vet tracks and

104
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:24,620
Then I remembered why I don't play the vet tracks because it kind of gave me a headache

105
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:27,060
But the vet tracks was just a cool idea really

106
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,180
well true

107
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,460
I also

108
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:36,740
I tried out a couple of HuCards at Classic Gaming Expo today.

109
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:41,740
Actually, I also watched Dan try out some of the ones that we bought. We got

110
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,700
Sanson 2. That game is cool.

111
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:46,380
Wow, I don't think I've heard of that.

112
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:50,620
Oh yeah, okay, I have heard of that, but that's a, wow, that's an obscure game.

113
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:54,740
Yeah, pretty obscure. A lot of stuff at Classic Gaming I suppose is obscure.

114
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:58,780
We also got Legend of the Valkyrie, which is one of

115
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:03,180
uh, Namco's classic games. Very cool. But not a lot of other current games you've been

116
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,620
playing this week? Just the old stuff?

117
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:08,940
Just the old stuff. You know, I had to get my retro gaming back on.

118
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:12,980
Nothing wrong with that. Nothing wrong with that. Uh, Loki, what games have you been playing this week?

119
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:17,580
Um, I've been playing pretty much the same stuff I was playing last week. I played

120
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:21,300
a teeny bit of Darkwatch, because it came out this week.

121
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:25,140
Um, it's really cool, but I haven't really gotten to play much of it.

122
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:31,300
Burnout 3 like crazy been playing that every second that I could possibly play it. It's really fun

123
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:34,160
I've just haven't played much of the tracks, but I did do

124
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:38,220
54 takedowns in one race that was fun and

125
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:44,040
Then I was playing also on the PSP Taiko no Tatujin

126
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:50,800
So so taiko drum master here in the u.s.. Yes, that's got to be weird on the PSP though

127
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,100
I mean it works really good actually yeah

128
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:58,020
I kind of looked over your shoulder while you were playing it and it looks really crisp

129
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:01,100
and it's just like the PlayStation 2 version right on your little PSP.

130
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,420
Yeah, it's really good and it's pretty fun.

131
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:08,040
I just wish it was in English so I'd be able to understand what menus were and stuff because

132
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,540
it's a pain in the ass.

133
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:14,580
But someone did make some on Game Facts, I think, English translations of the menus so

134
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:15,580
that helps.

135
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:16,580
That's always helpful.

136
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,580
Yeah.

137
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,580
Those Game Facts people are always very helpful.

138
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,340
It is, but you know what they could help me out with?

139
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:27,200
Cheats for freaking burnout three because I gotta play through these races and I'm not liking that I need I need my fast cars now

140
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:32,480
Alright, um, I my gaming week. Is that all you've had? I'm sad

141
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:38,900
It's all I have right my gaming week has consisted of my well. I was sick this week. Actually Jamie has

142
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:43,220
Unfortunately her hip but I've been sick. I had a sinus infection earlier this week

143
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:48,420
So if I sound my voice is a little more nasal than it even usually is it's because I've been sick

144
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:53,940
so that kind of kept me down for a little bit but I was I did finally go

145
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:59,560
out on Saturday and buy a an American PlayStation 2 I've had a Japanese one for

146
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:03,540
years to get my music gaming fix out of the way and but since I was living with

147
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:08,580
Loki for such a long time he had an American PlayStation 2 I didn't have a

148
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:12,020
need for my own so I finally went and bought one on Saturday I bought one of

149
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:17,100
the little chibi miniature ones it's I really hadn't seen one because everybody

150
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:21,440
else I know got their PlayStation 2s like years ago, so they're huge, so I hadn't really

151
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:27,580
seen the tiny ones up close. Damn, those are tiny PlayStations! Dang, they are so small,

152
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:32,220
I was shocked. But it's great, it works out great for my storage space and everything.

153
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:36,420
So I picked up two games, I picked up Final Fantasy X, because I had the urge to play

154
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:41,000
through that again, and Katamari Damacy, because I just freaking love that game. And I'm gonna

155
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,780
pick up other... What? I could have just loaned you mine indefinitely, since I have Final

156
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:46,780
Final Fantasy X International.

157
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:47,780
Ah!

158
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:48,780
Now I know.

159
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:49,780
Oh well.

160
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:50,780
It's only 20 bucks.

161
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:51,780
I'm throwing it half the hassle.

162
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:53,780
You're getting a little quiet there, Jamie.

163
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:54,780
Okay.

164
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:55,780
Sorry, my headset moved back.

165
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:56,780
Oh, that's alright.

166
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,780
I'm throwing it half the hassle.

167
00:09:58,780 --> 00:09:59,780
Alright.

168
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:07,780
Um, anyway, um, also, um, I bought the Playstation 2 so that I could, you know, screen new games

169
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:11,820
if we start getting any screeners, um, I should say additional screeners from like, you know,

170
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:12,820
media companies and stuff.

171
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:13,980
I do have demos at work.

172
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:14,980
I haven't brought them in though.

173
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:19,260
So we'll start taking a look at those, and as well as just renting some games and checking

174
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:22,280
things out so I can keep a tab on what's going on.

175
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:27,780
Also other than the Playstation 2, as Dark Sakura made me admit a little bit ago, I also

176
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:32,460
renewed Final Fantasy XI because I was sick and home from work and really bored, and I

177
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:34,900
thought, you know, I kind of miss this game.

178
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,620
No, not just that, Dark Sakura, wait until you hear this.

179
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:41,940
Not only did I get back into Final Fantasy XI, I got my roommate, Christopher, into Final

180
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:42,940
People are cultists!

181
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:43,940
I escaped!

182
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:44,940
I escaped!

183
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:57,140
You sure did, but you're in Ragnarok, which is, you know, some people would say just as

184
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,140
bad.

185
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:02,460
Hey, I've been in Ragnarok for like, what, five years?

186
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,460
Six years?

187
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:04,460
Yeah, well.

188
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,460
You're still getting quiet there.

189
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:06,780
My addiction is stronger than your addiction.

190
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,920
You're a little quiet there, DarkSogra.

191
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,180
My addiction is stronger than your addiction.

192
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:16,020
My addiction is mighty, and to be feared.

193
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:17,220
We'll see about that.

194
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:21,420
Alright, let's get into this week's news, starting off with, of course, the big thing

195
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:26,980
everybody is talking about this week, Zelda Twilight Princess got the big old delay to

196
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:34,060
Spring 2006, and of course, the question heard around the world, what the hell, Nintendo?

197
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,060
What the hell?

198
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:38,820
You had this game ready to show us at E3, and we thought you were all ready to go in

199
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:44,400
the fall but now they're saying no we need more time we're announcing a new

200
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:48,420
global launch in 2006 after the conclusion of the fiscal year so no

201
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:52,680
earlier than April 1st will provide a specific date at a later point in time

202
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:56,760
while this may come as a disappointment it will absolutely enrich the game and

203
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:00,420
make it a multi-million seller I don't know about that because I've been that

204
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:08,700
anyways I know but there's what yeah hopefully it's released

205
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:13,620
around your birthday, but the reason why they say they're doing this is because they're

206
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:18,300
adding extra things to it, who knows, the game could be buggy as hell, who really knows

207
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:22,300
why this game got pushed back, but what they're saying is that they're trying to add new things

208
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:27,780
to it, which I suppose is good news, but at the same time, it's not like there's been

209
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:32,300
a flood of GameCube games lately, they really should have been working on this double time

210
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,300
a while ago.

211
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:38,740
What we've got is a bunch of game testers going, BUT I HAVEN'T BEATEN IT YET, DELAY!

212
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:06,860
you know because by that point the PlayStation 3 will be out almost

213
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:10,500
maybe maybe not Xbox 360 will be out will be

214
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,540
hopefully having more details on Nintendo's revolution so it'll be like

215
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:18,060
you know Zelda Twilight Princess was kinda as amazing of a game as it looked

216
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:21,180
I it's it's almost a little late for this game to be coming out

217
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:25,940
so I'm a little disappointed. I just say when it comes out it needs to be something freakin' fantastic

218
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:30,180
but a good game is a good game right? Yes a game

219
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:33,300
is only as good as how it plays. That's true. Loki, your thoughts?

220
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:38,820
Um, yay. You know, they give me a reason to dust off my GameCube, but

221
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:42,460
oh well. Um, I was gonna mention also

222
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:45,940
another delay that pisses the hell out of me. Final Fantasy

223
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:50,980
Advent Children's not coming out until the end of November, November 30th.

224
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:54,740
Not many places have actually, no one's really said anything about this delay, but

225
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:56,100
I have the inside info

226
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:59,660
being that I work for a video distributor, so. Mmm. So it,

227
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:02,900
that's straight from Sony folks well okay

228
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:05,940
guys gotta hate it but I hope I hope I'm wrong

229
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:10,340
and I hope that that that you know date is just pull out thin air and so he is

230
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:11,340
another talk about but

231
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:15,100
I'm afraid strip you know speaking of Advent Children you know how they're

232
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,020
gonna be doing those screenings in Japan

233
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:20,300
well the only way you're gonna be able to get into the screenings in Japan

234
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:23,900
which by the way is only taking place in three major cities across Japan

235
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:28,660
on you're gonna have to be a member of their fan club now I have obviously

236
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:32,620
the majority of our listening audiences in the United States, Canada

237
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:36,040
and some in Europe so probably not a whole lot of Japanese listeners we've

238
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:36,840
got but

239
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:40,040
if you are listening to us and you're interested in going you need to be

240
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:43,200
registered with the Shinra Company online fan club

241
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:47,500
and I'm guessing if you're not already signed up you might have lost out because I don't

242
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,440
think they're accepting new club members anymore

243
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,940
so they will randomly select people if they get too many people that want to

244
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:54,480
get in

245
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,600
it's going to be happening September 10th through the 16th

246
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:04,800
in Tokyo, Nagoya, and Kyoto will be the three cities that will be showing

247
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,520
Final Fantasy Advent Children on the big screen.

248
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:12,200
Otherwise you're gonna have to wait for the UMD and DVD formats

249
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:18,060
here in America as well. One other story, I know the big news this week, the game

250
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:21,080
we're all excited about is Nintendogs is coming out this week.

251
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:25,420
I'm very excited about this. Here's the interesting thing about Nintendogs,

252
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:29,460
they're actually going to be getting a special holiday edition well okay it's

253
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:34,580
kind of a rumor right now but Nintendo of America did file some some papers

254
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:40,640
with the ESRB that indicate something called Nintendogs holiday edition and we

255
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:45,340
all know how Nintendo loves to get you to buy the same crap in new packaging

256
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:49,420
over and over again so this really wouldn't be a surprise if this is

257
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:53,080
something they are actually doing Nintendogs holiday edition what do you

258
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:59,080
Are they being premature with this though, since the game hasn't even come out here?

259
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:02,080
It could be a massive failure here, I doubt it will be, but it could be.

260
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:07,080
No, it's not going to be a failure, and it's coming out right after my wedding, you know.

261
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:13,080
Is that a hint? You're already going to get it. We don't have to buy it for your wedding, you're already going to have it.

262
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:22,080
Of course. No, I honestly see the game being a big success, because if there's one thing Nintendo understands, it's a formula.

263
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:29,080
a formula. You know, we have Pokemon as our big example. They know what's going to appeal,

264
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:34,340
and there's already been so much hype from the Japanese version, it's already so widely

265
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:39,340
popular, that, you know, I don't see any way for the game to fail.

266
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:45,160
Well, we'll see. We'll see this week when the game comes out. Alright, moving on, I

267
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:49,320
did want to say one other thing about Nintendo, and that is the Game Boy Micro. The Game Boy

268
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:55,860
the game boy micro are going to come for $99.99

269
00:16:55,860 --> 00:17:00,280
now for those of you who weren't sleeping during E3 coverage

270
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:03,740
it's like the game boy advance but really freaking tiny

271
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:05,740
like a palm of your hand tiny

272
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,740
its a little bigger then the game boy advance cartridges

273
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:10,760
if you go look on our E3 pictures

274
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:13,280
they have a pretty close up image of one

275
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,220
they do we do have that in the gallery

276
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:19,220
four inches wide this thing is it's it's tiny

277
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:21,500
uh... ninety nine ninety nine it'll be coming out

278
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:26,320
uh... september nineteenth is the day this is coming out also face plates the

279
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:29,420
face plate changing is a big thing they're doing with this so you can have

280
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:32,660
uh... a gameboy micro that like matches your purse or something i don't know

281
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:37,620
flame camouflage or just simple silver

282
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,340
well that's one of them

283
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:42,900
if you buy the silver you get those if you buy black you get uh... some

284
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,340
stupid flower

285
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:46,620
Oh, Ladybug. Okay, I see.

286
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:49,100
With the Ladybug. I see where these others come in, okay.

287
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,660
And Ammonite for Dark Swirly Blue.

288
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:57,700
And also, yeah, they come with the silver or black faceplate, depending on whether yours is silver or black.

289
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:03,660
Okay. Japanese release will be September 13th, and it will be coming out for 12,000 yen.

290
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:06,980
That's about $109, so it's a little more expensive in Japan.

291
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:13,820
But get this, for our European friends, we're paying $99, they're paying 99 euro,

292
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:17,480
and the euros worth a little more so that's a hundred and twenty one dollars

293
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:20,600
u s november fourth but they get paid too bad

294
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,440
yes but they get pink

295
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,220
not that you know

296
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:26,380
yeah i know

297
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:30,420
we're gonna take a minute to uh... open up the old mailbag here at orange lounge

298
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:33,640
radio remember you guys can send in your questions

299
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,860
for orange lounge radio at our address it's to go

300
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,140
t o g o

301
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:39,980
at orange lounge radio

302
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,660
dot com

303
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:45,460
So we have a couple of letters this week, the first letter I'd like to read comes from

304
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:50,580
Sithspawn is the name of the person, actually it's Brian from Michigan is how they signed

305
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,300
it, so that must be his online name.

306
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:56,940
Brian from Michigan says he knows he's beating a dead horse here a little bit but he wants

307
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:00,900
to make the following point, I don't have any kids and I don't ever want them, however

308
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:05,000
I do have a few words concerning video game violence and ratings.

309
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,820
The main problem originates with the many groups pushing for stricter ratings and or

310
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:11,420
the banning of certain games.

311
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:15,300
Attempting to completely block games from kids at the point of sale level is a massive

312
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,780
waste of effort.

313
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:20,600
Much like drugs and alcohol, you will never keep games away from someone who actively

314
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,140
seeks them out.

315
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:26,540
Kids will play games at their friends' houses, at stores, or acquire them from others.

316
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,640
There is nothing parents can do to stop this.

317
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,460
I think we have good point of sale controls now and that's enough.

318
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:36,180
Brian from Michigan is suggesting there are two simple steps to deal with this problem.

319
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,180
1.

320
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:38,180
Know your games.

321
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:41,860
As a parent, you need to know about the ratings and actually play these games.

322
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:44,820
Also, take the ratings with a grain of salt.

323
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:48,340
The opinions of the ESRB aren't necessarily your own.

324
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,340
2.

325
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:50,340
Instruct your child.

326
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:54,380
The only way to prevent your kid from playing the games you do not want them to play is

327
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:57,300
to ensure that they do not want to play them.

328
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,860
It's exactly the same as saying no to drugs.

329
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:05,220
It's all about the child making decisions based on input from the parents.

330
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:10,260
Give your kid the tools he or she needs to make educated decisions when you are not around.

331
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,260
Very interesting.

332
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:13,420
I like his steps there that he offers there.

333
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:17,220
A very educated response from our friend, Sith Spawn.

334
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,220
I was very impressed with that letter.

335
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:21,260
Yes, it was very nice.

336
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,480
We also have another letter here.

337
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,260
This letter is from another Jamie.

338
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:28,760
It actually could be Jaime, but we think it's Jamie.

339
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:32,900
Jamie's been listening to the show for two months now and says it's really interesting.

340
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:33,900
Thank you.

341
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,640
you guys won the podcast award, partially because of my vote.

342
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,640
Thank you again.

343
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,640
Very kind.

344
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,840
I know exactly what you mean about the misspelling of your name in talking to our own Jamie here.

345
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,480
I have the exact same problem, but in reverse.

346
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:49,020
This person spells their name J-A-I-M-E.

347
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,880
So very interesting.

348
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,440
We were talking about Evercrack's economy.

349
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:59,140
Well, Jamie actually sent us a link to an article about the economy, and it's a really

350
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:02,220
good link to a story that has more information on the economy.

351
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:12,460
It's http colon slash slash mu dot ranter r-a-n-t-e-r dot net slash theory slash economy

352
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:14,460
dot html.

353
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:19,040
And actually what this is, this is kind of like an opinion piece about the economy inside

354
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,040
video games.

355
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,340
It's a really well written piece.

356
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:22,820
So if you guys have some time, check that out.

357
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:23,820
That's very cool.

358
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:28,380
Also, Jamie wanted to point out a website called Stop Stop Kill dot com.

359
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:31,980
Jamie, did you have a chance to check out Stop Stop Kill dot com?

360
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:37,600
Ashley, this is one I knew about and it's, at the time it was more of a placeholder but

361
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,100
it actually is, looks like it's gone full active.

362
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,980
It's about the truth about violence in video games.

363
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:48,660
Is someone else, you know, trying to get the word out there?

364
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:54,560
Basically there, any type of research that's being done in regards to video games, they're

365
00:21:54,560 --> 00:22:00,960
putting this up on their site and then, you know, also putting out, trying to give the

366
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:06,000
whole broad spectrum you know but also trying to say hey this is where you are

367
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:12,920
wrong hmm it's a pretty awesome site so far I'm pretty impressed with it it also

368
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:18,320
there's a forum on here it says gamers against Jack forum interesting Jack

369
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:26,440
Thompson and also it links back to Jack Thompson site stop kill calm which is

370
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,960
basically talking is basically more of

371
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,280
Jack Thompson talking out of his ass

372
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:34,800
well it's true the man's the man I hate

373
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,720
to say well I'm not I don't really hate

374
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,640
to say it but he's freaking idiot hmm

375
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,420
Jack Thompson if you're listening

376
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:43,000
you're a moron thank you for that he'll

377
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,240
appreciate that and you can sue me for

378
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,800
calling you a moron because that's my

379
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,520
personal opinion and not a personal

380
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:51,240
attack all right anyway anyway moving on

381
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:54,080
yeah moving forward but this site is

382
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,880
pretty cool and we know we need more

383
00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:00,900
stuff like this, I'm actually going to, as soon as I get an opportunity to send this

384
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:08,220
guy a link to that article I found on Game Revolution, with the information provided

385
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:15,140
from the FBI and Department of Justice showing the crime rate in youth going down since the

386
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,140
release of the PS1.

387
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:18,140
I think they need my benefit from that.

388
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:19,140
Alright.

389
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:22,300
Now, it's funny that we got an email from somebody named Jamie, because we also got

390
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:25,180
an email from somebody named Rob.

391
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:29,160
And I'm actually going to start with Rob's P.S. because he said kind of a nice thing

392
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,140
here and I just want to repeat it.

393
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:35,860
Rob said something about, sorry for delaying a podcast and listeners inquiring what went

394
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:36,860
on.

395
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:38,820
I appreciate your contribution to the video game media.

396
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:41,780
Since it's free, I don't think I have any right to demand it.

397
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:42,860
People should be more gracious.

398
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:44,480
Well, that's really nice, Rob.

399
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,480
We try our best.

400
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,480
You're right.

401
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,100
We don't get paid for this or anything.

402
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,980
We just do this because we're bored.

403
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:55,120
But no, we love games, so we do this because we can and we're glad that at least

404
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,380
you know we're glad that just one person out there's listening let alone you know

405
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:01,540
hundreds and hundreds of folks even now I think it is thousands of folks

406
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,680
listening so it's just great thank you guys so much

407
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:07,320
We really dig all of our listeners. We do it's awesome

408
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:12,360
also he actually had a response to an article

409
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:15,880
about virtual ethics which I thought was very interesting

410
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:19,240
DarkSakura did you have any reports on like

411
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:23,520
ethics going on like the mugging that's going on in games or anything?

412
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:29,600
Well, just to give sort of a bit of the paraphrasing from this one article that he linked me to,

413
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:34,400
a man was arrested in Japan on suspicion of carrying out a virtual mugging spree by using

414
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:38,240
software bots to beat up and rob characters in the online game Lineage 2.

415
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,240
I got to try that at E3 a couple of years ago.

416
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,240
Hmm.

417
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,240
That's what you do in that game.

418
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,720
The stolen possessions, the virtual items, were exchanged for cash.

419
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:53,440
It was a Chinese exchange student that was arrested for this in Kagawa.

420
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:59,720
Several players had their characters beaten and robbed of valuable virtual objects, the

421
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:02,720
name's items called Earring of Wisdom and Shield of Nightmare, I guess they're pretty

422
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:09,560
big things in Lineage, but the items were fenced off through a Japanese auction website,

423
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:14,320
according to NCSoft, that's the company that makes Lineage 2, and he did it by using a

424
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,560
software bot, so it couldn't be beaten.

425
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,520
Interesting, so there's always a way around this.

426
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,120
Well, I want to read Rob's response to this.

427
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:26,620
If you feel your character and stuff are worth paying blackmail, you seriously need a real

428
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:27,620
life.

429
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:32,040
Who knows, maybe the virtual mugging sent the victim home from the internet cafe early

430
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:36,460
to inadvertently save the lives of himself and or his neglected offspring.

431
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:38,560
Blackmail in real life is a serious crime.

432
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,200
Virtual ethics had nothing to do with the perps arrest.

433
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,380
One should seriously check themselves when they say virtual ethics.

434
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:46,760
It literally means ethics that aren't real.

435
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:54,760
Therefore, in the realm of actually having a real life, virtual ethics are inconsequential.

436
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,760
Thank you.

437
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,760
I finally got it there at the end.

438
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,760
So, very interesting.

439
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:04,760
Alright, that's going to do it for the mailbag, unless you have anything extra over there,

440
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:05,760
DarkSakura.

441
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,760
I think that was it, yes, for this week?

442
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:15,760
I just, in regards to the virtual ethics thing, sad.

443
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:23,760
for society. Actually, I did have another email actually that was linked to me.

444
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,760
Sure.

445
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:29,600
I'll just go ahead. It was an article that was within it. Unfortunately, I couldn't find

446
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:37,120
the original one, but it's a little brief one. Going back to the game addiction business,

447
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:43,480
a 28-year-old South Korean man died of exhaustion in an internet cafe after playing computer

448
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:48,000
games non-stop for 49 hours.

449
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,880
They only got his last name, Lee.

450
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:55,840
He was a resident in the southern city of, I guess it's pronounced Ty-goo.

451
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,800
He collapsed Friday after eating minimally and not sleeping, refusing to leave his keyboard

452
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:03,160
while he played the battle simulation game, Starcraft.

453
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:07,340
He was moved to a hospital but died a few hours later due to what the doctors are presuming

454
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:08,720
was a heart attack.

455
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,920
I swear I've heard this story before.

456
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:15,940
Maybe not this exact same person, but I swear I've heard this exact same setup, internet

457
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:19,940
cafe, person there playing their game too damn much, and dying from it.

458
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:20,940
I swear I've heard this before.

459
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,300
It happened a couple weeks ago.

460
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:24,300
Somebody didn't get the hint the last time, apparently.

461
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:29,260
Well actually, when I got the link on this, it was earlier within the week, and the time

462
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:30,260
says five hours ago.

463
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:31,260
Interesting.

464
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:32,260
So it was fairly recent.

465
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:36,200
They also said that he'd been fired from his job because he kept missing work to play computer

466
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,200
games.

467
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,200
Wow.

468
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,180
So that's like, instead of drinking, he gamed.

469
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:50,180
Yeah, and you know, if you look at it this way, for the people who are those hardcore addicts to booze,

470
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:55,180
they're trying to escape from something that's gone wrong in their life.

471
00:27:55,180 --> 00:28:01,180
These people are using games in return to escape from the bad that's gone on in their life.

472
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:07,180
How would an internet cafe allow you to be there for 48 hours straight?

473
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:12,420
I mean, I know there's 24-hour cafes and everything, but isn't that an ethical business in the

474
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:13,420
first place?

475
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:16,540
I realize we're talking about another country, but I know they're making money, but at some

476
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:18,180
point, don't you have to draw the line?

477
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:19,940
You've got to sleep at some point.

478
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:20,940
Hold on.

479
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:26,220
When you go to a bar and the bartender sees that you've had one too many drinks, the bartender

480
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:31,760
has a, I don't know if it's legal, I'm almost positive it is, but they have an ethical point

481
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,300
to say, you know what, buddy, I can't serve you any more drinks.

482
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:35,300
You're too drunk.

483
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:38,980
I mean, one thing I need to point out that they've mentioned repeatedly in my business

484
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:43,960
law class, ethics will change from country to country.

485
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,680
And I, okay, I understand that.

486
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:49,100
We're talking about another country here, we're not talking about the US, but still,

487
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:54,900
I mean, I don't care where in the world you are, why didn't somebody stop this guy?

488
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,440
This man was ultimately responsible for himself.

489
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,440
I understand that.

490
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:03,540
By all rights, they did not have, it's not their place to tell him how to live his life

491
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:04,540
basically.

492
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:11,220
But he was a paying customer if he chooses to pay with his life for that it really isn't there

493
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:15,100
I mean, I made this may sound cold, but really isn't there concern. I understand that point

494
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,900
I it is ultimately his fault

495
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:22,140
but why didn't anybody his friend a loved one who noticed he was missing for 48 hours a

496
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:30,180
Worker at the place who must have seen this going on nobody intervened and that's like not good Samaritan

497
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:35,260
I know nobody should let anybody play Starcraft for that long. Anyway, I

498
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:38,620
Saw that coming. I do

499
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:46,780
Caught up in whatever your addiction is to the point you start, you know cutting out your friends your family

500
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:53,780
You know, people are, you know, humans are humans, they're eventually going to give up.

501
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:57,780
And ultimately, he paid for his price and I'm thinking about turning him over to the

502
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:58,780
Darwin Awards.

503
00:29:58,780 --> 00:29:59,780
Seriously.

504
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:02,460
Well, let us know what happens with that.

505
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:06,860
You know, and I say the same thing about MMOs, like, you know, if you guys are out there

506
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:11,900
and you're canceling your social life to stay in and play an MMO, you seriously got to question

507
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:12,900
your priorities.

508
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:13,900
Seriously.

509
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:18,340
once in a great while it might be okay because you know you're not feeling up

510
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:21,700
to it or whatever but if you notice yourself you're doing it repeatedly over

511
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:24,400
and over again you're not going out and having a real life because you're

512
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:29,240
staying in and playing video games of any nature really not just MMOs you got

513
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:32,380
to get outdoors once in a while that's why we do our advice column which I

514
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:40,060
guess is a good segue into that port portion of the show right really I

515
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:45,060
I stayed out of school for a week to play Final Fantasy III, which was VI.

516
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:48,060
But you didn't do that all the time, right?

517
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:52,060
No, and I actually did legitimately develop the flu within that week.

518
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:56,060
Oh, okay. Well, see, it's still a little extreme.

519
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:58,060
I still might kind of raise my eyebrow at that and go,

520
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:59,060
Jamie, you know, but...

521
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:02,060
There's also the point that I was in high school.

522
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,060
Right.

523
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:05,060
I'm an adult now. That man was an adult.

524
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:06,060
Right.

525
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:07,060
There was no excuse.

526
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:12,060
Yeah, and it's not like you do this every time a new game comes out, you know.

527
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:13,060
Oh, hell no.

528
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:17,060
I was an addict of Final Fantasy III in the US as well.

529
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:20,060
I just bounce uncontrollably at work until I get to go home and play it.

530
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:21,060
Right.

531
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:24,060
Alright, let's get to tonight's advice column.

532
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:31,060
Because, you know, if we just played video games all day long, we'd have no time to live.

533
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:34,060
So DarkSakura is here to give us her advice column.

534
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:37,060
DarkSakura, what is your advice about TONIGHT?

535
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:44,060
Today's bit of advice is how to survive if you are in the line of fire if you are the primary target.

536
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:49,060
You know, that means like, everyone else is wearing camo, you're wearing white.

537
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:55,060
Number one, get as far away as possible, AKA run like hell.

538
00:31:56,060 --> 00:32:01,060
An untrained shooter is not likely to be accurate at any distance greater than 60 feet.

539
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:13,060
2. Run fast, but do not move in a straight line. Weave back and forth. The average shooter will not have the training necessary to hit a moving target at any real distance.

540
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:17,060
3. Turn a corner if possible. Well, duh.

541
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:27,060
4. Do not bother to count shots. You will have no idea the shooter has more ammunition. Counting is only for the movies.

542
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:29,660
My final bit of advice. Yes

543
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:44,020
I think that's my favorite final piece of advice you've ever given on this program. Yes. Nice. Thank you. You getting shot at

544
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:47,020
freaking shoot back

545
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,720
Nice real nice

546
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:53,060
Loki what else you get

547
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:56,060
I'm so angry that they would make a mistake!

548
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:59,060
Now go away before I taunt you a second time.

549
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:02,060
Loki, what's going on in the hacking crack scene?

550
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:04,060
Oh, there's tons of stuff.

551
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:07,060
First off, there was a nice cel-shading demo that was released,

552
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:12,060
kind of showing what homebrew stuff can do right now, which is kind of neat.

553
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:19,060
And then also on top of that, looks like SanDisk was announcing that they're going to be releasing.

554
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:24,260
2GB memory stick here pretty soon. So that's always good, especially for those people that

555
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:31,060
are pirating stuff. Very cool. And also, which was really neat, someone made a game called

556
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:39,420
NORT, which is a Tron light cycle racing game, you know, all those out there. And also, it

557
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:45,060
was a good week if you are a music composer and you use a PSP because there's quite a

558
00:33:45,060 --> 00:34:10,060
few homebrew programs that were made. The first one being TI-MIDI. It's a MIDI playing program that's on the PSP, which was kind of interesting. There was a rhythm composer program being made, a PSP rhythm composer, and that's kind of like a drum machine type thing, which is interesting.

559
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:18,060
Also, there was a program that was released called PSP-Tune, which helps you tune your guitar.

560
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:22,060
So, very interesting stuff.

561
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:35,060
On the DS end of things, there was also an update done to the Coleco Vision emulator, which is called Coleco DS, appropriately.

562
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:40,860
and version 0.2 is released and they've got some interesting screenshots on

563
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:42,460
ndsupdates.com

564
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:47,100
so go check those out if you have some time. And that's all I've got so far.

565
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:50,860
Alright, sounds good. You know it's funny you mention a lot of those music things

566
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:52,300
going on because there's some big

567
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:57,060

587
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:14,260

OrangeLawnTrader.com that's going to be karaoke revolution party edition coming out a little later this year

596
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:51,600
Konami's also announcing sweet code and tactics which is going to be coming out for the PlayStation 2

597
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:57,220
2. Of course, you could think of this as kind of like Final Fantasy Tactics, but... Sweet

598
00:36:57,220 --> 00:37:01,160
Golden Tactics! The official announcement came out this week that it will be coming

599
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:07,160
out for the PlayStation 2. We're looking at a Spring 2006 release date for this game.

600
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:12,360
Okay, did you... you remember Advent Rising, that game that was... came out for the Xbox

601
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:15,780
recently? You know how they had that million dollar competition that was going on? Win

602
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:20,200
a million dollars by playing Advent Rising? Yeah. Called off! The competition has been

603
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:27,200
called off due to too many bugs going on with the game, or basically also they're saying

604
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:32,440
too many bugs, too many things going wrong in the system, they have quietly cancelled

605
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,580
the million dollar giveaway.

606
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:35,080
That happened earlier this week.

607
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:40,380
Instead, as kind of a consolation prize, each person who participated in the Race to Save

608
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:45,440
Humanity contest will receive two free games from its recent catalog.

609
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:49,920
Not too bad of a consolation prize when you consider that the games you can choose from

610
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:56,540
Blood Rain 2, Guilty Gear X2 Reload, Psychonauts, Raze as Hell, and Phantom Dust.

611
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:59,560
So there's quite a few good games in that catalog there.

612
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:04,840
Too bad though about that million dollar competition because they stand to be paying that much

613
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,320
out in all these free games.

614
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:09,060
I don't know how many people were in this contest.

615
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:12,280
This really wasn't a game that appealed to me personally, but I just think it's interesting

616
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,040
that the contest had to be called off.

617
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:16,640
It was a cool game, but it did have its fair share of bugs.

618
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,520
Yeah, it's too bad.

619
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,520
Alright.

620
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:26,040
Um, also, I want to point this out, World of Warcraft, you know this, the MMO, the most

621
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:33,880
popular MMO, which none of us play here on this program, I actually, I have a friend

622
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:37,480
that's really trying to get me into it too, I've tried to install it, and my computer

623
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:40,760
won't accept the installation for some reason, which makes no sense to me.

624
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,760
It's like, no!

625
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,760
No, I don't want this!

626
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:47,720
already put enough crappy MMOs on me so I'm trying to make it work so we will

627
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:52,520
soon be reporting from inside World of Warcraft at some point hopefully but we

628
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:57,280
did want to point out upper deck entertainment what is upper deck well

629
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:02,920
known for card cards that's right they are making a they are making a trading

630
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:09,680
card game based out of World of Warcraft the quote from Jerry Benton senior vice

631
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:13,800
president of Upper Deck Entertainment, the World of Warcraft trading card game will perfectly

632
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:18,700
capture all of the action-packed combat and furious competition that online players have

633
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:19,700
come to expect.

634
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:20,700
Will there be a slash...

635
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:22,180
Oh, wait, no, that's EverQuest II.

636
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:23,420
That's EverQuest II.

637
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:24,420
Slash pizza card.

638
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:25,420
That'd be sweet.

639
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:26,420
Maybe the pizza card.

640
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:31,460
You know, actually, I think it was in World of Warcraft, there's slash chicken you can

641
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:37,260
do, and you can do this little quest where you can get a chicken to follow you around.

642
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:38,260
Interesting.

643
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:39,260
Very interesting.

644
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:43,900
Xbox 360, this is actually really big news, we're hitting it kind of late in the podcast,

645
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:45,260
my bad.

646
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:52,700
Prices were announced this week for the Xbox 360, very interesting, $299.99 US for the

647
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:53,700
basic unit.

648
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:56,440
I don't know why they just don't say 300 bucks, because that's what you're going to be paying

649
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,220
after tax, 300 bucks.

650
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:04,080
So for 300 bucks, you're going to get the Xbox 360 console, the controller, which is

651
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:06,980
a wired controller, but it has an extended nine foot cable.

652
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:10,360
Which I didn't understand anyways because there's no freaking controller ports on there

653
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:16,220
So where you plug it in? They're all now a new game find the controller for a USB port maybe and whatever

654
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:22,440
Huh, maybe gotcha. All right an Xbox 360 faceplate and an Xbox 360

655
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:27,560
Standard AV cable. All right composite. Yeah, so that's the first one

656
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,500
now if you want a

657
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:33,620
$400 or as they say three ninety nine ninety nine

658
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:39,620
That's just $400 and that first set the first one was actually called the Xbox 360 core. Yes

659
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:43,000
That's just the Xbox 360 basically now. This is the premium edition

660
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,700
400 bucks

661
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:47,700
console hard drive

662
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:55,580
20 gigabytes yes, ladies and gentlemen the Xbox 360 will not have a hard drive built in by default like the original Xbox did

663
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:57,580
You know what I'm doing. I'm gonna take that friggin hard drive

664
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:02,700
I'm ripping apart and put 120 gig hard drive in there screw that 20 gig crap for the $400

665
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:10,560
you get the wireless controller, the faceplate, a headset, a component high definition cable,

666
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:18,300
so you, well let me get to that thought, Xbox Live silver, yes, an Xbox Live silver membership,

667
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:21,080
and a bonus media remote.

668
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:26,020
So basically, those of you guys that are HDTV owners like myself now, I just bought one

669
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:30,320
not that long ago and Jamie I know has got one, you're pretty much screwed because once

670
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:37,640
Once you buy the $300 Xbox and the correct cable, you're gonna be paying $400 as it is.

671
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:45,360
So it seems to me that this $300 leftovers pack is kind of trying to soften the blow

672
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:48,920
of the fact that the system really costs $400 for everything you want.

673
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:49,920
Yeah, what they're...

674
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,320
I'm thinking what people are gonna do is be buying that when the third party stuff starts

675
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,320
coming out.

676
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,320
Possibly.

677
00:41:55,320 --> 00:42:12,320
You don't have to buy a hard drive, you can buy this stupid little 64 meg memory card thing, and you don't have to buy a wireless controller, I mean, it's just nice, and you don't have to have a headset, and guess what, you know, the Xbox Live Silver package, that's free, so that's not really a big...

678
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:21,320
Well that actually is packaged in on the regular one too, I know it didn't make the story here on the site, but I read it somewhere else that the Xbox Live Silver will be on both sets, so at least you get that.

679
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,320
What would you do?

680
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:28,020
What strikes me as interesting though, okay, I maybe understand why they omitted the hard drive from the Xbox 360,

681
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:31,620
because honestly, how often did you use it with the original Xbox?

682
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:36,820
Granted, you could load your own songs, but how many games really supported that? Not a lot.

683
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:43,120
I don't know, we put on a bunch of Initial D soundtracks for, what was it, Midnight Club or something?

684
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:46,620
Yeah, but not a lot of games supported it.

685
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:48,220
I mean, a few, but not a lot.

686
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:51,820
and it's not like you could, a lot of games

687
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:56,460
use the hard drive for their data, I mean it's saved but nothing that a memory card

688
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:59,100
wouldn't be able to fit unless you're a real hardcore gamer

689
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:05,060
but now I'm thinking okay but now you're also talking with Xbox 360 that

690
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:07,660
Final Fantasy 11 is one of your big titles

691
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:11,800
you have to have a hard drive for Final Fantasy 11 because of all the freaking patches they do

692
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:15,460
so if you want to play Final Fantasy 11, Sony had their hand in that little decision

693
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:17,460
Yeah, well, yeah, most likely so

694
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:20,420
Just very interesting there that

695
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:25,700
Really to play all the really big games. You're gonna have to check down the $400 anyway

696
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:30,900
I suppose maybe if you just want you just want Madden, you know, you're just a light gamer

697
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:37,540
Maybe the $300 one will do you but most people that listen to this program probably consider themselves hardcore enough where?

698
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:39,900
That $300 set just doesn't cut it

699
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:41,740
so

700
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:46,440
Very interesting a dark soccer any other thoughts on that. Oh, yeah

701
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:47,800
I know I'm gonna have to get the premium

702
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:51,720
I have to I want the HD cables and I want the wireless controller and the hard drive

703
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:55,400
So I have to check down the $400, but I'm just kind of

704
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:05,360
Well, I guess but $400 is still a lot of money but I suppose most systems were around $400 when they first came out anyway, so

705
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:11,280
Did you know that they lost a lot of money when the Xbox first came out? Yeah

706
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:15,620
I think this is a way for them to make something that looks a little bit more affordable and

707
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:20,860
attractive for the casual gamer or for someone who doesn't have a lot of money or doesn't

708
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:25,460
have, you know, the high definition setup you or I have.

709
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:29,600
It makes it a little bit more affordable, makes it a little bit more attractive, and

710
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:34,720
then for those of us who have all this stuff who would lay down that kind of money, you

711
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:37,800
know, they're like, hey, we've got some goodies for you, we'll save you some money.

712
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:41,400
I suppose what makes some of us angsty out there is that we're looking at this

713
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:41,840
going,

714
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:46,200
aw man, you mean we gotta pay a hundred dollars for the stuff we need anyway

715
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:49,720
as gamers? I think that's where we kinda feel like, aw

716
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:53,100
jeez, we're being nickeled and dimed again. But I understand what you're saying. By

717
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:54,640
having the three hundred dollar set,

718
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:58,000
it makes Xbox 360 more accessible,

719
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,000
so to speak, to a broader game audience. Those folks that, you know, they just want

720
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,200
the new Madden game or,

721
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:06,880
you know, whatever it is. I think it's a really smart move on

722
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,560
on Microsoft's part, I really do.

723
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,680
Well, we shall see when the sales figures come out,

724
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:12,000
shall we?

725
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,040
Oh, yes, I will be paying attention to that.

726
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:20,920
I read a really neat article in Time about the 360.

727
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:24,880
This article came out about the time that we were all at E3.

728
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:28,440
I'm just saying about how much money they lost on it.

729
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:31,000
With the design of the system, they

730
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,120
designed something that would be attractive

731
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:35,400
to the Japanese market as well.

732
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:38,720
now i'd love to see if they're going to be doing the same thing there that they

733
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:41,600
are here

734
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:42,760
what's that

735
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:46,120
about having the multiple packages

736
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:49,420
okay the with and without package basically

737
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:50,020
we'll see

738
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:52,840
we gotta move on let's get to some more stories uh... loki you got anything else for us?

739
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:55,920
yeah speaking of xbox 360 there's a

740
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:56,800
some of

741
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,360
few little things here

742
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:00,680
one of them is this new

743
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:05,120
webpage that's just appeared online and this webpage is

744
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:09,060
xbox or its origin xbox

745
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:10,880
three sixty dot com

746
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:14,380
what's interesting is there's a new timer counting down there was also

747
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:15,680
interesting is

748
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:19,700
that the domain was registered by microsoft

749
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:22,180
so it is in another one of those big like you know when

750
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:26,320
we like bees or whatever that site was called

751
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:31,440
possibly uh... the website by you know people looking at it they figured out

752
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:32,740
that's gonna end

753
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:33,760
on

754
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:42,600
September 27th, I believe at 12 Eastern, and no one really knows what the hell it is, they

755
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:44,260
just know that it's a countdown thing.

756
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:49,000
It's got this, kind of a picture of a tree, and it's cut out of a bunny, and it looks

757
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,840
like Xbox 360 will have bunny love.

758
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:53,520
Ah, bunnies.

759
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:58,160
No, but that's their answer to Nintendogs.

760
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:01,860
Micro bunnies.

761
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:02,860
That's it.

762
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:07,160
now but you know something like that could actually happen. You know something like that

763
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:10,640
could actually happen. It will be there answered in Nintendogs. It will be micro bunnies. Yeah,

764
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:14,640
you micro bunnies. You walk, you turn around, you walk away, you get something to drink,

765
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:19,580
you come back, there's 400 of them on the screen. And what are we going to get next,

766
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:27,060
play cats? Oh god, anyway, so there's some weird site and it's basically you can access

767
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:37,580
it at www.origin and this is o-r-i-g-n-x-box-360.com and you've got the countdown here you can

768
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:45,420
go check it out figure out what it's about who knows kind of weird but anyways then on

769
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:52,620
to the subject of something else which would be the nintendo d or actually nintendo revolution

770
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:59,820
There has been a comment made by Peter Mullinux at Lionhead Studios, the guy, or the studio

771
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:07,500
behind Black and White and Fable, and he's basically quizzed at the, at some European

772
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:13,700
games convention about the revolution, and he's basically said this, and this is his

773
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:19,540
quote, there is a line at the end of the book, game over, and it is, never underestimate

774
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:25,840
Nintendo that is all I can say about the controller hmm things that make you go

775
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:29,680
hmm basically you know what it's been the same thing from all these other

776
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:33,040
different publishers have been looking at they're like I can't say anything

777
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:38,360
under strict you know NDR but don't count them out interesting so we'll have

778
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:41,880
to wait till the end of the year to find out you know the Nintendo's kind of been

779
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:47,940
with the DS they kind of changed the controller a little bit because the

780
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:51,380
controller is a pen and you never really saw that in a gaming system before so

781
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:54,460
Nintendo's kind of been on this kick lately so it'll be very interesting to

782
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:57,020
see what happens

783
00:48:57,020 --> 00:49:03,860
God no power glove it's so bad all right anything else you got for us

784
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:09,940
tonight Loki and finally yes happy birthday to you happy birthday Mario

785
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:17,020
you're 20 Wow he's still young and yeah he's got a lot to learn Nintendo has

786
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:21,420
officially launched the Mario's happy birthday site,

787
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:26,900
nintendo.co.jp slash mario20th.

788
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:29,140
And on behalf of Orange Lounge Radio,

789
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:30,940
we'd like to apologize to Mario.

790
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:35,900
We are sorry, but your cake is in another castle.

791
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:37,100
I kill me.

792
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:39,540
It's a mushroom cake.

793
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:42,020
Digdug is coming to the DS.

794
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:44,020
We mentioned this on the show a little bit ago,

795
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:46,540
but now they're releasing a little bit more information

796
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:52,500
about this game. It's Dig Dug Digging Strike. It's going to be an update of the 82 game

797
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:58,060
Dig Dug. It will be coming out this fall, says Namco. The DS game will have the original

798
00:49:58,060 --> 00:50:02,380
character from Dig Dug and will also have updated gameplay that takes advantage of the

799
00:50:02,380 --> 00:50:07,500
dual screens on the handheld. It'll actually be coming out in September. Dig Dug, oh you

800
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:12,940
know the release date for this? It's mid-September. Dig Dug is armed with a collection of weapons

801
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:18,420
such as rocks, lava, and quicksand to defeat the baddies that are in his way.

802
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:20,220
So that should be interesting.

803
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:21,220
Also multiplayer.

804
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:23,940
This is junior assistant Mr. Driller.

805
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:27,540
They are saying multiplayer, two players, in this game.

806
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:28,540
So it should be interesting.

807
00:50:28,540 --> 00:50:30,280
That'll be really cool.

808
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:31,280
Did you have any other stories for us tonight?

809
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:32,280
I happen to have that.

810
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:33,280
I'm sorry?

811
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:41,460
I have to have that game actually, I picked up Dig Dug for the Atari 7800 today.

812
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:48,060
DS is more than making up for kind of a light early 2005 with a lot of great games in late

813
00:50:48,060 --> 00:50:49,660
2005, so I forgive them.

814
00:50:49,660 --> 00:50:52,900
I still do not forgive them for the Zelda delay, however.

815
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:55,300
Did you have any other stories for us tonight, Dark Sakura?

816
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:56,300
Nope.

817
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:57,300
Okay.

818
00:50:57,300 --> 00:50:59,140
Then I've only got a couple more left here.

819
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:03,260
These are kind of the WTF stories.

820
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:04,860
Core Hotels.

821
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:09,220
This is a hotel chain in Southern California, and it's one of those like really swanky hotel

822
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:10,220
things.

823
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:16,240
a PlayStation 2 and PSP basically what it is is that you if you stay in their

824
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:22,520
rooms you get free use of a PSP handheld or a PlayStation 2 get this each hotel

825
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:27,160
has a resident game butler who helps you install and use the systems how would

826
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:31,440
that be for a job being the game butler one of these hotels very interesting by

827
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:34,640
the way if you're me yeah if you're thinking that this is a good way to

828
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:39,000
check out one of these systems think again because staying at core hotels

829
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:43,440
will cost you well over several hundred dollars per night so you might as well

830
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:50,760
just buy yourself a PlayStation 2 or a PSP. I can top that. Oh? What do you have?

831
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:57,320
It's just been announced that... I've got one more story and it's all right no no

832
00:51:57,320 --> 00:52:02,160
I want to save mine for last because mine's great you read yours. Well you

833
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:07,800
know Nokia will just try anything to get their product out there so Nokia to

834
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:14,720
Combat, you know the PSP being a hotel. They have the Nokia engage deck chair. That's right folks the engage deck chair

835
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:19,280
What you can do basically is they're gonna be putting these out at

836
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:22,560
different venues out there and

837
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:27,920
What's gonna happen is is they're actually gonna be sitting I

838
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:33,280
Honestly like a chair with a chair with a crappy umbrella attached to it

839
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:37,280
And this crappy N-Gage attached to it, it looks like crap.

840
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:39,960
It's just, it's going to be touring a number of festivals,

841
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:47,760
including Carlene Leeds and Reading Festival and whatever.

842
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:51,160
Honestly, folks, it's going to suck.

843
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:54,000
The last desperate attempt of a desperate company.

844
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,120
Even the deck chair looks uncomfortable.

845
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:58,240
It's like the deck chair was put together wrong.

846
00:52:58,240 --> 00:52:58,760
You know what's funny?

847
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:02,760
I went to IHOP today, and I saw somebody playing an N-Gage.

848
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:06,600
and that's probably only the second time I have ever seen somebody playing an

849
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:09,600
N-Gage. Their parents don't love them. No, it was like an adult.

850
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:12,680
Like an upper-twenties looking guy.

851
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:16,180
And it's probably only the second time I've ever seen somebody playing an N-Gage, like not

852
00:53:16,180 --> 00:53:19,480
in a GameStop demo or something. Crazy.

853
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:22,800
You know what, in the N-Gage's defense,

854
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:26,560
a system is only as good as the games that are on it.

855
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:29,560
Unfortunately it doesn't really have any good games anyway.

856
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:33,720
yeah all right now dark soccer you tell me which story was better Loki's final

857
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:35,120
story or my final story

858
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:40,580
Linda Carter will be joining the cast of Elder Scrolls 4

859
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:46,240
Linda Carter yes that's right Linda Carter best known as Wonder Woman

860
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:50,700
or should I say Wonder Woman is going to be joining the cast of this game Elder

861
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:51,560
Scrolls 4

862
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:54,600
and what else do you really need to know about the game

863
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:57,520
I mean seriously it's got Wonder Woman in it who cares

864
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:01,320
all right fine it's freaking awesome it's it's

865
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:04,240
it's you know a role-playing game basically um

866
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:07,360
it you're in this fantasy realm of Tamriel

867
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:10,840
where the gates to a hellish underworld are going to be opened and

868
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:14,600
but never fear Wonder Woman is here! but never fear Wonder Woman's here with her

869
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:16,520
golden lasso

870
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:19,840
all right you know what

871
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:24,520
Wonder Woman was created by the guy who invented the

872
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:28,600
the lie detector. I've heard that story before.

873
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:31,880
And the golden lasso is a

874
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:35,400
sort of a nod to his invention. That's great.

875
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:38,900
Of course he was also into bondage, which explains other things.

876
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:42,520
And of course there's the upcoming Wonder Woman movie that's

877
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:46,120
going to be directed by the guy who did Buffy and Serenity and all that stuff,

878
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:49,720
but that's for another podcast. Wait, is it directed by or is it written by?

879
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:52,760
I believe... Written by Joss.

880
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:58,760
Don't send me hate mail if I'm wrong, but I believe it's written and directed by the one and only Jaws.

881
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:04,760
That means it's going to be done fabulously well. He was also writing X-Men for a little while.

882
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:06,760
And it was being done very well.

883
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:11,760
We'll save that to the Buffy fans podcast. If there is one, I would think there's got to be a Buffy podcast out there.

884
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:13,760
I'm going to go look for one right now.

885
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:15,760
That sounds like a waste of time.

886
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:22,920
It's time for the final thoughts before DarkSakura jumps through the skype line and strangles

887
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:25,200
Loki for knocking Buffy.

888
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:26,200
Loki your final thought.

889
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:31,760
Did that guy actually come up with the really retarded concept of an invisible flying jet?

890
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:32,760
Yep.

891
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:36,080
Why couldn't he just make her fly?

892
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:39,360
An invisible jet is retarded.

893
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:41,480
Because she's an Amazon or something.

894
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:43,680
Oh so she can't fly.

895
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:46,320
She's a woman, that's why she can't fly.

896
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:47,320
Hey!

897
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:50,480
She has some fly jets.

898
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:51,480
She's going to punch you next week.

899
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:53,560
I'm just saying that because I'm not there.

900
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:59,160
My final thought is, my final thought is Nintendogs, you are mine this week, finally.

901
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:02,280
Oh god, it's going to be a really bad show next week.

902
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:04,680
It's always a really bad show, what are you talking about?

903
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:06,240
But you guys listen anyway, we love you.

904
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:09,800
DarkSakura, your final thought?

905
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:11,240
Reject false icons.

906
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:12,240
Alright.

907
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:18,200
That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio To Go, thanks you guys

908
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:20,200
for subscribing and listening. Have a great night.
