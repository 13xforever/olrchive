[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of August 22nd, 2005.

2
00:00:03,992 --> 00:00:15,722
[SPEAKER_03]: You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.

3
00:00:15,962 --> 00:00:19,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.

4
00:00:20,905 --> 00:00:22,786
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, everybody.

5
00:00:22,947 --> 00:00:32,474
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome once again to another edition of Orange Lounge Radio To Go, that podcast dedicated to video games that don't suck.

6
00:00:32,834 --> 00:00:33,795
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Rob Roberts.

7
00:00:33,835 --> 00:00:35,136
[SPEAKER_05]: You might know me as Sky.

8
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:47,064
[SPEAKER_05]: Joining us via Skype tonight, and I know that we say we usually don't do the co-host over Skype, but, you know, we can't help cases of sickness or injury, and that's what the one and only DarkSakura is facing tonight.

9
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:49,146
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, DarkSakura on the Skype tonight.

10
00:00:50,109 --> 00:00:51,911
[SPEAKER_01]: Yo, what's going on?

11
00:00:51,951 --> 00:00:52,591
[SPEAKER_05]: What happened?

12
00:00:52,611 --> 00:00:53,212
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you okay?

13
00:00:54,193 --> 00:01:09,746
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I was covering Classic Gaming Expo for us today, and I guess it was a combination of walking around and the driving and then just sitting still practically with my leg extended, but my hip flared up really bad, so I'm sort of hyped up on Vicodin tonight.

14
00:01:10,146 --> 00:01:13,068
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, so we can't have her driving over to the studio when she's on Vicodin.

15
00:01:13,709 --> 00:01:16,171
[SPEAKER_05]: But you've got to tell us a little bit about Classic Gaming Expo tonight.

16
00:01:17,715 --> 00:01:19,496
[SPEAKER_01]: It was about the same as it was last year.

17
00:01:19,556 --> 00:01:21,716
[SPEAKER_01]: They had more games that actually worked.

18
00:01:23,477 --> 00:01:25,318
[SPEAKER_01]: Had my picture taken by a millipede.

19
00:01:25,358 --> 00:01:27,398
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll be somewhere on our site eventually.

20
00:01:29,259 --> 00:01:33,620
[SPEAKER_01]: Got to meet some pretty cool people, including the guys who do retro gaming radio.

21
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,341
[SPEAKER_01]: They're pretty cool.

22
00:01:35,681 --> 00:01:40,162
[SPEAKER_01]: And got to just see all kinds of stuff.

23
00:01:40,182 --> 00:01:41,563
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought Famicom games today.

24
00:01:42,223 --> 00:01:42,803
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, very cool.

25
00:01:42,843 --> 00:01:44,684
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the original Japanese Nintendo games.

26
00:01:45,774 --> 00:01:47,075
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought Final Fantasy 2.

27
00:01:48,135 --> 00:01:48,515
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.

28
00:01:49,395 --> 00:01:51,736
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got Final Fantasy 5 for Super Famicom.

29
00:01:51,756 --> 00:01:53,917
[SPEAKER_01]: I got Mappyland for Famicom.

30
00:01:53,937 --> 00:01:56,558
[SPEAKER_01]: I got some PC Engine hue cards.

31
00:01:56,618 --> 00:01:59,339
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually got a PC Engine core graphics today.

32
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:04,261
[SPEAKER_01]: And just some other little bits and pieces that I'll have pictures of shortly.

33
00:02:04,721 --> 00:02:05,481
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, sounds good.

34
00:02:05,742 --> 00:02:09,623
[SPEAKER_05]: How did you think this year's Classic Gaming Expo compared to previous years that you've been to?

35
00:02:10,863 --> 00:02:11,944
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really...

36
00:02:13,075 --> 00:02:13,716
[SPEAKER_01]: It was empty.

37
00:02:13,756 --> 00:02:26,649
[SPEAKER_01]: Then again, we did go on second day toward the end, but there was just an emptiness I felt to it, which is probably a good idea they're taking next year off because I'm hoping the one in 2007 is going to be fantastic.

38
00:02:26,709 --> 00:02:28,931
[SPEAKER_01]: It's supposed to be their anniversary.

39
00:02:30,332 --> 00:02:30,673
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, very cool.

40
00:02:30,693 --> 00:02:31,814
[SPEAKER_01]: Their, I think, 10th anniversary.

41
00:02:31,994 --> 00:02:32,414
[SPEAKER_05]: Very cool.

42
00:02:32,434 --> 00:02:35,858
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm hoping it's big and maybe, you know,

43
00:02:36,286 --> 00:02:38,526
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe if it works out, we can get in on that.

44
00:02:38,646 --> 00:02:41,167
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I definitely want to check it out when it comes back.

45
00:02:41,187 --> 00:02:43,227
[SPEAKER_05]: And they always have a really good show at E3 as well.

46
00:02:43,267 --> 00:02:45,228
[SPEAKER_05]: I like the concept of Classic Gaming Expo.

47
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:50,008
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully a year off, we'll just recharge them a little bit and they'll be good to go in 2007.

48
00:02:50,509 --> 00:02:51,809
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm looking forward to that, definitely.

49
00:02:52,729 --> 00:02:53,969
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, 8-Bit Weapon was back.

50
00:02:54,289 --> 00:02:54,809
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, how were they?

51
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,550
[SPEAKER_01]: They were awesome as always.

52
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:03,571
[SPEAKER_01]: And another guy was there as part of the convention playing music on a keyboard.

53
00:03:03,671 --> 00:03:04,231
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty cool stuff.

54
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:04,760
[SPEAKER_05]: Not really.

55
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:07,342
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, there were people who were doing new prototypes.

56
00:03:07,362 --> 00:03:07,502
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh-huh.

57
00:03:31,038 --> 00:03:34,081
[SPEAKER_01]: But nothing, you know, there was the Intellivision people were there again.

58
00:03:34,321 --> 00:03:34,561
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

59
00:03:35,342 --> 00:03:47,093
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a guy, he said it's actually someone in Brazil makes these, but they take the MSX games, like the Metal Gear and the original Metal Gear 2 were on MSX, as was the Guardian Legend, it was called Guardia.

60
00:03:47,413 --> 00:03:48,014
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, cool.

61
00:03:48,054 --> 00:03:52,278
[SPEAKER_01]: They were all MSX games, and they have them remade to play on the ColecoVision.

62
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:54,200
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, wow.

63
00:03:55,071 --> 00:04:00,094
[SPEAKER_01]: That was neat, but there wasn't anything really new there.

64
00:04:00,254 --> 00:04:02,796
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing like what Gradius V was last year.

65
00:04:04,037 --> 00:04:10,601
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well, we'll look forward to more reports on Classic Gaming Expo on our website, www.orangeloungeradio.com.

66
00:04:10,661 --> 00:04:15,244
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura's picture collection will be posted sometime during the week, so we look forward to that.

67
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:21,628
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I haven't forgotten, four minutes into the show, but I haven't forgotten the one and only TechMassaLoki over there in studio tonight.

68
00:04:21,908 --> 00:04:22,969
[SPEAKER_05]: I wasn't even like

69
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:23,761
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura

70
00:04:36,623 --> 00:04:38,465
[SPEAKER_05]: So let DarkSakura do a little report there.

71
00:04:38,485 --> 00:04:41,287
[SPEAKER_05]: Why don't you give us one of your stories you're looking at tonight from the hack and crack scene.

72
00:04:42,107 --> 00:04:45,690
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, my report, I was just kind of browsing stuff.

73
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:49,733
[SPEAKER_04]: One of them is a mod for Half-Life 2 called Half-Life 2 Fueled.

74
00:04:50,413 --> 00:05:00,280
[SPEAKER_04]: And because Half-Life 2 is famous for its ragdoll physics and playing with the ragdoll physics, they have some really kick-ass shots from this.

75
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:05,884
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like, you know, for example, tons of cars just all strewn about the place and

76
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:08,940
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like it's going to be pretty cool.

77
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,701
[SPEAKER_04]: They've got some ramps in this little demo thing here.

78
00:05:11,721 --> 00:05:19,263
[SPEAKER_04]: You can find out more about it on www.fueledmod.com And they've got some interesting stuff on there.

79
00:05:19,543 --> 00:05:21,484
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, cool.

80
00:05:22,184 --> 00:05:30,407
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well now what I want to do is I want to go ahead and start off tonight's show, even though we had a couple stories there, to start off tonight's show talking about what we like to always start off the show talking about.

81
00:05:30,727 --> 00:05:33,268
[SPEAKER_05]: What games have we, the hosts, been playing this week?

82
00:05:33,828 --> 00:05:35,789
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, what have you been playing this week in your gaming world?

83
00:05:37,506 --> 00:05:52,790
[SPEAKER_01]: well seeing as how I started school this week I haven't had a whole bunch of time and I actually am going to be signing back up for Ragnarok Online again it's funny you should talk about signing up for old MMOs you're not signing back up for Final Fantasy XI are you?

84
00:05:53,931 --> 00:06:06,094
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't say I'm not going to I'm going to give Ragnarok a try for a month to see if I really miss it as badly as I think I do

85
00:06:06,696 --> 00:06:08,737
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my philosophy on Final Fantasy as well.

86
00:06:09,697 --> 00:06:14,200
[SPEAKER_01]: But they have like a pay $7 for 30 hours of gameplay, so I'm going to give that a go.

87
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:15,520
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, sounds good.

88
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,201
[SPEAKER_01]: Just for a month.

89
00:06:17,441 --> 00:06:24,845
[SPEAKER_01]: I hunted down the Vetrex, and then I remembered why I don't play the Vetrex, because it kind of gave me a headache.

90
00:06:25,085 --> 00:06:27,086
[SPEAKER_05]: But the Vetrex was just a cool idea, really.

91
00:06:28,586 --> 00:06:30,187
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, true.

92
00:06:30,987 --> 00:06:31,428
[SPEAKER_01]: I also...

93
00:06:33,584 --> 00:06:36,645
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried out a couple of Hu cards at Classic Gaming Expo today.

94
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:41,486
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I also watched Dan try out some of the ones that we bought.

95
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:42,587
[SPEAKER_01]: We got Sun Sun 2.

96
00:06:42,667 --> 00:06:43,567
[SPEAKER_01]: That game is cool.

97
00:06:44,287 --> 00:06:45,807
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, I don't even think I've heard of that.

98
00:06:45,907 --> 00:06:50,489
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, okay, I have heard of that, but that's a, wow, that's an obscure game.

99
00:06:51,429 --> 00:06:52,469
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, pretty obscure.

100
00:06:52,989 --> 00:06:54,610
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of stuff at Classic Gaming Expo is obscure.

101
00:06:55,077 --> 00:06:58,300
[SPEAKER_01]: Legend of the Valkyrie Loki, what games have you been playing this week?

102
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,624
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been playing pretty much the same stuff I was playing last week.

103
00:07:01,644 --> 00:07:01,824
[SPEAKER_05]: I played

104
00:07:18,578 --> 00:07:20,399
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

105
00:07:45,995 --> 00:07:48,496
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Taiko Drum Master here in the US, of course.

106
00:07:49,016 --> 00:07:50,917
[SPEAKER_05]: That's got to be weird on the PSP, though.

107
00:07:51,417 --> 00:07:52,357
[SPEAKER_05]: It works really good, actually.

108
00:07:52,377 --> 00:08:01,040
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of looked over your shoulder while you were playing it, and it looks really crisp, and it's just like the PlayStation 2 version right on your little PSP.

109
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,381
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's really good, and it's pretty fun.

110
00:08:03,481 --> 00:08:09,002
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wish it was in English, so I'd be able to understand what menus were and stuff, because it's a pain in the ass.

111
00:08:09,423 --> 00:08:14,124
[SPEAKER_04]: But someone did make some on GameFAQs, I think, English translations of the menus, so

112
00:08:14,656 --> 00:08:15,156
[SPEAKER_04]: That helps.

113
00:08:15,376 --> 00:08:15,976
[SPEAKER_04]: That's always helpful.

114
00:08:16,136 --> 00:08:16,297
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

115
00:08:16,477 --> 00:08:18,257
[SPEAKER_04]: Those game fact people are always very helpful.

116
00:08:18,377 --> 00:08:20,138
[SPEAKER_04]: It is, but you know what they could help me out with?

117
00:08:20,238 --> 00:08:25,520
[SPEAKER_04]: Some cheats from freaking Burnout 3, because I've got to play through these races, and I'm not liking that.

118
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,320
[SPEAKER_04]: I need my fast cars now.

119
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,961
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

120
00:08:30,001 --> 00:08:32,142
[SPEAKER_05]: My gaming week... Is that all you've had?

121
00:08:32,322 --> 00:08:33,002
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's all I have.

122
00:08:33,042 --> 00:08:33,242
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

123
00:08:33,622 --> 00:08:38,024
[SPEAKER_05]: My gaming week has consisted of my... Well, I was sick this week, actually.

124
00:08:38,064 --> 00:08:38,984
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie has...

125
00:08:39,525 --> 00:08:40,046
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

126
00:08:58,107 --> 00:09:01,889
[SPEAKER_05]: I've had a Japanese one for years to get my music gaming fix out of the way.

127
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:06,412
[SPEAKER_05]: But since I was living with Loki for such a long time, he had an American PlayStation 2.

128
00:09:07,712 --> 00:09:11,494
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't have a need for my own, so I finally went and bought one on Saturday.

129
00:09:11,594 --> 00:09:14,256
[SPEAKER_05]: I bought one of the little chibi miniature ones.

130
00:09:14,516 --> 00:09:20,639
[SPEAKER_05]: I really hadn't seen one because everybody else I know got their PlayStation 2s years ago, so they're huge.

131
00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:23,061
[SPEAKER_05]: So I hadn't really seen the tiny ones up close.

132
00:09:23,701 --> 00:09:25,582
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn, those are tiny PlayStations!

133
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:31,644
[SPEAKER_05]: I could have just loaned you mine indefinitely since I have Final Fantasy X International And you're playing it half the hassle

134
00:09:54,953 --> 00:09:56,033
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, my headset moved back.

135
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:56,533
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's all right.

136
00:09:56,553 --> 00:09:57,694
[SPEAKER_00]: Knowing it's half the hassle.

137
00:09:59,614 --> 00:09:59,894
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

138
00:10:00,594 --> 00:10:09,436
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, also, I bought the PlayStation 2 so that I could, you know, screen new games if we start getting any screeners.

139
00:10:10,196 --> 00:10:12,796
[SPEAKER_05]: I should say additional screeners from, like, you know, media companies and stuff.

140
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:13,956
[SPEAKER_05]: I do have demos at work.

141
00:10:13,996 --> 00:10:14,796
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't brought them in though.

142
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:16,177
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so we'll start taking a look at those.

143
00:10:16,637 --> 00:10:21,658
[SPEAKER_05]: And as well as, you know, just renting some games and checking things out so I can keep a tab on what's going on.

144
00:10:22,098 --> 00:10:23,398
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, other than the PlayStation 2, as...

145
00:10:24,431 --> 00:10:25,251
[SPEAKER_05]: People are cultists.

146
00:10:25,271 --> 00:10:25,571
[SPEAKER_05]: I escaped.

147
00:10:25,611 --> 00:10:26,192
[SPEAKER_05]: I escaped.

148
00:10:51,912 --> 00:10:57,634
[SPEAKER_05]: You sure did, but you're in Ragnarok, which is, you know, some people would say just as bad.

149
00:10:58,315 --> 00:11:02,936
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, I've been in Ragnarok for like, what, five years, six years?

150
00:11:03,156 --> 00:11:05,077
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, well, you're still getting quiet there.

151
00:11:05,097 --> 00:11:06,678
[SPEAKER_05]: My addiction is stronger than your addiction.

152
00:11:06,698 --> 00:11:08,559
[SPEAKER_05]: You're a little quiet there, DarkSakura.

153
00:11:08,899 --> 00:11:10,880
[SPEAKER_01]: My addiction is stronger than your addiction.

154
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,561
[SPEAKER_01]: My addiction is mighty, and to be feared.

155
00:11:15,953 --> 00:11:17,896
[SPEAKER_05]: Zelda Twilight Princess got the big ol' delay to Spring 2006

156
00:11:29,181 --> 00:11:58,256
[SPEAKER_05]: and of course the question heard around the world what the hell Nintendo what the hell you had this game ready to show us at E3 and we thought you were all ready to go in the fall but now they're saying no we need more time we're announcing a new global launch in 2006 after the conclusion of the fiscal year so no earlier than April 1st we'll provide a specific date at a later point in time while this may come as a disappointment it will absolutely enrich the game and make it a multi-million seller

157
00:11:59,163 --> 00:11:59,804
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know about that.

158
00:11:59,864 --> 00:12:01,005
[SPEAKER_05]: It would have been that anyways.

159
00:12:01,925 --> 00:12:02,306
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

160
00:12:02,706 --> 00:12:03,767
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that means Rob.

161
00:12:04,067 --> 00:12:04,287
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

162
00:12:05,008 --> 00:12:06,229
[SPEAKER_01]: Birthday present for me.

163
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:09,611
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, hopefully it's released around your birthday.

164
00:12:09,691 --> 00:12:15,516
[SPEAKER_05]: But the reason why they say they're doing this is because they're adding extra things to it.

165
00:12:16,016 --> 00:12:16,397
[SPEAKER_05]: Who knows?

166
00:12:16,437 --> 00:12:17,597
[SPEAKER_05]: The game could be buggy as hell.

167
00:12:17,638 --> 00:12:19,579
[SPEAKER_05]: Who really knows why this game got pushed back?

168
00:12:19,619 --> 00:12:22,681
[SPEAKER_05]: But what they're saying is that they're trying to add new things to it.

169
00:12:23,122 --> 00:12:25,804
[SPEAKER_05]: Which I suppose is good news, but at the same time...

170
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:29,922
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not like there's been a flood of GameCube games lately.

171
00:12:29,962 --> 00:12:32,983
[SPEAKER_05]: They really should have been working on this double time a while ago.

172
00:12:33,864 --> 00:12:37,606
[SPEAKER_01]: What we've got is a bunch of game testers going, but I haven't beaten it yet!

173
00:12:37,726 --> 00:12:38,406
[SPEAKER_01]: Delay!

174
00:12:40,367 --> 00:12:40,847
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe.

175
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:43,589
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be a good news thing, though, because that means the game is long.

176
00:12:44,349 --> 00:12:46,770
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully, it'll be a good thing, but I don't know.

177
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:49,752
[SPEAKER_05]: Does it affect your feelings about the game at all, this delay?

178
00:12:53,304 --> 00:13:02,530
[SPEAKER_05]: for me, I will probably still pick it up but I'm not I feel like by the time it comes out I will feel like, oh, this is yesterday's game

179
00:13:03,362 --> 00:13:03,902
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

180
00:13:28,223 --> 00:13:31,707
[SPEAKER_01]: yes, a game is only as good as how it plays

181
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,661
[SPEAKER_04]: Another delay that pisses the hell out of me.

182
00:13:45,181 --> 00:13:50,623
[SPEAKER_04]: Final Fantasy Advent Children is not coming out until the end of November, November 30th.

183
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:57,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Not many places have actually, no one's really said anything about this delay, but I have the inside info, being that I work for a video distributor.

184
00:13:58,966 --> 00:14:01,307
[SPEAKER_04]: So, that's straight from Sony, folks.

185
00:14:02,948 --> 00:14:04,889
[SPEAKER_04]: Gotta hate it.

186
00:14:05,049 --> 00:14:11,271
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope I'm wrong, and I hope that data is just pulled out of thin air and Sony doesn't know what they're talking about, but

187
00:14:12,162 --> 00:14:12,823
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm afraid it's true.

188
00:14:32,819 --> 00:14:50,358
[SPEAKER_05]: and some in Europe so probably not a whole lot of Japanese listeners we've got but if you are listening to us and you're interested in going you need to be registered with the Shinra Company online fan club and I'm guessing if you're not already signed up you might have lost out because I don't think they're accepting new club members anymore so um

189
00:14:51,119 --> 00:14:54,362
[SPEAKER_05]: They will randomly select people if they get too many people that want to get in.

190
00:14:55,222 --> 00:15:00,547
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be happening September 10th through the 16th in Tokyo.

191
00:15:01,648 --> 00:15:08,373
[SPEAKER_05]: Nagoya and Kyoto will be the three cities that will be showing Final Fantasy Advent Children on the big screen.

192
00:15:09,254 --> 00:15:11,976
[SPEAKER_05]: Otherwise, you're going to have to wait for the UMD and DVD formats.

193
00:15:13,444 --> 00:15:14,524
[SPEAKER_05]: Here in America as well.

194
00:15:15,645 --> 00:15:20,986
[SPEAKER_05]: One other story, I know the big news this week, the game we're all excited about is Nintendogs is coming out this week.

195
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:22,187
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm very excited about this.

196
00:15:23,727 --> 00:15:28,348
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the interesting thing about Nintendogs, they're actually going to be getting a special holiday edition.

197
00:15:28,448 --> 00:15:36,871
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, okay, it's kind of a rumor right now, but Nintendo of America did file some papers with the ESRB that indicate something called

198
00:15:37,331 --> 00:15:39,853
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendogs Holiday Edition.

199
00:15:40,394 --> 00:15:46,899
[SPEAKER_05]: And we all know how Nintendo loves to get you to buy the same crap in new packaging over and over again.

200
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:50,682
[SPEAKER_05]: So this really wouldn't be a surprise if this is something they are actually doing.

201
00:15:51,042 --> 00:15:52,483
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendogs Holiday Edition.

202
00:15:52,803 --> 00:15:53,384
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think?

203
00:15:55,806 --> 00:15:58,988
[SPEAKER_05]: Are they being premature with this though since the game hasn't even come out here?

204
00:15:59,048 --> 00:16:00,609
[SPEAKER_05]: It could be a massive failure here.

205
00:16:00,729 --> 00:16:01,390
[SPEAKER_05]: I doubt it will be.

206
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:02,270
[SPEAKER_05]: But it could be.

207
00:16:02,451 --> 00:16:04,532
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's not going to be a failure.

208
00:16:04,933 --> 00:16:06,794
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's coming out right after my wedding, you know.

209
00:16:08,319 --> 00:16:08,839
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that a hint?

210
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,640
[SPEAKER_05]: You're already going to get it.

211
00:16:11,161 --> 00:16:12,422
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't have to buy it for your wedding.

212
00:16:12,462 --> 00:16:13,302
[SPEAKER_05]: You're already going to have it.

213
00:16:13,602 --> 00:16:14,003
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.

214
00:16:14,403 --> 00:16:23,068
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I think, honestly, I see the game being a big success because if there's one thing Nintendo understands, it's a formula.

215
00:16:24,509 --> 00:16:26,971
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we have Pokemon as our big example.

216
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:32,754
[SPEAKER_01]: They know what's going to appeal, and there's already been so much hype from the Japanese version.

217
00:16:32,895 --> 00:16:34,956
[SPEAKER_01]: It's already so widely popular.

218
00:16:36,616 --> 00:16:37,797
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see any way for

219
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:54,446
[SPEAKER_05]: The Game Boy Micro is going to be coming out here for $99.99.

220
00:16:55,267 --> 00:17:03,495
[SPEAKER_05]: Now the Game Boy Micro, for those of you that were sleeping during E3 coverage, it's like the Game Boy Advance, but really freaking tiny.

221
00:17:03,795 --> 00:17:04,996
[SPEAKER_05]: Like palm of your hand tiny.

222
00:17:05,056 --> 00:17:07,578
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little bit bigger than the Game Boy Advance cartridges.

223
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:12,363
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go look on our E3 pictures, they have a pretty close up image.

224
00:17:13,331 --> 00:17:13,651
[SPEAKER_05]: They do.

225
00:17:14,411 --> 00:17:15,972
[SPEAKER_05]: We do have that in the gallery.

226
00:17:16,132 --> 00:17:18,012
[SPEAKER_05]: Four inches wide, this thing is.

227
00:17:18,292 --> 00:17:20,393
[SPEAKER_05]: It's tiny.

228
00:17:20,413 --> 00:17:20,393
$99.99.

229
00:17:20,453 --> 00:17:24,514
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be coming out September 19th is the day this is coming out.

230
00:17:24,894 --> 00:17:26,055
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, faceplates.

231
00:17:26,235 --> 00:17:28,515
[SPEAKER_05]: The faceplate changing is a big thing they're doing with this.

232
00:17:28,555 --> 00:17:32,016
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can have a Game Boy Micro that matches your purse or something.

233
00:17:32,036 --> 00:17:32,337
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

234
00:17:32,757 --> 00:17:36,158
[SPEAKER_05]: Flame, camouflage, or just simple silver.

235
00:17:36,978 --> 00:17:37,098
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

236
00:17:37,645 --> 00:17:38,946
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, yeah, they come with...

237
00:17:54,133 --> 00:17:57,655
[SPEAKER_04]: The Silver or Black Faceplate, depending on whether yours is silver or black.

238
00:17:57,795 --> 00:17:58,976
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

239
00:17:59,497 --> 00:18:03,439
[SPEAKER_05]: Japanese release will be September 13th, and it'll be coming out for 12,000 yen.

240
00:18:03,719 --> 00:18:06,721
[SPEAKER_05]: That's about $109, so it's a little more expensive in Japan.

241
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:17,968
[SPEAKER_05]: But get this, for our European friends, we're paying $99, they're paying 99 euro, and the euro's worth a little more, so that's $121 US.

242
00:18:18,068 --> 00:18:18,609
[SPEAKER_05]: November 4th.

243
00:18:18,629 --> 00:18:19,830
[SPEAKER_05]: But they get pink.

244
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:20,390
[SPEAKER_05]: It's too bad.

245
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:21,471
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, but they get pink.

246
00:18:22,551 --> 00:18:23,372
[SPEAKER_05]: Not that, you know...

247
00:18:24,301 --> 00:18:24,701
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I know.

248
00:18:25,742 --> 00:18:26,062
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

249
00:18:26,442 --> 00:18:30,765
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to take a minute to open up the old mailbag here at Orange Lounge Radio.

250
00:18:30,785 --> 00:18:35,487
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember, you guys can send in your questions for Orange Lounge Radio at our address.

251
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:40,690
[SPEAKER_05]: It's togo, T-O-G-O, at orangeloungeradio.com.

252
00:18:41,731 --> 00:18:43,011
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have a couple of letters this week.

253
00:18:43,051 --> 00:18:47,494
[SPEAKER_05]: The first letter I'd like to read comes from SithSpawn is the name of the

254
00:18:47,981 --> 00:18:49,422
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have any kids and I don't ever want them.

255
00:18:49,442 --> 00:18:51,283
[SPEAKER_05]: However, I do have a few words concerning video game violence and ratings.

256
00:18:51,303 --> 00:18:55,706
[SPEAKER_05]: The main problem originates with the many groups pushing for stricter ratings and or the banning of certain games.

257
00:19:11,397 --> 00:19:11,857
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching!

258
00:19:32,425 --> 00:19:36,367
[SPEAKER_05]: Brian from Michigan is suggesting there are two simple steps to deal with this problem.

259
00:19:36,728 --> 00:19:37,528
[SPEAKER_05]: Know your games.

260
00:19:38,048 --> 00:19:41,350
[SPEAKER_05]: As a parent, you need to know about the ratings and actually play these games.

261
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:44,412
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, take the ratings with a grain of salt.

262
00:19:44,732 --> 00:19:48,474
[SPEAKER_05]: The opinions of the ESRB aren't necessarily your own.

263
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:49,915
[SPEAKER_05]: Instruct your child.

264
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:56,799
[SPEAKER_05]: The only way to prevent your kid from playing the games you do not want them to play is to ensure that they do not want to play them.

265
00:19:57,179 --> 00:19:59,380
[SPEAKER_05]: It's exactly the same as saying no to drugs.

266
00:19:59,741 --> 00:20:04,686
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all about the child making decisions based on input from the parents.

267
00:20:05,027 --> 00:20:09,271
[SPEAKER_05]: Give your kid the tools he or she needs to make educated decisions when you are not around.

268
00:20:09,972 --> 00:20:10,753
[SPEAKER_05]: Very interesting.

269
00:20:10,813 --> 00:20:13,396
[SPEAKER_05]: I like his steps there that he offers there.

270
00:20:13,436 --> 00:20:16,739
[SPEAKER_05]: A very educated response from our friend SithSpawn.

271
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,082
[SPEAKER_01]: I was very impressed with that letter.

272
00:20:19,302 --> 00:20:19,943
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it was very nice.

273
00:20:21,174 --> 00:20:22,275
[SPEAKER_05]: We also have another letter here.

274
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:25,118
[SPEAKER_05]: This letter is from another Jamie.

275
00:20:25,218 --> 00:20:27,680
[SPEAKER_05]: It actually could be Jaime, but we think it's Jamie.

276
00:20:28,801 --> 00:20:32,323
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie's been listening to the show for two months now and says it's really interesting.

277
00:20:32,764 --> 00:20:33,024
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

278
00:20:33,284 --> 00:20:36,507
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a reason you guys won the podcast award, partially because of my vote.

279
00:20:36,547 --> 00:20:37,087
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you again.

280
00:20:37,548 --> 00:20:37,868
[SPEAKER_05]: Very kind.

281
00:20:38,428 --> 00:20:42,672
[SPEAKER_05]: I know exactly what you mean about the misspelling of your name in talking to our own Jamie here.

282
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:45,354
[SPEAKER_05]: I have the exact same problem, but in reverse.

283
00:20:45,434 --> 00:20:47,596
[SPEAKER_05]: This person spells their name J-A-I-M-E.

284
00:20:48,991 --> 00:20:49,792
[SPEAKER_05]: So very interesting.

285
00:20:50,854 --> 00:20:54,239
[SPEAKER_05]: We were talking about Evercrack's economy.

286
00:20:54,339 --> 00:21:02,112
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Jamie actually sent us a link to an article about the economy, and it's a really good link to a story that has more information on the economy.

287
00:21:02,877 --> 00:21:19,642
[SPEAKER_05]: http://mu.ranter.net theory economy.html And actually what this is, this is kind of like an opinion piece about the economy inside video games.

288
00:21:19,722 --> 00:21:21,022
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a really well-written piece.

289
00:21:21,282 --> 00:21:22,662
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you guys have some time, check that out.

290
00:21:22,702 --> 00:21:23,383
[SPEAKER_05]: That's very cool.

291
00:21:24,343 --> 00:21:31,465
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, Jamie wanted to point out a website called stopstopkill.com Jamie, did you have a chance to check out stopstopkill.com?

292
00:21:33,314 --> 00:21:34,714
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, this is one I knew about.

293
00:21:34,754 --> 00:21:40,876
[SPEAKER_01]: At the time, it was more of a placeholder, but it actually looks like it's gone full active.

294
00:21:40,996 --> 00:21:43,877
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about the truth about violence in video games.

295
00:21:44,557 --> 00:21:47,558
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone else, you know, trying to get the word out there.

296
00:21:48,198 --> 00:21:57,140
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, any type of research that's being done in regards to video games, they're putting this up on their site.

297
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:59,621
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, also putting out...

298
00:22:00,285 --> 00:22:06,451
[SPEAKER_01]: Trying to give the whole broad spectrum, but also trying to say, hey, this is where you are wrong.

299
00:22:08,933 --> 00:22:10,895
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a pretty awesome site so far.

300
00:22:10,955 --> 00:22:12,116
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty impressed with it.

301
00:22:12,236 --> 00:22:16,560
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, there's a forum on here that says Gamers Against Jack Forum.

302
00:22:16,581 --> 00:22:17,742
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

303
00:22:17,782 --> 00:22:18,883
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about Jack Thompson.

304
00:22:19,683 --> 00:22:23,587
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, it links back to Jack Thompson's site, StopKill.com.

305
00:22:25,008 --> 00:22:25,469
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.

306
00:22:26,059 --> 00:22:30,361
[SPEAKER_01]: which is basically more of Jack Thompson talking out of his ass.

307
00:22:32,342 --> 00:22:33,002
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's true.

308
00:22:33,042 --> 00:22:38,304
[SPEAKER_01]: The man, I hate to say, well, I don't really hate to say it, but he's a freaking idiot.

309
00:22:39,364 --> 00:22:41,485
[SPEAKER_01]: Jack Thompson, if you're listening, you're a moron.

310
00:22:42,325 --> 00:22:42,886
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for that.

311
00:22:42,906 --> 00:22:43,626
[SPEAKER_05]: He'll appreciate that.

312
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:49,650
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

313
00:22:49,911 --> 00:22:50,291
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway.

314
00:22:50,511 --> 00:22:51,332
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, moving on.

315
00:22:52,332 --> 00:22:53,193
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, moving forward.

316
00:22:53,433 --> 00:22:56,735
[SPEAKER_01]: But this site is pretty cool, and we need more stuff like this.

317
00:22:56,835 --> 00:23:15,949
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually going to, as soon as I get an opportunity to send this guy a link to that article I found on Game Revolution with the information provided from the FBI and Department of Justice showing the crime rate in youth going down since the release of the PS1.

318
00:23:15,989 --> 00:23:17,270
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that he might benefit from that.

319
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:17,890
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

320
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,621
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, it's funny that we got an email from somebody named Jamie because we also got an email from somebody named Rob.

321
00:23:25,101 --> 00:23:30,402
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm actually going to start with Rob's PS because he said kind of a nice thing here and I just want to repeat it.

322
00:23:31,302 --> 00:23:35,943
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob said something about sorry for delaying a podcast and listeners inquiring what went on.

323
00:23:36,303 --> 00:23:38,624
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate your contribution to the video game media.

324
00:23:38,704 --> 00:23:41,544
[SPEAKER_05]: Since it's free, I don't think I have any right to demand it.

325
00:23:41,604 --> 00:23:42,825
[SPEAKER_05]: People should be more gracious.

326
00:23:42,965 --> 00:23:44,465
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's really nice, Rob.

327
00:23:44,505 --> 00:23:45,185
[SPEAKER_05]: We try our best.

328
00:23:45,592 --> 00:23:45,872
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

329
00:24:06,451 --> 00:24:07,211
[SPEAKER_05]: We do, it's awesome.

330
00:24:08,472 --> 00:24:15,796
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, he actually had a response to an article about virtual ethics, which I thought was very interesting.

331
00:24:16,797 --> 00:24:23,420
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, did you have any reports on ethics going on, like the mugging that's going on in games or anything?

332
00:24:24,241 --> 00:24:35,907
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, just to give sort of a bit of a paraphrasing from this one article that he linked me to, a man was arrested in Japan on suspicion of carrying out a virtual mugging spree by using software bots to beat up

333
00:24:36,277 --> 00:24:38,438
[SPEAKER_01]: and robbed characters in the online game Lineage 2.

334
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:39,858
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to try that at E3 a couple years ago.

335
00:24:40,058 --> 00:24:41,439
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what you do in that game.

336
00:24:41,459 --> 00:24:45,140
[SPEAKER_01]: The stolen possessions, the virtual items, were exchanged for cash.

337
00:24:46,721 --> 00:24:50,942
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a Chinese exchange student that was arrested for this in Kagawa.

338
00:24:51,162 --> 00:24:52,242
[SPEAKER_01]: Hmm.

339
00:24:53,403 --> 00:24:57,424
[SPEAKER_01]: Several players had their characters beaten and robbed of valuable virtual objects.

340
00:24:58,865 --> 00:25:02,206
[SPEAKER_01]: It names items called Earring of Wisdom and Shield of Nightmare.

341
00:25:02,226 --> 00:25:04,807
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess they're pretty big things in Lineage.

342
00:25:05,147 --> 00:25:05,267
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

343
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:10,604
[SPEAKER_01]: But the items were fenced off through a Japanese auction website, according to NCSoft.

344
00:25:10,844 --> 00:25:12,065
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the company that makes Lineage 2.

345
00:25:13,006 --> 00:25:15,028
[SPEAKER_01]: And he did it by using a software bot.

346
00:25:15,709 --> 00:25:16,470
[SPEAKER_01]: So it couldn't be beat.

347
00:25:17,665 --> 00:25:18,185
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

348
00:25:18,285 --> 00:25:19,486
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's always a way around this.

349
00:25:19,506 --> 00:25:21,087
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I want to read Rob's response to this.

350
00:25:22,087 --> 00:25:27,049
[SPEAKER_05]: If you feel your character and stuff are worth paying blackmail, you seriously need a real life.

351
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:27,830
[SPEAKER_05]: Who knows?

352
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:35,754
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe the virtual mugging sent the victim home from the internet cafe early to inadvertently save the lives of himself and or his neglected offspring.

353
00:25:36,074 --> 00:25:38,235
[SPEAKER_05]: Blackmail in real life is a serious crime.

354
00:25:38,295 --> 00:25:40,656
[SPEAKER_05]: Virtual ethics had nothing to do with the perp's arrest.

355
00:25:41,089 --> 00:25:42,229
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

356
00:26:10,829 --> 00:26:14,372
[SPEAKER_01]: In regards to the virtual ethics thing, sad.

357
00:26:16,173 --> 00:26:17,714
[SPEAKER_02]: Sad.

358
00:26:17,814 --> 00:26:19,075
[SPEAKER_01]: I weep for society.

359
00:26:19,696 --> 00:26:23,718
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I did have another email that was linked to me.

360
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:26,681
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just go ahead.

361
00:26:26,701 --> 00:26:28,782
[SPEAKER_01]: It was an article that was within it.

362
00:26:28,842 --> 00:26:32,605
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, I couldn't find the original one, but it's a little brief one.

363
00:26:33,526 --> 00:26:36,768
[SPEAKER_01]: Going back to the game addiction business.

364
00:26:37,871 --> 00:26:37,991
[SPEAKER_01]: Hmm.

365
00:26:38,231 --> 00:26:38,291
[SPEAKER_01]: Hmm.

366
00:27:03,137 --> 00:27:08,233
[SPEAKER_01]: He was moved to a hospital but died a few hours later due to what the doctors are presuming was a heart attack.

367
00:27:08,965 --> 00:27:10,766
[SPEAKER_05]: I swear I've heard this story before.

368
00:27:11,107 --> 00:27:19,933
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, maybe not this exact same person, but I swear I've heard this exact same setup, internet cafe, person there playing their game too damn much, and dying from it.

369
00:27:19,993 --> 00:27:21,133
[SPEAKER_05]: I swear I've heard this before.

370
00:27:21,153 --> 00:27:22,174
[SPEAKER_05]: That happened a couple weeks ago.

371
00:27:22,234 --> 00:27:24,636
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody didn't get the hint the last time, apparently.

372
00:27:25,296 --> 00:27:30,320
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, actually, when I got the link on this, it was earlier within the week, and the time says five hours ago.

373
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:31,080
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

374
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:32,241
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was fairly recent.

375
00:27:32,261 --> 00:27:36,524
[SPEAKER_01]: They also said that he'd been fired from his job because he kept missing work to play computer games.

376
00:27:37,142 --> 00:27:37,522
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

377
00:27:37,802 --> 00:27:39,923
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's like instead of drinking, he gamed.

378
00:27:41,204 --> 00:27:54,629
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and you know, if you look at it this way, for the people who are those, you know, hardcore addicts to booze, they're trying to escape from something that's gone wrong in their life.

379
00:27:55,989 --> 00:28:01,551
[SPEAKER_01]: These people are using, you know, games in return to escape from the, you know, the bad that's gone on in their life.

380
00:28:01,852 --> 00:28:02,852
[SPEAKER_01]: Which sort of goes back to...

381
00:28:03,815 --> 00:28:07,538
[SPEAKER_05]: How would an internet cafe allow you to be there for 48 hours straight?

382
00:28:07,578 --> 00:28:11,982
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I know there's 24-hour cafes and everything, but isn't that unethical business?

383
00:28:12,542 --> 00:28:18,106
[SPEAKER_05]: I realize we're talking about another country, but... Well, I know they're making money, but at some point, don't you have to draw the line?

384
00:28:18,347 --> 00:28:19,828
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got to sleep at some point.

385
00:28:19,888 --> 00:28:20,208
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on.

386
00:28:20,688 --> 00:28:28,354
[SPEAKER_05]: When you go to a bar and the bartender sees that you've had one too many drinks, the bartender has a... I don't know if it's legal.

387
00:28:28,374 --> 00:28:29,195
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm almost positive it is.

388
00:28:29,495 --> 00:28:30,116
[SPEAKER_05]: But they have an...

389
00:28:30,456 --> 00:28:33,118
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care where in the world you are, why didn't somebody stop this guy?

390
00:28:54,793 --> 00:28:57,036
[SPEAKER_01]: This man was ultimately responsible for himself.

391
00:28:57,437 --> 00:29:04,626
[SPEAKER_01]: By all rights, it's not their place to tell him how to live his life, basically.

392
00:29:05,267 --> 00:29:06,508
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a paying customer.

393
00:29:06,568 --> 00:29:09,132
[SPEAKER_01]: If he chooses to pay with his life for that...

394
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:14,193
[SPEAKER_01]: It really isn't their... I mean, this may sound cold, but it really isn't their concern.

395
00:29:14,433 --> 00:29:15,214
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand that point.

396
00:29:15,794 --> 00:29:27,562
[SPEAKER_05]: It is ultimately his fault, but why didn't anybody, his friend, a loved one who noticed he was missing for 48 hours, a worker at the place who must have seen this going on, nobody intervened?

397
00:29:28,083 --> 00:29:30,244
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's, like, not good Samaritan.

398
00:29:30,524 --> 00:29:31,845
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

399
00:29:32,025 --> 00:29:34,967
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody should let anybody play StarCraft for that long anyway.

400
00:29:34,987 --> 00:29:37,189
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw that coming.

401
00:29:37,209 --> 00:29:38,249
[SPEAKER_05]: That's exactly what my point is.

402
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:38,750
[SPEAKER_05]: I do.

403
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:38,970
[SPEAKER_05]: Eventually,

404
00:29:41,192 --> 00:29:41,712
DarkSakura.com

405
00:30:10,899 --> 00:30:12,460
[SPEAKER_05]: You seriously gotta question your priorities.

406
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:13,361
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously.

407
00:30:13,701 --> 00:30:27,851
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, once in a great while, it might be okay because, you know, you're not feeling up to it or whatever, but if you notice yourself, you're doing it repeatedly over and over again, you're not going out and having a real life because you're staying in and playing video games of any nature, really, not just MMOs.

408
00:30:29,032 --> 00:30:30,333
[SPEAKER_05]: You gotta get outdoors once in a while.

409
00:30:30,393 --> 00:30:35,377
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why we do our advice column, which I guess is a good segue into that portion of the show, right?

410
00:30:36,458 --> 00:30:38,820
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, Rob, you know I did that once when I was in high school.

411
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:39,340
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

412
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:39,440
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

413
00:30:40,131 --> 00:30:44,492
[SPEAKER_01]: I stayed out of school for a week to play Final Fantasy 3, which was 6.

414
00:30:45,052 --> 00:30:47,213
[SPEAKER_05]: But you didn't do that all the time, right?

415
00:30:47,973 --> 00:30:51,294
[SPEAKER_01]: No, and I actually did legitimately develop the flu within that week.

416
00:30:51,614 --> 00:30:52,054
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.

417
00:30:52,094 --> 00:30:55,455
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, see, it's still a little extreme.

418
00:30:55,575 --> 00:30:58,215
[SPEAKER_05]: I still might kind of raise my eyebrow at that and go, Jamie.

419
00:30:58,515 --> 00:31:01,656
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is to the point that I was in high school.

420
00:31:02,116 --> 00:31:03,397
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm an adult now.

421
00:31:03,677 --> 00:31:04,877
[SPEAKER_01]: That man was an adult.

422
00:31:05,191 --> 00:31:06,252
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no excuse.

423
00:31:06,272 --> 00:31:06,752
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, hell no.

424
00:31:06,772 --> 00:31:09,975
[SPEAKER_05]: I just bounce uncontrollably at work until I get to go home and play it.

425
00:31:09,995 --> 00:31:10,435
[SPEAKER_05]: No time to live!

426
00:31:31,553 --> 00:31:34,115
[SPEAKER_05]: So DarkSakura is here to give us her advice column.

427
00:31:34,155 --> 00:31:36,976
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, what is your advice about tonight?

428
00:31:39,058 --> 00:31:44,281
[SPEAKER_01]: Today's bit of advice is how to survive if you are in the line of fire, if you are the primary target.

429
00:31:45,682 --> 00:31:49,644
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that means like everyone else is wearing camo, you're wearing white.

430
00:31:50,765 --> 00:31:54,867
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one, get as far away as possible, a.k.a.

431
00:31:54,927 --> 00:31:55,527
[SPEAKER_01]: run like hell.

432
00:31:56,228 --> 00:32:00,951
[SPEAKER_01]: An untrained shooter is not likely to be accurate at any distance greater than 60 feet.

433
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:06,361
[SPEAKER_01]: 2.

434
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,361
[SPEAKER_01]: Run fast, but do not move in a straight line.

435
00:32:06,501 --> 00:32:07,522
[SPEAKER_01]: Weave back and forth.

436
00:32:08,042 --> 00:32:13,885
[SPEAKER_01]: The average shooter will not have the training necessary to hit a moving target at any real distance.

437
00:32:13,905 --> 00:32:13,885
3.

438
00:32:14,325 --> 00:32:15,825
[SPEAKER_01]: Turn a corner if possible.

439
00:32:15,885 --> 00:32:16,686
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, duh.

440
00:32:17,986 --> 00:32:16,686
4.

441
00:32:18,487 --> 00:32:20,227
[SPEAKER_01]: Do not bother to count shots.

442
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:23,789
[SPEAKER_01]: You will have no idea the shooter has more ammunition.

443
00:32:24,169 --> 00:32:26,190
[SPEAKER_01]: Counting is only for the movies.

444
00:32:27,498 --> 00:32:29,338
[SPEAKER_01]: My final bit of advice.

445
00:32:29,518 --> 00:32:29,778
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

446
00:32:30,839 --> 00:32:31,299
[SPEAKER_01]: Shoot back.

447
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:33,719
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

448
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:35,980
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically this.

449
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,200
[SPEAKER_01]: Run like a bitch.

450
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:40,941
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's my favorite final piece of advice you've ever given on this program.

451
00:32:41,581 --> 00:32:41,781
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

452
00:32:41,801 --> 00:32:42,361
[SPEAKER_05]: That was nice.

453
00:32:42,401 --> 00:32:42,721
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

454
00:32:43,401 --> 00:32:46,162
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're getting shot at, freaking shoot back.

455
00:32:48,122 --> 00:32:48,362
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

456
00:32:48,462 --> 00:32:48,822
[SPEAKER_05]: Real nice.

457
00:32:49,322 --> 00:32:50,623
[SPEAKER_01]: Taunt them as you run.

458
00:32:51,243 --> 00:32:52,043
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, what else you got?

459
00:32:52,063 --> 00:32:52,303
[SPEAKER_05]: Perhaps they

460
00:32:55,819 --> 00:32:57,900
[SPEAKER_05]: Now go away before I taunt you a second time.

461
00:32:59,121 --> 00:33:01,922
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, what's going on in the hack and crack scene?

462
00:33:02,383 --> 00:33:03,423
[SPEAKER_04]: There's tons of stuff.

463
00:33:04,224 --> 00:33:11,367
[SPEAKER_04]: First off, there was a nice cell shading demo that was released, kind of showing what homebrew stuff can do right now, which is kind of neat.

464
00:33:12,608 --> 00:33:21,393
[SPEAKER_04]: And then also on top of that, looks like SanDisk was announcing that they're going to be releasing their 2GB memory stick here pretty soon.

465
00:33:22,574 --> 00:33:22,714
[SPEAKER_04]: TI-MIDI

466
00:33:51,348 --> 00:33:52,688
[SPEAKER_04]: or Miditty, I guess.

467
00:33:53,668 --> 00:33:59,469
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a MIDI playing program that's on the PSP, which was kind of interesting.

468
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:09,231
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a rhythm composer program being made, PSP Rhythm Composer, and that's kind of like a drum machine type thing, which is interesting.

469
00:34:10,751 --> 00:34:17,492
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, there was a program that was released called PSP Tune, which helps you tune your guitar.

470
00:34:18,333 --> 00:34:18,593
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh.

471
00:34:19,073 --> 00:34:20,093
[SPEAKER_04]: That's helpful.

472
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:34,834
[SPEAKER_04]: On the DS end of things, there was also an update done to the ColecoVision emulator, which is called ColecoDS, appropriately.

473
00:34:35,715 --> 00:34:44,638
[SPEAKER_04]: And version 0.2 is released, and they've got some interesting screenshots on ndsupdates.com, so go check those out if you have some time.

474
00:34:45,325 --> 00:34:46,246
[SPEAKER_04]: OrangeLoungeRadio.com

475
00:35:04,113 --> 00:35:05,014
[SPEAKER_05]: Dance Dance Revolution Xtreme 2

476
00:35:25,075 --> 00:35:36,540
[SPEAKER_05]: including La Copa De Vida from Patrick Victorio, that's a cover of the original Ricky Martin one, Look At Us, the Daddy DJ remix by Serena Paris, and Cartoon Heroes from Barbie Young.

477
00:35:36,861 --> 00:35:48,326
[SPEAKER_05]: Even some old songs, Boom Boom Dollar, K.O.G.G.3 mix from King Kong and D-Jungle Girls, Captain Jack, a Grondale remix from Captain Jack, and Butterfly, the Upswing mix from SmileDK.

478
00:35:49,013 --> 00:35:49,674
[SPEAKER_05]: Spin, Spin, Sugar

479
00:35:58,919 --> 00:36:02,601
[SPEAKER_05]: by the Sneaker Pimps, Silence by Delirium with Sarah McLachlan.

480
00:36:03,541 --> 00:36:09,444
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, we have Block Rockin' Beats by the Chemical Brothers and As the Rush Comes from Motorcycle.

481
00:36:09,744 --> 00:36:10,844
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's just a short list.

482
00:36:11,705 --> 00:36:13,285
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, also Get Busy by Sean Paul.

483
00:36:13,305 --> 00:36:14,186
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of a neat little song.

484
00:36:15,046 --> 00:36:19,028
[SPEAKER_05]: The full list, of course, is available on our website, www.orangeloungeradio.com.

485
00:36:19,748 --> 00:36:23,611
[SPEAKER_05]: Also making an announcement this week, Karaoke Revolution Party.

486
00:36:24,151 --> 00:36:27,013
[SPEAKER_05]: Whole lot of songs in Karaoke Revolution Party Edition.

487
00:36:28,154 --> 00:36:37,101
[SPEAKER_05]: My gosh, Take On Me, Material Girl, Me and Bobby McGee, Flame, Do You Really Want to Hurt Me, Call Me, American Woman.

488
00:36:37,241 --> 00:36:38,782
[SPEAKER_05]: I could read this list all day.

489
00:36:38,902 --> 00:36:39,403
[SPEAKER_05]: It's huge.

490
00:36:39,683 --> 00:36:41,204
[SPEAKER_05]: Check it out, orangelaunchradio.com.

491
00:36:41,224 --> 00:36:45,207
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to be Karaoke Revolution Party Edition coming out a little later this year.

492
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:51,586
[SPEAKER_05]: Konami's also announcing Suikoden Tactics, which is going to be coming out for the PlayStation 2.

493
00:36:52,587 --> 00:36:57,989
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, you could think of this as kind of like Final Fantasy Tactics, but Suikoden Tactics!

494
00:36:58,849 --> 00:37:02,231
[SPEAKER_05]: The official announcement came out this week that it will be coming out for the PlayStation 2.

495
00:37:03,191 --> 00:37:06,533
[SPEAKER_05]: We're looking at a spring 2006 release date for this game.

496
00:37:08,618 --> 00:37:09,079
[SPEAKER_05]: Advent Rising

497
00:37:21,542 --> 00:37:33,453
[SPEAKER_05]: Due to too many bugs going on with the game, or basically I was going to say too many bugs, too many things going wrong in the system, they have quietly canceled the million dollar giveaway.

498
00:37:33,493 --> 00:37:34,674
[SPEAKER_05]: That happened earlier this week.

499
00:37:35,075 --> 00:37:45,204
[SPEAKER_05]: Instead, as kind of a consolation prize, each person who participated in the Race to Save Humanity contest will receive two free games from its recent catalog.

500
00:37:45,284 --> 00:37:46,205
[SPEAKER_05]: Not too bad.

501
00:37:46,778 --> 00:37:56,462
[SPEAKER_05]: of a consolation prize when you consider that the games you can choose from, BloodRayne 2, Guilty Gear X2 Reload, Psychonauts, Rays as Hell, and Phantom Dust.

502
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:58,863
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's quite a few good games in that catalog there.

503
00:37:59,463 --> 00:38:06,286
[SPEAKER_05]: Too bad though about that million dollar competition because they stand to be paying that much out in all these free games.

504
00:38:06,366 --> 00:38:06,706
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

505
00:38:06,766 --> 00:38:08,287
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how many people were in this contest.

506
00:38:08,367 --> 00:38:13,989
[SPEAKER_05]: This really wasn't a game that appealed to me personally, but I just think it's interesting that the contest had to be called off.

507
00:38:14,029 --> 00:38:16,450
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a cool game, but it did have its fair share of bugs.

508
00:38:16,724 --> 00:38:17,485
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's too bad.

509
00:38:18,526 --> 00:38:18,806
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

510
00:38:20,328 --> 00:38:30,460
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, I want to point this out, World of Warcraft, you know this, the MMO, the most popular MMO which none of us play here on this program.

511
00:38:32,548 --> 00:38:35,351
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually have a friend that's really trying to get me into it, too.

512
00:38:35,411 --> 00:38:40,355
[SPEAKER_05]: I've tried to install it, and my computer won't accept the installation for some reason, which makes no sense to me.

513
00:38:40,375 --> 00:38:41,515
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, no!

514
00:38:41,575 --> 00:38:42,556
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I don't want this.

515
00:38:42,596 --> 00:38:44,818
[SPEAKER_05]: You already put enough crappy MMOs on me.

516
00:38:45,679 --> 00:38:47,180
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm trying to make it work.

517
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:51,623
[SPEAKER_05]: So we will soon be reporting from inside World of Warcraft at some point, hopefully.

518
00:38:52,324 --> 00:38:56,047
[SPEAKER_05]: But we did want to point out Upper Deck Entertainment.

519
00:38:56,487 --> 00:38:57,808
[SPEAKER_05]: What is Upper Deck well known for?

520
00:38:58,629 --> 00:38:59,069
[SPEAKER_05]: Cards.

521
00:38:59,089 --> 00:39:00,090
[SPEAKER_05]: Cards, that's right.

522
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:01,011
[SPEAKER_05]: They are making a...

523
00:39:01,769 --> 00:39:06,073
[SPEAKER_05]: They are making a trading card game based out of World of Warcraft.

524
00:39:06,694 --> 00:39:19,466
[SPEAKER_05]: The quote from Jerry Benton, Senior Vice President of Upper Deck Entertainment, The World of Warcraft trading card game will perfectly capture all of the action-packed combat and furious competition that online players have come to expect.

525
00:39:19,646 --> 00:39:21,928
[SPEAKER_05]: Will there be a slash... Oh wait, no, that's EverQuest 2.

526
00:39:21,968 --> 00:39:22,869
[SPEAKER_04]: Slash pizza card, that'd be sweet.

527
00:39:26,826 --> 00:39:26,926
[SPEAKER_04]: XBOX 360

528
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,942
[SPEAKER_05]: Very interesting.

529
00:39:51,703 --> 00:39:53,464
[SPEAKER_05]: $299.99 US for the basic unit.

530
00:39:53,545 --> 00:39:57,108
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why they just don't say $300, because that's what you're going to be paying after tax.

531
00:39:57,328 --> 00:39:57,108
$300.

532
00:39:58,168 --> 00:40:06,936
[SPEAKER_05]: So for $300, you're going to get the Xbox 360 console, the controller, which is a wired controller, but it has an extended 9-foot cable.

533
00:40:07,476 --> 00:40:10,437
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't understand anyways because there's no freaking controller ports on there.

534
00:40:10,477 --> 00:40:11,917
[SPEAKER_04]: So where are you playing it?

535
00:40:12,478 --> 00:40:13,198
[SPEAKER_04]: Now a new game.

536
00:40:13,298 --> 00:40:14,238
[SPEAKER_04]: Find the controller port.

537
00:40:14,378 --> 00:40:15,458
[SPEAKER_05]: A USB port maybe?

538
00:40:16,119 --> 00:40:16,619
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever.

539
00:40:16,739 --> 00:40:17,039
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe?

540
00:40:17,299 --> 00:40:17,719
[SPEAKER_05]: Gotcha.

541
00:40:17,939 --> 00:40:18,239
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

542
00:40:18,659 --> 00:40:24,561
[SPEAKER_05]: An Xbox 360 faceplate and an Xbox 360 standard AV cable.

543
00:40:25,021 --> 00:40:25,281
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

544
00:40:25,341 --> 00:40:25,941
[SPEAKER_05]: Composite.

545
00:40:26,502 --> 00:40:27,582
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's the first one.

546
00:40:28,908 --> 00:40:29,248
[SPEAKER_05]: XBOX 360 CORE

547
00:40:44,607 --> 00:40:49,150
[SPEAKER_05]: 400 bucks, console, hard drive, 20 gigabytes.

548
00:40:49,511 --> 00:40:55,615
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, ladies and gentlemen, the Xbox 360 will not have a hard drive built in by default like the original Xbox did.

549
00:40:55,695 --> 00:40:56,275
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I'm doing?

550
00:40:56,295 --> 00:40:56,435
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

551
00:40:56,455 --> 00:41:00,058
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to take that freaking hard drive and rip it apart and put a 120 gig hard drive in there.

552
00:41:00,158 --> 00:41:01,899
[SPEAKER_04]: Screw that 20 gig crap.

553
00:41:01,919 --> 00:41:12,226
[SPEAKER_05]: For the $400, you get the wireless controller, the faceplate, a headset, a component high-definition cable, so you... Well, let me... I'll get to that thought.

554
00:41:12,606 --> 00:41:13,467
[SPEAKER_05]: Xbox Live...

555
00:41:16,023 --> 00:41:20,086
[SPEAKER_05]: Xbox Live Silver Membership Bonus Media Remote

556
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:49,013
[SPEAKER_05]: is kind of trying to soften the blow of the fact that the system really costs $400 for everything you want.

557
00:41:49,053 --> 00:41:53,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm thinking what people are going to do is be buying that when the third-party stuff starts coming out.

558
00:41:53,756 --> 00:41:54,596
[SPEAKER_04]: Possibly.

559
00:41:54,656 --> 00:41:56,638
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you don't have to buy a hard drive.

560
00:41:56,658 --> 00:42:03,261
[SPEAKER_04]: You can buy this stupid little 64-meg memory card thing, and you don't have to buy a wireless controller.

561
00:42:03,281 --> 00:42:04,422
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's just nice.

562
00:42:04,782 --> 00:42:06,683
[SPEAKER_04]: And you don't have to have a headset and

563
00:42:07,307 --> 00:42:07,948
[SPEAKER_04]: And guess what?

564
00:42:08,168 --> 00:42:10,152
[SPEAKER_04]: The Xbox Live Silver package, that's free.

565
00:42:10,813 --> 00:42:15,239
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's not really a big... Well, that actually is packaged on the regular one, too.

566
00:42:15,279 --> 00:42:20,307
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it didn't make the story here on the site, but I read it somewhere else that the Xbox Live Silver will be on both sets.

567
00:42:20,367 --> 00:42:21,129
[SPEAKER_05]: So at least you get that.

568
00:42:21,509 --> 00:42:21,930
[SPEAKER_05]: What would you do?

569
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:31,664
[SPEAKER_05]: What strikes me as interesting though, okay, I maybe understand why they omitted the hard drive from the Xbox 360, because honestly, how often did you use it with the original Xbox?

570
00:42:31,744 --> 00:42:35,785
[SPEAKER_05]: Granted, you could load your own songs, but how many games really supported that?

571
00:42:36,025 --> 00:42:36,646
[SPEAKER_05]: Not a lot.

572
00:42:37,386 --> 00:42:42,568
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, we put on a bunch of Initial D soundtracks from, what was it, Midnight Club?

573
00:42:43,374 --> 00:42:46,077
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but how... but not a lot of games supported it.

574
00:42:46,838 --> 00:42:48,099
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, a few, but not a lot.

575
00:42:48,619 --> 00:42:53,905
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um, it's not like you could... a lot of games use the hard drive for their data.

576
00:42:53,965 --> 00:42:58,950
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's saved, but nothing that a memory card wouldn't be able to fit unless you're a real hardcore gamer.

577
00:42:59,711 --> 00:42:59,771
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

578
00:43:01,109 --> 00:43:07,494
[SPEAKER_05]: But now I'm thinking, okay, but now you're also talking with Xbox 360 that Final Fantasy XI is one of your big titles.

579
00:43:07,874 --> 00:43:11,597
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to have a hard drive for Final Fantasy XI because of all the freaking patches they do.

580
00:43:12,218 --> 00:43:13,819
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you want to play Final Fantasy XI...

581
00:43:16,018 --> 00:43:16,959
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah, most likely.

582
00:43:17,399 --> 00:43:20,120
[SPEAKER_05]: So, just very interesting there.

583
00:43:21,441 --> 00:43:25,803
[SPEAKER_05]: Really, to play all the really big games, you're going to have to chuck down the $400 anyway.

584
00:43:26,203 --> 00:43:32,827
[SPEAKER_05]: I suppose maybe if you just want Madden, you're just a light gamer, maybe the $300 one will do you.

585
00:43:33,187 --> 00:43:39,911
[SPEAKER_05]: But most people that listen to this program probably consider themselves hardcore enough where that $300 set just doesn't cut it.

586
00:43:40,751 --> 00:43:42,792
[SPEAKER_05]: So, very interesting.

587
00:43:43,252 --> 00:43:44,493
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, any other thoughts on that?

588
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:47,822
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, I know I'm going to have to get the premium.

589
00:43:47,862 --> 00:43:48,342
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to.

590
00:43:48,402 --> 00:43:51,846
[SPEAKER_05]: I want the HD cables and I want the wireless controller and the hard drive.

591
00:43:52,286 --> 00:43:53,668
[SPEAKER_05]: So I have to check down the $400.

592
00:43:54,749 --> 00:43:57,993
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm just kind of... Well, in the end, it's a better economical decision anyway.

593
00:43:58,333 --> 00:44:00,775
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I guess, but $400 is still a lot of money.

594
00:44:00,876 --> 00:44:05,781
[SPEAKER_05]: But I suppose most systems were around $400 when they first came out anyway, so...

595
00:44:07,695 --> 00:44:10,956
[SPEAKER_01]: They lost a lot of money when the Xbox first came out.

596
00:44:11,416 --> 00:44:24,460
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this is a way for them to make something that looks a little bit more affordable and attractive for the casual gamer or for someone who doesn't have a lot of money or doesn't have the high-definition setup you or I have.

597
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:28,661
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes it a little bit more affordable, makes it a little bit more attractive.

598
00:44:29,441 --> 00:44:33,742
[SPEAKER_01]: And then for those of us who have all this stuff, who would lay down that kind of money...

599
00:44:34,639 --> 00:44:37,801
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they're like, hey, we've got some goodies for you, we'll save you some money.

600
00:44:37,921 --> 00:44:46,007
[SPEAKER_05]: I suppose what makes some of us angsty out there is that we're looking at this going, oh man, you mean we gotta pay $100 for the stuff we need anyway?

601
00:44:46,607 --> 00:44:47,328
[SPEAKER_05]: As gamers?

602
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:51,631
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's where we kind of feel like, oh jeez, we're being nickeled and dimed again.

603
00:44:51,931 --> 00:44:53,032
[SPEAKER_05]: But I understand what you're saying.

604
00:44:53,072 --> 00:45:00,597
[SPEAKER_05]: By having the $300 set, it makes Xbox 360 more accessible, so to speak, to a broader game audience.

605
00:45:00,617 --> 00:45:04,300
[SPEAKER_05]: Those folks that, you know, they just want the new Madden game or, you know, whatever it is.

606
00:45:05,267 --> 00:45:07,769
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a really smart move on Microsoft's part.

607
00:45:07,869 --> 00:45:08,309
[SPEAKER_01]: I really do.

608
00:45:08,589 --> 00:45:11,011
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we shall see when the sales figures come out, shall we?

609
00:45:12,071 --> 00:45:12,372
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yes.

610
00:45:12,452 --> 00:45:13,772
[SPEAKER_01]: I will be paying attention to that.

611
00:45:14,273 --> 00:45:20,196
[SPEAKER_01]: I read a really neat article in Time about the 360.

612
00:45:20,957 --> 00:45:23,779
[SPEAKER_01]: This article came out about the time that we were all at E3.

613
00:45:23,799 --> 00:45:28,461
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just saying about how much money they lost on it.

614
00:45:28,501 --> 00:45:32,704
[SPEAKER_01]: With the design of the system, they designed something that would be attractive...

615
00:45:33,137 --> 00:45:34,758
[SPEAKER_01]: to the Japanese market as well.

616
00:45:35,439 --> 00:45:39,402
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I'd love to see if they're going to be doing the same thing there that they are here.

617
00:45:40,403 --> 00:45:40,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

618
00:45:41,624 --> 00:45:42,024
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that?

619
00:45:42,825 --> 00:45:44,726
[SPEAKER_01]: About having the multiple packages.

620
00:45:46,147 --> 00:45:46,427
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

621
00:45:46,568 --> 00:45:48,189
[SPEAKER_01]: The with and without package, basically.

622
00:45:48,729 --> 00:45:49,069
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

623
00:45:49,390 --> 00:45:49,670
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

624
00:45:50,117 --> 00:45:50,417
[SPEAKER_05]: OriginXbox360.com

625
00:46:10,882 --> 00:46:13,744
[SPEAKER_04]: What's interesting is there's a timer counting down.

626
00:46:13,944 --> 00:46:18,287
[SPEAKER_04]: And what's also interesting is that the domain was registered by Microsoft.

627
00:46:19,748 --> 00:46:24,691
[SPEAKER_05]: So is it another one of those big, like, you know, we like bees or whatever that site was called.

628
00:46:24,751 --> 00:46:25,071
[SPEAKER_04]: I love bees.

629
00:46:25,091 --> 00:46:25,951
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, viral campaigns.

630
00:46:26,372 --> 00:46:34,797
[SPEAKER_04]: Possibly the website by, you know, people looking at it, they figured out that it's going to end on September 27th, I believe, at...

631
00:46:37,932 --> 00:46:42,455
[SPEAKER_04]: 12 Eastern and no one really knows what the hell it is.

632
00:46:42,535 --> 00:46:44,076
[SPEAKER_04]: They just know that it's a countdown thing.

633
00:46:44,196 --> 00:46:51,101
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got this kind of a picture of a tree and it's cut out of a bunny and it looks Xbox 360 will have bunny love?

634
00:46:55,204 --> 00:46:57,705
[SPEAKER_05]: That's their answer to Nintendogs.

635
00:46:57,885 --> 00:46:58,626
[SPEAKER_05]: Micro bunnies.

636
00:47:01,648 --> 00:47:02,148
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

637
00:47:02,308 --> 00:47:03,629
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm laughing now but

638
00:47:04,761 --> 00:47:06,242
[SPEAKER_04]: You know something like that could actually happen.

639
00:47:06,282 --> 00:47:08,163
[SPEAKER_05]: You know something like that could actually happen.

640
00:47:08,183 --> 00:47:09,623
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be their answer to Nintendogs.

641
00:47:09,643 --> 00:47:10,524
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be Microbunnies.

642
00:47:10,564 --> 00:47:11,444
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Microbunnies.

643
00:47:11,484 --> 00:47:16,907
[SPEAKER_04]: You turn around, you walk away, you get something to drink, you come back, there's 400 of them on the screen.

644
00:47:18,108 --> 00:47:19,328
[SPEAKER_01]: And what are we going to get next?

645
00:47:19,448 --> 00:47:20,189
[SPEAKER_01]: Playcats?

646
00:47:21,349 --> 00:47:21,850
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, God.

647
00:47:21,950 --> 00:47:27,993
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, so there's some weird site, and it's basically you can access it at www.

648
00:47:29,366 --> 00:47:37,329
[SPEAKER_04]: Origin, and this is O-R-I-G-N Xbox360.com And you've got the countdown here.

649
00:47:37,349 --> 00:47:38,309
[SPEAKER_04]: You can go check it out.

650
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:39,789
[SPEAKER_04]: Figure out what it's about.

651
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:40,690
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?

652
00:47:41,870 --> 00:47:42,510
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of weird.

653
00:47:43,291 --> 00:47:43,871
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyways.

654
00:47:45,086 --> 00:47:51,709
[SPEAKER_04]: Then on to the subject of something else, which would be the Nintendo Revolution.

655
00:47:52,549 --> 00:48:01,492
[SPEAKER_04]: There has been a comment made by Peter Mullenux at Lionhead Studios, the studio behind Black and White and Fable.

656
00:48:03,573 --> 00:48:11,476
[SPEAKER_04]: He's basically quizzed at some European games convention about the revolution.

657
00:48:11,676 --> 00:48:13,777
[SPEAKER_04]: He's basically said this, and this is his quote.

658
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:20,302
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a line at the end of the book, Game Over, and it is, Never underestimate Nintendo.

659
00:48:20,562 --> 00:48:22,264
[SPEAKER_04]: That is all I can say about the controller.

660
00:48:23,825 --> 00:48:24,826
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm.

661
00:48:25,006 --> 00:48:26,467
[SPEAKER_05]: Things that make you go, hmm.

662
00:48:26,507 --> 00:48:27,728
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, basically, you know what?

663
00:48:27,848 --> 00:48:31,110
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been the same thing from all these other different publishers I've been looking at.

664
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:35,873
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like, I can't say anything under strict NDR, but don't count them out.

665
00:48:36,874 --> 00:48:37,455
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

666
00:48:37,755 --> 00:48:39,616
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll have to wait until the end of the year to find out.

667
00:48:40,537 --> 00:48:41,938
[SPEAKER_05]: You know that Nintendo's kind of been...

668
00:48:42,737 --> 00:48:54,881
[SPEAKER_05]: With the DS, they kind of changed the controller a little bit, because the controller is a pen, and you never really saw that in a gaming system before, so Nintendo's kind of been on this kick lately, so it'll be very interesting to see what happens.

669
00:48:55,661 --> 00:48:57,002
[SPEAKER_01]: They're bringing back the U-Force!

670
00:48:57,382 --> 00:48:57,962
[SPEAKER_05]: No, God, no.

671
00:48:58,002 --> 00:48:58,222
[SPEAKER_05]: No!

672
00:48:58,382 --> 00:49:00,203
[SPEAKER_05]: How about the Power Glove?

673
00:49:00,263 --> 00:49:00,843
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so bad.

674
00:49:00,863 --> 00:49:01,683
[SPEAKER_05]: The Activator!

675
00:49:02,243 --> 00:49:02,563
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

676
00:49:03,164 --> 00:49:04,344
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything else you got for us tonight, Loki?

677
00:49:04,784 --> 00:49:06,065
[SPEAKER_04]: And finally... Yes.

678
00:49:06,725 --> 00:49:08,725
[SPEAKER_04]: Happy birthday to you!

679
00:49:09,086 --> 00:49:10,186
[SPEAKER_04]: Happy birthday, Mario, you're 20.

680
00:49:11,923 --> 00:49:13,224
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, he's still youngin'.

681
00:49:13,785 --> 00:49:14,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, he's a youngin'.

682
00:49:14,506 --> 00:49:16,568
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got a lot to learn.

683
00:49:16,588 --> 00:49:24,737
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo has officially launched the Mario's happy birthday site, nintendo.co.jp slash mario20th.

684
00:49:24,857 --> 00:49:25,097
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

685
00:49:27,139 --> 00:49:30,963
[SPEAKER_05]: And on behalf of Orange Lounge Radio, we'd like to apologize to Mario.

686
00:49:31,023 --> 00:49:33,526
[SPEAKER_05]: We are sorry, but your cake is in another castle.

687
00:49:36,256 --> 00:49:40,599
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a mushroom cake It'll actually be coming out

688
00:50:05,768 --> 00:50:06,228
[SPEAKER_05]: In September.

689
00:50:07,328 --> 00:50:08,388
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you know a release date for this?

690
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:10,109
[SPEAKER_05]: It's mid-September.

691
00:50:10,949 --> 00:50:18,250
[SPEAKER_05]: Dig Dug is armed with a collection of weapons such as rocks, lava, and quicksand to defeat the baddies that are in his way.

692
00:50:18,350 --> 00:50:19,210
[SPEAKER_05]: So that should be interesting.

693
00:50:20,010 --> 00:50:21,511
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, multiplayer.

694
00:50:21,531 --> 00:50:23,111
[SPEAKER_01]: Junior assistant Mr. Driller.

695
00:50:23,931 --> 00:50:25,331
[SPEAKER_05]: They are saying multiplayer.

696
00:50:25,411 --> 00:50:27,052
[SPEAKER_05]: Two players in this game.

697
00:50:27,472 --> 00:50:28,292
[SPEAKER_05]: So it should be interesting.

698
00:50:29,392 --> 00:50:30,132
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll be really cool.

699
00:50:30,232 --> 00:50:31,472
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you have any other stories for us tonight?

700
00:50:31,512 --> 00:50:31,993
[SPEAKER_01]: I have that.

701
00:50:34,173 --> 00:50:34,473
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry?

702
00:50:35,427 --> 00:50:35,947
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura.com

703
00:51:02,901 --> 00:51:04,262
[SPEAKER_05]: Core Hotels.

704
00:51:04,782 --> 00:51:09,344
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a hotel chain in Southern California and it's one of those really swanky hotel things.

705
00:51:09,885 --> 00:51:13,626
[SPEAKER_05]: They offer a PlayStation 2 and PSP.

706
00:51:14,066 --> 00:51:20,349
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically what it is is that if you stay in their rooms you get free use of a PSP handheld or a PlayStation 2.

707
00:51:21,030 --> 00:51:21,510
[SPEAKER_05]: Get this.

708
00:51:22,010 --> 00:51:26,932
[SPEAKER_05]: Each hotel has a resident game butler who helps you install and use the systems.

709
00:51:26,993 --> 00:51:28,053
[SPEAKER_05]: How would that be for a job?

710
00:51:28,113 --> 00:51:29,914
[SPEAKER_05]: Being the game butler at one of these hotels?

711
00:51:30,394 --> 00:51:31,034
[SPEAKER_05]: Very interesting.

712
00:51:31,395 --> 00:51:32,095
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, if you're...

713
00:51:33,357 --> 00:51:46,122
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're thinking that this is a good way to check out one of these systems, think again, because staying at core hotels will cost you well over several hundred dollars per night, so you might as well just buy yourself a PlayStation 2 or a PSP.

714
00:51:46,923 --> 00:51:48,083
[SPEAKER_04]: I can top that.

715
00:51:48,663 --> 00:51:49,644
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, what do you have?

716
00:51:51,724 --> 00:51:55,946
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just been announced that... I've got one more story.

717
00:51:56,286 --> 00:51:59,387
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no, I want to save mine for last, because mine's great.

718
00:51:59,848 --> 00:52:00,388
[SPEAKER_05]: You read yours.

719
00:52:01,277 --> 00:52:06,601
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, Nokia will just try anything to get their product out there.

720
00:52:06,682 --> 00:52:12,126
[SPEAKER_04]: So Nokia, to combat the PSP being a hotel, they have the Nokia N-Gage Deck Chair.

721
00:52:12,546 --> 00:52:14,828
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right, folks, the N-Gage Deck Chair.

722
00:52:15,649 --> 00:52:21,774
[SPEAKER_04]: What you can do, basically, is they're going to be putting these out at different venues out there.

723
00:52:22,275 --> 00:52:22,415
[SPEAKER_04]: And...

724
00:52:24,517 --> 00:52:35,527
[SPEAKER_04]: What's going to happen is they're actually going to be sitting in a chair with a crappy umbrella attached to it and this crappy end gauge attached to it.

725
00:52:36,047 --> 00:52:37,589
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like crap.

726
00:52:38,269 --> 00:52:45,496
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be touring a number of festivals including Carleen Leeds and Reading Festival.

727
00:52:45,796 --> 00:52:46,857
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never heard of it.

728
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:47,397
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever.

729
00:52:47,898 --> 00:52:50,300
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, folks, it's going to suck.

730
00:52:51,021 --> 00:52:51,121
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

731
00:52:54,111 --> 00:52:56,072
[SPEAKER_05]: Even the deck chair looks uncomfortable.

732
00:52:56,152 --> 00:52:58,212
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like the deck chair was put together wrong.

733
00:52:58,252 --> 00:52:58,732
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what's funny?

734
00:52:58,772 --> 00:53:02,013
[SPEAKER_05]: I went to IHOP today and I saw somebody playing an N-Gage.

735
00:53:02,853 --> 00:53:07,134
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's probably only the second time I have ever seen somebody playing an N-Gage.

736
00:53:07,154 --> 00:53:08,235
[SPEAKER_05]: Their parents don't love them.

737
00:53:08,515 --> 00:53:09,375
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it was like an adult.

738
00:53:09,655 --> 00:53:12,436
[SPEAKER_05]: Like an upper 20s looking guy.

739
00:53:12,756 --> 00:53:15,456
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's probably only the second time I've ever seen somebody playing an N-Gage.

740
00:53:15,496 --> 00:53:18,477
[SPEAKER_05]: Like not in a GameStop demo or something.

741
00:53:19,077 --> 00:53:19,397
[SPEAKER_05]: Crazy.

742
00:53:19,597 --> 00:53:20,137
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

743
00:53:20,338 --> 00:53:22,138
[SPEAKER_01]: In the N-Gage's defense...

744
00:53:23,047 --> 00:53:25,408
[SPEAKER_01]: A system is only as good as the games that are on it.

745
00:53:26,668 --> 00:53:29,528
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, it doesn't really have any good games anyway.

746
00:53:30,449 --> 00:53:34,949
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, now, DarkSakura, you tell me which story was better, Loki's final story or my final story.

747
00:53:36,010 --> 00:53:39,810
[SPEAKER_05]: Linda Carter will be joining the cast of Elder Scrolls 4.

748
00:53:39,951 --> 00:53:42,811
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, Wonder Woman!

749
00:53:42,871 --> 00:53:43,531
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, that's right.

750
00:53:43,591 --> 00:53:51,093
[SPEAKER_05]: Linda Carter, best known as Wonder Woman, or should I say Wonder Woman, is going to be joining the cast of this game, Elder Scrolls 4.

751
00:53:51,173 --> 00:53:51,253
[SPEAKER_05]: And

752
00:53:52,652 --> 00:53:54,433
[SPEAKER_05]: What else do you really need to know about the game?

753
00:53:54,673 --> 00:53:56,695
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, seriously, it's got Wonder Woman in it.

754
00:53:56,775 --> 00:53:57,235
[SPEAKER_05]: Who cares?

755
00:53:59,076 --> 00:53:59,616
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, fine.

756
00:53:59,636 --> 00:54:00,857
[SPEAKER_05]: That is freaking awesome.

757
00:54:00,997 --> 00:54:03,839
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, you know, a role-playing game, basically.

758
00:54:05,059 --> 00:54:10,523
[SPEAKER_05]: You're in this fantasy realm of Tamriel where the gates to a hellish underworld are going to be opened.

759
00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:12,624
[SPEAKER_04]: But never fear, Wonder Woman is here.

760
00:54:12,644 --> 00:54:15,185
[SPEAKER_05]: But never fear, Wonder Woman's here with her golden lasso.

761
00:54:15,205 --> 00:54:16,426
[SPEAKER_01]: With her golden lasso.

762
00:54:16,646 --> 00:54:17,007
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

763
00:54:18,167 --> 00:54:18,788
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?

764
00:54:18,808 --> 00:54:19,268
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm-hmm.

765
00:54:19,941 --> 00:54:20,622
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait, directed by?

766
00:54:50,055 --> 00:54:53,158
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe... Written by Joss.

767
00:54:53,218 --> 00:54:54,019
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool.

768
00:54:54,119 --> 00:54:58,804
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't send me hate mail if I'm wrong, but I believe it's written and directed by the one and only Joss.

769
00:54:58,824 --> 00:54:59,945
[SPEAKER_05]: So you puffy fans.

770
00:54:59,965 --> 00:55:02,167
[SPEAKER_01]: Then that means it's going to be done fabulously well.

771
00:55:02,207 --> 00:55:04,569
[SPEAKER_01]: He was also writing X-Men for a little while.

772
00:55:04,730 --> 00:55:05,250
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well...

773
00:55:07,045 --> 00:55:10,367
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll save that to the Buffy fans podcast, if there is one.

774
00:55:10,447 --> 00:55:12,228
[SPEAKER_05]: I would think there's got to be a Buffy podcast out there.

775
00:55:12,248 --> 00:55:13,268
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to go look for one right now.

776
00:55:14,429 --> 00:55:14,789
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

777
00:55:14,929 --> 00:55:17,830
[SPEAKER_05]: That sounds like a waste of time.

778
00:55:18,631 --> 00:55:24,134
[SPEAKER_05]: It's time for the final thoughts before DarkSakura jumps through the sky blind and strangles Loki for knocking Buffy.

779
00:55:24,934 --> 00:55:26,055
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, your final thought.

780
00:55:26,095 --> 00:55:31,197
[SPEAKER_04]: Did that guy actually come up with the really retarded concept of an invisible flying jet?

781
00:55:32,738 --> 00:55:32,918
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

782
00:55:34,042 --> 00:55:35,684
[SPEAKER_04]: Why couldn't you just make her fly?

783
00:55:36,084 --> 00:55:37,846
[SPEAKER_04]: An invisible jet is retarded.

784
00:55:39,047 --> 00:55:41,389
[SPEAKER_01]: Because she's an Amazon or something.

785
00:55:41,409 --> 00:55:43,191
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, so she can't fly.

786
00:55:43,571 --> 00:55:44,212
[SPEAKER_04]: She's a woman.

787
00:55:44,252 --> 00:55:45,513
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why she can't fly.

788
00:55:46,774 --> 00:55:47,114
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey!

789
00:55:49,236 --> 00:55:50,157
[SPEAKER_04]: She has to fly a jet.

790
00:55:50,417 --> 00:55:51,478
[SPEAKER_05]: She's going to punch you next week.

791
00:55:53,543 --> 00:56:20,031
