Orange lounge radio to go edition week of august 29th 2005

00:06.000 --> 00:10.920
You're tuned in to the orange lounge radio to go edition your podcast

00:10.920 --> 00:17.840
Hope for all the latest video game news and gamer chat now here your hosts dark, sakura sky and low

00:19.920 --> 00:23.520
Hello everybody out there who subscribe to our podcast

00:24.120 --> 00:26.880
Welcome to the orange lounge radio to go edition

00:26.880 --> 00:30.960
your home for chat about video games that don't suck and

00:30.960 --> 00:34.700
sometimes we do have to talk about those games that do suck but only to tell you

00:34.700 --> 00:35.480
to avoid them

00:35.480 --> 00:39.240
my name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Skye. Not joining us tonight

00:39.240 --> 00:43.560
is the one and only DarkSakura. As you know DarkSakura is getting married this

00:43.560 --> 00:45.600
next week if you listen to previous podcasts

00:45.600 --> 00:48.760
so she's taking care of some pre-planning parties

00:48.760 --> 00:53.320
also we should probably mention that DarkSakura actually has some family

00:53.320 --> 00:56.560
that's actually in the path of Hurricane Katrina right now so

00:56.560 --> 01:02.560
We're sure that not just Dark Sakura's family, but some of our listeners are, in fact, probably in the area where

01:02.560 --> 01:08.560
Hurricane Katrina is expected to land, so definitely our thoughts are with you guys, and we really hope for the best for you guys.

01:08.560 --> 01:11.560
Joining us tonight as well, though, is the one and only Loki.

01:11.560 --> 01:13.560
Yes, I'm here.

01:13.560 --> 01:14.560
How you doin'?

01:14.560 --> 01:15.560
I'm...awake.

01:15.560 --> 01:16.560
Yes?

01:16.560 --> 01:17.560
I think.

01:17.560 --> 01:18.560
Busy week?

01:18.560 --> 01:21.560
Uh, no, but this week will be.

01:21.560 --> 01:22.560
What do you got goin' on this next week?

01:22.560 --> 01:25.560
I've got 19 game publishers coming to my work this week.

01:25.560 --> 01:30.000
19 game publishers now for those folks that don't know what Loki does he does

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
he does freely talk about his work on here and you even have co-workers to

01:33.000 --> 01:35.320
listen to this show huh yeah and they don't care that you talk about this

01:35.320 --> 01:40.160
stuff no oh cool well then tell them what you do I'm I work for a video

01:40.160 --> 01:46.120
distribution company called VPD second largest in the United States and I'm one

01:46.120 --> 01:51.680
of the game sales reps there so you know basically we've got these game holders

01:51.680 --> 01:55.320
coming in to check out what the company is about because they've you know they're

01:55.320 --> 01:58.520
They're not familiar with VPD, they just know the old company that we bought out, which

01:58.520 --> 02:03.960
was VBC, Video by Cyclings, so they're going to come check out the place.

02:03.960 --> 02:08.720
On Tuesday they're having a party for them, they're going to be bringing in foosball tables,

02:08.720 --> 02:13.360
pool tables, barbecue, you know, that kind of stuff.

02:13.360 --> 02:17.880
And then on Wednesday we get a whole presentation by all of them, like what games are coming

02:17.880 --> 02:20.140
out in the fourth quarter, and all that fun stuff.

02:20.140 --> 02:21.920
So next week's show should be a really good one.

02:21.920 --> 02:22.920
Should be fun, yeah.

02:22.920 --> 02:23.920
You're gonna be in on all this.

02:23.920 --> 02:26.780
Monday I'm looking forward to because Activision's coming out because they can't make it for

02:26.780 --> 02:27.780
the other stuff.

02:27.780 --> 02:31.280
So they're coming out on Monday to show us like, Gun and stuff like that, which, Gun

02:31.280 --> 02:34.680
is going to be next to Grand Theft Auto basically, but in the old west.

02:34.680 --> 02:35.680
What's Gun?

02:35.680 --> 02:36.680
I haven't heard, I have not heard of that.

02:36.680 --> 02:41.600
Gun is pretty much, it's an open kind of action game, very similar to Grand Theft Auto where

02:41.600 --> 02:45.200
it's very, you can do whatever you want pretty much, and they have a main story that goes

02:45.200 --> 02:47.360
along with that, but it's set in the wild west.

02:47.360 --> 02:52.920
So you can go mine gold, you can go, you know, scalp people, you can just do all that sort

02:52.920 --> 02:56.880
So it's like Deadwood, that show on HBO, kind of?

02:56.880 --> 02:58.820
It's like Red Dead Revolver, but...

02:58.820 --> 03:02.560
It's set in the Wild West, but they all say, you know, cocksucker and stuff in the words

03:02.560 --> 03:03.960
that they didn't say in the Wild West?

03:03.960 --> 03:05.960
I don't know, I don't know.

03:05.960 --> 03:08.160
Not quite, but it's gonna be good.

03:08.160 --> 03:09.160
M-rated, definitely.

03:09.160 --> 03:10.160
Definitely.

03:10.160 --> 03:11.160
We'll see.

03:11.160 --> 03:12.160
All right, so next week should be a good show.

03:12.160 --> 03:16.400
But you know, it's kind of cool that we have you as a part of this program, because, you

03:16.400 --> 03:21.780
know, we told you guys like a month ago about Final Fantasy Advent Children getting delayed,

03:21.780 --> 03:25.300
And suddenly this week everybody else is like, oh by the way, Final Fantasy Advent Children

03:25.300 --> 03:26.300
is getting delayed.

03:26.300 --> 03:27.300
Yeah, no shit.

03:27.300 --> 03:28.300
I wonder where they got that rumor from.

03:28.300 --> 03:29.500
Oh, that might be me.

03:29.500 --> 03:30.500
That's right.

03:30.500 --> 03:34.180
They're all, yeah, we read it on that site, Advent Children, yeah, because I, or Advent

03:34.180 --> 03:35.180
Children dot net.

03:35.180 --> 03:40.520
Yeah, because I posted it on there, you dumbass, but no, everybody still doesn't believe that's

03:40.520 --> 03:41.520
coming out that day.

03:41.520 --> 03:47.140
I'm hearing, I can't remember who the hell I heard this from, I want to say it might

03:47.140 --> 03:54.620
even been you, um, but about why Advent Children's being delayed? I... The rumor? Okay, rumor

03:54.620 --> 04:00.140
of a rumor, guys. Take this with a grain of salt. I... It's one of those, like, friend

04:00.140 --> 04:06.780
friend things. Yeah. That a possible reason why Square's delaying this is that there might...

04:06.780 --> 04:09.260
You know how they're doing a theatrical release in Japan? Well, it's actually, yeah, well,

04:09.260 --> 04:12.660
Sony. Yeah, Sony is one. Okay, whatever. Anyway. You know how they're doing a theatrical release

04:12.660 --> 04:17.740
in Japan right? They want to do that here in the US from what I understand even though

04:17.740 --> 04:21.500
the last Final Fantasy movie didn't do so hot, but the only way they'll do it, limited

04:21.500 --> 04:27.600
IMAX engagement. So, take it with a grain of salt guys, but just imagine the possibilities

04:27.600 --> 04:31.420
and if that's true that it is, I mean, if we're talking limited IMAX engagement, we're

04:31.420 --> 04:36.020
talking very similar to what's going on in Tokyo, not Tokyo, Japan, in cities like Tokyo,

04:36.020 --> 04:39.980
where they are going to be showing it in only like three or four cities for like a week.

04:39.980 --> 04:44.820
That would probably be what happens here, but take it with a grain of salt guys, I don't

04:44.820 --> 04:45.820
know.

04:45.820 --> 04:46.820
I don't know.

04:46.820 --> 04:51.240
Well, either way, it's coming out on November 29th, which is Tuesday, or right before the

04:51.240 --> 04:54.380
holiday month there.

04:54.380 --> 04:59.660
I don't know, I wish it were coming out sooner, but that's the way they told me.

04:59.660 --> 05:01.780
I'm like, ugh, no, why?

05:01.780 --> 05:05.820
Most of the big gaming sites are agreeing with you now, so I was reading them this week.

05:05.820 --> 05:09.100
Well, yeah, I mean, it's been pushed back a few times, so everyone's like, well, the

05:09.100 --> 05:13.300
Square Enix site still saying it's coming out so don't worry yeah well that's because

05:13.300 --> 05:18.860
they have nothing to do with the date that it comes out in so whatever but yeah so that's

05:18.860 --> 05:19.860
what's going on.

05:19.860 --> 05:22.020
All right, all right.

05:22.020 --> 05:25.340
So well let's start off tonight's show by talking about even though we've kind of already

05:25.340 --> 05:28.740
been talking about some games we typically try to get this out in the beginning what

05:28.740 --> 05:32.380
games have we been playing this week so Loki what have you been up to this week?

05:32.380 --> 05:38.220
Well I've been playing a couple things Burnout 3 still of course.

05:38.220 --> 05:44.000
I'm almost done with it because we decided to cheat and unlock everything, so, cause

05:44.000 --> 05:46.840
we got, you know, we got tired of playing the same track over, no, we're still playing

05:46.840 --> 05:52.720
it though, cause we now have really fast cars and it's still even more fun to race, but,

05:52.720 --> 05:59.320
um, I was also playing a little bit of, um, pack picks, I tried that, how was that, I

05:59.320 --> 06:01.380
saw that you picked that up, how was that game?

06:01.380 --> 06:07.840
It was one of those like, random buys I did, and it's okay, I'm just not really kind of

06:07.840 --> 06:13.000
Feeling the game, you know, it's kind of like it was one of those things where I played the tech demo at e3

06:13.000 --> 06:17.480
you know like a couple of what was a year and a half ago when the DS was first being shown and I

06:17.740 --> 06:21.960
Then I heard that they were making it into a game and I was kind of like you're gonna take this concept and make it

06:21.960 --> 06:24.340
An actual game. I mean it see this being a minigame

06:24.860 --> 06:32.240
But from what I understand it came out. Okay, like the best of that concept could but it's it's still it's okay

06:32.380 --> 06:34.380
but it's just like kind of and

06:34.380 --> 06:40.580
And it's like one of those things like oh, but maybe it should be a mini game to something or maybe it should be like

06:40.580 --> 06:42.300
I don't know

06:42.300 --> 06:43.980
Something built into some other game

06:43.980 --> 06:48.660
They should put some of these DS games together like that and Yoshi touch-and-go which was very gimmicky to me too

06:48.660 --> 06:55.540
I mean another day. Well every single pac-man game that comes out is oh, no pac-man's been turned into something else

06:55.540 --> 06:59.080
I mean, it's like, you know, cuz pac-man's just not good enough, you know

06:59.080 --> 07:02.720
So they got to turn him into a ball. I got to turn him into a doodle. They got to turn him into

07:02.720 --> 07:09.680
into something else. It's just, that's what it is. It's really retarded, but it's okay.

07:09.680 --> 07:13.680
I mean, it's probably not worth 30 bucks. I paid for it, but it's still okay.

07:13.680 --> 07:18.420
Wait for the bargain bin. Definitely. For a lot of the DS games, wait for the bargain

07:18.420 --> 07:22.960
bin. 35 is a lot. Well, I don't know. I disagree with you. I think Meteos is definitely worth

07:22.960 --> 07:28.680
the price. Nintendogs, which I'm sure you're about to get to in a minute, is, depending

07:28.680 --> 07:33.980
on if it's your kind of game because you already know if you'd like Nintendo or not honestly

07:33.980 --> 07:38.280
you already know we don't have to tell you if it's a good or bad game you would know

07:38.280 --> 07:42.400
if you like these virtual pet kind of games so sorry to steal your thunder but I'm sure

07:42.400 --> 07:47.120
you've been playing a lot of Nintendo as well I've been playing a little bit and 10 dogs

07:47.120 --> 07:52.600
a little bit yeah I bought all three which why did you buy all three when you can unlock

07:52.600 --> 07:58.440
all the dogs in one cartridge if you just network well enough I don't know I didn't

07:58.440 --> 08:05.440
know that, so I just bought all three. Sucker. You know, whatever, it's okay. Alright. Anything

08:06.640 --> 08:10.660
else you been playing this week? Burnout, Nintendogs? What'd you think of Nintendogs?

08:10.660 --> 08:14.800
Was it everything you'd hoped for? Yeah, but the thing's like kinda needy. It's just, you

08:14.800 --> 08:21.600
know, I just, I don't know, I don't have enough time to play this game and other games at

08:21.600 --> 08:27.400
the same time, so it's, that's kinda tough. Yet you would log into Final Fantasy XI for

08:27.400 --> 08:30.980
hours on end. That wasn't a problem. Yeah, I played a little bit of Final Fantasy

08:30.980 --> 08:36.140
11 this week, okay. I logged in for a couple hours, because I hadn't played for two months,

08:36.140 --> 08:42.580
so I felt obligated. Alright. That's it. That's all I had. That's all the games you've been

08:42.580 --> 08:44.180
playing? That's all I've been playing next week should

08:44.180 --> 08:48.380
be better. Oh, I played Marvel Nemesis Rise of the Imperfects. That was the other one.

08:48.380 --> 08:52.420
It's an awesome fighting game that they're going to be coming out with in September here,

08:52.420 --> 08:55.660
and it's just, I don't know, it's really neat. They've got all the characters, plus they

08:55.660 --> 09:01.620
have these ones that EA actually made up, so that was kind of neat.

09:01.620 --> 09:05.660
Games I've been playing this week, Nintendogs of course, I ran out and picked that one up.

09:05.660 --> 09:09.500
I picked up the one that had the Shih Tzu in it because as I promised everybody out there

09:09.500 --> 09:13.180
I was going to get a Shih Tzu, and I did have a Shih Tzu for a little while, but unfortunately

09:13.180 --> 09:18.740
because I kind of felt I was screwing things up in the way I was training it by making

09:18.740 --> 09:23.780
the voice commands a little too similar to each other, I had to delete my Shih Tzu.

09:23.780 --> 09:28.640
So now I have a new dog, a wiener dog named Oscar, so he's cool.

09:28.640 --> 09:31.980
And Loki's right, they do get pretty needy, I notice you have to kind of feed or give

09:31.980 --> 09:35.180
it water like twice a day.

09:35.180 --> 09:41.220
Now Nintendogs was the game that I said was the best thing I saw at E3, and did it translate

09:41.220 --> 09:44.360
well into a full game, the five minute demo that they had at E3?

09:44.360 --> 09:51.980
I think in most ways yes it did, certainly in the very Nintendo way, the cuteness factor,

09:51.980 --> 09:56.140
the collectability aspect of it that's very, you know, Pokemon-ish and Animal Crossing-ish

09:56.140 --> 09:59.220
and other Nintendo games that they're famous for.

09:59.220 --> 10:04.780
I think it really does deliver on all that, and I really think it's a neat way to kind

10:04.780 --> 10:10.140
of transform the Tamagotchi and Pokemon concept into something that will be very accessible

10:10.140 --> 10:11.140
to a lot of people.

10:11.140 --> 10:13.980
I think it is going to be a very successful game.

10:13.980 --> 10:19.940
My only beef with it is that the actual game elements of it, outside of training your dog,

10:19.940 --> 10:21.660
turn out to be kind of thin.

10:21.660 --> 10:26.600
Granted you have these trial competitions that you can do, the agility trial where you

10:26.600 --> 10:31.460
teach your dog how to jump over hurdles and run through tubes and stuff.

10:31.460 --> 10:35.000
There's the obedience competition which is kind of boring, you just yell voice commands

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
at your dog.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.960
A frisbee competition, I don't remember the exact name of it, but there's a frisbee competition

10:39.960 --> 10:40.960
as well.

10:40.960 --> 10:44.740
Sort of wears a little bit thin, especially the fact that you have to sit through these

10:44.740 --> 10:50.120
two announcers who talk very slowly and have really lame jokes and stuff.

10:50.120 --> 10:53.480
I was also a little bit disappointed that you couldn't do more with the head-to-head

10:53.480 --> 10:57.960
aspect like you couldn't go head-to-head in an agility trial at least if you can I haven't

10:57.960 --> 11:02.040
found this out yet or anything so I was a little disappointed that all you can really

11:02.040 --> 11:05.980
do is exchange and play with each other's dogs although that is a really neat concept

11:05.980 --> 11:10.240
I would have liked to see something maybe a little more competitive you can like I guess

11:10.240 --> 11:15.200
because each game has like the certain items that are in each one right so in order to

11:15.200 --> 11:18.800
get all the items you have to have all the games trade so I guess maybe it's more of

11:18.800 --> 11:22.520
a friendly competition. It's a co-op game instead of a competitive game. I would have

11:22.520 --> 11:27.240
liked to see maybe more ways that you could have pitted dogs up against each other to

11:27.240 --> 11:31.960
see who the better trainer is. But I still think it's a very solid game. I think it's

11:31.960 --> 11:37.920
a very Nintendo game. I think it's going to be a great DS title. And I think if this title

11:37.920 --> 11:41.440
sounds appealing to you, give it the benefit of the doubt. Pick it up. There's a lot of

11:41.440 --> 11:45.160
great deals out there right now. You never know. They might come out later with Nintendogs

11:45.160 --> 11:49.360
training challenge or something, there'll be a revolution game and you'll put your

11:49.360 --> 11:53.520
dogs in. Who knows? Or as we said last week on the show, holiday edition apparently has

11:53.520 --> 11:57.880
been trademarked. Don't know if that's going to be something that actually happens, but

11:57.880 --> 12:02.700
who knows? And I want to talk about DS expansions in one of our stories tonight because it's

12:02.700 --> 12:07.640
very interesting the way they're expanding some of the DS games. Cool. Other than Nintendogs,

12:07.640 --> 12:12.880
I really didn't play a whole lot of new stuff, just Final Fantasy XI. I apologize, Loki,

12:12.880 --> 12:15.200
I didn't get to the copy of Hello Kitty Roller Rescue

12:15.200 --> 12:16.400
that you gave me last week.

12:16.400 --> 12:17.840
I haven't had a chance to hook up the GameCube,

12:17.840 --> 12:21.800
so I'm trying to look for a better cable for it.

12:21.800 --> 12:24.400
I need to get at least an S-video for my Hi-Def TV.

12:25.840 --> 12:27.280
And Halo 2.

12:27.280 --> 12:29.720
Last night, I went over to a friend's birthday party

12:29.720 --> 12:31.720
and it was just a bunch of guys playing Halo 2.

12:31.720 --> 12:34.000
And somehow we got the idea that we'd get our friend

12:34.000 --> 12:35.560
who doesn't really play a lot of video games

12:35.560 --> 12:37.460
but really likes to talk shit.

12:37.460 --> 12:40.440
We'd get him really drunk and he just got online

12:40.440 --> 12:42.080
and my friend who's really good at Halo,

12:42.080 --> 12:43.360
you know, he's like a level 20 something

12:43.360 --> 12:44.600
and all the head-to-head stuff.

12:44.600 --> 12:46.280
We got him to actually control

12:46.280 --> 12:47.840
and my friend to wear the headset.

12:47.840 --> 12:49.960
So he just made fun of people the whole night.

12:49.960 --> 12:51.880
And like made fun of people's names.

12:51.880 --> 12:53.960
He was making fun of people on the same team and stuff.

12:53.960 --> 12:57.660
Highly immature stuff, highly, highly amusing.

12:59.520 --> 13:01.420
It was so funny because there was this girl

13:01.420 --> 13:04.040
who ended up getting more kills than my friend in one match.

13:04.040 --> 13:06.880
Either it was a girl or a little boy

13:06.880 --> 13:08.100
who hadn't gone through puberty yet.

13:08.100 --> 13:09.520
Because the boys was really high like this.

13:09.520 --> 13:12.240
And the person was going, ha ha ha, I beat you, I beat you,

13:12.240 --> 13:14.040
blah, blah, blah, and just doing this dance

13:14.040 --> 13:15.200
in their living room or something

13:15.200 --> 13:17.460
and yelling at us on Xbox Live, so.

13:17.460 --> 13:21.180
The joys of Xbox Live and talking smack.

13:24.440 --> 13:26.480
Not so much fun if you're on the receiving end though,

13:26.480 --> 13:28.080
I bet.

13:28.080 --> 13:30.500
Anyway, let's get to that story about the expansion pack,

13:30.500 --> 13:32.000
actually, I'll start off with this story tonight.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.440
This is actually a game we talked a little bit about

13:34.440 --> 13:36.840
on the show, but I don't know of a US release

13:36.840 --> 13:38.680
of this game yet, it's actually a Japanese game

13:38.680 --> 13:42.100
called Jam with a Band, and it's kind of one of those ones

13:42.100 --> 13:44.440
where you play the instruments on your DS,

13:44.440 --> 13:46.060
and it's an interactive title.

13:46.060 --> 13:47.380
This hasn't come out in the US yet,

13:47.380 --> 13:48.720
but what is coming out in Japan,

13:48.720 --> 13:51.180
apparently the game has been very successful in Japan,

13:51.180 --> 13:54.260
so they're gonna be releasing an expansion pack,

13:54.260 --> 13:55.580
but you have to have the DS game

13:55.580 --> 13:57.020
to be able to use the expansion pack.

13:57.020 --> 13:58.940
The way the expansion pack works,

13:58.940 --> 14:00.760
it's a Game Boy Advance cartridge

14:00.760 --> 14:03.220
that plugs into the bottom slot of your DS,

14:03.220 --> 14:08.040
and so 20 songs are loaded into the DS cartridge,

14:08.040 --> 14:11.860
songs that uh... i don't recognize a whole lot of these songs a lot of them

14:11.860 --> 14:13.600
are uh... japanese titles

14:13.600 --> 14:17.200
uh... except for one of them uh... and that's the new my new my a song is on

14:17.200 --> 14:18.340
here that you know

14:18.340 --> 14:21.200
drago stun tay or whatever's called that's in the expansion pack for jam the

14:21.200 --> 14:21.680
band

14:21.680 --> 14:25.360
uh... along with some nintendo favorite star fox sixty four super mario sixty

14:25.360 --> 14:26.160
four d s

14:26.160 --> 14:29.200
are all in this expansion back but i think that's very what's neat about the

14:29.200 --> 14:33.300
story not so much the game but the method of delivering the expansion

14:33.300 --> 14:36.680
and it's cool that you mentioned that uh... there's another game is coming out

14:36.680 --> 14:44.720
similar to that Metroid Prime pinball they're doing a rumble pack that's gonna

14:44.720 --> 14:48.680
be I know I heard about the rumble pack but is is that a DS game I can't that's

14:48.680 --> 14:51.720
a DS game yeah I thought it was an advanced game first no it's a DS game I

14:51.720 --> 14:55.040
can't keep track okay so it's a DS game but the rumble packs gonna plug into the

14:55.040 --> 15:00.680
it yes like see I knew there was more to that advanced slot than just Game Boy

15:00.680 --> 15:03.420
advanced games if you think about it this goes all the way back to feel the

15:03.420 --> 15:07.420
Magic XXY or whatever it is, one of the launch titles

15:07.420 --> 15:10.340
where, secret trick, if you put in, I think it's

15:10.340 --> 15:13.860
Sonic Adventure 2 in your GBA slot, you unlock

15:13.860 --> 15:16.040
a Sonic costume on the DS cartridge.

15:16.040 --> 15:18.380
So we've known forever the DS has this capability

15:18.380 --> 15:21.500
to interact with whatever game is in the bottom slot.

15:21.500 --> 15:25.380
So if a Nintendogs, hypothetically, if there is

15:25.380 --> 15:27.760
this holiday edition and an expansion pack is delivered,

15:27.760 --> 15:32.220
I'd bet ya either it's gonna be its own stand alone

15:32.220 --> 15:35.040
cartridge where they try to get you to you know buy the same game over again

15:35.040 --> 15:38.280
because you can get cute Santa hats for your puppy or it's going to be an

15:38.280 --> 15:41.520
expansion pack which I think would be very cool imagine an expansion pack that

15:41.520 --> 15:44.840
plugs in advance that would work with all three titles and maybe unlock a

15:44.840 --> 15:48.560
particular breed of dog in no matter what game you own I know it'd be cool

15:48.560 --> 15:53.940
we'll see though we'll see also in the news tonight I was talking about Halo a

15:53.940 --> 15:57.280
little bit ago of course you guys probably heard that Halo is going to be

15:57.280 --> 16:01.200
turned into a movie projected to be about 2007

16:02.200 --> 16:03.200
for this movie to come out.

16:03.200 --> 16:05.260
Fox and Universal were the ones that teamed up

16:05.260 --> 16:06.840
to create this movie.

16:06.840 --> 16:09.960
The script, as I understand, is being written by the guy

16:09.960 --> 16:12.880
who did 28 Days Later, Alex Garland.

16:12.880 --> 16:14.960
But at the same time, he also did The Beach.

16:14.960 --> 16:18.720
So, could be hit or miss, could be hit or miss.

16:18.720 --> 16:19.760
So we'll see, more news.

16:19.760 --> 16:22.400
No stars attached yet, but I'm sure all of that

16:22.400 --> 16:24.440
will develop a little bit later on.

16:24.440 --> 16:26.440
Also, I wanna say about Halo.

16:26.440 --> 16:28.020
This, I think, is very interesting.

16:28.020 --> 16:29.880
There's gonna be a Halo Triple Pack

16:29.880 --> 16:31.280
coming out before the end of the year.

16:31.280 --> 16:33.200
Yeah, it's coming out in October.

16:33.200 --> 16:36.200
It's gonna be $60, or as they say, $59.99,

16:36.200 --> 16:38.160
but I say that's just $60.

16:38.160 --> 16:40.960
It's gonna be Halo, Halo 2,

16:40.960 --> 16:43.400
and the Halo 2 multiplayer map pack.

16:43.400 --> 16:45.920
Now, usually if you bought these games together,

16:45.920 --> 16:47.120
it would cost you about $80,

16:47.120 --> 16:48.880
so it's kinda like, you know, you're getting a combo,

16:48.880 --> 16:50.600
burgers, fries, and soda, right?

16:50.600 --> 16:52.060
But my question is,

16:52.060 --> 16:55.140
who that owns an Xbox

16:55.140 --> 16:58.240
that who would this who's this

16:58.240 --> 17:01.260
more are aimed at because if you own an Xbox

17:01.260 --> 17:05.500
you have to own one of these games unless you're not a first-person shooter

17:05.500 --> 17:06.060
type

17:06.060 --> 17:09.740
but if that's the case I don't know why you own an Xbox but

17:09.740 --> 17:13.380
no it all kidding aside though okay maybe there's no their sports titles

17:13.380 --> 17:15.600
Ninja Gaiden you know there's other Xbox titles that are good

17:15.600 --> 17:18.820
but I'd be very surprised that people who want

17:18.820 --> 17:22.540
Halo don't already have it. The only thing I can come up with is that maybe

17:22.540 --> 17:23.780
this is to kind of

17:23.780 --> 17:27.660
get those people that are gonna make the Xbox 360

17:27.660 --> 17:31.620
their first purchase and since the Xbox 360 they're saying is going to be

17:31.620 --> 17:34.220
backwards compatible now. You know it's gonna be at least backwards compatible

17:34.220 --> 17:35.300
with Halo if nothing else.

17:35.300 --> 17:39.280
It keeps going back and forth. Some games, all games, some games, all games. At least

17:39.280 --> 17:42.460
the Halos will be backwards compatible. This is going to be a good way to get people

17:42.460 --> 17:46.620
you know to catch up on Halo who might be joining Microsoft with the Xbox 360

17:46.620 --> 17:47.580
and didn't have an Xbox.

17:47.580 --> 17:51.980
But my thought along with that is, who's gonna buy an Xbox 360 that

17:51.980 --> 17:55.940
isn't already an Xbox fan? I don't know many people. You don't own an Xbox, right?

17:55.940 --> 17:59.860
No. Are you gonna buy an Xbox 360? Probably just because it's the next-gen system.

17:59.860 --> 18:01.860
Okay, then you're the only person I've talked to

18:01.860 --> 18:04.860
that would plan to be buying an Xbox 360.

18:04.860 --> 18:08.140
I guess there could be other folks out there. I mean, just because, you know,

18:08.140 --> 18:12.100
really, I'm not buying it for Halo. If Halo comes out for it,

18:12.100 --> 18:16.020
I'm not gonna buy it. Are you buying it for Final Fantasy XI, Pretty Edition? No, hell no.

18:16.020 --> 18:20.940
I'm not buying for that. I'm buying for project author racing 3. That's what I'm buying it for that and Ridge Racer 6

18:20.940 --> 18:25.780
Hell yeah, it's all about the racing games. So that's okay. Well, then I guess I stand corrected because

18:26.420 --> 18:31.700
Feasibly with this lower price they could taunt someone like you into buying this. Although you're not a halo fan

18:31.700 --> 18:33.700
I would not buy the stupid halo

18:34.180 --> 18:36.740
Expansion pack and that crap you're not a halo fan

18:36.740 --> 18:42.320
You think about it though halo tooth probably dropping price here pretty quick anyways to about 20 bucks and then they'll be just $60

18:42.320 --> 18:46.400
anyway i disagree halo they're still asking $29.99 for halo 1

18:46.400 --> 18:50.400
no it's not strapped down to $20 I saw it somewhere for $29.99

18:50.400 --> 18:55.240
no but whatever mine came with my xbox i have a pretty green xbox so i didn't

18:55.240 --> 18:55.940
have to worry about it

18:55.940 --> 18:59.000
mine came with mine except on halo it was part of that you know

18:59.000 --> 19:02.720
the best hits or whatever they call them platinum it is and it isn't

19:02.720 --> 19:05.900
you know it's the best selling xbox game of all time but

19:05.900 --> 19:09.920
they can still get away with charging $30 yeah you know see everything in this

19:09.920 --> 19:14.720
this um... collection of ours is supposed to be $17.99 but uh...

19:14.720 --> 19:19.380
we just want some more money for it. Speaking of Xbox 360 another story tonight this is

19:19.380 --> 19:20.400
interesting I think

19:20.400 --> 19:23.560
um... of course we had the price announcements last week where you know

19:23.560 --> 19:25.360
you got three hundred dollar pack, four hundred dollar pack

19:25.360 --> 19:29.600
okay we'll get this some retailers are creating their own bundle packs

19:29.600 --> 19:32.840
uh huh, EB Games. EB Games is one. GameStop

19:32.840 --> 19:36.840
has created a pack and they're calling this the

19:36.840 --> 19:40.080
ultimate Xbox 360 pack.

19:40.080 --> 19:45.760
It comes with a system, Perfect Dark Zero, Project Gotham Racing 3, Elder Scrolls 4,

19:45.760 --> 19:53.200
Dead or Alive 4, Call of Duty 2, Gun, Quake 4, Tony Hawk, Condemned, Madden NFL 06, Cameo,

19:53.200 --> 19:57.360

19:57.360 --> 20:02.160
Live, 1 year product replacement plan, and it will only set you back $1,199.83.

20:02.160 --> 20:04.940
one hundred and ninety nine dollars and eighty three cents yes boys and girls

20:04.940 --> 20:06.500
those one thousand

20:06.500 --> 20:10.400
one hundred ninety nine dollars not even so go lie down your five dollars now

20:10.400 --> 20:14.620
interest that retard fifty dollars at fifty s rise fifty versus the month

20:14.620 --> 20:16.160
retarded

20:16.160 --> 20:18.420
who would buy that crap rich people

20:18.420 --> 20:21.960
i mean seriously though you probably go shopping and get it for a lot cheaper

20:21.960 --> 20:23.080
anyways

20:23.080 --> 20:24.960
well i don't know

20:24.960 --> 20:26.780
did not cut the break this like

20:26.780 --> 20:30.020
let's put it all together make the biggest pack possible the news site you

20:30.020 --> 20:33.820
written and you don't get price breaks released a usually though well you know

20:33.820 --> 20:37.140
what i'm making a pack that's going to be to prove that you know two thousand

20:37.140 --> 20:38.060
four hundred dollars

20:38.060 --> 20:40.740
it twice that

20:40.740 --> 20:42.060
because you know

20:42.060 --> 20:45.420
it comes with two experts exactly i mean using

20:45.420 --> 20:49.720
who needs one xbox three sixty man i don't have to go to another room to play

gonna read this this comes to us from Flynn Flynn says hello I've just heard

21:38.740 --> 21:43.860
my first podcast of your show courtesy of my PSP so I think it's very

21:43.860 --> 21:47.460
interesting that he's downloading the show on the PSP because we're gonna if

21:47.460 --> 21:52.020
you're a PSP owner we're gonna do something for you guys but we we're not

21:52.020 --> 21:55.740
talking about it just yet we're working on it hopefully within the month oh yeah

21:55.740 --> 21:59.980
Yeah, by the way, I forgot to mention this earlier this week, I bought another PSP.

21:59.980 --> 22:01.380
So I have two PSPs now.

22:01.380 --> 22:02.380
Sucker.

22:02.380 --> 22:03.380
Alright, anyway.

22:03.380 --> 22:06.820
So hello to those of you listening on your PSPs, we're gonna do something for you guys

22:06.820 --> 22:08.820
pretty soon.

22:08.820 --> 22:12.580
Flynn wanted to comment on what a listener named Rob had to say about virtual ethics

22:12.580 --> 22:17.300
in regards to the Chinese exchange student using a bot to mug other players in Lineage

22:17.300 --> 22:21.300
2 and sell their virtual loot for real cash.

22:21.300 --> 22:27.940
Rob went on to say that virtual ethics, or ethics in not a real place, are inconsequential.

22:27.940 --> 22:28.940
I can't talk tonight.

22:28.940 --> 22:30.820
Too many syllables in that word.

22:30.820 --> 22:34.900
I'm thinking about that Xbox DS and I'm seeing dollar signs all over, anyway.

22:34.900 --> 22:39.100
Flynn says, there's a famous saying, ethics is what you do in the dark when no one's watching.

22:39.100 --> 22:42.960
I can think of no darker a place than cyberspace where no one can watch.

22:42.960 --> 22:46.780
Would you empty the contents of a lost wallet if no one knew you had it, or would you track

22:46.780 --> 22:50.480
down the owner to return the wallet, knowing no reward would be given and they would never

22:50.480 --> 22:52.240
find you if you did not.

22:52.240 --> 22:55.560
Having never played Lineage 2, I can only assume that mugging and player killing are

22:55.560 --> 22:59.560
part of the many wonderful experiences you can participate in during the game and that

22:59.560 --> 23:02.720
the student had not hacked the program in order to create these things.

23:02.720 --> 23:06.920
I actually tried to do a little research on it, well let me finish this letter.

23:06.920 --> 23:10.240
I have also heard of people creating things in the virtual world to auction off for real

23:10.240 --> 23:12.720
cash and as far as I know this is not illegal.

23:12.720 --> 23:17.680
That being said, mugging and PKing and selling virtual loot in the real world should not

23:17.680 --> 23:19.500
have led to an arrest in my opinion.

23:19.500 --> 23:22.300
The only crime was maybe the creation of the bot program.

23:22.300 --> 23:24.100
However, everyone should be crystal clear

23:24.100 --> 23:26.220
in that his actions were unethical.

23:26.220 --> 23:27.500
Do not believe for one second

23:27.500 --> 23:30.180
that you are a good upstanding citizen in the real world

23:30.180 --> 23:32.660
while treating people like garbage in the virtual world.

23:32.660 --> 23:33.660
Very good point.

23:33.660 --> 23:35.780
Doing awful things while hiding behind a screen name

23:35.780 --> 23:38.740
or handle is just revealing your true nature in the dark.

23:38.740 --> 23:40.380
That comes to us from Flynn.

23:40.380 --> 23:41.220
Thank you for the email, Flynn.

23:41.220 --> 23:43.180
I actually tried to do a little research

23:43.180 --> 23:46.540
as to whether Lineage 2 has that mugging feature built in.

23:46.540 --> 23:48.980
So I went to Google, you know, like Lineage 2 mugging.

23:48.980 --> 23:52.900
And of course I just got a bunch of articles but I tried reading some, doing a little research

23:52.900 --> 23:55.620
trying to see if mugging is something that's built into the game.

23:55.620 --> 23:59.380
It's my understanding that although it sounds like PK is something that's built into the

23:59.380 --> 24:05.500
game, what this person did is the person wrote a bot program to automate doing all of these

24:05.500 --> 24:10.260
quests and doing things faster than a human can possibly do them.

24:10.260 --> 24:12.440
So the bot would always win.

24:12.440 --> 24:14.380
No matter what, the bot would win.

24:14.380 --> 24:16.280
And the bot was basically unkillable.

24:16.280 --> 24:20.680
So in a way he kind of, I guess, brought an exploit to light.

24:20.680 --> 24:24.440
I don't know what you'd call it, but I definitely agree with Flynn that it was unethical, but

24:24.440 --> 24:28.680
Flynn says maybe they went a little far in arresting the guy.

24:28.680 --> 24:29.680
Your thoughts are welcome.

24:29.680 --> 24:31.480
TwoGo at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

24:31.480 --> 24:35.480
I don't know about unethical, I mean, because one could say if you create a better way of

24:35.480 --> 24:40.400
doing something that's unethical, but I call it, you know, innovative.

24:40.400 --> 24:41.400
You know what, though?

24:41.400 --> 24:42.400
You know what, though?

24:42.400 --> 24:43.400
There's a difference.

24:43.400 --> 24:45.480
You're talking about cheating in Burnout 3 in single-player mode, right?

24:45.480 --> 24:50.240
you what you were doing earlier this week that's I downloaded a save that's

24:50.240 --> 24:53.840
that's different because you're only affecting your game if you want to just

24:53.840 --> 24:57.160
like if you want to go on to what is it movie spoilers calm or whatever that

24:57.160 --> 25:01.480
site is and you want to read the end to every movie that's out there go for it

25:01.480 --> 25:07.720
have fun spoil the movies for yourselves have a blast but if you go and tell all

25:07.720 --> 25:10.400
your friends about the spoilers somebody's gonna get pissed off at you

25:10.400 --> 25:13.520
about it I think it's kind of similar you can ruin the game for yourself if

25:13.520 --> 25:16.520
you want, but ruining the game for others is crossing the line. That's kind of the way

25:16.520 --> 25:18.720
I look at it.

25:18.720 --> 25:21.520
It's just like, and you know what's funny is it kind of makes me think about last night

25:21.520 --> 25:26.760
playing Halo 2, or watching my buddies play Halo 2, somebody actually cheated a game.

25:26.760 --> 25:31.460
They used a technique in Halo 2 called the lag, where basically, my friend was trying

25:31.460 --> 25:37.100
to explain this, and I don't follow Halo 2 cheating at all, but apparently these guys

25:37.100 --> 25:43.500
were hooking up the Xbox to their computer somehow so that they would always be the server,

25:43.500 --> 25:47.360
And if they're the server, they can cause the other players to lag out and basically

25:47.360 --> 25:49.180
kill them while they can't move.

25:49.180 --> 25:53.320
And I was watching this happening, sure enough, every couple minutes, lag, lag, lag, my friends

25:53.320 --> 25:54.320
are dead.

25:54.320 --> 25:55.320
Lag, lag, lag, my friends are dead.

25:55.320 --> 25:58.240
And everybody was bitching and complaining about this, so somebody was doing this and

25:58.240 --> 26:00.720
the person had way many kills.

26:00.720 --> 26:08.680
So you know, I mean, not only is that unethical in my opinion, but it's, get a life, seriously,

26:08.680 --> 26:13.000
what do you have to gain from kicking some people's butts on Halo 2?

26:13.000 --> 26:16.680
On a Saturday night nonetheless, go out and get laid.

26:16.680 --> 26:22.680
Seriously, I realize we do an internet radio show where we talk about video games, but

26:22.680 --> 26:25.800
we try to talk about balance between that and having a personal life.

26:25.800 --> 26:30.400
So please kids, stop cheating on Halo 2 to make your internet penis feel bigger.

26:30.400 --> 26:35.000
Go out and get laid, because I'll tell you what, an orgasm feels 10,000 times better

26:35.000 --> 26:39.300
than owning some noob in Halo 2, at least in my opinion.

26:39.300 --> 26:46.500
you feel differently? I don't know. Follow up to a previous story we talked about. You

26:46.500 --> 26:50.340
know how we said that the firmware was going to be upgraded on the Sony PSP like two weeks

26:50.340 --> 26:56.000
ago? Well they were a little bit late, finally came out, it was finally released, came out

26:56.000 --> 27:00.420
this past week, and now it's available on Sony's site. So if you are interested in upgrading

27:00.420 --> 27:05.080
your firmware to 2.0, you can go ahead and do that. What you're going to get, a new web

27:05.080 --> 27:10.040
browser application. And it also has like a tabbing feature. You can have three tabs

27:10.040 --> 27:15.400
of browser windows open at once, which is kind of neat. Other additions include four-three

27:15.400 --> 27:21.440
ratio, so you can watch like TV programs, four-three screen mode. AAC and WAV audio

27:21.440 --> 27:26.520
files are also added. Check out the PlayStation site if you want more details. I got to check

27:26.520 --> 27:30.000
out, because I checked out on Loki's new PSP. He upgraded it to 2.0. I checked out the web

27:30.000 --> 27:34.800
browser, and of course I'm loading OrangeLoungeRadio.com on the web browser, looking at it, and ooh,

27:34.800 --> 27:37.800
Neat, I guess, neat.

27:37.800 --> 27:40.800
It's a lot faster than the Wipeout browser, I'll give them that.

27:40.800 --> 27:43.800
That's for sure, it's a lot faster than that.

27:43.800 --> 27:50.800
And browsing is pretty easy. I don't like the stupid little text input that they have, but they're releasing a keyboard for it.

27:50.800 --> 27:52.800
Where it's like a cell phone, like where you have to keep tapping.

27:52.800 --> 27:56.800
Yeah, they're going to be releasing a keyboard, so, you know, whatever.

27:56.800 --> 27:59.800
But they actually did improve, you know, their method of entering stuff in,

27:59.800 --> 28:06.800
because you can see how many times you've got to tab the button to get to your next letter, but it's not that hard.

28:06.800 --> 28:12.800
I mean, it's not going to be good for chatting or anything, but even some of the IRC programs that they've made for it,

28:12.800 --> 28:19.800
like the one website, PSP IRC or something like that, they have a Java keyboard anyway, so you don't really need it.

28:19.800 --> 28:23.640
needed. But they're gonna be adding, they said

28:23.640 --> 28:28.080
that they're gonna be looking at Java or to expand the Java a bit

28:28.080 --> 28:31.720
and to add Flash. Now that would be interesting because that would mean

28:31.720 --> 28:32.840
you could download games

28:32.840 --> 28:35.960
essentially to your PSP very easily, right? I don't know about...

28:35.960 --> 28:39.440
Well, they're gonna have downloading games. In fact, there's a

28:39.440 --> 28:44.960
campaign being launched in the UK for their PSP launch. It's called YourPSP.com

28:44.960 --> 28:49.380
and they're gonna have movie trailers, downloadable games, and stuff like that

28:49.380 --> 28:51.420
And so, I'll be interested when that happens.

28:51.420 --> 28:54.140
And you could, essentially, if they're going to implement Flash,

28:54.140 --> 28:57.220
then you would be able to download Strong Bad, right?

28:57.220 --> 28:59.580
You could listen to that on your PSP, right?

28:59.580 --> 29:02.500
Yeah, I guess you could.

29:02.500 --> 29:06.820
So, do we really need Strong Bad to burninate your PSP?

29:06.820 --> 29:10.740
Well, you know, a lot of the kids out there would like that, so...

29:10.740 --> 29:13.540
I like Strong Bad, he's funny.

29:13.540 --> 29:15.140
Moving on, what do you got for us tonight, Loki?

29:15.140 --> 29:18.620
Well, we've got a couple things, a couple things in the rumor mills.

29:18.620 --> 29:24.580
First off, starting at IGN did this nice little look at the Game Boy Micro, which is coming

29:24.580 --> 29:27.260
out in September here in a couple weeks.

29:27.260 --> 29:31.980
They did a bunch of size comparisons, and I can say that it's about the size of a stick

29:31.980 --> 29:36.540
of gum, because they have a winter fresh gum thing next to it.

29:36.540 --> 29:37.540
Honestly...

29:37.540 --> 29:40.120
Looks more like the size of the guy's cell phone in the picture you have there.

29:40.120 --> 29:41.380
It's just a small Game Boy Advance.

29:41.380 --> 29:45.540
I mean, if you really want to buy it again, go for it, but I don't know.

29:45.540 --> 29:48.100
I don't see the point of buying this thing.

29:48.100 --> 29:52.700
Some people out there might like the accessory-ness of this.

29:52.700 --> 29:53.700
I don't know.

29:53.700 --> 29:56.860
Well, the people that buy this thing and like the fact that you can change the faceplates

29:56.860 --> 30:00.380
are the people that buy the stupid Game Boy Advances when they come out in different colors.

30:00.380 --> 30:01.540
Do we really?

30:01.540 --> 30:02.540
I mean, no.

30:02.540 --> 30:05.700
I mean, no, I'm not buying that.

30:05.700 --> 30:12.100
Anyways, the other thing was is they had some info on what they think is going to be revolutionary

30:12.100 --> 30:15.140
about the Nintendo Revolution.

30:15.140 --> 30:21.960
Now granted we're gonna know in a few weeks. What is revolutionary about it because on the 16th Nintendo's actually holding a press conference

30:21.960 --> 30:24.380
They're gonna let all the cats out of the bag about time

30:24.620 --> 30:30.640
So everything's gonna be known about the revolution, but in the meantime we could speculate to you know

30:30.640 --> 30:34.840
The cows all right speculate away. Oh this speculation is supposedly by this guy

30:36.120 --> 30:38.680
sponge or whatever he claims to

30:39.400 --> 30:43.100
Know what's going on? And basically he's said that there's gonna be

30:43.100 --> 30:48.680
be it's gonna make it so where that it's hard to turn the controller like tilt

30:48.680 --> 30:51.360
the controller it's gonna have gyroscopes in it so it's gonna be like

30:51.360 --> 30:55.000
kind of like an almost like the rumble pack but it's gonna make it so that it

30:55.000 --> 30:57.920
feels like for example you're drifting around the corner it'll give you g

30:57.920 --> 31:01.720
forces you know going to one direction or something I don't know how that's

31:01.720 --> 31:04.820
gonna work but that's an interesting idea because it'll be revolutionary in

31:04.820 --> 31:08.840
fact that this is a mid-dunt and the fact that gyroscopes spin revolutionary

31:08.840 --> 31:12.160
Ah, cute. Cute.

31:12.160 --> 31:16.360
That's a theory, but I don't know. My personal thing is I think it's gonna be

31:16.360 --> 31:16.840
that

31:16.840 --> 31:20.080
and I think if you've seen those keywords out there that have little LCD

31:20.080 --> 31:21.000
buttons on them

31:21.000 --> 31:24.840
where they can change what the button looks like, I think that's gonna be a

31:24.840 --> 31:25.520
thing.

31:25.520 --> 31:28.880
I think it's two things, but I don't know.

31:28.880 --> 31:32.360
I'm totally speculating too, but we'll know in a couple weeks on the 16th.

31:32.360 --> 31:35.680
All the speculation comes back to the controller, which I think is interesting.

31:35.680 --> 31:40.680
Yeah, and they said that that would be revolutionary, I'd imagine, but I don't know if it's revolutionary

31:40.680 --> 31:41.680
enough to sell the system.

31:41.680 --> 31:42.680
You know what, though?

31:42.680 --> 31:46.440
You're also assuming, though, when you're saying that it's a play on the name, that

31:46.440 --> 31:48.600
the actual name of the system is going to be the revolution.

31:48.600 --> 31:50.560
This is still a working title, correct?

31:50.560 --> 31:54.100
They have not confirmed that this will be the actual name of the system.

31:54.100 --> 31:56.640
And for the longest time, GameCube was what, Dolphin?

31:56.640 --> 31:57.640
I think they were calling it?

31:57.640 --> 31:58.640
Yeah.

31:58.640 --> 31:59.640
Or was that the 64?

31:59.640 --> 32:00.640
I don't know.

32:00.640 --> 32:01.640
One or the other.

32:01.640 --> 32:02.640
One of them, yeah.

32:02.640 --> 32:03.640
And they changed the name before it was released.

32:03.640 --> 32:05.440
So this may not actually be the Nintendo revolution.

32:05.440 --> 32:07.760
we may get a new name coming up.

32:07.760 --> 32:11.040
Yeah, just like the Xbox 360, what the hell was that?

32:11.040 --> 32:14.680
I mean, 360, that's retarded.

32:14.680 --> 32:18.880
Xbox 2, Xbox 360, why is it the 360?

32:18.880 --> 32:22.160
Well, yeah, because we're going back around

32:22.160 --> 32:24.640
and doing the same thing all over again, I don't know.

32:25.840 --> 32:27.160
So anyways, there's that.

32:27.160 --> 32:29.840
And speaking of the 360, and I mentioned this

32:29.840 --> 32:33.720
a couple weeks ago about the Origin 360 site,

32:33.720 --> 32:39.720
Well, it's changing. The site is changing, and there's more stuff happening.

32:39.720 --> 32:49.720
Before, for those who might not remember, the Origin site had a picture of a tree with a countdown to sometime in September, and there was a bunny rabbit.

32:49.720 --> 32:54.720
Bunny rabbits moved to the other side of the screen, the hole's getting bigger in the bottom of the tree, and there's apples growing.

32:54.720 --> 33:02.220
And one of the apples is a symbol for the Windows Messenger.

33:02.220 --> 33:04.080
Which is interesting.

33:04.080 --> 33:07.820
So integration with Windows messaging for Xbox 360?

33:07.820 --> 33:08.820
Maybe?

33:08.820 --> 33:09.820
Sure!

33:09.820 --> 33:10.820
I mean, come on!

33:10.820 --> 33:11.820
This is a Windows product, or a Microsoft product.

33:11.820 --> 33:14.280
Of course they're going to have that.

33:14.280 --> 33:16.660
Don't jump to conclusions, I mean, you never know.

33:16.660 --> 33:21.460
It's just another viral site, if you really want to check it out, originxbox360.com, that's

33:21.460 --> 33:24.900
That's O-R-I-G-E-N Xbox 360 dot com.

33:24.900 --> 33:26.380
Go look at the pretty bunny.

33:26.380 --> 33:32.340
And um, yeah, so I guess, you know, something's gonna happen with a bunny.

33:32.340 --> 33:33.880
The controller will be a bunny, no?

33:33.880 --> 33:35.580
I think the bunny should be a mascot.

33:35.580 --> 33:37.280
We need a good bunny mascot.

33:37.280 --> 33:39.660
It's a cardboard bunny, it doesn't do anything.

33:39.660 --> 33:41.540
Fine, anything else?

33:41.540 --> 33:44.900
I think it would have been funny though, if you keep going back to the site, there's more

33:44.900 --> 33:49.180
bunnies appear or something like that, that'd be great.

33:49.180 --> 33:51.180
No, really other than that

33:51.460 --> 33:55.380
Well, I've got more hack and crack stuff, but we'll get into that later a little later. All right

33:55.380 --> 33:57.380
Yeah, we'll do some more stories over here

33:57.660 --> 34:01.900
Tamagotchi is coming out for the DS which shouldn't be much of a surprise when you consider that the Nintendo, you know

34:01.900 --> 34:07.740
Nintendogs was kind of a you know could you could say inspired by Tamagotchi, but this is the weird thing

34:07.820 --> 34:12.760
The Tamagotchi isn't game is not what you think. It's not like the old keychain game

34:13.380 --> 34:17.020
It's gonna be released this winter bound I but of course in Japan

34:17.020 --> 34:23.060
Tamagotchi Corner Shop, a simulation game set in the world of Tamagotchi and what you're

34:23.060 --> 34:27.280
going to do is you're going to open up your own business and make it the best in the land.

34:27.280 --> 34:34.060
You help Maimchi, Memi-chi, or Kupachi set up a shop and the ultimate goal is to become

34:34.060 --> 34:36.100
Princess Tamako's favorite one.

34:36.100 --> 34:37.100
Whatever.

34:37.100 --> 34:38.100
Huh?

34:38.100 --> 34:39.100
Yeah, whatever.

34:39.100 --> 34:40.960
That's exactly what I said about this.

34:40.960 --> 34:45.660
You can do a beauty salon or a flower shop and you do mini games with a DS stylus.

34:45.660 --> 34:46.660
Huh?

34:46.660 --> 34:49.020
yeah anyway

34:49.020 --> 34:51.940
file that so it's uh...

34:51.940 --> 34:56.420
harvest moon but with convenience stores with uh... characters that were pop

34:56.420 --> 34:58.460
culture ten years ago

34:58.460 --> 34:59.220
you know

34:59.220 --> 35:01.420
what speaking of uh...

35:01.420 --> 35:02.780
so what are she uh...

35:02.780 --> 35:06.420
mew pet starkest fairy comes out next month

35:06.420 --> 35:07.260
who

35:07.260 --> 35:10.060
the

35:10.060 --> 35:14.980
and nintendo is buying back two point two million shares the possible reason

35:14.980 --> 35:19.380
for this possible reason for this Square Enix trying to take over Taito. Nintendo

35:19.380 --> 35:22.300
does not want to be taken over at this point. You know what I was thinking this

35:22.300 --> 35:26.500
week in a completely random subject this is completely out of left field you know

35:26.500 --> 35:32.040
I was thinking this week Apple and Nintendo should team up seriously Apple

35:32.040 --> 35:36.580
and Nintendo should team up Apple is good at making cute stuff cute computers

35:36.580 --> 35:40.500
cute systems and granted their systems do a lot of great stuff Loki I know you

35:40.500 --> 35:44.580
disagree with this but I think that you know max they do their thing they're

35:44.580 --> 35:48.420
just different it's another choice Nintendo is kind of different and cute

35:48.420 --> 35:51.180
and does their own thing I think there's a partnership to be had here between

35:51.180 --> 35:55.380
Apple and Nintendo I don't know I was just randomly thinking that the other day

35:55.380 --> 36:01.260
you know I think what what the hell there's like a sticker on here on your

36:01.260 --> 36:06.580
DS yeah came with scratching of the stylus anyways I was thinking and just

36:06.580 --> 36:11.660
when you mentioned the Apple and Nintendo I was just thinking the apples

36:11.660 --> 36:17.660
are like the Volkswagen of the PC world. That's what they reminded me of.

36:17.660 --> 36:20.660
You can address those cards and letters to Loki at orange-longstreet.com.

36:20.660 --> 36:25.660
I mean, look, they release cute stuff that's in different colors. I mean, that's what Volkswagen does.

36:25.660 --> 36:28.660
Cute cars suck, but...

36:28.660 --> 36:32.660
Yeah, so by the way, in case you missed that underlying story within the story,

36:32.660 --> 36:36.660
Square Enix made a $600 million bid for Taito this week, so...

36:36.660 --> 36:40.660
And what did we try to do? We tried to figure out, what would it sound like if we combined all three...

36:40.660 --> 36:42.660
Square Enix and Taito?

36:42.660 --> 36:43.660
Squeedo.

36:43.660 --> 36:44.660
Squeedo!

36:44.660 --> 36:45.660
Squeedo.

36:45.660 --> 36:46.660
I like Squeedo.

36:46.660 --> 36:47.660
I like Squeedo too.

36:47.660 --> 36:50.660
So the company will hereforth be known as Squeedo.

36:50.660 --> 36:53.660
Assuming this goes through, which I don't see why it won't at this point.

36:53.660 --> 36:54.660
I mean, who cares?

36:54.660 --> 36:55.660
So what?

36:55.660 --> 36:56.660
It's, you know...

36:56.660 --> 36:58.660
I think it's a good thing.

36:58.660 --> 37:00.660
Yeah, why not?

37:00.660 --> 37:01.660
Metroid Prime.

37:01.660 --> 37:02.660
You know how there was this big stink?

37:02.660 --> 37:05.660
We even talked about this on the show a couple months ago, where folks were saying that,

37:05.660 --> 37:07.660
oh, this game should have been online.

37:07.660 --> 37:09.660
If you keep pushing this game back, it should have been online.

37:09.660 --> 37:13.340
Why didn't you put this game online you keep pushing this back and Nintendo finally saying?

37:15.460 --> 37:17.460
Metroid Prime going online

37:18.220 --> 37:21.700
Prime hunters. Yes, Metroid Prime hunters. I'm sorry Metroid hunters will be going online

37:22.900 --> 37:26.360
It will be compatible with the Nintendo's Wi-Fi service coming out later this year

37:27.460 --> 37:29.460
Which got pushed back pride in November?

37:29.980 --> 37:31.980
everything else

37:32.220 --> 37:35.940
Can't intend to do any okay any game company do anything on time? I?

37:35.940 --> 37:39.980
I wanted my Mario Kart god damn it for my birthday

37:39.980 --> 37:43.020
and I had to wait until November that's not fair

37:43.020 --> 37:48.220
that Animal Crossing sorry speaking of the DS Sony's flinging a little mud

37:48.220 --> 37:49.420
calling the DS

37:49.420 --> 37:52.460
a gimmick this week Sony

37:52.460 --> 37:55.500
releasing some commentary this week

37:55.500 --> 38:00.140
vice president of the Sony Studios Phil Harrison making the following comments

38:00.140 --> 38:04.100
on the idea of a handheld right over you with Nintendo is an irrelevance

38:04.100 --> 38:08.100
Those formats don't appear in our planning. It's not a fair comparison. Not fair on them, I should stress.

38:08.100 --> 38:11.100
That sounds arrogant, maybe, but that's the truth.

38:11.100 --> 38:15.100
We're just bitter that they're outselling this to Japan! By a lot!

38:15.100 --> 38:17.100
But, here's the interesting quote here now.

38:17.100 --> 38:22.100
But I fear that it won't have a lasting impact beyond that of a gimmick.

38:22.100 --> 38:27.100
So the long-lasting appeal of the platform is at peril as a direct result of that.

38:27.100 --> 38:31.100
Yeah, do you think that the DS is going to be the last handheld system? No.

38:31.100 --> 38:35.380
Here's another one. Nintendo knows its target audience because it has really

38:35.380 --> 38:38.860
narrowed that down and it's pretty much defined by a boy or girl's ability to

38:38.860 --> 38:39.940
admire Pokemon.

38:39.940 --> 38:46.380
Ooh, burn! Yeah, and what's the PSP had released for now?

38:46.380 --> 38:50.100
Oh, rehashes of crappy games that were out on the PlayStation.

38:50.100 --> 38:54.820
Yeah, I, you know, I like the PSP and I don't want to take sides in the PSP

38:54.820 --> 38:57.780
versus DS War because the PSP does have a lot of great features,

38:57.780 --> 39:01.460
especially in the fact that it's a multimedia system. However, in games,

39:01.460 --> 39:05.780
PSP's lacking a little bit right now. Realize there's good stuff on the horizon

39:05.780 --> 39:07.420
like Grand Theft Auto, but you know,

39:07.420 --> 39:11.820
as far as I'm concerned, don't start making these comments till you get the games to back it up.

39:11.820 --> 39:15.540
Because Luminous is just one game. Seriously, I have both.

39:15.540 --> 39:20.180
And you know what? I'm looking at the lineup of games coming out for the PSP.

39:20.180 --> 39:24.820
Ain't nothing impressive. But earlier, you know, I bet if we went back to

39:24.820 --> 39:27.900
to archives of the show from february you would hear me saying the same crap

39:27.900 --> 39:32.620
about the DS right before the PSP came out where DS needs to put out some games

39:32.620 --> 39:38.020
show the system but they've done that now! Meteos, Nintendogs, the Prime

39:38.020 --> 39:39.820
DS has a ton of stuff coming out

39:39.820 --> 39:41.020
a ton of stuff

39:41.020 --> 39:42.780
just being released PSP

39:42.780 --> 39:44.460
one or two a month

39:44.460 --> 39:46.140
with UMDs galore

39:46.140 --> 39:47.660
but yeah tons of movies

39:47.660 --> 39:52.180
good good for movies but uh... you know what it's a gaming system

39:52.180 --> 39:55.740
it's a gaming system, not an internet browser, not a movie player

39:55.740 --> 39:59.660
it's a gaming system. Well now here's something that the PSP can do that the

39:59.660 --> 40:02.460
Nintendo can't do to try and curb some of those hate mails we're going to get

40:02.460 --> 40:04.140
from Sony fans because there is

40:04.140 --> 40:07.460
this feature that the PSP is going to do that the Nintendo DS cannot do

40:07.460 --> 40:11.380
and that's custom soundtracks. Now of course you know this feature from the Xbox

40:11.380 --> 40:14.540
but when the PSP launches in Europe this week, which by the way

40:14.540 --> 40:18.020
PSP is launching in Europe this week, one of the games that's going to be released

40:18.020 --> 40:20.320
for it is going to let you have a custom soundtrack and it's

40:20.320 --> 40:24.160
Tokka Race Driver 2. You can have a custom soundtrack option

40:24.160 --> 40:26.940
and if you have music stored on your memory stick you can use that as the

40:26.940 --> 40:28.120
music you listen to in-game.

40:28.120 --> 40:31.160
It's pretty cool. That's a cool idea. Now there you go.

40:31.160 --> 40:36.000
Now to use the feature, by the way, you have to download the free

40:36.000 --> 40:39.580
exact audio copy utility from Codemasters

40:39.580 --> 40:43.760
UK website. That's codemasters.co.uk

40:43.760 --> 40:49.640
So check that out. North American release not announced yet but

40:49.640 --> 40:52.640
Codemasters does bring a lot of their Europe games over here.

40:52.640 --> 40:53.640
Toca is one.

40:53.640 --> 40:56.640
I'm sure it will be here in a minute.

40:56.640 --> 40:57.640
What else you got for us tonight, Loki?

40:57.640 --> 41:04.640
Well, speaking of the PSP, lots of stuff when it comes to doing things on the PSP that you're not supposed to.

41:04.640 --> 41:09.640
Number one would be they found a way, or I should say it's going to be released next week,

41:09.640 --> 41:18.640
they found a way to turn back the clock or to bring the PSP from version 1.52 or 1.51

41:18.640 --> 41:23.120
back to 1.5. So like a DD level

41:23.120 --> 41:26.480
your PSP, for lack of a better term. Basically you can

41:26.480 --> 41:30.440
take your PSP and turn it back to 1.5

41:30.440 --> 41:34.000
only if you haven't upgraded to 2.0 because stuff gets a little

41:34.000 --> 41:37.920
different when you get to 2.0. However though the other thing you can do though

41:37.920 --> 41:38.680
with it

41:38.680 --> 41:42.240
they released another program this week to basically spoof

41:42.240 --> 41:46.080
what version your PSP is so for those games that want you to upgrade to 2.0

41:46.080 --> 41:50.040
or to you know 1.5 or whatever you can make it look like that your PSP is a

41:50.040 --> 41:50.960
1.5 or

41:50.960 --> 41:55.240
2.0 or whatever. So it's kinda interesting.

41:55.240 --> 42:00.820
Then other than that there's some major development in this new

42:00.820 --> 42:04.580
GUI that this guy's coming out with called P6 which

42:04.580 --> 42:09.200
looks amazing. It's got actually, they've done everything from being able to play

42:09.200 --> 42:10.600
videos. It looks just like Windows

42:10.600 --> 42:14.560
sort of. You can play audio files and that type of stuff. Homebrew.

42:14.560 --> 42:17.760
Wait, so this is a... It's like a shell.

42:17.760 --> 42:22.920
Okay, for PSP? For PSP. It alters the way things look and feel.

42:22.920 --> 42:26.560
Yeah. Okay. What's also cool about it though, they've added a ton of other stuff like, for

42:26.560 --> 42:27.280
example,

42:27.280 --> 42:30.400
they are using a camera phone,

42:30.400 --> 42:34.680
this add-on for some Sony Ericsson camera phone

42:34.680 --> 42:37.920
to actually be able to have

42:37.920 --> 42:42.480
a webcam on it. So you can actually take pictures with your PSP,

42:42.480 --> 42:45.800
which is very interesting actually.

42:45.800 --> 42:49.680
So that's going to be coming out and I'm sure they're going to have a web browser and stuff.

42:49.680 --> 42:52.680
Tons of work being done on it.

42:52.680 --> 42:57.440
Website with more info for this? They have a PSPupdates.com has an

42:57.440 --> 42:58.760
interview actually with the guy

42:58.760 --> 43:03.040
goes by the name Fluff. They were hosting some

43:03.040 --> 43:06.320
cool like kind of a teaser

43:06.320 --> 43:09.960
videos for it too and it looks really cool from what I've seen so far.

43:09.960 --> 43:12.200
just to double check you've had on

43:12.200 --> 43:16.920
psp hack stories from a guy named sponge and a guy named fluff correct

43:16.920 --> 43:18.220
yes gauges

43:18.220 --> 43:20.080
just verifying that

43:20.080 --> 43:22.560
uh... the other thing i was going to mention this should make you a little

43:22.560 --> 43:24.520
bit excited there rob uh...

43:24.520 --> 43:29.000
stella has been ported over to the psp it's hard to a six hundred yes that's

43:29.000 --> 43:33.800
awesome and it's still there working on getting the speed up but uh...

43:33.800 --> 43:38.980
still off adventure time it's time to play some sort quest here i come nobody

43:38.980 --> 43:44.120
need to do? Stella with some like, you know, ad hoc compatibility. How about Stella with

43:44.120 --> 43:48.860
some wireless multiplayer? Second play two player combat. Yeah combat, it's on. That'd

43:48.860 --> 43:54.300
be awesome. They need to make a new combat game. Atari needs to remake combat. We need

43:54.300 --> 43:57.860
to have a petition for them to remake combat. Didn't they? I thought it was one, cause you

43:57.860 --> 44:01.920
know how they remade Pong and uh, what else? I don't think they did combat. I know they

44:01.920 --> 44:08.420
did Pong, I know they did Spogger. Oh Pac-Man, so I guess Namco. Alright, but all these Atari

44:08.420 --> 44:13.180
Warlords was one. Didn't they do combat?

44:13.180 --> 44:16.780
They might have done combat. Well, whatever. They should do it again.

44:16.780 --> 44:20.380
Make it better. But here's the thing is the PSP needs more games that are

44:20.380 --> 44:20.940
actually

44:20.940 --> 44:24.300
over the internet. You know, they've got like a couple so far.

44:24.300 --> 44:29.140
It took the DS a year, so give the PSP until E3 next year.

44:29.140 --> 44:32.540
I don't know. I mean, that was one of the things that they're pushing. You can play

44:32.540 --> 44:33.580
people over the internet!

44:33.580 --> 44:37.180
Not yet. We'll see.

44:37.180 --> 44:39.580
All right, is that it?

44:39.580 --> 44:40.980
That's for now, yeah.

44:40.980 --> 44:42.940
You know the only thing, though, about Stella, though,

44:42.940 --> 44:45.200
and Atari 2600 emulation, you know, in all honesty,

44:45.200 --> 44:47.860
even though I talk wonderful things about these games,

44:47.860 --> 44:49.420
Kaboom, of course, but another one of my favorites,

44:49.420 --> 44:50.740
Pitfall 2, love it.

44:51.660 --> 44:54.420
The emulation thrill usually lasts about five minutes.

44:55.420 --> 44:56.620
And then it's like, oh, isn't that cute,

44:56.620 --> 44:57.460
let's move on the road.

44:57.460 --> 44:58.300
I mean, the fact that you can download

44:58.300 --> 45:00.900
every single game ever made for the Atari,

45:00.900 --> 45:04.580
and fit it under six megs, that's, yeah.

45:04.580 --> 45:07.500
That's just technology, that's just technology.

45:07.500 --> 45:09.660
Ragnarok 2, I know we got a lot of listeners

45:09.660 --> 45:11.140
that are really into Ragnarok Online,

45:11.140 --> 45:12.500
and I'm sure if Dark Sakura were here,

45:12.500 --> 45:14.700
she'd be saying something about this.

45:14.700 --> 45:17.580
At the Ragnarok Festival, which was held in July,

45:17.580 --> 45:21.500
Gravity said that they will reveal Ragnarok 2 Online

45:21.500 --> 45:23.200
at the Tokyo Game Show.

45:23.200 --> 45:25.580
The show is taking place September 16th,

45:25.580 --> 45:27.700
so if you're a fan of Ragnarok Online,

45:27.700 --> 45:30.120
stay tuned to September and the Tokyo Game Show,

45:30.120 --> 45:31.420
because they're gonna have more information

45:31.420 --> 45:33.060
about Ragnarok 2.

45:33.060 --> 45:34.420
That's really all I've got to say about that.

45:34.420 --> 45:36.620
There was nothing else in that story.

45:36.620 --> 45:41.000
Tekken 5 is going to be re-released in the arcades

45:41.000 --> 45:44.200
as Tekken 5 Dark Resurrection,

45:44.200 --> 45:45.840
and it's gonna have two new characters

45:45.840 --> 45:48.440
as well as some newly rendered backgrounds.

45:48.440 --> 45:51.360
It's gonna be shown at the Amusement Machine Show in Japan

45:51.360 --> 45:53.960
on September 1st, and should make its way

45:53.960 --> 45:55.560
to arcades this winter.

45:56.760 --> 45:58.440
FYI, they're also gonna be showing

45:58.440 --> 46:01.280
some other interesting Namco games at this show.

46:01.280 --> 46:04.000
Druaga Online, which I think is really weird.

46:04.000 --> 46:06.840
Suddenly, Druaga is really big with Namco again.

46:06.840 --> 46:09.140
You might remember this old, old, old, old game

46:09.140 --> 46:11.440
in the arcades, Tower of Druaga, I think it is.

46:11.440 --> 46:14.360
Well, they recently released a PS2 Druaga title,

46:14.360 --> 46:17.040
and now they've got Druaga Online, so I guess they,

46:17.040 --> 46:18.760
and I didn't, maybe it was one of those things

46:18.760 --> 46:20.540
that was big in Japan, and I just missed it somehow,

46:20.540 --> 46:21.780
but I don't know.

46:21.780 --> 46:24.080
As far as I know, that series was dormant for like 20 years,

46:24.080 --> 46:26.280
but I could be wrong, don't send hate mail.

46:27.240 --> 46:31.080
Soul Calibur 3 has a date for Japan, November 24th,

46:31.080 --> 46:33.360
Which is a little bit sooner than I expected

46:34.000 --> 46:39.880
November 24th for Japan get this October 25th for America. I thought that this was a game

46:39.880 --> 46:42.620
We wouldn't be getting till next year apparently I fell asleep on this one

46:43.480 --> 46:50.120
For new characters according to Famitsu magazine that are also going to be in this game Soulcalibur 3 maxi songmina

46:50.560 --> 46:54.320
Zangwa and young sung will also be in Soulcalibur 3 hmm

46:54.320 --> 46:58.240
And that's in addition to those previously announced characters and of course make your own characters

46:58.240 --> 47:03.360
Soulcalibur 3 will also be having a battle arena mode where you can like set certain

47:03.360 --> 47:06.040
conditions for the fight to be able to win the fight.

47:06.040 --> 47:11.260
So might make for some interesting challenges, I don't know.

47:11.260 --> 47:14.980
There's also coin, I guess these are things that are built in battle arena, I'm not sure,

47:14.980 --> 47:19.280
coin collector where you have to collect as many coins as you can by attacking the opponent

47:19.280 --> 47:21.960
and the coins you get are based on the attacks that you land on the opponent.

47:21.960 --> 47:23.560
Soulcalibur party or something?

47:23.560 --> 47:25.400
I don't know.

47:25.400 --> 47:30.300
The Statue Dances is another mode where you fight against a large stone statue that's

47:30.300 --> 47:40.300
eight times the size of your character, and it attacks, because you're fast, but the statue

47:40.300 --> 47:44.000
is very slow, but it's very powerful, so you have to be quick.

47:44.000 --> 47:45.000
I guess.

47:45.000 --> 47:46.000
The Statue Dances.

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
So, everybody party!

47:48.000 --> 47:49.000
Interesting.

47:49.000 --> 47:54.640
You know, they're doing interesting things with it, I think it'll be kind of cool.

47:54.640 --> 47:59.000
Nintendo, of course with their release of Nintendogs, they have a new partnership between

47:59.000 --> 48:05.120
Dogs Trust for the American and European release of Nintendogs, just to kind of remind people

48:05.120 --> 48:11.720
that you know, raising a puppy in real life is a lot more complicated than it is in Nintendogs.

48:11.720 --> 48:16.800
You can't turn off a real puppy, so, and I noticed this in the manual of the game even,

48:16.800 --> 48:20.920
there's this big disclaimer about you know, if you want to get a real puppy, keep in mind

48:20.920 --> 48:25.200
They don't stay puppies forever something to that effect, so if you own Nintendogs check it out

48:25.200 --> 48:27.460
It's in the front of the manual an interesting little disclaimer there

48:28.420 --> 48:35.620
Dogs trust their marketing director Adrian brooder saying dogs trust is pleased to be associated with Nintendogs the philosophy

48:35.980 --> 48:41.340
Philosophy behind the game has a lot in common with our own aims of ensuring that every dog is a happy and loved pet

48:41.520 --> 48:47.220
Despite the fame of our dog is for life slogan thousands of dogs are still abandoned and unwanted every year

48:47.220 --> 48:53.260
So it's great that there's a game that's not only fun to play but supports the message that responsible dog ownership means more than giving

48:53.260 --> 48:55.260
your dog an occasional stroke

48:55.660 --> 48:57.920
He could have used better word choice there, but whatever

49:01.100 --> 49:05.220
I only think of South Park right now. I don't get ready to rock you ready to rock it

49:05.220 --> 49:12.180
Ah any more stories for us Loki, you know, I don't I just reading there's some interesting thing

49:12.180 --> 49:18.020
They're talking about online, you know poker sites and people bodying on that and winning real money. Ooh

49:19.300 --> 49:22.040
It's just a matter of time before something like that happens

49:22.740 --> 49:23.860
interesting

49:23.860 --> 49:28.500
Mmm, because when I was when I was that email I read today when I was doing some of the research

49:28.500 --> 49:32.780
I actually was reading comments on I don't slash dot or some other site where people were saying if

49:33.380 --> 49:39.220
Somebody it's just a matter of time before somebody does this in a game where it's real money at stake as opposed to

49:39.220 --> 49:42.820
to fake items worth real money in the online auction world.

49:42.820 --> 49:45.540
Yeah, I guess it's on this game called Win Hold'em.

49:45.540 --> 49:53.400
And I guess it's articles about the rise of internet botting.

49:53.400 --> 49:55.140
And they're talking about on the internet,

49:55.140 --> 49:56.260
nobody knows you're a bot.

49:56.260 --> 50:02.300
And I guess last year, poker sites raked in $1.4 billion.

50:02.300 --> 50:06.260
And I mean, just someone runs a bot,

50:06.260 --> 50:08.940
and they can win tons of money.

50:08.940 --> 50:11.440
kinda crazy

50:11.440 --> 50:13.780
interesting yeah

50:13.780 --> 50:17.320
alright I guess we're on to our last story of the night

50:17.320 --> 50:20.580
and the last story of the night has to do with male nudity in a video game

50:20.580 --> 50:25.380
oh god. I'm sure Tark's soccer warriors should be very happy right now

50:25.380 --> 50:28.420
no no don't shut off your iPod just yet no no don't turn it off

50:28.420 --> 50:31.780
there's actually more to this story here um it's actually

50:31.780 --> 50:35.820
a midway game and it's their blitz series so it's like a football series of

50:35.820 --> 50:36.300
games

50:36.300 --> 50:40.640
Yeah, Blitz the League because, you know, they can't use NFL anymore.

50:40.640 --> 50:44.020
Yeah, exactly, so they don't do this, so it's just Blitz the League.

50:44.020 --> 50:48.260
Now, what's interesting is that supposedly, you know, rumor is it's one of their viral

50:48.260 --> 50:51.980
marketers, you know, the people that, you know, pose as regular fans that are

50:51.980 --> 50:56.140
infiltrating the message board. Well, there was a post on the Midway message boards

50:56.140 --> 50:59.540
that's a screenshot from Blitz the League, and it shows

50:59.540 --> 51:03.300
a cheerleader about ready to pull her shirt off, so, you know, gonna show her boobs,

51:03.300 --> 51:04.780
which is nothing new in a video game.

51:04.780 --> 51:09.900
But what's also interesting about it is that there's a streaker running through the middle

51:09.900 --> 51:15.400
of the football game about ready to rip off his tighty-whities he's got on there.

51:15.400 --> 51:20.780
So you can see here in this screenshot posted on this website that there's the lady there

51:20.780 --> 51:26.460
about ready to rip her top off, and a male streaker about ready to take it all off.

51:26.460 --> 51:31.820
Well Blitz the League, because they basically went this way, they were like, well, we can't

51:31.820 --> 51:36.380
use the NFL licensing anymore so we're gonna make the game a couple things

51:36.380 --> 51:43.020
violent we're gonna add drug use and we're gonna you know add nudity I guess

51:43.020 --> 51:46.780
so it's a mature out of all the football games that come out this is a mature

51:46.780 --> 51:52.220
rated football game the rest are for everybody well no I'm interested

51:52.220 --> 51:55.820
because you know NFL blitz was awesome so this should be no different

51:55.820 --> 51:59.780
props to Midway for thinking creative I guess they you know those games like

51:59.780 --> 52:02.540
madden and stuff even though you know we don't talk a whole lot about sports

52:02.540 --> 52:06.020
games because honestly I really just don't play them madden was a disappointment

52:06.020 --> 52:09.580
from what I've heard from people I've been playing they're like yeah but but

52:09.580 --> 52:12.780
previous sports titles all these EA sports house they get more and more

52:12.780 --> 52:15.940
realistic and they start feeling like you're watching Monday Night Football

52:15.940 --> 52:19.860
Midways taking that one step further with the realism aspect by having the

52:19.860 --> 52:27.300
streakers so interesting final thoughts Loki tonight I'll check out that game

52:27.300 --> 52:32.540
Midway's coming in next week, so I'll have some questions for them.

52:32.540 --> 52:34.540
Alright, sounds good.

52:34.540 --> 52:37.900
My final thought is, thank you guys very much for listening, and hey, send us an email,

Yes, we got a lot of Imani remixes coming up

53:00.820 --> 53:01.660

53:01.660 --> 53:04.880
And I got a big Tomo, which is the distributor

53:04.880 --> 53:07.500
of H-Tech to make a RPG make for the PSP.

53:07.500 --> 53:08.880
That's my goal next week.

53:08.880 --> 53:09.720
Very cool.

53:09.720 --> 53:11.900
And I received a bucket load of information

53:11.900 --> 53:13.280
on Percussion Master this week,

53:13.280 --> 53:15.160
so I'm gonna be talking about that next week's show.

53:15.160 --> 53:16.000
Okay.

53:16.000 --> 53:16.820
