00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,520
Hello everybody out there who subscribe to our podcast

5
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,880
Welcome to the orange lounge radio to go edition

6
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,960
your home for chat about video games that don't suck and

7
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,700
sometimes we do have to talk about those games that do suck but only to tell you

8
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:35,480
to avoid them

9
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:39,240
my name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Skye. Not joining us tonight

10
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:43,560
is the one and only DarkSakura. As you know DarkSakura is getting married this

11
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,600
next week if you listen to previous podcasts

12
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,760
so she's taking care of some pre-planning parties

13
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:53,320
also we should probably mention that DarkSakura actually has some family

14
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,560
that's actually in the path of Hurricane Katrina right now so

15
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:02,560
We're sure that not just Dark Sakura's family, but some of our listeners are, in fact, probably in the area where

16
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:08,560
Hurricane Katrina is expected to land, so definitely our thoughts are with you guys, and we really hope for the best for you guys.

17
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,560
Joining us tonight as well, though, is the one and only Loki.

18
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,560
Yes, I'm here.

19
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,560
How you doin'?

20
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,560
I'm...awake.

21
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,560
Yes?

22
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,560
I think.

23
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,560
Busy week?

24
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,560
Uh, no, but this week will be.

25
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,560
What do you got goin' on this next week?

26
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,560
I've got 19 game publishers coming to my work this week.

27
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,000
19 game publishers now for those folks that don't know what Loki does he does

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
he does freely talk about his work on here and you even have co-workers to

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,320
listen to this show huh yeah and they don't care that you talk about this

30
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:40,160
stuff no oh cool well then tell them what you do I'm I work for a video

31
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:46,120
distribution company called VPD second largest in the United States and I'm one

32
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:51,680
of the game sales reps there so you know basically we've got these game holders

33
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,320
coming in to check out what the company is about because they've you know they're

34
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,520
They're not familiar with VPD, they just know the old company that we bought out, which

35
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:03,960
was VBC, Video by Cyclings, so they're going to come check out the place.

36
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:08,720
On Tuesday they're having a party for them, they're going to be bringing in foosball tables,

37
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,360
pool tables, barbecue, you know, that kind of stuff.

38
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,880
And then on Wednesday we get a whole presentation by all of them, like what games are coming

39
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,140
out in the fourth quarter, and all that fun stuff.

40
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,920
So next week's show should be a really good one.

41
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,920
Should be fun, yeah.

42
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:23,920
You're gonna be in on all this.

43
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,780
Monday I'm looking forward to because Activision's coming out because they can't make it for

44
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:27,780
the other stuff.

45
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:31,280
So they're coming out on Monday to show us like, Gun and stuff like that, which, Gun

46
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,680
is going to be next to Grand Theft Auto basically, but in the old west.

47
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,680
What's Gun?

48
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,680
I haven't heard, I have not heard of that.

49
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:41,600
Gun is pretty much, it's an open kind of action game, very similar to Grand Theft Auto where

50
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:45,200
it's very, you can do whatever you want pretty much, and they have a main story that goes

51
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,360
along with that, but it's set in the wild west.

52
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,920
So you can go mine gold, you can go, you know, scalp people, you can just do all that sort

53
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,880
So it's like Deadwood, that show on HBO, kind of?

54
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,820
It's like Red Dead Revolver, but...

55
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:02,560
It's set in the Wild West, but they all say, you know, cocksucker and stuff in the words

56
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,960
that they didn't say in the Wild West?

57
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,960
I don't know, I don't know.

58
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,160
Not quite, but it's gonna be good.

59
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,160
M-rated, definitely.

60
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,160
Definitely.

61
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,160
We'll see.

62
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,160
All right, so next week should be a good show.

63
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:16,400
But you know, it's kind of cool that we have you as a part of this program, because, you

64
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,780
know, we told you guys like a month ago about Final Fantasy Advent Children getting delayed,

65
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:25,300
And suddenly this week everybody else is like, oh by the way, Final Fantasy Advent Children

66
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,300
is getting delayed.

67
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,300
Yeah, no shit.

68
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,300
I wonder where they got that rumor from.

69
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,500
Oh, that might be me.

70
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,500
That's right.

71
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:34,180
They're all, yeah, we read it on that site, Advent Children, yeah, because I, or Advent

72
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,180
Children dot net.

73
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:40,520
Yeah, because I posted it on there, you dumbass, but no, everybody still doesn't believe that's

74
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,520
coming out that day.

75
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:47,140
I'm hearing, I can't remember who the hell I heard this from, I want to say it might

76
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:54,620
even been you, um, but about why Advent Children's being delayed? I... The rumor? Okay, rumor

77
00:03:54,620 --> 00:04:00,140
of a rumor, guys. Take this with a grain of salt. I... It's one of those, like, friend

78
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:06,780
friend things. Yeah. That a possible reason why Square's delaying this is that there might...

79
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,260
You know how they're doing a theatrical release in Japan? Well, it's actually, yeah, well,

80
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:12,660
Sony. Yeah, Sony is one. Okay, whatever. Anyway. You know how they're doing a theatrical release

81
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:17,740
in Japan right? They want to do that here in the US from what I understand even though

82
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:21,500
the last Final Fantasy movie didn't do so hot, but the only way they'll do it, limited

83
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:27,600
IMAX engagement. So, take it with a grain of salt guys, but just imagine the possibilities

84
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,420
and if that's true that it is, I mean, if we're talking limited IMAX engagement, we're

85
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:36,020
talking very similar to what's going on in Tokyo, not Tokyo, Japan, in cities like Tokyo,

86
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:39,980
where they are going to be showing it in only like three or four cities for like a week.

87
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:44,820
That would probably be what happens here, but take it with a grain of salt guys, I don't

88
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:45,820
know.

89
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:46,820
I don't know.

90
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:51,240
Well, either way, it's coming out on November 29th, which is Tuesday, or right before the

91
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,380
holiday month there.

92
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:59,660
I don't know, I wish it were coming out sooner, but that's the way they told me.

93
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:01,780
I'm like, ugh, no, why?

94
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:05,820
Most of the big gaming sites are agreeing with you now, so I was reading them this week.

95
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:09,100
Well, yeah, I mean, it's been pushed back a few times, so everyone's like, well, the

96
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:13,300
Square Enix site still saying it's coming out so don't worry yeah well that's because

97
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:18,860
they have nothing to do with the date that it comes out in so whatever but yeah so that's

98
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:19,860
what's going on.

99
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,020
All right, all right.

100
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:25,340
So well let's start off tonight's show by talking about even though we've kind of already

101
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:28,740
been talking about some games we typically try to get this out in the beginning what

102
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:32,380
games have we been playing this week so Loki what have you been up to this week?

103
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:38,220
Well I've been playing a couple things Burnout 3 still of course.

104
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:44,000
I'm almost done with it because we decided to cheat and unlock everything, so, cause

105
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,840
we got, you know, we got tired of playing the same track over, no, we're still playing

106
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:52,720
it though, cause we now have really fast cars and it's still even more fun to race, but,

107
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:59,320
um, I was also playing a little bit of, um, pack picks, I tried that, how was that, I

108
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,380
saw that you picked that up, how was that game?

109
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:07,840
It was one of those like, random buys I did, and it's okay, I'm just not really kind of

110
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:13,000
Feeling the game, you know, it's kind of like it was one of those things where I played the tech demo at e3

111
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,480
you know like a couple of what was a year and a half ago when the DS was first being shown and I

112
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:21,960
Then I heard that they were making it into a game and I was kind of like you're gonna take this concept and make it

113
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,340
An actual game. I mean it see this being a minigame

114
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:32,240
But from what I understand it came out. Okay, like the best of that concept could but it's it's still it's okay

115
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:34,380
but it's just like kind of and

116
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:40,580
And it's like one of those things like oh, but maybe it should be a mini game to something or maybe it should be like

117
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,300
I don't know

118
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,980
Something built into some other game

119
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:48,660
They should put some of these DS games together like that and Yoshi touch-and-go which was very gimmicky to me too

120
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:55,540
I mean another day. Well every single pac-man game that comes out is oh, no pac-man's been turned into something else

121
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:59,080
I mean, it's like, you know, cuz pac-man's just not good enough, you know

122
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:02,720
So they got to turn him into a ball. I got to turn him into a doodle. They got to turn him into

123
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:09,680
into something else. It's just, that's what it is. It's really retarded, but it's okay.

124
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,680
I mean, it's probably not worth 30 bucks. I paid for it, but it's still okay.

125
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,420
Wait for the bargain bin. Definitely. For a lot of the DS games, wait for the bargain

126
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:22,960
bin. 35 is a lot. Well, I don't know. I disagree with you. I think Meteos is definitely worth

127
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:28,680
the price. Nintendogs, which I'm sure you're about to get to in a minute, is, depending

128
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:33,980
on if it's your kind of game because you already know if you'd like Nintendo or not honestly

129
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:38,280
you already know we don't have to tell you if it's a good or bad game you would know

130
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:42,400
if you like these virtual pet kind of games so sorry to steal your thunder but I'm sure

131
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:47,120
you've been playing a lot of Nintendo as well I've been playing a little bit and 10 dogs

132
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,600
a little bit yeah I bought all three which why did you buy all three when you can unlock

133
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:58,440
all the dogs in one cartridge if you just network well enough I don't know I didn't

134
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:05,440
know that, so I just bought all three. Sucker. You know, whatever, it's okay. Alright. Anything

135
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:10,660
else you been playing this week? Burnout, Nintendogs? What'd you think of Nintendogs?

136
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:14,800
Was it everything you'd hoped for? Yeah, but the thing's like kinda needy. It's just, you

137
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:21,600
know, I just, I don't know, I don't have enough time to play this game and other games at

138
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:27,400
the same time, so it's, that's kinda tough. Yet you would log into Final Fantasy XI for

139
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,980
hours on end. That wasn't a problem. Yeah, I played a little bit of Final Fantasy

140
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:36,140
11 this week, okay. I logged in for a couple hours, because I hadn't played for two months,

141
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:42,580
so I felt obligated. Alright. That's it. That's all I had. That's all the games you've been

142
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,180
playing? That's all I've been playing next week should

143
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:48,380
be better. Oh, I played Marvel Nemesis Rise of the Imperfects. That was the other one.

144
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:52,420
It's an awesome fighting game that they're going to be coming out with in September here,

145
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:55,660
and it's just, I don't know, it's really neat. They've got all the characters, plus they

146
00:08:55,660 --> 00:09:01,620
have these ones that EA actually made up, so that was kind of neat.

147
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:05,660
Games I've been playing this week, Nintendogs of course, I ran out and picked that one up.

148
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:09,500
I picked up the one that had the Shih Tzu in it because as I promised everybody out there

149
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:13,180
I was going to get a Shih Tzu, and I did have a Shih Tzu for a little while, but unfortunately

150
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:18,740
because I kind of felt I was screwing things up in the way I was training it by making

151
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:23,780
the voice commands a little too similar to each other, I had to delete my Shih Tzu.

152
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:28,640
So now I have a new dog, a wiener dog named Oscar, so he's cool.

153
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,980
And Loki's right, they do get pretty needy, I notice you have to kind of feed or give

154
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:35,180
it water like twice a day.

155
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:41,220
Now Nintendogs was the game that I said was the best thing I saw at E3, and did it translate

156
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:44,360
well into a full game, the five minute demo that they had at E3?

157
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:51,980
I think in most ways yes it did, certainly in the very Nintendo way, the cuteness factor,

158
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:56,140
the collectability aspect of it that's very, you know, Pokemon-ish and Animal Crossing-ish

159
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:59,220
and other Nintendo games that they're famous for.

160
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:04,780
I think it really does deliver on all that, and I really think it's a neat way to kind

161
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:10,140
of transform the Tamagotchi and Pokemon concept into something that will be very accessible

162
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,140
to a lot of people.

163
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:13,980
I think it is going to be a very successful game.

164
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:19,940
My only beef with it is that the actual game elements of it, outside of training your dog,

165
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,660
turn out to be kind of thin.

166
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:26,600
Granted you have these trial competitions that you can do, the agility trial where you

167
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:31,460
teach your dog how to jump over hurdles and run through tubes and stuff.

168
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:35,000
There's the obedience competition which is kind of boring, you just yell voice commands

169
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
at your dog.

170
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,960
A frisbee competition, I don't remember the exact name of it, but there's a frisbee competition

171
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,960
as well.

172
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:44,740
Sort of wears a little bit thin, especially the fact that you have to sit through these

173
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:50,120
two announcers who talk very slowly and have really lame jokes and stuff.

174
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:53,480
I was also a little bit disappointed that you couldn't do more with the head-to-head

175
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:57,960
aspect like you couldn't go head-to-head in an agility trial at least if you can I haven't

176
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:02,040
found this out yet or anything so I was a little disappointed that all you can really

177
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:05,980
do is exchange and play with each other's dogs although that is a really neat concept

178
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:10,240
I would have liked to see something maybe a little more competitive you can like I guess

179
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:15,200
because each game has like the certain items that are in each one right so in order to

180
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,800
get all the items you have to have all the games trade so I guess maybe it's more of

181
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,520
a friendly competition. It's a co-op game instead of a competitive game. I would have

182
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:27,240
liked to see maybe more ways that you could have pitted dogs up against each other to

183
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:31,960
see who the better trainer is. But I still think it's a very solid game. I think it's

184
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:37,920
a very Nintendo game. I think it's going to be a great DS title. And I think if this title

185
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,440
sounds appealing to you, give it the benefit of the doubt. Pick it up. There's a lot of

186
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,160
great deals out there right now. You never know. They might come out later with Nintendogs

187
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:49,360
training challenge or something, there'll be a revolution game and you'll put your

188
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,520
dogs in. Who knows? Or as we said last week on the show, holiday edition apparently has

189
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:57,880
been trademarked. Don't know if that's going to be something that actually happens, but

190
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:02,700
who knows? And I want to talk about DS expansions in one of our stories tonight because it's

191
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:07,640
very interesting the way they're expanding some of the DS games. Cool. Other than Nintendogs,

192
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:12,880
I really didn't play a whole lot of new stuff, just Final Fantasy XI. I apologize, Loki,

193
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,200
I didn't get to the copy of Hello Kitty Roller Rescue

194
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,400
that you gave me last week.

195
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,840
I haven't had a chance to hook up the GameCube,

196
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:21,800
so I'm trying to look for a better cable for it.

197
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,400
I need to get at least an S-video for my Hi-Def TV.

198
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,280
And Halo 2.

199
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,720
Last night, I went over to a friend's birthday party

200
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,720
and it was just a bunch of guys playing Halo 2.

201
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,000
And somehow we got the idea that we'd get our friend

202
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,560
who doesn't really play a lot of video games

203
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,460
but really likes to talk shit.

204
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:40,440
We'd get him really drunk and he just got online

205
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,080
and my friend who's really good at Halo,

206
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,360
you know, he's like a level 20 something

207
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,600
and all the head-to-head stuff.

208
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,280
We got him to actually control

209
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,840
and my friend to wear the headset.

210
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,960
So he just made fun of people the whole night.

211
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,880
And like made fun of people's names.

212
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,960
He was making fun of people on the same team and stuff.

213
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:57,660
Highly immature stuff, highly, highly amusing.

214
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,420
It was so funny because there was this girl

215
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:04,040
who ended up getting more kills than my friend in one match.

216
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,880
Either it was a girl or a little boy

217
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,100
who hadn't gone through puberty yet.

218
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,520
Because the boys was really high like this.

219
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:12,240
And the person was going, ha ha ha, I beat you, I beat you,

220
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,040
blah, blah, blah, and just doing this dance

221
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,200
in their living room or something

222
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,460
and yelling at us on Xbox Live, so.

223
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:21,180
The joys of Xbox Live and talking smack.

224
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,480
Not so much fun if you're on the receiving end though,

225
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,080
I bet.

226
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,500
Anyway, let's get to that story about the expansion pack,

227
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,000
actually, I'll start off with this story tonight.

228
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,440
This is actually a game we talked a little bit about

229
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,840
on the show, but I don't know of a US release

230
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,680
of this game yet, it's actually a Japanese game

231
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:42,100
called Jam with a Band, and it's kind of one of those ones

232
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,440
where you play the instruments on your DS,

233
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,060
and it's an interactive title.

234
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,380
This hasn't come out in the US yet,

235
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,720
but what is coming out in Japan,

236
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,180
apparently the game has been very successful in Japan,

237
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:54,260
so they're gonna be releasing an expansion pack,

238
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,580
but you have to have the DS game

239
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:57,020
to be able to use the expansion pack.

240
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:58,940
The way the expansion pack works,

241
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,760
it's a Game Boy Advance cartridge

242
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:03,220
that plugs into the bottom slot of your DS,

243
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:08,040
and so 20 songs are loaded into the DS cartridge,

244
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:11,860
songs that uh... i don't recognize a whole lot of these songs a lot of them

245
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,600
are uh... japanese titles

246
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,200
uh... except for one of them uh... and that's the new my new my a song is on

247
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,340
here that you know

248
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:21,200
drago stun tay or whatever's called that's in the expansion pack for jam the

249
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:21,680
band

250
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,360
uh... along with some nintendo favorite star fox sixty four super mario sixty

251
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,160
four d s

252
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,200
are all in this expansion back but i think that's very what's neat about the

253
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:33,300
story not so much the game but the method of delivering the expansion

254
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:36,680
and it's cool that you mentioned that uh... there's another game is coming out

255
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:44,720
similar to that Metroid Prime pinball they're doing a rumble pack that's gonna

256
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,680
be I know I heard about the rumble pack but is is that a DS game I can't that's

257
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,720
a DS game yeah I thought it was an advanced game first no it's a DS game I

258
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:55,040
can't keep track okay so it's a DS game but the rumble packs gonna plug into the

259
00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:00,680
it yes like see I knew there was more to that advanced slot than just Game Boy

260
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,420
advanced games if you think about it this goes all the way back to feel the

261
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:07,420
Magic XXY or whatever it is, one of the launch titles

262
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:10,340
where, secret trick, if you put in, I think it's

263
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:13,860
Sonic Adventure 2 in your GBA slot, you unlock

264
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:16,040
a Sonic costume on the DS cartridge.

265
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,380
So we've known forever the DS has this capability

266
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:21,500
to interact with whatever game is in the bottom slot.

267
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:25,380
So if a Nintendogs, hypothetically, if there is

268
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,760
this holiday edition and an expansion pack is delivered,

269
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:32,220
I'd bet ya either it's gonna be its own stand alone

270
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:35,040
cartridge where they try to get you to you know buy the same game over again

271
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,280
because you can get cute Santa hats for your puppy or it's going to be an

272
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:41,520
expansion pack which I think would be very cool imagine an expansion pack that

273
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:44,840
plugs in advance that would work with all three titles and maybe unlock a

274
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:48,560
particular breed of dog in no matter what game you own I know it'd be cool

275
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:53,940
we'll see though we'll see also in the news tonight I was talking about Halo a

276
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:57,280
little bit ago of course you guys probably heard that Halo is going to be

277
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:01,200
turned into a movie projected to be about 2007

278
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,200
for this movie to come out.

279
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,260
Fox and Universal were the ones that teamed up

280
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:06,840
to create this movie.

281
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,960
The script, as I understand, is being written by the guy

282
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,880
who did 28 Days Later, Alex Garland.

283
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,960
But at the same time, he also did The Beach.

284
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:18,720
So, could be hit or miss, could be hit or miss.

285
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,760
So we'll see, more news.

286
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,400
No stars attached yet, but I'm sure all of that

287
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,440
will develop a little bit later on.

288
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,440
Also, I wanna say about Halo.

289
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,020
This, I think, is very interesting.

290
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,880
There's gonna be a Halo Triple Pack

291
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,280
coming out before the end of the year.

292
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,200
Yeah, it's coming out in October.

293
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,200
It's gonna be $60, or as they say, $59.99,

294
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,160
but I say that's just $60.

295
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,960
It's gonna be Halo, Halo 2,

296
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,400
and the Halo 2 multiplayer map pack.

297
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,920
Now, usually if you bought these games together,

298
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,120
it would cost you about $80,

299
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,880
so it's kinda like, you know, you're getting a combo,

300
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,600
burgers, fries, and soda, right?

301
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,060
But my question is,

302
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:55,140
who that owns an Xbox

303
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:58,240
that who would this who's this

304
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,260
more are aimed at because if you own an Xbox

305
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:05,500
you have to own one of these games unless you're not a first-person shooter

306
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,060
type

307
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:09,740
but if that's the case I don't know why you own an Xbox but

308
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:13,380
no it all kidding aside though okay maybe there's no their sports titles

309
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,600
Ninja Gaiden you know there's other Xbox titles that are good

310
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,820
but I'd be very surprised that people who want

311
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:22,540
Halo don't already have it. The only thing I can come up with is that maybe

312
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:23,780
this is to kind of

313
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:27,660
get those people that are gonna make the Xbox 360

314
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:31,620
their first purchase and since the Xbox 360 they're saying is going to be

315
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:34,220
backwards compatible now. You know it's gonna be at least backwards compatible

316
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,300
with Halo if nothing else.

317
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:39,280
It keeps going back and forth. Some games, all games, some games, all games. At least

318
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,460
the Halos will be backwards compatible. This is going to be a good way to get people

319
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:46,620
you know to catch up on Halo who might be joining Microsoft with the Xbox 360

320
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:47,580
and didn't have an Xbox.

321
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:51,980
But my thought along with that is, who's gonna buy an Xbox 360 that

322
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:55,940
isn't already an Xbox fan? I don't know many people. You don't own an Xbox, right?

323
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:59,860
No. Are you gonna buy an Xbox 360? Probably just because it's the next-gen system.

324
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:01,860
Okay, then you're the only person I've talked to

325
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:04,860
that would plan to be buying an Xbox 360.

326
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:08,140
I guess there could be other folks out there. I mean, just because, you know,

327
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:12,100
really, I'm not buying it for Halo. If Halo comes out for it,

328
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:16,020
I'm not gonna buy it. Are you buying it for Final Fantasy XI, Pretty Edition? No, hell no.

329
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:20,940
I'm not buying for that. I'm buying for project author racing 3. That's what I'm buying it for that and Ridge Racer 6

330
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:25,780
Hell yeah, it's all about the racing games. So that's okay. Well, then I guess I stand corrected because

331
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:31,700
Feasibly with this lower price they could taunt someone like you into buying this. Although you're not a halo fan

332
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,700
I would not buy the stupid halo

333
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,740
Expansion pack and that crap you're not a halo fan

334
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:42,320
You think about it though halo tooth probably dropping price here pretty quick anyways to about 20 bucks and then they'll be just $60

335
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:46,400
anyway i disagree halo they're still asking $29.99 for halo 1

336
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,400
no it's not strapped down to $20 I saw it somewhere for $29.99

337
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:55,240
no but whatever mine came with my xbox i have a pretty green xbox so i didn't

338
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:55,940
have to worry about it

339
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:59,000
mine came with mine except on halo it was part of that you know

340
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,720
the best hits or whatever they call them platinum it is and it isn't

341
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,900
you know it's the best selling xbox game of all time but

342
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:09,920
they can still get away with charging $30 yeah you know see everything in this

343
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:14,720
this um... collection of ours is supposed to be $17.99 but uh...

344
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:19,380
we just want some more money for it. Speaking of Xbox 360 another story tonight this is

345
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,400
interesting I think

346
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,560
um... of course we had the price announcements last week where you know

who would buy that crap rich people

362
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:21,960
i mean seriously though you probably go shopping and get it for a lot cheaper

363
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,080
anyways

364
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,960
well i don't know

365
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,780
did not cut the break this like

366
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:30,020
let's put it all together make the biggest pack possible the news site you

367
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:33,820
written and you don't get price breaks released a usually though well you know

368
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:37,140
what i'm making a pack that's going to be to prove that you know two thousand

369
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,060
four hundred dollars

370
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:40,740

371
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,060

something to read tonight okay and I thought it was a good email so we're

386
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:38,740
gonna read this this comes to us from Flynn Flynn says hello I've just heard

387
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:43,860
my first podcast of your show courtesy of my PSP so I think it's very

388
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:47,460
interesting that he's downloading the show on the PSP because we're gonna if

389
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:52,020
you're a PSP owner we're gonna do something for you guys but we we're not

390
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:55,740
talking about it just yet we're working on it hopefully within the month oh yeah

391
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:59,980
Yeah, by the way, I forgot to mention this earlier this week, I bought another PSP.

392
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,380
So I have two PSPs now.

393
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:02,380
Sucker.

394
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,380
Alright, anyway.

395
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:06,820
So hello to those of you listening on your PSPs, we're gonna do something for you guys

396
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:08,820
pretty soon.

397
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:12,580
Flynn wanted to comment on what a listener named Rob had to say about virtual ethics

398
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:17,300
in regards to the Chinese exchange student using a bot to mug other players in Lineage

399
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:21,300
2 and sell their virtual loot for real cash.

400
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:27,940
Rob went on to say that virtual ethics, or ethics in not a real place, are inconsequential.

401
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:28,940
I can't talk tonight.

402
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:30,820
Too many syllables in that word.

403
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:34,900
I'm thinking about that Xbox DS and I'm seeing dollar signs all over, anyway.

404
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:39,100
Flynn says, there's a famous saying, ethics is what you do in the dark when no one's watching.

405
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:42,960
I can think of no darker a place than cyberspace where no one can watch.

406
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,780
Would you empty the contents of a lost wallet if no one knew you had it, or would you track

407
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:50,480
down the owner to return the wallet, knowing no reward would be given and they would never

408
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,240
find you if you did not.

409
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,560
Having never played Lineage 2, I can only assume that mugging and player killing are

410
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:59,560
part of the many wonderful experiences you can participate in during the game and that

411
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:02,720
the student had not hacked the program in order to create these things.

412
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,920
I actually tried to do a little research on it, well let me finish this letter.

413
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:10,240
I have also heard of people creating things in the virtual world to auction off for real

414
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,720
cash and as far as I know this is not illegal.

415
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:17,680
That being said, mugging and PKing and selling virtual loot in the real world should not

416
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,500
have led to an arrest in my opinion.

417
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,300
The only crime was maybe the creation of the bot program.

418
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,100
However, everyone should be crystal clear

419
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,220
in that his actions were unethical.

420
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:27,500
Do not believe for one second

421
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:30,180
that you are a good upstanding citizen in the real world

422
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:32,660
while treating people like garbage in the virtual world.

423
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:33,660
Very good point.

424
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:35,780
Doing awful things while hiding behind a screen name

425
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:38,740
or handle is just revealing your true nature in the dark.

426
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:40,380
That comes to us from Flynn.

427
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:41,220
Thank you for the email, Flynn.

428
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:43,180
I actually tried to do a little research

429
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:46,540
as to whether Lineage 2 has that mugging feature built in.

430
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:48,980
So I went to Google, you know, like Lineage 2 mugging.

431
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:52,900
And of course I just got a bunch of articles but I tried reading some, doing a little research

432
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:55,620
trying to see if mugging is something that's built into the game.

433
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:59,380
It's my understanding that although it sounds like PK is something that's built into the

434
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:05,500
game, what this person did is the person wrote a bot program to automate doing all of these

435
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:10,260
quests and doing things faster than a human can possibly do them.

436
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:12,440
So the bot would always win.

437
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,380
No matter what, the bot would win.

438
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:16,280
And the bot was basically unkillable.

439
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:20,680
So in a way he kind of, I guess, brought an exploit to light.

440
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:24,440
I don't know what you'd call it, but I definitely agree with Flynn that it was unethical, but

441
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:28,680
Flynn says maybe they went a little far in arresting the guy.

442
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,680
Your thoughts are welcome.

443
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,480
TwoGo at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

444
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:35,480
I don't know about unethical, I mean, because one could say if you create a better way of

445
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:40,400
doing something that's unethical, but I call it, you know, innovative.

446
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,400
You know what, though?

447
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,400
You know what, though?

448
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,400
There's a difference.

449
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,480
You're talking about cheating in Burnout 3 in single-player mode, right?

450
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:50,240
you what you were doing earlier this week that's I downloaded a save that's

451
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,840
that's different because you're only affecting your game if you want to just

452
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:57,160
like if you want to go on to what is it movie spoilers calm or whatever that

453
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:01,480
site is and you want to read the end to every movie that's out there go for it

454
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:07,720
have fun spoil the movies for yourselves have a blast but if you go and tell all

455
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:10,400
your friends about the spoilers somebody's gonna get pissed off at you

456
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,520
about it I think it's kind of similar you can ruin the game for yourself if

457
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,520
you want, but ruining the game for others is crossing the line. That's kind of the way

458
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,720
I look at it.

459
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,520
It's just like, and you know what's funny is it kind of makes me think about last night

460
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:26,760
playing Halo 2, or watching my buddies play Halo 2, somebody actually cheated a game.

461
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:31,460
They used a technique in Halo 2 called the lag, where basically, my friend was trying

462
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:37,100
to explain this, and I don't follow Halo 2 cheating at all, but apparently these guys

463
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:43,500
were hooking up the Xbox to their computer somehow so that they would always be the server,

464
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:47,360
And if they're the server, they can cause the other players to lag out and basically

465
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,180
kill them while they can't move.

466
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:53,320
And I was watching this happening, sure enough, every couple minutes, lag, lag, lag, my friends

467
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,320
are dead.

468
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,320
Lag, lag, lag, my friends are dead.

469
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,240
And everybody was bitching and complaining about this, so somebody was doing this and

470
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,720
the person had way many kills.

471
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:08,680
So you know, I mean, not only is that unethical in my opinion, but it's, get a life, seriously,

472
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:13,000
what do you have to gain from kicking some people's butts on Halo 2?

473
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,680
On a Saturday night nonetheless, go out and get laid.

474
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:22,680
Seriously, I realize we do an internet radio show where we talk about video games, but

475
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:25,800
we try to talk about balance between that and having a personal life.

476
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:30,400
So please kids, stop cheating on Halo 2 to make your internet penis feel bigger.

477
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:35,000
Go out and get laid, because I'll tell you what, an orgasm feels 10,000 times better

478
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,300
than owning some noob in Halo 2, at least in my opinion.

479
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:46,500
you feel differently? I don't know. Follow up to a previous story we talked about. You

480
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:50,340
know how we said that the firmware was going to be upgraded on the Sony PSP like two weeks

481
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:56,000
ago? Well they were a little bit late, finally came out, it was finally released, came out

482
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,420
this past week, and now it's available on Sony's site. So if you are interested in upgrading

483
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:05,080
your firmware to 2.0, you can go ahead and do that. What you're going to get, a new web

484
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:10,040
browser application. And it also has like a tabbing feature. You can have three tabs

485
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:15,400
of browser windows open at once, which is kind of neat. Other additions include four-three

486
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:21,440
ratio, so you can watch like TV programs, four-three screen mode. AAC and WAV audio

487
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:26,520
files are also added. Check out the PlayStation site if you want more details. I got to check

488
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:30,000
out, because I checked out on Loki's new PSP. He upgraded it to 2.0. I checked out the web

489
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,800
browser, and of course I'm loading OrangeLoungeRadio.com on the web browser, looking at it, and ooh,

490
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,800
Neat, I guess, neat.

491
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,800
It's a lot faster than the Wipeout browser, I'll give them that.

492
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,800
That's for sure, it's a lot faster than that.

493
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:50,800
And browsing is pretty easy. I don't like the stupid little text input that they have, but they're releasing a keyboard for it.

494
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,800
Where it's like a cell phone, like where you have to keep tapping.

495
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:56,800
Yeah, they're going to be releasing a keyboard, so, you know, whatever.

496
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,800
But they actually did improve, you know, their method of entering stuff in,

497
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:06,800
because you can see how many times you've got to tab the button to get to your next letter, but it's not that hard.

498
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:12,800
I mean, it's not going to be good for chatting or anything, but even some of the IRC programs that they've made for it,

499
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:19,800
like the one website, PSP IRC or something like that, they have a Java keyboard anyway, so you don't really need it.

500
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:23,640
needed. But they're gonna be adding, they said

501
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:28,080
that they're gonna be looking at Java or to expand the Java a bit

502
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,720
and to add Flash. Now that would be interesting because that would mean

503
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,840
you could download games

504
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:35,960
essentially to your PSP very easily, right? I don't know about...

505
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:39,440
Well, they're gonna have downloading games. In fact, there's a

506
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:44,960
campaign being launched in the UK for their PSP launch. It's called YourPSP.com

507
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:49,380
and they're gonna have movie trailers, downloadable games, and stuff like that

508
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:51,420
And so, I'll be interested when that happens.

509
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:54,140
And you could, essentially, if they're going to implement Flash,

510
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:57,220
then you would be able to download Strong Bad, right?

511
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:59,580
You could listen to that on your PSP, right?

512
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:02,500
Yeah, I guess you could.

513
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:06,820
So, do we really need Strong Bad to burninate your PSP?

514
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:10,740
Well, you know, a lot of the kids out there would like that, so...

515
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:13,540
I like Strong Bad, he's funny.

516
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:15,140
Moving on, what do you got for us tonight, Loki?

517
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:18,620
Well, we've got a couple things, a couple things in the rumor mills.

518
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:24,580
First off, starting at IGN did this nice little look at the Game Boy Micro, which is coming

519
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:27,260
out in September here in a couple weeks.

520
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:31,980
They did a bunch of size comparisons, and I can say that it's about the size of a stick

521
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:36,540
of gum, because they have a winter fresh gum thing next to it.

522
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:37,540
Honestly...

523
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:40,120
Looks more like the size of the guy's cell phone in the picture you have there.

524
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,380
It's just a small Game Boy Advance.

525
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:45,540
I mean, if you really want to buy it again, go for it, but I don't know.

526
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:48,100
I don't see the point of buying this thing.

527
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:52,700
Some people out there might like the accessory-ness of this.

528
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:53,700
I don't know.

529
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:56,860
Well, the people that buy this thing and like the fact that you can change the faceplates

530
00:29:56,860 --> 00:30:00,380
are the people that buy the stupid Game Boy Advances when they come out in different colors.

531
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:01,540
Do we really?

532
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:02,540
I mean, no.

533
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:05,700
I mean, no, I'm not buying that.

534
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:12,100
Anyways, the other thing was is they had some info on what they think is going to be revolutionary

535
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:15,140
about the Nintendo Revolution.

536
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:21,960
Now granted we're gonna know in a few weeks. What is revolutionary about it because on the 16th Nintendo's actually holding a press conference

537
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,380
They're gonna let all the cats out of the bag about time

538
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:30,640
So everything's gonna be known about the revolution, but in the meantime we could speculate to you know

539
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,840
The cows all right speculate away. Oh this speculation is supposedly by this guy

540
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,680
sponge or whatever he claims to

541
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:43,100
Know what's going on? And basically he's said that there's gonna be

542
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:48,680
be it's gonna make it so where that it's hard to turn the controller like tilt

543
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,360
the controller it's gonna have gyroscopes in it so it's gonna be like

544
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:55,000
kind of like an almost like the rumble pack but it's gonna make it so that it

545
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,920
feels like for example you're drifting around the corner it'll give you g

546
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:01,720
forces you know going to one direction or something I don't know how that's

547
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:04,820
gonna work but that's an interesting idea because it'll be revolutionary in

548
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:08,840
fact that this is a mid-dunt and the fact that gyroscopes spin revolutionary

549
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:12,160
Ah, cute. Cute.

550
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:16,360
That's a theory, but I don't know. My personal thing is I think it's gonna be

551
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:16,840
that

552
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:20,080
and I think if you've seen those keywords out there that have little LCD

553
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,000
buttons on them

554
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,840
where they can change what the button looks like, I think that's gonna be a

555
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:25,520
thing.

556
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:28,880
I think it's two things, but I don't know.

557
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,360
I'm totally speculating too, but we'll know in a couple weeks on the 16th.

558
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:35,680
All the speculation comes back to the controller, which I think is interesting.

559
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:40,680
Yeah, and they said that that would be revolutionary, I'd imagine, but I don't know if it's revolutionary

560
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,680
enough to sell the system.

561
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,680
You know what, though?

562
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:46,440
You're also assuming, though, when you're saying that it's a play on the name, that

563
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,600
the actual name of the system is going to be the revolution.

564
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,560
This is still a working title, correct?

565
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:54,100
They have not confirmed that this will be the actual name of the system.

566
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:56,640
And for the longest time, GameCube was what, Dolphin?

567
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,640
I think they were calling it?

568
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,640
Yeah.

569
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,640
Or was that the 64?

570
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,640
I don't know.

571
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,640
One or the other.

572
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,640
One of them, yeah.

573
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,640
And they changed the name before it was released.

574
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,440
So this may not actually be the Nintendo revolution.

575
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,760
we may get a new name coming up.

576
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:11,040
Yeah, just like the Xbox 360, what the hell was that?

577
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:14,680
I mean, 360, that's retarded.

578
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:18,880
Xbox 2, Xbox 360, why is it the 360?

579
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,160
Well, yeah, because we're going back around

580
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,640
and doing the same thing all over again, I don't know.

581
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,160
So anyways, there's that.

582
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:29,840
And speaking of the 360, and I mentioned this

583
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:33,720
a couple weeks ago about the Origin 360 site,

584
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:39,720
Well, it's changing. The site is changing, and there's more stuff happening.

585
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:49,720
Before, for those who might not remember, the Origin site had a picture of a tree with a countdown to sometime in September, and there was a bunny rabbit.

586
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:54,720
Bunny rabbits moved to the other side of the screen, the hole's getting bigger in the bottom of the tree, and there's apples growing.

587
00:32:54,720 --> 00:33:02,220
And one of the apples is a symbol for the Windows Messenger.

588
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:04,080
Which is interesting.

589
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:07,820
So integration with Windows messaging for Xbox 360?

590
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:08,820
Maybe?

591
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:09,820
Sure!

592
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:10,820
I mean, come on!

593
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:11,820
This is a Windows product, or a Microsoft product.

594
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:14,280
Of course they're going to have that.

595
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,660
Don't jump to conclusions, I mean, you never know.

596
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:21,460
It's just another viral site, if you really want to check it out, originxbox360.com, that's

597
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:24,900
That's O-R-I-G-E-N Xbox 360 dot com.

598
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,380
Go look at the pretty bunny.

599
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:32,340
And um, yeah, so I guess, you know, something's gonna happen with a bunny.

600
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:33,880
The controller will be a bunny, no?

601
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,580
I think the bunny should be a mascot.

602
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,280
We need a good bunny mascot.

603
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,660
It's a cardboard bunny, it doesn't do anything.

604
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:41,540
Fine, anything else?

605
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:44,900
I think it would have been funny though, if you keep going back to the site, there's more

606
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:49,180
bunnies appear or something like that, that'd be great.

607
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:51,180
No, really other than that

608
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:55,380
Well, I've got more hack and crack stuff, but we'll get into that later a little later. All right

609
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:57,380
Yeah, we'll do some more stories over here

610
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:01,900
Tamagotchi is coming out for the DS which shouldn't be much of a surprise when you consider that the Nintendo, you know

611
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:07,740
Nintendogs was kind of a you know could you could say inspired by Tamagotchi, but this is the weird thing

612
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:12,760
The Tamagotchi isn't game is not what you think. It's not like the old keychain game

613
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:17,020
It's gonna be released this winter bound I but of course in Japan

614
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:23,060
Tamagotchi Corner Shop, a simulation game set in the world of Tamagotchi and what you're

615
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:27,280
going to do is you're going to open up your own business and make it the best in the land.

616
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:34,060
You help Maimchi, Memi-chi, or Kupachi set up a shop and the ultimate goal is to become

617
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:36,100
Princess Tamako's favorite one.

618
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,100
Whatever.

619
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,100
Huh?

620
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,100
Yeah, whatever.

621
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,960
That's exactly what I said about this.

622
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:45,660
You can do a beauty salon or a flower shop and you do mini games with a DS stylus.

623
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:46,660
Huh?

624
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:49,020
yeah anyway

625
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:51,940
file that so it's uh...

626
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:56,420
harvest moon but with convenience stores with uh... characters that were pop

627
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:58,460
culture ten years ago

628
00:34:58,460 --> 00:34:59,220
you know

629
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:01,420
what speaking of uh...

630
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:02,780
so what are she uh...

631
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:06,420
mew pet starkest fairy comes out next month

632
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:07,260
who

633
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:10,060
the

634
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:14,980
and nintendo is buying back two point two million shares the possible reason

635
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:19,380
for this possible reason for this Square Enix trying to take over Taito. Nintendo

636
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:22,300
does not want to be taken over at this point. You know what I was thinking this

637
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:26,500
week in a completely random subject this is completely out of left field you know

638
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:32,040
I was thinking this week Apple and Nintendo should team up seriously Apple

639
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:36,580
and Nintendo should team up Apple is good at making cute stuff cute computers

640
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:40,500
cute systems and granted their systems do a lot of great stuff Loki I know you

641
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:44,580
disagree with this but I think that you know max they do their thing they're

642
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:48,420
just different it's another choice Nintendo is kind of different and cute

643
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:51,180
and does their own thing I think there's a partnership to be had here between

644
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:55,380
Apple and Nintendo I don't know I was just randomly thinking that the other day

645
00:35:55,380 --> 00:36:01,260
you know I think what what the hell there's like a sticker on here on your

646
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:06,580
DS yeah came with scratching of the stylus anyways I was thinking and just

647
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:11,660
when you mentioned the Apple and Nintendo I was just thinking the apples

648
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:17,660
are like the Volkswagen of the PC world. That's what they reminded me of.

649
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:20,660
You can address those cards and letters to Loki at orange-longstreet.com.

650
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:25,660
I mean, look, they release cute stuff that's in different colors. I mean, that's what Volkswagen does.

651
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:28,660
Cute cars suck, but...

652
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:32,660
Yeah, so by the way, in case you missed that underlying story within the story,

653
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:36,660
Square Enix made a $600 million bid for Taito this week, so...

654
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:40,660
And what did we try to do? We tried to figure out, what would it sound like if we combined all three...

655
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:42,660
Square Enix and Taito?

656
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:43,660
Squeedo.

657
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:44,660
Squeedo!

658
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:45,660
Squeedo.

659
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:46,660
I like Squeedo.

660
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:47,660
I like Squeedo too.

661
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:50,660
So the company will hereforth be known as Squeedo.

662
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:53,660
Assuming this goes through, which I don't see why it won't at this point.

663
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:54,660
I mean, who cares?

664
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:55,660
So what?

665
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:56,660
It's, you know...

666
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:58,660
I think it's a good thing.

667
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:00,660
Yeah, why not?

668
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:01,660
Metroid Prime.

669
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:02,660
You know how there was this big stink?

670
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:05,660
We even talked about this on the show a couple months ago, where folks were saying that,

671
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:07,660
oh, this game should have been online.

672
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:09,660
If you keep pushing this game back, it should have been online.

673
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:13,340
Why didn't you put this game online you keep pushing this back and Nintendo finally saying?

674
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:17,460
Metroid Prime going online

675
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:21,700
Prime hunters. Yes, Metroid Prime hunters. I'm sorry Metroid hunters will be going online

676
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:26,360
It will be compatible with the Nintendo's Wi-Fi service coming out later this year

677
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:29,460
Which got pushed back pride in November?

678
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:31,980
everything else

679
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:35,940
Can't intend to do any okay any game company do anything on time? I?

680
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:39,980
I wanted my Mario Kart god damn it for my birthday

681
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:43,020
and I had to wait until November that's not fair

682
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:48,220
that Animal Crossing sorry speaking of the DS Sony's flinging a little mud

683
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:49,420
calling the DS

684
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:52,460
a gimmick this week Sony

685
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:55,500
releasing some commentary this week

686
00:37:55,500 --> 00:38:00,140
vice president of the Sony Studios Phil Harrison making the following comments

687
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:04,100
on the idea of a handheld right over you with Nintendo is an irrelevance

688
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:08,100
Those formats don't appear in our planning. It's not a fair comparison. Not fair on them, I should stress.

689
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:11,100
That sounds arrogant, maybe, but that's the truth.

690
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:15,100
We're just bitter that they're outselling this to Japan! By a lot!

691
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:17,100
But, here's the interesting quote here now.

692
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:22,100
But I fear that it won't have a lasting impact beyond that of a gimmick.

693
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:27,100
So the long-lasting appeal of the platform is at peril as a direct result of that.

694
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:31,100
Yeah, do you think that the DS is going to be the last handheld system? No.

695
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:35,380
Here's another one. Nintendo knows its target audience because it has really

696
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:38,860
narrowed that down and it's pretty much defined by a boy or girl's ability to

697
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:39,940
admire Pokemon.

698
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:46,380
Ooh, burn! Yeah, and what's the PSP had released for now?

699
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:50,100
Oh, rehashes of crappy games that were out on the PlayStation.

700
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:54,820
Yeah, I, you know, I like the PSP and I don't want to take sides in the PSP

701
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:57,780
versus DS War because the PSP does have a lot of great features,

702
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:01,460
especially in the fact that it's a multimedia system. However, in games,

703
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:05,780
PSP's lacking a little bit right now. Realize there's good stuff on the horizon

704
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:07,420
like Grand Theft Auto, but you know,

705
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:11,820
as far as I'm concerned, don't start making these comments till you get the games to back it up.

706
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:15,540
Because Luminous is just one game. Seriously, I have both.

707
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:20,180
And you know what? I'm looking at the lineup of games coming out for the PSP.

708
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:24,820
Ain't nothing impressive. But earlier, you know, I bet if we went back to

709
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:27,900
to archives of the show from february you would hear me saying the same crap

710
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:32,620
about the DS right before the PSP came out where DS needs to put out some games

711
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:38,020
show the system but they've done that now! Meteos, Nintendogs, the Prime

712
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:39,820
DS has a ton of stuff coming out

713
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:41,020
a ton of stuff

714
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:42,780
just being released PSP

715
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,460
one or two a month

716
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:46,140
with UMDs galore

717
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:47,660
but yeah tons of movies

718
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:52,180
good good for movies but uh... you know what it's a gaming system

719
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:55,740
it's a gaming system, not an internet browser, not a movie player

720
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:59,660
it's a gaming system. Well now here's something that the PSP can do that the

721
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:02,460
Nintendo can't do to try and curb some of those hate mails we're going to get

722
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:04,140
from Sony fans because there is

723
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:07,460
this feature that the PSP is going to do that the Nintendo DS cannot do

724
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:11,380
and that's custom soundtracks. Now of course you know this feature from the Xbox

725
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:14,540
but when the PSP launches in Europe this week, which by the way

726
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:18,020
PSP is launching in Europe this week, one of the games that's going to be released

727
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:20,320
for it is going to let you have a custom soundtrack and it's

728
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:24,160
Tokka Race Driver 2. You can have a custom soundtrack option

729
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,940
and if you have music stored on your memory stick you can use that as the

730
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:28,120
music you listen to in-game.

731
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:31,160
It's pretty cool. That's a cool idea. Now there you go.

732
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:36,000
Now to use the feature, by the way, you have to download the free

733
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,580
exact audio copy utility from Codemasters

734
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:43,760
UK website. That's codemasters.co.uk

735
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:49,640
So check that out. North American release not announced yet but

736
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:52,640
Codemasters does bring a lot of their Europe games over here.

737
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,640
Toca is one.

738
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:56,640
I'm sure it will be here in a minute.

739
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:57,640
What else you got for us tonight, Loki?

740
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:04,640
Well, speaking of the PSP, lots of stuff when it comes to doing things on the PSP that you're not supposed to.

741
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:09,640
Number one would be they found a way, or I should say it's going to be released next week,

742
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:18,640
they found a way to turn back the clock or to bring the PSP from version 1.52 or 1.51

743
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:23,120
back to 1.5. So like a DD level

744
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:26,480
your PSP, for lack of a better term. Basically you can

745
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:30,440
take your PSP and turn it back to 1.5

746
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:34,000
only if you haven't upgraded to 2.0 because stuff gets a little

747
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,920
different when you get to 2.0. However though the other thing you can do though

748
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:38,680
with it

749
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:42,240
they released another program this week to basically spoof

750
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:46,080
what version your PSP is so for those games that want you to upgrade to 2.0

751
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:50,040
or to you know 1.5 or whatever you can make it look like that your PSP is a

752
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:50,960
1.5 or

753
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:55,240
2.0 or whatever. So it's kinda interesting.

754
00:41:55,240 --> 00:42:00,820
Then other than that there's some major development in this new

755
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:04,580
GUI that this guy's coming out with called P6 which

756
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:09,200
looks amazing. It's got actually, they've done everything from being able to play

757
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,600
videos. It looks just like Windows

758
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:14,560
sort of. You can play audio files and that type of stuff. Homebrew.

759
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:17,760
Wait, so this is a... It's like a shell.

760
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:22,920
Okay, for PSP? For PSP. It alters the way things look and feel.

761
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:26,560
Yeah. Okay. What's also cool about it though, they've added a ton of other stuff like, for

762
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:27,280
example,

763
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:30,400
they are using a camera phone,

764
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:34,680
this add-on for some Sony Ericsson camera phone

765
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:37,920
to actually be able to have

766
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:42,480
a webcam on it. So you can actually take pictures with your PSP,

767
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:45,800
which is very interesting actually.

768
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:49,680
So that's going to be coming out and I'm sure they're going to have a web browser and stuff.

769
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:52,680
Tons of work being done on it.

770
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:57,440
Website with more info for this? They have a PSPupdates.com has an

771
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,760
interview actually with the guy

772
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:03,040
goes by the name Fluff. They were hosting some

773
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:06,320
cool like kind of a teaser

774
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:09,960
videos for it too and it looks really cool from what I've seen so far.

775
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:12,200
just to double check you've had on

776
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:16,920
psp hack stories from a guy named sponge and a guy named fluff correct

777
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:18,220
yes gauges

778
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:20,080
just verifying that

779
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:22,560
uh... the other thing i was going to mention this should make you a little

780
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,520
bit excited there rob uh...

781
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:29,000
stella has been ported over to the psp it's hard to a six hundred yes that's

782
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:33,800
awesome and it's still there working on getting the speed up but uh...

783
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:38,980
still off adventure time it's time to play some sort quest here i come nobody

784
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:44,120
need to do? Stella with some like, you know, ad hoc compatibility. How about Stella with

785
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:48,860
some wireless multiplayer? Second play two player combat. Yeah combat, it's on. That'd

786
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:54,300
be awesome. They need to make a new combat game. Atari needs to remake combat. We need

787
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:57,860
to have a petition for them to remake combat. Didn't they? I thought it was one, cause you

788
00:43:57,860 --> 00:44:01,920
know how they remade Pong and uh, what else? I don't think they did combat. I know they

789
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:08,420
did Pong, I know they did Spogger. Oh Pac-Man, so I guess Namco. Alright, but all these Atari

790
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:13,180
Warlords was one. Didn't they do combat?

791
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:16,780
They might have done combat. Well, whatever. They should do it again.

792
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:20,380
Make it better. But here's the thing is the PSP needs more games that are

793
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:20,940
actually

794
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:24,300
over the internet. You know, they've got like a couple so far.

795
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:29,140
It took the DS a year, so give the PSP until E3 next year.

796
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:32,540
I don't know. I mean, that was one of the things that they're pushing. You can play

797
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:33,580
people over the internet!

798
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:37,180
Not yet. We'll see.

799
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:39,580
All right, is that it?

800
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:40,980
That's for now, yeah.

801
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:42,940
You know the only thing, though, about Stella, though,

802
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:45,200
and Atari 2600 emulation, you know, in all honesty,

803
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:47,860
even though I talk wonderful things about these games,

804
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:49,420
Kaboom, of course, but another one of my favorites,

805
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:50,740
Pitfall 2, love it.

806
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:54,420
The emulation thrill usually lasts about five minutes.

807
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:56,620
And then it's like, oh, isn't that cute,

808
00:44:56,620 --> 00:44:57,460
let's move on the road.

809
00:44:57,460 --> 00:44:58,300
I mean, the fact that you can download

810
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:00,900
every single game ever made for the Atari,

811
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:04,580
and fit it under six megs, that's, yeah.

812
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:07,500
That's just technology, that's just technology.

813
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:09,660
Ragnarok 2, I know we got a lot of listeners

814
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:11,140
that are really into Ragnarok Online,

815
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:12,500
and I'm sure if Dark Sakura were here,

816
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:14,700
she'd be saying something about this.

817
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:17,580
At the Ragnarok Festival, which was held in July,

818
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:21,500
Gravity said that they will reveal Ragnarok 2 Online

819
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:23,200
at the Tokyo Game Show.

820
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,580
The show is taking place September 16th,

821
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:27,700
so if you're a fan of Ragnarok Online,

822
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:30,120
stay tuned to September and the Tokyo Game Show,

823
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:31,420
because they're gonna have more information

824
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:33,060
about Ragnarok 2.

825
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:34,420
That's really all I've got to say about that.

826
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:36,620
There was nothing else in that story.

827
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:41,000
Tekken 5 is going to be re-released in the arcades

828
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,200
as Tekken 5 Dark Resurrection,

829
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:45,840
and it's gonna have two new characters

830
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:48,440
as well as some newly rendered backgrounds.

831
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:51,360
It's gonna be shown at the Amusement Machine Show in Japan

832
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:53,960
on September 1st, and should make its way

833
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,560
to arcades this winter.

834
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:58,440
FYI, they're also gonna be showing

835
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:01,280
some other interesting Namco games at this show.

836
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:04,000
Druaga Online, which I think is really weird.

837
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,840
Suddenly, Druaga is really big with Namco again.

838
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:09,140
You might remember this old, old, old, old game

839
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:11,440
in the arcades, Tower of Druaga, I think it is.

840
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:14,360
Well, they recently released a PS2 Druaga title,

841
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:17,040
and now they've got Druaga Online, so I guess they,

842
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,760
and I didn't, maybe it was one of those things

843
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:20,540
that was big in Japan, and I just missed it somehow,

844
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:21,780
but I don't know.

845
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:24,080
As far as I know, that series was dormant for like 20 years,

846
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:26,280
but I could be wrong, don't send hate mail.

847
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:31,080
Soul Calibur 3 has a date for Japan, November 24th,

848
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:33,360
Which is a little bit sooner than I expected

849
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:39,880
November 24th for Japan get this October 25th for America. I thought that this was a game

850
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:42,620
We wouldn't be getting till next year apparently I fell asleep on this one

851
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:50,120
For new characters according to Famitsu magazine that are also going to be in this game Soulcalibur 3 maxi songmina

852
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:54,320
Zangwa and young sung will also be in Soulcalibur 3 hmm

853
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:58,240
And that's in addition to those previously announced characters and of course make your own characters

854
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:03,360
Soulcalibur 3 will also be having a battle arena mode where you can like set certain

855
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:06,040
conditions for the fight to be able to win the fight.

856
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:11,260
So might make for some interesting challenges, I don't know.

857
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:14,980
There's also coin, I guess these are things that are built in battle arena, I'm not sure,

858
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:19,280
coin collector where you have to collect as many coins as you can by attacking the opponent

859
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:21,960
and the coins you get are based on the attacks that you land on the opponent.

860
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:23,560
Soulcalibur party or something?

861
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:25,400
I don't know.

862
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:30,300
The Statue Dances is another mode where you fight against a large stone statue that's

863
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:40,300
eight times the size of your character, and it attacks, because you're fast, but the statue

864
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:44,000
is very slow, but it's very powerful, so you have to be quick.

865
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
I guess.

866
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
The Statue Dances.

867
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
So, everybody party!

868
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Interesting.

869
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:54,640
You know, they're doing interesting things with it, I think it'll be kind of cool.

870
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:59,000
Nintendo, of course with their release of Nintendogs, they have a new partnership between

871
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:05,120
Dogs Trust for the American and European release of Nintendogs, just to kind of remind people

872
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:11,720
that you know, raising a puppy in real life is a lot more complicated than it is in Nintendogs.

873
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:16,800
You can't turn off a real puppy, so, and I noticed this in the manual of the game even,

874
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:20,920
there's this big disclaimer about you know, if you want to get a real puppy, keep in mind

875
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:25,200
They don't stay puppies forever something to that effect, so if you own Nintendogs check it out

876
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:27,460
It's in the front of the manual an interesting little disclaimer there

877
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:35,620
Dogs trust their marketing director Adrian brooder saying dogs trust is pleased to be associated with Nintendogs the philosophy

878
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:41,340
Philosophy behind the game has a lot in common with our own aims of ensuring that every dog is a happy and loved pet

879
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:47,220
Despite the fame of our dog is for life slogan thousands of dogs are still abandoned and unwanted every year

880
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:53,260
So it's great that there's a game that's not only fun to play but supports the message that responsible dog ownership means more than giving

881
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:55,260
your dog an occasional stroke

882
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:57,920
He could have used better word choice there, but whatever

883
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:05,220
I only think of South Park right now. I don't get ready to rock you ready to rock it

884
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:12,180
Ah any more stories for us Loki, you know, I don't I just reading there's some interesting thing

885
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:18,020
They're talking about online, you know poker sites and people bodying on that and winning real money. Ooh

886
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:22,040
It's just a matter of time before something like that happens

887
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:23,860
interesting

888
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:28,500
Mmm, because when I was when I was that email I read today when I was doing some of the research

889
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:32,780
I actually was reading comments on I don't slash dot or some other site where people were saying if

890
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:39,220
Somebody it's just a matter of time before somebody does this in a game where it's real money at stake as opposed to

891
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:42,820
to fake items worth real money in the online auction world.

892
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:45,540
Yeah, I guess it's on this game called Win Hold'em.

893
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:53,400
And I guess it's articles about the rise of internet botting.

894
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,140
And they're talking about on the internet,

895
00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:56,260
nobody knows you're a bot.

896
00:49:56,260 --> 00:50:02,300
And I guess last year, poker sites raked in $1.4 billion.

897
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:06,260
And I mean, just someone runs a bot,

898
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:08,940
and they can win tons of money.

899
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:11,440
kinda crazy

900
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:13,780
interesting yeah

901
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:17,320
alright I guess we're on to our last story of the night

902
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:20,580
and the last story of the night has to do with male nudity in a video game

903
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:25,380
oh god. I'm sure Tark's soccer warriors should be very happy right now

904
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:28,420
no no don't shut off your iPod just yet no no don't turn it off

905
00:50:28,420 --> 00:50:31,780
there's actually more to this story here um it's actually

906
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:35,820
a midway game and it's their blitz series so it's like a football series of

907
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:36,300
games

908
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:40,640
Yeah, Blitz the League because, you know, they can't use NFL anymore.

909
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:44,020
Yeah, exactly, so they don't do this, so it's just Blitz the League.

910
00:50:44,020 --> 00:50:48,260
Now, what's interesting is that supposedly, you know, rumor is it's one of their viral

911
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:51,980
marketers, you know, the people that, you know, pose as regular fans that are

912
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:56,140
infiltrating the message board. Well, there was a post on the Midway message boards

913
00:50:56,140 --> 00:50:59,540
that's a screenshot from Blitz the League, and it shows

914
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:03,300
a cheerleader about ready to pull her shirt off, so, you know, gonna show her boobs,

915
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:04,780
which is nothing new in a video game.

916
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:09,900
But what's also interesting about it is that there's a streaker running through the middle

917
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:15,400
of the football game about ready to rip off his tighty-whities he's got on there.

918
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:20,780
So you can see here in this screenshot posted on this website that there's the lady there

919
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:26,460
about ready to rip her top off, and a male streaker about ready to take it all off.

920
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:31,820
Well Blitz the League, because they basically went this way, they were like, well, we can't

921
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:36,380
use the NFL licensing anymore so we're gonna make the game a couple things

922
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:43,020
violent we're gonna add drug use and we're gonna you know add nudity I guess

923
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:46,780
so it's a mature out of all the football games that come out this is a mature

924
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:52,220
rated football game the rest are for everybody well no I'm interested

925
00:51:52,220 --> 00:51:55,820
because you know NFL blitz was awesome so this should be no different

926
00:51:55,820 --> 00:51:59,780
props to Midway for thinking creative I guess they you know those games like

927
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:02,540
madden and stuff even though you know we don't talk a whole lot about sports

928
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:06,020
games because honestly I really just don't play them madden was a disappointment

929
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:09,580
from what I've heard from people I've been playing they're like yeah but but

930
00:52:09,580 --> 00:52:12,780
previous sports titles all these EA sports house they get more and more

931
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:15,940
realistic and they start feeling like you're watching Monday Night Football

932
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:19,860
Midways taking that one step further with the realism aspect by having the

933
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:27,300
streakers so interesting final thoughts Loki tonight I'll check out that game

934
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:32,540
Midway's coming in next week, so I'll have some questions for them.

935
00:52:32,540 --> 00:52:34,540
Alright, sounds good.

936
00:52:34,540 --> 00:52:37,900
My final thought is, thank you guys very much for listening, and hey, send us an email,

937
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:41,920
let us know how we're doing, togo, t-o-g-o, at orangelandrito.com, or if you want to contact

938
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:46,140
one of us directly, you know, send Loki some hate mail, or me some fan mail, you can always

939
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:51,760
check that out on our website, www.orangelandrito.com, and apologies to fans of our three hour show

940
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:56,180
that didn't get to hear us this Sunday because we had to cancel our live show this week.

941
00:52:56,180 --> 00:52:57,220
We'll be back next week.

942
00:52:57,220 --> 00:52:59,180
Got lots of music for you for next week.

943
00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:00,820
Yes, we got a lot of Imani remixes coming up

944
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:01,660
on next week's show.

945
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:04,880
And I got a big Tomo, which is the distributor

946
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:07,500
of H-Tech to make a RPG make for the PSP.

947
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:08,880
That's my goal next week.

948
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:09,720
Very cool.

949
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:11,900
And I received a bucket load of information

950
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:13,280
on Percussion Master this week,

951
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:15,160
so I'm gonna be talking about that next week's show.

952
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:16,000
Okay.

953
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:16,820
All right.

954
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:17,660
Anyway, that's that.
