[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, everybody out there who's subscribed to our podcast.

5
00:00:24,272 --> 00:00:26,833
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition.

6
00:00:27,623 --> 00:00:35,358
[SPEAKER_01]: You're home for chat about video games that don't suck, and sometimes we do have to talk about those games that do suck, but only to tell you to avoid them.

7
00:00:35,811 --> 00:00:38,273
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

8
00:01:02,751 --> 00:01:08,175
[SPEAKER_01]: Hurricane Katrina is expected to land, so definitely our thoughts are with you guys, and we really hope for the best for you guys.

9
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:11,637
[SPEAKER_01]: Joining us tonight as well, though, is the one and only Loki.

10
00:01:12,418 --> 00:01:13,078
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I'm here.

11
00:01:13,639 --> 00:01:14,159
[SPEAKER_01]: How you doing?

12
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:16,020
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm awake.

13
00:01:16,421 --> 00:01:17,281
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I think.

14
00:01:17,922 --> 00:01:19,303
[SPEAKER_01]: Busy week?

15
00:01:19,663 --> 00:01:21,024
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but this week will be.

16
00:01:21,772 --> 00:01:23,072
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you got going on this next week?

17
00:01:23,092 --> 00:01:26,553
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got 19 game publishers coming to my work this week.

18
00:01:26,613 --> 00:01:27,213
[SPEAKER_01]: 19 game publishers.

19
00:01:27,233 --> 00:01:33,794
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, for those folks that don't know what Loki does, he does freely talk about his work on here, and you even have co-workers that listen to this show, huh?

20
00:01:33,954 --> 00:01:34,154
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

21
00:01:34,274 --> 00:01:35,634
[SPEAKER_01]: And they don't care that you talk about this stuff?

22
00:01:35,834 --> 00:01:36,034
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

23
00:01:36,355 --> 00:01:36,675
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, cool.

24
00:01:36,695 --> 00:01:37,475
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, then tell them what you do.

25
00:01:38,695 --> 00:01:47,176
[SPEAKER_02]: I work for a video distribution company called VPD, second largest in the United States, and I'm one of the game sales reps there.

26
00:01:47,256 --> 00:01:49,897
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, basically we've got these...

27
00:01:51,223 --> 00:01:56,567
[SPEAKER_02]: Gameholders are coming in to check out what the company is about because they're not familiar with VPD.

28
00:01:56,607 --> 00:02:01,492
[SPEAKER_02]: They just know the old company that we bought out, which was VBC, Video Bicycling.

29
00:02:01,612 --> 00:02:03,353
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're going to come check out the place.

30
00:02:03,954 --> 00:02:05,915
[SPEAKER_02]: On Tuesday, they're having a party for them.

31
00:02:06,075 --> 00:02:09,518
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to be bringing in foosball tables, pool tables.

32
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:11,780
[SPEAKER_01]: Typical schmooze up to the corporate folks.

33
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,921
[SPEAKER_02]: Barbecue, that kind of stuff.

34
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:13,691
[SPEAKER_02]: ActaVision

35
00:02:31,732 --> 00:02:34,513
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be the next Grand Theft Auto, basically, but in the Old West.

36
00:02:34,533 --> 00:02:35,213
[SPEAKER_01]: What's Gun?

37
00:02:35,253 --> 00:02:36,353
[SPEAKER_01]: I have not heard of this.

38
00:02:36,373 --> 00:02:47,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Gun is pretty much an open kind of action game, very similar to Grand Theft Auto, where you can do whatever you want, pretty much, and they have a main story that goes along with that, but it's set in the Wild West.

39
00:02:47,775 --> 00:02:53,156
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can go mine gold, you can go scalp people, you can just do all that sort of stuff.

40
00:02:53,516 --> 00:02:55,537
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like Deadwood, that show on HBO?

41
00:02:56,857 --> 00:02:57,997
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like Red Dead Revolver.

42
00:02:58,237 --> 00:03:00,838
[SPEAKER_01]: It's set in the Wild West, but they all say, you know...

43
00:03:01,345 --> 00:03:02,386
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

44
00:03:30,851 --> 00:03:33,012
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all, yeah, we read it on that site, Advent Children.

45
00:03:33,052 --> 00:03:34,952
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because I, or AdventChildren.net.

46
00:03:35,012 --> 00:03:37,013
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because I posted it on there, you dumbass.

47
00:03:38,533 --> 00:03:41,214
[SPEAKER_02]: No, everybody still doesn't believe that's coming out that day.

48
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:46,096
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hearing, I can't remember who the hell I heard this from.

49
00:03:46,496 --> 00:03:51,618
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to say it might have even been you, but about why Advent Children's being delayed.

50
00:03:53,118 --> 00:03:53,618
[SPEAKER_01]: The rumor?

51
00:03:53,638 --> 00:03:55,619
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, rumor of a rumor, guys.

52
00:03:55,679 --> 00:03:56,879
[SPEAKER_01]: Take this with a grain of salt.

53
00:03:57,339 --> 00:03:59,320
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of those, like,

54
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:00,400
[SPEAKER_01]: and so on.

55
00:04:24,383 --> 00:04:27,686
[SPEAKER_01]: Take it with a grain of salt, guys, but just imagine the possibilities.

56
00:04:27,706 --> 00:04:39,756
[SPEAKER_01]: And if that's true, that it is, I mean, if we're talking limited IMAX engagement, we're talking very similar to what's going on in Tokyo, or not Tokyo, Japan, in cities like Tokyo, where they are going to be showing it in only like three or four cities for like a week.

57
00:04:39,936 --> 00:04:41,637
[SPEAKER_01]: That would probably be what happens here.

58
00:04:42,098 --> 00:04:44,600
[SPEAKER_01]: But take it with a grain of salt, guys.

59
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,060
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

60
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:45,560
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

61
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:52,206
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, either way, it's coming out on November 29th, which is, you know, Tuesday, right before the holiday, you know.

62
00:04:53,515 --> 00:04:59,436
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, I wish it were coming out sooner, but that's the way they told me.

63
00:04:59,696 --> 00:05:01,337
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, oh no, why?

64
00:05:01,597 --> 00:05:05,817
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the big gaming sites are agreeing with you now, so I was reading them this week.

65
00:05:05,837 --> 00:05:12,298
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, I mean, it's been pushed back a few times, so everyone's like, well, the Square Enix site's still saying it's coming out September.

66
00:05:12,359 --> 00:05:17,299
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well, that's because they have nothing to do with the date that it comes out in, so whatever.

67
00:05:17,799 --> 00:05:19,440
[SPEAKER_02]: But, yeah, so that's what's going on.

68
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:20,620
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, all right.

69
00:05:21,965 --> 00:05:28,567
[SPEAKER_01]: So, well, let's start off tonight's show by talking about, even though we've kind of already been talking about some games, we typically try to get this out in the beginning.

70
00:05:28,627 --> 00:05:30,447
[SPEAKER_01]: What games have we been playing this week?

71
00:05:30,507 --> 00:05:32,007
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Loki, what have you been up to this week?

72
00:05:32,167 --> 00:05:34,828
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I've been playing a couple things.

73
00:05:35,788 --> 00:05:38,089
[SPEAKER_02]: Burnout 3, still, of course.

74
00:05:38,289 --> 00:05:42,890
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm almost done with it because we decided to cheat and unlock everything.

75
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:46,290
[SPEAKER_02]: So, because we got, you know, we got tired of playing the same track over and over.

76
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:49,431
[SPEAKER_02]: We're still playing it, though, because we now have really fast cars and

77
00:05:50,134 --> 00:05:57,298
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still even more fun to race, but I was also playing a little bit of Pack Picks.

78
00:05:57,678 --> 00:05:58,218
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried that.

79
00:05:58,899 --> 00:05:59,259
[SPEAKER_02]: How was that?

80
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:00,199
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw that you picked that up.

81
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:00,800
[SPEAKER_02]: How was that game?

82
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:05,462
[SPEAKER_02]: It was one of those random buys I did, and it's okay.

83
00:06:05,922 --> 00:06:09,004
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just not really kind of feeling the game.

84
00:06:09,084 --> 00:06:10,204
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just kind of like, eh.

85
00:06:10,445 --> 00:06:16,908
[SPEAKER_01]: It was one of those things where I played the tech demo at E3 a year and a half ago when the DS was first being shown.

86
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:41,800
[SPEAKER_01]: and I then I heard that they were making it into a game and I was kind of like you're gonna take this concept and make it an actual game I mean I can see this being a minigame but from what I understand it came out okay like the best that that concept possibly could but it's it's it's okay but it's just like kind of it's it's like one of those things like oh but maybe it should be a minigame to something or maybe it should be like I don't know uh

87
00:06:42,486 --> 00:06:42,706
[SPEAKER_02]: It's okay.

88
00:07:09,798 --> 00:07:11,399
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's probably not worth $30.

89
00:07:11,539 --> 00:07:13,860
[SPEAKER_02]: I paid for it, but it's still okay.

90
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,620
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait for the bargain bin.

91
00:07:15,561 --> 00:07:16,201
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.

92
00:07:16,261 --> 00:07:19,543
[SPEAKER_02]: For a lot of the DS games, wait for the bargain bin.

93
00:07:19,563 --> 00:07:20,103
[SPEAKER_01]: $35 is a lot.

94
00:07:20,403 --> 00:07:21,004
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I don't know.

95
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:21,584
[SPEAKER_01]: I disagree with you.

96
00:07:21,604 --> 00:07:23,545
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Meteos is definitely worth the price.

97
00:07:25,306 --> 00:07:33,930
[SPEAKER_01]: Nintendogs, which I'm sure you're about to get to in a minute, is depending on if it's your kind of game, because you already know if you'd like Nintendogs or not, honestly.

98
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:34,630
[SPEAKER_01]: You already know.

99
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:36,431
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have to tell you if it's a good or bad game.

100
00:07:37,072 --> 00:07:37,812
[SPEAKER_01]: You would know...

101
00:07:38,419 --> 00:07:40,080
[SPEAKER_01]: If you like these virtual pet kind of games.

102
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:43,942
[SPEAKER_01]: So, sorry to steal your thunder, but I'm sure you've been playing a lot of Nintendogs as well.

103
00:07:45,283 --> 00:07:46,744
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been playing a little bit of Nintendogs.

104
00:07:47,164 --> 00:07:47,584
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit?

105
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:48,985
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I bought all three.

106
00:07:50,146 --> 00:07:56,069
[SPEAKER_01]: Why did you buy all three when you can unlock all the dogs in one cartridge if you just network well enough?

107
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:57,830
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

108
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:00,652
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know that, so I just bought all three.

109
00:08:00,812 --> 00:08:01,232
[SPEAKER_01]: Sucker.

110
00:08:02,693 --> 00:08:03,794
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, whatever.

111
00:08:03,814 --> 00:08:04,754
[SPEAKER_02]: It's okay.

112
00:08:05,855 --> 00:08:06,095
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

113
00:08:06,468 --> 00:08:07,329
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything else you've been playing this week?

114
00:08:07,349 --> 00:08:07,709
[SPEAKER_01]: Burnout?

115
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:08,430
[SPEAKER_01]: Nintendogs?

116
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:10,272
[SPEAKER_01]: What did you think of Nintendogs?

117
00:08:10,572 --> 00:08:11,513
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it everything you'd hoped for?

118
00:08:12,334 --> 00:08:14,997
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but the thing's kind of needy.

119
00:08:16,778 --> 00:08:24,166
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have enough time to play this game and other games at the same time, so that's kind of tough.

120
00:08:25,273 --> 00:08:28,194
[SPEAKER_01]: yet you would log into Final Fantasy XI for hours on end.

121
00:08:28,534 --> 00:08:29,674
[SPEAKER_01]: That wasn't a problem.

122
00:08:29,714 --> 00:08:31,775
[SPEAKER_02]: I played a little bit of Final Fantasy XI this week.

123
00:08:32,555 --> 00:08:35,996
[SPEAKER_02]: I logged in for a couple hours because I hadn't played for two months.

124
00:08:36,276 --> 00:08:38,356
[SPEAKER_02]: I felt obligated.

125
00:08:40,557 --> 00:08:41,317
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

126
00:08:41,757 --> 00:08:42,637
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all the games you've been playing?

127
00:08:42,757 --> 00:08:43,678
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I've been playing.

128
00:08:43,698 --> 00:08:44,538
[SPEAKER_02]: Next week should be better.

129
00:08:44,618 --> 00:08:46,598
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I played Marvel Nemesis Rise of the Imperfects.

130
00:08:46,618 --> 00:08:48,159
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the other one.

131
00:08:48,299 --> 00:08:52,440
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an awesome fighting game that they're going to be coming out with in September here.

132
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:52,940
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just

133
00:08:53,479 --> 00:08:54,320
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, it was really neat.

134
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:57,702
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got all the characters, plus they have these ones that EA actually made up.

135
00:08:58,162 --> 00:08:59,003
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was kind of neat.

136
00:09:01,464 --> 00:09:02,485
[SPEAKER_01]: Games I've been playing this week.

137
00:09:03,466 --> 00:09:04,426
[SPEAKER_01]: Nintendogs, of course.

138
00:09:04,567 --> 00:09:05,607
[SPEAKER_01]: I ran out and picked that one up.

139
00:09:06,168 --> 00:09:10,431
[SPEAKER_01]: I picked up the one that had the Shih Tzu in it, because as I promised everybody out there, I was going to get a Shih Tzu.

140
00:09:10,891 --> 00:09:13,813
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did have a Shih Tzu for a little while, but unfortunately, because...

141
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:16,120
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

142
00:09:39,099 --> 00:09:44,123
[SPEAKER_01]: and um did it translate well into a full game the five minute demo that they had at E3?

143
00:09:44,563 --> 00:10:02,457
[SPEAKER_01]: I think in most ways yes it did certainly in the very Nintendo way the cuteness factor the collectability aspect of it that's very you know Pokemon-ish and Animal Crossing-ish and other Nintendo games that they're famous for I think it really does deliver on all that and I really think it's a

144
00:10:03,884 --> 00:10:10,900
[SPEAKER_01]: A neat way to transform the Tamagotchi and Pokemon concept into something that will be very accessible to a lot of people.

145
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:13,125
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it is going to be a very successful game.

146
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:21,104
[SPEAKER_01]: My only beef with it is that the actual game elements of it, outside of training your dog, turned out to be kind of thin.

147
00:10:21,624 --> 00:10:31,090
[SPEAKER_01]: Granted, you have these trial competitions that you can do, the agility trial, where you teach your dog how to jump over hurdles and run through tubes and stuff.

148
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:35,272
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the obedience competition, which is kind of boring, you just yell voice commands at your dog.

149
00:10:36,013 --> 00:10:40,255
[SPEAKER_01]: And a frisbee competition, I don't remember the exact name of it, but there's a frisbee competition as well.

150
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:49,017
[SPEAKER_01]: Sort of wears a little bit thin, especially the fact that you have to sit through these two announcers who talk very slowly and have really lame jokes and stuff.

151
00:10:50,177 --> 00:10:53,918
[SPEAKER_01]: I was also a little bit disappointed that you couldn't do more with the head-to-head aspect.

152
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:56,199
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you couldn't go head-to-head in an agility trial.

153
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:59,100
[SPEAKER_01]: At least, if you can, I haven't found this out yet or anything.

154
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:04,262
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I was a little disappointed that all you can really do is exchange and play with each other's dogs.

155
00:11:04,542 --> 00:11:08,483
[SPEAKER_01]: Although that is a really neat concept, I would have liked to have seen something maybe a little more competitive.

156
00:11:08,939 --> 00:11:13,361
[SPEAKER_02]: You can, like, I guess because each game has certain items that are in each one.

157
00:11:13,421 --> 00:11:13,641
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

158
00:11:14,142 --> 00:11:16,903
[SPEAKER_02]: So in order to get all the items, you have to have all the games.

159
00:11:16,923 --> 00:11:17,343
[SPEAKER_01]: Trade.

160
00:11:17,383 --> 00:11:20,045
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess maybe it's more of a friendly competition.

161
00:11:20,065 --> 00:11:22,146
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a co-op game instead of a competitive game.

162
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:28,369
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have liked to have seen maybe more ways that you could have pitted dogs up against each other to see who the better trainer is.

163
00:11:29,269 --> 00:11:31,610
[SPEAKER_01]: But I still think it's a very solid game.

164
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:32,471
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a very...

165
00:11:33,069 --> 00:11:34,910
[SPEAKER_01]: A holiday edition has been trademarked.

166
00:11:55,091 --> 00:11:58,313
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't know if that's going to be something that actually happens, but who knows.

167
00:11:58,594 --> 00:12:05,118
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to talk about DS expansions in one of our stories tonight, because it's very interesting the way they're expanding some of the DS games.

168
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:11,623
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than Nintendogs, I really didn't play a whole lot of new stuff, just Final Fantasy XI.

169
00:12:11,683 --> 00:12:16,046
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize, Loki, I didn't get to the copy of Hello Kitty Roller Rescue that you gave me last week.

170
00:12:16,426 --> 00:12:21,730
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't had a chance to hook up the GameCube, so I'm trying to look for a better cable for it.

171
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,991
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to get at least an S video for my high-def TV.

172
00:12:24,011 --> 00:12:24,732
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

173
00:12:26,051 --> 00:12:26,932
[SPEAKER_01]: and Halo 2.

174
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:31,057
[SPEAKER_01]: Last night I went over to a friend's birthday party and it was just a bunch of guys playing Halo 2.

175
00:12:31,838 --> 00:12:37,125
[SPEAKER_01]: And somehow we got the idea that we'd get our friend who doesn't really play a lot of video games but really likes to talk shit.

176
00:12:37,485 --> 00:12:44,174
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd get him really drunk and he just got online and my friend who's really good at Halo, you know he's like a level 20 something and all the head to head stuff.

177
00:12:44,594 --> 00:12:47,495
[SPEAKER_01]: We got him to actually control and my friend to wear the headset.

178
00:12:47,855 --> 00:12:49,835
[SPEAKER_01]: So he just made fun of people the whole night.

179
00:12:49,995 --> 00:12:51,536
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, made fun of people's names.

180
00:12:51,856 --> 00:12:53,696
[SPEAKER_01]: He was making fun of people on the same team and stuff.

181
00:12:54,057 --> 00:12:55,557
[SPEAKER_01]: Highly immature stuff.

182
00:12:55,997 --> 00:12:57,377
[SPEAKER_01]: Highly, highly amusing.

183
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:03,579
[SPEAKER_01]: It was so funny because there was this girl who ended up getting more kills than my friend in one match.

184
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:07,980
[SPEAKER_01]: Either it was a girl or a little boy who hadn't gone through puberty yet.

185
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,141
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the boys are really kind of like this.

186
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:10,741
[SPEAKER_01]: And the person was going...

187
00:13:11,951 --> 00:13:16,632
[SPEAKER_01]: and just doing this dance in their living room or something and yelling at us on Xbox Live.

188
00:13:17,452 --> 00:13:20,913
[SPEAKER_01]: The joys of Xbox Live and talking smack.

189
00:13:24,494 --> 00:13:26,754
[SPEAKER_01]: Not so much fun if you're on the receiving end, though, I bet.

190
00:13:28,114 --> 00:13:30,715
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, let's get to that story about the expansion pack, actually.

191
00:13:30,755 --> 00:13:31,955
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll start off with this story tonight.

192
00:13:31,975 --> 00:13:36,476
[SPEAKER_01]: This is actually a game we've talked a little bit about on the show, but I don't know of a U.S.

193
00:13:36,536 --> 00:13:37,436
[SPEAKER_01]: release of this game yet.

194
00:13:37,476 --> 00:13:39,917
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually a Japanese game called Jam with the Band.

195
00:13:39,937 --> 00:13:40,597
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh-huh.

196
00:13:41,058 --> 00:13:45,780
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's kind of one of those ones where you play the instruments on your DS and interactive title.

197
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:50,782
[SPEAKER_01]: This hasn't come out in the US yet, but what is coming out in Japan, apparently the game has been very successful in Japan.

198
00:13:51,222 --> 00:13:53,583
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're going to be releasing an expansion pack.

199
00:13:54,286 --> 00:13:56,788
[SPEAKER_01]: But you have to have the DS game to be able to use the expansion pack.

200
00:13:57,048 --> 00:14:02,951
[SPEAKER_01]: The way the expansion pack works, it's a Game Boy Advance cartridge that plugs into the bottom slot of your DS.

201
00:14:03,511 --> 00:14:07,134
[SPEAKER_01]: And so 20 songs are loaded into the DS cartridge.

202
00:14:08,094 --> 00:14:11,356
[SPEAKER_01]: Songs that I don't recognize a whole lot of these songs.

203
00:14:11,396 --> 00:14:14,798
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of them are Japanese titles, except for one of them.

204
00:14:15,558 --> 00:14:17,920
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the Numa Numae song is on here, the, you know...

205
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,701
[SPEAKER_01]: Dragostun, Tay, or whatever it's called.

206
00:14:19,761 --> 00:14:23,265
[SPEAKER_01]: That's in the expansion pack for Jam of the Band, along with some Nintendo favorites.

207
00:14:23,325 --> 00:14:27,288
[SPEAKER_01]: Star Fox 64, Super Mario 64 DS are all in this expansion pack.

208
00:14:27,308 --> 00:14:32,773
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that's very... What's neat about this story, not so much the game, but the method of delivering the expansion.

209
00:14:33,874 --> 00:14:35,075
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cool that you mentioned that.

210
00:14:35,555 --> 00:14:38,338
[SPEAKER_02]: There's another game that's coming out similar to that.

211
00:14:38,758 --> 00:14:40,560
[SPEAKER_02]: Metroid Prime Pinball.

212
00:14:42,318 --> 00:14:42,698
[SPEAKER_02]: and DarkSakura.

213
00:14:57,412 --> 00:15:01,153
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew there was more to that advanced slot than just Game Boy Advance games.

214
00:15:01,173 --> 00:15:06,015
[SPEAKER_01]: If you think about it, this goes all the way back to Field of Magic XXY or whatever it is.

215
00:15:06,435 --> 00:15:15,778
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the launch titles where Secret Trick, if you put in I think it's Sonic Adventure 2 in your GBA slot, you unlock a Sonic costume on the DS cartridge.

216
00:15:16,098 --> 00:15:21,139
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've known forever the DS has this capability to interact with whatever game is in the bottom slot.

217
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:23,560
[SPEAKER_01]: So if a Nintendogs

218
00:15:24,226 --> 00:15:40,099
[SPEAKER_01]: So hypothetically, if there is this holiday edition and an expansion pack is delivered, I'd bet you either it's going to be its own standalone cartridge where they try to get you to buy the same game over again because you can get cute Santa hats for your puppy, or it's going to be an expansion pack, which I think would be very cool.

219
00:15:40,459 --> 00:15:47,084
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine that, an expansion pack that plugs in the advance that would work with all three titles and maybe unlock a particular breed of dog in no matter what game you own.

220
00:15:47,104 --> 00:15:47,945
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be cool.

221
00:15:49,366 --> 00:15:49,927
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see, though.

222
00:15:49,967 --> 00:15:50,247
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see.

223
00:15:51,777 --> 00:15:54,578
[SPEAKER_01]: Also in the news tonight, I was talking about Halo a little bit ago.

224
00:15:54,598 --> 00:16:03,080
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, you guys probably heard that Halo is going to be turned into a movie projected to be about 2007 for this movie to come out.

225
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:06,181
[SPEAKER_01]: Fox and Universal were the ones that teamed up to create this movie.

226
00:16:06,821 --> 00:16:12,442
[SPEAKER_01]: The script, as I understand, is being written by the guy who did 28 Days Later, Alex Garland.

227
00:16:12,882 --> 00:16:14,523
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, he also did The Beach.

228
00:16:14,983 --> 00:16:15,163
[SPEAKER_01]: So...

229
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:18,312
[SPEAKER_01]: Could be hit or miss.

230
00:16:18,733 --> 00:16:19,235
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll see.

231
00:16:19,315 --> 00:16:19,696
[SPEAKER_01]: More news.

232
00:16:19,776 --> 00:16:23,748
[SPEAKER_01]: No stars attached yet, but I'm sure all of that will develop a little bit later on.

233
00:16:24,634 --> 00:16:25,955
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I want to say about Halo.

234
00:16:26,515 --> 00:16:27,976
[SPEAKER_01]: This, I think, is very interesting.

235
00:16:27,996 --> 00:16:31,178
[SPEAKER_01]: There's going to be a Halo triple pack coming out before the end of the year.

236
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:33,019
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's coming out in October.

237
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:37,522
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be $60, or as they say, $59.99, but I say that's just $60.

238
00:16:38,243 --> 00:16:43,005
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be Halo, Halo 2, and the Halo 2 multiplayer map pack.

239
00:16:43,466 --> 00:16:46,768
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, usually if you bought these games together, it would cost you about $80.

240
00:16:47,148 --> 00:16:50,090
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of like you're getting a combo, burgers, fries, and soda, right?

241
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:51,711
[SPEAKER_01]: But my question is...

242
00:16:53,363 --> 00:16:59,624
[SPEAKER_01]: Who that owns an Xbox, who is this aimed at?

243
00:16:59,684 --> 00:17:05,946
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you own an Xbox, you have to own one of these games unless you're not a first person shooter type.

244
00:17:06,406 --> 00:17:08,606
[SPEAKER_01]: But if that's the case, I don't know why you own an Xbox.

245
00:17:09,967 --> 00:17:15,488
[SPEAKER_01]: No, all kidding aside though, there's sports titles, Ninja Gaiden, there's other Xbox titles that are good.

246
00:17:16,155 --> 00:17:17,156
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

247
00:17:38,661 --> 00:17:40,642
[SPEAKER_01]: at least the Halos will be backwards compatible.

248
00:17:40,682 --> 00:17:47,506
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going to be a good way to get people, you know, to catch up on Halo who might be joining Microsoft with the Xbox 360 and didn't have an Xbox.

249
00:17:47,867 --> 00:17:53,330
[SPEAKER_01]: But my thought along with that is, who's going to buy an Xbox 360 that isn't already an Xbox fan?

250
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:53,810
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

251
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:54,671
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how many people.

252
00:17:54,751 --> 00:17:55,851
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't own an Xbox, right?

253
00:17:56,052 --> 00:17:56,212
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

254
00:17:56,472 --> 00:17:57,332
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going to buy an Xbox 360?

255
00:17:58,153 --> 00:17:59,874
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably just because it's a next-gen system.

256
00:17:59,894 --> 00:18:04,797
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, then you're the only person I've talked to that would plan to be buying an Xbox 360.

257
00:18:04,977 --> 00:18:06,718
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess there could be other folks out there, but I just...

258
00:18:08,779 --> 00:18:10,200
[SPEAKER_02]: Really, I'm not buying it for Halo.

259
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:13,263
[SPEAKER_02]: If Halo comes out for it, I'm not going to buy it.

260
00:18:13,423 --> 00:18:15,504
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you buying it for Final Fantasy XI Pretty Edition?

261
00:18:15,564 --> 00:18:16,145
[SPEAKER_02]: No, hell no.

262
00:18:16,245 --> 00:18:17,125
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not buying it for that.

263
00:18:17,145 --> 00:18:18,506
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm buying it for Project Gotham Racing 3.

264
00:18:18,807 --> 00:18:19,667
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'm buying it for.

265
00:18:19,687 --> 00:18:21,028
[SPEAKER_02]: That and Ridge Racer 6.

266
00:18:21,128 --> 00:18:21,769
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell yeah.

267
00:18:21,989 --> 00:18:23,410
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all about the racing games.

268
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:31,756
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, well then I guess I stand corrected because feasibly, with this lower price, they could taunt someone like you into buying this, although you're not a Halo fan.

269
00:18:31,896 --> 00:18:35,539
[SPEAKER_02]: I would not buy the stupid Halo expansion pack and that crap.

270
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:36,899
[SPEAKER_02]: But you're not a Halo fan, either.

271
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:42,362
[SPEAKER_02]: If you think about it, though, Halo 2 is probably going to drop in price here pretty quick anyways to about $20, and then it'll be just $60 anyways.

272
00:18:42,382 --> 00:18:43,282
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I disagree.

273
00:18:43,342 --> 00:18:45,643
[SPEAKER_01]: Halo, they're still asking $29.99 for Halo 1.

274
00:18:45,803 --> 00:18:46,944
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's not.

275
00:18:46,964 --> 00:18:47,464
[SPEAKER_01]: It's dropped down to $20.

276
00:18:47,564 --> 00:18:49,525
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw it somewhere for $29.99.

277
00:18:50,165 --> 00:18:50,866
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, no.

278
00:18:51,846 --> 00:18:52,466
[SPEAKER_02]: But whatever.

279
00:18:52,566 --> 00:18:53,727
[SPEAKER_01]: Mine came with my Xbox.

280
00:18:53,747 --> 00:18:55,908
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a pretty green Xbox, so I didn't have to worry about it.

281
00:18:56,008 --> 00:18:56,648
[SPEAKER_01]: Mine came with mine.

282
00:18:56,668 --> 00:18:58,409
[SPEAKER_02]: Except I thought Halo was part of that, you know...

283
00:18:59,076 --> 00:19:01,560
[SPEAKER_02]: The Best Hits or whatever they call them, Platinum.

284
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,501
[SPEAKER_01]: It is and it isn't.

285
00:19:02,781 --> 00:19:07,928
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's the best selling Xbox game of all time, but they can still get away with charging $30 for it.

286
00:19:07,948 --> 00:19:16,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know, see everything in this collection of ours is supposed to be $17.99, but we just want some more money for it.

287
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:17,006
[SPEAKER_01]: XBOX 360

288
00:19:34,151 --> 00:19:39,636
[SPEAKER_01]: has created a pack and they're calling this the ultimate Xbox 360 pack.

289
00:19:40,056 --> 00:19:56,592
[SPEAKER_01]: It comes with a system, Perfect Dark Zero, Project Gotham Racing 3, Elder Scrolls 4, Dead or Alive 4, Call of Duty 2, Gun, Quake 4, Tony Hawk, Condemned, Madden NFL 06, Cameo, Wireless Controller, Play and Charge Kit, Rechargeable Battery, 12-Month Card,

290
00:19:56,932 --> 00:19:59,473
[SPEAKER_01]: for Xbox Live one-year product replacement plan.

291
00:19:59,754 --> 00:20:02,135
[SPEAKER_01]: And it'll only set you back $1,199.83.

292
00:20:02,955 --> 00:20:07,438
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, boys and girls, that was $1,199.

293
00:20:07,478 --> 00:20:11,720
[SPEAKER_01]: Not even... So go lie down your $5 now and reserve that.

294
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:12,581
[SPEAKER_02]: This is retarded.

295
00:20:12,601 --> 00:20:12,581
$50.

296
00:20:12,621 --> 00:20:12,841
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, is it $50?

297
00:20:12,881 --> 00:20:14,401
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right, it's $50 for a system, huh?

298
00:20:14,642 --> 00:20:15,162
[SPEAKER_02]: Retarded.

299
00:20:16,303 --> 00:20:17,463
[SPEAKER_02]: Who would buy that crap?

300
00:20:17,523 --> 00:20:18,143
[SPEAKER_02]: Rich people?

301
00:20:18,544 --> 00:20:22,486
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, seriously, though, you probably could go shop it and get it for a lot cheaper anyways.

302
00:20:23,206 --> 00:20:23,967
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't know.

303
00:20:23,987 --> 00:20:24,287
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.

304
00:20:24,307 --> 00:20:24,567
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.

305
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:26,155
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

306
00:20:52,534 --> 00:20:52,834
[SPEAKER_01]: DualSystems

307
00:21:08,021 --> 00:21:13,365
[SPEAKER_01]: Our email address, togo, T-O-G-O, at orangeloungeradio.com We'd like to hear from you.

308
00:21:13,425 --> 00:21:17,068
[SPEAKER_01]: It helps inflate our egos a little bit to know that there's folks out there listening.

309
00:21:17,268 --> 00:21:17,429
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

310
00:21:17,649 --> 00:21:20,151
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we'd like to hear from you guys and comment on the show and stuff.

311
00:21:20,771 --> 00:21:28,397
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, because Dark Sakura is out tonight and she's kind of the queen of our mailbox, I only have one letter tonight because it was something that was actually sent directly to me.

312
00:21:28,477 --> 00:21:30,019
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody actually sent me an email directly.

313
00:21:30,379 --> 00:21:30,999
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's cool.

314
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,501
[SPEAKER_01]: At least it gives me something to read tonight.

315
00:21:32,661 --> 00:21:32,801
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

316
00:21:33,001 --> 00:21:34,582
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought it was a good email, so we're going to read this.

317
00:21:35,283 --> 00:21:36,404
[SPEAKER_01]: This comes to us from Flynn.

318
00:21:37,205 --> 00:21:41,930
[SPEAKER_01]: Flynn says, hello, I've just heard my first podcast of your show, courtesy of my PSP.

319
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:50,498
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's very interesting that he's downloading the show on the PSP, because if you're a PSP owner, we're going to do something for you guys.

320
00:21:50,598 --> 00:21:53,000
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're not talking about it just yet.

321
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:53,641
[SPEAKER_01]: We're working on it.

322
00:21:54,301 --> 00:21:55,262
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully within the month.

323
00:21:55,563 --> 00:21:58,065
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, by the way, I forgot to mention this earlier this week.

324
00:21:58,345 --> 00:21:59,526
[SPEAKER_02]: I bought another PSP.

325
00:21:59,927 --> 00:22:01,148
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have two PSPs now.

326
00:22:01,188 --> 00:22:01,488
[SPEAKER_02]: Sucker.

327
00:22:01,809 --> 00:22:02,269
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, anyway.

328
00:22:02,748 --> 00:22:04,750
[SPEAKER_01]: So hello to those of you listening on your PSPs.

329
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:07,231
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to do something for you guys pretty soon.

330
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:20,401
[SPEAKER_01]: Flynn wanted to comment on what a listener named Rob had to say about virtual ethics in regards to the Chinese exchange student using a bot to mug other players in Lineage 2 and sell their virtual loot for real cash.

331
00:22:21,262 --> 00:22:27,667
[SPEAKER_01]: Rob went on to say that virtual ethics or ethics in not a real place are inconsequential.

332
00:22:27,987 --> 00:22:28,908
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't talk tonight.

333
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:30,764
[SPEAKER_01]: Too many syllables in that word.

334
00:22:30,804 --> 00:22:34,045
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thinking about that Xbox DS and I'm seeing dollar signs all over.

335
00:22:34,065 --> 00:22:38,847
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, Flynn says, there's a famous saying, ethics is what you do in the dark when no one's watching.

336
00:22:39,147 --> 00:22:42,488
[SPEAKER_01]: I can think of no darker a place than cyberspace where no one can watch.

337
00:22:42,848 --> 00:22:46,049
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you empty the contents of a lost wallet if no one knew you had it?

338
00:22:46,209 --> 00:22:51,470
[SPEAKER_01]: Or would you track down the owner to return the wallet knowing no reward would be given and they would never find you if you did not?

339
00:22:52,088 --> 00:23:02,357
[SPEAKER_01]: Having never played Lineage 2, I can only assume that mugging and player killing are part of the many wonderful experiences you can participate in during the game, and that the student had not hacked the program in order to create these things.

340
00:23:03,228 --> 00:23:04,469
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually tried to do a little research.

341
00:23:04,589 --> 00:23:05,369
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let me finish this letter.

342
00:23:06,991 --> 00:23:12,174
[SPEAKER_01]: I have also heard of people creating things in the virtual world to auction off for real cash, and as far as I know, this is not illegal.

343
00:23:12,574 --> 00:23:19,199
[SPEAKER_01]: That being said, mugging and PKing and selling virtual loot in the real world should not have led to an arrest, in my opinion.

344
00:23:19,479 --> 00:23:22,001
[SPEAKER_01]: The only crime was maybe the creation of the bot program.

345
00:23:22,281 --> 00:23:25,923
[SPEAKER_01]: However, everyone should be crystal clear in that his actions were unethical.

346
00:23:26,203 --> 00:23:32,448
[SPEAKER_01]: Do not believe for one second that you are a good, upstanding citizen in the real world while treating people like garbage in the virtual world.

347
00:23:32,628 --> 00:23:33,088
[SPEAKER_01]: Very good point.

348
00:23:33,629 --> 00:23:39,541
[SPEAKER_01]: doing awful things while hiding behind a screen name or handle is just revealing your true nature in the dark that comes to us from Flynn

349
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:41,097
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the email, Flynn.

350
00:23:41,197 --> 00:23:46,181
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually tried to do a little research as to whether Lineage 2 has that mugging feature built in.

351
00:23:46,501 --> 00:23:50,264
[SPEAKER_01]: So I went to Google, you know, like Lineage 2 mugging, and of course I just got a bunch of articles.

352
00:23:50,304 --> 00:23:55,148
[SPEAKER_01]: But I tried reading some, doing a little research, trying to see if mugging is something that's built into the game.

353
00:23:55,529 --> 00:24:04,216
[SPEAKER_01]: It's my understanding that although it sounds like PK is something that's built into the game, what this person did is the person wrote a bot program to automate

354
00:24:04,796 --> 00:24:06,057
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing all of these quests.

355
00:24:06,217 --> 00:24:09,818
[SPEAKER_01]: And doing things faster than a human can possibly do them.

356
00:24:10,198 --> 00:24:12,039
[SPEAKER_01]: So the bot would always win.

357
00:24:12,399 --> 00:24:13,860
[SPEAKER_01]: No matter what, the bot would win.

358
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,701
[SPEAKER_01]: And the bot was basically unkillable.

359
00:24:16,221 --> 00:24:20,643
[SPEAKER_01]: So, in a way, he kind of, I guess, brought an exploit to light?

360
00:24:20,763 --> 00:24:21,643
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what you'd call it.

361
00:24:22,203 --> 00:24:24,324
[SPEAKER_01]: But I definitely agree with Flynn that it was unethical.

362
00:24:24,364 --> 00:24:27,165
[SPEAKER_01]: But Flynn says maybe they went a little far in arresting the guy.

363
00:24:27,726 --> 00:24:32,708
[SPEAKER_01]: So, your thoughts are welcome to go at OrangeLoungeRadio.com I don't know about unethical.

364
00:24:32,748 --> 00:24:33,188
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, because...

365
00:24:33,809 --> 00:24:40,174
[SPEAKER_02]: One could say if you create a better way of doing something that's unethical, but I call it, you know, innovative.

366
00:24:40,194 --> 00:24:40,895
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, you know what, though?

367
00:24:40,915 --> 00:24:41,395
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what, though?

368
00:24:41,415 --> 00:24:41,996
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a difference.

369
00:24:42,016 --> 00:24:45,238
[SPEAKER_01]: You're talking about cheating in Burnout 3 in single-player mode, right?

370
00:24:45,418 --> 00:24:46,980
[SPEAKER_01]: What you were doing earlier this week?

371
00:24:48,501 --> 00:24:49,622
[SPEAKER_01]: I downloaded a save.

372
00:24:50,462 --> 00:24:52,824
[SPEAKER_01]: That's different, because you're only affecting your game.

373
00:24:52,984 --> 00:25:01,311
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to go on to Moviespoilers.com or whatever that site is, and you want to read the end to every movie that's out there, go for it.

374
00:25:02,421 --> 00:25:02,962
[SPEAKER_01]: Have fun.

375
00:25:03,302 --> 00:25:04,624
[SPEAKER_01]: Spoil the movies for yourselves.

376
00:25:04,764 --> 00:25:05,325
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a blast.

377
00:25:06,085 --> 00:25:10,751
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you go and tell all your friends about the spoilers, somebody's going to get pissed off at you about it.

378
00:25:11,152 --> 00:25:12,033
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's kind of similar.

379
00:25:12,233 --> 00:25:15,897
[SPEAKER_01]: You can ruin the game for yourself if you want, but ruining the game for others is crossing the line.

380
00:25:16,058 --> 00:25:17,059
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of the way I look at it.

381
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:18,040
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

382
00:25:18,629 --> 00:25:19,509
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

383
00:25:36,238 --> 00:25:43,163
[SPEAKER_01]: Apparently these guys were hooking up the Xbox to their computer somehow so that they would always be the server.

384
00:25:43,423 --> 00:25:48,606
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they're the server, they can cause the other players to lag out and basically kill them while they can't move.

385
00:25:49,107 --> 00:25:50,187
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was watching this happening.

386
00:25:50,227 --> 00:25:53,590
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure enough, every couple minutes, lag, lag, lag, my friends are dead.

387
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:54,950
[SPEAKER_01]: Lag, lag, lag, my friends are dead.

388
00:25:55,171 --> 00:25:56,772
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody was bitching and complaining about this.

389
00:25:56,812 --> 00:26:00,074
[SPEAKER_01]: So somebody was doing this and the person had way many kills.

390
00:26:00,654 --> 00:26:02,916
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I mean...

391
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,502
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

392
00:26:17,091 --> 00:26:25,698
[SPEAKER_01]: Seriously, I realize we do an internet radio show where we talk about video games, but we try to talk about balance between that and having a personal life.

393
00:26:25,758 --> 00:26:29,742
[SPEAKER_01]: So please kids, stop cheating on Halo 2 to make your internet penis feel bigger.

394
00:26:30,342 --> 00:26:37,388
[SPEAKER_01]: Go out and get laid, because I'll tell you what, an orgasm feels 10,000 times better than owning some noob in Halo 2, at least in my opinion.

395
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:40,711
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you feel differently, I don't know.

396
00:26:43,649 --> 00:26:45,591
[SPEAKER_01]: Follow-up to a previous story we talked about.

397
00:26:46,412 --> 00:26:50,557
[SPEAKER_01]: You know how we said that the firmware was going to be upgraded on the Sony PSP like two weeks ago?

398
00:26:50,737 --> 00:26:52,319
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they were a little bit late.

399
00:26:52,759 --> 00:26:53,680
[SPEAKER_01]: Finally came out.

400
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:54,781
[SPEAKER_01]: It was finally released.

401
00:26:55,542 --> 00:26:59,046
[SPEAKER_01]: It came out this past week, and now it's available on Sony's site.

402
00:26:59,066 --> 00:27:02,790
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you are interested in upgrading your firmware to 2.0, you can go ahead and do that.

403
00:27:03,331 --> 00:27:04,112
[SPEAKER_01]: What you're going to get?

404
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,080
[SPEAKER_01]: New web browser application.

405
00:27:06,681 --> 00:27:08,501
[SPEAKER_01]: And it also has a tabbing feature.

406
00:27:08,521 --> 00:27:12,122
[SPEAKER_01]: You can have three tabs of browser windows open at once, which is kind of neat.

407
00:27:13,102 --> 00:27:18,503
[SPEAKER_01]: Other additions include 4-3 ratio, so you can watch TV programs, 4-3 screen mode.

408
00:27:19,283 --> 00:27:22,564
[SPEAKER_01]: AAC and WAV audio files are also added.

409
00:27:22,944 --> 00:27:25,445
[SPEAKER_01]: Check out the PlayStation site if you want more details.

410
00:27:26,065 --> 00:27:34,489
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to check out, because I checked out on Loki's new PSP, he upgraded it to 2.0, I checked out the web browser, and of course I'm loading OrangeLaunchRadio.com on the web browser, looking at it, and ooh, pretty.

411
00:27:36,591 --> 00:27:37,791
[SPEAKER_02]: Neat, I guess, neat.

412
00:27:37,891 --> 00:27:40,673
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot faster than the Wipeout browser, I'll give them that.

413
00:27:40,933 --> 00:27:43,654
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for sure, it's a lot faster than that.

414
00:27:44,214 --> 00:27:50,958
[SPEAKER_02]: And browsing's pretty easy, I don't like the stupid little text input that they have, but they're releasing keyboard for it, so...

415
00:27:51,271 --> 00:27:53,652
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's like a cell phone where you have to keep tapping one button.

416
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:56,613
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to be releasing a keyboard, so whatever.

417
00:27:56,673 --> 00:28:05,157
[SPEAKER_02]: But they actually did improve their method of entering stuff in because you can see how many times you've got to tab the button to get to your next letter.

418
00:28:05,237 --> 00:28:07,138
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's not that hard.

419
00:28:07,198 --> 00:28:10,219
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's not going to be good for chatting or anything.

420
00:28:10,299 --> 00:28:20,304
[SPEAKER_02]: But even some of the IRC programs that they've made for it, like the one website, PSP IRC or something like that, they have a Java keyboard anyway, so you don't really need it.

421
00:28:20,764 --> 00:28:20,904
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

422
00:28:21,598 --> 00:28:22,599
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

423
00:28:41,904 --> 00:28:43,105
[SPEAKER_02]: for their PSP launch.

424
00:28:43,165 --> 00:28:44,846
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called YourPSP.com.

425
00:28:45,506 --> 00:28:49,289
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're going to have movie trailers, downloadable games, and stuff like that.

426
00:28:49,509 --> 00:28:51,290
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'll be interested when that happens.

427
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:56,153
[SPEAKER_01]: And you could, essentially, if they're going to implement Flash, then you would be able to download Strong Bad.

428
00:28:56,893 --> 00:28:57,213
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?

429
00:28:57,253 --> 00:28:59,555
[SPEAKER_01]: You could listen to that on your PSP, right?

430
00:28:59,695 --> 00:29:01,496
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I guess you could.

431
00:29:02,637 --> 00:29:06,699
[SPEAKER_02]: So, dude, we really need Strong Bad to burninate your PSP.

432
00:29:06,879 --> 00:29:09,201
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, a lot of the kids out there would like that.

433
00:29:09,281 --> 00:29:09,761
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

434
00:29:10,834 --> 00:29:11,794
[SPEAKER_01]: I like Strong Bad, he's funny.

435
00:29:13,655 --> 00:29:15,056
[SPEAKER_01]: Moving on, what do you got for us tonight, Loki?

436
00:29:15,176 --> 00:29:18,318
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we got a couple things, a couple things in the rumor mills.

437
00:29:19,098 --> 00:29:26,602
[SPEAKER_02]: First off, starting that, IGN did this nice little look at the Game Boy Micro, which is coming out in September here in a couple weeks.

438
00:29:27,242 --> 00:29:32,485
[SPEAKER_02]: They did a bunch of size comparisons, and I can say that it's about the size of a stick of gum.

439
00:29:34,305 --> 00:29:36,767
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they have a winter fresh gum thing next to it.

440
00:29:36,847 --> 00:29:39,448
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks more like the size of the guy's cell phone in the picture you have there.

441
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:41,571
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a small Game Boy Advance.

442
00:29:41,591 --> 00:29:43,593
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you really want to buy it again, go for it.

443
00:29:43,713 --> 00:29:45,234
[SPEAKER_02]: But, I don't know.

444
00:29:45,895 --> 00:29:47,436
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see the point of buying this thing.

445
00:29:47,976 --> 00:29:52,439
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people out there might like the accessory-ness of this.

446
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,120
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

447
00:29:53,400 --> 00:30:00,065
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the people that buy this thing and like the fact that you can change the face plates are the people that buy the stupid Game Boy Advances when they come out in different colors.

448
00:30:00,906 --> 00:30:01,406
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we really?

449
00:30:01,426 --> 00:30:02,107
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, no.

450
00:30:04,068 --> 00:30:04,949
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm not buying that.

451
00:30:05,089 --> 00:30:05,369
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways.

452
00:30:06,714 --> 00:30:15,101
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the other thing was, is they had some info on, um, what they think is going to be revolutionary about the, um, Nintendo Revolution.

453
00:30:15,581 --> 00:30:21,966
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, granted, we're going to know in a few weeks what is revolutionary about it, because on the 16th, Nintendo's actually holding a press conference.

454
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:23,687
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to let all the cats out of the bag.

455
00:30:23,707 --> 00:30:24,608
[SPEAKER_02]: About time.

456
00:30:25,048 --> 00:30:27,410
[SPEAKER_02]: So, everything's going to be known about the Revolution.

457
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:31,012
[SPEAKER_02]: But, in the meantime, we could speculate to, you know, the cows.

458
00:30:31,092 --> 00:30:32,413
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, speculate away.

459
00:30:32,433 --> 00:30:35,576
[SPEAKER_02]: So, this speculation is supposedly by this guy, um,

460
00:30:36,278 --> 00:30:40,459
[SPEAKER_02]: Sponge, or whatever he claims to know what's going on.

461
00:30:40,499 --> 00:30:49,182
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically, he's said that there's going to be, it's going to make it so where that it's hard to turn the controller, like tilt the controller.

462
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:59,945
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to have gyroscopes in it, so it's going to be kind of like, almost like a rumble pack, but it's going to make it so that it feels like, for example, you're drifting around a corner, it'll give you G-forces, you know, going one direction or something.

463
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:03,666
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how that's going to work, but that's an interesting idea, because it'll be

464
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:09,155
[SPEAKER_02]: Revolutionary in the fact that this hasn't been done, and the fact that gyroscopes spin revolutionary.

465
00:31:10,597 --> 00:31:12,018
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, cute, cute.

466
00:31:12,398 --> 00:31:14,621
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a theory, but I don't know.

467
00:31:14,721 --> 00:31:25,311
[SPEAKER_02]: My personal thing is I think it's going to be that, and I think if you've seen those keyboards out there that have the little LCD buttons on them, where they can change what the button looks like, I think that's going to be the other thing.

468
00:31:26,292 --> 00:31:27,033
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's two things.

469
00:31:27,989 --> 00:31:28,830
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

470
00:31:29,251 --> 00:31:30,332
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm totally speculating too.

471
00:31:30,452 --> 00:31:32,355
[SPEAKER_01]: But we'll know in a couple weeks on the 16th.

472
00:31:32,575 --> 00:31:35,580
[SPEAKER_01]: All the speculation comes back to the controller, which I think is interesting.

473
00:31:36,403 --> 00:31:41,547
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and they said that that would be revolutionary, I'd imagine, but I don't know if it's revolutionary enough to sell the system.

474
00:31:41,567 --> 00:31:48,491
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what though, you're also assuming though, when you're saying that it's a play on the name, that the actual name of the system is going to be the revolution.

475
00:31:48,511 --> 00:31:50,192
[SPEAKER_01]: This is still a working title, correct?

476
00:31:50,212 --> 00:31:50,493
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

477
00:31:50,513 --> 00:31:53,775
[SPEAKER_01]: They have not confirmed that this will be the actual name of the system.

478
00:31:54,035 --> 00:31:57,497
[SPEAKER_01]: And for the longest time, GameCube was what, Dolphin, I think they were calling it?

479
00:31:57,718 --> 00:31:58,238
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

480
00:31:58,258 --> 00:31:58,598
[SPEAKER_01]: Or was that the 64?

481
00:31:58,678 --> 00:31:59,839
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, one or the other.

482
00:31:59,859 --> 00:32:00,439
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them, yeah.

483
00:32:00,459 --> 00:32:00,840
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

484
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,100
[SPEAKER_01]: And they changed the name before it was released.

485
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:05,381
[SPEAKER_01]: So this may not actually be the Nintendo Revolution.

486
00:32:05,421 --> 00:32:07,181
[SPEAKER_01]: We may get a new name coming up.

487
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:09,842
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, just like the Xbox 360.

488
00:32:10,022 --> 00:32:10,962
[SPEAKER_02]: What the hell was that?

489
00:32:11,042 --> 00:32:11,302
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, 360?

490
00:32:11,662 --> 00:32:13,963
[SPEAKER_02]: That's retarded.

491
00:32:14,843 --> 00:32:15,763
[SPEAKER_02]: Xbox 2.

492
00:32:16,163 --> 00:32:17,164
[SPEAKER_02]: Xbox 360.

493
00:32:17,924 --> 00:32:18,304
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is it the 360?

494
00:32:18,344 --> 00:32:23,385
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we're going back around and doing the same thing all over again?

495
00:32:23,465 --> 00:32:23,865
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

496
00:32:25,926 --> 00:32:26,806
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyways, there's that.

497
00:32:27,325 --> 00:32:33,347
[SPEAKER_02]: And speaking of the 360, and I mentioned this a couple weeks ago about the Origin 360 site.

498
00:32:33,788 --> 00:32:35,908
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's changing.

499
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:39,450
[SPEAKER_02]: The site is changing, and there's more stuff happening.

500
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:49,654
[SPEAKER_02]: Before, for those who might not remember, the Origin site had a picture of a tree with a countdown to sometime in September, and there was a bunny rabbit.

501
00:32:49,794 --> 00:32:49,874
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

502
00:32:49,894 --> 00:32:50,054
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

503
00:32:50,492 --> 00:32:54,835
[SPEAKER_02]: BunnyRabbits moved to the other side of the screen, the hole's getting bigger in the bottom of the tree, and there's apples growing.

504
00:32:54,955 --> 00:33:03,040
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the apples is a symbol for the Windows Messenger, which is interesting.

505
00:33:04,001 --> 00:33:07,884
[SPEAKER_01]: So, integration with Windows Messaging for Xbox 360, maybe?

506
00:33:07,904 --> 00:33:12,647
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, come on, this is a Microsoft product, of course they're going to have that.

507
00:33:14,034 --> 00:33:15,395
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't jump to conclusions.

508
00:33:16,576 --> 00:33:17,836
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just another viral site.

509
00:33:17,856 --> 00:33:25,900
[SPEAKER_02]: If you really want to check it out, originxbox360.com That's O-R-I-G-E-N xbox360.com Go look at the pretty bunny.

510
00:33:28,041 --> 00:33:31,242
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess something's going to happen with the bunny.

511
00:33:32,303 --> 00:33:33,584
[SPEAKER_02]: The controller will be a bunny.

512
00:33:33,984 --> 00:33:35,204
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the bunny should be a mascot.

513
00:33:35,545 --> 00:33:36,605
[SPEAKER_02]: We need a good bunny mascot.

514
00:33:37,225 --> 00:33:37,966
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a cardboard bunny.

515
00:33:37,986 --> 00:33:38,666
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't do anything.

516
00:33:40,712 --> 00:33:46,535
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it would have been funny, though, if you keep going back to the site, there's more bunnies up here or something like that.

517
00:33:46,575 --> 00:33:47,396
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be great.

518
00:33:49,617 --> 00:33:54,320
[SPEAKER_02]: No, really, other than that, well, I've got more hack and crack stuff, but we'll get into that later.

519
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,020
[SPEAKER_01]: A little later?

520
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:55,580
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

521
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:56,701
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll do some more stories over here.

522
00:33:57,601 --> 00:34:02,004
[SPEAKER_01]: Tamagotchi's coming out for the DS, which shouldn't be much of a surprise when you consider that the Nintendogs was kind of a

523
00:34:04,653 --> 00:34:05,354
[SPEAKER_01]: Tamagotchi Corner Shop

524
00:34:27,254 --> 00:34:35,743
[SPEAKER_01]: You help Memichi or Kupachi set up a shop and the ultimate goal is to become Princess Tamako's favorite one.

525
00:34:36,724 --> 00:34:37,104
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever.

526
00:34:37,805 --> 00:34:38,025
[SPEAKER_01]: Huh?

527
00:34:38,265 --> 00:34:38,846
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, whatever.

528
00:34:38,866 --> 00:34:40,368
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly what I said about this.

529
00:34:40,948 --> 00:34:45,413
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do a beauty salon or a flower shop and you do mini games with a DS stylus.

530
00:34:46,054 --> 00:34:46,374
[SPEAKER_01]: Huh?

531
00:34:46,754 --> 00:34:47,255
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, anyway.

532
00:34:49,513 --> 00:34:54,694
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's Harvest Moon, but with convenience stores.

533
00:34:54,954 --> 00:34:57,415
[SPEAKER_02]: With characters that were pop culture ten years ago.

534
00:34:58,515 --> 00:34:58,895
[SPEAKER_02]: You know.

535
00:34:59,255 --> 00:34:59,475
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

536
00:34:59,836 --> 00:35:05,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of Tomodachi, Neopets Darkest Fairy comes out next month.

537
00:35:05,777 --> 00:35:06,897
[SPEAKER_01]: Woo!

538
00:35:07,497 --> 00:35:10,398
[SPEAKER_01]: The fairy!

539
00:35:10,438 --> 00:35:13,659
[SPEAKER_01]: Nintendo is buying back 2.2 million shares.

540
00:35:13,779 --> 00:35:15,899
[SPEAKER_01]: The possible reason for this?

541
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:18,600
[SPEAKER_01]: Square Enix trying to take over Taito.

542
00:35:18,988 --> 00:35:19,789
[SPEAKER_01]: Nintendo does not want

543
00:35:47,299 --> 00:35:49,360
[SPEAKER_01]: is kind of different and cute and does their own thing.

544
00:35:49,641 --> 00:35:52,162
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a partnership to be had here between Apple and Nintendo.

545
00:35:53,383 --> 00:35:53,643
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

546
00:35:54,264 --> 00:35:55,424
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just randomly thinking that the other day.

547
00:35:55,524 --> 00:35:58,206
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think... What?

548
00:35:58,927 --> 00:35:59,447
[SPEAKER_02]: What the hell?

549
00:35:59,487 --> 00:36:00,528
[SPEAKER_02]: There's like a sticker on here.

550
00:36:00,548 --> 00:36:01,628
[SPEAKER_02]: On your DS?

551
00:36:02,149 --> 00:36:02,769
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it came off.

552
00:36:02,789 --> 00:36:03,870
[SPEAKER_01]: Quit scratching over the stylus.

553
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:14,577
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, I was thinking, just when you mentioned Apple and Nintendo, I was just thinking, the Apples are like the Volkswagen of the PC world.

554
00:36:14,617 --> 00:36:16,038
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what they reminded me of.

555
00:36:17,708 --> 00:36:23,533
[SPEAKER_01]: You can address those cards and letters to Loki at OrangeLongTrigger.com Look, they released cute stuff that's in different colors.

556
00:36:23,593 --> 00:36:25,334
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's what Volkswagen does.

557
00:36:25,875 --> 00:36:27,696
[SPEAKER_02]: Cute cars suck.

558
00:36:29,078 --> 00:36:36,624
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so by the way, in case you missed that underlying story within the story, Square Enix made a $600 million bid for Taito this week.

559
00:36:36,984 --> 00:36:37,965
[SPEAKER_01]: And what did we try to do?

560
00:36:38,005 --> 00:36:41,268
[SPEAKER_01]: We tried to figure out what would it sound like if we combined all three names?

561
00:36:41,288 --> 00:36:42,389
[SPEAKER_01]: Square, Enix, and Taito?

562
00:36:42,809 --> 00:36:43,230
[SPEAKER_01]: Squito.

563
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:43,910
[SPEAKER_01]: Squito.

564
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:44,370
[SPEAKER_01]: Squito.

565
00:36:44,551 --> 00:36:45,211
[SPEAKER_01]: I like Squito.

566
00:36:45,271 --> 00:36:46,012
[SPEAKER_01]: I like Squito, too.

567
00:36:46,977 --> 00:36:49,619
[SPEAKER_01]: So the company will hereforth be known as Squeedo.

568
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,802
[SPEAKER_01]: Assuming this goes through, which I don't see why it won't at this point.

569
00:36:53,842 --> 00:36:54,643
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, who cares?

570
00:36:54,743 --> 00:36:55,143
[SPEAKER_02]: So what?

571
00:36:55,203 --> 00:36:58,566
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a good thing.

572
00:36:59,286 --> 00:36:59,707
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, why not?

573
00:37:01,148 --> 00:37:01,908
[SPEAKER_01]: Metroid Prime.

574
00:37:02,048 --> 00:37:03,189
[SPEAKER_01]: You know how there was this big stink?

575
00:37:03,209 --> 00:37:07,292
[SPEAKER_01]: We even talked about this on the show a couple months ago where folks were saying that, oh, this game should have been online.

576
00:37:07,572 --> 00:37:09,794
[SPEAKER_01]: If you keep pushing this game back, it should have been online.

577
00:37:10,054 --> 00:37:11,215
[SPEAKER_01]: Why didn't you put this game online?

578
00:37:11,235 --> 00:37:12,156
[SPEAKER_01]: You keep pushing this back.

579
00:37:12,236 --> 00:37:16,359
[SPEAKER_01]: And Nintendo finally saying, Metroid Prime.

580
00:37:16,823 --> 00:37:17,383
[SPEAKER_01]: Going Online.

581
00:37:18,544 --> 00:37:18,984
[SPEAKER_01]: Prime Hunters.

582
00:37:19,444 --> 00:37:20,245
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, Metroid Prime Hunters.

583
00:37:20,285 --> 00:37:20,525
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.

584
00:37:20,545 --> 00:37:21,905
[SPEAKER_01]: Metroid Prime Hunters will be going online.

585
00:37:23,386 --> 00:37:26,488
[SPEAKER_01]: It will be compatible with Nintendo's Wi-Fi service coming out later this year.

586
00:37:27,808 --> 00:37:29,209
[SPEAKER_01]: We just got pushback probably in November.

587
00:37:30,189 --> 00:37:30,930
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything else.

588
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:35,772
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't Nintendo do any... Can't any game company do anything on time?

589
00:37:37,233 --> 00:37:41,374
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted my Mario Kart, goddammit, for my birthday, and I had to wait until November.

590
00:37:41,695 --> 00:37:42,835
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not fair.

591
00:37:43,215 --> 00:37:44,076
[SPEAKER_02]: That Animal Crossing.

592
00:37:44,096 --> 00:37:44,216
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

593
00:37:44,256 --> 00:37:44,536
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

594
00:37:45,743 --> 00:37:50,788
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of the DS, Sony's flinging a little mud, calling the DS a gimmick this week.

595
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:54,772
[SPEAKER_01]: Sony releasing some commentary this week.

596
00:37:56,253 --> 00:38:00,057
[SPEAKER_01]: Vice President of the Sony Studios, Phil Harrison, making the following comments.

597
00:38:00,718 --> 00:38:03,961
[SPEAKER_01]: The idea of a handheld rivalry with Nintendo is an irrelevance.

598
00:38:04,346 --> 00:38:06,027
[SPEAKER_01]: Those formats don't appear in our planning.

599
00:38:06,047 --> 00:38:07,068
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a fair comparison.

600
00:38:07,108 --> 00:38:08,308
[SPEAKER_01]: Not fair on them, I should stress.

601
00:38:08,348 --> 00:38:10,209
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds arrogant, maybe, but that's the truth.

602
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:14,812
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just bitter that they're outselling us in Japan by a lot.

603
00:38:15,432 --> 00:38:17,153
[SPEAKER_01]: But here's the interesting quote here now.

604
00:38:17,654 --> 00:38:21,756
[SPEAKER_01]: But I fear that it won't have a lasting impact beyond that of a gimmick.

605
00:38:22,136 --> 00:38:27,219
[SPEAKER_01]: So the long-lasting appeal of the platform is at peril as a direct result of that.

606
00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:30,281
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, do you think that the DS is going to be the last handheld system?

607
00:38:30,461 --> 00:38:30,721
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

608
00:38:31,778 --> 00:38:32,438
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's another one.

609
00:38:32,719 --> 00:38:39,842
[SPEAKER_01]: Nintendo knows its target audience because it has really narrowed that down, and it's pretty much defined by a boy or girl's ability to admire Pokemon.

610
00:38:40,383 --> 00:38:41,183
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, burn!

611
00:38:42,918 --> 00:38:46,320
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and what's the PSP had released for now?

612
00:38:47,181 --> 00:38:49,943
[SPEAKER_02]: Rehashes of crappy games that were out on the PlayStation.

613
00:38:51,384 --> 00:38:51,664
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?

614
00:38:51,784 --> 00:38:59,729
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the PSP, and I don't want to take sides in the PSP versus DS war, because the PSP does have a lot of great features, especially in the fact that it's a multimedia system.

615
00:38:59,769 --> 00:39:03,392
[SPEAKER_01]: However, in games, PSP's lacking a little bit right now.

616
00:39:04,072 --> 00:39:08,435
[SPEAKER_01]: Realize there's good stuff on the horizon, like Grand Theft Auto, but as far as I'm concerned...

617
00:39:09,369 --> 00:39:13,751
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't start making these comments until you get the games to back it up, because Luminous is just one game.

618
00:39:14,371 --> 00:39:16,352
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, I have both, and you know what?

619
00:39:17,092 --> 00:39:20,073
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking at the lineup of games coming out for the PSP.

620
00:39:20,613 --> 00:39:21,554
[SPEAKER_02]: Ain't nothing impressive.

621
00:39:22,354 --> 00:39:28,777
[SPEAKER_01]: But earlier, I bet if we went back to archives of the show from February, you would hear me saying the same crap about the DS, right?

622
00:39:28,797 --> 00:39:32,018
[SPEAKER_01]: Before the PSP came out, where DS needs to put out some games.

623
00:39:32,931 --> 00:39:39,514
[SPEAKER_01]: DS has a ton of stuff coming out.

624
00:39:39,554 --> 00:39:41,715
[SPEAKER_02]: A ton of stuff just being released.

625
00:39:41,755 --> 00:39:43,536
[SPEAKER_02]: PSP, one or two a month.

626
00:39:44,496 --> 00:39:45,116
[SPEAKER_01]: With UMDs.

627
00:39:45,356 --> 00:39:45,757
[SPEAKER_01]: Galore.

628
00:39:46,537 --> 00:39:47,277
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, tons of movies.

629
00:39:47,777 --> 00:39:50,479
[SPEAKER_02]: Good for movies, but you know what?

630
00:39:50,619 --> 00:39:51,359
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a gaming system.

631
00:39:52,359 --> 00:39:57,041
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a gaming system, not an internet browser, not a movie player It's a gaming system

632
00:40:11,508 --> 00:40:22,096
[SPEAKER_01]: But when the PSP launches in Europe this week, which, by the way, PSP's launching in Europe this week, one of the games that's going to be released for it is going to let you have a custom soundtrack, and it's Touka Race Driver 2.

633
00:40:22,436 --> 00:40:27,980
[SPEAKER_01]: You can have a custom soundtrack option, and if you have music stored on your memory stick, you can use that as the music you listen to in-game.

634
00:40:28,901 --> 00:40:29,301
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty cool.

635
00:40:29,622 --> 00:40:30,362
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a cool idea.

636
00:40:30,482 --> 00:40:30,983
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, there you go.

637
00:40:31,763 --> 00:40:40,730
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, to use the feature, by the way, you have to download the free exact audio copy utility from Codemasters UK website.

638
00:40:41,018 --> 00:40:46,019
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Codemasters.co.uk So, check that out.

639
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:52,261
[SPEAKER_01]: North American release not announced yet, but Codemasters does bring a lot of their Europe games over here.

640
00:40:52,281 --> 00:40:53,722
[SPEAKER_01]: Toka is one.

641
00:40:53,842 --> 00:40:55,362
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure it'll be here in a minute.

642
00:40:56,502 --> 00:40:57,523
[SPEAKER_02]: What else you got for us tonight, Loki?

643
00:40:57,783 --> 00:41:04,105
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, speaking of the PSP, lots of stuff when it comes to doing things on the PSP that you're not supposed to.

644
00:41:04,665 --> 00:41:08,566
[SPEAKER_02]: Number one would be they found a way, or I should say

645
00:41:09,087 --> 00:41:09,967
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be released next week.

646
00:41:09,987 --> 00:41:20,029
[SPEAKER_02]: They found a way to turn back the clock or to bring the PSP from version 1.52 or 1.51 back to 1.5.

647
00:41:20,449 --> 00:41:23,830
[SPEAKER_02]: So like a DD level, your PSP.

648
00:41:23,870 --> 00:41:29,191
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, you can take your PSP and turn it back to 1.5.

649
00:41:31,051 --> 00:41:34,952
[SPEAKER_02]: Only if you haven't upgraded to 2.0 because stuff gets a little different when you get to 2.0.

650
00:41:35,669 --> 00:41:35,689
[SPEAKER_03]: P6

651
00:42:04,307 --> 00:42:05,695
[SPEAKER_02]: which looks amazing.

652
00:42:05,796 --> 00:42:06,863
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got actually...

653
00:42:07,841 --> 00:42:09,582
[SPEAKER_02]: They've done everything from being able to play videos.

654
00:42:09,602 --> 00:42:11,042
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks just like Windows, sort of.

655
00:42:11,902 --> 00:42:13,843
[SPEAKER_02]: You can play audio files and that type of stuff.

656
00:42:13,883 --> 00:42:14,403
[SPEAKER_02]: Homebrew.

657
00:42:14,663 --> 00:42:17,624
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, so this is a... It's like a shell.

658
00:42:17,884 --> 00:42:18,925
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, for PSP?

659
00:42:19,045 --> 00:42:19,405
[SPEAKER_01]: For PSP.

660
00:42:19,445 --> 00:42:23,626
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a way, like it alters the way things look and feel in the shell.

661
00:42:23,686 --> 00:42:23,886
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

662
00:42:24,026 --> 00:42:26,287
[SPEAKER_02]: What's also cool about it, though, they've added a ton of other stuff.

663
00:42:26,327 --> 00:42:34,590
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, for example, they are using a camera phone, this like add-on for some Sony Ericsson camera phone.

664
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:44,722
[SPEAKER_02]: to actually be able to have a webcam on it so you can actually take pictures with your PSP, which is very interesting, actually.

665
00:42:45,942 --> 00:42:49,582
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's going to be coming out, and I'm sure they're going to have a web browser and stuff.

666
00:42:50,443 --> 00:42:52,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Tons of work being done on it.

667
00:42:52,943 --> 00:42:55,143
[SPEAKER_01]: Website with more info for this?

668
00:42:55,363 --> 00:43:00,184
[SPEAKER_02]: PSPUpdates.com has an interview, actually, with a guy who goes by the name Fluff.

669
00:43:00,564 --> 00:43:04,885
[SPEAKER_02]: They were hosting some cool kind of...

670
00:43:05,626 --> 00:43:06,586
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the Atari 2600 in there?

671
00:43:06,686 --> 00:43:06,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome!

672
00:43:06,846 --> 00:43:07,287
[SPEAKER_02]: Adventure time.

673
00:43:35,689 --> 00:43:38,491
[SPEAKER_02]: It's time to play some... Sword Quest, here I come.

674
00:43:38,511 --> 00:43:39,452
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what they need to do?

675
00:43:39,652 --> 00:43:43,414
[SPEAKER_02]: Stella with some, like, you know, ad hoc compatibility stuff.

676
00:43:43,434 --> 00:43:45,495
[SPEAKER_02]: How about Stella with some wireless multiplayer?

677
00:43:45,516 --> 00:43:46,836
[SPEAKER_02]: Say I can play two-player combat.

678
00:43:46,896 --> 00:43:48,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, combat, it's on.

679
00:43:48,678 --> 00:43:49,558
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be awesome.

680
00:43:50,479 --> 00:43:51,820
[SPEAKER_02]: They need to make a new combat game.

681
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:53,601
[SPEAKER_02]: Atari needs to remake combat.

682
00:43:53,941 --> 00:43:56,303
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to have a petition for them to remake combat.

683
00:43:56,323 --> 00:43:56,663
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't they?

684
00:43:57,023 --> 00:44:01,586
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was one... Because you know how they remade Pong and, uh... I don't think they did combat.

685
00:44:01,666 --> 00:44:04,028
[SPEAKER_01]: I know they did Pong, I know they did Fogger...

686
00:44:05,282 --> 00:44:09,424
[SPEAKER_01]: All these Atari ones are being remade.

687
00:44:10,124 --> 00:44:11,285
[SPEAKER_01]: Warlords was one.

688
00:44:12,005 --> 00:44:13,165
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't they do combat?

689
00:44:13,205 --> 00:44:14,386
[SPEAKER_01]: They might have done combat.

690
00:44:14,426 --> 00:44:15,006
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, whatever.

691
00:44:15,026 --> 00:44:15,746
[SPEAKER_02]: They should do it again.

692
00:44:16,867 --> 00:44:17,287
[SPEAKER_02]: Make it better.

693
00:44:18,007 --> 00:44:18,608
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the thing.

694
00:44:18,648 --> 00:44:21,749
[SPEAKER_02]: The PSP needs more games that are actually over the internet.

695
00:44:22,109 --> 00:44:23,610
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got a couple so far.

696
00:44:24,770 --> 00:44:26,171
[SPEAKER_02]: It took the DS a year or so.

697
00:44:26,721 --> 00:44:29,022
[SPEAKER_01]: Give the PSP till E3 next year.

698
00:44:29,302 --> 00:44:29,962
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

699
00:44:30,022 --> 00:44:32,142
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that was one of the things that they're pushing.

700
00:44:32,182 --> 00:44:33,282
[SPEAKER_02]: You can play people over the internet.

701
00:44:33,302 --> 00:44:33,863
[SPEAKER_02]: Not yet.

702
00:44:34,103 --> 00:44:34,523
[SPEAKER_02]: Not yet.

703
00:44:35,423 --> 00:44:35,583
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

704
00:44:35,823 --> 00:44:36,123
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

705
00:44:36,243 --> 00:44:36,503
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see.

706
00:44:37,783 --> 00:44:38,043
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

707
00:44:38,564 --> 00:44:38,864
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that it?

708
00:44:39,684 --> 00:44:40,184
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for now.

709
00:44:40,244 --> 00:44:40,424
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

710
00:44:41,004 --> 00:44:50,546
[SPEAKER_01]: You know the only thing, though, about Stella, though, and Atari 2600 emulation, you know, in all honesty, even though I talk wonderful things about these games, Kaboom, of course, another one of my favorites, Pitfall 2, love it.

711
00:44:51,726 --> 00:44:53,847
[SPEAKER_01]: The emulation thrill usually only lasts about five minutes.

712
00:44:55,512 --> 00:44:56,093
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura.com

713
00:45:14,807 --> 00:45:17,528
[SPEAKER_01]: at the Ragnarok Festival, which was held in July.

714
00:45:17,608 --> 00:45:22,848
[SPEAKER_01]: Gravity said that they will reveal Ragnarok 2 online at the Tokyo Game Show.

715
00:45:23,189 --> 00:45:32,390
[SPEAKER_01]: The show is taking place September 16th, so if you're a fan of Ragnarok online, stay tuned to September and the Tokyo Game Show because they're going to have more information about Ragnarok 2.

716
00:45:33,090 --> 00:45:34,371
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really all I've got to say about that.

717
00:45:34,391 --> 00:45:35,691
[SPEAKER_01]: There was nothing else in that story.

718
00:45:36,631 --> 00:45:41,692
[SPEAKER_01]: Tekken 5 is going to be re-released in the arcades as Tekken 5

719
00:45:42,847 --> 00:45:47,632
[SPEAKER_01]: Dark Resurrection, and it's going to have two new characters as well as some newly rendered backgrounds.

720
00:45:48,473 --> 00:45:55,281
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be shown at the Amusement Machine Show in Japan on September 1st and should make its way to arcades this winter.

721
00:45:56,899 --> 00:46:25,836
[SPEAKER_01]: FYI they're also going to be showing some other interesting Namco games at this show Druaga Online which I think is really weird like suddenly Druaga is really big with Namco again you might remember this old old old old old game in the arcades Tower of Druaga I think it is well they recently released a PS2 Druaga title and now they've got Druaga Online so I guess they and I didn't maybe it was one of those things that was big in Japan and I just missed it somehow but I don't know as far as I know that series was dormant for like 20 years but I could be wrong don't send hate mail

722
00:46:27,304 --> 00:46:33,347
[SPEAKER_01]: Soul Calibur 3 has a date for Japan, November 24th, which is a little bit sooner than I expected.

723
00:46:34,248 --> 00:46:38,370
[SPEAKER_01]: November 24th for Japan, get this, October 25th for America.

724
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:41,152
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought that this was a game we wouldn't be getting until next year.

725
00:46:41,212 --> 00:46:42,633
[SPEAKER_01]: Apparently I fell asleep on this one.

726
00:46:43,813 --> 00:46:53,499
[SPEAKER_01]: Four new characters, according to Famitsu Magazine, that are also going to be in this game, Soul Calibur 3, Maxi, Song Mina, Zhang Hua, and Young Sung will also be in Soul Calibur 3.

727
00:46:54,339 --> 00:46:56,200
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's in addition to those previously announced characters.

728
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:58,282
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, make your own characters.

729
00:46:59,002 --> 00:47:05,767
[SPEAKER_01]: Soul Calibur 3 will also be having a battle arena mode where you can set certain conditions for the fight to be able to win the fight.

730
00:47:06,007 --> 00:47:07,948
[SPEAKER_01]: So, might make for some interesting...

731
00:47:10,654 --> 00:47:14,276
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess these are things that are built in Battle Arena.

732
00:47:14,296 --> 00:47:14,657
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure.

733
00:47:14,777 --> 00:47:22,061
[SPEAKER_01]: Coin Collector, where you have to collect as many coins as you can by attacking the opponent, and the coins you get are based on the attacks that you land on the opponent.

734
00:47:22,081 --> 00:47:23,522
[SPEAKER_01]: Soul Calibur Party or something?

735
00:47:23,682 --> 00:47:24,182
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

736
00:47:25,403 --> 00:47:32,247
[SPEAKER_01]: The Statue Dances is another mode where you fight against a large stone statue that's eight times the size of your character.

737
00:47:32,867 --> 00:47:34,649
[SPEAKER_01]: And it dances?

738
00:47:34,689 --> 00:47:34,789
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

739
00:47:36,141 --> 00:47:45,003
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it attacks because you're fast, but the statue is very slow, but it's very powerful, so you have to be quick, I guess.

740
00:47:45,463 --> 00:47:47,963
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody party!

741
00:47:50,304 --> 00:47:50,904
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.

742
00:47:51,704 --> 00:47:52,884
[SPEAKER_01]: They're doing interesting things with it.

743
00:47:52,924 --> 00:47:53,764
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it'll be kind of cool.

744
00:47:54,684 --> 00:48:03,566
[SPEAKER_01]: Nintendo, of course, with their release of Nintendogs, they have a new partnership between Dogs Trust for the American and European release of Nintendogs.

745
00:48:03,922 --> 00:48:10,928
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to kind of remind people that, you know, raising a puppy in real life is a lot more complicated than it is in Nintendogs.

746
00:48:11,708 --> 00:48:13,710
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't turn off a real puppy.

747
00:48:14,531 --> 00:48:16,733
[SPEAKER_01]: And I noticed this in the manual of the game, even.

748
00:48:16,753 --> 00:48:22,317
[SPEAKER_01]: There's this big disclaimer about, you know, if you want to get a real puppy, keep in mind they don't stay puppies forever.

749
00:48:22,777 --> 00:48:23,638
[SPEAKER_01]: Something to that effect.

750
00:48:23,678 --> 00:48:25,260
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you own Nintendogs, check it out.

751
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:26,180
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in the front of the manual.

752
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:27,541
[SPEAKER_01]: An interesting little disclaimer there.

753
00:48:27,561 --> 00:48:27,621
[SPEAKER_01]: Huh.

754
00:48:28,755 --> 00:48:34,877
[SPEAKER_01]: Dogs Trust, their marketing director, Adrian Bruder, saying, Dogs Trust is pleased to be associated with Nintendogs.

755
00:48:35,177 --> 00:48:41,419
[SPEAKER_01]: The philosophy behind the game has a lot in common with our own aims of ensuring that every dog is a happy and loved pet.

756
00:48:41,719 --> 00:48:47,241
[SPEAKER_01]: Despite the fame of our Dog is for Life slogan, thousands of dogs are still abandoned and unwanted every year.

757
00:48:47,321 --> 00:48:54,644
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's great that there's a game that's not only fun to play, but supports the message that responsible dog ownership means more than giving your dog an occasional stroke.

758
00:48:56,129 --> 00:48:57,970
[SPEAKER_01]: He could have used better word choice there, but whatever.

759
00:49:01,673 --> 00:49:03,534
[SPEAKER_02]: I only think of South Park right now.

760
00:49:03,814 --> 00:49:05,235
[SPEAKER_01]: Raid Rocket, Raid Rocket, Raid Rocket.

761
00:49:06,135 --> 00:49:07,236
[SPEAKER_01]: Any more stories for us, Loki?

762
00:49:08,077 --> 00:49:09,558
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't.

763
00:49:10,278 --> 00:49:11,099
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just reading.

764
00:49:11,299 --> 00:49:17,843
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some interesting thing they're talking about online poker sites and people botting on that and winning real money.

765
00:49:19,046 --> 00:49:22,107
[SPEAKER_01]: Ooh, it's just a matter of time before something like that happens.

766
00:49:22,748 --> 00:49:23,348
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.

767
00:49:23,368 --> 00:49:25,089
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, hmm.

768
00:49:25,109 --> 00:49:42,776
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when I was, that email I read today, when I was doing some of the research, I actually was reading comments on, I don't know, Slashdot or some other site, where people were saying, if somebody, it's just a matter of time before somebody does this in a game where it's real money at stake, as opposed to fake items worth real money in the online auction world.

769
00:49:42,856 --> 00:49:45,998
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I guess it's on this game called Win Hold'em, and...

770
00:49:47,031 --> 00:50:08,106
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it's just articles about the rise of internet botting and they're talking about on the internet nobody knows you're a bot and I guess last year the poker sites raked in 1.4 billion dollars and I mean just someone runs a bot and they can win tons of money.

771
00:50:08,927 --> 00:50:09,607
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of crazy.

772
00:50:11,549 --> 00:50:11,929
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.

773
00:50:12,209 --> 00:50:12,429
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

774
00:50:13,850 --> 00:50:14,111
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

775
00:50:14,411 --> 00:50:15,972
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess we're on to our last story of the night.

776
00:50:17,486 --> 00:50:20,467
[SPEAKER_01]: and the last story of the night has to do with male nudity in a video game.

777
00:50:20,667 --> 00:50:21,087
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh god.

778
00:50:22,787 --> 00:50:25,228
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure DarkSakura should be very happy right now.

779
00:50:25,548 --> 00:50:27,188
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, don't shut off your iPod just yet.

780
00:50:27,248 --> 00:50:28,028
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, don't turn it off.

781
00:50:28,469 --> 00:50:30,089
[SPEAKER_01]: There's actually more to this story here.

782
00:50:31,089 --> 00:50:34,330
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually a Midway game and it's their Blitz series.

783
00:50:34,650 --> 00:50:36,230
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like a football series of games.

784
00:50:36,390 --> 00:50:38,711
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Blitz the League because, you know...

785
00:50:39,167 --> 00:50:40,528
[SPEAKER_02]: They can't use NFL anymore.

786
00:50:40,728 --> 00:50:41,309
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.

787
00:50:41,389 --> 00:50:42,169
[SPEAKER_01]: So they don't do this.

788
00:50:42,209 --> 00:50:43,350
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just Blitz the League.

789
00:50:44,150 --> 00:50:53,357
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, what's interesting is that supposedly, rumor is it's one of their viral marketers, the people that pose as regular fans that are infiltrating the message board.

790
00:50:53,377 --> 00:50:58,340
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there was a post on the Midway message boards that's a screenshot from Blitz the League.

791
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:01,682
[SPEAKER_01]: And it shows a cheerleader about ready to pull her shirt off.

792
00:51:01,943 --> 00:51:04,704
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, she's going to show her boobs, which is nothing new in a video game.

793
00:51:05,045 --> 00:51:08,187
[SPEAKER_01]: But what's also interesting about it is that there's a streaker...

794
00:51:09,179 --> 00:51:09,579
[SPEAKER_01]: and DarkSakura.com

795
00:51:38,757 --> 00:51:43,078
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna add drug use, and we're gonna, you know, add nudity, I guess.

796
00:51:43,158 --> 00:51:47,659
[SPEAKER_02]: So, it's a mature... Out of all the football games that come out, this is a mature-rated football game.

797
00:51:48,099 --> 00:51:49,960
[SPEAKER_02]: The rest are for everybody.

798
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:55,701
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm interested because, you know, NFL Blitz was awesome, so this should be no different.

799
00:51:55,981 --> 00:51:58,402
[SPEAKER_01]: Props to Midway for thinking creative, I guess.

800
00:51:58,842 --> 00:52:04,623
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, those games like Madden and stuff, even though we don't talk a whole lot about sports games, because honestly, I just don't play them.

801
00:52:04,743 --> 00:52:06,043
[SPEAKER_01]: Madden was a disappointment.

802
00:52:06,303 --> 00:52:08,244
[SPEAKER_02]: From what I've heard from people that have been playing, they're like,

803
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:15,903
[SPEAKER_01]: But previous sports titles, all these EA sports titles, they get more and more realistic and they start feeling like you're watching Monday Night Football.

804
00:52:16,664 --> 00:52:20,886
[SPEAKER_01]: Midway's taking that one step further with the realism aspect by adding the streakers.

805
00:52:22,807 --> 00:52:23,287
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.

806
00:52:23,627 --> 00:52:24,868
[SPEAKER_01]: Final thoughts, Loki, tonight?

807
00:52:26,368 --> 00:52:27,389
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll check out the game.

808
00:52:27,813 --> 00:52:32,316
[SPEAKER_02]: Midway's coming in next week, so I'll have some questions for them.

809
00:52:32,456 --> 00:52:33,436
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, sounds good.

810
00:52:34,557 --> 00:52:37,859
[SPEAKER_01]: My final thought is thank you guys very much for listening, and hey, send us an email.

811
00:52:37,919 --> 00:52:44,243
[SPEAKER_01]: Let us know how we're doing, togo, T-O-G-O, at orangeonstrade.com, or if you want to contact one of us directly, send Loki some hate mail.

812
00:52:44,750 --> 00:52:49,473
[SPEAKER_01]: or me some fan mail, you can always check that out on our website, www.orangeloungevideo.com.

813
00:52:49,733 --> 00:52:56,156
[SPEAKER_01]: And apologies to fans of our three-hour show that didn't get to hear us this Sunday because we had to cancel our live show this week.

814
00:52:56,496 --> 00:52:57,197
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be back next week.

815
00:52:57,237 --> 00:52:58,898
[SPEAKER_01]: Got lots of music for you for next week.

816
00:52:59,218 --> 00:53:01,359
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we got a lot of Mimani remixes coming up on next week's show.

817
00:53:01,459 --> 00:53:07,062
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got to beg Tomo, which is the distributor of Age Tech, to make an RPG make for the PSP.

818
00:53:07,502 --> 00:53:08,563
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my goal next week.

819
00:53:08,905 --> 00:53:09,225
[SPEAKER_01]: Very cool.

820
00:53:09,485 --> 00:53:15,047
[SPEAKER_01]: And I received a bucket load of information on Percussion Master this week, so I'm going to be talking about that next week's show.

821
00:53:15,167 --> 00:53:15,387
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

822
00:53:15,547 --> 00:53:15,808
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

823
00:53:16,428 --> 00:53:17,308
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, that's that.

824
00:53:17,348 --> 00:53:19,509
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for downloading our podcast and listening to us.

825
00:53:19,589 --> 00:53:20,589
[SPEAKER_01]: We appreciate your support.

826
00:53:20,909 --> 00:53:33,234
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell a friend about Orange Zones Radio to go, because honestly, when we have to compete against the bigger and bigger guys, ABC and all these other big podcasts that are out there, the only way that indie podcasts stay alive

827
00:53:35,568 --> 00:53:39,850
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess to get bigger at all and get the word out is for people to tell other people.

828
00:53:39,910 --> 00:53:43,111
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we try getting Leo Laporte, but he just doesn't want to.

829
00:53:43,791 --> 00:53:44,512
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got his own podcast.

830
00:53:44,532 --> 00:53:46,592
[SPEAKER_01]: He said something about going back to G4 or something.

831
00:53:48,273 --> 00:53:48,853
[SPEAKER_01]: Poor guy.

832
00:53:49,393 --> 00:53:50,794
[SPEAKER_01]: Fight the fight from the inside.

833
00:53:50,814 --> 00:53:53,195
[SPEAKER_01]: On that note, good night everybody.

834
00:53:53,215 --> 00:53:53,655
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a good one.

835
00:53:55,225 --> 00:53:58,812
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the end of another Orange Lounge Radio To Go edition.

836
00:53:59,113 --> 00:54:04,643
[SPEAKER_00]: This podcast is a proud part of www.orangeloungeradio.com.

837
00:54:05,104 --> 00:54:06,106
[SPEAKER_00]: See you next update.
