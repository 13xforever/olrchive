529	4432	Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of August 8th.
7633	15578	You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.
15838	19520	Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
20981	23883	Welcome to another edition of Orange Lounge Radio To Go.
24503	28826	I am Loki, and with us tonight we have the lovely DarkSakura.
29983	32204	Hello, hello.
55663	60226	I like to start everything off how Sky normally does it with how was your gaming week?
60626	62468	So Jamie, what did you play this week?
63949	67251	Other than widescreen Pong, which actually I didn't play this week.
67351	71514	I played some PSO, looked at some games.
71554	75576	I actually have Rob's birthday present here that I finally got my hands on.
76137	78478	Something that he was wanting, but I'll let him talk about that next week.
79619	85443	Mainly, I've been trying to get stuff together because I start school next week, plus I have an announcement.
87305	87905	What's the announcement?
88606	91927	I'm getting married on September 1st, so I've been sort of busy doing wedding stuff.
92327	94228	Unfortunately, they don't have wedding planner at the game.
94728	95028	Not yet.
97209	97969	Wow, that's pretty soon.
99590	100010	Let's see.
100510	103151	Well, this week I played quite a bit, actually.
103691	107753	I started off the week with beating Star Soldier on the PSP, which is fun.
108353	109594	So now I'm done with that.
110534	115556	Then I actually played We Love Katamari, the Japanese version, so that was really nice.
116278	117299	I've played that.
117339	118839	I've played that and it's kind of crap.
118859	119240	I don't know.
119260	120360	I thought it was kind of fun, but...
141309	142150	I'm just weird like that.
143750	149113	Then also, I was able to play, let's see, Burnout 3.
149233	151694	That game is so much fucking fun.
151714	158217	It's definitely worth the best racing game of the year.
158297	159177	That G4 2005, they said, you know.
161560	163901	Great games, just like an arcade racing game.
163981	165281	You can smash through everything.
165542	167182	It's really, really, really fun.
167202	168363	I cannot stress how fun it is.
169203	170963	I got to play some In the Groove this week.
172504	173925	Yeah, well, we know how that is.
174165	179206	And it's basically about as bad as I thought it was.
179547	183828	So I'm glad you know that I was renting it and not buying it.
184588	188270	And I actually got to try out a little bit of Genji.
189690	199663	which is pretty cool, Japanese I can't understand it, and Namco X Capcom, which has one of the most kickass anime intros I've ever seen for a game, so really cool.
200885	201325	Anyways...
203334	208256	Actually, I was going to try that one game that was suggested to me by one of our listeners.
209616	214257	However, again, with this week being as hectic as it was, I haven't got a chance, although I've started the download on it.
214317	224761	But another one of our listeners has pointed me in the direction of another game that I'm going to be giving a try sometime this week as well that's along the same lines.
224781	225841	It's supposed to be pretty cool.
227944	229905	All good things come from Florida.
250569	255110	Anyways, we've got Jack Thompson coming after Killer7 now.
255970	272075	And basically, his quote is, There is no question in my mind that a video game containing full-blown sex sequences cannot be rated anything other than adults only, rather than M. The full-blown sex sequences are no more than you could see in an R-rated movie.
274065	285908	But for those who aren't keeping tally, Jack Thompson was the guy that actually brought this whole hot coffee thing to the table and blew it way out of proportion, like everything, and just is coming after yet more games.
286848	289248	In other words, he's the lead asshole in charge of the brigade.
290269	291629	Yes, he sucks.
292249	300591	And basically, he actually did an interview on Chatterbox Video Game Radio, basically bitching about different things, and including...
301321	307665	How he says Will Wright wants Electronic Arts to collaborate with the porn industry to allow wholesale modification of their game, Sims 2.
308825	310747	Because of this whole third-party porn thing.
310807	314929	Which, by the way, has nothing to do with EA's game in the first place.
315169	318251	This is completely like some perverted people out there making mods.
318271	325535	Because Sims 2 allows you to actually make third-party mods, including brand new clothing, skins, and furniture and whatnot.
326515	329037	And of course, you know there's going to be somebody out there that's going to make a nude skin.
330157	335901	So, he's blaming them, saying, oh, well, you know, because you're allowing modification in the game, you're to blame for this crap.
336762	337382	It's retarded.
337902	340144	Honestly, extremely retarded, this guy is.
340884	344267	I wish we could get him on our show so I could punch him in the face, but, you know, that's just me.
345047	347369	But, the other thing.
347708	347928	and so on.
366149	370231	We actually have anti-bullying groups coming out to Rockstar about this game saying they shouldn't be released.
370511	372212	And they have a list of demands.
372672	377754	A list of demands that they basically wanted them to donate money to this anti-bullying fund.
378074	381755	They're saying that games like Grand Theft Auto and stuff actually raise insurance rates.
382056	386097	Just throwing out all these bogus, weird claims that mean nothing.
386197	387638	They're just groundless.
388772	404000	They obviously haven't read, like I brought up last week, about the FBI's reports and stuff put out by our government stating that crime has gone down since the release of the first PlayStation.
405001	411804	Wouldn't that go to show that they're actually being given an outlet for this aggression instead of going out and actually committing the crime?
412045	413805	I mean, does that make sense, maybe?
414226	416487	No, they've got their heads too far up their asses, unfortunately.
419025	430830	Basically, we've had activists, they're demonstrating outside of New York's, or Rockstar's New York offices, and they had a list of demands, which I like to read some of their lists, which is great.
432423	437426	They demand that Rockstar not to release Bully under any circumstances.
437526	442289	Volunteer to sell its violent and sexually explicit games in adult video stores only.
442669	451534	Let parents return Grand Theft Auto for a full refund until they do a national awareness campaign to educate parents of the possible effects.
452055	457038	Create a fund for victims of unauthorized use of motor vehicle and carjackings, etc.,
457765	466188	Make a national apology for misleading and lying to children and parents and legislators about their intentions and causing insurance premiums to skyrocket.
467985	476331	Right, and it says they have to give a written response within five business days of the receipt of these demands.
477331	485097	First of all, they're not going to get any of that crap, because there is no, again, like I said before, there is no legal precedent.
485177	487558	I'm sorry, they're so full of shit right at this.
488179	489600	I mean, think about this.
490700	497225	How is a video game responsible for insurance rates increasing, though it has nothing to do with that?
498145	504429	The game itself, has there been anything published that says it has a sexually explicit content for Bully?
504649	505910	Something about being in school?
507470	510292	No, they're just saying that they're totally speculating.
510312	511693	This game isn't even done yet.
511913	515515	They haven't even seen anything except for one screenshot that's out there.
515675	520458	Actually, I've seen one screenshot, maybe four different screenshots, but it's all pretty much the same thing.
521358	524160	No one knows what this thing is about other than the main character is a bully.
525697	526057	That's it.
526217	529058	They don't even know what the game's about and they're already bitching about it.
529439	529979	You know what?
530459	531259	This is the other thing.
531340	533621	The games are rated M for mature.
533641	535761	17 and over, people.
535922	541144	You're telling me that an average 17-year-old in this day and age does not know what sex is.
542541	542961	Oh, yeah.
543321	543861	Yeah, I'm sure.
544322	546802	Okay, what do you think a 17-year-old has done more?
547182	548903	Had sex or murdered people?
550023	554764	I probably said, you know, played with, you know, thumb and five fingers, but that's another story.
555205	556825	They at least know what it's for, right?
558405	559326	Let me put it this way, okay?
559466	561946	The average teenager out there knows what sex is.
562307	563447	I mean, it's taught in schools.
563687	567308	Hell, we have, you know, sexual content in PG-13 movies nowadays.
567368	567548	I mean...
568083	568684	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
589497	590157	DarkSakura.com
618948	622330	What the hell do you expect these games to have content-wise anyways?
622651	626493	Killer7, hmm, that must be about ponies and fairies, right?
626914	630596	You know, Grand Theft Auto, hmm, what does Grand Theft Auto mean?
630616	632338	It means stealing fucking cars!
632658	634619	What do you think that's gonna be about, you know?
635100	642085	Horses and ponies and magical, you know, pixies and, you know, the world of fun and, you know, good behavior?
642305	645107	No, it's about violence and about...
645567	646208	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
674594	675074	Let's see.
676315	678316	We've actually got some interesting stuff.
679256	683559	One thing is Sony is already saying that the Xbox 360 may suck.
683899	689402	And just because of that, they may release their PlayStation 3 in 2007.
689962	697286	The reason behind it is they're worried that the 360 might have a weak launch library and basically it's going to fail.
698158	700041	Right, yeah, that's gonna fail, alright.
700061	703926	Then that first next-gen system coming out, and they're hyping the hell out of this, and it's gonna fail.
704046	708873	No, honestly, people are gonna buy this game, or this system, whether it has crappy games or not.
708933	709734	I mean, look at the DS.
710996	713440	Though, remember what happened with the Dreamcast, sadly.
714966	720547	True, but I mean the Xbox 360, I mean you've got MTV backing it, I don't think so.
721067	726788	But the PlayStation 3 launching in 2007, I think that's a big mistake in the first place.
727008	739610	They're basically going to kill themselves if they end up doing that because you're going to have the revolution come out and even let's say that the Xbox 360 does flop, well then you've got the revolution, people are going to be buying that and well, where's Sony?
740190	743891	Well, they're just not there because they're waiting for their big launch library.
744938	745978	It's not going to happen.
746319	753041	But they're hoping to ride the success of the PlayStation 2 because it's going to drop down to $99, which is good.
753281	757383	I think they'll outsell the Xbox, but it's not going to outsell the Xbox 360.
758604	758924	I don't know.
759244	763486	But either way, I'm going to be buying both systems when they come out, whenever that is.
766260	768761	I've actually got some news in relation to the 360.
771563	781728	There actually is a preliminary release list from the Japan Xbox Summit 2005.
783368	787210	Some of the ones brought up, they had like a mixtape trailer of different things.
789231	792593	We have Tony Hawk's American Wasteland.
792753	793893	We have Quake 4.
794674	800096	We have A-Train X. And for anyone who isn't into those train sims, again, this is the Japan one.
800437	802398	And the A-Train series did do very well.
803038	805739	Test Drive Unlimited, a Gundam game.
805759	807140	Bondi's putting out a Gundam game.
807880	811922	And also two titles that are, I'm supposing, anime themed.
813043	814684	Bon Presto putting out Super Robot Wars.
815584	841458	and of course Super Robot Wars has been going on since like the Super Famicom so it's been out for a while King of Fighters Maximum Impact 2 Resident Evil 5 Dead Rising from Capcom we have Eidos is putting out a title D3 Publishers Electronic Arts putting out some soccer and NBA games Need for Speed Most Wanted The Godfather
842866	855155	Enchant Arm, Frontier Groove, Tokyo Extreme Racer, Far East of Eden, Hudson Soft Rumble Roses XX winning 11, Ridge Racer 6, Frame City Killer There's too much coming out that I don't think it's going to flop.
868652	875996	Well, what their strategy this time is actually listen to what the Japanese players want instead of just releasing a system there that's basically an American system.
876517	877978	Another title that was coming out was Genji.
878158	880319	Well, actually, that's PlayStation 3, not 360.
880659	884662	Anyways, but yeah, they're definitely releasing some good library titles.
885302	886383	I can't wait for Ridge Racer 6.
887363	889385	Ridge Racer 6 is going to be fucking awesome.
890545	893287	And Ghost Recon, the new ones are going to be great.
894625	901530	I'm still wanting to know what Treasure is putting out, because Treasure was the group that gave us Silhouette Mirage and Gunstar Heroes.
901951	902811	They're pretty awesome.
904733	909416	I also saw that Gun was mentioned on there, which is probably going to be one of the best Western games ever.
910397	915961	Just from what I've seen so far, it's coming out on the two current consoles right now, PlayStation 2 and Xbox.
916702	918824	That's going to be amazing from what I've seen.
920117	924618	Dead or Alive, I mean, three Dead or Alive games is a little overkill for me, I think.
925279	933281	Unless, unless, there's new Dead or Alive Beach Volleyball, in which case, oh, there is a brand new Dead or Alive Beach Volleyball.
933761	941564	Yes, yes, more titillating action fan service to the extreme on Xbox 360.
941804	942264	I can't wait.
942444	946165	I can't wait for the Dead or Alive movie because this is, I hope it's all TNA.
946685	947246	That's what I hope.
948146	948566	By the way,
949630	957117	I did see some trailers, they had a new teaser for Aeon Flux, and I might have to say that that movie's gonna kick ass.
957757	961080	And the game's also gonna kick ass, because it looks pretty sweet so far from what I've seen.
962701	963582	Alright, awesome!
964583	965704	Did you have any other stories for us?
968171	972733	I have another one, of course, Midway's doing Feel the Rush.
973434	976275	They've got some celebrity talent and music lined up for it.
976815	983799	The thing that has me the most excited about this is it's really got an RPG element to this.
985460	988381	One of the main rivals in the game is voiced by Bill Bellamy.
990122	997507	We have also just quite a number of people lending their talent from West Coast Customs.
997727	1000348	There's also the list of cars.
1000748	1003390	We have a bunch of new Dodges like the new Charger.
1003890	1007752	We have the H2, which is a piece of crap, you know, fake Hummer.
1008613	1010854	We have a 1966 Pontiac GTO.
1011154	1011695	Isn't that cool?
1013135	1041950	the new Lotus Exige we have Mitsubishi Spider we have the Lancer Evo 5 Skyline GTR which is actually one of my favorite cars but also you're going to be able to upgrade your cars with official parts you know we have Nismo which was I'm actually sort of surprised to not see any of the rally art stuff in there since they've got Mitsubishi in there but it looks like it's going to be a fairly interactive racing game I think it's going to be pretty cool
1044048	1044268	Nice.
1046509	1054590	Now, obviously, there's a lot of stuff coming out in the future with the brand new systems coming out, but let's talk about some of the stuff that's going to be coming out in the next few weeks here.
1054690	1061552	First off, we have next week releasing one of the godfathers of all sports games, Madden 2006, which is going to be awesome.
1061912	1066373	They have the brand new Superstar Mode, which actually links up with the NCAA 2006 as well.
1067113	1071234	If you like those sports games, personally, I couldn't care for them, but, you know, they're really good.
1071912	1072573	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1089488	1090029	A lot of fun.
1090549	1096014	And also we have coming out Darkwatch which is going to be the following week.
1097395	1107504	Basically a very interesting vampire western type game which plays very similar to Halo 2 and is freaking incredible is what it is.
1109646	1116532	Personally I'm waiting for the stuff in September like We Love Katamari and the new Ultimate Spider-Man and that type of stuff.
1117679	1120741	Remember, I take my wedding presents in video games.
1121361	1123062	You know, not necessarily housewares.
1126583	1127004	Oh, boy.
1128724	1134147	The other thing also we should be looking forward to, the new Grand Theft Auto, which is going to be coming out, obviously, in October.
1135088	1136448	So, yeah, lots of fun stuff.
1138689	1141591	Now, DarkSakura, do you have any advice for us this week?
1143837	1149859	Do I ever... Today's bit of advice is how to escape from a bear.
1150359	1152659	Because we all need to know how to escape from a bear.
1154040	1155880	How to escape from a giant hairy gay guy?
1158141	1159981	Remember, we shipped... I'm sorry.
1160562	1161262	I'm not going to go there.
1161842	1162142	Okay.
1162802	1164943	Today's bit of advice is how to escape from a bear.
1166352	1170776	1.
1166792	1170776	If you see a bear but it does not see you, make your presence known and back away.
1171317	1173239	Talk loudly, clap, sing, or call out.
1173660	1176102	There is no guaranteed minimum safe distance from a bear.
1176403	1177223	The farther the better.
1177704	1179366	If you are in a car, remain in your vehicle.
1179606	1181608	Do not get out, even for a quick photo.
1182009	1182970	Keep your windows up.
1183070	1185332	Do not impede the bear from crossing the road.
1187374	1190995	2.
1188094	1190995	If the bear looks as if it is about to attack, do not run.
1191075	1191715	Remain still.
1192156	1195757	Remember, bears can run much faster than humans, and bears can climb trees.
1196237	1201859	However, documented attacks show that an attack by another black bear often ends up when the person stops fighting.
1202379	1204099	Also ends, I'm sorry, when the person stops fighting.
1204880	1204099	3.
1205440	1209061	If you are lying still and the bear attacks, strike back with anything you can.
1209381	1211281	Go for the bear's eyes or its snout.
1211682	1215803	But my final bit of advice, don't feed the bears.
1217970	1220371	and also don't cover yourself in honey.
1221972	1222793	The Bears.
1222813	1226635	Do you remember that on Saturday Night Live where they used to have Ditka?
1226815	1227295	That was cool.
1228796	1229616	The Bears.
1230076	1230617	Okay.
1231597	1235219	Well, a little bit of the hack and cracking news we've got.
1236240	1238221	Starting off with the PlayStation Portable.
1238321	1239401	Yes, that's right, folks.
1239421	1240562	You'll be able to use it with the Xbox 360.
1240602	1241022	Man, that...
1242822	1245064	Isn't a bad idea, I don't know what is.
1245704	1256532	But basically, you'll be able to actually use their media browser on the 360 to do everything from view your photos to listen to MP3s that are on the PSP.
1256973	1261716	But pretty much it can sync up with any music player or whatnot, iPod, etc.
1262697	1264599	And the PSP being, you know, just like those.
1266080	1267120	We have the brand new...
1268663	1269524	Jack and Daxter Fired Up
1288486	1295989	And other news, because we can't just cover all the PSP crack and stuff, we've also got to cover the PlayStation 2.
1296650	1306754	And for the PlayStation 2, they actually released Media Player Pro, which is a, of course, media player for the PlayStation 2, which supports CD audio.
1307835	1309696	Actually, you can use it to view your...
1311417	1312778	The Key Launcher Key Launcher
1342110	1342850	Doom was ported to the iPod.
1366684	1371746	You know, those people, they'll port anything on Linux, and Doom is probably the next best thing.
1372627	1374347	I'm still waiting for Linux for Toaster.
1374507	1376388	You know, my bagels need to burn programs too.
1377789	1378289	You know what?
1378729	1384292	We need Linux for the DS, because honestly, there's nothing for the DS right now.
1385172	1386433	I need mine in 10 dogs.
1386473	1387373	That's what I need too.
1389254	1391855	I get to play with my puppies, but for five minutes at a time.
1392896	1393416	Ha ha ha.
1395242	1399284	Other things, more stuff for the browser, the 2.0 browser.
1399964	1411811	Some people have actually done a pretty cool WinPSPortal 2.0, which resembles a desktop, a Windows XP desktop, and actually is pretty cool from what I've tried out so far.
1412431	1415213	I personally don't have my PSP updated to 2.0 because...
1416413	1417434	Um, just not going to do that.
1417614	1437241	But the other thing was they also found out one of the little, um, things about the PSP 2.0 is that it will launch, um, custom programs if you put it in the update folder, but then immediately discovers that the program is not what it's signed to be and then stops loading it, but that might be, that might lead to, um, them breaking through the version 2.0 firmware.
1438381	1439962	Only a matter of time before they do that.
1442639	1445680	Well, we can hold our breath, but we might turn blue before it happens.
1445780	1450121	Then again, maybe we'll just turn like a slight shade of purple and then take our breath again.
1451861	1454342	Actually, I wanted to dip into the mailbox if you were done.
1455182	1455442	Okay.
1456582	1460503	We actually have gotten quite a number of emails, but I'm going to go ahead and read just one or two.
1460963	1465805	We got one from our buddy Steve who wrote in, wanted to...
1467305	1470267	I actually thank and congratulate us for keeping up with an awesome show.
1470627	1475090	You know, you were one of the people who made our win at the podcast awards possible, so thank you.
1476591	1478473	Also, I'm just going to go ahead and quote here.
1478493	1483756	I have to say the enthusiasm and overall appeal was particularly evident in this week's episode, the August 1st episode.
1484557	1489961	Not only did you break your old record for length, but you all seemed just so much more into the content, which was great to hear.
1490381	1491422	There's a reason for that.
1492242	1494163	We did the podcast on Saturday.
1494824	1495765	We did it early.
1496865	1500328	We were wide awake and not fresh from doing our three hour show.
1500448	1504192	However, we'll try to recreate that enthusiasm, don't you think?
1505273	1506974	Yeah, we try to be very enthusiastic.
1507014	1511018	This week is hard because we're missing one of our co-hosts.
1511058	1516783	It's hard to be enthusiastic on Sundays because you have to work on Mondays, but hey, whatever.
1516843	1517243	It's all good.
1518863	1524704	Another question he wanted to ask is, wanted to know what the background music during my Vice piece was.
1525445	1529285	To quote, it sounds fabulously happy, and I'd love to hear where it came from.
1529565	1531946	It's actually Journey to Wonderland from Keyboard Mania.
1532526	1538968	Because we started off Bimani-themed, and that one just fits so many wrong things, and so many things it's more appropriate for.
1540348	1543849	But he wants to say once again, thanks for the excellent show, and hope you keep up the great work, guys.
1544989	1545970	We do our best.
1546190	1546610	We try.
1546870	1547671	We really try.
1547791	1548732	We're glad you love us.
1550533	1552814	And suddenly I'm reminded of the Quizness commercials.
1552874	1553935	We love the subs.
1555236	1557357	I'm just very random today.
1559018	1564042	We also got one from a guy named Ben who said...
1565151	1569574	He actually became aware of us through DDR Freak.
1571135	1577699	I'm actually a moderator on DDR Freak, and all of us have frequented there in the past when we were strictly Just Bad Money related.
1579680	1584263	But he wrote in to say that he thought that Loki was great drunk.
1586765	1591768	Ah, yes, the classic drunk episode, which we will be recreating the drunk episode on September 11th.
1592549	1594873	My birthday, which also happens to fall on a Sunday.
1596016	1597478	I will be drinking that day as well.
1597739	1604091	Hopefully this time not throwing up all over the place, but still as incoherent as usual.
1606078	1616126	You know what we might have to do, because it's still tentative, but I'm thinking about doing my friend-related wedding reception at Dave & Buster's on the 10th.
1617407	1622491	Getting everybody as intoxicated as possible and recording a drunken podcast from the middle of Dave & Buster's.
1622511	1623392	Wouldn't that be crazy?
1625213	1625674	Eh, maybe.
1626394	1627175	I just don't want to drive.
1629472	1638045	He also wants to add in that Halo 2 isn't just another first-person shooter, and Grand Theft Auto San Andreas is a fucking great game, but it is not a revolution.
1638185	1638826	Have a great day.
1640548	1642611	I can agree with the latter statement, yeah.
1643012	1643753	I can agree with that.
1645395	1656742	Also, though, we have an interview posted with the Senior Vice President of Software for Square Enix, Hiroichi Tanaka.
1658103	1659324	Just a little bit about this.
1659344	1662626	It has to do more with Final Fantasy XI on the Xbox 360.
1663927	1668090	They said actually that it's very easy since the Xbox 360 uses DirectX.
1668850	1674094	It is going to run in time with the PlayStation and PC versions of Final Fantasy XI.
1674994	1684999	One thing about it though, where it will be using the 360's Xbox Live chat function, you will not be able to chat with people on the PC since it's only on the Xbox 360 servers.
1685860	1690302	And it's not a built-in function of Final Fantasy XI, it's just accessing the 360 servers.
1694349	1701535	As far as the keyboard support, he says that Microsoft is thinking about adding a text input device separately.
1702096	1705738	But I remember Microsoft saying in the past that they were never going to do a keyboard.
1707100	1713545	No, they're doing a really ugly controller with a stupid QWERTY keyboard that's crammed onto it as well.
1714565	1714806	Ugly.
1715006	1716447	I've seen the pictures of it.
1717270	1731086	but you know they had something like that before on GameCube for Phantasy Star Online but the thing is is that if they keep the controllers very similarly all they have to do is have the same keyboard adapter that Phantasy Star Online uses and then they don't have to do anything
1731854	1733115	They don't do anything anyways.
1733175	1735657	I mean, the Xbox 360, I'd imagine.
1735757	1736258	I'm not sure.
1736598	1744805	I know the PlayStation 3 has USB ports and the Revolution is going to have the USB ports as well.
1745806	1749609	And basically, why not just sell a keyboard?
1750630	1754353	Either have it use a USB keyboard and mouse or...
1755100	1757903	I really think they should stick with what they did with Phantasy Star.
1757943	1762647	Also, another question asked is if it was going to be using the PlayOnline servers or the Microsoft servers.
1762707	1766710	It was specified they'll be using PlayOnline delays in development right now.
1782564	1786588	is that they have the window specifics up but are still working on Japanese character input.
1786848	1790692	There's a really funky screenshot on here where one of the characters, you can't see his face.
1791153	1792394	His face is totally not rendered.
1793635	1798480	About as far as if it's going to cost the same as the other versions or a different fee,
1799000	1828302	they have not yet decided but also North American audiences do get to beta test Final Fantasy XI on Xbox 360 first since the 360 will be released here beta testing will be free when you get the Xbox 360 you'll be able to apply for the beta test as far as anything else though they're looking to sell for about $29 and I don't really see anything else major about that
1831089	1834672	Alright, we're all on the topic of the 360 once again.
1836273	1841838	The question that's on everybody's mind, will the old games play on the new systems?
1844688	1848990	Well, Xbox says, eh, maybe.
1849850	1853751	Basically, what's going to happen is only some games will be able to play.
1854132	1855432	Why, you may ask?
1855552	1863095	Because unlike the PlayStation 3, which actually uses, you know, they put the actual old chips on there, so it's not actual emulation.
1863155	1864635	It's playing straight out the old chips.
1865376	1870958	The Xbox, being that this brand new system is built on the NVIDIA graphics card,
1871918	1873459	The old one was built on ATI.
1873479	1876000	Uh-oh, that's a problem.
1876460	1879181	Well, so they're going to have to emulate it.
1879601	1882823	And basically only some games will work with the emulation.
1883543	1886444	However, it's going to be decided case by case.
1886524	1888405	Usually it's going to be the most popular games.
1889245	1897669	It says right now they're predicting that the numbers could be somewhere between 5 and 20 of the games will be backwards compatible.
1898655	1921151	which that's kind of crappy if you ask me but supposedly I guess if you maybe if you get Xbox Live or something like that maybe they'll add more but fine let me come on now and they're not even selling Xboxes right now either they've stopped production on Xboxes for the 360 to get it ready for launch that's gonna fuck over a lot of players right now that's what I think
1923318	1928368	What's the point of even having backwards playability if it's only going to work for five games?
1928388	1930372	That's kind of retarded.
1931354	1932957	That's lame, but that's what they're doing.
1934978	1938140	Sounds like a bunch of geniuses over Microsoft, doesn't it?
1940001	1950366	As far as other news, I'm sure that everybody who's listened to the show for a while knew that I was pretty excited about the Gizmondo coming out, putting up by Tiger Telematics.
1950986	1957910	However, they have requested or are looking for 50,000 units from the Gizmondo manufacturer.
1959310	1961512	However, they're saying that there are...
1963073	1987212	and they're also saying that numerous USA retailers intend to stock the product so they're working on a press release however the system has been delayed they're actually they said that they have an unannounced highly significant game title for release but there's not really anything else saying on here looking for it looks like later on this month but it's we're supposed to be receiving more information over the next few weeks
1989426	1998897	And in other news I'd like to classify as too little too late, the Nokia N-Gage QD has announced that they're going to be releasing a silver-colored version.
2000398	2003442	Unfortunately, the silver-colored version will not make it suck any less.
2004417	2004938	Back to you!
2022401	2024223	Basically, I love how this is described.
2024263	2026464	Super fast action and irreverent humor.
2027045	2029266	However, it's being released in the smaller format.
2029307	2035211	The game features 13 levels and maintains a faithful conversion of the style of the game.
2035291	2039254	There are no plans for a US release that have yet been announced.
2039535	2043978	I mean, I'm sure we're going to eventually get it, because there's hardly anything we don't eventually get.
2044438	2046660	However, fair play to you.
2046700	2047461	You get it first.
2049207	2051350	I want them to release Seven Sins over here.
2051510	2057757	That's something that the UK has that we need to have so that they go ballistic over that one, because that's all it is, is full-on sex.
2058738	2059659	What about the Playboy game?
2059699	2061421	I never see them coming after the Playboy game.
2063217	2068021	I think that all those people trying to censor our games and everything need to get that pine tree out their ass.
2068041	2069423	Those roots are starting to stick out their mouth.
2070604	2074487	The problem is, is us gamers don't really have any way we can combat this.
2074687	2078671	It's just, you know, it's all these politicians and, you know, law people.
2078711	2080513	They're just, you know, kind of coming after us.
2080833	2084596	This lawyer, first off, he needs to go up against some of these companies.
2084636	2087479	And we need some of these companies to stand up to him and just say, fuck off.
2087839	2091300	because you're retarded and just fight them and make them lose in court.
2091900	2098743	But then you have the whiny mothers there just, you know, oh my kid, oh my god, he could have possibly been exposed to this.
2099003	2105365	I'm suing you because he might have been exposed to this even though I don't know he was because I wasn't monitoring what he's playing and yeah.
2106886	2113208	One thing though that I like to keep in mind to put all of this into perspective, we are the gaming generation.
2113908	2116249	Our numbers are increasing daily.
2117404	2126166	Before too long, these gamers are going to grow up, and they're going to be the ones having the kids, and we're going to be the ones making the decisions, and we're going to be the ones with the power.
2127927	2134189	Give it 10, 15 years, they're going to be sitting in their wheelchairs going, We lost!
2134289	2136929	The gamers grew up and kicked our asses!
2137530	2138690	Oh yeah, I'm waiting for that.
2139710	2143911	We just have to keep in mind, and I love that we have this format that we can reach so many people.
2144391	2146012	Go out and spread the word, seriously.
2146932	2153195	The next parent you see bitching about this, tell them, hey, look, the FBI says crime has gone down.
2153535	2160798	You need to make sure that you do your research before you start affecting other people's livelihoods by trying to shut them down.
2160858	2166781	These are people trying to earn money and pay for their kids' educations and take care of their families just the same as you.
2168261	2171623	They're doing this because they're selfish and they don't feel like raising their own children.
2172824	2174945	We need more people to get the word out there.
2175005	2175885	Parents, do your job.
2176125	2177706	I'm going to start a campaign right now.
2178166	2180227	Parents, do your fucking job campaign.
2181007	2184829	I'm going to go out there and protest in front of PTA meetings and stuff.
2185169	2185850	I think I should do that.
2185870	2186330	That'd be great.
2187574	2188955	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2205845	2214011	I don't see what the big deal is with, you know, violence or sex in an R-rated movie, which, I might add, is okay for a 17-year-old to go see.
2214672	2215012	Okay?
2215372	2216193	It's okay for that.
2216293	2225100	But you don't ever hear anymore of people going, Oh, well, I brought my kid to that, you know, movie, and there was full-on sex in it.
2225120	2230464	It was rated R. I'm gonna sue you because I didn't know there was sex in this movie.
2231792	2232573	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2255709	2277496	you will go for the extra effort it takes to see what they're getting into before laying down the money because the moment that that money leaves your hand and pays for that game just at that moment not even when you sit your children down to play the game the moment you purchase it that is the moment that you take 100% responsibility for what your child sees you are the only one to blame
2279215	2290161	I think we should just have all parents sign off on a little form when they buy their game that's mature rated that says, I fully acknowledge the content in this game is inappropriate for anybody under the age of 17.
2290461	2301288	Now, I am wholly responsible if anybody under the age of 17 is playing this in my presence and any actions or, you know, that result of them playing this.
2302188	2313875	and then when they go, I didn't know that that game was violent even though big content warnings on the front, I'm going to see you and they're like, fuck you, you signed the contract, shove it up your ass.
2315151	2319115	You know what's funny is that I deal with that daily since I work in the mortgage industry.
2319816	2323179	I didn't know that I had to have insurance on my house.
2323319	2323639	Bitch!
2323980	2324961	You signed that form.
2324981	2326002	You've got to have insurance.
2326442	2326862	Same thing.
2326902	2327963	I think that's a great idea.
2328524	2332688	I think there should be disclaimers that people sign when they buy adult-only and M-rated games.
2333189	2334630	That is a brilliant idea.
2334670	2336872	We should definitely write our congressman to lobby for that.
2337813	2338013	So...
2340095	2346341	And the other thing, too, about Killer7, and I'd like to backtrack a little bit, how they're saying that, you know, this has full-on sex stuff.
2347062	2349544	Before the game even starts, there's a little warning that comes up.
2349705	2354810	This game contains violent content and some nudity.
2355770	2357332	Parental discretion advised.
2357592	2360855	You know, full-on on there, you have to hit a button to go through it, okay?
2362106	2368449	What more do these game companies need to do for you fucking people?
2370170	2372551	What does it take for you to need to do your own job?
2373432	2376813	What do they need to do before you start being responsible?
2378214	2378574	Nothing.
2378634	2379735	There's nothing they can do.
2380255	2386278	You want the government to come in and do your job for you so you can go kick back and get drunk and wasted and stuff and have more kids.
2386318	2388539	Probably the same way you had your kids in the first place.
2389280	2389480	So,
2390822	2401385	What comes down to is, when I have my kids, I'll be watching what they're playing, and honestly, I don't mind if they play the mature games because I'll be teaching them the difference between right and wrong in the first place.
2401685	2408386	And they know that this is a game, it's fictional, it does not play in the real world, it's just like a fantasy movie.
2409267	2409727	The end.
2409807	2410887	That's what it's going to come down to.
2412205	2418167	I really think in the end it really has more to do... You know, also these parents need to give their kids a little bit more credit.
2418607	2421068	Your children are not stupid in most cases.
2421448	2423909	They only become stupid after you teach them how to be.
2424550	2430012	You know, your children are most likely going to know the difference between fiction and reality.
2430412	2435694	And if they don't, then you need to take them to the psychologist or you need to go to parenting school or something.
2436074	2437895	Because then there's some seriously messed up issues.
2438515	2438715	But...
2439255	2457809	you know in the end parents need to give their children a little bit more credit and they need to take more responsibility for what their children do for what their children learn that's called parenting letting the government do it lobbying you know they're spending all this you know it's almost like that episode of South Park you remember with the when they were trying to take Terrence and Phillip off the air
2458970	2483872	and their children were talking about getting into drugs and I hear smoking crack is kind of cute you know and watching porn movies while their parents backs were turned and they were so busy focusing on this one issue you know that's not parenting you need to actually take an active part in your children's lives and say hey this is what I think that they should do this is how I feel they should be raised
2484252	2484933	That's the end of it.
