The following live program is a special presentation of Orange Lounge Radio
On tonight's program, Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 154.
We got a whole lot of Bomani news going on.
There was big stuff, big song pack releases.
Not really song pack, but song list releases of the upcoming games.
That should be a lot of fun.
Also on tonight's show, we have a sneak preview of the brand new Pump It Up game.
And whatever else is on our mind.
Right after this little introduction.
So get your butt in chat room.

Just kidding, she's not here.
She's actually out tonight.
DarkSakura is at the Classic Gaming Expo today.
She's doing a report on Classic Gaming Expo for OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
So she may drop by at the end of the show because she wants to be here for the podcast to fill us in on Classic Gaming Expo.
But she won't be here for a little bit.
So filling in, we have the one and only, since he's sitting in the fluffy green chair, I'm saying he's filling in.
The one and only Miklatov, say hello.
Pause, Meteos, and say hello.
Turn the mic on.
There you go.
It hasn't been that long since you've been here, has it?
A couple of months.
Yeah, a little while.
All right, so I'm sure he'll be telling us a whole lot of nothing tonight because all those stupid NDAs.
So why do we even have you on this show?
I can't remember.
Because I get drunk a lot.
Oh, yeah.
Well, not tonight.
Yeah, what's the point?
I mean, after all, you know, GamePro is just breaking all this news.
What's wrong?
They don't get in trouble for spilling the stuff that they're not supposed to be.
They didn't sign anything.
But GamePro's crappy, so they don't know that it's GamePro.
The one voice over there you hear is the one and only Techmaster Loki.
I am here, and I love bacon.
Yes, you do.
You do love bacon.
All right.
Also joining us tonight, we have other special guests, not just those folks.
We've got the one and only Jazz.
Hi.
How are you?
Wow, that mic's loud.
That's all right.
No, my voice.
That's right.
I'm fine.
Good to hear.
Alright.
Say hello also to the one and only, the guy who turned this show NC-17 last week with a single sentence.
Say hello to my roommate, Extifer.
Yo.
Alright.
Alright, so we're going to take a quick break and then we're going to come back and dish for a little bit.
And all the times I knew we ever would've

I got to play some more games, um, Darkwatch, for, you know, briefly, then I got bored of Darkwatch after about five minutes, just because, you know, first person shooters, eh, I just didn't have the time to dedicate to it, so Burnout 3 it was, because I took down 54 cars in one match, and that was fucking awesome, that was one of the best races I've done, uh, it was just like, I was in the zone, just like, knocking off cars, you know, three at a time, and
You have been obsessed with Burnout 3, just like I have been obsessed with Meteos.
I cannot stop.
And now, Miklatov is obsessed with Meteos.
Well, then also, I got to play actual music games.
I got to play Taiko no Tachigen while I was waiting for Nelly to get out of the doctor's.
On the PSP, you didn't lug the big drum into the doctor's office or anything I do lug my PS2 around though, I do do that And I kid you not, this is how addicted to Burnout 3 I am I will lug my PS2, I carry it with me to work I'll lug it downstairs, we'll hook it up to the TV We'll play two races and unhook it up in a matter of 15 minutes
That's pretty much all I did that was super exciting.
I saw a 40 year old virgin in that movie.
It was hilarious.
I love it.
Highly recommend it.
Was it funnier than There's Something About Mary?
Yeah.
It was one of those movies you actually laugh out loud.
It was just really funny.
Steve Carell is awesome, and all the supporting cast was awesome as well.
So, really good movie.
Comment from the chat room.
Fireboma says, Any game that enables you to produce Final Destination 2 pileups are great.
If you remember the beginning of that movie.
If you want to join our chat...

That's the difference between this show and the podcast, really, is that you get to interact with us.
The thing that pisses me off about Burnout 3, though, is I can't find cheat codes for it.
And, you know, it being on my hard drive, it makes it a little hard to cheat.
There is a way, though, Code Breaker version 9, I guess you can do that, but I have 8, so I have to see if I can upgrade that or something.
I don't know.
But, yeah, it looks like it's going to be really fun, and I'm waiting for Burnout Revenge, because that's next month, so...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
College DJ, okay, that's on MTV, okay?
I think I got my start.
Hey, you're listening to Chico State Radio, and now it's some Beck, and coming up, more Beck!
No, honestly, it's very annoying, and I've turned the announcer off a few times, and he keeps coming back.
and also if you don't play the world race mode right off the bat, you'll keep getting these stupid training videos that pop up and they're like five minutes long and you can't bypass any of them.
That sucks.
And also some of the physics in the game were a little touchy and the AI is a bit too rubber bandy and it's just, I don't know.
But Burnout Revenge, from what I hear, fixes all of that and the game is amazing.
I can't wait.
Because you can also do, I guess...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
That's about it.
That was my life.
And I worked.
You worked a lot this week?
Yes, and I hated it.
I hated it so much.
Don't talk about you don't like it.
Don't say that when Konami people might be listening to this show, you dumbass.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
Based off the original Frogger, and well, it's a Frogger game.
If you can take care of Hawaii, it's all Hawaii.
Let's just go to Hawaii and beat some people up.
Yeah, I mean, it's that simple.
Japan needs to, you know, bomb them again.
Again, for those that don't know Miku Latavi, he actually works at Konami.
Can you
What can you tell us about your job?
He's under a lot of non-disclosure agreements, which means if he says things that he's not supposed to, he gets a spanking and possibly fired.
They should put a little collar around his neck if he says something he's not supposed to.
That transmits back to the home planet.
So what can you say about your job?
Well, okay, people know I do DDR.
And, I mean, if you look at instruction booklets, you see lists of testers and stuff.
And so you see my name there, too.
So, I mean, you can gather that information.
I test and I do DDR and I do other things.
So would it be fair to say and feel free to say you can't answer if you can't?
I can't answer that what?
I didn't even ask!
Is DDR the only game you work on?
No.
No, it's not.
Okay.
Do you work on games other than Bomani games?
Yes.
Okay.
I see.
I see.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
No.
Any songs from any purple-looking games that you can think of?
Oh, you're talking about Beatmania, aren't you?
Yeah.
Okay, hold on.
I can clear this up.
You know about Beatmania?
We don't know anything more than everybody else does.
When we saw those pictures for the first time is when you saw those pictures for the first time.
So it was shocking to us, too.
But IGN saw them before everybody saw them.
I know, they're jerks.
I hate IGN.
What's up?
Can you tell me about this?
What the hell's up with GamePro?
What the hell?
How come they beat you to everything?
They're a nobody, like, pays attention to magazine, so they can say whatever they want.
They need to say something to get some readers, and then they have readers for a day.
Disclaimer, guys.
Miklatov's comments are his own, and do not necessarily reflect those of Konami.
They are wannabe EGM, okay?
GamePro used to be the shit back in the day when it was GamePro and Nintendo Power.
Every day they would walk in and see the big list of the club members and go, Ha ha ha ha ha!
Stupid people!
See, the only thing I remember from GamePro from my childhood is the two covers, the American Gladiators one, and the Gremlins 2 one, and then everything else is a blur.
Because the American Gladiators one.
What's that noise?
Forget it.
I can't remember when I pinched my cheek at the cover.
Forget it.
Forget it.
Rob was trying to save it.
He was masturbating to the cover.
Yeah, when I was nine.
This is what we call a radio gag because they can't see that I'm pulling my cheek.
It sounds over the sound waves.
It sounds like... This is what we do when we don't have...
Soundboards with different audio effects.
We have to make them ourselves.
But still, I was like nine when that cover came out.
So if you're saying that I was masturbating at nine... Dude, some people were!
You know, people can keep magazines.
They don't just disappear.
But it had like laser on the cover.
I didn't even remember who was on the cover.
It was Gemini, laser, and some chick.
Okay!
Those...
Those Farrah Fawcett posters were in guys' bedrooms for like 25 years.
Okay.
They need lives then.
I guess so.
And Loki, what are you talking about that we don't have a soundboard here at the station?
God damn!
Ow, my foot!
Why did I shoot myself in my foot?
Oh, I have something else.
What?
Okay, and a drink.
We were at IHOP today, and we were sitting in the back of the place, because that's where they made us sit.
And so we're having our normal discussions, and Extifer has his little rainbow shirt on, and Justin, I don't know, did you say Jazz or Jazz?
Justin, okay.
Sorry, my bad.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Thanks for watching!
That guy on that radio show said he was gay.
Oh no.
You know, come to think of it, we have an interesting setup tonight because I know, I was like, well wait a second.
Loki's sitting in the center of the room and he's surrounded by a bunch of bags.
Eh, I'm used to it.
What do you mean you're used to it?
What do you mean you're used to it?
What the hell?
We shared an apartment for like two years.
I mean, come on.
So when Rob had his orgies in the middle of it?
I never had orgies.
is the best spot to see the TV.
Loki, hold on.
Hold on to this biscuit, Loki.
Just close your eyes.
Anyway, moving on.
Anything else you want to share about your week?
No.
Okay.
You can go back to Meteos now.
Hooray.
Wait, this is the first time you've played Meteos.
Yeah, really.
This is pretty much the first time I've played it.
Pretty cool, huh?
What did I tell you?
I hate it because there's nothing really to do in it, but then I just got to keep moving the stylus and make blocks fly up, but they fall back down.
So...
This makes me think of a question.
At Konami, are you allowed to play?
Because you get your breaks and lunch.
I'm assuming they don't slave drive you guys too much.
You actually get a break and a lunch.
Oh, yeah.
We play whatever we want.
I play Pump It Up there.
Can you play whatever you want on your breaks?
Oh, it was funny because I was playing Pump It Up and I was talking to somebody that was a little higher up than me.
I was saying how much I like Pump It Up more than DDR.
And then the higher up
for all of us came in and he told him and I had to explain myself.
It was great.
But yeah, I play Pump there.
That's pretty much all I do on breaks.
That's great.
What are other hot games in the office right now that are not Konami made?
Dr. Mario for Nintendo 64.
Kind of random.
I didn't even...
I didn't even know they made Dr. Mario and Tetris 64.
I remember Pokemon Puzzle League, but I don't remember Dr. Mario 64.
Wasn't it like Dr. Mario and Tetris or something?
Oh, that's right.
I'm not sure.
Pump It Up and Forza Motorsport.
That's the ones that get played that aren't Konami games.
You mean you're not playing Enthusia?
Forza Motorsport is what we play there.
Nothing else.
All right.
Oh, and on a, I have to ask, maybe you can't tell me because this is a Konami-related game, but how's the Winx game turning out?
NDA.
Damn you.
Can't tell me shit about DDR, now you can't tell me shit about the Winx?
Winx Club has now been, it's been relabeled as adult only, so, you know.
Yes, I mean, dude, the Winx get topless.
The Winx hot coffee edition.
Honestly, it wouldn't surprise me.
That's all I'll say.
Whoa, hey.
Alright, moving on.
That's what the franchise needs.
Let's go over to Justin.
How was your week?
How was your day, sir?
My week was pretty uneventful.
I played Final Fantasy for most of the week, and when I wasn't playing Final Fantasy, I was starting up school again, which kind of sucks, but it's something to do, so that's good enough for me.
Then on Saturday morning, I drove up here, and we hung out
and we went to IHOP and that was funny with the lesbians because they specifically told me that it was because of my shirt they could tell we were all gay.
Yeah, your shirt made us all gay.
Yes.
That's great.
I love it.
Yeah, because gays aren't allowed to associate with straights in public, only behind closed doors, apparently.
Indeed.
Besides that, that's about it.
All right.
Yep.
Exciting.
Extra for anything you want to share?
My week was really cool, I guess.
I don't know.
I watched a lot of South Park.
I went to work.
I slept.
It was very uneventful, but it was good.
Sometimes, ironically, the boring weeks become the better weeks sometimes.
I have a small little thing to add on to what Christopher just said.
Yeah.
Now, don't ask me why I was watching UPN, but for some reason UPN was on the TV, and apparently UPN is getting South Park now.
And I'm like, what the hell would you want to watch South Park on UPN for?
You wouldn't.
Exactly!
Christopher, what else did you watch that rhymes with the 4400?
Um...
I don't know, maybe you can tell me.
The 4400.
Oh, yeah, that rhymes with 4400.
It's an awesome show.
I'm sorry, I forgot to add that to mine.
Oh, and Shane or Mikla Tav bought me Final Fantasy XI.
You can call him Shane, that's all right.
Oh, Shane, by the way, bought me Final Fantasy XI.
The listeners will just have to draw a chart at home to keep track of, okay, here's their online name and here's their real name.
Oh, okay.
And he got me into Final Fantasy XI.
Hooray, I converted somebody.
I helped.
Oh yeah, and I made Shane watch Mean Girls for the first time and he loved it.
It's an awesome movie.
It's really, really funny.
And today has been cool.
That's good.
I'm glad you're having a cool day.
My week and my day.
Actually, I had a pretty shitty week because I've been sick all week.
You can probably hear it now a little bit.
I know my voice is usually kind of nasal, but especially so tonight because I had a sinus infection this week, so it was pretty bad.
Weird enough, I'm pretty confident that I caught it on my plane ride back from the East Coast.
Thank you very much.
Coming back on the plane.
Yes, coming back on the plane.
I was pretty sure I caught my sinus infection there.
I did not get bit by a mosquito on the plane.
They don't let mosquitoes in planes.
Sorry, the profile of the mosquito matches that of a terrorist.
You cannot board the plane.
You guys.
So I got the sinus infection on the plane, but the symptoms didn't really set in until like Monday night.
So I was really, really sick.
And I went to work anyway because my job is kind of one of those where it's not easy for me to call in sick.
So, Extifer, yes, is reaching for a microphone, yes.
You can so call in sick.
There's so many people that can work for you.
You're just...
I don't know how things are going to be when I get back, and I might be creating more work for myself by calling in sick.
See what I'm saying?
See what I'm saying?
Take care of yourself first.
Whatever.
I took care of myself.
I slept all night.
That's why I have nothing to say about my weight because I slept.
I have to admit, when I go home and I see you in any pose sleeping on the couch, it's fucking hilarious.
Because you look funny when you sleep and you're sick.
Rob would also like to add that he will have something to talk about next week because he has Hello Kitty Roller Rescue.
I did.
Loki didn't buy me, but obtained me a copy through his work.
Not through pirating, actually, but through his work.
Obtained me a copy of Hello Kitty Roller Rescue, so I'm really excited.
And I have a reason to dust off the GameCube, since otherwise the damn thing wouldn't be getting dusted off until 2006.
Yeah, because my work looked at me funny when I was excited to get Hello Kitty Roller Rescue.
I'm all, yeah, I'm all, hey, my friend's gonna love this game.
They're all, right, your friend.
That's great.
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
But I was really missing out on everything else.
But since I was living with Loki for the past couple years up until April, I was able to abuse his US PlayStation 2, so I never had to buy one.
But now that, you know, Extifer isn't quite the gamer I am.
Extifer, do you have any game systems?
What do you... I have a GameCube that I love and that I never play either.
So we let you on the show because you are a gamer, believe it or not.
I have played a video game before.
Okay, that's good.
What are your favorite GameCube games?
Metroid Prime.
There you go.
All right.
Now, what did I tell you to say every time somebody brings up Final Fantasy XI?
Damn those gil-sellers.
Gil-sellers.
Gil-sellers.
There you go.
Them gil-sellers.
They sell gils all the time.
What's a gil-seller?
What's one of the people that sells the currency on eBay and fucks up the economy?
Oh, well, damn them.
There you go.
So you just have a GameCube, nothing else?
I have a GameCube and a Game Boy Advance, and I have PlayStation 2 games, and I don't have a PlayStation 2, but you have one, so hey.
I have one now.
You have a tiny one.
Yes, I bought one of the new minis.
I was going to... Go ahead.
No, no, no, go ahead.
I was going to get an old-style PlayStation 2, but they're kind of hard to find now.
It's because I wanted to put a hard drive in it.
But I just decided, you know, fuck it.
Most PlayStation 2 games are like $20 now, and there's only a few I want to play.
You can still have a hard drive in the mini ones.
How?
Not in it.
Well, USB Advanced.
You can use the USB hard drives.
It supports up to 2TB hard drives, and it'll run just as fast as running off the CD-ROM.
DarkSakura,
Now, too bad you didn't wait, though, because it's dropping down in price to $99.
But not until November.
Yeah, to compete with Xbox 360.
I saved my receipt, just in case.
Hey, Rob.
He has to be killed off.
Those PlayStation 2s aren't new anymore.
They've been out for a year.
They're new to me, because nobody I know has one, except me.
Oh, but they're still not new.
They're new to me.
I don't care if they're not.
Hey, and the Xbox 360 is cool, because it's going to have Final Fantasy XI.
That's why I'm getting it.
Which one did you get?
I'm getting the one that's worth the money, not the one that's a $300 doorstop.
I love how you come on this program to promote non-Kanami games.
Yeah, like Pump.
We'll get to your Pump story, don't worry.
Hooray.
We'll get to that.
So, I bought my US PlayStation 2.
Final Fantasy X Final Fantasy X
One of them.
Are there any British soccer player games that we can talk about?
Because they're downstairs right now, I just saw them outside.
Anyways, I have to go see them again.
Winning 11, you can talk about winning 11.
We can talk about winning 11, I don't know.
Alright, go have fun next to her.
Alright.
Anyway, I guess what we'll do now, why don't we go to a quick break, then we're going to come back and talk about some actual Bomani news, things that are going on in the Bomani world.
Yes, let's.
and then we'll also open up the skype line a little later on in the show so you guys if you have anything you want to ask Miklatov or us you can because I'm sure folks are going to try and get some information on Miklatov even though he ain't going to tell you anything but you can try so we'll open up the skype line for you guys a little later on so if you guys want to be able to call on the show you have to head on over to our skype line www.orangeloungeradio.com and click on interact with us
and meanwhile we'll do some more announced music for DDR Extreme 2.
Started off with a little bit of Boom Boom Dollar.
We'll be back after this.
And the heat of the night, the night And the heat of the night, the night Why did our feelings die in action When we fought for satisfaction But our hearts end at the web Save me
Why, little love, all this magic
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 154 in progress.
We were talking a little bit about our weeks and our days.
Now we're going to talk a little bit about some things that are going on in the Bomani world.
I suppose, even though we've really just beat this topic into the freaking ground over the past few episodes, I think we sort of have to kind of say something about the recent developments in the Konami vs. Roxxor case.
Okay, basically here it is.
I'm just going to give you the short version, then you can say what you want, and we'll be done.
DDR Freak kind of used their account into the government public system, I think it's called PACER or something, to pull the latest documents in the case, because these are all publicly available documents.
It's not, you know, anything that's filed in a court of law, well, almost anything is usually publicly available.
So they basically pulled the official response to Konami's original claims.
Rock Sword responded to those on July 25th, so they went ahead and put those on their site.
And basically, in short, Rockstar says, we deny, we deny, we deny.
We request that Konami's patent on DDR be invalidated.
And that's part of a countersuit, which Rockstar went ahead with doing a countersuit there.
And then Konami responded on August 15th.
Nothing really earth-shaking there, just basically deny, deny, deny, you know, we'll see you in court type thing.
Also posted something called an order for discovery.
Kind of the most interesting thing in there, I think, as it was, because I don't profess to be a lawyer, so I'm not going to try and make sense of these documents.
But the order for discovery has like a timetable of what a possible trial would look like.
Get this, a trial date would be February of 2007.
So this Konami vs. Rocksaur bitching would go on well through, like, Extreme 4 and In the Groove 4.
So, we're screwed either way.
If you want to check this out for yourself, www.ddrfreak.com.
You can check out the original documents posted there.
Loki, did you check this out?
Yeah, briefly.
Yeah.
Please make it so Konami can't use their patents so we can steal it.
Hey, you know what?
In the group, guess what?
Rocks are... There's some modifiers that you don't have yet that are in Pump It Up.
Go steal those now.
would it be stealing though?
because now they're working with Andamira which I think would be really funny if those two companies end up merging shut up right now don't say such horrible things if those two companies end up merging before 2007 how's that going to screw everything up?
there's a little difference here watching you guys play Pump It Up today versus watching In The Groove it's like night and day the videos in Pump It Up
Phenomenal, the videos in the group.
There's videos in the group?
No.
Yeah, it's just some random crap.
Just the whole step charts, you know, that's, you know, granted, Pump It Up has some really retarded ones, like 17, you know, difficulty stuff, which, you know, in the group, you know, they're falling behind here.
I mean, they're a little ahead of you.
So, I don't know.
To be honest...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
and it has more songs and it's red.
I haven't gone to check it out but I have a good excuse because the arcade it's at is right on the same area or right on the same lot as the state fairgrounds and the state fair is going on right now so you can't get a parking space anywhere near the arcade so forget it.
I'm not going to pay ten dollars to go freaking park in the state fair parking lot and go to go play in the group two of all things.
I mean, oh yeah.
Even though I try not to
I just don't care anymore.
I really don't.
The game sucks.
That's the way I think.
You know, you love it.
Good.
You like crap.
Big deal.
I mean, you know what?
There are people that like crap out there.
I mean, I like bad movies.
Some people say, what the hell's wrong with you?
But, you know, I like bad movies.
I mean, what the hell?
So, if you like, you know, inferior games, if you think it's fun, hey, good.
It's your niche.
Obviously, someone's buying them, so somebody out there likes them.
Good.
Um,
Miklatov, now I know you really, really probably can't comment on these, because especially in your position, you'd be in a world of hurt, but is there anything you do want to say?
I'm taking off my Konami hat for a second.
Okay.
Okay, in the groove is stupid.
When I read the countersuit, I thought, you know, wow, you know, Rockstar's really taking a chance with four-year-old lawyers.
Actually, apparently, no, no, wait a minute, apparently now in the, um, uh,
I once went to a trial
But he says in the article that the Roxxor legal team is actually a pretty well-respected group from the Bay Area.
In the park, you know, in the little sandbox, when they have their little shovels and tails.
No, I'm sorry.
Everything Loki said is how I feel.
It's inferior, and Roxxor's just whiny because they want money off somebody else's game.
Now, wait a minute, though.
Here's...
I promised myself I wouldn't get into another lawsuit discussion, but I don't care.
I have you here, so.
Okay.
RockSore, you can look at as like the big corporate evil people that just want money.
They're not big.
Think about the people that actually made In The Groove, the team that actually made it before it got absolved into RockSore.
These guys were DDR fans that just took their obsession to a really extreme level.
Yeah, and you know what?
They could have kept it kind of on the download and small and not distribute it and sold it for money and tried to say, oh, it's better and oh, we're so cool.
We have somebody that uses different aliases also and all the songs sound the same.
You know, good or bad, okay?
Good or bad, whether whatever you think of in the group.
Let's put it this way.
DDR, okay?
If they were still making more mixes for the arcade, this would not have even been made.
And this game itself is so... I don't even know how they're saying that this is not even copyrighted on Dances Revolution.
Honestly, they changed everything, or what they thought they needed to change, so they wouldn't get sued.
That is all.
Otherwise, it is an exact duplicate of DDR.
Yeah, and what makes it better is, oh, Indie Groove 2 has DDR songs.
You know what's going to be interesting?
Yeah, I know.
I always thought that's very weird.
Why are they trying to copy DDR?
It's like, hey, we're getting away with this.
Now we're just going to put your songs in here, too, and make quote-unquote better steps.
Here's the interesting thing, though.
Imagine this.
Whether you're on the in-the-group side or on the DDR side or on the don't-give-a-shit side, picture this.
The jury trial that might happen if they don't settle might happen in 2007.
They're going to show a jury these two games.
This jury will not have a DDR or In The Groove fan on it, no matter what.
Because if people consider themselves a fan of that game, the lawyer from the opposing side is going to boot them off the jury, no question.
So there will not be any DDR or In The Groove fans on this jury.
You show somebody who isn't familiar with these dancing games these two games side by side.
They'll be like, that's the exact same game.
That's just all... Just draw your own conclusions.
Picture that.
That's where this could be headed.
That's why I'm kind of...
Surprise that we're not talking settlement yet, but maybe that's still a few months off.
They've got to whip their dicks out in the legal sense first.
I've heard some rumblings that's going to kind of change things from not the Konami side.
Oh, I was like, don't say too much.
No, no, no, no.
It has nothing to do with Konami.
Okay.
Yeah, if what I've heard goes through, I don't even know what's going to happen after that.
Interesting.
Yeah.
Very interesting.
Okay.
And I don't want it to go through.
at all.
Bye-bye.
That rumor's been going around ever since Andomero published.
Well, you know, I would rather see Andomero take on, you know, in the groove and actually be able to develop it, because obviously it looks like their programmers and game designers know what the fuck they're doing versus these guys.
I mean, these guys may have taken, you know, an okay direction, but Andomero's going to be the ones going to put the polish on things.
But the weird thing, if Andomero were to absolve Rockstar or whatever, Andomero and Konami kind of have that
They pay money to put out games.
Yeah, the games can coexist.
They basically have that these games can coexist agreement, whatever that may be.
That's why it's going to be weird.
Well, you know, it's weird, but hey, if they want to, you know, draw a truce or whatever, I'm fine with it.
You know, a little healthy competition never hurt anybody because it'd be an easy win for DDR, but you know.
So you're okay with In The Groove being out there and making new mixes?
I'm fine with it being out there.
If I don't like the game, I don't play it.
That's pretty simple.
I mean, it's not like I'm forced to play it when I walk into an arcade.
So, you know what?
I've played worse.
I've played worse games out there.
Hell, I've played a lot of dancing games that have just... I played that one game that was like Itoy Groove, okay?
That was an arcade game.
I mean, that game... I Can Dance?
Or I Can Boogie?
I Can Boogie.
That game sucks ass, okay?
This is...
In a whole new dimension of crap, okay?
That In The Groove would never ever be able to touch.
And I've played Dance Station 3DDX, which is really interesting.
You know, that one's a real weird game, but I found it to be pretty fun.
So, who cares?
Put another game out there.
Give some people some choice, you know?
Alright, alright.
Extifer, Justin, anything you guys want to say about this whole thing?
Nothing?
Nothing?
Xtifer's like, I don't know what you're talking about.
What do you think, Xtifer?
Well, okay, I'm actually curious of your perspective.
Have you seen the In the Groove game at all?
I did see it at the bowling alley.
Okay, now you're someone who doesn't...
I'm curious, as somebody who is not a hardcore fan of these two games, what do you think?
Is one game a rip-off of the other?
Um...
I think that in the groove game looked a lot like DDR.
I mean, it looked like the other game, but the only difference was they had those bombs or mines or whatever.
That was the only difference.
It basically was DDR.
I don't know.
That's what I thought.
See, now that could be what a jury member is going to think.
Isn't that interesting that I just said that?
Yes, it was riveting.
Thank you.
Well, sometimes I think folks that are hardcore fans of either In The Groove or DDR, you know, and have too much of a one-track mind where they only see the stuff they want to see in the games.
They don't kind of think that, oh, if this really does go to court, an unbiased jury is going to take a look at it and, you know, have their say.
All right.
Enough lawsuit chat.
I'm done.
I don't know why somebody would want that, but... No.
Do you know Noria?
Are you on a first name basis?
Like Sana and Togo and all them, they just walk around the office all day, right?
Maybe in Japan.
I mean, we occasionally get people in our office.
I don't ever remember seeing Noria.
And if I did, she'd probably come at me all crazy.
You have to understand that Naoki keeps a close eye on his harem, okay?
They don't leave Japan.
I remember the year that Akira Yamaoka came to E3 and you were just as excited as I was.
And I stalked him.
Three pictures.
That's great.
Anyway.
Let's do this.
Let's go ahead and... Actually, let's move to the Pump It Up topic since we were kind of getting into that a little bit and then we'll open up the skyline after another break.
Pump It Up...
Now, we actually, this game's not going to be out.
What's the official name of the game here we're looking at for Pump It Up?
Pump It Up Exceed Home?
Pump It Up Exceed.
Pump It Up Exceed.
The home release is coming out the 31st.
We got a copy, though, or I should say, Miklatov got a copy.
Now, don't forget to turn on your mic.
Heck yeah, I got a copy!
How did you get a copy?
Okay, it's a great story.
Was it through sources at Konami?
No, no.
Secret Andomero agreements where they share games with each other?
After work one day, I was like, hey, I want both pump-it-ups for Xbox and PS2 when they come out, because I know they're different.
I better go to EB and pre-order them.
So I went in there and I pre-ordered it, and the guy was like, hey, we got one traded in today, even though it's not out.
Do you want it?
I was like, heck yeah, I want it!
So I bought it.
How does someone trade something in if it's not out yet?
I don't even question that.
Is that DDR Stream 3?
Okay.
They're like, yeah, it doesn't come with the pad, and we're still charging you the price as if it were coming with the pad, but do you want it?
And I was like, I'll have it a month early.
Yeah, I'll take it.
So I'm just going to trade it in when it actually comes out.
But yeah, I've had the game since about the beginning of August.
XBOX Ver.
PS2
XSEED Arcade XSEED Arcade
and we also gained some of the revival songs from Exceed 2, which is random.
They censored a couple of the Spanish songs, which makes no sense to me, and that's about the only differences.
Okay, so tell us about, like, the unlock.
How do you unlock songs in the games?
I have no clue.
I've been playing that game since the beginning of August.
I've unlocked four songs now, or, okay, three, and then Justin unlocked one today, and, I mean...
If you think about it, there are four modes.
And to play songs in certain modes, like, say, I want to play... What's a song?
I want to play Chicken Wing in survival mode.
Okay.
Well, it's not unlocked in survival mode, so I have to play it in home mode just to unlock it.
And so I had to go through the game pretty much and play every song in every mode just to make sure that every song appeared in every mode.
And I don't even have that still!
So I've pretty much played over 400 songs, and I've only unlocked four songs.
But, along the way, you also unlock modifiers.
So, I mean, I've not been totally bored out of my mind playing the same songs over and over again.
I get random cool modifiers that are weird.
I like the one that was coming from the corner.
Yeah, exceed modifier.
It's very hard to read.
There's also one where it comes from the bottom middle and just kind of throws it all the way up and then to the side.
It also has something like break and something like wave.
It has random velocity.
You can change the arrow skins.
But, yeah, it's a pretty mean game to try to unlock songs in.
There's also a boobs and ass video.
Yeah, I mean...
I just thought I'd put that in there right there.
This game got a T rating, and you know, it censored two Spanish words, but there's a lot of breasts.
Lots and lots of breasts.
I don't understand it.
Like, not bare breasts.
No, but I mean, they smack her in the chin when she moves.
The whole video is about her breasts.
There's a lot of videos that look like internet flash videos out there, but... They're really funny.
Well, you know what, though?
I thought... One thing that really impressed me, really, really impressed me about Pump It Up Exceed on PlayStation 2 was the fact that every song had a unique video.
It wasn't some type of loop video, like all these little clips kind of looped over and over again.
It was like each one...
Rapper's Delight
and some of the actual music videos for actual songs Little Less Conversation Little Less Conversation, Name of the Game, and Walkie Talkie Man which is the stupidest song ever on Crazy it's a 17 tell us about where In The Groove might have gotten some of its inspiration from Pump It Up what?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
On Xbox Live, I don't know, it's just kind of weird.
Yeah, but I'll be happy because I can finally make steps to like songs that only have one set of steps.
And that's not even one set of steps for freestyle and normal, it's just like they only have normal steps.
And that's it, and they're like a two.
So, it's actually, the Xbox One is probably going to be the best one with song packs and that downloadable step editor.
Now, song packs on the Xbox One are going to be a little more expensive though, right?
Yeah, I don't think it's actually been officially announced, but they were tossing around the idea of $7 for three songs.
However, it would include licenses.
So, I mean, it's not like you're going to get... Hopefully, it's not like you're going to get just Banya songs.
You'll also get, like, I Hope to Goodness, Luzanka, or Fairy Boat, or Black Cat, or all those really cool songs from the really old games that don't show up anymore.
I was pissed off that Run to You was not in the song list.
Although the game does have a very impressive song.
Yeah, it's really amazing.
I couldn't believe it.
Alright, so...
Sum up the PlayStation version of Pump It Up Exceed, the good stuff and the bad stuff, and do you recommend it?
The good stuff is that it's Pump It Up, and it's the superior dancing game.
The bad stuff is that Mad Catz makes the pad, and that some of the steps are just utter crap, because there's no reason Walkie Talkie Man should go to every last little noise in the whole song.
Alright, the end.
I would say, I think that the game is...
Pretty good looking.
I think it's got a huge song list.
I love the fact that there's a unique video for every song.
I think it's just kind of a fun game.
I think some of the songs are kind of a little, like especially some of the Banya songs are a little average.
Yeah, Banya is very hit or miss, at least in my eyes.
But the K-pop stuff is pretty rad.
Oh, the K-pop stuff is great, and so is the pop because it's a lot of Latin songs.
And the regular pop stuff is cool.
So I was very surprised by Pump It Up Home Version.
I've gone from probably just not really interested in picking it up to I definitely want to pick this game up.
I think it's going to be really good.
However, the bad things about the game.
The interface still annoys the shit out of me.
I hate Pump's interface with the passion, and it is no better in XSEED.
Well, the thing is, it's based off the arcade one, and the arcade one has no, like, left and right buttons, so you have... Still sucks.
They could have done something else, I just, I hate the way you put in codes, I, bleh, sucks.
Well, that's why you can play in home mode, and then you can hold the triangle button down and just...
Always piss me off.
Anyway, it's not just that.
I just don't like the huge wheel that takes forever to get around.
I don't know.
That's just me.
It is.
I don't care.
Justin, what do you think?
Because I know you're a long-time DDR fan.
What do you think of Pump It Up on PlayStation?
I was very much like you when I first heard about it.
I was like, oh, it's Pump It Up.
I've seen that so many times at MGL and Swiggle, the local arcades.
and I just do not care.
Spiegel doesn't have it anymore.
MGL took it.
Let me fix that.
Okay, sorry.
That's my local arcade.
Anyways, but after playing it on Shane's copy, I found it was amazingly fun.
I love the fact that the videos are all fun and not just looped animations and they all have a sense of humor to them for the most part.
XBOX Ver.
Yeah, it looks like a great game.
Right?
Extifer, what little you saw of the game, what do you think of Pump It Up?
You know, I saw it as much as you did, I think.
Oh, I guess that's true.
I thought you left the room for some reason.
Okay.
Yeah, it seems like a game that I'll watch you play occasionally, you know?
I won't play it because I, you know, really suck at those games and it just looks really, I don't know, hard to play.
The End
I call bullshit until I play on one myself.
We'll see though.
Fine, whatever.
All right.
We're going to go to a break, you guys, and when we come back, we're going to take your calls on the Skype line.
We'll also talk a little bit about the tiny news we had in the... Well, actually, it was kind of major, but I think most of you guys have read about this by now, the Extreme 2 song list, as well as Karaoke Revolution.
Some song lists showed up for that as well.
So we're going to talk about all that when we come back from this break, and taking your calls on the Skype line, www.
OrangeLoungeRadio.com
Thank you for watching!
Thank you for watching!
Thank you for watching!
Thank you for watching!
Thanks for watching!
Orange Lounge Radio, Mamani Music, and more.
Orange Lounge Radio, back at you here.
In that break, you heard a little bit of Sylvia Drive, Ninth Style, Injection of Love, Red, Inazuma, Happy Sky, Everyday Lovely Day, Eighth Consumer.
What are you booing Everyday Lovely Day for, Miglitov?
It's not a crappy song.
You're a crappy song.
All right.
We're going to open up the old Skype lines right now and take your calls here on our program.
If you'd like to call us, www.orangeloungeradio.com and click on Interact With Us.
Miklatov, I did get a question from somebody who is not able to call us on the Skype line.
Well, then they're losers.
But had a question.
It's Rene.
Well, I might not answer it then.
Well, Rene had a question.
What is it?
I need to ask you.
All right.
Basically, what he wants to know, is Konami doing anything...
for the fan requests on DDR Freak for new stuff, like new mods, new features in DDR, maybe songs.
When he says new mods, he's saying things like, you know, Wave, those types of things.
Has there been an official request for fan requests?
So, in other words, has there been something on DDR Freak asking you to say things?
I don't believe I've seen one in a little while.
Well, then, they're just requesting stuff that's not being heard.
Alright, alright, I gotcha.
Bye, John!
Alright.
Anyway.
Oh, goody!
The gay-straight ratio has gotten worse!
My friend John just showed up, so he's here now to further surround Loki.
We will make you gay by end of show.
No, I'm kidding.
I do have to say, though, I honestly don't know.
Usually when Konami wants to listen or really cares to listen, you'll see like a huge thread devoted to, oh, Konami's asking us to, you know, say, put this song in, so please list your songs you want in.
Do people now...
You don't have power over what goes in the game.
Do people that have the power to change what's in the game, do they read DDR Freak and those types of things?
I don't know who would actually have the power to change the game.
Yes, they do.
So keep making those pointless threads!
They love it when you make a, please put in Sakura, or please put in, what's another crappy song?
A crappy song!
Butterfly!
Oh, yeah, Cartoon Heroes.
Alright.
So keep making those pointless threads on DDR Freak with your requests, and maybe somebody from Konami will give a crap.
So we'll see.
Yeah, when we laugh at it.
You know what's going to happen?
When the head of PR or whatever is coming out to our company to speak about their games and stuff, I'm just going to say, can you put Sakura in the next one?
I have a controversial question for you.
I'm playing Meteos, what is it?
Do people at the office make fun of DDR Freak posts?
I have openly admitted I do.
Everybody knows I'm the jerk.
So, I mean, oh, last year, remember the extreme thread?
That was a big joke, it was fun.
You know what you need?
You need a giant plotter printer so you can print the thread or whatever the post is.
Super big on the wall so that you can laugh at it.
You know, you can just have, like, wallpaper on the wall with really bad posts from DDR3.
Ooh, I'm going to do that in my game room if I ever get one.
How come you guys didn't do clues this year?
I can't really say.
Oh, okay.
That's that.
That's all GamePro's fault.
All GamePro.
I got served.
Yeah, it's all GamePro's fault.
Let's go to a call.
Hello, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.
Hello, my friend.
What's on your mind?
Well, let me see.
Just, you know, going through the usual on a Sunday.
Me heading out to Long Island to play 2DX and breaking another in the group machine in the city.
Oh, that reminds me.
I have news for you because you were wanting me to come to the Digital Life Expo and you're actually not the only person on the East Coast who wanted me to come out there.
I'm having a meeting with my boss next week to negotiate trying to get the time off to make that happen.
I already have a place to stay if I come out there, so...
The plan is being set in motion.
I was serious last week.
I'm going to try and make it happen.
So, we'll see.
It all depends on... If anything, if you're still having problems with like, you know, finding a place to stay for other people, there's this cat named, you know, Sketch on the New York forums.
He's usually very... He usually offers his apartment for people who are actually going to be in the tournament.
So...
Don't take my word for... I mean, don't say I, you know, don't say I was, you know... Wait a minute, you... You want me to stay at the house of a complete internet stranger?
No, but I've already met him on... What if he rapes me or something?
That would be... You would feel bad.
You wouldn't feel anything.
But he's very generous.
I'm teasing, I'm teasing.
I'm sure this guy's great.
It would just be like you sitting down... Expert, shut the hell up.
Beans, can you spill for us about any more Konami stuff that you might know that's unclassified?
Unclassified Konami stuff that you might know, Miklatov.
Put down Minios for one goddamn minute, Jesus.
I like the demo.
Any unclassified Konami stuff that you can speak of.
Unclassified?
You know, things that won't get you fired for your NDA.
Well, I take lunch at, like, between 1 and 3.
So that's not going to get me fired.
That's making sense besides you.
What?
What was that?
Who else is making steps beside you?
Sorry, you got to excuse the retainer.
Can you say that?
Who else is making steps beside you?
I won't name names, but if you look at the instruction booklet for Ultramix 2, the names pretty much haven't changed.
Extreme 2 Are the chefs going to be horrible?
I just hope they're challenging too, because I don't want to be forced to make an edit.
Well, nobody's forcing you.
You could go play in the groove, and then you could use your hands and your feet and your butt and your head and your neighbor.
Now, now, now, if you want some additional... Just so you can hit all the arrows.
Wait for the game to come out, Taku, then you can start the shit-talking.
If you want some hard stuff, you gotta play the eye-tway stuff.
Hands and feet mode is where it's...
I've done enough.
I think I've injured my hand just playing in the groove trying to do the holds.
I got a little bruised.
a wee bit of a letdown for some fans.
It was just crap, that's it.
No, no, Xtreme was good.
Most of the sets to the licenses were crap.
Hold on, Zaku, don't interrupt me.
Alright, don't interrupt me.
Does Xtreme 2 make up for the things that tick people off about Xtreme 1?
First of all, I think those people are whiners.
There's no reason that I thought they were decent steps.
Wait a minute, though.
The fact that Konami held back, you know, on Xtreme, they held back...
Zaku, I will hang up on you.
Hold on, I'll get back to you in a minute.
Alright, which was the better game last year, Ultramix 2 or Extreme?
Ultramix 2, everybody knows that.
Okay, well then there you go.
I'm just defending Extreme, because people belittle it because it wasn't the Japanese one.
Oh my god, the steps are too easy because they're not 12s.
I think people were a little harsh on Extreme, but it did have its issues.
Yeah, I know, I know.
Maximizer was cool.
Interface, we all know that that's better now.
Songlist, we've seen hecka more transplants from Xtreme, like, you know, Irresistible Man, La Copa De Vida, all those Xtreme songs you wanted are in Xtreme 2.
Cartoon Heroes, hello.
The fact that they nailed, you know, they nailed Silence was pretty much it.
Your phone's ringing.
Yes, I know, so I'm going to wrap this up right now.
Bottom line is this, I just hope Xtreme 2 is a lot better than Xtreme.
It is.
Duly noted.
I've got to get this call.
Take care, Cool Cat.
Alright.
Go get that phone, don't be rude.
Alright, I'm trying to read what's going on in the chat room here.
Alright.
Are the steps going to still suck because you're working on them?
Oh, burn, yeah.
I have stuff I wasn't proud of in 2, and I have stuff I'm not proud of in other things.
As long as Konami of Hawaii can learn how to cut songs, you know, actually be able to edit them like, I don't know, Skulk, for example...
You know, as much as I thought I hated the edit for Skulk, I don't mind it anymore because there's... I don't think I'd want to be dancing to... Dancing?
Stepping on arrows to the part where he sings a lot, just because I don't think it would be that fun.
Granted, it was the same thing over and over again for the first episode.
I like the cut of Skulk, so you shut up.
Alright.
Damn, now I forgot the question I was going to ask.
I don't know what it was either.
Was it Meteos related?
Because that's what I'm doing.
No, it's not Meteos related.
It's back on Extreme.
I'm sorry to make you talk about work.
At least I'm not asking you about you know what.
What was I going to say about Extreme?
Oh, I don't know if you can answer this, so feel free to tell me you can't if you can't.
But we all know one of the reasons why people loved Ultramix 2 is because
DDR fans like yourself and other DDR fans who now work for Konami were responsible for the steps.
Extreme USA didn't have that.
Does Xtreme 2, now we all are assuming Ultramix 3 has it because you all worked on Ultramix before.
Does Xtreme 2 now have the influence of those same DDR fans?
I really can't say.
I knew that.
You just wanted to go back to Meteor pretty much.
So online stuff, are we going to, you know, is online going to be like pretty neat?
Are they going to do the same stuff they did with Ultramix 2 with Xtreme 2?
I can't say.
If it's not been in the press release, I really can't say anything about that.
It has been in the press release.
I just can't remember it.
Thank you for watching!
I don't see any more calls coming in.
Actually, you know, you could also go to MobyGames.com.
Credits for Ultra Mix 2 are listed there to see who worked on it.
If you don't actually have Ultra Mix 2, which if you don't, well, you're stupid.
Yeah, it was like five bucks at Walmart a couple weeks ago.
I saw some thread on DDR Free.
Yeah, I think that was a lie.
Was it?
I think that person was just stupid.
Bastard.
That's our most people on DDR Free.
Hey, watch it.
I have friends who are at DDR Freak.
They know I love them.
We have our lovely rewinds we do over on DDR Freak on Friday nights.
I forgot to pause Meteos.
I died.
That's what you get.
Seriously, this show is probably the most we've gotten out of Shane all year, and that's really not that much.
It really hasn't been that much.
We get more out of him if he is drunk.
Yeah, I know.
Anybody got some alcohol?
John, you're here now.
Go get him some alcohol.
John's gonna go get him some alcohol.
I'm not drinking tonight.
I have work tomorrow.
It'll be fine.
No, I'll punch somebody in the face if I'm hungover.
Didn't you say you were immune to alcohol now?
I say we test it.
I say we don't.
I say we do.
Yeah, see, I might have to throw up a lot or something.
Hurry up and call.
If you're thinking about calling, now is a good time to call because we're moving on.
Talk about...
D.R.
Extreme 2 Against All Odds As The Rush Comes

That's what I said.
I don't know.
You said Feet.
Well, that's what I read on here.
Well, you know, DDR, use your feet.
Shut up.

Seeger, can you tell me if it sucks as bad?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I switched your name all of a sudden.
Miggletop, I went retro, 2004.
Miggletop, can you tell me if Oops, I Did It Again is better than the one in Fifth Mix?
Yes, by far.
Alright, good.
Play That Funky Music, WG featuring Tony L. Pump Up The Volume, MARRS.
Silence, the Airscape remix.
Delirium featuring Sarah McLachlan.
Speed Over Beethoven by Rose, Spin Spin Sugar, Armand's Dark Garage Mix by The Sneaker Pimps, Wonderful Night by Fatboy Slim, and You Gotta Move It by Yuzo Koshiro.
Somewhere in my history, I have the sound clips of some of these songs that...
Is this some of the full songs here?
What do we have here?
Here's a clip of My My My by Arman Van Helden.
Here's a little clip of that song if you haven't heard this yet.
That's the beginning.
Let me put it in the middle.
Wow, I picked the worst part of the song.
Here we go.
Alright, here's a little clip of Motorcycle with As The Rush Comes.
This song also going to be in DDR Extreme 2, USA.
Let's see if we can get some vocals here.
Let me skip to another part of the song.
You know, I think I have this CD.
I think you did, I think you did.
Delirium, of course, God, if you guys haven't heard this song, get out of your cave.
This is the particular remix of Silence that's going to be in DDR.
Alright, that should be loads of fun.
There's some little clips there for you guys.
Alright, um...
and let's see if you guys want to look at those sound clips for yourself I'm going to be so kind as to post a website where those songs are so go look them up and it's actually the full songs so if you want to listen to them the full songs are there so www.orangeloungeradio.com click on chat and I just posted the link right there if you guys want to check that out but don't stop listening to us because we have the Orange Lounge Radio cage match to take care of does that sound like a plan?
sounds like a plan alright
And even DarkSakura submitted a song to Cage Match tonight, even though she's not here yet.
Alright, the way the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match works, we're going to play three songs for you guys, one as chosen by each host of Orange Lounge Radio, and the winning song will go into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's Bomani Music and More program, featuring DDR and video game music all week long.
So, Loki won the cage match last week, and Loki, what was the name of your song?
Um, it was... Something from, uh, Wave of, or Wipeout.
It was Wipeout Pure, um, it was like, on, wasn't it like Onyx with something, um, god, I can't remember what the name of the song was.
I'm still looking for it, I gotta find this here somewhere.
I, I just don't remember, it was a cool song though.
Well, I hope so, because... Well, I don't remember the title.
I just remember, hey, it's a song from Wipeout, you know?
Well, that's not good, because I can't find it suddenly.
Do you have your drive?
I think it began with an A. I can't remember.
Do you have your drive, by chance?
Nope, I don't.
Oh, we're fucked.
No, we're not.
Search by Modified.
It'll pull it up.
X-Files meets X-Men, so it's really cool.
I love it and I'm crazy addicted to it.
And you can go buy the first season on DVD for $20.
Where at?
Any place that sells that DVD.
For $20?
For $20.
I got mine at Fry's, but I saw it at Suncoast today.
It's still $20.
And it's worth it.
Not to make fun of, shut up, John.
It's a really good show.
Thanks for watching!
All righty, that was song number one in tonight's cage match, last week's winner after having to dig that one up.
That was Cold Storage with Onyx.
Will it win for another week in a row?
We'll find out.
But first, we have to put it up against two brand new songs.
So the second song in tonight's cage match is going to be my pick.
And you guys remember DJ Sammy, he was really huge a couple years ago with that song Heaven, you know.
And it was in DDR Extreme, DDR Max 2 and everything, so I know you guys know it.
Well, he has a brand new single out, brand, brand new single, and it's another cover.
So guess what song he decided to take a spin on this time.
It's actually an old Annie Lennox song.
It's his version of Why, and it's my pick for tonight's Cage Match, song number two.
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
Y by DJ Sammy
Why?
The part where she's doing the ad-lib vocal stuff, not the refrain.
Where she's rapping?
Sorta, I guess, rapping.
That just totally did not work at all.
It was really bad in that sense.
And DJ Sammy needs to make some new songs that are not covers.
Please, please, please.
Or pick some better 80s stuff.
I mean, there's plenty of songs out there, you know.
Personally, I like, you know, West End Girls.
You know, that's a good song.
They did a really cool breakbeat version of it.
Awesome.
But, um, that wasn't quite awesome.
It was about 7.
Alright.
Miklatov, what did you think of that one?
He's got his own mic.
Alright, hand him that one, that one.
Um...
Yeah, I didn't really care for this song because I was playing Meteos.
I still, I heard it though earlier today and it's okay, but I, oh crap, I forgot to pause.
I give it a four.
Alright, Justin.
I give it a six because like Loki, I really was not digging the part where she was just kind of talking the song and not
I don't even like Annie Lennox that much.
She's like a weird fucking red-headed bitch.
But she's British!
I thought you liked that!
You know, I like Imogen Heap because she's cool and British, but Annie Lennox is weird.
I don't know, like, I didn't like the original song, so I didn't care for this one either.
It's a scale of 1 to 10?
Is that what it is?
Yes.
Okay, 1.
John!
For your debut on the show, John.
Wow, this is kind of scary.
What'd you think?
I was kind of bored with it, to be honest.
I give it a 3.
Alright.
And I give that song... I agree, the girl rapping was kind of weird, and it doesn't hold a candle to the Annie Lennox original, but it makes me think about the Annie Lennox original and why I love that red-headed bitch from the Eurythmics.
So I give it a 20.
Alright, let's go to the next song.
This is... You're a red-headed bitch, that's why.
This is DarkSakura's pick.
She put a song in tonight's cage match.
Even though she's not here tonight, she's actually in chat.
She just joined the chat room, so you guys can say hi to her over there.
I think she'll be here in a little while before podcast.
I think she's supposed to be anyway.
We'll see.
But she put this song in for you guys.
It's an old favorite.
It's Hamasaki Ayumi with Fly High.
And it's Hal's 2000 mix.
So here it is, you know her, Ayumi Hamasaki, what?
What are you shaking your head for over there, Loki?
Let's play the song!
Alright, here we go.
Ayumi Hamasaki, Fly High, Hal's 2000 Mix, here it is.
and the rest of the band.
Thank you for watching!
and many more.
Thank you for watching!
Thank you for watching
Alrighty, that was song number three, Ayumi, the one and only, with Fly High, Hal's 2000 mix.
Let's go around and see, on a scale of one to ten, where that song lies for the folks in our studio right now.
Loki.
Loki.
You know, I want to start off by saying that it was generic trance, but, um... You're gonna get punched next week.
But, you know what?
That was just a clusterfuck of... No!
No!
No!
Bad song.
Bad.
Bad.
Bad song.
One.
I'm sorry.
It was awful.
And then I thought it was gonna end, and I was like, oh, thank God.
It came back, and I was like, no!
Wow, very, very bad.
I, you know what, me personally, I don't get to go to the last, we gotta go in the same order.
Shane, you're up next.
Okay, my first comment when that song was playing, and we didn't have microphones on, was, wow, I didn't know Inuyasha was over, because it sounds like an anime song that I don't care about.
Um, one, because I don't understand the love of Japanese singers and how they're so cool, and Ayumi Hamasaki, and
All right.
Well, let's see.
Let's move on.
Justin.
Even though it was a complete clusterfuck of a different, like, it went through rap, it went through happy J-pop, it went through generic trance, and it went through hard trance, I still kind of liked it.
So I give it a seven.
All right.
Extover.
Damn those guild sellers.
I got it right that time, right?
Yeah, you did, but that's not the topic.
Oh, I'm sorry.
The song was so boring, I forgot.
Oh, no, I love Jamie, so I'm going to give it a five just for that.
Okay.
John.
I'll just say that Loki's song was my favorite.
Oh, okay.
That's not a number on a scale of one to ten.
DarkSakura is actually listening and she would like to say the following.
Mine gets an 8 and not a 10 because it's still generic trance.
So at least she's acknowledging that it's a wee bit of generic trance.
You know what?
That's my favorite Ayumi song, is Fly High.
So I was pretty excited there.
The only parts I didn't like about that song were the very beginning, and the very end, and the middle.
But like...
Not everything in the middle, like the rap in the middle I didn't like, but I liked the first two minutes around the beginning, and I liked the last two minutes after the rap.
So if we could cut, like crop the song, it would be really, really good.
But because it's not cropped, I have to give it a 7.
So, Loki, you have a...
It sounded like the end of a 2DX song.
I can't think for the life of me which song... Big Voyager.
Big Voyager, okay.
Yeah, completely ripped those public... I'm sure they're royalty-free samples.
They're available on some CDs somewhere because everybody uses them.
I have some of them, so I know.
All right, kids.
Get ready to place those votes.
Here's a recap of the three songs you can vote for in tonight's cage match.
Song number one is Cold Storage with Onyx.
And song number two you can vote for tonight is DJ Sammy with his Annie Lennox cover of Why.
And song number three you can vote for tonight is Hamasaki Ayumi, Fly High, Howl's 2000 Mix.
Place vote now.
Do you like how I got the big Voyager clip in there?
Place vote now.
Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.
Jamie, I'm already going to tell you, your vote doesn't count.
I'm sorry to say.
All right.
You know what?
It kind of reminded me, like, parts of that Ayumi song reminded me of, like, a Max Ayumi or something like that, you know, because they have the clips of, like, some hard techno stuff, and then it went back into Ayumi.
It's just kind of weird.
Yeah, it was interesting.
It was interesting.
It was interesting.
All right, this is the part of the show where I let Loki talk about what's going on in the sim scene.
Well, I'm sure there's something going on at Tourney Mix 6, but I haven't checked, so it's going on.
then there's also the important thing because we're talking about quality sim files now is actually FoonMix 2 they have a date for it now when it's going to be coming out September 15th and they've announced some of the compilations they're going to be pulling from from you know diverse system stuff to Silly Walker stuff and they're basically I think they mentioned like D7 which was some really good stuff in there and then some of the Silly Walker Gotta Mix 3 or something like that
Really good songs.
So, it'll be interesting.
I think they said over 50 songs.
50 new songs.
So, I can't wait.
It looks to be fun and we'll have to check it out on the 15th.
Alright.
Justin, I know you follow the sim scene a little bit too.
Is there anything you want to add?
Because Loki tends to miss things.
Yeah.
Actually, one of my favorite personal Simphile authors, the DWI Extreme series just released one of their new mixes too.
It was DWI Extreme Glistening to Infinity.
Lame name, I know, but it was actually a really good mix of songs.
They had some Latin songs, they had a bunch of R&B and dance songs, and it's actually a really good mix.
But the thing is, for this specific release, they're actually making it
They're still dead.
Who cares?
Princess Diana is still dead.
Just in case you're wondering.
Princess Di.
How rude.
I would have loved to see, you know, the actual, you know how they always have those funny, witty, you know, subject lines, you know, they're always on the newspapers, you know, the wonderful headlines.
I wish, you know, there was a newspaper that put Princess Di, you know, D-I-V, because that'd be funny.
You know, you might be really offending somebody who's listening tonight.
But isn't that what we were good at doing?
Well, you know, if I'm offending Princess Di, then they shouldn't, you know... She's probably rolling in her grave.
Hook her up to an alternator.
Generate some power that way.
Let's change the subject, shall we?
Some folks still wanted to call in on our Skype line.
So I'm going to go ahead and open the Skype line back up.
It's available at www.OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
Click on Interact With Us, and you too can join in on the fun here on OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
So I'm going to give them just a couple minutes to get in.
Now's your chance on the Skype line.
In the meantime, I wanted to mention this because Rini linked me to this.
Hold on, our caller's having problems getting in.
Okay.
A couple minutes to get in.
That sounds like, you know, Ann Nicole Smith boarding a plane, you know.
It's like, come on, I'm ready for you.
Anyway, I'm supposed to mention this thing that Rini linked me to, and I think this came off of the DDR Freak forum somehow, and it's basically the, or it's actually linked to on
Konami of USA's website for Extreme 2.
There's actually an online user agreement and you can read all these details.
It's basically the blah blah blah blah blahs about the game.
Well, somewhere in here it mentions in the blah blah blah something about this online game does not have any automatic save feature and therefore will ask you to save your information to a memory card or hard disk drive.
So people are saying like, OMG, this game might have a hard disk drive support on it.
So...
I don't know.
I tend to think this is just some generic agreement that happens to have Konami's name inserted in there.
But we'll see.
Hey, turn down your speakers, buddy, and you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Yo, Sky, what's up?
Hey, who's this?
Hey, who's this?
It's Kuwabara.
Hello, Kuwabara.
I'm hearing myself.
Can you turn down your speakers or move the headphones or something?
Yeah, sorry, it's a built-in mic.
I'm actually fine.
Oh, that's all right.
Well, give us your thought, because I'm hearing myself, so give us your thought and then we'll respond to it.
Thought on what?
Why you're calling in tonight.
I just wanted to call in just to, you know, talk about stuff.
I really like 2DX and stuff.
Just because, you know, I want to change the subject from ITG and DDR.
It's starting to piss me off.
Okay, well, what is it you want to say that's not ITG DDR related?
DDR related.
I don't know, I really love Noria.
You love what?
Noria.
Noria?
That's 2DX related.
Extifer?
Echo.
Stop it!
I played a Noria song for you last break.
Yeah, I know, that was really nice of you.
Alright, no problem.
What's the thing you like most about 2DX?
I like 2DX because of the key sounds.
The Key Sounds
Oh wait, can you say that?
Oh, never mind, okay.
Well, it's our turn, dammit!
Alright, Miko, what's up?
Hurry up.
Miko, what's up?
Hurry up.
Who says they're... Oh, crap!
That's loud!
Sorry.
Okay, I'll talk really quietly.
Who said that they're delaying TempStyle because of Beatmania US?
Uh, I just thought it up because, uh, you know, it makes sense, doesn't it?
Well, don't listen to your brain.
That's something Konami would do, though, wouldn't it?
I mean, it just makes sense.
Why would they do that?
Well, they got a lot of people working there.
That's not a nice thing.
That's not a nice thing.
Nami's nice.
Besides, they're working on, they have, you know, the U.S.
offices to work on Beatmania U.S.
and then you have the Japanese offices to work on Beatmania 2DX.
I don't actually think that's how it's working, but I don't think they're delaying anything.
Don't listen to your brain, you know.
Oh, yeah, that's right.
Kuwabara, I'm going to go ahead and let you go because we're getting too much of that echo, but thank you for calling in and have a great day, okay?
Echo.
All right, later.
Alright, so Skypline's still open.
DarkSakura, who's probably ticked off on me, but that's alright.
That guy got in first, what can I say?
Now you know what it's like to be one of our listeners, trying to get in on the Skypline.
If we took a picture just then, we would have an echo image.
OMG, was that a hint?
OMG, was that a clue?
Was that a clue?
Go back to the freak board.
Alright.
So, just because TenStyle
is, um, or I'm sorry, just because, I'm sorry, just because Beatmania US is being worked on doesn't mean that TenStyle is not being worked on.
And it hasn't even been announced yet, so who knows if they're actually even doing it, but the release of a US game would not stop the production of a Japanese game.
From the man on the inside himself.
Anyway, let's go to our Skype line.
Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.
Hello?
Uh, can you hear me?
Yes, now we can.
What's up?
Oh my god, what a day.
This is the one and only DarkSakura, for those that may not recognize the voice.
This is DarkSakura, ladies and gentlemen.
You too, say hi.
Hello.
Hi.
Hi, Dan.
There's a little bit of lag, DarkSakura, so just tell us about your day.
I spent all day at Classic Gaming Expo looking at a bunch of stuff that I wanted to buy.
And I found myself actually put into a position of translator for some guy at this booth selling a bunch of Famicom and Super Famicom and Mega Drive games and PC Engine Hu cards.
And I actually didn't get to go to any of the panels because I was busy dueling at stuff and looking at the museum.
which actually wasn't as impressive as it was before.
It's just all the same stuff.
But they're going to be taking a year off next year and coming back in 2007 and hopefully that's going to be bigger and better.
This year was kind of eh, but I got to meet the guys who run Retro Gaming Radio.
Cool.
Pretty big.
We actually had a pretty long discussion about Don Bluth.
Oh, okay.
Um...
I also got to meet this person who built basically a miniature Nintendo that runs the Famicom and Nintendo games.
I took some pictures of that.
They'll be up on the site in a few days.
Is that the same one from E3?
I don't remember because I don't think I saw him at E3.
It was...
Famicom Loader Front Loader Disk System
Doki Doki Panic Doki Doki Panic
The whole reason behind that, and it makes a lot of sense, is... What's the name of that thing called, Anne?
California Extreme California Extreme, that's basically replacing all of the big massive arcade of retro games They had more games this year and almost all of them worked They had a Millipede, Mousetrap, Gorf, Tempest Dude, Mousetrap is awesome That's why I love my ColecoVision There's a Mousetrap and Gorf Gorf, who plays Gorf?
Dinky Dinky
It was a different hotel this year, right?
Yeah, it was at the Hyatt and Burlingame.
Was that where the Life 365 Awards were?
I don't remember.
No, it wasn't.
It was a different hotel.
We were actually in San Francisco.
Oh, that's right.
That's right.
Okay.
But there were people there who heard of us.
Wow.
That's crazy.
That's kind of cool.
But I made some contacts.
We will be having more on that in the future.
Cool.
But, you know, I did, though, for the people who were there, they were the folks that were really into it.
Oh, by the way, there was a new Lego sculpture.
Of what?
Pac-Man.
I took a picture.
Oh, that's cool.
And for the Moby Games thing, Dan got place number four and got me a t-shirt.
Oh, cool, cool.
For the whole show.
Oh, wow.
For what game?
We have to name the screenshot.
Oh, I remember that thing.
Okay, I remember that.
What was the contest they had last year where we all had to play the Stampede on Atari?
Did they do something like that again this year?
Twin Galaxies?
I think that there was some type of game going on on a widescreen.
One thing, Rob, I think that you'll get a kick out of in the museum room, they had a jaguar hooked up onto their projector, and it was Tempest X.
Awesome.
Which was Tempest 2000.
Awesome.
Tempest is like my favorite Jaguar game ever.
Was 8-Bit Weapon back this year?
Yes, 8-Bit Weapon was back.
Unfortunately, I was sort of out of cash because somebody found the core graphics in Strider on the PC Engine Duo.
Dope.
So I would have picked up one of their CDs, but I think I still got their card from last year.
I meant to contact them.
There's also another person there just playing a bunch of game music on a keyboard.
Just somebody who was part of the show.
There was also, for the people who were there, the Atari people were back, of course Moby Games, the Intellivision folks were there.
Still whoring out that Intellivision collection from like three years ago?
Yep.
There's also a couple guys there who were selling MVS carts.
For anyone who doesn't know, the MVS cartridges are the Neo Geo games and homemade JAMMA units to play them on.
And selling like, you know... Whoa.
Oh, whoa.
Whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoa, Jamie, hold up, hold up.
Jamie, your voice went like crazy there for a minute.
You sounded like an evil lord, a demon, from like an Atari 2600 game.
We gotta save that clip for the next intro.
That was crazy.
Start over again with that paragraph, Jamie.
Okay.
A guy there who was selling basically anything NEC, practically it was...
Duo R, Duo RX, Core Graphics, a bunch of Turbo Graphics, Turbo Duo Games, PC Engine Duo Games, Arcade Cards, you name it.
He had a bunch of good stuff.
We picked up like five HuCard games.
But his other main thing, though, is that he mods consoles.
He actually has basically regionless...
Duo Dittl Cell, because the one thing is that the Duo, the CD will read any region and has no problem with replicas.
However, the cards themselves are not universal and there's not any real good adapter, but he's modded a universal system for it.
And he does video mods, super guns, jamming units.
He actually has made this really tiny jamming unit for MVS cartridges.
I don't know if an explanation of those came through, but the MVS cartridges are the Neo Geo games.
I had wished that there were the modified cartridges to play on the AVS systems.
Also, again, the Intellivision people were there, like I said.
The people with the massive Atari stuff were there.
Expensive Lynx games, oh my god.
Um, but the booth that I liked the best, I'd have to say, was the, uh, the guy from Japan just selling stuff.
Oh, there's just a random guy from Japan selling stuff?
He was selling, uh, Famicom, Super Nintendo, um, cue cards, um, all kinds of stuff.
They were like five games for ten dollars.
That's cool.
So I picked up Final Fantasy II on the Famicom.
Cool.
Uh, Mappyland, in the box, on the Famicom.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Tuyo Pio for the Mega Drive and Legend of the Valkyrie for PC Engine.
That was $10 for all that?
$10.
You could make a killing for some of that on eBay.
It had a price tag of $20 on it.
Wow.
You could make a killing for some of that on eBay.
Yeah, but I actually want to play it.
Alright.
I don't know.
We'll see.
We'll see.
Who knows?
Maybe I'll get fed up and one of those will become a prize for one of our loyal
Ooh, that would be cool.
Alright, sounds good.
Right.
Stop teasing him.
Alright, well we're going to go ahead and we'll hear more about Classic Gaming Expo on this week's podcast.
You cannot hang up on me!
I'm not going to hang up on you, but we have to get to the FUs of the week and the other stuff too in a break, because I really got to go to the bathroom.
That was crap.
Hello?
Are you even listening to me?
Hello?
Is she there?
Whoa, hi.
Whoa, she went into evil warlord voice there again for a minute.
Anything else you want to say to the listeners before we go?
Words.
All right.
Lobster.
All right, have a good one, DarkSakura.
We'll see you back for the podcast.
Reject false icons.
Later.
Bye.
See, she beat me to the hang up button.
I like that.
Yeah, that was weird.
Like when she was.
I am the evil Lord Satan Like, that was really scary.
I got freaked out.
Alright.
Anyway, we're gonna go to a break because I have to pee.
And then when we come back from this break, we'll announce tonight's Cage Match winner and we'll get into the FUs of the week as well.
So, we're gonna do just Bimani Potpourri this break.
Even some wanna-be Bimani music in this break because I'm gonna get to that request that I screwed up last week in this break.
So, we'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio after this.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura DarkSakura DarkSakura
Thank you for watching
Thanks for watching!
I am a robot, sinking like a robot, walking on the spaceship every night and day.

Orange Lounge Radio.
Crap-free Bobani Radio.
We're back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
And in that break, you heard Naoki was still in my heart, Nina from In The Groove, Romeo and Juliet.
Juliet what?
Murmur Twins, a guitar mix from Pop Music and Love Is Dreaminess, 2DX, Sick Style.
Welcome back to Orange Laundry.
Oh, this is weird.
Now suddenly Loki and I are sitting in the room by ourselves.
Like, all of our guests abandon us, like, all at once.
I know.
I think Miklatov and Extifer went to Taco Bell, and... Because I don't eat Taco Bell, so I won't take Miklatov there.
And then, what, we have... John and Justin went in the front room to go watch television, because I guess that's more interesting than the show.
No, there's a certain...
There's a certain show that Jon has to watch every week, and I'm sure a lot of you out there are no different, although folks should consider investing in a VCR or TiVo or something.
I was reading here about Dancing Stage Max.
What's up with Dancing Stage Max?
I know there was a little news on Dancing Stage Max this week, so what's up with that?
There's a bit more now, because they've made it some games convention or whatever.
It was in Europe.
They've got some more stuff.
They have songs...
V, Hip2Hip, The Jam, Sugar Babes, Sophie Ellis, Bexter, Mixed Up World, Labelle, Lady Marmalade, Patty Labelle,
No, she never sang that song though, did she?
Says LaBelle.
I'm just telling you what it says.
Okay.
Who sang that song originally?
Adam Ant with Goody Two Shoes.
Oh, that's kind of interesting.
Franz Ferdinand with Michael.
Okay.
Natasha Bedingfield with These Words.
I love this song.
Hold on, I have a clip of this song.
I love this song.
And it will have the video from what I understand.
Alcazar with This Is The World We Live In Fatboy Slim with Wonderful Nights Naoto Suzuki featuring Martha the Polo Vision Dances and Chorus Yuzo Koshiro with Steps
You might remember them from, you know.
Oh, yeah.
Tragedy.
Yeah.
Tragedy.
No, I was thinking of steps with, um, was it, uh... Five, six, seven, eight.
I just know their song Tragedy because my, my... Now, I've, you know, I'm a gay guy myself, so I don't make fun of other gay guys very often, but I used to live with a flaming homosexual, okay?
Flaming Homosexual, love him to death.
He was a flaming homosexual and he used to listen to that song and do the little dance and everything.
Chain Reaction, Christina Milan with Dip It Low, Vic Reeves with Dizzy, Mile with Drop The Pressure, Daniel Bedingfield with Friday, and Carl Douglas with Kung Fu Fighting.
And then they've got some more here.
Looks like in the demo or the preliminary song list, they mentioned these words, Natasha Bedingfield, Michael, Franz Ferdinand, in the middle, Sugar Babes, Goody Two Shoes, Adam and the Ants, You Sexy Thing, Hot Chocolate, and Shout, Lulu.
Now, my question about You Sexy Thing, is it that song they always hear in the commercial, You Sexy, Sexy Thing, You Sexy, because that would be horrible.
I don't know, but there's going to be a Dance Master mode in it, as well as some advanced mode thing, and combo challenge mode, which is going to be interesting.
I think it's basically the same stuff as in DDR Extreme 2, pretty much.
So, that's what we've got there.
Sounds good.
Thank you for that update on what's going on over there.
Oh, and of course, Dancing Stage Mario Mix is coming soon.
DDR with Mario is a game we haven't really talked about a whole lot lately.
I know it came out in Japan to this big... The DDR fans, anyway, in America, really... People usually import their DDRs from Japan, but I haven't really heard of anybody importing Mario.
So nobody's really been going crazy over it.
How do you think that game's going to do over here?
I haven't really heard a lot of buzz about this game.
GameCube is sinking ship right now, especially after... Please, Nintendo fanboys, don't start flaming me because I love Nintendo dearly.
I love Nintendo.
But they fucked up that Zelda thing.
Come on, pushing back Zelda to 2006, come on.
They fucked that up.
so a lot of people are just like done with Nintendo for right now in fact if you're running if you look at the poll right now going on at OrangeLaunchRadio.com I don't think the Nintendo screwed up result is winning but a significant amount of people have been answering that that way so it's kind of I don't know interesting yeah I don't know really you know speaking on the rental side of things nobody carries the GameCube anymore nobody
and the stuff they release for it.
It's really kid-based games like Mario Superstar Baseball or Mario Strikers, which is coming out because everybody loves soccer or football, however you want to call it.
But just, I don't know.
of course I've got the mandatory fuck you Sky you hate Nintendo and I hate you comment from the chatroom I don't hate Nintendo I have not stopped playing Meteos for like the past two months I'm squeeing like a little girl over Nintendogs which is coming out Tuesday I don't even freaking like dogs that much I've never owned a dog in my life the only dog I ever liked was my grandma's Dachshund but I am buying Nintendogs because I'll be damned if that wasn't the cutest game I've seen in like five years
So don't tell me I hate Nintendo.
I love Nintendo.
They really fucked up Zelda.
They really, really fucked that up.
Really?
And this whole thing with the revolution, we still haven't heard shit about it.
And they're even talking about me releasing it the fall of 2006.
Wow, that's not gonna fucking suck.
Unless it's like super revolutionary, which I highly doubt that.
But we'll see.
All right.
Who wants to see the winner of tonight's cage match?
You want to know tonight's wiener for tonight's cage match?
Sure, since I'm the only other person in here.
There were a freaking ton of votes in tonight's cage match.
Ton of votes.
Not a single vote for DJ Sammy, which pisses me the fuck off.
So next week, you are getting another booty song.
You're getting something along the lines of Camel Toe.
or what was another booty song I put in?
Milkshake.
Milkshake, Put It In My Mouth.
All those songs I put in case before.
You're getting another one of those next week because I'm pissed off that not a single person voted for DJ Sammy.
Suck it.
So anyway, it came down to the other two songs.
It was actually very, very close.
A lot of votes, but a couple votes did sway it towards a two-week win for
Cold Storage with Onyx.
I should put my backup songs in more often.
Two weeks winning there, Cold Storage with Onyx.
Congratulations, Loki, you bastard.
I don't have to pick a song next week.
That's a reward enough for me.
So next week you get a booty song from me, because I'm pissed.
And I'm sure DarkSakura's not happy either, so she'll dig into her archives of
Nerd Music and find something.
How else do you explain MC Chris?
That's his Nerd Music.
Nobody else gets MC Chris but nerds.
So I'm calling her Music Nerd Music, but with love and respect, of course.
All right.
Anyway, we're going to get into the FUs of the week.
It's that time of the show where we get a little bit angsty and we do the FUs of the week.
So...
Grr, Arrg
Alright, as a reminder, boys and girls, if you have an FU of the week you want to send in, you can submit us an FU by joining our chat room, www.orangeloungeradio.com and clicking on chat, and you can send me a private message, and we will read your FUs, but...
May I take this opportunity, since Jamie isn't here to fill this space right now, to give you guys some reminders.
We do not give FUs of a personal nature.
Unless it's like mom, dad, because we've all been angsty teens.
We do those.
And if it's somebody we don't know, but if you're flaming somebody in the community specifically, we usually don't like that unless it's like Jack Thompson or something.
Or me.
We all hate him.
Or Loki.
We let you flame Loki.
But we don't like to flame people that aren't here to defend themselves.
So those are always off limits.
And, uh, no racist FUs, unless they're really funny.
Because that's the only time we'll let them in, is if they're really funny.
Alright, uh, let's see, actually I have a private message from DarkSakura, so maybe she does have some FUs.
Here we go, she would like to say, Fuck my hip hurting!
And fuck the speed limit, which I broke by at least 20 miles.
And fuck not buying a Duo RX.
So those are DarkSakura's FUs of the week.
I think she's still typing.
Oh, no, she's... Oh, here's another one.
And lastly... I'm waiting for this.
DarkSakura's last FU.
FU to the internet being slow, and FU to the big buffer.
The 30 seconds between when we talk and when you guys actually hear it.
We're waiting.
Oh, she's typing a big long sentence here, because it's taking a while to get it.
We'll just enjoy the Silent Hill 2 music here for a little bit.
1, 2, 2...
Oh, here it is.
Fuck being jacked up on Vicodin and unable to drive.
And DarkSakura?
Yes, the Coleco emulator was on the DS.
Now it's time for Loki's FUs.
Just sobs.
So I'm sitting there going, because the fucking, then he flips me off, so then he finally turns, you know, pulls over, and then I flip him off and honk my horn and make, you know, comments like, You know, stuff like that.
Our listeners, speakers, thank you for that.
Well, they had to, you have to understand that I was yelling very loud, so, you know, I was trying to convey that, because I said,
I yelled, you know, you fucking piece of shit.
It isn't quite, you know, the same effect.
Anyways.
And then fuck you to the fact that I've still got to drive my fiance around everywhere because that kind of sucks.
And I still need a picture of me doing this show for a stupid magazine thing.
I found all my batteries.
I can take a picture.
Okay, cool.
Yes, all right.
That's all I have.
We'll pose pictures later.
And just fuck you to Jack Thompson because it's fun to say that.
All right.
My turn.
I would like to give a big F you to getting sick and an F you to Southwest Airlines for their little hotbeds of viruses they call airplanes and the fact that I caught a sinus infection an F you to the fact that I didn't go to the doctor for a few days an F you to my allergy to amoxicillin because apparently amoxicillin is the best thing to take for this stuff but if I take amoxicillin I break out in a big rash and I look like Freaky Rash Boy so I can't stop laughing
Why are you laughing at that?
Will you show up at the next DDR tournament as Freaky Rashboy?
No, because they say if I do that too much, I might die, so I can't take penicillin, like, ever.
Okay, a really good tournament, then.
Anyway, so, an FU to the fact, an FU to the nasal spray I have being a brand copay, because brands are more expensive than generics.
And that's it, that's all my FUs of the week, I'm really not that angsty, because I've been sick all week, I haven't had time to get angry.
So we're gonna go to Justin!
Hello.
Uh, hmm, what can I say?
Oh yeah, my FUs are kind of tied into Jamie's, oddly.
FU to my hip hurting, because I have a hip problem, and it really has been hurting for like a month now, and I don't know what to do.
And also tied into Jamie, FU to female drivers.
Because they keep trying to hit me when I'm on the freeway, and that's kind of annoying.
Now, uh, I can understand if you need to get somewhere fast, but don't go in the slow lane.
Keep in the fast lane and stay there, please.
Had one driving today, doing her hair and makeup while driving.
Oh my god.
Fucking suck.
My friend keeps on, uh, as soon as she's trying to go to school in the morning, she always takes like a left turn, and every single day the same woman cuts her off so she can do her makeup.
It's ridiculous.
And that's about it.
Oh wow, Mikulatov gets back just in time from Taco Bell to give his FUs of the week.
Okay, I want music.
This is your music.
What is it?
It's Help Me Dr. Dick by Erotic.
I used to have an actual music that you would play.
Really?
What do you want?
Oh, put the new one from Happy Sky, the one that's in French.
Jesus Christ, what's the name of it?
Or you'll get an FU.
It's like... I don't know how to say it.
How about you just do your FUs and stop whining like a little bitch?
Because that's my FU.
Okay, anyway, I don't really care.
Oh, this is Twin Amadeus.
Sorry.
You get this.
Deal with it.
You get the Christmas sounding song.
Wouldn't it be funny if I don't have any FUs?
FU to Medios for being way too addictive.
FU to Pump It Up for PS2 because unlocking songs is way too hard to do on that game.
FU to Work
Tag.
Tag.
but probably Christine.
An FU to Miklatov for not offering to pick me up a pizza.
Because that's the only thing I like at Taco Bell is Pizza Hut.
You should have said something.
I'm just kidding, it's alright.
Alright.
Let's go to the next FUs, which would be the ones from our chatroom.
Yay.
Dark Knight would like to say an FU to gas prices.
Quote the Dark Knight nevermore.
Oh, but FU to work and being broke as hell.
Misty would like to say a private message to me.
That wasn't an FU.
Sorry, guys.
Oh, wait, no, there it is.
I'm sorry.
I didn't recognize it because it didn't start with FU2.
It says, You people should be lucky that I'm not so angsty because I went to Six Flags today.
FU to the max, too, at Six Flags, having dusty-ass pads.
Thank leetness I managed to own a minute with 29 greats and one miss, in sandals even.
Brini says, an F you to learning to drive.
Enough said.
An F you to all the IRC chat users who want us to stop advertising that one channel.
Which channel?
If I say it, then I'm dignifying it with acknowledging it.
Which channel?
Take every inside joke from the past five episodes of Order's Lounge Radio and combine it into one name, and that's the name of the channel.
Wow.
So, Oregon Trail, Bleached...
Asshole, what else?
All of it.
Chimera, and by the way, the whole chatroom is saying F you to this song, but you can just deal.
Chimera says F you to school starting in about three days.
Oh, and Jack Thompson, because MPQ said so.
And Spider Stomp.
Socorina says F you to myself for whoring old jokes in the chatroom.
And F you to Jack Thompson, because MPQ said so.
And F you to someone for making Socorina is pissed.
Oops, I advertised that channel, sorry.
Yay, somebody in the chatroom said, I heart this song.
I heart it too, thank you.
Alright, Lesson Izaku says, F you to this being my last week at home before having to move back to campus next Sunday.
F you to being broke and being jobless for almost nine months.
F you to not having enough time to hang out with other fellow DDR players every time I go to Chinatown Fair, a DDR and In The Groove 2 arcade in Chinatown, New York City.
And F you to having to wear a retainer after my braces were removed last week.
They hurt like hell and I can't speak in them clearly.
in them.
Kuwabara says, F you to Noria for making such a sexy video to Sylvia Drive.
I can't pass the fucking song.
Goggle says, not Google, but Goggle says, I would like to say F you to US News College Rankings.
They really don't mean anything, but all the overachieving, pushy parents flock to the top ones and crowd up the tours so I can't hear anything.
Tomokun would like to say, fuck starting school soon.
Fuck people I don't know taking pictures of me playing para para dancing.
And fuck a certain thread in the Midwest forum.
Fuck, fuck!
Dark Knight wants to give one more FU.
Oh, and a major FU to some local buttwads that go nuts when they have a laptop sale on an old-ass school uses iBooks.
Because of this, many people got hurt by the idiots.
I heard about the iBook stampede.
It was crazy.
I heard about it too.
And I giggled.
You would.
By the way, I haven't heard anyone use the term buttwads in like years.
That's great.
Thank you.
Ask Orange Lounge when we come back from this quick break.
Featuring more erotic.
No, just kidding, because I'll get beat up if we actually do that.
I already played erotic.
Erotic fans, I already played it this show.
How about some guitar freaks?
I like Guitar Freaks.
Guitar Freaks is cool.
So we're going to do some of that, and when we come back, we will do some Ask Orange Lounge.
We're just going to do a couple songs here.
We'll start off with a little bit of Jet Coaster Girl, and we'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio.
Ask Orange Lounge, sending your questions right now.
Ask Orange Lounge
There's only a little bit left, but it's different today.
Of course, yesterday was a B-Holiday Sunday.
The beat of the beat can't be cut off.
I want to make my heart beat faster.
If this feeling is true,
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
Music, Music, Music
Don't you know, baby, you could show up right on time Can't you see, can't you see, I've been waiting for you Can't you see, baby, you could fly on
All right, you know what time it is, kids.
Time for the next segment.
Let's bring it on.
Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.
What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?
One thing I will tell you is...
Even though nobody asked, is that now Miklatov made this room smell like Taco Bell?
Thanks a lot for that, because, you know, Taco Bell makes me sick.
You're welcome.
Alright.
Participating in tonight's Ask Orange Lounge, myself, Loki, and Miklatov.
Everybody else left the room for better things, I guess.
HighSchoolFreshman
Just make sure you don't fuck up and go to the wrong classes.
I was always worried about going to the wrong classes.
Get your schedule ahead of time.
In my situation where I had it was, my junior high split up into two different high schools.
Some of my friends weren't there and some of them were new.
Find your friends.
It's not going to be that much different than junior high, really.
Who gives a shit about the upperclassmen?
If they're still picking on you, that's retarded.
Yeah, the upperclassmen hazing thing is so, like, 1970, because every school now has the anti-hazing rules.
So it's nothing, even when I went to high school, which was quite some time ago, they didn't have a problem with that.
So, you know what?
Just be yourself.
Just don't...
Don't try to be something you're not.
I wish I could tell every high schooler in the world that.
Just be yourself and who cares what other people think.
Exactly.
Who cares?
And really, when you think about it now, when you get out of high school and stuff, you look back on it and you're just like, who cares?
You know, like, if people didn't like you for some reason, you don't care.
All you look back on is the things that you didn't do that you wish you had.
That's basically it.
Okay, to completely counter, you know,
Subtitles by the Amara.org community
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I don't know.
The only people you can make fun of are the stupid people.
Not the retarded people, because they can't help it, but stupid people.
Every click serves its purpose.
We've got to move on.
We've got a ton of questions tonight.
I begged twice and I got tons of questions the second time.
Rini wants to know, my question is someone to please describe quest mode in Ultramix 3 if they've played it at E3.
Shane probably can't really say anything about quest mode.
Super deformed characters.
Yeah, the characters are like the giant heads.
Basically, you move across the capitals of the United States, starting in Sacramento.
Thank you very much.
I think it costs points to move around the map, and you earn points by playing the song in the city.
Was it like a challenge that you had to do or something?
Hey, guess what?
Quest mode kind of changed since E3.
Did it?
Yeah.
Can you tell us anything new about it?
No, you can continue though, because it follows the same basic principle you're talking about.
Bastard.
So you earn, I guess, points by playing the song in the city and then you can move around the map, and I suppose that... You pick up more players as you go.
I think so, yeah, you pick up more players.
I'm assuming that this is going to be how a shitload of things unlock in Ultimix 3, or however many.
I think the goal is to ultimately conquer all 50 states.
Or maybe it's just 48 continental, I don't know.
That's where you're wrong!
Oh, really?
It's around the world.
That's where you're wrong!
Canada?
Oh god, do you have to go to Mexico?
I hope not.
I don't play DDR in Mexico, it's pumping up there.
Yeah, it actually is.
Alright.
Alright, um, let's see.
So you can't tell us anything about what might have changed, not anything?
I really can't.
It's just, it's not that big a difference, but there are some subtle changes to it that... Alright, we'll see.
Alright, Rini also wants to know... Oh, you will see.
Rini wants to know, oh, and when are you guys going to do some online Ultramix 2 tournament?
Um, that's a good idea.
Sometime before Ultramix 3.
Um, in the next couple months when we stop being lazy.
We're trying to plan a real DDR tournament, um, and I'm trying to go to the tournament back east as well.
Um, it shouldn't be that hard.
We'll maybe start a forum, or a thread in the forums and see if there's enough interest in it, because last time we tried to do it, like, nobody wanted to play.
We will see.
We'll post a thread in the forums and see what we get out of that.
Socorino wants to know, what is the official release date for Xtreme 2?
I'll field that one.
It's September, I want to say, 27th.
That might be the 26th.
I know it's the last week of September.
Okay.
Sakurina also wants to know, does Konami of America plan on releasing Dancing Stage featuring System of a Down anytime soon?
I will go ahead and answer that question.
No.
Can I answer it too?
No.
Sakurina, oh, that's the official word from a Konami person, by the way.
Sakurina also wants to know, where do babies come from?
Vaginas, actually.
Dark Knight.
Oh, never mind.
That was a personal thing he's sharing with me.
Xander C wants to know, I can't read it anyway if it's personal.
Xander C wants to know, why did Konami kill off Parapara anyways?
It's like they knew I'd like the game later and killed it off just to get me even more pissed than when they started attacking in the groove.
It's the same reason why Billy Ray Cyrus doesn't make any more music.
It's because it's not popular anymore.
Even though there's a lot of sarcasm there, there is some truth.
From what I understand, Parapara kind of went downhill in Japan for a little while.
Yeah, it was a fad.
That's all it was.
But it seems like it's still going on.
I mean, you still see Eurobeats big with initial D and stuff.
I have a hard time believing it's dead altogether.
I guess here it is.
Why did Keyboard Mania stop?
Why did Dance Maniacs stop?
Why did any of those great Bomani series that we don't come to love until long after they stopped, stop?
Because they didn't make enough money.
They didn't sell enough machines.
The end.
That's the reason.
Infer what you want about the culture and the pop thing.
If it didn't make money, that's why it didn't continue.
But then again, DDR was making money, but whatever.
Whatever.
We could argue about that till we're blue in the face.
Legend of Zaku says, Hmm, I wonder what surprises wait for us on the song list for Ultramix 3.
Well, if we told you, Zaku, they wouldn't be a surprise.
Also, is it just me or is My My My from EX2 a damn good song to freestyle to?
I'm white, therefore I can't freestyle.
It's just a good song.
It's one of my favorites, that's for sure.
The background cracks me up, too.
Initial D... Okay, Jamie's...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Legend of Zaku said, this one's for Miklatov.
Will Quest Mode make stops at New York City or the East Coast?
He can't really answer questions about Quest Mode because he's under NDA.
I will answer, though.
From what I saw at E3, it looks like you were stopping in the capital of every state.
So you wouldn't stop in New York City, but Albany.
So...
DarkSakura says...
Why the fuck does southern style iced tea taste so heavenly?
I don't know.
You know what?
I was going to have iced tea at Cracker Barrel, which is as close to Southern Stylist as I'll get, but I didn't get the chance to do that while I was visiting the East Coast.
I have a question for her.
Why aren't you here supporting Pump It Up?
She can't because of her... She was at Classic Gaming Expo and she hurt her hip.
And she was partially turned into an evil warlord.
That was really cool.
She was already an evil warlord.
That is going in the next intro.
That's for sure.
Smackman would like to know
Why do only the crappy songs get stuck in your head?
Because you listen to bad music.
That's a very good question.
It's just Murphy's Law that bad songs are going to get stuck in your head.
And I don't know, you know, it's just a fact of life.
So I leave you with this.
This is a good song.
Enjoy, courtesy of Orange Lounge Radio.
Uh, Spiritsnare, question, do you get to kill Naoki as an extra stage in quest mode?
Um, I will answer that question, no you do not, and I don't work for Konami and I haven't seen the game outside of E3, but I just know the answer is no, I'm sorry to say.
Um, but it changed since E3.
Dun dun dun!
Let's see, uh, Addendum, do you get to kill Jack Thompson as a one more extra stage in quest mode?
I will also answer that question.
No, you do not.
I'm sorry to say.
And Konami, could you confirm that?
Our Konami rep?
Konami.
I'm all of Konami.
Yeah, basically.
When it comes to this question, yes, you are.
I hate him as much as you guys do, but he provides entertainment for the morning every day for me because he always does something new and stupid, so I don't want him dead.
I don't want him to shut up.
So please quit trying to kill him.
Besides, there's plenty more games for him to be angry over, you know, come fall.
Yeah, so, I mean, we've just hit the tip of the iceberg.
It's gonna get a lot better, I'm sure.
I don't know, when Titanic hit the tip of the iceberg, it didn't get much better.
It's almost like the living room had heard that joke.
God, sometimes I wish we were a TV show, seriously.
Anyway,
We've got to start wrapping up the show.
However, there's one more question, so I'm going to be nice and take this question because we started a little late anyway.
Rene wants to know, Why doesn't Konami bring back hold notes and scratches in Beatmania 2DX?
Rene would like to point out, scratches were in Beatmania the final and hold notes in Beatmania 3, I believe.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
As far as Konami in Japan, I couldn't tell you, but look at this.
Beatmania 5 key songs are making its way into the US, and you can already see that Konami US is doing its own thing with Beatmania.
Like, they have the balls to change the interface, for one, to a new color.
Granted, it's just a new color, but it's something.
It's also Happy Sky Difficulty Names.
Yes, and rumor is that the controllers are going to be different.
No, it's not a rumor.
Enos confirmed it in an interview on, I think, GameSpot.
They have the rounded edges and they address the buttons.
Oh, super.
I thought that was something that... Yeah, anyway.
And also, I'm hoping that they bring actual hold keys, for example, like in Keyboard Mania or in Easy to DJ.
That would be awesome if they implemented that later on.
So I would say probably not this mix.
But, you know, they're going to want to have things later on that kind of make their mixes like, ooh, it's the new thing in this mix.
Don't count it out for the U.S.
mixes.
I seriously, I would say don't count it out for the U.S.
later mixes.
So long as you guys support it and buy it, because, I mean, if it tanks, well, it's on you.
I'm at least buying a controller to replace my old one, because I'm excited about the idea of the new controller, so we'll see.
And then Blame TV.
Yep.
Alright, that's going to do it for tonight's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
Thank you guys so much for tuning in and listening to and supporting us.
We appreciate it.
Don't forget, we also have a live show on Tuesday night.
That's Pump Up the Volume with the one and only DarkSakura.
And I will be bringing a show back very soon.
I know I've said that for like the past seven weeks, but I got very sick this week, so that's why I didn't do it.
But maybe this next week.
And, you know, more exciting stuff coming to Orange Lounge Radio.
Also the podcast.
We have an unbelievable amount of listeners on the podcast.
Thank you guys so much for your support of the podcast.
It's crazy.
We're also working on something for those PSP owners out there.
Oh, that's going to be great.
So we're hoping to have a breakthrough on that, being the first online station to have something like that.
So we'll see.
Anyway, thank you guys for your support.
We appreciate you.
Love you.
Thank you for watching!
I ate too much Taco Bell, now my stomach hurts.
And two, does anybody want to go to work for me tomorrow?
Because I don't.
Loki, your final thought.
I've got to bring over next week the iToy, because I have, and the microphone, because I have SingStar Pop, that one we've got to try out.
Yeah, I want to see that.
And then I also have iToy, Harry Potter iToys,
Sega, and iToyPlay, and I think I'm going to try to get Play 2 as well.
Even though DarkSakura, I think, called it a bastardization of the original Samba de Amigo, I really want to play the iToySamba, because I didn't get to play it at E3.
So I don't want to misquote her.
She might not have said that, but I'm pretty sure she didn't.
It should be fun.
But, um, there's that.
And then, um, I've got an actual, um, another import I gotta try.
It's another street racing game store, like, initially.
They need to put, um, what is it, um, Midnight Toon on their Wangdangs, Midnight Maximum Toon on the console systems, because that'd be awesome.
That game's actually pretty cool.
Alright.
Alrighty, um...
and I would just like to say thank you guys very much for listening and I hope I feel better next week and I'm just looking forward to getting in some major gaming this next week with my brand new PlayStation.
And on behalf of DarkSakura I'd like to say reject false icons because you know that's her thing and what she'd say if she were here.
And that's it.
The final word of the show.
One word to sum it all up.
The one and only Miklatov.

Happy, happy, joy, joy, happy, happy, joy, joy I don't think you're happy enough.
That's right.
I'll teach you to be happy.
I'll teach your grandmother to suck eggs.

Happy, happy, joy, joy.
Happy, happy, joy, joy.
Happy, happy, joy, joy.
Happy, happy, joy, joy.

Happy, happy, joy, joy.
If you ain't the granddaddy of all liars.
The little critters of nature.
They don't know that they're ugly.
That's very funny.
A fly marrying a bumblebee.
I told you I'd shoot.
But you didn't believe me.
Why didn't you believe me?
