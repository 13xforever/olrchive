The following live program is a special presentation of Orange Lounge Radio.
On tonight's program, ladies and gentlemen, Orange Lounge Radio is back for episode number 153.
After taking last week kind of a mini-vacation.
I mean, there was still a show, but it wasn't the show-show, right?
I was there.
You were there, but it wasn't the OLR experience, so to say.
It was the DarkSakura... We were recording the podcast while we were broadcasting.
So it was the Let's Multitask show.
No.
Anyway, tonight, though, I'm back after being gone for two weeks, because I know there was a show a couple weeks ago.
Did you enjoy your box?
I enjoyed the FedEx box immensely.
I was popping on the Bubba app.
So on tonight's show, we're going to talk about my East Coast tournament I went to.
I went to an East Coast tournament, and I saw it in the group, too.
So I can't wait to talk about that.
And also, we're going to talk about the DDR with fire.
DarkSakura's favorite thing, DDR with fire.
Orange Lounge Radio is presented in the TMI sound format.

My name is Rob Roberts.
You might know me as Sky.
Joining me, as always, are my awesome co-hosts in this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm, Ms.
Jamie Summers, Dark Sakura, and the DDR Freak Moderator of the Month, might I add.
Yep, that's true.
I'm not sure.
Turn that on.
Make sure it's on.
It is on.
It's on, but very quiet.
I don't know what's going on over there.
Weird.
Here.
Shit.
Okay.
Canter that one.
See if that works.
Sorry.
Sound problems.
Are you there now?
I'm here.
Hi, guys.
There you are.
That's weird.
Okay, we'll fix that during the break.
Also, here is Loki.
I am here.
Barely.
You ran in during the intro there.
We were worried.
I was looking for a song for Cage Match, and...
Oh shit, I gotta get a song for Cage Match, don't I?
That's what I've been doing for the last two hours.
I did?
You just never left instructions on how to upload the damn thing.
I won?
How'd that happen?
Alright, I picked a song at the last minute.
Alright, well, whatever.
Cool.
Good, I don't have to pick a song tonight.
Alright.
Good.
A little stressed there.
That's fine.
That's alright, we'll figure out a contingency plan.
We'll put it in double or something.
Alright, so anywho, we're gonna go to a quick break featuring some music from the DDR while we figure out what happened to Jamie's microphone.
And also, we'll just, you know, get comfortable and get ready to do some chatting.
We're going to talk about fire tonight, Loki.
I know.
You know that's coming up.
I'm going to talk about In The Groove, too, as well.
I have In The Groove, actually.
Oh, I heard that this came up while I was gone, so you've got to fill me in on this.
We'll be back after this quick break featuring some music from Dead DDR.
Actually, this first song is also an In The Groove song, kind of, sort of.
Kind of, sort of.
We'll be back after this.
Thanks for watching!
I just did my own love for you I need to know, I need to know, I need to know how you feel I gotta know, I gotta know, I gotta know if it's real I need to know, I need to know, I need to know how you feel I gotta know, I gotta know, I gotta know if it's real
I'm giving all my heart to you, my love I justify my love for you
I'm giving you my heart, my soul, my love I used to cry my love for you
It's a long way to go, honey.
I know, but I'm afraid.
Where are we going?
Into the Dark Black Forest.
into the dark, black forest.
I'm back.
I'm back from my trip that I went to the East Coast.
I was sent in FedEx packaging, courtesy of Loki and DarkSakura.
I'm glad that they treated you well.
You know, they actually lost some of our shipments the other week, so I was like, hey, he might be gone.
We might never get him back.
Actually, FedEx was full, so I had to suffer a fate worse than FedEx.
I had to fly Southwest.
Thanks for watching!
Oh lord, try spending five hours on a plane with Grandpa, who's really, really obese.
I mean, you know, not that there's anything wrong with being really obese, but when you're trying to sit next to me on a plane, it's like, you know, I've got no wiggle room whatsoever.
So what were your in-flight movies?
It's Southwest, there is no in-flight movies.
There is when you bring a laptop.
Yeah, I brought my PSP.
I'm going to talk about that on the podcast, because I did bring my PSP, and...
Sharks Girl, if you're out there, I love you, because she loaned me movies I could watch on my PSP.
And I've always knocked the idea of movies on a PSP, but I take it all back after this trip.
I take it all back.
I am so sorry.
I'm so, so sorry for those comments, because seriously, it saved my ass this week, so I'm very happy.
So my in-flight movies were Tron on the way over, which, believe it or not, I'd never seen before, and iRobot on the way back, on PISP, the PSP.
So, um, but it didn't stop this grandpa guy from trying to talk to me in his little, not just grandpa, but, um, the daughter, or the grand- the daughter, the granddaughter was in sixth grade, that was kind of one of those, like, scary-looking children.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
The tiny ass screen.
If you thought watching a movie on your PSP was bad, these things have the tiniest screen in the world and the quality just stinks.
I don't know.
Anyway, so she was showing off her computer to me and kept asking questions about the PSP and I'm just like, leave me alone.
Pretend you didn't speak English.
That's what I need to do next time.
Just bludgeoned her to death with the PSP.
That's why I need to go see that movie Red Eye because maybe I'll get some ideas from that movie for the next time I go.
So we'll see.
I don't know if we should support any more of Wes Craven's stuff.
I mean, come on.
Do we need to really inspire him to make more Nightmare on Elm Street movies?
Yes, we do.
Yes, we do.
And we also need to inspire him to make a Scream 4 because I didn't think that those movies were going to be missed at all.
But now that they're gone and there's really not been a lot of good horror movies, I kind of miss them.
Exactly.
And what will Scary Movie parody on if they don't make any more Scream movies?
DarkSakura
I really have been trying to get stuff together because I'm starting school next week, so I didn't really get to play too much except for a little PSO and trying to get Ragnarok to install, but for some reason the Korean Ragnarok won't install on my computer.
Is it because it's Korean?
Possibly, honestly.
I think that they've upgraded on the newest build, so I need a really old build of it.
I seem to recall that the Korean, because I think you tried to get, no, who tried to get me to install this once?
Somebody was getting me to install the Korean one so that I could patch it to play on a free server.
It must have been LankyStyle, because he's all into that.
If you think Loki is a pirate, hang out with LankyStyle sometime.
Let's see the new Ragnarok Online.
It's so advanced.
It bans you before you even decide to play.
Stop it.
Anyway, I don't want to cut off DarkSakura, but I tried to install it once.
It was a pain in the ass.
I had to do all these special things.
It just can't initialize, so I need to figure out how to get past that.
Anyway, it's just really been... I can't find my Illustrator book, which means I might have to buy another one if I can't find it by Monday.
Like Adobe Illustrator?
Yeah, because one of my classes is Illustrator, the other one is Geography, and then halfway through the next semester I'm taking Dreamweaver and my other technical writing class with a teacher who says I have flawless writing.
Which means DarkSakura is going to be doing our site and all the graphics as soon as she graduates school.
Maybe before then.
Or the Orange Lounge site might start becoming homework for me.
Also, sort of a half plug for Pump Up the Volume.
In a couple weeks I'm going to be doing a demo for Dark Records.
They just went live this week and friends of mine are behind that.
And since I always try to play new music for everybody.
We can say the familiar DDR face that's behind a lot of this, right?
Well, my iguana girl is working with them, but they're people that, you know, I used to work with one of them.
I haven't, I think a lot of this has developed while I was kind of on vacation and tuned out of the world.
So what's going on?
They're making their own label type thing?
They're putting out the first record as a compilation of just different artists in the community.
So I'm going to be playing all that since I play new music on my show when I can.
Right.
And isn't it like synth pop, some of it?
Some synth pop, goth industrial.
Cool.
Pretty variant stuff across the angst-ridden level.
So possible Ultramix 4 music someday.
Maybe.
You never know.
You never know.
Well, that's kind of cool.
And all the rest of it.
We bought furniture today.
Dan bribed me with a bass guitar, which I'm not getting.
I'm actually going to pay a trainer instead.
How exactly do you get bribed with a bass guitar?
Because I like the furniture first because it's red suede.
But we ended up buying it anyway.
We got a big chaise lounge and a couch.
And we're going to get back and get end tables for it and everything.
It's comfy.
And suede.
Cool.
And the cat is not allowed anywhere near it.
And Shermie stopped peeking.
That's good.
What happened with your kitty?
Cat flew.
We think she had West Nile.
Someone I know had it.
Really?
Yes.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Oh, I thought it was just Sacramento had the problem.
Oh, no, no.
One of my good friends lives in the D.C.
area.
She knew people who had it.
They're spraying out there, too, and the spray makes her sick.
I thought the spray was only happening out here.
No, this is all over the country.
Oh, dang.
Shows how much I know.
And typically in more humid areas, but still.
That would not be Sacramento.
Well, I know, but we also do have a floodplain.
And standing water does pool.
But...
Anyway, what I was trying to say about that is, I don't know if this is possible, maybe Shermie might have had some type of variant or something, because she would eat and then throw up and then cry pathetically.
You want to hear something really gross about what I got from a bug once?
What?
Okay, I once fell asleep on my couch, like out in the living room or something.
This was when I was living in Chico.
And I think I fell asleep with my mouth open.
You know how some people have their mouths open a little bit?
Well, I think a bug got in there and bit me on my gums.
because the next day my gum swelled up hella big and they were bleeding and stuff.
Imagine if you didn't brush your teeth for a year.
You're almost describing scurvy.
Maybe I caught scurvy.
And seed deficiency.
Wow.
And your teeth start falling out and your gums start to bleed.
No, my teeth didn't fall out and everything went away like three days later.
But it was really disgusting during the process.
And that was the only thing I could think of is that I must have been bitten by a bug because one part of it was slightly swollen, so I think it was a bug bite.
It was very similar to a mosquito bite.
That's icky poo.
Anyway, just thought I'd share.
Fun!
Enjoy that lovely image.
America.
Otherwise, it's just been busy.
Busy, busy, busy.
Sorry.
No, it's alright.
I've been sleepy all day.
I had coffee.
I didn't do anything.
I slept for 12 hours last night.
Mr. Jetlag.
Well, not just that, but the fact that
DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
I don't know, I could say my week has been okay.
Nelly's week has been kind of on the rocks.
First, she started off her week by having her car stolen.
That sucks.
And, yeah, so I've had to drive her around places and stuff.
And then she found a wedding dress yesterday, so that was kind of cool.
And otherwise, what I've been doing this week has been utilizing the internet for my advantage.
That's the best way to put it.
and because of that I have gotten to play so many damn games it's not even funny and um oh yesterday I went and bought a DVD burner because I had to upgrade my uh um pirating ability um to be able to burn DVDs that and just I need it for wedding stuff as well and then um so I had to install my CD burner into my mom's computer which I'm sure she'll be grateful for but she won't know how to use and um
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
It's unlimited bandwidth, but it's like $14.95 a month.
And then the other server thing I'm on, which is basically a list, is $0.50 a month, I think.
And so I just basically signed up for that.
I'm going to try it out for a month.
If it's something I'm interested in, then yeah, I'll go for it.
Probably not, though, because
They don't have everything I'm looking for on there.
It's nice because I can download files really fast.
I love it, by the way, that you refuse to pay for anything, but you'll pay for the program to let you play.
All this software.
But if you think about it, though, because I've been trying to get... Speaking of which, I'm getting back into the music stuff.
I bought two sample CDs.
I bought one sample CD from BT, which is $100.
I bought another one, or I'm bidding on one that started off at $39.99.
I don't get you, because when you do spend money, you spend like $100 on a fucking CD.
Two CDs.
My bad.
My bad.
Two CDs.
Well, it's because I can't get it anywhere else.
It's no longer being made.
It's not on anywhere.
Trust me, I've looked at all the free angles for this first before I go and actually buy something like this.
They're just not selling it anymore.
So, I wanted to get it because BT is the fucking man when it comes to, you know, awesome breakbeats and that type of stuff.
And so, I have, like, one CD is basically all drum loops and stuff and the other one is all kind of like, you know, ambient sound kind of crap.
So I got those.
Well, I got the one at least.
I don't know about the other one.
I still have to wait on that.
And then just pretty much waiting for that stuff to come in and audio software stuff, which is worth over $2,000.
Anyways, but I'm merely trying it out.
I will delete it after 24 hours.
Yeah, sure you will.
Yeah, okay.
No, but honestly, what a load of crap is that, too?
Who said that that is a law, that you can download the program as long as you delete it within 24 hours?
Somebody made that shit up.
You know it.
I'm just trying to stuff out.
I've been having a lot of fun with my HD loader.
That's all I have to say.
I still think that you should tell all those people who say that using acid sucks to go bite your ass or something.
Well, that's why I'm going to create some good music with acid.
But I need the good samples because I'm lazy.
There was my point, though.
DJ Danger Mouse uses acid.
Absolutely.
For those that are kind of newer listeners to the show that don't know about the acid debate, Bomani Style once had a remix contest a while ago.
They have a remix contest going on now.
Well, they don't have anything going on now because their site's been down a couple days.
It was up this morning.
Maybe it's up again.
I don't know.
But anyway, they had a remix contest a while back and they said no mashups and nothing done in Acid type thing, right?
And so come to find out, like a bunch of popular DJs use Acid.
We got MidiHead on the show, asked him how he did his remixes for Ultramix 2 and he said Acid.
Now to be fair, he all seizes free loops.
He does, but... But who cares?
They're both the same damn program.
I mean, honestly, they're very similar.
So, who cares?
But yeah, so that's basically my week.
It's been a lot of downloading and a lot of Nelly yelling at me, Get out of your computer!
You know, that type of thing.
Question from chat, are you still relenting over Graffiti Kingdom?
I bought Graffiti Kingdom yesterday, but I haven't gotten a chance to play it yet.
Gotcha.
Just curious.
It was ironic because my PAL version of it finished downloading right when I bought it, so I was like, okay, fine, I'm just going to stick with this one.
Okay, that works.
Okay, well, me, my week and my day, gee.
Yesterday was a very interesting day because I left Philadelphia in the morning.
I stopped in Phoenix for a three-hour layover.
I ended up doing lunch with our webmaster, VxJasonXV, because I happen to be in Phoenix.
So that's just kind of neat.
I did lunch in Phoenix and then came home.
So it was an interesting day yesterday.
Of course, I've been doing a lot of work-related, and when I say work, I mean my actual day job.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
So what was I going to say along those lines?
Oh, so I have a real job, and my real job sent me away for two weeks because I had some stuff I had to do in the Philadelphia area.
So while I was out there, I ended up getting to go to a tournament in Jersey at 8 on the Break in Dunnellan, a little town there.
Thank you for watching!
Get kind of close to the machine when there's all those people in there Because the area, it's kind of like when they have tournaments at Sunnyvale Golf Land To put it in perspective for you guys Like there's aisles in between the machines They didn't really have, and that kind of surprised me Because I kind of thought, well they have this area with the pool tables Why don't they take the machine and move it into the back area Where there's all this extra room and move the pool tables around But for whatever reason they didn't do that So I got to see in the group too, but I didn't get to play it
And when I saw it, I was just kind of like, well, it's basically In The Groove 1 with different music and a red interface.
That's pretty much, I was like, okay, whatever, I don't really get the huge deal.
But in a way, that's also the exact same thing you could say about Max 2 versus Max, is that it was just, you know, more songs and a red interface.
So I'm not going to fault the game for that, but I can't really give you a full review of the game until I actually play it.
So I will withhold judgment of In The Groove 2 for a little while.
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
And I was kind of like, I was kind of tired because I had a lot going on from the night before and stuff, just, you know, work and everything.
So I didn't really feel like being a social butterfly, so I was just kind of lurking.
And you know what I think is interesting about DDR tournaments on the East Coast, just like ones on the West Coast, is that, once again, there is that guy at the tournament who really needs to learn about showering regularly and using deodorant.
But you don't know who the offender is because there's so many sweaty guys packed in a room together.
And you're like, ah!
So...
That doesn't change, West Coast to East Coast.
Sorry, I don't know what to tell you guys.
That doesn't change.
But otherwise, in all seriousness, I stayed at the tournament.
It looked like it was okay.
It looked like it was being pretty efficiently managed.
But in all honesty, I didn't end up staying much more than 20 minutes.
Like I mentioned, since you didn't get a chance to play In the Groove 2 on the break, In the Groove 2 is actually at our local golf place, Paradise Island.
It just came in.
Did it officially get there?
Officially got there.
Interesting.
I might have to go check that out.
Actually, I have one more thing I forgot to say, speaking of tournaments and arcades.
Shaft 2 is happening.
I've got dates in mind, possible sponsorship from GameStop.
So in mid-November we're having Shaft 2.
Right on.
We'll definitely be a big sponsor of that tournament, of course.
We'll be whoring that tournament out.
And that will be sometime in November, is all we can say right now.
Yes, and working out of hopefully being able to broadcast live.
Basically, Shaft 2 is going to be a DDR tournament and a bowling league tournament.
How's that going to work?
Because there's no... I don't know.
Well, it is at a bowling alley, so there are bowling lanes.
Oh.
Yes.
Get it?
It's at Fireside Lanes.
Oh, I didn't realize it was at a bowling... Okay, well, that works.
I mean, obviously... I was like, how are they going to do bowling in, like, a golf place?
Yeah, actually, we were going to do the tournament at Roseville Golf Land, and we were going to tie ten children down and roll a giant ball at them like you used to see on, like... Roll a Katamari at them so that they stay stuck.
What was that old show they used to play on USA, which was like, you know, Extreme Games with the Stars, or whatever, where they had the giant bowling ball and they'd knock over all the people in the bowling pins?
That's what we were going to do with children.
No, it is actually going to be the legit bowling alley.
And what will it be, DDR Extreme?
Yes, it's on an extreme machine.
All right.
I'm working out details and I just got to get people together.
We should see if there's room to do some type of TV thing and bring in a home version of something.
I want to have like an amplitude tournament.
We'll see.
We'll see what works out.
But, you know, I'm not going to have much time to work on it at the end of the month because, of course, I'm doing that whole getting married thing, so...
MC Groove Dance Craze Miss Attack
What does Shaft stand for again?
Sactamani, which is sort of defunct, but eh.
Sactamani hosts another fabulous tournament.
Another fucking tournament.
You almost said another fucking tournament.
That's what it came from.
So it'll be Sacramento hosts another fucking tournament, basically.
But for the sake of the lovely management at Fireside Lanes, it's fabulous.
Oh, sorry.
And it's always fabulous.
How about frickin' or... Because it's got me in charge of the whole thing.
How about Sacramento hosts another Fireside Tournament?
because we haven't done one before.
That doesn't work.
Host an awesome fireside tournament.
All right.
I will see what I can do about buttering, because the chat room seems to be liking this idea of like an amplitude tournament.
So I will see what I can do about buttering up the one and only DarkSakura to let us do like not only an amplitude tournament, but some really horrible video game tournament.
I also may be coming into a copy of Rez.
Oh, cool.
So maybe Rez tournament.
Or something.
Can you really do a tournament on Rez?
I will be hosting an unofficial Meteos tournament, so bring your DS.
It's on.
Unofficial Meteos tournament.
Anyway, more details on that come November.
Actually, no, we won't give you the details in November, or else you won't have time to plan.
More details to come, like, soon.
And we would love for people to come from all over to support this.
Absolutely.
Later than now.
Yes, later than now.
Anyway.
People can crash in my playroom.
Back to the East Coast Tournament.
I didn't finish my story on the East Coast Tournament.
Why?
Actually, no, it's all right.
I cut you off.
You can cut me off.
It's fine.
It's because we love each other.
DarkSakura has this look of disgust on her face.
No.
No, that's okay.
I just saw Bush intent on change on my Yahoo, so I was like, that was the look of disgust.
You just saw Bush?
Yeah.
Bush intent on change.
Social Security turns 70.
Butthead!
Anyway.
He's not Bush.
Anyway.
Yeah.
Okay.
Sorry, I've been gone for a couple weeks.
Everything's funny.
Oh yeah, the tournament.
I only ended up staying at this tournament for like 20 minutes.
Because I just...
I wasn't competing, and I was just kind of watching and observing, and I didn't know who to root for, because I didn't know any of these people, and I felt really bad, but also I just had other stuff going on, so I just ended up leaving after like 20 minutes.
Except I left with one of our listeners, so that was a cool thing.
One of our listeners, Ranchan,
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
And so, of course, we were all excited because we were going to play DDR on the IMAX TV, as I'm calling it, because it's a fucking huge TV.
And then, lo and behold, your PlayStation 2 wouldn't load anything.
We finally got DDR Extreme USA to work after a little bit, but...
No background movies and you had to wait like two minutes for the song to load.
That poor thing was busted.
I didn't even get a chance to play because the damn thing broke before, but it's alright.
I had fun.
I had fun just being around strangers.
I don't like to wear out my disk drive.
That's why I use my hard drive.
You know what I find ironic is all these people complain about their disk drive not working and it going off the thing.
I have a first model JPS2 that's never had a problem.
and on top of that the whole reason that the component cable didn't work when we were trying to play Katamari at my house was because we didn't have the visual settings set up for component oh yeah I found that out too the first time I tried to do component is that it wasn't set up right anyway
Anyway, so yeah, we were playing Extreme for a little bit, and then we just kind of just hung out, went to a diner and ate, and then left, went our separate ways.
And I went back to the tournament because I thought, okay, the tournament should be over by now, and I'll have a chance to play in the group too, so I can finally, you know, let Loki know how great it is.
And lo and behold, when I got back, the tournament was still going on, and it looked like it was still Perfect Attack.
I think actually what I missed in the morning, they were doing like an exhibition, they were setting up for freestyle, but I missed the actual competition itself.
And it still smelled like armpit when I got back.
Sorry to say.
But again, I'm not trying to pick on East Coast, because it's the same thing on the West Coast.
I'm not trying to make a Jersey reference.
Shut up!
Well, you know why they built the Statue of Liberty facing the way it does?
It's ass-facing New Jersey.
No, actually, everybody bashes on New Jersey, but I rather liked it in New Jersey.
I thought New Jersey was a nice place.
I like New Jersey because that's where Jay and Silent Bob and Kevin Smith and all... Well, I went to Red Bank my last trip to Jersey, so this time I just kind of hung out in Dunnell and a little while longer.
I actually kind of like Jersey.
I don't know why people knock on it, but from what I understand about Jersey, it's the big cities that suck.
and the other big cities in New Jersey that are no fun.
But I had a good time.
You know what else?
I actually went into New York City on Saturday and just walked around aimlessly for forever.
We just walked around
We walked around the Chelsea District, wink wink.
We walked around the area around Grand Central Station.
We walked around Union Square.
We walked around Times Square.
We just walked forever and ever.
Didn't get a chance to play any DDR in New York City, but I loved New York City.
I had a great time.
And I'm totally thinking like, I should just move here.
But I know I won't.
That's just the afterglow of a trip, you know.
I've been once and have not been inclined to go back for a long time.
This was 11 years ago.
The first time I went I was 17.
But everything was too organized.
It was nice to go back and not have a plan and get to walk around just like everywhere.
It was great.
I had a really good time.
I think I'd have a better time.
But honestly, I don't like looking up and seeing building.
I like looking up and seeing a tree and sky.
and breathing air that's not full of dirt.
It didn't bother me.
But this is the weird thing.
I hate San Francisco for that exact reason you're mentioning.
New York City, I loved.
I don't know why.
No, I do know why, actually.
It was the people.
There was a lot of just neat-looking people and neat-looking things.
I went to the Toys R Us in Times Square, which was awesome.
The Toys R Us in Times Square.
I've never been to such a cool-looking Toys R Us.
Did you eat at Roxy's?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
It was so cool.
They had demos for all these upcoming games.
It was almost like going to E3.
They had the Nintendogs demo, and they had a bunch of other demos.
I didn't realize the Nintendogs demo was everywhere at this point in a lot of stores, because I saw it at Best Buy the other day.
But I loved the setup there, and it was not an overpriced Toys R Us.
You would think that the Times Square would have overpriced games, but it was pretty much the same thing they'd charge in any mall or anything.
So I had a really good time.
I do want to go back and spend more time in the city.
Moving there, I think that's just kind of a joke.
I don't think I would actually... That would be highly unrealistic because it's expensive.
It's expensive to live there.
So we'll see.
Anyway...
So I guess that's about it.
You know what?
You know what's funny?
Somebody in our chat room, Sephiroth1215 actually said, brought up the Chinatown in the Groove 2 machine.
I found out about that after I left New York City because DJ Ranma S told me about it.
It was showing me pictures of the machine.
And I'm kind of sad.
I could have gone to Chinatown and actually played in the Groove 2.
But my friend who I was with,
Thank you for watching!
Caution, Dr. Dick
Yeah, I should just go in Dr. Dick Garb or something.
But seriously, this time I dressed, I just blended in, I was just another kid at the thing.
Although, really, I'm probably the oldest person that was there.
But, you know, I swear next time I go I'll... But I have some time off around the Labor Day, but there's too much going on around that time where I might not be able to go.
So we'll see.
We'll see.
Yeah, because someone you know is getting married.
I do, but I need to find out when the reception is because I can plan around it.
The next weekend.
Anyway, let's go to a break.
Now see everybody on the East Coast is telling me all these in the group 2 machines I could have gone to play.
Thanks guys.
This is good to find out about after the fact.
Now somebody's saying you should have gone to Coney Island.
Alright, let's go to a break.
In this break, we're going to hear some requests from the chat room.
And when we come back, we're going to talk about DDR with Fire.
And we're going to talk about some other things that have been going on in the DDR scene.
And we'll talk about whatever else we feel like talking about.
We'll be back after this.
We're going to start it off with a request.
We actually had a couple In The Groove song requests, so we'll get those out of the way.
Oh, this is good too because we want to hear about Loki's experience with In The Groove.
Because you teased something a while back.
What did you tease the listeners with?
That you were going to rent it or that you rented it but hadn't played it?
I have it, and I've played it.
And I was going to tell you my thoughts on it, and we're going to see if they've changed.
Okay, that's the first thing I've ever read.
Because it's very possible that they might have changed, and I could be an indie group lover.
And then again, angels could be real also, but...
You know what, though?
Now, you posted in your live journal something this week about an Apple product and that you liked it.
The G6 or something, right?
Wasn't it?
Or something?
Yeah, but did you... It was the Linux toaster.
It was the Linux toaster.
I was on dial-up.
I couldn't follow links.
So wait, but there was something Apple related, you confessed to liking a lot There was two, there was two things I posted in my live journal There's one that said this, the only viable use for an Apple iPod And it was a story about a woman bludgeoning her boyfriend Which was fake With an iPod, okay If you look it was on the rumor mill And then the second one was a picture of the Apple G6 And it was a Linux toaster Because we all know that the Apple has the processing power of a toaster I hate you
I was bored that day, okay?
We'll be back with Loki's thoughts on Indigree.
Honestly, I am sick and tired of this stupid Apple thing.
Okay, granted, we know that I don't like them.
Do we really need to constantly bring this up that I don't like them?
Because it gets old.
Nope, doesn't get old.
Okay.
Can you see me falling high?
Can you hear me calling you?
Shadows of it pass by You're ready to fade and die We'll love you Forever
Thank you for watching!
Can you see me?
The Beat Is Real Swift It's Groovin'
Maintain the game, the fame of what I see from Ramblin' Ramblin' down here
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
Oh, do it all night, do it with me I'll take you to heaven if you make me feel free, babe Do it tonight, do it all right Just take me and shake me till I burn up inside, oh
May, Haskell, Zaxxon, Salmon
Come on, do it with me.
We're back, boys and girls, here on Orange Launch Radio.
In that break, you heard some varying music there that was either inspired by chat or requested outright by chat.
Queen of Light there from In the Groove, A Minute from DDR Max 2.
And I know that Rini, who requested that song, actually wanted to hear the original, like, old-ass version.
It only takes a minute.
But I couldn't find it.
I could have sworn it was in that giant potpourri directory that I got from your computer, which I think in turn came from a Guana Girls computer.
I don't know why that would have been in there, since that's the original.
I don't know.
Wasn't there one in like way old-ass DDR?
No.
I thought there was.
The original was never in DDR.
I thought it was.
I thought it was in like an old-ass mix of DDR.
No, never.
Sorry, my memory's fading as I'm getting old.
Summer in Belize from In The Groove 2.
That was actually the first time I really listened to that song.
Not too shabby.
I like that one.
That was pretty cool.
Erotic from DDR3rd makes do it all night, because the chatroom was talking about Erotic.
Somebody actually asked what the Dr. Dick thing was all about, and even though I couldn't really play this song because it's a little bit longer, excuse me,
It was actually kind of inspired by an old erotic song called Help Me Dr. Dick, is where that monkey comes from, the Dr. Dick name.
And it's my improv freestyle alter ego.
Let me play a little clip of the song.
There we go.
So that's the song from Erotic, and that's where it came from.
Anyway.
Charum is swearing up and down that that was in third mix.
Let me check my DDR for a minute.
I could swear that... I thought I'd played the original one in DDR before.
It's just been so long.
I'm going to be honest, kids.
It's not really one of my favorite songs.
I'll just check.
Step Mania doesn't count.
I'll check my home version.
Holy crap.
Here it is.
Wait.
I have the third mix soundtrack.
You got it?
Here it is.
That's right.
That's right.
See, you have to hear it.
I have to think of the... I was thinking of the...
and a different one by them.
It's one of those ones I just never freaking played because I didn't like the song.
I love this song.
I didn't like it.
Sorry, kids.
It's one of those ones I always skipped.
Alright, so we fucked up.
Leave us alone.
We're allowed to make a mistake once in a while.
Alright, anyway, let's take a minute.
We're going to have Loki's review now of In the Groove.
Loki, you were mentioning that you... Did you rent or you bought In the Groove?
or you acquired in the groove?
Let me just say I played in the groove.
How about that?
We'll leave it at that.
Okay.
Because I consider it a waste of... I'm going to use it as a waste... Basically say it's a waste of space on my hard drive.
But anyways...
So yes, I played in the groove, I booted it up, tried it, you know, said, okay, what's the big deal about this game?
Played it for a good, you know, a good half an hour.
I definitely gave it a couple songs a try.
My opinion of this game has not changed one bit.
It still sucks ass.
And now I've played it, I can say it sucks ass.
You know, and I'm still debating on buying an actual copy of the game so I can write this game sucks ass so we can give it away, but...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
What kind of songs did you play when you played it?
Were there any catchy songs you liked at all?
I honestly, I can't even, they're forgettable.
That's how bad this game is.
I played a few things, I was just kind of going down the list.
And I don't remember what songs I played and when I played them.
But the step charts to me seemed like something I saw like on Bomani's style in their sim file section.
Like some idiot, just any idiot made them up.
They weren't that great.
I mean, and I was playing it on the most difficult settings.
So I was just, you know, okay, expecting something really cool.
No, I never got it.
And, okay, wow, there's so many modifiers, does nothing for me.
You know, that's just like saying, ooh, look, you know, cereal comes in multiple colors.
Doesn't matter to me, I mean.
Okay, to play devil's advocate here a little bit.
Okay.
What's so freaking great about DDR home releases, then?
The music, for one, all their music in the groove sounded like some just amateurish, very, very amateur sounding music.
Granted, the license stuff was okay.
I mean, it was okay, but it wasn't standout.
It was just, I mean, it's forgettable.
The entire game is forgettable.
That's pretty much what it comes down to.
I mean, you think that
I would be ranting and raving about this game, but even the Unlocked songs were just whoop-a-dee-doo.
I mean, it wasn't that great.
And I saw the preview songs for In the Groove 2 on there.
Wow!
I'm glad to see that they've sure not stepped up.
You know, it's interesting you didn't even like the Unlocked, because I would say probably my favorite In the Groove song with, I think, some of the most fun steps is one of the Unlocks, Anubis.
I know that song's horrid, sorry guys, but I think it's like the most fun...
Thanks for watching!
I've knocked on this game enough, let me see what it is, because maybe I could be wrong about it.
But I'm afraid I was not wrong about it.
It sucks.
It's a crappy game.
That's what it comes down to.
It's another music game.
Granted, if you're really starving for music games, go play it.
But I'm not starving for music games, so I'm not going to play it.
That's what it's going to come down to.
I just didn't like it.
To me, the whole game seemed like, you know, it seemed very, very amateur.
It seemed like just some guy made some homebrew stuff, got some company to publish it for him, and boom, there's the game.
Well, that's pretty much what happened anyway.
I was going to say, that's kind of what happened anyway.
But there's just not the polish in there.
It's just that, and even in the group too, there's not... You're not going to give them a break on the polish thing considering it's their first mix they've ever done.
Red Octane's first game they published.
Rockstar's
DarkSakura,
You know what, as much as I'm trying to play devil's advocate for In the Groove here because I do think the game's alright, the characters thing is kind of, yeah, lame.
But In the Groove 2 and In the Groove 1 really feels to me, just from Observer, remember I haven't played the game yet so I'm not going to give a full review on the game until I actually play it.
But from a glance, from looking at it, it doesn't look any different from Max 2 to Max 1.
And let's not forget Max 2 was actually a real improvement over Max 1.
But what did they do?
They changed the interface to Reb.
Whoopee shit!
And added some songs.
But the game itself was... Well, they also added non-stops and stuff, I think.
Or Oni.
Was it Oni and... Marathons and In the Groove?
Well, they had that on the next show.
I don't know.
Whatever.
But still, though, I mean, come on now.
It's... I don't know.
I even... It's just, it wasn't for me.
Alright, boys and girls, if you disagree with Loki, we will give you a chance to... Well, you know, so what?
You disagree, big deal.
I mean, I gave it a shot.
It wasn't like, you know, I'm talking about nothing here.
I actually played the game, so...
What are you going to say?
Oh, so you don't like it.
You're wrong.
No, actually, it's my opinion, so I'm right.
It's just, you know, it's just not a very good game.
You know, whatever.
I mean, I don't like Pump It Up either that much.
Granted, that game is better than In The Groove because they've put more polish into the game.
Granted, I think the crazy mode is retarded, but
You know, the dance sequences are fun, and the music is okay.
It's different.
And, I don't know, the background movies are actually good, whereas In the Groove is kind of plain.
But, you know, I will actually go on the record saying, and keep in mind I haven't played many Pump It Up games in the arcade.
I've played a various amount.
I actually think In the Groove is better than Pump It Up.
I hate Pump It Up's interface with a passion.
I hate it.
It ruins almost the whole damn game for me.
And to be honest, the music is kind of hit and miss.
There's some great songs in Pump It Up, but a few more misses than hits for me.
I can't play the same six songs.
I don't know.
I can play In The Groove a little bit longer, I guess, to see if my opinion changes.
Your opinion won't change.
Maybe In The Groove 2 is this godly game.
Now maybe In The Groove 2 is a little better.
You'll see.
We'll see.
I don't think so.
That's like saying maybe McDonald's brand new stuff tastes good.
Maybe it's going to be real meat this time.
No.
Alright, well, chat room, if you want to respond to that, we will open up the Skype line a little later.
There's not going to be anything you're going to say that's going to change Loki's mind.
I do have something, though, that we've got to try.
I meant to get here earlier today.
I have acquired a copy of SingStar.
What the hell is that?
The European karaoke game.
SingStar Popstar
Yeah, ThinkStarPop is... Okay, so maybe they altered the name a little bit.
Okay, so you got a chance to check this out.
Well, I haven't got to play it yet, but I meant to bring it over today.
Well, we'll have to check it out next week.
Just like you were going to bring Taiko no Tachigen for PS3.
I was running out the door, literally.
I was like, what time is it?
Ah, shit, I'm going to be late.
Alright, alright.
It's actually something that the creators of the game, or I think it was the distributors of the game, actually emailed us about a while back.
And we've kind of refrained from talking about it because there has been a lot of information on it.
But I actually got a chance to play this game.
And imagine if Taiko no Tachigen and Drum Mania had a baby.
It would be this game called Percussion Master, which is what I got a chance to play over at 8 on the Break.
I actually kind of enjoyed Percussion Master.
When I first was kind of looking at the release that the guy had sent us and stuff, and the fact that there wasn't a whole lot of information, I was kind of thinking, eh, I don't know about this game.
It kind of looks like it's going to be a little cheese bit of a ripoff.
But what makes this game good is that they actually have a pretty solid song list.
Now, granted, they have a lot of covers in it, but that's okay, because Karaoke Revolution has covers too, and they work out really well.
Percussion Master has covers of songs like Goonies Are Good Enough, Mickey, I think there was a Britney Spears song I had to play in there too, and then just some other classics as well.
I don't remember the whole list.
I'm sure there's a song list out there on the internet somewhere.
But it had a pretty solid song list.
I was pretty impressed.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
So you're beating on a pie and two loaves of bread.
But it feels a lot like Taiko, for some reason, when you play.
Because it's like, instead of hitting the side of the drum, you're hitting these little things on the top, where normally it would be a very similar striking motion as I would hit the side of the drum.
So that's why I think I kind of call it very similar to Taiko.
But the interface is very much like Drum Mania, where the notes scroll from the top.
And it was pretty cool.
The only...
I guess negative thing I would be able to say about Percussion Master is that it doesn't seem like there's a whole lot you can do with the game.
And granted, maybe you could say the same thing about Drum Mania, but it kind of seems like, I don't know, with these three drums, and maybe I didn't play songs that were hard enough, but it kind of seemed like, I think this game might get boring after a while.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
We sure are no directions.
That game is just crazy.
You sort of have to guess as you go along.
They have one in Santa Cruz on the boardwalk.
Yeah, it's like, huh?
I think it's distributed by the same people that do the Drumscape game.
Because I remember on their site, I thought I saw something about Drumscape.
But this is not, I didn't see any ties to MTV.
You know what was really kind of funky about this game is that on their high score list, it actually had pictures of the high score people.
because the game actually has a little teeny camera in it that takes your picture, like an eye toy type thing, that takes your picture when you get a high score.
Now, I didn't get any high scores.
Go figure, I freaking triple-A'd two of my songs the first time I ever played them.
They're not really triple-As, but whatever you want to call them.
I got all perfects the first time I played these songs, and I didn't get my picture on the high scoreboard.
I guess my scores weren't good enough, somehow, even though I got all perfects.
Oh well.
Somebody beat me to it, I don't know.
Yeah, to answer the question in the chat, is this the MTV licensed game?
I didn't see an MTV logo on this game anywhere, so I don't think it's MTV.
And there was nothing like Carson Daly wasn't in it, so I don't think there was anything to do with MTV.
Oh, he's not affiliated with MTV anymore, is he?
I don't think so.
I think he's gone.
He works for NBC now, that's right.
He has a show on NBC.
Why are we talking about that?
Anyway.
That's way too much time for him already.
Yeah.
So, I got to play the game, I liked it, I just don't think I could play it every day, but it's a nice, like, it's something that I think I'd have fun playing in between games of DDR.
Now, Taiko no Dachshund for the PSP, it's awesome, it's great, and you were wondering, I'd be like, looking at the game, I'm like, how the hell is this going to work?
Because, I mean, you can't obviously beat the PlayStation with... I was going to say, how can...
When I think of Taiko Nutachijin on PSP, I think about Beatmania on the Game Boy, or on the Wonderswan even, and I kind of like... Beatmania on the Wonderswan was great!
It was digitized.
Yeah, it was, but, I mean, playing with the buttons and the control pad... Nah, the play was missing for me.
It works very simple.
Basically, on the Taiko drum, your main...
The directional pad and the right drum would be the four buttons.
And then the sides are the L button and the R button.
And so that's how the game's played.
And it's really simple, easy to figure out.
The minigames are fucking hilarious.
They're great.
And they get really hard.
And it's a lot of fun.
I'd highly recommend the game when it comes out here.
It's right now only in Japan.
But, um,
It looks really good.
It's a good start for music games, though, on the PSP, because it's done very, very well.
Can't wait to play it.
It has Toxic on it, which I thought was weird.
Toxic, and there was a couple other songs that were really strange.
Is this a Japanese version of Taiko, or is this American?
Yeah, this is Japanese.
And they had Toxic?
I don't remember that being on any of their... They had Toxic on there.
They have We Will Rock You.
They also have, of course, you know, Katamari on the Rocks.
Of course.
And just some other weird songs on there, Ridge Racer and stuff, and...
It was fun.
They have all the sounds you can unlock.
It sounds very similar to the U.S.
release, Taiko Drum Master, but on the PSP in Japanese.
Like the songs you're saying, I'm thinking, yeah, that wasn't Taiko Drum Master.
I couldn't tell you, but it's fun.
I like it.
Interesting.
Wow, we've played a whole lot of new music-based games these past couple weeks.
DarkSakura, did you play any new music games?
No.
Sorry to hear it.
I told you, I've been getting ready for school.
All right, all right.
I've been playing Burnout 3.
That's not really a music-based game, but it's fun.
I'll talk about some.
I've been playing Illuminus, which is kind of like half a music game.
I have all three copies of my puppies on order.
Ooh, ooh, I didn't know that Technic Beat was coming out on PSP.
That's awesome.
What was Technic Beat again?
Technic Beat was that one with the little dude that walked around with all the circles and you'd have to walk to the circle and hit the button.
Yeah, and as a reminder also that DJ Maxx is coming out on the PSP.
That one's going to be weird though.
That's going to be playing just like, I think, Beatmania on the PSP.
It's going to be a little weird.
Interesting.
But cool.
I'm still very excited about it.
Alrighty, I think what we're going to do now is we're going to go ahead and take a break.
And when we come back from this break, we're going to do a little bit of Skype and hear what the callers have to say.
So we'll do that.
First off, though, I want to see if I can find this.
I wanted to play some songs from the new... If I could find it.
Maybe I don't have it.
I don't want to say what it was if I don't really have it.
Nevermind, I'll have to look for that for later.
And also, we'd like to thank our listeners who voted for us for the podcast awards.
Absolutely.
Thank you.
That's right.
Looking at us.
Thank you.
And also, did you know that this week we're featured on the iTunes store?
I saw that.
We're on page two.
Isn't that crazy?
Yeah.
I don't know how that happened, but we're there.
That's pretty awesome.
I'm not going to complain.
Hell no.
Oh, and I have to apologize for last week, or not really last week.
All you had was a headset microphone, first of all.
But the week before last, with Katamari Radio, that we were pretty much doing, because we had We Love Katamari at DarkSakura's house.
Oh, I was going to play music from We Heart Katamari.
50-inch widescreen Katamari.
That game is so much fun.
I love it.
The Namco X Capcom intro looked very cool on my TV.
Yeah, I'm going to probably delete that game just because I don't know how to play it and it's all in Japanese.
Actually, don't delete it yet because I want it.
You need to show me where to get that thing you have.
Alright, we're going to go to a break and we're going to come back and have the Skype line.
We'll be back after this.
Also, DDR with Fire when we come back.
We'll do some Bomani Potpourri in this break.
We'll start off with a little bit of Taku.
Maybe this will perk DarkSakura up, a little bit of Taku.
Yay!
Alright, here we go.
We'll be back after this.
Can you keep me like a nasty girl?
You want a nasty love?
I know that you want it, honey Feeling so much fear for messy hot tea for love You know that I want it
I'm just asking for the real love It's gonna make me feel Take me higher And I'm not proud enough So try to make sure that you feel And I'm proud enough So try to make sure that you feel

Gaming Radio, so uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.
Orange Lounge Radio.
Oh, we're back here with more Orange Lounge Radio.
God, I miss DDR Oha.
That game was awesome.
They should have done a sequel to that.
Oha Max.
Oha Max Survivor would have been the best thing ever.
No.
The new Dancing Stage is actually Dancing Stage Max.
I'm serious.
I know, I know.
This is stupid.
Anyway, they're like, we couldn't think of a better name, so Max.
In that break, Taku with Electro-Tuned, not only 2DX 3rd style, I think it was originally in, DDR 5th Mix as well.
Risky Men featuring Asuka with Mr. T, Take Me Higher.
Asuka, sorry.
What, 2DX 4th style as well as... Wasn't it in one of the DDRs?
5th Mix, DDR, I think?
I think it was one of those unlocks.
Remember how... It was in 5th Mix.
Yeah, remember how 5th Mix had all those unlocks in it?
I think Electro-Tuned was also one of those songs.
Yeah, Electro-Tuned was in 5th Mix.
Cherry with Yesterday.
Boy, we played a lot of songs that crossed over in other Bomani games that break without even realizing it.
Cherry, Yesterday was, was that actually in Parapara?
It was in Parapara.
Yes, it was.
Was it?
It started off with the right arm sweep, left arm sweep, both arm.
That scares me that you remember that.
Yeah, that's like all I remember of it, too.
In 2DX 6-Style, of course.
There was a Para song in 6-Style that wasn't actually in Para Para Paradise.
I think it's the song, Para Para Paradise.
That's it.
That's why I'm getting confused.
You remember that song in 6-Style?
Para Para Paradise.
That song wasn't in.
That song was a pain in the ass.
Anyway, also, a Konami original there, the Metal Gear Solid mix from Beatmania.
Hell, that wasn't the very first Beatmania, wasn't it?
Beatmania 3rd Mix 3rd Mix
Well, first and second were released as one, with the append.
Oh, that's right, that's right.
The Ebisu.
And then there was third, fourth, because... And they were all appends, weren't they?
Yes, fifth.
Until they got to sixth.
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Exactly, exactly.
Nintendo can get away with that shit.
Yeah, we're going to release three different versions of Nintendogs, and you're going to buy them all.
Um, but yet... Okay, Nintendo, we love you, bye-bye.
Exactly.
Okay, Nintendo, just put out another Zelda game, and we'll be fine.
Anyway.
That's how they get you started.
I got told, um, Electro-Tuned was actually in second style.
So I forgot.
I forgot.
You know why?
Because I'm used to playing it in third style PS2.
Give me a break.
No, that's all cool.
Let's see.
Oh, also I wanted to say about the Metal Gear Solid theme.
It's also going to be in the upcoming Beatmania USA, at least if the E3 demo is any indication.
That's a game we really haven't heard anything about for quite some time, but it kind of makes sense because, you know, we've got two DDRs looming.
I'm assuming that Konami staff is kind of busy with those games and they'll worry about Beatmania when those two are out.
I think there was a date change or something about it.
It's still in spring.
I think Miklatov is back on the show next week.
I do think he's planning a trip up here next week.
So although he's been very tight on his NDA this year and hasn't been able to give as much juicy gossip on the show, hopefully we'll be able to get something out of him next week.
At least something.
And also the heads of a bunch of game companies are coming to my work at the end of August.
So I'm going to get this smooth with the head of Konami.
Take those Orange Ones Radio press kits.
I will be taking the press kits.
Hopefully we haven't bashed too many of their products.
We're going to have the head of, what was it, they're going to be, I think Microsoft is coming, Ubisoft, Konami.
Well, there's about 25 invites at least that they're going out to.
Now, tell that Konami dude that they need to release a freaking press release on Xtreme 2 already.
No, I know you're not really going to do that.
Expect a small wave of information in the near future.
Ultramix 3 info
Yes, there was more Ultramix 3 info.
I'm glad you brought that up.
That was also a DDR Freak forum thing.
One of the users on there, who I know I've seen their name before as a show listener, so hello guy if you're listening, that was actually Same who sent the email to Zonk's official website asking if they have songs in DDR Ultramix 3 and to come back, yes, DDR Ultramix 3 will feature a song by Zonk and a remix by Zonk.
Hmm.
I forgot what I was going to say.
I looked back, I had to dive back in the archives in my live journal back in the day.
I remember when I found there was a whole unprotected section of Zonk's website that had a bunch of info.
They had a bunch of graphics and stuff that were used in the song.
They don't have that anymore.
Apparently...
DDRFreak managed to dig up this post that said the forbidden dance dance Basile from the Or If Is release will be in Ultramix 3.
It's a weird song.
Orifice was the folks that did Art of Hot, also.
Orifice is just one of the guys from Zonk, also, if you didn't know that.
Orifice and Zonk are kind of related.
Orifice is just one of the guys from Zonk.
And I think their song, Art of Hot, I think was the name of it?
Or was that another group?
I can't remember.
It's one of those songs, I have to admit, I love the Zonk song in Ultramix 2, but I don't really play the Orifice song very much.
Sorry to say.
I wasn't a big fan of that.
Yep.
So it's very interesting how many folks are coming back.
Oh, I screwed up.
The name of the song is I Spy.
I found a clip of it.
Here it is.
Art of Hot was another band.
That's the Orifice one.
And you can kind of see the similarities there to Zonk.
Anyway.
Rene posted us a link in the chat room on Konami's official website.
They're still saying Spring 2006 for Beatmania.
There's an official little link there.
Yeah, I think it's still Spring.
I'll ask him.
I'll bug him.
Because what's great about, you know, it's just... I don't know.
I know the most about games.
It's just what it comes down to.
Just...
Find out already if Cartoon Heroes is going to be an Extreme 2 or not so we can shut these people on DDR Freak up.
Okay.
Alright.
Anyway, I guess we should open up the Skype line.
See if we can get some calls.
We've had people asking.
Alright.
Well, I'm firing up Skype right now.
Logging in.
Beep, beep, beep.
Here we go.
I should see if there's been any upgrades to Skype recently.
You know you should check Skype's website often because they do fix their program quite often.
They always release new ones.
Did you know, by the way, we have like 61 people on our list on Skype?
I think that's kind of cool.
Okay, so I just logged on to Skype and there's only like five people in.
What's up with that?
Well, we're up and running.
We're ready for you guys to start calling in if you want to call us.
Remember, if you want more information on how to call the program, www.orangeloungeradio.com.
Click on Interact With Us, and it has more information about the Skype line.
And I just dropped my mouse, which is really smooth.
Yes, DarkSakura?
That's what I'm saying I'm about.
Oh, me dropping my mouse, yeah.
Oh, look, we got a call.
Let's take it.
Oh, this is a guy that used to call us like all the freaking time.
We haven't talked to him in a while.
Let's do this.
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Legend of Zaku here.
Hello, Legend of Zaku.
Long time no chat.
I know.
I finally got broadband, so now I can do this.
And I'm in the middle of a storm, so I'm going to try to make this real quick.
Alright.
Congratulations on the broadband upgrade.
Yeah, man.
Anyways, I could vouch for you for the whole In the Group 2 thing.
How so?
Because I've been already playing this game since, what, July?
Last month?
Yeah.
That's all I've been doing, playing in the groove in Coney Island and Chinatown.
So I can pretty much say it's a big improvement from the first one.
Really?
I don't know if that's really vouching for me, but okay.
Item by item, can you name how it's better?
Let me see, Freeze Rules, the fact that, you know, it's just a, you know, with the new cabinet and the fact that the pads aren't as, you know, aren't as just crappy as, you know, as if you were actually putting it in a DDR machine.
Let me state this, too.
Maybe I should have gotten this out because, and this is one thing where I may have said that In the Groove 2 looks exactly like In the Groove 1, because the machine it ate on the break is an upgraded old cabinet, you know, like a DDR cabinet from back in the day.
So...
Two in the group's credit.
That might be part of the reason why I'm feeling that way.
I didn't see a new build.
Most of the in the group two machines are brand new in the city.
Well, I missed them.
Zaku, you should have called me while I was out there.
I was getting my broadband set up last week, so add to that.
I may be coming back.
I may be coming back very soon.
Are you sure about it?
You know Digital Life Expo is happening in October.
I know, but I don't know if I can swing the time off work.
I mean, it's worth it.
Think about it.
What would persuade you to actually go there and bring the rest of the people so that way you can broadcast it live?
It's not about persuading me.
It's about persuading my boss, and I'm sure Loki and DarkSakura feel similar.
DarkSakura.com
Me, personally, I would love to come out there if I can get the time off, which I don't know if it's very likely.
I did see the advertisement about the tournament.
It's tempting.
I think I'd know more people in an NYC tournament.
Hopefully I should be competing there this year again, like I did last.
Let me put it this way, Zaku.
I'm not saying no yet.
I am considering the idea.
Oh, one more thing.
As you already know, we New Yorkers already have an unlocked 2DX11 Red kit.
Yes, I've already played 2DX11 Red.
Where did a 2DX Red go in New York?
This place called Tri-County Fair in Long Island.
Oh, okay.
See, I didn't get a chance to go to Coney Island at all.
I mean, there's a lot in New York City, as you know.
So I didn't get a chance to really do everything.
That's why I want to go back.
It's an unlocked machine, so we pretty much have all the other unlocks, you know, since the kit is straight from Japan.
It's used.
You know, I had heard something about an In The Groove 2 machine that opened up somewhere in Michigan.
Yeah.
and it already had everything unlocked and all these people saw all these new songs they weren't supposed to and then the next day the lock was back on and all the songs were gone and they didn't realize anyway, I don't know I don't know why I thought to mention that I just kind of remembered that right now because I was hearing this story just like yesterday so anyway, I'm just throwing that out there
Yeah, man, that's what's been going on in New York so far.
So this Digital Life tournament that's coming up, is this the one where they're giving away, like, thousands of dollars or something for the freestyle?
Yes, two grand is a grand prize for most, if not all, the events in the first place.
So I know, now, is Digital Life the same one that Frequency went to last year, and we interviewed him after that, and he had had the run-in with, like...
Much music and stuff.
Yeah, I basically told him about how you wanted to interview him and all that.
Yeah, I remember that.
So yeah, I would love to go to that event if I can make it work.
I don't know if I can, but I will try.
See what you can do, man.
We would love to have you out there.
That would be good promotion-wise for Orange Lounge.
Freestyle Twin, I'm going to be entering freestyle, like I did last year
I think I'm planning on doing Swing It from Fifth Mix, trying to dress up like Pee Wee Herman with the platform shoes, red bow tie, the buzz cut, the whole nine yards for that one.
I'm thinking about it.
It's getting close to that.
That's dedicated.
No, I love... I love... Most of the veteran DJs, freestylers in, you know, in the city, basically, you know, they really like that, you know, they really have some good positive, you know, positive impressions on it when I first told it to them.
This would be Legend of Zaku doing freestyle at the Digital Life Tournament.
Oh, God.
That had to be it.
That's about it.
I told you what's been happening so far and what we already have.
Just waiting for October to roll by, pretty much.
So this tournament's going to be big news then, huh?
Yeah, I just hope you could try to pull something.
We'll see, but all you other East Coasters, I know we have other East Coasters listening to the show, make your way out to this tournament, because it's going to be freaking huge, and they're giving away money, lots of it.
Money, money, money.
Yeah, loads of money being given away.
Just at least try, man.
If someone buys me a ticket and it's on a weekend, I'll do it.
It is, the tournament's on a weekend.
It's on a weekend.
Someone buys me a ticket for Friday and flies me back Sunday.
I'll go.
JetBlue's got reasonable rates.
You don't want to fly Friday and Sunday.
I mean, it's all day flying.
With the time zones changing and everything, it's all day flying.
I don't need sleep.
We'll see what happens, Zaku.
We'll have a meeting on it.
Okay?
We'll have a meeting.
All right.
Take care, Zaku.
Have a good one.
Later.
Bye.
Skypline's open if you want to call in.
www.orange.com.
I was going to mention.
Don't interact with us.
Freeze Rolls, you know, that's really innovative because I've never seen that in another dance game, like Pump It Up or anything.
Stop.
You know, we're getting constructive feedback in the chat room that we're really mellow tonight.
Oh, I forgot to mention, I need a picture of me doing this show.
Why?
Because they're doing a little article about us in my...
Was it the, our kind of in-company magazine thing?
They want it because, you know, they're Can we just grab a screen capture of you from the No, I look retarded.
I don't want the retarded pictures.
I want a non-retarded picture.
That's what I was looking for.
And unfortunately, every single picture I've taken of, you know, me has been a retarded one.
I'm not retarded, so why do my pictures come out retarded?
That's what I want to know.
Oh yeah, picture of my foot.
That would be perfect.
Send the picture of your feet from the second movie.
No!
What?
Okay, now, Loki, we've just had a bit of anger, so DarkSakura, let's further us down the un-Mellow spiral.
There's somebody on the Gorillas board I post on.
I've been, by the way, made supermod on Gorillas Unofficial, which I'm very happy for.
But there's a person who, I'm not going to name names, but who posts 75 posts a day on average.
Does their name start with the letter S?
No.
The letter T?
No.
But there's a thread on here that says, describe the person above you.
And he put, does not love Katamari or his cousins.
I'm sorry.
He's the prince.
His name is not Katamari.
Ugh.
It just, people frustrate me.
It's video game related.
And you want to know what, though?
This isn't the only person that I have seen say stuff like this.
On a variety of boards.
They think that the primary character in a game is named after the game.
After the game.
Like, did you know that when you play Legend of Zelda, you're actually playing Zelda moving around?
Who thought that?
I know, I know.
But it's just... I would say that people, if they're going to be a fan of the game, actually know something about it.
See, in some cases you luck out because in Super Mario Bros.
you actually play as Super Mario.
Yeah, but I've heard people call Luigi Mario too.
And Green Mario.
This is back when.
Green Mario.
Yes, I kid you not.
All right.
I dug this up and I had to play it because it's been like three weeks since I've done this, so I need a little pick-me-up.
I need a little bit of Unmallow here.
God!
I already know what this is.
Hey, Loki, what do you think about gay sex?
Oh, it's so much fun.
That'll never get old, will it?
Actually, it will get old.
Because there's another joke we used to do the same thing for.
I know.
But then you'll just do something stupid and we'll have something else.
Hey!
I forgot.
Well, I actually didn't forget to mention.
September 11th.
No, we're not using that picture!
Thank you to the chat room listener who sent us that picture of Loki.
Yes, they had to pick the most retarded shot of me and... Sakurina, you can thank for that one.
Retarded, like, one second of the entire 20-minute interview.
It's actually a part of a much larger site.
I can show you this site here.
Yeah, I know, I know.
Those sites irritate the shit out of me.
But it's funny.
No, it's not funny.
I think it's funny.
And there's even a whole thread on DDR Freak dedicated to him in the imaging form.
Oh, never mind, never mind.
I was going to say... Whatever those things are, that internet joke needs to die.
YTMND, but that's not... What the fuck does that even mean anyway?
You're...
It's some catchphrase that started the whole thing.
And it's stupid!
Okay, wait.
But that was not an actual YTMND site.
That was the knockoff YTMND site.
That's actually somebody's placeholder for their real site.
However, we had another listener head on over to YTMND and actually came up with this.
And I'm loading this up right now for the chat.
Or for DarkSakura to... I'm not looking at it.
Yes, you are.
It's really funny.
Those things give me headaches.
I kid you not.
Oh, where's the graphic?
Hey, Loki, what do you think about gay sex?
Oh, it's so much fun.
Hey, Loki, what do you think about gay sex?
It actually shows Loki having gay sex.
Hey, Loki, what do you think about gay sex?
Oh, it's so much fun.
Hey, Loki, what do you think about... Yeah, and a picture of me drunk.
Anyways, September 11th, I'm going to be getting drunk here.
You're the man now, dawg.
That's what YTMND stands for.
I think it's something that Randy Jackson said once.
And by the way, I'm not trying to be mean about anybody.
I just had to vent for a moment.
Oh, yeah.
I made a public correction.
Okay, so September 11th, you're going to be drinking because it's your birthday, right?
So do you have the day after off work or something?
Yeah, sure, whatever.
All right, fine.
Okay.
Yeah, I actually had to load that YTMND site in Explorer.
It doesn't work in Firefox.
Because Firefox is smart to block those things that repeat the sound files over and over and the graphics over and over.
You know what, though?
Those things, it's like when they would give those, you know, when to entertain a blonde turnover, when to entertain a blonde turnover, it's the same type of stupid things.
You know, I did see a really, really funny one, though, once.
And it was the... I don't even know if I should repeat this on the air.
But it was that screen capture from Mike Tyson's Punch Out.
Remember when you would, like, beat a stage?
It would show, like, Little Mac in training, and he's running through, like, the streets of New York.
And it shows his coach, which was this really big, fat, black guy, remember, that, like, Al Roker used to be, that was on the bike, that was kind of riding in front of him and pacing him.
And it's...
It's, nigga stole my bike.
And it's just really funny because that's not really what's happening in the picture, but then when you look at it in that perspective and it shows a little animation, it kind of looks like it.
That the guy stole his bike.
Those things don't amuse me.
That's the funniest one I ever saw.
I think that those are meant to amuse the easily amused.
And I'd say complex amusement.
I need something with more substance to amuse me.
What do they call those?
You have snobby humor.
I can't help it.
You're stuck up when it comes to your humor.
I did the little humor thing in my live journal.
Anyway.
Enough about YTMND.
An enema.
Yeah.
Speaking of Mark Caldwell... I had to make a Batman reference.
Have you seen... Well, Walken was in one of the... Walken for President!
I was just going to bring this up.
This is this big internet site that's been going around the internet.
Walken2008.com or .org.
You know what?
I'm not going to... I'm sure it's fake.
Yeah, I was pretty sure it's fake.
But the thing is, if something like that were to pass,
First of all, you need to make sure that if they're going to, if somebody's going to run for president, put all of the issues up there first and foremost.
That site was very, very poorly done.
Very poorly done.
Well, the domain register or whatever was like Lola Skates or whatever.
Lola Skates.
So, yeah.
Alright.
Anyway, I think it's about time we get into the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match.
How's that sound, kids?
Sounds terrific.
Why not?
Okay, so which song of mine did we use last week that won?
Whatever the first one you put in there was.
Okay.
On the disc.
I gotta remember.
I hope, uh... We could just start over.
Yeah, I'm in trouble because I don't know if I remember which song it was.
Well, let's start over.
Do you have any idea what song it was?
Fuck if I know.
What are my choices?
Shit, somebody in chat help us out.
I'm sorry, Rob.
You didn't like the song, I assume.
No, because it sounded generic.
Yeah, I purposely put a generic one in there because I knew you'd love those ones.
Oh, this is great.
We should do a cowbell mix.
Was it Jet Set in the Name of Love?
No, that wasn't it.
I did that one earlier.
Why don't we start with the Challengers tonight?
That's because you use iTunes.
I seriously don't know what song I had left in the cage match.
So I guess we'll start over.
Fine.
So we'll start over tonight.
So I gotta find a song, and while I find a song, we're gonna start off with DarkSakura's pick, because it's the only one I have ready to go.
So DarkSakura, what did you pick tonight for tonight's game match?
I put it in the afterbirth before, not the afterbirth, the fortune cookie.
But I couldn't think of anything else and MC Chris is just awesome.
So it's MC Chris with Geek.
Alright, song number one in tonight's cage match, MC Chris with Geek.
Here it is.
Enjoy.
I'm a geek, spread G-double-E-K, I beat my boys in the basement about every day, a card table called
Costumes and their cops, otherwise known as the motherfuckers touch the tit If I was Wolverine, you'd hear my knockers go stick, I'm not perfect The big false picture, Peter Parker, always tripping, drop my tray in front of the girl that always fucks with I got brains, fucks, B's and C's, I got a grade point average higher than Henderson and your Z-boy Take it on me, because I'm a B, I'll take to you, you'll take to me, well one day
Thank you for watching!
Thank you for watching!
The Dragon died from a heart attack You may advance and you're up to armor class Being a geek, it ain't so bad I can't get laid, I got your pantomime stashed In a mind jam-packed with sci-fi facts Dread knocks, rock down a bike, kick ass Stop hanging on me I love you I'm hanging on you
Thank you for watching!
I'm a geek, I'm strange to you, you're strange to me Well one day, I'm gonna pack you, your brain is on the wall My face, my face is on TV, because I'm a geek I'm strange to you, you're strange to me Well one day
All right.
Song number one in tonight's Cage Match, MC Chris with Geek.
Remember, you guys will be voting for your favorite, and then that winner will go into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio.
But we'll give you our opinions first and try to sway your vote.
So, DarkSakura, it was your pick, but what did you think?
It's MC Chris, he gets a 10, just because that song is like high school for how many people ever?
It's the perfect description.
Loki?
I guess a 7.
I just wasn't feeling it.
I don't know.
For me, MC Chris is kind of one of those folks where I think the joke gets old for me.
I think he's kind of a niche guy.
I don't think it's a joke.
I do, sorry.
I give it a 6.
Because it did have a catchy hook, I'll give it that.
And it was, he doesn't have chicks singing in most of his songs, so that was kind of a neat little addition.
Alright, moving on.
Loki, you want to go next or you want me to go next?
Whatever.
You go next then.
What did you pick tonight?
I picked this song from Wipeout Pure.
Hell if I remember what it's called.
How about, let me give you a hint, it's called Onyx by Cold Storage.
Yeah, Onyx by Cold Storage.
It's the first levels music and it's cool.
And it's my fallback pick because I couldn't find shit.
Oh, that's always impressive.
So, yeah, it's not bad.
I liked it, but, you know, whatever.
Alright, here we go, song number two.
Cold Storage with Onyx.
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
Song number two, Cold Storage with Onyx.
Let's see what we thought of that, DarkSakura.
Generic, five, sorry.
Loki.
It gets a nine, because it's better than MC Chris.
I also give that song a six, because I found it to be pretty generic as well, I have to say.
Sorry.
Alright, let's go to my pick, song number three tonight.
Since I can't remember what won the cage match two weeks ago.
Oh, it was something generic.
Yeah, something generic that I would have given a six anyway, so let's just...
Let's just go to a new song.
I'm going to pick this, and I hope that this isn't generic.
I actually decided to not do a trance-type song tonight.
I'm doing something... There's this band I absolutely love, and a lot of America loves this band too.
It's Frow Frow, and you might remember I used to whore the cage match with these guys.
And they had a big song that was in the movie Garden State called Let Go, and it was really big and stuff.
Well, Imogen Heap, who's the singer, she just recently...
I am in love with you.
Enjoy.
I am in love with you I am in love with you, baby I am in love with you Only for the moment Right now, another piece Right now, another piece Just like that, oh
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
Song number three, Imogen Heap, I Am In Love With You.
Let's see if we were in love with that or if we want to break up.
DarkSakura.
You know, I really like her stuff, but it sounded really kind of repetitive.
In fact, a lot of her stuff sounds the same.
It wasn't bad at all, so it gets a 7.5.
All righty, Loki.
It was okay.
It gets a 7.
Um, I have to give that song like an 8, because she does have way better songs on the CD, but unfortunately they're kind of like depressing, like emo type stuff.
No, I don't want, well actually I shouldn't say that, because I want people to listen to this.
It's not like garbage emo music, it's really good stuff.
Hey, garbage is cool.
Yeah, like garbage is cool.
No, but um, you know what I mean though.
But that particular song is kind of um, it's the more upbeat one, if you could call it that, even though the lyrics are kind of depressing.
Uh, so I give it an 8.
Alright, actually no, I give it a 6, so that way I've given all three songs tonight a 6, and that's 666, so that would be cool.
Anyway, yeah I'm lame, shut up.
Let's recap and then you guys can place your votes.
Song number one you can vote for tonight was MC Chris with Geek.
And song number two you can vote for tonight is Cold Storage Onyx.
And song number three tonight, Imogen Heap, I'm In Love With You.
Okay guys, place vote now.
Send a private message to Sky with your vote for song number one, song number two, or song number three.
And we will reveal those votes as soon as we have them added all up.
Loki, this is the part of the show where I'd like to go to you for a sim scene update.
You know, and normally I'd say I don't have anything, but I actually do, surprisingly enough.
First thing is, Food Mix 2 finally has a goddamn date that's going to be released, and that goddamn date will be September 15th.
And what can you expect but 50 new songs, so that's pretty awesome.
So, yeah.
That'll be something we'll be covering a little bit more a bit later on.
The other thing is that TourneyMix 6 Download Pack 1 is available.
I have not actually downloaded Download Pack 1, but it's up there.
So if you go to ddrei.com, you can visit the last of TourneyMix.
I'm sure we're all thankful for that.
And yeah, I think that's pretty much all I had right now.
I know there's some other ones, but I can't remember.
But yeah.
So, Food Mix 2, that's pretty awesome.
Alright, super.
Food Mix news.
Yeah.
I'm excited about Food Mix 2.
Now, see, if In The Groove was like Food Mix 2... It would be awesome.
If Food Mix 2, that's the thing.
It's got polish to it.
I mean, everything, it looks professional.
It looks like, honestly, if they put it in its own game, if Konami were to go to the Food Mix guys and say, hey, make us a game, we'll publish it for you.
It would be a DDR game.
It would look good.
I want to mention this because we hadn't really gotten a chance to yet.
Actually, there's a couple things I want to talk about.
Let's go to this.
This is a story about the Pump It Up US song list.
Apparently, some folks are actually already getting a hold of this game somehow.
I think it's because they're in the industry, so they know people that know people.
But for the rest of us, we get it on the 31st of this month, I want to say, is when Pump It Up comes out.
Get this.
101 songs on the song list.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
U.S.
Known Songs, Name of the Game, Crystal Method, Walkie Talkie Man, Stereogram, I Love You Baby, Pandera, Let's Groove, Earth, Wind & Fire, Little Less Conversation, and Rapper's Delight by the Sugarhill Gang.
Also some K-pop coming over, which I think is kind of cool.
Just a whole lot of other songs.
I'm just kind of scanning through the list, seeing what I can find in here.
Come to Me and Funky Tonight by Klon, of course, are coming over.
Empire of the Sun, Nova Sonic, Boa, Valenti.
Boa, that's cool.
Yeah, I thought that was pretty cool, too.
Let's see, what else is on here that I recognize?
Shake It Up by Rod.
So, you know what guys, just head on over to Beat, or I'm sorry, either BomaniStyle.com has the list, or there's actually a thread in the DDRUK forum as well that both have the list.
Check it out.
I'm actually, you know, even though I said earlier in the show, I actually prefer Intergroup to Pump It Up because I don't like Pump It Up's interface, I still want to give the home version a shot.
I think it might be fun to play at home, and especially with like 101 freaking songs, that's going to be hard to wear out.
So I definitely will check this game out.
and let you know what I think.
I wish I could have gotten an advance copy.
Alright.
So, um, speaking of Pump It Up, we're working on some little extra news we might have on that for a little later in the show.
Also, we gotta talk about DDR with fire.
Well, um,
Dance Dance Emulation, we talked about it a while back.
There was going to be a Burning Man and this fire festival that's in Oakland.
I was just about to get to this, yes.
I've been teasing it like the whole show and now I'm finally getting to it, but that's alright.
It looks awesome from what I've seen gameplay-wise.
It had a lot of hardware trouble though because I guess the pads broke, the thing crashed, all that type of thing.
But I got to see, there's a little bit of footage on the website actually that shows
Yes, actually DDR Freak posted a video about this, and I wanted to show this, if I could get to it, so we could have a little bit of movie nights.
And now, oh darn it, I can't find the video.
Let me, I can bring it up again real fast here.
So you actually watched the video, Loki, of this?
Yes.
And what did you think?
Oh, it was interesting.
The guy in the suit reminded me of the Bunnymen from the Intel commercials.
But, uh,
It was an interesting idea.
I don't know, it's just one of those Burning Man things, because they've got a lot of weird things that they do at Burning Man, and that would be one of them.
You crazy kids.
It looks interesting.
Yeah.
Let me see, let me see.
Because, Jamie, you probably haven't seen this yet, right?
Probably not.
Let me show this to you here.
I can't see through you.
Hold on, I'm going to move.
I've just got to open this up first.
Okay, here it comes.
Oh, wait, we need some music.
We need some music.
Hold on.
Oh, yeah, I have.
Did you?
Oh, here it is again.
Playing a little After the Game of Love.
Then, whoosh, fire!
Whoosh, fire!
Yep, that's pretty much Dance to Assimilation.
Whoosh, fire!
Hey, fire is cool.
DDR whoosh fire mix.
Um...
I'll say it.
What a stupid idea.
I'm sorry.
Now if he really caught on fire and was dancing on fire, that might be cool.
This is somebody's inside joke gone like way, way, way too far.
I'm just waiting for someone to set themselves on fire because they saw him and they blame it on dancing.
I love it because on the DDR Freak story it says, you know, it links to the article and everything and it says, note, we urge you not to try this at home.
You know, like, you know what?
Don't even put the disclaimer.
Let somebody try it at home.
That's Darwinism, kids.
No, it's all good.
You know what?
I want someone to try it at home so I can submit their story to the Darwin Awards.
I don't get it because everybody's talking about this sensation of being blasted with fire and all this stuff.
Or you can feel the sensation of being blasted with fire.
Okay, A. If you want to feel the sensation of being blasted with fire, become a firefighter.
B. If that's not for you or whatever...
Because you're wearing all these protective gear, I mean, I understand that there's that heat sensation or something.
And I'm just knocking on this, I guess, because it's not something I would ever really want to do.
I'm just not interested in it.
Like, I'm also not, you know, just like, I don't really want to visit Central Mexico.
So I'm not going to do it, ever.
I don't really want to play Dance Dance Simulation.
Go out and get laid!
There are more things better than fire being blasted in your face.
Like a good woman.
Go get laid, honestly.
That's what you need to do.
I think a woman co-designed this game.
Some prostitutes are cheaper than DDR.
I'm surprised the whole set up didn't blow up then.
Whoa!
Whoa, did you hear that joke you just made?
Excuse me?
Repeat thyself?
You should have listened in the first place.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
If you want to hear that joke, you can tune in to the rewinds that we have on DVR Freak Radio.
No, no, we would be able to listen to it if someone would remember to upload it to DVR Freak's server.
I've been out a couple weeks, and we will get back in the swing of those very soon.
I think they're playing one from a month ago.
I'm going to shangle you with the mic cord now.
From now on, Loki will be a ghost.
He will be here in spirit only.
When I get around to it.
Anyways, no.
But see, at Burning Man, if it blew up, it'd be good.
I don't know.
Oh, man.
Why?
Why?
I don't know.
I just...
I don't feel like you're really feeling the sensation of fire because you're wearing a protective suit all over.
So it's like it kind of takes away from that.
It's like, feel like what it's like to get shot.
Here's a bulletproof vest, you know?
And you know somebody's going to come up with this, like, dance, dance, you know, South Central, where you've got to dodge the bullets that get shot at you if you miss a step.
Feel what it's like to get married and get kicked in the nuts.
I don't appreciate that.
Yeah, you two are the ones getting married in this next year.
I'm not, so whatever.
Alright.
We're going to go to a break.
When we come back from the break, more stuff.
Also, tonight's cage match winner.
I haven't even started looking at the votes yet, so we'll get to all that when we come back after a quick break.
And I think I have the appropriate song to start us off this break.
So we'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.
Alright!
Y'all put them in!
Get the pressure!
You've had the time to rest!
Which is coming to an end!
And we start again!
One, two, three, FIRE!
Happy New Year!
Happy New Year!
Happy New Year, everybody!
Happy New Year!
Happy New Year!
Happy New Year!
Happy New Year!
I feel you, I feel you, I feel you every way I feel you, I feel you, I say to you every night I feel you, I feel you, I feel you every way I feel you, I feel you, I feel you every way I feel you, I feel you, I feel you every way I feel you, I feel you, I say to you every night
I see you, I see you, I see you every wedding I see you, I see you, I say to you every day I see you, I see you, I say to you every day I see you
Thank you for watching!
I'm living through the mist of love to find the place my heart belongs I'm living through the mist of love to find my place my home
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, DJ Ranma
Orange Lounge Radio Mamani Music and more Howdy kids, welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio
and in that break you heard some Fire from Disney's Rave, Happy Wedding from 2DX7Style, Lion Musashi with Thunder from 2DX8, and DJ Doc with Pump It Up, I'm sorry, with Run To You from Pump It Up.
I read it backwards, sorry.
Anyway, I want...
We did that at karaoke on the E3 trip.
What?
Run to you, because we went to a Korean karaoke bar.
Oh, you went to a Korean karaoke bar.
I remember the Korean arcade at Cyber Beat, but you didn't go to Cyber Beat, did you?
No, but we went to a Korean karaoke place.
And actually, I did a song off the Japanese list, but it was all in English.
It was Boa.
Ah.
I...
Can't forget at the Korean Arcade, the Cyber Zone, I think it's called.
I hope it's still around.
It was a cute little place.
Where they were having this tournament.
They had karaoke booths in the back.
But it was the kind of thing where you'd lock yourself in and you'd put in a couple tokens and you could sing a song.
And I swear to God, Rice Princess and I were in there the entire tournament.
We probably missed the whole tournament thanks to those karaoke rooms.
I was singing Cyndi Lauper and I was singing, you know, just everything.
Everything.
It was fun.
And it would grade you when you were done, which I thought was kind of weird.
Well, yeah, but that's like almost typical of just about every other karaoke thing I've done except for the ones like where we normally go to karaoke.
Yeah.
Anyway, I actually wanted to mention something about Pump It Up.
We actually have a little bit of an exclusive here.
So we have a tip from our buddy Maple.
He's sharing this with us so that we can tell you guys that Banya, with the song...
And I'm going to fuck up the pronunciation of this.
Ni-sance, N-A-I-S-S-A-N-C-E, Ni-sance.
Ni-sance, I don't know.
Ni-sance.
Ni-sance.
This song will actually be unlocked in survival mode in Pump It Up.
So that's not on any of the song lists that are already out there.
So go figure.
If you didn't know, the way that Pump It Up, the home version works, it's got like different modes.
Home mode has no life bars in it.
The arcade mode is like the arcade.
But survival mode, when your life bar runs out, you lose.
So there's these different modes you can play that kind of alter the life mode.
Am I playing the right way?
You will get this new Bonnie song.
You know what?
If I was any good at Pump It Up, I think I would dig the one that doesn't have a life bar.
Yeah.
I'm going to... I'm going to...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Something else I wanted to share with you guys, an anonymous tip from the chat room.
Well, not so much an anonymous tip, actually.
This came to us from, I believe, Dark Knight sent this over to me, and if I messed that up, I'm very sorry.
This was a link on IGN.com, actually, that talks about a preview for a new Nintendo DS music game from the people that made Guitar Man.
Osu!
Tatake!
Oendan!
Let me see, let me see, let me see.
Excuse me, I'm using the laptop.
Yeah, I saw that one.
It's weird looking.
Well, how so, Loki?
It looks like... Tatakai.
Tatakai means fight.
Oendan, I'm not quite sure, but it means, hey, fight something.
Alright.
It looks funny because there's like these three guys dancing and stuff, and there's this guy that looks like yelling at them, and I don't really know what that was.
I was just based off the pictures that I saw in there.
Interesting.
Basically, it involves three soldier-type guys that are going around the town, and they motivate people with manly poses, but it's up to the player to control just how well that they can motivate.
So it's kind of like a follow-the-pattern-type challenge, and it matches the beat of the song that's being played, of course, using the touchscreen.
During the song, a series of numbered circles pop up on screen as the player is tasked to tap the circle to the rhythm of the song.
TechnicBeat is confusing.
Yeah, but this song sounds like it's just you tap on the right circles.
So that should be interesting there.
But that's not it.
There's also pathways in the game where you don't just tap.
They're a little bit longer of a beat.
You have to tap and drag your stylus to the beat.
It's like a virtual volleyball, one end of the path to another and back again.
So that's kind of the guitar-managed part of it.
That should be very interesting.
Rob, spell that last one for me.
O-U-E-N-D-A-N?
O-U-E-N-D-A-N, yes.
Okay, I'm going to see what that means.
Alright.
Okay.
Alright, let's get to tonight's cage match winner, boys and girls.
I know you've been waiting a while to hear it.
Tonight's cage match winner was won by one vote.
And I have to say tonight, kids, not a lot of votes tonight.
I'm very pissed at your apathy.
But for those of you guys that did vote, thank you.
They're being too emo.
Yeah, I guess so.
Maybe they were too wrapped up in the emo chick song.
Unfortunately, that's not the song that won tonight.
The song that won tonight was...
Onyx by Cold Storage with one vote over MC Chris.
Sadness.
Hooray for generic.
Hey, I don't have to pick a song next week.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, rub it in.
Rub it in.
Alright, and to those of you guys... I think, though... To those of you guys who didn't vote, poop on you.
I think going into that, though, I think that it's highly appropriate to have, uh... You know...
DarkSakura
I've never put that in there for you since you never seem to be able to find it.
Thank you, I appreciate that.
We're going to have to do this next week.
I have some funny music that you can use for game show stuff.
I put it on my card especially for you guys.
I'm sorry, this isn't about ranting.
Fight, Kill, Blood Makes Grass Grow
Actually, that used to be our homecoming chant every year because our rival school for homecoming was McGill.
So it was Kill McGill.
Blood makes the grass grow.
This used to be our cheer.
And this kind of ties into the next segment here.
So I'll kick it off with a little cheer.
I'm going to kick off tonight's FU's with a little cheer.
You're going to be our cheerleader.
Yes, I am.
Okay, ready?
Has it already been broughten?
Yes, I'm broughtening it right now.
Okay, give me a cue.
Cue.
Give me a cue.
Cue.
Give me a cue.
Cue.
Give me a cue.
Shut up.
What's that spell?
4Q!
You know what?
We had one.
Rob.
What?
Give me B. B. Give me another B. B. Give me another B. B. What's that spell?
3B?
You're retarded.
That was a band cheer, okay?
Okay, why are we doing the 4Q of the week?
Because we're full of emo.
My first F.U.
goes to people who like generic crap.
My second F.U.
of the week goes towards just being given random assignments at work and then having to go back and do everybody else's stuff because certain people decided not to come into work that day and aren't going to be in the next week.
So I get to do it again, yay!
F.U.
goes toward...
Having to basically do a lot of the wedding crap on my own, although I've been getting a bit more support as of late.
Well, it's not really that I'm doing it on my own, it's just that there's certain things about it that are more important to me than they are to the other party in my wedding.
You guys should do a reality show about my wedding.
No!
Hell no, okay?
Hell no.
This is close enough to reality.
More like unreality.
Another SU goes toward the fact that Dan lent our Xbox out to his friend and I've been sort of having the urge to play Halo 2 even though I get sickening... I get motion sick on that game.
But I want to go back to the Earth level and run all over the rooftops.
and, uh, another F.U.
goes to my puppy demo for only being five minutes long, because I love playing Frisbee with puppies.
You don't have much longer to wait.
And, uh, what the... Something for the podcast, sorry.
Sorry.
Um... I just had a tiny little fanboy orgasm, though.
F.U.
goes to Loki for showing Rob Crabtor my F.U.
Excuse me, it's my moment, okay.
Um...
Animal Crossing DS needs to be out like now.
Dude, when's that supposed to be out?
Eventually.
November.
Aw, fuck them.
F you to not being able to register for my wedding.
Because, you know, I want to register and all this because, you know, I don't care what people say about, you know, don't send me gifts.
When you get married, people feel obligated to give you a present.
You know, it's just how things are.
So, I want Amazon gift certificates.
And that's it.
How many toasters do you want, seriously?
We don't eat bread.
Exactly.
I don't fucking need a toaster.
So, yeah.
As you to the traditional ideas of having to give people, like, household goods for their wedding, just give me Amazon gift certificates.
I'll be happy.
That's it.
Let DarkSakura save up so she can buy many copies of the Kama Sutra.
I don't need that.
Oh, why would you need many copies of it?
You know, just to have in various rooms of the house.
Loki's turn.
Well, you know, the only thing I have to say fuck you to is the people that stole my fiancé's car because that sucks.
I wouldn't want that happening to my car.
But I was right, wasn't I?
Luckily, my car has a security system, so, you know.
Gamey.
And then, um, fuck you too.
A lot of the games out there are just sucking ass.
Especially, like, for example, Petite Copter 2, which was a waste of my time.
Don't import that game ever.
It looks strange, but not strange enough.
And, um, yeah, and also fuck you too, that stupid, um, Jack whatever his name is.
I don't even want to, you know.
Jack Thompson?
Jack Thompson!
The idiot?
Freaking idiot.
Oh, no, no, no, I'm gonna bring up later on about VG Cats.
But he, you know, he just has to go out there and just, you know, perpetuate the let's not blame the parents for our kids' problems, let's blame someone else stereotype.
So anyways, to hell with him, I hope he dies.
In some ironic way that has to do with video games.
I'm done.
An F you to Nintendo for not having Animal Crossing DS out like now.
An F you to the fact that they're not putting the classic Nintendo games in there because they found out they can make money from it the other way, so you can suck it.
An F you to the fact that I was gone for so long, although I did kind of enjoy the East Coast.
I really missed home, and I missed people, and yeah, all that.
I miss you guys!
But my aim's improving.
You owe me rent on that, you know.
I used to have that bumper sticker on my car like years ago when I really hated my ex.
We're friends now.
Anyway, none of that matters.
I don't know, just an F you to the fact that I'm... An F you to the fact that I've got a lot of drama going on in other places that don't have to do with the show or anything.
But I can't really say it on air either, so just an F you to all that drama going on there.
And an F you to... An F you to...
Me, because I have nothing else to say.
Stuff, angst in general.
You'd think I'd have a lot of more FUs for my travel, but I really don't.
Just an FU to Southwest for being a crappy airline.
By the way, I'm going to change my FU theme, because I have to go find it to download, to the Mighty Mosh and Emo Rangers theme.
Whatever, maybe we should all change our themes again.
I don't know, we'll see.
Alright, let's move on, boys and girls.
I made a funny in the song I picked for chatroom FUs tonight.
See if you can catch the joke.
Misty says, fuck gas prices.
They're currently at around $2.53 a gallon here right now.
Hey, $2.69 in my neighborhood, honey.
You should have picked Tetra Q, though.
And I heard it's going to jump to $3 tomorrow or the next day.
Do I have a justifiable reason for not wanting to drive now?
Fuck cage match, too, and I want a copy of Geek now.
Legend of Zaku says F you to the Iraqi insurgent who capped one of my school's student soldier to death last Sunday.
And F you to President Bush for making that situation possible.
F you to all the thunderstorms we've been having tonight, thus taking out the power in my house for a little bit.
And F you to my cable provider, Cablevision, for providing shitty digital cable that gives me channels with piss-poor lag and pixelation.
Tomokun says, fuck my iTunes library for corrupting itself and all but one song not recovering.
The acapella to Feel Good Inc.
was the song that got saved.
You saved it?
Send it to me, please.
Chimera says, F you to not having enough money to buy cool stuff like ATHF DVDs and Napalm.
Socorina says, F you to Jack Thompson for being the biggest fucktard on Earth and causing havoc worldwide.
Dark Knight says, my FU goes to my job for driving me insane.
Another to being broke, and finally to gas prices.
This has gone too damn far!
Dirty Thief says, F you to my damn boss for giving me six extra hours of work.
F you to traffic, thunderstorms, and other shit that ruins my Sunday night, including these damn electronic shit.
And F you to damn wet streets merely making me hit a poor dog.
Fuck that.
My friend almost hit a cat the other night when we were driving in Pennsylvania.
Oh, it was the saddest thing ever, and he almost had a heart attack.
Don't hit animals on the road.
Didn't try hard enough.
DarkTetsuya says, Amen to Loki.
Fuck you to Jack Thompson.
Surely you have something better to do?
Oh, and Tomokun says, No, the one that didn't get saved.
I screwed up.
Oh, so Feel Good Inc.
Acapella didn't get saved.
I'm being assisted with that, and I will be happy to share.
Oh, good.
Misty says, Yes, I know that I'm still getting off easy right now, but I still wanted to bitch about it.
Well, okay, fair enough.
That's what you get to do here on this show, so...
That was the FUs of the week!
Hope you enjoyed.
We... So, DarkSakura, I understand we have some guest listeners tonight, or some folks listening, a pretty large contingent from some sites?
A few of the people from the Gorillas Unofficial chat's listening in, so hi guys, thank you for listening in.
We have Bexar and Roz, and I'm trying to remember who else was listening, but if I don't remember, hi!
You get a big shout out from me.
We like it when new people listen.
I'm going to tip the Orange Lounge hat by just giving a little nod with a song here.
We'll dance like they do in the iPod commercials here with the shadows and everything.
I'd rather not dance like they do in the iPod commercials.
You can just keep playing this for me.
Okay, that's all you get.
Sorry.
You know what, though?
That makes me think of this.
I was randomly having lunch in Phoenix yesterday, right?
Jason took me to this Chinese restaurant, and we were watching commercials on TV.
And I saw this one that looked like it was parading that commercial with the feel-good ink and the...
iPod Shadow Dancers, right?
But it was children doing the shadow dancing.
And we were like, what the hell is this?
And it turns out it was actually for like a Kidz Bop CD.
But no, it gets better.
It was actually an all-Christian Kidz Bop version.
I don't remember what it was called.
It was like, wow, that's inspiration or something like that.
Kidz Inspiration or something.
It was Kidz Bop, but
all God music and she was telling you to copy or take to a copyright infringement.
Yes, I thought Thou Shalt Not Steal was one of the Thou Shalt Not Steal copyrights.
You know, we need to actually check the original translation to see what that says.
Actually, point of order, in case you didn't know, the original translation for Thou Shalt Not Kill is actually Thou Shalt Not Commit Murder.
Interesting.
Yes.
See,
I love how much crap they changed.
You know you're opening a whole can of worms when you bring up religion.
I'm not going to open up the religion can of worms.
My God, I mean, we get hate mail when Loki bashes on Max.
We don't want to get religion.
And you know what?
I usually forward all that over to his email.
Oh, good.
I don't get any hate mail.
Exactly, although I did share the funny Mac one with you.
Yeah, well, whatever.
That one was stupid.
All right.
We're going to go to a quick break, boys and girls.
When we come back, we're going to do a little bit of Ask Orange Lounge.
And, you know, I just came back from a trip, and we were kind of off last week, except for, well, you know, there was the music show going on.
But, you know, we haven't had a chance to do some Ask Orange Lounge in a little while.
So here's your chance to ask us something, anything you want.
So we're going to go just to some more music potpourri.
I'll probably do another In the Groove song this break for you folks that are into that.
and I know there's a lot of folks out there that are into this song and we haven't played it in a long time so like it or not, here's some Cartoon Heroes we'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio and Ask Orange Lounge so send your questions in to Sky be a private message
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
and more.
I just made that connection.
I think the guy wanted to hear the Romeo and Juliet song from In the Groove, and I played that one instead.
Whoops!
Boy, did I fuck that one up.
Rob messed up, Rob messed up, la la, la la, la la, la la
Max Unlimited in that break, too.
Is it Minimalian or Minimalian?
I think it's Minimalian.
Minimalian.
Yeah.
Mini-something.
Mini-something.
And then Romeo and Juliet.
By who?
By Lolita.
You never said who Minimalian was.
Oh, Detroitian.
No, Detroitian.
Detroitian.
Detroitian.
That's just a cool name.
Here's that little clip of the other Romeo and Juliet song.
You know, I actually do like this Romeo and Juliet better, too.
Why didn't I think of this at first?
I don't know.
I'm just in a para mode tonight or something.
I don't know.
I can't believe I did that.
Next time, kids, specify the artist if there's more than one song by the name or I might fuck your request up.
I bet that guy's not happy, though, whose request I fucked up.
But, you know, I'm human.
What can I say?
Yeah, the other one.
It was Tomokun requested it.
I know.
I'm sorry, Tomokun.
And he specifically spelled it a different way.
It didn't click for me at first.
I'm sorry.
Rob doesn't care about our listeners.
You know what?
You found me out.
Just because in the groove is forgettable, that's all.
I was waiting for Loki to jump in there with some slamming in the groove comment.
You snubbed my fanboy.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I may have snubbed your fanboy, but I didn't snub your stalker.
I've been reading DDR Freak lately.
Okay, my stalker is scary.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
This Blair is King guy.
Yeah.
DarkSakura, I watched you leave in your car today.
You going to lock another thread today?
I mean, I really do want to thank... Iguana Girl is my best friend.
And, you know, she will...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Fanboy is cool.
Creepy Stalker is not cool.
He sends me private messages saying, you should probably warn this person.
You should probably warn this person.
You should watch this thread.
I send those to Iguana Girl and sometimes you, and I'm not stalking you guys.
I know, but he's like all the time doing it, and I'm like, oh my god, you're a freak.
He might be listening.
This poor guy's probably listening, and you're breaking his heart.
I hope so.
You're breaking his heart.
I'm giving him a solid dose of reality.
It's good.
Good for the soul.
Yeah, it actually does sound kind of like he's trying to kiss my ass.
He just wants to be a mod.
Is that so wrong?
Isn't that what all the kids want?
He wants to be a mod.
Being a moderator on DDR Freak is not all roses and sunshine.
So he can get closer to you.
Don't say stuff like that!
You're freaking me out!
Doesn't he know that the mods on DDR Freak are appointed by God and you can't obviously become one unless you have a miracle?
Actually, if you want to know, we sort of vote on you, moderators.
You have to have three miracles.
And then after that we part the Dead Sea and...
You know, spitnails, shit ice cream, that type of thing.
Fuck no!
I'm proud of myself for that one.
I made that up.
I should be on Whose Line Is It Anyway?
Rene has two queries, one for Loki.
He said queries.
One for Loki.
Since he's playing Star Soldier, does that freaky face that becomes whole mid-level boss still appear in the game?
Yep, every single level almost.
That's that.
Rene says, and one for anybody who has played at E3, I heard that the E3 demo for We Heart Katamari was exclusive for E3.
It was, he even talks to you.
What was so exclusive about it?
He actually said that, yeah, there's this convention with all these people playing this to see my beautiful presence or something.
So it's actually talking about people being at E3.
Yeah, it actually, in the text, it actually talks about, like, oh, we hope you enjoy this E3 demo, you know, and, like, I just remember the E3 was referenced in the King of Cosmos dialogue, and it's kind of too bad that that dialogue will probably never see the light of day in the real world, because it was that same, like, funny writing, quirky writing, that makes Katamari Damacy so special.
So that was pretty much what it was.
That game got delayed till September as well.
Don't!
I'll just say, hey Bradley, you live like, what, five minutes from my house, why don't you come over and, oh yeah, bring Katamari too, you can bring it.
I have an HD loader and HDL dump, you know.
You'll have to come over and show me how to get that set up, by the way.
I have We Love Katamari on an unmodded US PlayStation 2.
If I get a US, if I get the old style PlayStation on a hard drive, can I still get HD loader somehow?
Yeah, there are free versions that are available still.
for your memory card.
And you can even run homebrew stuff and all that wonderful stuff without a mod chip.
Good to hear.
Socorino wants to know, what does Loki think about stuffed penises?
That's the question.
Look at the monitor yourself.
There it is.
Well, honestly, we were going to get Rob an inflatable penis.
And to surprise him, we found it at the adult store.
Detachable penis.
That was at... We went to... We actually went to Gold Club Centerfolds with Rob's roommate and my fiance.
Oh, speaking of Rob's roommate, here comes Extifer right now.
And so my fiance, she got a lap dance.
And the stripper licked her boob.
And then... Well, she was...
I personally had to pay for all three of us, so that was a $150 adventure, in which I got no lap dance and no boobs rubbed in my face, and the cheesesteaks were fucking awful!
What the hell happened?
Lap dance is always better when the stripper is crying.
Yes.
Gay man.
Uh-huh.
Stripper club.
What the hell?
Actually, I used to go all the time, too, so I put...
Your first experience, how was it?
It was great.
There were strippers.
Can I say... You can say whatever you want on the internet.
Oh, I can?
Okay.
I saw a lot of pussy.
And I saw a lot of ass.
And actually, Loki's girlfriend pointed out to me that they bleach their assholes.
And like, they really do.
Like, they seriously do.
Like...
It's like regular skin.
The bigger life of strippers.
Yeah.
And, um, so yeah, a lot of pussy, a lot of ass, a lot of boobs.
But I didn't get boobs rubbed in my face either.
Me neither.
I'm telling you, okay, all three of us were sitting at the goddamn rail.
I was tipping for all three of us because I had to.
And, um, who gets the boobs rubbed in their face but my goddamn fiancé?
You know, as it should be.
I think what we need to do is we need to crop just that little portion of the show right there and have that be the four-year consideration clip for next year's Life 365 Awards.
Just expert going, and some strippers bleach their assholes!
Orange Lounge Radio, Video Game Radio.
We like video games and stripper chat.
You know...
Hi, we're degenerating into bleached asshole chat.
You know, I am almost getting... Which is better than...
I think you just made some of your fans... I think we should honestly use that as a segue to DarkSakura's tip of the week, you know, thing.
You know, if we talked about video games all the time, we wouldn't have time to talk about strippers bleaching their assholes.
Oh my god, it's actually funny, one of our listeners in the girl's chat says she's heard about it.
Oh my god.
Bleached Asshole Chat That's it, that's it.
From now on we no longer have Paris Hilton Chat, we have Bleached Asshole Chat.
Same difference.
I want to go next time too.
I got boobs in my face.
I got boobs in my face last time.
Strippers love gay men.
Now that my ass has broadband, I need some cool things to do besides look at Prawn and the like.
Some suggestions for Zaku now that he's upgraded to broadband.

Go into iTunes and search for OrangeLight.
Did you know we're featured on iTunes this week?
Did you?
Did I mention that?
And then get BitTorrent and download a bunch of Sentai TV.
I was going to suggest online gaming, now that you don't have to develop.
Get into some online games.
Oh my god, you can play Free Ragnarok with me if I can ever get KRO to work.
Try some online games.
Play PSO with me.
I'm wondering when I'm going to actually get back to playing Final Fantasy XI.
All these console games distract me.
Tomo-kun wants to know, why did my brother get a text message at 5am from his job's assistant manager about his penis size?
Drunk.
Gay?
I don't know.
Probably not gay.
American penis so big!
Perhaps he had inquired about his penis size earlier today, and his boss just finally got him around to getting that.
Maybe you didn't hear the whole story.
Maybe that's what's going on.
MJSI24 wants to know, I listen to the podcast mostly, as I can't listen to the live show usually.
Hey, you and about a thousand other people, by the way, in comparing the ratings from a podcast to the live show.
But I'm wondering when you record the podcast.
What are you planning on talking about this week, and what day will it officially be posted to iTunes for download?
We record our podcast, believe it or not, immediately after we do this show, which is why if we ever sound a little worn out or
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
So another fun parents are ignorant discussion.
Should be a good time.
What day will it officially be posted to iTunes to download?
It should show up.
It usually gets posted right after midnight Pacific time.
So early, early Monday morning.
They're supposed to roll out on Mondays.
So when you wake up Monday morning, it should be there.
If not, we had some type of internal problem and we'll get it up as soon as we can.
So that should answer that.
Tomokun wants to clarify he was talking about his own cock, as he put it.
Not Tomokun, but anyway, forget it.
I don't know.
Yeah.
I think that was it.
That was pretty much all the questions we had.
Oh, okay.
I thought we might have had one more.
Did I lose it?
What did I do?
Did I accidentally close the window?
Do we have any emails?
Our emails were all for... Yeah, all the emails we get are the podcast.
No one loves us.
Remember, a thousand more people listen to the podcast than listen to this show.
But that's okay.
So we do this show because we love you guys.
Really.
This is just a labor of love now because we're certainly not getting the ratings.
It smells like fresh podcast in here.
Are you talking about my podcast?
Maybe.
That will never get old.
Never, never, never.
Ever, ever, ever.
All right.
I guess what we'll do now is end the show.
What's so funny, Extifer?
Well, because we're done.
It's 9.29, and by the time we get our final thoughts out and everything, it'll be 9.30, and that's a done show.
And I'm sure the fortune cookie is probably another five minutes, so we're running over anyway.
So whatever.
Who cares?
We're done.
You want more?
Tune in next week.
You want more?
More?
Tune in to the podcast.
Final thoughts, boys and girls.
Loki, or Extifer, you're in the room.
Why don't you start us off?
Loke Extifer.
Extifer, what is your final thought?
I'm in the groove.
Wait a minute, I said Extifer.
Loki, what's your final thought?
My final thought is I have to play a lot more console games this week, and strippers really do bleach their assholes.
Thank you.
DarkSakura.
Actually, I'll give you my final thought.
My final thought is I'm sweating.
It's hot in here and not in the good way.
DarkSakura.
What do I say every show?
Reject false bleach.
Yeah, reject false assholes.
Bleach next time.
You heard it here first.
Reject false assholes.
Only good for real.
100% organic asshole.
Organically colored assholes.
We are ending this show now before this joke goes on a little too far.
Too late.
Tune in next week, kids.

Final word of the show.
I'll give it to Eksta for one word to sum the whole thing up.
Ass.
And now, here is your fortune cookie message of the day.
I'm in love with an electric man An android Adonis with a yellow tan
I'm such a fan, oh how I dream about this wired man He's so logical, he's so clear We'll get it on and light you from here He's such a turn-on, this space-age man My luminous lover, my electric man
There's something about a positronic man The touch and the feel of his plastic hands I go wild when I see his eyes Of gold and a glowing from inside Oh robo lover won't you kiss me please Your tongue has never failed to stimulate me Oh wham bam a thank you man
Electric Man You know he's fully functional, I tell ya You know he's fully functional, I'm sayin' You know he's fully functional And if he ever gets too hot, well I can always switch him off Oh baby, oh
Thank you for watching!
Thank you very much for listening and we'll see you next week.
That's it.
Show's over.
Fade to black.
Piss off!
Go home.
Closing time.
You don't have to go home if you can't stay here.
Bye, kids.
No more bleached asshole jokes!
It's time to bleach your assholes!
