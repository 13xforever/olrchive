238567	244360	The following live program is a special presentation of Orange Lounge Radio.
264754	272457	On tonight's program, ladies and gentlemen, Orange Lounge Radio is back for episode number 153.
274017	277939	After taking last week kind of a mini-vacation.
277959	281260	I mean, there was still a show, but it wasn't the show-show, right?
281520	282040	I was there.
282441	285802	You were there, but it wasn't the OLR experience, so to say.
285842	290363	It was the DarkSakura... We were recording the podcast while we were broadcasting.
291904	293865	So it was the Let's Multitask show.
293965	294025	No.
295228	300172	Anyway, tonight, though, I'm back after being gone for two weeks, because I know there was a show a couple weeks ago.
300232	301033	Did you enjoy your box?
301353	303295	I enjoyed the FedEx box immensely.
303355	304376	I was popping on the Bubba app.
304817	308900	So on tonight's show, we're going to talk about my East Coast tournament I went to.
309020	311803	I went to an East Coast tournament, and I saw it in the group, too.
312603	313804	So I can't wait to talk about that.
314285	317588	And also, we're going to talk about the DDR with fire.
319229	321131	DarkSakura's favorite thing, DDR with fire.

490680	496966	Jamie Summers, Dark Sakura, and the DDR Freak Moderator of the Month, might I add.
496986	498507	Yep, that's true.
499928	500388	I'm not sure.
500408	501069	Turn that on.
501249	501650	Make sure it's on.
501670	502070	It is on.
504414	505815	It's on, but very quiet.
505855	506855	I don't know what's going on over there.
507215	507395	Weird.
507435	507616	Here.
508036	508916	Shit.
510897	512058	Okay.
512458	512958	Canter that one.
513078	513538	See if that works.
513959	514299	Sorry.
514459	514999	Sound problems.
515099	515960	Are you there now?
516240	516560	I'm here.
516620	516840	Hi, guys.
516860	517300	There you are.
517680	518181	That's weird.
518441	519541	Okay, we'll fix that during the break.
520182	521222	Also, here is Loki.
522003	522363	I am here.
523443	524064	Barely.
524424	525704	You ran in during the intro there.
525724	526305	We were worried.
526625	528926	I was looking for a song for Cage Match, and...
530123	532204	Oh shit, I gotta get a song for Cage Match, don't I?
532224	534265	That's what I've been doing for the last two hours.
534685	535065	I did?
535125	538246	You just never left instructions on how to upload the damn thing.
539467	539887	I won?
539927	540667	How'd that happen?
540747	542788	Alright, I picked a song at the last minute.
543128	543808	Alright, well, whatever.
544189	544469	Cool.
544909	545929	Good, I don't have to pick a song tonight.
546389	546690	Alright.
547710	547890	Good.
547910	548850	A little stressed there.
548870	550251	That's fine.
550791	553612	That's alright, we'll figure out a contingency plan.
553632	555073	We'll put it in double or something.
556502	563326	Alright, so anywho, we're gonna go to a quick break featuring some music from the DDR while we figure out what happened to Jamie's microphone.
563846	569089	And also, we'll just, you know, get comfortable and get ready to do some chatting.
569980	571381	We're going to talk about fire tonight, Loki.
571981	572341	I know.
572861	573982	You know that's coming up.
574482	576323	I'm going to talk about In The Groove, too, as well.
576864	579185	I have In The Groove, actually.
579545	583407	Oh, I heard that this came up while I was gone, so you've got to fill me in on this.
584647	587389	We'll be back after this quick break featuring some music from Dead DDR.
587689	591191	Actually, this first song is also an In The Groove song, kind of, sort of.
592051	592571	Kind of, sort of.
592591	593332	We'll be back after this.
596106	597328	Thanks for watching!
692780	716098	I just did my own love for you I need to know, I need to know, I need to know how you feel I gotta know, I gotta know, I gotta know if it's real I need to know, I need to know, I need to know how you feel I gotta know, I gotta know, I gotta know if it's real
723633	726574	I'm giving all my heart to you, my love I justify my love for you
749256	752337	I'm giving you my heart, my soul, my love I used to cry my love for you
867959	869702	It's a long way to go, honey.
870824	873287	I know, but I'm afraid.
873307	875731	Where are we going?
875771	878375	Into the Dark Black Forest.
953637	956239	into the dark, black forest.
982819	983319	I'm back.
983499	985700	I'm back from my trip that I went to the East Coast.
985780	988921	I was sent in FedEx packaging, courtesy of Loki and DarkSakura.
989061	990842	I'm glad that they treated you well.
991162	998584	You know, they actually lost some of our shipments the other week, so I was like, hey, he might be gone.
998744	999745	We might never get him back.
1000285	1005047	Actually, FedEx was full, so I had to suffer a fate worse than FedEx.
1005107	1006327	I had to fly Southwest.
1007369	1007989	Thanks for watching!
1024185	1029410	Oh lord, try spending five hours on a plane with Grandpa, who's really, really obese.
1029470	1037638	I mean, you know, not that there's anything wrong with being really obese, but when you're trying to sit next to me on a plane, it's like, you know, I've got no wiggle room whatsoever.
1037658	1038899	So what were your in-flight movies?
1039620	1041762	It's Southwest, there is no in-flight movies.
1043023	1044244	There is when you bring a laptop.
1044544	1045605	Yeah, I brought my PSP.
1045766	1049229	I'm going to talk about that on the podcast, because I did bring my PSP, and...
1050160	1054583	Sharks Girl, if you're out there, I love you, because she loaned me movies I could watch on my PSP.
1054903	1061047	And I've always knocked the idea of movies on a PSP, but I take it all back after this trip.
1061087	1062008	I take it all back.
1062088	1063029	I am so sorry.
1063169	1069533	I'm so, so sorry for those comments, because seriously, it saved my ass this week, so I'm very happy.
1070529	1078851	So my in-flight movies were Tron on the way over, which, believe it or not, I'd never seen before, and iRobot on the way back, on PISP, the PSP.
1079391	1092835	So, um, but it didn't stop this grandpa guy from trying to talk to me in his little, not just grandpa, but, um, the daughter, or the grand- the daughter, the granddaughter was in sixth grade, that was kind of one of those, like, scary-looking children.
1093271	1096913	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1122182	1123362	The tiny ass screen.
1123402	1129204	If you thought watching a movie on your PSP was bad, these things have the tiniest screen in the world and the quality just stinks.
1130545	1130845	I don't know.
1131225	1136807	Anyway, so she was showing off her computer to me and kept asking questions about the PSP and I'm just like, leave me alone.
1138348	1139708	Pretend you didn't speak English.
1140208	1141349	That's what I need to do next time.
1141389	1143469	Just bludgeoned her to death with the PSP.
1144690	1149812	That's why I need to go see that movie Red Eye because maybe I'll get some ideas from that movie for the next time I go.
1150472	1151032	So we'll see.
1151591	1155532	I don't know if we should support any more of Wes Craven's stuff.
1155572	1156173	I mean, come on.
1157153	1160934	Do we need to really inspire him to make more Nightmare on Elm Street movies?
1160954	1161595	Yes, we do.
1161775	1162495	Yes, we do.
1162715	1168837	And we also need to inspire him to make a Scream 4 because I didn't think that those movies were going to be missed at all.
1168997	1173959	But now that they're gone and there's really not been a lot of good horror movies, I kind of miss them.
1174039	1174619	Exactly.
1174659	1179581	And what will Scary Movie parody on if they don't make any more Scream movies?
1181104	1181344	DarkSakura
1198388	1212416	I really have been trying to get stuff together because I'm starting school next week, so I didn't really get to play too much except for a little PSO and trying to get Ragnarok to install, but for some reason the Korean Ragnarok won't install on my computer.
1213396	1214277	Is it because it's Korean?
1215049	1216109	Possibly, honestly.
1216709	1220791	I think that they've upgraded on the newest build, so I need a really old build of it.
1221191	1226572	I seem to recall that the Korean, because I think you tried to get, no, who tried to get me to install this once?
1226952	1230894	Somebody was getting me to install the Korean one so that I could patch it to play on a free server.
1230914	1232874	It must have been LankyStyle, because he's all into that.
1233574	1238816	If you think Loki is a pirate, hang out with LankyStyle sometime.
1239726	1242667	Let's see the new Ragnarok Online.
1242727	1243848	It's so advanced.
1243948	1246189	It bans you before you even decide to play.
1246329	1246809	Stop it.
1247189	1251011	Anyway, I don't want to cut off DarkSakura, but I tried to install it once.
1251051	1251891	It was a pain in the ass.
1251951	1253152	I had to do all these special things.
1253172	1257254	It just can't initialize, so I need to figure out how to get past that.
1260175	1267758	Anyway, it's just really been... I can't find my Illustrator book, which means I might have to buy another one if I can't find it by Monday.
1268410	1269270	Like Adobe Illustrator?
1269390	1284754	Yeah, because one of my classes is Illustrator, the other one is Geography, and then halfway through the next semester I'm taking Dreamweaver and my other technical writing class with a teacher who says I have flawless writing.
1285014	1289195	Which means DarkSakura is going to be doing our site and all the graphics as soon as she graduates school.
1289935	1290715	Maybe before then.
1291255	1293516	Or the Orange Lounge site might start becoming homework for me.
1295574	1299536	Also, sort of a half plug for Pump Up the Volume.
1301077	1305480	In a couple weeks I'm going to be doing a demo for Dark Records.
1306220	1310382	They just went live this week and friends of mine are behind that.
1310822	1313004	And since I always try to play new music for everybody.
1313304	1315845	We can say the familiar DDR face that's behind a lot of this, right?
1316145	1322749	Well, my iguana girl is working with them, but they're people that, you know, I used to work with one of them.
1323616	1328240	I haven't, I think a lot of this has developed while I was kind of on vacation and tuned out of the world.
1328560	1329421	So what's going on?
1329501	1331843	They're making their own label type thing?
1332123	1336767	They're putting out the first record as a compilation of just different artists in the community.
1337288	1341491	So I'm going to be playing all that since I play new music on my show when I can.
1341771	1341992	Right.
1342032	1343713	And isn't it like synth pop, some of it?
1343853	1345374	Some synth pop, goth industrial.
1345535	1345755	Cool.
1346155	1349798	Pretty variant stuff across the angst-ridden level.
1349858	1352239	So possible Ultramix 4 music someday.
1353140	1353400	Maybe.
1353680	1354181	You never know.
1354281	1354661	You never know.
1354681	1355562	Well, that's kind of cool.
1356843	1357663	And all the rest of it.
1357703	1358624	We bought furniture today.
1360445	1364008	Dan bribed me with a bass guitar, which I'm not getting.
1364048	1367330	I'm actually going to pay a trainer instead.
1367690	1369772	How exactly do you get bribed with a bass guitar?
1370332	1372894	Because I like the furniture first because it's red suede.
1374266	1375527	But we ended up buying it anyway.
1375847	1379189	We got a big chaise lounge and a couch.
1379489	1382430	And we're going to get back and get end tables for it and everything.
1382750	1383351	It's comfy.
1383891	1384431	And suede.
1384691	1384872	Cool.
1384912	1386713	And the cat is not allowed anywhere near it.
1387413	1388373	And Shermie stopped peeking.
1388994	1389394	That's good.
1389434	1390875	What happened with your kitty?
1390915	1391355	Cat flew.
1391415	1392295	We think she had West Nile.
1394717	1395597	Someone I know had it.
1396197	1396558	Really?
1396798	1397058	Yes.
1397401	1398924	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1408982	1410462	Oh, I thought it was just Sacramento had the problem.
1410682	1411703	Oh, no, no.
1411803	1413763	One of my good friends lives in the D.C.
1413823	1414083	area.
1415523	1416363	She knew people who had it.
1416423	1419064	They're spraying out there, too, and the spray makes her sick.
1419144	1421064	I thought the spray was only happening out here.
1421084	1422384	No, this is all over the country.
1422404	1422885	Oh, dang.
1423345	1424085	Shows how much I know.
1424225	1426645	And typically in more humid areas, but still.
1427885	1429106	That would not be Sacramento.
1429246	1431486	Well, I know, but we also do have a floodplain.
1432526	1434627	And standing water does pool.
1435907	1436087	But...
1438642	1449650	Anyway, what I was trying to say about that is, I don't know if this is possible, maybe Shermie might have had some type of variant or something, because she would eat and then throw up and then cry pathetically.
1450050	1452492	You want to hear something really gross about what I got from a bug once?
1452792	1453033	What?
1453233	1457536	Okay, I once fell asleep on my couch, like out in the living room or something.
1457576	1458557	This was when I was living in Chico.
1458857	1461599	And I think I fell asleep with my mouth open.
1461619	1463440	You know how some people have their mouths open a little bit?
1463741	1466603	Well, I think a bug got in there and bit me on my gums.
1467130	1472574	because the next day my gum swelled up hella big and they were bleeding and stuff.
1472975	1475357	Imagine if you didn't brush your teeth for a year.
1476678	1478099	You're almost describing scurvy.
1479233	1480454	Maybe I caught scurvy.
1482255	1482956	And seed deficiency.
1483456	1483736	Wow.
1484717	1486838	And your teeth start falling out and your gums start to bleed.
1487058	1490521	No, my teeth didn't fall out and everything went away like three days later.
1490641	1492582	But it was really disgusting during the process.
1492782	1499426	And that was the only thing I could think of is that I must have been bitten by a bug because one part of it was slightly swollen, so I think it was a bug bite.
1499447	1500947	It was very similar to a mosquito bite.
1501228	1502248	That's icky poo.
1502789	1503829	Anyway, just thought I'd share.
1504590	1504950	Fun!
1505210	1506151	Enjoy that lovely image.
1506653	1507014	America.
1507915	1510177	Otherwise, it's just been busy.
1511559	1512641	Busy, busy, busy.
1513722	1514022	Sorry.
1514042	1514883	No, it's alright.
1515604	1516586	I've been sleepy all day.
1516606	1517487	I had coffee.
1517887	1518588	I didn't do anything.
1518969	1520270	I slept for 12 hours last night.
1521772	1522693	Mr. Jetlag.
1523735	1525577	Well, not just that, but the fact that
1526403	1529664	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1549827	1551828	I don't know, I could say my week has been okay.
1551868	1553829	Nelly's week has been kind of on the rocks.
1554289	1557010	First, she started off her week by having her car stolen.
1557330	1557910	That sucks.
1558611	1561172	And, yeah, so I've had to drive her around places and stuff.
1561712	1564973	And then she found a wedding dress yesterday, so that was kind of cool.
1566073	1573056	And otherwise, what I've been doing this week has been utilizing the internet for my advantage.
1573436	1574797	That's the best way to put it.
1575377	1601657	and because of that I have gotten to play so many damn games it's not even funny and um oh yesterday I went and bought a DVD burner because I had to upgrade my uh um pirating ability um to be able to burn DVDs that and just I need it for wedding stuff as well and then um so I had to install my CD burner into my mom's computer which I'm sure she'll be grateful for but she won't know how to use and um
1602654	1603274	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1624299	1628081	It's unlimited bandwidth, but it's like $14.95 a month.
1628441	1636065	And then the other server thing I'm on, which is basically a list, is $0.50 a month, I think.
1637285	1640647	And so I just basically signed up for that.
1640787	1642047	I'm going to try it out for a month.
1642328	1644549	If it's something I'm interested in, then yeah, I'll go for it.
1644589	1645389	Probably not, though, because
1645882	1648004	They don't have everything I'm looking for on there.
1649566	1652549	It's nice because I can download files really fast.
1652870	1660438	I love it, by the way, that you refuse to pay for anything, but you'll pay for the program to let you play.
1660871	1662152	All this software.
1662352	1668176	But if you think about it, though, because I've been trying to get... Speaking of which, I'm getting back into the music stuff.
1668216	1669377	I bought two sample CDs.
1669658	1671779	I bought one sample CD from BT, which is $100.
1671819	1677423	I bought another one, or I'm bidding on one that started off at $39.99.
1677583	1682627	I don't get you, because when you do spend money, you spend like $100 on a fucking CD.
1683127	1683648	Two CDs.
1684508	1685069	My bad.
1685189	1685689	My bad.
1685769	1686410	Two CDs.
1686750	1689532	Well, it's because I can't get it anywhere else.
1689712	1691153	It's no longer being made.
1691213	1692774	It's not on anywhere.
1692974	1699059	Trust me, I've looked at all the free angles for this first before I go and actually buy something like this.
1699299	1700780	They're just not selling it anymore.
1700880	1707144	So, I wanted to get it because BT is the fucking man when it comes to, you know, awesome breakbeats and that type of stuff.
1707224	1713569	And so, I have, like, one CD is basically all drum loops and stuff and the other one is all kind of like, you know, ambient sound kind of crap.
1714133	1715294	So I got those.
1715674	1716715	Well, I got the one at least.
1716735	1717675	I don't know about the other one.
1717695	1718576	I still have to wait on that.
1718736	1724659	And then just pretty much waiting for that stuff to come in and audio software stuff, which is worth over $2,000.
1726481	1728882	Anyways, but I'm merely trying it out.
1728982	1731183	I will delete it after 24 hours.
1731223	1731864	Yeah, sure you will.
1731884	1732444	Yeah, okay.
1732504	1735086	No, but honestly, what a load of crap is that, too?
1735366	1740329	Who said that that is a law, that you can download the program as long as you delete it within 24 hours?
1740369	1741510	Somebody made that shit up.
1741550	1741990	You know it.
1742789	1744050	I'm just trying to stuff out.
1745991	1747791	I've been having a lot of fun with my HD loader.
1748132	1748792	That's all I have to say.
1749272	1754835	I still think that you should tell all those people who say that using acid sucks to go bite your ass or something.
1754935	1757176	Well, that's why I'm going to create some good music with acid.
1758316	1760077	But I need the good samples because I'm lazy.
1760317	1761598	There was my point, though.
1763198	1764459	DJ Danger Mouse uses acid.
1764898	1765438	Absolutely.
1765939	1773924	For those that are kind of newer listeners to the show that don't know about the acid debate, Bomani Style once had a remix contest a while ago.
1773984	1775906	They have a remix contest going on now.
1775926	1778568	Well, they don't have anything going on now because their site's been down a couple days.
1779128	1780829	It was up this morning.
1781209	1781850	Maybe it's up again.
1781870	1782130	I don't know.
1782526	1788228	But anyway, they had a remix contest a while back and they said no mashups and nothing done in Acid type thing, right?
1788608	1791628	And so come to find out, like a bunch of popular DJs use Acid.
1791929	1797230	We got MidiHead on the show, asked him how he did his remixes for Ultramix 2 and he said Acid.
1798610	1800731	Now to be fair, he all seizes free loops.
1800751	1802491	He does, but... But who cares?
1802531	1803932	They're both the same damn program.
1803972	1806693	I mean, honestly, they're very similar.
1806833	1808293	So, who cares?
1809062	1811023	But yeah, so that's basically my week.
1811063	1814785	It's been a lot of downloading and a lot of Nelly yelling at me, Get out of your computer!
1814845	1816145	You know, that type of thing.
1816646	1819527	Question from chat, are you still relenting over Graffiti Kingdom?
1821048	1825810	I bought Graffiti Kingdom yesterday, but I haven't gotten a chance to play it yet.
1826930	1827250	Gotcha.
1827791	1828291	Just curious.
1829191	1834874	It was ironic because my PAL version of it finished downloading right when I bought it, so I was like, okay, fine, I'm just going to stick with this one.
1836014	1837175	Okay, that works.
1839048	1842131	Okay, well, me, my week and my day, gee.
1843372	1847575	Yesterday was a very interesting day because I left Philadelphia in the morning.
1848076	1850197	I stopped in Phoenix for a three-hour layover.
1850237	1854101	I ended up doing lunch with our webmaster, VxJasonXV, because I happen to be in Phoenix.
1854501	1855122	So that's just kind of neat.
1855402	1858164	I did lunch in Phoenix and then came home.
1858264	1859445	So it was an interesting day yesterday.
1860626	1865030	Of course, I've been doing a lot of work-related, and when I say work, I mean my actual day job.
1865768	1867109	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1888163	1889364	So what was I going to say along those lines?
1889484	1896731	Oh, so I have a real job, and my real job sent me away for two weeks because I had some stuff I had to do in the Philadelphia area.
1897712	1906280	So while I was out there, I ended up getting to go to a tournament in Jersey at 8 on the Break in Dunnellan, a little town there.
1906670	1907790	Thank you for watching!
1929915	1956740	Get kind of close to the machine when there's all those people in there Because the area, it's kind of like when they have tournaments at Sunnyvale Golf Land To put it in perspective for you guys Like there's aisles in between the machines They didn't really have, and that kind of surprised me Because I kind of thought, well they have this area with the pool tables Why don't they take the machine and move it into the back area Where there's all this extra room and move the pool tables around But for whatever reason they didn't do that So I got to see in the group too, but I didn't get to play it
1957160	1963204	And when I saw it, I was just kind of like, well, it's basically In The Groove 1 with different music and a red interface.
1963264	1967527	That's pretty much, I was like, okay, whatever, I don't really get the huge deal.
1967567	1974611	But in a way, that's also the exact same thing you could say about Max 2 versus Max, is that it was just, you know, more songs and a red interface.
1974911	1979194	So I'm not going to fault the game for that, but I can't really give you a full review of the game until I actually play it.
1979254	1981976	So I will withhold judgment of In The Groove 2 for a little while.
1982759	1983800	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2005379	2010463	And I was kind of like, I was kind of tired because I had a lot going on from the night before and stuff, just, you know, work and everything.
2010503	2013085	So I didn't really feel like being a social butterfly, so I was just kind of lurking.
2014506	2026215	And you know what I think is interesting about DDR tournaments on the East Coast, just like ones on the West Coast, is that, once again, there is that guy at the tournament who really needs to learn about showering regularly and using deodorant.
2026836	2031039	But you don't know who the offender is because there's so many sweaty guys packed in a room together.
2031820	2032680	And you're like, ah!
2033261	2033401	So...
2035015	2037057	That doesn't change, West Coast to East Coast.
2037117	2038498	Sorry, I don't know what to tell you guys.
2038518	2039058	That doesn't change.
2040459	2043001	But otherwise, in all seriousness, I stayed at the tournament.
2043081	2044221	It looked like it was okay.
2044301	2046163	It looked like it was being pretty efficiently managed.
2046503	2049145	But in all honesty, I didn't end up staying much more than 20 minutes.
2049485	2060052	Like I mentioned, since you didn't get a chance to play In the Groove 2 on the break, In the Groove 2 is actually at our local golf place, Paradise Island.
2060552	2061013	It just came in.
2061033	2061973	Did it officially get there?
2062013	2062634	Officially got there.
2062794	2063214	Interesting.
2063234	2064115	I might have to go check that out.
2065073	2069297	Actually, I have one more thing I forgot to say, speaking of tournaments and arcades.
2070357	2071919	Shaft 2 is happening.
2073760	2077523	I've got dates in mind, possible sponsorship from GameStop.
2079124	2081626	So in mid-November we're having Shaft 2.
2082447	2082727	Right on.
2084819	2087180	We'll definitely be a big sponsor of that tournament, of course.
2087280	2088721	We'll be whoring that tournament out.
2089961	2093202	And that will be sometime in November, is all we can say right now.
2093342	2096143	Yes, and working out of hopefully being able to broadcast live.
2097264	2101625	Basically, Shaft 2 is going to be a DDR tournament and a bowling league tournament.
2103466	2104346	How's that going to work?
2104366	2106447	Because there's no... I don't know.
2106857	2109039	Well, it is at a bowling alley, so there are bowling lanes.
2109320	2109420	Oh.
2109740	2109980	Yes.
2110201	2110481	Get it?
2110561	2111642	It's at Fireside Lanes.
2112043	2114585	Oh, I didn't realize it was at a bowling... Okay, well, that works.
2114705	2118449	I mean, obviously... I was like, how are they going to do bowling in, like, a golf place?
2118589	2128360	Yeah, actually, we were going to do the tournament at Roseville Golf Land, and we were going to tie ten children down and roll a giant ball at them like you used to see on, like... Roll a Katamari at them so that they stay stuck.
2129110	2140640	What was that old show they used to play on USA, which was like, you know, Extreme Games with the Stars, or whatever, where they had the giant bowling ball and they'd knock over all the people in the bowling pins?
2140921	2142242	That's what we were going to do with children.
2144143	2146025	No, it is actually going to be the legit bowling alley.
2146766	2148047	And what will it be, DDR Extreme?
2148808	2150049	Yes, it's on an extreme machine.
2150069	2150429	All right.
2151178	2153481	I'm working out details and I just got to get people together.
2154462	2159347	We should see if there's room to do some type of TV thing and bring in a home version of something.
2159627	2161910	I want to have like an amplitude tournament.
2163011	2163391	We'll see.
2163471	2164453	We'll see what works out.
2164833	2171120	But, you know, I'm not going to have much time to work on it at the end of the month because, of course, I'm doing that whole getting married thing, so...
2171974	2172875	MC Groove Dance Craze Miss Attack
2199761	2200842	What does Shaft stand for again?
2201823	2205125	Sactamani, which is sort of defunct, but eh.
2205905	2208747	Sactamani hosts another fabulous tournament.
2208767	2209868	Another fucking tournament.
2209888	2211409	You almost said another fucking tournament.
2211449	2212570	That's what it came from.
2212790	2215312	So it'll be Sacramento hosts another fucking tournament, basically.
2215492	2220596	But for the sake of the lovely management at Fireside Lanes, it's fabulous.
2221056	2221397	Oh, sorry.
2221997	2223298	And it's always fabulous.
2223838	2226480	How about frickin' or... Because it's got me in charge of the whole thing.
2226500	2228902	How about Sacramento hosts another Fireside Tournament?
2229457	2230998	because we haven't done one before.
2231899	2232719	That doesn't work.
2233160	2235662	Host an awesome fireside tournament.
2236122	2236342	All right.
2237323	2241366	I will see what I can do about buttering, because the chat room seems to be liking this idea of like an amplitude tournament.
2241666	2249332	So I will see what I can do about buttering up the one and only DarkSakura to let us do like not only an amplitude tournament, but some really horrible video game tournament.
2249392	2250993	I also may be coming into a copy of Rez.
2252294	2252694	Oh, cool.
2253195	2254215	So maybe Rez tournament.
2254436	2254816	Or something.
2254956	2256137	Can you really do a tournament on Rez?
2257487	2260349	I will be hosting an unofficial Meteos tournament, so bring your DS.
2260829	2261190	It's on.
2262410	2263491	Unofficial Meteos tournament.
2264431	2266653	Anyway, more details on that come November.
2269014	2272416	Actually, no, we won't give you the details in November, or else you won't have time to plan.
2272456	2274337	More details to come, like, soon.
2274577	2277899	And we would love for people to come from all over to support this.
2278019	2278559	Absolutely.
2278819	2279780	Later than now.
2280798	2281559	Yes, later than now.
2281859	2282099	Anyway.
2282199	2284240	People can crash in my playroom.
2284360	2285501	Back to the East Coast Tournament.
2285661	2288162	I didn't finish my story on the East Coast Tournament.
2288182	2288742	Why?
2288782	2289623	Actually, no, it's all right.
2289763	2290343	I cut you off.
2290363	2291004	You can cut me off.
2291044	2291404	It's fine.
2292544	2294145	It's because we love each other.
2295786	2297887	DarkSakura has this look of disgust on her face.
2298147	2298408	No.
2299008	2299668	No, that's okay.
2300929	2305771	I just saw Bush intent on change on my Yahoo, so I was like, that was the look of disgust.
2305791	2306532	You just saw Bush?
2306552	2306632	Yeah.
2307481	2308861	Bush intent on change.
2308961	2310622	Social Security turns 70.
2311522	2312082	Butthead!
2312742	2313002	Anyway.
2313843	2314443	He's not Bush.
2315103	2316103	Anyway.
2317584	2317944	Yeah.
2318844	2319084	Okay.
2320244	2321765	Sorry, I've been gone for a couple weeks.
2321825	2322445	Everything's funny.
2323665	2324305	Oh yeah, the tournament.
2324345	2326506	I only ended up staying at this tournament for like 20 minutes.
2326906	2327386	Because I just...
2329389	2340696	I wasn't competing, and I was just kind of watching and observing, and I didn't know who to root for, because I didn't know any of these people, and I felt really bad, but also I just had other stuff going on, so I just ended up leaving after like 20 minutes.
2341036	2344258	Except I left with one of our listeners, so that was a cool thing.
2344418	2346339	One of our listeners, Ranchan,
2346639	2347280	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2370783	2377327	And so, of course, we were all excited because we were going to play DDR on the IMAX TV, as I'm calling it, because it's a fucking huge TV.
2378267	2381629	And then, lo and behold, your PlayStation 2 wouldn't load anything.
2382010	2385912	We finally got DDR Extreme USA to work after a little bit, but...
2387930	2391391	No background movies and you had to wait like two minutes for the song to load.
2391672	2393272	That poor thing was busted.
2394013	2396914	I didn't even get a chance to play because the damn thing broke before, but it's alright.
2396954	2397375	I had fun.
2397655	2398956	I had fun just being around strangers.
2398976	2400456	I don't like to wear out my disk drive.
2400476	2401577	That's why I use my hard drive.
2404919	2411602	You know what I find ironic is all these people complain about their disk drive not working and it going off the thing.
2412303	2414544	I have a first model JPS2 that's never had a problem.
2417445	2430559	and on top of that the whole reason that the component cable didn't work when we were trying to play Katamari at my house was because we didn't have the visual settings set up for component oh yeah I found that out too the first time I tried to do component is that it wasn't set up right anyway
2430990	2439375	Anyway, so yeah, we were playing Extreme for a little bit, and then we just kind of just hung out, went to a diner and ate, and then left, went our separate ways.
2439395	2446879	And I went back to the tournament because I thought, okay, the tournament should be over by now, and I'll have a chance to play in the group too, so I can finally, you know, let Loki know how great it is.
2448744	2453568	And lo and behold, when I got back, the tournament was still going on, and it looked like it was still Perfect Attack.
2453869	2461855	I think actually what I missed in the morning, they were doing like an exhibition, they were setting up for freestyle, but I missed the actual competition itself.
2462136	2464658	And it still smelled like armpit when I got back.
2465659	2466239	Sorry to say.
2467200	2471063	But again, I'm not trying to pick on East Coast, because it's the same thing on the West Coast.
2471544	2473606	I'm not trying to make a Jersey reference.
2473646	2474046	Shut up!
2477708	2480829	Well, you know why they built the Statue of Liberty facing the way it does?
2481269	2482669	It's ass-facing New Jersey.
2483150	2488451	No, actually, everybody bashes on New Jersey, but I rather liked it in New Jersey.
2488611	2490352	I thought New Jersey was a nice place.
2490472	2500495	I like New Jersey because that's where Jay and Silent Bob and Kevin Smith and all... Well, I went to Red Bank my last trip to Jersey, so this time I just kind of hung out in Dunnell and a little while longer.
2501115	2502475	I actually kind of like Jersey.
2502535	2507437	I don't know why people knock on it, but from what I understand about Jersey, it's the big cities that suck.
2509290	2512614	and the other big cities in New Jersey that are no fun.
2512915	2514417	But I had a good time.
2515618	2516739	You know what else?
2516819	2521105	I actually went into New York City on Saturday and just walked around aimlessly for forever.
2521185	2522246	We just walked around
2522981	2524942	We walked around the Chelsea District, wink wink.
2525242	2529123	We walked around the area around Grand Central Station.
2529183	2530964	We walked around Union Square.
2531244	2532304	We walked around Times Square.
2532324	2533565	We just walked forever and ever.
2534305	2537506	Didn't get a chance to play any DDR in New York City, but I loved New York City.
2537526	2538347	I had a great time.
2538487	2540928	And I'm totally thinking like, I should just move here.
2543048	2543929	But I know I won't.
2543969	2546650	That's just the afterglow of a trip, you know.
2546850	2549991	I've been once and have not been inclined to go back for a long time.
2550271	2550951	This was 11 years ago.
2553581	2554922	The first time I went I was 17.
2555884	2557285	But everything was too organized.
2557486	2560450	It was nice to go back and not have a plan and get to walk around just like everywhere.
2560630	2561050	It was great.
2561311	2561932	I had a really good time.
2561972	2563153	I think I'd have a better time.
2563994	2566838	But honestly, I don't like looking up and seeing building.
2567719	2570423	I like looking up and seeing a tree and sky.
2570925	2573005	and breathing air that's not full of dirt.
2573305	2573886	It didn't bother me.
2574546	2575326	But this is the weird thing.
2575526	2578966	I hate San Francisco for that exact reason you're mentioning.
2579387	2580927	New York City, I loved.
2581267	2581907	I don't know why.
2582487	2584367	No, I do know why, actually.
2584387	2584948	It was the people.
2585168	2587808	There was a lot of just neat-looking people and neat-looking things.
2588588	2593069	I went to the Toys R Us in Times Square, which was awesome.
2593449	2594509	The Toys R Us in Times Square.
2594529	2596090	I've never been to such a cool-looking Toys R Us.
2596370	2597050	Did you eat at Roxy's?
2598564	2600245	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2617654	2618695	It was so cool.
2618715	2620376	They had demos for all these upcoming games.
2620396	2622058	It was almost like going to E3.
2622078	2624480	They had the Nintendogs demo, and they had a bunch of other demos.
2625181	2630325	I didn't realize the Nintendogs demo was everywhere at this point in a lot of stores, because I saw it at Best Buy the other day.
2630685	2634909	But I loved the setup there, and it was not an overpriced Toys R Us.
2634929	2641254	You would think that the Times Square would have overpriced games, but it was pretty much the same thing they'd charge in any mall or anything.
2641575	2642355	So I had a really good time.
2642495	2644157	I do want to go back and spend more time in the city.
2644837	2646900	Moving there, I think that's just kind of a joke.
2647161	2650486	I don't think I would actually... That would be highly unrealistic because it's expensive.
2650626	2651727	It's expensive to live there.
2652268	2652689	So we'll see.
2654712	2654952	Anyway...
2657396	2659558	So I guess that's about it.
2659958	2660379	You know what?
2660419	2660959	You know what's funny?
2661360	2666285	Somebody in our chat room, Sephiroth1215 actually said, brought up the Chinatown in the Groove 2 machine.
2666705	2671670	I found out about that after I left New York City because DJ Ranma S told me about it.
2671690	2673612	It was showing me pictures of the machine.
2674333	2675334	And I'm kind of sad.
2675394	2677716	I could have gone to Chinatown and actually played in the Groove 2.
2677996	2679638	But my friend who I was with,
2680063	2680703	Thank you for watching!
2695731	2696232	Caution, Dr. Dick
2713454	2715335	Yeah, I should just go in Dr. Dick Garb or something.
2715575	2719197	But seriously, this time I dressed, I just blended in, I was just another kid at the thing.
2719277	2721839	Although, really, I'm probably the oldest person that was there.
2722299	2732105	But, you know, I swear next time I go I'll... But I have some time off around the Labor Day, but there's too much going on around that time where I might not be able to go.
2732685	2733065	So we'll see.
2733846	2734106	We'll see.
2734403	2735824	Yeah, because someone you know is getting married.
2736104	2739427	I do, but I need to find out when the reception is because I can plan around it.
2740248	2741769	The next weekend.
2743511	2746833	Anyway, let's go to a break.
2747034	2752598	Now see everybody on the East Coast is telling me all these in the group 2 machines I could have gone to play.
2753039	2753639	Thanks guys.
2754300	2755941	This is good to find out about after the fact.
2756241	2757943	Now somebody's saying you should have gone to Coney Island.
2761721	2762602	Alright, let's go to a break.
2762642	2765985	In this break, we're going to hear some requests from the chat room.
2766645	2768747	And when we come back, we're going to talk about DDR with Fire.
2769308	2771770	And we're going to talk about some other things that have been going on in the DDR scene.
2772130	2774092	And we'll talk about whatever else we feel like talking about.
2774492	2775353	We'll be back after this.
2775613	2777094	We're going to start it off with a request.
2777154	2780337	We actually had a couple In The Groove song requests, so we'll get those out of the way.
2781098	2784260	Oh, this is good too because we want to hear about Loki's experience with In The Groove.
2784581	2785982	Because you teased something a while back.
2786002	2787063	What did you tease the listeners with?
2787083	2789505	That you were going to rent it or that you rented it but hadn't played it?
2790579	2792642	I have it, and I've played it.
2794143	2797928	And I was going to tell you my thoughts on it, and we're going to see if they've changed.
2798248	2799610	Okay, that's the first thing I've ever read.
2799630	2803234	Because it's very possible that they might have changed, and I could be an indie group lover.
2804035	2805997	And then again, angels could be real also, but...
2807057	2807618	You know what, though?
2808439	2812925	Now, you posted in your live journal something this week about an Apple product and that you liked it.
2813185	2814387	The G6 or something, right?
2814427	2814687	Wasn't it?
2814787	2815108	Or something?
2815468	2819974	Yeah, but did you... It was the Linux toaster.
2820074	2821316	It was the Linux toaster.
2821636	2822618	I was on dial-up.
2822658	2823559	I couldn't follow links.
2824540	2853958	So wait, but there was something Apple related, you confessed to liking a lot There was two, there was two things I posted in my live journal There's one that said this, the only viable use for an Apple iPod And it was a story about a woman bludgeoning her boyfriend Which was fake With an iPod, okay If you look it was on the rumor mill And then the second one was a picture of the Apple G6 And it was a Linux toaster Because we all know that the Apple has the processing power of a toaster I hate you
2856661	2857822	I was bored that day, okay?
2857982	2860024	We'll be back with Loki's thoughts on Indigree.
2860104	2863408	Honestly, I am sick and tired of this stupid Apple thing.
2863448	2865710	Okay, granted, we know that I don't like them.
2866291	2868994	Do we really need to constantly bring this up that I don't like them?
2869014	2870135	Because it gets old.
2870896	2871517	Nope, doesn't get old.
2871537	2871717	Okay.
2891590	2893131	Can you see me falling high?
2893211	2896734	Can you hear me calling you?
2897054	2903539	Shadows of it pass by You're ready to fade and die We'll love you Forever
2925727	2927188	Thank you for watching!
2957403	2958394	Can you see me?
3014592	3016613	The Beat Is Real Swift It's Groovin'
3042967	3046208	Maintain the game, the fame of what I see from Ramblin' Ramblin' down here
3090248	3090908	Thanks for watching!
3119247	3119808	Thanks for watching!
3146284	3148505	Thanks for watching!
3171690	3172370	Thanks for watching!
3197711	3211353	Oh, do it all night, do it with me I'll take you to heaven if you make me feel free, babe Do it tonight, do it all right Just take me and shake me till I burn up inside, oh
3226421	3227816	May, Haskell, Zaxxon, Salmon
3281886	3283167	Come on, do it with me.
3297639	3299541	We're back, boys and girls, here on Orange Launch Radio.
3299561	3304865	In that break, you heard some varying music there that was either inspired by chat or requested outright by chat.
3305525	3308688	Queen of Light there from In the Groove, A Minute from DDR Max 2.
3309088	3315333	And I know that Rini, who requested that song, actually wanted to hear the original, like, old-ass version.
3315353	3316174	It only takes a minute.
3316294	3317375	But I couldn't find it.
3317675	3323480	I could have sworn it was in that giant potpourri directory that I got from your computer, which I think in turn came from a Guana Girls computer.
3323860	3326282	I don't know why that would have been in there, since that's the original.
3327526	3327887	I don't know.
3328168	3330473	Wasn't there one in like way old-ass DDR?
3330914	3331074	No.
3331655	3332157	I thought there was.
3332277	3333339	The original was never in DDR.
3335429	3335890	I thought it was.
3335910	3337391	I thought it was in like an old-ass mix of DDR.
3337671	3338011	No, never.
3338551	3340432	Sorry, my memory's fading as I'm getting old.
3341133	3342634	Summer in Belize from In The Groove 2.
3342674	3344835	That was actually the first time I really listened to that song.
3345796	3346436	Not too shabby.
3346496	3346936	I like that one.
3346956	3347457	That was pretty cool.
3348077	3351879	Erotic from DDR3rd makes do it all night, because the chatroom was talking about Erotic.
3352199	3361205	Somebody actually asked what the Dr. Dick thing was all about, and even though I couldn't really play this song because it's a little bit longer, excuse me,
3362205	3371249	It was actually kind of inspired by an old erotic song called Help Me Dr. Dick, is where that monkey comes from, the Dr. Dick name.
3371669	3374710	And it's my improv freestyle alter ego.
3374730	3375850	Let me play a little clip of the song.
3381092	3385014	There we go.
3385034	3387095	So that's the song from Erotic, and that's where it came from.
3388035	3388235	Anyway.
3391089	3394530	Charum is swearing up and down that that was in third mix.
3394570	3396691	Let me check my DDR for a minute.
3396771	3400892	I could swear that... I thought I'd played the original one in DDR before.
3400912	3401752	It's just been so long.
3401852	3403253	I'm going to be honest, kids.
3403293	3404373	It's not really one of my favorite songs.
3404393	3404773	I'll just check.
3405093	3406473	Step Mania doesn't count.
3406553	3407354	I'll check my home version.
3407874	3408314	Holy crap.
3408374	3408634	Here it is.
3408674	3408834	Wait.
3408854	3409654	I have the third mix soundtrack.
3409674	3410034	You got it?
3410095	3410395	Here it is.
3413415	3413936	That's right.
3414216	3414696	That's right.
3415076	3415996	See, you have to hear it.
3416156	3418417	I have to think of the... I was thinking of the...
3420313	3421213	and a different one by them.
3424395	3427116	It's one of those ones I just never freaking played because I didn't like the song.
3427316	3428117	I love this song.
3428517	3429317	I didn't like it.
3429357	3429977	Sorry, kids.
3430638	3431878	It's one of those ones I always skipped.
3433659	3436020	Alright, so we fucked up.
3436080	3436580	Leave us alone.
3436860	3438341	We're allowed to make a mistake once in a while.
3439161	3441503	Alright, anyway, let's take a minute.
3441523	3444864	We're going to have Loki's review now of In the Groove.
3445224	3449166	Loki, you were mentioning that you... Did you rent or you bought In the Groove?
3451159	3452701	or you acquired in the groove?
3454783	3456464	Let me just say I played in the groove.
3456484	3457025	How about that?
3457065	3457845	We'll leave it at that.
3457965	3458306	Okay.
3458346	3466953	Because I consider it a waste of... I'm going to use it as a waste... Basically say it's a waste of space on my hard drive.
3467294	3467774	But anyways...
3468985	3476530	So yes, I played in the groove, I booted it up, tried it, you know, said, okay, what's the big deal about this game?
3476610	3479352	Played it for a good, you know, a good half an hour.
3479793	3481674	I definitely gave it a couple songs a try.
3483635	3485817	My opinion of this game has not changed one bit.
3486477	3487558	It still sucks ass.
3487678	3490120	And now I've played it, I can say it sucks ass.
3490580	3496745	You know, and I'm still debating on buying an actual copy of the game so I can write this game sucks ass so we can give it away, but...
3498112	3500435	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3515748	3517228	What kind of songs did you play when you played it?
3517569	3519709	Were there any catchy songs you liked at all?
3519989	3522590	I honestly, I can't even, they're forgettable.
3522650	3523970	That's how bad this game is.
3524430	3527711	I played a few things, I was just kind of going down the list.
3527891	3529852	And I don't remember what songs I played and when I played them.
3530352	3535274	But the step charts to me seemed like something I saw like on Bomani's style in their sim file section.
3535294	3537174	Like some idiot, just any idiot made them up.
3537574	3538594	They weren't that great.
3538835	3541355	I mean, and I was playing it on the most difficult settings.
3541415	3543896	So I was just, you know, okay, expecting something really cool.
3544913	3546335	No, I never got it.
3546615	3550399	And, okay, wow, there's so many modifiers, does nothing for me.
3550960	3554644	You know, that's just like saying, ooh, look, you know, cereal comes in multiple colors.
3554804	3555845	Doesn't matter to me, I mean.
3556165	3558528	Okay, to play devil's advocate here a little bit.
3558768	3559049	Okay.
3559109	3561211	What's so freaking great about DDR home releases, then?
3562771	3571778	The music, for one, all their music in the groove sounded like some just amateurish, very, very amateur sounding music.
3572739	3574681	Granted, the license stuff was okay.
3575041	3577183	I mean, it was okay, but it wasn't standout.
3577283	3579204	It was just, I mean, it's forgettable.
3579444	3580986	The entire game is forgettable.
3581126	3583047	That's pretty much what it comes down to.
3583688	3584809	I mean, you think that
3586161	3590805	I would be ranting and raving about this game, but even the Unlocked songs were just whoop-a-dee-doo.
3591005	3592206	I mean, it wasn't that great.
3592686	3595889	And I saw the preview songs for In the Groove 2 on there.
3596569	3596950	Wow!
3597750	3600733	I'm glad to see that they've sure not stepped up.
3601653	3609240	You know, it's interesting you didn't even like the Unlocked, because I would say probably my favorite In the Groove song with, I think, some of the most fun steps is one of the Unlocks, Anubis.
3609480	3614624	I know that song's horrid, sorry guys, but I think it's like the most fun...
3615843	3616604	Thanks for watching!
3634257	3638119	I've knocked on this game enough, let me see what it is, because maybe I could be wrong about it.
3638640	3640941	But I'm afraid I was not wrong about it.
3641021	3641942	It sucks.
3642622	3643663	It's a crappy game.
3644003	3645063	That's what it comes down to.
3645704	3646804	It's another music game.
3646924	3650026	Granted, if you're really starving for music games, go play it.
3650146	3653748	But I'm not starving for music games, so I'm not going to play it.
3654008	3655149	That's what it's going to come down to.
3655169	3656870	I just didn't like it.
3657932	3662255	To me, the whole game seemed like, you know, it seemed very, very amateur.
3662395	3669500	It seemed like just some guy made some homebrew stuff, got some company to publish it for him, and boom, there's the game.
3670180	3671441	Well, that's pretty much what happened anyway.
3671461	3673243	I was going to say, that's kind of what happened anyway.
3673723	3676485	But there's just not the polish in there.
3676705	3684050	It's just that, and even in the group too, there's not... You're not going to give them a break on the polish thing considering it's their first mix they've ever done.
3684130	3685831	Red Octane's first game they published.
3686192	3686712	Rockstar's
3687423	3687783	DarkSakura,
3709555	3716637	You know what, as much as I'm trying to play devil's advocate for In the Groove here because I do think the game's alright, the characters thing is kind of, yeah, lame.
3717438	3727461	But In the Groove 2 and In the Groove 1 really feels to me, just from Observer, remember I haven't played the game yet so I'm not going to give a full review on the game until I actually play it.
3727861	3732363	But from a glance, from looking at it, it doesn't look any different from Max 2 to Max 1.
3732523	3735244	And let's not forget Max 2 was actually a real improvement over Max 1.
3735684	3736224	But what did they do?
3736244	3737264	They changed the interface to Reb.
3737425	3738005	Whoopee shit!
3738045	3738765	And added some songs.
3739025	3742766	But the game itself was... Well, they also added non-stops and stuff, I think.
3742967	3743507	Or Oni.
3743627	3745688	Was it Oni and... Marathons and In the Groove?
3746148	3747068	Well, they had that on the next show.
3747088	3747668	I don't know.
3748229	3748709	Whatever.
3748789	3750589	But still, though, I mean, come on now.
3751050	3752630	It's... I don't know.
3753010	3754951	I even... It's just, it wasn't for me.
3756552	3761274	Alright, boys and girls, if you disagree with Loki, we will give you a chance to... Well, you know, so what?
3761314	3762534	You disagree, big deal.
3762574	3764055	I mean, I gave it a shot.
3764115	3766075	It wasn't like, you know, I'm talking about nothing here.
3766215	3767556	I actually played the game, so...
3768904	3769664	What are you going to say?
3769865	3770965	Oh, so you don't like it.
3771005	3771505	You're wrong.
3771605	3773286	No, actually, it's my opinion, so I'm right.
3775146	3777467	It's just, you know, it's just not a very good game.
3777487	3779748	You know, whatever.
3779888	3782169	I mean, I don't like Pump It Up either that much.
3782649	3787571	Granted, that game is better than In The Groove because they've put more polish into the game.
3787611	3789792	Granted, I think the crazy mode is retarded, but
3790202	3795004	You know, the dance sequences are fun, and the music is okay.
3795084	3795604	It's different.
3796544	3801546	And, I don't know, the background movies are actually good, whereas In the Groove is kind of plain.
3801946	3808009	But, you know, I will actually go on the record saying, and keep in mind I haven't played many Pump It Up games in the arcade.
3808049	3809929	I've played a various amount.
3810810	3812410	I actually think In the Groove is better than Pump It Up.
3814071	3817112	I hate Pump It Up's interface with a passion.
3817953	3818474	I hate it.
3818614	3820275	It ruins almost the whole damn game for me.
3820295	3821916	And to be honest, the music is kind of hit and miss.
3822096	3826620	There's some great songs in Pump It Up, but a few more misses than hits for me.
3827221	3828301	I can't play the same six songs.
3828341	3828662	I don't know.
3828682	3831604	I can play In The Groove a little bit longer, I guess, to see if my opinion changes.
3831624	3832605	Your opinion won't change.
3834847	3837729	Maybe In The Groove 2 is this godly game.
3837829	3839190	Now maybe In The Groove 2 is a little better.
3839210	3839550	You'll see.
3839771	3840091	We'll see.
3841312	3842052	I don't think so.
3843153	3846416	That's like saying maybe McDonald's brand new stuff tastes good.
3847054	3848475	Maybe it's going to be real meat this time.
3849055	3849216	No.
3850957	3855440	Alright, well, chat room, if you want to respond to that, we will open up the Skype line a little later.
3857121	3859922	There's not going to be anything you're going to say that's going to change Loki's mind.
3859942	3862044	I do have something, though, that we've got to try.
3862204	3864025	I meant to get here earlier today.
3865786	3868088	I have acquired a copy of SingStar.
3868828	3869509	What the hell is that?
3869789	3871510	The European karaoke game.
3872042	3873983	SingStar Popstar
3901607	3905350	Yeah, ThinkStarPop is... Okay, so maybe they altered the name a little bit.
3905450	3907171	Okay, so you got a chance to check this out.
3907371	3911634	Well, I haven't got to play it yet, but I meant to bring it over today.
3912675	3914657	Well, we'll have to check it out next week.
3914677	3916478	Just like you were going to bring Taiko no Tachigen for PS3.
3917360	3918521	I was running out the door, literally.
3918541	3919661	I was like, what time is it?
3919741	3920542	Ah, shit, I'm going to be late.
3920822	3921442	Alright, alright.
3932988	3938991	It's actually something that the creators of the game, or I think it was the distributors of the game, actually emailed us about a while back.
3939351	3942953	And we've kind of refrained from talking about it because there has been a lot of information on it.
3943894	3945174	But I actually got a chance to play this game.
3945214	3950157	And imagine if Taiko no Tachigen and Drum Mania had a baby.
3951057	3955760	It would be this game called Percussion Master, which is what I got a chance to play over at 8 on the Break.
3957265	3959607	I actually kind of enjoyed Percussion Master.
3959667	3968495	When I first was kind of looking at the release that the guy had sent us and stuff, and the fact that there wasn't a whole lot of information, I was kind of thinking, eh, I don't know about this game.
3968595	3970757	It kind of looks like it's going to be a little cheese bit of a ripoff.
3971078	3974561	But what makes this game good is that they actually have a pretty solid song list.
3974861	3979783	Now, granted, they have a lot of covers in it, but that's okay, because Karaoke Revolution has covers too, and they work out really well.
3980463	3990027	Percussion Master has covers of songs like Goonies Are Good Enough, Mickey, I think there was a Britney Spears song I had to play in there too, and then just some other classics as well.
3990307	3991348	I don't remember the whole list.
3991388	3993029	I'm sure there's a song list out there on the internet somewhere.
3993289	3994809	But it had a pretty solid song list.
3994849	3995690	I was pretty impressed.
3997236	3998177	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4016154	4018995	So you're beating on a pie and two loaves of bread.
4020116	4022636	But it feels a lot like Taiko, for some reason, when you play.
4022676	4030579	Because it's like, instead of hitting the side of the drum, you're hitting these little things on the top, where normally it would be a very similar striking motion as I would hit the side of the drum.
4030859	4033240	So that's why I think I kind of call it very similar to Taiko.
4033500	4037181	But the interface is very much like Drum Mania, where the notes scroll from the top.
4037681	4039122	And it was pretty cool.
4039542	4039962	The only...
4041098	4050083	I guess negative thing I would be able to say about Percussion Master is that it doesn't seem like there's a whole lot you can do with the game.
4050984	4061190	And granted, maybe you could say the same thing about Drum Mania, but it kind of seems like, I don't know, with these three drums, and maybe I didn't play songs that were hard enough, but it kind of seemed like, I think this game might get boring after a while.
4062156	4062697	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4081994	4083155	We sure are no directions.
4083255	4084297	That game is just crazy.
4084337	4086839	You sort of have to guess as you go along.
4087460	4090042	They have one in Santa Cruz on the boardwalk.
4090303	4091384	Yeah, it's like, huh?
4091744	4094787	I think it's distributed by the same people that do the Drumscape game.
4094807	4097430	Because I remember on their site, I thought I saw something about Drumscape.
4097730	4099932	But this is not, I didn't see any ties to MTV.
4100193	4105238	You know what was really kind of funky about this game is that on their high score list, it actually had pictures of the high score people.
4105518	4110860	because the game actually has a little teeny camera in it that takes your picture, like an eye toy type thing, that takes your picture when you get a high score.
4111200	4112380	Now, I didn't get any high scores.
4112700	4118702	Go figure, I freaking triple-A'd two of my songs the first time I ever played them.
4118722	4120523	They're not really triple-As, but whatever you want to call them.
4120543	4124944	I got all perfects the first time I played these songs, and I didn't get my picture on the high scoreboard.
4125324	4128365	I guess my scores weren't good enough, somehow, even though I got all perfects.
4129145	4129385	Oh well.
4130066	4131146	Somebody beat me to it, I don't know.
4134380	4136681	Yeah, to answer the question in the chat, is this the MTV licensed game?
4137061	4140463	I didn't see an MTV logo on this game anywhere, so I don't think it's MTV.
4140583	4146785	And there was nothing like Carson Daly wasn't in it, so I don't think there was anything to do with MTV.
4147805	4149366	Oh, he's not affiliated with MTV anymore, is he?
4149506	4150126	I don't think so.
4150647	4151387	I think he's gone.
4151687	4153268	He works for NBC now, that's right.
4154068	4154968	He has a show on NBC.
4155268	4156029	Why are we talking about that?
4156109	4156329	Anyway.
4157469	4159370	That's way too much time for him already.
4159570	4159710	Yeah.
4161198	4169682	So, I got to play the game, I liked it, I just don't think I could play it every day, but it's a nice, like, it's something that I think I'd have fun playing in between games of DDR.
4171463	4182067	Now, Taiko no Dachshund for the PSP, it's awesome, it's great, and you were wondering, I'd be like, looking at the game, I'm like, how the hell is this going to work?
4182187	4188050	Because, I mean, you can't obviously beat the PlayStation with... I was going to say, how can...
4188895	4198825	When I think of Taiko Nutachijin on PSP, I think about Beatmania on the Game Boy, or on the Wonderswan even, and I kind of like... Beatmania on the Wonderswan was great!
4199205	4200226	It was digitized.
4200847	4206953	Yeah, it was, but, I mean, playing with the buttons and the control pad... Nah, the play was missing for me.
4206973	4207914	It works very simple.
4208174	4210757	Basically, on the Taiko drum, your main...
4212770	4221095	The directional pad and the right drum would be the four buttons.
4221475	4224177	And then the sides are the L button and the R button.
4225218	4226599	And so that's how the game's played.
4226759	4228680	And it's really simple, easy to figure out.
4229080	4231302	The minigames are fucking hilarious.
4231462	4232182	They're great.
4232682	4233803	And they get really hard.
4234223	4235084	And it's a lot of fun.
4236925	4239006	I'd highly recommend the game when it comes out here.
4239127	4240567	It's right now only in Japan.
4240848	4241328	But, um,
4242250	4242870	It looks really good.
4242930	4246992	It's a good start for music games, though, on the PSP, because it's done very, very well.
4249112	4249792	Can't wait to play it.
4249872	4251673	It has Toxic on it, which I thought was weird.
4251993	4254234	Toxic, and there was a couple other songs that were really strange.
4254274	4256555	Is this a Japanese version of Taiko, or is this American?
4256575	4257475	Yeah, this is Japanese.
4257495	4258255	And they had Toxic?
4258655	4261036	I don't remember that being on any of their... They had Toxic on there.
4261096	4262276	They have We Will Rock You.
4262636	4266017	They also have, of course, you know, Katamari on the Rocks.
4266037	4267198	Of course.
4267278	4270239	And just some other weird songs on there, Ridge Racer and stuff, and...
4271178	4271618	It was fun.
4271658	4272898	They have all the sounds you can unlock.
4274059	4276179	It sounds very similar to the U.S.
4276459	4279200	release, Taiko Drum Master, but on the PSP in Japanese.
4279620	4283641	Like the songs you're saying, I'm thinking, yeah, that wasn't Taiko Drum Master.
4285181	4286661	I couldn't tell you, but it's fun.
4287161	4287481	I like it.
4287801	4288141	Interesting.
4289882	4292742	Wow, we've played a whole lot of new music-based games these past couple weeks.
4292942	4294503	DarkSakura, did you play any new music games?
4296023	4296203	No.
4297623	4298003	Sorry to hear it.
4298624	4300044	I told you, I've been getting ready for school.
4300304	4300924	All right, all right.
4302779	4304000	I've been playing Burnout 3.
4304040	4306242	That's not really a music-based game, but it's fun.
4307863	4308583	I'll talk about some.
4308603	4311025	I've been playing Illuminus, which is kind of like half a music game.
4311365	4316309	I have all three copies of my puppies on order.
4317030	4321193	Ooh, ooh, I didn't know that Technic Beat was coming out on PSP.
4323454	4324075	That's awesome.
4324591	4325472	What was Technic Beat again?
4325492	4331437	Technic Beat was that one with the little dude that walked around with all the circles and you'd have to walk to the circle and hit the button.
4331677	4336041	Yeah, and as a reminder also that DJ Maxx is coming out on the PSP.
4336802	4337622	That one's going to be weird though.
4337642	4342026	That's going to be playing just like, I think, Beatmania on the PSP.
4342086	4343347	It's going to be a little weird.
4343607	4344088	Interesting.
4344748	4345169	But cool.
4345429	4346510	I'm still very excited about it.
4348211	4351254	Alrighty, I think what we're going to do now is we're going to go ahead and take a break.
4351594	4360561	And when we come back from this break, we're going to do a little bit of Skype and hear what the callers have to say.
4361582	4362643	So we'll do that.
4364004	4366246	First off, though, I want to see if I can find this.
4366386	4372311	I wanted to play some songs from the new... If I could find it.
4372351	4373052	Maybe I don't have it.
4373973	4375594	I don't want to say what it was if I don't really have it.
4378792	4380052	Nevermind, I'll have to look for that for later.
4380193	4384794	And also, we'd like to thank our listeners who voted for us for the podcast awards.
4385074	4385534	Absolutely.
4386595	4387835	Thank you.
4387915	4388435	That's right.
4388936	4389456	Looking at us.
4389596	4389936	Thank you.
4391416	4394278	And also, did you know that this week we're featured on the iTunes store?
4394398	4394738	I saw that.
4394778	4395398	We're on page two.
4395458	4396178	Isn't that crazy?
4396438	4396558	Yeah.
4396958	4398459	I don't know how that happened, but we're there.
4398899	4399619	That's pretty awesome.
4399759	4400520	I'm not going to complain.
4400980	4401220	Hell no.
4403801	4407563	Oh, and I have to apologize for last week, or not really last week.
4407623	4410045	All you had was a headset microphone, first of all.
4410085	4419890	But the week before last, with Katamari Radio, that we were pretty much doing, because we had We Love Katamari at DarkSakura's house.
4419910	4422811	Oh, I was going to play music from We Heart Katamari.
4422831	4425452	50-inch widescreen Katamari.
4426713	4427954	That game is so much fun.
4428194	4428594	I love it.
4429456	4432339	The Namco X Capcom intro looked very cool on my TV.
4432359	4437442	Yeah, I'm going to probably delete that game just because I don't know how to play it and it's all in Japanese.
4438543	4440385	Actually, don't delete it yet because I want it.
4442947	4444908	You need to show me where to get that thing you have.
4447961	4450342	Alright, we're going to go to a break and we're going to come back and have the Skype line.
4450382	4451322	We'll be back after this.
4451722	4453402	Also, DDR with Fire when we come back.
4454783	4457463	We'll do some Bomani Potpourri in this break.
4457503	4459404	We'll start off with a little bit of Taku.
4459864	4462064	Maybe this will perk DarkSakura up, a little bit of Taku.
4462845	4463085	Yay!
4463105	4463805	Alright, here we go.
4463865	4464525	We'll be back after this.
4572954	4577558	Can you keep me like a nasty girl?
4577598	4578959	You want a nasty love?
4579079	4588807	I know that you want it, honey Feeling so much fear for messy hot tea for love You know that I want it
4605743	4618027	I'm just asking for the real love It's gonna make me feel Take me higher And I'm not proud enough So try to make sure that you feel And I'm proud enough So try to make sure that you feel

4908703	4910804	Oha Max Survivor would have been the best thing ever.
4911264	4911524	No.
4912664	4915766	The new Dancing Stage is actually Dancing Stage Max.
4917646	4918167	I'm serious.
4918507	4919167	I know, I know.
4919207	4920048	This is stupid.
4920448	4923249	Anyway, they're like, we couldn't think of a better name, so Max.
4923959	4931863	In that break, Taku with Electro-Tuned, not only 2DX 3rd style, I think it was originally in, DDR 5th Mix as well.
4931963	4936365	Risky Men featuring Asuka with Mr. T, Take Me Higher.
4937566	4938186	Asuka, sorry.
4938946	4942628	What, 2DX 4th style as well as... Wasn't it in one of the DDRs?
4942768	4943769	5th Mix, DDR, I think?
4944669	4945850	I think it was one of those unlocks.
4945890	4947330	Remember how... It was in 5th Mix.
4947350	4949151	Yeah, remember how 5th Mix had all those unlocks in it?
4949531	4951052	I think Electro-Tuned was also one of those songs.
4951392	4952733	Yeah, Electro-Tuned was in 5th Mix.
4953434	4954535	Cherry with Yesterday.
4955196	4959319	Boy, we played a lot of songs that crossed over in other Bomani games that break without even realizing it.
4959619	4962582	Cherry, Yesterday was, was that actually in Parapara?
4962782	4963482	It was in Parapara.
4963662	4964163	Yes, it was.
4964203	4964463	Was it?
4964683	4969227	It started off with the right arm sweep, left arm sweep, both arm.
4969487	4970568	That scares me that you remember that.
4970919	4972380	Yeah, that's like all I remember of it, too.
4973061	4974182	In 2DX 6-Style, of course.
4974422	4978646	There was a Para song in 6-Style that wasn't actually in Para Para Paradise.
4978706	4980748	I think it's the song, Para Para Paradise.
4980768	4981108	That's it.
4981148	4982029	That's why I'm getting confused.
4982389	4983430	You remember that song in 6-Style?
4983591	4984852	Para Para Paradise.
4984912	4985752	That song wasn't in.
4986073	4987334	That song was a pain in the ass.
4987954	4994861	Anyway, also, a Konami original there, the Metal Gear Solid mix from Beatmania.
4995461	4997343	Hell, that wasn't the very first Beatmania, wasn't it?
4998733	4999694	Beatmania 3rd Mix 3rd Mix
5020933	5025499	Well, first and second were released as one, with the append.
5025659	5026480	Oh, that's right, that's right.
5026620	5027161	The Ebisu.
5028302	5033448	And then there was third, fourth, because... And they were all appends, weren't they?
5033689	5034449	Yes, fifth.
5034530	5035551	Until they got to sixth.
5036690	5039272	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5059011	5059952	Exactly, exactly.
5060172	5061833	Nintendo can get away with that shit.
5062093	5065034	Yeah, we're going to release three different versions of Nintendogs, and you're going to buy them all.
5065655	5068316	Um, but yet... Okay, Nintendo, we love you, bye-bye.
5068376	5068896	Exactly.
5069216	5071878	Okay, Nintendo, just put out another Zelda game, and we'll be fine.
5074719	5074979	Anyway.
5076160	5077801	That's how they get you started.
5078181	5081663	I got told, um, Electro-Tuned was actually in second style.
5082512	5083073	So I forgot.
5083493	5083873	I forgot.
5083954	5084294	You know why?
5084314	5088138	Because I'm used to playing it in third style PS2.
5088258	5088779	Give me a break.
5090280	5090721	No, that's all cool.
5093837	5094237	Let's see.
5094397	5096439	Oh, also I wanted to say about the Metal Gear Solid theme.
5096459	5102002	It's also going to be in the upcoming Beatmania USA, at least if the E3 demo is any indication.
5102262	5107706	That's a game we really haven't heard anything about for quite some time, but it kind of makes sense because, you know, we've got two DDRs looming.
5107726	5113069	I'm assuming that Konami staff is kind of busy with those games and they'll worry about Beatmania when those two are out.
5114150	5117452	I think there was a date change or something about it.
5117952	5119493	It's still in spring.
5119793	5121974	I think Miklatov is back on the show next week.
5122074	5123916	I do think he's planning a trip up here next week.
5123956	5132501	So although he's been very tight on his NDA this year and hasn't been able to give as much juicy gossip on the show, hopefully we'll be able to get something out of him next week.
5132661	5133281	At least something.
5134062	5139545	And also the heads of a bunch of game companies are coming to my work at the end of August.
5140065	5142627	So I'm going to get this smooth with the head of Konami.
5143247	5145128	Take those Orange Ones Radio press kits.
5145228	5146489	I will be taking the press kits.
5146509	5149290	Hopefully we haven't bashed too many of their products.
5149310	5158354	We're going to have the head of, what was it, they're going to be, I think Microsoft is coming, Ubisoft, Konami.
5158574	5161816	Well, there's about 25 invites at least that they're going out to.
5161876	5168159	Now, tell that Konami dude that they need to release a freaking press release on Xtreme 2 already.
5168239	5169319	No, I know you're not really going to do that.
5170720	5172662	Expect a small wave of information in the near future.
5172682	5173042	Ultramix 3 info
5189798	5191319	Yes, there was more Ultramix 3 info.
5191339	5192339	I'm glad you brought that up.
5193099	5196380	That was also a DDR Freak forum thing.
5196780	5214887	One of the users on there, who I know I've seen their name before as a show listener, so hello guy if you're listening, that was actually Same who sent the email to Zonk's official website asking if they have songs in DDR Ultramix 3 and to come back, yes, DDR Ultramix 3 will feature a song by Zonk and a remix by Zonk.
5215827	5215967	Hmm.
5217395	5219197	I forgot what I was going to say.
5219457	5223962	I looked back, I had to dive back in the archives in my live journal back in the day.
5223982	5229568	I remember when I found there was a whole unprotected section of Zonk's website that had a bunch of info.
5229769	5232772	They had a bunch of graphics and stuff that were used in the song.
5233753	5235034	They don't have that anymore.
5236616	5237237	Apparently...
5237867	5247690	DDRFreak managed to dig up this post that said the forbidden dance dance Basile from the Or If Is release will be in Ultramix 3.
5249403	5250264	It's a weird song.
5250504	5254407	Orifice was the folks that did Art of Hot, also.
5255127	5258209	Orifice is just one of the guys from Zonk, also, if you didn't know that.
5258290	5259751	Orifice and Zonk are kind of related.
5260211	5261372	Orifice is just one of the guys from Zonk.
5261632	5264234	And I think their song, Art of Hot, I think was the name of it?
5264274	5265435	Or was that another group?
5266335	5266776	I can't remember.
5266816	5272420	It's one of those songs, I have to admit, I love the Zonk song in Ultramix 2, but I don't really play the Orifice song very much.
5272880	5273340	Sorry to say.
5274321	5275182	I wasn't a big fan of that.
5276603	5276723	Yep.
5278815	5281457	So it's very interesting how many folks are coming back.
5283258	5283879	Oh, I screwed up.
5283919	5285280	The name of the song is I Spy.
5285760	5286421	I found a clip of it.
5286461	5286781	Here it is.
5286901	5287762	Art of Hot was another band.
5288682	5289603	That's the Orifice one.
5293046	5295167	And you can kind of see the similarities there to Zonk.
5296978	5299939	Anyway.
5300839	5305281	Rene posted us a link in the chat room on Konami's official website.
5305321	5307621	They're still saying Spring 2006 for Beatmania.
5308162	5309402	There's an official little link there.
5309422	5310602	Yeah, I think it's still Spring.
5311783	5312303	I'll ask him.
5313063	5313463	I'll bug him.
5313983	5317524	Because what's great about, you know, it's just... I don't know.
5318065	5319045	I know the most about games.
5320085	5321646	It's just what it comes down to.
5322126	5322346	Just...
5322853	5328079	Find out already if Cartoon Heroes is going to be an Extreme 2 or not so we can shut these people on DDR Freak up.
5328580	5329040	Okay.
5329761	5330041	Alright.
5331042	5334166	Anyway, I guess we should open up the Skype line.
5335307	5336268	See if we can get some calls.
5336669	5337510	We've had people asking.
5338190	5338471	Alright.
5339872	5341234	Well, I'm firing up Skype right now.
5341707	5342328	Logging in.
5342368	5342888	Beep, beep, beep.
5342908	5343329	Here we go.
5343849	5345951	I should see if there's been any upgrades to Skype recently.
5346252	5349895	You know you should check Skype's website often because they do fix their program quite often.
5349915	5351257	They always release new ones.
5351817	5355501	Did you know, by the way, we have like 61 people on our list on Skype?
5355541	5356342	I think that's kind of cool.
5357102	5359765	Okay, so I just logged on to Skype and there's only like five people in.
5360005	5360526	What's up with that?
5362065	5363085	Well, we're up and running.
5363145	5365946	We're ready for you guys to start calling in if you want to call us.
5366966	5373128	Remember, if you want more information on how to call the program, www.orangeloungeradio.com.
5373448	5378089	Click on Interact With Us, and it has more information about the Skype line.
5378129	5379969	And I just dropped my mouse, which is really smooth.
5380029	5380649	Yes, DarkSakura?
5381550	5382610	That's what I'm saying I'm about.
5383250	5385050	Oh, me dropping my mouse, yeah.
5385671	5386671	Oh, look, we got a call.
5386731	5387311	Let's take it.
5387391	5389611	Oh, this is a guy that used to call us like all the freaking time.
5389631	5390592	We haven't talked to him in a while.
5391192	5391672	Let's do this.
5392611	5393752	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
5395053	5395973	Legend of Zaku here.
5396193	5397734	Hello, Legend of Zaku.
5397774	5398715	Long time no chat.
5399515	5399976	I know.
5400116	5402057	I finally got broadband, so now I can do this.
5402377	5404959	And I'm in the middle of a storm, so I'm going to try to make this real quick.
5405299	5405599	Alright.
5405619	5407140	Congratulations on the broadband upgrade.
5408281	5408801	Yeah, man.
5408881	5413004	Anyways, I could vouch for you for the whole In the Group 2 thing.
5413524	5413904	How so?
5413964	5418287	Because I've been already playing this game since, what, July?
5419388	5419848	Last month?
5419868	5419948	Yeah.
5420999	5424926	That's all I've been doing, playing in the groove in Coney Island and Chinatown.
5424986	5428172	So I can pretty much say it's a big improvement from the first one.
5428913	5429254	Really?
5429354	5431558	I don't know if that's really vouching for me, but okay.
5431838	5433862	Item by item, can you name how it's better?
5435290	5446874	Let me see, Freeze Rules, the fact that, you know, it's just a, you know, with the new cabinet and the fact that the pads aren't as, you know, aren't as just crappy as, you know, as if you were actually putting it in a DDR machine.
5447174	5448054	Let me state this, too.
5448134	5459357	Maybe I should have gotten this out because, and this is one thing where I may have said that In the Groove 2 looks exactly like In the Groove 1, because the machine it ate on the break is an upgraded old cabinet, you know, like a DDR cabinet from back in the day.
5459958	5460098	So...
5461559	5462560	Two in the group's credit.
5462600	5464400	That might be part of the reason why I'm feeling that way.
5464500	5465361	I didn't see a new build.
5465941	5469543	Most of the in the group two machines are brand new in the city.
5470703	5471604	Well, I missed them.
5472024	5473905	Zaku, you should have called me while I was out there.
5474663	5479386	I was getting my broadband set up last week, so add to that.
5480086	5480967	I may be coming back.
5481067	5482288	I may be coming back very soon.
5482708	5483629	Are you sure about it?
5484249	5489152	You know Digital Life Expo is happening in October.
5489272	5491173	I know, but I don't know if I can swing the time off work.
5492454	5493475	I mean, it's worth it.
5493815	5494415	Think about it.
5494995	5499738	What would persuade you to actually go there and bring the rest of the people so that way you can broadcast it live?
5499818	5500859	It's not about persuading me.
5500899	5503881	It's about persuading my boss, and I'm sure Loki and DarkSakura feel similar.
5504855	5505176	DarkSakura.com
5514858	5519802	Me, personally, I would love to come out there if I can get the time off, which I don't know if it's very likely.
5520162	5522104	I did see the advertisement about the tournament.
5522444	5523145	It's tempting.
5523525	5525867	I think I'd know more people in an NYC tournament.
5525907	5529510	Hopefully I should be competing there this year again, like I did last.
5529790	5530791	Let me put it this way, Zaku.
5530811	5531692	I'm not saying no yet.
5532152	5534094	I am considering the idea.
5534174	5535214	Oh, one more thing.
5535415	5539238	As you already know, we New Yorkers already have an unlocked 2DX11 Red kit.
5540719	5542721	Yes, I've already played 2DX11 Red.
5542761	5544322	Where did a 2DX Red go in New York?
5545730	5547552	This place called Tri-County Fair in Long Island.
5549074	5549434	Oh, okay.
5549814	5551476	See, I didn't get a chance to go to Coney Island at all.
5551496	5553838	I mean, there's a lot in New York City, as you know.
5554639	5556300	So I didn't get a chance to really do everything.
5556320	5557081	That's why I want to go back.
5557902	5562866	It's an unlocked machine, so we pretty much have all the other unlocks, you know, since the kit is straight from Japan.
5563507	5564007	It's used.
5564368	5571094	You know, I had heard something about an In The Groove 2 machine that opened up somewhere in Michigan.
5571114	5571194	Yeah.
5571658	5590411	and it already had everything unlocked and all these people saw all these new songs they weren't supposed to and then the next day the lock was back on and all the songs were gone and they didn't realize anyway, I don't know I don't know why I thought to mention that I just kind of remembered that right now because I was hearing this story just like yesterday so anyway, I'm just throwing that out there
5593177	5596418	Yeah, man, that's what's been going on in New York so far.
5596558	5602480	So this Digital Life tournament that's coming up, is this the one where they're giving away, like, thousands of dollars or something for the freestyle?
5602540	5607342	Yes, two grand is a grand prize for most, if not all, the events in the first place.
5607442	5615085	So I know, now, is Digital Life the same one that Frequency went to last year, and we interviewed him after that, and he had had the run-in with, like...
5615625	5619506	Much music and stuff.
5619806	5627107	Yeah, I basically told him about how you wanted to interview him and all that.
5627227	5628887	Yeah, I remember that.
5629448	5632968	So yeah, I would love to go to that event if I can make it work.
5633008	5634749	I don't know if I can, but I will try.
5635469	5637309	See what you can do, man.
5637349	5639389	We would love to have you out there.
5639769	5642290	That would be good promotion-wise for Orange Lounge.
5643220	5645902	Freestyle Twin, I'm going to be entering freestyle, like I did last year
5669216	5681044	I think I'm planning on doing Swing It from Fifth Mix, trying to dress up like Pee Wee Herman with the platform shoes, red bow tie, the buzz cut, the whole nine yards for that one.
5681625	5682285	I'm thinking about it.
5682365	5683286	It's getting close to that.
5683906	5686088	That's dedicated.
5687662	5701787	No, I love... I love... Most of the veteran DJs, freestylers in, you know, in the city, basically, you know, they really like that, you know, they really have some good positive, you know, positive impressions on it when I first told it to them.
5703367	5707389	This would be Legend of Zaku doing freestyle at the Digital Life Tournament.
5708029	5708749	Oh, God.
5720776	5725658	That had to be it.
5725978	5728540	That's about it.
5728600	5731481	I told you what's been happening so far and what we already have.
5732801	5736803	Just waiting for October to roll by, pretty much.
5737363	5739004	So this tournament's going to be big news then, huh?
5739835	5743718	Yeah, I just hope you could try to pull something.
5743999	5751985	We'll see, but all you other East Coasters, I know we have other East Coasters listening to the show, make your way out to this tournament, because it's going to be freaking huge, and they're giving away money, lots of it.
5752566	5753246	Money, money, money.
5753907	5755568	Yeah, loads of money being given away.
5755669	5758471	Just at least try, man.
5760312	5764336	If someone buys me a ticket and it's on a weekend, I'll do it.
5764476	5765457	It is, the tournament's on a weekend.
5766314	5766994	It's on a weekend.
5767074	5769736	Someone buys me a ticket for Friday and flies me back Sunday.
5769776	5770116	I'll go.
5770316	5771617	JetBlue's got reasonable rates.
5772257	5773878	You don't want to fly Friday and Sunday.
5773918	5775238	I mean, it's all day flying.
5775258	5777700	With the time zones changing and everything, it's all day flying.
5778760	5779380	I don't need sleep.
5781081	5782802	We'll see what happens, Zaku.
5782982	5784083	We'll have a meeting on it.
5784203	5784403	Okay?
5784423	5785043	We'll have a meeting.
5785823	5786144	All right.
5786604	5787564	Take care, Zaku.
5787624	5788045	Have a good one.
5788465	5788745	Later.
5788845	5789345	Bye.
5791066	5792427	Skypline's open if you want to call in.
5792627	5793587	www.orange.com.
5793627	5794348	I was going to mention.
5794368	5795048	Don't interact with us.
5795919	5801981	Freeze Rolls, you know, that's really innovative because I've never seen that in another dance game, like Pump It Up or anything.
5803082	5803522	Stop.
5806283	5810704	You know, we're getting constructive feedback in the chat room that we're really mellow tonight.
5812485	5815366	Oh, I forgot to mention, I need a picture of me doing this show.
5815926	5816206	Why?
5816746	5820728	Because they're doing a little article about us in my...
5822145	5826988	Was it the, our kind of in-company magazine thing?
5827768	5833892	They want it because, you know, they're Can we just grab a screen capture of you from the No, I look retarded.
5834032	5835653	I don't want the retarded pictures.
5835953	5837714	I want a non-retarded picture.
5837794	5839135	That's what I was looking for.
5839655	5844338	And unfortunately, every single picture I've taken of, you know, me has been a retarded one.
5844618	5847319	I'm not retarded, so why do my pictures come out retarded?
5847360	5848120	That's what I want to know.
5850700	5851800	Oh yeah, picture of my foot.
5851840	5852801	That would be perfect.
5852901	5856782	Send the picture of your feet from the second movie.
5856802	5856842	No!
5857703	5857923	What?
5861084	5866286	Okay, now, Loki, we've just had a bit of anger, so DarkSakura, let's further us down the un-Mellow spiral.
5866346	5869727	There's somebody on the Gorillas board I post on.
5870707	5874869	I've been, by the way, made supermod on Gorillas Unofficial, which I'm very happy for.
5875728	5881753	But there's a person who, I'm not going to name names, but who posts 75 posts a day on average.
5881773	5883955	Does their name start with the letter S?
5884495	5884635	No.
5885196	5886076	The letter T?
5886457	5886597	No.
5887778	5891741	But there's a thread on here that says, describe the person above you.
5892541	5895083	And he put, does not love Katamari or his cousins.
5895984	5896404	I'm sorry.
5897105	5897725	He's the prince.
5897785	5898946	His name is not Katamari.
5900348	5900508	Ugh.
5900528	5903390	It just, people frustrate me.
5906357	5907578	It's video game related.
5908098	5909359	And you want to know what, though?
5909679	5913161	This isn't the only person that I have seen say stuff like this.
5914782	5916343	On a variety of boards.
5917264	5920946	They think that the primary character in a game is named after the game.
5921307	5921787	After the game.
5922888	5926790	Like, did you know that when you play Legend of Zelda, you're actually playing Zelda moving around?
5926830	5927811	Who thought that?
5927871	5928491	I know, I know.
5929052	5935756	But it's just... I would say that people, if they're going to be a fan of the game, actually know something about it.
5936865	5940927	See, in some cases you luck out because in Super Mario Bros.
5940948	5942829	you actually play as Super Mario.
5944810	5947871	Yeah, but I've heard people call Luigi Mario too.
5949892	5950593	And Green Mario.
5950673	5951293	This is back when.
5951313	5951993	Green Mario.
5952634	5953935	Yes, I kid you not.
5954555	5954795	All right.
5956181	5963667	I dug this up and I had to play it because it's been like three weeks since I've done this, so I need a little pick-me-up.
5964008	5965469	I need a little bit of Unmallow here.
5965489	5965549	God!
5966089	5967070	I already know what this is.
5967150	5969612	Hey, Loki, what do you think about gay sex?
5969953	5970973	Oh, it's so much fun.
5975818	5977339	That'll never get old, will it?
5978240	5979060	Actually, it will get old.
5979260	5981422	Because there's another joke we used to do the same thing for.
5981863	5982143	I know.
5982748	5985030	But then you'll just do something stupid and we'll have something else.
5986552	5986852	Hey!
5987473	5988053	I forgot.
5988093	5989695	Well, I actually didn't forget to mention.
5990756	5991517	September 11th.
5992738	5994440	No, we're not using that picture!
5996342	5999665	Thank you to the chat room listener who sent us that picture of Loki.
6002186	6007129	Yes, they had to pick the most retarded shot of me and... Sakurina, you can thank for that one.
6007149	6010991	Retarded, like, one second of the entire 20-minute interview.
6011151	6013972	It's actually a part of a much larger site.
6013992	6014953	I can show you this site here.
6015353	6016234	Yeah, I know, I know.
6019418	6022200	Those sites irritate the shit out of me.
6023020	6023821	But it's funny.
6024562	6025723	No, it's not funny.
6025743	6026543	I think it's funny.
6026563	6030146	And there's even a whole thread on DDR Freak dedicated to him in the imaging form.
6030226	6031107	Oh, never mind, never mind.
6031247	6036331	I was going to say... Whatever those things are, that internet joke needs to die.
6036651	6040314	YTMND, but that's not... What the fuck does that even mean anyway?
6040575	6040975	You're...
6042536	6044538	It's some catchphrase that started the whole thing.
6044738	6045579	And it's stupid!
6045699	6046099	Okay, wait.
6046279	6048941	But that was not an actual YTMND site.
6049102	6052644	That was the knockoff YTMND site.
6052664	6054546	That's actually somebody's placeholder for their real site.
6054846	6061291	However, we had another listener head on over to YTMND and actually came up with this.
6061451	6063092	And I'm loading this up right now for the chat.
6063833	6067056	Or for DarkSakura to... I'm not looking at it.
6067136	6067536	Yes, you are.
6068477	6069197	It's really funny.
6069317	6070378	Those things give me headaches.
6070458	6071339	I kid you not.
6072665	6073745	Oh, where's the graphic?
6074765	6077486	Hey, Loki, what do you think about gay sex?
6077826	6079906	Oh, it's so much fun.
6079967	6081527	Hey, Loki, what do you think about gay sex?
6081567	6083247	It actually shows Loki having gay sex.
6084067	6086748	Hey, Loki, what do you think about gay sex?
6087088	6088068	Oh, it's so much fun.
6088688	6091969	Hey, Loki, what do you think about... Yeah, and a picture of me drunk.
6093209	6096850	Anyways, September 11th, I'm going to be getting drunk here.
6100291	6101831	You're the man now, dawg.
6102216	6103717	That's what YTMND stands for.
6103757	6105579	I think it's something that Randy Jackson said once.
6106199	6108121	And by the way, I'm not trying to be mean about anybody.
6108141	6109422	I just had to vent for a moment.
6110623	6111764	Oh, yeah.
6112644	6113645	I made a public correction.
6113905	6116788	Okay, so September 11th, you're going to be drinking because it's your birthday, right?
6116928	6119109	So do you have the day after off work or something?
6119150	6119710	Yeah, sure, whatever.
6121652	6122372	All right, fine.
6125435	6125795	Okay.
6126502	6130904	Yeah, I actually had to load that YTMND site in Explorer.
6130964	6132105	It doesn't work in Firefox.
6132565	6138668	Because Firefox is smart to block those things that repeat the sound files over and over and the graphics over and over.
6138688	6139288	You know what, though?
6139728	6149993	Those things, it's like when they would give those, you know, when to entertain a blonde turnover, when to entertain a blonde turnover, it's the same type of stupid things.
6151949	6154410	You know, I did see a really, really funny one, though, once.
6155191	6158973	And it was the... I don't even know if I should repeat this on the air.
6159413	6162315	But it was that screen capture from Mike Tyson's Punch Out.
6162375	6164036	Remember when you would, like, beat a stage?
6164556	6168798	It would show, like, Little Mac in training, and he's running through, like, the streets of New York.
6169098	6178203	And it shows his coach, which was this really big, fat, black guy, remember, that, like, Al Roker used to be, that was on the bike, that was kind of riding in front of him and pacing him.
6178663	6178984	And it's...
6180664	6184205	It's, nigga stole my bike.
6185766	6194088	And it's just really funny because that's not really what's happening in the picture, but then when you look at it in that perspective and it shows a little animation, it kind of looks like it.
6194729	6195969	That the guy stole his bike.
6196576	6197777	Those things don't amuse me.
6197797	6198877	That's the funniest one I ever saw.
6199097	6202599	I think that those are meant to amuse the easily amused.
6203420	6204941	And I'd say complex amusement.
6206061	6209143	I need something with more substance to amuse me.
6209163	6209923	What do they call those?
6212084	6213485	You have snobby humor.
6214806	6215746	I can't help it.
6215766	6217567	You're stuck up when it comes to your humor.
6217587	6220269	I did the little humor thing in my live journal.
6223230	6223631	Anyway.
6224771	6225832	Enough about YTMND.
6227993	6229895	An enema.
6229915	6230135	Yeah.
6249608	6251889	Speaking of Mark Caldwell... I had to make a Batman reference.
6253410	6257171	Have you seen... Well, Walken was in one of the... Walken for President!
6257191	6258132	I was just going to bring this up.
6258152	6260653	This is this big internet site that's been going around the internet.
6260673	6263194	Walken2008.com or .org.
6263314	6264055	You know what?
6264435	6266576	I'm not going to... I'm sure it's fake.
6266696	6268096	Yeah, I was pretty sure it's fake.
6268136	6271478	But the thing is, if something like that were to pass,
6272045	6278227	First of all, you need to make sure that if they're going to, if somebody's going to run for president, put all of the issues up there first and foremost.
6278247	6280868	That site was very, very poorly done.
6281508	6282388	Very poorly done.
6282508	6287550	Well, the domain register or whatever was like Lola Skates or whatever.
6287970	6288750	Lola Skates.
6289390	6290471	So, yeah.
6292331	6292731	Alright.
6294352	6297533	Anyway, I think it's about time we get into the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match.
6297973	6298733	How's that sound, kids?
6299473	6300734	Sounds terrific.
6301354	6301754	Why not?
6302881	6305342	Okay, so which song of mine did we use last week that won?
6305362	6306902	Whatever the first one you put in there was.
6307002	6307383	Okay.
6307403	6307843	On the disc.
6308063	6308803	I gotta remember.
6308863	6311204	I hope, uh... We could just start over.
6311924	6314645	Yeah, I'm in trouble because I don't know if I remember which song it was.
6316066	6316786	Well, let's start over.
6316906	6318126	Do you have any idea what song it was?
6318907	6319507	Fuck if I know.
6319527	6320807	What are my choices?
6320947	6323108	Shit, somebody in chat help us out.
6323408	6324029	I'm sorry, Rob.
6326429	6327850	You didn't like the song, I assume.
6328830	6330551	No, because it sounded generic.
6331156	6334198	Yeah, I purposely put a generic one in there because I knew you'd love those ones.
6337319	6338180	Oh, this is great.
6338220	6339500	We should do a cowbell mix.
6340801	6343743	Was it Jet Set in the Name of Love?
6343783	6344323	No, that wasn't it.
6344363	6345143	I did that one earlier.
6347064	6348845	Why don't we start with the Challengers tonight?
6348865	6352247	That's because you use iTunes.
6352647	6355949	I seriously don't know what song I had left in the cage match.
6356269	6357209	So I guess we'll start over.
6357970	6358190	Fine.
6359244	6360185	So we'll start over tonight.
6360225	6367675	So I gotta find a song, and while I find a song, we're gonna start off with DarkSakura's pick, because it's the only one I have ready to go.
6368055	6370178	So DarkSakura, what did you pick tonight for tonight's game match?
6371620	6379949	I put it in the afterbirth before, not the afterbirth, the fortune cookie.
6380669	6384093	But I couldn't think of anything else and MC Chris is just awesome.
6384133	6386095	So it's MC Chris with Geek.
6387376	6391000	Alright, song number one in tonight's cage match, MC Chris with Geek.
6391361	6391761	Here it is.
6392322	6392542	Enjoy.
6410922	6422731	I'm a geek, spread G-double-E-K, I beat my boys in the basement about every day, a card table called
6454522	6480211	Costumes and their cops, otherwise known as the motherfuckers touch the tit If I was Wolverine, you'd hear my knockers go stick, I'm not perfect The big false picture, Peter Parker, always tripping, drop my tray in front of the girl that always fucks with I got brains, fucks, B's and C's, I got a grade point average higher than Henderson and your Z-boy Take it on me, because I'm a B, I'll take to you, you'll take to me, well one day
6485407	6487409	Thank you for watching!
6501243	6502024	Thank you for watching!
6523245	6543443	The Dragon died from a heart attack You may advance and you're up to armor class Being a geek, it ain't so bad I can't get laid, I got your pantomime stashed In a mind jam-packed with sci-fi facts Dread knocks, rock down a bike, kick ass Stop hanging on me I love you I'm hanging on you
6551119	6553460	Thank you for watching!
6571753	6598693	I'm a geek, I'm strange to you, you're strange to me Well one day, I'm gonna pack you, your brain is on the wall My face, my face is on TV, because I'm a geek I'm strange to you, you're strange to me Well one day
6609406	6609746	All right.
6610606	6613548	Song number one in tonight's Cage Match, MC Chris with Geek.
6613608	6619711	Remember, you guys will be voting for your favorite, and then that winner will go into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio.
6621516	6624959	But we'll give you our opinions first and try to sway your vote.
6624999	6627301	So, DarkSakura, it was your pick, but what did you think?
6627681	6633786	It's MC Chris, he gets a 10, just because that song is like high school for how many people ever?
6634867	6637850	It's the perfect description.
6638710	6639031	Loki?
6640152	6640572	I guess a 7.
6640872	6642293	I just wasn't feeling it.
6643775	6644095	I don't know.
6646362	6652505	For me, MC Chris is kind of one of those folks where I think the joke gets old for me.
6652986	6654627	I think he's kind of a niche guy.
6654927	6656247	I don't think it's a joke.
6656527	6657268	I do, sorry.
6657468	6657828	I give it a 6.
6659629	6661490	Because it did have a catchy hook, I'll give it that.
6661650	6667093	And it was, he doesn't have chicks singing in most of his songs, so that was kind of a neat little addition.
6668174	6668874	Alright, moving on.
6669374	6670675	Loki, you want to go next or you want me to go next?
6672236	6672656	Whatever.
6672876	6673496	You go next then.
6673536	6674857	What did you pick tonight?
6675239	6677561	I picked this song from Wipeout Pure.
6678582	6679983	Hell if I remember what it's called.
6680503	6683386	How about, let me give you a hint, it's called Onyx by Cold Storage.
6683726	6685267	Yeah, Onyx by Cold Storage.
6685447	6689531	It's the first levels music and it's cool.
6689751	6692933	And it's my fallback pick because I couldn't find shit.
6693194	6694235	Oh, that's always impressive.
6695095	6697297	So, yeah, it's not bad.
6697557	6699058	I liked it, but, you know, whatever.
6699219	6700880	Alright, here we go, song number two.
6702221	6703062	Cold Storage with Onyx.
6766048	6766773	Thanks for watching!
6812613	6813316	Thanks for watching!
7030979	7033522	Song number two, Cold Storage with Onyx.
7034243	7036805	Let's see what we thought of that, DarkSakura.
7037806	7039208	Generic, five, sorry.
7039968	7040329	Loki.
7041630	7044473	It gets a nine, because it's better than MC Chris.
7045774	7049959	I also give that song a six, because I found it to be pretty generic as well, I have to say.
7050379	7050639	Sorry.
7053416	7056360	Alright, let's go to my pick, song number three tonight.
7056660	7059163	Since I can't remember what won the cage match two weeks ago.
7059183	7060565	Oh, it was something generic.
7060765	7063489	Yeah, something generic that I would have given a six anyway, so let's just...
7064107	7065208	Let's just go to a new song.
7065828	7067869	I'm going to pick this, and I hope that this isn't generic.
7067909	7071711	I actually decided to not do a trance-type song tonight.
7072031	7076834	I'm doing something... There's this band I absolutely love, and a lot of America loves this band too.
7076874	7079736	It's Frow Frow, and you might remember I used to whore the cage match with these guys.
7081217	7085519	And they had a big song that was in the movie Garden State called Let Go, and it was really big and stuff.
7085799	7088961	Well, Imogen Heap, who's the singer, she just recently...
7090186	7091667	I am in love with you.
7091707	7092007	Enjoy.
7122469	7147387	I am in love with you I am in love with you, baby I am in love with you Only for the moment Right now, another piece Right now, another piece Just like that, oh
7198150	7199560	Thanks for watching!
7257917	7259853	Thanks for watching!
7295799	7298381	Song number three, Imogen Heap, I Am In Love With You.
7298441	7301184	Let's see if we were in love with that or if we want to break up.
7301264	7303406	DarkSakura.
7303706	7308490	You know, I really like her stuff, but it sounded really kind of repetitive.
7308511	7311293	In fact, a lot of her stuff sounds the same.
7312554	7315477	It wasn't bad at all, so it gets a 7.5.
7316478	7317158	All righty, Loki.
7319260	7321342	It was okay.
7321442	7321802	It gets a 7.
7324142	7332406	Um, I have to give that song like an 8, because she does have way better songs on the CD, but unfortunately they're kind of like depressing, like emo type stuff.
7332526	7335188	No, I don't want, well actually I shouldn't say that, because I want people to listen to this.
7335688	7338469	It's not like garbage emo music, it's really good stuff.
7339070	7341111	Hey, garbage is cool.
7341351	7342291	Yeah, like garbage is cool.
7342511	7345233	No, but um, you know what I mean though.
7345473	7351416	But that particular song is kind of um, it's the more upbeat one, if you could call it that, even though the lyrics are kind of depressing.
7352136	7352957	Uh, so I give it an 8.
7353905	7360789	Alright, actually no, I give it a 6, so that way I've given all three songs tonight a 6, and that's 666, so that would be cool.
7361570	7363831	Anyway, yeah I'm lame, shut up.
7364371	7366472	Let's recap and then you guys can place your votes.
7366532	7378580	Song number one you can vote for tonight was MC Chris with Geek.
7379040	7382242	And song number two you can vote for tonight is Cold Storage Onyx.
7391766	7395088	And song number three tonight, Imogen Heap, I'm In Love With You.
7404853	7407654	Okay guys, place vote now.
7407754	7413417	Send a private message to Sky with your vote for song number one, song number two, or song number three.
7414098	7420861	And we will reveal those votes as soon as we have them added all up.
7421423	7425927	Loki, this is the part of the show where I'd like to go to you for a sim scene update.
7426368	7432053	You know, and normally I'd say I don't have anything, but I actually do, surprisingly enough.
7432113	7440160	First thing is, Food Mix 2 finally has a goddamn date that's going to be released, and that goddamn date will be September 15th.
7440661	7444484	And what can you expect but 50 new songs, so that's pretty awesome.
7445686	7446106	So, yeah.
7446980	7449682	That'll be something we'll be covering a little bit more a bit later on.
7450182	7454725	The other thing is that TourneyMix 6 Download Pack 1 is available.
7454745	7457887	I have not actually downloaded Download Pack 1, but it's up there.
7458267	7463370	So if you go to ddrei.com, you can visit the last of TourneyMix.
7463871	7465292	I'm sure we're all thankful for that.
7466272	7470175	And yeah, I think that's pretty much all I had right now.
7470195	7471636	I know there's some other ones, but I can't remember.
7473237	7473497	But yeah.
7474904	7476885	So, Food Mix 2, that's pretty awesome.
7479366	7480246	Alright, super.
7480406	7481087	Food Mix news.
7481667	7481927	Yeah.
7482307	7483668	I'm excited about Food Mix 2.
7484228	7489370	Now, see, if In The Groove was like Food Mix 2... It would be awesome.
7489950	7491791	If Food Mix 2, that's the thing.
7491871	7492911	It's got polish to it.
7493031	7495412	I mean, everything, it looks professional.
7495452	7503976	It looks like, honestly, if they put it in its own game, if Konami were to go to the Food Mix guys and say, hey, make us a game, we'll publish it for you.
7506388	7507792	It would be a DDR game.
7507972	7508433	It would look good.
7513286	7516268	I want to mention this because we hadn't really gotten a chance to yet.
7516608	7517909	Actually, there's a couple things I want to talk about.
7517949	7519530	Let's go to this.
7520270	7523812	This is a story about the Pump It Up US song list.
7524153	7527895	Apparently, some folks are actually already getting a hold of this game somehow.
7527935	7530917	I think it's because they're in the industry, so they know people that know people.
7531177	7536761	But for the rest of us, we get it on the 31st of this month, I want to say, is when Pump It Up comes out.
7537101	7537581	Get this.
7538842	7540263	101 songs on the song list.
7540748	7542348	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7566756	7567056	U.S.
7567377	7581770	Known Songs, Name of the Game, Crystal Method, Walkie Talkie Man, Stereogram, I Love You Baby, Pandera, Let's Groove, Earth, Wind & Fire, Little Less Conversation, and Rapper's Delight by the Sugarhill Gang.
7587615	7590156	Also some K-pop coming over, which I think is kind of cool.
7590877	7592037	Just a whole lot of other songs.
7592157	7594718	I'm just kind of scanning through the list, seeing what I can find in here.
7598400	7601241	Come to Me and Funky Tonight by Klon, of course, are coming over.
7602462	7606764	Empire of the Sun, Nova Sonic, Boa, Valenti.
7608445	7609845	Boa, that's cool.
7609965	7611266	Yeah, I thought that was pretty cool, too.
7613507	7615508	Let's see, what else is on here that I recognize?
7616548	7617609	Shake It Up by Rod.
7617969	7627133	So, you know what guys, just head on over to Beat, or I'm sorry, either BomaniStyle.com has the list, or there's actually a thread in the DDRUK forum as well that both have the list.
7627734	7628214	Check it out.
7629475	7636518	I'm actually, you know, even though I said earlier in the show, I actually prefer Intergroup to Pump It Up because I don't like Pump It Up's interface, I still want to give the home version a shot.
7636558	7642221	I think it might be fun to play at home, and especially with like 101 freaking songs, that's going to be hard to wear out.
7642281	7643682	So I definitely will check this game out.
7644150	7644991	and let you know what I think.
7645391	7647013	I wish I could have gotten an advance copy.
7649796	7650116	Alright.
7653880	7659286	So, um, speaking of Pump It Up, we're working on some little extra news we might have on that for a little later in the show.
7659306	7661928	Also, we gotta talk about DDR with fire.
7663490	7664451	Well, um,
7665612	7668753	Dance Dance Emulation, we talked about it a while back.
7668833	7672134	There was going to be a Burning Man and this fire festival that's in Oakland.
7673074	7674315	I was just about to get to this, yes.
7674615	7678116	I've been teasing it like the whole show and now I'm finally getting to it, but that's alright.
7680117	7682577	It looks awesome from what I've seen gameplay-wise.
7682937	7690360	It had a lot of hardware trouble though because I guess the pads broke, the thing crashed, all that type of thing.
7690620	7694641	But I got to see, there's a little bit of footage on the website actually that shows
7695310	7706397	Yes, actually DDR Freak posted a video about this, and I wanted to show this, if I could get to it, so we could have a little bit of movie nights.
7706537	7708358	And now, oh darn it, I can't find the video.
7708738	7711860	Let me, I can bring it up again real fast here.
7712380	7715162	So you actually watched the video, Loki, of this?
7715282	7715482	Yes.
7716082	7716623	And what did you think?
7716643	7717743	Oh, it was interesting.
7717963	7721926	The guy in the suit reminded me of the Bunnymen from the Intel commercials.
7722066	7722386	But, uh,
7723354	7724674	It was an interesting idea.
7724914	7733156	I don't know, it's just one of those Burning Man things, because they've got a lot of weird things that they do at Burning Man, and that would be one of them.
7734656	7735816	You crazy kids.
7736236	7737197	It looks interesting.
7738097	7740417	Yeah.
7740437	7741057	Let me see, let me see.
7741277	7743018	Because, Jamie, you probably haven't seen this yet, right?
7743698	7744458	Probably not.
7744478	7745298	Let me show this to you here.
7746118	7746878	I can't see through you.
7747018	7747919	Hold on, I'm going to move.
7747939	7749039	I've just got to open this up first.
7749059	7750019	Okay, here it comes.
7751914	7753015	Oh, wait, we need some music.
7753155	7753655	We need some music.
7753715	7753955	Hold on.
7754035	7754616	Oh, yeah, I have.
7755116	7755416	Did you?
7755496	7756076	Oh, here it is again.
7760199	7761480	Playing a little After the Game of Love.
7762160	7763541	Then, whoosh, fire!
7765862	7767043	Whoosh, fire!
7768284	7770585	Yep, that's pretty much Dance to Assimilation.
7770665	7771566	Whoosh, fire!
7772046	7772966	Hey, fire is cool.
7772986	7774387	DDR whoosh fire mix.
7778770	7778810	Um...
7782095	7782575	I'll say it.
7782716	7783596	What a stupid idea.
7784756	7785416	I'm sorry.
7786277	7790238	Now if he really caught on fire and was dancing on fire, that might be cool.
7790278	7795479	This is somebody's inside joke gone like way, way, way too far.
7795539	7800621	I'm just waiting for someone to set themselves on fire because they saw him and they blame it on dancing.
7800661	7808723	I love it because on the DDR Freak story it says, you know, it links to the article and everything and it says, note, we urge you not to try this at home.
7809024	7810184	You know, like, you know what?
7810973	7812153	Don't even put the disclaimer.
7812253	7813354	Let somebody try it at home.
7813414	7814394	That's Darwinism, kids.
7815034	7815614	No, it's all good.
7819415	7819755	You know what?
7819815	7822776	I want someone to try it at home so I can submit their story to the Darwin Awards.
7824936	7830798	I don't get it because everybody's talking about this sensation of being blasted with fire and all this stuff.
7830838	7833478	Or you can feel the sensation of being blasted with fire.
7833538	7837619	Okay, A. If you want to feel the sensation of being blasted with fire, become a firefighter.
7838040	7839740	B. If that's not for you or whatever...
7840882	7845803	Because you're wearing all these protective gear, I mean, I understand that there's that heat sensation or something.
7846063	7849224	And I'm just knocking on this, I guess, because it's not something I would ever really want to do.
7849504	7850724	I'm just not interested in it.
7850864	7856685	Like, I'm also not, you know, just like, I don't really want to visit Central Mexico.
7856986	7858066	So I'm not going to do it, ever.
7858446	7860746	I don't really want to play Dance Dance Simulation.
7860766	7862127	Go out and get laid!
7862147	7866048	There are more things better than fire being blasted in your face.
7866828	7867928	Like a good woman.
7870509	7871970	Go get laid, honestly.
7872030	7873490	That's what you need to do.
7873510	7875111	I think a woman co-designed this game.
7876011	7877812	Some prostitutes are cheaper than DDR.
7877852	7879893	I'm surprised the whole set up didn't blow up then.
7881814	7882354	Whoa!
7882815	7885616	Whoa, did you hear that joke you just made?
7885956	7886576	Excuse me?
7887176	7888137	Repeat thyself?
7888877	7890478	You should have listened in the first place.
7891084	7892865	No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
7893205	7899009	If you want to hear that joke, you can tune in to the rewinds that we have on DVR Freak Radio.
7899289	7904393	No, no, we would be able to listen to it if someone would remember to upload it to DVR Freak's server.
7904733	7908695	I've been out a couple weeks, and we will get back in the swing of those very soon.
7909076	7910396	I think they're playing one from a month ago.
7911497	7913478	I'm going to shangle you with the mic cord now.
7939619	7941180	From now on, Loki will be a ghost.
7941480	7942881	He will be here in spirit only.
7944102	7945022	When I get around to it.
7947844	7949265	Anyways, no.
7950305	7952887	But see, at Burning Man, if it blew up, it'd be good.
7953728	7954068	I don't know.
7955489	7955949	Oh, man.
7956669	7957010	Why?
7959111	7959411	Why?
7959891	7960211	I don't know.
7960652	7960892	I just...
7964344	7969367	I don't feel like you're really feeling the sensation of fire because you're wearing a protective suit all over.
7969507	7972109	So it's like it kind of takes away from that.
7972149	7974490	It's like, feel like what it's like to get shot.
7974550	7976672	Here's a bulletproof vest, you know?
7978393	7987698	And you know somebody's going to come up with this, like, dance, dance, you know, South Central, where you've got to dodge the bullets that get shot at you if you miss a step.
7987718	7990420	Feel what it's like to get married and get kicked in the nuts.
7994645	7995405	I don't appreciate that.
7995705	7997766	Yeah, you two are the ones getting married in this next year.
7997826	7998846	I'm not, so whatever.
8000426	8000827	Alright.
8004287	8005228	We're going to go to a break.
8005868	8008088	When we come back from the break, more stuff.
8008288	8009749	Also, tonight's cage match winner.
8010329	8015530	I haven't even started looking at the votes yet, so we'll get to all that when we come back after a quick break.
8016210	8019191	And I think I have the appropriate song to start us off this break.
8019391	8022752	So we'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.
8053570	8054491	Alright!
8054511	8055231	Y'all put them in!
8055252	8056092	Get the pressure!
8056172	8058294	You've had the time to rest!
8058314	8059215	Which is coming to an end!
8059235	8060155	And we start again!
8060236	8061216	One, two, three, FIRE!
8117779	8118660	Happy New Year!
8118740	8119641	Happy New Year!
8119701	8121543	Happy New Year, everybody!
8121603	8122524	Happy New Year!
8122564	8123465	Happy New Year!
8123505	8124346	Happy New Year!
8124366	8125047	Happy New Year!
8162296	8180172	I feel you, I feel you, I feel you every way I feel you, I feel you, I say to you every night I feel you, I feel you, I feel you every way I feel you, I feel you, I feel you every way I feel you, I feel you, I feel you every way I feel you, I feel you, I say to you every night
8197791	8205894	I see you, I see you, I see you every wedding I see you, I see you, I say to you every day I see you, I see you, I say to you every day I see you
8222532	8223253	Thank you for watching!
8309834	8322003	I'm living through the mist of love to find the place my heart belongs I'm living through the mist of love to find my place my home
8399225	8401086	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, DJ Ranma
8446693	8452897	Orange Lounge Radio Mamani Music and more Howdy kids, welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio
8474984	8490129	and in that break you heard some Fire from Disney's Rave, Happy Wedding from 2DX7Style, Lion Musashi with Thunder from 2DX8, and DJ Doc with Pump It Up, I'm sorry, with Run To You from Pump It Up.
8490189	8491109	I read it backwards, sorry.
8493170	8493610	Anyway, I want...
8495756	8500219	We did that at karaoke on the E3 trip.
8500379	8500759	What?
8502120	8506363	Run to you, because we went to a Korean karaoke bar.
8506783	8508104	Oh, you went to a Korean karaoke bar.
8508204	8513607	I remember the Korean arcade at Cyber Beat, but you didn't go to Cyber Beat, did you?
8513767	8516949	No, but we went to a Korean karaoke place.
8517570	8520992	And actually, I did a song off the Japanese list, but it was all in English.
8521032	8522213	It was Boa.
8522933	8523033	Ah.
8523994	8524014	I...
8524997	8529200	Can't forget at the Korean Arcade, the Cyber Zone, I think it's called.
8529240	8530100	I hope it's still around.
8530120	8530961	It was a cute little place.
8531601	8532882	Where they were having this tournament.
8532902	8534443	They had karaoke booths in the back.
8534763	8538345	But it was the kind of thing where you'd lock yourself in and you'd put in a couple tokens and you could sing a song.
8538725	8541587	And I swear to God, Rice Princess and I were in there the entire tournament.
8541607	8543948	We probably missed the whole tournament thanks to those karaoke rooms.
8544209	8547130	I was singing Cyndi Lauper and I was singing, you know, just everything.
8547370	8547691	Everything.
8548111	8548451	It was fun.
8548491	8551453	And it would grade you when you were done, which I thought was kind of weird.
8551673	8558777	Well, yeah, but that's like almost typical of just about every other karaoke thing I've done except for the ones like where we normally go to karaoke.
8559017	8559237	Yeah.
8561419	8563900	Anyway, I actually wanted to mention something about Pump It Up.
8564020	8566401	We actually have a little bit of an exclusive here.
8566721	8568963	So we have a tip from our buddy Maple.
8570824	8576347	He's sharing this with us so that we can tell you guys that Banya, with the song...
8577000	8579442	And I'm going to fuck up the pronunciation of this.
8579802	8583584	Ni-sance, N-A-I-S-S-A-N-C-E, Ni-sance.
8584485	8585365	Ni-sance, I don't know.
8585765	8586226	Ni-sance.
8586486	8586946	Ni-sance.
8587486	8592970	This song will actually be unlocked in survival mode in Pump It Up.
8593290	8595912	So that's not on any of the song lists that are already out there.
8595992	8597112	So go figure.
8598712	8602373	If you didn't know, the way that Pump It Up, the home version works, it's got like different modes.
8602793	8604913	Home mode has no life bars in it.
8605393	8607494	The arcade mode is like the arcade.
8607794	8611055	But survival mode, when your life bar runs out, you lose.
8611355	8614295	So there's these different modes you can play that kind of alter the life mode.
8614335	8615216	Am I playing the right way?
8615336	8616816	You will get this new Bonnie song.
8617116	8617536	You know what?
8617636	8622797	If I was any good at Pump It Up, I think I would dig the one that doesn't have a life bar.
8622817	8623838	Yeah.
8623978	8625638	I'm going to... I'm going to...
8627389	8627949	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
8657891	8660213	Something else I wanted to share with you guys, an anonymous tip from the chat room.
8660233	8661854	Well, not so much an anonymous tip, actually.
8661894	8666196	This came to us from, I believe, Dark Knight sent this over to me, and if I messed that up, I'm very sorry.
8666897	8677403	This was a link on IGN.com, actually, that talks about a preview for a new Nintendo DS music game from the people that made Guitar Man.
8678384	8678824	Osu!
8678904	8679584	Tatake!
8680705	8681285	Oendan!
8681726	8682946	Let me see, let me see, let me see.
8682966	8683967	Excuse me, I'm using the laptop.
8685154	8686195	Yeah, I saw that one.
8686255	8687135	It's weird looking.
8687235	8688977	Well, how so, Loki?
8690498	8691518	It looks like... Tatakai.
8692719	8694060	Tatakai means fight.
8694840	8698443	Oendan, I'm not quite sure, but it means, hey, fight something.
8698903	8699683	Alright.
8700184	8707168	It looks funny because there's like these three guys dancing and stuff, and there's this guy that looks like yelling at them, and I don't really know what that was.
8707569	8709710	I was just based off the pictures that I saw in there.
8710993	8711493	Interesting.
8712474	8724966	Basically, it involves three soldier-type guys that are going around the town, and they motivate people with manly poses, but it's up to the player to control just how well that they can motivate.
8725347	8732214	So it's kind of like a follow-the-pattern-type challenge, and it matches the beat of the song that's being played, of course, using the touchscreen.
8732774	8740738	During the song, a series of numbered circles pop up on screen as the player is tasked to tap the circle to the rhythm of the song.
8747822	8748503	TechnicBeat is confusing.
8763405	8766087	Yeah, but this song sounds like it's just you tap on the right circles.
8766147	8767608	So that should be interesting there.
8768508	8769249	But that's not it.
8769449	8772651	There's also pathways in the game where you don't just tap.
8772911	8774432	They're a little bit longer of a beat.
8774492	8777954	You have to tap and drag your stylus to the beat.
8779115	8782577	It's like a virtual volleyball, one end of the path to another and back again.
8782977	8785639	So that's kind of the guitar-managed part of it.
8785679	8786880	That should be very interesting.
8787140	8788361	Rob, spell that last one for me.
8788601	8790422	O-U-E-N-D-A-N?
8791189	8792490	O-U-E-N-D-A-N, yes.
8792810	8793931	Okay, I'm going to see what that means.
8793951	8794592	Alright.
8795513	8795873	Okay.
8797354	8800637	Alright, let's get to tonight's cage match winner, boys and girls.
8800697	8802118	I know you've been waiting a while to hear it.
8802158	8805461	Tonight's cage match winner was won by one vote.
8805501	8807883	And I have to say tonight, kids, not a lot of votes tonight.
8808303	8809764	I'm very pissed at your apathy.
8811145	8812827	But for those of you guys that did vote, thank you.
8812847	8813647	They're being too emo.
8813867	8814708	Yeah, I guess so.
8814788	8817050	Maybe they were too wrapped up in the emo chick song.
8817390	8819072	Unfortunately, that's not the song that won tonight.
8819092	8820052	The song that won tonight was...
8822407	8826411	Onyx by Cold Storage with one vote over MC Chris.
8827632	8828032	Sadness.
8828692	8829593	Hooray for generic.
8831034	8832536	Hey, I don't have to pick a song next week.
8833256	8834818	Yeah, yeah, yeah, rub it in.
8835038	8835578	Rub it in.
8836499	8840963	Alright, and to those of you guys... I think, though... To those of you guys who didn't vote, poop on you.
8841163	8846868	I think going into that, though, I think that it's highly appropriate to have, uh... You know...
8847501	8848161	DarkSakura
8871883	8874424	I've never put that in there for you since you never seem to be able to find it.
8874505	8875465	Thank you, I appreciate that.
8875485	8877326	We're going to have to do this next week.
8877426	8882229	I have some funny music that you can use for game show stuff.
8882789	8884850	I put it on my card especially for you guys.
8884890	8886111	I'm sorry, this isn't about ranting.
8887116	8888857	Fight, Kill, Blood Makes Grass Grow
8911172	8915674	Actually, that used to be our homecoming chant every year because our rival school for homecoming was McGill.
8916254	8917214	So it was Kill McGill.
8918395	8919295	Blood makes the grass grow.
8920035	8921736	This used to be our cheer.
8922356	8924056	And this kind of ties into the next segment here.
8924076	8925597	So I'll kick it off with a little cheer.
8925617	8927077	I'm going to kick off tonight's FU's with a little cheer.
8927097	8927938	You're going to be our cheerleader.
8927958	8928338	Yes, I am.
8928378	8928898	Okay, ready?
8928918	8930038	Has it already been broughten?
8930499	8932379	Yes, I'm broughtening it right now.
8932719	8934120	Okay, give me a cue.
8935180	8935640	Cue.
8935800	8936661	Give me a cue.
8936861	8937261	Cue.
8937441	8938261	Give me a cue.
8938341	8938601	Cue.
8938822	8939622	Give me a cue.
8939802	8940202	Shut up.
8941041	8941922	What's that spell?
8942762	8943363	4Q!
8944503	8944904	You know what?
8944924	8945324	We had one.
8945704	8945944	Rob.
8946164	8946364	What?
8946485	8950587	Give me B. B. Give me another B. B. Give me another B. B. What's that spell?
8950947	8951107	3B?
8953809	8955610	You're retarded.
8955630	8957732	That was a band cheer, okay?
8957912	8959733	Okay, why are we doing the 4Q of the week?
8960634	8962615	Because we're full of emo.
8971807	8972567	My first F.U.
8972607	8974107	goes to people who like generic crap.
8976368	8977108	My second F.U.
8977708	8992092	of the week goes towards just being given random assignments at work and then having to go back and do everybody else's stuff because certain people decided not to come into work that day and aren't going to be in the next week.
8992132	8993313	So I get to do it again, yay!
8995994	8996234	F.U.
8996294	8997054	goes toward...
8998815	9006341	Having to basically do a lot of the wedding crap on my own, although I've been getting a bit more support as of late.
9006942	9015769	Well, it's not really that I'm doing it on my own, it's just that there's certain things about it that are more important to me than they are to the other party in my wedding.
9016170	9018471	You guys should do a reality show about my wedding.
9018492	9018532	No!
9018852	9020233	Hell no, okay?
9020293	9020833	Hell no.
9021114	9023135	This is close enough to reality.
9023936	9024917	More like unreality.
9027913	9040782	Another SU goes toward the fact that Dan lent our Xbox out to his friend and I've been sort of having the urge to play Halo 2 even though I get sickening... I get motion sick on that game.
9041402	9046006	But I want to go back to the Earth level and run all over the rooftops.
9049881	9052063	and, uh, another F.U.
9052103	9056546	goes to my puppy demo for only being five minutes long, because I love playing Frisbee with puppies.
9058007	9059088	You don't have much longer to wait.
9061830	9064431	And, uh, what the... Something for the podcast, sorry.
9064932	9065232	Sorry.
9065672	9067794	Um... I just had a tiny little fanboy orgasm, though.
9068374	9068614	F.U.
9068674	9071877	goes to Loki for showing Rob Crabtor my F.U.
9072517	9075359	Excuse me, it's my moment, okay.
9076460	9076540	Um...
9079033	9081214	Animal Crossing DS needs to be out like now.
9081354	9082535	Dude, when's that supposed to be out?
9082875	9083455	Eventually.
9083915	9084496	November.
9085476	9086236	Aw, fuck them.
9086737	9093580	F you to not being able to register for my wedding.
9094280	9101364	Because, you know, I want to register and all this because, you know, I don't care what people say about, you know, don't send me gifts.
9101484	9104225	When you get married, people feel obligated to give you a present.
9105071	9106231	You know, it's just how things are.
9106892	9109452	So, I want Amazon gift certificates.
9110252	9110813	And that's it.
9110913	9112453	How many toasters do you want, seriously?
9113033	9113833	We don't eat bread.
9114114	9114914	Exactly.
9114974	9116514	I don't fucking need a toaster.
9117515	9118815	So, yeah.
9118935	9125637	As you to the traditional ideas of having to give people, like, household goods for their wedding, just give me Amazon gift certificates.
9125917	9126357	I'll be happy.
9127877	9128218	That's it.
9130178	9133139	Let DarkSakura save up so she can buy many copies of the Kama Sutra.
9134838	9135539	I don't need that.
9136339	9138480	Oh, why would you need many copies of it?
9138861	9140702	You know, just to have in various rooms of the house.
9141282	9141923	Loki's turn.
9143804	9152089	Well, you know, the only thing I have to say fuck you to is the people that stole my fiancé's car because that sucks.
9152650	9154371	I wouldn't want that happening to my car.
9154691	9156432	But I was right, wasn't I?
9156852	9160975	Luckily, my car has a security system, so, you know.
9162352	9162672	Gamey.
9163452	9165553	And then, um, fuck you too.
9166373	9168534	A lot of the games out there are just sucking ass.
9168714	9173596	Especially, like, for example, Petite Copter 2, which was a waste of my time.
9173656	9174796	Don't import that game ever.
9175337	9177217	It looks strange, but not strange enough.
9178318	9184760	And, um, yeah, and also fuck you too, that stupid, um, Jack whatever his name is.
9184800	9186241	I don't even want to, you know.
9186561	9187281	Jack Thompson?
9187421	9188081	Jack Thompson!
9188221	9188821	The idiot?
9188861	9189962	Freaking idiot.
9191201	9193542	Oh, no, no, no, I'm gonna bring up later on about VG Cats.
9193923	9203748	But he, you know, he just has to go out there and just, you know, perpetuate the let's not blame the parents for our kids' problems, let's blame someone else stereotype.
9203968	9206369	So anyways, to hell with him, I hope he dies.
9207389	9209731	In some ironic way that has to do with video games.
9211512	9211812	I'm done.
9219867	9222848	An F you to Nintendo for not having Animal Crossing DS out like now.
9223109	9230512	An F you to the fact that they're not putting the classic Nintendo games in there because they found out they can make money from it the other way, so you can suck it.
9232113	9235815	An F you to the fact that I was gone for so long, although I did kind of enjoy the East Coast.
9235855	9239477	I really missed home, and I missed people, and yeah, all that.
9239577	9240737	I miss you guys!
9242698	9243499	But my aim's improving.
9243519	9247621	You owe me rent on that, you know.
9250006	9253429	I used to have that bumper sticker on my car like years ago when I really hated my ex.
9253669	9254210	We're friends now.
9254730	9256051	Anyway, none of that matters.
9258493	9268682	I don't know, just an F you to the fact that I'm... An F you to the fact that I've got a lot of drama going on in other places that don't have to do with the show or anything.
9269463	9272966	But I can't really say it on air either, so just an F you to all that drama going on there.
9273987	9276289	And an F you to... An F you to...
9280106	9281527	Me, because I have nothing else to say.
9281687	9282747	Stuff, angst in general.
9282927	9286028	You'd think I'd have a lot of more FUs for my travel, but I really don't.
9287249	9289650	Just an FU to Southwest for being a crappy airline.
9291070	9298393	By the way, I'm going to change my FU theme, because I have to go find it to download, to the Mighty Mosh and Emo Rangers theme.
9299554	9301275	Whatever, maybe we should all change our themes again.
9301295	9301955	I don't know, we'll see.
9302655	9305336	Alright, let's move on, boys and girls.
9305736	9308658	I made a funny in the song I picked for chatroom FUs tonight.
9308678	9309578	See if you can catch the joke.
9314861	9316402	Misty says, fuck gas prices.
9316422	9318963	They're currently at around $2.53 a gallon here right now.
9319203	9321664	Hey, $2.69 in my neighborhood, honey.
9321864	9323104	You should have picked Tetra Q, though.
9324445	9327166	And I heard it's going to jump to $3 tomorrow or the next day.
9327226	9329667	Do I have a justifiable reason for not wanting to drive now?
9330047	9332368	Fuck cage match, too, and I want a copy of Geek now.
9335290	9340852	Legend of Zaku says F you to the Iraqi insurgent who capped one of my school's student soldier to death last Sunday.
9341252	9343834	And F you to President Bush for making that situation possible.
9344374	9348255	F you to all the thunderstorms we've been having tonight, thus taking out the power in my house for a little bit.
9348595	9354658	And F you to my cable provider, Cablevision, for providing shitty digital cable that gives me channels with piss-poor lag and pixelation.
9356598	9362562	Tomokun says, fuck my iTunes library for corrupting itself and all but one song not recovering.
9362882	9364583	The acapella to Feel Good Inc.
9364703	9365804	was the song that got saved.
9366944	9367445	You saved it?
9367665	9368425	Send it to me, please.
9369926	9375629	Chimera says, F you to not having enough money to buy cool stuff like ATHF DVDs and Napalm.
9377651	9382974	Socorina says, F you to Jack Thompson for being the biggest fucktard on Earth and causing havoc worldwide.
9385765	9388989	Dark Knight says, my FU goes to my job for driving me insane.
9389029	9391352	Another to being broke, and finally to gas prices.
9391392	9392894	This has gone too damn far!
9396089	9400332	Dirty Thief says, F you to my damn boss for giving me six extra hours of work.
9400813	9406958	F you to traffic, thunderstorms, and other shit that ruins my Sunday night, including these damn electronic shit.
9407618	9411221	And F you to damn wet streets merely making me hit a poor dog.
9411301	9411802	Fuck that.
9412262	9415204	My friend almost hit a cat the other night when we were driving in Pennsylvania.
9415224	9417786	Oh, it was the saddest thing ever, and he almost had a heart attack.
9418127	9419288	Don't hit animals on the road.
9420148	9421069	Didn't try hard enough.
9421840	9423761	DarkTetsuya says, Amen to Loki.
9423841	9425482	Fuck you to Jack Thompson.
9425803	9427283	Surely you have something better to do?
9430525	9433848	Oh, and Tomokun says, No, the one that didn't get saved.
9433988	9434608	I screwed up.
9435288	9436169	Oh, so Feel Good Inc.
9436249	9437370	Acapella didn't get saved.
9437490	9439791	I'm being assisted with that, and I will be happy to share.
9440212	9440712	Oh, good.
9442033	9446876	Misty says, Yes, I know that I'm still getting off easy right now, but I still wanted to bitch about it.
9446916	9447916	Well, okay, fair enough.
9448337	9450318	That's what you get to do here on this show, so...
9451383	9452384	That was the FUs of the week!
9454324	9454945	Hope you enjoyed.
9455545	9465830	We... So, DarkSakura, I understand we have some guest listeners tonight, or some folks listening, a pretty large contingent from some sites?
9466050	9471493	A few of the people from the Gorillas Unofficial chat's listening in, so hi guys, thank you for listening in.
9471713	9478016	We have Bexar and Roz, and I'm trying to remember who else was listening, but if I don't remember, hi!
9478709	9479770	You get a big shout out from me.
9479910	9480971	We like it when new people listen.
9481511	9487776	I'm going to tip the Orange Lounge hat by just giving a little nod with a song here.
9490437	9493720	We'll dance like they do in the iPod commercials here with the shadows and everything.
9493740	9496021	I'd rather not dance like they do in the iPod commercials.
9497062	9501085	You can just keep playing this for me.
9501185	9501886	Okay, that's all you get.
9501926	9502126	Sorry.
9506401	9507121	You know what, though?
9507161	9508562	That makes me think of this.
9508682	9512125	I was randomly having lunch in Phoenix yesterday, right?
9512405	9517389	Jason took me to this Chinese restaurant, and we were watching commercials on TV.
9517729	9523353	And I saw this one that looked like it was parading that commercial with the feel-good ink and the...
9523733	9525135	iPod Shadow Dancers, right?
9525655	9527897	But it was children doing the shadow dancing.
9528197	9529499	And we were like, what the hell is this?
9530139	9533583	And it turns out it was actually for like a Kidz Bop CD.
9533643	9534423	But no, it gets better.
9534824	9539748	It was actually an all-Christian Kidz Bop version.
9539949	9541010	I don't remember what it was called.
9541050	9544153	It was like, wow, that's inspiration or something like that.
9544173	9545634	Kidz Inspiration or something.
9545694	9548737	It was Kidz Bop, but
9549321	9555683	all God music and she was telling you to copy or take to a copyright infringement.
9555703	9560884	Yes, I thought Thou Shalt Not Steal was one of the Thou Shalt Not Steal copyrights.
9561804	9565105	You know, we need to actually check the original translation to see what that says.
9566005	9573327	Actually, point of order, in case you didn't know, the original translation for Thou Shalt Not Kill is actually Thou Shalt Not Commit Murder.
9576328	9576748	Interesting.
9577028	9577248	Yes.
9577868	9578048	See,
9579321	9581242	I love how much crap they changed.
9582462	9585043	You know you're opening a whole can of worms when you bring up religion.
9585103	9587243	I'm not going to open up the religion can of worms.
9587583	9590504	My God, I mean, we get hate mail when Loki bashes on Max.
9590904	9592024	We don't want to get religion.
9592645	9593125	And you know what?
9593205	9595005	I usually forward all that over to his email.
9595045	9595405	Oh, good.
9596186	9597326	I don't get any hate mail.
9598186	9600367	Exactly, although I did share the funny Mac one with you.
9601127	9602447	Yeah, well, whatever.
9603508	9604348	That one was stupid.
9604768	9605068	All right.
9605694	9607414	We're going to go to a quick break, boys and girls.
9607454	9610715	When we come back, we're going to do a little bit of Ask Orange Lounge.
9610775	9617196	And, you know, I just came back from a trip, and we were kind of off last week, except for, well, you know, there was the music show going on.
9617256	9620917	But, you know, we haven't had a chance to do some Ask Orange Lounge in a little while.
9621017	9624858	So here's your chance to ask us something, anything you want.
9625538	9628158	So we're going to go just to some more music potpourri.
9628278	9631659	I'll probably do another In the Groove song this break for you folks that are into that.
9633672	9647125	and I know there's a lot of folks out there that are into this song and we haven't played it in a long time so like it or not, here's some Cartoon Heroes we'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio and Ask Orange Lounge so send your questions in to Sky be a private message
9765824	9766466	Thanks for watching!
9841641	9843066	Thanks for watching!
9891734	9892276	and more.
10025968	10026969	I just made that connection.
10027409	10032633	I think the guy wanted to hear the Romeo and Juliet song from In the Groove, and I played that one instead.
10035315	10035715	Whoops!
10037056	10038117	Boy, did I fuck that one up.
10040538	10045841	Rob messed up, Rob messed up, la la, la la, la la, la la
10067458	10069279	Max Unlimited in that break, too.
10071240	10072541	Is it Minimalian or Minimalian?
10072621	10073601	I think it's Minimalian.
10073681	10074942	Minimalian.
10075202	10076223	Yeah.
10076323	10076963	Mini-something.
10077123	10077643	Mini-something.
10077923	10079104	And then Romeo and Juliet.
10079124	10079544	By who?
10079704	10080425	By Lolita.
10081585	10082866	You never said who Minimalian was.
10083006	10084187	Oh, Detroitian.
10084547	10085427	No, Detroitian.
10085547	10086248	Detroitian.
10086648	10087248	Detroitian.
10087308	10088249	That's just a cool name.
10089349	10092471	Here's that little clip of the other Romeo and Juliet song.
10099773	10102094	You know, I actually do like this Romeo and Juliet better, too.
10102154	10103635	Why didn't I think of this at first?
10103735	10104035	I don't know.
10106076	10108017	I'm just in a para mode tonight or something.
10108397	10108857	I don't know.
10110098	10111178	I can't believe I did that.
10112039	10117401	Next time, kids, specify the artist if there's more than one song by the name or I might fuck your request up.
10123244	10125765	I bet that guy's not happy, though, whose request I fucked up.
10125805	10127986	But, you know, I'm human.
10128006	10128506	What can I say?
10129236	10129977	Yeah, the other one.
10129997	10131998	It was Tomokun requested it.
10132198	10132638	I know.
10132759	10133739	I'm sorry, Tomokun.
10133819	10136801	And he specifically spelled it a different way.
10137041	10139123	It didn't click for me at first.
10139183	10139463	I'm sorry.
10139503	10141344	Rob doesn't care about our listeners.
10141404	10141905	You know what?
10141925	10142625	You found me out.
10142645	10145507	Just because in the groove is forgettable, that's all.
10146628	10151011	I was waiting for Loki to jump in there with some slamming in the groove comment.
10151651	10153012	You snubbed my fanboy.
10153032	10154173	I'm sorry.
10154193	10154673	I'm sorry.
10155699	10158200	I may have snubbed your fanboy, but I didn't snub your stalker.
10158260	10159740	I've been reading DDR Freak lately.
10159900	10161681	Okay, my stalker is scary.
10162561	10163441	Oh, my God.
10163742	10164362	Oh, my God.
10164482	10165442	No, no, no, no, no, no.
10165842	10167563	This Blair is King guy.
10167943	10168263	Yeah.
10168323	10172604	DarkSakura, I watched you leave in your car today.
10173825	10177286	You going to lock another thread today?
10177306	10183167	I mean, I really do want to thank... Iguana Girl is my best friend.
10184048	10184968	And, you know, she will...
10185885	10186445	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10216344	10217065	Fanboy is cool.
10217645	10218847	Creepy Stalker is not cool.
10218887	10223511	He sends me private messages saying, you should probably warn this person.
10223551	10224832	You should probably warn this person.
10224852	10225733	You should watch this thread.
10226013	10229456	I send those to Iguana Girl and sometimes you, and I'm not stalking you guys.
10229717	10234721	I know, but he's like all the time doing it, and I'm like, oh my god, you're a freak.
10235982	10237043	He might be listening.
10237103	10239726	This poor guy's probably listening, and you're breaking his heart.
10239746	10240226	I hope so.
10240246	10241067	You're breaking his heart.
10241545	10243927	I'm giving him a solid dose of reality.
10244067	10244548	It's good.
10244568	10245389	Good for the soul.
10245589	10249372	Yeah, it actually does sound kind of like he's trying to kiss my ass.
10249392	10250873	He just wants to be a mod.
10250913	10251854	Is that so wrong?
10251914	10253796	Isn't that what all the kids want?
10253836	10254857	He wants to be a mod.
10256395	10259797	Being a moderator on DDR Freak is not all roses and sunshine.
10259817	10260917	So he can get closer to you.
10262217	10264398	Don't say stuff like that!
10264418	10265479	You're freaking me out!
10265739	10273862	Doesn't he know that the mods on DDR Freak are appointed by God and you can't obviously become one unless you have a miracle?
10274162	10276463	Actually, if you want to know, we sort of vote on you, moderators.
10276843	10278544	You have to have three miracles.
10280885	10283366	And then after that we part the Dead Sea and...
10285788	10289851	You know, spitnails, shit ice cream, that type of thing.
10289871	10290271	Fuck no!
10317628	10318849	I'm proud of myself for that one.
10319709	10320350	I made that up.
10322411	10323691	I should be on Whose Line Is It Anyway?
10323751	10326313	Rene has two queries, one for Loki.
10326493	10327353	He said queries.
10327894	10328614	One for Loki.
10329034	10334778	Since he's playing Star Soldier, does that freaky face that becomes whole mid-level boss still appear in the game?
10335598	10338159	Yep, every single level almost.
10340501	10340961	That's that.
10342272	10353760	Rene says, and one for anybody who has played at E3, I heard that the E3 demo for We Heart Katamari was exclusive for E3.
10354120	10355721	It was, he even talks to you.
10355941	10357182	What was so exclusive about it?
10357402	10364086	He actually said that, yeah, there's this convention with all these people playing this to see my beautiful presence or something.
10364687	10367489	So it's actually talking about people being at E3.
10368109	10390076	Yeah, it actually, in the text, it actually talks about, like, oh, we hope you enjoy this E3 demo, you know, and, like, I just remember the E3 was referenced in the King of Cosmos dialogue, and it's kind of too bad that that dialogue will probably never see the light of day in the real world, because it was that same, like, funny writing, quirky writing, that makes Katamari Damacy so special.
10390437	10391717	So that was pretty much what it was.
10395578	10397659	That game got delayed till September as well.
10398462	10398822	Don't!
10400763	10407546	I'll just say, hey Bradley, you live like, what, five minutes from my house, why don't you come over and, oh yeah, bring Katamari too, you can bring it.
10407686	10410167	I have an HD loader and HDL dump, you know.
10411027	10414849	You'll have to come over and show me how to get that set up, by the way.
10415169	10418570	I have We Love Katamari on an unmodded US PlayStation 2.
10418970	10425073	If I get a US, if I get the old style PlayStation on a hard drive, can I still get HD loader somehow?
10425553	10427654	Yeah, there are free versions that are available still.
10427898	10429100	for your memory card.
10429140	10433067	And you can even run homebrew stuff and all that wonderful stuff without a mod chip.
10433347	10433688	Good to hear.
10434329	10437595	Socorino wants to know, what does Loki think about stuffed penises?
10438536	10439378	That's the question.
10441941	10443021	Look at the monitor yourself.
10443061	10443442	There it is.
10443702	10447605	Well, honestly, we were going to get Rob an inflatable penis.
10448025	10450908	And to surprise him, we found it at the adult store.
10450928	10451829	Detachable penis.
10452189	10458714	That was at... We went to... We actually went to Gold Club Centerfolds with Rob's roommate and my fiance.
10458754	10462277	Oh, speaking of Rob's roommate, here comes Extifer right now.
10462917	10465520	And so my fiance, she got a lap dance.
10466080	10468362	And the stripper licked her boob.
10468822	10471084	And then... Well, she was...
10472565	10485230	I personally had to pay for all three of us, so that was a $150 adventure, in which I got no lap dance and no boobs rubbed in my face, and the cheesesteaks were fucking awful!
10485550	10486711	What the hell happened?
10486931	10491333	Lap dance is always better when the stripper is crying.
10492053	10492373	Yes.
10492693	10493174	Gay man.
10493894	10494154	Uh-huh.
10494214	10495015	Stripper club.
10496355	10496855	What the hell?
10497456	10500177	Actually, I used to go all the time, too, so I put...
10501335	10502776	Your first experience, how was it?
10503096	10503937	It was great.
10504917	10505898	There were strippers.
10506638	10510280	Can I say... You can say whatever you want on the internet.
10510600	10511041	Oh, I can?
10511121	10511401	Okay.
10511841	10513162	I saw a lot of pussy.
10514442	10516664	And I saw a lot of ass.
10517784	10522447	And actually, Loki's girlfriend pointed out to me that they bleach their assholes.
10523428	10525088	And like, they really do.
10526789	10528430	Like, they seriously do.
10529011	10529211	Like...
10530225	10531386	It's like regular skin.
10531406	10533488	The bigger life of strippers.
10533728	10534049	Yeah.
10535890	10539714	And, um, so yeah, a lot of pussy, a lot of ass, a lot of boobs.
10540434	10542416	But I didn't get boobs rubbed in my face either.
10542436	10543137	Me neither.
10543697	10546760	I'm telling you, okay, all three of us were sitting at the goddamn rail.
10546940	10549402	I was tipping for all three of us because I had to.
10549983	10554087	And, um, who gets the boobs rubbed in their face but my goddamn fiancé?
10554667	10556689	You know, as it should be.
10557722	10565449	I think what we need to do is we need to crop just that little portion of the show right there and have that be the four-year consideration clip for next year's Life 365 Awards.
10565809	10569653	Just expert going, and some strippers bleach their assholes!
10571955	10573536	Orange Lounge Radio, Video Game Radio.
10575058	10579522	We like video games and stripper chat.
10582845	10583225	You know...
10585512	10590420	Hi, we're degenerating into bleached asshole chat.
10590480	10592824	You know, I am almost getting... Which is better than...
10594930	10603453	I think you just made some of your fans... I think we should honestly use that as a segue to DarkSakura's tip of the week, you know, thing.
10603733	10611016	You know, if we talked about video games all the time, we wouldn't have time to talk about strippers bleaching their assholes.
10611036	10618138	Oh my god, it's actually funny, one of our listeners in the girl's chat says she's heard about it.
10618158	10619799	Oh my god.
10620731	10623033	Bleached Asshole Chat That's it, that's it.
10623153	10627736	From now on we no longer have Paris Hilton Chat, we have Bleached Asshole Chat.
10627797	10628477	Same difference.
10628517	10629478	I want to go next time too.
10629498	10630379	I got boobs in my face.
10630519	10632000	I got boobs in my face last time.
10632020	10632660	Strippers love gay men.
10646567	10650410	Now that my ass has broadband, I need some cool things to do besides look at Prawn and the like.
10674031	10677055	Some suggestions for Zaku now that he's upgraded to broadband.

10683223	10684144	Subscribe!
10684685	10686567	Go into iTunes and search for OrangeLight.
10687448	10689271	Did you know we're featured on iTunes this week?
10689311	10689611	Did you?
10690092	10690833	Did I mention that?
10693451	10696712	And then get BitTorrent and download a bunch of Sentai TV.
10697832	10703654	I was going to suggest online gaming, now that you don't have to develop.
10703994	10704914	Get into some online games.
10705074	10708555	Oh my god, you can play Free Ragnarok with me if I can ever get KRO to work.
10709896	10711476	Try some online games.
10712236	10713036	Play PSO with me.
10713056	10717458	I'm wondering when I'm going to actually get back to playing Final Fantasy XI.
10717518	10719178	All these console games distract me.
10720594	10727596	Tomo-kun wants to know, why did my brother get a text message at 5am from his job's assistant manager about his penis size?
10728396	10728676	Drunk.
10731716	10732017	Gay?
10732337	10732717	I don't know.
10733717	10734397	Probably not gay.
10736137	10738618	American penis so big!
10740018	10746640	Perhaps he had inquired about his penis size earlier today, and his boss just finally got him around to getting that.
10746680	10748600	Maybe you didn't hear the whole story.
10749366	10750235	Maybe that's what's going on.
10754816	10761481	MJSI24 wants to know, I listen to the podcast mostly, as I can't listen to the live show usually.
10761541	10767245	Hey, you and about a thousand other people, by the way, in comparing the ratings from a podcast to the live show.
10767926	10770067	But I'm wondering when you record the podcast.
10770087	10775031	What are you planning on talking about this week, and what day will it officially be posted to iTunes for download?
10775711	10781936	We record our podcast, believe it or not, immediately after we do this show, which is why if we ever sound a little worn out or
10782301	10783502	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10808716	10811217	So another fun parents are ignorant discussion.
10811257	10812057	Should be a good time.
10812837	10815498	What day will it officially be posted to iTunes to download?
10816178	10816858	It should show up.
10817078	10820919	It usually gets posted right after midnight Pacific time.
10821780	10823180	So early, early Monday morning.
10823240	10824380	They're supposed to roll out on Mondays.
10824660	10826721	So when you wake up Monday morning, it should be there.
10827141	10830362	If not, we had some type of internal problem and we'll get it up as soon as we can.
10830582	10833623	So that should answer that.
10836277	10840019	Tomokun wants to clarify he was talking about his own cock, as he put it.
10841560	10843762	Not Tomokun, but anyway, forget it.
10846704	10847084	I don't know.
10849165	10849385	Yeah.
10850266	10850846	I think that was it.
10850886	10851927	That was pretty much all the questions we had.
10851947	10852207	Oh, okay.
10852427	10853648	I thought we might have had one more.
10855930	10856590	Did I lose it?
10856650	10857110	What did I do?
10857190	10858291	Did I accidentally close the window?
10858892	10860433	Do we have any emails?
10862374	10865636	Our emails were all for... Yeah, all the emails we get are the podcast.
10867500	10868221	No one loves us.
10868521	10872284	Remember, a thousand more people listen to the podcast than listen to this show.
10873985	10874585	But that's okay.
10875546	10877087	So we do this show because we love you guys.
10877367	10877607	Really.
10877747	10880609	This is just a labor of love now because we're certainly not getting the ratings.
10881910	10883732	It smells like fresh podcast in here.
10885173	10886494	Are you talking about my podcast?
10887014	10887554	Maybe.
10890116	10891257	That will never get old.
10893779	10894359	Never, never, never.
10894819	10895500	Ever, ever, ever.
10896872	10897152	All right.
10898512	10901433	I guess what we'll do now is end the show.
10905394	10906754	What's so funny, Extifer?
10908234	10910014	Well, because we're done.
10910054	10914435	It's 9.29, and by the time we get our final thoughts out and everything, it'll be 9.30, and that's a done show.
10914495	10917456	And I'm sure the fortune cookie is probably another five minutes, so we're running over anyway.
10918336	10918736	So whatever.
10918796	10919176	Who cares?
10919216	10919516	We're done.
10921296	10921797	You want more?
10921877	10922657	Tune in next week.
10922697	10923177	You want more?

10923477	10924377	Tune in to the podcast.
10926141	10927081	Final thoughts, boys and girls.
10927162	10928682	Loki, or Extifer, you're in the room.
10928742	10929503	Why don't you start us off?
10930843	10931504	Loke Extifer.
10931644	10933605	Extifer, what is your final thought?
10933885	10936006	I'm in the groove.
10937867	10939147	Wait a minute, I said Extifer.
10940468	10942129	Loki, what's your final thought?
10943229	10951654	My final thought is I have to play a lot more console games this week, and strippers really do bleach their assholes.
10952054	10952434	Thank you.
10953330	10954111	DarkSakura.
10954131	10955472	Actually, I'll give you my final thought.
10955492	10958574	My final thought is I'm sweating.
10958614	10960095	It's hot in here and not in the good way.
10960736	10961196	DarkSakura.
10962717	10963818	What do I say every show?
10965659	10966820	Reject false bleach.
10967340	10968781	Yeah, reject false assholes.
10969121	10970563	Bleach next time.
10977236	10978237	You heard it here first.
10978317	10979558	Reject false assholes.
10980338	10981559	Only good for real.
10981579	10982780	100% organic asshole.
10983221	10987624	Organically colored assholes.
10988685	10993228	We are ending this show now before this joke goes on a little too far.
10993368	10993789	Too late.

11001455	11004757	I'll give it to Eksta for one word to sum the whole thing up.
11005718	11005838	Ass.
11007133	11010155	And now, here is your fortune cookie message of the day.
11046703	11052928	I'm in love with an electric man An android Adonis with a yellow tan

11083448	11109251	There's something about a positronic man The touch and the feel of his plastic hands I go wild when I see his eyes Of gold and a glowing from inside Oh robo lover won't you kiss me please Your tongue has never failed to stimulate me Oh wham bam a thank you man
11112674	11138541	Electric Man You know he's fully functional, I tell ya You know he's fully functional, I'm sayin' You know he's fully functional And if he ever gets too hot, well I can always switch him off Oh baby, oh
