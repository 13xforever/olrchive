34
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:45,337
[SPEAKER_04]: So she may drop by at the end of the show because she wants to be here for the podcast to fill us in on Classic Gaming Expo.

35
00:03:45,357 --> 00:03:46,498
[SPEAKER_04]: But she won't be here for a little bit.

36
00:03:46,978 --> 00:03:51,741
[SPEAKER_04]: So filling in, we have the one and only, since he's sitting in the fluffy green chair, I'm saying he's filling in.

37
00:03:52,421 --> 00:03:54,703
[SPEAKER_04]: The one and only Miklatov, say hello.

38
00:03:56,328 --> 00:03:58,669
[SPEAKER_04]: Pause, Meteos, and say hello.

39
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:01,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Turn the mic on.

40
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:01,690
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

41
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:03,731
[SPEAKER_04]: It hasn't been that long since you've been here, has it?

42
00:04:04,391 --> 00:04:04,951
[SPEAKER_04]: A couple of months.

43
00:04:05,172 --> 00:04:05,712
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, a little while.

44
00:04:06,352 --> 00:04:11,734
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so I'm sure he'll be telling us a whole lot of nothing tonight because all those stupid NDAs.

45
00:04:11,814 --> 00:04:13,835
[SPEAKER_04]: So why do we even have you on this show?

46
00:04:13,855 --> 00:04:14,955
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't remember.

47
00:04:16,616 --> 00:04:17,857
[SPEAKER_24]: Because I get drunk a lot.

48
00:04:18,077 --> 00:04:18,357
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

49
00:04:18,377 --> 00:04:18,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, not tonight.

50
00:04:18,997 --> 00:04:20,117
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, what's the point?

51
00:04:20,157 --> 00:04:23,399
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, after all, you know, GamePro is just breaking all this news.

52
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:23,919
[SPEAKER_02]: What's wrong?

53
00:04:24,904 --> 00:04:27,885
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't get in trouble for spilling the stuff that they're not supposed to be.

54
00:04:28,045 --> 00:04:28,945
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't sign anything.

55
00:04:28,965 --> 00:04:34,126
[SPEAKER_03]: But GamePro's crappy, so they don't know that it's GamePro.

56
00:04:34,226 --> 00:04:37,687
[SPEAKER_04]: The one voice over there you hear is the one and only Techmaster Loki.

57
00:04:38,547 --> 00:04:40,428
[SPEAKER_02]: I am here, and I love bacon.

58
00:04:41,028 --> 00:04:41,448
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, you do.

59
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:42,388
[SPEAKER_02]: You do love bacon.

60
00:04:42,968 --> 00:04:43,348
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

61
00:04:43,748 --> 00:04:47,529
[SPEAKER_04]: Also joining us tonight, we have other special guests, not just those folks.

62
00:04:47,589 --> 00:04:49,930
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got the one and only Jazz.

63
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:51,230
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.

64
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:51,970
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you?

65
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:52,891
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, that mic's loud.

66
00:04:53,151 --> 00:04:53,631
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all right.

67
00:04:53,991 --> 00:04:54,371
[SPEAKER_15]: No, my voice.

68
00:04:54,773 --> 00:04:55,153
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

69
00:04:56,134 --> 00:04:56,675
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm fine.

70
00:04:57,716 --> 00:04:58,116
[SPEAKER_04]: Good to hear.

71
00:04:58,997 --> 00:04:59,317
[SPEAKER_24]: Alright.

72
00:04:59,597 --> 00:05:07,164
[SPEAKER_04]: Say hello also to the one and only, the guy who turned this show NC-17 last week with a single sentence.

73
00:05:07,645 --> 00:05:09,747
[SPEAKER_04]: Say hello to my roommate, Extifer.

74
00:05:09,947 --> 00:05:10,508
[SPEAKER_24]: Yo.

75
00:05:11,328 --> 00:05:11,689
[SPEAKER_24]: Alright.

76
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:17,474
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so we're going to take a quick break and then we're going to come back and dish for a little bit.

77
00:05:18,103 --> 00:05:19,224
[SPEAKER_04]: And all the times I knew we ever would've

78
00:05:47,429 --> 00:05:49,312
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for watching!

79
00:08:39,998 --> 00:09:09,357
[SPEAKER_15]: How come you just walk away from me When all I can do is watch you leave Cause we've shared the laughter and the pain And even shared the tears You're the only one who really knew me at all So take a look at me now Cause you're just an empty

80
00:09:14,452 --> 00:09:15,393
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for watching!

81
00:09:44,207 --> 00:09:48,833
[SPEAKER_15]: There's just a lefty thing And there's nothing left here to remind

82
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:18,249
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go

83
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,303
Thank you for watching!

84
00:11:39,631 --> 00:11:42,333
[SPEAKER_00]: Go left, go right, go left, go left, go left, go left

85
00:12:08,749 --> 00:12:09,109
[SPEAKER_04]: Music Gaming

86
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:33,468
[SPEAKER_02]: MusicBaseVideoGames.com

87
00:12:54,656 --> 00:12:56,177
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

88
00:13:23,047 --> 00:13:49,192
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to play some more games, um, Darkwatch, for, you know, briefly, then I got bored of Darkwatch after about five minutes, just because, you know, first person shooters, eh, I just didn't have the time to dedicate to it, so Burnout 3 it was, because I took down 54 cars in one match, and that was fucking awesome, that was one of the best races I've done, uh, it was just like, I was in the zone, just like, knocking off cars, you know, three at a time, and

89
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:53,894
[SPEAKER_04]: You have been obsessed with Burnout 3, just like I have been obsessed with Meteos.

90
00:13:54,094 --> 00:13:54,774
[SPEAKER_04]: I cannot stop.

91
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:57,296
[SPEAKER_04]: And now, Miklatov is obsessed with Meteos.

92
00:13:57,757 --> 00:14:00,139
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, then also, I got to play actual music games.

93
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:03,822
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to play Taiko no Tachigen while I was waiting for Nelly to get out of the doctor's.

94
00:14:07,181 --> 00:14:28,152
[SPEAKER_02]: On the PSP, you didn't lug the big drum into the doctor's office or anything I do lug my PS2 around though, I do do that And I kid you not, this is how addicted to Burnout 3 I am I will lug my PS2, I carry it with me to work I'll lug it downstairs, we'll hook it up to the TV We'll play two races and unhook it up in a matter of 15 minutes

95
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:32,134
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty much all I did that was super exciting.

96
00:14:32,174 --> 00:14:33,114
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw a 40 year old virgin in that movie.

97
00:14:33,134 --> 00:14:33,695
[SPEAKER_02]: It was hilarious.

98
00:14:53,106 --> 00:14:54,006
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.

99
00:14:54,046 --> 00:14:54,687
[SPEAKER_02]: Highly recommend it.

100
00:14:54,747 --> 00:14:56,488
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it funnier than There's Something About Mary?

101
00:14:56,508 --> 00:14:56,988
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

102
00:14:57,548 --> 00:15:00,189
[SPEAKER_02]: It was one of those movies you actually laugh out loud.

103
00:15:00,249 --> 00:15:01,550
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just really funny.

104
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:06,112
[SPEAKER_02]: Steve Carell is awesome, and all the supporting cast was awesome as well.

105
00:15:06,172 --> 00:15:07,553
[SPEAKER_02]: So, really good movie.

106
00:15:08,013 --> 00:15:08,953
[SPEAKER_04]: Comment from the chat room.

107
00:15:09,013 --> 00:15:14,276
[SPEAKER_04]: Fireboma says, Any game that enables you to produce Final Destination 2 pileups are great.

108
00:15:15,736 --> 00:15:17,417
[SPEAKER_10]: If you remember the beginning of that movie.

109
00:15:17,997 --> 00:15:19,138
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to join our chat...

110
00:15:19,693 --> 00:15:21,674
[SPEAKER_04]: and have comments randomly read on air.

111
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:23,396
[SPEAKER_04]: OrangeLoungeRadio.com, click on chat.

112
00:15:23,816 --> 00:15:27,118
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the difference between this show and the podcast, really, is that you get to interact with us.

113
00:15:27,198 --> 00:15:30,241
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing that pisses me off about Burnout 3, though, is I can't find cheat codes for it.

114
00:15:30,501 --> 00:15:34,104
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it being on my hard drive, it makes it a little hard to cheat.

115
00:15:34,164 --> 00:15:39,407
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a way, though, Code Breaker version 9, I guess you can do that, but I have 8, so I have to see if I can upgrade that or something.

116
00:15:39,427 --> 00:15:39,788
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

117
00:15:40,348 --> 00:15:47,053
[SPEAKER_02]: But, yeah, it looks like it's going to be really fun, and I'm waiting for Burnout Revenge, because that's next month, so...

118
00:15:47,912 --> 00:15:48,492
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

119
00:16:08,277 --> 00:16:12,020
[SPEAKER_02]: College DJ, okay, that's on MTV, okay?

120
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,921
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I got my start.

121
00:16:15,102 --> 00:16:20,545
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, you're listening to Chico State Radio, and now it's some Beck, and coming up, more Beck!

122
00:16:22,307 --> 00:16:28,791
[SPEAKER_02]: No, honestly, it's very annoying, and I've turned the announcer off a few times, and he keeps coming back.

123
00:16:29,506 --> 00:16:39,014
[SPEAKER_02]: and also if you don't play the world race mode right off the bat, you'll keep getting these stupid training videos that pop up and they're like five minutes long and you can't bypass any of them.

124
00:16:39,094 --> 00:16:40,095
[SPEAKER_02]: That sucks.

125
00:16:41,697 --> 00:16:47,462
[SPEAKER_02]: And also some of the physics in the game were a little touchy and the AI is a bit too rubber bandy and it's just, I don't know.

126
00:16:47,622 --> 00:16:51,845
[SPEAKER_02]: But Burnout Revenge, from what I hear, fixes all of that and the game is amazing.

127
00:16:51,865 --> 00:16:52,966
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't wait.

128
00:16:52,986 --> 00:16:55,649
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you can also do, I guess...

129
00:16:56,793 --> 00:16:58,193
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

130
00:17:28,188 --> 00:17:28,809
[SPEAKER_07]: That's about it.

131
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:31,191
[SPEAKER_07]: That was my life.

132
00:17:31,251 --> 00:17:31,811
[SPEAKER_07]: And I worked.

133
00:17:32,192 --> 00:17:33,433
[SPEAKER_07]: You worked a lot this week?

134
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:34,774
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, and I hated it.

135
00:17:35,094 --> 00:17:36,135
[SPEAKER_07]: I hated it so much.

136
00:17:36,215 --> 00:17:37,796
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't talk about you don't like it.

137
00:17:39,098 --> 00:17:42,821
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't say that when Konami people might be listening to this show, you dumbass.

138
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:44,551
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

139
00:18:06,532 --> 00:18:10,476
[SPEAKER_02]: Based off the original Frogger, and well, it's a Frogger game.

140
00:18:10,836 --> 00:18:14,160
[SPEAKER_07]: If you can take care of Hawaii, it's all Hawaii.

141
00:18:15,361 --> 00:18:17,142
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's just go to Hawaii and beat some people up.

142
00:18:17,182 --> 00:18:18,624
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I mean, it's that simple.

143
00:18:18,884 --> 00:18:22,187
[SPEAKER_07]: Japan needs to, you know, bomb them again.

144
00:18:22,427 --> 00:18:25,090
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, for those that don't know Miku Latavi, he actually works at Konami.

145
00:18:25,951 --> 00:18:26,191
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you

146
00:18:26,867 --> 00:18:28,148
[SPEAKER_04]: What can you tell us about your job?

147
00:18:28,188 --> 00:18:34,432
[SPEAKER_04]: He's under a lot of non-disclosure agreements, which means if he says things that he's not supposed to, he gets a spanking and possibly fired.

148
00:18:34,452 --> 00:18:37,814
[SPEAKER_02]: They should put a little collar around his neck if he says something he's not supposed to.

149
00:18:37,834 --> 00:18:39,795
[SPEAKER_04]: That transmits back to the home planet.

150
00:18:40,956 --> 00:18:42,156
[SPEAKER_04]: So what can you say about your job?

151
00:18:42,176 --> 00:18:44,217
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, okay, people know I do DDR.

152
00:18:44,718 --> 00:18:49,721
[SPEAKER_07]: And, I mean, if you look at instruction booklets, you see lists of testers and stuff.

153
00:18:49,921 --> 00:18:51,562
[SPEAKER_07]: And so you see my name there, too.

154
00:18:51,662 --> 00:18:53,623
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, you can gather that information.

155
00:18:53,803 --> 00:18:56,025
[SPEAKER_07]: I test and I do DDR and I do other things.

156
00:18:56,265 --> 00:18:59,488
[SPEAKER_04]: So would it be fair to say and feel free to say you can't answer if you can't?

157
00:18:59,508 --> 00:19:00,269
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't answer that what?

158
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:02,191
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't even ask!

159
00:19:03,152 --> 00:19:04,853
[SPEAKER_04]: Is DDR the only game you work on?

160
00:19:05,274 --> 00:19:05,414
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

161
00:19:05,434 --> 00:19:05,935
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's not.

162
00:19:06,335 --> 00:19:07,356
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

163
00:19:07,496 --> 00:19:09,298
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you work on games other than Bomani games?

164
00:19:09,518 --> 00:19:09,738
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

165
00:19:10,219 --> 00:19:10,379
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

166
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:10,519
[SPEAKER_07]: I see.

167
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:11,620
[SPEAKER_04]: I see.

168
00:19:12,185 --> 00:19:13,186
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

169
00:19:28,913 --> 00:19:29,173
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

170
00:19:29,893 --> 00:19:33,674
[SPEAKER_04]: Any songs from any purple-looking games that you can think of?

171
00:19:33,734 --> 00:19:35,935
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you're talking about Beatmania, aren't you?

172
00:19:35,995 --> 00:19:36,355
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

173
00:19:36,515 --> 00:19:37,335
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, hold on.

174
00:19:37,475 --> 00:19:38,235
[SPEAKER_07]: I can clear this up.

175
00:19:38,775 --> 00:19:39,736
[SPEAKER_07]: You know about Beatmania?

176
00:19:40,316 --> 00:19:42,696
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't know anything more than everybody else does.

177
00:19:42,796 --> 00:19:47,197
[SPEAKER_07]: When we saw those pictures for the first time is when you saw those pictures for the first time.

178
00:19:47,717 --> 00:19:49,178
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was shocking to us, too.

179
00:19:49,218 --> 00:19:51,198
[SPEAKER_03]: But IGN saw them before everybody saw them.

180
00:19:51,218 --> 00:19:51,978
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, they're jerks.

181
00:19:54,099 --> 00:19:54,779
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate IGN.

182
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:57,266
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up?

183
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:58,328
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you tell me about this?

184
00:19:58,568 --> 00:19:59,909
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell's up with GamePro?

185
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:00,830
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell?

186
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:02,612
[SPEAKER_03]: How come they beat you to everything?

187
00:20:02,772 --> 00:20:08,178
[SPEAKER_07]: They're a nobody, like, pays attention to magazine, so they can say whatever they want.

188
00:20:08,979 --> 00:20:12,583
[SPEAKER_07]: They need to say something to get some readers, and then they have readers for a day.

189
00:20:12,703 --> 00:20:13,483
[SPEAKER_04]: Disclaimer, guys.

190
00:20:13,684 --> 00:20:16,847
[SPEAKER_04]: Miklatov's comments are his own, and do not necessarily reflect those of Konami.

191
00:20:16,867 --> 00:20:18,369
[SPEAKER_02]: They are wannabe EGM, okay?

192
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:25,053
[SPEAKER_02]: GamePro used to be the shit back in the day when it was GamePro and Nintendo Power.

193
00:20:37,655 --> 00:20:41,959
[SPEAKER_02]: Every day they would walk in and see the big list of the club members and go, Ha ha ha ha ha!

194
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:43,800
[SPEAKER_02]: Stupid people!

195
00:20:45,621 --> 00:20:54,528
[SPEAKER_07]: See, the only thing I remember from GamePro from my childhood is the two covers, the American Gladiators one, and the Gremlins 2 one, and then everything else is a blur.

196
00:20:54,749 --> 00:20:56,470
[SPEAKER_07]: Because the American Gladiators one.

197
00:20:58,939 --> 00:20:59,959
[SPEAKER_06]: What's that noise?

198
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:00,800
[SPEAKER_06]: Forget it.

199
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:06,882
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't remember when I pinched my cheek at the cover.

200
00:21:07,162 --> 00:21:07,762
[SPEAKER_03]: Forget it.

201
00:21:08,563 --> 00:21:09,683
[SPEAKER_03]: Forget it.

202
00:21:09,903 --> 00:21:11,444
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob was trying to save it.

203
00:21:11,524 --> 00:21:13,264
[SPEAKER_03]: He was masturbating to the cover.

204
00:21:13,324 --> 00:21:14,825
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, when I was nine.

205
00:21:15,985 --> 00:21:21,107
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what we call a radio gag because they can't see that I'm pulling my cheek.

206
00:21:21,567 --> 00:21:24,268
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds over the sound waves.

207
00:21:24,348 --> 00:21:28,210
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like... This is what we do when we don't have...

208
00:21:28,888 --> 00:21:31,870
[SPEAKER_02]: Soundboards with different audio effects.

209
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:34,212
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to make them ourselves.

210
00:21:34,692 --> 00:21:37,515
[SPEAKER_07]: But still, I was like nine when that cover came out.

211
00:21:37,775 --> 00:21:41,738
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you're saying that I was masturbating at nine... Dude, some people were!

212
00:21:41,758 --> 00:21:44,100
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, people can keep magazines.

213
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,541
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't just disappear.

214
00:21:46,081 --> 00:21:48,863
[SPEAKER_07]: But it had like laser on the cover.

215
00:21:48,883 --> 00:21:51,345
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't even remember who was on the cover.

216
00:21:51,385 --> 00:21:53,407
[SPEAKER_07]: It was Gemini, laser, and some chick.

217
00:21:53,567 --> 00:21:54,267
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay!

218
00:21:54,467 --> 00:21:54,708
[SPEAKER_04]: Those...

219
00:21:55,328 --> 00:22:00,171
[SPEAKER_04]: Those Farrah Fawcett posters were in guys' bedrooms for like 25 years.

220
00:22:00,871 --> 00:22:01,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

221
00:22:01,271 --> 00:22:02,192
[SPEAKER_04]: They need lives then.

222
00:22:02,332 --> 00:22:02,812
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess so.

223
00:22:03,052 --> 00:22:05,674
[SPEAKER_04]: And Loki, what are you talking about that we don't have a soundboard here at the station?

224
00:22:06,854 --> 00:22:07,895
[SPEAKER_04]: God damn!

225
00:22:08,916 --> 00:22:09,816
[SPEAKER_15]: Ow, my foot!

226
00:22:10,016 --> 00:22:12,137
[SPEAKER_15]: Why did I shoot myself in my foot?

227
00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:17,407
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I have something else.

228
00:22:17,647 --> 00:22:17,828
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

229
00:22:18,148 --> 00:22:18,768
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, and a drink.

230
00:22:20,129 --> 00:22:26,872
[SPEAKER_07]: We were at IHOP today, and we were sitting in the back of the place, because that's where they made us sit.

231
00:22:27,552 --> 00:22:36,376
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we're having our normal discussions, and Extifer has his little rainbow shirt on, and Justin, I don't know, did you say Jazz or Jazz?

232
00:22:36,896 --> 00:22:37,436
[SPEAKER_07]: Justin, okay.

233
00:22:38,497 --> 00:22:39,197
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, my bad.

234
00:22:39,417 --> 00:22:39,997
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

235
00:23:02,935 --> 00:23:03,636
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

236
00:23:22,628 --> 00:23:25,009
[SPEAKER_04]: That guy on that radio show said he was gay.

237
00:23:25,729 --> 00:23:26,269
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh no.

238
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:32,391
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, come to think of it, we have an interesting setup tonight because I know, I was like, well wait a second.

239
00:23:32,451 --> 00:23:38,233
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki's sitting in the center of the room and he's surrounded by a bunch of bags.

240
00:23:39,054 --> 00:23:40,194
[SPEAKER_03]: Eh, I'm used to it.

241
00:23:41,114 --> 00:23:42,255
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you mean you're used to it?

242
00:23:42,275 --> 00:23:43,875
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you mean you're used to it?

243
00:23:44,415 --> 00:23:44,896
[SPEAKER_02]: What the hell?

244
00:23:44,936 --> 00:23:46,696
[SPEAKER_02]: We shared an apartment for like two years.

245
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:47,616
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, come on.

246
00:23:48,037 --> 00:23:51,118
[SPEAKER_03]: So when Rob had his orgies in the middle of it?

247
00:23:51,158 --> 00:23:52,098
[SPEAKER_03]: I never had orgies.

248
00:23:55,146 --> 00:23:56,867
[SPEAKER_03]: is the best spot to see the TV.

249
00:23:57,707 --> 00:23:58,547
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, hold on.

250
00:23:59,007 --> 00:24:00,248
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on to this biscuit, Loki.

251
00:24:00,588 --> 00:24:01,468
[SPEAKER_04]: Just close your eyes.

252
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:04,889
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, moving on.

253
00:24:04,949 --> 00:24:06,590
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else you want to share about your week?

254
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:07,450
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

255
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:08,250
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

256
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:09,471
[SPEAKER_04]: You can go back to Meteos now.

257
00:24:09,511 --> 00:24:09,831
[SPEAKER_04]: Hooray.

258
00:24:10,391 --> 00:24:12,211
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, this is the first time you've played Meteos.

259
00:24:12,251 --> 00:24:12,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, really.

260
00:24:12,852 --> 00:24:14,272
[SPEAKER_07]: This is pretty much the first time I've played it.

261
00:24:14,292 --> 00:24:14,932
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty cool, huh?

262
00:24:15,192 --> 00:24:15,632
[SPEAKER_07]: What did I tell you?

263
00:24:15,712 --> 00:24:22,715
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate it because there's nothing really to do in it, but then I just got to keep moving the stylus and make blocks fly up, but they fall back down.

264
00:24:23,355 --> 00:24:23,435
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

265
00:24:24,854 --> 00:24:25,895
[SPEAKER_04]: This makes me think of a question.

266
00:24:25,955 --> 00:24:27,996
[SPEAKER_04]: At Konami, are you allowed to play?

267
00:24:28,036 --> 00:24:29,657
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you get your breaks and lunch.

268
00:24:29,697 --> 00:24:31,598
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm assuming they don't slave drive you guys too much.

269
00:24:31,618 --> 00:24:33,118
[SPEAKER_04]: You actually get a break and a lunch.

270
00:24:33,318 --> 00:24:33,779
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.

271
00:24:34,219 --> 00:24:35,500
[SPEAKER_07]: We play whatever we want.

272
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:38,421
[SPEAKER_07]: I play Pump It Up there.

273
00:24:38,801 --> 00:24:40,402
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you play whatever you want on your breaks?

274
00:24:40,822 --> 00:24:46,205
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, it was funny because I was playing Pump It Up and I was talking to somebody that was a little higher up than me.

275
00:24:46,685 --> 00:24:49,086
[SPEAKER_07]: I was saying how much I like Pump It Up more than DDR.

276
00:24:49,507 --> 00:24:50,247
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the higher up

277
00:24:50,666 --> 00:24:54,469
[SPEAKER_07]: for all of us came in and he told him and I had to explain myself.

278
00:24:55,449 --> 00:24:55,890
[SPEAKER_07]: It was great.

279
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:56,990
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, I play Pump there.

280
00:24:57,751 --> 00:24:59,132
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty much all I do on breaks.

281
00:25:02,154 --> 00:25:02,674
[SPEAKER_04]: That's great.

282
00:25:02,994 --> 00:25:06,577
[SPEAKER_04]: What are other hot games in the office right now that are not Konami made?

283
00:25:06,817 --> 00:25:08,998
[SPEAKER_07]: Dr. Mario for Nintendo 64.

284
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:12,341
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of random.

285
00:25:12,401 --> 00:25:12,741
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't even...

286
00:25:13,001 --> 00:25:15,704
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't even know they made Dr. Mario and Tetris 64.

287
00:25:16,284 --> 00:25:19,207
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember Pokemon Puzzle League, but I don't remember Dr. Mario 64.

288
00:25:19,247 --> 00:25:21,649
[SPEAKER_02]: Wasn't it like Dr. Mario and Tetris or something?

289
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:23,411
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's right.

290
00:25:23,931 --> 00:25:24,492
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure.

291
00:25:25,313 --> 00:25:28,115
[SPEAKER_07]: Pump It Up and Forza Motorsport.

292
00:25:28,255 --> 00:25:30,478
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the ones that get played that aren't Konami games.

293
00:25:30,578 --> 00:25:32,099
[SPEAKER_07]: You mean you're not playing Enthusia?

294
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:35,382
[SPEAKER_07]: Forza Motorsport is what we play there.

295
00:25:35,823 --> 00:25:36,343
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing else.

296
00:25:37,905 --> 00:25:38,265
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

297
00:25:40,385 --> 00:25:46,508
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and on a, I have to ask, maybe you can't tell me because this is a Konami-related game, but how's the Winx game turning out?

298
00:25:47,288 --> 00:25:47,808
[SPEAKER_04]: NDA.

299
00:25:48,629 --> 00:25:49,089
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn you.

300
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:53,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Can't tell me shit about DDR, now you can't tell me shit about the Winx?

301
00:25:53,431 --> 00:25:58,353
[SPEAKER_02]: Winx Club has now been, it's been relabeled as adult only, so, you know.

302
00:25:58,653 --> 00:26:01,254
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I mean, dude, the Winx get topless.

303
00:26:03,575 --> 00:26:05,116
[SPEAKER_04]: The Winx hot coffee edition.

304
00:26:06,434 --> 00:26:08,035
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, it wouldn't surprise me.

305
00:26:08,195 --> 00:26:09,095
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all I'll say.

306
00:26:09,695 --> 00:26:10,255
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoa, hey.

307
00:26:10,895 --> 00:26:11,696
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, moving on.

308
00:26:11,716 --> 00:26:13,016
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what the franchise needs.

309
00:26:13,996 --> 00:26:15,797
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go over to Justin.

310
00:26:15,917 --> 00:26:16,437
[SPEAKER_04]: How was your week?

311
00:26:16,477 --> 00:26:17,157
[SPEAKER_04]: How was your day, sir?

312
00:26:17,978 --> 00:26:20,578
[SPEAKER_09]: My week was pretty uneventful.

313
00:26:20,718 --> 00:26:30,741
[SPEAKER_09]: I played Final Fantasy for most of the week, and when I wasn't playing Final Fantasy, I was starting up school again, which kind of sucks, but it's something to do, so that's good enough for me.

314
00:26:31,902 --> 00:26:36,083
[SPEAKER_09]: Then on Saturday morning, I drove up here, and we hung out

315
00:26:36,693 --> 00:26:44,395
[SPEAKER_09]: and we went to IHOP and that was funny with the lesbians because they specifically told me that it was because of my shirt they could tell we were all gay.

316
00:26:45,475 --> 00:26:47,415
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, your shirt made us all gay.

317
00:26:47,775 --> 00:26:47,875
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

318
00:26:47,895 --> 00:26:48,295
[SPEAKER_04]: That's great.

319
00:26:48,635 --> 00:26:49,035
[SPEAKER_09]: I love it.

320
00:26:49,516 --> 00:26:53,936
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, because gays aren't allowed to associate with straights in public, only behind closed doors, apparently.

321
00:26:54,176 --> 00:26:54,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Indeed.

322
00:26:56,277 --> 00:26:57,637
[SPEAKER_09]: Besides that, that's about it.

323
00:26:58,537 --> 00:26:58,857
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

324
00:26:59,157 --> 00:26:59,337
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

325
00:26:59,617 --> 00:27:00,038
[SPEAKER_04]: Exciting.

326
00:27:00,958 --> 00:27:02,258
[SPEAKER_04]: Extra for anything you want to share?

327
00:27:05,293 --> 00:27:08,334
[SPEAKER_05]: My week was really cool, I guess.

328
00:27:08,954 --> 00:27:09,594
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

329
00:27:09,674 --> 00:27:12,495
[SPEAKER_05]: I watched a lot of South Park.

330
00:27:13,115 --> 00:27:14,576
[SPEAKER_05]: I went to work.

331
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:15,436
[SPEAKER_05]: I slept.

332
00:27:16,016 --> 00:27:18,677
[SPEAKER_05]: It was very uneventful, but it was good.

333
00:27:18,717 --> 00:27:23,318
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes, ironically, the boring weeks become the better weeks sometimes.

334
00:27:24,798 --> 00:27:28,179
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a small little thing to add on to what Christopher just said.

335
00:27:28,199 --> 00:27:28,299
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

336
00:27:29,286 --> 00:27:37,949
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, don't ask me why I was watching UPN, but for some reason UPN was on the TV, and apparently UPN is getting South Park now.

337
00:27:38,569 --> 00:27:42,090
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, what the hell would you want to watch South Park on UPN for?

338
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:43,951
[SPEAKER_02]: You wouldn't.

339
00:27:44,351 --> 00:27:45,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly!

340
00:27:47,232 --> 00:27:49,292
[SPEAKER_07]: Christopher, what else did you watch that rhymes with the 4400?

341
00:27:49,332 --> 00:27:49,372
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

342
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:53,500
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, maybe you can tell me.

343
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:53,780
[SPEAKER_05]: The 4400.

344
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:56,241
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, that rhymes with 4400.

345
00:27:56,741 --> 00:27:57,642
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an awesome show.

346
00:27:57,722 --> 00:27:59,422
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, I forgot to add that to mine.

347
00:27:59,442 --> 00:28:03,004
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, and Shane or Mikla Tav bought me Final Fantasy XI.

348
00:28:03,104 --> 00:28:04,405
[SPEAKER_05]: You can call him Shane, that's all right.

349
00:28:04,525 --> 00:28:07,486
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Shane, by the way, bought me Final Fantasy XI.

350
00:28:07,646 --> 00:28:13,469
[SPEAKER_04]: The listeners will just have to draw a chart at home to keep track of, okay, here's their online name and here's their real name.

351
00:28:13,769 --> 00:28:14,189
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.

352
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:18,131
[SPEAKER_05]: And he got me into Final Fantasy XI.

353
00:28:18,171 --> 00:28:19,852
[SPEAKER_09]: Hooray, I converted somebody.

354
00:28:21,844 --> 00:28:22,325
[SPEAKER_09]: I helped.

355
00:28:23,025 --> 00:28:26,507
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah, and I made Shane watch Mean Girls for the first time and he loved it.

356
00:28:27,007 --> 00:28:28,248
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an awesome movie.

357
00:28:28,488 --> 00:28:29,368
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really, really funny.

358
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:33,150
[SPEAKER_05]: And today has been cool.

359
00:28:34,411 --> 00:28:34,871
[SPEAKER_04]: That's good.

360
00:28:35,431 --> 00:28:36,592
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad you're having a cool day.

361
00:28:40,628 --> 00:28:41,348
[SPEAKER_04]: My week and my day.

362
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:44,489
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I had a pretty shitty week because I've been sick all week.

363
00:28:44,809 --> 00:28:46,510
[SPEAKER_04]: You can probably hear it now a little bit.

364
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:53,652
[SPEAKER_04]: I know my voice is usually kind of nasal, but especially so tonight because I had a sinus infection this week, so it was pretty bad.

365
00:28:54,532 --> 00:28:59,553
[SPEAKER_04]: Weird enough, I'm pretty confident that I caught it on my plane ride back from the East Coast.

366
00:29:00,564 --> 00:29:01,806
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.

367
00:29:21,874 --> 00:29:23,095
[SPEAKER_02]: Coming back on the plane.

368
00:29:23,416 --> 00:29:24,517
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, coming back on the plane.

369
00:29:24,557 --> 00:29:26,959
[SPEAKER_04]: I was pretty sure I caught my sinus infection there.

370
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,201
[SPEAKER_04]: I did not get bit by a mosquito on the plane.

371
00:29:29,241 --> 00:29:30,523
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't let mosquitoes in planes.

372
00:29:35,868 --> 00:29:39,131
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, the profile of the mosquito matches that of a terrorist.

373
00:29:39,151 --> 00:29:40,372
[SPEAKER_02]: You cannot board the plane.

374
00:29:43,415 --> 00:29:43,896
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys.

375
00:29:46,488 --> 00:29:50,769
[SPEAKER_04]: So I got the sinus infection on the plane, but the symptoms didn't really set in until like Monday night.

376
00:29:50,849 --> 00:29:52,310
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was really, really sick.

377
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:59,312
[SPEAKER_04]: And I went to work anyway because my job is kind of one of those where it's not easy for me to call in sick.

378
00:29:59,752 --> 00:30:02,733
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Extifer, yes, is reaching for a microphone, yes.

379
00:30:03,693 --> 00:30:05,113
[SPEAKER_05]: You can so call in sick.

380
00:30:05,133 --> 00:30:07,114
[SPEAKER_05]: There's so many people that can work for you.

381
00:30:07,174 --> 00:30:07,514
[SPEAKER_05]: You're just...

382
00:30:08,052 --> 00:30:14,315
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how things are going to be when I get back, and I might be creating more work for myself by calling in sick.

383
00:30:14,335 --> 00:30:14,815
[SPEAKER_04]: See what I'm saying?

384
00:30:14,835 --> 00:30:15,475
[SPEAKER_04]: See what I'm saying?

385
00:30:30,441 --> 00:30:31,562
[SPEAKER_05]: Take care of yourself first.

386
00:30:31,762 --> 00:30:32,123
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.

387
00:30:32,903 --> 00:30:33,604
[SPEAKER_04]: I took care of myself.

388
00:30:33,624 --> 00:30:34,445
[SPEAKER_04]: I slept all night.

389
00:30:34,705 --> 00:30:36,787
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I have nothing to say about my weight because I slept.

390
00:30:36,967 --> 00:30:45,595
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to admit, when I go home and I see you in any pose sleeping on the couch, it's fucking hilarious.

391
00:30:46,335 --> 00:30:48,077
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you look funny when you sleep and you're sick.

392
00:30:48,976 --> 00:30:54,059
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob would also like to add that he will have something to talk about next week because he has Hello Kitty Roller Rescue.

393
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:54,479
[SPEAKER_04]: I did.

394
00:30:54,539 --> 00:30:58,921
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki didn't buy me, but obtained me a copy through his work.

395
00:30:59,301 --> 00:31:01,382
[SPEAKER_04]: Not through pirating, actually, but through his work.

396
00:31:01,903 --> 00:31:04,884
[SPEAKER_04]: Obtained me a copy of Hello Kitty Roller Rescue, so I'm really excited.

397
00:31:05,084 --> 00:31:10,167
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have a reason to dust off the GameCube, since otherwise the damn thing wouldn't be getting dusted off until 2006.

398
00:31:10,447 --> 00:31:15,250
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because my work looked at me funny when I was excited to get Hello Kitty Roller Rescue.

399
00:31:16,903 --> 00:31:19,567
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm all, yeah, I'm all, hey, my friend's gonna love this game.

400
00:31:19,587 --> 00:31:21,170
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all, right, your friend.

401
00:31:26,518 --> 00:31:26,979
[SPEAKER_04]: That's great.

402
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:29,331
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

403
00:31:48,672 --> 00:31:50,333
[SPEAKER_04]: But I was really missing out on everything else.

404
00:31:50,394 --> 00:31:58,961
[SPEAKER_04]: But since I was living with Loki for the past couple years up until April, I was able to abuse his US PlayStation 2, so I never had to buy one.

405
00:31:59,481 --> 00:32:03,265
[SPEAKER_04]: But now that, you know, Extifer isn't quite the gamer I am.

406
00:32:03,345 --> 00:32:05,066
[SPEAKER_04]: Extifer, do you have any game systems?

407
00:32:05,106 --> 00:32:11,892
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you... I have a GameCube that I love and that I never play either.

408
00:32:12,613 --> 00:32:15,275
[SPEAKER_04]: So we let you on the show because you are a gamer, believe it or not.

409
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:18,225
[SPEAKER_05]: I have played a video game before.

410
00:32:18,726 --> 00:32:19,406
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, that's good.

411
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:20,968
[SPEAKER_04]: What are your favorite GameCube games?

412
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:24,611
[SPEAKER_05]: Metroid Prime.

413
00:32:25,051 --> 00:32:25,772
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

414
00:32:26,052 --> 00:32:26,393
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

415
00:32:27,774 --> 00:32:30,656
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, what did I tell you to say every time somebody brings up Final Fantasy XI?

416
00:32:31,497 --> 00:32:33,599
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn those gil-sellers.

417
00:32:34,259 --> 00:32:34,580
[SPEAKER_04]: Gil-sellers.

418
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:35,721
[SPEAKER_04]: Gil-sellers.

419
00:32:35,741 --> 00:32:36,261
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

420
00:32:36,982 --> 00:32:37,762
[SPEAKER_05]: Them gil-sellers.

421
00:32:37,803 --> 00:32:38,964
[SPEAKER_05]: They sell gils all the time.

422
00:32:40,965 --> 00:32:41,586
[SPEAKER_05]: What's a gil-seller?

423
00:32:45,043 --> 00:32:49,364
[SPEAKER_04]: What's one of the people that sells the currency on eBay and fucks up the economy?

424
00:32:50,464 --> 00:32:51,345
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well, damn them.

425
00:32:51,965 --> 00:32:53,085
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

426
00:32:53,685 --> 00:32:55,066
[SPEAKER_05]: So you just have a GameCube, nothing else?

427
00:32:55,646 --> 00:33:04,268
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a GameCube and a Game Boy Advance, and I have PlayStation 2 games, and I don't have a PlayStation 2, but you have one, so hey.

428
00:33:04,288 --> 00:33:04,728
[SPEAKER_05]: I have one now.

429
00:33:04,748 --> 00:33:05,869
[SPEAKER_05]: You have a tiny one.

430
00:33:06,149 --> 00:33:08,109
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I bought one of the new minis.

431
00:33:08,309 --> 00:33:09,670
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to... Go ahead.

432
00:33:09,810 --> 00:33:10,330
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no, go ahead.

433
00:33:11,246 --> 00:33:15,887
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to get an old-style PlayStation 2, but they're kind of hard to find now.

434
00:33:15,947 --> 00:33:17,248
[SPEAKER_04]: It's because I wanted to put a hard drive in it.

435
00:33:17,668 --> 00:33:19,868
[SPEAKER_04]: But I just decided, you know, fuck it.

436
00:33:19,888 --> 00:33:23,409
[SPEAKER_04]: Most PlayStation 2 games are like $20 now, and there's only a few I want to play.

437
00:33:24,509 --> 00:33:26,570
[SPEAKER_04]: You can still have a hard drive in the mini ones.

438
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:27,150
[SPEAKER_02]: How?

439
00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:28,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Not in it.

440
00:33:28,951 --> 00:33:30,511
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, USB Advanced.

441
00:33:30,991 --> 00:33:32,632
[SPEAKER_02]: You can use the USB hard drives.

442
00:33:32,832 --> 00:33:38,393
[SPEAKER_02]: It supports up to 2TB hard drives, and it'll run just as fast as running off the CD-ROM.

443
00:33:38,911 --> 00:33:39,231
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura,

444
00:34:04,318 --> 00:34:07,660
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, too bad you didn't wait, though, because it's dropping down in price to $99.

445
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:09,961
[SPEAKER_02]: But not until November.

446
00:34:10,702 --> 00:34:12,082
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, to compete with Xbox 360.

447
00:34:12,122 --> 00:34:13,243
[SPEAKER_04]: I saved my receipt, just in case.

448
00:34:13,483 --> 00:34:14,003
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, Rob.

449
00:34:14,023 --> 00:34:15,965
[SPEAKER_04]: He has to be killed off.

450
00:34:16,845 --> 00:34:18,406
[SPEAKER_07]: Those PlayStation 2s aren't new anymore.

451
00:34:18,426 --> 00:34:19,667
[SPEAKER_07]: They've been out for a year.

452
00:34:19,687 --> 00:34:22,508
[SPEAKER_04]: They're new to me, because nobody I know has one, except me.

453
00:34:23,349 --> 00:34:24,689
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, but they're still not new.

454
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:26,190
[SPEAKER_07]: They're new to me.

455
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:27,571
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care if they're not.

456
00:34:27,931 --> 00:34:31,693
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, and the Xbox 360 is cool, because it's going to have Final Fantasy XI.

457
00:34:31,713 --> 00:34:32,474
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why I'm getting it.

458
00:34:34,105 --> 00:34:35,526
[SPEAKER_02]: Which one did you get?

459
00:34:35,586 --> 00:34:39,427
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm getting the one that's worth the money, not the one that's a $300 doorstop.

460
00:34:39,487 --> 00:34:42,728
[SPEAKER_03]: I love how you come on this program to promote non-Kanami games.

461
00:34:43,909 --> 00:34:45,329
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, like Pump.

462
00:34:47,430 --> 00:34:49,811
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll get to your Pump story, don't worry.

463
00:34:49,831 --> 00:34:50,471
[SPEAKER_04]: Hooray.

464
00:34:50,751 --> 00:34:51,292
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll get to that.

465
00:34:53,112 --> 00:34:55,013
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I bought my US PlayStation 2.

466
00:34:55,469 --> 00:34:56,490
[SPEAKER_04]: Final Fantasy X Final Fantasy X

467
00:35:25,316 --> 00:35:25,636
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them.

468
00:35:48,018 --> 00:35:50,600
[SPEAKER_05]: Are there any British soccer player games that we can talk about?

469
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:53,102
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they're downstairs right now, I just saw them outside.

470
00:35:53,742 --> 00:35:55,544
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, I have to go see them again.

471
00:35:56,584 --> 00:35:58,225
[SPEAKER_02]: Winning 11, you can talk about winning 11.

472
00:35:58,265 --> 00:35:59,566
[SPEAKER_04]: We can talk about winning 11, I don't know.

473
00:36:00,527 --> 00:36:02,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, go have fun next to her.

474
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:04,830
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

475
00:36:05,791 --> 00:36:13,637
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, I guess what we'll do now, why don't we go to a quick break, then we're going to come back and talk about some actual Bomani news, things that are going on in the Bomani world.

476
00:36:14,357 --> 00:36:15,338
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, let's.

477
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:44,095
[SPEAKER_04]: and then we'll also open up the skype line a little later on in the show so you guys if you have anything you want to ask Miklatov or us you can because I'm sure folks are going to try and get some information on Miklatov even though he ain't going to tell you anything but you can try so we'll open up the skype line for you guys a little later on so if you guys want to be able to call on the show you have to head on over to our skype line www.orangeloungeradio.com and click on interact with us

478
00:36:45,074 --> 00:36:50,105
[SPEAKER_04]: and meanwhile we'll do some more announced music for DDR Extreme 2.

479
00:36:50,205 --> 00:36:52,490
[SPEAKER_04]: Started off with a little bit of Boom Boom Dollar.

480
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:53,412
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be back after this.

481
00:41:11,643 --> 00:41:24,472
And the heat of the night, the night And the heat of the night, the night Why did our feelings die in action When we fought for satisfaction But our hearts end at the web Save me

482
00:41:40,727 --> 00:41:42,570
[SPEAKER_15]: Why, little love, all this magic

483
00:42:45,589 --> 00:42:51,592
[SPEAKER_15]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 154 in progress.

484
00:42:51,612 --> 00:42:56,654
[SPEAKER_15]: We were talking a little bit about our weeks and our days.

485
00:43:09,090 --> 00:43:11,971
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we're going to talk a little bit about some things that are going on in the Bomani world.

486
00:43:12,651 --> 00:43:27,594
[SPEAKER_04]: I suppose, even though we've really just beat this topic into the freaking ground over the past few episodes, I think we sort of have to kind of say something about the recent developments in the Konami vs. Roxxor case.

487
00:43:28,735 --> 00:43:30,295
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, basically here it is.

488
00:43:30,395 --> 00:43:33,216
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just going to give you the short version, then you can say what you want, and we'll be done.

489
00:43:34,452 --> 00:43:47,002
[SPEAKER_04]: DDR Freak kind of used their account into the government public system, I think it's called PACER or something, to pull the latest documents in the case, because these are all publicly available documents.

490
00:43:47,062 --> 00:43:51,765
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not, you know, anything that's filed in a court of law, well, almost anything is usually publicly available.

491
00:43:52,185 --> 00:43:57,069
[SPEAKER_04]: So they basically pulled the official response to Konami's original claims.

492
00:43:58,350 --> 00:44:01,953
[SPEAKER_04]: Rock Sword responded to those on July 25th, so they went ahead and put those on their site.

493
00:44:02,593 --> 00:44:06,856
[SPEAKER_04]: And basically, in short, Rockstar says, we deny, we deny, we deny.

494
00:44:07,256 --> 00:44:10,919
[SPEAKER_04]: We request that Konami's patent on DDR be invalidated.

495
00:44:11,219 --> 00:44:14,902
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's part of a countersuit, which Rockstar went ahead with doing a countersuit there.

496
00:44:15,502 --> 00:44:17,744
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Konami responded on August 15th.

497
00:44:18,988 --> 00:44:24,992
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing really earth-shaking there, just basically deny, deny, deny, you know, we'll see you in court type thing.

498
00:44:25,992 --> 00:44:28,434
[SPEAKER_04]: Also posted something called an order for discovery.

499
00:44:28,894 --> 00:44:37,299
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of the most interesting thing in there, I think, as it was, because I don't profess to be a lawyer, so I'm not going to try and make sense of these documents.

500
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:43,783
[SPEAKER_04]: But the order for discovery has like a timetable of what a possible trial would look like.

501
00:44:44,143 --> 00:44:46,284
[SPEAKER_04]: Get this, a trial date would be February of 2007.

502
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:55,006
[SPEAKER_04]: So this Konami vs. Rocksaur bitching would go on well through, like, Extreme 4 and In the Groove 4.

503
00:44:55,886 --> 00:44:59,349
[SPEAKER_04]: So, we're screwed either way.

504
00:45:00,290 --> 00:45:03,913
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to check this out for yourself, www.ddrfreak.com.

505
00:45:03,993 --> 00:45:06,575
[SPEAKER_04]: You can check out the original documents posted there.

506
00:45:07,816 --> 00:45:09,818
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, did you check this out?

507
00:45:10,738 --> 00:45:11,439
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, briefly.

508
00:45:11,679 --> 00:45:11,919
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

509
00:45:14,522 --> 00:45:19,385
[SPEAKER_02]: Please make it so Konami can't use their patents so we can steal it.

510
00:45:21,266 --> 00:45:21,866
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, you know what?

511
00:45:21,906 --> 00:45:22,747
[SPEAKER_02]: In the group, guess what?

512
00:45:22,827 --> 00:45:27,169
[SPEAKER_02]: Rocks are... There's some modifiers that you don't have yet that are in Pump It Up.

513
00:45:27,229 --> 00:45:28,310
[SPEAKER_02]: Go steal those now.

514
00:45:30,564 --> 00:45:32,525
[SPEAKER_04]: would it be stealing though?

515
00:45:32,545 --> 00:45:48,471
[SPEAKER_04]: because now they're working with Andamira which I think would be really funny if those two companies end up merging shut up right now don't say such horrible things if those two companies end up merging before 2007 how's that going to screw everything up?

516
00:45:48,491 --> 00:45:59,496
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a little difference here watching you guys play Pump It Up today versus watching In The Groove it's like night and day the videos in Pump It Up

517
00:46:00,270 --> 00:46:01,951
[SPEAKER_02]: Phenomenal, the videos in the group.

518
00:46:04,812 --> 00:46:05,972
[SPEAKER_02]: There's videos in the group?

519
00:46:05,992 --> 00:46:06,032
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

520
00:46:07,373 --> 00:46:10,014
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's just some random crap.

521
00:46:11,254 --> 00:46:22,979
[SPEAKER_02]: Just the whole step charts, you know, that's, you know, granted, Pump It Up has some really retarded ones, like 17, you know, difficulty stuff, which, you know, in the group, you know, they're falling behind here.

522
00:46:23,039 --> 00:46:25,199
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they're a little ahead of you.

523
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:27,580
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I don't know.

524
00:46:28,521 --> 00:46:29,081
[SPEAKER_02]: To be honest...

525
00:46:29,957 --> 00:46:32,119
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

526
00:46:53,651 --> 00:46:55,593
[SPEAKER_02]: and it has more songs and it's red.

527
00:46:56,153 --> 00:47:10,123
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't gone to check it out but I have a good excuse because the arcade it's at is right on the same area or right on the same lot as the state fairgrounds and the state fair is going on right now so you can't get a parking space anywhere near the arcade so forget it.

528
00:47:10,203 --> 00:47:17,968
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to pay ten dollars to go freaking park in the state fair parking lot and go to go play in the group two of all things.

529
00:47:18,128 --> 00:47:20,930
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, oh yeah.

530
00:47:21,090 --> 00:47:22,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though I try not to

531
00:47:23,372 --> 00:47:25,672
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't care anymore.

532
00:47:25,913 --> 00:47:26,513
[SPEAKER_02]: I really don't.

533
00:47:26,573 --> 00:47:27,293
[SPEAKER_02]: The game sucks.

534
00:47:28,293 --> 00:47:29,033
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the way I think.

535
00:47:29,153 --> 00:47:30,533
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you love it.

536
00:47:30,713 --> 00:47:30,973
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.

537
00:47:31,133 --> 00:47:31,674
[SPEAKER_02]: You like crap.

538
00:47:31,714 --> 00:47:32,834
[SPEAKER_02]: Big deal.

539
00:47:33,194 --> 00:47:34,134
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know what?

540
00:47:34,254 --> 00:47:35,734
[SPEAKER_02]: There are people that like crap out there.

541
00:47:35,754 --> 00:47:37,074
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I like bad movies.

542
00:47:37,595 --> 00:47:38,995
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people say, what the hell's wrong with you?

543
00:47:39,175 --> 00:47:40,415
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, I like bad movies.

544
00:47:40,495 --> 00:47:41,315
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, what the hell?

545
00:47:41,835 --> 00:47:46,236
[SPEAKER_02]: So, if you like, you know, inferior games, if you think it's fun, hey, good.

546
00:47:46,416 --> 00:47:47,196
[SPEAKER_02]: It's your niche.

547
00:47:47,316 --> 00:47:50,157
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, someone's buying them, so somebody out there likes them.

548
00:47:50,617 --> 00:47:50,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.

549
00:47:51,617 --> 00:47:51,697
[SPEAKER_04]: Um,

550
00:47:52,935 --> 00:48:01,519
[SPEAKER_04]: Miklatov, now I know you really, really probably can't comment on these, because especially in your position, you'd be in a world of hurt, but is there anything you do want to say?

551
00:48:01,739 --> 00:48:03,979
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm taking off my Konami hat for a second.

552
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:04,420
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

553
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:06,120
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, in the groove is stupid.

554
00:48:07,561 --> 00:48:14,044
[SPEAKER_07]: When I read the countersuit, I thought, you know, wow, you know, Rockstar's really taking a chance with four-year-old lawyers.

555
00:48:15,544 --> 00:48:19,886
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, apparently, no, no, wait a minute, apparently now in the, um, uh,

556
00:48:20,851 --> 00:48:21,993
[SPEAKER_04]: I once went to a trial

557
00:48:39,264 --> 00:48:46,649
[SPEAKER_04]: But he says in the article that the Roxxor legal team is actually a pretty well-respected group from the Bay Area.

558
00:48:46,969 --> 00:48:52,133
[SPEAKER_07]: In the park, you know, in the little sandbox, when they have their little shovels and tails.

559
00:48:53,454 --> 00:48:54,415
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm sorry.

560
00:48:54,915 --> 00:48:57,417
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything Loki said is how I feel.

561
00:48:57,617 --> 00:49:03,021
[SPEAKER_07]: It's inferior, and Roxxor's just whiny because they want money off somebody else's game.

562
00:49:03,501 --> 00:49:04,221
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, wait a minute, though.

563
00:49:04,261 --> 00:49:04,502
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's...

564
00:49:05,782 --> 00:49:08,923
[SPEAKER_04]: I promised myself I wouldn't get into another lawsuit discussion, but I don't care.

565
00:49:09,043 --> 00:49:09,864
[SPEAKER_04]: I have you here, so.

566
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:10,644
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

567
00:49:12,145 --> 00:49:17,247
[SPEAKER_04]: RockSore, you can look at as like the big corporate evil people that just want money.

568
00:49:17,427 --> 00:49:18,427
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not big.

569
00:49:18,747 --> 00:49:25,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Think about the people that actually made In The Groove, the team that actually made it before it got absolved into RockSore.

570
00:49:26,210 --> 00:49:30,772
[SPEAKER_04]: These guys were DDR fans that just took their obsession to a really extreme level.

571
00:49:31,272 --> 00:49:32,113
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and you know what?

572
00:49:32,133 --> 00:49:43,102
[SPEAKER_07]: They could have kept it kind of on the download and small and not distribute it and sold it for money and tried to say, oh, it's better and oh, we're so cool.

573
00:49:43,142 --> 00:49:47,586
[SPEAKER_07]: We have somebody that uses different aliases also and all the songs sound the same.

574
00:49:47,606 --> 00:49:49,367
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, good or bad, okay?

575
00:49:49,507 --> 00:49:52,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Good or bad, whether whatever you think of in the group.

576
00:49:52,930 --> 00:49:53,470
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's put it this way.

577
00:49:54,331 --> 00:49:55,212
[SPEAKER_02]: DDR, okay?

578
00:49:55,572 --> 00:50:00,236
[SPEAKER_02]: If they were still making more mixes for the arcade, this would not have even been made.

579
00:50:01,069 --> 00:50:10,073
[SPEAKER_02]: And this game itself is so... I don't even know how they're saying that this is not even copyrighted on Dances Revolution.

580
00:50:10,593 --> 00:50:17,156
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, they changed everything, or what they thought they needed to change, so they wouldn't get sued.

581
00:50:17,376 --> 00:50:18,056
[SPEAKER_02]: That is all.

582
00:50:18,256 --> 00:50:22,118
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, it is an exact duplicate of DDR.

583
00:50:22,518 --> 00:50:25,559
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and what makes it better is, oh, Indie Groove 2 has DDR songs.

584
00:50:27,848 --> 00:50:29,029
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what's going to be interesting?

585
00:50:29,049 --> 00:50:29,489
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know.

586
00:50:29,569 --> 00:50:31,790
[SPEAKER_04]: I always thought that's very weird.

587
00:50:31,890 --> 00:50:34,131
[SPEAKER_04]: Why are they trying to copy DDR?

588
00:50:34,151 --> 00:50:35,872
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, hey, we're getting away with this.

589
00:50:35,932 --> 00:50:39,854
[SPEAKER_07]: Now we're just going to put your songs in here, too, and make quote-unquote better steps.

590
00:50:40,154 --> 00:50:41,175
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the interesting thing, though.

591
00:50:41,215 --> 00:50:41,775
[SPEAKER_04]: Imagine this.

592
00:50:41,835 --> 00:50:47,278
[SPEAKER_04]: Whether you're on the in-the-group side or on the DDR side or on the don't-give-a-shit side, picture this.

593
00:50:47,398 --> 00:50:51,881
[SPEAKER_04]: The jury trial that might happen if they don't settle might happen in 2007.

594
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:55,508
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to show a jury these two games.

595
00:50:55,828 --> 00:51:00,549
[SPEAKER_04]: This jury will not have a DDR or In The Groove fan on it, no matter what.

596
00:51:00,629 --> 00:51:08,932
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if people consider themselves a fan of that game, the lawyer from the opposing side is going to boot them off the jury, no question.

597
00:51:09,032 --> 00:51:11,413
[SPEAKER_04]: So there will not be any DDR or In The Groove fans on this jury.

598
00:51:12,193 --> 00:51:15,434
[SPEAKER_04]: You show somebody who isn't familiar with these dancing games these two games side by side.

599
00:51:15,574 --> 00:51:17,215
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll be like, that's the exact same game.

600
00:51:18,447 --> 00:51:21,437
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just all... Just draw your own conclusions.

601
00:51:21,918 --> 00:51:22,379
[SPEAKER_04]: Picture that.

602
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:23,744
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where this could be headed.

603
00:51:24,185 --> 00:51:25,329
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I'm kind of...

604
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:30,042
[SPEAKER_04]: Surprise that we're not talking settlement yet, but maybe that's still a few months off.

605
00:51:30,483 --> 00:51:32,864
[SPEAKER_04]: They've got to whip their dicks out in the legal sense first.

606
00:51:32,884 --> 00:51:39,729
[SPEAKER_07]: I've heard some rumblings that's going to kind of change things from not the Konami side.

607
00:51:40,349 --> 00:51:42,151
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I was like, don't say too much.

608
00:51:42,191 --> 00:51:42,971
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no, no.

609
00:51:42,991 --> 00:51:44,132
[SPEAKER_07]: It has nothing to do with Konami.

610
00:51:44,372 --> 00:51:44,632
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

611
00:51:44,652 --> 00:51:49,535
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, if what I've heard goes through, I don't even know what's going to happen after that.

612
00:51:50,696 --> 00:51:51,157
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

613
00:51:51,517 --> 00:51:51,757
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

614
00:51:52,257 --> 00:51:52,858
[SPEAKER_04]: Very interesting.

615
00:51:53,458 --> 00:51:53,738
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

616
00:51:54,199 --> 00:51:55,479
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't want it to go through.

617
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:57,361
[SPEAKER_04]: at all.

618
00:51:57,961 --> 00:51:59,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye-bye.

619
00:52:17,130 --> 00:52:19,711
[SPEAKER_04]: That rumor's been going around ever since Andomero published.

620
00:52:19,731 --> 00:52:30,413
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, I would rather see Andomero take on, you know, in the groove and actually be able to develop it, because obviously it looks like their programmers and game designers know what the fuck they're doing versus these guys.

621
00:52:30,474 --> 00:52:36,375
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, these guys may have taken, you know, an okay direction, but Andomero's going to be the ones going to put the polish on things.

622
00:52:36,795 --> 00:52:43,697
[SPEAKER_04]: But the weird thing, if Andomero were to absolve Rockstar or whatever, Andomero and Konami kind of have that

623
00:52:44,964 --> 00:52:46,925
[SPEAKER_07]: They pay money to put out games.

624
00:52:46,945 --> 00:52:48,405
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the games can coexist.

625
00:52:48,445 --> 00:52:51,706
[SPEAKER_04]: They basically have that these games can coexist agreement, whatever that may be.

626
00:52:51,886 --> 00:52:53,527
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why it's going to be weird.

627
00:52:53,747 --> 00:53:00,149
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, it's weird, but hey, if they want to, you know, draw a truce or whatever, I'm fine with it.

628
00:53:00,169 --> 00:53:06,231
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, a little healthy competition never hurt anybody because it'd be an easy win for DDR, but you know.

629
00:53:06,638 --> 00:53:09,199
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're okay with In The Groove being out there and making new mixes?

630
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:10,280
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm fine with it being out there.

631
00:53:11,121 --> 00:53:12,541
[SPEAKER_02]: If I don't like the game, I don't play it.

632
00:53:12,601 --> 00:53:13,442
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty simple.

633
00:53:13,502 --> 00:53:16,704
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's not like I'm forced to play it when I walk into an arcade.

634
00:53:16,804 --> 00:53:18,565
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know what?

635
00:53:18,985 --> 00:53:19,785
[SPEAKER_02]: I've played worse.

636
00:53:20,386 --> 00:53:21,626
[SPEAKER_02]: I've played worse games out there.

637
00:53:21,787 --> 00:53:27,830
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell, I've played a lot of dancing games that have just... I played that one game that was like Itoy Groove, okay?

638
00:53:27,850 --> 00:53:28,891
[SPEAKER_02]: That was an arcade game.

639
00:53:29,231 --> 00:53:30,371
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that game... I Can Dance?

640
00:53:31,172 --> 00:53:31,812
[SPEAKER_04]: Or I Can Boogie?

641
00:53:32,032 --> 00:53:32,613
[SPEAKER_02]: I Can Boogie.

642
00:53:32,873 --> 00:53:34,474
[SPEAKER_02]: That game sucks ass, okay?

643
00:53:34,514 --> 00:53:34,834
[SPEAKER_02]: This is...

644
00:53:35,743 --> 00:53:38,285
[SPEAKER_02]: In a whole new dimension of crap, okay?

645
00:53:38,785 --> 00:53:40,987
[SPEAKER_02]: That In The Groove would never ever be able to touch.

646
00:53:42,428 --> 00:53:47,372
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've played Dance Station 3DDX, which is really interesting.

647
00:53:47,392 --> 00:53:51,835
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that one's a real weird game, but I found it to be pretty fun.

648
00:53:52,015 --> 00:53:53,657
[SPEAKER_02]: So, who cares?

649
00:53:53,937 --> 00:53:54,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Put another game out there.

650
00:53:55,058 --> 00:53:56,579
[SPEAKER_02]: Give some people some choice, you know?

651
00:53:57,139 --> 00:53:58,761
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, alright.

652
00:54:00,222 --> 00:54:03,284
[SPEAKER_04]: Extifer, Justin, anything you guys want to say about this whole thing?

653
00:54:03,304 --> 00:54:03,544
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing?

654
00:54:04,145 --> 00:54:04,465
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing?

655
00:54:06,383 --> 00:54:08,226
[SPEAKER_04]: Xtifer's like, I don't know what you're talking about.

656
00:54:10,569 --> 00:54:11,630
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think, Xtifer?

657
00:54:11,670 --> 00:54:14,534
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, okay, I'm actually curious of your perspective.

658
00:54:14,735 --> 00:54:16,497
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you seen the In the Groove game at all?

659
00:54:17,178 --> 00:54:19,401
[SPEAKER_05]: I did see it at the bowling alley.

660
00:54:19,742 --> 00:54:21,424
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, now you're someone who doesn't...

661
00:54:21,957 --> 00:54:26,020
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm curious, as somebody who is not a hardcore fan of these two games, what do you think?

662
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:27,020
[SPEAKER_04]: Is one game a rip-off of the other?

663
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:27,120
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

664
00:54:45,450 --> 00:54:50,034
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that in the groove game looked a lot like DDR.

665
00:54:50,074 --> 00:54:57,040
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it looked like the other game, but the only difference was they had those bombs or mines or whatever.

666
00:54:58,962 --> 00:55:00,043
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the only difference.

667
00:55:00,203 --> 00:55:01,224
[SPEAKER_05]: It basically was DDR.

668
00:55:01,885 --> 00:55:02,185
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

669
00:55:02,245 --> 00:55:02,746
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I thought.

670
00:55:03,026 --> 00:55:04,607
[SPEAKER_04]: See, now that could be what a jury member is going to think.

671
00:55:04,627 --> 00:55:06,269
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't that interesting that I just said that?

672
00:55:06,289 --> 00:55:07,290
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it was riveting.

673
00:55:07,330 --> 00:55:07,590
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

674
00:55:08,652 --> 00:55:21,922
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, sometimes I think folks that are hardcore fans of either In The Groove or DDR, you know, and have too much of a one-track mind where they only see the stuff they want to see in the games.

675
00:55:21,942 --> 00:55:32,291
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't kind of think that, oh, if this really does go to court, an unbiased jury is going to take a look at it and, you know, have their say.

676
00:55:32,891 --> 00:55:33,151
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

677
00:55:34,092 --> 00:55:34,933
[SPEAKER_04]: Enough lawsuit chat.

678
00:55:34,953 --> 00:55:35,273
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm done.

679
00:55:36,527 --> 00:55:39,530
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why somebody would want that, but... No.

680
00:55:39,550 --> 00:55:40,110
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know Noria?

681
00:55:40,130 --> 00:55:40,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you on a first name basis?

682
00:55:40,811 --> 00:55:44,593
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Sana and Togo and all them, they just walk around the office all day, right?

683
00:56:04,813 --> 00:56:06,214
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe in Japan.

684
00:56:07,895 --> 00:56:10,097
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, we occasionally get people in our office.

685
00:56:10,257 --> 00:56:12,119
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't ever remember seeing Noria.

686
00:56:12,779 --> 00:56:15,901
[SPEAKER_07]: And if I did, she'd probably come at me all crazy.

687
00:56:16,382 --> 00:56:20,165
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to understand that Naoki keeps a close eye on his harem, okay?

688
00:56:20,785 --> 00:56:21,906
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't leave Japan.

689
00:56:25,955 --> 00:56:29,797
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember the year that Akira Yamaoka came to E3 and you were just as excited as I was.

690
00:56:29,877 --> 00:56:33,260
[SPEAKER_04]: And I stalked him.

691
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:34,200
[SPEAKER_03]: Three pictures.

692
00:56:35,181 --> 00:56:35,681
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.

693
00:56:37,282 --> 00:56:37,543
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

694
00:56:39,724 --> 00:56:40,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do this.

695
00:56:40,324 --> 00:56:46,449
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go ahead and... Actually, let's move to the Pump It Up topic since we were kind of getting into that a little bit and then we'll open up the skyline after another break.

696
00:56:47,669 --> 00:56:48,170
[SPEAKER_04]: Pump It Up...

697
00:56:50,413 --> 00:56:53,054
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, we actually, this game's not going to be out.

698
00:56:53,114 --> 00:56:55,736
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the official name of the game here we're looking at for Pump It Up?

699
00:56:55,756 --> 00:56:56,776
[SPEAKER_04]: Pump It Up Exceed Home?

700
00:56:56,876 --> 00:56:57,877
[SPEAKER_04]: Pump It Up Exceed.

701
00:56:58,197 --> 00:56:58,897
[SPEAKER_04]: Pump It Up Exceed.

702
00:56:58,917 --> 00:57:00,698
[SPEAKER_04]: The home release is coming out the 31st.

703
00:57:01,819 --> 00:57:05,001
[SPEAKER_04]: We got a copy, though, or I should say, Miklatov got a copy.

704
00:57:05,701 --> 00:57:07,522
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, don't forget to turn on your mic.

705
00:57:08,735 --> 00:57:10,116
[SPEAKER_04]: Heck yeah, I got a copy!

706
00:57:11,136 --> 00:57:12,217
[SPEAKER_04]: How did you get a copy?

707
00:57:12,437 --> 00:57:13,918
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, it's a great story.

708
00:57:14,038 --> 00:57:15,279
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it through sources at Konami?

709
00:57:15,299 --> 00:57:15,699
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no.

710
00:57:16,399 --> 00:57:18,981
[SPEAKER_04]: Secret Andomero agreements where they share games with each other?

711
00:57:19,381 --> 00:57:26,805
[SPEAKER_07]: After work one day, I was like, hey, I want both pump-it-ups for Xbox and PS2 when they come out, because I know they're different.

712
00:57:27,145 --> 00:57:28,706
[SPEAKER_07]: I better go to EB and pre-order them.

713
00:57:29,047 --> 00:57:33,869
[SPEAKER_07]: So I went in there and I pre-ordered it, and the guy was like, hey, we got one traded in today, even though it's not out.

714
00:57:33,969 --> 00:57:34,410
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want it?

715
00:57:34,450 --> 00:57:35,690
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, heck yeah, I want it!

716
00:57:35,990 --> 00:57:36,711
[SPEAKER_07]: So I bought it.

717
00:57:37,011 --> 00:57:39,232
[SPEAKER_03]: How does someone trade something in if it's not out yet?

718
00:57:39,772 --> 00:57:40,813
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even question that.

719
00:57:41,173 --> 00:57:43,814
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that DDR Stream 3?

720
00:57:43,914 --> 00:57:44,794
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

721
00:57:45,134 --> 00:57:51,677
[SPEAKER_07]: They're like, yeah, it doesn't come with the pad, and we're still charging you the price as if it were coming with the pad, but do you want it?

722
00:57:51,837 --> 00:57:53,778
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was like, I'll have it a month early.

723
00:57:53,998 --> 00:57:54,899
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'll take it.

724
00:57:55,679 --> 00:57:57,380
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm just going to trade it in when it actually comes out.

725
00:57:57,400 --> 00:58:00,241
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, I've had the game since about the beginning of August.

726
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:03,121
[SPEAKER_02]: XBOX Ver.

727
00:58:03,141 --> 00:58:03,181
[SPEAKER_02]: PS2

728
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:25,300
[SPEAKER_04]: XSEED Arcade XSEED Arcade

729
00:58:49,767 --> 00:58:55,129
[SPEAKER_07]: and we also gained some of the revival songs from Exceed 2, which is random.

730
00:58:56,510 --> 00:59:05,293
[SPEAKER_07]: They censored a couple of the Spanish songs, which makes no sense to me, and that's about the only differences.

731
00:59:05,673 --> 00:59:07,254
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so tell us about, like, the unlock.

732
00:59:07,294 --> 00:59:08,434
[SPEAKER_07]: How do you unlock songs in the games?

733
00:59:08,574 --> 00:59:10,295
[SPEAKER_07]: I have no clue.

734
00:59:10,355 --> 00:59:13,256
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been playing that game since the beginning of August.

735
00:59:13,336 --> 00:59:18,878
[SPEAKER_07]: I've unlocked four songs now, or, okay, three, and then Justin unlocked one today, and, I mean...

736
00:59:19,458 --> 00:59:21,620
[SPEAKER_07]: If you think about it, there are four modes.

737
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:29,765
[SPEAKER_07]: And to play songs in certain modes, like, say, I want to play... What's a song?

738
00:59:30,125 --> 00:59:33,407
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to play Chicken Wing in survival mode.

739
00:59:33,568 --> 00:59:34,148
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

740
00:59:34,408 --> 00:59:39,311
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's not unlocked in survival mode, so I have to play it in home mode just to unlock it.

741
00:59:40,092 --> 00:59:47,357
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I had to go through the game pretty much and play every song in every mode just to make sure that every song appeared in every mode.

742
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:48,798
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't even have that still!

743
00:59:49,458 --> 00:59:54,262
[SPEAKER_07]: So I've pretty much played over 400 songs, and I've only unlocked four songs.

744
00:59:54,742 --> 00:59:58,125
[SPEAKER_07]: But, along the way, you also unlock modifiers.

745
00:59:58,505 --> 01:00:05,751
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, I've not been totally bored out of my mind playing the same songs over and over again.

746
01:00:06,592 --> 01:00:10,215
[SPEAKER_07]: I get random cool modifiers that are weird.

747
01:00:10,575 --> 01:00:12,156
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the one that was coming from the corner.

748
01:00:12,376 --> 01:00:13,697
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, exceed modifier.

749
01:00:14,098 --> 01:00:15,119
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very hard to read.

750
01:00:15,139 --> 01:00:20,543
[SPEAKER_07]: There's also one where it comes from the bottom middle and just kind of throws it all the way up and then to the side.

751
01:00:21,504 --> 01:00:24,706
[SPEAKER_07]: It also has something like break and something like wave.

752
01:00:25,547 --> 01:00:27,549
[SPEAKER_07]: It has random velocity.

753
01:00:27,649 --> 01:00:29,230
[SPEAKER_07]: You can change the arrow skins.

754
01:00:30,451 --> 01:00:35,335
[SPEAKER_07]: But, yeah, it's a pretty mean game to try to unlock songs in.

755
01:00:35,355 --> 01:00:37,196
[SPEAKER_05]: There's also a boobs and ass video.

756
01:00:37,316 --> 01:00:37,977
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean...

757
01:00:38,769 --> 01:00:40,591
[SPEAKER_05]: I just thought I'd put that in there right there.

758
01:00:40,771 --> 01:00:47,456
[SPEAKER_07]: This game got a T rating, and you know, it censored two Spanish words, but there's a lot of breasts.

759
01:00:47,977 --> 01:00:49,238
[SPEAKER_07]: Lots and lots of breasts.

760
01:00:50,259 --> 01:00:51,160
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't understand it.

761
01:00:51,420 --> 01:00:52,421
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, not bare breasts.

762
01:00:52,581 --> 01:00:56,324
[SPEAKER_07]: No, but I mean, they smack her in the chin when she moves.

763
01:00:56,644 --> 01:00:58,686
[SPEAKER_07]: The whole video is about her breasts.

764
01:00:59,266 --> 01:01:03,789
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of videos that look like internet flash videos out there, but... They're really funny.

765
01:01:03,809 --> 01:01:04,449
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know what, though?

766
01:01:04,549 --> 01:01:13,074
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought... One thing that really impressed me, really, really impressed me about Pump It Up Exceed on PlayStation 2 was the fact that every song had a unique video.

767
01:01:13,554 --> 01:01:18,898
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't some type of loop video, like all these little clips kind of looped over and over again.

768
01:01:18,918 --> 01:01:19,638
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like each one...

769
01:01:19,778 --> 01:01:20,298
[SPEAKER_04]: Rapper's Delight

770
01:01:43,913 --> 01:02:00,878
[SPEAKER_04]: and some of the actual music videos for actual songs Little Less Conversation Little Less Conversation, Name of the Game, and Walkie Talkie Man which is the stupidest song ever on Crazy it's a 17 tell us about where In The Groove might have gotten some of its inspiration from Pump It Up what?

771
01:02:02,008 --> 01:02:02,989
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

772
01:02:27,970 --> 01:02:30,072
[SPEAKER_07]: On Xbox Live, I don't know, it's just kind of weird.

773
01:02:30,092 --> 01:02:36,017
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but I'll be happy because I can finally make steps to like songs that only have one set of steps.

774
01:02:36,317 --> 01:02:41,241
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's not even one set of steps for freestyle and normal, it's just like they only have normal steps.

775
01:02:41,321 --> 01:02:42,522
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's it, and they're like a two.

776
01:02:43,703 --> 01:02:50,548
[SPEAKER_07]: So, it's actually, the Xbox One is probably going to be the best one with song packs and that downloadable step editor.

777
01:02:50,568 --> 01:02:53,911
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, song packs on the Xbox One are going to be a little more expensive though, right?

778
01:02:54,031 --> 01:03:01,573
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I don't think it's actually been officially announced, but they were tossing around the idea of $7 for three songs.

779
01:03:01,913 --> 01:03:03,653
[SPEAKER_07]: However, it would include licenses.

780
01:03:03,913 --> 01:03:09,614
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, it's not like you're going to get... Hopefully, it's not like you're going to get just Banya songs.

781
01:03:10,294 --> 01:03:19,196
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll also get, like, I Hope to Goodness, Luzanka, or Fairy Boat, or Black Cat, or all those really cool songs from the really old games that don't show up anymore.

782
01:03:19,816 --> 01:03:22,277
[SPEAKER_04]: I was pissed off that Run to You was not in the song list.

783
01:03:22,878 --> 01:03:24,563
[SPEAKER_04]: Although the game does have a very impressive song.

784
01:03:24,583 --> 01:03:26,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's really amazing.

785
01:03:26,850 --> 01:03:27,833
[SPEAKER_07]: I couldn't believe it.

786
01:03:28,134 --> 01:03:28,616
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so...

787
01:03:30,442 --> 01:03:35,644
[SPEAKER_04]: Sum up the PlayStation version of Pump It Up Exceed, the good stuff and the bad stuff, and do you recommend it?

788
01:03:35,804 --> 01:03:39,545
[SPEAKER_07]: The good stuff is that it's Pump It Up, and it's the superior dancing game.

789
01:03:41,065 --> 01:03:56,450
[SPEAKER_07]: The bad stuff is that Mad Catz makes the pad, and that some of the steps are just utter crap, because there's no reason Walkie Talkie Man should go to every last little noise in the whole song.

790
01:03:58,271 --> 01:03:58,891
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, the end.

791
01:04:00,119 --> 01:04:02,589
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say, I think that the game is...

792
01:04:03,598 --> 01:04:04,999
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty good looking.

793
01:04:05,139 --> 01:04:06,900
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's got a huge song list.

794
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:10,421
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the fact that there's a unique video for every song.

795
01:04:10,461 --> 01:04:12,262
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's just kind of a fun game.

796
01:04:12,682 --> 01:04:19,306
[SPEAKER_04]: I think some of the songs are kind of a little, like especially some of the Banya songs are a little average.

797
01:04:19,806 --> 01:04:23,127
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Banya is very hit or miss, at least in my eyes.

798
01:04:23,187 --> 01:04:24,748
[SPEAKER_04]: But the K-pop stuff is pretty rad.

799
01:04:24,808 --> 01:04:28,810
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, the K-pop stuff is great, and so is the pop because it's a lot of Latin songs.

800
01:04:29,010 --> 01:04:30,631
[SPEAKER_04]: And the regular pop stuff is cool.

801
01:04:31,371 --> 01:04:34,454
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was very surprised by Pump It Up Home Version.

802
01:04:34,614 --> 01:04:40,078
[SPEAKER_04]: I've gone from probably just not really interested in picking it up to I definitely want to pick this game up.

803
01:04:41,259 --> 01:04:43,040
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's going to be really good.

804
01:04:43,180 --> 01:04:45,202
[SPEAKER_04]: However, the bad things about the game.

805
01:04:45,523 --> 01:04:49,126
[SPEAKER_04]: The interface still annoys the shit out of me.

806
01:04:49,226 --> 01:04:53,729
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate Pump's interface with the passion, and it is no better in XSEED.

807
01:04:53,849 --> 01:05:02,095
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the thing is, it's based off the arcade one, and the arcade one has no, like, left and right buttons, so you have... Still sucks.

808
01:05:02,395 --> 01:05:06,479
[SPEAKER_04]: They could have done something else, I just, I hate the way you put in codes, I, bleh, sucks.

809
01:05:07,759 --> 01:05:11,342
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's why you can play in home mode, and then you can hold the triangle button down and just...

810
01:05:15,851 --> 01:05:16,472
[SPEAKER_04]: Always piss me off.

811
01:05:16,592 --> 01:05:18,573
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, it's not just that.

812
01:05:18,634 --> 01:05:22,877
[SPEAKER_04]: I just don't like the huge wheel that takes forever to get around.

813
01:05:23,238 --> 01:05:23,538
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

814
01:05:23,778 --> 01:05:24,819
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just me.

815
01:05:25,319 --> 01:05:26,480
[SPEAKER_04]: It is.

816
01:05:27,101 --> 01:05:27,441
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care.

817
01:05:27,802 --> 01:05:28,943
[SPEAKER_04]: Justin, what do you think?

818
01:05:28,963 --> 01:05:30,744
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I know you're a long-time DDR fan.

819
01:05:30,764 --> 01:05:32,686
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think of Pump It Up on PlayStation?

820
01:05:33,006 --> 01:05:36,489
[SPEAKER_09]: I was very much like you when I first heard about it.

821
01:05:36,549 --> 01:05:38,071
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like, oh, it's Pump It Up.

822
01:05:38,151 --> 01:05:42,795
[SPEAKER_09]: I've seen that so many times at MGL and Swiggle, the local arcades.

823
01:05:43,234 --> 01:05:44,275
[SPEAKER_09]: and I just do not care.

824
01:05:44,295 --> 01:05:45,476
[SPEAKER_07]: Spiegel doesn't have it anymore.

825
01:05:45,596 --> 01:05:46,417
[SPEAKER_07]: MGL took it.

826
01:05:46,437 --> 01:05:48,699
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me fix that.

827
01:05:48,719 --> 01:05:49,039
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, sorry.

828
01:05:49,119 --> 01:05:50,220
[SPEAKER_09]: That's my local arcade.

829
01:05:51,722 --> 01:06:01,110
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways, but after playing it on Shane's copy, I found it was amazingly fun.

830
01:06:01,150 --> 01:06:08,296
[SPEAKER_09]: I love the fact that the videos are all fun and not just looped animations and they all have a sense of humor to them for the most part.

831
01:06:09,727 --> 01:06:10,107
[SPEAKER_09]: XBOX Ver.

832
01:06:40,037 --> 01:06:41,478
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it looks like a great game.

833
01:06:42,078 --> 01:06:42,258
[SPEAKER_09]: Right?

834
01:06:43,018 --> 01:06:47,401
[SPEAKER_04]: Extifer, what little you saw of the game, what do you think of Pump It Up?

835
01:06:48,541 --> 01:06:51,162
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I saw it as much as you did, I think.

836
01:06:51,342 --> 01:06:52,663
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I guess that's true.

837
01:06:52,683 --> 01:06:53,924
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought you left the room for some reason.

838
01:06:53,984 --> 01:06:54,224
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

839
01:06:54,704 --> 01:07:00,447
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it seems like a game that I'll watch you play occasionally, you know?

840
01:07:01,207 --> 01:07:08,871
[SPEAKER_05]: I won't play it because I, you know, really suck at those games and it just looks really, I don't know, hard to play.

841
01:07:11,277 --> 01:07:11,557
[SPEAKER_04]: The End

842
01:07:28,882 --> 01:07:30,923
[SPEAKER_02]: I call bullshit until I play on one myself.

843
01:07:30,943 --> 01:07:31,303
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see though.

844
01:07:31,323 --> 01:07:31,583
[SPEAKER_04]: Fine, whatever.

845
01:07:31,603 --> 01:07:32,124
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

846
01:07:58,902 --> 01:08:03,324
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to go to a break, you guys, and when we come back, we're going to take your calls on the Skype line.

847
01:08:03,344 --> 01:08:15,188
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll also talk a little bit about the tiny news we had in the... Well, actually, it was kind of major, but I think most of you guys have read about this by now, the Extreme 2 song list, as well as Karaoke Revolution.

848
01:08:15,768 --> 01:08:17,889
[SPEAKER_04]: Some song lists showed up for that as well.

849
01:08:17,909 --> 01:08:21,731
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to talk about all that when we come back from this break, and taking your calls on the Skype line, www.

850
01:08:22,911 --> 01:08:23,692
[SPEAKER_04]: OrangeLoungeRadio.com

851
01:08:55,505 --> 01:08:56,832
Thank you for watching!

852
01:09:23,581 --> 01:09:25,158
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for watching!

Thank you for watching!

854
01:11:07,325 --> 01:11:08,347
Thank you for watching!

855

Thanks for watching!

856
01:16:19,628 --> 01:16:24,893
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge Radio, Mamani Music, and more.

857
01:16:25,073 --> 01:16:27,395
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge Radio, back at you here.

858
01:16:27,535 --> 01:16:36,222
[SPEAKER_04]: In that break, you heard a little bit of Sylvia Drive, Ninth Style, Injection of Love, Red, Inazuma, Happy Sky, Everyday Lovely Day, Eighth Consumer.

859
01:16:37,043 --> 01:16:39,785
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you booing Everyday Lovely Day for, Miglitov?

860
01:16:39,905 --> 01:16:40,986
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a crappy song.

861
01:16:41,647 --> 01:16:42,447
[SPEAKER_04]: You're a crappy song.

862
01:16:42,948 --> 01:16:43,228
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

863
01:16:45,094 --> 01:16:51,279
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to open up the old Skype lines right now and take your calls here on our program.

864
01:16:51,319 --> 01:16:55,702
[SPEAKER_04]: If you'd like to call us, www.orangeloungeradio.com and click on Interact With Us.

865
01:16:56,042 --> 01:17:00,366
[SPEAKER_04]: Miklatov, I did get a question from somebody who is not able to call us on the Skype line.

866
01:17:00,766 --> 01:17:01,907
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, then they're losers.

867
01:17:01,967 --> 01:17:02,708
[SPEAKER_04]: But had a question.

868
01:17:02,748 --> 01:17:03,308
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Rene.

869
01:17:03,588 --> 01:17:05,049
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I might not answer it then.

870
01:17:05,110 --> 01:17:06,811
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Rene had a question.

871
01:17:06,851 --> 01:17:07,251
[SPEAKER_04]: What is it?

872
01:17:07,271 --> 01:17:07,792
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to ask you.

873
01:17:07,832 --> 01:17:08,832
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

874
01:17:09,633 --> 01:17:13,276
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, what he wants to know, is Konami doing anything...

875
01:17:13,857 --> 01:17:22,402
[SPEAKER_04]: for the fan requests on DDR Freak for new stuff, like new mods, new features in DDR, maybe songs.

876
01:17:23,022 --> 01:17:26,284
[SPEAKER_04]: When he says new mods, he's saying things like, you know, Wave, those types of things.

877
01:17:26,945 --> 01:17:29,726
[SPEAKER_07]: Has there been an official request for fan requests?

878
01:17:31,167 --> 01:17:35,530
[SPEAKER_04]: So, in other words, has there been something on DDR Freak asking you to say things?

879
01:17:36,590 --> 01:17:38,071
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't believe I've seen one in a little while.

880
01:17:38,703 --> 01:17:43,126
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, then, they're just requesting stuff that's not being heard.

881
01:17:43,647 --> 01:17:45,128
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, alright, I gotcha.

882
01:17:45,568 --> 01:17:46,208
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye, John!

883
01:17:46,989 --> 01:17:47,369
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

884
01:17:48,150 --> 01:17:48,450
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

885
01:17:48,630 --> 01:17:49,150
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, goody!

886
01:17:49,210 --> 01:17:51,692
[SPEAKER_03]: The gay-straight ratio has gotten worse!

887
01:17:53,033 --> 01:17:56,856
[SPEAKER_04]: My friend John just showed up, so he's here now to further surround Loki.

888
01:17:58,021 --> 01:17:59,402
[SPEAKER_04]: We will make you gay by end of show.

889
01:17:59,422 --> 01:17:59,942
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm kidding.

890
01:18:00,002 --> 01:18:01,643
[SPEAKER_07]: I do have to say, though, I honestly don't know.

891
01:18:03,144 --> 01:18:18,313
[SPEAKER_07]: Usually when Konami wants to listen or really cares to listen, you'll see like a huge thread devoted to, oh, Konami's asking us to, you know, say, put this song in, so please list your songs you want in.

892
01:18:18,613 --> 01:18:19,894
[SPEAKER_04]: Do people now...

893
01:18:20,999 --> 01:18:23,541
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have power over what goes in the game.

894
01:18:36,007 --> 01:18:42,812
[SPEAKER_04]: Do people that have the power to change what's in the game, do they read DDR Freak and those types of things?

895
01:18:43,772 --> 01:18:45,894
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know who would actually have the power to change the game.

896
01:18:46,134 --> 01:18:46,934
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, they do.

897
01:18:47,034 --> 01:18:48,896
[SPEAKER_03]: So keep making those pointless threads!

898
01:18:53,326 --> 01:19:00,552
[SPEAKER_07]: They love it when you make a, please put in Sakura, or please put in, what's another crappy song?

899
01:19:01,452 --> 01:19:02,593
[SPEAKER_07]: A crappy song!

900
01:19:02,633 --> 01:19:03,474
[SPEAKER_06]: Butterfly!

901
01:19:04,315 --> 01:19:06,496
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah, Cartoon Heroes.

902
01:19:08,278 --> 01:19:08,618
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

903
01:19:10,260 --> 01:19:17,065
[SPEAKER_04]: So keep making those pointless threads on DDR Freak with your requests, and maybe somebody from Konami will give a crap.

904
01:19:17,425 --> 01:19:17,886
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll see.

905
01:19:19,131 --> 01:19:20,332
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, when we laugh at it.

906
01:19:20,352 --> 01:19:21,393
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what's going to happen?

907
01:19:21,673 --> 01:19:29,719
[SPEAKER_02]: When the head of PR or whatever is coming out to our company to speak about their games and stuff, I'm just going to say, can you put Sakura in the next one?

908
01:19:29,799 --> 01:19:33,182
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a controversial question for you.

909
01:19:34,485 --> 01:19:36,687
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm playing Meteos, what is it?

910
01:19:37,368 --> 01:19:39,650
[SPEAKER_03]: Do people at the office make fun of DDR Freak posts?

911
01:19:40,011 --> 01:19:41,873
[SPEAKER_07]: I have openly admitted I do.

912
01:19:43,835 --> 01:19:45,136
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody knows I'm the jerk.

913
01:19:45,517 --> 01:19:49,601
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, oh, last year, remember the extreme thread?

914
01:19:49,981 --> 01:19:51,283
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a big joke, it was fun.

915
01:19:51,303 --> 01:19:51,783
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what you need?

916
01:19:51,883 --> 01:19:56,148
[SPEAKER_02]: You need a giant plotter printer so you can print the thread or whatever the post is.

917
01:19:56,528 --> 01:19:59,590
[SPEAKER_02]: Super big on the wall so that you can laugh at it.

918
01:19:59,630 --> 01:20:03,392
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you can just have, like, wallpaper on the wall with really bad posts from DDR3.

919
01:20:03,572 --> 01:20:06,113
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, I'm going to do that in my game room if I ever get one.

920
01:20:07,574 --> 01:20:08,954
[SPEAKER_03]: How come you guys didn't do clues this year?

921
01:20:10,075 --> 01:20:11,095
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't really say.

922
01:20:11,636 --> 01:20:12,896
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

923
01:20:12,916 --> 01:20:13,436
[SPEAKER_04]: That's that.

924
01:20:13,817 --> 01:20:14,817
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all GamePro's fault.

925
01:20:14,977 --> 01:20:15,658
[SPEAKER_04]: All GamePro.

926
01:20:15,838 --> 01:20:16,438
[SPEAKER_04]: I got served.

927
01:20:16,458 --> 01:20:17,378
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's all GamePro's fault.

928
01:20:17,839 --> 01:20:18,499
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to a call.

929
01:20:19,279 --> 01:20:20,720
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.

930
01:20:23,401 --> 01:20:23,982
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, my friend.

931
01:20:24,022 --> 01:20:24,482
[SPEAKER_04]: What's on your mind?

932
01:20:25,782 --> 01:20:26,922
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, let me see.

933
01:20:27,023 --> 01:20:29,444
[SPEAKER_08]: Just, you know, going through the usual on a Sunday.

934
01:20:30,024 --> 01:20:35,426
[SPEAKER_08]: Me heading out to Long Island to play 2DX and breaking another in the group machine in the city.

935
01:20:35,746 --> 01:20:36,766
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that reminds me.

936
01:20:36,907 --> 01:20:43,149
[SPEAKER_04]: I have news for you because you were wanting me to come to the Digital Life Expo and you're actually not the only person on the East Coast who wanted me to come out there.

937
01:20:44,810 --> 01:20:49,512
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm having a meeting with my boss next week to negotiate trying to get the time off to make that happen.

938
01:20:49,652 --> 01:20:51,633
[SPEAKER_04]: I already have a place to stay if I come out there, so...

939
01:20:53,190 --> 01:20:54,392
[SPEAKER_04]: The plan is being set in motion.

940
01:20:54,452 --> 01:20:55,292
[SPEAKER_04]: I was serious last week.

941
01:20:55,333 --> 01:20:56,334
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to try and make it happen.

942
01:20:56,494 --> 01:20:57,595
[SPEAKER_04]: So, we'll see.

943
01:20:57,995 --> 01:21:08,987
[SPEAKER_08]: It all depends on... If anything, if you're still having problems with like, you know, finding a place to stay for other people, there's this cat named, you know, Sketch on the New York forums.

944
01:21:09,167 --> 01:21:15,253
[SPEAKER_08]: He's usually very... He usually offers his apartment for people who are actually going to be in the tournament.

945
01:21:15,293 --> 01:21:15,474
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

946
01:21:16,656 --> 01:21:26,878
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't take my word for... I mean, don't say I, you know, don't say I was, you know... Wait a minute, you... You want me to stay at the house of a complete internet stranger?

947
01:21:27,618 --> 01:21:30,979
[SPEAKER_08]: No, but I've already met him on... What if he rapes me or something?

948
01:21:30,999 --> 01:21:32,559
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be... You would feel bad.

949
01:21:33,399 --> 01:21:34,480
[SPEAKER_04]: You wouldn't feel anything.

950
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:36,060
[SPEAKER_08]: But he's very generous.

951
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:38,000
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm teasing, I'm teasing.

952
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:39,761
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure this guy's great.

953
01:21:39,901 --> 01:21:45,602
[SPEAKER_08]: It would just be like you sitting down... Expert, shut the hell up.

954
01:21:46,363 --> 01:21:53,272
[SPEAKER_08]: Beans, can you spill for us about any more Konami stuff that you might know that's unclassified?

955
01:21:54,333 --> 01:21:57,718
[SPEAKER_04]: Unclassified Konami stuff that you might know, Miklatov.

956
01:21:59,739 --> 01:22:02,340
[SPEAKER_03]: Put down Minios for one goddamn minute, Jesus.

957
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:03,641
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the demo.

958
01:22:04,901 --> 01:22:07,963
[SPEAKER_03]: Any unclassified Konami stuff that you can speak of.

959
01:22:08,083 --> 01:22:09,044
[SPEAKER_03]: Unclassified?

960
01:22:09,064 --> 01:22:12,245
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, things that won't get you fired for your NDA.

961
01:22:12,465 --> 01:22:16,648
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I take lunch at, like, between 1 and 3.

962
01:22:17,568 --> 01:22:18,809
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's not going to get me fired.

963
01:22:18,829 --> 01:22:20,450
[SPEAKER_08]: That's making sense besides you.

964
01:22:21,570 --> 01:22:21,850
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

965
01:22:22,371 --> 01:22:22,691
[SPEAKER_08]: What was that?

966
01:22:23,693 --> 01:22:25,435
[SPEAKER_08]: Who else is making steps beside you?

967
01:22:25,455 --> 01:22:27,657
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, you got to excuse the retainer.

968
01:22:27,858 --> 01:22:28,498
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you say that?

969
01:22:28,538 --> 01:22:30,701
[SPEAKER_08]: Who else is making steps beside you?

970
01:22:31,142 --> 01:22:41,254
[SPEAKER_07]: I won't name names, but if you look at the instruction booklet for Ultramix 2, the names pretty much haven't changed.

971
01:22:41,989 --> 01:22:43,270
[SPEAKER_08]: Extreme 2 Are the chefs going to be horrible?

972
01:23:00,959 --> 01:23:05,160
[SPEAKER_08]: I just hope they're challenging too, because I don't want to be forced to make an edit.

973
01:23:28,195 --> 01:23:30,537
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, nobody's forcing you.

974
01:23:30,577 --> 01:23:36,042
[SPEAKER_07]: You could go play in the groove, and then you could use your hands and your feet and your butt and your head and your neighbor.

975
01:23:36,503 --> 01:23:39,726
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, now, now, if you want some additional... Just so you can hit all the arrows.

976
01:23:40,046 --> 01:23:43,069
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait for the game to come out, Taku, then you can start the shit-talking.

977
01:23:43,109 --> 01:23:46,071
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want some hard stuff, you gotta play the eye-tway stuff.

978
01:23:46,111 --> 01:23:47,353
[SPEAKER_02]: Hands and feet mode is where it's...

979
01:23:48,673 --> 01:23:50,694
[SPEAKER_08]: I've done enough.

980
01:23:51,094 --> 01:23:57,357
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I've injured my hand just playing in the groove trying to do the holds.

981
01:23:57,897 --> 01:23:59,098
[SPEAKER_08]: I got a little bruised.

982
01:24:09,511 --> 01:24:11,651
[SPEAKER_04]: a wee bit of a letdown for some fans.

983
01:24:11,691 --> 01:24:13,052
[SPEAKER_08]: It was just crap, that's it.

984
01:24:13,112 --> 01:24:15,232
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, Xtreme was good.

985
01:24:15,252 --> 01:24:17,733
[SPEAKER_08]: Most of the sets to the licenses were crap.

986
01:24:17,853 --> 01:24:18,913
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on, Zaku, don't interrupt me.

987
01:24:19,053 --> 01:24:20,293
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, don't interrupt me.

988
01:24:21,914 --> 01:24:26,595
[SPEAKER_04]: Does Xtreme 2 make up for the things that tick people off about Xtreme 1?

989
01:24:26,915 --> 01:24:29,475
[SPEAKER_07]: First of all, I think those people are whiners.

990
01:24:29,755 --> 01:24:33,716
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no reason that I thought they were decent steps.

991
01:24:33,736 --> 01:24:34,416
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait a minute, though.

992
01:24:34,616 --> 01:24:38,457
[SPEAKER_08]: The fact that Konami held back, you know, on Xtreme, they held back...

993
01:24:38,837 --> 01:24:41,618
[SPEAKER_04]: Zaku, I will hang up on you.

994
01:24:42,418 --> 01:24:43,558
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on, I'll get back to you in a minute.

995
01:24:43,599 --> 01:24:46,799
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, which was the better game last year, Ultramix 2 or Extreme?

996
01:24:46,819 --> 01:24:48,100
[SPEAKER_04]: Ultramix 2, everybody knows that.

997
01:24:48,240 --> 01:24:49,440
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, well then there you go.

998
01:24:49,500 --> 01:24:55,122
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just defending Extreme, because people belittle it because it wasn't the Japanese one.

999
01:24:55,462 --> 01:24:58,223
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god, the steps are too easy because they're not 12s.

1000
01:24:58,483 --> 01:25:03,104
[SPEAKER_04]: I think people were a little harsh on Extreme, but it did have its issues.

1001
01:25:03,124 --> 01:25:04,265
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I know, I know.

1002
01:25:04,285 --> 01:25:05,385
[SPEAKER_04]: Maximizer was cool.

1003
01:25:08,510 --> 01:25:11,271
[SPEAKER_04]: Interface, we all know that that's better now.

1004
01:25:11,751 --> 01:25:22,295
[SPEAKER_04]: Songlist, we've seen hecka more transplants from Xtreme, like, you know, Irresistible Man, La Copa De Vida, all those Xtreme songs you wanted are in Xtreme 2.

1005
01:25:22,395 --> 01:25:23,516
[SPEAKER_04]: Cartoon Heroes, hello.

1006
01:25:25,677 --> 01:25:30,158
[SPEAKER_08]: The fact that they nailed, you know, they nailed Silence was pretty much it.

1007
01:25:30,999 --> 01:25:31,799
[SPEAKER_08]: Your phone's ringing.

1008
01:25:32,572 --> 01:25:35,474
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I know, so I'm going to wrap this up right now.

1009
01:25:35,814 --> 01:25:40,517
[SPEAKER_08]: Bottom line is this, I just hope Xtreme 2 is a lot better than Xtreme.

1010
01:25:40,598 --> 01:25:40,898
[SPEAKER_04]: It is.

1011
01:25:40,938 --> 01:25:41,658
[SPEAKER_04]: Duly noted.

1012
01:25:41,758 --> 01:25:43,820
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got to get this call.

1013
01:25:44,140 --> 01:25:45,521
[SPEAKER_04]: Take care, Cool Cat.

1014
01:25:48,983 --> 01:25:49,364
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1015
01:25:50,484 --> 01:25:51,865
[SPEAKER_04]: Go get that phone, don't be rude.

1016
01:25:52,746 --> 01:25:55,648
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, I'm trying to read what's going on in the chat room here.

1017
01:25:55,708 --> 01:25:55,908
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1018
01:26:00,745 --> 01:26:03,407
[SPEAKER_02]: Are the steps going to still suck because you're working on them?

1019
01:26:04,907 --> 01:26:09,110
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, burn, yeah.

1020
01:26:09,170 --> 01:26:13,772
[SPEAKER_07]: I have stuff I wasn't proud of in 2, and I have stuff I'm not proud of in other things.

1021
01:26:13,832 --> 01:26:21,456
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as Konami of Hawaii can learn how to cut songs, you know, actually be able to edit them like, I don't know, Skulk, for example...

1022
01:26:22,546 --> 01:26:32,697
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, as much as I thought I hated the edit for Skulk, I don't mind it anymore because there's... I don't think I'd want to be dancing to... Dancing?

1023
01:26:33,338 --> 01:26:38,183
[SPEAKER_07]: Stepping on arrows to the part where he sings a lot, just because I don't think it would be that fun.

1024
01:26:38,684 --> 01:26:40,966
[SPEAKER_07]: Granted, it was the same thing over and over again for the first episode.

1025
01:26:40,986 --> 01:26:42,267
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the cut of Skulk, so you shut up.

1026
01:26:42,908 --> 01:26:43,108
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1027
01:26:45,244 --> 01:26:46,665
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn, now I forgot the question I was going to ask.

1028
01:26:46,685 --> 01:26:47,925
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what it was either.

1029
01:26:47,966 --> 01:26:49,226
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it Meteos related?

1030
01:26:49,246 --> 01:26:49,987
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that's what I'm doing.

1031
01:26:50,027 --> 01:26:51,708
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's not Meteos related.

1032
01:26:51,748 --> 01:26:52,589
[SPEAKER_04]: It's back on Extreme.

1033
01:26:52,609 --> 01:26:54,070
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry to make you talk about work.

1034
01:26:54,470 --> 01:26:56,972
[SPEAKER_04]: At least I'm not asking you about you know what.

1035
01:26:58,853 --> 01:27:01,615
[SPEAKER_04]: What was I going to say about Extreme?

1036
01:27:01,755 --> 01:27:05,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I don't know if you can answer this, so feel free to tell me you can't if you can't.

1037
01:27:06,378 --> 01:27:12,863
[SPEAKER_04]: But we all know one of the reasons why people loved Ultramix 2 is because

1038
01:27:13,561 --> 01:27:19,215
[SPEAKER_04]: DDR fans like yourself and other DDR fans who now work for Konami were responsible for the steps.

1039
01:27:20,117 --> 01:27:21,962
[SPEAKER_04]: Extreme USA didn't have that.

1040
01:27:23,376 --> 01:27:28,019
[SPEAKER_04]: Does Xtreme 2, now we all are assuming Ultramix 3 has it because you all worked on Ultramix before.

1041
01:27:28,359 --> 01:27:32,102
[SPEAKER_04]: Does Xtreme 2 now have the influence of those same DDR fans?

1042
01:27:32,222 --> 01:27:33,243
[SPEAKER_04]: I really can't say.

1043
01:27:33,883 --> 01:27:34,403
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew that.

1044
01:27:34,644 --> 01:27:36,385
[SPEAKER_04]: You just wanted to go back to Meteor pretty much.

1045
01:27:36,405 --> 01:27:40,227
[SPEAKER_02]: So online stuff, are we going to, you know, is online going to be like pretty neat?

1046
01:27:40,307 --> 01:27:46,011
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they going to do the same stuff they did with Ultramix 2 with Xtreme 2?

1047
01:27:46,291 --> 01:27:47,192
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't say.

1048
01:27:47,332 --> 01:27:49,814
[SPEAKER_07]: If it's not been in the press release, I really can't say anything about that.

1049
01:27:49,834 --> 01:27:51,095
[SPEAKER_02]: It has been in the press release.

1050
01:27:51,135 --> 01:27:52,055
[SPEAKER_02]: I just can't remember it.

1051
01:27:53,776 --> 01:27:54,377
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

1052
01:28:23,570 --> 01:28:24,771
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't see any more calls coming in.

1053
01:28:24,871 --> 01:28:27,233
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, you know, you could also go to MobyGames.com.

1054
01:28:28,234 --> 01:28:31,617
[SPEAKER_07]: Credits for Ultra Mix 2 are listed there to see who worked on it.

1055
01:28:31,737 --> 01:28:36,021
[SPEAKER_07]: If you don't actually have Ultra Mix 2, which if you don't, well, you're stupid.

1056
01:28:36,662 --> 01:28:38,944
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was like five bucks at Walmart a couple weeks ago.

1057
01:28:39,004 --> 01:28:40,165
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw some thread on DDR Free.

1058
01:28:40,205 --> 01:28:41,686
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think that was a lie.

1059
01:28:42,407 --> 01:28:42,707
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it?

1060
01:28:42,767 --> 01:28:44,529
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that person was just stupid.

1061
01:28:44,729 --> 01:28:45,189
[SPEAKER_07]: Bastard.

1062
01:28:45,209 --> 01:28:46,971
[SPEAKER_07]: That's our most people on DDR Free.

1063
01:28:49,293 --> 01:28:50,314
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, watch it.

1064
01:28:50,994 --> 01:28:53,195
[SPEAKER_04]: I have friends who are at DDR Freak.

1065
01:28:53,215 --> 01:28:54,996
[SPEAKER_04]: They know I love them.

1066
01:28:55,136 --> 01:28:58,258
[SPEAKER_04]: We have our lovely rewinds we do over on DDR Freak on Friday nights.

1067
01:28:58,598 --> 01:28:59,859
[SPEAKER_07]: I forgot to pause Meteos.

1068
01:28:59,959 --> 01:29:00,559
[SPEAKER_07]: I died.

1069
01:29:02,220 --> 01:29:05,442
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what you get.

1070
01:29:06,382 --> 01:29:11,885
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously, this show is probably the most we've gotten out of Shane all year, and that's really not that much.

1071
01:29:12,265 --> 01:29:13,466
[SPEAKER_04]: It really hasn't been that much.

1072
01:29:14,466 --> 01:29:16,247
[SPEAKER_04]: We get more out of him if he is drunk.

1073
01:29:16,407 --> 01:29:16,928
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know.

1074
01:29:17,849 --> 01:29:18,712
[SPEAKER_04]: Anybody got some alcohol?

1075
01:29:19,636 --> 01:29:20,258
[SPEAKER_03]: John, you're here now.

1076
01:29:20,439 --> 01:29:21,303
[SPEAKER_03]: Go get him some alcohol.

1077
01:29:21,544 --> 01:29:22,668
[SPEAKER_03]: John's gonna go get him some alcohol.

1078
01:29:24,386 --> 01:29:26,107
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not drinking tonight.

1079
01:29:26,547 --> 01:29:27,688
[SPEAKER_07]: I have work tomorrow.

1080
01:29:28,248 --> 01:29:29,429
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be fine.

1081
01:29:30,230 --> 01:29:32,951
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'll punch somebody in the face if I'm hungover.

1082
01:29:32,991 --> 01:29:35,273
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't you say you were immune to alcohol now?

1083
01:29:36,694 --> 01:29:37,794
[SPEAKER_05]: I say we test it.

1084
01:29:38,015 --> 01:29:38,995
[SPEAKER_05]: I say we don't.

1085
01:29:39,476 --> 01:29:40,516
[SPEAKER_05]: I say we do.

1086
01:29:43,878 --> 01:29:46,240
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, see, I might have to throw up a lot or something.

1087
01:29:46,260 --> 01:29:46,820
[SPEAKER_04]: Hurry up and call.

1088
01:29:46,860 --> 01:29:50,402
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're thinking about calling, now is a good time to call because we're moving on.

1160
01:36:13,368 --> 01:36:14,749

[SPEAKER_04]: That was Cold Storage with Onyx.

1166
01:38:30,525 --> 01:38:32,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Will it win for another week in a row?

1167
01:38:32,427 --> 01:38:33,088
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll find out.

1168
01:38:33,108 --> 01:38:36,571
[SPEAKER_04]: But first, we have to put it up against two brand new songs.

1169
01:38:36,952 --> 01:38:39,614
[SPEAKER_04]: So the second song in tonight's cage match is going to be my pick.

1170
01:38:40,195 --> 01:38:45,540
[SPEAKER_04]: And you guys remember DJ Sammy, he was really huge a couple years ago with that song Heaven, you know.

1171
01:38:50,231 --> 01:38:55,674
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was in DDR Extreme, DDR Max 2 and everything, so I know you guys know it.

1172
01:38:56,114 --> 01:38:59,376
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, he has a brand new single out, brand, brand new single, and it's another cover.

1173
01:39:00,036 --> 01:39:02,658
[SPEAKER_04]: So guess what song he decided to take a spin on this time.

1174
01:39:02,698 --> 01:39:04,239
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually an old Annie Lennox song.

1175
01:39:04,899 --> 01:39:08,461
[SPEAKER_04]: It's his version of Why, and it's my pick for tonight's Cage Match, song number two.

1176
01:40:21,990 --> 01:40:24,296
Thanks for watching!

1177
01:41:25,491 --> 01:41:27,516
Thanks for watching!

1178
01:42:01,744 --> 01:42:02,425
Thanks for watching!

1179
01:43:10,020 --> 01:43:10,481
[SPEAKER_04]: Y by DJ Sammy

1180
01:43:22,819 --> 01:43:23,579
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?

1181
01:43:25,380 --> 01:43:32,363
[SPEAKER_02]: The part where she's doing the ad-lib vocal stuff, not the refrain.

1182
01:43:32,383 --> 01:43:33,123
[SPEAKER_02]: Where she's rapping?

1183
01:43:33,863 --> 01:43:35,344
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorta, I guess, rapping.

1184
01:43:35,424 --> 01:43:37,625
[SPEAKER_02]: That just totally did not work at all.

1185
01:43:37,925 --> 01:43:40,566
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really bad in that sense.

1186
01:43:41,586 --> 01:43:45,588
[SPEAKER_02]: And DJ Sammy needs to make some new songs that are not covers.

1187
01:43:46,474 --> 01:43:48,335
[SPEAKER_02]: Please, please, please.

1188
01:43:48,616 --> 01:43:50,277
[SPEAKER_02]: Or pick some better 80s stuff.

1189
01:43:50,317 --> 01:43:51,958
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's plenty of songs out there, you know.

1190
01:43:52,198 --> 01:43:54,480
[SPEAKER_02]: Personally, I like, you know, West End Girls.

1191
01:43:54,520 --> 01:43:55,441
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's a good song.

1192
01:43:55,481 --> 01:43:57,302
[SPEAKER_02]: They did a really cool breakbeat version of it.

1193
01:43:58,583 --> 01:43:58,883
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

1194
01:43:59,224 --> 01:44:01,706
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, that wasn't quite awesome.

1195
01:44:01,746 --> 01:44:02,826
[SPEAKER_02]: It was about 7.

1196
01:44:03,927 --> 01:44:04,287
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1197
01:44:05,148 --> 01:44:06,849
[SPEAKER_04]: Miklatov, what did you think of that one?

1198
01:44:07,530 --> 01:44:08,290
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got his own mic.

1199
01:44:08,631 --> 01:44:09,531
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, hand him that one, that one.

1200
01:44:10,312 --> 01:44:10,392
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

1201
01:44:12,307 --> 01:44:16,250
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I didn't really care for this song because I was playing Meteos.

1202
01:44:19,151 --> 01:44:26,536
[SPEAKER_07]: I still, I heard it though earlier today and it's okay, but I, oh crap, I forgot to pause.

1203
01:44:29,198 --> 01:44:29,998
[SPEAKER_07]: I give it a four.

1204
01:44:30,018 --> 01:44:33,360
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, Justin.

1205
01:44:34,221 --> 01:44:40,645
[SPEAKER_09]: I give it a six because like Loki, I really was not digging the part where she was just kind of talking the song and not

1206
01:44:41,444 --> 01:44:51,986
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't even like Annie Lennox that much.

1207
01:44:52,366 --> 01:44:55,867
[SPEAKER_05]: She's like a weird fucking red-headed bitch.

1208
01:44:56,947 --> 01:44:58,067
[SPEAKER_05]: But she's British!

1209
01:44:58,187 --> 01:44:59,167
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought you liked that!

1210
01:45:00,848 --> 01:45:08,809
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I like Imogen Heap because she's cool and British, but Annie Lennox is weird.

1211
01:45:10,027 --> 01:45:13,528
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, like, I didn't like the original song, so I didn't care for this one either.

1212
01:45:14,328 --> 01:45:15,209
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a scale of 1 to 10?

1213
01:45:15,329 --> 01:45:16,269
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that what it is?

1214
01:45:16,509 --> 01:45:16,729
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes.

1215
01:45:17,089 --> 01:45:17,329
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, 1.

1216
01:45:18,870 --> 01:45:19,350
[SPEAKER_24]: John!

1217
01:45:20,010 --> 01:45:21,711
[SPEAKER_24]: For your debut on the show, John.

1218
01:45:22,211 --> 01:45:23,331
[SPEAKER_24]: Wow, this is kind of scary.

1219
01:45:23,692 --> 01:45:24,292
[SPEAKER_24]: What'd you think?

1220
01:45:24,872 --> 01:45:26,372
[SPEAKER_24]: I was kind of bored with it, to be honest.

1221
01:45:26,392 --> 01:45:27,193
[SPEAKER_24]: I give it a 3.

1222
01:45:27,973 --> 01:45:28,233
[SPEAKER_24]: Alright.

1223
01:45:28,866 --> 01:45:41,229
[SPEAKER_04]: And I give that song... I agree, the girl rapping was kind of weird, and it doesn't hold a candle to the Annie Lennox original, but it makes me think about the Annie Lennox original and why I love that red-headed bitch from the Eurythmics.

1224
01:45:41,629 --> 01:45:43,329
[SPEAKER_04]: So I give it a 20.

1225
01:45:44,250 --> 01:45:47,010
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's go to the next song.

1226
01:45:47,490 --> 01:45:50,031
[SPEAKER_05]: This is... You're a red-headed bitch, that's why.

1227
01:45:51,280 --> 01:45:53,161
[SPEAKER_04]: This is DarkSakura's pick.

1228
01:45:53,221 --> 01:45:54,682
[SPEAKER_04]: She put a song in tonight's cage match.

1229
01:45:54,742 --> 01:45:57,464
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though she's not here tonight, she's actually in chat.

1230
01:45:57,504 --> 01:46:00,045
[SPEAKER_04]: She just joined the chat room, so you guys can say hi to her over there.

1231
01:46:00,466 --> 01:46:03,147
[SPEAKER_04]: I think she'll be here in a little while before podcast.

1232
01:46:03,167 --> 01:46:04,288
[SPEAKER_04]: I think she's supposed to be anyway.

1233
01:46:04,568 --> 01:46:04,928
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

1234
01:46:05,369 --> 01:46:07,130
[SPEAKER_04]: But she put this song in for you guys.

1235
01:46:07,690 --> 01:46:08,851
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an old favorite.

1236
01:46:09,691 --> 01:46:14,294
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Hamasaki Ayumi with Fly High.

1237
01:46:14,394 --> 01:46:16,536
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's Hal's 2000 mix.

1238
01:46:19,448 --> 01:46:24,190
[SPEAKER_04]: So here it is, you know her, Ayumi Hamasaki, what?

1239
01:46:24,971 --> 01:46:26,871
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you shaking your head for over there, Loki?

1240
01:46:28,112 --> 01:46:29,113
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's play the song!

1241
01:46:30,753 --> 01:46:32,014
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, here we go.

1242
01:46:33,395 --> 01:46:36,296
[SPEAKER_04]: Ayumi Hamasaki, Fly High, Hal's 2000 Mix, here it is.

1243
01:46:59,182 --> 01:47:00,364
[SPEAKER_13]: and the rest of the band.

1244
01:47:27,486 --> 01:47:28,446
Thank you for watching!

1245
01:48:06,844 --> 01:48:07,190
and many more.

1246
01:48:39,162 --> 01:48:40,823
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for watching!

1247
01:49:33,891 --> 01:49:35,058
Thank you for watching

1248
01:50:54,233 --> 01:51:00,161
[SPEAKER_04]: Alrighty, that was song number three, Ayumi, the one and only, with Fly High, Hal's 2000 mix.

1249
01:51:00,241 --> 01:51:07,550
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go around and see, on a scale of one to ten, where that song lies for the folks in our studio right now.

1250
01:51:07,730 --> 01:51:07,991
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

1251
01:51:08,011 --> 01:51:08,091
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

1252
01:51:08,442 --> 01:51:13,084
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I want to start off by saying that it was generic trance, but, um... You're gonna get punched next week.

1253
01:51:13,104 --> 01:51:14,004
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know what?

1254
01:51:14,724 --> 01:51:17,945
[SPEAKER_02]: That was just a clusterfuck of... No!

1255
01:51:18,345 --> 01:51:18,846
[SPEAKER_02]: No!

1256
01:51:19,146 --> 01:51:19,426
[SPEAKER_02]: No!

1257
01:51:19,526 --> 01:51:20,866
[SPEAKER_02]: Bad song.

1258
01:51:21,046 --> 01:51:21,947
[SPEAKER_02]: Bad.

1259
01:51:22,307 --> 01:51:23,007
[SPEAKER_02]: Bad.

1260
01:51:23,467 --> 01:51:23,927
[SPEAKER_02]: Bad song.

1261
01:51:24,748 --> 01:51:24,868
[SPEAKER_02]: One.

1262
01:51:25,088 --> 01:51:25,488
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

1263
01:51:25,588 --> 01:51:26,448
[SPEAKER_02]: It was awful.

1264
01:51:26,548 --> 01:51:29,229
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I thought it was gonna end, and I was like, oh, thank God.

1265
01:51:29,749 --> 01:51:31,210
[SPEAKER_02]: It came back, and I was like, no!

1266
01:51:32,455 --> 01:51:33,256
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, very, very bad.

1267
01:51:33,696 --> 01:51:38,380
[SPEAKER_04]: I, you know what, me personally, I don't get to go to the last, we gotta go in the same order.

1268
01:51:38,400 --> 01:51:39,741
[SPEAKER_04]: Shane, you're up next.

1269
01:51:40,741 --> 01:51:51,670
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, my first comment when that song was playing, and we didn't have microphones on, was, wow, I didn't know Inuyasha was over, because it sounds like an anime song that I don't care about.

1270
01:51:51,950 --> 01:52:01,778
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, one, because I don't understand the love of Japanese singers and how they're so cool, and Ayumi Hamasaki, and

1271
01:52:04,146 --> 01:52:04,986
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1272
01:52:05,046 --> 01:52:05,847
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let's see.

1273
01:52:05,967 --> 01:52:06,447
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's move on.

1274
01:52:06,467 --> 01:52:06,827
[SPEAKER_04]: Justin.

1275
01:52:08,567 --> 01:52:19,430
[SPEAKER_09]: Even though it was a complete clusterfuck of a different, like, it went through rap, it went through happy J-pop, it went through generic trance, and it went through hard trance, I still kind of liked it.

1276
01:52:19,990 --> 01:52:20,830
[SPEAKER_05]: So I give it a seven.

1277
01:52:21,090 --> 01:52:21,430
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1278
01:52:22,310 --> 01:52:22,890
[SPEAKER_09]: Extover.

1279
01:52:24,571 --> 01:52:25,671
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn those guild sellers.

1280
01:52:28,314 --> 01:52:29,515
[SPEAKER_05]: I got it right that time, right?

1281
01:52:29,555 --> 01:52:31,355
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you did, but that's not the topic.

1282
01:52:31,635 --> 01:52:33,015
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I'm sorry.

1283
01:52:33,536 --> 01:52:35,416
[SPEAKER_05]: The song was so boring, I forgot.

1284
01:52:35,896 --> 01:52:41,758
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, no, I love Jamie, so I'm going to give it a five just for that.

1285
01:52:42,198 --> 01:52:42,538
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

1286
01:52:43,398 --> 01:52:43,838
[SPEAKER_24]: John.

1287
01:52:45,038 --> 01:52:47,039
[SPEAKER_24]: I'll just say that Loki's song was my favorite.

1288
01:52:48,019 --> 01:52:50,200
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, okay.

1289
01:52:50,220 --> 01:52:51,680
[SPEAKER_24]: That's not a number on a scale of one to ten.

1290
01:52:52,644 --> 01:52:54,745
[SPEAKER_24]: DarkSakura is actually listening and she would like to say the following.

1291
01:52:54,765 --> 01:52:58,227
[SPEAKER_24]: Mine gets an 8 and not a 10 because it's still generic trance.

1292
01:53:10,031 --> 01:53:14,515
[SPEAKER_04]: So at least she's acknowledging that it's a wee bit of generic trance.

1293
01:53:14,695 --> 01:53:15,656
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

1294
01:53:15,676 --> 01:53:17,757
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my favorite Ayumi song, is Fly High.

1295
01:53:17,937 --> 01:53:19,358
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was pretty excited there.

1296
01:53:19,879 --> 01:53:26,424
[SPEAKER_04]: The only parts I didn't like about that song were the very beginning, and the very end, and the middle.

1297
01:53:26,644 --> 01:53:27,025
[SPEAKER_04]: But like...

1298
01:53:29,304 --> 01:53:36,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Not everything in the middle, like the rap in the middle I didn't like, but I liked the first two minutes around the beginning, and I liked the last two minutes after the rap.

1299
01:53:37,266 --> 01:53:41,047
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we could cut, like crop the song, it would be really, really good.

1300
01:53:41,448 --> 01:53:43,648
[SPEAKER_04]: But because it's not cropped, I have to give it a 7.

1301
01:53:44,028 --> 01:53:46,569
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Loki, you have a...

1302
01:53:46,917 --> 01:53:49,699
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounded like the end of a 2DX song.

1303
01:53:49,880 --> 01:53:52,602
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't think for the life of me which song... Big Voyager.

1304
01:53:52,722 --> 01:53:53,843
[SPEAKER_02]: Big Voyager, okay.

1305
01:53:53,943 --> 01:53:58,367
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, completely ripped those public... I'm sure they're royalty-free samples.

1306
01:53:58,387 --> 01:54:02,130
[SPEAKER_02]: They're available on some CDs somewhere because everybody uses them.

1307
01:54:02,870 --> 01:54:04,192
[SPEAKER_02]: I have some of them, so I know.

1308
01:54:05,072 --> 01:54:07,214
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, kids.

1309
01:54:07,274 --> 01:54:08,415
[SPEAKER_04]: Get ready to place those votes.

1310
01:54:08,455 --> 01:54:11,658
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's a recap of the three songs you can vote for in tonight's cage match.

1311
01:54:11,718 --> 01:54:15,181
[SPEAKER_04]: Song number one is Cold Storage with Onyx.

1312
01:54:23,270 --> 01:54:30,953
[SPEAKER_04]: And song number two you can vote for tonight is DJ Sammy with his Annie Lennox cover of Why.

1313
01:54:40,537 --> 01:54:47,040
[SPEAKER_04]: And song number three you can vote for tonight is Hamasaki Ayumi, Fly High, Howl's 2000 Mix.

1314
01:54:58,108 --> 01:55:00,631
[SPEAKER_04]: Place vote now.

1315
01:55:00,671 --> 01:55:02,153
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you like how I got the big Voyager clip in there?

1316
01:55:02,834 --> 01:55:04,517
[SPEAKER_04]: Place vote now.

1317
01:55:04,557 --> 01:55:08,382
[SPEAKER_04]: Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.

1318
01:55:09,144 --> 01:55:10,984
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie, I'm already going to tell you, your vote doesn't count.

1319
01:55:11,004 --> 01:55:11,685
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry to say.

1320
01:55:12,305 --> 01:55:12,625
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1321
01:55:12,965 --> 01:55:13,445
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

1322
01:55:13,605 --> 01:55:23,407
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of reminded me, like, parts of that Ayumi song reminded me of, like, a Max Ayumi or something like that, you know, because they have the clips of, like, some hard techno stuff, and then it went back into Ayumi.

1323
01:55:23,427 --> 01:55:24,448
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just kind of weird.

1324
01:55:24,908 --> 01:55:26,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was interesting.

1325
01:55:26,208 --> 01:55:26,688
[SPEAKER_02]: It was interesting.

1326
01:55:26,708 --> 01:55:27,348
[SPEAKER_04]: It was interesting.

1327
01:55:28,208 --> 01:55:31,949
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, this is the part of the show where I let Loki talk about what's going on in the sim scene.

1328
01:55:32,970 --> 01:55:38,131
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm sure there's something going on at Tourney Mix 6, but I haven't checked, so it's going on.

1329
01:55:39,574 --> 01:56:09,126
[SPEAKER_02]: then there's also the important thing because we're talking about quality sim files now is actually FoonMix 2 they have a date for it now when it's going to be coming out September 15th and they've announced some of the compilations they're going to be pulling from from you know diverse system stuff to Silly Walker stuff and they're basically I think they mentioned like D7 which was some really good stuff in there and then some of the Silly Walker Gotta Mix 3 or something like that

1330
01:56:10,149 --> 01:56:11,029
[SPEAKER_02]: Really good songs.

1331
01:56:11,150 --> 01:56:12,311
[SPEAKER_02]: So, it'll be interesting.

1332
01:56:12,331 --> 01:56:14,012
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they said over 50 songs.

1333
01:56:14,893 --> 01:56:15,394
[SPEAKER_02]: 50 new songs.

1334
01:56:15,514 --> 01:56:17,355
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I can't wait.

1335
01:56:17,976 --> 01:56:21,880
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks to be fun and we'll have to check it out on the 15th.

1336
01:56:23,381 --> 01:56:23,581
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1337
01:56:24,842 --> 01:56:27,025
[SPEAKER_04]: Justin, I know you follow the sim scene a little bit too.

1338
01:56:27,085 --> 01:56:28,066
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there anything you want to add?

1339
01:56:28,106 --> 01:56:29,267
[SPEAKER_04]: Because Loki tends to miss things.

1340
01:56:29,707 --> 01:56:29,927
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1341
01:56:31,521 --> 01:56:39,124
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, one of my favorite personal Simphile authors, the DWI Extreme series just released one of their new mixes too.

1342
01:56:39,184 --> 01:56:42,646
[SPEAKER_09]: It was DWI Extreme Glistening to Infinity.

1343
01:56:43,486 --> 01:56:47,148
[SPEAKER_09]: Lame name, I know, but it was actually a really good mix of songs.

1344
01:56:47,168 --> 01:56:54,431
[SPEAKER_09]: They had some Latin songs, they had a bunch of R&B and dance songs, and it's actually a really good mix.

1345
01:56:55,171 --> 01:57:00,253
[SPEAKER_09]: But the thing is, for this specific release, they're actually making it

1346
01:57:01,172 --> 01:57:01,993
[SPEAKER_09]: They're still dead.

1347
01:57:02,013 --> 01:57:02,413
[SPEAKER_09]: Who cares?

1348
01:57:02,433 --> 01:57:03,934
[SPEAKER_09]: Princess Diana is still dead.

1349
01:57:30,489 --> 01:57:31,610
[SPEAKER_04]: Just in case you're wondering.

1350
01:57:35,612 --> 01:57:36,472
[SPEAKER_02]: Princess Di.

1351
01:57:40,435 --> 01:57:41,175
[SPEAKER_04]: How rude.

1352
01:57:41,195 --> 01:57:52,722
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have loved to see, you know, the actual, you know how they always have those funny, witty, you know, subject lines, you know, they're always on the newspapers, you know, the wonderful headlines.

1353
01:57:53,222 --> 01:57:58,205
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish, you know, there was a newspaper that put Princess Di, you know, D-I-V, because that'd be funny.

1354
01:57:59,284 --> 01:58:01,705
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you might be really offending somebody who's listening tonight.

1355
01:58:02,145 --> 01:58:03,566
[SPEAKER_04]: But isn't that what we were good at doing?

1356
01:58:03,966 --> 01:58:09,109
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, if I'm offending Princess Di, then they shouldn't, you know... She's probably rolling in her grave.

1357
01:58:09,829 --> 01:58:11,030
[SPEAKER_02]: Hook her up to an alternator.

1358
01:58:11,910 --> 01:58:12,871
[SPEAKER_02]: Generate some power that way.

1359
01:58:17,053 --> 01:58:18,654
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's change the subject, shall we?

1360
01:58:22,596 --> 01:58:26,598
[SPEAKER_04]: Some folks still wanted to call in on our Skype line.

1361
01:58:28,459 --> 01:58:30,400
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to go ahead and open the Skype line back up.

1362
01:58:30,440 --> 01:58:33,401
[SPEAKER_04]: It's available at www.OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

1363
01:58:34,201 --> 01:58:40,603
[SPEAKER_04]: Click on Interact With Us, and you too can join in on the fun here on OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

1364
01:58:40,924 --> 01:58:44,425
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to give them just a couple minutes to get in.

1365
01:58:44,465 --> 01:58:46,546
[SPEAKER_04]: Now's your chance on the Skype line.

1366
01:58:46,966 --> 01:58:52,508
[SPEAKER_04]: In the meantime, I wanted to mention this because Rini linked me to this.

1367
01:58:52,628 --> 01:58:54,348
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on, our caller's having problems getting in.

1368
01:58:55,729 --> 01:58:55,929
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1369
01:58:57,526 --> 01:58:58,647
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple minutes to get in.

1370
01:58:58,687 --> 01:59:03,110
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds like, you know, Ann Nicole Smith boarding a plane, you know.

1371
01:59:03,170 --> 01:59:06,673
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like, come on, I'm ready for you.

1372
01:59:14,879 --> 01:59:26,869
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, I'm supposed to mention this thing that Rini linked me to, and I think this came off of the DDR Freak forum somehow, and it's basically the, or it's actually linked to on

1373
01:59:28,376 --> 01:59:31,418
[SPEAKER_04]: Konami of USA's website for Extreme 2.

1374
01:59:31,939 --> 01:59:35,321
[SPEAKER_04]: There's actually an online user agreement and you can read all these details.

1375
01:59:35,361 --> 01:59:38,063
[SPEAKER_04]: It's basically the blah blah blah blah blahs about the game.

1376
01:59:38,543 --> 01:59:50,412
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, somewhere in here it mentions in the blah blah blah something about this online game does not have any automatic save feature and therefore will ask you to save your information to a memory card or hard disk drive.

1377
01:59:50,932 --> 01:59:55,535
[SPEAKER_04]: So people are saying like, OMG, this game might have a hard disk drive support on it.

1378
01:59:56,156 --> 01:59:56,336
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

1379
01:59:57,344 --> 01:59:57,684
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1380
01:59:58,044 --> 02:00:05,168
[SPEAKER_04]: I tend to think this is just some generic agreement that happens to have Konami's name inserted in there.

1381
02:00:05,389 --> 02:00:05,869
[SPEAKER_04]: But we'll see.

1382
02:00:05,969 --> 02:00:09,491
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, turn down your speakers, buddy, and you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1383
02:00:09,911 --> 02:00:11,532
[SPEAKER_23]: Yo, Sky, what's up?

1384
02:00:12,092 --> 02:00:12,573
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, who's this?

1385
02:00:12,833 --> 02:00:13,273
[SPEAKER_23]: Hey, who's this?

1386
02:00:13,933 --> 02:00:14,714
[SPEAKER_23]: It's Kuwabara.

1387
02:00:15,434 --> 02:00:16,335
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, Kuwabara.

1388
02:00:16,415 --> 02:00:17,555
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm hearing myself.

1389
02:00:17,696 --> 02:00:20,317
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you turn down your speakers or move the headphones or something?

1390
02:00:20,417 --> 02:00:23,119
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, sorry, it's a built-in mic.

1391
02:00:23,439 --> 02:00:24,179
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm actually fine.

1392
02:00:24,599 --> 02:00:25,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's all right.

1393
02:00:26,277 --> 02:00:30,079
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, give us your thought, because I'm hearing myself, so give us your thought and then we'll respond to it.

1394
02:00:30,099 --> 02:00:32,420
[SPEAKER_23]: Thought on what?

1395
02:00:33,460 --> 02:00:34,361
[SPEAKER_04]: Why you're calling in tonight.

1396
02:00:35,841 --> 02:00:39,103
[SPEAKER_23]: I just wanted to call in just to, you know, talk about stuff.

1397
02:00:39,163 --> 02:00:40,643
[SPEAKER_23]: I really like 2DX and stuff.

1398
02:00:41,224 --> 02:00:44,445
[SPEAKER_23]: Just because, you know, I want to change the subject from ITG and DDR.

1399
02:00:44,525 --> 02:00:46,326
[SPEAKER_23]: It's starting to piss me off.

1400
02:00:46,786 --> 02:00:52,329
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, well, what is it you want to say that's not ITG DDR related?

1401
02:00:52,349 --> 02:00:52,929
[SPEAKER_23]: DDR related.

1402
02:00:54,721 --> 02:00:56,082
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't know, I really love Noria.

1403
02:00:57,983 --> 02:00:59,224
[SPEAKER_23]: You love what?

1404
02:00:59,665 --> 02:01:01,045
[SPEAKER_04]: Noria.

1405
02:01:01,286 --> 02:01:01,846
[SPEAKER_04]: Noria?

1406
02:01:02,006 --> 02:01:03,207
[SPEAKER_04]: That's 2DX related.

1407
02:01:03,847 --> 02:01:04,868
[SPEAKER_04]: Extifer?

1408
02:01:05,568 --> 02:01:05,969
[SPEAKER_04]: Echo.

1409
02:01:06,909 --> 02:01:11,532
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop it!

1410
02:01:11,873 --> 02:01:13,974
[SPEAKER_04]: I played a Noria song for you last break.

1411
02:01:13,994 --> 02:01:16,536
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, I know, that was really nice of you.

1412
02:01:16,716 --> 02:01:17,756
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, no problem.

1413
02:01:17,997 --> 02:01:19,718
[SPEAKER_23]: What's the thing you like most about 2DX?

1414
02:01:21,499 --> 02:01:23,120
[SPEAKER_23]: I like 2DX because of the key sounds.

1415
02:01:24,090 --> 02:01:24,811
[SPEAKER_04]: The Key Sounds

1416
02:01:54,454 --> 02:01:55,857
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh wait, can you say that?

1417
02:01:56,097 --> 02:01:58,982
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, never mind, okay.

1418
02:01:59,303 --> 02:02:02,048
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's our turn, dammit!

1419
02:02:05,054 --> 02:02:05,634
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, Miko, what's up?

1420
02:02:05,654 --> 02:02:05,895
[SPEAKER_04]: Hurry up.

1421
02:02:06,035 --> 02:02:06,395
[SPEAKER_15]: Miko, what's up?

1422
02:02:06,415 --> 02:02:06,615
[SPEAKER_15]: Hurry up.

1423
02:02:06,795 --> 02:02:08,316
[SPEAKER_04]: Who says they're... Oh, crap!

1424
02:02:08,336 --> 02:02:08,997
[SPEAKER_04]: That's loud!

1425
02:02:09,337 --> 02:02:09,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

1426
02:02:10,257 --> 02:02:11,538
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I'll talk really quietly.

1427
02:02:11,938 --> 02:02:16,581
[SPEAKER_06]: Who said that they're delaying TempStyle because of Beatmania US?

1428
02:02:16,962 --> 02:02:21,144
[SPEAKER_23]: Uh, I just thought it up because, uh, you know, it makes sense, doesn't it?

1429
02:02:21,425 --> 02:02:23,206
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, don't listen to your brain.

1430
02:02:24,627 --> 02:02:27,048
[SPEAKER_23]: That's something Konami would do, though, wouldn't it?

1431
02:02:27,068 --> 02:02:28,009
[SPEAKER_23]: I mean, it just makes sense.

1432
02:02:28,389 --> 02:02:29,290
[SPEAKER_06]: Why would they do that?

1433
02:02:29,310 --> 02:02:30,631
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they got a lot of people working there.

1434
02:02:30,671 --> 02:02:31,831
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not a nice thing.

1435
02:02:31,851 --> 02:02:32,632
[SPEAKER_23]: That's not a nice thing.

1436
02:02:33,703 --> 02:02:34,423
[SPEAKER_02]: Nami's nice.

1437
02:02:35,404 --> 02:02:37,685
[SPEAKER_02]: Besides, they're working on, they have, you know, the U.S.

1438
02:02:37,765 --> 02:02:39,706
[SPEAKER_02]: offices to work on Beatmania U.S.

1439
02:02:39,766 --> 02:02:42,948
[SPEAKER_02]: and then you have the Japanese offices to work on Beatmania 2DX.

1440
02:02:44,189 --> 02:02:48,191
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't actually think that's how it's working, but I don't think they're delaying anything.

1441
02:02:48,211 --> 02:02:49,452
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't listen to your brain, you know.

1442
02:02:49,512 --> 02:02:51,513
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, that's right.

1443
02:02:51,813 --> 02:02:56,916
[SPEAKER_04]: Kuwabara, I'm going to go ahead and let you go because we're getting too much of that echo, but thank you for calling in and have a great day, okay?

1444
02:02:57,036 --> 02:02:57,256
[SPEAKER_04]: Echo.

1445
02:02:57,276 --> 02:02:58,677
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, later.

1446
02:02:59,881 --> 02:03:02,043
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so Skypline's still open.

1447
02:03:02,243 --> 02:03:04,445
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, who's probably ticked off on me, but that's alright.

1448
02:03:04,985 --> 02:03:06,587
[SPEAKER_04]: That guy got in first, what can I say?

1449
02:03:06,647 --> 02:03:09,849
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you know what it's like to be one of our listeners, trying to get in on the Skypline.

1450
02:03:10,030 --> 02:03:13,112
[SPEAKER_06]: If we took a picture just then, we would have an echo image.

1451
02:03:15,614 --> 02:03:17,076
[SPEAKER_03]: OMG, was that a hint?

1452
02:03:17,556 --> 02:03:18,597
[SPEAKER_03]: OMG, was that a clue?

1453
02:03:19,097 --> 02:03:19,638
[SPEAKER_03]: Was that a clue?

1454
02:03:19,658 --> 02:03:20,939
[SPEAKER_03]: Go back to the freak board.

1455
02:03:24,722 --> 02:03:24,982
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1456
02:03:26,483 --> 02:03:28,165
[SPEAKER_04]: So, just because TenStyle

1457
02:03:28,923 --> 02:03:36,364
[SPEAKER_04]: is, um, or I'm sorry, just because, I'm sorry, just because Beatmania US is being worked on doesn't mean that TenStyle is not being worked on.

1458
02:03:36,424 --> 02:03:46,726
[SPEAKER_07]: And it hasn't even been announced yet, so who knows if they're actually even doing it, but the release of a US game would not stop the production of a Japanese game.

1459
02:03:46,906 --> 02:03:48,666
[SPEAKER_04]: From the man on the inside himself.

1460
02:03:48,746 --> 02:03:49,867
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, let's go to our Skype line.

1461
02:03:50,167 --> 02:03:51,087
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.

1462
02:03:53,967 --> 02:03:54,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello?

1463
02:03:54,427 --> 02:03:56,028
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, can you hear me?

1464
02:03:56,268 --> 02:03:56,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, now we can.

1465
02:03:57,128 --> 02:03:57,408
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up?

1466
02:03:59,879 --> 02:04:02,460
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my god, what a day.

1467
02:04:03,100 --> 02:04:06,941
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the one and only DarkSakura, for those that may not recognize the voice.

1468
02:04:06,961 --> 02:04:08,501
[SPEAKER_04]: This is DarkSakura, ladies and gentlemen.

1469
02:04:09,762 --> 02:04:10,802
[SPEAKER_01]: You too, say hi.

1470
02:04:11,382 --> 02:04:11,742
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.

1471
02:04:12,523 --> 02:04:12,703
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.

1472
02:04:13,323 --> 02:04:14,363
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, Dan.

1473
02:04:14,523 --> 02:04:17,804
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a little bit of lag, DarkSakura, so just tell us about your day.

1474
02:04:19,423 --> 02:04:24,748
[SPEAKER_01]: I spent all day at Classic Gaming Expo looking at a bunch of stuff that I wanted to buy.

1475
02:04:25,529 --> 02:04:38,200
[SPEAKER_01]: And I found myself actually put into a position of translator for some guy at this booth selling a bunch of Famicom and Super Famicom and Mega Drive games and PC Engine Hu cards.

1476
02:04:39,481 --> 02:04:44,666
[SPEAKER_01]: And I actually didn't get to go to any of the panels because I was busy dueling at stuff and looking at the museum.

1477
02:04:45,602 --> 02:04:47,683
[SPEAKER_01]: which actually wasn't as impressive as it was before.

1478
02:04:47,703 --> 02:04:49,264
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just all the same stuff.

1479
02:04:49,905 --> 02:04:56,348
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're going to be taking a year off next year and coming back in 2007 and hopefully that's going to be bigger and better.

1480
02:04:56,909 --> 02:05:01,732
[SPEAKER_01]: This year was kind of eh, but I got to meet the guys who run Retro Gaming Radio.

1481
02:05:02,552 --> 02:05:03,312
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.

1482
02:05:03,633 --> 02:05:04,313
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty big.

1483
02:05:06,014 --> 02:05:08,676
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually had a pretty long discussion about Don Bluth.

1484
02:05:10,677 --> 02:05:11,377
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

1485
02:05:12,738 --> 02:05:12,818
[SPEAKER_01]: Um...

1486
02:05:14,173 --> 02:05:22,616
[SPEAKER_01]: I also got to meet this person who built basically a miniature Nintendo that runs the Famicom and Nintendo games.

1487
02:05:22,936 --> 02:05:23,896
[SPEAKER_01]: I took some pictures of that.

1488
02:05:23,916 --> 02:05:25,577
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll be up on the site in a few days.

1489
02:05:25,757 --> 02:05:27,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that the same one from E3?

1490
02:05:29,178 --> 02:05:32,059
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember because I don't think I saw him at E3.

1491
02:05:32,199 --> 02:05:32,479
[SPEAKER_01]: It was...

1492
02:05:32,935 --> 02:05:35,837
[SPEAKER_01]: Famicom Loader Front Loader Disk System

1493
02:05:54,488 --> 02:05:55,870
[SPEAKER_04]: Doki Doki Panic Doki Doki Panic

1494
02:06:14,347 --> 02:06:18,888
[SPEAKER_04]: The whole reason behind that, and it makes a lot of sense, is... What's the name of that thing called, Anne?

1495
02:06:45,497 --> 02:07:09,507
[SPEAKER_01]: California Extreme California Extreme, that's basically replacing all of the big massive arcade of retro games They had more games this year and almost all of them worked They had a Millipede, Mousetrap, Gorf, Tempest Dude, Mousetrap is awesome That's why I love my ColecoVision There's a Mousetrap and Gorf Gorf, who plays Gorf?

1496
02:07:11,721 --> 02:07:12,501
[SPEAKER_01]: Dinky Dinky

1497
02:07:41,972 --> 02:07:43,413
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a different hotel this year, right?

1498
02:07:44,513 --> 02:07:47,255
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was at the Hyatt and Burlingame.

1499
02:07:47,975 --> 02:07:49,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Was that where the Life 365 Awards were?

1500
02:07:49,516 --> 02:07:51,496
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember.

1501
02:07:51,536 --> 02:07:52,217
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it wasn't.

1502
02:07:52,237 --> 02:07:53,157
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a different hotel.

1503
02:07:53,257 --> 02:07:55,298
[SPEAKER_01]: We were actually in San Francisco.

1504
02:07:55,578 --> 02:07:56,039
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's right.

1505
02:07:56,079 --> 02:07:56,419
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

1506
02:07:57,319 --> 02:07:57,659
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1507
02:07:58,880 --> 02:08:00,120
[SPEAKER_01]: But there were people there who heard of us.

1508
02:08:00,881 --> 02:08:01,241
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

1509
02:08:02,201 --> 02:08:02,782
[SPEAKER_04]: That's crazy.

1510
02:08:02,842 --> 02:08:03,342
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of cool.

1511
02:08:04,362 --> 02:08:07,724
[SPEAKER_01]: But I made some contacts.

1512
02:08:07,784 --> 02:08:10,245
[SPEAKER_01]: We will be having more on that in the future.

1513
02:08:12,304 --> 02:08:12,584
[SPEAKER_12]: Cool.

1514
02:08:14,625 --> 02:08:20,028
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I did, though, for the people who were there, they were the folks that were really into it.

1515
02:08:20,128 --> 02:08:21,848
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, by the way, there was a new Lego sculpture.

1516
02:08:22,789 --> 02:08:23,149
[SPEAKER_12]: Of what?

1517
02:08:24,169 --> 02:08:24,730
[SPEAKER_01]: Pac-Man.

1518
02:08:24,870 --> 02:08:25,430
[SPEAKER_01]: I took a picture.

1519
02:08:25,530 --> 02:08:26,090
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, that's cool.

1520
02:08:27,631 --> 02:08:34,634
[SPEAKER_01]: And for the Moby Games thing, Dan got place number four and got me a t-shirt.

1521
02:08:35,094 --> 02:08:35,955
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, cool, cool.

1522
02:08:36,375 --> 02:08:37,095
[SPEAKER_01]: For the whole show.

1523
02:08:37,115 --> 02:08:37,315
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.

1524
02:08:37,375 --> 02:08:38,236
[SPEAKER_12]: For what game?

1525
02:08:43,839 --> 02:08:45,180
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to name the screenshot.

1526
02:08:46,080 --> 02:08:47,281
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I remember that thing.

1527
02:08:47,441 --> 02:08:49,783
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I remember that.

1528
02:08:50,063 --> 02:08:56,747
[SPEAKER_04]: What was the contest they had last year where we all had to play the Stampede on Atari?

1529
02:08:56,987 --> 02:08:58,348
[SPEAKER_04]: Did they do something like that again this year?

1530
02:08:58,629 --> 02:08:59,229
[SPEAKER_04]: Twin Galaxies?

1531
02:08:59,269 --> 02:09:02,631
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that there was some type of game going on on a widescreen.

1532
02:09:03,412 --> 02:09:11,037
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing, Rob, I think that you'll get a kick out of in the museum room, they had a jaguar hooked up onto their projector, and it was Tempest X.

1533
02:09:11,687 --> 02:09:12,067
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

1534
02:09:12,408 --> 02:09:13,128
[SPEAKER_01]: Which was Tempest 2000.

1535
02:09:13,808 --> 02:09:14,129
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

1536
02:09:14,189 --> 02:09:16,050
[SPEAKER_04]: Tempest is like my favorite Jaguar game ever.

1537
02:09:17,651 --> 02:09:18,892
[SPEAKER_04]: Was 8-Bit Weapon back this year?

1538
02:09:19,652 --> 02:09:20,913
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, 8-Bit Weapon was back.

1539
02:09:20,953 --> 02:09:28,738
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, I was sort of out of cash because somebody found the core graphics in Strider on the PC Engine Duo.

1540
02:09:29,818 --> 02:09:30,098
[SPEAKER_12]: Dope.

1541
02:09:30,659 --> 02:09:34,901
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would have picked up one of their CDs, but I think I still got their card from last year.

1542
02:09:34,921 --> 02:09:35,722
[SPEAKER_01]: I meant to contact them.

1543
02:09:36,595 --> 02:09:45,062
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also another person there just playing a bunch of game music on a keyboard.

1544
02:09:45,102 --> 02:09:52,208
[SPEAKER_04]: Just somebody who was part of the show.

1545
02:09:53,609 --> 02:10:03,057
[SPEAKER_01]: There was also, for the people who were there, the Atari people were back, of course Moby Games, the Intellivision folks were there.

1546
02:10:04,463 --> 02:10:06,924
[SPEAKER_04]: Still whoring out that Intellivision collection from like three years ago?

1547
02:10:07,704 --> 02:10:07,964
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

1548
02:10:08,745 --> 02:10:14,527
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also a couple guys there who were selling MVS carts.

1549
02:10:14,727 --> 02:10:24,310
[SPEAKER_01]: For anyone who doesn't know, the MVS cartridges are the Neo Geo games and homemade JAMMA units to play them on.

1550
02:10:25,370 --> 02:10:30,672
[SPEAKER_01]: And selling like, you know... Whoa.

1551
02:10:31,152 --> 02:10:31,733
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, whoa.

1552
02:10:33,922 --> 02:10:35,503
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoa!

1553
02:10:35,603 --> 02:10:36,503
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1554
02:10:36,963 --> 02:10:38,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoa, Jamie, hold up, hold up.

1555
02:10:38,324 --> 02:10:40,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie, your voice went like crazy there for a minute.

1556
02:10:40,725 --> 02:10:46,287
[SPEAKER_04]: You sounded like an evil lord, a demon, from like an Atari 2600 game.

1557
02:10:46,327 --> 02:10:48,228
[SPEAKER_04]: We gotta save that clip for the next intro.

1558
02:10:48,268 --> 02:10:49,128
[SPEAKER_04]: That was crazy.

1559
02:10:50,108 --> 02:10:52,169
[SPEAKER_04]: Start over again with that paragraph, Jamie.

1560
02:10:53,250 --> 02:10:53,490
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

1561
02:10:54,210 --> 02:11:01,053
[SPEAKER_01]: A guy there who was selling basically anything NEC, practically it was...

1562
02:11:01,986 --> 02:11:14,456
[SPEAKER_01]: Duo R, Duo RX, Core Graphics, a bunch of Turbo Graphics, Turbo Duo Games, PC Engine Duo Games, Arcade Cards, you name it.

1563
02:11:14,516 --> 02:11:15,617
[SPEAKER_01]: He had a bunch of good stuff.

1564
02:11:15,637 --> 02:11:17,638
[SPEAKER_01]: We picked up like five HuCard games.

1565
02:11:21,301 --> 02:11:25,825
[SPEAKER_01]: But his other main thing, though, is that he mods consoles.

1566
02:11:25,865 --> 02:11:27,947
[SPEAKER_01]: He actually has basically regionless...

1567
02:11:29,451 --> 02:11:38,816
[SPEAKER_01]: Duo Dittl Cell, because the one thing is that the Duo, the CD will read any region and has no problem with replicas.

1568
02:11:39,616 --> 02:11:48,741
[SPEAKER_01]: However, the cards themselves are not universal and there's not any real good adapter, but he's modded a universal system for it.

1569
02:11:50,001 --> 02:11:52,643
[SPEAKER_01]: And he does video mods, super guns, jamming units.

1570
02:11:52,683 --> 02:11:57,465
[SPEAKER_01]: He actually has made this really tiny jamming unit for MVS cartridges.

1571
02:11:57,964 --> 02:12:02,245
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if an explanation of those came through, but the MVS cartridges are the Neo Geo games.

1572
02:12:05,766 --> 02:12:12,989
[SPEAKER_01]: I had wished that there were the modified cartridges to play on the AVS systems.

1573
02:12:13,949 --> 02:12:21,411
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, again, the Intellivision people were there, like I said.

1574
02:12:21,811 --> 02:12:24,112
[SPEAKER_01]: The people with the massive Atari stuff were there.

1575
02:12:24,712 --> 02:12:26,933
[SPEAKER_01]: Expensive Lynx games, oh my god.

1576
02:12:27,951 --> 02:12:36,455
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but the booth that I liked the best, I'd have to say, was the, uh, the guy from Japan just selling stuff.

1577
02:12:36,715 --> 02:12:38,455
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, there's just a random guy from Japan selling stuff?

1578
02:12:39,356 --> 02:12:45,958
[SPEAKER_01]: He was selling, uh, Famicom, Super Nintendo, um, cue cards, um, all kinds of stuff.

1579
02:12:46,038 --> 02:12:48,079
[SPEAKER_01]: They were like five games for ten dollars.

1580
02:12:48,099 --> 02:12:48,760
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool.

1581
02:12:48,780 --> 02:12:52,441
[SPEAKER_01]: So I picked up Final Fantasy II on the Famicom.

1582
02:12:52,661 --> 02:12:53,041
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.

1583
02:12:53,061 --> 02:12:56,803
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, Mappyland, in the box, on the Famicom.

1584
02:12:56,863 --> 02:12:57,123
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh-huh.

1585
02:12:57,143 --> 02:12:57,363
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh-huh.

1586
02:12:59,513 --> 02:13:05,155
[SPEAKER_01]: Tuyo Pio for the Mega Drive and Legend of the Valkyrie for PC Engine.

1587
02:13:05,215 --> 02:13:06,695
[SPEAKER_04]: That was $10 for all that?

1588
02:13:08,135 --> 02:13:06,695
$10.

1589
02:13:08,195 --> 02:13:09,736
[SPEAKER_04]: You could make a killing for some of that on eBay.

1590
02:13:09,756 --> 02:13:12,896
[SPEAKER_01]: It had a price tag of $20 on it.

1591
02:13:13,176 --> 02:13:13,497
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

1592
02:13:13,677 --> 02:13:15,157
[SPEAKER_04]: You could make a killing for some of that on eBay.

1593
02:13:16,137 --> 02:13:17,478
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but I actually want to play it.

1594
02:13:18,298 --> 02:13:18,718
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1595
02:13:18,738 --> 02:13:20,698
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1596
02:13:20,718 --> 02:13:21,198
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see.

1597
02:13:21,318 --> 02:13:21,759
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see.

1598
02:13:22,579 --> 02:13:22,899
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows?

1599
02:13:22,979 --> 02:13:27,480
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I'll get fed up and one of those will become a prize for one of our loyal

1600
02:13:28,417 --> 02:13:29,138
[SPEAKER_12]: Ooh, that would be cool.

1601
02:13:29,438 --> 02:13:30,339
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, sounds good.

1602
02:13:30,379 --> 02:13:30,659
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

1603
02:13:32,881 --> 02:13:33,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop teasing him.

1604
02:13:34,722 --> 02:13:40,247
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well we're going to go ahead and we'll hear more about Classic Gaming Expo on this week's podcast.

1605
02:13:40,267 --> 02:13:40,947
[SPEAKER_04]: You cannot hang up on me!

1606
02:13:41,588 --> 02:13:48,233
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to hang up on you, but we have to get to the FUs of the week and the other stuff too in a break, because I really got to go to the bathroom.

1607
02:13:49,234 --> 02:13:51,276
[SPEAKER_01]: That was crap.

1608
02:13:52,597 --> 02:13:52,917
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello?

1609
02:13:54,018 --> 02:13:54,779

02:13:58,783 --> 02:13:59,323
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoa, hi.

1613
02:13:59,744 --> 02:14:02,046
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoa, she went into evil warlord voice there again for a minute.

1614
02:14:03,847 --> 02:14:05,669
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else you want to say to the listeners before we go?

1615
02:14:09,132 --> 02:14:09,512
[SPEAKER_01]: Words.

1616
02:14:10,053 --> 02:14:10,353

[SPEAKER_04]: All right, have a good one, DarkSakura.

1619
02:14:14,536 --> 02:14:15,978
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see you back for the podcast.

02:14:16,838 --> 02:14:17,759
[SPEAKER_01]: Reject false icons.

1621
02:14:17,879 --> 02:14:18,219
[SPEAKER_04]: Later.

1622
02:14:19,260 --> 02:14:21,182
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.

1623
02:14:21,202 --> 02:14:22,743
[SPEAKER_04]: See, she beat me to the hang up button.

1624
02:14:22,963 --> 02:14:23,364
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.

1625
02:14:24,004 --> 02:14:25,165
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was weird.

1626
02:14:25,185 --> 02:14:25,946
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when she was.

1627
02:14:27,583 --> 02:14:30,585
[SPEAKER_04]: I am the evil Lord Satan Like, that was really scary.

1628
02:14:31,206 --> 02:14:31,886
[SPEAKER_04]: I got freaked out.

1629
02:14:31,946 --> 02:14:32,267
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1630
02:14:33,768 --> 02:14:37,891
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, we're gonna go to a break because I have to pee.

1631
02:14:38,111 --> 02:14:43,074
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when we come back from this break, we'll announce tonight's Cage Match winner and we'll get into the FUs of the week as well.

1632
02:14:43,515 --> 02:14:46,737
[SPEAKER_04]: So, we're gonna do just Bimani Potpourri this break.

1633
02:14:46,817 --> 02:14:53,242
[SPEAKER_04]: Even some wanna-be Bimani music in this break because I'm gonna get to that request that I screwed up last week in this break.

1634
02:14:53,642 --> 02:14:55,904
[SPEAKER_04]: So, we'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio after this.

1635
02:15:08,908 --> 02:15:11,989
DarkSakura, DarkSakura DarkSakura DarkSakura

1636
02:17:07,131 --> 02:17:08,400
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for watching

1637
02:18:08,575 --> 02:18:09,693
Thanks for watching!

1638
02:19:01,505 --> 02:19:07,267
[SPEAKER_15]: I am a robot, sinking like a robot, walking on the spaceship every night and day.

1639
02:19:07,367 --> 02:19:13,309
[SPEAKER_15]: I am a robot, sexy like a robot, making children kept and keeps the streets away.

1640
02:19:13,349 --> 02:19:14,090
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm Romeo, I'm Juliet.

1641
02:19:14,170 --> 02:19:15,210
I'm Romeo, I'm Juliet.

1642
02:19:37,752 --> 02:19:40,864
I know it's good, but I'm feeling so insatiable

1643
02:20:11,515 --> 02:20:21,786
I was built to serve a mission And I deeply forget him The first time that I walked in my life I felt a strange attraction Felt a strange attraction

1644
02:20:42,475 --> 02:20:45,759
I know it's quick and easy Satisfaction Satisfaction Look down

1645
02:22:38,152 --> 02:22:41,354
[SPEAKER_04]: After this song, we'll be having a Let Them Move Marathon.

1646
02:22:41,674 --> 02:22:42,114
[SPEAKER_15]: No!

1647
02:22:43,915 --> 02:22:44,576
[SPEAKER_04]: Just kidding.

1648
02:22:45,016 --> 02:22:46,037
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge Radio.

1649
02:22:46,117 --> 02:22:47,737
[SPEAKER_04]: Crap-free Bobani Radio.

1650
02:22:49,699 --> 02:22:51,940
[SPEAKER_04]: We're back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1651
02:22:52,920 --> 02:22:57,823
[SPEAKER_04]: And in that break, you heard Naoki was still in my heart, Nina from In The Groove, Romeo and Juliet.

1652
02:22:58,724 --> 02:22:59,444
[SPEAKER_04]: Juliet what?

1653
02:23:00,545 --> 02:23:04,487
[SPEAKER_04]: Murmur Twins, a guitar mix from Pop Music and Love Is Dreaminess, 2DX, Sick Style.

1654
02:23:05,336 --> 02:23:06,657
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome back to Orange Laundry.

1655
02:23:06,717 --> 02:23:07,418
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, this is weird.

1656
02:23:07,498 --> 02:23:09,619
[SPEAKER_04]: Now suddenly Loki and I are sitting in the room by ourselves.

1657
02:23:09,679 --> 02:23:12,281
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, all of our guests abandon us, like, all at once.

1658
02:23:12,661 --> 02:23:12,882
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

1659
02:23:13,042 --> 02:23:20,467
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Miklatov and Extifer went to Taco Bell, and... Because I don't eat Taco Bell, so I won't take Miklatov there.

1660
02:23:21,388 --> 02:23:28,613
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, what, we have... John and Justin went in the front room to go watch television, because I guess that's more interesting than the show.

1661
02:23:29,153 --> 02:23:29,794
[SPEAKER_04]: No, there's a certain...

1662
02:23:30,356 --> 02:23:39,500
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a certain show that Jon has to watch every week, and I'm sure a lot of you out there are no different, although folks should consider investing in a VCR or TiVo or something.

1663
02:23:41,741 --> 02:23:44,783
[SPEAKER_02]: I was reading here about Dancing Stage Max.

1664
02:23:45,003 --> 02:23:46,144
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up with Dancing Stage Max?

1665
02:23:46,184 --> 02:23:48,865
[SPEAKER_02]: I know there was a little news on Dancing Stage Max this week, so what's up with that?

1666
02:23:48,905 --> 02:23:53,887
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a bit more now, because they've made it some games convention or whatever.

1667
02:23:54,708 --> 02:23:55,948
[SPEAKER_02]: It was in Europe.

1668
02:23:56,488 --> 02:23:57,409
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got some more stuff.

1669
02:23:57,449 --> 02:23:58,429

1671
02:24:21,986 --> 02:24:23,507
[SPEAKER_02]: No, she never sang that song though, did she?

1672
02:24:23,527 --> 02:24:24,187
[SPEAKER_02]: Says LaBelle.

1673
02:24:24,627 --> 02:24:25,888
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just telling you what it says.

1674
02:24:25,908 --> 02:24:26,148
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1675
02:24:26,748 --> 02:24:27,929
[SPEAKER_02]: Who sang that song originally?

1676
02:24:28,089 --> 02:24:29,830
[SPEAKER_02]: Adam Ant with Goody Two Shoes.

1677
02:24:29,970 --> 02:24:31,351
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's kind of interesting.

02:24:31,791 --> 02:24:33,212
[SPEAKER_02]: Franz Ferdinand with Michael.

1679
02:24:33,712 --> 02:24:34,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

[SPEAKER_02]: Natasha Bedingfield with These Words.

1681
02:24:36,713 --> 02:24:37,234
[SPEAKER_04]: I love this song.

1682
02:24:37,254 --> 02:24:38,114
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on, I have a clip of this song.

1683
02:24:38,214 --> 02:24:38,914
[SPEAKER_04]: I love this song.

1684
02:24:43,957 --> 02:24:45,618
[SPEAKER_04]: And it will have the video from what I understand.

1685
02:24:54,678 --> 02:25:07,608
[SPEAKER_02]: Alcazar with This Is The World We Live In Fatboy Slim with Wonderful Nights Naoto Suzuki featuring Martha the Polo Vision Dances and Chorus Yuzo Koshiro with Steps

1686
02:25:12,560 --> 02:25:14,321
[SPEAKER_02]: You might remember them from, you know.

1687
02:25:14,821 --> 02:25:15,781
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

1688
02:25:15,861 --> 02:25:16,761
[SPEAKER_24]: Tragedy.

1689
02:25:16,902 --> 02:25:17,382
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah.

1690
02:25:17,502 --> 02:25:18,002
[SPEAKER_24]: Tragedy.

1691
02:25:18,422 --> 02:25:22,984
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I was thinking of steps with, um, was it, uh... Five, six, seven, eight.

1692
02:25:23,104 --> 02:25:32,827
[SPEAKER_04]: I just know their song Tragedy because my, my... Now, I've, you know, I'm a gay guy myself, so I don't make fun of other gay guys very often, but I used to live with a flaming homosexual, okay?

1693
02:25:33,499 --> 02:25:35,159
[SPEAKER_04]: Flaming Homosexual, love him to death.

1694
02:25:35,280 --> 02:25:39,701
[SPEAKER_04]: He was a flaming homosexual and he used to listen to that song and do the little dance and everything.

1695
02:25:39,961 --> 02:25:55,465
[SPEAKER_02]: Chain Reaction, Christina Milan with Dip It Low, Vic Reeves with Dizzy, Mile with Drop The Pressure, Daniel Bedingfield with Friday, and Carl Douglas with Kung Fu Fighting.

1696
02:25:56,645 --> 02:25:58,066
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they've got some more here.

1697
02:25:59,269 --> 02:26:15,194
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks like in the demo or the preliminary song list, they mentioned these words, Natasha Bedingfield, Michael, Franz Ferdinand, in the middle, Sugar Babes, Goody Two Shoes, Adam and the Ants, You Sexy Thing, Hot Chocolate, and Shout, Lulu.

1698
02:26:15,594 --> 02:26:23,677
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, my question about You Sexy Thing, is it that song they always hear in the commercial, You Sexy, Sexy Thing, You Sexy, because that would be horrible.

1699
02:26:24,356 --> 02:26:35,862
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, but there's going to be a Dance Master mode in it, as well as some advanced mode thing, and combo challenge mode, which is going to be interesting.

1700
02:26:35,882 --> 02:26:39,224
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's basically the same stuff as in DDR Extreme 2, pretty much.

1701
02:26:40,525 --> 02:26:42,466
[SPEAKER_02]: So, that's what we've got there.

1702
02:26:43,766 --> 02:26:44,127
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds good.

1703
02:26:44,947 --> 02:26:46,428
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for that update on what's going on over there.

1704
02:26:46,468 --> 02:26:48,729
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and of course, Dancing Stage Mario Mix is coming soon.

1705
02:26:49,937 --> 02:26:52,660
[SPEAKER_04]: DDR with Mario is a game we haven't really talked about a whole lot lately.

1706
02:26:52,700 --> 02:27:03,108
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it came out in Japan to this big... The DDR fans, anyway, in America, really... People usually import their DDRs from Japan, but I haven't really heard of anybody importing Mario.

1707
02:27:03,489 --> 02:27:05,070
[SPEAKER_04]: So nobody's really been going crazy over it.

1708
02:27:05,671 --> 02:27:07,272
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you think that game's going to do over here?

1709
02:27:07,352 --> 02:27:10,735
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't really heard a lot of buzz about this game.

1710
02:27:12,629 --> 02:27:22,579
[SPEAKER_04]: GameCube is sinking ship right now, especially after... Please, Nintendo fanboys, don't start flaming me because I love Nintendo dearly.

1711
02:27:23,100 --> 02:27:24,361
[SPEAKER_04]: I love Nintendo.

1712
02:27:24,842 --> 02:27:26,483
[SPEAKER_04]: But they fucked up that Zelda thing.

1713
02:27:26,683 --> 02:27:30,167
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on, pushing back Zelda to 2006, come on.

1714
02:27:30,227 --> 02:27:31,048
[SPEAKER_04]: They fucked that up.

1715
02:27:31,681 --> 02:28:00,247
[SPEAKER_04]: so a lot of people are just like done with Nintendo for right now in fact if you're running if you look at the poll right now going on at OrangeLaunchRadio.com I don't think the Nintendo screwed up result is winning but a significant amount of people have been answering that that way so it's kind of I don't know interesting yeah I don't know really you know speaking on the rental side of things nobody carries the GameCube anymore nobody

1716
02:28:02,244 --> 02:28:03,385
[SPEAKER_02]: and the stuff they release for it.

1717
02:28:03,605 --> 02:28:13,356
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really kid-based games like Mario Superstar Baseball or Mario Strikers, which is coming out because everybody loves soccer or football, however you want to call it.

1718
02:28:13,917 --> 02:28:16,680
[SPEAKER_02]: But just, I don't know.

1719
02:28:19,214 --> 02:28:46,561
[SPEAKER_04]: of course I've got the mandatory fuck you Sky you hate Nintendo and I hate you comment from the chatroom I don't hate Nintendo I have not stopped playing Meteos for like the past two months I'm squeeing like a little girl over Nintendogs which is coming out Tuesday I don't even freaking like dogs that much I've never owned a dog in my life the only dog I ever liked was my grandma's Dachshund but I am buying Nintendogs because I'll be damned if that wasn't the cutest game I've seen in like five years

1720
02:28:46,940 --> 02:28:48,201
[SPEAKER_04]: So don't tell me I hate Nintendo.

1721
02:28:48,221 --> 02:28:48,901
[SPEAKER_04]: I love Nintendo.

1722
02:28:49,181 --> 02:28:50,622
[SPEAKER_04]: They really fucked up Zelda.

1723
02:28:50,662 --> 02:28:52,203
[SPEAKER_04]: They really, really fucked that up.

1724
02:28:53,683 --> 02:28:54,084
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

1725
02:28:54,464 --> 02:28:58,246
[SPEAKER_02]: And this whole thing with the revolution, we still haven't heard shit about it.

1726
02:28:58,686 --> 02:29:02,448
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're even talking about me releasing it the fall of 2006.

1727
02:29:02,548 --> 02:29:06,370
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, that's not gonna fucking suck.

1728
02:29:07,570 --> 02:29:10,512
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless it's like super revolutionary, which I highly doubt that.

1729
02:29:11,192 --> 02:29:11,692
[SPEAKER_02]: But we'll see.

1730
02:29:11,712 --> 02:29:13,333
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1731
02:29:15,429 --> 02:29:18,392
[SPEAKER_04]: Who wants to see the winner of tonight's cage match?

1732
02:29:18,452 --> 02:29:21,015
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to know tonight's wiener for tonight's cage match?

1733
02:29:21,095 --> 02:29:22,756
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, since I'm the only other person in here.

1734
02:29:23,177 --> 02:29:26,240
[SPEAKER_04]: There were a freaking ton of votes in tonight's cage match.

1735
02:29:26,300 --> 02:29:26,920
[SPEAKER_04]: Ton of votes.

1736
02:29:27,561 --> 02:29:31,845
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a single vote for DJ Sammy, which pisses me the fuck off.

1737
02:29:32,245 --> 02:29:36,429
[SPEAKER_04]: So next week, you are getting another booty song.

1738
02:29:36,469 --> 02:29:38,872
[SPEAKER_04]: You're getting something along the lines of Camel Toe.

1739
02:29:40,293 --> 02:29:41,673
[SPEAKER_04]: or what was another booty song I put in?

1740
02:29:41,713 --> 02:29:42,414
[SPEAKER_04]: Milkshake.

1741
02:29:42,774 --> 02:29:44,695
[SPEAKER_04]: Milkshake, Put It In My Mouth.

1742
02:29:45,095 --> 02:29:46,616
[SPEAKER_04]: All those songs I put in case before.

1743
02:29:46,656 --> 02:29:51,438
[SPEAKER_04]: You're getting another one of those next week because I'm pissed off that not a single person voted for DJ Sammy.

1744
02:29:52,098 --> 02:29:52,519
[SPEAKER_04]: Suck it.

1745
02:29:54,199 --> 02:29:55,900
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyway, it came down to the other two songs.

1746
02:29:55,940 --> 02:29:57,541
[SPEAKER_04]: It was actually very, very close.

1747
02:29:57,621 --> 02:30:04,985
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of votes, but a couple votes did sway it towards a two-week win for

1748
02:30:06,380 --> 02:30:07,881
[SPEAKER_04]: Cold Storage with Onyx.

1749
02:30:08,521 --> 02:30:11,102
[SPEAKER_02]: I should put my backup songs in more often.

1750
02:30:11,182 --> 02:30:13,963
[SPEAKER_04]: Two weeks winning there, Cold Storage with Onyx.

1751
02:30:14,843 --> 02:30:16,864
[SPEAKER_04]: Congratulations, Loki, you bastard.

1752
02:30:17,304 --> 02:30:18,484
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have to pick a song next week.

1753
02:30:18,524 --> 02:30:20,185
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a reward enough for me.

1754
02:30:20,405 --> 02:30:22,826
[SPEAKER_04]: So next week you get a booty song from me, because I'm pissed.

1755
02:30:23,286 --> 02:30:28,108
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm sure DarkSakura's not happy either, so she'll dig into her archives of

1756
02:30:29,088 --> 02:30:31,870
[SPEAKER_04]: Nerd Music and find something.

1757
02:30:32,570 --> 02:30:34,111
[SPEAKER_04]: How else do you explain MC Chris?

1758
02:30:34,131 --> 02:30:35,312
[SPEAKER_04]: That's his Nerd Music.

1759
02:30:35,552 --> 02:30:37,374
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody else gets MC Chris but nerds.

1760
02:30:37,994 --> 02:30:43,138
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm calling her Music Nerd Music, but with love and respect, of course.

1761
02:30:44,599 --> 02:30:44,939
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1762
02:30:45,379 --> 02:30:48,701
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, we're going to get into the FUs of the week.

1763
02:30:48,781 --> 02:30:54,505
[SPEAKER_04]: It's that time of the show where we get a little bit angsty and we do the FUs of the week.

1764
02:30:55,106 --> 02:30:55,366
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

1765
02:30:56,485 --> 02:30:56,786
[SPEAKER_04]: Grr, Arrg

1766
02:31:16,758 --> 02:31:32,987
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, as a reminder, boys and girls, if you have an FU of the week you want to send in, you can submit us an FU by joining our chat room, www.orangeloungeradio.com and clicking on chat, and you can send me a private message, and we will read your FUs, but...

1767
02:31:33,667 --> 02:31:38,971
[SPEAKER_04]: May I take this opportunity, since Jamie isn't here to fill this space right now, to give you guys some reminders.

1768
02:31:39,291 --> 02:31:42,353
[SPEAKER_04]: We do not give FUs of a personal nature.

1769
02:31:43,835 --> 02:31:46,576
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless it's like mom, dad, because we've all been angsty teens.

1770
02:31:46,637 --> 02:31:47,257
[SPEAKER_04]: We do those.

1771
02:31:47,277 --> 02:31:54,622
[SPEAKER_04]: And if it's somebody we don't know, but if you're flaming somebody in the community specifically, we usually don't like that unless it's like Jack Thompson or something.

1772
02:31:54,642 --> 02:31:55,143
[SPEAKER_04]: Or me.

1773
02:31:55,343 --> 02:31:56,043
[SPEAKER_04]: We all hate him.

1774
02:31:56,123 --> 02:31:56,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Or Loki.

1775
02:31:56,584 --> 02:31:57,464
[SPEAKER_04]: We let you flame Loki.

1776
02:31:57,805 --> 02:32:00,527
[SPEAKER_04]: But we don't like to flame people that aren't here to defend themselves.

1777
02:32:00,567 --> 02:32:01,727
[SPEAKER_04]: So those are always off limits.

1778
02:32:03,980 --> 02:32:08,702
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, no racist FUs, unless they're really funny.

1779
02:32:10,363 --> 02:32:13,124
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that's the only time we'll let them in, is if they're really funny.

1780
02:32:14,665 --> 02:32:19,447
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, uh, let's see, actually I have a private message from DarkSakura, so maybe she does have some FUs.

1781
02:32:19,467 --> 02:32:21,928
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go, she would like to say, Fuck my hip hurting!

1782
02:32:23,028 --> 02:32:27,030
[SPEAKER_04]: And fuck the speed limit, which I broke by at least 20 miles.

1783
02:32:28,171 --> 02:32:30,752
[SPEAKER_04]: And fuck not buying a Duo RX.

1784
02:32:31,823 --> 02:32:33,664
[SPEAKER_04]: So those are DarkSakura's FUs of the week.

1785
02:32:33,705 --> 02:32:34,785
[SPEAKER_04]: I think she's still typing.

1786
02:32:35,206 --> 02:32:36,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no, she's... Oh, here's another one.

1787
02:32:36,967 --> 02:32:39,169
[SPEAKER_04]: And lastly... I'm waiting for this.

1788
02:32:39,609 --> 02:32:40,770
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura's last FU.

1789
02:32:40,970 --> 02:32:43,272
[SPEAKER_04]: FU to the internet being slow, and FU to the big buffer.

1790
02:32:44,013 --> 02:32:47,275
[SPEAKER_04]: The 30 seconds between when we talk and when you guys actually hear it.

1791
02:32:50,318 --> 02:32:50,738
[SPEAKER_04]: We're waiting.

1792
02:32:51,038 --> 02:32:53,660
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, she's typing a big long sentence here, because it's taking a while to get it.

1793
02:32:54,441 --> 02:32:56,763
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll just enjoy the Silent Hill 2 music here for a little bit.

1794
02:32:56,783 --> 02:32:56,763
1, 2, 2...

1795
02:33:00,785 --> 02:33:01,186
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, here it is.

1796
02:33:01,567 --> 02:33:04,952
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck being jacked up on Vicodin and unable to drive.

1797
02:33:06,334 --> 02:33:07,195
[SPEAKER_04]: And DarkSakura?

1798
02:33:07,515 --> 02:33:11,822
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, the Coleco emulator was on the DS.

1799
02:33:12,663 --> 02:33:14,987
[SPEAKER_04]: Now it's time for Loki's FUs.

1800
02:33:15,879 --> 02:33:16,800
Just sobs.

1801
02:33:39,042 --> 02:33:54,610
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm sitting there going, because the fucking, then he flips me off, so then he finally turns, you know, pulls over, and then I flip him off and honk my horn and make, you know, comments like, You know, stuff like that.

1802
02:33:54,710 --> 02:33:56,711
[SPEAKER_04]: Our listeners, speakers, thank you for that.

1803
02:33:57,871 --> 02:34:04,655
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they had to, you have to understand that I was yelling very loud, so, you know, I was trying to convey that, because I said,

1804
02:34:05,559 --> 02:34:07,760
[SPEAKER_02]: I yelled, you know, you fucking piece of shit.

1805
02:34:07,820 --> 02:34:09,821
[SPEAKER_02]: It isn't quite, you know, the same effect.

1806
02:34:10,862 --> 02:34:11,162
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways.

1807
02:34:13,103 --> 02:34:18,205
[SPEAKER_02]: And then fuck you to the fact that I've still got to drive my fiance around everywhere because that kind of sucks.

1808
02:34:19,446 --> 02:34:24,748
[SPEAKER_02]: And I still need a picture of me doing this show for a stupid magazine thing.

1809
02:34:24,908 --> 02:34:25,769
[SPEAKER_04]: I found all my batteries.

1810
02:34:25,889 --> 02:34:26,449
[SPEAKER_04]: I can take a picture.

1811
02:34:26,569 --> 02:34:27,069
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, cool.

1812
02:34:27,389 --> 02:34:28,050
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, all right.

1813
02:34:28,090 --> 02:34:28,570
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I have.

1814
02:34:28,610 --> 02:34:29,670
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll pose pictures later.

1815
02:34:29,710 --> 02:34:33,732
[SPEAKER_02]: And just fuck you to Jack Thompson because it's fun to say that.

1816
02:34:34,853 --> 02:34:35,193
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1817
02:34:38,020 --> 02:34:38,352
[SPEAKER_04]: My turn.

1818
02:34:44,713 --> 02:35:12,328
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like to give a big F you to getting sick and an F you to Southwest Airlines for their little hotbeds of viruses they call airplanes and the fact that I caught a sinus infection an F you to the fact that I didn't go to the doctor for a few days an F you to my allergy to amoxicillin because apparently amoxicillin is the best thing to take for this stuff but if I take amoxicillin I break out in a big rash and I look like Freaky Rash Boy so I can't stop laughing

1819
02:35:13,593 --> 02:35:14,573
[SPEAKER_04]: Why are you laughing at that?

1820
02:35:14,593 --> 02:35:17,274
[SPEAKER_02]: Will you show up at the next DDR tournament as Freaky Rashboy?

1821
02:35:17,374 --> 02:35:21,656
[SPEAKER_04]: No, because they say if I do that too much, I might die, so I can't take penicillin, like, ever.

1822
02:35:21,756 --> 02:35:23,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, a really good tournament, then.

1823
02:35:24,636 --> 02:35:33,899
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, so, an FU to the fact, an FU to the nasal spray I have being a brand copay, because brands are more expensive than generics.

1824
02:35:35,080 --> 02:35:39,721
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's it, that's all my FUs of the week, I'm really not that angsty, because I've been sick all week, I haven't had time to get angry.

1825
02:35:40,221 --> 02:35:41,422
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're gonna go to Justin!

1826
02:35:42,422 --> 02:35:42,622
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello.

1827
02:35:43,526 --> 02:35:45,568
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, hmm, what can I say?

1828
02:35:45,928 --> 02:35:48,910
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah, my FUs are kind of tied into Jamie's, oddly.

1829
02:35:49,550 --> 02:35:56,114
[SPEAKER_09]: FU to my hip hurting, because I have a hip problem, and it really has been hurting for like a month now, and I don't know what to do.

1830
02:35:58,095 --> 02:36:01,838
[SPEAKER_09]: And also tied into Jamie, FU to female drivers.

1831
02:36:02,697 --> 02:36:06,758
[SPEAKER_09]: Because they keep trying to hit me when I'm on the freeway, and that's kind of annoying.

1832
02:36:07,298 --> 02:36:13,080
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, uh, I can understand if you need to get somewhere fast, but don't go in the slow lane.

1833
02:36:13,120 --> 02:36:15,421
[SPEAKER_09]: Keep in the fast lane and stay there, please.

1834
02:36:15,481 --> 02:36:19,462
[SPEAKER_02]: Had one driving today, doing her hair and makeup while driving.

1835
02:36:19,562 --> 02:36:20,202
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god.

1836
02:36:20,222 --> 02:36:21,623
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking suck.

1837
02:36:21,883 --> 02:36:32,206
[SPEAKER_09]: My friend keeps on, uh, as soon as she's trying to go to school in the morning, she always takes like a left turn, and every single day the same woman cuts her off so she can do her makeup.

1838
02:36:32,970 --> 02:36:33,671
[SPEAKER_09]: It's ridiculous.

1839
02:36:34,993 --> 02:36:36,134
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's about it.

1840
02:36:38,177 --> 02:36:41,922
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh wow, Mikulatov gets back just in time from Taco Bell to give his FUs of the week.

1841
02:36:42,543 --> 02:36:43,925
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I want music.

1842
02:36:45,267 --> 02:36:45,928
[SPEAKER_04]: This is your music.

1843
02:36:46,048 --> 02:36:46,489
[SPEAKER_04]: What is it?

1844
02:36:46,729 --> 02:36:48,151
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Help Me Dr. Dick by Erotic.

1845
02:36:48,809 --> 02:36:51,970
[SPEAKER_07]: I used to have an actual music that you would play.

1846
02:36:52,110 --> 02:36:52,690
[SPEAKER_07]: Really?

1847
02:36:52,730 --> 02:36:54,510
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you want?

1848
02:36:54,650 --> 02:36:58,571
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, put the new one from Happy Sky, the one that's in French.

1849
02:36:59,031 --> 02:37:00,912
[SPEAKER_07]: Jesus Christ, what's the name of it?

1850
02:37:00,972 --> 02:37:02,232
[SPEAKER_07]: Or you'll get an FU.

1851
02:37:02,612 --> 02:37:06,113
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like... I don't know how to say it.

1852
02:37:07,113 --> 02:37:10,334
[SPEAKER_07]: How about you just do your FUs and stop whining like a little bitch?

1853
02:37:10,634 --> 02:37:12,194
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that's my FU.

1854
02:37:12,834 --> 02:37:14,194
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, anyway, I don't really care.

1855
02:37:15,355 --> 02:37:16,475
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, this is Twin Amadeus.

1856
02:37:17,112 --> 02:37:17,452
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

1857
02:37:18,013 --> 02:37:18,673
[SPEAKER_04]: You get this.

1858
02:37:19,033 --> 02:37:20,114
[SPEAKER_07]: Deal with it.

1859
02:37:21,415 --> 02:37:22,956
[SPEAKER_04]: You get the Christmas sounding song.

1860
02:37:22,996 --> 02:37:25,858
[SPEAKER_07]: Wouldn't it be funny if I don't have any FUs?

1861
02:37:26,098 --> 02:37:29,440
[SPEAKER_07]: FU to Medios for being way too addictive.

1862
02:37:31,261 --> 02:37:40,027
[SPEAKER_07]: FU to Pump It Up for PS2 because unlocking songs is way too hard to do on that game.

1863
02:37:42,188 --> 02:37:44,850
[SPEAKER_07]: FU to Work

1864
02:37:46,308 --> 02:37:46,528
[SPEAKER_07]: Tag.

1865
02:37:46,708 --> 02:37:46,869
[SPEAKER_07]: Tag.

1866
02:38:08,999 --> 02:38:10,179
[SPEAKER_07]: but probably Christine.

1867
02:38:10,499 --> 02:38:13,440
[SPEAKER_04]: An FU to Miklatov for not offering to pick me up a pizza.

1868
02:38:13,460 --> 02:38:15,721
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that's the only thing I like at Taco Bell is Pizza Hut.

1869
02:38:17,301 --> 02:38:18,462
[SPEAKER_07]: You should have said something.

1870
02:38:18,482 --> 02:38:19,402
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just kidding, it's alright.

1871
02:38:20,942 --> 02:38:21,362
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1872
02:38:22,823 --> 02:38:27,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to the next FUs, which would be the ones from our chatroom.

1873
02:38:28,504 --> 02:38:28,965
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay.

1874
02:38:30,185 --> 02:38:33,186
[SPEAKER_04]: Dark Knight would like to say an FU to gas prices.

1875
02:38:33,746 --> 02:38:35,086
[SPEAKER_04]: Quote the Dark Knight nevermore.

1876
02:38:35,246 --> 02:38:37,587
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, but FU to work and being broke as hell.

1877
02:38:39,369 --> 02:38:42,350
[SPEAKER_04]: Misty would like to say a private message to me.

1878
02:38:42,410 --> 02:38:43,491
[SPEAKER_04]: That wasn't an FU.

1879
02:38:43,551 --> 02:38:44,171
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, guys.

1880
02:38:45,351 --> 02:38:46,012
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wait, no, there it is.

1881
02:38:46,052 --> 02:38:46,392
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

1882
02:38:46,732 --> 02:38:49,773
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't recognize it because it didn't start with FU2.

1883
02:38:49,853 --> 02:38:55,275
[SPEAKER_04]: It says, You people should be lucky that I'm not so angsty because I went to Six Flags today.

1884
02:38:55,955 --> 02:38:59,117
[SPEAKER_04]: FU to the max, too, at Six Flags, having dusty-ass pads.

1885
02:38:59,857 --> 02:39:04,859
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank leetness I managed to own a minute with 29 greats and one miss, in sandals even.

1886
02:39:06,547 --> 02:39:08,849
[SPEAKER_04]: Brini says, an F you to learning to drive.

1887
02:39:09,209 --> 02:39:09,730
[SPEAKER_04]: Enough said.

1888
02:39:09,790 --> 02:39:14,934
[SPEAKER_04]: An F you to all the IRC chat users who want us to stop advertising that one channel.

1889
02:39:15,134 --> 02:39:18,957
[SPEAKER_04]: Which channel?

1890
02:39:20,218 --> 02:39:23,181
[SPEAKER_04]: If I say it, then I'm dignifying it with acknowledging it.

1891
02:39:23,581 --> 02:39:24,282
[SPEAKER_06]: Which channel?

1892
02:39:24,322 --> 02:39:30,107
[SPEAKER_04]: Take every inside joke from the past five episodes of Order's Lounge Radio and combine it into one name, and that's the name of the channel.

1893
02:39:30,707 --> 02:39:30,967
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

1894
02:39:31,148 --> 02:39:33,950
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Oregon Trail, Bleached...

1895
02:39:34,765 --> 02:39:35,666
[SPEAKER_04]: Asshole, what else?

1896
02:39:36,186 --> 02:39:36,546
[SPEAKER_04]: All of it.

1897
02:39:38,748 --> 02:39:42,591
[SPEAKER_04]: Chimera, and by the way, the whole chatroom is saying F you to this song, but you can just deal.

1898
02:39:43,151 --> 02:39:46,153
[SPEAKER_04]: Chimera says F you to school starting in about three days.

1899
02:39:46,313 --> 02:39:48,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and Jack Thompson, because MPQ said so.

1900
02:39:49,215 --> 02:39:50,216
[SPEAKER_04]: And Spider Stomp.

1901
02:39:51,537 --> 02:39:55,600
[SPEAKER_04]: Socorina says F you to myself for whoring old jokes in the chatroom.

1902
02:39:56,040 --> 02:39:58,682
[SPEAKER_04]: And F you to Jack Thompson, because MPQ said so.

1903
02:39:59,102 --> 02:40:02,365
[SPEAKER_04]: And F you to someone for making Socorina is pissed.

1904
02:40:02,445 --> 02:40:04,166
[SPEAKER_04]: Oops, I advertised that channel, sorry.

1905
02:40:06,317 --> 02:40:08,898
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay, somebody in the chatroom said, I heart this song.

1906
02:40:08,998 --> 02:40:10,098
[SPEAKER_04]: I heart it too, thank you.

1907
02:40:10,698 --> 02:40:15,999
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, Lesson Izaku says, F you to this being my last week at home before having to move back to campus next Sunday.

1908
02:40:16,559 --> 02:40:18,960
[SPEAKER_04]: F you to being broke and being jobless for almost nine months.

1909
02:40:19,460 --> 02:40:27,621
[SPEAKER_04]: F you to not having enough time to hang out with other fellow DDR players every time I go to Chinatown Fair, a DDR and In The Groove 2 arcade in Chinatown, New York City.

1910
02:40:28,482 --> 02:40:32,382
[SPEAKER_04]: And F you to having to wear a retainer after my braces were removed last week.

1911
02:40:32,722 --> 02:40:35,463
[SPEAKER_04]: They hurt like hell and I can't speak in them clearly.

1912
02:40:36,149 --> 02:40:36,469
[SPEAKER_04]: in them.

1913
02:40:43,493 --> 02:40:47,896
[SPEAKER_04]: Kuwabara says, F you to Noria for making such a sexy video to Sylvia Drive.

1914
02:40:47,936 --> 02:40:49,237
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't pass the fucking song.

1915
02:40:51,518 --> 02:40:56,822
[SPEAKER_04]: Goggle says, not Google, but Goggle says, I would like to say F you to US News College Rankings.

1916
02:40:57,202 --> 02:41:04,026
[SPEAKER_04]: They really don't mean anything, but all the overachieving, pushy parents flock to the top ones and crowd up the tours so I can't hear anything.

1917
02:41:05,256 --> 02:41:07,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Tomokun would like to say, fuck starting school soon.

1918
02:41:08,218 --> 02:41:11,640
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck people I don't know taking pictures of me playing para para dancing.

1919
02:41:11,981 --> 02:41:14,142
[SPEAKER_04]: And fuck a certain thread in the Midwest forum.

1920
02:41:14,262 --> 02:41:14,903
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck, fuck!

1921
02:41:16,964 --> 02:41:19,066
[SPEAKER_04]: Dark Knight wants to give one more FU.

1922
02:41:19,666 --> 02:41:26,971
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and a major FU to some local buttwads that go nuts when they have a laptop sale on an old-ass school uses iBooks.

1923
02:41:27,051 --> 02:41:29,353
[SPEAKER_04]: Because of this, many people got hurt by the idiots.

1924
02:41:30,618 --> 02:41:33,020
[SPEAKER_04]: I heard about the iBook stampede.

1925
02:41:33,260 --> 02:41:34,240
[SPEAKER_04]: It was crazy.

1926
02:41:34,461 --> 02:41:35,901
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard about it too.

1927
02:41:36,322 --> 02:41:36,882
[SPEAKER_04]: And I giggled.

1928
02:41:37,723 --> 02:41:38,203
[SPEAKER_04]: You would.

1929
02:41:38,843 --> 02:41:43,827
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, I haven't heard anyone use the term buttwads in like years.

1930
02:41:44,687 --> 02:41:45,268
[SPEAKER_04]: That's great.

1931
02:41:46,288 --> 02:41:46,668
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1932
02:41:48,430 --> 02:41:51,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Ask Orange Lounge when we come back from this quick break.

1933
02:41:51,311 --> 02:41:52,432
[SPEAKER_04]: Featuring more erotic.

1934
02:41:52,572 --> 02:41:54,654
[SPEAKER_04]: No, just kidding, because I'll get beat up if we actually do that.

1935
02:41:55,114 --> 02:41:56,095
[SPEAKER_04]: I already played erotic.

1936
02:41:56,415 --> 02:41:58,116
[SPEAKER_04]: Erotic fans, I already played it this show.

1937
02:41:58,656 --> 02:41:59,757
[SPEAKER_04]: How about some guitar freaks?

1938
02:42:00,580 --> 02:42:01,361
[SPEAKER_04]: I like Guitar Freaks.

1939
02:42:01,421 --> 02:42:02,181
[SPEAKER_04]: Guitar Freaks is cool.

1940
02:42:02,862 --> 02:42:07,245
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to do some of that, and when we come back, we will do some Ask Orange Lounge.

1941
02:42:07,265 --> 02:42:08,626
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just going to do a couple songs here.

1942
02:42:08,666 --> 02:42:12,909
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll start off with a little bit of Jet Coaster Girl, and we'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio.

1943
02:42:12,989 --> 02:42:14,631
[SPEAKER_04]: Ask Orange Lounge, sending your questions right now.

1944
02:42:18,153 --> 02:42:18,774
Ask Orange Lounge

1945
02:42:29,637 --> 02:42:32,298
[SPEAKER_15]: There's only a little bit left, but it's different today.

1946
02:42:32,398 --> 02:42:34,199
[SPEAKER_15]: Of course, yesterday was a B-Holiday Sunday.

1947
02:42:34,219 --> 02:42:36,259
[SPEAKER_15]: The beat of the beat can't be cut off.

1948
02:42:36,339 --> 02:42:38,400
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to make my heart beat faster.

1949
02:42:38,520 --> 02:42:39,600
If this feeling is true,

1950
02:43:00,636 --> 02:43:01,818
Thanks for watching!

1951
02:43:40,846 --> 02:43:41,808
Thanks for watching!

1952
02:44:26,098 --> 02:44:28,059
Music, Music, Music

1953
02:45:05,867 --> 02:45:14,521
Don't you know, baby, you could show up right on time Can't you see, can't you see, I've been waiting for you Can't you see, baby, you could fly on

1954
02:45:32,125 --> 02:45:38,867
[SPEAKER_20]: All right, you know what time it is, kids.

1955
02:45:39,307 --> 02:45:40,408
[SPEAKER_04]: Time for the next segment.

1956
02:45:40,668 --> 02:45:41,428
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's bring it on.

1957
02:45:48,370 --> 02:45:51,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.

1958
02:45:51,791 --> 02:45:54,992
[SPEAKER_04]: What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?

1959
02:45:55,533 --> 02:45:56,933
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing I will tell you is...

1960
02:45:57,378 --> 02:46:02,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though nobody asked, is that now Miklatov made this room smell like Taco Bell?

1961
02:46:05,745 --> 02:46:07,966
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks a lot for that, because, you know, Taco Bell makes me sick.

1962
02:46:08,927 --> 02:46:09,428
[SPEAKER_23]: You're welcome.

1963
02:46:09,728 --> 02:46:11,830
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1964
02:46:11,970 --> 02:46:16,393
[SPEAKER_04]: Participating in tonight's Ask Orange Lounge, myself, Loki, and Miklatov.

1965
02:46:16,433 --> 02:46:18,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody else left the room for better things, I guess.

1966
02:46:19,526 --> 02:46:19,907
[SPEAKER_04]: HighSchoolFreshman

1967
02:46:35,506 --> 02:46:37,986
[SPEAKER_02]: Just make sure you don't fuck up and go to the wrong classes.

1968
02:46:38,727 --> 02:46:40,607
[SPEAKER_02]: I was always worried about going to the wrong classes.

1969
02:46:40,667 --> 02:46:42,387
[SPEAKER_02]: Get your schedule ahead of time.

1970
02:46:44,448 --> 02:46:49,268
[SPEAKER_02]: In my situation where I had it was, my junior high split up into two different high schools.

1971
02:46:49,328 --> 02:46:51,469
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of my friends weren't there and some of them were new.

1972
02:46:52,469 --> 02:46:53,349
[SPEAKER_02]: Find your friends.

1973
02:46:54,049 --> 02:46:58,410
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to be that much different than junior high, really.

1974
02:47:00,550 --> 02:47:02,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Who gives a shit about the upperclassmen?

1975
02:47:02,371 --> 02:47:04,831
[SPEAKER_02]: If they're still picking on you, that's retarded.

1976
02:47:05,140 --> 02:47:11,225
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the upperclassmen hazing thing is so, like, 1970, because every school now has the anti-hazing rules.

1977
02:47:11,265 --> 02:47:17,811
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's nothing, even when I went to high school, which was quite some time ago, they didn't have a problem with that.

1978
02:47:17,911 --> 02:47:19,753
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know what?

1979
02:47:19,773 --> 02:47:21,214
[SPEAKER_04]: Just be yourself.

1980
02:47:21,714 --> 02:47:21,975
[SPEAKER_02]: Just don't...

1981
02:47:23,118 --> 02:47:24,459
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't try to be something you're not.

1982
02:47:24,699 --> 02:47:26,999
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish I could tell every high schooler in the world that.

1983
02:47:27,079 --> 02:47:29,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Just be yourself and who cares what other people think.

1984
02:47:29,580 --> 02:47:29,940
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

1985
02:47:29,960 --> 02:47:30,541
[SPEAKER_02]: Who cares?

1986
02:47:30,701 --> 02:47:38,843
[SPEAKER_02]: And really, when you think about it now, when you get out of high school and stuff, you look back on it and you're just like, who cares?

1987
02:47:38,963 --> 02:47:41,764
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like, if people didn't like you for some reason, you don't care.

1988
02:47:42,124 --> 02:47:45,766
[SPEAKER_02]: All you look back on is the things that you didn't do that you wish you had.

1989
02:47:45,826 --> 02:47:46,666
[SPEAKER_02]: That's basically it.

1990
02:47:47,406 --> 02:47:50,127
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, to completely counter, you know,

1991
02:47:50,899 --> 02:47:52,000
[SPEAKER_07]: Subtitles by the Amara.org community

1992
02:48:09,315 --> 02:48:09,836
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1993
02:48:23,183 --> 02:48:23,503
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1994
02:48:23,883 --> 02:48:26,204
[SPEAKER_02]: The only people you can make fun of are the stupid people.

1995
02:48:26,424 --> 02:48:29,385
[SPEAKER_02]: Not the retarded people, because they can't help it, but stupid people.

1996
02:48:29,485 --> 02:48:30,986
[SPEAKER_04]: Every click serves its purpose.

1997
02:48:31,306 --> 02:48:32,306
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got to move on.

1998
02:48:32,326 --> 02:48:33,427
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got a ton of questions tonight.

1999
02:48:33,507 --> 02:48:36,087
[SPEAKER_04]: I begged twice and I got tons of questions the second time.

2000
02:48:36,788 --> 02:48:44,570
[SPEAKER_04]: Rini wants to know, my question is someone to please describe quest mode in Ultramix 3 if they've played it at E3.

2001
02:48:46,678 --> 02:48:49,540
[SPEAKER_04]: Shane probably can't really say anything about quest mode.

2002
02:48:50,620 --> 02:48:51,821
[SPEAKER_04]: Super deformed characters.

2003
02:48:52,061 --> 02:48:54,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the characters are like the giant heads.

2004
02:48:54,502 --> 02:48:58,765
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, you move across the capitals of the United States, starting in Sacramento.

2005
02:48:58,805 --> 02:48:59,245
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.

2006
02:49:00,566 --> 02:49:07,609
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it costs points to move around the map, and you earn points by playing the song in the city.

2007
02:49:08,490 --> 02:49:10,991
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it like a challenge that you had to do or something?

2008
02:49:11,451 --> 02:49:11,912
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, guess what?

2009
02:49:11,932 --> 02:49:13,693
[SPEAKER_07]: Quest mode kind of changed since E3.

2010
02:49:14,073 --> 02:49:14,373
[SPEAKER_07]: Did it?

2011
02:49:14,433 --> 02:49:14,913
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2012
02:49:15,133 --> 02:49:16,194
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you tell us anything new about it?

2013
02:49:16,738 --> 02:49:21,260
[SPEAKER_07]: No, you can continue though, because it follows the same basic principle you're talking about.

2014
02:49:21,300 --> 02:49:21,740
[SPEAKER_04]: Bastard.

2015
02:49:22,220 --> 02:49:28,883
[SPEAKER_04]: So you earn, I guess, points by playing the song in the city and then you can move around the map, and I suppose that... You pick up more players as you go.

2016
02:49:28,923 --> 02:49:30,043
[SPEAKER_04]: I think so, yeah, you pick up more players.

2017
02:49:30,324 --> 02:49:34,525
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm assuming that this is going to be how a shitload of things unlock in Ultimix 3, or however many.

2018
02:49:35,146 --> 02:49:38,727
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the goal is to ultimately conquer all 50 states.

2019
02:49:39,747 --> 02:49:42,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Or maybe it's just 48 continental, I don't know.

2020
02:49:42,869 --> 02:49:44,129
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where you're wrong!

2021
02:49:44,529 --> 02:49:44,910
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, really?

2022
02:49:44,970 --> 02:49:45,710
[SPEAKER_04]: It's around the world.

2023
02:49:46,479 --> 02:49:47,660
[SPEAKER_07]: That's where you're wrong!

2024
02:49:48,020 --> 02:49:48,460
[SPEAKER_10]: Canada?

2025
02:49:48,480 --> 02:49:50,681
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh god, do you have to go to Mexico?

2026
02:49:51,401 --> 02:49:52,122
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope not.

2027
02:49:52,622 --> 02:49:54,543
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't play DDR in Mexico, it's pumping up there.

2028
02:49:54,863 --> 02:49:55,783
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it actually is.

2029
02:49:56,104 --> 02:49:56,444
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright.

2030
02:49:59,965 --> 02:50:02,066
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, um, let's see.

2031
02:50:02,306 --> 02:50:05,508
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can't tell us anything about what might have changed, not anything?

2032
02:50:06,448 --> 02:50:07,009
[SPEAKER_04]: I really can't.

2033
02:50:07,629 --> 02:50:14,092
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just, it's not that big a difference, but there are some subtle changes to it that... Alright, we'll see.

2034
02:50:15,006 --> 02:50:17,447
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, Rini also wants to know... Oh, you will see.

2035
02:50:18,528 --> 02:50:23,490
[SPEAKER_04]: Rini wants to know, oh, and when are you guys going to do some online Ultramix 2 tournament?

2036
02:50:24,010 --> 02:50:24,751
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, that's a good idea.

2037
02:50:24,811 --> 02:50:25,851
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometime before Ultramix 3.

2038
02:50:25,971 --> 02:50:28,733
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, in the next couple months when we stop being lazy.

2039
02:50:28,753 --> 02:50:34,015
[SPEAKER_04]: We're trying to plan a real DDR tournament, um, and I'm trying to go to the tournament back east as well.

2040
02:50:34,596 --> 02:50:36,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it shouldn't be that hard.

2041
02:50:36,837 --> 02:50:43,420
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll maybe start a forum, or a thread in the forums and see if there's enough interest in it, because last time we tried to do it, like, nobody wanted to play.

2042
02:50:44,254 --> 02:50:47,837
[SPEAKER_04]: We will see.

2043
02:50:47,957 --> 02:50:50,559
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll post a thread in the forums and see what we get out of that.

2044
02:50:51,159 --> 02:50:54,362
[SPEAKER_04]: Socorino wants to know, what is the official release date for Xtreme 2?

2045
02:50:56,563 --> 02:50:57,544
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll field that one.

2046
02:50:59,045 --> 02:51:02,848
[SPEAKER_02]: It's September, I want to say, 27th.

2047
02:51:03,228 --> 02:51:05,750
[SPEAKER_02]: That might be the 26th.

2048
02:51:05,970 --> 02:51:09,093
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's the last week of September.

2049
02:51:09,113 --> 02:51:09,193
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

2050
02:51:09,881 --> 02:51:15,826
[SPEAKER_04]: Sakurina also wants to know, does Konami of America plan on releasing Dancing Stage featuring System of a Down anytime soon?

2051
02:51:16,206 --> 02:51:17,487
[SPEAKER_04]: I will go ahead and answer that question.

2052
02:51:17,707 --> 02:51:17,927
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

2053
02:51:18,888 --> 02:51:20,289
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I answer it too?

2054
02:51:21,550 --> 02:51:22,091
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

2055
02:51:22,871 --> 02:51:25,554
[SPEAKER_04]: Sakurina, oh, that's the official word from a Konami person, by the way.

2056
02:51:25,954 --> 02:51:28,616
[SPEAKER_04]: Sakurina also wants to know, where do babies come from?

2057
02:51:29,377 --> 02:51:30,718
[SPEAKER_04]: Vaginas, actually.

2058
02:51:36,929 --> 02:51:37,709
[SPEAKER_04]: Dark Knight.

2059
02:51:38,749 --> 02:51:39,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, never mind.

2060
02:51:39,370 --> 02:51:41,450
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a personal thing he's sharing with me.

2061
02:51:42,231 --> 02:51:45,232
[SPEAKER_04]: Xander C wants to know, I can't read it anyway if it's personal.

2062
02:51:45,632 --> 02:51:49,973
[SPEAKER_04]: Xander C wants to know, why did Konami kill off Parapara anyways?

2063
02:51:50,554 --> 02:51:56,636
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like they knew I'd like the game later and killed it off just to get me even more pissed than when they started attacking in the groove.

2064
02:51:56,736 --> 02:51:59,737
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the same reason why Billy Ray Cyrus doesn't make any more music.

2065
02:52:00,157 --> 02:52:02,218
[SPEAKER_02]: It's because it's not popular anymore.

2066
02:52:03,398 --> 02:52:06,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though there's a lot of sarcasm there, there is some truth.

2067
02:52:06,280 --> 02:52:09,842
[SPEAKER_04]: From what I understand, Parapara kind of went downhill in Japan for a little while.

2068
02:52:09,883 --> 02:52:10,623
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was a fad.

2069
02:52:10,743 --> 02:52:11,343
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all it was.

2070
02:52:11,363 --> 02:52:14,005
[SPEAKER_04]: But it seems like it's still going on.

2071
02:52:14,065 --> 02:52:17,007
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you still see Eurobeats big with initial D and stuff.

2072
02:52:17,087 --> 02:52:18,788
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a hard time believing it's dead altogether.

2073
02:52:22,231 --> 02:52:22,891
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess here it is.

2074
02:52:23,311 --> 02:52:24,872
[SPEAKER_04]: Why did Keyboard Mania stop?

2075
02:52:24,932 --> 02:52:26,432
[SPEAKER_04]: Why did Dance Maniacs stop?

2076
02:52:26,492 --> 02:52:32,614
[SPEAKER_04]: Why did any of those great Bomani series that we don't come to love until long after they stopped, stop?

2077
02:52:32,754 --> 02:52:33,954
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they didn't make enough money.

2078
02:52:34,194 --> 02:52:35,394
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't sell enough machines.

2079
02:52:35,914 --> 02:52:36,274
[SPEAKER_04]: The end.

2080
02:52:37,135 --> 02:52:37,815
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the reason.

2081
02:52:38,755 --> 02:52:40,635
[SPEAKER_04]: Infer what you want about the culture and the pop thing.

2082
02:52:40,896 --> 02:52:42,536
[SPEAKER_04]: If it didn't make money, that's why it didn't continue.

2083
02:52:42,976 --> 02:52:46,777
[SPEAKER_04]: But then again, DDR was making money, but whatever.

2084
02:52:48,860 --> 02:52:49,300
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.

2085
02:52:50,440 --> 02:52:52,141
[SPEAKER_04]: We could argue about that till we're blue in the face.

2086
02:52:54,561 --> 02:52:59,102
[SPEAKER_04]: Legend of Zaku says, Hmm, I wonder what surprises wait for us on the song list for Ultramix 3.

2087
02:52:59,622 --> 02:53:01,423
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if we told you, Zaku, they wouldn't be a surprise.

2088
02:53:02,263 --> 02:53:06,704
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, is it just me or is My My My from EX2 a damn good song to freestyle to?

2089
02:53:07,464 --> 02:53:09,284
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm white, therefore I can't freestyle.

2090
02:53:09,404 --> 02:53:10,565
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a good song.

2091
02:53:10,805 --> 02:53:12,425
[SPEAKER_07]: It's one of my favorites, that's for sure.

2092
02:53:13,405 --> 02:53:14,685
[SPEAKER_04]: The background cracks me up, too.

2093
02:53:15,386 --> 02:53:17,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Initial D... Okay, Jamie's...

2094
02:53:17,828 --> 02:53:18,549
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2095
02:53:37,828 --> 02:53:39,949
[SPEAKER_04]: Legend of Zaku said, this one's for Miklatov.

2096
02:53:40,009 --> 02:53:43,450
[SPEAKER_04]: Will Quest Mode make stops at New York City or the East Coast?

2097
02:53:44,551 --> 02:53:47,192
[SPEAKER_04]: He can't really answer questions about Quest Mode because he's under NDA.

2098
02:53:47,592 --> 02:53:48,332
[SPEAKER_04]: I will answer, though.

2099
02:53:48,372 --> 02:53:51,993
[SPEAKER_04]: From what I saw at E3, it looks like you were stopping in the capital of every state.

2100
02:53:52,434 --> 02:53:54,835
[SPEAKER_04]: So you wouldn't stop in New York City, but Albany.

2101
02:53:55,615 --> 02:53:55,835
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

2102
02:53:56,771 --> 02:53:57,232
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura says...

2103
02:54:24,122 --> 02:54:27,615
[SPEAKER_04]: Why the fuck does southern style iced tea taste so heavenly?

2104
02:54:28,823 --> 02:54:29,143
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

2105
02:54:29,183 --> 02:54:29,544
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

2106
02:54:29,564 --> 02:54:38,090
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to have iced tea at Cracker Barrel, which is as close to Southern Stylist as I'll get, but I didn't get the chance to do that while I was visiting the East Coast.

2107
02:54:38,390 --> 02:54:39,651
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a question for her.

2108
02:54:40,452 --> 02:54:42,554
[SPEAKER_04]: Why aren't you here supporting Pump It Up?

2109
02:54:43,254 --> 02:54:47,317
[SPEAKER_04]: She can't because of her... She was at Classic Gaming Expo and she hurt her hip.

2110
02:54:47,377 --> 02:54:49,739
[SPEAKER_02]: And she was partially turned into an evil warlord.

2111
02:54:49,979 --> 02:54:50,860
[SPEAKER_02]: That was really cool.

2112
02:54:51,460 --> 02:54:52,661
[SPEAKER_04]: She was already an evil warlord.

2113
02:54:52,741 --> 02:54:54,663
[SPEAKER_02]: That is going in the next intro.

2114
02:54:54,683 --> 02:54:55,303
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for sure.

2115
02:54:56,765 --> 02:54:58,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Smackman would like to know

2116
02:54:59,560 --> 02:55:03,242
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do only the crappy songs get stuck in your head?

2117
02:55:05,183 --> 02:55:06,664
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you listen to bad music.

2118
02:55:07,424 --> 02:55:08,545
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a very good question.

2119
02:55:09,105 --> 02:55:11,786
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just Murphy's Law that bad songs are going to get stuck in your head.

2120
02:55:12,226 --> 02:55:14,688
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know, you know, it's just a fact of life.

2121
02:55:14,828 --> 02:55:16,329
[SPEAKER_04]: So I leave you with this.

2122
02:55:17,009 --> 02:55:18,330
[SPEAKER_15]: This is a good song.

2123
02:55:18,350 --> 02:55:21,871
[SPEAKER_15]: Enjoy, courtesy of Orange Lounge Radio.

2124
02:55:32,710 --> 02:55:39,054
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, Spiritsnare, question, do you get to kill Naoki as an extra stage in quest mode?

2125
02:55:39,434 --> 02:55:47,098
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I will answer that question, no you do not, and I don't work for Konami and I haven't seen the game outside of E3, but I just know the answer is no, I'm sorry to say.

2126
02:55:48,018 --> 02:55:50,820
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but it changed since E3.

2127
02:55:51,400 --> 02:55:53,401
[SPEAKER_04]: Dun dun dun!

2128
02:55:55,222 --> 02:55:59,945
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, uh, Addendum, do you get to kill Jack Thompson as a one more extra stage in quest mode?

2129
02:56:01,193 --> 02:56:02,334
[SPEAKER_04]: I will also answer that question.

2130
02:56:02,394 --> 02:56:02,874
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you do not.

2131
02:56:03,194 --> 02:56:03,695
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry to say.

2132
02:56:04,055 --> 02:56:05,716
[SPEAKER_04]: And Konami, could you confirm that?

2133
02:56:06,697 --> 02:56:07,337
[SPEAKER_04]: Our Konami rep?

2134
02:56:07,677 --> 02:56:08,438
[SPEAKER_07]: Konami.

2135
02:56:08,518 --> 02:56:09,639
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm all of Konami.

2136
02:56:09,679 --> 02:56:10,259
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, basically.

2137
02:56:10,779 --> 02:56:12,620
[SPEAKER_04]: When it comes to this question, yes, you are.

2138
02:56:14,702 --> 02:56:23,587
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate him as much as you guys do, but he provides entertainment for the morning every day for me because he always does something new and stupid, so I don't want him dead.

2139
02:56:24,088 --> 02:56:25,849
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want him to shut up.

2140
02:56:26,690 --> 02:56:28,111
[SPEAKER_07]: So please quit trying to kill him.

2141
02:56:28,731 --> 02:56:32,172
[SPEAKER_02]: Besides, there's plenty more games for him to be angry over, you know, come fall.

2142
02:56:32,452 --> 02:56:36,034
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so, I mean, we've just hit the tip of the iceberg.

2143
02:56:36,734 --> 02:56:38,255
[SPEAKER_07]: It's gonna get a lot better, I'm sure.

2144
02:56:39,135 --> 02:56:42,556
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, when Titanic hit the tip of the iceberg, it didn't get much better.

2145
02:56:46,378 --> 02:56:48,539
[SPEAKER_04]: It's almost like the living room had heard that joke.

2146
02:56:51,200 --> 02:56:53,201
[SPEAKER_04]: God, sometimes I wish we were a TV show, seriously.

2147
02:56:56,002 --> 02:56:56,282
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway,

2148
02:56:57,493 --> 02:56:58,634
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got to start wrapping up the show.

2149
02:56:58,674 --> 02:57:03,239
[SPEAKER_04]: However, there's one more question, so I'm going to be nice and take this question because we started a little late anyway.

2150
02:57:03,980 --> 02:57:10,226
[SPEAKER_04]: Rene wants to know, Why doesn't Konami bring back hold notes and scratches in Beatmania 2DX?

2151
02:57:10,827 --> 02:57:15,532
[SPEAKER_04]: Rene would like to point out, scratches were in Beatmania the final and hold notes in Beatmania 3, I believe.

2152
02:57:15,885 --> 02:57:17,006
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2153
02:57:44,363 --> 02:57:47,312
[SPEAKER_04]: As far as Konami in Japan, I couldn't tell you, but look at this.

2154
02:57:47,870 --> 02:57:56,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Beatmania 5 key songs are making its way into the US, and you can already see that Konami US is doing its own thing with Beatmania.

2155
02:57:56,692 --> 02:58:00,233
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, they have the balls to change the interface, for one, to a new color.

2156
02:58:00,513 --> 02:58:03,214
[SPEAKER_04]: Granted, it's just a new color, but it's something.

2157
02:58:03,854 --> 02:58:05,615
[SPEAKER_04]: It's also Happy Sky Difficulty Names.

2158
02:58:06,115 --> 02:58:10,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, and rumor is that the controllers are going to be different.

2159
02:58:10,116 --> 02:58:11,136
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's not a rumor.

2160
02:58:11,376 --> 02:58:17,078
[SPEAKER_07]: Enos confirmed it in an interview on, I think, GameSpot.

2161
02:58:17,608 --> 02:58:20,370
[SPEAKER_07]: They have the rounded edges and they address the buttons.

2162
02:58:20,550 --> 02:58:21,130
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, super.

2163
02:58:21,350 --> 02:58:24,572
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought that was something that... Yeah, anyway.

2164
02:58:24,872 --> 02:58:33,477
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, I'm hoping that they bring actual hold keys, for example, like in Keyboard Mania or in Easy to DJ.

2165
02:58:34,157 --> 02:58:36,298
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be awesome if they implemented that later on.

2166
02:58:36,618 --> 02:58:39,020
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would say probably not this mix.

2167
02:58:39,540 --> 02:58:44,605
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, they're going to want to have things later on that kind of make their mixes like, ooh, it's the new thing in this mix.

2168
02:58:45,265 --> 02:58:46,586
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't count it out for the U.S.

2169
02:58:46,647 --> 02:58:46,947
[SPEAKER_04]: mixes.

2170
02:58:47,087 --> 02:58:49,289
[SPEAKER_04]: I seriously, I would say don't count it out for the U.S.

2171
02:58:49,469 --> 02:58:49,990
[SPEAKER_04]: later mixes.

2172
02:58:50,270 --> 02:58:56,115
[SPEAKER_07]: So long as you guys support it and buy it, because, I mean, if it tanks, well, it's on you.

2173
02:58:56,195 --> 02:59:02,761
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm at least buying a controller to replace my old one, because I'm excited about the idea of the new controller, so we'll see.

2174
02:59:03,516 --> 02:59:04,177
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Blame TV.

2175
02:59:04,217 --> 02:59:04,377
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

2176
02:59:28,562 --> 02:59:31,585
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, that's going to do it for tonight's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

2177
02:59:31,605 --> 02:59:34,187
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you guys so much for tuning in and listening to and supporting us.

2178
02:59:34,227 --> 02:59:34,828
[SPEAKER_04]: We appreciate it.

2179
02:59:34,868 --> 02:59:37,450
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't forget, we also have a live show on Tuesday night.

2180
02:59:37,490 --> 02:59:39,932
[SPEAKER_04]: That's Pump Up the Volume with the one and only DarkSakura.

2181
02:59:40,433 --> 02:59:42,715
[SPEAKER_04]: And I will be bringing a show back very soon.

2182
02:59:42,735 --> 02:59:46,859
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I've said that for like the past seven weeks, but I got very sick this week, so that's why I didn't do it.

2183
02:59:47,399 --> 02:59:48,200
[SPEAKER_04]: But maybe this next week.

2184
02:59:48,760 --> 02:59:51,523
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, more exciting stuff coming to Orange Lounge Radio.

2185
02:59:52,903 --> 02:59:53,824
[SPEAKER_04]: Also the podcast.

2186
02:59:54,904 --> 02:59:58,185
[SPEAKER_04]: We have an unbelievable amount of listeners on the podcast.

2187
02:59:58,225 --> 02:59:59,945
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you guys so much for your support of the podcast.

2188
02:59:59,985 --> 03:00:00,566
[SPEAKER_04]: It's crazy.

2189
03:00:00,906 --> 03:00:03,887
[SPEAKER_02]: We're also working on something for those PSP owners out there.

2190
03:00:04,067 --> 03:00:04,787
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's going to be great.

2191
03:00:05,027 --> 03:00:10,068
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're hoping to have a breakthrough on that, being the first online station to have something like that.

2192
03:00:10,188 --> 03:00:10,709
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll see.

2193
03:00:11,189 --> 03:00:13,029
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, thank you guys for your support.

2194
03:00:13,069 --> 03:00:13,690
[SPEAKER_04]: We appreciate you.

2195
03:00:13,730 --> 03:00:13,950
[SPEAKER_04]: Love you.

2196
03:00:15,728 --> 03:00:16,429
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

2197
03:00:30,976 --> 03:00:33,637
[SPEAKER_07]: I ate too much Taco Bell, now my stomach hurts.

2198
03:00:34,197 --> 03:00:36,718
[SPEAKER_07]: And two, does anybody want to go to work for me tomorrow?

2199
03:00:36,738 --> 03:00:37,338
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I don't.

2200
03:00:39,459 --> 03:00:40,260
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, your final thought.

2201
03:00:41,480 --> 03:00:52,524
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got to bring over next week the iToy, because I have, and the microphone, because I have SingStar Pop, that one we've got to try out.

2202
03:00:52,584 --> 03:00:53,325
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I want to see that.

2203
03:00:53,485 --> 03:00:56,706
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I also have iToy, Harry Potter iToys,

2204
03:00:57,045 --> 03:01:01,806
[SPEAKER_02]: Sega, and iToyPlay, and I think I'm going to try to get Play 2 as well.

2205
03:01:02,087 --> 03:01:12,630
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though DarkSakura, I think, called it a bastardization of the original Samba de Amigo, I really want to play the iToySamba, because I didn't get to play it at E3.

2206
03:01:13,190 --> 03:01:14,750
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't want to misquote her.

2207
03:01:14,770 --> 03:01:16,351
[SPEAKER_04]: She might not have said that, but I'm pretty sure she didn't.

2208
03:01:16,883 --> 03:01:19,805
[SPEAKER_04]: It should be fun.

2209
03:01:19,825 --> 03:01:22,586
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, there's that.

2210
03:01:22,846 --> 03:01:26,729
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, um, I've got an actual, um, another import I gotta try.

2211
03:01:26,769 --> 03:01:30,030
[SPEAKER_02]: It's another street racing game store, like, initially.

2212
03:01:30,251 --> 03:01:39,896
[SPEAKER_02]: They need to put, um, what is it, um, Midnight Toon on their Wangdangs, Midnight Maximum Toon on the console systems, because that'd be awesome.

2213
03:01:40,316 --> 03:01:41,297
[SPEAKER_02]: That game's actually pretty cool.

2214
03:01:42,417 --> 03:01:42,658
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

2215
03:01:43,758 --> 03:01:44,879
[SPEAKER_04]: Alrighty, um...

2216
03:01:46,080 --> 03:01:56,148
[SPEAKER_04]: and I would just like to say thank you guys very much for listening and I hope I feel better next week and I'm just looking forward to getting in some major gaming this next week with my brand new PlayStation.

2217
03:01:57,970 --> 03:02:03,614
[SPEAKER_04]: And on behalf of DarkSakura I'd like to say reject false icons because you know that's her thing and what she'd say if she were here.

2218
03:02:04,255 --> 03:02:05,276
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's it.

2219
03:02:05,336 --> 03:02:06,417
[SPEAKER_04]: The final word of the show.

2220
03:02:06,577 --> 03:02:07,698
[SPEAKER_04]: One word to sum it all up.

2221
03:02:08,158 --> 03:02:09,439
[SPEAKER_04]: The one and only Miklatov.

2222
03:02:12,401 --> 03:02:12,661
[SPEAKER_12]: What?

2223
03:02:12,682 --> 03:02:13,222
[SPEAKER_12]: What?

2224
03:02:14,770 --> 03:02:19,653

2229
