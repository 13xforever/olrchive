74
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,800
Baby, now that we're together, you and me

75
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:45,400
Look at us, baby, look at us now

76
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,900
Like the power of the wind, the glowin' of the moon

77
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:52,700
Look at us, baby, look at us now

78
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:56,000
Baby, from the way that we can ever be

79
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,700
Look at us, baby, look at us now

80
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:03,200
Now all the good is gone, I knew it all the time

81
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,900
We'd make it today, look at us now

82
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,380
This is what you're gonna...

83
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:26,220
We are what we're supposed to be

84
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,980
Illusions are the fantasy

85
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:31,540
Under the light, we can face

86
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:34,740
What you do is what you wish to do

87
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,240
We are the call to save our days

88
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,740
We do the things you want to see

89
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:42,740
Bring my brain to the X-ray

90
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:45,740
Our friends are so unreasonable

91
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:48,740
They do the unpredictable

92
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:50,740
All out alive if we can say

93
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:54,240
What we do and what can we do?

94
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,740
There's all an order for friends

95
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:59,240
Doing all the little things

96
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,740
Bring my brain to the X-ray

97
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:04,740
One by one we make it in five

98
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:07,740
We are the time to be heroes of the world

99
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:10,740
We are the ones who got our hands on our robot

100
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,740
It's game by your back, rage in mind

101
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,740
One of the wildest of our days

102
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:17,740
I'll never get to fight back

103
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:18,740
We're on the move, we're on the path

104
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:21,740
Time to run, to qualify

105
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:22,740
We come to the end

106
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:23,740
We're never gonna land

107
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:27,740
We're the man, we're the man, we're the kind of people, kind of people, kind of people, yeah

108
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:47,740
Often you just walk away from me

109
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:50,740
When all I can do is watch you leave

110
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:54,740
Cause we shared the laughter and the pain

111
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:57,740
And even shared the tears

112
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:03,740
You're the only one who really knew me at all

113
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:07,740
So take a look at me now

114
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:10,740
You're very open as you say

115
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:14,740
And you coming back to me is against the odds

116
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:19,740
And that's why I'm not afraid

117
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:23,740
I wish I could just make you turn around

118
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:26,740
Turn around and make me cry

119
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:30,740
There's so much I need to say to you

120
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:33,740
So many reasons why

121
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:39,740
You're the only one who really knew me at all

122
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:43,740
So take a look at me now

123
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:51,340
There's just a lefty thing And there's nothing left here to remind me

124
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:57,340
Just a memory of a friend Take a good look at me now

125
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:03,340
Cause I can still be standing here If you turn it back to me

126
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:10,840
If you get caught up, the chance I've got to pay

127
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:36,140
Bring me back to Rainbow Track

128
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:39,040
Give me your gun and my hand

129
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,840
I wanna be your shooting man

130
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,540
Left by left

131
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:47,340
The military staff

132
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:50,140
The air force raft

133
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:53,140
The 70 is the best

134
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:55,840
Go left or right, don't pick up the map

135
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,840
Go left or right, go left

136
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:44,560
Go left, go right, go pick up set, go left, go right, go left.

137
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:51,000
Gaming radio, so uncensored, that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.

138
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,120
Mooch, uh, moo-kaw-key.

139
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,120
Orange Lounge Radio.

140
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:05,560
We're back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 154 on this lovely, hot August night

141
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,880
here in the Sacramento area where our show is based.

142
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,460
Welcome to our new listeners.

143
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:11,920
I'm sure we have a couple new listeners tonight.

144
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,840
It seems like ever since we started that little podcast thing, we've been getting a trickle

145
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,120
of new listeners every week to the live show.

146
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,840
So hello to you guys that came over from the podcast.

147
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:24,640
For those of you guys that are expecting a three-hour version of our podcast, we apologize,

148
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:29,640
but that's not what we do here. Because we have three hours to film...

149
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,640
Yeah, we talk about music gaming.

150
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:38,640
Sometimes we talk about music gaming, and then other times we talk about other crazy, much crazier stuff.

151
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,640
So, you're kind of quiet, Loki, all of a sudden.

152
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,640
Well, gee, I'm either too loud or too quiet, you know?

153
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,640
There you go, now we're fine.

154
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,640
Can't win.

155
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:50,640
So what do we do here on the show? We talk about the music-based video games,

156
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,640
which was what our podcast was originally going to be about, but then we got way off track.

157
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:58,880
way off track. And then we also talk about, you know, pop culture stuff when it, you know,

158
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:03,560
comes up, like strippers and things like that. And, you know, just whatever is on our mind.

159
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:06,480
So that means we always start off each and every show with a little bit of how was your

160
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,880
week, how was your day, where we talk about what's been going on for you this week. So

161
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,080
without talking about any of the Bomani news this week that you guys know is coming up

162
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:17,520
later in the show, how was your week, how was your day? We'll start off with Loki, since

163
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,120
Dark Sakura's not here tonight.

164
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,920
My week was pretty good because, um, it just was.

165
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:28,600
I got to play some more games, um, Darkwatch for, you know, briefly.

166
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,120
Then I got bored of Darkwatch after about five minutes just because, you know, first

167
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,120
person shooters, eh, I just didn't have the time to dedicate to it.

168
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:40,440
So Burnout 3 it was because I took down 54 cars in one match, and that was fucking awesome.

169
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:43,880
That was one of the best races I've done.

170
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:48,320
It was just like, I was in the zone, just like, knocking off cars, you know, three at

171
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:53,240
every time and loved it. You have been obsessed with Burnout 3 just like I have been obsessed

172
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:58,680
with Meteos. I cannot stop. And now, Mikoltov is obsessed with Meteos. Well, then also I

173
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:02,820
got to play actual music games. I got to play Taiko no Tatujin while I was waiting for Nelly

174
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:09,240
to get out of the doctors. Um, cause you know, since I, the car. On the PSP. You didn't lug

175
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:15,440
the big drum into the doctor's office or anything. I do lug my PS2 around though. I do do that.

176
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,480
So, and I kid you not, this is how addicted to Burnout 3 I am.

177
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,800
I will lug my PS2, I carry it with me to work.

178
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,240
I'll lug it downstairs, we'll hook it up to the TV, we'll play two races and unhook it

179
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,200
up in a matter of 15 minutes.

180
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,280
That's how addicted we are to this game.

181
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:36,560
But um, so anyways, I got to play a Taika no Tatujin and um, beat about half the songs,

182
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,860
you know, completely 100%.

183
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:41,680
So now I have to figure out what happens when I beat everything.

184
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:54,680
I don't know. It's pretty fun. And that's pretty much all I did that was super exciting. I saw a 40-year-old virgin and that movie is hilarious. I love it. Highly recommend it.

185
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:57,680
Was it funnier than There's Something About Mary? Because that's what a lot of people just say.

186
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:07,680
Yeah. It was one of those movies you actually laugh out loud. It was just really funny. Steve Carell is awesome and all the supporting cast was awesome as well. So, really good movie.

187
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:11,400
uh... coming from the chair of fire above us as uh... any game that enables

188
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:15,480
you to produce final destination to pile up for great

189
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,880
remember the beginning of that

190
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,640
if you want to play her chat

191
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:23,060
and have comments randomly written read on a row orange laundry dot com click on

192
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:23,760
chat back

193
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,320
that's the difference between the show the podcast really is that you get

194
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,560
interact with us the thing is that they have a very three dollars i can find

195
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,400
cheat codes for it

196
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,660
you know it being on my hard drive it makes you a hard to cheat there is a way

197
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:38,740
the Codebreaker version 9, I guess you can do that by 8, so I have to see if I can upgrade

198
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:44,420
that or something. But yeah, it looks like it's going to be really fun, and I'm waiting

199
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:49,900
for Burnout Revenge, because that's next month. I have to play the Madden demo, because they

200
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:50,900
have that on there.

201
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:54,220
Now for those that would say, us a couple folks in chat room are saying that Burnout

202
00:15:54,220 --> 00:16:00,760
3 is not all that. What are the flaws in Burnout 3?

203
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:08,580
The Announcer, Striker, fucking lame ass piece of crap, it's like some, no offense Rob, college

204
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:11,580
DJ, okay, that's on MTV, okay?

205
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,580
Hey!

206
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:13,580
Okay, no.

207
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:14,580
I think I got my start.

208
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:15,580
No, no, no.

209
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:16,580
Hey!

210
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:21,380
You're listening to Chico State Radio, and that was some Beck, comin' up for Beck!

211
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:28,260
No, honestly, it's very annoying, and I've turned the Announcer off a few times and it

212
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,260
keeps coming back.

213
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:40,260
And also, if you don't play the World Race mode right off the bat, you'll keep getting these stupid training videos that pop up, and they're like five minutes long and you can't bypass any of them. That sucks.

214
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:47,260
And also, some of the physics in the game are a little touchy, and the AI is a bit too rubber bandy, and it's just, I don't know.

215
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:53,260
But Burnout Revenge, from what I hear, fixes all of that, and the game is amazing. I can't wait!

216
00:16:53,260 --> 00:17:02,260
Because you can also do, I guess, you can do these where you can make your car explode in Burnout Revenge when you crash and you just go BOOM!

217
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,260
So I love that. Explosions are awesome.

218
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:07,260
Alright. Explosions are awesome.

219
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:10,260
Miklotov, put the game on pause. Tell us about your wig.

220
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:12,260
He's got a mic. He's got Jamie's mic.

221
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:14,260
Um, okay.

222
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:16,260
Oh, now you're loud! Whoa, good. Alright.

223
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:24,260
I play Final Fantasy XI a lot, and I got my artifact armor part of the way for Bard, and it made me very happy.

224
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:32,260
And I was sick Friday. That's about it. And I worked.

225
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,260
You worked a lot this week?

226
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:36,260
Yes, and I hated it. I hated it so much.

227
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:42,260
Don't talk about it, you don't like it. Don't say that when Konami people might be listening to the show, you dumbass.

228
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:47,260
I don't care. I make it known what I like and I don't like at work.

229
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:49,260
Oh, so it's the particular thing you're working on.

230
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,260
Yeah, I hate it.

231
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:52,260
Can you, I guess you probably can't tell us what.

232
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:58,260
No, no. But I hate it. I hate it for ten to twelve hours a day, every day and weekends.

233
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,260
Can you please make sure they don't make any more Frogger games?

234
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:06,260
Because I have to sell this to people and I'm like, it's a Frogger game that's 3D.

235
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:08,260
It's based off the original Frogger.

236
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:10,260
And, well, it's a Frogger game.

237
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:14,260
If you can take care of Hawaii, it's all Hawaii.

238
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:17,260
So, let's just go to Hawaii and beat some people up.

239
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,260
Yeah, I mean, it's that simple.

240
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:19,260
So, wait, can you...

241
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:22,260
Japan needs to, you know, bomb them again.

242
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:25,260
Again, for those who don't know Miklotov, he actually works at Konami.

243
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:28,260
What can you tell us about your job?

244
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:32,260
He's under a lot of non-disclosure agreements, which means if he says things that he's not supposed to,

245
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:34,260
he gets a spanking and possibly fire.

246
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:37,260
He should put a little collar around his neck if he says something he's not supposed to.

247
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,260
That transmits back to the home planet.

248
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:42,260
So what can you say about your job?

249
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:44,260
Well, okay, people know I do DDR.

250
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:49,260
And, um, I mean, if you look at instruction booklets, you see lists of testers and stuff.

251
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:51,260
And so you see my name there, too.

252
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:55,260
So, I mean, you can gather that I test and I do DDR and I do other things.

253
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:59,260
So would it be fair to say, and feel free to say you can't answer if you can't?

254
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,260
I can't answer that what?

255
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:02,260
I didn't even ask!

256
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:04,260
Is DDR the only game you work on?

257
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:06,260
No. No, it's not.

258
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:09,420
Okay. Do you work on games other than Bomani Games?

259
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:13,940
Yes. Okay. I see. So the game he's talking about could be anything?

260
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:17,740
It could be anything, and I hate it so much. Out of curiosity,

261
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:21,420
are there any songs you've been hearing a lot at work lately?

262
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:24,740
Any songs stuck in your head that you've been hearing an awful lot at work?

263
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:28,740
Yeah, the Hum a Few Bars.

264
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:32,940
No. Any songs from any, like, purple looking games

265
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:35,940
that you can think of? Oh, you're talking about Beatmania, aren't you?

266
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:41,500
Okay, hold on. I can clear this up. You know about Beatmania? We don't know anything more

267
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:45,300
than everybody else does. When we saw those pictures for the first time, is when you saw

268
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:49,300
those pictures for the first time. So it was shocking to us to think.

269
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:54,060
But IGN saw them before everybody saw them. I know, they're jerks.

270
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:58,660
He hate IGN. What's up? Can you tell me about this? What

271
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:02,900
the hell is up with GamePro? What the hell? How come they beat you to everything?

272
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:09,000
They're a nobody pays attention to magazine so they can say whatever they want.

273
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,840
They need to say something to get some readers, and they have readers for a day.

274
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:16,960
Disclaimer guys, Miklotov's comments are his own and do not necessarily reflect those economics.

275
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,280
They are one of the EGM, okay?

276
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:25,120
GamePro used to be the shit back in the day when it was GamePro and Nintendo Power.

277
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,160
You know what, you bastards, I used to subscribe to GamePro.

278
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,160
So did I.

279
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:37,160
I was in their little elite club thing that they had for a short while, where there was only like several hundred members because I wrote like a thing in the contest and I won.

280
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:45,160
Yeah, every day they would walk in, see the big list of the club members and go, HA HA HA HA HA! STUPID PEOPLE! HA HA HA HA!

281
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:54,160
See, the only thing I remember from GamePro from my childhood is the two covers, the American Gladiators one, and the Gremlins 2 one, and then everything else is a blur.

282
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,160
Because the American Gladiators one.

283
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:59,060
There's one.

284
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,060
What's that noise?

285
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,060
Forget it.

286
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,060
Forget it.

287
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:07,560
I can't remember when I pinched my cheek at the end of the cover.

288
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,560
Forget it.

289
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,560
Forget it.

290
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,560
It's...

291
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,560
Rob was right as you say that.

292
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,560
He was masturbating to the cover.

293
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,560
Yeah.

294
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,560
When I was nine.

295
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:21,580
This is what we call a radio gag because they can't see that I'm pulling my cheek.

296
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:24,340
It sounds over the sound waves.

297
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:25,340
It sounds like...

298
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:34,340
But see, make it look tough, this is what we do when we don't have sound boards with different audio effects, we have to make them ourselves.

299
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:40,340
But still, I was like 9 when that cover came out, so if you're like saying that I was masturbating at 9...

300
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,340
Dude, some people were!

301
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:45,340
No, people can keep magazines, they don't just disappear.

302
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:48,340
But it had like, laser on the cover!

303
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:50,340
I didn't even remember who was on the cover!

304
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:53,340
It was Gemini, Laser, and some chick.

305
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,340
Okay!

306
00:21:55,340 --> 00:22:00,340
Those Farrah Fawcett posters were in guys' bedrooms for like 25 years.

307
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:01,340
Okay.

308
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:02,340
They need lives, then.

309
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,340
I guess so.

310
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:06,340
And, Loki, what are you talking about that we don't have a soundboard here at the station?

311
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:07,340
God.

312
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,340
God.

313
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:09,340
Damn.

314
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:10,340
Ow, my foot!

315
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:13,340
Why did I shoot myself in my foot?

316
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:17,340
Oh, I have something else.

317
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:18,340
What?

318
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:19,340
Okay, I had to drink.

319
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:27,340
We were at IHOP today, and we were sitting in the back of the place, because that's where they made us sit.

320
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:30,340
And so we're having our normal discussions.

321
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:33,340
X, to Fur, has his little rainbow shirt on.

322
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:36,340
And Justin, I don't know, did you say Jazz or Jazz?

323
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:38,340
Justin, okay.

324
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,340
Sorry, my bad.

325
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:42,340
Because people know you as Jazz online, if anything.

326
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:47,340
Because you're famous, you contributed a story to DDR Freak this week, so you're to famous.

327
00:22:47,340 --> 00:23:02,340
He has a shirt on that says homosexuals are gay, and so we have this big gay group over here and we're talking, and this old lady comes over, and she's like, so they stick all the gay people in the back of the place, or something like that. I wasn't paying attention because I was laughing.

328
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:05,340
Implying that she and her friends were all lesbians. Old lesbians.

329
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:08,340
Yeah, because they were old and girls, and I guess that means they're lesbians.

330
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:10,340
So you don't hide the fact you're queer?

331
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,340
No.

332
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:12,340
Oh, okay. Just curious.

333
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:14,340
Some of our listeners may not know.

334
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:18,340
Oh my god. It's gonna be their live journal post from now on.

335
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:20,340
I know, I'm gonna go angst about it later.

336
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:25,340
That guy on that radio show said he was gay, bah.

337
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:26,340
Oh no.

338
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:29,340
You know, come to think of it, we have an interesting setup tonight because-

339
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:32,340
I know, I was just like, oh wait a second.

340
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:38,340
Loki's sitting in the center of the room, and he's surrounded by a bunch of bags.

341
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:40,340
Eh, I'm used to it.

342
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:44,400
what do you mean you're used to it what do you mean you're used to it

343
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,120
what the hell we shared an apartment for like two years so come on

344
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,720
so when rob had his orgies

345
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:55,080
hey i never had orgies

346
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,540
that was the best spot to see the tv

347
00:23:57,540 --> 00:24:03,920
loki hold on hold on to this biscuit loki close your eyes

348
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:07,860
anyway moving on anything else you want to share about your week

349
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:09,460
Okay, you can go back to Meteos now.

350
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:10,360
Hooray!

351
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,160
Wait, this is the first time you've played Meteos.

352
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,060
Yeah, really, this is pretty much the first time I've played it.

353
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:15,160
Pretty cool, huh?

354
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:15,660
What'd I tell you?

355
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:17,660
I hate it, because there's nothing really to do in it,

356
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,860
but then I just gotta keep moving the stylus,

357
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:23,260
and make blocks fly up, but they fall back down!

358
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:25,860
So, this makes me think of a question.

359
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,960
At Konami, like, are you allowed to play?

360
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,660
Because, you know, you get your breaks and lunch.

361
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:31,560
I'm assuming they don't slave drive you guys too much.

362
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,460
You actually get a break and a lunch, you know.

363
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:35,460
Oh, yeah, we play whatever we want.

364
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:36,460
I play Pump It Up there.

365
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:40,540
So I was going to ask, can you play whatever you want on your breaks?

366
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:45,220
Oh, it was funny, because I was playing Pump It Up, and I was talking to somebody that

367
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:48,620
was a little higher up than me, and I was saying how much I like Pump It Up more than

368
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:53,980
DDR, and then the higher up for all of us came in, and he told him, and I had to explain

369
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:54,980
myself.

370
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:55,980
It was great.

371
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,860
But yeah, I play Pump there.

372
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:02,340
That's pretty much all I do on breaks.

373
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:03,340
That's great.

374
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:07,340
There are a lot of other hot games in the office right now that are not Konami made.

375
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:10,340
Dr. Mario for Nintendo 64?

376
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:16,340
Kind of random. I didn't even know they made Dr. Mario for Nintendo 64.

377
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:20,340
I remember Pokemon Puzzle League, but I don't remember Dr. Mario 64.

378
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:22,340
Like Dr. Mario in Tetris or something?

379
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:24,340
I don't know. That's right.

380
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:28,340
I'm not sure. That, Pump It Up, and Forza Motorsport.

381
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:31,340
That's the ones that get played that aren't Konami games.

382
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:33,100
An enthusiast?

383
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:35,800
Forza Motorsport is what we play there.

384
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:40,300
Nothing else.

385
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:45,100
Oh, and on a... I have to ask, maybe you can't tell me because this is a Konami-related game, but

386
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:47,180
how's the Winx game turning out?

387
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,620
NDA.

388
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:50,660
Damn you.

389
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:55,540
You can't tell me shit about DDR, now you can't tell me shit about the Winx? Winx Club has now been...

390
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:58,540
It's been relabeled as adult only, so, you know.

391
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:01,540
Yes! I mean, dude, the Winx get topless!

392
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:05,540
The Winx Hot Coffee Edition.

393
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:09,540
Honestly, it wouldn't surprise me, but that's all I'll say.

394
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:11,540
Whoa, hey. Alright, moving on.

395
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:13,540
That's what the franchise needs.

396
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:17,540
Um, let's go over to, uh, Justin. How was your week? How was your day, sir?

397
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:20,540
My week was pretty uneventful, uh...

398
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:23,540
I did... I played Final Fantasy for most of the week,

399
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:31,540
And when I wasn't playing Final Fantasy, I was starting up school again, which kind of sucks, but eh, it's something to do, so that's good enough for me.

400
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:39,540
Then on Saturday morning, I drove up here, and we hung out, and we went to IHOP, and that was funny with the lesbians.

401
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:44,540
Because they specifically told me that it was because of my shirt they could tell we were all gay.

402
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:47,540
Yeah, your shirt made us all gay.

403
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:49,540
Yeah, it's great. I love it.

404
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:53,140
Yeah, because gays aren't allowed to associate with straights in public, only behind closed

405
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:54,140
doors, apparently.

406
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:55,140
Yes, indeed.

407
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:56,140
Yeah.

408
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:58,180
Besides that, that's about it.

409
00:26:58,180 --> 00:26:59,180
All right.

410
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:00,180
Yep.

411
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:01,180
Exciting.

412
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:05,300
Extra for anything you want to share?

413
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:08,780
My week was really cool, I guess.

414
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:12,900
I don't know, I watched a lot of South Park.

415
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:16,020
I went to work, I slept.

416
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:19,060
It was very uneventful, but it was good.

417
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:24,060
Ironically, the boring weeks become, you know, the better weeks sometimes, you know.

418
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:28,060
Okay, I have a small little thing to add on to what Christopher just said.

419
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:29,060
Yeah.

420
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:38,060
Now, don't ask me why I was watching UPN, but for some reason UPN was on the TV, and apparently UPN is getting South Park now.

421
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:42,060
And I'm like, what the hell would you want to watch South Park on UPN for?

422
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,060
Wow.

423
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:44,060
You wouldn't.

424
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:45,060
Exactly!

425
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:47,060
Wow.

426
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:54,280
Christopher what else did you watch that rhymes with the 4400? Um, I don't know. Maybe you can tell me the 44

427
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:59,320
Oh, yeah, that rhymes with 44. It's an awesome show. I'm sorry. I forgot to add that to mine and

428
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,320
Shainer miklotov bought me

429
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,340
You can call him Shane. That's all right

430
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:06,900
Oh Shane Shane by the way, but me fine

431
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:11,320
The listeners will just have to draw a chart at home to keep track of okay

432
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:14,160
Here's their online name and here's their real name. So, okay

433
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,840
and

434
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,280
And he got me into Final Fantasy XI.

435
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:21,080
Hooray, I converted somebody.

436
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,080
So yeah.

437
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,080
Yeah, I helped.

438
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:26,840
Oh yeah, and I made Shane watch Mean Girls for the first time, and he loved it.

439
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,600
It's an awesome movie!

440
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:31,960
It's really, really funny.

441
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,640
And today has been cool.

442
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,640
That's good.

443
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,840
I'm glad you're having a cool day.

444
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,480
Alright, um, my week and my day.

445
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:44,260
Actually, I had a pretty shitty week, because I've been sick all week.

446
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:47,420
didn't you can probably hear it now a little bit like I know my voice is

447
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:51,340
usually kind of nasal but especially so tonight because I've I had a sinus

448
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:56,900
infection this week so it was pretty bad weird enough I'm pretty confident that I

449
00:28:56,900 --> 00:29:02,580
caught it on my plane ride back from the East Coast but it the symptoms didn't

450
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:08,540
really set in until Tuesday or Monday night what did you say West Nile it's not

451
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:23,540
It's coming back on the plane.

452
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:27,540
Yeah, it's coming back on the plane. I was pretty sure I caught my sinus infection there.

453
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:31,540
I did not get bit by a mosquito on the plane. They don't let mosquitoes in planes.

454
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:33,540
Stay up on the terrace!

455
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:03,780
This is reaching for a microphone, yes?

456
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,300
You can still call in sick.

457
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:07,300
There's so many people that can work for you.

458
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:09,160
You're just scared of it.

459
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,160
But it's kind of one of those things...

460
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,160
Yeah, you're scared.

461
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,160
I don't want to...

462
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:15,160
I'm not supposed to talk about my job outside my job, but...

463
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,160
Anyway, so how was your day?

464
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,740
Shut up.

465
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:23,080
It's one of those things where if I don't do it myself, I don't know how things are

466
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:26,600
going to be when I get back, and I might be creating more work for myself by calling in

467
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,600
sick.

468
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,600
See what I'm saying?

469
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,600
See what I'm saying?

470
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,600
Take care of yourself first.

471
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,600
Whatever.

472
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,600
I took care of myself.

473
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,600
I slept all night.

474
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,600
It doesn't matter when you're sick.

475
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,600
That's why I have nothing to say about my week because I slept.

476
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:41,520
But I have to admit, I have to admit when I go home and I see you, like, in any, uh,

477
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:46,800
you know, any pose, like, sleeping on the couch is fucking hilarious, because you look

478
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,940
funny when you sleep and you're sick.

479
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:52,500
Rob would also like to add that he will have something to talk about next week because

480
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,120
he has Hello Kitty Roller Rescue.

481
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,120
I did.

482
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:59,640
Loki bought me a copy, or didn't buy me, but obtained me a copy through his work, not through

483
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:03,240
I've been pirating, actually, but through his work, obtained me a copy of Hello Kitty

484
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:07,320
Roller Rescue, so I'm really excited, and have a reason to dust off the GameCube, since

485
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:10,400
otherwise the damn thing wouldn't be getting dusted off until 2006.

486
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:16,640
Yeah, because my work looked at me funny when I was excited to get Hello Kitty Roller Rescue.

487
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:20,520
I'm all, yeah, I'm all, yeah, my friend's gonna love this game, they're all, right,

488
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:26,680
your friend.

489
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,680
That's great.

490
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:31,360
So I didn't sick all week, so I didn't have a chance to do a lot until the weekend.

491
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,320
Now yesterday we took an adventure over to Fry's Electronics, which is the big

492
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,340
electronics store in town,

493
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:38,740
and I finally picked up a US PlayStation 2

494
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:42,100
finally after all this time because I didn't need one for a long time. I had a

495
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:45,940
Japanese PlayStation 2, so I was able to get my, you know, BeatMania 2DX and

496
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:49,620
DDR fix through the Japanese PlayStation, but I was really missing out on

497
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:53,620
everything else. But since I was living with Loki for the past couple years

498
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:59,580
up until April, I was able to abuse his US PlayStation 2, so I never had to buy one.

499
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:03,500
But now that, you know, Extafur isn't quite the gamer I am.

500
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,180
Extafur, do you have any game systems?

501
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:06,180
What do you?

502
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:12,620
I have a GameCube that I love, and, um, that I never play either, and...

503
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:15,500
So we let you on the show because you are a gamer, believe it or not.

504
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,260
I have played a video game before.

505
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:19,780
Okay, that's good.

506
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:21,860
What are your favorite GameCube games?

507
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:24,860
Um, Netroid Prime...

508
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,860
There you go! Alright.

509
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:30,860
Now what did I tell you to say every time somebody brings up Final Fantasy XI?

510
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:33,860
Damn those gills-sells.

511
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:36,860
Gill-sellers. There you go.

512
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:39,860
Them gills-sells, they sell gills all the time.

513
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:42,860
What's a gills-seller?

514
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:49,860
It's one of the people that sells the currency on eBay and fucks up the economy.

515
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:51,860
Oh, well damn them.

516
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:53,860
There you go.

517
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:55,860
So you just have a GameCube, nothing else?

518
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:57,860
I have a GameCube and a Game Boy Advance.

519
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:02,860
And I have PlayStation 2 games and I don't have a PlayStation 2.

520
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:03,860
But you have one, so hey.

521
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:04,860
I have one now?

522
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:05,860
You have a tiny one.

523
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,860
Yes, I bought one of the new minis.

524
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,860
I was going to...go ahead.

525
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:10,860
No, no, go ahead.

526
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:15,860
I was going to get an old style PlayStation 2, but they're kind of hard to find now.

527
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,860
It's because I wanted to put a hard drive in it.

528
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:23,020
I just decided you know fuck it most PlayStation 2 games like 20 bucks now, and there's only a few. I want to play it in your

529
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:24,060
pocket

530
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:28,260
You can still have a hard drive in the mini ones how they have not in it

531
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:30,420
Unless it's USB advanced

532
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:34,620
It's a you can use the USB hard drive supports up to terabyte hard drives

533
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:41,220
And you can it'll run just as fast as running off the CD-ROM not quite faster, but as fast so

534
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:45,060
It is possible you load it on memory card really

535
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:49,060
But I only have to pay like $400 for its terabyte USB.

536
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:55,060
Well, you're not going to buy a terabyte drive. You can get like, you know, a smaller drive, you know, for a lot less.

537
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:57,060
That's true because you can always swap them in and off the computer.

538
00:33:57,060 --> 00:34:03,060
Or you can get one of the enclosures where you can buy just, you know, put any hard drive in there and make it a USB 2.0 drive.

539
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:09,060
Now, too bad you didn't wait, though, because it's dropping down in price to $99.

540
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:10,060
But not until November.

541
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:11,060
Yeah.

542
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:13,060
To compete with Xbox 360. I saved my receipt just in case.

543
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:19,060
Hey Rob, those PlayStation 2's aren't new anymore.

544
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:23,060
They're new to me because nobody I know has one, except me.

545
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:25,060
But they're still not new.

546
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:28,060
They're new to me. I don't care if they're not.

547
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:34,060
Hey, and Xbox 360 is cool because it's going to have Final Fantasy XI, that's why I'm getting it.

548
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:35,060
Which one are you getting?

549
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:39,060
I'm getting the one that's worth the money, not the one that's a $300 doorstop.

550
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:43,060
I love how you come on this program to promote non-Konami games.

551
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:47,060
Yeah, like Pump.

552
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:51,060
We'll get to your Pump story, don't worry.

553
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:55,060
So, I bought my US PlayStation 2,

554
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:59,060
and I bought two games when I bought it. I bought Katamari Damacy, because

555
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:03,060
that's a must-own game now, and Final Fantasy X, because

556
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:07,060
the whole reason I bought one is because I had an urge to go back and play Final Fantasy X.

557
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:10,060
I don't care what you people say, Valve HD 10 was great.

558
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:12,060
I have to bring you back, uh...

559
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:13,060
DDR Extreme?

560
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:14,060
DDR Extreme.

561
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:16,060
Uh, maybe DDR Extreme.

562
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:21,060
Um, no, actually, the DDR Extreme, um, that's being loaned out to someone. I gotta get that back.

563
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:24,060
I have your Max 2 or Max, I think.

564
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,060
Cool.

565
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:26,060
One of them.

566
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:27,060
Cool.

567
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,060
Very cool.

568
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:35,060
So I can play some DDR at home, which I haven't done in probably, you know, a long time.

569
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:45,060
No, I do sometimes, but actually pulling out the dance pad and playing is kind of a chore, especially when we live upstairs. But luckily the downstairs neighbors are kind of cool.

570
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:55,060
Speaking about the downstairs neighbors, are there any British soccer player games that we can talk about? Because they're downstairs right now, I just saw them outside. Anyways, I have to go see them again.

571
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:56,060
We're going to see them again.

572
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:59,060
Winning 11, you can talk about winning 11.

573
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:01,060
We can talk about winning 11, I don't know.

574
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:03,060
Alright, go have fun, Extover.

575
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:10,060
Alright, anyway, I guess what we'll do now, why don't we go to a quick break?

576
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:12,060
Then we're going to come back and talk about some actual Bomani news.

577
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:14,060
Things that are going on in the Bomani world.

578
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:16,060
Yes, let's.

579
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:19,060
Let's. And then we'll also open up the Skype line a little later on in the show.

580
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:32,060
So you guys, if you have anything you want to ask Miklotov or us, you can, because I'm sure folks are going to try and get some information on Miklotov even though he ain't going to tell you anything, but you can try.

581
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:44,060
So we'll open up the skype line for you guys a little later on. So if you guys want to be able to call on the show, you have to head on over to our skype line, www.orangeloungeradio.com and click on interact with us.

582
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:50,060
And meanwhile, we'll do some more announced music for DDR Extreme 2.

583
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:57,060
started off with a little bit of Boom Boom Dollar. We'll be back after this.

584
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:21,160
Go, go, go.

585
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:23,120
Allez, allez, allez.

586
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,100
Allez, allez, allez.

587
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:28,560
Go, go, go, go.

588
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,280
Go, go, go, go.

589
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,240
Go, go, go, go.

590
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:31,740
Go!

591
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,180
This is not the life.

592
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:43,160
This is the world.

593
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,580
No, it's the time.

594
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:46,740
Don't ever stop.

595
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:52,740
We should have known, got up strong We should have known, back to the top

596
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:59,740

00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:58,740
Ooh, better in the decision for the poor, poor poor

601
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:08,740
Ooh, better in the decision for the poor, poor poor

602
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,740
Oh

603
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:43,740
Yeah, baby, this is what I want to do

604
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:47,740
The

605
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:51,740
no

606
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:55,740
no

607
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:59,740
no

608
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:03,740
no

609
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:07,740
no

610
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:11,740
no

611
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:26,740
Clean up the night, clean up the night Clean up the night, clean up the night

612
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:34,740
Why did our feelings die action When we fought satisfaction

613
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:39,740
But our hearts and as always, save me

614
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:41,740
Why?

615
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:44,740
Little love, all this magic

616
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:48,740
Isn't you a kind of tragic?

617
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:52,740
We were here for the best

618
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:56,740
In the heat of the night

619
00:41:56,740 --> 00:42:00,740
Marching close to the fire

620
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:03,740
And the power of our hearts

621
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:06,740
The minute we dive inside

622
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:09,740
In the heat of the night

623
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:13,740
Much is lost through the fire

624
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:16,740
And the power of our hearts

625
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:20,740
The minute we dive inside

626
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:23,740
In the heat of the night

627
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:37,740
It's the heat of the night, the night, the night

628
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:43,740
In the heat of the night, the night, the night

629
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:46,740
From the steps why the orange flag

630
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:49,740
This media stops

631
00:42:49,740 --> 00:43:07,060
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 154 in progress.

632
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:09,180
We were talking a little bit about our weeks and our days.

633
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:11,980
Now we're going to talk a little bit about some things that are going on in the Bumani

634
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:12,980
world.

635
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:18,820
I suppose even though we've really just beat this topic into the freaking ground over the

636
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:25,500
past few episodes, I think we sort of have to kind of say something about the recent

637
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:28,180
developments in the Konami vs. Roxor case.

638
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:30,380
Okay, basically, here it is.

639
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:34,500
I'm just going to give you the short version, then you can say what you want, we'll be done.

640
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:41,660
DDR Freak kind of used their account into the government public system, I think it's

641
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:45,780
called PACER or something, to pull the latest documents in the case, because these are all

642
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:51,780
publicly available documents, it's not, you know, anything that's filed in the court of law, well, almost anything is usually publicly available.

643
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:57,780
So they basically pulled the official response to Konami's original claims.

644
00:43:57,780 --> 00:44:02,780
Rockstar had responded to those on July 25th, so they went ahead and put those on their site.

645
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:10,780
Basically, in short, Rockstar says, we deny, we deny, we deny, we request that Konami's patent on DDR be invalidated.

646
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:14,780
And that's part of a countersuit, which Rockstar went ahead with doing a countersuit there.

647
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:21,420
And then Konami responded on August 15th, nothing really earth shaking there, just basically

648
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:26,180
deny, deny, deny, you know, we'll see you in court type thing.

649
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:30,720
Also posted something called an order for discovery, kind of the most interesting thing

650
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:35,860
in there I think as it was because I don't profess to be a lawyer, so I'm not going to

651
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:39,020
try and make sense of these documents.

652
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:44,240
But the order for discovery has like a timetable of what a possible trial would look like.

653
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:59,240
A trial date would be February of 2007, so this Konami vs. Rockzor bitching would go on well through, like, Extreme 4 and In the Groove 4, so we're screwed either way.

654
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:07,240
If you want to check this out for yourself, www.ddrfreak.com, you can check out the original documents posted there.

655
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:11,560
Loki? Did you check this out? Yeah, briefly.

656
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:15,040
Yeah, it's like, eh, whatever. Yeah. Please

657
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:19,500
make it so Konami can't use their patents so we can steal it!

658
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:22,760
Hey, you know what? In the group, guess what?

659
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:27,080
Rockzor? There's some modifiers that you don't have yet that are in, uh, Pump It Up.

660
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:28,500
Go steal those now.

661
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:33,040
I would, though, would it be stealing, though? Because now they're

662
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:35,440
working with Andamir, which I think would be really

663
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:40,440
It would be funny if those two companies end up merging before 2007.

664
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:44,440
Shut up right now. Don't say such horrible things.

665
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:48,440
If those two companies end up merging before 2007, how is that going to screw everything up?

666
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:57,440
There's a little difference here. I mean, because watching you guys play Pump It Up, you know, today versus watching In The Groove, it's like night and day.

667
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:04,440
I mean, come on. The videos in Pump It Up, phenomenal. The videos in In The Groove, uh...

668
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:06,440
There's videos in In the Groove? No.

669
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:08,440
Yeah, it's just some random crap.

670
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:10,440
Um, the...

671
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:13,440
Just the whole step charts, you know, that's...

672
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:20,440
You know, granted, Pump It Up has some really retarded ones, like 17 difficulty stuff.

673
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:22,440
Which, you know, In the Groove, you know, they're falling behind here.

674
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:24,440
I mean, they're a little ahead of you.

675
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:26,440
So, um...

676
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:27,440
I don't know.

677
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:32,440
To be honest, it's gonna take them In the Groove 4 before this game's even...

678
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:41,440
I mean, that's why I think. I'd like to see something innovative happen. Haven't seen it yet with In the Groove 2.

679
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:44,440
Waiting for In the Groove 3, when it might be good.

680
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:50,440
Did you check out us here locally in our town, Sacramento? We got a new In the Groove 2 machine. Have you checked it out yet?

681
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:55,440
Wow, it's red. And it has more songs. And it's red.

682
00:46:55,440 --> 00:47:10,440
I haven't gone to check it out, but I have a good excuse, because the arcade it's at is right on the same area, or right on the same lot as the state fairgrounds, and the state fair is going on right now, so you can't get a parking space anywhere near the arcade. So, forget it.

683
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:24,440
I'm not gonna pay $10 to go freaking park in the state fair parking lot and go play In the Groove 2 of all things. I mean, even though I try not to take sides in the whole thing.

684
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:28,280
I just don't care anymore. I really don't. The game sucks.

685
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:29,960
That's the way I think, you know.

686
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:33,160
You love it, good. You like crap. Big deal.

687
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:36,680
I mean, you know what? There are people that like crap out there. I mean, I like bad

688
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:37,580
movies.

689
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:41,760
Some people say, what the hell's wrong with you? But, you know, I like bad movies. I mean, what the hell?

690
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,500
So, if you like, you know,

691
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:48,000
inferior games, if you think it's fun, hey, good. It's your niche. Obviously, someone's

692
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,880
buying them, so somebody out there likes them. Good.

693
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:56,160
Miek Latov, now I know you really, really probably can't comment on these,

694
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:56,680
because

695
00:47:56,680 --> 00:48:00,500
especially in your position, you'd be in a world of hurt, but

696
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:03,960
is there anything you do want to say? I'm taking off my Konami hat for a second.

697
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:08,280
Okay. Okay. In the Groove is stupid. When I read the

698
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:12,280
the countersuit, I thought, you know, wow, you know, Rockstar's really taking a

699
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:14,720
chance with four-year-old lawyers.

700
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:19,360
Actually, apparently, now wait a minute, apparently now in the

701
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:25,260
a little blurb that was written up a little article on DDR Freak by a law student or somebody

702
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:28,500
that has a degree in law. I don't remember the specific scenario, but you can go read

703
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:29,500
it on DDR Freak.

704
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:30,500
I once went to a trial.

705
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:31,500
No, it's not that.

706
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:35,080
Hey, I watch a lot of Law and Order. I know this.

707
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:39,320
The guy, actually, he's a good writer. I'm not going to knock him. It was a good article.

708
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:44,520
But he says in the article that the Roxor legal team is actually a pretty well-respected

709
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:47,000
group from the Bay Area.

710
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:52,560
in the park, you know, in the little sandbox, when they have their little shovels and tails.

711
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:59,760
Um, no, I'm sorry, everything Loki said is how I feel. It's inferior, and Roxor's just

712
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:03,080
whiny because they want money off somebody else's game.

713
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:07,480
Well now, now wait a minute though, here's... I promised myself I wouldn't get into another

714
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:14,160
lawsuit discussion, but I don't care. I have you here, so... Okay. Roxor, you can look

715
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:19,980
at us like the big corporate evil people that just want money, but think about the people

716
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:25,020
that actually made In The Groove, the team that actually made it before it got absolved

717
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:30,540
into RockSore. These guys were DDR fans that just took their obsession to a really extreme

718
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:35,880
level. Yeah, and you know what, they could have kept it, you know, kind of on the downlow

719
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:41,480
and small and not distributed and sold it for money and tried to say, oh it's better

720
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:47,480
and, oh, we're so cool, we have somebody that uses different aliases also, and all the songs sound the same.

721
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:53,480
You know, good or bad, okay, good or bad, whether whatever you think of in the group, let's put it this way.

722
00:49:53,480 --> 00:50:00,480
DDR, okay? If they were still making, you know, more mixes for the arcade, this would not have even been made.

723
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:10,480
And this game itself is so... I don't even know how they're saying that this is not even, you know, copyright on Dance's Revolution.

724
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:17,280
Honestly, they changed everything, or what they thought they needed to change, so they wouldn't get sued.

725
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:22,380
That is all. Otherwise, it is an exact duplicate of DDR.

726
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:27,580
Yeah, and what makes it better is, oh, In the Groove 2 has DDR songs.

727
00:50:27,580 --> 00:50:31,880
You know what's going to be interesting? Yeah, I know. I always thought that's very weird.

728
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:34,580
Why are they trying to copy DDR and go off to those lines?

729
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:40,080
It's like, hey, we're getting away with this. Now we're just going to put your songs in here too and make quote-unquote better steps.

730
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:45,580
Here's the interesting thing, though. Imagine this. Whether you're on the in-the-group side or on the DDR side or on the don't-give-a-shit side,

731
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:53,080
picture this. The jury trial that might happen if they don't settle, might happen in 2007.

732
00:50:53,080 --> 00:51:00,580
They're going to show a jury these two games. This jury will not have a DDR or in-the-group fan on it, no matter what,

733
00:51:00,580 --> 00:51:09,080
because if people consider themselves a fan of that game, the lawyer from the opposing side is going to boot them off the jury, no question.

734
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:12,240
So there will not be any DDR in the group fans on this jury.

735
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:14,900
You show somebody who isn't familiar with these dancing games, these two games side

736
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:15,900
by side.

737
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:18,580
They'll be like, that's the exact same game.

738
00:51:18,580 --> 00:51:22,620
That's just all, just draw your own conclusions, just picture that.

739
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:24,380
That's where this could be headed.

740
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:29,180
That's why I'm kind of surprised that we're not talking settlement yet, but maybe that's

741
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:30,180
still a few months off.

742
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:33,260
They've got to whip their dicks out in the legal sense first.

743
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:40,260
There's some rumblings that's going to kind of change things from not the Konami side.

744
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:42,260
Oh. I was like, don't say too much.

745
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:44,260
No, no, no, no. It has nothing to do with Konami.

746
00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:45,260
Okay.

747
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:50,260
Yeah, if what I've heard goes through, I don't even know what's going to happen after that.

748
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:51,260
Interesting.

749
00:51:51,260 --> 00:51:52,260
Yeah.

750
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:54,260
Very interesting. Okay.

751
00:51:54,260 --> 00:51:58,260
And I don't want it to go through. At all.

752
00:51:58,260 --> 00:51:59,260
Bye.

753
00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:00,260
Oh, I think I know what you're talking about.

754
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:01,260
Yeah.

755
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:02,260
Can I say it?

756
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:07,260
I mean, I just heard it randomly from a respected source, so...

757
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:11,260
Everybody said this, the rumors that Andamiro is going to buy Rockstar.

758
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:17,260
Yeah, and that will make me very angry, because I'll be very angry.

759
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:20,260
That rumor's been going around ever since Andamiro published.

760
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:24,260
Well, you know, I would rather see Andamiro take on, you know, in the groove

761
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:27,260
and actually be able to develop, because obviously it looks like their programmers

762
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:30,260
and game designers know what the fuck they're doing versus these guys.

763
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:36,260
I mean, these guys may have taken an okay direction, but Andamiro is going to be the one that's going to put the polish on things.

764
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:45,260
But the weird thing, if Andamiro were to absolve Roxor or whatever, Andamiro and Konami kind of have that agreement where...

765
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:47,260
They pay money to put out games.

766
00:52:47,260 --> 00:52:51,260
Yeah, the games can coexist. They basically have that, these games can coexist agreement, whatever that may be.

767
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:53,260
That's why it's going to be weird.

768
00:52:53,260 --> 00:53:00,260
Well, you know, it's weird, but hey, if they want to, you know, draw a truce or whatever, I'm fine with it.

769
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:06,260
You know, a little healthy competition never hurt anybody because it'd be an easy win for DDR, but, you know.

770
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:09,260
So you're okay with In the Groove being out there and making new mixes?

771
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:13,260
I'm fine with it being out there. If I don't like the game, I don't play it. That's pretty simple.

772
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:18,260
I mean, it's not like I'm forced to play it when I walk into an arcade, so, you know what?

773
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:25,260
You know what? I've played worse. I've played worse games out there. Hell, I've played a lot of dancing games that have just...

774
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:30,260
I've played that one game that was like Eye Toy Groove, okay? That was an arcade game. I mean, that game...

775
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:32,260
Eye Can Dance? Or Eye Can Boogie?

776
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:39,260
Eye Can Boogie. That game sucks ass, okay? This is in a whole new dimension of crap, okay?

777
00:53:39,260 --> 00:53:42,260
That In The Groove would never, ever be able to touch.

778
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:47,500
And I've played Dance Station 3DDX, which is really interesting.

779
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:51,940
You know, that one's a real weird game, but I found it to be pretty fun.

780
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:53,900
So who cares?

781
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:55,020
Put another game out there.

782
00:53:55,020 --> 00:53:57,100
Give some people some choice, you know?

783
00:53:57,100 --> 00:54:00,140
All right, all right.

784
00:54:00,140 --> 00:54:04,100
Extrofer, Justin, anything you guys want to say about this whole thing?

785
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:06,260
Nothing?

786
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:10,540
Extrofer's like, I don't know what you're talking about.

787
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:11,660
What do you think, Extrofer?

788
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:14,660
Well, okay, I'm actually curious of your perspective, but he hasn't really...

789
00:54:14,660 --> 00:54:16,660
Have you seen the In the Groove game at all?

790
00:54:16,660 --> 00:54:17,660
At the bowling alley?

791
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:19,660
I did see it at the bowling alley, yes.

792
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:23,660
Okay, now you're someone who doesn't play dance games really an awful lot.

793
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:26,660
Like maybe we made you get up there once or twice, but you don't really play the dance games.

794
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:31,660
Well, you know, I play when I go back home to, you know, where I grew up.

795
00:54:31,660 --> 00:54:32,660
Right.

796
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:34,660
And my sister plays DDR.

797
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:40,660
Okay, so I'm curious, as somebody who is not a hardcore fan of these two games, what do you think?

798
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:45,360
think? Is one game a rip-off of the other?

799
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:52,500
I think that In the Groove game looked a lot like DDR. I mean, it just looked like the

800
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:59,060
other game, but the only difference was they had those like bombs or mines or whatever.

801
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:02,980
That was like the only difference. It basically was DDR. I don't know. That's what I thought.

802
00:55:02,980 --> 00:55:04,800
See, now that could be what a jury member is going to say.

803
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:06,380
Isn't that interesting that I just said that?

804
00:55:06,380 --> 00:55:08,260
Yes, it was riveting. Thank you.

805
00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:22,260
Well, I think, sometimes I think folks that are hardcore fans of either In the Groove or DDR, you know, and have too much of a one-track mind where they only see the stuff they want to see in the games.

806
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:32,260
They don't kind of think that, oh, if this really does go to court, an unbiased jury is going to take a look at it and, you know, have their say.

807
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:35,400
Alright, enough lawsuit chat, I'm done.

808
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:41,940
Um, blah, blah, blah, blah, let's see. I'm reading chat room. www.orangelaunasradio.com, click on chat.

809
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:45,780
Oh, this is cute. Um, Sakurino has a question from Eclatov.

810
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:50,020
Um, are you able to hook him up with Noria?

811
00:55:50,020 --> 00:55:53,020
I don't know, I don't know why somebody would want that, but...

812
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:56,020
No.

813
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:59,540
Do you know Noria? Are you on a first-name basis?

814
00:55:59,540 --> 00:56:04,540
Like Sana and Togo and all them, they just walk around the office all day, right?

815
00:56:04,540 --> 00:56:07,540
Maybe in Japan.

816
00:56:07,540 --> 00:56:12,540
I mean, we occasionally get people in our office. I don't ever remember seeing Noria.

817
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:16,540
And if I did, she'd probably come at me all crazy.

818
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:20,540
You have to understand that Naoki keeps a close eye on his harem, okay?

819
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:25,540
They don't leave Japan.

820
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:29,940
In fact, I remember the year that Akira Yomoka came to E3, and you were just as excited as I was.

821
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:32,940
And I stalked him!

822
00:56:32,940 --> 00:56:34,940
And three pictures!

823
00:56:34,940 --> 00:56:36,940
That's great.

824
00:56:36,940 --> 00:56:38,940
Anyway.

825
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:41,940
Um, let's do this. Let's go ahead and, um...

826
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:44,940
Actually, let's move to the Pump It Up topic, since we were kind of getting into that a little bit,

827
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:46,940
and then we'll open up the Skype line after another break.

828
00:56:46,940 --> 00:56:48,940
Um, Pump It Up...

829
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:50,940
Um, now...

830
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:52,940
We, actually, this game's not gonna be out.

831
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:56,940
Now, what's the official name of the game here we're looking at for Pump It Up Exceed Home?

832
00:56:56,940 --> 00:56:57,940
Pump It Up Exceed.

833
00:56:57,940 --> 00:57:00,940
Pump It Up Exceed. The home release is coming out the 31st.

834
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:04,940
We got a copy though, or I should say, Miklotov got a copy.

835
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:07,940
Now, don't forget to turn on your mic.

836
00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:09,940
Heck yeah, I got a copy.

837
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:11,940
How did you get a copy?

838
00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:13,940
Okay, it's a great story.

839
00:57:13,940 --> 00:57:14,940
Was it through Source's economy?

840
00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:15,940
No, no, no.

841
00:57:15,940 --> 00:57:18,940
Secret and Amuro agreements where they share games with each other?

842
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:26,940
After work one day, I was like, hey, I want both Pump It Ups for Xbox and PS2 when they come out, because I know they're different.

843
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:32,940
I better go to EB and pre-order them. So I went in there and I pre-ordered it, and the guy was like, hey, we got one traded in today.

844
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:36,940
Even though it's not out, do you want it? I was like, heck yeah, I want it. So I bought it.

845
00:57:36,940 --> 00:57:44,940
How does someone trade something in that's not out yet? They don't even question it. Is that DDR Stream 3? Okay.

846
00:57:44,940 --> 00:57:51,940
They were like, yeah, it doesn't come with the pad, and we're still charging you the price as if it were coming with the pad, but do you want it?

847
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:54,940
And I was like, hmm, I'll have it a month early. Yeah, I'll take it.

848
00:57:54,940 --> 00:58:00,940
So I'm just gonna trade it in when it actually comes out, but yeah, I've had the game since about the beginning of August.

849
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:02,940
That's the Xbox version?

850
00:58:02,940 --> 00:58:04,940
I have the PS2 one. Um, I want-

851
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:06,940
You do, do ya?

852
00:58:06,940 --> 00:58:08,940
Yeah, I do have the PS2 one. Huh.

853
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:10,940
We'll have to talk later.

854
00:58:10,940 --> 00:58:16,940
But, yeah, um... God, that game's a punk.

855
00:58:16,940 --> 00:58:25,940
Okay, so tell us about what... Now, you are more familiar, and this is hilarious because you're the one that works for Konami, but you're more familiar with the arcade version than probably any of us.

856
00:58:25,940 --> 00:58:29,940
So, um, tell us about the differences between the home version and the arcade.

857
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:33,940
Well, okay, Exceed Arcade has a whole bunch of songs.

858
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:36,940
We actually got a pretty decent song list for America.

859
00:58:36,940 --> 00:58:39,940
We have, on the PS2 one, 101 songs.

860
00:58:39,940 --> 00:58:43,940
The Xbox one has 97. I don't know why.

861
00:58:43,940 --> 00:58:49,940
But we lost a couple pop songs for America,

862
00:58:49,940 --> 00:58:55,940
and we also gained some of the revival songs from Exceed 2, which is random.

863
00:58:55,940 --> 00:59:05,440
They censored a couple of the Spanish songs, which makes no sense to me, and that's about the only differences.

864
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:08,440
Okay, so tell us about, like, the unlock. How do you unlock songs in the games?

865
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:17,440
I have no clue. I've been playing that game since the beginning of August. I've unlocked four songs now, or, okay, three, and then Justin unlocked one today.

866
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:22,600
And, I mean, if you think about it, there are four modes.

867
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:30,080
And to play songs in certain modes, like, say, I want to play, uh, what's the song?

868
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:33,560
I want to play Chicken Wing in survival mode.

869
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:34,560
Okay.

870
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:35,560
Okay.

871
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:38,720
Well, it's not unlocked in survival mode, so I have to play it in home mode just to

872
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:40,240
unlock it.

873
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:45,180
And so I had to go through the game pretty much and play every song in every mode just

874
00:59:45,180 --> 00:59:49,740
to make sure that every song appeared in every mode, and I don't even have that still! So

875
00:59:49,740 --> 00:59:56,140
I've pretty much played over 400 songs, and I've only unlocked 4 songs. But, along the

876
00:59:56,140 --> 01:00:03,140
way, you also unlock modifiers. So, I mean, I've not been totally bored out of my mind

877
01:00:03,140 --> 01:00:10,140
playing the same songs over and over again. I get random cool modifiers that are weird.

878
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:15,100
I like the one that was coming from the corner. Yeah, Exceed modifier. It's very hard to read

879
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:20,340
There's also one where it comes from the bottom middle and just kind of throws it all the way up and then to the side

880
01:00:21,020 --> 01:00:23,340
it also has something like break and something like

881
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:28,940
Wave it has random velocity. You can change the arrow skins

882
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:37,180
But yeah, it's it's a pretty mean game to try to unlock songs. There's also boobs and ass video

883
01:00:37,180 --> 01:00:43,300
Yeah, I mean this thought I'd put that in there right there. This game got a t-rating and you know, it's censored

884
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:51,020
two Spanish words, but there's a lot of breasts. Lots and lots of breasts. I don't understand

885
01:00:51,020 --> 01:00:52,020
it.

886
01:00:52,020 --> 01:00:53,020
Like, not bare breasts.

887
01:00:53,020 --> 01:00:58,220
No, but I mean, they smack her in the chin when she moves. The whole video is about her

888
01:00:58,220 --> 01:00:59,220
breasts.

889
01:00:59,220 --> 01:01:03,180
There's a lot of videos that look like internet Flash videos out there, but...

890
01:01:03,180 --> 01:01:04,180
They're really funny.

891
01:01:04,180 --> 01:01:06,980
Well, you know what, though? I thought one thing that really impressed me, really, really

892
01:01:06,980 --> 01:01:12,540
impressed me about Pump It Up Exceed on PlayStation 2 was the fact that every song had a unique

893
01:01:12,540 --> 01:01:18,020
video it wasn't some type of loop video like all these like little clips kind of

894
01:01:18,020 --> 01:01:21,120
looped over and over again it was like each one even though the video quality

895
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:25,440
may be a little question mark some of them look like flash animation so one

896
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:30,980
love is just absolutely beautiful it's really nice CG it looks and then rate on

897
01:01:30,980 --> 01:01:36,380
the TV rappers that leaves alive then yeah it started off as an anime and then

898
01:01:36,380 --> 01:01:41,900
it kind of looked like Parappa and then it went to Mega Man and yeah it's very

899
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:44,020
Very odd.

900
01:01:44,020 --> 01:01:49,360
And some of the actual music videos for actual songs are like Little Less Conversation, Name

901
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:53,620
of the Game, and Walkie Talkie Man, which is the stupidest song ever on Crazy.

902
01:01:53,620 --> 01:01:54,740
It's a 17.

903
01:01:54,740 --> 01:01:58,980
Tell us about where In the Groove might have gotten some of its inspiration from Pump It

904
01:01:58,980 --> 01:01:59,980
Up.

905
01:01:59,980 --> 01:02:00,980
What?

906
01:02:00,980 --> 01:02:03,220
Like, the really hard songs.

907
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:04,220
Get it?

908
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:05,220
Oh.

909
01:02:05,220 --> 01:02:06,220
Okay.

910
01:02:06,220 --> 01:02:07,220
I was drawing on my foot.

911
01:02:07,220 --> 01:02:08,220
I'm sorry.

912
01:02:08,220 --> 01:02:09,220
It's alright.

913
01:02:09,220 --> 01:02:10,260
Hope you're having fun.

914
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:18,320
I was. Yeah, it's got some really crappy steps for crazy, but if you get the Xbox one, there's

915
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:23,340
actually, on Xbox Live for free, you can download a step editor, which is not in the PS2 one,

916
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:24,340
which is really awesome.

917
01:02:24,340 --> 01:02:29,460
It's kind of weird that you can download a step editor on Xbox Live. I don't know, it's

918
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:30,460
kind of weird.

919
01:02:30,460 --> 01:02:35,380
Yeah, but I'll be happy, because I can finally make steps to like, songs that only have one

920
01:02:35,380 --> 01:02:39,480
set of steps, and that's not even one set of steps for freestyle and normal, it's just

921
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:43,780
It's like they only have normal steps, and that's it, and they're like a two.

922
01:02:43,780 --> 01:02:47,840
So it's actually, the Xbox One is probably going to be the best one with song packs and

923
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:51,080
that downloadable step editor.

924
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:54,520
Song packs on the Xbox One are going to be a little more expensive though, right?

925
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:58,460
Yeah, I don't think it's actually been officially announced, but they were tossing around the

926
01:02:58,460 --> 01:03:01,920
idea of seven dollars for three songs.

927
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:07,660
However, it would include licenses, so I mean, it's not like you're going to get, hopefully,

928
01:03:07,660 --> 01:03:10,380
It's not like you're going to get just Banya songs.

929
01:03:10,380 --> 01:03:15,340
You'll also get, like, I Hope to Goodness, Lazanka, or Fairy Boat, or Black Cat, or all

930
01:03:15,340 --> 01:03:19,780
those really cool songs from the really old games that don't show up anymore.

931
01:03:19,780 --> 01:03:22,660
I was pissed off that Run to You was not in the song list.

932
01:03:22,660 --> 01:03:25,060
Although, the game does have a very impressive song list.

933
01:03:25,060 --> 01:03:26,780
Yeah, it's really amazing.

934
01:03:26,780 --> 01:03:28,180
I couldn't believe it.

935
01:03:28,180 --> 01:03:34,420
All right, so I'll sum up the PlayStation version of Pump It Up Exceed, the good stuff

936
01:03:34,420 --> 01:03:35,860
and the bad stuff, and do you recommend it?

937
01:03:35,860 --> 01:03:41,100
The good stuff is that it's Pump It Up and it's the superior dancing game.

938
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:46,700
The bad stuff is that Mad Cats makes the pad.

939
01:03:46,700 --> 01:03:52,860
And that some of the steps are just utter crap because there's no reason Walkie Talkie

940
01:03:52,860 --> 01:03:58,660
Man should go to every last little noise in the whole song.

941
01:03:58,660 --> 01:03:59,980
The end.

942
01:03:59,980 --> 01:04:05,060
I would say I think that the game is pretty good looking.

943
01:04:05,060 --> 01:04:10,020
I think it's got a huge song list, I love the fact that there's a unique video for every

944
01:04:10,020 --> 01:04:12,500
song, I think it's just kind of a fun game.

945
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:17,580
I think some of the songs are kind of a little, especially some of the Banya songs are a little

946
01:04:17,580 --> 01:04:18,580
average.

947
01:04:18,580 --> 01:04:23,380
Yeah, Banya is very hit or miss, at least in my eyes.

948
01:04:23,380 --> 01:04:24,780
But the K-pop stuff is pretty rad.

949
01:04:24,780 --> 01:04:28,740
Oh, the K-pop stuff is great, and so is the pop, because it's a lot of Latin songs.

950
01:04:28,740 --> 01:04:31,420
And the regular pop stuff is cool.

951
01:04:31,420 --> 01:04:34,460
So I was very surprised by Pump It Up Home Version.

952
01:04:34,460 --> 01:04:38,600
I've gone from probably just not really interested in picking it up to.

953
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:41,000
I definitely want to pick this game up.

954
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,160
I think it's going to be really good.

955
01:04:43,160 --> 01:04:49,120
However, the bad things about the game, the interface still annoys the shit out of me.

956
01:04:49,120 --> 01:04:54,120
I hate Pump's interface with a passion, and it is no better in XSEDE.

957
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:59,880
The thing is, it's based off the arcade one, and the arcade one has no, like, left and

958
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:01,080
right buttons.

959
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:02,080
So you have...

960
01:05:02,080 --> 01:05:03,080
It still sucks.

961
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:04,080
They could have done something else.

962
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:08,080
the way you put in codes, it sucks.

963
01:05:08,080 --> 01:05:12,080
Well that's why you can play in home mode and then you can hold the triangle button down and just get out of your home.

964
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:16,080
I don't want to play in home mode, I want easy modifiers in arcade mode.

965
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:20,080
This always pisses me off. Anyway, it's not just that, I just don't like the

966
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:24,080
huge wheel that takes forever to get around and just, I don't know.

967
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:28,080
That's just me. It is.

968
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:32,080
Justin, what do you think, because I know you're a long time DDR fan, what do you think of

969
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:36,080
on PlayStation. I was very much like you when I first heard

970
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:41,800
about it. I was like, oh, let's pump it up. I've seen that so many times at MGL and Sviggle,

971
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:46,080
the local arcades, and I just do not care. Sviggle doesn't have it anymore. MGL took

972
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:47,320
it. Oh, well.

973
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:59,000
Okay, sorry. That's my local arcade. Anyways, but after playing it on Shane's Copy,

974
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:09,000
I found it was, like, amazingly fun. I love the fact that the videos are all fun and not just looped animations, and they all have a sense of humor to them for the most part.

975
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:16,000
I love the songs. I've always loved K-pop, and the fact that Caution is on this game is so amazing.

976
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,000
And Starion, yes.

977
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,000
And Starion, oh my god.

978
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
We're gonna have to play Korean music later.

979
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,000
Yes, we will.

980
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:24,000
Even though I don't have a whole lot of pump music.

981
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:28,000
I know, you need to bring me this pumpsy roar. Anyway.

982
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:34,120
But yeah, I think I'm definitely going to pick up the Xbox version, because I like the

983
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:40,880
Xbox better than the PS2, sadly, so I will definitely pick that up, and yeah, it looks

984
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:43,120
like a great game.

985
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:48,600
Xtavor, what little you saw of the game, what do you think of Pump It Up?

986
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:51,240
You know, I saw it as much as you did, I think.

987
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:52,240
Oh, I guess that's true.

988
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:54,720
I thought you left the room for some reason.

989
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:55,720
Okay.

990
01:06:55,720 --> 01:07:01,080
It seems like a game that I'll watch you play occasionally, you know?

991
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:06,920
I won't play it, because I, you know, really suck at those games, and it just looks really,

992
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:11,320
I don't know, hard to play.

993
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:12,320
The end.

994
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:13,320
Okay.

995
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:16,920
Loki, I know you really didn't get to see it for very long, but what did you think from

996
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:17,920
what little you saw?

997
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:19,880
It looked like Pump It Up.

998
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:22,000
The crazy steps I still think are ridiculous.

999
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,000
I do too.

1000
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:27,000
Like, it was ridiculous in the arcade, and on a homepad it's...

1001
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,000
Why?

1002
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,000
Stop.

1003
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,000
Please.

1004
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
Sir, on a Mad Catz homepad of all things.

1005
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Oh god, no.

1006
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
That would never work.

1007
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Good luck.

1008
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:39,880
Actually, as much as I hate Mad Catz, and as much as everybody hates Mad Catz, they

1009
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:45,080
have been using those at the Pump Qualifiers for the World Pump Tournament, and apparently

1010
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:46,800
they are pretty good.

1011
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:50,000
Like, they can aid Dignity, which is a really, really hard song.

1012
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:53,120
I call bullshit until I play on one myself.

1013
01:07:53,120 --> 01:07:54,480
We'll see though.

1014
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:57,520
Fine, whatever.

1015
01:07:57,520 --> 01:07:58,920
Alright.

1016
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:02,800
Okay, we're gonna go to a break you guys, and when we come back, we're gonna take your calls on the

1017
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:06,640
Skype line. We'll also talk a little bit about the tiny news we had in the, um...

1018
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:07,560
well actually it was

1019
01:08:07,560 --> 01:08:11,400
kind of major, but I think most of you guys have read about this by now, the Xtreme 2

1020
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:13,440
song list, as well as

1021
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:14,480
Karaoke

1022
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:18,240
Revolution. Some song lists showed up for that as well.

1023
01:08:18,240 --> 01:08:25,240
So we're going to talk about all that when we come back from this break, and taking your calls on the Skype line, www.orangeloungeradio.com, click on interact with us.

1024
01:08:25,240 --> 01:08:31,240
And in this break, I'm going to start off with a song that was kind of inspired by the chat room, because I think I'm ignoring them, but I'm not.

1025
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:34,240
So this one's for the chat room, even those people that were complaining about it.

1026
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:39,240
In fact, we're going to make this an entire break of 2DX songs, so we'll be back after this.

1027
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:09,240
And the sun is giving you the sight of the green bridge

1028
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:13,240
I keep on running close to you, baby

1029
01:09:13,240 --> 01:09:16,240
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes

1030
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:20,240
Cause you're blind, I have been through

1031
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:24,240
Wonderful times of forgetting completely

1032
01:09:24,240 --> 01:09:28,240
I'm too tall, let's lay together

1033
01:09:28,240 --> 01:09:31,240
I'm too tall, and it's my fault

1034
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:41,240
I'm too strong, let's bring it together I'm too strong, let me go see me

1035
01:09:41,240 --> 01:09:44,240
It's very very sweet

1036
01:11:14,240 --> 01:11:17,840
Check it out, come check it out

1037
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:21,040
Catch me, catch you down

1038
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:24,040
Baby, come check it out

1039
01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:25,640
Put me, come check it out

1040
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:30,240
Catch me, catch you down

1041
01:11:31,240 --> 01:11:34,240
You are, you are, don't get it

1042
01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:37,240
You are, you are, you're too much

1043
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:40,240
You're the only one who can love you

1044
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:57,240
I'm digging through the midst of love to find my way

1045
01:13:57,240 --> 01:14:07,240
My heart belongs, I'm digging through the midst of love

1046
01:14:07,240 --> 01:14:16,240
To fight the pain my heart belongs to

1047
01:16:07,240 --> 01:16:25,040
Orange Lounge Radio, Maimani Music, and more.

1048
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:29,640
Orange Lounge Radio back at you here in that break you heard a little bit of Sylvia Drive,

1049
01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:37,160
9th Style, Injection of Love, Red, Inazuma, Happy Sky, Everyday Lovely Day, 8th Consumer.

1050
01:16:37,160 --> 01:16:40,160
It's going to be a booing Everyday Lovely Day 4, Miggletov.

1051
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:43,160
It's not a crappy song. You're a crappy song.

1052
01:16:43,160 --> 01:16:45,160
All right.

1053
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:51,160
We're going to open up the old Skyplines right now and take your calls here on our program.

1054
01:16:51,160 --> 01:16:56,160
If you'd like to call us, www.orangelauncherradio.com and click on interact with us.

1055
01:16:56,160 --> 01:17:01,160
Miggletov, I did get a question from somebody who is not able to call us on the Skypline.

1056
01:17:01,160 --> 01:17:02,160
Well, then they're losers.

1057
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:04,160
But had a question. It's Rini.

1058
01:17:04,160 --> 01:17:06,160
Well, I might not answer it then.

1059
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:27,160
So he had a question that I need to ask you. Alright. Basically what he wants to know, is Konami doing anything for the fan requests on DDR Freak for new stuff? Like new mods, new features in DDR, maybe songs. When he says new mods, he's saying things like, you know, wave, those types of things.

1060
01:17:27,160 --> 01:17:31,160
Has there been an official request for fan requests?

1061
01:17:31,160 --> 01:17:35,160
So, in other words, has there been something on DDR Freak asking you to say things?

1062
01:17:35,160 --> 01:17:36,160
Yeah.

1063
01:17:36,160 --> 01:17:38,160
I don't believe I've seen one in a little while.

1064
01:17:38,160 --> 01:17:43,160
Well, then, they're just requesting stuff that's not being heard.

1065
01:17:43,160 --> 01:17:45,160
Alright, alright, I gotcha.

1066
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:46,160
Bye, John!

1067
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:47,160
Alright.

1068
01:17:47,160 --> 01:17:48,160
Anyway...

1069
01:17:48,160 --> 01:17:49,160
Oh, goodie!

1070
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:52,160
The gay-straight ratio has gotten worse!

1071
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:57,160
My friend John just showed up, so he's here now to further surround Loki.

1072
01:17:57,160 --> 01:17:59,160
We won't make you gay by end of show.

1073
01:17:59,160 --> 01:18:00,160
No, I'm kidding.

1074
01:18:00,160 --> 01:18:03,440
I honestly don't know.

1075
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:09,700
Usually when Konami wants to listen, or really cares to listen, you'll see like a huge thread

1076
01:18:09,700 --> 01:18:16,880
devoted to, oh, Konami's asking us to, you know, say, put this song in, so please list

1077
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:18,480
your songs you want in.

1078
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:23,840
Do people, now, you don't have power over what goes in the game.

1079
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:24,840
No.

1080
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:25,840
So...

1081
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:28,420
Well, I had the power, no, no, I didn't even have the power, but I had a really vocal voice

1082
01:18:28,420 --> 01:18:32,300
about something that maybe in a few years I can talk about.

1083
01:18:32,300 --> 01:18:36,040
Okay, but you can't talk about it now. I can't talk about it now.

1084
01:18:36,040 --> 01:18:42,180
Do people that have the power to change what's in the game, do they read DDR Freak and those

1085
01:18:42,180 --> 01:18:45,100
types of things? I don't know who would actually have the power

1086
01:18:45,100 --> 01:18:48,420
to change the game. Yes, they do. So keep making those pointless

1087
01:18:48,420 --> 01:18:53,360
threads! Alright.

1088
01:18:53,360 --> 01:19:00,080
love it when you make a please put in sakura or please put in... what's another crappy

1089
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:12,000
song? A crappy song! Butterfly! Oh! Cartoon Heroes! Alright. So keep making those pointless

1090
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:17,480
threads on DDRFreak with your requests and maybe somebody from Konami will give a crap.

1091
01:19:17,480 --> 01:19:23,280
we'll see. Yeah, when we laugh at it. You know what's going to happen? When the head

1092
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:26,900
of PR or whatever is coming out to our company to speak about their games and stuff, I'm

1093
01:19:26,900 --> 01:19:31,880
just going to say, keep playing Sakurai the next one, or you know, just do... I have a

1094
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:38,280
controversial question for you. I'm playing Meteos, what is it? Do people at the office

1095
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:45,280
make fun of DDR Freak Post? I have openly admitted I do. Everybody knows I'm the jerk,

1096
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:51,280
So, I mean, how last year? Remember the extreme thread? That was a big joke. It was fun.

1097
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:59,280
You know what you need? You need a giant plotter printer so you can print the thread, or whatever the post is, super big on the wall, so that you can laugh at it.

1098
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:06,280
You know, you can just have, like, wallpaper on the wall with really bad posts from DDR3. Ooh, I'm gonna do that in my game room if I ever get one.

1099
01:20:06,280 --> 01:20:09,280
How come you guys didn't do clues this year?

1100
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:11,280
I can't really say.

1101
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:14,880
Okay, that's that. That's all Gamepro's fault.

1102
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:18,640
All Gamepro. I got served. Yeah, that's all Gamepro's fault. Let's go to a call.

1103
01:20:18,640 --> 01:20:23,040
Hello, you are on Orange Launch Radio.

1104
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:26,280
Hello, my friend. What's on your mind?

1105
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:29,560
Well, let me see. Just, you know, going through the usual on a Sunday,

1106
01:20:29,560 --> 01:20:34,380
me heading out to Long Island to play 2DX and breaking another in the

1107
01:20:34,380 --> 01:20:35,520
group machine in the city.

1108
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:39,480
Oh, that reminds me. I have news for you because you were wanting me to come to

1109
01:20:39,480 --> 01:20:42,320
the Digital Life Expo, and you're actually not the only person on the East Coast who

1110
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:47,580
wanted me to come out there. I'm having a meeting with my boss next week to negotiate

1111
01:20:47,580 --> 01:20:51,360
trying to get the time off to make that happen. I already have a place to stay if I come out

1112
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:55,660
there, so the plan is being set in motion. I was serious last week. I'm going to try

1113
01:20:55,660 --> 01:20:59,400
and make it happen, so we'll see. It all depends on it.

1114
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:03,260
If anything, if you're still having problems with, like, you know, finding a place to stay

1115
01:21:03,260 --> 01:21:09,300
day for other people, there's this cat named, you know, Sketch on the New York forms. He's

1116
01:21:09,300 --> 01:21:14,100
usually very, he usually offers, you know, his apartment for people who are actually

1117
01:21:14,100 --> 01:21:20,340
going to be in the tournament. So, don't take my word, I mean, don't say I, you know, don't

1118
01:21:20,340 --> 01:21:24,140
say I was, you know, I was, wait a minute, don't say I sent you, but, you know, you want

1119
01:21:24,140 --> 01:21:29,500
me to stay at the house of a complete internet stranger. No, but I've already met him. What

1120
01:21:29,500 --> 01:21:33,500
What if he rapes me or something? That would be, you would feel bad.

1121
01:21:33,500 --> 01:21:35,500
You wouldn't feel anything.

1122
01:21:35,500 --> 01:21:37,500
But he's very generous.

1123
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:40,500
I'm teasing, I'm sure this guy's great.

1124
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:42,500
It would just be like you sitting down.

1125
01:21:42,500 --> 01:21:46,500
Shut the hell up.

1126
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:47,500
All right.

1127
01:21:47,500 --> 01:21:51,500
Can you speak for us about, you know, any more Konami stuff that you might know?

1128
01:21:51,500 --> 01:21:54,500
That's unclassified.

1129
01:21:54,500 --> 01:21:58,580
classified konami stuff that you might know miklata

1130
01:21:58,580 --> 01:21:59,720
uh... unclear

1131
01:21:59,720 --> 01:22:03,540
but now many of us for one god damn minute jesus i'd like to do a little

1132
01:22:03,540 --> 01:22:04,820
further

1133
01:22:04,820 --> 01:22:09,640
any unclassified konami stuff that you can speak up and classified

1134
01:22:09,640 --> 01:22:12,460
uh... you know things that will get you fired for your nd a

1135
01:22:12,460 --> 01:22:12,980
there's this

1136
01:22:12,980 --> 01:22:15,980
well i i i think lunch at like uh...

1137
01:22:15,980 --> 01:22:17,560
between one and three

1138
01:22:17,560 --> 01:22:19,780
so that's not going to be fired

1139
01:22:19,780 --> 01:22:22,140
besides you

1140
01:22:22,140 --> 01:22:23,580
well what was that

1141
01:22:23,580 --> 01:22:25,620
Who else is making steps besides you?

1142
01:22:25,620 --> 01:22:27,820
Sorry, you gotta excuse the retainer.

1143
01:22:27,820 --> 01:22:31,100
Can you say that? Who else is making steps on the staff besides you?

1144
01:22:31,100 --> 01:22:32,760
I won't name names,

1145
01:22:32,760 --> 01:22:39,220
but if you look at the instruction booklet for UltraMix 2,

1146
01:22:39,220 --> 01:22:41,880
the names pretty much haven't changed.

1147
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:44,980
Oh, so the same people who did the steps for the last one?

1148
01:22:44,980 --> 01:22:46,540
Well, now he didn't say that exactly.

1149
01:22:46,540 --> 01:22:47,540
I answered that?

1150
01:22:47,540 --> 01:22:48,780
Or we could just assume.

1151
01:22:48,780 --> 01:22:52,140
Well, you have to infer from his clues, young man.

1152
01:22:52,140 --> 01:22:57,140
Okay. Ooh, I gave a clue. I'm gonna get in trouble. Yes, you are.

1153
01:22:57,140 --> 01:23:01,140
Another question. Extreme 2, are the steps going to be horrible?

1154
01:23:01,140 --> 01:23:04,140
Just give us a kiss.

1155
01:23:04,140 --> 01:23:08,140
Well, are the steps going to be horrible in Extreme 2?

1156
01:23:08,140 --> 01:23:10,140
Extreme 2 is really fun, I have to say.

1157
01:23:10,140 --> 01:23:16,140
With the exception of the licenses, I mean, with the exception of the songs, you know, the other Konami songs have been there, the licenses.

1158
01:23:16,140 --> 01:23:17,140
Like the new stuff.

1159
01:23:17,140 --> 01:23:18,140
Are they just going to bomb?

1160
01:23:18,140 --> 01:23:19,140
The new shit.

1161
01:23:19,140 --> 01:23:21,140
No, they're fun. They're really, really fun.

1162
01:23:21,140 --> 01:23:26,140
I just hope they're challenging, too, because I don't want to be forced to make an edit.

1163
01:23:26,140 --> 01:23:29,140
Well, have a little face.

1164
01:23:29,140 --> 01:23:36,140
Well, nobody's forcing you. You could go play in the groove, and then you could use your hands and your feet and your butt and your head and your neighbor.

1165
01:23:36,140 --> 01:23:38,140
Now, now, now, if you want some additional...

1166
01:23:38,140 --> 01:23:40,140
Just so you can hit all the arrows.

1167
01:23:40,140 --> 01:23:43,140
Wait for the game to come out, Taco, then you can start the shit talking.

1168
01:23:43,140 --> 01:23:46,140
If you want some hard stuff, you've got to play the itoys stuff.

1169
01:23:46,140 --> 01:23:49,140
Hands and feet mode is where it's friggin' annoying.

1170
01:23:49,140 --> 01:23:56,140
I've done enough. I think I've injured my hand just playing in the groove trying to do the holds.

1171
01:23:56,140 --> 01:23:59,140
I got a little bruised.

1172
01:23:59,140 --> 01:24:04,140
I think I understand what you're getting at, Zaku, because this is kind of the feeling I'm reading on DDR Freak.

1173
01:24:04,140 --> 01:24:11,140
This is the general vibe I get on the DDR Freak threads, is that DDR Extreme was a wee bit of a letdown for some fans.

1174
01:24:11,140 --> 01:24:13,140
It was just crap. That's it.

1175
01:24:13,140 --> 01:24:15,140
No. Extreme was good.

1176
01:24:15,140 --> 01:24:17,140
Most of the sexual licenses were crap.

1177
01:24:17,140 --> 01:24:21,140
Hold on, Zaku, don't interrupt me. Alright, don't interrupt me.

1178
01:24:21,140 --> 01:24:26,140
Does Extreme 2 make up for the things that tick people off about Extreme 1?

1179
01:24:26,140 --> 01:24:29,140
First of all, I think those people are whiners.

1180
01:24:29,140 --> 01:24:33,140
There's no reason that I thought they were decent steps.

1181
01:24:33,140 --> 01:24:34,140
Wait a minute, though.

1182
01:24:34,140 --> 01:24:37,140
Zaku cannot be held back on Extreme.

1183
01:24:37,140 --> 01:24:41,140
Zaku, I will hang up on you.

1184
01:24:41,140 --> 01:24:43,140
Hold on, I'll get back to you in a minute.

1185
01:24:43,140 --> 01:24:46,140
Which was the better game last year, Ultra Mix 2 or Extreme?

1186
01:24:46,140 --> 01:24:48,140
Ultra Mix 2, everybody knows that.

1187
01:24:48,140 --> 01:24:49,140
Okay, well then there you go.

1188
01:24:49,140 --> 01:24:55,140
I'm just defending Extreme, because people belittle it because it wasn't the Japanese one.

1189
01:24:55,140 --> 01:24:58,140
Oh my god, the steps are too easy because they're not 12s.

1190
01:24:58,140 --> 01:25:03,140
I think people were a little harsh on Extreme, but it did have its issues.

1191
01:25:03,140 --> 01:25:04,140
Yeah, I know, I know.

1192
01:25:04,140 --> 01:25:05,140
I mean, it had...

1193
01:25:05,140 --> 01:25:06,140
It was like Maximizer.

1194
01:25:06,140 --> 01:25:08,140
Maximizer was cool.

1195
01:25:08,140 --> 01:25:10,140
Interface, we all know that that's better now.

1196
01:25:10,140 --> 01:25:12,140
I liked Last Year's but whatever.

1197
01:25:12,140 --> 01:25:16,860
It's a song list. We've seen more transplants from Extreme, like, you know,

1198
01:25:16,860 --> 01:25:20,500
Irasitha Baman, Lago Badevita, all those Extreme songs you wanted are

1199
01:25:20,500 --> 01:25:23,700
in Extreme 2, it seems. Cartoon Heroes, hello.

1200
01:25:23,700 --> 01:25:28,020
The fact that they nailed, you know,

1201
01:25:28,020 --> 01:25:32,060
they nailed Silence was pretty much it. Your phone's ringing.

1202
01:25:32,060 --> 01:25:35,780
Yes, I know, so I'm going to wrap this up right now.

1203
01:25:35,780 --> 01:25:40,460
Bottom line is this, I just hope Extreme 2 is a lot better than Extreme 2.

1204
01:25:40,460 --> 01:25:47,460
It is. Duly noted. Duly noted. I gotta get this called. Alright. Take care, Cool Cat.

1205
01:25:48,860 --> 01:25:50,340
Alright.

1206
01:25:50,340 --> 01:25:52,620
Go get that phone. Don't be rude.

1207
01:25:52,620 --> 01:25:58,500
Alright. I'm trying to read what's going on in the chair room here.

1208
01:25:58,500 --> 01:26:00,020
Umm...

1209
01:26:00,020 --> 01:26:02,020
Are the steps still gonna suck

1210
01:26:02,020 --> 01:26:04,140
because you're working on them?

1211
01:26:04,140 --> 01:26:08,540
Oh, burn, yeah.

1212
01:26:08,540 --> 01:26:13,540
I have stuff I wasn't proud of too, and I have stuff I'm not proud of and other things.

1213
01:26:13,540 --> 01:26:17,540
As long as Konami of Hawaii can learn how to cut songs, you know?

1214
01:26:17,540 --> 01:26:21,540
Actually be able to edit them like, I don't know, Skulk, for example?

1215
01:26:21,540 --> 01:26:27,540
You know, as much as I thought I hated the edit for Skulk, I don't mind it anymore because

1216
01:26:27,540 --> 01:26:31,540
there's... I don't think I'd want to be dancing to, or...

1217
01:26:31,540 --> 01:26:36,660
dancing, stepping on arrows to the part where he sings a lot just because I

1218
01:26:36,660 --> 01:26:40,180
don't think it would be that fun. Granted, it was the same thing over and over again for the first episode.

1219
01:26:40,180 --> 01:26:45,820
I liked the cut of Skulk, so you shut up. Um, alright. Um, damn, now I forgot the

1220
01:26:45,820 --> 01:26:48,220
question I was gonna ask. I don't know what it was either. Was it

1221
01:26:48,220 --> 01:26:52,620
Meteos-related? Because that's what I'm doing. No, it's not Meteos-related. It's back on extreme.

1222
01:26:52,620 --> 01:26:56,680
I'm sorry to make you talk about work. At least I'm not asking you about, you know

1223
01:26:56,680 --> 01:27:06,680
I don't know what. What was I going to say about Extreme? Oh, I don't know if you can answer this, so, you know, feel free to tell me you can't if you can't.

1224
01:27:06,680 --> 01:27:19,680
But, we all know one of the reasons why people loved UltraMix 2 is because DDR fans, like yourself, and other DDR fans who now work for Konami were responsible for the steps.

1225
01:27:19,680 --> 01:27:31,680
Extreme USA didn't have that. Does Extreme 2, now we all are assuming UltraMix 3 has it because you all worked on UltraMix before, does Extreme 2 now have the influence of those same DDR fans?

1226
01:27:31,680 --> 01:27:33,680
I really can't say.

1227
01:27:33,680 --> 01:27:35,680
I knew that. You just wanted to go back to media.

1228
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:45,680
So online stuff, are we gonna, you know, is online gonna be like pretty neat? Are they gonna do the same stuff they did with UltraMix 2 with Extreme 2?

1229
01:27:45,680 --> 01:27:49,680
I can't say. If it's not been the press release, I really can't say anything about that.

1230
01:27:49,680 --> 01:27:53,680
It has been in the press release. I just can't remember it.

1231
01:27:53,680 --> 01:27:56,680
Yeah, nice try. Don't get him fired.

1232
01:27:56,680 --> 01:27:59,680
They're already going to be pissed at him because he's been

1233
01:27:59,680 --> 01:28:01,680
whoring up Pump It Up on the server.

1234
01:28:01,680 --> 01:28:04,680
Heck yeah, that's all I do. They knew that when they hired me.

1235
01:28:04,680 --> 01:28:07,680
They knew I was the pump player.

1236
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:09,680
Well, we'll see. We'll check them out. You know what?

1237
01:28:09,680 --> 01:28:13,680
You know the best way to find out? Find a copy of the Extreme 2 manual

1238
01:28:13,680 --> 01:28:16,960
and see the credits and see if these guys' names are in them.

1239
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:20,560
And that would be one way to find out. So, we'll see.

1240
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:24,760
Anyway, I don't see any more calls coming in.

1241
01:28:24,760 --> 01:28:27,880
Actually, you know, you can also go to mobygames.com.

1242
01:28:27,880 --> 01:28:31,660
Credits for UltraMix 2 are listed there to see who worked on it.

1243
01:28:31,660 --> 01:28:34,840
If you don't actually have UltraMix 2, which if you don't, well,

1244
01:28:34,840 --> 01:28:39,120
you're stupid. Yeah, it was like five bucks at Walmart a couple weeks ago. I saw

1245
01:28:39,120 --> 01:28:40,520
some thread on DDR Free.

1246
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:42,520
I think that was a lie.

1247
01:28:42,520 --> 01:28:43,520
Was it?

1248
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:44,520
I think that person was just stupid.

1249
01:28:44,520 --> 01:28:45,520
Bastard.

1250
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:48,520
As are most people on DDR Freak.

1251
01:28:48,520 --> 01:28:49,520
Careful.

1252
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:50,520
Hey.

1253
01:28:50,520 --> 01:28:51,520
Hey.

1254
01:28:51,520 --> 01:28:52,520
Watch it.

1255
01:28:52,520 --> 01:28:53,520
We have our lovely-

1256
01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:54,520
I have friends who are at DDR Freak.

1257
01:28:54,520 --> 01:28:55,520
They know I love them.

1258
01:28:55,520 --> 01:28:56,520
Alright.

1259
01:28:56,520 --> 01:28:58,520
We have our lovely rewinds we do over on DDR Freak on Friday nights.

1260
01:28:58,520 --> 01:29:00,520
I forgot to pause Meteos.

1261
01:29:00,520 --> 01:29:01,520
I died.

1262
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:03,520
That's what you get.

1263
01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:04,520
I'm sad.

1264
01:29:04,520 --> 01:29:06,520
Don't tell me anything.

1265
01:29:06,520 --> 01:29:12,520
Seriously, this show is probably the most we've gotten out of Shane all year, and that's really not that much.

1266
01:29:12,520 --> 01:29:14,520
There really hasn't been that much.

1267
01:29:14,520 --> 01:29:16,520
We can get more out of him if he is drunk.

1268
01:29:16,520 --> 01:29:19,520
Yeah, I know. Anybody got some alcohol?

1269
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:21,520
John, you're here now. Go get him some alcohol.

1270
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:24,520
John's gonna go get him some alcohol.

1271
01:29:24,520 --> 01:29:28,520
I'm not drinking tonight. I have work tomorrow.

1272
01:29:28,520 --> 01:29:30,520
Alright. You'll be fine.

1273
01:29:30,520 --> 01:29:33,520
No, I will punch somebody in the face if I'm hungover.

1274
01:29:33,520 --> 01:29:35,520
Didn't you say you were immune to alcohol now?

1275
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:39,200
I say we test it. I say we don't.

1276
01:29:39,200 --> 01:29:42,640
I say we do.

1277
01:29:42,640 --> 01:29:46,240
Yeah, see, I might have to throw up a lot or something.

01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:49,360

You know, I think I have this CD.

1314
01:33:14,600 --> 01:33:15,600

01:34:00,600 --> 01:34:06,600
But don't stop listening to us, because we have the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match to take care of.

1322
01:34:06,600 --> 01:34:08,600
Does that sound like a plan?

1323
01:34:08,600 --> 01:34:10,600
Sounds like a plan!

1324
01:34:10,600 --> 01:34:16,600
Alright, and even Dark Sakura submitted a song to Cagematch tonight, even though she's not here yet.

1325
01:34:16,600 --> 01:34:27,600
Alright, the way the Orange Lounge Radio Cagematch works, we're gonna play three songs for you guys, one as chosen by each host of Orange Lounge Radio.

1326
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:39,600
And the winning song will go into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's Bomani Music and More program, featuring DDR and video game music all week long.

1327
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:43,600
So, Loki won the cage match last week, and Loki, what was the name of your song?

1328
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:57,600
It was Wipeout Pure. It wasn't Onyx with something. God, I can't remember what the name of the song was.

1329
01:34:57,600 --> 01:35:00,600
I'm still looking for it. I gotta find this here somewhere.

1330
01:35:00,600 --> 01:35:04,600
I just don't remember. It was a cool song though.

1331
01:35:04,600 --> 01:35:06,600
Well, I hope so.

1332
01:35:06,600 --> 01:35:10,600
Well, I don't remember the title. I just remember, hey, it's that song from Wipeout, you know?

1333
01:35:10,600 --> 01:35:12,040
uh...

1334
01:35:12,040 --> 01:35:15,800
but that's not because i can't find it but i think it began with an a

1335
01:35:15,800 --> 01:35:20,600
i can't remember uh... every drive by chance to play dole or fuck

1336
01:35:20,600 --> 01:35:21,320
or not

1337
01:35:21,320 --> 01:35:23,240
search by uh...

1338
01:35:23,240 --> 01:35:24,120
modified

1339
01:35:24,120 --> 01:35:26,480
they'll pull it up

1340
01:35:26,480 --> 01:35:29,240
to delay the night skate match for a little bit you know what we search for

1341
01:35:29,240 --> 01:35:32,800
the world but we can talk about the forty four hundred while you do that

1342
01:35:32,800 --> 01:35:36,280
because it's really good show this plug this show the really like that

1343
01:35:36,280 --> 01:35:37,560
the forty four hundred

1344
01:35:37,560 --> 01:35:44,120
is a show on USA. It's about people who were abducted, but it's all fake.

1345
01:35:44,120 --> 01:35:49,040
And it was all filmed in the daytime. It was all filmed in the daytime. And it's

1346
01:35:49,040 --> 01:35:57,160
just really good. And it's like X-Files meets X-Men, so it's really cool. And I love it,

1347
01:35:57,160 --> 01:36:01,280
and I'm crazy addicted to it. And you can go buy the first season on DVD

1348
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:04,740
for $20. Where at?

1349
01:36:04,740 --> 01:36:13,060
place that sells that DVD for $20. I got mine at Fry's but I saw it at Suncoast today. It's

1350
01:36:13,060 --> 01:36:20,500
still $20 and it's worth it. Not to make fun of, shut up John. It's a really good show.

1351
01:36:20,500 --> 01:36:25,060
Here it is. Alright, we finally found it. The name of the song is Onyx. It's by a band

1352
01:36:25,060 --> 01:36:30,480
called Cold Storage. Add it backwards. Alright. So here it is, a clip of last week's winner.

1353
01:36:30,480 --> 01:36:33,500
Song number one you can vote for tonight. Remember you gotta be in our chatroom if you

1354
01:36:33,500 --> 01:36:40,500
You want to vote? This is Cold Storage with Onyx.

1355
01:38:03,500 --> 01:38:26,100
All righty, that was song number one in tonight's cage match.

1356
01:38:26,100 --> 01:38:30,660
Last week's winner, after having to dig that one up, that was Cold Storage with Onyx.

1357
01:38:30,660 --> 01:38:32,500
Will it win for another week in a row?

1358
01:38:32,500 --> 01:38:37,540
will find out, but first we have to put it up against two brand new songs. So the second

1359
01:38:37,540 --> 01:38:41,940
song in tonight's cage match is going to be my pick. And you guys remember DJ Sammy, he

1360
01:38:41,940 --> 01:38:53,940
was really huge a couple years ago with that song Heaven, you know. And it was in DDR Max

1361
01:38:53,940 --> 01:38:57,740
2 and everything, so I know you guys know it. Well he has a brand new single out, brand

1362
01:38:57,740 --> 01:39:02,120
brand new single, and it's another cover. So guess what song he decided to take a spin

1363
01:39:02,120 --> 01:39:06,900
on this time. It's actually an old Annie Lennox song. It's his version of Why, and it's my

1364
01:39:06,900 --> 01:39:08,580
My pick for tonight's cage match, song number 2!

1365
01:39:36,900 --> 01:39:46,900
How many times do I have to try to tell you That I'm sorry for the things I've done?

1366
01:39:50,900 --> 01:39:55,900
But when I start to try to tell you That's when you have to tell me

1367
01:39:55,900 --> 01:40:00,900
Hey, this kind of trouble's only just begun

1368
01:40:00,900 --> 01:40:11,900
I've known myself too many times, why don't you ever learn to keep your face on the shelf?

1369
01:40:11,900 --> 01:40:15,900
That's why I have to bend to the other way

1370
01:40:15,900 --> 01:40:18,900
Because falling from your mouth

1371
01:40:18,900 --> 01:40:22,900
Falling from your mouth

1372
01:40:22,900 --> 01:40:25,900
Falling from your mouth

1373
01:40:25,900 --> 01:40:33,900
Tell me why

1374
01:40:33,900 --> 01:40:40,900
Why

1375
01:40:40,900 --> 01:40:45,900
I'm bending down, maybe blind, maybe viciously uncut

1376
01:40:45,900 --> 01:40:50,900
But I can still be what you're thinking

1377
01:40:50,900 --> 01:40:59,900
Ah, I've heard it said too many times, you've been better off

1378
01:40:59,900 --> 01:41:09,900
Why can't you see, it's just so mistaken, it's just so mistaken

1379
01:41:09,900 --> 01:41:16,900
Let's go down to the water bed, so we can catch the waves on the sky

1380
01:41:16,900 --> 01:41:19,320
Some things are better than some things

1381
01:41:19,320 --> 01:41:22,320
But they still turn me inside out

1382
01:41:23,620 --> 01:41:26,120
Turning inside out

1383
01:41:27,120 --> 01:41:29,620
Turning inside out

1384
01:41:29,620 --> 01:41:35,620
Tell me why

1385
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:43,920
Why

1386
01:41:43,920 --> 01:41:49,920
They'll be wild

1387
01:41:51,920 --> 01:41:56,920
Wild

1388
01:41:58,920 --> 01:42:00,920
This is the book I'll liberate

1389
01:42:00,920 --> 01:42:02,920
These are the words I'll never say

1390
01:42:02,920 --> 01:42:04,920
This is the path I'll never thread

1391
01:42:04,920 --> 01:42:06,920
These are the dreams I'll dream instead

1392
01:42:06,920 --> 01:42:08,920
This is the joy that's seldom spent

1393
01:42:08,920 --> 01:42:10,920
These are the tears we share

1394
01:42:10,920 --> 01:42:12,920
This is the fear, this is the dread

1395
01:42:12,920 --> 01:42:14,920
These are the gifts we have sent

1396
01:42:14,920 --> 01:42:16,920
This is what they represent

1397
01:42:16,920 --> 01:42:18,920
This is how I feel

1398
01:42:18,920 --> 01:42:20,920
They can know how I feel

1399
01:42:21,920 --> 01:42:23,920
I think you know how I feel

1400
01:42:24,920 --> 01:42:26,920
They don't think you know what I feel

1401
01:43:26,920 --> 01:43:32,420
The part where she's doing the ad-lib, you know, vocal stuff, you know, not the refrain.

1402
01:43:32,420 --> 01:43:33,420
Where she's rapping.

1403
01:43:33,420 --> 01:43:35,420
Where she's sorta, I guess, rapping.

1404
01:43:35,420 --> 01:43:37,920
That just totally did not work at all.

1405
01:43:37,920 --> 01:43:40,420
It was really bad in that sense.

1406
01:43:40,420 --> 01:43:46,420
But DJ Sammy needs to make some new songs that are not covers.

1407
01:43:46,420 --> 01:43:48,420
Please, please, please.

1408
01:43:48,420 --> 01:43:50,420
Or pick some better 80's stuff.

1409
01:43:50,420 --> 01:43:52,420
I mean, there's plenty of songs out there, you know.

1410
01:43:52,420 --> 01:43:55,420
Personally, I like, you know, Westin Girls, you know, that's a good song.

1411
01:43:55,420 --> 01:44:01,740
they did a really cool breakbeat version of it. Awesome. But that wasn't quite awesome.

1412
01:44:01,740 --> 01:44:03,700
It was about seven.

1413
01:44:03,700 --> 01:44:09,700
Alright. Mikl Tov, what did you think of that one? He's got his own mic. Hand him that one.

1414
01:44:09,700 --> 01:44:19,700
Yeah, I didn't really care for this song, because I was playing Meteos. I still, I heard

1415
01:44:19,700 --> 01:44:24,700
I've heard it, though, earlier today, and it's okay, but, um...

1416
01:44:24,700 --> 01:44:25,700
I'd...

1417
01:44:25,700 --> 01:44:28,700
Oh, crap, I forgot to pause!

1418
01:44:28,700 --> 01:44:31,700
I give it a four.

1419
01:44:31,700 --> 01:44:33,700
Alright, uh, Justin!

1420
01:44:33,700 --> 01:44:45,700
I give it a six, because, like Loki, I really was not digging the part where she was just kind of talking the song and not actually singing it, because she apparently can't talk, but she can sing.

1421
01:44:45,700 --> 01:44:47,700
Oh, well.

1422
01:44:47,700 --> 01:44:55,700
I don't even like Annie Lennox that much. She's like a weird fucking redheaded bitch.

1423
01:44:55,700 --> 01:44:59,700
But she's British! I thought you liked that!

1424
01:44:59,700 --> 01:45:09,700
You know, I like Imogen or Imogen Heap, because she's cool and British, but Annie Lennox is weird.

1425
01:45:09,700 --> 01:45:13,700
I don't know, I didn't like the original song, so I didn't care for this one either.

1426
01:45:13,700 --> 01:45:16,700
It's a scale of 1 to 10, is that what it is?

1427
01:45:16,700 --> 01:45:23,420
okay one John who your debut on the show John wow this is kind of scary

1428
01:45:23,420 --> 01:45:29,060
I was kind of bored with it to be honest I give it a three all right and I

1429
01:45:29,060 --> 01:45:33,180
give that song I agree the girl rapping was kind of weird and it doesn't hold a

1430
01:45:33,180 --> 01:45:38,060
candle to the Annie Lennox original but it makes me think about the Annie Lennox

1431
01:45:38,060 --> 01:45:43,660
original and why I love that redheaded bitch from the Eurydmics so I give it 20

1432
01:45:43,660 --> 01:45:47,660
Alright, let's go to the next song.

1433
01:45:47,660 --> 01:45:48,660
This is...

1434
01:45:48,660 --> 01:45:51,460
You're a red-headed bitch, that's all.

1435
01:45:51,460 --> 01:45:53,280
This is Dark Sakura's pick.

1436
01:45:53,280 --> 01:45:56,540
She put a song in tonight's cage match, even though she's not here tonight.

1437
01:45:56,540 --> 01:45:59,980
She's actually in chat, she just joined the chat room, so you guys can say hi to her over

1438
01:45:59,980 --> 01:46:00,980
there.

1439
01:46:00,980 --> 01:46:03,140
I think she'll be here in a little while before a podcast.

1440
01:46:03,140 --> 01:46:04,660
I think she's supposed to be, anyway.

1441
01:46:04,660 --> 01:46:05,660
We'll see.

1442
01:46:05,660 --> 01:46:07,780
But she put this song in for you guys.

1443
01:46:07,780 --> 01:46:09,780
It's an old favorite.

1444
01:46:09,780 --> 01:46:19,500
It's Hamasaki Ayumi with Fly High and it's Hal's 2000 Mix.

1445
01:46:19,500 --> 01:46:21,380
So here it is.

1446
01:46:21,380 --> 01:46:22,380
You know her.

1447
01:46:22,380 --> 01:46:23,380
Ayumi Hamasaki.

1448
01:46:23,380 --> 01:46:24,380
What?

1449
01:46:24,380 --> 01:46:28,260
What are you shaking your head for over there, low-key?

1450
01:46:28,260 --> 01:46:29,260
Let's play the song.

1451
01:46:29,260 --> 01:46:30,260
All right.

1452
01:46:30,260 --> 01:46:31,260
Let's play the song.

1453
01:46:31,260 --> 01:46:32,260
All right.

1454
01:46:32,260 --> 01:46:33,260
Here we go.

1455
01:46:33,260 --> 01:46:36,460
Ayumi Hamasaki fly high house 2000 mix. Here it is.

1456
01:47:03,260 --> 01:47:05,260
I know it best, aren't you?

1457
01:47:05,400 --> 01:47:06,920
It's real

1458
01:47:07,060 --> 01:47:10,040
If you get tired, I will get yourproof

1459
01:47:10,040 --> 01:47:13,800
Even though I do, it'll be for sure

1460
01:47:14,080 --> 01:47:32,940
And if Councillor

1461
01:49:32,940 --> 01:49:37,940
Me baby, more in love, baby

1462
01:50:32,940 --> 01:50:36,940
They can't

1463
01:50:53,940 --> 01:50:59,940
Alrighty, that was song number three, Ayumi, the one and only with Fly High, HAL's 2000 mix.

1464
01:50:59,940 --> 01:51:07,440
Let's go around and see, on a scale of one to ten, where that song lies for the folks in our studio right now.

1465
01:51:07,440 --> 01:51:07,940
Loki.

1466
01:51:07,940 --> 01:51:11,940
You know, I want to start off by saying that it was generic trance, but, um...

1467
01:51:11,940 --> 01:51:12,940
You're gonna get punched next week.

1468
01:51:12,940 --> 01:51:15,940
But, you know what? That was just a clusterfuck of...

1469
01:51:15,940 --> 01:51:23,940
Ah! No! No! No! Bad song. Bad. Bad. Bad song.

1470
01:51:23,940 --> 01:51:25,940
One. I'm sorry. It was awful.

1471
01:51:25,940 --> 01:51:28,940
And then I thought it was gonna end. I was like, oh thank god.

1472
01:51:28,940 --> 01:51:35,540
back. It came back and I was like no. Wow. Very very bad. I, you know what, me personally

1473
01:51:35,540 --> 01:51:39,300
on, oh and I don't get to go to the last, we gotta go to the same order. Shane, you're

1474
01:51:39,300 --> 01:51:44,460
up next. Okay, my first comment when that song was playing and we didn't have microphones

1475
01:51:44,460 --> 01:51:50,580
on was, wow, I didn't know Inuyasha was over. It sounds like an anime song that I don't

1476
01:51:50,580 --> 01:51:57,980
care about. Um, one, cause I don't understand the love of Japanese singers and how they're

1477
01:51:57,980 --> 01:52:02,980
They're so cool, and Ayumi Hamasaki, and...

1478
01:52:02,980 --> 01:52:03,980
One.

1479
01:52:03,980 --> 01:52:06,980
Alright, well let's see, let's move on.

1480
01:52:06,980 --> 01:52:07,980
Justin!

1481
01:52:07,980 --> 01:52:13,620
Even though it was a complete clusterfuck of a different, like, it went through rap,

1482
01:52:13,620 --> 01:52:17,980
it went through happy J-pop, it went through generic trance, and it went through hard trance,

1483
01:52:17,980 --> 01:52:19,980
I still kinda liked it.

1484
01:52:19,980 --> 01:52:21,980
So I give it a 7.

1485
01:52:21,980 --> 01:52:22,980
Alright.

1486
01:52:22,980 --> 01:52:23,980
Xtavor.

1487
01:52:23,980 --> 01:52:25,980
Damn those gill sellers.

1488
01:52:25,980 --> 01:52:29,980
I got it right that time, right?

1489
01:52:29,980 --> 01:52:33,980
Yeah, you did, but that's not the topic.

1490
01:52:33,980 --> 01:52:37,980
I'm sorry, the song was so boring.

1491
01:52:37,980 --> 01:52:41,980
I love Jamie, so I'm going to give it a 5 just for that.

1492
01:52:41,980 --> 01:52:45,980
John!

1493
01:52:45,980 --> 01:52:49,980
I'll just say that Loki's song was my favorite.

1494
01:52:49,980 --> 01:52:53,980
That's not a number on a scale of 1 to 10.

1495
01:52:53,980 --> 01:52:55,980
I'm a first time guest, so there.

1496
01:52:55,980 --> 01:52:57,980
That is nice. Just pick a number.

1497
01:53:25,980 --> 01:53:31,820
the middle but like not not everything in the middle like the rap in the middle

1498
01:53:31,820 --> 01:53:35,300
I didn't like but I liked like the first two minutes around the beginning I like

1499
01:53:35,300 --> 01:53:39,260
the last two minutes after the rap so like if we could cut like crop the song

1500
01:53:39,260 --> 01:53:43,300
it would be really really good but because it's not cropped I have to give

1501
01:53:43,300 --> 01:53:49,380
it like a seven so low-key you have a it sounded like it to the end of a 2d x

1502
01:53:49,380 --> 01:53:52,580
song I can't think for life me which Voyager

1503
01:53:52,580 --> 01:54:02,580
Big Voyager, okay, yeah, completely ripped those public, I'm sure they're royalty-free samples, they're available on CD somewhere because everybody uses them.

1504
01:54:02,580 --> 01:54:04,580
I have some of them, so I know.

1505
01:54:04,580 --> 01:54:11,580
Alright, kids, get ready to place those votes. Here's a recap of the three songs you can vote for in tonight's cage match.

1506
01:54:11,580 --> 01:54:18,580
Song number one is Cold Storage with Onyx.

1507
01:54:22,920 --> 01:54:28,020
And song number two you can vote for tonight is DJ Sami

1508
01:54:28,020 --> 01:54:35,020
with his Annie Lennox cover of Why.

1509
01:54:35,020 --> 01:54:49,020
And, song number three you can vote for tonight is Hamasaki Ayumi, Fly High, Howl's 2000 mix.

1510
01:54:49,020 --> 01:55:03,020
Place, Vote, Now, did you like how I got the big Voyager clip in there?

1511
01:55:03,020 --> 01:55:04,020
Place, Vote, Now.

1512
01:55:04,020 --> 01:55:09,020
Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.

1513
01:55:09,020 --> 01:55:12,020
Jamie, I'm already going to tell you, your vote doesn't count. I'm sorry to hear you say it.

1514
01:55:12,020 --> 01:55:13,020
Alright.

1515
01:55:13,020 --> 01:55:19,020
Hey, you know what? It kind of reminded me, like parts of that Ayumi song reminded me of like a max Ayumi or something like that.

1516
01:55:19,020 --> 01:55:23,020
You know, because they have the clips of like some hard techno stuff and then it went back into Ayumi.

1517
01:55:23,020 --> 01:55:24,020
It was just kind of weird.

1518
01:55:24,020 --> 01:55:26,020
Yeah, it was interesting.

1519
01:55:26,020 --> 01:55:27,020
It was interesting.

1520
01:55:27,020 --> 01:55:28,020
It was interesting.

1521
01:55:28,020 --> 01:55:32,020
Alright, this is the part of the show where I let Loki talk about what's going on in the sim scene.

1522
01:55:32,020 --> 01:55:39,020
Well, I'm sure there's something going on with TrinityMix 6, but I haven't checked, so it's going on.

1523
01:55:39,020 --> 01:55:44,020
Then there's also the important thing, because we're talking about quality sim files now,

1524
01:55:44,020 --> 01:55:50,020
is actually FoodMix 2, they have a date for it now when it's going to be coming out, September 15th.

1525
01:55:50,020 --> 01:55:59,020
And they've announced some of the compilations they're going to be pulling from diverse systems stuff to silly walker stuff.

1526
01:55:59,020 --> 01:56:11,020
And they're basically, I think they mentioned like D7, which was some really good stuff in there, and then some of the Silly Walker got a mix 3 or something like that. Really good songs.

1527
01:56:11,020 --> 01:56:22,020
So, it'll be interesting. I think they said over 50 songs. 50 new songs. So, I can't wait. It looks to be fun and we'll have to check it out on the 15th.

1528
01:56:22,020 --> 01:56:27,640
Justin, I know you follow the sim scene a little bit too, is there anything you want

1529
01:56:27,640 --> 01:56:28,640
to add?

1530
01:56:28,640 --> 01:56:30,640
Because Loki tends to miss things.

1531
01:56:30,640 --> 01:56:37,500
Yeah, actually one of my favorite personal sim file authors, the DWI Extreme series just

1532
01:56:37,500 --> 01:56:39,180
released one of their new mixes too.

1533
01:56:39,180 --> 01:56:43,500
It was DWI Extreme, Glistening to Infinity.

1534
01:56:43,500 --> 01:56:48,840
Lame name, I know, but it was actually a really good mix of songs, they have some Latin songs,

1535
01:56:48,840 --> 01:56:55,220
They have a bunch of R&B and dance songs, and it's actually a really good mix.

1536
01:56:55,220 --> 01:57:02,040
But the thing is, for this specific release, they're actually making it kind of in the

1537
01:57:02,040 --> 01:57:07,580
groove style, where they put in a bunch of challenge steps that were like, they range

1538
01:57:07,580 --> 01:57:12,360
from fun to bullshit hard, but they turn out a lot better than the stuff the in the groove

1539
01:57:12,360 --> 01:57:15,840
people have, so I recommend it.

1540
01:57:15,840 --> 01:57:25,840
Oh, and my cell's down still. That's good. Thank you for sharing. Thank you for that update.

1541
01:57:25,840 --> 01:57:26,840
They're still dead.

1542
01:57:26,840 --> 01:57:34,840
Yes. In related news, Princess Diana is still dead, just in case you were wondering.

1543
01:57:34,840 --> 01:57:39,840
Princess Di.

1544
01:57:39,840 --> 01:57:41,840
How rude.

1545
01:57:41,840 --> 01:57:58,840
And I would have loved to see, you know, the actual, you know how they always have those, like, funny, witty, you know, subject lines, you know, they're always on the newspapers, you know, the wonderful headlines. I wish, you know, there was a newspaper that put Princess Di, you know, D-I-B, yeah, because that'd be cool.

1546
01:57:58,840 --> 01:58:03,840
You know, you might be really offending somebody who's listening tonight. But isn't that what we were good at doing?

1547
01:58:03,840 --> 01:58:12,840
Well, you know, if I'm offending the princess Di, then they shouldn't, you know, she's probably rolling her grave, you know, hook her up to an alternator. Generate some power that way.

1548
01:58:16,840 --> 01:58:18,840
Let's change the subject, shall we?

1549
01:58:21,840 --> 01:58:26,840
I, I, some folks still wanted to call in on our Skype line.

1550
01:58:26,840 --> 01:58:30,560
So, I'm going to go ahead and open the Skype line back up.

1551
01:58:30,560 --> 01:58:34,360
It's available at www.orangelaungeradio.com.

1552
01:58:34,360 --> 01:58:41,000
Click on interact with us, and you too can join in on the fun here on orangelaungeradio.com.

1553
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:44,400
So I'm going to give them just a couple minutes to get in.

1554
01:58:44,400 --> 01:58:47,020
Now's your chance on the Skype line.

1555
01:58:47,020 --> 01:58:52,600
In the meantime, I wanted to mention this because Rini linked me to this.

1556
01:58:52,600 --> 01:58:53,600
Hold on.

1557
01:58:53,600 --> 01:59:01,200
problems getting in a couple minutes to get in that sounds like you know and

1558
01:59:01,200 --> 01:59:06,680
Nicole Smith boarding a plane you know it's like come on I'm ready for you

1559
01:59:06,680 --> 01:59:19,480
anyway I'm supposed to mention this something that Renee linked me to and I

1560
01:59:19,480 --> 01:59:31,980
I think this came off of the DDR Freak forum somehow, and it's basically linked to on Konami of USA's website for Xtreme 2.

1561
01:59:31,980 --> 01:59:38,480
There's actually an online user agreement, and you can read all these details, and it's basically the blah blah blah blah blahs about the game.

1562
01:59:38,480 --> 01:59:43,480
Well, somewhere in here it mentions in the blah blah blah something about,

1563
01:59:43,480 --> 01:59:50,480
This online game does not have any automatic save feature, and therefore will ask you to save your information to a memory card or hard disk drive.

1564
01:59:50,480 --> 01:59:55,480
So people are saying like, OMG, this game might have a hard disk drive support on it.

1565
01:59:55,480 --> 02:00:04,480
So, I don't know. I tend to think this is just some generic agreement that happens to have Konami's name inserted in there.

1566
02:00:04,480 --> 02:00:09,480
But we'll see. Hey, turn down your speakers, buddy, and you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1567
02:00:09,480 --> 02:00:11,480
Yo, Sky, what's up?

1568
02:00:11,480 --> 02:00:13,480
Hey, what's up?

1569
02:00:13,480 --> 02:00:15,480
It's Kuwabara.

1570
02:00:15,480 --> 02:00:21,480
Hello Kuwabara. I'm hearing myself. Can you turn down your speakers or move the headphones or something?

1571
02:00:21,480 --> 02:00:24,480
Sorry, it's a built-in mic. I'm actually five.

1572
02:00:24,480 --> 02:00:31,480
Oh. That's alright. Well, give us your thought because I'm hearing myself, so give us your thought and then we'll respond to it.

1573
02:00:31,480 --> 02:00:33,480
Thought on what?

1574
02:00:33,480 --> 02:00:35,480
Why you're calling in tonight.

1575
02:00:35,480 --> 02:00:46,480
I just wanted to call in, just to talk about stuff, I really like 2DX and stuff, just because, you know, I want to change the subject from ITG and DDR, because, you know, it's starting to piss me off.

1576
02:00:46,480 --> 02:00:53,480
Okay, well, what is it you want to say that's not ITG, DDR-related?

1577
02:00:53,480 --> 02:00:57,480
I don't know, I really love Noria.

1578
02:00:57,480 --> 02:00:59,480
You love what?

1579
02:00:59,480 --> 02:01:00,480
Noria.

1580
02:01:00,480 --> 02:01:03,480
Noria? That's 2DX-related.

1581
02:01:03,480 --> 02:01:14,480
I played a Noria song for you last break.

1582
02:01:14,480 --> 02:01:19,480
What's the thing you like most about 2DX?

1583
02:01:19,480 --> 02:01:23,480
I like 2DX because of the key sounds.

1584
02:01:23,480 --> 02:01:26,480
Wouldn't it be sweet if there was a remix mode?

1585
02:01:26,480 --> 02:01:29,480
Yeah, I'm sure.

1586
02:01:29,480 --> 02:01:34,480
Well, you better get in your final thought because Jamie's getting pissed at me because I didn't answer her call.

1587
02:01:34,480 --> 02:01:35,480
Jinx.

1588
02:01:35,480 --> 02:01:44,480
I'm really pissed off because of BBNAUS and stuff because they're just delaying 10th style because of that and I really want 10th style, you know.

1589
02:01:44,480 --> 02:01:47,480
Why are you ticked off about BBNAUS?

1590
02:01:47,480 --> 02:01:53,480
Because they're delaying 10th style because of it and there are a lot of songs in 10th style that I really want.

1591
02:01:53,480 --> 02:01:55,480
Oh, wait. Can you say that?

1592
02:01:55,480 --> 02:01:56,480
Can you say that?

1593
02:01:56,480 --> 02:01:57,480
Oh, never mind. Okay.

1594
02:01:57,480 --> 02:02:02,480
Okay, nevermind. Okay. Well, it's our turn, dammit!

1595
02:02:02,480 --> 02:02:04,480
Wait a minute, yeah, I'll do it.

1596
02:02:04,480 --> 02:02:06,480
Alright, let me go talk to her, hurry up.

1597
02:02:06,480 --> 02:02:09,480
Who says they're- oh crap, that's loud!

1598
02:02:09,480 --> 02:02:10,480
Sorry.

1599
02:02:10,480 --> 02:02:12,480
Okay, I'll talk really quietly.

1600
02:02:12,480 --> 02:02:17,480
Who said that they're delaying temp style because of Beatmania US?

1601
02:02:17,480 --> 02:02:21,480
Oh, I just thought it up, because, you know, it makes sense, doesn't it?

1602
02:02:21,480 --> 02:02:24,480
Well, don't listen to your brain.

1603
02:02:24,480 --> 02:02:28,480
That's something Konami would do, though. It just makes sense.

1604
02:02:28,480 --> 02:02:29,480
Why would they do that?

1605
02:02:29,480 --> 02:02:30,480
Well, they got a lot of people working there.

1606
02:02:30,480 --> 02:02:33,480
That's not a nice thing.

1607
02:02:33,480 --> 02:02:34,480
Konami's nice.

1608
02:02:34,480 --> 02:02:39,480
Besides, they're working on, they have, you know, the U.S. offices that work on the Mania U.S.,

1609
02:02:39,480 --> 02:02:43,480
and then you have the Japanese offices that work on the Mania 2DX.

1610
02:02:43,480 --> 02:02:48,480
I don't actually think that's how it's working, but I don't think they're delaying anything.

1611
02:02:48,480 --> 02:02:49,480
Don't listen to your brain, you know.

1612
02:02:49,480 --> 02:02:50,480
Oh, yeah, that's right.

1613
02:02:50,480 --> 02:02:51,480
All right.

1614
02:02:51,480 --> 02:02:53,480
Coolabara, I'm gonna go ahead and let you go,

1615
02:02:53,480 --> 02:02:56,480
Thank you for calling in, and have a great day, okay?

1616
02:02:56,480 --> 02:02:57,480
Echo.

1617
02:02:57,480 --> 02:02:58,480
All right.

1618
02:02:58,480 --> 02:02:59,480
Later.

1619
02:02:59,480 --> 02:03:00,480
Later.

1620
02:03:00,480 --> 02:03:01,480
All right.

1621
02:03:01,480 --> 02:03:02,480
So, Skypline's still open.

1622
02:03:02,480 --> 02:03:04,480
DarkSakura, who's probably ticked off on me, but that's all right.

1623
02:03:04,480 --> 02:03:05,480
That guy got in first.

1624
02:03:05,480 --> 02:03:06,480
What can I say?

1625
02:03:06,480 --> 02:03:09,480
Now you know what it's like to be one of our listeners trying to get in on the Skypline.

1626
02:03:09,480 --> 02:03:13,480
If we took a picture just then, we would have an echo image.

1627
02:03:13,480 --> 02:03:16,480
OMG, was that a hint?

1628
02:03:16,480 --> 02:03:18,480
OMG, was that a clue?

1629
02:03:18,480 --> 02:03:19,480
Was that a clue?

1630
02:03:19,480 --> 02:03:22,480
Go back to the freak board.

1631
02:03:22,480 --> 02:03:36,480
Alright, so just because TenStyle is, um, or I'm sorry, just because, sorry, just because BeatMania US is being worked on doesn't mean that TenStyle is not being worked on.

1632
02:03:36,480 --> 02:03:45,480
And it hasn't even been announced yet, so who knows if they're actually even doing it, but the release of a US game would not stop the production of a Japanese game.

1633
02:03:45,480 --> 02:03:48,600
Alright, from the man on the inside himself.

1634
02:03:48,600 --> 02:03:49,960
Anyway, let's go to our skype line.

1635
02:03:49,960 --> 02:03:51,080
Hi, you're on Orangetown's radio.

1636
02:03:53,800 --> 02:03:54,300
Hello?

1637
02:03:55,160 --> 02:03:56,120
Uh, can you hear me?

1638
02:03:56,120 --> 02:03:57,320
Yes, now we can. What's up?

1639
02:03:59,560 --> 02:04:02,280
Oh my god, what a day.

1640
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:06,920
This is the one and only Dark Sakura, for those that may not recognize the voice.

1641
02:04:06,920 --> 02:04:08,440
This is Dark Sakura, ladies and gentlemen.

1642
02:04:09,640 --> 02:04:10,680
Here too, say hi.

1643
02:04:11,240 --> 02:04:11,740
Hello.

1644
02:04:12,360 --> 02:04:12,860
Hi Dan.

1645
02:04:12,860 --> 02:04:17,860
There's a little bit of lag, DarkSakura, so just tell us about your day.

1646
02:04:17,860 --> 02:04:24,860
I spent all day at Classic Gaming Expo looking at a bunch of stuff that I wanted to buy,

1647
02:04:24,860 --> 02:04:32,860
and I found myself actually put into position of translator for some guy at this booth selling a bunch of Famicon,

1648
02:04:32,860 --> 02:04:37,860
and Super Famicon, and Mega Drive games, and PC Engine U-Cards,

1649
02:04:37,860 --> 02:04:42,140
cards, and I actually didn't get to go to any of the panels

1650
02:04:42,140 --> 02:04:44,140
because I was busy drooling at stuff and looking at the

1651
02:04:44,140 --> 02:04:47,460
museum, which actually wasn't as impressive as it was

1652
02:04:47,460 --> 02:04:49,820
before, it's just all the same stuff.

1653
02:04:49,820 --> 02:04:52,820
But they're going to be taking a year off next year and

1654
02:04:52,820 --> 02:04:55,580
coming back in 2007, and hopefully that's going to be

1655
02:04:55,580 --> 02:04:56,860
bigger and better.

1656
02:04:56,860 --> 02:05:00,460
This year was kind of eh, but I got to meet the guys who run

1657
02:05:00,460 --> 02:05:02,580
a retro gaming radio.

1658
02:05:02,580 --> 02:05:03,100
Cool.

1659
02:05:03,100 --> 02:05:06,020
Who are pretty big.

1660
02:05:06,020 --> 02:05:10,420
We actually had a pretty long discussion about Don Bluth.

1661
02:05:10,420 --> 02:05:14,020
Oh, okay.

1662
02:05:14,020 --> 02:05:17,220
We also, uh, I also got to meet, um,

1663
02:05:17,220 --> 02:05:18,760
this person who is

1664
02:05:18,760 --> 02:05:22,980
built basically a miniature Nintendo that runs the Famicom and Nintendo games.

1665
02:05:22,980 --> 02:05:25,700
I took some pictures of that. They'll be up on the site in a few days.

1666
02:05:25,700 --> 02:05:28,680
Is that the same one from E3?

1667
02:05:28,680 --> 02:05:32,900
Um, I don't remember because I don't think I saw him at E3. It was

1668
02:05:32,900 --> 02:05:34,900
Is it called the Messiah system or something?

1669
02:05:34,900 --> 02:05:35,900
Yeah, I think it's the one we played.

1670
02:05:35,900 --> 02:05:36,900
That sounds vaguely familiar.

1671
02:05:36,900 --> 02:05:37,900
The one I played Duck Hunt.

1672
02:05:37,900 --> 02:05:40,900
But I don't remember it supporting Famicom, just the old school Nintendo.

1673
02:05:40,900 --> 02:05:41,900
But maybe they wouldn't have been showing that.

1674
02:05:41,900 --> 02:05:49,900
It's got a Famicom loader on top, like the Famicom was, and then a front loader for the Nintendo games.

1675
02:05:49,900 --> 02:05:53,900
And it also has hookups in back, if you can get a hold of the disc system.

1676
02:05:53,900 --> 02:06:00,900
Oh, so you can hook up like an old school Famicom disc system, so you can play like the original, like, oh, what was that game they based?

1677
02:06:00,900 --> 02:06:01,900
Doki Doki Panic!

1678
02:06:01,900 --> 02:06:03,900
Zelda II was a disc game.

1679
02:06:03,900 --> 02:06:05,900
Doki Doki Panic's the one I always think of.

1680
02:06:05,900 --> 02:06:07,900
So it was the first one.

1681
02:06:07,900 --> 02:06:09,900
Metroid, Kid Icarus.

1682
02:06:09,900 --> 02:06:11,900
Zelda II was a disc game?

1683
02:06:11,900 --> 02:06:13,900
Excitebike, because it had save. Remember Excitebike?

1684
02:06:13,900 --> 02:06:15,900
Excitebike.

1685
02:06:15,900 --> 02:06:17,900
Now Doki Doki Panic.

1686
02:06:17,900 --> 02:06:19,900
This is what pissed me off about Classic Gaming Expo last year.

1687
02:06:19,900 --> 02:06:21,900
Although I had such a great time.

1688
02:06:21,900 --> 02:06:25,900
And I had an especially good time watching Dark Sakura run and hit the button on the bathroom wall.

1689
02:06:25,900 --> 02:06:27,900
But we won't talk about that again.

1690
02:06:27,900 --> 02:06:38,900
One thing that kind of ticked me off about Classic Gaming Expo last year was that there were not a lot of actual classic arcade games. Did they fix that this year, or another disappointment?

1691
02:06:38,900 --> 02:06:43,900
The whole reason behind that, and it makes a lot of sense, is... What's the name of that thing called, Dan?

1692
02:06:43,900 --> 02:06:44,900
California Xtreme.

1693
02:06:44,900 --> 02:06:50,900
California Xtreme, where they... That's basically replacing all of the big, massive arcade of retro games.

1694
02:06:50,900 --> 02:06:56,900
They had more games this year and almost all of them worked.

1695
02:06:56,900 --> 02:07:00,900
They had a millipede, mousetrap, gorf, tempest.

1696
02:07:00,900 --> 02:07:02,900
Dude, mousetrap is awesome.

1697
02:07:02,900 --> 02:07:05,900
Dude, that's why I love my Colecovision.

1698
02:07:05,900 --> 02:07:07,900
The mousetrap and gorf.

1699
02:07:07,900 --> 02:07:10,900
Gorf? Who plays gorf?

1700
02:07:10,900 --> 02:07:14,900
Dude, gorf was my favorite game when the Colecovision was out.

1701
02:07:14,900 --> 02:07:18,900
I was a master at gorf and space fury.

1702
02:07:18,900 --> 02:07:22,900
worked on, I think, a ColecoVision emulator for either the DS or the PSP.

1703
02:07:22,900 --> 02:07:26,900
Really? Yes. Oh, that's kind of cool. Very cool.

1704
02:07:26,900 --> 02:07:30,900
So, what was probably the worst thing

1705
02:07:30,900 --> 02:07:34,900
in your opinion about Classic Gaming Expo, something you needed improving on?

1706
02:07:34,900 --> 02:07:38,900
It just felt kind of empty. What?

1707
02:07:38,900 --> 02:07:42,900
Dan said it was dinky. Well, it was a different hotel this year, right?

1708
02:07:42,900 --> 02:07:46,900
Yeah, it was at the Hyatt and Burlingame.

1709
02:07:46,900 --> 02:07:55,900
We were actually in San Francisco, I think.

1710
02:07:55,900 --> 02:08:00,900
But there were people there who heard of us.

1711
02:08:00,900 --> 02:08:11,900
But I made some contacts, we will be having more on that in the future once I've got something official going on.

1712
02:08:11,900 --> 02:08:21,900
For the people who were there, they were the folks that were really into it. Oh, by the way, there was a new Lego sculpture.

1713
02:08:21,900 --> 02:08:23,900
Of what?

1714
02:08:23,900 --> 02:08:25,900
Pac-Man. I took a picture.

1715
02:08:25,900 --> 02:08:27,900
Oh, that's cool.

1716
02:08:27,900 --> 02:08:34,900
And for the Moby Games thing, Dan got placed number four and got me a T-shirt.

1717
02:08:34,900 --> 02:08:35,900
Oh, cool. Cool.

1718
02:08:35,900 --> 02:08:37,900
For the whole show.

1719
02:08:37,900 --> 02:08:38,900
Oh, wow.

1720
02:08:38,900 --> 02:08:39,900
For the whole show.

1721
02:08:39,900 --> 02:08:40,900
For what game?

1722
02:08:40,900 --> 02:08:45,900
We have to name the screenshot.

1723
02:08:45,900 --> 02:08:49,900
Oh, I remember that thing. Okay. I remember that. I remember that.

1724
02:08:49,900 --> 02:08:56,900
What was the contest they had last year where we all had to play the Stampede on Atari?

1725
02:08:56,900 --> 02:08:58,900
Did they do something like that again this year?

1726
02:08:58,900 --> 02:09:02,900
I think that there was some type of game going on on like a widescreen.

1727
02:09:02,900 --> 02:09:06,900
One thing, Rob, I think that you'll get a kick out of in the museum room.

1728
02:09:06,900 --> 02:09:13,900
They had a Jaguar hooked up onto their projector, and it was Tempest X, which was Tempest 2000.

1729
02:09:19,900 --> 02:09:28,900
Yes, 8-Bit Weapon was back. Unfortunately, I was sort of out of cash because somebody found the core graphics in Strider on the PC Engine Duo.

1730
02:09:28,900 --> 02:09:35,900
So I would have picked up one of their CDs, but I think I still got their card from last year. I meant to contact them.

1731
02:09:35,900 --> 02:09:42,900
And there's also another person there just playing a bunch of game music on a keyboard.

1732
02:09:42,900 --> 02:09:48,900
Oh, that's kind of cool. Just like a bum or somebody who was actually led into the show and doing all this stuff.

1733
02:09:48,900 --> 02:09:50,900
No, just somebody who was part of the show.

1734
02:09:50,900 --> 02:09:51,900
That's cool.

1735
02:09:51,900 --> 02:10:02,900
There was also, for the people who were there, the Atari people were back, of course Moby Games, the Intellivision folks were there.

1736
02:10:03,900 --> 02:10:06,900
Still whoring out that Intellivision collection from like three years ago?

1737
02:10:06,900 --> 02:10:24,900
Yep. There's also a couple guys there who were selling MVS cartridges. For anyone who doesn't know, the MVS cartridges are the Neo Geo games and homemade JAMA units to play them on.

1738
02:10:24,900 --> 02:10:27,900
And sell them like, you know, a-

1739
02:10:30,900 --> 02:10:32,900
Whoa. Whoa, whoa.

1740
02:10:33,900 --> 02:10:36,900
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1741
02:10:36,900 --> 02:10:40,900
Whoa, Jamie, hold up, hold up. Jamie, your voice went like crazy there for a minute.

1742
02:10:40,900 --> 02:10:42,900
You sounded like an evil lord, a demon.

1743
02:10:42,900 --> 02:10:45,900
From like, from like an Atari 2600 game.

1744
02:10:45,900 --> 02:10:47,900
We gotta save that clip for the next intro.

1745
02:10:47,900 --> 02:10:49,900
That was crazy.

1746
02:10:49,900 --> 02:10:52,900
Start over again with that paragraph, Jamie.

1747
02:10:52,900 --> 02:11:01,020
Okay, um I there who the selling a basically anything any see practically it was a

1748
02:11:01,660 --> 02:11:07,820
Duo our door our duo our ex core graphics a bunch of turbo graphics

1749
02:11:08,460 --> 02:11:10,460
turbo turbo duo games

1750
02:11:10,900 --> 02:11:17,460
PC engine duo games arcade cards you name it. He had a bunch of good stuff. We picked up like five HuCard games

1751
02:11:18,220 --> 02:11:20,220
mm-hmm

1752
02:11:20,220 --> 02:11:49,220
But his other main thing though is that he, he mods consoles, he actually has basically regionless duo that'll sell, because the one thing is that the duo, the CD will read any region and has no problem with replicas, however the cards themselves are not universal and there's not any real good adapter, but he's got, he's modded a universal system for it.

1753
02:11:49,220 --> 02:11:57,220
And he does video mods, super guns, jamma units. He actually has made this really tiny jamma unit for MVS cartridges.

1754
02:11:57,220 --> 02:11:58,220
Oh, cool.

1755
02:11:58,220 --> 02:12:02,220
I don't know if an explanation of those came through, but the MVS cartridges are the Neo Geo games.

1756
02:12:02,220 --> 02:12:04,220
Huh.

1757
02:12:04,220 --> 02:12:10,220
I had wished that there were, you know, the modified cartridges to play on the AVS systems.

1758
02:12:10,220 --> 02:12:11,220
Hmm.

1759
02:12:11,220 --> 02:12:15,220
Yeah, sorry. Dan's over here correcting me.

1760
02:12:15,220 --> 02:12:16,220
Okay.

1761
02:12:16,220 --> 02:12:27,220
Also, again, the television people were there, like I said. The people with the massive Atari stuff were there. Expensive Lynx games, oh my god.

1762
02:12:27,220 --> 02:12:36,220
But the booth that I liked the best, I'd have to say, was the guy from Japan just selling stuff.

1763
02:12:36,220 --> 02:12:38,220
Oh, there's just a random guy from Japan selling stuff?

1764
02:12:38,220 --> 02:12:48,220
He was selling Famicon, Super Nintendo, um, cue cards, um, all kinds of stuff that were like five games for ten dollars.

1765
02:12:48,220 --> 02:13:05,220
So I picked up Final Fantasy II on the Famicon, uh, Mappy Land in the box on the Famicon, Final Fantasy V for Super Famicon, Puyo Puyo for the Mega Drive, and, uh, Legend of the Valkyrie for PC Engine.

1766
02:13:05,220 --> 02:13:07,540
that was ten bucks for all that

1767
02:13:07,540 --> 02:13:10,820
ten dollars you can make a killing for them and i think you

1768
02:13:10,820 --> 02:13:13,140
and i had a price tag of twenty dollars on it

1769
02:13:13,140 --> 02:13:16,020
well you can make a killing for them on ebay

1770
02:13:16,020 --> 02:13:19,940
yeah but i actually want to play it

1771
02:13:19,940 --> 02:13:22,260
all right we'll see

1772
02:13:22,260 --> 02:13:24,600
who knows maybe i'll get you know

1773
02:13:24,600 --> 02:13:28,220
fed up in one of those will become a prize for one of our loyal listeners

1774
02:13:28,220 --> 02:13:32,820
ooh that'll be cool all right sounds good

1775
02:13:32,820 --> 02:13:34,620
stop teasing him

1776
02:13:34,620 --> 02:13:40,620
Alright, well we're going to go ahead and we'll hear more about Classic Amy Exwell on this week's podcast.

1777
02:13:40,620 --> 02:13:41,620
Can I hang up on me?

1778
02:13:41,620 --> 02:13:46,620
I'm not going to hang up on you, but we have to get to the FUs of the week and the other stuff too in a break.

1779
02:13:46,620 --> 02:13:47,620
Hello?

1780
02:13:47,620 --> 02:13:48,620
Because I really got to go to the bathroom.

1781
02:13:48,620 --> 02:13:50,620
That was crap.

1782
02:13:50,620 --> 02:13:52,620
No, it's still...

1783
02:13:52,620 --> 02:13:56,620
Hello? Are you even listening to me? Hello?

1784
02:13:56,620 --> 02:13:57,620
Is she there?

1785
02:13:57,620 --> 02:13:58,620
Hello?

1786
02:13:58,620 --> 02:13:59,620
Whoa, hi.

1787
02:13:59,620 --> 02:14:03,620
Whoa, she went into evil warlord voice there again for a minute.

1788
02:14:03,620 --> 02:14:07,620
Anything else you want to say to the listeners before we go?

1789
02:14:07,620 --> 02:14:10,620
Um, words.

1790
02:14:10,620 --> 02:14:11,620
All right.

1791
02:14:11,620 --> 02:14:12,620
Lobster.

1792
02:14:12,620 --> 02:14:16,620
All right, have a good one, DarkSockGirl. We'll see you back for the podcast.

1793
02:14:16,620 --> 02:14:18,620
Reject false icons.

1794
02:14:18,620 --> 02:14:21,620
Later. Bye.

1795
02:14:21,620 --> 02:14:23,620
She beat me to the hang-up button.

1796
02:14:23,620 --> 02:14:24,620
I like that.

1797
02:14:24,620 --> 02:14:26,620
Yeah, that was weird.

1798
02:14:26,620 --> 02:14:29,620
Like, when she was, I am the evil Lord Satan.

1799
02:14:29,620 --> 02:14:31,620
Like, that was really scary.

1800
02:14:31,620 --> 02:14:38,300
out all right anyway we're gonna go to a break because I have to pee and then

1801

1805
02:14:52,900 --> 02:14:55,900
So we'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio after this.

1806
02:15:22,900 --> 02:15:24,820
I'll just get a good one

1807
02:15:25,820 --> 02:15:28,380
Good and bad, bad, bad, bad, bad

1808
02:15:28,380 --> 02:15:30,380
Let me go, let me go, let me go

1809
02:16:28,380 --> 02:16:30,380
Uhh...

1810
02:16:30,380 --> 02:16:32,760
I'm sick, dream of a life

1811
02:16:32,760 --> 02:16:34,760
I still have no life

1812
02:16:34,760 --> 02:16:36,760
I'm sick

1813
02:16:36,760 --> 02:16:38,760
Uhh...

1814
02:16:38,760 --> 02:16:40,760
I'm sick

1815
02:16:40,760 --> 02:16:42,760
Uhh...

1816
02:16:42,760 --> 02:16:44,760
Uhh...

1817
02:16:44,760 --> 02:16:46,760
Uhh...

1818
02:16:46,760 --> 02:16:48,760
Uhh...

1819
02:16:48,760 --> 02:16:50,760
Uhh...

1820
02:16:50,760 --> 02:16:52,760
Uhh...

1821
02:16:52,760 --> 02:16:54,760
Uhh...

1822
02:16:54,760 --> 02:16:56,760
Oh

1823
02:17:24,760 --> 02:17:30,760
Can't be alone

1824
02:17:36,760 --> 02:17:39,760
You don't have to believe in a Hollywood girl

1825
02:17:39,760 --> 02:17:41,760
But it's all solid policies

1826
02:17:41,760 --> 02:17:44,760
You wanted to do, so you have got this

1827
02:17:44,760 --> 02:17:47,760
And you know that

1828
02:17:47,760 --> 02:17:50,760
You wanted to lose in a Hollywood town

1829
02:17:50,760 --> 02:17:53,760
To be a soul that you always need

1830
02:17:53,760 --> 02:17:57,760
But I can't listen to my own words tonight

1831
02:17:57,760 --> 02:18:00,260
I'm just watching you and I'm sad

1832
02:18:00,260 --> 02:18:03,260
So I don't mind that I made a start

1833
02:18:03,260 --> 02:18:09,260
To you everywhere I thought you were all right

1834
02:18:09,260 --> 02:18:13,260
You are the sky

1835
02:18:13,260 --> 02:18:15,260
I'm just watching you and I'm sad

1836
02:18:15,260 --> 02:18:18,260
You're everything you think I am

1837
02:18:18,260 --> 02:18:20,260
Everything you think I am

1838
02:18:20,260 --> 02:18:22,760
I can't believe that I'm hiding

1839
02:18:22,760 --> 02:18:25,760
I need a part of you on my own

1840
02:18:25,760 --> 02:18:28,260
I will leave you and leave you

1841
02:18:28,260 --> 02:18:31,260
Though you would last me the most

1842
02:18:31,260 --> 02:18:34,260
I'm not the kind that I need to stay

1843
02:18:34,260 --> 02:18:35,260
I'm falling down

1844
02:19:05,260 --> 02:19:09,260
I am the Roma, six-legged Roma,

1845
02:19:09,260 --> 02:19:13,260
Lived until the captain keeps the streets away.

1846
02:19:13,260 --> 02:19:17,260
I'm Romeo, Juliet.

1847
02:19:17,260 --> 02:19:21,260
I'm Romeo, Juliet.

1848
02:19:21,260 --> 02:19:25,260
I'm Romeo, Juliet.

1849
02:19:25,260 --> 02:19:28,260
I'm Romeo, Juliet.

1850
02:19:28,260 --> 02:19:31,260
I'll scream for you, right to heaven.

1851
02:19:31,260 --> 02:19:35,260
And time was made for passion

1852
02:19:35,260 --> 02:19:39,260
The only thing I know is faith

1853
02:19:39,260 --> 02:19:43,260
And fear is a distraction

1854
02:19:43,260 --> 02:19:47,260
Fear is a distraction

1855
02:19:55,260 --> 02:19:59,260
I am a robot

1856
02:20:29,260 --> 02:20:34,260
I found this strange attraction

1857
02:20:34,260 --> 02:20:38,260
It was made for you, my dear

1858
02:20:38,260 --> 02:20:41,260
It was made for my show

1859
02:20:41,260 --> 02:20:44,260
The only thing I know is that

1860
02:20:44,260 --> 02:20:48,260
I could use that inspiration

1861
02:20:48,260 --> 02:20:53,260
To use that inspiration

1862
02:20:53,260 --> 02:21:15,140
Why, why did you have to go away?

1863
02:21:15,140 --> 02:21:17,140
It's always hard to say

1864
02:21:17,140 --> 02:21:22,140
It keeps on going over, over you

1865
02:21:22,140 --> 02:21:26,140
Tell me was it really true romance

1866
02:21:26,140 --> 02:21:29,140
Or just fantasy

1867
02:21:29,140 --> 02:21:32,140
If you believe what we're still through

1868
02:21:32,140 --> 02:21:35,140
You're hanging out with someone new

1869
02:21:35,140 --> 02:21:37,140
Still you're in my heart baby

1870
02:21:37,140 --> 02:21:40,140
It's my heart, always in my heart

1871
02:21:40,140 --> 02:21:42,140
You never leave my heart

1872
02:21:42,140 --> 02:21:46,140
Tell me, tell you in my heart, beat down in my heart

1873
02:21:46,140 --> 02:21:50,140
Fill me with ecstasy

1874
02:21:55,140 --> 02:21:58,140
Oh baby, no baby

1875
02:21:58,140 --> 02:22:01,140
Can't take you down

1876
02:22:01,140 --> 02:22:04,140
Was it just a fantasy?

1877
02:22:04,140 --> 02:22:07,140
What I've done to feel your reality?

1878
02:22:07,140 --> 02:22:10,140
Oh baby, can't you just see

1879
02:22:10,140 --> 02:22:16,140
Then I can't go on, leave it without you

1880
02:22:16,140 --> 02:22:20,140
Till, till you rip my heart, never leave my heart

1881
02:22:20,140 --> 02:22:22,140
Now it's forevermore

1882
02:22:22,140 --> 02:22:26,140
Till, till you rip my heart, always in my heart

1883
02:22:26,140 --> 02:22:30,140
When will I ever be free?

1884
02:22:30,140 --> 02:22:41,820
After this song, we'll be having a Let Them Move marathon.

1885
02:22:41,820 --> 02:22:42,820
Noooooo!

1886
02:22:42,820 --> 02:22:44,900
Just kidding.

1887
02:22:44,900 --> 02:22:49,820
Orange Lounge Radio, crap-free Vivani radio.

1888
02:22:49,820 --> 02:22:54,700
We're back here on Orange Lounge Radio, and in that break you heard Naoki was still in

what we have uh...

1898
02:23:24,120 --> 02:23:27,440
john and justin went in the front room to go watch television because i guess

1899
02:23:27,440 --> 02:23:32,600
that's more interesting than the show. No, there's a certain show that John has to watch

1900
02:23:32,600 --> 02:23:36,880
every week, and I'm sure a lot of you out there are no different, although you folks

1901
02:23:36,880 --> 02:23:41,600
should consider investing in a VCR or TiVo or something.

1902
02:23:41,600 --> 02:23:44,800
I was reading here about Dancing Stage Max.

1903
02:23:44,800 --> 02:23:48,080
What's up with Dancing Stage Max? I know there was a little news on Dancing Stage Max this

1904
02:23:48,080 --> 02:23:49,080
week, so what's up with that?

1905
02:23:49,080 --> 02:23:55,320
There's a bit more now because they've made it some games convention or whatever. It was

1906
02:23:55,320 --> 02:23:57,400
In Europe, they've got some more stuff.

1907
02:23:57,400 --> 02:24:04,640
They have songs by the artists V, Hip2Hip.

1908
02:24:04,640 --> 02:24:09,920
Then they have this group, The Jam, Going Underground,

02:24:09,920 --> 02:24:14,160
Sugar Babes with In The Middle, Sophie Ellis

1910

Beckster with Mixed Up World, Labelle with Lady Marmalade.

1911
02:24:19,760 --> 02:24:21,720
Wait, like Patti Labelle?

1912
02:24:21,720 --> 02:24:23,680
No, she never sang that song, though, did she?

1913
02:24:23,680 --> 02:24:24,360
It says Labelle.

1914
02:24:24,360 --> 02:24:26,360
I am just telling you what it says.

1915
02:24:26,360 --> 02:24:28,360
Who sang that song originally?

1916
02:24:28,360 --> 02:24:30,360
Adam Ant with Goody Two Shoes.

1917
02:24:30,360 --> 02:24:32,360
Oh, that's kind of interesting.

1918
02:24:32,360 --> 02:24:34,360
Franz Ferdinand with Michael.

1919
02:24:34,360 --> 02:24:36,360
Natasha Bedingfield with These Words.

1920
02:24:36,360 --> 02:24:38,360
I love this song. Hold on, I have a clip of this song.

1921
02:24:38,360 --> 02:24:40,360
I love this song.

1922
02:24:44,360 --> 02:24:46,360
And it will have the video from what I understand.

1923
02:24:46,360 --> 02:24:49,080
The

1924
02:24:49,080 --> 02:24:52,460
You know they're going to hoard that Do Do Do thing

1925
02:24:52,460 --> 02:24:55,660
in the shelves or something.

1926
02:24:55,660 --> 02:25:00,080
Al Kazzar with This is the World We Live In. Fat Boy Slim with Wonderful Night

1927
02:25:00,080 --> 02:25:04,480

the pole of a vision dances and choruses.

1929
02:25:08,040 --> 02:25:11,040
from Ozz. Yuzo Koshiro, You Gotta Move It.

1930
02:25:11,040 --> 02:25:15,440
Steps, you might remember them from Kajidi

1931
02:25:15,440 --> 02:25:17,440
Yeah.

1932
02:25:17,440 --> 02:25:20,680
Tragedy. No, I was thinking of Sepp's with, um,

1933
02:25:20,680 --> 02:25:24,960
was it five, six, seven, eight? I just know their song Tragedy because my,

1934
02:25:24,960 --> 02:25:29,000
my, now, I've, you know, I'm a gay guy myself, so I don't make fun of other gay guys

1935
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:30,600
very often, but I used to live with a

1936
02:25:30,600 --> 02:25:35,400
flaming homosexual, okay? Flaming homosexual, love him to death, he was a

1937
02:25:35,400 --> 02:25:39,280
flaming homosexual, and he used to listen to that song and do the little dance and everything with his solo.

1938
02:25:39,280 --> 02:25:43,240
Um, Chain Reaction, Christina Milan with Dip It Low,

1939
02:25:43,240 --> 02:25:44,240
Awesome.

1940
02:25:44,240 --> 02:25:45,240
Dip it low.

1941
02:25:45,240 --> 02:25:46,240
Dip it, dip it low.

1942
02:25:46,240 --> 02:25:47,240
I like my gallows.

1943
02:25:47,240 --> 02:25:53,560
Vic Reeves with Dizzy, Mile with Drop the Pressure, Daniel Bedingfield with Friday,

1944
02:25:53,560 --> 02:25:55,880
and Carl Douglas with Kung Fu Fighting.

1945
02:25:55,880 --> 02:25:56,880
Yes.

1946
02:25:56,880 --> 02:25:59,400
And then they've got some more here.

1947
02:25:59,400 --> 02:26:05,240
Looks like in the demo or the preliminary song list they mentioned these words, Natasha

1948
02:26:05,240 --> 02:26:09,360
Bedingfield, Michael, Franz Bernett, in the middle Sugar Babes, Goody Two Shoes, Adam

1949
02:26:09,360 --> 02:26:23,360
My question about You Sexy Thing, is it that song they always hear in the commercial, you sexy, sexy thing, you sexy, because that would be horrible.

1950
02:26:39,360 --> 02:26:43,360
So, that's what we've got there. Yeah.

1951
02:26:43,360 --> 02:26:46,360
All right. Sounds good. Thank you for that update on what's going on over there.

1952
02:26:46,360 --> 02:26:49,360
Oh, and of course, you know, Dancing Stage Mario Mix is coming.

1953
02:26:49,360 --> 02:26:52,360
Yeah, you know, DDR with Mario is a game we haven't really talked about a whole lot lately.

1954
02:26:52,360 --> 02:26:58,360
I know it came out in Japan to this big...not...the DDR fans, anyway, in America, really.

1955
02:26:58,360 --> 02:27:03,360
You know, people usually import their DDRs from Japan, but I haven't really heard of anybody importing Mario.

1956
02:27:03,360 --> 02:27:07,360
So nobody's really been going crazy over it. How do you think that game's going to do over here?

1957
02:27:07,360 --> 02:27:11,360
I haven't really heard a lot of buzz about this game.

1958
02:27:11,360 --> 02:27:12,360
I don't know.

1959
02:27:12,360 --> 02:27:18,360
And GameCube's a sinking ship right now, especially after...

1960
02:27:18,360 --> 02:27:22,360
Please Nintendo fanboys, don't start flaming me because I love Nintendo dearly.

1961
02:27:22,360 --> 02:27:24,360
I love Nintendo.

1962
02:27:24,360 --> 02:27:26,360
But they fucked up that Zelda thing.

1963
02:27:26,360 --> 02:27:29,360
Come on, pushing back Zelda to 2006, come on.

1964
02:27:29,360 --> 02:27:30,360
It was pretty dumb.

1965
02:27:30,360 --> 02:27:31,360
They fucked that up.

1966
02:27:31,360 --> 02:27:35,360
So a lot of people are just like done with Nintendo for right now.

1967
02:27:35,360 --> 02:27:50,360
In fact, if you're running, if you look at the poll right now going on at orangeonsrader.com, I don't think the Nintendo screwed up result is winning, but a significant amount of people have been answering that, that way, so it's kind of, um, I don't know, interesting.

1968
02:27:50,360 --> 02:27:52,360
Yeah.

1969
02:27:52,360 --> 02:28:01,360
I don't know. Uh, really, you know, speaking on the rental side of things, nobody carries the GameCube anymore. Nobody.

1970
02:28:01,360 --> 02:28:13,360
The stuff they release for it, it's really kid-based games like Mario Superstar Baseball or Mario Strikers, which is coming out because everybody loves soccer or football, however you want to call it.

1971
02:28:13,360 --> 02:28:17,360
But, um, just, I don't know.

1972
02:28:17,360 --> 02:28:25,360
Of course, I've got the mandatory, fuck you, Sky, you hate Nintendo and I hate you, coming from the chatroom. I don't hate Nintendo.

1973
02:28:25,360 --> 02:28:28,840
I have not stopped playing Meteos for, like, the past two months.

1974
02:28:28,840 --> 02:28:33,760
I have... I have a huge... I'm squeening like a little girl over Nintendogs, which is coming

1975
02:28:33,760 --> 02:28:34,640
out Tuesday.

1976
02:28:34,640 --> 02:28:38,840
I don't even freaking like dogs that much. I've never owned a dog in my life. The only

1977
02:28:38,840 --> 02:28:43,540
dog I ever liked was my grandma's Dash Hunt. But I am buying Nintendogs because I'll be

1978
02:28:43,540 --> 02:28:47,400
damned if that wasn't the cutest game I've seen in, like, five years. So don't tell me

1979
02:28:47,400 --> 02:28:51,160
I hate Nintendo. I love Nintendo. They just... they really fucked up Zelda. They really,

1980
02:28:51,160 --> 02:28:52,200
really fucked that up.

1981
02:28:52,200 --> 02:29:12,200
Really? And, uh, this whole thing with the revolution, we still haven't heard shit about it, and they're even talking about me releasing it the fall of 2006. Wow, that's not gonna fucking suck. Unless it's, like, super revolutionary, which I highly doubt that. But we'll see.

1982
02:29:12,200 --> 02:29:16,480
Who wants to see the

1983
02:29:16,480 --> 02:29:20,000
winner of tonight's cage match? You want to know tonight's weiner

1984
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:23,080
for the tonight's cage match? He's not the only other person in here.

1985
02:29:23,080 --> 02:29:26,240
There were a freaking ton of votes in tonight's cage match.

1986
02:29:26,240 --> 02:29:31,920
Ton of votes. Not a single vote for DJ Sammy, which pisses me the fuck off.

1987
02:29:31,920 --> 02:29:35,680
So next week you are getting another

1988
02:29:35,680 --> 02:29:39,120
booty song. You're getting something along the lines of Camel Toe

1989
02:29:39,120 --> 02:29:42,600
or what was another booty song I put in? Milkshake?

1990
02:29:42,600 --> 02:29:48,060
Milkshake? Put it in my mouth? All those songs I've put in KJ Smash 4, you're getting another one of those next week

1991
02:29:48,060 --> 02:29:51,540
because I'm pissed off that not a single person voted for DJ Sammy.

1992
02:29:51,540 --> 02:29:57,540
Suck it. So anyway, it came down to the other two songs. It was actually very, very close.

1993
02:29:57,540 --> 02:30:01,220
A lot of votes, but a couple votes did sway it

1994
02:30:01,220 --> 02:30:04,620
towards a two-week win

1995
02:30:04,620 --> 02:30:07,980
for Cold Storage with Onyx.

1996
02:30:07,980 --> 02:30:10,980
I should put my backup songs in more often.

1997
02:30:10,980 --> 02:30:13,980
Two weeks winning their cold storage with Onyx.

1998
02:30:13,980 --> 02:30:16,980
Congratulations, Loki, you bastard.

1999
02:30:16,980 --> 02:30:19,980
I don't have to pick a song next week. That's reward enough for me.

2000
02:30:19,980 --> 02:30:22,980
So next week you get a booty song from me because I'm pissed.

2001
02:30:22,980 --> 02:30:27,980
And I'm sure DarkSakura's not happy either, so she'll dig into her archives of...

2002
02:30:27,980 --> 02:30:31,980
...nerd music and find something.

2003
02:30:31,980 --> 02:30:34,980
How else do you explain MC Chris? That's his nerd music.

2004
02:30:34,980 --> 02:30:42,980
Nobody else gets MC Chris, but nerds. So, I'm calling her music nerd music, but with love and respect, of course.

2005
02:30:43,980 --> 02:30:53,980
Alright. Anyway, we're going to get into the FUs of the week. It's that time of the show where we get a little bit angsty, and we do the FUs of the week.

2006
02:30:53,980 --> 02:30:59,980
of the week. So, this is the part where I would usually ask DarkStalker, why is it that

2007
02:30:59,980 --> 02:31:04,460
we do the FUs every single week? And typically she would give us an answer, something along

2008
02:31:04,460 --> 02:31:19,460
the lines of grr, argh. Alright, as a reminder boys and girls, if you have an FU of the week

2009
02:31:19,460 --> 02:31:27,260
want to send in, you can submit us an F.U. by joining our chat room, www.orangeloungeradio.com,

2010
02:31:27,260 --> 02:31:32,980
and clicking on chat, and you can send me a private message, and we will read your F.U.s,

2011
02:31:32,980 --> 02:31:37,860
but may I take this opportunity, since Jamie isn't here to fill this space right now, to

2012
02:31:37,860 --> 02:31:39,380
give you guys some reminders.

2013
02:31:39,380 --> 02:31:45,680
We do not give F.U.s of a personal nature, unless it's like mom, dad, because we've all

2014
02:31:45,680 --> 02:31:46,720
been angsty teens.

2015
02:31:46,720 --> 02:31:54,720
We do those, and if it's somebody we don't know, but if you're flaming somebody in the community specifically, we usually don't like that unless it's like Jack Thompson or something.

2016
02:31:54,720 --> 02:31:55,720
Or me.

2017
02:31:55,720 --> 02:31:57,720
We all hate him. Or Loki. We let you flame Loki.

2018
02:31:57,720 --> 02:32:02,720
But we don't like to flame people that aren't here to defend themselves, so those are always off limits.

2019
02:32:03,720 --> 02:32:09,720
And, uh, no racist FUs, unless they're really funny.

2020
02:32:10,720 --> 02:32:13,720
Because that's the only time we'll let them in, is if they're really funny.

2021
02:32:13,720 --> 02:32:19,720
Alright, let's see, actually I have a private message from DarkSakura, so maybe she does have some FUs.

2022
02:32:19,720 --> 02:32:22,720
Here we go, she would like to say, Fuck my hip hurting!

2023
02:32:22,720 --> 02:32:27,720
And fuck the speed limit, which I broke by at least 20 miles.

2024
02:32:27,720 --> 02:32:31,720
And fuck not buying a Duo RX.

2025
02:32:31,720 --> 02:32:34,720
So those are DarkSakura's FUs of the week. I think she's still typing.

2026
02:32:34,720 --> 02:32:36,720
Oh no, here's another one.

2027
02:32:36,720 --> 02:32:40,720
And lastly, I'm waiting for this, DarkSakura's last FU.

2028
02:32:40,720 --> 02:32:47,720
FU did the internet being slow, and FU did the big buffer, the 30 seconds between when we talk and when you guys actually hear it.

2029
02:32:47,720 --> 02:32:53,720
We're waiting. Oh, she's typing a big, long sentence here because it's taken a while to get it.

2030
02:32:53,720 --> 02:32:56,720
We'll just enjoy the Silent Hill 2 music here for a little bit.

2031
02:33:00,720 --> 02:33:05,720
Ah, here it is. Fuck being jacked up on Vicodin and unable to drive.

2032
02:33:05,720 --> 02:33:10,720
And Dark Sakura? Yes, the Coleco emulator was on the DS.

2033
02:33:10,720 --> 02:33:11,720
It was alright.

2034
02:33:11,720 --> 02:33:14,720
Now it's time for Loki's FUs!

2035
02:33:16,720 --> 02:33:19,720
You know, I really have one that sticks pretty strong with me.

2036
02:33:19,720 --> 02:33:24,720
Um, there was this fucking white trash, I don't even know what you would call them,

2037
02:33:24,720 --> 02:33:28,720
driving this piece of shit car that was smoking like L.A., you know?

2038
02:33:28,720 --> 02:33:33,720
Just driving down the street, nearly trying to hit my car as he's weaving through traffic.

2039
02:33:33,720 --> 02:33:37,940
And then the fucker stops in the middle of the fucking road just stops

2040
02:33:38,640 --> 02:33:40,640
So I'm sitting there going

2041
02:33:40,940 --> 02:33:42,840
Because the fucking they flips me off

2042
02:33:42,840 --> 02:33:49,160
So then he finally turns the you know pulls over and then I flip him off and honk my horn in make you know

2043
02:33:49,860 --> 02:33:56,500
You know comments like fucking get off the road you piece of shit, you know stuff like that our listeners speakers. Thank you for that

2044
02:33:57,460 --> 02:34:00,900
Well, they had to you have to understand that I was yelling very loud

2045
02:34:00,900 --> 02:34:09,900
So, y'know, I was trying to convey that, because I said, y'know, I yelled, y'know, you fucking piece of shit, it doesn't quite, y'know, the same effect.

2046
02:34:09,900 --> 02:34:24,900
Anyways, um, and then fuck you too, the fact that I've still got drive, I have my fiance around everywhere, because that kinda sucks, and um, I still need a picture of me doing this show for a stupid magazine thing.

2047
02:34:24,900 --> 02:34:25,900
I found all my batteries, I can take a picture.

2048
02:34:25,900 --> 02:34:26,900
Okay, cool!

2049
02:34:26,900 --> 02:34:27,900
Yes, alright.

2050
02:34:27,900 --> 02:34:28,900
That's all I have.

2051
02:34:28,900 --> 02:34:29,900
We'll pose pictures later.

2052
02:34:29,900 --> 02:34:33,900
I'm just fucking to Jack Thompson because it's fun to say that.

2053
02:34:34,900 --> 02:34:35,900
Alright.

2054
02:34:37,900 --> 02:34:38,900
My turn.

2055
02:34:43,900 --> 02:34:54,900
I would like to give a big F.U. to getting sick and an F.U. to Southwest Airlines for their little hotbeds of viruses they call airplanes

2056
02:34:54,900 --> 02:34:58,200
and the fact that I caught a sinus infection and F you to the fact that I

2057
02:34:58,200 --> 02:35:00,040
didn't go to the doctor for a few days

2058
02:35:00,040 --> 02:35:04,240
and F you to my allergy to amoxicillin because apparently amoxicillin is the

2059
02:35:04,240 --> 02:35:05,520
best thing to take for this stuff

2060
02:35:05,520 --> 02:35:09,000
but if I take amoxicillin I break out in a big rash and I look like

2061
02:35:09,000 --> 02:35:12,440
freaky rash boy so I can't... Stop laughing!

2062
02:35:12,440 --> 02:35:17,320
Why are you laughing at that? Why do you show up at the next DDR tournament as freaky rash boy?

2063
02:35:17,320 --> 02:35:20,440
No, because they say if I do that too much I might die so I can't take

2064
02:35:20,440 --> 02:35:24,560
penicillin like ever. Okay, a really good tournament then.

2065
02:35:24,560 --> 02:35:32,860
Anyway, so, an F.U. to the nasal spray I have being a brand copay because brands are more

2066
02:35:32,860 --> 02:35:34,200
expensive than generics.

2067
02:35:34,200 --> 02:35:38,160
And that's it, that's all my F.U.s of the week, I'm really not that angry, because I've

2068
02:35:38,160 --> 02:35:40,260
been sick all week, I haven't had time to get angry.

2069
02:35:40,260 --> 02:35:42,260
So we're gonna go to Justin!

2070
02:35:42,260 --> 02:35:46,620
Hello, uh, hmm, what can I say, oh yeah!

2071
02:35:46,620 --> 02:35:51,380
My F.U.s are kinda tied in to Jamie's oddly, uh, F.U. to my hip hurting, because I have

2072
02:35:51,380 --> 02:35:55,780
a hit problem and it really has been hurting for like a month now and I don't know what

2073
02:35:55,780 --> 02:36:03,780
to do. Um, and also tied into Jamie F U to female drivers because they keep trying to

2074
02:36:03,780 --> 02:36:09,580
hit me when I'm on the freeway and that's kind of annoying. Now, uh, I can understand

2075
02:36:09,580 --> 02:36:13,980
if you need to get somewhere fast, but don't go in the slow lane, keep in the fast lane

2076
02:36:13,980 --> 02:36:19,580
and stay there please. Had one driving today, doing her hair and makeup while driving. Oh

2077
02:36:19,580 --> 02:36:20,580
Oh my god.

2078
02:36:20,580 --> 02:36:21,580
Fucking suck.

2079
02:36:21,580 --> 02:36:26,380
My friend keeps on, uh, as soon as she's trying to go to school in the morning, she always

2080
02:36:26,380 --> 02:36:31,700
takes like a left turn, and every single day the same woman cuts her off so she can do

2081
02:36:31,700 --> 02:36:33,020
her makeup.

2082
02:36:33,020 --> 02:36:35,100
It's ridiculous.

2083
02:36:35,100 --> 02:36:36,820
And that's about it.

2084
02:36:36,820 --> 02:36:42,540
Oh wow, Mikolatov gets back just in time from Taco Bell to give his FUs the week.

2085
02:36:42,540 --> 02:36:43,900
Okay, I want music.

2086
02:36:43,900 --> 02:36:45,300
This is a music cover.

2087
02:36:45,300 --> 02:36:46,300
This is your music.

2088
02:36:46,300 --> 02:36:47,300
What is it?

2089
02:36:47,300 --> 02:36:48,860
It's Help Me, Dr. Dick by Erotic.

2090
02:36:48,860 --> 02:36:52,220
I used to have, like, an actual almost music that you would play.

2091
02:36:52,220 --> 02:36:53,260
Really? What do you want?

2092
02:36:53,260 --> 02:36:54,560
It was in a karaoke song.

2093
02:36:54,560 --> 02:36:58,860
Oh, put the new one from, um, Happy Sky, the one that's in French.

2094
02:36:58,860 --> 02:37:00,660
Jesus Christ, what's the name of it?

2095
02:37:00,660 --> 02:37:02,460
Or you'll get an F.U.

2096
02:37:02,460 --> 02:37:06,260
Just, like, Tom, Piz, Sport, I don't know how to say it.

2097
02:37:07,060 --> 02:37:10,460
How about you just do your F.U.s and stop fighting like a little bitch?

2098
02:37:10,460 --> 02:37:11,860
Because that's my F.U.

2099
02:37:11,860 --> 02:37:12,760
It's for us.

2100
02:37:12,760 --> 02:37:14,460
Okay, anyway, I don't really care.

2101
02:37:14,460 --> 02:37:15,260
Um...

2102
02:37:15,260 --> 02:37:16,660
Oh, this is Twin Amadeus.

2103
02:37:16,660 --> 02:37:17,460
Sorry.

2104
02:37:17,460 --> 02:37:18,160
Oh, whatever.

2105
02:37:18,160 --> 02:37:21,440
You get this. Deal with it.

2106
02:37:21,440 --> 02:37:25,500
Want to be funny if I don't have any FUs?

2107
02:37:25,500 --> 02:37:31,040
FU to Medios for being way too addictive.

2108
02:37:31,040 --> 02:37:32,560
FU

2109
02:37:32,560 --> 02:37:33,540
to

2110
02:37:33,540 --> 02:37:34,800
pump it up

2111
02:37:34,800 --> 02:37:37,280
for PS2 because

2112
02:37:37,280 --> 02:37:40,720
unlocking songs is way too hard to do on that game.

2113
02:37:40,720 --> 02:37:47,720
FU to work, because I hate you.

2114
02:37:47,720 --> 02:37:50,720
And... that's about it.

2115
02:37:50,720 --> 02:37:52,720
But I have an interesting little story real quick.

2116
02:37:52,720 --> 02:37:55,720
We went to Taco Bell and the guy was there, and he's actually hot.

2117
02:37:55,720 --> 02:37:57,720
The drive-thru guy.

2118
02:37:57,720 --> 02:38:01,720
And his name's on the receipt, but there's five names, so I don't know which one he is.

2119
02:38:01,720 --> 02:38:03,720
He could be Christine.

2120
02:38:05,720 --> 02:38:06,720
Fag.

2121
02:38:06,720 --> 02:38:08,720
Or Oleg, or Freddy, or Tim.

2122
02:38:08,720 --> 02:38:10,720
But probably Christine.

2123
02:38:10,720 --> 02:38:13,720
And F you to MeekleTalk for not offering to pick me up a pizza.

2124
02:38:13,720 --> 02:38:15,720
Because that's the only thing I like at Taco Bell, is Pizza Hut.

2125
02:38:15,720 --> 02:38:18,220
You didn't... You should have said something.

2126
02:38:18,220 --> 02:38:20,220
Nah, I'm just kidding. It's alright.

2127
02:38:20,220 --> 02:38:22,220
Alright.

2128
02:38:22,220 --> 02:38:28,220
Let's go to the next FUs, which will be the ones from our chat room.

2129
02:38:28,220 --> 02:38:30,220
Yay.

2130
02:38:30,220 --> 02:38:31,220
Dark Knight would like to say,

2131
02:38:31,220 --> 02:38:33,220
An FU to gas prices.

2132
02:38:33,220 --> 02:38:35,220
Quote The Dark Knight Nevermore.

2133
02:38:35,220 --> 02:38:39,220
Oh, but FU to work and being broke as hell.

2134
02:38:39,220 --> 02:38:41,220
Misty would like to say,

2135
02:38:41,220 --> 02:38:42,220
A private message to me.

2136
02:38:42,220 --> 02:38:45,220
That wasn't an FU. Sorry guys.

2137
02:38:45,220 --> 02:38:46,620
Oh wait, no, there it is. I'm sorry.

2138
02:38:46,620 --> 02:38:49,820
I didn't recognize it because it didn't start with FU2.

2139
02:38:49,820 --> 02:38:50,420
It says,

2140
02:38:50,420 --> 02:38:55,720
You people should be lucky that I'm not so angsty because I went to Six Flags today.

2141
02:38:55,720 --> 02:38:59,820
FU to the max too at Six Flags having dusty ass pads.

2142
02:38:59,820 --> 02:39:06,520
Thank Leetness I managed to own a minute with 29 greats and one miss in sandals even.

2143
02:39:06,520 --> 02:39:07,120
Breenie says,

2144
02:39:07,120 --> 02:39:09,120
An FU to learning to drive.

2145
02:39:09,120 --> 02:39:15,120
Enough said. An FU to all the IRC chat users who want us to stop advertising that one channel.

2146
02:39:15,120 --> 02:39:22,120
it

2147
02:39:22,120 --> 02:39:26,760
with acknowledging it which channel take every inside joke from the past five

2148
02:39:26,760 --> 02:39:29,640
episodes of orders on radio combine it in the one name and that's the name of

2149
02:39:29,640 --> 02:39:30,680
the channel

2150
02:39:30,680 --> 02:39:31,860
well so

2151
02:39:31,860 --> 02:39:34,520
oregon trail

2152
02:39:34,520 --> 02:39:38,720
asshole what else at all of it

2153
02:39:38,720 --> 02:39:41,960
to mirror and by the way the whole chair of the state at the end of the song but

2154
02:39:41,960 --> 02:39:43,140
you just feel

2155
02:39:43,140 --> 02:39:46,260
Jamiro says, F you to school starting in about three days.

2156
02:39:46,260 --> 02:39:49,300
Oh, and Jack Thompson because MPQ said so.

2157
02:39:49,300 --> 02:39:51,580
And Spider Stomp.

2158
02:39:51,580 --> 02:39:56,120
Sakurina says, F you to myself for whoring old jokes in the chat room.

2159
02:39:56,120 --> 02:39:59,180
And F you to Jack Thompson because MPQ said so.

2160
02:39:59,180 --> 02:40:02,420
And F you to someone for making Sakurina is pissed.

2161
02:40:02,420 --> 02:40:06,580
Oops, I advertised that channel, sorry.

2162
02:40:06,580 --> 02:40:08,940
Yay, somebody in the chat room said, I heart this song.

2163
02:40:08,940 --> 02:40:10,740
I heart it too, thank you.

2164
02:40:10,740 --> 02:40:36,740
Alright, lesson to Zaku says, F you to this being my last week at home before having to move back to campus next Sunday, F you to being broke and being jobless for almost nine months, F you to not having enough time to hang out with other fellow DDR players every time I go to Chinatown Fair, a DDR in the Groove 2 arcade in Chinatown in New York City, and F you to having to wear a retainer after my braces were removed last week. They hurt like hell and I can't speak in them clearly. In them.

2165
02:40:40,740 --> 02:40:48,420
Kuwabara says, F you to Noria for making such a sexy video to Sylvia Drive, I can't pass

2166
02:40:48,420 --> 02:40:51,580
the fucking song.

2167
02:40:51,580 --> 02:40:56,380
Goggle says, not Google, but Goggle says, I would like to say F you to US News college

2168
02:40:56,380 --> 02:40:57,380
rankings.

2169
02:40:57,380 --> 02:41:00,900
They really don't mean anything, but all the overachieving, pushy parents flock to the

2170
02:41:00,900 --> 02:41:05,300
top ones and crowd up the tours so I can't hear anything.

2171
02:41:05,300 --> 02:41:08,380
Tomokun would like to say, fuck starting school soon.

2172
02:41:08,380 --> 02:41:11,880
People I don't know taking pictures of me playing Para Para dancing

2173
02:41:11,880 --> 02:41:14,220
and fuck a certain thread in the Midwest forum.

2174
02:41:14,220 --> 02:41:16,900
Fuck fuck!

2175
02:41:16,900 --> 02:41:19,420
Dark Knight wants to give one more FU.

2176
02:41:19,420 --> 02:41:24,300
Oh, and a major FU to some local buttwads that go nuts when they have a laptop sale

2177
02:41:24,300 --> 02:41:25,980
on an old-ass school

2178
02:41:25,980 --> 02:41:30,500
uses iBooks because of this many people got hurt by the idiots.

2179
02:41:30,500 --> 02:41:36,220
I heard about the iBook stampede. It's crazy, there was only an iBook stamp for $50.

2180
02:41:36,220 --> 02:41:41,100
and I giggled. You would. By the way, I haven't heard anyone use the term

2181
02:41:41,100 --> 02:41:44,100
buttwads in like years.

2182
02:41:44,100 --> 02:41:51,180
That's great. Thank you. Ask Orange Lounge when we come back from this quick break

2183
02:41:51,180 --> 02:41:54,740
featuring more Erotic. No, just kidding, cause I'll get beat up if we actually do that.

2184
02:41:54,740 --> 02:41:58,260
I already played Erotic. Erotic fans, I already played it this show.

2185
02:41:58,260 --> 02:42:02,340
How about something with Tar Freaks? I like guitar freaks. Guitar freaks is cool.

2186
02:42:02,340 --> 02:42:06,180
So we're gonna do some of that and when we come back we will

2187
02:42:06,180 --> 02:42:09,000
we'll do some Ask Orange Lounge. We're just going to do a couple songs here. We'll start

2188
02:42:09,000 --> 02:42:12,680

2189
02:42:12,680 --> 02:42:19,680
to Ask Orange Lounge. Send in your questions right now.

2190
02:43:42,680 --> 02:44:02,440
Don't you know, don't you know I've been waiting for you

2191
02:44:02,440 --> 02:44:05,560
Don't you know baby you'll just turn up right all the time

2192
02:44:05,560 --> 02:44:09,880
Can't you see, can't you see I've been waiting for you

2193
02:44:09,880 --> 02:44:15,380
See, baby, you just might have lied all the time

2194
02:44:20,880 --> 02:44:23,880
So now with thunder, I wasn't free

2195
02:44:24,380 --> 02:44:27,380
All I wanted was attention

2196
02:44:27,880 --> 02:44:30,880
Party after party, beauty and money

2197
02:44:31,380 --> 02:44:33,880
We were so desperate for perfection

2198
02:44:34,380 --> 02:44:37,380
But you have made me feel so good

2199
02:44:37,380 --> 02:44:41,480
As if I could be closer to you

2200
02:44:41,480 --> 02:44:43,460
I close my eyes

2201
02:44:43,460 --> 02:44:46,980
In your arms like it's never okay

2202
02:44:46,980 --> 02:44:48,260
With...you

2203
02:44:48,260 --> 02:44:50,020
Don't you know, don't you know

2204
02:44:50,020 --> 02:44:51,740
I've been waiting for you

2205
02:44:51,740 --> 02:44:53,160
Don't you know, baby

2206
02:44:53,160 --> 02:44:55,340
You're just gonna crime on time

2207
02:44:55,340 --> 02:44:57,080
Can't you see, can't you see

2208
02:44:57,080 --> 02:44:58,860
I've been waiting for you

2209
02:44:58,860 --> 02:45:00,220
Can't you see, baby

2210
02:45:00,220 --> 02:45:02,340
You're just gonna crime on time

2211
02:45:02,340 --> 02:45:04,040
Don't you know, don't you know

2212
02:45:04,040 --> 02:45:05,860
I've been waiting for you

2213
02:45:05,860 --> 02:45:09,360
Don't you know, baby, you should start off right on time

2214
02:45:09,360 --> 02:45:12,860
Can't you see, can't you see, I've been waiting for you

2215
02:45:12,860 --> 02:45:18,860
Can't you see, baby, you should start off right on time

2216
02:45:18,860 --> 02:45:37,220
Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song, Orange Lounge Radio.

2217
02:45:37,220 --> 02:45:39,500
Alright, you know what time it is, kids.

2218
02:45:39,500 --> 02:45:40,500
Time for the next segment.

2219
02:45:40,500 --> 02:45:48,560
Let's bring it on.

2220
02:45:48,560 --> 02:45:51,920
Let's ask OrangeLounge some stupid question.

2221
02:45:51,920 --> 02:45:55,600
What will we find out this week on OrangeLounge Radio?

2222
02:45:55,600 --> 02:46:01,140
One thing I will tell you, even though nobody asked, is that now Miklotov made this room

2223
02:46:01,140 --> 02:46:03,040
smell like Taco Bell.

2224
02:46:03,040 --> 02:46:09,040
Thanks a lot for that, because Taco Bell makes me sick.

2225
02:46:09,040 --> 02:46:10,040
You're welcome.

2226
02:46:10,040 --> 02:46:12,040
All right.

2227
02:46:12,040 --> 02:46:16,920
Participating in tonight's Ask OrangeLounge, myself, Loki, and Miklotov, everybody else

2228
02:46:16,920 --> 02:46:21,820
left the room for better things I guess. Alright, we're going to start off with Tomo Koon who

2229
02:46:21,820 --> 02:46:27,600
has a question. Do you have any high school freshman tips? Lame question, lolololol. High

2230
02:46:27,600 --> 02:46:31,100
school freshman. God, that was, I don't even want to think about how long ago that was

2231
02:46:31,100 --> 02:46:36,140
for me. It dates me very badly. Wow. Um. High school freshman. You know, just make sure

2232
02:46:36,140 --> 02:46:39,580
you don't fuck up and go to the wrong classes. That's pretty much, I was always worried about

2233
02:46:39,580 --> 02:46:44,460
coming to the wrong classes. Get your schedule, you know, ahead of time. Just, you know, because

2234
02:46:44,460 --> 02:46:49,140
In my situation where I had it was, my junior high split up into two different high schools,

2235
02:46:49,140 --> 02:46:52,740
so some of my friends weren't there and some of them were new, so, you know, find your

2236
02:46:52,740 --> 02:46:59,980
friends, um, just, you know, it's not gonna be that much different than junior high, really.

2237
02:46:59,980 --> 02:47:04,460
And don't, who cares a shit about the upperclassmen, because if they're still picking on you, that's

2238
02:47:04,460 --> 02:47:05,460
retarded.

2239
02:47:05,460 --> 02:47:10,160
Yeah, the upperclassmen hazing thing is so, like, 1970, because every school now has the

2240
02:47:10,160 --> 02:47:14,100
anti-hazing rules, so it's nothing, even when I went to high school, which was quite some

2241
02:47:14,100 --> 02:47:21,100
time ago. They didn't have a problem with that. So, you know what? Just be yourself.

2242
02:47:21,860 --> 02:47:27,020
Don't try to be something you're not. I wish I could tell every high schooler in the world

2243
02:47:27,020 --> 02:47:30,540
that, just be yourself and who cares what other people think. Who cares?

2244
02:47:30,540 --> 02:47:35,940
And really, when you think about it now, when you get out of high school and stuff, you

2245
02:47:35,940 --> 02:47:40,540
look back on it and you're just like, who cares? You know, like, if people didn't like

2246
02:47:40,540 --> 02:47:44,260
you for some reason you don't care all you all you look back on is the things

2247
02:47:44,260 --> 02:47:48,060
that you didn't do that you wish you had that's basically it okay to completely

2248
02:47:48,060 --> 02:47:52,940
countered cutter you know belittle everything they just said establish your

2249
02:47:52,940 --> 02:47:59,500
popularity right away I'm serious it really helps no just I mean yeah be

2250
02:47:59,500 --> 02:48:04,500
yourself and all that but find a cool group to hang with and don't say

2251
02:48:04,500 --> 02:48:08,300
anything stupid and seriously don't give a shit what anybody thinks of you

2252
02:48:08,300 --> 02:48:11,300
because there will be people that will make fun of you.

2253
02:48:11,300 --> 02:48:15,300
Who cares? When it comes to college,

2254
02:48:15,300 --> 02:48:18,800
they're gonna be junkies anyway, so just don't pay them any attention.

2255
02:48:18,800 --> 02:48:22,600
It just makes your high school experience better, yeah. It doesn't matter in the long run, but

2256
02:48:22,600 --> 02:48:26,360
I don't know. The only people you can make fun of are the stupid people.

2257
02:48:26,360 --> 02:48:29,980
Not the retarded people, because they can't help it, but stupid people. Every click

2258
02:48:29,980 --> 02:48:31,240
serves its purpose.

2259
02:48:31,240 --> 02:48:34,760
We gotta move on. We got a ton of questions tonight. I begged twice and I got like

2260
02:48:34,760 --> 02:48:45,760
My question is someone to please describe Quest Mode in UltraMix 3 if they've played it at E3.

2261
02:48:45,760 --> 02:48:49,760
Shane probably can't really say anything about Quest Mode.

2262
02:48:49,760 --> 02:48:51,760
Super deformed characters.

2263
02:48:51,760 --> 02:48:53,760
Yeah, the characters are like the giant heads.

2264
02:48:53,760 --> 02:48:58,760
Basically you move across the capitals of the United States starting in Sacramento.

2265
02:48:58,760 --> 02:48:59,760
Thank you very much.

2266
02:48:59,760 --> 02:49:07,760
I think it costs points to move around the map and you earn points by playing the song in the city.

2267
02:49:07,760 --> 02:49:11,760
Was it like a challenge that you had to do or something?

2268
02:49:11,760 --> 02:49:13,760
Hey, guess what? Quest mode kind of changed since E3.

2269
02:49:13,760 --> 02:49:16,760
Did it? Can you tell us anything new about it?

2270
02:49:16,760 --> 02:49:21,760
No, you can continue though because it follows the same basic principle you're talking about.

2271
02:49:21,760 --> 02:49:26,760
So you earn points by playing the song in the city and then you can move around the map.

2272
02:49:26,760 --> 02:49:28,760
Can you pick up more players as you go?

2273
02:49:28,760 --> 02:49:34,760
I think so, yeah. Pick up more players. I'm assuming that this is going to be how a shitload of things unlock in Ultimix 3, or however many.

2274
02:49:34,760 --> 02:49:42,760
I think the goal is to ultimately conquer all 50 states. Or maybe it's just 48 continental, I don't know.

2275
02:49:42,760 --> 02:49:44,760
That's where you're wrong.

2276
02:49:44,760 --> 02:49:45,760
Oh, really?

2277
02:49:45,760 --> 02:49:46,760
It's around the world.

2278
02:49:46,760 --> 02:49:48,760
That's where you're wrong.

2279
02:49:48,760 --> 02:49:51,760
Canada? Mexico? Oh god, do you have to go to Mexico?

2280
02:49:51,760 --> 02:49:52,760
I hope not.

2281
02:49:52,760 --> 02:49:54,760
I think I'll play DDR in Mexico. It's pumping up there.

2282
02:49:54,760 --> 02:49:56,760
Yeah, it actually is.

2283
02:49:56,760 --> 02:50:05,760
Alright, let's see. So you can't tell us anything about what might have changed? Not anything?

2284
02:50:05,760 --> 02:50:12,760
I really can't. It's just, it's not that big a difference, but there are some subtle changes to it.

2285
02:50:12,760 --> 02:50:16,760
Alright, we'll see. Alright, Rini also wants to know...

2286
02:50:16,760 --> 02:50:17,760
Oh, you will see.

2287
02:50:17,760 --> 02:50:23,760
Rini wants to know, oh, and when are you guys going to do some online UltraMix 2 tournament?

2288
02:50:23,760 --> 02:50:33,760
Um, that's a good idea. Sometime before Ultimix 3, um, in the next couple months when we stop being lazy, we're trying to plan a real DDR tournament, um, and I'm trying to go to the tournament, um, back east as well.

2289
02:50:33,760 --> 02:50:43,760
Um, it shouldn't be that hard. We'll maybe start a forum, or a thread in the forums and see if there's enough interest in it, because last time we tried to do it, like, nobody wanted to play.

2290
02:50:43,760 --> 02:50:46,760
So, we will see.

2291
02:50:46,760 --> 02:50:50,760
Um, we'll post a thread in the forums and see what we get out of that.

2292
02:50:50,760 --> 02:50:54,760
Sakurino wants to know, what is the official release date for Extreme 2?

2293
02:50:54,760 --> 02:50:58,440
I'll field that one.

2294
02:50:58,440 --> 02:51:02,280
It's September, I want to say

2295
02:51:02,280 --> 02:51:06,280
27th. That might be the 26th.

2296
02:51:06,280 --> 02:51:09,280
I know it's the last week of September.

2297
02:51:09,280 --> 02:51:13,840
Sakurino also wants to know, does Konami of America plan on releasing Dancing Stage

2298
02:51:13,840 --> 02:51:15,920
featuring System of a Down anytime soon?

2299
02:51:15,920 --> 02:51:19,240
I will go ahead and answer that question. No.

2300
02:51:19,240 --> 02:51:22,240
I'll answer it too. No.

2301
02:51:49,240 --> 02:51:56,240
Anyways, it's like they knew I'd like the game later and killed it off just to get me even more pissed when they started attacking in the groove.

2302
02:51:56,240 --> 02:52:02,240
It's the same reason why Billy Ray Cyrus doesn't make any more music. It's because it's not popular anymore.

2303
02:52:02,240 --> 02:52:09,240
Even though there's a lot of sarcasm there, there is some truth. From what I understand, Para Para kinda went downhill in Japan for a little while.

2304
02:52:09,240 --> 02:52:11,240
Yeah, it was a fad. That's all it was.

2305
02:52:11,240 --> 02:52:18,240
But it seems like it's still going on. I mean, you still see Eurobeats big with Initial D and stuff. I have a hard time believing it's dead altogether.

2306
02:52:18,240 --> 02:52:26,200
dead altogether. So, I guess here it is. Why did Keyboard Mania stop? Why did Dance Maniac

2307
02:52:26,200 --> 02:52:30,800
stop? Why did any of those great Bomani series that we don't come to love until long after

2308
02:52:30,800 --> 02:52:35,840
they stopped stop because they didn't make enough money? They didn't sell enough machines?

2309
02:52:35,840 --> 02:52:40,800
The end. That's the reason. Infer what you want about the culture and the pop thing.

2310
02:52:40,800 --> 02:52:45,680
If it didn't make money, that's why it didn't continue. But then again, DDR was making

2311
02:52:45,680 --> 02:52:54,680
No money, but whatever. Whatever. We could argue about that until we're blue in the face.

2312
02:52:54,680 --> 02:52:59,680
Legend of Zaku says, hmm, I wonder what surprises wait for us on the song list for Ultra Mix 3.

2313
02:52:59,680 --> 02:53:01,680
Well, if we told you Zaku, they wouldn't be a surprise.

2314
02:53:01,680 --> 02:53:06,680
Also, is it just me, or is My My My from EX2 a damn good song to freestyle to?

2315
02:53:06,680 --> 02:53:09,680
I'm white, therefore I can't freestyle.

2316
02:53:09,680 --> 02:53:12,680
It's just a good song. It's one of my favorites, that's for sure.

2317
02:53:12,680 --> 02:53:14,680
The background cracks me up, too.

2318
02:53:14,680 --> 02:53:23,680
Initial D? Okay, Jamie's yelling at me in the chatroom because she's saying Initial D is old. Yes, but there's that new movie, right? Isn't that movie that just came out new?

2319
02:53:23,680 --> 02:53:25,680
I think so. Yeah, it's pretty new.

2320
02:53:25,680 --> 02:53:28,680
It's still a thing. It's still its thing.

2321
02:53:28,680 --> 02:53:36,680
It's still doing well over here, too. I mean, because obviously, unless you import the fan subs or whatever, you know.

2322
02:53:36,680 --> 02:53:43,680
Legend of Zaku said this one's for Miklatov. Will Quest Mode make stops at New York City or the East Coast?

2323
02:53:43,680 --> 02:53:47,680
He can't really answer questions about Quest Mode because he's under NDA.

2324
02:53:47,680 --> 02:53:52,680
I will answer it, though. From what I saw at E3, it looks like you were stopping in the capital of every state.

2325
02:53:52,680 --> 02:53:55,680
So you wouldn't stop in New York City, but Albany.

2326
02:53:55,680 --> 02:53:58,680
Ooh, somebody knows their capital.

2327
02:53:58,680 --> 02:54:01,680
Right, I do. I know my Animaniacs song.

2328
02:54:01,680 --> 02:54:10,680
That is the city on the East Coast. All the East Coast cities, I'm assuming from the E3, because Shane can't clarify one way or the other, are represented somehow.

2329
02:54:11,680 --> 02:54:16,680
And that's the challenging part. So the East Coast will be the challenging part, because it's all the way on the other side from where you start.

2330
02:54:19,680 --> 02:54:22,680
DarkSakura says,

2331
02:54:22,680 --> 02:54:27,780
Why the fuck does Southern Style iced tea taste so heavenly?

2332
02:54:27,780 --> 02:54:31,980
I don't know. You know what? I was gonna have iced tea at a Cracker Barrel, which

2333
02:54:31,980 --> 02:54:34,060
is as close to Southern Style as I'll get,

2334
02:54:34,060 --> 02:54:37,100
but I didn't get the chance to do that while I was

2335
02:54:37,100 --> 02:54:41,700
visiting the East Coast. I have a question for her. Why aren't you here supporting

2336
02:54:41,700 --> 02:54:42,900
Pump It Up?

2337
02:54:42,900 --> 02:54:46,660
She can't because of her... she was at Classic Gimmi Expo and she hurt her hip.

2338
02:54:46,660 --> 02:54:49,780
Yeah, but you know what? And she was partially turned into an evil warlord.

2339
02:54:49,780 --> 02:54:56,780
That was really cool. She was already an evil warlord. That is going in the next intro, that's for sure.

2340
02:54:56,780 --> 02:54:59,340
Smack Man would like to know,

2341
02:54:59,340 --> 02:55:02,320
why do only the crappy songs

2342
02:55:02,320 --> 02:55:05,140
get stuck in your head?

2343
02:55:05,140 --> 02:55:07,840
Because you listen to bad music.

2344
02:55:07,840 --> 02:55:12,100
That's a very good question. It's just Murphy's Law that bad songs are going to get stuck in your head.

2345
02:55:12,100 --> 02:55:17,100
And I don't know, you know, it's just a fact of life, so I leave you with this.

2346
02:55:21,100 --> 02:55:23,100
This is a good song!

2347
02:55:27,100 --> 02:55:30,100
Enjoy, courtesy of Orange Lawn's Radio.

2348
02:55:32,100 --> 02:55:34,100
Uhh, Spirit Snare.

2349
02:55:35,100 --> 02:55:39,100
Question, do you get to kill Naoki as an extra stage in quest mode?

2350
02:55:39,100 --> 02:55:41,100
I will answer that question, no you do not.

2351
02:55:41,100 --> 02:55:47,100
I don't work for Konami, and I haven't seen the game outside of E3, but I just know the answer is no, I'm sorry to say.

2352
02:55:47,100 --> 02:55:51,100
But it changed since E3.

2353
02:55:51,100 --> 02:55:55,100
Let's see.

2354
02:55:55,100 --> 02:56:00,100
Addendum. Do you get to kill Jack Thompson as a one more extra stage in quest mode?

2355
02:56:00,100 --> 02:56:03,100
I will also answer that question. No, you do not. Sorry to say.

2356
02:56:03,100 --> 02:56:07,100
And, Konami, could you confirm that? Our Konami rep?

2357
02:56:07,100 --> 02:56:27,100
I hate him as much as you guys do, but he provides entertainment for the morning every day for me because he always says something new and stupid, so I don't want him dead. I don't want him to shut up. So please quit trying to kill him.

2358
02:56:27,100 --> 02:56:32,100
Guys, there's plenty more games for him to be angry over, you know, come fall.

2359
02:56:32,100 --> 02:56:38,100
Yeah, so, I mean, we've just hit the tip of the iceberg. It's gonna get a lot better, I'm sure.

2360
02:56:38,100 --> 02:56:43,100
I don't know, when Titanic hit the tip of the iceberg, it didn't get much better.

2361
02:56:46,100 --> 02:56:49,100
It's almost like the living room had heard that joke.

2362
02:56:51,100 --> 02:56:54,100
God, sometimes I wish we were a TV show, seriously.

2363
02:56:56,100 --> 02:57:00,100
Anyway, we gotta start wrapping up the show. However, there's one more question,

2364
02:57:00,100 --> 02:57:10,100
Why doesn't Konami bring back Hold Notes and Scratches in Beatmania 2DX?

2365
02:57:30,100 --> 02:57:34,100
In Five Key, they did like a hold note where you would have to consistently turn the note.

2366
02:57:34,100 --> 02:57:38,100
Oh, I thought that was a freestyle note. I thought I was just like scratching randomly.

2367
02:57:38,100 --> 02:57:39,100
You know, I would...

2368
02:57:39,100 --> 02:57:41,100
No wonder I didn't do it right, I guess.

2369
02:57:41,100 --> 02:57:44,100
You know what, Rene? This is what I would have to say to that.

2370
02:57:44,100 --> 02:57:47,100
As far as Konami of Japan, I couldn't tell you, but look at this.

2371
02:57:47,100 --> 02:57:51,100
Beatmania Five Key songs are making its way into the U.S.

2372
02:57:51,100 --> 02:57:56,100
And you can already see the Konami U.S. is doing its own thing with Beatmania.

2373
02:57:56,100 --> 02:57:59,820
beat mania like they have the balls to change the interface for one to a new

2374
02:57:59,820 --> 02:58:00,540
color

2375
02:58:00,540 --> 02:58:02,540
granted it's just a new color but it's

2376
02:58:02,540 --> 02:58:03,620
something

2377
02:58:03,620 --> 02:58:06,080
uh... also happy sky difficulty names

2378
02:58:06,080 --> 02:58:10,340
yes and rumor is that uh... the controllers are to be different knows

2379
02:58:10,340 --> 02:58:14,920
it's like a rumor you know it's confirmed it in a there in an interview

2380
02:58:14,920 --> 02:58:15,800
on like

2381
02:58:15,800 --> 02:58:17,640
i think game spot

2382
02:58:17,640 --> 02:58:21,660
they have the rounded edges and they address the button though super thought

2383
02:58:21,660 --> 02:58:22,980
that was

2384
02:58:22,980 --> 02:58:23,820
something that

2385
02:58:23,820 --> 02:58:35,820
And also, I'm hoping that they bring actual hold keys, for example, like in Keyboard Mania or in Easy To DJ. That would be awesome if they implemented that later on.

2386
02:58:35,820 --> 02:58:49,820
So I would say probably not this mix, but they're going to want to have things later on that kind of make their mixes like, ooh, it's the new thing in this mix. Don't count it out for the U.S. mixes. I would say don't count it out for the U.S. later mixes.

2387
02:58:49,820 --> 02:58:55,820
So long as you guys support it and buy it, because I mean, if it tanks, we'll fawn you.

2388
02:58:55,820 --> 02:58:58,820
I'm at least buying a controller to replace my old one.

2389
02:58:58,820 --> 02:59:02,820
Because I'm excited about the idea of the new controller, so we'll see.

2390
02:59:02,820 --> 02:59:05,820
Alright, it's time to wrap up tonight's show. We're going to go around and get everybody...

2391
02:59:05,820 --> 02:59:09,820
Oh, I'm sorry, we have one more question. I totally skipped Tomo-kun's second question.

2392
02:59:09,820 --> 02:59:14,820
Why is it that the Dirty Sex Line commercials show up on broadcast airwaves at night?

2393
02:59:14,820 --> 02:59:16,820
What's wrong with having them during the day?

2394
02:59:16,820 --> 02:59:24,820
Because six-year-old children who don't know any better would call them, who are channel surfing because their parents leave the televisions to babysit them.

2395
02:59:24,820 --> 02:59:26,820
And then blame TV.

2396
02:59:26,820 --> 02:59:27,820
Yep.

2397
02:59:27,820 --> 02:59:34,820
All right, that's going to do it for tonight's episode of Orange Lounge Radio. Thank you guys so much for tuning in and listening to and supporting us, we appreciate it.

2398
02:59:34,820 --> 02:59:39,820
Don't forget, we also have a live show on Tuesday night that's Pump Up the Volume with the one and only Dark Sakura.

2399
02:59:39,820 --> 02:59:44,080
And I will be bringing a show back very soon. I know I've said that for like the past seven weeks

2400
02:59:44,080 --> 02:59:48,300
But I got very sick this week. So that's why I didn't do it. But maybe this next week and

2401
02:59:49,100 --> 02:59:51,500
You know more exciting stuff coming to Orange Lounge radio

2402
02:59:52,580 --> 02:59:55,100
also the podcast you got we have

2403
02:59:55,900 --> 03:00:00,380
An unbelievable amount of listeners on the podcast. Thank you guys so much for your support of podcasts. It's crazy

2404
03:00:00,500 --> 03:00:04,700
We're also working on something for those PSP owners out there. Oh, that's gonna be great

2405
03:00:04,700 --> 03:00:07,700
So we're hoping to have a breakthrough on that being the first

2406
03:00:07,700 --> 03:00:12,500
first online station to have something like that. So we'll see. Anyway, thank you guys

2407
03:00:12,500 --> 03:00:17,420
for your support. We appreciate you. Love you. Final thought time. Miklotov, thanks

2408
03:00:17,420 --> 03:00:22,700
for coming in tonight and telling us nothing about DDR, but giving us some good hints about

2409
03:00:22,700 --> 03:00:28,500
Pump It Up. That's good. Hey, it wasn't a hint, it was facts. I know. Any final thoughts?

2410
03:00:28,500 --> 03:00:35,600
I have two. One, I ate too much Taco Bell, now my stomach hurts. And two, does anybody

2411
03:00:35,600 --> 03:00:39,600
How do you want to go to work for me tomorrow? Because I don't.

2412
03:00:39,600 --> 03:00:41,600
Loki, your final thought.

2413
03:00:41,600 --> 03:00:46,600
I've got to bring over next week the iToy, because I have...

2414
03:00:46,600 --> 03:00:52,600
Well, and the microphone, because I have SingStar Pop, that one we've got to try out.

2415
03:00:52,600 --> 03:00:53,600
Yeah, I want to see that.

2416
03:00:53,600 --> 03:01:01,600
And then I also have iToy Harry Potter, iToy Sega, and iToy Play, and I think I'm going to try to get Play 2 as well.

2417
03:01:01,600 --> 03:01:12,600
Even though Dark Sakura, I think, called it a bastardization of the original Samba de Amigo, I really want to play the Itoi Samba, because I didn't get to play it at E3.

2418
03:01:12,600 --> 03:01:17,600
So, I don't want to misquote her. She might not have said that, but I'm pretty sure she didn't say the best thing about it.

2419
03:01:17,600 --> 03:01:20,600
So, she'll be here to talk about that next week. She'll be back next week.

2420
03:01:20,600 --> 03:01:30,100
But, um, there's that, and then, um, I've got an actual, um, another import I gotta try. It's another street racing game, so we're, like, initial D.

2421
03:01:30,100 --> 03:01:41,600
They need to put, um, what was it, um, Midnight Tune on their Wang Dang's Maxi- Midnight Maximum Tune on the console systems, cause that'd be awesome. That game's actually pretty cool.

2422
03:01:41,600 --> 03:01:56,600
Alrighty, and I would just like to say thank you guys very much for listening, and I hope I feel better next week, and I'm just looking forward to getting in some major gaming this next week with my brand new PlayStation.

2423
03:01:56,600 --> 03:02:03,600
And on behalf of DarkSakura, I'd like to say reject false icons, because you know that's her thing, that's what she'd say if she were here.

2424
03:02:03,600 --> 03:02:09,600
And, um, that's it, the final word of the show, one word to sum it all up, the one and only Miek Letov.

2425
03:02:11,600 --> 03:02:13,600
What?

2426
03:02:14,600 --> 03:02:19,600
That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.

2427
03:02:19,600 --> 03:02:24,600

And now, here is your fortune cookie message of the day.

2430
03:02:42,600 --> 03:02:47,600
Hello, boys and girls. This is your old pal, Stinky Wizzleteeth.

2431
03:02:48,600 --> 03:02:51,600
This is a song about a player. No!

2432
03:02:52,600 --> 03:02:56,600
This is a song about being happy. That's right!

2433
03:02:56,600 --> 03:03:00,060
It's a happy, happy, joy, joy song.

2434
03:03:00,060 --> 03:03:06,020
Happy, happy, joy, joy, happy, happy, joy, joy.

2435
03:03:06,020 --> 03:03:09,640
Happy, happy, joy, joy, happy, happy, joy, joy.

2436
03:03:09,640 --> 03:03:13,380
Happy, happy, joy, joy, happy, happy, joy, joy.

2437
03:03:13,380 --> 03:03:15,060
Happy, happy, joy, joy, joy.

2438
03:03:15,060 --> 03:03:16,640
Happy, happy, joy, joy, joy.

2439
03:03:16,640 --> 03:03:18,560
I don't think you're happy enough.

2440
03:03:18,560 --> 03:03:19,720
That's right.

2441
03:03:19,720 --> 03:03:22,260
I'll teach you to be happy.

2442
03:03:22,260 --> 03:03:26,040
I'll teach your grandmother to suck eggs.

2443
03:03:26,040 --> 03:03:28,040
Let's try it again.

2444
03:03:29,040 --> 03:03:42,040
Happy, happy Joy Joy! Happy, happy Joy joy! Happy, happy Joy joy!

2445
03:03:43,040 --> 03:03:45,040
If you knew ain't the grand daddy of all liars.

2446
03:03:46,040 --> 03:03:48,040
The little critters of nature.

2447
03:03:48,040 --> 03:03:50,040
They don't know that they're ugly.

2448
03:03:51,040 --> 03:03:52,040
That's very funny.

2449
03:03:52,040 --> 03:03:55,860
That's very funny. A fly marrying a bumblebee?

2450
03:03:56,600 --> 03:03:59,540
I told you I'd shoot, but you didn't believe me.

2451
03:03:59,840 --> 03:04:01,740
Why didn't you believe me?

2452
03:04:03,600 --> 03:04:06,940
Happy, happy, yoy, joy, happy, happy, yoy, joy

2453
03:04:06,940 --> 03:04:10,200
Happy, happy, yoy, joy, happy, happy, yoy

2454
03:04:10,200 --> 03:04:13,400

2456
03:04:20,400 --> 03:04:32,640
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.

2457
03:04:50,400 --> 03:05:00,080
And fade to black, that's the end of the show.

2458
03:05:00,080 --> 03:05:06,200
Now we're going to go to our Bomani music and video game music program right after switching

2459
03:05:06,200 --> 03:05:07,200
the stream over.

2460
03:05:07,200 --> 03:05:10,240
So that means you guys are going to get booted from the stream, but please reconnect in about

2461
03:05:10,240 --> 03:05:16,880
30 seconds to resume hearing all your favorite DDR, 2DX, and video game favorite music.

2462
03:05:16,880 --> 03:05:19,400
And yeah, please reconnect, and don't forget our podcast.

2463
03:05:19,400 --> 03:05:22,120
We're going to go tape that right now, and that will be up Monday morning.

2464
03:05:22,120 --> 03:05:23,120
So see you guys later.

2465
03:05:23,120 --> 03:05:24,060
Thanks for tuning in tonight.
