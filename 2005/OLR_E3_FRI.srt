You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your podcast home for all the

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
latest video game news and gamer chat.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Logan.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Alright, here we are back with our final day here at E3, and I don't know if my co-hosts

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
My co-hosts are feeling it like I am, but I think I'm ready for this show to be about over by now.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
My co-hosts, Loki, the one and only.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Hi.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And also, Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I need a new body.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So what do you think? Are you ready for this show to be over, or what, Loki?

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm more than ready, and it's over.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Yay.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Dark Sakura.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,240
No, I could go five more days in E3, like they do at Anime Expo, they add another day

17
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:06,100
every year, and then you do nothing but see video games, and, uh, oh yeah, sure.

18
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:10,460
Now for those people at home that are probably yelling at us, going, dude, I would kill to

19
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:15,820
be at E3 for anything, and you guys are bitching about having to be there for three whole days,

20
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:16,820
what would you say?

21
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:18,740
Why is it that you kinda get burned out on E3?

22
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:19,740
Okay, how about this?

23
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:20,740
Why are you feeling it?

24
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:21,740
I'll tell you what.

25
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:24,860
Let's say you're on the East Coast, start walking to E3.

26
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:29,500
Once you get there, now you know what it's like to be there for three days.

27
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:35,260
Your feet hurt like a bitch, and you're bored out of your mind, and you're thinking, why?

28
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:36,260
Why is it three days long?

29
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:37,260
No, I don't know.

30
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:42,260
Actually, it's just you walk around pretty much everything, and you've already seen everything.

31
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:49,420
Unless you're in meetings all the time, like we aren't, you really see pretty much everything

32
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:50,420
in about two days.

33
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,420
I don't know.

34
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,780
I found more stuff today.

35
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,380
Actually, I made today my standing in line day

36
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:59,420
so I got in to see the

37
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:04,720
Something I'm going to talk about momentarily on the show and I went into the SEGA theater again

38
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08,580
I'm gonna talk about that later, but I got to get in and see things and I got into

39
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:11,620
running into people who can

40
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:14,020
things I

41
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,780
Think somebody summed it up best. I remember who said this

42
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:21,160
I want to say it was Mel B that told me this something about the first day

43
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:24,760
You're just overwhelmed and you want to take everything in the second day

44
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,880
You know where you want to go?

45
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,880
You know what boost you want to do the third day?

46
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,480
You've seen it all and you're just kind of winding down

47
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,720
So I think that about sums it up for me

48
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,800
But I know a lot of us got to do some cool things on this third day

49
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,360
So I would you typically do the three things but well, I won't put a cap on it today

50
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,000
Let's just say share things with our audience that you think was cool today. We'll start off with dark soccer essence

51
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I know she's got at least two things right there. I

52
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,120
I went into the Sega theater today, got to see the new Sonic game that they're doing.

53
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,160
I believe it's for the Xbox 360.

54
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,200
It's pretty damn good looking, and it was a real-time demo.

55
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:06,440
So he was playing it, one of the developers there was playing it as they were doing it.

56
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:13,840
There's that serial killer game, Conspiracy, I think that's what it's called, Condemned.

57
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,840
I know it was a con something.

58
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:20,540
see my brains fries the end of the con the kid down that was pretty spooky but

59
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:25,300
it seems sorta hi I'm a big ugly thing I'm gonna hit you on the head with this

60
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:34,780
hammer BAM L you know that type of game and then there was there's a full auto

61
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:38,620
game now the full auto is pretty cool is sort of like I'm going to run into this

62
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:43,580
building wait no I don't want to do that rewind called the unrack and then drive

63
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:48,820
forward keep going that was pretty cool and also met somebody his name was Eric

64
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:54,660
if he's listening I introduced him to the show so hi in fact to all of the

65
00:03:54,660 --> 00:04:00,580
people who I have met at the convention if you're listening to us hi I also met

66
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:07,700
one of Jason's friends randomly sitting on the floor at squenix but I'll go

67
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:10,900
into that later anyway yeah I couldn't get into the

68
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:15,660
They were out of tickets by the time I got up there, which was shitty.

69
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:21,660
So I trotted on over, and I tried to peek at the Activision stuff, I was like, eh, so

70
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,400
I kept going.

71
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:29,140
Made it over to where the PS3 line was.

72
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:32,580
And for being wrapped around the building, the wait was not as long as I thought it was

73
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:36,280
going to be there, saying, this is a three hour wait, but I got up there in 25 minutes

74
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:39,760
and I was at the tail end.

75
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:44,220
They did some type of HDTV demo thing, and then they actually let you take you into another

76
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:50,980
theater where you can sit for a little bit, and they showed what the system can do.

77
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:51,980
It's rad.

78
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:55,380
They built a city there on screen.

79
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:58,120
They also showed some of the games that are currently in development.

80
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:03,660
They didn't list names of the games, but some of us could tell one of them was a new Tekken.

81
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:08,600
They showed Jin up there with sweat coming out of his body, and this apparently is done

82
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:13,760
in-game engine one that looked like one of the romance of the three kingdoms

83
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:20,080
games some type of off-road game this was a very destructive off-road game

84
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,120
like it shows this one scene with a motorbike guy getting back up on his

85
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:29,200
bike with a car about to land on him after an explosion it was pretty pretty

86
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:36,080
intense I got out I see the P of the ps3 took pictures of the ps3 which will be

87
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:43,240
on OrangeChallengeRadio.com. The other cool thing is that I played more

88
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:49,640
Nintendogs. I played Romancing Saga and actually I got into H-Tech. That was

89
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:55,640
pretty cool. Got to play a new game for anyone who is an anime fan or big

90
00:05:55,640 --> 00:06:02,480
importer of RPGs. Coming out on the PSP, I do believe he said Winter, is Popokoros,

91
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:09,920
which has been a pretty big series it's a 2d RPG it is the first true RPG for

92
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:14,880
the system to be released in the States so be on the lookout for that and also

93
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:22,400
got to see formula front armored core that was pretty cool working on right

94
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,520
now is a wild arms ultra F which has actually been delayed by about five

95
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:35,020
months but it gives them time to tweak the translation also RPG maker 3 now

96
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:39,260
that I have to say I was very impressed with the last RPG maker you know I was

97
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:41,860
kind of into that I was into the first one because I was one of those people

98
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:45,660
that was petitioning for it to get off the Super Famicom and get over the US

99
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:52,540
this one was pretty pretty awesome I mean it's not like you're playing you

100
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:55,580
know this little ghetto game that you just piece together with duct tape this

101
00:06:55,580 --> 00:07:01,120
This is fully rendered because you can paint your textures onto mountains.

102
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,480
You choose what style your sprites are going to look like.

103
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:09,440
You can choose, you know how in RPGs it has a picture of your character over the text

104
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,440
box.

105
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,560
You can do conversation characters and have them in an anime style or you can have them

106
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,440
in a conventional, you know, American style.

107
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,180
It's pretty cool.

108
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,180
Is it?

109
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:21,080
Now, there was a game maker that was supposed to be coming out on the PSP.

110
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,080
Is this the game maker that's on the PSP?

111
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,080
This is on PS2.

112
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,080
Now, PS2.

113
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:29,680
There's one coming out for the PSP, and there's so many things they could do for this,

114
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,840
but I know they're not gonna, because they just don't think ahead.

115
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:39,720
But, like, for example, the PSP, you could have it where you could upload your own pictures or something like that

116
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:44,800
from the internet, or your own music, or something. You make your own game and then distribute that game over the internet.

117
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,960
That would be cool.

118
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,440
Of course, you know, they're not going to think of that.

119
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:52,040
think of that they don't they might have thought of it but it might take money

120
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:58,000
out of their pocket all right Loki what kind of stuff did you look at today I

121
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:06,600
looked at a few things I went back for a second peek at what was that that one

122
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:12,560
erotic whatever feel three feels every next game the dominant I had to show

123
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:20,480
that to Jason today apparently there's peripherals for this game sex

124
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:25,640
peripherals for this game I'll leave it at that use your imagination boys

125
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:33,840
basically folks this is the definition of cyber sex the res vibration machine

126
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:39,160
to shame oh this is a device that vibrates that's not gonna be confused

127
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:42,600
with a trans vibrator, this is a vibrator.

128
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,640
Let's just let the audience use their imagination

129
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,480
on that one, shall we?

130
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,760
It's very phallic.

131
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:50,760
Anyways, so yeah, that's interesting.

132
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,420
I'll have to check out the website later.

133
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:56,600
And then, I like how it's like, it's kind of weird.

134
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,440
Yeah, I'll check it later.

135
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,840
I have to check it out.

136
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,180
You have to research it on behalf of our listeners,

137
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:04,160
of course, not that you have any interest in this.

138
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,120
You're just doing it as a favor to the listeners, right?

139
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,600
I honestly don't want to buy this.

140
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:13,080
This is one of those games that's going to be weird because, you know, I can't go about

141
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:16,040
normal methods of distribution for this game.

142
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,040
So, whatever.

143
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:23,920
But anyways, I got to finally, finally play In the Groove today on Rockstar's new...

144
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,720
Yes, which is interesting because they weren't showing the game on Wednesday when we went

145
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,320
by the booth the first time, but today they actually showed the game.

146
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:39,040
In The Groove, and I got to test out Red Octane's new pads, they're the metal ones, and I have

147
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,120
to say they both disappoint me very much.

148
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:46,000
And guess what, I still have the same opinion about In The Groove, it's still a knockoff

149
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,480
of DDR and it's gonna be treated as such in my mind.

150
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:56,560
Those new pads, they look pretty solid, but they've got a few fatal flaws in them, one

151
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,360
One of them being that the arrows are recessed too far, and it feels really awkward playing

152
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,840
on them, and I didn't like them one bit.

153
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,320
I don't know, it might be a personal opinion thing, because when I played them a couple

154
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,960
weeks ago, they were great to me.

155
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,960
I really enjoyed them.

156
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,960
I don't know.

157
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:12,200
All they gotta do to fix it, raise up those arrows just, you know, just a teeny little

158
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:16,760
bit, you know, just a few millimeters just to make it, you know, just set in a little

159
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,000
bit, not too much, don't go crazy.

160
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,280
And then, instead of making them all rubbery, make them metal.

161
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:26,000
But then you played two other DDR mats as well, right?

162
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,120
Yeah, and then that one starts to look pretty good when you look at the other two, right?

163
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:36,080
Okay, the second one was DDRgame.com, their metal pad with their bar.

164
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,080
Which had a bar, yeah.

165
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,080
Which had a bar, yeah.

166
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,360
Yeah, the pad sucked.

167
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:45,160
Okay, those pads, they were all shiny and it basically had soft pad syndrome where you

168
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,160
can't tell where the hell the arrows are.

169
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:53,600
what's worse about the DDR game.com ones if you miss the pad you're gonna like

170
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,140
hurt your your leg because it's raised up which happened to somebody we know

171
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:02,500
actually yeah happened to someone and so I I cannot recommend those but it's the

172
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:06,180
only one you're gonna see that has like the solo arrows actually on it although

173
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:11,900
most now you know they did do something kind of neat and I'll give them credit

174
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:15,420
for this cuz I mean soft pads they're pretty much all the same out there but

175
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:19,060
They actually had a doubles soft pad, which I thought was pretty cool.

176
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:23,420
The only thing I could see that would suck about that is if one side breaks down.

177
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:24,420
Oh crap.

178
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:25,420
You're st...

179
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:26,420
Anyways.

180
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:28,900
So yeah, I tried that one, that was pretty cool.

181
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:34,780
And really, I don't know, DDR pads, they're just all about the same.

182
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:38,300
Then what else did I get to try out today?

183
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:41,680
I watched Kingdom Hearts 2, that looked pretty cool.

184
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:46,560
And then, really, it's just a lot of hanging around Konami's booth, checking that stuff

185
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:52,380
out, and talking to some of the people, trying to get, not necessarily press kits, but on

186
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:55,540
their email list for my work, and that kind of thing.

187
00:11:55,540 --> 00:12:01,420
And I have to say that the people at EA can suck it, because they have this, we're better

188
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:06,780
than everyone else attitude, and they've done that to our company as a whole.

189
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:10,080
When our company, yeah, we're distributing games, they're like, yeah, we don't care.

190
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:15,040
just like big deal you know you know the hell with them and it seems like you

191
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,680
know honestly from hearing other people's they have anything at their

192
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:24,000
booth that interested any of us they had their new drive most wanted I was

193
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,760
looking at the stuff for the Sims Sims 2 for PSP is pretty cool that was

194
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:33,320
interesting and oh I didn't waiting lines had I known that the ps3 line was

195
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:37,480
gonna be so short I would have waited for that but whatever but the ps3 line

196
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:41,440
was next to the Zelda line and both of them went about the same distance back

197
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,180
and the Zelda line was three hour away because I guess they weren't taking in

198
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:50,080
as many people at a time or something so yeah it was kind of a misconception at

199
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:54,320
least I I certainly thought that PlayStation would it would be one I'd be

200
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,860
waiting long or just as long in as Zelda but the interesting thing is that the

201
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,860
Zelda line ran out of shirts today so some people that didn't went through the

202
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:04,840
whole thing didn't even get a shirt I did get the plane in ten dogs and that

203
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:08,940
game is so damn yeah I've got to get that game I very knew I was gonna buy

204
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:14,020
the game before you know I actually played it but it's just it's such a game

205
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:18,400
I don't even know this is gonna honestly people are gonna play this game and it's

206
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:22,120
gonna be just like Animal Crossing where you just can't get enough of it you're

207
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:25,040
just gonna be playing at all time you're gonna be worrying about your pets are

208
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,120
not getting walked or something when you're out like I think it is gonna be

209
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:32,720
like the next Tamagotchi now don't shun it just just because I say it that way

210
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:39,760
but I think it's gonna be something that appeals to a more broader age range

211
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:44,000
yeah just the whole trade everything now now Jamie bring just brought up

212
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,360
something to me I forgot to ask her how was the boomerang on the ps3 what was

213
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,240
your impressions of the boomerang I'm looking at my picture of it right now

214
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:58,880
I'm trying to imagine how this thing would feel in my hand now for those that

215
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,140
are a little bit lost the boomerang is what we are calling the controller on

216
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:06,780
the ps3 because it looks like well a boomerang it does it looks like a half

217
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:10,300
you know what it looks like it looks like an old-school Microsoft Sidewinder

218
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:18,340
yeah guess what folks I don't honestly stick with dual shock that's what I say

219
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:24,580
yeah I couldn't just it didn't seem like it would be all that comfortable but I

220
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:29,740
don't know and it's only conceptual it said concept controller so maybe they'll

221
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:33,980
make some changes and make it less boomerangy I don't know stuff I checked

222
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:39,060
out today I actually got to play a little bit of Kingdom Hearts 2 and very

223
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:43,460
interesting I have to admit I wasn't so into the first one I know a lot of

224
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:46,820
people consider to be this great game and I I respect the game but I couldn't

225
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:51,100
get into it because I got really really bothered by the camera like that whole

226
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:55,660
3d thing that can annoy me on some of those games and I didn't have the same

227
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:58,500
problems and Kingdom Hearts 2 it looks like they went back and fix some of that

228
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:04,360
and they added a couple new modes to like they have this overdrive mode like you might think of this from Final Fantasies kind of

229
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,960
Similar but more towards the Kingdom Hearts concept or if you build up enough strength

230
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:11,220
You can go into overdrive mode and you transform and you have two blades

231
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:14,160
So that's kind of neat but it was kind of interesting because I had two different

232
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,360
Representatives from Square Enix pointed out to me. Did you know about overdrive mode? Did you try it?

233
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:22,560
Did you try it like I guess it's the big selling point of the game or something. I don't know but um

234
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,320
The levels I play were kind of cool. They had the Mulan and the

235
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:32,120
Hercules level playable so I'm kind of neat um yeah did you actually of course

236
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:36,760
you had our on there did you get the fusions no I did not get a chance to do

237
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:41,800
the fusion with goofy the best of the Valor one that's awesome he dual wields

238
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,760
kill the key blades yeah having our on in the game was kind of neat though I

239
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,680
gotta say that's kind of neat addition to the game another game I checked out

240
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:52,400
today was Hello Kitty roller rescue now stop laughing stop laughing I was drawn

241
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:56,000
of this game because I love Batsumaru the penguin and I saw that he was in the game

242
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,040
so I had to check it out. Hello Kitty Roller Rescue is very interesting. I'm sure there's

243
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:06,820
an audience out there for it somewhere. Even though I do love Batsumaru I can't personally

244
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:11,160
say I would buy this game. I would buy it for a child but I don't know if I could buy

245
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:15,960
it for myself. I became too frustrated because Hello Kitty would not jump over everything.

246
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:19,960
There was only certain things like some weird collision detection. I don't know what it

247
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:25,920
is but just it wasn't as interactive as it just felt weird I but a kid would be

248
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:30,200
into it a kid wouldn't be bothered by it so and that's what it was really for so

249
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:35,200
that was one of the other games I saw today I guess that's all I really want

250
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,440
to say oh one other game I actually saw this yesterday but I forgot to bring it

251
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,960
up on yesterday's show the Capcom collection that has a bunch of old

252
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:46,000
school Capcom arcade games ghouls and ghosts super goals and ghosts and the

253
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,600
one I played 1943 all in it kind of a neat collection seems like the kind of

254
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:54,160
the popular trend right now with the retro and is having the flashback

255
00:16:54,160 --> 00:17:00,080
console Atari having the Capcom collection the Namco one they're doing a

256
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:04,120
new one that's really big very interesting trend did you get to play

257
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:09,760
any final fight I did not play final fight it's very wonky right now it was

258
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:14,160
pretty good new final fight okay yeah I actually played the new romancing saga

259
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:20,720
I was never big into the saga games. It was kind of cool, but it looks like a freaking ps1 game

260
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,120
It's just not clean. Yeah, saga sagas were games

261
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:33,220
All right, okay now since the show is all done I'd like us to go around and think about the best

262
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:39,880
Let's do best booth at the show first the best booth who there at the show

263
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:47,660
Do you believe had the best booth out of anybody and why anybody want to start it's kind of dark Sakura

264
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,660
There's things that

265
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:54,340
Places that did things better. I think but overall I have to give

266
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:00,000
It's actually a toss-up it really is a toss-up. Okay a tie. What do you think?

267
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:08,260
I'm gonna have to say that between Konami and Namco. I mean just Konami went all out with that show

268
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:11,500
That was really cool. You know so as far as their presentation

269
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:18,620
Namco I'm not able to but Konami had the better show, but as far as overall like I said saying yesterday friendliness

270
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:21,020
knowledge

271
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:27,420
You know the fun swag I have to say that Namco really impressed me very much their lineup

272
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,700
I got to play. Oh, I also play pack and roll and

273
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:36,480
When a person when someone came over and saw that I had the the hang of playing it they didn't harass me

274
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:41,740
I just got to play it we talked a little bit about it as the people at Namco mobile were fun

275
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:47,560
They were just happy and that you know, they ran out of the little squishy pac-man things, but they apologized for it

276
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:54,600
And you know, they knew what they were doing. They were happy to do what they were doing our co-host

277
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,360
for

278
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:02,960
Outside the box lanky style. He actually got a short video clip of the Prince of the cosmos

279
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,800
breakdancing

280
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,600
really

281
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,520
Hoping to make a live journal icon out of that

282
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,200
We'll have to post that in our orange lounge live journal community once that's done. Okay, so

283
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,760
dark soccer saying toss-up between Konami and Namco

284
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,760
Loki what do you think was the best booth at the show?

285
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:25,260
Well

286
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:32,300
Man, it's tough. I only I you know, I'm so biased just because I hung out Konami's booth, you know a long time

287
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:35,080
You know pretty much the majority of time while I was there

288
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,720
Only because a few things one

289
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,380
You know the whole stage area right there where they had a DDR games very open

290
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:47,360
You're not really feeling crowded in there plus you can sit down and like watch the little trailer reel that they've got there

291
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,900
Couldn't really do that anywhere else also

292
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:56,160
I guess as far as being the least offensive booth of them all because you know

293
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:01,400
They didn't really have any booth babes jumping around they had you know actually something that appealed everyone

294
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:08,920
that was kind of cool and however there is a close second that would be a game

295
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:12,960
infinity and only because they had X tango in the sex game there three feel

296
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,200
or feel three but those are pretty cool then there were some booths that just

297
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,240
like I was confused on like for example I will do worst booth of the show a

298
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:24,640
little later this isn't worse but this is just confusing I just like huh I

299
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,920
kind of nodded my head I didn't understand it like the booth for the

300
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:32,920
Singles 2 game was Triple Trouble or something like that where there's three

301
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:37,640
chicks in this like roped off area is like a room just sitting there I was

302
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:43,040
like I didn't get it I just didn't get him like and then guys were standing

303
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:48,080
there probably sitting there thinking I wonder if they'll do it you know it's

304
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:54,560
just gonna sell a game whatever I guess I didn't get it probably my second

305
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:57,800
runner-up would be actually the g4 booth because they had a pretty cool setup

306
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:03,640
there as far as like sit down chill watch their shows make a t-shirt which

307
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:07,340
at least you're guaranteed a t-shirt that way they had um you know the people

308
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:12,640
giving out those ouch kits those are pretty awesome free massages and the

309
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,740
eight-foot Nintendo controller plus you get autographs and it was just it was

310
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:21,720
kind of a good vibe there I also have to give a special kudos to the Tylenol ouch

311
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:28,420
booth and the cute guy that gave me a back massage all right I would say if I

312
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:32,340
had to pick one booth of the show and I hate to kind of echo what somebody else

313
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:36,840
already said but honestly for me there was one booth that I feel they put all

314
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:40,620
their cards out on the table everybody there was really friendly I got to play

315
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:44,980
their games they have a hell of a lineup this year and that booth would be Namco

316
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:48,500
I would say would be my booth of the year was I was just blown away about

317
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:51,980
about what they've got to offer I think with between like we heart katamari soul

318
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:58,300
caliber 3 pac-man and even semi-decent mobile games as well and usually I'm not

319
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:01,860
very impressed with cell phone games but the ones I played were pretty decent for

320
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:05,420
a cell phone certainly more so than some of the other ones I played at the show

321
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:09,560
and I just felt that Namco they also had various stage shows going on with the

322
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:13,940
whole soul caliber battles and stuff it really was for me I think the most

323
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:18,460
impressive lineup at the show so that would be my booth as a show alright best

324
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:27,300
you want to do best gamer you into worst booth next worst booth Dark Sakura for

325
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:33,100
attitude it was Capcom bunch of apathetic no you know Capcom is a

326
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:37,680
company has my love you know been long time Capcom fan but the people who they

327
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:43,900
had working the information booth they were just rude rude as they could be

328
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:47,420
yeah we kind of got talked about it yesterday so you guys know how we feel

329
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:52,940
about it. They just displayed so much apathy that I can't say that Capcom really impressed

330
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:57,820
me. They really didn't have a whole lot of games. I mean, and I want to answer an email

331
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:01,220
real quick, because while we're on Capcom, I'm so sorry to interject, but if I don't

332
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:05,100
do it now, I'll forget. Somebody had written us an email about Mega Man Battle Network

333
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:12,820
and wanted to know how it would link up with the other DS Battle Network games. And basically

334
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:16,300
what we found out is that there is some type of tournament mode, so you can play Battle

335
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:19,780
network against the DS wireless but we did not see anything in any of the

336
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:23,300
materials so far I haven't dug through the whole book but in a little promo

337
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,860
video we saw we didn't see anything about it linking up to the Game Boy

338
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:29,900
Advance versions or anything it's just a type of online battle tournament mode

339
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:38,240
anyway I just want to interject that okay it was you know everybody put on a

340
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:43,780
really good display actually Gizmondo was also really excellent for we're

341
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:47,980
I'm using it as a comparison. Because you know Gizmondo was sort of like,

342
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:52,260
eh, we're Gizmondo last year. And this year we're like, hey, we're freaking

343
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:57,220
Gizmondo and we're bringing out people to rap and spin and dance for you and everything.

344
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:03,660
But Capcom was the same as they were last year, just, we don't want to fucking be here.

345
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:08,700
You know, it may be true, it may be work, but you should be happy in the work that you

346
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:11,760
do. And the guys at Namco, they were having to

347
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:17,000
do every bit of a boring job that you were, but they were all smiles and friendly.

348
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,600
So Capcom must be the dullest place on earth to work for or something.

349
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,840
Alright, so is that your worst booth or do you have an overall worst booth?

350
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:29,080
Like I said, the displays and everything were great.

351
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:37,120
For everywhere, there wasn't anything really disappointing as far as their look, but yeah,

352
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,880
I have to say that Capcom, it was just the attitude.

353
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:46,660
attitude soured their whole booth for me all right Loki this one's easy I'd like

354
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:51,080
to give a big thank you to Rockstar for saving me a time for having to play

355
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:56,300
their games because guess what they rented out this huge huge booth and put

356
00:24:56,300 --> 00:25:00,540
some buses there and said hi you don't get to play anything eat that you're

357
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:04,260
gonna buy our games anyways suck it you know and that was it they didn't have

358
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:09,500
Jack they even they had a little brief small little trailer thing and then they

359
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:14,640
were giving out like what a screen cleaner or something the only picture I

360
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:19,400
saw of bully was in a magazine I got there for free so I actually saw more of

361
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:23,880
rock stars line up from some stupid magazine then you know their actual booth

362
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:27,280
you know what I'm tired of these game companies thinking that their stuffs all

363
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:31,800
kick-ass just because you know the last couple games which have all been exactly

364
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:35,960
the same I might add have sold really awesome but guess what you know what

365
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:41,820
save emergency suck balls so you know what I hope bully does too because I'm

366
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:45,180
not giving you my money just for the same damn rehash game with maybe a

367
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:49,180
different genre not necessarily different on a different time period it's

368
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:54,260
set in all right well for my worst booth again I hate to echo what somebody else

369
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:58,860
already said but just because of the fact that it was an eyesore I mean the

370
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:03,620
booth itself was an eyesore and just the fact that they had all this space and

371
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:05,580
and did nothing with it for the fans.

372
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:10,100
Rockstar was by far the worst booth of E3 2005,

373
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:12,180
and it just did not get me excited

374
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,580
about any of their games at all.

375
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:16,180
And granted, I was never huge on Grand Theft Auto

376
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:19,220
to begin with, but I didn't wanna stop and look at anything.

377
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:20,740
And I know they're trying to show new games.

378
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:21,940
I didn't wanna stop and look.

379
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:24,300
A horrible position for them, too.

380
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,220
Their booth was in a bad spot, too.

381
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:28,420
I understand if they wanna do press only for these games,

382
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,100
because obviously they're probably in progress

383
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,460
and they don't want any bad balloons.

384
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:33,540
But even still, last year,

385
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:35,700
Last year, I didn't see their games.

386
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,740
Okay, they were behind closed doors,

387
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:39,500
you can go and make an appointment to play it.

388
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,500
This was just like rubbing it in your face.

389
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,700
It's like, oh, hey, guess what?

390
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:46,400
You can go in here and play games if you're pressed,

391
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,700
and if you make an appointment.

392
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:50,380
And just the chain link fence and the giant buses

393
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:52,020
were just an eyesore.

394
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:53,020
They didn't need to be there.

395
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:53,860
Guess what?

396
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:55,460
With all the other neon nice effects,

397
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:58,820
just to have that ghetto looking booth was just, no.

398
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:01,860
You know what, I honestly, I learned about Rockstar's

399
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:06,020
lineup from posters that were outside on Hollywood Boulevard that's where I

400
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:10,100
learned about their stuff so when I saw their booth with the buses like whoopity

401
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:14,460
freakin doo-dah you know wow you have bully coming out look guess what it's

402
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:19,660
just like Grand Theft Auto but it's in school alright best game of the show best

403
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:23,140
game of the show in your opinion the game that wowed you the most and that

404
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:27,220
you you will just be running out and getting the day it comes out because you

405
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:33,180
were so impressed by it at the show Dark Sakura there are so many good ones

406
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:39,300
making me think I mean seriously it is that difficult to pin down just one it's

407
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:47,480
hard it's hard um I think I'm gonna be running right out after shoot it's like

408
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:52,180
our toss-up between three games seriously name three we love Katamari

409
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:56,180
Definitely. Nintendogs and Animal Crossing DS.

410
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:01,180
I'm not going to go into that.

411
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:05,180
I would have to say those three were the top of the show.

412
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:08,180
Well, actually those three had me convinced to be the top of the show,

413
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:12,180
but actually I think that I'm going to bypass all of them for Popocaros.

414
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:18,180
Because I need an RPG on the PSP, and it's fun, it's cute, it's 2D,

415
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:21,180
so actually I'm going to have that one top them.

416
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:23,180
Alright, Popocaros.

417
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:25,180
Loki, game of the show.

418
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:29,180
I'm gonna get Weheart Katamari, that's for sure.

419
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:31,180
And why is that?

420
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:33,180
It's because it's Katamari, it's just fun.

421
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:34,180
It's also cheap.

422
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:36,180
What does the sequel offer that the first one doesn't though?

423
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:38,180
Why should people run out and get it?

424
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:41,180
It's more of the same game, who cares?

425
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:43,180
That's why you want to get it.

426
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:45,180
Everything you loved about the first game is in the second game,

427
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:47,180
and it's just wackier and better.

428
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:50,180
Let me help. Co-op mode as well, and some new modes as well.

429
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:56,420
Who cares about that? I'm just talking about more game. You know, you finish the first game like I want more give me more

430
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,980
So, you know this this will be cool

431
00:28:58,980 --> 00:28:59,860
then then time

432
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:04,860
Nintendogs will be awesome and I've got to get you know animal crossing just because everyone else is gonna have it, you know

433
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,860
and I don't want to feel left out and

434
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:11,620
Yeah, I think those are probably the ones are you gonna let your puppies play with my puppies?

435
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:14,740
Maybe I'm gonna call my dog bacon

436
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:17,540
All right

437
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:19,800
My game of the show I you know

438
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:25,720
I love games that do something new that isn't just the same old crap over and over again and

439
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,280
Bring something you know new to the table

440
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:35,400
I like interactive games that help you you know do like I loved Animal Crossing 1 because you could interact with other people

441
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:39,440
in unique ways, so I just love originality and

442
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:44,380
And this game was just damn good-looking too, and I had fun with it

443
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:45,400
I had a lot of fun with it

444
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,800
which is something I cannot say about most games.

445
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,560
A game of the show for me would be Nintendogs.

446
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:53,800
Okay, which is odd because I'm totally not a dog person,

447
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:57,200
but I loved Nintendogs, it was so cute.

448
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,040
I'd like to discuss this stuff right here.

449
00:29:59,040 --> 00:29:59,880
Okay.

450
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,560
I pulled open my little show daily magazine here,

451
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,840
and they have won a.com awards

452
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,480
for what they thought were the best.

453
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,360
Sure, sure.

454
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,200
So the game-

455
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,680
Can I finish my thought on guest show stuff first?

456
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,600
Well, I thought you were done.

457
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,440
No, I'm not done.

458
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,640
I have a runner up.

459
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,480
You all got a runner up, I want a runner up.

460
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,480
My runner-up would be actually Meteos, the new puzzle game that's gonna be coming out on DS.

461
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:22,480
I had a lot of fun playing that in the hotel last night because we were able to,

462
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:26,480
myself and my friend were able to download it off the DS download station.

463
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:30,480
And we just had a lot of fun with the versus mode.

464
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,480
I think it's finally like a really good puzzler for the DS.

465
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:39,480
And it's very odd that I'm giving both the best in show, my thoughts, and runner-up to DS games

466
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:42,480
when I've kind of knocked the DS quite a bit over the past few months

467
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:47,520
because they've had really a crap lineup well the DS is it is true the DS is

468
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:53,040
going to get a hell of a lot better over the next nine months and you know if you

469
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:58,760
are in the DS versus PSP mindset I still think both systems are very separate and

470
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:01,720
if you really want to experience everything you're gonna have to own both

471
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:06,240
but it's gonna be a close contest for those looking at one or the other okay

472
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,080
now we can just look at it this way people you're not gonna have to actually

473
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:12,960
get an external keyboard if they put Linux on the DS versus you know the PSP

474
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:18,720
I had a moment of comedy though speaking of the DS stuff was trying to download

475
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:28,680
electroplankton from the PSP area and having a Sony person comment on it huh

476
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:35,120
all right okay yeah Logie you were gonna get into what somebody else their awards

477
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,880
game of the show they gave it to Legend of Zelda I haven't seen the game so yeah

478
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:43,880
I mean to be honest, I think our our awards quote-unquote

479
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:47,960
You have to remember are from our perspective and our perspective was we were

480
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,880
Even though you know, we're borderline media. We went in as non-media just like, you know

481
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:58,960
I just like the salespeople just like the folks the students and the folks that are barely in the industry from our

482
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:02,860
Perspective Legend of Zelda was not easily accessible

483
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:08,840
So therefore it kind of gets a strike against it when it comes to really the most impressive thing at the show exactly

484
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:15,060
best visuals unreal tournament 2007 once again another thing that you had to wait in line to go see yes, uh-huh

485
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:21,120
But it looked good. Anyway, it's best game trailer. I can agree with this Mel your solid for had a learn

486
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,380
Have a funny trailer hilarious trailer for that

487
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:30,400
Best original or most original game electroplankton and I haven't played it so I couldn't tell you I wasn't able to get in on the demo

488
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:36,980
But I know dark soccer you got it. It is it actually is sort of music II but yeah electroplankton is really bizarre

489
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:40,900
I've been wanting that game for what was that one game that we were playing that was on the

490
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:46,780
God the other system the other portable system, you know that you were hyping up

491
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:52,980
Gizmondo. Yes. What was the other that game the guitar guitar game? It was called Johnny Wonder

492
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:57,660
I think it was that was pretty cool. It had a little karaoke mode where you sort of

493
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:05,740
You know hit directions and rhythm and it was like a music and rhythm game meets an action game, which was kind of cool

494
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:10,180
You have like an action mode where you kill things by wailing part on your guitar

495
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:15,360
Anyways next one so one more award, okay

496
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:19,020
How about we do well?

497
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:24,660
Again, this is coming from the showbook. Yeah, I'm one of comms award best show me or

498
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:28,860
Best simulation game than ten dogs without a doubt all right

499
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:33,660
And yeah, you can find all this stuff on one up calm or if you luckily have one of these things

500
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:39,120
There's a game that they listed on here, which is cool best PC games spore, which is by will right which you know

501
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:44,780
It's gonna be pretty good at PC games. I was a little disappointed that I'd really didn't see any civilization for

502
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:50,000
I saw huge banners for it, but no place he could really go look at it

503
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,220
I guess they were doing trailers and teasers

504
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:55,720
But I was really hoping I'd be able to get my hands on it couldn't do it

505
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:59,000
There was a civil a civilization game coming out on engage

506
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:04,840
That I did get a chance to play and the graphics are nice but I couldn't figure

507
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:08,920
out how to move my freaking character and to be honest I'm just done with the

508
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:14,440
Engage. I have no interest in any games coming out. The Engage Arena when I walked by with

509
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:20,880
Jamie it was empty. I went by it towards the beginning of the show totally empty

510
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:26,520
totally empty so it's kind of sad. There was more people inside the Rockstar

511
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:30,840
booth than there were in the engage arena so kind of sad but this happens

512
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:35,400
all right I guess that's it you guys we're pretty much done with the show

513
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:39,840
here at e3 so of course we will be back live Sunday with our three-hour talk

Loki at orange launch radio.com. Yeah, nice. All right

528
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:41,180
Okay, let's go around and give everybody's final thought final e3 thought Loki

529
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:47,560
That pizza I had this morning wasn't cooked all the way and there will be hell to pay hell to pay. I

530
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,920
I

531
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:54,360
Had a bacon covered wiener and it was good and it was cooked in onions

532
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:59,160
So it tasted like a bacon covered onion wiener and reject false icons

533
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:03,520
Yet Loki yes

534
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:10,680
Oh you want me my father my final thought would be that I think it's very ironic that the ferret and the orange lounge

535
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:15,800
Radio media CD ended up within like a foot of each other on the giant katamari

536
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:21,280
Yeah, and I wonder where they're gonna roll that thing. I was just gonna say that the Katamari claimed the ferret. Yes, so

537
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:26,020
It was the retard ferret, right? No, it was the one that made all the cool sounds

538
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,420
Apparently I made a mistake. Well, I took the one that Loki had operated on

539
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:35,160
It wasn't the one you've been using on the shows because that's still in your green chair. So don't don't cry

540
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,360
He's with the king of the cosmos now deal

541
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,480
