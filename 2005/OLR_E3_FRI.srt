[SPEAKER_02]: Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.

3
00:00:20,629 --> 00:00:25,330
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, here we are back with our final day here at E3.

4
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:33,192
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know if my co-hosts are feeling it like I am, but I think I'm ready for this show to be about over by now.

5
00:00:33,932 --> 00:00:34,772
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Rob Roberts.

6
00:00:34,792 --> 00:00:35,792
[SPEAKER_04]: You might know me as Sky.

7
00:00:35,852 --> 00:00:38,493
[SPEAKER_04]: My co-hosts, Loki, the one and only.

8
00:00:38,953 --> 00:00:39,273
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.

9
00:00:39,993 --> 00:00:42,454
[SPEAKER_04]: And also DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

10
00:00:43,854 --> 00:00:44,754
[SPEAKER_01]: I need a new body.

11
00:00:46,074 --> 00:00:46,874
[SPEAKER_04]: So what do you think?

12
00:00:47,155 --> 00:00:49,095
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you ready for this show to be over or what, Loki?

13
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:50,411
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura

14
00:01:06,047 --> 00:01:15,289
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, for those people at home that are probably yelling at us going, Dude, I would kill to be at E3 for anything, and you guys are bitching about having to be there for three whole days.

15
00:01:15,729 --> 00:01:16,289
[SPEAKER_04]: What would you say?

16
00:01:16,369 --> 00:01:18,989
[SPEAKER_04]: Why is it that you kind of get burned out on E3?

17
00:01:19,249 --> 00:01:20,190
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, how about this?

18
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:20,730
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll tell you what.

19
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:22,610
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's say you're on the East Coast.

20
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:24,310
[SPEAKER_03]: Start walking to E3.

21
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:27,791
[SPEAKER_03]: Once you get there, now you know what it's like to be there for three days.

22
00:01:29,431 --> 00:01:33,292
[SPEAKER_03]: Your feet hurt like a bitch, and you're bored out of your mind, and you're thinking...

23
00:01:34,491 --> 00:01:34,912
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

24
00:01:35,192 --> 00:01:36,253
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is it three days long?

25
00:01:36,293 --> 00:01:36,873
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't know.

26
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:42,199
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, it's just you walk around pretty much everything, and you've already seen everything.

27
00:01:42,279 --> 00:01:50,247
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless you're in meetings all the time, like we aren't, you really see pretty much everything in about two days.

28
00:01:52,236 --> 00:01:52,516
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

29
00:01:52,556 --> 00:01:53,537
[SPEAKER_01]: I found more stuff today.

30
00:01:54,157 --> 00:01:56,478
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I made today my standing in line day.

31
00:01:57,419 --> 00:02:02,521
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got in to see something I'm going to talk about momentarily on the show.

32
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:04,242
[SPEAKER_01]: And I went into the Sega Theater.

33
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:05,803
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I'm going to talk about that later.

34
00:02:05,963 --> 00:02:12,746
[SPEAKER_01]: But I got to get in and see things and I got into running into people who get me into other things.

35
00:02:14,432 --> 00:02:15,133
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

36
00:02:31,153 --> 00:02:47,624
[SPEAKER_04]: so I think that about sums it up for me but I know a lot of us got to do some cool things on this third day so I would typically do the three things but well I won't put a cap on it today let's just say share things with our audience that you think was cool today we'll start off with DarkSakura since I know she's got at least two things right there

37
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:53,123
[SPEAKER_01]: I went into the Sega Theater today, got to see the new Sonic game that they're doing.

38
00:02:53,163 --> 00:02:55,264
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it's for the Xbox 360.

39
00:02:56,025 --> 00:02:59,707
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty damn good looking, and it was a real-time demo.

40
00:03:00,148 --> 00:03:04,351
[SPEAKER_01]: So he was playing it, one of the developers there was playing it as they were doing.

41
00:03:04,411 --> 00:03:12,196
[SPEAKER_01]: There's that serial killer game, Conspiracy, I think that's what it's called.

42
00:03:13,317 --> 00:03:14,818
[SPEAKER_01]: Condemned, I knew it was a con something.

43
00:03:14,918 --> 00:03:16,479
[SPEAKER_01]: See, my brain's fried, it's the end of the con.

44
00:03:17,339 --> 00:03:26,167
[SPEAKER_01]: um, The Condemned, that was pretty spooky, but it seemed sort of, hi, I'm a big ugly thing, I'm gonna hit you on the head with this hammer, BAM!

45
00:03:27,648 --> 00:03:27,828
[SPEAKER_01]: Ow.

46
00:03:28,448 --> 00:03:29,249
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that type of game.

47
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:44,081
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, um, there was, uh, there's that Full Auto game, now the Full Auto was pretty cool, it was sort of like, I'm going to run into this building, wait, nope, I didn't want to do that, Rewind, called the Unwreck, and then Drive Forward.

48
00:03:44,662 --> 00:03:46,143
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep going, that was pretty cool, and also, uh,

49
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:47,735
[SPEAKER_01]: Met somebody.

50
00:03:47,775 --> 00:03:48,876
[SPEAKER_01]: His name was Eric.

51
00:03:48,936 --> 00:03:52,318
[SPEAKER_01]: If he's listening, I introduced him to the show, so hi.

52
00:03:52,918 --> 00:03:53,318
[SPEAKER_01]: New person.

53
00:03:53,918 --> 00:03:59,421
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, to all of you people who I have met at the convention, if you're listening to us, hi.

54
00:03:59,441 --> 00:04:01,662
[SPEAKER_01]: I also met one of Jason's friends.

55
00:04:02,903 --> 00:04:03,383
[SPEAKER_01]: Randomly.

56
00:04:04,023 --> 00:04:06,024
[SPEAKER_01]: Sitting on the floor at Squinnix.

57
00:04:06,864 --> 00:04:08,165
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'll go into that later.

58
00:04:09,005 --> 00:04:14,208
[SPEAKER_01]: At any rate, I couldn't get into Squinnix and they were out of tickets by the time I got up there, which was shitty!

59
00:04:15,603 --> 00:04:20,744
[SPEAKER_01]: So I trotted on over and I tried to peek at the Activision stuff.

60
00:04:20,764 --> 00:04:21,405
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, eh.

61
00:04:21,605 --> 00:04:22,165
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kept going.

62
00:04:23,225 --> 00:04:28,126
[SPEAKER_01]: Made it over to where the PS3 line was.

63
00:04:29,027 --> 00:04:32,988
[SPEAKER_01]: And for being wrapped around the building, the wait was not as long as I thought it was going to be.

64
00:04:33,028 --> 00:04:35,028
[SPEAKER_01]: They're saying, this is a three hour wait.

65
00:04:35,088 --> 00:04:37,329
[SPEAKER_01]: I got there in 25 minutes and I was at the tail end.

66
00:04:38,329 --> 00:04:45,813
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they did some type of HDTV demo thing, and then they actually let you take you into another theater where you can sit for a little bit.

67
00:04:46,613 --> 00:04:50,715
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, you, they showed what the system can do.

68
00:04:50,835 --> 00:04:51,736
[SPEAKER_01]: It's rad.

69
00:04:51,756 --> 00:04:53,857
[SPEAKER_01]: They built a city there on screen.

70
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:57,298
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they also showed some of the games that are currently in development.

71
00:04:58,059 --> 00:05:02,541
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't list names of the games, but some of us could tell one of them was a new Tekken.

72
00:05:03,582 --> 00:05:06,926
[SPEAKER_01]: They showed Jin up there with sweat coming out of his body.

73
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:09,310
[SPEAKER_01]: And this apparently is done in-game engine.

74
00:05:11,873 --> 00:05:14,156
[SPEAKER_01]: One that looked like one of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms games.

75
00:05:16,299 --> 00:05:17,520
[SPEAKER_01]: Some type of off-road game.

76
00:05:18,341 --> 00:05:20,162
[SPEAKER_01]: This was a very destructive off-road game.

77
00:05:20,662 --> 00:05:28,385
[SPEAKER_01]: It shows this one scene with a motorbike guy getting back up on his bike with a car about to land on him after an explosion.

78
00:05:28,405 --> 00:05:29,566
[SPEAKER_01]: It was pretty intense.

79
00:05:30,126 --> 00:05:30,646
[SPEAKER_01]: I got out.

80
00:05:31,386 --> 00:05:32,167
[SPEAKER_01]: I see the PS3.

81
00:05:33,827 --> 00:05:39,210
[SPEAKER_01]: took pictures of the PS3, which will be on orangeislandradio.com.

82
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:44,133
[SPEAKER_01]: The other cool thing is that I played more Nintendogs.

83
00:05:44,173 --> 00:05:48,275
[SPEAKER_01]: I played Romancing Saga, and actually I got into H-Tech.

84
00:05:49,324 --> 00:05:50,184
[SPEAKER_01]: That was pretty cool.

85
00:05:50,644 --> 00:05:52,285
[SPEAKER_01]: Got to play a new game.

86
00:05:52,805 --> 00:06:04,929
[SPEAKER_01]: For anyone who is an anime fan or big importer of RPGs, coming out on the PSP, I do believe you said winter, is Popokuros, which has been a pretty big series.

87
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:07,910
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a 2D RPG.

88
00:06:07,991 --> 00:06:12,132
[SPEAKER_01]: It is the first true RPG for the system to be released in the States.

89
00:06:12,961 --> 00:06:14,643
[SPEAKER_01]: So be on the lookout for that.

90
00:06:14,683 --> 00:06:20,008
[SPEAKER_01]: And also got to see Formula Front Armored Core.

91
00:06:20,268 --> 00:06:20,929
[SPEAKER_01]: That was pretty cool.

92
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:30,118
[SPEAKER_01]: Working on right now is Wild Arms Ultra F, which has actually been delayed by about five months, but it gives them time to tweak the translation.

93
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:33,861
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, RPG Maker 3.

94
00:06:34,942 --> 00:06:37,344
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that, I have to say, I was very impressed with.

95
00:06:37,364 --> 00:06:45,270
[SPEAKER_01]: The last RPG Maker, you know, I was kind of into that, and I was into the first one because I was one of those people that was petitioning for it to get off the Super Famicom and get over to the U.S.

96
00:06:46,511 --> 00:06:49,433
[SPEAKER_01]: This one was pretty, pretty awesome.

97
00:06:49,594 --> 00:06:55,038
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's not like you're playing, you know, this little ghetto game that you just piece together with duct tape.

98
00:06:55,478 --> 00:06:57,860
[SPEAKER_01]: This is fully rendered trees.

99
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:00,682
[SPEAKER_01]: You can paint your textures onto mountains and

100
00:07:01,042 --> 00:07:05,244
[SPEAKER_01]: You choose what style your sprites are going to look like.

101
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:09,726
[SPEAKER_01]: You can choose, you know how on RPGs it has a picture of your character over the text box.

102
00:07:10,026 --> 00:07:15,449
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do conversation characters and have them in an anime style or you can have them in a conventional American style.

103
00:07:15,509 --> 00:07:16,029
[SPEAKER_01]: It was pretty cool.

104
00:07:18,096 --> 00:07:20,937
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a game maker that was supposed to be coming out on the PSP.

105
00:07:21,037 --> 00:07:22,317
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this the game maker?

106
00:07:22,537 --> 00:07:24,638
[SPEAKER_03]: This is on PS2.

107
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:34,160
[SPEAKER_03]: There's one coming out for the PSP and there's so many things they could do for this, but I know they're not going to because they just don't think ahead.

108
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:41,421
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, the PSP, you could have it where you could upload your own pictures or something like that from the internet or your own music or something.

109
00:07:41,441 --> 00:07:44,242
[SPEAKER_03]: You make your own game and then distribute that game over the internet.

110
00:07:44,782 --> 00:07:45,402
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be cool.

111
00:07:45,902 --> 00:07:47,582
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, you know, they're not going to think of that.

112
00:07:48,523 --> 00:07:49,143
[SPEAKER_03]: I think of that.

113
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:49,783
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't.

114
00:07:50,123 --> 00:07:52,783
[SPEAKER_01]: They might have thought of it, but it might take money out of their pocket.

115
00:07:55,584 --> 00:07:57,604
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, Loki, what kind of stuff did you look at today?

116
00:07:58,485 --> 00:08:00,825
[SPEAKER_03]: I looked at a few things.

117
00:08:01,305 --> 00:08:05,666
[SPEAKER_03]: I went back for a second peek at... What was that?

118
00:08:05,826 --> 00:08:09,667
[SPEAKER_03]: That one erotic whatever... Feel 3.

119
00:08:09,747 --> 00:08:10,167
[SPEAKER_03]: Feel 3.

120
00:08:10,247 --> 00:08:13,748
[SPEAKER_03]: The cyber sex game that dominated... Yeah, I had to show that to Jason today.

121
00:08:14,648 --> 00:08:15,548
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently, there's...

122
00:08:16,482 --> 00:08:19,465
[SPEAKER_03]: Peripherals for this game.

123
00:08:20,226 --> 00:08:22,228
[SPEAKER_03]: Sex peripherals for this game.

124
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:23,911
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll leave it at that.

125
00:08:24,591 --> 00:08:25,933
[SPEAKER_03]: Use your imagination, boys and girls.

126
00:08:25,953 --> 00:08:30,218
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, folks, this is the definition of cybersex.

127
00:08:30,258 --> 00:08:34,223
[SPEAKER_00]: That puts the Rez vibration machine to shame.

128
00:08:34,543 --> 00:08:40,229
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, this is a device that vibrates that's not going to be confused with a transvibrator.

129
00:08:40,249 --> 00:08:45,353
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just let the audience use their imagination on that one, shall we?

130
00:08:45,393 --> 00:08:46,274
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very phallic.

131
00:08:48,436 --> 00:08:50,438
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, that's interesting.

132
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:53,921
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll have to check out the website later.

133
00:08:54,822 --> 00:08:56,504
[SPEAKER_03]: I like how he's like, it's kind of weird.

134
00:08:56,604 --> 00:08:57,445
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'll check it later.

135
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,301
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to check it out.

136
00:08:59,842 --> 00:09:02,625
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to research it on behalf of our listeners, of course.

137
00:09:02,866 --> 00:09:04,107
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that you have any interest in this.

138
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:06,070
[SPEAKER_04]: You're just doing it in favor of the listeners, right?

139
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,551
[SPEAKER_03]: I honestly don't want to buy this.

140
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:15,532
[SPEAKER_03]: This is one of those games that's going to be weird because, you know, I can't go about normal methods of distribution for this game.

141
00:09:15,992 --> 00:09:16,893
[SPEAKER_03]: So, whatever.

142
00:09:16,913 --> 00:09:30,477
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyways, I got to finally, finally play in the group today on Rockstar's new... Yes, which is interesting because they weren't showing the game on Wednesday when we went by the booth the first time, but today they actually showed the game on PS2.

143
00:09:30,497 --> 00:09:36,479
[SPEAKER_03]: In the group, and I got to test out Red Octane's new pads.

144
00:09:36,579 --> 00:09:37,359
[SPEAKER_03]: They're the metal ones.

145
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,683
[SPEAKER_03]: and I have to say that both disappoint me very much.

146
00:09:42,023 --> 00:09:42,904
[SPEAKER_03]: And guess what?

147
00:09:43,044 --> 00:09:44,726
[SPEAKER_03]: I still have the same opinion about In The Groove.

148
00:09:44,786 --> 00:09:49,911
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still a knockoff of DDR and it's going to be treated as such in my mind.

149
00:09:50,352 --> 00:09:56,418
[SPEAKER_03]: Those new pads, they look pretty solid, but they've got a few fatal flaws in them.

150
00:09:56,538 --> 00:10:01,843
[SPEAKER_03]: One of them being that the arrows are recessed too far and it feels really awkward playing on them and I didn't like them one bit.

151
00:10:01,923 --> 00:10:05,948
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, it might be a personal opinion thing, because when I played them a couple weeks ago, they were great to me.

152
00:10:06,028 --> 00:10:07,790
[SPEAKER_04]: I really enjoyed them.

153
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:21,307
[SPEAKER_03]: All they gotta do to fix it, raise up those arrows just a teeny little bit, just a few millimeters, just to make it, just set in a little bit, not too much, don't go crazy, and then instead of making them all rubbery,

154
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:23,080
[SPEAKER_03]: Make Them Metal.

155
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:26,181
[SPEAKER_04]: But then you played two other DDR mats as well, right?

156
00:10:26,721 --> 00:10:30,021
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and then that one starts to look pretty good when you look at the other two, right?

157
00:10:30,261 --> 00:10:35,902
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, the second one was DDRGame.com, their metal pad with their bar.

158
00:10:36,022 --> 00:10:36,743
[SPEAKER_03]: Which had a bar, yeah.

159
00:10:36,823 --> 00:10:37,823
[SPEAKER_03]: Which had a bar, yeah.

160
00:10:38,383 --> 00:10:39,303
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the pads sucked.

161
00:10:39,403 --> 00:10:46,684
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, those pads, they were all shiny and it basically had soft pad syndrome where you can't tell where the hell the arrows are.

162
00:10:47,084 --> 00:10:50,085
[SPEAKER_03]: And what's worse about the DDRGame.com ones...

163
00:10:51,605 --> 00:10:55,886
[SPEAKER_03]: If you miss the pad, you're going to hurt your leg, because it's raised up.

164
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:57,647
[SPEAKER_04]: Which happened to somebody, we know, actually.

165
00:10:57,847 --> 00:11:02,048
[SPEAKER_03]: It happened to someone, so I cannot recommend this.

166
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:05,489
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's the only one you're going to see that has the solo arrows actually on it.

167
00:11:06,149 --> 00:11:08,670
[SPEAKER_04]: Although most just use the buttons.

168
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:15,312
[SPEAKER_03]: They did do something kind of neat, and I'll give them credit for this, because softpads, they're pretty much all the same out there.

169
00:11:15,332 --> 00:11:18,853
[SPEAKER_03]: But they actually had a doubles softpad, which I thought was pretty cool.

170
00:11:19,758 --> 00:11:23,321
[SPEAKER_03]: The only thing I can see that would suck about that is if one side breaks down.

171
00:11:23,341 --> 00:11:24,101
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh crap.

172
00:11:24,422 --> 00:11:27,484
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I tried that one.

173
00:11:27,524 --> 00:11:28,485
[SPEAKER_03]: That was pretty cool.

174
00:11:29,686 --> 00:11:33,208
[SPEAKER_03]: And really, I don't know, DDR pads, they're just all about the same.

175
00:11:34,529 --> 00:11:37,011
[SPEAKER_03]: Then, what else did I get to try out today?

176
00:11:38,352 --> 00:11:39,553
[SPEAKER_03]: I watched Kingdom Hearts 2.

177
00:11:39,673 --> 00:11:40,894
[SPEAKER_03]: That looked pretty cool.

178
00:11:41,595 --> 00:11:46,899
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, really, it's just a lot of hanging around Konami's booth, checking that stuff out.

179
00:11:47,719 --> 00:12:11,470
[SPEAKER_03]: and talking to like some of the people you know trying to get you know not necessarily press kits but on their email list for my work and that kind of thing and I have to say that the people EA can suck it because they have this you know we're better than everyone else attitude and I mean they've done that to our company as a whole like you know when our company yeah we're distributing games they're like yeah we don't care it's just like big deal you know

180
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:13,791
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the hell with them.

181
00:12:14,011 --> 00:12:19,434
[SPEAKER_03]: And it seems like, honestly, from hearing other people's... Did they have anything at their booth that interested any of us?

182
00:12:19,474 --> 00:12:22,776
[SPEAKER_03]: They had their new test drive, Most Wanted.

183
00:12:23,836 --> 00:12:25,157
[SPEAKER_01]: I was looking at the stuff for The Sims.

184
00:12:25,297 --> 00:12:26,598
[SPEAKER_01]: Sims 2 for PSP is pretty cool.

185
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:29,107
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

186
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:56,634
[SPEAKER_04]: It was kind of a misconception, at least I certainly thought that PlayStation would be one I'd be waiting just as long in as Zelda.

187
00:12:56,914 --> 00:12:59,416
[SPEAKER_04]: But the interesting thing is that the Zelda line ran out of shirts today.

188
00:12:59,476 --> 00:13:01,978
[SPEAKER_04]: So some people that went through the whole thing didn't even get a shirt.

189
00:13:03,019 --> 00:13:07,703
[SPEAKER_03]: I did get to play Nintendogs, and that game is so damn... I've got to get that game.

190
00:13:07,823 --> 00:13:10,805
[SPEAKER_03]: I already knew I was going to buy the game before I actually played it.

191
00:13:11,426 --> 00:13:12,587
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's just...

192
00:13:13,307 --> 00:13:15,370
[SPEAKER_03]: It's such a game, I don't even know.

193
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:21,917
[SPEAKER_03]: This is gonna, honestly, people are gonna play this game and it's gonna be just like Animal Crossing where you just can't get enough of it.

194
00:13:22,017 --> 00:13:23,319
[SPEAKER_03]: You're just gonna be playing it all the time.

195
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:27,083
[SPEAKER_03]: You're gonna be worrying about your pets are not getting walked or something when you're out.

196
00:13:27,263 --> 00:13:29,726
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it is gonna be like the next Tamagotchi.

197
00:13:29,806 --> 00:13:33,650
[SPEAKER_04]: Now don't shun it just because I say it that way, but...

198
00:13:36,192 --> 00:13:40,415
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's going to be something that appeals to a more broader age range.

199
00:13:40,495 --> 00:13:41,816
[SPEAKER_04]: Just the whole trade and everything.

200
00:13:42,016 --> 00:13:45,598
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, Jamie just brought up something to me I forgot to ask her.

201
00:13:45,678 --> 00:13:46,779
[SPEAKER_03]: How was the boomerang?

202
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,041
[SPEAKER_03]: On the PS3?

203
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,822
[SPEAKER_03]: What was your impressions of the boomerang?

204
00:13:51,442 --> 00:13:53,143
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking at my picture of it right now.

205
00:13:54,484 --> 00:13:57,106
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to imagine how this thing would feel in my hand.

206
00:13:58,393 --> 00:14:04,557
[SPEAKER_04]: Now for those that are a little bit lost, the boomerang is what we are calling the controller on the PS3 because it looks like, well, a boomerang.

207
00:14:05,098 --> 00:14:05,478
[SPEAKER_01]: It does.

208
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:06,859
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like a half moon.

209
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:07,639
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what it looks like?

210
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:10,281
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like an old school Microsoft Sidewinder.

211
00:14:10,841 --> 00:14:12,082
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, it does.

212
00:14:12,262 --> 00:14:13,183
[SPEAKER_03]: And guess what, folks?

213
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:14,784
[SPEAKER_03]: The Sidewinder... I don't understand.

214
00:14:14,844 --> 00:14:16,505
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, stick with DualShock.

215
00:14:17,626 --> 00:14:18,367
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I say.

216
00:14:18,707 --> 00:14:24,931
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I couldn't just... It didn't seem like it would be all that comfortable, but I don't know.

217
00:14:25,111 --> 00:14:26,192
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's only conceptual.

218
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:27,673
[SPEAKER_01]: It said concept controller.

219
00:14:29,204 --> 00:14:33,228
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe they'll make some changes and make it less boomerang-y, I don't know.

220
00:14:33,288 --> 00:14:54,188
[SPEAKER_04]: Stuff I checked out today, I actually got to play a little bit of Kingdom Hearts 2, and very interesting, I have to admit I wasn't so into the first one, I know a lot of people consider it to be this great game, and I respect the game, but I couldn't get into it, because I got really, really bothered by the camera, like that whole 3D thing that can annoy me on some of those games sometimes.

221
00:14:54,788 --> 00:15:12,318
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't have these same problems in Kingdom Hearts 2, it looks like they went back and fixed some of that, and they added a couple new modes too, like they have this overdrive mode, like you might think of this from Final Fantasies, kinda similar, but more towards the Kingdom Hearts concept, where if you build up enough strength, you can go into overdrive mode, and you transform, and you have two blades, so that's kinda neat.

222
00:15:12,728 --> 00:15:13,269
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

223
00:15:28,852 --> 00:15:33,555
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, did you actually, uh, of course you had Auron there.

224
00:15:33,596 --> 00:15:34,997
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you do the fusions?

225
00:15:35,637 --> 00:15:37,618
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I did not get a chance to do the fusions.

226
00:15:38,259 --> 00:15:41,221
[SPEAKER_01]: With Goofy, that's the Valor one, that's awesome.

227
00:15:41,241 --> 00:15:42,722
[SPEAKER_01]: He dual-wields the Keyblades.

228
00:15:43,122 --> 00:15:44,763
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, having Auron in the game was kind of neat, though.

229
00:15:44,783 --> 00:15:46,445
[SPEAKER_04]: I gotta say, that's kind of a neat addition to the game.

230
00:15:47,025 --> 00:15:49,287
[SPEAKER_04]: Another game I checked out today was Hello Kitty Roller Rescue.

231
00:15:49,347 --> 00:15:50,908
[SPEAKER_04]: Now stop laughing, stop laughing.

232
00:15:51,972 --> 00:15:56,933
[SPEAKER_04]: I was drawn to this game because I love Batsamaru the penguin and I saw that he was in the game so I had to check it out.

233
00:15:57,613 --> 00:16:00,314
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello Kitty Roller Rescue is very interesting.

234
00:16:00,454 --> 00:16:02,635
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure there's an audience out there for it somewhere.

235
00:16:04,295 --> 00:16:08,076
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though I do love Batsamaru I can't personally say I would buy this game.

236
00:16:08,476 --> 00:16:11,737
[SPEAKER_04]: I would buy it for a child but I don't know if I could buy it for myself.

237
00:16:12,257 --> 00:16:15,818
[SPEAKER_04]: I became too frustrated because Hello Kitty would not jump over everything.

238
00:16:15,858 --> 00:16:19,059
[SPEAKER_04]: There was only certain things like some weird collision detection.

239
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:20,619
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what it is but just...

240
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,021
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't as interactive.

241
00:16:24,161 --> 00:16:24,942
[SPEAKER_04]: It just felt weird.

242
00:16:25,242 --> 00:16:26,222
[SPEAKER_04]: But a kid would be into it.

243
00:16:26,342 --> 00:16:27,503
[SPEAKER_04]: A kid wouldn't be bothered by it.

244
00:16:27,523 --> 00:16:29,403
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what it was really for.

245
00:16:30,124 --> 00:16:32,405
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was one of the other games I saw today.

246
00:16:34,025 --> 00:16:35,446
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that's all I really want to say.

247
00:16:35,626 --> 00:16:36,606
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, one other game.

248
00:16:36,686 --> 00:16:39,047
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually saw this yesterday, but I forgot to bring it up on yesterday's show.

249
00:16:39,568 --> 00:16:40,548
[SPEAKER_04]: The Capcom Collection.

250
00:16:41,308 --> 00:16:43,369
[SPEAKER_04]: It has a bunch of old school Capcom arcade games.

251
00:16:43,629 --> 00:16:46,411
[SPEAKER_04]: Ghouls N' Ghosts, Super Ghouls N' Ghosts, and the one I played, 1943.

252
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:48,151
[SPEAKER_04]: All in it.

253
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:49,552
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of a neat collection.

254
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:53,095
[SPEAKER_04]: Seems like kind of the popular trend right now with the retro-ness.

255
00:16:53,135 --> 00:16:55,276
[SPEAKER_04]: Having the Flashback console, Atari.

256
00:16:55,657 --> 00:16:59,559
[SPEAKER_04]: Having the Capcom collection, the Namco one.

257
00:16:59,599 --> 00:17:01,200
[SPEAKER_04]: They're doing a new one that's really big.

258
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:03,082
[SPEAKER_04]: Very interesting trend.

259
00:17:03,362 --> 00:17:04,923
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you get to play any Final Fight?

260
00:17:05,363 --> 00:17:06,484
[SPEAKER_04]: I did not play Final Fight.

261
00:17:07,225 --> 00:17:09,146
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very wonky right now.

262
00:17:09,566 --> 00:17:10,126
[SPEAKER_01]: It was pretty cool.

263
00:17:10,146 --> 00:17:10,847
[SPEAKER_01]: The new Final Fight?

264
00:17:10,867 --> 00:17:11,407
[SPEAKER_01]: The new Final Fight.

265
00:17:11,427 --> 00:17:11,767
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, yeah.

266
00:17:11,787 --> 00:17:14,989
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually played the new Romancing Saga as well.

267
00:17:15,009 --> 00:17:15,869
[SPEAKER_01]: Which thing?

268
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:17,390
[SPEAKER_01]: I was never big into the Saga games.

269
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:20,811
[SPEAKER_01]: It was kind of cool, but it looks like a freaking PS1 game.

270
00:17:21,371 --> 00:17:22,492
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not clean.

271
00:17:22,692 --> 00:17:25,193
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Sagas were games that never impressed me either.

272
00:17:25,233 --> 00:17:27,114
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, I can sort of follow this.

273
00:17:28,094 --> 00:17:28,415
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

274
00:17:29,115 --> 00:17:33,617
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, now since the show is all done, I'd like us to go around and think about the best games

275
00:17:34,301 --> 00:17:36,943
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do best booth at the show first.

276
00:17:36,983 --> 00:17:38,384
[SPEAKER_04]: The best booth.

277
00:17:38,465 --> 00:17:43,769
[SPEAKER_04]: Who there at the show do you believe had the best booth out of anybody and why?

278
00:17:43,789 --> 00:17:45,250
[SPEAKER_04]: Anybody want to start?

279
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:47,732
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of... DarkSakura.

280
00:17:47,872 --> 00:17:52,416
[SPEAKER_01]: There's places that did things better, I think.

281
00:17:52,876 --> 00:17:57,480
[SPEAKER_01]: But overall, I have to give... It's actually a toss-up.

282
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,701
[SPEAKER_01]: It really is a toss-up.

283
00:17:58,821 --> 00:17:59,521
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, a tie.

284
00:17:59,622 --> 00:18:00,022
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think?

285
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:08,381
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to have to say that between Konami and Namco, I mean, just Konami went all out with that show.

286
00:18:08,481 --> 00:18:10,042
[SPEAKER_01]: That was really cool.

287
00:18:10,082 --> 00:18:14,945
[SPEAKER_01]: So as far as their presentation, Konami had the better show.

288
00:18:15,605 --> 00:18:26,751
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as overall, like I was saying yesterday, friendliness, knowledge, the fun swag, I have to say that Namco really impressed me.

289
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:27,452
[SPEAKER_01]: Their lineup.

290
00:18:27,672 --> 00:18:29,553
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to play, oh, I also played Pack'n Roll.

291
00:18:30,379 --> 00:18:36,523
[SPEAKER_01]: And when someone came over and saw that I had the hang of playing it, they didn't harass me.

292
00:18:36,663 --> 00:18:37,444
[SPEAKER_01]: I just got to play it.

293
00:18:37,484 --> 00:18:38,925
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked a little bit about it.

294
00:18:39,766 --> 00:18:41,987
[SPEAKER_01]: The people at Namco Mobile were fun.

295
00:18:42,067 --> 00:18:43,188
[SPEAKER_01]: They were just happy.

296
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:47,611
[SPEAKER_01]: They ran out of the little squishy Pac-Man things, but they apologized for it.

297
00:18:49,672 --> 00:18:51,394
[SPEAKER_01]: They knew what they were doing.

298
00:18:51,494 --> 00:18:53,275
[SPEAKER_01]: They were happy to do what they were doing.

299
00:18:53,935 --> 00:18:55,176
[SPEAKER_03]: Our co-host for...

300
00:18:56,597 --> 00:19:04,764
[SPEAKER_03]: Outside of the Box, SlankyStyle, he actually got a short video clip of the Prince of the Cosmos breakdancing.

301
00:19:05,965 --> 00:19:06,346
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

302
00:19:07,667 --> 00:19:09,528
[SPEAKER_04]: We're hoping to make a LiveJournal icon out of that.

303
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:12,391
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll have to post that in our Orange Lounge LiveJournal community once that's done.

304
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:16,895
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so DarkSakura saying toss-up between Konami and Namco.

305
00:19:17,535 --> 00:19:19,817
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, what do you think was the best booth at the show?

306
00:19:23,635 --> 00:19:28,078
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, oh man, it's tough.

307
00:19:28,118 --> 00:19:35,162
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so biased just because I hung out at Konami's booth a long time, pretty much the majority of the time while I was there.

308
00:19:36,082 --> 00:19:37,283
[SPEAKER_03]: Only because of a few things.

309
00:19:37,603 --> 00:19:41,325
[SPEAKER_03]: One, the whole stage area right there where they had the DDR games.

310
00:19:41,705 --> 00:19:44,206
[SPEAKER_03]: Very open, you're not really feeling crowded in there.

311
00:19:44,246 --> 00:19:47,428
[SPEAKER_03]: Plus you can sit down and watch the little trailer reel that they've got there.

312
00:19:48,195 --> 00:19:49,477
[SPEAKER_03]: Couldn't really do that anywhere else.

313
00:19:49,957 --> 00:19:58,665
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, I guess as far as being the least offensive booth of them all, because they didn't really have any booth babes jumping around.

314
00:19:58,705 --> 00:20:01,488
[SPEAKER_03]: They had actually something that appealed to everyone.

315
00:20:02,068 --> 00:20:02,909
[SPEAKER_03]: That was kind of cool.

316
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:12,118
[SPEAKER_03]: However, there is a close second, and that would be Game Infinity, and only because they had X-Tango in the sex game there.

317
00:20:12,498 --> 00:20:14,500
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

318
00:20:36,577 --> 00:20:37,238
[SPEAKER_03]: Just sitting there.

319
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:40,162
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, I didn't get it.

320
00:20:40,563 --> 00:20:41,604
[SPEAKER_04]: I just didn't get it.

321
00:20:41,944 --> 00:20:45,770
[SPEAKER_04]: And guys were standing there, probably sitting there thinking, I wonder if they'll do it.

322
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:52,919
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't get it.

323
00:20:53,720 --> 00:21:05,584
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably my second runner-up would be actually the G4 booth because they had a pretty cool setup there as far as like sit down, chill, watch their shows, make a t-shirt, which at least you're guaranteed a t-shirt that way.

324
00:21:06,004 --> 00:21:08,545
[SPEAKER_03]: They had the people giving out those ouch kits.

325
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:09,546
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are pretty awesome.

326
00:21:09,566 --> 00:21:10,346
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.

327
00:21:10,942 --> 00:21:14,825
[SPEAKER_03]: I also have to give a special kudos to the Tylenol Ouch booth and the cute guy that gave me a back massage.

328
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:42,871
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say if I had to pick one booth of the show and I hate to kind of echo what somebody else already said but honestly for me there was one booth that I feel they put all their cards out on the table everybody there was really friendly I got to play their games they have a hell of a lineup this year

329
00:21:43,832 --> 00:22:11,314
[SPEAKER_04]: and that booth would be Namco I would say would be my booth of the year I was just blown away by what they've got to offer I think between like We Heart Katamari, Soul Calibur 3, Pac-Man and even semi-decent mobile games as well and usually I'm not very impressed with cell phone games but the ones I played were pretty decent for a cell phone certainly more so than some of the other ones I played at the show and I just felt that Namco they also had various stage shows going on with the whole Soul Calibur battles and stuff

330
00:22:12,533 --> 00:22:15,035
[SPEAKER_04]: It really was, for me, I think the most impressive lineup at the show.

331
00:22:15,575 --> 00:22:16,916
[SPEAKER_04]: So that would be my booth as a show.

332
00:22:16,976 --> 00:22:17,277
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

333
00:22:18,277 --> 00:22:21,920
[SPEAKER_04]: Best... You want to do best game or you want to do worst booth next?

334
00:22:22,961 --> 00:22:23,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Worst booth.

335
00:22:23,802 --> 00:22:24,182
[SPEAKER_04]: Worst booth.

336
00:22:24,202 --> 00:22:24,863
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.

337
00:22:27,165 --> 00:22:28,806
[SPEAKER_01]: For attitude, it was Capcom.

338
00:22:29,467 --> 00:22:34,150
[SPEAKER_01]: Bunch of apathetic... You know, Capcom as a company has my love.

339
00:22:34,411 --> 00:22:36,432
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, been a long time Capcom fan.

340
00:22:36,893 --> 00:22:39,495
[SPEAKER_01]: But the people who they had working the information booth...

341
00:22:40,709 --> 00:22:42,150
[SPEAKER_01]: They were just rude.

342
00:22:42,951 --> 00:22:43,992
[SPEAKER_01]: Rude as they could be.

343
00:22:44,212 --> 00:22:47,754
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we kind of talked about it yesterday, so you guys know how we feel about it.

344
00:22:47,874 --> 00:22:53,058
[SPEAKER_01]: They just displayed so much apathy that I can't say that Capcom really impressed me.

345
00:22:53,078 --> 00:22:55,940
[SPEAKER_04]: They really didn't have a whole lot of games.

346
00:22:56,241 --> 00:23:01,965
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, and I want to answer an email real quick, because while we're on Capcom, I'm so sorry to interject, but if I don't do it now, I'll forget.

347
00:23:02,245 --> 00:23:09,831
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody wrote us an email about Mega Man Battle Network and wanted to know how it would link up with the other DS...

348
00:23:10,875 --> 00:23:11,775
[SPEAKER_04]: Battle Network Games.

349
00:23:12,295 --> 00:23:20,877
[SPEAKER_04]: And basically what we found out is that there is some type of tournament mode, so you can play Battle Network against the DS Wireless, but we did not see anything in any of the materials so far.

350
00:23:20,937 --> 00:23:26,918
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't dug through the whole book, but in the little promo video we saw, we didn't see anything about it linking up to the Game Boy Advance versions or anything.

351
00:23:26,958 --> 00:23:29,938
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a type of online battle tournament mode.

352
00:23:29,978 --> 00:23:31,079
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, I just wanted to interject that.

353
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:37,120
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

354
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,260
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody put on a really good display game

355
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:44,458
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, Gizmondo was also really excellent for... We're doing worse poof!

356
00:23:44,538 --> 00:23:45,939
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm using it as a comparison.

357
00:23:46,339 --> 00:23:49,961
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, you know, Gizmondo was sort of like, eh, we're Gizmondo last year.

358
00:23:50,562 --> 00:23:56,425
[SPEAKER_01]: And this year, like, hey, we're freaking Gizmondo and we're bringing out people to rap and spin and dance for you and everything.

359
00:23:57,046 --> 00:24:00,628
[SPEAKER_01]: But, Capcom was the same as they were last year.

360
00:24:00,668 --> 00:24:02,809
[SPEAKER_01]: Just, we don't want to fucking be here.

361
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:06,652
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, true, it may be work.

362
00:24:07,219 --> 00:24:09,000
[SPEAKER_01]: But you should be happy in the work that you do.

363
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:13,641
[SPEAKER_01]: And the guys at Namco, they were having to do every bit of a boring job that you were.

364
00:24:14,061 --> 00:24:15,742
[SPEAKER_01]: But they were all smiles and friendly.

365
00:24:16,942 --> 00:24:20,984
[SPEAKER_01]: So Capcom must be the dullest place on earth to work for or something.

366
00:24:21,844 --> 00:24:23,445
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so is that your worst booth?

367
00:24:23,465 --> 00:24:25,225
[SPEAKER_04]: Or do you have an overall worst booth?

368
00:24:25,325 --> 00:24:28,647
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, like I said, the displays and everything were great.

369
00:24:29,027 --> 00:24:33,768
[SPEAKER_01]: For everywhere, there wasn't anything really disappointing as far as their look.

370
00:24:35,049 --> 00:24:35,309
[SPEAKER_01]: But...

371
00:24:36,718 --> 00:24:39,739
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I have to say that Capcom, it was just the attitude.

372
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:41,960
[SPEAKER_01]: The attitude soured their whole booth for me.

373
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:43,081
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, Loki.

374
00:24:44,421 --> 00:24:45,082
[SPEAKER_03]: This one's easy.

375
00:24:46,382 --> 00:24:51,684
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to give a big thank you to Rockstar for saving me time for having to play their games.

376
00:24:52,124 --> 00:24:52,865
[SPEAKER_03]: Because guess what?

377
00:24:52,925 --> 00:24:58,027
[SPEAKER_03]: They rented out this huge, huge booth and put some buses there and said, Ha!

378
00:24:58,147 --> 00:24:59,448
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't get to play anything!

379
00:24:59,728 --> 00:25:00,128
[SPEAKER_03]: Eat that!

380
00:25:00,468 --> 00:25:01,708
[SPEAKER_03]: You're gonna buy our games anyways.

381
00:25:02,049 --> 00:25:02,869
[SPEAKER_03]: Suck it!

382
00:25:03,229 --> 00:25:03,769
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was it.

383
00:25:03,829 --> 00:25:05,150
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't have jacked.

384
00:25:08,231 --> 00:25:17,615
[SPEAKER_03]: The only picture I saw of Bully was in a magazine I got there for free.

385
00:25:18,055 --> 00:25:23,977
[SPEAKER_03]: So I actually saw more of Rockstar's lineup from some stupid magazine than, you know, their actual booth.

386
00:25:24,417 --> 00:25:33,121
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what, I'm tired of these game companies thinking that their stuff's all kick-ass just because, you know, the last couple games, which have all been exactly the same, I might add,

387
00:25:33,741 --> 00:25:34,921
[SPEAKER_03]: have sold really awesome.

388
00:25:34,941 --> 00:25:35,521
[SPEAKER_03]: But guess what?

389
00:25:35,541 --> 00:25:36,001
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

390
00:25:36,041 --> 00:25:37,482
[SPEAKER_03]: Save Emergency sucked balls.

391
00:25:37,562 --> 00:25:38,262
[SPEAKER_03]: So you know what?

392
00:25:39,462 --> 00:25:46,643
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope Bully does too because I'm not giving you my money just for the same damn rehash game with maybe a different genre.

393
00:25:47,103 --> 00:25:49,564
[SPEAKER_03]: Not necessarily a different genre, a different time period it's set in.

394
00:25:51,224 --> 00:25:51,544
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

395
00:25:51,584 --> 00:25:58,505
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, for my worst booth, again, I hate to echo what somebody else already said, but just because of the fact that it was an eyesore.

396
00:25:58,565 --> 00:26:00,626
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the booth itself was an eyesore.

397
00:26:00,986 --> 00:26:01,666
[SPEAKER_04]: And just the fact...

398
00:26:02,196 --> 00:26:02,817
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

399
00:26:17,478 --> 00:26:19,160
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't want to stop and look at anything.

400
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,601
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know they're trying to show new games.

401
00:26:20,821 --> 00:26:22,543
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't want to stop and look.

402
00:26:22,583 --> 00:26:24,025
[SPEAKER_04]: Horrible position for them, too.

403
00:26:24,245 --> 00:26:25,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Their booth was in a bad spot, too.

404
00:26:25,206 --> 00:26:31,212
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand if they want to do press-only for these games, because obviously they're probably in progress and they don't want any bad people to look.

405
00:26:31,472 --> 00:26:35,315
[SPEAKER_03]: But even still, last year, I didn't see their games.

406
00:26:35,976 --> 00:26:37,598
[SPEAKER_03]: They were behind closed doors.

407
00:26:37,618 --> 00:26:39,279
[SPEAKER_03]: You can go and make an appointment to play it.

408
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,421
[SPEAKER_03]: This was just like rubbing it in your face.

409
00:26:41,481 --> 00:26:41,762
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like...

410
00:26:42,402 --> 00:26:43,623
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, hey, guess what?

411
00:26:43,703 --> 00:26:47,627
[SPEAKER_03]: You can go in here and play games if you're pressed and if you make an appointment.

412
00:26:47,687 --> 00:26:51,630
[SPEAKER_04]: And just the chain-link fence and the giant buses were just an eyesore.

413
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:52,611
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't need to be there.

414
00:26:52,631 --> 00:26:59,836
[SPEAKER_04]: With all the other neon nice effects, just to have that ghetto-looking booth was just... You know what?

415
00:27:00,097 --> 00:27:05,561
[SPEAKER_03]: I honestly learned about Rockstar's lineup from posters that were outside on Hollywood Boulevard.

416
00:27:05,601 --> 00:27:07,182
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where I learned about their stuff.

417
00:27:07,202 --> 00:27:11,406
[SPEAKER_03]: So when I saw their booth with the buses, I was like, whoopity-freaking-doo-dah, you know?

418
00:27:12,126 --> 00:27:13,168
[SPEAKER_03]: There are so many good ones.

419
00:27:35,171 --> 00:27:35,993
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

420
00:27:47,236 --> 00:27:49,297
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a toss-up between three games, seriously.

421
00:27:49,337 --> 00:27:50,417
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, then name the three.

422
00:27:51,177 --> 00:27:53,138
[SPEAKER_01]: We Love Katamari, definitely.

423
00:27:53,578 --> 00:27:55,378
[SPEAKER_01]: Nintendogs and Animal Crossing DS.

424
00:27:58,179 --> 00:28:00,540
[SPEAKER_01]: And Call of Cthulhu, but I'm not going to go into that.

425
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:05,501
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would have to say those three were the top of the show.

426
00:28:05,521 --> 00:28:08,042
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, actually, those three had me convinced to be the top of the show.

427
00:28:08,763 --> 00:28:10,424
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna get We Heart Katamari, that's for sure.

428
00:28:10,444 --> 00:28:10,925
[SPEAKER_01]: And why is that?

429
00:28:30,778 --> 00:28:31,939
[SPEAKER_03]: It's because it's Katamari.

430
00:28:31,979 --> 00:28:32,579
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just fun.

431
00:28:32,819 --> 00:28:33,639
[SPEAKER_03]: It's also cheap.

432
00:28:33,659 --> 00:28:36,040
[SPEAKER_04]: What does the sequel offer that the first one doesn't though?

433
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:37,821
[SPEAKER_04]: Why should people run out and get it?

434
00:28:38,221 --> 00:28:40,542
[SPEAKER_03]: It's more of the same game.

435
00:28:40,642 --> 00:28:41,142
[SPEAKER_03]: Who cares?

436
00:28:42,063 --> 00:28:43,123
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why you want to get it.

437
00:28:43,203 --> 00:28:47,305
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything you loved about the first game is in the second game and just wackier and better.

438
00:28:47,665 --> 00:28:48,085
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me help.

439
00:28:48,145 --> 00:28:49,307
[SPEAKER_03]: Co-op mode as well.

440
00:28:50,488 --> 00:28:51,248
[SPEAKER_03]: Who cares about that?

441
00:28:51,809 --> 00:28:53,270
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just talking about more game.

442
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:55,532
[SPEAKER_03]: You finish the first game and you're like, I want more.

443
00:28:55,892 --> 00:28:56,473
[SPEAKER_03]: Give me more.

444
00:28:58,094 --> 00:28:59,015
[SPEAKER_03]: This will be cool.

445
00:28:59,035 --> 00:29:01,437
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendogs will be awesome.

446
00:29:01,457 --> 00:29:05,961
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got to get Animal Crossing just because everyone else is going to have it and I don't want to feel left out.

447
00:29:06,782 --> 00:29:09,604
[SPEAKER_03]: I think those are probably the ones.

448
00:29:09,905 --> 00:29:11,646
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going to let your puppies play with my puppies?

449
00:29:12,987 --> 00:29:13,248
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

450
00:29:13,488 --> 00:29:14,689
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to call my dog Bacon.

451
00:29:16,522 --> 00:29:16,822
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

452
00:29:17,903 --> 00:29:28,274
[SPEAKER_04]: My game of the show, you know I love games that do something new that isn't just the same old crap over and over again and bring something new to the table.

453
00:29:28,434 --> 00:29:37,623
[SPEAKER_04]: I like interactive games that help you do – like I loved Animal Crossing 1 because you could interact with other people in unique ways.

454
00:29:37,703 --> 00:29:39,245
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just love originality.

455
00:29:39,865 --> 00:29:49,754
[SPEAKER_04]: and this game was just damn good looking too and I had fun with it I had a lot of fun with it which is something I cannot say about most games game of the show for me would be Nintendogs

456
00:29:51,069 --> 00:29:55,091
[SPEAKER_04]: which is odd because I'm totally not a dog person but I loved Nintendogs.

457
00:29:55,512 --> 00:29:56,732
[SPEAKER_03]: It was so cute.

458
00:29:57,193 --> 00:29:59,294
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to discuss this stuff right here.

459
00:29:59,434 --> 00:30:07,218
[SPEAKER_03]: I pulled open my little show daily magazine here and they have one of .com awards for what they thought were the best in show stuff.

460
00:30:07,818 --> 00:30:09,599
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I finish my thought on best in show stuff?

461
00:30:09,639 --> 00:30:10,560
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I thought you were done.

462
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,320
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm not done.

463
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:11,920
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a runner-up.

464
00:30:12,641 --> 00:30:13,401
[SPEAKER_04]: You all got a runner-up.

465
00:30:13,421 --> 00:30:13,982
[SPEAKER_04]: I want a runner-up.

466
00:30:14,482 --> 00:30:18,484
[SPEAKER_04]: My runner-up would be actually Meteos, the new puzzle game that's going to be coming out on DSP.

467
00:30:19,071 --> 00:30:20,052
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

468
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:44,468
[SPEAKER_04]: The best in show, my thoughts, and runner-up to DS games, when I've kind of knocked the DS quite a bit over the past few months because they've had really a crap lineup.

469
00:30:44,828 --> 00:30:51,410
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the DS is, it is true, the DS is going to get a hell of a lot better over the next nine months.

470
00:30:51,750 --> 00:31:01,853
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, if you are in the DS versus PSP mindset, I still think both systems are very separate, and if you really want to experience everything, you're going to have to own both.

471
00:31:02,804 --> 00:31:06,265
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be a close contest for those looking at one or the other.

472
00:31:06,905 --> 00:31:08,026
[SPEAKER_03]: Just look at it this way, people.

473
00:31:08,066 --> 00:31:13,027
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not going to have to actually get an external keyboard if they put Linux on the DS versus the PSP.

474
00:31:13,527 --> 00:31:16,788
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a moment of comedy, though, speaking of the DS stuff.

475
00:31:17,648 --> 00:31:21,349
[SPEAKER_01]: I was trying to download Electroplankton from the PSP area.

476
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:26,351
[SPEAKER_01]: And having a Sony person comment on it.

477
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:28,400
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh.

478
00:31:29,361 --> 00:31:29,822
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

479
00:31:30,863 --> 00:31:34,206
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, yeah, Loki, you were going to get into what somebody else felt was the best.

480
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:37,289
[SPEAKER_03]: 1up.com, their awards, Game of the Show, they gave it to Legend of Zelda.

481
00:31:37,349 --> 00:31:48,079
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't seen the game, so... Yeah, I mean, to be honest, I think our awards, quote-unquote, you have to remember, are from our perspective, and our perspective was we were...

482
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:58,405
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though we're borderline media, we went in as non-media, just like the sales people, just like the students and the folks that are barely in the industry.

483
00:31:58,666 --> 00:32:08,131
[SPEAKER_04]: From our perspective, Legend of Zelda was not easily accessible, so therefore it kind of gets a strike against it when it comes to really the most impressive thing at the show.

484
00:32:08,372 --> 00:32:08,872
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

485
00:32:09,172 --> 00:32:11,193
[SPEAKER_03]: Best visuals, Unreal Tournament 2007.

486
00:32:11,794 --> 00:32:14,495
[SPEAKER_03]: Once again, another thing that you had to wait in line to go see.

487
00:32:14,536 --> 00:32:15,116
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, uh-huh.

488
00:32:15,556 --> 00:32:18,639
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

489
00:32:32,553 --> 00:32:32,834
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.

490
00:32:32,934 --> 00:32:34,855
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually is sort of music-y, too.

491
00:32:35,396 --> 00:32:37,078
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, Electric Plankton's really bizarre.

492
00:32:37,118 --> 00:32:38,239
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been wanting that game for a while.

493
00:32:38,259 --> 00:32:42,963
[SPEAKER_03]: What was that one game that we were playing that was on the... Oh, God.

494
00:32:43,083 --> 00:32:43,964
[SPEAKER_03]: The other system.

495
00:32:44,004 --> 00:32:46,867
[SPEAKER_03]: The other portable system that you were hyping up.

496
00:32:46,887 --> 00:32:47,287
[SPEAKER_03]: Gizmondo.

497
00:32:47,687 --> 00:32:48,448
[SPEAKER_03]: Gizmondo, yes.

498
00:32:48,768 --> 00:32:49,269
[SPEAKER_03]: What was that game?

499
00:32:49,289 --> 00:32:50,250
[SPEAKER_03]: The guitar one.

500
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:51,331
[SPEAKER_01]: The guitar game?

501
00:32:51,831 --> 00:32:54,113
[SPEAKER_01]: It was called Johnny Wonder, I think it was.

502
00:32:54,133 --> 00:32:54,994
[SPEAKER_03]: That was pretty cool.

503
00:32:55,154 --> 00:32:57,797
[SPEAKER_01]: It had a little karaoke mode where you sort of...

504
00:32:58,863 --> 00:33:00,904
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, hit directions and rhythm.

505
00:33:01,285 --> 00:33:05,887
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like a music and rhythm game meets an action game, which was kind of cool.

506
00:33:06,187 --> 00:33:10,330
[SPEAKER_01]: You have like an action mode where you kill things by wailing hard on your guitar.

507
00:33:12,251 --> 00:33:13,572
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, next one.

508
00:33:13,732 --> 00:33:14,472
[SPEAKER_03]: So one more award.

509
00:33:15,053 --> 00:33:20,236
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, how about we do, well, without a doubt.

510
00:33:20,256 --> 00:33:25,279
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, this is coming from the show book from 1up.com's awards.

511
00:33:25,699 --> 00:33:28,401
[SPEAKER_03]: Best simulation game, Nintendogs, without a doubt.

512
00:33:28,661 --> 00:33:28,941
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

513
00:33:29,121 --> 00:33:33,682
[SPEAKER_03]: And, yeah, you can find all this stuff on 1up.com or if you luckily have one of these things.

514
00:33:33,942 --> 00:33:40,484
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a game that they listed on here which is cool, Best PC Game Sport, which is by Will Wright, which, you know, it's going to be pretty good, I'm sure.

515
00:33:40,504 --> 00:33:45,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of PC games, I was a little disappointed that I really didn't see any Civilization IV.

516
00:33:46,146 --> 00:33:50,027
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw huge banners for it, but no place you could really go look at it.

517
00:33:50,067 --> 00:33:54,968
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess they were doing trailers and teasers, but I was really hoping I'd be able to get my hands on it.

518
00:33:55,308 --> 00:33:55,728
[SPEAKER_04]: Couldn't do it.

519
00:33:56,567 --> 00:33:57,208
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

520
00:34:18,368 --> 00:34:19,910
[SPEAKER_04]: I went by it towards the beginning of the show.

521
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:20,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally empty.

522
00:34:21,051 --> 00:34:21,571
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally empty.

523
00:34:23,193 --> 00:34:24,154
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of sad.

524
00:34:24,214 --> 00:34:28,498
[SPEAKER_03]: There was more people inside the Rockstar booth than there were in the Engage Arena.

525
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:30,881
[SPEAKER_04]: So kind of sad, but that's what happens.

526
00:34:31,494 --> 00:34:31,774
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

527
00:34:54,767 --> 00:34:59,990
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess with that... Oh, and our podcast, of course, is always updated late Sunday night, early Monday morning.

528
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:01,031
[SPEAKER_04]: Check it once a week.

529
00:35:01,071 --> 00:35:02,852
[SPEAKER_04]: We will have another show in a couple days here.

530
00:35:03,393 --> 00:35:06,134
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of, once again, wrapping it all up from E3 and taking your questions.

531
00:35:06,475 --> 00:35:10,917
[SPEAKER_04]: Just an FYI, our E3 at OrangeLoungeRadio.com address is now closed.

532
00:35:11,198 --> 00:35:12,418
[SPEAKER_04]: Please do not use that address.

533
00:35:12,458 --> 00:35:13,179
[SPEAKER_04]: The show's over.

534
00:35:13,539 --> 00:35:15,040
[SPEAKER_04]: Those emails will bounce back to you.

535
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:19,621
[SPEAKER_04]: If you would like to give us feedback, though, or you want to comment on the show in general, we do still welcome those emails.

536
00:35:19,641 --> 00:35:24,443
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have E3 show feedback or you want to comment on something, we'd still love to hear from you guys.

537
00:35:24,743 --> 00:35:28,104
[SPEAKER_04]: Togo, T-O-G-O, at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

538
00:35:28,364 --> 00:35:34,866
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you're a game publisher and you want to send us free stuff, that's Loki at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

539
00:35:34,946 --> 00:35:35,606
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, nice.

540
00:35:35,726 --> 00:35:36,847
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

541
00:35:36,967 --> 00:35:40,868
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, let's go around and give everybody's final thought, final E3 thought.

542
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:41,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

543
00:35:42,273 --> 00:35:46,355
[SPEAKER_03]: That pizza I had this morning wasn't cooked all the way, and there will be hell to pay.

544
00:35:46,536 --> 00:35:47,376
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell to pay!

545
00:35:49,097 --> 00:35:54,460
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a bacon-covered wiener, and it was good, and it was cooked in onions.

546
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,202
[SPEAKER_01]: So it tasted like a bacon-covered onion wiener.

547
00:35:58,062 --> 00:35:59,183
[SPEAKER_01]: And reject false icons.

548
00:36:02,899 --> 00:36:03,660
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Loki, yes.

549
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,101
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you want to be my final thought?

550
00:36:05,182 --> 00:36:15,912
[SPEAKER_04]: My final thought would be that I think it's very ironic that the ferret and the Orange Lounge Radio Media CD ended up within, like, a foot of each other on the giant Katamari.

551
00:36:16,213 --> 00:36:17,734
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wonder where they're going to roll that thing to.

552
00:36:17,754 --> 00:36:20,497
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just going to say that the Katamari claimed the ferret.

553
00:36:20,697 --> 00:36:21,418
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, so...

554
00:36:22,677 --> 00:36:23,918
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the retard ferret, right?

555
00:36:24,638 --> 00:36:26,360
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it was the one that made all the cool sounds.

556
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,241
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently I made a mistake.

557
00:36:28,381 --> 00:36:30,523
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I took the one that Loki had operated on.

558
00:36:30,943 --> 00:36:35,246
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't the one you've been using on the shows because that's still in your green chair, so don't cry.

559
00:36:35,647 --> 00:36:38,529
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the ferret is my special friend.

560
00:36:39,301 --> 00:36:41,042
[SPEAKER_04]: He's with the king of the cosmos now.

561
00:36:41,222 --> 00:36:41,483
[SPEAKER_04]: Deal.

562
00:36:42,623 --> 00:36:43,044
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

563
00:36:43,864 --> 00:36:50,569
[SPEAKER_04]: From us here at E3 to you guys, thank you for downloading us and checking us out, subscribing to the podcast, and tuning in to our E3 coverage.

564
00:36:50,889 --> 00:36:52,130
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, we'll be back in 2006.

565
00:36:52,530 --> 00:37:01,036
[SPEAKER_04]: And next time, watch out because we are going to be storming the booze next year with all access passes if we have anything to say about it.

566
00:37:01,076 --> 00:37:01,896
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll try.

567
00:37:01,996 --> 00:37:03,958
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see if the woman will let me next year.

568
00:37:04,178 --> 00:37:04,418
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

569
00:37:04,438 --> 00:37:04,718
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

570
00:37:04,978 --> 00:37:05,619
[SPEAKER_03]: Goodbye, everybody.

571
00:37:06,633 --> 00:37:10,197
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the end of another Orange Lounge Radio To Go edition.
