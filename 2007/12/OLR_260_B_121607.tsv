19773	20193	Temptation Sonata
48757	52760	I kind of like this song.
54321	56642	I believe it was even a cage match pick at one time.
57222	65027	Anyways, you may remember that the video featured blatant rip-offs of scenes from Advent Children.
65687	72131	Well, apparently Square Enix won a case against them for plagiarism.
72771	73512	And to the tune of,
75479	78181	16 million won, or $17,400.
78221	83665	I guess the won is like pesos, apparently.
86247	86748	So, yeah.
88369	89750	Oh, well.
89990	90591	$17,000, that's not bad.
91511	92872	But the video was pretty cool.
93253	95034	I mean, I don't know if you saw it.
95114	95895	I've seen it.
95975	98277	She had like two other good songs on the album, too.
98977	103481	It was neat because it was, you know, Advent Children, but other than that, it was, you know,
105100	105660	Operator 11, our bandwidth
135270	139433	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
161752	166375	Final Fantasy IV is getting a sequel, and this to me is awesome news.
166475	171779	I am so happy because Final Fantasy IV is my favorite in the entire Final Fantasy series.
171879	181064	I know, say what you will, Final Fantasy VII, rah, rah, rah, Final Fantasy IX, or not IX, Final Fantasy VI, well, something like IX, but Final Fantasy VI, rah, rah, rah, there's always that back and forth.
181305	183166	I have a soft spot in my heart for Final Fantasy IV.
183806	184687	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
213428	214829	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
244505	247586	I was so angsty when I read this news earlier in the week.
247646	248427	I said, you know what?
248567	252228	I know what segment I want to have follow this news story when we read it this week.
262293	270036	Right, it's the FUs of the week, and Jamie's going to start us off.
270620	274661	My FU of the week goes towards the doctor that I saw who is not my regular doctor.
275641	278062	First of all, I'm not an idiot.
278742	281022	You can tell me what's freaking wrong.
281362	283503	You can tell me what you suspect to be wrong.
284383	287704	And, you know, I usually can follow what you're saying.
288104	289704	My doctor is great, okay?
290584	298286	If ever I remotely suspect anything is wrong or have an idea of what might be the cause, because you know me, I'll research the crap out of everything.
298786	299726	He listens to me.
300385	328324	and then he actually tests for the stuff that I suggest which is how we found out how to treat chronic fatigue for me so that I could actually not pass out on a daily basis or be hurt or anything what happened is when I was in Alabama and I don't know how I did it but my right hand ring finger the tendon started to catch and I wouldn't be able to lift my finger in the morning unless I massaged it and got blood flowing
329068	356822	and it was really inflamed along the tendon that goes down my palm so I went to see this doctor and my regular doctor I guess was out for the holidays or something so you know he tested it and you know I had been icing it and doing all the right stuff but he said okay we're gonna give you a cortisone shot I was like what's actually wrong with it oh it's fine we'll just do the shot and so he didn't tell me anything so I actually I got a cortisone shot in my hand
358560	359881	And he wouldn't let me watch it either.
359941	360701	It pissed me off.
361061	364243	Because I actually, I don't have the fear of needles that I used to.
365143	367004	I give myself a shot in the leg twice a week.
367044	369125	I can stand watching a needle in my hand.
369685	374867	So he said he wouldn't do it until I would not watch him put the needle in.
375207	377388	I was like, dude, I'm not going to pass out.
377428	378949	And he's like, are you squeamish?
379009	379869	Are you going to pass out?
379889	381690	And I'm like, no.
382570	385912	And so it took me looking up the symptoms myself.
386886	389747	And then looking up the treatments, I realized that he was treating me for trigger finger.
391808	395789	Which is funny, because my grandma and I actually just had surgery on that one, like, about a month ago.
395809	397790	Runs in the family, right?
398831	399571	It's not hereditary.
400011	400171	Oh.
400411	407274	Trigger finger has to do with inflammation of the tendons, and that it's slipping out of the tendon sheath that goes over the tendons.
407294	408254	Then it's just irony.
408914	411135	Yeah, it's coincidence.
413096	415137	However, I will go ahead and say that...
416508	418229	I am having a lot less pain in the hand.
418289	420771	It's going to be another few days before the cortisone takes full effect.
421231	422572	And I start physical therapy next week.
422672	425094	So that's, you know, fun, but not.
425974	433880	So, FU to doctors who do not communicate with their patients.
434760	435081	Alright.
435421	437002	I'm going to go back and see my regular doctor.
437402	437882	Let's move on.
437922	438703	Loki, your FU.
440064	446208	Anyways, my FU of the week, not a big surprise, to EBGA for giving me a card that's
446790	475998	Dead on Arrival and for the other thing also for the card being a gimp version of the normal card that should have been or the motherboard being a gimp version of that with no possible way for me to know what's going wrong when there is something going wrong so now I just have to kind of guess it'll be the last time I buy a motherboard from them and it'll probably be the last time I buy a motherboard from Newegg as well because they apparently are pawning off crap that's gimp versions of the real thing so that sucks
477042	478023	I'll buy from Fry's.
478043	485547	So that way if it sucks and it's not working, I can take it right back the next day or the same day instead of having to do this whole arming process.
487808	488608	Alright, is that it?
489149	489509	That's it.
489849	491670	My FU of the week goes to Mondays.
492490	493171	I'll keep it short.
493231	494591	I hate Mondays as do we all.
494631	499954	You know, Jamie, when you get that controlling time thing figured out, can you figure out a way to do away with Mondays?
501475	503416	Maybe we should just give Monday a different name.
504357	504917	Fun Day!
505017	506498	But it would be the same thing.
507017	508398	No, I don't like that idea.
509058	509858	Some days are horrible.
510919	512179	Alright, so that's it.
512219	513179	That's my FU of the week.
514460	516301	Now we can get back into some gaming news, can't we?
516921	517761	Yes, we can.
520722	522283	Well, we have some news.
523887	535099	For our friends who are interested in GameTap, we will be having Street Fighter 3 Third Strike as of December 20th.
535539	540304	No online play, but it's Street Fighter 3 Third Strike.
541686	542827	So hey, that's good.
545014	554020	And on top of that, if you've got the Capcom joystick, I think they actually do have some compatibility with it through GameTap.
554941	556842	It's been a long time since I've used that service.
556983	561025	I was kind of sad about the games leaving, and I guess they did some client upgrade.
561045	562066	I haven't even checked it out yet.
563447	567690	If I'm not playing it enough, I ought to just cancel the darn thing, but there's still a lot about it I like.
568070	568431	We'll see.
570832	571773	Moving on with more news.
572834	573014	Yes.
574376	580261	Anyways, so, I don't know, this isn't really a big surprise for me, but Mass Effect is selling very well.
580781	582783	In fact, they've sold millions.
583563	591890	And over the three weeks since launch, they have sold over one million units globally.
592891	595893	And, you know, that should be pretty good, I guess.
595913	598295	I don't know, it's a good game.
598595	600576	I'd like to sell a million copies of anything.
600616	602878	I mean, that would be pretty good for business, I would think.
603699	603819	Wow.
604378	605559	All right, millions of copies.
606780	610583	I bet a lot of people would like certain other games to sell a million copies worldwide.
610623	611544	Like the Eye of Judgment?
612765	613046	Maybe.
613306	613546	Maybe.
614073	615214	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
643359	643960	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
673581	674422	Assassin's Creed has sold a bunch.
697307	704509	They have sold 2.5 million copies globally and they've sold a whole bunch more than they thought it would.
705770	709891	They are hoping to reach 5 million by March 08.
711032	712632	And I still have yet to play the damn game.
713052	713933	I think I have it.
713973	715093	You can probably borrow mine.
716621	716881	Really?
716901	724108	I kind of want to play it before our year-end show, because I hear a lot of people saying it's a great game and deserves to be on year-end's best list.
724148	727210	So it won't make mine, though, if I don't ever get a chance to play it.
727270	729072	So I may take you up on that, Jamie.
730333	731714	Did you play Assassin's Creed, Loki?
731874	733556	You talked about it.
733576	734617	But you didn't like it, right?
734977	735237	No.
735377	736298	What was your problem with it?
737800	738560	I don't know.
740422	742043	I just didn't like how intricate it was.
742584	742744	The...
743280	744441	Control Scheme for it.
744541	745281	I didn't care for it.
745361	747002	I just really didn't get to play it much.
748342	751163	The thing was, it didn't really hook me, I guess.
751543	754985	I played it for a few minutes, and I was like, eh, I don't really want to give this any more time.
756125	757466	Alright, so I didn't.
760147	772372	Anyways, so there's some interesting news coming out from the company Gearbox, and of course they have done stuff on
773052	802761	like the brand new Brothers in Arms series Hell's Highway actually one of the titles that keeps getting pushed back so one thing that they're looking for to for some inspiration is actually the game Portal because most of their games I think in the past have been pretty linear they like the way that Portal kind of the whole story layout and stuff like that so hopefully in the future we'll see some more kind of futuristic games from Gearbox so that's pretty cool
803956	805397	Now you're a big fan of Portal, Jamie.
805917	806537	Yes, I am.
806857	810599	And do you believe that more games should take inspiration from Portal?
812420	813020	I think so.
813100	828707	I mean, because honestly what they're doing is taking... I actually have to say, because also listening to some of the commentary in the game, I think it was pretty cool that they were taking different concepts in physics and trying to incorporate them into the gameplay in a completely different way.
828847	829567	You know, changing...
830646	840014	Instead of having puzzle here, you don't necessarily think in height and width and depth.
840094	845679	You think in terms of manipulating that space to your own ends, and I think that that's pretty cool.
846280	852625	And it completely offers a completely different range of freedom, I think, as far as how they can design a game.
853820	854220	Very cool.
854280	856101	I'm going to have to listen to that commentary stuff sometime.
856161	858042	I think more games should have commentary tracks on it.
858062	859422	I think that's a pretty interesting idea.
859802	862303	Well, it's hard to have a commentary track in the game.
862343	868085	I like the way that Portal kind of did it, where you just kind of go up to something and then kind of play the game from there.
868846	875788	It had like a little chat box over it that you could highlight with your gun, and then it would play.
876949	880270	And it actually gave you a meter bar so you could see how far through the commentary you were and you could pause it.
880530	880770	Huh.
881170	881691	That's pretty cool.
882151	882491	Interesting.
883820	884342	DarkSakura.com
890911	892852	It's a plush companion cube.
892912	893353	That's right.
893453	902079	There is officially... Now, you may have seen this, that there was a lot of fan-made, weighted companion cubes being made, and there was a lot of fan stuff.
902399	908883	Well, Valve actually decided to put their own version out, because I'm sure they're seeing what other people are doing, and they're like, hey, we need to get a piece of that.
909183	915648	So they put out official weighted companion cube plushies, and in less than 24 hours, the damn thing sold out.
915708	917269	That's how popular these things are.
917529	919229	I'm actually seeing if they still have the fuzzy dice.
919630	924411	They went on sale at 4 o'clock on Friday and sold out by noon on Saturday.
924831	925551	That's crazy.
926011	927051	I guess they'll have to make more.
927511	928412	I just want the fuzzy dice.
928652	930132	These could be more popular than the Wii.
930912	931812	I just want the fuzzy dice.
931932	932713	You just want the fuzzy dice?
932913	934213	Are you actually going to hang them in your car?
934433	937074	Yes, I will because my Pac-Man dice are highly faded now.
937254	937714	Oh, that's too bad.
937734	939354	Well, then your waiting companion cubes will fade.
939634	941195	They'll burn up just like they do in the game.
942235	942915	Spoiler!
943015	943475	Oh, my bad.
944895	945196	You know what?
945236	946516	Dan was really funny about that part.
946776	947076	How so?
947817	959599	I think, as what I mentioned to you earlier, Dan's like, yeah, it's very obvious that the character you're playing is female, because they expect you to get all sappy and, you know, all sobby over your weighted companion cube being dead.
959980	960900	It's a cube!
962100	963280	I was like, you don't get it.
963820	969762	You can also tell your main character's a woman, because in the very beginning of the game, there's like a mirror, and you see that your character has boobs!
970122	970822	OMG boobs!
971122	971642	Well, he was...
972651	973071	and DarkSakura.
1001769	1004290	TheKingOfPortal11 What the hell is wrong with you people?
1005490	1006351	It's the cocaine.
1007011	1007251	Apparently.
1007271	1008131	It's a lot of cocaine.
1008151	1009732	Have we been giving out cocaine in chat?
1010552	1011232	Share, please.
1011732	1012292	No kidding.
1015413	1018815	Alright, well, moving on to other gaming news, then.
1019915	1020495	I don't wanna.
1020795	1021275	You have to.
1021796	1023376	Okay.
1025217	1028758	Lost Odyssey is supposed to...
1030737	1037801	It's actually going to be out on Xbox 360 as an exclusive RPG, and it has a release date of February 12th.
1038742	1040783	And downloadable content will be on its way.
1040803	1047447	Aren't I supposed to be able to get downloadable content for free if I pre-order or something?
1047887	1048868	I thought I read something about that.
1049588	1055272	It's actually saying that downloadable content will be made exclusive to anyone who pre-orders.
1055985	1063270	Oh, so I don't get free download content, I just get to... I get to pay more to have the download content if I pre-order.
1063330	1064491	Oh, okay, that would make more sense.
1064551	1065671	I would hope so.
1066432	1068173	They can use the codes and stuff, right?
1068593	1069834	Yeah, they'll give you codes.
1069854	1072055	That's what I would think.
1073556	1075257	I don't know if you've heard much about this game yet.
1075438	1076918	It didn't get very highly...
1078386	1081127	The reviews weren't that great on it in Japan.
1081167	1083787	The trailer looked really good.
1083807	1084127	It did.
1084187	1087888	But then I heard it did not get very well received over in Japan.
1088028	1089748	So that makes me a little less excited about it.
1090309	1094549	What's interesting though, which people might not know, is it's on four DVDs.
1095090	1097270	Just like Blue Dragon was on three.
1097650	1097970	Wow.
1099290	1100611	Go DVDs!
1100671	1101131	Yay!
1101171	1102751	Can't fit all that space on there.
1102771	1103871	So sad.
1103951	1105132	This game must be epic.
1105912	1106652	It's very epic.
1107277	1111540	Actually, sadly enough, I don't know what the game looked like, and that's not really a good point for it.
1111880	1116563	It kind of reminds me a little bit of... Oh, God, what is that game now?
1116583	1119305	I just had the name.
1119845	1121766	I don't know, you bought it.
1122507	1124408	It's like, not Phantasy Star.
1125229	1125529	99 Nights?
1125589	1126389	Not 99 Nights.
1127450	1128131	Enchanted Arms.
1128691	1129171	Oh, okay.
1129211	1131253	Yeah, that's not a good thing to be compared to.
1131733	1133954	Enchanted Arms wasn't horrible, it just wasn't great.
1136296	1136556	I don't know.
1137310	1140891	Mega Man Battle Network again, yay!
1165566	1166546	How about Mega Man Legends 3?
1167067	1169207	Haven't you guys been hankering for some of that for a while?
1170768	1171448	Fuck yeah.
1172008	1173628	Of course, they're never going to give that to us.
1175069	1179830	Some theories might be that Mega Man is going to be announced as an official character in Super Smash Bros.
1179910	1185671	Brawl, which I would think that would be covered on the daily updates on their stupid website.
1185711	1188332	I think they would have done it already, if that was true.
1190073	1191313	I was seeing right now
1192799	1202526	If there's any sort of update here, other than, well, Reina just says... I guess, four hours and four minutes?
1203227	1204488	I can't read Japanese, dammit!
1204888	1212354	But there's 0404, so either I got the wrong page... Which is entirely possible.
1213375	1214756	Happy birthday, Rockman.
1215296	1216317	Still looking like a chick.
1216957	1217157	Um...
1218670	1224535	Ross Steel UT in response to the whole Mega Man Legends 3.
1225315	1226716	Sky, Capcom can't do that.
1226836	1228357	That'd make Mega Man relevant again.
1229919	1230639	I guess that's true.
1231099	1232861	Jamie made a face at that comment.
1233441	1234562	What was that face about?
1234602	1235203	You made a face.
1235383	1236243	It was just a face.
1236824	1237104	I see.
1237604	1240086	It was an angry face or it was a grr face.
1240406	1242148	It was a face.
1242188	1242468	I see.
1243829	1244089	All right.
1244930	1245130	Well,
1245845	1247946	Now, I know this news ought to make Jamie happy.
1248126	1250927	This is something that will make Jamie very happy for Christmas.
1250967	1251428	But I don't know.
1251468	1251868	Maybe not.
1252788	1253869	Christmas nights.
1254569	1260532	You know, Jamie always talks about her annual tradition of putting the Saturn back up and playing some Christmas nights every year.
1260832	1268596	Well, maybe she won't have to anymore because it is going to be included in the PlayStation 2 remake of Nights into Dreams for the PlayStation 2.
1269716	1271317	It's going to have Christmas nights as well.
1271938	1275340	The bad news for Jamie, it's a Japan-only release, so she's going to have to pay more money to import it.
1275360	1277181	Like, that's a bad thing at all.
1277241	1278462	I've got a Japanese PlayStation 2.
1278502	1281404	I do have to admit, remember they said they weren't really remaking the game?
1281784	1283425	The graphics do look a little bit sharper.
1284326	1287228	Well, they probably went back and upgraded some things and cleaned some things up.
1287788	1291831	To also make another point, the Saturn did not have nearly the 3D capability...
1292561	1294502	that the PlayStation did.
1294962	1300223	And so being on the PlayStation 2, one would think that it has a better 3D processor than the Saturn would.
1300943	1303724	So it would have to be cleaner textures and that type of thing.
1303764	1311726	Yeah, but true, but then you also forget the fact that people like to slack off when they port games over and they'll just port them exactly the same for authentic purposes, you know.
1312846	1320068	I think even so, even if it was ported over just the same, it still has better, it'd be better capable of processing it, but.
1320549	1332815	Now, Jamie, it's not going to be as simple, unfortunately, as paying all the money to import the game, because not only are you going to have to do that, but then you have to beat Nights into Dreams, and then you will unlock Christmas Dreams.
1332835	1333735	Tell me how that's hard.
1336017	1338058	I'm just saying, you've got to put a little bit of work into it.
1338618	1340699	You might have to lift a finger, Jamie, to get to Christmas Dreams.
1340719	1343680	You know the hardest thing about that is going to be playing without getting motion sick.
1344701	1347302	Because Nights is another one of those games that makes me motion sick.
1348182	1348903	I got really sick...
1349824	1350925	I was playing Portal earlier.
1354066	1356008	Okay, Portal, write cake, attorney.
1356208	1358069	Okay, no more Portal jokes!
1358249	1358889	Jesus!
1359069	1360150	They are still going.
1360790	1361651	That's great.
1362431	1363032	Shut up!
1364032	1366574	Portal, write cake, attorney.
1366854	1369035	I'm leaving chat, so I don't have to read any more of that.
1369996	1370376	Lordy.
1370776	1375119	Chatroom, you're banned from commenting on our program for a little bit until you can calm down with the Portal stuff.
1375679	1376079	We'll see.
1376459	1377240	Portal combat.
1377260	1377840	If they can behave...
1380100	1383901	Alright, we'll see if they can behave during our next segment, the weekly mailbag segment.
1384361	1390622	Every week you send in your emails to mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com and we pick a few of our favorites to read right here on the air.
1391282	1397664	And Jamie will read them and we'll compliment you or we'll make fun of you or we'll answer your question or we'll sing a song and dance.
1397704	1399684	Who knows, it's unpredictable, it's the mailbag segment.
1400704	1403025	Jamie, open up ye olde mailbag.
1403516	1404537	and tell us what's in it this week.
1404777	1408639	I will be doing neither song nor dance just to make a point of order.
1408939	1411140	But if you'd like to, you can dance to the song playing in the background.
1411320	1412361	Those of you playing along at home.
1413282	1413782	No, you can't.
1414402	1415403	I'll pop my head.
1416704	1417484	First email!
1419725	1422627	From Riz, I guess is how it's pronounced.
1423267	1424568	Hi Rob, Jamie, and Matt.
1424908	1428910	This email was constructed for a number of reasons which are detailed below.
1429491	1432633	I would first like to say what a pleasure listening to your podcast has been.
1432753	1433233	All thank you.
1433806	1441073	I have enjoyed OR since around March and have been greatly entertained by your mix of news, banter, and general chaos.
1441613	1446638	I have been visually impaired since birth, but was able to play a number of video games when I was younger.
1446678	1452263	Due to a deterioration in my eyesight over the years, the number of games I can play is now greatly reduced.
1452893	1453714	Thank you for watching!
1474572	1481614	I find that most companies and stuff generally don't care if you use video game music and stuff.
1482054	1483315	It's promotion for them.
1484295	1484955	What do they care?
1485575	1492197	And I believe there's some type of fair use law out there or something that as long as you limit it to 30 seconds, you're fine.
1492597	1494058	Nobody can really sue you over it.
1494358	1497659	I mean, sure, the polite thing to do is ask and all that stuff, but
1498086	1504788	I think as long as you use, especially the old stuff, the old 8-bit stuff, which I know a lot of podcasts use for their openings and things, nobody's really going to care.
1505228	1505808	I think it's fine.
1506768	1508329	Next email.
1509729	1513570	I would like to thank Sky, DarkSakura, and Loki for hosting the best gaming podcast on the internet.
1514250	1516791	I just started listening a couple weeks ago and already I'm hooked.
1517271	1520091	I've already been scouring the internet for all the episodes I can download.
1520131	1521472	I listen to them on my PSP.
1521772	1522072	See?
1522785	1523765	More PSP listeners.
1523886	1525406	I said in Part A there were some.
1525546	1526167	They do exist.
1526247	1528468	And there's no better place for gaming news and humor.
1528668	1529488	One quick question, though.
1529608	1531749	Is there anywhere I can download previous episodes?
1532169	1536351	The RSS feed only goes back a few episodes, and there's about 250 more I can't find.
1537211	1539572	Thanks and screw Rockman for sucking so much online.
1539712	1540153	PKJr92
1541913	1550081	If you go to olrpsp.com, the parser over there actually goes back a few more episodes, which if you're listening on your PSP, you've probably already done.
1550121	1552283	You can go back about 20 episodes there.
1553384	1561671	Otherwise, we keep – I think some of the websites like Yahoo Podcasts, I want to say, and –
1563382	1564163	What about iTunes?
1564243	1565324	Podcast Alley.
1566545	1570950	The one on iTunes only goes back ten listings, which is about five episodes.
1570990	1580659	And the reason for that is to prevent what happened a few years ago to some podcasts is that this new application came out for the Xbox 360 called XB Stream.
1580679	1583442	And it's a great idea and a great application.
1583502	1586365	We're actually a default podcast that's on it when you put this thing in.
1586735	1599583	But for the default podcast that were on the very first version of it, what happened is that the program downloaded every single program from the feed, which for people that never cleaned up their feeds meant their server was getting hammered for like 100 downloads of big shows at once.
1600143	1607108	So we keep our feed tidy for that reason, so that if you use a grabber that does something like that where it gets all episodes of a show, you're limited to 10.
1607768	1608649	That's pretty much the reason we do it.
1608929	1611790	We only do server cleans about once every few months when we need the space.
1611931	1614212	Otherwise, if you want to find shows older than that,
1614682	1616423	Ask around the community, post on the forums.
1616623	1622285	I know there's one person out there that probably has every pre-podcast show we ever did.
1622305	1624146	I know there's at least one person out there that has that.
1624166	1626367	I don't even have that, to put it in perspective.
1626407	1627667	I've asked and haven't heard anything.
1628267	1635610	I have a lot, and we might put out some DVDs out there, but we can't do any big releases of it just because of some of the things.
1635931	1641073	We might have to do something kind of like under the table for the fans only because there was some copyright music, so we can't really sell it for profit.
1641953	1644434	But anything's a possibility in the near future, so we'll see.
1645411	1648013	There's also a funny quote on here from Loki.
1648213	1648473	Sure.
1648953	1650574	Friendship is like peeing on yourself.
1650695	1653096	Everyone can see it, but only you get the warm feeling it brings.
1654937	1655297	Wow.
1657078	1657279	Yeah.
1659240	1659840	To Skye.
1660941	1665524	I was wondering why every time G4 is brought up on the show, you moan and groan about how much you hate it.
1666424	1667185	I hate G4.
1667205	1667745	I hate G4.
1670262	1671883	It isn't that bad in my opinion.
1671943	1677407	The shows, such as Attack of the Show being my favorite, X-Play, Cheat, and Ninja Warrior are all awesome.
1677487	1684732	I can understand that a lot of people wish that it were more like it used to be when it was tech TV, but had a more gaming-oriented atmosphere to it.
1684953	1689316	Hell, I'm pissed that they took off icons and replaced it with crap like cheaters and cops.
1689736	1691257	But you shouldn't hate G4 completely.
1691317	1692538	It still has some great shows on it.
1692618	1693299	Thanks, Osfer.
1693919	1694219	P.S.
1694259	1696721	Have you guys seen the Zero Punctuation gaming reviews?
1696801	1697582	Here's a link to the site.
1697742	1699243	Oh, I have to see this.
1700149	1702030	That's some funny shit if you watch it every week.
1722558	1725980	It's nothing like it could have been with the whole tech TV merge and stuff.
1726020	1728362	And it just got too corporate and yucky.
1728402	1730323	And it's owned by E for God's sakes.
1730443	1731364	I mean, I don't know.
1731444	1737148	It's just everything that's kind of disturbing about corporate media is kind of like embodied in G4.
1737188	1738789	And that's why I just don't like it.
1740630	1742071	And I'm allowed not to like things.
1745934	1746374	Next email.
1747154	1747555	Hi, guys.
1747715	1747875	Yes.
1748672	1754076	I know you don't normally read FUs from listeners, but I was in a car accident yesterday, and I really wanted to vent somewhere.
1754477	1754817	Why not?
1755578	1763584	To the woman in the Jeep who tried to pass me by going onto the oncoming traffic while I was making a U-turn, a big fat FU.
1764044	1768208	This is on my last day of finals, and I was just about to go home from Davis, and I am pissed off.
1768688	1772091	I'm going to have to agree with Loki that women drivers in this area can't drive for anything.
1772191	1772832	It looks at me.
1772852	1774353	That would be me.
1775199	1778621	Unfortunately, everyone is okay, although my head slammed into the car door during the impact.
1779181	1784124	The only part of this is that since I won't have a car for a while, I'll be able to sit at home and play all the games I want over the break.
1784665	1792209	That being the case, what are your favorite games that came out this holiday season on any console, since I guess I'll be looking for something to pass the time.
1792730	1794991	Keep up the awesome show, I need something to keep my spirits up.
1795011	1796732	What an awesome way to start the holidays.
1797352	1798453	Happy Holidays, AZHP.
1799674	1799874	Portal!
1799894	1800034	Portal!
1801630	1805886	I don't want to give it all away because then I'd be basically giving you my favorite games of the year.
1807373	1808534	I will back up what Jamie said.
1808574	1813056	I think Orange Box in general is a very good investment.
1813196	1813956	Here's a thought though.
1814477	1816638	Use this period, this opportunity.
1816658	1819719	I'm glad you have such a positive attitude about it because it really sucks what happened.
1820039	1821460	I'm glad you have a good attitude about it.
1821900	1825862	Instead of necessarily having to play everything new that comes out, go back and play the shit you missed.
1826202	1830124	Because I bet there's a lot of stuff that you missed towards the end of last year amongst all the cons of madness.
1830164	1831344	I'll give you a great example for me.
1831364	1831705	Final Fantasy XII.
1832945	1841188	I did not get nearly as far in that game as I would have liked to because it was an amazing battle system in the game and I just never really got a chance to just play it the whole way through to completion.
1841228	1844070	That's one of those games I would like to complete one day when there's time.
1844130	1850492	So I would encourage you to actually take this opportunity to go revisit the past games and beat stuff you haven't yet that you wanted to.
1850772	1858996	You can go to Deliverance online and download Ragnarok online and play on the server with me and Ranma and join the OLR guild on there.
1859156	1859596	Yeah, there you go.
1859616	1860476	Join an MMO.
1860496	1861597	That'll suck up all your time.
1862017	1862497	There you have it.
1864338	1868160	The ACHP is actually in chat right now and says, I just finished 12 during finals week.
1869081	1869361	LOL.
1870201	1872943	How did you have time to beat a Final Fantasy game during finals?
1873443	1874684	Are you taking, like, home ec?
1875044	1875705	What is up with that?
1875745	1876505	Wow, that's amazing.
1876805	1877886	Hey, hey, hey, Rob.
1877986	1878386	What, what?
1879127	1883449	I actually, one of my finals weeks, I stayed up for three days and played D&D every night.
1883589	1884210	Oh, my God.
1884530	1885210	You guys are crazy.
1885250	1886551	I passed out on the fourth day.
1886651	1888912	I was kept alive by Jolt Cola and Pixie Stix.
1889112	1891514	Loki, any recommendations for our listener who's...
1893556	1896637	Handicapped for Winter Break for games to play while they're on Winter Break?
1898738	1902060	Well, Call of Duty 4 is pretty good, I guess.
1902280	1903280	Yeah, actually it is.
1904001	1907882	Halo 3, Super Mario Galaxy.
1910423	1912324	I don't know, you can play a ton of stuff.
1912344	1913325	There's tons of games out there.
1913945	1915746	Just play something you haven't played yet.
1916646	1917066	There you go.
1917347	1918407	RPGs, there you go.
1918427	1919948	We'll bring you a Nintendo.
1921107	1922527	and you can play classic stuff.
1922547	1923528	You can play Guardian Legend.
1923628	1923928	That's right.
1924088	1926948	Go back and play every Saturn game you didn't play previously.
1927328	1929249	Dear God, I don't have enough room for that.
1930289	1930789	Alright, anyhow.
1930849	1932249	I know what you should do.
1932369	1933850	Find me a copy of Burning Rangers.
1934750	1936310	Next email, please.
1937110	1939851	First of all, Merry early Christmas slash happy holidays.
1939891	1948433	I'm not sure if you're doing an episode for the 23rd and I don't think I can listen live on the 16th which as of this writing is today since I have a final exam the next day.
1948653	1949633	Oops, good luck on that.
1950353	1951695	This is from GS68, by the way.
1953077	1955440	Who happens to be in chat, by the way, so I guess he found a way.
1955520	1955741	Yeah.
1959634	1960855	Me regarding fellow gamers.
1961295	1975781	On sites like GamePolitics, Facebook, and especially GameSpy, there are gamers who are quick to get angry and defensive about their games whenever Dr. Phil, whose comment on game usage, not games, being a problem was, in my opinion, a step in the right direction.
1976361	1981603	Although many people who commented on the story just saw the name Dr. Phil and immediately thought, oh my god, it's Dr. Phil, he sucks horse.
1982624	1982704	Uh...
1983465	1986407	JT censorship, and school shootings show up.
1986907	1994371	In fact, I see comments along the lines of, I hope JT gets his ass kicked so hard he goes sterile, and worse, maybe Microsoft will hire a drifter and kill him.
1996172	2003435	It's rather ironic that there are gamers who oppose the idea that video games make people violent-minded and then go on wishing death upon Jackie Poo.
2004056	2007577	I dislike JT as much as the next gamer, especially his reaction to gamers' email.
2007918	2010539	The Flowers for Jack project and its outcome are a prime example.
2011107	2012489	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2032350	2036673	Those kinds of personal attacks make us gamers look bad in front of people supportive of video game censorship.
2037153	2050523	And if we need to get sent to Bullworth Academy, no, as if we need to get sent to Bullworth Academy, is this kind of defensiveness and immaturity that also led to the creation of the otaku stereotype.
2050963	2054926	And I'm a gamer and an anime slash manga fan, so facepalm.
2056658	2060741	and with all of that said, I wish the three of you and any guests also in the studio a great holiday.
2060822	2061902	Don't die in a car fire.
2062343	2063744	Yours truly, GS68.
2063784	2064765	We'll try, thanks.
2065145	2065566	P.S.
2065726	2068088	Are you three going to SAC Anime this January?
2068448	2072692	I'm hoping to go and it would be great to see you guys there since I didn't get a chance to go to last summer's SAC Anime.
2074353	2076194	Oh God, I didn't realize there was one in January too.
2076275	2076775	I forgot about it.
2076795	2077516	We should try to do a panel.
2077676	2079357	I gotta get in touch with Jonas about that.
2079657	2080258	We're gonna try and go.
2082214	2083394	It's not at 8 in the morning.
2083414	2085136	We're not going again if our panel's at 8 in the morning.
2085156	2086317	But if we can get something better, we'll go.
2086497	2090680	I probably won't cosplay unless it's my Organization 13 costume.
2093242	2094683	Last email.
2095284	2096285	From Cheeseburger.
2097806	2099047	Who signed it with a question mark.
2099407	2100248	I can ask Cheeseburger?
2101108	2101809	This is Cheeseburger.
2102609	2103530	Hey, OLR crew.
2103750	2108094	I have been listening to your podcast for almost a year and a half now, and I think it's great.
2108454	2109195	You're still with us?
2109255	2109455	Cool.
2110416	2113078	I have also listened live and interacted in chat a few times too.
2113118	2119482	The reason for this email is to ask Rob about Civilization 3, which I purchased for my new computer on his recommendation.
2119862	2121503	What's your perspective on that game?
2122043	2127026	And I also chose Russia because I thought I could make nuclear weapons and blow everything up.
2127587	2130188	The only other PC games I have are StarCraft and Black and White 2.
2131029	2135952	By the way, Loki's comment about having a washer and dryer so he could now piss himself with joy was hilarious.
2136593	2140016	Another email comment, Olive Garden Home of the Neverending Salads was funny too.
2140637	2140917	P.S.
2141057	2143840	I think Rob is rad and Kmart sucks lols.
2144981	2146222	I think cheeseburgers are rad.
2146741	2147962	I like cheeseburgers in paradise.
2172611	2174552	But, of course, there are multiple ways to win the game.
2174792	2179935	I think you get the most points for being the first person in space, but that's not nearly as fun as Global Dominantization.
2180636	2187079	My favorite thing to do in Civilization is I like to treat everybody really nice, and, you know, I'm like, oh, sure, we'll trade with you.
2187139	2188480	Let's sign a peace treaty.
2188900	2189701	Oh, we love you.
2190141	2196725	And then I will, you know, take a bunch of army units, like, right outside their city, and then I'll, you know, nuke the shit out of them.
2197125	2198246	We actually got one last email.
2198566	2198966	Oh, goody.
2199146	2201868	That we got last minute, and I'm going to read it, and
2202778	2207961	It's not signed, so I'm just going to say it's from G. Davis, I guess.
2208061	2208302	Okay.
2209062	2209822	LOLR.
2210143	2216547	After listening to your guys' and Jamie's thoughts on DDR on last week's show, I cannot help but feel like I need to say I completely agree.
2217167	2219488	DDR hasn't changed drastically since 6th Mix.
2219909	2224091	However, 7th Mix is my favorite mix and will always be Smile Face.
2224151	2229114	The thing that made DDR so much fun to play was the cheesy Dance Mania pop that was in it.
2231204	2239752	After seeing the list of licensed songs in the arcade version of Supernova 2, I have to say that I am not excited for it because a lot of it is shitty mainstream music.
2240093	2242295	Linkin Park and DDR equals WTF.
2243276	2245358	The same goes for the home versions.
2245698	2250423	Most casual gamers end up thinking Guitar Hero is the best rhythm game because it has real songs in it, in quotes.
2251297	2258743	and when they heard that the home version of Supernova 2 had Britney Spears, Gwen Stefani and Justin Timberlake, they said Guitar Hero had good real music.
2259144	2264208	However, they also said that Captain Jack, Cartoon Heroes and most of the other Dance Mania tracks were some of their favorite songs in DDR.
2264769	2268512	I don't think this crappy mainstream pop is appealing to anyone except for 12-year-old girls.
2269421	2271903	Also, Rob, what innovations would you put in DDR?
2271943	2274145	Because I've always been curious as to what they are.
2274605	2279129	One of my favorite things about DDR is the sheer simplicity of it, so anybody could jump in and play.
2279249	2281731	I think too many changes might ruin that part of DDR.
2283133	2286576	Well, I've said this a million times on the show, but I know you might be a newer listener or what have you.
2286596	2288757	We've been doing the show a long time, so it feels like a million.
2288777	2290659	But I think the best way they could innovate DDR...
2291212	2294894	is that right now the way DDR is, it has a lot of cooperative modes in the game.
2295475	2301098	There's a lot of cooperative dancing, a lot of cooperative... I think the way for DDR to innovate is to make it more of a competitive game.
2301379	2303960	And that way tournaments can be based more around the competition element.
2304000	2311525	Now, yes, I understand there's Dance Magic in DDR Disney, and I believe there was a mode similar to it in some of the later home versions that they did for DDR.
2311585	2317369	However, these versions have always been like add-ons or tack-ons and not the focus of the game itself.
2317850	2323832	and I think there ought to be some type of like dance battle or something that the game could kind of focus on.
2324892	2327333	You know, kind of taking some ideas and innovating from that.
2327513	2331074	Is that maybe even in one player mode you do battle against the computer.
2331395	2338037	I mean, that's how games like Busta Groove worked is that, you know, you were always kind of battling somebody else to see who was the better dancer.
2338317	2339557	And they did it better in the second one.
2339717	2347380	Yeah, and I think that could be a new direction for DDR where they could innovate yet keep the core element of the game stomping on arrows the same.
2347700	2349021	Second Mix had it.
2350202	2350682	Dance Battle.
2365034	2370436	Having some of the mainstream stuff is nice, but I think, you know, the Dance Mania stuff is always where it was at.
2370456	2371317	And a different drum, too.
2371397	2371937	Can't forget them.
2372317	2376899	But, boy, I really ruffled some feathers in my comments last week, though, from some of the hardcore DDR people.
2376979	2378039	I've seen a few comments.
2379060	2380981	Unfortunately, I stand by what I said.
2381021	2385202	I know it's tough to hear, but... Super DDR Fighter 2 Turbo.
2386083	2389964	It's time for DDR to innovate or... Eliminate?
2390004	2390484	Go away.
2390764	2391865	I hate to say that, but...
2392691	2394092	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2418365	2428730	You will be able to send virtual console games to friends on your friends list, barring that you have their Wii friend code.
2429511	2432932	But you can gift wonderful virtual console games.
2433453	2440736	So I'm sure once Guardian Legend comes out, you'll have 30 copies of Guardian Legend coming to you from all your friends.
2440916	2442177	I have no problem with this.
2444574	2446475	No word, though, and I haven't heard about this before.
2446515	2448115	What happens if you already have the game?
2448496	2449456	I guess you're just out of luck.
2450857	2451277	Perhaps.
2451677	2452057	I don't know.
2452657	2462681	Or, well... No, I want to say I have heard that what happens if you already have the game is that you actually can't send the game to your friend.
2462962	2466983	Like, when you try to gift it to them, it'll just bounce back and say you can't gift this because they already have it.
2467383	2468284	Or something along those lines.
2468304	2469144	Well, that's kind of cool, then.
2469624	2469884	Yeah.
2471065	2473686	I can't guarantee that, though, but I'm pretty sure that's what I read.
2474179	2475180	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2502183	2505405	If you're feeling cheap this Christmas, gift free things to your friends.
2506206	2506586	It's fun.
2509208	2509869	I like free.
2510869	2512731	I think you want to watch the Metroid Channel.
2513531	2514372	The Metroid Channel.
2515693	2518115	I would watch the Metroid Channel if that were a real TV channel.
2519196	2525140	Well, there is a little bit of news for people who like stuff on their iPhone.
2527422	2529084	Is that like stuff on my cat?
2529524	2529604	No.
2531201	2532902	It's as in emulation.
2533342	2539024	They are in the beta stage, well, near the beta stage, I should say, for an iPhone PS1 emulator.
2539965	2546888	And it's called PSX for number four iPhone emulator.
2547348	2553471	They're still working on it, but hopefully they'll have something out soon for all of you who want to do it.
2553491	2559754	But they say that their goal is to have it 75% compatible with all of the...
2562037	2565599	I'd have to say it's compatible with 75% of the list of PS1 games that are out.
2568100	2569781	Hey, that'd be nice, but you know what?
2569981	2572983	I'm not going to download it unless something that Apple puts out.
2573984	2577926	Rosto UT in chat says, unless you can plug a controller in the iPhone, do not want...
2579213	2598989	Looking at the screen for this that they have on here, and I'll go ahead and link that in the chat room, they've got D-pads and your trigger buttons on the screen itself sort of running behind the game stuff itself.
2599069	2602232	So that still doesn't... I don't think it's going to work.
2602932	2605514	So I don't think that it'll be very playable.
2606595	2607856	The Nintendo one, I understand.
2607916	2608677	It actually was okay.
2609318	2610219	Nintendo one looks rad.
2610239	2615183	If I had an iPhone, I'd do it, except for the fact that, you know, then Apple will put the curse of death on my phone, probably.
2615203	2616304	Yeah, I don't want to brick my phone.
2616384	2617085	Well, exactly.
2617105	2619247	You already have the curse of death if you have an iPhone anyway.
2619547	2620067	Shut up.
2620708	2622069	I haven't had a single problem with mine.
2623991	2624531	Oh, shiz.
2624651	2625532	All right, more news.
2625992	2627834	Less Apple debate, more news.
2629736	2632318	Anyways, let's see here.
2634259	2641564	Uh, there's gonna be some new maps, apparently, for Team Fortress 2 coming, as well as some more fixes, uh, cause you can't fix that game enough.
2642364	2646587	But, um, that's kinda cool that they're having new maps, cause I remember before, they only had, like, what, three maps?
2646887	2647528	So that kinda sucks.
2648128	2663458	But now, um, let's see here, they're talking about some different, uh, fixes that they're gonna be having, including several gameplay exploits, plus other stuff to improve, uh, bandwidth usage, and, um, improve stats reporting, and I guess some menu bugs.
2664904	2667865	They didn't really say, though, what the different levels are going to be yet.
2669146	2672307	But I'm sure we'll find that out soon, because I don't think it's officially been announced.
2674588	2676588	What are you freaking out about over there, DarkSakura?
2677389	2681510	I was looking at Valve's website, and they have Aperture Science cups.
2682111	2682771	And I do want one.
2686452	2691114	It's funny, because all the passion she had for DDR at one time, she now has for Portal.
2691154	2691734	It's amazing.
2692034	2693715	You know what would be fucking awesome?
2693775	2694015	What?
2694597	2699322	Like, you know how they have those stupid little, um, you know, light-censored things?
2699762	2703847	You know, like the stupid frogs and stuff that you walk in front of and they rib it at you and stuff?
2704167	2708631	They need one of those sentry guns or whatever, so when you walk past it's all, Hello!
2709372	2710233	Who's there?
2711214	2715819	You know, and do all that stuff and pop up and... We need to make that happen.
2716119	2716840	That'd be pretty sweet.
2717105	2717766	W00T is the word of the year
2741004	2742725	I don't think I need to define what Woot means.
2742805	2745207	Most gamers know Woot is like a celebration thing.
2745227	2748749	And I'm just thinking, I always think about Woot.com too, the store.
2749049	2749529	You know what they have?
2749569	2753111	This is going to be great business for them to be the guy that owns Woot.com right now.
2753692	2757194	The runner up, by the way, was Facebook, but using it as a verb.
2757254	2758635	Like you're going to Facebook somebody.
2759155	2763438	But I always thought saying you were going to MySpace somebody was a more popular verb to use.
2763738	2764979	I just say friend somebody.
2765279	2765519	Really?
2765539	2767720	Yeah, I think that's a good thing to say.
2768421	2768521	Okay.
2769485	2771106	Turn a noun into a verb.
2796981	2798863	We're totally independent, but we're owned by Sony.
2799363	2804607	Apparently, LittleBigPlanet and Killzone 2 are not coming out until September or October next year.
2805128	2809872	That's a pretty big difference from early 2008, which was the original time for LittleBigPlanet.
2810132	2814635	But then again, pushback should be no new news to Sony, or really gaming in general.
2814656	2816517	It wouldn't be fair to pick on Sony in that department.
2816817	2818639	Hello, Super Smash Bros.
2818699	2820200	Brawl, right?
2821921	2826205	But it just kind of sucks for sales because, again, without really, really killer applications...
2827861	2830523	PlayStation 3's aren't going to move off-shells any faster.
2831063	2852596	Well, no, all the stuff that they're promising us, you know, that was supposed to be coming out so people would buy these systems, you know, I'm sure you've seen the trailers for, like, the third-party stuff that they have for PlayStation 3 now, where they're advertising Metal Gear Solid 4, like, it's out right now, even though it doesn't come out until, what, like, shit, I don't even know, they haven't officially announced it yet, probably, like, March-ish, so...
2853332	2855273	Quick clarifications from our chat room.
2855613	2860616	Ross Steel UT says three speeches, Sony Europe, Sony USA is PlayStation.blog.
2861997	2862437	Well, fine.
2863638	2865218	But it's still Sony, no matter what country you're in.
2865238	2866338	Well, if that's the case, then who knows?
2866358	2871659	You know, LittleBigPlanet and Killzone being delayed to, like, the fall, you know, Europe's always getting the shaft.
2871699	2877640	That's true, Europe always gets the shaft in that department, but I don't know, even... That's a long shaft.
2877720	2881501	If they're not getting them until the end of the year, and we're getting them at the beginning of the year.
2881621	2882801	Well, here's the thing I want to know.
2883181	2886562	I'm not sure if SingStar is already out now in Europe.
2886602	2889142	I know it's not here for the PlayStation 3, at least.
2889362	2892863	Maybe they're just having trouble with, like, their network infrastructure or something like that, because...
2894038	2903669	Home, SingStar, this little big planet that's going to have a lot of network backend stuff is not coming out.
2904190	2907794	Is it sad that I kind of sort of want a PlayStation 3 for SingStar?
2908956	2912737	Yes, it is sad, seeing as there's countless versions for the PlayStation 2.
2913377	2914897	Why the fuck do you need the PlayStation 3 version?
2914917	2916598	Because of the whole, like, I know my friends.
2916618	2918218	Oh, because you can upload videos to YouTube.
2918238	2919318	Yes, and I want to do that to my friends.
2919338	2922899	Yeah, because we never upload videos to any other site.
2923099	2924700	It's just like uploading videos to YouTube.
2924840	2925500	Well, how about this?
2925740	2928421	Why don't you actually upload videos to YouTube?
2928681	2929061	Guess what?
2929121	2930341	It's free to do that.
2931081	2932642	Instead of having to buy a game.
2932862	2933922	Oh, fine, shut up.
2936269	2938770	Why don't you buy, you know, fucking SingStar right now?
2938810	2940411	Because, hell, you get the microphones.
2940431	2941652	They work with the PlayStation 3.
2942133	2944374	Seprock1215 says, Rob, just play Rock Band.
2944414	2946395	Ironically enough, I was playing Rock Band last night.
2946455	2952159	One of my friends was filming me, and I wouldn't be surprised if that shit ended up on MySpace TV or YouTube or any of that stuff.
2952239	2955041	But I hope not, because I look like an idiot when I play Rock Band.
2955361	2956242	Especially the singing.
2956562	2957363	I was horrible.
2958083	2958463	Horrible.
2958483	2960004	Because none of those songs are in my key.
2960225	2961005	I would just like to share.
2962246	2962346	So.
2964255	2966216	It was hard to play the drums and listen to that.
2966236	2967017	She's fucking hardcore, I love it.
2993502	2994463	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3023082	3036770	Um, and actually this is sort of, well, it's old news if they're on your, um, DeviantArt friends list, but, um, uh, Udon Crew has been, um, working on, uh, new Street Fighter comics.
3037490	3039171	And they have been for quite some time.
3039251	3046535	Um, in 2008 there's a Street Fighter II Turbo comic that is to be out and I really, really love the work that Udon Crew has done on this.
3046895	3048716	They're also bringing out, though, um,
3049204	3077720	a lot of the different comics that are from overseas but they're also doing a Street Fighter Legends one that's different focus comics on different ones they're also doing a one for Street Fighter 3 they're also bringing out some of the other collections that came out overseas like the
3078884	3086086	They've been doing Sakura Ganbaru, which I read a long time ago in scans, but it's pretty cool.
3088526	3088906	Alrighty.
3089386	3090006	Pretty cool.
3093587	3101068	Yeah, you can also go on DeviantArt and you can add Udon to your friends list, and I'll get the name in a sec.
3101469	3101709	Alright.
3103189	3103669	Let's see here.
3104375	3107637	Now, there's some interesting news coming out about Grand Theft Auto 4.
3108557	3114520	They've rated it in Australia already, MA15+, which is good for two reasons.
3114780	3119882	One, it's not going to be adults only over there at least, and I know a lot of games get banned in Australia.
3120922	3131467	Two, the fact that it's actually been rated, first off, may indicate that it's actually coming out soon, and possibly within the time frame that they had originally said, which was April 1st.
3131849	3141217	Although, the other thing, 3 Speech, I believe, said that Grand Theft Auto 4 was coming out around the same time as Killzone 2 and LittleBigPlanet.
3141297	3142858	So, let's hope that's not true.
3143218	3145720	Let's hope it's actually coming out before holiday 2008.
3147021	3148563	Go spring release, come on.
3149383	3150304	I need to play this game.
3152986	3153767	I found it, by the way.
3153787	3154047	What's that?
3154087	3157089	It's udoncrew.dvnart.com There it is.
3157450	3161313	I find a lot of their art wallets in progress, too.
3162307	3163809	We'll save the last minute stories.
3163850	3165612	That is going to do it for our news tonight.
3165993	3166934	And you know what that means.
3166974	3170320	It's time to open up the telephones and let you guys have a say.
3170360	3173284	If you'd like to give us a call, it's 1-877-GAME-OLR.

3175748	3177551	We've been doing the Skype thing for a long time.
3178015	3179376	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3203837	3204978	Good, good, good.
3205678	3211142	Last week I went to my final anime con of the year, and I have some gaming stuff for you.
3212043	3212403	Really?
3212483	3213484	You got me stuff?
3214705	3216667	Yeah, I mean, just some gaming information.
3216747	3223732	It's not much, because I was working the whole weekend, because my roommate has a company now, so I was helping him peddle his wares.
3225073	3225513	Cool.
3225533	3226534	Well, what kind of stuff?
3227695	3233239	Well, first off, I was talking to a couple of people that were running the gaming room at New York Anime Fest,
3233800	3251844	and things were a little bit different they wanted to be different from normal gaming rooms so there would no be money there this year including no rock band or guitar or guitar hero or anything like that good for them taking a stand because honestly most of the people that go to those cons have all that shit at home don't they?
3253164	3260486	pretty much so there you go they had more like more anime based games and other RPGs and stuff
3260990	3264872	but there was a couple of instances that did happen in the game room from what I was told.
3268133	3276897	A DS got stolen with a game that was in development and some other guy tried to steal another DS but he got caught in doing it.
3278057	3281398	You know that DS game in development is going to be up on the internet any day now.
3281598	3282819	Probably already up there.
3283559	3285600	Yeah, the thing is I don't even know which game it was.
3286240	3286821	Interesting.
3289022	3289422	Also,
3290555	3296278	While I was there, I was working for a couple other websites, and one of my friends runs a site called Gaming Angel.
3296358	3301580	So I was running around getting pictures of female cosplayers doing gaming stuff.
3302220	3309123	I could tell you the most popular gaming cosplayers were pretty much Yuna from Final Fantasy X and Final Fantasy X-2.
3310544	3311744	That's kind of not a surprise.
3311784	3315346	I've seen a lot of Yunas of all shapes and sizes at anime cons.
3316428	3318049	Jamie, this next picture is for you.
3318089	3318249	Okay.
3343223	3345004	The second picture is a person cosplaying knights.
3345124	3348966	And this next one is a picture of something you probably enjoyed when I sent it to your cell phone.
3349006	3351328	This is my friend dressed up as Pit from Smash Brothers Brawl.
3370614	3374777	I got a random text message from Ranma over the weekend with the lady dressed as Pit.
3375217	3376038	That's hardcore, though.
3376058	3376578	I like that.
3377379	3377899	Good for her.
3378100	3378900	I hope she won something.
3380421	3382703	I'm not sure, but I can always ask because she's a good friend of mine.
3383024	3388508	And I know Jamie is a big fan of Silent Hill, so I found a girl who did Pyramid Head.
3389208	3390069	That's cool, yeah.
3392531	3395874	And the last two pictures, I've got to say, are my personal favorites.
3397095	3397855	You like Final Fight?
3398416	3398636	Oh, yeah.
3398676	3398836	Yeah.
3399338	3401399	I've got like almost every version that they put out at home.
3402640	3406582	Well, there's this guy walking around with a shirt that says, I got 08 on the front.
3408444	3415588	And on the back, it says, and I quote, a turkey in every oral drum and a fist in every face.
3416048	3416388	Yes.
3417809	3418470	That was great.
3419610	3420571	That's great.
3423194	3424535	I like how it's just some dude.
3424595	3427617	It's just some dude wearing this shirt like, yeah, I got my Hager 08 shirt.
3427857	3430258	A turkey in every oil drum and a fist in every face.
3430358	3431239	That's amazing.
3433980	3434740	I want that shirt.
3434780	3435661	He should market that.
3436381	3438382	Some other folks in chat are saying they want that shirt too.
3438543	3439663	That shirt is fantastic.
3440824	3444146	Well, since the pic is outposted, maybe I'll end up hearing from the guy.
3444166	3445947	I could find out more information about the shirt.
3445967	3448188	I have a feeling he made it himself, which is pretty damn cool.
3449790	3458797	You know, I was just thinking, you know, at Orange Lounge Radio, we should open a t-shirt shop and not just sell official Orange Lounge Radio t-shirts, like, finally, but really funny gamer nerd shirts, such as that.
3458878	3463421	Now, I mean, obviously, we wouldn't steal that idea, but we could come up with other things that are just as funny, right?
3463762	3469446	Like, we should get a shirt that says, Rate Me Pyramid Head on it, and, like, a little, with a little chibi pyramid head on it.
3469586	3471108	I mean, I'd wear that in public, wouldn't you?
3472629	3473390	I definitely would.
3473590	3473830	See?
3473850	3478554	I mean, I just, I just ran across this shirt, um, early, this weekend that said Mario Luigi, oh, wait.
3480762	3483243	And by the way, patent pending on the Rate Me Pyramid Head shirt.
3483263	3485243	If you steal that idea, I'll sue you for a million dollars.
3486743	3487343	We have proof.
3487363	3488184	It's being recorded.
3488384	3488864	Exactly.
3489584	3489844	All right.
3489904	3491564	Well, Ranma, anything else you want to share with our listeners?
3491584	3492744	I'm glad to hear you had fun at the con.
3493765	3494265	I'm glad.
3494605	3495885	That's pretty much it.
3496185	3501346	And we want the New York chapter of OLR, I want you guys to come out to anime next.
3501386	3504007	And we're working with some friends to try to get you guys out of here.
3504527	3505107	When is that?
3506763	3509025	I believe it's the first or second weekend of June.
3509065	3510506	They just announced their date.
3510786	3512308	Just in time for my birthday.
3513769	3515670	Hey, if you make it out for your birthday, we'll take you out.
3515730	3518452	I mean, I celebrated my birthday with you guys for Father May.
3518492	3519693	It's only fair, you know.
3519893	3521755	And speaking of which, are you coming back this year?
3521775	3523576	Because I do believe we were promised Ranma in 08.
3525377	3525998	I thought I said 09.
3527098	3529520	I think it was 09 every other year.
3529640	3530941	I was trying to switch it up.
3531222	3531902	That's right.
3532763	3533023	All right.
3534451	3535352	Have a good one, Ranma.
3535372	3535952	Thanks for calling.
3535972	3537113	Bye-bye, guys.
3537133	3537553	Take care.
3537654	3537994	Bye-bye.
3539095	3542277	DMN says Roberts and Summers in 08 would be the ticket.
3542898	3544319	I don't know what that leaves Loki to do.
3544399	3546921	Loki would have to be the official... He's Secretary of State.
3546961	3547942	Well, he's Court Jester.
3548922	3549423	That's what he is.
3549703	3550784	He can be Speaker of the House.
3554167	3557589	Actually, he can be the pet at the White House, like Socks the Cat.
3557629	3558170	We have Loki.
3558590	3558870	I don't know.
3559411	3560512	Anyway, we've got another caller.
3560532	3560832	Jeremy!
3562261	3563322	Show me who's the official pet.
3563342	3563382	GS68.
3563402	3563743	Good point.
3563763	3564143	The ferret.
3583052	3584073	We don't know where the ferret is.
3584113	3587275	The ferret will not stab you in the face and in fact cannot speak.
3587456	3588597	The ferret is MIA.
3589277	3591038	And now we should sell shirts with ferrets on them.
3591319	3592279	And it's just a ferret.
3592720	3593841	Actually, I think I've seen that before.
3593901	3594781	Never mind, we can't do that.
3595062	3595742	I don't want to get sued.
3597043	3597684	What's on your mind?
3598024	3599385	Certainly you have something game related.
3600486	3605490	Yeah, today I went to the GameStop Tournament Edition, which is what I like to call it.
3607051	3610454	Oh, you've been to the new place that we were talking about earlier in the program.
3610474	3611235	What was it like?
3611735	3612696	What was up with it?
3613707	3618628	Uh, first, there's a buttload of kiosks over there where you can, like, play games and such.
3620429	3628891	Like, over in the house where you normally buy games and stuff, you can... They also have a bunch of kiosks over there.
3631031	3641734	Um, now, did it look like a normal GameStop otherwise, or just a bunch of additional kiosks, or... Well... Actually, no, because, like, they had this big stage where...
3642449	3648212	There's a whole bunch of gaming kiosks, and I presume that's for tournaments and stuff.
3650233	3650734	Actually, no.
3651294	3652835	It was a regular day.
3652855	3653035	Yeah.
3653115	3654035	Yeah, I guess.
3654056	3654176	Yeah.
3669895	3676962	Yes, I was driving down Stevens Creek and what caught my attention was the subtitle under the GameStop logo by Barnes & Noble.
3678503	3680045	Where exactly is this GameStop located?
3680965	3687191	It's on the corner of San Tomas Expressway and Stevens Creek Boulevard in San Jose.
3687592	3688593	Oh shit, I know where that is.
3688673	3689133	That's funny.
3689313	3689574	Huh.
3690555	3695259	I might have to check that out at some point because I go to... It's right next to the Barnes & Noble.
3696382	3697723	Yeah, I kind of know where that is.
3697803	3699284	I go down that area quite often.
3699304	3702725	I go to Menlo Park almost every other week, so I might have to check that out.
3703205	3703765	Very cool.
3705166	3708568	All right, well, anything else you want to share with our listeners after your trip today?
3710128	3710348	No.
3711109	3714210	All right, well, have a good one and thanks for the first-hand report from being down there.
3715090	3715631	Thanks, you too.
3715791	3716351	All right, take care.
3717503	3717743	I like fire.
3717763	3718103	That's not news.
3741005	3747630	Well, there's apparently a possibility that an 18 plus version of No More Heroes may actually happen in the future for Europe.
3747990	3750933	So fear not, you may get your uncut version of the game.
3752874	3755797	There's a funny little Wiimote candy dispenser that's out there now.
3755877	3758739	If you go to candyaddict.com
3761260	3763341	You can buy a Wiimote candy dispenser.
3763421	3766941	Perfect gift for those kids who may not be able to get a Wii this Christmas.
3767562	3770962	Give them an IOU and a Wii candy dispenser.
3771062	3772343	What a shitty alternative.
3772643	3773303	Let's go to the phones.
3773323	3773923	We have another call.
3773963	3774983	Hi, you're on Orange Haunts Radio.
3775003	3775363	Who's this?
3776444	3778404	Hello, this is RossDLUT.
3778884	3780305	Hello, RossDLUT.
3780345	3781085	What is on your mind?
3782785	3783365	Not much.
3783725	3790167	I was looking at the November NPDs a few days ago and it's
3790788	3794150	Pretty damn shocking to see how well some of these games have turned out.
3794190	3797111	I mean, Call of Duty 4 has just been ridiculous.
3797992	3799833	You know, it's just been a lot of sales.
3800373	3809638	The one thing that's been on my mind, and I mentioned this earlier in the chat, is that, yeah, it's great that the Wii is selling all this hardware, but is it really growing a market?
3809918	3815180	You know, I mean, you look at all these games that are found, and there's a lot of good, you know, third-party games.
3815581	3817521	It's not like there's nothing on there, you know what I mean?
3817602	3817842	Right.
3818822	3820083	But it's like nothing has found a...
3821294	3822075	Thank you for watching.
3822095	3823075	See you next time.
3828886	3831348	The same people buying the same four games over and over again.
3831528	3834630	I think there are a shitload of people that are buying the system just for Wii Sports.
3834790	3839955	I mean, because that's the game that Nintendo's been very good at getting out there and kind of creating a fad out of.
3840015	3845700	I don't know if the fad is necessarily... I mean, think about the way most people think about video games in their mind.
3846400	3855548	A lot of folks don't even realize that this thing is a system capable of playing a multitude of games, but the way that it's been marketed to the soccer moms and everything is as Wii Sports...
3856275	3858076	Get up and move your butt while you play games.
3858196	3860798	Play fake tennis and all that stuff.
3860978	3863120	They've done an amazing job in that regard.
3864280	3868343	The question is, I mentioned Zack and Wiki in the chat.
3868383	3869964	I mentioned No More Heroes.
3871165	3876528	Even Rayman 2 has been doing pretty well, but not anywhere near as good as the first one, which was Launch Titles.
3876649	3879510	Launch Titles always have a lucky streak.
3881672	3882632	If all we're getting is...
3884239	3886456	is people buying it for Wii Sports I mean...
3887583	3890986	Is it ever going to be anything more than just a toy, basically?
3891026	3895109	Is it ever going to be anything that anyone who actually wants more than one game is going to want to have?
3895529	3900313	I do, because I think Nintendo is going to try to make Wii Fit the next fad.
3901573	3907438	My gut tells me the way Nintendo's been going with the market lately, I think they are really going to try and make Wii Fit massive.
3907458	3917025	They're going to try and get it out there on the Today Show, and on Oprah and all that shit, and that's going to be their next thing that they're going to push and try to get in every home.
3918157	3920539	Yeah, I mean, oh, I expect Wii Fit to do well.
3920579	3923441	I mean, all these little stupid little fitness products always do well.
3924282	3929266	The question I'm asking is, I mean, you see the 360s, even the PS3 to some extent.
3929306	3932529	The PS3 had a few good-selling games this month.
3932589	3940556	I mean, is it ever going to be where the Wii is a vibrant market, or is it just going to continue to be hostile to everybody who is a Nintendo?
3942898	3943738	You know, that's the...
3945151	3946331	That's the real question.
3947152	3955454	You mentioned, of course, movie games and all that, but a lot of people don't even look at the movie games.
3956255	3956795	It's shocking.
3956955	3960196	Even traditional high-selling games.
3960236	3962777	I was talking to this guy a couple of weeks ago.
3962937	3969259	EA butted heads with Nintendo so they could put the 32 multiplayer online in Medal of Honor Heroes 2.
3970578	3978681	They had the Madden Online for 08, where it works with EA Nation instead of the friend codes, and they're not being rewarded.
3978821	3981202	I mean, the third parties are trying, you know, some of them.
3982902	3984983	And of course, No More Heroes is a tragedy.
3987804	3990705	Well, but that... Has that even been released here yet?
3990885	3991205	Which one?
3991546	3991966	No More Heroes?
3992026	3993806	It was released in Japan.
3993866	3997388	Kotaku had a piece on it a couple of weeks ago, where...
3998567	4002450	Suda51 actually went to a huge game store in Akihabara.
4002850	4003451	Nobody went there.
4003951	4005392	He was going to go to sign games.
4005732	4008494	Piles of toilet paper that you could buy or get for free.
4008534	4009195	Yeah, the toilet paper.
4009335	4011817	They were giving the toilet paper away.
4011837	4012798	They had a model.
4012818	4015620	It was a big launch event and nobody came.
4017921	4019002	That just made me sad.
4019783	4020163	Really.
4021604	4022425	It's not just that game.
4022465	4023465	It's Zack and Wiki.
4023565	4023706	It's
4024625	4027007	I mean, one of my favorite games, Mercury Meltdown Revolution.
4027027	4028427	I don't think that sold very well.
4029008	4030409	Look at the box art for that game.
4030449	4033371	That isn't something that really jumps out at you as something you should buy.
4034251	4035032	What, Zack and Wiki?
4035612	4037333	No, the Mercury Meltdown Revolution.
4037813	4039915	Yeah, Mercury Meltdown.
4039935	4046979	I could see it was Mercury Meltdown, but Zack and Wiki, I mean, that's... I mean, that's... screams family-friendly.
4048040	4049721	It's a very adorable-looking game.
4049801	4052483	It's not that hard.
4053383	4054044	You know, I mean...
4055160	4055921	Virtual Console Sales
4073527	4080351	because I bet that's doing crazy business that if we saw the numbers, we'd get sick over the fact that how these games can be used.
4080371	4084893	Well, Nintendo mentioned that they made $33 million on the virtual console, which isn't bad.
4085253	4086174	That is bad.
4086394	4087134	I mean, shit.
4087334	4088595	No, that's not bad at all.
4089615	4090516	That's not bad at all.
4090536	4102502	Yeah, I would be very interested because, you know, considering how much of a hassle it is with the Wii to get online sometimes, I mean, at least with the wireless, I do not understand why they didn't have an FNF port right there.
4103278	4104719	I would never understand that.
4104759	4107501	That $33 million is literally free money to them.
4107521	4110102	It's literally free money made out of thin air.
4110223	4110563	Of course.
4110623	4111503	It's all old games.
4112884	4120429	I mean, granted, they have to write those manuals and do the QA testing and all that stuff, but that's pennies compared to the bigger picture.
4120449	4122470	You know what I mean?
4123011	4124872	I'm sure a skill programmer could do that in an hour.
4125252	4125472	Yeah.
4126293	4126933	Crazy.
4127253	4131396	That's my concern because I have lost three systems and
4132088	4145591	I want Nintendo to be successful, but I don't want a system that nobody's buying games for eventually taking the rest of the industry down with it.
4147151	4149432	You see the trends.
4149732	4152872	You see more of these little mini-game crap coming out.
4154173	4159234	Personally, I don't blame the third parties because if they're not going to get big sales, they may as well go for the quick buck.
4161618	4172042	That could end up hurting the Wii after the Wii Sports FAD is done, or if the Wii Fit doesn't work very well here.
4173182	4185906	Nintendo's riding on real thin ground if they don't at least try to get the quality control up and try to help people realize, hey, this thing has other games.
4185926	4188307	I mean, Mario Galaxy didn't do as well in Japan.
4188347	4188927	What the hell?
4190380	4191501	That is a little bit surprising.
4193722	4197724	I mean, I thought, honestly, I thought Mario Galaxy was going to do a million in a week.
4198284	4198624	Honestly.
4199064	4200285	Because it's Mario.
4201706	4203066	It's freaking Mario.
4204867	4208469	Anyways, I've been ranting too long and I'm sure a whole lot of people want to get on the line.
4208529	4209209	That's alright.
4209950	4211311	Alright, we've got to let you go anyway for time.
4211351	4211971	But take care, buddy.
4212911	4213392	You do the same.
4213812	4214032	Bye-bye.
4215274	4220678	Alright, I think that's actually going to do it for calls tonight because we're running a little bit long tonight so we're going to go ahead and start to wrap up the program.
4221019	4223180	I do want to check and see if there's any more last minute stories.
4224341	4224521	Yeah.
4225722	4228745	Um, let's see here real quick I was just going to mention a few things that were kind of funny.
4229445	4238993	Um, there's actually a game coming out in Europe and this is really sad called MTV Fan Attack and it looks like you're like a VJ running from fans.
4240294	4240814	Interesting.
4241815	4242756	Wonderful shit.
4244157	4244297	Um,
4245359	4249081	And then this will piss off my wife really bad.
4249662	4254625	Her big complaint, you remember, I don't know, Rob, you probably remember her complaint about this.
4255145	4256326	The Golden Compass movie.
4257006	4259567	Apparently, the ending was not like the book.
4259848	4263009	There's a major scene that's cut out of the movie.
4264891	4267652	You know, not to give away any spoilers, but I will.
4268533	4274016	Apparently, a kid gets killed, or sacrificed to open a portal, you know.
4274693	4276474	Hey, if that was in Portal, that'd make the game even better.
4277994	4278975	Sacrificing bratty kids.
4279415	4283716	But, apparently, that footage, though, is in the game if you finish the game.
4284316	4288958	So, I will have to show this to her tonight, and I'm sure a director's cut of the movie will be in order.
4290899	4291179	Hmm.
4292899	4293280	Alright.
4294120	4295900	Anything else from Last Minute News tonight?
4299762	4300022	No.
4300302	4302803	That's a Me Too cover that's kind of funny for No More Heroes.
4303023	4303163	Heh.
4304345	4323495	and then I got a new they have a new wallpaper up on the No More Heroes website which this will now be my new wallpaper if Rob you want to take a look here oh yeah with him charging his that's disgusting beam saber awesome DarkSakura you have anything last minute for us?
4326196	4332499	I like pie that's not a spoiler no alright anyhow
4333479	4339720	Let's go around and get final thoughts for our program, because we're going to wrap this up and call it a week.
4340940	4341800	Loki, your final thought.
4342901	4345701	I hope we can fix my computer situation early.
4345721	4362784	I actually thought of something during the show that I need to check on, because my power supply apparently has a turbo mode on it and a normal mode, and the normal mode has the 12-volt rail broken up into four different rails, whereas turbo has it on one, and I'm wondering if I maybe switch that, if it'll work
4364266	4368069	Although I still think that the motherboard or graphics card is broken, so we'll see.
4368969	4373032	But I get to play tons of games this week, taking Wednesday through Friday off to play games.
4374192	4377254	My final thought is I have a two and a half week vacation coming up.
4377355	4379376	I just have to get through one more week of work to get there.
4379756	4380036	Awesome.
4380056	4380777	I'm so excited.
4381237	4382398	And I'm going to play a lot of games too.
4382758	4386400	And I'm going to work on Orange Lounge Radio stuff, which will be fun.
4386460	4387201	Jamie, your final thought.
4388277	4396124	I need to get Orange Box on PC so I can use the editor to put the Half-Life 2 maps in Portal and use the Portal gun in Half-Life.
4397085	4397325	Fun.
4398326	4399127	You get to work on that.
4400728	4401188	Eventually.
