6000	15000	To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.
15000	20000	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
20000	24000	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, December the 16th of 2007.
24000	27000	In the last segment we had a bunch of fun news.
27000	30000	We gave out our inaugural Stupid Awards, so check that out in part A.
30000	33000	Also we talked a little bit about the Wii and those rain checks.
33000	36000	Talking about Activision and harmonics not being able to get along.
36000	37000	But that's all in part A.
37000	40000	We're going to kick off part B tonight with some Squeenix news.
40000	41000	Yes, Loki?
41000	42000	Yes.
42000	46000	In fact, I don't know if you might remember this video from a while ago.
46000	51000	Temptation Sonata had a very, very annoying song to it with this...
51000	54000	I kind of like this song.
54000	57000	I believe it was even a cage match pick at one time.
57000	65000	Anyways, you may remember that the video featured blatant rip-offs of scenes from Advent Children.
65000	72000	Well, apparently Squeenix won a case against them for plagiarism.
72000	81000	And to the tune of 16 million won, or $17,400.
81000	86000	I guess the one is pesos, apparently.
86000	88000	So, yeah.
88000	89000	Oh well.
89000	90000	$17,000.
90000	91000	That's not bad.
91000	93000	But the video was pretty cool.
93000	95000	I mean, I don't know if you saw it.
95000	96000	I've seen it.
96000	97000	It was neat.
97000	99000	She had two other good songs on the album, too.
99000	104000	It was neat because it was Advent Children, but other than that it was...
104000	110000	Here's a little clip of the song, which I know does not do very well for a radio that
110000	114000	we're looking at a little component of the video here in studio.
114000	115000	Actually, maybe we won't.
115000	117000	It doesn't want to play.
117000	120000	It's probably because operator plagiarized.
120000	121000	Oh, is it really?
121000	122000	I have the whole album.
122000	123000	Oh.
123000	124000	It's Ivy.
124000	125000	We don't have to take a look at that.
125000	126000	Oh, that's okay.
126000	127000	It's not that important.
127000	129000	It's track two on the album.
129000	130000	There we go.
130000	133000	Ah, it's just not even in the song yet.
133000	134000	Forget it.
134000	137000	Operator 11, our bandwidth screwed thanks to them.
137000	140000	Yeah, it's alright.
140000	144000	I'm not that worried about it because I want to talk more about this.
144000	153000	Forget Square Enix winning all this money from this poor Korean chick who's singing.
153000	155000	I mean, whatever happened at the same time?
155000	156000	Invitation is the finest form of flattery.
156000	157000	Have you ever heard that?
157000	160000	Well, if you imitate it so well that, yeah.
160000	162000	Alright, well, anyhow.
162000	166000	Final Fantasy IV is getting a sequel, and this to me is awesome news.
166000	171000	I am so happy because Final Fantasy IV is my favorite in the entire Final Fantasy series.
171000	172000	I know.
172000	173000	Say what you will.
173000	175000	Final Fantasy VII, rah rah rah.
175000	180000	Final Fantasy IX, rah rah rah.
180000	181000	There's always that back and forth.
181000	185000	I have a soft spot in my heart for Final Fantasy IV because it was really the first Final Fantasy
185000	189000	game I was just so sucked into start to finish the entire way.
189000	193000	The game is going to be called Final Fantasy IV The After Return to the Moon.
193000	198000	It is a true sequel to the game which originally came out in 1991.
198000	202000	And then, do you know how this just ruined my day?
202000	205000	It's coming out in February on mobile phones.
205000	206000	That's right.
206000	209000	The Final Fantasy IV sequel is a mobile phone game.
209000	213000	It's coming out on NTT Docomo phones.
213000	217000	We don't even have stuff this powerful over here in this country that can run this stuff.
217000	218000	Yeah, we do.
218000	221000	They can run these type of games like they have in Japan?
221000	227000	We do, but they're expensive and they don't put anything out on them.
227000	231000	They've got them out over in Europe too.
231000	234000	It shouldn't be that big of a surprise because we've already heard about Parasite Eve III
234000	237000	and a Kingdom Hearts game coming over to mobile phone platforms.
237000	240000	But I don't want to play Final Fantasy IV on my mobile phone.
240000	244000	At least give me the freaking DS.
244000	247000	I was so angsty when I read this news earlier in the week.
247000	252000	I said, you know what, I know what segment I want to have follow this news story when we read it this week.
267000	270000	Privacy FUs of the week and Jamie's going to start us off.
270000	275000	My FU of the week goes towards the doctor that I saw who is not my regular doctor.
275000	278000	First of all, I'm not an idiot.
278000	281000	You can tell me what's freaking wrong.
281000	284000	You can tell me what you suspect to be wrong.
284000	288000	And, you know, I usually can follow what you're saying.
288000	290000	My doctor is great, okay?
290000	296000	If ever I remotely suspect anything is wrong or have an idea of what might be the cause.
296000	299000	You know me, I'll research the crap out of everything.
299000	303000	He listens to me and then he actually tests for the stuff that I suggest.
303000	309000	Which is how we found out, you know, found out how to treat chronic fatigue for me.
309000	314000	So that I could actually, you know, not pass out on a daily basis or be hurt or anything.
314000	322000	What happened is when I was in Alabama, and I don't know how I did it, but my right hand ring finger started, the tendon started to catch.
322000	328000	And I wouldn't be able to lift my finger in the morning unless I massaged it and got blood flowing.
328000	335000	And it was really inflamed along the tendon that goes down my palm, so I went to see this doctor.
335000	340000	And my regular doctor, I guess, was out for the holidays or something.
340000	346000	So, you know, he tested it and, you know, I had been icing it and doing all the right stuff.
346000	349000	But he said, okay, we're going to give you a cortisone shot.
349000	351000	I was like, what's actually wrong with it?
351000	353000	Oh, it's fine, we'll just do the shot.
353000	357000	And so he didn't tell me anything, so I actually, I got a cortisone shot in my hand.
357000	360000	And he wouldn't let me watch it either.
360000	365000	It pissed me off because I actually, I don't have the fear of needles that I used to, you know.
365000	367000	I give myself a shot in the leg twice a week.
367000	369000	I can stand watching a needle in my hand.
369000	375000	So he said he wouldn't do it until I, you know, would not watch him put the needle in.
375000	377000	I was like, dude, I'm not going to pass out.
377000	379000	And he's like, are you squeamish?
379000	380000	Are you going to pass out?
380000	382000	I'm like, no.
382000	388000	And so it took me looking up the symptoms myself and then looking up the treatments
388000	391000	to realize that he was treating me for trigger finger.
391000	396000	Which is funny because my grandma actually just had surgery on that one like about a month ago.
396000	398000	Runs in the family, right?
398000	400000	It's not hereditary.
400000	403000	Trigger finger has to do with inflammation of the tendons
403000	407000	and that it's slipping out of the tendon sheath that goes over the tendons.
407000	409000	Then it's just irony.
409000	413000	Yeah, it's coincidence.
413000	418000	However, I will go ahead and say that I am having a lot less pain in the hand.
418000	421000	It's going to be another few days before the cortisone takes full effect
421000	423000	and I start physical therapy next week.
423000	426000	So that's, you know, fun, but not.
426000	435000	So F.U. to doctors who do not communicate with their patients.
435000	437000	I'm going to go back and see my regular doctor.
437000	439000	Let's move on, Loki, your F.U.
439000	442000	Anyways, my F.U. of the week.
442000	448000	Not a big surprise to EVGA for giving me a card that's set on arrival.
448000	453000	For the other thing also, for the card being a gimp version of the normal card that should have been,
453000	456000	or the motherboard being a gimp version of that,
456000	460000	with no possible way for me to know what's going wrong when there is something going wrong.
460000	462000	So now I just have to kind of guess.
462000	465000	It'll be the last time I buy a motherboard from them
465000	468000	and it'll probably be the last time I buy a motherboard from Newegg as well
468000	474000	because they apparently are pawning off crap that's gimp versions of the real thing.
474000	476000	So, that sucks.
476000	480000	I'll buy from Fry's, so that way if it sucks and it's not working,
480000	483000	I can take it right back the next day or the same day,
483000	486000	instead of having to do this whole RMA process.
486000	488000	Alright, is that it?
488000	489000	That's it.
489000	492000	My F.U. of the week goes to Mondays.
492000	494000	I'll keep it short, I hate Mondays as do we all.
494000	498000	You know, Jamie, when you get that controlling time thing figured out,
498000	501000	can you figure out a way to do away with Mondays?
501000	504000	Maybe we should just give Monday a different name.
504000	505000	Fun Day!
505000	507000	But it would be the same thing.
507000	509000	No, I don't like that idea.
509000	511000	Mondays are horrible.
511000	514000	Alright, so that's it, that's my F.U. of the week.
514000	517000	Now we can get back into some gaming news, can't we?
517000	520000	Yes, we can.
520000	523000	Well, we have some news.
523000	527000	For our friends who are interested in GameTap,
527000	535000	we will be having Street Fighter III Third Strike as of December 20th.
535000	541000	No online play, but it's Street Fighter III Third Strike.
541000	545000	So, hey, that's good.
545000	550000	And on top of that, if you've got the Capcom joystick,
550000	554000	I think that they actually do have some compatibility with it through GameTap.
554000	557000	It's been a long time since I've used that service.
557000	559000	I was kind of sad about the games leaving,
559000	561000	and I guess they did some client upgrade.
561000	563000	I haven't even checked it out yet.
563000	566000	If I'm not playing it enough, I ought to just cancel the darn thing,
566000	568000	but there's still a lot about it I like.
568000	570000	We'll see.
570000	572000	Moving on with more news.
572000	574000	Yes.
574000	578000	Anyways, so, I don't know, this isn't really a big surprise for me,
578000	581000	but Mass Effect is selling very well.
581000	585000	In fact, they've sold millions.
585000	589000	Over the three weeks since launch,
589000	593000	they have sold over one million units globally,
593000	597000	and that should be pretty good, I guess.
597000	599000	I don't know. It's a good game.
599000	601000	I'd like to sell a million copies of anything.
601000	604000	That would be pretty good for business, I would think.
604000	607000	Millions of copies.
607000	610000	A lot of people would like certain other games to sell a million copies worldwide.
610000	612000	Like the Eye of Judgment?
612000	614000	Maybe.
614000	618000	Maybe they'll sell millions of movies on the Xbox Live Marketplace pretty soon,
618000	622000	because now it has expanded, finally, after all this time.
622000	625000	It's not just the North America-U.S.
625000	628000	It's just the U.S. really had the video marketplace before.
628000	632000	Now it's expanding to other parts of North America, including Canada,
632000	638000	and then overseas as well, the U.K., Ireland, France, and Germany
638000	643000	are all getting the Xbox Live Marketplace finally in their territories.
643000	645000	We would tell you more about what's on it,
645000	648000	but how many of you guys don't have Netflix accounts
648000	650000	or some other way of getting your movies?
650000	652000	No, I guess the Xbox Live Marketplace is pretty cool
652000	657000	for looking at high-def stuff on demand.
657000	663000	The Microsoft Points breakdown structure is very similar to what they have here in the U.S.,
663000	667000	but just translated for the other countries
667000	670000	when it comes to how much they pay for the Microsoft Points.
670000	672000	Well, there you have it.
672000	675000	Of course, some people might just kind of think,
675000	678000	why should I even bother with the video marketplace at all
678000	680000	now that the Xbox 360 has DIVX?
680000	682000	That's a very good question.
682000	684000	DIVX is special.
684000	687000	It's the right thing. You want to do the legal thing, right?
687000	689000	Right?
689000	691000	Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp.
691000	692000	All right, more news.
692000	694000	All right, well, hey, guess what?
694000	697000	Assassin's Creed has sold a bunch.
697000	702000	They have sold 2.5 million copies globally,
702000	706000	and they've sold a whole bunch more than they thought it would.
706000	711000	They are hoping to reach 5 million by March 08.
711000	713000	And I still have yet to play the damn game.
713000	714000	I think I have it.
714000	716000	You can probably borrow mine.
716000	717000	Really?
717000	718000	Yeah.
718000	720000	I kind of want to play it before our year-end show,
720000	722000	because I hear a lot of people saying it's a great game
722000	724000	and deserves to be on year-end's best list.
724000	726000	So it won't make mine, though,
726000	728000	if I don't ever get a chance to play it.
728000	730000	So I may take you up on that, Jamie.
730000	732000	Did you play Assassin's Creed, Loki?
732000	733000	You talked about it.
733000	734000	Briefly.
734000	735000	You didn't like it, right?
735000	736000	No.
736000	738000	What was your problem with it?
738000	740000	I don't know.
740000	742000	I just didn't like how intricate it was.
742000	745000	The control scheme for it, I didn't care for.
745000	748000	I just really didn't get to play it much.
748000	751000	The thing was, it didn't really hook me, I guess.
751000	753000	I played it for a few minutes.
753000	756000	I was like, eh, I don't really want to give this any more time.
756000	757000	All right.
757000	760000	So I didn't.
760000	765000	Anyways, there's some interesting news coming out
765000	767000	from the company Gearbox.
767000	773000	And, of course, they have done stuff
773000	776000	like the brand new Brothers in Arms series.
776000	778000	Hell's Highway, actually, one of the titles
778000	781000	that keeps getting pushed back.
781000	787000	So one thing that they're looking for for some inspiration
787000	789000	is actually the game Portal.
789000	791000	Because most of their games, I think, in the past
791000	792000	have been pretty linear.
792000	795000	They like the way that Portal, the whole story layout
795000	796000	and stuff like that.
796000	801000	Hopefully, in the future, we'll see some more futuristic games
801000	802000	from Gearbox.
802000	804000	So that's pretty cool.
804000	806000	Now, you're a big fan of Portal, Jamie.
806000	807000	Yes, I am.
807000	809000	And do you believe that more games should
809000	812000	take inspiration from Portal?
812000	813000	I think so.
813000	815000	I mean, because, honestly, what they're doing
815000	818000	is taking, I actually have to say,
818000	821000	because also listening to some of the commentary in the game,
821000	823000	I think it was pretty cool that they were taking
823000	825000	different concepts in physics and trying
825000	828000	to incorporate them into the gameplay in a completely
828000	829000	different way.
829000	832000	Changing, instead of having puzzle here,
832000	840000	you don't necessarily think in height and width and depth.
840000	843000	You think in terms of manipulating that space
843000	844000	to your own ends.
844000	846000	And I think that that's pretty cool.
846000	849000	And it completely offers a completely different range
849000	853000	of freedom, I think, as far as how they can design a game.
853000	854000	Very cool.
854000	856000	I'm going to have to listen to that commentary stuff
856000	856000	sometime.
856000	858000	I think more games should have commentary tracks on it.
858000	860000	I think that's a pretty interesting idea.
860000	862000	Well, it's hard to have a commentary track in the game.
862000	865000	I like the way that Portal kind of did it,
865000	867000	where you just kind of go up to something
867000	869000	and then kind of play the game from there.
869000	872000	It had like a little chat box over it
872000	874000	that you could highlight with your gun.
874000	876000	And then it would play.
876000	878000	And it actually gave you a meter bar
878000	880000	so you see how far through the commentary you were
880000	881000	and you could pause it.
881000	882000	Huh.
882000	883000	That's pretty cool.
883000	885000	Well, of course, there are a lot of fans of Portal.
885000	890000	And I'm sure this is something that Jamie would want to get.
890000	892000	It's a plush companion cube.
892000	893000	That's right.
893000	894000	There is officially.
894000	896000	Now, you may have seen this, that there
896000	900000	was a lot of fan-made weighted companion cubes being made
900000	902000	and there was a lot of fan stuff.
902000	905000	Well, Valve actually decided to put their own version out
905000	907000	because I'm sure they're seeing what other people are doing
907000	909000	and they're like, hey, we need to get a piece of that.
909000	911000	So they put out official weighted companion cube
911000	912000	plushies.
912000	915000	And in less than 24 hours, the damn thing sold out.
915000	917000	That's how popular these things are.
917000	919000	I'm actually seeing if they still have the fuzzy dice.
919000	922000	They went on sale at 4 o'clock on Friday
922000	924000	and sold out by noon on Saturday.
924000	925000	That's crazy.
925000	927000	I guess they'll have to make more.
927000	928000	I just want the fuzzy dice.
928000	930000	These could be more popular than the Wii.
930000	931000	I just want the fuzzy dice.
931000	932000	You just want the fuzzy dice?
932000	934000	Are you actually going to hang them in your car?
934000	937000	Yes, I will because my Pac-Man dice are highly faded now.
937000	938000	Oh, that's too bad.
938000	939000	Well, then your weighted companion cubes will fade.
939000	941000	They'll burn up just like they do in the game.
941000	942000	Spoiler.
942000	943000	Oh, my bad.
943000	944000	You know what?
944000	946000	Dan was really funny about that part.
946000	947000	How so?
947000	949000	I think it's what I'd mentioned to you earlier.
949000	951000	Dan's like, yeah, it's very obvious that the character
951000	954000	you're playing is female because they expect you to get
954000	958000	all sappy and all sobby over your weighted companion
958000	959000	cube being dead.
959000	961000	It's a cube.
961000	963000	I was like, you don't get it.
963000	965000	You can also tell your main character's a woman
965000	966000	because in the very beginning of the game,
966000	967000	there's like a mirror.
967000	970000	And you see that your character has boobs, OMG boobs.
970000	972000	Well, he was joking.
972000	975000	If you look at her face, though, that could very well be a man.
975000	976000	It's pretty ugly.
976000	979000	He's actually modeled after some person.
979000	981000	She's a man, baby.
981000	985000	He was cracking up, though, over the part where you get out
985000	986000	after the 19th.
986000	987000	What is up with Chat?
987000	990000	Chat is on their like crazy kick where they're just now naming
990000	993000	all of these games, putting Portal in place of the titles
993000	994000	of the games.
994000	997000	Portal of Honor, Need for Portal, Portal of Duty,
997000	1001000	Portal Combat, Super Smash Portal, Portal, Portal Paradise,
1001000	1003000	The King of Portal 11.
1003000	1005000	What the hell is wrong with you people?
1005000	1007000	It's the cocaine.
1007000	1008000	There's a lot of cocaine.
1008000	1010000	Have we been giving out cocaine in Chat?
1010000	1011000	Share, please.
1011000	1012000	No kidding.
1015000	1016000	All right.
1016000	1020000	Well, moving on to other gaming news then.
1020000	1021000	I don't want to.
1021000	1022000	You have to.
1022000	1025000	OK.
1025000	1031000	Lost Odyssey is supposed to, it's actually going to be out
1031000	1035000	on Xbox 360 as an exclusive RPG.
1035000	1038000	And it has a release date of February 12th.
1038000	1042000	And downloadable content will be on its way.
1042000	1046000	Aren't I supposed to be able to get download content for free
1046000	1047000	if I pre-order or something?
1047000	1049000	I thought I read something about that.
1049000	1052000	It's actually saying that downloadable content will be
1052000	1055000	made exclusive to anyone who pre-orders.
1055000	1056000	Oh.
1056000	1058000	Oh, so I don't get free download content.
1058000	1062000	I just get to, I get to pay more to have the download content
1062000	1063000	if I pre-order.
1063000	1064000	Oh, OK.
1064000	1065000	That would make more sense.
1065000	1066000	I would hope so.
1066000	1068000	Because they can use the codes and stuff, right?
1068000	1069000	Yeah.
1069000	1070000	They'll give you codes.
1070000	1071000	That's what I would think.
1071000	1072000	All right.
1072000	1075000	I don't know if you've heard much about this game yet.
1075000	1079000	Well, I didn't get very highly, or reviews weren't that great
1079000	1081000	on it in Japan.
1081000	1083000	The trailer looked really good.
1083000	1084000	It did.
1084000	1087000	But then I heard it's not doing, like it did not get very well
1087000	1088000	received over in Japan.
1088000	1090000	So that makes me a little less excited about it.
1090000	1093000	What's interesting though, which people might not know,
1093000	1095000	is it's on four DVDs.
1095000	1097000	Just like Blue Dragon was on three.
1097000	1099000	Wow.
1099000	1100000	Go DVDs.
1100000	1101000	Yay.
1101000	1103000	Can't fit all that space on there.
1103000	1104000	So sad.
1104000	1105000	This game must be epic.
1105000	1106000	It's very epic.
1106000	1108000	You know what, actually, sadly enough,
1108000	1112000	know what the game looked like, and that's not really a good point for it.
1112000	1117000	Kind of reminds me a little bit of, oh god, what is that game now?
1117000	1119000	I just had the name.
1119000	1121000	I don't know, you bought it.
1121000	1124000	It's like, not Phantasy Star.
1124000	1125000	99 Nights?
1125000	1127000	Not 99 Nights.
1127000	1128000	Enchanted Arms.
1128000	1129000	Oh, OK.
1129000	1131000	Yeah, that's not a good thing to be compared to.
1131000	1134000	Enchanted Arms wasn't horrible, it just wasn't great.
1134000	1137000	I don't know.
1137000	1145000	Anyways, so, the Mega Man 20th anniversary countdown apparently ends tonight.
1145000	1147000	And what exactly does that mean?
1147000	1149000	Well, who knows?
1149000	1153000	But there's going to be a big announcement, of course, coming soon.
1153000	1155000	Probably, I'd imagine, a new game.
1155000	1161000	Hopefully not another, like, oh surprise, it's a remake or another collection.
1161000	1163000	Mega Man Battle Network again.
1163000	1164000	Yay.
1164000	1165000	Yay.
1165000	1167000	How about Mega Man Legends 3?
1167000	1170000	Haven't you guys been hankering for some of that for a while?
1170000	1172000	Fuck yeah.
1172000	1174000	Of course, they're never going to give that to us.
1174000	1175000	Never say never.
1175000	1181000	Some theories might be that Mega Man's going to be announced as an official character in Super Smash Bros. Brawl,
1181000	1186000	which I would think that would be covered on the daily updates on their stupid website.
1186000	1189000	I think they would have done it already, if that was true.
1189000	1199000	I was seeing right now, if there's any sort of update here, other than, well, right now it just says,
1199000	1203000	I guess, four hours and four minutes?
1203000	1205000	I can't read Japanese, dammit.
1205000	1211000	But there's 0404, so either I got the wrong page,
1211000	1213000	which is entirely possible.
1213000	1215000	Happy birthday, Rockman.
1215000	1218000	Still looking like a chick.
1218000	1225000	RawstealUT says in response to the whole Mega Man Legends 3,
1225000	1227000	SkyCapcom can't do that.
1227000	1230000	That'd make Mega Man relevant again.
1230000	1231000	I guess that's true.
1231000	1233000	Jamie made a face at that comment.
1233000	1234000	What was that face about?
1234000	1235000	You made a face.
1235000	1236000	It was just a face.
1236000	1237000	Oh, I see.
1237000	1240000	It was an angry face, or it was a ger face.
1240000	1242000	It was a face.
1242000	1243000	I see.
1243000	1244000	All right.
1244000	1248000	Well, now I know this news ought to make Jamie happy.
1248000	1251000	This is something that will make Jamie very happy for Christmas.
1251000	1252000	But I don't know, maybe not.
1252000	1257000	Christmas Nights, you know, Jamie always talks about her annual tradition
1257000	1260000	of putting the Saturn back up and playing some Christmas Nights every year.
1260000	1264000	Well, maybe she won't have to anymore because it is going to be included
1264000	1269000	in the PlayStation 2 remake of Nights into Dreams for the PlayStation 2.
1269000	1271000	It's going to have Christmas Nights as well.
1271000	1274000	The bad news for Jamie, it's a Japan-only release,
1274000	1275000	so she's going to have to pay more money to import it.
1275000	1277000	Like, that's a bad thing at all.
1277000	1279000	I've got a Japanese PlayStation 2.
1279000	1281000	I do have to admit, remember they said they weren't really remaking the game?
1281000	1282000	Uh-huh.
1282000	1284000	The graphics do look a little bit sharper.
1284000	1286000	Well, they probably went back and undressed some things
1286000	1287000	and cleaned some things up.
1287000	1289000	To also make another point,
1289000	1294000	the Saturn did not have nearly the 3D capability that the PlayStation did.
1294000	1296000	And so being on the PlayStation 2,
1296000	1300000	one would think that it has a better 3D processor than the Saturn would.
1300000	1303000	So it would have to be cleaner textures and that type of thing.
1303000	1304000	Yeah, but true.
1304000	1306000	But then you also forget the fact that people like to slack off
1306000	1309000	when they port games over and they'll just port them exactly the same
1309000	1312000	for authentic purposes, you know?
1312000	1315000	I think even so, even if it was ported over just the same,
1315000	1320000	it still has better, it'd be better capable of processing it.
1320000	1322000	Now, Jamie, it's not going to be as simple, unfortunately,
1322000	1324000	as paying all the money to import the game
1324000	1326000	because not only are you going to have to do that,
1326000	1330000	but then you have to beat Nights into Dreams
1330000	1332000	and then you will unlock Christmas Dreams.
1332000	1335000	Tell me how that's hard.
1335000	1338000	I'm just saying, you've got to put a little bit of work into it.
1338000	1340000	You might have to lift a finger, Jamie, to get your Christmas Dreams.
1340000	1342000	You know the hardest thing about that is going to be playing
1342000	1344000	without getting motion sick
1344000	1348000	because Nights is another one of those games that makes me motion sick.
1348000	1354000	I got really sick playing Portal earlier.
1354000	1356000	Okay, Portal, right cake attorney.
1356000	1358000	Okay, no more Portal jokes.
1358000	1360000	Jesus, they are still going.
1360000	1362000	That's great.
1362000	1364000	Shut up.
1364000	1367000	Portal, right cake attorney.
1367000	1369000	I'm leaving chat so I don't have to read any more of that.
1369000	1371000	Lordy.
1371000	1373000	Chat room, you're banned from commenting on our program for a little bit
1373000	1375000	so you can calm down with the Portal stuff.
1375000	1377000	Portal combat.
1377000	1380000	If they could behave.
1380000	1382000	All right, we'll see if they can behave during our next segment,
1382000	1384000	the weekly mailbag segment.
1384000	1387000	Every week you send in your e-mails to mailbag at orangelaundry.com
1387000	1391000	and we pick a few of our favorites to read right here on the air.
1391000	1394000	And Jamie will read them and we'll compliment you or we'll make fun of you
1394000	1397000	or we'll answer your question or we'll sing a song and dance.
1397000	1399000	Who knows, it's unpredictable.
1399000	1401000	It's the mailbag segment.
1401000	1405000	Jamie, open up ye old mailbag and tell us what's in it this week.
1405000	1409000	I will be doing neither song nor dance, just to make a point of order.
1409000	1411000	But if you'd like to, you can dance to the song playing in the background.
1411000	1413000	Those of you playing along at home.
1413000	1414000	No, you can't.
1414000	1416000	I'll pop my head.
1416000	1419000	First e-mail.
1419000	1423000	From Riz, I guess is how it's pronounced.
1423000	1425000	Hi Rob, Jamie, and Matt.
1425000	1429000	This e-mail was constructed for a number of reasons which are detailed below.
1429000	1432000	I would first like to say what a pleasure listening to your podcast has been.
1432000	1434000	Oh, thank you.
1434000	1437000	I have enjoyed OOR since around March and have been greatly entertained
1437000	1441000	by their mix of news, banter, and general chaos.
1441000	1444000	I have been visually impaired since birth
1444000	1447000	but was able to play a number of video games when I was younger.
1447000	1450000	Due to a deterioration in my eyesight over the years,
1450000	1453000	the number of games I can play is now greatly reduced.
1453000	1456000	I still like to follow the rather hectic and frantic world of video games
1456000	1458000	and your podcast is perfect for that.
1458000	1462000	I have a question regarding music and podcasts which I would greatly appreciate an answer.
1462000	1465000	I've just started my own podcast and would like to know
1465000	1468000	am I able to use video game music for intros and outros?
1468000	1470000	Obviously, the podcast is free.
1470000	1472000	I apologize if this e-mail has gone too long.
1472000	1474000	Keep up the good work.
1474000	1478000	I find that most companies and stuff generally don't care
1478000	1481000	if you use video game music and stuff.
1481000	1484000	It's promotion for them.
1484000	1486000	What do they care?
1486000	1489000	I believe there's some type of fair use law out there or something
1489000	1492000	that as long as you limit it to 30 seconds, you're fine.
1492000	1494000	Nobody can really sue you over it.
1494000	1497000	Sure, the polite thing to do is ask and all that stuff,
1497000	1500000	but I think as long as you use it, especially the old stuff,
1500000	1503000	the old 8-Bit stuff which I know a lot of podcasts use for their openings and things,
1503000	1505000	nobody's really going to care.
1505000	1506000	I think it's fine.
1506000	1508000	Next e-mail.
1508000	1511000	I would like to thank Sky Dark Sakura and Loki
1511000	1514000	for hosting the best gaming podcast on the internet.
1514000	1517000	I just started listening a couple of weeks ago and already I'm hooked.
1517000	1520000	I've already been scouring the internet for all the episodes I can download.
1520000	1522000	I listen to them on my PSP.
1522000	1524000	More PSP listeners?
1524000	1526000	I said in part A. There were some. They do exist.
1526000	1528000	There's no better place for gaming news and humor.
1528000	1529000	One quick question though.
1529000	1532000	Is there anywhere I can download previous episodes?
1532000	1534000	The RSS feed only goes back a few episodes
1534000	1537000	and there's about 250 more I can't find.
1537000	1539000	Thanks and screw Rock Band for sucking so much online.
1539000	1541000	pkgr92
1541000	1544000	If you go to OLRPSP.com,
1544000	1547000	the parser over there actually goes back a few more episodes,
1547000	1550000	which if you're listening on your PSP, you've probably already done.
1550000	1553000	You can go back about 20 episodes there.
1553000	1558000	Otherwise, we keep, I think, some of the websites like
1558000	1563000	Yahoo Podcasts, I want to say.
1563000	1564000	What about iTunes?
1564000	1566000	Podcast Alley.
1566000	1571000	The one on iTunes only goes back 10 listings, which is about five episodes.
1571000	1576000	The reason for that is to prevent what happened a few years ago to some podcasts
1576000	1580000	is that this new application came out for the Xbox 360 called XB Stream.
1580000	1583000	It's a great idea and a great application.
1583000	1586000	We're actually a default podcast that's on it when you put this thing in.
1586000	1589000	But for the default podcast that we're on, the very first version of it,
1589000	1594000	what happened is that the program downloaded every single program from the feed,
1594000	1596000	which for people that never cleaned up their feeds,
1596000	1600000	meant their server was getting hammered for like 100 downloads of big shows at once.
1600000	1602000	So we keep our feed tidy for that reason,
1602000	1605000	so that if you use a grabber that does something like that
1605000	1608000	where it gets all episodes of a show, you're limited to 10.
1608000	1609000	That's pretty much the reason we do it.
1609000	1612000	We only do server cleans about once every few months when we need the space.
1612000	1614000	Otherwise, if you want to find shows older than that,
1614000	1616000	ask around the community, post on the forums.
1616000	1622000	I know there's one person out there that probably has every pre-podcast show we ever did.
1622000	1624000	I know there's at least one person out there that has that.
1624000	1626000	I don't even have that to put it in perspective.
1626000	1628000	I've asked and haven't heard anything.
1628000	1631000	I have a lot, and we might put out some DVDs out there,
1631000	1635000	but we can't do any big releases of it just because of some of the things.
1635000	1638000	We might have to do something kind of like under the table for the fans only
1638000	1641000	because there was some copyright music, so we can't really sell it for profit.
1641000	1645000	But anything's a possibility in the near future, so we'll see.
1645000	1648000	There's also a funny quote on here from Loki.
1648000	1649000	Sure.
1649000	1650000	Friendship is like peeing on yourself.
1650000	1654000	Everyone can see it, but only you get the warm feeling it brings.
1654000	1656000	Wow.
1656000	1659000	Yeah.
1659000	1661000	To Sky.
1661000	1664000	I was wondering why every time G4 is brought up on the show,
1664000	1666000	you moan and groan about how much you hate it.
1666000	1670000	I hate G4.
1670000	1672000	It isn't that bad in my opinion.
1672000	1674000	The shows such as Attack of the Show being my favorite,
1674000	1677000	X-Play, Cheat, and Ninja Warrior are all awesome.
1677000	1680000	I can understand that a lot of people wish that it were more like it used to be
1680000	1685000	when it was tech TV, but had a more gaming-oriented atmosphere to it.
1685000	1690000	Hell, I'm pissed that they took off icons and replaced it with crap like cheaters and cops.
1690000	1691000	But you shouldn't hate G4 completely.
1691000	1693000	It still has some great shows on it.
1693000	1694000	Thanks, Oscar.
1694000	1697000	PS, have you guys seen the zero punctuation gaming reviews?
1697000	1698000	Here's a link to the site.
1698000	1700000	Oh, I have to see this.
1700000	1701000	That's some funny shit.
1701000	1703000	Yeah, I watch it every week.
1703000	1705000	See, that's the kind of shit that G4 needs on television,
1705000	1708000	not the crap they have now that feels so, you know,
1708000	1711000	where the game reviews are written by interns and all this stuff.
1711000	1718000	X-Play is turned into a speck of what it used to be back when it was on tech TV.
1718000	1722000	It's just you pretty much named all the reasons right there in your e-mail.
1722000	1726000	It's nothing like it could have been with the whole tech TV merge and stuff,
1726000	1730000	and it just got too corporate and yucky, and it's owned by E, for God's sakes.
1730000	1731000	I mean, I don't know.
1731000	1735000	It's just everything that's kind of disturbing about corporate media
1735000	1740000	is kind of like embodied in G4, and that's why I just don't like it.
1740000	1745000	And I'm allowed not to like things.
1745000	1747000	Next e-mail.
1747000	1748000	Hi, guys.
1748000	1749000	Yes.
1749000	1751000	I know you don't normally read FUs from listeners,
1751000	1754000	but I was in a car accident yesterday, and I really wanted to vent somewhere.
1754000	1755000	Why not?
1755000	1759000	To the woman in the Jeep who tried to pass me by going onto the oncoming traffic
1759000	1762000	while I was making a U-turn at Big Fat FU.
1762000	1767000	This is on my last day of finals, and I was just about to go home from Davis,
1767000	1768000	and I am pissed off.
1768000	1770000	I'm going to have to agree with Loki.
1770000	1771000	The woman driver is in the sack area.
1771000	1773000	I can't drive for anything, except me.
1773000	1775000	That would be me.
1775000	1776000	Unfortunately, everyone is okay.
1776000	1779000	Although, my head slams into the car door during the impact.
1779000	1781000	The only part of this is that since I won't have a car for a while,
1781000	1784000	I'll be able to sit at home and play all the games I want over the break.
1784000	1788000	That being the case, what are your favorite games that came out this holiday season
1788000	1792000	on any console since I guess I'll be looking for something to pass the time?
1792000	1793000	Keep up the awesome show.
1793000	1795000	I need something to keep my spirits up.
1795000	1797000	What an awesome way to start the holidays.
1797000	1799000	Happy holidays, AZHP.
1799000	1801000	Portal.
1801000	1804000	I don't want to give it all away, because then I'd be basically giving you
1804000	1806000	my favorite games of the year.
1806000	1808000	But I will back up what Jamie said.
1808000	1812000	I think Orange Box in general is a very good investment.
1812000	1814000	Here's a thought, though.
1814000	1816000	Use this period, this opportunity.
1816000	1818000	I'm glad you have such a positive attitude about it,
1818000	1820000	because that really sucks what happened.
1820000	1822000	I'm glad you have a good attitude about it.
1822000	1824000	Instead of necessarily having to play everything new that comes out,
1824000	1826000	go back and play the shit you missed,
1826000	1829000	because I bet there's a lot of stuff that you missed towards the end of last year,
1829000	1830000	but amongst all the console madness.
1830000	1831000	It'll give you a great example for me.
1831000	1833000	Final Fantasy XII.
1833000	1836000	I did not get nearly as far in that game as I would have liked to,
1836000	1838000	because it was an amazing battle system in the game,
1838000	1841000	and I just never really got a chance to just play it the whole way through to completion.
1841000	1844000	That's one of those games I would like to complete one day when there's time.
1844000	1848000	So I would encourage you to actually take this opportunity to go revisit the past games
1848000	1851000	and beat stuff you haven't yet that you wanted to.
1851000	1853000	You can go to Deliverance Online and download Ragnarok Online
1853000	1856000	and play on the server with me and Ranma,
1856000	1859000	and join the OLR Guild on there.
1859000	1860000	Yeah, there you go.
1860000	1861000	Join an MMO.
1861000	1862000	That'll suck up all your time.
1862000	1864000	There you have it.
1864000	1866000	AZHP is actually in chat right now and says,
1866000	1869000	I just finished XII during finals week.
1869000	1870000	LOL.
1870000	1873000	How did you have time to beat a Final Fantasy game during finals?
1873000	1875000	Are you taking home ec?
1875000	1876000	What is up with that?
1876000	1877000	Wow, that's amazing.
1877000	1878000	Hey, Rob.
1878000	1879000	What, what?
1879000	1881000	I actually, one of my finals weeks,
1881000	1883000	I stayed up for three days and played D&D every night.
1883000	1884000	Oh, my God.
1884000	1885000	You guys are crazy.
1885000	1886000	I passed out on the fourth day.
1886000	1889000	I was kept alive by Jolt Cola and Pixie Sticks.
1889000	1891000	Loki, any recommendations for our listener
1891000	1894000	who's handicapped for Winter Break
1894000	1897000	for games to play while they're on Winter Break?
1897000	1902000	Well, Call of Duty 4 is pretty good, I guess.
1902000	1903000	Yeah, actually it is.
1903000	1906000	Halo 3.
1906000	1910000	Super Mario Galaxy.
1910000	1911000	I don't know.
1911000	1912000	You can play a ton of stuff.
1912000	1914000	There's tons of games out there.
1914000	1916000	Just play something you haven't played yet.
1916000	1917000	There you go.
1917000	1918000	RPGs.
1918000	1919000	There you go.
1919000	1921000	We'll bring you a Nintendo.
1921000	1922000	And you can play classic stuff.
1922000	1923000	You can play Guardian Legend.
1923000	1924000	That's right.
1924000	1927000	Go back and play every Saturn game you didn't play previously.
1927000	1930000	Dear God, I don't have enough room for that.
1930000	1931000	All right, anyhow.
1931000	1932000	I know what you should do.
1932000	1934000	Find me a copy of Burning Rangers.
1934000	1937000	Next email, please.
1937000	1940000	First of all, Merry early Christmas slash Happy Holidays.
1940000	1942000	I'm not sure if you're doing an episode for the 23rd,
1942000	1944000	and I don't think I can listen live on the 16th,
1944000	1946000	which, as of this writing, is today,
1946000	1948000	since I have a final exam the next day.
1948000	1950000	Oops, good luck on that.
1950000	1953000	This is from GS68, by the way.
1953000	1954000	Who happens to be in chat, by the way,
1954000	1955000	so I guess he found a way.
1955000	1956000	Yeah.
1956000	1958000	Second, there's one particular issue
1958000	1961000	that concerns me regarding fellow gamers.
1961000	1963000	On sites like Game Politics, Facebook,
1963000	1964000	and especially GameSpot,
1964000	1966000	there are gamers who are quick to get angry
1966000	1968000	and defensive about their games whenever Dr. Phil,
1968000	1971000	whose comment on the game usage, not games,
1971000	1974000	being a problem was, in my opinion,
1974000	1976000	a step in the right direction,
1976000	1978000	although many people who commented on the story
1978000	1980000	just saw the name Dr. Phil and immediately thought,
1980000	1983000	oh my God, it's Dr. Phil, he sucks yours.
1983000	1987000	JT censorship and school shootings show up.
1987000	1988000	In fact, I see comments along the lines of,
1988000	1991000	I hope JT gets his ass kicked so hard he goes sterile,
1991000	1995000	and worse, maybe Microsoft will hire a drifter and kill him.
1995000	1997000	It's rather ironic that there are gamers
1997000	1999000	who oppose the idea that video games
1999000	2001000	make people violent-minded
2001000	2004000	and then go on wishing death upon Jackie Pooh.
2004000	2006000	I dislike JT as much as the next gamer,
2006000	2008000	especially his reaction to gamers' email.
2008000	2011000	The Flowers for Jack project and its outcome are a prime example.
2011000	2013000	But what he, as gamers, need to realize
2013000	2016000	is that by personally attacking him back unprofessionally
2016000	2018000	and wishing physical injury or death upon him,
2018000	2021000	we are reinforcing his belief that violent video games
2021000	2024000	are bad for the mind and stooping to his level
2024000	2026000	of ad hominem attacks,
2026000	2028000	which is a whole different topic,
2028000	2030000	and I'll probably get into future emails,
2030000	2032000	Skype call, whatever.
2032000	2034000	Those kinds of personal attacks make us gamers
2034000	2037000	look bad in front of people supportive of video game censorship,
2037000	2040000	and if we need to get Sensible Worth Academy,
2040000	2042000	no, as if we need to get Sensible Worth Academy,
2042000	2047000	is this kind of defensiveness and immaturity
2047000	2051000	that also led to the creation of the otaku stereotype.
2051000	2054000	And I'm a gamer and an anime slash manga fan,
2054000	2056000	so facepalm.
2056000	2058000	And with all of that said,
2058000	2060000	I wish the three of you and any guests also in the studio
2060000	2062000	a great holiday. Don't die in a car fire.
2062000	2064000	Yours truly, GS68.
2064000	2065000	We'll try, thanks.
2065000	2068000	PS, are you three going to SAC Anime this January?
2068000	2070000	I'm hoping to go, and it would be great to see you guys there
2070000	2073000	since I didn't get a chance to go to last summer SAC Anime.
2073000	2076000	Oh, God, I didn't realize there was one in January, too.
2076000	2077000	I forgot about it.
2077000	2078000	We should try to do a panel.
2078000	2080000	I gotta get in touch with Jonas about that.
2080000	2081000	We'll try and go.
2081000	2082000	Not at 8 in the morning.
2082000	2083000	Nah, as long as we get a...
2083000	2084000	Not at 8 in the morning.
2084000	2085000	We're not going again if our panel's at 8 in the morning,
2085000	2086000	but if we can get something better, we'll go.
2086000	2089000	I probably won't cosplay unless it's my, um,
2089000	2092000	Organization 13 costume, so.
2092000	2094000	Uh, last email.
2094000	2095000	Dun dun dun.
2095000	2097000	From Cheeseburger.
2097000	2099000	Who signed it with a question mark?
2099000	2101000	I can ask Cheeseburger?
2101000	2102000	This is Cheeseburger.
2102000	2106000	Hey, OLR crew, I have been listening to your podcast
2106000	2108000	for almost a year and a half now, and I think it's great.
2108000	2109000	You're still with us? Cool.
2109000	2110000	That's cool.
2110000	2113000	I have also listened live and interacted in chat a few times, too.
2113000	2116000	The reason for this email is to ask Rob about Civilization 3,
2116000	2120000	which I purchased for my new computer on his recommendation.
2120000	2122000	What's your perspective on that game?
2122000	2126000	And I also chose Russia because I thought I could make nuclear weapons
2126000	2127000	and blow everything up.
2127000	2131000	The only other PC games I have are StarCraft and Black & White 2.
2131000	2133000	By the way, Loki's comment about having a washer and dryer
2133000	2136000	so he could now piss himself with joy was hilarious.
2136000	2139000	Another email comment, Olive Garden Home of the Never Ending Salads
2139000	2140000	was funny, too.
2140000	2144000	P.S. I think Rob is rad and Kmart sucks, LOLs.
2144000	2146000	I think Cheeseburgers are rad.
2146000	2148000	I like Cheeseburgers in Paradise.
2148000	2150000	As long as there's no mayonnaise on them, because mayonnaise is disgusting.
2150000	2152000	I like Cheeseburgers in Paradise.
2152000	2154000	What was the question? Civ 3, what is my perspective on Civ 3?
2154000	2156000	You don't have to be the Russians to build nuclear weapons.
2156000	2158000	Anybody builds nuclear weapons.
2158000	2160000	Hell, in the old school Civilization game,
2160000	2164000	I used to play as the Zulus or whatever, because they were green.
2164000	2165000	I liked green.
2165000	2167000	I used to play as them, and I would make nuclear weapons
2167000	2169000	and nuke the shit out of the Americans.
2169000	2172000	I always like to win by global domination.
2172000	2174000	Of course, there are multiple ways to win the game.
2174000	2177000	I think you get the most points for being the first person in space,
2177000	2180000	but that's not nearly as fun as global domination.
2180000	2185000	My favorite thing to do in Civilization is I like to treat everybody really nice.
2185000	2187000	I'm like, oh, sure, we'll trade with you.
2187000	2190000	Let's sign a peace treaty. Oh, we love you.
2190000	2194000	Then I will take a bunch of army units right outside their city,
2194000	2197000	and then I'll nuke the shit out of them.
2197000	2201000	We actually got one last email that we got last minute.
2201000	2202000	I'm going to read it.
2202000	2208000	It's not signed, so I'm just going to say it's from G. Davis, I guess.
2208000	2209000	Okay.
2209000	2213000	LLOLR, after listening to your guys' and Jamie's thoughts on DDR on last week's show,
2213000	2217000	I cannot help but feel like I need to say I completely agree.
2217000	2220000	DDR hasn't changed drastically since Sixth Mix.
2220000	2223000	However, Seventh Mix is my favorite mix and will always be smile face.
2223000	2231000	The thing that made DDR so much fun to play was the cheesy dance mania pop that was in it.
2231000	2236000	After seeing the list of licensed songs in the arcade version of Supernova 2,
2236000	2240000	I have to say that I am not excited for it because a lot of it is shitty mainstream music.
2240000	2243000	Linkin Park and DDR equals WTF.
2243000	2246000	The same goes for the home versions.
2246000	2251000	Most casual gamers I know think Guitar Hero is the best rhythm game because it has real songs in it,
2251000	2256000	and when they heard that the home version of Supernova 2 had Britney Spears, Gwen Stefani, and Justin Timberlake,
2256000	2259000	they said Guitar Hero had good real music.
2259000	2264000	However, they also said that Captain Jack Harchin here is most of the other dance mania tracks for some of their favorite songs in DDR.
2264000	2269000	I don't think this crappy mainstream pop is appealing to anyone except for 12-year-old girls.
2269000	2274000	Also, Rob, what innovations would you put in DDR because I've always been curious as to what they are.
2274000	2279000	One of my favorite things about DDR is the sheer simplicity of it so anybody could jump in and play.
2279000	2283000	I think too many changes might ruin that part of DDR.
2283000	2287000	Well, I've said this a million times on the show, but I know you might be a newer listener or what have you.
2287000	2289000	We've been doing the show a long time, so it feels like a million,
2289000	2293000	but I think the best way they could innovate DDR is that right now the way DDR is,
2293000	2295000	it has a lot of cooperative modes in the game.
2295000	2298000	There's a lot of cooperative dancing, a lot of cooperative.
2298000	2301000	I think the way for DDR to innovate is to make it more of a competitive game,
2301000	2304000	and that way tournaments can be based more around the competition element.
2304000	2307000	Now, yes, I understand there's Dance Magic in DDR Disney,
2307000	2312000	and I believe there was a mode similar to it in some of the later home versions that they did for DDR.
2312000	2318000	However, these versions have always been add-ons or tack-ons and not the focus of the game itself.
2318000	2325000	I think there ought to be some type of dance battle or something that the game could focus on,
2325000	2328000	to take in some ideas and innovating from that.
2328000	2332000	Maybe even in one-player mode you do battle against the computer.
2332000	2337000	Some of the games like Bust-A-Groove worked is that you were always battling somebody else
2337000	2338000	to see who was the better dancer.
2338000	2340000	And they did it better in the second one.
2340000	2344000	Yeah, and I think that could be a new direction for DDR where they could innovate,
2344000	2348000	yet keep the core element of the game stomping on arrows the same.
2348000	2350000	Second Mix had it.
2350000	2352000	Dance battle.
2352000	2353000	It wasn't quite the same, though.
2353000	2355000	It's a start, but it's not.
2355000	2360000	Those types of things have always been add-ons and not the focus of the game, if you know what I mean.
2360000	2362000	I still think there should be a single-player type of mode in there,
2362000	2365000	but I also agree about the music selections.
2365000	2367000	Having some of the mainstream stuff is nice,
2367000	2370000	but I think the dance mania stuff is always where it was at.
2370000	2371000	And a different drum, too.
2371000	2372000	Can't forget them.
2372000	2375000	But, boy, I really ruffled some feathers in my comments last week, though,
2375000	2377000	from some of the hardcore DDR people.
2377000	2379000	I've seen a few comments.
2379000	2381000	Unfortunately, I stand by what I said.
2381000	2383000	I know it's tough to hear, but...
2383000	2385000	Super DDR Fighter II Turbo.
2385000	2391000	It's time for DDR to innovate or go away.
2391000	2393000	I hate to say that, but...
2393000	2395000	God, it really pains me to say that, actually.
2395000	2398000	But if they're not going to innovate, I'm just not interested anymore.
2398000	2400000	They've got their market with those 12-year-old girls, though.
2400000	2401000	Hooray.
2401000	2402000	Well, they can enjoy it.
2402000	2403000	Yeah, really.
2403000	2404000	That's it.
2404000	2405000	All right.
2405000	2408000	Well, let's get back into some gaming news, then.
2408000	2410000	And we'll go to Loki.
2410000	2411000	Anyways.
2411000	2413000	So we talked about this before.
2413000	2418000	God's already had it for a while now, but we finally just got it in time for Christmas.
2418000	2425000	You'll be able to send virtual console games to friends on your friends list,
2425000	2429000	barring that you have their Wii friend code.
2429000	2433000	But you can gift wonderful virtual console games.
2433000	2437000	So I'm sure once Guardian Legend comes out,
2437000	2441000	you'll have 30 copies of Guardian Legend coming to you from all your friends.
2441000	2444000	I have no problem with this.
2444000	2447000	No word, though, and I haven't heard about this before.
2447000	2449000	What happens if you already have the game?
2449000	2451000	I guess you're just out of luck.
2451000	2452000	Perhaps.
2452000	2453000	I don't know.
2453000	2454000	Or, well...
2454000	2459000	No, I want to say I have heard that what happens if you already have the game
2459000	2463000	is that you actually can't send the game to your friend.
2463000	2466000	Like, when you try to gift it to them, it'll just bounce back and say,
2466000	2469000	you can't gift this because they already have it, or something along those lines.
2469000	2471000	Well, then.
2471000	2474000	I can't guarantee that, though, but I'm pretty sure that's what I read.
2474000	2475000	So there you go.
2475000	2478000	If you're interested in doing this, it's just like buying a normal virtual console game,
2478000	2480000	which is when you're about to pay for it.
2480000	2483000	It will ask you if it's for yourself or for someone else.
2483000	2488000	If it's for someone else, you just specify who, and they'll take care of the rest.
2488000	2490000	There are some things you can gift for free.
2490000	2494000	Like, you could send the photo channel version 1.1.
2494000	2497000	You could gift that to people, because even when you go in there,
2497000	2501000	I haven't tried it, but there's an option to either download or gift.
2501000	2506000	So if you're feeling cheap this Christmas, gift free things to your friends.
2506000	2509000	It's fun.
2509000	2511000	I like free.
2511000	2513000	I think you want to watch the Metroid channel.
2513000	2515000	The Metroid channel.
2515000	2519000	I would watch the Metroid channel if that were a real TV channel.
2519000	2526000	Well, there is a little bit of news for people who like stuff on their iPhone,
2526000	2528000	and I'm...
2528000	2530000	Is that like stuff on my cat?
2530000	2532000	No.
2532000	2534000	It's as in emulation.
2534000	2537000	They are in the beta state, well, near the beta stage, I should say,
2537000	2540000	for an iPhone PS1 emulator,
2540000	2547000	and it's called PSX number 4 iPhone emulator.
2547000	2552000	They're still working on it, but hopefully they'll have something out soon
2552000	2554000	for all of you who want to do it,
2554000	2560000	but their goal is to have it 75% compatible with all of the...
2560000	2566000	Well, I'd have to say, compatible with 75% of the list of PS1 games that are out.
2566000	2570000	So, hey, that'd be nice, but you know what?
2570000	2574000	I'm not going to download it unless something that Apple puts out.
2574000	2577000	RastoUT in chat says, unless you can plug a controller in the iPhone,
2577000	2579000	do not want...
2579000	2582000	Looking at the screen for this that they have on here,
2582000	2586000	and I'll go ahead and link that in the chat room,
2586000	2592000	they've got D-pads and your trigger buttons on the screen itself,
2592000	2599000	sort of running behind the game stuff itself,
2599000	2601000	so that still doesn't...
2601000	2604000	I don't think it's going to work, so...
2604000	2606000	I don't think that it'll be very playable.
2606000	2609000	The Nintendo one, I understand. It actually was okay.
2609000	2612000	The Nintendo one looks rad. If I had an iPhone, I'd do it, except for the fact that,
2612000	2615000	you know, then Apple will put the curse of death on my phone, probably.
2615000	2616000	Yeah, I don't want to brick my phone.
2616000	2617000	Well, exactly.
2617000	2619000	You already have the curse of death if you have an iPhone anyway, so...
2619000	2620000	Shut up.
2620000	2623000	I haven't had a single problem with mine.
2623000	2626000	Oh, shiz. All right, more news.
2626000	2629000	Less Apple debate, more news.
2629000	2634000	Anyways, let's see here.
2634000	2638000	There's going to be some new maps, apparently, for Team Fortress 2 coming,
2638000	2642000	as well as some more fixes, because you can't fix that game enough.
2642000	2645000	But that's kind of cool that they're having new maps, because I remember before,
2645000	2648000	they only had, like, what, three maps? So that kind of sucks.
2648000	2653000	But now, let's see here, they're talking about some different fixes
2653000	2657000	that they're going to be having, including several gameplay exploits,
2657000	2662000	plus other stuff to improve bandwidth usage and improve stats reporting,
2662000	2665000	and I guess some menu bugs.
2665000	2669000	I didn't really say, though, what the different levels are going to be yet,
2669000	2672000	but I'm sure we'll find that out soon, because I don't think it's officially been announced.
2672000	2674000	Oh, my God, I do want this.
2674000	2677000	What are you freaking out about over there, Dark Soccer?
2677000	2682000	I was looking at Valve's website, and they have Aperture Science cups,
2682000	2685000	and I do want one.
2685000	2690000	It's funny, because, like, all the passion she had for DDR at one time,
2690000	2692000	she now has for Portal. It's amazing.
2692000	2694000	You know what would be fucking awesome?
2694000	2699000	Like, you know how they have those stupid little light-sensored things,
2699000	2704000	like the stupid frogs and stuff that you walk in front of, and they ribbit at you and stuff?
2704000	2708000	They need one of those sentry guns or whatever, so when you walk past, it's all,
2708000	2711000	Hello, who's there?
2711000	2716000	And do all that stuff, and pop up, and we need to make that happen.
2716000	2717000	That'd be pretty sweet.
2717000	2719000	All right, well, I've got a couple of stories for you guys.
2719000	2723000	One thing I want to say is that the Word of the Year has been released by Miriam Webster,
2723000	2726000	and of course, Webster is the folks that make the dictionary, right?
2726000	2727000	Webster's Dictionary.
2727000	2729000	They have released their Word of the Year,
2729000	2734000	and the reason why this relates to gaming is that the Word of the Year is Woot.
2734000	2740000	That's right, W-0-0-T, Woot, is the Word of the Year.
2740000	2742000	I don't think I need to define what Woot means.
2742000	2745000	Most gamers know Woot is like a celebration thing,
2745000	2748000	and I'm just thinking, I always think about Woot.com, too, the store.
2748000	2749000	You know what they have?
2749000	2751000	This is going to be great business for them,
2751000	2753000	to be the guy that owns Woot.com right now.
2753000	2757000	The runner-up, by the way, was Facebook, but using it as a verb,
2757000	2759000	like you're going to Facebook somebody.
2759000	2762000	But I always thought saying you were going to MySpace somebody
2762000	2763000	was a more popular verb to use.
2763000	2765000	I'd just say friend somebody.
2765000	2766000	Really?
2766000	2769000	Yeah, I think that's a good thing to say.
2769000	2772000	Turn a noun into a verb.
2772000	2774000	Exactly.
2774000	2776000	All right, well, another story I've got for you guys real quick
2776000	2781000	is that Fall 2008 is now the rumored time that Killzone 2
2781000	2785000	and LittleBigPlanet are both supposed to be coming out.
2785000	2788000	This was from a recent post on 3Speech, which, as you know,
2788000	2790000	is the PlayStation blog.
2790000	2793000	I guess it's kind of their major Nelson-ish thing.
2793000	2794000	It's their semi-official official blog.
2794000	2795000	Semi-official, yeah.
2795000	2796000	Yeah, it's their blog.
2796000	2799000	We're totally independent, but we're owned by something.
2799000	2801000	Apparently, LittleBigPlanet and Killzone 2 are not coming out
2801000	2805000	until September or October next year.
2805000	2808000	That's a pretty big difference from early 2008,
2808000	2810000	which was the original time for LittleBigPlanet.
2810000	2813000	But then again, pushback should be no new news to Sony,
2813000	2815000	or really gaming in general.
2815000	2817000	It wouldn't be fair to pick on Sony in that department.
2817000	2821000	Hello, Super Smash Bros. Brawl, right?
2821000	2822000	Yeah.
2822000	2824000	But it just kind of sucks for sales because, again,
2824000	2827000	without really, really killer applications,
2827000	2831000	PlayStation 3s aren't going to move off-shells any faster.
2831000	2833000	Well, no, all the stuff that they're promising us,
2833000	2836000	you know, that was supposed to be coming out so people would buy these systems.
2836000	2839000	You know, I'm sure you've seen the trailers for,
2839000	2842000	like, the third-party stuff that they have for PlayStation 3 now,
2842000	2846000	where they're advertising Metal Gear Solid 4 like it's out right now,
2846000	2849000	even though it doesn't come out until, what, like, shit,
2849000	2850000	I don't even know if they have an official announcement.
2850000	2851000	A long time.
2851000	2853000	Yeah, probably, like, March-ish, so.
2853000	2855000	Quick clarifications from our chat room.
2855000	2858000	RasteelUT says three speeches Sony Europe,
2858000	2862000	Sony USA is PlayStation.blog.
2862000	2863000	Well, fine.
2863000	2865000	But it's still Sony, no matter what country you're in.
2865000	2867000	Well, if that's the case, then who knows, you know,
2867000	2870000	a little big planet in Killzone being delayed to, like, the fall, you know,
2870000	2871000	Europe's always getting the shaft.
2871000	2872000	That's true.
2872000	2874000	Europe always gets the shaft in that department,
2874000	2877000	but I don't know, even, that's a long shaft,
2877000	2880000	if they're not getting them until the end of the year,
2880000	2881000	and we're getting them at the beginning of the year.
2881000	2883000	Well, here's the thing I want to note.
2883000	2886000	I'm not sure if SingStar is already out now in Europe.
2886000	2889000	I know it's not here for the PlayStation 3 at least.
2889000	2891000	Maybe they're just having trouble with, like,
2891000	2893000	the network infrastructure or something like that,
2893000	2896000	because, you know, those things like Home, you know,
2896000	2899000	SingStar, this little big planet and stuff
2899000	2901000	that's going to have a lot of, like, you know,
2901000	2904000	network backend stuff is not coming out.
2904000	2909000	Is it sad that I kind of sort of want a PlayStation 3 for SingStar?
2909000	2910000	Yes, it is sad.
2910000	2913000	Seeing as there's countless versions for the PlayStation 2,
2913000	2915000	why the fuck do you need the PlayStation 3?
2915000	2917000	Because of the whole, like, I know my friends.
2917000	2918000	Oh, because you can upload videos to YouTube.
2918000	2920000	Yes, and I want to do that to my friends.
2920000	2923000	I want to upload videos, you know, to any other site.
2923000	2925000	It's just like uploading videos to YouTube.
2925000	2926000	Well, how about this?
2926000	2929000	Why don't you actually upload videos to YouTube?
2929000	2931000	Guess what? It's free to do that.
2931000	2933000	Instead of having to buy a game.
2933000	2935000	Oh, fine. Shut up.
2935000	2936000	Actually, it's...
2936000	2939000	Why don't you buy, you know, fucking SingStar right now,
2939000	2941000	because, hell, you get the microphones.
2941000	2942000	They work with the PlayStation 3.
2942000	2943000	Sephiroth1215 says,
2943000	2945000	Rob, just play Rock Band.
2945000	2947000	Ironically enough, I was playing Rock Band last night.
2947000	2948000	One of my friends was filming me,
2948000	2951000	and I wouldn't be surprised if that shit ended up on MySpace TV,
2951000	2952000	or YouTube, or any of that stuff,
2952000	2955000	but I hope not, because I look like an idiot when I play Rock Band.
2955000	2956000	Especially the singing.
2956000	2958000	I was horrible.
2958000	2960000	Horrible, because none of those songs are in my key.
2960000	2962000	I would just like to share.
2964000	2966000	I remember you singing something in karaoke
2966000	2969000	that was completely out of your key that you did, because I asked you to.
2969000	2971000	I got to interrupt the show real quick.
2971000	2972000	Fine.
2972000	2974000	But this is talking about Rock Band.
2974000	2976000	Irene doing sabotage.
2976000	2978000	Oh, my God.
2978000	2980000	I hope that's on video somewhere,
2980000	2983000	because that could possibly be funnier than the I'm staying in
2983000	2985000	that you did a long time ago.
2985000	2987000	That was so funny.
2987000	2990000	It was hard to play the drums and listen to that.
2990000	2993000	She's fucking hardcore. I love it.
2993000	2994000	Now, what were you going to say?
2994000	2997000	You sang Birdhouse in Your Soul for me.
2997000	2999000	I love that song.
2999000	3000000	Half of it's in my key.
3000000	3001000	All right.
3001000	3002000	You did a good job on it, I have to say.
3002000	3003000	But anyway.
3003000	3005000	We should go to karaoke again sometime.
3005000	3006000	Let's go, although I won't sing.
3006000	3007000	That's fine.
3007000	3008000	We can drink.
3008000	3011000	I hope that that one guy, though, who has that really, really good voice
3011000	3016000	that sang Always and Forever is there.
3016000	3018000	Let's go, and I can sing, and you can drink.
3018000	3020000	Okay, that means you drive.
3020000	3021000	Fair enough.
3021000	3022000	All right, moving on, news.
3022000	3024000	Okay.
3024000	3027000	Actually, this is sort of...
3027000	3031000	Well, it's old news if they're on your DeviantArt friends list,
3031000	3037000	but UdonKru has been working on new Street Fighter comics,
3037000	3039000	and they have been for quite some time.
3039000	3043000	In 2008, there's a Street Fighter II Turbo comic that is to be out,
3043000	3047000	and I really, really love the work that UdonKru has done on this.
3047000	3049000	They're also bringing out, though,
3049000	3054000	a lot of the different comics that are from overseas,
3054000	3057000	but they're also doing a Street Fighter Legends one
3057000	3063000	that's different focus comics on different ones.
3063000	3071000	They're also doing one for Street Fighter III.
3071000	3077000	They're also bringing out some of the other collections that came out overseas,
3077000	3081000	like they've been doing Sakura Ganbaru,
3081000	3084000	which I read a long time ago in scans,
3084000	3088000	but it's pretty cool.
3088000	3089000	All righty.
3089000	3093000	Pretty cool.
3093000	3095000	Yeah, you can also go on DeviantArt,
3095000	3099000	and you can add Udon to your friends list,
3099000	3101000	and I'll get the name in a sec.
3101000	3103000	All right.
3103000	3104000	Let's see here.
3104000	3108000	Now, there's some interesting news coming out about Grand Theft Auto IV.
3108000	3112000	They've rated it in Australia already, MA15+,
3112000	3114000	which is good for two reasons.
3114000	3117000	One, it's not going to be adults only over there, at least,
3117000	3120000	and I know a lot of games get banned in Australia.
3120000	3124000	Two, the fact that it's actually been rated, first off,
3124000	3127000	may indicate that it's actually coming out soon,
3127000	3130000	and possibly within the time frame that they had originally said,
3130000	3132000	which was April,
3132000	3135000	although the other thing, 3Speech, I believe,
3135000	3138000	said that Grand Theft Auto IV was coming out around the same time
3138000	3141000	as Killzone 2 and LittleBigPlanet,
3141000	3143000	so I hope that's not true.
3143000	3147000	I hope it's actually coming out before holiday 2008.
3147000	3148000	Go spring release.
3148000	3149000	Come on.
3149000	3153000	I need to play this game.
3153000	3154000	I found it, by the way.
3154000	3155000	What's that?
3155000	3156000	It's udoncrew.deviantart.com.
3156000	3157000	I heard it is.
3157000	3162000	I find a lot of their art wallets in progress, too.
3162000	3164000	Well, save the last minute stories.
3164000	3166000	That is going to do it for our news tonight,
3166000	3167000	and you know what that means.
3167000	3169000	It's time to open up the telephones
3169000	3170000	and let you guys have a say.
3170000	3173000	If you'd like to give us a call, it's 1-877-GAME-OLR.
3173000	3175000	Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
3175000	3177000	We've been doing the Skype thing for a long time.
3177000	3179000	Of course, Skype is a free program
3179000	3181000	that allows you to call us using your computer if you have a headset.
3181000	3183000	However, if you are going to use Skype,
3183000	3185000	I encourage you, if you've never called the show before,
3185000	3189000	please call ECHO123 on Skype first,
3189000	3191000	because that way you can test your connection,
3191000	3194000	and when you call us, you don't sound like shite.
3194000	3196000	But in the meantime, we have a call, and let's take that call.
3196000	3197000	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.
3197000	3199000	Who's this?
3199000	3201000	It's Ronbo. How are you guys doing tonight?
3201000	3203000	Good, Ronbo. How are you doing, my friend?
3203000	3205000	Good, good, good.
3205000	3209000	Last week I went to my final anime con of the year,
3209000	3211000	and I have some gaming stuffs for you.
3211000	3214000	Really? You got me stuffs?
3214000	3216000	Yeah, I mean, just some gaming information.
3216000	3219000	It's not much, because I was working the whole weekend,
3219000	3221000	because my roommate has a company now,
3221000	3224000	so I was helping him peddle his wares.
3224000	3227000	Cool. Well, what kind of stuffs?
3227000	3230000	Well, first off, I was talking to a couple of people
3230000	3233000	that were running the gaming room at New York Anime Fest,
3233000	3235000	and things were a little bit different.
3235000	3239000	They wanted to be different from normal gaming rooms,
3239000	3242000	so there was no Bimani there this year,
3242000	3247000	including no rock band or guitar hero or anything like that.
3247000	3249000	Good for them taking a stand, because honestly,
3249000	3250000	most of the people that go to those cons
3250000	3253000	have all that shit at home, don't they?
3253000	3254000	Pretty much.
3254000	3256000	So there you go.
3256000	3261000	They had more anime-based games and other RPGs and stuff,
3261000	3263000	but there were a couple of instances
3263000	3267000	that did happen in the gaming room from what I was told.
3267000	3273000	A DS got stolen with a game that was in development,
3273000	3276000	and some other guy tried to steal another DS,
3276000	3278000	but he got caught doing it.
3278000	3280000	Aw, you know that DS game in development's
3280000	3282000	going to be up on the internet any day now.
3282000	3284000	Probably you're already up there.
3284000	3286000	I don't even know which game it was.
3286000	3288000	Interesting.
3288000	3291000	Also, while I was there,
3291000	3293000	I was working for a couple other websites,
3293000	3296000	and one of my friends runs a site called Gaming Angels,
3296000	3299000	so I was running around getting pictures
3299000	3302000	of female cosplayers doing gaming stuffs.
3302000	3305000	I could tell you the most popular gaming cosplayers
3305000	3310000	pretty much was Yuna from Final Fantasy X and Final Fantasy X-2.
3310000	3312000	That's kind of not a surprise.
3312000	3316000	I've seen a lot of Yunas of all shapes and sizes at anime cons.
3316000	3317000	Pretty much.
3317000	3319000	Here's a picture I'm about to post in the chat room
3319000	3320000	of something interesting.
3320000	3325000	There's one girl I met who did Lolita Link for Legend of Zelda.
3325000	3327000	Lolita Link?
3327000	3328000	Yep, Lolita Link.
3328000	3330000	I just posted a link in the chat.
3330000	3331000	This I have to see.
3331000	3333000	Yeah, that was great.
3333000	3335000	That's interesting.
3335000	3339000	Yay, Slutty Link.
3339000	3343000	This next picture is for you.
3343000	3346000	Since this is horrible radio, when you send pictures,
3346000	3348000	describe for our listeners what you're sending.
3348000	3353000	The second picture is a person cosplaying night.
3353000	3354000	Nice.
3354000	3355000	I did see that one.
3355000	3357000	That's cute.
3357000	3362000	This next one is a picture of a prize that you probably enjoyed
3362000	3364000	when I sent it to your cell phone.
3364000	3370000	This is my friend dressed up as Pit from Smash Bros. Ball.
3370000	3373000	I got a random text message from Rama over the weekend
3373000	3375000	with a lady dressed as Pit.
3375000	3376000	That's hardcore, though.
3376000	3377000	I like that.
3377000	3378000	Good for her.
3378000	3380000	I hope she wants something.
3380000	3383000	I'm not sure, but I can always ask because she's a good friend of mine.
3383000	3386000	I know Jamie is a big fan of Silent Hill,
3386000	3389000	so I found the girl who did Pyramid Head.
3389000	3392000	That's cool, yeah.
3392000	3397000	The last two pictures, I got to say, are my personal favorites.
3397000	3398000	You like Final Fight?
3398000	3399000	Oh, yeah.
3399000	3402000	I've got almost every version that they put out at home.
3402000	3405000	Well, there's this guy walking around with a shirt that says,
3405000	3408000	I got OA on the front.
3408000	3412000	And on the back, it says, and I quote,
3412000	3416000	a turkey in every horror drum and a fist in every face.
3416000	3418000	Yes.
3418000	3419000	That was great.
3419000	3423000	That's great.
3423000	3426000	I like how it's just some dude wearing this shirt like,
3426000	3428000	yeah, I got my Haggar OA shirt.
3428000	3430000	A turkey in every oil drum and a fist in every face.
3430000	3434000	That's amazing.
3434000	3435000	I want that shirt.
3435000	3436000	He should market that.
3436000	3438000	Some other folks in chat are saying they want that shirt, too.
3438000	3440000	That shirt is fantastic.
3440000	3442000	Well, since the pictures are posted,
3442000	3444000	maybe I'll end up hearing from the guy.
3444000	3446000	I could find out more information about the shirt.
3446000	3450000	I have a feeling he made it himself, which is pretty damn cool.
3450000	3452000	You know, I was just thinking, you know, at Orange Lawns Radio,
3452000	3454000	we should open a t-shirt shop and not just sell official
3454000	3456000	Orange Lawns Radio t-shirts like finally,
3456000	3459000	but really funny gamer nerd shirts such as that.
3459000	3461000	Now, I mean, obviously we wouldn't steal that idea,
3461000	3464000	but we could come up with other things that are just as funny, right?
3464000	3465000	Like, we should get a shirt that says,
3465000	3467000	Rate Me Pyramid Head on it,
3467000	3470000	with a little chibi pyramid head on it.
3470000	3473000	I mean, I'd wear that in public, wouldn't you?
3473000	3474000	I definitely would.
3474000	3475000	See?
3475000	3477000	I ran across this shirt this weekend that said,
3477000	3480000	Mario, Luigi, oh, wait.
3480000	3483000	And by the way, patent pending on the Rate Me Pyramid Head shirt.
3483000	3486000	If you steal that idea, I'll sue you for a million dollars.
3486000	3487000	We have it. We have proof.
3487000	3488000	It's being recorded.
3488000	3489000	Exactly.
3489000	3490000	All right.
3490000	3491000	Well, Rahm, anything else you want to share with our listeners?
3491000	3493000	I'm glad to hear you had fun at the con.
3493000	3494000	I'm glad.
3494000	3499000	That's pretty much it, and we want the New York chapter of OLR.
3499000	3501000	I want you guys to come out to Anime Next,
3501000	3504000	and we're working with some friends to try to get you guys out here.
3504000	3506000	When is that?
3506000	3509000	I believe it's the first or second weekend of June.
3509000	3510000	They just announced their date.
3510000	3513000	Just in time for my birthday.
3513000	3515000	Hey, if you make it out for your birthday, we'll take you out.
3515000	3518000	I mean, I celebrate my birthday with you guys for fun,
3518000	3519000	and it's only fair, you know?
3519000	3521000	And speaking of which, are you coming back this year?
3521000	3525000	Because I do believe we were promised Rama in 08.
3525000	3527000	I thought I said 09.
3527000	3528000	I think it was 09.
3528000	3529000	Every other year.
3529000	3531000	I was trying to switch it up.
3531000	3532000	I'm sorry.
3532000	3534000	All right.
3534000	3535000	Have a good one, Rama.
3535000	3536000	Thanks for calling.
3536000	3537000	All right, you guys take care.
3537000	3538000	Bye-bye.
3538000	3539000	Bye.
3539000	3542000	DMN says Roberts and Summers in 08 would be the ticket.
3542000	3544000	I don't know what that leaves Loki to do.
3544000	3545000	Loki would have to be the official...
3545000	3547000	He'd be Secretary of State.
3547000	3548000	Well, he's court jester.
3548000	3549000	He is what he is.
3549000	3553000	He can be Speaker of the House.
3553000	3557000	Actually, he can be the pet at the White House, like Socks the Cat.
3557000	3558000	We have Loki.
3558000	3559000	I don't know.
3559000	3560000	Anyway, we've got another caller.
3560000	3561000	Jeremy!
3561000	3562000	All right, fine.
3562000	3563000	Jeremy is the official pet.
3563000	3564000	Let me get to the caller.
3564000	3565000	Hi, you're on Orange House Radio.
3565000	3566000	Who's this?
3566000	3567000	GS68.
3567000	3568000	Oh my God, GS68.
3568000	3570000	You've been on the show in many ways tonight.
3570000	3573000	Now you're calling us when you were already on the mailbag?
3573000	3574000	It's all good.
3574000	3575000	What's up?
3575000	3581000	First of all, I thought the ferret was the official pet of the caller.
3581000	3582000	Good point.
3582000	3583000	The ferret...
3583000	3584000	We don't know where the ferret is.
3584000	3587000	The ferret will not stab you in the face and in fact cannot speak.
3587000	3589000	The ferret is MIA.
3589000	3591000	And now we should sell shirts with ferrets on them.
3591000	3592000	And it's just a ferret.
3592000	3594000	Actually, I think I've seen that before.
3594000	3595000	Never mind, we can't do that.
3595000	3597000	I don't want to get sued.
3597000	3598000	What's on your mind?
3598000	3599000	Certainly you have something game-related.
3599000	3606000	Yeah, today I went to the GameStop Tournament Edition, which is what I like to call it.
3606000	3610000	Oh, you've been to the new place that we were talking about earlier in the program.
3610000	3611000	What was it like?
3611000	3613000	What was up with it?
3613000	3620000	First, there's a bottle of kiosks over there where you can play games and such.
3620000	3630000	Over in the house where you normally buy games and stuff, they also have a bunch of kiosks over there.
3630000	3636000	Now, did it look like a normal GameStop otherwise, with just a bunch of additional kiosks?
3636000	3645000	Well, actually, no, because they have this big stage where there's a whole bunch of gaming kiosks.
3645000	3650000	And I presume that's for tournaments and stuff.
3650000	3652000	Interesting.
3652000	3655000	I was going to ask about, was something going on?
3655000	3658000	Were they actually doing a tournament when you were there today, or was it just kind of open?
3658000	3659000	Actually, no.
3659000	3660000	It was a regular day.
3660000	3662000	So what did they do during the regular day?
3662000	3665000	Are they just open for people to play games for free?
3665000	3667000	Yeah, I guess.
3667000	3669000	Wow. That's kind of cool.
3669000	3678000	Yes, I was driving down to Stevens Creek, and what caught my attention was the subtitle under the GameStop logo by Barnes & Noble.
3678000	3680000	Where exactly is this GameStop located?
3680000	3687000	It's on the corner of San Tomas Expressway and Stevens Creek Boulevard in San Jose.
3687000	3689000	Oh, shit, I know where that is. That's funny.
3689000	3690000	Huh.
3690000	3695000	I might have to check that out at some point, because I go to, it's right next to the Barnes & Noble.
3695000	3699000	Yeah, I kind of know where that is. I go down that area quite often.
3699000	3704000	I go to Menlo Park almost every other week, so I might have to check that out. Very cool.
3704000	3709000	All right, well, anything else you want to share with our listeners after your trip today?
3709000	3710000	No.
3710000	3714000	All right, well, have a good one, and thanks for the first-hand report from being down there.
3714000	3715000	Thanks, you too.
3715000	3717000	All right, take care.
3717000	3722000	If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR. Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
3722000	3726000	Keep in mind that the 877 number is toll-free, but only for those folks in the U.S. and Canada.
3726000	3730000	I know we have listeners overseas. The 877 won't work for you, but you can use Skype.
3730000	3732000	Skype is international, and it's free.
3732000	3737000	While we wait for some calls, how about some last-minute stories? Anybody, last-minute story?
3737000	3739000	I like fire.
3739000	3740000	That's not news.
3740000	3748000	Well, there's apparently a possibility that an 18-plus version of No More Heroes may actually happen in the future for Europe,
3748000	3752000	so fear not. You may get your uncut version of the game.
3752000	3756000	There's a funny little Wiimote candy dispenser that's out there now.
3756000	3763000	If you go to candyaddict.com, you can buy a Wiimote candy dispenser.
3763000	3767000	Perfect gift for those kids who may not be able to get a Wii this Christmas.
3767000	3771000	Give them an IOU and a Wii candy dispenser.
3771000	3772000	What a shitty alternative.
3772000	3774000	Let's go to the phones. We have another call.
3774000	3776000	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
3776000	3778000	Hello, this is RosteelUT.
3778000	3781000	Hello, RosteelUT. What is on your mind?
3781000	3782000	Hello.
3782000	3788000	Not much. I was just looking at the November NPDs a few days ago,
3788000	3794000	and it's pretty damn shocking to see how well some of these games have turned out.
3794000	3798000	Call of Duty 4 has just been ridiculous.
3798000	3800000	There's been a lot of sales.
3800000	3804000	The one thing that's been on my mind, and I mentioned this earlier in the chat,
3804000	3808000	is that it's great that the Wii is selling all this hardware,
3808000	3810000	but is it really growing a market?
3810000	3815000	You look at all these games that are found, there's a lot of good third-party games.
3815000	3823000	It's not like there's nothing on there, but it's like nothing is found on a market.
3823000	3826000	The thing that gets to me is are these people ever going to buy games,
3826000	3831000	or is it just going to be the same people buying the same four games over and over again?
3831000	3835000	I think there are a shitload of people that are buying the system just for Wii Sports,
3835000	3838000	because that's the game that Nintendo's been very good at getting out there
3838000	3840000	and creating a fad out of.
3840000	3846000	Think about the way most people think about video games in their mind.
3846000	3851000	A lot of folks don't even realize that this thing is a system capable of playing a multitude of games,
3851000	3854000	but the way that it's been marketed to the soccer moms and everything is,
3854000	3858000	as Wii Sports, get up and move your butt while you play games.
3858000	3860000	Play fake tennis and all that stuff.
3860000	3864000	They've done an amazing job in that regard.
3864000	3868000	The question is, I mentioned Zack and Wiki in the chat.
3868000	3871000	I mentioned more heroes.
3871000	3875000	Even Rayman 2 has been doing pretty well, but not anywhere near as good as the first one,
3875000	3880000	which was launch titles, and launch titles always have a lucky streak.
3880000	3886000	If all we're getting is people buying it for Wii Sports,
3886000	3891000	is it ever going to be anything more than just a toy, basically?
3891000	3895000	Is it ever going to be anything that anyone who actually wants more than one game is going to want to have?
3895000	3900000	I do, because I think Nintendo is going to try to make Wii Fit the next fad.
3900000	3904000	My gut tells me, the way Nintendo's been going with the market lately,
3904000	3907000	I think they are really going to try and make Wii Fit massive.
3907000	3913000	They're going to try and get it out there on the Today Show and on Oprah and all that shit,
3913000	3917000	and that's going to be their next thing that they're going to push and try to get in every home.
3917000	3920000	I expect Wii Fit to do well.
3920000	3923000	All these stupid little fitness products always do well.
3923000	3929000	The question I'm asking is, you see the 360s, and even the PS3 to some extent.
3929000	3932000	The PS3 has you good selling games this month.
3932000	3937000	Is it ever going to be whether Wii is a vibrant market,
3937000	3943000	or is it just going to continue to be hostile to everybody who was Nintendo?
3943000	3947000	That's the real question.
3947000	3950000	You mentioned, of course, movie games and all that,
3950000	3956000	but a lot of people don't even look at the movie games.
3956000	3958000	It's shocking.
3958000	3961000	Even traditional high-selling games.
3961000	3964000	I was talking to this guy a couple of weeks ago.
3964000	3970000	EA butted heads with Nintendo so they could put the 32 multiplayer online in Medal of Honor Heroes 2.
3970000	3977000	They had the Madden online for 08 where it works with EA Nation instead of the friend codes,
3977000	3979000	and they're not being rewarded.
3979000	3983000	The third parties are trying, some of them.
3983000	3988000	Of course, no more Heroes is a tragedy.
3988000	3992000	Has that even been released here yet?
3992000	3994000	It was released in Japan.
3994000	3998000	Kotaku had a piece on it a couple of weeks ago,
3998000	4003000	where Suda51 actually went to a huge game store in Akihabara.
4003000	4004000	Nobody went there.
4004000	4006000	He was going to go sign games.
4006000	4009000	They had piles of toilet paper that you could buy or get for free.
4009000	4011000	Yeah, they were giving the toilet paper away.
4011000	4013000	They had a model.
4013000	4017000	It was a big launch event and nobody came.
4017000	4021000	That just made me sad, really.
4021000	4022000	It's not just that game.
4022000	4024000	It's Zack and Wiki.
4024000	4027000	One of my favorite games, Mercury Meltdown Revolution.
4027000	4029000	I don't think that sold very well.
4029000	4030000	Look at the box art for that game.
4030000	4034000	That isn't something that really jumps out at you as something you should buy.
4034000	4035000	What, Zack and Wiki?
4035000	4038000	No, the Mercury Meltdown Revolution.
4038000	4040000	Yeah, Mercury Meltdown.
4040000	4042000	I could see you with Mercury Meltdown.
4042000	4047000	But Zack and Wiki, that screams family friendly.
4047000	4050000	It's a very adorable looking game.
4050000	4053000	It's not that hard.
4053000	4061000	Yeah, Capcom could have advertised it better, but given the ridiculous sales of this system,
4061000	4066000	you'd think that more games would just sell on accident, considering how many of these
4066000	4067000	systems there are.
4067000	4071000	One thing the NPD doesn't account for, though, that I'd be curious to know a little more
4071000	4074000	is the virtual console sales.
4074000	4079000	I bet that's doing crazy business that if we saw the numbers, we'd get sick over the
4079000	4081000	fact that how many games people might use a cheaper...
4081000	4085000	Well, Nintendo mentioned that they made $33 million on the virtual console, which isn't
4085000	4086000	bad, considering.
4086000	4087000	I mean, shit.
4087000	4090000	That's not bad at all.
4090000	4097000	I would be very interested, considering how much of a hassle it is with the Wii to get
4097000	4102000	online sometimes, at least with the wireless, I do not understand why they didn't have an
4102000	4103000	Ethernet port right there.
4103000	4104000	I don't understand that.
4104000	4110000	That $33 million is literally free money to them, is literally free money right out of
4110000	4111000	thin air.
4111000	4112000	Of course.
4112000	4113000	It's all old games.
4113000	4118000	I mean, granted, they have to write those manuals and do the QA testing and all that
4118000	4122000	stuff, but that's pennies compared to the bigger picture, you know what I mean?
4122000	4126000	I'm sure a skill programmer could do that in an hour.
4126000	4132000	That's my concern, because I have all three systems.
4132000	4142440	I want Nintendo to be successful, but I don't want a system that nobody's buying games for
4142440	4149760	eventually taking the rest of the industry down with it, because you see the trends.
4149760	4154880	You see more of these little minigame crap coming out, and personally, I don't blame
4154880	4158680	the third parties, because if they're not going to get big sales, they may as well go for
4158680	4160680	the quick buck.
4160680	4170880	But that could end up hurting the Wii after the Wii Sports fat is done or if the Wii Fit
4170880	4175360	doesn't work very well here.
4175360	4179440	Nintendo is riding on the real thin ground if they don't at least try to get the quality
4179440	4186440	control up and try to help people realize, hey, this thing has other games.
4186440	4188440	Mario Galaxy didn't do as well in Japan.
4188440	4190440	What the hell?
4190440	4194480	That is a little bit surprising.
4194480	4202120	I thought Mario Galaxy was going to do a million in a week, honestly, because it's Mario.
4202120	4203680	It's freaking Mario.
4203680	4208080	Anyways, I've been ranting too long, and I'm sure a whole lot of people want to get on
4208080	4210080	the line, so I'll see you next week, all right?
4210080	4211080	All right.
4211080	4212080	We've got to let you go anyway for time, but take care, buddy.
4212080	4213080	Thanks for the phone.
4213080	4214080	You're doing fine.
4214080	4215080	Bye-bye.
4215080	4216080	Bye-bye.
4216080	4217080	All right.
4217080	4218080	I think that's actually going to do it for calls tonight, because we're running a little
4218080	4220920	bit long tonight, so we're going to go ahead and start to wrap up the program.
4220920	4224400	I do want to check and see if there's any more last-minute stories.
4224400	4226160	Yeah.
4226160	4227160	Let's see here real quick.
4227160	4230440	I was just going to mention a few things that were kind of funny.
4230440	4235480	There's actually a game coming out in Europe, and this is really sad, called MTV Fan Attack,
4235480	4245800	and it looks like you're a VJ running from fans, interesting, wonderful shit, and then
4245800	4249720	this will piss off my wife really bad.
4249720	4255080	Her big complaint, you remember, Rob, you probably remember her complaint about this,
4255080	4256840	the Golden Compass movie.
4256840	4260060	Apparently, the ending was not like the book.
4260060	4267120	There's a major scene that's cut out of the movie, not to give away any spoilers, but
4267120	4268120	I will.
4268120	4273880	Apparently, a kid gets killed or sacrificed to open a portal.
4273880	4279600	Hey, if that wasn't a portal, that would make the game even better, sacrificing bratty kids,
4279600	4284880	but apparently that footage, though, is in the game if you finish the game, so I will
4284880	4288560	have to show this to her tonight, and I'm sure a director's cut of the movie will be
4288560	4294320	in order.
4294320	4298320	Anything else from Last Minute News Tonight?
4298320	4301520	No, that's a Famitsu cover.
4301520	4309520	That's kind of funny for No More Heroes, and then they have a new wallpaper up on the No
4309520	4313880	More Heroes website, which this will now be my new wallpaper, if Rob would want to take
4313880	4321720	a look here with him charging his beam saber.
4321720	4326080	Dark Soccer, do you have anything last minute for us?
4326080	4327080	I like pie.
4327080	4330080	That's not a spoiler.
4330080	4331080	No.
4331080	4332080	All right.
4332080	4338560	Anyhow, let's go around and get final thoughts for our program, because we're going to wrap
4338560	4340400	this up and call it a week.
4340400	4342280	Loki, your final thought?
4342280	4345680	I hope we can fix my computer situation early.
4345680	4350680	I actually thought of something during the show that I need to check on, because my power
4350680	4354040	supply apparently has a turbo mode on it, and a normal mode.
4354040	4359520	The normal mode has the 12 volt rail broken up into four different rails, whereas turbo
4359520	4364720	has it on one, and I'm wondering if I maybe switch that if it'll work, although I still
4364720	4369080	think that the motherboard or graphics card is broken, so we'll see.
4369080	4374200	I get to play tons of games this week, taking Wednesday through Friday off to play games.
4374200	4377280	My final thought is I have a two and a half week vacation coming up.
4377280	4381320	I just have to get through one more week of work to get there, and I'm so excited, and
4381320	4385880	I'm going to play a lot of games too, and I'm going to work on Orange Lawn's radio stuffs,
4385880	4386880	which will be fun.
4386880	4387880	Jamie, your final thought?
4387880	4393840	I need to get Orange Box on PC so I can use the editor to put the Half-Life 2 maps in
4393840	4396960	Portal and use the Portal gun in Half-Life.
4396960	4398360	Fun.
4398360	4399360	You get to work on that.
4399360	4400360	All right.
4400360	4401360	Eventually.
4401360	4402360	Eventually.
4402360	4406600	All right, well, thank you very much for tuning into our program tonight and supporting independent
4406600	4408040	podcasting and independent radio.
4408040	4409040	We really appreciate it.
4409040	4412760	Remember, if you like our show, tell two people you know about the program.
4412760	4416600	That way, we slowly begin to take over the world as more and more people discover our
4416600	4417600	little program.
4417600	4422400	Remember, there will be no live show next week with us on December 23rd.
4422400	4428200	There will be something for the live listeners on the stream with some of our other OLR personalities,
4428200	4430520	but Dark Soccer and myself and Loki will have the night off.
4430520	4435760	So we will see you back on the podcast on December 30th for the year-end review show.
4435760	4436760	So see you then.
4436760	4437760	Bye-bye.
4437760	4438760	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
