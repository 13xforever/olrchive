Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, December the 16th of 2007.

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
In the last segment we had a bunch of fun news.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
We gave out our inaugural Stupid Awards, so check that out in part A.

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
Also we talked a little bit about the Wii and those rain checks.

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
Talking about Activision and harmonics not being able to get along.

00:36.000 --> 00:37.000
But that's all in part A.

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
We're going to kick off part B tonight with some Squeenix news.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.000
Yes, Loki?

00:41.000 --> 00:42.000
Yes.

00:42.000 --> 00:46.000
In fact, I don't know if you might remember this video from a while ago.

00:46.000 --> 00:51.000
Temptation Sonata had a very, very annoying song to it with this...

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
I kind of like this song.

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
I believe it was even a cage match pick at one time.

00:57.000 --> 01:05.000
Anyways, you may remember that the video featured blatant rip-offs of scenes from Advent Children.

01:05.000 --> 01:12.000
Well, apparently Squeenix won a case against them for plagiarism.

01:12.000 --> 01:21.000
And to the tune of 16 million won, or $17,400.

01:21.000 --> 01:26.000
I guess the one is pesos, apparently.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
So, yeah.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
Oh well.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
$17,000.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
That's not bad.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
But the video was pretty cool.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
I mean, I don't know if you saw it.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
I've seen it.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
It was neat.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
She had two other good songs on the album, too.

01:39.000 --> 01:44.000
It was neat because it was Advent Children, but other than that it was...

01:44.000 --> 01:50.000
Here's a little clip of the song, which I know does not do very well for a radio that

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
we're looking at a little component of the video here in studio.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
Actually, maybe we won't.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
It doesn't want to play.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
It's probably because operator plagiarized.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
Oh, is it really?

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
I have the whole album.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
Oh.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
It's Ivy.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
We don't have to take a look at that.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
Oh, that's okay.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
It's not that important.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
It's track two on the album.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
There we go.

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
Ah, it's just not even in the song yet.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
Forget it.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
Operator 11, our bandwidth screwed thanks to them.

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
Yeah, it's alright.

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
I'm not that worried about it because I want to talk more about this.

02:24.000 --> 02:33.000
Forget Square Enix winning all this money from this poor Korean chick who's singing.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
I mean, whatever happened at the same time?

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
Invitation is the finest form of flattery.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
Have you ever heard that?

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
Well, if you imitate it so well that, yeah.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
Alright, well, anyhow.

02:42.000 --> 02:46.000
Final Fantasy IV is getting a sequel, and this to me is awesome news.

02:46.000 --> 02:51.000
I am so happy because Final Fantasy IV is my favorite in the entire Final Fantasy series.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
I know.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
Say what you will.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
Final Fantasy VII, rah rah rah.

02:55.000 --> 03:00.000
Final Fantasy IX, rah rah rah.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
There's always that back and forth.

03:01.000 --> 03:05.000
I have a soft spot in my heart for Final Fantasy IV because it was really the first Final Fantasy

03:05.000 --> 03:09.000
game I was just so sucked into start to finish the entire way.

03:09.000 --> 03:13.000
The game is going to be called Final Fantasy IV The After Return to the Moon.

03:13.000 --> 03:18.000
It is a true sequel to the game which originally came out in 1991.

03:18.000 --> 03:22.000
And then, do you know how this just ruined my day?

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
It's coming out in February on mobile phones.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
That's right.

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
The Final Fantasy IV sequel is a mobile phone game.

03:29.000 --> 03:33.000
It's coming out on NTT Docomo phones.

03:33.000 --> 03:37.000
We don't even have stuff this powerful over here in this country that can run this stuff.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
Yeah, we do.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
They can run these type of games like they have in Japan?

03:41.000 --> 03:47.000
We do, but they're expensive and they don't put anything out on them.

03:47.000 --> 03:51.000
They've got them out over in Europe too.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
It shouldn't be that big of a surprise because we've already heard about Parasite Eve III

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
and a Kingdom Hearts game coming over to mobile phone platforms.

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
But I don't want to play Final Fantasy IV on my mobile phone.

04:00.000 --> 04:04.000
At least give me the freaking DS.

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
I was so angsty when I read this news earlier in the week.

04:07.000 --> 04:12.000
I said, you know what, I know what segment I want to have follow this news story when we read it this week.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
Privacy FUs of the week and Jamie's going to start us off.

04:30.000 --> 04:35.000
My FU of the week goes towards the doctor that I saw who is not my regular doctor.

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
First of all, I'm not an idiot.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
You can tell me what's freaking wrong.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
You can tell me what you suspect to be wrong.

04:44.000 --> 04:48.000
And, you know, I usually can follow what you're saying.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
My doctor is great, okay?

04:50.000 --> 04:56.000
If ever I remotely suspect anything is wrong or have an idea of what might be the cause.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
You know me, I'll research the crap out of everything.

04:59.000 --> 05:03.000
He listens to me and then he actually tests for the stuff that I suggest.

05:03.000 --> 05:09.000
Which is how we found out, you know, found out how to treat chronic fatigue for me.

05:09.000 --> 05:14.000
So that I could actually, you know, not pass out on a daily basis or be hurt or anything.

05:14.000 --> 05:22.000
What happened is when I was in Alabama, and I don't know how I did it, but my right hand ring finger started, the tendon started to catch.

05:22.000 --> 05:28.000
And I wouldn't be able to lift my finger in the morning unless I massaged it and got blood flowing.

05:28.000 --> 05:35.000
And it was really inflamed along the tendon that goes down my palm, so I went to see this doctor.

05:35.000 --> 05:40.000
And my regular doctor, I guess, was out for the holidays or something.

05:40.000 --> 05:46.000
So, you know, he tested it and, you know, I had been icing it and doing all the right stuff.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
But he said, okay, we're going to give you a cortisone shot.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
I was like, what's actually wrong with it?

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
Oh, it's fine, we'll just do the shot.

05:53.000 --> 05:57.000
And so he didn't tell me anything, so I actually, I got a cortisone shot in my hand.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
And he wouldn't let me watch it either.

06:00.000 --> 06:05.000
It pissed me off because I actually, I don't have the fear of needles that I used to, you know.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
I give myself a shot in the leg twice a week.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
I can stand watching a needle in my hand.

06:09.000 --> 06:15.000
So he said he wouldn't do it until I, you know, would not watch him put the needle in.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
I was like, dude, I'm not going to pass out.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
And he's like, are you squeamish?

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
Are you going to pass out?

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
I'm like, no.

06:22.000 --> 06:28.000
And so it took me looking up the symptoms myself and then looking up the treatments

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
to realize that he was treating me for trigger finger.

06:31.000 --> 06:36.000
Which is funny because my grandma actually just had surgery on that one like about a month ago.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
Runs in the family, right?

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
It's not hereditary.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
Trigger finger has to do with inflammation of the tendons

06:43.000 --> 06:47.000
and that it's slipping out of the tendon sheath that goes over the tendons.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
Then it's just irony.

06:49.000 --> 06:53.000
Yeah, it's coincidence.

06:53.000 --> 06:58.000
However, I will go ahead and say that I am having a lot less pain in the hand.

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
It's going to be another few days before the cortisone takes full effect

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
and I start physical therapy next week.

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
So that's, you know, fun, but not.

07:06.000 --> 07:15.000
So F.U. to doctors who do not communicate with their patients.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
I'm going to go back and see my regular doctor.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
Let's move on, Loki, your F.U.

07:19.000 --> 07:22.000
Anyways, my F.U. of the week.

07:22.000 --> 07:28.000
Not a big surprise to EVGA for giving me a card that's set on arrival.

07:28.000 --> 07:33.000
For the other thing also, for the card being a gimp version of the normal card that should have been,

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
or the motherboard being a gimp version of that,

07:36.000 --> 07:40.000
with no possible way for me to know what's going wrong when there is something going wrong.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
So now I just have to kind of guess.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
It'll be the last time I buy a motherboard from them

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
and it'll probably be the last time I buy a motherboard from Newegg as well

07:48.000 --> 07:54.000
because they apparently are pawning off crap that's gimp versions of the real thing.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
So, that sucks.

07:56.000 --> 08:00.000
I'll buy from Fry's, so that way if it sucks and it's not working,

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
I can take it right back the next day or the same day,

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
instead of having to do this whole RMA process.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
Alright, is that it?

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
That's it.

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
My F.U. of the week goes to Mondays.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
I'll keep it short, I hate Mondays as do we all.

08:14.000 --> 08:18.000
You know, Jamie, when you get that controlling time thing figured out,

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
can you figure out a way to do away with Mondays?

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
Maybe we should just give Monday a different name.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
Fun Day!

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
But it would be the same thing.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
No, I don't like that idea.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
Mondays are horrible.

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
Alright, so that's it, that's my F.U. of the week.

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
Now we can get back into some gaming news, can't we?

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
Yes, we can.

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
Well, we have some news.

08:43.000 --> 08:47.000
For our friends who are interested in GameTap,

08:47.000 --> 08:55.000
we will be having Street Fighter III Third Strike as of December 20th.

08:55.000 --> 09:01.000
No online play, but it's Street Fighter III Third Strike.

09:01.000 --> 09:05.000
So, hey, that's good.

09:05.000 --> 09:10.000
And on top of that, if you've got the Capcom joystick,

09:10.000 --> 09:14.000
I think that they actually do have some compatibility with it through GameTap.

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
It's been a long time since I've used that service.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
I was kind of sad about the games leaving,

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
and I guess they did some client upgrade.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
I haven't even checked it out yet.

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
If I'm not playing it enough, I ought to just cancel the darn thing,

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
but there's still a lot about it I like.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
We'll see.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
Moving on with more news.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
Yes.

09:34.000 --> 09:38.000
Anyways, so, I don't know, this isn't really a big surprise for me,

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
but Mass Effect is selling very well.

09:41.000 --> 09:45.000
In fact, they've sold millions.

09:45.000 --> 09:49.000
Over the three weeks since launch,

09:49.000 --> 09:53.000
they have sold over one million units globally,

09:53.000 --> 09:57.000
and that should be pretty good, I guess.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
I don't know. It's a good game.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
I'd like to sell a million copies of anything.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
That would be pretty good for business, I would think.

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
Millions of copies.

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
A lot of people would like certain other games to sell a million copies worldwide.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
Like the Eye of Judgment?

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
Maybe.

10:14.000 --> 10:18.000
Maybe they'll sell millions of movies on the Xbox Live Marketplace pretty soon,

10:18.000 --> 10:22.000
because now it has expanded, finally, after all this time.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
It's not just the North America-U.S.

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
It's just the U.S. really had the video marketplace before.

10:28.000 --> 10:32.000
Now it's expanding to other parts of North America, including Canada,

10:32.000 --> 10:38.000
and then overseas as well, the U.K., Ireland, France, and Germany

10:38.000 --> 10:43.000
are all getting the Xbox Live Marketplace finally in their territories.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
We would tell you more about what's on it,

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
but how many of you guys don't have Netflix accounts

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
or some other way of getting your movies?

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
No, I guess the Xbox Live Marketplace is pretty cool

10:52.000 --> 10:57.000
for looking at high-def stuff on demand.

10:57.000 --> 11:03.000
The Microsoft Points breakdown structure is very similar to what they have here in the U.S.,

11:03.000 --> 11:07.000
but just translated for the other countries

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
when it comes to how much they pay for the Microsoft Points.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
Well, there you have it.

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
Of course, some people might just kind of think,

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
why should I even bother with the video marketplace at all

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
now that the Xbox 360 has DIVX?

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
That's a very good question.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
DIVX is special.

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
It's the right thing. You want to do the legal thing, right?

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
Right?

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
All right, more news.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
All right, well, hey, guess what?

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
Assassin's Creed has sold a bunch.

11:37.000 --> 11:42.000
They have sold 2.5 million copies globally,

11:42.000 --> 11:46.000
and they've sold a whole bunch more than they thought it would.

11:46.000 --> 11:51.000
They are hoping to reach 5 million by March 08.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
And I still have yet to play the damn game.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
I think I have it.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
You can probably borrow mine.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
Really?

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
Yeah.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
I kind of want to play it before our year-end show,

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
because I hear a lot of people saying it's a great game

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
and deserves to be on year-end's best list.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
So it won't make mine, though,

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
if I don't ever get a chance to play it.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
So I may take you up on that, Jamie.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
Did you play Assassin's Creed, Loki?

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
You talked about it.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
Briefly.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
You didn't like it, right?

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
No.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
What was your problem with it?

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
I don't know.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
I just didn't like how intricate it was.

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
The control scheme for it, I didn't care for.

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
I just really didn't get to play it much.

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
The thing was, it didn't really hook me, I guess.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
I played it for a few minutes.

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
I was like, eh, I don't really want to give this any more time.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
All right.

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
So I didn't.

12:40.000 --> 12:45.000
Anyways, there's some interesting news coming out

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
from the company Gearbox.

12:47.000 --> 12:53.000
And, of course, they have done stuff

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
like the brand new Brothers in Arms series.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
Hell's Highway, actually, one of the titles

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
that keeps getting pushed back.

13:01.000 --> 13:07.000
So one thing that they're looking for for some inspiration

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
is actually the game Portal.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
Because most of their games, I think, in the past

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
have been pretty linear.

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
They like the way that Portal, the whole story layout

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
and stuff like that.

13:16.000 --> 13:21.000
Hopefully, in the future, we'll see some more futuristic games

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
from Gearbox.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
So that's pretty cool.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
Now, you're a big fan of Portal, Jamie.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
Yes, I am.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
And do you believe that more games should

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
take inspiration from Portal?

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
I think so.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
I mean, because, honestly, what they're doing

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
is taking, I actually have to say,

13:38.000 --> 13:41.000
because also listening to some of the commentary in the game,

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
I think it was pretty cool that they were taking

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
different concepts in physics and trying

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
to incorporate them into the gameplay in a completely

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
different way.

13:49.000 --> 13:52.000
Changing, instead of having puzzle here,

13:52.000 --> 14:00.000
you don't necessarily think in height and width and depth.

14:00.000 --> 14:03.000
You think in terms of manipulating that space

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
to your own ends.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
And I think that that's pretty cool.

14:06.000 --> 14:09.000
And it completely offers a completely different range

14:09.000 --> 14:13.000
of freedom, I think, as far as how they can design a game.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
Very cool.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
I'm going to have to listen to that commentary stuff

14:16.000 --> 14:16.000
sometime.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
I think more games should have commentary tracks on it.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
I think that's a pretty interesting idea.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
Well, it's hard to have a commentary track in the game.

14:22.000 --> 14:25.000
I like the way that Portal kind of did it,

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
where you just kind of go up to something

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
and then kind of play the game from there.

14:29.000 --> 14:32.000
It had like a little chat box over it

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
that you could highlight with your gun.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
And then it would play.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
And it actually gave you a meter bar

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
so you see how far through the commentary you were

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
and you could pause it.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
Huh.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.000
That's pretty cool.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
Well, of course, there are a lot of fans of Portal.

14:45.000 --> 14:50.000
And I'm sure this is something that Jamie would want to get.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
It's a plush companion cube.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
That's right.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
There is officially.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
Now, you may have seen this, that there

14:56.000 --> 15:00.000
was a lot of fan-made weighted companion cubes being made

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
and there was a lot of fan stuff.

15:02.000 --> 15:05.000
Well, Valve actually decided to put their own version out

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
because I'm sure they're seeing what other people are doing

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
and they're like, hey, we need to get a piece of that.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
So they put out official weighted companion cube

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
plushies.

15:12.000 --> 15:15.000
And in less than 24 hours, the damn thing sold out.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
That's how popular these things are.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
I'm actually seeing if they still have the fuzzy dice.

15:19.000 --> 15:22.000
They went on sale at 4 o'clock on Friday

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
and sold out by noon on Saturday.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
That's crazy.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
I guess they'll have to make more.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
I just want the fuzzy dice.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
These could be more popular than the Wii.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
I just want the fuzzy dice.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
You just want the fuzzy dice?

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
Are you actually going to hang them in your car?

15:34.000 --> 15:37.000
Yes, I will because my Pac-Man dice are highly faded now.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
Oh, that's too bad.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
Well, then your weighted companion cubes will fade.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
They'll burn up just like they do in the game.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
Spoiler.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.000
Oh, my bad.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
You know what?

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
Dan was really funny about that part.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
How so?

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
I think it's what I'd mentioned to you earlier.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
Dan's like, yeah, it's very obvious that the character

15:51.000 --> 15:54.000
you're playing is female because they expect you to get

15:54.000 --> 15:58.000
all sappy and all sobby over your weighted companion

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
cube being dead.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
It's a cube.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
I was like, you don't get it.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
You can also tell your main character's a woman

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
because in the very beginning of the game,

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
there's like a mirror.

16:07.000 --> 16:10.000
And you see that your character has boobs, OMG boobs.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
Well, he was joking.

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
If you look at her face, though, that could very well be a man.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
It's pretty ugly.

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
He's actually modeled after some person.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
She's a man, baby.

16:21.000 --> 16:25.000
He was cracking up, though, over the part where you get out

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
after the 19th.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.000
What is up with Chat?

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
Chat is on their like crazy kick where they're just now naming

16:30.000 --> 16:33.000
all of these games, putting Portal in place of the titles

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
of the games.

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
Portal of Honor, Need for Portal, Portal of Duty,

16:37.000 --> 16:41.000
Portal Combat, Super Smash Portal, Portal, Portal Paradise,

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
The King of Portal 11.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
What the hell is wrong with you people?

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
It's the cocaine.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
There's a lot of cocaine.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
Have we been giving out cocaine in Chat?

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
Share, please.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
No kidding.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
All right.

16:56.000 --> 17:00.000
Well, moving on to other gaming news then.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
I don't want to.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
You have to.

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
OK.

17:05.000 --> 17:11.000
Lost Odyssey is supposed to, it's actually going to be out

17:11.000 --> 17:15.000
on Xbox 360 as an exclusive RPG.

17:15.000 --> 17:18.000
And it has a release date of February 12th.

17:18.000 --> 17:22.000
And downloadable content will be on its way.

17:22.000 --> 17:26.000
Aren't I supposed to be able to get download content for free

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
if I pre-order or something?

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
I thought I read something about that.

17:29.000 --> 17:32.000
It's actually saying that downloadable content will be

17:32.000 --> 17:35.000
made exclusive to anyone who pre-orders.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
Oh.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
Oh, so I don't get free download content.

17:38.000 --> 17:42.000
I just get to, I get to pay more to have the download content

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
if I pre-order.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.000
Oh, OK.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
That would make more sense.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
I would hope so.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
Because they can use the codes and stuff, right?

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
Yeah.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
They'll give you codes.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
That's what I would think.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
All right.

17:52.000 --> 17:55.000
I don't know if you've heard much about this game yet.

17:55.000 --> 17:59.000
Well, I didn't get very highly, or reviews weren't that great

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
on it in Japan.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
The trailer looked really good.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
It did.

18:04.000 --> 18:07.000
But then I heard it's not doing, like it did not get very well

18:07.000 --> 18:08.000
received over in Japan.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
So that makes me a little less excited about it.

18:10.000 --> 18:13.000
What's interesting though, which people might not know,

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
is it's on four DVDs.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
Just like Blue Dragon was on three.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
Wow.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
Go DVDs.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
Yay.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
Can't fit all that space on there.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
So sad.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
This game must be epic.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
It's very epic.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
You know what, actually, sadly enough,

18:28.000 --> 18:32.000
know what the game looked like, and that's not really a good point for it.

18:32.000 --> 18:37.000
Kind of reminds me a little bit of, oh god, what is that game now?

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
I just had the name.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
I don't know, you bought it.

18:41.000 --> 18:44.000
It's like, not Phantasy Star.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
99 Nights?

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
Not 99 Nights.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
Enchanted Arms.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
Oh, OK.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
Yeah, that's not a good thing to be compared to.

18:51.000 --> 18:54.000
Enchanted Arms wasn't horrible, it just wasn't great.

18:54.000 --> 18:57.000
I don't know.

18:57.000 --> 19:05.000
Anyways, so, the Mega Man 20th anniversary countdown apparently ends tonight.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
And what exactly does that mean?

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
Well, who knows?

19:09.000 --> 19:13.000
But there's going to be a big announcement, of course, coming soon.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
Probably, I'd imagine, a new game.

19:15.000 --> 19:21.000
Hopefully not another, like, oh surprise, it's a remake or another collection.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
Mega Man Battle Network again.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
Yay.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
Yay.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
How about Mega Man Legends 3?

19:27.000 --> 19:30.000
Haven't you guys been hankering for some of that for a while?

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
Fuck yeah.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
Of course, they're never going to give that to us.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
Never say never.

19:35.000 --> 19:41.000
Some theories might be that Mega Man's going to be announced as an official character in Super Smash Bros. Brawl,

19:41.000 --> 19:46.000
which I would think that would be covered on the daily updates on their stupid website.

19:46.000 --> 19:49.000
I think they would have done it already, if that was true.

19:49.000 --> 19:59.000
I was seeing right now, if there's any sort of update here, other than, well, right now it just says,

19:59.000 --> 20:03.000
I guess, four hours and four minutes?

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
I can't read Japanese, dammit.

20:05.000 --> 20:11.000
But there's 0404, so either I got the wrong page,

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
which is entirely possible.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
Happy birthday, Rockman.

20:15.000 --> 20:18.000
Still looking like a chick.

20:18.000 --> 20:25.000
RawstealUT says in response to the whole Mega Man Legends 3,

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
SkyCapcom can't do that.

20:27.000 --> 20:30.000
That'd make Mega Man relevant again.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
I guess that's true.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
Jamie made a face at that comment.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
What was that face about?

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
You made a face.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
It was just a face.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
Oh, I see.

20:37.000 --> 20:40.000
It was an angry face, or it was a ger face.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
It was a face.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
I see.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
All right.

20:44.000 --> 20:48.000
Well, now I know this news ought to make Jamie happy.

20:48.000 --> 20:51.000
This is something that will make Jamie very happy for Christmas.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
But I don't know, maybe not.

20:52.000 --> 20:57.000
Christmas Nights, you know, Jamie always talks about her annual tradition

20:57.000 --> 21:00.000
of putting the Saturn back up and playing some Christmas Nights every year.

21:00.000 --> 21:04.000
Well, maybe she won't have to anymore because it is going to be included

21:04.000 --> 21:09.000
in the PlayStation 2 remake of Nights into Dreams for the PlayStation 2.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
It's going to have Christmas Nights as well.

21:11.000 --> 21:14.000
The bad news for Jamie, it's a Japan-only release,

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
so she's going to have to pay more money to import it.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
Like, that's a bad thing at all.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
I've got a Japanese PlayStation 2.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
I do have to admit, remember they said they weren't really remaking the game?

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
Uh-huh.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
The graphics do look a little bit sharper.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
Well, they probably went back and undressed some things

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
and cleaned some things up.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
To also make another point,

21:29.000 --> 21:34.000
the Saturn did not have nearly the 3D capability that the PlayStation did.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
And so being on the PlayStation 2,

21:36.000 --> 21:40.000
one would think that it has a better 3D processor than the Saturn would.

21:40.000 --> 21:43.000
So it would have to be cleaner textures and that type of thing.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
Yeah, but true.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
But then you also forget the fact that people like to slack off

21:46.000 --> 21:49.000
when they port games over and they'll just port them exactly the same

21:49.000 --> 21:52.000
for authentic purposes, you know?

21:52.000 --> 21:55.000
I think even so, even if it was ported over just the same,

21:55.000 --> 22:00.000
it still has better, it'd be better capable of processing it.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
Now, Jamie, it's not going to be as simple, unfortunately,

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
as paying all the money to import the game

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
because not only are you going to have to do that,

22:06.000 --> 22:10.000
but then you have to beat Nights into Dreams

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
and then you will unlock Christmas Dreams.

22:12.000 --> 22:15.000
Tell me how that's hard.

22:15.000 --> 22:18.000
I'm just saying, you've got to put a little bit of work into it.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
You might have to lift a finger, Jamie, to get your Christmas Dreams.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
You know the hardest thing about that is going to be playing

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
without getting motion sick

22:24.000 --> 22:28.000
because Nights is another one of those games that makes me motion sick.

22:28.000 --> 22:34.000
I got really sick playing Portal earlier.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
Okay, Portal, right cake attorney.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
Okay, no more Portal jokes.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
Jesus, they are still going.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
That's great.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
Shut up.

22:44.000 --> 22:47.000
Portal, right cake attorney.

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
I'm leaving chat so I don't have to read any more of that.

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
Lordy.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
Chat room, you're banned from commenting on our program for a little bit

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
so you can calm down with the Portal stuff.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
Portal combat.

22:57.000 --> 23:00.000
If they could behave.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
All right, we'll see if they can behave during our next segment,

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
the weekly mailbag segment.

23:04.000 --> 23:07.000
Every week you send in your e-mails to mailbag at orangelaundry.com

23:07.000 --> 23:11.000
and we pick a few of our favorites to read right here on the air.

23:11.000 --> 23:14.000
And Jamie will read them and we'll compliment you or we'll make fun of you

23:14.000 --> 23:17.000
or we'll answer your question or we'll sing a song and dance.

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
Who knows, it's unpredictable.

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
It's the mailbag segment.

23:21.000 --> 23:25.000
Jamie, open up ye old mailbag and tell us what's in it this week.

23:25.000 --> 23:29.000
I will be doing neither song nor dance, just to make a point of order.

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
But if you'd like to, you can dance to the song playing in the background.

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
Those of you playing along at home.

23:33.000 --> 23:34.000
No, you can't.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
I'll pop my head.

23:36.000 --> 23:39.000
First e-mail.

23:39.000 --> 23:43.000
From Riz, I guess is how it's pronounced.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
Hi Rob, Jamie, and Matt.

23:45.000 --> 23:49.000
This e-mail was constructed for a number of reasons which are detailed below.

23:49.000 --> 23:52.000
I would first like to say what a pleasure listening to your podcast has been.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
Oh, thank you.

23:54.000 --> 23:57.000
I have enjoyed OOR since around March and have been greatly entertained

23:57.000 --> 24:01.000
by their mix of news, banter, and general chaos.

24:01.000 --> 24:04.000
I have been visually impaired since birth

24:04.000 --> 24:07.000
but was able to play a number of video games when I was younger.

24:07.000 --> 24:10.000
Due to a deterioration in my eyesight over the years,

24:10.000 --> 24:13.000
the number of games I can play is now greatly reduced.

24:13.000 --> 24:16.000
I still like to follow the rather hectic and frantic world of video games

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
and your podcast is perfect for that.

24:18.000 --> 24:22.000
I have a question regarding music and podcasts which I would greatly appreciate an answer.

24:22.000 --> 24:25.000
I've just started my own podcast and would like to know

24:25.000 --> 24:28.000
am I able to use video game music for intros and outros?

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
Obviously, the podcast is free.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
I apologize if this e-mail has gone too long.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
Keep up the good work.

24:34.000 --> 24:38.000
I find that most companies and stuff generally don't care

24:38.000 --> 24:41.000
if you use video game music and stuff.

24:41.000 --> 24:44.000
It's promotion for them.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
What do they care?

24:46.000 --> 24:49.000
I believe there's some type of fair use law out there or something

24:49.000 --> 24:52.000
that as long as you limit it to 30 seconds, you're fine.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
Nobody can really sue you over it.

24:54.000 --> 24:57.000
Sure, the polite thing to do is ask and all that stuff,

24:57.000 --> 25:00.000
but I think as long as you use it, especially the old stuff,

25:00.000 --> 25:03.000
the old 8-Bit stuff which I know a lot of podcasts use for their openings and things,

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
nobody's really going to care.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
I think it's fine.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
Next e-mail.

25:08.000 --> 25:11.000
I would like to thank Sky Dark Sakura and Loki

25:11.000 --> 25:14.000
for hosting the best gaming podcast on the internet.

25:14.000 --> 25:17.000
I just started listening a couple of weeks ago and already I'm hooked.

25:17.000 --> 25:20.000
I've already been scouring the internet for all the episodes I can download.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
I listen to them on my PSP.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
More PSP listeners?

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
I said in part A. There were some. They do exist.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
There's no better place for gaming news and humor.

25:28.000 --> 25:29.000
One quick question though.

25:29.000 --> 25:32.000
Is there anywhere I can download previous episodes?

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
The RSS feed only goes back a few episodes

25:34.000 --> 25:37.000
and there's about 250 more I can't find.

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
Thanks and screw Rock Band for sucking so much online.

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
pkgr92

25:41.000 --> 25:44.000
If you go to OLRPSP.com,

25:44.000 --> 25:47.000
the parser over there actually goes back a few more episodes,

25:47.000 --> 25:50.000
which if you're listening on your PSP, you've probably already done.

25:50.000 --> 25:53.000
You can go back about 20 episodes there.

25:53.000 --> 25:58.000
Otherwise, we keep, I think, some of the websites like

25:58.000 --> 26:03.000
Yahoo Podcasts, I want to say.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.000
What about iTunes?

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
Podcast Alley.

26:06.000 --> 26:11.000
The one on iTunes only goes back 10 listings, which is about five episodes.

26:11.000 --> 26:16.000
The reason for that is to prevent what happened a few years ago to some podcasts

26:16.000 --> 26:20.000
is that this new application came out for the Xbox 360 called XB Stream.

26:20.000 --> 26:23.000
It's a great idea and a great application.

26:23.000 --> 26:26.000
We're actually a default podcast that's on it when you put this thing in.

26:26.000 --> 26:29.000
But for the default podcast that we're on, the very first version of it,

26:29.000 --> 26:34.000
what happened is that the program downloaded every single program from the feed,

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
which for people that never cleaned up their feeds,

26:36.000 --> 26:40.000
meant their server was getting hammered for like 100 downloads of big shows at once.

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
So we keep our feed tidy for that reason,

26:42.000 --> 26:45.000
so that if you use a grabber that does something like that

26:45.000 --> 26:48.000
where it gets all episodes of a show, you're limited to 10.

26:48.000 --> 26:49.000
That's pretty much the reason we do it.

26:49.000 --> 26:52.000
We only do server cleans about once every few months when we need the space.

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
Otherwise, if you want to find shows older than that,

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
ask around the community, post on the forums.

26:56.000 --> 27:02.000
I know there's one person out there that probably has every pre-podcast show we ever did.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
I know there's at least one person out there that has that.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
I don't even have that to put it in perspective.

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
I've asked and haven't heard anything.

27:08.000 --> 27:11.000
I have a lot, and we might put out some DVDs out there,

27:11.000 --> 27:15.000
but we can't do any big releases of it just because of some of the things.

27:15.000 --> 27:18.000
We might have to do something kind of like under the table for the fans only

27:18.000 --> 27:21.000
because there was some copyright music, so we can't really sell it for profit.

27:21.000 --> 27:25.000
But anything's a possibility in the near future, so we'll see.

27:25.000 --> 27:28.000
There's also a funny quote on here from Loki.

27:28.000 --> 27:29.000
Sure.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.000
Friendship is like peeing on yourself.

27:30.000 --> 27:34.000
Everyone can see it, but only you get the warm feeling it brings.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
Wow.

27:36.000 --> 27:39.000
Yeah.

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
To Sky.

27:41.000 --> 27:44.000
I was wondering why every time G4 is brought up on the show,

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
you moan and groan about how much you hate it.

27:46.000 --> 27:50.000
I hate G4.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
It isn't that bad in my opinion.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
The shows such as Attack of the Show being my favorite,

27:54.000 --> 27:57.000
X-Play, Cheat, and Ninja Warrior are all awesome.

27:57.000 --> 28:00.000
I can understand that a lot of people wish that it were more like it used to be

28:00.000 --> 28:05.000
when it was tech TV, but had a more gaming-oriented atmosphere to it.

28:05.000 --> 28:10.000
Hell, I'm pissed that they took off icons and replaced it with crap like cheaters and cops.

28:10.000 --> 28:11.000
But you shouldn't hate G4 completely.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
It still has some great shows on it.

28:13.000 --> 28:14.000
Thanks, Oscar.

28:14.000 --> 28:17.000
PS, have you guys seen the zero punctuation gaming reviews?

28:17.000 --> 28:18.000
Here's a link to the site.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
Oh, I have to see this.

28:20.000 --> 28:21.000
That's some funny shit.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
Yeah, I watch it every week.

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
See, that's the kind of shit that G4 needs on television,

28:25.000 --> 28:28.000
not the crap they have now that feels so, you know,

28:28.000 --> 28:31.000
where the game reviews are written by interns and all this stuff.

28:31.000 --> 28:38.000
X-Play is turned into a speck of what it used to be back when it was on tech TV.

28:38.000 --> 28:42.000
It's just you pretty much named all the reasons right there in your e-mail.

28:42.000 --> 28:46.000
It's nothing like it could have been with the whole tech TV merge and stuff,

28:46.000 --> 28:50.000
and it just got too corporate and yucky, and it's owned by E, for God's sakes.

28:50.000 --> 28:51.000
I mean, I don't know.

28:51.000 --> 28:55.000
It's just everything that's kind of disturbing about corporate media

28:55.000 --> 29:00.000
is kind of like embodied in G4, and that's why I just don't like it.

29:00.000 --> 29:05.000
And I'm allowed not to like things.

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
Next e-mail.

29:07.000 --> 29:08.000
Hi, guys.

29:08.000 --> 29:09.000
Yes.

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
I know you don't normally read FUs from listeners,

29:11.000 --> 29:14.000
but I was in a car accident yesterday, and I really wanted to vent somewhere.

29:14.000 --> 29:15.000
Why not?

29:15.000 --> 29:19.000
To the woman in the Jeep who tried to pass me by going onto the oncoming traffic

29:19.000 --> 29:22.000
while I was making a U-turn at Big Fat FU.

29:22.000 --> 29:27.000
This is on my last day of finals, and I was just about to go home from Davis,

29:27.000 --> 29:28.000
and I am pissed off.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
I'm going to have to agree with Loki.

29:30.000 --> 29:31.000
The woman driver is in the sack area.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
I can't drive for anything, except me.

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
That would be me.

29:35.000 --> 29:36.000
Unfortunately, everyone is okay.

29:36.000 --> 29:39.000
Although, my head slams into the car door during the impact.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
The only part of this is that since I won't have a car for a while,

29:41.000 --> 29:44.000
I'll be able to sit at home and play all the games I want over the break.

29:44.000 --> 29:48.000
That being the case, what are your favorite games that came out this holiday season

29:48.000 --> 29:52.000
on any console since I guess I'll be looking for something to pass the time?

29:52.000 --> 29:53.000
Keep up the awesome show.

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
I need something to keep my spirits up.

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
What an awesome way to start the holidays.

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
Happy holidays, AZHP.

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
Portal.

30:01.000 --> 30:04.000
I don't want to give it all away, because then I'd be basically giving you

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
my favorite games of the year.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
But I will back up what Jamie said.

30:08.000 --> 30:12.000
I think Orange Box in general is a very good investment.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
Here's a thought, though.

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
Use this period, this opportunity.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
I'm glad you have such a positive attitude about it,

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
because that really sucks what happened.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
I'm glad you have a good attitude about it.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
Instead of necessarily having to play everything new that comes out,

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
go back and play the shit you missed,

30:26.000 --> 30:29.000
because I bet there's a lot of stuff that you missed towards the end of last year,

30:29.000 --> 30:30.000
but amongst all the console madness.

30:30.000 --> 30:31.000
It'll give you a great example for me.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
Final Fantasy XII.

30:33.000 --> 30:36.000
I did not get nearly as far in that game as I would have liked to,

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
because it was an amazing battle system in the game,

30:38.000 --> 30:41.000
and I just never really got a chance to just play it the whole way through to completion.

30:41.000 --> 30:44.000
That's one of those games I would like to complete one day when there's time.

30:44.000 --> 30:48.000
So I would encourage you to actually take this opportunity to go revisit the past games

30:48.000 --> 30:51.000
and beat stuff you haven't yet that you wanted to.

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
You can go to Deliverance Online and download Ragnarok Online

30:53.000 --> 30:56.000
and play on the server with me and Ranma,

30:56.000 --> 30:59.000
and join the OLR Guild on there.

30:59.000 --> 31:00.000
Yeah, there you go.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.000
Join an MMO.

31:01.000 --> 31:02.000
That'll suck up all your time.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
There you have it.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
AZHP is actually in chat right now and says,

31:06.000 --> 31:09.000
I just finished XII during finals week.

31:09.000 --> 31:10.000
LOL.

31:10.000 --> 31:13.000
How did you have time to beat a Final Fantasy game during finals?

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
Are you taking home ec?

31:15.000 --> 31:16.000
What is up with that?

31:16.000 --> 31:17.000
Wow, that's amazing.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.000
Hey, Rob.

31:18.000 --> 31:19.000
What, what?

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
I actually, one of my finals weeks,

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
I stayed up for three days and played D&D every night.

31:23.000 --> 31:24.000
Oh, my God.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.000
You guys are crazy.

31:25.000 --> 31:26.000
I passed out on the fourth day.

31:26.000 --> 31:29.000
I was kept alive by Jolt Cola and Pixie Sticks.

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
Loki, any recommendations for our listener

31:31.000 --> 31:34.000
who's handicapped for Winter Break

31:34.000 --> 31:37.000
for games to play while they're on Winter Break?

31:37.000 --> 31:42.000
Well, Call of Duty 4 is pretty good, I guess.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.000
Yeah, actually it is.

31:43.000 --> 31:46.000
Halo 3.

31:46.000 --> 31:50.000
Super Mario Galaxy.

31:50.000 --> 31:51.000
I don't know.

31:51.000 --> 31:52.000
You can play a ton of stuff.

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
There's tons of games out there.

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
Just play something you haven't played yet.

31:56.000 --> 31:57.000
There you go.

31:57.000 --> 31:58.000
RPGs.

31:58.000 --> 31:59.000
There you go.

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
We'll bring you a Nintendo.

32:01.000 --> 32:02.000
And you can play classic stuff.

32:02.000 --> 32:03.000
You can play Guardian Legend.

32:03.000 --> 32:04.000
That's right.

32:04.000 --> 32:07.000
Go back and play every Saturn game you didn't play previously.

32:07.000 --> 32:10.000
Dear God, I don't have enough room for that.

32:10.000 --> 32:11.000
All right, anyhow.

32:11.000 --> 32:12.000
I know what you should do.

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
Find me a copy of Burning Rangers.

32:14.000 --> 32:17.000
Next email, please.

32:17.000 --> 32:20.000
First of all, Merry early Christmas slash Happy Holidays.

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
I'm not sure if you're doing an episode for the 23rd,

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
and I don't think I can listen live on the 16th,

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
which, as of this writing, is today,

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
since I have a final exam the next day.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
Oops, good luck on that.

32:30.000 --> 32:33.000
This is from GS68, by the way.

32:33.000 --> 32:34.000
Who happens to be in chat, by the way,

32:34.000 --> 32:35.000
so I guess he found a way.

32:35.000 --> 32:36.000
Yeah.

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
Second, there's one particular issue

32:38.000 --> 32:41.000
that concerns me regarding fellow gamers.

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
On sites like Game Politics, Facebook,

32:43.000 --> 32:44.000
and especially GameSpot,

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
there are gamers who are quick to get angry

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
and defensive about their games whenever Dr. Phil,

32:48.000 --> 32:51.000
whose comment on the game usage, not games,

32:51.000 --> 32:54.000
being a problem was, in my opinion,

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
a step in the right direction,

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
although many people who commented on the story

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
just saw the name Dr. Phil and immediately thought,

33:00.000 --> 33:03.000
oh my God, it's Dr. Phil, he sucks yours.

33:03.000 --> 33:07.000
JT censorship and school shootings show up.

33:07.000 --> 33:08.000
In fact, I see comments along the lines of,

33:08.000 --> 33:11.000
I hope JT gets his ass kicked so hard he goes sterile,

33:11.000 --> 33:15.000
and worse, maybe Microsoft will hire a drifter and kill him.

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
It's rather ironic that there are gamers

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
who oppose the idea that video games

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
make people violent-minded

33:21.000 --> 33:24.000
and then go on wishing death upon Jackie Pooh.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
I dislike JT as much as the next gamer,

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
especially his reaction to gamers' email.

33:28.000 --> 33:31.000
The Flowers for Jack project and its outcome are a prime example.

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
But what he, as gamers, need to realize

33:33.000 --> 33:36.000
is that by personally attacking him back unprofessionally

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
and wishing physical injury or death upon him,

33:38.000 --> 33:41.000
we are reinforcing his belief that violent video games

33:41.000 --> 33:44.000
are bad for the mind and stooping to his level

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
of ad hominem attacks,

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
which is a whole different topic,

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
and I'll probably get into future emails,

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
Skype call, whatever.

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
Those kinds of personal attacks make us gamers

33:54.000 --> 33:57.000
look bad in front of people supportive of video game censorship,

33:57.000 --> 34:00.000
and if we need to get Sensible Worth Academy,

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
no, as if we need to get Sensible Worth Academy,

34:02.000 --> 34:07.000
is this kind of defensiveness and immaturity

34:07.000 --> 34:11.000
that also led to the creation of the otaku stereotype.

34:11.000 --> 34:14.000
And I'm a gamer and an anime slash manga fan,

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
so facepalm.

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
And with all of that said,

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
I wish the three of you and any guests also in the studio

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
a great holiday. Don't die in a car fire.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
Yours truly, GS68.

34:24.000 --> 34:25.000
We'll try, thanks.

34:25.000 --> 34:28.000
PS, are you three going to SAC Anime this January?

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
I'm hoping to go, and it would be great to see you guys there

34:30.000 --> 34:33.000
since I didn't get a chance to go to last summer SAC Anime.

34:33.000 --> 34:36.000
Oh, God, I didn't realize there was one in January, too.

34:36.000 --> 34:37.000
I forgot about it.

34:37.000 --> 34:38.000
We should try to do a panel.

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
I gotta get in touch with Jonas about that.

34:40.000 --> 34:41.000
We'll try and go.

34:41.000 --> 34:42.000
Not at 8 in the morning.

34:42.000 --> 34:43.000
Nah, as long as we get a...

34:43.000 --> 34:44.000
Not at 8 in the morning.

34:44.000 --> 34:45.000
We're not going again if our panel's at 8 in the morning,

34:45.000 --> 34:46.000
but if we can get something better, we'll go.

34:46.000 --> 34:49.000
I probably won't cosplay unless it's my, um,

34:49.000 --> 34:52.000
Organization 13 costume, so.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
Uh, last email.

34:54.000 --> 34:55.000
Dun dun dun.

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
From Cheeseburger.

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
Who signed it with a question mark?

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
I can ask Cheeseburger?

35:01.000 --> 35:02.000
This is Cheeseburger.

35:02.000 --> 35:06.000
Hey, OLR crew, I have been listening to your podcast

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
for almost a year and a half now, and I think it's great.

35:08.000 --> 35:09.000
You're still with us? Cool.

35:09.000 --> 35:10.000
That's cool.

35:10.000 --> 35:13.000
I have also listened live and interacted in chat a few times, too.

35:13.000 --> 35:16.000
The reason for this email is to ask Rob about Civilization 3,

35:16.000 --> 35:20.000
which I purchased for my new computer on his recommendation.

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
What's your perspective on that game?

35:22.000 --> 35:26.000
And I also chose Russia because I thought I could make nuclear weapons

35:26.000 --> 35:27.000
and blow everything up.

35:27.000 --> 35:31.000
The only other PC games I have are StarCraft and Black & White 2.

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
By the way, Loki's comment about having a washer and dryer

35:33.000 --> 35:36.000
so he could now piss himself with joy was hilarious.

35:36.000 --> 35:39.000
Another email comment, Olive Garden Home of the Never Ending Salads

35:39.000 --> 35:40.000
was funny, too.

35:40.000 --> 35:44.000
P.S. I think Rob is rad and Kmart sucks, LOLs.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
I think Cheeseburgers are rad.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
I like Cheeseburgers in Paradise.

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
As long as there's no mayonnaise on them, because mayonnaise is disgusting.

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
I like Cheeseburgers in Paradise.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
What was the question? Civ 3, what is my perspective on Civ 3?

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
You don't have to be the Russians to build nuclear weapons.

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
Anybody builds nuclear weapons.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
Hell, in the old school Civilization game,

36:00.000 --> 36:04.000
I used to play as the Zulus or whatever, because they were green.

36:04.000 --> 36:05.000
I liked green.

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
I used to play as them, and I would make nuclear weapons

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
and nuke the shit out of the Americans.

36:09.000 --> 36:12.000
I always like to win by global domination.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
Of course, there are multiple ways to win the game.

36:14.000 --> 36:17.000
I think you get the most points for being the first person in space,

36:17.000 --> 36:20.000
but that's not nearly as fun as global domination.

36:20.000 --> 36:25.000
My favorite thing to do in Civilization is I like to treat everybody really nice.

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
I'm like, oh, sure, we'll trade with you.

36:27.000 --> 36:30.000
Let's sign a peace treaty. Oh, we love you.

36:30.000 --> 36:34.000
Then I will take a bunch of army units right outside their city,

36:34.000 --> 36:37.000
and then I'll nuke the shit out of them.

36:37.000 --> 36:41.000
We actually got one last email that we got last minute.

36:41.000 --> 36:42.000
I'm going to read it.

36:42.000 --> 36:48.000
It's not signed, so I'm just going to say it's from G. Davis, I guess.

36:48.000 --> 36:49.000
Okay.

36:49.000 --> 36:53.000
LLOLR, after listening to your guys' and Jamie's thoughts on DDR on last week's show,

36:53.000 --> 36:57.000
I cannot help but feel like I need to say I completely agree.

36:57.000 --> 37:00.000
DDR hasn't changed drastically since Sixth Mix.

37:00.000 --> 37:03.000
However, Seventh Mix is my favorite mix and will always be smile face.

37:03.000 --> 37:11.000
The thing that made DDR so much fun to play was the cheesy dance mania pop that was in it.

37:11.000 --> 37:16.000
After seeing the list of licensed songs in the arcade version of Supernova 2,

37:16.000 --> 37:20.000
I have to say that I am not excited for it because a lot of it is shitty mainstream music.

37:20.000 --> 37:23.000
Linkin Park and DDR equals WTF.

37:23.000 --> 37:26.000
The same goes for the home versions.

37:26.000 --> 37:31.000
Most casual gamers I know think Guitar Hero is the best rhythm game because it has real songs in it,

37:31.000 --> 37:36.000
and when they heard that the home version of Supernova 2 had Britney Spears, Gwen Stefani, and Justin Timberlake,

37:36.000 --> 37:39.000
they said Guitar Hero had good real music.

37:39.000 --> 37:44.000
However, they also said that Captain Jack Harchin here is most of the other dance mania tracks for some of their favorite songs in DDR.

37:44.000 --> 37:49.000
I don't think this crappy mainstream pop is appealing to anyone except for 12-year-old girls.

37:49.000 --> 37:54.000
Also, Rob, what innovations would you put in DDR because I've always been curious as to what they are.

37:54.000 --> 37:59.000
One of my favorite things about DDR is the sheer simplicity of it so anybody could jump in and play.

37:59.000 --> 38:03.000
I think too many changes might ruin that part of DDR.

38:03.000 --> 38:07.000
Well, I've said this a million times on the show, but I know you might be a newer listener or what have you.

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
We've been doing the show a long time, so it feels like a million,

38:09.000 --> 38:13.000
but I think the best way they could innovate DDR is that right now the way DDR is,

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
it has a lot of cooperative modes in the game.

38:15.000 --> 38:18.000
There's a lot of cooperative dancing, a lot of cooperative.

38:18.000 --> 38:21.000
I think the way for DDR to innovate is to make it more of a competitive game,

38:21.000 --> 38:24.000
and that way tournaments can be based more around the competition element.

38:24.000 --> 38:27.000
Now, yes, I understand there's Dance Magic in DDR Disney,

38:27.000 --> 38:32.000
and I believe there was a mode similar to it in some of the later home versions that they did for DDR.

38:32.000 --> 38:38.000
However, these versions have always been add-ons or tack-ons and not the focus of the game itself.

38:38.000 --> 38:45.000
I think there ought to be some type of dance battle or something that the game could focus on,

38:45.000 --> 38:48.000
to take in some ideas and innovating from that.

38:48.000 --> 38:52.000
Maybe even in one-player mode you do battle against the computer.

38:52.000 --> 38:57.000
Some of the games like Bust-A-Groove worked is that you were always battling somebody else

38:57.000 --> 38:58.000
to see who was the better dancer.

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
And they did it better in the second one.

39:00.000 --> 39:04.000
Yeah, and I think that could be a new direction for DDR where they could innovate,

39:04.000 --> 39:08.000
yet keep the core element of the game stomping on arrows the same.

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
Second Mix had it.

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
Dance battle.

39:12.000 --> 39:13.000
It wasn't quite the same, though.

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
It's a start, but it's not.

39:15.000 --> 39:20.000
Those types of things have always been add-ons and not the focus of the game, if you know what I mean.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
I still think there should be a single-player type of mode in there,

39:22.000 --> 39:25.000
but I also agree about the music selections.

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
Having some of the mainstream stuff is nice,

39:27.000 --> 39:30.000
but I think the dance mania stuff is always where it was at.

39:30.000 --> 39:31.000
And a different drum, too.

39:31.000 --> 39:32.000
Can't forget them.

39:32.000 --> 39:35.000
But, boy, I really ruffled some feathers in my comments last week, though,

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
from some of the hardcore DDR people.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
I've seen a few comments.

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
Unfortunately, I stand by what I said.

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
I know it's tough to hear, but...

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
Super DDR Fighter II Turbo.

39:45.000 --> 39:51.000
It's time for DDR to innovate or go away.

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
I hate to say that, but...

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
God, it really pains me to say that, actually.

39:55.000 --> 39:58.000
But if they're not going to innovate, I'm just not interested anymore.

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
They've got their market with those 12-year-old girls, though.

40:00.000 --> 40:01.000
Hooray.

40:01.000 --> 40:02.000
Well, they can enjoy it.

40:02.000 --> 40:03.000
Yeah, really.

40:03.000 --> 40:04.000
That's it.

40:04.000 --> 40:05.000
All right.

40:05.000 --> 40:08.000
Well, let's get back into some gaming news, then.

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
And we'll go to Loki.

40:10.000 --> 40:11.000
Anyways.

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
So we talked about this before.

40:13.000 --> 40:18.000
God's already had it for a while now, but we finally just got it in time for Christmas.

40:18.000 --> 40:25.000
You'll be able to send virtual console games to friends on your friends list,

40:25.000 --> 40:29.000
barring that you have their Wii friend code.

40:29.000 --> 40:33.000
But you can gift wonderful virtual console games.

40:33.000 --> 40:37.000
So I'm sure once Guardian Legend comes out,

40:37.000 --> 40:41.000
you'll have 30 copies of Guardian Legend coming to you from all your friends.

40:41.000 --> 40:44.000
I have no problem with this.

40:44.000 --> 40:47.000
No word, though, and I haven't heard about this before.

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
What happens if you already have the game?

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
I guess you're just out of luck.

40:51.000 --> 40:52.000
Perhaps.

40:52.000 --> 40:53.000
I don't know.

40:53.000 --> 40:54.000
Or, well...

40:54.000 --> 40:59.000
No, I want to say I have heard that what happens if you already have the game

40:59.000 --> 41:03.000
is that you actually can't send the game to your friend.

41:03.000 --> 41:06.000
Like, when you try to gift it to them, it'll just bounce back and say,

41:06.000 --> 41:09.000
you can't gift this because they already have it, or something along those lines.

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
Well, then.

41:11.000 --> 41:14.000
I can't guarantee that, though, but I'm pretty sure that's what I read.

41:14.000 --> 41:15.000
So there you go.

41:15.000 --> 41:18.000
If you're interested in doing this, it's just like buying a normal virtual console game,

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
which is when you're about to pay for it.

41:20.000 --> 41:23.000
It will ask you if it's for yourself or for someone else.

41:23.000 --> 41:28.000
If it's for someone else, you just specify who, and they'll take care of the rest.

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
There are some things you can gift for free.

41:30.000 --> 41:34.000
Like, you could send the photo channel version 1.1.

41:34.000 --> 41:37.000
You could gift that to people, because even when you go in there,

41:37.000 --> 41:41.000
I haven't tried it, but there's an option to either download or gift.

41:41.000 --> 41:46.000
So if you're feeling cheap this Christmas, gift free things to your friends.

41:46.000 --> 41:49.000
It's fun.

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
I like free.

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
I think you want to watch the Metroid channel.

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
The Metroid channel.

41:55.000 --> 41:59.000
I would watch the Metroid channel if that were a real TV channel.

41:59.000 --> 42:06.000
Well, there is a little bit of news for people who like stuff on their iPhone,

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
and I'm...

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
Is that like stuff on my cat?

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
No.

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
It's as in emulation.

42:14.000 --> 42:17.000
They are in the beta state, well, near the beta stage, I should say,

42:17.000 --> 42:20.000
for an iPhone PS1 emulator,

42:20.000 --> 42:27.000
and it's called PSX number 4 iPhone emulator.

42:27.000 --> 42:32.000
They're still working on it, but hopefully they'll have something out soon

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
for all of you who want to do it,

42:34.000 --> 42:40.000
but their goal is to have it 75% compatible with all of the...

42:40.000 --> 42:46.000
Well, I'd have to say, compatible with 75% of the list of PS1 games that are out.

42:46.000 --> 42:50.000
So, hey, that'd be nice, but you know what?

42:50.000 --> 42:54.000
I'm not going to download it unless something that Apple puts out.

42:54.000 --> 42:57.000
RastoUT in chat says, unless you can plug a controller in the iPhone,

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
do not want...

42:59.000 --> 43:02.000
Looking at the screen for this that they have on here,

43:02.000 --> 43:06.000
and I'll go ahead and link that in the chat room,

43:06.000 --> 43:12.000
they've got D-pads and your trigger buttons on the screen itself,

43:12.000 --> 43:19.000
sort of running behind the game stuff itself,

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
so that still doesn't...

43:21.000 --> 43:24.000
I don't think it's going to work, so...

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
I don't think that it'll be very playable.

43:26.000 --> 43:29.000
The Nintendo one, I understand. It actually was okay.

43:29.000 --> 43:32.000
The Nintendo one looks rad. If I had an iPhone, I'd do it, except for the fact that,

43:32.000 --> 43:35.000
you know, then Apple will put the curse of death on my phone, probably.

43:35.000 --> 43:36.000
Yeah, I don't want to brick my phone.

43:36.000 --> 43:37.000
Well, exactly.

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
You already have the curse of death if you have an iPhone anyway, so...

43:39.000 --> 43:40.000
Shut up.

43:40.000 --> 43:43.000
I haven't had a single problem with mine.

43:43.000 --> 43:46.000
Oh, shiz. All right, more news.

43:46.000 --> 43:49.000
Less Apple debate, more news.

43:49.000 --> 43:54.000
Anyways, let's see here.

43:54.000 --> 43:58.000
There's going to be some new maps, apparently, for Team Fortress 2 coming,

43:58.000 --> 44:02.000
as well as some more fixes, because you can't fix that game enough.

44:02.000 --> 44:05.000
But that's kind of cool that they're having new maps, because I remember before,

44:05.000 --> 44:08.000
they only had, like, what, three maps? So that kind of sucks.

44:08.000 --> 44:13.000
But now, let's see here, they're talking about some different fixes

44:13.000 --> 44:17.000
that they're going to be having, including several gameplay exploits,

44:17.000 --> 44:22.000
plus other stuff to improve bandwidth usage and improve stats reporting,

44:22.000 --> 44:25.000
and I guess some menu bugs.

44:25.000 --> 44:29.000
I didn't really say, though, what the different levels are going to be yet,

44:29.000 --> 44:32.000
but I'm sure we'll find that out soon, because I don't think it's officially been announced.

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
Oh, my God, I do want this.

44:34.000 --> 44:37.000
What are you freaking out about over there, Dark Soccer?

44:37.000 --> 44:42.000
I was looking at Valve's website, and they have Aperture Science cups,

44:42.000 --> 44:45.000
and I do want one.

44:45.000 --> 44:50.000
It's funny, because, like, all the passion she had for DDR at one time,

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
she now has for Portal. It's amazing.

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
You know what would be fucking awesome?

44:54.000 --> 44:59.000
Like, you know how they have those stupid little light-sensored things,

44:59.000 --> 45:04.000
like the stupid frogs and stuff that you walk in front of, and they ribbit at you and stuff?

45:04.000 --> 45:08.000
They need one of those sentry guns or whatever, so when you walk past, it's all,

45:08.000 --> 45:11.000
Hello, who's there?

45:11.000 --> 45:16.000
And do all that stuff, and pop up, and we need to make that happen.

45:16.000 --> 45:17.000
That'd be pretty sweet.

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
All right, well, I've got a couple of stories for you guys.

45:19.000 --> 45:23.000
One thing I want to say is that the Word of the Year has been released by Miriam Webster,

45:23.000 --> 45:26.000
and of course, Webster is the folks that make the dictionary, right?

45:26.000 --> 45:27.000
Webster's Dictionary.

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
They have released their Word of the Year,

45:29.000 --> 45:34.000
and the reason why this relates to gaming is that the Word of the Year is Woot.

45:34.000 --> 45:40.000
That's right, W-0-0-T, Woot, is the Word of the Year.

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
I don't think I need to define what Woot means.

45:42.000 --> 45:45.000
Most gamers know Woot is like a celebration thing,

45:45.000 --> 45:48.000
and I'm just thinking, I always think about Woot.com, too, the store.

45:48.000 --> 45:49.000
You know what they have?

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
This is going to be great business for them,

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
to be the guy that owns Woot.com right now.

45:53.000 --> 45:57.000
The runner-up, by the way, was Facebook, but using it as a verb,

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
like you're going to Facebook somebody.

45:59.000 --> 46:02.000
But I always thought saying you were going to MySpace somebody

46:02.000 --> 46:03.000
was a more popular verb to use.

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
I'd just say friend somebody.

46:05.000 --> 46:06.000
Really?

46:06.000 --> 46:09.000
Yeah, I think that's a good thing to say.

46:09.000 --> 46:12.000
Turn a noun into a verb.

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
Exactly.

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
All right, well, another story I've got for you guys real quick

46:16.000 --> 46:21.000
is that Fall 2008 is now the rumored time that Killzone 2

46:21.000 --> 46:25.000
and LittleBigPlanet are both supposed to be coming out.

46:25.000 --> 46:28.000
This was from a recent post on 3Speech, which, as you know,

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
is the PlayStation blog.

46:30.000 --> 46:33.000
I guess it's kind of their major Nelson-ish thing.

46:33.000 --> 46:34.000
It's their semi-official official blog.

46:34.000 --> 46:35.000
Semi-official, yeah.

46:35.000 --> 46:36.000
Yeah, it's their blog.

46:36.000 --> 46:39.000
We're totally independent, but we're owned by something.

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
Apparently, LittleBigPlanet and Killzone 2 are not coming out

46:41.000 --> 46:45.000
until September or October next year.

46:45.000 --> 46:48.000
That's a pretty big difference from early 2008,

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
which was the original time for LittleBigPlanet.

46:50.000 --> 46:53.000
But then again, pushback should be no new news to Sony,

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
or really gaming in general.

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
It wouldn't be fair to pick on Sony in that department.

46:57.000 --> 47:01.000
Hello, Super Smash Bros. Brawl, right?

47:01.000 --> 47:02.000
Yeah.

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
But it just kind of sucks for sales because, again,

47:04.000 --> 47:07.000
without really, really killer applications,

47:07.000 --> 47:11.000
PlayStation 3s aren't going to move off-shells any faster.

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
Well, no, all the stuff that they're promising us,

47:13.000 --> 47:16.000
you know, that was supposed to be coming out so people would buy these systems.

47:16.000 --> 47:19.000
You know, I'm sure you've seen the trailers for,

47:19.000 --> 47:22.000
like, the third-party stuff that they have for PlayStation 3 now,

47:22.000 --> 47:26.000
where they're advertising Metal Gear Solid 4 like it's out right now,

47:26.000 --> 47:29.000
even though it doesn't come out until, what, like, shit,

47:29.000 --> 47:30.000
I don't even know if they have an official announcement.

47:30.000 --> 47:31.000
A long time.

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
Yeah, probably, like, March-ish, so.

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
Quick clarifications from our chat room.

47:35.000 --> 47:38.000
RasteelUT says three speeches Sony Europe,

47:38.000 --> 47:42.000
Sony USA is PlayStation.blog.

47:42.000 --> 47:43.000
Well, fine.

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
But it's still Sony, no matter what country you're in.

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
Well, if that's the case, then who knows, you know,

47:47.000 --> 47:50.000
a little big planet in Killzone being delayed to, like, the fall, you know,

47:50.000 --> 47:51.000
Europe's always getting the shaft.

47:51.000 --> 47:52.000
That's true.

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
Europe always gets the shaft in that department,

47:54.000 --> 47:57.000
but I don't know, even, that's a long shaft,

47:57.000 --> 48:00.000
if they're not getting them until the end of the year,

48:00.000 --> 48:01.000
and we're getting them at the beginning of the year.

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
Well, here's the thing I want to note.

48:03.000 --> 48:06.000
I'm not sure if SingStar is already out now in Europe.

48:06.000 --> 48:09.000
I know it's not here for the PlayStation 3 at least.

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
Maybe they're just having trouble with, like,

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
the network infrastructure or something like that,

48:13.000 --> 48:16.000
because, you know, those things like Home, you know,

48:16.000 --> 48:19.000
SingStar, this little big planet and stuff

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
that's going to have a lot of, like, you know,

48:21.000 --> 48:24.000
network backend stuff is not coming out.

48:24.000 --> 48:29.000
Is it sad that I kind of sort of want a PlayStation 3 for SingStar?

48:29.000 --> 48:30.000
Yes, it is sad.

48:30.000 --> 48:33.000
Seeing as there's countless versions for the PlayStation 2,

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
why the fuck do you need the PlayStation 3?

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
Because of the whole, like, I know my friends.

48:37.000 --> 48:38.000
Oh, because you can upload videos to YouTube.

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
Yes, and I want to do that to my friends.

48:40.000 --> 48:43.000
I want to upload videos, you know, to any other site.

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
It's just like uploading videos to YouTube.

48:45.000 --> 48:46.000
Well, how about this?

48:46.000 --> 48:49.000
Why don't you actually upload videos to YouTube?

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
Guess what? It's free to do that.

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
Instead of having to buy a game.

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
Oh, fine. Shut up.

48:55.000 --> 48:56.000
Actually, it's...

48:56.000 --> 48:59.000
Why don't you buy, you know, fucking SingStar right now,

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
because, hell, you get the microphones.

49:01.000 --> 49:02.000
They work with the PlayStation 3.

49:02.000 --> 49:03.000
Sephiroth1215 says,

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
Rob, just play Rock Band.

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
Ironically enough, I was playing Rock Band last night.

49:07.000 --> 49:08.000
One of my friends was filming me,

49:08.000 --> 49:11.000
and I wouldn't be surprised if that shit ended up on MySpace TV,

49:11.000 --> 49:12.000
or YouTube, or any of that stuff,

49:12.000 --> 49:15.000
but I hope not, because I look like an idiot when I play Rock Band.

49:15.000 --> 49:16.000
Especially the singing.

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
I was horrible.

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
Horrible, because none of those songs are in my key.

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
I would just like to share.

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
I remember you singing something in karaoke

49:26.000 --> 49:29.000
that was completely out of your key that you did, because I asked you to.

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
I got to interrupt the show real quick.

49:31.000 --> 49:32.000
Fine.

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
But this is talking about Rock Band.

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
Irene doing sabotage.

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
Oh, my God.

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
I hope that's on video somewhere,

49:40.000 --> 49:43.000
because that could possibly be funnier than the I'm staying in

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
that you did a long time ago.

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
That was so funny.

49:47.000 --> 49:50.000
It was hard to play the drums and listen to that.

49:50.000 --> 49:53.000
She's fucking hardcore. I love it.

49:53.000 --> 49:54.000
Now, what were you going to say?

49:54.000 --> 49:57.000
You sang Birdhouse in Your Soul for me.

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
I love that song.

49:59.000 --> 50:00.000
Half of it's in my key.

50:00.000 --> 50:01.000
All right.

50:01.000 --> 50:02.000
You did a good job on it, I have to say.

50:02.000 --> 50:03.000
But anyway.

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
We should go to karaoke again sometime.

50:05.000 --> 50:06.000
Let's go, although I won't sing.

50:06.000 --> 50:07.000
That's fine.

50:07.000 --> 50:08.000
We can drink.

50:08.000 --> 50:11.000
I hope that that one guy, though, who has that really, really good voice

50:11.000 --> 50:16.000
that sang Always and Forever is there.

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
Let's go, and I can sing, and you can drink.

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
Okay, that means you drive.

50:20.000 --> 50:21.000
Fair enough.

50:21.000 --> 50:22.000
All right, moving on, news.

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
Okay.

50:24.000 --> 50:27.000
Actually, this is sort of...

50:27.000 --> 50:31.000
Well, it's old news if they're on your DeviantArt friends list,

50:31.000 --> 50:37.000
but UdonKru has been working on new Street Fighter comics,

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
and they have been for quite some time.

50:39.000 --> 50:43.000
In 2008, there's a Street Fighter II Turbo comic that is to be out,

50:43.000 --> 50:47.000
and I really, really love the work that UdonKru has done on this.

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
They're also bringing out, though,

50:49.000 --> 50:54.000
a lot of the different comics that are from overseas,

50:54.000 --> 50:57.000
but they're also doing a Street Fighter Legends one

50:57.000 --> 51:03.000
that's different focus comics on different ones.

51:03.000 --> 51:11.000
They're also doing one for Street Fighter III.

51:11.000 --> 51:17.000
They're also bringing out some of the other collections that came out overseas,

51:17.000 --> 51:21.000
like they've been doing Sakura Ganbaru,

51:21.000 --> 51:24.000
which I read a long time ago in scans,

51:24.000 --> 51:28.000
but it's pretty cool.

51:28.000 --> 51:29.000
All righty.

51:29.000 --> 51:33.000
Pretty cool.

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
Yeah, you can also go on DeviantArt,

51:35.000 --> 51:39.000
and you can add Udon to your friends list,

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
and I'll get the name in a sec.

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
All right.

51:43.000 --> 51:44.000
Let's see here.

51:44.000 --> 51:48.000
Now, there's some interesting news coming out about Grand Theft Auto IV.

51:48.000 --> 51:52.000
They've rated it in Australia already, MA15+,

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
which is good for two reasons.

51:54.000 --> 51:57.000
One, it's not going to be adults only over there, at least,

51:57.000 --> 52:00.000
and I know a lot of games get banned in Australia.

52:00.000 --> 52:04.000
Two, the fact that it's actually been rated, first off,

52:04.000 --> 52:07.000
may indicate that it's actually coming out soon,

52:07.000 --> 52:10.000
and possibly within the time frame that they had originally said,

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
which was April,

52:12.000 --> 52:15.000
although the other thing, 3Speech, I believe,

52:15.000 --> 52:18.000
said that Grand Theft Auto IV was coming out around the same time

52:18.000 --> 52:21.000
as Killzone 2 and LittleBigPlanet,

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
so I hope that's not true.

52:23.000 --> 52:27.000
I hope it's actually coming out before holiday 2008.

52:27.000 --> 52:28.000
Go spring release.

52:28.000 --> 52:29.000
Come on.

52:29.000 --> 52:33.000
I need to play this game.

52:33.000 --> 52:34.000
I found it, by the way.

52:34.000 --> 52:35.000
What's that?

52:35.000 --> 52:36.000
It's udoncrew.deviantart.com.

52:36.000 --> 52:37.000
I heard it is.

52:37.000 --> 52:42.000
I find a lot of their art wallets in progress, too.

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
Well, save the last minute stories.

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
That is going to do it for our news tonight,

52:46.000 --> 52:47.000
and you know what that means.

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
It's time to open up the telephones

52:49.000 --> 52:50.000
and let you guys have a say.

52:50.000 --> 52:53.000
If you'd like to give us a call, it's 1-877-GAME-OLR.

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
We've been doing the Skype thing for a long time.

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
Of course, Skype is a free program

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
that allows you to call us using your computer if you have a headset.

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
However, if you are going to use Skype,

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
I encourage you, if you've never called the show before,

53:05.000 --> 53:09.000
please call ECHO123 on Skype first,

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
because that way you can test your connection,

53:11.000 --> 53:14.000
and when you call us, you don't sound like shite.

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
But in the meantime, we have a call, and let's take that call.

53:16.000 --> 53:17.000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
Who's this?

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
It's Ronbo. How are you guys doing tonight?

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
Good, Ronbo. How are you doing, my friend?

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
Good, good, good.

53:25.000 --> 53:29.000
Last week I went to my final anime con of the year,

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
and I have some gaming stuffs for you.

53:31.000 --> 53:34.000
Really? You got me stuffs?

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
Yeah, I mean, just some gaming information.

53:36.000 --> 53:39.000
It's not much, because I was working the whole weekend,

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
because my roommate has a company now,

53:41.000 --> 53:44.000
so I was helping him peddle his wares.

53:44.000 --> 53:47.000
Cool. Well, what kind of stuffs?

53:47.000 --> 53:50.000
Well, first off, I was talking to a couple of people

53:50.000 --> 53:53.000
that were running the gaming room at New York Anime Fest,

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
and things were a little bit different.

53:55.000 --> 53:59.000
They wanted to be different from normal gaming rooms,

53:59.000 --> 54:02.000
so there was no Bimani there this year,

54:02.000 --> 54:07.000
including no rock band or guitar hero or anything like that.

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
Good for them taking a stand, because honestly,

54:09.000 --> 54:10.000
most of the people that go to those cons

54:10.000 --> 54:13.000
have all that shit at home, don't they?

54:13.000 --> 54:14.000
Pretty much.

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
So there you go.

54:16.000 --> 54:21.000
They had more anime-based games and other RPGs and stuff,

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
but there were a couple of instances

54:23.000 --> 54:27.000
that did happen in the gaming room from what I was told.

54:27.000 --> 54:33.000
A DS got stolen with a game that was in development,

54:33.000 --> 54:36.000
and some other guy tried to steal another DS,

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
but he got caught doing it.

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
Aw, you know that DS game in development's

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
going to be up on the internet any day now.

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
Probably you're already up there.

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
I don't even know which game it was.

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
Interesting.

54:48.000 --> 54:51.000
Also, while I was there,

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
I was working for a couple other websites,

54:53.000 --> 54:56.000
and one of my friends runs a site called Gaming Angels,

54:56.000 --> 54:59.000
so I was running around getting pictures

54:59.000 --> 55:02.000
of female cosplayers doing gaming stuffs.

55:02.000 --> 55:05.000
I could tell you the most popular gaming cosplayers

55:05.000 --> 55:10.000
pretty much was Yuna from Final Fantasy X and Final Fantasy X-2.

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
That's kind of not a surprise.

55:12.000 --> 55:16.000
I've seen a lot of Yunas of all shapes and sizes at anime cons.

55:16.000 --> 55:17.000
Pretty much.

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
Here's a picture I'm about to post in the chat room

55:19.000 --> 55:20.000
of something interesting.

55:20.000 --> 55:25.000
There's one girl I met who did Lolita Link for Legend of Zelda.

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
Lolita Link?

55:27.000 --> 55:28.000
Yep, Lolita Link.

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
I just posted a link in the chat.

55:30.000 --> 55:31.000
This I have to see.

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
Yeah, that was great.

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
That's interesting.

55:35.000 --> 55:39.000
Yay, Slutty Link.

55:39.000 --> 55:43.000
This next picture is for you.

55:43.000 --> 55:46.000
Since this is horrible radio, when you send pictures,

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
describe for our listeners what you're sending.

55:48.000 --> 55:53.000
The second picture is a person cosplaying night.

55:53.000 --> 55:54.000
Nice.

55:54.000 --> 55:55.000
I did see that one.

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
That's cute.

55:57.000 --> 56:02.000
This next one is a picture of a prize that you probably enjoyed

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
when I sent it to your cell phone.

56:04.000 --> 56:10.000
This is my friend dressed up as Pit from Smash Bros. Ball.

56:10.000 --> 56:13.000
I got a random text message from Rama over the weekend

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
with a lady dressed as Pit.

56:15.000 --> 56:16.000
That's hardcore, though.

56:16.000 --> 56:17.000
I like that.

56:17.000 --> 56:18.000
Good for her.

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
I hope she wants something.

56:20.000 --> 56:23.000
I'm not sure, but I can always ask because she's a good friend of mine.

56:23.000 --> 56:26.000
I know Jamie is a big fan of Silent Hill,

56:26.000 --> 56:29.000
so I found the girl who did Pyramid Head.

56:29.000 --> 56:32.000
That's cool, yeah.

56:32.000 --> 56:37.000
The last two pictures, I got to say, are my personal favorites.

56:37.000 --> 56:38.000
You like Final Fight?

56:38.000 --> 56:39.000
Oh, yeah.

56:39.000 --> 56:42.000
I've got almost every version that they put out at home.

56:42.000 --> 56:45.000
Well, there's this guy walking around with a shirt that says,

56:45.000 --> 56:48.000
I got OA on the front.

56:48.000 --> 56:52.000
And on the back, it says, and I quote,

56:52.000 --> 56:56.000
a turkey in every horror drum and a fist in every face.

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
Yes.

56:58.000 --> 56:59.000
That was great.

56:59.000 --> 57:03.000
That's great.

57:03.000 --> 57:06.000
I like how it's just some dude wearing this shirt like,

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
yeah, I got my Haggar OA shirt.

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
A turkey in every oil drum and a fist in every face.

57:10.000 --> 57:14.000
That's amazing.

57:14.000 --> 57:15.000
I want that shirt.

57:15.000 --> 57:16.000
He should market that.

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
Some other folks in chat are saying they want that shirt, too.

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
That shirt is fantastic.

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
Well, since the pictures are posted,

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
maybe I'll end up hearing from the guy.

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
I could find out more information about the shirt.

57:26.000 --> 57:30.000
I have a feeling he made it himself, which is pretty damn cool.

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
You know, I was just thinking, you know, at Orange Lawns Radio,

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
we should open a t-shirt shop and not just sell official

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
Orange Lawns Radio t-shirts like finally,

57:36.000 --> 57:39.000
but really funny gamer nerd shirts such as that.

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
Now, I mean, obviously we wouldn't steal that idea,

57:41.000 --> 57:44.000
but we could come up with other things that are just as funny, right?

57:44.000 --> 57:45.000
Like, we should get a shirt that says,

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
Rate Me Pyramid Head on it,

57:47.000 --> 57:50.000
with a little chibi pyramid head on it.

57:50.000 --> 57:53.000
I mean, I'd wear that in public, wouldn't you?

57:53.000 --> 57:54.000
I definitely would.

57:54.000 --> 57:55.000
See?

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
I ran across this shirt this weekend that said,

57:57.000 --> 58:00.000
Mario, Luigi, oh, wait.

58:00.000 --> 58:03.000
And by the way, patent pending on the Rate Me Pyramid Head shirt.

58:03.000 --> 58:06.000
If you steal that idea, I'll sue you for a million dollars.

58:06.000 --> 58:07.000
We have it. We have proof.

58:07.000 --> 58:08.000
It's being recorded.

58:08.000 --> 58:09.000
Exactly.

58:09.000 --> 58:10.000
All right.

58:10.000 --> 58:11.000
Well, Rahm, anything else you want to share with our listeners?

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
I'm glad to hear you had fun at the con.

58:13.000 --> 58:14.000
I'm glad.

58:14.000 --> 58:19.000
That's pretty much it, and we want the New York chapter of OLR.

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
I want you guys to come out to Anime Next,

58:21.000 --> 58:24.000
and we're working with some friends to try to get you guys out here.

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
When is that?

58:26.000 --> 58:29.000
I believe it's the first or second weekend of June.

58:29.000 --> 58:30.000
They just announced their date.

58:30.000 --> 58:33.000
Just in time for my birthday.

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
Hey, if you make it out for your birthday, we'll take you out.

58:35.000 --> 58:38.000
I mean, I celebrate my birthday with you guys for fun,

58:38.000 --> 58:39.000
and it's only fair, you know?

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
And speaking of which, are you coming back this year?

58:41.000 --> 58:45.000
Because I do believe we were promised Rama in 08.

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
I thought I said 09.

58:47.000 --> 58:48.000
I think it was 09.

58:48.000 --> 58:49.000
Every other year.

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
I was trying to switch it up.

58:51.000 --> 58:52.000
I'm sorry.

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
All right.

58:54.000 --> 58:55.000
Have a good one, Rama.

58:55.000 --> 58:56.000
Thanks for calling.

58:56.000 --> 58:57.000
All right, you guys take care.

58:57.000 --> 58:58.000
Bye-bye.

58:58.000 --> 58:59.000
Bye.

58:59.000 --> 59:02.000
DMN says Roberts and Summers in 08 would be the ticket.

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
I don't know what that leaves Loki to do.

59:04.000 --> 59:05.000
Loki would have to be the official...

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
He'd be Secretary of State.

59:07.000 --> 59:08.000
Well, he's court jester.

59:08.000 --> 59:09.000
He is what he is.

59:09.000 --> 59:13.000
He can be Speaker of the House.

59:13.000 --> 59:17.000
Actually, he can be the pet at the White House, like Socks the Cat.

59:17.000 --> 59:18.000
We have Loki.

59:18.000 --> 59:19.000
I don't know.

59:19.000 --> 59:20.000
Anyway, we've got another caller.

59:20.000 --> 59:21.000
Jeremy!

59:21.000 --> 59:22.000
All right, fine.

59:22.000 --> 59:23.000
Jeremy is the official pet.

59:23.000 --> 59:24.000
Let me get to the caller.

59:24.000 --> 59:25.000
Hi, you're on Orange House Radio.

59:25.000 --> 59:26.000
Who's this?

59:26.000 --> 59:27.000
GS68.

59:27.000 --> 59:28.000
Oh my God, GS68.

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
You've been on the show in many ways tonight.

59:30.000 --> 59:33.000
Now you're calling us when you were already on the mailbag?

59:33.000 --> 59:34.000
It's all good.

59:34.000 --> 59:35.000
What's up?

59:35.000 --> 59:41.000
First of all, I thought the ferret was the official pet of the caller.

59:41.000 --> 59:42.000
Good point.

59:42.000 --> 59:43.000
The ferret...

59:43.000 --> 59:44.000
We don't know where the ferret is.

59:44.000 --> 59:47.000
The ferret will not stab you in the face and in fact cannot speak.

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
The ferret is MIA.

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
And now we should sell shirts with ferrets on them.

59:51.000 --> 59:52.000
And it's just a ferret.

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
Actually, I think I've seen that before.

59:54.000 --> 59:55.000
Never mind, we can't do that.

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
I don't want to get sued.

59:57.000 --> 59:58.000
What's on your mind?

59:58.000 --> 59:59.000
Certainly you have something game-related.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Yeah, today I went to the GameStop Tournament Edition, which is what I like to call it.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Oh, you've been to the new place that we were talking about earlier in the program.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.000
What was it like?

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
What was up with it?

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:20.000
First, there's a bottle of kiosks over there where you can play games and such.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:30.000
Over in the house where you normally buy games and stuff, they also have a bunch of kiosks over there.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:36.000
Now, did it look like a normal GameStop otherwise, with just a bunch of additional kiosks?

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:45.000
Well, actually, no, because they have this big stage where there's a whole bunch of gaming kiosks.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:50.000
And I presume that's for tournaments and stuff.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
Interesting.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:55.000
I was going to ask about, was something going on?

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:58.000
Were they actually doing a tournament when you were there today, or was it just kind of open?

01:00:58.000 --> 01:00:59.000
Actually, no.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:00.000
It was a regular day.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
So what did they do during the regular day?

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:05.000
Are they just open for people to play games for free?

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
Yeah, I guess.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
Wow. That's kind of cool.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:18.000
Yes, I was driving down to Stevens Creek, and what caught my attention was the subtitle under the GameStop logo by Barnes & Noble.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
Where exactly is this GameStop located?

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:27.000
It's on the corner of San Tomas Expressway and Stevens Creek Boulevard in San Jose.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
Oh, shit, I know where that is. That's funny.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Huh.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:35.000
I might have to check that out at some point, because I go to, it's right next to the Barnes & Noble.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:39.000
Yeah, I kind of know where that is. I go down that area quite often.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:44.000
I go to Menlo Park almost every other week, so I might have to check that out. Very cool.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:49.000
All right, well, anything else you want to share with our listeners after your trip today?

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:50.000
No.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:54.000
All right, well, have a good one, and thanks for the first-hand report from being down there.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.000
Thanks, you too.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
All right, take care.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:02.000
If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR. Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:06.000
Keep in mind that the 877 number is toll-free, but only for those folks in the U.S. and Canada.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:10.000
I know we have listeners overseas. The 877 won't work for you, but you can use Skype.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
Skype is international, and it's free.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:17.000
While we wait for some calls, how about some last-minute stories? Anybody, last-minute story?

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
I like fire.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:20.000
That's not news.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:28.000
Well, there's apparently a possibility that an 18-plus version of No More Heroes may actually happen in the future for Europe,

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:32.000
so fear not. You may get your uncut version of the game.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:36.000
There's a funny little Wiimote candy dispenser that's out there now.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:43.000
If you go to candyaddict.com, you can buy a Wiimote candy dispenser.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:47.000
Perfect gift for those kids who may not be able to get a Wii this Christmas.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:51.000
Give them an IOU and a Wii candy dispenser.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:52.000
What a shitty alternative.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
Let's go to the phones. We have another call.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
Hello, this is RosteelUT.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:01.000
Hello, RosteelUT. What is on your mind?

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:02.000
Hello.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:08.000
Not much. I was just looking at the November NPDs a few days ago,

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:14.000
and it's pretty damn shocking to see how well some of these games have turned out.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:18.000
Call of Duty 4 has just been ridiculous.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
There's been a lot of sales.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:24.000
The one thing that's been on my mind, and I mentioned this earlier in the chat,

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:28.000
is that it's great that the Wii is selling all this hardware,

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
but is it really growing a market?

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:35.000
You look at all these games that are found, there's a lot of good third-party games.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:43.000
It's not like there's nothing on there, but it's like nothing is found on a market.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:46.000
The thing that gets to me is are these people ever going to buy games,

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:51.000
or is it just going to be the same people buying the same four games over and over again?

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:55.000
I think there are a shitload of people that are buying the system just for Wii Sports,

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:58.000
because that's the game that Nintendo's been very good at getting out there

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
and creating a fad out of.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:06.000
Think about the way most people think about video games in their mind.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:11.000
A lot of folks don't even realize that this thing is a system capable of playing a multitude of games,

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:14.000
but the way that it's been marketed to the soccer moms and everything is,

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:18.000
as Wii Sports, get up and move your butt while you play games.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
Play fake tennis and all that stuff.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:24.000
They've done an amazing job in that regard.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:28.000
The question is, I mentioned Zack and Wiki in the chat.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:31.000
I mentioned more heroes.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:35.000
Even Rayman 2 has been doing pretty well, but not anywhere near as good as the first one,

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:40.000
which was launch titles, and launch titles always have a lucky streak.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:46.000
If all we're getting is people buying it for Wii Sports,

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:51.000
is it ever going to be anything more than just a toy, basically?

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:55.000
Is it ever going to be anything that anyone who actually wants more than one game is going to want to have?

01:04:55.000 --> 01:05:00.000
I do, because I think Nintendo is going to try to make Wii Fit the next fad.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:04.000
My gut tells me, the way Nintendo's been going with the market lately,

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:07.000
I think they are really going to try and make Wii Fit massive.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:13.000
They're going to try and get it out there on the Today Show and on Oprah and all that shit,

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:17.000
and that's going to be their next thing that they're going to push and try to get in every home.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:20.000
I expect Wii Fit to do well.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:23.000
All these stupid little fitness products always do well.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:29.000
The question I'm asking is, you see the 360s, and even the PS3 to some extent.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:32.000
The PS3 has you good selling games this month.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:37.000
Is it ever going to be whether Wii is a vibrant market,

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:43.000
or is it just going to continue to be hostile to everybody who was Nintendo?

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:47.000
That's the real question.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:50.000
You mentioned, of course, movie games and all that,

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:56.000
but a lot of people don't even look at the movie games.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
It's shocking.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:01.000
Even traditional high-selling games.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:04.000
I was talking to this guy a couple of weeks ago.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:10.000
EA butted heads with Nintendo so they could put the 32 multiplayer online in Medal of Honor Heroes 2.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:17.000
They had the Madden online for 08 where it works with EA Nation instead of the friend codes,

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
and they're not being rewarded.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:23.000
The third parties are trying, some of them.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:28.000
Of course, no more Heroes is a tragedy.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:32.000
Has that even been released here yet?

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
It was released in Japan.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:38.000
Kotaku had a piece on it a couple of weeks ago,

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:43.000
where Suda51 actually went to a huge game store in Akihabara.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:44.000
Nobody went there.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
He was going to go sign games.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:49.000
They had piles of toilet paper that you could buy or get for free.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
Yeah, they were giving the toilet paper away.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
They had a model.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:57.000
It was a big launch event and nobody came.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:01.000
That just made me sad, really.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:02.000
It's not just that game.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
It's Zack and Wiki.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:07.000
One of my favorite games, Mercury Meltdown Revolution.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
I don't think that sold very well.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:10.000
Look at the box art for that game.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:14.000
That isn't something that really jumps out at you as something you should buy.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:15.000
What, Zack and Wiki?

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:18.000
No, the Mercury Meltdown Revolution.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
Yeah, Mercury Meltdown.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
I could see you with Mercury Meltdown.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:27.000
But Zack and Wiki, that screams family friendly.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:30.000
It's a very adorable looking game.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:33.000
It's not that hard.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:41.000
Yeah, Capcom could have advertised it better, but given the ridiculous sales of this system,

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:46.000
you'd think that more games would just sell on accident, considering how many of these

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:47.000
systems there are.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:51.000
One thing the NPD doesn't account for, though, that I'd be curious to know a little more

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:54.000
is the virtual console sales.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:59.000
I bet that's doing crazy business that if we saw the numbers, we'd get sick over the

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
fact that how many games people might use a cheaper...

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:05.000
Well, Nintendo mentioned that they made $33 million on the virtual console, which isn't

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:06.000
bad, considering.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:07.000
I mean, shit.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:10.000
That's not bad at all.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:17.000
I would be very interested, considering how much of a hassle it is with the Wii to get

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:22.000
online sometimes, at least with the wireless, I do not understand why they didn't have an

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:23.000
Ethernet port right there.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:24.000
I don't understand that.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:30.000
That $33 million is literally free money to them, is literally free money right out of

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:31.000
thin air.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:32.000
Of course.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:33.000
It's all old games.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:38.000
I mean, granted, they have to write those manuals and do the QA testing and all that

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:42.000
stuff, but that's pennies compared to the bigger picture, you know what I mean?

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:46.000
I'm sure a skill programmer could do that in an hour.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:52.000
That's my concern, because I have all three systems.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:09:02.440
I want Nintendo to be successful, but I don't want a system that nobody's buying games for

01:09:02.440 --> 01:09:09.760
eventually taking the rest of the industry down with it, because you see the trends.

01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:14.880
You see more of these little minigame crap coming out, and personally, I don't blame

01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:18.680
the third parties, because if they're not going to get big sales, they may as well go for

01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:20.680
the quick buck.

01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:30.880
But that could end up hurting the Wii after the Wii Sports fat is done or if the Wii Fit

01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:35.360
doesn't work very well here.

01:09:35.360 --> 01:09:39.440
Nintendo is riding on the real thin ground if they don't at least try to get the quality

01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:46.440
control up and try to help people realize, hey, this thing has other games.

01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:48.440
Mario Galaxy didn't do as well in Japan.

01:09:48.440 --> 01:09:50.440
What the hell?

01:09:50.440 --> 01:09:54.480
That is a little bit surprising.

01:09:54.480 --> 01:10:02.120
I thought Mario Galaxy was going to do a million in a week, honestly, because it's Mario.

01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:03.680
It's freaking Mario.

01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:08.080
Anyways, I've been ranting too long, and I'm sure a whole lot of people want to get on

01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:10.080
the line, so I'll see you next week, all right?

01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:11.080
All right.

01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:12.080
We've got to let you go anyway for time, but take care, buddy.

01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:13.080
Thanks for the phone.

01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:14.080
You're doing fine.

01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:15.080
Bye-bye.

01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:16.080
Bye-bye.

01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:17.080
All right.

01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:18.080
I think that's actually going to do it for calls tonight, because we're running a little

01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:20.920
bit long tonight, so we're going to go ahead and start to wrap up the program.

01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:24.400
I do want to check and see if there's any more last-minute stories.

01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:26.160
Yeah.

01:10:26.160 --> 01:10:27.160
Let's see here real quick.

01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:30.440
I was just going to mention a few things that were kind of funny.

01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:35.480
There's actually a game coming out in Europe, and this is really sad, called MTV Fan Attack,

01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:45.800
and it looks like you're a VJ running from fans, interesting, wonderful shit, and then

01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:49.720
this will piss off my wife really bad.

01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:55.080
Her big complaint, you remember, Rob, you probably remember her complaint about this,

01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:56.840
the Golden Compass movie.

01:10:56.840 --> 01:11:00.060
Apparently, the ending was not like the book.

01:11:00.060 --> 01:11:07.120
There's a major scene that's cut out of the movie, not to give away any spoilers, but

01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:08.120
I will.

01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:13.880
Apparently, a kid gets killed or sacrificed to open a portal.

01:11:13.880 --> 01:11:19.600
Hey, if that wasn't a portal, that would make the game even better, sacrificing bratty kids,

01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:24.880
but apparently that footage, though, is in the game if you finish the game, so I will

01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:28.560
have to show this to her tonight, and I'm sure a director's cut of the movie will be

01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:34.320
in order.

01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:38.320
Anything else from Last Minute News Tonight?

01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:41.520
No, that's a Famitsu cover.

01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:49.520
That's kind of funny for No More Heroes, and then they have a new wallpaper up on the No

01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:53.880
More Heroes website, which this will now be my new wallpaper, if Rob would want to take

01:11:53.880 --> 01:12:01.720
a look here with him charging his beam saber.

01:12:01.720 --> 01:12:06.080
Dark Soccer, do you have anything last minute for us?

01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:07.080
I like pie.

01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:10.080
That's not a spoiler.

01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:11.080
No.

01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:12.080
All right.

01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:18.560
Anyhow, let's go around and get final thoughts for our program, because we're going to wrap

01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:20.400
this up and call it a week.

01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:22.280
Loki, your final thought?

01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:25.680
I hope we can fix my computer situation early.

01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:30.680
I actually thought of something during the show that I need to check on, because my power

01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:34.040
supply apparently has a turbo mode on it, and a normal mode.

01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:39.520
The normal mode has the 12 volt rail broken up into four different rails, whereas turbo

01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:44.720
has it on one, and I'm wondering if I maybe switch that if it'll work, although I still

01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:49.080
think that the motherboard or graphics card is broken, so we'll see.

01:12:49.080 --> 01:12:54.200
I get to play tons of games this week, taking Wednesday through Friday off to play games.

01:12:54.200 --> 01:12:57.280
My final thought is I have a two and a half week vacation coming up.

01:12:57.280 --> 01:13:01.320
I just have to get through one more week of work to get there, and I'm so excited, and

01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:05.880
I'm going to play a lot of games too, and I'm going to work on Orange Lawn's radio stuffs,

01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:06.880
which will be fun.

01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:07.880
Jamie, your final thought?

01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:13.840
I need to get Orange Box on PC so I can use the editor to put the Half-Life 2 maps in

01:13:13.840 --> 01:13:16.960
Portal and use the Portal gun in Half-Life.

01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:18.360
Fun.

01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:19.360
You get to work on that.

01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:20.360
All right.

01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:21.360
Eventually.

01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:22.360
Eventually.

01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:26.600
All right, well, thank you very much for tuning into our program tonight and supporting independent

01:13:26.600 --> 01:13:28.040
podcasting and independent radio.

01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:29.040
We really appreciate it.

01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:32.760
Remember, if you like our show, tell two people you know about the program.

01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:36.600
That way, we slowly begin to take over the world as more and more people discover our

01:13:36.600 --> 01:13:37.600
little program.

01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:42.400
Remember, there will be no live show next week with us on December 23rd.

01:13:42.400 --> 01:13:48.200
There will be something for the live listeners on the stream with some of our other OLR personalities,

01:13:48.200 --> 01:13:50.520
but Dark Soccer and myself and Loki will have the night off.

01:13:50.520 --> 01:13:55.760
So we will see you back on the podcast on December 30th for the year-end review show.

01:13:55.760 --> 01:13:56.760
So see you then.

01:13:56.760 --> 01:13:57.760
Bye-bye.

01:13:57.760 --> 01:13:58.760
