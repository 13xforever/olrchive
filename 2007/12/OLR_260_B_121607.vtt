[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly To listen to the first half of this episode visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio

00:19.773 --> 00:20.193
[SPEAKER_06]: Temptation Sonata

00:48.757 --> 00:52.760
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of like this song.

00:54.321 --> 00:56.642
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe it was even a cage match pick at one time.

00:57.222 --> 01:05.027
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, you may remember that the video featured blatant rip-offs of scenes from Advent Children.

01:05.687 --> 01:12.131
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, apparently Square Enix won a case against them for plagiarism.

01:12.771 --> 01:13.512
[SPEAKER_04]: And to the tune of,

01:15.479 --> 01:18.181
[SPEAKER_04]: 16 million won, or $17,400.

01:18.221 --> 01:23.665
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess the won is like pesos, apparently.

01:26.247 --> 01:26.748
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah.

01:28.369 --> 01:29.750
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well.

01:29.990 --> 01:30.591
[SPEAKER_04]: $17,000, that's not bad.

01:31.511 --> 01:32.872
[SPEAKER_06]: But the video was pretty cool.

01:33.253 --> 01:35.034
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I don't know if you saw it.

01:35.114 --> 01:35.895
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen it.

01:35.975 --> 01:38.277
[SPEAKER_01]: She had like two other good songs on the album, too.

01:38.977 --> 01:43.481
[SPEAKER_04]: It was neat because it was, you know, Advent Children, but other than that, it was, you know,

01:45.100 --> 01:45.660
[SPEAKER_06]: Operator 11, our bandwidth

02:15.270 --> 02:19.433
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:41.752 --> 02:46.375
[SPEAKER_06]: Final Fantasy IV is getting a sequel, and this to me is awesome news.

02:46.475 --> 02:51.779
[SPEAKER_06]: I am so happy because Final Fantasy IV is my favorite in the entire Final Fantasy series.

02:51.879 --> 03:01.064
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, say what you will, Final Fantasy VII, rah, rah, rah, Final Fantasy IX, or not IX, Final Fantasy VI, well, something like IX, but Final Fantasy VI, rah, rah, rah, there's always that back and forth.

03:01.305 --> 03:03.166
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a soft spot in my heart for Final Fantasy IV.

03:03.806 --> 03:04.687
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

03:33.428 --> 03:34.829
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

04:04.505 --> 04:07.586
[SPEAKER_06]: I was so angsty when I read this news earlier in the week.

04:07.646 --> 04:08.427
[SPEAKER_06]: I said, you know what?

04:08.567 --> 04:12.228
[SPEAKER_06]: I know what segment I want to have follow this news story when we read it this week.

04:22.293 --> 04:30.036
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, it's the FUs of the week, and Jamie's going to start us off.

04:30.620 --> 04:34.661
[SPEAKER_01]: My FU of the week goes towards the doctor that I saw who is not my regular doctor.

04:35.641 --> 04:38.062
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, I'm not an idiot.

04:38.742 --> 04:41.022
[SPEAKER_01]: You can tell me what's freaking wrong.

04:41.362 --> 04:43.503
[SPEAKER_01]: You can tell me what you suspect to be wrong.

04:44.383 --> 04:47.704
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I usually can follow what you're saying.

04:48.104 --> 04:49.704
[SPEAKER_01]: My doctor is great, okay?

04:50.584 --> 04:58.286
[SPEAKER_01]: If ever I remotely suspect anything is wrong or have an idea of what might be the cause, because you know me, I'll research the crap out of everything.

04:58.786 --> 04:59.726
[SPEAKER_01]: He listens to me.

05:00.385 --> 05:28.324
[SPEAKER_01]: and then he actually tests for the stuff that I suggest which is how we found out how to treat chronic fatigue for me so that I could actually not pass out on a daily basis or be hurt or anything what happened is when I was in Alabama and I don't know how I did it but my right hand ring finger the tendon started to catch and I wouldn't be able to lift my finger in the morning unless I massaged it and got blood flowing

05:29.068 --> 05:56.822
[SPEAKER_01]: and it was really inflamed along the tendon that goes down my palm so I went to see this doctor and my regular doctor I guess was out for the holidays or something so you know he tested it and you know I had been icing it and doing all the right stuff but he said okay we're gonna give you a cortisone shot I was like what's actually wrong with it oh it's fine we'll just do the shot and so he didn't tell me anything so I actually I got a cortisone shot in my hand

05:58.560 --> 05:59.881
[SPEAKER_01]: And he wouldn't let me watch it either.

05:59.941 --> 06:00.701
[SPEAKER_01]: It pissed me off.

06:01.061 --> 06:04.243
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I actually, I don't have the fear of needles that I used to.

06:05.143 --> 06:07.004
[SPEAKER_01]: I give myself a shot in the leg twice a week.

06:07.044 --> 06:09.125
[SPEAKER_01]: I can stand watching a needle in my hand.

06:09.685 --> 06:14.867
[SPEAKER_01]: So he said he wouldn't do it until I would not watch him put the needle in.

06:15.207 --> 06:17.388
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, dude, I'm not going to pass out.

06:17.428 --> 06:18.949
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, are you squeamish?

06:19.009 --> 06:19.869
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going to pass out?

06:19.889 --> 06:21.690
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, no.

06:22.570 --> 06:25.912
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it took me looking up the symptoms myself.

06:26.886 --> 06:29.747
[SPEAKER_01]: And then looking up the treatments, I realized that he was treating me for trigger finger.

06:31.808 --> 06:35.789
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is funny, because my grandma and I actually just had surgery on that one, like, about a month ago.

06:35.809 --> 06:37.790
[SPEAKER_01]: Runs in the family, right?

06:38.831 --> 06:39.571
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not hereditary.

06:40.011 --> 06:40.171
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.

06:40.411 --> 06:47.274
[SPEAKER_01]: Trigger finger has to do with inflammation of the tendons, and that it's slipping out of the tendon sheath that goes over the tendons.

06:47.294 --> 06:48.254
[SPEAKER_06]: Then it's just irony.

06:48.914 --> 06:51.135
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's coincidence.

06:53.096 --> 06:55.137
[SPEAKER_01]: However, I will go ahead and say that...

06:56.508 --> 06:58.229
[SPEAKER_01]: I am having a lot less pain in the hand.

06:58.289 --> 07:00.771
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be another few days before the cortisone takes full effect.

07:01.231 --> 07:02.572
[SPEAKER_01]: And I start physical therapy next week.

07:02.672 --> 07:05.094
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, you know, fun, but not.

07:05.974 --> 07:13.880
[SPEAKER_01]: So, FU to doctors who do not communicate with their patients.

07:14.760 --> 07:15.081
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

07:15.421 --> 07:17.002
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to go back and see my regular doctor.

07:17.402 --> 07:17.882
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's move on.

07:17.922 --> 07:18.703
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, your FU.

07:20.064 --> 07:26.208
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, my FU of the week, not a big surprise, to EBGA for giving me a card that's

07:26.790 --> 07:55.998
[SPEAKER_04]: Dead on Arrival and for the other thing also for the card being a gimp version of the normal card that should have been or the motherboard being a gimp version of that with no possible way for me to know what's going wrong when there is something going wrong so now I just have to kind of guess it'll be the last time I buy a motherboard from them and it'll probably be the last time I buy a motherboard from Newegg as well because they apparently are pawning off crap that's gimp versions of the real thing so that sucks

07:57.042 --> 07:58.023
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll buy from Fry's.

07:58.043 --> 08:05.547
[SPEAKER_04]: So that way if it sucks and it's not working, I can take it right back the next day or the same day instead of having to do this whole arming process.

08:07.808 --> 08:08.608
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, is that it?

08:09.149 --> 08:09.509
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

08:09.849 --> 08:11.670
[SPEAKER_06]: My FU of the week goes to Mondays.

08:12.490 --> 08:13.171
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll keep it short.

08:13.231 --> 08:14.591
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate Mondays as do we all.

08:14.631 --> 08:19.954
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, Jamie, when you get that controlling time thing figured out, can you figure out a way to do away with Mondays?

08:21.475 --> 08:23.416
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we should just give Monday a different name.

08:24.357 --> 08:24.917
[SPEAKER_06]: Fun Day!

08:25.017 --> 08:26.498
[SPEAKER_01]: But it would be the same thing.

08:27.017 --> 08:28.398
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I don't like that idea.

08:29.058 --> 08:29.858
[SPEAKER_06]: Some days are horrible.

08:30.919 --> 08:32.179
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so that's it.

08:32.219 --> 08:33.179
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my FU of the week.

08:34.460 --> 08:36.301
[SPEAKER_06]: Now we can get back into some gaming news, can't we?

08:36.921 --> 08:37.761
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, we can.

08:40.722 --> 08:42.283
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we have some news.

08:43.887 --> 08:55.099
[SPEAKER_01]: For our friends who are interested in GameTap, we will be having Street Fighter 3 Third Strike as of December 20th.

08:55.539 --> 09:00.304
[SPEAKER_01]: No online play, but it's Street Fighter 3 Third Strike.

09:01.686 --> 09:02.827
[SPEAKER_01]: So hey, that's good.

09:05.014 --> 09:14.020
[SPEAKER_01]: And on top of that, if you've got the Capcom joystick, I think they actually do have some compatibility with it through GameTap.

09:14.941 --> 09:16.842
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been a long time since I've used that service.

09:16.983 --> 09:21.025
[SPEAKER_06]: I was kind of sad about the games leaving, and I guess they did some client upgrade.

09:21.045 --> 09:22.066
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't even checked it out yet.

09:23.447 --> 09:27.690
[SPEAKER_06]: If I'm not playing it enough, I ought to just cancel the darn thing, but there's still a lot about it I like.

09:28.070 --> 09:28.431
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

09:30.832 --> 09:31.773
[SPEAKER_06]: Moving on with more news.

09:32.834 --> 09:33.014
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

09:34.376 --> 09:40.261
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, so, I don't know, this isn't really a big surprise for me, but Mass Effect is selling very well.

09:40.781 --> 09:42.783
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, they've sold millions.

09:43.563 --> 09:51.890
[SPEAKER_04]: And over the three weeks since launch, they have sold over one million units globally.

09:52.891 --> 09:55.893
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, that should be pretty good, I guess.

09:55.913 --> 09:58.295
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, it's a good game.

09:58.595 --> 10:00.576
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to sell a million copies of anything.

10:00.616 --> 10:02.878
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that would be pretty good for business, I would think.

10:03.699 --> 10:03.819
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

10:04.378 --> 10:05.559
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, millions of copies.

10:06.780 --> 10:10.583
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet a lot of people would like certain other games to sell a million copies worldwide.

10:10.623 --> 10:11.544
[SPEAKER_06]: Like the Eye of Judgment?

10:12.765 --> 10:13.046
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe.

10:13.306 --> 10:13.546
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe.

10:14.073 --> 10:15.214
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

10:43.359 --> 10:43.960
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

11:13.581 --> 11:14.422
[SPEAKER_06]: Assassin's Creed has sold a bunch.

11:37.307 --> 11:44.509
[SPEAKER_01]: They have sold 2.5 million copies globally and they've sold a whole bunch more than they thought it would.

11:45.770 --> 11:49.891
[SPEAKER_01]: They are hoping to reach 5 million by March 08.

11:51.032 --> 11:52.632
[SPEAKER_06]: And I still have yet to play the damn game.

11:53.052 --> 11:53.933
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I have it.

11:53.973 --> 11:55.093
[SPEAKER_01]: You can probably borrow mine.

11:56.621 --> 11:56.881
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

11:56.901 --> 12:04.108
[SPEAKER_06]: I kind of want to play it before our year-end show, because I hear a lot of people saying it's a great game and deserves to be on year-end's best list.

12:04.148 --> 12:07.210
[SPEAKER_06]: So it won't make mine, though, if I don't ever get a chance to play it.

12:07.270 --> 12:09.072
[SPEAKER_06]: So I may take you up on that, Jamie.

12:10.333 --> 12:11.714
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you play Assassin's Creed, Loki?

12:11.874 --> 12:13.556
[SPEAKER_06]: You talked about it.

12:13.576 --> 12:14.617
[SPEAKER_06]: But you didn't like it, right?

12:14.977 --> 12:15.237
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

12:15.377 --> 12:16.298
[SPEAKER_06]: What was your problem with it?

12:17.800 --> 12:18.560
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

12:20.422 --> 12:22.043
[SPEAKER_04]: I just didn't like how intricate it was.

12:22.584 --> 12:22.744
[SPEAKER_04]: The...

12:23.280 --> 12:24.441
[SPEAKER_04]: Control Scheme for it.

12:24.541 --> 12:25.281
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't care for it.

12:25.361 --> 12:27.002
[SPEAKER_04]: I just really didn't get to play it much.

12:28.342 --> 12:31.163
[SPEAKER_04]: The thing was, it didn't really hook me, I guess.

12:31.543 --> 12:34.985
[SPEAKER_04]: I played it for a few minutes, and I was like, eh, I don't really want to give this any more time.

12:36.125 --> 12:37.466
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so I didn't.

12:40.147 --> 12:52.372
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, so there's some interesting news coming out from the company Gearbox, and of course they have done stuff on

12:53.052 --> 13:22.761
[SPEAKER_04]: like the brand new Brothers in Arms series Hell's Highway actually one of the titles that keeps getting pushed back so one thing that they're looking for to for some inspiration is actually the game Portal because most of their games I think in the past have been pretty linear they like the way that Portal kind of the whole story layout and stuff like that so hopefully in the future we'll see some more kind of futuristic games from Gearbox so that's pretty cool

13:23.956 --> 13:25.397
[SPEAKER_06]: Now you're a big fan of Portal, Jamie.

13:25.917 --> 13:26.537
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I am.

13:26.857 --> 13:30.599
[SPEAKER_06]: And do you believe that more games should take inspiration from Portal?

13:32.420 --> 13:33.020
[SPEAKER_01]: I think so.

13:33.100 --> 13:48.707
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, because honestly what they're doing is taking... I actually have to say, because also listening to some of the commentary in the game, I think it was pretty cool that they were taking different concepts in physics and trying to incorporate them into the gameplay in a completely different way.

13:48.847 --> 13:49.567
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, changing...

13:50.646 --> 14:00.014
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of having puzzle here, you don't necessarily think in height and width and depth.

14:00.094 --> 14:05.679
[SPEAKER_01]: You think in terms of manipulating that space to your own ends, and I think that that's pretty cool.

14:06.280 --> 14:12.625
[SPEAKER_01]: And it completely offers a completely different range of freedom, I think, as far as how they can design a game.

14:13.820 --> 14:14.220
[SPEAKER_06]: Very cool.

14:14.280 --> 14:16.101
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to have to listen to that commentary stuff sometime.

14:16.161 --> 14:18.042
[SPEAKER_06]: I think more games should have commentary tracks on it.

14:18.062 --> 14:19.422
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's a pretty interesting idea.

14:19.802 --> 14:22.303
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's hard to have a commentary track in the game.

14:22.343 --> 14:28.085
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the way that Portal kind of did it, where you just kind of go up to something and then kind of play the game from there.

14:28.846 --> 14:35.788
[SPEAKER_01]: It had like a little chat box over it that you could highlight with your gun, and then it would play.

14:36.949 --> 14:40.270
[SPEAKER_01]: And it actually gave you a meter bar so you could see how far through the commentary you were and you could pause it.

14:40.530 --> 14:40.770
[SPEAKER_06]: Huh.

14:41.170 --> 14:41.691
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty cool.

14:42.151 --> 14:42.491
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

14:43.820 --> 14:44.342
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

14:50.911 --> 14:52.852
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a plush companion cube.

14:52.912 --> 14:53.353
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

14:53.453 --> 15:02.079
[SPEAKER_06]: There is officially... Now, you may have seen this, that there was a lot of fan-made, weighted companion cubes being made, and there was a lot of fan stuff.

15:02.399 --> 15:08.883
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Valve actually decided to put their own version out, because I'm sure they're seeing what other people are doing, and they're like, hey, we need to get a piece of that.

15:09.183 --> 15:15.648
[SPEAKER_06]: So they put out official weighted companion cube plushies, and in less than 24 hours, the damn thing sold out.

15:15.708 --> 15:17.269
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how popular these things are.

15:17.529 --> 15:19.229
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually seeing if they still have the fuzzy dice.

15:19.630 --> 15:24.411
[SPEAKER_06]: They went on sale at 4 o'clock on Friday and sold out by noon on Saturday.

15:24.831 --> 15:25.551
[SPEAKER_06]: That's crazy.

15:26.011 --> 15:27.051
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess they'll have to make more.

15:27.511 --> 15:28.412
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want the fuzzy dice.

15:28.652 --> 15:30.132
[SPEAKER_06]: These could be more popular than the Wii.

15:30.912 --> 15:31.812
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want the fuzzy dice.

15:31.932 --> 15:32.713
[SPEAKER_06]: You just want the fuzzy dice?

15:32.913 --> 15:34.213
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you actually going to hang them in your car?

15:34.433 --> 15:37.074
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I will because my Pac-Man dice are highly faded now.

15:37.254 --> 15:37.714
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's too bad.

15:37.734 --> 15:39.354
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, then your waiting companion cubes will fade.

15:39.634 --> 15:41.195
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll burn up just like they do in the game.

15:42.235 --> 15:42.915
[SPEAKER_06]: Spoiler!

15:43.015 --> 15:43.475
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, my bad.

15:44.895 --> 15:45.196
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?

15:45.236 --> 15:46.516
[SPEAKER_01]: Dan was really funny about that part.

15:46.776 --> 15:47.076
[SPEAKER_06]: How so?

15:47.817 --> 15:59.599
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, as what I mentioned to you earlier, Dan's like, yeah, it's very obvious that the character you're playing is female, because they expect you to get all sappy and, you know, all sobby over your weighted companion cube being dead.

15:59.980 --> 16:00.900
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a cube!

16:02.100 --> 16:03.280
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, you don't get it.

16:03.820 --> 16:09.762
[SPEAKER_06]: You can also tell your main character's a woman, because in the very beginning of the game, there's like a mirror, and you see that your character has boobs!

16:10.122 --> 16:10.822
[SPEAKER_06]: OMG boobs!

16:11.122 --> 16:11.642
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, he was...

16:12.651 --> 16:13.071
[SPEAKER_01]: and DarkSakura.

16:41.769 --> 16:44.290
[SPEAKER_06]: TheKingOfPortal11 What the hell is wrong with you people?

16:45.490 --> 16:46.351
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the cocaine.

16:47.011 --> 16:47.251
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently.

16:47.271 --> 16:48.131
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot of cocaine.

16:48.151 --> 16:49.732
[SPEAKER_06]: Have we been giving out cocaine in chat?

16:50.552 --> 16:51.232
[SPEAKER_01]: Share, please.

16:51.732 --> 16:52.292
[SPEAKER_01]: No kidding.

16:55.413 --> 16:58.815
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well, moving on to other gaming news, then.

16:59.915 --> 17:00.495
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't wanna.

17:00.795 --> 17:01.275
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to.

17:01.796 --> 17:03.376
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

17:05.217 --> 17:08.758
[SPEAKER_01]: Lost Odyssey is supposed to...

17:10.737 --> 17:17.801
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually going to be out on Xbox 360 as an exclusive RPG, and it has a release date of February 12th.

17:18.742 --> 17:20.783
[SPEAKER_01]: And downloadable content will be on its way.

17:20.803 --> 17:27.447
[SPEAKER_06]: Aren't I supposed to be able to get downloadable content for free if I pre-order or something?

17:27.887 --> 17:28.868
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought I read something about that.

17:29.588 --> 17:35.272
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually saying that downloadable content will be made exclusive to anyone who pre-orders.

17:35.985 --> 17:43.270
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, so I don't get free download content, I just get to... I get to pay more to have the download content if I pre-order.

17:43.330 --> 17:44.491
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay, that would make more sense.

17:44.551 --> 17:45.671
[SPEAKER_06]: I would hope so.

17:46.432 --> 17:48.173
[SPEAKER_06]: They can use the codes and stuff, right?

17:48.593 --> 17:49.834
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they'll give you codes.

17:49.854 --> 17:52.055
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I would think.

17:53.556 --> 17:55.257
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you've heard much about this game yet.

17:55.438 --> 17:56.918
[SPEAKER_04]: It didn't get very highly...

17:58.386 --> 18:01.127
[SPEAKER_04]: The reviews weren't that great on it in Japan.

18:01.167 --> 18:03.787
[SPEAKER_04]: The trailer looked really good.

18:03.807 --> 18:04.127
[SPEAKER_06]: It did.

18:04.187 --> 18:07.888
[SPEAKER_06]: But then I heard it did not get very well received over in Japan.

18:08.028 --> 18:09.748
[SPEAKER_06]: So that makes me a little less excited about it.

18:10.309 --> 18:14.549
[SPEAKER_04]: What's interesting though, which people might not know, is it's on four DVDs.

18:15.090 --> 18:17.270
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like Blue Dragon was on three.

18:17.650 --> 18:17.970
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

18:19.290 --> 18:20.611
[SPEAKER_04]: Go DVDs!

18:20.671 --> 18:21.131
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay!

18:21.171 --> 18:22.751
[SPEAKER_04]: Can't fit all that space on there.

18:22.771 --> 18:23.871
[SPEAKER_04]: So sad.

18:23.951 --> 18:25.132
[SPEAKER_06]: This game must be epic.

18:25.912 --> 18:26.652
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very epic.

18:27.277 --> 18:31.540
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, sadly enough, I don't know what the game looked like, and that's not really a good point for it.

18:31.880 --> 18:36.563
[SPEAKER_04]: It kind of reminds me a little bit of... Oh, God, what is that game now?

18:36.583 --> 18:39.305
[SPEAKER_04]: I just had the name.

18:39.845 --> 18:41.766
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, you bought it.

18:42.507 --> 18:44.408
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, not Phantasy Star.

18:45.229 --> 18:45.529
[SPEAKER_06]: 99 Nights?

18:45.589 --> 18:46.389
[SPEAKER_04]: Not 99 Nights.

18:47.450 --> 18:48.131
[SPEAKER_04]: Enchanted Arms.

18:48.691 --> 18:49.171
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

18:49.211 --> 18:51.253
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's not a good thing to be compared to.

18:51.733 --> 18:53.954
[SPEAKER_06]: Enchanted Arms wasn't horrible, it just wasn't great.

18:56.296 --> 18:56.556
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

18:57.310 --> 19:00.891
[SPEAKER_04]: Mega Man Battle Network again, yay!

19:25.566 --> 19:26.546
[SPEAKER_06]: How about Mega Man Legends 3?

19:27.067 --> 19:29.207
[SPEAKER_06]: Haven't you guys been hankering for some of that for a while?

19:30.768 --> 19:31.448
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck yeah.

19:32.008 --> 19:33.628
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, they're never going to give that to us.

19:35.069 --> 19:39.830
[SPEAKER_04]: Some theories might be that Mega Man is going to be announced as an official character in Super Smash Bros.

19:39.910 --> 19:45.671
[SPEAKER_04]: Brawl, which I would think that would be covered on the daily updates on their stupid website.

19:45.711 --> 19:48.332
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they would have done it already, if that was true.

19:50.073 --> 19:51.313
[SPEAKER_04]: I was seeing right now

19:52.799 --> 20:02.526
[SPEAKER_04]: If there's any sort of update here, other than, well, Reina just says... I guess, four hours and four minutes?

20:03.227 --> 20:04.488
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't read Japanese, dammit!

20:04.888 --> 20:12.354
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's 0404, so either I got the wrong page... Which is entirely possible.

20:13.375 --> 20:14.756
[SPEAKER_04]: Happy birthday, Rockman.

20:15.296 --> 20:16.317
[SPEAKER_04]: Still looking like a chick.

20:16.957 --> 20:17.157
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

20:18.670 --> 20:24.535
[SPEAKER_06]: Ross Steel UT in response to the whole Mega Man Legends 3.

20:25.315 --> 20:26.716
[SPEAKER_06]: Sky, Capcom can't do that.

20:26.836 --> 20:28.357
[SPEAKER_06]: That'd make Mega Man relevant again.

20:29.919 --> 20:30.639
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess that's true.

20:31.099 --> 20:32.861
[SPEAKER_06]: Jamie made a face at that comment.

20:33.441 --> 20:34.562
[SPEAKER_06]: What was that face about?

20:34.602 --> 20:35.203
[SPEAKER_06]: You made a face.

20:35.383 --> 20:36.243
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just a face.

20:36.824 --> 20:37.104
[SPEAKER_06]: I see.

20:37.604 --> 20:40.086
[SPEAKER_06]: It was an angry face or it was a grr face.

20:40.406 --> 20:42.148
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a face.

20:42.188 --> 20:42.468
[SPEAKER_06]: I see.

20:43.829 --> 20:44.089
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

20:44.930 --> 20:45.130
[SPEAKER_06]: Well,

20:45.845 --> 20:47.946
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I know this news ought to make Jamie happy.

20:48.126 --> 20:50.927
[SPEAKER_06]: This is something that will make Jamie very happy for Christmas.

20:50.967 --> 20:51.428
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't know.

20:51.468 --> 20:51.868
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe not.

20:52.788 --> 20:53.869
[SPEAKER_06]: Christmas nights.

20:54.569 --> 21:00.532
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, Jamie always talks about her annual tradition of putting the Saturn back up and playing some Christmas nights every year.

21:00.832 --> 21:08.596
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, maybe she won't have to anymore because it is going to be included in the PlayStation 2 remake of Nights into Dreams for the PlayStation 2.

21:09.716 --> 21:11.317
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to have Christmas nights as well.

21:11.938 --> 21:15.340
[SPEAKER_06]: The bad news for Jamie, it's a Japan-only release, so she's going to have to pay more money to import it.

21:15.360 --> 21:17.181
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, that's a bad thing at all.

21:17.241 --> 21:18.462
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a Japanese PlayStation 2.

21:18.502 --> 21:21.404
[SPEAKER_04]: I do have to admit, remember they said they weren't really remaking the game?

21:21.784 --> 21:23.425
[SPEAKER_04]: The graphics do look a little bit sharper.

21:24.326 --> 21:27.228
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they probably went back and upgraded some things and cleaned some things up.

21:27.788 --> 21:31.831
[SPEAKER_01]: To also make another point, the Saturn did not have nearly the 3D capability...

21:32.561 --> 21:34.502
[SPEAKER_01]: that the PlayStation did.

21:34.962 --> 21:40.223
[SPEAKER_01]: And so being on the PlayStation 2, one would think that it has a better 3D processor than the Saturn would.

21:40.943 --> 21:43.724
[SPEAKER_01]: So it would have to be cleaner textures and that type of thing.

21:43.764 --> 21:51.726
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but true, but then you also forget the fact that people like to slack off when they port games over and they'll just port them exactly the same for authentic purposes, you know.

21:52.846 --> 22:00.068
[SPEAKER_01]: I think even so, even if it was ported over just the same, it still has better, it'd be better capable of processing it, but.

22:00.549 --> 22:12.815
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, Jamie, it's not going to be as simple, unfortunately, as paying all the money to import the game, because not only are you going to have to do that, but then you have to beat Nights into Dreams, and then you will unlock Christmas Dreams.

22:12.835 --> 22:13.735
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me how that's hard.

22:16.017 --> 22:18.058
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just saying, you've got to put a little bit of work into it.

22:18.618 --> 22:20.699
[SPEAKER_06]: You might have to lift a finger, Jamie, to get to Christmas Dreams.

22:20.719 --> 22:23.680
[SPEAKER_01]: You know the hardest thing about that is going to be playing without getting motion sick.

22:24.701 --> 22:27.302
[SPEAKER_01]: Because Nights is another one of those games that makes me motion sick.

22:28.182 --> 22:28.903
[SPEAKER_01]: I got really sick...

22:29.824 --> 22:30.925
[SPEAKER_01]: I was playing Portal earlier.

22:34.066 --> 22:36.008
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, Portal, write cake, attorney.

22:36.208 --> 22:38.069
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, no more Portal jokes!

22:38.249 --> 22:38.889
[SPEAKER_06]: Jesus!

22:39.069 --> 22:40.150
[SPEAKER_06]: They are still going.

22:40.790 --> 22:41.651
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.

22:42.431 --> 22:43.032
[SPEAKER_01]: Shut up!

22:44.032 --> 22:46.574
[SPEAKER_04]: Portal, write cake, attorney.

22:46.854 --> 22:49.035
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm leaving chat, so I don't have to read any more of that.

22:49.996 --> 22:50.376
[SPEAKER_06]: Lordy.

22:50.776 --> 22:55.119
[SPEAKER_06]: Chatroom, you're banned from commenting on our program for a little bit until you can calm down with the Portal stuff.

22:55.679 --> 22:56.079
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

22:56.459 --> 22:57.240
[SPEAKER_01]: Portal combat.

22:57.260 --> 22:57.840
[SPEAKER_06]: If they can behave...

23:00.100 --> 23:03.901
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, we'll see if they can behave during our next segment, the weekly mailbag segment.

23:04.361 --> 23:10.622
[SPEAKER_06]: Every week you send in your emails to mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com and we pick a few of our favorites to read right here on the air.

23:11.282 --> 23:17.664
[SPEAKER_06]: And Jamie will read them and we'll compliment you or we'll make fun of you or we'll answer your question or we'll sing a song and dance.

23:17.704 --> 23:19.684
[SPEAKER_06]: Who knows, it's unpredictable, it's the mailbag segment.

23:20.704 --> 23:23.025
[SPEAKER_06]: Jamie, open up ye olde mailbag.

23:23.516 --> 23:24.537
[SPEAKER_06]: and tell us what's in it this week.

23:24.777 --> 23:28.639
[SPEAKER_01]: I will be doing neither song nor dance just to make a point of order.

23:28.939 --> 23:31.140
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you'd like to, you can dance to the song playing in the background.

23:31.320 --> 23:32.361
[SPEAKER_06]: Those of you playing along at home.

23:33.282 --> 23:33.782
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you can't.

23:34.402 --> 23:35.403
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll pop my head.

23:36.704 --> 23:37.484
[SPEAKER_01]: First email!

23:39.725 --> 23:42.627
[SPEAKER_01]: From Riz, I guess is how it's pronounced.

23:43.267 --> 23:44.568
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi Rob, Jamie, and Matt.

23:44.908 --> 23:48.910
[SPEAKER_01]: This email was constructed for a number of reasons which are detailed below.

23:49.491 --> 23:52.633
[SPEAKER_01]: I would first like to say what a pleasure listening to your podcast has been.

23:52.753 --> 23:53.233
[SPEAKER_01]: All thank you.

23:53.806 --> 24:01.073
[SPEAKER_01]: I have enjoyed OR since around March and have been greatly entertained by your mix of news, banter, and general chaos.

24:01.613 --> 24:06.638
[SPEAKER_01]: I have been visually impaired since birth, but was able to play a number of video games when I was younger.

24:06.678 --> 24:12.263
[SPEAKER_01]: Due to a deterioration in my eyesight over the years, the number of games I can play is now greatly reduced.

24:12.893 --> 24:13.714
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for watching!

24:34.572 --> 24:41.614
[SPEAKER_06]: I find that most companies and stuff generally don't care if you use video game music and stuff.

24:42.054 --> 24:43.315
[SPEAKER_06]: It's promotion for them.

24:44.295 --> 24:44.955
[SPEAKER_06]: What do they care?

24:45.575 --> 24:52.197
[SPEAKER_06]: And I believe there's some type of fair use law out there or something that as long as you limit it to 30 seconds, you're fine.

24:52.597 --> 24:54.058
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody can really sue you over it.

24:54.358 --> 24:57.659
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, sure, the polite thing to do is ask and all that stuff, but

24:58.086 --> 25:04.788
[SPEAKER_06]: I think as long as you use, especially the old stuff, the old 8-bit stuff, which I know a lot of podcasts use for their openings and things, nobody's really going to care.

25:05.228 --> 25:05.808
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's fine.

25:06.768 --> 25:08.329
[SPEAKER_01]: Next email.

25:09.729 --> 25:13.570
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to thank Sky, DarkSakura, and Loki for hosting the best gaming podcast on the internet.

25:14.250 --> 25:16.791
[SPEAKER_01]: I just started listening a couple weeks ago and already I'm hooked.

25:17.271 --> 25:20.091
[SPEAKER_01]: I've already been scouring the internet for all the episodes I can download.

25:20.131 --> 25:21.472
[SPEAKER_01]: I listen to them on my PSP.

25:21.772 --> 25:22.072
[SPEAKER_01]: See?

25:22.785 --> 25:23.765
[SPEAKER_01]: More PSP listeners.

25:23.886 --> 25:25.406
[SPEAKER_06]: I said in Part A there were some.

25:25.546 --> 25:26.167
[SPEAKER_06]: They do exist.

25:26.247 --> 25:28.468
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's no better place for gaming news and humor.

25:28.668 --> 25:29.488
[SPEAKER_01]: One quick question, though.

25:29.608 --> 25:31.749
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there anywhere I can download previous episodes?

25:32.169 --> 25:36.351
[SPEAKER_01]: The RSS feed only goes back a few episodes, and there's about 250 more I can't find.

25:37.211 --> 25:39.572
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks and screw Rockman for sucking so much online.

25:39.712 --> 25:40.153
[SPEAKER_01]: PKJr92

25:41.913 --> 25:50.081
[SPEAKER_06]: If you go to olrpsp.com, the parser over there actually goes back a few more episodes, which if you're listening on your PSP, you've probably already done.

25:50.121 --> 25:52.283
[SPEAKER_06]: You can go back about 20 episodes there.

25:53.384 --> 26:01.671
[SPEAKER_06]: Otherwise, we keep – I think some of the websites like Yahoo Podcasts, I want to say, and –

26:03.382 --> 26:04.163
[SPEAKER_01]: What about iTunes?

26:04.243 --> 26:05.324
[SPEAKER_06]: Podcast Alley.

26:06.545 --> 26:10.950
[SPEAKER_06]: The one on iTunes only goes back ten listings, which is about five episodes.

26:10.990 --> 26:20.659
[SPEAKER_06]: And the reason for that is to prevent what happened a few years ago to some podcasts is that this new application came out for the Xbox 360 called XB Stream.

26:20.679 --> 26:23.442
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's a great idea and a great application.

26:23.502 --> 26:26.365
[SPEAKER_06]: We're actually a default podcast that's on it when you put this thing in.

26:26.735 --> 26:39.583
[SPEAKER_06]: But for the default podcast that were on the very first version of it, what happened is that the program downloaded every single program from the feed, which for people that never cleaned up their feeds meant their server was getting hammered for like 100 downloads of big shows at once.

26:40.143 --> 26:47.108
[SPEAKER_06]: So we keep our feed tidy for that reason, so that if you use a grabber that does something like that where it gets all episodes of a show, you're limited to 10.

26:47.768 --> 26:48.649
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty much the reason we do it.

26:48.929 --> 26:51.790
[SPEAKER_06]: We only do server cleans about once every few months when we need the space.

26:51.931 --> 26:54.212
[SPEAKER_06]: Otherwise, if you want to find shows older than that,

26:54.682 --> 26:56.423
[SPEAKER_06]: Ask around the community, post on the forums.

26:56.623 --> 27:02.285
[SPEAKER_06]: I know there's one person out there that probably has every pre-podcast show we ever did.

27:02.305 --> 27:04.146
[SPEAKER_06]: I know there's at least one person out there that has that.

27:04.166 --> 27:06.367
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even have that, to put it in perspective.

27:06.407 --> 27:07.667
[SPEAKER_01]: I've asked and haven't heard anything.

27:08.267 --> 27:15.610
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a lot, and we might put out some DVDs out there, but we can't do any big releases of it just because of some of the things.

27:15.931 --> 27:21.073
[SPEAKER_06]: We might have to do something kind of like under the table for the fans only because there was some copyright music, so we can't really sell it for profit.

27:21.953 --> 27:24.434
[SPEAKER_06]: But anything's a possibility in the near future, so we'll see.

27:25.411 --> 27:28.013
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also a funny quote on here from Loki.

27:28.213 --> 27:28.473
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

27:28.953 --> 27:30.574
[SPEAKER_01]: Friendship is like peeing on yourself.

27:30.695 --> 27:33.096
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone can see it, but only you get the warm feeling it brings.

27:34.937 --> 27:35.297
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

27:37.078 --> 27:37.279
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

27:39.240 --> 27:39.840
[SPEAKER_01]: To Skye.

27:40.941 --> 27:45.524
[SPEAKER_01]: I was wondering why every time G4 is brought up on the show, you moan and groan about how much you hate it.

27:46.424 --> 27:47.185
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate G4.

27:47.205 --> 27:47.745
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate G4.

27:50.262 --> 27:51.883
[SPEAKER_01]: It isn't that bad in my opinion.

27:51.943 --> 27:57.407
[SPEAKER_01]: The shows, such as Attack of the Show being my favorite, X-Play, Cheat, and Ninja Warrior are all awesome.

27:57.487 --> 28:04.732
[SPEAKER_01]: I can understand that a lot of people wish that it were more like it used to be when it was tech TV, but had a more gaming-oriented atmosphere to it.

28:04.953 --> 28:09.316
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell, I'm pissed that they took off icons and replaced it with crap like cheaters and cops.

28:09.736 --> 28:11.257
[SPEAKER_01]: But you shouldn't hate G4 completely.

28:11.317 --> 28:12.538
[SPEAKER_01]: It still has some great shows on it.

28:12.618 --> 28:13.299
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Osfer.

28:13.919 --> 28:14.219
[SPEAKER_01]: P.S.

28:14.259 --> 28:16.721
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you guys seen the Zero Punctuation gaming reviews?

28:16.801 --> 28:17.582
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a link to the site.

28:17.742 --> 28:19.243
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I have to see this.

28:20.149 --> 28:22.030
[SPEAKER_06]: That's some funny shit if you watch it every week.

28:42.558 --> 28:45.980
[SPEAKER_06]: It's nothing like it could have been with the whole tech TV merge and stuff.

28:46.020 --> 28:48.362
[SPEAKER_06]: And it just got too corporate and yucky.

28:48.402 --> 28:50.323
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's owned by E for God's sakes.

28:50.443 --> 28:51.364
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I don't know.

28:51.444 --> 28:57.148
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just everything that's kind of disturbing about corporate media is kind of like embodied in G4.

28:57.188 --> 28:58.789
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's why I just don't like it.

29:00.630 --> 29:02.071
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm allowed not to like things.

29:05.934 --> 29:06.374
[SPEAKER_01]: Next email.

29:07.154 --> 29:07.555
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, guys.

29:07.715 --> 29:07.875
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

29:08.672 --> 29:14.076
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you don't normally read FUs from listeners, but I was in a car accident yesterday, and I really wanted to vent somewhere.

29:14.477 --> 29:14.817
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not?

29:15.578 --> 29:23.584
[SPEAKER_01]: To the woman in the Jeep who tried to pass me by going onto the oncoming traffic while I was making a U-turn, a big fat FU.

29:24.044 --> 29:28.208
[SPEAKER_01]: This is on my last day of finals, and I was just about to go home from Davis, and I am pissed off.

29:28.688 --> 29:32.091
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to have to agree with Loki that women drivers in this area can't drive for anything.

29:32.191 --> 29:32.832
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks at me.

29:32.852 --> 29:34.353
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be me.

29:35.199 --> 29:38.621
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, everyone is okay, although my head slammed into the car door during the impact.

29:39.181 --> 29:44.124
[SPEAKER_01]: The only part of this is that since I won't have a car for a while, I'll be able to sit at home and play all the games I want over the break.

29:44.665 --> 29:52.209
[SPEAKER_01]: That being the case, what are your favorite games that came out this holiday season on any console, since I guess I'll be looking for something to pass the time.

29:52.730 --> 29:54.991
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep up the awesome show, I need something to keep my spirits up.

29:55.011 --> 29:56.732
[SPEAKER_01]: What an awesome way to start the holidays.

29:57.352 --> 29:58.453
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy Holidays, AZHP.

29:59.674 --> 29:59.874
[SPEAKER_06]: Portal!

29:59.894 --> 30:00.034
[SPEAKER_06]: Portal!

30:01.630 --> 30:05.886
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to give it all away because then I'd be basically giving you my favorite games of the year.

30:07.373 --> 30:08.534
[SPEAKER_06]: I will back up what Jamie said.

30:08.574 --> 30:13.056
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Orange Box in general is a very good investment.

30:13.196 --> 30:13.956
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's a thought though.

30:14.477 --> 30:16.638
[SPEAKER_06]: Use this period, this opportunity.

30:16.658 --> 30:19.719
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad you have such a positive attitude about it because it really sucks what happened.

30:20.039 --> 30:21.460
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad you have a good attitude about it.

30:21.900 --> 30:25.862
[SPEAKER_06]: Instead of necessarily having to play everything new that comes out, go back and play the shit you missed.

30:26.202 --> 30:30.124
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I bet there's a lot of stuff that you missed towards the end of last year amongst all the cons of madness.

30:30.164 --> 30:31.344
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll give you a great example for me.

30:31.364 --> 30:31.705
[SPEAKER_06]: Final Fantasy XII.

30:32.945 --> 30:41.188
[SPEAKER_06]: I did not get nearly as far in that game as I would have liked to because it was an amazing battle system in the game and I just never really got a chance to just play it the whole way through to completion.

30:41.228 --> 30:44.070
[SPEAKER_06]: That's one of those games I would like to complete one day when there's time.

30:44.130 --> 30:50.492
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would encourage you to actually take this opportunity to go revisit the past games and beat stuff you haven't yet that you wanted to.

30:50.772 --> 30:58.996
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go to Deliverance online and download Ragnarok online and play on the server with me and Ranma and join the OLR guild on there.

30:59.156 --> 30:59.596
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, there you go.

30:59.616 --> 31:00.476
[SPEAKER_06]: Join an MMO.

31:00.496 --> 31:01.597
[SPEAKER_06]: That'll suck up all your time.

31:02.017 --> 31:02.497
[SPEAKER_06]: There you have it.

31:04.338 --> 31:08.160
[SPEAKER_06]: The ACHP is actually in chat right now and says, I just finished 12 during finals week.

31:09.081 --> 31:09.361
[SPEAKER_06]: LOL.

31:10.201 --> 31:12.943
[SPEAKER_06]: How did you have time to beat a Final Fantasy game during finals?

31:13.443 --> 31:14.684
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you taking, like, home ec?

31:15.044 --> 31:15.705
[SPEAKER_06]: What is up with that?

31:15.745 --> 31:16.505
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, that's amazing.

31:16.805 --> 31:17.886
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, hey, hey, Rob.

31:17.986 --> 31:18.386
[SPEAKER_06]: What, what?

31:19.127 --> 31:23.449
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually, one of my finals weeks, I stayed up for three days and played D&D every night.

31:23.589 --> 31:24.210
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, my God.

31:24.530 --> 31:25.210
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys are crazy.

31:25.250 --> 31:26.551
[SPEAKER_01]: I passed out on the fourth day.

31:26.651 --> 31:28.912
[SPEAKER_01]: I was kept alive by Jolt Cola and Pixie Stix.

31:29.112 --> 31:31.514
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, any recommendations for our listener who's...

31:33.556 --> 31:36.637
[SPEAKER_06]: Handicapped for Winter Break for games to play while they're on Winter Break?

31:38.738 --> 31:42.060
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Call of Duty 4 is pretty good, I guess.

31:42.280 --> 31:43.280
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, actually it is.

31:44.001 --> 31:47.882
[SPEAKER_04]: Halo 3, Super Mario Galaxy.

31:50.423 --> 31:52.324
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, you can play a ton of stuff.

31:52.344 --> 31:53.325
[SPEAKER_04]: There's tons of games out there.

31:53.945 --> 31:55.746
[SPEAKER_04]: Just play something you haven't played yet.

31:56.646 --> 31:57.066
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

31:57.347 --> 31:58.407
[SPEAKER_04]: RPGs, there you go.

31:58.427 --> 31:59.948
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll bring you a Nintendo.

32:01.107 --> 32:02.527
[SPEAKER_01]: and you can play classic stuff.

32:02.547 --> 32:03.528
[SPEAKER_01]: You can play Guardian Legend.

32:03.628 --> 32:03.928
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

32:04.088 --> 32:06.948
[SPEAKER_06]: Go back and play every Saturn game you didn't play previously.

32:07.328 --> 32:09.249
[SPEAKER_01]: Dear God, I don't have enough room for that.

32:10.289 --> 32:10.789
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, anyhow.

32:10.849 --> 32:12.249
[SPEAKER_01]: I know what you should do.

32:12.369 --> 32:13.850
[SPEAKER_01]: Find me a copy of Burning Rangers.

32:14.750 --> 32:16.310
[SPEAKER_06]: Next email, please.

32:17.110 --> 32:19.851
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, Merry early Christmas slash happy holidays.

32:19.891 --> 32:28.433
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if you're doing an episode for the 23rd and I don't think I can listen live on the 16th which as of this writing is today since I have a final exam the next day.

32:28.653 --> 32:29.633
[SPEAKER_01]: Oops, good luck on that.

32:30.353 --> 32:31.695
[SPEAKER_01]: This is from GS68, by the way.

32:33.077 --> 32:35.440
[SPEAKER_06]: Who happens to be in chat, by the way, so I guess he found a way.

32:35.520 --> 32:35.741
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

32:39.634 --> 32:40.855
[SPEAKER_01]: Me regarding fellow gamers.

32:41.295 --> 32:55.781
[SPEAKER_01]: On sites like GamePolitics, Facebook, and especially GameSpy, there are gamers who are quick to get angry and defensive about their games whenever Dr. Phil, whose comment on game usage, not games, being a problem was, in my opinion, a step in the right direction.

32:56.361 --> 33:01.603
[SPEAKER_01]: Although many people who commented on the story just saw the name Dr. Phil and immediately thought, oh my god, it's Dr. Phil, he sucks horse.

33:02.624 --> 33:02.704
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh...

33:03.465 --> 33:06.407
[SPEAKER_01]: JT censorship, and school shootings show up.

33:06.907 --> 33:14.371
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I see comments along the lines of, I hope JT gets his ass kicked so hard he goes sterile, and worse, maybe Microsoft will hire a drifter and kill him.

33:16.172 --> 33:23.435
[SPEAKER_01]: It's rather ironic that there are gamers who oppose the idea that video games make people violent-minded and then go on wishing death upon Jackie Poo.

33:24.056 --> 33:27.577
[SPEAKER_01]: I dislike JT as much as the next gamer, especially his reaction to gamers' email.

33:27.918 --> 33:30.539
[SPEAKER_01]: The Flowers for Jack project and its outcome are a prime example.

33:31.107 --> 33:32.489
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

33:52.350 --> 33:56.673
[SPEAKER_01]: Those kinds of personal attacks make us gamers look bad in front of people supportive of video game censorship.

33:57.153 --> 34:10.523
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we need to get sent to Bullworth Academy, no, as if we need to get sent to Bullworth Academy, is this kind of defensiveness and immaturity that also led to the creation of the otaku stereotype.

34:10.963 --> 34:14.926
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm a gamer and an anime slash manga fan, so facepalm.

34:16.658 --> 34:20.741
[SPEAKER_01]: and with all of that said, I wish the three of you and any guests also in the studio a great holiday.

34:20.822 --> 34:21.902
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't die in a car fire.

34:22.343 --> 34:23.744
[SPEAKER_01]: Yours truly, GS68.

34:23.784 --> 34:24.765
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll try, thanks.

34:25.145 --> 34:25.566
[SPEAKER_01]: P.S.

34:25.726 --> 34:28.088
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you three going to SAC Anime this January?

34:28.448 --> 34:32.692
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hoping to go and it would be great to see you guys there since I didn't get a chance to go to last summer's SAC Anime.

34:34.353 --> 34:36.194
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh God, I didn't realize there was one in January too.

34:36.275 --> 34:36.775
[SPEAKER_01]: I forgot about it.

34:36.795 --> 34:37.516
[SPEAKER_01]: We should try to do a panel.

34:37.676 --> 34:39.357
[SPEAKER_06]: I gotta get in touch with Jonas about that.

34:39.657 --> 34:40.258
[SPEAKER_06]: We're gonna try and go.

34:42.214 --> 34:43.394
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not at 8 in the morning.

34:43.414 --> 34:45.136
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not going again if our panel's at 8 in the morning.

34:45.156 --> 34:46.317
[SPEAKER_06]: But if we can get something better, we'll go.

34:46.497 --> 34:50.680
[SPEAKER_01]: I probably won't cosplay unless it's my Organization 13 costume.

34:53.242 --> 34:54.683
[SPEAKER_01]: Last email.

34:55.284 --> 34:56.285
[SPEAKER_01]: From Cheeseburger.

34:57.806 --> 34:59.047
[SPEAKER_01]: Who signed it with a question mark.

34:59.407 --> 35:00.248
[SPEAKER_06]: I can ask Cheeseburger?

35:01.108 --> 35:01.809
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Cheeseburger.

35:02.609 --> 35:03.530
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, OLR crew.

35:03.750 --> 35:08.094
[SPEAKER_01]: I have been listening to your podcast for almost a year and a half now, and I think it's great.

35:08.454 --> 35:09.195
[SPEAKER_01]: You're still with us?

35:09.255 --> 35:09.455
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.

35:10.416 --> 35:13.078
[SPEAKER_01]: I have also listened live and interacted in chat a few times too.

35:13.118 --> 35:19.482
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason for this email is to ask Rob about Civilization 3, which I purchased for my new computer on his recommendation.

35:19.862 --> 35:21.503
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your perspective on that game?

35:22.043 --> 35:27.026
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also chose Russia because I thought I could make nuclear weapons and blow everything up.

35:27.587 --> 35:30.188
[SPEAKER_01]: The only other PC games I have are StarCraft and Black and White 2.

35:31.029 --> 35:35.952
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, Loki's comment about having a washer and dryer so he could now piss himself with joy was hilarious.

35:36.593 --> 35:40.016
[SPEAKER_01]: Another email comment, Olive Garden Home of the Neverending Salads was funny too.

35:40.637 --> 35:40.917
[SPEAKER_01]: P.S.

35:41.057 --> 35:43.840
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Rob is rad and Kmart sucks lols.

35:44.981 --> 35:46.222
[SPEAKER_06]: I think cheeseburgers are rad.

35:46.741 --> 35:47.962
[SPEAKER_01]: I like cheeseburgers in paradise.

36:12.611 --> 36:14.552
[SPEAKER_06]: But, of course, there are multiple ways to win the game.

36:14.792 --> 36:19.935
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you get the most points for being the first person in space, but that's not nearly as fun as Global Dominantization.

36:20.636 --> 36:27.079
[SPEAKER_06]: My favorite thing to do in Civilization is I like to treat everybody really nice, and, you know, I'm like, oh, sure, we'll trade with you.

36:27.139 --> 36:28.480
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's sign a peace treaty.

36:28.900 --> 36:29.701
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, we love you.

36:30.141 --> 36:36.725
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I will, you know, take a bunch of army units, like, right outside their city, and then I'll, you know, nuke the shit out of them.

36:37.125 --> 36:38.246
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually got one last email.

36:38.566 --> 36:38.966
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, goody.

36:39.146 --> 36:41.868
[SPEAKER_01]: That we got last minute, and I'm going to read it, and

36:42.778 --> 36:47.961
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not signed, so I'm just going to say it's from G. Davis, I guess.

36:48.061 --> 36:48.302
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

36:49.062 --> 36:49.822
[SPEAKER_01]: LOLR.

36:50.143 --> 36:56.547
[SPEAKER_01]: After listening to your guys' and Jamie's thoughts on DDR on last week's show, I cannot help but feel like I need to say I completely agree.

36:57.167 --> 36:59.488
[SPEAKER_01]: DDR hasn't changed drastically since 6th Mix.

36:59.909 --> 37:04.091
[SPEAKER_01]: However, 7th Mix is my favorite mix and will always be Smile Face.

37:04.151 --> 37:09.114
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing that made DDR so much fun to play was the cheesy Dance Mania pop that was in it.

37:11.204 --> 37:19.752
[SPEAKER_01]: After seeing the list of licensed songs in the arcade version of Supernova 2, I have to say that I am not excited for it because a lot of it is shitty mainstream music.

37:20.093 --> 37:22.295
[SPEAKER_01]: Linkin Park and DDR equals WTF.

37:23.276 --> 37:25.358
[SPEAKER_01]: The same goes for the home versions.

37:25.698 --> 37:30.423
[SPEAKER_01]: Most casual gamers end up thinking Guitar Hero is the best rhythm game because it has real songs in it, in quotes.

37:31.297 --> 37:38.743
[SPEAKER_01]: and when they heard that the home version of Supernova 2 had Britney Spears, Gwen Stefani and Justin Timberlake, they said Guitar Hero had good real music.

37:39.144 --> 37:44.208
[SPEAKER_01]: However, they also said that Captain Jack, Cartoon Heroes and most of the other Dance Mania tracks were some of their favorite songs in DDR.

37:44.769 --> 37:48.512
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think this crappy mainstream pop is appealing to anyone except for 12-year-old girls.

37:49.421 --> 37:51.903
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, Rob, what innovations would you put in DDR?

37:51.943 --> 37:54.145
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I've always been curious as to what they are.

37:54.605 --> 37:59.129
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my favorite things about DDR is the sheer simplicity of it, so anybody could jump in and play.

37:59.249 --> 38:01.731
[SPEAKER_01]: I think too many changes might ruin that part of DDR.

38:03.133 --> 38:06.576
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I've said this a million times on the show, but I know you might be a newer listener or what have you.

38:06.596 --> 38:08.757
[SPEAKER_06]: We've been doing the show a long time, so it feels like a million.

38:08.777 --> 38:10.659
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think the best way they could innovate DDR...

38:11.212 --> 38:14.894
[SPEAKER_06]: is that right now the way DDR is, it has a lot of cooperative modes in the game.

38:15.475 --> 38:21.098
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of cooperative dancing, a lot of cooperative... I think the way for DDR to innovate is to make it more of a competitive game.

38:21.379 --> 38:23.960
[SPEAKER_06]: And that way tournaments can be based more around the competition element.

38:24.000 --> 38:31.525
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, yes, I understand there's Dance Magic in DDR Disney, and I believe there was a mode similar to it in some of the later home versions that they did for DDR.

38:31.585 --> 38:37.369
[SPEAKER_06]: However, these versions have always been like add-ons or tack-ons and not the focus of the game itself.

38:37.850 --> 38:43.832
[SPEAKER_06]: and I think there ought to be some type of like dance battle or something that the game could kind of focus on.

38:44.892 --> 38:47.333
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, kind of taking some ideas and innovating from that.

38:47.513 --> 38:51.074
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that maybe even in one player mode you do battle against the computer.

38:51.395 --> 38:58.037
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's how games like Busta Groove worked is that, you know, you were always kind of battling somebody else to see who was the better dancer.

38:58.317 --> 38:59.557
[SPEAKER_01]: And they did it better in the second one.

38:59.717 --> 39:07.380
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and I think that could be a new direction for DDR where they could innovate yet keep the core element of the game stomping on arrows the same.

39:07.700 --> 39:09.021
[SPEAKER_01]: Second Mix had it.

39:10.202 --> 39:10.682
[SPEAKER_01]: Dance Battle.

39:25.034 --> 39:30.436
[SPEAKER_06]: Having some of the mainstream stuff is nice, but I think, you know, the Dance Mania stuff is always where it was at.

39:30.456 --> 39:31.317
[SPEAKER_06]: And a different drum, too.

39:31.397 --> 39:31.937
[SPEAKER_06]: Can't forget them.

39:32.317 --> 39:36.899
[SPEAKER_06]: But, boy, I really ruffled some feathers in my comments last week, though, from some of the hardcore DDR people.

39:36.979 --> 39:38.039
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen a few comments.

39:39.060 --> 39:40.981
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, I stand by what I said.

39:41.021 --> 39:45.202
[SPEAKER_06]: I know it's tough to hear, but... Super DDR Fighter 2 Turbo.

39:46.083 --> 39:49.964
[SPEAKER_06]: It's time for DDR to innovate or... Eliminate?

39:50.004 --> 39:50.484
[SPEAKER_06]: Go away.

39:50.764 --> 39:51.865
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate to say that, but...

39:52.691 --> 39:54.092
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

40:18.365 --> 40:28.730
[SPEAKER_04]: You will be able to send virtual console games to friends on your friends list, barring that you have their Wii friend code.

40:29.511 --> 40:32.932
[SPEAKER_04]: But you can gift wonderful virtual console games.

40:33.453 --> 40:40.736
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm sure once Guardian Legend comes out, you'll have 30 copies of Guardian Legend coming to you from all your friends.

40:40.916 --> 40:42.177
[SPEAKER_06]: I have no problem with this.

40:44.574 --> 40:46.475
[SPEAKER_04]: No word, though, and I haven't heard about this before.

40:46.515 --> 40:48.115
[SPEAKER_04]: What happens if you already have the game?

40:48.496 --> 40:49.456
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess you're just out of luck.

40:50.857 --> 40:51.277
[SPEAKER_06]: Perhaps.

40:51.677 --> 40:52.057
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

40:52.657 --> 41:02.681
[SPEAKER_06]: Or, well... No, I want to say I have heard that what happens if you already have the game is that you actually can't send the game to your friend.

41:02.962 --> 41:06.983
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, when you try to gift it to them, it'll just bounce back and say you can't gift this because they already have it.

41:07.383 --> 41:08.284
[SPEAKER_06]: Or something along those lines.

41:08.304 --> 41:09.144
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's kind of cool, then.

41:09.624 --> 41:09.884
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

41:11.065 --> 41:13.686
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't guarantee that, though, but I'm pretty sure that's what I read.

41:14.179 --> 41:15.180
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

41:42.183 --> 41:45.405
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're feeling cheap this Christmas, gift free things to your friends.

41:46.206 --> 41:46.586
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fun.

41:49.208 --> 41:49.869
[SPEAKER_01]: I like free.

41:50.869 --> 41:52.731
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you want to watch the Metroid Channel.

41:53.531 --> 41:54.372
[SPEAKER_01]: The Metroid Channel.

41:55.693 --> 41:58.115
[SPEAKER_06]: I would watch the Metroid Channel if that were a real TV channel.

41:59.196 --> 42:05.140
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there is a little bit of news for people who like stuff on their iPhone.

42:07.422 --> 42:09.084
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that like stuff on my cat?

42:09.524 --> 42:09.604
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

42:11.201 --> 42:12.902
[SPEAKER_01]: It's as in emulation.

42:13.342 --> 42:19.024
[SPEAKER_01]: They are in the beta stage, well, near the beta stage, I should say, for an iPhone PS1 emulator.

42:19.965 --> 42:26.888
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's called PSX for number four iPhone emulator.

42:27.348 --> 42:33.471
[SPEAKER_01]: They're still working on it, but hopefully they'll have something out soon for all of you who want to do it.

42:33.491 --> 42:39.754
[SPEAKER_01]: But they say that their goal is to have it 75% compatible with all of the...

42:42.037 --> 42:45.599
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd have to say it's compatible with 75% of the list of PS1 games that are out.

42:48.100 --> 42:49.781
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, that'd be nice, but you know what?

42:49.981 --> 42:52.983
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to download it unless something that Apple puts out.

42:53.984 --> 42:57.926
[SPEAKER_06]: Rosto UT in chat says, unless you can plug a controller in the iPhone, do not want...

42:59.213 --> 43:18.989
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking at the screen for this that they have on here, and I'll go ahead and link that in the chat room, they've got D-pads and your trigger buttons on the screen itself sort of running behind the game stuff itself.

43:19.069 --> 43:22.232
[SPEAKER_01]: So that still doesn't... I don't think it's going to work.

43:22.932 --> 43:25.514
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't think that it'll be very playable.

43:26.595 --> 43:27.856
[SPEAKER_01]: The Nintendo one, I understand.

43:27.916 --> 43:28.677
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually was okay.

43:29.318 --> 43:30.219
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo one looks rad.

43:30.239 --> 43:35.183
[SPEAKER_06]: If I had an iPhone, I'd do it, except for the fact that, you know, then Apple will put the curse of death on my phone, probably.

43:35.203 --> 43:36.304
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't want to brick my phone.

43:36.384 --> 43:37.085
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, exactly.

43:37.105 --> 43:39.247
[SPEAKER_04]: You already have the curse of death if you have an iPhone anyway.

43:39.547 --> 43:40.067
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut up.

43:40.708 --> 43:42.069
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't had a single problem with mine.

43:43.991 --> 43:44.531
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, shiz.

43:44.651 --> 43:45.532
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, more news.

43:45.992 --> 43:47.834
[SPEAKER_06]: Less Apple debate, more news.

43:49.736 --> 43:52.318
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, let's see here.

43:54.259 --> 44:01.564
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, there's gonna be some new maps, apparently, for Team Fortress 2 coming, as well as some more fixes, uh, cause you can't fix that game enough.

44:02.364 --> 44:06.587
[SPEAKER_04]: But, um, that's kinda cool that they're having new maps, cause I remember before, they only had, like, what, three maps?

44:06.887 --> 44:07.528
[SPEAKER_04]: So that kinda sucks.

44:08.128 --> 44:23.458
[SPEAKER_04]: But now, um, let's see here, they're talking about some different, uh, fixes that they're gonna be having, including several gameplay exploits, plus other stuff to improve, uh, bandwidth usage, and, um, improve stats reporting, and I guess some menu bugs.

44:24.904 --> 44:27.865
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't really say, though, what the different levels are going to be yet.

44:29.146 --> 44:32.307
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm sure we'll find that out soon, because I don't think it's officially been announced.

44:34.588 --> 44:36.588
[SPEAKER_06]: What are you freaking out about over there, DarkSakura?

44:37.389 --> 44:41.510
[SPEAKER_01]: I was looking at Valve's website, and they have Aperture Science cups.

44:42.111 --> 44:42.771
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do want one.

44:46.452 --> 44:51.114
[SPEAKER_06]: It's funny, because all the passion she had for DDR at one time, she now has for Portal.

44:51.154 --> 44:51.734
[SPEAKER_06]: It's amazing.

44:52.034 --> 44:53.715
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what would be fucking awesome?

44:53.775 --> 44:54.015
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

44:54.597 --> 44:59.322
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know how they have those stupid little, um, you know, light-censored things?

44:59.762 --> 45:03.847
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like the stupid frogs and stuff that you walk in front of and they rib it at you and stuff?

45:04.167 --> 45:08.631
[SPEAKER_04]: They need one of those sentry guns or whatever, so when you walk past it's all, Hello!

45:09.372 --> 45:10.233
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's there?

45:11.214 --> 45:15.819
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and do all that stuff and pop up and... We need to make that happen.

45:16.119 --> 45:16.840
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be pretty sweet.

45:17.105 --> 45:17.766
[SPEAKER_06]: W00T is the word of the year

45:41.004 --> 45:42.725
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think I need to define what Woot means.

45:42.805 --> 45:45.207
[SPEAKER_06]: Most gamers know Woot is like a celebration thing.

45:45.227 --> 45:48.749
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm just thinking, I always think about Woot.com too, the store.

45:49.049 --> 45:49.529
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what they have?

45:49.569 --> 45:53.111
[SPEAKER_06]: This is going to be great business for them to be the guy that owns Woot.com right now.

45:53.692 --> 45:57.194
[SPEAKER_06]: The runner up, by the way, was Facebook, but using it as a verb.

45:57.254 --> 45:58.635
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you're going to Facebook somebody.

45:59.155 --> 46:03.438
[SPEAKER_06]: But I always thought saying you were going to MySpace somebody was a more popular verb to use.

46:03.738 --> 46:04.979
[SPEAKER_01]: I just say friend somebody.

46:05.279 --> 46:05.519
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

46:05.539 --> 46:07.720
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think that's a good thing to say.

46:08.421 --> 46:08.521
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

46:09.485 --> 46:11.106
[SPEAKER_01]: Turn a noun into a verb.

46:36.981 --> 46:38.863
[SPEAKER_04]: We're totally independent, but we're owned by Sony.

46:39.363 --> 46:44.607
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently, LittleBigPlanet and Killzone 2 are not coming out until September or October next year.

46:45.128 --> 46:49.872
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a pretty big difference from early 2008, which was the original time for LittleBigPlanet.

46:50.132 --> 46:54.635
[SPEAKER_06]: But then again, pushback should be no new news to Sony, or really gaming in general.

46:54.656 --> 46:56.517
[SPEAKER_06]: It wouldn't be fair to pick on Sony in that department.

46:56.817 --> 46:58.639
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, Super Smash Bros.

46:58.699 --> 47:00.200
[SPEAKER_06]: Brawl, right?

47:01.921 --> 47:06.205
[SPEAKER_06]: But it just kind of sucks for sales because, again, without really, really killer applications...

47:07.861 --> 47:10.523
[SPEAKER_06]: PlayStation 3's aren't going to move off-shells any faster.

47:11.063 --> 47:32.596
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, no, all the stuff that they're promising us, you know, that was supposed to be coming out so people would buy these systems, you know, I'm sure you've seen the trailers for, like, the third-party stuff that they have for PlayStation 3 now, where they're advertising Metal Gear Solid 4, like, it's out right now, even though it doesn't come out until, what, like, shit, I don't even know, they haven't officially announced it yet, probably, like, March-ish, so...

47:33.332 --> 47:35.273
[SPEAKER_06]: Quick clarifications from our chat room.

47:35.613 --> 47:40.616
[SPEAKER_06]: Ross Steel UT says three speeches, Sony Europe, Sony USA is PlayStation.blog.

47:41.997 --> 47:42.437
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, fine.

47:43.638 --> 47:45.218
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's still Sony, no matter what country you're in.

47:45.238 --> 47:46.338
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if that's the case, then who knows?

47:46.358 --> 47:51.659
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, LittleBigPlanet and Killzone being delayed to, like, the fall, you know, Europe's always getting the shaft.

47:51.699 --> 47:57.640
[SPEAKER_06]: That's true, Europe always gets the shaft in that department, but I don't know, even... That's a long shaft.

47:57.720 --> 48:01.501
[SPEAKER_06]: If they're not getting them until the end of the year, and we're getting them at the beginning of the year.

48:01.621 --> 48:02.801
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, here's the thing I want to know.

48:03.181 --> 48:06.562
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure if SingStar is already out now in Europe.

48:06.602 --> 48:09.142
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it's not here for the PlayStation 3, at least.

48:09.362 --> 48:12.863
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe they're just having trouble with, like, their network infrastructure or something like that, because...

48:14.038 --> 48:23.669
[SPEAKER_04]: Home, SingStar, this little big planet that's going to have a lot of network backend stuff is not coming out.

48:24.190 --> 48:27.794
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it sad that I kind of sort of want a PlayStation 3 for SingStar?

48:28.956 --> 48:32.737
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it is sad, seeing as there's countless versions for the PlayStation 2.

48:33.377 --> 48:34.897
[SPEAKER_04]: Why the fuck do you need the PlayStation 3 version?

48:34.917 --> 48:36.598
[SPEAKER_06]: Because of the whole, like, I know my friends.

48:36.618 --> 48:38.218
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, because you can upload videos to YouTube.

48:38.238 --> 48:39.318
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, and I want to do that to my friends.

48:39.338 --> 48:42.899
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, because we never upload videos to any other site.

48:43.099 --> 48:44.700
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like uploading videos to YouTube.

48:44.840 --> 48:45.500
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, how about this?

48:45.740 --> 48:48.421
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't you actually upload videos to YouTube?

48:48.681 --> 48:49.061
[SPEAKER_04]: Guess what?

48:49.121 --> 48:50.341
[SPEAKER_04]: It's free to do that.

48:51.081 --> 48:52.642
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead of having to buy a game.

48:52.862 --> 48:53.922
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, fine, shut up.

48:56.269 --> 48:58.770
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't you buy, you know, fucking SingStar right now?

48:58.810 --> 49:00.411
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, hell, you get the microphones.

49:00.431 --> 49:01.652
[SPEAKER_04]: They work with the PlayStation 3.

49:02.133 --> 49:04.374
[SPEAKER_06]: Seprock1215 says, Rob, just play Rock Band.

49:04.414 --> 49:06.395
[SPEAKER_06]: Ironically enough, I was playing Rock Band last night.

49:06.455 --> 49:12.159
[SPEAKER_06]: One of my friends was filming me, and I wouldn't be surprised if that shit ended up on MySpace TV or YouTube or any of that stuff.

49:12.239 --> 49:15.041
[SPEAKER_06]: But I hope not, because I look like an idiot when I play Rock Band.

49:15.361 --> 49:16.242
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially the singing.

49:16.562 --> 49:17.363
[SPEAKER_06]: I was horrible.

49:18.083 --> 49:18.463
[SPEAKER_06]: Horrible.

49:18.483 --> 49:20.004
[SPEAKER_06]: Because none of those songs are in my key.

49:20.225 --> 49:21.005
[SPEAKER_06]: I would just like to share.

49:22.246 --> 49:22.346
[SPEAKER_06]: So.

49:24.255 --> 49:26.216
[SPEAKER_01]: It was hard to play the drums and listen to that.

49:26.236 --> 49:27.017
[SPEAKER_01]: She's fucking hardcore, I love it.

49:53.502 --> 49:54.463
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

50:23.082 --> 50:36.770
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and actually this is sort of, well, it's old news if they're on your, um, DeviantArt friends list, but, um, uh, Udon Crew has been, um, working on, uh, new Street Fighter comics.

50:37.490 --> 50:39.171
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have been for quite some time.

50:39.251 --> 50:46.535
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, in 2008 there's a Street Fighter II Turbo comic that is to be out and I really, really love the work that Udon Crew has done on this.

50:46.895 --> 50:48.716
[SPEAKER_01]: They're also bringing out, though, um,

50:49.204 --> 51:17.720
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of the different comics that are from overseas but they're also doing a Street Fighter Legends one that's different focus comics on different ones they're also doing a one for Street Fighter 3 they're also bringing out some of the other collections that came out overseas like the

51:18.884 --> 51:26.086
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been doing Sakura Ganbaru, which I read a long time ago in scans, but it's pretty cool.

51:28.526 --> 51:28.906
[SPEAKER_06]: Alrighty.

51:29.386 --> 51:30.006
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty cool.

51:33.587 --> 51:41.068
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you can also go on DeviantArt and you can add Udon to your friends list, and I'll get the name in a sec.

51:41.469 --> 51:41.709
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

51:43.189 --> 51:43.669
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see here.

51:44.375 --> 51:47.637
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, there's some interesting news coming out about Grand Theft Auto 4.

51:48.557 --> 51:54.520
[SPEAKER_04]: They've rated it in Australia already, MA15+, which is good for two reasons.

51:54.780 --> 51:59.882
[SPEAKER_04]: One, it's not going to be adults only over there at least, and I know a lot of games get banned in Australia.

52:00.922 --> 52:11.467
[SPEAKER_04]: Two, the fact that it's actually been rated, first off, may indicate that it's actually coming out soon, and possibly within the time frame that they had originally said, which was April 1st.

52:11.849 --> 52:21.217
[SPEAKER_04]: Although, the other thing, 3 Speech, I believe, said that Grand Theft Auto 4 was coming out around the same time as Killzone 2 and LittleBigPlanet.

52:21.297 --> 52:22.858
[SPEAKER_04]: So, let's hope that's not true.

52:23.218 --> 52:25.720
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's hope it's actually coming out before holiday 2008.

52:27.021 --> 52:28.563
[SPEAKER_04]: Go spring release, come on.

52:29.383 --> 52:30.304
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to play this game.

52:32.986 --> 52:33.767
[SPEAKER_01]: I found it, by the way.

52:33.787 --> 52:34.047
[SPEAKER_01]: What's that?

52:34.087 --> 52:37.089
[SPEAKER_01]: It's udoncrew.dvnart.com There it is.

52:37.450 --> 52:41.313
[SPEAKER_01]: I find a lot of their art wallets in progress, too.

52:42.307 --> 52:43.809
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll save the last minute stories.

52:43.850 --> 52:45.612
[SPEAKER_06]: That is going to do it for our news tonight.

52:45.993 --> 52:46.934
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know what that means.

52:46.974 --> 52:50.320
[SPEAKER_06]: It's time to open up the telephones and let you guys have a say.

52:50.360 --> 52:53.284
[SPEAKER_06]: If you'd like to give us a call, it's 1-877-GAME-OLR.

52:53.404 --> 52:55.708
[SPEAKER_06]: Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

52:55.748 --> 52:57.551
[SPEAKER_06]: We've been doing the Skype thing for a long time.

52:58.015 --> 52:59.376
[SPEAKER_06]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

53:23.837 --> 53:24.978
[SPEAKER_07]: Good, good, good.

53:25.678 --> 53:31.142
[SPEAKER_07]: Last week I went to my final anime con of the year, and I have some gaming stuff for you.

53:32.043 --> 53:32.403
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

53:32.483 --> 53:33.484
[SPEAKER_06]: You got me stuff?

53:34.705 --> 53:36.667
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I mean, just some gaming information.

53:36.747 --> 53:43.732
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not much, because I was working the whole weekend, because my roommate has a company now, so I was helping him peddle his wares.

53:45.073 --> 53:45.513
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool.

53:45.533 --> 53:46.534
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, what kind of stuff?

53:47.695 --> 53:53.239
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, first off, I was talking to a couple of people that were running the gaming room at New York Anime Fest,

53:53.800 --> 54:11.844
[SPEAKER_07]: and things were a little bit different they wanted to be different from normal gaming rooms so there would no be money there this year including no rock band or guitar or guitar hero or anything like that good for them taking a stand because honestly most of the people that go to those cons have all that shit at home don't they?

54:13.164 --> 54:20.486
[SPEAKER_07]: pretty much so there you go they had more like more anime based games and other RPGs and stuff

54:20.990 --> 54:24.872
[SPEAKER_07]: but there was a couple of instances that did happen in the game room from what I was told.

54:28.133 --> 54:36.897
[SPEAKER_07]: A DS got stolen with a game that was in development and some other guy tried to steal another DS but he got caught in doing it.

54:38.057 --> 54:41.398
[SPEAKER_06]: You know that DS game in development is going to be up on the internet any day now.

54:41.598 --> 54:42.819
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably already up there.

54:43.559 --> 54:45.600
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the thing is I don't even know which game it was.

54:46.240 --> 54:46.821
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

54:49.022 --> 54:49.422
[SPEAKER_07]: Also,

54:50.555 --> 54:56.278
[SPEAKER_07]: While I was there, I was working for a couple other websites, and one of my friends runs a site called Gaming Angel.

54:56.358 --> 55:01.580
[SPEAKER_07]: So I was running around getting pictures of female cosplayers doing gaming stuff.

55:02.220 --> 55:09.123
[SPEAKER_07]: I could tell you the most popular gaming cosplayers were pretty much Yuna from Final Fantasy X and Final Fantasy X-2.

55:10.544 --> 55:11.744
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of not a surprise.

55:11.784 --> 55:15.346
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen a lot of Yunas of all shapes and sizes at anime cons.

55:16.428 --> 55:18.049
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie, this next picture is for you.

55:18.089 --> 55:18.249
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

55:43.223 --> 55:45.004
[SPEAKER_06]: The second picture is a person cosplaying knights.

55:45.124 --> 55:48.966
[SPEAKER_06]: And this next one is a picture of something you probably enjoyed when I sent it to your cell phone.

55:49.006 --> 55:51.328
[SPEAKER_07]: This is my friend dressed up as Pit from Smash Brothers Brawl.

56:10.614 --> 56:14.777
[SPEAKER_06]: I got a random text message from Ranma over the weekend with the lady dressed as Pit.

56:15.217 --> 56:16.038
[SPEAKER_06]: That's hardcore, though.

56:16.058 --> 56:16.578
[SPEAKER_06]: I like that.

56:17.379 --> 56:17.899
[SPEAKER_06]: Good for her.

56:18.100 --> 56:18.900
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope she won something.

56:20.421 --> 56:22.703
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure, but I can always ask because she's a good friend of mine.

56:23.024 --> 56:28.508
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know Jamie is a big fan of Silent Hill, so I found a girl who did Pyramid Head.

56:29.208 --> 56:30.069
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool, yeah.

56:32.531 --> 56:35.874
[SPEAKER_07]: And the last two pictures, I've got to say, are my personal favorites.

56:37.095 --> 56:37.855
[SPEAKER_07]: You like Final Fight?

56:38.416 --> 56:38.636
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.

56:38.676 --> 56:38.836
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

56:39.338 --> 56:41.399
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got like almost every version that they put out at home.

56:42.640 --> 56:46.582
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there's this guy walking around with a shirt that says, I got 08 on the front.

56:48.444 --> 56:55.588
[SPEAKER_07]: And on the back, it says, and I quote, a turkey in every oral drum and a fist in every face.

56:56.048 --> 56:56.388
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

56:57.809 --> 56:58.470
[SPEAKER_01]: That was great.

56:59.610 --> 57:00.571
[SPEAKER_06]: That's great.

57:03.194 --> 57:04.535
[SPEAKER_06]: I like how it's just some dude.

57:04.595 --> 57:07.617
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just some dude wearing this shirt like, yeah, I got my Hager 08 shirt.

57:07.857 --> 57:10.258
[SPEAKER_06]: A turkey in every oil drum and a fist in every face.

57:10.358 --> 57:11.239
[SPEAKER_06]: That's amazing.

57:13.980 --> 57:14.740
[SPEAKER_06]: I want that shirt.

57:14.780 --> 57:15.661
[SPEAKER_06]: He should market that.

57:16.381 --> 57:18.382
[SPEAKER_06]: Some other folks in chat are saying they want that shirt too.

57:18.543 --> 57:19.663
[SPEAKER_01]: That shirt is fantastic.

57:20.824 --> 57:24.146
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, since the pic is outposted, maybe I'll end up hearing from the guy.

57:24.166 --> 57:25.947
[SPEAKER_07]: I could find out more information about the shirt.

57:25.967 --> 57:28.188
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a feeling he made it himself, which is pretty damn cool.

57:29.790 --> 57:38.797
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I was just thinking, you know, at Orange Lounge Radio, we should open a t-shirt shop and not just sell official Orange Lounge Radio t-shirts, like, finally, but really funny gamer nerd shirts, such as that.

57:38.878 --> 57:43.421
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I mean, obviously, we wouldn't steal that idea, but we could come up with other things that are just as funny, right?

57:43.762 --> 57:49.446
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, we should get a shirt that says, Rate Me Pyramid Head on it, and, like, a little, with a little chibi pyramid head on it.

57:49.586 --> 57:51.108
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I'd wear that in public, wouldn't you?

57:52.629 --> 57:53.390
[SPEAKER_07]: I definitely would.

57:53.590 --> 57:53.830
[SPEAKER_06]: See?

57:53.850 --> 57:58.554
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I just, I just ran across this shirt, um, early, this weekend that said Mario Luigi, oh, wait.

58:00.762 --> 58:03.243
[SPEAKER_06]: And by the way, patent pending on the Rate Me Pyramid Head shirt.

58:03.263 --> 58:05.243
[SPEAKER_06]: If you steal that idea, I'll sue you for a million dollars.

58:06.743 --> 58:07.343
[SPEAKER_07]: We have proof.

58:07.363 --> 58:08.184
[SPEAKER_07]: It's being recorded.

58:08.384 --> 58:08.864
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

58:09.584 --> 58:09.844
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

58:09.904 --> 58:11.564
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Ranma, anything else you want to share with our listeners?

58:11.584 --> 58:12.744
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad to hear you had fun at the con.

58:13.765 --> 58:14.265
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm glad.

58:14.605 --> 58:15.885
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty much it.

58:16.185 --> 58:21.346
[SPEAKER_07]: And we want the New York chapter of OLR, I want you guys to come out to anime next.

58:21.386 --> 58:24.007
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're working with some friends to try to get you guys out of here.

58:24.527 --> 58:25.107
[SPEAKER_06]: When is that?

58:26.763 --> 58:29.025
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe it's the first or second weekend of June.

58:29.065 --> 58:30.506
[SPEAKER_07]: They just announced their date.

58:30.786 --> 58:32.308
[SPEAKER_06]: Just in time for my birthday.

58:33.769 --> 58:35.670
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, if you make it out for your birthday, we'll take you out.

58:35.730 --> 58:38.452
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I celebrated my birthday with you guys for Father May.

58:38.492 --> 58:39.693
[SPEAKER_07]: It's only fair, you know.

58:39.893 --> 58:41.755
[SPEAKER_06]: And speaking of which, are you coming back this year?

58:41.775 --> 58:43.576
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I do believe we were promised Ranma in 08.

58:45.377 --> 58:45.998
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought I said 09.

58:47.098 --> 58:49.520
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was 09 every other year.

58:49.640 --> 58:50.941
[SPEAKER_06]: I was trying to switch it up.

58:51.222 --> 58:51.902
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

58:52.763 --> 58:53.023
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

58:54.451 --> 58:55.352
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a good one, Ranma.

58:55.372 --> 58:55.952
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for calling.

58:55.972 --> 58:57.113
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye-bye, guys.

58:57.133 --> 58:57.553
[SPEAKER_06]: Take care.

58:57.654 --> 58:57.994
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye-bye.

58:59.095 --> 59:02.277
[SPEAKER_06]: DMN says Roberts and Summers in 08 would be the ticket.

59:02.898 --> 59:04.319
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what that leaves Loki to do.

59:04.399 --> 59:06.921
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki would have to be the official... He's Secretary of State.

59:06.961 --> 59:07.942
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, he's Court Jester.

59:08.922 --> 59:09.423
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what he is.

59:09.703 --> 59:10.784
[SPEAKER_06]: He can be Speaker of the House.

59:14.167 --> 59:17.589
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, he can be the pet at the White House, like Socks the Cat.

59:17.629 --> 59:18.170
[SPEAKER_06]: We have Loki.

59:18.590 --> 59:18.870
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

59:19.411 --> 59:20.512
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, we've got another caller.

59:20.532 --> 59:20.832
[SPEAKER_01]: Jeremy!

59:22.261 --> 59:23.322
[SPEAKER_01]: Show me who's the official pet.

59:23.342 --> 59:23.382
[SPEAKER_01]: GS68.

59:23.402 --> 59:23.743
[SPEAKER_06]: Good point.

59:23.763 --> 59:24.143
[SPEAKER_06]: The ferret.

59:43.052 --> 59:44.073
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't know where the ferret is.

59:44.113 --> 59:47.275
[SPEAKER_01]: The ferret will not stab you in the face and in fact cannot speak.

59:47.456 --> 59:48.597
[SPEAKER_06]: The ferret is MIA.

59:49.277 --> 59:51.038
[SPEAKER_06]: And now we should sell shirts with ferrets on them.

59:51.319 --> 59:52.279
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's just a ferret.

59:52.720 --> 59:53.841
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I think I've seen that before.

59:53.901 --> 59:54.781
[SPEAKER_06]: Never mind, we can't do that.

59:55.062 --> 59:55.742
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to get sued.

59:57.043 --> 59:57.684
[SPEAKER_06]: What's on your mind?

59:58.024 --> 59:59.385
[SPEAKER_06]: Certainly you have something game related.

01:00:00.486 --> 01:00:05.490
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, today I went to the GameStop Tournament Edition, which is what I like to call it.

01:00:07.051 --> 01:00:10.454
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you've been to the new place that we were talking about earlier in the program.

01:00:10.474 --> 01:00:11.235
[SPEAKER_06]: What was it like?

01:00:11.735 --> 01:00:12.696
[SPEAKER_06]: What was up with it?

01:00:13.707 --> 01:00:18.628
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, first, there's a buttload of kiosks over there where you can, like, play games and such.

01:00:20.429 --> 01:00:28.891
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, over in the house where you normally buy games and stuff, you can... They also have a bunch of kiosks over there.

01:00:31.031 --> 01:00:41.734
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, now, did it look like a normal GameStop otherwise, or just a bunch of additional kiosks, or... Well... Actually, no, because, like, they had this big stage where...

01:00:42.449 --> 01:00:48.212
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a whole bunch of gaming kiosks, and I presume that's for tournaments and stuff.

01:00:50.233 --> 01:00:50.734
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, no.

01:00:51.294 --> 01:00:52.835
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a regular day.

01:00:52.855 --> 01:00:53.035
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

01:00:53.115 --> 01:00:54.035
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I guess.

01:00:54.056 --> 01:00:54.176
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

01:01:09.895 --> 01:01:16.962
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I was driving down Stevens Creek and what caught my attention was the subtitle under the GameStop logo by Barnes & Noble.

01:01:18.503 --> 01:01:20.045
[SPEAKER_09]: Where exactly is this GameStop located?

01:01:20.965 --> 01:01:27.191
[SPEAKER_09]: It's on the corner of San Tomas Expressway and Stevens Creek Boulevard in San Jose.

01:01:27.592 --> 01:01:28.593
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh shit, I know where that is.

01:01:28.673 --> 01:01:29.133
[SPEAKER_06]: That's funny.

01:01:29.313 --> 01:01:29.574
[SPEAKER_06]: Huh.

01:01:30.555 --> 01:01:35.259
[SPEAKER_06]: I might have to check that out at some point because I go to... It's right next to the Barnes & Noble.

01:01:36.382 --> 01:01:37.723
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I kind of know where that is.

01:01:37.803 --> 01:01:39.284
[SPEAKER_06]: I go down that area quite often.

01:01:39.304 --> 01:01:42.725
[SPEAKER_06]: I go to Menlo Park almost every other week, so I might have to check that out.

01:01:43.205 --> 01:01:43.765
[SPEAKER_06]: Very cool.

01:01:45.166 --> 01:01:48.568
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, anything else you want to share with our listeners after your trip today?

01:01:50.128 --> 01:01:50.348
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

01:01:51.109 --> 01:01:54.210
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, have a good one and thanks for the first-hand report from being down there.

01:01:55.090 --> 01:01:55.631
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks, you too.

01:01:55.791 --> 01:01:56.351
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, take care.

01:01:57.503 --> 01:01:57.743
[SPEAKER_06]: I like fire.

01:01:57.763 --> 01:01:58.103
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not news.

01:02:21.005 --> 01:02:27.630
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there's apparently a possibility that an 18 plus version of No More Heroes may actually happen in the future for Europe.

01:02:27.990 --> 01:02:30.933
[SPEAKER_04]: So fear not, you may get your uncut version of the game.

01:02:32.874 --> 01:02:35.797
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a funny little Wiimote candy dispenser that's out there now.

01:02:35.877 --> 01:02:38.739
[SPEAKER_04]: If you go to candyaddict.com

01:02:41.260 --> 01:02:43.341
[SPEAKER_04]: You can buy a Wiimote candy dispenser.

01:02:43.421 --> 01:02:46.941
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect gift for those kids who may not be able to get a Wii this Christmas.

01:02:47.562 --> 01:02:50.962
[SPEAKER_04]: Give them an IOU and a Wii candy dispenser.

01:02:51.062 --> 01:02:52.343
[SPEAKER_06]: What a shitty alternative.

01:02:52.643 --> 01:02:53.303
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go to the phones.

01:02:53.323 --> 01:02:53.923
[SPEAKER_06]: We have another call.

01:02:53.963 --> 01:02:54.983
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Haunts Radio.

01:02:55.003 --> 01:02:55.363
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

01:02:56.444 --> 01:02:58.404
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, this is RossDLUT.

01:02:58.884 --> 01:03:00.305
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, RossDLUT.

01:03:00.345 --> 01:03:01.085
[SPEAKER_06]: What is on your mind?

01:03:02.785 --> 01:03:03.365
[SPEAKER_08]: Not much.

01:03:03.725 --> 01:03:10.167
[SPEAKER_08]: I was looking at the November NPDs a few days ago and it's

01:03:10.788 --> 01:03:14.150
[SPEAKER_08]: Pretty damn shocking to see how well some of these games have turned out.

01:03:14.190 --> 01:03:17.111
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, Call of Duty 4 has just been ridiculous.

01:03:17.992 --> 01:03:19.833
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it's just been a lot of sales.

01:03:20.373 --> 01:03:29.638
[SPEAKER_08]: The one thing that's been on my mind, and I mentioned this earlier in the chat, is that, yeah, it's great that the Wii is selling all this hardware, but is it really growing a market?

01:03:29.918 --> 01:03:35.180
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I mean, you look at all these games that are found, and there's a lot of good, you know, third-party games.

01:03:35.581 --> 01:03:37.521
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not like there's nothing on there, you know what I mean?

01:03:37.602 --> 01:03:37.842
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

01:03:38.822 --> 01:03:40.083
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's like nothing has found a...

01:03:41.294 --> 01:03:42.075
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching.

01:03:42.095 --> 01:03:43.075
[SPEAKER_08]: See you next time.

01:03:48.886 --> 01:03:51.348
[SPEAKER_08]: The same people buying the same four games over and over again.

01:03:51.528 --> 01:03:54.630
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there are a shitload of people that are buying the system just for Wii Sports.

01:03:54.790 --> 01:03:59.955
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, because that's the game that Nintendo's been very good at getting out there and kind of creating a fad out of.

01:04:00.015 --> 01:04:05.700
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if the fad is necessarily... I mean, think about the way most people think about video games in their mind.

01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:15.548
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of folks don't even realize that this thing is a system capable of playing a multitude of games, but the way that it's been marketed to the soccer moms and everything is as Wii Sports...

01:04:16.275 --> 01:04:18.076
[SPEAKER_06]: Get up and move your butt while you play games.

01:04:18.196 --> 01:04:20.798
[SPEAKER_06]: Play fake tennis and all that stuff.

01:04:20.978 --> 01:04:23.120
[SPEAKER_08]: They've done an amazing job in that regard.

01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:28.343
[SPEAKER_08]: The question is, I mentioned Zack and Wiki in the chat.

01:04:28.383 --> 01:04:29.964
[SPEAKER_08]: I mentioned No More Heroes.

01:04:31.165 --> 01:04:36.528
[SPEAKER_08]: Even Rayman 2 has been doing pretty well, but not anywhere near as good as the first one, which was Launch Titles.

01:04:36.649 --> 01:04:39.510
[SPEAKER_08]: Launch Titles always have a lucky streak.

01:04:41.672 --> 01:04:42.632
[SPEAKER_08]: If all we're getting is...

01:04:44.239 --> 01:04:46.456
[SPEAKER_08]: is people buying it for Wii Sports I mean...

01:04:47.583 --> 01:04:50.986
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it ever going to be anything more than just a toy, basically?

01:04:51.026 --> 01:04:55.109
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it ever going to be anything that anyone who actually wants more than one game is going to want to have?

01:04:55.529 --> 01:05:00.313
[SPEAKER_06]: I do, because I think Nintendo is going to try to make Wii Fit the next fad.

01:05:01.573 --> 01:05:07.438
[SPEAKER_06]: My gut tells me the way Nintendo's been going with the market lately, I think they are really going to try and make Wii Fit massive.

01:05:07.458 --> 01:05:17.025
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to try and get it out there on the Today Show, and on Oprah and all that shit, and that's going to be their next thing that they're going to push and try to get in every home.

01:05:18.157 --> 01:05:20.539
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I mean, oh, I expect Wii Fit to do well.

01:05:20.579 --> 01:05:23.441
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, all these little stupid little fitness products always do well.

01:05:24.282 --> 01:05:29.266
[SPEAKER_08]: The question I'm asking is, I mean, you see the 360s, even the PS3 to some extent.

01:05:29.306 --> 01:05:32.529
[SPEAKER_08]: The PS3 had a few good-selling games this month.

01:05:32.589 --> 01:05:40.556
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, is it ever going to be where the Wii is a vibrant market, or is it just going to continue to be hostile to everybody who is a Nintendo?

01:05:42.898 --> 01:05:43.738
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, that's the...

01:05:45.151 --> 01:05:46.331
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the real question.

01:05:47.152 --> 01:05:55.454
[SPEAKER_08]: You mentioned, of course, movie games and all that, but a lot of people don't even look at the movie games.

01:05:56.255 --> 01:05:56.795
[SPEAKER_08]: It's shocking.

01:05:56.955 --> 01:06:00.196
[SPEAKER_08]: Even traditional high-selling games.

01:06:00.236 --> 01:06:02.777
[SPEAKER_08]: I was talking to this guy a couple of weeks ago.

01:06:02.937 --> 01:06:09.259
[SPEAKER_08]: EA butted heads with Nintendo so they could put the 32 multiplayer online in Medal of Honor Heroes 2.

01:06:10.578 --> 01:06:18.681
[SPEAKER_08]: They had the Madden Online for 08, where it works with EA Nation instead of the friend codes, and they're not being rewarded.

01:06:18.821 --> 01:06:21.202
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, the third parties are trying, you know, some of them.

01:06:22.902 --> 01:06:24.983
[SPEAKER_08]: And of course, No More Heroes is a tragedy.

01:06:27.804 --> 01:06:30.705
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, but that... Has that even been released here yet?

01:06:30.885 --> 01:06:31.205
[SPEAKER_06]: Which one?

01:06:31.546 --> 01:06:31.966
[SPEAKER_06]: No More Heroes?

01:06:32.026 --> 01:06:33.806
[SPEAKER_08]: It was released in Japan.

01:06:33.866 --> 01:06:37.388
[SPEAKER_08]: Kotaku had a piece on it a couple of weeks ago, where...

01:06:38.567 --> 01:06:42.450
[SPEAKER_08]: Suda51 actually went to a huge game store in Akihabara.

01:06:42.850 --> 01:06:43.451
[SPEAKER_08]: Nobody went there.

01:06:43.951 --> 01:06:45.392
[SPEAKER_08]: He was going to go to sign games.

01:06:45.732 --> 01:06:48.494
[SPEAKER_04]: Piles of toilet paper that you could buy or get for free.

01:06:48.534 --> 01:06:49.195
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, the toilet paper.

01:06:49.335 --> 01:06:51.817
[SPEAKER_08]: They were giving the toilet paper away.

01:06:51.837 --> 01:06:52.798
[SPEAKER_08]: They had a model.

01:06:52.818 --> 01:06:55.620
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a big launch event and nobody came.

01:06:57.921 --> 01:06:59.002
[SPEAKER_08]: That just made me sad.

01:06:59.783 --> 01:07:00.163
[SPEAKER_08]: Really.

01:07:01.604 --> 01:07:02.425
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not just that game.

01:07:02.465 --> 01:07:03.465
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Zack and Wiki.

01:07:03.565 --> 01:07:03.706
[SPEAKER_08]: It's

01:07:04.625 --> 01:07:07.007
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, one of my favorite games, Mercury Meltdown Revolution.

01:07:07.027 --> 01:07:08.427
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think that sold very well.

01:07:09.008 --> 01:07:10.409
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at the box art for that game.

01:07:10.449 --> 01:07:13.371
[SPEAKER_06]: That isn't something that really jumps out at you as something you should buy.

01:07:14.251 --> 01:07:15.032
[SPEAKER_08]: What, Zack and Wiki?

01:07:15.612 --> 01:07:17.333
[SPEAKER_06]: No, the Mercury Meltdown Revolution.

01:07:17.813 --> 01:07:19.915
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, Mercury Meltdown.

01:07:19.935 --> 01:07:26.979
[SPEAKER_08]: I could see it was Mercury Meltdown, but Zack and Wiki, I mean, that's... I mean, that's... screams family-friendly.

01:07:28.040 --> 01:07:29.721
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a very adorable-looking game.

01:07:29.801 --> 01:07:32.483
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not that hard.

01:07:33.383 --> 01:07:34.044
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I mean...

01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:35.921
[SPEAKER_08]: Virtual Console Sales

01:07:53.527 --> 01:08:00.351
[SPEAKER_06]: because I bet that's doing crazy business that if we saw the numbers, we'd get sick over the fact that how these games can be used.

01:08:00.371 --> 01:08:04.893
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Nintendo mentioned that they made $33 million on the virtual console, which isn't bad.

01:08:05.253 --> 01:08:06.174
[SPEAKER_08]: That is bad.

01:08:06.394 --> 01:08:07.134
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, shit.

01:08:07.334 --> 01:08:08.595
[SPEAKER_08]: No, that's not bad at all.

01:08:09.615 --> 01:08:10.516
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not bad at all.

01:08:10.536 --> 01:08:22.502
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I would be very interested because, you know, considering how much of a hassle it is with the Wii to get online sometimes, I mean, at least with the wireless, I do not understand why they didn't have an FNF port right there.

01:08:23.278 --> 01:08:24.719
[SPEAKER_08]: I would never understand that.

01:08:24.759 --> 01:08:27.501
[SPEAKER_06]: That $33 million is literally free money to them.

01:08:27.521 --> 01:08:30.102
[SPEAKER_06]: It's literally free money made out of thin air.

01:08:30.223 --> 01:08:30.563
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course.

01:08:30.623 --> 01:08:31.503
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all old games.

01:08:32.884 --> 01:08:40.429
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, granted, they have to write those manuals and do the QA testing and all that stuff, but that's pennies compared to the bigger picture.

01:08:40.449 --> 01:08:42.470
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?

01:08:43.011 --> 01:08:44.872
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure a skill programmer could do that in an hour.

01:08:45.252 --> 01:08:45.472
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

01:08:46.293 --> 01:08:46.933
[SPEAKER_08]: Crazy.

01:08:47.253 --> 01:08:51.396
[SPEAKER_08]: That's my concern because I have lost three systems and

01:08:52.088 --> 01:09:05.591
[SPEAKER_08]: I want Nintendo to be successful, but I don't want a system that nobody's buying games for eventually taking the rest of the industry down with it.

01:09:07.151 --> 01:09:09.432
[SPEAKER_08]: You see the trends.

01:09:09.732 --> 01:09:12.872
[SPEAKER_08]: You see more of these little mini-game crap coming out.

01:09:14.173 --> 01:09:19.234
[SPEAKER_08]: Personally, I don't blame the third parties because if they're not going to get big sales, they may as well go for the quick buck.

01:09:21.618 --> 01:09:32.042
[SPEAKER_08]: That could end up hurting the Wii after the Wii Sports FAD is done, or if the Wii Fit doesn't work very well here.

01:09:33.182 --> 01:09:45.906
[SPEAKER_08]: Nintendo's riding on real thin ground if they don't at least try to get the quality control up and try to help people realize, hey, this thing has other games.

01:09:45.926 --> 01:09:48.307
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, Mario Galaxy didn't do as well in Japan.

01:09:48.347 --> 01:09:48.927
[SPEAKER_08]: What the hell?

01:09:50.380 --> 01:09:51.501
[SPEAKER_06]: That is a little bit surprising.

01:09:53.722 --> 01:09:57.724
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I thought, honestly, I thought Mario Galaxy was going to do a million in a week.

01:09:58.284 --> 01:09:58.624
[SPEAKER_08]: Honestly.

01:09:59.064 --> 01:10:00.285
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it's Mario.

01:10:01.706 --> 01:10:03.066
[SPEAKER_08]: It's freaking Mario.

01:10:04.867 --> 01:10:08.469
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways, I've been ranting too long and I'm sure a whole lot of people want to get on the line.

01:10:08.529 --> 01:10:09.209
[SPEAKER_06]: That's alright.

01:10:09.950 --> 01:10:11.311
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, we've got to let you go anyway for time.

01:10:11.351 --> 01:10:11.971
[SPEAKER_06]: But take care, buddy.

01:10:12.911 --> 01:10:13.392
[SPEAKER_08]: You do the same.

01:10:13.812 --> 01:10:14.032
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye-bye.

01:10:15.274 --> 01:10:20.678
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, I think that's actually going to do it for calls tonight because we're running a little bit long tonight so we're going to go ahead and start to wrap up the program.

01:10:21.019 --> 01:10:23.180
[SPEAKER_06]: I do want to check and see if there's any more last minute stories.

01:10:24.341 --> 01:10:24.521
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

01:10:25.722 --> 01:10:28.745
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, let's see here real quick I was just going to mention a few things that were kind of funny.

01:10:29.445 --> 01:10:38.993
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, there's actually a game coming out in Europe and this is really sad called MTV Fan Attack and it looks like you're like a VJ running from fans.

01:10:40.294 --> 01:10:40.814
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

01:10:41.815 --> 01:10:42.756
[SPEAKER_04]: Wonderful shit.

01:10:44.157 --> 01:10:44.297
[SPEAKER_04]: Um,

01:10:45.359 --> 01:10:49.081
[SPEAKER_04]: And then this will piss off my wife really bad.

01:10:49.662 --> 01:10:54.625
[SPEAKER_04]: Her big complaint, you remember, I don't know, Rob, you probably remember her complaint about this.

01:10:55.145 --> 01:10:56.326
[SPEAKER_04]: The Golden Compass movie.

01:10:57.006 --> 01:10:59.567
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, the ending was not like the book.

01:10:59.848 --> 01:11:03.009
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a major scene that's cut out of the movie.

01:11:04.891 --> 01:11:07.652
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, not to give away any spoilers, but I will.

01:11:08.533 --> 01:11:14.016
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, a kid gets killed, or sacrificed to open a portal, you know.

01:11:14.693 --> 01:11:16.474
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, if that was in Portal, that'd make the game even better.

01:11:17.994 --> 01:11:18.975
[SPEAKER_04]: Sacrificing bratty kids.

01:11:19.415 --> 01:11:23.716
[SPEAKER_04]: But, apparently, that footage, though, is in the game if you finish the game.

01:11:24.316 --> 01:11:28.958
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I will have to show this to her tonight, and I'm sure a director's cut of the movie will be in order.

01:11:30.899 --> 01:11:31.179
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm.

01:11:32.899 --> 01:11:33.280
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:35.900
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else from Last Minute News tonight?

01:11:39.762 --> 01:11:40.022
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

01:11:40.302 --> 01:11:42.803
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a Me Too cover that's kind of funny for No More Heroes.

01:11:43.023 --> 01:11:43.163
[SPEAKER_04]: Heh.

01:11:44.345 --> 01:12:03.495
[SPEAKER_04]: and then I got a new they have a new wallpaper up on the No More Heroes website which this will now be my new wallpaper if Rob you want to take a look here oh yeah with him charging his that's disgusting beam saber awesome DarkSakura you have anything last minute for us?

01:12:06.196 --> 01:12:12.499
[SPEAKER_06]: I like pie that's not a spoiler no alright anyhow

01:12:13.479 --> 01:12:19.720
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go around and get final thoughts for our program, because we're going to wrap this up and call it a week.

01:12:20.940 --> 01:12:21.800
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, your final thought.

01:12:22.901 --> 01:12:25.701
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope we can fix my computer situation early.

01:12:25.721 --> 01:12:42.784
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually thought of something during the show that I need to check on, because my power supply apparently has a turbo mode on it and a normal mode, and the normal mode has the 12-volt rail broken up into four different rails, whereas turbo has it on one, and I'm wondering if I maybe switch that, if it'll work

01:12:44.266 --> 01:12:48.069
[SPEAKER_04]: Although I still think that the motherboard or graphics card is broken, so we'll see.

01:12:48.969 --> 01:12:53.032
[SPEAKER_04]: But I get to play tons of games this week, taking Wednesday through Friday off to play games.

01:12:54.192 --> 01:12:57.254
[SPEAKER_06]: My final thought is I have a two and a half week vacation coming up.

01:12:57.355 --> 01:12:59.376
[SPEAKER_06]: I just have to get through one more week of work to get there.

01:12:59.756 --> 01:13:00.036
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

01:13:00.056 --> 01:13:00.777
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm so excited.

01:13:01.237 --> 01:13:02.398
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm going to play a lot of games too.

01:13:02.758 --> 01:13:06.400
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm going to work on Orange Lounge Radio stuff, which will be fun.

01:13:06.460 --> 01:13:07.201
[SPEAKER_06]: Jamie, your final thought.

01:13:08.277 --> 01:13:16.124
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to get Orange Box on PC so I can use the editor to put the Half-Life 2 maps in Portal and use the Portal gun in Half-Life.

01:13:17.085 --> 01:13:17.325
[SPEAKER_06]: Fun.

01:13:18.326 --> 01:13:19.127
[SPEAKER_06]: You get to work on that.

01:13:20.728 --> 01:13:21.188
[SPEAKER_06]: Eventually.

01:13:23.206 --> 01:13:27.988
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much for tuning in to our program tonight and supporting independent podcasting and independent radio.

01:13:28.028 --> 01:13:28.868
[SPEAKER_06]: We really appreciate it.

01:13:29.168 --> 01:13:32.610
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember, if you like our show, tell two people you know about the program.

01:13:32.670 --> 01:13:37.271
[SPEAKER_06]: That way, we slowly begin to take over the world as more and more people discover our little program.

01:13:37.592 --> 01:13:42.113
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember, there will be no live show next week with us on December 23rd.

01:13:42.353 --> 01:13:44.234
[SPEAKER_06]: There will be something for the live listeners on the stream.

01:13:44.924 --> 01:13:48.107
[SPEAKER_06]: with some of our other OLR personalities.

01:13:48.147 --> 01:13:50.129
[SPEAKER_06]: But DarkSakura, myself, and Loki will have the night off.

01:13:50.490 --> 01:13:55.595
[SPEAKER_06]: So we will see you back on the podcast on December 30th for the year-end review show.

01:13:55.715 --> 01:13:56.676
[SPEAKER_06]: So see you then.

01:13:56.716 --> 01:13:57.036
