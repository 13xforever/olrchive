14641	25872	Tonight, December 30th, 2007, on this special edition of Orange Lounge Radio, we take a look back at the headlines and games of 2007 with our favorite people, all of our listeners.
32008	33429	DarkSakura, Jamie Summers Hi I have a sinus infection
60948	61728	Sorry to hear it.
62589	64929	You were sick quite a bit this year, I'm sorry to hear.
64949	67990	I wasn't like sick, sick not like when I had the plague.
68431	68591	Right.
68631	70731	However, this is exactly how the plague started.
71232	71612	Oh no.
72152	75333	So I hopped right on it and I have drugs that make me happy.
75773	76633	Well, I hope you feel better.
76693	77374	How was your week off?
78434	81355	Um, well, I did absolutely nothing.
82355	82615	That's good.
82635	87017	I sat on my ass and did absolutely nothing and it was beautiful.
87437	88137	Was Santa good to you?
88877	89918	Santa was decent.
90158	90378	Mm-hmm.
90976	98080	Santa brought me... Actually, Santa Dan gave me a game that I sort of blinked and went WTF over, but I think I'm going to play it.
99040	99340	What's that?
99380	99881	You care to share?
100041	101301	That was... What's it?
101341	102142	Flash Focus.
102742	103783	The vision training game.
103823	104083	Yeah.
104363	108365	So I'm going to play it because clearly I need my vision trained.
109946	110986	Well, I hope it works for you.
111387	117970	And I started... And we... I gave him a... What did I give him?
119111	119911	I gave him Blade Runner.
122155	127838	and I bought him Ratatouille on Blu-ray for use on the Playstation 3 because it's your Blu-ray player too, right?
128538	137222	very cool it's pretty we'll hear more about your game of the week in just a minute that's not a game well, I know, but we'll get the other games as well, right?
137962	146106	well, I gotta introduce he's sitting there waiting for me to say the one and only Techmaster Loki I'm not really waiting for you, but that's fine how you doing tonight, Loki?
146266	149027	I'm doing fine and how was your Christmas?
149047	149687	Was Santa good to you?
150528	151208	I was good to me
151869	154692	Yeah, because I built a new computer.
154832	157074	Oftentimes we buy ourselves the best gifts, right?
157374	157815	Exactly.
158556	164421	Because I buy everything for myself, I don't normally get anything for everyone else because they figure I've already bought it.
165142	166163	Which is usually the case.
167264	169746	But, I don't know.
170127	170347	All right.
171246	171666	TigerClaw
196278	202201	wants to know if Loki has heard that Black Wolf bought the Eye of Judgment.
202401	203041	Good for him.
203121	207023	That's one more towards one million, which will never, ever, ever happen.
208643	208904	Ever.
209164	214906	And I remember, just to reiterate from two weeks ago, it has to sell a million copies.
216272	216813	Some day.
239847	241487	I think Bobby's doing his own year-end show tonight.
241507	242308	It's probably still going.
242328	243708	That's probably where some of our listeners are.
243748	244048	Who knows?
244608	248369	But meanwhile, we actually are going to continue on doing the things we usually do.
248429	250909	We weren't here last week because of the holidays.
250990	256611	So, you know, Merry Christmas, Kwanzaa, Hanukkah, Solstice, Ramadan, whatever the hell it is you celebrate.
256671	257191	I hope it was good.
257231	258931	Or nothing at all, if you're atheist, right?
259651	260792	I hope it was good, whatever you did.
260812	262172	Ramadan's not until, like, later in the year.
262832	263892	Oh, what am I mixing it up with?
264633	264893	Oh, well.
265713	266013	Who knows?
266093	266393	Who cares?
267396	268076	Somebody cares.
268376	269196	Maybe it's Festivus.
269817	271057	Because they're so similar.
271357	273558	I'm just trying to be PC and not leave anybody out.
273998	274658	So there you have it.
274678	276218	Whatever it is you celebrate, I hope it was good.
277058	279519	Let's talk about our gaming weeks, because we do talk about that.
279799	281539	I guess I should say our gaming two weeks.
281900	283260	DarkSakura, how was your gaming two weeks?
284380	287281	I got Orange Box, so I played some Portal.
287901	292582	I've decided that I really like Half-Life 2 Episode 2, which Dan beat last night.
295083	296223	I played a lot of pinball.
297583	299084	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
328174	329294	Which I have on my DS.
329854	330295	Very cool.
330535	334616	But I've really just been more, you know, doing more Portal.
335776	336176	Portal's fun.
336196	338337	I can't play very much of it because I get sick.
338517	341077	And, and, and, and, and, Dan got me Rock Band.
342017	342117	Oh!
342137	344098	I said I was going to get it, and I did.
344358	344798	Very cool.
344818	346058	And our guitar broke the first day.
346759	347099	Don't.
347859	350660	So we've been using the Guitar Hero guitars because we have two.
350860	351180	Gotcha.
351560	356021	Well, we actually have a whole bunch of them because Dan's friend, Will, his stuff lives at our house sometimes.
356301	356541	Gotcha.
356561	356681	Gotcha.
357080	360783	and Dan got my Iron Lung just for me and I can't say that I like it.
360803	361643	I need to buy that.
363024	365686	And I wasn't in the same room listening to it but it sounded like a cover.
366507	367287	Oh, it's not the original?
367307	370329	But the music is all dead on.
370429	378175	Some of the covers just are like... Well, maybe they didn't want to get sued like the Guitar Heroes 80s people did.
378275	380797	And I sing Creep and I sing it the right way.
380937	381137	Did you?
381157	381237	Yeah.
381826	382466	I need a case for Rock Band
410712	414893	Dark Knight in chat says, I would love to hear Jamie singing.
414973	417634	Any possibilities of YouTubes in the future?
440152	441472	Not on YouTube.
441713	445434	If my throat doesn't kill me and I'm drunk enough, maybe.
446654	447254	There is hope, kids.
447294	452096	My whole problem is that every year I get a sinus infection without fail.
452336	453156	This we all know.
453856	455757	But I always am sick on New Year's Eve.
456037	463759	I'm telling you, man, we need to get that video from Eddie that has a rice princess doing sabotage.
464780	466700	Way better than me doing even Timmy.
466920	468961	It's hilarious.
470012	476234	Well, at any rate, I always get very, very drunk while I'm very, very sick, which is pretty stupid.
476915	482277	And then they make me sing Karaoke Revolution, and last year I tried to sing Snake Eater, and I had no voice.
484978	485798	I had no voice.
487118	488439	So I was like, Snake Eater!
489759	490700	That's what it sounded like.
492173	496679	Actdeft is in chat, and Actdeft is saying that we should go out on tour.
497099	501565	He says the OLR World Tour, the Sensible World of Podcasting Tour, a.k.a.
501605	505530	the Fag Your Anger Tour, which is an inside joke from 2007, of course.
505910	508153	I like that, the Sensible World of Podcasting Tour.
508173	508674	That's a good name.
509195	509855	That's very cool.
509875	510256	That's very good.
510296	511436	All right, let's move on to Loki.
511456	512457	How was your gaming week, Loki?
513138	518681	Well, this week, or actually last week and the week before last, I took some time off to play games.
519842	521003	And let's see.
521563	530028	I didn't play as much as I thought I would because I ended up playing mostly Saints Bro because I'm trying to finish it months after it's come out.
530108	531369	But, you know, trying to finish it.
531889	532450	I'm actually...
533516	534557	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
551033	553333	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
580313	580893	It's just weird.
581574	586897	Because I think if I replace the... They have the X-clamp on there that you can replace the heatsink.
587678	588358	It should fix it.
588398	593841	Because I hear something underneath the board that sounds like... I don't know, like a ball bearing rolling around.
593861	599345	I think that's actually some of the solder stripped off the board and actually kind of clumped up into a little ball.
599785	602207	So I'm guessing that some of the solder is probably...
603903	605123	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
625373	629436	And then I played a little bit of Final Fantasy XII Revenant Wings.
629817	630818	It's okay.
631138	631578	I don't know.
631718	632739	It's a little different.
633080	637383	I guess the combat system is kind of similar to Final Fantasy XII a little bit.
637964	647852	But I guess because I didn't play XII, the impact of these characters and when they're like, oh, this person came, it's like, okay, who are you?
647992	648953	I don't know who you are.
650728	655071	So it's okay for me, but probably I should have played 12 before I played the DS game.
655091	660275	But hey, that's their damn fault for releasing one game on the DS and one on the PS2.
661556	662817	Let's see, what else did I play?
663417	667240	I actually played quite a bit of No More Heroes.
667421	668722	That game is fucking awesome.
669382	670383	It seriously is awesome.
670723	676267	After reading a fact on GameFAQs that was actually in English, I kind of figured out how to actually play the game.
677568	677989	Pretty cool.
678049	679730	I finished the first boss and
680245	680746	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
701242	709026	Right now I've run into the problem where I need a good program to read temperatures because every single program they have reads it differently and I want to know which one's correct.
709626	711287	So I don't fry something.
711527	714328	But my chip's overclocked from 2.6 GHz to 3.3 right now.
714368	715469	And then Crysis runs about 35-40 frames per second.
723584	749758	but I want it to run faster and I'm also getting another graphics card because I replaced my old GTS or my 8800 GTS with the new one that's faster the GTS 512 and then I'm getting a second one, the SLIM so hopefully Crysis will run I'm shooting for 50 frames per second or 60 I doubt that's going to happen but smoother the better
751061	752843	All right, well, quite a lengthy gaming week, Loki.
752863	753884	Jeez, you're busy.
755125	756527	Mine kind of pales by comparison.
756847	763094	You know, since the family of mine doesn't do a whole lot for the holidays, William and I decided to take a last-minute getaway to Reno.
763895	768657	And so, you know, Reno, not to offend any of our listeners who might live in Reno, but it's kind of a poor man's Vegas.
769117	774458	You know, there's not a whole lot to do in Reno except, you know, go to the big three casinos.
774478	780180	But we did go to one of the casinos there, Harrah's, and just randomly we found ourselves in the arcade.
780220	788403	And I'll tell you what, the Harrah's arcade was actually kind of cool because there was a lot of classic shit in there that we got to kind of take some time to look at, including...
789643	790244	DDR4thMix Solo Machine
808486	811388	and I haven't seen one of those in years.
811849	814871	And of course, William's like, you gotta get up and dance, you gotta dance.
814891	816232	Like, I haven't played DDR forever.
816272	817413	Harrah's Tahoe, you said?
817793	819674	No, that's Harrah's Reno, not Tahoe.
819694	819974	Harrah's Reno.
820114	820315	Yeah.
820835	823397	I played on that DDR 4th Plus machine.
823677	823857	Yes.
823897	824738	Yes, the solo one.
824838	825979	I do remember that now, but...
826846	827346	Yeah, that's funny.
827766	828386	You know what's weird?
829406	833387	The casino is very odd because the arcade is way back there.
833427	838028	It's not like Circus Circus, which has a new pump-it-up machine right in the middle of everything.
838348	843329	But at Harrah's, you have to go all the way back, and it's back in a dark corner.
843349	843729	It's kind of sad.
843749	849590	I'm guessing the pump-it-up machine is probably right in the front of their arcade where the third Korean machine used to be for a while.
850410	856211	And now GS68 is telling me that at the El Dorado, they have a fourth-plus solo machine, which I completely missed somehow.
856963	857363	That's alright.
857383	858044	You know what I was doing?
858104	860046	I was gambling and losing a lot of money.
860226	861967	That's okay.
862087	863008	I won jackpots.
863188	864289	I won a silver jackpot.
864309	864449	Nice.
864689	866450	Except it was on a penny machine, so I only won $35.
866490	867171	That's alright.
867211	870093	You have to remember that Solo sucks anyways.
872375	873176	That's a dated joke.
873256	875838	Oh my god, a DDRUSA mix machine.
876398	876678	Yes.
876858	877559	Oh, rad.
877979	878580	That takes me back.
878840	879741	Oh yeah, that takes me back.
880321	880741	Good times.
880802	881342	I love DDRUSA.
882248	883569	So yeah, but here's the sad thing.
883609	884670	I had to play on trick.
885050	887051	Like, remember when I used to be really good at DDR?
887211	889553	And you were good at DDR, and you were good at DDR.
890174	891614	You used to play doubles, Jamie.
892655	895937	I used to play doubles on like five feet.
896518	902462	I still play doubles and hope that death comes to me, but... Those were the days.
903231	928714	and then actually it's funny because some of my actually those of you guys that know Extifer Extifer's sister got married over the weekend and she married somebody who used to work at Konami's QA department with Shane so I saw a lot of people from my DDR days because he obviously invited all his old co-workers I saw some people from the old DDR days I hadn't seen him forever so it was really cool kind of a little bit of reunion so it was nice anyhow
929232	931493	Moving on, that has nothing to do with Game of the Week, that's just reminiscing.
932133	934574	As far as other games, I played some World of Warcraft, of course.
935994	950519	I now have, like, I think three PvP purples and some crafted rare epic stuff, so I'm definitely starting to exhaust everything there is to do at level 70, but I still have lots of instances to run and alts to level.
951119	952780	And also, I'll tell you what I've been playing.
953600	956321	Santa brought me a copy of Super Mario Galaxy on the Wii.
957572	966217	Which I'd played before on our preview show, but it was nice to have some more time to play it without kind of that pressure of, you know, everything we're doing is being broadcast on the internet, right?
966257	968178	So I just kind of had time to take it slow, take it easy.
968879	969699	I fucking love it.
969939	971360	It's... You know what?
971720	973981	Like... And you know, I've said this on the show before.
974021	975282	Folks have been listening for a while.
975602	977864	I thought Mario 64 was a little bit overrated.
978404	982286	I did not think Mario 64 was the best Mario game of all time or any of that stuff.
982746	984047	I just didn't see it.
984087	985488	I mean, it's a good game, yes.
985608	987089	In fact, it's a great game, but it wasn't...
987629	990692	There was something about it I didn't quite like as much.
990972	993934	But Mario Galaxy, it really is all that.
994014	999759	I love some of the puzzles in it, like that gravity puzzle where you're inside the tube and the gravity's changing in a different way.
1000139	1001340	It's cool.
1001961	1002321	I love it.
1004082	1009907	I definitely recommend if you're a Wii owner, you have to get Galaxy because this is the type of game that the Wii was really made for.
1010808	1012449	I've definitely been spending a lot of time on that.
1012589	1013930	And thank you, Santa, for bringing me that.
1015031	1016973	So that's pretty much going to do it for my Gaming Week.
1017665	1019246	How about you guys on the chat room?
1019266	1020467	How was your guys' gaming week?
1021147	1023769	I see a lot of people were naming Beatmania 2DX Distorted.
1025890	1029032	Rock Band was played by Color of Sakura.
1029913	1031454	Legend of Zelda Phantom Hourglass.
1033775	1036537	Xene was playing Persona 3.
1036637	1040540	That's one of those games that came out this year that I totally missed.
1040680	1041680	Oh, what did you think?
1042341	1043141	It's easy.
1043762	1045383	It's a fucking easy game.
1045863	1046343	That was it.
1046744	1047144	It wasn't
1047554	1052861	The last boss is kind of, I guess, a little bit more difficult than the rest of them, but it was really easy.
1053502	1057347	It's just, I'm not that great at games, but come on.
1057407	1059289	I mean, seriously, it wasn't a challenge at all.
1061791	1066375	Anyhow, let's get into some housekeeping and then we'll get into some of tonight's news and I'll tell you how the rest of the show is going to work too.
1067296	1069158	Our show is going to be a little bit different tonight.
1069858	1072861	We're going to actually open up the Skype line a little early tonight.
1073562	1081809	Of course, now that I'm noticing that a lot of our regulars aren't here, I'm hoping that we're going to get some calls on Skype line because we really want you guys to participate.
1081849	1084011	But if you guys don't call, we'll figure something else out.
1084311	1085232	But basically what we're going to do...
1085752	1086413	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1109847	1110227	DarkSakuraLoki
1128683	1129123	DarkSakura.com
1152677	1153498	Jamey has one or two stories
1170197	1179722	Okay, anyways, this week, some stuff that's probably not a big surprise happened, including Sony of America Trademarked Resistance 2.
1180102	1180963	Oh my god, really?
1181023	1183284	They're going to make a sequel to a game that sold a lot for them?
1183864	1185925	Oh my god, that is such a shocker.
1186085	1187386	I'm so surprised.
1187586	1189347	So surprised.
1190848	1193489	Anyways, Kira Yamaoka, one of our...
1194079	1194820	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1219153	1223634	He was quoted actually saying that the U.S.
1223674	1227395	team's graphical and technical ability is amazing.
1227495	1232376	There's a huge gap, actually, and he's talking about between the U.S.
1232456	1237417	teams and Japanese development houses with the way games are going right now.
1239417	1239717	I don't know.
1239737	1242158	I guess that makes kind of sense, especially with, you know,
1243277	1248343	A lot of the companies being in the U.S., you know, Nintendo, I mean, they're both in Japan and the U.S.
1248383	1252848	and stuff, but I don't know, a lot of the third-party companies are in the U.S., so I guess that makes sense.
1253469	1255571	Not to say the Japanese can't program good games.
1256110	1275354	I want to go off on a tangent real fast, because this discussion was actually, I was talking to one of my friends in the car, we were up very late last night because we drove to Rocky Horror in San Francisco, and it was William, myself, and our mutual friend Jake, and Jake's a big gaming nerd like us, and we were talking about kind of Japanese versus American, I think actually I was talking about this very thing right here, because somehow we were talking about Silent Hill.
1276074	1281618	And it kind of occurred to me, you know, Nintendo's a very Japanese company, whereas Microsoft's a very American company.
1282118	1285280	And Microsoft seems to be kind of winning this.
1285420	1291104	Well, I mean, I guess I shouldn't say that because the Wii is obviously dominating, but the Xbox is kind of dominating in their own way.
1291124	1296087	And it's kind of like, you know, the Xbox kind of caters to what's really big in the American market right now.
1296107	1297348	And that's Internet gaming.
1297848	1302770	And that's something that, for whatever reason, Nintendo has never seemed to capture.
1303090	1305991	Like, you know, Nintendo is not getting on board with internet gaming.
1306271	1309732	They did one game on the GameCube that was a third-party game to begin with, right?
1309772	1311493	And they really haven't done much on the Wii yet.
1311773	1316034	I mean, granted, we have Mario Kart, but we've all seen they can't... The friend codes thing sucks and all that.
1316054	1322316	And we were kind of wondering, like, why is it that Nintendo does not get online gaming?
1322356	1325517	And it kind of struck me, it's probably a cultural difference.
1325657	1326938	And what it probably is...
1328200	1340789	is that arcades are dead here in America, and that's why we're so big on internet gaming, whereas in Japan, it seems like arcades are still, I mean, maybe not what they once were, but they're still very prevalent, and people still meet up to do the gaming.
1341189	1341649	So what?
1341929	1350275	I don't understand that, because they recognize, though, that the US and Europe and stuff are big gaming markets, and maybe even bigger than Japan, and...
1351102	1351703	They recognize it.
1351743	1353924	That's why we're getting so many we's here in the U.S.
1354144	1355886	So it's not like they don't understand that.
1355906	1357447	It's just they're just not doing it.
1357627	1364131	But kind of like why I'm relating it to this story is that when that's their culture, that's their perspective on things.
1364592	1375339	And so maybe I think part of the reason why like a cure of Yamaoka might be kind of really liking what the Americans are doing now is that because it's a different approach based on the way things work here.
1375859	1379402	I'll tell you what it is, and this is pretty much – I mean –
1380179	1380900	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1402677	1404898	and then, of course, it took off here.
1405138	1409640	Problem is, though, Nintendo didn't plan for any sort of online infrastructure.
1409680	1410821	They didn't think it was a big deal.
1411281	1414662	They said, whatever, our systems sell very well by themselves.
1414762	1415803	We have the portable systems.
1416043	1418084	Maybe we'll link it up with the DS and that kind of stuff.
1418564	1419985	And they didn't really do anything with it.
1420305	1422446	Well, come to find out, guess what?
1422566	1424206	Online gaming is really popular.
1424647	1426988	And now they're like, crap, what do we do now?
1427028	1429709	We don't have any sort of infrastructure built for this stuff.
1430535	1432056	And so now they're way behind with all that.
1432096	1433357	Same with the PlayStation Network.
1433417	1436198	I mean, they didn't really have a unified online service or anything like that.
1436218	1439641	I think Sony's issue is that they are stretching themselves thin.
1440141	1444624	Because you notice when games keep getting delayed, like LittleBigPlanet Home keeps getting delayed.
1444944	1448926	I think that to me says that Sony, their thing is that they've been trying to do both.
1449607	1458532	To Sony's credit, I think everything they've been doing, they are the ones that have truly been trying to appeal to a worldwide audience the whole time.
1459235	1460436	But they're stretching themselves too thin.
1460456	1460976	They can't do it.
1461036	1462236	They don't have the resources to do it.
1462756	1471260	Whereas Nintendo has focused their efforts on this, and Xbox, for the most part, has focused their efforts on this, and both have excelled very well, while Sony's spread themselves too thin.
1471580	1474621	Well, and the other thing, too, Microsoft now is starting to figure out, hey, guess what?
1474641	1486566	We've got to think about our Japanese market as well, and that's why they're publishing games like Lost Odyssey, Blue Dragon, stuff like that, to appeal to a more variety of consumer audiences.
1487694	1488274	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1513943	1521047	Even though they're trying to break out of that mold and stuff, unfortunately, a lot of the games that they're still releasing, even look at first-party stuff.
1521067	1521787	I mean, what?
1521847	1523848	You've got Metroid Prime 3.
1523908	1525069	I guess that would be the only game.
1525149	1530552	And maybe Excite Truck that's first-party that would kind of appeal to more than just kids.
1531833	1536335	Some of these games like Disaster Day of Crisis and Project Hammer, which is canceled.
1536755	1542218	I mean, those games could have appealed to some older consumers, but they didn't do it.
1542859	1543519	Manhunt 2 Manhunt 2 Manhunt 2
1565492	1567174	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
1579346	1579546	All right.
1579566	1582828	Well, I was going to turn to the chat room for some comments on this.
1583428	1587070	Some polarizing statements made by us on Viva Pinata.
1587111	1589492	Flaming Bozo says, Viva did not suck.
1589732	1591093	And Poeater says, Viva did suck.
1591573	1593414	So some polarizing opinions there.
1593934	1594195	All right.
1594475	1595335	What did they try to do with Viva?
1595355	1596336	It went from suck to blow.
1596756	1597937	Let me put it this way.
1598057	1601941	Their expectations of Viva Pinata versus what actually happened were a little different.
1601961	1603442	They thought it was going to be the next Pokemon.
1603482	1604243	Yeah, I agree.
1604303	1606885	They set their bar way too high on Viva Pinata.
1607666	1611229	I certainly would never put Viva Pinata on a bad games of the year list.
1611289	1613792	It just wasn't Pokemon.
1613832	1614692	It's not a bad game.
1614913	1616394	It's just a game I'm not going to play.
1616534	1619056	I mean, there are kids, I'm sure, that love the game.
1619377	1620998	There are probably adults that love the game.
1621138	1621879	It's just not for me.
1622219	1625881	Viva Pinata Party Animals, that's crap.
1625901	1630343	I think even like Major Nelson has said Viva Pinata Party Animals sucks.
1630383	1631023	Let me put it this way.
1631043	1634525	And that's pretty bad when the people inside Microsoft don't like the game.
1634565	1637346	The whole thing was they tried to like... I don't know that to be sure.
1637386	1637847	Don't quote me on that.
1637867	1640928	They tried to look at what Pokemon has and kind of emulate that.
1640988	1642729	So they're like, okay, it has a cartoon series.
1642789	1643009	Great.
1643229	1644310	Let's do a cartoon series.
1644570	1645230	And it had a game.
1645510	1646090	Okay, let's do this.
1646371	1649992	Now if we put this out here exactly like Pokemon, it's going to have the appeal of Pokemon.
1650112	1650793	No, it did not.
1651053	1651353	In fact...
1651733	1655715	I thought that adding the cartoon as well is kind of just shoving it down our throats even more.
1656215	1657096	Just leave it as a game.
1657136	1659817	If the game was popular enough to warrant a cartoon, great.
1659877	1660237	Do that.
1660738	1661818	I like Pooh Eater's idea.
1661918	1663119	Viva Manhunt Pinata.
1663959	1664400	There you go.
1665040	1665340	I'm sorry.
1665360	1670663	I did not mean to derail the show with that little tangent, but when hasn't that happened before?
1670943	1671863	Sorry.
1672144	1676586	Next week, SNK will be producing yet another new game.
1676686	1676946	Oh, wait.
1677006	1677486	No, I'm sorry.
1677506	1677826	They're not.
1677846	1680708	They're going to be putting out Metal Slug 3 on Xbox Live Arcade.
1683089	1687130	And the sound of Jamie cheering, by the way, is the only person you'll hear cheering about.
1687431	1687851	You know what?
1688031	1688531	It looks cool.
1688551	1689311	Metal Slug has a cult fanbase.
1689331	1691552	It's supposed to have updated HD visuals.
1691792	1692192	That's cool.
1692272	1698315	Whatever that's supposed to mean, because all the screenshots don't look updated to me, but... Okay, I'll take the word for it.
1698395	1698715	It's good.
1698935	1703496	Does HD visuals mean that they've added bars on the side that are pressed?
1703516	1703917	That's dumb.
1703937	1706077	They're gonna do like they did with Double Dragon.
1706437	1706998	Not Double Dragon.
1707018	1707738	Yeah, Double Dragon.
1708542	1709122	I don't know.
1709142	1709722	It looks okay.
1709842	1711023	I think, hey, you know what?
1711483	1714404	If SNK's listening, if you want to remake the game, great.
1714724	1724646	Or, like, reissue it, but, like, redo all the visuals, kind of like, I don't know, Super Street Fighter 2 HD, whatever, you know, that's going to be coming out.
1724666	1726247	Redo all the graphics, that'd be awesome.
1726307	1729308	Metal Slug might actually be a really fun live game.
1729528	1729788	It is.
1729808	1731188	Like, to play with people on live.
1731248	1734129	And it is going to have co-op over live, so that's kind of cool.
1734149	1734269	Good.
1734980	1743322	and, um, so yeah, it's 800 Microsoft points, should be out Wednesday, no word on if there's going to be another game coming out as well, because it's only one game announced so far.
1743462	1751605	You know, and to Metal Slug's credit, although Loki and I give it a hard time on this show for kind of being the same thing over and over, it really is a lot of fun, I think this will be a good title for us.
1751625	1752525	I just like the, you know,
1753632	1760354	I'd like to make fun of SNK because... They're still making 16-bit games all these years later.
1760374	1763854	The last four games that have come out from them have been anthologies.
1764895	1766695	No offense, I mean, hey, you know what?
1766955	1768235	You're not the only company that does that.
1768335	1769636	Capcom and Activision.
1770536	1771196	Or Midway.
1771936	1775537	But some of the anthologies, like the Mega Man anthology, kicks ass.
1775797	1777097	I don't know.
1777578	1778918	I just, you know, seriously...
1779984	1784206	Metal Slug 3, Metal Slug 1, they've been re-released so many times.
1784847	1789069	It's like, okay, great, we love these games, but let's make something new, okay?
1789109	1807920	Anyways, so there's of course a new Street Fighter movie coming out, and I'm not sure whether you're going to be happy about that or not, but apparently one of the stars that they have casted so far is in the role of Chung-Li, and it's Smallville's Christine Kreek, and
1808604	1810165	I don't know, she doesn't look Asian to me.
1810886	1812127	But hey, she looks hot.
1812147	1813988	Is that the one that plays Lana?
1815669	1816250	I believe so.
1816670	1817430	She's Asian.
1818511	1819532	She doesn't look Asian.
1821313	1823635	I'm sorry, that's not... I don't know.
1824255	1826517	Whatever, it'll work, I think.
1827538	1828198	Is she hot?
1828538	1830600	I mean, that's what most of the boys want to know.
1830680	1831260	Is she hot?
1831661	1832301	And some of the girls.
1832661	1835964	You know, that's the most important thing, isn't it?
1836324	1837665	I mean, ethnicity be damned.
1838214	1847738	Anyways, so I don't know if you really need to be honest, the last Street Fighter movie didn't set the bar too high, so I mean, you don't have to try that hard to make a good movie here.
1847938	1849098	But it had Kylie.
1849198	1851839	Yes, Kylie Minogue was awesome as Cammy.
1853200	1853800	And who was Chun-Li?
1853840	1855220	Ming-Na was Chun-Li.
1855240	1856101	She's on ER now.
1856221	1856841	She wasn't bad.
1857801	1858282	She wasn't bad.
1859882	1863263	Apparently, anyways, I've actually watched this little video here.
1864264	1864724	There isn't
1865558	1868740	A conference that went on, a hacking conference called 24C3.
1869801	1880749	And it's, I guess, an annual four-day conference organized by a hacking group called Chaos Computer Club, where, of course, thousands of hackers and scientists, artists, etc.
1881389	1881729	gather.
1882350	1889395	And one of the things that they showed off was that they have completely hacked the Wii.
1889755	1891116	This is an unmodded Wii.
1891396	1892197	They were managed to...
1892947	1895608	I shouldn't say it's unmodded, but there's no mod ship running in it.
1895789	1903753	And they've, using a specially made disc and a kind of a serial port thing, they called it, what was it, a tweezer attack.
1904934	1909016	They were able to run homebrew software in Wii mode.
1909136	1916200	Usually before that, they've only been able to do it through the GameCube operating system or whatever on there.
1916880	1918401	It's all been limited to GameCube.
1919440	1919720	and so on.
1948840	1951202	You can start and stop the drives and stuff like that.
1951602	1953784	That reminds me of something that I saw on YouTube.
1954304	1955686	I have a feeling we're thinking of the same thing.
1955726	1956006	Go ahead.
1956046	1958628	The guy did the target placing.
1958991	1960692	That shit, that is the same thing I'm thinking of.
1960732	1961832	Wasn't that shit amazing?
1962112	1962652	That was pretty cool.
1962692	1964253	Did you see, okay, did you see that YouTube?
1964273	1971636	The guy, and I can't remember his name, I'm sorry, maybe somebody in chat remembers, but he was a student at some school and he put together this thing where I'll see if I can find it.
1971676	1979979	He swapped the Wiimote and the sensor bar to create this, you know, the television instead of
1980519	1983981	Looking like a normal Wii game, it looked like a portal into another world.
1984001	1987864	He didn't use the sensor bar itself, he actually used two infrareds attached to goggles.
1988204	1991086	Because the sensor bar itself has an infrared reflect.
1991306	1992247	Right, and he put them in the glasses.
1992587	1996429	And it was basically, this YouTube is amazing, it's had over a million views, I'm sure most of you have seen it.
1996850	2005215	But it was basically, he kind of called out a lot of the game developers in it and said, Hey, if you want to do something this cool, you should give me a call or you should do it.
2005475	2006436	I just told you how to do it.
2007562	2008723	It looked amazing.
2008783	2012225	Just even in the little YouTube, the way... Oh, wow.
2012645	2015807	It was, yeah, it was like a head tracking, a VR head tracking is what it is.
2015827	2019469	They have that right now for, like, flight sims.
2019489	2021510	Like, they're showing flight sim 10 or whatever.
2023251	2029875	You can do that, and you can actually do it where it will... That was not a hacking thing this guy did.
2030235	2036359	Well, he made his own custom program, but, you know, still, the hardware he used was all pretty much, you know,
2036963	2038044	Stuff that could easily be done.
2038464	2039225	It just looked amazing.
2039365	2045971	Well, you can adjust, I guess, scale it so you don't have to look completely behind you to look behind you and stuff like that.
2046571	2048193	But, yeah, it's pretty cool.
2048833	2055499	And he had some other things, too, like on how to make a VR whiteboard type thing and some other stuff.
2055779	2056059	Wow.
2056600	2062445	So, anyways, other things to note here.
2064363	2071467	Some that may not be too happy, unfortunately, and I hate to be the one to mention this, but I'm just going to say it.
2072207	2081092	This hasn't really been out there that much, or actually it hasn't been out there yet, this news, but I'll just say it, I guess.
2081973	2085495	It is a very likely situation that Smash Bros.
2085555	2086776	may have been delayed another month.
2089117	2090438	And where is this coming from?
2091365	2097989	Um, I just happened to see a date change in our system for March now for Smash Bros.
2098670	2100150	So it could just be an anomaly.
2100290	2101091	It could be an anomaly.
2101111	2102031	It could be one of those things.
2102632	2104793	Now, here's why I think it might be true, though.
2104913	2106734	Because they're running into problems.
2106774	2112077	I guess there are so many, you know, places that they can manufacture Wii discs.
2112778	2119101	And right now they're at full production, and because of that, a lot of games are getting delayed because they can't manufacture this in time.
2119922	2120002	Um,
2121070	2127294	and they've said a few months ago that all Wii games and some DS games will be affected by this.
2128014	2133657	And so being that the case, one of two things could be happening here.
2133917	2140421	One, distribution may not be getting their copies, but retail will be if there's going to be a shortage like that.
2140621	2146544	If they're anticipating that there's going to be a shortage, they're going to delay it for everybody else for a month, or it really is delayed a month.
2147445	2148986	So right now, just...
2149957	2155098	Don't be surprised if you see that news come out, but I wouldn't confirm it 100% yet.
2155799	2156279	Interesting.
2158359	2158699	I don't know.
2158919	2162300	Now, as some folks are hoping, could it be that they've delayed it to add Mega Man?
2164121	2165721	I somehow doubt that.
2165741	2169762	Didn't the guy who made Mega Man come out this week and say Mega Man is not in Smash Bros.
2169902	2170362	I don't remember.
2170422	2172023	I'm almost positive I read a story about that.
2172043	2176444	Everyone thought that the 20th anniversary of Mega Man, they were going to announce that Mega Man was going to be in there.
2176821	2178822	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2197049	2199671	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2224713	2230496	Anytime that we've been delayed product or whatever, like say, oh, we're not going to ship you this much or whatever, they didn't change the street date.
2230516	2232797	They just, here's the date for this.
2232978	2235539	Oh, by the way, you're not getting any until this time.
2237620	2242103	I doubt they would change the date, but I'm just saying, you know, it's about a month.
2242143	2245645	I think March 9th is what we showed, but keep us posted.
2245845	2246185	We'll see.
2246205	2246685	I'll keep you posted.
2246725	2247986	You heard it here first.
2248206	2249347	I was going to mention one other thing.
2249427	2253669	There's two other games actually that
2254704	2256024	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2275720	2286688	I was going to mention one other thing real quick Silent Hill Origins that was coming out on Playstation 2 in Japan it is coming out over here too
2305365	2307126	Actually, sooner than later, March.
2307726	2308007	Nice!
2309147	2314511	Very excited about that, you know, because I didn't play too much of the PSP version, but PlayStation 2, that might be pretty cool.
2315491	2318793	Even though I guess I could plug in my PSP to my TV and do the same thing.
2320234	2322015	Finally, let's see here.
2322816	2323496	What else we've got?
2323816	2324757	Oh, the DS.
2326042	2327163	I've been playing that already.
2353786	2354566	How's it going?
2354626	2356167	You do Christmas nights this time of year, right?
2356187	2356887	I do Christmas nights.
2356947	2357387	Good times?
2358467	2359708	Very hard to watch on my TV.
2360968	2363929	Jamie, you got a story for us real quick, and then we're going to open up the Skype line.
2364189	2368711	So, 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype, is Orange Lounge Radio.
2369331	2371131	Call in and talk to us about the year 2007.
2371191	2382035	This is more of a humor thing, because I think it's pretty damn funny, is that Nokia's N-Gage first access platform has been delayed.
2382972	2383312	Dantum
2410646	2411546	Yeah, by this news.
2411706	2413067	Whatever happened to the fucking Phantom?
2413427	2414407	The lap board came out.
2415047	2415328	Really?
2415788	2415968	Yeah.
2416548	2418449	So it went from being console to lap board?
2418669	2418849	Yeah.
2419509	2419949	Interesting.
2420169	2422610	I didn't think the console was going to work when they were showing it off.
2423370	2424370	Because it was just a PC.
2424430	2425371	I'm like, I don't get this.
2425731	2427411	Who would download PC games?
2427792	2430352	Apparently Steam worked, so I was wrong there.
2430452	2433493	But still, I mean, I don't know.
2433653	2436594	If they had a console that was just Steam, that might be pretty cool.
2437535	2437795	Maybe.
2438275	2438535	All right.
2439249	2443453	Well, our Skype line is open, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
2443533	2445495	Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
2445535	2451721	Please remember, though, if you're going to call us on Skype, give our test call a call first.
2451741	2457146	That's Echo 123 on Skype, and that way you don't sound like shit when you get through on the Skype line.
2457606	2464633	And what we're going to do is we're going to recap some of the stories that we went over this year in the various months of the year.
2465595	2467776	And I'll explain how that works as soon as we take our first call.
2467836	2468796	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
2468816	2469196	Who's this?
2469876	2470917	This is Raven's Dolphin.
2470957	2471537	Can you hear me?
2471817	2472877	I can hear you, sir.
2472917	2473397	How are you?
2474398	2475018	I am fine.
2475058	2478919	Well, goddamn, if it wouldn't be a year in review show if we didn't have you here, Raven's Dolphin.
2478959	2480219	So I appreciate you calling in.
2480259	2480820	How are you doing?
2481700	2482420	I'm doing fine.
2482460	2484661	I'm playing Mario Galaxy just like you are.
2484941	2485881	Isn't it fucking great?
2487182	2488442	I do think it's fucking great.
2488522	2489062	I really do.
2489602	2489962	Excellent.
2490443	2491723	Well, go ahead.
2492608	2495530	The thing about Mario Galaxy that impresses me is the graphics.
2496331	2502917	I know the Wii's a piece of shit, that's what some people say, but I really think that the Wii can pull off some really good graphics.
2503197	2508381	You know, and we've said it before on this show, Nintendo loves to have aces in their sleeves.
2508922	2516468	And their systems always have these little hidden features and are probably capable of much more than people usually give them credit for originally.
2516488	2518049	That's how they extend the life of their systems.
2518450	2521092	So I'm sure you have not seen the best looking Wii game yet.
2522148	2524109	Yeah, but this one is pretty good.
2524229	2530032	I really like what they did with the little effects, the little, like, twinkles, the little things.
2530052	2533693	You go in the air, you see little things here and there, you know?
2533753	2535034	The water shines.
2535154	2540797	Well, something to keep in mind, too, Raven's Dolphin, is that Mario Galaxy was not a ported GameCube game either.
2541117	2541597	You know what I mean?
2541737	2546099	It was truly an original game, and I think that's part of what made it stand out.
2546119	2546840	You know what I mean?
2547560	2549521	But it is colorful, so that's all I'm going to say.
2550217	2554679	Raven, we're going to ask you to help us kind of recap the year here a little bit.
2554719	2556179	We're going to kind of go month by month.
2556219	2563562	I'm going to tell you about some of the top stories we went over, and I'd like to hear your thoughts on what you thought was really the standout story from that month.
2563642	2564043	Sound good?
2565183	2566403	I was waiting for this, yeah.
2566463	2568924	All right, then we'll get your best and worst game of the year at the end.
2568964	2574387	So let's take a trip all the way back to January, and January started off with Orange Ones Radio episode 215.
2575587	2577067	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2598180	2599041	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2627761	2632463	It is a very tragic thing, and I remember that you didn't do a show that week when that story broke.
2632503	2632803	That's right.
2632843	2634184	We only did three shows in January.
2634204	2636865	I don't remember what happened, but we were off for a week in January.
2636885	2638226	I was at Disneyland.
2638606	2640027	Oh, we both were at Disneyland.
2640047	2640888	That's what it was.
2640928	2643309	That was my first trip to Disneyland in a long time, so we were off.
2643369	2646350	I think it was Martin Luther King weekend, and that's the weekend it all went down.
2646911	2647231	You're right.
2647271	2654635	We weren't on that week, and we came back, and we were just like, you know, if you think it's bad on the internet, try living here where it's all going down.
2655306	2657931	Sorry, you were doing your little guise on the show and you recapped it there.
2659152	2667005	I think that I was just whole surprised that, you know, no one had ever heard of, you know, drinking too much water.
2667849	2686614	and it was so funny because I remember especially in Sacramento, the area where we live, there's only been so many, there has not been, I don't have a number, there have not been that many water deaths in this country, but there have been multiple ones in the Sacramento region in the past couple years because there was the frat kid.
2687014	2688135	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2703613	2708934	Unlike I predicted earlier in the year, I believe when this story first launched, 107.9 is still the end.
2708974	2710414	It's still owned by the same people.
2711094	2713075	They have a new morning program in place now.
2713095	2718216	I don't remember what they're called, but they have other, you know, wacky morning DJs on there doing their thing.
2720036	2721716	Same old stick, but with different people.
2722876	2731178	Well, I think it was good that the ones that were in charge of that got fired, because honestly, I guess the majority of people in the world just don't know better.
2732218	2732718	You know, it's
2733707	2735308	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2755626	2758787	We had the Weather Channel was forthcoming in the News Channel.
2758807	2760987	Well, the News Channel finally launched in January.
2761467	2768449	And the reason why it's kind of noteworthy is because it was a game console doing something pretty major other than games.
2769049	2769969	It was the News Channel.
2770789	2773370	I have not watched the News Channel ever.
2774290	2774530	Ever?
2774650	2775550	You don't need to.
2775670	2777250	Does anybody actually use the News Channel?
2777651	2778271	How about chat?
2778331	2779911	Does anybody in chat use the News Channel?
2781175	2782676	Complete waste of time.
2782856	2784176	Should be able to remove that crap.
2784256	2785397	Raven, do you use the news channel?
2786037	2787518	I used it when it first came out.
2787538	2790539	Do you remember what the first headline when you went to technology was?
2791439	2791799	What's that?
2792220	2792700	Oh, it was the...
2794022	2795423	Wasn't it the woman dying from the Wii?
2795603	2795944	Or what?
2796264	2799046	No, it was the PlayStation 3 launching in Europe.
2799426	2800287	I remember that.
2800327	2801107	That's right.
2801348	2802328	Wow, you got a good memory.
2802388	2802869	That's right.
2802989	2809614	I remember I was amused because the first story I brought up in the technology was a story about the PlayStation 3 launching.
2809654	2811595	I'm like, I'm reading about the PlayStation 3 on my Wii.
2811635	2812176	This is weird.
2814117	2815418	Feels like an oxymoron, doesn't it?
2816222	2818563	Actdeft says my brother does use it daily.
2819663	2821504	Color of Sakura says I have used the channel.
2821864	2824585	Macman says I use the new channel to wipe my ass.
2825845	2827726	I don't use the channel at all.
2828106	2831087	I think I looked at it once and I went like, ah, don't need it.
2831947	2835829	I use it once in a while just kind of to spin the globe.
2837469	2841331	And check out, because like sometimes you really want to know what's going on and like, you know.
2843671	2845392	I just want to spin the globe and make everyone dizzy.
2845412	2845472	Yay!
2845902	2848003	Yeah, but everyone forgot about it long after.
2848043	2848804	It lingered like a bad smell.
2848824	2849084	Seriously.
2868888	2869788	Just like some other ones.
2869948	2875491	I don't know, because it seemed like that story came up a couple other times, because then, like, you know, the family was going to sue Nintendo.
2875511	2876571	I remember that was a big follow-up story.
2876591	2877432	Yeah, because they're stupid.
2877492	2881373	And that's ridiculous, because Nintendo didn't have anything to do with it other than making the product.
2882374	2882774	Oh, God.
2882814	2884715	Stupid people irritate the shit out of me.
2884835	2888576	But because they made the product, they engineered the desire for the product.
2888596	2891457	To be fair, they didn't actually sue Nintendo.
2891497	2892978	It was an exploratory thing.
2893018	2895199	They were thinking of doing it, and they decided not to.
2895219	2896219	So intelligence didn't prevail.
2896239	2897420	Even considering it stupid.
2898649	2899689	Thanks for watching!
2916394	2920316	A Games as Porn bill failed in the state of Utah.
2920997	2923998	Yeah, especially the games that are out now, I would not consider those porn.
2924879	2925399	Jeez.
2925719	2926199	Yes, that's right.
2926279	2931602	Utah was going to, at one point, put some of the adult games, basically regulate it the same way they did porn.
2932623	2933944	But that bill failed in early January.
2933964	2936125	That makes absolutely no sense to this day.
2936425	2939186	I still think to myself, okay, Mario as Porn.
2939366	2940807	That's a great idea, Utah.
2941868	2944129	Now, Manhunt 2, though, is Manhunt 2 porn?
2944829	2944969	Nope.
2945150	2945830	To them, it is.
2946428	2948150	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2969568	2969888	All right.
2970189	2984308	Well, moving on through the month, episode 219, one of the stick-out stories from that episode, Codemasters had to replace faulty Bubble Bobble DS cartridges when the boss in level 30 didn't fucking show up.
2986394	2987074	You gotta love it.
3003702	3008584	and spilled the beans on some of the upcoming releases, including Jetpack and Tetris Online.
3008904	3017366	But what should also be noted is that this news came all the way back from February, and there were some other game titles that we never saw, like Juiced 2007 and Ob's Pinball.
3017766	3023208	Of course, you know, a game like Ob's Pinball could have become the Pinball FX game that we did get.
3023268	3027189	Juiced 2007 is just Juiced 2 Hot Import Nights.
3028109	3030450	Oh, and it wasn't an actual arcade game or what have you?
3030470	3030650	No, no.
3030830	3032591	Oh, okay, gotcha.
3032611	3032791	It was...
3033737	3034178	Those people suck.
3049153	3057776	Episode number 221, the last show we did in February, was the week that Warhawk was announced that it was only going to be a downloadable title on the PlayStation 3.
3057916	3059376	Well, it was rumored.
3059416	3060377	Was it rumored?
3060417	3061917	No, it was confirmed for a while.
3061937	3068659	Yeah, it was confirmed for a while, and then they came back and said, but we're also going to release it on Blu-ray with the headset and all this stuff.
3069139	3074541	So that was the week, though, that Warhawk was originally announced as a download-only title, which was big because...
3075365	3088972	You know, obviously this is one of the games that Sony was pushing and pushing when they first showed off the PlayStation 3, and for this to kind of go back and say, well, we're just going to make it a download-only game was kind of... Six-axis, all that stuff was going to be in it.
3089292	3100458	I'll never forget when they were showing off the six-axis, and he was trying to land the jet on the actual carrier thing, and it almost tipped it off the edge of the cliff because he didn't land it right.
3101001	3101521	That's hilarious.
3101541	3103362	That's what I'll remember of Warhawk.
3103863	3113728	Alright, so Raven, we have games as porn in Utah, Bubble Bobble, Broken, PartnerNet, Spills the Beans, and Warhawk download only on PlayStation 3.
3113768	3115669	What do you think had the most impact from February?
3115729	3117210	The longest lasting impression on 2007 for gaming.
3118903	3122346	Or how about the fact that, did anybody test this game?
3132932	3134693	There's no testers in Codemasters.
3134753	3135613	That's hilarious.
3136093	3145256	Apparently not, and it's kind of sad because I have a lot of friends who have been game testers that do very good jobs for various companies that they've worked for, and it was just kind of sad.
3145496	3158721	This kind of gave game testers everywhere a bad name that something like this slipped through the cracks, but obviously this was management cutting corners to meet some deadlines, and probably the game did not go through the extensive testing it should have, right?
3158741	3159221	It should have, right.
3159921	3165223	Yeah, but to me, it just boggles the mind how the boss never showed up.
3165823	3167603	I mean, how do you miss that?
3168264	3168644	I don't know.
3169244	3170084	Good question.
3170204	3173605	Chatroom and Loki and DarkSakura, you guys agree with Raven's picks?
3173625	3177707	You think the Wii for a Wii and the Bubble Bobble were probably the biggest stories out of those months?
3179907	3180267	Yeah.
3180467	3181668	Yeah, I guess.
3181848	3182048	Yeah.
3182771	3183091	All right.
3183672	3200467	Well, Raven, while we get the chatroom's impressions of your picks there, why don't you tell us what, in your opinion, and you can use any criteria you want, you don't have to listen to what the critics say or what anybody else says but yourself, what, in your opinion, was the worst game of 2007, the game that everybody should stay the hell away from?
3201247	3203930	Please, stay the hell away of this one game.
3204090	3207593	I swear to you, it's free, but it's not even more free.
3208334	3209034	Yaris for the 360.
3210168	3210948	Just stay away.
3211008	3214109	Toyota Yaris on the 360, the worst game of 2007.
3214569	3217450	Free and the robotic claw didn't do anything for you?
3218210	3218970	Oh, my God.
3219150	3220770	I want my time back.
3220850	3221630	I don't want my money.
3221650	3223091	I want my time back for that.
3224191	3227152	Best game of 2007 in your opinion, Raven?
3227692	3228112	Just one?
3228752	3229352	Just one.
3230032	3233653	You can tell us what some of your runner-ups would be, but we just want to know your number one game.
3233673	3234753	That's the only one we're writing down.
3235313	3235693	Let's see.
3235713	3237054	I guess I'll go with Galaxy.
3237234	3238054	I really enjoy that.
3240219	3240960	I really enjoy it.
3241800	3248464	It's one of those games that just shows off the Wii and just puts everything in a nice package going, Nintendo did something.
3249125	3251426	Anything kind of close for you?
3252547	3255489	Oh, there's a lot of things close, like Bioshock and Call of Duty 4.
3255569	3256950	You can't complain with those.
3257530	3259552	Overall, was it a good year for games, Raven's Dolphin?
3260152	3261793	Overall, it's a great year for games.
3262033	3263934	I compare it to 2004.
3264555	3265295	What was so hot about 2004?
3265335	3265575	Remind us.
3267355	3274339	We had Grand Theft Auto, San Andreas, we had Halo 2, we had Half-Life 2, we had God of War 1.
3275219	3276600	All those games came out in that year.
3277040	3277381	Alright.
3277921	3280682	Well, Raven Stolten, thanks so much for reflecting on the year with us.
3280722	3281663	We appreciate it, alright?
3282383	3283704	Thank you for having me on.
3283844	3284945	You are welcome, sir.
3285065	3285905	And best of luck in 2008.
3285965	3288367	We'll continue to hear from you in the year, right?
3288907	3289307	You bet.
3289427	3290188	Alright, take care, buddy.
3290208	3290268	Bye.
3291510	3297596	If you want to give us a call and help us out in March and April, give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
3297636	3302861	Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
3303281	3306164	I'm trying to look at some of the comments in the chat room here.
3306224	3309867	DarkZombie says, I demand Yaris 2 for Xbox Live Arcade.
3311048	3313371	Shadowslayer says, Bubble Bobble is the best game ever.
3313431	3314752	I'm assuming he means the original.
3316272	3316973	Not the newer one.
3317473	3320435	Let's go to the phones and see who's going to join us for the next part of the show.
3320495	3321496	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
3321516	3321896	Who's this?
3323438	3324979	This is DJ Dark Knight in the house.
3325539	3326780	Hey, DJ Dark Knight.
3326820	3327761	How are you doing, my friend?
3328721	3329122	I'm alright.
3329162	3330362	How about y'all guys?
3330703	3331683	I am excellent.
3332224	3336167	So, Dark Knight, are you ready to reflect on some of the previous months here in 2007?
3336207	3341470	Yeah, I wanted to kind of follow up on that bubble ball thing, but it might be a little bit later on.
3341771	3342151	Go ahead, sir.
3342171	3342631	There was another...
3346303	3350525	Number DS game that had that same problem, and it was SNK vs. Capcom Carfighters.
3350645	3354487	Yeah, the one card that wouldn't... Yeah, I remember that.
3354507	3357268	You couldn't get past the thing because the game would lock up or something.
3357288	3360149	Like a card didn't... Yeah, a card froze the game or something.
3360169	3360650	That's right.
3360690	3364832	So it was interesting that that Bubble Bobble thing kind of started a trend, sadly.
3365192	3366792	Yeah.
3367113	3369994	That one really hurt everybody for a while.
3370205	3370906	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3383542	3385483	This happened a little bit before.
3385603	3389624	The details were leaked before the Game Developers Conference.
3389704	3393905	But episode 222, the first week of March, was when we really started getting the details on PlayStation Home.
3394425	3399226	And I think the thing about PlayStation Home was it kind of made our collective jaws drop a little bit.
3399546	3405087	Because at this point, a lot of us had really written off the PlayStation 3 as the joke of this generation.
3405627	3409968	And then when PlayStation Home was announced, a lot of us kind of turned our heads and went, Really?
3410949	3411349	Really now?
3411389	3412229	This looks interesting.
3412779	3413660	Yeah, it looks interesting.
3413680	3414760	Wish it would come out now.
3415601	3415861	Yeah.
3416101	3416542	Someday.
3416902	3421645	Of course, now as we know, the damn thing still hasn't come out, but as I said before, I think Sony's spreading themselves too thin.
3421986	3427049	I think Home is still a great idea, and I can't wait to see it in 2008 or whenever it finally comes out.
3427850	3428890	Yeah.
3428930	3433173	Dark Knight, do you think PlayStation Home is worthy of selling PlayStation 3s?
3434054	3434474	I don't know.
3434514	3436976	I mean, it's a good idea.
3437216	3438017	They try to...
3439179	3444064	I don't think it'll work.
3444104	3446667	I don't think it'll do much good.
3447628	3449730	We'll see in 2008 when the thing finally comes out.
3449750	3461962	People like making their avatars and stuff, and to be honest, I wish Home was something that Nintendo was doing with the Miis, because I think that would've really launched that con- I mean, not that they really need any help selling the console, but
3462329	3463830	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3491369	3503874	and at the Game Developers Conference, I believe, Microsoft announced that they were going to be upping the arcade limit, which allowed some more titles to come out that were much bigger, such as Castlevania Symphony of the Night, I believe, was the first one that broke the 50 meg limit.
3503894	3505254	It was something like 90 megs.
3506095	3514338	And obviously the memory card sizes had to be upgraded as well, which I certainly don't think anybody sees this as a bad decision by Microsoft.
3514378	3515898	It was probably one they should have made a while ago.
3516699	3520500	Why they ever limited it in the first place was a little weird, but I guess it was because of the memory cards.
3521340	3525644	Yeah, because, I mean, and I don't think that many people actually bought them, like, talking about it.
3525664	3530028	I think most of the people bought the 512 one only because it came with Geometry Wars in it.
3531229	3532290	Oh, I guess that's a good point.
3532570	3536274	Or, you know, you just, you have the core and the memory card's all you need.
3536354	3546603	Like, you know, I think most of the hardcore gamers like you and I and probably most of the people that, you know, seek out gaming podcasts and therefore listen to this program, we probably all understand why you need a hard drive.
3547253	3558297	But for those people that bought their Xbox 360s just so they could play Madden, you know, have it be their party machine, I suppose, you know, memory cards are what they're going to buy because that's what they're used to from PlayStation.
3559057	3559877	Right, right.
3560958	3568380	And plus, like I said, the last system, I remember the other system I had that had a hard drive in it was the Sega Saturn.
3568980	3573802	So it was kind of like a take back when I saw that the 360, the newer systems would have that.
3574545	3575906	What about the old school Xbox though?
3575926	3578428	The first Xbox, they all had hard drives built in.
3579068	3579689	Oh yeah, that's right.
3579729	3581029	I forgot they did.
3581310	3582711	Xbox One had a hard drive.
3583531	3588414	Ironically enough, Xbox One didn't really use the hard drive though like it should have.
3588815	3598201	It almost seems like Microsoft when they originally conceptualized the original Xbox wanted to do some of the things from the very beginning that they didn't do until the Xbox 360.
3598321	3599402	It almost feels like that way.
3600211	3601613	I don't know, maybe it's just me.
3601653	3608423	I think most of the people use it just to record music, just use their music and play their CDs and whatnot and save it to the hard drive.
3608443	3609925	That's really all you could use it for.
3610706	3611047	Yeah.
3611628	3611788	Well...
3612708	3613008	Don't fake.
3613028	3613469	Don't fake.
3641974	3648456	And the reason why I picked that is not necessarily the announcement itself, but all the fallout.
3648776	3664662	The backlash that came from that because it definitely kind of showed, you know, A, can the independent media be trusted and who are these guys and da-da-da, and kind of B, you know, when Namco, obviously, you know, as most people know, it's not a very big secret now.
3664702	3667123	Now that the game's out, I think we can talk a little more openly about this.
3667143	3667263	Yeah.
3667583	3680554	Namco put the smacketh down a little bit and there wasn't a lot we could do because we are an independent organization because this is something that is run out of our spare times and because the fact these you know we don't have the
3681368	3683009	and many more.
3705925	3710372	They was up in arms about it and Sony was like, okay, okay, okay, we'll bend, we bend, we bend.
3710752	3711173	But it hurt.
3711213	3711494	It was just...
3714671	3716492	Nothing's worse than a community scorn.
3716672	3721976	But unfortunately, we don't have that same oomph that Kotaku has.
3722036	3723156	It just kind of sucks.
3723256	3727159	But it definitely was a very interesting thing to watch.
3727199	3729820	I'm sure it was a hell of a thing to see from the inside.
3729860	3733843	I'm sure on the outside it was probably pretty interesting too.
3733863	3736044	Like I said, I do my own show.
3736064	3738146	I'm kind of sketchy on most of the release news.
3738226	3738526	I'm like...
3738926	3739406	You're going to jail.
3739426	3740027	You're going to jail.
3740087	3742148	You're going to jail.
3765743	3767925	Views and opinions expressed by Loki, please don't sue us.
3769627	3778876	Episode number 225, there was one more episode that came out in March, and that was the episode where Devil May Cry 4 was announced that it will no longer be a PlayStation 3 exclusive.
3779296	3782880	And obviously that had a big impact because that kind of left...
3783320	3792165	Metal Gear Solid 4, and Final Fantasy XIII is the only real AAA, Super Grade A, PlayStation 3 exclusives left.
3792225	3794987	I mean, this was huge the week that this one was announced.
3795307	3799990	Because it was like, oh my gosh, one of the big three just jumped ship, and it's now going to be Xbox 360.
3800390	3808395	And now, flashing forward to where we're at now, not only is it also coming out on the Xbox 360, but they're making bundles out of it in Japan.
3808675	3810716	The whole Devil May Cry bundles now are coming out.
3811397	3814020	Devil May Cry for 360 if he doesn't get one.
3816442	3817263	I mean, don't get me wrong.
3817323	3818645	I saw a preview of the game in it.
3819165	3819946	It's going to look good.
3822068	3823170	It does look pretty awesome.
3823210	3824030	I'm going to have to check it out.
3824050	3828555	I've never really followed the Devil May Cry series that closely, but this game may have to make me change my mind.
3828775	3830778	It has one thing going for it so far.
3831318	3832319	The return of Trish.
3834372	3835133	Jamie's happy.
3835733	3848798	Alright, well, Dark Knight, out of those four stories, the unveiling of PlayStation Home, Microsoft upping the arcade limit, beautiful Katamari being spoiled by us, and Devil May Cry 4 no longer being a PlayStation 3 exclusive, which one do you think had the most impact in 2007?
3849078	3854920	I said Katamari spoiler thing, because like I said, it was just basically...
3856325	3884175	I open it to everybody to let them know that yeah, this really not only can affect the big guys but it can affect the minor guys and leak a story like that and have somebody go no, you might want to and I know because of our announcement those sales of Katamari have been so horrible just because of our announcement you know what's weird I actually wouldn't have picked the same story myself I wouldn't have, I would have went with the Devil May Cry story but that's alright
3884778	3889360	I mean, like I said, when I heard the aftermath about it, I was stunned.
3889460	3890640	I was like, wow.
3892221	3896302	But it did kind of show that y'all had enough clout to get that much attention.
3897543	3897863	All right.
3898263	3899164	Well, there you have it.
3899864	3901204	Loki, DarkSakura, do you agree?
3901484	3902845	Was that the biggest story in March?
3903025	3904205	Were we the biggest story in March?
3904245	3905506	Are we just being egotistical here?
3907423	3909445	I agree, actually, with the Devil May Cry thing.
3909865	3911407	You think Devil May Cry was a weird story?
3911567	3913009	I don't care about Devil May Cry 4.
3913129	3917114	I'm like, yeah, Devil May Cry 4 is on 360 and PS3.
3917354	3918035	Oh, good for them.
3919076	3925964	I think that it's more or less the total public recognition by another company that
3926400	3929281	Well, maybe the PlayStation 3 is a piece of shit.
3929641	3930881	That's what it was for me, too.
3930921	3932581	I wouldn't word it that strongly, but yes.
3933322	3934942	We want people to actually buy our game.
3935462	3937103	So we're going to put it on a system that people are buying.
3937283	3939103	I think that's what it was for me.
3939483	3944684	That's the way I would phrase it, is that it was really a company kind of acknowledging, Sony ain't selling the way we thought it would.
3945064	3947085	We're going to have to go put this game out on Microsoft as well.
3947105	3948525	Or they figured out, hey, guess what?
3948705	3953406	It isn't that hard to develop for the 360 and the PlayStation 3 at the same time.
3953766	3955027	Pretty easy to port the code over.
3955247	3955847	Let's do that.
3956624	3957084	Exactly.
3957404	3957744	All right.
3957864	3964827	I would throw a bonus one in and say basically Stranglehold having so much expectation it ended up being a bust.
3964847	3965407	Oh, that's right.
3965427	3966748	Stranglehold was released in March.
3966768	3967548	I remember that.
3967928	3968688	No, it wasn't.
3969029	3969329	Was it?
3969549	3970589	I think it was in March or later.
3970609	3972850	I think it was in September and October.
3973050	3973410	Was it?
3973610	3973850	Yeah.
3974090	3976131	But it seemed like this game, like it was at E3.
3976171	3978472	We first saw it at E3 like a year and a half ago.
3979324	3987289	I think it was supposed to be like a release title for the 360 at one point the way they showed it.
3987349	3990250	It probably was originally supposed to come out in March and got delayed that whole time.
3990871	3992972	That might be true, but... Alright, well anyway.
3993332	3994413	Let's talk about April.
3995074	4004916	Episode 226 kicked off April, and one of the top stories from that episode was the announcement that Sonic and Mario were going to be teaming up for a new game, Mario and Sonic at the Olympics.
4005477	4006617	And nobody cared.
4006857	4008657	Well, hold on.
4009077	4015819	Now they don't, because after the game came out, I don't think most people cared anymore, but the week this was announced, this was huge news.
4016179	4019160	That's kind of why I bring this up, because people were like, OMG, Sonic and Mario...
4019480	4023663	But now, you know, obviously since then we've had Sonic be announced in Brawl and all that stuff too.
4024063	4030788	You know, it's not such a big deal, but at the time it was like, OMG, my childhood, you know, fantasies in some way.
4031028	4033449	Or, you know, the thing you never thought would happen is happening.
4033489	4034930	Sonic and Mario in the same game.
4035771	4035931	True.
4036632	4037292	That was a big announcement.
4037662	4038142	Episode 227 in April
4056974	4058355	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4082558	4086240	and then like the Drum Mania Guitar Freaks thing.
4086280	4091763	Right, and I think that's what it was for me is that, you know, obviously you had Guitar Freaks, Drum Mania, Keyboard Mania in the arcades years ago.
4091884	4097207	It just kind of surprised me that it was like, whoa, somebody's actually going to try and do this in the U.S.
4097267	4101209	and they are going to put it all in one game and they're going to put it all in one box and see if it sells.
4101329	4104051	That is fucking ambitious right there.
4104151	4109234	And the ultimate kicker was they added, they had a singing part to it.
4110720	4111640	That was the ultimate kicker.
4111800	4115622	The ultimate breakdown was that you put singing into it.
4115962	4118263	It was like a big deal.
4118963	4120664	Especially with the popularity of karaoke games.
4121364	4123665	Hey, Loki, sing it.
4124185	4125385	Episode number 228.
4125846	4128267	A story that definitely stuck out for us in episode 228.
4128787	4134449	A woman who played on the game World of Warcraft posted an ad on Craigslist offering sex...
4135433	4137816	to get the gold to buy her epic mount.
4154122	4157024	I would be curious what that woman's up to now.
4157304	4158544	Like, did she do it again?
4158604	4159985	I got on top of that, actually.
4160425	4161706	I think I've never talked about it.
4161926	4164047	How about once, I mean, but it probably has happened.
4164568	4168650	An Australian lady met a young teenager online through WoW.
4169450	4172652	Paid her way to Content America to visit him.
4174033	4175093	I do remember hearing about this.
4175133	4177734	I think we might have covered this on the show, but yeah, it's similar.
4177774	4179575	It's a similar story in some ways.
4180256	4182437	It's crazy what some people get into on WoW.
4183211	4187374	But you know, I gotta say, as a World of Warcraft player, those epic mounts really are a bitch to get.
4187434	4189715	I mean, I almost am ready to put out to get one.
4190255	4192597	And that's why I don't touch that game.
4193137	4193718	Not really, though.
4193738	4194238	I'm just kidding.
4194578	4198561	Alright, and then episode 229 was the last episode we taped in April.
4199041	4205165	It actually must have been a slow news week, because the top story I pulled from that one is that the PlayStation Eye was officially announced.
4205585	4210528	But actually, I think the reason why this is relevant is because obviously, you know, a lot of us are kind of wondering, you know,
4211534	4218319	Sony showed this off at E3 and it disappeared for the longest time.
4218359	4223563	We never heard anything about the Eye of Judgment and then suddenly out of nowhere, bam, here it is, the PlayStation Eyes coming out.
4223823	4226005	And I think this might have been the episode where Loki made the bet.
4226065	4226625	I don't remember.
4226826	4227626	It might have been over the summer.
4228066	4229708	No, it was later.
4229908	4232770	But regardless, the PlayStation Eye was officially announced in episode 229.
4232810	4233130	I mean, like...
4236036	4238944	It just, it seemed like the news was pretty slow.
4239004	4244499	I think, I'm trying to remember when I debuted because I think I did, I think I was working on that one.
4244519	4244920	I was like...
4245529	4251831	Out of those four stories, Sonic and Mario team up, Rock Band announced, a woman in World of Warcraft puts out for her mount, and the PlayStation Eye officially announced.
4251911	4254492	What do you think had the biggest impact in gaming from April?
4254512	4254552	Uh...
4267737	4281732	I would probably have to say at first I was thinking about Mario and Sonic thing but to be honest I think the World of Warcraft thing just be on the grounds of it involves sex for fake money.
4283266	4284708	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4298436	4304017	Other than what happened later on in the years that made it worse and brought everything back ahead again.
4304498	4313340	I think the reason why that is important to gaming in general in 2007, because I think 99.9% of people looked at that story and went, I don't want that to be me, ever.
4314020	4317681	Like, even the most hardcore gamers were like, I do not want that to be me, ever.
4317801	4318181	Exactly.
4318201	4321002	It was a way to keep us in check.
4321122	4322022	But here's the kicker, though.
4322042	4322382	Yeah.
4323138	4332701	I hate to bring politics into this, but I don't know if y'all heard, but apparently a presidential candidate done scheduled a parade in WoW.
4334502	4335782	Wait, this is recent?
4336802	4337743	I think this is recent.
4338063	4338743	Ron Paul.
4339463	4340363	Riffing.
4341044	4341684	Interesting.
4342344	4345005	Ron Paul, apparently he got some people to...
4345612	4364911	or somebody might set it up, I don't know apparently he got, they're gonna do like a little um, campaigning parade on WoW I forgot what, things from Ironforge to some area and what not and I was like, wow they definitely they definitely having the goal to go for this one I remember jokingly said um
4365854	4368155	Great, if this pulls off, they're going to win the nerd vote.
4368615	4368935	Wow.
4369055	4371036	You know what?
4371056	4371996	2008 is going to be a hell of a year.
4372056	4376697	Honestly, this is about as cool as Dr. Evil in Austin Powers.
4377057	4377418	I'm hip.
4377558	4378018	I'm cool.
4378158	4378338	See?
4378358	4378498	Aw.
4383311	4385132	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4400098	4402381	You know, somebody like, you know, Hillary Clinton.
4402561	4404023	You know, she's a big presidential candidate.
4404063	4406165	She's pissed a lot of people off with her stance.
4406205	4408207	And she kind of, remember, she backtracked.
4408267	4410590	Like earlier in the year, she was kind of more anti-video game.
4410610	4416276	And then she kind of came out and supported the ESRB a little later and said, you know, we've done a lot of work and da-da-da.
4416356	4417577	It was very interesting.
4417637	4418638	And then when Manhunt 2 happened, she went back.
4418658	4420080	I won't say anything for your vote.
4423038	4426600	All I can say is 2008 is going to be a hell of a year with the election going on and everything.
4427881	4429222	Dark Knight, let's hear it.
4429302	4431963	What do you think, in your opinion, was the worst game of 2007?
4432043	4435826	I had to agree with Raven's Dolphin and it was Yars.
4436806	4438567	I played it once and never touched it again.
4438587	4443450	I basically gave it the what the hell was I smoking when I played this game award.
4444891	4450255	Well, in your opinion, what was the hands down, above all, best freaking game of 2007?
4452115	4461101	So many games, but I had to go with Call of Duty 4 because the game could basically be turned into a movie by itself.
4461461	4464383	You wouldn't need no actors or anything like that.
4464823	4468826	Just put the game in, let it run its course, it's the Oscar hit.
4468986	4472348	I think as I've heard somebody describe Call of Duty 4, it's just fucking epic.
4473449	4473809	It is.
4473989	4474870	It's just fucking epic.
4476271	4479593	Best person to ask about that, talk to Travis.
4480333	4480714	He's a veteran.
4482428	4483028	He's a veteran.
4483388	4483889	He'll tell you.
4508212	4509212	Like I said, I was there.
4509232	4512493	Trust me, I was part of that shenanigans, that episode.
4513513	4514053	Lots of fun.
4514213	4514653	Good times.
4515054	4517814	Well, Dark Knight, we got to let you go, but thanks so much for participating tonight.
4517934	4519274	Have a great 2008, all right?
4519795	4520535	Thank you for having me on.
4520555	4521395	Y'all guys do the same.
4521415	4521855	Take care.
4521995	4522435	Take care, buddy.
4523175	4523355	Bye.
4524196	4524596	All right.
4524856	4525636	Dark Knight there.
4525896	4527456	Let's see if we get somebody else to join us.
4527516	4530117	Talk about, we're going to do May and June.
4530137	4533918	I know it's a little different from what we have there, but since we're giving everybody two months, we'll go ahead and do May and June.
4533938	4534818	We got somebody on the line.
4534858	4535398	Hi, who's there?
4536400	4537821	Yo, it's Xenocore from the Ultimate Quest.
4537841	4538201	How you guys doing?
4538221	4539402	What is up, Xenocore?
4539422	4540042	How you doing?
4540982	4542883	I'm still alive, you know, paying bills and such.
4543243	4543944	How was your holiday?
4543984	4544224	Good?
4545184	4545905	I got two shirts.
4547205	4548266	I got clothes, too.
4549166	4550127	Yeah, man.
4550187	4550827	Clothing is good.
4550987	4551427	That's right.
4551447	4553068	It keeps you warm during these cold months.
4553549	4556110	Christmas is intended to give you underwear and socks.
4557270	4558731	How are things over at the Ultimate Quest?
4559011	4560512	Are you guys doing your own year-end wrap-up?
4561700	4563561	Yeah, we pretty much finished our shows for the year.
4563601	4567223	We're going on hiatus for the new year, so I can get inebriated at least.
4569265	4571226	But we'll be picking up next year, I think.
4572509	4574410	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4597479	4598219	Thank you for watching!
4619588	4620629	Yeah, that's pretty cool.
4620669	4622269	I'll be sure to pass that message along.
4622389	4635175	I thought Footy would get a kick out of that, because sometimes, you know, Argentina is a huge fucking country, but it doesn't get mentioned enough, usually, and, you know, because the gaming scene just isn't what it is here or there, you know what I mean?
4636075	4640037	It's very different, as he lets us know very much so on the show.
4640437	4642378	Alright, well, enough about people who aren't here.
4642478	4648341	Let's talk about the year in review, and talk a little bit about, did you kill the fly, Loki?
4649361	4650202	There's another one, though.
4679986	4681307	Yeah, man, mutton's good for you.
4681527	4688472	Oh my gosh, and PETA, understandably, was pissed off about that, and the rest of us were wondering, what the F were they thinking?
4689493	4696778	I don't think they actually killed the goat live, but they had the dead goat, like, everywhere, and it was just kind of like, what the crap were you people thinking?
4698919	4700340	Yeah, it was pretty humorous.
4700420	4703542	It's like, didn't he at least make mutton or stew out of it or anything?
4703562	4705824	He just had a dead carcass right there, smelling of the place?
4706104	4706684	Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
4707385	4707665	Awesome.
4708446	4710148	Oh, FootyMonster's actually in chat.
4710188	4713332	He just said something about Guido.
4713352	4713812	That's funny.
4715254	4715774	Anyway, sorry.
4715954	4716575	I got distracted.
4716655	4717356	Alright, episode number 231.
4717576	4720099	Hey, you'd like this as a roleplay fan.
4720912	4727794	One of the stories that stuck out from episode 231, Final Fantasy 4 was announced that it was going to be remade for the DS.
4728094	4737716	This is much different from what Squeenix had been doing with the past Final Fantasy games and releasing them, but they were going to remake all of Final Fantasy 4 similar to how they did with Final Fantasy 3.
4738756	4740497	And now the game is out in Japan.
4740537	4747338	We're still waiting for it here in the U.S., but certainly had people thinking different ways about that.
4747378	4749499	What do you think about the Final Fantasy 4 remake on the DS?
4750729	4755552	I'm all for the remakes when they switch to another console that wasn't on previously.
4755572	4758694	They're just going to print more money once it gets released over there.
4759181	4760022	Thanks for watching!
4782798	4786041	and I'm just like, please, please, Square Enix, do not fuck this up.
4786081	4790164	But then when I saw the screen caps and the previews, I'm like, wow, this actually looks pretty awesome.
4791045	4791445	Yep.
4791685	4793046	Kane's Dragoon jump for the win.
4793306	4796209	Yeah, looking for... Ooh, it's going to be great.
4796229	4800452	Episode 232, big week for PC gamers because that was the week that StarCraft II was announced.
4801420	4805124	and Blizzard reviving one of their franchises that had been a little bit dormant.
4805304	4813652	I mean, obviously we had the rumors of StarCraft Ghost years ago and everybody kind of thought, you know, this had to come eventually and finally it arrived in May, the announcement of StarCraft 2.
4815974	4820458	Episode 233 was the one we taped live at Fanime and that was the week
4821918	4822979	Super Smash Bros.
4823079	4823460	Brawl
4850467	4853989	That's a rough one, because it is getting quite a lot of hype.
4855010	4861394	Whenever I start seeing games advertised this much, I just expect it to fall short a certain degree.
4861454	4866998	Just from process of elimination over the years, whenever a game gets hyped up, it always falls short one or two spots.
4867899	4870660	If it does, I'm going to be surprised, but if it does not, then all the better.
4871961	4879066	Especially if it is true what Loki said earlier, and it does turn to be true that the game gets delayed another month, it's going to have to be that much better.
4879895	4881076	to make it worth the wait.
4881536	4885558	Yeah, that's a first-party game, so it's not going to get released when it's complete crap.
4885598	4886118	There's no way.
4886238	4886838	True, true.
4887199	4894282	Well, okay, out of those stories, PETA and the God of War Go, Final Fantasy IV Remake, StarCraft II announced, and Super Smash Bros.
4894322	4897564	Revealed, what do you think was the story that had the biggest impact in gaming?
4897664	4900045	Or if you have something else you want to throw in there, go for it.
4900785	4910337	No, mainly I'd go with the story with the Guard of War carcass just because it spills over to mainstream media when you see stuff like that and it brings attention to the gaming world.
4910497	4911738	And not the good kind of attention.
4912940	4914782	Yeah, it's definitely bad attention.
4915363	4916344	I have to agree with you there.
4916384	4917786	That's probably what I would pick too.
4918450	4919451	Definitely would pick that one.
4919771	4920932	Alright, well, let's move on to June.
4920972	4922533	We only taped three shows in June.
4922553	4923254	I don't know what happened.
4923274	4924475	I guess we fell asleep.
4924855	4926417	Or maybe another Disneyland trip happened in there.
4926437	4926877	I'm not sure.
4926897	4927598	It was a Disneyland trip.
4927618	4927958	Was there?
4928038	4929799	Alright, well, there were three shows taped in June.
4930180	4935944	Episode 234, that was the week, I love this, that was the week that Ubisoft apologized for making crappy Wii games.
4936525	4937426	Do you remember that one?
4937726	4940768	That they said, you know what, maybe we shouldn't have done so many ports.
4942910	4946393	Just to have a game company, even though, you know, obviously, this was
4946752	4946852	3Speak
4971840	4973501	Finally, that was launched in June of 2007.
4974041	4976763	And obviously, Sony had been kind of trying to catch up.
4977503	4981105	You might remember from the year before, All I Want for Xmas is a PSP.com.
4981925	4982626	Yeah, I remember that one.
4982646	4984186	Didn't go so well that time.
4985147	4989409	And so, most people were saying, you know what, Sony really needs like a Major Nelson.
4989449	4993872	You know, Nintendo has their poster kids with Miyamoto and Reggie Fils-Aimé.
4994172	4999034	You know, Microsoft has, you know, Major Nelson and Trixie and people that are out there in the community.
4999434	5000175	Sony's got...
5000928	5002469	Crazy Crayon Eatin' Ken.
5004229	5006630	If they hired me, I bet you I could sell PS3s.
5007311	5008471	How would you sell a PlayStation 3?
5008971	5011852	First of all, I'd restore it to its original format.
5012793	5016414	But I would have it with all of the goody stuff and a 40 gig hard drive.
5017074	5019715	It would not have even had the option of having more.
5019735	5020356	How would you sell it?
5020376	5021436	What would that commercial look like?
5021736	5022316	With boobs.
5023637	5025658	Just women jumping on trampolines?
5026298	5027718	Is that what it would be?
5028099	5028779	It is going to have...
5029412	5032634	No, you can have graphics this realistic on your PlayStation 3.
5033614	5034014	Oh, my God.
5034475	5036896	Okay, that is a brilliant idea for a commercial.
5037536	5045540	Just all the commercial is is 30 seconds of boobs on trampolines, and then in the very last second, it says, generated by PlayStation 3.
5045580	5047821	This is all real footage.
5047841	5049682	Sounds like Jamie should be working for Spike TV.
5050943	5052103	Perhaps she should.
5053424	5057866	Or have like a show like Barbecue.
5059042	5062005	Because nothing will sell a game like boobs and barbecue.
5063907	5067511	Macman says in the chatroom, Jamie would just tape a ferret to every PlayStation 3.
5067551	5070094	Free ferret with every game.
5070154	5073637	And Dark Knight wants to remember, how did that crayon-eating bit even start?
5073878	5074198	Megsie.
5075031	5075592	That's right.
5075732	5077974	One of the OR lesbians started the Crayote thing.
5077994	5078814	That's right.
5078874	5080596	Captain Crayola, Star Tetsuya says.
5080936	5081156	All right.
5081176	5085680	Well, anyhow, out of those three stories, or if you have one of your own, Xenocore, Ubisoft apologizes.
5085741	5086882	Sony launches their own blog.
5086902	5087242	Oh, I'm sorry.
5087262	5088443	I didn't even read the third one.
5088843	5093928	Episode 236 was the week that Manhunt 2 officially got the AO rating.
5094408	5097371	And, of course, this just began weeks upon weeks of
5098322	5099403	ManHunt2 ManHunt2
5115962	5120948	So out of those three stories, Ubisoft apologizing, Sony launching their official blog, and Manhunt 2 getting the ratings.
5121008	5121809	Unicor, what do you think?
5122109	5123050	Biggest impact?
5123131	5124672	It's got to be the Manhunt 2 story.
5125073	5127576	That went all across the globe on that one.
5127676	5129058	Hands down, absolutely.
5129662	5131444	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5153703	5161668	You can use pee as a... I don't... I always think... I think back to when I watched Survivor years ago and there was the guy... For snake bites.
5161748	5166331	There was the guy going, the stingray just bit me, I need someone to pee on it.
5166391	5170774	And so this lady goes over, squats on him and pees on it, and sure enough, disinfects it.
5170814	5176237	But it's really better with your own pee because it breaks down the proteins in the toxin.
5176477	5178979	I just remember the guy saying, I need someone to pee on it!
5179359	5181320	Meat tenderizer works too for the same thing.
5182061	5182321	Anyhow...
5183428	5185211	Xenocore, what was the worst freaking game of 2007?
5199369	5201671	I mean, it's too easy of a target.
5201711	5204353	I was trying to think of something else, but nothing comes to mind.
5204573	5205474	Yaris needs to go.
5206074	5209877	Whoever developed it needs to have their names published so they can't get another job in the aiming industry.
5209897	5211078	It's as simple as that.
5211378	5213139	Three out of three have named Yaris.
5213259	5215241	I have a pick, and it's not Yaris.
5216141	5217963	See, I can't think of another one.
5217983	5218924	There's another one out there.
5218964	5225548	I was actually going to tell you, the last issue of Xbox Magazine was listing Yaris as a piece of crap.
5226369	5228210	The official Xbox Magazine, even.
5228291	5228811	How sad.
5229244	5229704	How's that?
5229965	5231686	Alright, well, let's get to the good stuff, Xenocore.
5231706	5234308	In your opinion, the best freaking game of 2007.
5234508	5239032	Okay, I'll probably get more hate mail for that, but it gives me more to read on the show.
5239472	5242895	But I've got to say Portal is the best game of the year.
5244856	5245597	Why Portal?
5245697	5248799	I'm surprised that I was waiting to write Persona 3.
5249220	5252842	As an RPG player, I would have thought that was going to be your pick, but why Portal?
5253603	5255484	Because it's the most innovative title.
5255504	5255665	Period.
5255765	5256245	Period.
5256781	5259483	Everybody else is doing something that's been done before.
5259763	5263826	As good as Super Mario Galaxy is, Ratchet and Clank beat them to the market with it.
5263926	5266007	Rather or not, they've developed it already.
5266787	5268749	Bioshock was a big disappointment for me.
5268829	5270830	It was good in the beginning, but it sucked at the end.
5271090	5272391	In hindsight, it's like, what?
5273011	5273772	What's all this stuff?
5274332	5275513	I threw Bioshock to the side.
5276093	5278335	The others just didn't make a big of an impact as Portal.
5278415	5279996	I can still go back and play Portal now.
5280373	5281573	So, Portal gets the win.
5281734	5282554	You never know, Xenocore.
5282574	5284695	We're going to be recapping our picks later in the show.
5284755	5288796	And I'll bet you at least one of the three of us agrees with you that Portal was the best game of 2007.
5290357	5291457	But we'll find out for sure.
5291497	5291837	You never know.
5291917	5293598	Surprises, there are many.
5293978	5295138	So, we'll get to that a little later in the show.
5295158	5297959	But, Xenocore, thank you so much for joining us.
5298019	5300040	And we always have appreciated your calls throughout 2007.
5300500	5303701	Best of luck to you and the whole crew at the Ultimate Quest for 2008, all right?
5304642	5305062	No problem.
5305102	5305662	Thanks a lot, guys.
5305722	5306002	All right.
5306062	5306522	Take care, buddy.
5307263	5307563	Bye-bye.
5307883	5308143	Bye-bye.
5308666	5309187	DarkSakura.com
5332537	5336421	Classic Game of the Year Classic Game of the Year Classic Game of the Year
5354079	5355319	and let's hear it.
5355740	5358921	DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the year?
5359061	5363982	The classic game of the year is one of the best games ever in the universe.
5365002	5375126	It's Parodius da Shinwakara Owariye, which translates to Parodius from Myth to Laughter.
5376206	5379587	And the version that I have for our music is
5380387	5385091	is the PC Engine release of it.
5385471	5392777	Because honestly, and I've played through the Super Famicom one, it lags so badly.
5393377	5397040	It has bad flicker and slowdown because it's a lot of stuff to process.
5398341	5399762	The PC Engine did it better.
5399922	5405767	But this is, as you can probably tell from the name, Parodius is a parody of Gradius.
5407141	5408882	It actually is the second one in the series.
5408922	5413804	The first Parodius came out on the MSX system.
5414324	5420027	But in this one you get to play, you've actually got your different power-up abilities based on what character you pick.
5420367	5422388	You can play the Vic Viper from Gradius.
5422932	5423953	You can play an octopus.
5424233	5425974	You can play a twin bee.
5426274	5427995	This is the one where you fight the stripper.
5428895	5430916	They're the Vegas showgirl or whatever she is.
5431116	5431757	Oh, my God.
5431797	5432477	I remember this one.
5432977	5434178	By going in between her legs.
5436179	5438100	Now, why did Proteus never come out in the U.S.?
5438520	5439240	It came out in Europe.
5440301	5441161	But why never here?
5441241	5445023	Were we just not, I mean, the showgirl thing we just wanted to get?
5445103	5445964	Too far up their ass.
5447395	5452877	So basically, I mean, and for those of you that may be kind of looking at Jamie right now going, what the heck, why are you picking this type thing?
5453218	5455759	You really do have to imagine that this game is Gradius on crack.
5456299	5456559	Yeah.
5456719	5462342	And what makes this game so freaking epic is just the fact that I think it was mostly ignored here in the U.S.
5462382	5463702	But you had the Moai stage.
5464843	5467564	Because, you know, Konami games have to have the Moai head in there.
5467764	5468244	Absolutely.
5468264	5471966	But the way that the power-ups worked, I thought it was cool.
5471986	5474447	The Vic Viper is the old-school Gradius config.
5474867	5476968	The Octopus is the Salamander configuration.
5478413	5482776	Twinbee is the Twinbee configuration, even with the rocket with the punching fists.
5483997	5487019	And Pentaro is Gradius III.
5487559	5490881	I always would play as Twinbee because I love the rocket fists, but...
5491725	5496350	It's also really cool, and the one that we're watching is actually the big viper playing through, because you get the option and double and all that.
5496430	5497971	Yeah, let's just like Radius 2 when you play it that way.
5498371	5503276	And, um, the thing that, my favorite weapon in the whole thing... Maybe this is a reason why it didn't come out in the US.
5503296	5504157	Because of the eagle?
5504277	5512364	I noticed that the boss monster that's being fought right now is an American eagle, wearing a Yankee hat and a little bow tie, and just exploded.
5513165	5517309	Well, um, a little bit more, um, is that, uh,
5518363	5522067	One of your power-ups in the game is a bell, and you keep shooting the bell.
5522868	5529555	And if you get a blue bell, it'll make your character grow big and anything it touches will be destroyed.
5530075	5534960	If you get a green one, it's a big flare and destroys everything on the screen, including most bosses.
5536502	5538204	That's actually how you beat the naked lady.
5540042	5545565	One of the people that you fight is this woman wearing a sheet, and when you shoot her, she goes, oh, like that.
5546545	5548806	And she blows little angels at you in bubbles.
5550827	5553388	In fact, here's a picture of her on the wiki.
5553628	5554628	I'll get it in the chat room.
5554648	5555429	Nice, nice.
5557230	5563072	But she's really freaking hard to beat, so you usually have to have the mega flare by then, but they always give you a bell right before that stage.
5564293	5567434	My favorite of those is the gray bell, which shouts words.
5568556	5572218	Like, the whole phrases, like, you know, I think one of them is the equivalent of, like, Eat It Joes.
5572938	5574679	And another one is E equals MC squared.
5575999	5581241	And, um, now, this is actually not my favorite in the Parodius, um, series.
5581842	5586404	My favorite is, um, Jikyo Shibari Parodius, which, um, you can play on Saturn.
5586864	5591466	And that's the one that has, um, and for anyone who wants to know what it means, Chatting Parodius Live.
5593048	5602673	For anyone who wants to know it, it has the Miracle Oopa, it has the Penguins, Pentoro, and Hanako, Twinbee and Winbee, Viper and Lord British from Gradius.
5605154	5606675	Not to be confused with Richard Garriott.
5606855	5607055	No.
5607816	5610077	And it has some girls riding on a missile.
5612158	5619442	And now it has Aitsu and Koitsu, which for anyone who ever played Yu-Gi-Oh!, there's cards for them.
5620592	5624714	There are these little stickmen riding on paper airplanes.
5625455	5627236	But I just think that it's pretty cool.
5627276	5628616	It had so much stuff going on.
5628656	5635460	And the other one in the series was there was Sexy Proteus and Pyro Wars.
5636240	5647286	And I also saw last night and if you can hear on the thing a lot of the levels remix Gradius music to start or Salamander music and then play classical music.
5648867	5649007	Like
5650541	5659408	So, um, but, uh, last night I was looking at YouTube trying to find, you know, because we obviously play the sound off of YouTube that way.
5660209	5666894	Um, but I found the Proteus, um, uh, Pachinko machine videos.
5667215	5667495	Nice.
5667635	5674280	And one of the, there's even like this little model show with, uh, the, uh, the bunny suit girls.
5674441	5677283	It's girls in bunny outfits riding on missiles.
5678760	5682788	and then the showgirl was one of them stomping through the city.
5685228	5686328	It was just really cool.
5686348	5690770	I was like, so we at least still have the Proteus franchise still alive.
5690950	5692271	I would like to see a new Proteus.
5692511	5692991	Really bad.
5693011	5694131	Alright.
5694332	5696732	Or some folks in chat are saying Proteus on Virtual Console.
5697133	5701734	Especially with the fact that we do know they will put games that were once Japanese only.
5701774	5702855	They have been releasing over here.
5702915	5703915	Like Mario Bros.
5704195	5705076	2, the original.
5705136	5708737	Looks like if they have a problem with the eagle one, then bring out Oshaberry Proteus.
5708797	5709857	I don't think it was in there.
5709917	5712919	I think everybody is smart enough to just get over it.
5713179	5713819	I know, really.
5715182	5715682	It's not a big deal.
5716023	5721327	The reason why I like Oshinori Parodius is that one of the bad guys in it is actually supposed to be one of the girls from Tokimeki Memorial.
5722608	5723989	The long-term dating sim.
5724469	5724769	Nice.
5725170	5725430	Yeah.
5725710	5726471	Well, there it is, folks.
5726491	5728652	Your classic game of the year.
5729453	5731935	Parodius Da, in this case, on the PC Engine.
5732015	5734837	But, you know, it's out there for multiple systems.
5735658	5736858	So, very good pick, Jamie.
5736878	5738119	Thank you.
5738199	5739961	This game always cracks me up every time I watch it.
5739981	5741342	Because Gradius is an awesome game.
5741362	5743163	And where was this game in the Gradius collection?
5743423	5744144	That's what I would like to know.
5744426	5745346	I know, right?
5745547	5750669	But I think there was another... I actually want to say that all of them have been released on Saturn.
5751429	5752549	Except for the MSX one.
5753750	5757411	Well, coming up in Part B on tonight's program, we're going to get into the mailbag.
5757532	5762234	We're going to get into the next six months of the year, from July to December, recapping the top stories.
5762714	5769997	We're going to talk about release dates, or lack thereof, and our top five best and worst games of the year, as well as our predictions for 2008.
5770817	5772798	That's all coming up right after the break.
