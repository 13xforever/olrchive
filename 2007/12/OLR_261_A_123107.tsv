0	20040	Tonight, December 30th, 2007, on this special edition of Orange Lounge Radio, we take a
20040	28400	look back at the headlines and games of 2007 with our favorite people, all of our listeners.
28400	35320	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge
35320	36320	Radio.
36320	39880	I should say welcome back because we weren't here last week thanks to the holidays.
39880	46480	We are that video game program slash podcast slash live broadcast via Live 365 dedicated
46480	50240	to all things video games, video gaming, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle.
50240	51240	My name is Rob Roberts.
51240	56300	I'm here every week joined by my lovely co-host, the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers
56300	57300	is here.
57300	58300	Hi.
58300	59300	How are you?
59300	60840	I have a sinus infection.
60840	62640	Sorry to hear it.
62640	64120	You were sick quite a bit this year.
64120	65120	I'm sorry to hear.
65120	68160	I wasn't like sick, sick not like when I had the plague.
68160	69160	Right.
69160	71000	However, this is exactly how the plague started.
71000	72000	Oh no.
72000	75280	So, I hopped right on it and I have drugs that make me happy.
75280	76720	Well, I hope you feel better.
76720	78400	How was your week off?
78400	81400	Well, I did absolutely nothing.
81400	82400	That's good.
82400	87480	I sat on my ass and did absolutely nothing and it was beautiful.
87480	89000	Was Santa good to you?
89000	91000	Santa was decent.
91000	96200	Santa brought me, actually Santa Dan gave me a game that I sort of blinked and went
96200	99120	WTF over, but I think I'm going to play it.
99120	100120	What's that?
100120	101120	You care to share?
101120	102120	That was, what's it?
102120	103120	Flash Focus.
103120	104120	The vision training game.
104120	105120	Yeah.
105120	108360	So, I'm going to play it because clearly I need my vision trained.
108360	111480	Well, I hope it works for you.
111480	119080	Then I started and we, I gave him, what did I give him?
119080	120720	I gave him Blade Runner.
120720	121720	Cool.
121720	125080	And I bought him Ratatouille on Blu-ray.
125080	128720	For use on the Playstation 3 because that's your Blu-ray player too, right?
128720	129720	Very cool.
129720	130720	It's pretty.
130720	131720	Alright.
131720	132720	Pretty.
132720	133720	Well, we'll hear more about your game in a week in just a minute.
133720	134720	That's not a game.
134720	137360	Well, I know, but we'll get the other games as well, right?
137360	141320	Well, I got to introduce, he's sitting there waiting for me to say the one and only
141320	142760	tech master, Loki.
142760	144840	I'm not really waiting for you, but it's fine.
144840	146280	How are you doing tonight, Loki?
146280	147280	I'm doing fine.
147280	148280	Alright.
148280	149280	Good to hear.
149280	150280	And how was your Christmas?
150280	151280	Was Santa good to you?
151280	152280	I was good to me.
152280	153280	Were you?
153280	154280	Yeah.
154280	155280	Because I built a new computer.
155280	157760	Oftentimes we buy ourselves the best gifts, right?
157760	158760	Exactly.
158760	163360	Because I buy everything for myself, I don't normally get anything from everyone else because
163360	169960	they figure I've already bought it, which is usually the case, but I don't know.
169960	170960	Alright.
170960	174120	Well, tonight is going to be a little bit different because we're going to be doing
174120	175760	the year in review.
175760	180480	We're just kind of having a very informal, kind of a slow show tonight.
180480	184280	I got to say, I noticed that our chat room is not quite as hopping as it usually is over
184280	187700	at chat.orangelandrater.com, which has me a little worried because tonight's show is
187700	191400	supposed to be all about the listeners interacting with us and everything, but I do see, obviously
191400	194360	there are some people there chatting it up.
194360	200780	Tiger Claw wants to know, he's in chat, chat.orangelandrater.com, wants to know if Loki has heard that Black
200780	202500	Wolf bought the Eye of Judgment.
202500	203500	Good for him.
203500	209240	That's one more towards one million, which will never, ever, ever happen, ever.
209240	217160	And I remember, just to reiterate from two weeks ago, it has to sell a million some day.
217160	218160	Some day.
218160	222080	So yes, the bet was actually extended from six months to one million copies ever, and
222080	225440	then Loki will don the tingle suit and set fire to an Eye of Judgment.
225440	226440	Whenever that happens.
226440	231120	Which apparently he knows about because he actually mentioned on the show something about
231120	234080	Loki being one step closer to wearing the tingle suit.
234080	237920	So that kind of takes the fun out of it, but whatever, maybe he's waiting to YouTube it.
237920	238920	I don't know.
238920	241560	So I think Bobby's doing his own year-end show tonight.
241560	242560	It's probably still going.
242560	244820	That's probably where some of our listeners are, who knows?
244820	248460	But meanwhile, we actually are going to continue on doing the things we usually do.
248460	254680	We weren't here last week because of the holidays, so Merry Christmas, Kwanzaa, Hanukkah, Solstice,
254680	256640	Ramadan, whatever the hell it is you celebrate.
256640	257640	I hope it was good.
257640	259640	Or nothing at all, if you're atheist, right?
259640	260640	I hope it was good.
260640	261640	Whatever you did.
261640	262640	Ramadan is not until later in the year.
262640	264360	Oh, what am I mixing it up with?
264360	265360	Oh well.
265360	266360	Who knows?
266360	267360	Who cares?
267360	268360	Somebody cares.
268360	269360	Festivus.
269360	270360	Maybe it's Festivus.
270360	271360	Because they're so similar.
271360	274080	I'm just trying to be PC and not leave anybody out.
274080	275080	So there you have it.
275080	277200	Whatever it is you celebrate, I hope it was good.
277200	280480	Let's talk about our gaming weeks, because we do talk about that, or I guess I should
280480	282040	say, our gaming two weeks.
282040	284280	Dark Soccer, how was your gaming two weeks?
284280	287880	I got Orange Box, so I played some Portal.
287880	293520	I decided that I really like Half-Life 2, Episode 2, which Dan beat last night.
293520	301600	I played a lot of Pinball, and I played a lot of Ragnarok, run any server now, run the
301600	307060	Essence RO server, and they're better, and they don't go down randomly without putting
307060	309640	up a freaking announcement, why?
309640	312440	So I was going to say, so you've switched servers now.
312440	321160	I've jumped the ship, but not a shark, because I'm awesome.
321160	328800	And I've been trying to get back into playing some Final Fantasy VI, which I have on my
328800	329800	DS.
329800	330800	Very cool.
330800	336160	But I've really just been doing more Portal.
336160	340440	I can't play very much of it because I get sick, and, and, and, and, and Dan got me
340440	344520	a rock band, I said I was going to get it, and I did.
344520	345520	Very cool.
345520	350200	And our guitar broke the first day, so we've been using the Guitar Hero guitars, because
350200	351200	we have two.
351200	352200	Gotcha.
352200	355120	Well, we actually have a whole bunch of them, because Dan's friend Will, his stuff lives
355120	360760	at our house sometimes, and Dan got my Iron Lung just for me, and I can't say that I like
360760	361760	it.
361760	363080	I need to buy that.
363080	366120	And I wasn't in the same room listening to it, but it sounded like a cover.
366120	367360	Oh, it's not the original?
367360	373320	But the music is all dead on, just some, some of the covers just are like, no.
373320	378320	Well, maybe they didn't want to get sued like the Guitar Heroes 80s people did.
378320	381000	And I sang, I sang Creep, and I sang it the right way.
381000	382000	Did you?
382000	383000	The right way.
383000	385760	So you got the whole bundle then, you didn't just get the game itself, you got the mic
385760	386760	and the drums and everything.
386760	387760	We got everything.
387760	388760	That's nice.
388760	389760	We have, we have it all.
389760	390840	So when are we going to rock out?
390840	392080	You, me, and Loki have to make a band.
392080	393080	When are we going to rock out?
393080	396080	We're having it at, at our party tomorrow night.
396080	397080	Oh.
397080	399160	We have conflicting parties going on, sadly.
399160	400720	Every year, and I invite you every year.
400720	403800	Ironically enough, we're also probably going to be playing rock band.
403800	407560	Ironically enough, I believe Matt is bringing rock band to, uh, to cost us a rob.
407560	410560	I need a case for rock band.
410560	415520	Seriously, that box is just too big to carry around lugging that thing.
415520	418280	You need to get one of those nifty little cases.
418280	420640	Well, you know, I'll get around to it eventually.
420640	423600	Alright, well, Dark Soccer, you gotta come over at some point once all the party madness
423600	425160	is done and we'll rock out to some Radiohead.
425160	427800	Well, hey, I'm off work at least the next day.
427800	432360	I have to go to work tomorrow, which is both craptacular and full of sucktitude.
432360	434200	Sorry to hear it.
434200	437480	Uh, Dark Knight in Chat says, I would love to hear Jamie singing.
437480	440020	Any possibilities of YouTubes in the future?
440020	441020	Not on YouTube.
441020	442020	Not on YouTube?
442020	445480	If my, if my throat doesn't kill me and I'm drunk enough, maybe.
445480	446480	Alright.
446480	451680	Well, the whole, the whole problem is that every year I get a sinus infection without
451680	452680	fail.
452680	453680	This we all know.
453680	455760	But I always am sick on New Year's Eve.
455760	462200	I'm telling you, man, we need to get that video from Eddie that has fucking Iron Man
462200	463200	singing sabotage.
463200	464840	A rice princess doing sabotage.
464840	467020	Way better than me doing even Timmy.
467020	468020	It's hilarious.
468020	475480	Well, at any rate, I, I always get very, very drunk while I'm very, very sick, which is
475480	476980	pretty stupid.
476980	481280	And then they make me sing Karaoke Revolution and last year I tried to sing Snake Eater
481280	484880	and I had no voice.
484880	491400	I had no voice, so I was like, that's what it sounded like.
491400	497120	Um, actdeft is in chat and actdeft is, uh, um, saying that we should go out on tour.
497120	502300	He says the OLR world tour, the sensible world of podcasting tour, AKA the fag, your anger
502300	505860	tour, which is a inside joke from 2007 of course.
505860	506860	I like that.
506860	508260	The sensible world of podcasting tour.
508260	509260	That's a good name.
509260	510260	That's very cool.
510260	511260	Very good.
511260	512840	So, Logie, how was your gimme weed, Logie?
512840	517640	Um, well this week, or actually last week and the week before last, uh, I took some
517640	523440	time off to play games and let's see, I didn't play as much as I thought I would because
523440	529040	I ended up playing mostly Saints Bro because I'm trying to finish it, you know, months
529040	531760	after it's come out, but you know, trying to finish it.
531760	537260	I'm actually, according to the game, halfway through it, but I'm done with two of the storylines,
537260	538640	some on the last one.
538640	546240	And then, um, I played a little bit more Earth Defense Force 2017, and um, just now I have
546240	554120	to grind to get, you know, more HP I guess, because I get raped by all the ants and ships
554120	558320	and stuff on the last levels on Inferno, so the only way I can do that now is just to
558320	563480	get, you know, tons and tons and tons and tons of health, which is gonna be incredibly
563480	567880	boring to do, and um, so that'll be fun.
567880	577160	And then, let's see, I bought a new 360, so I was, you know, playing stuff on that, um,
577160	582380	I have my old 360 which I'm actually gonna fix, which is weird, um, because I think if
582380	587120	I replace the, um, they have the X-clamp on there that you can replace, the heatsink,
587120	591120	um, it should fix it because that, I hear something underneath the board that sounds
591120	595320	like, I don't know, like a ball bearing rolling around, and I think that's actually some of
595320	600200	the solder stripped off the board and actually kind of clumped up into a little ball, so
600200	606280	I'm guessing that some of the solder's probably, um, I don't know, shorting out the board somewhere,
606280	610960	so once I pull it all off we'll be able to see what's wrong, but apparently the X-clamp
610960	616920	fix or whatever is fixed about 90% of the, you know, three ring boards, so, we'll see,
616920	621180	I'll give it a shot, because hell, what can I do, break it more?
621180	628040	It's already broken, so, who cares, um, and then, I played a little bit of Final Fantasy
628040	633700	12 Revenant Wings, it's okay, I don't know, it's a little different, I guess it's the
633700	640920	combat system's kind of similar to Final Fantasy 12 a little bit, but, I guess because I didn't
640920	646320	play 12, the impact of these characters and when they're like, you know, oh, this person
646320	652480	came, it's like, okay, who are you, I don't know who you are, um, so it's okay for me,
652480	655760	but probably I should have played 12 before I played the DS game, but hey, that's their
655760	662280	damn fault for releasing one game on the DS and one on the PS2, um, let's see, what else
662280	668200	did I play, um, I actually played quite a bit of, um, No More Heroes, that game is fucking
668200	673840	awesome, it seriously is awesome, after reading a fact on Game Facts that was actually in
673840	678760	English, I kind of figured out how to actually play the game, pretty cool, I've finished
678760	682320	the first boss and you kind of have to run around and do different errands and stuff,
682320	687000	but um, pretty sweet game, definitely worth picking up when it comes out, and I think
687000	693160	it's only a few more weeks before it comes out, so, that'd be a cool one, um, and then,
693160	696880	other than that, just been playing around with my new PC, trying to get, well, Crysis
696880	701960	runs on it, I've just been trying to overclock it now, so, um, right now I've run into the
701960	706300	problem where I need a good program to read temperatures because every single program
706300	710200	they have reads it differently and I want to know which one's correct, so, you know,
710200	717720	I don't fry something, but, uh, my chips overclocked from 2.6 GHz to 3.3 right now, and then, um,
717720	725760	Crysis runs about 35, 40 frames per second, but I want it to run faster, and I'm also
725760	733520	getting another graphics card, because I replaced my old GTS, uh, or my 8800 GTS with the new
733520	742240	one that's, um, faster, the GTS 512, and then, um, getting a second one to SLI him, so, uh,
742240	747520	hopefully Crysis will run, um, shooting for 50 frames per second or 60, you know, I doubt
747520	749920	that's going to happen, but, smoother the better.
749920	755760	Alright, well, quite a lengthy gaming week, Loki, geez, I'm busy, uh, mine kind of pales
755760	760520	by comparison, you know, um, since the family of mine doesn't do a whole lot for the holidays,
760520	765560	uh, William and I decided to take a last minute getaway to Reno, and so, you know, Reno, not
765560	769160	to offend any of our listeners who might live in Reno, but it's kind of a poor man's Vegas,
769160	774360	you know, there's not a whole lot to do in Reno, except, you know, go to the big three
774360	778840	casinos, but we did go to one of the casinos there, uh, Harrah's, and just randomly we
778840	782360	found ourselves in the arcade, and I'll tell you what, the Harrah's arcade is actually
782360	785960	kind of cool, because there was a lot of classic shit in there that we got to kind of take
785960	791280	up, take some time to look at, including, um, uh, Mortal Kombat 4, they actually had
791280	794800	a Mortal Kombat 4 machine, which I haven't seen in a long time, and the Simpsons arcade
794800	798280	game, and William and I only played, like, one token on the Simpsons arcade game, but
798280	801000	it must have been set to easy or something, because we got quite a ways through the game,
801000	804880	uh, just on one token, which is pretty amazing, and here's the other cool thing they have
804880	811920	there, they have a DDR fourth mix solo machine, and I haven't seen one of those in years,
811920	815480	and of course, William's like, you gotta get up and dance, you gotta dance, like, I haven't
815480	820280	played DDR forever, Harrah's Tahoe, you said? No, that's Harrah's, uh, Reno, not Tahoe,
820280	825960	yeah. I played on that DDR fourth plus machine, yes, the solo one, I do remember that now,
825960	830680	but, um, yeah, that's funny. You know what's weird is that the casino's very odd, because
830680	835120	the arcade is, like, way back there, like, it's not like Circus Circus, which has all
835120	838880	those, which has, like, a new Pump It Up machine right in the middle of everything, but, like,
838880	842640	you know, at, um, Harrah's, you have to kind of go all the way back, and it's, like, back
842640	845600	in a dark corner, it's kind of sad. I'm guessing the Pump It Up machine's probably right in
845600	850520	the front of their arcade, where the third crane machine used to be for a while. And
850520	855200	now GS68 is telling me that at the El Dorado, they have the fourth plus solo machine, which
855200	858720	I completely miss somehow, but that's alright, you know what I was doing? I was gambling
858720	864880	and losing a lot of money. I won little jack, I won jackpots, I won a silver jackpot, except
864880	872520	it was on a penny machine, so I only won 35 bucks. That's cool. Solo sucks anyways. That's
872520	878640	a dated joke, wow. Oh my god, a DDR USA mix machine, yes. Oh, rad. That takes me back.
878640	883520	Oh, yeah, that takes me back. Good times. I love DDR USA. So, yeah, but here's the sad
883520	887320	thing, I had to play on trick. Like, remember when I used to be really good at DDR, and
887320	892880	you were good at DDR, and you were good at DDR? You used to play doubles, Jamie. I used
892880	899000	to play doubles on, like, five feet. I still play doubles, and hope that death comes to
899000	905400	me, but... Those were the days. And then, actually, it's funny, because some of my,
905400	909960	actually, those of you guys that know Xtopher, Xtopher's sister got married over the weekend,
909960	916040	and she married somebody who used to work at Konami's QA department with Shane, so I
916040	920600	saw a lot of people from my DDR days, because he obviously invited all his old co-workers.
920600	924160	I saw some people from the old DDR days, I hadn't seen him forever, so it was really
924160	930280	cool. Kind of a little bit of reunion. So it was nice. Anyhow, moving on, that has nothing
930280	933440	to do with Game of the Week, that's just tremendously. As far as other games, I played some World
933440	942400	of Warcraft, of course. I now have, like, I think three PVP purples, and some crafted
942400	947480	rare epic stuff, so I'm definitely starting to exhaust everything there is to do at level
947480	952000	70, but I still have lots of instances to run, and alts to level. And also, I'll tell
952000	957600	you what I've been playing. Santa brought me a copy of Super Mario Galaxy on the Wii,
957600	961840	which I'd played before on our preview show, but it was nice to have some more time to
961840	964980	play it without kind of that pressure of, you know, everything we're doing is being
964980	967960	broadcast on the internet, right? So I just kind of had time to take it slow, take it
967960	973920	easy. I fucking love it. You know what? And you know, I've said this on the show before,
973920	978600	folks have been listening for a while, I thought Mario 64 was a little bit overrated. I did
978600	983880	not think Mario 64 was the best Mario game of all time or any of that stuff. I just didn't
983880	987720	see it. I mean, it's a good game, yes. In fact, it's a great game, but it wasn't, like,
987720	992400	there was something about it I didn't quite like as much. But Mario Galaxy, it really
992400	997040	is all that. I mean, I love some of the puzzles in it, like that gravity puzzle where you're
997040	1002200	inside the tube and the gravities change in a different way. I just, it's cool. I love
1002200	1007480	it. So I definitely recommend, if you're a Wii owner, you have to get Galaxy, because
1007480	1011600	this is the type of game that the Wii was really made for. So I've definitely been spending
1011600	1015640	a lot of time on that. And thank you, Santa, for bringing me that. So that's pretty much
1015640	1019800	going to do it for my gaming week. How about you guys on the chat room, how was your guys'
1019800	1027880	gaming week? I see a lot of people were naming BeatMania 2DX distorted, Rockband was played
1027880	1036040	by Color of Sakura, Legend of Zelda Phantom Hourglass, Xenae or Xene, X-E-N-E, was playing
1036040	1039240	Persona 3. That's one of those games that came out this year that I totally missed.
1039240	1043320	I finished the Phantom Hourglass finally. Oh, what'd you think? The ending. It's easy.
1043320	1050440	It's a fucking easy game. I mean, that was it. The last boss is kind of, I guess, a little
1050440	1055880	bit more difficult than the rest of them, but it was really easy. It's just, I'm not
1055880	1061000	that great at games, but come on. I mean, seriously, it wasn't a challenge at all.
1061000	1064920	Alright. Anyhow, let's get into some housekeeping, then we'll get into some of tonight's news
1064920	1067880	and I'll tell you how the rest of the show's going to work, too. Our show's going to be
1067880	1071760	a little bit different tonight, and we're going to actually open up the Skype line a
1071760	1075920	little early tonight. Of course, now that I'm noticing that a lot of our regulars aren't
1075920	1080440	here and, you know, I'm hoping that we're going to get some calls on Skype line because
1080440	1083600	we really want you guys to participate, but if you guys don't call, we'll figure something
1083600	1088200	else out. But basically what we're going to do, before tonight's show, we went through
1088200	1092280	every single show role that we've done in 2007 because we write down all the stories
1092280	1095880	we want to cover in tonight's show. And so we basically went to every single show role
1095880	1101120	in 2007 and picked one story that really stuck out from each show that we did in 2007. So
1101120	1104560	we're going to kind of go back and revisit some of the headlines from our various shows
1104560	1108840	in 2007 and then talk about, with you guys on the phone, kind of what really stuck out
1108840	1113000	in your mind from the various months and what do you think really impacted the gaming scene
1113000	1116720	and the gaming industry as a whole in 2007. And then, of course, we want to get your picks
1116720	1121840	for the best game of 2007 and the worst game of 2007. We're going to tally it up and get
1121840	1126120	the definitive Orange Lounge radio choices. And at the very end of the show, Dark Soccer,
1126120	1131960	Alokia, myself, we will be letting you know our worst games of the year and our top five
1131960	1136680	favorite games of the year, each of us. And it's always very interesting because usually
1136680	1141680	we don't agree with critics because they are our personal top five favorites of the year.
1141680	1146240	It doesn't necessarily mean the games we think that, you know, should be critically lauded
1146240	1150400	as the five best. No, they're the five games we enjoy the most and we think were the best
1150400	1154200	that we spent our money on. So we'll be talking about that towards the end of tonight's show.
1154200	1156880	But for now, we're going to do a quick news rundown because we weren't here last week
1156880	1160600	and, of course, there still is news going on in the gaming world, even this week. So
1160600	1164240	before we get into the year-end review, let's talk about this week. And Loki is going to
1164240	1167760	do the honors tonight of just running down the week's news. And I think actually Jamie
1167760	1169560	has one or two stories. We'll get to that at the end.
1169560	1174840	Yeah. Okay. Anyways, this week, some, you know, stuff that's probably like not a big
1174840	1180880	surprise happened, including Sony of America Trademark Resistance 2. Oh my God, really?
1180880	1185320	They're going to make a sequel to a game that sold a lot for them. Oh my God, that is such
1185320	1186320	a shocker.
1186320	1187400	I'm so surprised.
1187400	1198120	So surprised. Anyways, Kiriyamaoka, one of our favorite music producers and also creator
1198120	1199800	of some recent Sun Hill games.
1199800	1202680	Gaming stud in general, wouldn't you agree, DarkSakura?
1202680	1203680	He's cute.
1203680	1208400	Gaming, he is pretty cute. We met him in person at E3 a few years ago. Gaming stud in general,
1208400	1213080	Kiriyamaoka. I don't just mean in the physical sense. I mean, he's just, he makes Silent
1213080	1216000	Hill for God's sake. He's amazing.
1216000	1217640	So we listen to what this man has to say.
1217640	1226480	Anyways, he was quoted actually saying that the U.S. team's graphical and technical ability
1226480	1233320	is amazing. There's a huge gap, actually, and he's talking about between the U.S. teams
1233320	1239760	and Japanese development houses with the way games are going right now. I don't know. I
1239760	1246040	guess that makes kind of sense, especially with a lot of the companies being in the U.S.,
1246040	1250040	Nintendo, I mean, they're both in Japan, the U.S. and stuff, but I don't know. A lot of
1250040	1253880	the third party companies are in the U.S., so I guess that makes sense. Not to say the
1253880	1255920	Japanese can't program good games.
1255920	1259720	I want to go off on a tangent real fast, because this discussion was actually, I was talking
1259720	1262720	to one of my friends in the car. We were up very late last night because we drove to Rocky
1262720	1267280	Horror in San Francisco, and it was William, myself, and our mutual friend, Jake, and Jake's
1267280	1271280	a big gaming nerd like us, and we were talking about kind of Japanese versus America, and
1271280	1274360	I think actually I was talking about this very thing right here, because somehow we
1274360	1276760	were talking about Silent Hill.
1276760	1280640	It kind of occurred to me, Nintendo's a very Japanese company, whereas Microsoft's a very
1280640	1286640	American company, and Microsoft seems to be kind of winning this. Well, I mean, I guess
1286640	1290360	I shouldn't say that, because the Wii is obviously dominating, but the Xbox is kind of dominating
1290360	1294440	in their own way, and it's kind of like, you know, the Xbox kind of caters to what's really
1294440	1298600	big in the American market right now, and that's internet gaming, and that's something
1298600	1302960	that, for whatever reason, Nintendo has never seen to capture.
1302960	1307300	Like, you know, Nintendo is not getting on board with internet gaming. They did one game
1307300	1310360	on the GameCube that was a third party game to begin with, right, and they really haven't
1310360	1313920	done much on the Wii yet. I mean, granted, we have Mario Kart, but we've all seen the
1313920	1320440	friend codes thing sucks and all that, and we were kind of wondering, like, why is it
1320440	1324360	that Nintendo does not get online gaming? And it kind of struck me, it's probably a
1324360	1330360	cultural difference, and what it probably is, is that arcades are dead here in America,
1330360	1334800	and that's why we're so big on internet gaming, whereas in Japan, it seems like arcades are
1334800	1339320	still, I mean, maybe not what they once were, but they're still very prevalent, and people
1339320	1341020	still meet up to do the gaming.
1341020	1344960	So what? I don't understand, though, because they recognize, though, that the US and, like,
1344960	1351080	Europe and stuff are big gaming markets and maybe even bigger than Japan, and, you know,
1351080	1354720	they recognize it. That's why we're getting so many Wiis here in the US. So it's not like
1354720	1357480	they don't understand that. It's just, they're just not doing it.
1357480	1361920	But, kind of like why I'm relating it to this story is that, you know, when that's their
1361920	1366320	culture, that's their perspective on things, and so maybe, I think, part of the reason
1366320	1370720	why, like, Akira Yomoka might be kind of, you know, really liking what the Americans
1370720	1375240	are doing now is that because it's a different approach based on the way things work here.
1375240	1381060	I'll tell you what it is, and this is pretty much, I mean, when they were planning out
1381060	1387200	these consoles, when the 360, PlayStation 3, and the, you know, we were all in development
1387200	1391320	and stuff, and they figured out what they wanted to do, Microsoft already had some success
1391320	1396080	with the Xbox Live service, so of course they wanted to bring that over, and they had done
1396080	1403080	a little bit with the Xbox Live Arcade service on the Xbox, very little, and then, you know,
1403840	1408900	of course it took off here. Problem is, though, Nintendo didn't plan for any sort of online
1408900	1412680	infrastructure. They didn't think it was a big deal. They said, oh, whatever, you know,
1412680	1416160	our systems sell very well by themselves. We have the portable systems, you know, maybe
1416160	1419600	we'll link it up with the DS and that kind of stuff, and they didn't really do anything
1419600	1424760	with it. Well, you know, come to find out, guess what? Online gaming is really popular,
1424760	1428680	and now they're like, crap, what do we do now? We don't have any sort of infrastructure
1428680	1433080	built for this stuff, and so now they're way behind with all that. Same with the PlayStation
1433080	1436200	Network, I mean, they didn't really have a unified online service or anything like that.
1436200	1441160	I think Sony's issue is that they are stretching themselves thin, because you notice when games
1441160	1445480	keep getting delayed, like, you know, LittleBigPlanet Home keeps getting delayed, I think that to
1445480	1449840	me says that Sony, their thing is that they've been trying to do both. They've been trying
1449840	1454520	to, to Sony's credit, I think everything they've been doing, they've been trying to
1454520	1457780	appeal, they are the ones that have truly been trying to appeal to a worldwide audience
1457780	1461320	the whole time, but they're stretching themselves too thin, they can't do it, they don't have
1461320	1466880	the resources to do it. Whereas Nintendo has focused their efforts on this, and Xbox for
1466880	1470080	the most part has focused their efforts on this, and both have excelled very well, while
1470080	1473600	Sony has spread themselves too thin. Well, and the other thing too, Microsoft now is
1473600	1477240	starting to figure out, hey, guess what, we've got to, you know, think about our Japanese
1477240	1481040	market as well, and that's why they're publishing games, you know, like, Lost Odyssey, Blue
1481040	1487920	Dragon, you know, stuff like that, to appeal to a more variety of, you know, consumer.
1487920	1491080	Because, you know, not everyone's going to love Halo, or love that kind of stuff, and
1491080	1496040	they're trying to also do, like, some of the kids' games and stuff, you know, Pinata, kind
1496040	1498920	of sucked, but, you know what, they don't have to really worry about that.
1498920	1500000	It was a good attempt.
1500000	1504280	It was an okay attempt, but they're, you know, third party, you know, publishers will take
1504280	1508920	care of that stuff, they don't have to really worry about it. Whereas Nintendo, they're
1508920	1513720	doing a lot of stuff that caters kind of towards the family, you know, the younger kids, you
1513720	1517280	know, even though they're trying to break out of that mold and stuff, unfortunately
1517280	1521920	a lot of the games that they're still releasing, even look at first party stuff, I mean, what,
1521920	1526320	you've got Metroid Prime 3, I guess that would be the only game, and maybe Excite Truck,
1526320	1530520	that's, you know, first party that would kind of appeal to, you know, more than just kids.
1530520	1535360	You know, some of these games like Disaster Day of Crisis, and, you know, Project Hammer,
1535360	1541060	which is cancelled, I mean, those games could have appealed to some older, you know, consumers,
1541060	1545400	but they didn't do it, so they kind of have to rely on third party companies to do that,
1545400	1549040	but unfortunately because there's not a lot of, you know, hey, look at this, you know,
1549040	1553160	it's a first party game, it was more of a mature title, it did really well, then a lot
1553160	1557480	of other companies will try to emulate that, but since no one's doing that, you know, look
1557480	1562880	at Manhunt 2, they attempted to be mature, and that kind of backfired on them, not because,
1562880	1566920	you know, it was mature, it was because it was a crappy game, but, you know, I think
1566920	1571340	like with games like No More Heroes coming out, I think that will do very well, I hope
1571340	1575280	it does very well, and because of that, a lot of people will say, hey, mature games
1575280	1578840	can be on this console, and so we'll put out more mature games.
1578840	1584000	Alright, well, I was going to turn to the chat room for some comments on this, some
1584000	1589840	polarizing statements made by us on Viva Pinata, Flaming Bozo says, Viva did not suck, and
1589840	1593720	Pooeater says, Viva did suck, so some polarizing opinions there.
1593720	1595920	Alright, what did they try to do with Viva Pinata?
1595920	1596920	I went from suck to blow.
1596920	1601120	Let me put it this way, what they, their expectations of Viva Pinata versus what actually happened
1601120	1603360	were a little different, they thought it was going to be the next Pokemon.
1603360	1608080	Yeah, I agree, they set their bar way too high on Viva Pinata, and I would not, I certainly
1608080	1612760	would never put Viva Pinata on a bad games of the year list, it just wasn't, it's not,
1612760	1613880	it wasn't Pokemon.
1613880	1617880	It's not a bad game, it's just a game I'm not going to play, I mean, there are kids,
1617880	1621760	I'm sure, that love the game, there are probably adults that love the game, it's just not for
1621760	1622760	me.
1622760	1625840	Viva Pinata Party Animals, that's crap.
1625840	1631560	I think even like, Major Nelson has said Viva Pinata Party Animals sucks, and that's pretty
1631560	1637360	bad when the people inside Microsoft don't like the game, I don't know that to be sure,
1637360	1638360	don't quote me on that.
1638360	1641640	They tried to look at what Pokemon has, and kind of emulate that, so they're like, okay,
1641640	1645760	it has a cartoon series, great, let's do a cartoon series, and it had a game, okay, let's
1645760	1646760	do this.
1646760	1649960	They put this out here, exactly like Pokemon, it's going to have the appeal of Pokemon.
1649960	1654480	No, it did not, in fact, I thought that adding the cartoon as well is kind of just shoving
1654480	1656360	it down our throats even more.
1656360	1660520	Just leave it as a game, if the game was popular enough to warrant a cartoon, great, do that.
1660520	1665900	I like Pooh Eater's idea, Viva Manhunt Pinata, there you go, I'm sorry, I did not mean to
1665900	1672360	derail the show with that little tangent, but when hasn't that happened before, sorry.
1672360	1677600	Next week, SNK will be producing yet another new game, oh wait, no, I'm sorry, they're
1677600	1683160	not, they're going to be putting out Metal Slug 3 on Xbox Live Arcade.
1683160	1687160	And the sound of Jamie cheering, by the way, is the only person you'll hear cheering about,
1687160	1688160	no, I'm just kidding.
1688160	1689160	You know what, it looks cool.
1689160	1690160	Metal Slug has a cult fanbase.
1690160	1691920	It's supposed to have updated HD visuals.
1691920	1692920	That's cool.
1692920	1695400	Whatever that's supposed to mean, because all the screenshots don't look updated to
1695400	1699000	me, but okay, I'll take the word for it.
1699000	1703600	Does HD visuals mean that they've added bars on the side that are prez?
1703600	1708760	They're going to do like they did with Double Dragon, not Double Dragon, yeah, Double Dragon.
1708760	1709760	That's okay, I guess.
1709760	1713240	It looks okay, I think, hey, you know what, if SNK's listening, if you want to remake
1713240	1718480	the game, great, or like reissue it, but like, redo all the visuals kind of like, I don't
1718480	1724760	know, Super Street Fighter 2, HD, whatever, you know, that's going to be coming out, redo
1724760	1726320	all the graphics, that'd be awesome.
1726320	1729440	Metal Slug might actually be a really fun live game.
1729440	1730440	It is.
1730440	1731440	Like, to play with people on live.
1731440	1736960	And it is going to have co-op over live, so that's kind of cool, and so yeah, it's 800
1736960	1740320	Microsoft points, should be out Wednesday, no word on if there's going to be another
1740320	1743520	game coming out as well, because it's only one game announced so far.
1743520	1746760	You know, and to Metal Slug's credit, although Loki and I give it a hard time on this show
1746760	1750840	for kind of being the same thing over and over, it really is a lot of fun, I think this
1750840	1751840	will be a good title.
1751840	1759800	I'd like to, you know, make fun of SNK because, you know, they're still making 16-bit games
1759800	1760800	all these years later.
1760800	1765040	The last four games that have come out from them have been, like, anthologies, okay, so,
1765040	1768860	no offense, I mean, hey, you know what, you're not the only company that does that, Capcom
1768860	1771840	and Activision, or Midway, I mean, everybody's...
1771840	1776680	But some of the anthologies, like the Mega Man anthology kicks ass, like, I don't know.
1776680	1777680	I don't know.
1777680	1783560	I just, you know, seriously, Metal Slug 3, Metal Slug 1, they've been re-released so
1783560	1788520	many times, it's like, okay, great, we love these games, but let's make something new,
1788520	1789520	okay?
1789520	1795560	Anyways, so, there's of course a new Street Fighter movie coming out, and not sure whether
1795560	1800520	you're going to be happy about that or not, but apparently one of the stars that they
1800520	1808480	have casted so far is in the role of Chun-Li, and it's Smallville's Kristin Kriek, and,
1808480	1812760	I don't know, she doesn't look Asian to me, but hey, she looks hot, so that's...
1812760	1815080	Is that the one that plays Lana?
1815080	1816080	I believe so.
1816080	1817080	Yeah, I believe so.
1817080	1818080	She's Asian.
1818080	1821240	She doesn't look Asian.
1821240	1827560	I'm sorry, that's not, I don't know, whatever, it'll work, I think, but hey.
1827560	1828560	Is she hot?
1828560	1831680	I mean, that's what most of the boys want to know, is she hot?
1831680	1832680	And some of the girls.
1832680	1836160	You know, that's the most important thing, isn't it?
1836160	1838600	I mean, ethnicity be damned.
1838600	1843480	Anyways, so, I don't know if you, really to be honest, the last Street Fighter movie didn't
1843480	1847680	set the bar too high, so, I mean, you don't have to try that hard to make a good movie
1847680	1848680	here.
1848680	1849680	But it had Kylie.
1849680	1853240	Yes, Kylie Minogue was awesome as Kami.
1853240	1854240	And who was Chun-Li?
1854240	1855320	Ming-Na was Chun-Li.
1855320	1856320	She's on ER now.
1856320	1857320	She wasn't bad.
1857320	1858320	She wasn't bad.
1858320	1864320	Apparently, anyways, I've actually watched this little video here.
1864320	1870000	There is a conference that went on, a hacking conference called 24C3.
1870000	1875440	And it's, I guess, an annual four-day conference organized by a hacking group called Chaos
1875440	1881840	Computer Club, where, of course, thousands of hackers and scientists, artists, et cetera,
1881840	1882840	gather.
1882840	1889840	So, one of the things that they showed off was that they have completely hacked the Wii.
1889840	1891480	This is an unmodded Wii.
1891480	1895280	They are managed, well, I shouldn't say it's unmodded, but there's no mod ship running
1895280	1896280	in it.
1896280	1901320	And they've, using a specially made disk and a kind of a serial port thing, they called
1901320	1909120	it a tweezer attack, they were able to run homebrew software in Wii mode.
1909120	1915360	Usually before that, they've only been able to do it through the GameCube operating system
1915360	1916920	or whatever on there.
1916920	1922000	It's all been limited to GameCube kind of homebrew stuff, but now they have access to
1922000	1927440	the full Wii stuff and within a matter of time, we're going to see a lot more Wii homebrew
1927440	1928440	out there.
1928440	1930000	So, I guess that's a good thing.
1930000	1935040	If you're interested, though, there is a YouTube video out there that shows kind of the whole
1935040	1936040	demonstration.
1936040	1941800	It's pretty much, they have like, I guess, a modded Lego Star Wars complete saga disk
1941800	1946560	and they used, they ran some program that showed like, you know, kind of the coordinates
1946560	1951720	of your Wii pointer and you could start and stop the drives and stuff like that.
1951720	1954040	That reminds me of something that I saw on YouTube.
1954040	1955760	I have a feeling we're thinking of the same thing.
1955760	1956760	Go ahead.
1956760	1959120	The guy did the target placing.
1959120	1960800	That is the same thing I'm thinking of.
1960800	1961800	Wasn't that shit amazing?
1961800	1962800	That was pretty cool.
1962800	1964300	Did you see that YouTube?
1964300	1968480	The guy, and I can't remember his name, I'm sorry, maybe somebody in chat remembers, but
1968480	1973840	he was a student at some school and he put together this thing where he swapped the Wiimote
1973840	1981240	and the sensor bar to create this, you know, the television instead of looking like, you
1981240	1983880	know, a normal Wii game, it looked like a portal into another world.
1983880	1987840	He didn't use the sensor bar itself, he actually used two infrareds attached to goggles.
1987840	1988840	Okay, sorry, same concept.
1988840	1990840	Because the sensor bar itself has an infrared reflect.
1990840	1992640	Right, and he put them in the glasses.
1992640	1995800	And it was basically, this YouTube is amazing, it's had over a million views, I'm sure most
1995800	2000600	of you have seen it, but it was basically, he kind of called out a lot of the game developers
2000600	2004640	in it and said, hey, if you want to do something this cool, you know, give me a call or you
2004640	2005640	should do it.
2005640	2007320	You know, I just told you how to do it.
2007320	2012680	So it looked amazing, just even in the little YouTube, the way, oh wow.
2012680	2016200	It was, yeah, it was like a head tracking, a VR head tracking is what it is, they have
2016200	2023320	that right now for like flight sims, like they're showing flight sim 10 or whatever,
2023320	2028280	you can do that and you can actually do it where it will, I don't know.
2028280	2030000	That was not a hacking thing this guy did.
2030000	2035280	Well, he made his own custom program, but you know, still, the hardware he used was
2035280	2038240	all pretty much, you know, stuff that could easily be done.
2038240	2039240	It just looked amazing.
2039240	2044200	Well, you can, how was it, adjust, I guess scale it so you don't have to look completely
2044200	2048920	behind you to look behind you and stuff like that, but yeah, it's pretty cool.
2048920	2054040	And he had some other things too, like on how to make like a VR, like whiteboard type
2054040	2056080	thing and some other stuff.
2056080	2057080	Wow.
2057080	2067840	So, anyways, other things to note here, some that may not be too happy unfortunately and
2067840	2072800	I hate to be the one to mention this, but I'm just gonna say it, this hasn't really
2072800	2080320	been out there that much, or actually it hasn't been out there yet, this news, but, let me
2080320	2086200	just say it I guess, it is a very likely situation that Smash Brothers may have been delayed
2086200	2089320	another month.
2089320	2091840	And where is this coming from?
2091840	2098720	I just happened to see a date change in our system for March now for Smash Brothers.
2098720	2100300	So it could just be an anomaly?
2100300	2102680	It could be an anomaly, it could be one of those things.
2102680	2107760	Now here's why I think it might be true though, because they're running into, I guess, there
2107760	2114460	are so many places that they can manufacture Wii Dis, and right now they're at full production
2114460	2118620	and because of that, a lot of games are getting delayed because they can't manufacture this
2118620	2121200	in time.
2121200	2126960	And they've said a few months ago that all Wii games and some DS games will be affected
2126960	2135260	by this, and so being that the case, one of two things could be happening here, one, distribution
2135260	2139880	may not be getting their copies, but retail will be, if there's going to be a shortage
2139880	2143160	like that, if they're anticipating that there's going to be a shortage, they're going to delay
2143160	2147480	it for everybody else for a month, or it really is delayed a month.
2147480	2153960	So right now, just don't be surprised if you see that news come out, but I wouldn't confirm
2153960	2155960	it 100% yet.
2155960	2156960	Interesting.
2156960	2158960	I don't know.
2158960	2163160	Now as some folks are hoping, could it be that they've delayed it to add Mega Man?
2163160	2165880	I doubt that.
2165880	2169560	Didn't the guy who made Mega Man come out this week and say Mega Man is not in Smash
2169560	2170560	Bros?
2170560	2171560	I don't remember.
2171560	2172560	I'm almost positive I read a story about that.
2172560	2175640	Everyone thought that the 20th anniversary of Mega Man they were in announced that Mega
2175640	2176640	Man was going to be in there.
2176640	2179680	I would like Mega Man in there, I think that'd be pretty awesome, but I don't think that's
2179680	2180680	going to happen.
2180680	2185080	And Color of Sakura also points out in their chatroom that Brawl already went gold in Japan.
2185080	2186080	Yeah.
2186080	2187080	So that's good.
2187080	2190560	Well, it's rumored that it went gold in Japan.
2190560	2195800	It's not official yet, because that was some website that is in production or whatever.
2195800	2199440	But it's not official yet, by any means.
2199440	2204620	Brack2000 speculates if they are going to come out and announce this delay, again, many
2204620	2208220	of the things Loki said is true, it could be an anomaly, it could be the distribution
2208220	2210680	only is getting delayed or what have you.
2210680	2212800	Brack2000 has an interesting thought here.
2212800	2217360	I wonder if they'll announce this delay with a huge announcement like last time with Sonic.
2217360	2219840	Like good news to soften the blow?
2219840	2225000	Here's the thing though, and this is the only reason why I think it might be true, any time
2225000	2228420	that we've been delayed product or whatever, like say, oh we're not going to ship you this
2228420	2232880	much or whatever, they didn't change the street date, they just, here's the date for this,
2232880	2237480	oh by the way, you're not getting any until this time.
2237480	2242720	I doubt they would change the date, but I'm just saying, it's about a month, I think March
2242720	2243720	9th is what we showed.
2243720	2244720	Keep us posted.
2244720	2245720	We'll see, I'll keep you posted.
2245720	2247720	You heard it here first.
2247720	2249840	But guess, I was going to mention one other thing.
2249840	2257960	There's two other games actually that, it's funny because some games might not be only
2257960	2262920	on Xbox 360, one we'll probably be talking about a little bit later of course, or we're
2262920	2270200	talking about quite a while ago, our wonderful game that involves rolling certain things
2270200	2271440	around.
2271440	2277380	It's still showing in our system, and it's actually moved dates the other week, sometime
2277380	2284360	around say, April-ish, so it's still very possible that that's actually coming out.
2284360	2285360	Interesting.
2285360	2286360	Yeah.
2286360	2289640	Could you, I could totally picture a gold edition with all the downloadable content
2289640	2293520	included in the game, just like Marvel Ultimate Alliance or something like that.
2293520	2294520	That'd be interesting.
2294520	2295520	Totally see that coming.
2295520	2300720	And then let's see here, I was going to mention one other thing real quick, Silent Hill Origins,
2300720	2305600	that was coming out on PlayStation 2 in Japan, it is coming out over here too.
2305600	2308280	Actually sooner than later, March.
2308280	2309280	Nice!
2309280	2312920	Very excited about that, you know, because I didn't play too much of the PSP version,
2312920	2315560	but PlayStation 2, that might be pretty cool.
2315560	2319800	Even though I guess I could plug in my PSP to my TV and do the same thing.
2319800	2323680	Finally, let's see here, what else we've got.
2323680	2332200	Oh, the DS, it's actually sold quite a bit of units in Japan, so much so that it's actually
2332200	2336720	outsold the PlayStation 2 over the course of its lifetime.
2336720	2341720	So that's pretty cool, hasn't done it in the U.S. though yet.
2341720	2349000	And then finally, the original Nights game on Nights Into Dreams will be coming to Game
2349000	2350840	Tap in 2008.
2350840	2354680	I've been playing that already.
2354680	2356800	You do Christmas nights this time of year, right?
2356800	2357800	I do Christmas nights.
2357800	2358800	Good times?
2358800	2359800	Very hard to watch on my TV.
2359800	2363640	Jamie, you've got a story for us real quick, and then we're going to open up the Skype
2363640	2364640	line.
2364640	2370280	So 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, call in and talk to us
2370280	2372680	about the year 2007.
2372680	2378560	This is more of a humor thing, because I think it's pretty damn funny, is that Nokia's N-Gage
2378560	2385120	first access platform has been delayed, and it's not going to be out in time for the holidays.
2385120	2391040	It was going to work on the Nokia N81 and N81A gigabyte phone for games and other types
2391040	2397040	of fun stuff, and they said that they ran into a little glitch while running it through
2397040	2398040	global testing.
2398040	2401400	So it's not there, like anyone cares.
2401400	2408880	I know what I was going to say, I'm sure all of America and the rest of the world, frankly,
2408880	2409880	is disappointed.
2409880	2410880	Phantom?
2410880	2411880	Yeah, by this news.
2411880	2413160	What ever happened to the fucking Phantom?
2413160	2415240	The lap board came out.
2415240	2416240	Really?
2416240	2417240	Yeah.
2417240	2418800	So it went from being console to lap board?
2418800	2419800	Yeah.
2419800	2420800	Interesting.
2420800	2422720	I didn't think the console was going to work when they were showing it off.
2422720	2425800	Oh my god, because it was just a PC, I'm like, I don't get this.
2425800	2427800	Who would download PC games?
2427800	2433680	Apparently Steam worked, so I was wrong there, but still, I mean, I don't know.
2433680	2439400	If they had a console that was just Steam, that might be pretty cool, maybe.
2439400	2443560	Well our Skype line is open, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
2443560	2445640	Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
2445640	2451480	Please remember though, if you're going to call us on Skype, give our test call a call
2451480	2452480	first.
2452480	2456400	That's ECHO123 on Skype, and that way you don't sound like shit when you get through
2456400	2457400	on the Skype line.
2457400	2460520	And what we're going to do is we're going to recap some of the stories that we went
2460520	2466840	over this year in the various months of the year, and I'll explain how that works as soon
2466840	2467840	as we take our first call.
2467840	2468840	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.
2468840	2470000	Who's this?
2470000	2471000	This is Ravenstaufen.
2471000	2472000	Can you hear me?
2472000	2473000	I can hear you, sir.
2473000	2474320	How are you?
2474320	2475320	I am fine.
2475320	2479020	Well god damn if it wouldn't be a year in review show if we didn't have you here, Ravenstaufen,
2479020	2480160	so I appreciate you calling in.
2480160	2481640	How are you doing?
2481640	2482640	I'm doing fine.
2482640	2484980	I'm playing Mario Galaxy just like you are.
2484980	2486640	Isn't it fucking great?
2486640	2488440	I do think it's fucking great.
2488440	2489440	I really do.
2489440	2490440	Excellent.
2490440	2492640	Well, go ahead.
2492640	2496200	The thing about Mario Galaxy that impresses me is the graphics.
2496200	2498600	I know the Wii is a piece of shit.
2498600	2502200	That's what some people say, but I really think that the Wii can pull off some really
2502200	2503200	good graphics.
2503200	2507800	You know, and we've said it before on this show, Nintendo loves to have aces in their
2507800	2513740	sleeves, and their systems always have these little hidden features and are probably capable
2513740	2516600	of much more than people usually give them credit for originally.
2516600	2518480	That's how they extend the life of their systems.
2518480	2521640	So I'm sure you have not seen the best looking Wii game yet.
2521640	2524160	Yeah, but this one is pretty good.
2524160	2529680	I really like what they did with the little effects, the little twinkles, and the little
2529680	2533760	things you go in the air, you see little things here and there.
2533760	2534760	The water shines.
2534760	2540440	Well, something to keep in mind too, Ravenstaufen, is that Mario Galaxy was not a ported GameCube
2540440	2541440	game, either.
2541440	2542440	You know what I mean?
2542440	2547640	It's truly an original game, and I think that's part of what made it stand out.
2547640	2550040	But it is colorful, so that's what I'm going to say.
2550040	2554760	Well, Raven, we're going to ask you to help us kind of recap the year here a little bit.
2554760	2556040	We're going to kind of go month by month.
2556040	2559440	I'm going to tell you about some of the top stories we went over, and I'd like to hear
2559440	2563840	your thoughts on what you thought was really the standout story from that month.
2563840	2564840	Sound good?
2564840	2566480	Oh, I was waiting for this, yeah.
2566480	2569000	All right, then we'll get your best and worst game of the year at the end.
2569000	2573680	So let's take a trip all the way back to January, and January started off with Orange
2573680	2574680	Honors Radio episode 215.
2574680	2581160	In episode 215, one of the headlines we talked about was that E3's replacement was announced,
2581160	2586960	and E3 was going to be replaced with E for All Expo, and of course we say replaced with,
2586960	2587960	we mean the...
2587960	2588960	Loosely.
2588960	2592520	Yeah, kind of loosely, because obviously we had many E3 happen a little later in the year,
2592520	2597560	but in the very first week of 2007, we learned about the E for All Expo was kind of first
2597560	2598560	announced.
2598560	2603720	In episode number 216, the top story from that week was a woman right here in the city
2603720	2608960	that we broadcast from in Rancho Cordova, California.
2608960	2615880	The woman died in our local radio station, 107.9's Hold Your Wee for a Wee contest, and
2615880	2620800	I see Jamie rolled her eyes and sighed when she heard about that.
2620800	2627760	Why are they rolling me the eyes and sighing, if I wasn't already sick, I'd be sick?
2627760	2631560	It is a very tragic thing, and I remember that you didn't do a show that week when that
2631560	2632560	story broke.
2632560	2633560	That's right.
2633560	2634560	We only did three shows in January.
2634560	2636800	I don't remember what happened, but we were off for a week in January.
2636800	2637800	I was at Disneyland.
2637800	2638800	You were at Disney...
2638800	2639800	Oh, we both were at Disneyland.
2639800	2640800	I was at Disneyland.
2640800	2641800	That's what it was.
2641800	2643840	That was my first trip to Disneyland a long time, so we were off, I think it was Martin
2643840	2646960	Luther King weekend, and that's the weekend it all went down.
2646960	2650760	You're right, we weren't on that week, and we came back and we were just like, you know,
2650760	2654920	if you think it's bad on the internet, try living here, where it's all going down.
2654920	2658960	Sorry, you were doing your little guys on the show, and you recapped it there.
2658960	2666960	I think that I was just whole surprised that no one had ever heard of drinking too much
2666960	2667960	water.
2667960	2673720	It was so funny, because I remember especially in Sacramento, the area where we live, there's
2673720	2675520	only been so many...
2675520	2676520	There has not been...
2676520	2678040	I don't have a number.
2678040	2682560	There have not been that many water deaths in this country, but there have been multiple
2682560	2686320	ones in the Sacramento region in the past couple of years, because there was the frat
2686320	2689080	kid at Chico State, which is where I went to school.
2689080	2690400	That's only like 90 minutes north of here.
2690400	2693800	There was that frat kid who, as part of the initiation, had to drink all that water, and
2693800	2701160	he died of water intoxication, which is what caught the DJs in a lot of fire in the whole
2701160	2705820	station, which, by the way, unlike I predicted earlier in the year, I believe when the story
2705820	2709040	first launched, 107.9 is still the end.
2709040	2711140	It's still owned by the same people.
2711140	2713080	They have a new morning program in place now.
2713080	2717360	I don't remember what they're called, but they have other wacky morning DJs on there
2717360	2721960	doing their thing, and same old stick, but with different people.
2721960	2726880	Well, I think it was good that the ones that were in charge of that got fired, because
2726880	2733480	honestly, I guess the majority of people in the world just don't know better.
2733480	2739880	I'm not going to go into my whole stupid people, including the gene pool thing, but still Darwin's
2739880	2742680	theory had some merit.
2742680	2746640	Episode number 217 in January, we only did three shows in January.
2746640	2750440	Episode 215, one of the top headlines that week was the news channel launched on the
2750440	2752280	Nintendo Wii.
2752280	2757440	You might remember when the Nintendo Wii first came out last year, we had the weather channel
2757440	2758920	was forthcoming in the news channel.
2758920	2763020	The news channel finally launched in January, and the reason why it's kind of noteworthy
2763020	2769040	is because it was a game console doing something pretty major other than games.
2769040	2770720	And it was the news channel.
2770720	2775760	I have not watched the news channel ever, ever, ever.
2775760	2777720	Does anybody actually use the news channel?
2777720	2778720	How about chat?
2778720	2781520	Does anybody in chat use the news channel?
2781520	2782520	Complete waste of time.
2782520	2784200	We should be able to remove that crap.
2784200	2785960	Raven, do you use the news channel?
2785960	2789360	I used it when it first came out, and do you remember what the first headline when you
2789360	2791520	went to technology was?
2791520	2796200	Was that, wasn't it the woman dying from the Wii, or what?
2796200	2799280	No, it was the PlayStation 3 launching in Japan, in Europe.
2799280	2800920	I remember that, that's right.
2800920	2802920	Wow, you got a good memory, that's right.
2802920	2807800	I remember I was amused because the first story I brought up in the technology was a
2807800	2809640	story about the PlayStation 3 launching.
2809640	2814200	I'm like, I'm reading about the PlayStation 3 on my Wii, this is weird.
2814200	2816280	Feels like an oxymoron, doesn't it?
2816280	2819720	Act Def says my brother does use it daily.
2819720	2821900	Color of Sakura says I have used the channel.
2821900	2825760	Mac Man says I use the new channel to wipe my ass.
2825760	2828040	I don't use the channel at all.
2828040	2831840	I think I looked at it once, and I went like, ah, don't eat it.
2831840	2838960	I use it once in a while just kind of to spin the globe, and check out, because like sometimes
2838960	2842840	you really want to know what's going on, and like, you know.
2842840	2846240	I just want to spin the globe and make everyone dizzy, yay!
2846240	2847240	Exactly.
2847240	2849920	Well, Raven, out of those stories, what do you think was probably the most impactful
2849920	2852480	in the game industry in January, and why?
2852480	2857160	The one about the Wii water one, when you cold your Wii for a Wii, because that didn't
2857160	2859960	go away quite fast.
2859960	2863280	It kept on going, lawsuits, people aren't suing Nintendo, all of that.
2863280	2866340	Yeah, but everyone forgot about it, like long after.
2866340	2868080	It lingered like a bad snow.
2868080	2869080	Seriously.
2869080	2870080	Just like some other ones.
2870080	2873280	I don't know, because it seemed like that story came up a couple of times, because then
2873280	2875480	like, you know, the family was going to sue Nintendo.
2875480	2877000	I remember that was a big follow-up story.
2877000	2878000	Yeah, because they're stupid.
2878000	2880740	And that's ridiculous, because Nintendo didn't have anything to do with it other than making
2880740	2881740	the product.
2881740	2885200	Oh, God, stupid people irritate the shit out of me.
2885200	2888600	Because they made the product, they engineered the desire for the product.
2888600	2891480	To be fair, they didn't actually sue Nintendo.
2891480	2896360	It was an exploratory thing, they were thinking of doing it, and they decided not to, so intelligence
2896360	2897360	did prevail.
2897360	2898360	Even considering it is stupid.
2898360	2899360	All right.
2899360	2901960	Because they know they'll get anywhere, nowhere with Nintendo.
2901960	2902960	All right.
2902960	2905240	Well, Raven, let's go ahead and do another month.
2905240	2909440	We'll let everybody do two months, because we're kind of low on people tonight, so you
2909440	2912480	want to continue to adventure with us into February, Raven?
2912480	2913480	It's fine by me.
2913480	2914480	All right.
2914480	2916260	Episode 218 started off February.
2916260	2920400	A games as porn bill failed in the state of Utah.
2920400	2924400	Yeah, especially the games they're out now, I would not consider those porn.
2924400	2925400	Geez.
2925400	2926400	Yes, that's right.
2926400	2930640	Utah was going to, at one point, put some of the adult games, basically regulate it
2930640	2932680	the same way they did porn.
2932680	2933960	But that bill failed in early January.
2933960	2936360	That makes absolutely no sense to this day.
2936360	2939560	I still think to myself, okay, Mario has porn.
2939560	2941920	That's a great idea, Utah.
2941920	2944600	Now Manhunt 2, though, is Manhunt 2 porn?
2944600	2945600	Nope.
2945600	2946680	To them, it is.
2946680	2948880	In a way, though, it may not be porn.
2948880	2952920	But of course, I've said this before, anything you could say about Manhunt 2 and how bad
2952920	2956680	it is for society, I go, Saw 4.
2956680	2958280	I'll say this about Manhunt 2.
2958280	2959280	What?
2959280	2962520	When I first heard Manhunt 2 was going to release, and when I looked at it, say Nintendo
2962520	2963880	Wii, I had to do a double shot.
2963880	2967800	I'm like, it's coming out for the PlayStation 2, PSP, and Nintendo Wii, I'm like, Nintendo
2967800	2968800	Wii?
2968800	2969800	All right.
2969800	2974760	Well, moving on through the month, Episode 219, one of the stick-out stories from that
2974760	2982240	episode, Codemasters had to replace faulty Bubble Bobble DS cartridges when the boss
2982240	2986400	in Level 30 didn't fucking show up.
2986400	2988240	You gotta love it.
2988240	2993680	And endless jokes for years and years here on this program when that happened.
2993680	3000160	Episode number 220, an insider in the gaming industry went on to PartnerNet, which is Xbox
3000160	3005800	Live's kind of staging area for Xbox Live, and spilled the beans on some of the upcoming
3005800	3008520	releases including Jetpack and Tetris Online.
3008520	3012600	But what should also be noted is that this news came all the way back from February,
3012600	3017760	and there were some other game titles that we never saw, like Juiced 2007 and Ob's Pinball.
3017760	3023160	Of course, a game like Ob's Pinball could have become the Pinball FX game that we did
3023160	3024160	yet.
3024160	3027240	Juice 2007 is just Juice 2 Hot Import Nights.
3027240	3034560	Oh, and it wasn't an actual arcade game or what have you, it was download content for
3034560	3035560	an existing game.
3035560	3039640	But nevertheless, this story was important because it was kind of a sign of people on
3039640	3046480	the inside, you know, kind of spilling the beans and getting all the secrets out there.
3046480	3049420	Those people suck.
3049420	3054520	Episode number 221, the last show we did in February, was the week that Warhawk was announced
3054520	3058080	that it was only going to be a downloadable title on the PlayStation 3.
3058080	3059080	Well, it was ruined.
3059080	3060080	Was it ruined?
3060080	3065760	No, it was confirmed for a while, and then they came back and said, but we're also going
3065760	3069200	to release it on Blu-Ray with the headset and all this stuff.
3069200	3072960	So that was the week, though, that Warhawk was originally announced as a download-only
3072960	3079280	title, which was big because, you know, obviously this was one of the games that Sony was pushing
3079280	3082080	and pushing when they first showed off the PlayStation 3.
3082080	3085480	And for this to kind of go back, you know, and say, well, we're just going to make it
3085480	3087080	a download-only game was kind of...
3087080	3089240	Six axis, all that stuff was going to be in it.
3089240	3094160	I'll never forget when they were showing off the six axis and he was trying to land the
3094160	3098760	jet on, like, the actual carrier thing, and it almost, like, tipped it off the edge of
3098760	3101160	the cliff because he didn't land it right.
3101160	3102160	That's hilarious.
3102160	3103920	That's what I'll remember, Warhawk.
3103920	3109800	All right, so Raven, we have Games as Porn in Utah, Bubble Bobble broken, PartnerNet
3109800	3113800	spills the beans, and Warhawk download-only on PlayStation 3.
3113800	3116920	What do you think had the most impact from February, the longest lasting impression on
3116920	3118880	2007 for gaming?
3118880	3121860	Of course, Bubble Bobble, how do you expect?
3121860	3126400	There's a game that the bosses show up, you're like, well, like, come on, boss, come out,
3126400	3128720	I need you, and you just never showed up.
3128720	3133080	Or how about the fact that, did anybody test this game?
3133080	3136120	There's no testers in Codemasters, that's hilarious.
3136120	3139600	Apparently not, and it's kind of sad because I have a lot of friends who have been game
3139600	3143240	testers that do very good jobs, you know, for various companies that they've worked
3143240	3147840	for, and it was just kind of sad when, you know, this kind of gave game testers everywhere
3147840	3150720	a bad name that something like this slipped through the cracks.
3150720	3155880	But obviously this was management cutting corners to meet some deadlines, and probably
3155880	3159600	the game did not go through the extensive testing it should have, right?
3159600	3165720	Yeah, but it just, to me, it just boggles the mind how the boss never showed up.
3165720	3168120	I mean, how do you miss that?
3168120	3169120	I don't know.
3169120	3170120	Good question.
3170120	3173680	Chat Room and Loki and Dark Soccer, do you guys agree with Raven's picks?
3173680	3177200	You think the Wii for a Wii and the Bubble Bobble were probably the biggest stories out
3177200	3178200	of those months?
3178200	3179200	Yeah.
3179200	3180200	Yeah, I guess.
3180200	3181200	Yeah.
3181200	3182200	All right.
3182200	3187600	Well, Raven, while we get the Chat Room's impressions of your picks there, why don't
3187600	3192080	you tell us what, in your opinion, and you can use any criteria you want, you don't have
3192080	3195280	to listen to what the critics say or what anybody else says but yourself, what, in your
3195280	3201520	opinion, was the worst game of 2007, the game that everybody should stay the hell away from?
3201520	3204000	Please stay the hell away of this one game.
3204000	3208200	I swear to you, it's free, but it's not even more free.
3208200	3210320	Yaris for the 360.
3210320	3211320	Just stay away.
3211320	3214760	Toyota Yaris on the 360, the worst game of 2007.
3214760	3218040	Free and the robotic claw didn't do anything for you?
3218040	3219040	Oh my God.
3219040	3220800	I want my time back.
3220800	3221800	I don't want my money.
3221800	3224480	I want my time back for that.
3224480	3227840	Best game of 2007, in your opinion, Raven?
3227840	3228960	Just one?
3228960	3229960	Just one.
3229960	3233100	You can tell us what some of your runner-ups would be, but we just want to know your number
3233100	3234100	one game.
3234100	3235100	That's the only one we're writing down.
3235100	3236100	Let's see.
3236100	3237100	I guess I'll go with Galaxy.
3237100	3240160	I really enjoy that.
3240160	3241160	I really enjoy it.
3241160	3246120	Even one of those games that just shows off the Wii and just puts everything in a nice
3246120	3250520	package going, Nintendo did something.
3250520	3251880	Anything kind of close for you?
3251880	3255600	Oh, there's a lot of things close, like Bioshock and Call of Duty 4.
3255600	3257320	You can't complain with those.
3257320	3259640	Overall, was it a good year for games, Ravenstaufen?
3259640	3262280	Overall, it's a great year for games.
3262280	3263760	I compare it to 2004.
3263760	3267400	What was so hot about 2004, remind us?
3267400	3269560	We had Grand Theft Auto, San Andreas.
3269560	3270760	We had Halo 2.
3270760	3273320	We had Half-Life 2.
3273320	3275280	We had God of War 1.
3275280	3276840	All those games came out in that year.
3276840	3277840	All right.
3277840	3280760	Well, Ravenstaufen, thanks so much for reflecting on the year with us.
3280760	3282560	We appreciate it, all right?
3282560	3283880	Thank you for having me on.
3283880	3284880	You are welcome, sir.
3284880	3285880	I appreciate it.
3285880	3286880	Best of luck in 2008.
3286880	3288440	We'll continue to hear from you in the year, right?
3288440	3289440	You bet.
3289440	3290440	All right.
3290440	3291440	Take care, buddy.
3291440	3292440	Bye.
3292440	3297160	If you want to give us a call and help us out in March and April, give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
3297160	3305280	Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, and I'm trying to look at some of the comments
3305280	3306280	in the chat room here.
3306280	3310960	DarkZombie says, I demand Yaris 2 for Xbox Live Arcade.
3310960	3313400	ShadowSlayer says, Bubble Bobble is the best game ever.
3313400	3317640	I'm assuming he means the original, not the newer one.
3317640	3320560	Let's go to the phones and see who's going to join us for the next part of the show.
3320560	3321560	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.
3321560	3322560	Who's this?
3322560	3325400	This is DJ Darknight in house.
3325400	3326840	Hey, DJ Darknight.
3326840	3327840	How are you doing, my friend?
3327840	3328840	I'm all right.
3328840	3330560	How about y'all guys tonight?
3330560	3331560	I am excellent.
3331560	3332560	Hi.
3332560	3336960	So, Darknight, are you ready to reflect on some of the previous months here in 2007?
3336960	3340840	Yeah, I wanted to kind of follow up on that bubble ball thing, but it might be a little
3340840	3341840	bit later on.
3341840	3342840	Go ahead.
3342840	3343840	Go ahead, sir.
3343840	3350280	There was another DS game that had that same problem, and it was SNK versus Capcom Car
3350280	3351280	Fighter.
3351280	3354480	Yeah, the one card that wouldn't... Yeah, I remember that.
3354480	3357240	And get past the thing because the game would lock up or something.
3357240	3360280	Like a card didn't... Yeah, a card froze the game or something.
3360280	3361280	That's right.
3361280	3365680	So, it was interesting that that bubble ball thing kind of started to trend, sadly.
3365680	3366680	Yeah.
3366680	3367680	All right.
3367680	3370520	That one really hurt everybody for a while.
3370520	3375080	Hopefully lessons learned by all gaming companies in regards to testing your games for 2008.
3375080	3377880	Well, let's talk about March and April.
3377880	3384120	Starting off in March, episode number 222 kicked off March, and that was when Sony actually
3384120	3385640	... This happened a little bit before.
3385640	3391100	The details were leaked before the Game Developers Conference, but episode 222, the first week
3391100	3394520	of March was when we really started getting the details on PlayStation Home.
3394520	3398680	And I think the thing about PlayStation Home was it kind of made our collective jaws drop
3398680	3402600	a little bit because at this point, a lot of us had really written off the PlayStation
3402600	3405720	3 as the joke of this generation.
3405720	3409720	And then when PlayStation Home was announced, a lot of us kind of turned our heads and went,
3409720	3410720	really?
3410720	3411720	Really now?
3411720	3412720	This looks interesting.
3412720	3413720	Yeah, it looks interesting.
3413720	3414720	I wish it would come out now.
3414720	3415720	Yeah.
3415720	3416720	Someday.
3416720	3420120	Of course, now as we know, the damn thing still hasn't come out, but as I said before,
3420120	3421920	I think Sony's spreading themselves too thin.
3421920	3426280	I think Home is still a great idea, and I can't wait to see it in 2008 or whenever it
3426280	3427280	finally comes out.
3427280	3428280	Yeah.
3428280	3429280	I don't know.
3429280	3433960	Dark Knight, do you think PlayStation Home is worthy of selling PlayStation 3s?
3433960	3434960	I don't know.
3434960	3437240	I mean, it's a good idea.
3437240	3443640	They try to give some second life feel to it and everything like that, but I don't think
3443640	3444640	it'll do it.
3444640	3445640	I don't think it'll work.
3445640	3447040	I don't think it'll do much good.
3447040	3449880	We'll see in 2008 when the thing finally comes out.
3449880	3454000	People like making their avatars and stuff, and to be honest, I wish Home was something
3454000	3459040	that Nintendo was doing with the Miis, because I think that would have really launched that
3459040	3460040	console.
3460040	3462920	I mean, not that they really needed any help selling the console, but it would have launched
3462920	3465840	it even further had they had difficulty or anything like that.
3465840	3466840	Yeah.
3466840	3470280	It would have worked on Nintendo maybe, but like I said, I can't see it as Sony.
3470280	3471280	It may have worked.
3471280	3472280	It would have worked on Nintendo.
3472280	3475880	But Home, I think, is one of those things, though, it looks good on paper, but I don't
3475880	3478520	know how it's actually going to translate once they've built it.
3478520	3479520	Yeah.
3479520	3483480	Well, let's move on with March, episode number 223.
3483480	3487720	Microsoft upped the arcade limit and subsequently the memory card sizes.
3487720	3491800	You might remember Xbox Live arcade games were limited to 50 megabytes, and at the Game
3491800	3495240	Developers Conference, I believe, Microsoft announced that they were going to be upping
3495240	3499740	the arcade limit, which allowed some more titles to come out that were much bigger,
3499740	3503080	such as Castlevania Symphony of the Night, I believe, was the first one that broke the
3503080	3504080	50 meg limit.
3504080	3506200	It was something like 90 megs.
3506200	3511680	And obviously, the memory card sizes had to be upgraded as well, which I certainly don't
3511680	3514200	think anybody sees this as a bad decision by Microsoft.
3514200	3516760	It was probably one they should have made a while ago.
3516760	3519780	Why they ever limited it in the first place was a little weird, but I guess it was because
3519780	3520780	of the memory cards.
3520780	3525360	Yeah, because I mean, and I don't think that many people actually bought them, like talking
3525360	3526360	about it.
3526360	3530400	Most of the people bought the 512 one only because it came with geometry wars in it.
3530400	3532640	Oh, I guess that's a good point.
3532640	3536440	Or you know, you just, you have the core and the memory cards all you need.
3536440	3540320	Like you know, I think most of the hardcore gamers like you and I and probably most of
3540320	3544520	the people that, you know, seek out gaming podcasts and therefore listen to this program,
3544520	3547340	we probably all understand why you need a hard drive.
3547340	3551800	But for those people that bought their Xbox 360s just so they could play Madden, you know,
3551800	3555940	have it be their party machine, I suppose, you know, memory cards are what they're going
3555940	3558440	to buy because that's what they're used to from PlayStation.
3558440	3559440	Right.
3559440	3560440	Right.
3560440	3565480	Well, and plus, like I said, the last system I remember, you know, the other system I had
3565480	3569060	that had a hard drive in it was the Sega Saturn.
3569060	3573240	So it was kind of like a take back when it saw that the 360, the newer systems would
3573240	3574240	have that.
3574240	3575960	What about the old school Xbox, though?
3575960	3578560	The first Xbox, they all had hard drives built in.
3578560	3579560	Yeah.
3579560	3580560	Oh, yeah, that's right.
3580560	3581560	I forgot they did.
3581560	3582560	Yeah.
3582560	3583560	Xbox One had hard drive.
3583560	3588120	Ironically enough, Xbox One didn't really use the hard drive, though, like it should
3588120	3589120	have.
3589120	3594720	It almost seems like Microsoft, when they originally conceptualized the original Xbox,
3594720	3597720	wanted to do some of the things from the very beginning that they didn't do until the Xbox
3597720	3598720	360.
3598720	3599720	It almost feels like that way.
3599720	3600720	Right?
3600720	3601720	Yeah.
3601720	3602720	I don't know.
3602720	3603720	I mean, it's just me.
3603720	3604720	Of course.
3604720	3605720	I think most of the people used it just to record music.
3605720	3608600	Just use their music and play CDs and whatnot and save it to the hard drive.
3608600	3610520	That's really all you could use it for.
3610520	3611520	Yeah.
3611520	3612520	Well.
3612520	3613520	Don't think.
3613520	3614520	Yeah.
3614520	3617880	Episode number 224 in March was pretty epic.
3617880	3624360	I swear to God, I looked at the list of stories we covered that week, and this really was
3624360	3629840	the one that kind of stuck out as the most relevant to what was going on in the games
3629840	3631440	industry in general at that time.
3631440	3637320	That is, episode 224 was the week that Loki revealed on this very program that there was
3637320	3641240	a game coming out called Beautiful Katamari that was going to be coming out later in the
3641240	3642240	year.
3642240	3648160	And the reason why I picked that is not necessarily the announcement itself, but all the fall
3648160	3649160	out.
3649160	3650160	The backlash.
3650160	3655600	The backlash that came from that because it definitely kind of showed A, can the independent
3655600	3661400	media be trusted, and who are these guys, and dah, dah, dah, and kind of B, when Namco
3661400	3665480	obviously, as most people know, it's not a very big secret now, now that the game's out,
3665480	3669740	I think we can talk a little more openly about this, Namco putteth the smacketh down a little
3669740	3674920	bit and there wasn't a lot we could do because we are an independent organization, because
3674920	3679880	this is something that is run out of our spare times, and because of the fact that we don't
3679880	3686580	have the mogul media companies to back us up and say, we're going to go fight you in
3686580	3689240	court over this, freedom of the press, blah, blah, blah.
3689240	3692760	We had to run away with our tail between our legs, and it kind of sucked.
3692760	3696600	It was, like I said, it wasn't the first time, remember the controversy with Kotaku and Sony
3696600	3701840	and how they said something about Sony, and Sony threatened to basically stop backing
3701840	3707520	them, and the community was up in arms about it, and they was up in arms about it, and
3707520	3712200	Sony was like, okay, okay, okay, we'll bend, we'll bend, we'll bend.
3712200	3716720	It hurt, it was just, nothing's worse than a community scorn.
3716720	3723440	But unfortunately, we don't have that same oomph that Kotaku has, it just kind of sucks,
3723440	3728560	but it definitely was a very interesting thing to watch, I'm sure, you know, it was a hell
3728560	3731680	of a thing to see from the inside, I'm sure on the outside it was probably pretty interesting
3731680	3732680	too.
3732680	3733680	Oh yeah, oh yeah.
3733680	3736680	Like I said, I mean, I do my own show, and I'm just like, oh, own show, I'm kind of sketchy
3736680	3741240	on most of the release news, I'm like, eh, do I want to really touch that or no?
3741240	3745880	Hey, I figured it's not that important anymore, especially since all the releases changed
3745880	3747920	so much anyways.
3747920	3750680	But I guess for whatever reason, they were really trying to keep that under wraps.
3750680	3752400	Yeah, they were really trying to keep under wraps.
3752400	3754840	Well, they didn't do a very good job, or we wouldn't have found it.
3754840	3758040	Yeah, they were really, they should really keep it under wraps that a PlayStation 3 and
3758040	3760600	Wii version are coming out in April, that would really hurt.
3760600	3761600	Welcome!
3761600	3762600	You're awesome.
3762600	3763600	We're going to jail.
3763600	3764600	Alright.
3764600	3769960	Views and opinions expressed by Loki, please don't sue us.
3769960	3774160	Episode number 225, there was one more episode that came out in March, and that was the episode
3774160	3779320	where Devil May Cry 4 was announced that it will no longer be a PlayStation 3 exclusive,
3779320	3785040	and obviously that had a big impact because that kind of left Metal Gear Solid 4 and Final
3785040	3792040	Fantasy 13 as the only real triple-A, super-grade-A PlayStation 3 exclusives left.
3792040	3796080	I mean, this was huge the week that this one was announced, because it was like, oh my
3796080	3800440	gosh, one of the big three just jumped ship, and it's now going to be Xbox 360.
3800440	3804240	And now, flashing forward to where we're at now, not only is it also coming out on the
3804240	3809920	Xbox 360, but they're making bundles out of it in Japan, the whole Devil May Cry bundles
3809920	3811560	now are coming out.
3811560	3814400	Devil May Cry for 360 if he doesn't get one.
3814400	3822080	I mean, don't get me wrong, I saw a preview of the game in it, it's going to look good.
3822080	3824040	It does look pretty awesome, I'm going to have to check it out.
3824040	3827560	I've never really followed the Devil May Cry series that closely, but this game may have
3827560	3828560	to make me change my mind.
3828560	3833160	It has one thing going for it so far, the return of Trish.
3833160	3834640	Jamie's happy.
3834640	3839800	All right, well, Dark Knight, out of those four stories, the unveiling of PlayStation
3839800	3845040	Home, Microsoft upping the arcade limit, beautiful Katamari being spoiled by us, and Devil May
3845040	3847520	Cry 4 no longer being a PlayStation 3 exclusive.
3847520	3850640	Which one do you think had the most impact in 2007?
3850640	3856720	I'd say the Katamari spoiler thing, because like I said, it was just basically eye-opening
3856720	3861840	to everybody that let them know that, yeah, this really not only could affect the big
3861840	3866760	guys but it could affect the money guys and leak a story like that and have somebody go,
3866760	3868220	no, you might want to...
3868220	3873520	And I know because of our announcement, those sales of Katamari have been so horrible just
3873520	3877120	because of our announcement.
3877120	3878360	You know what's weird?
3878360	3880880	I actually wouldn't have picked the same story myself.
3880880	3881880	I wouldn't have.
3881880	3884680	I would have went with the Devil May Cry story, but that's all right.
3884680	3889400	I mean, like I said, when I heard the aftermath about it, I was stunned.
3889400	3896680	I was like, wow, but it did kind of show that y'all had enough clout to get that much attention.
3896680	3899520	All right, well, there you have it.
3899520	3901520	Loki, Dark Soccer, do you agree?
3901520	3903080	Was that the biggest story in March?
3903080	3907220	Were we the biggest story in March, or are we just being egotistical here?
3907220	3909400	I agree actually with the Devil May Cry thing.
3909400	3911520	You think Devil May Cry was a weird story?
3911520	3913520	I don't know about Devil May Cry 4.
3913520	3918960	I'm like, yeah, Devil May Cry 4 is on 360 and PS3, oh, good for them.
3918960	3926680	I think that it's more or less the total public recognition by another company that, well,
3926680	3929780	maybe the PlayStation 3 is a piece of shit.
3929780	3930780	That's what it was for me, too.
3930780	3933360	I would have worded that strongly, but yes.
3933360	3936760	We want people to actually buy our game, so we're going to put it on a system that people
3936760	3937760	are buying.
3937760	3940960	I think that's what it was for me, is that that's the way I would phrase it, is that
3940960	3944280	it was really a company kind of acknowledging, hmm, Sony ain't selling the way we thought
3944280	3945280	it would.
3945280	3947040	We're going to have to go put this game out on Microsoft as well.
3947040	3952520	Or they figured out, hey, guess what, it isn't that hard to develop for the 360 and the PlayStation
3952520	3953880	3 at the same time.
3953880	3955360	Pretty easy to port the code over.
3955360	3956360	Let's do that.
3956360	3957360	Exactly.
3957360	3958360	All right.
3958360	3962880	I went through a bonus one and said basically, um, Stranglehold having so much expectation
3962880	3964280	it ended up being a bust.
3964280	3967960	Oh, that's right, Stranglehold was released in March, huh, I remember that.
3967960	3968960	No wonder.
3968960	3969960	Was it?
3969960	3970960	Was it?
3970960	3971960	Was it March or later?
3971960	3972960	I think it was in the Sunday release.
3972960	3973960	That was in like September and October.
3973960	3974960	Was it?
3974960	3975960	Yeah.
3975960	3976960	But it seemed like this game, like it was at E3.
3976960	3979400	Like a year and a half ago.
3979400	3980400	And then, all right.
3980400	3986080	It was supposed to be like a release title for the 360 at one point the way they showed
3986080	3987080	it.
3987080	3990960	I probably was originally supposed to come out in March and got delayed that whole time.
3990960	3991960	That might be true, but.
3991960	3992960	All right.
3992960	3993960	Well, anyway.
3993960	3994960	Let's talk about April.
3994960	4000040	Episode 226 kicked off April and one of the top stories from that episode was the announcement
4000040	4004400	that Sonic and Mario were going to be teaming up for a new game, Mario and Sonic at the
4004400	4005560	Olympics.
4005560	4006560	And nobody cared.
4006560	4007560	Dared.
4007560	4008560	Well, hold on.
4008560	4009560	Exactly.
4009560	4013120	Now they don't because after the game came out, I don't think most people cared anymore,
4013120	4016280	but the week this was announced, this was huge news.
4016280	4019560	That's kind of why I bring this up because people were like, OMG, Sonic and Mario.
4019560	4023060	But now, you know, obviously since then, we've had Sonic be announced in Brawl and all that
4023060	4024120	stuff too.
4024120	4028540	You know, it's not such a big deal, but at the time, it was like, OMG, my childhood,
4028540	4033280	you know, fantasies in some way or, you know, the thing you never thought would happen is
4033280	4034280	happening.
4034280	4035280	Sonic and Mario in the same game.
4035280	4036280	True.
4036280	4037920	That was a big announcement.
4037920	4041240	Episode number 227 in April, that was the week that Rock Band was announced and that
4041240	4044000	was probably our biggest story we talked about that week because obviously Rock Band was
4044000	4050000	a very ambitious game that ended up on many people's game of the year list for 2007.
4050000	4051000	Will it end up on ours?
4051000	4052000	We'll see.
4052000	4057160	But yeah, Rock Band was announced that week and, you know, I think to an extent, I think
4057160	4038460	the reason why this was noteworthy is that for us, especially here at Orange
4038460	4054720	that was a big announcement.
4054720	4056880	And that was probably our biggest story we talked about that week because obviously Rock
4056880	4060720	Band was a very ambitious game that ended up on many people's game of the year list
4060720	4062520	for 2007.
4062520	4066360	a lot of us were caught off guard at just how ambitious this game was because
4066360	4068800	I think for a lot of us I don't know about you guys but for me I was like
4068800	4073600	they're gonna do guitar, drums, and singing like all in one game that's it
4073600	4077520	was like it's kind of it was like a big thing because I I would think that
4077520	4080680	nobody would have never thought of something like this being conjoined
4080680	4086400	together for one game other than like the drum mania guitar freaks thing right
4086400	4088940	and I think that's what it was for me is that you know obviously had guitar
4088940	4092440	freaks drum mania keyboard mania in the arcades years ago it just kind of
4092440	4096320	surprised me that it was like whoa somebody's actually gonna try and do
4096320	4099360	this in the US and they are gonna put it all in one game and they're gonna put it
4099360	4103800	all in one box and see if it sells that's that is fucking ambitious right
4103800	4110080	there. And the ultimate kicker was they had a singing part to it
4110080	4114560	and that was the ultimate kicker the ultimate breakdown was that you put
4114560	4119480	singing into it it was like a big it was like a big deal especially with the
4119480	4126360	populated karaoke games. All right. Hey, Loki, say hey. episode number 228 a story that
4126360	4130680	definitely stuck out for us in episode 228 a woman who played on the game World
4130680	4136960	of Warcraft posted an ad on Craigslist offering sex to get the gold to buy her
4136960	4141800	epic mount that's right it was the woman who will make an epic mount for an epic
4141800	4146120	mount that's right she was the woman who would mount for a mount and obviously
4146120	4149240	enough said here I mean this got people talking about you know where do you draw
4149240	4153320	the freaking line seriously I mean this this had a lot of people talking about I
4153320	4158120	would I would be curious what that woman's up to now like you know did she
4158120	4162040	do it again? I got one to top of that actually I think I've never talked about it how
4162040	4166720	about once I mean what probably has happened an Australian lady met a young
4166720	4172640	teenager online through W.I.L.B. paid her way to come to America to visit him
4172640	4176120	I remember I do remember hearing about this I think we might have covered this
4176120	4180320	on the show but yeah it's similar it's a similar story yeah in some ways just
4180320	4184760	crazy what some people get into on Wow but you know I gotta say as a World of
4184760	4188440	Warcraft player those epic mounts really are a bitch to get I mean I almost am
4188440	4193560	ready to put out to get one and that's why I don't touch that game not really
4193560	4197800	though I'm just kidding all right and then episode 229 was the last episode we
4197800	4201560	taped in April it actually must have been a slow news week because the top
4201560	4205160	story I pulled from that one is that the PlayStation I was officially announced
4205160	4208760	but actually I think the reason why this is relevant is because obviously you
4208760	4214280	know a lot of us are kind of wondering you know Sony showed this off at you
4214280	4219120	know e3 and it disappeared for the longest time we never heard anything
4219120	4222440	about the eye of judgment and suddenly out of nowhere bam here it is the
4222440	4225280	PlayStation eyes coming out and I think this might have been the episode where
4225280	4228560	Loki made the bet I don't remember it might have been over the summer it was
4228560	4232280	later late all right but regardless the PlayStation I was officially announced
4232280	4238880	in episode 229 so I mean like it just it seemed like the news was pretty slow I
4238880	4243840	think what I'm trying to remember when I debut because I think I did I think I
4243840	4249720	was working on that when I was like guys not much gaming this week hey it
4249720	4252800	happens sometimes when you do we show sometimes that's why we play games
4252800	4257200	sometimes that was a match game week all right anyway Dark Knight I'm out of
4257200	4260840	those four stories Sonic and Mario team up rock band announced a woman in World
4260840	4264080	of Warcraft puts out for her mount and the PlayStation I officially announced
4264080	4268120	what do you think had the biggest impact in gaming from April uh I would probably
4268120	4273200	have to say at first I was thinking about the Mario and Sonic thing but to
4273200	4278320	be honest I think the World of Warcraft ain't just me on the grounds of it
4278320	4284800	involved it involves sex for legal prostitution yeah yeah basically she
4284800	4287960	said right virtually you're picking it because it's a story that involves sex
4287960	4296120	which is fine but it is it is kind of an instance of taking your games way way
4296120	4300680	way too seriously right I mean like other than what happened later on in the
4300680	4304920	years that made it worse and brought everything back ahead again I think the
4304920	4308360	reason why that is important to gaming in general in 2007 because I think
4308360	4311680	ninety nine point nine percent of people looked at that story and went I don't
4311680	4316160	want that to be me ever like even the most hardcore gamers were like I do not
4316160	4321520	want that to be me ever a way to keep us in check all right but here's the
4321520	4325880	kicker though yeah I hate to bring political politics into this but mm-hmm
4325880	4329600	I don't know if y'all heard but apparently a presidential candidate done
4329600	4337200	scheduled a parade and Wow it was recently this is recent or I think it's
4337200	4343640	a recent Ron Paul riffing interesting Ron Paul was going to Ron Paul
4343640	4347120	apparently he got some people or somebody might set it up I don't know
4347120	4353480	apparently he got they're gonna do like a little campaigning parade on Wow I
4353480	4358480	forgot what thinking from Iron Forge to some area and whatnot and I was like
4358480	4363560	wow they definitely they definitely having the goal to go for this one I
4363560	4367760	remember jokingly said um great if this pulls off they're gonna win the nerd
4367760	4374160	vote Wow no I know it's gonna be a hell of a year honestly this is about as cool
4374160	4387600	as dr. evil in Austin Powers I'm hip I'm cool he's like look see I'm hippie cool
4387600	4395240	I know what World of Warcraft is vote for me I mean that's pretty much it look
4395240	4399120	how easy you can piss the gamers off you know and there's a lot of gamers over 18
4399120	4402860	who are voters you know somebody like you know Hillary Clinton you know she's
4402860	4405760	a big presidential candidate she's pissed a lot of people off with her
4405760	4409360	stance and she kind of remember she backtracked like earlier in the year she
4409360	4412440	was kind of more anti-video game and then she kind of came out and supported
4412440	4416120	the ESRB a little later and said you know we've done a lot of work and that
4416120	4423120	it uh it's very interesting and then when I was waiting for your vote well I
4423120	4426360	can say is 2008 it's gonna be a hell of a year with the election going on and
4426360	4430560	everything dark knight let's let's hear it what do you think in your opinion was
4430560	4435960	the worst game of 2007 I had to agree with Davis dolphin animals yards I
4435960	4440460	played it once and never touched it again or base that I basically gave it
4440460	4445000	the what the hell was I smoking when I played this game award there you go well
4445000	4450980	in your opinion what was the hands-down above all best freaking game of 2007
4450980	4458000	guys so many games but I had to go with Call of Duty 4 because the game basically
4458000	4461520	could the big game could basically be turned into a movie by itself you
4461520	4464200	wouldn't need no actors that you wouldn't need no actors or anything like
4464200	4469440	that just put the game in let it run its course it's the Oscar hit I think as I'd
4469440	4474160	heard somebody describe Call of Duty 4 it's just fucking epic it is it's just
4474160	4480040	fucking epic talk to best best person that asked about that talk to Travis I
4480040	4486160	will I will he's a veteran he'll tell you which by the way Travis was here
4486160	4490640	last week when we weren't here and did it did a heck of a show I gotta say so
4490640	4494800	check that out out there yeah check that out at under station live dot org it's
4494800	4498680	it's something else or he's on his new is he's on a new site now right Travis
4498680	4503280	Travis Donovan Donovan live that's right but it's unknown but I think is and I
4503280	4508960	think he did put the episode under under sedation nice cuz like I said I was there
4508960	4514560	trust me I was part of that shenanigans that episode so lots of fun good times
4514560	4517720	well dark night we gotta let you go but thanks so much for participating tonight

4526480	4530440	somebody else to join us talk about we're gonna do May and June I know it's
4530440	4533040	a little different for we have there but since we're giving everybody two months
4533040	4536520	we'll go ahead and do man June we got somebody on the line hi who's there yo
4536520	4539960	it's Enoch or from the ultimate quest I guess what is up xeno core how you doing
4539960	4543880	yeah I'm still alive you know paying bills and such how was your holiday
4543880	4551080	good I got two shirts very close to yeah man all right clothing is good that's
4551080	4555040	right keeps you warm during these cold months Christmas is intended to give you
4555040	4559760	underwear and socks how are things over the ultimate quest you guys doing your
4559760	4563560	own year and wrap up uh yeah we pretty much finished our shows for the year
4563560	4568360	we're going on hiatus for the new year so I can get inebriated at least and
4568360	4574000	but we'll be picking up next year I think the first weekend in January will
4574000	4577600	be starting up again so I gotta pass a message along to footy monster I don't
4577600	4580180	know if he's listening tonight or what but footy monster obviously one of the
4580180	4583280	other co-hosts on over on ultimate quest which is a fellow all games affiliate
4583280	4587080	including us we broadcast on all games Monday nights and Tuesday mornings I
4587080	4592320	gotta say this there is a new addition to our co-host in the back and you can
4592320	4595480	only see him on operator 11 when we're up in the feeds over for right now but
4595480	4599600	when it comes back up notice this we have a new penguin in the back it's a
4599600	4604920	little blow-up penguin that penguin is actually from Argentina my by roommate
4604920	4607760	sister was just there in Argentina and brought me back this blow-up penguin
4607760	4610840	that I guess was in some type of snowboard shop and his name is Guido the
4610840	4613680	penguin and she photographed him at all these beautiful places throughout
4613680	4616920	Argentina and gave me the little book for Christmas along with the blow-up
4616920	4620160	penguin I thought it was just such a creative gift it's awesome so that's
4620160	4623320	pretty cool I'm not sure to pass that message along I thought footy would get
4623320	4627120	a kick out of that because sometimes you know Argentina is a huge fucking country
4627120	4630840	but it doesn't get mentioned enough usually and you know because because the
4630840	4635720	gaming scene just isn't it isn't what it is here there you know what I mean it's
4635720	4639440	not it is very different as very because he lets us know very much so on the
4639440	4643640	show all right well enough about people who aren't here let's talk about the
4643640	4649320	year in review and talk a little bit about did you kill the fly Loki thank
4649320	4654200	you no there's there has been two flies in here bugging the shit out of us all
4654200	4657480	night long we're about ready to scream all right anyway sorry to rail a little
4657480	4663360	bit let's talk about may may started off with episode number 230 PETA got pissed
4663360	4668640	off and PETA not of course the type of PETA that you eat but PETA being the
4668640	4673040	people for ethical treatment of animals they got pissed off here's why they got
4673040	4676800	pissed off do you remember when Sony did their God of War promotion in Europe and
4676800	4682560	they actually killed a live goat yeah man muttons good for you oh my gosh and
4682560	4685760	PETA of understandably was pissed off about that and the rest of us were
4685760	4690000	wondering what the F were they thinking having the I don't know if I don't think
4690000	4693360	they actually killed the goat live but they had the dead goat like everywhere
4693360	4699520	and it was just kind of like what the crap are you people thinking yep it was
4699520	4703040	pretty humorous it's like they were did he at least make mutton or stew out of
4703040	4705560	it or anything he just had a dead carcass right there smelling of the
4705560	4710720	place mm-hmm mm-hmm awesome Oh at footy monsters actually in Chad he just he
4710720	4716680	just said something about Guido that's funny anyway sorry I got distracted all
4716680	4721120	right episode number 231 hey you'd like this as a roleplay fan one of the
4721120	4725400	stories that stuck out from episode 231 Final Fantasy 4 was announced that it
4725400	4729600	was going to be remade for the DS and not just you know this is much different
4729600	4732160	from what Squeenix had been doing with the past Final Fantasy games and
4732160	4736480	releasing them but they were going to remake all of Final Fantasy 4 similar to
4736480	4740880	how they did with Final Fantasy 3 and now the game is out in Japan we're still
4740880	4746360	waiting for it here in the u.s. but certainly I had people thinking you know
4746360	4749040	different ways about that what do you think about the Final Fantasy 4 remake
4749040	4754160	on the DS well I'm all for the remakes when they switch to another console that
4754160	4757840	was not previously and they're just gonna you know print more money once it
4757840	4762560	gets released over there but there's some news with the sequel but I won't go
4762560	4767200	too much into that but it's a it's a win for Nintendo so why not I I you know and
4767200	4771560	I was I was very hesitant about this I was like oh god this is like my favorite
4771560	4775440	Final Fantasy game I'm like one of a very few amount of people where Final
4775440	4778720	Fantasy 4 really is like my favorite Final Fantasy game and that probably is
4778720	4782400	mostly sentimental value go in there but it really is like my favorite one and
4782400	4786680	I'm just like please please Square Enix do not fuck this up but then when I saw
4786680	4789560	the you know screen caps and the previews I'm like wow this actually
4789560	4793720	looks pretty awesome yep so the cane stragoon jump for the win yeah looking
4793720	4798600	for oh it's gonna be great episode 232 big week for PC gamers because that was
4798600	4803240	the week that Starcraft 2 was announced and Blizzard reviving one of their
4803240	4806120	franchises they've been a little bit dormant I mean obviously we had the
4806120	4809800	rumors of Starcraft ghosts years ago and everybody kind of thought you know this
4809800	4812600	had to come eventually and finally it arrived in May the announcement of
4812600	4820240	Starcraft 2 episode 233 was the one we taped live at Fonami and that was the
4820240	4826200	week that the Super Smash Brothers brawl news really started to pour in and
4826200	4829640	namely this is the one that was revealed that they were gonna be having tons of
4829640	4833640	returning musicians you basically had all these people that had contributed to
4833640	4837440	other Nintendo games we're gonna be creating songs for Super Smash Brothers
4837440	4841520	and remaking your old classics and you know obviously you can hear a lot of it
4841520	4846960	on the official Smash Brothers site and just a lot of good stuff I mean it do
4846960	4848800	you think brawls gonna live up to the hype
4848800	4854440	Xenocore that's a rough one cuz it is getting quite a lot of hype I mean it
4854440	4859200	just whenever I start seeing games advertise this much I just expect it to
4859200	4863360	fall short a certain degree just you know just from process of elimination
4863360	4866420	over the years you know whenever again gets hyped up and always fall short one
4866420	4870360	or two spots so if it does I'm gonna be surprised but if it does not then all
4870360	4874720	better and you know especially if it is true what Loki said earlier you know and
4874720	4878040	it does turn to be true that the game gets delayed another month it's gonna
4878040	4882240	have to be that much better to make it worth all they're gonna yeah that's a
4882240	4885480	first-party game so it's not gonna get relate release when it's complete crap
4885480	4889520	there's no way true true well okay out of those stories of PETA and the God of
4889520	4893960	War go go Final Fantasy 4 remake Starcraft 2 announced and Super Smash
4893960	4897200	Brothers revealed what do you think was the story that had the biggest impact in
4897200	4900840	gaming or if you have something else you want to throw in there go for it no
4900840	4905600	mainly I'd go with the the story with the guard of war carcass just because it
4905600	4908800	spills over to mainstream media when you see stuff like that and it brings
4908800	4913600	attention to the gaming and world and not a good kind of attention yeah it's
4913600	4917120	definitely bad attention I have to agree with you there that's probably what I
4917120	4921040	would pick to definitely would pick that one all right let's move on to June we
4921040	4923880	only take three shows in June I don't know what happened I guess we were we
4923880	4927040	fell asleep or maybe another Disneyland trip happened in there I'm not sure is
4927040	4931240	it was there all right well there were three shows taped in June episode 234
4931240	4934760	that was the week I love this that was the week that Ubisoft apologized for
4934760	4938880	making crappy Wii games do you remember that one that they said you know what
4938880	4944480	maybe we shouldn't have done so many ports just just to have a game company
4944480	4948560	even though I'm you know obviously this was an off comment that some executive
4948560	4952480	said they got turned into this whole you know Oh Ubisoft is apologizing for their
4952480	4956800	crappy games even the fact that they even remotely went there was definitely
4956800	4960560	newsworthy I gotta say because they did make a lot of crappy Wii games in the
4960560	4966840	beginning episode 235 that was the week that Sony finally after all that time
4966840	4972500	finally launched their semi-official blog three speak finally that was
4972500	4976720	launched in June of 2007 and obviously Sony had been kind of trying to catch up
4976720	4981400	you might remember from the year before all I want for Xmas is a PSP calm and
4981400	4986880	remember that didn't go so well that time and so most people were saying you
4986880	4991120	know what Sony really needs like a major Nelson you know Nintendo has their
4991120	4996000	poster kids with Miyamoto and Reggie Fils-Aime you know Microsoft has you
4996000	4999020	know major Nelson and Trixie and people that are out there in the community
4999020	5006440	Sony's got crazy crayon-eaten-ken if they hired me I bet you I could sell ps3
5006440	5011240	how would you sell a PlayStation 3 first of all I'd restore it to its original
5011240	5015960	format mm-hmm but I would have it with all of the goodie stuff and a 40 gig
5015960	5019800	hard drive mm-hmm it would not even have the option of having more yes but how
5019800	5024120	would you sell it what would that commercial look like boobs just just
5024120	5030560	women jumping on trampolines is that what it would be no you can have graphics
5030560	5037880	this realistic oh my god okay that is a brilliant idea for a commercial just all
5037880	5042760	the commercial is is 30 seconds of boobs on trampolines and then in the very last
5042760	5048840	second it says generated by PlayStation 3 this is all real baby should be working
5048840	5060200	for Spike TV or or have like a shoe like barbecue because nothing will sell a
5060200	5066240	game like boobs and barbecue Mac man says in chat room Jamie would just tape a
5066240	5070640	ferret to every PlayStation 3 free ferret with every game and Dark Knight
5070640	5075120	wants to remember how did that crayon-eating bit even start Megsy that's
5075120	5078640	right one of the OMR lesbians started the crayon-eating thing that's right
5078640	5082200	captain Crayola starts at Suya says all right well anyhow out of those three
5082200	5085920	stories or if you have one of your own Xenocore Ubisoft apologizes Sony
5085920	5088400	launches their own blood oh I'm sorry I didn't even read the third and third one
5088400	5094560	episode 236 was the week that manhunt 2 officially got the AO rating and of
5094560	5100280	course this just began weeks upon weeks of oh my gosh when will this news end
5100280	5104160	about manhunt 2 and of course you know it didn't happen the same week but you
5104160	5109760	know you subsequently was banned by the British board and so on and so on I mean
5109760	5113200	enough said manhunt 2 got the AO rating and had to go back for repairs and
5113200	5116800	that's why the game got delayed to Halloween side of those three stories
5116800	5120680	Ubisoft apologizing Sony launching their official blog and manhunt 2 getting the
5120680	5123600	ratings in a core what do you think biggest impact it's got it's got to be
5123600	5127560	the manhunt 2 story I mean that that went all across the globe on that one
5127560	5131280	hands down absolutely everything else kind of pales in comparison that might
5131280	5134600	because that story just kind of like the lady who died from drinking the Wii and
5134600	5137320	the pita stuff and all the other stuff most people have named so far she drank
5137320	5144200	the Wii she drank all the water for the Wii drink we for a week now that's a
5144200	5151680	contest I'd like to see who's willing to drink their we for a week it really is
5151680	5158240	although although although you can use P as a I don't I don't I always think I
5158240	5162000	think back to when I watch survivor years ago and there was a guy there was
5162000	5166600	the guy going the the stingray just bit me I need someone to pee on it and so
5166600	5170200	this lady goes over squats on him and pees on it and sure enough disinfects it
5170200	5175360	but it's really better with your own pee because it breaks down the proteins in
5175360	5178920	the in the toxin it's just remember the guys there I need someone to pee on it
5178920	5184600	I mean tenderizer works too sorry anyhow well seen a court let's not topic
5184600	5189400	talking about I'm such discussing potty humor and let's get to the good stuff
5189400	5192880	and that would be in your opinions in a car what was the worst freaking game of
5192880	5201720	2007 the worst game of 2007 mmm I mean it's too easy it's too easy of a target
5201720	5204920	I was trying to think of something else but it did nothing comes to mind yards
5204920	5208280	needs to go whoever developed it needs to have their names published so they
5208280	5211840	can't get another job in the aiming industry so simple as that three out of
5211840	5217440	three of named Yaris is I have a stick and it's not Yaris ah I can't think of
5217440	5221600	another one out we gotta save everything I'm actually gonna tell you the last
5221600	5226960	issue of Xbox magazine was listing Yaris as a piece of crap into the official
5226960	5231240	Xbox magazine even how sad how nice all right well let's get to the good stuff
5231240	5236480	Xenocore in your opinion the best freaking game of 2007 okay I'll probably
5236480	5240440	get more hate mail for that but it gives me more to read on the show but uh yeah
5240440	5247160	I got to say portals the best game of the year why I'm surprised that I I was
5247160	5251320	I was waiting to write persona 3 as an RPG player I would have thought that was
5251320	5255460	gonna be your pick but why portal because it's the most innovative title
5255460	5260000	period everybody else is doing something that's really been done before I mean as
5260000	5263800	good as Super Mario Galaxy is ratcheting clank beat him to the market with it
5263800	5267720	rather or not they've developed it already Bioshock was a big
5267720	5270960	disappointment for me it was good in the beginning but it sucked at the end and
5270960	5274960	in hindsight it's like what what's all this stuff you know so I threw Bioshock
5274960	5278400	to the side and the others just didn't make a big of an impact this portal I
5278400	5282160	can still go back and play portal now well point gets to win you never know
5282160	5285580	Xenocore we're gonna be recapping our picks later in the show and I'll bet you
5285580	5288640	at least one of the three of us agrees with you that portal was the best game
5288640	5293520	in 2007 but we'll find out for sure you never know surprises there are many
5293520	5296320	so we'll get to that a little later in the show but Xenocore thank you so much
5296320	5300040	for joining us and we always have appreciated your calls throughout 2007
5300040	5303620	best of luck to you and the whole crew at the ultimate quest for 2008 all right
5303620	5308280	yeah no problem thanks a lot guys all right take care buddy bye bye
5308280	5311820	that was Xenocore ladies and gentlemen helping us recap May and June and so
5311820	5315560	we're halfway through the year I think it's about time we take ourselves a
5315560	5318120	little bit of a break don't you guys think we have to take a break here
5318120	5322720	pretty soon sure but there's one more thing we need to take care of before we
5322720	5325640	go to break because we are getting to the end of part a and what happens at
5325640	5333560	the end of part a that's right it's time for Dark Sakura's classic game of the
5333560	5338280	week the chance for her to respect the elders actually I believe tonight is a
5338280	5342800	very special edition because if I'm not mistaken tonight is the classic game of
5342800	5348960	the year I shot she's nodding yes it is the classic game of the year so you
5348960	5352280	need to check this shit out because this is gonna be this is gonna be epic
5352280	5355480	whatever she picks tonight and let's hear it
5355480	5361000	Dark Sakura what is the classic game of the year the classic game of the year is
5361000	5367000	one of the best games ever in the universe it's Parodius Da Shinwakara
5367000	5374000	Owariye which translates to my nose is all stuffed up it translates to Parodius
5374000	5383520	from Myth to Laughter and the version that I have for our music is the PC
5383520	5390080	engine release of it because honestly and I've played through the Super
5390080	5396000	Famicom one it lags so badly it has bad liquor and slow down because it's a lot
5396000	5402520	of stuff to process via the the PC engine did it better but this is as you
5402520	5407600	can probably tell from the name Parodius is a parody of Gradius it actually is
5407600	5414440	the second one in the series the first Parodius came out on the MSX system but
5414440	5417560	in this one you get to play you've actually got your different power-up
5417560	5421960	abilities based on what character you pick you can play the Vic Viper from
5421960	5427120	Gradius you can play an octopus you can play a Twinbee this is the one where you
5427120	5431760	fight the stripper you they're the Vegas showgirl whatever she is yeah oh my god I
5431760	5437520	remember this one by going in between her legs now why did Parodius never come
5437520	5442160	out in the u.s. it came out in Europe but why never here were we just not I
5442160	5448280	mean showgirl thing we just want to get too far up their ass so basically I mean
5448280	5451320	and for those of you that may be kind of looking at Jamie right now going what
5451320	5454440	the heck why are you picking this type thing you really do have to imagine this
5454440	5458720	game is Gradius on crack yeah and what makes this game so freaking epic is just
5458720	5464120	the fact that that I think it was mostly ignored here in the u.s. Moai stage
5464120	5468480	because you know kami games have to have the Moai head in there absolutely but
5468480	5473120	the way that the the power-ups worked I thought it was cool the Vic Viper is the
5473120	5479160	old-school Gradius config the octopus is the salamander configuration Twinbee is
5479160	5483720	the Twinbee configuration even with the rocket with the the punching fists and
5483720	5489960	pants Haro is Gradius three I always would play as a Twinbee because I love
5489960	5493360	the rocket fist but it's also really cool and the one that we're watching is
5493360	5496080	actually the Vic Viper playing through because you get the option and double
5496080	5500160	it's just like gradius to when you play it that way and the thing that my
5500160	5502960	favorite weapon in the whole thing maybe this is a reason why I didn't come out
5502960	5506480	because of the Eagle I noticed that the boss monster is being fought right now
5506480	5512360	is an American Eagle wearing a Yankee hat and little bow tie it just exploded
5512360	5520240	well um a little bit more is that you one of your power-ups in the game is a
5520240	5525000	bell and you keep shooting the bell and like if you shoot the if you get a blue
5525000	5528960	bell it'll make your character grow big and anything it touches will be
5528960	5533400	destroyed if you get a green one it's a big flare and destroys everything on the
5533400	5539680	screen including most bosses and that's actually how you beat the naked lady you
5539680	5543640	one of the people that you fight is this woman wearing a sheet and when you shoot
5543640	5552760	she goes angels at you bubbles in fact here's a here's a picture of her on the
5552760	5558920	wiki I'll link it in the chat room nice nice um but she's really freaking hard
5558920	5561320	to beat so you have to usually have to have the mega flare by there but they
5561320	5565600	always give you a bell right before that stage my favorite of those is the gray
5565600	5570400	bell which shouts words like the whole phrase is like you know I think one of
5570400	5574280	them is the equivalent of like eat at Joe's and another one is equals NC
5574280	5581920	squared and now this is actually not my favorite in the parodius series my
5581920	5587520	favorite is a GQO Shabari Parodius which you can play on Saturn and that's the
5587520	5592200	one that has and for anyone who wants to know that means chatting pretty aside
5592200	5597960	for anyone who wants to know it has the miracle OOP of it has the penguins
5597960	5602160	Pantero and Hanako twin be and win be that your Viper and Lord British from
5602160	5608200	Gradius not to be confused with Richard Garriott yeah right okay and it has
5608200	5616320	some girls writing on a missile and now it has I assume quite soon which for
5616320	5620880	anyone who ever played um Yu-Gi-Oh there's cards for them there are these
5620880	5626720	little stickmen writing on paper airplanes but I just think that it's
5626720	5632040	pretty cool had so much stuff going on and the other one in the series was
5632040	5639240	there was sexy Parodius and Paro Wars and I also saw last night and I mean if
5639240	5644080	you can hear on the thing a lot of the levels we mix Gradius music to start or
5644080	5653760	salamander music and then play classical music like so um but uh last night I was
5653760	5657800	looking at YouTube trying to find you know because we obviously play the the
5657800	5666140	sound off of YouTube that way but I found the Parodius pachinko machine
5666140	5673000	videos nice and one of the there's even like this little model show with the the
5673000	5679000	bunny suit girls is girls in bunny outfits writing on missiles and then
5679000	5685520	you the the the showgirl was one of them stomping through the city and it's it was
5685520	5690080	just really cool I was like so we at least still have the Parodius franchise
5690080	5694680	still alive I would like to see a new Parodius really bad all right or some
5694680	5698000	folks have chatter saying Parodius on virtual console especially with the fact
5698000	5701000	that we do happy we do know they will put Japanese games that were once
5701000	5704600	Japanese only they have been releasing over here like Mario Brothers 2 the
5704600	5713200	original I think everybody is you know smart enough to just get over it I know
5713200	5717800	really it's not a big deal the reason why I like I'm very pretty is that one
5717800	5720360	of the bad guys in it is actually supposed to be one of the girls from
5720360	5726120	Tokimeki Memorial the the long-term dating sim nice yeah well there it is
5726120	5731520	folks your classic game of the year Parodius da in this case on the PC
5731520	5736480	engine but you know it's it's out there for multiple systems so very good pick
5736480	5740600	Jamie this game always cracks me up every time I watch it because Parodius
5740600	5743520	is an awesome game and where was this game in the Parodius collection that's
5743520	5747360	what I would like to know I know right but I think there was like I think there
5747360	5750280	was another I actually want to say that all of them have been released on
5750280	5756240	Saturn except for the MSX one well coming up in part B on tonight's program
