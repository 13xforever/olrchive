00:00.000 --> 00:19.520
Tonight, December 9th, 2007, new details emerge on Street Fighter IV.

00:19.520 --> 00:35.840
Nintendo gets a ninja party next year, and this game tap started removing games?

00:35.840 --> 00:49.840
We are that gaming show, podcast, blogcast, Zoom cast, whatever you're into, thing dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

00:49.840 --> 00:51.840
My name is Rob Roberts. Welcome back to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

00:51.840 --> 00:52.840
Hi.

00:52.840 --> 00:53.840
How are you doing, Jamie?

00:53.840 --> 00:55.840
I'm almost full.

00:55.840 --> 00:59.840
Yes, almost what you've been eating, of course, in traditional Jamie tradition.

00:59.840 --> 01:01.840
I pick up my dinner on the way to the show.

01:01.840 --> 01:02.840
That's good, that's good.

01:02.840 --> 01:04.840
Otherwise, I would have just had beans.

01:04.840 --> 01:08.840
I cram food in after the show before I go to bed, which is probably how I got fat.

01:08.840 --> 01:12.840
It's not very healthy. You should not eat three hours before you go to bed.

01:12.840 --> 01:14.840
It isn't, and then I shouldn't swim either.

01:14.840 --> 01:16.840
I did nothing but eat.

01:16.840 --> 01:17.840
So how was Alabama?

01:17.840 --> 01:18.840
I did nothing but eat.

01:18.840 --> 01:22.840
You did in Alabama, too? Good times.

01:22.840 --> 01:35.840
I went to Alabama with sauce, and we stayed at my grandma's house and ate a lot of Blue Bell ice cream and watched a bunch of movies and had a Cracker Barrel in Waffle House.

01:35.840 --> 01:37.840
Sounds very, very Jamie.

01:37.840 --> 01:38.840
It was very delicious.

01:38.840 --> 01:39.840
It was a very Jamie experience.

01:39.840 --> 01:40.840
I had a delicious time.

01:40.840 --> 01:41.840
Excellent.

01:41.840 --> 01:43.840
All right, say hello as well to Tech Master, Loki.

01:43.840 --> 01:44.840
Hello.

01:44.840 --> 01:45.840
How are you doing, Loki?

01:45.840 --> 01:46.840
Fine.

01:46.840 --> 01:49.840
How are you enjoying the new studio, by the way, that we're taping in tonight?

01:49.840 --> 01:50.840
It's big.

01:50.840 --> 01:51.840
Yes, it's much more spacious than before.

01:51.840 --> 01:56.840
It even comes complete with a washer and dryer that you can't see on the camera.

01:56.840 --> 01:57.840
Yes.

01:57.840 --> 02:02.840
For when I piss myself with joy, I can clean my clothes right there.

02:02.840 --> 02:03.840
That's awesome.

02:03.840 --> 02:10.840
Or, you know, when we have the, as somebody said earlier, on the cam, we covered a ladder with one of the blankets there to make it look a little better.

02:10.840 --> 02:15.840
And somebody said something about we could use the ladder in having ladder matches during the show.

02:15.840 --> 02:22.840
And I was saying, oh, we have, you know, cage matches and bra and panties matches and, you know, whipped cream and bananas.

02:22.840 --> 02:23.840
Anyway.

02:23.840 --> 02:24.840
Yeah.

02:24.840 --> 02:27.840
Anyway, say hello as well to the one and only Puppy is here tonight joining us.

02:27.840 --> 02:28.840
Hello.

02:28.840 --> 02:29.840
How are you doing, Puppy?

02:29.840 --> 02:38.840
I'm worn out from school and work, but I'm getting by and I'm playing lots of rock band and my right leg is cramping.

02:38.840 --> 02:39.840
Well, now hold on.

02:39.840 --> 02:41.840
Don't spoil your gaming weeks just yet.

02:41.840 --> 02:42.840
Whoops.

02:42.840 --> 02:46.840
Maybe it's that you're angsty that your right leg is cramping so much.

02:46.840 --> 02:48.840
All sorts of errors tonight in the brand new studio.

02:48.840 --> 02:49.840
Do you like our new digs?

02:49.840 --> 02:51.840
It's much more spacious than that previous box.

02:51.840 --> 02:53.840
It is much more spacious than the previous box.

02:53.840 --> 02:56.840
Although, Loki still has the same table that wobbles.

02:56.840 --> 02:58.840
I think as somebody said...

02:58.840 --> 03:01.840
I used to have the overturned laundry basket.

03:01.840 --> 03:03.840
Now I have the wobbly table.

03:03.840 --> 03:04.840
I'm moving up in line.

03:04.840 --> 03:06.840
Independent radio at its finest.

03:06.840 --> 03:09.840
Somebody was saying earlier when I was doing the tests earlier today and somebody was watching,

03:09.840 --> 03:13.840
they said all I need is a little mini bar back there and we would truly be an orange lounge.

03:13.840 --> 03:14.840
It would be fun.

03:14.840 --> 03:15.840
We'll see.

03:15.840 --> 03:16.840
A mini bar would be nice.

03:16.840 --> 03:17.840
I'll bring some vodka.

03:17.840 --> 03:18.840
How about something that's orange?

03:18.840 --> 03:19.840
That also might help, too.

03:19.840 --> 03:21.840
Since there's absolutely no orange in there.

03:21.840 --> 03:23.840
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

03:23.840 --> 03:26.840
Penguin nose and chocobo nose.

03:26.840 --> 03:30.840
But you can't really see those because the camera's being blocked by the job.

03:30.840 --> 03:31.840
Yeah, a little ways away.

03:31.840 --> 03:35.840
Anyway, let's get into enough talking about our new digs.

03:35.840 --> 03:37.840
Let's talk about our gaming weeks.

03:37.840 --> 03:39.840
First, Sakura, why don't you start us off?

03:39.840 --> 03:40.840
How was your gaming week?

03:40.840 --> 03:42.840
Well, I played a lot of Ragnarok.

03:42.840 --> 03:46.840
Now that I have internet again, I missed it.

03:46.840 --> 03:49.840
I have a character at level 97 now.

03:49.840 --> 03:51.840
That was really awesome.

03:51.840 --> 03:57.840
While I was in Alabama, I didn't play crap except on the airplane where I tried to play some Oendan

03:57.840 --> 03:59.840
and totally irritated this guy sitting next to me.

03:59.840 --> 04:01.840
It was fantastic.

04:01.840 --> 04:03.840
That's great.

04:03.840 --> 04:07.840
I did that when I still had it when I was in classes in between breaks.

04:07.840 --> 04:11.840
People would be looking at me like, what the hell is that tapping noise you're doing?

04:11.840 --> 04:14.840
I had my headphones on, and he was just looking at me like a...

04:14.840 --> 04:18.840
Oh, but on the way back, this is cool.

04:18.840 --> 04:21.840
When I got on the little dinky tiny plane...

04:21.840 --> 04:22.840
No, I take that back.

04:22.840 --> 04:25.840
It was when I got on the bigger plane coming out of Dallas.

04:25.840 --> 04:28.840
These guys were sitting behind me like, oh, well, don't mind us.

04:28.840 --> 04:31.840
We're nerds, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

04:31.840 --> 04:33.840
I was like, okay.

04:33.840 --> 04:40.840
Then for some reason, we started talking about Half-Life, which I can't play Half-Life.

04:40.840 --> 04:44.840
I was like, yeah, I'm going to get Portal anyway, but I'm going to be so motion sick.

04:44.840 --> 04:46.840
They're like, you get motion sick, and you're on an airplane.

04:46.840 --> 04:49.840
I was like, only video games make me motion sick.

04:49.840 --> 04:50.840
I'm sure that guards them.

04:50.840 --> 04:53.840
That and riding in the backseat of a car will do it sometimes.

04:53.840 --> 04:56.840
Or riding in Kristen's car on Highway 1.

04:56.840 --> 04:58.840
Yeah, that was my gaming week.

04:58.840 --> 04:59.840
All right.

04:59.840 --> 05:01.840
We have a Black Knight pinball in our house now.

05:01.840 --> 05:04.840
Not a Black Knight 2000.

05:04.840 --> 05:07.840
We are housing somebody's Black Knight.

05:07.840 --> 05:08.840
What does that mean?

05:08.840 --> 05:09.840
You're borrowing?

05:09.840 --> 05:15.840
We're providing them storage space in exchange for massive amounts of playing it.

05:15.840 --> 05:16.840
All righty.

05:16.840 --> 05:18.840
Well, let's go over to the one and only Loki.

05:18.840 --> 05:21.840
How was your gaming week, Loki?

05:21.840 --> 05:24.840
Not as filled as I thought it would be, unfortunately.

05:24.840 --> 05:27.840
I planned to play a lot of things and never got around to it.

05:27.840 --> 05:31.840
But I played more Zelda fandom Hourglass.

05:31.840 --> 05:33.840
Almost done with that.

05:33.840 --> 05:37.840
See, the thing with Zelda games is when you finish them, you don't want to play them again.

05:37.840 --> 05:39.840
You're just like, you're done.

05:39.840 --> 05:40.840
Anyways...

05:40.840 --> 05:41.840
I don't know about that.

05:41.840 --> 05:45.840
I challenge that statement because I can still go back and play the old Super Nintendo one.

05:45.840 --> 05:47.840
And the old school NES ones I still love too.

05:47.840 --> 05:48.840
Yeah, true.

05:48.840 --> 05:49.840
Like the Super Nintendo ones and stuff.

05:49.840 --> 05:51.840
I think this game is a little bit shorter.

05:51.840 --> 05:55.840
I mean, it seemed to be really short versus, you know...

05:55.840 --> 05:57.840
Maybe you're just that good.

05:57.840 --> 05:59.840
No, the game is really fucking easy.

05:59.840 --> 06:02.840
It's like stupid easy.

06:02.840 --> 06:03.840
But, I don't know.

06:03.840 --> 06:04.840
It's just...

06:04.840 --> 06:07.840
It's okay, I guess.

06:07.840 --> 06:10.840
Saints Row actually went back and started playing the single player stuff.

06:10.840 --> 06:12.840
Not really...

06:12.840 --> 06:15.840
Now, I haven't really been playing the single player stuff.

06:15.840 --> 06:20.840
I've been playing single player but I've been blowing up this armored car over and over and over again.

06:20.840 --> 06:25.840
Because there's a trick where you can keep getting more money because I'm trying to get the achievement for a million dollars.

06:25.840 --> 06:27.840
And so I keep doing that.

06:27.840 --> 06:30.840
But it's entertaining nonetheless because you're blowing up cars over and over.

06:30.840 --> 06:32.840
Achievement whore.

06:32.840 --> 06:36.840
But, we've been switching it up at work instead of all rocket matches now.

06:36.840 --> 06:42.840
Now we're doing shotguns, pimp slap, and grenades in the meter maid cars.

06:42.840 --> 06:43.840
It's hilarious because...

06:43.840 --> 06:44.840
Boy, that sounds like a party.

06:44.840 --> 06:47.840
Pimp slaps and grenades in the meter maid cars.

06:47.840 --> 06:48.840
But you don't understand.

06:48.840 --> 06:49.840
That's like a band name.

06:49.840 --> 06:51.840
In Saints Row, the pimp slap is like a one hit kill.

06:51.840 --> 06:54.840
You just smack somebody and it launches them across the entire arena.

06:54.840 --> 06:56.840
It's actually pretty fun.

06:56.840 --> 06:58.840
But now we're switching it up.

06:58.840 --> 07:03.840
We're moving out of the arena into this parking garage because there's a thousand more meter maid cars everywhere.

07:03.840 --> 07:05.840
It's hilarious.

07:05.840 --> 07:09.840
And then, let's see, what else have I been playing?

07:09.840 --> 07:11.840
I played the Golden Compass on the Wii.

07:11.840 --> 07:14.840
That sucked.

07:14.840 --> 07:18.840
360, I played Dance Dance Revolution Universe 2.

07:18.840 --> 07:22.840
It's fucking DDR.

07:22.840 --> 07:27.840
It's exactly the same as Universe 1 to me.

07:27.840 --> 07:30.840
They've changed a few things.

07:30.840 --> 07:35.840
The quest mode, you're no longer moving around the United States and the world and stuff.

07:35.840 --> 07:39.840
It's now this fictional DDR island shit.

07:39.840 --> 07:41.840
I don't know.

07:41.840 --> 07:44.840
But is it broken still like the first quest mode was?

07:44.840 --> 07:46.840
Or did they actually kind of fix that?

07:46.840 --> 07:52.840
I would say it's 80% broken still instead of 100% broken as before.

07:52.840 --> 07:55.840
The song list is okay.

07:55.840 --> 07:59.840
I still hate the fact that I have to play through quest mode in order to unlock songs.

07:59.840 --> 08:03.840
I find that very annoying.

08:03.840 --> 08:06.840
But, I mean, it's okay. It's DDR.

08:06.840 --> 08:08.840
Luckily, I didn't have to buy it.

08:08.840 --> 08:12.840
That's good because right now the only way they're selling it is with the dance pad.

08:12.840 --> 08:15.840
You have to pay lots of money for that.

08:15.840 --> 08:19.840
If you're interested in picking it up, it is coming out in January.

08:19.840 --> 08:21.840
Game by itself.

08:21.840 --> 08:26.840
And about the same time we'll be getting a DDR Disney Channel edition.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.840
Which is probably going to be crap.

08:28.840 --> 08:30.840
But that's okay.

08:30.840 --> 08:33.840
But high school musical songs to DDR2.

08:33.840 --> 08:36.840
Okay. Yeah. Lame.

08:36.840 --> 08:40.840
Let's see. What else did I play this week?

08:40.840 --> 08:43.840
You know, I think that's about it.

08:43.840 --> 08:45.840
Because, really, I haven't had a chance to play a lot of stuff.

08:45.840 --> 08:50.840
In fact, I bought two games yesterday and I haven't even unwrapped them yet.

08:50.840 --> 08:56.840
I've got Contra IV and Final Fantasy XII Revenant Wings for when I finish Zelda.

08:56.840 --> 08:58.840
Which will be very soon.

08:58.840 --> 09:00.840
I don't know. All the extra stuff in Zelda.

09:00.840 --> 09:02.840
All the hidden islands and stuff.

09:02.840 --> 09:04.840
They have an island that looks like a DS.

09:04.840 --> 09:06.840
And I was like, oh, that's kind of funny.

09:06.840 --> 09:08.840
And that was about the extent of my interest in that.

09:08.840 --> 09:12.840
And then there's another island that you can find treasure.

09:12.840 --> 09:14.840
Which is really kind of lame.

09:14.840 --> 09:19.840
It's not like Wind Waker was where it kind of felt like Mega Man Legends to me a little bit.

09:19.840 --> 09:24.840
Where there's a lot of exploring of, you know, a ton of different dungeons and stuff.

09:24.840 --> 09:29.840
This game, I don't know, it's just kind of really scaled down and made the hell lot easier.

09:29.840 --> 09:32.840
So, I have to go back and play Wind Waker again.

09:32.840 --> 09:34.840
Because I never did finish that game.

09:34.840 --> 09:37.840
And then maybe eventually I'll warm up to playing Twilight Princess.

09:37.840 --> 09:41.840
But, I don't know. I just don't like it.

09:41.840 --> 09:42.840
Alright, fine.

09:42.840 --> 09:44.840
Alright, then my gaming week.

09:44.840 --> 09:46.840
There was some new stuff I finally got to play this week.

09:46.840 --> 09:48.840
As opposed to the same old MMOs.

09:48.840 --> 09:50.840
I actually didn't play the MMOs so much this week.

09:50.840 --> 09:52.840
I actually checked out some new stuff.

09:52.840 --> 09:54.840
Including the orange box, finally.

09:54.840 --> 09:56.840
Which is magnificent.

09:56.840 --> 09:58.840
There's several different games in there.

09:58.840 --> 10:00.840
I haven't even gotten to touch Team Fortress 2 yet.

10:00.840 --> 10:02.840
But I've been playing some of the other games in there.

10:02.840 --> 10:04.840
Half Life, which to be honest,

10:04.840 --> 10:07.840
I know it's a critically acclaimed game and everything.

10:07.840 --> 10:09.840
But I just never really got the chance to play it before.

10:09.840 --> 10:12.840
So this is really the first chance I'm getting to play Half Life.

10:12.840 --> 10:14.840
Half Life 2, I mean, of course.

10:14.840 --> 10:16.840
It's kind of cool. It's very immersive.

10:16.840 --> 10:18.840
And of course, Portal.

10:18.840 --> 10:20.840
I've been playing a lot of Portal.

10:20.840 --> 10:22.840
Moving through the game rather quickly,

10:22.840 --> 10:25.840
I guess the game really isn't that long, per se.

10:25.840 --> 10:28.840
But it'd be damned if it isn't pretty funny and pretty innovative.

10:28.840 --> 10:30.840
It's a great kind of...

10:30.840 --> 10:33.840
It's a puzzle game in first person.

10:33.840 --> 10:36.840
It's not a first person shooter. It's a first person puzzler.

10:36.840 --> 10:38.840
I don't know what else to call it. It's pretty cool.

10:38.840 --> 10:41.840
I swear to God though, that whole thing where you have to

10:41.840 --> 10:43.840
fire a portal on the ground,

10:43.840 --> 10:45.840
and then fire together half up on the ceiling,

10:45.840 --> 10:48.840
and then fall from the ceiling to the one on the ground to get enough inertia,

10:48.840 --> 10:50.840
that thing drove me frickin' nuts.

10:50.840 --> 10:53.840
I was trying to do that for like an hour.

10:53.840 --> 10:56.840
It was so difficult that I finally got through that.

10:56.840 --> 11:00.840
Let's see. Also, the other game I've been playing is

11:00.840 --> 11:03.840
Geometry Wars Galaxies I picked up on the Nintendo Wii.

11:03.840 --> 11:07.840
And I'm having quite a bit of fun with Geometry Wars Galaxies.

11:07.840 --> 11:09.840
It's a pretty good time.

11:09.840 --> 11:13.840
It's a lot different than just the game on the Xbox.

11:13.840 --> 11:17.840
On the good side, there's a lot of extra types of stages,

11:17.840 --> 11:19.840
more monsters, and you know what?

11:19.840 --> 11:22.840
The controls are actually not as hokey as you'd think.

11:22.840 --> 11:26.840
Like, you know, you have to use one half is the moving around.

11:26.840 --> 11:30.840
You move around with the nunchuck on one,

11:30.840 --> 11:34.840
and then you use the Wiimote to kind of point on the screen where you want to shoot.

11:34.840 --> 11:36.840
And you'd think that would be really hokey,

11:36.840 --> 11:38.840
but it actually works out really well.

11:38.840 --> 11:42.840
So, I actually kind of enjoyed the control scheme.

11:42.840 --> 11:46.840
And plus, if for whatever reason you don't like that control scheme,

11:46.840 --> 11:48.840
you can do the classic controller, which is great.

11:48.840 --> 11:52.840
Classic controller doesn't feel quite as nice as the Xbox 360 controller did,

11:52.840 --> 11:56.840
and I think it's because the directionals are a little more grooved on the Wii,

11:56.840 --> 12:01.840
whereas the Xbox 360 has the full 360 degrees of movement a little bit.

12:01.840 --> 12:05.840
So I think that it doesn't have quite the same feel with the classic controller, but it's nice.

12:05.840 --> 12:09.840
My only minor complaints about the game is that, A, it looks better on the 360, obviously.

12:09.840 --> 12:15.840
I mean, you can tell there's some graphical dumbing down that had to be done for the Wii,

12:15.840 --> 12:16.840
but it doesn't look bad.

12:16.840 --> 12:18.840
I mean, it is Geometry Wars.

12:18.840 --> 12:22.840
You're not going to expect, you know, the world's best-looking game,

12:22.840 --> 12:25.840
you know, when you're looking at that.

12:25.840 --> 12:29.840
And then also, the other only kind of minor complaint I have is that,

12:29.840 --> 12:33.840
you know, it's kind of cool that you progress through these different levels

12:33.840 --> 12:36.840
and you unlock new planets and you unlock new power-ups,

12:36.840 --> 12:38.840
because the other kind of thing that you have in Geometry Wars Galaxies,

12:38.840 --> 12:42.840
you have a little droid that follows you, and you can tell the droid what to do.

12:42.840 --> 12:46.840
Like, you can buy an attack mode or buy a defend,

12:46.840 --> 12:49.840
and as you play more levels, the droid levels up with you.

12:49.840 --> 12:52.840
And it's kind of cool, so it gets a little smarter.

12:52.840 --> 12:57.840
But the only thing is that there's really no method to that progression, if that makes sense.

12:57.840 --> 12:59.840
Like, there's no story to back it up.

12:59.840 --> 13:02.840
There's really no nothing.

13:02.840 --> 13:04.840
And, you know, I can kind of understand it,

13:04.840 --> 13:07.840
because Geometry Wars Galaxies is supposed to feel like an arcade game,

13:07.840 --> 13:10.840
especially like a classic 80s shooter, and it does that very well.

13:10.840 --> 13:14.840
But then I think, you know, even Pac-Man at least had the little cutscenes every three boards

13:14.840 --> 13:16.840
that kept it kind of, like, entertaining.

13:16.840 --> 13:21.840
There isn't really anything that you feel like you're working for, if that makes sense.

13:21.840 --> 13:24.840
So, that was my only minor complaint, but overall, I think the game's great.

13:24.840 --> 13:26.840
You don't think cutscenes in Geometry Wars?

13:26.840 --> 13:29.840
I don't mean, like, you have to, like, have these grand, like, cutscenes,

13:29.840 --> 13:32.840
but, like, give me a reason for kind of, like, unlocking all these things.

13:32.840 --> 13:35.840
Or, you know, just a little bit of a story wouldn't hurt.

13:35.840 --> 13:36.840
You know what I mean?

13:36.840 --> 13:43.840
What they need to do is take Geometry Wars out of, like, just the normal, like, asteroid kind of stuff,

13:43.840 --> 13:48.840
and make it into, like, a shoot-em-up game, like Gradius or something like that.

13:48.840 --> 13:49.840
That would be fun.

13:49.840 --> 13:50.840
Yeah, it might be fun.

13:50.840 --> 13:55.840
The other cool thing about Geometry Wars I thought was really cool is that you can download the demo of,

13:55.840 --> 13:59.840
well, it's not really the demo of galaxies to your DS.

13:59.840 --> 14:00.840
It's just basically retro-evolved.

14:00.840 --> 14:04.840
You can download to your DS from the Wii, which is kind of cool,

14:04.840 --> 14:07.840
but I do not like the way the DS controls it all.

14:07.840 --> 14:12.840
So, I don't really want the game on DS, because you use the stylus on the bottom to control your firing,

14:12.840 --> 14:15.840
and it just, it's not that that really bothers me.

14:15.840 --> 14:17.840
It's the trying to move around with the directional pad.

14:17.840 --> 14:20.840
You know, a DS only has the up, down, left, right, really.

14:20.840 --> 14:25.840
The 360 degrees of movement, which is so important in Geometry Wars, is kind of lost on the DS.

14:25.840 --> 14:26.840
But overall, I liked galaxies.

14:26.840 --> 14:31.840
It was fun, and I think it's a good game to kind of play, like, in short little segments,

14:31.840 --> 14:33.840
just like an old, you know, 80s arcade shooter.

14:33.840 --> 14:36.840
So, Puppey, anything you want to share about your gaming week?

14:36.840 --> 14:37.840
A couple of things.

14:37.840 --> 14:42.840
I've been whoring out Rock Band a ton ever since I got it.

14:42.840 --> 14:50.840
I had to switch back to my Guitar Hero 3 controller, because the strum bar on my Rock Band controller died,

14:50.840 --> 14:54.840
and I sent out for the warranty on that, and it actually came back already.

14:54.840 --> 14:58.840
It only took three days for me to get the replacement, and I sent the other one back.

14:58.840 --> 15:04.840
And then, other than that, I got Gamefly, so I've been renting games lately.

15:04.840 --> 15:10.840
I wanted to rent Mass Effect, Call of Duty 4, Orange Box,

15:10.840 --> 15:16.840
and for, I guess I had put Dead Rising on my list a long time ago and forgot about it,

15:16.840 --> 15:18.840
and they ended up sending me that instead.

15:18.840 --> 15:23.840
I played it for a total of an hour and a half, and sent it back.

15:23.840 --> 15:26.840
I could not stand that game for some reason.

15:26.840 --> 15:28.840
It was just terrible.

15:28.840 --> 15:33.840
I thought it was great, because you could, you know, hit zombies with a scythe or a lawnmower.

15:33.840 --> 15:38.840
Well, that was entertaining, but the story could have been cooler,

15:38.840 --> 15:41.840
but the way they've got the game set up, you can only save it once,

15:41.840 --> 15:46.840
and if you die, you have to go back very far and reload a bunch of crap.

15:46.840 --> 15:54.840
I just got sick of it very quickly, and I would not have played through the entire game.

15:54.840 --> 15:57.840
Is that it?

15:57.840 --> 16:03.840
Rock Band, Dead Rising, not playing Halo again until the maps come out next week.

16:03.840 --> 16:05.840
Yeah, that's pretty much it.

16:05.840 --> 16:10.840
Going to the chat room, our always-present other guests, chat.orangelawnsradio.com,

16:10.840 --> 16:14.840
they're kind of lit up right now, because our live 365 stream has been going up and down,

16:14.840 --> 16:17.840
which has been kind of one unfortunate side effect of the new studio,

16:17.840 --> 16:21.840
is that the wireless router now is kind of on the other corner of the house,

16:21.840 --> 16:22.840
so I think I've been losing signal a little bit.

16:22.840 --> 16:24.840
I don't know if Op11 is interfering with that.

16:24.840 --> 16:28.840
So what I'll probably have to do next week is we'll probably get a little sub-router,

16:28.840 --> 16:31.840
because we have a giant cord that we run out here for Operator 11.

16:31.840 --> 16:33.840
I'll also have to get something to split that signal.

16:33.840 --> 16:36.840
But yet, Jamie and Loki's computers run fine on the wireless network.

16:36.840 --> 16:39.840
I don't know what that is, but then again, they're not trying to broadcast a radio program from that.

16:39.840 --> 16:42.840
So I apologize, chat room, if live 365 is going up and down,

16:42.840 --> 16:45.840
we'll just kind of have to deal with it tonight, and then next week we'll fix that.

16:45.840 --> 16:50.840
But now we know, which is weird, because I ran live 365 and Op11 at the same time

16:50.840 --> 16:53.840
for 40 minutes earlier today, and everything was fine,

16:53.840 --> 16:55.840
but now, of course, we're having a plethora of problems.

16:55.840 --> 16:56.840
Just my luck.

16:56.840 --> 16:59.840
And people will continuously bitch about it.

16:59.840 --> 17:01.840
Actually, I'm not really sure why.

17:01.840 --> 17:04.840
Well, I think it might just be because of the way your wireless is set up

17:04.840 --> 17:07.840
versus having a wireless card built in.

17:07.840 --> 17:10.840
Possibly. I don't know. Because I have the little USB thing?

17:10.840 --> 17:12.840
Possibly. Who knows.

17:12.840 --> 17:14.840
Well, we'll see what happens. We'll do our best.

17:14.840 --> 17:16.840
Anyway, we've got to keep the show moving,

17:16.840 --> 17:19.840
because of course we've got lots of people who listen to this in the podcast form,

17:19.840 --> 17:23.840
and they don't understand any of this that they're hearing right now.

17:23.840 --> 17:26.840
They're like, what are you talking about, this wireless router and stuff?

17:26.840 --> 17:29.840
Live 365 and chat room, what is all that about?

17:29.840 --> 17:34.840
Anyhow, I was going to talk about one more thing that I played this week.

17:34.840 --> 17:36.840
Well, alrighty.

17:36.840 --> 17:40.840
And I'm not sure, I can't remember if we're getting into this later on or not,

17:40.840 --> 17:47.840
but anyways, there's an independent games festival thing

17:47.840 --> 17:51.840
kind of going on right now that they've got some of the finalists for.

17:51.840 --> 17:53.840
I think the awards come up later in our show.

17:53.840 --> 17:56.840
Yeah, the awards. The 10th Annual Independent Games Festival.

17:56.840 --> 18:00.840
Anyways, I was playing some of the finalists for that,

18:00.840 --> 18:03.840
and one of the games I played, Clean Asia,

18:03.840 --> 18:06.840
which I'm a huge fan of Warning Forever and stuff like that.

18:06.840 --> 18:08.840
Very similar style game.

18:08.840 --> 18:10.840
Very cool shoot-em-up, you've got to try that.

18:10.840 --> 18:13.840
Also, Cran Physics is another funny one.

18:13.840 --> 18:15.840
But they've got some other stuff in there as well,

18:15.840 --> 18:18.840
including a game that I talked about before.

18:18.840 --> 18:21.840
What was it? Let's see here.

18:21.840 --> 18:23.840
Fret Nice was another one of the nominees,

18:23.840 --> 18:28.840
which is a pretty fun game to play on the PC with the Guitar Hero controller.

18:28.840 --> 18:31.840
Well, tell us more about that when we get to that part of the show.

18:31.840 --> 18:32.840
Will do.

18:32.840 --> 18:34.840
Rob, I have a question about your gaming week.

18:34.840 --> 18:35.840
Sure.

18:35.840 --> 18:37.840
Did you make it past that part in Portal?

18:37.840 --> 18:40.840
I sure did. I got to the next level in Portal.

18:40.840 --> 18:45.840
I was venting with Jamie my frustration at the robots that shoot you a bunch and then you die.

18:45.840 --> 18:47.840
I was having a hard time getting through that portion,

18:47.840 --> 18:49.840
and then Jamie said, you have to shoot the ceiling.

18:49.840 --> 18:51.840
And she showed me this little walkthrough she'd been watching on the internet.

18:51.840 --> 18:55.840
I'm like, God damn it, I didn't even think to shoot the damn ceiling and drop bricks on them.

18:55.840 --> 18:58.840
I was trying to shoot the floor and shoot them out through the floor,

18:58.840 --> 19:03.840
but there's one part where you can't because the floor is the type where you can't build portals.

19:03.840 --> 19:06.840
And I was just taking the cube and trying to bowl them over.

19:06.840 --> 19:08.840
That's how I was doing it.

19:08.840 --> 19:10.840
And it worked for a minute.

19:10.840 --> 19:12.840
You can use the camera too.

19:12.840 --> 19:14.840
People are using the cameras.

19:14.840 --> 19:17.840
But I felt bad for Rob.

19:17.840 --> 19:21.840
I watched the walkthrough a bajillion times just because I thought it was funny.

19:21.840 --> 19:24.840
And so I had to help.

19:24.840 --> 19:25.840
That's right.

19:25.840 --> 19:27.840
So now I'm to the next stage in Portal.

19:27.840 --> 19:30.840
I just kind of quit for the night because I wanted to play some other stuff,

19:30.840 --> 19:32.840
so I had new things to talk about tonight.

19:32.840 --> 19:34.840
Anyhow, a little bit of housekeeping.

19:34.840 --> 19:37.840
I guess I already talked about the parts about the new studio,

19:37.840 --> 19:41.840
and unfortunately the effect it's having on us tonight with the whole live stream cutting in and out.

19:41.840 --> 19:43.840
Sorry about that.

19:43.840 --> 19:47.840
But we'll hopefully fix that within the next couple weeks.

19:47.840 --> 19:49.840
Are we doing a show December 23rd?

19:49.840 --> 19:51.840
I don't think we talked about that.

19:51.840 --> 19:53.840
It's the Christmas week.

19:53.840 --> 19:55.840
Here it is for Christmas.

19:55.840 --> 19:57.840
I should be available.

19:57.840 --> 19:58.840
Yeah, I think I'll probably be here too.

19:58.840 --> 20:00.840
But I have to work Monday.

20:00.840 --> 20:02.840
And of course we have our year-end show coming.

20:02.840 --> 20:03.840
You have to work on Christmas Eve?

20:03.840 --> 20:04.840
Yeah.

20:04.840 --> 20:05.840
Sorry about that.

20:05.840 --> 20:09.840
I work for, you know, freakin' tyrants, so it's okay.

20:09.840 --> 20:14.840
We'll be having our year-end special probably on December 30th,

20:14.840 --> 20:19.840
and I'm hoping that we get some guests on the program like we did last year,

20:19.840 --> 20:20.840
but more on that in the next couple weeks.

20:20.840 --> 20:22.840
Let's get to the gaming news.

20:22.840 --> 20:23.840
Enough about the housekeeping stuff.

20:23.840 --> 20:25.840
Let's start off Loki tonight.

20:25.840 --> 20:27.840
Anyways, I just wanted to comment one thing on the chat room.

20:27.840 --> 20:30.840
Everyone's talking about the weighted companion cube and stuff.

20:30.840 --> 20:33.840
No one ever mentions the weighted companion sphere

20:33.840 --> 20:35.840
that happens to be in the challenge mode of the game.

20:35.840 --> 20:37.840
No love for the sphere, I guess.

20:37.840 --> 20:39.840
What's the difference between the sphere and the cube?

20:39.840 --> 20:41.840
One's round and one's cube.

20:41.840 --> 20:45.840
Does the computer call it the weighted companion sphere?

20:45.840 --> 20:46.840
I don't know.

20:46.840 --> 20:50.840
Well, I think all that stuff's still the same,

20:50.840 --> 20:54.840
but it's just it's harder because you can't just drop it and it will roll.

20:54.840 --> 20:55.840
Oh, that's right.

20:55.840 --> 20:57.840
And you can't jump on top of it as easy because it'll roll.

20:57.840 --> 20:58.840
Okay, I get it.

20:58.840 --> 21:01.840
I'm like, duh, I know one's a sphere and a cube, dumbass.

21:01.840 --> 21:03.840
I'm like, what is the effect that that has?

21:03.840 --> 21:04.840
Okay, I get it.

21:04.840 --> 21:07.840
I know the sphere does not have any hearts on it.

21:07.840 --> 21:09.840
Aw, sadness.

21:09.840 --> 21:10.840
So it doesn't really like you.

21:10.840 --> 21:12.840
It's just pretending.

21:12.840 --> 21:14.840
Well, then why throw that thing in the incinerator like that?

21:14.840 --> 21:15.840
It's like challenge mode, okay.

21:15.840 --> 21:20.840
Anyways, this week Rockstar happened to throw out on the internet

21:20.840 --> 21:22.840
a brand new trailer for Grand Theft Auto IV.

21:22.840 --> 21:24.840
It's fucking fantastic.

21:24.840 --> 21:25.840
It's called Move Up, Ladies.

21:25.840 --> 21:29.840
It's basically what's really important about this trailer, though,

21:29.840 --> 21:32.840
compared to the last one, which came out about six months ago,

21:32.840 --> 21:36.840
is it looks a lot better than, you know, the game has really progressed.

21:36.840 --> 21:40.840
But it did show kind of a lot of the detail that they're adding in there,

21:40.840 --> 21:44.840
including, you know, gunfights and all the stuff that you'd expect

21:44.840 --> 21:45.840
from Grand Theft Auto.

21:45.840 --> 21:47.840
But there's a bunch of new screenshots and stuff.

21:47.840 --> 21:50.840
I have to say the game is coming along very well.

21:50.840 --> 21:51.840
It looks awesome.

21:51.840 --> 21:54.840
And I think a lot of people that were kind of hesitating about the game

21:54.840 --> 21:56.840
before saying, oh, this is just going to be crap,

21:56.840 --> 21:58.840
were really on board with it.

21:58.840 --> 22:01.840
But if you want to check it out, it's pretty much everywhere.

22:01.840 --> 22:04.840
All the major sites, Xbox Live, PlayStation Network,

22:04.840 --> 22:08.840
you can definitely find it and download.

22:08.840 --> 22:09.840
All righty.

22:09.840 --> 22:13.840
So does it actually show, like, more than just the cut scenes?

22:13.840 --> 22:15.840
Like, do you actually see what the game is?

22:15.840 --> 22:18.840
I still, all the cut scenes are with the in-game engine.

22:18.840 --> 22:22.840
So, I mean, you essentially see what the game looks like.

22:22.840 --> 22:26.840
One of the characters that they showed also was, again,

22:26.840 --> 22:28.840
going to be voiced, I guess, by Seth Green.

22:28.840 --> 22:30.840
So that was kind of funny.

22:30.840 --> 22:32.840
But it looks really cool.

22:32.840 --> 22:34.840
I like the trailers.

22:34.840 --> 22:36.840
I just can't wait for the game to come out.

22:36.840 --> 22:39.840
I hope it comes out actually in April, like it's supposed to.

22:39.840 --> 22:40.840
All right.

22:40.840 --> 22:43.840
Anyhow, let's move on to another story about Sony.

22:43.840 --> 22:46.840
And, of course, the Sony iBo.

22:46.840 --> 22:49.840
You've got to love the iBo, the little doggy.

22:49.840 --> 22:50.840
I thought they discontinued the iBo.

22:50.840 --> 22:53.840
You know, I guess they did discontinue the iBo that's out now,

22:53.840 --> 22:56.840
but it's because there's another iBo on the way, apparently,

22:56.840 --> 22:59.840
at least if Stuff Magazine is to be believed.

22:59.840 --> 23:03.840
They're currently running a rumor that there is the new iBo

23:03.840 --> 23:08.840
that's going to interface with the PSP and the PlayStation 3.

23:08.840 --> 23:10.840
I guess the reason why they're doing this

23:10.840 --> 23:15.840
is to kind of give the PlayStation 3 more toys and cool stuff,

23:15.840 --> 23:18.840
so that it's not just the eye of judgment that they have,

23:18.840 --> 23:20.840
but that they have the iBo as well.

23:20.840 --> 23:24.840
So apparently the iBo is going to have its own avatar.

23:24.840 --> 23:27.840
You'll actually see it within Home, Sony Home.

23:27.840 --> 23:31.840
It'll actually do things in the real world like it does in Sony's Home,

23:31.840 --> 23:33.840
which should be kind of interesting.

23:33.840 --> 23:36.840
So apparently you're going to be able to download new personalities

23:36.840 --> 23:38.840
for the iBo from PlayStation Network,

23:38.840 --> 23:42.840
and you're going to be able to use the PSP with it over Wi-Fi.

23:42.840 --> 23:47.840
The little camera in the dog's head will actually also show on your PSP screen.

23:47.840 --> 23:51.840
So what you could actually do is you could move your dog around

23:51.840 --> 23:55.840
and put it right under ladies' skirts and then use the PSP as an upskirt cam.

23:55.840 --> 23:59.840
So when girls go, oh, what a cute, fake doggy.

23:59.840 --> 24:02.840
That's probably the reasoning why they put it in Stuff Magazine to begin with.

24:02.840 --> 24:04.840
Possibly.

24:04.840 --> 24:07.840
I wanted to get one so I could play with my cat,

24:07.840 --> 24:10.840
because my cat's kind of getting lonely and she's causing a lot of trouble,

24:10.840 --> 24:13.840
and I figured this would be a perfect way to spend a couple thousand dollars

24:13.840 --> 24:16.840
is to get a thing to play with my cat.

24:16.840 --> 24:19.840
Then I could also watch it at work and watch what my cat's doing.

24:19.840 --> 24:21.840
Now here's my favorite part,

24:21.840 --> 24:27.840
Stuff Magazine rates this rumor at a 53% possibility.

24:27.840 --> 24:30.840
Where the fuck do you get a number like that?

24:30.840 --> 24:33.840
It makes it sound like there's this real scientific process

24:33.840 --> 24:38.840
that rumors go through over at Stuff Magazine in order to get a rating.

24:38.840 --> 24:42.840
So it's like they put it in their big super-predicting computer.

24:42.840 --> 24:44.840
Here's a little note.

24:44.840 --> 24:47.840
This has a 53% probability of being true.

24:47.840 --> 24:53.840
It's about as official as the if they mated segment of Conan, okay?

24:53.840 --> 24:56.840
We'll see. I don't know. I kind of call BS.

24:56.840 --> 24:59.840
I think there may be a little something with the eyebo,

24:59.840 --> 25:02.840
but I don't know, upskirt cams, I don't know about that.

25:02.840 --> 25:04.840
We don't need to be giving Sony any ideas.

25:04.840 --> 25:06.840
I want an eyebo, Rob.

25:06.840 --> 25:09.840
Okay, well, save up your money and then you can buy one.

25:09.840 --> 25:11.840
I've wanted an eyebo for a very long time.

25:11.840 --> 25:13.840
I have a live journal icon that's an eyebo.

25:13.840 --> 25:14.840
I want a pony.

25:14.840 --> 25:15.840
You know what?

25:15.840 --> 25:17.840
I'm not exactly to get a pony.

25:17.840 --> 25:20.840
Eyebo of judgment.

25:20.840 --> 25:22.840
The eyebo of judgment.

25:22.840 --> 25:23.840
They should make the eye pony.

25:23.840 --> 25:25.840
I was watching a special on robotics last night

25:25.840 --> 25:27.840
and they were bringing up the eyebo.

25:27.840 --> 25:31.840
But it was these lifelike robot people,

25:31.840 --> 25:34.840
things that could interview people and repeat back your question

25:34.840 --> 25:36.840
and follow you and do all this stuff.

25:36.840 --> 25:39.840
I was like, yet the eyebo didn't sell better.

25:39.840 --> 25:42.840
Eye paparazzi?

25:42.840 --> 25:45.840
It was called like the respond queue or something, it was really weird.

25:45.840 --> 25:48.840
It was at one of the Tokyo robotics shows I was watching.

25:48.840 --> 25:53.840
Anyway, for anyone who is interested in Devil May Cry 4,

25:53.840 --> 25:58.840
which I know I am because I really, really, really, really, really, really like Devil May Cry,

25:58.840 --> 26:02.840
except why the hell are they giving Dante a beard?

26:02.840 --> 26:06.840
The demo is going to be out in early 2008, according to Capcom.

26:06.840 --> 26:10.840
For PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, there will be a PC version,

26:10.840 --> 26:12.840
but no word on if we're getting a demo of that.

26:12.840 --> 26:16.840
And the demo is supposed to be different levels in the game

26:16.840 --> 26:19.840
instead of just, oh, here's the start of the game, bye.

26:19.840 --> 26:23.840
It's to give you a sample of the environments and different characters.

26:23.840 --> 26:25.840
See, now I worry about you having an eyebo

26:25.840 --> 26:30.840
because the fangasm you have when you play this Devil May Cry demo

26:30.840 --> 26:33.840
will get all over your eyebo, and that's just filthy.

26:33.840 --> 26:36.840
No.

26:36.840 --> 26:37.840
No.

26:37.840 --> 26:39.840
Will you at least put a towel over your eyebo so he doesn't have to watch?

26:39.840 --> 26:43.840
I wouldn't get an eyebo anyway because you know my cat would be offended.

26:43.840 --> 26:45.840
Miss Stupid Shermy Butt.

26:45.840 --> 26:47.840
Shermy's been replaced with a robot?

26:47.840 --> 26:48.840
No.

26:48.840 --> 26:49.840
Okay.

26:49.840 --> 26:52.840
She gets offended when I bring new people into the house.

26:52.840 --> 26:53.840
She gets used to them.

26:53.840 --> 26:55.840
How exactly does a cat get offended?

26:55.840 --> 26:56.840
That's what I want to know.

26:56.840 --> 26:58.840
You know how some cats just get pissy and walk off and everything?

26:58.840 --> 27:02.840
Shermy just gives me this hurt look.

27:02.840 --> 27:03.840
I don't know how else to describe it.

27:03.840 --> 27:05.840
She doesn't get pissy.

27:05.840 --> 27:07.840
She doesn't, like, start hissing at anybody.

27:07.840 --> 27:09.840
She just looks hurt.

27:09.840 --> 27:10.840
That's why I'm a dog person.

27:10.840 --> 27:14.840
We've secretly replaced Shermy with an eyebo.

27:14.840 --> 27:20.840
My cat's so retarded, she still thinks that the mirror is another cat, so, you know.

27:20.840 --> 27:23.840
I was watching on YouTube last night, though, along with the robotic stuff,

27:23.840 --> 27:28.840
I was also watching cats talking to people, you know, that could imitate human talk,

27:28.840 --> 27:31.840
and Shermy was going crazy.

27:31.840 --> 27:33.840
She was running into the desk.

27:33.840 --> 27:38.840
She gets unnatural!

27:38.840 --> 27:41.840
What in God's name is going on over there?

27:41.840 --> 27:42.840
That's what it sounded like, actually.

27:42.840 --> 27:43.840
Wow.

27:43.840 --> 27:44.840
You don't understand.

27:44.840 --> 27:46.840
We're kind of crazy with our cat.

27:46.840 --> 27:50.840
We'll make her talk, like, and we'll have conversations with her,

27:50.840 --> 27:55.840
but she can't talk, and I don't know why the hell we do that.

27:55.840 --> 27:57.840
And she has a really high-pitched voice somehow.

27:57.840 --> 27:58.840
I don't know.

27:58.840 --> 27:59.840
It's weird.

27:59.840 --> 28:00.840
One of the videos I was watching last night,

28:00.840 --> 28:04.840
it just sounded like the cat was actually just, like, saying,

28:04.840 --> 28:06.840
Hello?

28:06.840 --> 28:07.840
Hello?

28:07.840 --> 28:08.840
Like that.

28:08.840 --> 28:09.840
And I was like, okay.

28:09.840 --> 28:13.840
And then another one was a cat sleeping in a sink.

28:13.840 --> 28:16.840
Is this where Lolcats is going in 2008?

28:16.840 --> 28:17.840
I don't know.

28:17.840 --> 28:18.840
I think so.

28:18.840 --> 28:19.840
Wow.

28:19.840 --> 28:20.840
Okay.

28:20.840 --> 28:21.840
Let's move on.

28:21.840 --> 28:24.840
Anyways.

28:24.840 --> 28:25.840
So, yes.

28:25.840 --> 28:30.840
One of the unfortunate things with the PlayStation 3 version of Rock Band

28:30.840 --> 28:33.840
was that you couldn't use your Guitar Hero 3 controller with it.

28:33.840 --> 28:35.840
Well, now that's going to be fixed,

28:35.840 --> 28:38.840
and there is going to be a patch that's going to be coming

28:38.840 --> 28:42.840
where you'll be able to download it, and it will allow it to play.

28:42.840 --> 28:43.840
Hooray!

28:43.840 --> 28:44.840
That's kind of funny, though,

28:44.840 --> 28:48.840
is they had another story that came out earlier this week.

28:48.840 --> 28:53.840
Some guy, Red Octane, was actually making fun of Rock Band

28:53.840 --> 28:56.840
and their guitar controllers and saying how they're never going to make

28:56.840 --> 28:58.840
those controllers compatible with Guitar Hero 3

28:58.840 --> 29:01.840
because they think their controllers are crap.

29:01.840 --> 29:04.840
Way to take the high road, Red Octane.

29:04.840 --> 29:08.840
You know, hey, it doesn't matter that our consumers or anything

29:08.840 --> 29:10.840
might want it a little bit easier so they don't have to buy more

29:10.840 --> 29:12.840
of your crappy controllers.

29:12.840 --> 29:15.840
Sure, let's just go ahead and piss on them.

29:15.840 --> 29:18.840
Hooray!

29:18.840 --> 29:22.840
I do like, though, that they're at least patching to, you know,

29:22.840 --> 29:24.840
like somebody's giving in a little bit and patching

29:24.840 --> 29:26.840
so the guitars work universally.

29:26.840 --> 29:27.840
Exactly, they should.

29:27.840 --> 29:29.840
I don't understand why they lock it out of other games.

29:29.840 --> 29:31.840
It's just fucking lazy.

29:31.840 --> 29:33.840
Actually, it's just fucking mean is what it is.

29:33.840 --> 29:36.840
Jonathan F. in our chat room has a good point that

29:36.840 --> 29:39.840
I don't believe we're covering elsewhere on our show tonight.

29:39.840 --> 29:40.840
He says, speaking of patches,

29:40.840 --> 29:43.840
Guitar Hero Wii discs will be replaced in 2008

29:43.840 --> 29:45.840
to fix the mono sound problem.

29:45.840 --> 29:46.840
Did you hear about that?

29:46.840 --> 29:47.840
Yeah.

29:47.840 --> 29:49.840
So they're going to remaster the discs or whatever,

29:49.840 --> 29:51.840
and they'll be available in 2008 new discs.

29:51.840 --> 29:53.840
But how many people do you think will actually do that?

29:53.840 --> 29:56.840
I bet most Wii owners probably wouldn't even think to do it.

29:56.840 --> 29:58.840
There might be a few.

29:58.840 --> 29:59.840
Well, we need to spread the word.

29:59.840 --> 30:02.840
Make it financially sucky for them.

30:02.840 --> 30:03.840
Well, there you have it.

30:03.840 --> 30:05.840
If you own Guitar Hero on the Wii,

30:05.840 --> 30:07.840
then be sure in 2008 you request your...

30:07.840 --> 30:10.840
And even if you don't care, just get a new one anyway,

30:10.840 --> 30:12.840
just because newer is better.

30:12.840 --> 30:13.840
That's what you need to remember.

30:13.840 --> 30:14.840
Newer is better.

30:14.840 --> 30:15.840
That's right.

30:15.840 --> 30:16.840
Newer is better.

30:16.840 --> 30:19.840
Moving on, we're talking about the PlayStation a little bit,

30:19.840 --> 30:22.840
and on the PlayStation Network, it has been released this week,

30:22.840 --> 30:25.840
a brand new bowling game.

30:25.840 --> 30:28.840
High velocity bowling is $10.

30:28.840 --> 30:31.840
Also added to the PlayStation Network,

30:31.840 --> 30:33.840
some new stuff for the game Folklore,

30:33.840 --> 30:36.840
and of course, Rock Band downloadable content.

30:36.840 --> 30:39.840
Also, Wild Arms is now available for download

30:39.840 --> 30:43.840
on the old school PlayStation Games line.

30:43.840 --> 30:44.840
Yay!

30:44.840 --> 30:46.840
So, I don't know.

30:46.840 --> 30:52.840
It's certainly not Wii bowling, but it kind of looks a little urban.

30:52.840 --> 30:54.840
You play a guy with tattoos.

30:54.840 --> 30:56.840
You actually use the 6-axis controller.

30:56.840 --> 30:58.840
Yeah, I was kind of curious about that.

30:58.840 --> 31:00.840
Yeah, we're going to have people throw...

31:00.840 --> 31:04.840
See though, I don't know if this one would be making holes in TVs and stuff,

31:04.840 --> 31:06.840
because it's kind of rounded and a little bit light,

31:06.840 --> 31:09.840
whereas when you kind of huck the remote,

31:09.840 --> 31:11.840
it's kind of like a javelin type thing.

31:11.840 --> 31:12.840
Just get the Nerf thing for it.

31:12.840 --> 31:13.840
That's what you do.

31:13.840 --> 31:15.840
Yeah, you just get the Nerf thing for it.

31:15.840 --> 31:22.840
Well, in other news for our PlayStation 3 owners,

31:22.840 --> 31:25.840
which at Best Buy, that was freaking sad.

31:25.840 --> 31:28.840
Oh yes, Jamie and I went to Best Buy earlier this week,

31:28.840 --> 31:30.840
and we were shopping.

31:30.840 --> 31:31.840
We were just kind of going around.

31:31.840 --> 31:32.840
Sad.

31:32.840 --> 31:34.840
That's when I bought Geometry Wars Galaxies.

31:34.840 --> 31:35.840
Yes.

31:35.840 --> 31:37.840
I was thinking about getting Trauma Center,

31:37.840 --> 31:39.840
and I ended up getting the cheaper of the game.

31:39.840 --> 31:41.840
And I bought Super Breakout for the Atari 5200 that night.

31:41.840 --> 31:42.840
But that was later.

31:42.840 --> 31:44.840
But I already own two copies of it.

31:44.840 --> 31:46.840
Then why did you buy a third, dummy?

31:46.840 --> 31:48.840
I thought that we didn't have it,

31:48.840 --> 31:50.840
and then it occurred to me when we got home

31:50.840 --> 31:52.840
that freaking Super Breakout was the game

31:52.840 --> 31:57.840
that came with the Atari 5200.

31:57.840 --> 31:58.840
But I have a manual now.

31:58.840 --> 31:59.840
That's good.

31:59.840 --> 32:00.840
All right.

32:00.840 --> 32:02.840
Well, anyhow, I was going to say at Best Buy,

32:02.840 --> 32:06.840
we were there, and there were big stacks of PlayStation 3s

32:06.840 --> 32:08.840
all over the store, not just one stack,

32:08.840 --> 32:11.840
but at least four stacks of PlayStation 3s.

32:11.840 --> 32:16.840
There were easily, what, 50 systems just sitting out unloved?

32:16.840 --> 32:18.840
And we were talking to the guy,

32:18.840 --> 32:20.840
because the guy was helping me look up Geometry Wars Galaxies,

32:20.840 --> 32:21.840
because for whatever reason,

32:21.840 --> 32:22.840
they didn't have any out on the floor.

32:22.840 --> 32:23.840
They were all in the cage.

32:23.840 --> 32:25.840
So I was asking him if they had it and everything.

32:25.840 --> 32:26.840
And you could tell he was kind of a gamer,

32:26.840 --> 32:27.840
so we were kind of joking with him,

32:27.840 --> 32:30.840
and he said something about he was playing Geometry Wars on a 360.

32:30.840 --> 32:32.840
And we said something about,

32:32.840 --> 32:34.840
it looks like you haven't been moving a whole lot of these.

32:34.840 --> 32:36.840
And we touched the PlayStation 3 thing,

32:36.840 --> 32:38.840
and he said, not really.

32:38.840 --> 32:40.840
He said, the first couple days, there were a lot,

32:40.840 --> 32:42.840
but not really.

32:42.840 --> 32:43.840
So.

32:43.840 --> 32:44.840
Yeah.

32:44.840 --> 32:45.840
It's not looking good, Sony fans.

32:45.840 --> 32:47.840
Sorry to say.

32:47.840 --> 32:50.840
Maybe more when Metal Gear Solid and Final Fantasy 13 comes out.

32:50.840 --> 32:51.840
We'll see.

32:51.840 --> 32:52.840
But anyway.

32:52.840 --> 32:54.840
Metal Gear Solid for Geriatric Snake.

32:54.840 --> 32:55.840
We'll see.

32:55.840 --> 32:56.840
Anyway.

32:56.840 --> 32:59.840
Nobody likes a Geriatric Snake.

32:59.840 --> 33:04.840
Or GZDr4ev says Unreal Tournament 3 will sell the PlayStation 3 units.

33:04.840 --> 33:05.840
No it won't.

33:05.840 --> 33:06.840
It will sell some.

33:06.840 --> 33:08.840
There's fanboys for everything.

33:08.840 --> 33:10.840
Well.

33:10.840 --> 33:13.840
You know, maybe when they put out Jumping Flash 3.

33:13.840 --> 33:15.840
But anyway.

33:15.840 --> 33:20.840
For the 2.0 PS3 firmware update,

33:20.840 --> 33:23.840
there is,

33:23.840 --> 33:29.840
it was actually included that there were custom soundtracks for High Velocity Bowling.

33:29.840 --> 33:33.840
Okay, who's playing High Velocity Bowling?

33:33.840 --> 33:35.840
Well, I don't know whoever downloaded it this week.

33:35.840 --> 33:36.840
Who knows?

33:36.840 --> 33:40.840
But it also has an in-game friends list for the demo for Timeshift.

33:40.840 --> 33:46.840
So it looks like that more games, hopefully, are going to be incorporating that type of thing.

33:46.840 --> 33:49.840
Like, who's online, that type of thing.

33:49.840 --> 33:52.840
So, unfortunately though, it's not going to be centralized.

33:52.840 --> 33:54.840
It'll be up to the game people to put it in their games.

33:54.840 --> 33:55.840
Yeah.

33:55.840 --> 33:58.840
I mean,

33:58.840 --> 34:00.840
they're not getting it.

34:00.840 --> 34:03.840
I don't think they,

34:03.840 --> 34:05.840
Microsoft's already figured it out.

34:05.840 --> 34:10.840
Well, I think this is one of those things where maybe the PlayStation 3 should have waited a year before launching.

34:10.840 --> 34:14.840
Because it sounds like this is one of those things that they just didn't implement in the system and now it's too late.

34:14.840 --> 34:16.840
Although, I would think they could do a firmware upgrade.

34:16.840 --> 34:18.840
I mean, they do those pretty frequently.

34:18.840 --> 34:21.840
This was from the last firmware upgrade.

34:21.840 --> 34:22.840
Huh.

34:22.840 --> 34:24.840
But, it's just,

34:24.840 --> 34:26.840
it seems like more of a case to be like,

34:26.840 --> 34:28.840
Oh crap, we should have done that here.

34:28.840 --> 34:31.840
Oh well, it's a free service, so whatever.

34:31.840 --> 34:33.840
Don't implement it when they feel like it.

34:33.840 --> 34:36.840
I guess that's true, at least they don't charge.

34:36.840 --> 34:39.840
And if you want to play games on Xbox Live, you've got to pay.

34:39.840 --> 34:41.840
Don't charge and it shows.

34:41.840 --> 34:43.840
Well, anyway.

34:43.840 --> 34:45.840
Anyways,

34:45.840 --> 34:49.840
however, retailers are charging for games and here's what's coming out this week.

34:49.840 --> 34:53.840
Not a whole lot and it's a lot of leftovers, actually.

34:53.840 --> 34:58.840
Anyways, Blacksite Area 51 is finally making its way out on the PlayStation 3.

34:58.840 --> 35:01.840
Way to be on top of things, Midway.

35:01.840 --> 35:05.840
Go Unreal Tournament 3 Engine, or Unreal Engine 3, whatever.

35:06.840 --> 35:08.840
Speaking of Unreal,

35:08.840 --> 35:11.840
Unreal Tournament 3 is coming out this week on PS3 as well.

35:12.840 --> 35:16.840
Universe at War, Earth Assault on the PC.

35:16.840 --> 35:20.840
Warriors of the Lost Empire on PSP.

35:21.840 --> 35:23.840
Let's see here.

35:23.840 --> 35:29.840
NCAA March of Madness 2008 coming out on PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, and 360.

35:29.840 --> 35:32.840
Luxor 2 on the DS.

35:32.840 --> 35:34.840
Hooray.

35:35.840 --> 35:37.840
Let's see here.

35:37.840 --> 35:39.840
Super Swing Golf Season 2.

35:39.840 --> 35:42.840
That's going to be coming out, in case you like the last one.

35:44.840 --> 35:46.840
I don't know how many people are getting this.

35:46.840 --> 35:48.840
Madden NFL 08 Español.

35:49.840 --> 35:50.840
The Spanish version.

35:50.840 --> 35:51.840
Hey, you know what?

35:51.840 --> 35:55.840
It makes the game appealing to an audience that maybe wasn't able to get into it before, you know?

35:55.840 --> 35:58.840
Exactly. Now with more luchadors.

35:59.840 --> 36:01.840
Unfortunately, that's not true.

36:01.840 --> 36:03.840
The luchadors are great.

36:04.840 --> 36:05.840
Is that it?

36:07.840 --> 36:09.840
Let's see.

36:09.840 --> 36:11.840
No, that's not it.

36:11.840 --> 36:13.840
The Golden Compass on PC.

36:13.840 --> 36:16.840
Oh, goodie! I'm so glad we have that.

36:16.840 --> 36:19.840
Showtime Boxing on the Wii.

36:19.840 --> 36:22.840
And...

36:23.840 --> 36:25.840
And that's it.

36:25.840 --> 36:30.840
And we move on to Japanese release dates, starting off on the Xbox 360.

36:30.840 --> 36:35.840
Kingdom Under Fire, Circle of Doom comes out this week in Japan.

36:35.840 --> 36:45.840
Also Smash Court Tennis 3, Stuntman Ignition, and the Castle of Shikigami 3 comes out as well on the Xbox 360.

36:45.840 --> 36:51.840
Moving on to the PlayStation 3, Gran Turismo 5 Prologue makes its way to the PlayStation 3.

36:51.840 --> 36:55.840
And, of course, there's a new racing wheel coming out in Japan to go with that.

36:55.840 --> 36:58.840
Timed just in time on the Nintendo Wii.

36:58.840 --> 37:05.840
Chocobo's Dungeon, Tokiwasure no Meikyu is coming out from Squeenix is coming out on the Nintendo Wii.

37:05.840 --> 37:17.840
Also, Knights Journey of Dreams, or as they call in Japan, Knights Hoshifuru Yoru no Monogatari is coming out this week.

37:17.840 --> 37:19.840
Shanghai comes out.

37:19.840 --> 37:23.840
I don't know if that's a redone version of the old Mahjong game, but I don't know.

37:23.840 --> 37:25.840
That comes out on the Nintendo Wii. I somehow doubt that.

37:25.840 --> 37:28.840
Soul Calibur Legends also makes its way to the Nintendo Wii.

37:28.840 --> 37:31.840
Another version of the Castle of Shikigami 3.

37:31.840 --> 37:35.840
And, We Love Golf also comes out on the Nintendo Wii.

37:35.840 --> 37:37.840
That's coming over here in February, I believe.

37:37.840 --> 37:38.840
Is it?

37:38.840 --> 37:39.840
It's a Capcom one.

37:39.840 --> 37:40.840
All right.

37:40.840 --> 37:43.840
Also coming out on other systems, we have the PlayStation 2 gets.

37:43.840 --> 37:49.840
Hakurina Heart comes out as well as Spectral Gene, and that's all the PS2 gets this week.

37:49.840 --> 37:57.840
And coming out on the Nintendo DS, Fuji no Mori no Let's Tarot is coming out.

37:57.840 --> 37:58.840
What?

37:58.840 --> 38:02.840
I wonder if that's a tarot card game. I don't know.

38:02.840 --> 38:09.840
And Kuru Kuru Princess Yumi no White Quartet comes out as well this week on the DS.

38:09.840 --> 38:14.840
And lastly but not leastly, we have the PSP gets.

38:14.840 --> 38:16.840
Innocent Life comes out.

38:16.840 --> 38:19.840
Oh, actually, that's just a price reduction.

38:19.840 --> 38:20.840
Comes out.

38:20.840 --> 38:26.840
And also, just for you guys in chat, Dustcat Portable 2 makes its way out this week.

38:26.840 --> 38:27.840
You know what I need to do, Rob?

38:27.840 --> 38:28.840
What?

38:28.840 --> 38:30.840
I need to put up that picture I took of you at Best Buy.

38:30.840 --> 38:32.840
Oh, with Imagine Babies?

38:32.840 --> 38:34.840
Yeah, we found Imagine Babies.

38:34.840 --> 38:35.840
Very interesting game.

38:35.840 --> 38:40.840
Yes, Fuji no Mori no Let's Tarot does look to be a tarot card game for the DS.

38:40.840 --> 38:41.840
That sounds like fun.

38:41.840 --> 38:42.840
Yumi wants.

38:42.840 --> 38:47.840
And Shanghai is indeed a version of the old Mahjong classic on the Nintendo Wii.

38:47.840 --> 38:49.840
It is indeed that.

38:49.840 --> 38:51.840
There you have it, your Japanese release dates.

38:51.840 --> 38:56.840
Well, for our friends in the UK, not a whole bunch is coming out.

38:56.840 --> 39:04.840
On the 14th is Beowulf, Half-Life 2 Episode 2, Portal, Team Fortress 2, The Orange...

39:04.840 --> 39:06.840
Wait, did I already do these?

39:06.840 --> 39:09.840
You know it says December.

39:09.840 --> 39:12.840
I'm like, okay, it's being all bizarre.

39:12.840 --> 39:17.840
Yeah, Beowulf, Half-Life 2 Episode 2, Portal, Team Fortress 2, and then The Orange Box.

39:17.840 --> 39:19.840
They are releasing them separately.

39:19.840 --> 39:22.840
Time Shift and Wipeout Pulse.

39:22.840 --> 39:29.840
And of course all of the Half-Life related things were on PlayStation 3.

39:29.840 --> 39:32.840
Alright, kind of a slow week over in the UK.

39:32.840 --> 39:33.840
Yep.

39:33.840 --> 39:34.840
Oh well.

39:34.840 --> 39:37.840
Maybe it'll get a little more busy before the end of the year.

39:37.840 --> 39:40.840
Or at least early next year when they start getting all the stuff that we got this year.

39:40.840 --> 39:42.840
Poor guys over there.

39:42.840 --> 39:49.840
I will be more than happy to send gifts overseas if people send me any booze.

39:49.840 --> 39:50.840
Money!

39:50.840 --> 39:51.840
Alright.

39:51.840 --> 39:55.840
Let's get back into the gaming news.

39:55.840 --> 40:01.840
Anyways, it's another week so that means there must be another Korean MMO coming.

40:01.840 --> 40:05.840
And this time it's going to be a game called Perfect K.O.

40:05.840 --> 40:10.840
It's actually a fighting game MMO and it's got an unlikely duo of characters that are

40:10.840 --> 40:12.840
going to be making their way to it.

40:12.840 --> 40:17.840
And those two characters, of course, would be Ken and Chung Lee from the Street Fighter

40:17.840 --> 40:18.840
series.

40:18.840 --> 40:19.840
It actually looks kind of neat.

40:19.840 --> 40:23.840
It's sort of like a 3D brawl game or something like that.

40:23.840 --> 40:28.840
And then of course as you beat up more people you can customize your avatar and that kind

40:28.840 --> 40:30.840
of fun stuff.

40:30.840 --> 40:34.840
But that's kind of neat to see that they're actually licensing characters from Capcom.

40:34.840 --> 40:39.840
Hopefully they'll license characters from some other things.

40:39.840 --> 40:40.840
That's going to be interesting.

40:40.840 --> 40:42.840
What other kind of characters are in this game besides Ken and Chung Lee?

40:42.840 --> 40:43.840
They didn't really mention.

40:43.840 --> 40:47.840
It's a lot of stuff that they've designed themselves but the character designs are really

40:47.840 --> 40:48.840
cool.

40:48.840 --> 40:55.840
It'd be nice to see some of these characters from this Korean game move over to say Street

40:55.840 --> 40:57.840
Fighter IV or something like that.

40:57.840 --> 41:00.840
Speaking of Street Fighter IV, there were a lot of new details released this week.

41:00.840 --> 41:01.840
First off, I've got to ask though.

41:01.840 --> 41:06.840
Did you hear about the drama going on behind the Street Fighter IV news?

41:06.840 --> 41:12.840
This Brazilian news site put out these screenshots from Street Fighter IV, these new screenshots

41:12.840 --> 41:14.840
besides the one we'd seen previously.

41:14.840 --> 41:18.840
They put out some new screenshots and one up sick the lawyers on them.

41:18.840 --> 41:20.840
Or as if Davis were to say, sick the lawyers on them.

41:20.840 --> 41:26.840
And people were like, rah, rah, rah, the corporation's taken down the independent voice and certainly

41:26.840 --> 41:28.840
I was kind of going a little bit of that too.

41:28.840 --> 41:30.840
I'm like, boy those bastards, da da da.

41:30.840 --> 41:35.840
But at the same time it turns out, who knew that actually the leak came from the fact

41:35.840 --> 41:39.840
that the person that runs that website is some type of contractor for EGM in Brazil.

41:39.840 --> 41:44.840
So he actually did steal internal information, I guess ended up admitting to it.

41:44.840 --> 41:46.840
So I don't know why he did that.

41:46.840 --> 41:47.840
Wasn't smart.

41:47.840 --> 41:50.840
Maybe he thought it was already out in America or something.

41:50.840 --> 41:52.840
No, he just wanted to leak it.

41:52.840 --> 41:55.840
No one wins here except for us.

41:55.840 --> 41:56.840
That's right.

41:56.840 --> 41:58.840
The users win because we got all that information.

41:58.840 --> 41:59.840
We got three screenshots.

41:59.840 --> 42:00.840
That's right, new screenshot.

42:00.840 --> 42:03.840
But honestly, they didn't give you that much more.

42:03.840 --> 42:05.840
It was all on the same stage still.

42:05.840 --> 42:08.840
I think one was a fireball shot, which was kind of cool, but that was really it.

42:08.840 --> 42:11.840
But some other information did come out.

42:11.840 --> 42:15.840
And EGM is not happy about it because this is how they were going to sell their magazines this week.

42:15.840 --> 42:18.840
The game will actually run at 60 frames per second.

42:18.840 --> 42:23.840
The storyline takes place between Super Street Fighter II Turbo and Street Fighter III.

42:23.840 --> 42:26.840
Lots of old school characters will return.

42:26.840 --> 42:31.840
There's going to be two new female characters, but no characters from Street Fighter III.

42:31.840 --> 42:35.840
So you kind of wonder if Capcom isn't just kind of writing off Street Fighter III in a way.

42:35.840 --> 42:41.840
They should have brought that guy's name Oro back, but he can have both of his arms this time.

42:41.840 --> 42:44.840
And then in Street Fighter IV, he loses the arms.

42:44.840 --> 42:45.840
You know, continuity.

42:45.840 --> 42:47.840
You never know.

42:47.840 --> 42:49.840
Actually, I don't think that he lost his arm.

42:49.840 --> 42:52.840
I think it's tied behind his back.

42:52.840 --> 42:53.840
Whatever.

42:53.840 --> 42:54.840
He had one arm.

42:54.840 --> 42:55.840
That's all that matters to me.

42:55.840 --> 42:57.840
I don't care if he's tied behind his back.

42:57.840 --> 43:00.840
Whatever he wants to do with his severed limb is fine with me.

43:00.840 --> 43:07.840
As most people speculated, the screenshots that you do see in the pictures floating around the Internet right now is Chun-Li's new stage.

43:07.840 --> 43:10.840
The parry system that was in Street Fighter III, gone.

43:10.840 --> 43:14.840
New system in place, it's called Saving Revenge, something like that.

43:14.840 --> 43:16.840
Some new system is in place.

43:16.840 --> 43:21.840
It's built around cancels, and there will be its own gauge that's separate from the super meter.

43:21.840 --> 43:22.840
There are supers in the game.

43:22.840 --> 43:25.840
Don't know if it's Street Fighter III's or Super Street Fighter II Turbos.

43:25.840 --> 43:27.840
There's also ultras.

43:27.840 --> 43:29.840
My God, there's lots of different types of moves.

43:29.840 --> 43:31.840
Here's the other weird thing.

43:31.840 --> 43:34.840
Shang-Long may actually be in the game.

43:34.840 --> 43:38.840
But there's kind of a May, and we don't know if that's just a running gag from EGM,

43:38.840 --> 43:42.840
because that was one of their first April Fools jokes years ago.

43:42.840 --> 43:45.840
Back when I used to get that magazine delivered to my house, like 15 years ago.

43:45.840 --> 43:47.840
Back when it was good.

43:47.840 --> 43:50.840
Back in the day, certainly.

43:50.840 --> 43:54.840
And rumor is, we will see Street Fighter IV in the arcades with online play,

43:54.840 --> 43:58.840
also in the PlayStation 3 and 360, all of them online.

43:58.840 --> 44:02.840
Wouldn't it be cool if the console versions interfaced with the arcade somehow?

44:02.840 --> 44:05.840
Of course, then you kind of wonder why would anybody go to the arcade,

44:05.840 --> 44:08.840
but community, and maybe there will be something special the arcade version has there.

44:08.840 --> 44:10.840
If it did, it'd probably be only with the PlayStation 3 version,

44:10.840 --> 44:14.840
since you've got Live, and Live isn't cross-platform, very easy.

44:14.840 --> 44:17.840
Well, they've got Final Fantasy XI to work somehow, so it's possible.

44:17.840 --> 44:20.840
Yeah, but see, Final Fantasy XI runs off the Square Enix servers,

44:20.840 --> 44:23.840
because you're connecting to Play Online.

44:23.840 --> 44:24.840
That's totally separate.

44:24.840 --> 44:27.840
That's why you have to pay that stupid monthly fee.

44:27.840 --> 44:31.840
So anyways, obviously take some of that stuff with a grain of salt,

44:31.840 --> 44:35.840
in regards to Shang-Long and the online arcade stuff.

44:35.840 --> 44:36.840
Take all that with a grain of salt.

44:36.840 --> 44:39.840
But it does sound, as far as the rest of it, that it's pretty cemented.

44:39.840 --> 44:43.840
I mean, the 60 frames a second and stuff, it sounds like it's going to be a winner.

44:43.840 --> 44:46.840
So I have to say, I'm already a little more excited about Street Fighter IV

44:46.840 --> 44:48.840
than I ever was about Street Fighter III.

44:48.840 --> 44:49.840
It looks pretty good.

44:49.840 --> 44:51.840
I like the art style in it.

44:51.840 --> 44:55.840
I was kind of crossing my fingers that it'd be more like the trailer,

44:55.840 --> 44:56.840
because that was really cool.

44:56.840 --> 44:58.840
But the art style's okay.

44:58.840 --> 45:02.840
I like what they're doing where it's 3D, but it's 2D type thing.

45:02.840 --> 45:05.840
Some of the facial animations, though, that they had,

45:05.840 --> 45:09.840
like some of the screenshots, a little weird.

45:09.840 --> 45:13.840
It looks a little wonky, but I think it'll be fine.

45:13.840 --> 45:15.840
Jamie, I know you've been a Street Fighter fan for ages and ages.

45:15.840 --> 45:18.840
Are you happy about Street Fighter IV?

45:18.840 --> 45:21.840
I'm reserving judgment until I actually play it.

45:21.840 --> 45:23.840
Okay, so you're not letting the hype get to you at all?

45:23.840 --> 45:24.840
Nope.

45:24.840 --> 45:25.840
All right, fair enough.

45:25.840 --> 45:28.840
I still think that it's only going to take a week before

45:28.840 --> 45:32.840
a bunch of fighting game fans completely break the system.

45:32.840 --> 45:34.840
If it is online?

45:34.840 --> 45:36.840
Oh, not just online.

45:36.840 --> 45:38.840
I mean, just the game itself.

45:38.840 --> 45:39.840
That's all dedicated there.

45:39.840 --> 45:41.840
They'll break any fighting game system.

45:41.840 --> 45:43.840
Figure out how to cheat real quick?

45:43.840 --> 45:44.840
We'll see.

45:44.840 --> 45:45.840
We will see.

45:45.840 --> 45:48.840
Anyway, let's move on to some more news.

45:48.840 --> 45:54.840
Well, for the Xbox originals, they are, well, region locked.

45:54.840 --> 45:57.840
You can't get past it.

45:57.840 --> 46:01.840
Where the Japanese demos are working, the games themselves are not.

46:01.840 --> 46:03.840
There's no such thing as can't.

46:03.840 --> 46:05.840
That's what I say.

46:05.840 --> 46:09.840
Just not now is what Loki is hoping for this.

46:09.840 --> 46:11.840
But they got some extra games in Japan.

46:11.840 --> 46:13.840
Well, not necessarily extra, but they got different games in Japan

46:13.840 --> 46:14.840
than we got here, huh?

46:14.840 --> 46:16.840
Here's the problem.

46:16.840 --> 46:17.840
Go ahead. Sorry.

46:17.840 --> 46:21.840
Well, they actually tested, for example, with Magatama.

46:21.840 --> 46:25.840
They said that they got a message that said the download was not

46:25.840 --> 46:28.840
available in your region.

46:28.840 --> 46:31.840
Well, I think it's because it's either looking at one or two things.

46:31.840 --> 46:34.840
It's either looking at the region of your console, which case,

46:34.840 --> 46:36.840
yeah, you're kind of screwed then.

46:36.840 --> 46:39.840
Or it's looking at the region of your IP.

46:39.840 --> 46:42.840
If that's the case, you could probably just route your IP through

46:42.840 --> 46:47.840
like a mirror, say somewhere overseas, and it might work.

46:47.840 --> 46:49.840
But I'm guessing it's looking at the region of your console

46:49.840 --> 46:51.840
because that would make more sense.

46:51.840 --> 46:52.840
But it's weird, though.

46:52.840 --> 46:55.840
It just won't let you download it whatsoever.

46:55.840 --> 46:56.840
Who cares?

46:56.840 --> 46:57.840
It's a fucking Xbox game.

46:57.840 --> 46:58.840
Seriously.

46:58.840 --> 47:00.840
I mean, if you...

47:00.840 --> 47:02.840
I don't know.

47:02.840 --> 47:03.840
It's an Xbox game.

47:03.840 --> 47:04.840
Do you really need to download it?

47:04.840 --> 47:05.840
It's old.

47:05.840 --> 47:07.840
Play something new.

47:07.840 --> 47:08.840
I don't know.

47:08.840 --> 47:12.840
I'm noticing that because of the old Xbox games coming back,

47:12.840 --> 47:15.840
I've had a lot of friends tell me the Indigo Prophecy,

47:15.840 --> 47:18.840
kind of a game that may have been, I don't want to say overlooked

47:18.840 --> 47:21.840
because it certainly had its fans, but overlooked by many

47:21.840 --> 47:24.840
is kind of getting a little bit of a resurgence with this.

47:24.840 --> 47:26.840
And I've had people actually send me messages on Xbox Live

47:26.840 --> 47:28.840
going, dude, you need to check out Indigo Prophecy

47:28.840 --> 47:29.840
if you haven't already played it before.

47:29.840 --> 47:31.840
It's kind of fun.

47:31.840 --> 47:33.840
Go buy it in the stores, people.

47:33.840 --> 47:35.840
It's probably cheaper than buying it online.

47:35.840 --> 47:36.840
Seriously.

47:36.840 --> 47:39.840
And then you get the disk and maybe a manual.

47:39.840 --> 47:42.840
I mean, instead of having to read a PDF file online,

47:42.840 --> 47:44.840
just go look.

47:44.840 --> 47:48.840
This stuff is so old, it's probably dirt cheap by now.

47:48.840 --> 47:50.840
I guess there's one way to find out.

47:50.840 --> 47:51.840
You've got to go out there and shop.

47:51.840 --> 47:53.840
Oh, you want to hear something funny?

47:53.840 --> 47:54.840
What is it?

47:54.840 --> 47:55.840
Ha ha ha.

47:55.840 --> 47:56.840
Shut up.

47:56.840 --> 47:59.840
Anyways, Katamari Damacy.

47:59.840 --> 48:04.840
That game, when it came out, that was like a $20 game, wasn't it?

48:04.840 --> 48:05.840
The original one on PlayStation 2?

48:05.840 --> 48:06.840
Yeah.

48:06.840 --> 48:07.840
That was a budget game, $19.99.

48:07.840 --> 48:08.840
$20 game.

48:08.840 --> 48:11.840
It's only used at GameStop for 30 bucks.

48:11.840 --> 48:15.840
I'm like, 10 bucks over retail, and it's used.

48:15.840 --> 48:16.840
Right.

48:16.840 --> 48:18.840
But that's because they don't make it retail anymore, right?

48:18.840 --> 48:19.840
It doesn't matter, though.

48:19.840 --> 48:21.840
It should still be cheap.

48:21.840 --> 48:24.840
Well, what about, okay, what about, like, frickin' old-ass PlayStation 1 games?

48:24.840 --> 48:27.840
Like, for the longest time, Intelligent Cube, they were charging an arm and a leg for.

48:27.840 --> 48:30.840
Symphony of the Night, before it was out on Xbox Live, they were charging...

48:30.840 --> 48:34.840
I didn't think Katamari, the first one, had a really high demand for it.

48:34.840 --> 48:37.840
And, like, Street Fighter, was it Marvel vs. Street Fighter 2?

48:37.840 --> 48:40.840
That's going for, you know, quite a bit.

48:40.840 --> 48:44.840
Or Marvel vs. Capcom 2.

48:44.840 --> 48:49.840
But, um, I didn't think Katamari was, like, you know, going to bring in a demand of $10

48:49.840 --> 48:50.840
over retail.

48:50.840 --> 48:51.840
Especially used.

48:51.840 --> 48:57.840
Well, uh, let's go ahead and move on with the news.

48:57.840 --> 49:02.840
Anyways, there's yet another stupid lawsuit that goes with Halo 3.

49:02.840 --> 49:05.840
It's like, Halo 3, more stupid lawsuits.

49:05.840 --> 49:10.840
This time, some dumb shit is complaining that there's not a lot of, um, there's some pixels

49:10.840 --> 49:11.840
missing, apparently.

49:11.840 --> 49:18.840
Because, apparently, uh, Halo 3, you know, has upscaled 640p, I guess, is missing 80

49:18.840 --> 49:21.840
pixels, and they explain why they did that and stuff.

49:21.840 --> 49:26.840
So now they're suing because it's not truly 720p.

49:26.840 --> 49:29.840
And they're saying it's false advertising.

49:29.840 --> 49:30.840
What?

49:30.840 --> 49:31.840
For real?

49:31.840 --> 49:33.840
This verse is for real?

49:33.840 --> 49:38.840
That's sad, and, you know what, I heard about this, and I actually looked at the back of

49:38.840 --> 49:45.840
the box, and on the back it just says, HDTV, you know, 720p, 1080i, 1080p.

49:45.840 --> 49:49.840
It doesn't explicitly say, this game runs natively in these formats.

49:49.840 --> 49:50.840
But what game does?

49:50.840 --> 49:51.840
None of them do.

49:51.840 --> 49:52.840
No, none of them.

49:52.840 --> 49:55.840
And here's the thing, is I would say, okay, why don't you count the pixels that are on

49:55.840 --> 49:56.840
your TV there?

49:56.840 --> 49:57.840
720 of them?

49:57.840 --> 49:58.840
Okay.

49:58.840 --> 49:59.840
Shut up.

49:59.840 --> 50:05.340
So they're trying to say it's false advertising because the game wasn't programmed in 720

50:05.340 --> 50:06.340
or whatever.

50:06.340 --> 50:07.340
Whatever, dude.

50:07.340 --> 50:10.340
That is seriously a stupid complaint.

50:10.340 --> 50:12.040
That's gonna get thrown out.

50:12.040 --> 50:14.040
I hope so.

50:14.040 --> 50:19.960
Well, all I know is that all these freaking Halo 3 lawsuits, god damn they make us mad,

50:19.960 --> 50:37.120
and when we get mad, people die.

50:37.120 --> 50:42.240
It is time for my annual Christmas FU.

50:42.240 --> 50:47.760
It's a combination of everything about the holiday season that pisses me off.

50:47.760 --> 50:53.320
So, and again, it's all pretty ridiculous, you know, I'm not attacking anybody, but first

50:53.320 --> 50:57.320
of all, the people who over-decorate their houses that look like Christmas puked all

50:57.320 --> 51:01.760
over their house, oh my god, learn what aesthetics are for.

51:01.760 --> 51:04.520
Seriously, what about that tree?

51:04.520 --> 51:05.520
This outside...

51:05.520 --> 51:07.760
Did I not tell you that tree was hideous?

51:07.760 --> 51:09.680
It's okay.

51:09.680 --> 51:13.400
And Rob put it best when he told me about it at first, that the whole top part of the

51:13.400 --> 51:17.440
tree is not lit because probably a light bulb burnt out.

51:17.440 --> 51:22.520
There's this ginormous tree in front of a church, and it's like it's not wearing a top,

51:22.520 --> 51:24.520
because a bulb burned out at the top of the tree.

51:24.520 --> 51:25.520
This is what I think, though.

51:25.520 --> 51:26.520
I don't think that's it.

51:26.520 --> 51:30.160
I think they didn't, they just actually didn't decorate it, because there's different types

51:30.160 --> 51:31.160
of lights.

51:31.160 --> 51:35.420
There's a loop of white lights going around it, and then there's multicolored lights,

51:35.420 --> 51:41.440
and then, and then that one, that place that had the Christmas crap everywhere.

51:41.440 --> 51:45.200
I was like, oh my god, now I understand being into the season, and I understand having a

51:45.200 --> 51:47.720
few lights, and you know, and that's cool.

51:47.720 --> 51:51.280
I love to see things that are tastefully decorated.

51:51.280 --> 51:54.560
Like, we have some tacky Christmas lights here in the studio.

51:54.560 --> 51:55.560
That's cute.

51:55.560 --> 51:59.160
You know, I can, like, the icicle lights are nice.

51:59.160 --> 52:03.960
Maybe having a Santa in your front yard or decorating a tree in your front yard, but

52:03.960 --> 52:09.640
like, this is the worst example ever, and it's one house that was in Mobile, Alabama,

52:09.640 --> 52:15.080
that I saw right before, probably the year I moved out, and that was these people who

52:15.080 --> 52:19.900
strung Christmas lights all over their yard, across their yard, in patches.

52:19.900 --> 52:25.100
Their house freaking glowed, and I was like, and on top of it, they were all multicolored,

52:25.100 --> 52:28.080
so it looked like that cut light just, like, throw up.

52:28.080 --> 52:31.760
I'm not joking, and that originated the phrase Christmas threw up on that house.

52:31.760 --> 52:36.160
I saw a very offensive house last night, and it was one of those houses where they had

52:36.160 --> 52:42.080
the radio station playing, and you tune your car to a certain frequency on the radio, and

52:42.080 --> 52:46.760
then you can, like, the lights flash in sync with the music, right?

52:46.760 --> 52:50.480
Okay, but it's hideous, because if you don't have the radio station turned on, it just

52:50.480 --> 52:55.680
looks like this house is randomly flashing all of their lights, like, and I swear to

52:55.680 --> 52:56.680
God, I almost had a seizure driving.

52:56.680 --> 52:58.480
The house is having a seizure.

52:58.480 --> 53:00.840
I almost had a fucking seizure driving by that house.

53:00.840 --> 53:01.840
It's not funny.

53:01.840 --> 53:04.960
Like, seriously, somebody is going to crash into that house, and all the kids in that

53:04.960 --> 53:09.440
house are going to be in a fire, because that house is going to cause somebody to have a

53:09.440 --> 53:10.440
seizure.

53:10.440 --> 53:15.080
And on top of that, imagine these people's freaking power bill, you know, but anyway,

53:15.080 --> 53:20.400
and the other part, another part of my, um, my, uh, F.U. goes towards, um, people who

53:20.400 --> 53:24.200
are thinking that Christmas is the actually only the celebration that happens around this

53:24.200 --> 53:29.200
year, when there's a bunch of different religions that celebrate around the same, you know,

53:29.200 --> 53:35.120
time every year, and that really Christmas should actually be in, like, spring, if you're,

53:35.120 --> 53:39.320
if you're going by, quote, biblical standards, because the census would have happened in

53:39.320 --> 53:42.200
the spring, and you guys stole a pagan holiday.

53:42.200 --> 53:45.400
Thank you, Catholic Church, but, you know.

53:45.400 --> 53:47.160
You can address those cards and letters to Jamie at Orange.

53:47.160 --> 53:48.160
I'll show you that.

53:48.160 --> 53:51.440
What about the people that have the big inflatable snow globes in their front lawn?

53:51.440 --> 53:53.040
You gotta love that shit, huh?

53:53.040 --> 54:01.440
Okay, I don't mind one, but I drove by a house that had three, and a giant inflatable Santa,

54:01.440 --> 54:05.720
whose legs were broken, so he was laying on his nose.

54:05.720 --> 54:06.720
This is in my neighborhood.

54:06.720 --> 54:09.020
That's a prime target for a BB gun drive.

54:09.020 --> 54:10.400
Someone broke Santa's legs?

54:10.400 --> 54:11.400
That's not very nice.

54:11.400 --> 54:12.400
Someone broke Santa's legs.

54:12.400 --> 54:14.960
Santa gives a mobster his present this year.

54:14.960 --> 54:21.880
But, but no, I, there's just, you know, I, I really, it's the whole over-commercialism

54:21.880 --> 54:26.280
of everything, and the, the fact that people get so close-minded, okay, here's part three

54:26.280 --> 54:27.680
of my Christmas F.U.

54:27.680 --> 54:28.680
Oh, Christ.

54:28.680 --> 54:29.680
Drivers!

54:29.680 --> 54:35.720
Because I can't do an F.U. without bringing up how stupidly mean people get during the

54:35.720 --> 54:36.720
holidays!

54:36.720 --> 54:43.760
Okay, I, I went to buy something at the store, and this person's pushing past me, buying

54:43.760 --> 54:47.480
their Christmas tree, and I'm like, I was in line for-

54:47.480 --> 54:48.480
AHHH!

54:48.480 --> 54:49.480
I'm like, shit!

54:49.480 --> 54:54.280
And then, and then everybody drives, like, a freakin' retard on the road, because they

54:54.280 --> 54:57.120
have to get to the mall, ooh.

54:57.120 --> 55:03.400
And it's just like, okay, what happened to the whole, you know, being nice to everybody

55:03.400 --> 55:08.200
during the holidays, and trying to, to share the spirit and everything, because people

55:08.200 --> 55:12.600
don't give a shit about the Christmas spirit, they care about their own personal agenda.

55:12.600 --> 55:17.000
You know, maybe there should be more ball shootings, if that were the case.

55:17.000 --> 55:18.000
Whoa!

55:18.000 --> 55:19.000
Whoa!

55:19.000 --> 55:22.600
I wouldn't go there, wow, too soon, too soon.

55:22.600 --> 55:27.520
No, no, no, no, but, but this is the whole thing, is that, you know, people are, you

55:27.520 --> 55:33.760
know, and I'm getting this from the same people, where they're all like, oh, well, you know,

55:33.760 --> 55:39.120
holiday this, you know, have to be nice, baby Jesus, whatever, and then these same people

55:39.120 --> 55:44.640
are being complete and utter assholes, and I'm, I'm not even, you know, making this up,

55:44.640 --> 55:51.120
I'm seeing people that I know do this, and I'm like, God, what a freakin' hypocrite, you

55:51.120 --> 55:52.120
know?

55:52.120 --> 55:55.720
Just, don't open your mouth around me ever again.

55:55.720 --> 56:00.160
Alright, quick chatroom comments, this is J100Matt, says, apparently the higher your

56:00.160 --> 56:02.760
energy bill, the more Jesus and God love you.

56:02.760 --> 56:03.760
That's brilliant.

56:03.760 --> 56:06.920
Alright, let's move on with the FUs.

56:06.920 --> 56:14.240
Anyways, FU2, the kids across the street from my apartment complex were having car wash

56:14.240 --> 56:15.240
today.

56:15.240 --> 56:20.960
They started at about nine this morning, yelling, oh, by the way, there was also one of those

56:20.960 --> 56:24.320
cars, you know, the ones that have the sound systems that are way too loud with way too

56:24.320 --> 56:31.800
much bass, that was playing from nine in the morning to about five in the afternoon, and

56:31.800 --> 56:39.040
these kids yelling, car wash, car wash, car wash, for like seven fucking hours, I mean,

56:39.040 --> 56:42.640
it's just so annoying all day long.

56:42.640 --> 56:47.280
Oh, and then also, FU2, my neighbors who apparently thought it was fun to have a party at four

56:47.280 --> 56:52.960
in the morning with their drunken friends who were riding a bike that some kid left

56:52.960 --> 56:56.840
outside and you're honking the horn on the bike, so no.

56:56.840 --> 57:00.720
Wow, you live in a classy part of town, that sucks.

57:00.720 --> 57:01.720
That's it.

57:01.720 --> 57:05.560
Uh, puppy, why don't you go ahead.

57:05.560 --> 57:13.200
Big FU to ITT Technical Institute and your terrible scheduling policies, because I tried,

57:13.200 --> 57:17.280
I started my program for drafting last year.

57:17.280 --> 57:22.280
I should have been done by now, but I'm not going to graduate until six months from now

57:22.280 --> 57:27.360
because when I change my schedule once, it can really fuck me up for the rest of the

57:27.360 --> 57:28.360
year.

57:28.360 --> 57:31.720
It's like, oh yeah, we'll get a teacher to teach that one class for you since you didn't

57:31.720 --> 57:35.840
get to finish it in that quarter, and they didn't offer it for three more quarters, so

57:35.840 --> 57:40.360
now I'm really behind, and it's going to cost me more money, and I'm pissed, and now I have

57:40.360 --> 57:42.440
to take four classes this quarter.

57:42.440 --> 57:50.600
Um, well, I don't think I really have any FUs myself, um, I'm actually kind of having

57:50.600 --> 57:56.200
a good week, so I guess FU to the fact that it's been so cold lately, I'll give a FU that,

57:56.200 --> 58:01.000
my house has been very cold lately, and, um, you know, since we live in California, we're

58:01.000 --> 58:04.560
very spoiled when it comes to cold, and just the slightest bit of cold air, it's like,

58:04.560 --> 58:12.520
oh my god, get a jacket, FU to magazine solicitors too, I had three of them on my door this week.

58:12.520 --> 58:16.680
Somebody came to my door last night, and I told him that I had the flu, and that I was

58:16.680 --> 58:21.040
highly contagious, and he really should leave.

58:21.040 --> 58:23.560
I'm not making that up either, he's great.

58:23.560 --> 58:26.120
He just looked at me like, okay, bye.

58:26.120 --> 58:27.120
Wow.

58:27.120 --> 58:28.120
I should have thought of that.

58:28.120 --> 58:31.280
Around in this neighborhood, they just have the kids do all this listing, because it's

58:31.280 --> 58:34.120
kind of hard to tell a kid that, you know, you're going to give them bubonic plague if

58:34.120 --> 58:35.680
they don't get off your doorstep.

58:35.680 --> 58:40.560
Or you just, you know, open your door wearing nothing but a towel.

58:40.560 --> 58:46.600
I still, though, have my favorite story about my friend with the Jehovah's Witnesses, while

58:46.600 --> 58:52.600
she was listening to Tubular Bells, making a red velvet cake, so she came out with this

58:52.600 --> 58:59.760
knife with, like, red fluid on it, and said, WHAT?

58:59.760 --> 59:04.960
This is my friend that used to work for Lockheed.

59:04.960 --> 59:06.720
Alright, let's move on.

59:06.720 --> 59:09.320
We gotta get back to gaming news, weirdos.

59:09.320 --> 59:13.680
Alright, oh, and what a heck of a story to get back into.

59:13.680 --> 59:17.960
Yes, our buddy Jeff Girtzman, which took up about an hour of last week's show.

59:17.960 --> 59:21.240
We have some quick updates, and I don't want to spend too much time talking in this, because

59:21.240 --> 59:25.000
I'll be goddamn if this story just didn't blow up way more than it should have.

59:25.000 --> 59:26.560
You gotta fire it, get over it.

59:26.560 --> 59:27.560
Yeah, exactly.

59:27.560 --> 59:28.560
Anyhow.

59:28.560 --> 59:29.560
Was it that crap you were talking about?

59:29.560 --> 59:34.880
Yeah, I was trying to catch Jamie up on what happened when she was out, so anyhow, here's

59:34.880 --> 59:35.880
your updates.

59:35.880 --> 59:37.800
I should have some music that plays during this.

59:37.800 --> 59:38.800
Hold on, I need music.

59:38.800 --> 59:42.000
Jamie, why don't you give us your thoughts on the issue while we get some happy music

59:42.000 --> 59:43.800
to play during the Girtzman update.

59:43.800 --> 59:44.800
Happy music?

59:44.800 --> 59:45.800
Should we play some Lincoln Park?

59:45.800 --> 59:46.800
There's too much fun in this.

59:46.800 --> 59:53.680
Oh, it's too bad that I don't have the song from End of Evangelion, the happy suicide

59:53.680 --> 59:54.680
song.

59:54.680 --> 59:55.680
Alright, hold on.

59:55.680 --> 59:57.680
We'll play some happy music here while we give you the Jeff Girtzman update.

59:57.680 --> 59:58.680
I agree too, and stars.

59:58.680 --> 01:00:01.680
Oh yeah, I got it.

01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:04.360
Alright.

01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:10.760
This week in Girtzmanville, Girtzman made a comment to Joystick.com.

01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:16.560
Saying, quote, I stand behind my work, regardless of where I do it.

01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:21.760
If there was content that I felt I couldn't support, it wouldn't see the light of day.

01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:27.320
Then later on, this week, GameSpot posted a Q&A.

01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:31.760
Here's a clip from the Q&A, question, was Eidos Interactive upset by the game's review?

01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:36.700
Answer, it has been confirmed that Eidos representatives expressed their displeasure to their appropriate

01:00:36.700 --> 01:00:39.280
contacts at GameSpot, but not to editorial directly.

01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:43.040
It was not the first time a publisher has voiced disappointment with the game review,

01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:44.240
and it won't be the last.

01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:49.440
However, it is strict GameSpot policy never to let any such feelings result in a review

01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:52.280
score to be altered or a video review to be pulled.

01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:55.800
Also, I'd like to quote Mr. Horse from Eidos.

01:00:55.800 --> 01:01:01.780
He said, no, sir, I do not like it.

01:01:01.780 --> 01:01:06.560
In response to the GameSpot Q&A, the users of GameSpot said, thank you, you assholes,

01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:09.520
for posting that a whole four days late.

01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:15.100
Then later on this week, as if no more could go wrong with Kane and Lynch, the review site

01:01:15.100 --> 01:01:20.320
got criticized by, I'm sorry, the reviews got criticized by Kotaku.

01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:22.080
They were posting clips of reviews.

01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:27.800
One of the clips happened to be from Kotaku, and it had a five-star logo above the review,

01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:31.320
which makes you think, five-star review.

01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:35.140
But in fact, the five stars were just a graphic, and Kotaku was pissed off because they don't

01:01:35.140 --> 01:01:37.520
review games in stars.

01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:41.120
They don't review games, period.

01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:43.600
So that's from a preview of the game.

01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:48.720
And that's your update on what's going on in Gertsmanville.

01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:49.720
And to be honest, I don't really care anymore.

01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:50.720
Now, stop caring.

01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:51.720
I'm stopped.

01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:52.720
Hey, Rob?

01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:53.720
Yes.

01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:54.720
I didn't care in the first place.

01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:55.920
I'm glad to hear it.

01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:57.640
That's because you're all better people than I.

01:01:57.640 --> 01:02:01.840
That's because I wasn't here, thank God.

01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:02.840
All right.

01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:05.520
Let's move on, then, past Gershman Gate, if we could.

01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:12.080
Well, I have something that's a little happy, except that I think that it was already there.

01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:17.860
There's a press release come out from Gravity that they've opened a US studio under the

01:02:17.860 --> 01:02:24.240
name of L5 Games, and they've hired Blizzard folks to help run it.

01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:30.160
But the thing is that, now, since it's in San Mateo, but I actually remember trying

01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:36.560
to report Gravity to the Better Business Bureau.

01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:38.320
The fuck?

01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:45.720
When I was still on IRO because of some sort of banning of an account that was falsely

01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:46.720
done.

01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:47.720
This was a long time ago.

01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:54.080
But I was trying to find the stuff for somebody to report them to the Better Business Bureau,

01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:58.800
and it turned out that every time I tried to pull up the address for them, it came up

01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:01.280
with a San Mateo address.

01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:05.880
But this was like six years ago that this address was there.

01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:09.200
So I'm like, didn't they already have a US branch?

01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:11.160
Well, apparently the company didn't know.

01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:12.980
That's why they put out the press release.

01:03:12.980 --> 01:03:13.980
Maybe they just had a PO box there.

01:03:13.980 --> 01:03:14.980
Oh, my God, we do?

01:03:14.980 --> 01:03:16.440
We should let everyone know.

01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:19.520
They had a mailboxes, et cetera, box there in San Mateo.

01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:20.520
That's about it.

01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:23.320
What was the Better Business Bureau going to do to them anyways, write them a nasty

01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:24.320
letter?

01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:29.760
Well, you know, buy-write got shut down.

01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:32.560
True.

01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:39.040
And it was pretty much because of all the crappy feedback that came back.

01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:41.120
That's why we have the Better Business Bureau.

01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:43.000
They just supply feedback.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:44.000
Gravity's just coming over to the US.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:48.000
I got free food because I reported a restaurant to the Better Business Bureau.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:52.180
They're going to increase their presence in the US so that Gravity can single-handedly

01:03:52.180 --> 01:03:54.720
take on Activision Blizzard.

01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:55.720
That's what it is, right?

01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:56.720
Good luck.

01:03:56.720 --> 01:03:57.720
All right.

01:03:57.720 --> 01:04:01.400
I'll stick with my private servers.

01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:02.400
Thank you.

01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:07.360
Anyways, let's see here.

01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:10.600
Sometimes you might compare Gravity to Sucking.

01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:15.920
There's service and stuff, so well, here's something else that sucks or that probably

01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:16.920
will suck.

01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:18.680
The Castlevania movie.

01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:24.560
And yeah, okay, let me put it this way, and this will save us a lot of time in the future.

01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:29.640
Every single movie that's probably being written right now is on hold because of the writer's

01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:30.640
strike.

01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:34.280
Because you have no writer, you can't have any story being written.

01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:42.320
So like that, the Castlevania movie is on hold because of the writer's strike.

01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:50.940
Not that it's on hold from Sucking, I guess, I don't know, it's like slowing down a retard

01:04:50.940 --> 01:04:54.880
running towards a cliff or something like that, I mean, as soon as you let go of them,

01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:56.760
they're just going to topple over the end.

01:04:56.760 --> 01:04:57.760
Wow!

01:04:57.760 --> 01:05:02.160
What in the hell is, like, is there something in the air that's causing everybody to make

01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:04.520
very, very unpolitically correct statements tonight?

01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:05.520
I mean, what the hell?

01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:07.440
We're going to get lots of letters this week.

01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:09.920
Where have you been for the last, you know, 300 and some episodes?

01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:13.280
I don't know, in a cave.

01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:14.280
Or 200 and some episodes.

01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:15.280
What episode are we on?

01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:16.280
250?

01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:17.280
259!

01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:19.280
I've been doing 100 more episodes, Sam!

01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:23.040
I've been working way too damn hard, not recording one of them, but you know what?

01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:26.040
I do it for practice.

01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:33.760
Okay, I was going to make some joke about somebody actually writes those video game

01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:38.900
movies, but anyway, I totally lost it amongst Loki's high sense of sarcasm.

01:05:38.900 --> 01:05:42.560
So why don't we spoil the VGAs, which are going on right now on the TV.

01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:46.880
Yes, did you know we're competing against the VGAs tonight, our live stream?

01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:48.440
So here, why don't we ruin it for you?

01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:53.320

you've all been wanting to hear about, Most Addictive Video Game Fueled by Do, Halo 3.

01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:45.400
Sponsored by Do.

01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:47.900
Although I think that was just a joke, actually, yeah.

01:06:47.900 --> 01:06:52.320
So there, we just did you a favor and saved you from sitting through three hours of garbage

01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:54.320
advertisements and musical performances.

01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:55.420
There you have it.

01:06:55.420 --> 01:06:58.760
You can send us the thank you cards, you can send us Christmas cards.

01:06:58.760 --> 01:07:03.920
We'll play Devil's Advocate here and not to pull you away from listening to our wonderful

01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:07.880
show, but they are going to have a new trailer for Borderlands, which looks pretty awesome.

01:07:07.880 --> 01:07:09.400
It'll be on YouTube tomorrow.

01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:11.680
But it looks awesome!

01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:12.680
I want to see it now.

01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:15.720
It'll look awesome tomorrow on YouTube.

01:07:15.720 --> 01:07:21.360
Well, going on a tangent with Spike TV, yesterday I was watching a marathon of one of their

01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:23.600
reality shows because I was bored.

01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:24.600
Cheaters?

01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:27.040
No, it was the Ultimate Fighter.

01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:31.280
It was leading up to their finale UFC thing last night.

01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:35.120
For eight straight hours, there was nothing but teasing about, oh, we're going to show

01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:39.840
the cinematic opening to World of Warcraft during the UFC event.

01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:43.280
And it was the original opening from, you know, three years, it's three years old.

01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:47.320
And they're going to show this on live TV at a UFC event.

01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:51.200
I couldn't, I couldn't think of a worse audience to target that at.

01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:53.560
Chad Compton for the new expansion.

01:07:53.560 --> 01:07:58.280
No, it was the original cinematic opening to the World of Warcraft, it wasn't Burning

01:07:58.280 --> 01:07:59.280
Crusade.

01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:04.340
Comment from Chad, Dark Tetsuya said, the Spike Video Game Awards have been sponsored

01:08:04.340 --> 01:08:12.920
by Harmonix, 2K Games, EA Sports, it's in the game, and by Mountain Dew, do the Dew.

01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:20.800
So in stuff that people actually care about, how about Silent Hill News?

01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:22.000
Ah, yes.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:23.000
Yes please.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:24.480
Silent Hill 5 News?

01:08:24.480 --> 01:08:26.440
Well, more like Silent Hill Origins.

01:08:26.440 --> 01:08:27.440
Ah, okay.

01:08:27.440 --> 01:08:30.800
They're talking about it having a PlayStation 2 port.

01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:32.640
Oh, that'll be kind of fun.

01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:34.880
Yeah, that'll be pretty cool.

01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:43.800
They're saying that it would, it's actually of course being, I think published by Climax.

01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:49.120
And they would also be presenting a second release.

01:08:49.120 --> 01:08:54.160
Hmm, that'll be kind of nice because Silent Hill is one of those games I can't really

01:08:54.160 --> 01:08:55.960
get into on a handheld platform.

01:08:55.960 --> 01:08:59.360
It's kind of something I need on a very large TV with all the lights out so I can cry like

01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:01.600
a little girl when the monsters come out to eat me.

01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:05.800
Yeah, but you see, all you have to do is just get one of those nice PSPs with the video

01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:07.480
out and then you can play it on your TV.

01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:09.920
Ah, that's true, but I don't have that because I'm not cool.

01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:15.160
Well, the second thing that they're working on is actually an unannounced project.

01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:17.240
Dun, dun, dun.

01:09:17.240 --> 01:09:20.560
I hope they just announce it.

01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:21.560
Was that it?

01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:22.560
I don't think that was it.

01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:26.520
Because if you announce an unannounced project, isn't that announcing the project?

01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:27.920
How about an untitled project?

01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:28.920
There you go.

01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:33.440
Or I should say a secret project because it may have a title, we just don't know what

01:09:33.440 --> 01:09:34.440
it is.

01:09:34.440 --> 01:09:38.360
It's not secret anymore if you just talked about it.

01:09:38.360 --> 01:09:41.080
Mac Man in our chat room says something interesting here.

01:09:41.080 --> 01:09:45.480
Mac Man says Silent Hill 5 equals awesome and win and shit in my pants.

01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:50.200
What kind of comment is that?

01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:53.320
Gerardo Mo says Silent Hill needs to go steal all the VGAs.

01:09:53.320 --> 01:09:54.320
Yes, I agree.

01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:55.880
He said that Pyramid Head goes to Silent Hill.

01:09:55.880 --> 01:09:59.600
Pyramid Head needs to come do an acceptance speech and then...

01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:01.120
He'll make it with his big knife.

01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:02.560
That's right.

01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:03.880
To the entire front row.

01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:08.920
And we'll have to wait until next year then, I guess.

01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:10.400
Wouldn't that be a dream?

01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:14.720
Anyways, people are up in arms because GameTap's removing games.

01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:16.320
No.

01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:20.640
Some games you will not be able to play on GameTap anymore include Arthur's First Grade,

01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:22.720
Bionic Bunny's Good Deeds Contest.

01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:27.480
Okay, now hold the fuck up because there are actually some good games on that list, Loki.

01:10:27.480 --> 01:10:31.760
Stop being such a dick.

01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:34.840
I think one of the Civilization games is on there.

01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:37.320
No.

01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:38.560
I know there's games on there.

01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:40.320
Impossible Mission was on there.

01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:41.960
Oh, Impossible Mission.

01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:43.360
Oh, my mistake.

01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:44.360
That game's cool.

01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:45.360
Just shut your mouth.

01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:48.480
Anyways, yes, such wonderful games as Chip's Challenge.

01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:52.360
Does anyone remember that from Windows 3.1?

01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:53.360
Command & Conquer.

01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:54.360
Okay, that was a pretty good game.

01:10:54.360 --> 01:10:59.960
Command & Conquer Red Alert, Descent, 2, 3, and Free Space.

01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:02.120
Oh, all the Ultima games are going offline.

01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:03.120
Earthworm Jim.

01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:04.120
Ultima's awesome.

01:11:04.120 --> 01:11:05.120
Earthworm Jim 2.

01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:08.120
Earthworm Jim 3D.

01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:09.480
Free Space 2.

01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:11.160
Impossible Mission 2.

01:11:11.160 --> 01:11:12.160
Woo-hoo.

01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:13.160
MDK.

01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:14.520
Pretty good.

01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:15.520
See Jerk.

01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:16.520
Whatever.

01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:19.200
You know, and then other games like Pajama Sam.

01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:21.720
Life is rough when you lose stuff.

01:11:21.720 --> 01:11:22.720
Oh.

01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:23.720
Okay.

01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:31.120
Or Pajama Sam, you are what you eat from your head to your feet.

01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:32.120
Pajama Sam.

01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:34.440
Games to play on any day.

01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:35.440
Alright.

01:11:35.440 --> 01:11:39.520
Obviously, though, it's kind of sad because some of those games, like even you admit MDK

01:11:39.520 --> 01:11:43.800
and some of that stuff is kind of cool, the service is losing, and a lot of people are

01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:45.720
like, oh noes, why is GameTap deleting games?

01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:48.680
But I think the answer is probably just as simple as time's up.

01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:50.560
You know, they probably have these signed agreements.

01:11:50.560 --> 01:11:52.780
Their licensing's up with that, you know.

01:11:52.780 --> 01:11:54.120
This will also make someone sad.

01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:55.680
American Deer Hunting 2000.

01:11:55.680 --> 01:11:56.680
Okay.

01:11:56.680 --> 01:11:59.440
Aren't all the games that are being pulled, like most of them come from one or two different

01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:00.440
companies, right?

01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:03.600
Like EA is one of them, and there's, I think, another one.

01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:08.320
And I think this probably just kind of screams that, hmm, EA is probably going to do their

01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:12.120
own thing, or EA is going to be signing a deal with somebody else soon where they're

01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:13.120
getting more money.

01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:16.840
Like some of the sim games are leaving, like Sim Toons, I didn't even realize there was

01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:27.200
a Sim Toons, Sim Tower, Sim Safari, Sim Park, Sim City 2000, Sim City Classic, Tetris, C.

01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:28.840
There's some good stuff leaving.

01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:29.840
Whatever.

01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:33.640
Seriously, it's like Winter Games.

01:12:33.640 --> 01:12:34.640
Alright.

01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:36.400
Well, we'll see what happens.

01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:37.400
Who knows?

01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:40.520
Maybe they'll be starting their own competing service soon, or maybe it's somebody else.

01:12:40.520 --> 01:12:41.520
Damn it!

01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:42.520
What?

01:12:42.520 --> 01:12:44.720
Putt Putt's One Stop Fun Shop is gone!

01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:48.760
What am I going to play now?

01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:52.960
Also I want to say, it kind of sucks for them because they just had this big brouhaha over

01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:57.600
hooray, we hit our 1,000th game, and now losing these 70 games is going to put them back under

01:12:57.600 --> 01:12:58.600
1,000.

01:12:58.600 --> 01:13:02.080
So I think it would be funny if in January they say, we hit our 1,000th game again!

01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:03.360
They should.

01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:05.840
That would be hilarious.

01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:12.520
Anyhow, let's wrap up part A of our show here.

01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:16.800
We're going to be back in a little bit with part B, but not before we do the Classic Game

01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:22.120
of the Week, because we always like to close off part A of our show by paying respects

01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:29.320
to our elders, and we do that by bringing up the Classic Game of the Week.

01:13:29.320 --> 01:13:35.280
Dark Soccer, did you hear the old shows and hear the games that Loki and myself picked?

01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:37.360
You heard mine, but did you hear what Loki picked?

01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:39.240
Loki did Zombies Ate My Neighbors last week.

01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:41.240
That game is great.

01:13:41.240 --> 01:13:43.240
I was almost going to pick that one.

01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:44.240
Almost!

01:13:44.240 --> 01:13:45.240
I was looking at it.

01:13:45.240 --> 01:13:46.240
Well now he beat you to it.

01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:47.240
So what are you going to do?

01:13:47.240 --> 01:13:48.240
I have another game.

01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:49.240
Alright, well alright.

01:13:49.240 --> 01:13:50.240
Me and five other people played.

01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:54.240
Alright, then let's get into Dark Soccer's Game of the Week.

01:13:54.240 --> 01:14:02.320
The game of the week is Threads of Faith, which was a Playstation RPG, but it was more

01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:06.000
like an adventure-basher-type game in Japan.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:11.840
It was called Do Prism, and you did one of two stories where you either played this sort

01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:20.700
of spoiled brat princess who has magic ability, or you played this guy who was a construct

01:14:20.700 --> 01:14:27.160
and his, you know, big fat axe, and it's really, it actually had pretty good graphics for being

01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:28.160
an old Playstation game.

01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:33.720
It was really simple for how it played, but it was really fun.

01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:37.400
And I actually tried to play, I actually started playing through Do Prism, and then when Threads

01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:42.800
of Faith came out, I had to just go out and get it, so, and I actually found my copy of

01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:45.120
it the other day, which made me think about it.

01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:49.280
It was just a really cool little game, and it had its own pretty good following overseas

01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:57.280
too, to the point where there was a fan version of a sequel called Duo Princess, where you

01:14:57.280 --> 01:15:06.000
play as the Princess Mint and her sister Maya, so it was pretty good.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:15.120
I really just love this game, but, you know, it came out the same time that Vagrant Story,

01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:22.240
Legend of Mana, Chrono Cross, and Parasite II came out, so it sort of fell to the sidelines,

01:15:22.240 --> 01:15:25.080
I guess, but I liked it.

01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:26.080
I thought it was a great game.

01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:28.240
So you're bringing it back for another round by reminding people of it.

01:15:28.240 --> 01:15:32.480
I wanted that more than Chrono Cross, I'll put it that way.

01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:38.960
Yeah, Chrono Cross wasn't that great for me, yeah, but, very cool, alright, so your Game

01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:39.960
of the Week.

01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:43.680
And it's more Squeenix good, or more, it was actually just Squaresoft at the time.

01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:48.680
The Game of the Week, Do Prism, also known as, what was it, Threads of Fate, Threads

01:15:48.680 --> 01:15:49.680
of Fate.

01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:51.640
I did not play this game, but I should.

01:15:51.640 --> 01:15:52.640
You can borrow my copy.

01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:55.560
Because I played some of those other games you mentioned that came out, wasn't that also

01:15:55.560 --> 01:15:59.280
the same time that horrible, horrible Mana game came out on PSP, it wasn't, that was

01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:00.280
Legend of Mana.

01:16:00.280 --> 01:16:01.960
Legend of Mana, oh god, that game was awful.

01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:03.400
I hated Legend of Mana.

01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:09.080
I have the Japanese version of Legend of Mana, and I was like, too much text!

01:16:09.080 --> 01:16:13.560
I read 30 Kanji, I can't read this game.

01:16:13.560 --> 01:16:16.440
Now we're going to take a quick break, and we're going to come back in a little bit with

01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:19.200
