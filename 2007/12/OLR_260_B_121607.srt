2
00:00:19,773 --> 00:00:20,193
[SPEAKER_06]: Temptation Sonata

3
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:52,760
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of like this song.

4
00:00:54,321 --> 00:00:56,642
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe it was even a cage match pick at one time.

5
00:00:57,222 --> 00:01:05,027
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, you may remember that the video featured blatant rip-offs of scenes from Advent Children.

6
00:01:05,687 --> 00:01:12,131
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, apparently Square Enix won a case against them for plagiarism.

7
00:01:12,771 --> 00:01:13,512
[SPEAKER_04]: And to the tune of,

8
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:18,181
[SPEAKER_04]: 16 million won, or $17,400.

9
00:01:18,221 --> 00:01:23,665
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess the won is like pesos, apparently.

10
00:01:26,247 --> 00:01:26,748
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah.

11
00:01:28,369 --> 00:01:29,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well.

12
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:30,591
[SPEAKER_04]: $17,000, that's not bad.

13
00:01:31,511 --> 00:01:32,872
[SPEAKER_06]: But the video was pretty cool.

14
00:01:33,253 --> 00:01:35,034
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I don't know if you saw it.

15
00:01:35,114 --> 00:01:35,895
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen it.

16
00:01:35,975 --> 00:01:38,277
[SPEAKER_01]: She had like two other good songs on the album, too.

17
00:01:38,977 --> 00:01:43,481
[SPEAKER_04]: It was neat because it was, you know, Advent Children, but other than that, it was, you know,

18
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:45,660
[SPEAKER_06]: Operator 11, our bandwidth

19
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:19,433
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

20
00:02:41,752 --> 00:02:46,375
[SPEAKER_06]: Final Fantasy IV is getting a sequel, and this to me is awesome news.

21
00:02:46,475 --> 00:02:51,779
[SPEAKER_06]: I am so happy because Final Fantasy IV is my favorite in the entire Final Fantasy series.

22
00:02:51,879 --> 00:03:01,064
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, say what you will, Final Fantasy VII, rah, rah, rah, Final Fantasy IX, or not IX, Final Fantasy VI, well, something like IX, but Final Fantasy VI, rah, rah, rah, there's always that back and forth.

23
00:03:01,305 --> 00:03:03,166
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a soft spot in my heart for Final Fantasy IV.

24
00:03:03,806 --> 00:03:04,687
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

25
00:03:33,428 --> 00:03:34,829
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

26
00:04:04,505 --> 00:04:07,586
[SPEAKER_06]: I was so angsty when I read this news earlier in the week.

27
00:04:07,646 --> 00:04:08,427
[SPEAKER_06]: I said, you know what?

28
00:04:08,567 --> 00:04:12,228
[SPEAKER_06]: I know what segment I want to have follow this news story when we read it this week.

29
00:04:22,293 --> 00:04:30,036
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, it's the FUs of the week, and Jamie's going to start us off.

30
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:34,661
[SPEAKER_01]: My FU of the week goes towards the doctor that I saw who is not my regular doctor.

31
00:04:35,641 --> 00:04:38,062
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, I'm not an idiot.

32
00:04:38,742 --> 00:04:41,022
[SPEAKER_01]: You can tell me what's freaking wrong.

33
00:04:41,362 --> 00:04:43,503
[SPEAKER_01]: You can tell me what you suspect to be wrong.

34
00:04:44,383 --> 00:04:47,704
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I usually can follow what you're saying.

35
00:04:48,104 --> 00:04:49,704
[SPEAKER_01]: My doctor is great, okay?

36
00:04:50,584 --> 00:04:58,286
[SPEAKER_01]: If ever I remotely suspect anything is wrong or have an idea of what might be the cause, because you know me, I'll research the crap out of everything.

37
00:04:58,786 --> 00:04:59,726
[SPEAKER_01]: He listens to me.

38
00:05:00,385 --> 00:05:28,324
[SPEAKER_01]: and then he actually tests for the stuff that I suggest which is how we found out how to treat chronic fatigue for me so that I could actually not pass out on a daily basis or be hurt or anything what happened is when I was in Alabama and I don't know how I did it but my right hand ring finger the tendon started to catch and I wouldn't be able to lift my finger in the morning unless I massaged it and got blood flowing

39
00:05:29,068 --> 00:05:56,822
[SPEAKER_01]: and it was really inflamed along the tendon that goes down my palm so I went to see this doctor and my regular doctor I guess was out for the holidays or something so you know he tested it and you know I had been icing it and doing all the right stuff but he said okay we're gonna give you a cortisone shot I was like what's actually wrong with it oh it's fine we'll just do the shot and so he didn't tell me anything so I actually I got a cortisone shot in my hand

40
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,881
[SPEAKER_01]: And he wouldn't let me watch it either.

41
00:05:59,941 --> 00:06:00,701
[SPEAKER_01]: It pissed me off.

42
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:04,243
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I actually, I don't have the fear of needles that I used to.

43
00:06:05,143 --> 00:06:07,004
[SPEAKER_01]: I give myself a shot in the leg twice a week.

44
00:06:07,044 --> 00:06:09,125
[SPEAKER_01]: I can stand watching a needle in my hand.

45
00:06:09,685 --> 00:06:14,867
[SPEAKER_01]: So he said he wouldn't do it until I would not watch him put the needle in.

46
00:06:15,207 --> 00:06:17,388
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, dude, I'm not going to pass out.

47
00:06:17,428 --> 00:06:18,949
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, are you squeamish?

48
00:06:19,009 --> 00:06:19,869
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going to pass out?

49
00:06:19,889 --> 00:06:21,690
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, no.

50
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:25,912
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it took me looking up the symptoms myself.

51
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:29,747
[SPEAKER_01]: And then looking up the treatments, I realized that he was treating me for trigger finger.

52
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:35,789
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is funny, because my grandma and I actually just had surgery on that one, like, about a month ago.

53
00:06:35,809 --> 00:06:37,790
[SPEAKER_01]: Runs in the family, right?

54
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:39,571
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not hereditary.

55
00:06:40,011 --> 00:06:40,171
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.

56
00:06:40,411 --> 00:06:47,274
[SPEAKER_01]: Trigger finger has to do with inflammation of the tendons, and that it's slipping out of the tendon sheath that goes over the tendons.

57
00:06:47,294 --> 00:06:48,254
[SPEAKER_06]: Then it's just irony.

58
00:06:48,914 --> 00:06:51,135
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's coincidence.

59
00:06:53,096 --> 00:06:55,137
[SPEAKER_01]: However, I will go ahead and say that...

60
00:06:56,508 --> 00:06:58,229
[SPEAKER_01]: I am having a lot less pain in the hand.

61
00:06:58,289 --> 00:07:00,771
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be another few days before the cortisone takes full effect.

62
00:07:01,231 --> 00:07:02,572
[SPEAKER_01]: And I start physical therapy next week.

63
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:05,094
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, you know, fun, but not.

64
00:07:05,974 --> 00:07:13,880
[SPEAKER_01]: So, FU to doctors who do not communicate with their patients.

65
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,081
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

66
00:07:15,421 --> 00:07:17,002
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to go back and see my regular doctor.

67
00:07:17,402 --> 00:07:17,882
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's move on.

68
00:07:17,922 --> 00:07:18,703
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, your FU.

69
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:26,208
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, my FU of the week, not a big surprise, to EBGA for giving me a card that's

70
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:55,998
[SPEAKER_04]: Dead on Arrival and for the other thing also for the card being a gimp version of the normal card that should have been or the motherboard being a gimp version of that with no possible way for me to know what's going wrong when there is something going wrong so now I just have to kind of guess it'll be the last time I buy a motherboard from them and it'll probably be the last time I buy a motherboard from Newegg as well because they apparently are pawning off crap that's gimp versions of the real thing so that sucks

71
00:07:57,042 --> 00:07:58,023
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll buy from Fry's.

72
00:07:58,043 --> 00:08:05,547
[SPEAKER_04]: So that way if it sucks and it's not working, I can take it right back the next day or the same day instead of having to do this whole arming process.

73
00:08:07,808 --> 00:08:08,608
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, is that it?

74
00:08:09,149 --> 00:08:09,509
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

75
00:08:09,849 --> 00:08:11,670
[SPEAKER_06]: My FU of the week goes to Mondays.

76
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:13,171
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll keep it short.

77
00:08:13,231 --> 00:08:14,591
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate Mondays as do we all.

78
00:08:14,631 --> 00:08:19,954
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, Jamie, when you get that controlling time thing figured out, can you figure out a way to do away with Mondays?

79
00:08:21,475 --> 00:08:23,416
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we should just give Monday a different name.

80
00:08:24,357 --> 00:08:24,917
[SPEAKER_06]: Fun Day!

81
00:08:25,017 --> 00:08:26,498
[SPEAKER_01]: But it would be the same thing.

82
00:08:27,017 --> 00:08:28,398
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I don't like that idea.

83
00:08:29,058 --> 00:08:29,858
[SPEAKER_06]: Some days are horrible.

84
00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:32,179
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so that's it.

85
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:33,179
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my FU of the week.

86
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:36,301
[SPEAKER_06]: Now we can get back into some gaming news, can't we?

87
00:08:36,921 --> 00:08:37,761
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, we can.

88
00:08:40,722 --> 00:08:42,283
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we have some news.

89
00:08:43,887 --> 00:08:55,099
[SPEAKER_01]: For our friends who are interested in GameTap, we will be having Street Fighter 3 Third Strike as of December 20th.

90
00:08:55,539 --> 00:09:00,304
[SPEAKER_01]: No online play, but it's Street Fighter 3 Third Strike.

91
00:09:01,686 --> 00:09:02,827
[SPEAKER_01]: So hey, that's good.

92
00:09:05,014 --> 00:09:14,020
[SPEAKER_01]: And on top of that, if you've got the Capcom joystick, I think they actually do have some compatibility with it through GameTap.

93
00:09:14,941 --> 00:09:16,842
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been a long time since I've used that service.

94
00:09:16,983 --> 00:09:21,025
[SPEAKER_06]: I was kind of sad about the games leaving, and I guess they did some client upgrade.

95
00:09:21,045 --> 00:09:22,066
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't even checked it out yet.

96
00:09:23,447 --> 00:09:27,690
[SPEAKER_06]: If I'm not playing it enough, I ought to just cancel the darn thing, but there's still a lot about it I like.

97
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:28,431
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

98
00:09:30,832 --> 00:09:31,773
[SPEAKER_06]: Moving on with more news.

99
00:09:32,834 --> 00:09:33,014
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

100
00:09:34,376 --> 00:09:40,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, so, I don't know, this isn't really a big surprise for me, but Mass Effect is selling very well.

101
00:09:40,781 --> 00:09:42,783
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, they've sold millions.

102
00:09:43,563 --> 00:09:51,890
[SPEAKER_04]: And over the three weeks since launch, they have sold over one million units globally.

103
00:09:52,891 --> 00:09:55,893
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, that should be pretty good, I guess.

104
00:09:55,913 --> 00:09:58,295
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, it's a good game.

105
00:09:58,595 --> 00:10:00,576
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to sell a million copies of anything.

106
00:10:00,616 --> 00:10:02,878
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that would be pretty good for business, I would think.

107
00:10:03,699 --> 00:10:03,819
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

108
00:10:04,378 --> 00:10:05,559
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, millions of copies.

109
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:10,583
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet a lot of people would like certain other games to sell a million copies worldwide.

110
00:10:10,623 --> 00:10:11,544
[SPEAKER_06]: Like the Eye of Judgment?

111
00:10:12,765 --> 00:10:13,046
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe.

112
00:10:13,306 --> 00:10:13,546
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe.

113
00:10:14,073 --> 00:10:15,214
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

114
00:10:43,359 --> 00:10:43,960
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

115
00:11:13,581 --> 00:11:14,422
[SPEAKER_06]: Assassin's Creed has sold a bunch.

116
00:11:37,307 --> 00:11:44,509
[SPEAKER_01]: They have sold 2.5 million copies globally and they've sold a whole bunch more than they thought it would.

117
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:49,891
[SPEAKER_01]: They are hoping to reach 5 million by March 08.

118
00:11:51,032 --> 00:11:52,632
[SPEAKER_06]: And I still have yet to play the damn game.

119
00:11:53,052 --> 00:11:53,933
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I have it.

120
00:11:53,973 --> 00:11:55,093
[SPEAKER_01]: You can probably borrow mine.

121
00:11:56,621 --> 00:11:56,881
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

122
00:11:56,901 --> 00:12:04,108
[SPEAKER_06]: I kind of want to play it before our year-end show, because I hear a lot of people saying it's a great game and deserves to be on year-end's best list.

123
00:12:04,148 --> 00:12:07,210
[SPEAKER_06]: So it won't make mine, though, if I don't ever get a chance to play it.

124
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:09,072
[SPEAKER_06]: So I may take you up on that, Jamie.

125
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:11,714
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you play Assassin's Creed, Loki?

126
00:12:11,874 --> 00:12:13,556
[SPEAKER_06]: You talked about it.

127
00:12:13,576 --> 00:12:14,617
[SPEAKER_06]: But you didn't like it, right?

128
00:12:14,977 --> 00:12:15,237
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

129
00:12:15,377 --> 00:12:16,298
[SPEAKER_06]: What was your problem with it?

130
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,560
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

131
00:12:20,422 --> 00:12:22,043
[SPEAKER_04]: I just didn't like how intricate it was.

132
00:12:22,584 --> 00:12:22,744
[SPEAKER_04]: The...

133
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Control Scheme for it.

134
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:25,281
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't care for it.

135
00:12:25,361 --> 00:12:27,002
[SPEAKER_04]: I just really didn't get to play it much.

136
00:12:28,342 --> 00:12:31,163
[SPEAKER_04]: The thing was, it didn't really hook me, I guess.

137
00:12:31,543 --> 00:12:34,985
[SPEAKER_04]: I played it for a few minutes, and I was like, eh, I don't really want to give this any more time.

138
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:37,466
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so I didn't.

139
00:12:40,147 --> 00:12:52,372
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, so there's some interesting news coming out from the company Gearbox, and of course they have done stuff on

140
00:12:53,052 --> 00:13:22,761
[SPEAKER_04]: like the brand new Brothers in Arms series Hell's Highway actually one of the titles that keeps getting pushed back so one thing that they're looking for to for some inspiration is actually the game Portal because most of their games I think in the past have been pretty linear they like the way that Portal kind of the whole story layout and stuff like that so hopefully in the future we'll see some more kind of futuristic games from Gearbox so that's pretty cool

141
00:13:23,956 --> 00:13:25,397
[SPEAKER_06]: Now you're a big fan of Portal, Jamie.

142
00:13:25,917 --> 00:13:26,537
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I am.

143
00:13:26,857 --> 00:13:30,599
[SPEAKER_06]: And do you believe that more games should take inspiration from Portal?

144
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:33,020
[SPEAKER_01]: I think so.

145
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:48,707
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, because honestly what they're doing is taking... I actually have to say, because also listening to some of the commentary in the game, I think it was pretty cool that they were taking different concepts in physics and trying to incorporate them into the gameplay in a completely different way.

146
00:13:48,847 --> 00:13:49,567
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, changing...

147
00:13:50,646 --> 00:14:00,014
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of having puzzle here, you don't necessarily think in height and width and depth.

148
00:14:00,094 --> 00:14:05,679
[SPEAKER_01]: You think in terms of manipulating that space to your own ends, and I think that that's pretty cool.

149
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:12,625
[SPEAKER_01]: And it completely offers a completely different range of freedom, I think, as far as how they can design a game.

150
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:14,220
[SPEAKER_06]: Very cool.

151
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,101
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to have to listen to that commentary stuff sometime.

152
00:14:16,161 --> 00:14:18,042
[SPEAKER_06]: I think more games should have commentary tracks on it.

153
00:14:18,062 --> 00:14:19,422
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's a pretty interesting idea.

154
00:14:19,802 --> 00:14:22,303
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's hard to have a commentary track in the game.

155
00:14:22,343 --> 00:14:28,085
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the way that Portal kind of did it, where you just kind of go up to something and then kind of play the game from there.

156
00:14:28,846 --> 00:14:35,788
[SPEAKER_01]: It had like a little chat box over it that you could highlight with your gun, and then it would play.

157
00:14:36,949 --> 00:14:40,270
[SPEAKER_01]: And it actually gave you a meter bar so you could see how far through the commentary you were and you could pause it.

158
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:40,770
[SPEAKER_06]: Huh.

159
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:41,691
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty cool.

160
00:14:42,151 --> 00:14:42,491
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

161
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:44,342
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

162
00:14:50,911 --> 00:14:52,852
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a plush companion cube.

163
00:14:52,912 --> 00:14:53,353
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

164
00:14:53,453 --> 00:15:02,079
[SPEAKER_06]: There is officially... Now, you may have seen this, that there was a lot of fan-made, weighted companion cubes being made, and there was a lot of fan stuff.

165
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:08,883
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Valve actually decided to put their own version out, because I'm sure they're seeing what other people are doing, and they're like, hey, we need to get a piece of that.

166
00:15:09,183 --> 00:15:15,648
[SPEAKER_06]: So they put out official weighted companion cube plushies, and in less than 24 hours, the damn thing sold out.

167
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:17,269
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how popular these things are.

168
00:15:17,529 --> 00:15:19,229
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually seeing if they still have the fuzzy dice.

169
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:24,411
[SPEAKER_06]: They went on sale at 4 o'clock on Friday and sold out by noon on Saturday.

170
00:15:24,831 --> 00:15:25,551
[SPEAKER_06]: That's crazy.

171
00:15:26,011 --> 00:15:27,051
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess they'll have to make more.

172
00:15:27,511 --> 00:15:28,412
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want the fuzzy dice.

173
00:15:28,652 --> 00:15:30,132
[SPEAKER_06]: These could be more popular than the Wii.

174
00:15:30,912 --> 00:15:31,812
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want the fuzzy dice.

175
00:15:31,932 --> 00:15:32,713
[SPEAKER_06]: You just want the fuzzy dice?

176
00:15:32,913 --> 00:15:34,213
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you actually going to hang them in your car?

177
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:37,074
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I will because my Pac-Man dice are highly faded now.

178
00:15:37,254 --> 00:15:37,714
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's too bad.

179
00:15:37,734 --> 00:15:39,354
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, then your waiting companion cubes will fade.

180
00:15:39,634 --> 00:15:41,195
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll burn up just like they do in the game.

181
00:15:42,235 --> 00:15:42,915
[SPEAKER_06]: Spoiler!

182
00:15:43,015 --> 00:15:43,475
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, my bad.

183
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,196
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?

184
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:46,516
[SPEAKER_01]: Dan was really funny about that part.

185
00:15:46,776 --> 00:15:47,076
[SPEAKER_06]: How so?

186
00:15:47,817 --> 00:15:59,599
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, as what I mentioned to you earlier, Dan's like, yeah, it's very obvious that the character you're playing is female, because they expect you to get all sappy and, you know, all sobby over your weighted companion cube being dead.

187
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:00,900
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a cube!

188
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,280
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, you don't get it.

189
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:09,762
[SPEAKER_06]: You can also tell your main character's a woman, because in the very beginning of the game, there's like a mirror, and you see that your character has boobs!

190
00:16:10,122 --> 00:16:10,822
[SPEAKER_06]: OMG boobs!

191
00:16:11,122 --> 00:16:11,642
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, he was...

192
00:16:12,651 --> 00:16:13,071
[SPEAKER_01]: and DarkSakura.

193
00:16:41,769 --> 00:16:44,290
[SPEAKER_06]: TheKingOfPortal11 What the hell is wrong with you people?

194
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:46,351
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the cocaine.

195
00:16:47,011 --> 00:16:47,251
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently.

196
00:16:47,271 --> 00:16:48,131
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot of cocaine.

197
00:16:48,151 --> 00:16:49,732
[SPEAKER_06]: Have we been giving out cocaine in chat?

198
00:16:50,552 --> 00:16:51,232
[SPEAKER_01]: Share, please.

199
00:16:51,732 --> 00:16:52,292
[SPEAKER_01]: No kidding.

200
00:16:55,413 --> 00:16:58,815
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well, moving on to other gaming news, then.

201
00:16:59,915 --> 00:17:00,495
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't wanna.

202
00:17:00,795 --> 00:17:01,275
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to.

203
00:17:01,796 --> 00:17:03,376
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

204
00:17:05,217 --> 00:17:08,758
[SPEAKER_01]: Lost Odyssey is supposed to...

205
00:17:10,737 --> 00:17:17,801
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually going to be out on Xbox 360 as an exclusive RPG, and it has a release date of February 12th.

206
00:17:18,742 --> 00:17:20,783
[SPEAKER_01]: And downloadable content will be on its way.

207
00:17:20,803 --> 00:17:27,447
[SPEAKER_06]: Aren't I supposed to be able to get downloadable content for free if I pre-order or something?

208
00:17:27,887 --> 00:17:28,868
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought I read something about that.

209
00:17:29,588 --> 00:17:35,272
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually saying that downloadable content will be made exclusive to anyone who pre-orders.

210
00:17:35,985 --> 00:17:43,270
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, so I don't get free download content, I just get to... I get to pay more to have the download content if I pre-order.

211
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:44,491
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay, that would make more sense.

212
00:17:44,551 --> 00:17:45,671
[SPEAKER_06]: I would hope so.

213
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:48,173
[SPEAKER_06]: They can use the codes and stuff, right?

214
00:17:48,593 --> 00:17:49,834
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they'll give you codes.

215
00:17:49,854 --> 00:17:52,055
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I would think.

216
00:17:53,556 --> 00:17:55,257
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you've heard much about this game yet.

217
00:17:55,438 --> 00:17:56,918
[SPEAKER_04]: It didn't get very highly...

218
00:17:58,386 --> 00:18:01,127
[SPEAKER_04]: The reviews weren't that great on it in Japan.

219
00:18:01,167 --> 00:18:03,787
[SPEAKER_04]: The trailer looked really good.

220
00:18:03,807 --> 00:18:04,127
[SPEAKER_06]: It did.

221
00:18:04,187 --> 00:18:07,888
[SPEAKER_06]: But then I heard it did not get very well received over in Japan.

222
00:18:08,028 --> 00:18:09,748
[SPEAKER_06]: So that makes me a little less excited about it.

223
00:18:10,309 --> 00:18:14,549
[SPEAKER_04]: What's interesting though, which people might not know, is it's on four DVDs.

224
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:17,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like Blue Dragon was on three.

225
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:17,970
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

226
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:20,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Go DVDs!

227
00:18:20,671 --> 00:18:21,131
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay!

228
00:18:21,171 --> 00:18:22,751
[SPEAKER_04]: Can't fit all that space on there.

229
00:18:22,771 --> 00:18:23,871
[SPEAKER_04]: So sad.

230
00:18:23,951 --> 00:18:25,132
[SPEAKER_06]: This game must be epic.

231
00:18:25,912 --> 00:18:26,652
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very epic.

232
00:18:27,277 --> 00:18:31,540
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, sadly enough, I don't know what the game looked like, and that's not really a good point for it.

233
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:36,563
[SPEAKER_04]: It kind of reminds me a little bit of... Oh, God, what is that game now?

234
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:39,305
[SPEAKER_04]: I just had the name.

235
00:18:39,845 --> 00:18:41,766
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, you bought it.

236
00:18:42,507 --> 00:18:44,408
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, not Phantasy Star.

237
00:18:45,229 --> 00:18:45,529
[SPEAKER_06]: 99 Nights?

238
00:18:45,589 --> 00:18:46,389
[SPEAKER_04]: Not 99 Nights.

239
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:48,131
[SPEAKER_04]: Enchanted Arms.

240
00:18:48,691 --> 00:18:49,171
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

241
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,253
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's not a good thing to be compared to.

242
00:18:51,733 --> 00:18:53,954
[SPEAKER_06]: Enchanted Arms wasn't horrible, it just wasn't great.

243
00:18:56,296 --> 00:18:56,556
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

244
00:18:57,310 --> 00:19:00,891
[SPEAKER_04]: Mega Man Battle Network again, yay!

245
00:19:25,566 --> 00:19:26,546
[SPEAKER_06]: How about Mega Man Legends 3?

246
00:19:27,067 --> 00:19:29,207
[SPEAKER_06]: Haven't you guys been hankering for some of that for a while?

247
00:19:30,768 --> 00:19:31,448
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck yeah.

248
00:19:32,008 --> 00:19:33,628
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, they're never going to give that to us.

249
00:19:35,069 --> 00:19:39,830
[SPEAKER_04]: Some theories might be that Mega Man is going to be announced as an official character in Super Smash Bros.

250
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:45,671
[SPEAKER_04]: Brawl, which I would think that would be covered on the daily updates on their stupid website.

251
00:19:45,711 --> 00:19:48,332
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they would have done it already, if that was true.

252
00:19:50,073 --> 00:19:51,313
[SPEAKER_04]: I was seeing right now

253
00:19:52,799 --> 00:20:02,526
[SPEAKER_04]: If there's any sort of update here, other than, well, Reina just says... I guess, four hours and four minutes?

254
00:20:03,227 --> 00:20:04,488
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't read Japanese, dammit!

255
00:20:04,888 --> 00:20:12,354
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's 0404, so either I got the wrong page... Which is entirely possible.

256
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:14,756
[SPEAKER_04]: Happy birthday, Rockman.

257
00:20:15,296 --> 00:20:16,317
[SPEAKER_04]: Still looking like a chick.

258
00:20:16,957 --> 00:20:17,157
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

259
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:24,535
[SPEAKER_06]: Ross Steel UT in response to the whole Mega Man Legends 3.

260
00:20:25,315 --> 00:20:26,716
[SPEAKER_06]: Sky, Capcom can't do that.

261
00:20:26,836 --> 00:20:28,357
[SPEAKER_06]: That'd make Mega Man relevant again.

262
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:30,639
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess that's true.

263
00:20:31,099 --> 00:20:32,861
[SPEAKER_06]: Jamie made a face at that comment.

264
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:34,562
[SPEAKER_06]: What was that face about?

265
00:20:34,602 --> 00:20:35,203
[SPEAKER_06]: You made a face.

266
00:20:35,383 --> 00:20:36,243
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just a face.

267
00:20:36,824 --> 00:20:37,104
[SPEAKER_06]: I see.

268
00:20:37,604 --> 00:20:40,086
[SPEAKER_06]: It was an angry face or it was a grr face.

269
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:42,148
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a face.

270
00:20:42,188 --> 00:20:42,468
[SPEAKER_06]: I see.

271
00:20:43,829 --> 00:20:44,089
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

272
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:45,130
[SPEAKER_06]: Well,

273
00:20:45,845 --> 00:20:47,946
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I know this news ought to make Jamie happy.

274
00:20:48,126 --> 00:20:50,927
[SPEAKER_06]: This is something that will make Jamie very happy for Christmas.

275
00:20:50,967 --> 00:20:51,428
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't know.

276
00:20:51,468 --> 00:20:51,868
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe not.

277
00:20:52,788 --> 00:20:53,869
[SPEAKER_06]: Christmas nights.

278
00:20:54,569 --> 00:21:00,532
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, Jamie always talks about her annual tradition of putting the Saturn back up and playing some Christmas nights every year.

279
00:21:00,832 --> 00:21:08,596
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, maybe she won't have to anymore because it is going to be included in the PlayStation 2 remake of Nights into Dreams for the PlayStation 2.

280
00:21:09,716 --> 00:21:11,317
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to have Christmas nights as well.

281
00:21:11,938 --> 00:21:15,340
[SPEAKER_06]: The bad news for Jamie, it's a Japan-only release, so she's going to have to pay more money to import it.

282
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,181
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, that's a bad thing at all.

283
00:21:17,241 --> 00:21:18,462
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a Japanese PlayStation 2.

284
00:21:18,502 --> 00:21:21,404
[SPEAKER_04]: I do have to admit, remember they said they weren't really remaking the game?

285
00:21:21,784 --> 00:21:23,425
[SPEAKER_04]: The graphics do look a little bit sharper.

286
00:21:24,326 --> 00:21:27,228
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they probably went back and upgraded some things and cleaned some things up.

287
00:21:27,788 --> 00:21:31,831
[SPEAKER_01]: To also make another point, the Saturn did not have nearly the 3D capability...

288
00:21:32,561 --> 00:21:34,502
[SPEAKER_01]: that the PlayStation did.

289
00:21:34,962 --> 00:21:40,223
[SPEAKER_01]: And so being on the PlayStation 2, one would think that it has a better 3D processor than the Saturn would.

290
00:21:40,943 --> 00:21:43,724
[SPEAKER_01]: So it would have to be cleaner textures and that type of thing.

291
00:21:43,764 --> 00:21:51,726
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but true, but then you also forget the fact that people like to slack off when they port games over and they'll just port them exactly the same for authentic purposes, you know.

292
00:21:52,846 --> 00:22:00,068
[SPEAKER_01]: I think even so, even if it was ported over just the same, it still has better, it'd be better capable of processing it, but.

293
00:22:00,549 --> 00:22:12,815
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, Jamie, it's not going to be as simple, unfortunately, as paying all the money to import the game, because not only are you going to have to do that, but then you have to beat Nights into Dreams, and then you will unlock Christmas Dreams.

294
00:22:12,835 --> 00:22:13,735
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me how that's hard.

295
00:22:16,017 --> 00:22:18,058
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just saying, you've got to put a little bit of work into it.

296
00:22:18,618 --> 00:22:20,699
[SPEAKER_06]: You might have to lift a finger, Jamie, to get to Christmas Dreams.

297
00:22:20,719 --> 00:22:23,680
[SPEAKER_01]: You know the hardest thing about that is going to be playing without getting motion sick.

298
00:22:24,701 --> 00:22:27,302
[SPEAKER_01]: Because Nights is another one of those games that makes me motion sick.

299
00:22:28,182 --> 00:22:28,903
[SPEAKER_01]: I got really sick...

300
00:22:29,824 --> 00:22:30,925
[SPEAKER_01]: I was playing Portal earlier.

301
00:22:34,066 --> 00:22:36,008
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, Portal, write cake, attorney.

302
00:22:36,208 --> 00:22:38,069
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, no more Portal jokes!

303
00:22:38,249 --> 00:22:38,889
[SPEAKER_06]: Jesus!

304
00:22:39,069 --> 00:22:40,150
[SPEAKER_06]: They are still going.

305
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:41,651
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.

306
00:22:42,431 --> 00:22:43,032
[SPEAKER_01]: Shut up!

307
00:22:44,032 --> 00:22:46,574
[SPEAKER_04]: Portal, write cake, attorney.

308
00:22:46,854 --> 00:22:49,035
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm leaving chat, so I don't have to read any more of that.

309
00:22:49,996 --> 00:22:50,376
[SPEAKER_06]: Lordy.

310
00:22:50,776 --> 00:22:55,119
[SPEAKER_06]: Chatroom, you're banned from commenting on our program for a little bit until you can calm down with the Portal stuff.

311
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:56,079
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

312
00:22:56,459 --> 00:22:57,240
[SPEAKER_01]: Portal combat.

313
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:57,840
[SPEAKER_06]: If they can behave...

314
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:03,901
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, we'll see if they can behave during our next segment, the weekly mailbag segment.

315
00:23:04,361 --> 00:23:10,622
[SPEAKER_06]: Every week you send in your emails to mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com and we pick a few of our favorites to read right here on the air.

316
00:23:11,282 --> 00:23:17,664
[SPEAKER_06]: And Jamie will read them and we'll compliment you or we'll make fun of you or we'll answer your question or we'll sing a song and dance.

317
00:23:17,704 --> 00:23:19,684
[SPEAKER_06]: Who knows, it's unpredictable, it's the mailbag segment.

318
00:23:20,704 --> 00:23:23,025
[SPEAKER_06]: Jamie, open up ye olde mailbag.

319
00:23:23,516 --> 00:23:24,537
[SPEAKER_06]: and tell us what's in it this week.

320
00:23:24,777 --> 00:23:28,639
[SPEAKER_01]: I will be doing neither song nor dance just to make a point of order.

321
00:23:28,939 --> 00:23:31,140
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you'd like to, you can dance to the song playing in the background.

322
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,361
[SPEAKER_06]: Those of you playing along at home.

323
00:23:33,282 --> 00:23:33,782
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you can't.

324
00:23:34,402 --> 00:23:35,403
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll pop my head.

325
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:37,484
[SPEAKER_01]: First email!

326
00:23:39,725 --> 00:23:42,627
[SPEAKER_01]: From Riz, I guess is how it's pronounced.

327
00:23:43,267 --> 00:23:44,568
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi Rob, Jamie, and Matt.

328
00:23:44,908 --> 00:23:48,910
[SPEAKER_01]: This email was constructed for a number of reasons which are detailed below.

329
00:23:49,491 --> 00:23:52,633
[SPEAKER_01]: I would first like to say what a pleasure listening to your podcast has been.

330
00:23:52,753 --> 00:23:53,233
[SPEAKER_01]: All thank you.

331
00:23:53,806 --> 00:24:01,073
[SPEAKER_01]: I have enjoyed OR since around March and have been greatly entertained by your mix of news, banter, and general chaos.

332
00:24:01,613 --> 00:24:06,638
[SPEAKER_01]: I have been visually impaired since birth, but was able to play a number of video games when I was younger.

333
00:24:06,678 --> 00:24:12,263
[SPEAKER_01]: Due to a deterioration in my eyesight over the years, the number of games I can play is now greatly reduced.

334
00:24:12,893 --> 00:24:13,714
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for watching!

335
00:24:34,572 --> 00:24:41,614
[SPEAKER_06]: I find that most companies and stuff generally don't care if you use video game music and stuff.

336
00:24:42,054 --> 00:24:43,315
[SPEAKER_06]: It's promotion for them.

337
00:24:44,295 --> 00:24:44,955
[SPEAKER_06]: What do they care?

338
00:24:45,575 --> 00:24:52,197
[SPEAKER_06]: And I believe there's some type of fair use law out there or something that as long as you limit it to 30 seconds, you're fine.

339
00:24:52,597 --> 00:24:54,058
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody can really sue you over it.

340
00:24:54,358 --> 00:24:57,659
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, sure, the polite thing to do is ask and all that stuff, but

341
00:24:58,086 --> 00:25:04,788
[SPEAKER_06]: I think as long as you use, especially the old stuff, the old 8-bit stuff, which I know a lot of podcasts use for their openings and things, nobody's really going to care.

342
00:25:05,228 --> 00:25:05,808
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's fine.

343
00:25:06,768 --> 00:25:08,329
[SPEAKER_01]: Next email.

344
00:25:09,729 --> 00:25:13,570
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to thank Sky, DarkSakura, and Loki for hosting the best gaming podcast on the internet.

345
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:16,791
[SPEAKER_01]: I just started listening a couple weeks ago and already I'm hooked.

346
00:25:17,271 --> 00:25:20,091
[SPEAKER_01]: I've already been scouring the internet for all the episodes I can download.

347
00:25:20,131 --> 00:25:21,472
[SPEAKER_01]: I listen to them on my PSP.

348
00:25:21,772 --> 00:25:22,072
[SPEAKER_01]: See?

349
00:25:22,785 --> 00:25:23,765
[SPEAKER_01]: More PSP listeners.

350
00:25:23,886 --> 00:25:25,406
[SPEAKER_06]: I said in Part A there were some.

351
00:25:25,546 --> 00:25:26,167
[SPEAKER_06]: They do exist.

352
00:25:26,247 --> 00:25:28,468
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's no better place for gaming news and humor.

353
00:25:28,668 --> 00:25:29,488
[SPEAKER_01]: One quick question, though.

354
00:25:29,608 --> 00:25:31,749
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there anywhere I can download previous episodes?

355
00:25:32,169 --> 00:25:36,351
[SPEAKER_01]: The RSS feed only goes back a few episodes, and there's about 250 more I can't find.

356
00:25:37,211 --> 00:25:39,572
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks and screw Rockman for sucking so much online.

357
00:25:39,712 --> 00:25:40,153
[SPEAKER_01]: PKJr92

358
00:25:41,913 --> 00:25:50,081
[SPEAKER_06]: If you go to olrpsp.com, the parser over there actually goes back a few more episodes, which if you're listening on your PSP, you've probably already done.

359
00:25:50,121 --> 00:25:52,283
[SPEAKER_06]: You can go back about 20 episodes there.

360
00:25:53,384 --> 00:26:01,671
[SPEAKER_06]: Otherwise, we keep – I think some of the websites like Yahoo Podcasts, I want to say, and –

361
00:26:03,382 --> 00:26:04,163
[SPEAKER_01]: What about iTunes?

362
00:26:04,243 --> 00:26:05,324
[SPEAKER_06]: Podcast Alley.

363
00:26:06,545 --> 00:26:10,950
[SPEAKER_06]: The one on iTunes only goes back ten listings, which is about five episodes.

364
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:20,659
[SPEAKER_06]: And the reason for that is to prevent what happened a few years ago to some podcasts is that this new application came out for the Xbox 360 called XB Stream.

365
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:23,442
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's a great idea and a great application.

366
00:26:23,502 --> 00:26:26,365
[SPEAKER_06]: We're actually a default podcast that's on it when you put this thing in.

367
00:26:26,735 --> 00:26:39,583
[SPEAKER_06]: But for the default podcast that were on the very first version of it, what happened is that the program downloaded every single program from the feed, which for people that never cleaned up their feeds meant their server was getting hammered for like 100 downloads of big shows at once.

368
00:26:40,143 --> 00:26:47,108
[SPEAKER_06]: So we keep our feed tidy for that reason, so that if you use a grabber that does something like that where it gets all episodes of a show, you're limited to 10.

369
00:26:47,768 --> 00:26:48,649
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty much the reason we do it.

370
00:26:48,929 --> 00:26:51,790
[SPEAKER_06]: We only do server cleans about once every few months when we need the space.

371
00:26:51,931 --> 00:26:54,212
[SPEAKER_06]: Otherwise, if you want to find shows older than that,

372
00:26:54,682 --> 00:26:56,423
[SPEAKER_06]: Ask around the community, post on the forums.

373
00:26:56,623 --> 00:27:02,285
[SPEAKER_06]: I know there's one person out there that probably has every pre-podcast show we ever did.

374
00:27:02,305 --> 00:27:04,146
[SPEAKER_06]: I know there's at least one person out there that has that.

375
00:27:04,166 --> 00:27:06,367
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even have that, to put it in perspective.

376
00:27:06,407 --> 00:27:07,667
[SPEAKER_01]: I've asked and haven't heard anything.

377
00:27:08,267 --> 00:27:15,610
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a lot, and we might put out some DVDs out there, but we can't do any big releases of it just because of some of the things.

378
00:27:15,931 --> 00:27:21,073
[SPEAKER_06]: We might have to do something kind of like under the table for the fans only because there was some copyright music, so we can't really sell it for profit.

379
00:27:21,953 --> 00:27:24,434
[SPEAKER_06]: But anything's a possibility in the near future, so we'll see.

380
00:27:25,411 --> 00:27:28,013
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also a funny quote on here from Loki.

381
00:27:28,213 --> 00:27:28,473
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

382
00:27:28,953 --> 00:27:30,574
[SPEAKER_01]: Friendship is like peeing on yourself.

383
00:27:30,695 --> 00:27:33,096
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone can see it, but only you get the warm feeling it brings.

384
00:27:34,937 --> 00:27:35,297
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

385
00:27:37,078 --> 00:27:37,279
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

386
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:39,840
[SPEAKER_01]: To Skye.

387
00:27:40,941 --> 00:27:45,524
[SPEAKER_01]: I was wondering why every time G4 is brought up on the show, you moan and groan about how much you hate it.

388
00:27:46,424 --> 00:27:47,185
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate G4.

389
00:27:47,205 --> 00:27:47,745
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate G4.

390
00:27:50,262 --> 00:27:51,883
[SPEAKER_01]: It isn't that bad in my opinion.

391
00:27:51,943 --> 00:27:57,407
[SPEAKER_01]: The shows, such as Attack of the Show being my favorite, X-Play, Cheat, and Ninja Warrior are all awesome.

392
00:27:57,487 --> 00:28:04,732
[SPEAKER_01]: I can understand that a lot of people wish that it were more like it used to be when it was tech TV, but had a more gaming-oriented atmosphere to it.

393
00:28:04,953 --> 00:28:09,316
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell, I'm pissed that they took off icons and replaced it with crap like cheaters and cops.

394
00:28:09,736 --> 00:28:11,257
[SPEAKER_01]: But you shouldn't hate G4 completely.

395
00:28:11,317 --> 00:28:12,538
[SPEAKER_01]: It still has some great shows on it.

396
00:28:12,618 --> 00:28:13,299
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Osfer.

397
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:14,219
[SPEAKER_01]: P.S.

398
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:16,721
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you guys seen the Zero Punctuation gaming reviews?

399
00:28:16,801 --> 00:28:17,582
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a link to the site.

400
00:28:17,742 --> 00:28:19,243
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I have to see this.

401
00:28:20,149 --> 00:28:22,030
[SPEAKER_06]: That's some funny shit if you watch it every week.

402
00:28:42,558 --> 00:28:45,980
[SPEAKER_06]: It's nothing like it could have been with the whole tech TV merge and stuff.

403
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:48,362
[SPEAKER_06]: And it just got too corporate and yucky.

404
00:28:48,402 --> 00:28:50,323
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's owned by E for God's sakes.

405
00:28:50,443 --> 00:28:51,364
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I don't know.

406
00:28:51,444 --> 00:28:57,148
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just everything that's kind of disturbing about corporate media is kind of like embodied in G4.

407
00:28:57,188 --> 00:28:58,789
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's why I just don't like it.

408
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:02,071
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm allowed not to like things.

409
00:29:05,934 --> 00:29:06,374
[SPEAKER_01]: Next email.

410
00:29:07,154 --> 00:29:07,555
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, guys.

411
00:29:07,715 --> 00:29:07,875
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

412
00:29:08,672 --> 00:29:14,076
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you don't normally read FUs from listeners, but I was in a car accident yesterday, and I really wanted to vent somewhere.

413
00:29:14,477 --> 00:29:14,817
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not?

414
00:29:15,578 --> 00:29:23,584
[SPEAKER_01]: To the woman in the Jeep who tried to pass me by going onto the oncoming traffic while I was making a U-turn, a big fat FU.

415
00:29:24,044 --> 00:29:28,208
[SPEAKER_01]: This is on my last day of finals, and I was just about to go home from Davis, and I am pissed off.

416
00:29:28,688 --> 00:29:32,091
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to have to agree with Loki that women drivers in this area can't drive for anything.

417
00:29:32,191 --> 00:29:32,832
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks at me.

418
00:29:32,852 --> 00:29:34,353
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be me.

419
00:29:35,199 --> 00:29:38,621
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, everyone is okay, although my head slammed into the car door during the impact.

420
00:29:39,181 --> 00:29:44,124
[SPEAKER_01]: The only part of this is that since I won't have a car for a while, I'll be able to sit at home and play all the games I want over the break.

421
00:29:44,665 --> 00:29:52,209
[SPEAKER_01]: That being the case, what are your favorite games that came out this holiday season on any console, since I guess I'll be looking for something to pass the time.

422
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:54,991
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep up the awesome show, I need something to keep my spirits up.

423
00:29:55,011 --> 00:29:56,732
[SPEAKER_01]: What an awesome way to start the holidays.

424
00:29:57,352 --> 00:29:58,453
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy Holidays, AZHP.

425
00:29:59,674 --> 00:29:59,874
[SPEAKER_06]: Portal!

426
00:29:59,894 --> 00:30:00,034
[SPEAKER_06]: Portal!

427
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:05,886
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to give it all away because then I'd be basically giving you my favorite games of the year.

428
00:30:07,373 --> 00:30:08,534
[SPEAKER_06]: I will back up what Jamie said.

429
00:30:08,574 --> 00:30:13,056
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Orange Box in general is a very good investment.

430
00:30:13,196 --> 00:30:13,956
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's a thought though.

431
00:30:14,477 --> 00:30:16,638
[SPEAKER_06]: Use this period, this opportunity.

432
00:30:16,658 --> 00:30:19,719
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad you have such a positive attitude about it because it really sucks what happened.

433
00:30:20,039 --> 00:30:21,460
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad you have a good attitude about it.

434
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:25,862
[SPEAKER_06]: Instead of necessarily having to play everything new that comes out, go back and play the shit you missed.

435
00:30:26,202 --> 00:30:30,124
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I bet there's a lot of stuff that you missed towards the end of last year amongst all the cons of madness.

436
00:30:30,164 --> 00:30:31,344
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll give you a great example for me.

437
00:30:31,364 --> 00:30:31,705
[SPEAKER_06]: Final Fantasy XII.

438
00:30:32,945 --> 00:30:41,188
[SPEAKER_06]: I did not get nearly as far in that game as I would have liked to because it was an amazing battle system in the game and I just never really got a chance to just play it the whole way through to completion.

439
00:30:41,228 --> 00:30:44,070
[SPEAKER_06]: That's one of those games I would like to complete one day when there's time.

440
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:50,492
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would encourage you to actually take this opportunity to go revisit the past games and beat stuff you haven't yet that you wanted to.

441
00:30:50,772 --> 00:30:58,996
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go to Deliverance online and download Ragnarok online and play on the server with me and Ranma and join the OLR guild on there.

442
00:30:59,156 --> 00:30:59,596
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, there you go.

443
00:30:59,616 --> 00:31:00,476
[SPEAKER_06]: Join an MMO.

444
00:31:00,496 --> 00:31:01,597
[SPEAKER_06]: That'll suck up all your time.

445
00:31:02,017 --> 00:31:02,497
[SPEAKER_06]: There you have it.

446
00:31:04,338 --> 00:31:08,160
[SPEAKER_06]: The ACHP is actually in chat right now and says, I just finished 12 during finals week.

447
00:31:09,081 --> 00:31:09,361
[SPEAKER_06]: LOL.

448
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:12,943
[SPEAKER_06]: How did you have time to beat a Final Fantasy game during finals?

449
00:31:13,443 --> 00:31:14,684
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you taking, like, home ec?

450
00:31:15,044 --> 00:31:15,705
[SPEAKER_06]: What is up with that?

451
00:31:15,745 --> 00:31:16,505
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, that's amazing.

452
00:31:16,805 --> 00:31:17,886
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, hey, hey, Rob.

453
00:31:17,986 --> 00:31:18,386
[SPEAKER_06]: What, what?

454
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:23,449
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually, one of my finals weeks, I stayed up for three days and played D&D every night.

455
00:31:23,589 --> 00:31:24,210
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, my God.

456
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:25,210
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys are crazy.

457
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:26,551
[SPEAKER_01]: I passed out on the fourth day.

458
00:31:26,651 --> 00:31:28,912
[SPEAKER_01]: I was kept alive by Jolt Cola and Pixie Stix.

459
00:31:29,112 --> 00:31:31,514
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, any recommendations for our listener who's...

460
00:31:33,556 --> 00:31:36,637
[SPEAKER_06]: Handicapped for Winter Break for games to play while they're on Winter Break?

461
00:31:38,738 --> 00:31:42,060
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Call of Duty 4 is pretty good, I guess.

462
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,280
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, actually it is.

463
00:31:44,001 --> 00:31:47,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Halo 3, Super Mario Galaxy.

464
00:31:50,423 --> 00:31:52,324
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, you can play a ton of stuff.

465
00:31:52,344 --> 00:31:53,325
[SPEAKER_04]: There's tons of games out there.

466
00:31:53,945 --> 00:31:55,746
[SPEAKER_04]: Just play something you haven't played yet.

467
00:31:56,646 --> 00:31:57,066
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

468
00:31:57,347 --> 00:31:58,407
[SPEAKER_04]: RPGs, there you go.

469
00:31:58,427 --> 00:31:59,948
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll bring you a Nintendo.

470
00:32:01,107 --> 00:32:02,527
[SPEAKER_01]: and you can play classic stuff.

471
00:32:02,547 --> 00:32:03,528
[SPEAKER_01]: You can play Guardian Legend.

472
00:32:03,628 --> 00:32:03,928
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

473
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:06,948
[SPEAKER_06]: Go back and play every Saturn game you didn't play previously.

474
00:32:07,328 --> 00:32:09,249
[SPEAKER_01]: Dear God, I don't have enough room for that.

475
00:32:10,289 --> 00:32:10,789
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, anyhow.

476
00:32:10,849 --> 00:32:12,249
[SPEAKER_01]: I know what you should do.

477
00:32:12,369 --> 00:32:13,850
[SPEAKER_01]: Find me a copy of Burning Rangers.

478
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:16,310
[SPEAKER_06]: Next email, please.

479
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:19,851
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, Merry early Christmas slash happy holidays.

480
00:32:19,891 --> 00:32:28,433
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if you're doing an episode for the 23rd and I don't think I can listen live on the 16th which as of this writing is today since I have a final exam the next day.

481
00:32:28,653 --> 00:32:29,633
[SPEAKER_01]: Oops, good luck on that.

482
00:32:30,353 --> 00:32:31,695
[SPEAKER_01]: This is from GS68, by the way.

483
00:32:33,077 --> 00:32:35,440
[SPEAKER_06]: Who happens to be in chat, by the way, so I guess he found a way.

484
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:35,741
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

485
00:32:39,634 --> 00:32:40,855
[SPEAKER_01]: Me regarding fellow gamers.

486
00:32:41,295 --> 00:32:55,781
[SPEAKER_01]: On sites like GamePolitics, Facebook, and especially GameSpy, there are gamers who are quick to get angry and defensive about their games whenever Dr. Phil, whose comment on game usage, not games, being a problem was, in my opinion, a step in the right direction.

487
00:32:56,361 --> 00:33:01,603
[SPEAKER_01]: Although many people who commented on the story just saw the name Dr. Phil and immediately thought, oh my god, it's Dr. Phil, he sucks horse.

488
00:33:02,624 --> 00:33:02,704
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh...

489
00:33:03,465 --> 00:33:06,407
[SPEAKER_01]: JT censorship, and school shootings show up.

490
00:33:06,907 --> 00:33:14,371
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I see comments along the lines of, I hope JT gets his ass kicked so hard he goes sterile, and worse, maybe Microsoft will hire a drifter and kill him.

491
00:33:16,172 --> 00:33:23,435
[SPEAKER_01]: It's rather ironic that there are gamers who oppose the idea that video games make people violent-minded and then go on wishing death upon Jackie Poo.

492
00:33:24,056 --> 00:33:27,577
[SPEAKER_01]: I dislike JT as much as the next gamer, especially his reaction to gamers' email.

493
00:33:27,918 --> 00:33:30,539
[SPEAKER_01]: The Flowers for Jack project and its outcome are a prime example.

494
00:33:31,107 --> 00:33:32,489
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

495
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:56,673
[SPEAKER_01]: Those kinds of personal attacks make us gamers look bad in front of people supportive of video game censorship.

496
00:33:57,153 --> 00:34:10,523
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we need to get sent to Bullworth Academy, no, as if we need to get sent to Bullworth Academy, is this kind of defensiveness and immaturity that also led to the creation of the otaku stereotype.

497
00:34:10,963 --> 00:34:14,926
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm a gamer and an anime slash manga fan, so facepalm.

498
00:34:16,658 --> 00:34:20,741
[SPEAKER_01]: and with all of that said, I wish the three of you and any guests also in the studio a great holiday.

499
00:34:20,822 --> 00:34:21,902
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't die in a car fire.

500
00:34:22,343 --> 00:34:23,744
[SPEAKER_01]: Yours truly, GS68.

501
00:34:23,784 --> 00:34:24,765
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll try, thanks.

502
00:34:25,145 --> 00:34:25,566
[SPEAKER_01]: P.S.

503
00:34:25,726 --> 00:34:28,088
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you three going to SAC Anime this January?

504
00:34:28,448 --> 00:34:32,692
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hoping to go and it would be great to see you guys there since I didn't get a chance to go to last summer's SAC Anime.

505
00:34:34,353 --> 00:34:36,194
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh God, I didn't realize there was one in January too.

506
00:34:36,275 --> 00:34:36,775
[SPEAKER_01]: I forgot about it.

507
00:34:36,795 --> 00:34:37,516
[SPEAKER_01]: We should try to do a panel.

508
00:34:37,676 --> 00:34:39,357
[SPEAKER_06]: I gotta get in touch with Jonas about that.

509
00:34:39,657 --> 00:34:40,258
[SPEAKER_06]: We're gonna try and go.

510
00:34:42,214 --> 00:34:43,394
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not at 8 in the morning.

511
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:45,136
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not going again if our panel's at 8 in the morning.

512
00:34:45,156 --> 00:34:46,317
[SPEAKER_06]: But if we can get something better, we'll go.

513
00:34:46,497 --> 00:34:50,680
[SPEAKER_01]: I probably won't cosplay unless it's my Organization 13 costume.

514
00:34:53,242 --> 00:34:54,683
[SPEAKER_01]: Last email.

515
00:34:55,284 --> 00:34:56,285
[SPEAKER_01]: From Cheeseburger.

516
00:34:57,806 --> 00:34:59,047
[SPEAKER_01]: Who signed it with a question mark.

517
00:34:59,407 --> 00:35:00,248
[SPEAKER_06]: I can ask Cheeseburger?

518
00:35:01,108 --> 00:35:01,809
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Cheeseburger.

519
00:35:02,609 --> 00:35:03,530
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, OLR crew.

520
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:08,094
[SPEAKER_01]: I have been listening to your podcast for almost a year and a half now, and I think it's great.

521
00:35:08,454 --> 00:35:09,195
[SPEAKER_01]: You're still with us?

522
00:35:09,255 --> 00:35:09,455
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.

523
00:35:10,416 --> 00:35:13,078
[SPEAKER_01]: I have also listened live and interacted in chat a few times too.

524
00:35:13,118 --> 00:35:19,482
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason for this email is to ask Rob about Civilization 3, which I purchased for my new computer on his recommendation.

525
00:35:19,862 --> 00:35:21,503
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your perspective on that game?

526
00:35:22,043 --> 00:35:27,026
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also chose Russia because I thought I could make nuclear weapons and blow everything up.

527
00:35:27,587 --> 00:35:30,188
[SPEAKER_01]: The only other PC games I have are StarCraft and Black and White 2.

528
00:35:31,029 --> 00:35:35,952
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, Loki's comment about having a washer and dryer so he could now piss himself with joy was hilarious.

529
00:35:36,593 --> 00:35:40,016
[SPEAKER_01]: Another email comment, Olive Garden Home of the Neverending Salads was funny too.

530
00:35:40,637 --> 00:35:40,917
[SPEAKER_01]: P.S.

531
00:35:41,057 --> 00:35:43,840
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Rob is rad and Kmart sucks lols.

532
00:35:44,981 --> 00:35:46,222
[SPEAKER_06]: I think cheeseburgers are rad.

533
00:35:46,741 --> 00:35:47,962
[SPEAKER_01]: I like cheeseburgers in paradise.

534
00:36:12,611 --> 00:36:14,552
[SPEAKER_06]: But, of course, there are multiple ways to win the game.

535
00:36:14,792 --> 00:36:19,935
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you get the most points for being the first person in space, but that's not nearly as fun as Global Dominantization.

536
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:27,079
[SPEAKER_06]: My favorite thing to do in Civilization is I like to treat everybody really nice, and, you know, I'm like, oh, sure, we'll trade with you.

537
00:36:27,139 --> 00:36:28,480
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's sign a peace treaty.

538
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:29,701
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, we love you.

539
00:36:30,141 --> 00:36:36,725
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I will, you know, take a bunch of army units, like, right outside their city, and then I'll, you know, nuke the shit out of them.

540
00:36:37,125 --> 00:36:38,246
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually got one last email.

541
00:36:38,566 --> 00:36:38,966
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, goody.

542
00:36:39,146 --> 00:36:41,868
[SPEAKER_01]: That we got last minute, and I'm going to read it, and

543
00:36:42,778 --> 00:36:47,961
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not signed, so I'm just going to say it's from G. Davis, I guess.

544
00:36:48,061 --> 00:36:48,302
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

545
00:36:49,062 --> 00:36:49,822
[SPEAKER_01]: LOLR.

546
00:36:50,143 --> 00:36:56,547
[SPEAKER_01]: After listening to your guys' and Jamie's thoughts on DDR on last week's show, I cannot help but feel like I need to say I completely agree.

547
00:36:57,167 --> 00:36:59,488
[SPEAKER_01]: DDR hasn't changed drastically since 6th Mix.

548
00:36:59,909 --> 00:37:04,091
[SPEAKER_01]: However, 7th Mix is my favorite mix and will always be Smile Face.

549
00:37:04,151 --> 00:37:09,114
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing that made DDR so much fun to play was the cheesy Dance Mania pop that was in it.

550
00:37:11,204 --> 00:37:19,752
[SPEAKER_01]: After seeing the list of licensed songs in the arcade version of Supernova 2, I have to say that I am not excited for it because a lot of it is shitty mainstream music.

551
00:37:20,093 --> 00:37:22,295
[SPEAKER_01]: Linkin Park and DDR equals WTF.

552
00:37:23,276 --> 00:37:25,358
[SPEAKER_01]: The same goes for the home versions.

553
00:37:25,698 --> 00:37:30,423
[SPEAKER_01]: Most casual gamers end up thinking Guitar Hero is the best rhythm game because it has real songs in it, in quotes.

554
00:37:31,297 --> 00:37:38,743
[SPEAKER_01]: and when they heard that the home version of Supernova 2 had Britney Spears, Gwen Stefani and Justin Timberlake, they said Guitar Hero had good real music.

555
00:37:39,144 --> 00:37:44,208
[SPEAKER_01]: However, they also said that Captain Jack, Cartoon Heroes and most of the other Dance Mania tracks were some of their favorite songs in DDR.

556
00:37:44,769 --> 00:37:48,512
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think this crappy mainstream pop is appealing to anyone except for 12-year-old girls.

557
00:37:49,421 --> 00:37:51,903
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, Rob, what innovations would you put in DDR?

558
00:37:51,943 --> 00:37:54,145
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I've always been curious as to what they are.

559
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:59,129
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my favorite things about DDR is the sheer simplicity of it, so anybody could jump in and play.

560
00:37:59,249 --> 00:38:01,731
[SPEAKER_01]: I think too many changes might ruin that part of DDR.

561
00:38:03,133 --> 00:38:06,576
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I've said this a million times on the show, but I know you might be a newer listener or what have you.

562
00:38:06,596 --> 00:38:08,757
[SPEAKER_06]: We've been doing the show a long time, so it feels like a million.

563
00:38:08,777 --> 00:38:10,659
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think the best way they could innovate DDR...

564
00:38:11,212 --> 00:38:14,894
[SPEAKER_06]: is that right now the way DDR is, it has a lot of cooperative modes in the game.

565
00:38:15,475 --> 00:38:21,098
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of cooperative dancing, a lot of cooperative... I think the way for DDR to innovate is to make it more of a competitive game.

566
00:38:21,379 --> 00:38:23,960
[SPEAKER_06]: And that way tournaments can be based more around the competition element.

567
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:31,525
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, yes, I understand there's Dance Magic in DDR Disney, and I believe there was a mode similar to it in some of the later home versions that they did for DDR.

568
00:38:31,585 --> 00:38:37,369
[SPEAKER_06]: However, these versions have always been like add-ons or tack-ons and not the focus of the game itself.

569
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:43,832
[SPEAKER_06]: and I think there ought to be some type of like dance battle or something that the game could kind of focus on.

570
00:38:44,892 --> 00:38:47,333
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, kind of taking some ideas and innovating from that.

571
00:38:47,513 --> 00:38:51,074
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that maybe even in one player mode you do battle against the computer.

572
00:38:51,395 --> 00:38:58,037
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's how games like Busta Groove worked is that, you know, you were always kind of battling somebody else to see who was the better dancer.

573
00:38:58,317 --> 00:38:59,557
[SPEAKER_01]: And they did it better in the second one.

574
00:38:59,717 --> 00:39:07,380
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and I think that could be a new direction for DDR where they could innovate yet keep the core element of the game stomping on arrows the same.

575
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:09,021
[SPEAKER_01]: Second Mix had it.

576
00:39:10,202 --> 00:39:10,682
[SPEAKER_01]: Dance Battle.

577
00:39:25,034 --> 00:39:30,436
[SPEAKER_06]: Having some of the mainstream stuff is nice, but I think, you know, the Dance Mania stuff is always where it was at.

578
00:39:30,456 --> 00:39:31,317
[SPEAKER_06]: And a different drum, too.

579
00:39:31,397 --> 00:39:31,937
[SPEAKER_06]: Can't forget them.

580
00:39:32,317 --> 00:39:36,899
[SPEAKER_06]: But, boy, I really ruffled some feathers in my comments last week, though, from some of the hardcore DDR people.

581
00:39:36,979 --> 00:39:38,039
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen a few comments.

582
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:40,981
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, I stand by what I said.

583
00:39:41,021 --> 00:39:45,202
[SPEAKER_06]: I know it's tough to hear, but... Super DDR Fighter 2 Turbo.

584
00:39:46,083 --> 00:39:49,964
[SPEAKER_06]: It's time for DDR to innovate or... Eliminate?

585
00:39:50,004 --> 00:39:50,484
[SPEAKER_06]: Go away.

586
00:39:50,764 --> 00:39:51,865
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate to say that, but...

587
00:39:52,691 --> 00:39:54,092
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

588
00:40:18,365 --> 00:40:28,730
[SPEAKER_04]: You will be able to send virtual console games to friends on your friends list, barring that you have their Wii friend code.

589
00:40:29,511 --> 00:40:32,932
[SPEAKER_04]: But you can gift wonderful virtual console games.

590
00:40:33,453 --> 00:40:40,736
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm sure once Guardian Legend comes out, you'll have 30 copies of Guardian Legend coming to you from all your friends.

591
00:40:40,916 --> 00:40:42,177
[SPEAKER_06]: I have no problem with this.

592
00:40:44,574 --> 00:40:46,475
[SPEAKER_04]: No word, though, and I haven't heard about this before.

593
00:40:46,515 --> 00:40:48,115
[SPEAKER_04]: What happens if you already have the game?

594
00:40:48,496 --> 00:40:49,456
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess you're just out of luck.

595
00:40:50,857 --> 00:40:51,277
[SPEAKER_06]: Perhaps.

596
00:40:51,677 --> 00:40:52,057
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

597
00:40:52,657 --> 00:41:02,681
[SPEAKER_06]: Or, well... No, I want to say I have heard that what happens if you already have the game is that you actually can't send the game to your friend.

598
00:41:02,962 --> 00:41:06,983
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, when you try to gift it to them, it'll just bounce back and say you can't gift this because they already have it.

599
00:41:07,383 --> 00:41:08,284
[SPEAKER_06]: Or something along those lines.

600
00:41:08,304 --> 00:41:09,144
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's kind of cool, then.

601
00:41:09,624 --> 00:41:09,884
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

602
00:41:11,065 --> 00:41:13,686
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't guarantee that, though, but I'm pretty sure that's what I read.

603
00:41:14,179 --> 00:41:15,180
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

604
00:41:42,183 --> 00:41:45,405
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're feeling cheap this Christmas, gift free things to your friends.

605
00:41:46,206 --> 00:41:46,586
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fun.

606
00:41:49,208 --> 00:41:49,869
[SPEAKER_01]: I like free.

607
00:41:50,869 --> 00:41:52,731
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you want to watch the Metroid Channel.

608
00:41:53,531 --> 00:41:54,372
[SPEAKER_01]: The Metroid Channel.

609
00:41:55,693 --> 00:41:58,115
[SPEAKER_06]: I would watch the Metroid Channel if that were a real TV channel.

610
00:41:59,196 --> 00:42:05,140
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there is a little bit of news for people who like stuff on their iPhone.

611
00:42:07,422 --> 00:42:09,084
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that like stuff on my cat?

612
00:42:09,524 --> 00:42:09,604
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

613
00:42:11,201 --> 00:42:12,902
[SPEAKER_01]: It's as in emulation.

614
00:42:13,342 --> 00:42:19,024
[SPEAKER_01]: They are in the beta stage, well, near the beta stage, I should say, for an iPhone PS1 emulator.

615
00:42:19,965 --> 00:42:26,888
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's called PSX for number four iPhone emulator.

616
00:42:27,348 --> 00:42:33,471
[SPEAKER_01]: They're still working on it, but hopefully they'll have something out soon for all of you who want to do it.

617
00:42:33,491 --> 00:42:39,754
[SPEAKER_01]: But they say that their goal is to have it 75% compatible with all of the...

618
00:42:42,037 --> 00:42:45,599
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd have to say it's compatible with 75% of the list of PS1 games that are out.

619
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:49,781
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, that'd be nice, but you know what?

620
00:42:49,981 --> 00:42:52,983
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to download it unless something that Apple puts out.

621
00:42:53,984 --> 00:42:57,926
[SPEAKER_06]: Rosto UT in chat says, unless you can plug a controller in the iPhone, do not want...

622
00:42:59,213 --> 00:43:18,989
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking at the screen for this that they have on here, and I'll go ahead and link that in the chat room, they've got D-pads and your trigger buttons on the screen itself sort of running behind the game stuff itself.

623
00:43:19,069 --> 00:43:22,232
[SPEAKER_01]: So that still doesn't... I don't think it's going to work.

624
00:43:22,932 --> 00:43:25,514
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't think that it'll be very playable.

625
00:43:26,595 --> 00:43:27,856
[SPEAKER_01]: The Nintendo one, I understand.

626
00:43:27,916 --> 00:43:28,677
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually was okay.

627
00:43:29,318 --> 00:43:30,219
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo one looks rad.

628
00:43:30,239 --> 00:43:35,183
[SPEAKER_06]: If I had an iPhone, I'd do it, except for the fact that, you know, then Apple will put the curse of death on my phone, probably.

629
00:43:35,203 --> 00:43:36,304
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't want to brick my phone.

630
00:43:36,384 --> 00:43:37,085
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, exactly.

631
00:43:37,105 --> 00:43:39,247
[SPEAKER_04]: You already have the curse of death if you have an iPhone anyway.

632
00:43:39,547 --> 00:43:40,067
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut up.

633
00:43:40,708 --> 00:43:42,069
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't had a single problem with mine.

634
00:43:43,991 --> 00:43:44,531
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, shiz.

635
00:43:44,651 --> 00:43:45,532
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, more news.

636
00:43:45,992 --> 00:43:47,834
[SPEAKER_06]: Less Apple debate, more news.

637
00:43:49,736 --> 00:43:52,318
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, let's see here.

638
00:43:54,259 --> 00:44:01,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, there's gonna be some new maps, apparently, for Team Fortress 2 coming, as well as some more fixes, uh, cause you can't fix that game enough.

639
00:44:02,364 --> 00:44:06,587
[SPEAKER_04]: But, um, that's kinda cool that they're having new maps, cause I remember before, they only had, like, what, three maps?

640
00:44:06,887 --> 00:44:07,528
[SPEAKER_04]: So that kinda sucks.

641
00:44:08,128 --> 00:44:23,458
[SPEAKER_04]: But now, um, let's see here, they're talking about some different, uh, fixes that they're gonna be having, including several gameplay exploits, plus other stuff to improve, uh, bandwidth usage, and, um, improve stats reporting, and I guess some menu bugs.

642
00:44:24,904 --> 00:44:27,865
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't really say, though, what the different levels are going to be yet.

643
00:44:29,146 --> 00:44:32,307
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm sure we'll find that out soon, because I don't think it's officially been announced.

644
00:44:34,588 --> 00:44:36,588
[SPEAKER_06]: What are you freaking out about over there, DarkSakura?

645
00:44:37,389 --> 00:44:41,510
[SPEAKER_01]: I was looking at Valve's website, and they have Aperture Science cups.

646
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:42,771
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do want one.

647
00:44:46,452 --> 00:44:51,114
[SPEAKER_06]: It's funny, because all the passion she had for DDR at one time, she now has for Portal.

648
00:44:51,154 --> 00:44:51,734
[SPEAKER_06]: It's amazing.

649
00:44:52,034 --> 00:44:53,715
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what would be fucking awesome?

650
00:44:53,775 --> 00:44:54,015
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

651
00:44:54,597 --> 00:44:59,322
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know how they have those stupid little, um, you know, light-censored things?

652
00:44:59,762 --> 00:45:03,847
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like the stupid frogs and stuff that you walk in front of and they rib it at you and stuff?

653
00:45:04,167 --> 00:45:08,631
[SPEAKER_04]: They need one of those sentry guns or whatever, so when you walk past it's all, Hello!

654
00:45:09,372 --> 00:45:10,233
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's there?

655
00:45:11,214 --> 00:45:15,819
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and do all that stuff and pop up and... We need to make that happen.

656
00:45:16,119 --> 00:45:16,840
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be pretty sweet.

657
00:45:17,105 --> 00:45:17,766
[SPEAKER_06]: W00T is the word of the year

658
00:45:41,004 --> 00:45:42,725
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think I need to define what Woot means.

659
00:45:42,805 --> 00:45:45,207
[SPEAKER_06]: Most gamers know Woot is like a celebration thing.

660
00:45:45,227 --> 00:45:48,749
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm just thinking, I always think about Woot.com too, the store.

661
00:45:49,049 --> 00:45:49,529
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what they have?

662
00:45:49,569 --> 00:45:53,111
[SPEAKER_06]: This is going to be great business for them to be the guy that owns Woot.com right now.

663
00:45:53,692 --> 00:45:57,194
[SPEAKER_06]: The runner up, by the way, was Facebook, but using it as a verb.

664
00:45:57,254 --> 00:45:58,635
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you're going to Facebook somebody.

665
00:45:59,155 --> 00:46:03,438
[SPEAKER_06]: But I always thought saying you were going to MySpace somebody was a more popular verb to use.

666
00:46:03,738 --> 00:46:04,979
[SPEAKER_01]: I just say friend somebody.

667
00:46:05,279 --> 00:46:05,519
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

668
00:46:05,539 --> 00:46:07,720
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think that's a good thing to say.

669
00:46:08,421 --> 00:46:08,521
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

670
00:46:09,485 --> 00:46:11,106
[SPEAKER_01]: Turn a noun into a verb.

671
00:46:36,981 --> 00:46:38,863
[SPEAKER_04]: We're totally independent, but we're owned by Sony.

672
00:46:39,363 --> 00:46:44,607
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently, LittleBigPlanet and Killzone 2 are not coming out until September or October next year.

673
00:46:45,128 --> 00:46:49,872
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a pretty big difference from early 2008, which was the original time for LittleBigPlanet.

674
00:46:50,132 --> 00:46:54,635
[SPEAKER_06]: But then again, pushback should be no new news to Sony, or really gaming in general.

675
00:46:54,656 --> 00:46:56,517
[SPEAKER_06]: It wouldn't be fair to pick on Sony in that department.

676
00:46:56,817 --> 00:46:58,639
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, Super Smash Bros.

677
00:46:58,699 --> 00:47:00,200
[SPEAKER_06]: Brawl, right?

678
00:47:01,921 --> 00:47:06,205
[SPEAKER_06]: But it just kind of sucks for sales because, again, without really, really killer applications...

679
00:47:07,861 --> 00:47:10,523
[SPEAKER_06]: PlayStation 3's aren't going to move off-shells any faster.

680
00:47:11,063 --> 00:47:32,596
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, no, all the stuff that they're promising us, you know, that was supposed to be coming out so people would buy these systems, you know, I'm sure you've seen the trailers for, like, the third-party stuff that they have for PlayStation 3 now, where they're advertising Metal Gear Solid 4, like, it's out right now, even though it doesn't come out until, what, like, shit, I don't even know, they haven't officially announced it yet, probably, like, March-ish, so...

681
00:47:33,332 --> 00:47:35,273
[SPEAKER_06]: Quick clarifications from our chat room.

682
00:47:35,613 --> 00:47:40,616
[SPEAKER_06]: Ross Steel UT says three speeches, Sony Europe, Sony USA is PlayStation.blog.

683
00:47:41,997 --> 00:47:42,437
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, fine.

684
00:47:43,638 --> 00:47:45,218
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's still Sony, no matter what country you're in.

685
00:47:45,238 --> 00:47:46,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if that's the case, then who knows?

686
00:47:46,358 --> 00:47:51,659
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, LittleBigPlanet and Killzone being delayed to, like, the fall, you know, Europe's always getting the shaft.

687
00:47:51,699 --> 00:47:57,640
[SPEAKER_06]: That's true, Europe always gets the shaft in that department, but I don't know, even... That's a long shaft.

688
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:01,501
[SPEAKER_06]: If they're not getting them until the end of the year, and we're getting them at the beginning of the year.

689
00:48:01,621 --> 00:48:02,801
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, here's the thing I want to know.

690
00:48:03,181 --> 00:48:06,562
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure if SingStar is already out now in Europe.

691
00:48:06,602 --> 00:48:09,142
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it's not here for the PlayStation 3, at least.

692
00:48:09,362 --> 00:48:12,863
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe they're just having trouble with, like, their network infrastructure or something like that, because...

693
00:48:14,038 --> 00:48:23,669
[SPEAKER_04]: Home, SingStar, this little big planet that's going to have a lot of network backend stuff is not coming out.

694
00:48:24,190 --> 00:48:27,794
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it sad that I kind of sort of want a PlayStation 3 for SingStar?

695
00:48:28,956 --> 00:48:32,737
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it is sad, seeing as there's countless versions for the PlayStation 2.

696
00:48:33,377 --> 00:48:34,897
[SPEAKER_04]: Why the fuck do you need the PlayStation 3 version?

697
00:48:34,917 --> 00:48:36,598
[SPEAKER_06]: Because of the whole, like, I know my friends.

698
00:48:36,618 --> 00:48:38,218
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, because you can upload videos to YouTube.

699
00:48:38,238 --> 00:48:39,318
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, and I want to do that to my friends.

700
00:48:39,338 --> 00:48:42,899
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, because we never upload videos to any other site.

701
00:48:43,099 --> 00:48:44,700
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like uploading videos to YouTube.

702
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:45,500
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, how about this?

703
00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:48,421
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't you actually upload videos to YouTube?

704
00:48:48,681 --> 00:48:49,061
[SPEAKER_04]: Guess what?

705
00:48:49,121 --> 00:48:50,341
[SPEAKER_04]: It's free to do that.

706
00:48:51,081 --> 00:48:52,642
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead of having to buy a game.

707
00:48:52,862 --> 00:48:53,922
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, fine, shut up.

708
00:48:56,269 --> 00:48:58,770
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't you buy, you know, fucking SingStar right now?

709
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:00,411
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, hell, you get the microphones.

710
00:49:00,431 --> 00:49:01,652
[SPEAKER_04]: They work with the PlayStation 3.

711
00:49:02,133 --> 00:49:04,374
[SPEAKER_06]: Seprock1215 says, Rob, just play Rock Band.

712
00:49:04,414 --> 00:49:06,395
[SPEAKER_06]: Ironically enough, I was playing Rock Band last night.

713
00:49:06,455 --> 00:49:12,159
[SPEAKER_06]: One of my friends was filming me, and I wouldn't be surprised if that shit ended up on MySpace TV or YouTube or any of that stuff.

714
00:49:12,239 --> 00:49:15,041
[SPEAKER_06]: But I hope not, because I look like an idiot when I play Rock Band.

715
00:49:15,361 --> 00:49:16,242
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially the singing.

716
00:49:16,562 --> 00:49:17,363
[SPEAKER_06]: I was horrible.

717
00:49:18,083 --> 00:49:18,463
[SPEAKER_06]: Horrible.

718
00:49:18,483 --> 00:49:20,004
[SPEAKER_06]: Because none of those songs are in my key.

719
00:49:20,225 --> 00:49:21,005
[SPEAKER_06]: I would just like to share.

720
00:49:22,246 --> 00:49:22,346
[SPEAKER_06]: So.

721
00:49:24,255 --> 00:49:26,216
[SPEAKER_01]: It was hard to play the drums and listen to that.

722
00:49:26,236 --> 00:49:27,017
[SPEAKER_01]: She's fucking hardcore, I love it.

723
00:49:53,502 --> 00:49:54,463
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

724
00:50:23,082 --> 00:50:36,770
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and actually this is sort of, well, it's old news if they're on your, um, DeviantArt friends list, but, um, uh, Udon Crew has been, um, working on, uh, new Street Fighter comics.

725
00:50:37,490 --> 00:50:39,171
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have been for quite some time.

726
00:50:39,251 --> 00:50:46,535
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, in 2008 there's a Street Fighter II Turbo comic that is to be out and I really, really love the work that Udon Crew has done on this.

727
00:50:46,895 --> 00:50:48,716
[SPEAKER_01]: They're also bringing out, though, um,

728
00:50:49,204 --> 00:51:17,720
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of the different comics that are from overseas but they're also doing a Street Fighter Legends one that's different focus comics on different ones they're also doing a one for Street Fighter 3 they're also bringing out some of the other collections that came out overseas like the

729
00:51:18,884 --> 00:51:26,086
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been doing Sakura Ganbaru, which I read a long time ago in scans, but it's pretty cool.

730
00:51:28,526 --> 00:51:28,906
[SPEAKER_06]: Alrighty.

731
00:51:29,386 --> 00:51:30,006
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty cool.

732
00:51:33,587 --> 00:51:41,068
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you can also go on DeviantArt and you can add Udon to your friends list, and I'll get the name in a sec.

733
00:51:41,469 --> 00:51:41,709
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

734
00:51:43,189 --> 00:51:43,669
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see here.

735
00:51:44,375 --> 00:51:47,637
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, there's some interesting news coming out about Grand Theft Auto 4.

736
00:51:48,557 --> 00:51:54,520
[SPEAKER_04]: They've rated it in Australia already, MA15+, which is good for two reasons.

737
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:59,882
[SPEAKER_04]: One, it's not going to be adults only over there at least, and I know a lot of games get banned in Australia.

738
00:52:00,922 --> 00:52:11,467
[SPEAKER_04]: Two, the fact that it's actually been rated, first off, may indicate that it's actually coming out soon, and possibly within the time frame that they had originally said, which was April 1st.

739
00:52:11,849 --> 00:52:21,217
[SPEAKER_04]: Although, the other thing, 3 Speech, I believe, said that Grand Theft Auto 4 was coming out around the same time as Killzone 2 and LittleBigPlanet.

740
00:52:21,297 --> 00:52:22,858
[SPEAKER_04]: So, let's hope that's not true.

741
00:52:23,218 --> 00:52:25,720
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's hope it's actually coming out before holiday 2008.

742
00:52:27,021 --> 00:52:28,563
[SPEAKER_04]: Go spring release, come on.

743
00:52:29,383 --> 00:52:30,304
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to play this game.

744
00:52:32,986 --> 00:52:33,767
[SPEAKER_01]: I found it, by the way.

745
00:52:33,787 --> 00:52:34,047
[SPEAKER_01]: What's that?

746
00:52:34,087 --> 00:52:37,089
[SPEAKER_01]: It's udoncrew.dvnart.com There it is.

747
00:52:37,450 --> 00:52:41,313
[SPEAKER_01]: I find a lot of their art wallets in progress, too.

748
00:52:42,307 --> 00:52:43,809
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll save the last minute stories.

749
00:52:43,850 --> 00:52:45,612
[SPEAKER_06]: That is going to do it for our news tonight.

750
00:52:45,993 --> 00:52:46,934
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know what that means.

751
00:52:46,974 --> 00:52:50,320
[SPEAKER_06]: It's time to open up the telephones and let you guys have a say.

752
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:53,284
[SPEAKER_06]: If you'd like to give us a call, it's 1-877-GAME-OLR.

753
00:52:53,404 --> 00:52:55,708
[SPEAKER_06]: Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

754
00:52:55,748 --> 00:52:57,551
[SPEAKER_06]: We've been doing the Skype thing for a long time.

755
00:52:58,015 --> 00:52:59,376
[SPEAKER_06]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

756
00:53:23,837 --> 00:53:24,978
[SPEAKER_07]: Good, good, good.

757
00:53:25,678 --> 00:53:31,142
[SPEAKER_07]: Last week I went to my final anime con of the year, and I have some gaming stuff for you.

758
00:53:32,043 --> 00:53:32,403
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

759
00:53:32,483 --> 00:53:33,484
[SPEAKER_06]: You got me stuff?

760
00:53:34,705 --> 00:53:36,667
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I mean, just some gaming information.

761
00:53:36,747 --> 00:53:43,732
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not much, because I was working the whole weekend, because my roommate has a company now, so I was helping him peddle his wares.

762
00:53:45,073 --> 00:53:45,513
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool.

763
00:53:45,533 --> 00:53:46,534
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, what kind of stuff?

764
00:53:47,695 --> 00:53:53,239
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, first off, I was talking to a couple of people that were running the gaming room at New York Anime Fest,

765
00:53:53,800 --> 00:54:11,844
[SPEAKER_07]: and things were a little bit different they wanted to be different from normal gaming rooms so there would no be money there this year including no rock band or guitar or guitar hero or anything like that good for them taking a stand because honestly most of the people that go to those cons have all that shit at home don't they?

766
00:54:13,164 --> 00:54:20,486
[SPEAKER_07]: pretty much so there you go they had more like more anime based games and other RPGs and stuff

767
00:54:20,990 --> 00:54:24,872
[SPEAKER_07]: but there was a couple of instances that did happen in the game room from what I was told.

768
00:54:28,133 --> 00:54:36,897
[SPEAKER_07]: A DS got stolen with a game that was in development and some other guy tried to steal another DS but he got caught in doing it.

769
00:54:38,057 --> 00:54:41,398
[SPEAKER_06]: You know that DS game in development is going to be up on the internet any day now.

770
00:54:41,598 --> 00:54:42,819
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably already up there.

771
00:54:43,559 --> 00:54:45,600
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the thing is I don't even know which game it was.

772
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:46,821
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

773
00:54:49,022 --> 00:54:49,422
[SPEAKER_07]: Also,

774
00:54:50,555 --> 00:54:56,278
[SPEAKER_07]: While I was there, I was working for a couple other websites, and one of my friends runs a site called Gaming Angel.

775
00:54:56,358 --> 00:55:01,580
[SPEAKER_07]: So I was running around getting pictures of female cosplayers doing gaming stuff.

776
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:09,123
[SPEAKER_07]: I could tell you the most popular gaming cosplayers were pretty much Yuna from Final Fantasy X and Final Fantasy X-2.

777
00:55:10,544 --> 00:55:11,744
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of not a surprise.

778
00:55:11,784 --> 00:55:15,346
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen a lot of Yunas of all shapes and sizes at anime cons.

779
00:55:16,428 --> 00:55:18,049
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie, this next picture is for you.

780
00:55:18,089 --> 00:55:18,249
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

781
00:55:43,223 --> 00:55:45,004
[SPEAKER_06]: The second picture is a person cosplaying knights.

782
00:55:45,124 --> 00:55:48,966
[SPEAKER_06]: And this next one is a picture of something you probably enjoyed when I sent it to your cell phone.

783
00:55:49,006 --> 00:55:51,328
[SPEAKER_07]: This is my friend dressed up as Pit from Smash Brothers Brawl.

784
00:56:10,614 --> 00:56:14,777
[SPEAKER_06]: I got a random text message from Ranma over the weekend with the lady dressed as Pit.

785
00:56:15,217 --> 00:56:16,038
[SPEAKER_06]: That's hardcore, though.

786
00:56:16,058 --> 00:56:16,578
[SPEAKER_06]: I like that.

787
00:56:17,379 --> 00:56:17,899
[SPEAKER_06]: Good for her.

788
00:56:18,100 --> 00:56:18,900
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope she won something.

789
00:56:20,421 --> 00:56:22,703
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure, but I can always ask because she's a good friend of mine.

790
00:56:23,024 --> 00:56:28,508
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know Jamie is a big fan of Silent Hill, so I found a girl who did Pyramid Head.

791
00:56:29,208 --> 00:56:30,069
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool, yeah.

792
00:56:32,531 --> 00:56:35,874
[SPEAKER_07]: And the last two pictures, I've got to say, are my personal favorites.

793
00:56:37,095 --> 00:56:37,855
[SPEAKER_07]: You like Final Fight?

794
00:56:38,416 --> 00:56:38,636
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.

795
00:56:38,676 --> 00:56:38,836
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

796
00:56:39,338 --> 00:56:41,399
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got like almost every version that they put out at home.

797
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:46,582
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there's this guy walking around with a shirt that says, I got 08 on the front.

798
00:56:48,444 --> 00:56:55,588
[SPEAKER_07]: And on the back, it says, and I quote, a turkey in every oral drum and a fist in every face.

799
00:56:56,048 --> 00:56:56,388
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

800
00:56:57,809 --> 00:56:58,470
[SPEAKER_01]: That was great.

801
00:56:59,610 --> 00:57:00,571
[SPEAKER_06]: That's great.

802
00:57:03,194 --> 00:57:04,535
[SPEAKER_06]: I like how it's just some dude.

803
00:57:04,595 --> 00:57:07,617
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just some dude wearing this shirt like, yeah, I got my Hager 08 shirt.

804
00:57:07,857 --> 00:57:10,258
[SPEAKER_06]: A turkey in every oil drum and a fist in every face.

805
00:57:10,358 --> 00:57:11,239
[SPEAKER_06]: That's amazing.

806
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:14,740
[SPEAKER_06]: I want that shirt.

807
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:15,661
[SPEAKER_06]: He should market that.

808
00:57:16,381 --> 00:57:18,382
[SPEAKER_06]: Some other folks in chat are saying they want that shirt too.

809
00:57:18,543 --> 00:57:19,663
[SPEAKER_01]: That shirt is fantastic.

810
00:57:20,824 --> 00:57:24,146
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, since the pic is outposted, maybe I'll end up hearing from the guy.

811
00:57:24,166 --> 00:57:25,947
[SPEAKER_07]: I could find out more information about the shirt.

812
00:57:25,967 --> 00:57:28,188
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a feeling he made it himself, which is pretty damn cool.

813
00:57:29,790 --> 00:57:38,797
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I was just thinking, you know, at Orange Lounge Radio, we should open a t-shirt shop and not just sell official Orange Lounge Radio t-shirts, like, finally, but really funny gamer nerd shirts, such as that.

814
00:57:38,878 --> 00:57:43,421
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I mean, obviously, we wouldn't steal that idea, but we could come up with other things that are just as funny, right?

815
00:57:43,762 --> 00:57:49,446
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, we should get a shirt that says, Rate Me Pyramid Head on it, and, like, a little, with a little chibi pyramid head on it.

816
00:57:49,586 --> 00:57:51,108
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I'd wear that in public, wouldn't you?

817
00:57:52,629 --> 00:57:53,390
[SPEAKER_07]: I definitely would.

818
00:57:53,590 --> 00:57:53,830
[SPEAKER_06]: See?

819
00:57:53,850 --> 00:57:58,554
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I just, I just ran across this shirt, um, early, this weekend that said Mario Luigi, oh, wait.

820
00:58:00,762 --> 00:58:03,243
[SPEAKER_06]: And by the way, patent pending on the Rate Me Pyramid Head shirt.

821
00:58:03,263 --> 00:58:05,243
[SPEAKER_06]: If you steal that idea, I'll sue you for a million dollars.

822
00:58:06,743 --> 00:58:07,343
[SPEAKER_07]: We have proof.

823
00:58:07,363 --> 00:58:08,184
[SPEAKER_07]: It's being recorded.

824
00:58:08,384 --> 00:58:08,864
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

825
00:58:09,584 --> 00:58:09,844
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

826
00:58:09,904 --> 00:58:11,564
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Ranma, anything else you want to share with our listeners?

827
00:58:11,584 --> 00:58:12,744
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad to hear you had fun at the con.

828
00:58:13,765 --> 00:58:14,265
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm glad.

829
00:58:14,605 --> 00:58:15,885
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty much it.

830
00:58:16,185 --> 00:58:21,346
[SPEAKER_07]: And we want the New York chapter of OLR, I want you guys to come out to anime next.

831
00:58:21,386 --> 00:58:24,007
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're working with some friends to try to get you guys out of here.

832
00:58:24,527 --> 00:58:25,107
[SPEAKER_06]: When is that?

833
00:58:26,763 --> 00:58:29,025
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe it's the first or second weekend of June.

834
00:58:29,065 --> 00:58:30,506
[SPEAKER_07]: They just announced their date.

835
00:58:30,786 --> 00:58:32,308
[SPEAKER_06]: Just in time for my birthday.

836
00:58:33,769 --> 00:58:35,670
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, if you make it out for your birthday, we'll take you out.

837
00:58:35,730 --> 00:58:38,452
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I celebrated my birthday with you guys for Father May.

838
00:58:38,492 --> 00:58:39,693
[SPEAKER_07]: It's only fair, you know.

839
00:58:39,893 --> 00:58:41,755
[SPEAKER_06]: And speaking of which, are you coming back this year?

840
00:58:41,775 --> 00:58:43,576
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I do believe we were promised Ranma in 08.

841
00:58:45,377 --> 00:58:45,998
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought I said 09.

842
00:58:47,098 --> 00:58:49,520
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was 09 every other year.

843
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:50,941
[SPEAKER_06]: I was trying to switch it up.

844
00:58:51,222 --> 00:58:51,902
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

845
00:58:52,763 --> 00:58:53,023
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

846
00:58:54,451 --> 00:58:55,352
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a good one, Ranma.

847
00:58:55,372 --> 00:58:55,952
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for calling.

848
00:58:55,972 --> 00:58:57,113
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye-bye, guys.

849
00:58:57,133 --> 00:58:57,553
[SPEAKER_06]: Take care.

850
00:58:57,654 --> 00:58:57,994
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye-bye.

851
00:58:59,095 --> 00:59:02,277
[SPEAKER_06]: DMN says Roberts and Summers in 08 would be the ticket.

852
00:59:02,898 --> 00:59:04,319
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what that leaves Loki to do.

853
00:59:04,399 --> 00:59:06,921
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki would have to be the official... He's Secretary of State.

854
00:59:06,961 --> 00:59:07,942
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, he's Court Jester.

855
00:59:08,922 --> 00:59:09,423
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what he is.

856
00:59:09,703 --> 00:59:10,784
[SPEAKER_06]: He can be Speaker of the House.

857
00:59:14,167 --> 00:59:17,589
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, he can be the pet at the White House, like Socks the Cat.

858
00:59:17,629 --> 00:59:18,170
[SPEAKER_06]: We have Loki.

859
00:59:18,590 --> 00:59:18,870
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

860
00:59:19,411 --> 00:59:20,512
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, we've got another caller.

861
00:59:20,532 --> 00:59:20,832
[SPEAKER_01]: Jeremy!

862
00:59:22,261 --> 00:59:23,322
[SPEAKER_01]: Show me who's the official pet.

863
00:59:23,342 --> 00:59:23,382
[SPEAKER_01]: GS68.

864
00:59:23,402 --> 00:59:23,743
[SPEAKER_06]: Good point.

865
00:59:23,763 --> 00:59:24,143
[SPEAKER_06]: The ferret.

866
00:59:43,052 --> 00:59:44,073
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't know where the ferret is.

867
00:59:44,113 --> 00:59:47,275
[SPEAKER_01]: The ferret will not stab you in the face and in fact cannot speak.

868
00:59:47,456 --> 00:59:48,597
[SPEAKER_06]: The ferret is MIA.

869
00:59:49,277 --> 00:59:51,038
[SPEAKER_06]: And now we should sell shirts with ferrets on them.

870
00:59:51,319 --> 00:59:52,279
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's just a ferret.

871
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:53,841
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I think I've seen that before.

872
00:59:53,901 --> 00:59:54,781
[SPEAKER_06]: Never mind, we can't do that.

873
00:59:55,062 --> 00:59:55,742
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to get sued.

874
00:59:57,043 --> 00:59:57,684
[SPEAKER_06]: What's on your mind?

875
00:59:58,024 --> 00:59:59,385
[SPEAKER_06]: Certainly you have something game related.

876
01:00:00,486 --> 01:00:05,490
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, today I went to the GameStop Tournament Edition, which is what I like to call it.

877
01:00:07,051 --> 01:00:10,454
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you've been to the new place that we were talking about earlier in the program.

878
01:00:10,474 --> 01:00:11,235
[SPEAKER_06]: What was it like?

879
01:00:11,735 --> 01:00:12,696
[SPEAKER_06]: What was up with it?

880
01:00:13,707 --> 01:00:18,628
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, first, there's a buttload of kiosks over there where you can, like, play games and such.

881
01:00:20,429 --> 01:00:28,891
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, over in the house where you normally buy games and stuff, you can... They also have a bunch of kiosks over there.

882
01:00:31,031 --> 01:00:41,734
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, now, did it look like a normal GameStop otherwise, or just a bunch of additional kiosks, or... Well... Actually, no, because, like, they had this big stage where...

883
01:00:42,449 --> 01:00:48,212
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a whole bunch of gaming kiosks, and I presume that's for tournaments and stuff.

884
01:00:50,233 --> 01:00:50,734
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, no.

885
01:00:51,294 --> 01:00:52,835
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a regular day.

886
01:00:52,855 --> 01:00:53,035
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

887
01:00:53,115 --> 01:00:54,035
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I guess.

888
01:00:54,056 --> 01:00:54,176
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

889
01:01:09,895 --> 01:01:16,962
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I was driving down Stevens Creek and what caught my attention was the subtitle under the GameStop logo by Barnes & Noble.

890
01:01:18,503 --> 01:01:20,045
[SPEAKER_09]: Where exactly is this GameStop located?

891
01:01:20,965 --> 01:01:27,191
[SPEAKER_09]: It's on the corner of San Tomas Expressway and Stevens Creek Boulevard in San Jose.

892
01:01:27,592 --> 01:01:28,593
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh shit, I know where that is.

893
01:01:28,673 --> 01:01:29,133
[SPEAKER_06]: That's funny.

894
01:01:29,313 --> 01:01:29,574
[SPEAKER_06]: Huh.

895
01:01:30,555 --> 01:01:35,259
[SPEAKER_06]: I might have to check that out at some point because I go to... It's right next to the Barnes & Noble.

896
01:01:36,382 --> 01:01:37,723
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I kind of know where that is.

897
01:01:37,803 --> 01:01:39,284
[SPEAKER_06]: I go down that area quite often.

898
01:01:39,304 --> 01:01:42,725
[SPEAKER_06]: I go to Menlo Park almost every other week, so I might have to check that out.

899
01:01:43,205 --> 01:01:43,765
[SPEAKER_06]: Very cool.

900
01:01:45,166 --> 01:01:48,568
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, anything else you want to share with our listeners after your trip today?

901
01:01:50,128 --> 01:01:50,348
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

902
01:01:51,109 --> 01:01:54,210
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, have a good one and thanks for the first-hand report from being down there.

903
01:01:55,090 --> 01:01:55,631
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks, you too.

904
01:01:55,791 --> 01:01:56,351
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, take care.

905
01:01:57,503 --> 01:01:57,743
[SPEAKER_06]: I like fire.

906
01:01:57,763 --> 01:01:58,103
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not news.

907
01:02:21,005 --> 01:02:27,630
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there's apparently a possibility that an 18 plus version of No More Heroes may actually happen in the future for Europe.

908
01:02:27,990 --> 01:02:30,933
[SPEAKER_04]: So fear not, you may get your uncut version of the game.

909
01:02:32,874 --> 01:02:35,797
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a funny little Wiimote candy dispenser that's out there now.

910
01:02:35,877 --> 01:02:38,739
[SPEAKER_04]: If you go to candyaddict.com

911
01:02:41,260 --> 01:02:43,341
[SPEAKER_04]: You can buy a Wiimote candy dispenser.

912
01:02:43,421 --> 01:02:46,941
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect gift for those kids who may not be able to get a Wii this Christmas.

913
01:02:47,562 --> 01:02:50,962
[SPEAKER_04]: Give them an IOU and a Wii candy dispenser.

914
01:02:51,062 --> 01:02:52,343
[SPEAKER_06]: What a shitty alternative.

915
01:02:52,643 --> 01:02:53,303
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go to the phones.

916
01:02:53,323 --> 01:02:53,923
[SPEAKER_06]: We have another call.

917
01:02:53,963 --> 01:02:54,983
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Haunts Radio.

918
01:02:55,003 --> 01:02:55,363
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

919
01:02:56,444 --> 01:02:58,404
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, this is RossDLUT.

920
01:02:58,884 --> 01:03:00,305
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, RossDLUT.

921
01:03:00,345 --> 01:03:01,085
[SPEAKER_06]: What is on your mind?

922
01:03:02,785 --> 01:03:03,365
[SPEAKER_08]: Not much.

923
01:03:03,725 --> 01:03:10,167
[SPEAKER_08]: I was looking at the November NPDs a few days ago and it's

924
01:03:10,788 --> 01:03:14,150
[SPEAKER_08]: Pretty damn shocking to see how well some of these games have turned out.

925
01:03:14,190 --> 01:03:17,111
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, Call of Duty 4 has just been ridiculous.

926
01:03:17,992 --> 01:03:19,833
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it's just been a lot of sales.

927
01:03:20,373 --> 01:03:29,638
[SPEAKER_08]: The one thing that's been on my mind, and I mentioned this earlier in the chat, is that, yeah, it's great that the Wii is selling all this hardware, but is it really growing a market?

928
01:03:29,918 --> 01:03:35,180
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I mean, you look at all these games that are found, and there's a lot of good, you know, third-party games.

929
01:03:35,581 --> 01:03:37,521
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not like there's nothing on there, you know what I mean?

930
01:03:37,602 --> 01:03:37,842
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

931
01:03:38,822 --> 01:03:40,083
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's like nothing has found a...

932
01:03:41,294 --> 01:03:42,075
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching.

933
01:03:42,095 --> 01:03:43,075
[SPEAKER_08]: See you next time.

934
01:03:48,886 --> 01:03:51,348
[SPEAKER_08]: The same people buying the same four games over and over again.

935
01:03:51,528 --> 01:03:54,630
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there are a shitload of people that are buying the system just for Wii Sports.

936
01:03:54,790 --> 01:03:59,955
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, because that's the game that Nintendo's been very good at getting out there and kind of creating a fad out of.

937
01:04:00,015 --> 01:04:05,700
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if the fad is necessarily... I mean, think about the way most people think about video games in their mind.

938
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:15,548
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of folks don't even realize that this thing is a system capable of playing a multitude of games, but the way that it's been marketed to the soccer moms and everything is as Wii Sports...

939
01:04:16,275 --> 01:04:18,076
[SPEAKER_06]: Get up and move your butt while you play games.

940
01:04:18,196 --> 01:04:20,798
[SPEAKER_06]: Play fake tennis and all that stuff.

941
01:04:20,978 --> 01:04:23,120
[SPEAKER_08]: They've done an amazing job in that regard.

942
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:28,343
[SPEAKER_08]: The question is, I mentioned Zack and Wiki in the chat.

943
01:04:28,383 --> 01:04:29,964
[SPEAKER_08]: I mentioned No More Heroes.

944
01:04:31,165 --> 01:04:36,528
[SPEAKER_08]: Even Rayman 2 has been doing pretty well, but not anywhere near as good as the first one, which was Launch Titles.

945
01:04:36,649 --> 01:04:39,510
[SPEAKER_08]: Launch Titles always have a lucky streak.

946
01:04:41,672 --> 01:04:42,632
[SPEAKER_08]: If all we're getting is...

947
01:04:44,239 --> 01:04:46,456
[SPEAKER_08]: is people buying it for Wii Sports I mean...

948
01:04:47,583 --> 01:04:50,986
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it ever going to be anything more than just a toy, basically?

949
01:04:51,026 --> 01:04:55,109
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it ever going to be anything that anyone who actually wants more than one game is going to want to have?

950
01:04:55,529 --> 01:05:00,313
[SPEAKER_06]: I do, because I think Nintendo is going to try to make Wii Fit the next fad.

951
01:05:01,573 --> 01:05:07,438
[SPEAKER_06]: My gut tells me the way Nintendo's been going with the market lately, I think they are really going to try and make Wii Fit massive.

952
01:05:07,458 --> 01:05:17,025
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to try and get it out there on the Today Show, and on Oprah and all that shit, and that's going to be their next thing that they're going to push and try to get in every home.

953
01:05:18,157 --> 01:05:20,539
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I mean, oh, I expect Wii Fit to do well.

954
01:05:20,579 --> 01:05:23,441
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, all these little stupid little fitness products always do well.

955
01:05:24,282 --> 01:05:29,266
[SPEAKER_08]: The question I'm asking is, I mean, you see the 360s, even the PS3 to some extent.

956
01:05:29,306 --> 01:05:32,529
[SPEAKER_08]: The PS3 had a few good-selling games this month.

957
01:05:32,589 --> 01:05:40,556
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, is it ever going to be where the Wii is a vibrant market, or is it just going to continue to be hostile to everybody who is a Nintendo?

958
01:05:42,898 --> 01:05:43,738
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, that's the...

959
01:05:45,151 --> 01:05:46,331
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the real question.

960
01:05:47,152 --> 01:05:55,454
[SPEAKER_08]: You mentioned, of course, movie games and all that, but a lot of people don't even look at the movie games.

961
01:05:56,255 --> 01:05:56,795
[SPEAKER_08]: It's shocking.

962
01:05:56,955 --> 01:06:00,196
[SPEAKER_08]: Even traditional high-selling games.

963
01:06:00,236 --> 01:06:02,777
[SPEAKER_08]: I was talking to this guy a couple of weeks ago.

964
01:06:02,937 --> 01:06:09,259
[SPEAKER_08]: EA butted heads with Nintendo so they could put the 32 multiplayer online in Medal of Honor Heroes 2.

965
01:06:10,578 --> 01:06:18,681
[SPEAKER_08]: They had the Madden Online for 08, where it works with EA Nation instead of the friend codes, and they're not being rewarded.

966
01:06:18,821 --> 01:06:21,202
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, the third parties are trying, you know, some of them.

967
01:06:22,902 --> 01:06:24,983
[SPEAKER_08]: And of course, No More Heroes is a tragedy.

968
01:06:27,804 --> 01:06:30,705
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, but that... Has that even been released here yet?

969
01:06:30,885 --> 01:06:31,205
[SPEAKER_06]: Which one?

970
01:06:31,546 --> 01:06:31,966
[SPEAKER_06]: No More Heroes?

971
01:06:32,026 --> 01:06:33,806
[SPEAKER_08]: It was released in Japan.

972
01:06:33,866 --> 01:06:37,388
[SPEAKER_08]: Kotaku had a piece on it a couple of weeks ago, where...

973
01:06:38,567 --> 01:06:42,450
[SPEAKER_08]: Suda51 actually went to a huge game store in Akihabara.

974
01:06:42,850 --> 01:06:43,451
[SPEAKER_08]: Nobody went there.

975
01:06:43,951 --> 01:06:45,392
[SPEAKER_08]: He was going to go to sign games.

976
01:06:45,732 --> 01:06:48,494
[SPEAKER_04]: Piles of toilet paper that you could buy or get for free.

977
01:06:48,534 --> 01:06:49,195
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, the toilet paper.

978
01:06:49,335 --> 01:06:51,817
[SPEAKER_08]: They were giving the toilet paper away.

979
01:06:51,837 --> 01:06:52,798
[SPEAKER_08]: They had a model.

980
01:06:52,818 --> 01:06:55,620
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a big launch event and nobody came.

981
01:06:57,921 --> 01:06:59,002
[SPEAKER_08]: That just made me sad.

982
01:06:59,783 --> 01:07:00,163
[SPEAKER_08]: Really.

983
01:07:01,604 --> 01:07:02,425
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not just that game.

984
01:07:02,465 --> 01:07:03,465
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Zack and Wiki.

985
01:07:03,565 --> 01:07:03,706
[SPEAKER_08]: It's

986
01:07:04,625 --> 01:07:07,007
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, one of my favorite games, Mercury Meltdown Revolution.

987
01:07:07,027 --> 01:07:08,427
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think that sold very well.

988
01:07:09,008 --> 01:07:10,409
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at the box art for that game.

989
01:07:10,449 --> 01:07:13,371
[SPEAKER_06]: That isn't something that really jumps out at you as something you should buy.

990
01:07:14,251 --> 01:07:15,032
[SPEAKER_08]: What, Zack and Wiki?

991
01:07:15,612 --> 01:07:17,333
[SPEAKER_06]: No, the Mercury Meltdown Revolution.

992
01:07:17,813 --> 01:07:19,915
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, Mercury Meltdown.

993
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:26,979
[SPEAKER_08]: I could see it was Mercury Meltdown, but Zack and Wiki, I mean, that's... I mean, that's... screams family-friendly.

994
01:07:28,040 --> 01:07:29,721
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a very adorable-looking game.

995
01:07:29,801 --> 01:07:32,483
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not that hard.

996
01:07:33,383 --> 01:07:34,044
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I mean...

997
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:35,921
[SPEAKER_08]: Virtual Console Sales

998
01:07:53,527 --> 01:08:00,351
[SPEAKER_06]: because I bet that's doing crazy business that if we saw the numbers, we'd get sick over the fact that how these games can be used.

999
01:08:00,371 --> 01:08:04,893
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Nintendo mentioned that they made $33 million on the virtual console, which isn't bad.

1000
01:08:05,253 --> 01:08:06,174
[SPEAKER_08]: That is bad.

1001
01:08:06,394 --> 01:08:07,134
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, shit.

1002
01:08:07,334 --> 01:08:08,595
[SPEAKER_08]: No, that's not bad at all.

1003
01:08:09,615 --> 01:08:10,516
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not bad at all.

1004
01:08:10,536 --> 01:08:22,502
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I would be very interested because, you know, considering how much of a hassle it is with the Wii to get online sometimes, I mean, at least with the wireless, I do not understand why they didn't have an FNF port right there.

1005
01:08:23,278 --> 01:08:24,719
[SPEAKER_08]: I would never understand that.

1006
01:08:24,759 --> 01:08:27,501
[SPEAKER_06]: That $33 million is literally free money to them.

1007
01:08:27,521 --> 01:08:30,102
[SPEAKER_06]: It's literally free money made out of thin air.

1008
01:08:30,223 --> 01:08:30,563
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course.

1009
01:08:30,623 --> 01:08:31,503
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all old games.

1010
01:08:32,884 --> 01:08:40,429
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, granted, they have to write those manuals and do the QA testing and all that stuff, but that's pennies compared to the bigger picture.

1011
01:08:40,449 --> 01:08:42,470
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?

1012
01:08:43,011 --> 01:08:44,872
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure a skill programmer could do that in an hour.

1013
01:08:45,252 --> 01:08:45,472
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1014
01:08:46,293 --> 01:08:46,933
[SPEAKER_08]: Crazy.

1015
01:08:47,253 --> 01:08:51,396
[SPEAKER_08]: That's my concern because I have lost three systems and

1016
01:08:52,088 --> 01:09:05,591
[SPEAKER_08]: I want Nintendo to be successful, but I don't want a system that nobody's buying games for eventually taking the rest of the industry down with it.

1017
01:09:07,151 --> 01:09:09,432
[SPEAKER_08]: You see the trends.

1018
01:09:09,732 --> 01:09:12,872
[SPEAKER_08]: You see more of these little mini-game crap coming out.

1019
01:09:14,173 --> 01:09:19,234
[SPEAKER_08]: Personally, I don't blame the third parties because if they're not going to get big sales, they may as well go for the quick buck.

1020
01:09:21,618 --> 01:09:32,042
[SPEAKER_08]: That could end up hurting the Wii after the Wii Sports FAD is done, or if the Wii Fit doesn't work very well here.

1021
01:09:33,182 --> 01:09:45,906
[SPEAKER_08]: Nintendo's riding on real thin ground if they don't at least try to get the quality control up and try to help people realize, hey, this thing has other games.

1022
01:09:45,926 --> 01:09:48,307
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, Mario Galaxy didn't do as well in Japan.

1023
01:09:48,347 --> 01:09:48,927
[SPEAKER_08]: What the hell?

1024
01:09:50,380 --> 01:09:51,501
[SPEAKER_06]: That is a little bit surprising.

1025
01:09:53,722 --> 01:09:57,724
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I thought, honestly, I thought Mario Galaxy was going to do a million in a week.

1026
01:09:58,284 --> 01:09:58,624
[SPEAKER_08]: Honestly.

1027
01:09:59,064 --> 01:10:00,285
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it's Mario.

1028
01:10:01,706 --> 01:10:03,066
[SPEAKER_08]: It's freaking Mario.

1029
01:10:04,867 --> 01:10:08,469
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways, I've been ranting too long and I'm sure a whole lot of people want to get on the line.

1030
01:10:08,529 --> 01:10:09,209
[SPEAKER_06]: That's alright.

1031
01:10:09,950 --> 01:10:11,311
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, we've got to let you go anyway for time.

1032
01:10:11,351 --> 01:10:11,971
[SPEAKER_06]: But take care, buddy.

1033
01:10:12,911 --> 01:10:13,392
[SPEAKER_08]: You do the same.

1034
01:10:13,812 --> 01:10:14,032
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye-bye.

1035
01:10:15,274 --> 01:10:20,678
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, I think that's actually going to do it for calls tonight because we're running a little bit long tonight so we're going to go ahead and start to wrap up the program.

1036
01:10:21,019 --> 01:10:23,180
[SPEAKER_06]: I do want to check and see if there's any more last minute stories.

1037
01:10:24,341 --> 01:10:24,521
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1038
01:10:25,722 --> 01:10:28,745
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, let's see here real quick I was just going to mention a few things that were kind of funny.

1039
01:10:29,445 --> 01:10:38,993
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, there's actually a game coming out in Europe and this is really sad called MTV Fan Attack and it looks like you're like a VJ running from fans.

1040
01:10:40,294 --> 01:10:40,814
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

1041
01:10:41,815 --> 01:10:42,756
[SPEAKER_04]: Wonderful shit.

1042
01:10:44,157 --> 01:10:44,297
[SPEAKER_04]: Um,

1043
01:10:45,359 --> 01:10:49,081
[SPEAKER_04]: And then this will piss off my wife really bad.

1044
01:10:49,662 --> 01:10:54,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Her big complaint, you remember, I don't know, Rob, you probably remember her complaint about this.

1045
01:10:55,145 --> 01:10:56,326
[SPEAKER_04]: The Golden Compass movie.

1046
01:10:57,006 --> 01:10:59,567
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, the ending was not like the book.

1047
01:10:59,848 --> 01:11:03,009
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a major scene that's cut out of the movie.

1048
01:11:04,891 --> 01:11:07,652
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, not to give away any spoilers, but I will.

1049
01:11:08,533 --> 01:11:14,016
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, a kid gets killed, or sacrificed to open a portal, you know.

1050
01:11:14,693 --> 01:11:16,474
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, if that was in Portal, that'd make the game even better.

1051
01:11:17,994 --> 01:11:18,975
[SPEAKER_04]: Sacrificing bratty kids.

1052
01:11:19,415 --> 01:11:23,716
[SPEAKER_04]: But, apparently, that footage, though, is in the game if you finish the game.

1053
01:11:24,316 --> 01:11:28,958
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I will have to show this to her tonight, and I'm sure a director's cut of the movie will be in order.

1054
01:11:30,899 --> 01:11:31,179
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm.

1055
01:11:32,899 --> 01:11:33,280
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

1056
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:35,900
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else from Last Minute News tonight?

1057
01:11:39,762 --> 01:11:40,022
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1058
01:11:40,302 --> 01:11:42,803
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a Me Too cover that's kind of funny for No More Heroes.

1059
01:11:43,023 --> 01:11:43,163
[SPEAKER_04]: Heh.

1060
01:11:44,345 --> 01:12:03,495
[SPEAKER_04]: and then I got a new they have a new wallpaper up on the No More Heroes website which this will now be my new wallpaper if Rob you want to take a look here oh yeah with him charging his that's disgusting beam saber awesome DarkSakura you have anything last minute for us?

1061
01:12:06,196 --> 01:12:12,499
[SPEAKER_06]: I like pie that's not a spoiler no alright anyhow

1062
01:12:13,479 --> 01:12:19,720
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go around and get final thoughts for our program, because we're going to wrap this up and call it a week.

1063
01:12:20,940 --> 01:12:21,800
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, your final thought.

1064
01:12:22,901 --> 01:12:25,701
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope we can fix my computer situation early.

1065
01:12:25,721 --> 01:12:42,784
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually thought of something during the show that I need to check on, because my power supply apparently has a turbo mode on it and a normal mode, and the normal mode has the 12-volt rail broken up into four different rails, whereas turbo has it on one, and I'm wondering if I maybe switch that, if it'll work

1066
01:12:44,266 --> 01:12:48,069
[SPEAKER_04]: Although I still think that the motherboard or graphics card is broken, so we'll see.

1067
01:12:48,969 --> 01:12:53,032
[SPEAKER_04]: But I get to play tons of games this week, taking Wednesday through Friday off to play games.

1068
01:12:54,192 --> 01:12:57,254
[SPEAKER_06]: My final thought is I have a two and a half week vacation coming up.

1069
01:12:57,355 --> 01:12:59,376
[SPEAKER_06]: I just have to get through one more week of work to get there.

1070
01:12:59,756 --> 01:13:00,036
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

1071
01:13:00,056 --> 01:13:00,777
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm so excited.

1072
01:13:01,237 --> 01:13:02,398
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm going to play a lot of games too.

1073
01:13:02,758 --> 01:13:06,400
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm going to work on Orange Lounge Radio stuff, which will be fun.

1074
01:13:06,460 --> 01:13:07,201
[SPEAKER_06]: Jamie, your final thought.

1075
01:13:08,277 --> 01:13:16,124
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to get Orange Box on PC so I can use the editor to put the Half-Life 2 maps in Portal and use the Portal gun in Half-Life.

1076
01:13:17,085 --> 01:13:17,325
[SPEAKER_06]: Fun.

1077
01:13:18,326 --> 01:13:19,127
[SPEAKER_06]: You get to work on that.

1078
01:13:20,728 --> 01:13:21,188
[SPEAKER_06]: Eventually.

1079
01:13:23,206 --> 01:13:27,988
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much for tuning in to our program tonight and supporting independent podcasting and independent radio.

1080
01:13:28,028 --> 01:13:28,868
[SPEAKER_06]: We really appreciate it.

1081
01:13:29,168 --> 01:13:32,610
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember, if you like our show, tell two people you know about the program.

1082
01:13:32,670 --> 01:13:37,271
[SPEAKER_06]: That way, we slowly begin to take over the world as more and more people discover our little program.

1083
01:13:37,592 --> 01:13:42,113
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember, there will be no live show next week with us on December 23rd.

1084
01:13:42,353 --> 01:13:44,234
[SPEAKER_06]: There will be something for the live listeners on the stream.

1085
01:13:44,924 --> 01:13:48,107
[SPEAKER_06]: with some of our other OLR personalities.

1086
01:13:48,147 --> 01:13:50,129
[SPEAKER_06]: But DarkSakura, myself, and Loki will have the night off.

1087
01:13:50,490 --> 01:13:55,595
[SPEAKER_06]: So we will see you back on the podcast on December 30th for the year-end review show.

1088
01:13:55,715 --> 01:13:56,676
[SPEAKER_06]: So see you then.

1089
01:13:56,716 --> 01:13:57,036
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye-bye.

1090
01:13:59,619 --> 01:14:03,002
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:14:03,342 --> 01:14:06,005
