Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, December the 16th of 2007.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
In the last segment we had a bunch of fun news.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We gave out our inaugural Stupid Awards, so check that out in part A.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Also we talked a little bit about the Wii and those rain checks.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Talking about Activision and harmonics not being able to get along.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
But that's all in part A.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We're going to kick off part B tonight with some Squeenix news.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Yes, Loki?

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Yes.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
In fact, I don't know if you might remember this video from a while ago.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Temptation Sonata had a very, very annoying song to it with this...

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I kind of like this song.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I believe it was even a cage match pick at one time.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Anyways, you may remember that the video featured blatant rip-offs of scenes from Advent Children.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Well, apparently Squeenix won a case against them for plagiarism.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:21,000
And to the tune of 16 million won, or $17,400.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I guess the one is pesos, apparently.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
So, yeah.

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Oh well.

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
$17,000.

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
That's not bad.

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
But the video was pretty cool.

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I mean, I don't know if you saw it.

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I've seen it.

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
It was neat.

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
She had two other good songs on the album, too.

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It was neat because it was Advent Children, but other than that it was...

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Here's a little clip of the song, which I know does not do very well for a radio that

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
we're looking at a little component of the video here in studio.

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Actually, maybe we won't.

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It doesn't want to play.

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It's probably because operator plagiarized.

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Oh, is it really?

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I have the whole album.

38
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Oh.

39
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
It's Ivy.

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
We don't have to take a look at that.

41
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Oh, that's okay.

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It's not that important.

43
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It's track two on the album.

44
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
There we go.

45
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Ah, it's just not even in the song yet.

46
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Forget it.

47
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Operator 11, our bandwidth screwed thanks to them.

48
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Yeah, it's alright.

49
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm not that worried about it because I want to talk more about this.

50
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Forget Square Enix winning all this money from this poor Korean chick who's singing.

51
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I mean, whatever happened at the same time?

52
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Invitation is the finest form of flattery.

53
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Have you ever heard that?

54
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Well, if you imitate it so well that, yeah.

55
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Alright, well, anyhow.

56
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Final Fantasy IV is getting a sequel, and this to me is awesome news.

57
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I am so happy because Final Fantasy IV is my favorite in the entire Final Fantasy series.

58
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I know.

59
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Say what you will.

60
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Final Fantasy VII, rah rah rah.

61
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Final Fantasy IX, rah rah rah.

62
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
There's always that back and forth.

63
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I have a soft spot in my heart for Final Fantasy IV because it was really the first Final Fantasy

64
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
game I was just so sucked into start to finish the entire way.

65
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
The game is going to be called Final Fantasy IV The After Return to the Moon.

66
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
It is a true sequel to the game which originally came out in 1991.

67
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
And then, do you know how this just ruined my day?

68
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It's coming out in February on mobile phones.

69
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
That's right.

70
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
The Final Fantasy IV sequel is a mobile phone game.

71
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It's coming out on NTT Docomo phones.

72
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
We don't even have stuff this powerful over here in this country that can run this stuff.

73
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Yeah, we do.

74
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
They can run these type of games like they have in Japan?

75
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:47,000
We do, but they're expensive and they don't put anything out on them.

76
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
They've got them out over in Europe too.

77
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It shouldn't be that big of a surprise because we've already heard about Parasite Eve III

78
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
and a Kingdom Hearts game coming over to mobile phone platforms.

79
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
But I don't want to play Final Fantasy IV on my mobile phone.

80
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
At least give me the freaking DS.

81
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I was so angsty when I read this news earlier in the week.

82
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I said, you know what, I know what segment I want to have follow this news story when we read it this week.

83
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Privacy FUs of the week and Jamie's going to start us off.

84
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
My FU of the week goes towards the doctor that I saw who is not my regular doctor.

85
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
First of all, I'm not an idiot.

86
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
You can tell me what's freaking wrong.

87
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
You can tell me what you suspect to be wrong.

88
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
And, you know, I usually can follow what you're saying.

89
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
My doctor is great, okay?

90
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,000
If ever I remotely suspect anything is wrong or have an idea of what might be the cause.

91
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You know me, I'll research the crap out of everything.

92
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
He listens to me and then he actually tests for the stuff that I suggest.

93
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Which is how we found out, you know, found out how to treat chronic fatigue for me.

94
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
So that I could actually, you know, not pass out on a daily basis or be hurt or anything.

95
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:22,000
What happened is when I was in Alabama, and I don't know how I did it, but my right hand ring finger started, the tendon started to catch.

96
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,000
And I wouldn't be able to lift my finger in the morning unless I massaged it and got blood flowing.

97
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:35,000
And it was really inflamed along the tendon that goes down my palm, so I went to see this doctor.

98
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
And my regular doctor, I guess, was out for the holidays or something.

99
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,000
So, you know, he tested it and, you know, I had been icing it and doing all the right stuff.

100
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
But he said, okay, we're going to give you a cortisone shot.

101
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I was like, what's actually wrong with it?

102
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Oh, it's fine, we'll just do the shot.

103
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
And so he didn't tell me anything, so I actually, I got a cortisone shot in my hand.

104
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And he wouldn't let me watch it either.

105
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It pissed me off because I actually, I don't have the fear of needles that I used to, you know.

106
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I give myself a shot in the leg twice a week.

107
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I can stand watching a needle in my hand.

108
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:15,000
So he said he wouldn't do it until I, you know, would not watch him put the needle in.

109
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I was like, dude, I'm not going to pass out.

110
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
And he's like, are you squeamish?

111
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Are you going to pass out?

112
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I'm like, no.

113
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,000
And so it took me looking up the symptoms myself and then looking up the treatments

114
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
to realize that he was treating me for trigger finger.

115
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Which is funny because my grandma actually just had surgery on that one like about a month ago.

116
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Runs in the family, right?

117
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
It's not hereditary.

118
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Trigger finger has to do with inflammation of the tendons

119
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
and that it's slipping out of the tendon sheath that goes over the tendons.

120
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Then it's just irony.

121
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Yeah, it's coincidence.

122
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
However, I will go ahead and say that I am having a lot less pain in the hand.

123
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
It's going to be another few days before the cortisone takes full effect

124
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
and I start physical therapy next week.

125
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
So that's, you know, fun, but not.

126
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:15,000
So F.U. to doctors who do not communicate with their patients.

127
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I'm going to go back and see my regular doctor.

128
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Let's move on, Loki, your F.U.

129
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Anyways, my F.U. of the week.

130
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Not a big surprise to EVGA for giving me a card that's set on arrival.

131
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
For the other thing also, for the card being a gimp version of the normal card that should have been,

132
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
or the motherboard being a gimp version of that,

133
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
with no possible way for me to know what's going wrong when there is something going wrong.

134
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
So now I just have to kind of guess.

135
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It'll be the last time I buy a motherboard from them

136
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
and it'll probably be the last time I buy a motherboard from Newegg as well

137
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,000
because they apparently are pawning off crap that's gimp versions of the real thing.

138
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
So, that sucks.

139
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I'll buy from Fry's, so that way if it sucks and it's not working,

140
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I can take it right back the next day or the same day,

141
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
instead of having to do this whole RMA process.

142
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Alright, is that it?

143
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
That's it.

144
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
My F.U. of the week goes to Mondays.

145
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I'll keep it short, I hate Mondays as do we all.

146
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
You know, Jamie, when you get that controlling time thing figured out,

147
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
can you figure out a way to do away with Mondays?

148
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Maybe we should just give Monday a different name.

149
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Fun Day!

150
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
But it would be the same thing.

151
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
No, I don't like that idea.

152
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Mondays are horrible.

153
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Alright, so that's it, that's my F.U. of the week.

154
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Now we can get back into some gaming news, can't we?

155
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Yes, we can.

156
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Well, we have some news.

157
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
For our friends who are interested in GameTap,

158
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:55,000
we will be having Street Fighter III Third Strike as of December 20th.

159
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:01,000
No online play, but it's Street Fighter III Third Strike.

160
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
So, hey, that's good.

161
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
And on top of that, if you've got the Capcom joystick,

162
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I think that they actually do have some compatibility with it through GameTap.

163
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
It's been a long time since I've used that service.

164
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I was kind of sad about the games leaving,

165
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
and I guess they did some client upgrade.

166
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I haven't even checked it out yet.

167
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
If I'm not playing it enough, I ought to just cancel the darn thing,

168
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
but there's still a lot about it I like.

169
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
We'll see.

170
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Moving on with more news.

171
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Yes.

172
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Anyways, so, I don't know, this isn't really a big surprise for me,

173
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
but Mass Effect is selling very well.

174
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
In fact, they've sold millions.

175
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Over the three weeks since launch,

176
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
they have sold over one million units globally,

177
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
and that should be pretty good, I guess.

178
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I don't know. It's a good game.

179
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I'd like to sell a million copies of anything.

180
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
That would be pretty good for business, I would think.

181
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Millions of copies.

182
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
A lot of people would like certain other games to sell a million copies worldwide.

183
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Like the Eye of Judgment?

184
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Maybe.

185
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Maybe they'll sell millions of movies on the Xbox Live Marketplace pretty soon,

186
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
because now it has expanded, finally, after all this time.

187
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
It's not just the North America-U.S.

188
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
It's just the U.S. really had the video marketplace before.

189
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Now it's expanding to other parts of North America, including Canada,

190
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:38,000
and then overseas as well, the U.K., Ireland, France, and Germany

191
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
are all getting the Xbox Live Marketplace finally in their territories.

192
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
We would tell you more about what's on it,

193
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
but how many of you guys don't have Netflix accounts

194
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
or some other way of getting your movies?

195
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
No, I guess the Xbox Live Marketplace is pretty cool

196
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
for looking at high-def stuff on demand.

197
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:03,000
The Microsoft Points breakdown structure is very similar to what they have here in the U.S.,

198
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
but just translated for the other countries

199
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
when it comes to how much they pay for the Microsoft Points.

200
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Well, there you have it.

201
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Of course, some people might just kind of think,

202
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
why should I even bother with the video marketplace at all

203
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
now that the Xbox 360 has DIVX?

204
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
That's a very good question.

205
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
DIVX is special.

206
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
It's the right thing. You want to do the legal thing, right?

207
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Right?

208
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp.

209
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
All right, more news.

210
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
All right, well, hey, guess what?

211
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Assassin's Creed has sold a bunch.

212
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
They have sold 2.5 million copies globally,

213
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
and they've sold a whole bunch more than they thought it would.

214
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
They are hoping to reach 5 million by March 08.

215
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
And I still have yet to play the damn game.

216
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I think I have it.

217
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
You can probably borrow mine.

218
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Really?

219
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Yeah.

220
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I kind of want to play it before our year-end show,

221
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
because I hear a lot of people saying it's a great game

222
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
and deserves to be on year-end's best list.

223
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
So it won't make mine, though,

224
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
if I don't ever get a chance to play it.

225
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
So I may take you up on that, Jamie.

226
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Did you play Assassin's Creed, Loki?

227
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
You talked about it.

228
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Briefly.

229
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
You didn't like it, right?

230
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
No.

231
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
What was your problem with it?

232
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I don't know.

233
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I just didn't like how intricate it was.

234
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
The control scheme for it, I didn't care for.

235
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I just really didn't get to play it much.

236
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
The thing was, it didn't really hook me, I guess.

237
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I played it for a few minutes.

238
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I was like, eh, I don't really want to give this any more time.

239
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
All right.

240
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
So I didn't.

241
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Anyways, there's some interesting news coming out

242
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
from the company Gearbox.

243
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:53,000
And, of course, they have done stuff

244
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
like the brand new Brothers in Arms series.

245
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Hell's Highway, actually, one of the titles

246
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
that keeps getting pushed back.

247
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:07,000
So one thing that they're looking for for some inspiration

248
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
is actually the game Portal.

249
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Because most of their games, I think, in the past

250
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
have been pretty linear.

251
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
They like the way that Portal, the whole story layout

252
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
and stuff like that.

253
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Hopefully, in the future, we'll see some more futuristic games

254
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
from Gearbox.

255
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
So that's pretty cool.

256
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Now, you're a big fan of Portal, Jamie.

257
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Yes, I am.

258
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
And do you believe that more games should

259
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
take inspiration from Portal?

260
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I think so.

261
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I mean, because, honestly, what they're doing

262
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
is taking, I actually have to say,

263
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
because also listening to some of the commentary in the game,

264
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I think it was pretty cool that they were taking

265
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
different concepts in physics and trying

266
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
to incorporate them into the gameplay in a completely

267
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
different way.

268
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Changing, instead of having puzzle here,

269
00:13:52,000 --> 00:14:00,000
you don't necessarily think in height and width and depth.

270
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
You think in terms of manipulating that space

271
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
to your own ends.

272
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
And I think that that's pretty cool.

273
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
And it completely offers a completely different range

274
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
of freedom, I think, as far as how they can design a game.

275
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Very cool.

276
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I'm going to have to listen to that commentary stuff

277
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,000
sometime.

278
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I think more games should have commentary tracks on it.

279
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I think that's a pretty interesting idea.

280
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Well, it's hard to have a commentary track in the game.

281
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I like the way that Portal kind of did it,

282
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
where you just kind of go up to something

283
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
and then kind of play the game from there.

284
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
It had like a little chat box over it

285
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
that you could highlight with your gun.

286
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
And then it would play.

287
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
And it actually gave you a meter bar

288
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
so you see how far through the commentary you were

289
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
and you could pause it.

290
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Huh.

291
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
That's pretty cool.

292
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Well, of course, there are a lot of fans of Portal.

293
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,000
And I'm sure this is something that Jamie would want to get.

294
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
It's a plush companion cube.

295
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
That's right.

296
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
There is officially.

297
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Now, you may have seen this, that there

298
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
was a lot of fan-made weighted companion cubes being made

299
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
and there was a lot of fan stuff.

300
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Well, Valve actually decided to put their own version out

301
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
because I'm sure they're seeing what other people are doing

302
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
and they're like, hey, we need to get a piece of that.

303
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
So they put out official weighted companion cube

304
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
plushies.

305
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
And in less than 24 hours, the damn thing sold out.

306
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
That's how popular these things are.

307
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I'm actually seeing if they still have the fuzzy dice.

308
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
They went on sale at 4 o'clock on Friday

309
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
and sold out by noon on Saturday.

310
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
That's crazy.

311
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I guess they'll have to make more.

312
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I just want the fuzzy dice.

313
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
These could be more popular than the Wii.

314
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I just want the fuzzy dice.

315
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
You just want the fuzzy dice?

316
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Are you actually going to hang them in your car?

317
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Yes, I will because my Pac-Man dice are highly faded now.

318
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Oh, that's too bad.

319
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Well, then your weighted companion cubes will fade.

320
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
They'll burn up just like they do in the game.

321
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Spoiler.

322
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Oh, my bad.

323
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
You know what?

324
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Dan was really funny about that part.

325
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
How so?

326
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I think it's what I'd mentioned to you earlier.

327
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Dan's like, yeah, it's very obvious that the character

328
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
you're playing is female because they expect you to get

329
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
all sappy and all sobby over your weighted companion

330
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
cube being dead.

331
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
It's a cube.

332
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I was like, you don't get it.

333
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
You can also tell your main character's a woman

334
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
because in the very beginning of the game,

335
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
there's like a mirror.

336
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
And you see that your character has boobs, OMG boobs.

337
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Well, he was joking.

338
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
If you look at her face, though, that could very well be a man.

339
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
It's pretty ugly.

340
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
He's actually modeled after some person.

341
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
She's a man, baby.

342
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
He was cracking up, though, over the part where you get out

343
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
after the 19th.

344
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
What is up with Chat?

345
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Chat is on their like crazy kick where they're just now naming

346
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
all of these games, putting Portal in place of the titles

347
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
of the games.

348
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Portal of Honor, Need for Portal, Portal of Duty,

349
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Portal Combat, Super Smash Portal, Portal, Portal Paradise,

350
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
The King of Portal 11.

351
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
What the hell is wrong with you people?

352
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
It's the cocaine.

353
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
There's a lot of cocaine.

354
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Have we been giving out cocaine in Chat?

355
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Share, please.

356
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
No kidding.

357
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
All right.

358
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Well, moving on to other gaming news then.

359
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I don't want to.

360
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
You have to.

361
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
OK.

362
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Lost Odyssey is supposed to, it's actually going to be out

363
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
on Xbox 360 as an exclusive RPG.

364
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
And it has a release date of February 12th.

365
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
And downloadable content will be on its way.

366
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Aren't I supposed to be able to get download content for free

367
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
if I pre-order or something?

368
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I thought I read something about that.

369
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
It's actually saying that downloadable content will be

370
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
made exclusive to anyone who pre-orders.

371
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Oh.

372
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Oh, so I don't get free download content.

373
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I just get to, I get to pay more to have the download content

374
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
if I pre-order.

375
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Oh, OK.

376
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
That would make more sense.

377
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I would hope so.

378
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Because they can use the codes and stuff, right?

379
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Yeah.

380
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
They'll give you codes.

381
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
That's what I would think.

382
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
All right.

383
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I don't know if you've heard much about this game yet.

384
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Well, I didn't get very highly, or reviews weren't that great

385
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
on it in Japan.

386
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
The trailer looked really good.

387
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
It did.

388
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
But then I heard it's not doing, like it did not get very well

389
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
received over in Japan.

390
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
So that makes me a little less excited about it.

391
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
What's interesting though, which people might not know,

392
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
is it's on four DVDs.

393
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Just like Blue Dragon was on three.

394
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Wow.

395
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Go DVDs.

396
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Yay.

397
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Can't fit all that space on there.

398
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
So sad.

399
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
This game must be epic.

400
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
It's very epic.

401
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
You know what, actually, sadly enough,

402
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
know what the game looked like, and that's not really a good point for it.

403
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Kind of reminds me a little bit of, oh god, what is that game now?

404
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I just had the name.

405
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I don't know, you bought it.

406
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
It's like, not Phantasy Star.

407
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
99 Nights?

408
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Not 99 Nights.

409
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Enchanted Arms.

410
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Oh, OK.

411
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Yeah, that's not a good thing to be compared to.

412
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Enchanted Arms wasn't horrible, it just wasn't great.

413
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I don't know.

414
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Anyways, so, the Mega Man 20th anniversary countdown apparently ends tonight.

415
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
And what exactly does that mean?

416
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Well, who knows?

417
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
But there's going to be a big announcement, of course, coming soon.

418
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Probably, I'd imagine, a new game.

419
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Hopefully not another, like, oh surprise, it's a remake or another collection.

420
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Mega Man Battle Network again.

421
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Yay.

422
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Yay.

423
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
How about Mega Man Legends 3?

424
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Haven't you guys been hankering for some of that for a while?

425
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Fuck yeah.

426
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Of course, they're never going to give that to us.

427
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Never say never.

428
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Some theories might be that Mega Man's going to be announced as an official character in Super Smash Bros. Brawl,

429
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
which I would think that would be covered on the daily updates on their stupid website.

430
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I think they would have done it already, if that was true.

431
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I was seeing right now, if there's any sort of update here, other than, well, right now it just says,

432
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I guess, four hours and four minutes?

433
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I can't read Japanese, dammit.

434
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:11,000
But there's 0404, so either I got the wrong page,

435
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
which is entirely possible.

436
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Happy birthday, Rockman.

437
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Still looking like a chick.

438
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:25,000
RawstealUT says in response to the whole Mega Man Legends 3,

439
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
SkyCapcom can't do that.

440
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
That'd make Mega Man relevant again.

441
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I guess that's true.

442
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Jamie made a face at that comment.

443
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
What was that face about?

444
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
You made a face.

445
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
It was just a face.

446
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Oh, I see.

447
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
It was an angry face, or it was a ger face.

448
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
It was a face.

449
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I see.

450
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
All right.

451
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Well, now I know this news ought to make Jamie happy.

452
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
This is something that will make Jamie very happy for Christmas.

453
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
But I don't know, maybe not.

454
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Christmas Nights, you know, Jamie always talks about her annual tradition

455
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
of putting the Saturn back up and playing some Christmas Nights every year.

456
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Well, maybe she won't have to anymore because it is going to be included

457
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,000
in the PlayStation 2 remake of Nights into Dreams for the PlayStation 2.

458
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
It's going to have Christmas Nights as well.

459
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
The bad news for Jamie, it's a Japan-only release,

460
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
so she's going to have to pay more money to import it.

461
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Like, that's a bad thing at all.

462
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I've got a Japanese PlayStation 2.

463
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I do have to admit, remember they said they weren't really remaking the game?

464
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Uh-huh.

465
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
The graphics do look a little bit sharper.

466
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Well, they probably went back and undressed some things

467
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
and cleaned some things up.

468
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
To also make another point,

469
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:34,000
the Saturn did not have nearly the 3D capability that the PlayStation did.

470
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
And so being on the PlayStation 2,

471
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
one would think that it has a better 3D processor than the Saturn would.

472
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
So it would have to be cleaner textures and that type of thing.

473
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Yeah, but true.

474
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
But then you also forget the fact that people like to slack off

475
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
when they port games over and they'll just port them exactly the same

476
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
for authentic purposes, you know?

477
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I think even so, even if it was ported over just the same,

478
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,000
it still has better, it'd be better capable of processing it.

479
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Now, Jamie, it's not going to be as simple, unfortunately,

480
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
as paying all the money to import the game

481
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
because not only are you going to have to do that,

482
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
but then you have to beat Nights into Dreams

483
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
and then you will unlock Christmas Dreams.

484
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Tell me how that's hard.

485
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I'm just saying, you've got to put a little bit of work into it.

486
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
You might have to lift a finger, Jamie, to get your Christmas Dreams.

487
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
You know the hardest thing about that is going to be playing

488
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
without getting motion sick

489
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
because Nights is another one of those games that makes me motion sick.

490
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I got really sick playing Portal earlier.

491
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Okay, Portal, right cake attorney.

492
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Okay, no more Portal jokes.

493
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Jesus, they are still going.

494
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
That's great.

495
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Shut up.

496
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Portal, right cake attorney.

497
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I'm leaving chat so I don't have to read any more of that.

498
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Lordy.

499
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Chat room, you're banned from commenting on our program for a little bit

500
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
so you can calm down with the Portal stuff.

501
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Portal combat.

502
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
If they could behave.

503
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
All right, we'll see if they can behave during our next segment,

504
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
the weekly mailbag segment.

505
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Every week you send in your e-mails to mailbag at orangelaundry.com

506
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
and we pick a few of our favorites to read right here on the air.

507
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
And Jamie will read them and we'll compliment you or we'll make fun of you

508
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
or we'll answer your question or we'll sing a song and dance.

509
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Who knows, it's unpredictable.

510
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
It's the mailbag segment.

511
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Jamie, open up ye old mailbag and tell us what's in it this week.

512
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I will be doing neither song nor dance, just to make a point of order.

513
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
But if you'd like to, you can dance to the song playing in the background.

514
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Those of you playing along at home.

515
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
No, you can't.

516
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I'll pop my head.

517
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
First e-mail.

518
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
From Riz, I guess is how it's pronounced.

519
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Hi Rob, Jamie, and Matt.

520
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000
This e-mail was constructed for a number of reasons which are detailed below.

521
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I would first like to say what a pleasure listening to your podcast has been.

522
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Oh, thank you.

523
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I have enjoyed OOR since around March and have been greatly entertained

524
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
by their mix of news, banter, and general chaos.

525
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I have been visually impaired since birth

526
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
but was able to play a number of video games when I was younger.

527
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Due to a deterioration in my eyesight over the years,

528
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
the number of games I can play is now greatly reduced.

529
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I still like to follow the rather hectic and frantic world of video games

530
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
and your podcast is perfect for that.

531
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
I have a question regarding music and podcasts which I would greatly appreciate an answer.

532
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
I've just started my own podcast and would like to know

533
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
am I able to use video game music for intros and outros?

534
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Obviously, the podcast is free.

535
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I apologize if this e-mail has gone too long.

536
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Keep up the good work.

537
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
I find that most companies and stuff generally don't care

538
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
if you use video game music and stuff.

539
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
It's promotion for them.

540
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
What do they care?

541
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
I believe there's some type of fair use law out there or something

542
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
that as long as you limit it to 30 seconds, you're fine.

543
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Nobody can really sue you over it.

544
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Sure, the polite thing to do is ask and all that stuff,

545
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
but I think as long as you use it, especially the old stuff,

546
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
the old 8-Bit stuff which I know a lot of podcasts use for their openings and things,

547
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
nobody's really going to care.

548
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
I think it's fine.

549
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Next e-mail.

550
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
I would like to thank Sky Dark Sakura and Loki

551
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
for hosting the best gaming podcast on the internet.

552
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
I just started listening a couple of weeks ago and already I'm hooked.

553
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
I've already been scouring the internet for all the episodes I can download.

554
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
I listen to them on my PSP.

555
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
More PSP listeners?

556
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
I said in part A. There were some. They do exist.

557
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
There's no better place for gaming news and humor.

558
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
One quick question though.

559
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Is there anywhere I can download previous episodes?

560
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
The RSS feed only goes back a few episodes

561
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
and there's about 250 more I can't find.

562
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Thanks and screw Rock Band for sucking so much online.

563
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
pkgr92

564
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
If you go to OLRPSP.com,

565
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
the parser over there actually goes back a few more episodes,

566
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
which if you're listening on your PSP, you've probably already done.

567
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
You can go back about 20 episodes there.

568
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Otherwise, we keep, I think, some of the websites like

569
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Yahoo Podcasts, I want to say.

570
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
What about iTunes?

571
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Podcast Alley.

572
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,000
The one on iTunes only goes back 10 listings, which is about five episodes.

573
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:16,000
The reason for that is to prevent what happened a few years ago to some podcasts

574
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
is that this new application came out for the Xbox 360 called XB Stream.

575
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
It's a great idea and a great application.

576
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
We're actually a default podcast that's on it when you put this thing in.

577
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
But for the default podcast that we're on, the very first version of it,

578
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:34,000
what happened is that the program downloaded every single program from the feed,

579
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
which for people that never cleaned up their feeds,

580
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
meant their server was getting hammered for like 100 downloads of big shows at once.

581
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
So we keep our feed tidy for that reason,

582
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
so that if you use a grabber that does something like that

583
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
where it gets all episodes of a show, you're limited to 10.

584
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
That's pretty much the reason we do it.

585
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
We only do server cleans about once every few months when we need the space.

586
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Otherwise, if you want to find shows older than that,

587
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
ask around the community, post on the forums.

588
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I know there's one person out there that probably has every pre-podcast show we ever did.

589
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I know there's at least one person out there that has that.

590
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
I don't even have that to put it in perspective.

591
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
I've asked and haven't heard anything.

592
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
I have a lot, and we might put out some DVDs out there,

593
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
but we can't do any big releases of it just because of some of the things.

594
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
We might have to do something kind of like under the table for the fans only

595
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
because there was some copyright music, so we can't really sell it for profit.

596
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
But anything's a possibility in the near future, so we'll see.

597
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
There's also a funny quote on here from Loki.

598
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Sure.

599
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Friendship is like peeing on yourself.

600
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Everyone can see it, but only you get the warm feeling it brings.

601
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Wow.

602
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Yeah.

603
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
To Sky.

604
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
I was wondering why every time G4 is brought up on the show,

605
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
you moan and groan about how much you hate it.

606
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
I hate G4.

607
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
It isn't that bad in my opinion.

608
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
The shows such as Attack of the Show being my favorite,

609
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
X-Play, Cheat, and Ninja Warrior are all awesome.

610
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
I can understand that a lot of people wish that it were more like it used to be

611
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,000
when it was tech TV, but had a more gaming-oriented atmosphere to it.

612
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Hell, I'm pissed that they took off icons and replaced it with crap like cheaters and cops.

613
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
But you shouldn't hate G4 completely.

614
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
It still has some great shows on it.

615
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Thanks, Oscar.

616
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
PS, have you guys seen the zero punctuation gaming reviews?

617
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Here's a link to the site.

618
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Oh, I have to see this.

619
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
That's some funny shit.

620
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Yeah, I watch it every week.

621
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
See, that's the kind of shit that G4 needs on television,

622
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
not the crap they have now that feels so, you know,

623
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
where the game reviews are written by interns and all this stuff.

624
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:38,000
X-Play is turned into a speck of what it used to be back when it was on tech TV.

625
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
It's just you pretty much named all the reasons right there in your e-mail.

626
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
It's nothing like it could have been with the whole tech TV merge and stuff,

627
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,000
and it just got too corporate and yucky, and it's owned by E, for God's sakes.

628
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
I mean, I don't know.

629
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,000
It's just everything that's kind of disturbing about corporate media

630
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:00,000
is kind of like embodied in G4, and that's why I just don't like it.

631
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,000
And I'm allowed not to like things.

632
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Next e-mail.

633
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Hi, guys.

634
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Yes.

635
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
I know you don't normally read FUs from listeners,

636
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
but I was in a car accident yesterday, and I really wanted to vent somewhere.

637
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Why not?

638
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,000
To the woman in the Jeep who tried to pass me by going onto the oncoming traffic

639
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
while I was making a U-turn at Big Fat FU.

640
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,000
This is on my last day of finals, and I was just about to go home from Davis,

641
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
and I am pissed off.

642
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
I'm going to have to agree with Loki.

643
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
The woman driver is in the sack area.

644
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
I can't drive for anything, except me.

645
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
That would be me.

646
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Unfortunately, everyone is okay.

647
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Although, my head slams into the car door during the impact.

648
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
The only part of this is that since I won't have a car for a while,

649
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
I'll be able to sit at home and play all the games I want over the break.

650
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
That being the case, what are your favorite games that came out this holiday season

651
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,000
on any console since I guess I'll be looking for something to pass the time?

652
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Keep up the awesome show.

653
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
I need something to keep my spirits up.

654
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
What an awesome way to start the holidays.

655
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Happy holidays, AZHP.

656
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Portal.

657
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
I don't want to give it all away, because then I'd be basically giving you

658
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
my favorite games of the year.

659
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
But I will back up what Jamie said.

660
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,000
I think Orange Box in general is a very good investment.

661
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Here's a thought, though.

662
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Use this period, this opportunity.

663
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
I'm glad you have such a positive attitude about it,

664
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
because that really sucks what happened.

665
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
I'm glad you have a good attitude about it.

666
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Instead of necessarily having to play everything new that comes out,

667
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
go back and play the shit you missed,

668
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
because I bet there's a lot of stuff that you missed towards the end of last year,

669
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
but amongst all the console madness.

670
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
It'll give you a great example for me.

671
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Final Fantasy XII.

672
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
I did not get nearly as far in that game as I would have liked to,

673
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
because it was an amazing battle system in the game,

674
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
and I just never really got a chance to just play it the whole way through to completion.

675
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
That's one of those games I would like to complete one day when there's time.

676
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,000
So I would encourage you to actually take this opportunity to go revisit the past games

677
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
and beat stuff you haven't yet that you wanted to.

678
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
You can go to Deliverance Online and download Ragnarok Online

679
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
and play on the server with me and Ranma,

680
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
and join the OLR Guild on there.

681
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Yeah, there you go.

682
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Join an MMO.

683
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
That'll suck up all your time.

684
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
There you have it.

685
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
AZHP is actually in chat right now and says,

686
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
I just finished XII during finals week.

687
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
LOL.

688
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
How did you have time to beat a Final Fantasy game during finals?

689
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Are you taking home ec?

690
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
What is up with that?

691
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Wow, that's amazing.

692
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Hey, Rob.

693
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
What, what?

694
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
I actually, one of my finals weeks,

695
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
I stayed up for three days and played D&D every night.

696
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Oh, my God.

697
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
You guys are crazy.

698
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
I passed out on the fourth day.

699
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
I was kept alive by Jolt Cola and Pixie Sticks.

700
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Loki, any recommendations for our listener

701
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
who's handicapped for Winter Break

702
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
for games to play while they're on Winter Break?

703
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Well, Call of Duty 4 is pretty good, I guess.

704
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Yeah, actually it is.

705
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Halo 3.

706
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Super Mario Galaxy.

707
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
I don't know.

708
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
You can play a ton of stuff.

709
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
There's tons of games out there.

710
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Just play something you haven't played yet.

711
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
There you go.

712
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
RPGs.

713
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
There you go.

714
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
We'll bring you a Nintendo.

715
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
And you can play classic stuff.

716
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
You can play Guardian Legend.

717
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
That's right.

718
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Go back and play every Saturn game you didn't play previously.

719
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Dear God, I don't have enough room for that.

720
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
All right, anyhow.

721
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I know what you should do.

722
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Find me a copy of Burning Rangers.

723
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Next email, please.

724
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
First of all, Merry early Christmas slash Happy Holidays.

725
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I'm not sure if you're doing an episode for the 23rd,

726
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
and I don't think I can listen live on the 16th,

727
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
which, as of this writing, is today,

728
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
since I have a final exam the next day.

729
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Oops, good luck on that.

730
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
This is from GS68, by the way.

731
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Who happens to be in chat, by the way,

732
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
so I guess he found a way.

733
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Yeah.

734
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Second, there's one particular issue

735
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
that concerns me regarding fellow gamers.

736
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
On sites like Game Politics, Facebook,

737
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
and especially GameSpot,

738
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
there are gamers who are quick to get angry

739
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
and defensive about their games whenever Dr. Phil,

740
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
whose comment on the game usage, not games,

741
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
being a problem was, in my opinion,

742
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
a step in the right direction,

743
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
although many people who commented on the story

744
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
just saw the name Dr. Phil and immediately thought,

745
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
oh my God, it's Dr. Phil, he sucks yours.

746
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,000
JT censorship and school shootings show up.

747
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
In fact, I see comments along the lines of,

748
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
I hope JT gets his ass kicked so hard he goes sterile,

749
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,000
and worse, maybe Microsoft will hire a drifter and kill him.

750
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
It's rather ironic that there are gamers

751
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
who oppose the idea that video games

752
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
make people violent-minded

753
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
and then go on wishing death upon Jackie Pooh.

754
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
I dislike JT as much as the next gamer,

755
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
especially his reaction to gamers' email.

756
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
The Flowers for Jack project and its outcome are a prime example.

757
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
But what he, as gamers, need to realize

758
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
is that by personally attacking him back unprofessionally

759
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
and wishing physical injury or death upon him,

760
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
we are reinforcing his belief that violent video games

761
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
are bad for the mind and stooping to his level

762
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
of ad hominem attacks,

763
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
which is a whole different topic,

764
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
and I'll probably get into future emails,

765
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Skype call, whatever.

766
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Those kinds of personal attacks make us gamers

767
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
look bad in front of people supportive of video game censorship,

768
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
and if we need to get Sensible Worth Academy,

769
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
no, as if we need to get Sensible Worth Academy,

770
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,000
is this kind of defensiveness and immaturity

771
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,000
that also led to the creation of the otaku stereotype.

772
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
And I'm a gamer and an anime slash manga fan,

773
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
so facepalm.

774
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
And with all of that said,

775
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
I wish the three of you and any guests also in the studio

776
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
a great holiday. Don't die in a car fire.

777
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Yours truly, GS68.

778
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
We'll try, thanks.

779
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
PS, are you three going to SAC Anime this January?

780
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
I'm hoping to go, and it would be great to see you guys there

781
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
since I didn't get a chance to go to last summer SAC Anime.

782
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Oh, God, I didn't realize there was one in January, too.

783
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
I forgot about it.

784
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
We should try to do a panel.

785
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
I gotta get in touch with Jonas about that.

786
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
We'll try and go.

787
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Not at 8 in the morning.

788
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Nah, as long as we get a...

789
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Not at 8 in the morning.

790
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
We're not going again if our panel's at 8 in the morning,

791
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
but if we can get something better, we'll go.

792
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
I probably won't cosplay unless it's my, um,

793
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Organization 13 costume, so.

794
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Uh, last email.

795
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Dun dun dun.

796
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
From Cheeseburger.

797
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Who signed it with a question mark?

798
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
I can ask Cheeseburger?

799
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
This is Cheeseburger.

800
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Hey, OLR crew, I have been listening to your podcast

801
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
for almost a year and a half now, and I think it's great.

802
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
You're still with us? Cool.

803
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
That's cool.

804
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
I have also listened live and interacted in chat a few times, too.

805
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
The reason for this email is to ask Rob about Civilization 3,

806
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,000
which I purchased for my new computer on his recommendation.

807
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
What's your perspective on that game?

808
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,000
And I also chose Russia because I thought I could make nuclear weapons

809
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
and blow everything up.

810
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,000
The only other PC games I have are StarCraft and Black & White 2.

811
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
By the way, Loki's comment about having a washer and dryer

812
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
so he could now piss himself with joy was hilarious.

813
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Another email comment, Olive Garden Home of the Never Ending Salads

814
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
was funny, too.

815
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,000
P.S. I think Rob is rad and Kmart sucks, LOLs.

816
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
I think Cheeseburgers are rad.

817
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
I like Cheeseburgers in Paradise.

818
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
As long as there's no mayonnaise on them, because mayonnaise is disgusting.

819
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
I like Cheeseburgers in Paradise.

820
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
What was the question? Civ 3, what is my perspective on Civ 3?

821
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
You don't have to be the Russians to build nuclear weapons.

822
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Anybody builds nuclear weapons.

823
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Hell, in the old school Civilization game,

824
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,000
I used to play as the Zulus or whatever, because they were green.

825
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
I liked green.

826
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
I used to play as them, and I would make nuclear weapons

827
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
and nuke the shit out of the Americans.

828
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
I always like to win by global domination.

829
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Of course, there are multiple ways to win the game.

830
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
I think you get the most points for being the first person in space,

831
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
but that's not nearly as fun as global domination.

832
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:25,000
My favorite thing to do in Civilization is I like to treat everybody really nice.

833
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
I'm like, oh, sure, we'll trade with you.

834
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Let's sign a peace treaty. Oh, we love you.

835
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Then I will take a bunch of army units right outside their city,

836
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
and then I'll nuke the shit out of them.

837
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,000
We actually got one last email that we got last minute.

838
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
I'm going to read it.

839
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:48,000
It's not signed, so I'm just going to say it's from G. Davis, I guess.

840
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Okay.

841
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,000
LLOLR, after listening to your guys' and Jamie's thoughts on DDR on last week's show,

842
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,000
I cannot help but feel like I need to say I completely agree.

843
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
DDR hasn't changed drastically since Sixth Mix.

844
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
However, Seventh Mix is my favorite mix and will always be smile face.

845
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:11,000
The thing that made DDR so much fun to play was the cheesy dance mania pop that was in it.

846
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:16,000
After seeing the list of licensed songs in the arcade version of Supernova 2,

847
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,000
I have to say that I am not excited for it because a lot of it is shitty mainstream music.

848
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Linkin Park and DDR equals WTF.

849
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,000
The same goes for the home versions.

850
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Most casual gamers I know think Guitar Hero is the best rhythm game because it has real songs in it,

851
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:36,000
and when they heard that the home version of Supernova 2 had Britney Spears, Gwen Stefani, and Justin Timberlake,

852
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,000
they said Guitar Hero had good real music.

853
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:44,000
However, they also said that Captain Jack Harchin here is most of the other dance mania tracks for some of their favorite songs in DDR.

854
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:49,000
I don't think this crappy mainstream pop is appealing to anyone except for 12-year-old girls.

855
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Also, Rob, what innovations would you put in DDR because I've always been curious as to what they are.

856
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:59,000
One of my favorite things about DDR is the sheer simplicity of it so anybody could jump in and play.

857
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,000
I think too many changes might ruin that part of DDR.

858
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Well, I've said this a million times on the show, but I know you might be a newer listener or what have you.

859
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
We've been doing the show a long time, so it feels like a million,

860
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,000
but I think the best way they could innovate DDR is that right now the way DDR is,

861
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
it has a lot of cooperative modes in the game.

862
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,000
There's a lot of cooperative dancing, a lot of cooperative.

863
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
I think the way for DDR to innovate is to make it more of a competitive game,

864
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
and that way tournaments can be based more around the competition element.

865
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Now, yes, I understand there's Dance Magic in DDR Disney,

866
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:32,000
and I believe there was a mode similar to it in some of the later home versions that they did for DDR.

867
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:38,000
However, these versions have always been add-ons or tack-ons and not the focus of the game itself.

868
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:45,000
I think there ought to be some type of dance battle or something that the game could focus on,

869
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
to take in some ideas and innovating from that.

870
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Maybe even in one-player mode you do battle against the computer.

871
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Some of the games like Bust-A-Groove worked is that you were always battling somebody else

872
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
to see who was the better dancer.

873
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
And they did it better in the second one.

874
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Yeah, and I think that could be a new direction for DDR where they could innovate,

875
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,000
yet keep the core element of the game stomping on arrows the same.

876
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Second Mix had it.

877
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Dance battle.

878
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
It wasn't quite the same, though.

879
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
It's a start, but it's not.

880
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Those types of things have always been add-ons and not the focus of the game, if you know what I mean.

881
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
I still think there should be a single-player type of mode in there,

882
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
but I also agree about the music selections.

883
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Having some of the mainstream stuff is nice,

884
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
but I think the dance mania stuff is always where it was at.

885
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
And a different drum, too.

886
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Can't forget them.

887
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
But, boy, I really ruffled some feathers in my comments last week, though,

888
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
from some of the hardcore DDR people.

889
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
I've seen a few comments.

890
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Unfortunately, I stand by what I said.

891
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
I know it's tough to hear, but...

892
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Super DDR Fighter II Turbo.

893
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:51,000
It's time for DDR to innovate or go away.

894
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
I hate to say that, but...

895
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
God, it really pains me to say that, actually.

896
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
But if they're not going to innovate, I'm just not interested anymore.

897
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
They've got their market with those 12-year-old girls, though.

898
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Hooray.

899
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Well, they can enjoy it.

900
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Yeah, really.

901
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
That's it.

902
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
All right.

903
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Well, let's get back into some gaming news, then.

904
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
And we'll go to Loki.

905
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Anyways.

906
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
So we talked about this before.

907
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:18,000
God's already had it for a while now, but we finally just got it in time for Christmas.

908
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:25,000
You'll be able to send virtual console games to friends on your friends list,

909
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:29,000
barring that you have their Wii friend code.

910
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,000
But you can gift wonderful virtual console games.

911
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,000
So I'm sure once Guardian Legend comes out,

912
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:41,000
you'll have 30 copies of Guardian Legend coming to you from all your friends.

913
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
I have no problem with this.

914
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
No word, though, and I haven't heard about this before.

915
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
What happens if you already have the game?

916
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
I guess you're just out of luck.

917
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Perhaps.

918
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
I don't know.

919
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Or, well...

920
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:59,000
No, I want to say I have heard that what happens if you already have the game

921
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,000
is that you actually can't send the game to your friend.

922
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Like, when you try to gift it to them, it'll just bounce back and say,

923
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,000
you can't gift this because they already have it, or something along those lines.

924
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Well, then.

925
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,000
I can't guarantee that, though, but I'm pretty sure that's what I read.

926
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
So there you go.

927
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
If you're interested in doing this, it's just like buying a normal virtual console game,

928
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
which is when you're about to pay for it.

929
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,000
It will ask you if it's for yourself or for someone else.

930
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:28,000
If it's for someone else, you just specify who, and they'll take care of the rest.

931
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
There are some things you can gift for free.

932
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Like, you could send the photo channel version 1.1.

933
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,000
You could gift that to people, because even when you go in there,

934
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,000
I haven't tried it, but there's an option to either download or gift.

935
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:46,000
So if you're feeling cheap this Christmas, gift free things to your friends.

936
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
It's fun.

937
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
I like free.

938
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
I think you want to watch the Metroid channel.

939
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
The Metroid channel.

940
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,000
I would watch the Metroid channel if that were a real TV channel.

941
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Well, there is a little bit of news for people who like stuff on their iPhone,

942
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
and I'm...

943
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Is that like stuff on my cat?

944
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
No.

945
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
It's as in emulation.

946
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
They are in the beta state, well, near the beta stage, I should say,

947
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,000
for an iPhone PS1 emulator,

948
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:27,000
and it's called PSX number 4 iPhone emulator.

949
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:32,000
They're still working on it, but hopefully they'll have something out soon

950
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
for all of you who want to do it,

951
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:40,000
but their goal is to have it 75% compatible with all of the...

952
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Well, I'd have to say, compatible with 75% of the list of PS1 games that are out.

953
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,000
So, hey, that'd be nice, but you know what?

954
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,000
I'm not going to download it unless something that Apple puts out.

955
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,000
RastoUT in chat says, unless you can plug a controller in the iPhone,

956
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
do not want...

957
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Looking at the screen for this that they have on here,

958
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,000
and I'll go ahead and link that in the chat room,

959
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:12,000
they've got D-pads and your trigger buttons on the screen itself,

960
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:19,000
sort of running behind the game stuff itself,

961
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
so that still doesn't...

962
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,000
I don't think it's going to work, so...

963
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
I don't think that it'll be very playable.

964
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
The Nintendo one, I understand. It actually was okay.

965
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
The Nintendo one looks rad. If I had an iPhone, I'd do it, except for the fact that,

966
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,000
you know, then Apple will put the curse of death on my phone, probably.

967
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Yeah, I don't want to brick my phone.

968
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Well, exactly.

969
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
You already have the curse of death if you have an iPhone anyway, so...

970
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Shut up.

971
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,000
I haven't had a single problem with mine.

972
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Oh, shiz. All right, more news.

973
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Less Apple debate, more news.

974
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Anyways, let's see here.

975
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,000
There's going to be some new maps, apparently, for Team Fortress 2 coming,

976
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,000
as well as some more fixes, because you can't fix that game enough.

977
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,000
But that's kind of cool that they're having new maps, because I remember before,

978
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,000
they only had, like, what, three maps? So that kind of sucks.

979
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:13,000
But now, let's see here, they're talking about some different fixes

980
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:17,000
that they're going to be having, including several gameplay exploits,

981
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:22,000
plus other stuff to improve bandwidth usage and improve stats reporting,

982
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,000
and I guess some menu bugs.

983
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,000
I didn't really say, though, what the different levels are going to be yet,

984
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,000
but I'm sure we'll find that out soon, because I don't think it's officially been announced.

985
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Oh, my God, I do want this.

986
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,000
What are you freaking out about over there, Dark Soccer?

987
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:42,000
I was looking at Valve's website, and they have Aperture Science cups,

988
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,000
and I do want one.

989
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:50,000
It's funny, because, like, all the passion she had for DDR at one time,

990
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
she now has for Portal. It's amazing.

991
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
You know what would be fucking awesome?

992
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Like, you know how they have those stupid little light-sensored things,

993
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:04,000
like the stupid frogs and stuff that you walk in front of, and they ribbit at you and stuff?

994
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,000
They need one of those sentry guns or whatever, so when you walk past, it's all,

995
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Hello, who's there?

996
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:16,000
And do all that stuff, and pop up, and we need to make that happen.

997
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
That'd be pretty sweet.

998
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
All right, well, I've got a couple of stories for you guys.

999
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:23,000
One thing I want to say is that the Word of the Year has been released by Miriam Webster,

1000
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,000
and of course, Webster is the folks that make the dictionary, right?

1001
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Webster's Dictionary.

1002
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
They have released their Word of the Year,

1003
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:34,000
and the reason why this relates to gaming is that the Word of the Year is Woot.

1004
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:40,000
That's right, W-0-0-T, Woot, is the Word of the Year.

1005
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
I don't think I need to define what Woot means.

1006
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Most gamers know Woot is like a celebration thing,

1007
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
and I'm just thinking, I always think about Woot.com, too, the store.

1008
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
You know what they have?

1009
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
This is going to be great business for them,

1010
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
to be the guy that owns Woot.com right now.

1011
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,000
The runner-up, by the way, was Facebook, but using it as a verb,

1012
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
like you're going to Facebook somebody.

1013
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,000
But I always thought saying you were going to MySpace somebody

1014
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
was a more popular verb to use.

1015
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
I'd just say friend somebody.

1016
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Really?

1017
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Yeah, I think that's a good thing to say.

1018
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Turn a noun into a verb.

1019
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Exactly.

1020
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
All right, well, another story I've got for you guys real quick

1021
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:21,000
is that Fall 2008 is now the rumored time that Killzone 2

1022
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:25,000
and LittleBigPlanet are both supposed to be coming out.

1023
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,000
This was from a recent post on 3Speech, which, as you know,

1024
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
is the PlayStation blog.

1025
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,000
I guess it's kind of their major Nelson-ish thing.

1026
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
It's their semi-official official blog.

1027
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Semi-official, yeah.

1028
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Yeah, it's their blog.

1029
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,000
We're totally independent, but we're owned by something.

1030
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Apparently, LittleBigPlanet and Killzone 2 are not coming out

1031
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:45,000
until September or October next year.

1032
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,000
That's a pretty big difference from early 2008,

1033
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
which was the original time for LittleBigPlanet.

1034
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,000
But then again, pushback should be no new news to Sony,

1035
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
or really gaming in general.

1036
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
It wouldn't be fair to pick on Sony in that department.

1037
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Hello, Super Smash Bros. Brawl, right?

1038
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Yeah.

1039
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
But it just kind of sucks for sales because, again,

1040
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,000
without really, really killer applications,

1041
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:11,000
PlayStation 3s aren't going to move off-shells any faster.

1042
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Well, no, all the stuff that they're promising us,

1043
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,000
you know, that was supposed to be coming out so people would buy these systems.

1044
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,000
You know, I'm sure you've seen the trailers for,

1045
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,000
like, the third-party stuff that they have for PlayStation 3 now,

1046
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,000
where they're advertising Metal Gear Solid 4 like it's out right now,

1047
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,000
even though it doesn't come out until, what, like, shit,

1048
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
I don't even know if they have an official announcement.

1049
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
A long time.

1050
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Yeah, probably, like, March-ish, so.

1051
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Quick clarifications from our chat room.

1052
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,000
RasteelUT says three speeches Sony Europe,

1053
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Sony USA is PlayStation.blog.

1054
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Well, fine.

1055
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
But it's still Sony, no matter what country you're in.

1056
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Well, if that's the case, then who knows, you know,

1057
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,000
a little big planet in Killzone being delayed to, like, the fall, you know,

1058
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Europe's always getting the shaft.

1059
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
That's true.

1060
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Europe always gets the shaft in that department,

1061
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,000
but I don't know, even, that's a long shaft,

1062
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,000
if they're not getting them until the end of the year,

1063
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
and we're getting them at the beginning of the year.

1064
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Well, here's the thing I want to note.

1065
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,000
I'm not sure if SingStar is already out now in Europe.

1066
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,000
I know it's not here for the PlayStation 3 at least.

1067
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Maybe they're just having trouble with, like,

1068
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
the network infrastructure or something like that,

1069
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,000
because, you know, those things like Home, you know,

1070
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,000
SingStar, this little big planet and stuff

1071
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
that's going to have a lot of, like, you know,

1072
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,000
network backend stuff is not coming out.

1073
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Is it sad that I kind of sort of want a PlayStation 3 for SingStar?

1074
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Yes, it is sad.

1075
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Seeing as there's countless versions for the PlayStation 2,

1076
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
why the fuck do you need the PlayStation 3?

1077
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Because of the whole, like, I know my friends.

1078
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Oh, because you can upload videos to YouTube.

1079
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Yes, and I want to do that to my friends.

1080
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,000
I want to upload videos, you know, to any other site.

1081
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
It's just like uploading videos to YouTube.

1082
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Well, how about this?

1083
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Why don't you actually upload videos to YouTube?

1084
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Guess what? It's free to do that.

1085
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Instead of having to buy a game.

1086
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Oh, fine. Shut up.

1087
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Actually, it's...

1088
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Why don't you buy, you know, fucking SingStar right now,

1089
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
because, hell, you get the microphones.

1090
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
They work with the PlayStation 3.

1091
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Sephiroth1215 says,

1092
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Rob, just play Rock Band.

1093
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Ironically enough, I was playing Rock Band last night.

1094
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
One of my friends was filming me,

1095
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,000
and I wouldn't be surprised if that shit ended up on MySpace TV,

1096
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
or YouTube, or any of that stuff,

1097
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,000
but I hope not, because I look like an idiot when I play Rock Band.

1098
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Especially the singing.

1099
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
I was horrible.

1100
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Horrible, because none of those songs are in my key.

1101
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
I would just like to share.

1102
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
I remember you singing something in karaoke

1103
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,000
that was completely out of your key that you did, because I asked you to.

1104
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
I got to interrupt the show real quick.

1105
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Fine.

1106
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
But this is talking about Rock Band.

1107
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Irene doing sabotage.

1108
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Oh, my God.

1109
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
I hope that's on video somewhere,

1110
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,000
because that could possibly be funnier than the I'm staying in

1111
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
that you did a long time ago.

1112
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
That was so funny.

1113
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,000
It was hard to play the drums and listen to that.

1114
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,000
She's fucking hardcore. I love it.

1115
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Now, what were you going to say?

1116
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,000
You sang Birdhouse in Your Soul for me.

1117
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
I love that song.

1118
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Half of it's in my key.

1119
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
All right.

1120
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
You did a good job on it, I have to say.

1121
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
But anyway.

1122
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
We should go to karaoke again sometime.

1123
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Let's go, although I won't sing.

1124
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
That's fine.

1125
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
We can drink.

1126
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,000
I hope that that one guy, though, who has that really, really good voice

1127
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:16,000
that sang Always and Forever is there.

1128
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Let's go, and I can sing, and you can drink.

1129
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Okay, that means you drive.

1130
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Fair enough.

1131
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
All right, moving on, news.

1132
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Okay.

1133
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Actually, this is sort of...

1134
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Well, it's old news if they're on your DeviantArt friends list,

1135
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:37,000
but UdonKru has been working on new Street Fighter comics,

1136
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
and they have been for quite some time.

1137
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:43,000
In 2008, there's a Street Fighter II Turbo comic that is to be out,

1138
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:47,000
and I really, really love the work that UdonKru has done on this.

1139
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
They're also bringing out, though,

1140
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:54,000
a lot of the different comics that are from overseas,

1141
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,000
but they're also doing a Street Fighter Legends one

1142
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:03,000
that's different focus comics on different ones.

1143
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:11,000
They're also doing one for Street Fighter III.

1144
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:17,000
They're also bringing out some of the other collections that came out overseas,

1145
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:21,000
like they've been doing Sakura Ganbaru,

1146
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,000
which I read a long time ago in scans,

1147
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:28,000
but it's pretty cool.

1148
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,000
All righty.

1149
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Pretty cool.

1150
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Yeah, you can also go on DeviantArt,

1151
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:39,000
and you can add Udon to your friends list,

1152
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
and I'll get the name in a sec.

1153
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
All right.

1154
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Let's see here.

1155
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Now, there's some interesting news coming out about Grand Theft Auto IV.

1156
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:52,000
They've rated it in Australia already, MA15+,

1157
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
which is good for two reasons.

1158
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,000
One, it's not going to be adults only over there, at least,

1159
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,000
and I know a lot of games get banned in Australia.

1160
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Two, the fact that it's actually been rated, first off,

1161
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,000
may indicate that it's actually coming out soon,

1162
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,000
and possibly within the time frame that they had originally said,

1163
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
which was April,

1164
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,000
although the other thing, 3Speech, I believe,

1165
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,000
said that Grand Theft Auto IV was coming out around the same time

1166
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,000
as Killzone 2 and LittleBigPlanet,

1167
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
so I hope that's not true.

1168
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:27,000
I hope it's actually coming out before holiday 2008.

1169
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Go spring release.

1170
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Come on.

1171
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:33,000
I need to play this game.

1172
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
I found it, by the way.

1173
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
What's that?

1174
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
It's udoncrew.deviantart.com.

1175
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
I heard it is.

1176
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:42,000
I find a lot of their art wallets in progress, too.

1177
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Well, save the last minute stories.

1178
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
That is going to do it for our news tonight,

1179
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
and you know what that means.

1180
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
It's time to open up the telephones

1181
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,000
and let you guys have a say.

1182
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,000
If you'd like to give us a call, it's 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1183
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

1184
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
We've been doing the Skype thing for a long time.

1185
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Of course, Skype is a free program

1186
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
that allows you to call us using your computer if you have a headset.

1187
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
However, if you are going to use Skype,

1188
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
I encourage you, if you've never called the show before,

1189
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:09,000
please call ECHO123 on Skype first,

1190
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
because that way you can test your connection,

1191
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,000
and when you call us, you don't sound like shite.

1192
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
But in the meantime, we have a call, and let's take that call.

1193
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

1194
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Who's this?

1195
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
It's Ronbo. How are you guys doing tonight?

1196
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Good, Ronbo. How are you doing, my friend?

1197
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Good, good, good.

1198
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Last week I went to my final anime con of the year,

1199
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
and I have some gaming stuffs for you.

1200
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Really? You got me stuffs?

1201
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Yeah, I mean, just some gaming information.

1202
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,000
It's not much, because I was working the whole weekend,

1203
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
because my roommate has a company now,

1204
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:44,000
so I was helping him peddle his wares.

1205
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Cool. Well, what kind of stuffs?

1206
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Well, first off, I was talking to a couple of people

1207
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,000
that were running the gaming room at New York Anime Fest,

1208
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
and things were a little bit different.

1209
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:59,000
They wanted to be different from normal gaming rooms,

1210
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:02,000
so there was no Bimani there this year,

1211
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:07,000
including no rock band or guitar hero or anything like that.

1212
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Good for them taking a stand, because honestly,

1213
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
most of the people that go to those cons

1214
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,000
have all that shit at home, don't they?

1215
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Pretty much.

1216
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
So there you go.

1217
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:21,000
They had more anime-based games and other RPGs and stuff,

1218
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
but there were a couple of instances

1219
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:27,000
that did happen in the gaming room from what I was told.

1220
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:33,000
A DS got stolen with a game that was in development,

1221
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,000
and some other guy tried to steal another DS,

1222
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
but he got caught doing it.

1223
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Aw, you know that DS game in development's

1224
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
going to be up on the internet any day now.

1225
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Probably you're already up there.

1226
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
I don't even know which game it was.

1227
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Interesting.

1228
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Also, while I was there,

1229
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
I was working for a couple other websites,

1230
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,000
and one of my friends runs a site called Gaming Angels,

1231
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,000
so I was running around getting pictures

1232
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:02,000
of female cosplayers doing gaming stuffs.

1233
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,000
I could tell you the most popular gaming cosplayers

1234
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:10,000
pretty much was Yuna from Final Fantasy X and Final Fantasy X-2.

1235
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
That's kind of not a surprise.

1236
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:16,000
I've seen a lot of Yunas of all shapes and sizes at anime cons.

1237
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Pretty much.

1238
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Here's a picture I'm about to post in the chat room

1239
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
of something interesting.

1240
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:25,000
There's one girl I met who did Lolita Link for Legend of Zelda.

1241
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Lolita Link?

1242
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Yep, Lolita Link.

1243
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
I just posted a link in the chat.

1244
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,000
This I have to see.

1245
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Yeah, that was great.

1246
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
That's interesting.

1247
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Yay, Slutty Link.

1248
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:43,000
This next picture is for you.

1249
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Since this is horrible radio, when you send pictures,

1250
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
describe for our listeners what you're sending.

1251
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:53,000
The second picture is a person cosplaying night.

1252
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Nice.

1253
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
I did see that one.

1254
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
That's cute.

1255
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:02,000
This next one is a picture of a prize that you probably enjoyed

1256
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
when I sent it to your cell phone.

1257
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:10,000
This is my friend dressed up as Pit from Smash Bros. Ball.

1258
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,000
I got a random text message from Rama over the weekend

1259
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
with a lady dressed as Pit.

1260
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
That's hardcore, though.

1261
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,000
I like that.

1262
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Good for her.

1263
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
I hope she wants something.

1264
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,000
I'm not sure, but I can always ask because she's a good friend of mine.

1265
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,000
I know Jamie is a big fan of Silent Hill,

1266
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,000
so I found the girl who did Pyramid Head.

1267
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,000
That's cool, yeah.

1268
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:37,000
The last two pictures, I got to say, are my personal favorites.

1269
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,000
You like Final Fight?

1270
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Oh, yeah.

1271
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,000
I've got almost every version that they put out at home.

1272
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Well, there's this guy walking around with a shirt that says,

1273
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,000
I got OA on the front.

1274
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:52,000
And on the back, it says, and I quote,

1275
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:56,000
a turkey in every horror drum and a fist in every face.

1276
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Yes.

1277
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,000
That was great.

1278
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:03,000
That's great.

1279
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:06,000
I like how it's just some dude wearing this shirt like,

1280
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
yeah, I got my Haggar OA shirt.

1281
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
A turkey in every oil drum and a fist in every face.

1282
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:14,000
That's amazing.

1283
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,000
I want that shirt.

1284
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,000
He should market that.

1285
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Some other folks in chat are saying they want that shirt, too.

1286
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
That shirt is fantastic.

1287
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Well, since the pictures are posted,

1288
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
maybe I'll end up hearing from the guy.

1289
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
I could find out more information about the shirt.

1290
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:30,000
I have a feeling he made it himself, which is pretty damn cool.

1291
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
You know, I was just thinking, you know, at Orange Lawns Radio,

1292
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
we should open a t-shirt shop and not just sell official

1293
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Orange Lawns Radio t-shirts like finally,

1294
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,000
but really funny gamer nerd shirts such as that.

1295
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Now, I mean, obviously we wouldn't steal that idea,

1296
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,000
but we could come up with other things that are just as funny, right?

1297
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Like, we should get a shirt that says,

1298
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Rate Me Pyramid Head on it,

1299
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:50,000
with a little chibi pyramid head on it.

1300
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,000
I mean, I'd wear that in public, wouldn't you?

1301
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,000
I definitely would.

1302
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,000
See?

1303
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
I ran across this shirt this weekend that said,

1304
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Mario, Luigi, oh, wait.

1305
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,000
And by the way, patent pending on the Rate Me Pyramid Head shirt.

1306
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:06,000
If you steal that idea, I'll sue you for a million dollars.

1307
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,000
We have it. We have proof.

1308
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
It's being recorded.

1309
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Exactly.

1310
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,000
All right.

1311
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Well, Rahm, anything else you want to share with our listeners?

1312
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
I'm glad to hear you had fun at the con.

1313
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,000
I'm glad.

1314
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:19,000
That's pretty much it, and we want the New York chapter of OLR.

1315
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
I want you guys to come out to Anime Next,

1316
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:24,000
and we're working with some friends to try to get you guys out here.

1317
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
When is that?

1318
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:29,000
I believe it's the first or second weekend of June.

1319
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,000
They just announced their date.

1320
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Just in time for my birthday.

1321
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Hey, if you make it out for your birthday, we'll take you out.

1322
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:38,000
I mean, I celebrate my birthday with you guys for fun,

1323
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,000
and it's only fair, you know?

1324
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
And speaking of which, are you coming back this year?

1325
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:45,000
Because I do believe we were promised Rama in 08.

1326
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
I thought I said 09.

1327
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,000
I think it was 09.

1328
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,000
Every other year.

1329
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
I was trying to switch it up.

1330
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,000
I'm sorry.

1331
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
All right.

1332
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Have a good one, Rama.

1333
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Thanks for calling.

1334
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,000
All right, you guys take care.

1335
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Bye-bye.

1336
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Bye.

1337
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:02,000
DMN says Roberts and Summers in 08 would be the ticket.

1338
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
I don't know what that leaves Loki to do.

1339
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Loki would have to be the official...

1340
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
He'd be Secretary of State.

1341
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Well, he's court jester.

1342
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,000
He is what he is.

1343
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:13,000
He can be Speaker of the House.

1344
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:17,000
Actually, he can be the pet at the White House, like Socks the Cat.

1345
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,000
We have Loki.

1346
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,000
I don't know.

1347
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Anyway, we've got another caller.

1348
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Jeremy!

1349
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,000
All right, fine.

1350
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Jeremy is the official pet.

1351
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Let me get to the caller.

1352
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Hi, you're on Orange House Radio.

1353
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Who's this?

1354
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,000
GS68.

1355
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Oh my God, GS68.

1356
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
You've been on the show in many ways tonight.

1357
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Now you're calling us when you were already on the mailbag?

1358
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,000
It's all good.

1359
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,000
What's up?

1360
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:41,000
First of all, I thought the ferret was the official pet of the caller.

1361
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Good point.

1362
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,000
The ferret...

1363
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,000
We don't know where the ferret is.

1364
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:47,000
The ferret will not stab you in the face and in fact cannot speak.

1365
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
The ferret is MIA.

1366
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
And now we should sell shirts with ferrets on them.

1367
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,000
And it's just a ferret.

1368
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Actually, I think I've seen that before.

1369
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Never mind, we can't do that.

1370
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
I don't want to get sued.

1371
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,000
What's on your mind?

1372
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,000
Certainly you have something game-related.

1373
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Yeah, today I went to the GameStop Tournament Edition, which is what I like to call it.

1374
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Oh, you've been to the new place that we were talking about earlier in the program.

1375
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,000
What was it like?

1376
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
What was up with it?

1377
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:20,000
First, there's a bottle of kiosks over there where you can play games and such.

1378
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Over in the house where you normally buy games and stuff, they also have a bunch of kiosks over there.

1379
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:36,000
Now, did it look like a normal GameStop otherwise, with just a bunch of additional kiosks?

1380
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Well, actually, no, because they have this big stage where there's a whole bunch of gaming kiosks.

1381
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:50,000
And I presume that's for tournaments and stuff.

1382
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Interesting.

1383
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:55,000
I was going to ask about, was something going on?

1384
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Were they actually doing a tournament when you were there today, or was it just kind of open?

1385
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,000
Actually, no.

1386
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,000
It was a regular day.

1387
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
So what did they do during the regular day?

1388
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Are they just open for people to play games for free?

1389
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
Yeah, I guess.

1390
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
Wow. That's kind of cool.

1391
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:18,000
Yes, I was driving down to Stevens Creek, and what caught my attention was the subtitle under the GameStop logo by Barnes & Noble.

1392
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Where exactly is this GameStop located?

1393
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:27,000
It's on the corner of San Tomas Expressway and Stevens Creek Boulevard in San Jose.

1394
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Oh, shit, I know where that is. That's funny.

1395
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Huh.

1396
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:35,000
I might have to check that out at some point, because I go to, it's right next to the Barnes & Noble.

1397
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Yeah, I kind of know where that is. I go down that area quite often.

1398
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:44,000
I go to Menlo Park almost every other week, so I might have to check that out. Very cool.

1399
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:49,000
All right, well, anything else you want to share with our listeners after your trip today?

1400
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,000
No.

1401
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:54,000
All right, well, have a good one, and thanks for the first-hand report from being down there.

1402
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Thanks, you too.

1403
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
All right, take care.

1404
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:02,000
If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR. Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

1405
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Keep in mind that the 877 number is toll-free, but only for those folks in the U.S. and Canada.

1406
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:10,000
I know we have listeners overseas. The 877 won't work for you, but you can use Skype.

1407
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Skype is international, and it's free.

1408
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:17,000
While we wait for some calls, how about some last-minute stories? Anybody, last-minute story?

1409
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
I like fire.

1410
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,000
That's not news.

1411
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Well, there's apparently a possibility that an 18-plus version of No More Heroes may actually happen in the future for Europe,

1412
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:32,000
so fear not. You may get your uncut version of the game.

1413
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:36,000
There's a funny little Wiimote candy dispenser that's out there now.

1414
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:43,000
If you go to candyaddict.com, you can buy a Wiimote candy dispenser.

1415
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Perfect gift for those kids who may not be able to get a Wii this Christmas.

1416
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Give them an IOU and a Wii candy dispenser.

1417
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,000
What a shitty alternative.

1418
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Let's go to the phones. We have another call.

1419
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

1420
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Hello, this is RosteelUT.

1421
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:01,000
Hello, RosteelUT. What is on your mind?

1422
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Hello.

1423
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Not much. I was just looking at the November NPDs a few days ago,

1424
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:14,000
and it's pretty damn shocking to see how well some of these games have turned out.

1425
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Call of Duty 4 has just been ridiculous.

1426
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
There's been a lot of sales.

1427
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:24,000
The one thing that's been on my mind, and I mentioned this earlier in the chat,

1428
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:28,000
is that it's great that the Wii is selling all this hardware,

1429
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
but is it really growing a market?

1430
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:35,000
You look at all these games that are found, there's a lot of good third-party games.

1431
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:43,000
It's not like there's nothing on there, but it's like nothing is found on a market.

1432
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:46,000
The thing that gets to me is are these people ever going to buy games,

1433
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:51,000
or is it just going to be the same people buying the same four games over and over again?

1434
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:55,000
I think there are a shitload of people that are buying the system just for Wii Sports,

1435
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:58,000
because that's the game that Nintendo's been very good at getting out there

1436
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
and creating a fad out of.

1437
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Think about the way most people think about video games in their mind.

1438
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:11,000
A lot of folks don't even realize that this thing is a system capable of playing a multitude of games,

1439
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:14,000
but the way that it's been marketed to the soccer moms and everything is,

1440
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:18,000
as Wii Sports, get up and move your butt while you play games.

1441
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Play fake tennis and all that stuff.

1442
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:24,000
They've done an amazing job in that regard.

1443
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:28,000
The question is, I mentioned Zack and Wiki in the chat.

1444
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:31,000
I mentioned more heroes.

1445
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Even Rayman 2 has been doing pretty well, but not anywhere near as good as the first one,

1446
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:40,000
which was launch titles, and launch titles always have a lucky streak.

1447
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:46,000
If all we're getting is people buying it for Wii Sports,

1448
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:51,000
is it ever going to be anything more than just a toy, basically?

1449
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:55,000
Is it ever going to be anything that anyone who actually wants more than one game is going to want to have?

1450
01:04:55,000 --> 01:05:00,000
I do, because I think Nintendo is going to try to make Wii Fit the next fad.

1451
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:04,000
My gut tells me, the way Nintendo's been going with the market lately,

1452
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:07,000
I think they are really going to try and make Wii Fit massive.

1453
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:13,000
They're going to try and get it out there on the Today Show and on Oprah and all that shit,

1454
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:17,000
and that's going to be their next thing that they're going to push and try to get in every home.

1455
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:20,000
I expect Wii Fit to do well.

1456
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:23,000
All these stupid little fitness products always do well.

1457
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:29,000
The question I'm asking is, you see the 360s, and even the PS3 to some extent.

1458
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:32,000
The PS3 has you good selling games this month.

1459
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Is it ever going to be whether Wii is a vibrant market,

1460
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:43,000
or is it just going to continue to be hostile to everybody who was Nintendo?

1461
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:47,000
That's the real question.

1462
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:50,000
You mentioned, of course, movie games and all that,

1463
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:56,000
but a lot of people don't even look at the movie games.

1464
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
It's shocking.

1465
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Even traditional high-selling games.

1466
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:04,000
I was talking to this guy a couple of weeks ago.

1467
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:10,000
EA butted heads with Nintendo so they could put the 32 multiplayer online in Medal of Honor Heroes 2.

1468
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:17,000
They had the Madden online for 08 where it works with EA Nation instead of the friend codes,

1469
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
and they're not being rewarded.

1470
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:23,000
The third parties are trying, some of them.

1471
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:28,000
Of course, no more Heroes is a tragedy.

1472
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Has that even been released here yet?

1473
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
It was released in Japan.

1474
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:38,000
Kotaku had a piece on it a couple of weeks ago,

1475
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:43,000
where Suda51 actually went to a huge game store in Akihabara.

1476
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Nobody went there.

1477
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
He was going to go sign games.

1478
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:49,000
They had piles of toilet paper that you could buy or get for free.

1479
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
Yeah, they were giving the toilet paper away.

1480
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
They had a model.

1481
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:57,000
It was a big launch event and nobody came.

1482
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:01,000
That just made me sad, really.

1483
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,000
It's not just that game.

1484
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
It's Zack and Wiki.

1485
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:07,000
One of my favorite games, Mercury Meltdown Revolution.

1486
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
I don't think that sold very well.

1487
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:10,000
Look at the box art for that game.

1488
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:14,000
That isn't something that really jumps out at you as something you should buy.

1489
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,000
What, Zack and Wiki?

1490
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:18,000
No, the Mercury Meltdown Revolution.

1491
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Yeah, Mercury Meltdown.

1492
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
I could see you with Mercury Meltdown.

1493
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:27,000
But Zack and Wiki, that screams family friendly.

1494
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:30,000
It's a very adorable looking game.

1495
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:33,000
It's not that hard.

1496
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:41,000
Yeah, Capcom could have advertised it better, but given the ridiculous sales of this system,

1497
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:46,000
you'd think that more games would just sell on accident, considering how many of these

1498
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,000
systems there are.

1499
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:51,000
One thing the NPD doesn't account for, though, that I'd be curious to know a little more

1500
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:54,000
is the virtual console sales.

1501
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:59,000
I bet that's doing crazy business that if we saw the numbers, we'd get sick over the

1502
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
fact that how many games people might use a cheaper...

1503
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:05,000
Well, Nintendo mentioned that they made $33 million on the virtual console, which isn't

1504
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,000
bad, considering.

1505
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,000
I mean, shit.

1506
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:10,000
That's not bad at all.

1507
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:17,000
I would be very interested, considering how much of a hassle it is with the Wii to get

1508
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:22,000
online sometimes, at least with the wireless, I do not understand why they didn't have an

1509
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,000
Ethernet port right there.

1510
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,000
I don't understand that.

1511
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:30,000
That $33 million is literally free money to them, is literally free money right out of

1512
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,000
thin air.

1513
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Of course.

1514
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,000
It's all old games.

1515
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:38,000
I mean, granted, they have to write those manuals and do the QA testing and all that

1516
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:42,000
stuff, but that's pennies compared to the bigger picture, you know what I mean?

1517
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:46,000
I'm sure a skill programmer could do that in an hour.

1518
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:52,000
That's my concern, because I have all three systems.

1519
01:08:52,000 --> 01:09:02,440
I want Nintendo to be successful, but I don't want a system that nobody's buying games for

1520
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:09,760
eventually taking the rest of the industry down with it, because you see the trends.

1521
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:14,880
You see more of these little minigame crap coming out, and personally, I don't blame

1522
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:18,680
the third parties, because if they're not going to get big sales, they may as well go for

1523
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:20,680
the quick buck.

1524
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:30,880
But that could end up hurting the Wii after the Wii Sports fat is done or if the Wii Fit

1525
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:35,360
doesn't work very well here.

1526
01:09:35,360 --> 01:09:39,440
Nintendo is riding on the real thin ground if they don't at least try to get the quality

1527
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:46,440
control up and try to help people realize, hey, this thing has other games.

1528
01:09:46,440 --> 01:09:48,440
Mario Galaxy didn't do as well in Japan.

1529
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:50,440
What the hell?

1530
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:54,480
That is a little bit surprising.

1531
01:09:54,480 --> 01:10:02,120
I thought Mario Galaxy was going to do a million in a week, honestly, because it's Mario.

1532
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:03,680
It's freaking Mario.

1533
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:08,080
Anyways, I've been ranting too long, and I'm sure a whole lot of people want to get on

1534
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:10,080
the line, so I'll see you next week, all right?

1535
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:11,080
All right.

1536
01:10:11,080 --> 01:10:12,080
We've got to let you go anyway for time, but take care, buddy.

1537
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:13,080
Thanks for the phone.

1538
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:14,080
You're doing fine.

1539
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:15,080
Bye-bye.

1540
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:16,080
Bye-bye.

1541
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:17,080
All right.

1542
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:18,080
I think that's actually going to do it for calls tonight, because we're running a little

1543
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:20,920
bit long tonight, so we're going to go ahead and start to wrap up the program.

1544
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:24,400
I do want to check and see if there's any more last-minute stories.

1545
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:26,160
Yeah.

1546
01:10:26,160 --> 01:10:27,160
Let's see here real quick.

1547
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:30,440
I was just going to mention a few things that were kind of funny.

1548
01:10:30,440 --> 01:10:35,480
There's actually a game coming out in Europe, and this is really sad, called MTV Fan Attack,

1549
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:45,800
and it looks like you're a VJ running from fans, interesting, wonderful shit, and then

1550
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:49,720
this will piss off my wife really bad.

1551
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:55,080
Her big complaint, you remember, Rob, you probably remember her complaint about this,

1552
01:10:55,080 --> 01:10:56,840
the Golden Compass movie.

1553
01:10:56,840 --> 01:11:00,060
Apparently, the ending was not like the book.

1554
01:11:00,060 --> 01:11:07,120
There's a major scene that's cut out of the movie, not to give away any spoilers, but

1555
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:08,120
I will.

1556
01:11:08,120 --> 01:11:13,880
Apparently, a kid gets killed or sacrificed to open a portal.

1557
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:19,600
Hey, if that wasn't a portal, that would make the game even better, sacrificing bratty kids,

1558
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:24,880
but apparently that footage, though, is in the game if you finish the game, so I will

1559
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:28,560
have to show this to her tonight, and I'm sure a director's cut of the movie will be

1560
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:34,320
in order.

1561
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:38,320
Anything else from Last Minute News Tonight?

1562
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:41,520
No, that's a Famitsu cover.

1563
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:49,520
That's kind of funny for No More Heroes, and then they have a new wallpaper up on the No

1564
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:53,880
More Heroes website, which this will now be my new wallpaper, if Rob would want to take

1565
01:11:53,880 --> 01:12:01,720
a look here with him charging his beam saber.

1566
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:06,080
Dark Soccer, do you have anything last minute for us?

1567
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:07,080
I like pie.

1568
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:10,080
That's not a spoiler.

1569
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:11,080
No.

1570
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:12,080
All right.

1571
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:18,560
Anyhow, let's go around and get final thoughts for our program, because we're going to wrap

1572
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:20,400
this up and call it a week.

1573
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:22,280
Loki, your final thought?

1574
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:25,680
I hope we can fix my computer situation early.

1575
01:12:25,680 --> 01:12:30,680
I actually thought of something during the show that I need to check on, because my power

1576
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:34,040
supply apparently has a turbo mode on it, and a normal mode.

1577
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:39,520
The normal mode has the 12 volt rail broken up into four different rails, whereas turbo

1578
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:44,720
has it on one, and I'm wondering if I maybe switch that if it'll work, although I still

1579
01:12:44,720 --> 01:12:49,080
think that the motherboard or graphics card is broken, so we'll see.

1580
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:54,200
I get to play tons of games this week, taking Wednesday through Friday off to play games.

1581
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:57,280
My final thought is I have a two and a half week vacation coming up.

1582
01:12:57,280 --> 01:13:01,320
I just have to get through one more week of work to get there, and I'm so excited, and

1583
01:13:01,320 --> 01:13:05,880
I'm going to play a lot of games too, and I'm going to work on Orange Lawn's radio stuffs,

1584
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:06,880
which will be fun.

1585
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:07,880
Jamie, your final thought?

1586
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:13,840
I need to get Orange Box on PC so I can use the editor to put the Half-Life 2 maps in

1587
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:16,960
Portal and use the Portal gun in Half-Life.

1588
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:18,360
Fun.

1589
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:19,360
You get to work on that.

1590
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:20,360
All right.

1591
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:21,360
Eventually.

1592
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:22,360
Eventually.

1593
01:13:22,360 --> 01:13:26,600
All right, well, thank you very much for tuning into our program tonight and supporting independent

1594
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:28,040
podcasting and independent radio.

1595
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:29,040
We really appreciate it.

1596
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:32,760
Remember, if you like our show, tell two people you know about the program.

1597
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:36,600
That way, we slowly begin to take over the world as more and more people discover our

1598
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:37,600
little program.

1599
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:42,400
Remember, there will be no live show next week with us on December 23rd.

1600
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:48,200
There will be something for the live listeners on the stream with some of our other OLR personalities,

1601
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:50,520
but Dark Soccer and myself and Loki will have the night off.

1602
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:55,760
So we will see you back on the podcast on December 30th for the year-end review show.

1603
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:56,760
So see you then.

1604
01:13:56,760 --> 01:13:57,760
Bye-bye.

1605
01:13:57,760 --> 01:13:58,760
