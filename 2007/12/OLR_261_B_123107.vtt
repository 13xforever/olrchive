Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.

00:06.000 --> 00:15.000
To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.

00:15.000 --> 00:19.000
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

00:22.000 --> 00:26.000
Here on this New Year's Eve Eve, we are taping December 30, 2007.

00:26.000 --> 00:32.000
We're doing our year-end special, and in the first half of tonight's program, part A, we recapped with some of our listeners.

00:32.000 --> 00:35.000
We had Raven's Dolphin, we had Dark Knight, we had Xenocore.

00:35.000 --> 00:39.000
They all called in to talk about January, February, March, April, May, and June.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.000
We recapped those months.

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
We're going to be getting into the rest of the year very soon.

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
But first, let's open up the old mailbag.

00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
Dark Soccer is going to be opening up the old mailbag and pulling out some of her favorite emails.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
Do I gotta?

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
Yeah, you gotta.

00:53.000 --> 00:57.000
Because even though usually during a special show we wouldn't do it since we weren't here last week,

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
the email's building up and we gotta clean some of them out.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
I had to pick up a few.

01:01.000 --> 01:07.000
Yeah, and unfortunately, I mean, I think there was just so many emails these past two weeks that you're just not going to be able to read them all.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
So, Jamie's having to be choosy this week.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
Sorry, folks.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
So, let's open up the old mailbag.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
Mailbag at www.orangeloungeradio.com, though, if you want to send it.

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
Even if we don't always respond to them on air, we read them all.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
I go in there and I read them all every day.

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
There was one that had a lot of gratuitous uses of the word fuck, so I'm not reading it.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
I see.

01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
So, I'm only reading a few of these, okay?

01:28.000 --> 01:33.000
First one is, hey guys, greetings and salutations from Dr. Noir from Mexico City.

01:33.000 --> 01:38.000
I'll skip the praise because I obviously like your show a lot else I wouldn't be writing this.

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
I want to share with you an image that I'm sure will bring tears to many.

01:41.000 --> 01:47.000
Some in anger, some in grief at seeing this many Wii units waiting for a lonely four home for this Christmas.

01:47.000 --> 01:51.000
It's like watching a buffet and knowing people are famished elsewhere.

01:51.000 --> 01:56.000
Anyway, keep it up and please reply with a postal address to send you your holiday gifts.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
That'd be Rob.

01:58.000 --> 02:04.000
Don't move that email out. Save it in there and I'll reply with the address.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
Also, there's a PS.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
Oh, okay.

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
The plural form of luchador is not luchadores, but luchadores.

02:11.000 --> 02:15.000
With the last syllable pronounced S as in fez, the hat.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
All right.

02:17.000 --> 02:21.000
I did want to say speaking of gifts sent to us, one of our listeners, you'll love her,

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
Misty sent a little care package.

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
You can see up on the wall there's a Hello Kitty popsicle there.

02:27.000 --> 02:33.000
This little penguin eye dog thing, which I thought was too cute, and lots of rice candy, which is my favorite.

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
I ate it.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
She sent us some candy, but you eat it.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
But I eat it.

02:40.000 --> 02:47.000
Well, speaking of Misty, I'll go ahead and read her. She actually did ask about me talking about the Happy Suicide song.

02:47.000 --> 02:53.000
And it's Thanatos from End of Evangelion is the one I was referring to.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
The song that's just so freaking depressing.

02:56.000 --> 03:02.000
Oh, I thought it was the whole end scene where they're dying. It was hilarious.

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
Oh, yeah.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
But to read Misty's big email.

03:08.000 --> 03:13.000
So I was listening to my old OLR episodes and got stuck for some reason on episode 242.

03:13.000 --> 03:18.000
And that umbrella song that I ended up ripping from 249, but let's not go there right now, LOL.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
Excuse me.

03:20.000 --> 03:26.000
I guess what inspired me to write in again, well, this time anyway, was the short text message email that you read in this episode.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
Plus, I do have a question.

03:28.000 --> 03:33.000
I know I shouldn't necessarily be thinking this far ahead, but they said ASIN is my other addiction, aside from the station.

03:33.000 --> 03:37.000
I know enough not to ask if there will be a panel, though that would be fucking rad.

03:37.000 --> 03:41.000
So instead, I'll ask this. Currently, does anyone's schedule work out for ASIN?

03:41.000 --> 03:49.000
It's May 16th through 18th this year, but I am to head up to Rosemont on the 15th.

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
Also, should I expect to see Chris there?

03:52.000 --> 03:56.000
I didn't catch her last year. Feel free to insert lame Pokeman's jokes here.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
But I really want to see her in Megsy.

03:58.000 --> 04:08.000
Okay, I'll leave you alone for now. Sorry if there's a typo I missed, but my typing on the LG Envy still sucks a bit anyway. Heart misty.

04:08.000 --> 04:18.000
I would think very much that Chris is going to be there, seeing as how she's relocating, because I get to go with her on the trip.

04:18.000 --> 04:27.000
ASIN probably is not in my future, although a little bit more of my time in that year has been freed up.

04:27.000 --> 04:31.000
So, I don't know. I would love to go, but...

04:31.000 --> 04:41.000
I'm not saying no yet. Not likely right now, just due to the fact that I'm not going to have a lot of free time off work available, because I'm going to Mendocino in April.

04:41.000 --> 04:50.000
But never say never, because I have found that flights from here to Chicago, there's actually a lot of direct flights from SAC to Chicago, so you never know.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
And that's where ASIN's at, Chicago, right?

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
I do believe so.

04:53.000 --> 05:02.000
So, maybe. And that's more favorable maybe than you might think, because, you know, why not? It might be fun.

05:02.000 --> 05:09.000
Especially, I'll tell you what, that maybe is a hell of a lot more likely to become a yes, if we can somehow get in on getting a panel there or something.

05:09.000 --> 05:13.000
Well, I've got other stuff planned in May, and I have to double check my schedule.

05:13.000 --> 05:19.000
But I've wanted to go to ASIN now for a couple years, and I want to cosplay.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
I need a new costume.

05:22.000 --> 05:29.000
Probably all three of us won't make it, but at least maybe if one of the three of us can get out there. I don't know, Loki, trip to Chicago in your future?

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
Nope.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
The wife won't let you go, will she?

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
Yep, I'm chained to the house, I'm like on house arrest.

05:35.000 --> 05:41.000
Well, while I'm still single, I should probably travel, because the same thing is probably going to happen to me.

05:41.000 --> 05:46.000
You should have read the fine print about her being afraid of the dark end of being alone.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
But you love her, right?

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
Sure.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
Alright.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
She's been giving me crap today about my new computer.

05:53.000 --> 05:57.000
Aw, sorry to hear it. You should never come between a man and his computer.

05:57.000 --> 06:03.000
Well, see, now at my house it's the other way around, because I'm on my computer all the time, and Dan's playing video games.

06:03.000 --> 06:11.000
See, that'd be awesome though, but you know, my wife doesn't play video games, and when she does, I can't leave the room, because I don't know why.

06:11.000 --> 06:15.000
You need to petition PopCap to make a Bejeweled 3 fast to keep her busy.

06:15.000 --> 06:21.000
That's only for a matter of minutes, and then she'll get bored with it.

06:21.000 --> 06:25.000
We never did realize just how prophetic that t-shirt would be.

06:25.000 --> 06:29.000
It's true, huh? Game over.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
Alright, let's get to some more emails.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
Okay.

06:32.000 --> 06:37.000
Hey, O.L.R., I just wanted to get in my crappy story about the lack of Wii's in the world.

06:37.000 --> 06:50.000
I live in Sarnia, Ontario, Canada, and at a specific department store whose name I will not mention, there is what you call a midnight madness sale where people will stay up to midnight trying to get the 15 minute only sales.

06:50.000 --> 06:55.000
Well, in this particular store, the big grand prize draw was a chance to buy a Wii.

06:55.000 --> 07:00.000
Not that one gets free or 50% off, but just to have a chance to purchase one.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
I also heard about a guy in Australia purchasing one for $590.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
Nintendo make more Wii's.

07:05.000 --> 07:10.000
Keep the good work, O.L.R. PKJR 92.

07:10.000 --> 07:14.000
The only way to make your PC go faster is to throw it out a window.

07:14.000 --> 07:24.000
And I think what also probably unfortunately sucks for this person who is emailing us, thank you for the email by the way, is the fact that they do live in a pretty remote area of Canada.

07:24.000 --> 07:42.000
And A, you're in Canada, which is kind of, even though a very important, very large country, is still outside of that trinity of Japan, United States, and the big Europe regions like Germany, France, and Britain basically.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
Basically the big ones in Spain.

07:45.000 --> 07:49.000
I'm not trying to leave anybody out, but I'm saying the ones where gaming is more prevalent there in Europe.

07:49.000 --> 07:55.000
Canada kind of comes after that sometimes with some things like Rock Band we've seen.

07:55.000 --> 07:59.000
So unfortunately sometimes they get the short end of the stick with the Wii shipments as well.

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
And Nintendo can only make so many of those.

08:02.000 --> 08:12.000
My advice would be though, I don't remember if he said he was trying to get one or whatever, but online, because you know, you go to a place like Amazon, they're not going to care if you're in Canada or what have you.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
A lot of that's the same for U.S. and Canada.

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
Unless you're buying toys from Amazon U.K.

08:17.000 --> 08:22.000
But that is weird though about the whole raffle to get the opportunity to buy a Wii.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
That is weird.

08:23.000 --> 08:28.000
You know I have to order my U.K. toys from Amazon Canada.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
Interesting.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
Yes.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
Just thought I'd share that with you.

08:32.000 --> 08:43.000
ActDeft wanted to respond to something he heard in Dr. Noir's email, and that is that there are a lot of Wiis unsold in Mexico, but that's because it costs almost double than it costs in the U.S. because of import fees.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
Everyone import them from Mexico.

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
There you go. If you want to pay more for it, you can get a Wii from Mexico.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
That's how you could get it in remote Canada.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
Ah, the bliss of disposable income, huh?

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
I guess.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
So, moving on with email.

08:55.000 --> 09:02.000
You guys talked about giving Zelda a hand job, but since she's the princess, call it what it is and Zelda gets fingered.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
This is from Mark F.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
I stand corrected. Thank you.

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
Sky talked about simple baseball games just to chime in.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
Bases Loaded was way better than Baseball Stars.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
Lies.

09:13.000 --> 09:17.000
And the best slash easiest baseball game was simply Baseball for the NES.

09:17.000 --> 09:21.000
Fun times.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
Moving forward for Robert M.

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
People with your initial names.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
Hello and hope you had a nice break.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
Hopefully you've ironed out most of the bugs in your new studio.

09:31.000 --> 09:35.000
I keep getting the podcast feed about a day late.

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
Really like the weird Al for the stupid awards.

09:38.000 --> 09:45.000
And just a quick thought on the last show, you mentioned Facebook as a verb instead of using it in the sense of friending.

09:45.000 --> 09:50.000
My friend went into, went more the head desk direction.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
That is face booking.

09:51.000 --> 09:55.000
Someone would literally entail hitting them in the face with a book.

09:55.000 --> 10:01.000
Refreshing a witty comment relating online community sites and physical pain goes here.

10:01.000 --> 10:05.000
You mean like every time I go to MySpace, I feel like I'm going to have an aneurysm.

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
Yep.

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
Actually your face meets a book.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
That's face booking.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
I like that.

10:13.000 --> 10:23.000
I was wondering what your opinion would be on the massively multiplayer online sports game such as an NFL game where all 22 players could be controlled by online gamers.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
Hard to coordinate?

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
Probably.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
I'd like to see something like that.

10:26.000 --> 10:30.000
I'd like to see how something like that would work.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
Brilliant idea honestly.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
I don't know why it's not out there.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
People don't know how to work together.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
Maybe, yeah.

10:36.000 --> 10:45.000
It's partially that and partially probably that, you know, some people, you know, in a football team, you have your standout stars and then you have the other guys.

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
And who wants to be the other guys?

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
When you play a video game, you're trying to be something you're not.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
I've been on the bench.

10:52.000 --> 11:02.000
Well, that's why it would be like what was that game that my husband was playing, NFL Pro or something, where your team is all fantasy, you know.

11:02.000 --> 11:07.000
It's some of the greatest players that you've had in sports history.

11:07.000 --> 11:13.000
Or maybe just that, you know, maybe you pick from a pool of players.

11:13.000 --> 11:18.000
Like your team is actually a really big team that you form with friends and then like so many of you play in matches.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
I don't know.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
That would be really hard to coordinate though.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
People don't know how to work together.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
I like the idea.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
I like the concept.

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
The execution would be a little tricky of that, but I like your concept.

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
I don't think it can work with like a party of more than seven.

11:29.000 --> 11:33.000
That's why, you know, it works in RPGs but not in sports.

11:33.000 --> 11:39.000
I think they should do it in hockey so that like even if you aren't really controlling the puck, at least you can go beat somebody up.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
You know a game I would like to see.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
What?

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
Cube.

11:43.000 --> 11:49.000
How about Blades of Steel 2, which by the way, original Blades of Steel came out on Virtual Console in the US last week.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
Bless you.

11:51.000 --> 11:59.000
Our Sakura's having a sneeze fit, so I will praise Blades of Steel a little more on the great, great hockey game it was on the NES.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
Good times.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
By the way, I used the Wii gifting feature this week.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
Oh, you did?

12:02.000 --> 12:06.000
Yes, I used the Wii gifting feature to send my friend in New York a copy of Kid Icarus.

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
And I tried to send her Mario 3, but the Wii rejected it.

12:09.000 --> 12:13.000
So the Wii is smart enough to not let you send games your friends already have.

12:13.000 --> 12:21.000
Did you see, and I forgot to mention this on our show roll, that Microsoft did the gifting feature now in the US with points.

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
You can give other accounts points now.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
Where did they do that?

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
I don't know, but I read it somewhere.

12:27.000 --> 12:31.000
I read it on one of the, like, JoySick or Kotaku.

12:31.000 --> 12:34.000
Is that why Xbox has been broken the past few days?

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
I don't know.

12:35.000 --> 12:47.000
But that's great for me because, you know, having multiple consoles and say if I want to, you know, install, like, a map or something and buy it for each one, I don't have to buy points cards for every single console.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
Interesting.

12:49.000 --> 12:54.000
By the way, our entire chat room could hear your power sneezes and say, bless you.

12:54.000 --> 12:58.000
Well, you know what, my nose feels like a nightmare of pain and suffering.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
Sorry to hear it.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
So thank you, chat room.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
I'm glad you heard me blow my nose, too.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
All right.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
Well, any more emails?

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
I sound like a foghorn.

13:06.000 --> 13:11.000
So there are emails.

13:11.000 --> 13:17.000
Hey, OLR crew, I found myself unable to sleep one night at 3 in the morning and popped on your radio feed on iTunes.

13:17.000 --> 13:20.000
And I was able to fall asleep.

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
And I noticed it was playing much more melon music than normal.

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
Is the rotation geared more towards slow calming songs at night?

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
Or did I just happen upon a random anomaly?

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
Either way, it helps me get to sleep, so thank you, guys.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
Keep up the awesome show, AZHP.

13:33.000 --> 13:38.000
Welcome, and you can thank the total randomness, because our playlist is the same all day long.

13:38.000 --> 13:41.000
We don't do anything special at night, although maybe we should.

13:41.000 --> 13:47.000
I am going to be changing the playlist up because I have a break from work here for another week.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
So I'm going to be working on a lot of OLR stuff.

13:49.000 --> 13:58.000
And one thing I'm going to be doing is cleaning out the 24-7 show and putting in some more classic game tunes and, yeah, just cycling some stuff in and out.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
So check it out.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
All right.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
Two emails left.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
Thank God.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
All right.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
We got a bunch.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
This is a sample.

14:06.000 --> 14:11.000
So I updated my PSP the other day and was very pleased with the internet radio edition.

14:11.000 --> 14:17.000
Given the fact that I listened to your show on my PSP, it would be even better if I could listen to it live on there as well.

14:17.000 --> 14:21.000
It would be a nice Christmas present, please?

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
We don't know how to make that happen just yet, but we have to get on that.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
Loki, you got to figure that out.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
Don't look at me.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
I don't know how to do it.

14:28.000 --> 14:32.000
You have to basically run a relay through Shoutcast.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
Oh, it has to be Shoutcast, huh?

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
Yeah.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
We'll see.

14:36.000 --> 14:43.000
I want to say somebody sent me an email about some Shoutcast stuff, so I will look into that as the week goes on.

14:43.000 --> 14:51.000
I would assume, well, maybe you could probably broadcast on Shoutcast and Live 365 at the same time.

14:51.000 --> 14:56.000
Or we could just leave Live 365 and do Shoutcast with as many people as we want on the feed, but we'll see.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
We'll see.

14:57.000 --> 15:03.000
Anything is a possibility, but I can say I do know you can listen to all games on your PSP.

15:03.000 --> 15:10.000
They did figure out how to set it up, so if nothing else, you can always listen to our syndicated runs that air on allgames.com on Monday nights and Tuesday mornings.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
Well, there's more to that email.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
Okay.

15:13.000 --> 15:18.000
Also, I'd like to note that when I listen to you guys, you always find a way to make me laugh no matter what kind of mood I'm in.

15:18.000 --> 15:22.000
So thank you, and I wish you all a very Merry Christmas and many more Happy New Years to come.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
Happy Holidays.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
Smile face, Oscar.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
Thank you.

15:26.000 --> 15:30.000
I want to say Tiger Claw says, I can listen to OLR on my PSP using PSP radio.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
So I guess it is possible.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
Last email.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
Ow.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
Maybe share that with everybody.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
Tiger Claw, send Loki an email.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
Would you like to share with the rest of the class?

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
Send Loki an email.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
Don't send me an email.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
Just post it in the chat.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.000
I don't want to get into it right now.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
Fine.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
Then post it in the chat.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
Email.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
All right.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
Email.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
Hey Sky, Loki, and Dark Sakura.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
Hi.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
I'm going to start this out with a true fact.

15:53.000 --> 15:58.000
OLR is the best, funniest, and most informative, engaging show in the world.

15:58.000 --> 16:02.000
You guys and girl have done a great job, and for that you should be commended.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
Good.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
Somebody commend us, please.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
One question, though.

16:07.000 --> 16:12.000
I just got a PlayStation 3 for Christmas, and the only game I have for it right now is Motorstorm.

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
What would be the top three games you would recommend for me to get?

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
Marvel Ultimate Alliance.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
Sell your PS3.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
No.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
It was a gift.

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
All right.

16:23.000 --> 16:26.000
Marvel Ultimate Alliance.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
Resistance, Fall of Man.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
Oblivion.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
Oblivion.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
Absolutely Oblivion.

16:31.000 --> 16:34.000
Those are actually the three I'd name right there.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
Oblivion.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
Resistance.

16:38.000 --> 16:43.000
Marvel, if you're into that.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
I mean, obviously Jamie's into that.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
It's a fun game.

16:45.000 --> 16:48.000
I'm trying to think if there's something else that maybe was something.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
It has a lot of options.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
Heavenly Sword.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
Yeah.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
It's probably fun.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
If you have two hours.

16:53.000 --> 16:56.000
It's just J100 Matt's recommending Warhawk.

16:56.000 --> 16:59.000
There you go.

16:59.000 --> 17:06.000
Resistance, I would say probably Uncharted, Drake's Fortune, and depending on how you

17:06.000 --> 17:10.000
feel about Ratchet and Clank, Ratchet and Clank.

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
Otherwise, I don't know.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
Motorstorm's pretty good.

17:15.000 --> 17:18.000
But if you bought your PS3, you probably already have Motorstorm.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
That's what he said.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
All he has now is Motorstorm.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
Well, then.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
Oblivion.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
Nah.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
I wouldn't do Oblivion.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
Fine.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
It's old.

17:27.000 --> 17:30.000
I mean, they're going to come out with something new here and buy it, and then all of a sudden,

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
oh crap.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
Well, actually, I guess it is cheap.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
If you don't buy the expansion, it's like a $30 game.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
So, sure.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
Oblivion.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
And buy a bunch of Blu-Ray movies.

17:38.000 --> 17:42.000
A lot of the PS3 games are really cheap now, and you'll find a lot of them used.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
Seth is saying Unreal Tournament in our chat room.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
That's probably not a bad pick.

17:45.000 --> 17:49.500
Now, see, Unreal Tournament and Warhawk, depending on how you feel about online-only multiplayer

17:49.500 --> 17:50.500
games.

17:50.500 --> 17:54.880
That's, you know, in Unreal Tournament 3, if you don't like Unreal, you know, really,

17:54.880 --> 18:00.000
really fast, you know, kind of trigger-happy games, then you might not like that.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.120
All right.

18:02.120 --> 18:03.120
Is that it for emails?

18:03.120 --> 18:04.120
No?

18:04.120 --> 18:05.120
Oh, my God.

18:05.120 --> 18:06.120
No, there was more to that one.

18:06.120 --> 18:07.120
All right.

18:07.120 --> 18:08.120
Because people keep interrupting me.

18:08.120 --> 18:09.120
Oh, sorry.

18:09.120 --> 18:10.120
Sir.

18:10.120 --> 18:15.160
Also, I think Loki shouldn't get the bad rap he does from blasting Sony, because Sony really

18:15.160 --> 18:20.000
does leave us gamers out to dry in terms of innovation, besides the PS3, and new hardware

18:20.000 --> 18:22.320
such as new peripherals for the PSP.

18:22.320 --> 18:24.440
So until they get wise, keep going strong.

18:24.440 --> 18:25.880
Canada salutes you.

18:25.880 --> 18:27.400
Sincerely, Josh G.

18:27.400 --> 18:30.440
Well, thank you, Canada.

18:30.440 --> 18:31.440
I salute Canada.

18:31.440 --> 18:32.760
I love Canada.

18:32.760 --> 18:33.760
And I like this.

18:33.760 --> 18:36.000
What's the difference between Windows 95 and Windows 98?

18:36.000 --> 18:38.100
Answer, three years.

18:38.100 --> 18:39.240
That joke is like 10 years old.

18:39.240 --> 18:43.640
I know, but I think it's great that somebody put that in their email.

18:43.640 --> 18:44.640
All right.

18:44.640 --> 18:46.640
So now we're done with emails, yes?

18:46.640 --> 18:47.640
We are done.

18:47.640 --> 18:49.600
And I'm saving and leaving out that one for you.

18:49.600 --> 18:50.600
All right.

18:50.600 --> 18:51.600
Thank you very much.

18:51.600 --> 18:52.600
All right.

18:52.600 --> 18:55.360
Let's get back into some news, and then we're going to get back into the Skype line and

18:55.360 --> 18:58.520
go over July and the rest of the year.

18:58.520 --> 19:00.640
Release dates, or lack thereof.

19:00.640 --> 19:03.200
I thought I would at least open it up if anybody has any release dates.

19:03.200 --> 19:04.200
How about the US, Loki?

19:04.200 --> 19:05.200
There is not much.

19:05.200 --> 19:09.800
And from what I gather, these four games are apparently a GameStop exclusive.

19:09.800 --> 19:14.600
Good for them, I guess, scoring these awesome games, all of which are from a wonderful company,

19:14.600 --> 19:20.920
a company named Conspiracy Entertainment, who is known for their extremely high quality

19:20.920 --> 19:21.920
games.

19:21.920 --> 19:26.880
Okay, no, not really, but you can get four racing games this week.

19:26.880 --> 19:38.240
Rig Racer 2, which has you racing big rigs, Kawasaki Quad Bikes, Monster Trucks Off-Road,

19:38.240 --> 19:43.920
and then Classic British Motor Racing.

19:43.920 --> 19:44.920
Let me just save you time.

19:44.920 --> 19:46.760
What exactly is Classic British Motor Racing?

19:46.760 --> 19:48.000
Like an Aston Martin or...

19:48.000 --> 19:51.640
No, it's like racing minis.

19:51.640 --> 19:53.080
None of these games are that great.

19:53.080 --> 19:57.600
Although, they do have a game coming out, though, that's going to be a jet ski racing

19:57.600 --> 20:01.480
game, and it looks just like Waverly 64.

20:01.480 --> 20:07.940
So that has potential, but I would, if you can rent these, go for it.

20:07.940 --> 20:08.940
They're cheap.

20:08.940 --> 20:12.680
I think they're like $19.99, so if you have money that you want to throw away, I can tell

20:12.680 --> 20:19.760
you one thing, don't buy Monster Trucks Off-Road, because Monster Trucks, they had Off-Road

20:19.760 --> 20:24.540
Arena or something like that, that really sucked, and then there is Off-Road Extreme

20:24.540 --> 20:29.600
Special Edition, which got like a one on IGN.

20:29.600 --> 20:31.540
It's like a piece of shit.

20:31.540 --> 20:36.840
Most of these are crap, but just kind of know it going into it.

20:36.840 --> 20:38.080
That's all you can find this week.

20:38.080 --> 20:40.120
Next week, I promise you better games.

20:40.120 --> 20:41.520
How about the UK, Jamie?

20:41.520 --> 20:45.760
I'll give some highlights for what's coming out next week, just the things that interest

20:45.760 --> 20:46.760
me specifically.

20:46.760 --> 20:48.960
Why not?

20:48.960 --> 21:00.440
There is Dancing Stage Universe, Myst on DS, SingStar on PS3, Sonic Rivals 2, I like, there's

21:00.440 --> 21:10.880
one called Teleaddicts, which I think is great, and another Yu-Gi-Oh game, but I'll go over

21:10.880 --> 21:12.760
the big massive list later.

21:12.760 --> 21:15.960
How about the Virtual Console?

21:15.960 --> 21:22.160
There is stuff for Virtual Console, this is the stuff actually that has been out now.

21:22.160 --> 21:30.400
Three games that are to be out is Blades of Steel, which we've gone over, Skate or Die,

21:30.400 --> 21:31.400
and Monster Lair.

21:31.400 --> 21:32.400
So there you go.

21:32.400 --> 21:34.600
We haven't gotten Skate or Die in the US, huh?

21:34.600 --> 21:35.600
No.

21:35.600 --> 21:36.600
I'll bet you that'll be Monday's game.

21:36.600 --> 21:38.880
I'll bet you Monday will be Skate or Die.

21:38.880 --> 21:42.440
Usually when it comes out in Europe we get it the next week, I noticed, and we did get

21:42.440 --> 21:43.640
Blades of Steel here last week.

21:43.640 --> 21:46.360
It's so weird the way they've been releasing those games, like you would think there'd

21:46.360 --> 21:52.200
be some pattern to it, but it really just seems like it's just kind of a crap shoot.

21:52.200 --> 21:56.160
This is the part where I would go over Japanese releases, but there is nothing, not a damn

21:56.160 --> 22:00.460
thing I feel like mentioning, so that's it, no Japanese releases.

22:00.460 --> 22:05.380
So that being said, we are going to open up the Skype line, 1877 Game OLR, username on

22:05.380 --> 22:09.440
Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, and we're going to go over with you guys, our listeners, the

22:09.440 --> 22:14.960
last few months of the year, and we also want to get your picks for the best game of 2007

22:14.960 --> 22:18.220
and the worst game of 2007.

22:18.220 --> 22:22.120
So go ahead and give us a call, and remember, if you've never used Skype before, you might

22:22.120 --> 22:28.240
want to give Echo123 a call to make sure you sound okay.

22:28.240 --> 22:33.720
Unless you're calling over the phone, then there's really nothing you can do to test.

22:33.720 --> 22:36.800
Because there is a little bit of a delay between the live and when the people hear it, they

22:36.800 --> 22:40.160
probably don't know it's open yet, so we're just trying to fill in a little bit of time

22:40.160 --> 22:41.680
here.

22:41.680 --> 22:46.060
Later on in the program, we're going to be going over our top five lists of the five

22:46.060 --> 22:50.960
most fun games we played this year, and then we'll tally it up what overall was the best

22:50.960 --> 22:56.680
and the worst game of 2007, and we'll give some predictions for 2008.

22:56.680 --> 23:01.080
And we haven't forgotten the FUs either.

23:01.080 --> 23:07.200
And of course, a lot of our regular callers are gone this week on vacation, away from

23:07.200 --> 23:10.520
the holidays, so I think that's where, you know, if you're wondering, like, why isn't

23:10.520 --> 23:11.520
our phone ringing off the hook?

23:11.520 --> 23:12.520
I think that's why.

23:12.520 --> 23:13.520
Who leaves for, like, New Year's?

23:13.520 --> 23:14.520
I understand Christmas, but, I mean, I don't know.

23:14.520 --> 23:18.400
I think people are still gone from Christmas, is what happens.

23:18.400 --> 23:24.160
Oh, well.

23:24.160 --> 23:27.200
So what's going to happen if nobody calls?

23:27.200 --> 23:28.200
I'll do July.

23:28.200 --> 23:29.200
Yeah, we'll just have to do it again.

23:29.200 --> 23:30.200
Someone call us!

23:30.200 --> 23:31.200
We can do it.

23:31.200 --> 23:32.200
We don't always play with the chat room.

23:32.200 --> 23:33.200
People are just being shy.

23:33.200 --> 23:34.200
We have plenty of people in chat.

23:34.200 --> 23:38.600
There's over, almost 50 people in chat, so I don't know what the heck's going on there.

23:38.600 --> 23:40.000
Pick up your damn phone.

23:40.000 --> 23:41.200
Don't you people have phones?

23:41.200 --> 23:42.200
And call us.

23:42.200 --> 23:44.400
Some folks are waiting for certain months.

23:44.400 --> 23:47.080
No, you don't wait.

23:47.080 --> 23:48.080
You do some R-terms.

23:48.080 --> 23:53.520
Pick up the goddamn phone and your goddamn phone call.

23:53.520 --> 23:54.520
We're getting a call.

23:54.520 --> 23:56.760
I hear on Orange Line's radio, who's this?

23:56.760 --> 24:00.280
Oh, this is the escapist.

24:00.280 --> 24:02.120
Escapist is here.

24:02.120 --> 24:04.120
I'm sorry, who's this?

24:04.120 --> 24:05.120
Escapist.

24:05.120 --> 24:07.480
Well, Escapist, how are you, sir?

24:07.480 --> 24:08.480
How you doing?

24:08.480 --> 24:11.960
I'm doing wonderful, yourself?

24:11.960 --> 24:12.960
Very good.

24:12.960 --> 24:16.080
There's a little bit of a delay, but I notice you're calling us from Canada, so that's probably

24:16.080 --> 24:17.080
why there's a bit of a delay.

24:17.080 --> 24:18.080
Okay.

24:18.080 --> 24:23.220
All right, so I'm going to go through this rather quickly here, and we want to hear your

24:23.220 --> 24:26.680
thoughts on some of the highlights of 2007.

24:26.680 --> 24:29.240
So let's talk first a little bit about July.

24:29.240 --> 24:37.120
July, episode 237 was when a brain game in the UK was pulled over the use of the word

24:37.120 --> 24:42.380
spastic, and I apologize if I offended anyone by saying that word just then, but we kind

24:42.380 --> 24:46.860
of hear in the US go, well, that's not a big deal, but in the UK, because it slipped through

24:46.860 --> 24:52.000
the cracks because of those cultural differences, the word spastic got a brain game pulled over

24:52.000 --> 24:53.480
in the UK.

24:53.480 --> 24:59.040
Episode number 238 was when the PlayStation 3 got a price cut, so the PlayStation 3 was

24:59.040 --> 25:03.080
announced that it was going to be getting a price cut, and a lot of folks said it needed

25:03.080 --> 25:06.040
that about six months earlier.

25:06.040 --> 25:10.440
Episode 239 was the week that mini E3 happened.

25:10.440 --> 25:14.680
That was when Mario Kart Wii was announced for the Wii, and Cena was announced for the

25:14.680 --> 25:19.540
360, and the PSP was announced that had a redesign, and just in general kind of the

25:19.540 --> 25:22.360
changed E3.

25:22.360 --> 25:26.520
Do you think low-key the E3 is going to be very similar to how it was this year or next

25:26.520 --> 25:30.740
year, or do you think they're going to get kind of, especially since they're moving back

25:30.740 --> 25:33.240
to the LA Convention Center, do you think they're going to get a little bit of maybe

25:33.240 --> 25:34.240
what they missed?

25:34.240 --> 25:36.280
I think it's going to be about the same.

25:36.280 --> 25:41.080
Speaking of which, you need to talk to whoever was supposed to invite us last year, and get

25:41.080 --> 25:46.680
them to invite, or this year I should say, and be ready for this next year, because I

25:46.680 --> 25:47.680
want to go.

25:47.680 --> 25:49.680
I do too, we'll see.

25:49.680 --> 25:58.520
Yeah, all I remember from mini E3 is how disappointed I was with the Mario Kart and Zapper announcements.

25:58.520 --> 26:02.680
Not necessarily Mario Kart, because Mario Kart's really fucking awesome, but the fact

26:02.680 --> 26:06.600
that it comes with a plastic steering wheel, all these peripherals, they were like, God,

26:06.600 --> 26:11.360
this is a stupid idea, who keeps releasing this crap, and Nintendo's like, hey, we're

26:11.360 --> 26:16.160
going to do it too, that makes it a good idea, right, and then the Zapper we saw was like

26:16.160 --> 26:21.640
a pretty cool attachment, kind of like the nunchuck, and then all of a sudden that's

26:21.640 --> 26:27.120
this piece of plastic crap, I don't know, it wasn't all that exciting.

26:27.120 --> 26:29.440
Escapist, did you follow mini E3 news?

26:29.440 --> 26:34.960
What did you think of this year's E3, new and improved?

26:34.960 --> 26:39.200
I kind of really ignored it this year, I don't know, I've never been a big fan of E3 to begin

26:39.200 --> 26:40.200
with.

26:40.200 --> 26:44.240
It was like a whole bunch of excitement for a couple months, and whatever.

26:44.240 --> 26:46.520
What makes you not a fan of E3?

26:46.520 --> 26:54.560
Just too much information at one time, I get kind of overloaded and overexcited a bit.

26:54.560 --> 27:00.360
I can kind of see that, it does seem like the year is entirely dead, and then E3 happens,

27:00.360 --> 27:08.000
and then it's dead again, you know what I mean?

27:08.000 --> 27:12.800
Episode 240 was in July, it was the last episode we taped in July, and that was the week that

27:12.800 --> 27:18.520
South Park, the World of Warcraft episode got nominated for an Emmy, which kind of made

27:18.520 --> 27:20.120
a lot of us go, wow.

27:20.120 --> 27:21.120
And it did win.

27:21.120 --> 27:26.360
And it did end up winning the Emmy, actually, but of course the South Park wow episode integrated

27:26.360 --> 27:30.920
the World of Warcraft very well with the South Park kids, but of course the one thing I remember

27:30.920 --> 27:34.640
was bathroom, bathroom!

27:34.640 --> 27:41.920
Alright, Escapist, out of those stories, the brain game, the price cut, mini E3 and South

27:41.920 --> 27:49.280
Park World of Warcraft, what do you think had the biggest impact for 2007's gaming?

27:49.280 --> 27:54.160
Well even though I just undermined it earlier, I'd definitely say the E3 there, just because

27:54.160 --> 27:57.760
the whole new year for E3, a new direction they wanted to go, it's still the same kind

27:57.760 --> 28:02.240
of information that got released from what I saw, but a lot less people go into it.

28:02.240 --> 28:05.360
I think you're right, I think even though it is different, I think it definitely was

28:05.360 --> 28:07.560
the highlight of the month and the year in some ways.

28:07.560 --> 28:14.140
I think the way that they did E3, I mean besides the multiple hotels and it being kind of difficult

28:14.140 --> 28:18.860
to travel from one place to another, I like the format where it's just like those gamers

28:18.860 --> 28:23.720
days where you sit down, you get a presentation, here's all the games that we have, here's

28:23.720 --> 28:28.520
all the information we're going to give you, then you move along to the next group or the

28:28.520 --> 28:34.200
next company and you kind of digest all that stuff as well, you get your press kits, and

28:34.200 --> 28:39.320
then you go play the games at the end, just like a gamers day, and that I think works

28:39.320 --> 28:43.600
a lot better for me than having to just navigate all around because I end up missing stuff.

28:43.600 --> 28:52.000
I agree, and I said this before on the show, the two years ago, the last big E3, I knew

28:52.000 --> 28:55.800
something was wrong when Paris Hilton was there and drawing these big crowds because

28:55.800 --> 28:58.720
she had some fucking crappy cell phone game coming out, right?

28:58.720 --> 29:00.020
She got the name wrong on.

29:00.020 --> 29:03.440
You knew that something was broken with E3 at that point?

29:03.440 --> 29:04.440
Yeah.

29:04.440 --> 29:05.440
Interesting.

29:05.440 --> 29:09.520
All right, well let's move on to August, scapists, we're going to go over the four

29:09.520 --> 29:13.200
stories and then you tell us which one you think had the most impact.

29:13.200 --> 29:17.680
Episode 241 kicked off August and it was another WoW story because that was the week that Blizzcon

29:17.680 --> 29:23.000
happened and Wrath of the Lich King was announced and of course obviously we even had some folks,

29:23.000 --> 29:27.680
I remember Extifer, one of our regular guests, actually went to Blizzcon and came back with

29:27.680 --> 29:31.960
a full report and of course a lot of WoW players were very excited about the Wrath of the Lich

29:31.960 --> 29:33.760
King expansion.

29:33.760 --> 29:39.480
Episode 242 was the week that the news was breaking that the Xbox 360 core system was

29:39.480 --> 29:41.200
being phased out of stores.

29:41.200 --> 29:42.520
And the price dropped, too.

29:42.520 --> 29:46.920
Yeah, when Best Buy started to phase them out of their computers and Target was phasing

29:46.920 --> 29:50.760
them out of their computers, the systems were slowly disappearing which kind of made people

29:50.760 --> 29:52.680
go, hmm, what's going on there?

29:52.680 --> 29:58.600
And then of course subsequently we learned about the Elite and all that stuff and the

29:58.600 --> 30:04.280
Elite have been out, the arcade and the other stuff.

30:04.280 --> 30:08.320
Episode 243, Toys R Us breaks the Bioshock street date.

30:08.320 --> 30:12.560
Bioshock came out towards the end of August and Toys R Us broke the street date and people

30:12.560 --> 30:16.320
were taking pictures of receipts and that stuff was all over the internet.

30:16.320 --> 30:20.560
And then episode 244 in August was the week we talked about a brand new game Konami was

30:20.560 --> 30:25.560
putting out called New International Track and Field and what made this story stand out,

30:25.560 --> 30:30.160
the fact that there was going to be a cartoon version of Serial Killer Pyramid Head in the

30:30.160 --> 30:32.520
game, a little chibi pyramid head game.

30:32.520 --> 30:36.400
Now, the game is not out yet, but we were just talking about the announcement, although

30:36.400 --> 30:40.240
I should say that if you saw the Christmas cards that some of the big game companies

30:40.240 --> 30:44.120
put out, Konami actually had a little picture of chibi pyramid head in theirs and he was

30:44.120 --> 30:46.640
opening up a box with new gloves in it.

30:46.640 --> 30:47.760
It was so cute.

30:47.760 --> 30:48.880
You just reminded me of something.

30:48.880 --> 30:50.360
What's that?

30:50.360 --> 30:54.480
My husband's boss gave him one of the Portal Christmas cards.

30:54.480 --> 30:56.880
From Aperture Science?

30:56.880 --> 30:58.040
I stole it.

30:58.040 --> 30:59.320
Very good.

30:59.320 --> 31:01.040
You got a card, but I stole it.

31:01.040 --> 31:07.920
Anyhow, Escapist, out of those stories, Blizzcon, Xbox 360 core phased out, Toys R Us breaking

31:07.920 --> 31:11.280
a street date, and New International Track and Field, or anything you can think of, what

31:11.280 --> 31:12.280
do you think had the most impact?

31:12.280 --> 31:15.400
I know that's a little bit of a tougher month because it was after E3, but what do you think

31:15.400 --> 31:17.400
had the most impact?

31:17.400 --> 31:19.400
Jeepers.

31:19.400 --> 31:27.120
For me, I definitely have to say the Toys R Us thing was kind of a big deal there.

31:27.120 --> 31:30.640
It's another insight into the distribution chain there that people are really excited

31:30.640 --> 31:34.080
to get their games now and stuff like that.

31:34.080 --> 31:36.320
Toys R Us isn't really paying attention.

31:36.320 --> 31:37.320
I don't know.

31:37.320 --> 31:40.600
I'm excited to be on air, that's all.

31:40.600 --> 31:41.600
No, it's all good.

31:41.600 --> 31:45.720
It's a very good point that you're saying there is that a big chain like Toys R Us you

31:45.720 --> 31:49.760
would think would know better, but sometimes down on the lower levels, folks kind of make

31:49.760 --> 31:54.160
their mistakes and all that stuff, and these things kind of slip through the cracks.

31:54.160 --> 31:57.920
But it is very interesting when these types of things have happened, because there's been

31:57.920 --> 31:59.920
a lot of similar stories throughout the year.

31:59.920 --> 32:07.420
Kmart broke the Mass Effect street date, Target broke the word about the Xbox 360 arcade units

32:07.420 --> 32:09.360
before even Microsoft had put them out, right?

32:09.360 --> 32:10.360
Like, weren't they selling them?

32:10.360 --> 32:12.800
Circuit City broke the PlayStation 3 prices throughout the day.

32:12.800 --> 32:14.480
This kind of shit was happening all year long.

32:14.480 --> 32:21.240
It's amazing to watch the internet's reaction to it all, but like the scans, the YouTubes,

32:21.240 --> 32:25.720
the pictures of receipts in the game going, I have the biggest E-peen in the planet because

32:25.720 --> 32:27.480
I have this game and you don't.

32:27.480 --> 32:31.340
Like all that type of stuff is just fascinating to watch, and it was definitely a trend throughout

32:31.340 --> 32:32.340
2007.

32:32.340 --> 32:35.080
How many people were actually playing Halo 3 before that came out?

32:35.080 --> 32:36.080
I did.

32:36.080 --> 32:37.080
Excellent point.

32:37.080 --> 32:38.460
I had already beaten it before it came out.

32:38.460 --> 32:42.920
There you go, and that was another huge one, Halo 3, absolutely, and that was in August

32:42.920 --> 32:43.920
as well, right?

32:43.920 --> 32:44.920
October.

32:44.920 --> 32:45.920
September.

32:45.920 --> 32:46.920
Almost.

32:46.920 --> 32:47.920
End of September.

32:47.920 --> 32:48.920
When we get into the next month.

32:48.920 --> 32:49.920
All right.

32:49.920 --> 32:52.840
Well, Escapist, before we let you go, we have a few more things to ask you, and that would

32:52.840 --> 32:58.440
be what, in your opinion, was the worst freaking game of 2007 that should be avoided at all

32:58.440 --> 32:59.440
costs?

32:59.440 --> 33:04.880
Well, normally I would go with the obvious pick like yours, except I actually didn't

33:04.880 --> 33:07.600
play it, so that would kind of be a bit of a cop-out on my part.

33:07.600 --> 33:10.680
Well, that's fair enough, but then we have to change it up.

33:10.680 --> 33:12.680
What do you think, then?

33:12.680 --> 33:17.720
I'm going to have to be annoying and say I didn't really like Call of Duty all that much.

33:17.720 --> 33:20.240
Call of Duty 4 never really did anything for me.

33:20.240 --> 33:22.040
Maybe you might see I'm not a true shooter fan or whatnot.

33:22.040 --> 33:25.960
Maybe it's because I had a horrible time online playing it, but I don't know.

33:25.960 --> 33:29.560
That's one of the games in my collection I'm probably going to get rid of first.

33:29.560 --> 33:30.560
Oh, snap.

33:30.560 --> 33:32.680
Call of Duty 4, worst game of the year.

33:32.680 --> 33:33.680
Hey, you know what?

33:33.680 --> 33:34.680
It happens.

33:34.680 --> 33:39.480
I seem to remember last year, we had some of the guests from other podcasts, and I want

33:39.480 --> 33:43.840
to say someone said that some really big game was their least favorite game of the year,

33:43.840 --> 33:47.320
and it was definitely controversial, but it was really funny when it happened.

33:47.320 --> 33:51.440
But Hannah Montana was the best, I think.

33:51.440 --> 33:52.440
Gears of War.

33:52.440 --> 33:53.440
No, that was different.

33:53.440 --> 33:54.440
Yes, it was Gears of War.

33:54.440 --> 33:55.440
I think somebody said Gears of War was the worst game that came out.

33:55.440 --> 33:58.840
I think it was Michelle from Video Game Outsiders.

33:58.840 --> 33:59.840
I think.

33:59.840 --> 34:00.840
I don't remember.

34:00.840 --> 34:01.840
I'd have to go back and listen, but anyway.

34:01.840 --> 34:02.840
All right.

34:02.840 --> 34:03.840
Never mind.

34:03.840 --> 34:04.840
That was last year.

34:04.840 --> 34:05.840
That was so 2006.

34:05.840 --> 34:06.840
Let's talk about 2007.

34:06.840 --> 34:10.400
Best game of 2007, Escapist, in your opinion?

34:10.400 --> 34:16.880
Last time, I tried to avoid the obvious pick, but I have to go the obvious with this one.

34:16.880 --> 34:17.880
It would have to be the Orange Box.

34:17.880 --> 34:21.640
It's probably the best gaming value I've ever seen in my freaking life.

34:21.640 --> 34:22.640
The Orange Box.

34:22.640 --> 34:25.960
Five classic games all crammed in one bundle, and you can't ignore the Portal.

34:25.960 --> 34:27.800
I can't say I disagree with you, sir.

34:27.800 --> 34:31.940
The Orange Box is a great deal, and that right there makes it definitely a worthy candidate

34:31.940 --> 34:32.940
for game of the year.

34:32.940 --> 34:36.800
And then you have Portal in there as well, which of course is a brilliant game in itself.

34:36.800 --> 34:40.480
Escapist, thanks so much for being on the show tonight, even though we had a little

34:40.480 --> 34:47.080
bit of a delay with the cross boundaries there and everything between the U.S. and Canada,

34:47.080 --> 34:50.360
but we really appreciate you being on the program, and thanks for listening in 2007.

34:50.360 --> 34:51.360
Hope you have a great...

34:51.360 --> 34:52.360
Thank you very much for having me.

34:52.360 --> 34:53.360
Not a problem.

34:53.360 --> 34:54.360
Hope you have a great 2008.

34:54.360 --> 34:55.360
Hope I wasn't much more talkative yesterday.

34:55.360 --> 34:56.360
Thanks, bud.

34:56.360 --> 34:57.360
All right.

34:57.360 --> 34:58.360
Take care, buddy.

34:58.360 --> 34:59.360
All right.

34:59.360 --> 35:00.360
You too.

35:00.360 --> 35:01.360
All right.

35:01.360 --> 35:02.360
Bye-bye.

35:02.360 --> 35:05.920
Unfortunately, because of the distance there, he was breaking up a little bit.

35:05.920 --> 35:07.760
All right.

35:07.760 --> 35:08.760
Let's see.

35:08.760 --> 35:11.760
We're going to move on to September.

35:11.760 --> 35:16.000
We're going to get a call here and talk about September and October.

35:16.000 --> 35:19.440
So the Skype line is open at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

35:19.440 --> 35:20.440
September and October.

35:20.440 --> 35:23.860
And remember, if you don't get through for this one, there is still November and December.

35:23.860 --> 35:25.400
We still have that to go over.

35:25.400 --> 35:26.400
So let's see who's on the line.

35:26.400 --> 35:27.400
Hi, you're on Orange House Radio.

35:27.400 --> 35:28.400
Who's this?

35:28.400 --> 35:29.400
Kia68.

35:29.400 --> 35:32.600
Hey, you were the one that was waiting for September, weren't you?

35:32.600 --> 35:33.600
Yeah.

35:33.600 --> 35:34.600
Oh, wow.

35:34.600 --> 35:36.160
You got knocked out, didn't you?

35:36.160 --> 35:37.160
Yeah.

35:37.160 --> 35:38.160
Because somebody else might have beat you to it.

35:38.160 --> 35:39.160
All right.

35:39.160 --> 35:40.160
Well, here it is.

35:40.160 --> 35:41.160
We got September and October.

35:41.160 --> 35:42.160
Let's start with September.

35:42.160 --> 35:43.160
Now, September was our biggest month.

35:43.160 --> 35:46.800
There were five Sundays in the month of September, so we did more shows in September than any

35:46.800 --> 35:48.200
other month.

35:48.200 --> 35:52.520
Starting off with Episode 245, Neo Geo titles were announced for the Nintendo Wii's Virtual

35:52.520 --> 35:53.520
Console.

35:53.520 --> 35:59.200
So of course, a lot of people were like, OMG, Magician's Lair, Magician Lord, and OMG, Fatal

35:59.200 --> 36:00.400
Fury, and all this stuff.

36:00.400 --> 36:07.040
What always surprised me about this was that Fatal Fury is like nine bucks on the Nintendo

36:07.040 --> 36:12.200
Wii, or you can get the souped up version with the improved HD and online play for five

36:12.200 --> 36:13.200
bucks.

36:13.200 --> 36:16.240
Or you can get the original car for like a hundred.

36:16.240 --> 36:20.000
Well, I think that kind of goes out the window now with Virtual Console.

36:20.000 --> 36:23.520
Actually, Jamie, you collect the old school Neo Geo cartridges.

36:23.520 --> 36:24.520
I have some.

36:24.520 --> 36:25.520
You paid hundreds of dollars.

36:25.520 --> 36:27.160
But you do have some that you paid hundreds of dollars for, right?

36:27.160 --> 36:32.960
The only one that I paid, and I got it for two hundred and something, was I got a chance

36:32.960 --> 36:38.840
to buy King of Fighters 2000 for relatively cheap.

36:38.840 --> 36:39.920
Nice.

36:39.920 --> 36:44.280
And so that's the one that we've paid the most for, but we've got like, Samurai Shodown,

36:44.280 --> 36:47.680
Samurai Shodown 2, Baseball Stars.

36:47.680 --> 36:50.560
What do you think, as a collector, what do you think about all this stuff now coming

36:50.560 --> 36:52.960
out on Virtual Console for less than ten bucks?

36:52.960 --> 36:53.960
Good!

36:53.960 --> 36:58.880
Because I don't have the money to spend on this crap, although I did want Samurai Shodown

36:58.880 --> 36:59.880
5.

36:59.880 --> 37:00.880
Right.

37:00.880 --> 37:01.880
I would pay the money for that.

37:01.880 --> 37:02.880
Right.

37:02.880 --> 37:07.400
Well, episode 246 was the episode where Sony was sending out to all the critics out there

37:07.400 --> 37:09.160
a review guide for Lair.

37:09.160 --> 37:11.160
It was just IGN.

37:11.160 --> 37:15.760
Well, IGN kind of like posted it, but they were sending it to several critics, this whole

37:15.760 --> 37:17.280
little guide on Lair.

37:17.280 --> 37:22.000
And they said, no, we're not trying to sway people's decisions, but they just want to

37:22.000 --> 37:25.200
make sure everybody understood the game.

37:25.200 --> 37:26.840
And the six-axis control, right?

37:26.840 --> 37:30.400
But it was a very nicely bound little book.

37:30.400 --> 37:33.440
Episode number 247 was the episode where Project Hammer was cancelled.

37:33.440 --> 37:38.160
I wonder if any of those review guides went on the old eBay.

37:38.160 --> 37:39.560
You know, we never looked.

37:39.560 --> 37:40.560
We should have.

37:40.560 --> 37:41.560
We could have put one up here in the studio.

37:41.560 --> 37:43.560
It would have been fun.

37:43.560 --> 37:46.240
Anyway, 247 was when Project Hammer was cancelled.

37:46.240 --> 37:49.640
This is a game that looked to be a hell of a lot of fun when we saw it at E3, but apparently

37:49.640 --> 37:52.680
somebody at Nintendo decided it wasn't good enough.

37:52.680 --> 37:56.800
Sorry, Project Hammer reminds me too much of MC Hammer, and that's like so ten years

37:56.800 --> 37:57.800
ago.

37:57.800 --> 37:58.800
Exactly.

37:58.800 --> 38:00.560
Project MC Hammer.

38:00.560 --> 38:04.480
Reverend Hammer.

38:04.480 --> 38:09.000
Episode number 248 was the week that Smash Bros. was announced that it was going to be

38:09.000 --> 38:10.600
going online.

38:10.600 --> 38:13.000
And of course, that caused a lot of people to go, whoo!

38:13.000 --> 38:16.560
Of course, later on it was announced that it still has frame codes.

38:16.560 --> 38:24.160
And the whole, the whole like thing with people just getting the computer, taking over and

38:24.160 --> 38:25.160
stuff.

38:25.160 --> 38:26.160
Okay.

38:26.160 --> 38:27.160
Oh yeah, yeah.

38:27.160 --> 38:28.160
That's weird.

38:28.160 --> 38:31.560
I'm trying to get off topic here a little bit, but apparently, what was it, not Brothers

38:31.560 --> 38:38.640
N'Arcs, Medal of Honor 2, or Heroes 2, is online, 32 players, and if I remember correctly,

38:38.640 --> 38:41.880
does not have friends codes for the Wii.

38:41.880 --> 38:42.880
Nice.

38:42.880 --> 38:46.400
So why can't everybody do that?

38:46.400 --> 38:49.960
Your guess is as good as mine.

38:49.960 --> 38:54.880
So that was episode 248, and of course it was a five week month, episode 249, that was

38:54.880 --> 39:00.920
the week that the Sex Pistols, it was announced that they were getting back together to re-record

39:00.920 --> 39:04.340
the song Anarchy in the UK for Guitar Hero 3.

39:04.340 --> 39:08.480
And of course, this is big news, I think, not so much like just the song itself or what

39:08.480 --> 39:13.440
have you, but just the fact that, you know, video games, and especially a series like

39:13.440 --> 39:19.800
Guitar Hero 3 has transcended the music game genre so much that bands that had been broken

39:19.800 --> 39:23.240
up were coming back together for the purposes of recording for the game.

39:23.240 --> 39:27.920
I mean, that in my mind is huge, especially as an old school music gaming fan.

39:27.920 --> 39:34.420
So GS68, those are the five stories we picked, the Neo Geo titles on the Wii, Sony sending

39:34.420 --> 39:38.760
out a review guide for Lair, Project Hammer getting cancelled, Smash Brothers going online,

39:38.760 --> 39:41.120
Sex Pistols re-recording Anarchy in the UK.

39:41.120 --> 39:43.640
Do you think one of those stories was the biggest one out in September, or do you have

39:43.640 --> 39:44.640
your own pick?

39:44.640 --> 39:48.640
I have my own from episode 247, I think.

39:48.640 --> 39:49.640
What's that?

39:49.640 --> 39:54.440
It's one about the New Jersey parents being upset about the Wii Zapper.

39:54.440 --> 39:57.520
You know, I was looking at that one when I was going through the show rules today, yeah,

39:57.520 --> 39:59.920
the New Jersey parents being upset about the Wii Zapper.

39:59.920 --> 40:01.920
Why do you think that was the biggest impact?

40:01.920 --> 40:09.760
Well, I mean, like 20 years ago, the Wii Zapper, I mean, the NES Zapper, I mean, no one complained

40:09.760 --> 40:15.960
about that, and then Super Nintendo had a Super Scope, I don't think anyone complained,

40:15.960 --> 40:22.120
and a whole bunch of systems after that, but, like, a gunproof on the Wii, oh my gosh, you

40:22.120 --> 40:24.120
must ban this.

40:24.120 --> 40:27.880
I have a pick for the new story.

40:27.880 --> 40:28.880
What do you think, Logie?

40:28.880 --> 40:35.800
Halo 3 is released, come on, I mean, seriously, everyone's like, oh my god, Halo 3!

40:35.800 --> 40:38.320
Yeah, but I don't know, well, yeah, it was.

40:38.320 --> 40:43.640
I think the reason why it was overlooked here is because, you know, it kind of, well, no,

40:43.640 --> 40:48.120
it's not that, because I do care about Halo 3, but just that most of the Halo 3 news was

40:48.120 --> 40:52.600
everything leading up to its release, you know what I mean?

40:52.600 --> 40:53.600
Yeah, I wonder.

40:53.600 --> 40:57.600
Okay, how about this, episode, you know, 246 or whatever, it is announced that you cannot

40:57.600 --> 40:59.560
put the helmets on your cat.

40:59.560 --> 41:01.120
But that is disappointing.

41:01.120 --> 41:02.840
Biggest news of the month.

41:02.840 --> 41:06.160
Biggest news of 2007, honestly.

41:06.160 --> 41:08.120
You okay, Jamie?

41:08.120 --> 41:10.520
Blink blink blink.

41:10.520 --> 41:13.400
Would you try to put the helmet on your cat, on Shermie?

41:13.400 --> 41:14.400
Shermie's too stupid.

41:14.400 --> 41:15.400
Yes, GS68.

41:15.400 --> 41:20.520
Wait, can we put it on the, can we put the helmet on the ferret?

41:20.520 --> 41:22.360
Can we put the helmet on the ferret?

41:22.360 --> 41:23.360
We probably could.

41:23.360 --> 41:24.680
If we could find the ferret, we could.

41:24.680 --> 41:28.720
The ferret ran hiding since Rob threatened to put him down the food trash compactor.

41:28.720 --> 41:29.720
I did, I did.

41:29.720 --> 41:32.640
I think, I think Scarecrow's the penguin.

41:32.640 --> 41:34.440
Possibly the new penguin from Argentina.

41:34.440 --> 41:35.840
The penguin is frightening.

41:35.840 --> 41:38.160
He is pretty fierce, he's very punk rock.

41:38.160 --> 41:41.240
Alright, let's go on to October, our show's going to go on all night.

41:41.240 --> 41:46.080
October, episode 250, that was a big week for us, because it was our 250th episode.

41:46.080 --> 41:50.720
That was also the week that Nintendo announced that they were going to be offering what we

41:50.720 --> 41:55.160
call the Wii Condoms, or, you know, the Wii, what are they officially called?

41:55.160 --> 41:57.160
The Wii Sleeves or something like that?

41:57.160 --> 41:58.160
Yeah.

41:58.160 --> 41:59.160
But they look like giant Wii Condoms.

41:59.160 --> 42:00.160
If it's true.

42:00.160 --> 42:03.280
When you mode into the TV, you're probably stupid.

42:03.280 --> 42:04.280
Exactly.

42:04.280 --> 42:06.440
So it was definitely a way of nerfing the Wiimote.

42:06.440 --> 42:09.720
But what was weird about that story is that no one was really expecting it.

42:09.720 --> 42:10.720
You know what I mean?

42:10.720 --> 42:11.720
Like, it came out of nowhere.

42:11.720 --> 42:14.760
And like, it's like, oh, we're going to put out these straps that are better in this.

42:14.760 --> 42:17.360
And then finally, it's like, oh, we're also going to put out these giant things that make

42:17.360 --> 42:19.480
your Wiimote look like it's wrapped in a condom.

42:19.480 --> 42:21.480
And people were like, what?

42:21.480 --> 42:22.480
Why?

42:22.480 --> 42:23.480
This is very interesting.

42:23.480 --> 42:26.880
Episode 251 was- A broken episode.

42:26.880 --> 42:29.560
Yes, that was a broken episode.

42:29.560 --> 42:34.860
And the week that it was announced that Smash Brothers was delayed to 2008.

42:34.860 --> 42:38.240
So Smash Brothers was completely delayed to 2008.

42:38.240 --> 42:43.920
And that did not sit well with a lot of Nintendo Wii fans, sadly.

42:43.920 --> 42:48.680
252 was a very big week, because that was the week that Capcom announced their goodies

42:48.680 --> 42:53.960
for 2008, including Street Fighter IV was announced that week, as well as the next generation

42:53.960 --> 42:55.440
version of Bionic Commando.

42:55.440 --> 42:56.440
Fuck yeah.

42:56.440 --> 42:58.240
Did you see the trailer for that?

42:58.240 --> 42:59.400
Yeah, I've seen that one.

42:59.400 --> 43:00.400
Isn't it pretty?

43:00.400 --> 43:01.400
It is.

43:01.400 --> 43:02.400
And it plays the music.

43:02.400 --> 43:05.800
These little fangasms that we're having now is just reminiscent of what was happening

43:05.800 --> 43:06.800
that third week in October.

43:06.800 --> 43:10.240
I'm so excited right now, and it's going to be very disappointing when the game actually

43:10.240 --> 43:11.240
comes out.

43:11.240 --> 43:13.680
And I wonder if he's going to kill Hitler at the end.

43:13.680 --> 43:14.680
I hope so.

43:14.680 --> 43:16.760
That would be definitely the coup de grace.

43:16.760 --> 43:21.640
And then the last show we taped in October, episode number 253, was the week that it was

43:21.640 --> 43:26.120
discovered that Rock Band and Guitar Hero 3 are not playing nice.

43:26.120 --> 43:29.040
The controllers were not compatible with each other.

43:29.040 --> 43:32.720
If you wanted to play both games, you had to use Guitar Hero 2 controllers, but Guitar

43:32.720 --> 43:36.040
Hero 3 on at least Playstation 3 was not compatible with each other.

43:36.040 --> 43:38.120
We've been using our Xbox ones.

43:38.120 --> 43:40.920
Xbox, I think, works one way, but it doesn't work the other way.

43:40.920 --> 43:41.920
It works with Rock Band.

43:41.920 --> 43:44.760
Yeah, it works with Rock Band, but the controller doesn't work with Guitar Hero 3.

43:44.760 --> 43:47.720
It'd be better if they made a controller that didn't break.

43:47.720 --> 43:51.400
Or just that they just would let them both be, you know, a lot of people are like, this

43:51.400 --> 43:54.160
just sucks that they can't get along.

43:54.160 --> 43:56.140
And I agree, it sucks that they can't get along.

43:56.140 --> 43:59.120
What do you think GS68 was the biggest, or if you have one of your own, feel free to

43:59.120 --> 44:00.120
share.

44:00.120 --> 44:04.360
Nintendo offering Wii Condoms, Smash Brothers delayed, Capcom announces Street Fighter IV

44:04.360 --> 44:08.720
and Bionic Commando, or Rock Band and Guitar Hero 3 just can't play nice.

44:08.720 --> 44:14.020
I'm not too sure, I'm not, I don't really remember October too well.

44:14.020 --> 44:22.560
But I'll probably guess, I'll probably guess Street Fighter IV, the Wiimote gloves, I guess.

44:22.560 --> 44:23.560
The Wiimote gloves?

44:23.560 --> 44:25.480
Yeah, that was pretty big.

44:25.480 --> 44:28.800
I don't know, me personally, I would say the Smash Brothers delay, I know that seems weird

44:28.800 --> 44:33.040
because then you kind of go, well that's a 2008 story, but that was a game that people

44:33.040 --> 44:37.760
were so looking forward to and especially on the Wii that really needed some powerhouse

44:37.760 --> 44:42.120
games, although I guess, I guess it didn't, it did pretty well this Christmas regardless,

44:42.120 --> 44:45.600
but you know, just so many people were looking forward to that game, it was just a real disappointment

44:45.600 --> 44:46.600
when that game got delayed.

44:46.600 --> 44:50.120
If it wasn't for the delay, I'd be playing it right now.

44:50.120 --> 44:51.200
We all would.

44:51.200 --> 44:53.760
We probably wouldn't be doing this show, we would be playing Smash Brothers Brawl right

44:53.760 --> 44:55.000
now.

44:55.000 --> 44:58.960
And that's, you know, again, all the more reason why that game's got to be twice as

44:58.960 --> 45:03.440
good or, you know, people are going to kind of go, oh we waited all this time for this?

45:03.440 --> 45:08.000
Given all these delays, I have a feeling people are going to start calling it Super Smash

45:08.000 --> 45:09.240
Brothers Forever.

45:09.240 --> 45:11.360
I think somebody did earlier in chat actually.

45:11.360 --> 45:12.360
It was me.

45:12.360 --> 45:17.600
Alright, GS68, what in your opinion was the worst freaking game of 2007?

45:17.600 --> 45:25.960
I'll probably have, I haven't played a lot of crappy games that were released in 2007,

45:25.960 --> 45:31.920
but I might have, I'll probably give it to Initial D4.

45:31.920 --> 45:35.760
Initial D4, Initial D4, why Initial D4?

45:35.760 --> 45:43.680
Well, mainly because it was a program, so like, apparently there's this whole speed

45:43.680 --> 45:48.960
limit system where if you go too fast on a certain corner your wheel locks and your acceleration

45:48.960 --> 45:55.880
submers, and there's this penalty cancel glitch where you hit the brake to remove the acceleration

45:55.880 --> 46:02.880
problem, and from what I've read, like, the recent official Initial D tournament is the

46:02.880 --> 46:07.600
last one they're going to do because I've read that Initial D4 stopped doing very well

46:07.600 --> 46:08.600
in Japan.

46:08.600 --> 46:15.240
Like, over in Hong Kong, for example, Version 3 is doing better than Initial D4.

46:15.240 --> 46:17.720
Wow, that is something else.

46:17.720 --> 46:22.840
Well, that's a bummer that it really sucked it up on its fourth version.

46:22.840 --> 46:25.040
I haven't even really played that one.

46:25.040 --> 46:27.240
I've played Initial D3 though, that's a fun time.

46:27.240 --> 46:29.240
Anyway, I'm sorry, go ahead.

46:29.240 --> 46:31.560
Yeah, and what else?

46:31.560 --> 46:48.800
Like, the tuning system for the game, like, if you want to, yeah, sorry.

46:48.800 --> 46:49.800
That's alright.

46:49.800 --> 46:54.000
You were going to say another game that you thought was the worst of the year?

46:54.000 --> 47:02.080
Actually, no, I was going to bring up the whole customizing shop feature, instead of,

47:02.080 --> 47:08.520
you have to eject your card three times just to get to that, so you have to point to the

47:08.520 --> 47:14.560
continue screen, eject your card, and then to play, and then put your coins in, and then

47:14.560 --> 47:19.320
start the game again, so that way you can get to the tuning shop faster.

47:19.320 --> 47:23.640
In other words, it's a way to keep sucking up your money and sucking up your tokens.

47:23.640 --> 47:29.120
Actually, that will only be in the case of if you had discounted continues, like five

47:29.120 --> 47:32.680
points to start and four points to continue.

47:32.680 --> 47:33.680
Interesting.

47:33.680 --> 47:37.760
Well, okay, let's move on and stop talking about games that suck, and let's talk about

47:37.760 --> 47:40.320
the best freaking game of 2007 in your opinion.

47:40.320 --> 47:43.720
What was the best game in your opinion?

47:43.720 --> 47:45.400
Maximum Tune 3.

47:45.400 --> 47:46.640
Interesting.

47:46.640 --> 47:49.980
You must be a real racing game fan, because you got both for your best and worst.

47:49.980 --> 47:53.560
Why was Maximum Tune 3 your best game of the year?

47:53.560 --> 47:57.880
I like what they did with the battle system, like instead of picking a set course, you

47:57.880 --> 48:01.900
can now pick the route like partway through the game.

48:01.900 --> 48:06.920
They also added new courses, like you cannot race on the whole one gun line instead of

48:06.920 --> 48:10.800
just like a six kilometer stretch, which was pretty cool.

48:10.800 --> 48:14.480
The soundtrack was pretty cool, more music-assuring stuff.

48:14.480 --> 48:15.480
Absolutely.

48:15.480 --> 48:22.920
And the ghost battle system, like the idea of racing a virtual opponent instead of them

48:22.920 --> 48:25.400
having to be there.

48:25.400 --> 48:31.800
Yeah, I've been listening to the soundtrack to Maximum Tune 3 in my car recently, actually.

48:31.800 --> 48:34.880
And the thing I find about it, though, is if I listen to it too much, I drive too fast.

48:34.880 --> 48:38.000
I speed way more often when I'm listening to wang game music than anything else, so

48:38.000 --> 48:39.000
there you go.

48:39.000 --> 48:40.000
Well, do you...

48:40.000 --> 48:41.000
Yo, go ahead.

48:41.000 --> 48:46.200
Isn't my CD player like 80 to 90 percent of the time?

48:46.200 --> 48:51.400
I think it's music that was designed to put the pedal to the floor, and it happens in

48:51.400 --> 48:52.400
my real car.

48:52.400 --> 48:53.400
It's an unfortunate thing.

48:53.400 --> 49:04.760
I think the soundtrack and the graphics are meant to give the game a rave-ish look.

49:04.760 --> 49:09.920
Several years ago, there was a game called Wanken Midnight, and the graphics and soundtrack

49:09.920 --> 49:12.320
were nothing like Maximum Tunes.

49:12.320 --> 49:19.360
Well, sometimes it happens that you have a series that's kind of similar, but I don't

49:19.360 --> 49:20.360
know.

49:20.360 --> 49:22.360
What are you talking about?

49:22.360 --> 49:29.320
Like, there were older Wanken Midnight games released in 2001, and they were based on Tokyo

49:29.320 --> 49:31.920
Extreme Racer.

49:31.920 --> 49:37.240
And they looked and sounded nothing like Maximum Tune, because I guess Maximum Tune was made

49:37.240 --> 49:42.240
to be more arcade-friendly.

49:42.240 --> 49:43.240
I guess true.

49:43.240 --> 49:46.760
Well, Wanken Midnight was actually us fighting the stuff on the manga.

49:46.760 --> 49:51.280
Yeah, that was bullshit on manga.

49:51.280 --> 49:55.240
All right, well, hey, GS68, we've got to let you go, because we've got some more months

49:55.240 --> 50:04.720
to go over, but I'll leave you with this thought of us all raving in the car right now.

50:04.720 --> 50:06.400
Let's drop some ecstasy while it's hot.

50:06.400 --> 50:07.400
No, just kidding.

50:07.400 --> 50:08.400
All right.

50:08.400 --> 50:12.200
We've got to let you go, GS68, but thank you so much, and have a great 2008, all right?

50:12.200 --> 50:13.200
Thanks, you too.

50:13.200 --> 50:15.200
All right, take care, buddy.

50:15.200 --> 50:20.560
All right, we're looking for one more call to help us close out the year with November

50:20.560 --> 50:21.560
and December.

50:21.560 --> 50:26.620
If you want to give us a call right now, 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

50:26.620 --> 50:27.620
But we've got our caller.

50:27.620 --> 50:29.000
Hi, who's on the air?

50:29.000 --> 50:30.000
Yeah.

50:30.000 --> 50:32.880
I'd recognize that laugh anywhere.

50:32.880 --> 50:34.800
This is Legend of Zaku, isn't it?

50:34.800 --> 50:36.160
Yes, it is.

50:36.160 --> 50:37.480
What is up, my friend?

50:37.480 --> 50:41.400
Nothing much, just waiting till tomorrow.

50:41.400 --> 50:42.400
What's tomorrow?

50:42.400 --> 50:43.400
Waiting for that ball.

50:43.400 --> 50:47.400
You know, that ball dropping in that middle of that big city on the base of the earth.

50:47.400 --> 50:48.920
Oh, yes, I've heard of that before.

50:48.920 --> 50:52.200
Are you going out to Times Square tomorrow?

50:52.200 --> 50:57.720
Probably not, but I am getting drunk tomorrow legitimately.

50:57.720 --> 50:58.720
You're not drunk now?

50:58.720 --> 50:59.720
With friends, no.

50:59.720 --> 51:01.920
All right, but you'll be drunk tomorrow.

51:01.920 --> 51:08.960
Yeah, just going over the year that was 2007 in gaming.

51:08.960 --> 51:15.000
Are you ready to go over November with us?

51:15.000 --> 51:18.440
I don't have my memory associated, but let's do it.

51:18.440 --> 51:19.520
I'll help you.

51:19.520 --> 51:23.400
I've got four stories here to help remind you what happened in November.

51:23.400 --> 51:40.160
Episode 254 was the week that Manhunt 2 on the PSP was hack-sored to remove some of the

51:40.160 --> 51:48.480
target basically quickly rushed to judgment and pulled it off even though there's no way

51:48.480 --> 51:53.120
in hell you're going to get to it unless you have massive experience in PSP hacking.

51:53.120 --> 51:56.520
But Loki, you did it the day this thing came out, didn't you?

51:56.520 --> 52:02.120
You had your PSP stripped of the censored stuff in it.

52:02.120 --> 52:03.120
Was it worth it?

52:03.120 --> 52:04.120
No.

52:04.120 --> 52:11.360
Was it worth it for fucking genitals getting like, I don't know, basically hurt?

52:11.360 --> 52:14.160
Isn't that what got censored?

52:14.160 --> 52:19.480
Weren't the genitals, what do you call it, hurt?

52:19.480 --> 52:20.480
Yes.

52:20.480 --> 52:22.120
Electrocuted, mashed.

52:22.120 --> 52:24.440
They were ripped off of pliers.

52:24.440 --> 52:25.440
Ew.

52:25.440 --> 52:27.440
Oh, wow.

52:27.440 --> 52:30.800
Yeah, this game sounds pretty horrible.

52:30.800 --> 52:31.840
I didn't even play it.

52:31.840 --> 52:33.440
I don't need to.

52:33.440 --> 52:34.440
Let's see.

52:34.440 --> 52:35.440
Episode number 255.

52:35.440 --> 52:36.440
That was the week.

52:36.440 --> 52:37.440
This was a slow news week.

52:37.440 --> 52:38.720
I didn't have a lot from this week.

52:38.720 --> 52:41.720
NPD withholds sales numbers from the press.

52:41.720 --> 52:47.040
And actually, it is kind of relevant because, you know, obviously it kind of leaves it in

52:47.040 --> 52:49.920
the company's hands to be kind of bragging.

52:49.920 --> 52:53.960
And you've seen companies kind of stretch these reports out a little bit.

52:53.960 --> 52:54.960
Of course.

52:54.960 --> 52:55.960
They want a piece.

52:55.960 --> 52:56.960
They're stockholders.

52:56.960 --> 52:57.960
Exactly.

52:57.960 --> 52:58.960
You don't want to.

52:58.960 --> 52:59.960
What the hell?

52:59.960 --> 53:00.960
Are you at a 7-Eleven or something?

53:00.960 --> 53:04.320
I heard a little phone go off.

53:04.320 --> 53:05.320
Yeah, what's up?

53:05.320 --> 53:07.320
It sounds like the phone's at 7-Eleven when they ring.

53:07.320 --> 53:09.360
Yeah, my phone just went off.

53:09.360 --> 53:10.360
Just keep coming quickly.

53:10.360 --> 53:11.360
Sorry, sir.

53:11.360 --> 53:15.480
But when we say withhold, they didn't withhold everything.

53:15.480 --> 53:20.200
They just reduced some of the information that was going out there and caused the companies

53:20.200 --> 53:21.960
to basically be on their own.

53:21.960 --> 53:24.360
Jesus Christ, you got a beeper too?

53:24.360 --> 53:25.360
Yeah.

53:25.360 --> 53:27.240
He's got a beeper.

53:27.240 --> 53:29.240
Maybe we should get another caller.

53:29.240 --> 53:30.240
He's got a pimp.

53:30.240 --> 53:31.240
All right.

53:31.240 --> 53:32.240
Hold on a second.

53:32.240 --> 53:33.240
I'll be right back.

53:33.240 --> 53:34.240
Yeah.

53:34.240 --> 53:35.240
What happened?

53:35.240 --> 53:36.240
You are not putting us on hold.

53:36.240 --> 53:37.240
We will hang up on you.

53:37.240 --> 53:38.240
Okay.

53:38.240 --> 53:39.240
Okay.

53:39.240 --> 53:40.240
Okay.

53:40.240 --> 53:41.240
Bye.

53:41.240 --> 53:42.240
Yeah.

53:42.240 --> 53:43.240
Hello.

53:43.240 --> 53:44.240
All right.

53:44.240 --> 53:47.240
I can't believe we got put on hold by a caller.

53:47.240 --> 53:48.240
No, no, no.

53:48.240 --> 53:49.240
It was only quickly.

53:49.240 --> 53:50.240
All right.

53:50.240 --> 53:51.240
Let's.

53:51.240 --> 53:52.240
All right.

53:52.240 --> 53:53.240
Let's.

53:53.240 --> 53:54.240
All right.

53:54.240 --> 53:55.240
Ooh.

53:55.240 --> 53:56.240
Strike one, Zaku.

53:56.240 --> 53:57.240
All right.

53:57.240 --> 53:58.240
Episode 256 was the week.

53:58.240 --> 53:59.240
What a way to end the year.

53:59.240 --> 54:00.240
Yeah.

54:00.240 --> 54:01.240
Week number 256.

54:01.240 --> 54:02.240
Episode 256.

54:02.240 --> 54:07.280
That was the week that the Xbox download service was announced on the Xbox 360.

54:07.280 --> 54:11.780
You would be able to download original Xbox games to the service, and of course we've

54:11.780 --> 54:15.360
seen this come out now, and you can get Psychonauts and Indigo Prophecy.

54:15.360 --> 54:18.880
Kind of a way to rediscover Xbox games you may have missed the first time around.

54:18.880 --> 54:22.240
Or for some people, a way overpriced way to do it.

54:22.240 --> 54:23.240
Well, yeah.

54:23.240 --> 54:24.240
Of course.

54:24.240 --> 54:25.240
The marketplace.

54:25.240 --> 54:31.680
So who the hell would put price tags on fucking icons and themes, and basically do it against

54:31.680 --> 54:36.400
the will of game developers as well when they don't want to charge for that shit for downloadable

54:36.400 --> 54:37.400
content?

54:37.400 --> 54:38.400
Loki, do you agree?

54:38.400 --> 54:39.400
You don't.

54:39.400 --> 54:40.400
Like Epic, for example.

54:40.400 --> 54:45.040
They don't want to do that shit, but they're forced to, because they have no choice most

54:45.040 --> 54:46.040
of the time.

54:46.040 --> 54:50.800
Why do you think Unreal Tournament 3 is being held up for the 360, besides the user-created

54:50.800 --> 54:51.800
stuff?

54:51.800 --> 54:55.600
Well, it's being held up because they can't do cross-platform play between the PC and

54:55.600 --> 54:56.600
the PC.

54:56.600 --> 55:00.880
Well, that too, but user-created mods is the other hinging factor.

55:00.880 --> 55:03.440
Well, they can worry about that later.

55:03.440 --> 55:06.320
That's not really a factor to keep it from being released.

55:06.320 --> 55:09.040
Ah, god damn it.

55:09.040 --> 55:10.040
Jesus Christ!

55:10.040 --> 55:12.040
Is someone at the door now?

55:12.040 --> 55:13.280
Just go through the last song.

55:13.280 --> 55:14.280
The last one.

55:14.280 --> 55:15.280
Yes, sir.

55:15.280 --> 55:19.880
Guitar Hero's 80s edition sued because the song is too similar.

55:19.880 --> 55:24.720
The romantic suit Guitar Hero 80s edition, and as we all know they lost, the judge laughed

55:24.720 --> 55:25.720
that out of court.

55:25.720 --> 55:28.680
All right, out of those stories, Van Hunt, too, Guitar Hero.

55:28.680 --> 55:29.680
The first one.

55:29.680 --> 55:33.440
Wait, are you going to give us your best one?

55:33.440 --> 55:36.700
That's why you don't answer the phone.

55:36.700 --> 55:39.440
You let it go to voicemail.

55:39.440 --> 55:48.520
Tony, you're the one that keeps answering the calls for him, man.

55:48.520 --> 55:49.520
That's just not cool.

55:49.520 --> 55:51.040
Dip it in the butt.

55:51.040 --> 55:54.600
That's just not cool.

55:54.600 --> 55:58.000
I'm sorry.

55:58.000 --> 56:01.400
I'm not offended because I think it's hilarious, honestly.

56:01.400 --> 56:02.400
I'm offended.

56:02.400 --> 56:04.480
All right, the first one, bye.

56:04.480 --> 56:06.560
No, no, no, no, no, no.

56:06.560 --> 56:07.560
Fuck that.

56:07.560 --> 56:08.560
I'm doing December.

56:08.560 --> 56:09.880
All right, no, I will see.

56:09.880 --> 56:12.120
Let me open up Skype, see if anybody else wants to call us.

56:12.120 --> 56:13.560
Give it a couple minutes.

56:13.560 --> 56:20.880
One eight seven seven game O-L-R or our user name on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

56:20.880 --> 56:25.520
Act deft in chat says best call ever, ever.

56:25.520 --> 56:31.800
If somebody would like to call us and take Zaku's place, you can call us right now.

56:31.800 --> 56:40.360
One eight seven seven game O-L-R or our user name on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

56:40.360 --> 56:44.120
I'm going to give it like 10 seconds and I'm just going to say, Loki, fuck it, you can

56:44.120 --> 56:45.120
just do it.

56:45.120 --> 56:47.960
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

56:47.960 --> 56:48.960
Who's this?

56:48.960 --> 56:49.960
This is DT.

56:49.960 --> 56:52.360
Praise be to God, Dark Tetsuya.

56:52.360 --> 56:53.920
How are you, my friend?

56:53.920 --> 56:55.760
Oh, good.

56:55.760 --> 56:58.160
Think you can do a better job than the last caller?

56:58.160 --> 56:59.160
Yeah.

56:59.160 --> 57:00.160
All right.

57:00.160 --> 57:02.560
Well, let me recap for you, Dark Tetsuya.

57:02.560 --> 57:04.760
When we left off, we were in November.

57:04.760 --> 57:07.000
Manhunt 2 on the PSP was hacked.

57:07.000 --> 57:11.440
MPD withholds sales numbers from the press, Xbox originals are announced for download

57:11.440 --> 57:16.480
on Xbox 360, and Guitar Hero's 80s edition gets sued because the songs are too similar.

57:16.480 --> 57:19.120
What do you think had the biggest impact in November?

57:19.120 --> 57:22.600
Oh, Manhunt 2, definitely.

57:22.600 --> 57:23.600
Definitely.

57:23.600 --> 57:26.120
Just because of the fallout that came with that, right?

57:26.120 --> 57:27.120
Oh, yeah.

57:27.120 --> 57:28.120
Absolutely.

57:28.120 --> 57:32.600
You would have thought they would have learned with Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, but no.

57:32.600 --> 57:34.960
Oh, no, no.

57:34.960 --> 57:37.680
Everything tells me this won't be the last time, either.

57:37.680 --> 57:38.680
Oh, no.

57:38.680 --> 57:39.680
All right.

57:39.680 --> 57:44.560
Well, then we move on to December, and in December, we had episode number 258.

57:44.560 --> 57:48.440
Now, technically, this happened in November, but we covered it in December, so we're putting

57:48.440 --> 57:50.160
it in December's news.

57:50.160 --> 57:56.480
That was the week that a certain editor was let go from a certain major gaming blog, allegedly

57:56.480 --> 58:00.000
due to a certain review that he had written about a certain game that was being heavily

58:00.000 --> 58:01.680
advertised on the site.

58:01.680 --> 58:02.680
That's right.

58:02.680 --> 58:08.720
That's Jeff Gerstmann, and really, you could just say that name, The Gerstmann Incident,

58:08.720 --> 58:11.880
and have you even seen, now there's movie trailers and shit and everything, like fake

58:11.880 --> 58:12.880
movie trailers?

58:12.880 --> 58:13.880
Yeah, because people have that much free time.

58:13.880 --> 58:19.920
Honestly, though, if no one brought it back up, would you still remember, I completely

58:19.920 --> 58:24.920
forgot about this, and thank God, because all you need to know is not to trust the bigger

58:24.920 --> 58:25.920
sites.

58:25.920 --> 58:26.920
Trust us, because we're awesome.

58:26.920 --> 58:31.480
Well, I stand by what I said before, that there's multiple sides to every story, and

58:31.480 --> 58:36.440
actually, oddly enough, you would think me, of all people, would be the biggest critic

58:36.440 --> 58:40.240
of GameSpot in this situation, but I actually think people didn't give them enough credit.

58:40.240 --> 58:41.240
No.

58:41.240 --> 58:42.880
And I think we're too quick to blame the big corpse.

58:42.880 --> 58:43.880
I just didn't care.

58:43.880 --> 58:45.200
I was getting annoyed at that point.

58:45.200 --> 58:46.760
I'm like, thank God they fired you.

58:46.760 --> 58:48.400
This story's taking too long.

58:48.400 --> 58:51.840
All right, well, there was other news in December.

58:51.840 --> 58:57.880
Episode 259 was Nintendo pulls ads due to the high demand of the Nintendo Wii.

58:57.880 --> 59:03.240
They basically said, okay, we can't make these Wiis fast enough.

59:03.240 --> 59:04.240
Everybody still wants one.

59:04.240 --> 59:07.880
You know, maybe we'll hold off on the advertising until the first quarter next year.

59:07.880 --> 59:08.880
Well, that makes sense.

59:08.880 --> 59:13.200
I mean, if you're going to, you know, you're having no problem selling one item, why do

59:13.200 --> 59:14.520
you need to advertise it?

59:14.520 --> 59:19.240
Advertise it for one, that may not be selling as well, and they have a little bit more of,

59:19.240 --> 59:22.080
so it makes sense to me.

59:22.080 --> 59:28.840
In episode number 260, DVR and internet radio launches on Sony PSPs in Japan.

59:28.840 --> 59:33.480
And funny enough, later that week, internet radio actually followed in the US, and that

59:33.480 --> 59:35.380
was released on the PSPs a little later.

59:35.380 --> 59:40.320
So the PSPs get the doors open to DVR and internet radio in Japan and internet radio

59:40.320 --> 59:41.760
here in the US.

59:41.760 --> 59:48.380
And then that takes us all the way to episode number 261, which was earlier tonight.

59:48.380 --> 59:53.760
And in part A, we talked about Akira Yamaoka comes out and says that Japanese development's

59:53.760 --> 59:57.880
in trouble, and that the American development's where it's at right now, and of course Silent

59:57.880 --> 01:00:00.640
Hill 5 is being developed right here in America.

01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:04.200
What do you think out of those four stories, Dark Tetsuya had the biggest impact on gaming

01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:06.360
in 2007?

01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:11.240
Jeff Gertzman in the fallout there, Nintendo pulling ads due to the Wii demand, DVR and

01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:18.760
internet radio hits the PSP, or Akira Yamaoka saying that development is, it's in America

01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:19.760
is where it's at.

01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:20.760
Oh, Gertzman, definitely.

01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:25.720
Yeah, I think that's kind of a no-brainer, but why do you say that?

01:00:25.720 --> 01:00:28.120
What do you think is the fallout that that could have in 2008?

01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:39.080
Well, I don't know, it was like back in the day, I don't know if you remember, it was

01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:46.280
when EGM gave Super Street Fighter II poor scores, Capcom pulled advertising.

01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:50.240
I don't recall this so much, but now that you're saying it, I kind of go, yeah, you

01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:51.560
know what, that does kind of sound familiar.

01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:55.040
I do remember something like that happening, right?

01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:56.040
Yeah.

01:00:56.040 --> 01:01:01.480
So it kind of just goes to show this is something that kind of has happened before and has kind

01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:07.200
of made a lot of people go, you know, there needs to be responsibility on both ends.

01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:11.540
And again, as I do a lot, I compare things to the movie industry, you know, just because

01:01:11.540 --> 01:01:15.000
Siskel and Ebert might give a movie a bad review, well, Siskel doesn't review anything

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:23.720
anymore, but just because Ebert and Roper, Ebert gives a thumbs up, Siskel's rrrr brains,

01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:29.160
Ebert and Roper might give something a bad review doesn't mean that suddenly, you know,

01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:31.040
they're going to stop advertising in the Chicago newspaper.

01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:36.200
Siskel won't get me out of Ebert's stomach.

01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:42.520
Ah, forget it, it's been plenty of time, it's not too soon anymore.

01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:46.320
I want this show to be over, so we need to get to the best and worst games of the year.

01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:50.960
Dark Tetsuya, in your big opinion, what was the worst freaking game of 2007?

01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:59.480
Oh, God, I hadn't really played all that much, so I guess it goes with Yaris.

01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:01.040
When in doubt, Yaris, right?

01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:02.040
When in doubt.

01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:03.040
Right.

01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:05.960
You drive a car with a claw, enough said.

01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:09.480
Alright, what was the best game of 2007, in your opinion?

01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:15.560
Oh, God, I just rented it, Super Mario Galaxy.

01:02:15.560 --> 01:02:17.120
And why this game?

01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:24.600
Well, it's what Mario 64 2 should have been.

01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:27.160
Instead of what we got on the GameCube, Super Mario Sunshine?

01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:28.160
Yeah.

01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:29.160
Gotcha.

01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:30.160
Exactly.

01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:31.160
Alright.

01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:34.160
Well, anything else you want to share with our listeners?

01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:36.880
No, that's about it.

01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:37.880
Alright.

01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:42.480
Alright, well, Dark Tetsuya, thanks so much for calling and helping us out with the rest

01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:43.480
of the year.

01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:44.480
We appreciate it.

01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:45.480
Have a good one.

01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:46.480
Yeah, you too.

01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:47.480
Alright.

01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:48.480
Take care.

01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:52.760
Dark Tetsuya, of course, writes for our website once in a while when there's news to report

01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:53.760
on.

01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:57.660
Legend of Zaku posted his picks in chat.

01:02:57.660 --> 01:03:01.120
He would have picked God of War 2 for the best game of the year and Kane and Lynch for

01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:02.120
the worst game of the year.

01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:05.640
Well, ha ha, you were answering the phone while you were on the phone with us, so yours

01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:10.000
doesn't count, rude person.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.840
There you have it if you were curious.

01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:15.840
Alright, that took us through the whole year.

01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:16.940
What a trip down memory lane.

01:03:16.940 --> 01:03:18.120
What a long trip down memory lane.

01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:22.360
But it just goes to show us a fucking lot's happened this year.

01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:25.260
A lot's happened this year.

01:03:25.260 --> 01:03:30.280
What do you guys think was the biggest story out of them all?

01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:33.760
What do you think, of all those stories we did tonight, what do you think maybe had the

01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:35.940
most impact in gaming altogether?

01:03:35.940 --> 01:03:39.360
When we called your mom.

01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:42.180
And how did that impact the gaming scene?

01:03:42.180 --> 01:03:46.520
It put me in a good mood and I went home and played a game.

01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:49.320
I hate you.

01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:51.200
We called my mom too.

01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:53.640
What would you say is the story of the year?

01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:57.040
Was it Manhunt 2?

01:03:57.040 --> 01:03:58.800
Was it Smash Brothers getting delayed?

01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:01.500
Was it Codemasters and the broken Bubble Bobble game?

01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:04.100
Was it the lady dying over the Nintendo Wii?

01:04:04.100 --> 01:04:09.360
So many people wanted a Wii that she drank so much she died?

01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:11.360
I think it was Proteus.

01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:12.360
Proteus?

01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:14.560
I would say probably the biggest story of the year.

01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:15.560
I don't know.

01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:18.160
For me, it's the Bubble Bobble thing.

01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:19.160
It really is.

01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:24.100
Because seriously, seriously, how do you do that?

01:04:24.100 --> 01:04:26.040
How does that happen?

01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:27.360
Seriously.

01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:30.240
But that's just me.

01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:31.240
All right.

01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:32.240
Loki?

01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:42.440
I would say, not Bubble Bobble, because seriously, how many people bought Bubble Bobble?

01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:43.440
That affected what?

01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:44.440
Five people?

01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:47.200
Seriously.

01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:57.320
I would say probably, I don't know, the fact that it's a crime that Activision released

01:04:57.320 --> 01:05:02.360
three Guitar Hero games this year.

01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:03.360
Huh?

01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:05.360
Yeah, that's a crime.

01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:12.080
I don't know, let me think.

01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:13.440
Was that last year or this year?

01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:17.400
I can't remember when Red Octane was purchased by Activision.

01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:18.400
Last year?

01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:19.400
That was last year.

01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:20.400
All right.

01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:21.400
Well, let's move on.

01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:25.520
Let's talk about our top five games of the year and our picks for the worst game of the

01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:26.520
year.

01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:27.760
We're just out of the way.

01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:31.320
The worst game of the year, we're going to tally it up with what the listeners say and

01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:32.320
figure it out here.

01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:34.680
DarkStalker, what in your opinion was the worst game of the year?

01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:35.680
The worst game?

01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:36.680
I actually have a list of five.

01:05:36.680 --> 01:05:38.120
You have a list of five?

01:05:38.120 --> 01:05:39.120
All right.

01:05:39.120 --> 01:05:40.120
The worst games of the year.

01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:44.960
I'm going to say Manhunt 2 was one of them, just because I got sick of hearing all the

01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:45.960
crap.

01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:46.960
Imagine Babies.

01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:47.960
Okay.

01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:49.800
Although that was a funny picture with you.

01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:54.200
Anything with the Bratz franchise, and I'll say Yaris too, just because.

01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:56.540
But I got warnings, so I didn't play it.

01:05:56.540 --> 01:06:00.880
And then I have to put this one on here for sauce.

01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:01.880
This is a quote.

01:06:01.880 --> 01:06:06.520
Heroes of Mana is the worst game of 2007 because you need a doctorate in electrical engineering

01:06:06.520 --> 01:06:09.640
to understand how to play the fucking game.

01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:11.120
So I'm going to pick that one.

01:06:11.120 --> 01:06:12.120
Heroes of Mana.

01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:13.120
On her suggestion.

01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:16.160
God damn, the Mana games started sucking after Secret of Mana, didn't they?

01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:17.400
It's very unfortunate.

01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:22.040
I wish that we had gotten Second Sense 3.

01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:24.920
You never know in the virtual console, you never know.

01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:28.160
Loki, your pick for the worst fucking game of 2007.

01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:30.720
I too had five, actually six if you can.

01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:31.960
Jeez, I only had one.

01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:32.960
This is easy.

01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:38.240
Well, I was thinking, okay, my number one is not Yaris.

01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:40.520
But anyways.

01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:46.760
So number six, Off-Road Extreme Special Edition, although I did not play it, but it was horrible.

01:06:46.760 --> 01:06:51.560
I did play this game, Counterforce, for the Wii, yet another game by Conspiracy Entertainment.

01:06:51.560 --> 01:06:55.240
In fact, my number three would be anything from Conspiracy Entertainment.

01:06:55.240 --> 01:06:59.120
Or actually, that'd be number four.

01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:04.800
Number three, I actually, this was the only, the first and only game I will ever import

01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:06.600
for the PS3.

01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:10.520
Wangan Midnight is a fucking joke on the PlayStation 3.

01:07:10.520 --> 01:07:13.640
It is poor for a PlayStation 2 game.

01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:14.640
I hated it.

01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:16.680
It was a waste of $60.

01:07:16.680 --> 01:07:20.960
Yaris is number two, and the reason it's number two is because it's free.

01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:25.680
Number one, I paid fucking $50 for it, and it was a ripoff.

01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:30.880
Transformers The Game, the worst, biggest disappointment of a game this year.

01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:32.120
How do you fuck that up?

01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:34.800
But you did.

01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:39.840
I only had picked one game as the worst game of the year, and I also did not pick Yaris.

01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:41.800
It was tempting, but it was free.

01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:43.040
We do have to remember Yaris was free.

01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:44.040
Yeah, free.

01:07:44.040 --> 01:07:45.120
If it sucked, it's a big deal.

01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:51.400
There is a game that I bought because I was excited at the prospects of the game, and

01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:57.800
the way it was put together and the way it was packaged, it just felt so rushed.

01:07:57.800 --> 01:07:59.760
It was just a steaming pile of poo.

01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:05.680
I hated, I mean, there's not a lot of times I go, I really fucking hate this game.

01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:11.840
I hate Fusion Frenzy 2 so much.

01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:14.980
That game was awful, awful, awful, awful.

01:08:14.980 --> 01:08:18.320
That is definitely the worst game of the year, and I can't believe they would, that's highway

01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:20.520
robbery that they ever tried to charge full price for that game.

01:08:20.520 --> 01:08:22.200
I forgot.

01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:24.160
My wallet was raped by that game.

01:08:24.160 --> 01:08:32.840
I forgot one more honorable mention, I guess, because it is also free.

01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:40.600
You remember the vision camera from Microsoft, which was that totem ball.

01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:41.760
Wasn't the vision cam last year?

01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:42.920
No, it was this year.

01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:43.920
Was it?

01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:44.920
Yeah.

01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:45.920
It was last year.

01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:46.920
It was last year.

01:08:46.920 --> 01:08:47.920
Who gives a shit?

01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:48.920
Totem ball still sucks.

01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:53.480
It sucked in 2007 as well as 2006, all right.

01:08:53.480 --> 01:08:57.320
So when you add it all up though, let's see, you get one vote for Fusion Frenzy 2, one

01:08:57.320 --> 01:09:01.440
vote for Transformers the Game, one vote for Heroes of Mana, one vote for Initial D4, one

01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:04.560
vote for Call of Duty 4, and four votes for Yaris.

01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:11.420
So Yaris gets, definitely runs away with the title of the worst game of 2007.

01:09:11.420 --> 01:09:13.500
How about the best games of 2007?

01:09:13.500 --> 01:09:17.040
Here it is, the time for us to name our five top games of the year.

01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:19.080
Do you want to just name all five at once, Jamie?

01:09:19.080 --> 01:09:20.080
Sure.

01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:22.080
All right, Jamie, give us your top five and why.

01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:26.040
Number five is a wind on two, because when I got to play it, it was pretty fun, although

01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:28.040
I still suck at wind on.

01:09:28.040 --> 01:09:32.440
So four would be Silent Hill Origins, just what I got to see of it again, because I've

01:09:32.440 --> 01:09:34.720
had a really busy, crazy year.

01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:37.520
Three is Super Mario Galaxy, I thought was really cool.

01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:42.080
Two is Rock Band, because again, super cool, and Radiohead.

01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:44.560
And one, Portal, duh.

01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:45.560
So that's it.

01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:46.560
Enough said, huh?

01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:52.560
The Portal was just super innovative, and I love anything that messes with physics.

01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:58.040
I would totally be a physics major if it wasn't for the retarded math.

01:09:58.040 --> 01:10:00.880
All right.

01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:01.880
There you go.

01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:02.880
Loki.

01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:03.880
Okay, like I said.

01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:07.080
Now remember, these are the top five games.

01:10:07.080 --> 01:10:08.920
We can use any criteria we want.

01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:09.920
Exactly.

01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:13.060
They're all in order of just how much fun I've had with them.

01:10:13.060 --> 01:10:18.960
By no means does that mean that they're a great game or that they're impressive to look

01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:20.480
at or anything like that.

01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:23.960
It's just how much fun I've had with each one.

01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:26.360
Number five, Ghost Squad.

01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:32.400
Seriously, one of the most underrated games, at least for the Wii Zapper that's come out

01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:34.420
for the Wii this year, it's cheap.

01:10:34.420 --> 01:10:36.480
It's probably going to get cheaper.

01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:41.600
And granted, the graphics aren't that great, the game is incredibly short, but I will tell

01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:45.160
you, I played that game through like six times in a row.

01:10:45.160 --> 01:10:49.440
The fact that you can unlock like 50 different weapons in the game that makes the games even

01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:54.640
harder, and I don't know, it was the most fun I had for about four hours.

01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:59.200
And that's all I've played of it so far, but Ghost Squad, definitely worth picking up on

01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:02.860
the Wii, if you like gun games.

01:11:02.860 --> 01:11:05.960
Rock Band, fun.

01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:13.800
I have to give it props because I bought Guitar Hero 2, and I bought Guitar Hero for the Playstation,

01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:18.520
I played it like once, and I said fuck this, and put it down, and that's where it gathered

01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:19.520
dust.

01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:24.520
Rock Band actually played for a lot more than that, and it's actually pretty fun.

01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:27.800
Just wish there was an easier way to be able to play online with multiple people, like

01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:33.880
in a world mode or something like that, but definitely a fun game, and it's actually one

01:11:33.880 --> 01:11:37.240
of the games I actually look forward to the download content coming out for it, which

01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:42.480
I can't really say bad about many other games.

01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:47.120
Let's see here, Bioshock, it was a great game while it lasted.

01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:54.000
I thought maybe a little bit short, not a whole lot of replayability, but I had fun

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:55.000
while playing it.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
Alright, and that takes us to number one.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.040
No, that's number three.

01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:00.880
I can't count, okay.

01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:02.360
Number two, Crackdown.

01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:07.960
The best thing for a futuristic Grand Theft Auto, absolutely fun.

01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:12.920
The most fun I've had in a demo for a game, ever.

01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:18.200
Absolutely fun to play online, of course that fizzles away pretty quick, and the game kind

01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:19.200
of got repetitive.

01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:22.440
Had some pretty good download content for it, I actually went back to it because I thought

01:12:22.440 --> 01:12:27.220
my save had gotten corrupted, luckily all that happened was I erased an update once

01:12:27.220 --> 01:12:29.760
I downloaded that again, it worked just fine.

01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:34.560
Real fun game to play online, and then of course that takes me to number one, and once

01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:42.480
again, the game did not have good graphics, the game had really crappy AI, the game is

01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:48.680
extremely cheesy, but I cannot tell you how many fucking hours I've played this game,

01:12:48.680 --> 01:12:54.580
just to beat it, just to unlock all the weapons, just to try to get the five achievements that

01:12:54.580 --> 01:12:56.320
are in it.

01:12:56.320 --> 01:13:01.960
Earth Defense Force 2017, absolutely the best $20 you'll ever spend, if you find it used

01:13:01.960 --> 01:13:05.200
you can probably find it for even cheaper than that.

01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:10.000
D3 really, really, really needs to bring over the simple series over here, because it's

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:16.280
absolutely good money, it's the cheesiest, weirdest games you'll ever play, and unfortunately

01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:22.440
because they're so weird they don't end up coming over here, but I hope that changes.

01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:25.560
My turn, top five games of the year.

01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:28.840
I'm not surprised, Earth Defense Force 2017, for you, because you are a guy that's all

01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:32.020
about fun, and you know, blowing shit up is fun.

01:13:32.020 --> 01:13:35.920
You can blow up, you can level entire cities, and then they come back to the next level,

01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:37.720
and you can level them all over again.

01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:44.240
It's seriously, we've played it for, I don't know how many hours, I have it logged in the

01:13:44.240 --> 01:13:47.680
game, it's over 70 hours, I know that.

01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:55.880
My number five game of the year is a game that really transcended that kind of what

01:13:55.880 --> 01:14:01.800
is a casual game and what is a hardcore game type of thing, and the thing I think that

01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:06.680
makes this game great is that it's really a game that anybody can get into, and it took

01:14:06.680 --> 01:14:12.140
this game that had no depth at all, and gave it an amazing amount of depth, and that's

01:14:12.140 --> 01:14:18.480
Puzzle Quest, was an amazing game that bejeweled and just put little twists on it that made

01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:23.040
a whole role-playing game out of it, and a more competitive type of game out of it, that

01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:26.960
made this game a hell of a lot of fun, and I've watched my roommate spend countless hours

01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:29.680
on Puzzle Quest, he doesn't play anything else but Puzzle Quest.

01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:33.300
There's certainly a lot of people who may not even be into games otherwise that Puzzle

01:14:33.300 --> 01:14:38.240
Quest has kind of brought them in, so Puzzle Quest obviously was released on damn near

01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:42.900
every system this year because there was just that much demand for it, so Puzzle Quest was

01:14:42.900 --> 01:14:46.760
an amazing game, it was my number five game of the year.

01:14:46.760 --> 01:14:50.520
My number four game of the year is one of those games that probably most critics aren't

01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:58.240
even going to put on their top ten, but for me it was so great to finally see a true Japanese

01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:02.440
role-playing style game on a next-gen console and to see what it could do, and I thought

01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:09.880
the story in this game was so amazing, yet kind of depressing, and the way that it wove

01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:16.120
real life in with this fictional scenario was just something really innovative and new,

01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:20.920
and that's why Eternal Sonata for me was just a different type of gaming experience that

01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:26.580
I really enjoyed and had to be in my top five for the year, absolutely.

01:15:26.580 --> 01:15:31.960
Say what you want about it getting stale towards the end or what have you, or how insanely

01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:36.320
difficult and, or not so much difficult but how redundant some of the battles can get

01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:44.640
later on, but Eternal Sonata is just an amazing game that I would play more and more.

01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:48.520
My number three game has been lauded by a lot of people as one of the best games of

01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:55.400
the year, and you know, it deserves to be here graphically, it's a triumph.

01:15:55.400 --> 01:16:01.600
The mood this game creates, few games are able to pull off, and it's something I don't

01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:06.240
usually experience outside of a Silent Hill game, but Bioshock totally scared the hell

01:16:06.240 --> 01:16:11.680
out of me the first time I played it, because it is a scary fucking game, and it really

01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:17.360
is kind of like playing a movie, it really is, so Bioshock is just amazing.

01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:21.760
My number two game of the year is all about fun, and I just, I did not think that this

01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:25.800
game was going to be so great because my expectations I guess were actually a little bit low because

01:16:25.800 --> 01:16:30.720
like I said earlier in the show, I was not a big fan of Mario 64 as much as the next

01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:36.800
guy, but Super Mario Galaxy just blew me away, it is so much fun and is really the type of

01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:41.240
game that I think the Wii was built for, so Super Mario Galaxy is absolutely my number

01:16:41.240 --> 01:16:42.240
two game of the year.

01:16:42.240 --> 01:16:49.360
And that takes me to number one game of the year, I admit it, I do not like to spend as

01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:54.400
much money as I do on gaming, I spend a lot of money on games, and that is why value is

01:16:54.400 --> 01:17:01.680
so important to me, and in my opinion, there is no better value out there in gaming right

01:17:01.680 --> 01:17:06.800
now, period, than the Orange Box, and that is one of the sole reasons why the Orange

01:17:06.800 --> 01:17:10.840
Box is my game of the year, because you get these great, obviously Half Life is an incredible

01:17:10.840 --> 01:17:18.520
series of games, Team Fortress 2, a lot of fun, the unique art style of Team Fortress

01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:29.840
2 really sets it apart from the other games, and of course Portal, when you play Portal

01:17:29.840 --> 01:17:34.320
you feel like you are starting to play the next great series of games, like something

01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:39.520
truly original has started with Portal that I think is going to continue, and you have

01:17:39.520 --> 01:17:45.400
all these in-jokes and the whole the cake is a lie, and not every game, especially its

01:17:45.400 --> 01:17:53.240
first time out the gate, can create that kind of buzz, so the Orange Box absolutely is the

01:17:53.240 --> 01:17:56.460
best game that came out in 2007, it is not only the best deal in gaming, but just some

01:17:56.460 --> 01:18:01.740
of the most solid games you are going to get, and the best 60 bucks you can spend on games,

01:18:01.740 --> 01:18:08.960
so there it is, my top 5 games of the year, so let us tally it up, we have one vote for

01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:17.400
Call of Duty 4, one vote for Maximum Tune 3, one vote for Earth Defense Force 2017, two

01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:23.040
votes for Super Mario Galaxy, but if you combine Portal with Orange Box you get four votes

01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:26.560
for Portal and Orange Box this year, so I am going to have to say that Orange Box is

01:18:26.560 --> 01:18:29.480
collectively Orange Launch Radio's game of the year.

01:18:29.480 --> 01:18:35.560
I did say Half Life 2 earlier for one of my ones that did not make the list, it is part

01:18:35.560 --> 01:18:43.320
of the game, it is ironic, because I remember when I first heard about this game, the Orange

01:18:43.320 --> 01:18:46.160
Box, I was like, oh isn't that funny, we are Orange Launch Radio and here is this game

01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:50.040
the Orange Box, I built a computer called the Orange Box, and what is also funny about

01:18:50.040 --> 01:18:53.820
it is that I remember saying, I was kind of like, oh these are the, oh I am not really

01:18:53.820 --> 01:18:58.080
into these kind of games, I don't really like the first person shooters, Portal, it is a

01:18:58.080 --> 01:19:02.800
shooter, I am not going to like that, Portal makes me enjoy first person shooters, because

01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:07.140
it is a different, I mean I think even people that don't enjoy first person shooters can

01:19:07.140 --> 01:19:09.920
enjoy Portal, and that is what makes the game so great.

01:19:09.920 --> 01:19:15.680
There you have it, the Orange Box, and no we are not changing our name to Orange Box

01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:20.080
Lounge Radio, that would be no fun at all, but the Orange Box is collectively our game

01:19:20.080 --> 01:19:23.200
of the year.

01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:28.800
Which takes us to 2008, what do you guys think, what do you think is going to happen in 2008,

01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:34.800
any predictions you want to make for 2008, Loki?

01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:47.860
I don't know, gosh, probably see the DS redesigned again, I don't know, they need to put out

01:19:47.860 --> 01:19:53.000
some good games for the PS3, or else they are going to be hurting, I know we will see

01:19:53.000 --> 01:20:02.760
Metal Gear Solid 4 come out, Grand Theft Auto will probably push to fall, bastards, Halo

01:20:02.760 --> 01:20:07.680
Wars probably coming out towards the end of the year, hopefully Fable 2, hopefully Spore

01:20:07.680 --> 01:20:12.480
actually makes it out this spring, because I need a good game to run on my new PC, and

01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:20.720
then I might hear about another portable platform or something like that, maybe they will redesign

01:20:20.720 --> 01:20:26.340
an online service like Nintendo Mail, Nintendo really needs to do something with their online

01:20:26.340 --> 01:20:39.680
service, I don't know, you might see a blue and black DS in February, I don't know.

01:20:39.680 --> 01:20:46.520
Dark Sakura, any predictions you want to make for the year 2008, Duke Nukem, Duke Nukem

01:20:46.520 --> 01:20:53.240
Forever will fucking come out at some point, and it will be disappointing.

01:20:53.240 --> 01:21:00.640
I think that Super Smash Brothers Brawl will get pushed again, I keep expecting it.

01:21:00.640 --> 01:21:04.000
You know what, here is something that is kind of interesting, and I have actually looked

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:10.120
at it, I have been kind of following it a little bit, I loved Saints Row, and we still

01:21:10.120 --> 01:21:16.600
play it every day, it kind of is holding us over until Grand Theft Auto IV, but at the

01:21:16.600 --> 01:21:24.920
same time, Saints Row 2 is supposed to be coming out, I think this year, or 2008, and

01:21:24.920 --> 01:21:29.080
it actually looks pretty good, and I'm kind of wondering, I know Grand Theft Auto IV is

01:21:29.080 --> 01:21:35.440
going to be amazing, but Saints Row 2 can be a really good contender for it, especially

01:21:35.440 --> 01:21:43.920
if that gets pushed back to October or something for Grand Theft Auto IV, that game might surprise

01:21:43.920 --> 01:21:47.520
people, I know they're going to plan on doing co-op through the entire story mode, just

01:21:47.520 --> 01:21:52.560
like Crackdown, which is an excellent idea, and then they're going to tweak the online

01:21:52.560 --> 01:21:59.700
play a little bit more and stuff like that, but I think it's awesome, I can't wait.

01:21:59.700 --> 01:22:05.640
Because I'm going to make, in the third or fourth quarter of 2008, Sony will redesign

01:22:05.640 --> 01:22:11.600
the PlayStation 3 and do an effective relaunch, a reboot of the system, the way maybe they

01:22:11.600 --> 01:22:15.780
should have done it the first time, and the reboot will include a playable demo of Final

01:22:15.780 --> 01:22:21.040
Fantasy XIII that's going to blow everybody away, but Metal Gear Solid 4 will not single-handedly

01:22:21.040 --> 01:22:25.000
save the PlayStation 3, and that's what's going to want to cause them to really cut

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:29.080
corners in the cost, and they're going to release the system just as dirt-cheap as possible,

01:22:29.080 --> 01:22:33.800
to try and get people to buy it.

01:22:33.800 --> 01:22:38.960
Somebody will challenge Nintendo to the throne of handheld gaming, and it won't be Sony.

01:22:38.960 --> 01:22:43.120
I think in 2008, I think this year, this is a very just out there prediction, I don't

01:22:43.120 --> 01:22:46.600
know, I get the feeling Nintendo has such a large share of the marketplace in handheld,

01:22:46.600 --> 01:22:52.380
I think someone else wants a piece of that besides Sony, but I don't think it's Microsoft.

01:22:52.380 --> 01:22:57.000
I think someone else, I think someone we don't know about yet, is going to come in and challenge

01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:03.960
Nintendo for the throne in 2008.

01:23:03.960 --> 01:23:10.840
You know what, and a lot of folks in the chat room are insinuating it might be Sega, maybe.

01:23:10.840 --> 01:23:14.640
I don't know, I don't know, I mean their games have not been, but I don't know.

01:23:14.640 --> 01:23:17.920
Because Sega and Nintendo have been kind of working together, you know, and Sega also

01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:20.840
have tried handheld and they failed, so I don't know.

01:23:20.840 --> 01:23:25.120
I don't say no, but I don't think it would be Sega, but I think somebody, I don't think

01:23:25.120 --> 01:23:27.000
it's going to be someone that's known for gaming.

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.380
I think it's going to be somebody that's known for electronics.

01:23:29.380 --> 01:23:33.300
It's going to try and get in here, kind of like what Sony did when they got into the

01:23:33.300 --> 01:23:34.300
gaming market.

01:23:34.300 --> 01:23:37.600
I think somebody who is known for electronics now is going to try to challenge Nintendo

01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:39.800
for the gaming throne, but we'll see.

01:23:39.800 --> 01:23:41.380
For handheld gaming.

01:23:41.380 --> 01:23:46.080
I think the Wii colors will come out finally this year, and I think they'll come out just

01:23:46.080 --> 01:23:49.000
in time for the holiday season, and you're going to get the Wiis in the different colors

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:54.540
finally, and I think something will happen to address the storage issues on the Wii.

01:23:54.540 --> 01:23:59.540
I think, I don't know if the color systems are going to necessarily come with more on-board

01:23:59.540 --> 01:24:03.640
memory, I have a feeling they will, but it's not going to be a major increase, just a slight

01:24:03.640 --> 01:24:04.640
one.

01:24:04.640 --> 01:24:05.640
Like what do they have now, 512 megs?

01:24:05.640 --> 01:24:06.640
Yeah, 512.

01:24:06.640 --> 01:24:11.980
I say they up the internal memory to 2 gigs, but there will be a firmware that will improve

01:24:11.980 --> 01:24:12.980
the SD card support.

01:24:12.980 --> 01:24:20.020
I can see that because with the price of flash ram, I mean, it's going to, it gets cheaper

01:24:20.020 --> 01:24:23.580
every day, so I wouldn't see why they wouldn't do that.

01:24:23.580 --> 01:24:29.100
I can also see on the DS with the on-board storage for downloadable games, virtual console

01:24:29.100 --> 01:24:32.300
for the DS, so to speak, I guess.

01:24:32.300 --> 01:24:38.300
I can see something definitely like that, I'm trying to think what else would be, PlayStation

01:24:38.300 --> 01:24:45.260
redesign, I can see that, might even see a 360 redesign, especially if they get it cooler

01:24:45.260 --> 01:24:48.420
and stuff.

01:24:48.420 --> 01:24:51.800
And let's see, I don't want to take this on too much longer with just predictions I'm

01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:55.540
pulling out of my ass, but just, you know, I think there's a possibility some of these

01:24:55.540 --> 01:24:56.540
things will happen.

01:24:56.540 --> 01:25:02.900
I think Nintendo, I think the big Christmas game they're going to reveal, I think Animal

01:25:02.900 --> 01:25:07.040
Crossing is going to be their big winner game, and I think it is going to be an MMO, and

01:25:07.040 --> 01:25:09.500
it is going to be a bit MySpace-y.

01:25:09.500 --> 01:25:13.860
I think there is going to be a social element to it that no other game is really done yet.

01:25:13.860 --> 01:25:16.540
I think that's going to be their big winner game.

01:25:16.540 --> 01:25:21.420
But I also think this will be the year that Kid Icarus is finally revived.

01:25:21.420 --> 01:25:22.420
I don't know.

01:25:22.420 --> 01:25:23.420
Call it my gut.

01:25:23.420 --> 01:25:26.220
And Guardian Legend finally comes to Virtual Console and we all collectively orgasm.

01:25:26.220 --> 01:25:29.220
I can see them coming out with some more peripherals for the system.

01:25:29.220 --> 01:25:30.220
They've got to.

01:25:30.220 --> 01:25:32.700
I mean, what, the nunchuck and, you know, classic controller?

01:25:32.700 --> 01:25:35.880
I mean, come on, you guys, seriously.

01:25:35.880 --> 01:25:40.420
I want to fucking redesign the damn remote to, or make a gun thing.

01:25:40.420 --> 01:25:43.780
I'm surprised someone hasn't hacked the remote yet to figure out how to get, you know, key

01:25:43.780 --> 01:25:49.040
presses from there, because through that one port there to remove, like, the B button back

01:25:49.040 --> 01:25:53.060
to where Trigger is, like the actual Zapper gun, because apparently that probably could

01:25:53.060 --> 01:25:54.060
have been done.

01:25:54.060 --> 01:25:55.740
I don't know.

01:25:55.740 --> 01:25:56.740
But...

01:25:56.740 --> 01:26:00.420
And not to leave Microsoft out, I'm going to make a bold prediction for them.

01:26:00.420 --> 01:26:04.420
I say because this latest update has shown that they can do buffering video and they

01:26:04.420 --> 01:26:08.740
can do it very well, like if you watch the Inside Xbox stuff, that all works out very

01:26:08.740 --> 01:26:09.740
well.

01:26:09.740 --> 01:26:13.900
I think Microsoft is going to make a Web 2.0 move this year and I think you're going to

01:26:13.900 --> 01:26:18.100
see something YouTubey come to the Xbox 360.

01:26:18.100 --> 01:26:21.380
And it's going to be the reason to get a camera if you don't already have one.

01:26:21.380 --> 01:26:25.220
I think something YouTubey is going to happen on Xbox 360 in either the spring or the fall

01:26:25.220 --> 01:26:26.220
update.

01:26:26.220 --> 01:26:29.220
So, we'll see.

01:26:29.220 --> 01:26:30.980
All right.

01:26:30.980 --> 01:26:34.220
So those are our bold 2008 predictions.

01:26:34.220 --> 01:26:38.220
And there's one more thing we could not do a show without.

01:26:38.220 --> 01:26:41.980
It just would not be a show if we did not do the FUs of the week.

01:26:41.980 --> 01:26:46.980
But this week it's very special because these are the FUs of the year.

01:26:46.980 --> 01:26:50.220
So these are the things that have pissed us off the most above anything else the entire

01:26:50.220 --> 01:26:51.220
year.

01:26:51.220 --> 01:26:54.940
Dark Soccer, I want you to start us off tonight with the FUs of the year.

01:26:54.940 --> 01:27:15.860
I guess my FU of the year is going to go towards the city of Citrus Heights for the crap they're

01:27:15.860 --> 01:27:21.420
doing regarding massage therapist business licenses just because that completely interferes

01:27:21.420 --> 01:27:26.260
with a year's worth of hard work I've put into making my business happen.

01:27:26.260 --> 01:27:29.260
So fuck you.

01:27:29.260 --> 01:27:30.260
All right.

01:27:30.260 --> 01:27:31.900
Loki, your FU of the year.

01:27:31.900 --> 01:27:35.680
I don't have anything that's like really all consuming for the entire year.

01:27:35.680 --> 01:27:40.940
But for this week at least, FU at Nvidia and your crappy graphics drivers because for whatever

01:27:40.940 --> 01:27:46.180
reason whenever I reboot my computer, not only does it not save my settings to what

01:27:46.180 --> 01:27:52.540
screen resolution I have, if it did for whatever reason actually boot up in my desired resolution,

01:27:52.540 --> 01:27:57.860
it flashes black and then back to the picture and blacks out again and constantly does that

01:27:57.860 --> 01:28:03.540
until I change the graphics to a different aspect ratio and then change it back.

01:28:03.540 --> 01:28:07.380
It's fucking annoying.

01:28:07.380 --> 01:28:15.260
And my FU of the year goes to bugs because bugs suck, especially flies that fly around

01:28:15.260 --> 01:28:18.180
in the room when you're trying to do a show.

01:28:18.180 --> 01:28:19.700
All right.

01:28:19.700 --> 01:28:24.700
That's going to do it unless there's any last minute things anybody wants to say.

01:28:24.700 --> 01:28:25.700
Sure.

01:28:25.700 --> 01:28:26.700
Who knew?

01:28:26.700 --> 01:28:27.700
All right, Loki.

01:28:27.700 --> 01:28:31.940
In case you didn't catch that earlier when I was talking about it, No More Heroes has

01:28:31.940 --> 01:28:35.880
moved up to January or at least the end of January, so it's moved up a week.

01:28:35.880 --> 01:28:39.500
So hooray, get to play the game even sooner in the United States.

01:28:39.500 --> 01:28:43.500
Apparently there's a thing going around right now where some of the nunchucks that Nintendo

01:28:43.500 --> 01:28:49.220
has put out recently, I don't know if it's the coloring or something, but they're becoming

01:28:49.220 --> 01:28:51.780
discolored like pink.

01:28:51.780 --> 01:28:53.360
That's kind of funny.

01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:56.660
So they're less manly.

01:28:56.660 --> 01:28:59.180
And then I don't know if anyone saw this.

01:28:59.180 --> 01:29:03.420
Apparently there is a company called PEGA and they're releasing yet another gun peripheral

01:29:03.420 --> 01:29:05.100
for the Wii.

01:29:05.100 --> 01:29:08.380
This one, though, is shaped like a shark.

01:29:08.380 --> 01:29:11.180
It's called the Shark Gun.

01:29:11.180 --> 01:29:16.740
In fact, they were actually, they had a whole press release for this thing.

01:29:16.740 --> 01:29:18.220
It was hilarious.

01:29:18.220 --> 01:29:25.220
They had something, was it, during the gun fighting game, use the Wii remote, nunchuck,

01:29:25.220 --> 01:29:30.040
and shark gun together, holding the handle of the shark gun and poking the trigger with

01:29:30.040 --> 01:29:32.060
your forefinger to shoot.

01:29:32.060 --> 01:29:38.900
We'll bring you a you are there feeling.

01:29:38.900 --> 01:29:44.060
But it's funny though because they have military guys on the cover shooting guns and stuff,

01:29:44.060 --> 01:29:45.740
although they're not the shark gun.

01:29:45.740 --> 01:29:50.260
So it'd be funny if the military had shark guns.

01:29:50.260 --> 01:29:51.260
All right, that's enough news.

01:29:51.260 --> 01:29:52.340
It can wait until next week.

01:29:52.340 --> 01:29:56.660
Next week on Orange Lounge Radio, we're back to our classic format.

01:29:56.660 --> 01:29:59.260
All three of us will be discussing the latest and greatest in gaming news.

01:29:59.260 --> 01:30:03.540
Of course, your call's on Skype as always, and who knows who might put us on hold next

01:30:03.540 --> 01:30:04.540
week.

01:30:04.540 --> 01:30:05.540
We'll see.

01:30:05.540 --> 01:30:06.540
Wait, wait, wait.

01:30:06.540 --> 01:30:07.540
I got one more thing on the Shark Gun.

01:30:07.540 --> 01:30:08.540
God damn it.

01:30:08.540 --> 01:30:09.540
Sorry, this is funny.

01:30:09.540 --> 01:30:10.540
It's one of the features on there.

01:30:10.540 --> 01:30:13.340
With lively appearance and smooth lines, Shark Gun makes you feel comfortable and gives you

01:30:13.340 --> 01:30:18.880
a strong sense of shark-like invincible force.

01:30:18.880 --> 01:30:19.880
That isn't a new name.

01:30:19.880 --> 01:30:20.880
I don't know what is.

01:30:20.880 --> 01:30:25.860
Let's get around, go around and get everybody's final thoughts until next year.

01:30:25.860 --> 01:30:28.700
I'll start off because I was going last for most of the other stuff.

01:30:28.700 --> 01:30:33.020
So my final thought is I want more penguins.

01:30:33.020 --> 01:30:34.780
I want a real one to live in the garage.

01:30:34.780 --> 01:30:35.780
That's what I want.

01:30:35.780 --> 01:30:38.260
DarkSakara, what's your final thought?

01:30:38.260 --> 01:30:40.300
I want money.

01:30:40.300 --> 01:30:41.300
Give me.

01:30:41.300 --> 01:30:42.300
Money is good.

01:30:42.300 --> 01:30:43.300
Loki, your final thought?

01:30:43.300 --> 01:30:48.100
My prediction for 2008, Dusk Cap 4.

01:30:48.100 --> 01:30:49.580
I have one more actually.

01:30:49.580 --> 01:30:50.580
Oh, yes.

01:30:50.580 --> 01:30:51.580
Reject false icons.

01:30:51.580 --> 01:30:54.900
It's been a while since we've had a good, hearty reject false icons.

01:30:54.900 --> 01:30:55.900
It's good.

01:30:55.900 --> 01:31:02.140
All right, for myself, DarkSakara and Loki, everybody please have a happy and very safe

01:31:02.140 --> 01:31:04.580
New Year's Eve, New Year's Day.

01:31:04.580 --> 01:31:08.900
Please don't drink and drive because if you do, you're retarded.

01:31:08.900 --> 01:31:09.900
That's really it.

01:31:09.900 --> 01:31:15.180
We'll see you guys in 2008 for our sixth year of broadcasting, if you can believe it.

01:31:15.180 --> 01:31:18.020
We'll be back next week here on Orange Lounge Radio.
