00:15.000 --> 00:19.500
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:19.500 --> 00:25.500
And welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio. We are live on this Sunday evening, December 2nd of 2007.

00:25.500 --> 00:27.000
The year's almost up.

00:27.000 --> 00:32.000
We'll be doing our year-end special before you know it. We'll announce more details on that in the upcoming weeks.

00:32.000 --> 00:35.000
When Dark Sakura returns to us, hopefully next week.

00:35.000 --> 00:38.000
But in the meantime, we get back into the gaming news for this week.

00:38.000 --> 00:39.500
And Loki's going to start us off.

00:39.500 --> 00:46.000
Let's see. Let's start off with talking a little bit about the Xbox 360 Fall Dashboard Update.

00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
It's going to add a lot of fun things and now they've fleshed out all the details.

00:50.000 --> 00:57.000
Including in the Dashboard Update, Divix support and Xvid support.

00:57.000 --> 01:03.000
So now we can play all the porn that we downloaded on our computers on our 360. Hell yeah.

01:03.000 --> 01:08.000
And then of course the Xbox Live Arcade hits.

01:08.000 --> 01:13.000
Those are going to be reduced price games that basically have been released before.

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
Sold lots of copies and now you can buy them cheaper.

01:16.000 --> 01:20.000
I believe some of those Bank Shop Billiards.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
Two's going to be like 800 points.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
Luminous Live, 800 points.

01:26.000 --> 01:30.000
And then there's going to be a couple for 400 like Zuma and stuff like that.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
But that's not really part of a Dashboard Update. That's just kind of a...

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
Well the section that they're going to have for it.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
It's going to basically be...

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
Oh they're going to have a whole section for it.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
Oh okay.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
Yeah so that's new.

01:43.000 --> 01:47.000
Other things that they're going to be changing. The marketplace is kind of getting a whole facelift.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
They're going to have things sorted completely differently.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
In fact they're going to also have...

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
Are they going to make heads or tails of the movies on there?

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
Because the movies... trying to find movies right now is not what you see.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
I don't know about the movies stuff.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
But they're going to have this kind of thing where you can...

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
I guess people are kind of calling it like a cross media bar.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
It's you know...

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
Ways of sorting the live marketplace stuff.

02:09.000 --> 02:13.000
They have a whole section for free shit. So that's kind of cool.

02:13.000 --> 02:17.000
Other things. Xbox Live Originals of course is coming up there.

02:17.000 --> 02:21.000
The parental timer as well. Friends of Friends.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
By the way the parental timer made the front page of Yahoo today.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
I don't know if you saw that.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
I don't know if you visit Yahoo but it's like my home page.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
So it comes up and...

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
It was mentioning...

02:31.000 --> 02:37.000
Oh the new Xbox will limit how much your kids can play games.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
Kind of interesting.

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
The Friends of Friends functionality where you can actually say for example...

02:43.000 --> 02:47.000
Rob I have a lot of people that are probably on your friends list that I don't have a friend into mine.

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
If you have that enabled I can look at your friends list.

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
See who's on and add people off that.

02:53.000 --> 02:58.000
Also there's going to be a section where you can add a bio to your user tag.

02:58.000 --> 03:02.000
Where you can actually have a thousand words or whatever in there.

03:02.000 --> 03:08.000
There's also going to be a section where you can put your real name and where you're locating stuff if you wanted to.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
If I want people to know that about me.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
If you want people to know that about you.

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
What else do they have in there?

03:15.000 --> 03:19.000
I want to say I set that functionality to friends only earlier this week when the email went out.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
I don't know it's just a little weird.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
So when are they going to let you...

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
They're trying to turn the Xbox into MySpace.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
That's exactly what I was going to say.

03:27.000 --> 03:32.000
In a way well I mean it's smart they're capitalizing on that whole social networking phenomenon.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
But you know I don't know.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
It's not MySpace.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
It's really not.

03:37.000 --> 03:45.000
Can I remake my profile to look god awfully ugly and little like flash graphics and web bling and glitter graphics?

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
I have a completely...

03:46.000 --> 03:49.000
Oh man we should have brought that up during the break.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
Never mind.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
I'll bring it up maybe an afterword.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
Other things that they're changing too.

03:54.000 --> 04:00.000
They're going to add a new Xbox Live blade where it's going to have RSS feeds.

04:00.000 --> 04:05.000
Including you know stuff from like Major Nelson and other tidbits of information.

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
And or advertisements.

04:08.000 --> 04:12.000
Let's see.

04:12.000 --> 04:16.000
Yeah I think that's pretty much it.

04:16.000 --> 04:20.000
And of course this is all going to be available Tuesday.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
Nice.

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
Yeah Frisbee says in chat room.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
chat.orangesonshare.com

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
Thanks for the ad.

04:28.000 --> 04:32.000
Can we start leaving notes on people's Xbox 360s.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
Hey thanks for the ad.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
Appreciate it.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
Comment back please.

04:36.000 --> 04:41.000
Like those god awful like glitter graphics that are like you know.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
How are you doing?

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
Happy Thanksgiving.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
What's up sexy gal.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
Yeah I know.

04:46.000 --> 04:50.000
You're in the what is it the MySpace sexiest person alive award.

04:50.000 --> 04:54.000
Actually copy and paste this to 10 people or else you'll be ugly tomorrow.

04:54.000 --> 05:00.000
You know if you do have the Xbox Live vision camera you can send wonderful like pictures like that.

05:00.000 --> 05:04.000
You know you may have to take a picture of your computer monitor or something like that.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
You know with the image on there but you could you know.

05:07.000 --> 05:11.000
Or girls can just take pictures of their tits and guys can take pictures of their wangs.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
I mean that's.

05:12.000 --> 05:16.000
I approve all pictures of women's tits sent to my account on there.

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
Not all of them.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
You'll redirect the wangs to your wife.

05:21.000 --> 05:25.000
I'm just going to take a picture of someone pooing and be like this is what I think of

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
you.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
Stop posting this crap.

05:27.000 --> 05:32.000
I wonder if anyone's been banned like off of live yet for like inappropriate pictures

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
in their profile.

05:33.000 --> 05:38.000
Irene's going to send pictures of two girls one cup to her full friends list.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
Yes.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
Videos even.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
You could make that your icon you know using the vision camera.

05:43.000 --> 05:48.000
You remember a while back when Microsoft was banning people for 24 hours for questionable

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
bio lines.

05:49.000 --> 05:55.000
I wonder if anybody's tried two girls one cup fan to see if that gets them banned.

05:55.000 --> 06:01.000
I don't see why that would be offensive just putting something like that.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
Because it's not offensive.

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
Like oh my God you said two girls one cup.

06:06.000 --> 06:10.000
We ban you.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
Anyhow.

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
Moving on to other things that will soon be on Xbox Live.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
BioShock.

06:17.000 --> 06:21.000
We've all been waiting for some more content for the game BioShock and a patch is going

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
to be coming out soon.

06:23.000 --> 06:27.000
It's actually going to have downloadable content with the patch.

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
Or actually the patch is going to enable this download content.

06:30.000 --> 06:34.000
I assume isn't the patch supposed to fix the wide screen thing too or is that already been

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
done?

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
No it's going to do that.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
I see so that's the whole thing that this patch is fixing.

06:38.000 --> 06:44.000
The new downloadable content will I assume be a new level or something but they don't

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
really say a lot about what it is.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
New plasmids.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
Oh new plasmids.

06:47.000 --> 06:51.000
New plasmids and there's supposed to be a new difficulty in there that's going to disable

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
the vitachambers.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
Nice.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
So that's pretty cool.

06:56.000 --> 06:59.000
Guitar Hero 3 had a new download pack.

06:59.000 --> 07:07.000
This time in the form of some indie love and included in there three songs from artists

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
you might not be familiar with.

07:09.000 --> 07:14.000
Including you get State of Massachusetts by Dropkick Murphys.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
Pretty good punk band.

07:15.000 --> 07:23.000
You Should Be Ashamed of Myself by The Bled and Memories of the Groove by Maylene and

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
Sons of Disasters.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
Now this is a pack for Guitar Hero 2.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
Oh Guitar Hero 2.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
Right?

07:30.000 --> 07:34.000
I was going to say yeah this is a pack for Guitar Hero 2 and that kind of made me go

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
well that's interesting because now Guitar Hero 3 is out but then you have to kind of

07:37.000 --> 07:42.000
think about well oh yeah Guitar Hero 2 and 3 were kind of made by different companies

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
so.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
Yeah.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
That threw me off.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
Right.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
You're fired Loki.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
Sorry.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
I'll play Guitar Hero 3 right now.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
Alright.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
I'm not listening to Orange on the radio anymore.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
You fired Loki.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
I'm quitting my song.

07:55.000 --> 08:00.000
He fired me for a bad review of download content for Guitar Hero.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
Oh my god.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
Where's one up on my lawn?

08:03.000 --> 08:08.000
I do love this show sometimes.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
Other times it sucks.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
Which is like 99%.

08:12.000 --> 08:17.000
Xbox Live Arcade is going to be getting a classic game.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
Actually I thought we already had this game on Xbox Live.

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
Chess is going to be coming to Xbox Live.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
Isn't that part of the Spyglass?

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
Yeah.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
Chess Master though.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
I know.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
It's Chess Master.

08:27.000 --> 08:31.000
Specifically the Chess Master series which was a huge series on PC from what I remember.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
Like every year there was a new Chess Master game.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
Yeah.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
But all I know is that it isn't Battle Chess.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
So for that, epic fail.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
Or Battleship.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
I want Battleship in life.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
Battleship is kind of hokey.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
Why are you beeping over there?

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
I'm not.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
My new phone is.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
Because someone sunk her Battleship apparently.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
Yeah.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
Chess Master is going to be coming to Xbox Live Arcade.

08:51.000 --> 08:55.000
Hopefully it's a little better and a little polished than the Spyglass thing was.

08:55.000 --> 08:59.000
It's supposed to have lots of different AI opponents of varying difficulty.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
We'll see.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
Camera support as well.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
So we'll see.

09:04.000 --> 09:12.000
And I would say coming to Xbox Live Arcade very soon would be the most ironic name of

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
the game I'd say.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
The sensible world of soccer.

09:15.000 --> 09:19.000
I don't know about you but I don't think the world of soccer is very sensible.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
That's a real game.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
I know.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
That's why I'm laughing.

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
It's like when I think of sensible, I think of soccer.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
I don't know.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
Soccer fans are pretty rowdy sometimes.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
The game actually looked kind of fun.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
I saw a trailer.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
I never played this game.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
As much of a Commodore fan as I was back in the day, I didn't have Amiga.

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
I only ever had a Commodore 64.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
I never really played this game.

09:41.000 --> 09:48.000
Anyway, Sensible World of Soccer is coming to Xbox Live Arcade on December 19th.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
Wow.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
So, hooray.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
Be excited.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
I don't know.

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
You know me, stupid American, don't like soccer.

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
Dark Tetsuya says it looks like a Game Boy Color game.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
It doesn't look like a Game Boy Color game, but it does look like a Super Nintendo game.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
It looks like an older computer system, you know?

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
Hey, yeah.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
It's supposed to look a little older.

10:09.000 --> 10:14.000
Some of the games on Live Arcade look a little crappy because they're old 80s game ports,

10:14.000 --> 10:18.000
but hey, it might play better than Pro Evo 2008.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
Well, yeah, because it's sensible.

10:20.000 --> 10:26.000
Well, also on the Xbox 360, this week it already happened a brand new backwards compatibility update.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
Some folks were thinking that this fell off the face of the earth,

10:29.000 --> 10:34.000
that they were never going to release new updates for backwards compatibility again, but it happened.

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
They added 84 new games to the backwards compatibility list.

10:37.000 --> 10:42.000
There are now 465 games that are backwards compatible.

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
Some of the highlights of games that are now in there,

10:45.000 --> 10:52.000
Blitz the League, Blood Omen 2, Burnout 2, Point of Impact,

10:52.000 --> 10:57.000
Fight Night Round 3, Forgotten Realms Demon Stone,

10:57.000 --> 11:01.000
Freedom Fighters, a lot of sports games like MVP Baseball,

11:01.000 --> 11:07.000
03, 04, 05, NCAA March Madness, 05, 06,

11:07.000 --> 11:15.000
a lot of NHL games, 2K3, 05, 2K3 is on there twice, I think they cheated.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
NHL 2K3.

11:17.000 --> 11:20.000
Oh, there's NFL and NHL, my bad, one letter off.

11:20.000 --> 11:23.000
Playboy the Mansion, I'm sure a lot of folks are looking forward to that.

11:23.000 --> 11:27.000
Here's the one game on the entire list that I actually own for whatever reason,

11:27.000 --> 11:32.000
Tecmo Classic Arcade is now backwards compatible as well.

11:32.000 --> 11:36.000
I know Loki owns this game, this is worth noting, The Guy Game.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
I don't own it on Xbox, though.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
Oh, really?

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
I don't technically own it either.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
I thought you bought it on PlayStation 2 or something.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
Yeah, bought it.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
Yeah, all right.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
Quote, end quote.

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
Worms 3D, I don't know if you're a fan of the Worms series, Loki.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
Worms is fun.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
There you have it.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
Not the 3D Worms.

11:52.000 --> 11:56.000
Not playable still, games such as Advent Rising,

11:56.000 --> 12:00.000
Dance Dance Revolution series still not playable, backwards compatible.

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
Wow, I should be clamoring to get an Xbox 360.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
Beyond Good and Evil, I think.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
All right.

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
Anyways.

12:09.000 --> 12:12.000
One interesting thing, the Xbox Live Video Marketplace

12:12.000 --> 12:16.000
is going to be coming to Europe pretty soon.

12:16.000 --> 12:20.000
And this is actually coming from one of those prepaid cards.

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
Apparently, written on the back in very small print,

12:23.000 --> 12:28.000
said you can access the Xbox Live Video Marketplace

12:28.000 --> 12:32.000
available in the UK, Ireland, France, and Germany.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
So apparently this hasn't happened soon,

12:34.000 --> 12:38.000
the cards now being already printed have that information on there.

12:38.000 --> 12:41.000
So soon you will be able to watch videos

12:41.000 --> 12:45.000
and enjoy all the rest of the download content

12:45.000 --> 12:49.000
that we have around the world.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
Be excited.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
I'm not.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
I don't know if you saw this hit the internet earlier this week,

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
but there was a video that went out on the internet

12:59.000 --> 13:03.000
that it was kind of a social experiment, I guess you could call it,

13:03.000 --> 13:07.000
a guy whose nickname was X Gay Boy X

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
signed on to Halo 3.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
Triple X Gay Boy X.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
Sorry about that.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
He signed on to Halo 3

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
and basically got all these people to say really,

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
I mean, I shouldn't say he,

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
because that makes it sound like he provoked it,

13:21.000 --> 13:26.000
but people would respond to his name and taunt him.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
I'd love to see it.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
Irene wants to see a little clip of this.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
I don't know if legally we can play the whole thing.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
Yeah, we should.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
That's long.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
I don't want to play the whole thing.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
Yeah, don't play the whole thing.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
I just want to see interesting things.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
We'll play some clips.

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
We'll play some clips for Rice Princess.

13:40.000 --> 13:45.000
Have your dad give you bloody butt again, faggot.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
Yeah, fuck you, Gay Boy, you piece of shit.

13:47.000 --> 13:50.000
Gay Boy, quit sucking off dudes and play.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
Gay Boy.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
Gay Boy.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
Gay Boy.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
Fucking Gay Boy.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
Hey, what's up, Gay Boy?

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
We should hook up.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
I'm Friendly Uncle.

13:57.000 --> 14:00.000
Gay Boy and Friendly Uncle coming at you.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
Something that should be noted,

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
because you notice that isn't so bad.

14:03.000 --> 14:08.000
There are a few things in here that are not necessarily negative, for instance,

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
but who knows if it's somebody.

14:10.000 --> 14:16.000
You know how sometimes jocks in high school would befriend the nerds on a dare type thing?

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
Yeah.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
You don't know.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
Maybe it's something like that, but I doubt it.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
It seems pretty genuine.

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
One, two, punch.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
Hope gay marriage never gets passed.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
Have fun being single.

14:25.000 --> 14:30.000
Well, we'll make it to a single boy.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
Shut the fuck up.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
You're still a faggot.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
Well, it doesn't matter, dude.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
I'm sorry.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
You're not a faggot.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
You give a bad name to gays.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
You're a fucking nuke.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
You're a niggit.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.000
Don't worry, guys.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
Ah, there you go.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
That's enough.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
Wow.

14:46.000 --> 14:49.000
If I hadn't already heard all this stuff before in games,

14:49.000 --> 14:53.000
I'd probably be a little more shocked, but that's still very perturbing.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
It's really like, I don't know.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
Well, I don't know.

14:57.000 --> 15:00.000
You'd think I'd have a strong opinion on this because I am the gay host here

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
on Orange Launch Radio.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
Yeah, that's just Halo for you.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
Whatever, gay boy.

15:05.000 --> 15:11.000
I watched this clip, and I was just tapping my fingers.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
And don't get me wrong.

15:12.000 --> 15:16.000
This is incredibly fucked up, but in my mind, it's kind of like,

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
it's not news.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
This is why Xbox Live is infamous.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
Hello and welcome to the internet.

15:21.000 --> 15:24.000
Where have you been for years?

15:24.000 --> 15:27.000
I mean, in a way, I'm a little bit torn because yes,

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
I think these people are really fucked up, and yes,

15:29.000 --> 15:32.000
I think it's fucking sad that there's ignorant people like that out there,

15:32.000 --> 15:36.000
but at the same time, it's a little bit entrapment or provoking it

15:36.000 --> 15:40.000
when the guy goes on there with a name like, you know, gay boy.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
But I don't see it that way.

15:42.000 --> 15:46.000
Why does it have to be seen as entrapment if you have a name like gay boy?

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
I'm a hetero boy.

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
I would be interested to see what hetero boy would...

15:50.000 --> 15:53.000
Yeah, like, that's dumb.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
I don't know.

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
Like, on the one hand, I'm infuriated.

15:57.000 --> 16:00.000
I'm kind of like livid that people would say that kind of stuff.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
Or I heart Jesus or something like that.

16:02.000 --> 16:06.000
Yeah, but at the same time, it's just kind of like, well, you know,

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
successful.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
It was funny, though.

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
This is why I only like to play with friends and OLR listeners.

16:11.000 --> 16:15.000
I want to say like Fox News or somebody ran some sort of report on this

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
and they were talking about like...

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
I saw that about the trash talk.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
Yeah, there's some other YouTube out there.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
Yeah, Fox just did a report this week.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
I saw that.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
And the whole thing was like they're all, you know,

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
are you guys surprised that this is on there?

16:26.000 --> 16:27.000
And they're like, no.

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
And then like I remember reading some comments on that and they're like,

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
yeah, of course they're not surprised.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
They're the ones fucking saying that shit.

16:33.000 --> 16:37.000
They're going to be like 12-year-olds and stuff, 13-year-olds.

16:37.000 --> 16:40.000
Now, the reason why I want to bring this up is that, you know,

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
obviously these things make their way around the Internet.

16:42.000 --> 16:48.000
And if anybody, Microsoft, has proven they're very good about kind of

16:48.000 --> 16:52.000
staying on top of the Internet buzz and trying to plomp this mob mentality

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
when they see it.

16:53.000 --> 16:56.000
And, you know, one of their representatives, Trixie,

16:56.000 --> 16:59.000
was actually posting on the GayGamer.net blog post where this showed up

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
and just trying to kind of, you know, say,

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
hey, I think these guys are assholes too.

17:03.000 --> 17:07.000
And when you see this happen, report it because we do follow up on that shit.

17:07.000 --> 17:10.000
And Major Nelson basically kind of says the same thing.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
Major Nelson posts about it in his blog and says,

17:12.000 --> 17:15.000
I just watched or listened to the video you posted on your site.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
This is what he wrote back to GayGamer.net who posted the original thing.

17:17.000 --> 17:21.000
Needless to say, it was disappointing to see how some Xbox Live members behaved.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
As you know, that's not the type of behavior we support.

17:23.000 --> 17:27.000
With over 8 million members, it's unfortunate that some members decide to act like this.

17:27.000 --> 17:30.000
I want to point out a few things that all Xbox Live members can do

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
to ensure an enjoyable experience.

17:32.000 --> 17:35.000
And reiterates, you know, you can turn off voice from people that aren't your friends,

17:35.000 --> 17:38.000
only play with friends, file complaints.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
And he reiterates, we do act on complaints,

17:40.000 --> 17:43.000
so I highly encourage people to file complaints where appropriate.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
And you know what? I do that.

17:45.000 --> 17:49.000
When I play on Xbox Live, if somebody is being annoying,

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
because some people will get, I swear to God,

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
you'll get on Halo 3 and you'll get into some matches

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
and somebody will be doing this the whole time.

18:05.000 --> 18:11.000
I swear to God, for the entire match, somebody did that to me once.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
That's kind of funny.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
Then if I ever met that person in real life, I'd punch him.

18:15.000 --> 18:20.000
I muted the little fucker, finally, so he was just sitting there by himself.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
Maybe he had a mental problem.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
That's what I was going to say.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
Maybe he had a headache.

18:25.000 --> 18:30.000
I don't think the mental problem was that severe because he was kicking my ass in Halo.

18:30.000 --> 18:33.000
Maybe he's like Rain Man or something.

18:33.000 --> 18:38.000
He's really good at Halo, but he just says meh meh meh meh a lot.

18:38.000 --> 18:42.000
That could be his thing, but yeah.

18:42.000 --> 18:46.000
I muted him and then I rated the fucker down.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
You go into the little thing and you can rate.

18:48.000 --> 18:52.000
You know how everybody on Xbox Live has a five-star rating?

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
Not if you play with me in Halo 3.

18:54.000 --> 18:58.000
I'll rate you down so fast if you get on there and say something nasty.

18:58.000 --> 19:03.000
I had somebody get on there going n-word, n-word, n-word over and over

19:03.000 --> 19:06.000
and I reported it as abuse.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
That's just disgusting.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
It's gross.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
Why do you have to say that?

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
It's because Mommy and Daddy aren't looking and they're acting out

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
to make themselves feel better about themselves.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
It's because Mommy and Daddy bought them an M-rated game

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
and obviously aren't paying attention to what they're doing

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
and they'll pay for their damn live account

19:21.000 --> 19:24.000
because it gives Mommy and Daddy a few moments to breathe

19:24.000 --> 19:27.000
and make more babies.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
Frisbee brings up a good point.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
Is he a cat?

19:31.000 --> 19:35.000
Oh God, I hope I wasn't getting my ass kicked by a cat.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
Laser cat.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
That would be kind of sad.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
I think I'd have to quit video gaming forever.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
Man, that must be a stupid cat.

19:40.000 --> 19:43.000
Meow, meow, meow, meow.

19:43.000 --> 19:44.000
You can't even meow right.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
Shut up, cat.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
I'm muting you.

19:47.000 --> 19:50.000
Hey, my cat couldn't meow right for a while.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.000
It took her time to figure out.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
I know.

19:52.000 --> 19:53.000
I really had to restrain myself from meowing.

19:53.000 --> 19:56.000
Stupid faggot cat, stop meowing so fucking much.

19:56.000 --> 19:59.000
N-word, n-word cat, geez.

19:59.000 --> 20:04.000
Black cat, what's that, huh?

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
That's terrible.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
Sephiroth1215 says something else really good.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
Listen to these people, though.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
They're not really 12 and 13.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
These people are usually in their 20s.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
Yeah, those people did sound a little bit older,

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
but they sounded like pigs, too.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
They sounded like frat boys in a dorm room.

20:18.000 --> 20:21.000
Gay boy.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.000
Look at this.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
I just totally told this guy.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
Man, I'm awesome.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
Dorm rules.

20:27.000 --> 20:30.000
See, and they all have lame nicknames, too.

20:30.000 --> 20:33.000
It's usually like, oh, halo lover and stuff like that,

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
or like, I love unicorns or something.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
Like, how could you make fun of a name, gay boy?

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
Master Chief is my butt buddy.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.000
Exactly.

20:40.000 --> 20:43.000
And he really is.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
They're stupid.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
They can't think of anything more creative,

20:46.000 --> 20:50.000
like a more creative way to make fun of someone,

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
instead of gay boy.

20:51.000 --> 20:55.000
Oh, you're gay, and you're a boy.

20:55.000 --> 20:56.000
It's stupid.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
But the parts of it that are really singing to me

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
is that people will suddenly jump on there,

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
and then they'll be like, I hope gay marriage is banned forever

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
and you're single forever.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.000
It's like, dude.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
Like, wow.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
It's just some guy on the internet playing Halo.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
Oh, that hurt my ego.

21:09.000 --> 21:13.000
I can't fight back in Halo now.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
Oh, man.

21:15.000 --> 21:18.000
What am I to do?

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
But then Nintendo looks at this shit and goes,

21:20.000 --> 21:23.000
that's why we've got friend codes.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
Oh, Nintendo's so smart.

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
I don't know about that.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
Anyhow.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
Kicking you, kicking you.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
So even more ridiculous news here.

21:30.000 --> 21:33.000
Apparently, there is a guy filing a class action lawsuit

21:33.000 --> 21:38.000
because he believes that Microsoft created defective copies

21:38.000 --> 21:45.000
of Halo 3 that are causing Xbox 360s to blow up everywhere.

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
No, that wasn't Microsoft.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
That was me.

21:47.000 --> 21:50.000
Anyways, apparently, this guy out of San Diego,

21:50.000 --> 21:57.000
Randy Nunez, is going ahead with a lawsuit against them.

21:57.000 --> 22:00.000
Apparently, he purchased a copy of Halo 3 from GameStop

22:00.000 --> 22:05.000
and was plagued by system lockups and freezes and crashes

22:05.000 --> 22:06.000
when he tried to play it.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
Well, where's the explosions?

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
When you say that the...

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
I was being sarcastic.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.000
Blow up the 360.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
I'm thinking I played Halo.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.000
Sarcasm.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
Close it and then suddenly tick, tick, tick.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
Boom.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
Sarcasm.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
Rad.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
I'll be actually kind of rad.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.000
I'd buy another one.

22:21.000 --> 22:22.000
No, he...

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
I would not.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
Did he try a different copy of the game,

22:25.000 --> 22:29.000
return a defective one to GameStop for replacement?

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
That, the story doesn't say.

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
You know he was using a 360.

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
So, but here's the thing, though.

22:35.000 --> 22:38.000
But, I mean, this is a bunch of bullshit anyways

22:38.000 --> 22:41.000
because I remember this story came out, like, you know,

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
before that, oh, maybe Halo's breaking systems.

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
No, it actually is because you're playing the game

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
so much that your system's overheating

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
if you happen to have that overheating problem

22:49.000 --> 22:53.000
and then you get three rings of death or whatever.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
It's stupid.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
And the fact that this guy's going to sue for this shit,

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
I hope he fails.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
But, you know, unfortunately nowadays

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
a lot of times these people succeed, so.

23:01.000 --> 23:04.000
And, of course, whenever we hear about the frivolous lawsuits

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
we get a little bit angsty.

23:05.000 --> 23:09.000
And nothing inspires our next segment like frivolous lawsuits.

23:09.000 --> 23:12.000
It's time to bring on the FUs of the week.

23:12.000 --> 23:27.000
Music

23:27.000 --> 23:30.000
Hey, I guess I would say this is a pre-FU

23:30.000 --> 23:33.000
for my work review that's going to be this week

23:33.000 --> 23:37.000
which I'm demanding a raise, which I'm sure I will not get.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
But I haven't gotten one in three years

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
and I'm well deserving of one

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
since I have four times the accounts

23:43.000 --> 23:47.000
that certain other sales reps do at my company.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
So basically my whole thing is I'm going to go in there

23:49.000 --> 23:52.000
and just say, okay, am I getting a review or not?

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
And if I'm not, then I'm going to be a complete asshole.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
You should.

23:55.000 --> 23:59.000
So fuck you stupid managers at my work

23:59.000 --> 24:02.000
that aren't willing to pay me a decent salary.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
I'm already underpaid as it is.

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
If I get a fucking raise,

24:05.000 --> 24:10.000
then I'll be just slightly less underpaid.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
I'll go next.

24:11.000 --> 24:14.000
My FU of the week goes to the fact that I don't own a house.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
I rent, but I don't own

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
because I went to a party last night with William.

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
These guys own this house.

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
It was just beautiful what they've done with it.

24:21.000 --> 24:25.000
The backyard was all like an island getaway.

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
I mean, seriously,

24:26.000 --> 24:29.000
they had spent obviously a lot of time remodeling this place.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
I'm just like, I want a house that's cool.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
Don't get me wrong.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
I love this house, but I can't really change it

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
because it's not mine.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
Does that make sense?

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
So FU to not owning a house.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
I'll be rich one day, damn it.

24:39.000 --> 24:40.000
One of these days.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
Yeah, that's right.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
Rice Princess, do you have anything?

24:43.000 --> 24:48.000
FU to cats that can't meow properly.

24:48.000 --> 24:51.000
They need to make a speech.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
Shut up, cat.

24:53.000 --> 24:56.000
Yeah, that's it.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
All right.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
That does it for the FUs of the week.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.000
That was really short.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
Wow.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
Usually there's a lot of angst built up for this.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
It's because we stopped reading chat FUs.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
They say we got a lot shorter.

25:08.000 --> 25:12.000
Wow, that lasted like a minute and a half.

25:12.000 --> 25:17.000
Black Lab's in chat and says, an internet radio will not be getting you a house, Rob.

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
Truer words have not been spoken.

25:19.000 --> 25:20.000
Wait a minute, what?

25:20.000 --> 25:21.000
What?

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
Non-believer?

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
What?

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
Where's that?

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
Is that a chat name or something?

25:26.000 --> 25:30.000
No, an internet radio will not be getting you a house, Rob.

25:30.000 --> 25:33.000
So you think you don't know.

25:33.000 --> 25:34.000
Rob, what?

25:34.000 --> 25:35.000
Geez.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.000
I have to-

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
No, Eidos is building me a house because I'm-

25:37.000 --> 25:41.000
I have to divert our attention real quick because there's the last minute story.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
And I need you to pull this up.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
Gamersreports.com.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
This better be good.

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
Has a brand new trailer.

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
For?

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
For Africa.

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
Gamersreports.com?

25:55.000 --> 25:58.000
Yeah, Gamers, with an S, reports.com.

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
Aha.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
Oh.

26:00.000 --> 26:01.000
New Africa.

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
A New Africa trailer for the PS3.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.000
I think we should watch.

26:04.000 --> 26:05.000
Is this real or is this something to be-

26:05.000 --> 26:06.000
No, it's real.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
And it has a song.

26:08.000 --> 26:26.000
I want to know what is worthy about interrupting the show with this.

26:26.000 --> 26:31.000
Do we get to find out what the hell you do in this game?

26:31.000 --> 26:32.000
I don't know.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
I didn't watch the whole trailer.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
Oh.

26:36.000 --> 26:40.220
I don't have a

26:40.220 --> 26:58.000
I don't have a

26:58.000 --> 27:01.920

okay can i fast forward a little bit you're gonna hopefully see if we get to

27:05.440 --> 27:08.720

27:19.280 --> 27:24.400
this is the most boring game ever whoopty-doo oh hey oh the hippo is

28:28.480 --> 28:31.840
interesting yeah yeah well stay tuned for more

28:31.840 --> 28:36.240
information about yeah right in in six months

28:36.240 --> 28:41.840
whoopty-doo all right i'm waiting an eager and your solid five

28:41.840 --> 28:45.440
let's move on to the gaming news shall we and uh you know here on

28:45.440 --> 28:48.960
orange entre do we like to talk about the current systems and everything the

28:48.960 --> 28:53.280
kids are playing so that's why this next article is about the commodore 64 whoa

28:53.280 --> 28:59.520
radical and uh yes on the commodore 64 somebody with a lot of free time has

28:59.520 --> 29:04.240
managed to make a guitar hero clone type thing for the commodore 64

29:04.240 --> 29:08.000
now i shouldn't say it's a full game yet it's still in its concept stages but

29:08.000 --> 29:11.920
it's called shreds 64 and what they did is they took

29:11.920 --> 29:15.280
their playstation 2 guitar and basically adapted it so that it can

29:15.280 --> 29:19.200
be read in the uh joystick ports and uh yeah now they've made it so that

29:19.200 --> 29:22.640
you know the notes fall and it reads the guitar and they have

29:22.640 --> 29:26.400
what's called the shredocity and the applause and the applause is

29:26.400 --> 29:29.840
basically the uh meter you know um how well you're doing just like in

29:29.840 --> 29:34.400
the game and i guess shredocity is uh kind of like your you know when you tilt

29:34.400 --> 29:37.360
up your uh crowd crowd meter or whatever

29:37.360 --> 29:41.760
crowd boost stuff so shredos yes your shredocity that is

29:41.760 --> 29:46.400
so rad i like that a lot so somebody yeah you're a commodore 64 fangirl aren't

29:46.400 --> 29:48.640
you i kind of am yeah it started off with this

29:48.640 --> 29:50.640
little tech demo where somebody did this and

29:50.640 --> 29:54.560
the it was able to recognize the controller strum up strum down

29:54.560 --> 29:58.720
lifting up all that stuff kind of neat loki i'm surprised you're not into this

29:58.720 --> 30:01.520
kind of stuff then again it is commodore 64 i know that's not your thing

30:01.520 --> 30:05.520
that's commodore 64 ain't my thing still kind of cool

30:05.520 --> 30:09.360
i like it i approve of this project me too thumbs up

30:09.360 --> 30:13.120
anyway i'm disappointed to see that we don't have a dreamcast game yet

30:13.120 --> 30:16.320
of like you know guitar hero or something like that

30:16.320 --> 30:20.080
because you know the dreamcast has tons of games coming out for some reason even

30:20.080 --> 30:24.480
though you know sure enough uh anyways um

30:24.480 --> 30:27.600
another mod also kind of dealing with a music game

30:27.600 --> 30:30.640
um rock band as you remember me complaining about

30:30.640 --> 30:35.040
the drums and how loud they were apparently a lot of people are looking

30:35.040 --> 30:38.880
for homebrew ways of making them quieter and there's a couple

30:38.880 --> 30:40.480
different methods that you can use out there

30:40.480 --> 30:44.000
uh one of which is self self-adhesive rubber

30:44.000 --> 30:50.000
and self-adhesive colored felt and you basically shove that on there and it

30:50.000 --> 30:54.160
doesn't have to be colored felt just so that you know you know which

30:54.160 --> 30:56.080
color because if you're covering the whole drum

30:56.080 --> 31:00.000
you're not going to know what color is what you don't have to you can do all

31:00.000 --> 31:05.360
black if you're emo like that i mean so whatever but um there's another

31:05.360 --> 31:09.680
one i saw also there was a rubber mouse pad

31:09.680 --> 31:14.320
and you glue that on there so apparently though it works pretty well

31:14.320 --> 31:17.920
and um reducing the sound i guess by um

31:17.920 --> 31:23.360
70 well there you go maybe the wife will let you play if you can reduce the sound

31:23.360 --> 31:27.200
she oh by the way um she bought rock band for me

31:27.200 --> 31:31.280
or she gave me a check for because i paid with it my money but she only

31:31.280 --> 31:34.560
she only paid for 100 of it because she says that the remainder of the money

31:34.560 --> 31:38.400
would have been for the drum kit and she's not supporting the drum kit

31:38.400 --> 31:43.280
that's awesome your wife is hilarious

31:43.520 --> 31:46.160
tell her we need i'm gonna take her out we're gonna go to olive garden have a

31:46.160 --> 31:50.400
fancy dinner all right happy olive garden i'll take

31:50.400 --> 31:54.800
it a red lobster if she wants spare no expense all right

31:54.800 --> 31:57.920
well uh if you've been following the entertainment world at all which i'm

31:57.920 --> 32:01.040
sure many of you folks that play video games also enjoy the occasional movie or

32:01.040 --> 32:03.120
tv show and i'm sure you are aware of the

32:03.120 --> 32:05.440
current writers guild strike that's going on

32:05.440 --> 32:08.960
uh which is you know gonna kind of end some of your favorite shows a little

32:08.960 --> 32:13.840
early this year like heroes next week's battle star galactica is that

32:13.840 --> 32:16.720
is that something like some no something's getting postponed it might

32:16.720 --> 32:20.560
even be all together cancelled what because of this damn strike they can't

32:20.560 --> 32:28.320
they can't cancel battle star they can be sure shit can be honest with heroes

32:28.320 --> 32:30.800
man i think that's actually kind of good for

32:30.800 --> 32:34.160
them no i i think heroes has been just fine this season

32:34.160 --> 32:37.360
there's it's it was slow to develop like the first season

32:37.360 --> 32:41.760
but the past few episodes have been amazing it's all right and l is awesome

32:41.760 --> 32:45.040
i swear to god if they kill her off monday i'm gonna be so pissed anyway

32:45.040 --> 32:50.320
um well obviously the right what i said two of them are supposed to die

32:50.320 --> 32:54.240
yeah don't remind me all right and l probably no

32:54.240 --> 32:59.200
writer's strike uh is going on well one thing that they are not striking against

32:59.200 --> 33:04.960
is video games and uh the writer's guild is allowed to write for video games

33:04.960 --> 33:10.240
currently while the strike is going on so um something to think about they are

33:10.240 --> 33:12.560
allowing the members to work on games during the strike that's

33:12.560 --> 33:15.840
that could be a good thing because honestly some of these games could use a

33:15.840 --> 33:19.680
few better writers so i say uh this is a good thing for the

33:19.680 --> 33:23.920
video game industry bad for tv movies good for video games

33:23.920 --> 33:30.320
so anyways um another good thing that's good for video

33:30.320 --> 33:33.520
games is using topless models to promote them

33:33.520 --> 33:37.760
and that's what ea did for their european ad campaign

33:37.760 --> 33:41.360
where they use two sexy models that were naked to

33:41.360 --> 33:47.840
you know promote the game i approve okay did you guys see the new we commercial

33:47.840 --> 33:51.760
for what game was it where they're kind of

33:51.760 --> 33:56.640
like sort of parodying um fast times at richmont high where the

33:56.640 --> 34:01.040
girls coming out of the um pool and they're like in bikinis and

34:01.040 --> 34:03.440
what game was it promoting i don't know but like

34:03.440 --> 34:09.680
nintendo's using sex to sell like what's going on here wholesome nintendo

34:09.680 --> 34:13.280
putting girls in bikinis maybe they finally figured out that sex sells i

34:13.280 --> 34:15.920
don't know girls in bikinis i don't yeah they're

34:15.920 --> 34:20.400
like two girls i don't remember what game it was it was a competitive game

34:20.400 --> 34:23.760

34:39.280 --> 34:42.880
is saying smackdown versus raw 08 oh maybe that's what it was yeah and they

34:42.880 --> 34:46.160
say it's the publisher not nintendo yeah that would be a third party publisher

34:46.160 --> 34:52.560
okay yeah that's like mario galaxy now with more nipples

34:52.560 --> 34:57.520

34:57.520 --> 35:01.440
anything else you have to go around and collect 100 boobies

35:01.440 --> 35:05.440
that's what people do in those 8-bit hacks like you know when they hack the

35:05.440 --> 35:07.840
old games they'll turn everything into porn

35:07.840 --> 35:11.520

36:39.840 --> 36:44.400

36:48.480 --> 36:51.520

yeah all right boring anyhow if i wanted flat boobies i'd go to africa

37:09.760 --> 37:12.960
i forgot what i don't know because every time they

37:12.960 --> 37:15.840
show the national geographic ladies with their boobies

37:15.840 --> 37:20.560
they're like flat and not always i've seen some big boobies

37:20.560 --> 37:24.560
i'm seeing that i know i'm like this conversation is not going to a happy

37:24.560 --> 37:30.400
place it's true so let's talk about uh toys

37:30.400 --> 37:34.960
and children's toys okay and uh that you know what like all these toys have been

37:34.960 --> 37:37.360
getting recalled this year like the uh what was the

37:37.360 --> 37:40.560
oh god what was that the dots thing that had a

37:40.560 --> 37:44.720
date rape drug in it apparently oh no no it was something you could use as an

37:44.720 --> 37:48.000
ingredient in creating the date rape drug if you eat it

37:48.000 --> 37:51.200
oh that's right yeah the same effect what was that called the dots or

37:51.200 --> 37:54.000
whatever we need a bunch of that the hell was

37:54.000 --> 37:56.400
why you just want to eat it i don't want to eat it

37:56.400 --> 38:00.320
i want to make dot creations you want to make the cat eat it and see what happens

38:00.320 --> 38:04.000
oh no i wouldn't i wouldn't make sure kitty eat that that's mean

38:04.000 --> 38:07.000
That would go, mama mama.

38:07.000 --> 38:08.000
Yeah.

38:08.000 --> 38:09.000
Awkward kitty.

38:09.000 --> 38:10.000
Awkward dots.

38:10.000 --> 38:11.000
Thank you, Raven's Dolphin.

38:11.000 --> 38:12.000
Awkward dots.

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
That's what they were called.

38:14.000 --> 38:19.000
Well, anyhow, according to a recent article in the Los Angeles Time, apparently because

38:19.000 --> 38:25.000
of all these recalls, apparently game publishers are seeing a 19% increase in sales because

38:25.000 --> 38:31.000
I guess games are safe and they're not going to try to drug your children as you are aware.

38:31.000 --> 38:35.000
They'll just show them pictures of murder and everything like that, you know?

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
Pictures of murder, yes.

38:37.000 --> 38:38.000
Like, murder.

38:38.000 --> 38:41.000
You remember Manhunt 2 is murder.

38:41.000 --> 38:42.000
Murder Sims.

38:42.000 --> 38:47.000
Anyhow, listen, we don't need to give Manhunt 2 any more press.

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
I mean, the game's not that good.

38:49.000 --> 38:56.000
Anyway, this is coming from a quote from Jarek Johnson, who's an analyst from Capital Markets,

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
says, there's definitely money leaving the toy sector.

38:58.000 --> 39:03.000
It's logical to assume that video games might be viewed by some parents as an alternative.

39:03.000 --> 39:07.000
He's an analyst.

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
Why you gotta take this show to the Toilet Rice Princess?

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
I don't know.

39:11.000 --> 39:12.000
Anyhow, anyways.

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
Just an impulse.

39:14.000 --> 39:15.000
Yeah.

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
This picture's naughty.

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
Anyways, sorry.

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
What are you doing over there on your laptop?

39:21.000 --> 39:24.000
You don't have to announce it on the show.

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
Yeah, this picture's naughty.

39:26.000 --> 39:29.000
Oh yeah, that's real butter.

39:29.000 --> 39:33.000
No, anyways, completely off topic here.

39:33.000 --> 39:39.000
Space Invaders Extreme is being released for the Nintendo DS in Japan.

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
And why should I even mention this?

39:41.000 --> 39:44.000
Because, you know, hey, it's Space Invaders and it's a remake.

39:44.000 --> 39:45.000
It actually looks pretty cool.

39:45.000 --> 39:51.000
It kind of incorporates music a little bit to it, and they have a YouTube video on Joystick right now.

39:51.000 --> 39:52.000
Worth checking out.

39:52.000 --> 40:00.000
And it reminds me a lot of Rez or even, like, Luminous a little bit.

40:00.000 --> 40:01.000
Really?

40:01.000 --> 40:04.000
Yeah, it's really cool looking, actually.

40:04.000 --> 40:08.000
So, you know, if it comes out over here, I'm definitely going to have to check it out.

40:08.000 --> 40:11.000
But, you know, it kind of changes a little bit of the pacing of the game and stuff.

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
They have power-ups and stuff you can get.

40:13.000 --> 40:17.000
But, you know, each ship that you blow up kind of, you know, adds beats to the music and stuff.

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
So it's pretty cool.

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
It's got a little, like, trippy background and stuff, too.

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
Is it based on, also, the BPM?

40:23.000 --> 40:27.000
Kind of like how they did on Vibrib and, like, the speed of the stuff coming towards you?

40:27.000 --> 40:30.000
Um, I don't know about that, but it just looks really cool, though.

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
That would be cool.

40:32.000 --> 40:33.000
Mm-hmm.

40:33.000 --> 40:34.000
Yeah.

40:34.000 --> 40:35.000
Yep.

40:35.000 --> 40:36.000
All right.

40:36.000 --> 40:40.000
Well, let's go ahead and move on to our mailbag segment.

40:40.000 --> 40:41.000
That's right.

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
Every week you guys send us emails at mailbag at orangehontrader.com.

40:43.000 --> 40:46.000
We're going to open up the mailbag and choose a few of our favorites.

40:46.000 --> 40:50.000
Since Dark Sakura is not here this week, I will be doing the honors, whether you like it or not.

40:50.000 --> 40:53.000
I am, too.

40:53.000 --> 40:56.000
Too bad.

40:56.000 --> 41:01.000
Email number one this week comes to us from...

41:01.000 --> 41:02.000
I don't know.

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
They didn't sign it.

41:04.000 --> 41:09.000
We're going to say this is from Richard M.

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
He says, all right, I'm listening right now.

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
Apparently, this person's listening to the show right now.

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
I'm playing Halo 3 and blah, blah, blah.

41:15.000 --> 41:18.000
I just wanted to say hi because I haven't listened for about four weeks.

41:18.000 --> 41:23.000
I just got an Xbox 360 and Xbox Live, and I sent a request to you two, Sky and Loki and Dark Sakura.

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
Who's not there right now, but let her know.

41:25.000 --> 41:28.000
Will do, but I'm sure she'll see the friend's request when she logs in next.

41:28.000 --> 41:31.000
I'm still adding most of the other OLR members, but most are pending right now.

41:31.000 --> 41:35.000
But I would like to know which good games I should get.

41:35.000 --> 41:39.000
I mean, I only have Fear, Condemned, Halo 3, and Guitar Hero 2.

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
Give me at least three games you guys think would be great.

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
I'll play anything but sports games.

41:43.000 --> 41:44.000
Okay, that wraps it up.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
Until later, guys, see ya.

41:46.000 --> 41:49.000
Two thumbs up for you guys.

41:49.000 --> 41:50.000
Three games.

41:50.000 --> 41:55.000
Well, if you like Guitar Hero 2, you probably should get Guitar Hero 3.

41:55.000 --> 41:59.000
If you like RPGs, get either Eternal Sonata or maybe Blue Dragon.

41:59.000 --> 42:02.000
I don't know, try the demo first because that's getting some extra views.

42:02.000 --> 42:07.000
I don't know, it's kind of a hit or miss thing.

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
Let's see.

42:09.000 --> 42:13.000
I don't know how into shooters you are, but BioShock's pretty awesome.

42:13.000 --> 42:14.000
If you want to try a shooter, BioShock.

42:14.000 --> 42:18.000
Yeah, if you're playing Halo 3, I said get BioShock.

42:18.000 --> 42:22.000
And if you're looking for cheap shit, I would say Earth Defense Force 2017.

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
It's 1999 now.

42:24.000 --> 42:28.000
Seriously, you deserve to play that game.

42:28.000 --> 42:35.000
I mean, I understand it's really cheesy and stupid, but it draws me in, and I don't know why.

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
Anything else?

42:37.000 --> 42:45.000
I would say also, well, these are a bit older, but even Saints Row's not bad, or Crackdown.

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
Crackdown I liked.

42:47.000 --> 42:48.000
All right.

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
Next email, shall we?

42:50.000 --> 42:53.000
This is from Tensei Noob, emails us.

42:53.000 --> 42:56.000
Dear OLR crew, I have a few comments and one request.

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
First of all, the necessary praise.

42:58.000 --> 43:04.000
I continue to admire your devotion to the show and quite impressed that you managed to release such a funny, informative podcast each week.

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
This podcast is funny.

43:06.000 --> 43:07.000
And informative.

43:07.000 --> 43:15.000
You know, I always worry each week that I'm just kind of being, you know, kind of breezing over stories and just being too much of an ass and just like talking randomness.

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
I don't even know what I'm saying half the time.

43:17.000 --> 43:18.000
I know.

43:18.000 --> 43:21.000
I don't know how much quality I put into this.

43:21.000 --> 43:25.000
We start to feel we're slipping a little bit, so thank you for your kind words.

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
It helps our egos.

43:27.000 --> 43:28.000
Untrue words.

43:28.000 --> 43:31.000
Now that that's out of the way, a while ago you were talking about zombie games.

43:31.000 --> 43:35.000
Not that you don't frequently anyway, but ironic considering our Game of the Week.

43:35.000 --> 43:38.000
But this is an especially concentrated instance.

43:38.000 --> 43:42.000
And you were discussing how it would be great to have a game where you are the zombie.

43:42.000 --> 43:45.000
Have you ever heard of the game Stubbs the Zombie, Rebel Without a Pulse?

43:45.000 --> 43:48.000
Yes, unfortunately I haven't. It's a really crappy game.

43:48.000 --> 43:52.000
I tried a demo of it once and it wasn't revolutionary, but it wasn't horrible either.

43:52.000 --> 43:56.000
You control a zombie who can eat brains, turning the victims into zombie minions.

43:56.000 --> 44:00.000
Take off his hand and take control of others and produce toxic farts.

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
Oh, this game sounds classy.

44:02.000 --> 44:07.000
Anyway, I thought you might appreciate knowing about a game where you actually get to be a zombie instead of always shooting them.

44:07.000 --> 44:10.000
But you weren't a big fan of that, Loki?

44:10.000 --> 44:14.000
It just got horrible reviews. It was a bad game.

44:14.000 --> 44:17.000
It had a funny premise to it, but...

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
Alright.

44:19.000 --> 44:25.000
Secondly, again referring a number of episodes back, I would like to state that Halo 3's story does make sense.

44:25.000 --> 44:30.000
But you really need to have played the previous games and maybe even have read the books to fully comprehend it.

44:30.000 --> 44:36.000
If you need any clarification, I am perfectly willing to help clear up any confusion, as I am yet another devoted Halo fan.

44:36.000 --> 44:44.000
On a related note, I completed Halo 3 first time through on Legendary in three days, so I can also provide any gameplay advice you may require, especially for later levels.

44:44.000 --> 44:48.000
Okay, my advice I need, how do I not suck so bad at it?

44:48.000 --> 44:51.000
You can't. It's impossible.

44:51.000 --> 44:55.000
It's just like I was thinking about buying Unreal Tournament 3.

44:55.000 --> 45:01.000
For some reason I thought there was a single player mode in it, but I'm an idiot because Unreal Tournament does not have single player.

45:01.000 --> 45:04.000
Well, I mean, it does, but it's still fucking Unreal Tournament, you know?

45:04.000 --> 45:07.000
I was like, ooh, I can make mods and stuff. Mods are cool.

45:07.000 --> 45:13.000
Because I'm thinking like Quake, you know, back when they had mods like Kujo and the grappling hook.

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
Because I love Kujo and the grappling hook.

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
I know, I'm weird.

45:17.000 --> 45:20.000
But I'm not going to buy that game anymore.

45:20.000 --> 45:30.000
Well, you know, also I want to say about the whole Halo 3 story thing, I think there was a great video floating around out there that was basically Halo 1 and 2's story kind of condensed into a few minutes.

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
That was something you could watch to catch up.

45:32.000 --> 45:36.000
I have the collector's edition, I just haven't watched any of the videos on that second disc.

45:36.000 --> 45:39.000
Aren't you glad you spent all that extra money?

45:39.000 --> 45:43.000
Hey, the only reason I bought the collector's edition was for the video calibration tool.

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
That is the only reason.

45:45.000 --> 45:48.000
And ironically enough, I have not used the video calibration tool.

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
You tool!

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
Ouch.

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
Alright, moving on.

45:54.000 --> 46:00.000
Next email comes to us from Johnny S. because they didn't sign it.

46:00.000 --> 46:04.000
Remember, if you don't sign your emails, I don't know what to call you, so I'll just use your first name and last initial.

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
Loki, I have a question.

46:06.000 --> 46:09.000
I'm thinking about buying an 80 gigabyte PlayStation 3.

46:09.000 --> 46:14.000
I've got to have Metal Gear Solid 4 and Grand Theft 5, no, I'm sorry, Gran Turismo 5.

46:14.000 --> 46:17.000
But other than that, is there anything else that warrants my 600 bucks?

46:17.000 --> 46:24.000
Maybe Resistance, Fallen Man, and depending on what kind of games you like, maybe Uncharted.

46:24.000 --> 46:30.000
Ratchet and Clank, you know, my friend's been playing tons of Ratchet and Clank, and I've watched him play a little bit of it.

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
I'm just not that impressed by it.

46:32.000 --> 46:35.000
But then again, I didn't play any of the other Ratchet and Clank games.

46:35.000 --> 46:39.000
I don't know, he loves Ratchet and Clank, he loves that game, so maybe that game.

46:39.000 --> 46:40.000
Heavenly Sword, maybe.

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
The Blu-Ray player?

46:42.000 --> 46:48.000
Blu-Ray's good, if you like online shooter games, maybe like Warhawk might be good.

46:48.000 --> 46:53.000
You know, there's stuff out there definitely, but not as much as maybe like Xbox 360.

46:53.000 --> 46:56.000
But just, you know, wait, be patient about it, I guess.

46:56.000 --> 47:01.000
And if you can get your hands on the 60 gig system, you'll probably appreciate that a lot better.

47:01.000 --> 47:08.000
Because to be honest, you know, you don't really need the extra hard drive space right now.

47:08.000 --> 47:11.000
There really is not a lot to download on there.

47:11.000 --> 47:16.000
Is there anything on the PlayStation Network worth getting?

47:16.000 --> 47:20.000
Yeah, the first thing you need to get is a Japanese account, that's for sure.

47:20.000 --> 47:26.000
You can do that for free, so I recommend looking up on the internet to get a Japanese account and do that.

47:26.000 --> 47:30.000
Because when you do that, you'll really get some really kickass demos from Japan.

47:30.000 --> 47:33.000
You'll also be able to download the Gran Turismo 5 prologue demo,

47:33.000 --> 47:39.000
and especially if you're interested in Gran Turismo 5, and stuff like that.

47:39.000 --> 47:42.000
Because they get a lot of demos and stuff that we don't get out over here.

47:42.000 --> 47:50.000
So do that. If you want to check out some of the games that are on there, like Flow is pretty fun,

47:50.000 --> 47:54.000
Everyday Shooter is supposed to be good, Pain just came up.

47:54.000 --> 47:58.000
That might be something I like, but I don't know.

47:58.000 --> 48:04.000
And then maybe if you're into Tekken 5, they have the Tekken 5 multiplayer online game.

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
And you know what game I strongly recommend?

48:06.000 --> 48:11.000
It's Africa!

48:11.000 --> 48:15.000
I love playing that game, it's less than a condition.

48:15.000 --> 48:16.000
That's the only way I'm playing that game.

48:16.000 --> 48:20.000
I gotta say, despite all the smack we're talking about, the game looks fucking gorgeous.

48:20.000 --> 48:21.000
Yeah, it looks awesome.

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
This is like a game I can just sit and look at.

48:23.000 --> 48:26.000
Yeah, and you know what else I can sit and look at?

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
Discovery Channel HD.

48:28.000 --> 48:29.000
And porn.

48:29.000 --> 48:34.000
I don't just look at games, I like to play them too.

48:34.000 --> 48:37.000
But there are a lot of people that do like to just watch other people play games.

48:37.000 --> 48:40.000
Anyway, we've got to move on and get to some more emails.

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
Furgatron writes us and says,

48:42.000 --> 48:46.000
I know this email is late, but I'm seriously behind my list of podcasts.

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
It's titled Late Entry Episode 255.

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
So it's a few episodes back.

48:50.000 --> 48:53.000
Take-Two Interactive had to dish out about 2 million for this hot coffee leak.

48:53.000 --> 48:58.000
I'm concerned about the programmer or project manager responsible for the original hot coffee feature.

48:58.000 --> 48:59.000
What's going to happen to them?

48:59.000 --> 49:03.000
Did they get lynched, raped, or mobbed by corporate?

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
I don't know.

49:05.000 --> 49:06.000
We never really heard about it.

49:06.000 --> 49:09.000
But those type of internal things are company dealings.

49:09.000 --> 49:10.000
We never know.

49:10.000 --> 49:15.000
I imagine there were multiple people responsible for it,

49:15.000 --> 49:18.000
and it was probably part of the original concept as it was.

49:18.000 --> 49:21.000
And if you think way back to when we were first talking about hot coffee,

49:21.000 --> 49:26.000
I think the whole problem was is that the mode was never taken out of the game.

49:26.000 --> 49:29.000
Whatever pointed to the mode,

49:29.000 --> 49:32.000
if you think about programming, the way it works every game is like a giant flow chart, right?

49:32.000 --> 49:33.000
So basically what they did,

49:33.000 --> 49:38.000
they took that arrow out that enables something to go to the sex mode and turn it on,

49:38.000 --> 49:42.000
and all that cheat did was put that arrow back in, basically.

49:42.000 --> 49:45.000
So I don't think one person was solely responsible for that.

49:45.000 --> 49:50.000
I think that was part of a larger screw-up, basically.

49:50.000 --> 49:56.000
That's why the game took so freaking long to come out in its sanitized version,

49:56.000 --> 49:59.000
because they had to go back and actually take out the entire thing,

49:59.000 --> 50:04.000
and to be honest, if there's some content that's in the game that they leave in there,

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
people will find it.

50:06.000 --> 50:09.000
I mean, shit, they found stuff in Zelda, like the debug levels.

50:09.000 --> 50:12.000
They found stuff in Wind Waker, of course.

50:12.000 --> 50:17.000
They found stuff in pretty much any game that has stuff hidden in there.

50:17.000 --> 50:20.000
Smash Brothers, hidden characters, stuff like that.

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
We were getting into a talk earlier about,

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
just want to say, before I get back to the email,

50:24.000 --> 50:25.000
because now I'm looking at chat room,

50:25.000 --> 50:28.000
and we talked about porn earlier,

50:28.000 --> 50:32.000
and DML wanted to remind us that the porn industry actually supports HD DVD,

50:32.000 --> 50:33.000
not Blu-Ray.

50:33.000 --> 50:34.000
They support both.

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
They support wherever people are going to buy shit.

50:36.000 --> 50:39.000
Legezaku says Blu-Ray forbids porn, hope you know.

50:39.000 --> 50:40.000
Hmm.

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
That's bullshit, because I know Pirates,

50:42.000 --> 50:46.000
that porno that's pretty funny, actually, high production value,

50:46.000 --> 50:49.000
is on both Blu-Ray and HD DVD.

50:49.000 --> 50:50.000
Oh, snap.

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
Let's see, what else did Fergotron say here?

50:52.000 --> 50:56.000
Sky, you mentioned that you play a lot of WoW instead of other games.

50:56.000 --> 50:57.000
I'm in the same situation.

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
I have only a limited amount of time to play games,

50:59.000 --> 51:00.000
so when it comes time to play,

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
I end up playing whatever game I can get the most out of,

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
which ends up being WoW.

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
What server do you play on, and what's your character's name?

51:06.000 --> 51:09.000
Mine is, I don't know if he wants me to read this on the air.

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
So there you have it.

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
Hey, if you want to find out more information

51:13.000 --> 51:17.000
about the Orange Lounge Guild that we all play on in WoW,

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
it's all on the forums, so check it out.

51:19.000 --> 51:20.000
Forums.

51:20.000 --> 51:21.000
Ah, nice plug, huh?

51:21.000 --> 51:24.000
Go to orangeloungevideo.com and click on Forums.

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
I don't know if my character name's posted,

51:26.000 --> 51:29.000
but if you join the Guild, it won't be hard to figure out who I am.

51:29.000 --> 51:33.000
Honestly, if you listen to this show long enough, you'll know.

51:33.000 --> 51:38.000
The last email tonight comes to us from Ali, I believe it's Ali.

51:38.000 --> 51:43.000
I was listening to Episode 255, Part B, and you just mentioned Logo.

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
Oh my God, I was a beast at Logo.

51:45.000 --> 51:48.000
I remember me and my one friend had a working Tetris on Logo.

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
You have no idea how hard that is.

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
However, because the language was highly inefficient,

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
it would go wicked slow.

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
They had this running on a 1 GHz Celeron,

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
it was called MicroWorlds on those machines,

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
and the processor would be maxed out,

52:00.000 --> 52:03.000
the fan would be going full tilt to play Tetris.

52:03.000 --> 52:04.000
Yeah, I'm a nerd.

52:04.000 --> 52:07.000
Other than that, I remember I would make some hardcore art with Logo,

52:07.000 --> 52:08.000
fractals and stuff.

52:08.000 --> 52:09.000
Good times.

52:09.000 --> 52:10.000
Good times.

52:10.000 --> 52:13.000
I only ever had Logo on the Commodore 64.

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
And for a reminder for those that weren't listening that week,

52:15.000 --> 52:18.000
Logo is that language where you have the little turtle

52:18.000 --> 52:22.000
and you would point, you know, pen down, up 10, right 10,

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
you know, and all that stuff.

52:24.000 --> 52:27.000
And it was basically how people of a younger age

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
could learn programming more easily.

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
Why are you giving me dirty looks, Rice Princess?

52:31.000 --> 52:34.000
I'm not giving you dirty looks, Rice Princess.

52:34.000 --> 52:35.000
Not right then.

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
I'm just pooping.

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
That's what it looks like.

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
Yeah, mind your own business, Tom.

52:41.000 --> 52:42.000
Try not to in the room.

52:42.000 --> 52:43.000
All right.

52:43.000 --> 52:44.000
Mailbag at OrangeLunchrated.com

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
if you want to send us some more email.

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
Skyline will be open very soon.

52:48.000 --> 52:51.000
We have about three more stories for you guys before we get there, though.

52:51.000 --> 52:52.000
Get your dialing fingers ready.

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
1-877-GAME-OLR.

52:54.000 --> 52:57.000
Our username on Skype, OrangeLunchRadio,

52:57.000 --> 52:58.000
right after a few more news stories.

52:58.000 --> 52:59.000
All right.

52:59.000 --> 53:02.000
Including one talking about Boom Boom Rocket.

53:02.000 --> 53:06.000
Of course, we mentioned it in the past about an upcoming update.

53:06.000 --> 53:11.000
Well, now it's live and there's a little bit of bonus with that.

53:11.000 --> 53:15.000
Not only will you be able to play with dance mats and guitars,

53:15.000 --> 53:19.000
but you will also be able to play five new songs,

53:19.000 --> 53:24.000
including Cannon and Dee, Sugar High, Sting of the Bumblebee,

53:24.000 --> 53:29.000
Explode to Joy.

53:29.000 --> 53:32.000
That's what it sounds like Rice Princess was doing earlier in the corner.

53:32.000 --> 53:33.000
It was.

53:33.000 --> 53:38.000
It looks like Ein Klein rock music.

53:38.000 --> 53:39.000
I downloaded the five new songs.

53:39.000 --> 53:40.000
They're okay.

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
They are more rock influenced than Synthy,

53:42.000 --> 53:46.000
but I wasn't that impressed because they are, again,

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
just classic remix songs.

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
And one other thing I was going to say,

53:50.000 --> 53:54.000
I believe that you can also use the rock band drums for this as well,

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
if you are ever so inclined.

53:56.000 --> 53:57.000
If you're really bored.

53:57.000 --> 53:58.000
Yeah, really bored.

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
Really bored.

54:00.000 --> 54:06.000
And basically, the five songs are free for right now until December 16th.

54:06.000 --> 54:09.000
Then afterwards, it's going to set you back 250 Microsoft points.

54:09.000 --> 54:13.000
So if you have a chance, get on live, get the update, get the free songs,

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
play it later.

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
Even if you don't think you'll want to play them now,

54:17.000 --> 54:18.000
get it anyway while it's still free.

54:18.000 --> 54:19.000
Exactly.

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
Free is always good.

54:21.000 --> 54:22.000
Free is good.

54:22.000 --> 54:26.000
Unless it's Yaris, in which case it's not good.

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
Free is good.

54:28.000 --> 54:32.000
Well, I know there is so much love out there for Portal

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
and the Weighted Companion Cube.

54:34.000 --> 54:38.000
And this is a whole how to do it yourself guide

54:38.000 --> 54:41.000
to making a weighted companion cube paperweight.

54:41.000 --> 54:44.000
It comes from the site demon-alley.com.

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
If you go to demon-alley.com slash WCC,

54:46.000 --> 54:51.000
you get a whole do it yourself guide on how to make a weighted companion cube.

54:51.000 --> 54:55.000
But I think the problem is you still have to be somewhat good at art to make this.

54:55.000 --> 54:59.000
But if you think about it, a lot of the principles you learn here,

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
you could apply to a lot of different crafts.

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
I mean, who's to say you can make a weighted companion cube out of it?

55:03.000 --> 55:07.000
Is that with clay or is that like styrofoam that they're carving or something?

55:07.000 --> 55:10.000
It says the materials in it are, I quote,

55:10.000 --> 55:16.000
Sculpey, armature wire, acrylic paints, sandpaper and or steel wool, sculpting tools,

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
and optional, terpenoid.

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
Okay, so it's clay. It's Sculpey clay.

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
Yeah, Sculpey is clay.

55:22.000 --> 55:23.000
So that's what they use.

55:23.000 --> 55:26.000
And you actually, I guess, make a cube out of it and then carve into it.

55:26.000 --> 55:30.000
And then you bake it and then you color it, basically.

55:30.000 --> 55:33.000
And then you feed it to your cat or make your cat look at it.

55:33.000 --> 55:36.000
So, cute.

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
And Sculpey, if I remember correctly,

55:38.000 --> 55:41.000
because my sister makes a ton of shit out of that stuff.

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
She loves doing that.

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
You can use it. You can fire it in your oven.

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
Frisbee says that needs to be my Christmas gift.

55:47.000 --> 55:51.000
That might be actually a fun Christmas gift for people.

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
Fun.

55:53.000 --> 55:54.000
Well, you know.

55:54.000 --> 55:55.000
Fun-tastic.

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
I don't know about you guys, but I like homemade gifts.

55:57.000 --> 56:02.000
I think they mean a lot more than something bought at Target on clearance.

56:02.000 --> 56:05.000
Well, then I'll poop in a bag for you.

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
I can make a lot of those.

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
You guys are obscene.

56:09.000 --> 56:12.000
Enough for all of my friends.

56:12.000 --> 56:13.000
No, I know what you mean, Rob.

56:13.000 --> 56:14.000
I like homemade stuff.

56:14.000 --> 56:17.000
Let's make Arcs and Craps together for Christmas gifts.

56:17.000 --> 56:18.000
No.

56:18.000 --> 56:19.000
I'm going to get you a coaster for Christmas.

56:19.000 --> 56:20.000
Don't you want one of those?

56:20.000 --> 56:24.000
I'm going to make candy with the aqua dots in it.

56:24.000 --> 56:25.000
Like, you know, cookies.

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
What are these special chips?

56:27.000 --> 56:28.000
Aqua dots.

56:28.000 --> 56:29.000
Oh, crap.

56:29.000 --> 56:30.000
I'm tripping.

56:30.000 --> 56:31.000
Want to make out.

56:31.000 --> 56:34.000
Date-rape-licious.

56:34.000 --> 56:35.000
Yeah, that's fun.

56:35.000 --> 56:36.000
That's terrible.

56:36.000 --> 56:39.000
Special Rice Krispie treats.

56:39.000 --> 56:42.000
Oh, they're special already.

56:42.000 --> 56:43.000
Anyways.

56:43.000 --> 56:48.200
And then another game, as I mentioned earlier, possibly going to import Wii Fit has come

56:48.200 --> 56:49.200
out in Japan.

56:49.200 --> 56:53.000
And, of course, there are lines for it.

56:53.000 --> 56:56.200
Lots of people looking to play this game, including there's going to be a lot of cool

56:56.200 --> 56:57.200
stuff in there.

56:57.200 --> 57:01.000
There's yoga, which looks pretty cool.

57:01.000 --> 57:07.000
There's balance, including they have a skiing game, soccer, ski jump, some sort of, like,

57:07.000 --> 57:10.000
monkey ball thing, and tight rope.

57:10.000 --> 57:14.000
And then cardio, they have hula hoop, jogging, and dancing.

57:14.000 --> 57:15.000
Awesome.

57:15.000 --> 57:16.000
Can't wait for it.

57:16.000 --> 57:19.000
This game is fucking expensive if you import it.

57:19.000 --> 57:20.000
It's like $189.

57:20.000 --> 57:21.000
Oh, my God.

57:21.000 --> 57:22.000
Oh, Jesus.

57:22.000 --> 57:23.000
Why so much?

57:23.000 --> 57:24.000
Is that just because of the shipping and everything?

57:24.000 --> 57:25.000
Import.

57:25.000 --> 57:28.000
Because the import fees can't be that high.

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
High demand, so.

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
I still might get it, though.

57:32.000 --> 57:33.000
Oh, my God.

57:33.000 --> 57:34.000
You're insane.

57:34.000 --> 57:37.000
Why can't you just wait a few months for the version to come out here in the U.S.?

57:37.000 --> 57:40.000
Because I have bonus money to burn, and I can do it that way.

57:40.000 --> 57:41.000
Give me money.

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
I'll spend it on a good cause.

57:43.000 --> 57:44.000
I know.

57:44.000 --> 57:45.000
Oh, you're crazy.

57:45.000 --> 57:46.000
All right.

57:46.000 --> 57:51.000
We are now going to go to the Skype lines at www.orangelandrado.com.

57:51.000 --> 57:54.000
Click on interact with us, and you can get all the information on the Skype line.

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
Our user name is orangelandrado on Skype.

57:56.000 --> 57:59.800
Or if that doesn't work for you, all that technical stuff is too much for you, you can

57:59.800 --> 58:03.800
always give us a call on our 800 line, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

58:03.800 --> 58:06.300
I believe we have a call right now.

58:06.300 --> 58:08.800
Hello, caller, are you there on Orange Land Radio?

58:08.800 --> 58:10.800
Hello, everyone.

58:10.800 --> 58:11.800
Hi.

58:11.800 --> 58:12.800
Who's this?

58:12.800 --> 58:15.800
It's Rice Princesses on behalf of Rana.

58:15.800 --> 58:18.800
Ah, Rice Princesses, better half, or other BF.

58:18.800 --> 58:19.800
Oh, other boyfriend.

58:19.800 --> 58:20.800
Oh, whoa.

58:20.800 --> 58:21.800
Oh, snap.

58:21.800 --> 58:22.800
Ooh.

58:22.800 --> 58:23.800
Ooh, competition.

58:23.800 --> 58:24.800
All right.

58:24.800 --> 58:25.800
You know she poops a lot, right?

58:25.800 --> 58:26.800
And fart.

58:26.800 --> 58:27.800
Don't forget that.

58:27.800 --> 58:29.800
Rama, what's on your mind?

58:29.800 --> 58:31.800
A couple of things.

58:31.800 --> 58:36.800
The first thing I want to talk about is the whole GameStop charging more money for accessories.

58:36.800 --> 58:42.000
I mean, I've seen them do this on a regular basis because when BeatMania came out, I went

58:42.000 --> 58:47.080
over to Best Buy and they had it for like, I think it was $59, and I went over to GameStop,

58:47.080 --> 58:48.080
they had it for $69.

58:48.080 --> 58:53.640
I mean, normally the games are no price everywhere else, but when it comes to anything with an

58:53.640 --> 58:57.560
accessory, they're known for charging $5 to $10 more for it.

58:57.560 --> 58:58.840
That's why you got to shop around.

58:58.840 --> 59:01.360
Do they price match there, out of curiosity?

59:01.360 --> 59:03.560
No, because they don't advertise.

59:03.560 --> 59:04.560
That's what it is.

59:04.560 --> 59:05.560
Interesting.

59:05.560 --> 59:06.560
Yeah.

59:06.560 --> 59:09.680
Plus that they do a lot of sales with huge games and stuff they don't price match.

59:09.680 --> 59:12.360
Well, that's why you want to do your research before you go out and buy.

59:12.360 --> 59:17.520
I mean, sometimes GameStop may have the best deal, like Final Fantasy XII had that collector's

59:17.520 --> 59:20.320
edition that was only available at GameStop that had some extra stuff with it.

59:20.320 --> 59:23.400
You know, sometimes it's a good place to get games, but sometimes you're better off going

59:23.400 --> 59:24.400
somewhere else.

59:24.400 --> 59:29.400
Yeah, I did go to GameStop to get my collector's edition, but other than that, there wasn't

59:29.400 --> 59:30.400
going to be one.

59:30.400 --> 59:32.760
I would have gone to Best Buy.

59:32.760 --> 59:37.840
I remember when Nintendogs first came out, I ended up going to Best Buy.

59:37.840 --> 59:41.920
I was going to go to GameStop, but that day I found out there was a $5 gift card or something

59:41.920 --> 59:45.440
you would get if you bought it at Best Buy.

59:45.440 --> 59:52.560
That's why that website CheapAssGamer, that's why that website is so insanely popular, because

59:52.560 --> 59:55.320
it's like gamers getting together to share their resources about where to find the best

59:55.320 --> 59:56.320
deal.

59:56.320 --> 59:57.320
Seriously.

59:57.320 --> 59:58.320
Mm-hmm.

59:58.320 --> 59:59.320
Whoever thought of that, honestly?

59:59.320 --> 01:00:00.320
Genius idea.

01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:01.320
Genius idea.

01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:02.320
Wish I'd thought of it.

01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:03.320
I'm jealous.

01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:04.320
Anything else?

01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:10.920
Yeah, I want to talk about this whole controversy of this guy getting fired over his honest

01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:14.080
review of Kane & Lynch.

01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:18.560
This is going to open up a lawsuit for wrongful termination, because I think it's really fucked

01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:21.840
up that someone gets fired for their honest opinion on something, you know?

01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:22.840
Mm-hmm.

01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:24.800
I mean, is that fair, you know?

01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:29.400
But Rama, like I said earlier in the show, we don't know for sure that's the reason yet.

01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:33.880
And especially in the state of California, where this guy works, we have this whole law

01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:39.440
about the whole at-will employment, where basically an employee can leave an organization

01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:43.640
no questions asked, an employer can terminate them, essentially, no questions asked.

01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:46.160
It's kind of to avoid those types of situations.

01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:51.000
In order for him to claim wrongful termination, it would almost have to be like they were

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:56.720
setting him up in a way, or they were like, you know, trapping him into this or something,

01:00:56.720 --> 01:00:57.720
you know?

01:00:57.720 --> 01:01:02.240
Like, I don't know, it'd be kind of, it'd be very hard for them to pull it off.

01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:04.040
I don't know if I'd go that far.

01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:07.720
I think this guy's going to land a job somewhere else in the industry, even though I had no

01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:10.800
idea who he was before this week, he's obviously very well respected.

01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:15.200
Hell, if the people at 1UP love him so much, I think it might be kind of, you know, and

01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:19.120
they're only a couple blocks away, I think that kind of shows you where he might go,

01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:20.120
but who knows?

01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:21.120
It works.

01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:24.680
At the same time, if you're a talented writer, maybe he'll decide this whole thing hasn't

01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:28.800
jaded from the games industry and he's going to go review movies or go write for a newspaper.

01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:31.040
It's really up to him.

01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:32.040
Pretty much.

01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:33.040
I know there are other states that are like that.

01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:36.160
I know here in New York, it's not at Will State.

01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:41.320
They have to find a reason for you to be fired, unless you're like, during your first 30 or

01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:42.320
90 days.

01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:47.360
Then they can just like, oh, fired, done, you know, whatever.

01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:48.360
Right.

01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:53.840
Well, Rama, do you have any other comments or anything else you want to talk about tonight?

01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:56.560
Last thing, and then I'll be on My Merry Little Way.

01:01:56.560 --> 01:01:59.880
I'm probably one of the few people in the chat room that's really against this whole

01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:02.920
Activision Vivendi buyout thing.

01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:05.020
I'm just really appalled by it.

01:02:05.020 --> 01:02:07.520
Are you sure you're not being a little tinfoil hat-ish?

01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:08.520
No.

01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:09.520
I know.

01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:11.320
What's so scary about it?

01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:17.120
It's not scary, it's just that Activision is like one of the last long-running independent

01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:19.040
game publishers going back to the 70s.

01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:24.680
They have like this long, decorative career of great things that they've done, and now

01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:27.960
boom, they're part of some like multi-global unit.

01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:30.520
It's like, look at Atari, for example.

01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:37.120
They wanted like a good thing going, and then Infogrames bought them, renamed it to Atari,

01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:38.400
and now look at them.

01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:41.040
I guess that's true.

01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:44.940
I guess maybe this is a little bit of a fear, but you know, mergers aren't necessarily always

01:02:44.940 --> 01:02:45.940
a bad thing.

01:02:45.940 --> 01:02:47.800
Square Enix didn't work out so bad.

01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:52.760
I just find the Square Enix merger funny because Square is doing more profits than Enix.

01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:57.120
Enix walks up out of nowhere with a big thing of cash, and they're like, hi, we're buying

01:02:57.120 --> 01:02:59.120
you.

01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:07.920
The thing is that this is not really like a merger per se, it's just that all Vivendi

01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:11.360
has is just like a controlling stake in the company.

01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:14.160
They haven't said it's a merger or anything, you know?

01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:20.400
All right, well, we'll see if your tinfoil hat things come true or not.

01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:21.600
I hope not, though.

01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:28.920
I'm not scared yet, but you know, yeah, when we start seeing the whole, you know, the orcs

01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:32.840
and torrents showing up in Guitar Hero, then I will be a little scared.

01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:33.840
All right.

01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:35.440
We'll see what happens, as you said.

01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:36.440
All right.

01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:37.440
Well, take care, Rama.

01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:38.440
We've got to get some more calls.

01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:39.440
You got it.

01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:40.440
Bye-bye.

01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:41.440
Bye, Rama.

01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:46.000
7 Game O-L-R is the magic number to call, or you can give us a call on our Skype line.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.400
Orange Lounge Radio is our username on Skype.

01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:50.200
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:51.200
Who's this?

01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:52.200
It's Puppy.

01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:53.200
Hello, Puppy.

01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:54.200
What's on your mind, Puppy?

01:03:54.200 --> 01:04:03.360
Oh, just a lot of stuff, but mostly just a lot of rock band issues.

01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:04.360
What's going on?

01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:05.360
Did your stuff break?

01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:13.280
Yeah, my guitar got that bad strum bar problem that's been popping up with a lot of people.

01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:15.480
I know you can fix that yourself.

01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:22.880
Yeah, but I'm not that handy with electronics, so I'd rather not risk tinkering with it.

01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:23.880
Or you're just lazy.

01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:24.880
It's not lazy.

01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:26.280
It really isn't that hard.

01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:30.600
You basically unscrew the back, and what it is is the contact switch in there gets kind

01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:35.400
of, I guess, turned, and all you have to do is just loosen the screw, line it back up,

01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:37.840
and tighten it again, and then you're good to go.

01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:41.400
That doesn't sound too hard when Loki says it.

01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:46.400
Well, I've actually got my thumb away already, man.

01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:50.480
Oh, your guitar's already set back, because I was going to say, if you want, if Op 11's

01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:53.960
back up and running next week and you trust Loki enough, we could take your guitar apart

01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:55.360
live on air and fix it.

01:04:55.360 --> 01:04:59.560
Apparently, though, they actually are giving away free games, too, if you have your guitar

01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:01.520
fixed, you get a free game winner.

01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:05.240
But they haven't said what the game is yet, right?

01:05:05.240 --> 01:05:11.520
I read that story earlier, and I think it said that people that had put their oars in

01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:16.720
for replacement like a week ago, and it was getting delayed because of a lack of stock

01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:18.880
for them to send out, and they were getting that free game.

01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:21.840
Yeah, I think I heard our old buddy Bobby Black Wolf talking about that, because he's

01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:26.080
been having problems with not just the drums, but now his guitar as well, and they sent

01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:29.920
him an email because his drums got delayed, but then they told him it was the guitar in

01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:33.480
the email, so he's just all kinds of confused, and I was listening to that on his show this

01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:36.600
week, and it's just kind of unfortunate.

01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:40.560
Makes me glad I didn't buy the whole Rock Band bundle, although I've got to say, on

01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:44.080
my Guitar Hero 2 controller, I have the Explorer controller, which is pretty much what I'm

01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:47.560
using to play Guitar Hero 3 in Rock Band, my yellow button is sticking a little bit,

01:05:47.560 --> 01:05:51.240
which is pissing me off, because I don't want to buy a new controller.

01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:52.240
But I guess that's what I get for not touching the game.

01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:57.240
I ended up using my Guitar Hero 3 controller for my guitar, because my guitar actually

01:05:57.240 --> 01:06:04.560
started acting up only like four or five days after I got the system, and it just got progressively

01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:07.520
worse, and now it's to the point where the down strum doesn't work at all.

01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:11.440
So the Guitar Hero 3 controller works on Rock Band?

01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:15.080
My Guitar Hero 3 controller, my wireless one, does work on my system.

01:06:15.080 --> 01:06:18.200
It's only the PlayStation 3 version that does not play nice with each other.

01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:19.200
Oh, I thought that worked on...

01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:22.560
Okay, maybe I'll get the Guitar Hero 3 controller then, because I do kind of want a wireless

01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:23.560
controller.

01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:24.560
That'll be fun.

01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:25.560
We'll see.

01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:26.560
That's a lot of money.

01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:31.360
The wireless controller is nice, but I like the design for the Rock Band controller a

01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:32.360
lot better.

01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:34.760
I love the design on the Rock Band controller.

01:06:34.760 --> 01:06:37.380
It's a bummer that they're having all the problems they are.

01:06:37.380 --> 01:06:40.480
Hopefully by the time they start selling them separately next year, they can fix some of

01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:41.480
those problems.

01:06:41.480 --> 01:06:42.760
I really hope so.

01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:47.160
Yeah, that would be nice, because having an extra controller would be good for parties

01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:48.560
and whatnot.

01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:49.560
It'd be nice.

01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:55.040
They didn't get Guitar Hero 3, so I'm sure there's very few of those people out there

01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:56.040
at this point.

01:06:56.040 --> 01:07:01.960
All right, well, anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight, Puppy?

01:07:01.960 --> 01:07:07.520
Not much, other than the fact that I finished Assassin's Creed and I jumped up and screamed

01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:08.520
at the ending.

01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:11.600
I heard the ending is kind of shocking a lot of people.

01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:12.600
Very interesting.

01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:14.600
I'd be very curious about that.

01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:18.000
I wouldn't want to go into details and spoil it, but yeah.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
You don't see it coming.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:21.000
Interesting.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:24.080
Isn't the ending supposedly kind of a trip, too?

01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:30.600
Yeah, the ending itself is really trippy, and the way it's kind of set up is that they

01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:34.280
basically knew ahead of time that this was going to be a trilogy.

01:07:34.280 --> 01:07:37.000
But the beginning is weird, too, right?

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:38.360
Oh, yeah.

01:07:38.360 --> 01:07:41.360
When I first started, I'm like, okay, what's going on here?

01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:46.600
This doesn't look like a game in the Crusades.

01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:52.120
It took me a good two or three hours into it before I started to catch the whole timeline

01:07:52.120 --> 01:07:53.120
of the game.

01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:54.120
All right.

01:07:54.120 --> 01:07:57.920
Well, Puppy, we've got to let you go to get more calls, but thanks so much for the call,

01:07:57.920 --> 01:07:58.920
all right?

01:07:58.920 --> 01:07:59.920
All right.

01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:00.920
Bye-bye.

01:08:00.920 --> 01:08:05.360
If you have a call, you want to get through to us, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype.

01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:08.520
Orange Lounge Radio is the username on Skype.

01:08:08.520 --> 01:08:11.480
Waiting for a call to drop.

01:08:11.480 --> 01:08:13.480
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:08:13.480 --> 01:08:14.480
Who's this?

01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:15.480
Good evening, guys.

01:08:15.480 --> 01:08:16.680
It's DMN.

01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:18.440
Hello, DMN.

01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:21.120
What's on your mind, my friend?

01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:23.400
First of all, if you haven't bought Mass Effect, buy it.

01:08:23.400 --> 01:08:25.720
It's the game of the year.

01:08:25.720 --> 01:08:28.640
I'm waiting on pins and needles to check it out.

01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:29.640
I'm so excited.

01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:32.360
I'm supposed to be borrowing my friend's copy very soon, so we'll see.

01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:34.920
I got a free copy from my buddy at Microsoft.

01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:38.080
But anyway, that is not what I call.

01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:44.080
I have called because I think everybody who listens to this show should thank you, Loki,

01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:48.240
Max Dacher, and everybody else who reports news on this station because we don't get

01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:51.240
paid to do a damn thing.

01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:57.000
The reason I say this is the story that led into the show tonight was Jeff Gertzman getting

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:02.760
fired from GameSpot over his review of Kane & Lynch, which was an acceptable review.

01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:08.360
Everybody gave that review at the most a seven across the board.

01:09:08.360 --> 01:09:15.240
The fact that Eidos dropped their advertising, which then I don't know what happened, but

01:09:15.240 --> 01:09:22.880
it forced him to get fired, I think that's the most lowest unobjected thing I've ever

01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:25.920
seen a media publication do.

01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:31.920
But again, do you think you might be filling in some gaps with hearsay, though?

01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:36.560
That's the only thing I'm kind of challenging here is that, yes, we know Eidos pulled the

01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:41.520
bad campaign, but did they necessarily do it because of the bad review itself?

01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:45.000
Did they maybe do it because of all this fallout that happened because of it?

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.360
Well, I mean, not up to then.

01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:54.480
I was going on Eidos' forums this morning, and I saw people telling Eidos shame on them

01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:58.400
for doing what they did, and those threads were getting locked and deleted, which means

01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:04.640
I think Eidos knows a little more than they want to say about the situation.

01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:07.440
And I just hate the gaming companies being so intimidating.

01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:12.200
If I recall, we had Beautiful Katamari.

01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:18.400
We had an exclusive release date, and we were intimidated by Namco to pull that, because

01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:21.960
I want to say, what was it, 1UP?

01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:26.600
Apparently bought the rights to that, which I think is retarded.

01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:29.240
I don't think anybody should ever have to buy news.

01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:31.320
I don't think anybody should have to.

01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:35.880
Companies should not be involved only when it's purchasing games and or the gaming review

01:10:35.880 --> 01:10:36.880
magazines.

01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:42.640
I don't think that the companies should be in bed with the gaming review magazines ever.

01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:47.680
It's going to create bad situations like this, it's going to blow things wide open, it's

01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:49.400
going to make a lot of these publishers look bad.

01:10:49.400 --> 01:10:50.680
Eidos has lost my business.

01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:52.840
I was going to buy Conan and I Boring Adventures.

01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:55.280
I'm taking my $50 and going elsewhere with that now.

01:10:55.280 --> 01:11:01.840
As we referenced earlier in the show, and you do definitely bring up a source subject

01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:07.440
around these parts, but it's a fair comparison, so fine.

01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:11.800
It just goes to show you that there's a lot of shady things that go on behind the scenes,

01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:17.520
and that's why a lot of this corporate stuff has a very sour taste in my mouth a lot of

01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:19.160
the times.

01:11:19.160 --> 01:11:26.120
If anything, I'm very interested to see whether it be mob mentality or not, there's going

01:11:26.120 --> 01:11:31.800
to be a lot of people that are going to open themselves up to getting the news from gamers

01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:34.160
who aren't necessarily paid to do it.

01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:38.320
I'm very interested to see where that takes us, the independent folks.

01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:44.020
I would honestly say if this were to happen to Orange Lounge Radio, the same situation

01:11:44.020 --> 01:11:49.200
with an editor, I think a lot of the listeners here would go away.

01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:54.280
I think it would look bad on Orange Lounge Radio, and that's why I'm glad we're independent.

01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:58.280
That's why I'm glad we're not too coerced by money.

01:11:58.280 --> 01:12:01.960
Crouere-We're the type of people that would have come on air and said, can you believe

01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:05.420
Eidos wants us to pull the ad campaign over this review?

01:12:05.420 --> 01:12:07.720
We kicked them to the curb.

01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:12.760
I guess that's just the difference, but we don't pretend to be a money-making corporation

01:12:12.760 --> 01:12:13.760
either.

01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:14.760
We're not making money.

01:12:14.760 --> 01:12:15.760
That's kind of the sad thing.

01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:16.760
We're making tons of money.

01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:17.760
You just don't know about it.

01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:18.760
Really?

01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:19.760
Where's my cut?

01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:24.760
I blow all of it on crack.

01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:28.280
DMN, anything else you want to share with the listeners?

01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:31.600
We've got to get some more calls, though.

01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:33.240
It's raining like hell in Seattle.

01:12:33.240 --> 01:12:34.240
Have a good night.

01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:35.240
All right.

01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:37.240
Thank you for the weather report, DMN.

01:12:37.240 --> 01:12:38.240
I appreciate it.

01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:41.880
I'm going to log you out.

01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:44.840
That was an even better report than the forecast channel, to be honest.

01:12:44.840 --> 01:12:45.840
We've got more calls.

01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:46.840
We're ringing off the hook tonight.

01:12:46.840 --> 01:12:48.080
Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio.

01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:49.080
Who's this?

01:12:49.080 --> 01:12:50.080
Raven's Dolphin.

01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:51.080
How are you tonight, Sky?

01:12:51.080 --> 01:12:52.080
Hello.

01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:53.080
I'm okay.

01:12:53.080 --> 01:12:54.760
How are you, Raven's Dolphin?

01:12:54.760 --> 01:12:55.760
I'm okay.

01:12:55.760 --> 01:13:00.000
I just want to shed some more light on the Gershman trial, or not Gershman trial, the

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:01.000
Gershman thing.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:02.000
Yes.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:03.000
Not a trial yet.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:04.000
Who knows?

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:05.000
Jumping the gun.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:06.000
See?

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:07.000
Hold on a minute, Raven's Dolphin.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:08.000
See?

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.280
This is exactly what happens when you play the Internet game of telephone.

01:13:10.280 --> 01:13:14.040
Now suddenly on a blog, it's going to show up, oh my God, the Gershman firing case goes

01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:15.040
to trial.

01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:16.160
I heard it on OLR.

01:13:16.160 --> 01:13:17.480
It's true.

01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:18.480
It's not true.

01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:19.480
It's not true.

01:13:19.480 --> 01:13:20.480
I'm right.

01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:21.480
No one will believe that.

01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:22.480
I forgot.

01:13:22.480 --> 01:13:23.480
That's right.

01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:27.300
No one believes the poo that falls out of our mouths every Sunday night on this program,

01:13:27.300 --> 01:13:30.200
if the corporate sites are to be deplete.

01:13:30.200 --> 01:13:33.280
Anyway, what's on your mind, Raven's Dolphin?

01:13:33.280 --> 01:13:34.520
I'm going to shed some light.

01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:37.000
So basically, I did some investigation work.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:41.520
So I usually listen to their podcast, I'm going to withhold their name, and he wasn't

01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:42.520
on it.

01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:43.520
He's always on it.

01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:44.520
He wasn't on it.

01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:49.840
So I'm believing that he got fired before the podcast went live.

01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:50.840
And that's pretty shady.

01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:53.180
And they didn't even mention he went on vacation or anything.

01:13:53.180 --> 01:13:55.020
They just said nothing.

01:13:55.020 --> 01:13:56.840
So that's pretty shady right there.

01:13:56.840 --> 01:13:59.040
When does that particular show come out?

01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:00.160
Wednesday.

01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:03.300
That's the day supposedly he was canned.

01:14:03.300 --> 01:14:04.400
Let's use the word allegedly.

01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:05.400
That makes us sound professional.

01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:06.400
But they recorded it.

01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:10.200
Apparently, Wednesday was the day he was locked out of the office and his boxes were thrown

01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:12.960
out on the curb.

01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:13.960
That just sounds wrong.

01:14:13.960 --> 01:14:18.120
Even, you know, it's going to feel like, I'm going to feel dumb if this happens when he

01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:23.040
goes like, well, it wasn't over Kane and Lynch or he had some girl in the background fondling

01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:24.320
in the GameSpot office.

01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:25.320
I'm going to feel bad.

01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:28.360
Now, see, that would be awesome if that was...

01:14:28.360 --> 01:14:30.240
The man gets a raise.

01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:33.120
That's the kind of teamwork I like to see here.

01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:38.080
This guy was having an illicit affair with somebody else in the office and poor Idus

01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:42.240
gets thrown under the bus over this whole thing.

01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:47.840
I mean, the gaming community would owe these guys one hell of an apology if that came to

01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:48.840
light.

01:14:48.840 --> 01:14:49.840
Never going to happen.

01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:50.840
Yeah, I know.

01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:52.200
It's just funny to imagine these things.

01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:53.200
I don't know.

01:14:53.200 --> 01:14:54.200
I live in a weird world.

01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:56.200
Anyway, sorry, Raven's Dolphin.

01:14:56.200 --> 01:15:01.240
I usually follow GameSpot for years and this guy, I trust the guy, you know, he gives a

01:15:01.240 --> 01:15:05.440
pretty good review and just seeing him on the curve and, you know, and a lot of people

01:15:05.440 --> 01:15:08.180
are boycotting the network now.

01:15:08.180 --> 01:15:13.880
They're canceling their descriptions to GameSpot and I kind of support that.

01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:21.400
DMN wants to know, did the podcasters over on GameSpot sound morose?

01:15:21.400 --> 01:15:23.560
They just went on with their normal lives.

01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:25.980
They just went like, well, they didn't say anything.

01:15:25.980 --> 01:15:32.160
They just went like, we were going on with our podcast and it just felt so weird.

01:15:32.160 --> 01:15:35.840
Felt like they were hiding something and they were.

01:15:35.840 --> 01:15:38.800
Maybe dark soccer really isn't in Alabama, Raven's Dolphin.

01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:41.400
Was she a lawyer?

01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:42.400
No, she is.

01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:43.400
Of course she is.

01:15:43.400 --> 01:15:44.400
Come on.

01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:45.400
We would never do that.

01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:46.840
But yeah, it's just funny.

01:15:46.840 --> 01:15:48.560
Being buried in Alabama.

01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:49.560
Never.

01:15:49.560 --> 01:15:54.280
I'm surprised she hasn't called in, but she's probably sleeping if she flew back tonight.

01:15:54.280 --> 01:16:00.440
But anyway, yeah, it's a lot of answers to come next week.

01:16:00.440 --> 01:16:04.360
I think this is going to be one of the hot coffees of 2007.

01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:08.480
I think we're going to see this pop up again before we know it.

01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:12.680
I can tell you this, as a person that likes GameSpot and I'm the person that I always

01:16:12.680 --> 01:16:14.200
go to GameSpot for my things.

01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:20.160
I always reference to them and this is kind of just, I just can't just go there anymore

01:16:20.160 --> 01:16:22.240
and trust them anymore.

01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:23.240
I respect them.

01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:28.760
I respect Jeff for giving an honest review of the game, even though that it got pulled.

01:16:28.760 --> 01:16:33.980
We don't know until Tuesday, so I respect him for that and I hope he gets a better job.

01:16:33.980 --> 01:16:41.160
You know, I got to say, GameSpot was one of my more, if I was going to go look at corp

01:16:41.160 --> 01:16:46.520
sites, it was probably one of the ones I thought was better written.

01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:48.640
It had a pretty good written.

01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:51.360
It was very professional in a lot of the stuff I read.

01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:55.840
Some of the corp sites feel a little unprofessional to me, but that particular one felt professional

01:16:55.840 --> 01:16:57.680
in some of the things.

01:16:57.680 --> 01:17:01.160
Obviously, when we were in the news a lot, because of the beautiful Katamari and the

01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:05.040
Konami thing, we saw what some of these sites were writing about us and I thought GameSpot

01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:06.040
was probably the most fair.

01:17:06.040 --> 01:17:07.040
There they were.

01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:12.520
They put it in the rumor control instead of the other, like, they mentioned your name.

01:17:12.520 --> 01:17:13.520
That's the thing.

01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:14.520
Interesting.

01:17:14.520 --> 01:17:15.520
Interesting.

01:17:15.520 --> 01:17:16.520
All right.

01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:17.760
Well, Ravenstaufen, any other quick thoughts?

01:17:17.760 --> 01:17:19.440
I'm echoing, so we've got to let you go here.

01:17:19.440 --> 01:17:20.440
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:17:20.440 --> 01:17:21.440
Bye-bye.

01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:22.440
All right.

01:17:22.440 --> 01:17:27.200
If you want to give us a call, we'll take a couple more calls, 877-GAME-OLR, username

01:17:27.200 --> 01:17:28.520
on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.

01:17:28.520 --> 01:17:29.520
Hello.

01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:30.520
You're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:17:30.520 --> 01:17:31.520
Who's this?

01:17:31.520 --> 01:17:32.520
Hey, guys.

01:17:32.520 --> 01:17:33.520
What's up?

01:17:33.520 --> 01:17:34.520
This is Footy Monster.

01:17:34.520 --> 01:17:35.520
Hello, Footy Monster.

01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:36.520
What's up?

01:17:36.520 --> 01:17:37.520
Hi, Footy Monster.

01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:38.520
Nothing much.

01:17:38.520 --> 01:17:39.520
Special hello from Rice Princess over there.

01:17:39.520 --> 01:17:40.520
I haven't talked to you in a while.

01:17:40.520 --> 01:17:41.520
Geez.

01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:42.520
All right.

01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:43.520
What's up?

01:17:43.520 --> 01:17:44.520
I like your avatar on Skype, by the way.

01:17:44.520 --> 01:17:47.840
It's some girl with big boobies.

01:17:47.840 --> 01:17:49.800
Of course, boobs are the win.

01:17:49.800 --> 01:17:53.840
I think this is going to star in Rice Princess' upcoming game, Boobies and Pandas.

01:17:53.840 --> 01:17:54.840
All right.

01:17:54.840 --> 01:17:56.840
What's in your mind, Footy?

01:17:56.840 --> 01:18:04.520
Well, of course, it has to be this whole thing with GameSpot, and here's two things.

01:18:04.520 --> 01:18:09.920
First off, when people are actually looking for reviews, they don't go to one place alone.

01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:13.880
They go to all of the places, and they make an evaluation and a general consensus of what

01:18:13.880 --> 01:18:18.200
they think they want to think of the game after they read all the reviews, not just

01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:19.200
one review.

01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:20.200
That's the first thing.

01:18:20.200 --> 01:18:21.200
That's the second thing.

01:18:21.200 --> 01:18:22.200
Are you sure?

01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:23.200
No.

01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:24.200
Are you sure?

01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:27.080
Because some of those people who are paying for that site and stuff, I don't know.

01:18:27.080 --> 01:18:28.080
Okay.

01:18:28.080 --> 01:18:29.640
Here's what you guys need to do if you're looking at reviews.

01:18:29.640 --> 01:18:31.240
If you're going to spend 60 bucks, if you're going to spend 60 bucks...

01:18:31.240 --> 01:18:34.920
Don't just look at the numbers that they give the game.

01:18:34.920 --> 01:18:39.120
Just look at the pros and cons that they list.

01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:40.120
That's another thing.

01:18:40.120 --> 01:18:41.120
That's another thing.

01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:44.960
People also, that's my second reason, it's like they were pissed, and whatever happened

01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:49.040
happened because of the number and not because of what was written, because I'm sure that

01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:53.920
what he wrote is the same thing that everybody else wrote.

01:18:53.920 --> 01:18:58.160
The problem with that is that they were an advertiser, but also the number didn't fit

01:18:58.160 --> 01:19:03.440
with the PR department, which is usually the problem with everything in this gaming industry

01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:06.440
that we're in.

01:19:06.440 --> 01:19:10.960
We're making this sound like, whatever, this is a huge deal, but in truth, it happens

01:19:10.960 --> 01:19:11.960
every day.

01:19:11.960 --> 01:19:19.720
It also happens that this guy thought to do it this way, just for, I don't know, it

01:19:19.720 --> 01:19:23.640
just happened this way, and this is the guy that fell down this line.

01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:28.360
It's like they tried to make an example out of him.

01:19:28.360 --> 01:19:29.880
I don't know.

01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:32.880
I think there's so much more to come on this in the upcoming weeks.

01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:35.680
I feel like some of the gaps eventually will have to be filled in.

01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:37.360
This guy's going to talk at some point.

01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:41.880
It'll be very interesting to see what he has to say.

01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:49.320
Actually, someone did comment on the joystick story that they wrote on this thing, and apparently

01:19:49.320 --> 01:19:55.320
someone from inside GameSpot, and the guys actually said how the process went, and apparently

01:19:55.320 --> 01:19:59.280
the management in GameSpot changed, and now it's just a bunch of suits, and apparently

01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:01.880
this kind of thing is going to keep happening in GameSpot.

01:20:01.880 --> 01:20:06.360
Well, I don't know, but after this huge backlash, money rules everything, and if it's

01:20:06.360 --> 01:20:10.800
true that people are canceling their accounts not just by the hundreds, but by the thousands,

01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:15.140
then there are a board of directors that are over those suits, and those suits will be

01:20:15.140 --> 01:20:19.000
out very soon.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:20.000
Are you sure about that?

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.520
I mean, the thing is that suits are there for a reason.

01:20:22.520 --> 01:20:23.520
That's the reason why they bring them in.

01:20:23.520 --> 01:20:25.560
Money changes everything.

01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:26.740
Remember that old song?

01:20:26.740 --> 01:20:29.760
If it's true that people are canceling their accounts, and this is their...

01:20:29.760 --> 01:20:32.720
I mean, if it's like five people...

01:20:32.720 --> 01:20:36.440
Sometimes a lot of people threaten to do things, but they don't actually do it, but if it's

01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:41.880
true that people are canceling their accounts en masse, that money goes to pay these people's

01:20:41.880 --> 01:20:48.400
paychecks, and management will be the first thing to go if this company starts losing

01:20:48.400 --> 01:20:49.400
money and they have to lay off.

01:20:49.400 --> 01:20:51.000
I don't want to see GameSpot go under.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:55.400
I don't, but already they lost credibility, and not the editors.

01:20:55.400 --> 01:20:58.460
I mean, the editors themselves, if they go somewhere else, they're going to have their

01:20:58.460 --> 01:21:03.960
credibility back, but if they go, if they stay there like scaredy cats, and you will

01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:08.360
never know if their writing is their honest opinion or something that they're doing just

01:21:08.360 --> 01:21:09.360
because they don't want to lose their jobs.

01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:11.400
Well, I was going to say, they may not have a choice.

01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:13.360
They may have families and stuff.

01:21:13.360 --> 01:21:15.600
The job market's not that easy sometimes.

01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:20.920
Oh, I mean, trust me, I understand that, but the thing is we as gamers and as consumers

01:21:20.920 --> 01:21:23.000
who are about to spend whatever our money...

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:27.420
Okay, not me because I hired everything, but people who actually pay for stuff, they want

01:21:27.420 --> 01:21:32.040
to know what they're paying for, so it's not fair for them to buy crap because you don't

01:21:32.040 --> 01:21:37.520
know if they're lying to you when they're supposed to be telling you the objective truth.

01:21:37.520 --> 01:21:40.960
For some reason, there's a reason why it's journalism.

01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:47.820
It's a niche, but it's journalism, a kind of journalism, so they're supposed to be objective,

01:21:47.820 --> 01:21:54.240
and if money's in the way, I forgot who was it called that said that, but if money's in

01:21:54.240 --> 01:21:56.000
the way, then forget it.

01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:00.400
The whole thing gets screwed, and what we're looking at is everything's going to be game

01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:05.000
of the year material because we never know who's going to be paying for the paycheck

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:08.480
at the end of the month.

01:22:08.480 --> 01:22:11.120
One more thing, then we've got to wrap up and let you go.

01:22:11.120 --> 01:22:16.440
I'm looking here at Dr. 3ev, or whatever this guy's name is in chat.

01:22:16.440 --> 01:22:17.440
I can't pronounce his name.

01:22:17.440 --> 01:22:18.440
I'm sorry.

01:22:18.440 --> 01:22:23.400
It says, �Footy Monster takes payola for RPG reviews.� Are these accusations true?

01:22:23.400 --> 01:22:24.800
I wish they were.

01:22:24.800 --> 01:22:30.360
Trust me, the minute it happens, I'm buying myself out the receipt.

01:22:30.360 --> 01:22:31.680
I'm 60.

01:22:31.680 --> 01:22:33.160
Just know it.

01:22:33.160 --> 01:22:34.160
So far, no.

01:22:34.160 --> 01:22:37.200
About that, guys, you need to check out The Witcher.

01:22:37.200 --> 01:22:38.200
Such a good game.

01:22:38.200 --> 01:22:39.200
I'll tell you.

01:22:39.200 --> 01:22:40.200
What system is this on?

01:22:40.200 --> 01:22:41.200
PC only.

01:22:41.200 --> 01:22:42.200
What's PC?

01:22:42.200 --> 01:22:43.200
What?

01:22:43.200 --> 01:22:44.200
It's PC only?

01:22:44.200 --> 01:22:45.200
It's PC only.

01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:46.680
Yeah, but I don't have a great setup.

01:22:46.680 --> 01:22:51.220
I have a really crappy video card, like 60-buck video card, and it works acceptably good in

01:22:51.220 --> 01:22:53.880
medium detail, but it's such a fun game.

01:22:53.880 --> 01:22:55.880
I mean, obligatory plug.

01:22:55.880 --> 01:22:57.960
Check for the review on The Ultimate Quest.

01:22:57.960 --> 01:22:58.960
What's it called?

01:22:58.960 --> 01:22:59.960
The Witcher?

01:22:59.960 --> 01:23:00.960
Yeah.

01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:01.960
The Witcher.

01:23:01.960 --> 01:23:04.960
It's based on some Polish guy's books, and it's actually pretty good.

01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:05.960
You've heard of this, Loki?

01:23:05.960 --> 01:23:06.960
Yeah.

01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:07.960
It sounds like a scary game.

01:23:07.960 --> 01:23:08.960
I guess.

01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:09.960
Interesting.

01:23:09.960 --> 01:23:10.960
All right.

01:23:10.960 --> 01:23:11.960
I'll check it out, Footy.

01:23:11.960 --> 01:23:14.520
It's not a scary game at all, but it has sex, which is good.

01:23:14.520 --> 01:23:15.520
All right.

01:23:15.520 --> 01:23:16.520
Sex is great.

01:23:16.520 --> 01:23:17.520
I'm there.

01:23:17.520 --> 01:23:18.520
All right, Footy.

01:23:18.520 --> 01:23:19.520
We've got to let you go.

01:23:19.520 --> 01:23:20.520
Take care, buddy.

01:23:20.520 --> 01:23:21.520
All right.

01:23:21.520 --> 01:23:22.520
Take care, guys.

01:23:22.520 --> 01:23:23.520
Bye-bye.

01:23:23.520 --> 01:23:24.520
You too.

01:23:24.520 --> 01:23:25.520
Bye, Footy.

01:23:25.520 --> 01:23:26.520
Bye.

01:23:26.520 --> 01:23:28.280
I think this is going to do it for calls tonight, because we're looking at two long segments

01:23:28.280 --> 01:23:29.280
tonight.

01:23:29.280 --> 01:23:34.600
The short show last week has made this show very large this week, so we've got to go around

01:23:34.600 --> 01:23:38.440
and start getting everybody's final thoughts, but not before we get some last-minute stories.

01:23:38.440 --> 01:23:43.160
Loki, do you have any last-minute stories for us tonight, by chance?

01:23:43.160 --> 01:23:44.160
No.

01:23:44.160 --> 01:23:45.160
Wow.

01:23:45.160 --> 01:23:46.160
That's a first.

01:23:46.160 --> 01:23:47.160
It's a slow week.

01:23:47.160 --> 01:23:48.160
Yeah.

01:23:48.160 --> 01:23:52.160
Well, I mean, there's been a couple huge bombshells, like, of course, the GameSpot thing and everything

01:23:52.160 --> 01:23:56.160
and the Activision, if anything, but then, yeah, the rest of it's been kind of a quiet

01:23:56.160 --> 01:23:57.160
week.

01:23:57.160 --> 01:23:58.160
Oh.

01:23:58.160 --> 01:23:59.160
We'll be back for February.

01:23:59.160 --> 01:24:00.160
Oh.

01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:01.160
Really?

01:24:01.160 --> 01:24:08.520
PlayStation 3, 360 Wii, PlayStation 2, maybe, Karaoke Revolution, so.

01:24:08.520 --> 01:24:09.520
Mmm.

01:24:09.520 --> 01:24:10.520
Interesting.

01:24:10.520 --> 01:24:13.040
That's going to be very interesting, considering harmonics and Konami aren't in bed together

01:24:13.040 --> 01:24:14.040
anymore, are they?

01:24:14.040 --> 01:24:15.800
I don't know.

01:24:15.800 --> 01:24:16.800
I would like...

01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:17.800
They could still make it, though, without them.

01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:20.000
I would like to see American Idol on the 360, though.

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:23.160
That would be kind of fun, because I like the Karaoke Revolution series.

01:24:23.160 --> 01:24:24.160
Yeah.

01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:25.160
Very cool.

01:24:25.160 --> 01:24:26.160
I hope Universe 2 doesn't suck.

01:24:26.160 --> 01:24:27.160
I hope not either.

01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:28.160
I hope not either.

01:24:28.160 --> 01:24:29.160
We'll see.

01:24:29.160 --> 01:24:30.160
Yeah.

01:24:30.160 --> 01:24:34.280
Uh, Rice Princess, any last-minute stories from you?

01:24:34.280 --> 01:24:35.920
Have you been keeping tabs on the game industry?

01:24:35.920 --> 01:24:36.920
I just pooped.

01:24:36.920 --> 01:24:37.920
Yeah, great.

01:24:37.920 --> 01:24:38.920
That's great.

01:24:38.920 --> 01:24:39.920
Thank you very much.

01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:40.920
You're welcome.

01:24:40.920 --> 01:24:41.920
All right.

01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:42.920
Oh, yeah.

01:24:42.920 --> 01:24:43.920
Disney Channel.

01:24:43.920 --> 01:24:44.920
Next.

01:24:44.920 --> 01:24:45.920
When's that coming out?

01:24:45.920 --> 01:24:46.920
January.

01:24:46.920 --> 01:24:47.920
Oh.

01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:48.920
All right.

01:24:48.920 --> 01:24:49.920
If at all.

01:24:49.920 --> 01:24:50.920
It keeps getting delayed.

01:24:50.920 --> 01:24:51.920
All right.

01:24:51.920 --> 01:24:53.280
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

01:24:53.280 --> 01:24:56.320
Rice Princess, thanks so much for being here tonight, even if you didn't contribute much

01:24:56.320 --> 01:24:57.320
besides your poop jokes.

01:24:57.320 --> 01:24:58.660
No, I'm just kidding.

01:24:58.660 --> 01:25:00.560
We always appreciate having you here.

01:25:00.560 --> 01:25:01.560
Thank you.

01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:02.560
You're welcome.

01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:04.560
Any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

01:25:04.560 --> 01:25:05.560
No.

01:25:05.560 --> 01:25:06.560
Okay.

01:25:06.560 --> 01:25:07.560
No.

01:25:07.560 --> 01:25:09.040
You contribute so much to this program.

01:25:09.040 --> 01:25:10.040
I appreciate it.

01:25:10.040 --> 01:25:11.040
Thanks.

01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:13.200
Loki, any final thoughts from you?

01:25:13.200 --> 01:25:14.920
I just have a lot of games to play this week.

01:25:14.920 --> 01:25:17.800
Probably won't get to most of them.

01:25:17.800 --> 01:25:23.680
My final thought is I need to charge my iPod so I can listen to lots of podcasts tomorrow

01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:27.680
at work because I'm writing tomorrow so I want to be able to listen to podcasts and

01:25:27.680 --> 01:25:28.680
music.

01:25:28.680 --> 01:25:29.680
Good idea.

01:25:29.680 --> 01:25:31.240
That sounds good to me.

01:25:31.240 --> 01:25:32.240
All right.

01:25:32.240 --> 01:25:35.240
I need a new job.

01:25:35.240 --> 01:25:37.440
I hope your employers don't listen to this program.

01:25:37.440 --> 01:25:38.440
They do.

01:25:38.440 --> 01:25:39.440
Whatever.

01:25:39.440 --> 01:25:42.960
I don't think my manager knows how to operate a podcast anyways, to be honest.

01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:45.880
I know I have coworkers who listen to this show sometimes.

01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:46.880
They like it.

01:25:46.880 --> 01:25:49.920
No, but seriously though, I mean, I need a new job.

01:25:49.920 --> 01:25:51.280
This doesn't pay enough.

01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:54.880
The problem is though in the area that we're at, like since we don't live in the Bay Area,

01:25:54.880 --> 01:25:57.200
you know, there's not like game companies all over Sacramento.

01:25:57.200 --> 01:25:59.400
The Bay Area is a highly competitive job market too.

01:25:59.400 --> 01:26:00.400
Yeah.

01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:02.120
Hey, I hear there's a couple job openings at GameSpot.

01:26:02.120 --> 01:26:05.400
That's in the Bay Area though, see?

01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:06.400
I don't want to be an editor.

01:26:06.400 --> 01:26:07.400
You could take the train over there.

01:26:07.400 --> 01:26:08.400
I can't write.

01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:09.720
You could take the train.

01:26:09.720 --> 01:26:10.720
I can hardly see.

01:26:10.720 --> 01:26:12.920
Can you imagine Loki's game reviews on GameSpot?

01:26:12.920 --> 01:26:14.960
Oh my God, this game sucks.

01:26:14.960 --> 01:26:16.160
There wasn't enough boobs.

01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:17.160
No.

01:26:17.160 --> 01:26:23.440
I would be objective, but you know, I just honestly, when we're talking about games during

01:26:23.440 --> 01:26:27.560
our game of the week and stuff like that, I can't go into an in-depth review about stuff

01:26:27.560 --> 01:26:33.800
because honestly, I don't play a lot of stuff and I don't have the free time to like review

01:26:33.800 --> 01:26:35.400
a game every week or something like that.

01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:37.960
I don't have enough time to play anything.

01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:40.080
You barely have enough time to do this damn show.

01:26:40.080 --> 01:26:41.080
I do.

01:26:41.080 --> 01:26:46.200
I barely have enough time to do this damn show, but no, I don't know.

01:26:46.200 --> 01:26:52.080
I would love to do a review show and one of the things I'm planning on doing with my money

01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:59.080
they get for my bonus is building a new computer and going to have a nice new video card that's

01:26:59.080 --> 01:27:03.440
going to hopefully have something that I can import component video to so I can do stuff

01:27:03.440 --> 01:27:05.280
like that, video editing and stuff.

01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:06.280
Nice.

01:27:06.280 --> 01:27:10.600
I just have to have the time to do all that stuff too because, you know.

01:27:10.600 --> 01:27:11.600
Alright.

01:27:11.600 --> 01:27:17.200
Well, anyhow, I guess we'll see what the future holds in 2008 for Loki and, you know, all

01:27:17.200 --> 01:27:19.080
the rest of us here at Orange Launch Radio.

01:27:19.080 --> 01:27:23.320
Meantime, thank you guys so much for downloading and supporting independent podcasting by listening

01:27:23.320 --> 01:27:24.320
to Orange Launch Radio.

01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:25.320
We really appreciate it.

01:27:25.320 --> 01:27:29.220
If you like what you heard, please tell two friends about our station because then when

01:27:29.220 --> 01:27:34.440
everybody tells two people, slowly we take over the world and if you don't have any friends,

01:27:34.440 --> 01:27:38.680
I'm sorry to hear that first of all, you can make some friends on our forums at orangelaunchradio.com,

01:27:38.680 --> 01:27:41.800
but you can also leave us a review on iTunes.

01:27:41.800 --> 01:27:45.040
That would be fair as well because we need some more five star reviews on iTunes.

01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:46.600
We haven't gotten any in a while.

01:27:46.600 --> 01:27:47.600
It kind of makes me sad.

01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:48.600
Aww.

01:27:48.600 --> 01:27:49.600
Yeah.

01:27:49.600 --> 01:27:50.600
Make me happy.

01:27:50.600 --> 01:27:51.600
Leave some more five star reviews this week.

01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:52.600
That's it guys.

01:27:52.600 --> 01:27:53.600
Thank you so much for tuning in.

01:27:53.600 --> 01:27:54.600
Have a great week.

01:27:54.600 --> 01:27:55.600
