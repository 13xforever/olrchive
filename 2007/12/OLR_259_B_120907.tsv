0	5800	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.
5800	11800	To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com
11800	15300	for links to websites with listings of past episodes.
15300	19800	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
19800	23600	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio. We are live on this Sunday evening,
23600	27400	and I just want to remind you guys, you know, there are some more perks that you get when listening live.
27400	31500	You know, we try to deliver a quality show to those of you guys who listen on the podcast,
31500	35300	vlogcast, Zooncast, whatever the hell you call it, whatever you're listening to right now.
35300	41000	But there's more perks when you listen live. We do tape on Sunday nights live at 6 o'clock Pacific time.
41000	43800	All the details are on our website, www.orangeloungeradio.com.
43800	47700	We have a live 365 stream and a video stream through Operator 11,
47700	51900	and we were just showing off a new game on the Wii called No More Heroes during the bonus segment.
51900	55700	So those are the kind of perks you get only when you listen live.
55700	59500	But we still try to show a lot of love to those of you guys who listen to us on the podcast,
59500	62500	because we realize not everybody can be here Sunday night.
62500	65700	But you can try. You should try, at least once. See what it's like.
65700	69700	All right, let's get back into the gaming news then, since we're already in the second half of the show.
71500	76500	All right. Anyways, let's see here.
76500	83500	Super Smash Bros. coming out over here, you know, obviously it was delayed a little bit.
83500	86900	Previously it was supposed to be out this year, now it's February.
86900	91700	Not so for Europe, at least. You're going to have to wait a little bit longer.
91700	96300	And they haven't really said exactly when, but it's going to be Quarter 2 of next year.
96300	100900	So, you know, I don't know. That's not good, I guess.
100900	103500	But at least you're not waiting until Christmas of next year.
103500	107700	But aren't the Brits kind of used to getting screwed like this in a way, you know?
107700	116300	Maybe. But here's the thing, though. I don't really see what they... I mean, other than changing the screen resolution stuff that it renders at,
116300	119300	you're not really localizing it for Europe, so...
119300	124900	That's what I want to know. Like, are they having to, you know, produce extra copies and that takes so freaking long?
124900	127900	Or what is it? What causes things to be so slow? I don't get it.
127900	130300	I guess it's just, you know, changing some of the programming.
130300	134900	Because, I mean, if you think about it, a lot of the games that they get in Europe we don't get over here for a while, so...
135900	137100	Yeah, that kind of sucks.
137100	139700	MacMan says Europe, the shaft of the gaming world.
139700	143100	You know, I know we have quite a few people over there to listen. I'm sure aren't happy about this.
143100	145100	They've already gotten some games we haven't had over here yet.
145100	150100	Like, they have Endless Ocean already, which, you know, I'm sure given the opportunity they would say,
150100	152100	Fuck Endless Ocean, let's get Super Smash Brothers.
152100	157700	But, you know, they do get a few games before we do, so... I don't know.
157700	163100	RossDlut in chat says, Loki, menus and stuff need to be made in other languages. Any announcer?
163100	172100	Well, true. But, I mean, still, though, you know, for, like, some of the territories, they can release it in English-speaking territories or stuff like that.
172100	180500	And, also, a lot of the games, like, you know, Excite Truck and that kind of thing, when they were putting them out, they develop them for, like, usually it's English, Spanish, and French, I think.
180500	185500	Especially, all the Nintendo titles seem to be English, Spanish, and French even when they come out over here.
185500	186000	Yeah.
186000	191500	Because, you know, Canada and Mexico, you need French for Canada and Spanish for Mexico, so, you know, it's kind of like a region.
191500	194900	I wouldn't think that that would, I mean, hold them back, really, too much.
196900	203900	Alright, well, sorry Europe, it looks like you're going to get screwed there, but, you know, we'll tell you how fun it is.
203900	205300	No, I'm just kidding, that's so mean.
205300	216900	Alright, one, I guess, interesting kind of piece of news is that Nintendo is kind of, in a way, fessed up that they're not able to meet the needs of the Wii demand that's out there.
216900	223900	You know how the Wii seems to be, once again, for the second year in a row, the hot holiday toy that everybody's dying to get.
223900	233300	Nintendo has decided to pull ads for its Wii console, and this actually, this story is out of the UK, actually, although I do believe it affects everybody,
233300	241300	that Nintendo's actually going to be redistributing the commercials that they had scheduled up until Christmas through the first quarter of 2008.
241300	249900	A Nintendo spokesman said, quote, we have been running the campaign all year round, but we want to take a responsible stance this Christmas and not fuel demand.
249900	253900	An ad industry insider said, quote, you can tell what's been happening.
253900	259900	They have a lot of spots on TV, but I'm seeing more ads for the DS than I am for the Wii, so you can draw your own conclusions.
259900	264300	So maybe that some of these ads got shifted to Nintendo DS ads, who knows.
264300	271300	Production has been stepped up to 1.8 million units a month, and Nintendo still cannot meet the demand.
271300	277300	According to RasteelUT in chat, it says eBay vultures are the only people buying the systems.
277300	281300	Sad but true, there probably are quite a few of those folks buying it.
281300	284300	RasteelUT also says software sales are still pathetic.
284300	286300	You know why? I have a theory. Why?
286300	290300	Because most people that are buying that system are perfectly content with Wii Sports.
290300	293300	A lot of people are buying this just for Wii Sports.
293300	299300	Especially when you start to look at the older crowd and the more casual gamers.
299300	305300	That's the enabling game for the Nintendo Wii, and when it comes with the system, people don't think they need anything else.
305300	312300	I mean, back in the day when we were buying 8-bit Nintendo systems with Super Mario Brothers and Duck Hunt, did we buy another game to go with it?
312300	316300	Not necessarily, not always. Many kids found just that pack under their tree for Christmas.
316300	318300	You know what I mean?
318300	326300	Granted, I would also humor probably the implied statement there that there's not a lot of must-have software on the Wii right now outside of the Wii like Mario Galaxy.
326300	333300	Well, there's a lot of good games out there, but there's a lot more really crappy games, and it's really hard to tell.
333300	338300	But at the same time, those really crappy games kind of cater to the 7 and 8 year olds, you know what I mean?
338300	341300	Like all the movie tie-in games, like Happy Feet and stuff.
341300	347300	That ties into the child audience, that there are a lot of kids out there getting Wiis.
347300	348300	Yeah.
348300	359300	Anyhow, that's good, though, that Nintendo at least is not going to be making it even worse by continuing to advertise it on TV and reminding people who may not have thought to run out and get one otherwise.
359300	365300	So if you still haven't gotten a Wii for whatever reason, maybe it'll be a little bit easier?
365300	366300	Little bit?
366300	370300	But probably not. You probably want to get online in the stock inventory.
370300	373300	Well, some of us waited in line.
373300	379300	That's true. I bet all the Nintendo fanboys and fangirls waited in line day one anyway, and they're just looking at this and laughing.
379300	382300	Some of us just didn't care to buy a Wii.
382300	385300	That's true, and some people are like, eh, fuck Wii.
385300	389300	Oh, I should tell you, my mom told me she wanted a Wii.
389300	399300	You know, you're not the first person to tell me that story, which is, I'm just kind of saying like, you know, I'm hearing a lot of people, their parents are wanting Wiis and getting into that, but it's the sports game.
399300	403300	I know a parent that wants it for Wii bowling because she likes to bowl.
403300	408300	I thought it was funny because my mom almost played my old Nintendo more than I did.
408300	412300	And, you know, actually she probably played it as much as I did.
412300	419300	She wouldn't admit to it, but my mom was a gamer once, and she had her Game Boy and played lots of Breakout.
419300	425300	But, you know, now hearing my mom say, I want a Wii, can you get me a Wii?
425300	429300	I was like, I don't have $300, but we'll see.
429300	432300	Pika Uno has a very interesting perspective.
432300	437300	He's one of our listeners that lives over in Japan, and he says, I just bought one for my friend in the UK.
437300	441300	There are plenty of Wiis in Japan.
441300	442300	So, kind of interesting.
442300	447300	I wonder what effect that's going to have, though, if you bought one for your friend in the UK, because aren't the TVs different?
447300	449300	Yeah, Japan's NTSC.
449300	451300	I'm sure there's some converter.
451300	455300	Well, I mean, if you have an HDTV, it's moot anyway.
455300	464300	But for our friends in the UK, speaking of which, there is a couple of things that are out on the Virtual Console now.
464300	469300	We have Light Crusader, which is one of Treasure's games.
469300	471300	I love Treasure.
471300	474300	Treasure gave us Silhouette Mirage.
474300	480300	But this was one of their Mega Drive releases, which over here was the Genesis.
480300	487300	And it's also coming out with, I do believe, Rolling Thunder 2.
487300	497300	And also coming out is Cybernator, which was called Assault Suits Vulcan in Japan.
497300	502300	Pika Uno wanted to clarify something, speaking of the whole UK and how he's sending one to his friend.
502300	511300	He said modern PAL TVs are NTSC-compatible, which I guess that explains that. That's kind of cool.
511300	522300	But he says 99% of NTSC TVs are not PAL-compatible, which he discovered when he went over to Japan from London, where he was originally at.
522300	526300	Isn't High Def supposed to be all the same no matter where you are?
526300	527300	It is.
527300	529300	Then we need to get on that quick.
529300	533300	Because these whole differing TV formats make things very frustrating.
533300	542300	Well, just for example, when I was really big into my Gorillaz fandom, I was importing some of the DVD CDs.
542300	546300	And I would just run it through my laptop to the TV and no problem.
546300	549300	Yeah, so there you go.
549300	559300	Anyways, let's see here. So for the US, you've got some good stuff coming out on the Virtual Console.
559300	566300	Including, we talked about it last week, Pokemon Snap. That's going to be coming out.
566300	569300	Baseball Stars 2 for the Neo Geo.
569300	574300	And also Ghosts and Goblins. That was on the NES.
574300	581300	Hooray for Pokemon Snap! I can't wait to download this and play this and send all of you pictures of Pokemon I take.
581300	587300	Which means you, and you, and are you on my Wiilet? You don't have a Wii. Well then screw you.
587300	591300	I'm going to definitely actually give that a download, but I won't say I'll be downloading Ghosts and Goblins.
591300	597300	Because we actually broke out our Saturn for our annual tradition and Dan was playing Capcom Collection Volume 2.
597300	598300	Nice.
598300	599300	The game is too damn hard.
599300	601300	It is too damn hard.
601300	602300	I will not be downloading it.
602300	607300	Because guess what? You play all the way through it and guess what? You have to play all the way through it again to beat the game.
607300	610300	And then what do you get? Congratulations, the story is happy end.
610300	612300	You beat, you kicked Satan's butt.
612300	617300	Well anyway, I will definitely check out Pokemon Snap, so I'm excited about that.
617300	620300	This is something I'm kind of curious to check out as well.
620300	627300	A Ninja Party game is coming to the Nintendo Wii and the Nintendo DS in March of next year.
627300	629300	Ninja Reflex is the name of the game.
629300	636300	It's being published by EA, but also a company called Nunchuck Games.
636300	637300	How appropriate.
637300	642300	It's being developed by Sanzaru Games, which is a brand new studio in California.
642300	645300	It's seven former Activision developers.
645300	648300	And what a great first game to be putting out.
648300	650300	A game all about ninjas.
650300	662300	EA notes that Ninja Reflexes will center around doing challenges and testing your reaction time, which is very appropriate for a ninja game.
662300	664300	Here's a quote.
664300	666300	Millisecond precision.
666300	668300	Sounds like fun.
668300	670300	We'll see.
670300	673300	I hope you can calibrate it or something to give it that extra precision.
673300	674300	We'll see.
674300	677300	That just sounds sort of nifty cool.
677300	679300	We'll see.
679300	681300	I'll check it out.
681300	687300	This is fairly, fairly interesting stuff for anyone who has a Wii.
687300	702300	If you join Club Nintendo and you would use your previous Nintendo website login, you can buy Wii points for four stars for every Wii point using your old stars from the Nintendo Club.
702300	705300	And this is actually nintendo-europe.com.
705300	708300	I don't know if they're doing anything like that in the U.S.
708300	709300	I wish.
709300	715300	But it was a loyalty program that they had going on where if you did stuff you had all these stars.
715300	721300	So you can go through and use your points to buy games or go shopping or do stuffs.
721300	724300	It's kind of nice that you can finally get something for it, you know?
724300	726300	Yeah, I think it's pretty cool.
726300	732300	As for all those people who saved up your stars, congrats to you.
732300	735300	Anyways, let's see here.
735300	737300	This is also kind of interesting.
737300	751300	Usually you would think Gamefly with rentals for games and stuff, but now they're offering Gamefly Tunes, which is a partnership with a company called Brand Racket.
751300	757300	And they're offering the subscribers five free preselected songs to download each month.
757300	768300	And I guess it's going to highlight up and coming and established artists, and apparently people that aren't subscribed to the service can download one.
768300	779300	And I guess this month, music including artists like RJD2, Thievery Corporation, Shadows Fall, OK Go, and Little Brother.
779300	783300	That's interesting that they would be doing that kind of stuff.
783300	787300	And as far as I'm aware, I don't think that's actually any video game music, so...
787300	794300	Yeah, I actually downloaded some of those songs, and I mean, they are up and coming artists, so they aren't really...
794300	798300	Some of them are OK, others aren't that great.
798300	803300	And I imagine that probably every month it's going to be more of the same.
803300	808300	Well, I mean, OK Go, they're in Rock Band, but I don't know.
808300	810300	Free's good, I guess.
810300	816300	I already have both of OK Go's other albums, and the rest of their stuff just sounds the same.
816300	819300	Just less entertaining.
819300	821300	Kind of boring in some cases.
821300	825300	I don't listen to a lot of the stuff that you kids are listening to these days.
825300	829300	You and your old radio discs.
829300	831300	80s forever!
831300	834300	8-track tapes.
834300	837300	Well, anyway, that's cassette tapes.
837300	844300	Let's move on to talking about something that could be all the rage in a couple of years, or very soon, who knows.
844300	850300	Apparently a patent was filed by Apple back in September of 2006.
850300	855300	And now it has just come out to light, because I guess these things take a while to hit the public internet.
855300	860300	Apparently, there is going to be multi-touch technology in this game.
860300	863300	So, apparently, what it is, basically...
863300	870300	I mean, obviously, they already have the iPhone, but they want to apply this touch technology, the multi-touch thing, to gaming.
870300	875300	So, they say, quote, this is being used for a game or a gaming application.
875300	883300	And, of course, we all know about the iPhone, but now we're kind of talking about that possibly this patent was actually filed to do gaming on the iPhone.
883300	886300	Possibly a music-based game.
886300	892300	But, I mean, this really doesn't come as much as a surprise, because on the current iPods, they've gone into gaming a little bit.
892300	897300	So, it just makes sense to me that on the iPhones and the iTouches and all this stuff, they're going to get into this as well.
897300	902300	Yes, and remember how wonderful those games are on the iPods already.
902300	906300	I'm being sarcastic, by the way, because they're not very good.
906300	910300	Well, what about the one that came out from Harmonix?
910300	911300	Faze.
911300	912300	Thank you.
912300	915300	Faze was okay, but, seriously, the rest of them sucked.
915300	917300	I mean, I don't know.
917300	926300	But then again, I mean, there's not much you can do with just a jog wheel, so, you know, having multiple touch screen stuff on there, yeah, that would be a lot better, obviously.
926300	934300	But, I wouldn't, I don't know, you're going to get as much gaming out of this as you are an N-Gage, so, seriously.
934300	939300	Well, I guess time will tell, but it is very interesting that that came up, nevertheless.
939300	944300	Always interesting are the emails that you guys send us every week at Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
944300	952300	And every week, Jamie dives in head first into our big old mailbag and pulls out a few of the emails that she likes and reads them for us here, live on air.
952300	955300	And that's what she's going to do right now in our mailbag segment.
955300	966300	Email, email, email.
966300	976300	And just as a point of order, I will say that I have read every email that comes through, and some are not being read, you know, on air, because we got a bunch of them.
976300	978300	So, I will read a few of these.
978300	983300	And one of them was sent from an iPhone, and that makes me laugh.
983300	988300	This is from jazz432 slash ps3.
988300	990300	Okay.
990300	992300	Anyway, hey, guys, I love the show.
992300	995300	You guys keep me going on the podcast at work.
995300	999300	I just wanted to say that I found a new game for me.
999300	1005300	I know you guys are not very big on the PS3, but you need to give it time and a chance.
1005300	1009300	I was on the PSN store last night and saw that they had added some new games.
1009300	1011300	I had never heard of a game called Wild Arms.
1011300	1013300	Have you never heard of Wild Arms?
1013300	1017300	I know you guys slash ladies may have.
1017300	1020300	It's a good RPG for the PSP.
1020300	1022300	Well, it was a PlayStation game.
1022300	1027300	Way better on PlayStation LOL anyway.
1027300	1030300	I heard on your last podcast that you don't get reviewed much on iTunes.
1030300	1032300	I will give you a good score when I get home from work.
1032300	1033300	I love the show and keep it up.
1033300	1035300	Jamie, I love your input on the show.
1035300	1039300	It's always good to get info from the ladies and not from just us geek guys.
1039300	1044300	Got to go back to work before the boss finds out I am emailing you guys, LOLJK.
1044300	1046300	I'm telling.
1046300	1050300	Actually, I just sold my copy of Ratchet and Clank Tools of Destruction.
1050300	1057300	It's just not the full Ratchet and Clank, it's just I don't like the Ratchet and Clank series.
1057300	1063300	That game is probably pretty good, but the person I sold it to loves it a lot more than I do.
1063300	1068300	There's a lot of games though for the PS3.
1068300	1074300	I was going to give Unreal Tournament 3 a chance, but for some reason,
1074300	1078300	part of me thought that there was an actual good single player portion of that game,
1078300	1084300	but it's Unreal Tournament and there's not, so I don't really want to buy it.
1084300	1087300	I don't know, there will be more stuff that comes out later on.
1087300	1091300	It's just right now, there's not a lot of great games for it.
1091300	1093300	Not to say that there won't ever be.
1093300	1095300	Some interesting comments on chat on Wild Arms.
1095300	1097300	It's kind of polarizing the chat room.
1097300	1098300	Separat1215 said,
1098300	1100300	Wild Arms was never a huge game.
1100300	1102300	I'm not surprised if no one knows what it is.
1102300	1103300	RossDeelUT says,
1103300	1106300	How the fuck has this guy never heard of Wild Arms?
1106300	1107300	Jonathan F. says,
1107300	1111300	Wild Arms is a killer RPG held up well against Final Fantasy VII,
1111300	1112300	I think in my opinion.
1112300	1115300	Wild Arms is just as it sounds, a Wild West RPG,
1115300	1118300	although it's not that at the same time.
1118300	1122300	So, I already have some comments on Wild Arms from the chat.
1122300	1123300	Any more emails?
1123300	1125300	No, none at all.
1125300	1126300	Yeah, there's some.
1126300	1127300	All right.
1127300	1128300	Next email,
1128300	1129300	Hey folks at OLR.
1129300	1132300	I was just emailing to say that I was just about in tears at work
1132300	1136300	from laughing so hard at Loki flipping out about one up protesting for publicity.
1136300	1142300	I'm glad someone gets fired up about something and Loki offered up some radio gold.
1142300	1145300	You guys host a fantastic show and I always look forward to listening.
1145300	1148300	Keep putting out fantastic shows and us fans will be extremely saddened
1148300	1151300	with the loss of this show because it really kicks the crap out of those
1151300	1156300	other big name corporate podcasts with its real enthusiasm and passion.
1156300	1158300	Ego++, thank you.
1158300	1160300	And again, this email is sponsored by the Olive Garden,
1160300	1162300	home of the Never Ending South.
1162300	1163300	It's J-Rod.
1163300	1165300	Dude, the Olive Garden is awesome.
1165300	1166300	Next,
1166300	1167300	Dear OLR,
1167300	1168300	I was thinking,
1168300	1172300	would those jot guys act the same way if it said gay girl?
1172300	1176300	Oh, you missed the video last week.
1176300	1179300	Somebody did this experiment where they went on the internet with Halo 3
1179300	1183300	and their gamer tag was gay boy and they went into all these rooms
1183300	1185300	and you can just imagine, I mean,
1185300	1188300	Xbox Live, you can probably fill in the blanks with what happened.
1188300	1192300	So, this is probably what this person is responding to is what would happen
1192300	1195300	if this person went in the room with the name gay girl.
1195300	1197300	Because when two girls make out, that's hot.
1197300	1200300	But when two guys make out, that's gross.
1200300	1204300	Dude, I think that guys making out is really hot.
1204300	1207300	Anyway, they probably wouldn't.
1207300	1209300	It's a sad truth of the world we live in.
1209300	1212300	There's people who only like one part of something but not the other part.
1212300	1215300	I'm just waiting until gaming is blamed for bigotry.
1215300	1217300	Siaion671.
1217300	1219300	PS, Sky already has the game.
1219300	1221300	Sky's voice is a little different.
1221300	1224300	Sky has the game. Sky's voice is the game.
1224300	1226300	Don't get me started.
1226300	1228300	But good point brought up.
1228300	1230300	I would like to see an experiment done.
1230300	1233300	I would like to see the same person go back on the Halo 3 with the name
1233300	1236300	gay girl or lesbian girl or something like that.
1236300	1240300	Because you say gay girl and a lot of folks get the stereotypical
1240300	1244300	butchy girl who likes girls in their mind.
1244300	1247300	But lesbians is a more exotic word.
1247300	1253300	Lesbians is the lipstick wherein pillow fighting lesbians.
1253300	1255300	Porn star.
1255300	1259300	When I would tell you that most lesbians I know are in neither category.
1259300	1262300	Yeah.
1262300	1265300	So continuing forward, shall I?
1265300	1266300	You shall.
1266300	1267300	Greetings.
1267300	1271300	This is Kripatkin from the Kripatkin and Hendricks Game Review Show.
1271300	1273300	Sorry, I'm being tongue tied.
1273300	1275300	While listening to your show last week, second part,
1275300	1277300	I noticed that Loki casually dismissed Sensible Soccer
1277300	1279300	as of little to no interest to anyone
1279300	1281300	and then Sky and Rice Princess began to laugh at its name.
1281300	1283300	Oh dear.
1283300	1285300	I had to count to ten before writing this email
1285300	1287300	as one should never write an email in anger for yes,
1287300	1291300	such a dismissive attitude filled me with both fury and despair.
1291300	1294300	Sensible World of Soccer, a.k.a. Sensei,
1294300	1296300	is part of the holy trinity of British video game titles
1296300	1298300	that cannot be slighted.
1298300	1302300	It was an all-time classic footy game made by Sensible Software,
1302300	1307300	hence the name, that built on Kickoff 2 title from back in 1989
1307300	1309300	on the Atari ST and Amiga.
1309300	1313300	To see it arrive on Xbox Live Arcade is nothing short of wondrous news.
1313300	1315300	To put it into perspective, try to imagine someone saying
1315300	1317300	Super Mario 3 is a bit meh
1317300	1322300	and that is what you did last week as far as your British listenership were concerned.
1322300	1325300	Oh, and in case you're wondering what other two games are in the trinity there,
1325300	1329300	Speedball 2, already on Xbox Live Arcade, and Paragoid.
1329300	1332300	If you want to know more about these three games, search on Wiki.
1332300	1334300	It has some great pages for all three games.
1334300	1336300	I've actually heard of Paragoid.
1336300	1339300	Keep up the good work and just be careful over games
1339300	1341300	that originate from the British Isles in the future.
1341300	1343300	I mean, you might even start saying things like
1343300	1345300	Lords of Midnight are a bit overrated.
1345300	1346300	Not a good idea.
1346300	1349300	So basically what Karpatkin's trying to tell us is that
1349300	1354300	Guardian Legend is to Orange Lounge Radio
1354300	1358300	as Sensible World of Soccer is to all of the UK.
1358300	1361300	Is that kind of what this email is to summarize?
1361300	1363300	That's the general...
1363300	1366300	I see. Well, we are sorry for poking fun at your sacred game.
1366300	1368300	Or he was just saying Loki was wrong.
1368300	1370300	Which a lot of our emailers like to do.
1370300	1373300	Dude, okay, no offense, but I mean...
1373300	1374300	Uh-oh.
1374300	1375300	You know, even...
1375300	1380300	Okay, I'll give you, you know, yeah, Super Mario World 3 may be not the shit.
1380300	1383300	And to be honest, it was the shit at one time,
1383300	1386300	but times have changed, okay?
1386300	1389300	Sensible World of Soccer may have been a great game at the time,
1389300	1391300	and it still may be a great game now.
1391300	1393300	But you know what, though?
1393300	1395300	I ain't gonna download it.
1395300	1396300	You know why I'm not gonna download it?
1396300	1398300	Because it's a soccer game, for one.
1398300	1402300	I don't play sports games, and I definitely don't play soccer games.
1402300	1405300	And two, it's like an Amiga game.
1405300	1407300	I'll check out the demo, and if I like it, I'll buy it.
1407300	1409300	That's what I do with most games.
1409300	1411300	I'll be sensible about it.
1411300	1415300	Back in the day, I used to play Blades of Steel and stuff like that,
1415300	1417300	so I have tried games and stuff like that.
1417300	1419300	It's just not my thing.
1419300	1421300	And I'm not saying that you're wrong for downloading it.
1421300	1423300	I'm not faulting you for doing that, but you know what?
1423300	1425300	I sure as hell am not downloading it.
1425300	1428300	But you're wrong for being British, is what we're trying to say.
1428300	1429300	I'm not British.
1429300	1431300	I'm just kidding. Never mind.
1431300	1432300	Rob.
1432300	1433300	What?
1433300	1437300	You remember, though, what I went crazy about finding at the store Friday night?
1437300	1444300	Super High Impact, which is the only American football game that I like, ever.
1444300	1447300	I like Tecmo Bowl on the Nintendo.
1447300	1448300	That's my favorite.
1448300	1450300	Super High Impact on Super Nintendo, I think.
1450300	1452300	But I also played...
1452300	1455300	What was it that was on Super Nintendo? Was it Mario Stryker?
1455300	1457300	Wasn't that it?
1457300	1458300	No, Mario Stryker's a new one, isn't it?
1458300	1459300	No, that's the new one.
1459300	1461300	Oh, that's probably like a new sequel or something.
1461300	1464300	It was an old one on Super Nintendo, another soccer game.
1464300	1466300	I used to play that all the time.
1466300	1468300	Uh-oh, the chat room's requesting my British accent.
1468300	1469300	No.
1469300	1470300	You better go to next email.
1470300	1472300	No, next email.
1472300	1476300	Oh, I think I'll be logging on to Xbox Live this week and downloading some sensible World
1476300	1477300	of Soccer.
1477300	1478300	Sensible.
1478300	1479300	Cheerio.
1479300	1480300	Or Scottish.
1480300	1483300	Okay, see, I'm not doing that shit, so I mean, come on.
1483300	1485300	And they're getting mad at me.
1485300	1486300	Whatever.
1486300	1487300	Yeah, but I'm cute.
1487300	1488300	Uh-huh.
1488300	1489300	Yeah.
1489300	1490300	Hey, OLR.
1490300	1495300	I've been listening to your show for over a year now, and I think it's the best.
1495300	1496300	Aww.
1496300	1499300	My question is mainly for Loki, but others could chime in.
1499300	1500300	Well, thank you for your permission.
1500300	1504300	I bought a PSP slim and need to know how to install custom firmwares.
1504300	1509300	Do I need Pandora's battery and how to?
1509300	1514300	Um, your show is awesome, great, and with a PSP, I will hopefully be listening live
1514300	1515300	more often.
1515300	1516300	Thanks, Ryan.
1516300	1523300	Yeah, you do need Pandora's battery in order to install custom firmware on there, and there's
1523300	1527300	instructions online on how to do it, and you actually have to create a different Pandora's
1527300	1532300	battery than the one that they use for the fat PSPs, but basically it involves you making
1532300	1538300	the standard Pandora's battery, then you patch the file with some other thing, and then once
1538300	1543300	you've done that, you run the Pandora's battery on the system, and then you can install custom
1543300	1544300	firmwares.
1544300	1549300	Don't ask me how to do it, because I didn't know at the time, I had to read a very, you
1549300	1553300	know, stupid walkthrough on how to do it, and it took me about three times before I
1553300	1554300	finally got it right.
1554300	1558300	So, it's not easy, but it's not super difficult.
1558300	1560300	Do you have to mod your PSP?
1560300	1562300	I mean, Jesus, just play the games.
1562300	1564300	Me, I don't!
1564300	1567300	Hey, I have to mod everything.
1567300	1568300	Everything!
1568300	1572300	There is not anything that I don't break open.
1572300	1574300	Except for my DS, I haven't done that yet.
1574300	1577300	I'm working on it right now, though.
1577300	1582300	We broke open my old Game Boy Advance to put an afterburner in it.
1582300	1585300	That's different, because it really needed that.
1585300	1587300	I mean, that really enhanced the damn Game Boy Advance.
1587300	1590300	My friend did that for me for my birthday, but I'm just saying, you know, the PSP, yeah,
1590300	1595300	I installed, when they were first out, I installed the stuff that let me play Kid Icarus on the
1595300	1599300	PSP so I could go, hee, hee, hee, I have Kid Icarus everywhere, but now it's kind of old.
1599300	1600300	And so, I just, I don't care anymore.
1600300	1601300	I don't care about modding anymore.
1601300	1604300	I haven't hacked my iPhone, though, and I'm not going to.
1604300	1607300	Not my thing.
1607300	1608300	Next email.
1608300	1611300	DMN says, Loki modded his penis.
1611300	1612300	Exactly.
1612300	1615300	Because you did say you have to mod everything.
1615300	1618300	Game consoles, okay.
1618300	1623300	Yes, please, next email, quick.
1623300	1625300	Next email says words.
1625300	1627300	Hey, Loki, Dark Soccer, and Sky.
1627300	1630300	I just wanted to thank you guys so much for helping me get through a really hard first
1630300	1632300	semester at college.
1632300	1636300	Looking forward to the next podcast kept me going and helped me look around for some fellow
1636300	1640300	gamers that need play, so I quickly found a whole bunch of Wii players, and I've been
1640300	1644300	having fun with Mario Strikers since I'm one of those more social gamers, although I don't
1644300	1645300	play online a lot.
1645300	1648900	Anyway, keep up the good work, and once again, thanks for making this transition all that
1648900	1651340	much more manageable.
1651340	1652660	All the best, Cliff R.
1652660	1654660	Wow, lots of good ego emails tonight.
1654660	1658620	No, but I'm glad to hear about the Wii Club that's forming at your campus.
1658620	1659620	That's kind of fun.
1659620	1661500	That's pretty cool.
1661500	1662500	Last email.
1662500	1665820	Remember when we were going to do a show live at a college campus?
1665820	1667060	We actually, no, we were having talks.
1667060	1668060	Remember that?
1668060	1669740	We were going to do that at East Davis.
1669740	1673340	We were going to be doing it in their big theater they had there, but it didn't work
1673340	1679220	out because our hookup left, and we no longer had a hookup to do our show there.
1679220	1680620	We were going to do one of our big shows there.
1680620	1684660	I don't remember if it was 150 or 200, but oh well.
1684660	1686180	Maybe we should have a contest.
1686180	1687580	OLR comes to your school.
1687580	1688580	Apparently.
1688580	1689580	That'd be fun.
1689580	1691780	Yeah, and to win, you pay for it.
1691780	1695220	No, I'm just kidding.
1695220	1696220	Last email.
1696220	1697220	Yes.
1697220	1698220	Hey, it's me, Dr. Burst.
1698220	1702740	I took a few months off to get my grades up, but I'm pulling an all-nighter tonight to
1702740	1706500	get this essay done, and I'm listening live for motivation.
1706500	1709900	You can do it!
1709900	1712740	Oh, Jamie, always the inspirational one.
1712740	1716980	All I have to say is you guys have gotten four times better while I was gone.
1716980	1720940	I'm glad that the price changes on Live 365 did not kill you.
1720940	1724560	The show has helped me get over two pages out of three.
1724560	1725560	Good job, guys.
1725560	1726560	Keep it up.
1726560	1730180	That's 10,000 cups of coffee for the win, Dr. Burst.
1730180	1731180	Nice.
1731180	1733740	We've gotten four times better.
1733740	1739100	We must have been really bad before to be four times better now because I would say
1739100	1741500	we're only about, and we're like on the line right now.
1741500	1742500	You know what?
1742500	1753020	I lied because there's, well, it's an article that Robwith2B is linked to that I actually
1753020	1754220	think is pretty cool.
1754220	1762700	It's from Engadget as soon as it loads, but it's Sega protecting the Dreamcast trademark
1762700	1764340	but not doing another console.
1764340	1765340	Oh, God.
1765340	1766340	That whole debacle.
1766340	1767340	I forgot about that.
1767340	1776060	Well, if it'll ever load, but basically, Sega is saying that they're going to keep that
1776060	1784380	trademark so that they can, I guess, protect their rights in the Dreamcast name, but they're
1784380	1786460	not going to be doing any.
1786460	1790020	I want to know how the hell someone jumped to that conclusion that they're doing a Dreamcast
1790020	1792500	2 from them renewing the trademarks.
1792500	1795340	How did that rumor even start?
1795340	1797540	Because that kind of seems stupid to me.
1797540	1801020	They're quoted as saying they have no plans to get back into the console business.
1801020	1802020	Which is no surprise.
1802020	1804020	When I first read that rumor, I'm like, yeah, right.
1804020	1805020	Yeah, right.
1805020	1808540	They're going to put out a Dreamcast 2 right now and the market is crowded.
1808540	1811060	I just don't see Sega getting back into consoles anytime soon.
1811060	1815660	I mean, let's face it, sorry Sega fans, but the last few offerings from Sega have not
1815660	1819140	been all that, even in the console market.
1819140	1822300	So they got a lot of catching up to do, you know what I mean, before they start thinking
1822300	1823300	about a console again.
1823300	1825220	Okay, we got one last email.
1825220	1826220	All right.
1826220	1827220	Hurry up.
1827220	1828220	I was blinking.
1828220	1829220	Fine.
1829220	1830220	It says boobies.
1830220	1831220	I'm not joking.
1831220	1832220	The first word in it is boobies.
1832220	1833220	Is that from DMN?
1833220	1834220	No.
1834220	1835220	It's from the doctor.
1835220	1836220	Oh, okay.
1836220	1837220	LOL.
1837220	1839780	I'm thinking a lot of LOLs in my emails.
1839780	1840780	What is that about?
1840780	1841780	I love you guys.
1841780	1845020	Anyway, I'm going to try and buy some 360 before Christmas.
1845020	1848700	Thanks for the idea, Sky and Loki, the doctor.
1848700	1854100	Send me a TARDIS so I can, you know, go elsewhere and else win.
1854100	1857340	And now here, RossdielUT actually has a really good idea here.
1857340	1862740	He says I can imagine, for once, ha ha ha, no, just kidding, he says I can imagine they'll
1862740	1866620	just repackage a flashback-type console for Dreamcast games.
1866620	1869540	Now that I could see happening.
1869540	1873780	That is a sensible world of Dreamcast to me.
1873780	1878700	By the way, it was Mega Man Soccer I was trying to think of.
1878700	1879700	Let's see.
1879700	1880700	What else?
1880700	1882340	I'm getting lulled today with boobies.
1882340	1883620	Somebody else had a sensible joke.
1883620	1884620	Oh, yes.
1884620	1889620	ActDeft said when we go to the college campuses, it could be OLR, the Sensible World of Podcasting
1889620	1890620	Tour.
1890620	1891620	I like that name.
1891620	1896620	We should have that contest, contest, pay for us to come see you.
1896620	1897620	I like that idea.
1897620	1898620	Pay for our vacation.
1898620	1906420	Here's our new contest, pay for OLR to come to your town.
1906420	1910820	And they can make fun of your town and then maybe show some people how to do podcasting.
1910820	1914460	We'll record our podcast in your town if you pay.
1914460	1916860	But not at your house, because that would be creepy.
1916860	1920740	And you might not have good internet either.
1920740	1921740	Exactly.
1921740	1922740	My God.
1922740	1925420	The show is breaking our internet at this house.
1925420	1926860	We kind of tried to prep for it.
1926860	1927860	All right.
1927860	1928860	End of mailbag.
1928860	1930300	Let's get to some more stuff.
1930300	1933500	If you want to send in an email, give us some ego plus plus.
1933500	1934500	We always love that.
1934500	1937820	Mailbag at orangeontrado.com or some ego minus minus.
1937820	1940860	I think Jamie skipped some of the ego minus minus this week.
1940860	1949980	I skipped a reminder of manners addressed to one of our three that isn't you or me.
1949980	1953220	I was looking forward to that email because it was kind of funny.
1953220	1954220	Do you want me to read it?
1954220	1955220	Yes.
1955220	1956220	Read it because it's funny.
1956220	1957220	Okay.
1957220	1958220	You'll see why in a minute.
1958220	1959220	I have to open the email box again.
1959220	1960220	Hold on.
1960220	1961220	All right.
1961220	1962220	We're going to give her a minute.
1962220	1965500	Because there's an email that's criticizing Loki that I actually found kind of funny and
1965500	1967260	I want her to read it.
1967260	1968820	And it's funny because it's true.
1968820	1969820	It is so fucking true.
1969820	1970820	It is true.
1970820	1973920	And I've been listening all night long tonight and it is completely true and so that's why
1973920	1974920	I want to...
1974920	1975920	I know Loki's like, what the fuck did I do now?
1975920	1976920	I'm trying to log back into...
1976920	1977920	Okay.
1977920	1978920	Here we go.
1978920	1979920	I have to go in the old mail.
1979920	1985000	All criticisms of me are true.
1985000	1986000	So whatever.
1986000	1999540	Of course when you start playing the music now the email starts to load.
1999540	2000540	Old mail.
2000540	2001740	I can't wait to see.
2001740	2003920	I know because Op 11 is running.
2003920	2006920	Op 11 is going to...
2006920	2007920	Damn you, Op 11.
2007920	2010560	Yeah, yeah, Loki's like, oh, take your time.
2010560	2011360	Here we go.
2011360	2012760	Oh, hooray.
2012760	2016000	And this is from Mario.
2016000	2017080	Oh, shit.
2017080	2019280	You know that Mario's calling you out now.
2019280	2021760	Yeah, there are other people in the world named Mario
2021760	2025320	other than the video game character.
2025320	2027480	I will not say last names on the air, so.
2027480	2028600	All right.
2028600	2031800	Loki, I find that you are very rude to your co-hosts
2031800	2033600	and audience when you cut them off
2033600	2037000	with your standard introduction anyways.
2037000	2039240	Saying anyways after someone states
2039240	2041320	that whatever is said is not important.
2041320	2044300	What everyone says is important, even your thoughts
2044300	2045160	and comments.
2045160	2047480	Learn to stop saying anyways after anyone's statements
2047480	2049960	except your own statements.
2049960	2051200	Anyways, I don't really care.
2054480	2055480	It is true, though.
2055480	2056200	No, he does.
2056200	2056720	He does.
2056720	2058360	Well, there's people that interrupt me
2058360	2059560	all the fucking time.
2059560	2062600	You'll hear me going, hey, hey, I'm not doing talking yet.
2062600	2064160	Hey, listen.
2064160	2066080	Hey, listen.
2066080	2068760	Hey, listen.
2068760	2070400	It's over.
2070400	2071200	I'll say anyways.
2071200	2071880	It's over.
2071880	2072760	Well, please.
2072760	2074440	No, it's just funny.
2074440	2075960	We're just poking fun at you because I
2075960	2077680	don't think you really mean it to be rude,
2077680	2079520	but it's been kind of your transition word.
2079520	2081280	Like, you know, we've been working on our transit.
2081280	2083800	You know, going from one story to another, we try to be smooth.
2083800	2084960	Like, you know, oh, we're going to go from one,
2084960	2086280	we eat a story, another, we story.
2086280	2087280	When Loki's ready to go on a story,
2087280	2090480	it's like, OK, anyways, we got this game coming out.
2090480	2092880	Oh, my god, Rob, your light's just seizures.
2092880	2093820	Did they?
2093820	2095720	Yeah, they're just sitting here and we're on.
2095720	2096880	Blink.
2096880	2099360	And then it's because he has them on that one
2099360	2100720	where they cycle.
2100720	2102760	Yeah, they're on the cycle one where it goes to anything.
2102760	2104360	They cycle, you know, with a fake hand.
2104360	2106440	Well, I just happened to look over there when they were.
2106440	2108840	All right, anyways, can we get back into the gaming news now?
2108840	2111160	Definitely, we can get back into the gaming news,
2111160	2112240	and I'll stop shopping.
2115280	2117360	I want to get a little bell, and every time Loki
2117360	2118800	says anyways, I go, bing.
2118800	2120800	Weren't you going to get a bell for something else?
2120800	2122360	I know, there was something else I was going to get a bell for,
2122360	2123400	and I never did.
2123400	2125480	Oh, well, because I'm lazy.
2125480	2131160	So rock band ain't coming out in Canada until the 28th.
2131160	2133360	Sucks for you guys, but guess what?
2133360	2135960	You know, the problem is they don't
2135960	2137880	have enough guitars and instruments and stuff
2137880	2138480	to go around.
2138480	2141560	It doesn't help that their first batch of them also sucked.
2141560	2144160	Because they're having to send all the Canadian guitars out
2144160	2146520	as replacements for all the broken American ones,
2146520	2147640	and you know it's true.
2147640	2150240	Oh, yeah, probably.
2150240	2155840	So yeah, no rock band for you.
2155840	2159680	All right, sorry.
2159680	2162200	Moving on to the PSP.
2162200	2166160	PSP got a new game on the PC PlayStation Store.
2166160	2167320	How the hell does that work?
2167320	2169560	Well, there's this new game, and it's called Beats.
2169560	2172240	And for $4.99, what you do is you download this,
2172240	2173880	and you use this little tool on your PC
2173880	2176160	to put it on the memory stick.
2176160	2178000	And the game itself was developed
2178000	2181760	by Sony Computer Entertainment in Europe.
2181760	2183240	I guess apparently this was going
2183240	2186200	to be a UMD project, like an actual full game.
2186200	2188840	And there was actually going to be licensed music and videos.
2188840	2191720	Apparently the Sugar Babes, which is a British band,
2191720	2193200	was going to be involved.
2193200	2196480	But they decided to scrap that idea, thank god.
2196480	2199480	And what they did instead is that now for this $5 game,
2199480	2202520	it'll actually run off the MP3s that's on your PSP.
2202520	2205000	So it's very similar to that iPod game that just
2205000	2206240	came out phase.
2206240	2208040	But, well, it doesn't look the same.
2208040	2211680	To me, the game itself looks like one of those cut scenes
2211680	2214280	and get there, not cut scenes, but one
2214280	2215720	of the parts of Guitar Man.
2215720	2217680	Not the part where you're moving the analog stick around,
2217680	2218680	but the part where all the notes are
2218680	2219800	coming in towards the center.
2219800	2222760	When you are doing the attacks.
2222760	2223260	Yes.
2223260	2224920	Counting the attacks.
2224920	2226680	That's what this looks like to me.
2226680	2228280	Oh my god, you're right.
2228280	2231280	Now you can't get that on the PlayStation 3 store
2231280	2232880	for whatever reason, maybe soon.
2232880	2235240	But right now you can only get it on the PC store.
2235240	2236800	So there you go.
2236800	2239040	It looks very plain.
2239040	2241580	So, oh, I guess Tiger Claw actually
2241580	2246400	linked a YouTube video of our buddy Bobby playing beats.
2246400	2247720	So I'm curious about this.
2247720	2250240	And since the OP11's done, we should actually
2250240	2251080	have bandwidth now.
2251080	2252720	I want to look at this.
2252720	2254200	Let's see.
2254200	2256240	All right, there's a little watermark.
2256240	2257440	OK, here we go.
2257440	2260560	Let's take a look at this.
2260560	2261600	Looks kind of cute.
2261600	2262160	Let's see.
2262160	2264360	Let's get into the actual game play.
2264360	2265640	Oh, he's playing to his own show.
2265640	2266200	That's cute.
2270600	2271840	That's something else.
2271840	2273120	I don't know, the game itself doesn't
2273120	2274240	look that exciting, though.
2278200	2279680	There you have it.
2279680	2281080	Nice job, Bobby.
2281080	2282840	Good promotional piece, I got to say.
2282840	2284240	That's a good one.
2284240	2285400	Anyhow, that's it.
2285400	2286360	PSP beats.
2286360	2289440	Not something I think I'm going to run and grab my PSP for.
2289440	2292240	I don't know, it doesn't look that exciting to me.
2292240	2293640	You know what?
2293640	2295600	I'm not going to download it.
2295600	2298640	However, this is something I do want.
2298640	2302760	And by do want, I mean do want.
2302760	2303840	Finally.
2303840	2308280	Lumines is now available on the PC, yay.
2308280	2310600	My god, what else are they going to put this thing on?
2310600	2312200	The N-Gage?
2312200	2313960	Or is it already there?
2313960	2316480	I mean, the PC is like the last platform
2316480	2319720	I think this game is coming out on.
2319720	2322120	You've got a skin editing mode.
2322120	2326600	You have online score ranking.
2326600	2329280	It's going to be $19.99.
2329280	2336920	And there is a pay per play on a, bleh.
2336920	2340920	You can pay per play, or you can use a free version
2340920	2342800	that has ads all over it.
2342800	2343680	Does it have shine in?
2343680	2345040	That's all I really care about.
2345040	2348680	I don't know, but I'll get it.
2348680	2350960	All right, you let me know, and then I'll download it
2350960	2351960	if it has shine in it.
2351960	2353720	I'm going on there right now.
2353720	2355960	Shine in.
2355960	2363600	Anyways, yeah, because I didn't care what you're talking about.
2363600	2366480	You're all about shine in on it, because I'm not
2366480	2368560	going to play the game unless it has shine in.
2371160	2375320	He's at your home with Bell, so fuck off.
2375320	2377880	OK, so anyways, as I mentioned earlier in part A,
2377880	2381920	the Independent Games Festival is kind of wrapping up
2381920	2382420	here.
2382420	2383680	They have the finalists announced,
2383680	2385160	and it's a bunch of cool free games.
2385160	2387920	So definitely worth checking them out.
2387920	2392480	Some of the ones that they actually have available there
2392480	2396320	include some things that you'll see on Xbox Live Arcade soon,
2396320	2396840	actually.
2396840	2401240	In fact, they have one by the WIC developer.
2401240	2404120	I want to say it was Axiom Overdrive,
2404120	2408240	and that's going to be heading, I know, to live arcade
2408240	2410960	here pretty soon.
2410960	2413160	Some of the nominees here, they've
2413160	2416480	got best web browser game, including
2416480	2420000	IronDuke, Globus.com, and Triacnid.
2422820	2425220	Some of the games I've liked that I played here, Excellence
2425220	2426760	in Visual Art, Clean Asia.
2426760	2428600	Like I said, it's a good shoot-em-up game.
2428600	2432120	If you like Warning Forever, you might like that one.
2432120	2434240	There's also another one that you might like if you
2434240	2436720	like Warning Forever, which is called Battleships Forever.
2436720	2439160	It was inspired by that game, and it's another shoot-em-up
2439160	2440000	game.
2440000	2441440	So definitely worth checking out.
2441440	2445040	And also, if you want something to waste some time on,
2445040	2448320	also check out CRAN Physics Deluxe.
2448320	2451760	They have CRAN Physics, which you can play for free as well.
2451760	2455960	Fret Nice, also fun if you've got a Guitar Hero controller.
2455960	2457840	Highly recommend that game as well.
2457840	2459120	But anyways, just check it out.
2459120	2465800	It's at www.igf.com slash 02finalists.html.
2465800	2467640	And there's a bunch of links to free games,
2467640	2469440	and also go to all those sites.
2469440	2471120	You'll notice that there's also more free games on there
2471120	2471640	as well.
2471640	2473600	You know, I'm glad we really did that story tonight,
2473600	2475020	because I think sometimes we don't
2475020	2477280	give independent games enough loving on this show.
2477280	2480280	And for as much as we say rah, rah, rah, support
2480280	2481600	independent podcasting, we should
2481600	2483520	be talking more and more about independent games.
2483520	2485280	So we definitely should all take an effort
2485280	2486880	to check out some of these winners
2486880	2489360	and talk about them on the show.
2489360	2489880	Definitely.
2489880	2492840	And if you're also interested, there's links.
2492840	2496280	This is a 2008 one.
2496280	2499840	They also have links for the last 10 years in there.
2499840	2503800	They're winners, entrants, and mods, and whatnot.
2503800	2506520	So you can go ahead and check all those out as well.
2506520	2511120	In fact, last year, one of the winners for Design Innovation,
2511120	2513880	you might recognize Everyday Shooter.
2513880	2515640	So that's pretty cool.
2515640	2518660	Another Audience Award winner from last year,
2518660	2520760	Castle Crashers.
2520760	2524800	Also the GameTap Indie Awards, RoboBlitz,
2524800	2526880	and Everyday Shooter won that as well.
2526880	2529160	So a lot of these games, play them now,
2529160	2531680	because you'll probably see them on an online service
2531680	2538360	like the PlayStation Network or Xbox Live Arcade soon.
2538360	2539080	All right.
2539080	2541640	Well, something you might be seeing making a comeback soon
2541640	2545240	are the franchises MechWarrior, Shadowrun, and Crimson Skies.
2545240	2551160	Because Jordan Weissman has this new startup company, Smith
2551160	2552000	and Tinker.
2552000	2555120	And he basically has licensed back the electronic entertainment
2555120	2559360	rights to those franchises back from Microsoft.
2559360	2562720	And basically, these franchises were originally
2562720	2564600	developed by FASA.
2564600	2566520	And then Microsoft had it in 1999.
2566520	2569080	And they recently dissolved that.
2569080	2575040	So no really plans to further these franchises by Microsoft.
2575040	2577440	Which is probably good news, because Shadowrun really
2577440	2578800	didn't get a lot of love.
2578800	2583000	And it kind of seemed like these series were kind of done for.
2583000	2585280	But they are a lot of fans, especially Shadowrun.
2585280	2587360	You look at that, especially the old school
2587360	2589920	versions of Shadowrun, lots of people love those games
2589920	2591320	and are very excited at this news,
2591320	2597800	because maybe this is a sign that these series can
2597800	2599160	make a comeback.
2599160	2600600	So who knows?
2600600	2604400	Of course, the company who just bought them in Jordan Weissman's
2604400	2607000	group not said anything about it yet.
2607000	2608920	But you never know.
2608920	2611020	There is a cryptic posting that says, quote,
2611020	2613000	our goal is to surprise and delight
2613000	2617120	old fans while welcoming new fans to these fantastic worlds.
2617120	2620120	I used to play Shadowrun tabletop,
2620120	2622360	like the original Shadowrun, which
2622360	2625400	was RPG, actual D&D-style gaming.
2625400	2627820	But I'm going to guess you were just totally not interested
2627820	2629960	in the 360 one that came out recently.
2629960	2630520	No.
2630520	2631680	That's what happened with a lot of people.
2631680	2633520	So I think this is probably good news
2633520	2637720	that the franchise is back away from Microsoft, who
2637720	2639360	some would say ruined it.
2639360	2640440	But you can't win them all.
2640440	2641840	Microsoft's done a lot of things right,
2641840	2643280	but sometimes they get them wrong.
2643280	2644040	Yeah.
2644040	2645480	We forgive them sometimes.
2645480	2646160	Sometimes.
2646160	2649000	If they beg us.
2649000	2651400	Well, there has been a list released
2651400	2656160	of the top 20 games in Japan.
2656160	2661640	This is actually put out by, I think, let me see.
2661640	2664480	I'm trying to find the list that put it out, Next Gen.
2664480	2666840	2007 is Japan's top 20 games.
2666840	2668520	So we're not talking sales-wise, though.
2668520	2670640	We're talking like it's December,
2670640	2673840	here comes everybody's top 10 list, and all that stuff,
2673840	2674360	right?
2674360	2675880	Well, I've got a top 20, so I'm just
2675880	2676840	going to sort of skim through it.
2676840	2677480	Sure.
2677480	2680960	OK, number 20, DS Literature Companion,
2680960	2683200	which was on the DS.
2683200	2689080	And I don't see how that would be interesting,
2689080	2692720	but they were doing these cartridges for different,
2692720	2696720	classic Japanese novels, so that you know more about it.
2696720	2700120	I guess like Cliff Notes or something.
2700120	2706880	19 was Blade Storm for PS3, and Xbox 360 put out by Koei.
2706880	2710320	More Dynasty Warriors-ish game.
2710320	2713000	18 was Vision Training, Flash Focus
2713000	2715920	on Nintendo DS, which is exactly what it says.
2715920	2718600	It's little mini games for training your vision.
2718600	2721800	Wild Arms XF on PSP number 17.
2721800	2725200	Number 16, Game Center CX on Nintendo DS,
2725200	2729280	which is by Bandai Namco, which is actually
2729280	2732600	based off of a TV show.
2732600	2736520	And let's see, moving forward.
2736520	2742760	On number 15 is Trusty Bell, which was Eternal Sonata.
2742760	2744960	I like that game a lot.
2744960	2749800	14 is Face Training, to where you use the DS
2749800	2753720	camera to mimic a face.
2753720	2754960	That sounds stupid.
2754960	2757840	I know, it's sort of like how to smile a certain way.
2757840	2760120	It's one of the top games of the year.
2760120	2762320	13 was Ace Combat 6, which I don't see why,
2762320	2764480	because it's kind of boring.
2764480	2770280	12 was Subarashiki Konosekai, It's a Wonderful World
2770280	2772440	on Nintendo DS.
2772440	2776040	That's the one by Square Enix that's pretty awesome looking.
2776040	2778200	I like how the article says, the battle system plays
2778200	2779880	something like DDR for kids with ADHD.
2782520	2784040	That's interesting.
2784040	2787680	11, Treasure Island Z, The Adventures of Zack and Wiki
2787680	2789080	on Wii by Capcom.
2792040	2794600	Moving forward.
2794600	2795540	Come on.
2795540	2796720	There we go.
2796720	2800680	10, Crisis Core Final Fantasy VII on PSP.
2800680	2802320	Like, I have to explain that.
2802320	2805520	9, Legend of Zelda, The Phantom Hourglass.
2805520	2811000	8, Armor Dine, which was on PlayStation 2.
2811000	2814520	Another one of those mecha fighting weird strategy RPG
2814520	2815840	things.
2815840	2824040	7, Yusho no Kusei ni Namaihita on PSP,
2824040	2826800	which is put out by Acquire.
2826800	2830120	Acquire gave us Tenchu, by the way.
2830120	2833600	6, No More Heroes, which we were just
2833600	2837680	going over during our break.
2837680	2840640	Very interesting looking little game.
2840640	2843800	And then the last few, the top five.
2843800	2849120	Number five is Lost Odyssey, Xbox 360.
2849120	2850960	I've been hearing some not so great things
2850960	2851880	about Lost Odyssey.
2851880	2856000	I'm very curious to check it out when it comes out here.
2856000	2859040	I'm kind of of two minds about it, I'm thinking about it.
2859040	2861880	Four is Super Mario Galaxy.
2861880	2865560	Three is Wii Fit.
2865560	2869800	Two is Professor Layton and the Curious Village on Nintendo DS,
2869800	2871360	put up by level five.
2871360	2873720	And number one is Pac-Man Championship Edition,
2873720	2875520	Xbox Live Arcade.
2875520	2877680	Interesting.
2877680	2879280	Interesting choices.
2879280	2882560	That game gets a lot of play in my house.
2882560	2884120	I'm actually curious about this.
2884120	2886320	We were posted a link in chat from Rossdiel UT.
2886320	2889120	It's a commercial for face training straight out of Japan.
2889120	2891720	So this ought to be a hoot.
2891720	2896160	DS, the kono training.
2896160	2903120	Pokkaku to hou hichiangemasu, ichii, ni, san, shii.
2903120	2905560	You have to smile and turn your face.
2905560	2912960	Yoho no mai wo hichiangemasu, ichii, ni, san, shii.
2912960	2919280	Yojo yutakani isho apu, otona no DS, kao to renin.
2919280	2922680	My god, it looks like it's creepy.
2922680	2927880	That commercial's creepy because it makes it seem like we will be
2927880	2932880	absorbing your brain in five, four, three, two, one.
2932880	2940280	Are they trying to imply that the Japanese people do not
2940280	2941200	have emotion?
2941200	2941840	That's racist.
2941840	2948760	That they need to, you know, look like everybody else.
2948760	2951320	You know, it's basically a trainer for pod people
2951320	2954200	so that we can't see who they are.
2954200	2955320	That's really what it is.
2955320	2956620	That's a strange looking game.
2956620	2959120	All right.
2959120	2961520	Well, one thing that you won't be smiling about,
2961520	2964120	well, maybe you will be because I know I haven't been here
2964120	2966520	in a while, CompUSA.
2966520	2969480	Apparently, they are shutting down the remaining stores
2969480	2970480	that they have.
2970480	2979240	And so yeah, I think closing 126 stores that are left.
2979240	2981040	Which you know what that means.
2981040	2983200	Liquidation sales.
2983200	2983840	Yay.
2983840	2986480	So make your way down to your local CompUSA
2986480	2989000	for some sweet deals on old games, I'm sure.
2989000	2991400	Except for the fact I looked and there's
2991400	2992880	no more CompUSAs in Sacramento.
2992880	2994000	They got rid of all of them.
2994000	2994680	Already, yeah.
2994680	2996520	Closest ones are in the Bay Area.
2996520	2998880	So I'm not driving all the way over there just
2998880	3000760	for some cheap games.
3000760	3003080	So sorry, CompUSA.
3003080	3004880	Nice knowing you when you were still around.
3004880	3007440	We bought one of our computers from CompUSA one time,
3007440	3011080	like way back in the day, with its whopping one meg of RAM.
3013600	3017640	Something that some people wish would go away and close down
3017640	3020320	for business forever is the Dr. Phil show.
3020320	3022920	Of course, Dr. Phil burned a lot of bridges with gamers
3022920	3024880	earlier this year with some of his comments.
3024880	3026960	However, it's very interesting because he
3026960	3030400	had that show about, well, I guess the whole show
3030400	3032000	wasn't about Second Life.
3032000	3034840	But he had the show about shocking teen trends.
3034840	3037320	And it actually focused on the, I'm sorry,
3037320	3038600	it actually wasn't Second Life.
3038600	3041160	It was a Second Life type of game called There.
3041160	3042880	And I should know There a little better
3042880	3044360	because one of the folks who used
3044360	3047120	to come on the show a lot back in the day, DDR Angel,
3047120	3048440	she was really into There.
3048440	3050560	And I want to say for a time worked for the company.
3050560	3051520	She may still even be there.
3051520	3052480	I don't know.
3052480	3053800	That's why we haven't heard from her in a while.
3053800	3055640	Maybe she needs to go on the Dr. Phil show.
3055640	3059240	No, no, I, that's, well, apparently this girl,
3059240	3061320	this 13-year-old girl, Lexi, she spends
3061320	3062600	like all her time on there.
3062600	3065120	She had a boyfriend in there.
3065120	3067040	And she had, like, they would make out
3067040	3068480	on their bed and everything.
3068480	3070760	Like, she had real feelings for this guy, I think.
3070760	3073320	So.
3073320	3074320	Sadly.
3074320	3074840	What?
3074840	3076000	I saw the show.
3076000	3078720	Oh, what?
3078720	3080200	You watched the Dr. Phil show.
3080200	3082120	My wife watches the Dr. Phil show.
3082120	3083720	Oh, and it just happened to be there.
3083720	3086280	You couldn't, like, you know, go to the other room or anything?
3086280	3088480	I had already been in the other room the entire day.
3088480	3091440	So, you know, I have to come out some time
3091440	3095160	and spend quality time with my wife and also eat dinner.
3095160	3098840	Well, then, did you have fun watching the Dr. Phil show?
3098840	3100640	No, because we always make fun of Dr. Phil.
3100640	3102320	We always mock him.
3102320	3105320	I'm Dr. Phil, OK?
3105320	3107760	He's like a lot like Mr. Mackey.
3107760	3112040	He's like, yeah, I'm Dr. Phil, and you should stop doing that.
3112040	3113120	Well, what's interesting.
3113120	3115400	OK, what's interesting is what Dr. Phil, and you
3115400	3116680	may think that, you know, he's going
3116680	3118400	to say something kind of narrow-minded and stupid,
3118400	3121240	but he actually ends up having some pretty decent advice.
3121240	3122840	He says, quote, because he actually
3122840	3126920	had the CEO from there come on the show and kind of defend.
3126920	3128600	So, like, you know, he got all ends of it.
3128600	3131320	He said, quote, the problem is not with the game.
3131320	3133400	The problem is the use of it.
3133400	3135360	The game is very creative, and it's there
3135360	3137320	for you to use or abuse.
3137320	3139440	Are you abusing it?
3139440	3140680	Yeah, and she said yes.
3140680	3142080	She's like, yes, I am abusing it.
3142080	3144200	And it's like, oh, OK, that was easy.
3144200	3145440	And here's the thing.
3145440	3150120	Mom limited play to four hours a day.
3150120	3152480	And so Dr. Phil says, four hours a day?
3152480	3153600	It's ridiculous.
3153600	3156600	Mom, you've got to step up and shut this down, OK?
3156600	3159160	Once she's at a point where she can play the game instead
3159160	3161360	of being absorbed in the game, OK, then
3161360	3164480	perhaps she can attempt to get back to it.
3164480	3166320	That was the official advice from Dr. Phil.
3166320	3170040	So it actually seems like that was good at telling the parent
3170040	3173200	that the parent needs to pull the plug on the game
3173200	3174960	and get the kid to do something else
3174960	3178160	and stop passively accepting it.
3178160	3180600	Well, the parent is the one paying the credit.
3180600	3182920	This has a monthly subscription fee, I believe,
3182920	3187040	where you can buy money in this game using your credit card.
3187040	3189520	Well, the kid does not have a credit card,
3189520	3194040	so stop giving her money, you moron.
3194040	3195760	Wasn't this also the episode of Dr. Phil
3195760	3198320	that the lawyer of no name was claiming
3198320	3200800	that he was supposed to be invited to and never
3200800	3203280	went through with it?
3203280	3204360	Who cares about that guy?
3204360	3206520	Yeah, he's going to be disbarred at the end of the year.
3206520	3207320	So over him.
3207320	3209000	So over him.
3209000	3210240	Yeah, he's going to be gone.
3210240	3211640	He ain't.
3211640	3219200	Well, there is a new games rating system, a campaign
3219200	3221760	to be launched for renting the games.
3221760	3226440	There's a couple of Delaware political folks
3226440	3230200	are hanging out with the ESRB and trying
3230200	3233000	to bring out new public service announcements
3233000	3236520	that these new ratings are supposed
3236520	3239240	to be adhered to or whatever.
3239240	3239840	You know what?
3242560	3244280	Can't they look at the box?
3244280	3246960	Parents don't know the rating system, I swear.
3246960	3250080	True story, last night I'm at Walmart
3250080	3252880	and I'm looking at the Wii games because I kind of still
3252880	3253880	want to get trauma centers.
3253880	3255440	I was kind of looking how much they're charging for it
3255440	3257240	because I was there to get some other stuff.
3257240	3261120	And there's this parent and the kid is playing Xbox 360,
3261120	3262680	the little demo kiosk, right?
3262680	3264080	And he's going, I want this game.
3264080	3264800	I want this game.
3264800	3266360	And she goes, well, what's it rated?
3266360	3267760	So OK, good question.
3267760	3268880	She says, what's it rated?
3268880	3270480	And the kid goes, RP.
3270480	3273240	And the mom's all, what's that mean?
3273240	3274440	She's all, what does RP mean?
3274440	3274960	I don't know.
3274960	3275520	And I'm just kind of thinking to myself.
3275520	3277640	RP's not even on the list.
3277640	3278920	It's rating pending.
3278920	3279800	RP is rating pending.
3279800	3281880	They do have it on the ESRB poster.
3281880	3284440	Yeah, but that's what I'll bring to fill the wall.
3284440	3285360	I've got some ESRB.
3285360	3287800	That would be a good thing to fill the wall with.
3287800	3289240	So if any parents watch our show, it reminds me of that.
3289240	3290440	I have like hundreds of them.
3290440	3293520	And me being the nosy fucker I am, I jumped in there
3293520	3297360	and I said, I was like, it means rating pending.
3297360	3299240	It's like a movie that hasn't been rated.
3299240	3300240	I was thinking RPGs.
3300240	3301440	Oh, no.
3301440	3303640	No, well, that's the thing.
3303640	3304680	I've been saying this for years.
3304680	3306320	It should mirror the movie system.
3306320	3310280	If it said R or PG-13 or not yet rated,
3310280	3311920	people would know what that meant.
3311920	3313320	And I said, well, what's the game?
3313320	3315440	And she said it was Naruto.
3315440	3318560	And I told her, I said Naruto is based on a cartoon.
3318560	3320320	The worst thing you're going to see in it is cartoon violence.
3320320	3321440	It's a team.
3321440	3322120	It's rated team.
3322120	3323120	It's rated team?
3323120	3324280	Why?
3324280	3325560	Because of cartoon violence.
3325560	3327000	Because it's beating up?
3327000	3328120	Oh, whoops.
3328120	3329960	I told her, I'm like, it's a cartoon.
3329960	3332520	It's fine for your seven-year-old.
3332520	3333520	Oops.
3333520	3335360	Well, that's actually the same thing.
3335360	3337040	I think that the anime community has
3337040	3340080	been sort of arguing against people for years now.
3340080	3343160	That just because it's animated doesn't mean it's for kids.
3343160	3343660	Hm.
3343660	3344880	Oops.
3344880	3346040	Have you seen Perfect Blue?
3346040	3348440	But I said the worst thing you're going to see in it
3348440	3349520	is cartoon violence.
3349520	3350280	Or boobs.
3350280	3351000	So.
3351000	3352800	They do not have boobs in Naruto.
3352800	3354440	They do not have boobs in Naruto.
3354440	3355920	Yes, they do.
3355920	3358200	I would like to see this on Cartoon Network.
3358200	3358680	I mean.
3358680	3363240	The sexy no-jokes, so yes, you do get boobies.
3363240	3364320	All right.
3364320	3364800	Ha ha.
3364800	3367280	If that were the case, that show would be a lot more popular.
3367280	3369400	There are cloud-covered boobies, but there's still boobies.
3369400	3370120	OK.
3370120	3370640	Yeah, yeah.
3370640	3371300	Here's the thing.
3371300	3371800	Look.
3371800	3373160	DS68 is like Sky.
3373160	3375000	You know the Japanese anime cartoons,
3375000	3376200	not necessarily kid safe.
3376200	3379080	OK, it wasn't La Blue Girl the Game, OK?
3379080	3379760	It wasn't that.
3379760	3380760	It was freaking Naruto.
3380760	3381520	That's rated E.
3381520	3384960	Which is on a rated EC for early childhood.
3384960	3386840	Naruto's on freaking Cartoon Network.
3386840	3388120	I know that.
3388120	3390600	I didn't think it would be that bad.
3390600	3391080	Oh, well.
3391080	3392640	So what's the worst that happens?
3392640	3394520	Some seven-year-old kid sees boobies.
3394520	3395320	I mean, come on.
3399280	3401560	Moving on.
3401560	3403400	Anyways.
3403400	3405720	Ding.
3405720	3408920	I did that on purpose.
3408920	3412320	So anyways, I love doing that.
3412320	3415720	A watchdog group, of course, the Nymph,
3415720	3420520	they've gave the game industry a C. Of course, each year,
3420520	3424440	they put out their video game report card.
3424440	3426520	You know, this is like one of those things where,
3426520	3428960	who the fuck are these people, and why should I care?
3428960	3433480	Well, they are the National Institute
3433480	3435720	on Media and the Family.
3435720	3439760	They basically will do those wonderful undercover stings
3439760	3442040	where they'll see if people will sell them M-rated games
3442040	3447200	and stuff like that, or their kids and whatnot.
3447200	3450600	Really, my thing is, who gives a shit if they're rating?
3450600	3453040	So if I rated the industry an F, would people
3453040	3454600	give a shit that I'm rating an F?
3454600	3455640	No one really cares.
3455640	3458720	This industry, or watchdog organization, excuse me,
3458720	3460520	this watchdog organization sounds
3460520	3462880	like the group in Footloose that told the townspeople they
3462880	3463960	can't dance.
3463960	3465840	Something like that.
3465840	3469400	But apparently, they've conducted a lot of research.
3469400	3471600	They found that 52% of the parents
3471600	3473840	claim to use the ESRB rating system,
3473840	3477920	but 72% know little or nothing about the rating system
3477920	3480760	overall.
3480760	3483320	72 plus 52 does not equal 100.
3483320	3484320	I'm confused.
3484320	3486840	But people use it, despite the fact
3486840	3488640	that they don't know anything about it.
3488640	3493320	That has, so that game's rated M. I like the letter M. Go,
3493320	3494880	son, you can buy it.
3494880	3496720	Is that how they do it?
3496720	3498160	Seriously.
3498160	3500640	Everybody cut loose, Footloose.
3500640	3504920	Apparently, undercover shoppers that were under the age of 18
3504920	3511080	were able to buy M-rated games at nearly 50% of the time.
3511080	3512800	But really, here's the thing, though.
3512800	3515880	It's store policy not to sell M-rated games to minors.
3515880	3517960	There's no law that says they have to do that.
3517960	3519520	So what's it matter?
3519520	3521680	And in fact, I would tell them that.
3521680	3522880	To their faces?
3522880	3526840	Yes, if I was a person that, oh, you sold me an M-rated game,
3526840	3531080	and I'm under 18, I'd be like, so?
3531080	3533400	Loki, you should join one of these watchdog organizations
3533400	3535400	just for laughs.
3535400	3537160	Maybe like an undercover report.
3537160	3541000	What really goes on in these watchdog organizations?
3541000	3543160	I would like to see a watchdog organization
3543160	3545680	for the watchdog organizations.
3545680	3546680	I like that.
3546680	3547880	I'm going to rate them.
3547880	3549720	I think this is a fabulous idea.
3549720	3553720	So what would we call our watchdog organization?
3553720	3554560	You think about that.
3554560	3555200	Chat room.
3555200	3556920	I'm putting that challenge to you guys.
3556920	3558120	Ooh, ooh, ooh, what?
3558120	3559400	I know, I know.
3559400	3561480	Their nymph, I'll be nymph-o.
3564920	3566040	I like that.
3566040	3567760	I don't know what the O would stand for.
3571160	3572280	Overseer, there we go.
3572280	3574160	That'll work.
3574160	3579120	I'll be the National Institute on Media and Family Overseer.
3579120	3580400	Nymph-o.
3580400	3581680	Love it.
3581680	3584880	That's beautiful.
3584880	3586960	That's one of the greatest insights to come.
3586960	3589280	And the years I've been doing this radio program,
3589280	3593000	that's one of the greatest, I'll tell you.
3593000	3593520	Anyhow.
3593520	3595720	That's lovely.
3595720	3596360	Oh, RossDielUT.
3596360	3597560	You did it, too.
3597560	3598400	I like this.
3598400	3599000	You did it.
3599000	3599500	What?
3599500	3600040	You said it.
3600040	3601400	Oh, forget it.
3601400	3602320	Who cares?
3602320	3605720	RossDielUT says, the Institute for a Media Whore,
3605720	3606360	Free America.
3609120	3613320	Dark Tetsuya says, National Institute Media Family, OLR.
3613320	3616800	Frisbee says, OLR is watching you poop.
3616800	3617960	I don't know about that one.
3617960	3620840	I don't want to watch that.
3620840	3622640	The hell is wrong with you people?
3622640	3624280	OLR is watching you poop in a tube.
3624280	3626320	That's gross.
3626320	3628520	I mean, Loki watched those two girls poop in a cup,
3628520	3630560	but that's something completely different.
3630560	3632120	I think a lot of people watch that.
3632120	3634040	Anyhow, moving on.
3634040	3636440	Let's talk about Eve Online.
3636440	3640600	This is a game that has quite a bit of a following to it.
3640600	3642580	And I know when I was on another show a couple weeks
3642580	3644800	ago, there was definitely a lot of talk about Eve Online.
3644800	3649760	Well, Eve Online went offline earlier this week.
3649760	3652760	What happened is that there was a new update that went out.
3652760	3655280	It was the Premium Trinity patch.
3655280	3657280	And it went out a little earlier this week,
3657280	3658560	I think about Thursday-ish.
3658560	3660720	And what happened is that it added a bunch of new features
3660720	3661440	to the game.
3661440	3667000	But the patch also removed the boot.ini file off
3667000	3675880	of your Windows XP, which kind of fucks your operating system.
3675880	3678080	And there was a quote from the official support page.
3678080	3680880	Quote, if you are only using the classic client
3680880	3683400	or installed the premium client using the full premium
3683400	3685120	installer, then you are not affected.
3685120	3688000	If you upgraded the classic client to the premium client
3688000	3690280	using the content upgrade, then please read on.
3690280	3692120	Check the root directory of your hard drive
3692120	3694120	and see if you have a boot.ini file.
3694120	3696720	If so, then you are not affected.
3696720	3698400	The file is normally hidden, so you
3698400	3700240	need to click Tools Folder Options View
3700240	3702360	and select Show Hidden Files and Folders
3702360	3704440	and uncheck Hide Protected Operating System Files
3704440	3705440	to be able to see it.
3705440	3707920	You can also blah, blah, blah, blah, so on and so on.
3707920	3709600	What the fuck were you doing touching
3709600	3710920	that file in the first place?
3710920	3712920	That's what I want to know.
3712920	3714640	How did that happen?
3714640	3717280	Seriously, there's a part of me that goes, some pissed off
3717280	3720160	bitch in this organization threw that in there,
3720160	3722760	just to fuck with these guys.
3722760	3723320	That's so sad.
3723320	3725160	I bet she's planning on quitting.
3725160	3729640	And so, program delete boot.ini.
3729640	3732080	Bye, my two weeks are on.
3732080	3735120	Let me know how the program works.
3735120	3735840	For real.
3735840	3738040	I quit.
3738040	3740360	Frisbee says, uh-oh, SpaghettiOs.
3740360	3742280	I'll take my severance pay now.
3745560	3747720	Have fun storming the castle.
3747720	3750720	I mean, yeah, don't touch the boot.ini file.
3750720	3753800	But at the same time, Windows XP should,
3753800	3756360	if you're going to delete a file like that, it should go,
3756360	3758280	are you sure?
3758280	3760640	Windows XP should have a little dialog box that says,
3760640	3763080	when you delete this file, you will fuck your whole computer
3763080	3763640	up.
3763640	3765680	Are you sure you want to delete this file?
3765680	3767640	And a little picture Bill Gates going, no, no, no.
3767640	3768880	I bet there is something.
3768880	3774520	But even if it does, this person now that I'm imagining
3774520	3777680	is going, click yes for, are you sure?
3780960	3783520	Rob D says, it sounds like the simcopter bug.
3783520	3785120	Do you remember the simcopter bug?
3785120	3788160	Where it was one of the first appearances of same sex
3788160	3790720	relations in the game, because a gay programmer actually
3790720	3794320	programmed it in there that guys would kiss guys
3794320	3796320	on this guy's birthday.
3796320	3797640	And then left the company.
3797640	3798840	That's great.
3798840	3801320	It was more than that, I think.
3801320	3804120	There was a lot more than kissing going on there.
3804120	3805400	Please, this is a family show.
3805400	3806320	We don't need to go there.
3806320	3808360	Right, this is a family show.
3808360	3811040	This is a dysfunctional family show.
3811040	3812880	All right, we're going to open up the Skype line
3812880	3815340	and welcome the extended members of our dysfunctional family.
3815340	3816960	That would be you folks, the listeners.
3816960	3821280	1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
3821280	3823880	And I am dying to see how this works tonight when I only
3823880	3826160	have half the strength out here on the Wi-Fi network
3826160	3829160	out in the garage, and we're trying to stream a show.
3829160	3831600	This could be very interesting, so we'll see what happens.
3831600	3834200	Again, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
3834200	3836200	Or our username is OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype.
3836200	3836680	We have a call.
3836680	3837760	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.
3837760	3838840	Who's this?
3838840	3839920	This is Ravenstaufen.
3839920	3840800	How are you today?
3840800	3841920	I am super.
3841920	3842760	Thanks for asking.
3842760	3844160	How are you?
3844160	3846900	I am fine, and I got two things for you tonight.
3846900	3848520	You was talking about the Dreamcast?
3848520	3850160	We was.
3850160	3853600	I actually found my Dreamcast, and my brother owned one.
3853600	3857120	So I found my old Dreamcast, and it was see-through.
3857120	3858280	I don't know why.
3858280	3859480	I can't remember why.
3859480	3862400	But it's see-through, and it's beautiful.
3862400	3865280	Because you probably bought a case mod.
3865280	3867080	Probably.
3867080	3867840	Or maybe eBay.
3867840	3869080	I can't remember anymore.
3869080	3870200	My memory's fading.
3870200	3874080	They did sell, though, a new case for the Dreamcast
3874080	3875760	that you could make that was clear.
3875760	3880280	And they also sold a bootleg of the Hello Kitty one, too.
3880280	3882080	Does Rob got that one?
3882080	3883520	Do I have what?
3883520	3884880	The Hello Kitty Dreamcast?
3884880	3887320	No, I do not have the Hello Kitty Dreamcast.
3887320	3889040	I was actually very excited, because I
3889040	3891200	found that I have two Dreamcasts.
3891200	3894720	But then this guy named Loki said that one of his is his.
3894720	3897960	So what's up with that?
3897960	3900200	Why am I hearing myself?
3900200	3900840	Is that better?
3900840	3901160	Sorry about that.
3901160	3901960	Yes, much better.
3901960	3904080	Thank you.
3904080	3905240	So what else is on your mind?
3905240	3905880	That was one thing.
3905880	3906480	What's the other?
3906480	3907000	GameTap.
3907000	3908120	GameTap's on my mind.
3908120	3909720	I got a free month from GameTap.
3909720	3910760	Very nice of them.
3910760	3912960	You realize they released a Mac client
3912960	3914720	to their beautiful GameTap?
3914720	3915160	I did.
3915160	3915480	I heard.
3915480	3916320	Wait, hold on.
3916320	3920160	Is SimCopter one of the games you can play in the GameTap?
3920160	3921360	No.
3921360	3922760	Oh, it's one of the ones you remove?
3922760	3923720	Well, here's the thing.
3923720	3925840	We got linked the Wikipedia article.
3925840	3926480	Here it is.
3926480	3928600	The game gained controversy when a designer
3928600	3932520	inserted sprites of shirtless himbos, male bimbos,
3932520	3933440	in speedo trunks.
3933440	3934880	I love that term, himbos.
3934880	3936880	I'm going to use that in the sentence every day.
3936880	3938920	In speedo trunks, who hugged and kissed
3938920	3941840	each other, who appear in great numbers on certain dates,
3941840	3943680	their fluorescent nipples were drawn
3943680	3946040	with a special rendering mode.
3946040	3949080	It's usually reserved for fog-piercing runway landing
3949080	3952280	lights, so they could easily be seen from long distances
3952280	3953640	and bad weathers.
3953640	3955720	An unintended emergent behavior of the code
3955720	3958040	caused hundreds of himbos to swarm and crowd
3958040	3960400	around the helicopter, where they would be slashed up
3960400	3961800	by the blades and then need to be
3961800	3965240	airlifted to the hospital, which earned the player easy money.
3965240	3967120	The Easter egg was caught shortly after release
3967120	3969560	and removed from future copies of the game.
3969560	3970560	Here's how you access it.
3970560	3971880	And then the designer was fired.
3971880	3972640	He didn't leave.
3972640	3973560	He got fired.
3973560	3975280	Here's how you access it, too.
3975280	3976800	Apparently, if you go into the game,
3976800	3979280	you go into career mode, hit Control-Alt-X,
3979280	3985960	and then you type in, warp me to career 29, or colon 29.
3985960	3989240	And then once you've done that, you do Control-Alt-X,
3989240	3990760	been there, done that.
3990760	3992400	And then apparently, in a few seconds,
3992400	3995680	about 300 guys in bathing suits will appear.
3995680	3998560	It says, for fun, since there are no military helicopters
3998560	4003560	in the game, fire tear gas at them.
4003560	4005360	That's just wrong.
4005360	4006720	All right, sorry, Ravenstauffer.
4006720	4007600	I agree with that.
4007600	4009240	I think it was disgruntled someone.
4009240	4012480	But who the fuck is messing with the frickin' IDF
4012480	4014480	file to corrupt your computer?
4014480	4018000	They ever thought to them that it doesn't
4018000	4019520	start your operating system?
4019520	4021680	So how the hell do you find it in the first place?
4021680	4024440	Somebody needs to explain funny, not funny.
4024440	4027760	Deleting my boot INI file, not funny.
4027760	4029840	Himbos, funny.
4029840	4032160	So if you're going to do something disgruntled,
4032160	4034800	make it funny.
4034800	4036000	Yeah, but you can't find it.
4036000	4037800	They said their thing is like, you
4037800	4041000	can't get in the operating system, how do you find it?
4041000	4041840	You're screwed.
4041840	4044320	You have to use a disk, basically.
4044320	4045520	So anyhow, I'm sorry.
4045520	4047680	What was the other thing you wanted to call in about tonight?
4047680	4049840	It's about the Mac client of GameTap.
4049840	4053440	There's a brand new Mac client.
4053440	4055000	I need to check it out.
4055000	4057260	But do you still have to have the Intel
4057260	4058800	chip in your Mac for it to work?
4058800	4059800	Oh, then never mind.
4059800	4061760	Nah, I can't use it.
4061760	4063000	Lame.
4063000	4064480	But it's much lighter.
4064480	4067200	More games run smoothly on the Mac.
4067200	4069000	And on the Windows side as well, everything
4069000	4070440	runs great on both sides.
4070440	4072720	But now you can't run the Windows-based games
4072720	4073440	on the Mac, right?
4073440	4074760	They just took that category out ahead.
4074760	4075840	No, no, that's gone.
4075840	4076360	I figured.
4076360	4079600	The Windows games, so you lost like 800 games on the Mac side.
4079600	4081320	Oh, Jesus.
4081320	4082760	Well, but that makes sense.
4082760	4085040	I mean, but you still get all the arcade games.
4085040	4086520	You get the Genesis games.
4086520	4087520	Oh, well, that's cool.
4087520	4088840	Atari 2600?
4088840	4090040	DOS.
4090040	4091600	Oh, you get the DOS games?
4091600	4092800	You get DOS games as well.
4092800	4094240	Well, that makes sense because of the chip.
4094240	4095040	Well, that's cool.
4095040	4095560	Well, good.
4095560	4096200	I'm glad.
4096200	4097640	There were a lot of people really pissed off
4097640	4099800	about the fact that there was no GameTap Mac client.
4099800	4100520	So good for them.
4100520	4101960	I'm making good on that.
4101960	4102800	I think one thing.
4102800	4106000	I'm going to add one thing to that.
4106000	4108360	I got a free month from them, so I'm happy about that.
4108360	4110760	Who'd you have to blow to get that?
4110760	4111240	No one.
4111240	4113240	I just said I have problems with the PC version.
4113240	4117240	I'm like, well, we'll just add another free month for you.
4117240	4118920	Dang, I'm going to call GameTap and tell
4118920	4121440	them I have some problems.
4121440	4125200	Yeah, my boot INI file got deleted by your client.
4125200	4126280	Let's see what happens.
4126280	4128240	All right, Raven's Dolphin, any other quick thoughts
4128240	4130160	before I let you go and get to somebody else?
4130160	4132720	No, but I think that sucks.
4132720	4135840	How do you get a game like that and just boot a game
4135840	4137720	and you go like, well, I got it.
4137720	4140080	And then you restart your computer, and you're like,
4140080	4140880	what the fuck?
4140880	4141800	What happened?
4141800	4143440	Yeah, it sucks to be those guys.
4143440	4145560	I'm really sorry to all the EVE Online players who
4145560	4146800	got fucked over by that one.
4146800	4147440	It sucks to be you.
4147440	4148680	All right, I'm going back to Godfather.
4148680	4150600	All right, see you.
4150600	4153120	All right, if you want to give us a call, 877-GAME-OLR.
4153120	4155160	Our user name on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
4155160	4156920	We'll also get to some last minute stories,
4156920	4158400	and then the show is done.
4158400	4160080	Hooray.
4160080	4161980	I mean, aw, that's sad, because then there's
4161980	4163520	no more OLR till next week.
4163520	4165000	What are you going to do?
4165000	4166880	All right, phone's not ringing just yet,
4166880	4169200	so let's get a couple of quick last minute stories.
4169200	4170120	Oh, I lied.
4170120	4171760	Here it comes.
4171760	4173120	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.
4173120	4174280	Who's this?
4174280	4177280	Hey, Sky, it's Jonathan F. Your fantasy star whore.
4177280	4179240	Well, hello, our fantasy star whore.
4179240	4180960	How are you?
4180960	4183640	I'm doing just fine here.
4183640	4186200	Are you playing the abortion of the aluminous,
4186200	4188360	or whatever that's called?
4188360	4190000	Ambition of the aluminous, actually.
4190000	4191760	I see.
4191760	4194480	Yeah, you can find me running around with a rappy called
4194480	4195880	Brightstar.
4195880	4197720	Anyway, I wanted to just call in,
4197720	4200080	let you know about some of the big stories that are
4200080	4202200	going on right now with this.
4202200	4204600	The first big one is that there's actually
4204600	4206600	another expansion coming out.
4206600	4210360	But the thing about this one is that it's for the PSP only.
4210360	4212000	And funny enough, it's named.
4212000	4213680	Wait, the PSP?
4213680	4216360	Yeah, PSP's getting a fantasy star game.
4216360	4218120	So wait, this can't be an expansion.
4218120	4219440	This is a whole new game, right?
4219440	4220880	Yeah, it's a whole new game.
4220880	4223600	Well, basically what it is, it's going
4223600	4225560	to expand upon the story that's already there
4225560	4228120	and add some new missions into it.
4228120	4229480	And the real funny thing about it
4229480	4231960	is that when you condense it from its original name,
4231960	4235520	fantasy star portable, it makes PSP.
4235520	4236440	Oh, no, there you go.
4236440	4239080	So PSP on the PSP.
4239080	4240280	Exactly.
4240280	4241800	There you have it.
4241800	4242320	Interesting.
4242320	4244840	So what else is going on in the fantasy star world?
4244840	4246800	How was the new expansion received?
4246800	4249680	Because I know the fantasy star universe kind of
4249680	4251480	turned some people off to the series.
4251480	4254080	It wasn't all that and a bag of chips for some people.
4254080	4257320	But I guess some of the things they added back in
4257320	4258880	with this expansion are supposedly
4258880	4262480	making the game a little more kind of like it used to be?
4262480	4263280	Exactly.
4263280	4266960	In fact, go ahead.
4266960	4268640	I'm sorry, go ahead.
4268640	4269600	Oh, OK.
4269600	4271800	Basically what's coming back in this version,
4271800	4275600	actually, starting in just a couple of short weeks
4275600	4278680	here in Japan, or over in Japan, I mean,
4278680	4282240	there's going to be an event called the Maximum Attack G,
4282240	4284880	whereby they are bringing back some of the original fantasy
4284880	4287200	star online stages.
4287200	4289560	Now that could be kind of cool.
4289560	4291760	I know.
4291760	4293680	They're going to bring back Cave.
4293680	4297000	And what were the names of those stages in the old one?
4297000	4300000	They had Cave and, what, Ship?
4300000	4303120	Well, yeah, the Forest Cave, Mines, and Ruins,
4303120	4305160	they are all confirmed at this point, pretty much.
4305160	4308320	Wow, that's kind of cool.
4308320	4310640	Unfortunately, I'm not aware of any episode two, three,
4310640	4312600	or four stages coming back.
4312600	4313200	But who knows?
4313200	4315400	That could be for yet another expansion.
4315400	4316800	You know, I need to get back.
4316800	4318080	You know what, dammit, I am getting
4318080	4319920	so sick of some of the MMOs I'm playing now,
4319920	4321880	I think I need to give PSU another shot.
4321880	4323760	I think I need to give this game another shot.
4323760	4324280	I really do.
4324280	4325080	You want mine?
4325080	4325580	Huh?
4325580	4326160	You want mine?
4326160	4327160	No, I have the game.
4327160	4329360	Oh, I was going to burn mine.
4329360	4331160	I was thinking about, wait, how much
4331160	4335960	does Abortion of the Illuminous cost to download on Xbox?
4335960	4339640	I think it was 2,000 points.
4339640	4340880	I'm trying to remember.
4340880	4341720	That's not too bad.
4341720	4343040	That's about 20 bucks.
4343040	4344960	I don't know, I'll have to think about it.
4344960	4347640	You know what, there was some things about PSU I kind of miss.
4347640	4348880	It wasn't horrible.
4348880	4349640	So I don't know.
4349640	4351400	I miss PSO.
4351400	4353720	I heard there, you know what, we got news coming in.
4353720	4354640	Is this true?
4354640	4357080	That they're shutting off Blue Burst is going on.
4357080	4357580	No.
4357580	4359640	Yeah, so it's going to be the next thing.
4359640	4363080	The US Blue Burst servers are going down.
4363080	4365640	That's stupid, because I was actually
4365640	4367180	going to start playing that again.
4367180	4369680	Go ahead.
4369680	4371600	Yeah, one of the big questions right now
4371600	4376480	is, is the clumsy orbit and the rest of the GM team
4376480	4380060	going to try to get in contact with the Japanese team
4380060	4382760	to see if they can merge our characters over?
4382760	4384840	As far as I know, there hasn't been a response yet,
4384840	4386680	but they've at least passed the idea over.
4390960	4394400	Because I still have Blue Burst installed on my computer,
4394400	4398000	and I still have an account with active characters on it.
4398000	4403920	Yeah, and basically it shuts down in March.
4403920	4404920	Well, sorry to hear it.
4404920	4405880	How dare they?
4405880	4407880	All right, well, we've got to let you go here
4407880	4408960	as soon as we get some more calls,
4408960	4410800	but any last thoughts from our Phantasy Star
4410800	4412640	horror, Jonathan F?
4412640	4413480	Just one thing.
4413480	4415080	I wanted to announce a little project
4415080	4418280	I'm working on for the 20th anniversary of Phantasy Star.
4418280	4420080	Oh, go for it.
4420080	4423280	It's called Phantasy Star Dreams Forever.
4423280	4426280	And basically what it is, it's a remix album,
4426280	4428480	which basically goes through the history of Phantasy
4428480	4431200	Star from the original Sega Master System game
4431200	4433560	all the way up to Phantasy Star Universe.
4433560	4435800	And it's going to be a track list of about 108 tracks
4435800	4438280	that's going to basically be all developed by the community.
4438280	4440640	I'm just going to take more of a general manager position
4440640	4443880	on things here, aside from maybe just a couple of contributions.
4443880	4446920	And you can read up all the details at the website
4446920	4461380	phantasystarmun
4461380	4467360	online right now, if you want, I'll send you a link to it
4467360	4468360	through the chat.
4468360	4469360	Do that.
4469360	4470360	All right.
4470360	4471360	Please do.
4471360	4472360	All right.
4472360	4473360	Thanks you so much.
4473360	4474360	And have fun with Phantasy Star.
4474360	4475360	Maybe see you soon.
4475360	4476360	All right.
4476360	4477360	Always glad to be on the show.
4477360	4478360	All right.
4478360	4479360	Take care, buddy.
4479360	4480360	Jonathan was out here a long time ago.
4480360	4481360	Remember him?
4481360	4482360	He came out here a long, long time ago,
4482360	4483360	and he was talking about tech TV and stuff.
4483360	4484360	It was pretty good.
4484360	4485360	I'm glad to hear he's listening again.
4485360	4486360	All right.
4486360	4487360	Call us.
4487360	4492080	We're on Game OLR, or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
4492080	4493560	Let's get some last minute stories real quick.
4493560	4494560	Loki.
4494560	4495560	They're breaking the studio.
4495560	4496560	I know.
4496560	4497560	They're throwing away.
4497560	4499560	Look, the stuffed animals are there to look cute,
4499560	4500560	not to be thrown.
4500560	4501560	I don't care if all that is off.
4501560	4503800	One last minute story here real quick.
4503800	4511700	Apparently a dad has caught, or there was a dad who caught his son smoking pot.
4511700	4515480	So what he did was he put his son's Guitar Hero 3 Christmas gift
4515480	4519720	up on eBay to punish him.
4519720	4521360	That's news.
4521360	4522360	That is news.
4522360	4523360	That's smart.
4523360	4524360	That's great parenting.
4524360	4525840	That is wonderful parenting.
4525840	4527000	I love it.
4527000	4530000	It's actually still on eBay right now.
4530000	4531000	Nice.
4531000	4533000	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.
4533000	4534000	Who's this?
4534000	4535000	It's like Yuzaku.
4535000	4536000	Hey, Yuzaku.
4536000	4537000	What's on your mind?
4537000	4542840	Nah, just nothing chilling, you know, going through the gaming league as usual.
4542840	4543840	All right.
4543840	4544840	Let me rephrase the question.
4544840	4546600	How much do we owe this telephone call tonight?
4546600	4548320	I don't know.
4548320	4555720	The usual arrow smashing news, like how Supernova 2 is supposed to come out this month, and
4555720	4562600	the fact that Betsun is being dicks about holding EMUs back.
4562600	4567080	Yeah, I guess I've heard about Supernova 2, but I want to share with you my revelation
4567080	4568080	I had the other day.
4568080	4570760	Can I talk to you man-to-man a little bit?
4570760	4575200	Here's a revelation I had the other day, is that I was on Xbox Live and I was playing
4575200	4579160	Portal because I've been playing Portal a lot this week, and my buddy Shane used to
4579160	4584760	work at Konami, had a big part in DDR, and he doesn't live here in California, he lives
4584760	4589200	in Kansas, so we talk a lot over Xbox Live, and I noticed that he was playing DDR Universe
4589200	4593480	2, and he sent me a message on Xbox Live and he said, you know, Universe 2, blah blah blah,
4593480	4597360	and he was telling me his thoughts on the game, and I came to a realization, Zaku, and
4597360	4600080	that realization was, I'm kind of over DDR.
4600080	4603080	I really am.
4603080	4606360	There's not a lot that I care about that's going on in DDR anymore.
4606360	4612160	I'm not getting a boner over Supernova 2 like a lot of people are, and it's sad to say,
4612160	4616320	because obviously without DDR the show would not exist, without DDR I would not know Jamie,
4616320	4621680	without DDR I would not know Loki, without DDR I would not know Puppy, DDR has fucked
4621680	4626680	up my life in so many good ways, and bad, I mean, because there was that house I lived
4626680	4628800	in five years ago, but that's a whole other story.
4628800	4630960	In the real world, Rob edition.
4630960	4631960	Oh my god.
4631960	4632960	Oh wow.
4632960	4638680	That's not so bad, I mean, people grow out of it, people stay on, and move on with their
4638680	4639680	lives.
4639680	4642240	Zaku, I didn't grow out of DDR.
4642240	4643600	Just don't care about it as much anymore.
4643600	4647600	DDR has refused to change over the past five years.
4647600	4648920	That's the problem I'm having with it.
4648920	4652760	It's the same fucking game I played five years ago, and I'm just kind of done with it.
4652760	4657360	Yeah, but I mean, I know people, most of the people that I know that used to, you know,
4657360	4661160	they're like some of the best in the city, they don't play as much anymore, they pretty
4661160	4662560	much moved on.
4662560	4669200	I'm telling you, if Konami wants to bring me back, they just need to innovate the game.
4669200	4670320	It's possible.
4670320	4674320	They're trying to do it in little ways on the consoles, but they need to do it in a
4674320	4676400	major way in the arcade, and bring people back.
4676400	4679840	I mean, yeah, in the arcade they tried EMUs, but there's other factors that are holding
4679840	4680840	it back.
4680840	4685520	From what I hear, Betson is the reason why it's not happening in this country at all.
4685520	4694640	They don't believe that it's going to be successful, but I know Konami tries their damn hardest
4694640	4700600	and it's just other folks that are just being dicks about it, and they're just non-believers
4700600	4706040	and it's like they don't really give a shit about it.
4706040	4707640	I wish I knew more about programming.
4707640	4712120	I would want to design my own music game that was dancing that's not a rip-off of DDR or
4712120	4713240	In the Groove, or any of that stuff.
4713240	4715840	I have a lot of ideas floating around my head for the past five years.
4715840	4716840	I just wish I could do it.
4716840	4717840	What?
4717840	4720200	Why don't they make a Para Para game without Para Para music?
4720200	4724880	Because I remember when fucking Prestige used to fucking break out the Para shit, that was
4724880	4725880	kind of cool-looking.
4725880	4732320	Granted, you know, people make fun of it just like DDR, but it was a little different.
4732320	4736640	Or they could just add a Ticket Redemption game to DDR and there you go, it's going to
4736640	4737640	sell.
4737640	4740440	Oh, just throw it in a grave while you're at it.
4740440	4742440	Ever heard of that game Spider Stomp?
4742440	4749320	Those red buttons on the floor, and you get tickets out of them, and they light up.
4749320	4754800	Isn't that pretty DDR a little bit more than it already is?
4754800	4759360	Zaku, let me tell you this too, this is just going to make you cry even more.
4759360	4764920	I'm very sorry, but I have to admit, okay, when we went to John's Incredibly Shitty Pizza,
4764920	4767520	they have a DDR Supernova machine there, right?
4767520	4769280	And we were like, oh, Supernova.
4769280	4773600	But then I looked to my left, and I was like, oh my god, they have Jumpin' Jackpot!
4773600	4776640	And I ran over, and I played Jumpin' Jackpot!
4776640	4782040	Last time I played Supernova was yesterday, and then before that it was like, you know,
4782040	4783040	weeks.
4783040	4785760	I could go, I literally just threw up the line.
4785760	4789760	We saw the DDR machine, and Dan and I were like, because my husband was here with us,
4789760	4797040	we were like, hey look, it's the new, oh shoot, Airplane Game, After Burner.
4797040	4802000	And we spent most of the time either on the After Burner or on that ride that William
4802000	4803000	and I rode.
4803000	4808440	Not even that, I mean, I'm also getting into other arcade games like Wangan, I'm playing
4808440	4814640	more Initial D now, so I mean, and I'm playing a lot more other Hermione games, so I mean,
4814640	4818200	DDR is not really this much of an aspect in my life as it would be.
4818200	4822840	Sure, I mean, I try to go out to, you know, most of the tournaments, but as far as, you
4822840	4825520	know, trying to get better, it's the least of my worries right now.
4825520	4829720	Well see, I got the thing though, another thing there about DDR tournaments, that's
4829720	4835040	another thing that hasn't changed in years because it's already hit that plateau where
4835040	4838120	everybody's getting triple A's in the last couple years.
4838120	4843880	In the group, right, you know, R21, folks are able to innovate it by just creating pure
4843880	4846840	sight read tournaments through custom songs.
4846840	4852240	I just went to one yesterday where they had like about 18 songs, 18 brand new, you know,
4852240	4858040	18 sim files never before released until that day, and it was just a pure sight read, you
4858040	4860400	know, sight read tournament that just flexed out the ability to do that.
4860400	4864520	I can't get too excited about people putting sim files on a cabinet and then saying, ooh,
4864520	4866120	it's never been released before!
4866120	4870680	That's a little different than Konami saying, hey, look at this bitches, Supernova 3, yeah,
4870680	4874040	we're going to have the final round, that shit, now that's exciting, we got to wrap.
4874040	4878600	That's one aspect, you could argue with that, I mean, it's an aspect of, you know, how our
4878600	4885000	arrow smashers were, you know, for a better of a word, just, you know, continue the community
4885000	4888320	or they just, you know, they just stay active.
4888320	4891560	Here's the thing, and we got to get this call wrapped up so we can move on, take some more
4891560	4897280	calls, but I will always have a soft, warm, fuzzy, cute spot in my heart for Bemani in
4897280	4902080	general as well as DER for the many like good things the community brought, but if the game
4902080	4904480	doesn't adapt, it's going to die.
4904480	4910600	It is dying, currently, and the game has to adapt for it to survive, and I don't mean,
4910600	4919280	oh my god, I got sent pictures of that, my first DDR, like, if that's adapting, then
4919280	4920280	I want off the boat.
4920280	4925400	That's basically Konami's intent of trying to, you know, suck money out of the dry, and
4925400	4931360	eventually, remember, it's kind of like oil, it's not going to last forever, so, I mean,
4931360	4937200	it has to find an alternative means of just keeping the series alive by trying to please
4937200	4938480	as many people as possible.
4938480	4942800	I've got to let you go, buddy, Zaku, but thank you for bringing up Bemani, as you usually
4942800	4948240	do, and, you know, kind of allowing me to share my revelations with you.
4948240	4951040	I was going to bring up other things, but I had to get it out.
4951040	4952120	It's all right.
4952120	4953120	Next time, Zaku.
4953120	4954120	I'll talk to you next time.
4954120	4955120	All right.
4955120	4957200	We'll do one more call, if anything comes through.
4957200	4958200	877-GAME-OLR.
4958200	4961560	Yeah, that will play social commentary about oil, too.
4961560	4962560	No more stories?
4962560	4963560	Really?
4963560	4964560	Jamie, you have anything?
4964560	4965560	Today's boring week.
4965560	4966560	This is boring.
4966560	4967560	All right.
4967560	4968560	Well, then one more call, and we'll call it a show.
4968560	4972840	Have you seen, read the story that came up a couple days ago about that new PSP game
4972840	4975040	called, I think it's Potsipon.
4975040	4978160	It's like another, like a, it's like a music game where you have all these little armies
4978160	4979160	of creatures.
4979160	4982440	Is that related to Panledipon, which is, um, no, okay.
4982440	4983920	It's a little bit different.
4983920	4988560	It looks like, I don't know, it's a little stretch, but looks like LocoRoco, a little
4988560	4989560	bit.
4989560	4990560	Hmm.
4990560	4993560	You know, I'm actually looking in chat, and caller, just hold on just a minute, we'll
4993560	4996440	get to you in a second, because I picked up a call and I haven't acknowledged them yet,
4996440	4999600	but, um, let's see, I'm just looking at some interesting, because obviously a lot of our
4999600	5003180	hardcore listeners have been listening to us since the days where we were like nothing
5003180	5004180	but BomaniTalk.
5004180	5008520	GS191 says, the problem with DDR in arcades is basically that arcades are basically dead
5008520	5010660	and nobody wants to do shit about it.
5010660	5014560	The problem with DDR console releases is that the music is way too mainstream and alienates
5014560	5021180	the core audience, um, and Jaded says, because the concept is overdone, but the music concept
5021180	5022180	is great.
5022180	5027040	Um, and I, you know, I kind of, I kind of agree a little bit, a little bit, although
5027040	5031560	there is some type of allure to being able to play like popular radio songs on there,
5031560	5037640	I do think that DDR kind of opened my eyes, so to speak, to a whole other genres of music
5037640	5041520	that I didn't know existed before, you know, and some of those, you know, and who could
5041520	5047040	forget, I, I, I, I'm your little butterfly, who could forget how catchy that freaking
5047040	5050920	song was the first time they heard it, except for Loki, you're just Mr. Negative, or Boom
5050920	5056200	Boom Dollar, or you know, just a variety of music that was in that game, and that, I think
5056200	5060440	the Dance Maniacs series in general that kind of brought us a lot of music has been lost
5060440	5062440	over the past few years, which is kind of sad.
5062440	5066840	Because after, you know, after I started playing DDR for the first year or so, I actually started
5066840	5071440	going out and looking up these artists and finding what other music they had, and you
5071440	5077160	know, finding some good stuff that I still listen to, but it's kind of a, it just opens
5077160	5078640	your eyes a little bit.
5078640	5083640	Well, the whole, the going to the Dance Mania CDs, all they are now is just more rehashes
5083640	5084640	of the same.
5084640	5085640	Yeah.
5085640	5086640	They're not exciting.
5086640	5090920	But then I look at UltraMix 2, and that opened my eyes to the whole synth pop, and what,
5090920	5094120	you know, indie, different drum label stuff, and there's some awesome music on there, and
5094120	5097160	some of the bands that were in UltraMix 2 are like my favorite bands right now.
5097160	5098160	It's good stuff.
5098160	5101720	Anyway, I just want to say real quick, Rob D in chat says, I disagree with that.
5101720	5103560	I just think that DDR needs something new.
5103560	5107000	Releasing games with new songs just isn't going to cut it, and that's absolutely what
5107000	5108000	I'm saying too.
5108000	5109000	That's absolutely what I'm saying.
5109000	5111520	All right, anyway, let's, I'm sorry, I've made our caller wait.
5111520	5112520	Caller, are you still there?
5112520	5113520	Uh, yeah.
5113520	5114520	Hi, who is this?
5114520	5115520	It's GS68.
5115520	5116520	Hi, GS68, what's on your mind?
5116520	5117520	Sorry to make you wait.
5117520	5118520	Uh, yeah.
5118520	5126480	I've read about Super Smash Bros. Brawl online, and it's looking good.
5126480	5129480	I'm sorry, you read it, you're cutting out a little bit, you read about it online, and
5129480	5131400	it is looking good, or it isn't?
5131400	5132400	It isn't.
5132400	5134560	I just sent you a link to show you why.
5134560	5136160	Okay, let me look at this.
5136160	5139040	Why, and in your mind, why is this not looking good?
5139040	5140040	Is this about the friend codes?
5140040	5145240	Well, for example, if you get disconnected, and the CPU takes over, like, no one will
5145240	5149960	know that you disconnected, I mean, they'll keep on thinking that it's the same person,
5149960	5154960	which really bugs me, because now you can't tell if someone will have a, just plain computer
5154960	5155960	instead.
5155960	5156960	Yeah, but here's the thing, though.
5156960	5159800	I don't know if it's not really indicating that the person's disconnected, or that it
5159800	5163800	might say they've disconnected, but the computer player's still being, or the player is being
5163800	5165680	controlling the computer now.
5165680	5167240	That is, that is a very good point, yeah.
5167240	5169880	I read about that earlier this week, where basically, just to recap for those who may
5169880	5174240	not have heard, if you get disconnected, or your, you know, your Wii gets shut off, or
5174240	5177280	your power goes off, or whatever, in the middle of a match, you lose connection, the computer
5177280	5181080	will automatically take control of your character, so you're not having to wait, there's no buffer,
5181080	5182080	anything like that.
5182080	5185560	It's just that the computer takes over, but I understand what GSCCA is saying, is that,
5185560	5189480	you know, how does this, you know, if all the players disconnect, and you're fighting
5189480	5193560	the computer, how does online play differ from versus at all?
5193560	5200300	Yeah, exactly, and plus, since no one knows that you disconnected, like, there's no shame
5200300	5203480	in disconnecting anymore.
5203480	5206560	That is true, there should be a swift kick in the butt for when you disconnect.
5206560	5207560	But hopefully...
5207560	5210640	But it's gonna reflect on their, their ranking, their stats, right?
5210640	5217240	Actually, no, you won't, you won't see their names or anything, like, so you won't know
5217240	5218440	who you're fighting in.
5218440	5222480	I think that they're gonna address this stuff, I mean, this, what they've shown so far, they're
5222480	5226480	just kinda going over features, they haven't really delved into the details of what's gonna
5226480	5227480	be available on this.
5227480	5231800	I love it, Jonathan F. says, send in Mr. Resetti if they disconnect.
5231800	5232800	Brilliant idea.
5232800	5235920	And Mr. Resetti's in there, isn't he?
5235920	5236920	He is.
5236920	5237920	So, there you go.
5237920	5242400	But, you know, the Wii online stuff in general just kinda sucks, like, it really needs an
5242400	5248440	upgrade or a backbone or something, because, like, I think, I think Nintendo's, go ahead,
5248440	5253520	I think Nintendo's, like, trying to make online accessible for everyone, but in doing so,
5253520	5255680	they're oversimplifying online.
5255680	5259160	But let me tell you, okay, two stories for you.
5259160	5263680	Hey, I'm in Geometry Wars Galaxies, and Geometry Wars Galaxies has online leaderboards, which
5263680	5264680	is kinda cool.
5264680	5268080	You can go there, you register your name when you first go on, you can go look at the leaderboards.
5268080	5272840	But here's the thing, you can look at the leaderboards for the top ten scores or where
5272840	5275240	you are on the leaderboards, and that's it.
5275240	5279600	And you're just looking at a big list of names that mean nothing to you, because you can't
5279600	5284240	filter the list by the friends on your Wii, you can't filter the list by anything but
5284240	5287320	those things, so it's kinda pointless, it's kinda stupid.
5287320	5291820	I applaud Bazaar for trying to, you know, but I get the feeling they're just really
5291820	5295240	restricted by Nintendo's lack of an online mainframe.
5295240	5300280	Well, that whole thing with the leaderboards is the same for Ghost Squad and the new Trauma
5300280	5301760	Center as well.
5301760	5306600	Oh, I guess, well, yeah, I guess that's true, I forgot, Trauma Center has the leaderboards
5306600	5307600	too.
5307600	5308600	So.
5308600	5311960	At least I recognized a couple names on the leaderboards.
5311960	5312960	Did you?
5312960	5316760	Yeah, because they're from Game Facts, and I posted on Game Facts.
5316760	5317760	Gotcha.
5317760	5318760	There you go.
5318760	5320080	I feel sorry for you for posting on Game Facts.
5320080	5323440	Well, maybe there's some of that going on with Geometry Wars too, but my name on there
5323440	5328240	is Rob O-L-R. At first I was just Rob, but then when I saw what the leaderboards looked
5328240	5332180	like, I'm like, oh, I should be Rob O-L-R. But also, you don't automatically get your
5332180	5336040	scores posted to the leaderboards, you have to go in, connect to the Wi-Fi connection
5336040	5339420	and all that BS before your score finally gets posted.
5339420	5343680	That's what really, that's what kinda tells me that it's not Bazaar's fault or, you know,
5343680	5348240	the people that made the game, it's, you know, Nintendo's fault for having a weird online
5348240	5349240	system.
5349240	5350240	So.
5350240	5351240	Anyhow.
5351240	5353600	Anything else you want to share with listeners tonight?
5353600	5354600	Um, no.
5354600	5355600	All right.
5355600	5357920	Well, thank you very much for calling and listening to the show.
5357920	5358920	We appreciate it.
5358920	5359920	Have a good one.
5359920	5360920	You too.
5360920	5361920	Bye bye.
5361920	5362920	All right.
5362920	5367140	Well, I guess that is going to be it for the calls tonight, and that's going to bring our
5367140	5370640	show to a close as well, but thank you guys very much for tuning in and listening tonight.
5370640	5371920	Let's get to everybody's final thoughts.
5371920	5375960	Puppy, thank you for being here, and I hope you enjoyed the new studio and the...
5375960	5377840	It's much easier to breathe in here.
5377840	5379000	Yes, it is.
5379000	5382680	It's not nearly as uncomfortable as all cramming into an eight-foot space.
5382680	5383680	Exactly.
5383680	5385920	Well, any final thoughts, sir?
5385920	5391240	Um, I am not looking forward to the next three months of class.
5391240	5392920	Sorry to hear it.
5392920	5395720	Loki, anyways, what's your final thought?
5395720	5399520	I'm buying computer parts.
5399520	5404680	My final thought is I want pie again.
5404680	5406760	I say that every week, but I really, really do want pie.
5406760	5409160	I have frozen pies in my freezer right now.
5409160	5410440	Well, did you bring one with you?
5410440	5411440	I did not.
5411440	5412440	Bastard.
5412440	5413920	I also have Smirnoff's too.
5413920	5415440	Dark Soccer.
5415440	5416440	Was that you?
5416440	5418960	We were playing rock band last night, and you're like, yeah, I've just been having two
5418960	5419960	Smirnoff's.
5419960	5420960	This should be fun.
5420960	5421960	Yeah.
5421960	5422960	It was fun.
5422960	5423960	Yeah, I played rock band this week too.
5423960	5424960	It was a good time.
5424960	5425960	So we did a whole band last night.
5425960	5427800	Anyway, Dark Soccer, your final thought?
5427800	5431200	I just got a message on MySpace from some guy I went to high school with.
5431200	5434680	Was it somebody you want to hear from or not?
5434680	5440600	I messaged him once and forgot that I did it, and then like, you know, six months later,
5440600	5442600	he's messaging me back.
5442600	5443600	So I think it's kind of funny.
5443600	5445640	Now that is not checking your MySpace regularly.
5445640	5446640	Well, no.
5446640	5447640	It's too bad.
5447640	5448640	No.
5448640	5449640	All right.
5449640	5451320	Anyhow, I guess that's it.
5451320	5453400	We're going to call it a show.
5453400	5456520	Thank you guys so much for downloading us and supporting independent podcasting.
5456520	5457560	We couldn't do it without you guys.
5457560	5461240	If you like what you hear, please tell two friends about the program or two enemies.
5461240	5464440	We really don't care who it is just as long as the word gets out there because then we
5464440	5466120	can slowly take over the world.
5466120	5468120	We will see you next week.
5468120	5473400	Same bat time, same bat channel.
5473400	5474400	Do we know kind of anything?
5474400	5479580	Hopefully, we're going to do a game next week or something, kind of mix things up a little
5479580	5480580	bit.
5480580	5483720	I don't know if we're going to have any guests or anything in the studio, but we'll try for
5483720	5484720	you guys.
5484720	5485720	Yay.
5485720	5486720	So we'll see.
5486720	5488200	We'll see you next week, puppy, if you can.
5488200	5490480	I will try to if I'm not dead.
5490480	5491480	If you're not dead.
5491480	5492480	Why is my phone ringing?
5492480	5493480	I don't know.
5493480	5494480	All right.
5494480	5495480	Have a good week, everybody.
