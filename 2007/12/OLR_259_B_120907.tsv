20553	21394	Orange Lounge Radio
35112	35933	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
62651	63792	Super Smash Bros.
92020	96306	and they haven't really said exactly when, but it's going to be quarter two of next year.
96467	99411	So, you know, I don't know.
99571	103317	That's not good, I guess, but at least you're not waiting until Christmas of next year.
103597	107383	But aren't the Brits kind of used to getting screwed like this in a way, you know?
108150	119276	Um, maybe, but here's the thing though, I don't really see what they, I mean, other than changing the screen resolution and stuff that it renders at, you're not really localizing it for Europe, so.
119356	125579	That's what I want to know, like, are they having to, you know, produce extra copies and that takes so freaking long, or what is it?
125659	127440	What causes things to be so slow?
127460	127740	I don't get it.
127760	134664	I guess it's just, you know, changing some of the programming, because, I mean, if you think about it, a lot of the games that they get in Europe we don't get over here for a while, so.
136165	136925	Yeah, that kind of sucks.
137250	139791	MacMan says, Europe, the shaft of the gaming world.
139811	141831	You know, I know we have quite a few people over there that listen.
141851	142832	I'm sure aren't happy about this.
142852	145212	They've already gotten some games we haven't had over here yet.
145252	152134	Like, they have Endless Ocean already, which, you know, I'm sure given the opportunity, they would say, fuck Endless Ocean, let's get Super Smash Bros.
152214	157596	But, you know, they do get a few games before we do, so... I don't know.
157976	162077	RossDLUT in chat says, Loki, menus and stuff need to be made in other languages.
162297	162937	Any announcer?
163917	165978	Well, true, but I mean, still though...
166938	168419	for, like, some of the territories.
168459	171980	They can release it in the English-speaking territories and stuff like that.
172100	180384	And also a lot of the games like, you know, Excite Truck and that kind of thing, when they were putting them out, they develop them for, like, usually it's English, Spanish, and French, I think.
181285	185566	Especially, all the Nintendo titles seem to be English, Spanish, and French even when they come out over here.
185747	185987	Yeah.
186147	191489	Because, you know, Canada and Mexico, you need French for Canada and Spanish for Mexico, so, you know, it's kind of like a region.
191509	194711	So, I wouldn't think that that would, I mean, hold them back really too much.
195651	195771	Mm-hmm.
197253	203804	Alright, well, sorry Europe, it looks like you're going to get screwed there, but we'll tell you how fun it is.
204044	205106	No, I'm just kidding, that's so mean.
206881	216947	One, I guess, interesting kind of piece of news is that Nintendo is kind of, in a way, fessed up that they're not able to meet the needs of the Wii demand that's out there.
216987	223791	You know how the Wii seems to be, once again, for the second year in a row, the hot holiday toy that everybody's dying to get.
224551	228373	Nintendo has decided to pull ads for its Wii console.
228613	233196	And this story is out of the UK, actually, although I do believe it affects everybody.
233816	239600	Nintendo is actually going to be redistributing the commercials they had scheduled up until Christmas through the first quarter of 2008.
240120	249586	Nintendo spokesman said, "...we have been running the campaign all year round, but we want to take a responsible stance this Christmas and not fuel demand."
250665	257171	An ad industry insider said, Production has been stepped up to 1.8 million units a month and Nintendo still cannot meet the demand.
272470	277133	According to RawSteelUT in chat, eBay vultures are the only people buying the systems.
277494	281697	Sad but true, there probably are quite a few of those folks buying it.
281757	284679	RawSteelUT also says software sales are still pathetic.
284959	285439	You know why?
285639	286480	I have a theory why.
287062	290003	because most people that are buying that system are perfectly content with Wii Sports.
290643	298806	A lot of people are buying this just for Wii Sports, especially when you start to look at the older crowd and the more casual gamers.
299166	304907	That's the enabling game for the Nintendo Wii, and when it comes with the system, people don't think they need anything else.
305227	309089	I mean, back in the day when we were buying 8-bit Nintendo systems with Super Mario Bros.
309149	311949	and Duck Hunt, did we buy another game to go with it?
312050	312930	Not necessarily.
312990	313510	Not always.
313590	316091	Many kids found just that pack under their tree for Christmas.
316111	316911	You know what I mean?
318093	326745	But, I mean, granted, I would also humor probably the implied statement there that there's not a lot of must-have software on the Wii right now outside of maybe like Mario Galaxy.
326785	332613	Well, there's a lot of good games out there, but there's a lot more really crappy games, and it's really hard to tell.
333587	334147	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
363089	365030	Maybe it'll be a little bit easier?
365530	366010	Little bit?
366590	367210	But probably not.
367270	369971	You probably want to get online in the stock inventory.
370631	372652	Well, some of us waited in line.
373772	374272	That's true.
374612	379314	I bet all the Nintendo fanboys and fangirls waited in line day one anyway, and they're just looking at this and laughing.
379754	381874	Some of us just didn't care to buy a Wii.
383275	385195	That's true, and some people are like, eh, fuck Wii.
385395	388096	Oh, I should tell you, my mom told me she wanted a Wii.
390271	392372	You know, you're not the first person to tell me that story.
392772	398234	Which is, I'm just kind of saying, like, you know, I'm hearing a lot of people, their parents are wanting Wii's and getting into that.
398534	399454	But it's the sports game.
399914	402055	I know a parent that wants it for Wii Bowling.
402395	403316	Because she likes to bowl.
403996	407617	I thought it was funny because my mom almost played my old Nintendo more than I did.
408917	411979	And, you know, actually she probably played it as much as I did.
412799	415660	She wouldn't admit to it, but my mom was a gamer once.
416640	418621	And she had her Game Boy and played lots of...
419417	423901	Breakout, but, you know, now hearing my mom say, I want a Wii.
424041	424982	Can you get me a Wii?
425602	428765	I was like, I don't have $300, but we'll see.
430187	432168	Piker Uno has a very interesting perspective.
432208	436872	He's one of our listeners that lives over in Japan, and he says, I just bought one for my friend in the U.K.
438614	440215	There are plenty of Wiis in Japan.
441316	442317	So, kind of interesting.
442357	445160	I wonder what effect that's going to have, though, if you bought one for your friend in the U.K.,
446500	447240	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
474639	475379	Assault Suits Vulcan
497797	502641	Picaruno wanted to clarify something, speaking of the whole UK and how he's sending one to his friend.
502941	509345	He said modern PAL TVs are NTSC compatible, which I guess that explains that.
509365	509926	That's kind of cool.
512147	520633	But he says 99% of NTSC TVs are not PAL compatible, which he discovered when he went over to Japan from London, where he was originally at.
522455	526437	Oh boy, isn't high def supposed to be all the same no matter where you are?
526878	527098	It is.
527509	528989	Then we need to get on that quick.
529850	533151	Because these whole differing TV formats makes things very frustrating.
533251	542014	Well, just for example, when I was really big into my Gorillaz fandom, I was importing some of the DVD CDs.
543014	546175	And I would just run it through my laptop to the TV and no problem.
547595	549096	Yeah, so there you go.
549976	552597	Anyways, let's see here.
553593	559356	So for the US, you've got some good stuff coming out on the Virtual Console.
561537	564718	Including, you know, we talked about it last week, Pokemon Snap.
565418	566239	That's going to be coming out.
567219	569460	Baseball Stars 2 for the Neo Geo.
570941	573282	And also Ghosts and Goblins.
573942	574903	That was on the NES.
575383	576664	Hooray for Pokemon Snap!
577124	581726	I can't wait to download this and play this and send all of you pictures of Pokemon I take.
582768	585709	which means you and you and are you on my Wii?
585929	586549	You don't have a Wii.
586629	587269	Well, then screw you.
587309	597732	Well, I'm going to definitely actually give that a download but I won't say I'll be downloading Ghosts and Goblins because we've actually broke out our Saturn for our annual tradition and Dan was playing Capcom Collection Volume 2.
598332	598612	Nice.
598912	600013	This game is too damn hard.
600533	601473	It is too damn hard.
601493	602613	I'm not going to be downloading it.
602653	603334	Because guess what?
603354	604974	You play all the way through it and guess what?
605154	607555	You have to play all the way through it again to beat the game.
607835	608655	And then what do you get?
608915	609855	Congratulations.
609915	610956	The story is happy end.
610976	611976	You kick Satan's butt.
612603	612783	All right.
613763	617745	Well, anyway, I will definitely check out Pokemon Snap, so I'm excited about that.
617785	620266	This is something I'm kind of curious to check out as well.
620886	627228	A Ninja Party game is coming to the Nintendo Wii and the Nintendo DS in March of next year.
627728	629629	Ninja Reflex is the name of the game.
630029	630629	Thanks for watching!
650950	662593	Well, anyway, EA notes that ninja reflexes will center around doing challenges and testing your reaction time, which is very appropriate for a ninja game.
663773	664374	Here's a quote.
664994	666234	Millisecond precision.
667775	668655	Sounds like fun.
669775	670175	We'll see.
670555	673556	I hope you can calibrate it or something to give it that extra precision.
673616	673976	We'll see.
674936	677397	That just sounds sort of nifty cool.
677717	677877	Yep.
678377	678698	We'll see.
679938	680458	I'll check it out.
681411	687336	This is fairly, fairly interesting stuff for anyone who has a Wii.
687617	702289	If you join Club Nintendo and you would use your previous Nintendo website login, you can buy Wii Points for four stars for every Wii Point using your old stars from the Nintendo Club.
702309	705092	And this is actually Nintendo-Europe.com.
705773	708495	I don't know if they're doing anything like that in the U.S., but
708789	709409	I wish.
709709	715250	It was a loyalty program that they had going on where if you did stuff, you had all these stars.
715770	720471	So you can go through and use your points to buy games or go shopping or do stuff.
721271	723692	It's kind of nice that you can finally get something for it, you know?
724052	725392	Yeah, I think it's pretty cool.
726112	729513	As for all those people who saved up your stars, congrats to you.
733053	735734	Anyways, let's see here.
735794	737434	This is also kind of interesting.
737961	757475	Usually you would think Gamefly with rentals for games and stuff, but now they're offering Gamefly Tunes, which is a partnership with a company called Brand Racket, and they're offering the subscribers five free pre-selected songs to download each month.
758496	764280	And I guess that's going to highlight up-and-coming and established artists, and
765251	768513	Apparently, people that aren't subscribed to the service can download one.
769213	779177	And I guess this month, music including artists like RJD2, Thievery Corporation, Shadows Fall, OK Go, and Little Brother.
780738	783239	Hmm, that's interesting that they would be doing that kind of stuff.
783579	786601	And as far as I'm aware, I don't think that's actually any video game music.
786641	790702	Yeah, I actually downloaded some of those songs.
790943	793984	And, I mean, they are up-and-coming artists, so they aren't really...
795499	797600	Some of them are okay, others aren't that great.
798281	800703	I imagine that probably every month is going to be more of the same.
803305	807668	Well, I mean, OK Go was, they're in Rock Band, but, I don't know.
809130	809870	Free's good, I guess.
810951	811652	Yeah, Free's good.
811692	815935	I already have both of OK Go's other albums, and the rest of their stuff just sounds the same.
816696	818237	Just less entertaining.
819618	820899	And kind of boring in some cases.
821179	824302	I don't listen to a lot of the stuff that you kids are listening to these days.
825302	829166	You and your old radio discs.
829506	830087	80s Forever.
830107	832990	8-track tapes.
835332	836734	No, that's cassette tapes.
837935	838475	That's too old.
838615	844061	Let's move on to talking about something that could be all the rage in a couple of years, or very soon, who knows.
844548	855530	Apparently a patent was filed by Apple back in September of 2006 and now it has just come out to light because I guess these things take a while to hit the public internet.
855850	860691	Apparently there is going to be multi-touch technology in this game.
860791	870073	So apparently what it is basically, I mean obviously they already have the iPhone, but they want to apply this touch technology, the multi-touch thing, to gaming.
871153	875374	So they say, quote, this is being used for a game or a gaming application.
875914	886157	And, of course, we all know about the iPhone, but now we're kind of talking about that possibly this patent was actually filed to do gaming on the iPhone, possibly a music-based game.
886537	892139	But, I mean, this really doesn't come as much as a surprise because on the current iPods, they've gone into gaming a little bit.
892519	897240	So it just makes sense to me that on the iPhones and the iTouches and all this stuff, they're going to get into this as well.
897660	902243	Yes, and remember how wonderful those games are on the iPods already.
904024	906966	I'm being sarcastic, by the way, because they're not very good.
907066	910268	What about the one that came out from Harmonix?
911069	911929	Phase, thank you.
912070	915132	Phase was okay, but seriously, the rest of them sucked.
915712	916913	I mean, I don't know.
917173	925699	But then again, there's not much you can do with just a jog wheel, so having multiple touch screen stuff on there, yeah, that would be a lot better, obviously.
926179	926379	But
927478	934099	I wouldn't, I don't know, you're going to get as much gaming out of this as you are an N-Gage, so, seriously.
934639	938540	Well, I guess time will tell, but it is very interesting that that came up, nevertheless.
939280	955603	Always interesting are the emails that you guys send us every week at Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, and every week, Jamie dives in headfirst into our big old mailbag and pulls out a few of the emails that she likes and reads them for us here, live on air, and that's what she's going to do right now in our mailbag segment.
963922	965384	Email, email, email.
966985	976435	And just as a point of order, I will say that I have read every email that comes through and some are not being read, you know, on air because we got a bunch of them.
976856	978357	So I will read a few of these.
978657	981060	And one of them was sent from an iPhone and that makes me laugh.
983752	992577	Hey guys, I love the show.
992617	995158	You guys keep me going on the podcast at work.
995779	999381	I just wanted to say that I found a new game for me.
999501	1004483	I know you guys are not very big on the PS3, but you need to give it time and a chance.
1005324	1009186	I was on the PSN store last night and saw that they had added some new games.
1009246	1011507	I had never heard of a game called Wild Arms before.
1012432	1016814	I know you guys slash ladies may have.
1017254	1019815	It's a good RPG for the PSP.
1020396	1021696	Well, it was a PlayStation game.
1022637	1024758	Way better on PlayStation LOL anyway.
1024778	1027499	I love the show and keep it up.
1027519	1028539	Jamie, I love your input on the show.
1028559	1030740	It's always good to get info from the ladies and not from just us geek guys.
1039980	1043821	Gotta go back to work before the boss finds out I'm emailing you guys, LOLJK.
1045402	1045982	I'm telling.
1046342	1050543	I actually just sold my copy of Ratchet & Clank Tools of Destruction.
1050944	1056925	It's just... Not the full Ratchet & Clank, it's just I don't like the Ratchet & Clank series.
1057326	1064908	So it's not... I mean, that game's probably pretty good, but the person I sold it to loves it a lot more than I do, so... I don't know.
1064948	1067129	There's a lot of games, though, for the PS3...
1068573	1082844	I don't know, I was going to give Unreal Tournament 3 a chance, but for some reason, part of me thought that there was an actual good single player portion of that game, but it's Unreal Tournament and there's not, so I don't really want to buy it.
1084866	1090430	I don't know, there will be more stuff that comes out later on, it's just right now, there's not a lot of great games for it.
1091491	1092932	Not to say that there won't ever be.
1093689	1095690	Some interesting comments on chat on Wild Arms.
1095771	1097312	It's kind of polarizing the chat room.
1097332	1100034	Separat1215 said, Wild Arms was never a huge game.
1100414	1102135	I'm not surprised if no one knows what it is.
1102535	1105898	RossDLUT says, How the fuck has this guy never heard of Wild Arms?
1106538	1109520	Jonathan F. says, Wild Arms is a killer RPG.
1109620	1112302	Held up well against Final Fantasy VII, I think, in my opinion.
1112722	1114164	Wild Arms is just as it sounds.
1114224	1115484	A Wild West RPG.
1115825	1117646	Although it's not that at the same time.
1119047	1121709	So, there you have some comments on Wild Arms from the chat.
1122569	1123130	Any more emails?
1124016	1125057	No, none at all.
1125137	1125798	Yeah, there's some.
1125958	1126238	All right.
1127840	1128420	Next email.
1128460	1129461	Hey, folks at OLR.
1129581	1136308	I was just emailing to say that I was just about in tears at work from laughing so hard at Loki flipping out about one protesting for publicity.
1137129	1142374	I'm glad someone gets fired up about something and Loki offered up some radio gold.
1142904	1145505	You guys host a fantastic show, and I always look forward to listening.
1145525	1155691	Keep putting out fantastic shows, and us fans will be extremely saddened with the loss of this show because it really kicks the crap out of those, quote, other big-name corporate podcasts with its real enthusiasm and passion.
1157132	1157892	Ego++, thank you.
1158192	1162074	And again, this email is sponsored by the Olive Garden, home of the never-ending salads.
1162675	1163235	It's J-Rod.
1163295	1164556	Dude, the Olive Garden is awesome.
1165596	1167137	The Olive Garden is awesome.
1168418	1172300	Next, Dear OLR, I was thinking, would those Jot Guys act the same way...
1172992	1174193	If it said gay girl?
1202908	1203548	Don't get me started.
1226069	1227290	But good point brought up.
1227790	1229211	I would like to see an experiment done.
1229491	1235313	I would like to see the same person go back on to Halo 3 with the name gay girl or lesbian girl or something like that.
1235333	1243697	Because you say gay girl and a lot of folks get the stereotypical, you know, butchy girl who likes girls in their mind.
1243737	1246699	But lesbians, you know, is a more exotic word.
1247119	1253282	Lesbians is the, you know, lipstick wearing, you know, pillow fighting lesbians.
1254328	1254949	Porn star.
1255069	1259031	When I would tell you that most lesbians I know are in neither category.
1259632	1259872	Yeah.
1261853	1263974	So, continuing forward, shall I?
1265075	1265535	You shall.
1266256	1271199	Greetings, this is Kropotkin from the Kropotkin and Hendrix Game Review Show.
1271319	1272100	Sorry, I'm getting tongue-tied.
1273120	1281686	While listening to your show last week, second part, I noticed that Loki casually dismissed Sensible Soccer as of little to no interest to anyone, and then Sky and Rice Princess began to laugh at its name.
1281886	1282206	Oh, dear.
1283246	1290868	I had to count to ten before writing this email as one should never write an email in anger for yes, such a dismissive attitude filled me with both fury and despair.
1291509	1298171	Sensible World of Soccer, aka or Sensi, is part of the holy trinity of British video game titles that cannot be slighted.
1299051	1309274	It was an all-time classic footy game made by Sensible Software, hence the name, that built on Kickoff 2 title from back in 1989 on the Atari ST and Amiga.
1309926	1312867	To see it arrive on Xbox Live Arcade is nothing short of wondrous news.
1313227	1316889	To put it into perspective, try to imagine someone saying Super Mario 3 is a bit meh.
1317789	1322471	And that is what you did last week as far as your British listenership were concerned.
1322971	1328953	Oh, and in case you're wondering what other two games are in the Trinity, they are Speedball 2, already on Xbox Live Arcade, and Paragroid.
1329577	1332398	If you want to know more about these three games, search on wiki.
1332759	1334479	It has some great pages for all three games.
1334519	1335760	I've actually heard of Paradroid.
1336921	1340983	Keep up the good work and just be careful over games that originate from the British Isles in the future.
1341443	1345025	I mean, you might even start saying things like Lords of Midnight are a bit overrated.
1345165	1345805	Not a good idea.
1346745	1357831	So basically what Kropotkin's trying to tell us is that Guardian Legend is to Orange Lounge Radio as Sensible World of Soccer is to all of the UK.
1358900	1361122	Is that kind of what this email is to summarize?
1361382	1363724	That's the general... I see.
1363764	1366826	Well, we are sorry for poking fun at your sacred game.
1366946	1368327	Or he was just saying Loki was wrong.
1369108	1370609	Which a lot of our emailers like to do.
1370629	1373952	Dude, okay, no offense, but... I mean, uh-oh.
1374012	1378956	You know, even... Okay, I'll give you, you know, yeah, Super Mario Bros.
1379156	1380657	3 may be not the shit.
1380797	1383279	And to be honest, it was the shit at one time.
1384540	1386001	But times have changed, okay?
1386021	1386101	Okay.
1386502	1391426	Sensible World Soccer may have been a great game at the time, and it still may be a great game now.
1391626	1392547	But you know what, though?
1392567	1395029	I ain't gonna download it.
1395850	1396871	You know why I'm not gonna download it?
1396951	1398372	Because it's a soccer game, for one.
1398873	1402636	I don't play sports games, and I definitely don't play soccer games.
1403194	1405035	and two, it's like an Amiga game.
1405295	1406216	So, no thanks.
1406236	1408137	I'll check out the demo and if I like it, I'll buy it.
1408157	1409177	That's what I do with most games.
1409858	1411559	I'll be sensible about it.
1411799	1418262	Back in the day, I used to play Blades of Steel and stuff like that, so I have tried games and stuff like that.
1418302	1419083	It's just not my thing.
1419483	1421804	And I'm not saying that you're wrong for downloading it.
1421824	1423945	I'm not faulting you for doing that, but you know what?
1424106	1425426	I sure as hell am not downloading it.
1425927	1428268	But you're wrong for being British, is what we're trying to say.
1428448	1429168	I'm not British.
1429188	1429929	I'm just kidding.
1430129	1430449	No.
1430549	1431069	Never mind.
1431129	1431830	I'm just teasing.
1431850	1432070	Rob.
1432731	1433011	What?
1434273	1437335	You remember, though, what I went crazy about finding at the store Friday night?
1438356	1442841	Super High Impact, which is the only American football game that I like, ever.
1444742	1447445	I like Tecmo Bowl on the Nintendo.
1447505	1448626	That's my favorite.
1448686	1450548	Super High Impact on Super Nintendo was my thing.
1450788	1454512	But I also played, what was it that was on Super Nintendo?
1454532	1455553	Was it Mario Striker?
1456153	1456694	Wasn't that it?
1457276	1458557	No, Mario Stalker's the new one, isn't it?
1458597	1459497	No, that's the new one.
1459577	1461218	Oh, that's probably like a new sequel or something.
1461238	1464479	It was an old one on Super Nintendo, another soccer game.
1464499	1465540	I used to play that all the time.
1466740	1468841	Uh-oh, the chat room's requesting my British accent.
1469021	1469342	No!
1469542	1470462	You better go to next email.
1470622	1471042	No!
1471242	1471763	Next email.
1472363	1476865	Oh, I think I'll be logging on to Xbox Live this week and downloading some Sensible World of Soccer.
1476925	1477505	Sensible!
1478826	1479306	Cheerio!
1479326	1480247	I'm more Scottish.
1481127	1483928	Okay, see, I'm not doing that shit, so I mean, come on.
1483988	1484989	And they're getting mad at me.
1486906	1487226	Whatever.
1487246	1487906	Yeah, but I'm cute.
1488727	1489347	Uh-huh.
1489627	1490688	Yeah.
1490928	1491928	Hey, OLR.
1492289	1495190	I've been listening to your show for over a year now, and I think it's the best.
1495990	1496150	Aw.
1496951	1499452	My question is mainly for Loki, but others could chime in.
1499492	1500733	Well, thank you for your permission.
1501273	1504975	I bought a PSP Slim and need to know how to install custom firmwares.
1505855	1508316	Do I need Pandora's battery and how to?
1510697	1515039	Your show is awesome, great, and with a PSP, I will hopefully be listening live more often.
1515660	1515980	Thanks.
1516644	1544197	Ryan Yeah, you do need Pandora's battery in order to install custom firmware on there and there's instructions online on how to do it and you actually have to create a different Pandora's battery than the one that they use for the fat PSPs but basically it involves you making the standard Pandora's battery then you patch the file with some other thing and then once you've done that you run the Pandora's battery on the system and then you can install custom firmwares
1545438	1547460	Don't ask me how to do it because I didn't know at the time.
1547500	1551383	I had a very stupid walkthrough on how to do it.
1551923	1554485	And it took me about three times before I finally got it right.
1554586	1558569	So it's not easy, but it's not super difficult.
1558589	1560250	Do you have to mod your PSP?
1560470	1561912	I mean, Jesus, just play the games.
1562692	1563873	Me, I don't!
1565294	1566796	Hey, I have to mod everything.
1567176	1568017	Everything!
1569418	1571519	There's not anything that I don't break open.
1573101	1573781	Except for my DS.
1573801	1574502	I haven't done that yet.
1575330	1576492	I'm working on it right now, though.
1576812	1582321	We broke open my old Game Boy Advance to put an afterburner in it.
1582950	1585151	That's different because it really needed that.
1585191	1587393	I mean, that really enhanced the damn Game Boy Advance.
1587433	1588593	My friend did that for me for my birthday.
1588613	1598019	But I'm just saying, you know, the PSP, yeah, I installed, when they were first out, I installed the stuff that let me play Kid Icarus on the PSP so I could go, hee, hee, hee, I have Kid Icarus everywhere.
1598279	1599060	But now it's kind of old.
1599440	1600761	And so I just, I don't care anymore.
1600781	1601841	I don't care about modding anymore.
1601861	1604203	I haven't hacked my iPhone, though, and I'm not going to.
1604223	1605003	Not my thing.
1607465	1608225	Next email.
1608285	1610646	DMN says, Loki modded his penis.
1610827	1611407	I checked.
1613211	1613831	Game consoles, okay.
1613851	1614412	Next email says words.
1626423	1627744	Hey, Loki, DarkSakura, and Sky.
1627764	1631708	I just wanted to thank you guys so much for helping me get through a really hard first semester at college.
1632148	1633729	Looking forward to the next podcast.
1633989	1637733	It kept me going and helped me look around for some fellow gamers that need play.
1637753	1645199	So I quickly found a whole bunch of Wii players, and I've been having fun with Mario Strikers since I'm one of those more social gamers, although I don't play online a lot.
1645719	1649903	Anyway, keep up the good work, and once again, thanks for making this transition all that much more manageable.
1651272	1652473	All the best, Cliff R.
1677083	1677644	Dr. Burst
1698820	1699381	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1717239	1720402	I'm glad that the price changes on live through 65 did not kill you.
1720902	1723864	This show has helped me get over two pages out of three.
1724445	1725125	Good job, guys.
1725165	1725626	Keep it up.
1726126	1728908	Over 9,000 cups of coffee for the win, Dr. Burst.
1730049	1730369	Nice.
1731931	1733272	We've gotten four times better.
1735353	1741378	We must have been really bad before to be four times better now because I would say we're only about... We're like on the line right now.
1742138	1742459	You know what?
1742599	1745281	I lied because there's... Well...
1746648	1753914	It's an article that Rob with 2B's linked to that I actually think is pretty cool.
1754114	1757556	It's from Endgadget, as soon as it loads.
1757657	1764101	But it's Sega protecting the Dreamcast trademark but not doing another console.
1764482	1766023	Oh, God, that whole debacle.
1766063	1766943	I forgot about that.
1767944	1768945	Well, if it'll ever load.
1769700	1785704	But basically, Sega is saying that they are going to keep that trademark so that they can, I guess, protect their rights in the Dreamcast name, but they're not going to be doing any...
1786573	1792120	I want to know how the hell someone jumped to that conclusion that they're doing a Dreamcast 2 from them renewing the trademarks.
1792481	1794844	How did that rumor even start?
1795204	1796887	Because that kind of seems stupid to me.
1797467	1800952	They're quoted as saying they have no plans to get back into the console business.
1800972	1802034	Which is no surprise.
1802054	1803796	When I first read that rumor, I'm like, yeah, right.
1804488	1808170	Yeah, right, they're going to put out a Dreamcast 2 right now when the market is crowded.
1808590	1811071	I just don't see Sega getting back into consoles anytime soon.
1811132	1818355	I mean, let's face it, sorry Sega fans, but the last few offerings from Sega have not been all that, even in the console market.
1819096	1821197	So they've got a lot of catching up to do, you know what I mean?
1821637	1823138	Before they start thinking about a console again.
1823278	1825219	Okay, we've got one last email.
1825639	1826960	Sorry, I was blinking.
1827340	1827580	Fine.
1828100	1828921	It says boobies!
1830407	1830947	I'm not joking.
1830967	1832187	The first word in it is boobies.
1832308	1833128	Is that from DMN?
1833248	1833448	No.
1833708	1834028	Oh, wow.
1834048	1834608	From the doctor.
1834888	1835268	Oh, okay.
1836189	1836989	LOL.
1837209	1839429	I'm thinking a lot of LOLs in my emails.
1839590	1840010	What is up with that?
1840070	1840870	I love you guys.
1841010	1844271	Anyway, I'm going to try and buy some 360 before Christmas.
1844791	1847012	Thanks for the idea, Sky and Loki, the doctor.
1848592	1853333	Send me a TARDIS so I can, you know, go elsewhere and else when.
1854053	1857234	And now here, Rostio UT actually has a really good idea here.
1857314	1859655	He says, I can imagine, for once, ha ha ha,
1860726	1861246	No, just kidding.
1861526	1866147	He says, I can imagine they'll just repackage a flashback-type console for Dreamcast games.
1866587	1868247	Now that I could see happening.
1868787	1871928	That is a sensible world of Dreamcast to me.
1873748	1875569	By the way, it was Mega Man Soccer I was trying to think of.
1878609	1879329	Let's see, what else?
1879349	1881690	I'm getting lulled today in boobies.
1882130	1883490	Somebody else had a sensible joke.
1883550	1883810	Oh, yes.
1884390	1889811	Actdeft said when we go to the college campuses, it could be OLR, the Sensible World of Podcasting Tour.
1892114	1894795	We should have that contest.
1894975	1895975	Pay for us to come see you.
1896695	1898175	I like that idea.
1898235	1899135	Pay for our vacation.
1899596	1902256	Here's our new contest.
1903496	1905077	Pay for ORR to come to your town.
1906337	1910378	And they can make fun of your town and then maybe show some people how to do podcasts.
1910398	1912998	And we'll record our podcast in your town if you pay.
1914378	1916199	But not at your house because that would be creepy.
1919383	1920664	And you might not have good internet either.
1920724	1921344	Yeah, exactly.
1921384	1926667	I mean, my God, the show's breaking our internet at this house, and we kind of tried to prep for it.
1927007	1928108	All right, end of mailbag.
1928148	1930229	Let's get to some more stuff.
1930269	1933411	If you want to send in an email, give us some ego++.
1933451	1934051	We always love that.
1934091	1935432	Mailbag at orangeongeradio.com.
1935732	1937293	Or some ego-minus-minus.
1937894	1940455	I think Jamie skipped some of the ego-minus-minus this week.
1941216	1942136	I skipped a...
1944446	1948748	reminder of manners addressed to one of our three that isn't you or me.
1951048	1953069	I was looking forward to that email because it was kind of funny.
1953429	1954070	Do you want me to read it?
1954190	1955710	Yes, read it because it's funny.
1955810	1957291	You'll see why in a minute.
1957611	1958971	I have to open the email box again.
1958991	1959251	Hold on.
1959271	1959572	All right.
1960572	1966154	We're going to give her a minute because there's an email that's criticizing Loki that I actually found kind of funny and I want her to read it.
1967170	1968711	and it's funny because it's true.
1968771	1969831	It is so fucking true.
1970091	1973293	And I've been listening all night long tonight and it is completely true.
1973373	1976854	And so that's why I want to... I know Loki's like, what the fuck did I do now?
1976874	1977634	Okay, here we go.
1977654	1978615	I have to go in the old mail.
1978755	1980515	Alright.
1980535	1983076	Hold on, we'll get some email loading music here.
1983116	1985377	All criticisms of me are true, so whatever.
1985397	1991540	Of course, when you start playing the music now, the email starts to load, so...
1992653	1995575	Old mail.
1995615	1999517	Let's be critical of Loki for another week.
2000317	2001778	I can't wait to see.
2001918	2003238	I know, because Op 11's running.
2003939	2005740	Damn you, Op 11!
2006200	2008121	Op 11's going to shut off.
2008201	2010262	Yeah, yeah, Loki's like, oh, take your time.
2010542	2010942	Here we go.
2011362	2011783	Oh, hooray.
2012743	2014524	And this is from Mario.
2016073	2019135	Oh shit, you know that Mario's calling you out now.
2019615	2023337	Yeah, there are other people in the world named Mario other than the video game character.
2023357	2027740	I will not say last names on the air.
2028660	2035624	Loki, I find that you are very rude to your co-hosts and audience when you cut them off with your standard introduction, anyways.
2037045	2040807	Saying anyways after someone states that whatever is said is not important.
2041331	2044832	What everyone says is important, even your thoughts and comments.
2045132	2048594	Learn to stop saying anyways after anyone's statements except your own statements.
2049934	2050975	Anyways, I don't really care.
2054496	2055816	It is true, though.
2055836	2059558	No, he just... There's people that interrupt me all the fucking time.
2059578	2062499	You'll hear me going, hey, hey, I'm not done talking yet.
2062599	2063679	Hey, listen.
2064180	2065160	Hey, listen.
2066100	2067541	Hey, listen.
2068749	2068909	Hey!
2069009	2069609	It's over!
2070370	2071110	I'll say anyways.
2071130	2071771	It's over!
2071851	2072471	Well, please.
2072711	2073231	No, it's just funny.
2073532	2079175	No, it's just, you know, we're just poking fun at you because I don't think you really mean it to be rude, but it's been kind of your transition word.
2079515	2082636	Like, you know, we've been working on our transition, you know, going from one story to another.
2082676	2085958	We try to be smooth, like, you know, oh, we're going to go from one wee story to another wee story.
2086278	2090040	When Loki's ready to go on a story, it's like, okay, anyways, we got this game coming out.
2090060	2092121	Oh my god, Rob, your light's just seizured.
2092862	2093142	Did they?
2093846	2097287	Yeah, they're just sitting here and we're on and all of a sudden BLINK!
2097627	2100248	It's because he has them on that one where they cycle.
2100728	2102569	Yeah, they're on the cycle one where it goes through anything.
2102589	2104289	They cycle, you know, with the baby on.
2104449	2106510	Well, I just happened to look over there when they were on.
2106530	2108711	Alright, anyways, can we get back into the gaming news now?
2108851	2110751	Definitely we can get back into the gaming news.
2111171	2112192	And I'll stop shopping.
2115353	2118534	I want to get a little bell and every time Loki says anyways I go BING!
2119534	2120774	Weren't you going to get a bell for something else?
2120794	2122775	I know, there was something else I was going to get a bell for and I never did.
2123447	2124908	Oh well, because I'm lazy.
2125568	2130289	So Rock Band ain't coming out in Canada until the 28th.
2131190	2133050	Sucks for you guys, but guess what?
2134851	2141133	The problem is they don't have enough guitars and instruments and stuff to go around and it doesn't help that their first batch of them also sucked.
2141694	2147476	Because they're having to send all the Canadian guitars out as replacements for all the broken American ones and you know it's true.
2148216	2148616	Probably.
2150317	2151277	So, yeah.
2153570	2154451	No Rock Band for you.
2181815	2188538	I guess apparently this was going to be a UMD project, like an actual full game, and there was actually going to be licensed music and videos.
2188878	2192559	Apparently the Sugar Babes, which is a British band, was going to be involved.
2193179	2196080	But they decided to scrap that idea, thank God.
2196560	2202083	And what they did instead is that now for this $5 game, it'll actually run off the MP3s that's on your PSP.
2202603	2205624	So it's very similar to that iPod game that just came out, Phase.
2206644	2207745	Well, it doesn't look the same.
2208085	2208545	To me...
2209443	2215685	The game itself looks like one of those cutscenes, or not cutscenes, but one of the parts of Guitar Room Man.
2215745	2219665	Not the part where you're moving the analog stick around, but the part where all the notes are coming in towards the center.
2219946	2222626	When you are doing the attacks.
2222806	2223566	Yes.
2223586	2226087	That's what this looks like to me.
2226667	2227547	Oh my god, you're right.
2228288	2232128	Now you can't get that on the PlayStation 3 store for whatever reason.
2232229	2235049	Maybe soon, but right now you can only get it on the PC store.
2235309	2235809	So there you go.
2236930	2238190	It looks very plain.
2239740	2246004	Oh, I guess Tigerclaw actually linked a YouTube video of our buddy Bobby playing beats.
2246464	2251028	So I'm curious about this, and since the Op 11's done, we should actually have bandwidth now.
2251128	2251868	I want to look at this.
2252729	2253149	Let's see.
2254390	2255811	Alright, there's a little watermark.
2255891	2256812	Okay, here we go.
2257412	2258133	Let's take a look at this.
2260575	2261535	That looks kind of cute.
2261595	2261936	Let's see.
2262156	2263377	Let's get into actual gameplay.
2264377	2265598	Oh, he's playing to his own show.
2265638	2266139	That's cute.
2270595	2271456	That's something else.
2271836	2274057	I don't know, the game itself doesn't look that exciting, though.
2278080	2278681	Ah, there you have it.
2279721	2280442	Nice job, Bobby.
2281082	2282643	Good promotional piece, I gotta say.
2282783	2283324	That's a good one.
2284384	2285325	Anyhow, that's it.
2285405	2286186	PSP Beats.
2286446	2289008	Not something I think I'm gonna run and grab my PSP for.
2289448	2291209	I don't know, it doesn't look that exciting to me.
2292270	2292810	You know what?
2293651	2294511	I'm not gonna download it.
2295652	2298094	However, this is something I do want.
2298686	2300547	And by do want, I mean do want.
2302868	2303268	Finally.
2303888	2305729	Luminous is now available on the PC.
2305869	2307370	Yay!
2308290	2310531	My God, what else are they going to put this thing on?
2310571	2311231	The N-Gage?
2312231	2313092	Or is it already there?
2313992	2318434	I mean, the PC is like the last platform I think this game is coming out on.
2319815	2322095	You've got a skin editing mode.
2322195	2322716	You have...
2324415	2341979	Online score ranking, it's going to be $19.99, and there is a pay-per-play on a... You can pay-per-play, or you can use a free version that has ads all over it.
2342819	2343659	Does it have Shinen?
2343679	2344720	That's all I really care about.
2345080	2346680	I don't know, but I'll get it.
2348885	2351887	All right, you let me know, and then I'll download it if it has Shinin' in it.
2352007	2352968	I'm going on there right now.
2353849	2354289	Shinin'.
2355990	2356291	Anyways.
2360814	2362575	Yeah, because I didn't care what you were talking about.
2363636	2368480	I hope it has Shinin' on it, because I'm not going to play the game unless it has Shinin'.
2371222	2373023	Sad you're home with Bell, so fuck off.
2373844	2373944	Um...
2375339	2376200	Axiom Overdrive
2404195	2408938	And that's going to be heading, I know, to live arcade here pretty soon.
2411099	2420805	Some of the nominees here, they've got best web browser game, including Iron Dukes, Globus.com, and Triacnid.
2422926	2426708	Some of the games I've liked that I played here, Excellence in Visual Art, Clean Asia.
2427028	2431251	Like I said, it's a good shoot-em-up game if you like Warning Forever.
2432652	2436634	There's also another one that you might like if you like Warning Forever, which is called Battleships Forever.
2436654	2439356	It was inspired by that game, and it's another shoot-em-up game.
2440076	2441337	So definitely worth checking out.
2441477	2447740	And also, if you want something to waste some time on, also check out Crayon Physics Deluxe.
2448380	2451342	They have Crayon Physics, which you can play for free as well.
2451782	2454904	Fret Nice, also fun if you've got a Guitar Hero controller.
2456044	2457485	Highly recommend that game as well.
2457952	2459053	But anyways, just check it out.
2459193	2464857	It's at www.igf.com slash 02finalist.html
2465876	2471358	and there's a bunch of links to free games and also go to all those sites you'll notice that there's also more free games on there as well.
2471658	2489384	You know I'm glad we really did that story tonight because I think sometimes we don't give independent games enough loving on this show and for you know as much as we say rah rah rah support independent podcasting we should be talking more and more about independent games so we definitely should all take an effort to kind of check out some of these winners and talk about them on the show.
2489424	2493225	Definitely and if you're also interested there's links this is the 2008
2495612	2496553	GameTapIndia Awards
2524083	2526768	Roboblitz and Everyday Shooter won that as well.
2526988	2536484	So a lot of these games, play them now because you'll probably see them on an online service like the PlayStation Network or Xbox Live Arcade soon.
2538456	2566606	Alright, well something you might be seeing making a comeback soon are the franchises MechWarrior, Shadowrun, and Crimson Skies because Jordan Weissman has this new startup company Smith & Tinker and he basically has licensed back the electronic entertainment rights to those franchises back from Microsoft and basically these franchises were originally developed by FASA and then Microsoft had it in 1999 and they recently dissolved
2568326	2569027	Um, that.
2569107	2572910	So, no really plans to further these franchises.
2574031	2578414	By Microsoft, which is probably good news, because Shadowrun really didn't get a lot of love.
2578975	2582938	And, uh, you know, kind of seemed like these series were kind of done for.
2582998	2585260	But they are a lot of fans, especially Shadowrun.
2585280	2588262	You look at that, you know, especially the old school versions of Shadowrun.
2588682	2594467	Lots of people love those games and are very excited at this news because, you know, maybe this is a sign that...
2595731	2599174	I used to play Shadowrun Tabletop, like the original Shadowrun, which was RPG, actual.
2624994	2625815	D&D Style Gaming
2656162	2661086	This is actually put out by, I think, let me see.
2661647	2663028	I'm trying to find the list that put it out.
2663288	2666791	Next Gen, 2007's Japan's Top 20 Games.
2667171	2668492	So we're not talking sales-wise, though.
2668512	2674157	We're talking like, it's December, here comes everybody's Top 10 list, you know, and all that stuff, right?
2674417	2676779	Well, I've got a Top 20, so I'm just going to sort of skim through it.
2676859	2677039	Sure.
2677440	2681843	Okay, on number 20, DS Literature Companion, which was on the DS.
2683405	2683545	And...
2687023	2693809	I don't see how that would be interesting, but they were doing these cartridges for different classic Japanese novels.
2694730	2696612	So that you know more about it.
2696932	2698333	I guess like Cliff Notes or something?
2699975	2700495	I don't know.
2700515	2705960	19 was Bladestorm for PS3 and Xbox 360 put out by Koei.
2706921	2710644	More Dynasty Warriors-ish game.
2710664	2713867	18 was Vision Training Flash Focus on Nintendo DS.
2714468	2730492	Wild Arms XF on PSP number 17, number 16, Game Center CX on Nintendo DS, which is by Bandai Namco, which is, it's actually based off of a TV show.
2732932	2734713	And let's see, moving forward.
2736773	2741034	On number 15 is Trustee Bell, which was Eternal Sonata.
2742795	2743615	I like that game a lot.
2743835	2744035	Mm-hmm.
2745403	2751427	14 is face training to where you use the DS camera to mimic a face.
2753729	2754730	That sounds stupid.
2755210	2755550	I know.
2755951	2757792	It's sort of like how to smile a certain way.
2757832	2759033	It's one of the top games of the year.
2760554	2763216	13 was Ace Combat 6, which I don't see why because it's kind of boring.
2763236	2772283	12 was Tsuburashiki Kono Sekai It's a Wonderful World on Nintendo DS.
2772443	2774045	That's the one by Square Enix.
2774747	2775747	That's pretty awesome looking.
2776148	2780209	I like how the article says the battle system plays something like DDR for kids with ADHD.
2782510	2783430	That's interesting.
2784090	2789272	Eleven, Treasure Island Z, The Adventures of Zack and Wiki on Wii by Capcom.
2792093	2793094	Moving forward.
2794614	2795014	Come on.
2795535	2795935	There we go.
2796775	2800176	Ten, Crisis Core Final Fantasy VII on PSP.
2800677	2801717	Like, I have to explain that.
2802764	2804486	9.
2802805	2804486	Legend of Zelda The Phantom Hourglass 8.
2806348	2809591	Armordyne, which was on PlayStation 2.
2811052	2814856	Another one of those mecha fighting weird strategy RPG things.
2816517	2814856	7.
2817058	2825746	Yushin no Kusei ni Namaikita on PSP, which is put out by Acquire.
2826847	2828188	Acquire gave us Tenchu, by the way.
2830241	2835722	Six, No More Heroes, which we were just going over during our break.
2837783	2839343	Very interesting looking little game.
2840804	2843184	And then the last few, the top five.
2843844	2846865	Number five is Lost Odyssey, Xbox 360.
2849226	2851846	I've been hearing some not so great things about Lost Odyssey.
2851886	2853667	I'm very curious to check it out when it comes out here.
2856047	2857408	I'm kind of of two minds about it.
2857448	2858188	I'm thinking about it.
2859312	2874562	4 is Super Mario Galaxy, 3 is Wii Fit, 2 is Professor Layton and the Curious Village on Nintendo DS, put up by level 5, and number 1 is Pac-Man Championship Edition on Xbox Live Arcade.
2875603	2876284	Interesting.
2877684	2878485	Interesting choices.
2878585	2880907	We've actually, that game gets a lot of play in my house.
2881207	2881347	Hmm.
2882585	2883967	I'm actually curious about this.
2884167	2886288	We were posted a link in chat from Rosteel UT.
2886328	2889031	It's a commercial for face training straight out of Japan.
2889111	2890292	So this ought to be a hoot.
2891713	2891893	DSで顔のトレーニング 口角と頬を引き上げます 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 両方の眉を引き上げます
2919333	2922636	My god, it looks like it's like, like, it's creepy.
2922696	2929421	That commercial's creepy because it makes it seem like, you know, we will be absorbing your brain in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
2932907	2937110	It's strange to teach everybody to smile and make expressions the same way.
2937330	2941093	Are they trying to imply that the Japanese people do not have emotion?
2941333	2943514	That's racist.
2944195	2948738	That they need to look like everybody else.
2949018	2953641	It's basically a trainer for pod people so that we can't see who they are.
2954201	2955062	That's really what it is.
2955122	2956563	That's a strange looking game.
2956603	2956943	Alright.
2959369	2960390	CompUSA Liquidation Sales
2984702	2988363	Make your way down to your local CompUSA for some sweet deals on old games, I'm sure.
2989064	2992845	Except for the fact I looked, and there's no more CompUSAs in Sacramento.
2992865	2993665	They got rid of all of them.
2994306	2995926	The closest ones are in the Bay Area.
2997447	2999668	And I'm not driving all the way over there just for some cheap games.
3002169	3003209	Sorry, CompUSA.
3003269	3004630	Nice knowing you when you were still around.
3004850	3011012	We bought one of our computers from CompUSA one time, like way back in the day, with its whopping one meg of RAM.
3013171	3013792	www.darksakura.com
3020697	3022838	Dr. Phil Burned a Lot of Bridges with Gamers
3047243	3050504	She was really into there, and I want to say for a time worked for the company.
3050544	3051464	She may still even be there.
3051564	3051904	I don't know.
3052444	3053704	That's why we haven't heard from her in a while.
3053724	3055224	Maybe she needs to go on the Dr. Phil show.
3055404	3057685	I don't know.
3057885	3062266	Well, apparently this girl, this 13-year-old girl, Lexi, she spends all her time on there.
3062626	3068587	She had a boyfriend in there, and they would make out on their bed and everything.
3068607	3072287	She had real feelings for this guy, I think.
3073388	3075568	Sadly, I saw the show.
3077674	3077994	What?
3078715	3080036	You watch the Dr. Phil show?
3080076	3082137	My wife watches the Dr. Phil show.
3082157	3083658	Oh, and it just happened to be there.
3083718	3085980	You couldn't, like, you know, go to the other room or anything?
3086340	3094886	I had already been in the other room the entire day, so, you know, I have to come out sometime and spend quality time with my wife and also eat dinner.
3095151	3098575	Well, then, did you have fun watching the Dr. Phil show?
3098836	3100598	No, because we always make fun of Dr. Phil.
3100618	3102240	We always mock him.
3102460	3104243	I'm Dr. Phil, okay?
3104643	3107707	He's a lot like Mr. Mackey.
3107727	3111512	He's like, yeah, I'm Dr. Phil, and you should stop doing that.
3112034	3120798	Well, what's interesting is what Dr. Phil, and you may think that he's going to say something kind of narrow-minded and stupid, but he actually ends up having some pretty decent advice.
3121279	3126921	He says, quote, because he actually had the CEO from there come on the show and kind of defend.
3126941	3128362	So he got all ends of it.
3128642	3131284	He said, quote, the problem is not with the game.
3131364	3133044	The problem is the use of it.
3133405	3136906	The game is very creative, and it's there for you to use or abuse.
3137387	3138227	Are you abusing it?
3139454	3140455	Yeah, and she said yes.
3140715	3142076	She's like, yes, I am abusing it.
3142116	3143957	And it's like, oh, okay, that was easy.
3144217	3144818	And here's the thing.
3145458	3148280	Mom limited play to four hours a day.
3150161	3152423	And so Dr. Phil says, four hours a day?
3152503	3153223	It's ridiculous.
3153644	3156265	Mom, you've got to step up and shut this down, okay?
3156766	3163490	Once she's at a point where she can play the game instead of being absorbed in the game, okay, then perhaps she can attempt to get back to it.
3164471	3166212	That was the official advice from Dr. Phil.
3166272	3167573	So it actually seems like...
3168311	3178139	That was good at telling the parent that the parent needs to pull the plug on the game and get the kid to do something else and stop passively accepting it.
3178199	3180180	Well, the parent is the one paying the credit.
3180641	3187026	This has a monthly subscription fee, I believe, where you can buy money in this game using your credit card.
3187066	3192590	Well, the kid does not have a credit card, so stop giving her money, you moron.
3194102	3201487	Wasn't this also the episode of Dr. Phil that the lawyer of no name was claiming that he was supposed to be invited to and never went through with it?
3203248	3204168	Eh, who cares about that guy?
3204408	3205809	Yeah, he's gonna be disbarred at the end of the day.
3205829	3206530	I'm so over him.
3207530	3208051	So over him.
3209111	3209852	Yeah, he's gonna be gone.
3210232	3210552	Yay.
3211753	3217196	Well, there is a new games rating system.
3218557	3221699	A campaign to be launched for renting the games.
3221779	3222740	There's a group...
3223302	3237726	A couple of the Delaware political folks are hanging out with the ESRB and trying to bring out new public service announcements that these new ratings are supposed to be adhered to or whatever.
3239327	3239787	You know what?
3242588	3243588	Can't they look at the box?
3244315	3246476	Parents don't know the rating system, I swear.
3247016	3253840	True story, last night I'm at Walmart and I'm looking at the Wii games because I kind of still want to get Trauma Centers.
3253880	3256622	I was kind of looking at how much they're charging for it because I was there to get some other stuff.
3257162	3262585	And there's this parent and the kid is playing Xbox 360, the little demo kiosk, right?
3262885	3264646	And he's going, I want this game, I want this game.
3264706	3266067	And she goes, well, what's it rated?
3266707	3267748	Okay, good question.
3267768	3268568	She says, what's it rated?
3268888	3270049	And the kid goes, RP.
3270549	3272070	And the mom's all, what's that mean?
3273523	3274364	What does RP mean?
3274424	3274844	I don't know.
3274964	3277125	RP is not even on the list.
3277625	3278386	It's rating pending.
3278726	3278806	Oh.
3278986	3279747	RP is rating pending.
3279767	3281307	They do have it on the ESRB poster.
3282208	3284389	In fact, that's what will fill the wall.
3284429	3286030	I've got some ESRB rating posters.
3286050	3287731	That would be a good thing to fill the wall with.
3287831	3289132	So if any parents watch our show, remind them.
3289152	3290072	I have like hundreds of them.
3290352	3297336	And me being the nosy fucker I am, I jumped in there and I said, I was like, it means rating pending.
3297376	3299097	It means like, it's like a movie that hasn't been rated.
3299117	3300278	I'm just thinking RPGs.
3300298	3300558	Oh, no.
3300578	3301018	Yeah.
3301934	3303595	Well, that's the thing.
3303655	3304595	I've been saying this for years.
3304655	3306216	It should mirror the movie system.
3306416	3311217	If it said R or PG-13 or not yet rated, people would know what that meant.
3312018	3313238	And I said, well, what's the game?
3313338	3314699	And she said it was Naruto.
3316559	3318540	And I told her, I said, Naruto is based on a cartoon.
3318560	3320301	The worst thing you're going to see in it is cartoon violence.
3320341	3320881	It's teen.
3321421	3322041	It's rated teen.
3322061	3323081	It's rated teen?
3323162	3323502	Why?
3324202	3325542	Because of cartoon violence.
3325562	3326523	Because it's beating up.
3327163	3327363	Oh, okay.
3328145	3329526	I told her, I'm like, ah, it's a cartoon.
3330006	3331287	It's fine for your seven-year-old.
3331307	3332847	Oops!
3333568	3339551	Well, you know, that's actually the same thing I think that the anime community has been sort of arguing against people for years now.
3340111	3342692	That just because it's animated doesn't mean it's for kids.
3343753	3344033	Oops.
3344953	3345954	Have you seen Perfect Blue?
3346114	3349395	But I said the worst thing you're going to see in it is cartoon violence.
3349595	3350616	Or boobs.
3351036	3352657	They do not have boobs in Naruto.
3352857	3354438	They do not have boobs in Naruto.
3354478	3354758	Yes, they do.
3356064	3357085	I would like to see you let your boobs.
3357105	3358566	This is on Cartoon Network, I mean.
3358706	3361067	The sexy nojutsu, yes, you do get boobies.
3363309	3363609	All right.
3364410	3364770	Ha ha.
3364830	3367011	If that were the case, that show would be a lot more popular.
3367031	3369113	They are cloud-covered boobies, but they're still boobies.
3369433	3371194	Okay, yeah, yeah, here's the thing.
3371254	3376138	Look, and GS68 is like Sky, you know, the Japanese anime cartoons, not necessarily Kid Safe.
3376198	3378439	Okay, it wasn't La Blue Girl the game, okay?
3379099	3379700	It wasn't that.
3379760	3380701	It was freaking Naruto.
3380741	3384203	That's rated E. Which is on a rated EC for early childhood.
3384998	3386760	Naruto's on freaking Cartoon Network.
3386820	3387320	I know that.
3387400	3389322	I didn't think it would be that bad.
3390623	3392345	Oh, well, so what's the worst that happens?
3392665	3394327	Some seven-year-old kid sees boobies.
3394467	3395227	I mean, come on.
3399331	3399852	Moving on.
3401573	3402394	Anyways.
3403455	3403715	Ding.
3405757	3406618	I did that on purpose.
3409020	3409760	So, anyways.
3410962	3411442	I love doing that.
3412475	3414996	A watchdog group, of course, the Nymph.
3415716	3419017	They gave the game industry AC.
3419317	3423578	Of course, each year they put out their video game report card.
3424519	3428340	You know, this is like one of those things... WHO THE FUCK ARE THESE PEOPLE AND WHY SHOULD I CARE?
3429140	3435162	Well, they are the National Institute on Media and the Family.
3435862	3444869	They basically will do those wonderful undercover stings where they'll see if people will sell them M-rated games and stuff like that, or their kids and whatnot.
3447311	3454597	Really, my thing is, who gives a shit if they're rating so... You know, if I rated the industry an F, would people give a shit that I'm rating an F?
3454677	3455638	No one really cares.
3455678	3463364	This industry, or watchdog organization, excuse me, this watchdog organization sounds like the group in Footloose that told the townspeople they can't dance.
3464159	3464919	Something like that.
3465900	3468580	But apparently they've conducted a lot of research.
3469461	3478424	They found that 52% of the parents claim to use the ESRB rating system, but 72% know little or nothing about the rating system overall.
3481204	3482625	72 plus 52 does not equal 100.
3483445	3484265	I'm confused.
3484405	3487907	But, you know, people use it despite the fact that they don't know anything about it.
3488687	3492548	That has... So that game's rated M. I like the letter M!
3493055	3493695	Go, son!
3493755	3494375	You can buy it!
3494576	3496396	I mean, is that how they do it?
3496416	3497237	I mean, seriously.
3498017	3500498	Everybody cut loose, put loose.
3500678	3509281	Apparently, undercover shoppers that were under the age of 18 were able to buy M-rated games at nearly 50% of the time.
3511122	3512422	But really, here's the thing, though.
3512882	3515743	It's store policy not to sell M-rated games to minors.
3515903	3517904	There's no law that says they have to do that.
3518004	3518944	So what's it matter?
3519545	3520785	In fact, I would tell them that.
3521704	3522404	To their faces?
3522905	3525366	Yes, if I was a person, they'd be like, why?
3525386	3528048	You sold me an emery to game and I'm under 18.
3528348	3530930	I'd be like, so?
3531110	3533931	Loki, you should join one of these watchdog organizations just for laughs.
3535432	3536793	Maybe like an undercover report.
3537193	3539335	What really goes on in these watchdog organizations?
3540896	3544578	I would like to see a watchdog organization for the watchdog organizations.
3545774	3546474	I like that.
3546715	3547515	I'm going to rate them.
3548295	3549636	I think this is a fabulous idea.
3549716	3551757	So what would we call our watchdog organization?
3552538	3552998	Hmm.
3553198	3553478	Hmm.
3553798	3554499	You think about that.
3554579	3555019	Chat room.
3555199	3556540	I'm putting that challenge to you guys.
3556940	3557120	Ooh.
3557380	3557480	Ooh.
3557681	3557861	Ooh.
3557921	3558081	What?
3558141	3558401	I know.
3558581	3558901	I know.
3559522	3561823	Their nymph, I'll be nympho.
3564905	3565485	I like that.
3566065	3567646	I don't know what the O would stand for.
3571248	3571808	Overseer.
3571828	3572289	There we go.
3572309	3572929	That'll work.
3574178	3577580	I'll be the National Institute on Media and Family Overseer.
3579181	3579641	Nympho.
3580562	3580802	Love it.
3581702	3582643	That's beautiful.
3584864	3586925	That's one of the greatest insights to come.
3586965	3590888	And, like, the years I've been doing this radio program, that's one of the greatest, I'll tell you.
3593069	3593369	Anyhow.
3593489	3594270	That's lovely.
3595790	3596391	Oh, Rosteel, you too.
3596411	3597191	You did it, too.
3597551	3598312	I like this.
3598452	3599252	You did it.
3599332	3599753	You did it.
3599773	3599893	What?
3600113	3600833	Oh, forget it.
3601434	3601774	Who cares?
3602367	3606628	Rostio UT says, The Institute for a Media Whore Free America.
3609169	3612330	Dark Tetsuya says, National Institute Media Family, OLR.
3613330	3615631	Frisbee says, OLR is watching you poop.
3617131	3617911	I don't know about that one.
3617931	3618771	I don't want to watch that.
3618791	3621952	What the hell is wrong with you people?
3622693	3624233	OLR is watching you poop in a tube.
3624313	3625013	That's gross.
3626334	3630515	I mean, Loki watched those two girls poop in a cup, but that's something completely different.
3630535	3631635	I think a lot of people watch that
3632205	3636391	Anyhow, moving on, let's talk about EVE Online.
3649785	3652728	What happened is that there was a new update that went out.
3652768	3654870	It was the Premium Trinity patch.
3655550	3658313	And it went out a little earlier this week, I think about Thursday-ish.
3658633	3668521	And what happened is that it added a bunch of new features to the game, but the patch also removed the boot.ini file off of your Windows XP.
3669822	3670583	Hooray!
3671644	3673986	Which kind of fucks your operating system.
3675953	3678014	And there was a quote from the official support page.
3678094	3684857	Quote, if you are only using the classic client or installed the premium client using the full premium installer, then you are not affected.
3685237	3689899	If you upgraded the classic client to the premium client using the content upgrade, then please read on.
3690339	3694060	Check the root directory of your hard drive and see if you have a boot.ini file.
3694220	3695861	If so, then you are not affected.
3696753	3704259	The file is normally hidden, so you need to click Tools, Folder Options, View and Select, show hidden files and folders, and uncheck Hide Protected Operating System.
3704299	3705080	I'll just be able to see it.
3705440	3707341	You can also blah, blah, blah, blah, so on and so on.
3708122	3710884	What the fuck were you doing touching that file in the first place?
3710944	3711885	That's what I want to know.
3712686	3713726	Like, how did that happen?
3714487	3721593	Like, seriously, there's a part of me that goes, some pissed off bitch in this organization, like, threw that in there just to, like, fuck with these guys.
3722073	3722834	That's so sad.
3722874	3724135	I bet she's planning on quitting.
3725256	3725476	And so...
3726178	3731202	Program, delete, boot.ini Bye, my two weeks are up.
3732122	3733744	Let me know how the program works.
3735165	3735805	For real.
3735925	3736546	I quit.
3738067	3740188	Frisbee says, uh-oh, SpaghettiOs.
3740368	3742150	I'll take my severance pay now.
3745592	3747353	Have fun storming the castle.
3747754	3747974	I mean...
3749113	3750713	Yeah, don't touch the boot.info.
3750733	3757335	But at the same time, Windows XP should, like, you know, if you're going to delete a file like that, it should go, are you sure?
3758115	3763296	Like, Windows XP should have a little dialog box that says, when you delete this file, you will fuck your whole computer up.
3763697	3765597	Are you sure you want to delete this file?
3765677	3767517	And a little picture of Bill Gates going, no, no, no.
3767537	3768478	I bet there is something.
3768998	3777540	But, like, even if it is, like, if this person now that I'm imagining is going, click yes for are you sure.
3780976	3783417	Rob D says it sounds like the SimCopter bug.
3783497	3784758	Do you remember the SimCopter bug?
3785178	3797204	Where it was one of the first appearances of same-sex relations in a game because a gay programmer actually programmed it in there that guys would kiss guys on this guy's birthday and then left the company.
3797644	3798244	That's great.
3798985	3800085	It was more than that, I think.
3801306	3803087	There was a lot more than kissing going on there.
3804133	3805353	Please, this is a family show.
3805393	3806133	We don't need to go there.
3806393	3807554	Right, this is a family show.
3808354	3810594	This is a dysfunctional family show.
3811194	3815275	All right, we're going to open up the Skype line and welcome the extended members of our dysfunctional family.
3815315	3818136	That would be you folks, the listeners.
3818156	3819036	1-877-GAME-OLR.
3819156	3820996	Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
3821277	3828218	And I am dying to see how this works tonight when I only have half the strength out here on the Wi-Fi network out in the garage and we're trying to stream a show.
3829198	3831519	This could be very interesting, so we'll see what happens.
3831559	3832119	Again, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
3834261	3834721	Who are you?
3834741	3835422	What's your name?
3862463	3864164	Because you probably bought a case mod.
3865325	3865746	Probably.
3867147	3867827	Or maybe eBay.
3867847	3868828	I can't remember anymore.
3869128	3869809	My memory's fading.
3870229	3875453	They did sell though a new case for the Dreamcast that you could make that was clear.
3875754	3878476	And they also sold a bootleg of the Hello Kitty one too.
3880317	3881298	Does Rob got that one?
3882098	3882619	Do I have what?
3883578	3884759	The Hello Kitty Dreamcast?
3884979	3886461	No, I do not have the Hello Kitty Dreamcast.
3886561	3893427	I was actually very excited because I found that I have two Dreamcasts, but then this guy named Loki said that one of his is his.
3896209	3896750	What's up with that?
3896990	3898912	Why am I hearing myself?
3900333	3900774	Is that better?
3900954	3901374	Sorry about that.
3901394	3901855	Yes, much better.
3901975	3902235	Thank you.
3906509	3908010	GameTap, GameTap's on my mind.
3908030	3910571	I got Fremont from GameTap, very nice of them.
3910832	3914554	You've realized they released a Mac client to their beautiful GameTap?
3914574	3914854	No.
3921454	3922475	Oh, it's one of the ones that's getting removed.
3922635	3923155	Well, here's the thing.
3923736	3925817	We got linked the Wikipedia article.
3925837	3926117	Here it is.
3926538	3933463	The game game controversy when a designer inserted sprites of shirtless himbos, male bimbos, in speedo trunks.
3933503	3934804	I love that term, himbos.
3934884	3936345	I'm going to use that in a sentence every day.
3936985	3941488	In speedo trunks who hugged and kissed each other who appear in great numbers on certain dates.
3941889	3949394	Their fluorescent nipples were drawn with a special rendering mode usually reserved for fog-piercing runway landing lights.
3949813	3953054	So they could easily be seen from long distances in bad weathers.
3953634	3964738	An unintended emergent behavior of the code caused hundreds of himbos to swarm and crowd around the helicopter where they would be slashed up by the blades and then need to be airlifted to the hospital, which earned the player easy money.
3965218	3968819	The Easter egg was caught shortly after release and removed from future copies of the game.
3970380	3971700	And then the designer was fired.
3971740	3972221	He didn't leave.
3972261	3973201	He got fired.
3973521	3974821	Here's how you access it, too.
3975142	3979063	Apparently, if you go into the game, you go into career mode, hit control, alt, X.
3979605	3987748	Warp Me to Career 29 Control Alt X 300 guys in bathing suits will appear For fun, since there are no military helicopters in the game, fire tear gas at them.
3987768	3988248	That's just wrong.
4005362	4006382	All right, sorry, Ravenstaff.
4006682	4007802	I agree with that.
4007842	4014384	I think it was disgruntled someone, but who the fuck is messing with the freaking IDF file to corrupt your computer?
4014484	4019445	They ever thought to them that it doesn't start your operating system.
4019585	4021505	So how the hell do you find it in the first place?
4021525	4024105	Somebody needs to explain funny, not funny.
4024385	4027386	Deleting my boot INI file, not funny.
4027766	4028946	Himbos, funny.
4029906	4032747	So if you're going to do something disgruntled, make it funny.
4034795	4035855	Yeah, but you can't find it.
4035955	4040957	They said their thing is like, you can't get into the operating system, how do you find it?
4040997	4041517	You're screwed.
4041857	4043638	You have to use a disk, basically.
4044638	4047019	Anyhow, what was the other thing you wanted to call in about tonight?
4047659	4049379	It's about the Mac client of GameTap.
4049800	4052961	There's a brand new Mac client.
4053461	4055381	I need to check it out.
4055461	4058182	Do you still have to have the Intel chip in your Mac?
4058282	4058742	Yes.
4059343	4060523	I can't use it.
4061823	4062103	Lame.
4063024	4064004	But it's much lighter than
4064545	4068607	More games run smoothly on the Mac and on the Windows side as well.
4068647	4070427	Everything runs great on both sides.
4070467	4073388	But now you can't run the Windows-based games on the Mac, right?
4073408	4074789	They just took that category out of it.
4074829	4075629	No, no, that's gone.
4075949	4076309	I figured.
4076370	4080391	The Windows games, so you lost like 800 games on the Mac side.
4081371	4084993	Well, but you still get all the arcade games.
4085033	4086413	You get the Genesis games.
4086553	4087214	Oh, well, that's cool.
4087434	4087634	Atari 2600?
4088871	4089211	DOS.
4090112	4091073	Oh, you get the DOS games?
4091613	4092835	You get DOS games as well.
4092855	4094176	Well, that makes sense, because of the chip.
4094196	4094756	Well, that's cool.
4095137	4095677	Well, good.
4095737	4095937	I'm glad.
4095957	4101142	There were a lot of people really pissed off about the fact that there was no GameTab Mac client, so good for them making good on that.
4102843	4104505	I'm going to add one thing to that.
4106066	4108208	I got a free month from them, so I'm happy about that.
4108588	4109689	Who'd you have to blow to get that?
4110870	4111211	No one.
4111231	4116015	I just said I had problems with the PC version, and I'm like, well, we'll just add another free month for you.
4117639	4119821	Dang, I'm going to call GameTap and tell them I have some problems.
4121602	4124665	Yeah, my boot.ini file got deleted by your client.
4125065	4125706	Let's see what happens.
4126286	4129229	All right, RavensDolphin, any other quick thoughts before we let you go and get to somebody else?
4130197	4132057	No, but I think that sucks.
4132097	4140680	How do you get a game like that and just boot a game and you go like, well, I got it, and then you restart your computer and you're like, what the fuck?
4140860	4141440	What happened?
4141760	4142980	Yeah, it sucks to be those guys.
4143500	4146601	I'm really sorry to all the EVE Online players who got fucked over by that one.
4146621	4147361	It sucks to you.
4147481	4148341	All right, I'm going back to Godfather.
4148661	4149222	All right, see ya.
4150602	4152983	All right, if you want to give us a call, 877-GAME-OLR.
4153043	4155083	Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
4155103	4157784	We'll also get to some last-minute stories, and then the show is done.
4158344	4158804	Hooray!
4160074	4163396	I mean, aw, that's sad, because then there's no more OLR till next week.
4163416	4164077	What are you going to do?
4164978	4168660	All right, phone's not ringing just yet, so let's get a couple quick last-minute stories.
4169361	4170501	Oh, I lied, here it comes.
4171762	4173023	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
4174244	4177066	Hey, Sky, it's Jonathan F., your fantasy star whore.
4177286	4179748	Well, hello, our fantasy star whore, how are you?
4181129	4183591	I'm doing just fine here.
4183671	4186913	Are you playing The Abortion of the Illuminists, or whatever that's called?
4188388	4189849	Ambition of the Illuminist, actually.
4190089	4190410	Ah, I see.
4190450	4194973	Yeah, you can find me running around in a rappy called Brightstar.
4195914	4201018	Anyway, I wanted to just call in and let you know about some of the big stories that are going on right now with this.
4202239	4205701	The first big one is that there's actually another expansion coming out.
4206602	4209665	But the thing about this one is that it's for the PSP only.
4210485	4213207	And funny enough, it's named... Wait, the PSP?
4213708	4215349	Yeah, PSP's getting a fancy Stargame.
4216417	4218039	So wait, this can't be an expansion.
4218059	4218999	This is a whole new game, right?
4219019	4219500	It's a whole new game.
4220881	4226867	Well, basically what it is, it's going to expand upon the story that's already there and add some new missions into it.
4228268	4234013	And the real funny thing about it is that when you condense it from its original name, Phantasy Star Portable, it makes PSP.
4235714	4236475	Oh, there you go.
4236495	4237716	So PSP on the PSP.
4239238	4239638	Exactly.
4240319	4240739	There you have it.
4241840	4242040	Exactly.
4242060	4242620	In fact, go ahead.
4242640	4243120	I'm sorry, go ahead.
4268638	4268998	Oh, okay.
4269618	4286002	Basically, what's coming back in this version, actually, starting in just a couple of short weeks here in Japan, or over in Japan, I mean, there's going to be an event called the Maximum Attack G, whereby they are bringing back some of the original Phantasy Star Online stages.
4287222	4288582	Now, that could be kind of cool.
4289542	4291523	I know.
4291763	4293003	They're going to bring back Cave...
4293829	4296951	and, you know, what were the names of those stages in the old one?
4296971	4298693	They had Cave and, what, Ship?
4300154	4304977	Yeah, the Forest, Cave, Mines, and Ruins, they are all confirmed at this point, pretty much.
4305157	4306178	Wow, that's kind of cool.
4308400	4314744	Unfortunately, I'm not aware of any Episode 2, 3, or 4 stages coming back, but who knows, that could be for yet another expansion.
4315364	4316745	You know, I need to get back.
4316805	4321629	You know what, dammit, I am getting so sick of some of the MMOs I'm playing now, I think I need to give PSU another shot.
4322358	4323698	I think I need to give this game another shot.
4323759	4324039	I really do.
4324059	4324499	You want mine?
4325099	4325279	Huh?
4325519	4325899	You want mine?
4325939	4326640	No, I have the game.
4327180	4328060	Oh, I was going to burn mine.
4328220	4333722	I was thinking about, wait, how much does Abortion of the Illuminous cost to download on Xbox?
4336043	4339744	I think it was 2,000 points.
4339764	4340404	I'm trying to remember.
4340845	4341305	That's not too bad.
4341385	4342025	That's about 20 bucks.
4342985	4343225	I don't know.
4343245	4343946	I'll have to think about it.
4345126	4345546	You know what?
4345626	4347507	There was some things about PSU I kind of miss.
4347907	4349568	It wasn't horrible, so I don't know.
4349588	4350408	I miss PSO.
4351391	4353653	I heard they're, you know what, we got news coming in.
4353693	4356194	Is this true that they're shutting off Blue Burst?
4356655	4356795	No!
4356855	4358696	Yeah, that was going to be the next thing.
4359637	4360237	The U.S.
4360297	4362559	Blue Burst servers are going down.
4363059	4364160	That's stupid.
4364200	4367082	Because I was actually going to start playing that again.
4370184	4376669	One of the big questions right now is, is the, is Clumsy Orbit and the rest of the GM team going to,
4377099	4377840	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4405854	4411538	All right, well, we've got to let you go here as soon as we can get some more calls, but any last thoughts from our Phantasy Star whore, Jonathan F.?
4412658	4413419	Just one thing.
4413459	4417982	I wanted to announce a little project I'm working on for the 20th anniversary of Phantasy Star.
4418282	4419503	Oh, go for it.
4420283	4433031	It's called Phantasy Star Dreams Forever, and basically what it is, it's a remix album, which basically goes through the history of Phantasy Star from the original Sega Master System game all the way up to the Phantasy Star universe,
4433570	4438233	and it's going to be a track list of about 108 tracks that's going to basically be all developed by the community.
4438273	4443517	I'm just going to take more of a general manager position on things here aside from maybe just a couple of contributions.
4444017	4448200	And you can read up all the details at the website, fantasystarmonthly.com.
4449280	4449681	Very nice.
4449741	4450741	Well, good luck on that project.
4450761	4452763	That's a pretty big project you guys are taking on.
4453163	4459587	And since we are a radio station, send us some of the upbeat radio-friendly tracks when it's done and we'll put some in rotation on the station.
4460731	4462133	Well, there's one online right now.
4462193	4464817	If you want, I'll send you a link to it through the chat.
4465237	4465578	Do that.
4466819	4467060	All right.
4467080	4467380	Please do.
4467440	4467701	All right.
4467721	4468462	Thanks to you so much.
4468902	4470264	And have fun with Phantasy Star.
4470785	4471426	Maybe see you soon.
4471446	4471686	All right.
4471826	4472828	Always glad to be on the show.
4473028	4473268	All right.
4473308	4473689	Take care, buddy.
4476951	4478933	Jonathan was out here a long time ago.
4479414	4479914	Remember him?
4480075	4483479	He came out here a long, long time ago and he was talking about tech TV and stuff.
4483499	4483979	It was pretty good.
4484279	4485341	I'm glad to hear he's listening again.
4485741	4490827	All right, call us, 877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
4491968	4493510	Let's get some last minute stories real quick.
4493710	4493850	Loki.
4493870	4495232	They're breaking the studio.
4496112	4497473	I know, they're throwing those stuff.
4497674	4500456	Look, the stuffed animals are there to look cute, not to be thrown.
4501077	4502178	I don't care if all the lead is off.
4502198	4503379	One last story here real quick.
4503799	4511346	Apparently a dad has caught, or there was a dad who caught his son smoking pot.
4511647	4517752	So what he did was he put his son's Guitar Hero 3 Christmas gift up on the eBay to punish him.
4519514	4520275	That's news?
4521138	4521858	That is news.
4521878	4522739	That's smart.
4522759	4524080	That's great parenting.
4524120	4525820	That is wonderful parenting.
4525860	4526241	I love it.
4526781	4528482	And it's actually still on eBay right now.
4529642	4529923	Nice.
4531744	4532904	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
4532944	4533364	Who's this?
4534105	4534845	It's Legend of Zaku.
4535145	4535806	Hey, Zaku.
4535906	4536406	What's on your mind?
4537486	4539387	Nah, just nothing chilling.
4539547	4541929	You know, going through the gaming week as usual.
4542809	4544190	Alright, let me rephrase the question.
4544470	4546311	To what do we owe this telephone call tonight?
4547439	4558768	Um, I don't know, the usual arrow-smashing news, like, you know, how Supernova 2 is supposed to come out this month, and the fact that Betson is being dicks about holding EMUs back.
4560909	4567774	Hmm, um, yeah, I mean, I guess I've heard about Supernova 2, but, you know, I had a real... Zach, I want to share with you my revelation I had the other day.
4567954	4570216	Can I talk to you, you know, man-to-man a little bit?
4570656	4572217	Here's a revelation I had the other day, is that...
4573733	4577195	I was on Xbox Live and I was playing Portal, because I've been playing Portal a lot this week.
4577415	4586781	And you know my buddy Shane used to work at Konami, has had a big part in DDR, and he doesn't live here in California, he lives in Kansas, so we talk a lot over Xbox Live.
4587061	4589102	And I noticed that he was playing DDR Universe 2.
4589742	4594805	And he sent me a message on Xbox Live and he said, you know, Universe 2, blah, blah, blah, and he was telling me his thoughts on the game.
4594845	4598247	And I came to a realization, Zaku, and that realization was,
4598769	4599970	I'm kind of over DDR.
4600110	4600931	I really am.
4602372	4606095	There's not a lot that I care about that's going on in DDR anymore.
4606455	4609318	I'm not getting a boner over Supernova 2 like a lot of people are.
4609778	4614602	And it's sad to say, because obviously without DDR this show would not exist.
4614682	4616203	Without DDR I would not know Jamie.
4616263	4617544	Without DDR I would not know Loki.
4618025	4619246	Without DDR I would not know Puppy.
4620286	4623549	DDR has fucked up my life in so many good ways.
4624250	4624570	And bad.
4625086	4627347	I mean, because there was that house I lived in five years ago.
4627367	4628287	But that's a whole other story.
4628868	4630868	DDR has... Real World Rob Edition.
4631008	4631629	Oh, my God.
4631969	4632369	Oh, my God.
4632509	4633149	Oh, wow.
4633489	4634510	That's not so bad.
4634570	4635930	I mean, people grow out of it.
4636291	4639052	People stay on and live all of their lives.
4639192	4641513	Zaku, I didn't grow out of DDR.
4641933	4643494	You just don't care about it as much anymore.
4643514	4647295	DDR has refused to change over the past five years.
4647415	4648776	That's the problem I'm having with it.
4648836	4651757	It's the same fucking game I played five years ago, and I'm just kind of done with it.
4653123	4659108	Yeah, but I mean, I know people, most of the people that I know, they used to, you know, they're like some of the best in the city.
4659788	4660849	They don't play as much anymore.
4660889	4661930	They pretty much moved on.
4663334	4668897	I'm telling you, if Konami wants to bring me back, they just need to innovate the game.
4669117	4669877	It's possible.
4670198	4676441	They're trying to do it in little ways on the consoles, but they need to do it in a major way in the arcade and bring people back.
4676461	4680343	Yeah, in the arcade they tried EMUs, but there's other factors that are holding it back.
4680543	4685065	From what I hear, Betson is the reason why it's not happening in this country at all.
4685465	4687626	They don't believe that it's going to be successful.
4691530	4697096	But I know Konami does their, you know, tries their damn hardest and it's just other folks that are just being dicks about it.
4697236	4703583	And not, you know, they're just, they're just non-believers and, you know, it's like they don't really give a shit about it.
4705536	4707637	I wish I knew more about programming.
4707697	4713120	I would want to design my own music game that was dancing that's not a ripoff of DDR or in the groove or any of that stuff.
4713140	4715742	You know, I have a lot of ideas floating around my head for the past five years.
4715902	4716642	I just wish I could do it.
4716742	4716942	What?
4717162	4720144	Why don't they make a ParaPara game but without ParaPara music?
4720204	4724486	Because I remember when fucking Prestige used to fucking break out the Para shit.
4724647	4725707	That was kind of cool looking.
4726347	4730250	Granted, you know, people would make fun of it just like DDR, but it was a little different.
4730690	4730870	Hmm.
4732293	4737595	or they could just add a Ticket Redemption game to DDR and there you go.
4737615	4740276	Just throw it in a grave while you're at it.
4740356	4741977	Ever heard of that game Spider Stomp?
4742357	4744217	Spider Stomp?
4744257	4747339	Those red buttons on the floor and you get tickets out of them.
4747579	4753881	Doesn't that predate DDR a little bit more than it already is?
4754642	4756364	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4764346	4767429	Like, they have a DDR Supernova machine there, right?
4767489	4768910	And we were like, oh, Supernova.
4769210	4773474	But then I looked to my left, and I was like, oh my god, they have Jumpin' Jackpot!
4773554	4776656	And I ran over, and I played Jumpin' Jackpot!
4776696	4782341	Last time I played Supernova was yesterday, and then before that, it was like, you know, weeks.
4782922	4785043	I could go... Wait, let's let Jamie have her say it.
4785064	4785724	Jamie, Jamie.
4785744	4792510	We saw the DDR machine, and Dan and I were like, because my husband was here with us, we're like, hey, look, it's the new, um, uh...
4793485	4794005	Oh, shoot.
4794085	4794746	Airplane game.
4794986	4795266	Afterburner.
4795286	4795806	Afterburner.
4795926	4796267	Yeah.
4796907	4802590	And we spent most of the time either on the Afterburner or on that ride that William and I rode.
4804331	4804972	Not even that.
4805012	4807833	I mean, I'm also getting into other arcade games like Wangan.
4807873	4809714	I'm playing more Initial D now.
4809794	4814117	So, I mean, and I'm playing a lot more other Vermont games.
4814157	4818279	So, I mean, DDR is not really as much of an aspect in my life as it would be.
4818319	4821421	Sure, I mean, I try to go out to most of the tournaments.
4821957	4822878	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,
4845712	4846394	CustomSongs
4854258	4856698	for a better word just you know continue
4884566	4885447	Thank you for watching!
4916514	4917855	Oh god.
4917955	4920298	If that's adapting, then I want off the boat.
4920418	4924982	That's basically Konami's attempt of trying to suck money out of it dry.
4925343	4928126	And eventually, remember, it's kind of like oil.
4928386	4929507	It's not going to last forever.
4930188	4934953	So, I mean, he has to find an alternative means of just keeping the series alive.
4935868	4938410	by trying to please as many people as possible.
4938550	4947595	I've got to let you go, buddy, Zaku, but thank you for bringing up Bomani, as you usually do, and, you know, kind of allowing me to share my revelations with you.
4948396	4950497	I was going to bring up other things, but I had to get it out.
4950978	4951398	It's all right.
4951938	4952679	Next time, Zaku.
4953199	4953839	Talk to you next time.
4953859	4954140	All right.
4954800	4956841	We'll do one more call, if anything comes through.
4956861	4958582	877-GAME-OLR.
4958662	4961284	Yeah, that will play social commentary about oil, too.
4961544	4962565	No more stories, really?
4962985	4963686	Jamie, you have anything?
4963706	4964266	Today's a boring week.
4965133	4965573	This is boring.
4965614	4968095	Alright, well then one more call and we'll call it a show.
4968495	4974399	Have you seen, read the story that came up a couple days ago about that new PSP game called, I think it's Potsapon?
4974959	4979542	It's like another, it's like a music game where you have all these little armies of creatures.
4979562	4981103	Is that related to Panel de Pon?
4981163	4983024	Which is, um, no, okay.
4983044	4983845	It's a little bit different.
4983925	4988768	It looks like, I don't know, it's a little stretched, but it looks like LocoRoco, a little bit.
4989188	4989328	Hmm.
4990899	4995862	You know, I'm actually looking in chat, and caller, just hold on just a minute, we'll get to you in a second, because I picked up a call and I haven't acknowledged him yet.
4996262	5004226	But, um, let's see, I'm just looking at some interesting, because obviously a lot of our hardcore listeners have been listening to us since the days where we were like nothing but Bomani Talk.
5004586	5010229	GS191 says, the problem with DDR and arcades is basically that arcades are basically dead and nobody wants to do shit about it.
5010649	5015531	The problem with DDR console releases is that the music is way too mainstream and alienates the core audience.
5016312	5016452	Um...
5017299	5021820	and Jaded says, because the concept is overdone, but the music concept is great.
5023861	5026261	I kind of agree a little bit.
5026521	5039284	Although there is some type of allure to being able to play popular radio songs on there, I do think that DDR kind of opened my eyes, so to speak, to whole other genres of music that I didn't know existed before.
5039424	5039924	And who could forget
5042897	5048341	Aye, aye, aye, I'm your little butterfly Who could forget how catchy that freaking song was the first time they heard it?
5048401	5049322	Except for Loki.
5049482	5050323	You're just Mr. Negative.
5050643	5051704	Or Boom Boom Dollar.
5051904	5055006	Or, you know, just a variety of music that was in that game.
5055367	5062232	And that, I think, the Dance Maniacs series in general that kind of brought us a lot of music has been lost over the past few years, which is kind of sad.
5062252	5070198	Because after I started playing DDR for the first year or so, I actually started going out and looking up these artists and finding what other music they had.
5071038	5097656	and you know finding some good stuff that I still listen to but it's kind of a it just opens your eyes a little bit well the whole though going to the Dance Mania CDs all they are now is just more rehashes of the same yeah they're not exciting but then I look at Ultramix 2 and that opened my eyes to the whole synth pop and what you know indie a different drum label stuff and there's some awesome music on there and some of the bands that were in Ultramix 2 are like my favorite bands right now it's good stuff
5098271	5107637	Anyway, I just want to say real quick, Rob D in chat says, I disagree with that, I just think the DDR needs something new, releasing games with new songs just isn't going to cut it, and that's absolutely what I'm saying too.
5107938	5109098	That's absolutely what I'm saying.
5109399	5111420	Alright, anyway, let's, I'm sorry, I've made our caller wait.
5111780	5112401	Caller, are you still there?
5113121	5113401	Oh yeah.
5113581	5114382	Hi, who is this?
5115202	5115963	It's GS68.
5116203	5117364	Hi GS68, what's on your mind?
5117404	5117984	Sorry to make you wait.
5118264	5122147	Oh yeah, I've read about Super Smash Bros.
5122187	5124889	Brawl online, and it's looking good.
5126519	5130620	I'm sorry, you read it, you're cutting out a little bit, you read about it online and it is looking good or it isn't?
5131340	5131841	It isn't.
5132001	5134141	I just sent you a link to show you why.
5134781	5135842	Okay, let me look at this.
5136042	5138803	Why, and in your mind, why is this not looking good?
5138823	5139803	Is this about the friend codes?
5139823	5146785	Well, for example, if you get disconnected and the CPU takes over, like, no one will know that you disconnected, I mean...
5147796	5155163	They'll keep on thinking that it's the same person, which really bugs me because now I can't tell if someone quit and just played computer and stuff.
5155183	5155984	Yeah, but here's the thing, though.
5156004	5159647	I don't know if it's not really indicating that the person's disconnected or not.
5159667	5164832	It might say they've disconnected, but the player is being controlled by a computer now.
5165869	5167110	That is a very good point.
5167150	5179118	Yeah, I read about that earlier this week where basically just to recap for those who may not have heard, if you get disconnected or your Wii gets shut off or your power goes off or whatever in the middle of a match, you lose connection, the computer will automatically take control of your characters.
5179138	5180179	So you're not having to wait.
5180219	5181660	There's no buffer or anything like that.
5182000	5183161	It's just the computer takes over.
5183221	5193007	But I understand what GSTCA is saying is that if all the players disconnect and you're fighting the computer, how does online play differ from versus at all?
5194188	5194388	Exactly.
5195316	5201684	Exactly, and plus since no one knows that you disconnected, there's no shame in disconnecting anymore.
5203366	5210314	That is true, there should be a swift kick in the butt for when you disconnect, but hopefully... But it's going to reflect on their rankings, their stats.
5210715	5214840	Actually, no, you won't see their names or anything like...
5217794	5220015	I think that they're going to address this stuff.
5220055	5223757	I mean, what they've shown so far, they're just kind of going over features.
5223777	5227279	They haven't really delved into the details of what's going to be available on this.
5227420	5227840	I love it.
5227900	5230722	Jonathan F. says, send in Mr. Resetti if they disconnect.
5231502	5233403	Brilliant idea.
5233463	5234864	Mr. Resetti's in there, isn't he?
5235024	5235424	He is.
5236485	5237145	So, there you go.
5238006	5241348	But, you know, the Wii Online stuff in general just kind of sucks.
5241428	5244310	Like, it really needs an upgrade or a backbone or something.
5244690	5245170	I think Nintendo's
5248049	5248289	Go ahead.
5248509	5255012	I think Nintendo is trying to make it online accessible for everyone, but in doing so, they're oversimplifying online.
5255632	5258794	But let me tell you, okay, two stories for you.
5259174	5264357	A, I'm in Geometry Wars Galaxies, and Geometry Wars Galaxies has online leaderboards, which is kind of cool.
5265057	5267719	You register your name when you first go on, and you can go look at the leaderboards.
5267999	5268619	But here's the thing.
5268879	5270280	You can look at the leaderboards for...
5270920	5274143	The top 10 scores or where you are on the leaderboards.
5274523	5275043	And that's it.
5275184	5278266	And you're just looking at a big list of names that mean nothing to you.
5278646	5282189	Because you can't filter the list by the friends on your Wii.
5282609	5284691	You can't filter the list by anything but those things.
5284711	5285752	So it's kind of pointless.
5285812	5286652	It's kind of stupid.
5287413	5295139	I applaud Bizarre for trying to, you know, but I get the feeling they're just really restricted by Nintendo's lack of an online mainframe.
5295865	5300990	Well, that whole thing with the leaderboards is the same for Ghost Squad and the new Trauma Center as well.
5303312	5304693	Oh, well, yeah, I guess that's true.
5304753	5306775	I forgot Trauma Center has the leaderboards too.
5308697	5310919	At least I recognized a couple names on the leaderboards.
5311900	5312240	Did you?
5313361	5316364	Yeah, because they're from GameFAQs and I post on GameFAQs.
5317103	5319865	I feel sorry for you for posting on GameFAQs.
5345009	5348550	It's, you know, Nintendo's fault for having a weird online system.
5349231	5351432	So, anyhow.
5351712	5353332	Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?
5354133	5355013	Um, no.
5355553	5355793	All right.
5356073	5357854	Well, thank you very much for calling and listening to the show.
5357874	5358514	We appreciate it.
5358594	5359115	Have a good one.
5359955	5360495	You too.
5360795	5361135	Bye-bye.
5362476	5362716	All right.
5363294	5370059	Well, I guess that is going to be it for the calls tonight, and that's going to bring our show to a close as well, but thank you guys very much for tuning in and listening tonight.
5370499	5371900	Let's get to everybody's final thoughts.
5372120	5375443	Puppy, thank you for being here, and I hope you enjoyed the new studio.
5375523	5377664	It's much easier to breathe in here.
5378045	5378505	Yes, it is.
5378925	5383148	It's not nearly as uncomfortable as all cramming into an eight-foot space.
5383309	5383629	Exactly.
5383709	5384850	Any final thoughts, sir?
5387151	5391094	I am not looking forward to the next three months of class.
5391755	5392255	Sorry to hear it.
5392919	5395200	Loki, anyways, what's your final thought?
5395821	5397361	I'm buying computer parts.
5399482	5404204	My final thought is I want pie again.
5404745	5406746	I say that every week, but I really, really do want pie.
5406826	5409027	I have frozen pies in my freezer right now.
5409327	5410307	Well, did you bring one with you?
5410547	5411068	I did not.
5411268	5411708	Bastard.
5412428	5413529	I also have Smirnoffs, too.
5413729	5414609	DarkSakura.
5415370	5416270	Was that you?
5416290	5419452	We were playing rock band last night, and you're like, yeah, I've just been having two Smirnoffs.
5419492	5420052	This should be fun.
5420392	5421213	Yeah.
5421713	5422113	It was fun.
5422520	5423201	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5450413	5451133	I guess that's it.
5451213	5453214	We're going to call it a show.
5453414	5456455	Thank you guys so much for downloading us and supporting independent podcasting.
5456495	5457476	We couldn't do it without you guys.

5467940	5470661	Same bat time, same bat channel.
5473362	5474422	Do we know kind of anything?
5475003	5477204	Hopefully we're going to do a game next week or something.
