00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,040
Tonight, December 30th, 2007, on this special edition of Orange Lounge Radio, we take a

2
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:28,400
look back at the headlines and games of 2007 with our favorite people, all of our listeners.

3
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:35,320
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge

4
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,320
Radio.

5
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,880
I should say welcome back because we weren't here last week thanks to the holidays.

6
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:46,480
We are that video game program slash podcast slash live broadcast via Live 365 dedicated

7
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,240
to all things video games, video gaming, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle.

8
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,240
My name is Rob Roberts.

9
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:56,300
I'm here every week joined by my lovely co-host, the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers

10
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:57,300
is here.

11
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,300
Hi.

12
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,300
How are you?

13
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,840
I have a sinus infection.

14
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,640
Sorry to hear it.

15
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,120
You were sick quite a bit this year.

16
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,120
I'm sorry to hear.

17
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:08,160
I wasn't like sick, sick not like when I had the plague.

18
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,160
Right.

19
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,000
However, this is exactly how the plague started.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Oh no.

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,280
So, I hopped right on it and I have drugs that make me happy.

22
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,720
Well, I hope you feel better.

23
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,400
How was your week off?

24
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,400
Well, I did absolutely nothing.

25
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,400
That's good.

26
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,480
I sat on my ass and did absolutely nothing and it was beautiful.

27
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,000
Was Santa good to you?

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Santa was decent.

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,200
Santa brought me, actually Santa Dan gave me a game that I sort of blinked and went

30
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,120
WTF over, but I think I'm going to play it.

31
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,120
What's that?

32
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,120
You care to share?

33
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,120
That was, what's it?

34
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,120
Flash Focus.

35
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,120
The vision training game.

36
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,120
Yeah.

37
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,360
So, I'm going to play it because clearly I need my vision trained.

38
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,480
Well, I hope it works for you.

39
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:59,080
Then I started and we, I gave him, what did I give him?

40
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,720
I gave him Blade Runner.

41
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,720
Cool.

42
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:05,080
And I bought him Ratatouille on Blu-ray.

43
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:08,720
For use on the Playstation 3 because that's your Blu-ray player too, right?

44
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,720
Very cool.

45
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,720
It's pretty.

46
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,720
Alright.

47
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,720
Pretty.

48
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,720
Well, we'll hear more about your game in a week in just a minute.

49
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,720
That's not a game.

50
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,360
Well, I know, but we'll get the other games as well, right?

51
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,320
Well, I got to introduce, he's sitting there waiting for me to say the one and only

52
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,760
tech master, Loki.

53
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,840
I'm not really waiting for you, but it's fine.

54
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,280
How are you doing tonight, Loki?

55
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,280
I'm doing fine.

56
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,280
Alright.

57
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,280
Good to hear.

58
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,280
And how was your Christmas?

59
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,280
Was Santa good to you?

60
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,280
I was good to me.

61
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,280
Were you?

62
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,280
Yeah.

63
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,280
Because I built a new computer.

64
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,760
Oftentimes we buy ourselves the best gifts, right?

65
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,760
Exactly.

66
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:43,360
Because I buy everything for myself, I don't normally get anything from everyone else because

67
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:49,960
they figure I've already bought it, which is usually the case, but I don't know.

68
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,960
Alright.

69
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:54,120
Well, tonight is going to be a little bit different because we're going to be doing

70
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,760
the year in review.

71
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,480
We're just kind of having a very informal, kind of a slow show tonight.

72
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,280
I got to say, I noticed that our chat room is not quite as hopping as it usually is over

73
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,700
at chat.orangelandrater.com, which has me a little worried because tonight's show is

74
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:11,400
supposed to be all about the listeners interacting with us and everything, but I do see, obviously

75
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,360
there are some people there chatting it up.

76
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:20,780
Tiger Claw wants to know, he's in chat, chat.orangelandrater.com, wants to know if Loki has heard that Black

77
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,500
Wolf bought the Eye of Judgment.

78
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,500
Good for him.

79
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:29,240
That's one more towards one million, which will never, ever, ever happen, ever.

80
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:37,160
And I remember, just to reiterate from two weeks ago, it has to sell a million some day.

81
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,160
Some day.

82
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:42,080
So yes, the bet was actually extended from six months to one million copies ever, and

83
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,440
then Loki will don the tingle suit and set fire to an Eye of Judgment.

84
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,440
Whenever that happens.

85
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:51,120
Which apparently he knows about because he actually mentioned on the show something about

86
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,080
Loki being one step closer to wearing the tingle suit.

87
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,920
So that kind of takes the fun out of it, but whatever, maybe he's waiting to YouTube it.

88
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,920
I don't know.

89
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,560
So I think Bobby's doing his own year-end show tonight.

90
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,560
It's probably still going.

91
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,820
That's probably where some of our listeners are, who knows?

92
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:08,460
But meanwhile, we actually are going to continue on doing the things we usually do.

93
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:14,680
We weren't here last week because of the holidays, so Merry Christmas, Kwanzaa, Hanukkah, Solstice,

94
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,640
Ramadan, whatever the hell it is you celebrate.

95
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,640
I hope it was good.

96
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,640
Or nothing at all, if you're atheist, right?

97
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,640
I hope it was good.

98
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,640
Whatever you did.

99
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,640
Ramadan is not until later in the year.

100
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,360
Oh, what am I mixing it up with?

101
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,360
Oh well.

102
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,360
Who knows?

103
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,360
Who cares?

104
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,360
Somebody cares.

105
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,360
Festivus.

106
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,360
Maybe it's Festivus.

107
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,360
Because they're so similar.

108
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,080
I'm just trying to be PC and not leave anybody out.

109
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,080
So there you have it.

110
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,200
Whatever it is you celebrate, I hope it was good.

111
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,480
Let's talk about our gaming weeks, because we do talk about that, or I guess I should

112
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,040
say, our gaming two weeks.

113
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,280
Dark Soccer, how was your gaming two weeks?

114
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,880
I got Orange Box, so I played some Portal.

115
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:53,520
I decided that I really like Half-Life 2, Episode 2, which Dan beat last night.

116
00:04:53,520 --> 00:05:01,600
I played a lot of Pinball, and I played a lot of Ragnarok, run any server now, run the

117
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:07,060
Essence RO server, and they're better, and they don't go down randomly without putting

118
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:09,640
up a freaking announcement, why?

119
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,440
So I was going to say, so you've switched servers now.

120
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:21,160
I've jumped the ship, but not a shark, because I'm awesome.

121
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:28,800
And I've been trying to get back into playing some Final Fantasy VI, which I have on my

122
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,800
DS.

123
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,800
Very cool.

124
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,160
But I've really just been doing more Portal.

125
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,440
I can't play very much of it because I get sick, and, and, and, and, and Dan got me

126
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:44,520
a rock band, I said I was going to get it, and I did.

127
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,520
Very cool.

128
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:50,200
And our guitar broke the first day, so we've been using the Guitar Hero guitars, because

129
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,200
we have two.

130
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,200
Gotcha.

131
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,120
Well, we actually have a whole bunch of them, because Dan's friend Will, his stuff lives

132
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:00,760
at our house sometimes, and Dan got my Iron Lung just for me, and I can't say that I like

133
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,760
it.

134
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,080
I need to buy that.

135
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,120
And I wasn't in the same room listening to it, but it sounded like a cover.

136
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,360
Oh, it's not the original?

137
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:13,320
But the music is all dead on, just some, some of the covers just are like, no.

138
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:18,320
Well, maybe they didn't want to get sued like the Guitar Heroes 80s people did.

139
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,000
And I sang, I sang Creep, and I sang it the right way.

140
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Did you?

141
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
The right way.

142
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,760
So you got the whole bundle then, you didn't just get the game itself, you got the mic

143
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,760
and the drums and everything.

144
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,760
We got everything.

145
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,760
That's nice.

146
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,760
We have, we have it all.

147
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,840
So when are we going to rock out?

148
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,080
You, me, and Loki have to make a band.

149
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,080
When are we going to rock out?

150
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:36,080
We're having it at, at our party tomorrow night.

151
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,080
Oh.

152
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,160
We have conflicting parties going on, sadly.

153
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,720
Every year, and I invite you every year.

154
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,800
Ironically enough, we're also probably going to be playing rock band.

155
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,560
Ironically enough, I believe Matt is bringing rock band to, uh, to cost us a rob.

156
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,560
I need a case for rock band.

157
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,520
Seriously, that box is just too big to carry around lugging that thing.

158
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,280
You need to get one of those nifty little cases.

159
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,640
Well, you know, I'll get around to it eventually.

160
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,600
Alright, well, Dark Soccer, you gotta come over at some point once all the party madness

161
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,160
is done and we'll rock out to some Radiohead.

162
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,800
Well, hey, I'm off work at least the next day.

163
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,360
I have to go to work tomorrow, which is both craptacular and full of sucktitude.

164
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,200
Sorry to hear it.

165
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,480
Uh, Dark Knight in Chat says, I would love to hear Jamie singing.

166
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,020
Any possibilities of YouTubes in the future?

167
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,020
Not on YouTube.

168
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,020
Not on YouTube?

169
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:25,480
If my, if my throat doesn't kill me and I'm drunk enough, maybe.

170
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,480
Alright.

171
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:31,680
Well, the whole, the whole problem is that every year I get a sinus infection without

172
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,680
fail.

173
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,680
This we all know.

174
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,760
But I always am sick on New Year's Eve.

175
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:42,200
I'm telling you, man, we need to get that video from Eddie that has fucking Iron Man

176
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,200
singing sabotage.

177
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,840
A rice princess doing sabotage.

178
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,020
Way better than me doing even Timmy.

179
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,020
It's hilarious.

180
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:55,480
Well, at any rate, I, I always get very, very drunk while I'm very, very sick, which is

181
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,980
pretty stupid.

182
00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:01,280
And then they make me sing Karaoke Revolution and last year I tried to sing Snake Eater

183
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,880
and I had no voice.

184
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:11,400
I had no voice, so I was like, that's what it sounded like.

185
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:17,120
Um, actdeft is in chat and actdeft is, uh, um, saying that we should go out on tour.

186
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:22,300
He says the OLR world tour, the sensible world of podcasting tour, AKA the fag, your anger

187
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:25,860
tour, which is a inside joke from 2007 of course.

188
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:26,860
I like that.

189
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:28,260
The sensible world of podcasting tour.

190
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,260
That's a good name.

191
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,260
That's very cool.

192
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,260
Very good.

193
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,840
So, Logie, how was your gimme weed, Logie?

194
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:37,640
Um, well this week, or actually last week and the week before last, uh, I took some

195
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:43,440
time off to play games and let's see, I didn't play as much as I thought I would because

196
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:49,040
I ended up playing mostly Saints Bro because I'm trying to finish it, you know, months

197
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,760
after it's come out, but you know, trying to finish it.

198
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:57,260
I'm actually, according to the game, halfway through it, but I'm done with two of the storylines,

199
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:58,640
some on the last one.

200
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:06,240
And then, um, I played a little bit more Earth Defense Force 2017, and um, just now I have

201
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:14,120
to grind to get, you know, more HP I guess, because I get raped by all the ants and ships

202
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:18,320
and stuff on the last levels on Inferno, so the only way I can do that now is just to

203
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:23,480
get, you know, tons and tons and tons and tons of health, which is gonna be incredibly

204
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:27,880
boring to do, and um, so that'll be fun.

205
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:37,160
And then, let's see, I bought a new 360, so I was, you know, playing stuff on that, um,

206
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:42,380
I have my old 360 which I'm actually gonna fix, which is weird, um, because I think if

207
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:47,120
I replace the, um, they have the X-clamp on there that you can replace, the heatsink,

208
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,120
um, it should fix it because that, I hear something underneath the board that sounds

209
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,320
like, I don't know, like a ball bearing rolling around, and I think that's actually some of

210
00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:00,200
the solder stripped off the board and actually kind of clumped up into a little ball, so

211
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:06,280
I'm guessing that some of the solder's probably, um, I don't know, shorting out the board somewhere,

212
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:10,960
so once I pull it all off we'll be able to see what's wrong, but apparently the X-clamp

213
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:16,920
fix or whatever is fixed about 90% of the, you know, three ring boards, so, we'll see,

214
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:21,180
I'll give it a shot, because hell, what can I do, break it more?

215
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:28,040
It's already broken, so, who cares, um, and then, I played a little bit of Final Fantasy

216
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:33,700
12 Revenant Wings, it's okay, I don't know, it's a little different, I guess it's the

217
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:40,920
combat system's kind of similar to Final Fantasy 12 a little bit, but, I guess because I didn't

218
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:46,320
play 12, the impact of these characters and when they're like, you know, oh, this person

219
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:52,480
came, it's like, okay, who are you, I don't know who you are, um, so it's okay for me,

220
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,760
but probably I should have played 12 before I played the DS game, but hey, that's their

221
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:02,280
damn fault for releasing one game on the DS and one on the PS2, um, let's see, what else

222
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:08,200
did I play, um, I actually played quite a bit of, um, No More Heroes, that game is fucking

223
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:13,840
awesome, it seriously is awesome, after reading a fact on Game Facts that was actually in

224
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:18,760
English, I kind of figured out how to actually play the game, pretty cool, I've finished

225
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:22,320
the first boss and you kind of have to run around and do different errands and stuff,

226
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:27,000
but um, pretty sweet game, definitely worth picking up when it comes out, and I think

227
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:33,160
it's only a few more weeks before it comes out, so, that'd be a cool one, um, and then,

228
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:36,880
other than that, just been playing around with my new PC, trying to get, well, Crysis

229
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:41,960
runs on it, I've just been trying to overclock it now, so, um, right now I've run into the

230
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:46,300
problem where I need a good program to read temperatures because every single program

231
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:50,200
they have reads it differently and I want to know which one's correct, so, you know,

232
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:57,720
I don't fry something, but, uh, my chips overclocked from 2.6 GHz to 3.3 right now, and then, um,

233
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:05,760
Crysis runs about 35, 40 frames per second, but I want it to run faster, and I'm also

234
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:13,520
getting another graphics card, because I replaced my old GTS, uh, or my 8800 GTS with the new

235
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:22,240
one that's, um, faster, the GTS 512, and then, um, getting a second one to SLI him, so, uh,

236
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:27,520
hopefully Crysis will run, um, shooting for 50 frames per second or 60, you know, I doubt

237
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,920
that's going to happen, but, smoother the better.

238
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:35,760
Alright, well, quite a lengthy gaming week, Loki, geez, I'm busy, uh, mine kind of pales

239
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:40,520
by comparison, you know, um, since the family of mine doesn't do a whole lot for the holidays,

240
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:45,560
uh, William and I decided to take a last minute getaway to Reno, and so, you know, Reno, not

241
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:49,160
to offend any of our listeners who might live in Reno, but it's kind of a poor man's Vegas,

242
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:54,360
you know, there's not a whole lot to do in Reno, except, you know, go to the big three

243
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:58,840
casinos, but we did go to one of the casinos there, uh, Harrah's, and just randomly we

244
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:02,360
found ourselves in the arcade, and I'll tell you what, the Harrah's arcade is actually

245
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,960
kind of cool, because there was a lot of classic shit in there that we got to kind of take

246
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:11,280
up, take some time to look at, including, um, uh, Mortal Kombat 4, they actually had

247
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,800
a Mortal Kombat 4 machine, which I haven't seen in a long time, and the Simpsons arcade

248
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,280
game, and William and I only played, like, one token on the Simpsons arcade game, but

249
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:21,000
it must have been set to easy or something, because we got quite a ways through the game,

250
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,880
uh, just on one token, which is pretty amazing, and here's the other cool thing they have

251
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:31,920
there, they have a DDR fourth mix solo machine, and I haven't seen one of those in years,

252
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,480
and of course, William's like, you gotta get up and dance, you gotta dance, like, I haven't

253
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:40,280
played DDR forever, Harrah's Tahoe, you said? No, that's Harrah's, uh, Reno, not Tahoe,

254
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:45,960
yeah. I played on that DDR fourth plus machine, yes, the solo one, I do remember that now,

255
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:50,680
but, um, yeah, that's funny. You know what's weird is that the casino's very odd, because

256
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:55,120
the arcade is, like, way back there, like, it's not like Circus Circus, which has all

257
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,880
those, which has, like, a new Pump It Up machine right in the middle of everything, but, like,

258
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,640
you know, at, um, Harrah's, you have to kind of go all the way back, and it's, like, back

259
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,600
in a dark corner, it's kind of sad. I'm guessing the Pump It Up machine's probably right in

260
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,520
the front of their arcade, where the third crane machine used to be for a while. And

261
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:15,200
now GS68 is telling me that at the El Dorado, they have the fourth plus solo machine, which

262
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,720
I completely miss somehow, but that's alright, you know what I was doing? I was gambling

263
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:24,880
and losing a lot of money. I won little jack, I won jackpots, I won a silver jackpot, except

264
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:32,520
it was on a penny machine, so I only won 35 bucks. That's cool. Solo sucks anyways. That's

265
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:38,640
a dated joke, wow. Oh my god, a DDR USA mix machine, yes. Oh, rad. That takes me back.

266
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:43,520
Oh, yeah, that takes me back. Good times. I love DDR USA. So, yeah, but here's the sad

267
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:47,320
thing, I had to play on trick. Like, remember when I used to be really good at DDR, and

268
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:52,880
you were good at DDR, and you were good at DDR? You used to play doubles, Jamie. I used

269
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:59,000
to play doubles on, like, five feet. I still play doubles, and hope that death comes to

270
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:05,400
me, but... Those were the days. And then, actually, it's funny, because some of my,

271
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:09,960
actually, those of you guys that know Xtopher, Xtopher's sister got married over the weekend,

272
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:16,040
and she married somebody who used to work at Konami's QA department with Shane, so I

273
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:20,600
saw a lot of people from my DDR days, because he obviously invited all his old co-workers.

274
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,160
I saw some people from the old DDR days, I hadn't seen him forever, so it was really

275
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:30,280
cool. Kind of a little bit of reunion. So it was nice. Anyhow, moving on, that has nothing

276
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:33,440
to do with Game of the Week, that's just tremendously. As far as other games, I played some World

277
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:42,400
of Warcraft, of course. I now have, like, I think three PVP purples, and some crafted

278
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:47,480
rare epic stuff, so I'm definitely starting to exhaust everything there is to do at level

279
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:52,000
70, but I still have lots of instances to run, and alts to level. And also, I'll tell

280
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,600
you what I've been playing. Santa brought me a copy of Super Mario Galaxy on the Wii,

281
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,840
which I'd played before on our preview show, but it was nice to have some more time to

282
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:04,980
play it without kind of that pressure of, you know, everything we're doing is being

283
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:07,960
broadcast on the internet, right? So I just kind of had time to take it slow, take it

284
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:13,920
easy. I fucking love it. You know what? And you know, I've said this on the show before,

285
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:18,600
folks have been listening for a while, I thought Mario 64 was a little bit overrated. I did

286
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:23,880
not think Mario 64 was the best Mario game of all time or any of that stuff. I just didn't

287
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:27,720
see it. I mean, it's a good game, yes. In fact, it's a great game, but it wasn't, like,

288
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:32,400
there was something about it I didn't quite like as much. But Mario Galaxy, it really

289
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:37,040
is all that. I mean, I love some of the puzzles in it, like that gravity puzzle where you're

290
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:42,200
inside the tube and the gravities change in a different way. I just, it's cool. I love

291
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:47,480
it. So I definitely recommend, if you're a Wii owner, you have to get Galaxy, because

292
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:51,600
this is the type of game that the Wii was really made for. So I've definitely been spending

293
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,640
a lot of time on that. And thank you, Santa, for bringing me that. So that's pretty much

294
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:59,800
going to do it for my gaming week. How about you guys on the chat room, how was your guys'

295
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:07,880
gaming week? I see a lot of people were naming BeatMania 2DX distorted, Rockband was played

296
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:16,040
by Color of Sakura, Legend of Zelda Phantom Hourglass, Xenae or Xene, X-E-N-E, was playing

297
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:19,240
Persona 3. That's one of those games that came out this year that I totally missed.

298
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:23,320
I finished the Phantom Hourglass finally. Oh, what'd you think? The ending. It's easy.

299
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:30,440
It's a fucking easy game. I mean, that was it. The last boss is kind of, I guess, a little

300
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:35,880
bit more difficult than the rest of them, but it was really easy. It's just, I'm not

301
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:41,000
that great at games, but come on. I mean, seriously, it wasn't a challenge at all.

302
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,920
Alright. Anyhow, let's get into some housekeeping, then we'll get into some of tonight's news

303
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,880
and I'll tell you how the rest of the show's going to work, too. Our show's going to be

304
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:51,760
a little bit different tonight, and we're going to actually open up the Skype line a

305
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,920
little early tonight. Of course, now that I'm noticing that a lot of our regulars aren't

306
00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:00,440
here and, you know, I'm hoping that we're going to get some calls on Skype line because

307
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:03,600
we really want you guys to participate, but if you guys don't call, we'll figure something

308
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:08,200
else out. But basically what we're going to do, before tonight's show, we went through

309
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:12,280
every single show role that we've done in 2007 because we write down all the stories

310
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:15,880
we want to cover in tonight's show. And so we basically went to every single show role

311
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:21,120
in 2007 and picked one story that really stuck out from each show that we did in 2007. So

312
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,560
we're going to kind of go back and revisit some of the headlines from our various shows

313
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:28,840
in 2007 and then talk about, with you guys on the phone, kind of what really stuck out

314
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:33,000
in your mind from the various months and what do you think really impacted the gaming scene

315
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,720
and the gaming industry as a whole in 2007. And then, of course, we want to get your picks

316
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:41,840
for the best game of 2007 and the worst game of 2007. We're going to tally it up and get

317
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:46,120
the definitive Orange Lounge radio choices. And at the very end of the show, Dark Soccer,

318
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:51,960
Alokia, myself, we will be letting you know our worst games of the year and our top five

319
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:56,680
favorite games of the year, each of us. And it's always very interesting because usually

320
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:01,680
we don't agree with critics because they are our personal top five favorites of the year.

321
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:06,240
It doesn't necessarily mean the games we think that, you know, should be critically lauded

322
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,400
as the five best. No, they're the five games we enjoy the most and we think were the best

323
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,200
that we spent our money on. So we'll be talking about that towards the end of tonight's show.

324
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,880
But for now, we're going to do a quick news rundown because we weren't here last week

325
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,600
and, of course, there still is news going on in the gaming world, even this week. So

326
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:24,240
before we get into the year-end review, let's talk about this week. And Loki is going to

327
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,760
do the honors tonight of just running down the week's news. And I think actually Jamie

328
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,560
has one or two stories. We'll get to that at the end.

329
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:34,840
Yeah. Okay. Anyways, this week, some, you know, stuff that's probably like not a big

330
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:40,880
surprise happened, including Sony of America Trademark Resistance 2. Oh my God, really?

331
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:45,320
They're going to make a sequel to a game that sold a lot for them. Oh my God, that is such

332
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,320
a shocker.

333
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,400
I'm so surprised.

334
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:58,120
So surprised. Anyways, Kiriyamaoka, one of our favorite music producers and also creator

335
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,800
of some recent Sun Hill games.

336
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,680
Gaming stud in general, wouldn't you agree, DarkSakura?

337
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,680
He's cute.

338
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:08,400
Gaming, he is pretty cute. We met him in person at E3 a few years ago. Gaming stud in general,

339
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:13,080
Kiriyamaoka. I don't just mean in the physical sense. I mean, he's just, he makes Silent

340
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:16,000
Hill for God's sake. He's amazing.

341
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,640
So we listen to what this man has to say.

342
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:26,480
Anyways, he was quoted actually saying that the U.S. team's graphical and technical ability

343
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:33,320
is amazing. There's a huge gap, actually, and he's talking about between the U.S. teams

344
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:39,760
and Japanese development houses with the way games are going right now. I don't know. I

345
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:46,040
guess that makes kind of sense, especially with a lot of the companies being in the U.S.,

346
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:50,040
Nintendo, I mean, they're both in Japan, the U.S. and stuff, but I don't know. A lot of

347
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:53,880
the third party companies are in the U.S., so I guess that makes sense. Not to say the

348
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,920
Japanese can't program good games.

349
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:59,720
I want to go off on a tangent real fast, because this discussion was actually, I was talking

350
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:02,720
to one of my friends in the car. We were up very late last night because we drove to Rocky

351
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:07,280
Horror in San Francisco, and it was William, myself, and our mutual friend, Jake, and Jake's

352
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:11,280
a big gaming nerd like us, and we were talking about kind of Japanese versus America, and

353
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,360
I think actually I was talking about this very thing right here, because somehow we

354
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,760
were talking about Silent Hill.

355
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:20,640
It kind of occurred to me, Nintendo's a very Japanese company, whereas Microsoft's a very

356
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:26,640
American company, and Microsoft seems to be kind of winning this. Well, I mean, I guess

357
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,360
I shouldn't say that, because the Wii is obviously dominating, but the Xbox is kind of dominating

358
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:34,440
in their own way, and it's kind of like, you know, the Xbox kind of caters to what's really

359
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:38,600
big in the American market right now, and that's internet gaming, and that's something

360
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:42,960
that, for whatever reason, Nintendo has never seen to capture.

361
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,300
Like, you know, Nintendo is not getting on board with internet gaming. They did one game

362
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:50,360
on the GameCube that was a third party game to begin with, right, and they really haven't

363
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:53,920
done much on the Wii yet. I mean, granted, we have Mario Kart, but we've all seen the

364
00:21:53,920 --> 00:22:00,440
friend codes thing sucks and all that, and we were kind of wondering, like, why is it

365
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:04,360
that Nintendo does not get online gaming? And it kind of struck me, it's probably a

366
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:10,360
cultural difference, and what it probably is, is that arcades are dead here in America,

367
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:14,800
and that's why we're so big on internet gaming, whereas in Japan, it seems like arcades are

368
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:19,320
still, I mean, maybe not what they once were, but they're still very prevalent, and people

369
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,020
still meet up to do the gaming.

370
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:24,960
So what? I don't understand, though, because they recognize, though, that the US and, like,

371
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:31,080
Europe and stuff are big gaming markets and maybe even bigger than Japan, and, you know,

372
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:34,720
they recognize it. That's why we're getting so many Wiis here in the US. So it's not like

373
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,480
they don't understand that. It's just, they're just not doing it.

374
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:41,920
But, kind of like why I'm relating it to this story is that, you know, when that's their

375
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:46,320
culture, that's their perspective on things, and so maybe, I think, part of the reason

376
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:50,720
why, like, Akira Yomoka might be kind of, you know, really liking what the Americans

377
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:55,240
are doing now is that because it's a different approach based on the way things work here.

378
00:22:55,240 --> 00:23:01,060
I'll tell you what it is, and this is pretty much, I mean, when they were planning out

379
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:07,200
these consoles, when the 360, PlayStation 3, and the, you know, we were all in development

380
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,320
and stuff, and they figured out what they wanted to do, Microsoft already had some success

381
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:16,080
with the Xbox Live service, so of course they wanted to bring that over, and they had done

382
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:23,080
a little bit with the Xbox Live Arcade service on the Xbox, very little, and then, you know,

383
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:28,900
of course it took off here. Problem is, though, Nintendo didn't plan for any sort of online

384
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:32,680
infrastructure. They didn't think it was a big deal. They said, oh, whatever, you know,

385
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:36,160
our systems sell very well by themselves. We have the portable systems, you know, maybe

386
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:39,600
we'll link it up with the DS and that kind of stuff, and they didn't really do anything

387
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:44,760
with it. Well, you know, come to find out, guess what? Online gaming is really popular,

388
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:48,680
and now they're like, crap, what do we do now? We don't have any sort of infrastructure

389
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:53,080
built for this stuff, and so now they're way behind with all that. Same with the PlayStation

390
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:56,200
Network, I mean, they didn't really have a unified online service or anything like that.

391
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:01,160
I think Sony's issue is that they are stretching themselves thin, because you notice when games

392
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:05,480
keep getting delayed, like, you know, LittleBigPlanet Home keeps getting delayed, I think that to

393
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:09,840
me says that Sony, their thing is that they've been trying to do both. They've been trying

394
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:14,520
to, to Sony's credit, I think everything they've been doing, they've been trying to

395
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:17,780
appeal, they are the ones that have truly been trying to appeal to a worldwide audience

396
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:21,320
the whole time, but they're stretching themselves too thin, they can't do it, they don't have

397
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:26,880
the resources to do it. Whereas Nintendo has focused their efforts on this, and Xbox for

398
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,080
the most part has focused their efforts on this, and both have excelled very well, while

399
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,600
Sony has spread themselves too thin. Well, and the other thing too, Microsoft now is

400
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,240
starting to figure out, hey, guess what, we've got to, you know, think about our Japanese

401
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:41,040
market as well, and that's why they're publishing games, you know, like, Lost Odyssey, Blue

402
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:47,920
Dragon, you know, stuff like that, to appeal to a more variety of, you know, consumer.

403
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:51,080
Because, you know, not everyone's going to love Halo, or love that kind of stuff, and

404
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:56,040
they're trying to also do, like, some of the kids' games and stuff, you know, Pinata, kind

405
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,920
of sucked, but, you know what, they don't have to really worry about that.

406
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,000
It was a good attempt.

407
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,280
It was an okay attempt, but they're, you know, third party, you know, publishers will take

408
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:08,920
care of that stuff, they don't have to really worry about it. Whereas Nintendo, they're

409
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:13,720
doing a lot of stuff that caters kind of towards the family, you know, the younger kids, you

410
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:17,280
know, even though they're trying to break out of that mold and stuff, unfortunately

411
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:21,920
a lot of the games that they're still releasing, even look at first party stuff, I mean, what,

412
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:26,320
you've got Metroid Prime 3, I guess that would be the only game, and maybe Excite Truck,

413
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:30,520
that's, you know, first party that would kind of appeal to, you know, more than just kids.

414
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:35,360
You know, some of these games like Disaster Day of Crisis, and, you know, Project Hammer,

415
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:41,060
which is cancelled, I mean, those games could have appealed to some older, you know, consumers,

416
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:45,400
but they didn't do it, so they kind of have to rely on third party companies to do that,

417
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:49,040
but unfortunately because there's not a lot of, you know, hey, look at this, you know,

418
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:53,160
it's a first party game, it was more of a mature title, it did really well, then a lot

419
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:57,480
of other companies will try to emulate that, but since no one's doing that, you know, look

420
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:02,880
at Manhunt 2, they attempted to be mature, and that kind of backfired on them, not because,

421
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,920
you know, it was mature, it was because it was a crappy game, but, you know, I think

422
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:11,340
like with games like No More Heroes coming out, I think that will do very well, I hope

423
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:15,280
it does very well, and because of that, a lot of people will say, hey, mature games

424
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:18,840
can be on this console, and so we'll put out more mature games.

425
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:24,000
Alright, well, I was going to turn to the chat room for some comments on this, some

426
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,840
polarizing statements made by us on Viva Pinata, Flaming Bozo says, Viva did not suck, and

427
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,720
Pooeater says, Viva did suck, so some polarizing opinions there.

428
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,920
Alright, what did they try to do with Viva Pinata?

429
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:36,920
I went from suck to blow.

430
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:41,120
Let me put it this way, what they, their expectations of Viva Pinata versus what actually happened

431
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,360
were a little different, they thought it was going to be the next Pokemon.

432
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:48,080
Yeah, I agree, they set their bar way too high on Viva Pinata, and I would not, I certainly

433
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:52,760
would never put Viva Pinata on a bad games of the year list, it just wasn't, it's not,

434
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:53,880
it wasn't Pokemon.

435
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:57,880
It's not a bad game, it's just a game I'm not going to play, I mean, there are kids,

436
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:01,760
I'm sure, that love the game, there are probably adults that love the game, it's just not for

437
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,760
me.

438
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,840
Viva Pinata Party Animals, that's crap.

439
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:11,560
I think even like, Major Nelson has said Viva Pinata Party Animals sucks, and that's pretty

440
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:17,360
bad when the people inside Microsoft don't like the game, I don't know that to be sure,

441
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,360
don't quote me on that.

442
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:21,640
They tried to look at what Pokemon has, and kind of emulate that, so they're like, okay,

443
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:25,760
it has a cartoon series, great, let's do a cartoon series, and it had a game, okay, let's

444
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,760
do this.

445
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,960
They put this out here, exactly like Pokemon, it's going to have the appeal of Pokemon.

446
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:34,480
No, it did not, in fact, I thought that adding the cartoon as well is kind of just shoving

447
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,360
it down our throats even more.

448
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:40,520
Just leave it as a game, if the game was popular enough to warrant a cartoon, great, do that.

449
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:45,900
I like Pooh Eater's idea, Viva Manhunt Pinata, there you go, I'm sorry, I did not mean to

450
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:52,360
derail the show with that little tangent, but when hasn't that happened before, sorry.

451
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:57,600
Next week, SNK will be producing yet another new game, oh wait, no, I'm sorry, they're

452
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:03,160
not, they're going to be putting out Metal Slug 3 on Xbox Live Arcade.

453
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:07,160
And the sound of Jamie cheering, by the way, is the only person you'll hear cheering about,

454
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,160
no, I'm just kidding.

455
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,160
You know what, it looks cool.

456
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,160
Metal Slug has a cult fanbase.

457
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,920
It's supposed to have updated HD visuals.

458
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,920
That's cool.

459
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,400
Whatever that's supposed to mean, because all the screenshots don't look updated to

460
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:19,000
me, but okay, I'll take the word for it.

461
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,600
Does HD visuals mean that they've added bars on the side that are prez?

462
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:28,760
They're going to do like they did with Double Dragon, not Double Dragon, yeah, Double Dragon.

463
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,760
That's okay, I guess.

464
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:33,240
It looks okay, I think, hey, you know what, if SNK's listening, if you want to remake

465
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:38,480
the game, great, or like reissue it, but like, redo all the visuals kind of like, I don't

466
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:44,760
know, Super Street Fighter 2, HD, whatever, you know, that's going to be coming out, redo

467
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,320
all the graphics, that'd be awesome.

468
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,440
Metal Slug might actually be a really fun live game.

469
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,440
It is.

470
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,440
Like, to play with people on live.

471
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:56,960
And it is going to have co-op over live, so that's kind of cool, and so yeah, it's 800

472
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,320
Microsoft points, should be out Wednesday, no word on if there's going to be another

473
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,520
game coming out as well, because it's only one game announced so far.

474
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,760
You know, and to Metal Slug's credit, although Loki and I give it a hard time on this show

475
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:10,840
for kind of being the same thing over and over, it really is a lot of fun, I think this

476
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:11,840
will be a good title.

477
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:19,800
I'd like to, you know, make fun of SNK because, you know, they're still making 16-bit games

478
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,800
all these years later.

479
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:25,040
The last four games that have come out from them have been, like, anthologies, okay, so,

480
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:28,860
no offense, I mean, hey, you know what, you're not the only company that does that, Capcom

481
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:31,840
and Activision, or Midway, I mean, everybody's...

482
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:36,680
But some of the anthologies, like the Mega Man anthology kicks ass, like, I don't know.

483
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,680
I don't know.

484
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:43,560
I just, you know, seriously, Metal Slug 3, Metal Slug 1, they've been re-released so

485
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:48,520
many times, it's like, okay, great, we love these games, but let's make something new,

486
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,520
okay?

487
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:55,560
Anyways, so, there's of course a new Street Fighter movie coming out, and not sure whether

488
00:29:55,560 --> 00:30:00,520
you're going to be happy about that or not, but apparently one of the stars that they

489
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:08,480
have casted so far is in the role of Chun-Li, and it's Smallville's Kristin Kriek, and,

490
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,760
I don't know, she doesn't look Asian to me, but hey, she looks hot, so that's...

491
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,080
Is that the one that plays Lana?

492
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,080
I believe so.

493
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,080
Yeah, I believe so.

494
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,080
She's Asian.

495
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:21,240
She doesn't look Asian.

496
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:27,560
I'm sorry, that's not, I don't know, whatever, it'll work, I think, but hey.

497
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,560
Is she hot?

498
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:31,680
I mean, that's what most of the boys want to know, is she hot?

499
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,680
And some of the girls.

500
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:36,160
You know, that's the most important thing, isn't it?

501
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,600
I mean, ethnicity be damned.

502
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:43,480
Anyways, so, I don't know if you, really to be honest, the last Street Fighter movie didn't

503
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:47,680
set the bar too high, so, I mean, you don't have to try that hard to make a good movie

504
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,680
here.

505
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,680
But it had Kylie.

506
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:53,240
Yes, Kylie Minogue was awesome as Kami.

507
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,240
And who was Chun-Li?

508
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,320
Ming-Na was Chun-Li.

509
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,320
She's on ER now.

510
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,320
She wasn't bad.

511
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,320
She wasn't bad.

512
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:04,320
Apparently, anyways, I've actually watched this little video here.

513
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:10,000
There is a conference that went on, a hacking conference called 24C3.

514
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:15,440
And it's, I guess, an annual four-day conference organized by a hacking group called Chaos

515
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:21,840
Computer Club, where, of course, thousands of hackers and scientists, artists, et cetera,

516
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:22,840
gather.

517
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:29,840
So, one of the things that they showed off was that they have completely hacked the Wii.

518
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,480
This is an unmodded Wii.

519
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:35,280
They are managed, well, I shouldn't say it's unmodded, but there's no mod ship running

520
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,280
in it.

521
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:41,320
And they've, using a specially made disk and a kind of a serial port thing, they called

522
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:49,120
it a tweezer attack, they were able to run homebrew software in Wii mode.

523
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:55,360
Usually before that, they've only been able to do it through the GameCube operating system

524
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,920
or whatever on there.

525
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:02,000
It's all been limited to GameCube kind of homebrew stuff, but now they have access to

526
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:07,440
the full Wii stuff and within a matter of time, we're going to see a lot more Wii homebrew

527
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,440
out there.

528
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,000
So, I guess that's a good thing.

529
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,040
If you're interested, though, there is a YouTube video out there that shows kind of the whole

530
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,040
demonstration.

531
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:21,800
It's pretty much, they have like, I guess, a modded Lego Star Wars complete saga disk

532
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:26,560
and they used, they ran some program that showed like, you know, kind of the coordinates

533
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:31,720
of your Wii pointer and you could start and stop the drives and stuff like that.

534
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:34,040
That reminds me of something that I saw on YouTube.

535
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,760
I have a feeling we're thinking of the same thing.

536
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,760
Go ahead.

537
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:39,120
The guy did the target placing.

538
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,800
That is the same thing I'm thinking of.

539
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,800
Wasn't that shit amazing?

540
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:42,800
That was pretty cool.

541
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,300
Did you see that YouTube?

542
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:48,480
The guy, and I can't remember his name, I'm sorry, maybe somebody in chat remembers, but

543
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:53,840
he was a student at some school and he put together this thing where he swapped the Wiimote

544
00:32:53,840 --> 00:33:01,240
and the sensor bar to create this, you know, the television instead of looking like, you

545
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,880
know, a normal Wii game, it looked like a portal into another world.

546
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:07,840
He didn't use the sensor bar itself, he actually used two infrareds attached to goggles.

547
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,840
Okay, sorry, same concept.

548
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,840
Because the sensor bar itself has an infrared reflect.

549
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,640
Right, and he put them in the glasses.

550
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,800
And it was basically, this YouTube is amazing, it's had over a million views, I'm sure most

551
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:20,600
of you have seen it, but it was basically, he kind of called out a lot of the game developers

552
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:24,640
in it and said, hey, if you want to do something this cool, you know, give me a call or you

553
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,640
should do it.

554
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,320
You know, I just told you how to do it.

555
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:32,680
So it looked amazing, just even in the little YouTube, the way, oh wow.

556
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:36,200
It was, yeah, it was like a head tracking, a VR head tracking is what it is, they have

557
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:43,320
that right now for like flight sims, like they're showing flight sim 10 or whatever,

558
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:48,280
you can do that and you can actually do it where it will, I don't know.

559
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,000
That was not a hacking thing this guy did.

560
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:55,280
Well, he made his own custom program, but you know, still, the hardware he used was

561
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:58,240
all pretty much, you know, stuff that could easily be done.

562
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,240
It just looked amazing.

563
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:04,200
Well, you can, how was it, adjust, I guess scale it so you don't have to look completely

564
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:08,920
behind you to look behind you and stuff like that, but yeah, it's pretty cool.

565
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:14,040
And he had some other things too, like on how to make like a VR, like whiteboard type

566
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,080
thing and some other stuff.

567
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,080
Wow.

568
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:27,840
So, anyways, other things to note here, some that may not be too happy unfortunately and

569
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:32,800
I hate to be the one to mention this, but I'm just gonna say it, this hasn't really

570
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:40,320
been out there that much, or actually it hasn't been out there yet, this news, but, let me

571
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:46,200
just say it I guess, it is a very likely situation that Smash Brothers may have been delayed

572
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:49,320
another month.

573
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,840
And where is this coming from?

574
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:58,720
I just happened to see a date change in our system for March now for Smash Brothers.

575
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,300
So it could just be an anomaly?

576
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:02,680
It could be an anomaly, it could be one of those things.

577
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:07,760
Now here's why I think it might be true though, because they're running into, I guess, there

578
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:14,460
are so many places that they can manufacture Wii Dis, and right now they're at full production

579
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:18,620
and because of that, a lot of games are getting delayed because they can't manufacture this

580
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:21,200
in time.

581
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:26,960
And they've said a few months ago that all Wii games and some DS games will be affected

582
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:35,260
by this, and so being that the case, one of two things could be happening here, one, distribution

583
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:39,880
may not be getting their copies, but retail will be, if there's going to be a shortage

584
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:43,160
like that, if they're anticipating that there's going to be a shortage, they're going to delay

585
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:47,480
it for everybody else for a month, or it really is delayed a month.

586
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:53,960
So right now, just don't be surprised if you see that news come out, but I wouldn't confirm

587
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,960
it 100% yet.

588
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:56,960
Interesting.

589
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,960
I don't know.

590
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:03,160
Now as some folks are hoping, could it be that they've delayed it to add Mega Man?

591
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,880
I doubt that.

592
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:09,560
Didn't the guy who made Mega Man come out this week and say Mega Man is not in Smash

593
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,560
Bros?

594
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,560
I don't remember.

595
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,560
I'm almost positive I read a story about that.

596
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,640
Everyone thought that the 20th anniversary of Mega Man they were in announced that Mega

597
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:16,640
Man was going to be in there.

598
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,680
I would like Mega Man in there, I think that'd be pretty awesome, but I don't think that's

599
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:20,680
going to happen.

600
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:25,080
And Color of Sakura also points out in their chatroom that Brawl already went gold in Japan.

601
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,080
Yeah.

602
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,080
So that's good.

603
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:30,560
Well, it's rumored that it went gold in Japan.

604
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:35,800
It's not official yet, because that was some website that is in production or whatever.

605
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:39,440
But it's not official yet, by any means.

606
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:44,620
Brack2000 speculates if they are going to come out and announce this delay, again, many

607
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:48,220
of the things Loki said is true, it could be an anomaly, it could be the distribution

608
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:50,680
only is getting delayed or what have you.

609
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,800
Brack2000 has an interesting thought here.

610
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:57,360
I wonder if they'll announce this delay with a huge announcement like last time with Sonic.

611
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,840
Like good news to soften the blow?

612
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:05,000
Here's the thing though, and this is the only reason why I think it might be true, any time

613
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,420
that we've been delayed product or whatever, like say, oh we're not going to ship you this

614
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:12,880
much or whatever, they didn't change the street date, they just, here's the date for this,

615
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:17,480
oh by the way, you're not getting any until this time.

616
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:22,720
I doubt they would change the date, but I'm just saying, it's about a month, I think March

617
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:23,720
9th is what we showed.

618
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:24,720
Keep us posted.

619
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:25,720
We'll see, I'll keep you posted.

620
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,720
You heard it here first.

621
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,840
But guess, I was going to mention one other thing.

622
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:37,960
There's two other games actually that, it's funny because some games might not be only

623
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:42,920
on Xbox 360, one we'll probably be talking about a little bit later of course, or we're

624
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:50,200
talking about quite a while ago, our wonderful game that involves rolling certain things

625
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,440
around.

626
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:57,380
It's still showing in our system, and it's actually moved dates the other week, sometime

627
00:37:57,380 --> 00:38:04,360
around say, April-ish, so it's still very possible that that's actually coming out.

628
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,360
Interesting.

629
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,360
Yeah.

630
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:09,640
Could you, I could totally picture a gold edition with all the downloadable content

631
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:13,520
included in the game, just like Marvel Ultimate Alliance or something like that.

632
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,520
That'd be interesting.

633
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,520
Totally see that coming.

634
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:20,720
And then let's see here, I was going to mention one other thing real quick, Silent Hill Origins,

635
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:25,600
that was coming out on PlayStation 2 in Japan, it is coming out over here too.

636
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:28,280
Actually sooner than later, March.

637
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,280
Nice!

638
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,920
Very excited about that, you know, because I didn't play too much of the PSP version,

639
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:35,560
but PlayStation 2, that might be pretty cool.

640
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:39,800
Even though I guess I could plug in my PSP to my TV and do the same thing.

641
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:43,680
Finally, let's see here, what else we've got.

642
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:52,200
Oh, the DS, it's actually sold quite a bit of units in Japan, so much so that it's actually

643
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:56,720
outsold the PlayStation 2 over the course of its lifetime.

644
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:01,720
So that's pretty cool, hasn't done it in the U.S. though yet.

645
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:09,000
And then finally, the original Nights game on Nights Into Dreams will be coming to Game

646
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,840
Tap in 2008.

647
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:14,680
I've been playing that already.

648
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,800
You do Christmas nights this time of year, right?

649
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,800
I do Christmas nights.

650
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:18,800
Good times?

651
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:19,800
Very hard to watch on my TV.

652
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:23,640
Jamie, you've got a story for us real quick, and then we're going to open up the Skype

653
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:24,640
line.

654
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:30,280
So 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, call in and talk to us

655
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,680
about the year 2007.

656
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:38,560
This is more of a humor thing, because I think it's pretty damn funny, is that Nokia's N-Gage

657
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:45,120
first access platform has been delayed, and it's not going to be out in time for the holidays.

658
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:51,040
It was going to work on the Nokia N81 and N81A gigabyte phone for games and other types

659
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:57,040
of fun stuff, and they said that they ran into a little glitch while running it through

660
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,040
global testing.

661
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:01,400
So it's not there, like anyone cares.

662
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:08,880
I know what I was going to say, I'm sure all of America and the rest of the world, frankly,

663
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:09,880
is disappointed.

664
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:10,880
Phantom?

665
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:11,880
Yeah, by this news.

666
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,160
What ever happened to the fucking Phantom?

667
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,240
The lap board came out.

668
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,240
Really?

669
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,240
Yeah.

670
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,800
So it went from being console to lap board?

671
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,800
Yeah.

672
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:20,800
Interesting.

673
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,720
I didn't think the console was going to work when they were showing it off.

674
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,800
Oh my god, because it was just a PC, I'm like, I don't get this.

675
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,800
Who would download PC games?

676
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:33,680
Apparently Steam worked, so I was wrong there, but still, I mean, I don't know.

677
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:39,400
If they had a console that was just Steam, that might be pretty cool, maybe.

678
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:43,560
Well our Skype line is open, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

679
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,640
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

680
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:51,480
Please remember though, if you're going to call us on Skype, give our test call a call

681
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,480
first.

682
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:56,400
That's ECHO123 on Skype, and that way you don't sound like shit when you get through

683
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,400
on the Skype line.

684
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:00,520
And what we're going to do is we're going to recap some of the stories that we went

685
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:06,840
over this year in the various months of the year, and I'll explain how that works as soon

686
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,840
as we take our first call.

687
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,840
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

688
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,000
Who's this?

689
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
This is Ravenstaufen.

690
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Can you hear me?

691
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
I can hear you, sir.

692
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,320
How are you?

693
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,320
I am fine.

694
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:19,020
Well god damn if it wouldn't be a year in review show if we didn't have you here, Ravenstaufen,

695
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:20,160
so I appreciate you calling in.

696
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,640
How are you doing?

697
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:22,640
I'm doing fine.

698
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,980
I'm playing Mario Galaxy just like you are.

699
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:26,640
Isn't it fucking great?

700
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,440
I do think it's fucking great.

701
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,440
I really do.

702
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,440
Excellent.

703
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,640
Well, go ahead.

704
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:36,200
The thing about Mario Galaxy that impresses me is the graphics.

705
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,600
I know the Wii is a piece of shit.

706
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:42,200
That's what some people say, but I really think that the Wii can pull off some really

707
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,200
good graphics.

708
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:47,800
You know, and we've said it before on this show, Nintendo loves to have aces in their

709
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:53,740
sleeves, and their systems always have these little hidden features and are probably capable

710
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:56,600
of much more than people usually give them credit for originally.

711
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,480
That's how they extend the life of their systems.

712
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:01,640
So I'm sure you have not seen the best looking Wii game yet.

713
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:04,160
Yeah, but this one is pretty good.

714
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:09,680
I really like what they did with the little effects, the little twinkles, and the little

715
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:13,760
things you go in the air, you see little things here and there.

716
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:14,760
The water shines.

717
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:20,440
Well, something to keep in mind too, Ravenstaufen, is that Mario Galaxy was not a ported GameCube

718
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,440
game, either.

719
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,440
You know what I mean?

720
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:27,640
It's truly an original game, and I think that's part of what made it stand out.

721
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:30,040
But it is colorful, so that's what I'm going to say.

722
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:34,760
Well, Raven, we're going to ask you to help us kind of recap the year here a little bit.

723
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,040
We're going to kind of go month by month.

724
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:39,440
I'm going to tell you about some of the top stories we went over, and I'd like to hear

725
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:43,840
your thoughts on what you thought was really the standout story from that month.

726
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:44,840
Sound good?

727
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,480
Oh, I was waiting for this, yeah.

728
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:49,000
All right, then we'll get your best and worst game of the year at the end.

729
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:53,680
So let's take a trip all the way back to January, and January started off with Orange

730
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:54,680
Honors Radio episode 215.

731
00:42:54,680 --> 00:43:01,160
In episode 215, one of the headlines we talked about was that E3's replacement was announced,

732
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:06,960
and E3 was going to be replaced with E for All Expo, and of course we say replaced with,

733
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:07,960
we mean the...

734
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:08,960
Loosely.

735
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:12,520
Yeah, kind of loosely, because obviously we had many E3 happen a little later in the year,

736
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:17,560
but in the very first week of 2007, we learned about the E for All Expo was kind of first

737
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:18,560
announced.

738
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:23,720
In episode number 216, the top story from that week was a woman right here in the city

739
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:28,960
that we broadcast from in Rancho Cordova, California.

740
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:35,880
The woman died in our local radio station, 107.9's Hold Your Wee for a Wee contest, and

741
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:40,800
I see Jamie rolled her eyes and sighed when she heard about that.

742
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:47,760
Why are they rolling me the eyes and sighing, if I wasn't already sick, I'd be sick?

743
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:51,560
It is a very tragic thing, and I remember that you didn't do a show that week when that

744
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:52,560
story broke.

745
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:53,560
That's right.

746
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:54,560
We only did three shows in January.

747
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,800
I don't remember what happened, but we were off for a week in January.

748
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:57,800
I was at Disneyland.

749
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:58,800
You were at Disney...

750
00:43:58,800 --> 00:43:59,800
Oh, we both were at Disneyland.

751
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:00,800
I was at Disneyland.

752
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:01,800
That's what it was.

753
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:03,840
That was my first trip to Disneyland a long time, so we were off, I think it was Martin

754
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:06,960
Luther King weekend, and that's the weekend it all went down.

755
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:10,760
You're right, we weren't on that week, and we came back and we were just like, you know,

756
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:14,920
if you think it's bad on the internet, try living here, where it's all going down.

757
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:18,960
Sorry, you were doing your little guys on the show, and you recapped it there.

758
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:26,960
I think that I was just whole surprised that no one had ever heard of drinking too much

759
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:27,960
water.

760
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:33,720
It was so funny, because I remember especially in Sacramento, the area where we live, there's

761
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:35,520
only been so many...

762
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:36,520
There has not been...

763
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:38,040
I don't have a number.

764
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:42,560
There have not been that many water deaths in this country, but there have been multiple

765
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:46,320
ones in the Sacramento region in the past couple of years, because there was the frat

766
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:49,080
kid at Chico State, which is where I went to school.

767
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:50,400
That's only like 90 minutes north of here.

768
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:53,800
There was that frat kid who, as part of the initiation, had to drink all that water, and

769
00:44:53,800 --> 00:45:01,160
he died of water intoxication, which is what caught the DJs in a lot of fire in the whole

770
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:05,820
station, which, by the way, unlike I predicted earlier in the year, I believe when the story

771
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:09,040
first launched, 107.9 is still the end.

772
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:11,140
It's still owned by the same people.

773
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:13,080
They have a new morning program in place now.

774
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:17,360
I don't remember what they're called, but they have other wacky morning DJs on there

775
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:21,960
doing their thing, and same old stick, but with different people.

776
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:26,880
Well, I think it was good that the ones that were in charge of that got fired, because

777
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:33,480
honestly, I guess the majority of people in the world just don't know better.

778
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:39,880
I'm not going to go into my whole stupid people, including the gene pool thing, but still Darwin's

779
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:42,680
theory had some merit.

780
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:46,640
Episode number 217 in January, we only did three shows in January.

781
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:50,440
Episode 215, one of the top headlines that week was the news channel launched on the

782
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:52,280
Nintendo Wii.

783
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:57,440
You might remember when the Nintendo Wii first came out last year, we had the weather channel

784
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:58,920
was forthcoming in the news channel.

785
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:03,020
The news channel finally launched in January, and the reason why it's kind of noteworthy

786
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:09,040
is because it was a game console doing something pretty major other than games.

787
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,720
And it was the news channel.

788
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:15,760
I have not watched the news channel ever, ever, ever.

789
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,720
Does anybody actually use the news channel?

790
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:18,720
How about chat?

791
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:21,520
Does anybody in chat use the news channel?

792
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:22,520
Complete waste of time.

793
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:24,200
We should be able to remove that crap.

794
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:25,960
Raven, do you use the news channel?

795
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:29,360
I used it when it first came out, and do you remember what the first headline when you

796
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:31,520
went to technology was?

797
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:36,200
Was that, wasn't it the woman dying from the Wii, or what?

798
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:39,280
No, it was the PlayStation 3 launching in Japan, in Europe.

799
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:40,920
I remember that, that's right.

800
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:42,920
Wow, you got a good memory, that's right.

801
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:47,800
I remember I was amused because the first story I brought up in the technology was a

802
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:49,640
story about the PlayStation 3 launching.

803
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:54,200
I'm like, I'm reading about the PlayStation 3 on my Wii, this is weird.

804
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:56,280
Feels like an oxymoron, doesn't it?

805
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:59,720
Act Def says my brother does use it daily.

806
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:01,900
Color of Sakura says I have used the channel.

807
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:05,760
Mac Man says I use the new channel to wipe my ass.

808
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:08,040
I don't use the channel at all.

809
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:11,840
I think I looked at it once, and I went like, ah, don't eat it.

810
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:18,960
I use it once in a while just kind of to spin the globe, and check out, because like sometimes

811
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:22,840
you really want to know what's going on, and like, you know.

812
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:26,240
I just want to spin the globe and make everyone dizzy, yay!

813
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:27,240
Exactly.

814
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:29,920
Well, Raven, out of those stories, what do you think was probably the most impactful

815
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:32,480
in the game industry in January, and why?

816
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:37,160
The one about the Wii water one, when you cold your Wii for a Wii, because that didn't

817
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:39,960
go away quite fast.

818
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:43,280
It kept on going, lawsuits, people aren't suing Nintendo, all of that.

819
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:46,340
Yeah, but everyone forgot about it, like long after.

820
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:48,080
It lingered like a bad snow.

821
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:49,080
Seriously.

822
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:50,080
Just like some other ones.

823
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:53,280
I don't know, because it seemed like that story came up a couple of times, because then

824
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,480
like, you know, the family was going to sue Nintendo.

825
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:57,000
I remember that was a big follow-up story.

826
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Yeah, because they're stupid.

827
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,740
And that's ridiculous, because Nintendo didn't have anything to do with it other than making

828
00:48:00,740 --> 00:48:01,740
the product.

829
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:05,200
Oh, God, stupid people irritate the shit out of me.

830
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:08,600
Because they made the product, they engineered the desire for the product.

831
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:11,480
To be fair, they didn't actually sue Nintendo.

832
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:16,360
It was an exploratory thing, they were thinking of doing it, and they decided not to, so intelligence

833
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:17,360
did prevail.

834
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:18,360
Even considering it is stupid.

835
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:19,360
All right.

836
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:21,960
Because they know they'll get anywhere, nowhere with Nintendo.

837
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:22,960
All right.

838
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:25,240
Well, Raven, let's go ahead and do another month.

839
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:29,440
We'll let everybody do two months, because we're kind of low on people tonight, so you

840
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:32,480
want to continue to adventure with us into February, Raven?

841
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:33,480
It's fine by me.

842
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:34,480
All right.

843
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,260
Episode 218 started off February.

844
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:40,400
A games as porn bill failed in the state of Utah.

845
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:44,400
Yeah, especially the games they're out now, I would not consider those porn.

846
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:45,400
Geez.

847
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:46,400
Yes, that's right.

848
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:50,640
Utah was going to, at one point, put some of the adult games, basically regulate it

849
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:52,680
the same way they did porn.

850
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:53,960
But that bill failed in early January.

851
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:56,360
That makes absolutely no sense to this day.

852
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:59,560
I still think to myself, okay, Mario has porn.

853
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:01,920
That's a great idea, Utah.

854
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:04,600
Now Manhunt 2, though, is Manhunt 2 porn?

855
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:05,600
Nope.

856
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:06,680
To them, it is.

857
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:08,880
In a way, though, it may not be porn.

858
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:12,920
But of course, I've said this before, anything you could say about Manhunt 2 and how bad

859
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:16,680
it is for society, I go, Saw 4.

860
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:18,280
I'll say this about Manhunt 2.

861
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:19,280
What?

862
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:22,520
When I first heard Manhunt 2 was going to release, and when I looked at it, say Nintendo

863
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:23,880
Wii, I had to do a double shot.

864
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:27,800
I'm like, it's coming out for the PlayStation 2, PSP, and Nintendo Wii, I'm like, Nintendo

865
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:28,800
Wii?

866
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:29,800
All right.

867
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:34,760
Well, moving on through the month, Episode 219, one of the stick-out stories from that

868
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:42,240
episode, Codemasters had to replace faulty Bubble Bobble DS cartridges when the boss

869
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:46,400
in Level 30 didn't fucking show up.

870
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,240
You gotta love it.

871
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:53,680
And endless jokes for years and years here on this program when that happened.

872
00:49:53,680 --> 00:50:00,160
Episode number 220, an insider in the gaming industry went on to PartnerNet, which is Xbox

873
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:05,800
Live's kind of staging area for Xbox Live, and spilled the beans on some of the upcoming

874
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:08,520
releases including Jetpack and Tetris Online.

875
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:12,600
But what should also be noted is that this news came all the way back from February,

876
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:17,760
and there were some other game titles that we never saw, like Juiced 2007 and Ob's Pinball.

877
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:23,160
Of course, a game like Ob's Pinball could have become the Pinball FX game that we did

878
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:24,160
yet.

879
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:27,240
Juice 2007 is just Juice 2 Hot Import Nights.

880
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:34,560
Oh, and it wasn't an actual arcade game or what have you, it was download content for

881
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:35,560
an existing game.

882
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:39,640
But nevertheless, this story was important because it was kind of a sign of people on

883
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:46,480
the inside, you know, kind of spilling the beans and getting all the secrets out there.

884
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:49,420
Those people suck.

885
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:54,520
Episode number 221, the last show we did in February, was the week that Warhawk was announced

886
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:58,080
that it was only going to be a downloadable title on the PlayStation 3.

887
00:50:58,080 --> 00:50:59,080
Well, it was ruined.

888
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:00,080
Was it ruined?

889
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:05,760
No, it was confirmed for a while, and then they came back and said, but we're also going

890
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:09,200
to release it on Blu-Ray with the headset and all this stuff.

891
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:12,960
So that was the week, though, that Warhawk was originally announced as a download-only

892
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:19,280
title, which was big because, you know, obviously this was one of the games that Sony was pushing

893
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:22,080
and pushing when they first showed off the PlayStation 3.

894
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:25,480
And for this to kind of go back, you know, and say, well, we're just going to make it

895
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:27,080
a download-only game was kind of...

896
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:29,240
Six axis, all that stuff was going to be in it.

897
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:34,160
I'll never forget when they were showing off the six axis and he was trying to land the

898
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:38,760
jet on, like, the actual carrier thing, and it almost, like, tipped it off the edge of

899
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:41,160
the cliff because he didn't land it right.

900
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:42,160
That's hilarious.

901
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:43,920
That's what I'll remember, Warhawk.

902
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:49,800
All right, so Raven, we have Games as Porn in Utah, Bubble Bobble broken, PartnerNet

903
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:53,800
spills the beans, and Warhawk download-only on PlayStation 3.

904
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:56,920
What do you think had the most impact from February, the longest lasting impression on

905
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:58,880
2007 for gaming?

906
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:01,860
Of course, Bubble Bobble, how do you expect?

907
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:06,400
There's a game that the bosses show up, you're like, well, like, come on, boss, come out,

908
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:08,720
I need you, and you just never showed up.

909
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:13,080
Or how about the fact that, did anybody test this game?

910
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:16,120
There's no testers in Codemasters, that's hilarious.

911
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:19,600
Apparently not, and it's kind of sad because I have a lot of friends who have been game

912
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:23,240
testers that do very good jobs, you know, for various companies that they've worked

913
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:27,840
for, and it was just kind of sad when, you know, this kind of gave game testers everywhere

914
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:30,720
a bad name that something like this slipped through the cracks.

915
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:35,880
But obviously this was management cutting corners to meet some deadlines, and probably

916
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:39,600
the game did not go through the extensive testing it should have, right?

917
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:45,720
Yeah, but it just, to me, it just boggles the mind how the boss never showed up.

918
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:48,120
I mean, how do you miss that?

919
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:49,120
I don't know.

920
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:50,120
Good question.

921
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:53,680
Chat Room and Loki and Dark Soccer, do you guys agree with Raven's picks?

922
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:57,200
You think the Wii for a Wii and the Bubble Bobble were probably the biggest stories out

923
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:58,200
of those months?

924
00:52:58,200 --> 00:52:59,200
Yeah.

925
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:00,200
Yeah, I guess.

926
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:01,200
Yeah.

927
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:02,200
All right.

928
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:07,600
Well, Raven, while we get the Chat Room's impressions of your picks there, why don't

929
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:12,080
you tell us what, in your opinion, and you can use any criteria you want, you don't have

930
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:15,280
to listen to what the critics say or what anybody else says but yourself, what, in your

931
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:21,520
opinion, was the worst game of 2007, the game that everybody should stay the hell away from?

932
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:24,000
Please stay the hell away of this one game.

933
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:28,200
I swear to you, it's free, but it's not even more free.

934
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:30,320
Yaris for the 360.

935
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:31,320
Just stay away.

936
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:34,760
Toyota Yaris on the 360, the worst game of 2007.

937
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:38,040
Free and the robotic claw didn't do anything for you?

938
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:39,040
Oh my God.

939
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:40,800
I want my time back.

940
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:41,800
I don't want my money.

941
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:44,480
I want my time back for that.

942
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:47,840
Best game of 2007, in your opinion, Raven?

943
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:48,960
Just one?

944
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:49,960
Just one.

945
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:53,100
You can tell us what some of your runner-ups would be, but we just want to know your number

946
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:54,100
one game.

947
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:55,100
That's the only one we're writing down.

948
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:56,100
Let's see.

949
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:57,100
I guess I'll go with Galaxy.

950
00:53:57,100 --> 00:54:00,160
I really enjoy that.

951
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:01,160
I really enjoy it.

952
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:06,120
Even one of those games that just shows off the Wii and just puts everything in a nice

953
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:10,520
package going, Nintendo did something.

954
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:11,880
Anything kind of close for you?

955
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:15,600
Oh, there's a lot of things close, like Bioshock and Call of Duty 4.

956
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:17,320
You can't complain with those.

957
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:19,640
Overall, was it a good year for games, Ravenstaufen?

958
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:22,280
Overall, it's a great year for games.

959
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:23,760
I compare it to 2004.

960
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:27,400
What was so hot about 2004, remind us?

961
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:29,560
We had Grand Theft Auto, San Andreas.

962
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:30,760
We had Halo 2.

963
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:33,320
We had Half-Life 2.

964
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:35,280
We had God of War 1.

965
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:36,840
All those games came out in that year.

966
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:37,840
All right.

967
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:40,760
Well, Ravenstaufen, thanks so much for reflecting on the year with us.

968
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:42,560
We appreciate it, all right?

969
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:43,880
Thank you for having me on.

970
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:44,880
You are welcome, sir.

971
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:45,880
I appreciate it.

972
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:46,880
Best of luck in 2008.

973
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:48,440
We'll continue to hear from you in the year, right?

974
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:49,440
You bet.

975
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:50,440
All right.

976
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:51,440
Take care, buddy.

977
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:52,440
Bye.

978
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:57,160
If you want to give us a call and help us out in March and April, give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

979
00:54:57,160 --> 00:55:05,280
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, and I'm trying to look at some of the comments

980
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:06,280
in the chat room here.

981
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:10,960
DarkZombie says, I demand Yaris 2 for Xbox Live Arcade.

982
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:13,400
ShadowSlayer says, Bubble Bobble is the best game ever.

983
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:17,640
I'm assuming he means the original, not the newer one.

984
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:20,560
Let's go to the phones and see who's going to join us for the next part of the show.

985
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:21,560
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

986
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:22,560
Who's this?

987
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:25,400
This is DJ Darknight in house.

988
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:26,840
Hey, DJ Darknight.

989
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:27,840
How are you doing, my friend?

990
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:28,840
I'm all right.

991
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:30,560
How about y'all guys tonight?

992
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:31,560
I am excellent.

993
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:32,560
Hi.

994
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:36,960
So, Darknight, are you ready to reflect on some of the previous months here in 2007?

995
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:40,840
Yeah, I wanted to kind of follow up on that bubble ball thing, but it might be a little

996
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:41,840
bit later on.

997
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:42,840
Go ahead.

998
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:43,840
Go ahead, sir.

999
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:50,280
There was another DS game that had that same problem, and it was SNK versus Capcom Car

1000
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:51,280
Fighter.

1001
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:54,480
Yeah, the one card that wouldn't... Yeah, I remember that.

1002
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:57,240
And get past the thing because the game would lock up or something.

1003
00:55:57,240 --> 00:56:00,280
Like a card didn't... Yeah, a card froze the game or something.

1004
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:01,280
That's right.

1005
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:05,680
So, it was interesting that that bubble ball thing kind of started to trend, sadly.

1006
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:06,680
Yeah.

1007
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:07,680
All right.

1008
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:10,520
That one really hurt everybody for a while.

1009
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:15,080
Hopefully lessons learned by all gaming companies in regards to testing your games for 2008.

1010
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:17,880
Well, let's talk about March and April.

1011
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:24,120
Starting off in March, episode number 222 kicked off March, and that was when Sony actually

1012
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:25,640
... This happened a little bit before.

1013
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:31,100
The details were leaked before the Game Developers Conference, but episode 222, the first week

1014
00:56:31,100 --> 00:56:34,520
of March was when we really started getting the details on PlayStation Home.

1015
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:38,680
And I think the thing about PlayStation Home was it kind of made our collective jaws drop

1016
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:42,600
a little bit because at this point, a lot of us had really written off the PlayStation

1017
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:45,720
3 as the joke of this generation.

1018
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:49,720
And then when PlayStation Home was announced, a lot of us kind of turned our heads and went,

1019
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:50,720
really?

1020
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:51,720
Really now?

1021
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:52,720
This looks interesting.

1022
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:53,720
Yeah, it looks interesting.

1023
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:54,720
I wish it would come out now.

1024
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:55,720
Yeah.

1025
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:56,720
Someday.

1026
00:56:56,720 --> 00:57:00,120
Of course, now as we know, the damn thing still hasn't come out, but as I said before,

1027
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:01,920
I think Sony's spreading themselves too thin.

1028
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:06,280
I think Home is still a great idea, and I can't wait to see it in 2008 or whenever it

1029
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:07,280
finally comes out.

1030
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:08,280
Yeah.

1031
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:09,280
I don't know.

1032
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:13,960
Dark Knight, do you think PlayStation Home is worthy of selling PlayStation 3s?

1033
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:14,960
I don't know.

1034
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:17,240
I mean, it's a good idea.

1035
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:23,640
They try to give some second life feel to it and everything like that, but I don't think

1036
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:24,640
it'll do it.

1037
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:25,640
I don't think it'll work.

1038
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:27,040
I don't think it'll do much good.

1039
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:29,880
We'll see in 2008 when the thing finally comes out.

1040
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:34,000
People like making their avatars and stuff, and to be honest, I wish Home was something

1041
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:39,040
that Nintendo was doing with the Miis, because I think that would have really launched that

1042
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:40,040
console.

1043
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:42,920
I mean, not that they really needed any help selling the console, but it would have launched

1044
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:45,840
it even further had they had difficulty or anything like that.

1045
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:46,840
Yeah.

1046
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:50,280
It would have worked on Nintendo maybe, but like I said, I can't see it as Sony.

1047
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:51,280
It may have worked.

1048
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:52,280
It would have worked on Nintendo.

1049
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:55,880
But Home, I think, is one of those things, though, it looks good on paper, but I don't

1050
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:58,520
know how it's actually going to translate once they've built it.

1051
00:57:58,520 --> 00:57:59,520
Yeah.

1052
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:03,480
Well, let's move on with March, episode number 223.

1053
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:07,720
Microsoft upped the arcade limit and subsequently the memory card sizes.

1054
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:11,800
You might remember Xbox Live arcade games were limited to 50 megabytes, and at the Game

1055
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:15,240
Developers Conference, I believe, Microsoft announced that they were going to be upping

1056
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:19,740
the arcade limit, which allowed some more titles to come out that were much bigger,

1057
00:58:19,740 --> 00:58:23,080
such as Castlevania Symphony of the Night, I believe, was the first one that broke the

1058
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:24,080
50 meg limit.

1059
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:26,200
It was something like 90 megs.

1060
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:31,680
And obviously, the memory card sizes had to be upgraded as well, which I certainly don't

1061
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:34,200
think anybody sees this as a bad decision by Microsoft.

1062
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:36,760
It was probably one they should have made a while ago.

1063
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:39,780
Why they ever limited it in the first place was a little weird, but I guess it was because

1064
00:58:39,780 --> 00:58:40,780
of the memory cards.

1065
00:58:40,780 --> 00:58:45,360
Yeah, because I mean, and I don't think that many people actually bought them, like talking

1066
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:46,360
about it.

1067
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:50,400
Most of the people bought the 512 one only because it came with geometry wars in it.

1068
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,640
Oh, I guess that's a good point.

1069
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:56,440
Or you know, you just, you have the core and the memory cards all you need.

1070
00:58:56,440 --> 00:59:00,320
Like you know, I think most of the hardcore gamers like you and I and probably most of

1071
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:04,520
the people that, you know, seek out gaming podcasts and therefore listen to this program,

1072
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:07,340
we probably all understand why you need a hard drive.

1073
00:59:07,340 --> 00:59:11,800
But for those people that bought their Xbox 360s just so they could play Madden, you know,

1074
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:15,940
have it be their party machine, I suppose, you know, memory cards are what they're going

1075
00:59:15,940 --> 00:59:18,440
to buy because that's what they're used to from PlayStation.

1076
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:19,440
Right.

1077
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:20,440
Right.

1078
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:25,480
Well, and plus, like I said, the last system I remember, you know, the other system I had

1079
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:29,060
that had a hard drive in it was the Sega Saturn.

1080
00:59:29,060 --> 00:59:33,240
So it was kind of like a take back when it saw that the 360, the newer systems would

1081
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:34,240
have that.

1082
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:35,960
What about the old school Xbox, though?

1083
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:38,560
The first Xbox, they all had hard drives built in.

1084
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:39,560
Yeah.

1085
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:40,560
Oh, yeah, that's right.

1086
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:41,560
I forgot they did.

1087
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:42,560
Yeah.

1088
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:43,560
Xbox One had hard drive.

1089
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:48,120
Ironically enough, Xbox One didn't really use the hard drive, though, like it should

1090
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:49,120
have.

1091
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:54,720
It almost seems like Microsoft, when they originally conceptualized the original Xbox,

1092
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:57,720
wanted to do some of the things from the very beginning that they didn't do until the Xbox

1093
00:59:57,720 --> 00:59:58,720
360.

1094
00:59:58,720 --> 00:59:59,720
It almost feels like that way.

1095
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:00,720
Right?

1096
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:01,720
Yeah.

1097
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:02,720
I don't know.

1098
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:03,720
I mean, it's just me.

1099
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:04,720
Of course.

1100
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:05,720
I think most of the people used it just to record music.

1101
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:08,600
Just use their music and play CDs and whatnot and save it to the hard drive.

1102
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:10,520
That's really all you could use it for.

1103
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:11,520
Yeah.

1104
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:12,520
Well.

1105
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:13,520
Don't think.

1106
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:14,520
Yeah.

1107
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:17,880
Episode number 224 in March was pretty epic.

1108
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:24,360
I swear to God, I looked at the list of stories we covered that week, and this really was

1109
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:29,840
the one that kind of stuck out as the most relevant to what was going on in the games

1110
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:31,440
industry in general at that time.

1111
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:37,320
That is, episode 224 was the week that Loki revealed on this very program that there was

1112
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:41,240
a game coming out called Beautiful Katamari that was going to be coming out later in the

1113
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:42,240
year.

1114
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:48,160
And the reason why I picked that is not necessarily the announcement itself, but all the fall

1115
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:49,160
out.

1116
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:50,160
The backlash.

1117
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:55,600
The backlash that came from that because it definitely kind of showed A, can the independent

1118
01:00:55,600 --> 01:01:01,400
media be trusted, and who are these guys, and dah, dah, dah, and kind of B, when Namco

1119
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:05,480
obviously, as most people know, it's not a very big secret now, now that the game's out,

1120
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:09,740
I think we can talk a little more openly about this, Namco putteth the smacketh down a little

1121
01:01:09,740 --> 01:01:14,920
bit and there wasn't a lot we could do because we are an independent organization, because

1122
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:19,880
this is something that is run out of our spare times, and because of the fact that we don't

1123
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:26,580
have the mogul media companies to back us up and say, we're going to go fight you in

1124
01:01:26,580 --> 01:01:29,240
court over this, freedom of the press, blah, blah, blah.

1125
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:32,760
We had to run away with our tail between our legs, and it kind of sucked.

1126
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:36,600
It was, like I said, it wasn't the first time, remember the controversy with Kotaku and Sony

1127
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:41,840
and how they said something about Sony, and Sony threatened to basically stop backing

1128
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:47,520
them, and the community was up in arms about it, and they was up in arms about it, and

1129
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:52,200
Sony was like, okay, okay, okay, we'll bend, we'll bend, we'll bend.

1130
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:56,720
It hurt, it was just, nothing's worse than a community scorn.

1131
01:01:56,720 --> 01:02:03,440
But unfortunately, we don't have that same oomph that Kotaku has, it just kind of sucks,

1132
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:08,560
but it definitely was a very interesting thing to watch, I'm sure, you know, it was a hell

1133
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:11,680
of a thing to see from the inside, I'm sure on the outside it was probably pretty interesting

1134
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:12,680
too.

1135
01:02:12,680 --> 01:02:13,680
Oh yeah, oh yeah.

1136
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:16,680
Like I said, I mean, I do my own show, and I'm just like, oh, own show, I'm kind of sketchy

1137
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:21,240
on most of the release news, I'm like, eh, do I want to really touch that or no?

1138
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:25,880
Hey, I figured it's not that important anymore, especially since all the releases changed

1139
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:27,920
so much anyways.

1140
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:30,680
But I guess for whatever reason, they were really trying to keep that under wraps.

1141
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:32,400
Yeah, they were really trying to keep under wraps.

1142
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:34,840
Well, they didn't do a very good job, or we wouldn't have found it.

1143
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:38,040
Yeah, they were really, they should really keep it under wraps that a PlayStation 3 and

1144
01:02:38,040 --> 01:02:40,600
Wii version are coming out in April, that would really hurt.

1145
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:41,600
Welcome!

1146
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:42,600
You're awesome.

1147
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:43,600
We're going to jail.

1148
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:44,600
Alright.

1149
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:49,960
Views and opinions expressed by Loki, please don't sue us.

1150
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:54,160
Episode number 225, there was one more episode that came out in March, and that was the episode

1151
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:59,320
where Devil May Cry 4 was announced that it will no longer be a PlayStation 3 exclusive,

1152
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:05,040
and obviously that had a big impact because that kind of left Metal Gear Solid 4 and Final

1153
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:12,040
Fantasy 13 as the only real triple-A, super-grade-A PlayStation 3 exclusives left.

1154
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:16,080
I mean, this was huge the week that this one was announced, because it was like, oh my

1155
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:20,440
gosh, one of the big three just jumped ship, and it's now going to be Xbox 360.

1156
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:24,240
And now, flashing forward to where we're at now, not only is it also coming out on the

1157
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:29,920
Xbox 360, but they're making bundles out of it in Japan, the whole Devil May Cry bundles

1158
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:31,560
now are coming out.

1159
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:34,400
Devil May Cry for 360 if he doesn't get one.

1160
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:42,080
I mean, don't get me wrong, I saw a preview of the game in it, it's going to look good.

1161
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:44,040
It does look pretty awesome, I'm going to have to check it out.

1162
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:47,560
I've never really followed the Devil May Cry series that closely, but this game may have

1163
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:48,560
to make me change my mind.

1164
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:53,160
It has one thing going for it so far, the return of Trish.

1165
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:54,640
Jamie's happy.

1166
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:59,800
All right, well, Dark Knight, out of those four stories, the unveiling of PlayStation

1167
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:05,040
Home, Microsoft upping the arcade limit, beautiful Katamari being spoiled by us, and Devil May

1168
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:07,520
Cry 4 no longer being a PlayStation 3 exclusive.

1169
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:10,640
Which one do you think had the most impact in 2007?

1170
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:16,720
I'd say the Katamari spoiler thing, because like I said, it was just basically eye-opening

1171
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:21,840
to everybody that let them know that, yeah, this really not only could affect the big

1172
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:26,760
guys but it could affect the money guys and leak a story like that and have somebody go,

1173
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:28,220
no, you might want to...

1174
01:04:28,220 --> 01:04:33,520
And I know because of our announcement, those sales of Katamari have been so horrible just

1175
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:37,120
because of our announcement.

1176
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:38,360
You know what's weird?

1177
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:40,880
I actually wouldn't have picked the same story myself.

1178
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:41,880
I wouldn't have.

1179
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:44,680
I would have went with the Devil May Cry story, but that's all right.

1180
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:49,400
I mean, like I said, when I heard the aftermath about it, I was stunned.

1181
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:56,680
I was like, wow, but it did kind of show that y'all had enough clout to get that much attention.

1182
01:04:56,680 --> 01:04:59,520
All right, well, there you have it.

1183
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:01,520
Loki, Dark Soccer, do you agree?

1184
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:03,080
Was that the biggest story in March?

1185
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:07,220
Were we the biggest story in March, or are we just being egotistical here?

1186
01:05:07,220 --> 01:05:09,400
I agree actually with the Devil May Cry thing.

1187
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:11,520
You think Devil May Cry was a weird story?

1188
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:13,520
I don't know about Devil May Cry 4.

1189
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:18,960
I'm like, yeah, Devil May Cry 4 is on 360 and PS3, oh, good for them.

1190
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:26,680
I think that it's more or less the total public recognition by another company that, well,

1191
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:29,780
maybe the PlayStation 3 is a piece of shit.

1192
01:05:29,780 --> 01:05:30,780
That's what it was for me, too.

1193
01:05:30,780 --> 01:05:33,360
I would have worded that strongly, but yes.

1194
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:36,760
We want people to actually buy our game, so we're going to put it on a system that people

1195
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:37,760
are buying.

1196
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:40,960
I think that's what it was for me, is that that's the way I would phrase it, is that

1197
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:44,280
it was really a company kind of acknowledging, hmm, Sony ain't selling the way we thought

1198
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:45,280
it would.

1199
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:47,040
We're going to have to go put this game out on Microsoft as well.

1200
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:52,520
Or they figured out, hey, guess what, it isn't that hard to develop for the 360 and the PlayStation

1201
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:53,880
3 at the same time.

1202
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:55,360
Pretty easy to port the code over.

1203
01:05:55,360 --> 01:05:56,360
Let's do that.

1204
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:57,360
Exactly.

1205
01:05:57,360 --> 01:05:58,360
All right.

1206
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:02,880
I went through a bonus one and said basically, um, Stranglehold having so much expectation

1207
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:04,280
it ended up being a bust.

1208
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:07,960
Oh, that's right, Stranglehold was released in March, huh, I remember that.

1209
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:08,960
No wonder.

1210
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:09,960
Was it?

1211
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:10,960
Was it?

1212
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:11,960
Was it March or later?

1213
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:12,960
I think it was in the Sunday release.

1214
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:13,960
That was in like September and October.

1215
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:14,960
Was it?

1216
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:15,960
Yeah.

1217
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:16,960
But it seemed like this game, like it was at E3.

1218
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:19,400
Like a year and a half ago.

1219
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:20,400
And then, all right.

1220
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:26,080
It was supposed to be like a release title for the 360 at one point the way they showed

1221
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:27,080
it.

1222
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:30,960
I probably was originally supposed to come out in March and got delayed that whole time.

1223
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:31,960
That might be true, but.

1224
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:32,960
All right.

1225
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:33,960
Well, anyway.

1226
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:34,960
Let's talk about April.

1227
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:40,040
Episode 226 kicked off April and one of the top stories from that episode was the announcement

1228
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:44,400
that Sonic and Mario were going to be teaming up for a new game, Mario and Sonic at the

1229
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:45,560
Olympics.

1230
01:06:45,560 --> 01:06:46,560
And nobody cared.

1231
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:47,560
Dared.

1232
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:48,560
Well, hold on.

1233
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:49,560
Exactly.

1234
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:53,120
Now they don't because after the game came out, I don't think most people cared anymore,

1235
01:06:53,120 --> 01:06:56,280
but the week this was announced, this was huge news.

1236
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:59,560
That's kind of why I bring this up because people were like, OMG, Sonic and Mario.

1237
01:06:59,560 --> 01:07:03,060
But now, you know, obviously since then, we've had Sonic be announced in Brawl and all that

1238
01:07:03,060 --> 01:07:04,120
stuff too.

1239
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:08,540
You know, it's not such a big deal, but at the time, it was like, OMG, my childhood,

1240
01:07:08,540 --> 01:07:13,280
you know, fantasies in some way or, you know, the thing you never thought would happen is

1241
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:14,280
happening.

1242
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:15,280
Sonic and Mario in the same game.

1243
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:16,280
True.

1244
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:17,920
That was a big announcement.

1245
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:21,240
Episode number 227 in April, that was the week that Rock Band was announced and that

1246
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:24,000
was probably our biggest story we talked about that week because obviously Rock Band was

1247
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:30,000
a very ambitious game that ended up on many people's game of the year list for 2007.

1248
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,000
Will it end up on ours?

1249
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,000
We'll see.

1250
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:37,160
But yeah, Rock Band was announced that week and, you know, I think to an extent, I think

1251
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:18,460
the reason why this was noteworthy is that for us, especially here at Orange

1252
01:07:18,460 --> 01:07:34,720
that was a big announcement.

1253
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:36,880
And that was probably our biggest story we talked about that week because obviously Rock

1254
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:40,720
Band was a very ambitious game that ended up on many people's game of the year list

1255
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:42,520
for 2007.

1256
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:46,360
a lot of us were caught off guard at just how ambitious this game was because

1257
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:48,800
I think for a lot of us I don't know about you guys but for me I was like

1258
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:53,600
they're gonna do guitar, drums, and singing like all in one game that's it

1259
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:57,520
was like it's kind of it was like a big thing because I I would think that

1260
01:07:57,520 --> 01:08:00,680
nobody would have never thought of something like this being conjoined

1261
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:06,400
together for one game other than like the drum mania guitar freaks thing right

1262
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:08,940
and I think that's what it was for me is that you know obviously had guitar

1263
01:08:08,940 --> 01:08:12,440
freaks drum mania keyboard mania in the arcades years ago it just kind of

1264
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:16,320
surprised me that it was like whoa somebody's actually gonna try and do

1265
01:08:16,320 --> 01:08:19,360
this in the US and they are gonna put it all in one game and they're gonna put it

1266
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:23,800
all in one box and see if it sells that's that is fucking ambitious right

1267
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:30,080
there. And the ultimate kicker was they had a singing part to it

1268
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:34,560
and that was the ultimate kicker the ultimate breakdown was that you put

1269
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:39,480
singing into it it was like a big it was like a big deal especially with the

1270
01:08:39,480 --> 01:08:46,360
populated karaoke games. All right. Hey, Loki, say hey. episode number 228 a story that

1271
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:50,680
definitely stuck out for us in episode 228 a woman who played on the game World

1272
01:08:50,680 --> 01:08:56,960
of Warcraft posted an ad on Craigslist offering sex to get the gold to buy her

1273
01:08:56,960 --> 01:09:01,800
epic mount that's right it was the woman who will make an epic mount for an epic

1274
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:06,120
mount that's right she was the woman who would mount for a mount and obviously

1275
01:09:06,120 --> 01:09:09,240
enough said here I mean this got people talking about you know where do you draw

1276
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:13,320
the freaking line seriously I mean this this had a lot of people talking about I

1277
01:09:13,320 --> 01:09:18,120
would I would be curious what that woman's up to now like you know did she

1278
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:22,040
do it again? I got one to top of that actually I think I've never talked about it how

1279
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:26,720
about once I mean what probably has happened an Australian lady met a young

1280
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:32,640
teenager online through W.I.L.B. paid her way to come to America to visit him

1281
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:36,120
I remember I do remember hearing about this I think we might have covered this

1282
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:40,320
on the show but yeah it's similar it's a similar story yeah in some ways just

1283
01:09:40,320 --> 01:09:44,760
crazy what some people get into on Wow but you know I gotta say as a World of

1284
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:48,440
Warcraft player those epic mounts really are a bitch to get I mean I almost am

1285
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:53,560
ready to put out to get one and that's why I don't touch that game not really

1286
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:57,800
though I'm just kidding all right and then episode 229 was the last episode we

1287
01:09:57,800 --> 01:10:01,560
taped in April it actually must have been a slow news week because the top

1288
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:05,160
story I pulled from that one is that the PlayStation I was officially announced

1289
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:08,760
but actually I think the reason why this is relevant is because obviously you

1290
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:14,280
know a lot of us are kind of wondering you know Sony showed this off at you

1291
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:19,120
know e3 and it disappeared for the longest time we never heard anything

1292
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:22,440
about the eye of judgment and suddenly out of nowhere bam here it is the

1293
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:25,280
PlayStation eyes coming out and I think this might have been the episode where

1294
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:28,560
Loki made the bet I don't remember it might have been over the summer it was

1295
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:32,280
later late all right but regardless the PlayStation I was officially announced

1296
01:10:32,280 --> 01:10:38,880
in episode 229 so I mean like it just it seemed like the news was pretty slow I

1297
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:43,840
think what I'm trying to remember when I debut because I think I did I think I

1298
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:49,720
was working on that when I was like guys not much gaming this week hey it

1299
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:52,800
happens sometimes when you do we show sometimes that's why we play games

1300
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:57,200
sometimes that was a match game week all right anyway Dark Knight I'm out of

1301
01:10:57,200 --> 01:11:00,840
those four stories Sonic and Mario team up rock band announced a woman in World

1302
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:04,080
of Warcraft puts out for her mount and the PlayStation I officially announced

1303
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:08,120
what do you think had the biggest impact in gaming from April uh I would probably

1304
01:11:08,120 --> 01:11:13,200
have to say at first I was thinking about the Mario and Sonic thing but to

1305
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:18,320
be honest I think the World of Warcraft ain't just me on the grounds of it

1306
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:24,800
involved it involves sex for legal prostitution yeah yeah basically she

1307
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:27,960
said right virtually you're picking it because it's a story that involves sex

1308
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:36,120
which is fine but it is it is kind of an instance of taking your games way way

1309
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:40,680
way too seriously right I mean like other than what happened later on in the

1310
01:11:40,680 --> 01:11:44,920
years that made it worse and brought everything back ahead again I think the

1311
01:11:44,920 --> 01:11:48,360
reason why that is important to gaming in general in 2007 because I think

1312
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:51,680
ninety nine point nine percent of people looked at that story and went I don't

1313
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:56,160
want that to be me ever like even the most hardcore gamers were like I do not

1314
01:11:56,160 --> 01:12:01,520
want that to be me ever a way to keep us in check all right but here's the

1315
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:05,880
kicker though yeah I hate to bring political politics into this but mm-hmm

1316
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:09,600
I don't know if y'all heard but apparently a presidential candidate done

1317
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:17,200
scheduled a parade and Wow it was recently this is recent or I think it's

1318
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:23,640
a recent Ron Paul riffing interesting Ron Paul was going to Ron Paul

1319
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:27,120
apparently he got some people or somebody might set it up I don't know

1320
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:33,480
apparently he got they're gonna do like a little campaigning parade on Wow I

1321
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:38,480
forgot what thinking from Iron Forge to some area and whatnot and I was like

1322
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:43,560
wow they definitely they definitely having the goal to go for this one I

1323
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:47,760
remember jokingly said um great if this pulls off they're gonna win the nerd

1324
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:54,160
vote Wow no I know it's gonna be a hell of a year honestly this is about as cool

1325
01:12:54,160 --> 01:13:07,600
as dr. evil in Austin Powers I'm hip I'm cool he's like look see I'm hippie cool

1326
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:15,240
I know what World of Warcraft is vote for me I mean that's pretty much it look

1327
01:13:15,240 --> 01:13:19,120
how easy you can piss the gamers off you know and there's a lot of gamers over 18

1328
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:22,860
who are voters you know somebody like you know Hillary Clinton you know she's

1329
01:13:22,860 --> 01:13:25,760
a big presidential candidate she's pissed a lot of people off with her

1330
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:29,360
stance and she kind of remember she backtracked like earlier in the year she

1331
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:32,440
was kind of more anti-video game and then she kind of came out and supported

1332
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:36,120
the ESRB a little later and said you know we've done a lot of work and that

1333
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:43,120
it uh it's very interesting and then when I was waiting for your vote well I

1334
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:46,360
can say is 2008 it's gonna be a hell of a year with the election going on and

1335
01:13:46,360 --> 01:13:50,560
everything dark knight let's let's hear it what do you think in your opinion was

1336
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:55,960
the worst game of 2007 I had to agree with Davis dolphin animals yards I

1337
01:13:55,960 --> 01:14:00,460
played it once and never touched it again or base that I basically gave it

1338
01:14:00,460 --> 01:14:05,000
the what the hell was I smoking when I played this game award there you go well

1339
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:10,980
in your opinion what was the hands-down above all best freaking game of 2007

1340
01:14:10,980 --> 01:14:18,000
guys so many games but I had to go with Call of Duty 4 because the game basically

1341
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:21,520
could the big game could basically be turned into a movie by itself you

1342
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:24,200
wouldn't need no actors that you wouldn't need no actors or anything like

1343
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:29,440
that just put the game in let it run its course it's the Oscar hit I think as I'd

1344
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:34,160
heard somebody describe Call of Duty 4 it's just fucking epic it is it's just

1345
01:14:34,160 --> 01:14:40,040
fucking epic talk to best best person that asked about that talk to Travis I

1346
01:14:40,040 --> 01:14:46,160
will I will he's a veteran he'll tell you which by the way Travis was here

1347
01:14:46,160 --> 01:14:50,640
last week when we weren't here and did it did a heck of a show I gotta say so

1348
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:54,800
check that out out there yeah check that out at under station live dot org it's

1349
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:58,680

1350
01:14:58,680 --> 01:15:03,280
Travis Donovan Donovan live that's right but it's unknown but I think is and I

1351
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:08,960
think he did put the episode under under sedation nice cuz like I said I was there

1352
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:14,560
trust me I was part of that shenanigans that episode so lots of fun good times

1365
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:08,360
we're going on hiatus for the new year so I can get inebriated at least and

1366
01:16:08,360 --> 01:16:14,000
but we'll be picking up next year I think the first weekend in January will

1367
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:17,600
be starting up again so I gotta pass a message along to footy monster I don't

1368
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:20,180
know if he's listening tonight or what but footy monster obviously one of the

1369
01:16:20,180 --> 01:16:23,280
other co-hosts on over on ultimate quest which is a fellow all games affiliate

1370
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:27,080
including us we broadcast on all games Monday nights and Tuesday mornings I

1371
01:16:27,080 --> 01:16:32,320
gotta say this there is a new addition to our co-host in the back and you can

1372
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:35,480
only see him on operator 11 when we're up in the feeds over for right now but

1373
01:16:35,480 --> 01:16:39,600
when it comes back up notice this we have a new penguin in the back it's a

1374
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:44,920
little blow-up penguin that penguin is actually from Argentina my by roommate

1375
01:16:44,920 --> 01:16:47,760
sister was just there in Argentina and brought me back this blow-up penguin

1376
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:50,840
that I guess was in some type of snowboard shop and his name is Guido the

1377
01:16:50,840 --> 01:16:53,680
penguin and she photographed him at all these beautiful places throughout

1378
01:16:53,680 --> 01:16:56,920
Argentina and gave me the little book for Christmas along with the blow-up

1379
01:16:56,920 --> 01:17:00,160
penguin I thought it was just such a creative gift it's awesome so that's

1380
01:17:00,160 --> 01:17:03,320
pretty cool I'm not sure to pass that message along I thought footy would get

1381
01:17:03,320 --> 01:17:07,120
a kick out of that because sometimes you know Argentina is a huge fucking country

1382
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:10,840
but it doesn't get mentioned enough usually and you know because because the

1383
01:17:10,840 --> 01:17:15,720
gaming scene just isn't it isn't what it is here there you know what I mean it's

1384
01:17:15,720 --> 01:17:19,440
not it is very different as very because he lets us know very much so on the

1385
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:23,640
show all right well enough about people who aren't here let's talk about the

1386
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:29,320
year in review and talk a little bit about did you kill the fly Loki thank

1387
01:17:29,320 --> 01:17:34,200
you no there's there has been two flies in here bugging the shit out of us all

1388
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:37,480
night long we're about ready to scream all right anyway sorry to rail a little

1389
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:43,360
bit let's talk about may may started off with episode number 230 PETA got pissed

1390
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:48,640
off and PETA not of course the type of PETA that you eat but PETA being the

1391
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:53,040
people for ethical treatment of animals they got pissed off here's why they got

1392
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:56,800
pissed off do you remember when Sony did their God of War promotion in Europe and

1393
01:17:56,800 --> 01:18:02,560
they actually killed a live goat yeah man muttons good for you oh my gosh and

1394
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:05,760
PETA of understandably was pissed off about that and the rest of us were

1395
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:10,000
wondering what the F were they thinking having the I don't know if I don't think

1396
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:13,360
they actually killed the goat live but they had the dead goat like everywhere

1397
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:19,520
and it was just kind of like what the crap are you people thinking yep it was

1398
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:23,040
pretty humorous it's like they were did he at least make mutton or stew out of

1399
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:25,560
it or anything he just had a dead carcass right there smelling of the

1400
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:30,720
place mm-hmm mm-hmm awesome Oh at footy monsters actually in Chad he just he

1401
01:18:30,720 --> 01:18:36,680
just said something about Guido that's funny anyway sorry I got distracted all

1402
01:18:36,680 --> 01:18:41,120
right episode number 231 hey you'd like this as a roleplay fan one of the

1403
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:45,400
stories that stuck out from episode 231 Final Fantasy 4 was announced that it

1404
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:49,600
was going to be remade for the DS and not just you know this is much different

1405
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:52,160
from what Squeenix had been doing with the past Final Fantasy games and

1406
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:56,480
releasing them but they were going to remake all of Final Fantasy 4 similar to

1407
01:18:56,480 --> 01:19:00,880
how they did with Final Fantasy 3 and now the game is out in Japan we're still

1408
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:06,360
waiting for it here in the u.s. but certainly I had people thinking you know

1409
01:19:06,360 --> 01:19:09,040
different ways about that what do you think about the Final Fantasy 4 remake

1410
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:14,160
on the DS well I'm all for the remakes when they switch to another console that

1411
01:19:14,160 --> 01:19:17,840
was not previously and they're just gonna you know print more money once it

1412
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:22,560
gets released over there but there's some news with the sequel but I won't go

1413
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:27,200
too much into that but it's a it's a win for Nintendo so why not I I you know and

1414
01:19:27,200 --> 01:19:31,560
I was I was very hesitant about this I was like oh god this is like my favorite

1415
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:35,440
Final Fantasy game I'm like one of a very few amount of people where Final

1416
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:38,720
Fantasy 4 really is like my favorite Final Fantasy game and that probably is

1417
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:42,400
mostly sentimental value go in there but it really is like my favorite one and

1418
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:46,680
I'm just like please please Square Enix do not fuck this up but then when I saw

1419
01:19:46,680 --> 01:19:49,560
the you know screen caps and the previews I'm like wow this actually

1420
01:19:49,560 --> 01:19:53,720
looks pretty awesome yep so the cane stragoon jump for the win yeah looking

1421
01:19:53,720 --> 01:19:58,600
for oh it's gonna be great episode 232 big week for PC gamers because that was

1422
01:19:58,600 --> 01:20:03,240
the week that Starcraft 2 was announced and Blizzard reviving one of their

1423
01:20:03,240 --> 01:20:06,120
franchises they've been a little bit dormant I mean obviously we had the

1424
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:09,800
rumors of Starcraft ghosts years ago and everybody kind of thought you know this

1425
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:12,600
had to come eventually and finally it arrived in May the announcement of

1426
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:20,240
Starcraft 2 episode 233 was the one we taped live at Fonami and that was the

1427
01:20:20,240 --> 01:20:26,200
week that the Super Smash Brothers brawl news really started to pour in and

1428
01:20:26,200 --> 01:20:29,640
namely this is the one that was revealed that they were gonna be having tons of

1429
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:33,640
returning musicians you basically had all these people that had contributed to

1430
01:20:33,640 --> 01:20:37,440
other Nintendo games we're gonna be creating songs for Super Smash Brothers

1431
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:41,520
and remaking your old classics and you know obviously you can hear a lot of it

1432
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:46,960
on the official Smash Brothers site and just a lot of good stuff I mean it do

1433
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:48,800
you think brawls gonna live up to the hype

1434
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:54,440
Xenocore that's a rough one cuz it is getting quite a lot of hype I mean it

1435
01:20:54,440 --> 01:20:59,200
just whenever I start seeing games advertise this much I just expect it to

1436
01:20:59,200 --> 01:21:03,360
fall short a certain degree just you know just from process of elimination

1437
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:06,420
over the years you know whenever again gets hyped up and always fall short one

1438
01:21:06,420 --> 01:21:10,360
or two spots so if it does I'm gonna be surprised but if it does not then all

1439
01:21:10,360 --> 01:21:14,720
better and you know especially if it is true what Loki said earlier you know and

1440
01:21:14,720 --> 01:21:18,040
it does turn to be true that the game gets delayed another month it's gonna

1441
01:21:18,040 --> 01:21:22,240
have to be that much better to make it worth all they're gonna yeah that's a

1442
01:21:22,240 --> 01:21:25,480
first-party game so it's not gonna get relate release when it's complete crap

1443
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:29,520
there's no way true true well okay out of those stories of PETA and the God of

1444
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:33,960
War go go Final Fantasy 4 remake Starcraft 2 announced and Super Smash

1445
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:37,200
Brothers revealed what do you think was the story that had the biggest impact in

1446
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:40,840
gaming or if you have something else you want to throw in there go for it no

1447
01:21:40,840 --> 01:21:45,600
mainly I'd go with the the story with the guard of war carcass just because it

1448
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:48,800
spills over to mainstream media when you see stuff like that and it brings

1449
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:53,600
attention to the gaming and world and not a good kind of attention yeah it's

1450
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:57,120
definitely bad attention I have to agree with you there that's probably what I

1451
01:21:57,120 --> 01:22:01,040
would pick to definitely would pick that one all right let's move on to June we

1452
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:03,880
only take three shows in June I don't know what happened I guess we were we

1453
01:22:03,880 --> 01:22:07,040
fell asleep or maybe another Disneyland trip happened in there I'm not sure is

1454
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:11,240
it was there all right well there were three shows taped in June episode 234

1455
01:22:11,240 --> 01:22:14,760
that was the week I love this that was the week that Ubisoft apologized for

1456
01:22:14,760 --> 01:22:18,880
making crappy Wii games do you remember that one that they said you know what

1457
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:24,480
maybe we shouldn't have done so many ports just just to have a game company

1458
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:28,560
even though I'm you know obviously this was an off comment that some executive

1459
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:32,480
said they got turned into this whole you know Oh Ubisoft is apologizing for their

1460
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:36,800
crappy games even the fact that they even remotely went there was definitely

1461
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:40,560
newsworthy I gotta say because they did make a lot of crappy Wii games in the

1462
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:46,840
beginning episode 235 that was the week that Sony finally after all that time

1463
01:22:46,840 --> 01:22:52,500
finally launched their semi-official blog three speak finally that was

1464
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:56,720
launched in June of 2007 and obviously Sony had been kind of trying to catch up

1465
01:22:56,720 --> 01:23:01,400
you might remember from the year before all I want for Xmas is a PSP calm and

1466
01:23:01,400 --> 01:23:06,880
remember that didn't go so well that time and so most people were saying you

1467
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:11,120
know what Sony really needs like a major Nelson you know Nintendo has their

1468
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:16,000
poster kids with Miyamoto and Reggie Fils-Aime you know Microsoft has you

1469
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:19,020
know major Nelson and Trixie and people that are out there in the community

1470
01:23:19,020 --> 01:23:26,440
Sony's got crazy crayon-eaten-ken if they hired me I bet you I could sell ps3

1471
01:23:26,440 --> 01:23:31,240
how would you sell a PlayStation 3 first of all I'd restore it to its original

1472
01:23:31,240 --> 01:23:35,960
format mm-hmm but I would have it with all of the goodie stuff and a 40 gig

1473
01:23:35,960 --> 01:23:39,800
hard drive mm-hmm it would not even have the option of having more yes but how

1474
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:44,120
would you sell it what would that commercial look like boobs just just

1475
01:23:44,120 --> 01:23:50,560
women jumping on trampolines is that what it would be no you can have graphics

1476
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:57,880
this realistic oh my god okay that is a brilliant idea for a commercial just all

1477
01:23:57,880 --> 01:24:02,760
the commercial is is 30 seconds of boobs on trampolines and then in the very last

1478
01:24:02,760 --> 01:24:08,840
second it says generated by PlayStation 3 this is all real baby should be working

1479
01:24:08,840 --> 01:24:20,200
for Spike TV or or have like a shoe like barbecue because nothing will sell a

1480
01:24:20,200 --> 01:24:26,240
game like boobs and barbecue Mac man says in chat room Jamie would just tape a

1481
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:30,640
ferret to every PlayStation 3 free ferret with every game and Dark Knight

1482
01:24:30,640 --> 01:24:35,120
wants to remember how did that crayon-eating bit even start Megsy that's

1483
01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:38,640
right one of the OMR lesbians started the crayon-eating thing that's right

1484
01:24:38,640 --> 01:24:42,200
captain Crayola starts at Suya says all right well anyhow out of those three

1485
01:24:42,200 --> 01:24:45,920
stories or if you have one of your own Xenocore Ubisoft apologizes Sony

1486
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:48,400
launches their own blood oh I'm sorry I didn't even read the third and third one

1487
01:24:48,400 --> 01:24:54,560
episode 236 was the week that manhunt 2 officially got the AO rating and of

1488
01:24:54,560 --> 01:25:00,280
course this just began weeks upon weeks of oh my gosh when will this news end

1489
01:25:00,280 --> 01:25:04,160
about manhunt 2 and of course you know it didn't happen the same week but you

1490
01:25:04,160 --> 01:25:09,760
know you subsequently was banned by the British board and so on and so on I mean

1491
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:13,200
enough said manhunt 2 got the AO rating and had to go back for repairs and

1492
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:16,800
that's why the game got delayed to Halloween side of those three stories

1493
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:20,680
Ubisoft apologizing Sony launching their official blog and manhunt 2 getting the

1494
01:25:20,680 --> 01:25:23,600
ratings in a core what do you think biggest impact it's got it's got to be

1495
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:27,560
the manhunt 2 story I mean that that went all across the globe on that one

1496
01:25:27,560 --> 01:25:31,280
hands down absolutely everything else kind of pales in comparison that might

1497
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:34,600
because that story just kind of like the lady who died from drinking the Wii and

1498
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:37,320
the pita stuff and all the other stuff most people have named so far she drank

1499
01:25:37,320 --> 01:25:44,200
the Wii she drank all the water for the Wii drink we for a week now that's a

1500
01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:51,680
contest I'd like to see who's willing to drink their we for a week it really is

1501
01:25:51,680 --> 01:25:58,240
although although although you can use P as a I don't I don't I always think I

1502
01:25:58,240 --> 01:26:02,000
think back to when I watch survivor years ago and there was a guy there was

1503
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:06,600
the guy going the the stingray just bit me I need someone to pee on it and so

1504
01:26:06,600 --> 01:26:10,200
this lady goes over squats on him and pees on it and sure enough disinfects it

1505
01:26:10,200 --> 01:26:15,360
but it's really better with your own pee because it breaks down the proteins in

1506
01:26:15,360 --> 01:26:18,920
the in the toxin it's just remember the guys there I need someone to pee on it

1507
01:26:18,920 --> 01:26:24,600
I mean tenderizer works too sorry anyhow well seen a court let's not topic

1508
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:29,400
talking about I'm such discussing potty humor and let's get to the good stuff

1509
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:32,880
and that would be in your opinions in a car what was the worst freaking game of

1510
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:41,720
2007 the worst game of 2007 mmm I mean it's too easy it's too easy of a target

1511
01:26:41,720 --> 01:26:44,920
I was trying to think of something else but it did nothing comes to mind yards

1512
01:26:44,920 --> 01:26:48,280
needs to go whoever developed it needs to have their names published so they

1513
01:26:48,280 --> 01:26:51,840
can't get another job in the aiming industry so simple as that three out of

1514
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:57,440
three of named Yaris is I have a stick and it's not Yaris ah I can't think of

1515
01:26:57,440 --> 01:27:01,600
another one out we gotta save everything I'm actually gonna tell you the last

1516
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:06,960
issue of Xbox magazine was listing Yaris as a piece of crap into the official

1517
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:11,240
Xbox magazine even how sad how nice all right well let's get to the good stuff

1518
01:27:11,240 --> 01:27:16,480
Xenocore in your opinion the best freaking game of 2007 okay I'll probably

1519
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:20,440
get more hate mail for that but it gives me more to read on the show but uh yeah

1520
01:27:20,440 --> 01:27:27,160
I got to say portals the best game of the year why I'm surprised that I I was

1521
01:27:27,160 --> 01:27:31,320
I was waiting to write persona 3 as an RPG player I would have thought that was

1522
01:27:31,320 --> 01:27:35,460
gonna be your pick but why portal because it's the most innovative title

1523
01:27:35,460 --> 01:27:40,000
period everybody else is doing something that's really been done before I mean as

1524
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:43,800
good as Super Mario Galaxy is ratcheting clank beat him to the market with it

1525
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:47,720
rather or not they've developed it already Bioshock was a big

1526
01:27:47,720 --> 01:27:50,960
disappointment for me it was good in the beginning but it sucked at the end and

1527
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:54,960
in hindsight it's like what what's all this stuff you know so I threw Bioshock

1528
01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:58,400
to the side and the others just didn't make a big of an impact this portal I

1529
01:27:58,400 --> 01:28:02,160
can still go back and play portal now well point gets to win you never know

1530
01:28:02,160 --> 01:28:05,580
Xenocore we're gonna be recapping our picks later in the show and I'll bet you

1531
01:28:05,580 --> 01:28:08,640
at least one of the three of us agrees with you that portal was the best game

1532
01:28:08,640 --> 01:28:13,520
in 2007 but we'll find out for sure you never know surprises there are many

1533
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:16,320
so we'll get to that a little later in the show but Xenocore thank you so much

1534
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:20,040
for joining us and we always have appreciated your calls throughout 2007

1535
01:28:20,040 --> 01:28:23,620
best of luck to you and the whole crew at the ultimate quest for 2008 all right

1536
01:28:23,620 --> 01:28:28,280
yeah no problem thanks a lot guys all right take care buddy bye bye

1537
01:28:28,280 --> 01:28:31,820
that was Xenocore ladies and gentlemen helping us recap May and June and so

1538
01:28:31,820 --> 01:28:35,560
we're halfway through the year I think it's about time we take ourselves a

1539
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:38,120
little bit of a break don't you guys think we have to take a break here

1540
01:28:38,120 --> 01:28:42,720
pretty soon sure but there's one more thing we need to take care of before we

1541
01:28:42,720 --> 01:28:45,640
go to break because we are getting to the end of part a and what happens at

1542
01:28:45,640 --> 01:28:53,560
the end of part a that's right it's time for Dark Sakura's classic game of the

1543
01:28:53,560 --> 01:28:58,280
week the chance for her to respect the elders actually I believe tonight is a

1544
01:28:58,280 --> 01:29:02,800
very special edition because if I'm not mistaken tonight is the classic game of

1545
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:08,960
the year I shot she's nodding yes it is the classic game of the year so you

1546
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:12,280
need to check this shit out because this is gonna be this is gonna be epic

1547
01:29:12,280 --> 01:29:15,480
whatever she picks tonight and let's hear it

1548
01:29:15,480 --> 01:29:21,000
Dark Sakura what is the classic game of the year the classic game of the year is

1549
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:27,000
one of the best games ever in the universe it's Parodius Da Shinwakara

1550
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:34,000
Owariye which translates to my nose is all stuffed up it translates to Parodius

1551
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:43,520
from Myth to Laughter and the version that I have for our music is the PC

1552
01:29:43,520 --> 01:29:50,080
engine release of it because honestly and I've played through the Super

1553
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:56,000
Famicom one it lags so badly it has bad liquor and slow down because it's a lot

1554
01:29:56,000 --> 01:30:02,520
of stuff to process via the the PC engine did it better but this is as you

1555
01:30:02,520 --> 01:30:07,600
can probably tell from the name Parodius is a parody of Gradius it actually is

1556
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:14,440
the second one in the series the first Parodius came out on the MSX system but

1557
01:30:14,440 --> 01:30:17,560
in this one you get to play you've actually got your different power-up

1558
01:30:17,560 --> 01:30:21,960
abilities based on what character you pick you can play the Vic Viper from

1559
01:30:21,960 --> 01:30:27,120
Gradius you can play an octopus you can play a Twinbee this is the one where you

1560
01:30:27,120 --> 01:30:31,760
fight the stripper you they're the Vegas showgirl whatever she is yeah oh my god I

1561
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:37,520
remember this one by going in between her legs now why did Parodius never come

1562
01:30:37,520 --> 01:30:42,160
out in the u.s. it came out in Europe but why never here were we just not I

1563
01:30:42,160 --> 01:30:48,280
mean showgirl thing we just want to get too far up their ass so basically I mean

1564
01:30:48,280 --> 01:30:51,320
and for those of you that may be kind of looking at Jamie right now going what

1565
01:30:51,320 --> 01:30:54,440
the heck why are you picking this type thing you really do have to imagine this

1566
01:30:54,440 --> 01:30:58,720
game is Gradius on crack yeah and what makes this game so freaking epic is just

1567
01:30:58,720 --> 01:31:04,120
the fact that that I think it was mostly ignored here in the u.s. Moai stage

1568
01:31:04,120 --> 01:31:08,480
because you know kami games have to have the Moai head in there absolutely but

1569
01:31:08,480 --> 01:31:13,120
the way that the the power-ups worked I thought it was cool the Vic Viper is the

1570
01:31:13,120 --> 01:31:19,160
old-school Gradius config the octopus is the salamander configuration Twinbee is

1571
01:31:19,160 --> 01:31:23,720
the Twinbee configuration even with the rocket with the the punching fists and

1572
01:31:23,720 --> 01:31:29,960
pants Haro is Gradius three I always would play as a Twinbee because I love

1573
01:31:29,960 --> 01:31:33,360
the rocket fist but it's also really cool and the one that we're watching is

1574
01:31:33,360 --> 01:31:36,080
actually the Vic Viper playing through because you get the option and double

1575
01:31:36,080 --> 01:31:40,160
it's just like gradius to when you play it that way and the thing that my

1576
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:42,960
favorite weapon in the whole thing maybe this is a reason why I didn't come out

1577
01:31:42,960 --> 01:31:46,480
because of the Eagle I noticed that the boss monster is being fought right now

1578
01:31:46,480 --> 01:31:52,360
is an American Eagle wearing a Yankee hat and little bow tie it just exploded

1579
01:31:52,360 --> 01:32:00,240
well um a little bit more is that you one of your power-ups in the game is a

1580
01:32:00,240 --> 01:32:05,000
bell and you keep shooting the bell and like if you shoot the if you get a blue

1581
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:08,960
bell it'll make your character grow big and anything it touches will be

1582
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:13,400
destroyed if you get a green one it's a big flare and destroys everything on the

1583
01:32:13,400 --> 01:32:19,680
screen including most bosses and that's actually how you beat the naked lady you

1584
01:32:19,680 --> 01:32:23,640
one of the people that you fight is this woman wearing a sheet and when you shoot

1585
01:32:23,640 --> 01:32:32,760
she goes angels at you bubbles in fact here's a here's a picture of her on the

1586
01:32:32,760 --> 01:32:38,920
wiki I'll link it in the chat room nice nice um but she's really freaking hard

1587
01:32:38,920 --> 01:32:41,320
to beat so you have to usually have to have the mega flare by there but they

1588
01:32:41,320 --> 01:32:45,600
always give you a bell right before that stage my favorite of those is the gray

1589
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:50,400
bell which shouts words like the whole phrase is like you know I think one of

1590
01:32:50,400 --> 01:32:54,280
them is the equivalent of like eat at Joe's and another one is equals NC

1591
01:32:54,280 --> 01:33:01,920
squared and now this is actually not my favorite in the parodius series my

1592
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:07,520
favorite is a GQO Shabari Parodius which you can play on Saturn and that's the

1593
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:12,200
one that has and for anyone who wants to know that means chatting pretty aside

1594
01:33:12,200 --> 01:33:17,960
for anyone who wants to know it has the miracle OOP of it has the penguins

1595
01:33:17,960 --> 01:33:22,160
Pantero and Hanako twin be and win be that your Viper and Lord British from

1596
01:33:22,160 --> 01:33:28,200
Gradius not to be confused with Richard Garriott yeah right okay and it has

1597
01:33:28,200 --> 01:33:36,320
some girls writing on a missile and now it has I assume quite soon which for

1598
01:33:36,320 --> 01:33:40,880
anyone who ever played um Yu-Gi-Oh there's cards for them there are these

1599
01:33:40,880 --> 01:33:46,720
little stickmen writing on paper airplanes but I just think that it's

1600
01:33:46,720 --> 01:33:52,040
pretty cool had so much stuff going on and the other one in the series was

1601
01:33:52,040 --> 01:33:59,240
there was sexy Parodius and Paro Wars and I also saw last night and I mean if

1602
01:33:59,240 --> 01:34:04,080
you can hear on the thing a lot of the levels we mix Gradius music to start or

1603
01:34:04,080 --> 01:34:13,760
salamander music and then play classical music like so um but uh last night I was

1604
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:17,800
looking at YouTube trying to find you know because we obviously play the the

1605
01:34:17,800 --> 01:34:26,140
sound off of YouTube that way but I found the Parodius pachinko machine

1606
01:34:26,140 --> 01:34:33,000
videos nice and one of the there's even like this little model show with the the

1607
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:39,000
bunny suit girls is girls in bunny outfits writing on missiles and then

1608
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:45,520
you the the the showgirl was one of them stomping through the city and it's it was

1609
01:34:45,520 --> 01:34:50,080
just really cool I was like so we at least still have the Parodius franchise

1610
01:34:50,080 --> 01:34:54,680
still alive I would like to see a new Parodius really bad all right or some

1611
01:34:54,680 --> 01:34:58,000
folks have chatter saying Parodius on virtual console especially with the fact

1612
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:01,000
that we do happy we do know they will put Japanese games that were once

1613
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:04,600
Japanese only they have been releasing over here like Mario Brothers 2 the

1614
01:35:04,600 --> 01:35:13,200
original I think everybody is you know smart enough to just get over it I know

1615
01:35:13,200 --> 01:35:17,800
really it's not a big deal the reason why I like I'm very pretty is that one

1616
01:35:17,800 --> 01:35:20,360
of the bad guys in it is actually supposed to be one of the girls from

1617
01:35:20,360 --> 01:35:26,120
Tokimeki Memorial the the long-term dating sim nice yeah well there it is

1618
01:35:26,120 --> 01:35:31,520
folks your classic game of the year Parodius da in this case on the PC

1619
01:35:31,520 --> 01:35:36,480
engine but you know it's it's out there for multiple systems so very good pick

1620
01:35:36,480 --> 01:35:40,600
Jamie this game always cracks me up every time I watch it because Parodius

1621
01:35:40,600 --> 01:35:43,520
is an awesome game and where was this game in the Parodius collection that's

1622
01:35:43,520 --> 01:35:47,360
what I would like to know I know right but I think there was like I think there

1623
01:35:47,360 --> 01:35:50,280
was another I actually want to say that all of them have been released on

1624
01:35:50,280 --> 01:35:56,240
