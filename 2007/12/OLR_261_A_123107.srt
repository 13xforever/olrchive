00:00:14,641 --> 00:00:25,872
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, December 30th, 2007, on this special edition of Orange Lounge Radio, we take a look back at the headlines and games of 2007 with our favorite people, all of our listeners.

2
00:00:32,008 --> 00:00:33,429
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, Jamie Summers Hi I have a sinus infection

3
00:01:00,948 --> 00:01:01,728
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry to hear it.

4
00:01:02,589 --> 00:01:04,929
[SPEAKER_06]: You were sick quite a bit this year, I'm sorry to hear.

5
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:07,990
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't like sick, sick not like when I had the plague.

6
00:01:08,431 --> 00:01:08,591
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

7
00:01:08,631 --> 00:01:10,731
[SPEAKER_01]: However, this is exactly how the plague started.

8
00:01:11,232 --> 00:01:11,612
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh no.

9
00:01:12,152 --> 00:01:15,333
[SPEAKER_01]: So I hopped right on it and I have drugs that make me happy.

10
00:01:15,773 --> 00:01:16,633
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I hope you feel better.

11
00:01:16,693 --> 00:01:17,374
[SPEAKER_06]: How was your week off?

12
00:01:18,434 --> 00:01:21,355
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, well, I did absolutely nothing.

13
00:01:22,355 --> 00:01:22,615
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good.

14
00:01:22,635 --> 00:01:27,017
[SPEAKER_01]: I sat on my ass and did absolutely nothing and it was beautiful.

15
00:01:27,437 --> 00:01:28,137
[SPEAKER_06]: Was Santa good to you?

16
00:01:28,877 --> 00:01:29,918
[SPEAKER_01]: Santa was decent.

17
00:01:30,158 --> 00:01:30,378
[SPEAKER_06]: Mm-hmm.

18
00:01:30,976 --> 00:01:38,080
[SPEAKER_01]: Santa brought me... Actually, Santa Dan gave me a game that I sort of blinked and went WTF over, but I think I'm going to play it.

19
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:39,340
[SPEAKER_06]: What's that?

20
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:39,881
[SPEAKER_06]: You care to share?

21
00:01:40,041 --> 00:01:41,301
[SPEAKER_01]: That was... What's it?

22
00:01:41,341 --> 00:01:42,142
[SPEAKER_01]: Flash Focus.

23
00:01:42,742 --> 00:01:43,783
[SPEAKER_06]: The vision training game.

24
00:01:43,823 --> 00:01:44,083
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

25
00:01:44,363 --> 00:01:48,365
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to play it because clearly I need my vision trained.

26
00:01:49,946 --> 00:01:50,986
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I hope it works for you.

27
00:01:51,387 --> 00:01:57,970
[SPEAKER_01]: And I started... And we... I gave him a... What did I give him?

28
00:01:59,111 --> 00:01:59,911
[SPEAKER_01]: I gave him Blade Runner.

29
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:07,838
[SPEAKER_06]: and I bought him Ratatouille on Blu-ray for use on the Playstation 3 because it's your Blu-ray player too, right?

30
00:02:08,538 --> 00:02:17,222
[SPEAKER_06]: very cool it's pretty we'll hear more about your game of the week in just a minute that's not a game well, I know, but we'll get the other games as well, right?

31
00:02:17,962 --> 00:02:26,106
[SPEAKER_06]: well, I gotta introduce he's sitting there waiting for me to say the one and only Techmaster Loki I'm not really waiting for you, but that's fine how you doing tonight, Loki?

32
00:02:26,266 --> 00:02:29,027
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm doing fine and how was your Christmas?

33
00:02:29,047 --> 00:02:29,687
[SPEAKER_06]: Was Santa good to you?

34
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:31,208
[SPEAKER_02]: I was good to me

35
00:02:31,869 --> 00:02:34,692
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because I built a new computer.

36
00:02:34,832 --> 00:02:37,074
[SPEAKER_06]: Oftentimes we buy ourselves the best gifts, right?

37
00:02:37,374 --> 00:02:37,815
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

38
00:02:38,556 --> 00:02:44,421
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I buy everything for myself, I don't normally get anything for everyone else because they figure I've already bought it.

39
00:02:45,142 --> 00:02:46,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is usually the case.

40
00:02:47,264 --> 00:02:49,746
[SPEAKER_02]: But, I don't know.

41
00:02:50,127 --> 00:02:50,347
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

42
00:02:51,246 --> 00:02:51,666
[SPEAKER_06]: TigerClaw

43
00:03:16,278 --> 00:03:22,201
[SPEAKER_06]: wants to know if Loki has heard that Black Wolf bought the Eye of Judgment.

44
00:03:22,401 --> 00:03:23,041
[SPEAKER_02]: Good for him.

45
00:03:23,121 --> 00:03:27,023
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one more towards one million, which will never, ever, ever happen.

46
00:03:28,643 --> 00:03:28,904
[SPEAKER_02]: Ever.

47
00:03:29,164 --> 00:03:34,906
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember, just to reiterate from two weeks ago, it has to sell a million copies.

48
00:03:36,272 --> 00:03:36,813
[SPEAKER_02]: Some day.

49
00:03:59,847 --> 00:04:01,487
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Bobby's doing his own year-end show tonight.

50
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:02,308
[SPEAKER_06]: It's probably still going.

51
00:04:02,328 --> 00:04:03,708
[SPEAKER_06]: That's probably where some of our listeners are.

52
00:04:03,748 --> 00:04:04,048
[SPEAKER_06]: Who knows?

53
00:04:04,608 --> 00:04:08,369
[SPEAKER_06]: But meanwhile, we actually are going to continue on doing the things we usually do.

54
00:04:08,429 --> 00:04:10,909
[SPEAKER_06]: We weren't here last week because of the holidays.

55
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:16,611
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, Merry Christmas, Kwanzaa, Hanukkah, Solstice, Ramadan, whatever the hell it is you celebrate.

56
00:04:16,671 --> 00:04:17,191
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope it was good.

57
00:04:17,231 --> 00:04:18,931
[SPEAKER_06]: Or nothing at all, if you're atheist, right?

58
00:04:19,651 --> 00:04:20,792
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope it was good, whatever you did.

59
00:04:20,812 --> 00:04:22,172
[SPEAKER_01]: Ramadan's not until, like, later in the year.

60
00:04:22,832 --> 00:04:23,892
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, what am I mixing it up with?

61
00:04:24,633 --> 00:04:24,893
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, well.

62
00:04:25,713 --> 00:04:26,013
[SPEAKER_06]: Who knows?

63
00:04:26,093 --> 00:04:26,393
[SPEAKER_06]: Who cares?

64
00:04:27,396 --> 00:04:28,076
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody cares.

65
00:04:28,376 --> 00:04:29,196
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe it's Festivus.

66
00:04:29,817 --> 00:04:31,057
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they're so similar.

67
00:04:31,357 --> 00:04:33,558
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just trying to be PC and not leave anybody out.

68
00:04:33,998 --> 00:04:34,658
[SPEAKER_06]: So there you have it.

69
00:04:34,678 --> 00:04:36,218
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever it is you celebrate, I hope it was good.

70
00:04:37,058 --> 00:04:39,519
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's talk about our gaming weeks, because we do talk about that.

71
00:04:39,799 --> 00:04:41,539
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess I should say our gaming two weeks.

72
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,260
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, how was your gaming two weeks?

73
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:47,281
[SPEAKER_01]: I got Orange Box, so I played some Portal.

74
00:04:47,901 --> 00:04:52,582
[SPEAKER_01]: I've decided that I really like Half-Life 2 Episode 2, which Dan beat last night.

75
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:56,223
[SPEAKER_01]: I played a lot of pinball.

76
00:04:57,583 --> 00:04:59,084
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

77
00:05:28,174 --> 00:05:29,294
[SPEAKER_01]: Which I have on my DS.

78
00:05:29,854 --> 00:05:30,295
[SPEAKER_06]: Very cool.

79
00:05:30,535 --> 00:05:34,616
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've really just been more, you know, doing more Portal.

80
00:05:35,776 --> 00:05:36,176
[SPEAKER_06]: Portal's fun.

81
00:05:36,196 --> 00:05:38,337
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't play very much of it because I get sick.

82
00:05:38,517 --> 00:05:41,077
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, and, and, and, Dan got me Rock Band.

83
00:05:42,017 --> 00:05:42,117
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh!

84
00:05:42,137 --> 00:05:44,098
[SPEAKER_01]: I said I was going to get it, and I did.

85
00:05:44,358 --> 00:05:44,798
[SPEAKER_06]: Very cool.

86
00:05:44,818 --> 00:05:46,058
[SPEAKER_01]: And our guitar broke the first day.

87
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:47,099
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't.

88
00:05:47,859 --> 00:05:50,660
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've been using the Guitar Hero guitars because we have two.

89
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:51,180
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.

90
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:56,021
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we actually have a whole bunch of them because Dan's friend, Will, his stuff lives at our house sometimes.

91
00:05:56,301 --> 00:05:56,541
[SPEAKER_06]: Gotcha.

92
00:05:56,561 --> 00:05:56,681
[SPEAKER_06]: Gotcha.

93
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,783
[SPEAKER_01]: and Dan got my Iron Lung just for me and I can't say that I like it.

94
00:06:00,803 --> 00:06:01,643
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to buy that.

95
00:06:03,024 --> 00:06:05,686
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wasn't in the same room listening to it but it sounded like a cover.

96
00:06:06,507 --> 00:06:07,287
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it's not the original?

97
00:06:07,307 --> 00:06:10,329
[SPEAKER_01]: But the music is all dead on.

98
00:06:10,429 --> 00:06:18,175
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of the covers just are like... Well, maybe they didn't want to get sued like the Guitar Heroes 80s people did.

99
00:06:18,275 --> 00:06:20,797
[SPEAKER_01]: And I sing Creep and I sing it the right way.

100
00:06:20,937 --> 00:06:21,137
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you?

101
00:06:21,157 --> 00:06:21,237
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

102
00:06:21,826 --> 00:06:22,466
[SPEAKER_01]: I need a case for Rock Band

103
00:06:50,712 --> 00:06:54,893
[SPEAKER_02]: Dark Knight in chat says, I would love to hear Jamie singing.

104
00:06:54,973 --> 00:06:57,634
[SPEAKER_06]: Any possibilities of YouTubes in the future?

105
00:07:20,152 --> 00:07:21,472
[SPEAKER_06]: Not on YouTube.

106
00:07:21,713 --> 00:07:25,434
[SPEAKER_01]: If my throat doesn't kill me and I'm drunk enough, maybe.

107
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:27,254
[SPEAKER_01]: There is hope, kids.

108
00:07:27,294 --> 00:07:32,096
[SPEAKER_01]: My whole problem is that every year I get a sinus infection without fail.

109
00:07:32,336 --> 00:07:33,156
[SPEAKER_01]: This we all know.

110
00:07:33,856 --> 00:07:35,757
[SPEAKER_01]: But I always am sick on New Year's Eve.

111
00:07:36,037 --> 00:07:43,759
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm telling you, man, we need to get that video from Eddie that has a rice princess doing sabotage.

112
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:46,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Way better than me doing even Timmy.

113
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,961
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hilarious.

114
00:07:50,012 --> 00:07:56,234
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, at any rate, I always get very, very drunk while I'm very, very sick, which is pretty stupid.

115
00:07:56,915 --> 00:08:02,277
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they make me sing Karaoke Revolution, and last year I tried to sing Snake Eater, and I had no voice.

116
00:08:04,978 --> 00:08:05,798
[SPEAKER_01]: I had no voice.

117
00:08:07,118 --> 00:08:08,439
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, Snake Eater!

118
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:10,700
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it sounded like.

119
00:08:12,173 --> 00:08:16,679
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft is in chat, and Actdeft is saying that we should go out on tour.

120
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:21,565
[SPEAKER_06]: He says the OLR World Tour, the Sensible World of Podcasting Tour, a.k.a.

121
00:08:21,605 --> 00:08:25,530
[SPEAKER_06]: the Fag Your Anger Tour, which is an inside joke from 2007, of course.

122
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:28,153
[SPEAKER_06]: I like that, the Sensible World of Podcasting Tour.

123
00:08:28,173 --> 00:08:28,674
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a good name.

124
00:08:29,195 --> 00:08:29,855
[SPEAKER_06]: That's very cool.

125
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:30,256
[SPEAKER_06]: That's very good.

126
00:08:30,296 --> 00:08:31,436
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's move on to Loki.

127
00:08:31,456 --> 00:08:32,457
[SPEAKER_06]: How was your gaming week, Loki?

128
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:38,681
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this week, or actually last week and the week before last, I took some time off to play games.

129
00:08:39,842 --> 00:08:41,003
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's see.

130
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:50,028
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't play as much as I thought I would because I ended up playing mostly Saints Bro because I'm trying to finish it months after it's come out.

131
00:08:50,108 --> 00:08:51,369
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, trying to finish it.

132
00:08:51,889 --> 00:08:52,450
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually...

133
00:08:53,516 --> 00:08:54,557
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

134
00:09:11,033 --> 00:09:13,333
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

135
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:40,893
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just weird.

136
00:09:41,574 --> 00:09:46,897
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I think if I replace the... They have the X-clamp on there that you can replace the heatsink.

137
00:09:47,678 --> 00:09:48,358
[SPEAKER_02]: It should fix it.

138
00:09:48,398 --> 00:09:53,841
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I hear something underneath the board that sounds like... I don't know, like a ball bearing rolling around.

139
00:09:53,861 --> 00:09:59,345
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's actually some of the solder stripped off the board and actually kind of clumped up into a little ball.

140
00:09:59,785 --> 00:10:02,207
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm guessing that some of the solder is probably...

141
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,123
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

142
00:10:25,373 --> 00:10:29,436
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I played a little bit of Final Fantasy XII Revenant Wings.

143
00:10:29,817 --> 00:10:30,818
[SPEAKER_02]: It's okay.

144
00:10:31,138 --> 00:10:31,578
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

145
00:10:31,718 --> 00:10:32,739
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little different.

146
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:37,383
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess the combat system is kind of similar to Final Fantasy XII a little bit.

147
00:10:37,964 --> 00:10:47,852
[SPEAKER_02]: But I guess because I didn't play XII, the impact of these characters and when they're like, oh, this person came, it's like, okay, who are you?

148
00:10:47,992 --> 00:10:48,953
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know who you are.

149
00:10:50,728 --> 00:10:55,071
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's okay for me, but probably I should have played 12 before I played the DS game.

150
00:10:55,091 --> 00:11:00,275
[SPEAKER_02]: But hey, that's their damn fault for releasing one game on the DS and one on the PS2.

151
00:11:01,556 --> 00:11:02,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, what else did I play?

152
00:11:03,417 --> 00:11:07,240
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually played quite a bit of No More Heroes.

153
00:11:07,421 --> 00:11:08,722
[SPEAKER_02]: That game is fucking awesome.

154
00:11:09,382 --> 00:11:10,383
[SPEAKER_02]: It seriously is awesome.

155
00:11:10,723 --> 00:11:16,267
[SPEAKER_02]: After reading a fact on GameFAQs that was actually in English, I kind of figured out how to actually play the game.

156
00:11:17,568 --> 00:11:17,989
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty cool.

157
00:11:18,049 --> 00:11:19,730
[SPEAKER_02]: I finished the first boss and

158
00:11:20,245 --> 00:11:20,746
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

159
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:49,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now I've run into the problem where I need a good program to read temperatures because every single program they have reads it differently and I want to know which one's correct.

160
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:51,287
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't fry something.

161
00:11:51,527 --> 00:11:54,328
[SPEAKER_02]: But my chip's overclocked from 2.6 GHz to 3.3 right now.

162
00:11:54,368 --> 00:11:55,469
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Crysis runs about 35-40 frames per second.

163
00:12:03,584 --> 00:12:29,758
[SPEAKER_02]: but I want it to run faster and I'm also getting another graphics card because I replaced my old GTS or my 8800 GTS with the new one that's faster the GTS 512 and then I'm getting a second one, the SLIM so hopefully Crysis will run I'm shooting for 50 frames per second or 60 I doubt that's going to happen but smoother the better

164
00:12:31,061 --> 00:12:32,843
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, quite a lengthy gaming week, Loki.

165
00:12:32,863 --> 00:12:33,884
[SPEAKER_06]: Jeez, you're busy.

166
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:36,527
[SPEAKER_06]: Mine kind of pales by comparison.

167
00:12:36,847 --> 00:12:43,094
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, since the family of mine doesn't do a whole lot for the holidays, William and I decided to take a last-minute getaway to Reno.

168
00:12:43,895 --> 00:12:48,657
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, you know, Reno, not to offend any of our listeners who might live in Reno, but it's kind of a poor man's Vegas.

169
00:12:49,117 --> 00:12:54,458
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, there's not a whole lot to do in Reno except, you know, go to the big three casinos.

170
00:12:54,478 --> 00:13:00,180
[SPEAKER_06]: But we did go to one of the casinos there, Harrah's, and just randomly we found ourselves in the arcade.

171
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:08,403
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'll tell you what, the Harrah's arcade was actually kind of cool because there was a lot of classic shit in there that we got to kind of take some time to look at, including...

172
00:13:09,643 --> 00:13:10,244
[SPEAKER_06]: DDR4thMix Solo Machine

173
00:13:28,486 --> 00:13:31,388
[SPEAKER_06]: and I haven't seen one of those in years.

174
00:13:31,849 --> 00:13:34,871
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, William's like, you gotta get up and dance, you gotta dance.

175
00:13:34,891 --> 00:13:36,232
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I haven't played DDR forever.

176
00:13:36,272 --> 00:13:37,413
[SPEAKER_02]: Harrah's Tahoe, you said?

177
00:13:37,793 --> 00:13:39,674
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that's Harrah's Reno, not Tahoe.

178
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:39,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Harrah's Reno.

179
00:13:40,114 --> 00:13:40,315
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

180
00:13:40,835 --> 00:13:43,397
[SPEAKER_02]: I played on that DDR 4th Plus machine.

181
00:13:43,677 --> 00:13:43,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

182
00:13:43,897 --> 00:13:44,738
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, the solo one.

183
00:13:44,838 --> 00:13:45,979
[SPEAKER_02]: I do remember that now, but...

184
00:13:46,846 --> 00:13:47,346
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's funny.

185
00:13:47,766 --> 00:13:48,386
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what's weird?

186
00:13:49,406 --> 00:13:53,387
[SPEAKER_06]: The casino is very odd because the arcade is way back there.

187
00:13:53,427 --> 00:13:58,028
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not like Circus Circus, which has a new pump-it-up machine right in the middle of everything.

188
00:13:58,348 --> 00:14:03,329
[SPEAKER_06]: But at Harrah's, you have to go all the way back, and it's back in a dark corner.

189
00:14:03,349 --> 00:14:03,729
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of sad.

190
00:14:03,749 --> 00:14:09,590
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm guessing the pump-it-up machine is probably right in the front of their arcade where the third Korean machine used to be for a while.

191
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:16,211
[SPEAKER_06]: And now GS68 is telling me that at the El Dorado, they have a fourth-plus solo machine, which I completely missed somehow.

192
00:14:16,963 --> 00:14:17,363
[SPEAKER_06]: That's alright.

193
00:14:17,383 --> 00:14:18,044
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I was doing?

194
00:14:18,104 --> 00:14:20,046
[SPEAKER_06]: I was gambling and losing a lot of money.

195
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:21,967
[SPEAKER_06]: That's okay.

196
00:14:22,087 --> 00:14:23,008
[SPEAKER_06]: I won jackpots.

197
00:14:23,188 --> 00:14:24,289
[SPEAKER_06]: I won a silver jackpot.

198
00:14:24,309 --> 00:14:24,449
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

199
00:14:24,689 --> 00:14:26,450
[SPEAKER_06]: Except it was on a penny machine, so I only won $35.

200
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:27,171
[SPEAKER_06]: That's alright.

201
00:14:27,211 --> 00:14:30,093
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to remember that Solo sucks anyways.

202
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:33,176
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a dated joke.

203
00:14:33,256 --> 00:14:35,838
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, a DDRUSA mix machine.

204
00:14:36,398 --> 00:14:36,678
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

205
00:14:36,858 --> 00:14:37,559
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, rad.

206
00:14:37,979 --> 00:14:38,580
[SPEAKER_02]: That takes me back.

207
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,741
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, that takes me back.

208
00:14:40,321 --> 00:14:40,741
[SPEAKER_06]: Good times.

209
00:14:40,802 --> 00:14:41,342
[SPEAKER_02]: I love DDRUSA.

210
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:43,569
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, but here's the sad thing.

211
00:14:43,609 --> 00:14:44,670
[SPEAKER_06]: I had to play on trick.

212
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,051
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, remember when I used to be really good at DDR?

213
00:14:47,211 --> 00:14:49,553
[SPEAKER_06]: And you were good at DDR, and you were good at DDR.

214
00:14:50,174 --> 00:14:51,614
[SPEAKER_06]: You used to play doubles, Jamie.

215
00:14:52,655 --> 00:14:55,937
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to play doubles on like five feet.

216
00:14:56,518 --> 00:15:02,462
[SPEAKER_02]: I still play doubles and hope that death comes to me, but... Those were the days.

217
00:15:03,231 --> 00:15:28,714
[SPEAKER_06]: and then actually it's funny because some of my actually those of you guys that know Extifer Extifer's sister got married over the weekend and she married somebody who used to work at Konami's QA department with Shane so I saw a lot of people from my DDR days because he obviously invited all his old co-workers I saw some people from the old DDR days I hadn't seen him forever so it was really cool kind of a little bit of reunion so it was nice anyhow

218
00:15:29,232 --> 00:15:31,493
[SPEAKER_06]: Moving on, that has nothing to do with Game of the Week, that's just reminiscing.

219
00:15:32,133 --> 00:15:34,574
[SPEAKER_06]: As far as other games, I played some World of Warcraft, of course.

220
00:15:35,994 --> 00:15:50,519
[SPEAKER_06]: I now have, like, I think three PvP purples and some crafted rare epic stuff, so I'm definitely starting to exhaust everything there is to do at level 70, but I still have lots of instances to run and alts to level.

221
00:15:51,119 --> 00:15:52,780
[SPEAKER_06]: And also, I'll tell you what I've been playing.

222
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,321
[SPEAKER_06]: Santa brought me a copy of Super Mario Galaxy on the Wii.

223
00:15:57,572 --> 00:16:06,217
[SPEAKER_06]: Which I'd played before on our preview show, but it was nice to have some more time to play it without kind of that pressure of, you know, everything we're doing is being broadcast on the internet, right?

224
00:16:06,257 --> 00:16:08,178
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just kind of had time to take it slow, take it easy.

225
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:09,699
[SPEAKER_06]: I fucking love it.

226
00:16:09,939 --> 00:16:11,360
[SPEAKER_06]: It's... You know what?

227
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,981
[SPEAKER_06]: Like... And you know, I've said this on the show before.

228
00:16:14,021 --> 00:16:15,282
[SPEAKER_06]: Folks have been listening for a while.

229
00:16:15,602 --> 00:16:17,864
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought Mario 64 was a little bit overrated.

230
00:16:18,404 --> 00:16:22,286
[SPEAKER_06]: I did not think Mario 64 was the best Mario game of all time or any of that stuff.

231
00:16:22,746 --> 00:16:24,047
[SPEAKER_06]: I just didn't see it.

232
00:16:24,087 --> 00:16:25,488
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's a good game, yes.

233
00:16:25,608 --> 00:16:27,089
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, it's a great game, but it wasn't...

234
00:16:27,629 --> 00:16:30,692
[SPEAKER_06]: There was something about it I didn't quite like as much.

235
00:16:30,972 --> 00:16:33,934
[SPEAKER_06]: But Mario Galaxy, it really is all that.

236
00:16:34,014 --> 00:16:39,759
[SPEAKER_06]: I love some of the puzzles in it, like that gravity puzzle where you're inside the tube and the gravity's changing in a different way.

237
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:41,340
[SPEAKER_06]: It's cool.

238
00:16:41,961 --> 00:16:42,321
[SPEAKER_06]: I love it.

239
00:16:44,082 --> 00:16:49,907
[SPEAKER_06]: I definitely recommend if you're a Wii owner, you have to get Galaxy because this is the type of game that the Wii was really made for.

240
00:16:50,808 --> 00:16:52,449
[SPEAKER_06]: I've definitely been spending a lot of time on that.

241
00:16:52,589 --> 00:16:53,930
[SPEAKER_06]: And thank you, Santa, for bringing me that.

242
00:16:55,031 --> 00:16:56,973
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's pretty much going to do it for my Gaming Week.

243
00:16:57,665 --> 00:16:59,246
[SPEAKER_06]: How about you guys on the chat room?

244
00:16:59,266 --> 00:17:00,467
[SPEAKER_06]: How was your guys' gaming week?

245
00:17:01,147 --> 00:17:03,769
[SPEAKER_06]: I see a lot of people were naming Beatmania 2DX Distorted.

246
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:09,032
[SPEAKER_06]: Rock Band was played by Color of Sakura.

247
00:17:09,913 --> 00:17:11,454
[SPEAKER_06]: Legend of Zelda Phantom Hourglass.

248
00:17:13,775 --> 00:17:16,537
[SPEAKER_06]: Xene was playing Persona 3.

249
00:17:16,637 --> 00:17:20,540
[SPEAKER_06]: That's one of those games that came out this year that I totally missed.

250
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,680
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, what did you think?

251
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:23,141
[SPEAKER_02]: It's easy.

252
00:17:23,762 --> 00:17:25,383
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a fucking easy game.

253
00:17:25,863 --> 00:17:26,343
[SPEAKER_02]: That was it.

254
00:17:26,744 --> 00:17:27,144
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't

255
00:17:27,554 --> 00:17:32,861
[SPEAKER_02]: The last boss is kind of, I guess, a little bit more difficult than the rest of them, but it was really easy.

256
00:17:33,502 --> 00:17:37,347
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, I'm not that great at games, but come on.

257
00:17:37,407 --> 00:17:39,289
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, seriously, it wasn't a challenge at all.

258
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:46,375
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, let's get into some housekeeping and then we'll get into some of tonight's news and I'll tell you how the rest of the show is going to work too.

259
00:17:47,296 --> 00:17:49,158
[SPEAKER_06]: Our show is going to be a little bit different tonight.

260
00:17:49,858 --> 00:17:52,861
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to actually open up the Skype line a little early tonight.

261
00:17:53,562 --> 00:18:01,809
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, now that I'm noticing that a lot of our regulars aren't here, I'm hoping that we're going to get some calls on Skype line because we really want you guys to participate.

262
00:18:01,849 --> 00:18:04,011
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you guys don't call, we'll figure something else out.

263
00:18:04,311 --> 00:18:05,232
[SPEAKER_06]: But basically what we're going to do...

264
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:06,413
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

265
00:18:29,847 --> 00:18:30,227
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakuraLoki

266
00:18:48,683 --> 00:18:49,123
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

267
00:19:12,677 --> 00:19:13,498
[SPEAKER_06]: Jamey has one or two stories

268
00:19:30,197 --> 00:19:39,722
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, anyways, this week, some stuff that's probably not a big surprise happened, including Sony of America Trademarked Resistance 2.

269
00:19:40,102 --> 00:19:40,963
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, really?

270
00:19:41,023 --> 00:19:43,284
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to make a sequel to a game that sold a lot for them?

271
00:19:43,864 --> 00:19:45,925
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, that is such a shocker.

272
00:19:46,085 --> 00:19:47,386
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm so surprised.

273
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:49,347
[SPEAKER_02]: So surprised.

274
00:19:50,848 --> 00:19:53,489
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, Kira Yamaoka, one of our...

275
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:54,820
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

276
00:20:19,153 --> 00:20:23,634
[SPEAKER_02]: He was quoted actually saying that the U.S.

277
00:20:23,674 --> 00:20:27,395
[SPEAKER_02]: team's graphical and technical ability is amazing.

278
00:20:27,495 --> 00:20:32,376
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a huge gap, actually, and he's talking about between the U.S.

279
00:20:32,456 --> 00:20:37,417
[SPEAKER_02]: teams and Japanese development houses with the way games are going right now.

280
00:20:39,417 --> 00:20:39,717
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

281
00:20:39,737 --> 00:20:42,158
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that makes kind of sense, especially with, you know,

282
00:20:43,277 --> 00:20:48,343
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the companies being in the U.S., you know, Nintendo, I mean, they're both in Japan and the U.S.

283
00:20:48,383 --> 00:20:52,848
[SPEAKER_02]: and stuff, but I don't know, a lot of the third-party companies are in the U.S., so I guess that makes sense.

284
00:20:53,469 --> 00:20:55,571
[SPEAKER_02]: Not to say the Japanese can't program good games.

285
00:20:56,110 --> 00:21:15,354
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to go off on a tangent real fast, because this discussion was actually, I was talking to one of my friends in the car, we were up very late last night because we drove to Rocky Horror in San Francisco, and it was William, myself, and our mutual friend Jake, and Jake's a big gaming nerd like us, and we were talking about kind of Japanese versus American, I think actually I was talking about this very thing right here, because somehow we were talking about Silent Hill.

286
00:21:16,074 --> 00:21:21,618
[SPEAKER_06]: And it kind of occurred to me, you know, Nintendo's a very Japanese company, whereas Microsoft's a very American company.

287
00:21:22,118 --> 00:21:25,280
[SPEAKER_06]: And Microsoft seems to be kind of winning this.

288
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:31,104
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I mean, I guess I shouldn't say that because the Wii is obviously dominating, but the Xbox is kind of dominating in their own way.

289
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:36,087
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's kind of like, you know, the Xbox kind of caters to what's really big in the American market right now.

290
00:21:36,107 --> 00:21:37,348
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's Internet gaming.

291
00:21:37,848 --> 00:21:42,770
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's something that, for whatever reason, Nintendo has never seemed to capture.

292
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:45,991
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, you know, Nintendo is not getting on board with internet gaming.

293
00:21:46,271 --> 00:21:49,732
[SPEAKER_06]: They did one game on the GameCube that was a third-party game to begin with, right?

294
00:21:49,772 --> 00:21:51,493
[SPEAKER_06]: And they really haven't done much on the Wii yet.

295
00:21:51,773 --> 00:21:56,034
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, granted, we have Mario Kart, but we've all seen they can't... The friend codes thing sucks and all that.

296
00:21:56,054 --> 00:22:02,316
[SPEAKER_06]: And we were kind of wondering, like, why is it that Nintendo does not get online gaming?

297
00:22:02,356 --> 00:22:05,517
[SPEAKER_06]: And it kind of struck me, it's probably a cultural difference.

298
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:06,938
[SPEAKER_06]: And what it probably is...

299
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:20,789
[SPEAKER_06]: is that arcades are dead here in America, and that's why we're so big on internet gaming, whereas in Japan, it seems like arcades are still, I mean, maybe not what they once were, but they're still very prevalent, and people still meet up to do the gaming.

300
00:22:21,189 --> 00:22:21,649
[SPEAKER_02]: So what?

301
00:22:21,929 --> 00:22:30,275
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't understand that, because they recognize, though, that the US and Europe and stuff are big gaming markets, and maybe even bigger than Japan, and...

302
00:22:31,102 --> 00:22:31,703
[SPEAKER_02]: They recognize it.

303
00:22:31,743 --> 00:22:33,924
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we're getting so many we's here in the U.S.

304
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:35,886
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not like they don't understand that.

305
00:22:35,906 --> 00:22:37,447
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just they're just not doing it.

306
00:22:37,627 --> 00:22:44,131
[SPEAKER_06]: But kind of like why I'm relating it to this story is that when that's their culture, that's their perspective on things.

307
00:22:44,592 --> 00:22:55,339
[SPEAKER_06]: And so maybe I think part of the reason why like a cure of Yamaoka might be kind of really liking what the Americans are doing now is that because it's a different approach based on the way things work here.

308
00:22:55,859 --> 00:22:59,402
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you what it is, and this is pretty much – I mean –

309
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:00,900
[SPEAKER_02]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

310
00:23:22,677 --> 00:23:24,898
[SPEAKER_02]: and then, of course, it took off here.

311
00:23:25,138 --> 00:23:29,640
[SPEAKER_02]: Problem is, though, Nintendo didn't plan for any sort of online infrastructure.

312
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,821
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't think it was a big deal.

313
00:23:31,281 --> 00:23:34,662
[SPEAKER_02]: They said, whatever, our systems sell very well by themselves.

314
00:23:34,762 --> 00:23:35,803
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the portable systems.

315
00:23:36,043 --> 00:23:38,084
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we'll link it up with the DS and that kind of stuff.

316
00:23:38,564 --> 00:23:39,985
[SPEAKER_02]: And they didn't really do anything with it.

317
00:23:40,305 --> 00:23:42,446
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, come to find out, guess what?

318
00:23:42,566 --> 00:23:44,206
[SPEAKER_02]: Online gaming is really popular.

319
00:23:44,647 --> 00:23:46,988
[SPEAKER_02]: And now they're like, crap, what do we do now?

320
00:23:47,028 --> 00:23:49,709
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have any sort of infrastructure built for this stuff.

321
00:23:50,535 --> 00:23:52,056
[SPEAKER_02]: And so now they're way behind with all that.

322
00:23:52,096 --> 00:23:53,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Same with the PlayStation Network.

323
00:23:53,417 --> 00:23:56,198
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they didn't really have a unified online service or anything like that.

324
00:23:56,218 --> 00:23:59,641
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Sony's issue is that they are stretching themselves thin.

325
00:24:00,141 --> 00:24:04,624
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you notice when games keep getting delayed, like LittleBigPlanet Home keeps getting delayed.

326
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:08,926
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that to me says that Sony, their thing is that they've been trying to do both.

327
00:24:09,607 --> 00:24:18,532
[SPEAKER_06]: To Sony's credit, I think everything they've been doing, they are the ones that have truly been trying to appeal to a worldwide audience the whole time.

328
00:24:19,235 --> 00:24:20,436
[SPEAKER_06]: But they're stretching themselves too thin.

329
00:24:20,456 --> 00:24:20,976
[SPEAKER_06]: They can't do it.

330
00:24:21,036 --> 00:24:22,236
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't have the resources to do it.

331
00:24:22,756 --> 00:24:31,260
[SPEAKER_06]: Whereas Nintendo has focused their efforts on this, and Xbox, for the most part, has focused their efforts on this, and both have excelled very well, while Sony's spread themselves too thin.

332
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:34,621
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and the other thing, too, Microsoft now is starting to figure out, hey, guess what?

333
00:24:34,641 --> 00:24:46,566
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got to think about our Japanese market as well, and that's why they're publishing games like Lost Odyssey, Blue Dragon, stuff like that, to appeal to a more variety of consumer audiences.

334
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:48,274
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

335
00:25:13,943 --> 00:25:21,047
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though they're trying to break out of that mold and stuff, unfortunately, a lot of the games that they're still releasing, even look at first-party stuff.

336
00:25:21,067 --> 00:25:21,787
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, what?

337
00:25:21,847 --> 00:25:23,848
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got Metroid Prime 3.

338
00:25:23,908 --> 00:25:25,069
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that would be the only game.

339
00:25:25,149 --> 00:25:30,552
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe Excite Truck that's first-party that would kind of appeal to more than just kids.

340
00:25:31,833 --> 00:25:36,335
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of these games like Disaster Day of Crisis and Project Hammer, which is canceled.

341
00:25:36,755 --> 00:25:42,218
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, those games could have appealed to some older consumers, but they didn't do it.

342
00:25:42,859 --> 00:25:43,519
[SPEAKER_02]: Manhunt 2 Manhunt 2 Manhunt 2

343
00:26:05,492 --> 00:26:07,174
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

344
00:26:19,346 --> 00:26:19,546
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

345
00:26:19,566 --> 00:26:22,828
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I was going to turn to the chat room for some comments on this.

346
00:26:23,428 --> 00:26:27,070
[SPEAKER_06]: Some polarizing statements made by us on Viva Pinata.

347
00:26:27,111 --> 00:26:29,492
[SPEAKER_06]: Flaming Bozo says, Viva did not suck.

348
00:26:29,732 --> 00:26:31,093
[SPEAKER_06]: And Poeater says, Viva did suck.

349
00:26:31,573 --> 00:26:33,414
[SPEAKER_06]: So some polarizing opinions there.

350
00:26:33,934 --> 00:26:34,195
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

351
00:26:34,475 --> 00:26:35,335
[SPEAKER_01]: What did they try to do with Viva?

352
00:26:35,355 --> 00:26:36,336
[SPEAKER_01]: It went from suck to blow.

353
00:26:36,756 --> 00:26:37,937
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me put it this way.

354
00:26:38,057 --> 00:26:41,941
[SPEAKER_02]: Their expectations of Viva Pinata versus what actually happened were a little different.

355
00:26:41,961 --> 00:26:43,442
[SPEAKER_02]: They thought it was going to be the next Pokemon.

356
00:26:43,482 --> 00:26:44,243
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I agree.

357
00:26:44,303 --> 00:26:46,885
[SPEAKER_06]: They set their bar way too high on Viva Pinata.

358
00:26:47,666 --> 00:26:51,229
[SPEAKER_06]: I certainly would never put Viva Pinata on a bad games of the year list.

359
00:26:51,289 --> 00:26:53,792
[SPEAKER_02]: It just wasn't Pokemon.

360
00:26:53,832 --> 00:26:54,692
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a bad game.

361
00:26:54,913 --> 00:26:56,394
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a game I'm not going to play.

362
00:26:56,534 --> 00:26:59,056
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there are kids, I'm sure, that love the game.

363
00:26:59,377 --> 00:27:00,998
[SPEAKER_02]: There are probably adults that love the game.

364
00:27:01,138 --> 00:27:01,879
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just not for me.

365
00:27:02,219 --> 00:27:05,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Viva Pinata Party Animals, that's crap.

366
00:27:05,901 --> 00:27:10,343
[SPEAKER_06]: I think even like Major Nelson has said Viva Pinata Party Animals sucks.

367
00:27:10,383 --> 00:27:11,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me put it this way.

368
00:27:11,043 --> 00:27:14,525
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's pretty bad when the people inside Microsoft don't like the game.

369
00:27:14,565 --> 00:27:17,346
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole thing was they tried to like... I don't know that to be sure.

370
00:27:17,386 --> 00:27:17,847
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't quote me on that.

371
00:27:17,867 --> 00:27:20,928
[SPEAKER_02]: They tried to look at what Pokemon has and kind of emulate that.

372
00:27:20,988 --> 00:27:22,729
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're like, okay, it has a cartoon series.

373
00:27:22,789 --> 00:27:23,009
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

374
00:27:23,229 --> 00:27:24,310
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do a cartoon series.

375
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:25,230
[SPEAKER_02]: And it had a game.

376
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:26,090
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, let's do this.

377
00:27:26,371 --> 00:27:29,992
[SPEAKER_02]: Now if we put this out here exactly like Pokemon, it's going to have the appeal of Pokemon.

378
00:27:30,112 --> 00:27:30,793
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it did not.

379
00:27:31,053 --> 00:27:31,353
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact...

380
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:35,715
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought that adding the cartoon as well is kind of just shoving it down our throats even more.

381
00:27:36,215 --> 00:27:37,096
[SPEAKER_02]: Just leave it as a game.

382
00:27:37,136 --> 00:27:39,817
[SPEAKER_02]: If the game was popular enough to warrant a cartoon, great.

383
00:27:39,877 --> 00:27:40,237
[SPEAKER_02]: Do that.

384
00:27:40,738 --> 00:27:41,818
[SPEAKER_06]: I like Pooh Eater's idea.

385
00:27:41,918 --> 00:27:43,119
[SPEAKER_06]: Viva Manhunt Pinata.

386
00:27:43,959 --> 00:27:44,400
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

387
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:45,340
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

388
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:50,663
[SPEAKER_06]: I did not mean to derail the show with that little tangent, but when hasn't that happened before?

389
00:27:50,943 --> 00:27:51,863
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

390
00:27:52,144 --> 00:27:56,586
[SPEAKER_02]: Next week, SNK will be producing yet another new game.

391
00:27:56,686 --> 00:27:56,946
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wait.

392
00:27:57,006 --> 00:27:57,486
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm sorry.

393
00:27:57,506 --> 00:27:57,826
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not.

394
00:27:57,846 --> 00:28:00,708
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to be putting out Metal Slug 3 on Xbox Live Arcade.

395
00:28:03,089 --> 00:28:07,130
[SPEAKER_06]: And the sound of Jamie cheering, by the way, is the only person you'll hear cheering about.

396
00:28:07,431 --> 00:28:07,851
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

397
00:28:08,031 --> 00:28:08,531
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks cool.

398
00:28:08,551 --> 00:28:09,311
[SPEAKER_02]: Metal Slug has a cult fanbase.

399
00:28:09,331 --> 00:28:11,552
[SPEAKER_02]: It's supposed to have updated HD visuals.

400
00:28:11,792 --> 00:28:12,192
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.

401
00:28:12,272 --> 00:28:18,315
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever that's supposed to mean, because all the screenshots don't look updated to me, but... Okay, I'll take the word for it.

402
00:28:18,395 --> 00:28:18,715
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good.

403
00:28:18,935 --> 00:28:23,496
[SPEAKER_06]: Does HD visuals mean that they've added bars on the side that are pressed?

404
00:28:23,516 --> 00:28:23,917
[SPEAKER_01]: That's dumb.

405
00:28:23,937 --> 00:28:26,077
[SPEAKER_01]: They're gonna do like they did with Double Dragon.

406
00:28:26,437 --> 00:28:26,998
[SPEAKER_01]: Not Double Dragon.

407
00:28:27,018 --> 00:28:27,738
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Double Dragon.

408
00:28:28,542 --> 00:28:29,122
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

409
00:28:29,142 --> 00:28:29,722
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks okay.

410
00:28:29,842 --> 00:28:31,023
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, hey, you know what?

411
00:28:31,483 --> 00:28:34,404
[SPEAKER_02]: If SNK's listening, if you want to remake the game, great.

412
00:28:34,724 --> 00:28:44,646
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, like, reissue it, but, like, redo all the visuals, kind of like, I don't know, Super Street Fighter 2 HD, whatever, you know, that's going to be coming out.

413
00:28:44,666 --> 00:28:46,247
[SPEAKER_06]: Redo all the graphics, that'd be awesome.

414
00:28:46,307 --> 00:28:49,308
[SPEAKER_06]: Metal Slug might actually be a really fun live game.

415
00:28:49,528 --> 00:28:49,788
[SPEAKER_06]: It is.

416
00:28:49,808 --> 00:28:51,188
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, to play with people on live.

417
00:28:51,248 --> 00:28:54,129
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is going to have co-op over live, so that's kind of cool.

418
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:54,269
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.

419
00:28:54,980 --> 00:29:03,322
[SPEAKER_02]: and, um, so yeah, it's 800 Microsoft points, should be out Wednesday, no word on if there's going to be another game coming out as well, because it's only one game announced so far.

420
00:29:03,462 --> 00:29:11,605
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, and to Metal Slug's credit, although Loki and I give it a hard time on this show for kind of being the same thing over and over, it really is a lot of fun, I think this will be a good title for us.

421
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:12,525
[SPEAKER_02]: I just like the, you know,

422
00:29:13,632 --> 00:29:20,354
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to make fun of SNK because... They're still making 16-bit games all these years later.

423
00:29:20,374 --> 00:29:23,854
[SPEAKER_02]: The last four games that have come out from them have been anthologies.

424
00:29:24,895 --> 00:29:26,695
[SPEAKER_02]: No offense, I mean, hey, you know what?

425
00:29:26,955 --> 00:29:28,235
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not the only company that does that.

426
00:29:28,335 --> 00:29:29,636
[SPEAKER_02]: Capcom and Activision.

427
00:29:30,536 --> 00:29:31,196
[SPEAKER_02]: Or Midway.

428
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:35,537
[SPEAKER_06]: But some of the anthologies, like the Mega Man anthology, kicks ass.

429
00:29:35,797 --> 00:29:37,097
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

430
00:29:37,578 --> 00:29:38,918
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, you know, seriously...

431
00:29:39,984 --> 00:29:44,206
[SPEAKER_02]: Metal Slug 3, Metal Slug 1, they've been re-released so many times.

432
00:29:44,847 --> 00:29:49,069
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, okay, great, we love these games, but let's make something new, okay?

433
00:29:49,109 --> 00:30:07,920
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, so there's of course a new Street Fighter movie coming out, and I'm not sure whether you're going to be happy about that or not, but apparently one of the stars that they have casted so far is in the role of Chung-Li, and it's Smallville's Christine Kreek, and

434
00:30:08,604 --> 00:30:10,165
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, she doesn't look Asian to me.

435
00:30:10,886 --> 00:30:12,127
[SPEAKER_02]: But hey, she looks hot.

436
00:30:12,147 --> 00:30:13,988
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that the one that plays Lana?

437
00:30:15,669 --> 00:30:16,250
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe so.

438
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:17,430
[SPEAKER_01]: She's Asian.

439
00:30:18,511 --> 00:30:19,532
[SPEAKER_02]: She doesn't look Asian.

440
00:30:21,313 --> 00:30:23,635
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, that's not... I don't know.

441
00:30:24,255 --> 00:30:26,517
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever, it'll work, I think.

442
00:30:27,538 --> 00:30:28,198
[SPEAKER_06]: Is she hot?

443
00:30:28,538 --> 00:30:30,600
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's what most of the boys want to know.

444
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,260
[SPEAKER_06]: Is she hot?

445
00:30:31,661 --> 00:30:32,301
[SPEAKER_06]: And some of the girls.

446
00:30:32,661 --> 00:30:35,964
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, that's the most important thing, isn't it?

447
00:30:36,324 --> 00:30:37,665
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, ethnicity be damned.

448
00:30:38,214 --> 00:30:47,738
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, so I don't know if you really need to be honest, the last Street Fighter movie didn't set the bar too high, so I mean, you don't have to try that hard to make a good movie here.

449
00:30:47,938 --> 00:30:49,098
[SPEAKER_01]: But it had Kylie.

450
00:30:49,198 --> 00:30:51,839
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, Kylie Minogue was awesome as Cammy.

451
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:53,800
[SPEAKER_06]: And who was Chun-Li?

452
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,220
[SPEAKER_06]: Ming-Na was Chun-Li.

453
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,101
[SPEAKER_06]: She's on ER now.

454
00:30:56,221 --> 00:30:56,841
[SPEAKER_06]: She wasn't bad.

455
00:30:57,801 --> 00:30:58,282
[SPEAKER_06]: She wasn't bad.

456
00:30:59,882 --> 00:31:03,263
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, anyways, I've actually watched this little video here.

457
00:31:04,264 --> 00:31:04,724
[SPEAKER_02]: There isn't

458
00:31:05,558 --> 00:31:08,740
[SPEAKER_02]: A conference that went on, a hacking conference called 24C3.

459
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:20,749
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, I guess, an annual four-day conference organized by a hacking group called Chaos Computer Club, where, of course, thousands of hackers and scientists, artists, etc.

460
00:31:21,389 --> 00:31:21,729
[SPEAKER_02]: gather.

461
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:29,395
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the things that they showed off was that they have completely hacked the Wii.

462
00:31:29,755 --> 00:31:31,116
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an unmodded Wii.

463
00:31:31,396 --> 00:31:32,197
[SPEAKER_02]: They were managed to...

464
00:31:32,947 --> 00:31:35,608
[SPEAKER_02]: I shouldn't say it's unmodded, but there's no mod ship running in it.

465
00:31:35,789 --> 00:31:43,753
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've, using a specially made disc and a kind of a serial port thing, they called it, what was it, a tweezer attack.

466
00:31:44,934 --> 00:31:49,016
[SPEAKER_02]: They were able to run homebrew software in Wii mode.

467
00:31:49,136 --> 00:31:56,200
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually before that, they've only been able to do it through the GameCube operating system or whatever on there.

468
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,401
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all been limited to GameCube.

469
00:31:59,440 --> 00:31:59,720
[SPEAKER_02]: and so on.

470
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:31,202
[SPEAKER_02]: You can start and stop the drives and stuff like that.

471
00:32:31,602 --> 00:32:33,784
[SPEAKER_01]: That reminds me of something that I saw on YouTube.

472
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:35,686
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a feeling we're thinking of the same thing.

473
00:32:35,726 --> 00:32:36,006
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead.

474
00:32:36,046 --> 00:32:38,628
[SPEAKER_01]: The guy did the target placing.

475
00:32:38,991 --> 00:32:40,692
[SPEAKER_06]: That shit, that is the same thing I'm thinking of.

476
00:32:40,732 --> 00:32:41,832
[SPEAKER_06]: Wasn't that shit amazing?

477
00:32:42,112 --> 00:32:42,652
[SPEAKER_01]: That was pretty cool.

478
00:32:42,692 --> 00:32:44,253
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you see, okay, did you see that YouTube?

479
00:32:44,273 --> 00:32:51,636
[SPEAKER_06]: The guy, and I can't remember his name, I'm sorry, maybe somebody in chat remembers, but he was a student at some school and he put together this thing where I'll see if I can find it.

480
00:32:51,676 --> 00:32:59,979
[SPEAKER_06]: He swapped the Wiimote and the sensor bar to create this, you know, the television instead of

481
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:03,981
[SPEAKER_06]: Looking like a normal Wii game, it looked like a portal into another world.

482
00:33:04,001 --> 00:33:07,864
[SPEAKER_01]: He didn't use the sensor bar itself, he actually used two infrareds attached to goggles.

483
00:33:08,204 --> 00:33:11,086
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the sensor bar itself has an infrared reflect.

484
00:33:11,306 --> 00:33:12,247
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, and he put them in the glasses.

485
00:33:12,587 --> 00:33:16,429
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was basically, this YouTube is amazing, it's had over a million views, I'm sure most of you have seen it.

486
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:25,215
[SPEAKER_06]: But it was basically, he kind of called out a lot of the game developers in it and said, Hey, if you want to do something this cool, you should give me a call or you should do it.

487
00:33:25,475 --> 00:33:26,436
[SPEAKER_06]: I just told you how to do it.

488
00:33:27,562 --> 00:33:28,723
[SPEAKER_06]: It looked amazing.

489
00:33:28,783 --> 00:33:32,225
[SPEAKER_06]: Just even in the little YouTube, the way... Oh, wow.

490
00:33:32,645 --> 00:33:35,807
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, yeah, it was like a head tracking, a VR head tracking is what it is.

491
00:33:35,827 --> 00:33:39,469
[SPEAKER_02]: They have that right now for, like, flight sims.

492
00:33:39,489 --> 00:33:41,510
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, they're showing flight sim 10 or whatever.

493
00:33:43,251 --> 00:33:49,875
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do that, and you can actually do it where it will... That was not a hacking thing this guy did.

494
00:33:50,235 --> 00:33:56,359
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, he made his own custom program, but, you know, still, the hardware he used was all pretty much, you know,

495
00:33:56,963 --> 00:33:58,044
[SPEAKER_06]: Stuff that could easily be done.

496
00:33:58,464 --> 00:33:59,225
[SPEAKER_06]: It just looked amazing.

497
00:33:59,365 --> 00:34:05,971
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you can adjust, I guess, scale it so you don't have to look completely behind you to look behind you and stuff like that.

498
00:34:06,571 --> 00:34:08,193
[SPEAKER_02]: But, yeah, it's pretty cool.

499
00:34:08,833 --> 00:34:15,499
[SPEAKER_02]: And he had some other things, too, like on how to make a VR whiteboard type thing and some other stuff.

500
00:34:15,779 --> 00:34:16,059
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

501
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:22,445
[SPEAKER_02]: So, anyways, other things to note here.

502
00:34:24,363 --> 00:34:31,467
[SPEAKER_02]: Some that may not be too happy, unfortunately, and I hate to be the one to mention this, but I'm just going to say it.

503
00:34:32,207 --> 00:34:41,092
[SPEAKER_02]: This hasn't really been out there that much, or actually it hasn't been out there yet, this news, but I'll just say it, I guess.

504
00:34:41,973 --> 00:34:45,495
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a very likely situation that Smash Bros.

505
00:34:45,555 --> 00:34:46,776
[SPEAKER_02]: may have been delayed another month.

506
00:34:49,117 --> 00:34:50,438
[SPEAKER_06]: And where is this coming from?

507
00:34:51,365 --> 00:34:57,989
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I just happened to see a date change in our system for March now for Smash Bros.

508
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:00,150
[SPEAKER_06]: So it could just be an anomaly.

509
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:01,091
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be an anomaly.

510
00:35:01,111 --> 00:35:02,031
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be one of those things.

511
00:35:02,632 --> 00:35:04,793
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, here's why I think it might be true, though.

512
00:35:04,913 --> 00:35:06,734
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they're running into problems.

513
00:35:06,774 --> 00:35:12,077
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess there are so many, you know, places that they can manufacture Wii discs.

514
00:35:12,778 --> 00:35:19,101
[SPEAKER_02]: And right now they're at full production, and because of that, a lot of games are getting delayed because they can't manufacture this in time.

515
00:35:19,922 --> 00:35:20,002
[SPEAKER_02]: Um,

516
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:27,294
[SPEAKER_02]: and they've said a few months ago that all Wii games and some DS games will be affected by this.

517
00:35:28,014 --> 00:35:33,657
[SPEAKER_02]: And so being that the case, one of two things could be happening here.

518
00:35:33,917 --> 00:35:40,421
[SPEAKER_02]: One, distribution may not be getting their copies, but retail will be if there's going to be a shortage like that.

519
00:35:40,621 --> 00:35:46,544
[SPEAKER_02]: If they're anticipating that there's going to be a shortage, they're going to delay it for everybody else for a month, or it really is delayed a month.

520
00:35:47,445 --> 00:35:48,986
[SPEAKER_02]: So right now, just...

521
00:35:49,957 --> 00:35:55,098
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't be surprised if you see that news come out, but I wouldn't confirm it 100% yet.

522
00:35:55,799 --> 00:35:56,279
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

523
00:35:58,359 --> 00:35:58,699
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

524
00:35:58,919 --> 00:36:02,300
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, as some folks are hoping, could it be that they've delayed it to add Mega Man?

525
00:36:04,121 --> 00:36:05,721
[SPEAKER_06]: I somehow doubt that.

526
00:36:05,741 --> 00:36:09,762
[SPEAKER_06]: Didn't the guy who made Mega Man come out this week and say Mega Man is not in Smash Bros.

527
00:36:09,902 --> 00:36:10,362
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember.

528
00:36:10,422 --> 00:36:12,023
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm almost positive I read a story about that.

529
00:36:12,043 --> 00:36:16,444
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone thought that the 20th anniversary of Mega Man, they were going to announce that Mega Man was going to be in there.

530
00:36:16,821 --> 00:36:18,822
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

531
00:36:37,049 --> 00:36:39,671
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

532
00:37:04,713 --> 00:37:10,496
[SPEAKER_02]: Anytime that we've been delayed product or whatever, like say, oh, we're not going to ship you this much or whatever, they didn't change the street date.

533
00:37:10,516 --> 00:37:12,797
[SPEAKER_02]: They just, here's the date for this.

534
00:37:12,978 --> 00:37:15,539
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, by the way, you're not getting any until this time.

535
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:22,103
[SPEAKER_02]: I doubt they would change the date, but I'm just saying, you know, it's about a month.

536
00:37:22,143 --> 00:37:25,645
[SPEAKER_02]: I think March 9th is what we showed, but keep us posted.

537
00:37:25,845 --> 00:37:26,185
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

538
00:37:26,205 --> 00:37:26,685
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll keep you posted.

539
00:37:26,725 --> 00:37:27,986
[SPEAKER_02]: You heard it here first.

540
00:37:28,206 --> 00:37:29,347
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to mention one other thing.

541
00:37:29,427 --> 00:37:33,669
[SPEAKER_02]: There's two other games actually that

542
00:37:34,704 --> 00:37:36,024
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

543
00:37:55,720 --> 00:38:06,688
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to mention one other thing real quick Silent Hill Origins that was coming out on Playstation 2 in Japan it is coming out over here too

544
00:38:25,365 --> 00:38:27,126
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, sooner than later, March.

545
00:38:27,726 --> 00:38:28,007
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice!

546
00:38:29,147 --> 00:38:34,511
[SPEAKER_02]: Very excited about that, you know, because I didn't play too much of the PSP version, but PlayStation 2, that might be pretty cool.

547
00:38:35,491 --> 00:38:38,793
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though I guess I could plug in my PSP to my TV and do the same thing.

548
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:42,015
[SPEAKER_02]: Finally, let's see here.

549
00:38:42,816 --> 00:38:43,496
[SPEAKER_02]: What else we've got?

550
00:38:43,816 --> 00:38:44,757
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the DS.

551
00:38:46,042 --> 00:38:47,163
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been playing that already.

552
00:39:13,786 --> 00:39:14,566
[SPEAKER_06]: How's it going?

553
00:39:14,626 --> 00:39:16,167
[SPEAKER_06]: You do Christmas nights this time of year, right?

554
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:16,887
[SPEAKER_01]: I do Christmas nights.

555
00:39:16,947 --> 00:39:17,387
[SPEAKER_06]: Good times?

556
00:39:18,467 --> 00:39:19,708
[SPEAKER_01]: Very hard to watch on my TV.

557
00:39:20,968 --> 00:39:23,929
[SPEAKER_06]: Jamie, you got a story for us real quick, and then we're going to open up the Skype line.

558
00:39:24,189 --> 00:39:28,711
[SPEAKER_06]: So, 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype, is Orange Lounge Radio.

559
00:39:29,331 --> 00:39:31,131
[SPEAKER_06]: Call in and talk to us about the year 2007.

560
00:39:31,191 --> 00:39:42,035
[SPEAKER_01]: This is more of a humor thing, because I think it's pretty damn funny, is that Nokia's N-Gage first access platform has been delayed.

561
00:39:42,972 --> 00:39:43,312
[SPEAKER_01]: Dantum

562
00:40:10,646 --> 00:40:11,546
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, by this news.

563
00:40:11,706 --> 00:40:13,067
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever happened to the fucking Phantom?

564
00:40:13,427 --> 00:40:14,407
[SPEAKER_02]: The lap board came out.

565
00:40:15,047 --> 00:40:15,328
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

566
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:15,968
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

567
00:40:16,548 --> 00:40:18,449
[SPEAKER_06]: So it went from being console to lap board?

568
00:40:18,669 --> 00:40:18,849
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

569
00:40:19,509 --> 00:40:19,949
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

570
00:40:20,169 --> 00:40:22,610
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't think the console was going to work when they were showing it off.

571
00:40:23,370 --> 00:40:24,370
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it was just a PC.

572
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:25,371
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, I don't get this.

573
00:40:25,731 --> 00:40:27,411
[SPEAKER_02]: Who would download PC games?

574
00:40:27,792 --> 00:40:30,352
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently Steam worked, so I was wrong there.

575
00:40:30,452 --> 00:40:33,493
[SPEAKER_02]: But still, I mean, I don't know.

576
00:40:33,653 --> 00:40:36,594
[SPEAKER_02]: If they had a console that was just Steam, that might be pretty cool.

577
00:40:37,535 --> 00:40:37,795
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.

578
00:40:38,275 --> 00:40:38,535
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

579
00:40:39,249 --> 00:40:43,453
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, our Skype line is open, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

580
00:40:43,533 --> 00:40:45,495
[SPEAKER_06]: Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

581
00:40:45,535 --> 00:40:51,721
[SPEAKER_06]: Please remember, though, if you're going to call us on Skype, give our test call a call first.

582
00:40:51,741 --> 00:40:57,146
[SPEAKER_06]: That's Echo 123 on Skype, and that way you don't sound like shit when you get through on the Skype line.

583
00:40:57,606 --> 00:41:04,633
[SPEAKER_06]: And what we're going to do is we're going to recap some of the stories that we went over this year in the various months of the year.

584
00:41:05,595 --> 00:41:07,776
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'll explain how that works as soon as we take our first call.

585
00:41:07,836 --> 00:41:08,796
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

586
00:41:08,816 --> 00:41:09,196
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

587
00:41:09,876 --> 00:41:10,917
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Raven's Dolphin.

588
00:41:10,957 --> 00:41:11,537
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you hear me?

589
00:41:11,817 --> 00:41:12,877
[SPEAKER_06]: I can hear you, sir.

590
00:41:12,917 --> 00:41:13,397
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you?

591
00:41:14,398 --> 00:41:15,018
[SPEAKER_06]: I am fine.

592
00:41:15,058 --> 00:41:18,919
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, goddamn, if it wouldn't be a year in review show if we didn't have you here, Raven's Dolphin.

593
00:41:18,959 --> 00:41:20,219
[SPEAKER_06]: So I appreciate you calling in.

594
00:41:20,259 --> 00:41:20,820
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you doing?

595
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:22,420
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm doing fine.

596
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:24,661
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm playing Mario Galaxy just like you are.

597
00:41:24,941 --> 00:41:25,881
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't it fucking great?

598
00:41:27,182 --> 00:41:28,442
[SPEAKER_05]: I do think it's fucking great.

599
00:41:28,522 --> 00:41:29,062
[SPEAKER_05]: I really do.

600
00:41:29,602 --> 00:41:29,962
[SPEAKER_05]: Excellent.

601
00:41:30,443 --> 00:41:31,723
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, go ahead.

602
00:41:32,608 --> 00:41:35,530
[SPEAKER_05]: The thing about Mario Galaxy that impresses me is the graphics.

603
00:41:36,331 --> 00:41:42,917
[SPEAKER_05]: I know the Wii's a piece of shit, that's what some people say, but I really think that the Wii can pull off some really good graphics.

604
00:41:43,197 --> 00:41:48,381
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, and we've said it before on this show, Nintendo loves to have aces in their sleeves.

605
00:41:48,922 --> 00:41:56,468
[SPEAKER_06]: And their systems always have these little hidden features and are probably capable of much more than people usually give them credit for originally.

606
00:41:56,488 --> 00:41:58,049
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how they extend the life of their systems.

607
00:41:58,450 --> 00:42:01,092
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm sure you have not seen the best looking Wii game yet.

608
00:42:02,148 --> 00:42:04,109
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but this one is pretty good.

609
00:42:04,229 --> 00:42:10,032
[SPEAKER_05]: I really like what they did with the little effects, the little, like, twinkles, the little things.

610
00:42:10,052 --> 00:42:13,693
[SPEAKER_05]: You go in the air, you see little things here and there, you know?

611
00:42:13,753 --> 00:42:15,034
[SPEAKER_06]: The water shines.

612
00:42:15,154 --> 00:42:20,797
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, something to keep in mind, too, Raven's Dolphin, is that Mario Galaxy was not a ported GameCube game either.

613
00:42:21,117 --> 00:42:21,597
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?

614
00:42:21,737 --> 00:42:26,099
[SPEAKER_06]: It was truly an original game, and I think that's part of what made it stand out.

615
00:42:26,119 --> 00:42:26,840
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?

616
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:29,521
[SPEAKER_05]: But it is colorful, so that's all I'm going to say.

617
00:42:30,217 --> 00:42:34,679
[SPEAKER_06]: Raven, we're going to ask you to help us kind of recap the year here a little bit.

618
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:36,179
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to kind of go month by month.

619
00:42:36,219 --> 00:42:43,562
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to tell you about some of the top stories we went over, and I'd like to hear your thoughts on what you thought was really the standout story from that month.

620
00:42:43,642 --> 00:42:44,043
[SPEAKER_06]: Sound good?

621
00:42:45,183 --> 00:42:46,403
[SPEAKER_06]: I was waiting for this, yeah.

622
00:42:46,463 --> 00:42:48,924
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, then we'll get your best and worst game of the year at the end.

623
00:42:48,964 --> 00:42:54,387
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's take a trip all the way back to January, and January started off with Orange Ones Radio episode 215.

624
00:42:55,587 --> 00:42:57,067
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

625
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:19,041
[SPEAKER_06]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

626
00:43:47,761 --> 00:43:52,463
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a very tragic thing, and I remember that you didn't do a show that week when that story broke.

627
00:43:52,503 --> 00:43:52,803
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

628
00:43:52,843 --> 00:43:54,184
[SPEAKER_06]: We only did three shows in January.

629
00:43:54,204 --> 00:43:56,865
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember what happened, but we were off for a week in January.

630
00:43:56,885 --> 00:43:58,226
[SPEAKER_01]: I was at Disneyland.

631
00:43:58,606 --> 00:44:00,027
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, we both were at Disneyland.

632
00:44:00,047 --> 00:44:00,888
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what it was.

633
00:44:00,928 --> 00:44:03,309
[SPEAKER_06]: That was my first trip to Disneyland in a long time, so we were off.

634
00:44:03,369 --> 00:44:06,350
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was Martin Luther King weekend, and that's the weekend it all went down.

635
00:44:06,911 --> 00:44:07,231
[SPEAKER_06]: You're right.

636
00:44:07,271 --> 00:44:14,635
[SPEAKER_06]: We weren't on that week, and we came back, and we were just like, you know, if you think it's bad on the internet, try living here where it's all going down.

637
00:44:15,306 --> 00:44:17,931
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, you were doing your little guise on the show and you recapped it there.

638
00:44:19,152 --> 00:44:27,005
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that I was just whole surprised that, you know, no one had ever heard of, you know, drinking too much water.

639
00:44:27,849 --> 00:44:46,614
[SPEAKER_06]: and it was so funny because I remember especially in Sacramento, the area where we live, there's only been so many, there has not been, I don't have a number, there have not been that many water deaths in this country, but there have been multiple ones in the Sacramento region in the past couple years because there was the frat kid.

640
00:44:47,014 --> 00:44:48,135
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

641
00:45:03,613 --> 00:45:08,934
[SPEAKER_06]: Unlike I predicted earlier in the year, I believe when this story first launched, 107.9 is still the end.

642
00:45:08,974 --> 00:45:10,414
[SPEAKER_06]: It's still owned by the same people.

643
00:45:11,094 --> 00:45:13,075
[SPEAKER_06]: They have a new morning program in place now.

644
00:45:13,095 --> 00:45:18,216
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember what they're called, but they have other, you know, wacky morning DJs on there doing their thing.

645
00:45:20,036 --> 00:45:21,716
[SPEAKER_06]: Same old stick, but with different people.

646
00:45:22,876 --> 00:45:31,178
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think it was good that the ones that were in charge of that got fired, because honestly, I guess the majority of people in the world just don't know better.

647
00:45:32,218 --> 00:45:32,718
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's

648
00:45:33,707 --> 00:45:35,308
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

649
00:45:55,626 --> 00:45:58,787
[SPEAKER_06]: We had the Weather Channel was forthcoming in the News Channel.

650
00:45:58,807 --> 00:46:00,987
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the News Channel finally launched in January.

651
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:08,449
[SPEAKER_06]: And the reason why it's kind of noteworthy is because it was a game console doing something pretty major other than games.

652
00:46:09,049 --> 00:46:09,969
[SPEAKER_06]: It was the News Channel.

653
00:46:10,789 --> 00:46:13,370
[SPEAKER_02]: I have not watched the News Channel ever.

654
00:46:14,290 --> 00:46:14,530
[SPEAKER_06]: Ever?

655
00:46:14,650 --> 00:46:15,550
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't need to.

656
00:46:15,670 --> 00:46:17,250
[SPEAKER_06]: Does anybody actually use the News Channel?

657
00:46:17,651 --> 00:46:18,271
[SPEAKER_06]: How about chat?

658
00:46:18,331 --> 00:46:19,911
[SPEAKER_06]: Does anybody in chat use the News Channel?

659
00:46:21,175 --> 00:46:22,676
[SPEAKER_06]: Complete waste of time.

660
00:46:22,856 --> 00:46:24,176
[SPEAKER_06]: Should be able to remove that crap.

661
00:46:24,256 --> 00:46:25,397
[SPEAKER_06]: Raven, do you use the news channel?

662
00:46:26,037 --> 00:46:27,518
[SPEAKER_05]: I used it when it first came out.

663
00:46:27,538 --> 00:46:30,539
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you remember what the first headline when you went to technology was?

664
00:46:31,439 --> 00:46:31,799
[SPEAKER_06]: What's that?

665
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:32,700
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it was the...

666
00:46:34,022 --> 00:46:35,423
[SPEAKER_05]: Wasn't it the woman dying from the Wii?

667
00:46:35,603 --> 00:46:35,944
[SPEAKER_06]: Or what?

668
00:46:36,264 --> 00:46:39,046
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it was the PlayStation 3 launching in Europe.

669
00:46:39,426 --> 00:46:40,287
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember that.

670
00:46:40,327 --> 00:46:41,107
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

671
00:46:41,348 --> 00:46:42,328
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, you got a good memory.

672
00:46:42,388 --> 00:46:42,869
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

673
00:46:42,989 --> 00:46:49,614
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember I was amused because the first story I brought up in the technology was a story about the PlayStation 3 launching.

674
00:46:49,654 --> 00:46:51,595
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, I'm reading about the PlayStation 3 on my Wii.

675
00:46:51,635 --> 00:46:52,176
[SPEAKER_06]: This is weird.

676
00:46:54,117 --> 00:46:55,418
[SPEAKER_05]: Feels like an oxymoron, doesn't it?

677
00:46:56,222 --> 00:46:58,563
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft says my brother does use it daily.

678
00:46:59,663 --> 00:47:01,504
[SPEAKER_06]: Color of Sakura says I have used the channel.

679
00:47:01,864 --> 00:47:04,585
[SPEAKER_06]: Macman says I use the new channel to wipe my ass.

680
00:47:05,845 --> 00:47:07,726
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't use the channel at all.

681
00:47:08,106 --> 00:47:11,087
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I looked at it once and I went like, ah, don't need it.

682
00:47:11,947 --> 00:47:15,829
[SPEAKER_06]: I use it once in a while just kind of to spin the globe.

683
00:47:17,469 --> 00:47:21,331
[SPEAKER_06]: And check out, because like sometimes you really want to know what's going on and like, you know.

684
00:47:23,671 --> 00:47:25,392
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to spin the globe and make everyone dizzy.

685
00:47:25,412 --> 00:47:25,472
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay!

686
00:47:25,902 --> 00:47:28,003
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but everyone forgot about it long after.

687
00:47:28,043 --> 00:47:28,804
[SPEAKER_06]: It lingered like a bad smell.

688
00:47:28,824 --> 00:47:29,084
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously.

689
00:47:48,888 --> 00:47:49,788
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like some other ones.

690
00:47:49,948 --> 00:47:55,491
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, because it seemed like that story came up a couple other times, because then, like, you know, the family was going to sue Nintendo.

691
00:47:55,511 --> 00:47:56,571
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember that was a big follow-up story.

692
00:47:56,591 --> 00:47:57,432
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, because they're stupid.

693
00:47:57,492 --> 00:48:01,373
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's ridiculous, because Nintendo didn't have anything to do with it other than making the product.

694
00:48:02,374 --> 00:48:02,774
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, God.

695
00:48:02,814 --> 00:48:04,715
[SPEAKER_01]: Stupid people irritate the shit out of me.

696
00:48:04,835 --> 00:48:08,576
[SPEAKER_06]: But because they made the product, they engineered the desire for the product.

697
00:48:08,596 --> 00:48:11,457
[SPEAKER_06]: To be fair, they didn't actually sue Nintendo.

698
00:48:11,497 --> 00:48:12,978
[SPEAKER_06]: It was an exploratory thing.

699
00:48:13,018 --> 00:48:15,199
[SPEAKER_06]: They were thinking of doing it, and they decided not to.

700
00:48:15,219 --> 00:48:16,219
[SPEAKER_06]: So intelligence didn't prevail.

701
00:48:16,239 --> 00:48:17,420
[SPEAKER_01]: Even considering it stupid.

702
00:48:18,649 --> 00:48:19,689
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

703
00:48:36,394 --> 00:48:40,316
[SPEAKER_06]: A Games as Porn bill failed in the state of Utah.

704
00:48:40,997 --> 00:48:43,998
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, especially the games that are out now, I would not consider those porn.

705
00:48:44,879 --> 00:48:45,399
[SPEAKER_06]: Jeez.

706
00:48:45,719 --> 00:48:46,199
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, that's right.

707
00:48:46,279 --> 00:48:51,602
[SPEAKER_06]: Utah was going to, at one point, put some of the adult games, basically regulate it the same way they did porn.

708
00:48:52,623 --> 00:48:53,944
[SPEAKER_06]: But that bill failed in early January.

709
00:48:53,964 --> 00:48:56,125
[SPEAKER_05]: That makes absolutely no sense to this day.

710
00:48:56,425 --> 00:48:59,186
[SPEAKER_05]: I still think to myself, okay, Mario as Porn.

711
00:48:59,366 --> 00:49:00,807
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a great idea, Utah.

712
00:49:01,868 --> 00:49:04,129
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, Manhunt 2, though, is Manhunt 2 porn?

713
00:49:04,829 --> 00:49:04,969
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope.

714
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:05,830
[SPEAKER_06]: To them, it is.

715
00:49:06,428 --> 00:49:08,150
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

716
00:49:29,568 --> 00:49:29,888
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

717
00:49:30,189 --> 00:49:44,308
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, moving on through the month, episode 219, one of the stick-out stories from that episode, Codemasters had to replace faulty Bubble Bobble DS cartridges when the boss in level 30 didn't fucking show up.

718
00:49:46,394 --> 00:49:47,074
[SPEAKER_06]: You gotta love it.

719
00:50:03,702 --> 00:50:08,584
[SPEAKER_06]: and spilled the beans on some of the upcoming releases, including Jetpack and Tetris Online.

720
00:50:08,904 --> 00:50:17,366
[SPEAKER_06]: But what should also be noted is that this news came all the way back from February, and there were some other game titles that we never saw, like Juiced 2007 and Ob's Pinball.

721
00:50:17,766 --> 00:50:23,208
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, you know, a game like Ob's Pinball could have become the Pinball FX game that we did get.

722
00:50:23,268 --> 00:50:27,189
[SPEAKER_02]: Juiced 2007 is just Juiced 2 Hot Import Nights.

723
00:50:28,109 --> 00:50:30,450
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and it wasn't an actual arcade game or what have you?

724
00:50:30,470 --> 00:50:30,650
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no.

725
00:50:30,830 --> 00:50:32,591
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay, gotcha.

726
00:50:32,611 --> 00:50:32,791
[SPEAKER_06]: It was...

727
00:50:33,737 --> 00:50:34,178
[SPEAKER_06]: Those people suck.

728
00:50:49,153 --> 00:50:57,776
[SPEAKER_06]: Episode number 221, the last show we did in February, was the week that Warhawk was announced that it was only going to be a downloadable title on the PlayStation 3.

729
00:50:57,916 --> 00:50:59,376
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it was rumored.

730
00:50:59,416 --> 00:51:00,377
[SPEAKER_05]: Was it rumored?

731
00:51:00,417 --> 00:51:01,917
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it was confirmed for a while.

732
00:51:01,937 --> 00:51:08,659
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it was confirmed for a while, and then they came back and said, but we're also going to release it on Blu-ray with the headset and all this stuff.

733
00:51:09,139 --> 00:51:14,541
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was the week, though, that Warhawk was originally announced as a download-only title, which was big because...

734
00:51:15,365 --> 00:51:28,972
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, obviously this is one of the games that Sony was pushing and pushing when they first showed off the PlayStation 3, and for this to kind of go back and say, well, we're just going to make it a download-only game was kind of... Six-axis, all that stuff was going to be in it.

735
00:51:29,292 --> 00:51:40,458
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll never forget when they were showing off the six-axis, and he was trying to land the jet on the actual carrier thing, and it almost tipped it off the edge of the cliff because he didn't land it right.

736
00:51:41,001 --> 00:51:41,521
[SPEAKER_02]: That's hilarious.

737
00:51:41,541 --> 00:51:43,362
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'll remember of Warhawk.

738
00:51:43,863 --> 00:51:53,728
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so Raven, we have games as porn in Utah, Bubble Bobble, Broken, PartnerNet, Spills the Beans, and Warhawk download only on PlayStation 3.

739
00:51:53,768 --> 00:51:55,669
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think had the most impact from February?

740
00:51:55,729 --> 00:51:57,210
[SPEAKER_06]: The longest lasting impression on 2007 for gaming.

741
00:51:58,903 --> 00:52:02,346
[SPEAKER_05]: Or how about the fact that, did anybody test this game?

742
00:52:12,932 --> 00:52:14,693
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no testers in Codemasters.

743
00:52:14,753 --> 00:52:15,613
[SPEAKER_05]: That's hilarious.

744
00:52:16,093 --> 00:52:25,256
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently not, and it's kind of sad because I have a lot of friends who have been game testers that do very good jobs for various companies that they've worked for, and it was just kind of sad.

745
00:52:25,496 --> 00:52:38,721
[SPEAKER_06]: This kind of gave game testers everywhere a bad name that something like this slipped through the cracks, but obviously this was management cutting corners to meet some deadlines, and probably the game did not go through the extensive testing it should have, right?

746
00:52:38,741 --> 00:52:39,221
[SPEAKER_06]: It should have, right.

747
00:52:39,921 --> 00:52:45,223
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but to me, it just boggles the mind how the boss never showed up.

748
00:52:45,823 --> 00:52:47,603
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, how do you miss that?

749
00:52:48,264 --> 00:52:48,644
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

750
00:52:49,244 --> 00:52:50,084
[SPEAKER_06]: Good question.

751
00:52:50,204 --> 00:52:53,605
[SPEAKER_06]: Chatroom and Loki and DarkSakura, you guys agree with Raven's picks?

752
00:52:53,625 --> 00:52:57,707
[SPEAKER_06]: You think the Wii for a Wii and the Bubble Bobble were probably the biggest stories out of those months?

753
00:52:59,907 --> 00:53:00,267
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

754
00:53:00,467 --> 00:53:01,668
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I guess.

755
00:53:01,848 --> 00:53:02,048
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

756
00:53:02,771 --> 00:53:03,091
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

757
00:53:03,672 --> 00:53:20,467
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Raven, while we get the chatroom's impressions of your picks there, why don't you tell us what, in your opinion, and you can use any criteria you want, you don't have to listen to what the critics say or what anybody else says but yourself, what, in your opinion, was the worst game of 2007, the game that everybody should stay the hell away from?

758
00:53:21,247 --> 00:53:23,930
[SPEAKER_05]: Please, stay the hell away of this one game.

759
00:53:24,090 --> 00:53:27,593
[SPEAKER_05]: I swear to you, it's free, but it's not even more free.

760
00:53:28,334 --> 00:53:29,034
[SPEAKER_05]: Yaris for the 360.

761
00:53:30,168 --> 00:53:30,948
[SPEAKER_05]: Just stay away.

762
00:53:31,008 --> 00:53:34,109
[SPEAKER_06]: Toyota Yaris on the 360, the worst game of 2007.

763
00:53:34,569 --> 00:53:37,450
[SPEAKER_06]: Free and the robotic claw didn't do anything for you?

764
00:53:38,210 --> 00:53:38,970
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, my God.

765
00:53:39,150 --> 00:53:40,770
[SPEAKER_05]: I want my time back.

766
00:53:40,850 --> 00:53:41,630
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want my money.

767
00:53:41,650 --> 00:53:43,091
[SPEAKER_05]: I want my time back for that.

768
00:53:44,191 --> 00:53:47,152
[SPEAKER_06]: Best game of 2007 in your opinion, Raven?

769
00:53:47,692 --> 00:53:48,112
[SPEAKER_06]: Just one?

770
00:53:48,752 --> 00:53:49,352
[SPEAKER_06]: Just one.

771
00:53:50,032 --> 00:53:53,653
[SPEAKER_06]: You can tell us what some of your runner-ups would be, but we just want to know your number one game.

772
00:53:53,673 --> 00:53:54,753
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the only one we're writing down.

773
00:53:55,313 --> 00:53:55,693
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

774
00:53:55,713 --> 00:53:57,054
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess I'll go with Galaxy.

775
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:58,054
[SPEAKER_05]: I really enjoy that.

776
00:54:00,219 --> 00:54:00,960
[SPEAKER_05]: I really enjoy it.

777
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:08,464
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one of those games that just shows off the Wii and just puts everything in a nice package going, Nintendo did something.

778
00:54:09,125 --> 00:54:11,426
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything kind of close for you?

779
00:54:12,547 --> 00:54:15,489
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, there's a lot of things close, like Bioshock and Call of Duty 4.

780
00:54:15,569 --> 00:54:16,950
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't complain with those.

781
00:54:17,530 --> 00:54:19,552
[SPEAKER_05]: Overall, was it a good year for games, Raven's Dolphin?

782
00:54:20,152 --> 00:54:21,793
[SPEAKER_05]: Overall, it's a great year for games.

783
00:54:22,033 --> 00:54:23,934
[SPEAKER_05]: I compare it to 2004.

784
00:54:24,555 --> 00:54:25,295
[SPEAKER_06]: What was so hot about 2004?

785
00:54:25,335 --> 00:54:25,575
[SPEAKER_06]: Remind us.

786
00:54:27,355 --> 00:54:34,339
[SPEAKER_05]: We had Grand Theft Auto, San Andreas, we had Halo 2, we had Half-Life 2, we had God of War 1.

787
00:54:35,219 --> 00:54:36,600
[SPEAKER_05]: All those games came out in that year.

788
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:37,381
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

789
00:54:37,921 --> 00:54:40,682
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Raven Stolten, thanks so much for reflecting on the year with us.

790
00:54:40,722 --> 00:54:41,663
[SPEAKER_06]: We appreciate it, alright?

791
00:54:42,383 --> 00:54:43,704
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for having me on.

792
00:54:43,844 --> 00:54:44,945
[SPEAKER_06]: You are welcome, sir.

793
00:54:45,065 --> 00:54:45,905
[SPEAKER_06]: And best of luck in 2008.

794
00:54:45,965 --> 00:54:48,367
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll continue to hear from you in the year, right?

795
00:54:48,907 --> 00:54:49,307
[SPEAKER_06]: You bet.

796
00:54:49,427 --> 00:54:50,188
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, take care, buddy.

797
00:54:50,208 --> 00:54:50,268
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye.

798
00:54:51,510 --> 00:54:57,596
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to give us a call and help us out in March and April, give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

799
00:54:57,636 --> 00:55:02,861
[SPEAKER_06]: Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

800
00:55:03,281 --> 00:55:06,164
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to look at some of the comments in the chat room here.

801
00:55:06,224 --> 00:55:09,867
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkZombie says, I demand Yaris 2 for Xbox Live Arcade.

802
00:55:11,048 --> 00:55:13,371
[SPEAKER_06]: Shadowslayer says, Bubble Bobble is the best game ever.

803
00:55:13,431 --> 00:55:14,752
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm assuming he means the original.

804
00:55:16,272 --> 00:55:16,973
[SPEAKER_06]: Not the newer one.

805
00:55:17,473 --> 00:55:20,435
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go to the phones and see who's going to join us for the next part of the show.

806
00:55:20,495 --> 00:55:21,496
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

807
00:55:21,516 --> 00:55:21,896
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

808
00:55:23,438 --> 00:55:24,979
[SPEAKER_04]: This is DJ Dark Knight in the house.

809
00:55:25,539 --> 00:55:26,780
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, DJ Dark Knight.

810
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:27,761
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you doing, my friend?

811
00:55:28,721 --> 00:55:29,122
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm alright.

812
00:55:29,162 --> 00:55:30,362
[SPEAKER_06]: How about y'all guys?

813
00:55:30,703 --> 00:55:31,683
[SPEAKER_06]: I am excellent.

814
00:55:32,224 --> 00:55:36,167
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Dark Knight, are you ready to reflect on some of the previous months here in 2007?

815
00:55:36,207 --> 00:55:41,470
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I wanted to kind of follow up on that bubble ball thing, but it might be a little bit later on.

816
00:55:41,771 --> 00:55:42,151
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead, sir.

817
00:55:42,171 --> 00:55:42,631
[SPEAKER_04]: There was another...

818
00:55:46,303 --> 00:55:50,525
[SPEAKER_04]: Number DS game that had that same problem, and it was SNK vs. Capcom Carfighters.

819
00:55:50,645 --> 00:55:54,487
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the one card that wouldn't... Yeah, I remember that.

820
00:55:54,507 --> 00:55:57,268
[SPEAKER_01]: You couldn't get past the thing because the game would lock up or something.

821
00:55:57,288 --> 00:56:00,149
[SPEAKER_06]: Like a card didn't... Yeah, a card froze the game or something.

822
00:56:00,169 --> 00:56:00,650
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

823
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:04,832
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was interesting that that Bubble Bobble thing kind of started a trend, sadly.

824
00:56:05,192 --> 00:56:06,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

825
00:56:07,113 --> 00:56:09,994
[SPEAKER_04]: That one really hurt everybody for a while.

826
00:56:10,205 --> 00:56:10,906
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

827
00:56:23,542 --> 00:56:25,483
[SPEAKER_06]: This happened a little bit before.

828
00:56:25,603 --> 00:56:29,624
[SPEAKER_06]: The details were leaked before the Game Developers Conference.

829
00:56:29,704 --> 00:56:33,905
[SPEAKER_06]: But episode 222, the first week of March, was when we really started getting the details on PlayStation Home.

830
00:56:34,425 --> 00:56:39,226
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think the thing about PlayStation Home was it kind of made our collective jaws drop a little bit.

831
00:56:39,546 --> 00:56:45,087
[SPEAKER_06]: Because at this point, a lot of us had really written off the PlayStation 3 as the joke of this generation.

832
00:56:45,627 --> 00:56:49,968
[SPEAKER_06]: And then when PlayStation Home was announced, a lot of us kind of turned our heads and went, Really?

833
00:56:50,949 --> 00:56:51,349
[SPEAKER_06]: Really now?

834
00:56:51,389 --> 00:56:52,229
[SPEAKER_06]: This looks interesting.

835
00:56:52,779 --> 00:56:53,660
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it looks interesting.

836
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:54,760
[SPEAKER_06]: Wish it would come out now.

837
00:56:55,601 --> 00:56:55,861
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

838
00:56:56,101 --> 00:56:56,542
[SPEAKER_02]: Someday.

839
00:56:56,902 --> 00:57:01,645
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, now as we know, the damn thing still hasn't come out, but as I said before, I think Sony's spreading themselves too thin.

840
00:57:01,986 --> 00:57:07,049
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Home is still a great idea, and I can't wait to see it in 2008 or whenever it finally comes out.

841
00:57:07,850 --> 00:57:08,890
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

842
00:57:08,930 --> 00:57:13,173
[SPEAKER_06]: Dark Knight, do you think PlayStation Home is worthy of selling PlayStation 3s?

843
00:57:14,054 --> 00:57:14,474
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

844
00:57:14,514 --> 00:57:16,976
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's a good idea.

845
00:57:17,216 --> 00:57:18,017
[SPEAKER_04]: They try to...

846
00:57:19,179 --> 00:57:24,064
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it'll work.

847
00:57:24,104 --> 00:57:26,667
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it'll do much good.

848
00:57:27,628 --> 00:57:29,730
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see in 2008 when the thing finally comes out.

849
00:57:29,750 --> 00:57:41,962
[SPEAKER_02]: People like making their avatars and stuff, and to be honest, I wish Home was something that Nintendo was doing with the Miis, because I think that would've really launched that con- I mean, not that they really need any help selling the console, but

850
00:57:42,329 --> 00:57:43,830
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

851
00:58:11,369 --> 00:58:23,874
[SPEAKER_06]: and at the Game Developers Conference, I believe, Microsoft announced that they were going to be upping the arcade limit, which allowed some more titles to come out that were much bigger, such as Castlevania Symphony of the Night, I believe, was the first one that broke the 50 meg limit.

852
00:58:23,894 --> 00:58:25,254
[SPEAKER_06]: It was something like 90 megs.

853
00:58:26,095 --> 00:58:34,338
[SPEAKER_06]: And obviously the memory card sizes had to be upgraded as well, which I certainly don't think anybody sees this as a bad decision by Microsoft.

854
00:58:34,378 --> 00:58:35,898
[SPEAKER_06]: It was probably one they should have made a while ago.

855
00:58:36,699 --> 00:58:40,500
[SPEAKER_06]: Why they ever limited it in the first place was a little weird, but I guess it was because of the memory cards.

856
00:58:41,340 --> 00:58:45,644
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, because, I mean, and I don't think that many people actually bought them, like, talking about it.

857
00:58:45,664 --> 00:58:50,028
[SPEAKER_04]: I think most of the people bought the 512 one only because it came with Geometry Wars in it.

858
00:58:51,229 --> 00:58:52,290
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I guess that's a good point.

859
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:56,274
[SPEAKER_06]: Or, you know, you just, you have the core and the memory card's all you need.

860
00:58:56,354 --> 00:59:06,603
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, you know, I think most of the hardcore gamers like you and I and probably most of the people that, you know, seek out gaming podcasts and therefore listen to this program, we probably all understand why you need a hard drive.

861
00:59:07,253 --> 00:59:18,297
[SPEAKER_06]: But for those people that bought their Xbox 360s just so they could play Madden, you know, have it be their party machine, I suppose, you know, memory cards are what they're going to buy because that's what they're used to from PlayStation.

862
00:59:19,057 --> 00:59:19,877
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, right.

863
00:59:20,958 --> 00:59:28,380
[SPEAKER_04]: And plus, like I said, the last system, I remember the other system I had that had a hard drive in it was the Sega Saturn.

864
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:33,802
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was kind of like a take back when I saw that the 360, the newer systems would have that.

865
00:59:34,545 --> 00:59:35,906
[SPEAKER_06]: What about the old school Xbox though?

866
00:59:35,926 --> 00:59:38,428
[SPEAKER_06]: The first Xbox, they all had hard drives built in.

867
00:59:39,068 --> 00:59:39,689
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, that's right.

868
00:59:39,729 --> 00:59:41,029
[SPEAKER_04]: I forgot they did.

869
00:59:41,310 --> 00:59:42,711
[SPEAKER_04]: Xbox One had a hard drive.

870
00:59:43,531 --> 00:59:48,414
[SPEAKER_06]: Ironically enough, Xbox One didn't really use the hard drive though like it should have.

871
00:59:48,815 --> 00:59:58,201
[SPEAKER_06]: It almost seems like Microsoft when they originally conceptualized the original Xbox wanted to do some of the things from the very beginning that they didn't do until the Xbox 360.

872
00:59:58,321 --> 00:59:59,402
[SPEAKER_06]: It almost feels like that way.

873
01:00:00,211 --> 01:00:01,613
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, maybe it's just me.

874
01:00:01,653 --> 01:00:08,423
[SPEAKER_04]: I think most of the people use it just to record music, just use their music and play their CDs and whatnot and save it to the hard drive.

875
01:00:08,443 --> 01:00:09,925
[SPEAKER_06]: That's really all you could use it for.

876
01:00:10,706 --> 01:00:11,047
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

877
01:00:11,628 --> 01:00:11,788
[SPEAKER_06]: Well...

878
01:00:12,708 --> 01:00:13,008
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't fake.

879
01:00:13,028 --> 01:00:13,469
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't fake.

880
01:00:41,974 --> 01:00:48,456
[SPEAKER_06]: And the reason why I picked that is not necessarily the announcement itself, but all the fallout.

881
01:00:48,776 --> 01:01:04,662
[SPEAKER_06]: The backlash that came from that because it definitely kind of showed, you know, A, can the independent media be trusted and who are these guys and da-da-da, and kind of B, you know, when Namco, obviously, you know, as most people know, it's not a very big secret now.

882
01:01:04,702 --> 01:01:07,123
[SPEAKER_06]: Now that the game's out, I think we can talk a little more openly about this.

883
01:01:07,143 --> 01:01:07,263
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

884
01:01:07,583 --> 01:01:20,554
[SPEAKER_06]: Namco put the smacketh down a little bit and there wasn't a lot we could do because we are an independent organization because this is something that is run out of our spare times and because the fact these you know we don't have the

885
01:01:21,368 --> 01:01:23,009
[SPEAKER_06]: and many more.

886
01:01:45,925 --> 01:01:50,372
[SPEAKER_04]: They was up in arms about it and Sony was like, okay, okay, okay, we'll bend, we bend, we bend.

887
01:01:50,752 --> 01:01:51,173
[SPEAKER_04]: But it hurt.

888
01:01:51,213 --> 01:01:51,494
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just...

889
01:01:54,671 --> 01:01:56,492
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing's worse than a community scorn.

890
01:01:56,672 --> 01:02:01,976
[SPEAKER_06]: But unfortunately, we don't have that same oomph that Kotaku has.

891
01:02:02,036 --> 01:02:03,156
[SPEAKER_06]: It just kind of sucks.

892
01:02:03,256 --> 01:02:07,159
[SPEAKER_06]: But it definitely was a very interesting thing to watch.

893
01:02:07,199 --> 01:02:09,820
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure it was a hell of a thing to see from the inside.

894
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:13,843
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure on the outside it was probably pretty interesting too.

895
01:02:13,863 --> 01:02:16,044
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I said, I do my own show.

896
01:02:16,064 --> 01:02:18,146
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kind of sketchy on most of the release news.

897
01:02:18,226 --> 01:02:18,526
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like...

898
01:02:18,926 --> 01:02:19,406
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to jail.

899
01:02:19,426 --> 01:02:20,027
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to jail.

900
01:02:20,087 --> 01:02:22,148
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to jail.

901
01:02:45,743 --> 01:02:47,925
[SPEAKER_06]: Views and opinions expressed by Loki, please don't sue us.

902
01:02:49,627 --> 01:02:58,876
[SPEAKER_06]: Episode number 225, there was one more episode that came out in March, and that was the episode where Devil May Cry 4 was announced that it will no longer be a PlayStation 3 exclusive.

903
01:02:59,296 --> 01:03:02,880
[SPEAKER_06]: And obviously that had a big impact because that kind of left...

904
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:12,165
[SPEAKER_06]: Metal Gear Solid 4, and Final Fantasy XIII is the only real AAA, Super Grade A, PlayStation 3 exclusives left.

905
01:03:12,225 --> 01:03:14,987
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, this was huge the week that this one was announced.

906
01:03:15,307 --> 01:03:19,990
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it was like, oh my gosh, one of the big three just jumped ship, and it's now going to be Xbox 360.

907
01:03:20,390 --> 01:03:28,395
[SPEAKER_06]: And now, flashing forward to where we're at now, not only is it also coming out on the Xbox 360, but they're making bundles out of it in Japan.

908
01:03:28,675 --> 01:03:30,716
[SPEAKER_06]: The whole Devil May Cry bundles now are coming out.

909
01:03:31,397 --> 01:03:34,020
[SPEAKER_06]: Devil May Cry for 360 if he doesn't get one.

910
01:03:36,442 --> 01:03:37,263
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, don't get me wrong.

911
01:03:37,323 --> 01:03:38,645
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw a preview of the game in it.

912
01:03:39,165 --> 01:03:39,946
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to look good.

913
01:03:42,068 --> 01:03:43,170
[SPEAKER_06]: It does look pretty awesome.

914
01:03:43,210 --> 01:03:44,030
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to have to check it out.

915
01:03:44,050 --> 01:03:48,555
[SPEAKER_06]: I've never really followed the Devil May Cry series that closely, but this game may have to make me change my mind.

916
01:03:48,775 --> 01:03:50,778
[SPEAKER_01]: It has one thing going for it so far.

917
01:03:51,318 --> 01:03:52,319
[SPEAKER_01]: The return of Trish.

918
01:03:54,372 --> 01:03:55,133
[SPEAKER_01]: Jamie's happy.

919
01:03:55,733 --> 01:04:08,798
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well, Dark Knight, out of those four stories, the unveiling of PlayStation Home, Microsoft upping the arcade limit, beautiful Katamari being spoiled by us, and Devil May Cry 4 no longer being a PlayStation 3 exclusive, which one do you think had the most impact in 2007?

920
01:04:09,078 --> 01:04:14,920
[SPEAKER_04]: I said Katamari spoiler thing, because like I said, it was just basically...

921
01:04:16,325 --> 01:04:44,175
[SPEAKER_04]: I open it to everybody to let them know that yeah, this really not only can affect the big guys but it can affect the minor guys and leak a story like that and have somebody go no, you might want to and I know because of our announcement those sales of Katamari have been so horrible just because of our announcement you know what's weird I actually wouldn't have picked the same story myself I wouldn't have, I would have went with the Devil May Cry story but that's alright

922
01:04:44,778 --> 01:04:49,360
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, like I said, when I heard the aftermath about it, I was stunned.

923
01:04:49,460 --> 01:04:50,640
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, wow.

924
01:04:52,221 --> 01:04:56,302
[SPEAKER_04]: But it did kind of show that y'all had enough clout to get that much attention.

925
01:04:57,543 --> 01:04:57,863
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

926
01:04:58,263 --> 01:04:59,164
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there you have it.

927
01:04:59,864 --> 01:05:01,204
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, DarkSakura, do you agree?

928
01:05:01,484 --> 01:05:02,845
[SPEAKER_06]: Was that the biggest story in March?

929
01:05:03,025 --> 01:05:04,205
[SPEAKER_06]: Were we the biggest story in March?

930
01:05:04,245 --> 01:05:05,506
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we just being egotistical here?

931
01:05:07,423 --> 01:05:09,445
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree, actually, with the Devil May Cry thing.

932
01:05:09,865 --> 01:05:11,407
[SPEAKER_06]: You think Devil May Cry was a weird story?

933
01:05:11,567 --> 01:05:13,009
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care about Devil May Cry 4.

934
01:05:13,129 --> 01:05:17,114
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, yeah, Devil May Cry 4 is on 360 and PS3.

935
01:05:17,354 --> 01:05:18,035
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, good for them.

936
01:05:19,076 --> 01:05:25,964
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that it's more or less the total public recognition by another company that

937
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:29,281
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, maybe the PlayStation 3 is a piece of shit.

938
01:05:29,641 --> 01:05:30,881
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what it was for me, too.

939
01:05:30,921 --> 01:05:32,581
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't word it that strongly, but yes.

940
01:05:33,322 --> 01:05:34,942
[SPEAKER_01]: We want people to actually buy our game.

941
01:05:35,462 --> 01:05:37,103
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to put it on a system that people are buying.

942
01:05:37,283 --> 01:05:39,103
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's what it was for me.

943
01:05:39,483 --> 01:05:44,684
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the way I would phrase it, is that it was really a company kind of acknowledging, Sony ain't selling the way we thought it would.

944
01:05:45,064 --> 01:05:47,085
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to have to go put this game out on Microsoft as well.

945
01:05:47,105 --> 01:05:48,525
[SPEAKER_02]: Or they figured out, hey, guess what?

946
01:05:48,705 --> 01:05:53,406
[SPEAKER_02]: It isn't that hard to develop for the 360 and the PlayStation 3 at the same time.

947
01:05:53,766 --> 01:05:55,027
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty easy to port the code over.

948
01:05:55,247 --> 01:05:55,847
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do that.

949
01:05:56,624 --> 01:05:57,084
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

950
01:05:57,404 --> 01:05:57,744
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

951
01:05:57,864 --> 01:06:04,827
[SPEAKER_04]: I would throw a bonus one in and say basically Stranglehold having so much expectation it ended up being a bust.

952
01:06:04,847 --> 01:06:05,407
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's right.

953
01:06:05,427 --> 01:06:06,748
[SPEAKER_06]: Stranglehold was released in March.

954
01:06:06,768 --> 01:06:07,548
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember that.

955
01:06:07,928 --> 01:06:08,688
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it wasn't.

956
01:06:09,029 --> 01:06:09,329
[SPEAKER_06]: Was it?

957
01:06:09,549 --> 01:06:10,589
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was in March or later.

958
01:06:10,609 --> 01:06:12,850
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was in September and October.

959
01:06:13,050 --> 01:06:13,410
[SPEAKER_06]: Was it?

960
01:06:13,610 --> 01:06:13,850
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

961
01:06:14,090 --> 01:06:16,131
[SPEAKER_06]: But it seemed like this game, like it was at E3.

962
01:06:16,171 --> 01:06:18,472
[SPEAKER_06]: We first saw it at E3 like a year and a half ago.

963
01:06:19,324 --> 01:06:27,289
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was supposed to be like a release title for the 360 at one point the way they showed it.

964
01:06:27,349 --> 01:06:30,250
[SPEAKER_06]: It probably was originally supposed to come out in March and got delayed that whole time.

965
01:06:30,871 --> 01:06:32,972
[SPEAKER_06]: That might be true, but... Alright, well anyway.

966
01:06:33,332 --> 01:06:34,413
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's talk about April.

967
01:06:35,074 --> 01:06:44,916
[SPEAKER_06]: Episode 226 kicked off April, and one of the top stories from that episode was the announcement that Sonic and Mario were going to be teaming up for a new game, Mario and Sonic at the Olympics.

968
01:06:45,477 --> 01:06:46,617
[SPEAKER_02]: And nobody cared.

969
01:06:46,857 --> 01:06:48,657
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, hold on.

970
01:06:49,077 --> 01:06:55,819
[SPEAKER_06]: Now they don't, because after the game came out, I don't think most people cared anymore, but the week this was announced, this was huge news.

971
01:06:56,179 --> 01:06:59,160
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of why I bring this up, because people were like, OMG, Sonic and Mario...

972
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:03,663
[SPEAKER_06]: But now, you know, obviously since then we've had Sonic be announced in Brawl and all that stuff too.

973
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:10,788
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's not such a big deal, but at the time it was like, OMG, my childhood, you know, fantasies in some way.

974
01:07:11,028 --> 01:07:13,449
[SPEAKER_06]: Or, you know, the thing you never thought would happen is happening.

975
01:07:13,489 --> 01:07:14,930
[SPEAKER_06]: Sonic and Mario in the same game.

976
01:07:15,771 --> 01:07:15,931
[SPEAKER_06]: True.

977
01:07:16,632 --> 01:07:17,292
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a big announcement.

978
01:07:17,662 --> 01:07:18,142
[SPEAKER_06]: Episode 227 in April

979
01:07:36,974 --> 01:07:38,355
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

980
01:08:02,558 --> 01:08:06,240
[SPEAKER_04]: and then like the Drum Mania Guitar Freaks thing.

981
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:11,763
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, and I think that's what it was for me is that, you know, obviously you had Guitar Freaks, Drum Mania, Keyboard Mania in the arcades years ago.

982
01:08:11,884 --> 01:08:17,207
[SPEAKER_06]: It just kind of surprised me that it was like, whoa, somebody's actually going to try and do this in the U.S.

983
01:08:17,267 --> 01:08:21,209
[SPEAKER_06]: and they are going to put it all in one game and they're going to put it all in one box and see if it sells.

984
01:08:21,329 --> 01:08:24,051
[SPEAKER_06]: That is fucking ambitious right there.

985
01:08:24,151 --> 01:08:29,234
[SPEAKER_04]: And the ultimate kicker was they added, they had a singing part to it.

986
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:31,640
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the ultimate kicker.

987
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:35,622
[SPEAKER_04]: The ultimate breakdown was that you put singing into it.

988
01:08:35,962 --> 01:08:38,263
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like a big deal.

989
01:08:38,963 --> 01:08:40,664
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially with the popularity of karaoke games.

990
01:08:41,364 --> 01:08:43,665
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Loki, sing it.

991
01:08:44,185 --> 01:08:45,385
[SPEAKER_06]: Episode number 228.

992
01:08:45,846 --> 01:08:48,267
[SPEAKER_06]: A story that definitely stuck out for us in episode 228.

993
01:08:48,787 --> 01:08:54,449
[SPEAKER_06]: A woman who played on the game World of Warcraft posted an ad on Craigslist offering sex...

994
01:08:55,433 --> 01:08:57,816
[SPEAKER_06]: to get the gold to buy her epic mount.

995
01:09:14,122 --> 01:09:17,024
[SPEAKER_06]: I would be curious what that woman's up to now.

996
01:09:17,304 --> 01:09:18,544
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, did she do it again?

997
01:09:18,604 --> 01:09:19,985
[SPEAKER_04]: I got on top of that, actually.

998
01:09:20,425 --> 01:09:21,706
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I've never talked about it.

999
01:09:21,926 --> 01:09:24,047
[SPEAKER_04]: How about once, I mean, but it probably has happened.

1000
01:09:24,568 --> 01:09:28,650
[SPEAKER_04]: An Australian lady met a young teenager online through WoW.

1001
01:09:29,450 --> 01:09:32,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Paid her way to Content America to visit him.

1002
01:09:34,033 --> 01:09:35,093
[SPEAKER_06]: I do remember hearing about this.

1003
01:09:35,133 --> 01:09:37,734
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we might have covered this on the show, but yeah, it's similar.

1004
01:09:37,774 --> 01:09:39,575
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a similar story in some ways.

1005
01:09:40,256 --> 01:09:42,437
[SPEAKER_06]: It's crazy what some people get into on WoW.

1006
01:09:43,211 --> 01:09:47,374
[SPEAKER_06]: But you know, I gotta say, as a World of Warcraft player, those epic mounts really are a bitch to get.

1007
01:09:47,434 --> 01:09:49,715
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I almost am ready to put out to get one.

1008
01:09:50,255 --> 01:09:52,597
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's why I don't touch that game.

1009
01:09:53,137 --> 01:09:53,718
[SPEAKER_06]: Not really, though.

1010
01:09:53,738 --> 01:09:54,238
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just kidding.

1011
01:09:54,578 --> 01:09:58,561
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, and then episode 229 was the last episode we taped in April.

1012
01:09:59,041 --> 01:10:05,165
[SPEAKER_06]: It actually must have been a slow news week, because the top story I pulled from that one is that the PlayStation Eye was officially announced.

1013
01:10:05,585 --> 01:10:10,528
[SPEAKER_06]: But actually, I think the reason why this is relevant is because obviously, you know, a lot of us are kind of wondering, you know,

1014
01:10:11,534 --> 01:10:18,319
[SPEAKER_06]: Sony showed this off at E3 and it disappeared for the longest time.

1015
01:10:18,359 --> 01:10:23,563
[SPEAKER_06]: We never heard anything about the Eye of Judgment and then suddenly out of nowhere, bam, here it is, the PlayStation Eyes coming out.

1016
01:10:23,823 --> 01:10:26,005
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think this might have been the episode where Loki made the bet.

1017
01:10:26,065 --> 01:10:26,625
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember.

1018
01:10:26,826 --> 01:10:27,626
[SPEAKER_06]: It might have been over the summer.

1019
01:10:28,066 --> 01:10:29,708
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it was later.

1020
01:10:29,908 --> 01:10:32,770
[SPEAKER_06]: But regardless, the PlayStation Eye was officially announced in episode 229.

1021
01:10:32,810 --> 01:10:33,130
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, like...

1022
01:10:36,036 --> 01:10:38,944
[SPEAKER_04]: It just, it seemed like the news was pretty slow.

1023
01:10:39,004 --> 01:10:44,499
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, I'm trying to remember when I debuted because I think I did, I think I was working on that one.

1024
01:10:44,519 --> 01:10:44,920
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like...

1025
01:10:45,529 --> 01:10:51,831
[SPEAKER_04]: Out of those four stories, Sonic and Mario team up, Rock Band announced, a woman in World of Warcraft puts out for her mount, and the PlayStation Eye officially announced.

1026
01:10:51,911 --> 01:10:54,492
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think had the biggest impact in gaming from April?

1027
01:10:54,512 --> 01:10:54,552
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh...

1028
01:11:07,737 --> 01:11:21,732
[SPEAKER_04]: I would probably have to say at first I was thinking about Mario and Sonic thing but to be honest I think the World of Warcraft thing just be on the grounds of it involves sex for fake money.

1029
01:11:23,266 --> 01:11:24,708
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1030
01:11:38,436 --> 01:11:44,017
[SPEAKER_04]: Other than what happened later on in the years that made it worse and brought everything back ahead again.

1031
01:11:44,498 --> 01:11:53,340
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the reason why that is important to gaming in general in 2007, because I think 99.9% of people looked at that story and went, I don't want that to be me, ever.

1032
01:11:54,020 --> 01:11:57,681
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, even the most hardcore gamers were like, I do not want that to be me, ever.

1033
01:11:57,801 --> 01:11:58,181
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

1034
01:11:58,201 --> 01:12:01,002
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a way to keep us in check.

1035
01:12:01,122 --> 01:12:02,022
[SPEAKER_04]: But here's the kicker, though.

1036
01:12:02,042 --> 01:12:02,382
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1037
01:12:03,138 --> 01:12:12,701
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate to bring politics into this, but I don't know if y'all heard, but apparently a presidential candidate done scheduled a parade in WoW.

1038
01:12:14,502 --> 01:12:15,782
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, this is recent?

1039
01:12:16,802 --> 01:12:17,743
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this is recent.

1040
01:12:18,063 --> 01:12:18,743
[SPEAKER_04]: Ron Paul.

1041
01:12:19,463 --> 01:12:20,363
[SPEAKER_06]: Riffing.

1042
01:12:21,044 --> 01:12:21,684
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

1043
01:12:22,344 --> 01:12:25,005
[SPEAKER_04]: Ron Paul, apparently he got some people to...

1044
01:12:25,612 --> 01:12:44,911
[SPEAKER_04]: or somebody might set it up, I don't know apparently he got, they're gonna do like a little um, campaigning parade on WoW I forgot what, things from Ironforge to some area and what not and I was like, wow they definitely they definitely having the goal to go for this one I remember jokingly said um

1045
01:12:45,854 --> 01:12:48,155
[SPEAKER_04]: Great, if this pulls off, they're going to win the nerd vote.

1046
01:12:48,615 --> 01:12:48,935
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

1047
01:12:49,055 --> 01:12:51,036
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

1048
01:12:51,056 --> 01:12:51,996
[SPEAKER_06]: 2008 is going to be a hell of a year.

1049
01:12:52,056 --> 01:12:56,697
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, this is about as cool as Dr. Evil in Austin Powers.

1050
01:12:57,057 --> 01:12:57,418
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hip.

1051
01:12:57,558 --> 01:12:58,018
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm cool.

1052
01:12:58,158 --> 01:12:58,338
[SPEAKER_02]: See?

1053
01:12:58,358 --> 01:12:58,498
[SPEAKER_02]: Aw.

1054
01:13:03,311 --> 01:13:05,132
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1055
01:13:20,098 --> 01:13:22,381
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, somebody like, you know, Hillary Clinton.

1056
01:13:22,561 --> 01:13:24,023
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, she's a big presidential candidate.

1057
01:13:24,063 --> 01:13:26,165
[SPEAKER_06]: She's pissed a lot of people off with her stance.

1058
01:13:26,205 --> 01:13:28,207
[SPEAKER_06]: And she kind of, remember, she backtracked.

1059
01:13:28,267 --> 01:13:30,590
[SPEAKER_06]: Like earlier in the year, she was kind of more anti-video game.

1060
01:13:30,610 --> 01:13:36,276
[SPEAKER_06]: And then she kind of came out and supported the ESRB a little later and said, you know, we've done a lot of work and da-da-da.

1061
01:13:36,356 --> 01:13:37,577
[SPEAKER_06]: It was very interesting.

1062
01:13:37,637 --> 01:13:38,638
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when Manhunt 2 happened, she went back.

1063
01:13:38,658 --> 01:13:40,080
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't say anything for your vote.

1064
01:13:43,038 --> 01:13:46,600
[SPEAKER_06]: All I can say is 2008 is going to be a hell of a year with the election going on and everything.

1065
01:13:47,881 --> 01:13:49,222
[SPEAKER_06]: Dark Knight, let's hear it.

1066
01:13:49,302 --> 01:13:51,963
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think, in your opinion, was the worst game of 2007?

1067
01:13:52,043 --> 01:13:55,826
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to agree with Raven's Dolphin and it was Yars.

1068
01:13:56,806 --> 01:13:58,567
[SPEAKER_04]: I played it once and never touched it again.

1069
01:13:58,587 --> 01:14:03,450
[SPEAKER_04]: I basically gave it the what the hell was I smoking when I played this game award.

1070
01:14:04,891 --> 01:14:10,255
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, in your opinion, what was the hands down, above all, best freaking game of 2007?

1071
01:14:12,115 --> 01:14:21,101
[SPEAKER_04]: So many games, but I had to go with Call of Duty 4 because the game could basically be turned into a movie by itself.

1072
01:14:21,461 --> 01:14:24,383
[SPEAKER_04]: You wouldn't need no actors or anything like that.

1073
01:14:24,823 --> 01:14:28,826
[SPEAKER_04]: Just put the game in, let it run its course, it's the Oscar hit.

1074
01:14:28,986 --> 01:14:32,348
[SPEAKER_06]: I think as I've heard somebody describe Call of Duty 4, it's just fucking epic.

1075
01:14:33,449 --> 01:14:33,809
[SPEAKER_04]: It is.

1076
01:14:33,989 --> 01:14:34,870
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just fucking epic.

1077
01:14:36,271 --> 01:14:39,593
[SPEAKER_04]: Best person to ask about that, talk to Travis.

1078
01:14:40,333 --> 01:14:40,714
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a veteran.

1079
01:14:42,428 --> 01:14:43,028
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a veteran.

1080
01:14:43,388 --> 01:14:43,889
[SPEAKER_06]: He'll tell you.

1081
01:15:08,212 --> 01:15:09,212
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I said, I was there.

1082
01:15:09,232 --> 01:15:12,493
[SPEAKER_04]: Trust me, I was part of that shenanigans, that episode.

1083
01:15:13,513 --> 01:15:14,053
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of fun.

1084
01:15:14,213 --> 01:15:14,653
[SPEAKER_06]: Good times.

1085
01:15:15,054 --> 01:15:17,814
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Dark Knight, we got to let you go, but thanks so much for participating tonight.

1086
01:15:17,934 --> 01:15:19,274
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a great 2008, all right?

1087
01:15:19,795 --> 01:15:20,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for having me on.

1088
01:15:20,555 --> 01:15:21,395
[SPEAKER_04]: Y'all guys do the same.

1089
01:15:21,415 --> 01:15:21,855
[SPEAKER_04]: Take care.

1090
01:15:21,995 --> 01:15:22,435
[SPEAKER_06]: Take care, buddy.

1091
01:15:23,175 --> 01:15:23,355
Bye.

1092
01:15:24,196 --> 01:15:24,596
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1093
01:15:24,856 --> 01:15:25,636
[SPEAKER_06]: Dark Knight there.

1094
01:15:25,896 --> 01:15:27,456
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see if we get somebody else to join us.

1095
01:15:27,516 --> 01:15:30,117
[SPEAKER_06]: Talk about, we're going to do May and June.

1096
01:15:30,137 --> 01:15:33,918
[SPEAKER_06]: I know it's a little different from what we have there, but since we're giving everybody two months, we'll go ahead and do May and June.

1097
01:15:33,938 --> 01:15:34,818
[SPEAKER_06]: We got somebody on the line.

1098
01:15:34,858 --> 01:15:35,398
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, who's there?

1099
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:37,821
[SPEAKER_03]: Yo, it's Xenocore from the Ultimate Quest.

1100
01:15:37,841 --> 01:15:38,201
[SPEAKER_03]: How you guys doing?

1101
01:15:38,221 --> 01:15:39,402
[SPEAKER_03]: What is up, Xenocore?

1102
01:15:39,422 --> 01:15:40,042
[SPEAKER_03]: How you doing?

1103
01:15:40,982 --> 01:15:42,883
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still alive, you know, paying bills and such.

1104
01:15:43,243 --> 01:15:43,944
[SPEAKER_06]: How was your holiday?

1105
01:15:43,984 --> 01:15:44,224
[SPEAKER_06]: Good?

1106
01:15:45,184 --> 01:15:45,905
[SPEAKER_03]: I got two shirts.

1107
01:15:47,205 --> 01:15:48,266
[SPEAKER_06]: I got clothes, too.

1108
01:15:49,166 --> 01:15:50,127
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, man.

1109
01:15:50,187 --> 01:15:50,827
[SPEAKER_06]: Clothing is good.

1110
01:15:50,987 --> 01:15:51,427
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

1111
01:15:51,447 --> 01:15:53,068
[SPEAKER_06]: It keeps you warm during these cold months.

1112
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:56,110
[SPEAKER_01]: Christmas is intended to give you underwear and socks.

1113
01:15:57,270 --> 01:15:58,731
[SPEAKER_06]: How are things over at the Ultimate Quest?

1114
01:15:59,011 --> 01:16:00,512
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you guys doing your own year-end wrap-up?

1115
01:16:01,700 --> 01:16:03,561
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we pretty much finished our shows for the year.

1116
01:16:03,601 --> 01:16:07,223
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going on hiatus for the new year, so I can get inebriated at least.

1117
01:16:09,265 --> 01:16:11,226
[SPEAKER_03]: But we'll be picking up next year, I think.

1118
01:16:12,509 --> 01:16:14,410
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1119
01:16:37,479 --> 01:16:38,219
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching!

1120
01:16:59,588 --> 01:17:00,629
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's pretty cool.

1121
01:17:00,669 --> 01:17:02,269
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be sure to pass that message along.

1122
01:17:02,389 --> 01:17:15,175
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought Footy would get a kick out of that, because sometimes, you know, Argentina is a huge fucking country, but it doesn't get mentioned enough, usually, and, you know, because the gaming scene just isn't what it is here or there, you know what I mean?

1123
01:17:16,075 --> 01:17:20,037
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very different, as he lets us know very much so on the show.

1124
01:17:20,437 --> 01:17:22,378
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well, enough about people who aren't here.

1125
01:17:22,478 --> 01:17:28,341
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's talk about the year in review, and talk a little bit about, did you kill the fly, Loki?

1126
01:17:29,361 --> 01:17:30,202
[SPEAKER_01]: There's another one, though.

1127
01:17:59,986 --> 01:18:01,307
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, man, mutton's good for you.

1128
01:18:01,527 --> 01:18:08,472
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my gosh, and PETA, understandably, was pissed off about that, and the rest of us were wondering, what the F were they thinking?

1129
01:18:09,493 --> 01:18:16,778
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think they actually killed the goat live, but they had the dead goat, like, everywhere, and it was just kind of like, what the crap were you people thinking?

1130
01:18:18,919 --> 01:18:20,340
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was pretty humorous.

1131
01:18:20,420 --> 01:18:23,542
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, didn't he at least make mutton or stew out of it or anything?

1132
01:18:23,562 --> 01:18:25,824
[SPEAKER_03]: He just had a dead carcass right there, smelling of the place?

1133
01:18:26,104 --> 01:18:26,684
[SPEAKER_07]: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

1134
01:18:27,385 --> 01:18:27,665
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

1135
01:18:28,446 --> 01:18:30,148
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, FootyMonster's actually in chat.

1136
01:18:30,188 --> 01:18:33,332
[SPEAKER_06]: He just said something about Guido.

1137
01:18:33,352 --> 01:18:33,812
[SPEAKER_06]: That's funny.

1138
01:18:35,254 --> 01:18:35,774
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, sorry.

1139
01:18:35,954 --> 01:18:36,575
[SPEAKER_06]: I got distracted.

1140
01:18:36,655 --> 01:18:37,356
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, episode number 231.

1141
01:18:37,576 --> 01:18:40,099
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, you'd like this as a roleplay fan.

1142
01:18:40,912 --> 01:18:47,794
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the stories that stuck out from episode 231, Final Fantasy 4 was announced that it was going to be remade for the DS.

1143
01:18:48,094 --> 01:18:57,716
[SPEAKER_06]: This is much different from what Squeenix had been doing with the past Final Fantasy games and releasing them, but they were going to remake all of Final Fantasy 4 similar to how they did with Final Fantasy 3.

1144
01:18:58,756 --> 01:19:00,497
[SPEAKER_06]: And now the game is out in Japan.

1145
01:19:00,537 --> 01:19:07,338
[SPEAKER_06]: We're still waiting for it here in the U.S., but certainly had people thinking different ways about that.

1146
01:19:07,378 --> 01:19:09,499
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think about the Final Fantasy 4 remake on the DS?

1147
01:19:10,729 --> 01:19:15,552
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm all for the remakes when they switch to another console that wasn't on previously.

1148
01:19:15,572 --> 01:19:18,694
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just going to print more money once it gets released over there.

1149
01:19:19,181 --> 01:19:20,022
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

1150
01:19:42,798 --> 01:19:46,041
[SPEAKER_06]: and I'm just like, please, please, Square Enix, do not fuck this up.

1151
01:19:46,081 --> 01:19:50,164
[SPEAKER_06]: But then when I saw the screen caps and the previews, I'm like, wow, this actually looks pretty awesome.

1152
01:19:51,045 --> 01:19:51,445
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

1153
01:19:51,685 --> 01:19:53,046
[SPEAKER_06]: Kane's Dragoon jump for the win.

1154
01:19:53,306 --> 01:19:56,209
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, looking for... Ooh, it's going to be great.

1155
01:19:56,229 --> 01:20:00,452
[SPEAKER_06]: Episode 232, big week for PC gamers because that was the week that StarCraft II was announced.

1156
01:20:01,420 --> 01:20:05,124
[SPEAKER_06]: and Blizzard reviving one of their franchises that had been a little bit dormant.

1157
01:20:05,304 --> 01:20:13,652
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, obviously we had the rumors of StarCraft Ghost years ago and everybody kind of thought, you know, this had to come eventually and finally it arrived in May, the announcement of StarCraft 2.

1158
01:20:15,974 --> 01:20:20,458
[SPEAKER_06]: Episode 233 was the one we taped live at Fanime and that was the week

1159
01:20:21,918 --> 01:20:22,979
[SPEAKER_06]: Super Smash Bros.

1160
01:20:23,079 --> 01:20:23,460
[SPEAKER_06]: Brawl

1161
01:20:50,467 --> 01:20:53,989
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a rough one, because it is getting quite a lot of hype.

1162
01:20:55,010 --> 01:21:01,394
[SPEAKER_03]: Whenever I start seeing games advertised this much, I just expect it to fall short a certain degree.

1163
01:21:01,454 --> 01:21:06,998
[SPEAKER_03]: Just from process of elimination over the years, whenever a game gets hyped up, it always falls short one or two spots.

1164
01:21:07,899 --> 01:21:10,660
[SPEAKER_03]: If it does, I'm going to be surprised, but if it does not, then all the better.

1165
01:21:11,961 --> 01:21:19,066
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially if it is true what Loki said earlier, and it does turn to be true that the game gets delayed another month, it's going to have to be that much better.

1166
01:21:19,895 --> 01:21:21,076
[SPEAKER_06]: to make it worth the wait.

1167
01:21:21,536 --> 01:21:25,558
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's a first-party game, so it's not going to get released when it's complete crap.

1168
01:21:25,598 --> 01:21:26,118
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no way.

1169
01:21:26,238 --> 01:21:26,838
[SPEAKER_03]: True, true.

1170
01:21:27,199 --> 01:21:34,282
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, okay, out of those stories, PETA and the God of War Go, Final Fantasy IV Remake, StarCraft II announced, and Super Smash Bros.

1171
01:21:34,322 --> 01:21:37,564
[SPEAKER_06]: Revealed, what do you think was the story that had the biggest impact in gaming?

1172
01:21:37,664 --> 01:21:40,045
[SPEAKER_06]: Or if you have something else you want to throw in there, go for it.

1173
01:21:40,785 --> 01:21:50,337
[SPEAKER_03]: No, mainly I'd go with the story with the Guard of War carcass just because it spills over to mainstream media when you see stuff like that and it brings attention to the gaming world.

1174
01:21:50,497 --> 01:21:51,738
[SPEAKER_03]: And not the good kind of attention.

1175
01:21:52,940 --> 01:21:54,782
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's definitely bad attention.

1176
01:21:55,363 --> 01:21:56,344
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to agree with you there.

1177
01:21:56,384 --> 01:21:57,786
[SPEAKER_06]: That's probably what I would pick too.

1178
01:21:58,450 --> 01:21:59,451
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely would pick that one.

1179
01:21:59,771 --> 01:22:00,932
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well, let's move on to June.

1180
01:22:00,972 --> 01:22:02,533
[SPEAKER_06]: We only taped three shows in June.

1181
01:22:02,553 --> 01:22:03,254
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what happened.

1182
01:22:03,274 --> 01:22:04,475
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess we fell asleep.

1183
01:22:04,855 --> 01:22:06,417
[SPEAKER_06]: Or maybe another Disneyland trip happened in there.

1184
01:22:06,437 --> 01:22:06,877
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure.

1185
01:22:06,897 --> 01:22:07,598
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a Disneyland trip.

1186
01:22:07,618 --> 01:22:07,958
[SPEAKER_06]: Was there?

1187
01:22:08,038 --> 01:22:09,799
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well, there were three shows taped in June.

1188
01:22:10,180 --> 01:22:15,944
[SPEAKER_06]: Episode 234, that was the week, I love this, that was the week that Ubisoft apologized for making crappy Wii games.

1189
01:22:16,525 --> 01:22:17,426
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you remember that one?

1190
01:22:17,726 --> 01:22:20,768
[SPEAKER_06]: That they said, you know what, maybe we shouldn't have done so many ports.

1191
01:22:22,910 --> 01:22:26,393
[SPEAKER_06]: Just to have a game company, even though, you know, obviously, this was

1192
01:22:26,752 --> 01:22:26,852
[SPEAKER_06]: 3Speak

1193
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:53,501
[SPEAKER_06]: Finally, that was launched in June of 2007.

1194
01:22:54,041 --> 01:22:56,763
[SPEAKER_06]: And obviously, Sony had been kind of trying to catch up.

1195
01:22:57,503 --> 01:23:01,105
[SPEAKER_06]: You might remember from the year before, All I Want for Xmas is a PSP.com.

1196
01:23:01,925 --> 01:23:02,626
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I remember that one.

1197
01:23:02,646 --> 01:23:04,186
[SPEAKER_06]: Didn't go so well that time.

1198
01:23:05,147 --> 01:23:09,409
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, most people were saying, you know what, Sony really needs like a Major Nelson.

1199
01:23:09,449 --> 01:23:13,872
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, Nintendo has their poster kids with Miyamoto and Reggie Fils-Aimé.

1200
01:23:14,172 --> 01:23:19,034
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, Microsoft has, you know, Major Nelson and Trixie and people that are out there in the community.

1201
01:23:19,434 --> 01:23:20,175
[SPEAKER_06]: Sony's got...

1202
01:23:20,928 --> 01:23:22,469
[SPEAKER_06]: Crazy Crayon Eatin' Ken.

1203
01:23:24,229 --> 01:23:26,630
[SPEAKER_01]: If they hired me, I bet you I could sell PS3s.

1204
01:23:27,311 --> 01:23:28,471
[SPEAKER_06]: How would you sell a PlayStation 3?

1205
01:23:28,971 --> 01:23:31,852
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, I'd restore it to its original format.

1206
01:23:32,793 --> 01:23:36,414
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would have it with all of the goody stuff and a 40 gig hard drive.

1207
01:23:37,074 --> 01:23:39,715
[SPEAKER_01]: It would not have even had the option of having more.

1208
01:23:39,735 --> 01:23:40,356
[SPEAKER_06]: How would you sell it?

1209
01:23:40,376 --> 01:23:41,436
[SPEAKER_06]: What would that commercial look like?

1210
01:23:41,736 --> 01:23:42,316
[SPEAKER_01]: With boobs.

1211
01:23:43,637 --> 01:23:45,658
[SPEAKER_06]: Just women jumping on trampolines?

1212
01:23:46,298 --> 01:23:47,718
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that what it would be?

1213
01:23:48,099 --> 01:23:48,779
[SPEAKER_01]: It is going to have...

1214
01:23:49,412 --> 01:23:52,634
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you can have graphics this realistic on your PlayStation 3.

1215
01:23:53,614 --> 01:23:54,014
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, my God.

1216
01:23:54,475 --> 01:23:56,896
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, that is a brilliant idea for a commercial.

1217
01:23:57,536 --> 01:24:05,540
[SPEAKER_06]: Just all the commercial is is 30 seconds of boobs on trampolines, and then in the very last second, it says, generated by PlayStation 3.

1218
01:24:05,580 --> 01:24:07,821
[SPEAKER_06]: This is all real footage.

1219
01:24:07,841 --> 01:24:09,682
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds like Jamie should be working for Spike TV.

1220
01:24:10,943 --> 01:24:12,103
[SPEAKER_03]: Perhaps she should.

1221
01:24:13,424 --> 01:24:17,866
[SPEAKER_01]: Or have like a show like Barbecue.

1222
01:24:19,042 --> 01:24:22,005
[SPEAKER_01]: Because nothing will sell a game like boobs and barbecue.

1223
01:24:23,907 --> 01:24:27,511
[SPEAKER_06]: Macman says in the chatroom, Jamie would just tape a ferret to every PlayStation 3.

1224
01:24:27,551 --> 01:24:30,094
[SPEAKER_01]: Free ferret with every game.

1225
01:24:30,154 --> 01:24:33,637
[SPEAKER_06]: And Dark Knight wants to remember, how did that crayon-eating bit even start?

1226
01:24:33,878 --> 01:24:34,198
[SPEAKER_01]: Megsie.

1227
01:24:35,031 --> 01:24:35,592
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

1228
01:24:35,732 --> 01:24:37,974
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the OR lesbians started the Crayote thing.

1229
01:24:37,994 --> 01:24:38,814
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

1230
01:24:38,874 --> 01:24:40,596
[SPEAKER_06]: Captain Crayola, Star Tetsuya says.

1231
01:24:40,936 --> 01:24:41,156
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1232
01:24:41,176 --> 01:24:45,680
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, anyhow, out of those three stories, or if you have one of your own, Xenocore, Ubisoft apologizes.

1233
01:24:45,741 --> 01:24:46,882
[SPEAKER_06]: Sony launches their own blog.

1234
01:24:46,902 --> 01:24:47,242
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'm sorry.

1235
01:24:47,262 --> 01:24:48,443
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't even read the third one.

1236
01:24:48,843 --> 01:24:53,928
[SPEAKER_06]: Episode 236 was the week that Manhunt 2 officially got the AO rating.

1237
01:24:54,408 --> 01:24:57,371
[SPEAKER_06]: And, of course, this just began weeks upon weeks of

1238
01:24:58,322 --> 01:24:59,403
[SPEAKER_06]: ManHunt2 ManHunt2

1239
01:25:15,962 --> 01:25:20,948
[SPEAKER_06]: So out of those three stories, Ubisoft apologizing, Sony launching their official blog, and Manhunt 2 getting the ratings.

1240
01:25:21,008 --> 01:25:21,809
[SPEAKER_06]: Unicor, what do you think?

1241
01:25:22,109 --> 01:25:23,050
[SPEAKER_06]: Biggest impact?

1242
01:25:23,131 --> 01:25:24,672
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got to be the Manhunt 2 story.

1243
01:25:25,073 --> 01:25:27,576
[SPEAKER_03]: That went all across the globe on that one.

1244
01:25:27,676 --> 01:25:29,058
[SPEAKER_06]: Hands down, absolutely.

1245
01:25:29,662 --> 01:25:31,444
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1246
01:25:53,703 --> 01:26:01,668
[SPEAKER_06]: You can use pee as a... I don't... I always think... I think back to when I watched Survivor years ago and there was the guy... For snake bites.

1247
01:26:01,748 --> 01:26:06,331
[SPEAKER_06]: There was the guy going, the stingray just bit me, I need someone to pee on it.

1248
01:26:06,391 --> 01:26:10,774
[SPEAKER_06]: And so this lady goes over, squats on him and pees on it, and sure enough, disinfects it.

1249
01:26:10,814 --> 01:26:16,237
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's really better with your own pee because it breaks down the proteins in the toxin.

1250
01:26:16,477 --> 01:26:18,979
[SPEAKER_06]: I just remember the guy saying, I need someone to pee on it!

1251
01:26:19,359 --> 01:26:21,320
[SPEAKER_01]: Meat tenderizer works too for the same thing.

1252
01:26:22,061 --> 01:26:22,321
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow...

1253
01:26:23,428 --> 01:26:25,211
[SPEAKER_06]: Xenocore, what was the worst freaking game of 2007?

1254
01:26:39,369 --> 01:26:41,671
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's too easy of a target.

1255
01:26:41,711 --> 01:26:44,353
[SPEAKER_03]: I was trying to think of something else, but nothing comes to mind.

1256
01:26:44,573 --> 01:26:45,474
[SPEAKER_03]: Yaris needs to go.

1257
01:26:46,074 --> 01:26:49,877
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoever developed it needs to have their names published so they can't get another job in the aiming industry.

1258
01:26:49,897 --> 01:26:51,078
[SPEAKER_03]: It's as simple as that.

1259
01:26:51,378 --> 01:26:53,139
[SPEAKER_06]: Three out of three have named Yaris.

1260
01:26:53,259 --> 01:26:55,241
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a pick, and it's not Yaris.

1261
01:26:56,141 --> 01:26:57,963
[SPEAKER_06]: See, I can't think of another one.

1262
01:26:57,983 --> 01:26:58,924
[SPEAKER_06]: There's another one out there.

1263
01:26:58,964 --> 01:27:05,548
[SPEAKER_01]: I was actually going to tell you, the last issue of Xbox Magazine was listing Yaris as a piece of crap.

1264
01:27:06,369 --> 01:27:08,210
[SPEAKER_06]: The official Xbox Magazine, even.

1265
01:27:08,291 --> 01:27:08,811
[SPEAKER_06]: How sad.

1266
01:27:09,244 --> 01:27:09,704
[SPEAKER_06]: How's that?

1267
01:27:09,965 --> 01:27:11,686
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well, let's get to the good stuff, Xenocore.

1268
01:27:11,706 --> 01:27:14,308
[SPEAKER_06]: In your opinion, the best freaking game of 2007.

1269
01:27:14,508 --> 01:27:19,032
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I'll probably get more hate mail for that, but it gives me more to read on the show.

1270
01:27:19,472 --> 01:27:22,895
[SPEAKER_03]: But I've got to say Portal is the best game of the year.

1271
01:27:24,856 --> 01:27:25,597
[SPEAKER_06]: Why Portal?

1272
01:27:25,697 --> 01:27:28,799
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm surprised that I was waiting to write Persona 3.

1273
01:27:29,220 --> 01:27:32,842
[SPEAKER_06]: As an RPG player, I would have thought that was going to be your pick, but why Portal?

1274
01:27:33,603 --> 01:27:35,484
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's the most innovative title.

1275
01:27:35,504 --> 01:27:35,665
[SPEAKER_03]: Period.

1276
01:27:35,765 --> 01:27:36,245
[SPEAKER_03]: Period.

1277
01:27:36,781 --> 01:27:39,483
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody else is doing something that's been done before.

1278
01:27:39,763 --> 01:27:43,826
[SPEAKER_03]: As good as Super Mario Galaxy is, Ratchet and Clank beat them to the market with it.

1279
01:27:43,926 --> 01:27:46,007
[SPEAKER_03]: Rather or not, they've developed it already.

1280
01:27:46,787 --> 01:27:48,749
[SPEAKER_03]: Bioshock was a big disappointment for me.

1281
01:27:48,829 --> 01:27:50,830
[SPEAKER_03]: It was good in the beginning, but it sucked at the end.

1282
01:27:51,090 --> 01:27:52,391
[SPEAKER_03]: In hindsight, it's like, what?

1283
01:27:53,011 --> 01:27:53,772
[SPEAKER_03]: What's all this stuff?

1284
01:27:54,332 --> 01:27:55,513
[SPEAKER_03]: I threw Bioshock to the side.

1285
01:27:56,093 --> 01:27:58,335
[SPEAKER_03]: The others just didn't make a big of an impact as Portal.

1286
01:27:58,415 --> 01:27:59,996
[SPEAKER_03]: I can still go back and play Portal now.

1287
01:28:00,373 --> 01:28:01,573
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Portal gets the win.

1288
01:28:01,734 --> 01:28:02,554
[SPEAKER_06]: You never know, Xenocore.

1289
01:28:02,574 --> 01:28:04,695
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to be recapping our picks later in the show.

1290
01:28:04,755 --> 01:28:08,796
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'll bet you at least one of the three of us agrees with you that Portal was the best game of 2007.

1291
01:28:10,357 --> 01:28:11,457
[SPEAKER_06]: But we'll find out for sure.

1292
01:28:11,497 --> 01:28:11,837
[SPEAKER_06]: You never know.

1293
01:28:11,917 --> 01:28:13,598
[SPEAKER_06]: Surprises, there are many.

1294
01:28:13,978 --> 01:28:15,138
[SPEAKER_06]: So, we'll get to that a little later in the show.

1295
01:28:15,158 --> 01:28:17,959
[SPEAKER_06]: But, Xenocore, thank you so much for joining us.

1296
01:28:18,019 --> 01:28:20,040
[SPEAKER_06]: And we always have appreciated your calls throughout 2007.

1297
01:28:20,500 --> 01:28:23,701
[SPEAKER_06]: Best of luck to you and the whole crew at the Ultimate Quest for 2008, all right?

1298
01:28:24,642 --> 01:28:25,062
[SPEAKER_03]: No problem.

1299
01:28:25,102 --> 01:28:25,662
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks a lot, guys.

1300
01:28:25,722 --> 01:28:26,002
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1301
01:28:26,062 --> 01:28:26,522
[SPEAKER_06]: Take care, buddy.

1302
01:28:27,263 --> 01:28:27,563
Bye-bye.

1303
01:28:27,883 --> 01:28:28,143
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye-bye.

1304
01:28:28,666 --> 01:28:29,187
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

1305
01:28:52,537 --> 01:28:56,421
[SPEAKER_06]: Classic Game of the Year Classic Game of the Year Classic Game of the Year

1306
01:29:14,079 --> 01:29:15,319
[SPEAKER_06]: and let's hear it.

1307
01:29:15,740 --> 01:29:18,921
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the year?

1308
01:29:19,061 --> 01:29:23,982
[SPEAKER_01]: The classic game of the year is one of the best games ever in the universe.

1309
01:29:25,002 --> 01:29:35,126
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Parodius da Shinwakara Owariye, which translates to Parodius from Myth to Laughter.

1310
01:29:36,206 --> 01:29:39,587
[SPEAKER_01]: And the version that I have for our music is

1311
01:29:40,387 --> 01:29:45,091
[SPEAKER_01]: is the PC Engine release of it.

1312
01:29:45,471 --> 01:29:52,777
[SPEAKER_01]: Because honestly, and I've played through the Super Famicom one, it lags so badly.

1313
01:29:53,377 --> 01:29:57,040
[SPEAKER_01]: It has bad flicker and slowdown because it's a lot of stuff to process.

1314
01:29:58,341 --> 01:29:59,762
[SPEAKER_01]: The PC Engine did it better.

1315
01:29:59,922 --> 01:30:05,767
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is, as you can probably tell from the name, Parodius is a parody of Gradius.

1316
01:30:07,141 --> 01:30:08,882
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually is the second one in the series.

1317
01:30:08,922 --> 01:30:13,804
[SPEAKER_01]: The first Parodius came out on the MSX system.

1318
01:30:14,324 --> 01:30:20,027
[SPEAKER_01]: But in this one you get to play, you've actually got your different power-up abilities based on what character you pick.

1319
01:30:20,367 --> 01:30:22,388
[SPEAKER_01]: You can play the Vic Viper from Gradius.

1320
01:30:22,932 --> 01:30:23,953
[SPEAKER_01]: You can play an octopus.

1321
01:30:24,233 --> 01:30:25,974
[SPEAKER_01]: You can play a twin bee.

1322
01:30:26,274 --> 01:30:27,995
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the one where you fight the stripper.

1323
01:30:28,895 --> 01:30:30,916
[SPEAKER_06]: They're the Vegas showgirl or whatever she is.

1324
01:30:31,116 --> 01:30:31,757
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, my God.

1325
01:30:31,797 --> 01:30:32,477
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember this one.

1326
01:30:32,977 --> 01:30:34,178
[SPEAKER_01]: By going in between her legs.

1327
01:30:36,179 --> 01:30:38,100
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, why did Proteus never come out in the U.S.?

1328
01:30:38,520 --> 01:30:39,240
[SPEAKER_01]: It came out in Europe.

1329
01:30:40,301 --> 01:30:41,161
[SPEAKER_06]: But why never here?

1330
01:30:41,241 --> 01:30:45,023
[SPEAKER_01]: Were we just not, I mean, the showgirl thing we just wanted to get?

1331
01:30:45,103 --> 01:30:45,964
[SPEAKER_01]: Too far up their ass.

1332
01:30:47,395 --> 01:30:52,877
[SPEAKER_06]: So basically, I mean, and for those of you that may be kind of looking at Jamie right now going, what the heck, why are you picking this type thing?

1333
01:30:53,218 --> 01:30:55,759
[SPEAKER_06]: You really do have to imagine that this game is Gradius on crack.

1334
01:30:56,299 --> 01:30:56,559
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1335
01:30:56,719 --> 01:31:02,342
[SPEAKER_06]: And what makes this game so freaking epic is just the fact that I think it was mostly ignored here in the U.S.

1336
01:31:02,382 --> 01:31:03,702
[SPEAKER_01]: But you had the Moai stage.

1337
01:31:04,843 --> 01:31:07,564
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, you know, Konami games have to have the Moai head in there.

1338
01:31:07,764 --> 01:31:08,244
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.

1339
01:31:08,264 --> 01:31:11,966
[SPEAKER_01]: But the way that the power-ups worked, I thought it was cool.

1340
01:31:11,986 --> 01:31:14,447
[SPEAKER_01]: The Vic Viper is the old-school Gradius config.

1341
01:31:14,867 --> 01:31:16,968
[SPEAKER_01]: The Octopus is the Salamander configuration.

1342
01:31:18,413 --> 01:31:22,776
[SPEAKER_01]: Twinbee is the Twinbee configuration, even with the rocket with the punching fists.

1343
01:31:23,997 --> 01:31:27,019
[SPEAKER_01]: And Pentaro is Gradius III.

1344
01:31:27,559 --> 01:31:30,881
[SPEAKER_01]: I always would play as Twinbee because I love the rocket fists, but...

1345
01:31:31,725 --> 01:31:36,350
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also really cool, and the one that we're watching is actually the big viper playing through, because you get the option and double and all that.

1346
01:31:36,430 --> 01:31:37,971
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, let's just like Radius 2 when you play it that way.

1347
01:31:38,371 --> 01:31:43,276
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, the thing that, my favorite weapon in the whole thing... Maybe this is a reason why it didn't come out in the US.

1348
01:31:43,296 --> 01:31:44,157
[SPEAKER_01]: Because of the eagle?

1349
01:31:44,277 --> 01:31:52,364
[SPEAKER_06]: I noticed that the boss monster that's being fought right now is an American eagle, wearing a Yankee hat and a little bow tie, and just exploded.

1350
01:31:53,165 --> 01:31:57,309
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, um, a little bit more, um, is that, uh,

1351
01:31:58,363 --> 01:32:02,067
[SPEAKER_01]: One of your power-ups in the game is a bell, and you keep shooting the bell.

1352
01:32:02,868 --> 01:32:09,555
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you get a blue bell, it'll make your character grow big and anything it touches will be destroyed.

1353
01:32:10,075 --> 01:32:14,960
[SPEAKER_01]: If you get a green one, it's a big flare and destroys everything on the screen, including most bosses.

1354
01:32:16,502 --> 01:32:18,204
[SPEAKER_01]: That's actually how you beat the naked lady.

1355
01:32:20,042 --> 01:32:25,565
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the people that you fight is this woman wearing a sheet, and when you shoot her, she goes, oh, like that.

1356
01:32:26,545 --> 01:32:28,806
[SPEAKER_01]: And she blows little angels at you in bubbles.

1357
01:32:30,827 --> 01:32:33,388
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, here's a picture of her on the wiki.

1358
01:32:33,628 --> 01:32:34,628
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll get it in the chat room.

1359
01:32:34,648 --> 01:32:35,429
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice, nice.

1360
01:32:37,230 --> 01:32:43,072
[SPEAKER_01]: But she's really freaking hard to beat, so you usually have to have the mega flare by then, but they always give you a bell right before that stage.

1361
01:32:44,293 --> 01:32:47,434
[SPEAKER_01]: My favorite of those is the gray bell, which shouts words.

1362
01:32:48,556 --> 01:32:52,218
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, the whole phrases, like, you know, I think one of them is the equivalent of, like, Eat It Joes.

1363
01:32:52,938 --> 01:32:54,679
[SPEAKER_01]: And another one is E equals MC squared.

1364
01:32:55,999 --> 01:33:01,241
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, now, this is actually not my favorite in the Parodius, um, series.

1365
01:33:01,842 --> 01:33:06,404
[SPEAKER_01]: My favorite is, um, Jikyo Shibari Parodius, which, um, you can play on Saturn.

1366
01:33:06,864 --> 01:33:11,466
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the one that has, um, and for anyone who wants to know what it means, Chatting Parodius Live.

1367
01:33:13,048 --> 01:33:22,673
[SPEAKER_01]: For anyone who wants to know it, it has the Miracle Oopa, it has the Penguins, Pentoro, and Hanako, Twinbee and Winbee, Viper and Lord British from Gradius.

1368
01:33:25,154 --> 01:33:26,675
[SPEAKER_06]: Not to be confused with Richard Garriott.

1369
01:33:26,855 --> 01:33:27,055
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1370
01:33:27,816 --> 01:33:30,077
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has some girls riding on a missile.

1371
01:33:32,158 --> 01:33:39,442
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it has Aitsu and Koitsu, which for anyone who ever played Yu-Gi-Oh!, there's cards for them.

1372
01:33:40,592 --> 01:33:44,714
[SPEAKER_01]: There are these little stickmen riding on paper airplanes.

1373
01:33:45,455 --> 01:33:47,236
[SPEAKER_01]: But I just think that it's pretty cool.

1374
01:33:47,276 --> 01:33:48,616
[SPEAKER_01]: It had so much stuff going on.

1375
01:33:48,656 --> 01:33:55,460
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other one in the series was there was Sexy Proteus and Pyro Wars.

1376
01:33:56,240 --> 01:34:07,286
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also saw last night and if you can hear on the thing a lot of the levels remix Gradius music to start or Salamander music and then play classical music.

1377
01:34:08,867 --> 01:34:09,007
[SPEAKER_01]: Like

1378
01:34:10,541 --> 01:34:19,408
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, but, uh, last night I was looking at YouTube trying to find, you know, because we obviously play the sound off of YouTube that way.

1379
01:34:20,209 --> 01:34:26,894
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I found the Proteus, um, uh, Pachinko machine videos.

1380
01:34:27,215 --> 01:34:27,495
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.

1381
01:34:27,635 --> 01:34:34,280
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the, there's even like this little model show with, uh, the, uh, the bunny suit girls.

1382
01:34:34,441 --> 01:34:37,283
[SPEAKER_01]: It's girls in bunny outfits riding on missiles.

1383
01:34:38,760 --> 01:34:42,788
[SPEAKER_01]: and then the showgirl was one of them stomping through the city.

1384
01:34:45,228 --> 01:34:46,328
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just really cool.

1385
01:34:46,348 --> 01:34:50,770
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, so we at least still have the Proteus franchise still alive.

1386
01:34:50,950 --> 01:34:52,271
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to see a new Proteus.

1387
01:34:52,511 --> 01:34:52,991
[SPEAKER_01]: Really bad.

1388
01:34:53,011 --> 01:34:54,131
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

1389
01:34:54,332 --> 01:34:56,732
[SPEAKER_06]: Or some folks in chat are saying Proteus on Virtual Console.

1390
01:34:57,133 --> 01:35:01,734
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially with the fact that we do know they will put games that were once Japanese only.

1391
01:35:01,774 --> 01:35:02,855
[SPEAKER_06]: They have been releasing over here.

1392
01:35:02,915 --> 01:35:03,915
[SPEAKER_06]: Like Mario Bros.

1393
01:35:04,195 --> 01:35:05,076
[SPEAKER_06]: 2, the original.

1394
01:35:05,136 --> 01:35:08,737
[SPEAKER_01]: Looks like if they have a problem with the eagle one, then bring out Oshaberry Proteus.

1395
01:35:08,797 --> 01:35:09,857
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it was in there.

1396
01:35:09,917 --> 01:35:12,919
[SPEAKER_06]: I think everybody is smart enough to just get over it.

1397
01:35:13,179 --> 01:35:13,819
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, really.

1398
01:35:15,182 --> 01:35:15,682
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not a big deal.

1399
01:35:16,023 --> 01:35:21,327
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason why I like Oshinori Parodius is that one of the bad guys in it is actually supposed to be one of the girls from Tokimeki Memorial.

1400
01:35:22,608 --> 01:35:23,989
[SPEAKER_01]: The long-term dating sim.

1401
01:35:24,469 --> 01:35:24,769
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

1402
01:35:25,170 --> 01:35:25,430
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1403
01:35:25,710 --> 01:35:26,471
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there it is, folks.

1404
01:35:26,491 --> 01:35:28,652
[SPEAKER_06]: Your classic game of the year.

1405
01:35:29,453 --> 01:35:31,935
[SPEAKER_06]: Parodius Da, in this case, on the PC Engine.

1406
01:35:32,015 --> 01:35:34,837
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, it's out there for multiple systems.

1407
01:35:35,658 --> 01:35:36,858
[SPEAKER_06]: So, very good pick, Jamie.

1408
01:35:36,878 --> 01:35:38,119
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1409
01:35:38,199 --> 01:35:39,961
[SPEAKER_06]: This game always cracks me up every time I watch it.

1410
01:35:39,981 --> 01:35:41,342
[SPEAKER_06]: Because Gradius is an awesome game.

1411
01:35:41,362 --> 01:35:43,163
[SPEAKER_06]: And where was this game in the Gradius collection?

1412
01:35:43,423 --> 01:35:44,144
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I would like to know.

1413
01:35:44,426 --> 01:35:45,346
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, right?

1414
01:35:45,547 --> 01:35:50,669
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think there was another... I actually want to say that all of them have been released on Saturn.

1415
01:35:51,429 --> 01:35:52,549
[SPEAKER_01]: Except for the MSX one.

1416
01:35:53,750 --> 01:35:57,411
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, coming up in Part B on tonight's program, we're going to get into the mailbag.

1417
01:35:57,532 --> 01:36:02,234
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to get into the next six months of the year, from July to December, recapping the top stories.

1418
01:36:02,714 --> 01:36:09,997
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to talk about release dates, or lack thereof, and our top five best and worst games of the year, as well as our predictions for 2008.

1419
01:36:10,817 --> 01:36:12,798
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all coming up right after the break.

1420
01:36:13,639 --> 01:36:18,623
[SPEAKER_06]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week.

1421
01:36:19,083 --> 01:36:23,386
[SPEAKER_06]: Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
