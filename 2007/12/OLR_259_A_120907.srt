00:00:14,471 --> 00:00:19,175
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, December 9th, 2007, new details emerge on Street Fighter IV.

2
00:00:19,556 --> 00:00:24,100
[SPEAKER_00]: Nintendo gets a ninja party next year, and has GameTap started removing games?

3
00:00:32,441 --> 00:00:36,603
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:36,643 --> 00:00:47,109
[SPEAKER_03]: We are that gaming show, podcast, blogcast, Zoomcast, whatever you're into, thing dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

5
00:00:47,149 --> 00:00:48,149
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Rob Roberts.

6
00:00:48,529 --> 00:00:51,671
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome back to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

7
00:00:51,931 --> 00:00:52,231
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.

8
00:00:52,391 --> 00:00:53,032
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you doing, Jamie?

9
00:00:53,972 --> 00:00:55,173
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm almost full.

10
00:00:55,649 --> 00:00:56,389
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

11
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:22,460
[SPEAKER_03]: Good times.

12
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:35,262
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to Alabama with Sauce, and we stayed at my grandmom's house and ate a lot of Blue Bell ice cream and watched a bunch of movies and had Cracker Barrel and Waffle House.

13
00:01:36,243 --> 00:01:37,943
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds very Jamie.

14
00:01:37,963 --> 00:01:38,903
[SPEAKER_01]: It was very delicious.

15
00:01:39,083 --> 00:01:40,103
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a very Jamie experience.

16
00:01:40,123 --> 00:01:41,163
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a delicious time.

17
00:01:41,604 --> 00:01:41,964
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.

18
00:01:42,384 --> 00:01:44,184
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, say hello as well to Tech Master Loki.

19
00:01:44,724 --> 00:01:44,864
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.

20
00:01:44,964 --> 00:01:45,884
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you doing, Loki?

21
00:01:46,284 --> 00:01:46,464
[SPEAKER_03]: Fine.

22
00:01:46,945 --> 00:01:48,645
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you enjoying the new studio, by the way?

23
00:01:49,145 --> 00:01:49,345
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great.

24
00:01:49,798 --> 00:01:50,538
[SPEAKER_03]: It's big.

25
00:01:50,658 --> 00:01:51,998
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it's much more spacious than before.

26
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:54,839
[SPEAKER_03]: It even comes complete with a washer and dryer that you can't see on the camera.

27
00:01:57,019 --> 00:01:59,580
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, for when I piss myself with joy.

28
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,561
[SPEAKER_02]: I can just clean my clothes right there.

29
00:02:02,601 --> 00:02:03,201
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.

30
00:02:04,121 --> 00:02:10,722
[SPEAKER_03]: Or, you know, when we have the, as somebody said earlier, on the cam, we covered a ladder with one of the blankets there to make it look a little better.

31
00:02:11,302 --> 00:02:16,143
[SPEAKER_03]: And somebody said something about we could use the ladder in having ladder matches during the show.

32
00:02:16,323 --> 00:02:19,004
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was saying, oh, we have, you know, cage matches and

33
00:02:19,318 --> 00:02:22,739
[SPEAKER_03]: Bra and Panties matches, and Whipped Cream and Bananas matches.

34
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:27,501
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, say hello as well to the one and only Puppy is here tonight.

35
00:02:27,521 --> 00:02:29,081
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you doing, Puppy?

36
00:02:30,381 --> 00:02:34,923
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm worn out from school and work, but I'm getting by.

37
00:02:35,323 --> 00:02:39,024
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm playing lots of Rock Band, and my right leg is cramping.

38
00:02:39,064 --> 00:02:41,385
[SPEAKER_03]: Now hold on, don't spoil your gaming weeks just yet.

39
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:45,126
[SPEAKER_03]: See, you're angsty that your right leg is cramping so much.

40
00:02:46,929 --> 00:02:48,850
[SPEAKER_03]: All sorts of errors tonight in the brand new studio.

41
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:50,450
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you like our new digs?

42
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:52,691
[SPEAKER_04]: It's much more spacious than that previous box.

43
00:02:52,711 --> 00:02:54,472
[SPEAKER_03]: This is much more spacious than the previous box.

44
00:02:54,532 --> 00:02:57,093
[SPEAKER_03]: Although Loki still has the same table that wobbles.

45
00:02:57,293 --> 00:03:02,255
[SPEAKER_02]: I think as somebody said... I used to have the overturned laundry basket.

46
00:03:02,755 --> 00:03:04,056
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I have the wobbly table.

47
00:03:04,316 --> 00:03:05,136
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm moving up in life.

48
00:03:05,276 --> 00:03:06,697
[SPEAKER_03]: Independent radio at its finest.

49
00:03:06,997 --> 00:03:13,540
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody was saying earlier when I was doing the test earlier today and somebody was watching said all I need is a little mini bar back there and we would truly be an orange lounge.

50
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,240
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be fun.

51
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,501
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, why don't you start us off?

52
00:03:16,601 --> 00:03:17,201
[SPEAKER_02]: How was your gaming week?

53
00:03:17,221 --> 00:03:19,162
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I played a lot of Ragnarok now that I have internet again.

54
00:03:46,248 --> 00:03:46,728
[SPEAKER_01]: I missed it.

55
00:03:47,189 --> 00:03:50,850
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a character at level 97 now, and that was really awesome.

56
00:03:51,891 --> 00:04:00,094
[SPEAKER_01]: And while I was in Alabama, I didn't play crap, except on the airplane where I tried to play some Oendan, and totally irritated this guy sitting next to me.

57
00:04:00,134 --> 00:04:01,255
[SPEAKER_01]: It was fantastic.

58
00:04:02,135 --> 00:04:02,715
[SPEAKER_04]: That's great.

59
00:04:03,796 --> 00:04:06,617
[SPEAKER_04]: I did that when I still had it when I was in classes.

60
00:04:06,837 --> 00:04:10,719
[SPEAKER_04]: In between breaks, I'd start playing it, and people would look at me like, what the hell is that tapping noise you're doing?

61
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:17,946
[SPEAKER_01]: I had my headphones on, and he was just looking at me like, oh, but on the way back, this is cool.

62
00:04:18,907 --> 00:04:22,270
[SPEAKER_01]: When I got on the little dinky tiny plane, no, I take that back.

63
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:24,312
[SPEAKER_01]: It was when I got on the bigger plane coming out of Dallas.

64
00:04:25,653 --> 00:04:28,375
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys were sitting behind me like, oh, well, don't mind us.

65
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:31,558
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we're just about, you know, we're nerds, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

66
00:04:31,898 --> 00:04:33,760
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, okay.

67
00:04:34,261 --> 00:04:36,583
[SPEAKER_01]: And then for some reason, we started talking about Half-Life.

68
00:04:37,996 --> 00:04:44,619
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't play Half-Life, but I was like, yeah, I'm going to get Portal anyway, but I'm going to be so motion sick.

69
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,801
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, you get motion sick and you're on an airplane?

70
00:04:46,821 --> 00:04:50,262
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, only video games make me motion sick.

71
00:04:50,282 --> 00:04:53,084
[SPEAKER_01]: That and riding in the backseat of a car will do it sometimes.

72
00:04:53,744 --> 00:04:55,245
[SPEAKER_01]: Or riding in Kristen's car on Highway 1.

73
00:04:56,706 --> 00:04:59,067
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that was my gaming week.

74
00:04:59,727 --> 00:05:01,248
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a Black Knight pinball in our house now.

75
00:05:02,588 --> 00:05:03,249
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a Black Knight 2000.

76
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:07,571
[SPEAKER_01]: We are housing somebody's Black Knight.

77
00:05:07,947 --> 00:05:08,467
[SPEAKER_03]: What does that mean?

78
00:05:08,587 --> 00:05:09,408
[SPEAKER_03]: You're borrowing?

79
00:05:10,369 --> 00:05:11,590
[SPEAKER_01]: We're providing them storage space.

80
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:12,270
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

81
00:05:12,891 --> 00:05:15,212
[SPEAKER_01]: In exchange for massive amounts of playing it.

82
00:05:15,693 --> 00:05:16,033
[SPEAKER_03]: Alrighty.

83
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,755
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let's go over to the one and only Loki.

84
00:05:18,795 --> 00:05:19,776
[SPEAKER_03]: How was your gaming week, Loki?

85
00:05:21,917 --> 00:05:24,979
[SPEAKER_02]: Not as filled as I thought it would be, unfortunately.

86
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,701
[SPEAKER_02]: I planned to play a lot of things and never got around to it.

87
00:05:28,342 --> 00:05:32,625
[SPEAKER_02]: But I played more Zelda fandom, Hourglass, almost done with that.

88
00:05:33,942 --> 00:05:37,584
[SPEAKER_02]: See, the thing with Zelda games is, like, when you finish them, you don't want to play them again.

89
00:05:38,084 --> 00:05:38,965
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, you're done.

90
00:05:40,386 --> 00:05:42,327
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, um... I don't know about that.

91
00:05:42,387 --> 00:05:46,069
[SPEAKER_03]: I challenge that statement, because I can still go back and play the old Super Nintendo one.

92
00:05:46,289 --> 00:05:48,411
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think of the old school NES ones I still love, too.

93
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:50,372
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, true, like the Super Nintendo ones and stuff.

94
00:05:50,452 --> 00:05:51,973
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this game is a little bit shorter.

95
00:05:52,473 --> 00:05:57,176
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it seemed to be really short, versus, you know... Maybe you're just that good.

96
00:05:58,196 --> 00:05:59,677
[SPEAKER_02]: No, the game is really fucking easy.

97
00:05:59,757 --> 00:06:01,178
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, like, stupid easy.

98
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:02,379
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

99
00:06:03,621 --> 00:06:06,002
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, it's just, it's okay, I guess.

100
00:06:08,122 --> 00:06:10,623
[SPEAKER_02]: Saints Row, I actually went back and started playing the single player stuff.

101
00:06:11,503 --> 00:06:15,925
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really, now, I haven't really been playing the single player stuff.

102
00:06:16,005 --> 00:06:21,246
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been playing single player, but I've been blowing up this armored car over and over and over again.

103
00:06:21,466 --> 00:06:25,807
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there's a trick where you can keep getting more money, because I'm trying to get the achievement for a million dollars.

104
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:27,608
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I keep doing that.

105
00:06:28,066 --> 00:06:30,887
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's entertaining nonetheless because you're blowing up cars over and over.

106
00:06:31,087 --> 00:06:32,527
[SPEAKER_03]: Achievement whore.

107
00:06:33,147 --> 00:06:36,688
[SPEAKER_02]: But we've been switching up at work instead of all rocket matches now.

108
00:06:36,888 --> 00:06:42,669
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we're doing shotguns, pimp slap, and grenades in the meter made cars.

109
00:06:43,149 --> 00:06:45,269
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hilarious because those things... That sounds like a party.

110
00:06:45,609 --> 00:06:47,749
[SPEAKER_03]: Pimp slaps and grenades in the meter made cars.

111
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:48,750
[SPEAKER_03]: But you don't understand.

112
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:49,530
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like a band name.

113
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:51,810
[SPEAKER_02]: See, Saints Row, the pimp slap is like a one hit kill.

114
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:54,351
[SPEAKER_02]: You just smack somebody and it launches them across the entire arena.

115
00:06:54,391 --> 00:06:55,151
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually pretty fun.

116
00:06:56,151 --> 00:06:56,251
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

117
00:06:57,376 --> 00:06:59,077
[SPEAKER_02]: DanSenseRevolutionUniverse2 DanSenseRevolutionUniverse2

118
00:07:21,612 --> 00:07:24,694
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fucking DDR.

119
00:07:25,215 --> 00:07:27,676
[SPEAKER_02]: It's exactly the same as Universe 1 to me.

120
00:07:28,797 --> 00:07:30,038
[SPEAKER_02]: They've changed a few things.

121
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:35,782
[SPEAKER_02]: The quest mode, you're no longer moving around the United States and the world and stuff.

122
00:07:36,462 --> 00:07:39,605
[SPEAKER_02]: Now there's fictional DDR island shit.

123
00:07:40,305 --> 00:07:40,665
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

124
00:07:41,746 --> 00:07:45,969
[SPEAKER_03]: But is it broken still like the first quest mode was or did they actually kind of fix that?

125
00:07:46,818 --> 00:07:51,299
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say it's 80% broken still, instead of 100% broken as before.

126
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,500
[SPEAKER_02]: The song list is okay.

127
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:59,981
[SPEAKER_02]: I still hate the fact that I have to play through quest mode in order to unlock songs.

128
00:08:00,361 --> 00:08:01,482
[SPEAKER_02]: I find that very annoying.

129
00:08:04,102 --> 00:08:05,203
[SPEAKER_02]: But, I mean, it's okay.

130
00:08:05,243 --> 00:08:05,863
[SPEAKER_02]: It's DDR.

131
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:14,385
[SPEAKER_02]: Luckily, I didn't have to buy it, so that's good, because right now the only way they're selling it is with the dance pad, and you have to pay lots of money for that.

132
00:08:16,132 --> 00:08:20,593
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're interested in picking it up, it is coming out in January, game by itself.

133
00:08:21,814 --> 00:08:29,215
[SPEAKER_02]: And about the same time we'll be getting a DDR Disney Channel edition, which is probably going to be crap, but that's okay.

134
00:08:30,516 --> 00:08:33,116
[SPEAKER_03]: But high school musical songs to DDR too.

135
00:08:33,557 --> 00:08:35,837
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, yeah, lame.

136
00:08:37,418 --> 00:08:38,858
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, what else did I play this week?

137
00:08:41,481 --> 00:08:45,943
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's about it, because really I haven't had a chance to play a lot of stuff.

138
00:08:46,043 --> 00:08:50,506
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, I bought two games yesterday and I haven't even unwrapped them yet.

139
00:08:50,526 --> 00:08:57,389
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got Contra 4 and Final Fantasy XII Revenant Wings for when I finish Zelda, which will be very soon.

140
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:05,233
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, all the extra stuff in Zelda, like all the hidden islands and stuff, they have an island that looks like a DS, and I was like, oh, that's kind of funny.

141
00:09:06,855 --> 00:09:08,656
[SPEAKER_02]: That was about the extent of my interest in that.

142
00:09:08,996 --> 00:09:12,237
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's another island that you can find treasure.

143
00:09:12,297 --> 00:09:13,877
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, it's really kind of lame.

144
00:09:13,977 --> 00:09:23,560
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like Wind Waker was, where it kind of felt like Mega Man Legends to me a little bit, where there's a lot of exploring, a ton of different dungeons and stuff.

145
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:29,182
[SPEAKER_02]: This game, I don't know, it's just kind of really scaled down and made it a hell of a lot easier.

146
00:09:29,622 --> 00:09:33,703
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to go back and play Wind Waker again, because I never did finish that game.

147
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:40,472
[SPEAKER_02]: And then maybe eventually I'll warm up to playing Twilight Princess, but... I don't know, I just don't like it.

148
00:09:41,913 --> 00:09:42,633
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, fine.

149
00:09:43,654 --> 00:09:44,715
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, then my gaming week.

150
00:09:44,915 --> 00:09:48,917
[SPEAKER_03]: There was some new stuff I finally got to play this week, as opposed to the same old MMOs.

151
00:09:48,978 --> 00:09:51,059
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually didn't play the MMOs so much this week.

152
00:09:51,439 --> 00:09:56,302
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually checked out some new stuff, including the Orange Box, finally, which is magnificent.

153
00:09:56,883 --> 00:09:58,604
[SPEAKER_03]: There's several different games in there.

154
00:09:58,624 --> 00:10:02,246
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't even gotten to touch Team Fortress 2 yet, but I've been playing some of the other games in there.

155
00:10:02,626 --> 00:10:03,207
[SPEAKER_03]: Half-Life, which...

156
00:10:03,768 --> 00:10:12,504
[SPEAKER_03]: To be honest, I know it's a critically acclaimed game and everything, but I just never really got the chance to play it before, so this is really the first chance I'm getting to play Half-Life.

157
00:10:13,086 --> 00:10:14,007
[SPEAKER_03]: Half-Life 2, I mean, of course.

158
00:10:15,732 --> 00:10:16,292
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of cool.

159
00:10:16,332 --> 00:10:17,392
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very immersive.

160
00:10:17,432 --> 00:10:18,333
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, Portal.

161
00:10:18,353 --> 00:10:20,373
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been playing a lot of Portal.

162
00:10:21,433 --> 00:10:28,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving through the game rather quickly, I guess the game really isn't that long, per se, but be damned if it isn't pretty funny and pretty innovative.

163
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:33,735
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a great kind of, like, it's a puzzle game in first person.

164
00:10:34,176 --> 00:10:36,636
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, it's not a first person shooter, it's a first person puzzler.

165
00:10:36,716 --> 00:10:37,816
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what else to call it.

166
00:10:37,856 --> 00:10:38,436
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty cool.

167
00:10:39,196 --> 00:10:41,377
[SPEAKER_03]: I swear to God, though, that whole thing where you have to, like...

168
00:10:42,097 --> 00:10:48,879
[SPEAKER_03]: Fire a portal on the ground, and then fire the other half up on the ceiling, and then fall from the ceiling to the one on the ground to get enough inertia.

169
00:10:49,119 --> 00:10:53,600
[SPEAKER_03]: That thing drove me frickin' nuts for like, I was trying to do that for like an hour.

170
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:56,200
[SPEAKER_03]: It was so difficult, but I finally got through that.

171
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:07,743
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, also, the other game I've been playing is Geometry Wars Galaxies I picked up on the Nintendo Wii, and I'm having quite a bit of fun with Geometry Wars Galaxies.

172
00:11:07,803 --> 00:11:08,743
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a pretty good time.

173
00:11:11,027 --> 00:11:14,249
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a lot different than just the game on the Xbox.

174
00:11:41,496 --> 00:11:43,077
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually kind of enjoyed the control scheme.

175
00:11:43,217 --> 00:11:49,059
[SPEAKER_02]: And plus, if for whatever reason you don't like that control scheme, you can do the classic controller, which is great.

176
00:11:49,559 --> 00:12:01,863
[SPEAKER_03]: Classic controller doesn't feel quite as nice as the Xbox 360 controller did, and I think it's because the directionals are a little more grooved on the Wii, whereas the Xbox 360 has the full 360 degrees of movement a little bit.

177
00:12:02,143 --> 00:12:05,764
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that it doesn't have quite the same feel with the classic controller, but it's nice.

178
00:12:06,364 --> 00:12:10,547
[SPEAKER_03]: My only minor complaints about the game is that, A, it looks better on the 360, obviously.

179
00:12:10,587 --> 00:12:15,970
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you can tell there's some graphical dumbing down that had to be done for the Wii.

180
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:17,350
[SPEAKER_03]: But it doesn't look bad.

181
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:18,871
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it is Geometry Wars.

182
00:12:18,891 --> 00:12:24,554
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not going to expect, you know, the world's best looking game, you know, when you're looking at that.

183
00:12:26,385 --> 00:12:42,628
[SPEAKER_03]: and then also the other only kind of minor complaint I have is that it's kind of cool that you progress through these different levels and you unlock new planets and you unlock new power-ups because the other kind of thing that you have in Geometry Wars Galaxy is you have a little droid that follows you and you can tell the droid what to do.

184
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:50,130
[SPEAKER_03]: You can buy an attack mode or buy a defend and as you play more levels, the droid levels up with you.

185
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:52,470
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of cool, so it gets a little smarter.

186
00:12:52,911 --> 00:12:54,631
[SPEAKER_03]: But the only thing is that there's really no...

187
00:12:55,707 --> 00:12:56,407
[SPEAKER_03]: and so on.

188
00:13:23,024 --> 00:13:25,306
[SPEAKER_03]: That was my only minor complaint, but overall, I think the game's great.

189
00:13:25,326 --> 00:13:26,948
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't need cutscenes in Geometry Wars?

190
00:13:27,068 --> 00:13:33,535
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't mean, like, you have to, like, have these grand, like, cutscenes, but, like, give me a reason for kind of, like, unlocking all these things.

191
00:13:33,575 --> 00:13:36,177
[SPEAKER_03]: Or, you know, just a little bit of a story wouldn't hurt.

192
00:13:36,598 --> 00:13:37,078
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?

193
00:13:37,378 --> 00:13:45,987
[SPEAKER_02]: What they need to do is take Geometry Wars out of, like, just the normal, like, asteroid kind of stuff and make it into, like, a shoot-'em-up game.

194
00:13:46,601 --> 00:13:48,401
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Grideus or something like that.

195
00:13:48,801 --> 00:13:49,642
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be fun.

196
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:50,482
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it might be fun.

197
00:13:51,522 --> 00:13:59,683
[SPEAKER_03]: The other cool thing about Geometry Wars I thought was really cool is that you can download the demo of... Well, it's not really the demo of Galaxies to your DS.

198
00:13:59,723 --> 00:14:01,064
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just basically retro evolved.

199
00:14:01,104 --> 00:14:04,104
[SPEAKER_03]: You can download to your DS from the Wii, which is kind of cool.

200
00:14:05,124 --> 00:14:07,545
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do not like the way the DS controls at all.

201
00:14:07,965 --> 00:14:09,505
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't really want the game on DS.

202
00:14:09,525 --> 00:14:13,446
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you use the stylus on the bottom to control your firing and it just...

203
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:14,687
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

204
00:14:40,942 --> 00:14:42,984
[SPEAKER_04]: A ton, ever since I got it.

205
00:14:43,104 --> 00:14:54,916
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to switch back to my Guitar Hero 3 controller because the strum bar on my Rock Band controller died, and I sent out for the warranty on that, and it actually came back already.

206
00:14:55,536 --> 00:14:58,519
[SPEAKER_04]: It only took three days for me to get the replacement, and I sent the other one back.

207
00:14:59,560 --> 00:14:59,840
[SPEAKER_04]: And then...

208
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:04,641
[SPEAKER_04]: Other than that, I got Gamefly, so I've been renting games lately.

209
00:15:05,921 --> 00:15:16,645
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to rent Mass Effect, Call of Duty 4, Orange Box, and I guess I put Dead Rising on my list a long time ago and forgot about it.

210
00:15:17,225 --> 00:15:18,966
[SPEAKER_04]: And they ended up sending me that instead.

211
00:15:19,646 --> 00:15:23,688
[SPEAKER_04]: I played it for a total of an hour and a half and sent it back.

212
00:15:24,668 --> 00:15:27,189
[SPEAKER_04]: I could not stand that game for some reason.

213
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:28,970
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just terrible.

214
00:15:29,582 --> 00:15:33,983
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was great because you could hit zombies with a scythe or a lawnmower.

215
00:15:35,064 --> 00:15:47,347
[SPEAKER_04]: Well that was entertaining but the story could have been cooler but the way they've got the game set up you can only save it once and if you die you have to go back very far and reload a bunch of crap.

216
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:51,929
[SPEAKER_04]: I just got sick of it very quickly and I would not have played through the entire game.

217
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:55,910
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that it?

218
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:56,930
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

219
00:15:58,601 --> 00:16:03,198
[SPEAKER_04]: Rock Band, Dead Rising, not playing Halo again until the maps come out next week.

220
00:16:04,591 --> 00:16:05,511
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's pretty much it.

221
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,539
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just have to get something to split that signal.

222
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:37,260
[SPEAKER_03]: So, but, yeah, Jamie and Loki's computers run fine on the wireless network.

223
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:37,800
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what that is.

224
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,861
[SPEAKER_03]: But then again, they're not trying to broadcast a radio program from that.

225
00:16:40,181 --> 00:16:43,281
[SPEAKER_03]: So I apologize, chat room, if Live365's going up and down.

226
00:16:43,381 --> 00:16:46,082
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll just kind of have to deal with it tonight and then next week we'll fix that.

227
00:16:46,102 --> 00:16:46,622
[SPEAKER_03]: But now we know.

228
00:16:47,362 --> 00:16:53,284
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is weird because I ran Live365 and Op11 at the same time for 40 minutes earlier today and everything was fine.

229
00:16:53,784 --> 00:16:55,584
[SPEAKER_03]: But now, of course, we're having a plethora of problems.

230
00:16:55,704 --> 00:16:56,244
[SPEAKER_03]: Just my luck.

231
00:16:56,624 --> 00:16:58,685
[SPEAKER_04]: And people will continuously bitch about it.

232
00:16:58,705 --> 00:16:58,725
[SPEAKER_04]: I...

233
00:17:01,158 --> 00:17:01,979
[SPEAKER_01]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

234
00:17:30,464 --> 00:17:34,846
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, I was going to say, I was going to talk about one more thing that I played this week.

235
00:17:35,066 --> 00:17:35,546
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, alright.

236
00:17:36,766 --> 00:17:51,012
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not sure, I can't remember if we're getting into this later on or not, but anyways, there's like an independent games festival thing kind of going on right now that they've got some of the finalists for.

237
00:17:51,636 --> 00:17:53,376
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the awards come up later in our show.

238
00:17:53,396 --> 00:17:53,897
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the awards.

239
00:17:54,397 --> 00:17:56,897
[SPEAKER_02]: The 10th Annual Independent Games Festival.

240
00:17:56,937 --> 00:18:00,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, I was playing some of the finalists for that.

241
00:18:00,838 --> 00:18:06,720
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the games they played, Clean Asia, which, you know, I'm a huge fan of Warning Forever and stuff like that.

242
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,900
[SPEAKER_02]: Very similar style game.

243
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:09,800
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool shoot-em-up.

244
00:18:09,821 --> 00:18:10,521
[SPEAKER_02]: You gotta try that.

245
00:18:10,861 --> 00:18:13,701
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, Cran Physics is another funny one.

246
00:18:14,042 --> 00:18:17,782
[SPEAKER_02]: But they've got some other stuff in there as well, including a game that I talked about before.

247
00:18:17,802 --> 00:18:19,503
[SPEAKER_02]: What was it?

248
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:19,803
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh,

249
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:21,501
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see here.

250
00:18:22,081 --> 00:18:28,044
[SPEAKER_02]: Fret Nice was another one of the nominees, which is a pretty fun game to play on the PC with the Guitar Hero controller.

251
00:18:28,905 --> 00:18:29,905
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

252
00:18:30,065 --> 00:18:32,207
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, tell us more about that when we get to that part of the show.

253
00:18:32,267 --> 00:18:32,787
[SPEAKER_03]: Will do.

254
00:18:33,067 --> 00:18:33,367
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

255
00:18:33,648 --> 00:18:35,288
[SPEAKER_01]: Rob, I have a question about your gaming week.

256
00:18:35,569 --> 00:18:35,789
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

257
00:18:36,249 --> 00:18:38,370
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you make it past that part in Portal?

258
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:39,411
[SPEAKER_03]: I sure did.

259
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:40,792
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to the next level in Portal.

260
00:18:40,852 --> 00:18:45,915
[SPEAKER_03]: I was venting with Jamie my frustration at the robots that shoot you a bunch and then you die.

261
00:18:46,235 --> 00:18:47,836
[SPEAKER_03]: I was having a hard time getting through that portion.

262
00:18:48,196 --> 00:18:49,897
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Jamie said, you have to shoot the ceiling.

263
00:18:50,641 --> 00:18:51,202
[SPEAKER_03]: I felt bad for Rob

264
00:19:18,888 --> 00:19:21,849
[SPEAKER_01]: I watched the walkthrough like a bajillion times just because I thought it was funny.

265
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:24,469
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I had to help.

266
00:19:25,109 --> 00:19:25,529
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

267
00:19:25,589 --> 00:19:32,050
[SPEAKER_03]: So now I'm to the next stage in Portal and I just kind of quit for the night because I wanted to play some other stuff so I had new things to talk about tonight.

268
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:34,531
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, a little bit of housekeeping.

269
00:19:35,071 --> 00:19:41,812
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess I already talked about kind of the parts about the new studio and unfortunately the effect it's having on us tonight with the whole live stream cutting in and out.

270
00:19:41,852 --> 00:19:42,312
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry about that.

271
00:19:43,852 --> 00:19:46,153
[SPEAKER_03]: But we'll hopefully fix that within the next couple weeks.

272
00:19:48,365 --> 00:19:50,066
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we doing a show December 23rd?

273
00:19:50,406 --> 00:19:51,506
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think we talked about that.

274
00:19:51,926 --> 00:19:53,166
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the Christmas week.

275
00:19:54,087 --> 00:19:55,327
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be here for Christmas.

276
00:19:56,387 --> 00:19:57,808
[SPEAKER_01]: I should be available.

277
00:19:58,088 --> 00:19:59,108
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think I'll probably be here too.

278
00:19:59,128 --> 00:19:59,908
[SPEAKER_01]: But I have to work Monday.

279
00:20:00,608 --> 00:20:02,409
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course we have our year-end show coming.

280
00:20:02,429 --> 00:20:03,369
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to work on Christmas Eve?

281
00:20:03,889 --> 00:20:04,430
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

282
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:04,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry about that.

283
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:09,411
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I work for, you know, freaking tyrants, so it's okay.

284
00:20:10,446 --> 00:20:20,915
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be having our year-end special probably on December 30th, and I'm hoping that we get some guests on the program like we did last year, but more on that in the next couple weeks.

285
00:20:21,255 --> 00:20:22,436
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get to the gaming news.

286
00:20:22,676 --> 00:20:23,897
[SPEAKER_03]: Enough about the housekeeping stuff.

287
00:20:23,937 --> 00:20:25,358
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's start off Loki tonight.

288
00:20:25,699 --> 00:20:28,181
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, I just wanted to comment one thing on the chat room.

289
00:20:28,221 --> 00:20:30,643
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone's talking about the weighted companion cube and stuff.

290
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:35,867
[SPEAKER_02]: No one ever mentions the weighted companion sphere that happens to be in challenge mode of the game.

291
00:20:36,661 --> 00:20:38,021
[SPEAKER_02]: No love for the sphere, I guess.

292
00:20:38,601 --> 00:20:40,162
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the difference between the sphere and the cube?

293
00:20:40,922 --> 00:20:42,422
[SPEAKER_02]: One's round and one's cube.

294
00:20:43,402 --> 00:20:46,243
[SPEAKER_01]: Does the computer call it the weighted companion sphere?

295
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:47,083
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

296
00:20:47,483 --> 00:20:54,645
[SPEAKER_02]: I think all that stuff's still the same, but it's just harder because you can't just drop it and it will roll.

297
00:20:54,765 --> 00:20:58,406
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's right, and you can't jump on top of it as easy because it'll roll.

298
00:20:58,486 --> 00:20:59,086
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I get it.

299
00:20:59,566 --> 00:21:01,746
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, duh, I know one's a sphere and a cube, dumbass.

300
00:21:01,807 --> 00:21:03,707
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, what is the effect that that has?

301
00:21:04,227 --> 00:21:04,847
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I get it.

302
00:21:05,067 --> 00:21:07,688
[SPEAKER_02]: And no, the sphere does not have any hearts on it.

303
00:21:08,288 --> 00:21:09,509
[SPEAKER_02]: Aw, sadness.

304
00:21:09,949 --> 00:21:11,309
[SPEAKER_01]: So it doesn't really like you.

305
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:12,590
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just pretending.

306
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:14,891
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, then we'll throw that thing in the incinerator like that.

307
00:21:15,911 --> 00:21:22,973
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, this week, Rockstar happened to throw out on the internet a brand new trailer for Grand Theft Auto 4.

308
00:21:23,474 --> 00:21:24,874
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fucking fantastic.

309
00:21:24,974 --> 00:21:26,035
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called Move Up, Ladies.

310
00:21:26,115 --> 00:21:33,077
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically what's really important about this trailer, though, compared to the last one, which came out about six months ago.

311
00:21:33,777 --> 00:21:36,698
[SPEAKER_02]: is it looks a lot better than, you know, the game has really progressed.

312
00:21:36,838 --> 00:21:46,021
[SPEAKER_02]: But it did show kind of a lot of the detail that they're adding there, including, you know, gunfights and all the stuff that you expect from Grand Theft Auto.

313
00:21:46,061 --> 00:21:47,701
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's a bunch of new screenshots and stuff.

314
00:21:47,862 --> 00:21:50,502
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to say the game is coming along very well.

315
00:21:50,942 --> 00:21:51,903
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks awesome.

316
00:21:52,123 --> 00:21:58,505
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think a lot of people that were kind of hesitating about the game before saying, oh, this is just going to be crap, are really on board with it.

317
00:21:58,625 --> 00:21:58,765
[SPEAKER_02]: But

318
00:21:59,565 --> 00:22:01,706
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to check it out, it's pretty much everywhere.

319
00:22:01,766 --> 00:22:04,546
[SPEAKER_02]: All the major sites, Xbox Live, PlayStation Network.

320
00:22:05,527 --> 00:22:06,787
[SPEAKER_02]: You can definitely find it at the download.

321
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:09,928
[SPEAKER_03]: Alrighty.

322
00:22:10,268 --> 00:22:13,809
[SPEAKER_03]: So, does it actually show more than just the cutscenes?

323
00:22:13,829 --> 00:22:16,970
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you actually see what the game is?

324
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:19,210
[SPEAKER_02]: All the cutscenes are with the in-game engine.

325
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:22,491
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, you essentially see what the game looks like.

326
00:22:23,471 --> 00:22:25,332
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the characters that they showed also was...

327
00:22:26,801 --> 00:22:28,242
[SPEAKER_02]: I just can't wait for the game to come out.

328
00:22:28,322 --> 00:22:31,525
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope it comes out actually in April, like it's supposed to.

329
00:22:47,216 --> 00:22:48,777
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought they discontinued the AIBO.

330
00:23:08,729 --> 00:23:10,171
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

331
00:23:30,331 --> 00:23:33,594
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it does in Sony's home, which should be kind of interesting.

332
00:23:34,075 --> 00:23:42,663
[SPEAKER_03]: So apparently you're going to be able to download new personalities for the AIBO from PlayStation Network and you're going to be able to use the PSP with it over Wi-Fi.

333
00:23:43,203 --> 00:23:48,148
[SPEAKER_03]: The little camera in the dog's head will actually also show on your PSP screen.

334
00:23:48,628 --> 00:23:55,815
[SPEAKER_03]: So what you could actually do is you could move your dog around and put it right under Lady's skirts and then use the PSP as an upskirt cam.

335
00:23:56,684 --> 00:23:56,964
[SPEAKER_03]: Sweet.

336
00:23:57,004 --> 00:23:59,365
[SPEAKER_03]: So when girls go, oh, what a cute fake doggy.

337
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:02,826
[SPEAKER_04]: That's probably the reasoning why they put it in Stuff Magazine to begin with.

338
00:24:03,406 --> 00:24:04,207
[SPEAKER_02]: Possibly.

339
00:24:04,567 --> 00:24:05,227
[SPEAKER_02]: Possibly.

340
00:24:05,607 --> 00:24:07,228
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to get one so I can play with my cat.

341
00:24:08,028 --> 00:24:10,549
[SPEAKER_02]: Because my cat's kind of getting lonely and she's causing a lot of trouble.

342
00:24:10,569 --> 00:24:16,351
[SPEAKER_02]: And I figured this would be a perfect way to spend a couple thousand dollars is to get a thing to play with my cat.

343
00:24:16,411 --> 00:24:19,292
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I could also watch it at work and watch what my cat's doing.

344
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:24,733
[SPEAKER_03]: Now here's my favorite part is that Stuff Magazine rates this rumor at a 53% possibility.

345
00:24:28,035 --> 00:24:29,776
[SPEAKER_03]: Where the fuck do you get a number like that?

346
00:24:29,876 --> 00:24:38,923
[SPEAKER_03]: Like 53, like it makes it sound like there's this real scientific process that rumors go through over at Stuff Magazine in order to get a rating.

347
00:24:39,003 --> 00:24:41,585
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like, you know, they put it in their big super predicting computer.

348
00:24:43,026 --> 00:24:43,646
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's a little note.

349
00:24:44,707 --> 00:24:47,769
[SPEAKER_03]: This has a 53% probability of being true.

350
00:24:47,789 --> 00:24:52,713
[SPEAKER_02]: This is about as official as the If They Mated segment of Conan.

351
00:24:52,933 --> 00:24:53,213
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

352
00:24:54,406 --> 00:24:54,826
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

353
00:24:54,926 --> 00:24:55,246
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

354
00:24:55,346 --> 00:24:56,707
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of call BS.

355
00:24:57,107 --> 00:25:00,728
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there may be like a little something with the AIBO, but I don't know.

356
00:25:00,848 --> 00:25:01,529
[SPEAKER_03]: Upskirt cams?

357
00:25:01,589 --> 00:25:02,169
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know about that.

358
00:25:02,509 --> 00:25:04,249
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't need to be giving Sony any ideas.

359
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:05,550
[SPEAKER_01]: I want an AIBO, Rob.

360
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:06,690
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

361
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:09,071
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, save up your money and then you can buy one.

362
00:25:09,231 --> 00:25:11,052
[SPEAKER_01]: I've wanted an AIBO for a very long time.

363
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:12,813
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a LiveJournal icon that's an AIBO.

364
00:25:13,033 --> 00:25:13,593
[SPEAKER_03]: I want a pony.

365
00:25:14,553 --> 00:25:15,073
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?

366
00:25:15,293 --> 00:25:15,373
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

367
00:25:15,393 --> 00:25:18,274
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd be more likely to get a pony than I'd be to get an AIBO.

368
00:25:18,294 --> 00:25:18,895
[SPEAKER_03]: AIBO judgment.

369
00:25:21,731 --> 00:25:22,852
[SPEAKER_01]: They should make the eye pony.

370
00:25:23,173 --> 00:25:27,456
[SPEAKER_01]: I was watching a special on robotics last night and they were bringing up the eye bow.

371
00:25:27,876 --> 00:25:35,943
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was these lifelike robot people thing that could interview people and repeat back your question and follow you and do all this stuff.

372
00:25:35,983 --> 00:25:38,705
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, yet the eye bow didn't sell better.

373
00:25:39,906 --> 00:25:40,707
[SPEAKER_02]: Eye paparazzi?

374
00:25:42,528 --> 00:25:45,110
[SPEAKER_01]: It was called like the respond cue or something.

375
00:25:45,151 --> 00:25:45,731
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really weird.

376
00:25:46,271 --> 00:25:48,373
[SPEAKER_01]: It was at one of the Tokyo robotics shows I was watching.

377
00:25:49,094 --> 00:25:49,294
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway.

378
00:25:49,314 --> 00:25:49,394
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

379
00:25:50,350 --> 00:26:01,079
[SPEAKER_01]: For anyone who is interested in Devil May Cry 4, which I know I am because I really, really, really, really, really, really like Devil May Cry, except why the hell are they giving Dante a beard?

380
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:09,425
[SPEAKER_01]: The demo is going to be out in early 2008, according to Capcom, for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

381
00:26:09,926 --> 00:26:13,308
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be a PC version, but no word on if we're getting a demo of that.

382
00:26:13,589 --> 00:26:18,833
[SPEAKER_01]: The demo is supposed to be different levels in the game instead of just, oh, here's the start of the game, bye.

383
00:26:20,037 --> 00:26:20,657
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

384
00:26:45,489 --> 00:26:46,870
[SPEAKER_01]: We've secretly replaced Shermie with an eyeball.

385
00:27:15,478 --> 00:27:20,180
[SPEAKER_02]: My cat's so retarded, she still thinks that the mirror is another cat, so, you know.

386
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:31,145
[SPEAKER_01]: I was watching on YouTube last night, though, along with the robotic stuff, I was also watching cats talking to people, you know, that could imitate human talk, and Shermie was going crazy.

387
00:27:31,845 --> 00:27:33,646
[SPEAKER_01]: She was running into the desk.

388
00:27:33,666 --> 00:27:35,246
[SPEAKER_01]: She's like, it's unnatural!

389
00:27:36,227 --> 00:27:41,489
[SPEAKER_01]: And then she legitimately... What in God's name is going on over there?

390
00:27:41,789 --> 00:27:42,990
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it sounded like, actually.

391
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:43,270
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

392
00:27:44,048 --> 00:27:44,909
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't understand.

393
00:27:45,029 --> 00:27:46,510
[SPEAKER_02]: We're kind of crazy with our cat.

394
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:52,254
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll make her talk, and we'll have conversations with her, but she can't talk.

395
00:27:52,434 --> 00:27:53,915
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know why the hell we do that.

396
00:27:55,997 --> 00:27:57,818
[SPEAKER_02]: And she has a really high-pitched voice somehow.

397
00:27:58,038 --> 00:27:58,419
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

398
00:27:58,439 --> 00:27:59,079
[SPEAKER_02]: It's weird.

399
00:27:59,259 --> 00:28:06,385
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the videos I was watching last night, it just sounded like the cat was actually just saying, Hello!

400
00:28:06,745 --> 00:28:07,405
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello!

401
00:28:07,445 --> 00:28:07,926
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that.

402
00:28:08,006 --> 00:28:09,767
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, okay.

403
00:28:10,428 --> 00:28:12,269
[SPEAKER_01]: And then another one was a cat sleeping in a sink.

404
00:28:14,335 --> 00:28:16,376
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this where Lolcats is going in 2008?

405
00:28:16,416 --> 00:28:17,577
[SPEAKER_03]: I think so.

406
00:28:18,357 --> 00:28:18,597
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

407
00:28:19,438 --> 00:28:21,219
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, let's move on.

408
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:33,446
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, so yes, one of the unfortunate things with the PlayStation 3 version of Rockbin was that you couldn't use your Guitar Hero 3 controller with it.

409
00:28:34,146 --> 00:28:42,150
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, now that's going to be fixed, and there is going to be a patch that's going to be coming where you'll be able to download it, and it will allow it to play.

410
00:28:42,431 --> 00:28:43,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Hooray!

411
00:28:43,111 --> 00:28:43,231
[SPEAKER_02]: Hooray!

412
00:28:44,073 --> 00:28:47,857
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of funny, though, is they had another story that came out earlier this week.

413
00:28:49,078 --> 00:29:01,030
[SPEAKER_02]: Some guy, RedOctane, was actually making fun of Rock Band and their guitar controllers and saying how they're never going to make those controllers compatible with Guitar Hero 3 because they think their controllers are crap.

414
00:29:02,471 --> 00:29:04,694
[SPEAKER_02]: Way to take the high road, RedOctane.

415
00:29:04,734 --> 00:29:05,735
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, it doesn't matter that our...

416
00:29:07,697 --> 00:29:12,479
[SPEAKER_02]: and Sumers or anything might want it a little bit easier so they don't have to buy more of your crappy controllers.

417
00:29:12,939 --> 00:29:15,420
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, let's just go ahead and, like, piss on them.

418
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:17,080
[SPEAKER_02]: Hooray.

419
00:29:19,521 --> 00:29:26,404
[SPEAKER_03]: I do like, though, that they're at least patching to, you know, at least somebody's giving in a little bit and patching so the guitars work universally.

420
00:29:26,464 --> 00:29:27,104
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know.

421
00:29:27,124 --> 00:29:28,044
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly, they should.

422
00:29:28,124 --> 00:29:30,285
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't understand why they lock it out of other games.

423
00:29:30,365 --> 00:29:31,405
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just fucking lazy.

424
00:29:31,805 --> 00:29:33,386
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, it's just fucking mean is what it is.

425
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:39,621
[SPEAKER_03]: Jonathan F. in our chat room has a good point that I don't believe we're covering elsewhere on our show tonight.

426
00:29:39,721 --> 00:29:45,883
[SPEAKER_03]: He says, speaking of patches, Guitar Hero Wii discs will be replaced in 2008 to fix the mono sound problem.

427
00:29:45,903 --> 00:29:46,503
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you hear about that?

428
00:29:47,363 --> 00:29:48,223
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

429
00:29:48,324 --> 00:29:52,345
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're going to remaster the discs or whatever, and they'll be available in 2008, new discs.

430
00:29:52,645 --> 00:29:54,345
[SPEAKER_03]: But how many people do you think will actually do that?

431
00:29:54,425 --> 00:29:57,026
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet most Wii owners probably wouldn't even think to do it.

432
00:29:58,126 --> 00:29:58,866
[SPEAKER_03]: There might be a few.

433
00:29:59,286 --> 00:30:00,627
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we need to spread the word.

434
00:30:00,707 --> 00:30:01,927
[SPEAKER_02]: Make it financially...

435
00:30:02,668 --> 00:30:03,328
[SPEAKER_02]: Sucky for them.

436
00:30:03,348 --> 00:30:03,989
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there you have it.

437
00:30:04,029 --> 00:30:11,111
[SPEAKER_03]: If you own Guitar Hero on the Wii, then be sure in 2008 you request your... And even if you don't care, just get a new one anyway.

438
00:30:11,151 --> 00:30:12,972
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just because newer is better.

439
00:30:13,372 --> 00:30:14,553
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what you need to remember.

440
00:30:14,693 --> 00:30:15,473
[SPEAKER_02]: Newer is better.

441
00:30:15,533 --> 00:30:16,073
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

442
00:30:16,233 --> 00:30:16,993
[SPEAKER_03]: Newer is better.

443
00:30:17,714 --> 00:30:20,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on, we're talking about the PlayStation a little bit.

444
00:30:20,755 --> 00:30:26,057
[SPEAKER_03]: And on the PlayStation Network, it has been released this week a brand new bowling game.

445
00:30:26,177 --> 00:30:27,597
[SPEAKER_03]: High Velocity Bowling is $10.

446
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:37,223
[SPEAKER_03]: Also added to the PlayStation Network, some new stuff for the game Folklore, and of course, Rock Band downloadable content.

447
00:30:38,083 --> 00:30:44,325
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, Wild Arms is now available for download on the old school PlayStation Games line.

448
00:30:44,786 --> 00:30:45,366
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay!

449
00:30:46,706 --> 00:30:51,208
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I don't know, it's certainly not Wii Bowling, but it kind of looks, you know...

450
00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:53,651
[SPEAKER_03]: Looks a little urban.

451
00:30:53,871 --> 00:30:55,532
[SPEAKER_02]: You play a guy with tattoos.

452
00:30:55,792 --> 00:30:57,794
[SPEAKER_02]: You actually use a 6-axis controller.

453
00:30:57,814 --> 00:30:59,255
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was kind of curious about that.

454
00:30:59,815 --> 00:31:12,523
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're going to have people throw... See, though, I don't know this one would be making holes in TVs and stuff, because it's kind of rounded and a little bit light, whereas when you kind of huck the remote, it's kind of like a javelin type thing.

455
00:31:12,563 --> 00:31:13,704
[SPEAKER_02]: Just get the nerf thing for it.

456
00:31:14,064 --> 00:31:14,545
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what you do.

457
00:31:15,285 --> 00:31:16,446
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, just get the nerf thing for it.

458
00:31:17,627 --> 00:31:17,847
[SPEAKER_01]: Well...

459
00:31:18,982 --> 00:31:25,787
[SPEAKER_01]: And other news for our PlayStation 3 owners, which at Best Buy, that was freaking sad.

460
00:31:26,347 --> 00:31:26,647
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yes.

461
00:31:26,688 --> 00:31:30,510
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie and I went to Best Buy earlier this week, and we were shopping.

462
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:32,251
[SPEAKER_03]: We were just kind of going around.

463
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:32,912
[SPEAKER_01]: Sad.

464
00:31:33,072 --> 00:31:35,594
[SPEAKER_03]: That's when I bought Geometry Wars Galaxies.

465
00:31:35,614 --> 00:31:35,774
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

466
00:31:36,054 --> 00:31:39,477
[SPEAKER_03]: I was thinking about getting Trauma Center, and I ended up getting the cheaper games.

467
00:31:39,497 --> 00:31:42,098
[SPEAKER_01]: And I bought Super Breakout for the Atari 5200 that night.

468
00:31:42,138 --> 00:31:42,719
[SPEAKER_03]: But that was later.

469
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:44,280
[SPEAKER_01]: But I already owned two copies of it.

470
00:31:45,548 --> 00:31:46,950
[SPEAKER_03]: Why did you buy a third, dummy?

471
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:54,156
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought that we didn't have it, and then it occurred to me when we got home that freaking Super Breakout was the game that came with the Atari 5200.

472
00:31:54,196 --> 00:31:59,681
[SPEAKER_01]: But I have a manual now, and that's good.

473
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:00,408
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

474
00:32:01,429 --> 00:32:07,913
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, anyhow, as I say, at Best Buy, we were there, and, you know, there were big stacks of PlayStation 3s, like, all over the store.

475
00:32:08,253 --> 00:32:11,736
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, not just one stack, but, like, at least four stacks of PlayStation 3s.

476
00:32:12,016 --> 00:32:16,559
[SPEAKER_01]: There were easily, what, 50 systems just sitting out, unloved?

477
00:32:16,899 --> 00:32:22,543
[SPEAKER_03]: And we were kind of, you know, we were talking to the guy, because the guy was helping me look up Geometry Wars Galaxies, because for whatever reason, they didn't have any out on the floor.

478
00:32:22,583 --> 00:32:23,424
[SPEAKER_03]: They were all in the cage.

479
00:32:23,744 --> 00:32:25,225
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was asking him if they had it and everything.

480
00:32:25,492 --> 00:32:26,212
[SPEAKER_03]: Metal Gear Solid 4 Geriatric Snake

481
00:32:55,236 --> 00:32:55,596
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

482
00:32:55,976 --> 00:32:56,336
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway.

483
00:32:58,097 --> 00:32:59,798
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody likes a geriatric snake.

484
00:32:59,958 --> 00:33:04,960
[SPEAKER_03]: Or GZDr4F says Unreal Tournament 3 will sell the PlayStation 3 units.

485
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:05,720
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it won't.

486
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:06,400
[SPEAKER_03]: It will sell some.

487
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:07,140
[SPEAKER_03]: It will sell some.

488
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,581
[SPEAKER_03]: There's fanboys for everything.

489
00:33:09,661 --> 00:33:13,102
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, maybe when they put out Jumping Flash 3.

490
00:33:13,743 --> 00:33:14,203
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway.

491
00:33:14,223 --> 00:33:17,364
[SPEAKER_01]: For the 2.0 PS3 firmware update...

492
00:33:21,008 --> 00:33:28,994
[SPEAKER_01]: There is... It was actually included that there were custom soundtracks for High Velocity Bowling.

493
00:33:30,395 --> 00:33:31,957
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, who's playing High Velocity Bowling?

494
00:33:33,838 --> 00:33:35,719
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I don't know whoever downloaded it this week.

495
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:36,880
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows?

496
00:33:37,101 --> 00:33:40,903
[SPEAKER_01]: But it also has an in-game friends list for the demo for Time Shift.

497
00:33:41,424 --> 00:33:47,549
[SPEAKER_01]: So it looks like that more games, hopefully, are going to be incorporating that type of thing, like a...

498
00:33:49,156 --> 00:33:50,378
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's Online, that kind of thing.

499
00:33:50,619 --> 00:33:53,323
[SPEAKER_03]: So, unfortunately though, it's not going to be centralized.

500
00:33:53,523 --> 00:33:55,366
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be up to the game people to put it in their games.

501
00:33:55,566 --> 00:33:55,807
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

502
00:33:56,929 --> 00:34:00,354
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they're not getting it.

503
00:34:00,995 --> 00:34:02,558
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think they...

504
00:34:04,562 --> 00:34:05,803
[SPEAKER_01]: Microsoft's already figured it out.

505
00:34:32,865 --> 00:34:34,386
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll implement it when they feel like it.

506
00:34:34,546 --> 00:34:35,386
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that's true.

507
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:39,729
[SPEAKER_03]: At least they don't charge, and if you want to play games on Xbox Live, you've got to pay.

508
00:34:39,749 --> 00:34:41,389
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't charge, and it shows.

509
00:34:42,610 --> 00:34:43,170
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, anyway.

510
00:34:43,991 --> 00:34:44,531
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways.

511
00:34:46,152 --> 00:34:50,274
[SPEAKER_02]: However, retailers are charging for games, and here's what's coming out this week.

512
00:34:50,854 --> 00:34:53,515
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a whole lot, and it's a lot of leftovers, actually.

513
00:34:54,196 --> 00:34:58,178
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, BlackSate Area 51 is finally making its way out on the PlayStation 3.

514
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,301
[SPEAKER_02]: Way to be on top of things midway.

515
00:35:01,862 --> 00:35:04,004
[SPEAKER_02]: Go Unreal Tournament 3 engine!

516
00:35:04,124 --> 00:35:05,385
[SPEAKER_02]: Or Unreal Engine 3, whatever.

517
00:35:06,906 --> 00:35:11,489
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of Unreal, Unreal Tournament 3 is coming out this week on PS3 as well.

518
00:35:13,211 --> 00:35:16,013
[SPEAKER_02]: Universe at War, Earth Assault on the PC.

[SPEAKER_02]: Warriors of the Lost Empire on PSP.

520
00:35:21,957 --> 00:35:22,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see here.

521
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:28,882
[SPEAKER_02]: NCAA March Madness 2008, coming out on PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, and 360.

522
00:35:30,502 --> 00:35:34,104
[SPEAKER_02]: Luxor 2 on the DS, hooray.

523
00:35:36,264 --> 00:35:42,727
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see here, Super Swing Golf Season 2, that's going to be coming out, in case you liked the last one.

524
00:35:44,047 --> 00:35:46,428
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how many people are getting this.

525
00:35:46,928 --> 00:35:47,628
[SPEAKER_02]: Madden NFL 08 Español!

526
00:35:50,083 --> 00:35:51,123
[SPEAKER_02]: The Spanish version.

527
00:35:51,143 --> 00:35:52,303
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, you know what?

528
00:35:52,363 --> 00:35:55,984
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes the game appealing to an audience that maybe wasn't able to get into it before, you know?

529
00:35:56,804 --> 00:35:57,364
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

530
00:35:57,564 --> 00:35:58,724
[SPEAKER_02]: Now with more luchadors.

531
00:36:00,365 --> 00:36:01,525
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, that's not true.

532
00:36:02,205 --> 00:36:03,465
[SPEAKER_01]: The luchadors are great.

533
00:36:05,046 --> 00:36:05,446
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that it?

534
00:36:08,266 --> 00:36:09,046
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

535
00:36:10,446 --> 00:36:12,127
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's not it.

536
00:36:12,687 --> 00:36:13,947
[SPEAKER_02]: The Golden Compass on PC.

537
00:36:14,347 --> 00:36:15,407

543
00:37:18,908 --> 00:37:20,209
[SPEAKER_03]: Shanghai comes out.

544
00:37:20,309 --> 00:37:23,771
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if that's a redone version of the old Mahjong game, but I don't know.

545
00:37:24,112 --> 00:37:25,152
[SPEAKER_03]: That comes out on the Nintendo Wii.

546
00:37:25,192 --> 00:37:26,013
[SPEAKER_03]: I somehow doubt that.

547
00:37:26,753 --> 00:37:29,315
[SPEAKER_03]: Soul Calibur Legends also makes its way to the Nintendo Wii.

548

[SPEAKER_03]: And We Love Golf also comes out on the Nintendo Wii.

550
00:37:35,999 --> 00:37:37,700
[SPEAKER_03]: That's coming over here in February, I believe.

551
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:38,481
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it?

552
00:37:38,501 --> 00:37:39,161
[SPEAKER_03]: The Capcom one.

553
00:37:40,954 --> 00:37:47,259
[SPEAKER_03]: Also coming out on other systems, we have the PlayStation 2 gets Hakarina Heart comes out as well as Spectral Gene.

554
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,801
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's all the PS2 gets this week.

555
00:37:50,942 --> 00:37:58,008
[SPEAKER_03]: And coming out on the Nintendo DS, Fujinomori no Let's Tarot is coming out.

556
00:37:58,309 --> 00:37:58,609
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

557
00:37:59,189 --> 00:38:00,711
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder if that's a tarot card game.

558
00:38:00,731 --> 00:38:02,432
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

559
00:38:03,253 --> 00:38:07,076

561
00:38:31,531 --> 00:38:32,711
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, with Imagine Babies?

562
00:38:32,891 --> 00:38:34,712
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we've got Imagine Babies.

563
00:38:34,932 --> 00:38:35,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Very interesting game.

564
00:38:35,952 --> 00:38:40,673
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Fujinomori No Let's Tarot does look to be a tarot card game for the DS.

565
00:38:40,713 --> 00:38:41,433
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds like fun.

566
00:38:41,493 --> 00:38:42,154
[SPEAKER_01]: Jamie wants.

567
00:38:42,454 --> 00:38:48,175
[SPEAKER_03]: And Shanghai is indeed a version of the old Mahjong classic on the Nintendo Wii.

568
00:38:48,235 --> 00:38:48,995
[SPEAKER_03]: It is indeed that.

569
00:38:49,235 --> 00:38:51,656
[SPEAKER_03]: So, there you have it, your Japanese release dates.

570
00:38:52,616 --> 00:38:55,597
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, for our friends in the UK, not a whole bunch is coming out.

571
00:38:56,897 --> 00:38:59,038
[SPEAKER_01]: On the 14th is Beowulf.

00:39:01,565 --> 00:39:06,507
[SPEAKER_01]: Half-Life 2 Episode 2, Portal, Team Fortress 2, The Orange Box Wait, didn't I already do these?

574
00:39:07,627 --> 00:39:08,527
[SPEAKER_01]: You know it says December.

575
00:39:10,028 --> 00:39:12,148
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, okay, it's being all bizarre.

576
00:39:13,108 --> 00:39:17,950
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Beowulf, Half-Life 2 Episode 2, Portal, Team Fortress 2, and then The Orange Box.

577
00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:20,051
[SPEAKER_01]: They are releasing them separately.

00:39:20,391 --> 00:39:22,551
[SPEAKER_01]: Time Shift and Wipeout Pulse.

579
00:39:23,532 --> 00:39:28,053
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course all of the Half-Life related things were on PlayStation 3.

580
00:39:30,791 --> 00:39:32,672
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, kind of a slow week over in the UK.

581
00:39:32,972 --> 00:39:33,313
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

582
00:39:33,653 --> 00:39:33,913
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh well.

583
00:39:34,713 --> 00:39:36,975
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it'll get a little more busy before the end of the year.

584
00:39:37,895 --> 00:39:41,037
[SPEAKER_03]: Or at least early next year when they start getting all the stuff that we got this year.

585
00:39:41,197 --> 00:39:42,238
[SPEAKER_03]: Poor guys over there.

586
00:39:43,398 --> 00:39:48,941
[SPEAKER_01]: I will be more than happy to send gifts overseas if people send me... Money!

587
00:39:49,662 --> 00:39:50,002
[SPEAKER_01]: ...boos.

588
00:39:50,903 --> 00:39:51,163
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

589
00:39:51,223 --> 00:39:52,203
[SPEAKER_01]: I want Christmas crackers.

590
00:39:53,664 --> 00:39:55,025
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get back into the gaming news.

591
00:39:55,606 --> 00:40:00,330
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, it's another week, so that means there must be another Korean MMO coming.

592
00:40:01,751 --> 00:40:05,274
[SPEAKER_02]: And this time, it's going to be a game called Perfect KO.

593
00:40:05,774 --> 00:40:11,999
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually a fighting game MMO, and it's got an unlikely duo of characters that are going to be making their way to it.

594
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:18,164
[SPEAKER_02]: And those two characters, of course, would be Ken and Chung-Li from the Street Fighter series.

595
00:40:18,825 --> 00:40:20,066
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually looks kind of neat.

596
00:40:20,226 --> 00:40:23,048
[SPEAKER_02]: It's sort of like a 3D brawl game or something like that.

597
00:40:23,775 --> 00:40:29,556
[SPEAKER_02]: and then of course as you beat up more people you can customize your avatar and that kind of fun stuff.

598
00:40:30,696 --> 00:40:35,037
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's kind of neat to see that they're actually licensing characters from Capcom.

599
00:40:35,077 --> 00:40:37,118
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully they'll license characters from some other things.

600
00:40:39,878 --> 00:40:40,558
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to be interesting.

601
00:40:40,578 --> 00:40:43,059
[SPEAKER_03]: What other kind of characters are in this game besides Ken and Tony?

602
00:40:43,239 --> 00:40:44,479
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't really mention.

603
00:40:44,599 --> 00:40:48,140
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot of stuff that they've designed themselves but the character designs are really cool.

604
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:50,480
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know...

605
00:40:50,953 --> 00:40:56,715
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd be nice to see, like, some of these characters from this Korean game, like, move over to, say, like, Street Fighter 4 or something like that.

606
00:40:57,556 --> 00:41:00,997
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, speaking of Street Fighter 4, there were a lot of new details released this week.

607
00:41:01,057 --> 00:41:05,299
[SPEAKER_03]: First off, I've got to ask, though, did you hear about the drama going on behind the Street Fighter 4 news?

608
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:14,923
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, this Brazilian news site put out these screenshots from Street Fighter 4, these new screenshots besides the one we'd seen previously.

609
00:41:15,523 --> 00:41:20,605
[SPEAKER_03]: They put out some new screenshots and, you know, one-up sick the lawyers on them, or Zip Davis would say sick the lawyers on them.

610
00:41:21,005 --> 00:41:26,546
[SPEAKER_03]: and people were like, you know, rah, rah, rah, the corporation's taking down the independent voice.

611
00:41:26,626 --> 00:41:28,767
[SPEAKER_03]: And certainly I was kind of going, you know, a little bit of that too.

612
00:41:28,807 --> 00:41:30,407
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, boy, those bastards, da, da, da.

613
00:41:30,847 --> 00:41:40,510
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the same time, it turns out, who knew that actually the leak came from the fact that the person that runs that website is some type of contractor for EGM in Brazil.

614
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:44,370
[SPEAKER_03]: So he actually did steal internal information, I guess, ended up admitting to it.

615
00:41:44,871 --> 00:41:46,871
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know why he did that.

616
00:41:47,389 --> 00:41:48,390
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

617
00:42:12,466 --> 00:42:15,869
[SPEAKER_03]: and EGM's not happy about it because this is how they were going to sell their magazines this week.

618
00:42:16,349 --> 00:42:18,431
[SPEAKER_03]: The game will actually run at 60 frames per second.

619
00:42:18,871 --> 00:42:23,595
[SPEAKER_03]: The storyline takes place between Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo and Street Fighter 3.

620
00:42:24,456 --> 00:42:26,398
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of old school characters will return.

621
00:42:26,798 --> 00:42:31,262
[SPEAKER_03]: There's going to be two new female characters but no characters from Street Fighter 3.

622
00:42:32,282 --> 00:42:35,705
[SPEAKER_03]: So you kind of wonder if Capcom isn't just kind of writing off Street Fighter 3 in a way.

623
00:42:35,725 --> 00:42:40,809
[SPEAKER_02]: You should have brought like what was that guy's name Oro back but he can have both of his arms this time.

624
00:42:40,969 --> 00:42:41,610
[SPEAKER_02]: You know like

625
00:42:42,005 --> 00:42:42,566
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

626
00:43:01,221 --> 00:43:07,222
[SPEAKER_03]: As most people speculated, the screenshots that you do see in the pictures floating around the internet right now is Chun-Li's new stage.

627
00:43:07,862 --> 00:43:10,803
[SPEAKER_03]: The parry system that was in Street Fighter 3, gone.

628
00:43:11,383 --> 00:43:16,284
[SPEAKER_03]: New system in place, it's called Saving Revenge, something like that, some new system is in place.

629
00:43:16,884 --> 00:43:21,325
[SPEAKER_03]: It's built around cancels, and there will be its own gauge that's separate from the super meter.

630
00:43:21,665 --> 00:43:25,986
[SPEAKER_03]: There are supers in the game, don't know if it's Street Fighter 3s or Super Street Fighter 2 turbos.

631
00:43:26,326 --> 00:43:27,607
[SPEAKER_03]: There's also ultras!

632
00:43:28,027 --> 00:43:29,607
[SPEAKER_03]: My god, there's lots of different types of moves.

633
00:43:29,967 --> 00:43:31,068
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the other weird thing.

634
00:43:31,568 --> 00:43:34,009
[SPEAKER_03]: Shang Long may actually be in the game.

635
00:43:35,170 --> 00:43:42,574
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's kind of a may, and we don't know if that's just a running gag from EGM, because that was like one of their first April Fool's jokes, like years ago.

636
00:43:43,015 --> 00:43:46,117
[SPEAKER_03]: Back when I used to get that magazine delivered to my house, like 15 years ago.

637
00:43:46,397 --> 00:43:47,277
[SPEAKER_03]: Back when it was good.

638
00:43:47,998 --> 00:43:49,338
[SPEAKER_03]: Back in the day, certainly.

639
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:58,750
[SPEAKER_03]: And rumor is we will see Street Fighter 4 in the arcades with online play, also in the PlayStation 3 and 360, all of them online.

640
00:43:59,070 --> 00:44:02,132
[SPEAKER_03]: Wouldn't it be cool if the console versions interfaced with the arcade somehow?

641
00:44:03,353 --> 00:44:08,836
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, then you kind of wonder why would anybody go to the arcade, but community, and maybe there'll be something special with the arcade version.

642
00:44:08,856 --> 00:44:14,560
[SPEAKER_02]: If it did, it'd probably be only with the PlayStation 3 version, since you've got live, and live isn't cross-platform very easily.

643
00:44:15,188 --> 00:44:18,071
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they got Final Fantasy XI to work somehow, so it's possible.

644
00:44:18,111 --> 00:44:23,676
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but see, Final Fantasy XI runs off the Square Enix servers because you're connecting to PlayOnline.

645
00:44:23,836 --> 00:44:25,378
[SPEAKER_02]: That's totally separate.

646
00:44:25,398 --> 00:44:27,760
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why you have to pay that stupid monthly fee.

647
00:44:28,701 --> 00:44:36,008
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyways, obviously take some of that stuff with a grain of salt in regards to Shang Long and the online arcade stuff.

648
00:44:36,408 --> 00:44:37,509
[SPEAKER_03]: Take all that with a grain of salt.

649
00:44:37,569 --> 00:44:40,031
[SPEAKER_03]: But it does sound, as far as the rest of it, that it's pretty cemented.

650
00:44:41,132 --> 00:44:42,613
[SPEAKER_03]: The 60 frames a second and stuff.

651
00:44:42,673 --> 00:44:44,214
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds like it's going to be a winner.

652
00:44:44,734 --> 00:44:48,716
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have to say I'm already a little more excited about Street Fighter 4 than I ever was about Street Fighter 3.

653
00:44:48,896 --> 00:44:49,656
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks pretty good.

654
00:44:49,676 --> 00:44:52,158
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the art style in it.

655
00:44:52,498 --> 00:44:57,460
[SPEAKER_02]: I was kind of crossing my fingers that it would be more like the trailer because that was really cool.

656
00:44:58,020 --> 00:44:59,521
[SPEAKER_02]: But the art style is okay.

657
00:44:59,781 --> 00:45:02,482
[SPEAKER_02]: I like what they're doing where it's 3D but it's 2D type thing.

658
00:45:03,563 --> 00:45:09,886
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the facial animations though that they had, like some of the screenshots, a little weird.

659
00:45:10,669 --> 00:45:13,111
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks a little wonky, but I think you'll be fine.

660
00:45:14,171 --> 00:45:16,412
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, I know you've been a Street Fighter fan for ages and ages.

661
00:45:17,153 --> 00:45:18,334
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you happy about Street Fighter 4?

662
00:45:19,154 --> 00:45:22,096
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm reserving judgment until I actually play it.

663
00:45:22,476 --> 00:45:24,377
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so you're not letting the hype get to you at all?

664
00:45:24,597 --> 00:45:25,578
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope.

665
00:45:25,818 --> 00:45:26,298
[SPEAKER_03]: Fair enough.

666
00:45:26,558 --> 00:45:32,522
[SPEAKER_04]: I still think that it's only going to take a week before a bunch of fighting game fans completely break the system.

667
00:45:34,034 --> 00:45:34,834
[SPEAKER_03]: If it is online?

668
00:45:35,375 --> 00:45:36,735
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, not just online.

669
00:45:36,815 --> 00:45:37,936
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, just the game itself.

670
00:45:37,956 --> 00:45:40,176
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not dedicated there.

671
00:45:40,197 --> 00:45:41,797
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll break any fighting game system.

672
00:45:41,857 --> 00:45:43,278
[SPEAKER_03]: Figure out how to cheat real quick.

673
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:44,518
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

674
00:45:45,138 --> 00:45:45,739
[SPEAKER_03]: We will see.

675
00:45:45,799 --> 00:45:47,359
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, let's move on to some more news.

676
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:55,482
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, for the Xbox Originals, they are, well, region locked.

677
00:45:55,703 --> 00:45:56,543
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't get past it.

678
00:45:59,211 --> 00:46:02,313
[SPEAKER_01]: Where the Japanese demos are working, the games themselves are not.

679
00:46:02,733 --> 00:46:04,094
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no such thing as can't.

680
00:46:04,394 --> 00:46:05,215
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I say.

681
00:46:06,215 --> 00:46:10,358
[SPEAKER_03]: Just not now is what Loki is hoping for this.

682
00:46:10,639 --> 00:46:12,060
[SPEAKER_03]: But they got some extra games in Japan.

683
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:15,162
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, not necessarily extra, but they got different games in Japan than we got here.

684
00:46:15,622 --> 00:46:16,743
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the problem.

685
00:46:16,983 --> 00:46:17,743
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead.

686
00:46:17,884 --> 00:46:22,647
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they actually tested, for example, with Magatama.

687
00:46:22,687 --> 00:46:26,910
[SPEAKER_01]: They said that they got a message that said the download was not available in your region.

688
00:46:28,951 --> 00:46:32,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think it's because it's either looking at one of two things.

689
00:46:32,153 --> 00:46:36,615
[SPEAKER_02]: It's either looking at the region of your console, which case, yeah, you're kind of screwed then.

690
00:46:37,855 --> 00:46:39,896
[SPEAKER_02]: Or it's looking at the region of your IP.

691
00:46:40,356 --> 00:46:47,740
[SPEAKER_02]: If that's the case, you could probably just route your IP through a mirror, say, somewhere overseas, and then it might work.

692
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:51,341
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm guessing it's looking at the region of your console, because that would make more sense.

693
00:46:52,122 --> 00:46:52,742
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's weird, though.

694
00:46:52,782 --> 00:46:54,723
[SPEAKER_02]: It just won't let you download it whatsoever.

695
00:46:56,135 --> 00:46:56,696
[SPEAKER_02]: Who cares?

696
00:46:56,736 --> 00:46:57,918
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a fucking Xbox game.

697
00:46:57,958 --> 00:46:58,399
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously.

698
00:46:59,281 --> 00:47:01,905
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you... I don't know.

699
00:47:03,128 --> 00:47:04,109
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an Xbox game.

700
00:47:04,430 --> 00:47:05,552
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you really need to download it?

701
00:47:05,672 --> 00:47:05,993
[SPEAKER_02]: It's old.

702
00:47:06,534 --> 00:47:06,814
[SPEAKER_03]: Please don't...

703
00:47:08,015 --> 00:47:08,596
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

704
00:47:08,696 --> 00:47:24,651
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm noticing that because of the old Xbox games coming back, I've had a lot of friends tell me that Indigo Prophecy, kind of a game that may have been, I don't want to say overlooked, because it certainly had its fans, but overlooked by many, is kind of getting a little bit of a resurgence with this.

705
00:47:24,691 --> 00:47:29,956
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've had people actually send me messages on Xbox Live going, dude, you need to check out Indigo Prophecy if you haven't already played it before.

706
00:47:29,976 --> 00:47:30,617
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of fun.

707
00:47:32,202 --> 00:47:33,563
[SPEAKER_02]: Buy it in the stores, people.

708
00:47:33,623 --> 00:47:35,764
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably cheaper than buying it online.

709
00:47:36,525 --> 00:47:39,206
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, and then you get the disc and maybe a manual.

710
00:47:40,147 --> 00:47:45,210
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, instead of having to read a PDF file online, you know, just go look.

711
00:47:45,370 --> 00:47:48,492
[SPEAKER_02]: This stuff is so old, it's probably dirt cheap by now.

712
00:47:49,773 --> 00:47:50,893
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess there's one way to find out.

713
00:47:50,913 --> 00:47:51,854
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to go out there and shop.

714
00:47:51,914 --> 00:47:53,015
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you want to hear something funny?

715
00:47:53,035 --> 00:47:55,436
[SPEAKER_02]: What is it?

716
00:47:56,917 --> 00:47:57,237
[SPEAKER_02]: Shut up.

717
00:47:57,778 --> 00:47:58,158
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways...

718
00:47:59,127 --> 00:48:04,489
[SPEAKER_02]: Catamari Damacy, that game when it came out, that was like a $20 game, wasn't it?

719
00:48:05,409 --> 00:48:06,350
[SPEAKER_02]: The original one on PlayStation 2?

720
00:48:06,390 --> 00:48:06,550
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

721
00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:07,570
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was a budget game, $20 game.

722
00:48:07,590 --> 00:48:08,490
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody used a GameStop for $30.

723
00:48:08,550 --> 00:48:09,811
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, $10 over retail and it's used.

724
00:48:16,642 --> 00:48:17,082
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

725
00:48:17,202 --> 00:48:19,223
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's because they don't make it retail anymore, right?

726
00:48:19,243 --> 00:48:20,163
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter, though.

727
00:48:20,483 --> 00:48:21,703
[SPEAKER_02]: It should still be cheap.

728
00:48:21,943 --> 00:48:25,044
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, what about, okay, what about, like, freaking old-ass PlayStation 1 games?

729
00:48:25,064 --> 00:48:28,064
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, for the longest time, Intelligent Cube, they were charging an arm and a leg for.

730
00:48:28,384 --> 00:48:34,686
[SPEAKER_02]: Symphony of the Night, before it was out on Xbox Live, they were charging... But I didn't think Katamari, the first one, had a really high demand for it.

731
00:48:34,746 --> 00:48:38,527
[SPEAKER_02]: And, like, Street Fighter, was it Marvel vs. Street Fighter 2?

732
00:48:38,647 --> 00:48:40,967
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going for, you know, quite a bit.

733
00:48:41,447 --> 00:48:44,268
[SPEAKER_02]: But... Or Marvel vs. Capcom 2.

734
00:48:45,108 --> 00:48:45,488
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um...

735
00:48:46,058 --> 00:48:52,022
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't think Katamari was going to bring in demand of $10 over retail, especially used.

736
00:48:54,964 --> 00:48:57,245
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's go ahead and move on with the news.

737
00:48:57,745 --> 00:49:01,648
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, there's yet another stupid lawsuit that goes...

738
00:49:02,438 --> 00:49:03,338
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes with Halo 3.

739
00:49:03,398 --> 00:49:05,999
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, Halo 3, more stupid lawsuits.

740
00:49:06,379 --> 00:49:12,240
[SPEAKER_02]: This time, some dumb shit is complaining that there's not a lot of, um, there's some pixels missing, apparently.

741
00:49:12,601 --> 00:49:17,302
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, apparently, Halo 3, you know, is upscaled 600, or 640p, I guess.

742
00:49:17,682 --> 00:49:22,463
[SPEAKER_02]: It's missing 80 pixels, and they explain why they did that and stuff.

743
00:49:22,483 --> 00:49:27,764
[SPEAKER_02]: So now they're suing because it's not truly 720p.

744
00:49:27,784 --> 00:49:29,665
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're saying it's false advertising.

745
00:49:29,905 --> 00:49:30,105
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

746
00:49:30,125 --> 00:49:30,205
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

747
00:49:31,624 --> 00:49:32,245
[SPEAKER_03]: For real?

748
00:49:32,905 --> 00:49:33,966
[SPEAKER_04]: This person's for real?

749
00:49:34,887 --> 00:49:43,993
[SPEAKER_04]: It's sad, and, you know what, I heard about this, and I actually looked at the back of the box, and on the back it just says, HDTV, you know, 720p, 1080i, 1080p.

750
00:49:44,013 --> 00:49:50,058
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't explicitly say, this game runs natively in these formats.

751
00:49:50,358 --> 00:49:51,279
[SPEAKER_02]: But what game does?

752
00:49:51,699 --> 00:49:52,220
[SPEAKER_02]: None of them do.

753
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:53,260
[SPEAKER_02]: No, none of them.

754
00:49:53,581 --> 00:49:57,283
[SPEAKER_02]: And here's the thing, is I would say, okay, why don't you count the pixels that are on your TV there?

755
00:49:57,303 --> 00:49:57,524
[SPEAKER_02]: 720 of them?

756
00:49:57,564 --> 00:49:57,844
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, shut up.

757
00:50:01,451 --> 00:50:05,754
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're trying to say it's false advertising because the game wasn't programmed in 720 or whatever.

758
00:50:05,814 --> 00:50:06,794
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever, dude.

759
00:50:06,814 --> 00:50:09,116
[SPEAKER_03]: That is seriously a stupid complaint.

760
00:50:10,176 --> 00:50:11,217
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to get thrown out.

761
00:50:12,198 --> 00:50:12,698
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope so.

762
00:50:13,999 --> 00:50:19,742
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, all I know is that all these freaking Halo 3 lawsuits, god damn they make us mad.

763
00:50:19,862 --> 00:50:21,183
[SPEAKER_03]: And when we get mad, people die.

764
00:50:37,088 --> 00:50:40,429
[SPEAKER_01]: It is time for my annual Christmas FU.

765
00:50:42,130 --> 00:50:46,091
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a combination of everything about the holiday season that pisses me off.

766
00:50:47,732 --> 00:51:01,336
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and again, it's all pretty ridiculous, you know, I'm not attacking anybody, but first of all, the people who over-decorate their houses that look like Christmas puked all over their house, oh my god, learn what aesthetics are for!

767
00:51:01,996 --> 00:51:03,377
[SPEAKER_01]: Seriously, what about that tree?

768
00:51:04,509 --> 00:51:07,830
[SPEAKER_03]: Did I not tell you that tree was hideous?

769
00:51:08,030 --> 00:51:08,310
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

770
00:51:09,570 --> 00:51:11,870
[SPEAKER_01]: And Rob put it best when he told me about it at first.

771
00:51:12,370 --> 00:51:17,231
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole top part of the tree is not lit because probably a light bulb burnt out.

772
00:51:17,271 --> 00:51:24,533
[SPEAKER_03]: There's this ginormous tree in front of a church and it's like it's not wearing a top because a bulb burned out at the top of the tree or something.

773
00:51:24,593 --> 00:51:25,493
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what I think though.

774
00:51:25,513 --> 00:51:26,453
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that's it.

775
00:51:26,573 --> 00:51:30,634
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they just actually didn't decorate it because there's different types of lights.

776
00:51:31,074 --> 00:51:31,234
[SPEAKER_01]: There's

777
00:51:31,892 --> 00:51:32,733
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

778
00:51:52,143 --> 00:51:53,924
[SPEAKER_03]: We have some tacky Christmas lights here in the studio.

779
00:51:54,344 --> 00:51:55,024
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cute.

780
00:51:55,624 --> 00:51:58,485
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I can, like, the icicle lights are nice.

781
00:51:59,005 --> 00:52:03,126
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe having a Santa in your front yard or decorating a tree in your front yard.

782
00:52:03,626 --> 00:52:06,527
[SPEAKER_01]: But, like, this is the worst example ever.

783
00:52:06,547 --> 00:52:13,349
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's one house that was in Mobile, Alabama that I saw right before probably the year I moved out.

784
00:52:14,009 --> 00:52:19,430
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was these people who shunned Christmas lights all over their yard, across their yard, in patches.

785
00:52:19,851 --> 00:52:21,271
[SPEAKER_01]: Their house freaking glowed.

786
00:52:22,102 --> 00:52:33,862
[SPEAKER_01]: and I was like and on top of that they were all multicolored so it looked like that cut like just like throw up I'm not joking and that originated the phrase Christmas threw up on that house I saw a very offensive house last night

787
00:52:34,458 --> 00:52:45,905
[SPEAKER_03]: and it was one of those houses where they had the radio station playing and you tune your car to a certain frequency on the radio and then you can, like, the lights flash in sync with the music.

788
00:52:46,406 --> 00:52:46,686
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?

789
00:52:46,986 --> 00:52:54,011
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, but it's hideous because if you don't have the radio station turned on it just looks like this house is randomly flashing all of their lights.

790
00:52:54,791 --> 00:53:00,753
[SPEAKER_03]: and I swear to God I almost had a seizure driving by that house.

791
00:53:00,793 --> 00:53:01,393
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not funny.

792
00:53:01,753 --> 00:53:09,815
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, somebody is going to crash into that house and all the kids in that house are going to be in a fire because that house is going to cause somebody to have a seizure.

793
00:53:10,535 --> 00:53:12,936
[SPEAKER_01]: On top of that, imagine these people's freaking power bill.

794
00:53:15,838 --> 00:53:43,950
[SPEAKER_01]: and another part of my FU goes towards people who are thinking that Christmas is actually only the celebration that happens around this year when there's a bunch of different religions that celebrate around the same time every year and that really Christmas should actually be in like spring if you're going by quote biblical standards because the census would have happened in the spring and you guys stole a pagan holiday thank you Catholic Church but you know

795
00:53:45,285 --> 00:53:51,507
[SPEAKER_03]: You can address those cards and letters to Jamie What about the people that have the big inflatable snow globes in their front lawn?

796
00:53:51,527 --> 00:53:52,807
[SPEAKER_02]: You gotta love that shit, huh?

797
00:53:53,127 --> 00:54:10,153
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I don't mind one but I drove by a house that had three and a giant inflatable Santa whose legs were broken so he was laying on his nose This is in my neighborhood That's a prime target for a BB gun Someone broke Santa's legs?

798
00:54:10,273 --> 00:54:14,314
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not very nice Someone broke Santa's legs Santa didn't give some mobsters presents this year

799
00:54:15,679 --> 00:54:25,070
[SPEAKER_01]: But no, there's just, you know, I really... It's the whole over-commercialism of everything and the fact that people get so close-minded.

800
00:54:25,130 --> 00:54:27,692
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, here's part three of my Christmas FU.

801
00:54:27,732 --> 00:54:28,353
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Christ.

802
00:54:28,954 --> 00:54:29,514
[SPEAKER_01]: Drivers!

803
00:54:30,235 --> 00:54:35,601
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I can't do an FU without bringing up how stupidly mean people get during the holidays.

804
00:54:36,922 --> 00:54:37,243
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

805
00:54:38,836 --> 00:54:49,325
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to buy something at the store, and this person's pushing past me buying their Christmas tree, and I'm like, I was in line for... I'm like, shit!

806
00:54:49,985 --> 00:54:55,890
[SPEAKER_01]: And then everybody drives like a freaking retard on the road because they have to get to the mall.

807
00:54:57,051 --> 00:55:01,174
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just like, okay, what happened to the whole, you know...

808
00:55:02,114 --> 00:55:09,955
[SPEAKER_01]: Being nice to everybody during the holidays and trying to share the spirit and everything because people don't give a shit about the Christmas spirit.

809
00:55:09,975 --> 00:55:11,716
[SPEAKER_01]: They care about their own personal agenda.

810
00:55:12,556 --> 00:55:15,836
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, maybe there should be more ball shootings if that were the case.

811
00:55:16,116 --> 00:55:17,317
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoa, whoa.

812
00:55:19,177 --> 00:55:20,237
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't go there.

813
00:55:20,377 --> 00:55:21,517
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, too soon.

814
00:55:22,077 --> 00:55:22,598
[SPEAKER_03]: Too soon.

815
00:55:22,618 --> 00:55:23,158
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no, no.

816
00:55:23,618 --> 00:55:30,659
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is the whole thing is that, you know, people are, you know, and I'm getting this from the same people where we're all like,

817
00:55:31,466 --> 00:55:37,651
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, well, you know, holiday this, you know, have to be nice, baby Jesus, whatever.

818
00:55:38,151 --> 00:55:41,514
[SPEAKER_01]: And then these same people are being complete and utter assholes.

819
00:55:42,014 --> 00:55:44,616
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not even, you know, making this up.

820
00:55:44,656 --> 00:55:47,098
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm seeing people that I know do this.

821
00:55:47,639 --> 00:55:51,402
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, God, what a freaking hypocrite, you know?

822
00:55:52,723 --> 00:55:52,903
[SPEAKER_01]: Just...

823
00:55:53,746 --> 00:55:55,670
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't open your mouth around me ever again.

824
00:55:55,690 --> 00:55:57,613
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, quick chat room comments.

825
00:55:57,633 --> 00:56:02,182
[SPEAKER_03]: SSJ100Matt says, Apparently, the higher your energy bill, the more Jesus and God love you.

826
00:56:04,226 --> 00:56:04,867
[SPEAKER_05]: That's brilliant.

827
00:56:05,027 --> 00:56:06,390
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's move on with the FUs.

828
00:56:07,417 --> 00:56:14,702
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, FU to the kids across the street from my apartment complex who were having car wash today.

829
00:56:15,183 --> 00:56:18,685
[SPEAKER_02]: They started at about 9 this morning yelling.

830
00:56:18,825 --> 00:56:24,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, by the way, there was also one of those cars, you know, the ones that have the sound systems that are way too loud with way too much bass.

831
00:56:25,250 --> 00:56:30,253
[SPEAKER_02]: That was playing from 9 in the morning to about 5 in the afternoons.

832
00:56:31,605 --> 00:56:33,486
[SPEAKER_02]: and these kids yelling CARWASH!

833
00:56:33,806 --> 00:56:34,806
[SPEAKER_02]: CARWASH!

834
00:56:35,366 --> 00:56:35,706
CARWASH!

835
00:56:35,886 --> 00:56:37,946
[SPEAKER_02]: for like seven fucking hours.

836
00:56:38,447 --> 00:56:42,467
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's just so annoying all day long.

837
00:56:43,388 --> 00:56:55,310
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and then also I have to do my neighbors who apparently thought it was fun to have a party at four in the morning with their drunken friends who are riding a bike that some kid left outside and they're honking the horn on the bike.

838
00:56:56,930 --> 00:56:58,911
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, you live in a classy part of town.

839
00:56:59,251 --> 00:56:59,951
[SPEAKER_03]: That sucks.

840
00:57:00,575 --> 00:57:00,875
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

841
00:57:02,496 --> 00:57:03,417
[SPEAKER_03]: Puppy, why don't you go ahead.

842
00:57:05,439 --> 00:57:10,623
[SPEAKER_04]: Big F you to ITT Technical Institute and your terrible scheduling policies.

843
00:57:13,004 --> 00:57:16,587
[SPEAKER_04]: I started my program for drafting last year.

844
00:57:17,368 --> 00:57:27,155
[SPEAKER_04]: I should have been done by now, but I'm not going to graduate until six months from now because when I changed my schedule once, it completely fucked me over for the rest of the year.

845
00:57:27,791 --> 00:57:28,812
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

846
00:57:49,434 --> 00:57:51,175
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm actually kind of having a good week.

847
00:57:51,616 --> 00:57:54,839
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess F you to the fact that it's been so cold lately.

848
00:57:55,319 --> 00:57:56,120
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll give an F you to that.

849
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:57,601
[SPEAKER_03]: My house has been very cold lately.

850
00:57:58,682 --> 00:58:02,485
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, since we live in California, we're very spoiled when it comes to cold.

851
00:58:02,965 --> 00:58:05,828
[SPEAKER_03]: And just the slightest bit of cold air, it's like, oh my god, get a jacket!

852
00:58:06,688 --> 00:58:08,550
[SPEAKER_04]: F you to magazine solicitors, too.

853
00:58:09,030 --> 00:58:11,012
[SPEAKER_04]: I had three of them on my door this week.

854
00:58:12,453 --> 00:58:15,516
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody came to my door last night and I told them that I had the flu.

855
00:58:16,303 --> 00:58:18,604
[SPEAKER_01]: and that I was highly contagious and he really should leave.

856
00:58:18,624 --> 00:58:23,104
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are crazy.

857
00:58:23,565 --> 00:58:25,665
[SPEAKER_01]: He just looked at me like, okay, bye.

858
00:58:26,625 --> 00:58:26,905
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

859
00:58:27,185 --> 00:58:28,045
[SPEAKER_01]: I should have thought of that.

860
00:58:28,746 --> 00:58:35,327
[SPEAKER_03]: Around in this neighborhood they just have the kids do all the soliciting because it's kind of hard to tell a kid that you're going to give them a bubonic plague if they don't get off your doorstep.

861
00:58:36,227 --> 00:58:39,328
[SPEAKER_04]: Or you just open your door wearing nothing but a towel.

862
00:58:39,948 --> 00:58:44,709
[SPEAKER_01]: I still though have my favorite story about my friend with the Jehovah's Witnesses.

863
00:58:46,511 --> 00:58:49,972
[SPEAKER_01]: While she was listening to tubular bells... Oh, we gotta get back in the news.

864
00:58:50,772 --> 00:58:51,812
[SPEAKER_01]: Making a red velvet cake.

865
00:58:51,853 --> 00:58:57,154
[SPEAKER_01]: So she came out with this knife with, like, red fluid on it and said, What?!

866
00:59:02,916 --> 00:59:04,696
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my friend that used to work for Lockheed.

867
00:59:05,536 --> 00:59:06,637
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's move on.

868
00:59:06,657 --> 00:59:07,877
[SPEAKER_03]: We gotta get back to gaming news.

869
00:59:08,837 --> 00:59:09,297
[SPEAKER_03]: Weirdos.

870
00:59:09,738 --> 00:59:10,058
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

871
00:59:10,738 --> 00:59:13,360
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and what a heck of a story to get back into.

872
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:17,903
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, our buddy Jeff Gertzman, which took up about an hour of last week's show.

873
00:59:17,943 --> 00:59:24,948
[SPEAKER_03]: We have some quick updates, and I don't want to spend too much time talking in this, because I'll be goddamn if this story just didn't blow up way more than it should have.

874
00:59:24,968 --> 00:59:25,508
[SPEAKER_03]: You got fired.

875
00:59:25,548 --> 00:59:25,928
[SPEAKER_03]: Get over it.

876
00:59:26,189 --> 00:59:26,729
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.

877
00:59:27,533 --> 00:59:29,434
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyhow... Was it that crap you were talking about?

878
00:59:29,494 --> 00:59:32,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I was trying to catch Jamie up on what happened when she was out.

879
00:59:33,575 --> 00:59:35,575
[SPEAKER_03]: So, anyhow, here's your updates.

880
00:59:36,135 --> 00:59:37,716
[SPEAKER_03]: I should have some music that plays during this.

881
00:59:37,736 --> 00:59:38,656
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on, I need music.

882
00:59:39,376 --> 00:59:44,037
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, why don't you give us your thoughts on the issue while we get some happy music to play during the Gersman... Happy music?

883
00:59:44,057 --> 00:59:45,318
[SPEAKER_03]: Should we play some Linkin Park?

884
00:59:45,338 --> 00:59:46,598
[SPEAKER_01]: There's too much updates.

885
00:59:47,038 --> 00:59:50,679
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's too bad that I don't have this song from End of Evangelion.

886
00:59:52,615 --> 00:59:53,816
[SPEAKER_01]: The Happy Suicide Song.

887
00:59:54,097 --> 00:59:54,557
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, hold on.

888
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:57,520
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll play some happy music here while we give you the Jeff Gertzman updates.

889
00:59:57,540 --> 00:59:57,780
[SPEAKER_03]: I got it.

890
00:59:57,800 --> 00:59:57,960
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

891
01:00:04,130 --> 01:00:16,061
[SPEAKER_03]: This week in Gertzmanville, Gertzman made a comment to Joystick.com saying, quote, I stand behind my work regardless of where I do it.

892
01:00:16,521 --> 01:00:20,845
[SPEAKER_03]: If there was content that I felt I couldn't support, it wouldn't see the light of day.

893
01:00:21,606 --> 01:00:25,749
[SPEAKER_03]: Then later on, this week, GameSpot posted a Q&A.

894
01:00:27,113 --> 01:00:28,754
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's a clip from the Q&A.

895
01:00:29,014 --> 01:00:31,676
[SPEAKER_03]: Question, was Eidos Interactive upset by the game's review?

896
01:00:32,216 --> 01:00:39,361
[SPEAKER_03]: Answer, it has been confirmed that Eidos representatives expressed their displeasure to their appropriate contacts at GameSpot, but not to editorial directly.

897
01:00:39,861 --> 01:00:44,044
[SPEAKER_03]: It was not the first time a publisher has voiced disappointment with a game review, and it won't be the last.

898
01:00:44,464 --> 01:00:51,967
[SPEAKER_03]: However, it is strict GameSpot policy never to let any such feelings result in a review score to be altered or a video review to be pulled.

899
01:00:52,668 --> 01:00:55,569
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I'd like to quote Mr. Horse from Eidos.

900
01:00:55,789 --> 01:00:58,010
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, No, sir, I do not like it.

901
01:01:01,772 --> 01:01:08,415
[SPEAKER_03]: In response to the GameSpot Q&A, the users of GameSpot said, Thank you, you assholes, for posting that a whole four days late.

902
01:01:09,324 --> 01:01:20,231
[SPEAKER_03]: Then later on this week, as if no more could go wrong with Kane and Lynch, the review site got criticized by, I'm sorry, the reviews got criticized by Kotaku.

903
01:01:20,291 --> 01:01:30,338
[SPEAKER_03]: They were posting clips of reviews, one of the clips happened to be from Kotaku, and it had a five-star logo above the review, which makes you think, five-star review!

904
01:01:31,139 --> 01:01:37,083
[SPEAKER_03]: But in fact, the five stars were just a graphic, and Kotaku was pissed off because they don't review games in stars.

905
01:01:38,442 --> 01:01:39,763
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't review games, period.

906
01:01:41,084 --> 01:01:42,985
[SPEAKER_02]: So, that's from a preview of the game.

907
01:01:43,526 --> 01:01:46,908
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's your update on what's going on in Gertzmanville.

908
01:01:48,629 --> 01:01:50,190
[SPEAKER_02]: And to be honest, I don't really care anymore.

909
01:01:50,270 --> 01:01:52,112
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, stop caring.

910
01:01:52,172 --> 01:01:53,212
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Rob?

911
01:01:53,292 --> 01:01:54,693
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't care in the first place.

912
01:01:54,753 --> 01:01:55,434
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad to hear it.

913
01:01:55,814 --> 01:01:59,457
[SPEAKER_01]: That's because you're all better people than I. That's because I wasn't here, thank God.

914
01:01:59,757 --> 01:02:02,078
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

915
01:02:02,619 --> 01:02:05,421
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's move on then, past Gertzman Gate, if we could.

916
01:02:05,701 --> 01:02:07,002
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I have something that's

917
01:02:07,631 --> 01:02:10,734
[SPEAKER_01]: A little happy, except that I think that it was already there.

918
01:02:11,874 --> 01:02:16,458
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a press release come out from Gravity that they've opened a U.S.

919
01:02:16,538 --> 01:02:23,704
[SPEAKER_01]: studio under the name of L5 Games, and they've hired Blizzard folks to help run it.

920
01:02:24,144 --> 01:02:33,472
[SPEAKER_01]: But the thing is that, now it says that it's in San Mateo, but I actually remember trying to report Gravity to the Better Business Bureau.

921
01:02:36,554 --> 01:02:37,115
[SPEAKER_03]: The fuck?

922
01:02:38,220 --> 01:02:45,862
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was still on IRO because of some sort of banning of an account that was falsely done.

923
01:02:46,683 --> 01:02:47,643
[SPEAKER_01]: This was a long time ago.

924
01:02:48,003 --> 01:02:53,165
[SPEAKER_01]: But I was trying to find the stuff for somebody to report them to the Better Business Bureau.

925
01:02:53,885 --> 01:03:00,667
[SPEAKER_01]: And it turned out that every time I tried to pull up the address for them, it came up with a San Mateo address.

926
01:03:02,167 --> 01:03:04,168
[SPEAKER_01]: But this was like six years ago.

927
01:03:04,867 --> 01:03:05,507
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

928
01:03:32,384 --> 01:03:37,405
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was pretty much because of, you know, all the crappy feedback that came out.

929
01:03:38,925 --> 01:03:40,446
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why we have Better Business Bureau.

930
01:03:41,086 --> 01:03:42,226
[SPEAKER_04]: They just supply feedback.

931
01:03:42,706 --> 01:03:44,026
[SPEAKER_03]: Gravity's just coming over to the U.S.

932
01:03:44,046 --> 01:03:46,727
[SPEAKER_01]: I got free food because I reported a restaurant to the Better Business Bureau.

933
01:03:47,907 --> 01:03:50,748
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to increase their presence in the U.S.

934
01:03:50,808 --> 01:03:53,388
[SPEAKER_03]: so that Gravity can single-handedly take on Activision Blizzard.

935
01:03:54,589 --> 01:03:55,469
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what it is, right?

936
01:03:56,489 --> 01:03:57,109
[SPEAKER_01]: Good luck.

937
01:03:57,969 --> 01:03:58,269
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

938
01:03:59,370 --> 01:04:01,270
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll stick with my, you know, private servers.

939
01:04:01,290 --> 01:04:01,550
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

940
01:04:02,116 --> 01:04:04,477
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, let's see here.

941
01:04:06,518 --> 01:04:09,940
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, sometimes you might compare gravity to sucking, you know.

942
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:16,543
[SPEAKER_02]: There's service and stuff, so, well, here's something else that sucks, or that probably will suck.

943
01:04:16,764 --> 01:04:17,824
[SPEAKER_02]: The Castlevania movie!

944
01:04:18,544 --> 01:04:20,686
[SPEAKER_02]: And, yeah, like, okay, let me put it this way.

945
01:04:20,946 --> 01:04:23,327
[SPEAKER_02]: And this will save us a lot of time in the future.

946
01:04:24,290 --> 01:04:30,076
[SPEAKER_02]: Every single movie that's probably being written right now is on hold because of the writer's strike.

947
01:04:30,116 --> 01:04:33,619
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you have no writer, you can't have any story being written.

948
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:40,686
[SPEAKER_02]: So, like that, the Castlevania movie is on hold because of the writer's strike.

949
01:04:42,207 --> 01:04:46,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that it's like, it's on hold from sucking, I guess.

950
01:04:46,411 --> 01:04:48,914
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, it's like,

951
01:04:49,741 --> 01:04:50,221
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

952
01:05:13,477 --> 01:05:14,377
[SPEAKER_02]: or 200 and some episodes.

953
01:05:14,397 --> 01:05:16,998
[SPEAKER_02]: What episode are we on?

954
01:05:17,018 --> 01:05:16,998
250?

955
01:05:17,198 --> 01:05:19,239
[SPEAKER_02]: 259.

956
01:05:17,298 --> 01:05:19,239
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been doing 100 more episodes, Sammy.

957
01:05:19,259 --> 01:05:20,980
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been working way too damn hard.

958
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:23,021
[SPEAKER_02]: Not recording one of them, but you know what?

959
01:05:23,121 --> 01:05:23,961
[SPEAKER_02]: I do it for practice.

960
01:05:28,603 --> 01:05:29,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

961
01:05:30,410 --> 01:05:38,477
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to make some joke about somebody actually writes those video game movies, but anyway, I totally lost it amongst Loki's high sense of sarcasm.

962
01:05:38,857 --> 01:05:42,741
[SPEAKER_03]: So why don't we spoil the VGAs, which are going on right now on the TV?

963
01:05:43,501 --> 01:05:46,424
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, did you know we're competing against the VGAs tonight, our live stream?

964
01:05:46,844 --> 01:05:48,365
[SPEAKER_03]: So here, why don't we ruin it for you?

965
01:05:48,425 --> 01:05:49,967
[SPEAKER_03]: Bioshock, one game of the year.

966
01:05:50,647 --> 01:05:54,731
[SPEAKER_03]: Harmonix got Studio of the Year, Best Shooter, Call of Duty 4, Modern Warfare.

969
01:06:43,888 --> 01:06:45,188
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, sponsored by you.

970
01:06:45,348 --> 01:06:47,509
[SPEAKER_03]: Although I think that was just a joke, actually.

971
01:06:47,829 --> 01:06:54,050
[SPEAKER_04]: So there, we just did you a favor and saved you from sitting through three hours of garbage advertisements and musical performances.

972
01:06:54,210 --> 01:06:54,750
[SPEAKER_03]: There you have it.

973
01:06:55,350 --> 01:06:57,390
[SPEAKER_03]: You can send us the thank you cards.

974
01:06:57,530 --> 01:06:58,671
[SPEAKER_03]: You can send us Christmas cards.

975
01:06:58,691 --> 01:07:07,632
[SPEAKER_02]: To play devil's advocate here and not to pull you away from listening to our wonderful show, but they are going to have a new trailer for Borderlands, which looks pretty awesome.

976
01:07:07,852 --> 01:07:09,413
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be on YouTube tomorrow.

977
01:07:10,073 --> 01:07:11,273
[SPEAKER_03]: But it looks awesome!

978
01:07:12,305 --> 01:07:14,806
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll look awesome tomorrow on YouTube.

979
01:07:17,167 --> 01:07:23,430
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, going on a tangent with Spike TV, yesterday I was watching a marathon of one of their reality shows because I was bored.

980
01:07:23,470 --> 01:07:23,891
[SPEAKER_03]: Cheaters?

981
01:07:24,131 --> 01:07:25,792
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it was the Ultimate Fighter.

982
01:07:27,032 --> 01:07:30,774
[SPEAKER_04]: It was leading up to their finale UFC thing last night.

983
01:07:31,234 --> 01:07:39,138
[SPEAKER_04]: For eight straight hours, it was nothing but teasing about, oh, we're going to show the cinematic opening to World of Warcraft during the UFC event.

984
01:07:39,773 --> 01:07:46,118
[SPEAKER_04]: and it was the original opening from, you know, three years, it's three years old and they're going to show this on live TV at a UFC event.

985
01:07:47,379 --> 01:07:50,441
[SPEAKER_04]: I couldn't, I couldn't think of a worse audience to target that at.

986
01:07:51,262 --> 01:07:51,742
[SPEAKER_02]: Chat comments.

987
01:07:51,782 --> 01:07:53,023
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't for the new expansion.

988
01:07:54,444 --> 01:07:57,746
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it was the original cinematic opening to the World of Warcraft.

989
01:07:57,806 --> 01:07:58,727
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't Burning Crusade.

990
01:07:59,968 --> 01:08:01,469
[SPEAKER_03]: Comment from, comment from chat.

991
01:08:01,509 --> 01:08:09,075
[SPEAKER_03]: Dark Tetsuya said, the Spike Video Game Awards have been sponsored by Harmonix, 2K Games, EA Sports, it's in the game, and by Mountain Dew, do the dew.

992
01:08:12,843 --> 01:08:16,446
[SPEAKER_01]: So, in stuff that people actually care about... Yes.

993
01:08:17,447 --> 01:08:20,649
[SPEAKER_01]: How about Silent Hill news?

994
01:08:21,290 --> 01:08:21,650
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, yes.

995
01:08:21,890 --> 01:08:22,371
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, please.

996
01:08:22,451 --> 01:08:23,432
[SPEAKER_03]: More Silent Hill 5 news?

997
01:08:24,553 --> 01:08:26,554
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, more like Silent Hill Origins.

998
01:08:26,814 --> 01:08:27,175
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, okay.

999
01:08:27,275 --> 01:08:30,678
[SPEAKER_01]: They're talking about it having a PlayStation 2 port.

1000
01:08:31,719 --> 01:08:32,539
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that'll be kind of fun.

1001
01:08:32,819 --> 01:08:33,840
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that'll be pretty cool.

1002
01:08:34,761 --> 01:08:37,984
[SPEAKER_01]: They're saying that it would...

1003
01:08:38,986 --> 01:08:49,009
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually, of course, being published by Climax, and they would also be presenting a second release.

1004
01:08:51,170 --> 01:08:55,831
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be kind of nice, because Silent Hill is one of those games I can't really get into on a handheld platform.

1005
01:08:55,871 --> 01:09:01,493
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of something I need on a very large TV with all the lights out, so I can cry like a little girl when the monsters come out to eat me.

1006
01:09:01,735 --> 01:09:07,358
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but you see, all you have to do is just get one of those nice PSPs with the video out, and then you can play it on your TV.

1007
01:09:07,518 --> 01:09:09,600
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's true, but I don't have that because I'm not cool.

1008
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:14,943
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the second thing that they're working on is actually an unannounced project.

1009
01:09:16,083 --> 01:09:16,503
[SPEAKER_03]: Dun, dun, dun.

1010
01:09:16,523 --> 01:09:17,744
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope it's more final now.

1011
01:09:17,764 --> 01:09:18,765
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't they just announce it?

1012
01:09:20,486 --> 01:09:20,946
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that it?

1013
01:09:21,386 --> 01:09:22,147
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that was it.

1014
01:09:22,287 --> 01:09:26,029
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you announce an unannounced project, isn't that announcing the project?

1015
01:09:26,434 --> 01:09:27,975
[SPEAKER_01]: How about an untitled project?

1016
01:09:27,995 --> 01:09:28,335
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

1017
01:09:28,615 --> 01:09:32,798
[SPEAKER_01]: Or I should say a secret project because it may have a title.

1018
01:09:32,838 --> 01:09:33,739
[SPEAKER_01]: We just don't know what it is.

1019
01:09:34,999 --> 01:09:37,181
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not secret anymore if you just talked about it.

1020
01:09:38,301 --> 01:09:40,743
[SPEAKER_03]: Macman in our chat room says something interesting here.

1021
01:09:41,023 --> 01:09:44,665
[SPEAKER_03]: Macman says Silent Hill 5 equals awesome and win and shit in my pants.

1022
01:09:46,486 --> 01:09:48,388
[SPEAKER_03]: What kind of comment is that?

1023
01:09:50,329 --> 01:09:53,551
[SPEAKER_03]: Gerardimo says Silent Hill needs to go steal all the VGAs.

1024
01:09:54,580 --> 01:09:55,140
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I agree.

1025
01:09:55,340 --> 01:09:57,822
[SPEAKER_03]: Pyramid Head needs to come do an acceptance speech.

1026
01:09:59,523 --> 01:10:00,804
[SPEAKER_01]: He'll make it with his big knife.

1027
01:10:00,984 --> 01:10:01,484
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

1028
01:10:02,505 --> 01:10:03,685
[SPEAKER_02]: To the entire front row.

1029
01:10:04,786 --> 01:10:06,447
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have to wait until next year then, I guess.

1030
01:10:08,808 --> 01:10:09,709
[SPEAKER_02]: Wouldn't that be a dream?

1031
01:10:10,149 --> 01:10:13,991
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, people are up in arms because GameTap's removing games.

1032
01:10:14,291 --> 01:10:15,112
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1033
01:10:16,198 --> 01:10:23,042
[SPEAKER_02]: Some games you will not be able to play in GameTap anymore include Arthur's First Grade, Bionic Bunny's Good Deeds Contest.

1034
01:10:23,222 --> 01:10:27,344
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, now hold the fuck up because there are actually some good games on that list, Loki.

1035
01:10:27,444 --> 01:10:28,505
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop being such a dick.

1036
01:10:30,406 --> 01:10:33,808
[SPEAKER_03]: There was, I think one of the Civilization games is on there.

1037
01:10:36,009 --> 01:10:36,309
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1038
01:10:37,470 --> 01:10:38,410
[SPEAKER_03]: I know there's games on there.

1039
01:10:38,550 --> 01:10:39,891
[SPEAKER_03]: Impossible Mission was on there.

1040
01:10:40,874 --> 01:10:41,854
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Impossible Mission.

1041
01:10:41,955 --> 01:10:43,275
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my mistake.

1042
01:10:43,315 --> 01:10:44,175
[SPEAKER_02]: That game's cool.

1043
01:10:44,235 --> 01:10:44,916
[SPEAKER_02]: You shut your mouth.

1044
01:10:44,996 --> 01:10:48,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, yes, such wonderful games as Chip's Challenge.

1045
01:10:48,357 --> 01:10:50,938
[SPEAKER_02]: Does anyone remember that from Windows 3.1?

1046
01:10:52,239 --> 01:10:53,039
[SPEAKER_02]: Command & Conquer.

1047
01:10:53,119 --> 01:10:53,999
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, that was a pretty good game.

1048
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:59,782
[SPEAKER_02]: Command & Conquer Red Alert, Descent, 2, 3, and Free Space.

1049
01:11:00,262 --> 01:11:01,982
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, all the Ultima games are going offline.

1050
01:11:02,283 --> 01:11:04,143
[SPEAKER_02]: Earthworm Jim, Earthworm Jim 2, Earthworm Jim 3D.

1051
01:11:08,047 --> 01:11:12,571
[SPEAKER_02]: Free Space 2, Impossible Mission 2, MDK.

1052
01:11:12,611 --> 01:11:13,532
[SPEAKER_02]: That was pretty good.

1053
01:11:14,413 --> 01:11:15,874
[SPEAKER_02]: C. Jerk.

1054
01:11:16,094 --> 01:11:16,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

1055
01:11:17,135 --> 01:11:18,997
[SPEAKER_02]: And then other games like Pajama Sam.

1056
01:11:19,057 --> 01:11:20,898
[SPEAKER_02]: Life is rough when you lose stuff.

1057
01:11:22,139 --> 01:11:24,922
[SPEAKER_02]: Or Pajama Sam.

1058
01:11:25,062 --> 01:11:27,404
[SPEAKER_02]: You are what you eat from your head to your feet.

1059
01:11:31,127 --> 01:11:31,768
[SPEAKER_02]: Pajama Sam.

1060
01:11:32,108 --> 01:11:33,889
[SPEAKER_02]: Games to play on any day.

1061
01:11:34,009 --> 01:11:34,430
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1062
01:11:35,919 --> 01:11:45,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, obviously, though, it's kind of sad, because some of those games, like, even you admit, MDK and some of that stuff is kind of cool, that the service is losing, and a lot of people are like, oh, no, why is GameTap deleting games?

1063
01:11:45,826 --> 01:11:50,350
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think the answer is probably just as simple as Time's Up, you know, they probably have these signed agreements.

1064
01:11:50,430 --> 01:11:52,391
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, actually, their licensing's up with that, you know.

1065
01:11:52,712 --> 01:11:54,093
[SPEAKER_02]: This will also make someone sad.

1066
01:11:54,153 --> 01:11:54,913
[SPEAKER_02]: American Deer Hunting 2000.

1067
01:11:55,013 --> 01:11:59,857
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, aren't all the games that are being pulled, like, most of them come from one or two different companies, right?

1068
01:11:59,897 --> 01:12:03,600
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, EA is one of them, and there's, I think, another one, and...

1069
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:08,923
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this probably just kind of screams that EA is probably going to do their own thing.

1070
01:12:09,744 --> 01:12:12,826
[SPEAKER_03]: Or EA is going to be signing a deal with somebody else soon where they're getting more money.

1071
01:12:12,966 --> 01:12:15,949
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the sim games are leaving, like SimTunes.

1072
01:12:15,989 --> 01:12:17,610
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't even realize there was a SimTunes.

1073
01:12:18,050 --> 01:12:25,916
[SPEAKER_02]: SimTower, SimSafari, SimPark, SimCity2000, SimCityClassic, Tetris.

1074
01:12:26,817 --> 01:12:27,057
[SPEAKER_02]: See?

1075
01:12:27,237 --> 01:12:28,218
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some good stuff leaving.

1076
01:12:29,079 --> 01:12:29,619
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

1077
01:12:30,300 --> 01:12:33,122
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, it's like winter games.

1078
01:12:34,702 --> 01:12:36,303
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well, we'll see what happens.

1079
01:12:36,343 --> 01:12:40,426
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows, maybe EA is going to be starting their own competing service soon, or... Damn it!

1080
01:12:40,466 --> 01:12:41,066
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody else, what?

1081
01:12:41,727 --> 01:12:44,949
[SPEAKER_03]: PuttPunzle's Fun Shop is gone!

1082
01:12:45,469 --> 01:12:46,690
[SPEAKER_03]: What am I going to play now?

1083
01:12:48,572 --> 01:12:57,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, I want to say, it kind of sucks for them because they just had this big brouhaha over, hooray, we hit our 1,000th game, and now losing these 70 games is going to put them back under 1,000.

1084
01:12:57,558 --> 01:13:01,981
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it would be funny if in January they say, we hit our 1,000th game again!

1085
01:13:03,442 --> 01:13:03,922
[SPEAKER_03]: They should.

1086
01:13:04,295 --> 01:13:05,336
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be hilarious.

1087
01:13:06,317 --> 01:13:06,638
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1088
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:09,361
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, let's...

1089
01:13:10,526 --> 01:13:11,547
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1090
01:13:35,248 --> 01:13:36,289
[SPEAKER_03]: The Game of the Week is Threads of Fate.

1091
01:14:00,097 --> 01:14:00,557
[SPEAKER_01]: Duprism Big Fat Axe

1092
01:14:23,838 --> 01:14:28,240
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, it's really, it actually had pretty good graphics for being an old PlayStation game.

1093
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:32,762
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really simple for how it played, but it was really fun.

1094
01:14:33,582 --> 01:14:40,965
[SPEAKER_01]: And I actually tried to play, I actually started playing through Duprism, and then when Threads of Fate came out, um, I had to just go out and get it.

1095
01:14:41,045 --> 01:14:44,487
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and I actually found my copy of it the other day, which made me think about it.

1096
01:14:45,107 --> 01:14:49,549
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just a really cool little game, and it had its own, um, pretty good following overseas, too.

1097
01:14:50,579 --> 01:15:02,027
[SPEAKER_01]: to the point where there was a fan version of a sequel called Duo Princess where you play as the Princess Mint and her sister Maya.

1098
01:15:02,227 --> 01:15:03,108
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was pretty good.

1099
01:15:06,090 --> 01:15:07,471
[SPEAKER_01]: I really just love this game.

1100
01:15:08,792 --> 01:15:18,139
[SPEAKER_01]: But it came out the same time that Vagrant Story, Legend of Mana, Chrono Cross, and Parasite 2 came out.

1101
01:15:18,739 --> 01:15:19,860
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's sort of

1102
01:15:21,260 --> 01:15:21,980
[SPEAKER_01]: Duprism Threads of Fate

1103
01:15:49,959 --> 01:15:51,359
[SPEAKER_03]: I did not play this game, but I should.

1104
01:15:51,599 --> 01:15:52,400
[SPEAKER_01]: You can borrow my copy.

1105
01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:54,440
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I played some of those other games you mentioned.

1106
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:58,681
[SPEAKER_03]: Wasn't that also the same time that horrible, horrible mana game came out on PSP?

1107
01:15:58,721 --> 01:16:00,421
[SPEAKER_01]: That was Legend of Mana.

1108
01:16:00,501 --> 01:16:01,722
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, God, that game was awful.

1109
01:16:02,022 --> 01:16:02,902
[SPEAKER_03]: I hated Legend of Mana.

1110
01:16:03,442 --> 01:16:08,363
[SPEAKER_01]: I have the Japanese version of Legend of Mana, and I was like, too much text.

1111
01:16:09,303 --> 01:16:10,523
[SPEAKER_01]: I read 30 kanji.

1112
01:16:10,624 --> 01:16:11,644
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't read this game.

1113
01:16:11,984 --> 01:16:12,384
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.

1114
01:16:12,624 --> 01:16:12,864
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1115
01:16:13,488 --> 01:16:17,450
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we're going to take a quick break and we're going to come back in a little bit with more of Orange Launch Radio.

1116
01:16:17,470 --> 01:16:19,392
[SPEAKER_03]: For those of you guys on the podcast, we'll be back in a couple days.

1117
01:16:19,692 --> 01:16:21,693
[SPEAKER_03]: For those of you guys listening live, we'll be back in a little bit.

1118
01:16:21,833 --> 01:16:24,815
[SPEAKER_03]: And Loki, for some reason, appears to be hooking up the Nintendo Wii.

1119
01:16:25,535 --> 01:16:26,756
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what the hell this is going to bring.

1120
01:16:27,696 --> 01:16:28,417
[SPEAKER_03]: Out here in studio.

1121
01:16:28,437 --> 01:16:30,038
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, Loki's going to play something during break.

1122
01:16:30,398 --> 01:16:33,020
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll be back in a little bit with more of Orange Launch Radio.

1123
01:16:34,621 --> 01:16:35,381
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so stay tuned.

1124
01:16:36,175 --> 01:16:41,141
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcasted to the world twice a week.

1125
01:16:41,621 --> 01:16:45,926
[SPEAKER_03]: Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
