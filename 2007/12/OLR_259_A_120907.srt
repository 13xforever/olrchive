00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,520
Tonight, December 9th, 2007, new details emerge on Street Fighter IV.

2
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:35,840
Nintendo gets a ninja party next year, and this game tap started removing games?

3
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:49,840
We are that gaming show, podcast, blogcast, Zoom cast, whatever you're into, thing dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

4
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,840
My name is Rob Roberts. Welcome back to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

5
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,840
Hi.

6
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,840
How are you doing, Jamie?

7
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,840
I'm almost full.

8
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,840
Yes, almost what you've been eating, of course, in traditional Jamie tradition.

9
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,840
I pick up my dinner on the way to the show.

10
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,840
That's good, that's good.

11
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,840
Otherwise, I would have just had beans.

12
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:08,840
I cram food in after the show before I go to bed, which is probably how I got fat.

13
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,840
It's not very healthy. You should not eat three hours before you go to bed.

14
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,840
It isn't, and then I shouldn't swim either.

15
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,840
I did nothing but eat.

16
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,840
So how was Alabama?

17
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,840
I did nothing but eat.

18
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,840
You did in Alabama, too? Good times.

19
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:35,840
I went to Alabama with sauce, and we stayed at my grandma's house and ate a lot of Blue Bell ice cream and watched a bunch of movies and had a Cracker Barrel in Waffle House.

20
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,840
Sounds very, very Jamie.

21
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,840
It was very delicious.

22
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,840
It was a very Jamie experience.

23
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,840
I had a delicious time.

24
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,840
Excellent.

25
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,840
All right, say hello as well to Tech Master, Loki.

26
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,840
Hello.

27
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,840
How are you doing, Loki?

28
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,840
Fine.

29
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,840
How are you enjoying the new studio, by the way, that we're taping in tonight?

30
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,840
It's big.

31
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,840
Yes, it's much more spacious than before.

32
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,840
It even comes complete with a washer and dryer that you can't see on the camera.

33
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,840
Yes.

34
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,840
For when I piss myself with joy, I can clean my clothes right there.

35
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,840
That's awesome.

36
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:10,840
Or, you know, when we have the, as somebody said earlier, on the cam, we covered a ladder with one of the blankets there to make it look a little better.

37
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:15,840
And somebody said something about we could use the ladder in having ladder matches during the show.

38
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:22,840
And I was saying, oh, we have, you know, cage matches and bra and panties matches and, you know, whipped cream and bananas.

39
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,840
Anyway.

40
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,840
Yeah.

41
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,840
Anyway, say hello as well to the one and only Puppy is here tonight joining us.

42
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,840
Hello.

43
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,840
How are you doing, Puppy?

44
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:38,840
I'm worn out from school and work, but I'm getting by and I'm playing lots of rock band and my right leg is cramping.

45
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,840
Well, now hold on.

46
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,840
Don't spoil your gaming weeks just yet.

47
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,840
Whoops.

48
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,840
Maybe it's that you're angsty that your right leg is cramping so much.

49
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,840
All sorts of errors tonight in the brand new studio.

50
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,840
Do you like our new digs?

51
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,840
It's much more spacious than that previous box.

52
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,840
It is much more spacious than the previous box.

53
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,840
Although, Loki still has the same table that wobbles.

54
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,840
I think as somebody said...

55
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,840
I used to have the overturned laundry basket.

56
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,840
Now I have the wobbly table.

57
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,840
I'm moving up in line.

58
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,840
Independent radio at its finest.

59
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,840
Somebody was saying earlier when I was doing the tests earlier today and somebody was watching,

60
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,840
they said all I need is a little mini bar back there and we would truly be an orange lounge.

61
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,840
It would be fun.

62
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,840
We'll see.

63
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,840
A mini bar would be nice.

64
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,840
I'll bring some vodka.

65
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,840
How about something that's orange?

66
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,840
That also might help, too.

67
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,840
Since there's absolutely no orange in there.

68
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,840
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

69
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,840
Penguin nose and chocobo nose.

70
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,840
But you can't really see those because the camera's being blocked by the job.

71
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,840
Yeah, a little ways away.

72
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,840
Anyway, let's get into enough talking about our new digs.

73
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,840
Let's talk about our gaming weeks.

74
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,840
First, Sakura, why don't you start us off?

75
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,840
How was your gaming week?

76
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,840
Well, I played a lot of Ragnarok.

77
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:46,840
Now that I have internet again, I missed it.

78
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,840
I have a character at level 97 now.

79
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,840
That was really awesome.

80
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:57,840
While I was in Alabama, I didn't play crap except on the airplane where I tried to play some Oendan

81
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,840
and totally irritated this guy sitting next to me.

82
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,840
It was fantastic.

83
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,840
That's great.

84
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,840
I did that when I still had it when I was in classes in between breaks.

85
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,840
People would be looking at me like, what the hell is that tapping noise you're doing?

86
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,840
I had my headphones on, and he was just looking at me like a...

87
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:18,840
Oh, but on the way back, this is cool.

88
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:21,840
When I got on the little dinky tiny plane...

89
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:22,840
No, I take that back.

90
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,840
It was when I got on the bigger plane coming out of Dallas.

91
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,840
These guys were sitting behind me like, oh, well, don't mind us.

92
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,840
We're nerds, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

93
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,840
I was like, okay.

94
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:40,840
Then for some reason, we started talking about Half-Life, which I can't play Half-Life.

95
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,840
I was like, yeah, I'm going to get Portal anyway, but I'm going to be so motion sick.

96
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,840
They're like, you get motion sick, and you're on an airplane.

97
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,840
I was like, only video games make me motion sick.

98
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,840
I'm sure that guards them.

99
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,840
That and riding in the backseat of a car will do it sometimes.

100
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,840
Or riding in Kristen's car on Highway 1.

101
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,840
Yeah, that was my gaming week.

102
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,840
All right.

103
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,840
We have a Black Knight pinball in our house now.

104
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,840
Not a Black Knight 2000.

105
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,840
We are housing somebody's Black Knight.

106
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,840
What does that mean?

107
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,840
You're borrowing?

108
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:15,840
We're providing them storage space in exchange for massive amounts of playing it.

109
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,840
All righty.

110
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,840
Well, let's go over to the one and only Loki.

111
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,840
How was your gaming week, Loki?

112
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,840
Not as filled as I thought it would be, unfortunately.

113
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,840
I planned to play a lot of things and never got around to it.

114
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,840
But I played more Zelda fandom Hourglass.

115
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,840
Almost done with that.

116
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,840
See, the thing with Zelda games is when you finish them, you don't want to play them again.

117
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,840
You're just like, you're done.

118
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,840
Anyways...

119
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,840
I don't know about that.

120
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,840
I challenge that statement because I can still go back and play the old Super Nintendo one.

121
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,840
And the old school NES ones I still love too.

122
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,840
Yeah, true.

123
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,840
Like the Super Nintendo ones and stuff.

124
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,840
I think this game is a little bit shorter.

125
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,840
I mean, it seemed to be really short versus, you know...

126
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,840
Maybe you're just that good.

127
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,840
No, the game is really fucking easy.

128
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,840
It's like stupid easy.

129
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,840
But, I don't know.

130
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,840
It's just...

131
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,840
It's okay, I guess.

132
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,840
Saints Row actually went back and started playing the single player stuff.

133
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,840
Not really...

134
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,840
Now, I haven't really been playing the single player stuff.

135
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,840
I've been playing single player but I've been blowing up this armored car over and over and over again.

136
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:25,840
Because there's a trick where you can keep getting more money because I'm trying to get the achievement for a million dollars.

137
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,840
And so I keep doing that.

138
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,840
But it's entertaining nonetheless because you're blowing up cars over and over.

139
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,840
Achievement whore.

140
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,840
But, we've been switching it up at work instead of all rocket matches now.

141
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:42,840
Now we're doing shotguns, pimp slap, and grenades in the meter maid cars.

142
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,840
It's hilarious because...

143
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,840
Boy, that sounds like a party.

144
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,840
Pimp slaps and grenades in the meter maid cars.

145
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,840
But you don't understand.

146
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,840
That's like a band name.

147
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,840
In Saints Row, the pimp slap is like a one hit kill.

148
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,840
You just smack somebody and it launches them across the entire arena.

149
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,840
It's actually pretty fun.

150
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,840
But now we're switching it up.

151
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:03,840
We're moving out of the arena into this parking garage because there's a thousand more meter maid cars everywhere.

152
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,840
It's hilarious.

153
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,840
And then, let's see, what else have I been playing?

154
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,840
I played the Golden Compass on the Wii.

155
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,840
That sucked.

156
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,840
360, I played Dance Dance Revolution Universe 2.

157
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:22,840
It's fucking DDR.

158
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:27,840
It's exactly the same as Universe 1 to me.

159
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,840
They've changed a few things.

160
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:35,840
The quest mode, you're no longer moving around the United States and the world and stuff.

161
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,840
It's now this fictional DDR island shit.

162
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,840
I don't know.

163
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,840
But is it broken still like the first quest mode was?

164
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,840
Or did they actually kind of fix that?

165
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:52,840
I would say it's 80% broken still instead of 100% broken as before.

166
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,840
The song list is okay.

167
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,840
I still hate the fact that I have to play through quest mode in order to unlock songs.

168
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,840
I find that very annoying.

169
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,840
But, I mean, it's okay. It's DDR.

170
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,840
Luckily, I didn't have to buy it.

171
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:12,840
That's good because right now the only way they're selling it is with the dance pad.

172
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,840
You have to pay lots of money for that.

173
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,840
If you're interested in picking it up, it is coming out in January.

174
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,840
Game by itself.

175
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,840
And about the same time we'll be getting a DDR Disney Channel edition.

176
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,840
Which is probably going to be crap.

177
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,840
But that's okay.

178
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,840
But high school musical songs to DDR2.

179
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,840
Okay. Yeah. Lame.

180
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:40,840
Let's see. What else did I play this week?

181
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,840
You know, I think that's about it.

182
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,840
Because, really, I haven't had a chance to play a lot of stuff.

183
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:50,840
In fact, I bought two games yesterday and I haven't even unwrapped them yet.

184
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:56,840
I've got Contra IV and Final Fantasy XII Revenant Wings for when I finish Zelda.

185
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,840
Which will be very soon.

186
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,840
I don't know. All the extra stuff in Zelda.

187
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,840
All the hidden islands and stuff.

188
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,840
They have an island that looks like a DS.

189
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,840
And I was like, oh, that's kind of funny.

190
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,840
And that was about the extent of my interest in that.

191
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:12,840
And then there's another island that you can find treasure.

192
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,840
Which is really kind of lame.

193
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:19,840
It's not like Wind Waker was where it kind of felt like Mega Man Legends to me a little bit.

194
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:24,840
Where there's a lot of exploring of, you know, a ton of different dungeons and stuff.

195
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:29,840
This game, I don't know, it's just kind of really scaled down and made the hell lot easier.

196
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,840
So, I have to go back and play Wind Waker again.

197
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,840
Because I never did finish that game.

198
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,840
And then maybe eventually I'll warm up to playing Twilight Princess.

199
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:41,840
But, I don't know. I just don't like it.

200
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,840
Alright, fine.

201
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,840
Alright, then my gaming week.

202
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,840
There was some new stuff I finally got to play this week.

203
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,840
As opposed to the same old MMOs.

204
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,840
I actually didn't play the MMOs so much this week.

205
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,840
I actually checked out some new stuff.

206
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,840
Including the orange box, finally.

207
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,840
Which is magnificent.

208
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,840
There's several different games in there.

209
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,840
I haven't even gotten to touch Team Fortress 2 yet.

210
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,840
But I've been playing some of the other games in there.

211
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,840
Half Life, which to be honest,

212
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,840
I know it's a critically acclaimed game and everything.

213
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,840
But I just never really got the chance to play it before.

214
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,840
So this is really the first chance I'm getting to play Half Life.

215
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,840
Half Life 2, I mean, of course.

216
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,840
It's kind of cool. It's very immersive.

217
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,840
And of course, Portal.

218
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,840
I've been playing a lot of Portal.

219
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,840
Moving through the game rather quickly,

220
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,840
I guess the game really isn't that long, per se.

221
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,840
But it'd be damned if it isn't pretty funny and pretty innovative.

222
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,840
It's a great kind of...

223
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,840
It's a puzzle game in first person.

224
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,840
It's not a first person shooter. It's a first person puzzler.

225
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,840
I don't know what else to call it. It's pretty cool.

226
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,840
I swear to God though, that whole thing where you have to

227
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,840
fire a portal on the ground,

228
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,840
and then fire together half up on the ceiling,

229
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,840
and then fall from the ceiling to the one on the ground to get enough inertia,

230
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,840
that thing drove me frickin' nuts.

231
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,840
I was trying to do that for like an hour.

232
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,840
It was so difficult that I finally got through that.

233
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:00,840
Let's see. Also, the other game I've been playing is

234
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,840
Geometry Wars Galaxies I picked up on the Nintendo Wii.

235
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:07,840
And I'm having quite a bit of fun with Geometry Wars Galaxies.

236
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,840
It's a pretty good time.

237
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:13,840
It's a lot different than just the game on the Xbox.

238
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:17,840
On the good side, there's a lot of extra types of stages,

239
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,840
more monsters, and you know what?

240
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,840
The controls are actually not as hokey as you'd think.

241
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:26,840
Like, you know, you have to use one half is the moving around.

242
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:30,840
You move around with the nunchuck on one,

243
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:34,840
and then you use the Wiimote to kind of point on the screen where you want to shoot.

244
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,840
And you'd think that would be really hokey,

245
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,840
but it actually works out really well.

246
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:42,840
So, I actually kind of enjoyed the control scheme.

247
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:46,840
And plus, if for whatever reason you don't like that control scheme,

248
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,840
you can do the classic controller, which is great.

249
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:52,840
Classic controller doesn't feel quite as nice as the Xbox 360 controller did,

250
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:56,840
and I think it's because the directionals are a little more grooved on the Wii,

251
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:01,840
whereas the Xbox 360 has the full 360 degrees of movement a little bit.

252
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:05,840
So I think that it doesn't have quite the same feel with the classic controller, but it's nice.

253
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:09,840
My only minor complaints about the game is that, A, it looks better on the 360, obviously.

254
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:15,840
I mean, you can tell there's some graphical dumbing down that had to be done for the Wii,

255
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,840
but it doesn't look bad.

256
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,840
I mean, it is Geometry Wars.

257
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:22,840
You're not going to expect, you know, the world's best-looking game,

258
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,840
you know, when you're looking at that.

259
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:29,840
And then also, the other only kind of minor complaint I have is that,

260
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:33,840
you know, it's kind of cool that you progress through these different levels

261
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,840
and you unlock new planets and you unlock new power-ups,

262
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,840
because the other kind of thing that you have in Geometry Wars Galaxies,

263
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:42,840
you have a little droid that follows you, and you can tell the droid what to do.

264
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:46,840
Like, you can buy an attack mode or buy a defend,

265
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,840
and as you play more levels, the droid levels up with you.

266
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,840
And it's kind of cool, so it gets a little smarter.

267
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:57,840
But the only thing is that there's really no method to that progression, if that makes sense.

268
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,840
Like, there's no story to back it up.

269
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,840
There's really no nothing.

270
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,840
And, you know, I can kind of understand it,

271
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,840
because Geometry Wars Galaxies is supposed to feel like an arcade game,

272
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,840
especially like a classic 80s shooter, and it does that very well.

273
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:14,840
But then I think, you know, even Pac-Man at least had the little cutscenes every three boards

274
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,840
that kept it kind of, like, entertaining.

275
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:21,840
There isn't really anything that you feel like you're working for, if that makes sense.

276
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,840
So, that was my only minor complaint, but overall, I think the game's great.

277
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,840
You don't think cutscenes in Geometry Wars?

278
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,840
I don't mean, like, you have to, like, have these grand, like, cutscenes,

279
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,840
but, like, give me a reason for kind of, like, unlocking all these things.

280
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,840
Or, you know, just a little bit of a story wouldn't hurt.

281
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,840
You know what I mean?

282
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:43,840
What they need to do is take Geometry Wars out of, like, just the normal, like, asteroid kind of stuff,

283
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:48,840
and make it into, like, a shoot-em-up game, like Gradius or something like that.

284
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,840
That would be fun.

285
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,840
Yeah, it might be fun.

286
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:55,840
The other cool thing about Geometry Wars I thought was really cool is that you can download the demo of,

287
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:59,840
well, it's not really the demo of galaxies to your DS.

288
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,840
It's just basically retro-evolved.

289
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:04,840
You can download to your DS from the Wii, which is kind of cool,

290
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,840
but I do not like the way the DS controls it all.

291
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:12,840
So, I don't really want the game on DS, because you use the stylus on the bottom to control your firing,

292
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,840
and it just, it's not that that really bothers me.

293
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,840
It's the trying to move around with the directional pad.

294
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,840
You know, a DS only has the up, down, left, right, really.

295
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:25,840
The 360 degrees of movement, which is so important in Geometry Wars, is kind of lost on the DS.

296
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,840
But overall, I liked galaxies.

297
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:31,840
It was fun, and I think it's a good game to kind of play, like, in short little segments,

298
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,840
just like an old, you know, 80s arcade shooter.

299
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,840
So, Puppey, anything you want to share about your gaming week?

300
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,840
A couple of things.

301
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:42,840
I've been whoring out Rock Band a ton ever since I got it.

302
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:50,840
I had to switch back to my Guitar Hero 3 controller, because the strum bar on my Rock Band controller died,

303
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:54,840
and I sent out for the warranty on that, and it actually came back already.

304
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:58,840
It only took three days for me to get the replacement, and I sent the other one back.

305
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:04,840
And then, other than that, I got Gamefly, so I've been renting games lately.

306
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:10,840
I wanted to rent Mass Effect, Call of Duty 4, Orange Box,

307
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:16,840
and for, I guess I had put Dead Rising on my list a long time ago and forgot about it,

308
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,840
and they ended up sending me that instead.

309
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:23,840
I played it for a total of an hour and a half, and sent it back.

310
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,840
I could not stand that game for some reason.

311
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,840
It was just terrible.

312
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:33,840
I thought it was great, because you could, you know, hit zombies with a scythe or a lawnmower.

313
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:38,840
Well, that was entertaining, but the story could have been cooler,

314
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,840
but the way they've got the game set up, you can only save it once,

315
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:46,840
and if you die, you have to go back very far and reload a bunch of crap.

316
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:54,840
I just got sick of it very quickly, and I would not have played through the entire game.

317
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,840
Is that it?

318
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:03,840
Rock Band, Dead Rising, not playing Halo again until the maps come out next week.

319
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,840
Yeah, that's pretty much it.

320
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:10,840
Going to the chat room, our always-present other guests, chat.orangelawnsradio.com,

321
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:14,840
they're kind of lit up right now, because our live 365 stream has been going up and down,

322
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,840
which has been kind of one unfortunate side effect of the new studio,

323
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:21,840
is that the wireless router now is kind of on the other corner of the house,

324
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,840
so I think I've been losing signal a little bit.

325
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,840
I don't know if Op11 is interfering with that.

326
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:28,840
So what I'll probably have to do next week is we'll probably get a little sub-router,

327
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,840
because we have a giant cord that we run out here for Operator 11.

328
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,840
I'll also have to get something to split that signal.

329
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,840
But yet, Jamie and Loki's computers run fine on the wireless network.

330
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,840
I don't know what that is, but then again, they're not trying to broadcast a radio program from that.

331
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,840
So I apologize, chat room, if live 365 is going up and down,

332
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,840
we'll just kind of have to deal with it tonight, and then next week we'll fix that.

333
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:50,840
But now we know, which is weird, because I ran live 365 and Op11 at the same time

334
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,840
for 40 minutes earlier today, and everything was fine,

335
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,840
but now, of course, we're having a plethora of problems.

336
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,840
Just my luck.

337
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:59,840
And people will continuously bitch about it.

338
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,840
Actually, I'm not really sure why.

339
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:04,840
Well, I think it might just be because of the way your wireless is set up

340
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:07,840
versus having a wireless card built in.

341
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,840
Possibly. I don't know. Because I have the little USB thing?

342
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,840
Possibly. Who knows.

343
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,840
Well, we'll see what happens. We'll do our best.

344
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,840
Anyway, we've got to keep the show moving,

345
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,840
because of course we've got lots of people who listen to this in the podcast form,

346
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:23,840
and they don't understand any of this that they're hearing right now.

347
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:26,840
They're like, what are you talking about, this wireless router and stuff?

348
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:29,840
Live 365 and chat room, what is all that about?

349
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:34,840
Anyhow, I was going to talk about one more thing that I played this week.

350
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,840
Well, alrighty.

351
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:40,840
And I'm not sure, I can't remember if we're getting into this later on or not,

352
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:47,840
but anyways, there's an independent games festival thing

353
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,840
kind of going on right now that they've got some of the finalists for.

354
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,840
I think the awards come up later in our show.

355
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,840
Yeah, the awards. The 10th Annual Independent Games Festival.

356
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:00,840
Anyways, I was playing some of the finalists for that,

357
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,840
and one of the games I played, Clean Asia,

358
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,840
which I'm a huge fan of Warning Forever and stuff like that.

359
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,840
Very similar style game.

360
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,840
Very cool shoot-em-up, you've got to try that.

361
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,840
Also, Cran Physics is another funny one.

362
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,840
But they've got some other stuff in there as well,

363
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,840
including a game that I talked about before.

364
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,840
What was it? Let's see here.

365
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,840
Fret Nice was another one of the nominees,

366
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:28,840
which is a pretty fun game to play on the PC with the Guitar Hero controller.

367
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:31,840
Well, tell us more about that when we get to that part of the show.

368
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,840
Will do.

369
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,840
Rob, I have a question about your gaming week.

370
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:35,840
Sure.

371
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,840
Did you make it past that part in Portal?

372
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,840
I sure did. I got to the next level in Portal.

373
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:45,840
I was venting with Jamie my frustration at the robots that shoot you a bunch and then you die.

374
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,840
I was having a hard time getting through that portion,

375
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,840
and then Jamie said, you have to shoot the ceiling.

376
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,840
And she showed me this little walkthrough she'd been watching on the internet.

377
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,840
I'm like, God damn it, I didn't even think to shoot the damn ceiling and drop bricks on them.

378
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,840
I was trying to shoot the floor and shoot them out through the floor,

379
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:03,840
but there's one part where you can't because the floor is the type where you can't build portals.

380
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,840
And I was just taking the cube and trying to bowl them over.

381
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,840
That's how I was doing it.

382
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,840
And it worked for a minute.

383
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,840
You can use the camera too.

384
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,840
People are using the cameras.

385
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,840
But I felt bad for Rob.

386
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,840
I watched the walkthrough a bajillion times just because I thought it was funny.

387
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,840
And so I had to help.

388
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,840
That's right.

389
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,840
So now I'm to the next stage in Portal.

390
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,840
I just kind of quit for the night because I wanted to play some other stuff,

391
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,840
so I had new things to talk about tonight.

392
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,840
Anyhow, a little bit of housekeeping.

393
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,840
I guess I already talked about the parts about the new studio,

394
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,840
and unfortunately the effect it's having on us tonight with the whole live stream cutting in and out.

395
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,840
Sorry about that.

396
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,840
But we'll hopefully fix that within the next couple weeks.

397
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,840
Are we doing a show December 23rd?

398
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,840
I don't think we talked about that.

399
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,840
It's the Christmas week.

400
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,840
Here it is for Christmas.

401
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,840
I should be available.

402
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,840
Yeah, I think I'll probably be here too.

403
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,840
But I have to work Monday.

404
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,840
And of course we have our year-end show coming.

405
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:03,840
You have to work on Christmas Eve?

406
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,840
Yeah.

407
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:05,840
Sorry about that.

408
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,840
I work for, you know, freakin' tyrants, so it's okay.

409
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:14,840
We'll be having our year-end special probably on December 30th,

410
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:19,840
and I'm hoping that we get some guests on the program like we did last year,

411
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:20,840
but more on that in the next couple weeks.

412
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,840
Let's get to the gaming news.

413
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:23,840
Enough about the housekeeping stuff.

414
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,840
Let's start off Loki tonight.

415
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,840
Anyways, I just wanted to comment one thing on the chat room.

416
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,840
Everyone's talking about the weighted companion cube and stuff.

417
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,840
No one ever mentions the weighted companion sphere

418
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,840
that happens to be in the challenge mode of the game.

419
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,840
No love for the sphere, I guess.

420
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,840
What's the difference between the sphere and the cube?

421
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,840
One's round and one's cube.

422
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,840
Does the computer call it the weighted companion sphere?

423
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,840
I don't know.

424
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:50,840
Well, I think all that stuff's still the same,

425
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:54,840
but it's just it's harder because you can't just drop it and it will roll.

426
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,840
Oh, that's right.

427
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,840
And you can't jump on top of it as easy because it'll roll.

428
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,840
Okay, I get it.

429
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,840
I'm like, duh, I know one's a sphere and a cube, dumbass.

430
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,840
I'm like, what is the effect that that has?

431
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,840
Okay, I get it.

432
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,840
I know the sphere does not have any hearts on it.

433
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,840
Aw, sadness.

434
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,840
So it doesn't really like you.

435
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,840
It's just pretending.

436
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,840
Well, then why throw that thing in the incinerator like that?

437
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:15,840
It's like challenge mode, okay.

438
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:20,840
Anyways, this week Rockstar happened to throw out on the internet

439
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,840
a brand new trailer for Grand Theft Auto IV.

440
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,840
It's fucking fantastic.

441
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:25,840
It's called Move Up, Ladies.

442
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,840
It's basically what's really important about this trailer, though,

443
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,840
compared to the last one, which came out about six months ago,

444
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:36,840
is it looks a lot better than, you know, the game has really progressed.

445
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:40,840
But it did show kind of a lot of the detail that they're adding in there,

446
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:44,840
including, you know, gunfights and all the stuff that you'd expect

447
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,840
from Grand Theft Auto.

448
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,840
But there's a bunch of new screenshots and stuff.

449
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,840
I have to say the game is coming along very well.

450
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:51,840
It looks awesome.

451
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,840
And I think a lot of people that were kind of hesitating about the game

452
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,840
before saying, oh, this is just going to be crap,

453
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,840
were really on board with it.

454
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:01,840
But if you want to check it out, it's pretty much everywhere.

455
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,840
All the major sites, Xbox Live, PlayStation Network,

456
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:08,840
you can definitely find it and download.

457
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:09,840
All righty.

458
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:13,840
So does it actually show, like, more than just the cut scenes?

459
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,840
Like, do you actually see what the game is?

460
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,840
I still, all the cut scenes are with the in-game engine.

461
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:22,840
So, I mean, you essentially see what the game looks like.

462
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:26,840
One of the characters that they showed also was, again,

463
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,840
going to be voiced, I guess, by Seth Green.

464
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,840
So that was kind of funny.

465
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,840
But it looks really cool.

466
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,840
I like the trailers.

467
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,840
I just can't wait for the game to come out.

468
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,840
I hope it comes out actually in April, like it's supposed to.

469
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,840
All right.

470
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:43,840
Anyhow, let's move on to another story about Sony.

471
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,840
And, of course, the Sony iBo.

472
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,840
You've got to love the iBo, the little doggy.

473
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,840
I thought they discontinued the iBo.

474
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:53,840
You know, I guess they did discontinue the iBo that's out now,

475
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,840
but it's because there's another iBo on the way, apparently,

476
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,840
at least if Stuff Magazine is to be believed.

477
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,840
They're currently running a rumor that there is the new iBo

478
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:08,840
that's going to interface with the PSP and the PlayStation 3.

479
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,840
I guess the reason why they're doing this

480
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:15,840
is to kind of give the PlayStation 3 more toys and cool stuff,

481
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,840
so that it's not just the eye of judgment that they have,

482
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,840
but that they have the iBo as well.

483
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:24,840
So apparently the iBo is going to have its own avatar.

484
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,840
You'll actually see it within Home, Sony Home.

485
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,840
It'll actually do things in the real world like it does in Sony's Home,

486
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,840
which should be kind of interesting.

487
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,840
So apparently you're going to be able to download new personalities

488
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,840
for the iBo from PlayStation Network,

489
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:42,840
and you're going to be able to use the PSP with it over Wi-Fi.

490
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:47,840
The little camera in the dog's head will actually also show on your PSP screen.

491
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,840
So what you could actually do is you could move your dog around

492
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,840
and put it right under ladies' skirts and then use the PSP as an upskirt cam.

493
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,840
So when girls go, oh, what a cute, fake doggy.

494
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,840
That's probably the reasoning why they put it in Stuff Magazine to begin with.

495
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,840
Possibly.

496
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:07,840
I wanted to get one so I could play with my cat,

497
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,840
because my cat's kind of getting lonely and she's causing a lot of trouble,

498
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:13,840
and I figured this would be a perfect way to spend a couple thousand dollars

499
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,840
is to get a thing to play with my cat.

500
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,840
Then I could also watch it at work and watch what my cat's doing.

501
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,840
Now here's my favorite part,

502
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:27,840
Stuff Magazine rates this rumor at a 53% possibility.

503
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,840
Where the fuck do you get a number like that?

504
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,840
It makes it sound like there's this real scientific process

505
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:38,840
that rumors go through over at Stuff Magazine in order to get a rating.

506
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:42,840
So it's like they put it in their big super-predicting computer.

507
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,840
Here's a little note.

508
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,840
This has a 53% probability of being true.

509
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:53,840
It's about as official as the if they mated segment of Conan, okay?

510
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,840
We'll see. I don't know. I kind of call BS.

511
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:59,840
I think there may be a little something with the eyebo,

512
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,840
but I don't know, upskirt cams, I don't know about that.

513
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,840
We don't need to be giving Sony any ideas.

514
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,840
I want an eyebo, Rob.

515
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,840
Okay, well, save up your money and then you can buy one.

516
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,840
I've wanted an eyebo for a very long time.

517
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,840
I have a live journal icon that's an eyebo.

518
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:14,840
I want a pony.

519
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:15,840
You know what?

520
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,840
I'm not exactly to get a pony.

521
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,840
Eyebo of judgment.

522
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,840
The eyebo of judgment.

523
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,840
They should make the eye pony.

524
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,840
I was watching a special on robotics last night

525
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,840
and they were bringing up the eyebo.

526
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:31,840
But it was these lifelike robot people,

527
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,840
things that could interview people and repeat back your question

528
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,840
and follow you and do all this stuff.

529
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,840
I was like, yet the eyebo didn't sell better.

530
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,840
Eye paparazzi?

531
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,840
It was called like the respond queue or something, it was really weird.

532
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,840
It was at one of the Tokyo robotics shows I was watching.

533
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:53,840
Anyway, for anyone who is interested in Devil May Cry 4,

534
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:58,840
which I know I am because I really, really, really, really, really, really like Devil May Cry,

535
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:02,840
except why the hell are they giving Dante a beard?

536
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:06,840
The demo is going to be out in early 2008, according to Capcom.

537
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:10,840
For PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, there will be a PC version,

538
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,840
but no word on if we're getting a demo of that.

539
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:16,840
And the demo is supposed to be different levels in the game

540
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:19,840
instead of just, oh, here's the start of the game, bye.

541
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:23,840
It's to give you a sample of the environments and different characters.

542
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,840
See, now I worry about you having an eyebo

543
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:30,840
because the fangasm you have when you play this Devil May Cry demo

544
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,840
will get all over your eyebo, and that's just filthy.

545
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,840
No.

546
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:37,840
No.

547
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,840
Will you at least put a towel over your eyebo so he doesn't have to watch?

548
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:43,840
I wouldn't get an eyebo anyway because you know my cat would be offended.

549
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,840
Miss Stupid Shermy Butt.

550
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,840
Shermy's been replaced with a robot?

551
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,840
No.

552
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:49,840
Okay.

553
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,840
She gets offended when I bring new people into the house.

554
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:53,840
She gets used to them.

555
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,840
How exactly does a cat get offended?

556
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:56,840
That's what I want to know.

557
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,840
You know how some cats just get pissy and walk off and everything?

558
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:02,840
Shermy just gives me this hurt look.

559
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:03,840
I don't know how else to describe it.

560
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,840
She doesn't get pissy.

561
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,840
She doesn't, like, start hissing at anybody.

562
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,840
She just looks hurt.

563
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,840
That's why I'm a dog person.

564
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:14,840
We've secretly replaced Shermy with an eyebo.

565
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:20,840
My cat's so retarded, she still thinks that the mirror is another cat, so, you know.

566
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:23,840
I was watching on YouTube last night, though, along with the robotic stuff,

567
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:28,840
I was also watching cats talking to people, you know, that could imitate human talk,

568
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:31,840
and Shermy was going crazy.

569
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,840
She was running into the desk.

570
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:38,840
She gets unnatural!

571
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:41,840
What in God's name is going on over there?

572
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,840
That's what it sounded like, actually.

573
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:43,840
Wow.

574
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,840
You don't understand.

575
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,840
We're kind of crazy with our cat.

576
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:50,840
We'll make her talk, like, and we'll have conversations with her,

577
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:55,840
but she can't talk, and I don't know why the hell we do that.

578
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,840
And she has a really high-pitched voice somehow.

579
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,840
I don't know.

580
00:27:58,840 --> 00:27:59,840
It's weird.

581
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:00,840
One of the videos I was watching last night,

582
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:04,840
it just sounded like the cat was actually just, like, saying,

583
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,840
Hello?

584
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:07,840
Hello?

585
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,840
Like that.

586
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:09,840
And I was like, okay.

587
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:13,840
And then another one was a cat sleeping in a sink.

588
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,840
Is this where Lolcats is going in 2008?

589
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:17,840
I don't know.

590
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:18,840
I think so.

591
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:19,840
Wow.

592
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,840
Okay.

593
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:21,840
Let's move on.

594
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,840
Anyways.

595
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:25,840
So, yes.

596
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:30,840
One of the unfortunate things with the PlayStation 3 version of Rock Band

597
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,840
was that you couldn't use your Guitar Hero 3 controller with it.

598
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,840
Well, now that's going to be fixed,

599
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,840
and there is going to be a patch that's going to be coming

600
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:42,840
where you'll be able to download it, and it will allow it to play.

601
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,840
Hooray!

602
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:44,840
That's kind of funny, though,

603
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:48,840
is they had another story that came out earlier this week.

604
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:53,840
Some guy, Red Octane, was actually making fun of Rock Band

605
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,840
and their guitar controllers and saying how they're never going to make

606
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,840
those controllers compatible with Guitar Hero 3

607
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:01,840
because they think their controllers are crap.

608
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,840
Way to take the high road, Red Octane.

609
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:08,840
You know, hey, it doesn't matter that our consumers or anything

610
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,840
might want it a little bit easier so they don't have to buy more

611
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,840
of your crappy controllers.

612
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,840
Sure, let's just go ahead and piss on them.

613
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,840
Hooray!

614
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:22,840
I do like, though, that they're at least patching to, you know,

615
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,840
like somebody's giving in a little bit and patching

616
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,840
so the guitars work universally.

617
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:27,840
Exactly, they should.

618
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,840
I don't understand why they lock it out of other games.

619
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,840
It's just fucking lazy.

620
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,840
Actually, it's just fucking mean is what it is.

621
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,840
Jonathan F. in our chat room has a good point that

622
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,840
I don't believe we're covering elsewhere on our show tonight.

623
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,840
He says, speaking of patches,

624
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:43,840
Guitar Hero Wii discs will be replaced in 2008

625
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,840
to fix the mono sound problem.

626
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:46,840
Did you hear about that?

627
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:47,840
Yeah.

628
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,840
So they're going to remaster the discs or whatever,

629
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,840
and they'll be available in 2008 new discs.

630
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,840
But how many people do you think will actually do that?

631
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,840
I bet most Wii owners probably wouldn't even think to do it.

632
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,840
There might be a few.

633
00:29:58,840 --> 00:29:59,840
Well, we need to spread the word.

634
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,840
Make it financially sucky for them.

635
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:03,840
Well, there you have it.

636
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,840
If you own Guitar Hero on the Wii,

637
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,840
then be sure in 2008 you request your...

638
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,840
And even if you don't care, just get a new one anyway,

639
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,840
just because newer is better.

640
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:13,840
That's what you need to remember.

641
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,840
Newer is better.

642
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:15,840
That's right.

643
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:16,840
Newer is better.

644
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:19,840
Moving on, we're talking about the PlayStation a little bit,

645
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,840
and on the PlayStation Network, it has been released this week,

646
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:25,840
a brand new bowling game.

647
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,840
High velocity bowling is $10.

648
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:31,840
Also added to the PlayStation Network,

649
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,840
some new stuff for the game Folklore,

650
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,840
and of course, Rock Band downloadable content.

651
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:39,840
Also, Wild Arms is now available for download

652
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,840
on the old school PlayStation Games line.

653
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,840
Yay!

654
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,840
So, I don't know.

655
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:52,840
It's certainly not Wii bowling, but it kind of looks a little urban.

656
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,840
You play a guy with tattoos.

657
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,840
You actually use the 6-axis controller.

658
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,840
Yeah, I was kind of curious about that.

659
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,840
Yeah, we're going to have people throw...

660
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:04,840
See though, I don't know if this one would be making holes in TVs and stuff,

661
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,840
because it's kind of rounded and a little bit light,

662
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,840
whereas when you kind of huck the remote,

663
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,840
it's kind of like a javelin type thing.

664
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,840
Just get the Nerf thing for it.

665
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:13,840
That's what you do.

666
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,840
Yeah, you just get the Nerf thing for it.

667
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:22,840
Well, in other news for our PlayStation 3 owners,

668
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:25,840
which at Best Buy, that was freaking sad.

669
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,840
Oh yes, Jamie and I went to Best Buy earlier this week,

670
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,840
and we were shopping.

671
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:31,840
We were just kind of going around.

672
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,840
Sad.

673
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,840
That's when I bought Geometry Wars Galaxies.

674
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:35,840
Yes.

675
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,840
I was thinking about getting Trauma Center,

676
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,840
and I ended up getting the cheaper of the game.

677
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,840
And I bought Super Breakout for the Atari 5200 that night.

678
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:42,840
But that was later.

679
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,840
But I already own two copies of it.

680
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,840
Then why did you buy a third, dummy?

681
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,840
I thought that we didn't have it,

682
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,840
and then it occurred to me when we got home

683
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,840
that freaking Super Breakout was the game

684
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:57,840
that came with the Atari 5200.

685
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,840
But I have a manual now.

686
00:31:58,840 --> 00:31:59,840
That's good.

687
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:00,840
All right.

688
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,840
Well, anyhow, I was going to say at Best Buy,

689
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:06,840
we were there, and there were big stacks of PlayStation 3s

690
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,840
all over the store, not just one stack,

691
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:11,840
but at least four stacks of PlayStation 3s.

692
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:16,840
There were easily, what, 50 systems just sitting out unloved?

693
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,840
And we were talking to the guy,

694
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,840
because the guy was helping me look up Geometry Wars Galaxies,

695
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:21,840
because for whatever reason,

696
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:22,840
they didn't have any out on the floor.

697
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:23,840
They were all in the cage.

698
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,840
So I was asking him if they had it and everything.

699
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,840
And you could tell he was kind of a gamer,

700
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:27,840
so we were kind of joking with him,

701
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,840
and he said something about he was playing Geometry Wars on a 360.

702
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,840
And we said something about,

703
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,840
it looks like you haven't been moving a whole lot of these.

704
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,840
And we touched the PlayStation 3 thing,

705
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,840
and he said, not really.

706
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,840
He said, the first couple days, there were a lot,

707
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,840
but not really.

708
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:43,840
So.

709
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:44,840
Yeah.

710
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:45,840
It's not looking good, Sony fans.

711
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,840
Sorry to say.

712
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,840
Maybe more when Metal Gear Solid and Final Fantasy 13 comes out.

713
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:51,840
We'll see.

714
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:52,840
But anyway.

715
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,840
Metal Gear Solid for Geriatric Snake.

716
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:55,840
We'll see.

717
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,840
Anyway.

718
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:59,840
Nobody likes a Geriatric Snake.

719
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:04,840
Or GZDr4ev says Unreal Tournament 3 will sell the PlayStation 3 units.

720
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:05,840
No it won't.

721
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:06,840
It will sell some.

722
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,840
There's fanboys for everything.

723
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,840
Well.

724
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:13,840
You know, maybe when they put out Jumping Flash 3.

725
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,840
But anyway.

726
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:20,840
For the 2.0 PS3 firmware update,

727
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:23,840
there is,

728
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:29,840
it was actually included that there were custom soundtracks for High Velocity Bowling.

729
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:33,840
Okay, who's playing High Velocity Bowling?

730
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,840
Well, I don't know whoever downloaded it this week.

731
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:36,840
Who knows?

732
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:40,840
But it also has an in-game friends list for the demo for Timeshift.

733
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:46,840
So it looks like that more games, hopefully, are going to be incorporating that type of thing.

734
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:49,840
Like, who's online, that type of thing.

735
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,840
So, unfortunately though, it's not going to be centralized.

736
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,840
It'll be up to the game people to put it in their games.

737
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:55,840
Yeah.

738
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,840
I mean,

739
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,840
they're not getting it.

740
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,840
I don't think they,

741
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,840
Microsoft's already figured it out.

742
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:10,840
Well, I think this is one of those things where maybe the PlayStation 3 should have waited a year before launching.

743
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:14,840
Because it sounds like this is one of those things that they just didn't implement in the system and now it's too late.

744
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,840
Although, I would think they could do a firmware upgrade.

745
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,840
I mean, they do those pretty frequently.

746
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:21,840
This was from the last firmware upgrade.

747
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:22,840
Huh.

748
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,840
But, it's just,

749
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,840
it seems like more of a case to be like,

750
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,840
Oh crap, we should have done that here.

751
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:31,840
Oh well, it's a free service, so whatever.

752
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,840
Don't implement it when they feel like it.

753
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:36,840
I guess that's true, at least they don't charge.

754
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:39,840
And if you want to play games on Xbox Live, you've got to pay.

755
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,840
Don't charge and it shows.

756
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,840
Well, anyway.

757
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,840
Anyways,

758
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:49,840
however, retailers are charging for games and here's what's coming out this week.

759
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:53,840
Not a whole lot and it's a lot of leftovers, actually.

760
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:58,840
Anyways, Blacksite Area 51 is finally making its way out on the PlayStation 3.

761
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:01,840
Way to be on top of things, Midway.

762
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:05,840
Go Unreal Tournament 3 Engine, or Unreal Engine 3, whatever.

763
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,840
Speaking of Unreal,

764
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,840
Unreal Tournament 3 is coming out this week on PS3 as well.

765
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:16,840
Universe at War, Earth Assault on the PC.

766
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:20,840

00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,840
Let's see here.

00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:29,840

769
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:32,840
Luxor 2 on the DS.

770
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,840
Hooray.

771
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,840
Let's see here.

772
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,840
Super Swing Golf Season 2.

773
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:42,840
That's going to be coming out, in case you like the last one.

774
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,840
I don't know how many people are getting this.

775
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,840
Madden NFL 08 Español.

776
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,840
The Spanish version.

777
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:51,840
Hey, you know what?

778
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:55,840
It makes the game appealing to an audience that maybe wasn't able to get into it before, you know?

779
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:58,840
Exactly. Now with more luchadors.

780
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,840
Unfortunately, that's not true.

781
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,840
The luchadors are great.

782
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:05,840
Is that it?

783
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,840
Let's see.

784
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,840
No, that's not it.

785
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,840
The Golden Compass on PC.

786
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:16,840
Oh, goodie! I'm so glad we have that.

787
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:19,840
Showtime Boxing on the Wii.

788
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,840
And...

789
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,840
And that's it.

790
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:30,840
And we move on to Japanese release dates, starting off on the Xbox 360.

791
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:35,840
Kingdom Under Fire, Circle of Doom comes out this week in Japan.

792
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:45,840
Also Smash Court Tennis 3, Stuntman Ignition, and the Castle of Shikigami 3 comes out as well on the Xbox 360.

793
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:51,840
Moving on to the PlayStation 3, Gran Turismo 5 Prologue makes its way to the PlayStation 3.

794
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:55,840
And, of course, there's a new racing wheel coming out in Japan to go with that.

795
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:58,840
Timed just in time on the Nintendo Wii.

796
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:05,840
Chocobo's Dungeon, Tokiwasure no Meikyu is coming out from Squeenix is coming out on the Nintendo Wii.

797
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:17,840

798
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,840
Shanghai comes out.

799
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:23,840
I don't know if that's a redone version of the old Mahjong game, but I don't know.

800
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,840
That comes out on the Nintendo Wii. I somehow doubt that.

801
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:28,840
Soul Calibur Legends also makes its way to the Nintendo Wii.

802
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:31,840
Another version of the Castle of Shikigami 3.

803
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:35,840
And, We Love Golf also comes out on the Nintendo Wii.

804
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,840
That's coming over here in February, I believe.

805
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,840
Is it?

806
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,840
It's a Capcom one.

807
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,840
All right.

808
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:43,840
Also coming out on other systems, we have the PlayStation 2 gets.

809
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:49,840
Hakurina Heart comes out as well as Spectral Gene, and that's all the PS2 gets this week.

810
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:57,840
And coming out on the Nintendo DS, Fuji no Mori no Let's Tarot is coming out.

811
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:58,840
What?

812
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:02,840
I wonder if that's a tarot card game. I don't know.

813
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:09,840
And Kuru Kuru Princess Yumi no White Quartet comes out as well this week on the DS.

814
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:14,840
And lastly but not leastly, we have the PSP gets.

815
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,840
Innocent Life comes out.

816
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:19,840
Oh, actually, that's just a price reduction.

817
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,840
Comes out.

818
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:26,840
And also, just for you guys in chat, Dustcat Portable 2 makes its way out this week.

819
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,840
You know what I need to do, Rob?

820
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,840
What?

821
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,840
I need to put up that picture I took of you at Best Buy.

822
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,840
Oh, with Imagine Babies?

823
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,840
Yeah, we found Imagine Babies.

824
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:35,840
Very interesting game.

825
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:40,840
Yes, Fuji no Mori no Let's Tarot does look to be a tarot card game for the DS.

826
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:41,840
That sounds like fun.

827
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,840
Yumi wants.

828
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:47,840
And Shanghai is indeed a version of the old Mahjong classic on the Nintendo Wii.

829
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,840
It is indeed that.

830
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,840
There you have it, your Japanese release dates.

831
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:56,840
Well, for our friends in the UK, not a whole bunch is coming out.

832
00:38:56,840 --> 00:39:04,840
On the 14th is Beowulf, Half-Life 2 Episode 2, Portal, Team Fortress 2, The Orange...

833
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,840
Wait, did I already do these?

834
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:09,840
You know it says December.

835
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:12,840
I'm like, okay, it's being all bizarre.

836
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:17,840
Yeah, Beowulf, Half-Life 2 Episode 2, Portal, Team Fortress 2, and then The Orange Box.

837
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,840
They are releasing them separately.

838
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:22,840
Time Shift and Wipeout Pulse.

839
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:29,840
And of course all of the Half-Life related things were on PlayStation 3.

840
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:32,840
Alright, kind of a slow week over in the UK.

841
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:33,840
Yep.

842
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,840
Oh well.

843
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:37,840
Maybe it'll get a little more busy before the end of the year.

844
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:40,840
Or at least early next year when they start getting all the stuff that we got this year.

845
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,840
Poor guys over there.

846
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:49,840
I will be more than happy to send gifts overseas if people send me any booze.

847
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:50,840
Money!

848
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:51,840
Alright.

849
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:55,840
Let's get back into the gaming news.

850
00:39:55,840 --> 00:40:01,840
Anyways, it's another week so that means there must be another Korean MMO coming.

851
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:05,840
And this time it's going to be a game called Perfect K.O.

852
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:10,840
It's actually a fighting game MMO and it's got an unlikely duo of characters that are

853
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,840
going to be making their way to it.

854
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:17,840
And those two characters, of course, would be Ken and Chung Lee from the Street Fighter

855
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:18,840
series.

856
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:19,840
It actually looks kind of neat.

857
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:23,840
It's sort of like a 3D brawl game or something like that.

858
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:28,840
And then of course as you beat up more people you can customize your avatar and that kind

859
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,840
of fun stuff.

860
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:34,840
But that's kind of neat to see that they're actually licensing characters from Capcom.

861
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:39,840
Hopefully they'll license characters from some other things.

862
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:40,840
That's going to be interesting.

863
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,840
What other kind of characters are in this game besides Ken and Chung Lee?

864
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:43,840
They didn't really mention.

865
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:47,840
It's a lot of stuff that they've designed themselves but the character designs are really

866
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:48,840
cool.

867
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:55,840
It'd be nice to see some of these characters from this Korean game move over to say Street

868
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,840
Fighter IV or something like that.

869
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:00,840
Speaking of Street Fighter IV, there were a lot of new details released this week.

870
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:01,840
First off, I've got to ask though.

871
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:06,840
Did you hear about the drama going on behind the Street Fighter IV news?

872
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:12,840
This Brazilian news site put out these screenshots from Street Fighter IV, these new screenshots

873
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,840
besides the one we'd seen previously.

874
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:18,840
They put out some new screenshots and one up sick the lawyers on them.

875
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,840
Or as if Davis were to say, sick the lawyers on them.

876
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:26,840
And people were like, rah, rah, rah, the corporation's taken down the independent voice and certainly

877
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,840
I was kind of going a little bit of that too.

878
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,840
I'm like, boy those bastards, da da da.

879
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:35,840
But at the same time it turns out, who knew that actually the leak came from the fact

880
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:39,840
that the person that runs that website is some type of contractor for EGM in Brazil.

881
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:44,840
So he actually did steal internal information, I guess ended up admitting to it.

882
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,840
So I don't know why he did that.

883
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:47,840
Wasn't smart.

884
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:50,840
Maybe he thought it was already out in America or something.

885
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,840
No, he just wanted to leak it.

886
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:55,840
No one wins here except for us.

887
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:56,840
That's right.

888
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,840
The users win because we got all that information.

889
00:41:58,840 --> 00:41:59,840
We got three screenshots.

890
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:00,840
That's right, new screenshot.

891
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:03,840
But honestly, they didn't give you that much more.

892
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,840
It was all on the same stage still.

893
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:08,840
I think one was a fireball shot, which was kind of cool, but that was really it.

894
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:11,840
But some other information did come out.

895
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:15,840
And EGM is not happy about it because this is how they were going to sell their magazines this week.

896
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:18,840
The game will actually run at 60 frames per second.

897
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:23,840
The storyline takes place between Super Street Fighter II Turbo and Street Fighter III.

898
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:26,840
Lots of old school characters will return.

899
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:31,840
There's going to be two new female characters, but no characters from Street Fighter III.

900
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:35,840
So you kind of wonder if Capcom isn't just kind of writing off Street Fighter III in a way.

901
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:41,840
They should have brought that guy's name Oro back, but he can have both of his arms this time.

902
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:44,840
And then in Street Fighter IV, he loses the arms.

903
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:45,840
You know, continuity.

904
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,840
You never know.

905
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,840
Actually, I don't think that he lost his arm.

906
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:52,840
I think it's tied behind his back.

907
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:53,840
Whatever.

908
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:54,840
He had one arm.

909
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:55,840
That's all that matters to me.

910
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,840
I don't care if he's tied behind his back.

911
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:00,840
Whatever he wants to do with his severed limb is fine with me.

912
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:07,840
As most people speculated, the screenshots that you do see in the pictures floating around the Internet right now is Chun-Li's new stage.

913
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:10,840
The parry system that was in Street Fighter III, gone.

914
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:14,840
New system in place, it's called Saving Revenge, something like that.

915
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:16,840
Some new system is in place.

916
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:21,840
It's built around cancels, and there will be its own gauge that's separate from the super meter.

917
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:22,840
There are supers in the game.

918
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:25,840
Don't know if it's Street Fighter III's or Super Street Fighter II Turbos.

919
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,840
There's also ultras.

920
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:29,840
My God, there's lots of different types of moves.

921
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,840
Here's the other weird thing.

922
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:34,840
Shang-Long may actually be in the game.

923
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:38,840
But there's kind of a May, and we don't know if that's just a running gag from EGM,

924
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:42,840
because that was one of their first April Fools jokes years ago.

925
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:45,840
Back when I used to get that magazine delivered to my house, like 15 years ago.

926
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:47,840
Back when it was good.

927
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:50,840
Back in the day, certainly.

928
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:54,840
And rumor is, we will see Street Fighter IV in the arcades with online play,

929
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:58,840
also in the PlayStation 3 and 360, all of them online.

930
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:02,840
Wouldn't it be cool if the console versions interfaced with the arcade somehow?

931
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:05,840
Of course, then you kind of wonder why would anybody go to the arcade,

932
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:08,840
but community, and maybe there will be something special the arcade version has there.

933
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:10,840
If it did, it'd probably be only with the PlayStation 3 version,

934
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:14,840
since you've got Live, and Live isn't cross-platform, very easy.

935
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:17,840
Well, they've got Final Fantasy XI to work somehow, so it's possible.

936
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:20,840
Yeah, but see, Final Fantasy XI runs off the Square Enix servers,

937
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:23,840
because you're connecting to Play Online.

938
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:24,840
That's totally separate.

939
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:27,840
That's why you have to pay that stupid monthly fee.

940
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:31,840
So anyways, obviously take some of that stuff with a grain of salt,

941
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:35,840
in regards to Shang-Long and the online arcade stuff.

942
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:36,840
Take all that with a grain of salt.

943
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:39,840
But it does sound, as far as the rest of it, that it's pretty cemented.

944
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:43,840
I mean, the 60 frames a second and stuff, it sounds like it's going to be a winner.

945
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:46,840
So I have to say, I'm already a little more excited about Street Fighter IV

946
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:48,840
than I ever was about Street Fighter III.

947
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:49,840
It looks pretty good.

948
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:51,840
I like the art style in it.

949
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:55,840
I was kind of crossing my fingers that it'd be more like the trailer,

950
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:56,840
because that was really cool.

951
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:58,840
But the art style's okay.

952
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:02,840
I like what they're doing where it's 3D, but it's 2D type thing.

953
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:05,840
Some of the facial animations, though, that they had,

954
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:09,840
like some of the screenshots, a little weird.

955
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:13,840
It looks a little wonky, but I think it'll be fine.

956
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:15,840
Jamie, I know you've been a Street Fighter fan for ages and ages.

957
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:18,840
Are you happy about Street Fighter IV?

958
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:21,840
I'm reserving judgment until I actually play it.

959
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:23,840
Okay, so you're not letting the hype get to you at all?

960
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:24,840
Nope.

961
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:25,840
All right, fair enough.

962
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:28,840
I still think that it's only going to take a week before

963
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:32,840
a bunch of fighting game fans completely break the system.

964
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:34,840
If it is online?

965
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:36,840
Oh, not just online.

966
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:38,840
I mean, just the game itself.

967
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:39,840
That's all dedicated there.

968
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:41,840
They'll break any fighting game system.

969
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:43,840
Figure out how to cheat real quick?

970
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:44,840
We'll see.

971
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:45,840
We will see.

972
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:48,840
Anyway, let's move on to some more news.

973
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:54,840
Well, for the Xbox originals, they are, well, region locked.

974
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:57,840
You can't get past it.

975
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:01,840
Where the Japanese demos are working, the games themselves are not.

976
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:03,840
There's no such thing as can't.

977
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:05,840
That's what I say.

978
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:09,840
Just not now is what Loki is hoping for this.

979
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:11,840
But they got some extra games in Japan.

980
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:13,840
Well, not necessarily extra, but they got different games in Japan

981
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:14,840
than we got here, huh?

982
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:16,840
Here's the problem.

983
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:17,840
Go ahead. Sorry.

984
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:21,840
Well, they actually tested, for example, with Magatama.

985
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:25,840
They said that they got a message that said the download was not

986
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:28,840
available in your region.

987
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:31,840
Well, I think it's because it's either looking at one or two things.

988
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:34,840
It's either looking at the region of your console, which case,

989
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:36,840
yeah, you're kind of screwed then.

990
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:39,840
Or it's looking at the region of your IP.

991
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:42,840
If that's the case, you could probably just route your IP through

992
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:47,840
like a mirror, say somewhere overseas, and it might work.

993
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:49,840
But I'm guessing it's looking at the region of your console

994
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:51,840
because that would make more sense.

995
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:52,840
But it's weird, though.

996
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:55,840
It just won't let you download it whatsoever.

997
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:56,840
Who cares?

998
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:57,840
It's a fucking Xbox game.

999
00:46:57,840 --> 00:46:58,840
Seriously.

1000
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:00,840
I mean, if you...

1001
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:02,840
I don't know.

1002
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:03,840
It's an Xbox game.

1003
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:04,840
Do you really need to download it?

1004
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:05,840
It's old.

1005
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:07,840
Play something new.

1006
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:08,840
I don't know.

1007
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:12,840
I'm noticing that because of the old Xbox games coming back,

1008
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:15,840
I've had a lot of friends tell me the Indigo Prophecy,

1009
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:18,840
kind of a game that may have been, I don't want to say overlooked

1010
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:21,840
because it certainly had its fans, but overlooked by many

1011
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:24,840
is kind of getting a little bit of a resurgence with this.

1012
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:26,840
And I've had people actually send me messages on Xbox Live

1013
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:28,840
going, dude, you need to check out Indigo Prophecy

1014
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:29,840
if you haven't already played it before.

1015
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:31,840
It's kind of fun.

1016
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:33,840
Go buy it in the stores, people.

1017
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:35,840
It's probably cheaper than buying it online.

1018
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:36,840
Seriously.

1019
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:39,840
And then you get the disk and maybe a manual.

1020
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:42,840
I mean, instead of having to read a PDF file online,

1021
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:44,840
just go look.

1022
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:48,840
This stuff is so old, it's probably dirt cheap by now.

1023
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:50,840
I guess there's one way to find out.

1024
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:51,840
You've got to go out there and shop.

1025
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:53,840
Oh, you want to hear something funny?

1026
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:54,840
What is it?

1027
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:55,840
Ha ha ha.

1028
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:56,840
Shut up.

1029
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:59,840
Anyways, Katamari Damacy.

1030
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:04,840
That game, when it came out, that was like a $20 game, wasn't it?

1031
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:05,840
The original one on PlayStation 2?

1032
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:06,840
Yeah.

1033
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:07,840
That was a budget game, $19.99.

1034
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:08,840
$20 game.

1035
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:11,840
It's only used at GameStop for 30 bucks.

1036
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:15,840
I'm like, 10 bucks over retail, and it's used.

1037
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:16,840
Right.

1038
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:18,840
But that's because they don't make it retail anymore, right?

1039
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:19,840
It doesn't matter, though.

1040
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:21,840
It should still be cheap.

1041
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:24,840
Well, what about, okay, what about, like, frickin' old-ass PlayStation 1 games?

1042
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:27,840
Like, for the longest time, Intelligent Cube, they were charging an arm and a leg for.

1043
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:30,840
Symphony of the Night, before it was out on Xbox Live, they were charging...

1044
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:34,840
I didn't think Katamari, the first one, had a really high demand for it.

1045
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:37,840
And, like, Street Fighter, was it Marvel vs. Street Fighter 2?

1046
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:40,840
That's going for, you know, quite a bit.

1047
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:44,840
Or Marvel vs. Capcom 2.

1048
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:49,840
But, um, I didn't think Katamari was, like, you know, going to bring in a demand of $10

1049
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:50,840
over retail.

1050
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:51,840
Especially used.

1051
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:57,840
Well, uh, let's go ahead and move on with the news.

1052
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:02,840
Anyways, there's yet another stupid lawsuit that goes with Halo 3.

1053
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:05,840
It's like, Halo 3, more stupid lawsuits.

1054
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:10,840
This time, some dumb shit is complaining that there's not a lot of, um, there's some pixels

1055
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:11,840
missing, apparently.

1056
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:18,840
Because, apparently, uh, Halo 3, you know, has upscaled 640p, I guess, is missing 80

1057
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:21,840
pixels, and they explain why they did that and stuff.

1058
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:26,840
So now they're suing because it's not truly 720p.

1059
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:29,840
And they're saying it's false advertising.

1060
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:30,840
What?

1061
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:31,840
For real?

1062
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:33,840
This verse is for real?

1063
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:38,840
That's sad, and, you know what, I heard about this, and I actually looked at the back of

1064
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:45,840
the box, and on the back it just says, HDTV, you know, 720p, 1080i, 1080p.

1065
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:49,840
It doesn't explicitly say, this game runs natively in these formats.

1066
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:50,840
But what game does?

1067
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:51,840
None of them do.

1068
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:52,840
No, none of them.

1069
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:55,840
And here's the thing, is I would say, okay, why don't you count the pixels that are on

1070
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:56,840
your TV there?

1071
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:57,840
720 of them?

1072
00:49:57,840 --> 00:49:58,840
Okay.

1073
00:49:58,840 --> 00:49:59,840
Shut up.

1074
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:05,340
So they're trying to say it's false advertising because the game wasn't programmed in 720

1075
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:06,340
or whatever.

1076
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:07,340
Whatever, dude.

1077
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:10,340
That is seriously a stupid complaint.

1078
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:12,040
That's gonna get thrown out.

1079
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:14,040
I hope so.

1080
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:19,960
Well, all I know is that all these freaking Halo 3 lawsuits, god damn they make us mad,

1081
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:37,120
and when we get mad, people die.

1082
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:42,240
It is time for my annual Christmas FU.

1083
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:47,760
It's a combination of everything about the holiday season that pisses me off.

1084
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:53,320
So, and again, it's all pretty ridiculous, you know, I'm not attacking anybody, but first

1085
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:57,320
of all, the people who over-decorate their houses that look like Christmas puked all

1086
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:01,760
over their house, oh my god, learn what aesthetics are for.

1087
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:04,520
Seriously, what about that tree?

1088
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:05,520
This outside...

1089
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,760
Did I not tell you that tree was hideous?

1090
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:09,680
It's okay.

1091
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:13,400
And Rob put it best when he told me about it at first, that the whole top part of the

1092
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:17,440
tree is not lit because probably a light bulb burnt out.

1093
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:22,520
There's this ginormous tree in front of a church, and it's like it's not wearing a top,

1094
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:24,520
because a bulb burned out at the top of the tree.

1095
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:25,520
This is what I think, though.

1096
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:26,520
I don't think that's it.

1097
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:30,160
I think they didn't, they just actually didn't decorate it, because there's different types

1098
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:31,160
of lights.

1099
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:35,420
There's a loop of white lights going around it, and then there's multicolored lights,

1100
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:41,440
and then, and then that one, that place that had the Christmas crap everywhere.

1101
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:45,200
I was like, oh my god, now I understand being into the season, and I understand having a

1102
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,720
few lights, and you know, and that's cool.

1103
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:51,280
I love to see things that are tastefully decorated.

1104
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:54,560
Like, we have some tacky Christmas lights here in the studio.

1105
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:55,560
That's cute.

1106
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:59,160
You know, I can, like, the icicle lights are nice.

1107
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:03,960
Maybe having a Santa in your front yard or decorating a tree in your front yard, but

1108
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:09,640
like, this is the worst example ever, and it's one house that was in Mobile, Alabama,

1109
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:15,080
that I saw right before, probably the year I moved out, and that was these people who

1110
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:19,900
strung Christmas lights all over their yard, across their yard, in patches.

1111
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:25,100
Their house freaking glowed, and I was like, and on top of it, they were all multicolored,

1112
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:28,080
so it looked like that cut light just, like, throw up.

1113
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:31,760
I'm not joking, and that originated the phrase Christmas threw up on that house.

1114
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:36,160
I saw a very offensive house last night, and it was one of those houses where they had

1115
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:42,080
the radio station playing, and you tune your car to a certain frequency on the radio, and

1116
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:46,760
then you can, like, the lights flash in sync with the music, right?

1117
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:50,480
Okay, but it's hideous, because if you don't have the radio station turned on, it just

1118
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:55,680
looks like this house is randomly flashing all of their lights, like, and I swear to

1119
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:56,680
God, I almost had a seizure driving.

1120
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:58,480
The house is having a seizure.

1121
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:00,840
I almost had a fucking seizure driving by that house.

1122
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:01,840
It's not funny.

1123
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:04,960
Like, seriously, somebody is going to crash into that house, and all the kids in that

1124
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:09,440
house are going to be in a fire, because that house is going to cause somebody to have a

1125
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:10,440
seizure.

1126
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:15,080
And on top of that, imagine these people's freaking power bill, you know, but anyway,

1127
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:20,400
and the other part, another part of my, um, my, uh, F.U. goes towards, um, people who

1128
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:24,200
are thinking that Christmas is the actually only the celebration that happens around this

1129
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:29,200
year, when there's a bunch of different religions that celebrate around the same, you know,

1130
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:35,120
time every year, and that really Christmas should actually be in, like, spring, if you're,

1131
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:39,320
if you're going by, quote, biblical standards, because the census would have happened in

1132
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:42,200
the spring, and you guys stole a pagan holiday.

1133
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:45,400
Thank you, Catholic Church, but, you know.

1134
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:47,160
You can address those cards and letters to Jamie at Orange.

1135
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:48,160
I'll show you that.

1136
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:51,440
What about the people that have the big inflatable snow globes in their front lawn?

1137
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:53,040
You gotta love that shit, huh?

1138
00:53:53,040 --> 00:54:01,440
Okay, I don't mind one, but I drove by a house that had three, and a giant inflatable Santa,

1139
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:05,720
whose legs were broken, so he was laying on his nose.

1140
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:06,720
This is in my neighborhood.

1141
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:09,020
That's a prime target for a BB gun drive.

1142
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:10,400
Someone broke Santa's legs?

1143
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:11,400
That's not very nice.

1144
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:12,400
Someone broke Santa's legs.

1145
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:14,960
Santa gives a mobster his present this year.

1146
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:21,880
But, but no, I, there's just, you know, I, I really, it's the whole over-commercialism

1147
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:26,280
of everything, and the, the fact that people get so close-minded, okay, here's part three

1148
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:27,680
of my Christmas F.U.

1149
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:28,680
Oh, Christ.

1150
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:29,680
Drivers!

1151
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:35,720
Because I can't do an F.U. without bringing up how stupidly mean people get during the

1152
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:36,720
holidays!

1153
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:43,760
Okay, I, I went to buy something at the store, and this person's pushing past me, buying

1154
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:47,480
their Christmas tree, and I'm like, I was in line for-

1155
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:48,480
AHHH!

1156
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:49,480
I'm like, shit!

1157
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:54,280
And then, and then everybody drives, like, a freakin' retard on the road, because they

1158
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:57,120
have to get to the mall, ooh.

1159
00:54:57,120 --> 00:55:03,400
And it's just like, okay, what happened to the whole, you know, being nice to everybody

1160
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:08,200
during the holidays, and trying to, to share the spirit and everything, because people

1161
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:12,600
don't give a shit about the Christmas spirit, they care about their own personal agenda.

1162
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:17,000
You know, maybe there should be more ball shootings, if that were the case.

1163
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Whoa!

1164
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Whoa!

1165
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,600
I wouldn't go there, wow, too soon, too soon.

1166
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:27,520
No, no, no, no, but, but this is the whole thing, is that, you know, people are, you

1167
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:33,760
know, and I'm getting this from the same people, where they're all like, oh, well, you know,

1168
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:39,120
holiday this, you know, have to be nice, baby Jesus, whatever, and then these same people

1169
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:44,640
are being complete and utter assholes, and I'm, I'm not even, you know, making this up,

1170
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:51,120
I'm seeing people that I know do this, and I'm like, God, what a freakin' hypocrite, you

1171
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:52,120
know?

1172
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:55,720
Just, don't open your mouth around me ever again.

1173
00:55:55,720 --> 00:56:00,160
Alright, quick chatroom comments, this is J100Matt, says, apparently the higher your

1174
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:02,760
energy bill, the more Jesus and God love you.

1175
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:03,760
That's brilliant.

1176
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:06,920
Alright, let's move on with the FUs.

1177
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:14,240
Anyways, FU2, the kids across the street from my apartment complex were having car wash

1178
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:15,240
today.

1179
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:20,960
They started at about nine this morning, yelling, oh, by the way, there was also one of those

1180
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:24,320
cars, you know, the ones that have the sound systems that are way too loud with way too

1181
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:31,800
much bass, that was playing from nine in the morning to about five in the afternoon, and

1182
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:39,040
these kids yelling, car wash, car wash, car wash, for like seven fucking hours, I mean,

1183
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:42,640
it's just so annoying all day long.

1184
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:47,280
Oh, and then also, FU2, my neighbors who apparently thought it was fun to have a party at four

1185
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:52,960
in the morning with their drunken friends who were riding a bike that some kid left

1186
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:56,840
outside and you're honking the horn on the bike, so no.

1187
00:56:56,840 --> 00:57:00,720
Wow, you live in a classy part of town, that sucks.

1188
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:01,720
That's it.

1189
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:05,560
Uh, puppy, why don't you go ahead.

1190
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:13,200
Big FU to ITT Technical Institute and your terrible scheduling policies, because I tried,

1191
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:17,280
I started my program for drafting last year.

1192
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:22,280
I should have been done by now, but I'm not going to graduate until six months from now

1193
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:27,360
because when I change my schedule once, it can really fuck me up for the rest of the

1194
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:28,360
year.

1195
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:31,720
It's like, oh yeah, we'll get a teacher to teach that one class for you since you didn't

1196
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:35,840
get to finish it in that quarter, and they didn't offer it for three more quarters, so

1197
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:40,360
now I'm really behind, and it's going to cost me more money, and I'm pissed, and now I have

1198
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:42,440
to take four classes this quarter.

1199
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:50,600
Um, well, I don't think I really have any FUs myself, um, I'm actually kind of having

1200
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:56,200
a good week, so I guess FU to the fact that it's been so cold lately, I'll give a FU that,

1201
00:57:56,200 --> 00:58:01,000
my house has been very cold lately, and, um, you know, since we live in California, we're

1202
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:04,560
very spoiled when it comes to cold, and just the slightest bit of cold air, it's like,

1203
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:12,520
oh my god, get a jacket, FU to magazine solicitors too, I had three of them on my door this week.

1204
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:16,680
Somebody came to my door last night, and I told him that I had the flu, and that I was

1205
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:21,040
highly contagious, and he really should leave.

1206
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:23,560
I'm not making that up either, he's great.

1207
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:26,120
He just looked at me like, okay, bye.

1208
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:27,120
Wow.

1209
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:28,120
I should have thought of that.

1210
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:31,280
Around in this neighborhood, they just have the kids do all this listing, because it's

1211
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:34,120
kind of hard to tell a kid that, you know, you're going to give them bubonic plague if

1212
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:35,680
they don't get off your doorstep.

1213
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:40,560
Or you just, you know, open your door wearing nothing but a towel.

1214
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:46,600
I still, though, have my favorite story about my friend with the Jehovah's Witnesses, while

1215
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:52,600
she was listening to Tubular Bells, making a red velvet cake, so she came out with this

1216
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:59,760
knife with, like, red fluid on it, and said, WHAT?

1217
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:04,960
This is my friend that used to work for Lockheed.

1218
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:06,720
Alright, let's move on.

1219
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:09,320
We gotta get back to gaming news, weirdos.

1220
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:13,680
Alright, oh, and what a heck of a story to get back into.

1221
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:17,960
Yes, our buddy Jeff Girtzman, which took up about an hour of last week's show.

1222
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:21,240
We have some quick updates, and I don't want to spend too much time talking in this, because

1223
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:25,000
I'll be goddamn if this story just didn't blow up way more than it should have.

1224
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,560
You gotta fire it, get over it.

1225
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:27,560
Yeah, exactly.

1226
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:28,560
Anyhow.

1227
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:29,560
Was it that crap you were talking about?

1228
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:34,880
Yeah, I was trying to catch Jamie up on what happened when she was out, so anyhow, here's

1229
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:35,880
your updates.

1230
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:37,800
I should have some music that plays during this.

1231
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:38,800
Hold on, I need music.

1232
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:42,000
Jamie, why don't you give us your thoughts on the issue while we get some happy music

1233
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,800
to play during the Girtzman update.

1234
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:44,800
Happy music?

1235
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:45,800
Should we play some Lincoln Park?

1236
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:46,800
There's too much fun in this.

1237
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:53,680
Oh, it's too bad that I don't have the song from End of Evangelion, the happy suicide

1238
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:54,680
song.

1239
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:55,680
Alright, hold on.

1240
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:57,680
We'll play some happy music here while we give you the Jeff Girtzman update.

1241
00:59:57,680 --> 00:59:58,680
I agree too, and stars.

1242
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:01,680
Oh yeah, I got it.

1243
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:04,360
Alright.

1244
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:10,760
This week in Girtzmanville, Girtzman made a comment to Joystick.com.

1245
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:16,560
Saying, quote, I stand behind my work, regardless of where I do it.

1246
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:21,760
If there was content that I felt I couldn't support, it wouldn't see the light of day.

1247
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:27,320
Then later on, this week, GameSpot posted a Q&A.

1248
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:31,760
Here's a clip from the Q&A, question, was Eidos Interactive upset by the game's review?

1249
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:36,700
Answer, it has been confirmed that Eidos representatives expressed their displeasure to their appropriate

1250
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:39,280
contacts at GameSpot, but not to editorial directly.

1251
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:43,040
It was not the first time a publisher has voiced disappointment with the game review,

1252
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:44,240
and it won't be the last.

1253
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:49,440
However, it is strict GameSpot policy never to let any such feelings result in a review

1254
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:52,280
score to be altered or a video review to be pulled.

1255
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:55,800
Also, I'd like to quote Mr. Horse from Eidos.

1256
01:00:55,800 --> 01:01:01,780
He said, no, sir, I do not like it.

1257
01:01:01,780 --> 01:01:06,560
In response to the GameSpot Q&A, the users of GameSpot said, thank you, you assholes,

1258
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:09,520
for posting that a whole four days late.

1259
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:15,100
Then later on this week, as if no more could go wrong with Kane and Lynch, the review site

1260
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:20,320
got criticized by, I'm sorry, the reviews got criticized by Kotaku.

1261
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:22,080
They were posting clips of reviews.

1262
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:27,800
One of the clips happened to be from Kotaku, and it had a five-star logo above the review,

1263
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:31,320
which makes you think, five-star review.

1264
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:35,140
But in fact, the five stars were just a graphic, and Kotaku was pissed off because they don't

1265
01:01:35,140 --> 01:01:37,520
review games in stars.

1266
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:41,120
They don't review games, period.

1267
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:43,600
So that's from a preview of the game.

1268
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:48,720
And that's your update on what's going on in Gertsmanville.

1269
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:49,720
And to be honest, I don't really care anymore.

1270
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:50,720
Now, stop caring.

1271
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:51,720
I'm stopped.

1272
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:52,720
Hey, Rob?

1273
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:53,720
Yes.

1274
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:54,720
I didn't care in the first place.

1275
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:55,920
I'm glad to hear it.

1276
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:57,640
That's because you're all better people than I.

1277
01:01:57,640 --> 01:02:01,840
That's because I wasn't here, thank God.

1278
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:02,840
All right.

1279
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:05,520
Let's move on, then, past Gershman Gate, if we could.

1280
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:12,080
Well, I have something that's a little happy, except that I think that it was already there.

1281
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:17,860
There's a press release come out from Gravity that they've opened a US studio under the

1282
01:02:17,860 --> 01:02:24,240
name of L5 Games, and they've hired Blizzard folks to help run it.

1283
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:30,160
But the thing is that, now, since it's in San Mateo, but I actually remember trying

1284
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:36,560
to report Gravity to the Better Business Bureau.

1285
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:38,320
The fuck?

1286
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:45,720
When I was still on IRO because of some sort of banning of an account that was falsely

1287
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:46,720
done.

1288
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:47,720
This was a long time ago.

1289
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:54,080
But I was trying to find the stuff for somebody to report them to the Better Business Bureau,

1290
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:58,800
and it turned out that every time I tried to pull up the address for them, it came up

1291
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:01,280
with a San Mateo address.

1292
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:05,880
But this was like six years ago that this address was there.

1293
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:09,200
So I'm like, didn't they already have a US branch?

1294
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:11,160
Well, apparently the company didn't know.

1295
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:12,980
That's why they put out the press release.

1296
01:03:12,980 --> 01:03:13,980
Maybe they just had a PO box there.

1297
01:03:13,980 --> 01:03:14,980
Oh, my God, we do?

1298
01:03:14,980 --> 01:03:16,440
We should let everyone know.

1299
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:19,520
They had a mailboxes, et cetera, box there in San Mateo.

1300
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:20,520
That's about it.

1301
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:23,320
What was the Better Business Bureau going to do to them anyways, write them a nasty

1302
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:24,320
letter?

1303
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:29,760
Well, you know, buy-write got shut down.

1304
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:32,560
True.

1305
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:39,040
And it was pretty much because of all the crappy feedback that came back.

1306
01:03:39,040 --> 01:03:41,120
That's why we have the Better Business Bureau.

1307
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:43,000
They just supply feedback.

1308
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Gravity's just coming over to the US.

1309
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:48,000
I got free food because I reported a restaurant to the Better Business Bureau.

1310
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:52,180
They're going to increase their presence in the US so that Gravity can single-handedly

1311
01:03:52,180 --> 01:03:54,720
take on Activision Blizzard.

1312
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:55,720
That's what it is, right?

1313
01:03:55,720 --> 01:03:56,720
Good luck.

1314
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:57,720
All right.

1315
01:03:57,720 --> 01:04:01,400
I'll stick with my private servers.

1316
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:02,400
Thank you.

1317
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:07,360
Anyways, let's see here.

1318
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:10,600
Sometimes you might compare Gravity to Sucking.

1319
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:15,920
There's service and stuff, so well, here's something else that sucks or that probably

1320
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:16,920
will suck.

1321
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:18,680
The Castlevania movie.

1322
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:24,560
And yeah, okay, let me put it this way, and this will save us a lot of time in the future.

1323
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:29,640
Every single movie that's probably being written right now is on hold because of the writer's

1324
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:30,640
strike.

1325
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:34,280
Because you have no writer, you can't have any story being written.

1326
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:42,320
So like that, the Castlevania movie is on hold because of the writer's strike.

1327
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:50,940
Not that it's on hold from Sucking, I guess, I don't know, it's like slowing down a retard

1328
01:04:50,940 --> 01:04:54,880
running towards a cliff or something like that, I mean, as soon as you let go of them,

1329
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:56,760
they're just going to topple over the end.

1330
01:04:56,760 --> 01:04:57,760
Wow!

1331
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:02,160
What in the hell is, like, is there something in the air that's causing everybody to make

1332
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:04,520
very, very unpolitically correct statements tonight?

1333
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:05,520
I mean, what the hell?

1334
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:07,440
We're going to get lots of letters this week.

1335
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:09,920
Where have you been for the last, you know, 300 and some episodes?

1336
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:13,280
I don't know, in a cave.

1337
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:14,280
Or 200 and some episodes.

1338
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:15,280
What episode are we on?

1339
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:16,280
250?

1340
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:17,280
259!

1341
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:19,280
I've been doing 100 more episodes, Sam!

1342
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:23,040
I've been working way too damn hard, not recording one of them, but you know what?

1343
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:26,040
I do it for practice.

1344
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:33,760
Okay, I was going to make some joke about somebody actually writes those video game

1345
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:38,900
movies, but anyway, I totally lost it amongst Loki's high sense of sarcasm.

1346
01:05:38,900 --> 01:05:42,560
So why don't we spoil the VGAs, which are going on right now on the TV.

1347
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:46,880
Yes, did you know we're competing against the VGAs tonight, our live stream?

1348
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:48,440
So here, why don't we ruin it for you?

1349
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:53,320
BioShock won Game of the Year, Harmonix got Studio of the Year, Best Shooter, Call of

1358
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:44,080
you've all been wanting to hear about, Most Addictive Video Game Fueled by Do, Halo 3.

1359
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:45,400
Sponsored by Do.

1360
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:47,900
Although I think that was just a joke, actually, yeah.

1361
01:06:47,900 --> 01:06:52,320
So there, we just did you a favor and saved you from sitting through three hours of garbage

1362
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:54,320
advertisements and musical performances.

1363
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:55,420
There you have it.

1364
01:06:55,420 --> 01:06:58,760
You can send us the thank you cards, you can send us Christmas cards.

1365
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:03,920
We'll play Devil's Advocate here and not to pull you away from listening to our wonderful

1366
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:07,880
show, but they are going to have a new trailer for Borderlands, which looks pretty awesome.

1367
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:09,400
It'll be on YouTube tomorrow.

1368
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:11,680
But it looks awesome!

1369
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:12,680
I want to see it now.

1370
01:07:12,680 --> 01:07:15,720
It'll look awesome tomorrow on YouTube.

1371
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:21,360
Well, going on a tangent with Spike TV, yesterday I was watching a marathon of one of their

1372
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:23,600
reality shows because I was bored.

1373
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:24,600
Cheaters?

1374
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:27,040
No, it was the Ultimate Fighter.

1375
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:31,280
It was leading up to their finale UFC thing last night.

1376
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:35,120
For eight straight hours, there was nothing but teasing about, oh, we're going to show

1377
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:39,840
the cinematic opening to World of Warcraft during the UFC event.

1378
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:43,280
And it was the original opening from, you know, three years, it's three years old.

1379
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:47,320
And they're going to show this on live TV at a UFC event.

1380
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:51,200
I couldn't, I couldn't think of a worse audience to target that at.

1381
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:53,560
Chad Compton for the new expansion.

1382
01:07:53,560 --> 01:07:58,280
No, it was the original cinematic opening to the World of Warcraft, it wasn't Burning

1383
01:07:58,280 --> 01:07:59,280
Crusade.

1384
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:04,340
Comment from Chad, Dark Tetsuya said, the Spike Video Game Awards have been sponsored

1385
01:08:04,340 --> 01:08:12,920
by Harmonix, 2K Games, EA Sports, it's in the game, and by Mountain Dew, do the Dew.

1386
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:20,800
So in stuff that people actually care about, how about Silent Hill News?

1387
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:22,000
Ah, yes.

1388
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,000
Yes please.

1389
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,480
Silent Hill 5 News?

1390
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:26,440
Well, more like Silent Hill Origins.

1391
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:27,440
Ah, okay.

1392
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:30,800
They're talking about it having a PlayStation 2 port.

1393
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:32,640
Oh, that'll be kind of fun.

1394
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:34,880
Yeah, that'll be pretty cool.

1395
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:43,800
They're saying that it would, it's actually of course being, I think published by Climax.

1396
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:49,120
And they would also be presenting a second release.

1397
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:54,160
Hmm, that'll be kind of nice because Silent Hill is one of those games I can't really

1398
01:08:54,160 --> 01:08:55,960
get into on a handheld platform.

1399
01:08:55,960 --> 01:08:59,360
It's kind of something I need on a very large TV with all the lights out so I can cry like

1400
01:08:59,360 --> 01:09:01,600
a little girl when the monsters come out to eat me.

1401
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:05,800
Yeah, but you see, all you have to do is just get one of those nice PSPs with the video

1402
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:07,480
out and then you can play it on your TV.

1403
01:09:07,480 --> 01:09:09,920
Ah, that's true, but I don't have that because I'm not cool.

1404
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:15,160
Well, the second thing that they're working on is actually an unannounced project.

1405
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:17,240
Dun, dun, dun.

1406
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:20,560
I hope they just announce it.

1407
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:21,560
Was that it?

1408
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:22,560
I don't think that was it.

1409
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:26,520
Because if you announce an unannounced project, isn't that announcing the project?

1410
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:27,920
How about an untitled project?

1411
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:28,920
There you go.

1412
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:33,440
Or I should say a secret project because it may have a title, we just don't know what

1413
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:34,440
it is.

1414
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:38,360
It's not secret anymore if you just talked about it.

1415
01:09:38,360 --> 01:09:41,080
Mac Man in our chat room says something interesting here.

1416
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:45,480
Mac Man says Silent Hill 5 equals awesome and win and shit in my pants.

1417
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:50,200
What kind of comment is that?

1418
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:53,320
Gerardo Mo says Silent Hill needs to go steal all the VGAs.

1419
01:09:53,320 --> 01:09:54,320
Yes, I agree.

1420
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:55,880
He said that Pyramid Head goes to Silent Hill.

1421
01:09:55,880 --> 01:09:59,600
Pyramid Head needs to come do an acceptance speech and then...

1422
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:01,120
He'll make it with his big knife.

1423
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:02,560
That's right.

1424
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:03,880
To the entire front row.

1425
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:08,920
And we'll have to wait until next year then, I guess.

1426
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:10,400
Wouldn't that be a dream?

1427
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:14,720
Anyways, people are up in arms because GameTap's removing games.

1428
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:16,320
No.

1429
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:20,640
Some games you will not be able to play on GameTap anymore include Arthur's First Grade,

1430
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:22,720
Bionic Bunny's Good Deeds Contest.

1431
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:27,480
Okay, now hold the fuck up because there are actually some good games on that list, Loki.

1432
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:31,760
Stop being such a dick.

1433
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:34,840
I think one of the Civilization games is on there.

1434
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:37,320
No.

1435
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:38,560
I know there's games on there.

1436
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:40,320
Impossible Mission was on there.

1437
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:41,960
Oh, Impossible Mission.

1438
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:43,360
Oh, my mistake.

1439
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:44,360
That game's cool.

1440
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:45,360
Just shut your mouth.

1441
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:48,480
Anyways, yes, such wonderful games as Chip's Challenge.

1442
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:52,360
Does anyone remember that from Windows 3.1?

1443
01:10:52,360 --> 01:10:53,360
Command & Conquer.

1444
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:54,360
Okay, that was a pretty good game.

1445
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:59,960
Command & Conquer Red Alert, Descent, 2, 3, and Free Space.

1446
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:02,120
Oh, all the Ultima games are going offline.

1447
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:03,120
Earthworm Jim.

1448
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:04,120
Ultima's awesome.

1449
01:11:04,120 --> 01:11:05,120
Earthworm Jim 2.

1450
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:08,120
Earthworm Jim 3D.

1451
01:11:08,120 --> 01:11:09,480
Free Space 2.

1452
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:11,160
Impossible Mission 2.

1453
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:12,160
Woo-hoo.

1454
01:11:12,160 --> 01:11:13,160
MDK.

1455
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:14,520
Pretty good.

1456
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:15,520
See Jerk.

1457
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:16,520
Whatever.

1458
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:19,200
You know, and then other games like Pajama Sam.

1459
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:21,720
Life is rough when you lose stuff.

1460
01:11:21,720 --> 01:11:22,720
Oh.

1461
01:11:22,720 --> 01:11:23,720
Okay.

1462
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:31,120
Or Pajama Sam, you are what you eat from your head to your feet.

1463
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:32,120
Pajama Sam.

1464
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:34,440
Games to play on any day.

1465
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:35,440
Alright.

1466
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:39,520
Obviously, though, it's kind of sad because some of those games, like even you admit MDK

1467
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:43,800
and some of that stuff is kind of cool, the service is losing, and a lot of people are

1468
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:45,720
like, oh noes, why is GameTap deleting games?

1469
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:48,680
But I think the answer is probably just as simple as time's up.

1470
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:50,560
You know, they probably have these signed agreements.

1471
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:52,780
Their licensing's up with that, you know.

1472
01:11:52,780 --> 01:11:54,120
This will also make someone sad.

1473
01:11:54,120 --> 01:11:55,680
American Deer Hunting 2000.

1474
01:11:55,680 --> 01:11:56,680
Okay.

1475
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:59,440
Aren't all the games that are being pulled, like most of them come from one or two different

1476
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:00,440
companies, right?

1477
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:03,600
Like EA is one of them, and there's, I think, another one.

1478
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:08,320
And I think this probably just kind of screams that, hmm, EA is probably going to do their

1479
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:12,120
own thing, or EA is going to be signing a deal with somebody else soon where they're

1480
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:13,120
getting more money.

1481
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:16,840
Like some of the sim games are leaving, like Sim Toons, I didn't even realize there was

1482
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:27,200
a Sim Toons, Sim Tower, Sim Safari, Sim Park, Sim City 2000, Sim City Classic, Tetris, C.

1483
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:28,840
There's some good stuff leaving.

1484
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:29,840
Whatever.

1485
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:33,640
Seriously, it's like Winter Games.

1486
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:34,640
Alright.

1487
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:36,400
Well, we'll see what happens.

1488
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:37,400
Who knows?

1489
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:40,520
Maybe they'll be starting their own competing service soon, or maybe it's somebody else.

1490
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:41,520
Damn it!

1491
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:42,520
What?

1492
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:44,720
Putt Putt's One Stop Fun Shop is gone!

1493
01:12:44,720 --> 01:12:48,760
What am I going to play now?

1494
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:52,960
Also I want to say, it kind of sucks for them because they just had this big brouhaha over

1495
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:57,600
hooray, we hit our 1,000th game, and now losing these 70 games is going to put them back under

1496
01:12:57,600 --> 01:12:58,600
1,000.

1497
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:02,080
So I think it would be funny if in January they say, we hit our 1,000th game again!

1498
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:03,360
They should.

1499
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:05,840
That would be hilarious.

1500
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:12,520
Anyhow, let's wrap up part A of our show here.

1501
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:16,800
We're going to be back in a little bit with part B, but not before we do the Classic Game

1502
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:22,120
of the Week, because we always like to close off part A of our show by paying respects

1503
01:13:22,120 --> 01:13:29,320
to our elders, and we do that by bringing up the Classic Game of the Week.

1504
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:35,280
Dark Soccer, did you hear the old shows and hear the games that Loki and myself picked?

1505
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:37,360
You heard mine, but did you hear what Loki picked?

1506
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:39,240
Loki did Zombies Ate My Neighbors last week.

1507
01:13:39,240 --> 01:13:41,240
That game is great.

1508
01:13:41,240 --> 01:13:43,240
I was almost going to pick that one.

1509
01:13:43,240 --> 01:13:44,240
Almost!

1510
01:13:44,240 --> 01:13:45,240
I was looking at it.

1511
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:46,240
Well now he beat you to it.

1512
01:13:46,240 --> 01:13:47,240
So what are you going to do?

1513
01:13:47,240 --> 01:13:48,240
I have another game.

1514
01:13:48,240 --> 01:13:49,240
Alright, well alright.

1515
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:50,240
Me and five other people played.

1516
01:13:50,240 --> 01:13:54,240
Alright, then let's get into Dark Soccer's Game of the Week.

1517
01:13:54,240 --> 01:14:02,320
The game of the week is Threads of Faith, which was a Playstation RPG, but it was more

1518
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:06,000
like an adventure-basher-type game in Japan.

1519
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:11,840
It was called Do Prism, and you did one of two stories where you either played this sort

1520
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:20,700
of spoiled brat princess who has magic ability, or you played this guy who was a construct

1521
01:14:20,700 --> 01:14:27,160
and his, you know, big fat axe, and it's really, it actually had pretty good graphics for being

1522
01:14:27,160 --> 01:14:28,160
an old Playstation game.

1523
01:14:28,160 --> 01:14:33,720
It was really simple for how it played, but it was really fun.

1524
01:14:33,720 --> 01:14:37,400
And I actually tried to play, I actually started playing through Do Prism, and then when Threads

1525
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:42,800
of Faith came out, I had to just go out and get it, so, and I actually found my copy of

1526
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:45,120
it the other day, which made me think about it.

1527
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:49,280
It was just a really cool little game, and it had its own pretty good following overseas

1528
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:57,280
too, to the point where there was a fan version of a sequel called Duo Princess, where you

1529
01:14:57,280 --> 01:15:06,000
play as the Princess Mint and her sister Maya, so it was pretty good.

1530
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:15,120
I really just love this game, but, you know, it came out the same time that Vagrant Story,

1531
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:22,240
Legend of Mana, Chrono Cross, and Parasite II came out, so it sort of fell to the sidelines,

1532
01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:25,080
I guess, but I liked it.

1533
01:15:25,080 --> 01:15:26,080
I thought it was a great game.

1534
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:28,240
So you're bringing it back for another round by reminding people of it.

1535
01:15:28,240 --> 01:15:32,480
I wanted that more than Chrono Cross, I'll put it that way.

1536
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:38,960
Yeah, Chrono Cross wasn't that great for me, yeah, but, very cool, alright, so your Game

1537
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:39,960
of the Week.

1538
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:43,680
And it's more Squeenix good, or more, it was actually just Squaresoft at the time.

1539
01:15:43,680 --> 01:15:48,680
The Game of the Week, Do Prism, also known as, what was it, Threads of Fate, Threads

1540
01:15:48,680 --> 01:15:49,680
of Fate.

1541
01:15:49,680 --> 01:15:51,640
I did not play this game, but I should.

1542
01:15:51,640 --> 01:15:52,640
You can borrow my copy.

1543
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:55,560
Because I played some of those other games you mentioned that came out, wasn't that also

1544
01:15:55,560 --> 01:15:59,280
the same time that horrible, horrible Mana game came out on PSP, it wasn't, that was

1545
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:00,280
Legend of Mana.

1546
01:16:00,280 --> 01:16:01,960
Legend of Mana, oh god, that game was awful.

1547
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:03,400
I hated Legend of Mana.

1548
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:09,080
I have the Japanese version of Legend of Mana, and I was like, too much text!

1549
01:16:09,080 --> 01:16:13,560
I read 30 Kanji, I can't read this game.

1550
01:16:13,560 --> 01:16:16,440
Now we're going to take a quick break, and we're going to come back in a little bit with

1551
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:19,200
more of Orange Laundrio, for those of you guys on the podcast, we'll be back in a couple

1552

01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:22,880
For those of you guys listening live, we'll be back in a little bit, and Loki, for some

1554
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:26,440
reason, appears to be hooking up the Nintendo Wii, I don't know what the hell this is going

1555
01:16:26,440 --> 01:16:30,440
to bring.

1556
01:16:30,440 --> 01:16:36,360
