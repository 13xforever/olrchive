00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,500
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:25,500
And welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio. We are live on this Sunday evening, December 2nd of 2007.

6
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,000
The year's almost up.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We'll be doing our year-end special before you know it. We'll announce more details on that in the upcoming weeks.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
When Dark Sakura returns to us, hopefully next week.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
But in the meantime, we get back into the gaming news for this week.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,500
And Loki's going to start us off.

11
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:46,000
Let's see. Let's start off with talking a little bit about the Xbox 360 Fall Dashboard Update.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
It's going to add a lot of fun things and now they've fleshed out all the details.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Including in the Dashboard Update, Divix support and Xvid support.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So now we can play all the porn that we downloaded on our computers on our 360. Hell yeah.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
And then of course the Xbox Live Arcade hits.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Those are going to be reduced price games that basically have been released before.

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Sold lots of copies and now you can buy them cheaper.

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I believe some of those Bank Shop Billiards.

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Two's going to be like 800 points.

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Luminous Live, 800 points.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And then there's going to be a couple for 400 like Zuma and stuff like that.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
But that's not really part of a Dashboard Update. That's just kind of a...

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Well the section that they're going to have for it.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
It's going to basically be...

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Oh they're going to have a whole section for it.

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Oh okay.

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Yeah so that's new.

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Other things that they're going to be changing. The marketplace is kind of getting a whole facelift.

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
They're going to have things sorted completely differently.

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
In fact they're going to also have...

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Are they going to make heads or tails of the movies on there?

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Because the movies... trying to find movies right now is not what you see.

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I don't know about the movies stuff.

34
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
But they're going to have this kind of thing where you can...

35
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I guess people are kind of calling it like a cross media bar.

36
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It's you know...

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Ways of sorting the live marketplace stuff.

38
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
They have a whole section for free shit. So that's kind of cool.

39
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Other things. Xbox Live Originals of course is coming up there.

40
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
The parental timer as well. Friends of Friends.

41
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
By the way the parental timer made the front page of Yahoo today.

42
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I don't know if you saw that.

43
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I don't know if you visit Yahoo but it's like my home page.

44
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
So it comes up and...

45
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It was mentioning...

46
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Oh the new Xbox will limit how much your kids can play games.

47
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Kind of interesting.

48
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
The Friends of Friends functionality where you can actually say for example...

49
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Rob I have a lot of people that are probably on your friends list that I don't have a friend into mine.

50
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
If you have that enabled I can look at your friends list.

51
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
See who's on and add people off that.

52
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Also there's going to be a section where you can add a bio to your user tag.

53
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Where you can actually have a thousand words or whatever in there.

54
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,000
There's also going to be a section where you can put your real name and where you're locating stuff if you wanted to.

55
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
If I want people to know that about me.

56
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
If you want people to know that about you.

57
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
What else do they have in there?

58
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I want to say I set that functionality to friends only earlier this week when the email went out.

59
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I don't know it's just a little weird.

60
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
So when are they going to let you...

61
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
They're trying to turn the Xbox into MySpace.

62
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
That's exactly what I was going to say.

63
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
In a way well I mean it's smart they're capitalizing on that whole social networking phenomenon.

64
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
But you know I don't know.

65
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's not MySpace.

66
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
It's really not.

67
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Can I remake my profile to look god awfully ugly and little like flash graphics and web bling and glitter graphics?

68
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I have a completely...

69
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Oh man we should have brought that up during the break.

70
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Never mind.

71
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'll bring it up maybe an afterword.

72
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Other things that they're changing too.

73
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,000
They're going to add a new Xbox Live blade where it's going to have RSS feeds.

74
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Including you know stuff from like Major Nelson and other tidbits of information.

75
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
And or advertisements.

76
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Let's see.

77
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Yeah I think that's pretty much it.

78
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
And of course this is all going to be available Tuesday.

79
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Nice.

80
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Yeah Frisbee says in chat room.

81
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
chat.orangesonshare.com

82
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Thanks for the ad.

83
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Can we start leaving notes on people's Xbox 360s.

84
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Hey thanks for the ad.

85
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Appreciate it.

86
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Comment back please.

87
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Like those god awful like glitter graphics that are like you know.

88
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
How are you doing?

89
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Happy Thanksgiving.

90
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
What's up sexy gal.

91
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Yeah I know.

92
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You're in the what is it the MySpace sexiest person alive award.

93
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Actually copy and paste this to 10 people or else you'll be ugly tomorrow.

94
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You know if you do have the Xbox Live vision camera you can send wonderful like pictures like that.

95
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You know you may have to take a picture of your computer monitor or something like that.

96
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You know with the image on there but you could you know.

97
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Or girls can just take pictures of their tits and guys can take pictures of their wangs.

98
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I mean that's.

99
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I approve all pictures of women's tits sent to my account on there.

100
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Not all of them.

101
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
You'll redirect the wangs to your wife.

102
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I'm just going to take a picture of someone pooing and be like this is what I think of

103
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
you.

104
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Stop posting this crap.

105
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I wonder if anyone's been banned like off of live yet for like inappropriate pictures

106
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
in their profile.

107
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Irene's going to send pictures of two girls one cup to her full friends list.

108
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Yes.

109
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Videos even.

110
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
You could make that your icon you know using the vision camera.

111
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You remember a while back when Microsoft was banning people for 24 hours for questionable

112
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
bio lines.

113
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I wonder if anybody's tried two girls one cup fan to see if that gets them banned.

114
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I don't see why that would be offensive just putting something like that.

115
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Because it's not offensive.

116
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Like oh my God you said two girls one cup.

117
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
We ban you.

118
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Anyhow.

119
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Moving on to other things that will soon be on Xbox Live.

120
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
BioShock.

121
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
We've all been waiting for some more content for the game BioShock and a patch is going

122
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
to be coming out soon.

123
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
It's actually going to have downloadable content with the patch.

124
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Or actually the patch is going to enable this download content.

125
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I assume isn't the patch supposed to fix the wide screen thing too or is that already been

126
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
done?

127
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
No it's going to do that.

128
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I see so that's the whole thing that this patch is fixing.

129
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,000
The new downloadable content will I assume be a new level or something but they don't

130
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
really say a lot about what it is.

131
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
New plasmids.

132
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Oh new plasmids.

133
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
New plasmids and there's supposed to be a new difficulty in there that's going to disable

134
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
the vitachambers.

135
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Nice.

136
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
So that's pretty cool.

137
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Guitar Hero 3 had a new download pack.

138
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:07,000
This time in the form of some indie love and included in there three songs from artists

139
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
you might not be familiar with.

140
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Including you get State of Massachusetts by Dropkick Murphys.

141
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Pretty good punk band.

142
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:23,000
You Should Be Ashamed of Myself by The Bled and Memories of the Groove by Maylene and

143
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Sons of Disasters.

144
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Now this is a pack for Guitar Hero 2.

145
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Oh Guitar Hero 2.

146
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Right?

147
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I was going to say yeah this is a pack for Guitar Hero 2 and that kind of made me go

148
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
well that's interesting because now Guitar Hero 3 is out but then you have to kind of

149
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
think about well oh yeah Guitar Hero 2 and 3 were kind of made by different companies

150
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
so.

151
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Yeah.

152
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
That threw me off.

153
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Right.

154
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You're fired Loki.

155
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Sorry.

156
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'll play Guitar Hero 3 right now.

157
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Alright.

158
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I'm not listening to Orange on the radio anymore.

159
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
You fired Loki.

160
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I'm quitting my song.

161
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
He fired me for a bad review of download content for Guitar Hero.

162
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Oh my god.

163
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Where's one up on my lawn?

164
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I do love this show sometimes.

165
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Other times it sucks.

166
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Which is like 99%.

167
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Xbox Live Arcade is going to be getting a classic game.

168
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Actually I thought we already had this game on Xbox Live.

169
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Chess is going to be coming to Xbox Live.

170
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Isn't that part of the Spyglass?

171
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Yeah.

172
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Chess Master though.

173
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I know.

174
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
It's Chess Master.

175
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Specifically the Chess Master series which was a huge series on PC from what I remember.

176
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Like every year there was a new Chess Master game.

177
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Yeah.

178
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
But all I know is that it isn't Battle Chess.

179
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
So for that, epic fail.

180
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Or Battleship.

181
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I want Battleship in life.

182
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Battleship is kind of hokey.

183
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Why are you beeping over there?

184
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I'm not.

185
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
My new phone is.

186
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Because someone sunk her Battleship apparently.

187
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Yeah.

188
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Chess Master is going to be coming to Xbox Live Arcade.

189
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Hopefully it's a little better and a little polished than the Spyglass thing was.

190
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It's supposed to have lots of different AI opponents of varying difficulty.

191
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
We'll see.

192
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Camera support as well.

193
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
So we'll see.

194
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:12,000
And I would say coming to Xbox Live Arcade very soon would be the most ironic name of

195
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
the game I'd say.

196
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
The sensible world of soccer.

197
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I don't know about you but I don't think the world of soccer is very sensible.

198
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
That's a real game.

199
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I know.

200
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
That's why I'm laughing.

201
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
It's like when I think of sensible, I think of soccer.

202
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I don't know.

203
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Soccer fans are pretty rowdy sometimes.

204
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
The game actually looked kind of fun.

205
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I saw a trailer.

206
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I never played this game.

207
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
As much of a Commodore fan as I was back in the day, I didn't have Amiga.

208
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I only ever had a Commodore 64.

209
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I never really played this game.

210
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Anyway, Sensible World of Soccer is coming to Xbox Live Arcade on December 19th.

211
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Wow.

212
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
So, hooray.

213
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Be excited.

214
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I don't know.

215
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You know me, stupid American, don't like soccer.

216
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Dark Tetsuya says it looks like a Game Boy Color game.

217
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
It doesn't look like a Game Boy Color game, but it does look like a Super Nintendo game.

218
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
It looks like an older computer system, you know?

219
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Hey, yeah.

220
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
It's supposed to look a little older.

221
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Some of the games on Live Arcade look a little crappy because they're old 80s game ports,

222
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
but hey, it might play better than Pro Evo 2008.

223
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Well, yeah, because it's sensible.

224
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Well, also on the Xbox 360, this week it already happened a brand new backwards compatibility update.

225
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Some folks were thinking that this fell off the face of the earth,

226
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
that they were never going to release new updates for backwards compatibility again, but it happened.

227
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
They added 84 new games to the backwards compatibility list.

228
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,000
There are now 465 games that are backwards compatible.

229
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Some of the highlights of games that are now in there,

230
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Blitz the League, Blood Omen 2, Burnout 2, Point of Impact,

231
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Fight Night Round 3, Forgotten Realms Demon Stone,

232
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Freedom Fighters, a lot of sports games like MVP Baseball,

233
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:07,000
03, 04, 05, NCAA March Madness, 05, 06,

234
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:15,000
a lot of NHL games, 2K3, 05, 2K3 is on there twice, I think they cheated.

235
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
NHL 2K3.

236
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Oh, there's NFL and NHL, my bad, one letter off.

237
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Playboy the Mansion, I'm sure a lot of folks are looking forward to that.

238
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Here's the one game on the entire list that I actually own for whatever reason,

239
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Tecmo Classic Arcade is now backwards compatible as well.

240
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I know Loki owns this game, this is worth noting, The Guy Game.

241
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I don't own it on Xbox, though.

242
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Oh, really?

243
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I don't technically own it either.

244
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I thought you bought it on PlayStation 2 or something.

245
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Yeah, bought it.

246
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Yeah, all right.

247
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Quote, end quote.

248
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Worms 3D, I don't know if you're a fan of the Worms series, Loki.

249
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Worms is fun.

250
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
There you have it.

251
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Not the 3D Worms.

252
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Not playable still, games such as Advent Rising,

253
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Dance Dance Revolution series still not playable, backwards compatible.

254
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Wow, I should be clamoring to get an Xbox 360.

255
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Beyond Good and Evil, I think.

256
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
All right.

257
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Anyways.

258
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
One interesting thing, the Xbox Live Video Marketplace

259
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
is going to be coming to Europe pretty soon.

260
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
And this is actually coming from one of those prepaid cards.

261
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Apparently, written on the back in very small print,

262
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,000
said you can access the Xbox Live Video Marketplace

263
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
available in the UK, Ireland, France, and Germany.

264
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
So apparently this hasn't happened soon,

265
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
the cards now being already printed have that information on there.

266
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
So soon you will be able to watch videos

267
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
and enjoy all the rest of the download content

268
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
that we have around the world.

269
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Be excited.

270
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I'm not.

271
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I don't know if you saw this hit the internet earlier this week,

272
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
but there was a video that went out on the internet

273
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
that it was kind of a social experiment, I guess you could call it,

274
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
a guy whose nickname was X Gay Boy X

275
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
signed on to Halo 3.

276
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Triple X Gay Boy X.

277
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Sorry about that.

278
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
He signed on to Halo 3

279
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
and basically got all these people to say really,

280
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I mean, I shouldn't say he,

281
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
because that makes it sound like he provoked it,

282
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,000
but people would respond to his name and taunt him.

283
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I'd love to see it.

284
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Irene wants to see a little clip of this.

285
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I don't know if legally we can play the whole thing.

286
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Yeah, we should.

287
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
That's long.

288
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I don't want to play the whole thing.

289
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Yeah, don't play the whole thing.

290
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I just want to see interesting things.

291
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
We'll play some clips.

292
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
We'll play some clips for Rice Princess.

293
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Have your dad give you bloody butt again, faggot.

294
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Yeah, fuck you, Gay Boy, you piece of shit.

295
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Gay Boy, quit sucking off dudes and play.

296
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Gay Boy.

297
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Gay Boy.

298
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Gay Boy.

299
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Fucking Gay Boy.

300
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Hey, what's up, Gay Boy?

301
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
We should hook up.

302
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I'm Friendly Uncle.

303
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Gay Boy and Friendly Uncle coming at you.

304
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Something that should be noted,

305
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
because you notice that isn't so bad.

306
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
There are a few things in here that are not necessarily negative, for instance,

307
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
but who knows if it's somebody.

308
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:16,000
You know how sometimes jocks in high school would befriend the nerds on a dare type thing?

309
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Yeah.

310
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
You don't know.

311
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Maybe it's something like that, but I doubt it.

312
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
It seems pretty genuine.

313
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
One, two, punch.

314
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Hope gay marriage never gets passed.

315
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Have fun being single.

316
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Well, we'll make it to a single boy.

317
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Shut the fuck up.

318
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
You're still a faggot.

319
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Well, it doesn't matter, dude.

320
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I'm sorry.

321
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
You're not a faggot.

322
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
You give a bad name to gays.

323
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
You're a fucking nuke.

324
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
You're a niggit.

325
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Don't worry, guys.

326
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Ah, there you go.

327
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
That's enough.

328
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Wow.

329
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
If I hadn't already heard all this stuff before in games,

330
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I'd probably be a little more shocked, but that's still very perturbing.

331
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
It's really like, I don't know.

332
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Well, I don't know.

333
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
You'd think I'd have a strong opinion on this because I am the gay host here

334
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
on Orange Launch Radio.

335
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Yeah, that's just Halo for you.

336
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Whatever, gay boy.

337
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I watched this clip, and I was just tapping my fingers.

338
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
And don't get me wrong.

339
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
This is incredibly fucked up, but in my mind, it's kind of like,

340
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
it's not news.

341
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
This is why Xbox Live is infamous.

342
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Hello and welcome to the internet.

343
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Where have you been for years?

344
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I mean, in a way, I'm a little bit torn because yes,

345
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I think these people are really fucked up, and yes,

346
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I think it's fucking sad that there's ignorant people like that out there,

347
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
but at the same time, it's a little bit entrapment or provoking it

348
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
when the guy goes on there with a name like, you know, gay boy.

349
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
But I don't see it that way.

350
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Why does it have to be seen as entrapment if you have a name like gay boy?

351
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I'm a hetero boy.

352
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I would be interested to see what hetero boy would...

353
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Yeah, like, that's dumb.

354
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I don't know.

355
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Like, on the one hand, I'm infuriated.

356
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I'm kind of like livid that people would say that kind of stuff.

357
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Or I heart Jesus or something like that.

358
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Yeah, but at the same time, it's just kind of like, well, you know,

359
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
successful.

360
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
It was funny, though.

361
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
This is why I only like to play with friends and OLR listeners.

362
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I want to say like Fox News or somebody ran some sort of report on this

363
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
and they were talking about like...

364
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I saw that about the trash talk.

365
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Yeah, there's some other YouTube out there.

366
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Yeah, Fox just did a report this week.

367
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I saw that.

368
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
And the whole thing was like they're all, you know,

369
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
are you guys surprised that this is on there?

370
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
And they're like, no.

371
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
And then like I remember reading some comments on that and they're like,

372
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
yeah, of course they're not surprised.

373
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
They're the ones fucking saying that shit.

374
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
They're going to be like 12-year-olds and stuff, 13-year-olds.

375
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Now, the reason why I want to bring this up is that, you know,

376
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
obviously these things make their way around the Internet.

377
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:48,000
And if anybody, Microsoft, has proven they're very good about kind of

378
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
staying on top of the Internet buzz and trying to plomp this mob mentality

379
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
when they see it.

380
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
And, you know, one of their representatives, Trixie,

381
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
was actually posting on the GayGamer.net blog post where this showed up

382
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
and just trying to kind of, you know, say,

383
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
hey, I think these guys are assholes too.

384
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
And when you see this happen, report it because we do follow up on that shit.

385
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
And Major Nelson basically kind of says the same thing.

386
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Major Nelson posts about it in his blog and says,

387
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I just watched or listened to the video you posted on your site.

388
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
This is what he wrote back to GayGamer.net who posted the original thing.

389
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Needless to say, it was disappointing to see how some Xbox Live members behaved.

390
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
As you know, that's not the type of behavior we support.

391
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
With over 8 million members, it's unfortunate that some members decide to act like this.

392
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I want to point out a few things that all Xbox Live members can do

393
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
to ensure an enjoyable experience.

394
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
And reiterates, you know, you can turn off voice from people that aren't your friends,

395
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
only play with friends, file complaints.

396
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
And he reiterates, we do act on complaints,

397
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
so I highly encourage people to file complaints where appropriate.

398
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
And you know what? I do that.

399
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
When I play on Xbox Live, if somebody is being annoying,

400
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
because some people will get, I swear to God,

401
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
you'll get on Halo 3 and you'll get into some matches

402
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
and somebody will be doing this the whole time.

403
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I swear to God, for the entire match, somebody did that to me once.

404
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
That's kind of funny.

405
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Then if I ever met that person in real life, I'd punch him.

406
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I muted the little fucker, finally, so he was just sitting there by himself.

407
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Maybe he had a mental problem.

408
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
That's what I was going to say.

409
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Maybe he had a headache.

410
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I don't think the mental problem was that severe because he was kicking my ass in Halo.

411
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Maybe he's like Rain Man or something.

412
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,000
He's really good at Halo, but he just says meh meh meh meh a lot.

413
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
That could be his thing, but yeah.

414
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I muted him and then I rated the fucker down.

415
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
You go into the little thing and you can rate.

416
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
You know how everybody on Xbox Live has a five-star rating?

417
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Not if you play with me in Halo 3.

418
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I'll rate you down so fast if you get on there and say something nasty.

419
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I had somebody get on there going n-word, n-word, n-word over and over

420
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
and I reported it as abuse.

421
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
That's just disgusting.

422
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
It's gross.

423
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Why do you have to say that?

424
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
It's because Mommy and Daddy aren't looking and they're acting out

425
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
to make themselves feel better about themselves.

426
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
It's because Mommy and Daddy bought them an M-rated game

427
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
and obviously aren't paying attention to what they're doing

428
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
and they'll pay for their damn live account

429
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
because it gives Mommy and Daddy a few moments to breathe

430
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
and make more babies.

431
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Frisbee brings up a good point.

432
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Is he a cat?

433
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Oh God, I hope I wasn't getting my ass kicked by a cat.

434
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Laser cat.

435
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
That would be kind of sad.

436
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I think I'd have to quit video gaming forever.

437
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Man, that must be a stupid cat.

438
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Meow, meow, meow, meow.

439
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
You can't even meow right.

440
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Shut up, cat.

441
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I'm muting you.

442
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Hey, my cat couldn't meow right for a while.

443
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
It took her time to figure out.

444
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I know.

445
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I really had to restrain myself from meowing.

446
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Stupid faggot cat, stop meowing so fucking much.

447
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
N-word, n-word cat, geez.

448
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Black cat, what's that, huh?

449
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
That's terrible.

450
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Sephiroth1215 says something else really good.

451
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Listen to these people, though.

452
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
They're not really 12 and 13.

453
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
These people are usually in their 20s.

454
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Yeah, those people did sound a little bit older,

455
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
but they sounded like pigs, too.

456
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
They sounded like frat boys in a dorm room.

457
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Gay boy.

458
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Look at this.

459
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I just totally told this guy.

460
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Man, I'm awesome.

461
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Dorm rules.

462
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
See, and they all have lame nicknames, too.

463
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
It's usually like, oh, halo lover and stuff like that,

464
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
or like, I love unicorns or something.

465
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Like, how could you make fun of a name, gay boy?

466
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Master Chief is my butt buddy.

467
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Exactly.

468
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
And he really is.

469
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
They're stupid.

470
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
They can't think of anything more creative,

471
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
like a more creative way to make fun of someone,

472
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
instead of gay boy.

473
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Oh, you're gay, and you're a boy.

474
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
It's stupid.

475
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
But the parts of it that are really singing to me

476
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
is that people will suddenly jump on there,

477
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
and then they'll be like, I hope gay marriage is banned forever

478
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
and you're single forever.

479
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
It's like, dude.

480
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Like, wow.

481
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
It's just some guy on the internet playing Halo.

482
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Oh, that hurt my ego.

483
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I can't fight back in Halo now.

484
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Oh, man.

485
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
What am I to do?

486
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
But then Nintendo looks at this shit and goes,

487
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
that's why we've got friend codes.

488
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Oh, Nintendo's so smart.

489
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I don't know about that.

490
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Anyhow.

491
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Kicking you, kicking you.

492
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
So even more ridiculous news here.

493
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Apparently, there is a guy filing a class action lawsuit

494
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,000
because he believes that Microsoft created defective copies

495
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:45,000
of Halo 3 that are causing Xbox 360s to blow up everywhere.

496
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
No, that wasn't Microsoft.

497
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
That was me.

498
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Anyways, apparently, this guy out of San Diego,

499
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Randy Nunez, is going ahead with a lawsuit against them.

500
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Apparently, he purchased a copy of Halo 3 from GameStop

501
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,000
and was plagued by system lockups and freezes and crashes

502
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
when he tried to play it.

503
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Well, where's the explosions?

504
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
When you say that the...

505
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I was being sarcastic.

506
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Blow up the 360.

507
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I'm thinking I played Halo.

508
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Sarcasm.

509
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Close it and then suddenly tick, tick, tick.

510
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Boom.

511
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Sarcasm.

512
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Rad.

513
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I'll be actually kind of rad.

514
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I'd buy another one.

515
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
No, he...

516
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I would not.

517
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Did he try a different copy of the game,

518
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
return a defective one to GameStop for replacement?

519
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
That, the story doesn't say.

520
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
You know he was using a 360.

521
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
So, but here's the thing, though.

522
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
But, I mean, this is a bunch of bullshit anyways

523
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
because I remember this story came out, like, you know,

524
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
before that, oh, maybe Halo's breaking systems.

525
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
No, it actually is because you're playing the game

526
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
so much that your system's overheating

527
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
if you happen to have that overheating problem

528
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
and then you get three rings of death or whatever.

529
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
It's stupid.

530
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
And the fact that this guy's going to sue for this shit,

531
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I hope he fails.

532
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
But, you know, unfortunately nowadays

533
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
a lot of times these people succeed, so.

534
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
And, of course, whenever we hear about the frivolous lawsuits

535
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
we get a little bit angsty.

536
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
And nothing inspires our next segment like frivolous lawsuits.

537
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
It's time to bring on the FUs of the week.

538
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Music

539
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Hey, I guess I would say this is a pre-FU

540
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
for my work review that's going to be this week

541
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,000
which I'm demanding a raise, which I'm sure I will not get.

542
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
But I haven't gotten one in three years

543
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
and I'm well deserving of one

544
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
since I have four times the accounts

545
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,000
that certain other sales reps do at my company.

546
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
So basically my whole thing is I'm going to go in there

547
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
and just say, okay, am I getting a review or not?

548
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
And if I'm not, then I'm going to be a complete asshole.

549
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
You should.

550
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
So fuck you stupid managers at my work

551
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
that aren't willing to pay me a decent salary.

552
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I'm already underpaid as it is.

553
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
If I get a fucking raise,

554
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,000
then I'll be just slightly less underpaid.

555
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
I'll go next.

556
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
My FU of the week goes to the fact that I don't own a house.

557
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I rent, but I don't own

558
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
because I went to a party last night with William.

559
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
These guys own this house.

560
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
It was just beautiful what they've done with it.

561
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,000
The backyard was all like an island getaway.

562
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I mean, seriously,

563
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
they had spent obviously a lot of time remodeling this place.

564
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I'm just like, I want a house that's cool.

565
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Don't get me wrong.

566
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I love this house, but I can't really change it

567
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
because it's not mine.

568
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Does that make sense?

569
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
So FU to not owning a house.

570
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I'll be rich one day, damn it.

571
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
One of these days.

572
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Yeah, that's right.

573
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Rice Princess, do you have anything?

574
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,000
FU to cats that can't meow properly.

575
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
They need to make a speech.

576
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Shut up, cat.

577
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Yeah, that's it.

578
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
All right.

579
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
That does it for the FUs of the week.

580
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
That was really short.

581
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Wow.

582
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Usually there's a lot of angst built up for this.

583
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
It's because we stopped reading chat FUs.

584
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
They say we got a lot shorter.

585
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Wow, that lasted like a minute and a half.

586
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Black Lab's in chat and says, an internet radio will not be getting you a house, Rob.

587
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Truer words have not been spoken.

588
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Wait a minute, what?

589
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
What?

590
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Non-believer?

591
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
What?

592
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Where's that?

593
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Is that a chat name or something?

594
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
No, an internet radio will not be getting you a house, Rob.

595
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
So you think you don't know.

596
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Rob, what?

597
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Geez.

598
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I have to-

599
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
No, Eidos is building me a house because I'm-

600
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
I have to divert our attention real quick because there's the last minute story.

601
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
And I need you to pull this up.

602
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Gamersreports.com.

603
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
This better be good.

604
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Has a brand new trailer.

605
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
For?

606
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
For Africa.

607
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Gamersreports.com?

608
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Yeah, Gamers, with an S, reports.com.

609
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Aha.

610
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Oh.

611
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
New Africa.

612
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
A New Africa trailer for the PS3.

613
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
I think we should watch.

614
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Is this real or is this something to be-

615
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
No, it's real.

616
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
And it has a song.

617
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:26,000
I want to know what is worthy about interrupting the show with this.

618
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Do we get to find out what the hell you do in this game?

619
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I don't know.

620
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I didn't watch the whole trailer.

621
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Oh.

622
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,220
I don't have a

623
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:58,000

626
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,720

whoopty-doo all right i'm waiting an eager and your solid five

643
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:45,440
let's move on to the gaming news shall we and uh you know here on

644
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,960
orange entre do we like to talk about the current systems and everything the

645
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:53,280
kids are playing so that's why this next article is about the commodore 64 whoa

646
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:59,520
radical and uh yes on the commodore 64 somebody with a lot of free time has

647
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:04,240
managed to make a guitar hero clone type thing for the commodore 64

648
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:08,000
now i shouldn't say it's a full game yet it's still in its concept stages but

649
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,920
it's called shreds 64 and what they did is they took

650
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:15,280
their playstation 2 guitar and basically adapted it so that it can

651
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:19,200
be read in the uh joystick ports and uh yeah now they've made it so that

652
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,640
you know the notes fall and it reads the guitar and they have

653
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,400
what's called the shredocity and the applause and the applause is

654
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,840
basically the uh meter you know um how well you're doing just like in

655
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:34,400
the game and i guess shredocity is uh kind of like your you know when you tilt

656
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:37,360
up your uh crowd crowd meter or whatever

657
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:41,760
crowd boost stuff so shredos yes your shredocity that is

658
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:46,400
so rad i like that a lot so somebody yeah you're a commodore 64 fangirl aren't

659
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,640
you i kind of am yeah it started off with this

660
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,640
little tech demo where somebody did this and

661
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,560
the it was able to recognize the controller strum up strum down

662
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:58,720
lifting up all that stuff kind of neat loki i'm surprised you're not into this

663
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,520
kind of stuff then again it is commodore 64 i know that's not your thing

664
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:05,520
that's commodore 64 ain't my thing still kind of cool

665
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:09,360
i like it i approve of this project me too thumbs up

666
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:13,120
anyway i'm disappointed to see that we don't have a dreamcast game yet

667
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:16,320
of like you know guitar hero or something like that

668
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:20,080
because you know the dreamcast has tons of games coming out for some reason even

669
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:24,480
though you know sure enough uh anyways um

670
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,600
another mod also kind of dealing with a music game

671
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,640
um rock band as you remember me complaining about

672
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:35,040
the drums and how loud they were apparently a lot of people are looking

673
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:38,880
for homebrew ways of making them quieter and there's a couple

674
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,480
different methods that you can use out there

675
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,000
uh one of which is self self-adhesive rubber

676
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:50,000
and self-adhesive colored felt and you basically shove that on there and it

677
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,160
doesn't have to be colored felt just so that you know you know which

678
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,080
color because if you're covering the whole drum

679
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:00,000
you're not going to know what color is what you don't have to you can do all

680
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,360
black if you're emo like that i mean so whatever but um there's another

681
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:09,680
one i saw also there was a rubber mouse pad

682
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:14,320
and you glue that on there so apparently though it works pretty well

683
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:17,920
and um reducing the sound i guess by um

684
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:23,360
70 well there you go maybe the wife will let you play if you can reduce the sound

685
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:27,200
she oh by the way um she bought rock band for me

686
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:31,280
or she gave me a check for because i paid with it my money but she only

687
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:34,560
she only paid for 100 of it because she says that the remainder of the money

688
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:38,400
would have been for the drum kit and she's not supporting the drum kit

689
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:43,280

well uh if you've been following the entertainment world at all which i'm

694
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:01,040
sure many of you folks that play video games also enjoy the occasional movie or

695
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:03,120
tv show and i'm sure you are aware of the

696
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,440
current writers guild strike that's going on

697
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,960
uh which is you know gonna kind of end some of your favorite shows a little

698
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:13,840
early this year like heroes next week's battle star galactica is that

699
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,720
is that something like some no something's getting postponed it might

700
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:20,560
even be all together cancelled what because of this damn strike they can't

701
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:28,320
they can't cancel battle star they can be sure shit can be honest with heroes

702
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,800
man i think that's actually kind of good for

703
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:34,160
them no i i think heroes has been just fine this season

704
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:37,360
there's it's it was slow to develop like the first season

705
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:41,760
but the past few episodes have been amazing it's all right and l is awesome

706
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:45,040
i swear to god if they kill her off monday i'm gonna be so pissed anyway

707
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:50,320
um well obviously the right what i said two of them are supposed to die

708
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:54,240
yeah don't remind me all right and l probably no

709
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:59,200
writer's strike uh is going on well one thing that they are not striking against

710
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:04,960
is video games and uh the writer's guild is allowed to write for video games

711
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:10,240
currently while the strike is going on so um something to think about they are

712
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,560
allowing the members to work on games during the strike that's

713
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:15,840
that could be a good thing because honestly some of these games could use a

714
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:19,680
few better writers so i say uh this is a good thing for the

715
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:23,920
video game industry bad for tv movies good for video games

716
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:30,320
so anyways um another good thing that's good for video

717
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:33,520
games is using topless models to promote them

718
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:37,760
and that's what ea did for their european ad campaign

719
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:41,360
where they use two sexy models that were naked to

720
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:47,840
you know promote the game i approve okay did you guys see the new we commercial

721
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:51,760
for what game was it where they're kind of

722
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:56,640
like sort of parodying um fast times at richmont high where the

723
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:01,040
girls coming out of the um pool and they're like in bikinis and

724
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,440
what game was it promoting i don't know but like

725
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:09,680
nintendo's using sex to sell like what's going on here wholesome nintendo

726
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:13,280
putting girls in bikinis maybe they finally figured out that sex sells i

727
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,920
don't know girls in bikinis i don't yeah they're

728
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:20,400

729
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:23,760

733
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,880

734
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:46,160
say it's the publisher not nintendo yeah that would be a third party publisher

735
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:52,560
okay yeah that's like mario galaxy now with more nipples

00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,960
i forgot what i don't know because every time they

769
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,840
show the national geographic ladies with their boobies

770
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:20,560
they're like flat and not always i've seen some big boobies

771
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:24,560
i'm seeing that i know i'm like this conversation is not going to a happy

772
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:30,400
place it's true so let's talk about uh toys

773
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:34,960
and children's toys okay and uh that you know what like all these toys have been

774
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,360
getting recalled this year like the uh what was the

775
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:40,560
oh god what was that the dots thing that had a

776
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:44,720
date rape drug in it apparently oh no no it was something you could use as an

777
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:48,000
ingredient in creating the date rape drug if you eat it

778
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,200
oh that's right yeah the same effect what was that called the dots or

779
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:54,000
whatever we need a bunch of that the hell was

780
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,400
why you just want to eat it i don't want to eat it

781
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,320
i want to make dot creations you want to make the cat eat it and see what happens

782
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:04,000
oh no i wouldn't i wouldn't make sure kitty eat that that's mean

783
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
That would go, mama mama.

784
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Yeah.

785
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Awkward kitty.

786
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Awkward dots.

787
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Thank you, Raven's Dolphin.

788
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Awkward dots.

789
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
That's what they were called.

790
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Well, anyhow, according to a recent article in the Los Angeles Time, apparently because

791
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:25,000
of all these recalls, apparently game publishers are seeing a 19% increase in sales because

792
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:31,000
I guess games are safe and they're not going to try to drug your children as you are aware.

793
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,000
They'll just show them pictures of murder and everything like that, you know?

794
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Pictures of murder, yes.

795
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Like, murder.

796
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
You remember Manhunt 2 is murder.

797
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Murder Sims.

798
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Anyhow, listen, we don't need to give Manhunt 2 any more press.

799
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
I mean, the game's not that good.

800
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Anyway, this is coming from a quote from Jarek Johnson, who's an analyst from Capital Markets,

801
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
says, there's definitely money leaving the toy sector.

802
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:03,000
It's logical to assume that video games might be viewed by some parents as an alternative.

803
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,000
He's an analyst.

804
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Why you gotta take this show to the Toilet Rice Princess?

805
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
I don't know.

806
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Anyhow, anyways.

807
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Just an impulse.

808
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Yeah.

809
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
This picture's naughty.

810
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Anyways, sorry.

811
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
What are you doing over there on your laptop?

812
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
You don't have to announce it on the show.

813
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Yeah, this picture's naughty.

814
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Oh yeah, that's real butter.

815
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,000
No, anyways, completely off topic here.

816
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Space Invaders Extreme is being released for the Nintendo DS in Japan.

817
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
And why should I even mention this?

818
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Because, you know, hey, it's Space Invaders and it's a remake.

819
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
It actually looks pretty cool.

820
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:51,000
It kind of incorporates music a little bit to it, and they have a YouTube video on Joystick right now.

821
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Worth checking out.

822
00:39:52,000 --> 00:40:00,000
And it reminds me a lot of Rez or even, like, Luminous a little bit.

823
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Really?

824
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Yeah, it's really cool looking, actually.

825
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,000
So, you know, if it comes out over here, I'm definitely going to have to check it out.

826
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
But, you know, it kind of changes a little bit of the pacing of the game and stuff.

827
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
They have power-ups and stuff you can get.

828
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:17,000
But, you know, each ship that you blow up kind of, you know, adds beats to the music and stuff.

829
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
So it's pretty cool.

830
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
It's got a little, like, trippy background and stuff, too.

831
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Is it based on, also, the BPM?

832
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Kind of like how they did on Vibrib and, like, the speed of the stuff coming towards you?

833
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Um, I don't know about that, but it just looks really cool, though.

834
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
That would be cool.

835
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Mm-hmm.

836
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Yeah.

837
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Yep.

838
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
All right.

839
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Well, let's go ahead and move on to our mailbag segment.

840
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
That's right.

841
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Every week you guys send us emails at mailbag at orangehontrader.com.

842
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
We're going to open up the mailbag and choose a few of our favorites.

843
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Since Dark Sakura is not here this week, I will be doing the honors, whether you like it or not.

844
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
I am, too.

845
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Too bad.

846
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Email number one this week comes to us from...

847
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
I don't know.

848
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
They didn't sign it.

849
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:09,000
We're going to say this is from Richard M.

850
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
He says, all right, I'm listening right now.

851
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Apparently, this person's listening to the show right now.

852
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
I'm playing Halo 3 and blah, blah, blah.

853
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
I just wanted to say hi because I haven't listened for about four weeks.

854
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:23,000
I just got an Xbox 360 and Xbox Live, and I sent a request to you two, Sky and Loki and Dark Sakura.

855
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Who's not there right now, but let her know.

856
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Will do, but I'm sure she'll see the friend's request when she logs in next.

857
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
I'm still adding most of the other OLR members, but most are pending right now.

858
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,000
But I would like to know which good games I should get.

859
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:39,000
I mean, I only have Fear, Condemned, Halo 3, and Guitar Hero 2.

860
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Give me at least three games you guys think would be great.

861
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
I'll play anything but sports games.

862
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Okay, that wraps it up.

863
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Until later, guys, see ya.

864
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Two thumbs up for you guys.

865
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Three games.

866
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Well, if you like Guitar Hero 2, you probably should get Guitar Hero 3.

867
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,000
If you like RPGs, get either Eternal Sonata or maybe Blue Dragon.

868
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,000
I don't know, try the demo first because that's getting some extra views.

869
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:07,000
I don't know, it's kind of a hit or miss thing.

870
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Let's see.

871
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:13,000
I don't know how into shooters you are, but BioShock's pretty awesome.

872
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
If you want to try a shooter, BioShock.

873
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Yeah, if you're playing Halo 3, I said get BioShock.

874
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,000
And if you're looking for cheap shit, I would say Earth Defense Force 2017.

875
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
It's 1999 now.

876
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Seriously, you deserve to play that game.

877
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:35,000
I mean, I understand it's really cheesy and stupid, but it draws me in, and I don't know why.

878
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Anything else?

879
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:45,000
I would say also, well, these are a bit older, but even Saints Row's not bad, or Crackdown.

880
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Crackdown I liked.

881
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
All right.

882
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Next email, shall we?

883
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,000
This is from Tensei Noob, emails us.

884
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Dear OLR crew, I have a few comments and one request.

885
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
First of all, the necessary praise.

886
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:04,000
I continue to admire your devotion to the show and quite impressed that you managed to release such a funny, informative podcast each week.

887
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
This podcast is funny.

888
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
And informative.

889
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:15,000
You know, I always worry each week that I'm just kind of being, you know, kind of breezing over stories and just being too much of an ass and just like talking randomness.

890
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
I don't even know what I'm saying half the time.

891
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
I know.

892
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
I don't know how much quality I put into this.

893
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,000
We start to feel we're slipping a little bit, so thank you for your kind words.

894
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
It helps our egos.

895
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Untrue words.

896
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Now that that's out of the way, a while ago you were talking about zombie games.

897
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Not that you don't frequently anyway, but ironic considering our Game of the Week.

898
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
But this is an especially concentrated instance.

899
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,000
And you were discussing how it would be great to have a game where you are the zombie.

900
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Have you ever heard of the game Stubbs the Zombie, Rebel Without a Pulse?

901
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Yes, unfortunately I haven't. It's a really crappy game.

902
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,000
I tried a demo of it once and it wasn't revolutionary, but it wasn't horrible either.

903
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,000
You control a zombie who can eat brains, turning the victims into zombie minions.

904
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Take off his hand and take control of others and produce toxic farts.

905
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Oh, this game sounds classy.

906
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Anyway, I thought you might appreciate knowing about a game where you actually get to be a zombie instead of always shooting them.

907
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,000
But you weren't a big fan of that, Loki?

908
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,000
It just got horrible reviews. It was a bad game.

909
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,000
It had a funny premise to it, but...

910
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Alright.

911
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Secondly, again referring a number of episodes back, I would like to state that Halo 3's story does make sense.

912
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:30,000
But you really need to have played the previous games and maybe even have read the books to fully comprehend it.

913
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:36,000
If you need any clarification, I am perfectly willing to help clear up any confusion, as I am yet another devoted Halo fan.

914
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:44,000
On a related note, I completed Halo 3 first time through on Legendary in three days, so I can also provide any gameplay advice you may require, especially for later levels.

915
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Okay, my advice I need, how do I not suck so bad at it?

916
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,000
You can't. It's impossible.

917
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:55,000
It's just like I was thinking about buying Unreal Tournament 3.

918
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:01,000
For some reason I thought there was a single player mode in it, but I'm an idiot because Unreal Tournament does not have single player.

919
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Well, I mean, it does, but it's still fucking Unreal Tournament, you know?

920
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
I was like, ooh, I can make mods and stuff. Mods are cool.

921
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Because I'm thinking like Quake, you know, back when they had mods like Kujo and the grappling hook.

922
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Because I love Kujo and the grappling hook.

923
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
I know, I'm weird.

924
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,000
But I'm not going to buy that game anymore.

925
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Well, you know, also I want to say about the whole Halo 3 story thing, I think there was a great video floating around out there that was basically Halo 1 and 2's story kind of condensed into a few minutes.

926
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
That was something you could watch to catch up.

927
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:36,000
I have the collector's edition, I just haven't watched any of the videos on that second disc.

928
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Aren't you glad you spent all that extra money?

929
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Hey, the only reason I bought the collector's edition was for the video calibration tool.

930
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
That is the only reason.

931
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
And ironically enough, I have not used the video calibration tool.

932
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
You tool!

933
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Ouch.

934
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Alright, moving on.

935
00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Next email comes to us from Johnny S. because they didn't sign it.

936
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Remember, if you don't sign your emails, I don't know what to call you, so I'll just use your first name and last initial.

937
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Loki, I have a question.

938
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,000
I'm thinking about buying an 80 gigabyte PlayStation 3.

939
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:14,000
I've got to have Metal Gear Solid 4 and Grand Theft 5, no, I'm sorry, Gran Turismo 5.

940
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,000
But other than that, is there anything else that warrants my 600 bucks?

941
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Maybe Resistance, Fallen Man, and depending on what kind of games you like, maybe Uncharted.

942
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Ratchet and Clank, you know, my friend's been playing tons of Ratchet and Clank, and I've watched him play a little bit of it.

943
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
I'm just not that impressed by it.

944
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,000
But then again, I didn't play any of the other Ratchet and Clank games.

945
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:39,000
I don't know, he loves Ratchet and Clank, he loves that game, so maybe that game.

946
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Heavenly Sword, maybe.

947
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
The Blu-Ray player?

948
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Blu-Ray's good, if you like online shooter games, maybe like Warhawk might be good.

949
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:53,000
You know, there's stuff out there definitely, but not as much as maybe like Xbox 360.

950
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,000
But just, you know, wait, be patient about it, I guess.

951
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:01,000
And if you can get your hands on the 60 gig system, you'll probably appreciate that a lot better.

952
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Because to be honest, you know, you don't really need the extra hard drive space right now.

953
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,000
There really is not a lot to download on there.

954
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Is there anything on the PlayStation Network worth getting?

955
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Yeah, the first thing you need to get is a Japanese account, that's for sure.

956
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:26,000
You can do that for free, so I recommend looking up on the internet to get a Japanese account and do that.

957
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Because when you do that, you'll really get some really kickass demos from Japan.

958
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,000
You'll also be able to download the Gran Turismo 5 prologue demo,

959
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:39,000
and especially if you're interested in Gran Turismo 5, and stuff like that.

960
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Because they get a lot of demos and stuff that we don't get out over here.

961
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:50,000
So do that. If you want to check out some of the games that are on there, like Flow is pretty fun,

962
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Everyday Shooter is supposed to be good, Pain just came up.

963
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:58,000
That might be something I like, but I don't know.

964
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:04,000
And then maybe if you're into Tekken 5, they have the Tekken 5 multiplayer online game.

965
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
And you know what game I strongly recommend?

966
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:11,000
It's Africa!

967
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:15,000
I love playing that game, it's less than a condition.

968
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
That's the only way I'm playing that game.

969
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:20,000
I gotta say, despite all the smack we're talking about, the game looks fucking gorgeous.

970
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Yeah, it looks awesome.

971
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
This is like a game I can just sit and look at.

972
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Yeah, and you know what else I can sit and look at?

973
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Discovery Channel HD.

974
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
And porn.

975
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:34,000
I don't just look at games, I like to play them too.

976
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,000
But there are a lot of people that do like to just watch other people play games.

977
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Anyway, we've got to move on and get to some more emails.

978
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Furgatron writes us and says,

979
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,000
I know this email is late, but I'm seriously behind my list of podcasts.

980
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
It's titled Late Entry Episode 255.

981
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
So it's a few episodes back.

982
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Take-Two Interactive had to dish out about 2 million for this hot coffee leak.

983
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:58,000
I'm concerned about the programmer or project manager responsible for the original hot coffee feature.

984
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
What's going to happen to them?

985
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Did they get lynched, raped, or mobbed by corporate?

986
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
I don't know.

987
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
We never really heard about it.

988
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,000
But those type of internal things are company dealings.

989
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
We never know.

990
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:15,000
I imagine there were multiple people responsible for it,

991
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,000
and it was probably part of the original concept as it was.

992
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,000
And if you think way back to when we were first talking about hot coffee,

993
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:26,000
I think the whole problem was is that the mode was never taken out of the game.

994
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Whatever pointed to the mode,

995
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,000
if you think about programming, the way it works every game is like a giant flow chart, right?

996
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
So basically what they did,

997
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:38,000
they took that arrow out that enables something to go to the sex mode and turn it on,

998
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:42,000
and all that cheat did was put that arrow back in, basically.

999
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,000
So I don't think one person was solely responsible for that.

1000
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:50,000
I think that was part of a larger screw-up, basically.

1001
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:56,000
That's why the game took so freaking long to come out in its sanitized version,

1002
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,000
because they had to go back and actually take out the entire thing,

1003
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:04,000
and to be honest, if there's some content that's in the game that they leave in there,

1004
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
people will find it.

1005
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,000
I mean, shit, they found stuff in Zelda, like the debug levels.

1006
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,000
They found stuff in Wind Waker, of course.

1007
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:17,000
They found stuff in pretty much any game that has stuff hidden in there.

1008
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Smash Brothers, hidden characters, stuff like that.

1009
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
We were getting into a talk earlier about,

1010
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
just want to say, before I get back to the email,

1011
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
because now I'm looking at chat room,

1012
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:28,000
and we talked about porn earlier,

1013
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:32,000
and DML wanted to remind us that the porn industry actually supports HD DVD,

1014
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
not Blu-Ray.

1015
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,000
They support both.

1016
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
They support wherever people are going to buy shit.

1017
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Legezaku says Blu-Ray forbids porn, hope you know.

1018
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Hmm.

1019
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
That's bullshit, because I know Pirates,

1020
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:46,000
that porno that's pretty funny, actually, high production value,

1021
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,000
is on both Blu-Ray and HD DVD.

1022
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Oh, snap.

1023
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Let's see, what else did Fergotron say here?

1024
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Sky, you mentioned that you play a lot of WoW instead of other games.

1025
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,000
I'm in the same situation.

1026
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
I have only a limited amount of time to play games,

1027
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
so when it comes time to play,

1028
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
I end up playing whatever game I can get the most out of,

1029
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
which ends up being WoW.

1030
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
What server do you play on, and what's your character's name?

1031
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Mine is, I don't know if he wants me to read this on the air.

1032
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
So there you have it.

1033
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Hey, if you want to find out more information

1034
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:17,000
about the Orange Lounge Guild that we all play on in WoW,

1035
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
it's all on the forums, so check it out.

1036
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Forums.

1037
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Ah, nice plug, huh?

1038
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Go to orangeloungevideo.com and click on Forums.

1039
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
I don't know if my character name's posted,

1040
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,000
but if you join the Guild, it won't be hard to figure out who I am.

1041
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Honestly, if you listen to this show long enough, you'll know.

1042
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:38,000
The last email tonight comes to us from Ali, I believe it's Ali.

1043
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:43,000
I was listening to Episode 255, Part B, and you just mentioned Logo.

1044
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Oh my God, I was a beast at Logo.

1045
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,000
I remember me and my one friend had a working Tetris on Logo.

1046
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
You have no idea how hard that is.

1047
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
However, because the language was highly inefficient,

1048
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
it would go wicked slow.

1049
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
They had this running on a 1 GHz Celeron,

1050
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
it was called MicroWorlds on those machines,

1051
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
and the processor would be maxed out,

1052
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,000
the fan would be going full tilt to play Tetris.

1053
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Yeah, I'm a nerd.

1054
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Other than that, I remember I would make some hardcore art with Logo,

1055
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
fractals and stuff.

1056
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Good times.

1057
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Good times.

1058
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,000
I only ever had Logo on the Commodore 64.

1059
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
And for a reminder for those that weren't listening that week,

1060
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Logo is that language where you have the little turtle

1061
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,000
and you would point, you know, pen down, up 10, right 10,

1062
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
you know, and all that stuff.

1063
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,000
And it was basically how people of a younger age

1064
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
could learn programming more easily.

1065
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Why are you giving me dirty looks, Rice Princess?

1066
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,000
I'm not giving you dirty looks, Rice Princess.

1067
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Not right then.

1068
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
I'm just pooping.

1069
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
That's what it looks like.

1070
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Yeah, mind your own business, Tom.

1071
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
Try not to in the room.

1072
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
All right.

1073
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Mailbag at OrangeLunchrated.com

1074
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
if you want to send us some more email.

1075
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Skyline will be open very soon.

1076
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,000
We have about three more stories for you guys before we get there, though.

1077
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Get your dialing fingers ready.

1078
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
1-877-GAME-OLR.

1079
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Our username on Skype, OrangeLunchRadio,

1080
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
right after a few more news stories.

1081
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000
All right.

1082
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Including one talking about Boom Boom Rocket.

1083
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Of course, we mentioned it in the past about an upcoming update.

1084
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Well, now it's live and there's a little bit of bonus with that.

1085
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Not only will you be able to play with dance mats and guitars,

1086
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:19,000
but you will also be able to play five new songs,

1087
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:24,000
including Cannon and Dee, Sugar High, Sting of the Bumblebee,

1088
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Explode to Joy.

1089
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,000
That's what it sounds like Rice Princess was doing earlier in the corner.

1090
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
It was.

1091
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:38,000
It looks like Ein Klein rock music.

1092
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
I downloaded the five new songs.

1093
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
They're okay.

1094
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
They are more rock influenced than Synthy,

1095
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:46,000
but I wasn't that impressed because they are, again,

1096
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
just classic remix songs.

1097
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
And one other thing I was going to say,

1098
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:54,000
I believe that you can also use the rock band drums for this as well,

1099
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
if you are ever so inclined.

1100
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,000
If you're really bored.

1101
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Yeah, really bored.

1102
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Really bored.

1103
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:06,000
And basically, the five songs are free for right now until December 16th.

1104
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Then afterwards, it's going to set you back 250 Microsoft points.

1105
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:13,000
So if you have a chance, get on live, get the update, get the free songs,

1106
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
play it later.

1107
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Even if you don't think you'll want to play them now,

1108
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
get it anyway while it's still free.

1109
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Exactly.

1110
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Free is always good.

1111
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Free is good.

1112
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Unless it's Yaris, in which case it's not good.

1113
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Free is good.

1114
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Well, I know there is so much love out there for Portal

1115
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
and the Weighted Companion Cube.

1116
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:38,000
And this is a whole how to do it yourself guide

1117
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,000
to making a weighted companion cube paperweight.

1118
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:44,000
It comes from the site demon-alley.com.

1119
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
If you go to demon-alley.com slash WCC,

1120
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:51,000
you get a whole do it yourself guide on how to make a weighted companion cube.

1121
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:55,000
But I think the problem is you still have to be somewhat good at art to make this.

1122
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:59,000
But if you think about it, a lot of the principles you learn here,

1123
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
you could apply to a lot of different crafts.

1124
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
I mean, who's to say you can make a weighted companion cube out of it?

1125
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Is that with clay or is that like styrofoam that they're carving or something?

1126
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:10,000
It says the materials in it are, I quote,

1127
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Sculpey, armature wire, acrylic paints, sandpaper and or steel wool, sculpting tools,

1128
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
and optional, terpenoid.

1129
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Okay, so it's clay. It's Sculpey clay.

1130
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Yeah, Sculpey is clay.

1131
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
So that's what they use.

1132
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,000
And you actually, I guess, make a cube out of it and then carve into it.

1133
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:30,000
And then you bake it and then you color it, basically.

1134
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,000
And then you feed it to your cat or make your cat look at it.

1135
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,000
So, cute.

1136
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
And Sculpey, if I remember correctly,

1137
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,000
because my sister makes a ton of shit out of that stuff.

1138
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
She loves doing that.

1139
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
You can use it. You can fire it in your oven.

1140
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Frisbee says that needs to be my Christmas gift.

1141
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:51,000
That might be actually a fun Christmas gift for people.

1142
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Fun.

1143
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Well, you know.

1144
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Fun-tastic.

1145
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
I don't know about you guys, but I like homemade gifts.

1146
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:02,000
I think they mean a lot more than something bought at Target on clearance.

1147
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Well, then I'll poop in a bag for you.

1148
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
I can make a lot of those.

1149
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
You guys are obscene.

1150
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Enough for all of my friends.

1151
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
No, I know what you mean, Rob.

1152
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
I like homemade stuff.

1153
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Let's make Arcs and Craps together for Christmas gifts.

1154
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,000
No.

1155
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,000
I'm going to get you a coaster for Christmas.

1156
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Don't you want one of those?

1157
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:24,000
I'm going to make candy with the aqua dots in it.

1158
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,000
Like, you know, cookies.

1159
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
What are these special chips?

1160
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Aqua dots.

1161
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Oh, crap.

1162
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,000
I'm tripping.

1163
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Want to make out.

1164
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Date-rape-licious.

1165
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Yeah, that's fun.

1166
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
That's terrible.

1167
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Special Rice Krispie treats.

1168
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Oh, they're special already.

1169
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Anyways.

1170
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:48,200
And then another game, as I mentioned earlier, possibly going to import Wii Fit has come

1171
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:49,200
out in Japan.

1172
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:53,000
And, of course, there are lines for it.

1173
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:56,200
Lots of people looking to play this game, including there's going to be a lot of cool

1174
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:57,200
stuff in there.

1175
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:01,000
There's yoga, which looks pretty cool.

1176
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:07,000
There's balance, including they have a skiing game, soccer, ski jump, some sort of, like,

1177
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:10,000
monkey ball thing, and tight rope.

1178
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:14,000
And then cardio, they have hula hoop, jogging, and dancing.

1179
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Awesome.

1180
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Can't wait for it.

1181
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,000
This game is fucking expensive if you import it.

1182
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,000
It's like $189.

1183
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Oh, my God.

1184
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Oh, Jesus.

1185
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Why so much?

1186
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Is that just because of the shipping and everything?

1187
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Import.

1188
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Because the import fees can't be that high.

1189
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
High demand, so.

1190
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
I still might get it, though.

1191
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Oh, my God.

1192
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,000
You're insane.

1193
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Why can't you just wait a few months for the version to come out here in the U.S.?

1194
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Because I have bonus money to burn, and I can do it that way.

1195
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Give me money.

1196
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
I'll spend it on a good cause.

1197
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,000
I know.

1198
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Oh, you're crazy.

1199
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,000
All right.

1200
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:51,000
We are now going to go to the Skype lines at www.orangelandrado.com.

1201
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Click on interact with us, and you can get all the information on the Skype line.

1202
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Our user name is orangelandrado on Skype.

1203
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,800
Or if that doesn't work for you, all that technical stuff is too much for you, you can

1204
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:03,800
always give us a call on our 800 line, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1205
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:06,300
I believe we have a call right now.

1206
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:08,800
Hello, caller, are you there on Orange Land Radio?

1207
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:10,800
Hello, everyone.

1208
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:11,800
Hi.

1209
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:12,800
Who's this?

1210
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:15,800
It's Rice Princesses on behalf of Rana.

1211
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:18,800
Ah, Rice Princesses, better half, or other BF.

1212
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:19,800
Oh, other boyfriend.

1213
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:20,800
Oh, whoa.

1214
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:21,800
Oh, snap.

1215
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:22,800
Ooh.

1216
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:23,800
Ooh, competition.

1217
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:24,800
All right.

1218
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:25,800
You know she poops a lot, right?

1219
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:26,800
And fart.

1220
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:27,800
Don't forget that.

1221
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:29,800
Rama, what's on your mind?

1222
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:31,800
A couple of things.

1223
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:36,800
The first thing I want to talk about is the whole GameStop charging more money for accessories.

1224
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:42,000
I mean, I've seen them do this on a regular basis because when BeatMania came out, I went

1225
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:47,080
over to Best Buy and they had it for like, I think it was $59, and I went over to GameStop,

1226
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:48,080
they had it for $69.

1227
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:53,640
I mean, normally the games are no price everywhere else, but when it comes to anything with an

1228
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:57,560
accessory, they're known for charging $5 to $10 more for it.

1229
00:58:57,560 --> 00:58:58,840
That's why you got to shop around.

1230
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:01,360
Do they price match there, out of curiosity?

1231
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:03,560
No, because they don't advertise.

1232
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:04,560
That's what it is.

1233
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:05,560
Interesting.

1234
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:06,560
Yeah.

1235
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:09,680
Plus that they do a lot of sales with huge games and stuff they don't price match.

1236
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:12,360
Well, that's why you want to do your research before you go out and buy.

1237
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:17,520
I mean, sometimes GameStop may have the best deal, like Final Fantasy XII had that collector's

1238
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:20,320
edition that was only available at GameStop that had some extra stuff with it.

1239
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:23,400
You know, sometimes it's a good place to get games, but sometimes you're better off going

1240
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:24,400
somewhere else.

1241
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:29,400
Yeah, I did go to GameStop to get my collector's edition, but other than that, there wasn't

1242
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:30,400
going to be one.

1243
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,760
I would have gone to Best Buy.

1244
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:37,840
I remember when Nintendogs first came out, I ended up going to Best Buy.

1245
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:41,920
I was going to go to GameStop, but that day I found out there was a $5 gift card or something

1246
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:45,440
you would get if you bought it at Best Buy.

1247
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:52,560
That's why that website CheapAssGamer, that's why that website is so insanely popular, because

1248
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:55,320
it's like gamers getting together to share their resources about where to find the best

1249
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:56,320
deal.

1250
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:57,320
Seriously.

1251
00:59:57,320 --> 00:59:58,320
Mm-hmm.

1252
00:59:58,320 --> 00:59:59,320
Whoever thought of that, honestly?

1253
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:00,320
Genius idea.

1254
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:01,320
Genius idea.

1255
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:02,320
Wish I'd thought of it.

1256
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:03,320
I'm jealous.

1257
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:04,320
Anything else?

1258
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:10,920
Yeah, I want to talk about this whole controversy of this guy getting fired over his honest

1259
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:14,080
review of Kane & Lynch.

1260
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:18,560
This is going to open up a lawsuit for wrongful termination, because I think it's really fucked

1261
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:21,840
up that someone gets fired for their honest opinion on something, you know?

1262
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:22,840
Mm-hmm.

1263
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:24,800
I mean, is that fair, you know?

1264
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:29,400
But Rama, like I said earlier in the show, we don't know for sure that's the reason yet.

1265
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:33,880
And especially in the state of California, where this guy works, we have this whole law

1266
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:39,440
about the whole at-will employment, where basically an employee can leave an organization

1267
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:43,640
no questions asked, an employer can terminate them, essentially, no questions asked.

1268
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:46,160
It's kind of to avoid those types of situations.

1269
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:51,000
In order for him to claim wrongful termination, it would almost have to be like they were

1270
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:56,720
setting him up in a way, or they were like, you know, trapping him into this or something,

1271
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:57,720
you know?

1272
01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:02,240
Like, I don't know, it'd be kind of, it'd be very hard for them to pull it off.

1273
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:04,040
I don't know if I'd go that far.

1274
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:07,720
I think this guy's going to land a job somewhere else in the industry, even though I had no

1275
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:10,800
idea who he was before this week, he's obviously very well respected.

1276
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:15,200
Hell, if the people at 1UP love him so much, I think it might be kind of, you know, and

1277
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:19,120
they're only a couple blocks away, I think that kind of shows you where he might go,

1278
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:20,120
but who knows?

1279
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:21,120
It works.

1280
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:24,680
At the same time, if you're a talented writer, maybe he'll decide this whole thing hasn't

1281
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:28,800
jaded from the games industry and he's going to go review movies or go write for a newspaper.

1282
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:31,040
It's really up to him.

1283
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:32,040
Pretty much.

1284
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:33,040
I know there are other states that are like that.

1285
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:36,160
I know here in New York, it's not at Will State.

1286
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:41,320
They have to find a reason for you to be fired, unless you're like, during your first 30 or

1287
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:42,320
90 days.

1288
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:47,360
Then they can just like, oh, fired, done, you know, whatever.

1289
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:48,360
Right.

1290
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:53,840
Well, Rama, do you have any other comments or anything else you want to talk about tonight?

1291
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:56,560
Last thing, and then I'll be on My Merry Little Way.

1292
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:59,880
I'm probably one of the few people in the chat room that's really against this whole

1293
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:02,920
Activision Vivendi buyout thing.

1294
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:05,020
I'm just really appalled by it.

1295
01:02:05,020 --> 01:02:07,520
Are you sure you're not being a little tinfoil hat-ish?

1296
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:08,520
No.

1297
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:09,520
I know.

1298
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:11,320
What's so scary about it?

1299
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:17,120
It's not scary, it's just that Activision is like one of the last long-running independent

1300
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:19,040
game publishers going back to the 70s.

1301
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:24,680
They have like this long, decorative career of great things that they've done, and now

1302
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:27,960
boom, they're part of some like multi-global unit.

1303
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:30,520
It's like, look at Atari, for example.

1304
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:37,120
They wanted like a good thing going, and then Infogrames bought them, renamed it to Atari,

1305
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:38,400
and now look at them.

1306
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:41,040
I guess that's true.

1307
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:44,940
I guess maybe this is a little bit of a fear, but you know, mergers aren't necessarily always

1308
01:02:44,940 --> 01:02:45,940
a bad thing.

1309
01:02:45,940 --> 01:02:47,800
Square Enix didn't work out so bad.

1310
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:52,760
I just find the Square Enix merger funny because Square is doing more profits than Enix.

1311
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:57,120
Enix walks up out of nowhere with a big thing of cash, and they're like, hi, we're buying

1312
01:02:57,120 --> 01:02:59,120
you.

1313
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:07,920
The thing is that this is not really like a merger per se, it's just that all Vivendi

1314
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:11,360
has is just like a controlling stake in the company.

1315
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:14,160
They haven't said it's a merger or anything, you know?

1316
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:20,400
All right, well, we'll see if your tinfoil hat things come true or not.

1317
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:21,600
I hope not, though.

1318
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:28,920
I'm not scared yet, but you know, yeah, when we start seeing the whole, you know, the orcs

1319
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:32,840
and torrents showing up in Guitar Hero, then I will be a little scared.

1320
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:33,840
All right.

1321
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:35,440
We'll see what happens, as you said.

1322
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:36,440
All right.

1323
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:37,440
Well, take care, Rama.

1324
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:38,440
We've got to get some more calls.

1325
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:39,440
You got it.

1326
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:40,440
Bye-bye.

1327
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:41,440
Bye, Rama.

1328
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:46,000
7 Game O-L-R is the magic number to call, or you can give us a call on our Skype line.

1329
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,400
Orange Lounge Radio is our username on Skype.

1330
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:50,200
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1331
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:51,200
Who's this?

1332
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:52,200
It's Puppy.

1333
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:53,200
Hello, Puppy.

1334
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:54,200
What's on your mind, Puppy?

1335
01:03:54,200 --> 01:04:03,360
Oh, just a lot of stuff, but mostly just a lot of rock band issues.

1336
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:04,360
What's going on?

1337
01:04:04,360 --> 01:04:05,360
Did your stuff break?

1338
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:13,280
Yeah, my guitar got that bad strum bar problem that's been popping up with a lot of people.

1339
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:15,480
I know you can fix that yourself.

1340
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:22,880
Yeah, but I'm not that handy with electronics, so I'd rather not risk tinkering with it.

1341
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:23,880
Or you're just lazy.

1342
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:24,880
It's not lazy.

1343
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:26,280
It really isn't that hard.

1344
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:30,600
You basically unscrew the back, and what it is is the contact switch in there gets kind

1345
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:35,400
of, I guess, turned, and all you have to do is just loosen the screw, line it back up,

1346
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:37,840
and tighten it again, and then you're good to go.

1347
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:41,400
That doesn't sound too hard when Loki says it.

1348
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:46,400
Well, I've actually got my thumb away already, man.

1349
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:50,480
Oh, your guitar's already set back, because I was going to say, if you want, if Op 11's

1350
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:53,960
back up and running next week and you trust Loki enough, we could take your guitar apart

1351
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:55,360
live on air and fix it.

1352
01:04:55,360 --> 01:04:59,560
Apparently, though, they actually are giving away free games, too, if you have your guitar

1353
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:01,520
fixed, you get a free game winner.

1354
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:05,240
But they haven't said what the game is yet, right?

1355
01:05:05,240 --> 01:05:11,520
I read that story earlier, and I think it said that people that had put their oars in

1356
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:16,720
for replacement like a week ago, and it was getting delayed because of a lack of stock

1357
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:18,880
for them to send out, and they were getting that free game.

1358
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:21,840
Yeah, I think I heard our old buddy Bobby Black Wolf talking about that, because he's

1359
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:26,080
been having problems with not just the drums, but now his guitar as well, and they sent

1360
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:29,920
him an email because his drums got delayed, but then they told him it was the guitar in

1361
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:33,480
the email, so he's just all kinds of confused, and I was listening to that on his show this

1362
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:36,600
week, and it's just kind of unfortunate.

1363
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:40,560
Makes me glad I didn't buy the whole Rock Band bundle, although I've got to say, on

1364
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:44,080
my Guitar Hero 2 controller, I have the Explorer controller, which is pretty much what I'm

1365
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:47,560
using to play Guitar Hero 3 in Rock Band, my yellow button is sticking a little bit,

1366
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:51,240
which is pissing me off, because I don't want to buy a new controller.

1367
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:52,240
But I guess that's what I get for not touching the game.

1368
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:57,240
I ended up using my Guitar Hero 3 controller for my guitar, because my guitar actually

1369
01:05:57,240 --> 01:06:04,560
started acting up only like four or five days after I got the system, and it just got progressively

1370
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:07,520
worse, and now it's to the point where the down strum doesn't work at all.

1371
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:11,440
So the Guitar Hero 3 controller works on Rock Band?

1372
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:15,080
My Guitar Hero 3 controller, my wireless one, does work on my system.

1373
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:18,200
It's only the PlayStation 3 version that does not play nice with each other.

1374
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:19,200
Oh, I thought that worked on...

1375
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:22,560
Okay, maybe I'll get the Guitar Hero 3 controller then, because I do kind of want a wireless

1376
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:23,560
controller.

1377
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:24,560
That'll be fun.

1378
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:25,560
We'll see.

1379
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:26,560
That's a lot of money.

1380
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:31,360
The wireless controller is nice, but I like the design for the Rock Band controller a

1381
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:32,360
lot better.

1382
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:34,760
I love the design on the Rock Band controller.

1383
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:37,380
It's a bummer that they're having all the problems they are.

1384
01:06:37,380 --> 01:06:40,480
Hopefully by the time they start selling them separately next year, they can fix some of

1385
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:41,480
those problems.

1386
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:42,760
I really hope so.

1387
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:47,160
Yeah, that would be nice, because having an extra controller would be good for parties

1388
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:48,560
and whatnot.

1389
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:49,560
It'd be nice.

1390
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:55,040
They didn't get Guitar Hero 3, so I'm sure there's very few of those people out there

1391
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:56,040
at this point.

1392
01:06:56,040 --> 01:07:01,960
All right, well, anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight, Puppy?

1393
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:07,520
Not much, other than the fact that I finished Assassin's Creed and I jumped up and screamed

1394
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:08,520
at the ending.

1395
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:11,600
I heard the ending is kind of shocking a lot of people.

1396
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:12,600
Very interesting.

1397
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:14,600
I'd be very curious about that.

1398
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:18,000
I wouldn't want to go into details and spoil it, but yeah.

1399
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
You don't see it coming.

1400
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,000
Interesting.

1401
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:24,080
Isn't the ending supposedly kind of a trip, too?

1402
01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:30,600
Yeah, the ending itself is really trippy, and the way it's kind of set up is that they

1403
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:34,280
basically knew ahead of time that this was going to be a trilogy.

1404
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:37,000
But the beginning is weird, too, right?

1405
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,360
Oh, yeah.

1406
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:41,360
When I first started, I'm like, okay, what's going on here?

1407
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:46,600
This doesn't look like a game in the Crusades.

1408
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:52,120
It took me a good two or three hours into it before I started to catch the whole timeline

1409
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:53,120
of the game.

1410
01:07:53,120 --> 01:07:54,120
All right.

1411
01:07:54,120 --> 01:07:57,920
Well, Puppy, we've got to let you go to get more calls, but thanks so much for the call,

1412
01:07:57,920 --> 01:07:58,920
all right?

1413
01:07:58,920 --> 01:07:59,920
All right.

1414
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:00,920
Bye-bye.

1415
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:05,360
If you have a call, you want to get through to us, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype.

1416
01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:08,520
Orange Lounge Radio is the username on Skype.

1417
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:11,480
Waiting for a call to drop.

1418
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:13,480
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1419
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:14,480
Who's this?

1420
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:15,480
Good evening, guys.

1421
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:16,680
It's DMN.

1422
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:18,440
Hello, DMN.

1423
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:21,120
What's on your mind, my friend?

1424
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:23,400
First of all, if you haven't bought Mass Effect, buy it.

1425
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:25,720
It's the game of the year.

1426
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:28,640
I'm waiting on pins and needles to check it out.

1427
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:29,640
I'm so excited.

1428
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:32,360
I'm supposed to be borrowing my friend's copy very soon, so we'll see.

1429
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:34,920
I got a free copy from my buddy at Microsoft.

1430
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:38,080
But anyway, that is not what I call.

1431
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:44,080
I have called because I think everybody who listens to this show should thank you, Loki,

1432
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:48,240
Max Dacher, and everybody else who reports news on this station because we don't get

1433
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:51,240
paid to do a damn thing.

1434
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:57,000
The reason I say this is the story that led into the show tonight was Jeff Gertzman getting

1435
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:02,760
fired from GameSpot over his review of Kane & Lynch, which was an acceptable review.

1436
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:08,360
Everybody gave that review at the most a seven across the board.

1437
01:09:08,360 --> 01:09:15,240
The fact that Eidos dropped their advertising, which then I don't know what happened, but

1438
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:22,880
it forced him to get fired, I think that's the most lowest unobjected thing I've ever

1439
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:25,920
seen a media publication do.

1440
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:31,920
But again, do you think you might be filling in some gaps with hearsay, though?

1441
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:36,560
That's the only thing I'm kind of challenging here is that, yes, we know Eidos pulled the

1442
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:41,520
bad campaign, but did they necessarily do it because of the bad review itself?

1443
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:45,000
Did they maybe do it because of all this fallout that happened because of it?

1444
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,360
Well, I mean, not up to then.

1445
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:54,480
I was going on Eidos' forums this morning, and I saw people telling Eidos shame on them

1446
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:58,400
for doing what they did, and those threads were getting locked and deleted, which means

1447
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:04,640
I think Eidos knows a little more than they want to say about the situation.

1448
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:07,440
And I just hate the gaming companies being so intimidating.

1449
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:12,200
If I recall, we had Beautiful Katamari.

1450
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:18,400
We had an exclusive release date, and we were intimidated by Namco to pull that, because

1451
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:21,960
I want to say, what was it, 1UP?

1452
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:26,600
Apparently bought the rights to that, which I think is retarded.

1453
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:29,240
I don't think anybody should ever have to buy news.

1454
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:31,320
I don't think anybody should have to.

1455
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:35,880
Companies should not be involved only when it's purchasing games and or the gaming review

1456
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:36,880
magazines.

1457
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:42,640
I don't think that the companies should be in bed with the gaming review magazines ever.

1458
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:47,680
It's going to create bad situations like this, it's going to blow things wide open, it's

1459
01:10:47,680 --> 01:10:49,400
going to make a lot of these publishers look bad.

1460
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:50,680
Eidos has lost my business.

1461
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:52,840
I was going to buy Conan and I Boring Adventures.

1462
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:55,280
I'm taking my $50 and going elsewhere with that now.

1463
01:10:55,280 --> 01:11:01,840
As we referenced earlier in the show, and you do definitely bring up a source subject

1464
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:07,440
around these parts, but it's a fair comparison, so fine.

1465
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:11,800
It just goes to show you that there's a lot of shady things that go on behind the scenes,

1466
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:17,520
and that's why a lot of this corporate stuff has a very sour taste in my mouth a lot of

1467
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:19,160
the times.

1468
01:11:19,160 --> 01:11:26,120
If anything, I'm very interested to see whether it be mob mentality or not, there's going

1469
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:31,800
to be a lot of people that are going to open themselves up to getting the news from gamers

1470
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:34,160
who aren't necessarily paid to do it.

1471
01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:38,320
I'm very interested to see where that takes us, the independent folks.

1472
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:44,020
I would honestly say if this were to happen to Orange Lounge Radio, the same situation

1473
01:11:44,020 --> 01:11:49,200
with an editor, I think a lot of the listeners here would go away.

1474
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:54,280
I think it would look bad on Orange Lounge Radio, and that's why I'm glad we're independent.

1475
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:58,280
That's why I'm glad we're not too coerced by money.

1476
01:11:58,280 --> 01:12:01,960
Crouere-We're the type of people that would have come on air and said, can you believe

1477
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:05,420
Eidos wants us to pull the ad campaign over this review?

1478
01:12:05,420 --> 01:12:07,720
We kicked them to the curb.

1479
01:12:07,720 --> 01:12:12,760
I guess that's just the difference, but we don't pretend to be a money-making corporation

1480
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:13,760
either.

1481
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:14,760
We're not making money.

1482
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:15,760
That's kind of the sad thing.

1483
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:16,760
We're making tons of money.

1484
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:17,760
You just don't know about it.

1485
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:18,760
Really?

1486
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:19,760
Where's my cut?

1487
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:24,760
I blow all of it on crack.

1488
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:28,280
DMN, anything else you want to share with the listeners?

1489
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:31,600
We've got to get some more calls, though.

1490
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:33,240
It's raining like hell in Seattle.

1491
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:34,240
Have a good night.

1492
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:35,240
All right.

1493
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:37,240
Thank you for the weather report, DMN.

1494
01:12:37,240 --> 01:12:38,240
I appreciate it.

1495
01:12:38,240 --> 01:12:41,880
I'm going to log you out.

1496
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:44,840
That was an even better report than the forecast channel, to be honest.

1497
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:45,840
We've got more calls.

1498
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:46,840
We're ringing off the hook tonight.

1499
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:48,080
Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio.

1500
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:49,080
Who's this?

1501
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:50,080
Raven's Dolphin.

1502
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:51,080
How are you tonight, Sky?

1503
01:12:51,080 --> 01:12:52,080
Hello.

1504
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:53,080
I'm okay.

1505
01:12:53,080 --> 01:12:54,760
How are you, Raven's Dolphin?

1506
01:12:54,760 --> 01:12:55,760
I'm okay.

1507
01:12:55,760 --> 01:13:00,000
I just want to shed some more light on the Gershman trial, or not Gershman trial, the

1508
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,000
Gershman thing.

1509
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:02,000
Yes.

1510
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,000
Not a trial yet.

1511
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,000
Who knows?

1512
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,000
Jumping the gun.

1513
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:06,000
See?

1514
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Hold on a minute, Raven's Dolphin.

1515
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,000
See?

1516
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,280
This is exactly what happens when you play the Internet game of telephone.

1517
01:13:10,280 --> 01:13:14,040
Now suddenly on a blog, it's going to show up, oh my God, the Gershman firing case goes

1518
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:15,040
to trial.

1519
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:16,160
I heard it on OLR.

1520
01:13:16,160 --> 01:13:17,480
It's true.

1521
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:18,480
It's not true.

1522
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:19,480
It's not true.

1523
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:20,480
I'm right.

1524
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:21,480
No one will believe that.

1525
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:22,480
I forgot.

1526
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:23,480
That's right.

1527
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:27,300
No one believes the poo that falls out of our mouths every Sunday night on this program,

1528
01:13:27,300 --> 01:13:30,200
if the corporate sites are to be deplete.

1529
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:33,280
Anyway, what's on your mind, Raven's Dolphin?

1530
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:34,520
I'm going to shed some light.

1531
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:37,000
So basically, I did some investigation work.

1532
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:41,520
So I usually listen to their podcast, I'm going to withhold their name, and he wasn't

1533
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:42,520
on it.

1534
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:43,520
He's always on it.

1535
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:44,520
He wasn't on it.

1536
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:49,840
So I'm believing that he got fired before the podcast went live.

1537
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:50,840
And that's pretty shady.

1538
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:53,180
And they didn't even mention he went on vacation or anything.

1539
01:13:53,180 --> 01:13:55,020
They just said nothing.

1540
01:13:55,020 --> 01:13:56,840
So that's pretty shady right there.

1541
01:13:56,840 --> 01:13:59,040
When does that particular show come out?

1542
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:00,160
Wednesday.

1543
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:03,300
That's the day supposedly he was canned.

1544
01:14:03,300 --> 01:14:04,400
Let's use the word allegedly.

1545
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:05,400
That makes us sound professional.

1546
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:06,400
But they recorded it.

1547
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:10,200
Apparently, Wednesday was the day he was locked out of the office and his boxes were thrown

1548
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:12,960
out on the curb.

1549
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:13,960
That just sounds wrong.

1550
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:18,120
Even, you know, it's going to feel like, I'm going to feel dumb if this happens when he

1551
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:23,040
goes like, well, it wasn't over Kane and Lynch or he had some girl in the background fondling

1552
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:24,320
in the GameSpot office.

1553
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:25,320
I'm going to feel bad.

1554
01:14:25,320 --> 01:14:28,360
Now, see, that would be awesome if that was...

1555
01:14:28,360 --> 01:14:30,240
The man gets a raise.

1556
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:33,120
That's the kind of teamwork I like to see here.

1557
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:38,080
This guy was having an illicit affair with somebody else in the office and poor Idus

1558
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:42,240
gets thrown under the bus over this whole thing.

1559
01:14:42,240 --> 01:14:47,840
I mean, the gaming community would owe these guys one hell of an apology if that came to

1560
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:48,840
light.

1561
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:49,840
Never going to happen.

1562
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:50,840
Yeah, I know.

1563
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:52,200
It's just funny to imagine these things.

1564
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:53,200
I don't know.

1565
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:54,200
I live in a weird world.

1566
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:56,200
Anyway, sorry, Raven's Dolphin.

1567
01:14:56,200 --> 01:15:01,240
I usually follow GameSpot for years and this guy, I trust the guy, you know, he gives a

1568
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:05,440
pretty good review and just seeing him on the curve and, you know, and a lot of people

1569
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:08,180
are boycotting the network now.

1570
01:15:08,180 --> 01:15:13,880
They're canceling their descriptions to GameSpot and I kind of support that.

1571
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:21,400
DMN wants to know, did the podcasters over on GameSpot sound morose?

1572
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:23,560
They just went on with their normal lives.

1573
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:25,980
They just went like, well, they didn't say anything.

1574
01:15:25,980 --> 01:15:32,160
They just went like, we were going on with our podcast and it just felt so weird.

1575
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:35,840
Felt like they were hiding something and they were.

1576
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:38,800
Maybe dark soccer really isn't in Alabama, Raven's Dolphin.

1577
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:41,400
Was she a lawyer?

1578
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:42,400
No, she is.

1579
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:43,400
Of course she is.

1580
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:44,400
Come on.

1581
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:45,400
We would never do that.

1582
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:46,840
But yeah, it's just funny.

1583
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:48,560
Being buried in Alabama.

1584
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:49,560
Never.

1585
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:54,280
I'm surprised she hasn't called in, but she's probably sleeping if she flew back tonight.

1586
01:15:54,280 --> 01:16:00,440
But anyway, yeah, it's a lot of answers to come next week.

1587
01:16:00,440 --> 01:16:04,360
I think this is going to be one of the hot coffees of 2007.

1588
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:08,480
I think we're going to see this pop up again before we know it.

1589
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:12,680
I can tell you this, as a person that likes GameSpot and I'm the person that I always

1590
01:16:12,680 --> 01:16:14,200
go to GameSpot for my things.

1591
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:20,160
I always reference to them and this is kind of just, I just can't just go there anymore

1592
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:22,240
and trust them anymore.

1593
01:16:22,240 --> 01:16:23,240
I respect them.

1594
01:16:23,240 --> 01:16:28,760
I respect Jeff for giving an honest review of the game, even though that it got pulled.

1595
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:33,980
We don't know until Tuesday, so I respect him for that and I hope he gets a better job.

1596
01:16:33,980 --> 01:16:41,160
You know, I got to say, GameSpot was one of my more, if I was going to go look at corp

1597
01:16:41,160 --> 01:16:46,520
sites, it was probably one of the ones I thought was better written.

1598
01:16:46,520 --> 01:16:48,640
It had a pretty good written.

1599
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:51,360
It was very professional in a lot of the stuff I read.

1600
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:55,840
Some of the corp sites feel a little unprofessional to me, but that particular one felt professional

1601
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:57,680
in some of the things.

1602
01:16:57,680 --> 01:17:01,160
Obviously, when we were in the news a lot, because of the beautiful Katamari and the

1603
01:17:01,160 --> 01:17:05,040
Konami thing, we saw what some of these sites were writing about us and I thought GameSpot

1604
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:06,040
was probably the most fair.

1605
01:17:06,040 --> 01:17:07,040
There they were.

1606
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:12,520
They put it in the rumor control instead of the other, like, they mentioned your name.

1607
01:17:12,520 --> 01:17:13,520
That's the thing.

1608
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:14,520
Interesting.

1609
01:17:14,520 --> 01:17:15,520
Interesting.

1610
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:16,520
All right.

1611
01:17:16,520 --> 01:17:17,760
Well, Ravenstaufen, any other quick thoughts?

1612
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:19,440
I'm echoing, so we've got to let you go here.

1613
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:20,440
Oh, I'm sorry.

1614
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:21,440
Bye-bye.

1615
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:22,440
All right.

1616
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:27,200
If you want to give us a call, we'll take a couple more calls, 877-GAME-OLR, username

1617
01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:28,520
on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.

1618
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:29,520
Hello.

1619
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:30,520
You're on Orange Launch Radio.

1620
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:31,520
Who's this?

1621
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:32,520
Hey, guys.

1622
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:33,520
What's up?

1623
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:34,520
This is Footy Monster.

1624
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:35,520
Hello, Footy Monster.

1625
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:36,520
What's up?

1626
01:17:36,520 --> 01:17:37,520
Hi, Footy Monster.

1627
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:38,520
Nothing much.

1628
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:39,520
Special hello from Rice Princess over there.

1629
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:40,520
I haven't talked to you in a while.

1630
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:41,520
Geez.

1631
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:42,520
All right.

1632
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:43,520
What's up?

1633
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:44,520
I like your avatar on Skype, by the way.

1634
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:47,840
It's some girl with big boobies.

1635
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:49,800
Of course, boobs are the win.

1636
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:53,840
I think this is going to star in Rice Princess' upcoming game, Boobies and Pandas.

1637
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:54,840
All right.

1638
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:56,840
What's in your mind, Footy?

1639
01:17:56,840 --> 01:18:04,520
Well, of course, it has to be this whole thing with GameSpot, and here's two things.

1640
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:09,920
First off, when people are actually looking for reviews, they don't go to one place alone.

1641
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:13,880
They go to all of the places, and they make an evaluation and a general consensus of what

1642
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:18,200
they think they want to think of the game after they read all the reviews, not just

1643
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:19,200
one review.

1644
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:20,200
That's the first thing.

1645
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:21,200
That's the second thing.

1646
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:22,200
Are you sure?

1647
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:23,200
No.

1648
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:24,200
Are you sure?

1649
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:27,080
Because some of those people who are paying for that site and stuff, I don't know.

1650
01:18:27,080 --> 01:18:28,080
Okay.

1651
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:29,640
Here's what you guys need to do if you're looking at reviews.

1652
01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:31,240
If you're going to spend 60 bucks, if you're going to spend 60 bucks...

1653
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:34,920
Don't just look at the numbers that they give the game.

1654
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:39,120
Just look at the pros and cons that they list.

1655
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:40,120
That's another thing.

1656
01:18:40,120 --> 01:18:41,120
That's another thing.

1657
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:44,960
People also, that's my second reason, it's like they were pissed, and whatever happened

1658
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:49,040
happened because of the number and not because of what was written, because I'm sure that

1659
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:53,920
what he wrote is the same thing that everybody else wrote.

1660
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:58,160
The problem with that is that they were an advertiser, but also the number didn't fit

1661
01:18:58,160 --> 01:19:03,440
with the PR department, which is usually the problem with everything in this gaming industry

1662
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:06,440
that we're in.

1663
01:19:06,440 --> 01:19:10,960
We're making this sound like, whatever, this is a huge deal, but in truth, it happens

1664
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:11,960
every day.

1665
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:19,720
It also happens that this guy thought to do it this way, just for, I don't know, it

1666
01:19:19,720 --> 01:19:23,640
just happened this way, and this is the guy that fell down this line.

1667
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:28,360
It's like they tried to make an example out of him.

1668
01:19:28,360 --> 01:19:29,880
I don't know.

1669
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:32,880
I think there's so much more to come on this in the upcoming weeks.

1670
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:35,680
I feel like some of the gaps eventually will have to be filled in.

1671
01:19:35,680 --> 01:19:37,360
This guy's going to talk at some point.

1672
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:41,880
It'll be very interesting to see what he has to say.

1673
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:49,320
Actually, someone did comment on the joystick story that they wrote on this thing, and apparently

1674
01:19:49,320 --> 01:19:55,320
someone from inside GameSpot, and the guys actually said how the process went, and apparently

1675
01:19:55,320 --> 01:19:59,280
the management in GameSpot changed, and now it's just a bunch of suits, and apparently

1676
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:01,880
this kind of thing is going to keep happening in GameSpot.

1677
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:06,360
Well, I don't know, but after this huge backlash, money rules everything, and if it's

1678
01:20:06,360 --> 01:20:10,800
true that people are canceling their accounts not just by the hundreds, but by the thousands,

1679
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:15,140
then there are a board of directors that are over those suits, and those suits will be

1680
01:20:15,140 --> 01:20:19,000
out very soon.

1681
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:20,000
Are you sure about that?

1682
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,520
I mean, the thing is that suits are there for a reason.

1683
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:23,520
That's the reason why they bring them in.

1684
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:25,560
Money changes everything.

1685
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:26,740
Remember that old song?

1686
01:20:26,740 --> 01:20:29,760
If it's true that people are canceling their accounts, and this is their...

1687
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:32,720
I mean, if it's like five people...

1688
01:20:32,720 --> 01:20:36,440
Sometimes a lot of people threaten to do things, but they don't actually do it, but if it's

1689
01:20:36,440 --> 01:20:41,880
true that people are canceling their accounts en masse, that money goes to pay these people's

1690
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:48,400
paychecks, and management will be the first thing to go if this company starts losing

1691
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:49,400
money and they have to lay off.

1692
01:20:49,400 --> 01:20:51,000
I don't want to see GameSpot go under.

1693
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:55,400
I don't, but already they lost credibility, and not the editors.

1694
01:20:55,400 --> 01:20:58,460
I mean, the editors themselves, if they go somewhere else, they're going to have their

1695
01:20:58,460 --> 01:21:03,960
credibility back, but if they go, if they stay there like scaredy cats, and you will

1696
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:08,360
never know if their writing is their honest opinion or something that they're doing just

1697
01:21:08,360 --> 01:21:09,360
because they don't want to lose their jobs.

1698
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:11,400
Well, I was going to say, they may not have a choice.

1699
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:13,360
They may have families and stuff.

1700
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:15,600
The job market's not that easy sometimes.

1701
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:20,920
Oh, I mean, trust me, I understand that, but the thing is we as gamers and as consumers

1702
01:21:20,920 --> 01:21:23,000
who are about to spend whatever our money...

1703
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:27,420
Okay, not me because I hired everything, but people who actually pay for stuff, they want

1704
01:21:27,420 --> 01:21:32,040
to know what they're paying for, so it's not fair for them to buy crap because you don't

1705
01:21:32,040 --> 01:21:37,520
know if they're lying to you when they're supposed to be telling you the objective truth.

1706
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:40,960
For some reason, there's a reason why it's journalism.

1707
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:47,820
It's a niche, but it's journalism, a kind of journalism, so they're supposed to be objective,

1708
01:21:47,820 --> 01:21:54,240
and if money's in the way, I forgot who was it called that said that, but if money's in

1709
01:21:54,240 --> 01:21:56,000
the way, then forget it.

1710
01:21:56,000 --> 01:22:00,400
The whole thing gets screwed, and what we're looking at is everything's going to be game

1711
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:05,000
of the year material because we never know who's going to be paying for the paycheck

1712
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:08,480
at the end of the month.

1713
01:22:08,480 --> 01:22:11,120
One more thing, then we've got to wrap up and let you go.

1714
01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:16,440
I'm looking here at Dr. 3ev, or whatever this guy's name is in chat.

1715
01:22:16,440 --> 01:22:17,440
I can't pronounce his name.

1716
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:18,440
I'm sorry.

1717
01:22:18,440 --> 01:22:23,400
It says, �Footy Monster takes payola for RPG reviews.� Are these accusations true?

1718
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:24,800
I wish they were.

1719
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:30,360
Trust me, the minute it happens, I'm buying myself out the receipt.

1720
01:22:30,360 --> 01:22:31,680
I'm 60.

1721
01:22:31,680 --> 01:22:33,160
Just know it.

1722
01:22:33,160 --> 01:22:34,160
So far, no.

1723
01:22:34,160 --> 01:22:37,200
About that, guys, you need to check out The Witcher.

1724
01:22:37,200 --> 01:22:38,200
Such a good game.

1725
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:39,200
I'll tell you.

1726
01:22:39,200 --> 01:22:40,200
What system is this on?

1727
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:41,200
PC only.

1728
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:42,200
What's PC?

1729
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:43,200
What?

1730
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:44,200
It's PC only?

1731
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:45,200
It's PC only.

1732
01:22:45,200 --> 01:22:46,680
Yeah, but I don't have a great setup.

1733
01:22:46,680 --> 01:22:51,220
I have a really crappy video card, like 60-buck video card, and it works acceptably good in

1734
01:22:51,220 --> 01:22:53,880
medium detail, but it's such a fun game.

1735
01:22:53,880 --> 01:22:55,880
I mean, obligatory plug.

1736
01:22:55,880 --> 01:22:57,960
Check for the review on The Ultimate Quest.

1737
01:22:57,960 --> 01:22:58,960
What's it called?

1738
01:22:58,960 --> 01:22:59,960
The Witcher?

1739
01:22:59,960 --> 01:23:00,960
Yeah.

1740
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:01,960
The Witcher.

1741
01:23:01,960 --> 01:23:04,960
It's based on some Polish guy's books, and it's actually pretty good.

1742
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:05,960
You've heard of this, Loki?

1743
01:23:05,960 --> 01:23:06,960
Yeah.

1744
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:07,960
It sounds like a scary game.

1745
01:23:07,960 --> 01:23:08,960
I guess.

1746
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:09,960
Interesting.

1747
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:10,960
All right.

1748
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:11,960
I'll check it out, Footy.

1749
01:23:11,960 --> 01:23:14,520
It's not a scary game at all, but it has sex, which is good.

1750
01:23:14,520 --> 01:23:15,520
All right.

1751
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:16,520
Sex is great.

1752
01:23:16,520 --> 01:23:17,520
I'm there.

1753
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:18,520
All right, Footy.

1754
01:23:18,520 --> 01:23:19,520
We've got to let you go.

1755
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:20,520
Take care, buddy.

1756
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:21,520
All right.

1757
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:22,520
Take care, guys.

1758
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:23,520
Bye-bye.

1759
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:24,520
You too.

1760
01:23:24,520 --> 01:23:25,520
Bye, Footy.

1761
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:26,520
Bye.

1762
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:28,280
I think this is going to do it for calls tonight, because we're looking at two long segments

1763
01:23:28,280 --> 01:23:29,280
tonight.

1764
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:34,600
The short show last week has made this show very large this week, so we've got to go around

1765
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:38,440
and start getting everybody's final thoughts, but not before we get some last-minute stories.

1766
01:23:38,440 --> 01:23:43,160
Loki, do you have any last-minute stories for us tonight, by chance?

1767
01:23:43,160 --> 01:23:44,160
No.

1768
01:23:44,160 --> 01:23:45,160
Wow.

1769
01:23:45,160 --> 01:23:46,160
That's a first.

1770
01:23:46,160 --> 01:23:47,160
It's a slow week.

1771
01:23:47,160 --> 01:23:48,160
Yeah.

1772
01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:52,160
Well, I mean, there's been a couple huge bombshells, like, of course, the GameSpot thing and everything

1773
01:23:52,160 --> 01:23:56,160
and the Activision, if anything, but then, yeah, the rest of it's been kind of a quiet

1774
01:23:56,160 --> 01:23:57,160
week.

1775
01:23:57,160 --> 01:23:58,160
Oh.

1776
01:23:58,160 --> 01:23:59,160
We'll be back for February.

1777
01:23:59,160 --> 01:24:00,160
Oh.

1778
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:01,160
Really?

1779
01:24:01,160 --> 01:24:08,520
PlayStation 3, 360 Wii, PlayStation 2, maybe, Karaoke Revolution, so.

1780
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:09,520
Mmm.

1781
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:10,520
Interesting.

1782
01:24:10,520 --> 01:24:13,040
That's going to be very interesting, considering harmonics and Konami aren't in bed together

1783
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:14,040
anymore, are they?

1784
01:24:14,040 --> 01:24:15,800
I don't know.

1785
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:16,800
I would like...

1786
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:17,800
They could still make it, though, without them.

1787
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:20,000
I would like to see American Idol on the 360, though.

1788
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:23,160
That would be kind of fun, because I like the Karaoke Revolution series.

1789
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:24,160
Yeah.

1790
01:24:24,160 --> 01:24:25,160
Very cool.

1791
01:24:25,160 --> 01:24:26,160
I hope Universe 2 doesn't suck.

1792
01:24:26,160 --> 01:24:27,160
I hope not either.

1793
01:24:27,160 --> 01:24:28,160
I hope not either.

1794
01:24:28,160 --> 01:24:29,160
We'll see.

1795
01:24:29,160 --> 01:24:30,160
Yeah.

1796
01:24:30,160 --> 01:24:34,280
Uh, Rice Princess, any last-minute stories from you?

1797
01:24:34,280 --> 01:24:35,920
Have you been keeping tabs on the game industry?

1798
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:36,920
I just pooped.

1799
01:24:36,920 --> 01:24:37,920
Yeah, great.

1800
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:38,920
That's great.

1801
01:24:38,920 --> 01:24:39,920
Thank you very much.

1802
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:40,920
You're welcome.

1803
01:24:40,920 --> 01:24:41,920
All right.

1804
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:42,920
Oh, yeah.

1805
01:24:42,920 --> 01:24:43,920
Disney Channel.

1806
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:44,920
Next.

1807
01:24:44,920 --> 01:24:45,920
When's that coming out?

1808
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:46,920
January.

1809
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:47,920
Oh.

1810
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:48,920
All right.

1811
01:24:48,920 --> 01:24:49,920
If at all.

1812
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:50,920
It keeps getting delayed.

1813
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:51,920
All right.

1814
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:53,280
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

1815
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:56,320
Rice Princess, thanks so much for being here tonight, even if you didn't contribute much

1816
01:24:56,320 --> 01:24:57,320
besides your poop jokes.

1817
01:24:57,320 --> 01:24:58,660
No, I'm just kidding.

1818
01:24:58,660 --> 01:25:00,560
We always appreciate having you here.

1819
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:01,560
Thank you.

1820
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:02,560
You're welcome.

1821
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:04,560
Any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

1822
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:05,560
No.

1823
01:25:05,560 --> 01:25:06,560
Okay.

1824
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:07,560
No.

1825
01:25:07,560 --> 01:25:09,040
You contribute so much to this program.

1826
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:10,040
I appreciate it.

1827
01:25:10,040 --> 01:25:11,040
Thanks.

1828
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:13,200
Loki, any final thoughts from you?

1829
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:14,920
I just have a lot of games to play this week.

1830
01:25:14,920 --> 01:25:17,800
Probably won't get to most of them.

1831
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:23,680
My final thought is I need to charge my iPod so I can listen to lots of podcasts tomorrow

1832
01:25:23,680 --> 01:25:27,680
at work because I'm writing tomorrow so I want to be able to listen to podcasts and

1833
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:28,680
music.

1834
01:25:28,680 --> 01:25:29,680
Good idea.

1835
01:25:29,680 --> 01:25:31,240
That sounds good to me.

1836
01:25:31,240 --> 01:25:32,240
All right.

1837
01:25:32,240 --> 01:25:35,240
I need a new job.

1838
01:25:35,240 --> 01:25:37,440
I hope your employers don't listen to this program.

1839
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:38,440
They do.

1840
01:25:38,440 --> 01:25:39,440
Whatever.

1841
01:25:39,440 --> 01:25:42,960
I don't think my manager knows how to operate a podcast anyways, to be honest.

1842
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:45,880
I know I have coworkers who listen to this show sometimes.

1843
01:25:45,880 --> 01:25:46,880
They like it.

1844
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:49,920
No, but seriously though, I mean, I need a new job.

1845
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:51,280
This doesn't pay enough.

1846
01:25:51,280 --> 01:25:54,880
The problem is though in the area that we're at, like since we don't live in the Bay Area,

1847
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:57,200
you know, there's not like game companies all over Sacramento.

1848
01:25:57,200 --> 01:25:59,400
The Bay Area is a highly competitive job market too.

1849
01:25:59,400 --> 01:26:00,400
Yeah.

1850
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:02,120
Hey, I hear there's a couple job openings at GameSpot.

1851
01:26:02,120 --> 01:26:05,400
That's in the Bay Area though, see?

1852
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:06,400
I don't want to be an editor.

1853
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:07,400
You could take the train over there.

1854
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:08,400
I can't write.

1855
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:09,720
You could take the train.

1856
01:26:09,720 --> 01:26:10,720
I can hardly see.

1857
01:26:10,720 --> 01:26:12,920
Can you imagine Loki's game reviews on GameSpot?

1858
01:26:12,920 --> 01:26:14,960
Oh my God, this game sucks.

1859
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:16,160
There wasn't enough boobs.

1860
01:26:16,160 --> 01:26:17,160
No.

1861
01:26:17,160 --> 01:26:23,440
I would be objective, but you know, I just honestly, when we're talking about games during

1862
01:26:23,440 --> 01:26:27,560
our game of the week and stuff like that, I can't go into an in-depth review about stuff

1863
01:26:27,560 --> 01:26:33,800
because honestly, I don't play a lot of stuff and I don't have the free time to like review

1864
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:35,400
a game every week or something like that.

1865
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:37,960
I don't have enough time to play anything.

1866
01:26:37,960 --> 01:26:40,080
You barely have enough time to do this damn show.

1867
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:41,080
I do.

1868
01:26:41,080 --> 01:26:46,200
I barely have enough time to do this damn show, but no, I don't know.

1869
01:26:46,200 --> 01:26:52,080
I would love to do a review show and one of the things I'm planning on doing with my money

1870
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:59,080
they get for my bonus is building a new computer and going to have a nice new video card that's

1871
01:26:59,080 --> 01:27:03,440
going to hopefully have something that I can import component video to so I can do stuff

1872
01:27:03,440 --> 01:27:05,280
like that, video editing and stuff.

1873
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:06,280
Nice.

1874
01:27:06,280 --> 01:27:10,600
I just have to have the time to do all that stuff too because, you know.

1875
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:11,600
Alright.

1876
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:17,200
Well, anyhow, I guess we'll see what the future holds in 2008 for Loki and, you know, all

1877
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:19,080
the rest of us here at Orange Launch Radio.

1878
01:27:19,080 --> 01:27:23,320
Meantime, thank you guys so much for downloading and supporting independent podcasting by listening

1879
01:27:23,320 --> 01:27:24,320
to Orange Launch Radio.

1880
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:25,320
We really appreciate it.

1881
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:29,220
If you like what you heard, please tell two friends about our station because then when

1882
01:27:29,220 --> 01:27:34,440
everybody tells two people, slowly we take over the world and if you don't have any friends,

1883
01:27:34,440 --> 01:27:38,680
I'm sorry to hear that first of all, you can make some friends on our forums at orangelaunchradio.com,

1884
01:27:38,680 --> 01:27:41,800
but you can also leave us a review on iTunes.

1885
01:27:41,800 --> 01:27:45,040
That would be fair as well because we need some more five star reviews on iTunes.

1886
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:46,600
We haven't gotten any in a while.

1887
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:47,600
It kind of makes me sad.

1888
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:48,600
Aww.

1889
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:49,600
Yeah.

1890
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:50,600
Make me happy.

1891
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:51,600
Leave some more five star reviews this week.

1892
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:52,600
That's it guys.

1893
01:27:52,600 --> 01:27:53,600
Thank you so much for tuning in.

1894
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:54,600
Have a great week.

1895
01:27:54,600 --> 01:27:55,600
