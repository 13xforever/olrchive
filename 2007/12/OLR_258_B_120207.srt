00:00:00,487 --> 00:00:05,568
[SPEAKER_07]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.

00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:19,131
[SPEAKER_07]: Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:19,731 --> 00:00:21,471
[SPEAKER_10]: And welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:21,491 --> 00:00:24,212
[SPEAKER_10]: We are live on this Sunday evening, December 2nd of 2007.

6
00:00:24,312 --> 00:00:25,192
[SPEAKER_10]: The year's almost up.

7
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:28,176
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

8
00:00:54,858 --> 00:00:56,959
[SPEAKER_09]: DivX Support, and Xvid Support.

9
00:00:57,139 --> 00:01:01,903
[SPEAKER_09]: So now we can play all the porn that we downloaded on our computers on our 360.

10
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:03,103
[SPEAKER_09]: Hell yeah.

11
00:01:03,644 --> 00:01:07,506
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, of course, the Xbox Live Arcade hits.

12
00:01:08,087 --> 00:01:15,391
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are going to be reduced price games that basically have been released before, sold lots of copies, and now you can buy them cheaper.

13
00:01:16,572 --> 00:01:22,056
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe some of those Bankshot Billiards 2 is going to be like 800 points.

14
00:01:23,516 --> 00:01:24,237
[SPEAKER_09]: Luminous Live

15
00:01:24,744 --> 00:01:26,725
[SPEAKER_09]: The Marketplace is getting a whole facelift.

16
00:01:47,154 --> 00:01:49,415
[SPEAKER_09]: They're going to have things sorted completely differently.

17
00:01:49,815 --> 00:01:53,176
[SPEAKER_10]: In fact, they're going to also have... Are they going to make heads or tails of the movies on there?

18
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:56,737
[SPEAKER_10]: Because trying to find movies right now is not easy.

19
00:01:56,777 --> 00:02:03,218
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know about the movie stuff, but they're going to have this kind of thing where you can... I guess people are kind of calling it a cross-media bar.

20
00:02:03,939 --> 00:02:09,060
[SPEAKER_09]: It's ways of sorting the live marketplace stuff.

21
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,301
[SPEAKER_09]: They have a whole section for free shit, so that's kind of cool.

22
00:02:13,656 --> 00:02:17,059
[SPEAKER_09]: Other things, Xbox Live Originals, of course, is coming up there.

23
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:20,822
[SPEAKER_09]: The Parental Timer as well, Friends of Friends.

24
00:02:21,722 --> 00:02:24,264
[SPEAKER_10]: By the way, the Parental Timer made the front page of Yahoo today.

25
00:02:24,284 --> 00:02:25,225
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if you saw that.

26
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:27,046
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if you visit Yahoo, but it's like my homepage.

27
00:02:27,567 --> 00:02:37,054
[SPEAKER_10]: So it comes up and, yeah, it was mentioning that, oh, the new Xbox will limit how much your kids can play games.

28
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:38,095
[SPEAKER_10]: Kind of interesting.

29
00:02:38,115 --> 00:02:38,515
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

30
00:02:39,434 --> 00:02:47,660
[SPEAKER_09]: The Friends of Friends functionality where you can actually say, for example, Rob, I have a lot of people that are probably on your friends list that I don't have friended to mine.

31
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:53,103
[SPEAKER_09]: If you have that enabled, I can look at your friends list, see who's on, and add people off that.

32
00:02:53,303 --> 00:03:02,349
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, there's going to be a section where you can add a bio to your user tag where you can actually have a thousand words or whatever in there.

33
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:08,583
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, there's also going to be a section where you put your real name and where you're located and stuff if you want to do that.

34
00:03:08,603 --> 00:03:09,844
[SPEAKER_10]: If I want people to know that about me.

35
00:03:10,344 --> 00:03:12,065
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, if you want people to know that about you.

36
00:03:12,645 --> 00:03:14,947
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, what else do they have in there?

37
00:03:15,247 --> 00:03:19,390
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to say I set that functionality to friends only earlier this week when the email went out.

38
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:21,071
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, it's just a little weird.

39
00:03:22,432 --> 00:03:25,714
[SPEAKER_12]: So, when are they going to let you... They're trying to turn the Xbox into MySpace.

40
00:03:25,754 --> 00:03:27,235
[SPEAKER_12]: That's exactly what I was going to say.

41
00:03:27,475 --> 00:03:28,856
[SPEAKER_10]: In a way, well, I mean, it's smart.

42
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:31,858
[SPEAKER_10]: They're capitalizing on that whole social networking phenomenon, but...

43
00:03:33,854 --> 00:03:35,275
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not my space.

44
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:37,076
[SPEAKER_10]: It's really not.

45
00:03:37,096 --> 00:03:44,500
[SPEAKER_10]: Can I remake my profile to look god-awfully ugly in little flash graphics and web bling and glitter graphics?

46
00:03:45,581 --> 00:03:49,223
[SPEAKER_12]: I have a completely... Oh man, we should have brought that up during the break.

47
00:03:49,403 --> 00:03:49,863
[SPEAKER_12]: Never mind.

48
00:03:50,043 --> 00:03:51,324
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll bring it up maybe in Afterbirth.

49
00:03:52,025 --> 00:03:59,869
[SPEAKER_09]: Other things that they're changing too, they're going to add a new Xbox Live Blade where it's going to have RSS feeds.

50
00:04:00,669 --> 00:04:08,075
[SPEAKER_09]: including stuff from Major Nelson and other tidbits of information and or advertisements.

51
00:04:11,178 --> 00:04:11,899
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

52
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,682
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I think that's pretty much it.

53
00:04:16,102 --> 00:04:19,605
[SPEAKER_09]: And, of course, this is all going to be available Tuesday.

54
00:04:21,207 --> 00:04:21,447
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.

55
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:27,172
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, Frisbee says in chat room, chat.orange.com, thanks for the ad.

56
00:04:28,925 --> 00:04:29,545
[SPEAKER_10]: What's up, sexy gal?

57
00:04:29,585 --> 00:04:30,186
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I know.

58
00:04:30,206 --> 00:04:30,826
[SPEAKER_10]: What is it, the...

59
00:04:47,728 --> 00:04:54,411
[SPEAKER_10]: My Say Sexiest Person Alive Award Actually, if you really want to... Copy and paste this to ten people or else you'll be ugly tomorrow.

60
00:04:54,451 --> 00:05:00,154
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, if you do have the Xbox Live Vision camera, you can send wonderful pictures like that.

61
00:05:00,194 --> 00:05:06,196
[SPEAKER_09]: You may have to take a picture of your computer monitor or something like that with the image on there, but you could.

62
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:10,598
[SPEAKER_10]: Or girls can just take pictures of their tits and guys can take pictures of their wangs.

63
00:05:10,798 --> 00:05:14,280
[SPEAKER_09]: I approve all pictures of women's tits sent to my...

64
00:05:15,258 --> 00:05:17,360
[SPEAKER_11]: Not all of them.

65
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,201
[SPEAKER_09]: You'll redirect the wangs to your wife.

66
00:05:21,163 --> 00:05:25,566
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just going to take a picture of someone pooing and be like, this is what I think of you.

67
00:05:26,186 --> 00:05:27,047
[SPEAKER_12]: Stop posting this crap.

68
00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:30,369
[SPEAKER_09]: Irene's going to send pictures of two girls, one cup to her whole friends list.

69
00:05:40,884 --> 00:05:43,265
[SPEAKER_09]: You can make that your icon, you know, using the vision camera.

70
00:05:43,285 --> 00:05:48,669
[SPEAKER_10]: You remember a while back when Microsoft was banning people for 24 hours for questionable bio lines?

71
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:54,532
[SPEAKER_10]: I wonder if anybody's tried Two Girls, One Cup fan to see if that gets them banned.

72
00:05:56,413 --> 00:06:00,196
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't see why that would be offensive, just putting something like that.

73
00:06:01,616 --> 00:06:02,937
[SPEAKER_12]: Because it's not offensive.

74
00:06:02,957 --> 00:06:05,239
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, oh my god, you said Two Girls, One Cup.

75
00:06:05,379 --> 00:06:06,820
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, we ban you.

76
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:15,204
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow, moving on to other things that will soon be on Xbox Live.

77
00:06:15,304 --> 00:06:16,185
[SPEAKER_10]: Bioshock!

78
00:06:16,926 --> 00:06:22,672
[SPEAKER_10]: We've all been waiting for some more content for the game Bioshock, and a patch is going to be coming out soon.

79
00:06:23,292 --> 00:06:26,775
[SPEAKER_10]: It's actually going to have downloadable content with the patch.

80
00:06:27,676 --> 00:06:29,797
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, the patch is going to enable this downloadable content.

81
00:06:30,177 --> 00:06:34,221
[SPEAKER_10]: I assume, isn't the patch supposed to fix the widescreen thing too, or has that already been done?

82
00:06:34,681 --> 00:06:35,522
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it's going to do that.

83
00:06:35,662 --> 00:06:38,044
[SPEAKER_10]: I see, so that's the whole thing that this patch is fixing.

84
00:06:38,704 --> 00:06:45,609
[SPEAKER_10]: The new downloadable content will, I assume, be a new level or something, but they don't really say a lot about what it is.

85
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:46,790
[SPEAKER_10]: Ooh, new plasmids.

86
00:06:47,251 --> 00:06:52,915
[SPEAKER_09]: New plasmids, and there's supposed to be a new difficulty in there that's going to disable the Vita Chambers.

87
00:06:53,328 --> 00:06:53,588
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.

88
00:06:54,688 --> 00:06:56,489
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's pretty cool.

89
00:06:56,569 --> 00:06:58,790
[SPEAKER_09]: Guitar Hero 3 had a new download pack.

90
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:02,211
[SPEAKER_09]: This time in the form of some indie love.

91
00:07:03,832 --> 00:07:08,533
[SPEAKER_09]: And included in there are three songs from artists you might not be familiar with.

92
00:07:09,293 --> 00:07:13,615
[SPEAKER_09]: Including you get The State of Massachusetts by Dropkick Murphys.

93
00:07:14,095 --> 00:07:14,855
[SPEAKER_09]: Pretty good punk band.

94
00:07:15,776 --> 00:07:19,337
[SPEAKER_09]: You Should Be Ashamed of Myself by The Bled.

95
00:07:20,132 --> 00:07:24,134
[SPEAKER_09]: and Memories of the Groove by Maylene and the Sons of Disasters.

96
00:07:26,235 --> 00:07:26,676
[SPEAKER_10]: You're fired, Loki.

97
00:07:49,061 --> 00:07:53,203
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not listening to Orange Challenge Radio anymore.

98
00:07:53,243 --> 00:07:55,725
[SPEAKER_12]: You fired Loki.

99
00:07:55,905 --> 00:07:59,988
[SPEAKER_09]: He fired me for a better view of download content for Guitar Hero.

100
00:08:00,088 --> 00:08:00,868
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god.

101
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:02,689
[SPEAKER_09]: Where's one up on my lawn?

102
00:08:06,612 --> 00:08:07,853
[SPEAKER_10]: I do love this show sometimes.

103
00:08:08,253 --> 00:08:10,474
[SPEAKER_10]: Other times it sucks.

104
00:08:11,695 --> 00:08:15,878
[SPEAKER_10]: Xbox Live Arcade is going to be getting a classic game

105
00:08:16,832 --> 00:08:19,513
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, I thought we already had this game on Xbox Live.

106
00:08:19,573 --> 00:08:21,653
[SPEAKER_10]: Chess is going to be coming to Xbox Live.

107
00:08:21,693 --> 00:08:23,014
[SPEAKER_10]: Isn't that part of the Spyglass?

108
00:08:23,234 --> 00:08:24,534
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, Chess Master, though.

109
00:08:24,614 --> 00:08:30,876
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, it's Chess Master, specifically the Chess Master series, which was a huge series on PC, from what I remember.

110
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:32,696
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, every year there was a new Chess Master game.

111
00:08:33,276 --> 00:08:35,197
[SPEAKER_10]: But all I know is that it isn't Battle Chess.

112
00:08:35,717 --> 00:08:37,257
[SPEAKER_10]: So for that, epic fail.

113
00:08:37,758 --> 00:08:38,558
[SPEAKER_10]: Or Battleship.

114
00:08:38,938 --> 00:08:40,258
[SPEAKER_10]: I want Battleship in life.

115
00:08:40,498 --> 00:08:42,039
[SPEAKER_10]: Battleship is kind of hokey.

116
00:08:42,079 --> 00:08:43,299
[SPEAKER_10]: Why are you beeping over there?

117
00:08:43,655 --> 00:08:48,777
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not... My new phone is... Because someone sunk her battleship, apparently.

118
00:08:49,297 --> 00:08:51,058
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, Chess Master is going to be coming to Xbox Live Arcade.

119
00:08:51,298 --> 00:08:55,120
[SPEAKER_10]: Hopefully it's a little better and a little polished than the Spyglass thing was.

120
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:59,181
[SPEAKER_10]: It's supposed to have lots of different AI opponents of varying difficulty.

121
00:08:59,721 --> 00:09:00,102
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see.

122
00:09:00,842 --> 00:09:01,902
[SPEAKER_10]: Camera support as well.

123
00:09:02,703 --> 00:09:03,223
[SPEAKER_10]: So we'll see.

124
00:09:04,903 --> 00:09:08,885
[SPEAKER_09]: I would say, coming to Xbox Live Arcade very soon,

125
00:09:09,542 --> 00:09:11,305
[SPEAKER_09]: The Sensible World of Soccer

126
00:09:27,378 --> 00:09:29,639
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, soccer fans are pretty rowdy sometimes.

127
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:31,559
[SPEAKER_10]: The game actually looked kind of fun.

128
00:09:31,599 --> 00:09:32,319
[SPEAKER_10]: I saw a trailer.

129
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:33,540
[SPEAKER_10]: I never played this game.

130
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:36,401
[SPEAKER_10]: As much of a Commodore fan as I was back in the day, I didn't have an Amiga.

131
00:09:36,421 --> 00:09:40,362
[SPEAKER_10]: I only ever had a Commodore 64, so I never really played this game.

132
00:09:40,782 --> 00:09:42,482
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, Sensible World of Soccer.

133
00:09:42,683 --> 00:09:47,204
[SPEAKER_09]: It's coming to Xbox Live Arcade on December 19th.

134
00:09:48,064 --> 00:09:48,584
[SPEAKER_12]: Wow.

135
00:09:48,644 --> 00:09:50,045
[SPEAKER_09]: So, hooray.

136
00:09:51,205 --> 00:09:51,865
[SPEAKER_09]: Be excited.

137
00:09:54,086 --> 00:09:54,266
[SPEAKER_09]: Hmm.

138
00:09:54,716 --> 00:09:55,397
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

139
00:09:55,737 --> 00:09:56,198
[SPEAKER_09]: You know me.

140
00:09:56,518 --> 00:09:57,199
[SPEAKER_09]: Stupid American.

141
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:58,159
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't like soccer.

142
00:09:58,179 --> 00:10:00,442
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkTetsuya says it looks like a Game Boy Color game.

143
00:10:01,222 --> 00:10:03,945
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't look like a Game Boy Color game, but it does look like a Super Nintendo game.

144
00:10:03,965 --> 00:10:05,747
[SPEAKER_10]: It's an older computer system, you know?

145
00:10:06,067 --> 00:10:06,427
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, yeah.

146
00:10:06,447 --> 00:10:07,749
[SPEAKER_10]: It's supposed to look a little older.

147
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:14,155
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of the games on live arcade look a little crappy because they're old 80s game ports.

148
00:10:14,255 --> 00:10:17,018
[SPEAKER_09]: But hey, it might play better than Pro Evo 2008.

149
00:10:17,118 --> 00:10:19,140
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, yeah, because it's sensible.

150
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,660
[SPEAKER_10]: Xbox 360 Backwards Compatibility Update

151
00:10:39,807 --> 00:10:41,227
[SPEAKER_10]: that are backwards compatible.

152
00:10:42,068 --> 00:11:03,935
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of the highlights of games that are now in there, Blitz the League, Blood Omen 2, Burnout 2, Point of Impact, Fight Night Round 3, Forgotten Realms, Demon's Stone, Freedom Fighters, a lot of sports games like MVP Baseball, 03, 04, 05, NCAA March Madness, 05, 06,

153
00:11:07,094 --> 00:11:14,498
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of NHL games, 2K3, 205, 2K... 2K3's on there twice, I think they cheated.

154
00:11:15,698 --> 00:11:16,759
[SPEAKER_10]: NHL 2K3.

155
00:11:17,579 --> 00:11:19,960
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, there's NFL and NHL, my bad, one letter off.

156
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,021
[SPEAKER_10]: Playboy The Mansion!

157
00:11:21,761 --> 00:11:23,542
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure a lot of folks are looking forward to that.

158
00:11:23,862 --> 00:11:27,023
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's the one game on the entire list that I actually own for whatever reason.

159
00:11:27,364 --> 00:11:31,405
[SPEAKER_10]: Tecmo Classic Arcade is now backwards compatible as well.

160
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:34,727
[SPEAKER_10]: I know Loki owns this game, this is worth noting.

161
00:11:35,185 --> 00:11:37,566
[SPEAKER_10]: The Guy Game, Worms 3D, Not Playable Still, Good Games, Rising,

162
00:11:57,182 --> 00:12:00,584
[SPEAKER_10]: Dance Dance Revolution series, still not playable, backwards compatible.

163
00:12:00,824 --> 00:12:03,446
[SPEAKER_12]: Wow, I should be clamoring to get an Xbox 360.

164
00:12:03,486 --> 00:12:08,589
[SPEAKER_09]: Beyond Good and Evil, I think.

165
00:12:09,049 --> 00:12:15,473
[SPEAKER_09]: One interesting thing, the Xbox Live video marketplace is going to be coming to Europe pretty soon.

166
00:12:15,954 --> 00:12:19,956
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is actually coming from one of those prepaid cards.

167
00:12:20,316 --> 00:12:23,638
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, written on the back in very small print, said...

168
00:12:24,898 --> 00:12:31,400
[SPEAKER_09]: You can access the Xbox Live video marketplace available in the UK, Ireland, France, and Germany.

169
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:37,721
[SPEAKER_09]: So apparently this hasn't happened soon, but the cards, being already printed, have that information on there.

170
00:12:37,881 --> 00:12:47,004
[SPEAKER_09]: So soon you will be able to watch videos and enjoy all the rest of the download content that we have around the world.

171
00:12:49,124 --> 00:12:49,824
[SPEAKER_09]: Be excited.

172
00:12:51,545 --> 00:12:51,945
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not.

173
00:12:52,830 --> 00:13:08,478
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if you saw this hit the internet earlier this week, but there was a video that went out on the internet that... It was kind of a social experiment, I guess you could call it, where a guy whose nickname was XGayboyX signed on to Halo 3.

174
00:13:08,518 --> 00:13:09,518
[SPEAKER_09]: Triple X, Gayboy.

175
00:13:09,558 --> 00:13:10,659
[SPEAKER_10]: Was it Triple X, GayboyX?

176
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:11,139
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry about that.

177
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:17,282
[SPEAKER_10]: He signed on to Halo 3 and basically got all these people to say, really, now...

178
00:13:18,493 --> 00:13:19,313
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see you next time.

179
00:13:39,722 --> 00:13:40,863
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

180
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:52,011
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, what's up, gay boy?

181
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:55,813
[SPEAKER_04]: We should hook up.

182
00:13:56,174 --> 00:13:56,974
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm Friendly Uncle.

183
00:13:57,374 --> 00:13:59,516
[SPEAKER_04]: Gay boy and Friendly Uncle coming at ya.

184
00:14:00,336 --> 00:14:02,818
[SPEAKER_10]: Something that should be noted, because you notice, like, that isn't so bad.

185
00:14:02,878 --> 00:14:06,661
[SPEAKER_10]: There are a few things in here that are not necessarily negative.

186
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:08,242
[SPEAKER_10]: For instance, you know, but

187
00:14:08,735 --> 00:14:16,280
[SPEAKER_10]: Who knows if it's somebody... You know how, like, sometimes jocks in high school would befriend the nerds on a dare type thing?

188
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:17,921
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't know if maybe it's something like that.

189
00:14:17,961 --> 00:14:18,441
[SPEAKER_10]: But I doubt it.

190
00:14:18,481 --> 00:14:19,262
[SPEAKER_10]: It seems pretty genuine.

191
00:14:20,062 --> 00:14:20,763
[SPEAKER_04]: One, two, punch.

192
00:14:21,203 --> 00:14:22,784
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope gay marriage never gets passed.

193
00:14:23,244 --> 00:14:24,265
[SPEAKER_04]: Have fun being single.

194
00:14:25,586 --> 00:14:29,448
[SPEAKER_03]: And make it say, single boy.

195
00:14:29,949 --> 00:14:30,649
[SPEAKER_03]: Shut the fuck up.

196
00:14:31,009 --> 00:14:31,890
[SPEAKER_03]: You're still a faggot.

197
00:14:32,871 --> 00:14:35,772
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it doesn't matter, dude, because... I'm sorry, you're not a faggot.

198
00:14:35,793 --> 00:14:37,093
[SPEAKER_03]: You give a bad name to gays.

199
00:14:37,614 --> 00:14:37,874
[SPEAKER_03]: You're...

200
00:14:38,863 --> 00:14:40,024
[SPEAKER_03]: A fucking nuke!

201
00:14:41,564 --> 00:14:42,164
[SPEAKER_10]: You're a niggit!

202
00:14:42,264 --> 00:14:43,025
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't worry, guys.

203
00:14:43,445 --> 00:14:43,985
[SPEAKER_10]: Ah, there you go.

204
00:14:44,585 --> 00:14:45,226
[SPEAKER_10]: That's enough.

205
00:14:45,246 --> 00:14:45,406
[SPEAKER_12]: Wow.

206
00:14:45,706 --> 00:14:53,369
[SPEAKER_12]: If I hadn't already heard all this stuff before in games, like, I'd probably be a little more shocked, but that's still very perturbing.

207
00:14:53,409 --> 00:14:55,190
[SPEAKER_12]: It's really, like, I don't know.

208
00:14:56,331 --> 00:14:58,012
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

209
00:15:24,176 --> 00:15:39,641
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, in a way, and I'm a little bit torn, because yes, I think these people are really fucked up, and yes, I think it's fucking sad that there's ignorant people like that out there, but at the same time, it's a little bit entrapment or provoking it when the guy goes on there with a name like Gay Boy.

210
00:15:40,321 --> 00:15:41,862
[SPEAKER_12]: But I don't see it that way.

211
00:15:41,962 --> 00:15:45,683
[SPEAKER_12]: Why does it have to be seen as entrapment if you have a name like Gay Boy?

212
00:15:45,703 --> 00:15:46,703
[SPEAKER_09]: How about Hetero Boy?

213
00:15:46,723 --> 00:15:49,764
[SPEAKER_09]: I would be interested to see what Hetero Boy would

214
00:15:50,652 --> 00:15:52,934
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, like, that's dumb.

215
00:15:53,455 --> 00:15:53,855
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

216
00:15:54,316 --> 00:15:56,958
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, on the one hand, I'm infuriated.

217
00:15:57,018 --> 00:16:00,041
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm kind of, like, livid that people would say that kind of stuff.

218
00:16:00,101 --> 00:16:01,863
[SPEAKER_09]: Or I heart Jesus or something like that.

219
00:16:02,363 --> 00:16:06,768
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, but at the same time, it's just kind of like, well, you know, successful.

220
00:16:07,281 --> 00:16:08,042
[SPEAKER_09]: That was funny, though.

221
00:16:08,082 --> 00:16:11,064
[SPEAKER_09]: This is why I only like to play with friends and OLR listeners.

222
00:16:11,284 --> 00:16:17,789
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to say, like, Fox News or somebody ran some sort of report on this, and they were talking about, like... I saw that, about the trash talk.

223
00:16:17,829 --> 00:16:19,551
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, there's some other YouTube out there.

224
00:16:19,571 --> 00:16:21,052
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, Fox just did a report this week.

225
00:16:21,332 --> 00:16:21,752
[SPEAKER_09]: I saw that.

226
00:16:21,832 --> 00:16:25,655
[SPEAKER_09]: And the whole thing was, like, they're all, you know, are you guys surprised that this is on there?

227
00:16:25,695 --> 00:16:27,057
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're like, no.

228
00:16:27,337 --> 00:16:31,180
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, like, I remember reading some comments on that, and they're like, yeah, of course they're not surprised.

229
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,181
[SPEAKER_09]: They're the ones fucking saying that shit.

230
00:16:33,201 --> 00:16:35,944
[SPEAKER_09]: They're interviewing, like, 12-year-olds and stuff, 13-year-olds.

231
00:16:37,927 --> 00:16:42,549
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, the reason why I want to bring this up is that, you know, obviously these things make their way around the Internet.

232
00:16:42,609 --> 00:16:53,153
[SPEAKER_10]: And if anybody, Microsoft has proven they're very good about kind of staying on top of the Internet buzz and trying to thwomp this mob mentality when they see it.

233
00:16:53,513 --> 00:17:03,682
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, one of their representatives, Trixie, was actually posting on the GayGamer.net blog post where this showed up and just trying to kind of, you know, say, hey, I think these guys are assholes too.

234
00:17:04,263 --> 00:17:07,646
[SPEAKER_10]: And when you see this happen, report it because we do follow up on that shit.

235
00:17:07,966 --> 00:17:09,968
[SPEAKER_10]: And Major Nelson basically kind of says the same thing.

236
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:14,912
[SPEAKER_10]: Major Nelson posts about it in his blog and says, I just watched or listened to the video you posted on your site.

237
00:17:14,932 --> 00:17:17,655
[SPEAKER_10]: This is what he wrote back to GayGamer.net who posted the original thing.

238
00:17:18,055 --> 00:17:21,098
[SPEAKER_10]: Needless to say, it was disappointing to see how some Xbox Live members behaved.

239
00:17:21,478 --> 00:17:23,540
[SPEAKER_10]: As you know, that's not the type of behavior we support.

240
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:26,803
[SPEAKER_10]: With over 8 million members, it's unfortunate that some members decide to act like this.

241
00:17:27,343 --> 00:17:31,867
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to point out a few things that all Xbox Live members can do to ensure an enjoyable experience.

242
00:17:32,228 --> 00:17:38,033
[SPEAKER_10]: And reiterates, you know, you can turn off voice from people that aren't your friends, only play with friends, file complaints.

243
00:17:38,133 --> 00:17:43,037
[SPEAKER_10]: And he reiterates, we do act on complaints, so I highly encourage people to file complaints where appropriate.

244
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,260
[SPEAKER_10]: And you know what?

245
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:44,880
[SPEAKER_10]: I do that.

246
00:17:45,261 --> 00:17:54,544
[SPEAKER_10]: When I play on Xbox Live, if somebody is, like, being annoying, because some people will get, I swear to God, you'll get on Halo 3 and you'll get into some matches and somebody will be doing this the whole time.

247
00:17:55,484 --> 00:17:59,186
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

248
00:18:04,685 --> 00:18:10,030
[SPEAKER_10]: I swear to God, for the entire match, somebody did that to me once.

249
00:18:11,191 --> 00:18:15,294
[SPEAKER_10]: That's kind of funny, but then if I ever met that person in real life, I'd punch him.

250
00:18:15,314 --> 00:18:19,318
[SPEAKER_10]: I muted the little fucker, finally, so he was just sitting there by himself.

251
00:18:20,719 --> 00:18:23,522
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe he had a mental problem, I don't know.

252
00:18:23,542 --> 00:18:25,323
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what I was going to say, maybe he had a headache.

253
00:18:25,443 --> 00:18:28,426
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think the mental problem was that severe because he was kicking my ass in Halo.

254
00:18:30,103 --> 00:18:33,464
[SPEAKER_10]: The other, well, maybe he's like Rain Man or something.

255
00:18:33,744 --> 00:18:37,745
[SPEAKER_11]: He's really good at Halo, but he just says, meh, meh, meh, meh, a lot.

256
00:18:37,845 --> 00:18:41,326
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, like, that could be his thing, but, yeah.

257
00:18:42,507 --> 00:18:45,807
[SPEAKER_10]: So what I did, I muted him, and then I rated the fucker down.

258
00:18:46,048 --> 00:18:47,468
[SPEAKER_10]: You go into the little thing, and you can rate.

259
00:18:48,028 --> 00:18:50,929
[SPEAKER_10]: And you know how, like, everybody on Xbox Live has a five-star rating?

260
00:18:51,812 --> 00:18:53,373
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, not if you play with me in Halo 3.

261
00:18:53,733 --> 00:18:57,814
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll rate you down so fast if you get on there and say something nasty.

262
00:18:57,914 --> 00:19:05,217
[SPEAKER_10]: And I had somebody get on there going, you know, n-word, n-word, n-word over and over and I reported it as abuse.

263
00:19:06,057 --> 00:19:07,258
[SPEAKER_12]: That's just disgusting.

264
00:19:07,378 --> 00:19:08,938
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, it's gross.

265
00:19:08,978 --> 00:19:09,839
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like, why do you have to say that?

266
00:19:09,859 --> 00:19:15,061
[SPEAKER_10]: Because Mommy and Daddy aren't looking and they're acting out to make themselves feel better about themselves.

267
00:19:15,081 --> 00:19:21,123
[SPEAKER_09]: Because Mommy and Daddy bought them an M-rated game and obviously aren't paying attention to what they do and they'll pay for their damn live account because

268
00:19:21,547 --> 00:19:25,912
[SPEAKER_09]: Give Mommy and Daddy a few moments to breathe and make more babies.

269
00:19:26,432 --> 00:19:26,613
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

270
00:19:27,494 --> 00:19:28,715
[SPEAKER_10]: Frisbee brings up a good point.

271
00:19:28,795 --> 00:19:29,396
[SPEAKER_10]: Is he a cat?

272
00:19:31,709 --> 00:19:34,430
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh God, I hope I wasn't getting my ass kicked by a cat.

273
00:19:34,831 --> 00:19:35,871
[SPEAKER_10]: Laser cat.

274
00:19:35,911 --> 00:19:37,131
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be kind of sad.

275
00:19:37,171 --> 00:19:39,132
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I'd have to quit video gaming forever.

276
00:19:39,212 --> 00:19:40,453
[SPEAKER_10]: Man, that must be a stupid cat.

277
00:19:40,753 --> 00:19:42,513
[SPEAKER_11]: Meow, meow, meow, meow.

278
00:19:43,414 --> 00:19:44,674
[SPEAKER_11]: You can't even meow right.

279
00:19:44,754 --> 00:19:45,634
[SPEAKER_11]: Shut up, cat.

280
00:19:46,755 --> 00:19:47,475
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm muting you.

281
00:19:47,635 --> 00:19:50,336
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, my cat couldn't meow right for a while.

282
00:19:50,476 --> 00:19:51,757
[SPEAKER_09]: It took her time to figure it out.

283
00:19:51,777 --> 00:19:53,737
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, I really had to restrain myself from meowing.

284
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:56,438
[SPEAKER_09]: Stupid faggot cat, stop meowing so fucking much.

285
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:58,039
[SPEAKER_11]: N-word, N-word cat, jeez.

286
00:19:59,884 --> 00:20:01,565
[SPEAKER_11]: Black Cat, what's that, huh?

287
00:20:04,547 --> 00:20:05,948
[SPEAKER_10]: That's terrible.

288
00:20:05,968 --> 00:20:07,569
[SPEAKER_10]: Sephiroth1215 says something else really good.

289
00:20:07,969 --> 00:20:09,010
[SPEAKER_10]: Listen to these people, though.

290
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:10,691
[SPEAKER_10]: They're not really 12 and 13.

291
00:20:10,771 --> 00:20:12,332
[SPEAKER_10]: These people are usually in their 20s.

292
00:20:12,792 --> 00:20:16,015
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, those people did sound a little bit older, but they sounded like hicks, too.

293
00:20:16,175 --> 00:20:18,096
[SPEAKER_10]: They sounded like frat boys in a dorm room.

294
00:20:19,617 --> 00:20:20,397
[SPEAKER_09]: Gay boy.

295
00:20:22,038 --> 00:20:22,399
[SPEAKER_09]: Look at this.

296
00:20:22,539 --> 00:20:24,020
[SPEAKER_09]: I just totally told this guy.

297
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,881
[SPEAKER_09]: Man, I'm awesome.

298
00:20:26,587 --> 00:20:27,548
[SPEAKER_09]: Doyle Rules!

299
00:20:27,868 --> 00:20:30,230
[SPEAKER_12]: See, and they all have lame nicknames too.

300
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:33,932
[SPEAKER_12]: It's usually like, oh, Halo Lover and stuff like that.

301
00:20:33,992 --> 00:20:35,793
[SPEAKER_12]: Or like, I love unicorns or something.

302
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:37,935
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, how could you make fun of a name gay boy?

303
00:20:37,955 --> 00:20:39,056
[SPEAKER_10]: Master Chief is my butt buddy.

304
00:20:39,256 --> 00:20:40,076
[SPEAKER_12]: Exactly!

305
00:20:40,216 --> 00:20:41,337
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, and he really is.

306
00:20:41,737 --> 00:20:44,019
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, they're stupid.

307
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:45,820
[SPEAKER_12]: They can't think of anything more creative.

308
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:51,504
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, a more creative way to make fun of someone instead of gay boy.

309
00:20:51,624 --> 00:20:52,465
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, you're gay.

310
00:20:52,865 --> 00:20:53,886
[SPEAKER_11]: And you're a boy.

311
00:20:54,066 --> 00:20:54,206
[SPEAKER_11]: Like,

312
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,600
[SPEAKER_11]: That's stupid.

313
00:20:55,820 --> 00:21:03,044
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's just, the parts of it that are really significant to me is that people will suddenly jump on there and then they'll be like, I hope gay marriage is banned forever and you're single forever.

314
00:21:03,084 --> 00:21:03,825
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like, dude.

315
00:21:04,345 --> 00:21:04,885
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, wow.

316
00:21:05,106 --> 00:21:07,907
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just some guy on the internet playing Halo.

317
00:21:07,947 --> 00:21:09,728
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that hurt my ego.

318
00:21:09,748 --> 00:21:12,009
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't fight back in Halo now.

319
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:14,431
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, man.

320
00:21:15,451 --> 00:21:16,192
[SPEAKER_12]: What am I to do?

321
00:21:16,212 --> 00:21:18,233
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

322
00:21:18,253 --> 00:21:21,535
[SPEAKER_10]: But then Nintendo looks at this shit and goes, that's why we've got friend codes.

323
00:21:23,672 --> 00:21:24,953
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, Nintendo's so smart.

324
00:21:25,713 --> 00:21:26,334
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know about that.

325
00:21:26,534 --> 00:21:26,834
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow.

326
00:21:27,194 --> 00:21:28,395
[SPEAKER_12]: Kicking you, kicking you.

327
00:21:28,415 --> 00:21:30,537
[SPEAKER_09]: So, even more ridiculous news here.

328
00:21:30,737 --> 00:21:42,805
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, there is a guy filing a class action lawsuit because he believes that Microsoft created defective copies of Halo 3 that are causing Xbox 360s to blow up everywhere.

329
00:21:45,446 --> 00:21:46,667
[SPEAKER_12]: No, that wasn't Microsoft.

330
00:21:46,687 --> 00:21:47,187
[SPEAKER_12]: That was me.

331
00:21:47,268 --> 00:21:52,031
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways, apparently this guy out of San Diego, Randy Nunes, is...

332
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:57,504
[SPEAKER_09]: Going ahead with a lawsuit against them.

333
00:21:57,544 --> 00:22:06,369
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, he purchased a copy of Halo 3 from GameStop and was plagued by system lockups and freezes and crashes when he tried to play it.

334
00:22:06,669 --> 00:22:08,210
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, where's the explosions?

335
00:22:09,631 --> 00:22:11,352
[SPEAKER_09]: I was being sarcastic!

336
00:22:11,432 --> 00:22:16,455
[SPEAKER_10]: If you blow up the 360, I'm thinking I put Halo, close it, and then suddenly, tick, tick, tick, BOOM!

337
00:22:17,216 --> 00:22:18,096
[SPEAKER_10]: Sarcasm, okay.

338
00:22:18,256 --> 00:22:19,317
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd be actually kind of rad.

339
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,001
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd buy another one.

340
00:22:21,101 --> 00:22:22,103
[SPEAKER_09]: I would not.

341
00:22:23,004 --> 00:22:27,790
[SPEAKER_09]: Did he try a different copy of the game, return a defective one, the game stopped for replacement?

342
00:22:29,993 --> 00:22:30,754
[SPEAKER_09]: The story doesn't say.

343
00:22:31,294 --> 00:22:32,376
[SPEAKER_12]: No, he was using a 360.

344
00:22:34,158 --> 00:22:34,939
[SPEAKER_09]: But here's the thing, though.

345
00:22:35,239 --> 00:22:35,480
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean...

346
00:22:36,764 --> 00:22:43,408
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a bunch of bullshit anyways, because I remember this story came out before that, oh, maybe Halo's breaking systems.

347
00:22:43,508 --> 00:22:46,970
[SPEAKER_09]: No, actually it's because you're playing the game so much that your system's overheating.

348
00:22:47,411 --> 00:22:51,953
[SPEAKER_09]: If you happen to have that overheating problem, then you get three rings of death or whatever.

349
00:22:53,074 --> 00:22:53,775
[SPEAKER_09]: It's stupid.

350
00:22:54,115 --> 00:22:57,157
[SPEAKER_09]: And the fact that this guy's getting sued for this shit, I hope he fails.

351
00:22:57,637 --> 00:23:00,759
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, unfortunately nowadays a lot of times these people succeed.

352
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:05,482
[SPEAKER_10]: And of course, whenever we hear about the frivolous lawsuits, we get a little bit angsty.

353
00:23:06,151 --> 00:23:09,721
[SPEAKER_10]: and nothing inspires our next segment like frivolous lawsuits.

354
00:23:09,801 --> 00:23:12,108
[SPEAKER_10]: It's time to bring on the FUs of the week.

355
00:23:27,717 --> 00:23:45,965
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, I guess I would say this is a pre-FU for my work review that's going to be this week, which I'm demanding a raise, which I'm sure I will not get, but I haven't gotten one in three years, and I'm well deserving of one, since I have four times the accounts that certain other sales reps do at my company.

356
00:23:47,326 --> 00:23:52,328
[SPEAKER_09]: So, basically, my whole thing is I'm going to go in there and just say, okay, am I getting a review or not?

357
00:23:52,388 --> 00:23:54,529
[SPEAKER_09]: And if I'm not, then I'm going to be a complete asshole.

358
00:23:54,769 --> 00:23:55,189
[SPEAKER_02]: You should.

359
00:23:55,769 --> 00:23:56,750
[SPEAKER_09]: So, fuck you...

360
00:23:57,745 --> 00:24:02,888
[SPEAKER_09]: Stupid managers at my work that aren't, you know, willing to pay me a decent salary.

361
00:24:02,929 --> 00:24:04,209
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm already underpaid as it is.

362
00:24:04,269 --> 00:24:07,271
[SPEAKER_09]: If I get a fucking raise, then I'll be just slightly less underpaid.

363
00:24:10,433 --> 00:24:11,094
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll go next.

364
00:24:11,194 --> 00:24:13,856
[SPEAKER_10]: My FU of the week goes to the fact that I don't own a house.

365
00:24:14,176 --> 00:24:15,297
[SPEAKER_10]: I rent, but I don't own.

366
00:24:16,117 --> 00:24:18,339
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I went to a party last night with William.

367
00:24:18,379 --> 00:24:21,461
[SPEAKER_10]: These guys own this house, and it was just beautiful what they'd done with it.

368
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:23,302
[SPEAKER_10]: The backyard was all, like...

369
00:24:23,792 --> 00:24:25,013
[SPEAKER_10]: FU to cats that can't meow properly.

370
00:24:25,093 --> 00:24:26,054
[SPEAKER_10]: They need to, uh... Meow meow meow meow!

371
00:24:51,175 --> 00:24:52,036
[SPEAKER_12]: Shut up, cat!

372
00:24:53,757 --> 00:24:54,717
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, that's it.

373
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:56,938
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

374
00:24:57,919 --> 00:24:59,400
[SPEAKER_10]: That does it for the FUs of the week.

375
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:00,981
[SPEAKER_12]: That was really short.

376
00:25:01,241 --> 00:25:01,601
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

377
00:25:01,901 --> 00:25:04,262
[SPEAKER_12]: Usually there's a lot of angst built up for this.

378
00:25:04,502 --> 00:25:06,403
[SPEAKER_10]: It's because we stopped reading chat FUs.

379
00:25:06,424 --> 00:25:07,864
[SPEAKER_10]: In the same way, it got a lot shorter.

380
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:10,346
[SPEAKER_12]: Wow, that lasted like a minute and a half.

381
00:25:12,007 --> 00:25:15,829
[SPEAKER_10]: Black Labs in chat says, An internet radio will not be getting you a house, Rob.

382
00:25:16,689 --> 00:25:18,470
[SPEAKER_10]: Truer words have not been spoken.

383
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:19,711
[SPEAKER_12]: Wait a minute, what?

384
00:25:19,751 --> 00:25:19,851
[SPEAKER_12]: What?

385
00:25:20,595 --> 00:25:20,795
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

386
00:25:20,855 --> 00:25:21,655
[SPEAKER_12]: Nonbeliever.

387
00:25:23,576 --> 00:25:23,856
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

388
00:25:23,936 --> 00:25:24,377
[SPEAKER_10]: Where's that?

389
00:25:24,457 --> 00:25:25,617
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that a chat name or something?

390
00:25:26,077 --> 00:25:26,237
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

391
00:25:26,798 --> 00:25:29,239
[SPEAKER_12]: And internet radio will not be getting you a house, Rob.

392
00:25:29,399 --> 00:25:29,619
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

393
00:25:29,959 --> 00:25:30,859
[SPEAKER_12]: So you think.

394
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,620
[SPEAKER_12]: You don't know.

395
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:33,321
[SPEAKER_10]: Rob.

396
00:25:33,361 --> 00:25:33,701
[SPEAKER_10]: Geez.

397
00:25:33,761 --> 00:25:34,001
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

398
00:25:34,541 --> 00:25:34,981
[SPEAKER_09]: I have to.

399
00:25:35,161 --> 00:25:36,582
[SPEAKER_09]: No, Eidos is building me a house.

400
00:25:37,082 --> 00:25:38,803
[SPEAKER_09]: I have to divert our attention real quick.

401
00:25:38,903 --> 00:25:40,844
[SPEAKER_09]: There's the last minute story.

402
00:25:41,124 --> 00:25:42,444
[SPEAKER_09]: And I need you to pull this up.

403
00:25:42,805 --> 00:25:44,605
[SPEAKER_09]: Gamersreports.com.

404
00:25:45,586 --> 00:25:46,506
[SPEAKER_09]: This better be good.

405
00:25:46,526 --> 00:25:48,287
[SPEAKER_09]: Has a brand new trailer.

406
00:25:49,687 --> 00:25:52,429
[SPEAKER_11]: for... for... Africa.

407
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:54,811
[SPEAKER_09]: GamersReports.com?

408
00:25:54,831 --> 00:25:57,894
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, Gamers with an S, Reports.com.

409
00:25:57,934 --> 00:25:58,174
[SPEAKER_09]: Aha!

410
00:25:59,015 --> 00:25:59,195
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh!

411
00:25:59,495 --> 00:26:00,096
[SPEAKER_09]: New Africa.

412
00:26:00,156 --> 00:26:02,057
[SPEAKER_09]: A new Africa trailer for the PS3.

413
00:26:02,338 --> 00:26:03,358
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we should watch.

414
00:26:03,639 --> 00:26:05,500
[SPEAKER_09]: Is this real or is this something to be seen?

415
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,962
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's real.

416
00:26:08,002 --> 00:26:08,503
Oh, okay.

417
00:26:08,583 --> 00:26:09,584
[SPEAKER_09]: And it has a song.

418
00:26:09,664 --> 00:26:09,884
Oh, shit!

419
00:26:09,964 --> 00:26:10,364
Oh, shit!

420
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:26,262
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to know what is worthy about interrupting the show with this.

421
00:26:26,302 --> 00:26:27,463
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

422
00:26:27,543 --> 00:26:28,904
[SPEAKER_11]: I just... I forgot.

423
00:26:29,184 --> 00:26:31,006
[SPEAKER_10]: Do we get to find out what the hell you do in this game?

424
00:26:31,286 --> 00:26:31,906
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

425
00:26:32,086 --> 00:26:35,389
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't watch the whole trailer.

426
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:38,952
[SPEAKER_10]: I see dudes riding a jeep.

427
00:26:39,112 --> 00:26:39,632
I don't know.

428
00:26:48,433 --> 00:26:49,614
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a retarded cat.

429
00:26:49,694 --> 00:26:52,415
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I'm just kidding.

430
00:26:53,576 --> 00:26:56,437
[SPEAKER_12]: So basically there's just a bunch of animals walking around.

431
00:26:56,477 --> 00:26:57,277
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what?

432
00:26:57,357 --> 00:26:58,698
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks gorgeous.

433
00:26:58,778 --> 00:27:01,199
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, this is something I'm sure that's going to really show off.

434
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:04,001
[SPEAKER_10]: Can I fast forward a little bit?

435
00:27:04,121 --> 00:27:06,782
[SPEAKER_10]: Hopefully see if we get to the part where the animals get shot.

436
00:27:06,822 --> 00:27:07,802
[SPEAKER_11]: Hyena, the unicorn.

437
00:27:13,462 --> 00:27:14,983
[SPEAKER_10]: Where's the fucking game?

438
00:27:15,683 --> 00:27:17,444
[SPEAKER_12]: Where's the fucking dysentery?

439
00:27:18,444 --> 00:27:21,185
[SPEAKER_12]: Goddammit, this is the most boring game ever.

440
00:27:21,205 --> 00:27:23,725
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, hey!

441
00:27:23,826 --> 00:27:25,166
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, the hippo is saying hi.

442
00:27:25,206 --> 00:27:25,946
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, like...

443
00:27:29,068 --> 00:27:31,789
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for watching!

444
00:27:49,038 --> 00:27:56,024
[SPEAKER_09]: It makes me think it's Jumbo Safari, like every time I see it and I see the little... I want to be able to hit all the animals with that jeep.

445
00:27:56,104 --> 00:27:58,066
[SPEAKER_09]: That is the only way I'm buying that game.

446
00:27:58,086 --> 00:27:59,267
[SPEAKER_12]: Are you going to summon the jeep?

447
00:28:00,508 --> 00:28:03,090
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, goddammit, that wasn't worth stopping the show for.

448
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:05,092
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, it's Africa.

449
00:28:05,412 --> 00:28:06,233
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I had to.

450
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:08,735
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow, that's... It could be interesting.

451
00:28:08,755 --> 00:28:09,055
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what?

452
00:28:09,135 --> 00:28:11,356
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm all about games that are outside the box.

453
00:28:11,496 --> 00:28:14,496
[SPEAKER_10]: I just kind of want to know, like, what's the catch with Africa.

454
00:28:14,516 --> 00:28:15,276
[SPEAKER_10]: That's all I want to know.

455
00:28:15,516 --> 00:28:16,057
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what it is?

456
00:28:16,077 --> 00:28:16,597
[SPEAKER_12]: What's the catch?

457
00:28:16,617 --> 00:28:18,077
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going to be like Manhunt.

458
00:28:18,117 --> 00:28:20,157
[SPEAKER_12]: You get to kill the animals in, like, crazy ways.

459
00:28:20,177 --> 00:28:21,397
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, I doubt it.

460
00:28:21,818 --> 00:28:27,479
[SPEAKER_10]: No, you take, like, a, you know... I think it's some type of exploration game, but I want to know, like, what it is.

461
00:28:28,619 --> 00:28:29,099
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting.

462
00:28:29,319 --> 00:28:29,899
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

463
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:33,420
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, well, stay tuned for more information about Africa.

464
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,080
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, right.

465
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,460
[SPEAKER_09]: In six months.

466
00:28:36,328 --> 00:28:37,208
[SPEAKER_12]: Woop-dee-doo.

467
00:28:37,548 --> 00:28:39,509
[SPEAKER_12]: Man, I'm waiting in eager anticipation for that time.

468
00:28:39,529 --> 00:28:43,749
[SPEAKER_10]: Metal Gear Solid V. Let's move on to the gaming news, shall we?

469
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:51,751
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, here on Orange Dawn Radio, we like to talk about the current systems and everything the kids are playing, so that's why this next article is about the Commodore 64.

470
00:28:51,911 --> 00:28:52,431
[SPEAKER_10]: Whoa!

471
00:28:53,351 --> 00:28:53,911
[SPEAKER_12]: Radical!

472
00:28:54,231 --> 00:29:01,753
[SPEAKER_10]: And, yes, on the Commodore 64, somebody, with a lot of free time, has managed to make a Guitar Hero 3D.

473
00:29:02,273 --> 00:29:04,254
[SPEAKER_10]: Clone type thing for the Commodore 64.

474
00:29:04,334 --> 00:29:06,035
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, I shouldn't say it's a full game yet.

475
00:29:06,415 --> 00:29:07,896
[SPEAKER_10]: It's still in its concept stages.

476
00:29:07,956 --> 00:29:10,097
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's called Shreds 64.

477
00:29:10,998 --> 00:29:17,041
[SPEAKER_10]: And what they did is they took their PlayStation 2 guitar and basically adapted it so that it can be read in the joystick ports.

478
00:29:17,541 --> 00:29:21,784
[SPEAKER_10]: And, yeah, now they've made it so that, you know, the notes fall and it reads the guitar.

479
00:29:22,204 --> 00:29:25,586
[SPEAKER_10]: And they have what's called the Shredocity and the Applause.

480
00:29:25,646 --> 00:29:30,288
[SPEAKER_10]: And the Applause is basically the meter, you know, how well you're doing just looking in the game.

481
00:29:30,308 --> 00:29:31,449
[SPEAKER_10]: And I guess Shredocity is...

482
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:33,490
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

483
00:30:04,067 --> 00:30:04,668
[SPEAKER_10]: Still kind of cool.

484
00:30:05,668 --> 00:30:06,089
[SPEAKER_10]: I like it.

485
00:30:06,249 --> 00:30:07,669
[SPEAKER_10]: I approve of this project.

486
00:30:07,729 --> 00:30:08,230
[SPEAKER_10]: Me too.

487
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:08,750
[SPEAKER_12]: Thumbs up.

488
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:15,474
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, I'm disappointed to see that we don't have a Dreamcast game yet of Guitar Hero or something like that.

489
00:30:16,394 --> 00:30:22,137
[SPEAKER_09]: Because, you know, the Dreamcast has tons of games coming out for some reason, even though... Sure enough.

490
00:30:23,458 --> 00:30:27,480
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways, another mod also kind of dealing with a music game.

491
00:30:28,101 --> 00:30:28,601
[SPEAKER_09]: Rock Band.

492
00:30:28,801 --> 00:30:30,202
[SPEAKER_09]: As you remember me complaining about

493
00:30:30,779 --> 00:30:37,583
[SPEAKER_09]: The drums and how loud they were, apparently a lot of people were looking for homebrew ways of making them quieter.

494
00:30:38,043 --> 00:30:47,088
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's a couple different methods that you can use out there, one of which is self-adhesive rubber and self-adhesive colored felt.

495
00:30:47,648 --> 00:30:49,329
[SPEAKER_09]: And you basically shove that on there.

496
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:51,551
[SPEAKER_12]: Why does it have to be colored felt?

497
00:30:52,251 --> 00:30:57,474
[SPEAKER_09]: Just so that you know which color, because if you're covering the whole drum, you're not going to know what color is what.

498
00:30:58,700 --> 00:30:59,381
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't have to.

499
00:30:59,441 --> 00:31:01,442
[SPEAKER_09]: You can do all black if you're emo like that.

500
00:31:02,063 --> 00:31:02,924
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe I am.

501
00:31:03,464 --> 00:31:04,145
[SPEAKER_09]: So whatever.

502
00:31:04,245 --> 00:31:06,386
[SPEAKER_09]: But there's another one I saw also.

503
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:11,791
[SPEAKER_09]: There was a rubber mouse pad, and you glue that on there.

504
00:31:12,792 --> 00:31:17,216
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, though, it works pretty well in reducing the sound, I guess, by 70%.

505
00:31:17,276 --> 00:31:20,438
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, there you go.

506
00:31:20,498 --> 00:31:22,440
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe the wife will let you play if you can reduce the sound.

507
00:31:23,884 --> 00:31:30,147
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, by the way, she bought Rock Band for me, or she gave me a check for it because I paid with it, my money.

508
00:31:30,328 --> 00:31:37,151
[SPEAKER_09]: But she only paid for $100 of it because she says that the remainder of the money would have been for the drum kit, and she's not supporting the drum kit.

509
00:31:37,171 --> 00:31:39,692
[SPEAKER_11]: That's awesome.

510
00:31:40,153 --> 00:31:41,253
[SPEAKER_10]: Your wife is hilarious.

511
00:31:43,674 --> 00:31:44,995
[SPEAKER_10]: Tell her we need to, I'm going to take her out.

512
00:31:45,015 --> 00:31:46,756
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to go to Olive Garden, have a fancy dinner.

513
00:31:47,817 --> 00:31:48,237
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

514
00:31:48,337 --> 00:31:49,397
[SPEAKER_12]: Happy Olive Garden.

515
00:31:50,238 --> 00:31:51,598
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll take her to Red Lobster if she wants.

516
00:31:51,839 --> 00:31:52,539
[SPEAKER_10]: Spare no expense.

517
00:31:54,124 --> 00:31:55,485
[SPEAKER_10]: BSG Something's getting postponed.

518
00:31:55,605 --> 00:31:56,747
[SPEAKER_10]: It might even be altogether cancelled.

519
00:32:18,911 --> 00:32:19,051
[SPEAKER_12]: What?

520
00:32:19,071 --> 00:32:20,172
[SPEAKER_12]: Because of this damn strike.

521
00:32:20,252 --> 00:32:20,672
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

522
00:32:20,692 --> 00:32:22,173
[SPEAKER_10]: They can't cancel Battlestar Galactica.

523
00:32:22,193 --> 00:32:22,673
[SPEAKER_10]: They can.

524
00:32:22,693 --> 00:32:23,834
[SPEAKER_12]: They sure as shit can.

525
00:32:23,894 --> 00:32:24,435
[SPEAKER_09]: Rawr.

526
00:32:25,375 --> 00:32:27,136
[SPEAKER_09]: Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.

527
00:32:27,156 --> 00:32:31,139
[SPEAKER_09]: To be honest with Heroes, man, I think that's actually kind of good for them.

528
00:32:31,259 --> 00:32:34,081
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I think Heroes has been just fine this season.

529
00:32:34,861 --> 00:32:37,203
[SPEAKER_10]: It just was slow to develop, like the first season.

530
00:32:37,523 --> 00:32:39,024
[SPEAKER_10]: But the past few episodes have been amazing.

531
00:32:39,064 --> 00:32:39,404
[SPEAKER_10]: It's all right.

532
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:40,725
[SPEAKER_10]: And Elle is awesome.

533
00:32:42,026 --> 00:32:44,227
[SPEAKER_10]: I swear to God, if they kill her off Monday, I'm going to be so pissed.

534
00:32:44,287 --> 00:32:44,507
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway...

535
00:32:46,778 --> 00:32:48,419
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

536
00:32:48,439 --> 00:32:50,321
[SPEAKER_09]: I said two of them are supposed to die.

537
00:32:51,081 --> 00:32:51,842
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't remind me.

538
00:32:51,922 --> 00:32:52,322
[SPEAKER_10]: M&L, probably.

539
00:32:52,702 --> 00:32:53,062
[SPEAKER_10]: No!

540
00:32:54,383 --> 00:32:56,305
[SPEAKER_10]: Riders Strike is going on.

541
00:32:56,405 --> 00:33:00,648
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, one thing that they are not striking against is video games.

542
00:33:01,308 --> 00:33:06,612
[SPEAKER_10]: And the Riders Guild is allowed to write for video games currently while this strike is going on.

543
00:33:07,152 --> 00:33:09,454
[SPEAKER_10]: So, something to think about.

544
00:33:10,149 --> 00:33:10,209
[SPEAKER_10]: E.A.

545
00:33:10,229 --> 00:33:11,470
[SPEAKER_10]: did for their European ad campaign.

546
00:33:37,912 --> 00:33:42,413
[SPEAKER_09]: were these two sexy models that were naked to promote the game.

547
00:33:43,374 --> 00:33:44,054
[SPEAKER_09]: I approve.

548
00:33:44,254 --> 00:33:50,636
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, did you guys see the new Wii commercial for... What game was it?

549
00:33:51,056 --> 00:34:00,438
[SPEAKER_12]: Where they're kind of, like, sort of parodying Fast Times at Ridgemont High where the girl's coming out of the pool and they're, like, in bikinis.

550
00:34:01,159 --> 00:34:02,339
[SPEAKER_12]: What game was it promoting?

551
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:06,000
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know, but, like, Nintendo's using sex to sell, like...

552
00:34:06,593 --> 00:34:07,874
[SPEAKER_12]: What's going on here?

553
00:34:08,014 --> 00:34:09,114
[SPEAKER_12]: Wholesome Nintendo?

554
00:34:09,874 --> 00:34:11,075
[SPEAKER_12]: Putting girls in bikinis?

555
00:34:11,255 --> 00:34:13,195
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe they finally figured out that sex sells?

556
00:34:13,275 --> 00:34:13,636
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

557
00:34:13,956 --> 00:34:15,096
[SPEAKER_10]: Girls in bikinis?

558
00:34:15,456 --> 00:34:16,837
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, they're like two girls.

559
00:34:17,377 --> 00:34:18,577
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't remember what game it was.

560
00:34:18,617 --> 00:34:19,738
[SPEAKER_12]: It was a competitive game.

561
00:34:20,778 --> 00:34:22,579
[SPEAKER_12]: Because there was like four people in the room.

562
00:34:23,139 --> 00:34:23,899
[SPEAKER_12]: Damn it, I don't remember.

563
00:34:23,919 --> 00:34:24,840
[SPEAKER_09]: Gosh, you're so good at this.

564
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:25,180
[SPEAKER_09]: Smarty Pants?

565
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:26,020
[SPEAKER_12]: Shut up.

566
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:26,280
[SPEAKER_12]: What?

567
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:27,681
[SPEAKER_09]: Like Smarty Pants?

568
00:34:27,801 --> 00:34:28,141
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

569
00:34:28,741 --> 00:34:29,201
[SPEAKER_09]: No way.

570
00:34:29,281 --> 00:34:30,082
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you talking to me?

571
00:34:30,102 --> 00:34:31,002
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe it's seen it.

572
00:34:31,562 --> 00:34:32,343
[SPEAKER_12]: No, it's not seen it.

573
00:34:32,423 --> 00:34:33,403
[SPEAKER_12]: No, it was like...

574
00:34:36,383 --> 00:34:38,704
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was a game that I didn't know.

575
00:34:38,804 --> 00:34:40,866
[SPEAKER_10]: The chat is saying Smackdown vs. Raw 08.

576
00:34:40,966 --> 00:34:42,787
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, maybe that's what it was, yeah.

577
00:34:42,827 --> 00:34:44,448
[SPEAKER_10]: And they say it's the publisher, not Nintendo.

578
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:46,109
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that would be a third-party publisher.

579
00:34:46,269 --> 00:34:47,369
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, yeah.

580
00:34:47,689 --> 00:34:48,770
[SPEAKER_12]: That's like, I guess.

581
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:51,071
[SPEAKER_09]: Mario Galaxy, now with more nipples.

582
00:34:51,812 --> 00:34:53,433
[SPEAKER_09]: Hot.

583
00:34:53,713 --> 00:34:54,093
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.

584
00:34:55,574 --> 00:34:57,315
[SPEAKER_12]: You should replace the stars with boobies.

585
00:34:57,825 --> 00:34:59,648
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for watching!

586
00:35:15,384 --> 00:35:19,066
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if you've ever seen this game, the Nuts and Milk, which is a Japanese game.

587
00:35:20,807 --> 00:35:22,067
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, Nuts and Milk.

588
00:35:22,128 --> 00:35:26,270
[SPEAKER_10]: Somebody turned the game into just nuts, and you were a little wandering penis.

589
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:29,892
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, people do the stupidest stuff.

590
00:35:30,132 --> 00:35:32,173
[SPEAKER_10]: That's great.

591
00:35:32,253 --> 00:35:36,655
[SPEAKER_10]: If Irene ruled the world, even the next-gen games, you're going to collect boobies.

592
00:35:37,035 --> 00:35:38,256
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, and pandas.

593
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:39,891
[SPEAKER_11]: Mostly boobies.

594
00:35:39,991 --> 00:35:41,832
[SPEAKER_10]: Boobies and pandas, the game.

595
00:35:41,892 --> 00:35:42,212
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

596
00:35:42,653 --> 00:35:47,677
[SPEAKER_10]: So we have Loki's World of Randomness, and Rice Princess presents Boobies and Pandas.

597
00:35:48,857 --> 00:35:50,639
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it sounds like a good idea.

598
00:35:50,659 --> 00:35:51,059
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I need a game.

599
00:35:51,079 --> 00:35:52,820
[SPEAKER_10]: What about you, Rob?

600
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,381
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you make?

601
00:35:53,521 --> 00:35:53,961
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

602
00:35:54,502 --> 00:35:55,803
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll think about a game a little later.

603
00:35:57,564 --> 00:36:01,527
[SPEAKER_10]: AJ Mix in chat says, ET the Extra Testicle.

604
00:36:03,669 --> 00:36:04,189
[SPEAKER_12]: Brilliant testicle.

605
00:36:05,638 --> 00:36:06,819
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh my god, and you know what?

606
00:36:06,879 --> 00:36:10,461
[SPEAKER_12]: It could be a penis that, like, gets erect so he can get out of the pit.

607
00:36:10,902 --> 00:36:15,205
[SPEAKER_12]: Because remember how you had to, like, extend his neck to get out?

608
00:36:15,805 --> 00:36:17,486
[SPEAKER_11]: You are so stupid.

609
00:36:17,847 --> 00:36:19,128
[SPEAKER_11]: You're stupid.

610
00:36:19,148 --> 00:36:22,990
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, wait a minute, better watch some porn.

611
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:23,811
Boop!

612
00:36:24,451 --> 00:36:25,232
[SPEAKER_11]: And, like, it'll, like...

613
00:36:25,578 --> 00:36:28,940
[SPEAKER_10]: DrewNami wants to remind us about Magic Penjel, where we already did all of this.

614
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,821
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah, I remember that game.

615
00:36:31,921 --> 00:36:34,762
[SPEAKER_10]: Boy, Magic Penjel gets brought up at least once a month on this program.

616
00:36:34,822 --> 00:36:44,947
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what, we need to go back and play Graffiti Kingdom, where it's basically like a Zelda-type game, but you can draw your own characters, so you could do...

617
00:36:45,837 --> 00:36:46,618
[SPEAKER_09]: All of that stuff.

618
00:36:47,278 --> 00:36:48,439
[SPEAKER_09]: Panda Boob Man!

619
00:36:48,519 --> 00:36:51,161
[SPEAKER_11]: Boobies and pandas can actually be a reality?

620
00:36:51,221 --> 00:36:52,141
[SPEAKER_09]: It can be a reality.

621
00:36:52,261 --> 00:36:54,243
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my god, I'm so there.

622
00:36:54,463 --> 00:36:58,065
[SPEAKER_09]: Or, you can get drawn to life, which you can do the same thing, just in 2D.

623
00:36:59,046 --> 00:37:01,288
[SPEAKER_09]: You can make your enemies, you know, where it's giant pieces.

624
00:37:01,308 --> 00:37:02,729
[SPEAKER_09]: Just flat boobies and pandas.

625
00:37:04,009 --> 00:37:04,510
[SPEAKER_12]: Boring.

626
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:05,070
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow.

627
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:08,332
[SPEAKER_12]: If I wanted flat boobies, I'd go to Africa.

628
00:37:08,352 --> 00:37:09,974
[SPEAKER_12]: What?! !

629
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:17,437
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, because every time they show the National Geographic ladies with their boobies, they're like flat and long.

630
00:37:17,457 --> 00:37:18,198
[SPEAKER_10]: Not always.

631
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:19,339
[SPEAKER_10]: Most of the time.

632
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:20,960
[SPEAKER_10]: I've seen some big boobies.

633
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:21,981
[SPEAKER_10]: In National Geographic.

634
00:37:22,081 --> 00:37:24,884
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, I'm like, this conversation is not going to a happy place.

635
00:37:26,525 --> 00:37:26,946
[SPEAKER_12]: It's true.

636
00:37:27,306 --> 00:37:31,650
[SPEAKER_10]: So let's talk about toys and children's toys.

637
00:37:32,131 --> 00:37:32,411
Okay.

638
00:37:32,431 --> 00:37:32,511
Okay.

639
00:37:33,203 --> 00:37:36,125
[SPEAKER_10]: and that, you know, like all these toys have been getting recalled this year.

640
00:37:36,205 --> 00:37:38,146
[SPEAKER_10]: Like the, what was the, oh God, what was that?

641
00:37:38,166 --> 00:37:42,128
[SPEAKER_10]: The dots thing that had a date rape drug in it apparently.

642
00:37:42,509 --> 00:37:42,709
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my God.

643
00:37:42,729 --> 00:37:42,929
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no.

644
00:37:43,209 --> 00:37:46,951
[SPEAKER_10]: It was something you could use as an ingredient in creating the date rape drug.

645
00:37:46,971 --> 00:37:47,551
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, if you eat it.

646
00:37:47,571 --> 00:37:48,632
[SPEAKER_09]: No, if you eat it, it has the same effect.

647
00:37:48,652 --> 00:37:49,052
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, if you eat it.

648
00:37:49,072 --> 00:37:49,312
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.

649
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:49,893
[SPEAKER_10]: It has the same effect.

650
00:37:49,913 --> 00:37:50,473
[SPEAKER_10]: What was that called?

651
00:37:50,493 --> 00:37:51,594
[SPEAKER_10]: The dots or whatever?

652
00:37:52,674 --> 00:37:53,495
[SPEAKER_10]: We need to get a bunch of that.

653
00:37:53,515 --> 00:37:54,115
[SPEAKER_10]: What the hell was it?

654
00:37:54,195 --> 00:37:54,375
[SPEAKER_10]: Why?

655
00:37:54,415 --> 00:37:55,136
[SPEAKER_10]: You just want to eat it.

656
00:37:55,666 --> 00:37:56,307
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to eat it.

657
00:37:56,507 --> 00:37:58,048
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to make dot creations.

658
00:37:58,468 --> 00:38:00,390
[SPEAKER_09]: You want to make the cat eat it and see what happens.

659
00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:01,291
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, no, I wouldn't.

660
00:38:01,391 --> 00:38:02,952
[SPEAKER_09]: I wouldn't make sure Kitty eat that.

661
00:38:03,252 --> 00:38:03,753
[SPEAKER_09]: That's mean.

662
00:38:04,193 --> 00:38:04,533
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it is mean.

663
00:38:04,553 --> 00:38:07,255
[SPEAKER_12]: The cat would go, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma.

664
00:38:08,537 --> 00:38:11,079
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's... Aquadots.

665
00:38:11,179 --> 00:38:12,380
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Raven's Dolphin.

666
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:14,141
[SPEAKER_10]: Aquadots is what they were called.

667
00:38:14,621 --> 00:38:15,162
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, anyhow...

668
00:38:16,481 --> 00:38:31,649
[SPEAKER_10]: According to a recent article in the Los Angeles Times, apparently because of all these recalls, apparently game publishers are seeing a 19% increase in sales because I guess games are safe and they're not going to try to drug your children as you are aware.

669
00:38:31,669 --> 00:38:34,411
[SPEAKER_10]: They'll just show them pictures of murder and everything like that.

670
00:38:35,011 --> 00:38:37,012
[SPEAKER_12]: Pictures of murder, yes.

671
00:38:37,052 --> 00:38:38,393
[SPEAKER_10]: Murder!

672
00:38:38,413 --> 00:38:41,154
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you remember Manhunt 2 is murder?

673
00:38:41,755 --> 00:38:42,475
[SPEAKER_10]: Murder Sims?

674
00:38:43,616 --> 00:38:43,896
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow.

675
00:38:44,807 --> 00:38:47,008
[SPEAKER_09]: Listen, we don't need to give Manhunt 2 any more press.

676
00:38:47,068 --> 00:38:48,789
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, the game's not that good.

677
00:38:49,569 --> 00:38:58,573
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, this is coming from a quote from Jarek Johnson, who's an analyst from Capital Market, says, There's definitely money leaving the toy sector.

678
00:38:58,673 --> 00:39:03,015
[SPEAKER_10]: It's logical to assume that video games might be viewed by some parents as an alternative.

679
00:39:03,495 --> 00:39:04,716
[SPEAKER_12]: He's an analyst.

680
00:39:07,197 --> 00:39:09,237
[SPEAKER_10]: Why you gotta take this show to the toilet, Rice Princess?

681
00:39:09,798 --> 00:39:10,218
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

682
00:39:11,173 --> 00:39:11,793
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow.

683
00:39:12,054 --> 00:39:12,494
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways.

684
00:39:12,514 --> 00:39:13,474
[SPEAKER_12]: Just an impulse.

685
00:39:14,235 --> 00:39:14,835
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

686
00:39:15,755 --> 00:39:16,796
[SPEAKER_09]: This picture's naughty.

687
00:39:17,116 --> 00:39:17,496
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways.

688
00:39:18,977 --> 00:39:19,237
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

689
00:39:19,557 --> 00:39:21,538
[SPEAKER_09]: What are you doing over there on your laptop?

690
00:39:21,678 --> 00:39:23,879
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't have to announce it on the show.

691
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:26,060
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, this picture's naughty.

692
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,361
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah, that's real butter.

693
00:39:29,001 --> 00:39:30,622
[SPEAKER_09]: No, anyways.

694
00:39:31,342 --> 00:39:32,843
[SPEAKER_09]: Completely off topic here.

695
00:39:32,923 --> 00:39:34,664
[SPEAKER_09]: Space Invaders Extreme.

696
00:39:35,149 --> 00:39:38,951
[SPEAKER_09]: is being released for the Nintendo DS in Japan.

697
00:39:39,291 --> 00:39:40,792
[SPEAKER_09]: And why should I even mention this?

698
00:39:40,852 --> 00:39:43,253
[SPEAKER_09]: Because, you know, hey, it's Space Invaders and it's a remake.

699
00:39:43,733 --> 00:39:44,613
[SPEAKER_09]: It actually looks pretty cool.

700
00:39:44,693 --> 00:39:48,015
[SPEAKER_09]: It kind of incorporates music a little bit to it.

701
00:39:48,035 --> 00:39:51,717
[SPEAKER_09]: And they have a YouTube video on Joystick right now worth checking out.

702
00:39:52,097 --> 00:39:59,620
[SPEAKER_09]: And it reminds me a lot of Rez or even like Luminous a little bit.

703
00:40:00,081 --> 00:40:00,541
[SPEAKER_12]: Really?

704
00:40:00,641 --> 00:40:02,282
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's really cool looking, actually.

705
00:40:02,302 --> 00:40:02,682
[SPEAKER_09]: Hmm.

706
00:40:04,255 --> 00:40:07,316
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, if it comes out over here, I'm definitely going to have to check it out.

707
00:40:07,837 --> 00:40:11,118
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, it kind of changes a little bit of the pace at the end of the game and stuff.

708
00:40:11,138 --> 00:40:12,539
[SPEAKER_09]: They have power-ups and stuff you can get.

709
00:40:12,919 --> 00:40:17,261
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, each ship that you blow up kind of adds beats to the music and stuff.

710
00:40:17,461 --> 00:40:18,081
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's pretty cool.

711
00:40:18,441 --> 00:40:20,922
[SPEAKER_09]: It's got a little, like, trippy background and stuff, too.

712
00:40:21,122 --> 00:40:27,465
[SPEAKER_12]: Is it based on also the BPM, kind of like how they did on VibRibbon, like the speed of the stuff coming towards you?

713
00:40:27,505 --> 00:40:29,826
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know about that, but it just looks really cool, though.

714
00:40:30,266 --> 00:40:31,507
[SPEAKER_12]: That would be cool.

715
00:40:31,527 --> 00:40:31,647
[SPEAKER_12]: Mm-hmm.

716
00:40:33,788 --> 00:40:33,908
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

717
00:40:34,873 --> 00:40:35,253
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

718
00:40:36,274 --> 00:40:39,795
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, let's go ahead and move on to our mailbag segment.

719
00:40:39,815 --> 00:40:40,135
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.

720
00:40:40,175 --> 00:40:43,196
[SPEAKER_10]: Every week you guys send us emails at mailbag at orangeonstrater.com.

721
00:40:43,396 --> 00:40:45,797
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to open up the mailbag and choose a few of our favorites.

722
00:40:46,137 --> 00:40:49,639
[SPEAKER_10]: Since DarkSakura is not here this week, I will be doing the honors, whether you like it or not.

723
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:52,980
[SPEAKER_12]: I am here.

724
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:53,760
[SPEAKER_10]: Too bad.

725
00:40:56,221 --> 00:41:01,483
[SPEAKER_10]: Email number one this week comes to us from... I don't know.

726
00:41:01,503 --> 00:41:02,204
[SPEAKER_10]: They didn't sign it.

727
00:41:02,504 --> 00:41:02,604
[SPEAKER_10]: Um...

728
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:10,643
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to say this is from Richard M. Says, alright, I'm listening right now.

729
00:41:10,703 --> 00:41:12,303
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently this person is listening to the show right now.

730
00:41:12,644 --> 00:41:14,765
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm playing Halo 3 and blah blah blah.

731
00:41:14,825 --> 00:41:17,346
[SPEAKER_10]: I just wanted to say hi because I haven't listened for about four weeks.

732
00:41:17,806 --> 00:41:22,808
[SPEAKER_10]: I just got an Xbox 360 and Xbox Live and I sent a request to you two, Sky and Loki and DarkSakura.

733
00:41:23,248 --> 00:41:24,749
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's not there right now, but let her know.

734
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:27,890
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll do, but I'm sure she'll see the friends request when she logs in next.

735
00:41:28,291 --> 00:41:31,191
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm still adding most of the other OLR members, but most are pending right now.

736
00:41:31,611 --> 00:41:34,632
[SPEAKER_10]: But I would like to know which good games I should get.

737
00:41:35,052 --> 00:41:38,232
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I only have Fear, Condemned, Halo 3, and Guitar Hero 2.

738
00:41:39,012 --> 00:41:41,153
[SPEAKER_10]: Give me at least three games you guys think would be great.

739
00:41:41,473 --> 00:41:43,053
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll play anything but sports games.

740
00:41:43,293 --> 00:41:44,373
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, that wraps it up.

741
00:41:44,493 --> 00:41:45,234
[SPEAKER_10]: Until later, guys.

742
00:41:45,414 --> 00:41:45,934
[SPEAKER_10]: See ya.

743
00:41:46,014 --> 00:41:47,034
[SPEAKER_10]: Two thumbs up for you guys.

744
00:41:48,974 --> 00:41:49,614
[SPEAKER_10]: Three games.

745
00:41:49,654 --> 00:41:52,335
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, if you like Guitar Hero 2, you probably should get Guitar Hero 3.

746
00:41:54,995 --> 00:41:59,377
[SPEAKER_10]: If you like RPGs, get either Eternal Sonata or maybe Blue Dragon.

747
00:41:59,417 --> 00:42:01,938
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, try the demo first because that's getting some mixed reviews.

748
00:42:01,978 --> 00:42:03,798
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, it's kind of a hit or miss thing.

749
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:07,580
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.

750
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:12,082
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know how into shooters you are, but Bioshock's pretty awesome.

751
00:42:13,222 --> 00:42:14,502
[SPEAKER_10]: If you want to try a shooter, Bioshock.

752
00:42:14,522 --> 00:42:16,543
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, if you're playing Halo 3, I say get Bioshock.

753
00:42:17,564 --> 00:42:21,385
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you're looking for cheap shit, I would say Earth Defense Force 2017.

754
00:42:21,425 --> 00:42:21,645
[SPEAKER_09]: It's $19.99 now.

755
00:42:24,631 --> 00:42:28,414
[SPEAKER_09]: Seriously, you deserve to play that game.

756
00:42:28,474 --> 00:42:33,997
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I understand it's really cheesy and stupid, but it draws me in, and I don't know why.

757
00:42:35,658 --> 00:42:36,079
[SPEAKER_10]: Anything else?

758
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:44,684
[SPEAKER_09]: I would say also, well, these are a bit older, but even Saints Row's not bad, or Crackdown.

759
00:42:45,024 --> 00:42:45,805
[SPEAKER_09]: Crackdown I liked.

760
00:42:46,826 --> 00:42:47,126
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

761
00:42:48,327 --> 00:42:49,768
[SPEAKER_10]: Next email, shall we?

762
00:42:49,868 --> 00:42:51,529
[SPEAKER_10]: This is from Tensai Noob.

763
00:42:52,282 --> 00:42:52,782
[SPEAKER_10]: Emails us.

764
00:42:52,822 --> 00:42:55,884
[SPEAKER_10]: Dear OLR crew, I have a few comments and one request.

765
00:42:56,464 --> 00:42:58,105
[SPEAKER_10]: First of all, the necessary praise.

766
00:42:58,165 --> 00:43:04,008
[SPEAKER_10]: I continue to admire your devotion to the show and quite impressed that you managed to release such a funny, informative podcast each week.

767
00:43:04,328 --> 00:43:05,289
[SPEAKER_10]: This podcast is funny.

768
00:43:07,451 --> 00:43:14,814
[SPEAKER_09]: I always worry each week that I'm just kind of breezing over stories and just being too much of an ass and just talking randomness.

769
00:43:14,854 --> 00:43:16,215
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't even know what I'm saying half the time.

770
00:43:16,995 --> 00:43:20,737
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know how much quality I put into this.

771
00:43:20,837 --> 00:43:24,838
[SPEAKER_10]: We start to feel we're slipping a little bit, so thank you for your kind words.

772
00:43:25,479 --> 00:43:27,039
[SPEAKER_10]: It helps our egos.

773
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:30,961
[SPEAKER_10]: Now that that's out of the way, a while ago you were talking about zombie games.

774
00:43:31,061 --> 00:43:34,883
[SPEAKER_10]: Not that you don't frequently anyway, but ironic considering our game of the week.

775
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:37,701
[SPEAKER_10]: But this was an especially concentrated instance.

776
00:43:38,121 --> 00:43:42,023
[SPEAKER_10]: And you were discussing how it would be great to have a game where you are the zombie.

777
00:43:42,343 --> 00:43:45,685
[SPEAKER_10]: Have you ever heard of the game Stubs the Zombie, Rebel Without a Pulse?

778
00:43:45,745 --> 00:43:46,906
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, unfortunately I haven't.

779
00:43:46,946 --> 00:43:48,326
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a really crappy game.

780
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:52,148
[SPEAKER_10]: I tried a demo of it once, and it wasn't revolutionary, but it wasn't horrible either.

781
00:43:52,548 --> 00:43:56,350
[SPEAKER_10]: You control a zombie who can eat brains, turning the victims into zombie minions.

782
00:43:56,731 --> 00:44:00,012
[SPEAKER_10]: Take off his hand and take control of others and produce toxic farts.

783
00:44:00,512 --> 00:44:01,493
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, this game sounds classy.

784
00:44:02,569 --> 00:44:07,514
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, I thought you might appreciate knowing about a game where you actually get to be a zombie instead of always shooting them.

785
00:44:07,534 --> 00:44:09,216
[SPEAKER_10]: But you weren't a big fan of that, Loki?

786
00:44:10,297 --> 00:44:11,358
[SPEAKER_09]: It just got horrible reviews.

787
00:44:11,638 --> 00:44:13,500
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a bad, bad game.

788
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:17,444
[SPEAKER_09]: It had a funny premise to it, but... Alright.

789
00:44:18,665 --> 00:44:18,705
[SPEAKER_10]: Um...

790
00:44:19,645 --> 00:44:29,511
[SPEAKER_10]: Secondly, again referring a number of episodes back, I would like to state that Halo 3's story does make sense, but you really need to have played the previous games and maybe even have read the books to fully comprehend it.

791
00:44:30,031 --> 00:44:35,635
[SPEAKER_10]: If you need any clarification, I am perfectly willing to help clear up any confusion, as I am yet another devoted Halo fan.

792
00:44:35,695 --> 00:44:43,320
[SPEAKER_10]: On a related note, I completed Halo 3 first time through on Legendary in three days, so I can also provide any gameplay advice you may require, especially for later levels.

793
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:47,082
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, my advice I need, how do I not suck so bad at it?

794
00:44:48,302 --> 00:44:48,762
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't.

795
00:44:48,962 --> 00:44:49,743
[SPEAKER_09]: It's impossible.

796
00:44:50,763 --> 00:44:53,004
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just like I was thinking about buying Unreal Tournament 3.

797
00:44:54,745 --> 00:45:00,367
[SPEAKER_09]: For some reason I thought there was a single player mode in it, but I'm an idiot because Unreal Tournament does not have single player.

798
00:45:00,867 --> 00:45:03,688
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I mean, it does, but it's still fucking Unreal Tournament, you know?

799
00:45:04,289 --> 00:45:05,949
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like, ooh, I can make mods and stuff.

800
00:45:05,989 --> 00:45:06,870
[SPEAKER_09]: Mods are cool.

801
00:45:07,190 --> 00:45:12,592
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I'm thinking like Quake, you know, back when they had mods like Cujo and the Grappling Hook.

802
00:45:12,612 --> 00:45:14,533
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I love Cujo and the Grappling Hook.

803
00:45:15,393 --> 00:45:15,894
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, I'm weird.

804
00:45:16,194 --> 00:45:16,714
[SPEAKER_09]: But, um...

805
00:45:17,346 --> 00:45:18,387
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not going to buy that game anymore.

806
00:45:20,087 --> 00:45:23,189
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you know, also I want to say about the whole Halo 3 story thing.

807
00:45:23,209 --> 00:45:32,354
[SPEAKER_10]: I think there was a great video floating around out there that was basically Halo 1 and 2's story kind of condensed into a few minutes that was something you could watch to catch up.

808
00:45:32,414 --> 00:45:33,495
[SPEAKER_09]: I have the collector's edition.

809
00:45:33,535 --> 00:45:36,096
[SPEAKER_09]: I just haven't watched any of the videos on that second disc.

810
00:45:36,777 --> 00:45:38,878
[SPEAKER_09]: Aren't you glad you spent all that extra money?

811
00:45:38,898 --> 00:45:43,420
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, the only reason I bought the collector's edition was for the video calibration tool.

812
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:44,681
[SPEAKER_09]: That is the only reason.

813
00:45:45,163 --> 00:45:48,830
[SPEAKER_09]: and ironically enough, I have not used the video calibration tool yet.

814
00:45:48,850 --> 00:45:51,115
[SPEAKER_09]: You tool!

815
00:45:51,435 --> 00:45:51,676
[SPEAKER_10]: Ouch.

816
00:45:52,217 --> 00:45:53,760
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, moving on.

817
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:55,363
[SPEAKER_10]: Next email comes to us from...

818
00:45:57,102 --> 00:45:59,444
[SPEAKER_10]: Johnny S, because they didn't sign it.

819
00:45:59,884 --> 00:46:03,648
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember, if you don't sign your emails, I don't know what to call you, so I'll just use your first name and last initial.

820
00:46:04,508 --> 00:46:06,030
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, I have a question.

821
00:46:06,150 --> 00:46:08,432
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm thinking about buying an 80 gigabyte PlayStation 3.

822
00:46:09,092 --> 00:46:16,218
[SPEAKER_10]: I've got to have Metal Gear Solid 4 and Gran Turismo 5, but other than that, is there anything else that warrants my $600?

823
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:23,865
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe Resistance, Fallen Man, and depending on what kind of games you like, maybe Uncharted.

824
00:46:24,724 --> 00:46:29,787
[SPEAKER_09]: Ratchet & Clank, you know, my friend's been playing tons of Ratchet & Clank, and I've watched him play a little bit of it.

825
00:46:30,188 --> 00:46:31,348
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just not that impressed by it.

826
00:46:31,629 --> 00:46:36,111
[SPEAKER_09]: But then again, I didn't play any of the other Ratchet & Clank games, and I don't know.

827
00:46:36,212 --> 00:46:38,733
[SPEAKER_09]: He loves Ratchet & Clank, he loves that game, so maybe that game.

828
00:46:38,893 --> 00:46:39,914
[SPEAKER_09]: Heavenly Sword, maybe.

829
00:46:40,194 --> 00:46:41,055
[SPEAKER_10]: The Blu-ray player?

830
00:46:41,475 --> 00:46:42,576
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, Blu-ray's good.

831
00:46:42,796 --> 00:46:46,918
[SPEAKER_09]: If you like online shooter games, maybe like Warhawk might be good.

832
00:46:47,539 --> 00:46:47,639
[SPEAKER_09]: Um...

833
00:46:48,148 --> 00:46:48,748
[SPEAKER_09]: PlayStation Network

834
00:47:15,376 --> 00:47:16,557
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

835
00:47:37,978 --> 00:47:38,678
[SPEAKER_09]: and stuff like that.

836
00:47:38,978 --> 00:47:41,519
[SPEAKER_09]: Because they get a lot of demos and stuff that we don't get out over here.

837
00:47:42,459 --> 00:47:42,979
[SPEAKER_09]: So do that.

838
00:47:43,639 --> 00:47:49,561
[SPEAKER_09]: If you want to check out some of the games that are on there like Flow is pretty fun.

839
00:47:50,001 --> 00:47:51,481
[SPEAKER_09]: Everyday Shooter is supposed to be good.

840
00:47:52,662 --> 00:47:53,742
[SPEAKER_09]: Pain just came up.

841
00:47:53,922 --> 00:47:55,863
[SPEAKER_09]: That might be something I like but I don't know.

842
00:47:56,863 --> 00:48:03,644
[SPEAKER_09]: And then maybe if you're into Tekken 5 they have the Tekken 5 multiplayer online game.

843
00:48:03,724 --> 00:48:05,545
[SPEAKER_10]: And you know what game I strongly recommend?

844
00:48:08,044 --> 00:48:10,626
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god.

845
00:48:10,946 --> 00:48:13,849
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not playing that game unless I can hit the game.

846
00:48:14,970 --> 00:48:16,332
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the only way I'm playing that game.

847
00:48:16,392 --> 00:48:20,316
[SPEAKER_10]: I gotta say, despite all the smack we're talking about, the gate looks fucking gorgeous.

848
00:48:20,376 --> 00:48:21,216
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it looks awesome.

849
00:48:21,256 --> 00:48:23,118
[SPEAKER_09]: This is like a game I could just sit and look at.

850
00:48:23,899 --> 00:48:25,741
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, and you know what else I can sit and look at?

851
00:48:26,041 --> 00:48:27,763
[SPEAKER_09]: Discovery Channel HD.

852
00:48:27,923 --> 00:48:28,583
[SPEAKER_09]: And porn.

853
00:48:29,084 --> 00:48:29,645
[SPEAKER_09]: And porn.

854
00:48:29,685 --> 00:48:29,945
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't...

855
00:48:30,464 --> 00:48:32,506
[SPEAKER_12]: Just look at games.

856
00:48:32,666 --> 00:48:34,127
[SPEAKER_12]: I like to play them too.

857
00:48:34,207 --> 00:48:36,749
[SPEAKER_10]: But there are a lot of people that do like to just watch other people play games.

858
00:48:36,869 --> 00:48:40,331
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, we've got to move on and get to some more emails.

859
00:48:40,631 --> 00:48:46,135
[SPEAKER_10]: Fergatron writes us and says, I know this email is late, but I'm seriously behind my list of podcasts.

860
00:48:46,155 --> 00:48:48,137
[SPEAKER_10]: It's titled Late Entry Episode 255.

861
00:48:48,697 --> 00:48:49,558
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's a few episodes back.

862
00:48:50,228 --> 00:48:53,730
[SPEAKER_10]: Take-Two Interactive had to dish out about $2 million for this hot coffee leak.

863
00:48:53,770 --> 00:48:57,733
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm concerned about the programmer or project manager responsible for the original hot coffee feature.

864
00:48:58,133 --> 00:48:58,974
[SPEAKER_10]: What's going to happen to them?

865
00:48:59,034 --> 00:49:02,136
[SPEAKER_10]: Did they get lynched, raped, or mobbed by corporate?

866
00:49:04,378 --> 00:49:04,798
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

867
00:49:04,898 --> 00:49:05,879
[SPEAKER_10]: We never really heard about it.

868
00:49:05,919 --> 00:49:08,620
[SPEAKER_10]: But those type of internal things are company dealings.

869
00:49:08,701 --> 00:49:09,621
[SPEAKER_10]: We never know.

870
00:49:10,202 --> 00:49:10,702
[SPEAKER_10]: I imagine...

871
00:49:12,652 --> 00:49:17,795
[SPEAKER_10]: I imagine there were multiple people responsible for it, and it was probably part of the original concept as it was.

872
00:49:18,175 --> 00:49:25,619
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you think way back to when we were first talking about Hot Coffee, I think the whole problem was is that the mode was never taken out of the game.

873
00:49:26,199 --> 00:49:32,503
[SPEAKER_10]: Whatever pointed to the mode, you know, like if you think about programming, the way it works, every game is like a giant flow chart, right?

874
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:41,768
[SPEAKER_10]: So basically what they did, they took that arrow out that enables something to go to the sex mode and turn it on, and all that cheat did was put that arrow back in, basically.

875
00:49:42,769 --> 00:49:45,551
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think one person was solely responsible for that.

876
00:49:45,911 --> 00:49:49,754
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that was part of a larger screw-up, basically.

877
00:49:50,875 --> 00:49:59,561
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why the game took so freaking long to come out in its sanitized version, because they had to go back and actually take out the entire thing.

878
00:49:59,581 --> 00:50:06,626
[SPEAKER_09]: To be honest, if there's some content that's in the game that they leave in there, people will find it.

879
00:50:06,646 --> 00:50:10,549
[SPEAKER_09]: They found stuff in Zelda, like the debug levels, they found stuff

880
00:50:11,107 --> 00:50:12,188
[SPEAKER_09]: Wind Waker, of course.

881
00:50:12,888 --> 00:50:16,969
[SPEAKER_09]: They found stuff in pretty much any game that has stuff hidden in there.

882
00:50:17,270 --> 00:50:19,250
[SPEAKER_09]: Smash Brothers, hidden characters, stuff like that.

883
00:50:20,711 --> 00:50:33,276
[SPEAKER_10]: We were getting into a talk earlier about, just want to say, before I get back to the email, because now I'm looking at chat room, and we talked about porn earlier, and DMM wanted to remind us that the porn industry actually supports HD DVD, not Blu-ray.

884
00:50:33,556 --> 00:50:34,417
[SPEAKER_09]: They support both.

885
00:50:34,457 --> 00:50:36,477
[SPEAKER_09]: They support wherever people are going to buy shit.

886
00:50:36,698 --> 00:50:38,598
[SPEAKER_10]: Legend of Zaku says Blu-ray forbids porn.

887
00:50:38,638 --> 00:50:39,039
[SPEAKER_10]: Hope you know.

888
00:50:39,899 --> 00:50:40,059
[SPEAKER_09]: Hmm.

889
00:50:40,808 --> 00:50:49,211
[SPEAKER_09]: That's bullshit because I know Pirates, that porno that's pretty funny actually, high production value, is on both Blu-ray and HD DVD.

890
00:50:49,792 --> 00:50:50,192
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, snap.

891
00:50:51,212 --> 00:50:51,472
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.

892
00:50:51,492 --> 00:50:52,413
[SPEAKER_10]: What else did Furgatron say here?

893
00:50:52,613 --> 00:50:55,774
[SPEAKER_10]: Sky, you mentioned that you play a lot of WoW instead of other games.

894
00:50:56,174 --> 00:50:57,455
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm in the same situation.

895
00:50:57,515 --> 00:51:03,877
[SPEAKER_10]: I have only a limited amount of time to play games, so when it comes time to play, I end up playing whatever game I can get the most out of, which ends up being WoW.

896
00:51:04,317 --> 00:51:06,298
[SPEAKER_10]: What server do you play on and what's your character's name?

897
00:51:06,478 --> 00:51:09,940
[SPEAKER_10]: Mine is... I don't know if he wants me to read this on the air.

898
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:10,580
[SPEAKER_10]: So there you have it.

899
00:51:11,833 --> 00:51:18,539
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, if you want to find out more information about the Orange Lounge Guild that we all play on in WoW, it's all on the forums.

900
00:51:18,979 --> 00:51:20,060
[SPEAKER_10]: So check it out, forums.

901
00:51:20,601 --> 00:51:21,262
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice plug, huh?

902
00:51:21,642 --> 00:51:23,444
[SPEAKER_10]: Go to OrangeLoungeRadio.com and click on forums.

903
00:51:24,945 --> 00:51:28,649
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if my character name is posted, but if you join the guild, it won't be hard to figure out who I am.

904
00:51:30,530 --> 00:51:32,292
[SPEAKER_10]: Honestly, if you listen to the show long enough, you'll know.

905
00:51:33,893 --> 00:51:35,795
[SPEAKER_10]: The last email tonight comes to us from...

906
00:51:37,074 --> 00:51:38,015
[SPEAKER_10]: Ali, I believe it's Ali.

907
00:51:38,855 --> 00:51:42,738
[SPEAKER_10]: I was listening to episode 255 part B and you just mentioned Logo.

908
00:51:43,198 --> 00:51:45,220
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my God, I was a beast at Logo.

909
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:48,282
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember me and my one friend had a working Tetris on Logo.

910
00:51:48,582 --> 00:51:50,063
[SPEAKER_10]: You have no idea how hard that is.

911
00:51:50,423 --> 00:51:53,525
[SPEAKER_10]: However, because the language was highly inefficient, it would go wicked slow.

912
00:51:53,885 --> 00:51:56,227
[SPEAKER_10]: We had this running on a one gigahertz Celeron.

913
00:51:56,287 --> 00:51:58,028
[SPEAKER_10]: It was called Micro Worlds on those machines.

914
00:51:58,328 --> 00:51:59,930
[SPEAKER_10]: And the processor would be maxed out.

915
00:51:59,990 --> 00:52:02,491
[SPEAKER_10]: The fan would be going full tilt to play Tetris.

916
00:52:02,912 --> 00:52:03,532
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I'm a nerd.

917
00:52:03,877 --> 00:52:07,639
[SPEAKER_10]: Other than that, I remember I would make some hardcore art with logo fractals and stuff.

918
00:52:07,679 --> 00:52:08,259
[SPEAKER_10]: Good times.

919
00:52:09,439 --> 00:52:09,920
[SPEAKER_10]: Good times.

920
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:11,380
[SPEAKER_10]: I only ever had logo on the Commodore 64.

921
00:52:13,061 --> 00:52:23,485
[SPEAKER_10]: And for a reminder for those that weren't listening that week, logo is that language where you had a little turtle and you would point, you know, pen down, up 10, right 10, you know, and all that stuff.

922
00:52:23,545 --> 00:52:28,227
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was basically how people of a younger age could learn programming more easily.

923
00:52:29,307 --> 00:52:31,008
[SPEAKER_10]: Why are you giving me dirty looks, Rice Princess?

924
00:52:31,028 --> 00:52:32,929
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not giving you dirty looks, Rice Princess.

925
00:52:34,486 --> 00:52:36,127
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just pooping.

926
00:52:37,628 --> 00:52:38,668
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what it looks like.

927
00:52:39,108 --> 00:52:40,349
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, mind your own business, pal.

928
00:52:40,389 --> 00:52:41,549
[SPEAKER_10]: Try not to in the room.

929
00:52:41,569 --> 00:52:41,830
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

930
00:52:42,490 --> 00:52:45,551
[SPEAKER_10]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us some more email.

931
00:52:46,052 --> 00:52:47,732
[SPEAKER_10]: Skype line will be open very soon.

932
00:52:47,792 --> 00:52:50,534
[SPEAKER_10]: We have about three more stories for you guys before we get there, though.

933
00:52:50,694 --> 00:52:52,595
[SPEAKER_10]: So get your dialing fingers ready.

934
00:52:52,615 --> 00:52:58,357
[SPEAKER_10]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or use name on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, right after a few more news stories.

935
00:52:58,617 --> 00:52:58,978
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

936
00:52:59,198 --> 00:53:02,119
[SPEAKER_09]: Including one talking about Boom Boom Rocket.

937
00:53:02,537 --> 00:53:03,178
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

938
00:53:29,548 --> 00:53:32,329
[SPEAKER_09]: So it sounds like Rice Princess was doing earlier in the corner.

939
00:53:32,929 --> 00:53:36,370
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks like I incline rock music.

940
00:53:38,290 --> 00:53:39,731
[SPEAKER_10]: I downloaded the five new songs.

941
00:53:39,751 --> 00:53:40,231
[SPEAKER_10]: They're okay.

942
00:53:40,291 --> 00:53:48,212
[SPEAKER_10]: They are more rock influenced than Synthie, but I wasn't that impressed because they are, again, just classic remix songs.

943
00:53:48,632 --> 00:53:55,634
[SPEAKER_09]: And one other thing I was going to say, I believe that you can also use the rock band drums for this as well, if you are ever so inclined.

944
00:53:56,246 --> 00:53:57,287
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're really bored.

945
00:53:57,627 --> 00:53:58,727
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, really bored.

946
00:53:58,988 --> 00:53:59,428
[SPEAKER_09]: Really bored.

947
00:54:00,849 --> 00:54:06,251
[SPEAKER_09]: And basically, the five songs are free for right now until December 16th.

948
00:54:06,572 --> 00:54:09,433
[SPEAKER_09]: Then afterwards, it's going to set you back 250 Microsoft points.

949
00:54:09,513 --> 00:54:14,356
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you have a chance, get on live, get the update, get the free songs, play it later.

950
00:54:15,416 --> 00:54:19,118
[SPEAKER_10]: Even if you don't think you'll want to play them now, get it anyway while it's still free, right?

951
00:54:19,559 --> 00:54:21,520
[SPEAKER_09]: Free is always good.

952
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:22,560
[SPEAKER_09]: Free is good.

953
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:25,762
[SPEAKER_09]: Unless it's Yaris, in which case it's not good.

954
00:54:27,244 --> 00:54:28,845
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for watching!

955
00:54:55,367 --> 00:55:00,889
[SPEAKER_10]: But if you think about it, a lot of the principles you learn here, you could apply to a lot of different crafts.

956
00:55:00,949 --> 00:55:03,110
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, who's to say you can make a weighted companion cube out of it?

957
00:55:03,270 --> 00:55:07,132
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, is that with clay or is that like styrofoam that they're carving or something?

958
00:55:07,652 --> 00:55:12,214
[SPEAKER_10]: It says the materials in it are, I quote, Okay, so it's clay.

959
00:55:12,234 --> 00:55:13,134
[SPEAKER_10]: It's sculpted clay.

960
00:55:13,154 --> 00:55:14,274
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, sculpted clay.

961
00:55:14,294 --> 00:55:14,374
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

962
00:55:22,765 --> 00:55:23,505
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's what they use.

963
00:55:23,525 --> 00:55:30,107
[SPEAKER_10]: And you actually, I guess, make a cube out of it and then carve into it and then you bake it and then you color it, basically.

964
00:55:30,127 --> 00:55:31,148
[SPEAKER_10]: And then you feed it to your cat.

965
00:55:31,928 --> 00:55:32,848
[SPEAKER_10]: Or make your cat look at it.

966
00:55:34,889 --> 00:55:35,229
[SPEAKER_09]: Cute.

967
00:55:36,829 --> 00:55:40,510
[SPEAKER_09]: And Sculpey, if I remember correctly, because my sister makes a ton of shit out of that stuff.

968
00:55:41,251 --> 00:55:42,651
[SPEAKER_09]: She loves doing that.

969
00:55:43,371 --> 00:55:43,991
[SPEAKER_09]: You can use it.

970
00:55:44,071 --> 00:55:45,212
[SPEAKER_09]: You can fire it in your oven.

971
00:55:45,652 --> 00:55:47,753
[SPEAKER_10]: Frisbee says that needs to be my Christmas gift.

972
00:55:47,893 --> 00:55:50,693
[SPEAKER_10]: That might be actually a fun Christmas gift for people.

973
00:55:52,014 --> 00:55:52,314
[SPEAKER_12]: Fun.

974
00:55:53,322 --> 00:55:53,762
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you know.

975
00:55:53,862 --> 00:55:55,042
[SPEAKER_10]: Fantastic.

976
00:55:55,562 --> 00:55:57,663
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know about you guys, but I like homemade gifts.

977
00:55:57,703 --> 00:56:02,124
[SPEAKER_10]: I think they mean a lot more than something bought at Target on clearance.

978
00:56:02,604 --> 00:56:04,564
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, then I'll poop in a bag for you.

979
00:56:05,545 --> 00:56:06,705
[SPEAKER_12]: I can make a lot of those.

980
00:56:07,945 --> 00:56:09,045
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys are obscene.

981
00:56:09,605 --> 00:56:11,746
[SPEAKER_12]: Enough for all of my friends.

982
00:56:12,386 --> 00:56:13,446
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I know what you mean, Rob.

983
00:56:13,646 --> 00:56:14,486
[SPEAKER_12]: I like homemade stuff.

984
00:56:14,526 --> 00:56:17,027
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's make arcs and crafts together for Christmas gifts.

985
00:56:17,087 --> 00:56:17,727
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

986
00:56:18,087 --> 00:56:19,807
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to get you a coaster for Christmas.

987
00:56:19,827 --> 00:56:20,408
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't you want one of those?

988
00:56:20,428 --> 00:56:22,568
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to make candy with the aqua dots inside.

989
00:56:23,911 --> 00:56:25,133
[SPEAKER_09]: Special Rice Krispie Treats

990
00:56:43,037 --> 00:56:49,141
[SPEAKER_09]: And then another game, as I mentioned earlier, possibly going to import, Wii Fit has come out in Japan.

991
00:56:49,421 --> 00:56:52,383
[SPEAKER_09]: And of course, there are lines for it.

992
00:56:52,843 --> 00:56:56,885
[SPEAKER_09]: Lots of people looking to play this game, including there's going to be a lot of cool stuff in there.

993
00:56:56,965 --> 00:57:00,267
[SPEAKER_09]: There's yoga, which looks pretty cool.

994
00:57:00,928 --> 00:57:09,733
[SPEAKER_09]: Balance, including they have a skiing game, soccer, ski jump, some sort of like monkey ball thing, and tight rope.

995
00:57:10,236 --> 00:57:11,357
[SPEAKER_09]: and Cardio.

996
00:57:11,377 --> 00:57:13,899
[SPEAKER_09]: They have Hulu Hoop, Jogging and Dancing.

997
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:15,481
[SPEAKER_11]: Awesome.

998
00:57:15,761 --> 00:57:16,622
[SPEAKER_11]: Can't wait.

999
00:57:16,662 --> 00:57:19,084
[SPEAKER_09]: This game is fucking expensive if you import it.

1000
00:57:19,104 --> 00:57:19,805
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like $189.

1001
00:57:19,925 --> 00:57:21,346
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god.

1002
00:57:21,947 --> 00:57:22,527
[SPEAKER_09]: Why so much?

1003
00:57:22,547 --> 00:57:23,909
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that just because of the shipping and everything?

1004
00:57:24,029 --> 00:57:24,429
[SPEAKER_09]: Import.

1005
00:57:25,550 --> 00:57:27,152
[SPEAKER_09]: The import fees can't be that high.

1006
00:57:27,552 --> 00:57:28,673
[SPEAKER_10]: It's high demand.

1007
00:57:28,733 --> 00:57:29,754
[SPEAKER_10]: Christ.

1008
00:57:30,815 --> 00:57:32,016
[SPEAKER_10]: I still might get it though.

1009
00:57:32,597 --> 00:57:33,658
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my god, you're insane.

1010
00:57:33,718 --> 00:57:36,581
[SPEAKER_10]: Why can't you just wait a few months for the version to come out here in the US?

1011
00:57:36,901 --> 00:57:39,945
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I have bonus money to burn and I can do it that way.

1012
00:57:40,045 --> 00:57:40,866
[SPEAKER_10]: Give me money!

1013
00:57:41,006 --> 00:57:42,527
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll spend it on a good cause.

1014
00:57:42,547 --> 00:57:43,188
[SPEAKER_10]: I know.

1015
00:57:43,408 --> 00:57:44,209
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, you're crazy.

1016
00:57:45,791 --> 00:57:46,332
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello everyone!

1017
00:57:46,632 --> 00:57:47,032
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, who's this?

1018
00:58:13,177 --> 00:58:16,360
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Rice Princess's other BF, Ranma.

1019
00:58:16,380 --> 00:58:17,862
[SPEAKER_10]: Ah, Rice Princess's better half.

1020
00:58:18,202 --> 00:58:18,963
[SPEAKER_10]: Her other BF.

1021
00:58:19,043 --> 00:58:19,784
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, other boyfriend.

1022
00:58:20,224 --> 00:58:21,626
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, whoa.

1023
00:58:22,527 --> 00:58:23,888
[SPEAKER_10]: Competition.

1024
00:58:23,908 --> 00:58:25,149
[SPEAKER_10]: You know she poops a lot, right?

1025
00:58:26,271 --> 00:58:26,871
[SPEAKER_12]: And fart.

1026
00:58:27,372 --> 00:58:27,932
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't forget that.

1027
00:58:28,052 --> 00:58:29,254
[SPEAKER_10]: Ranma, what's on your mind?

1028
00:58:30,435 --> 00:58:31,215
[SPEAKER_05]: A couple of things.

1029
00:58:31,776 --> 00:58:36,038
[SPEAKER_05]: The first thing I want to talk about is the whole GameStop charging more money for accessories.

1030
00:58:36,838 --> 00:58:44,482
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I've seen them do this on a regular basis because when Beatmania came out, I went over to Best Buy and they had it for like, I think it was $59.

1031
00:58:45,823 --> 00:58:47,504
[SPEAKER_05]: And I went over to GameStop, they had it for $69.

1032
00:58:48,084 --> 00:58:55,768
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, normally the games are known price everywhere else, but when it comes to anything with an accessory, they're known for charging $5 to $10 more for it.

1033
00:58:57,375 --> 00:58:58,716
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why you gotta shop around.

1034
00:58:58,776 --> 00:59:00,617
[SPEAKER_05]: Do they price match there, out of curiosity?

1035
00:59:01,458 --> 00:59:03,319
[SPEAKER_05]: No, because they don't advertise.

1036
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:04,060
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what it is.

1037
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:04,841
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

1038
00:59:05,741 --> 00:59:05,921
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1039
00:59:06,242 --> 00:59:09,444
[SPEAKER_05]: Plus that they do a lot of sales with used games and stuff, they don't price match.

1040
00:59:09,924 --> 00:59:12,206
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that's why you want to do your research before you go out and buy.

1041
00:59:12,266 --> 00:59:14,768
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, sometimes GameStop may have the best deal.

1042
00:59:14,868 --> 00:59:20,212
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, you know, Final Fantasy XII had that collector's edition that was only available at GameStop, had some extra stuff with it.

1043
00:59:20,252 --> 00:59:21,713
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, sometimes it's a good place to get games.

1044
00:59:22,093 --> 00:59:23,955
[SPEAKER_10]: But sometimes you're better off going somewhere else.

1045
00:59:25,175 --> 00:59:29,938
[SPEAKER_05]: I did go to GameStop to get my collector's edition, but other than that, there wasn't going to be one.

1046
00:59:29,958 --> 00:59:32,739
[SPEAKER_05]: I would have gone to Best Buy.

1047
00:59:32,759 --> 00:59:37,602
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember when Nintendogs first came out, I ended up going to Best Buy.

1048
00:59:37,922 --> 00:59:43,985
[SPEAKER_10]: I was going to go to GameStop, but that day I found out there was a $5 gift card or something you would get if you bought it at Best Buy.

1049
00:59:45,265 --> 00:59:49,928
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why that website, CheapAssGamer, that's why that website is so insanely popular.

1050
00:59:51,175 --> 00:59:55,576
[SPEAKER_10]: Because that's like gamers getting together to share their resources about where to find the best deal.

1051
00:59:56,536 --> 00:59:56,917
[SPEAKER_10]: Seriously.

1052
00:59:57,557 --> 00:59:59,477
[SPEAKER_10]: Whoever thought of that, honestly, genius idea.

1053
00:59:59,657 --> 01:00:00,177
[SPEAKER_10]: Genius idea.

1054
01:00:00,978 --> 01:00:01,618
[SPEAKER_10]: Wish I'd thought of it.

1055
01:00:01,658 --> 01:00:02,078
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm jealous.

1056
01:00:05,619 --> 01:00:06,159
[SPEAKER_10]: Anything else?

1057
01:00:06,919 --> 01:00:12,441
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I want to talk about this whole controversy of this guy getting fired over his honest review of Kane and Lynch.

1058
01:00:12,761 --> 01:00:13,121
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, yes.

1059
01:00:13,971 --> 01:00:21,603
[SPEAKER_05]: This is going to open up into a lawsuit for wrongful termination because I think it's really fucked up that someone gets fired for their honest opinion on something, you know?

1060
01:00:22,144 --> 01:00:24,528
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, is that fair?

1061
01:00:24,568 --> 01:00:28,615
[SPEAKER_10]: But Ranma, like I said earlier in the show, we don't know for sure that's the reason yet.

1062
01:00:29,292 --> 01:00:40,335
[SPEAKER_10]: and especially in the state of California where this guy works, we have this whole law about the whole at-will employment where basically an employee can leave an organization no questions asked.

1063
01:00:40,375 --> 01:00:43,216
[SPEAKER_10]: An employer can terminate them essentially no questions asked.

1064
01:00:43,556 --> 01:00:45,796
[SPEAKER_10]: It's kind of to avoid those types of situations.

1065
01:00:46,137 --> 01:00:56,659
[SPEAKER_10]: In order for him to claim wrongful termination, it would almost have to be like they were setting him up in a way or they were like entrapping him into this or something.

1066
01:00:56,719 --> 01:00:57,740
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1067
01:00:57,800 --> 01:00:58,380
[SPEAKER_10]: It would be kind of –

1068
01:00:59,924 --> 01:01:00,925
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1069
01:01:21,112 --> 01:01:28,737
[SPEAKER_10]: At the same time, if you're a talented writer, maybe he'll decide this whole thing has him jaded from the games industry and he's going to go review movies or go write for a newspaper.

1070
01:01:28,957 --> 01:01:29,657
[SPEAKER_10]: It's really up to him.

1071
01:01:29,677 --> 01:01:31,318
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty much.

1072
01:01:31,418 --> 01:01:33,019
[SPEAKER_05]: I know there are other states that are like that.

1073
01:01:33,039 --> 01:01:41,364
[SPEAKER_05]: I know here in New York, it's not at Will State, they have to find a reason for you to be fired unless you're like during your first 30 or 90 days.

1074
01:01:42,825 --> 01:01:45,447
[SPEAKER_05]: Then they can just like, oh, fired, done, you know, whatever.

1075
01:01:45,467 --> 01:01:45,827
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1076
01:01:49,525 --> 01:01:52,906
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, Ranma, do you have any other comments or anything else you want to talk about tonight?

1077
01:01:53,527 --> 01:01:56,128
[SPEAKER_05]: Last thing and then I'll be on my merry little way.

1078
01:01:56,668 --> 01:02:02,790
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm probably one of the few people in the chatroom that's really against this whole Activision Vivendi buyout thing.

1079
01:02:03,230 --> 01:02:04,811
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just really appalled by it.

1080
01:02:05,011 --> 01:02:07,412
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you sure you're not being a little tinfoil hat-ish?

1081
01:02:08,372 --> 01:02:08,592
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

1082
01:02:09,953 --> 01:02:10,993
[SPEAKER_10]: What's so scary about it?

1083
01:02:11,834 --> 01:02:12,374
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not scary.

1084
01:02:12,394 --> 01:02:14,975
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just that Activision is like one of the last –

1085
01:02:15,754 --> 01:02:40,270
[SPEAKER_05]: long-running independent game publishers going back to the 70s they have like this long decorative career of great things that they've done and now boom they're part of some like multi-global unit it's like look at Atari for example they more like a good thing going and then Infogrames bought them renamed it to Atari and now look at them I guess that's true

1086
01:02:41,107 --> 01:02:45,489
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess maybe this is just a little bit of fear, but, you know, mergers aren't necessarily always a bad thing.

1087
01:02:45,529 --> 01:02:47,250
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, Square Enix didn't work out so bad.

1088
01:02:47,890 --> 01:02:52,672
[SPEAKER_05]: I just find the Square Enix merger funny because Square's doing more profits than Enix.

1089
01:02:52,772 --> 01:02:55,694
[SPEAKER_05]: Enix walks up, I know it, what a big thing of cash.

1090
01:02:55,714 --> 01:02:57,195
[SPEAKER_05]: You're like, hi, we're buying you.

1091
01:03:00,936 --> 01:03:01,196
[SPEAKER_10]: Hmm.

1092
01:03:02,537 --> 01:03:02,897
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1093
01:03:03,177 --> 01:03:06,879
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the thing is that this is not really like a merger per se.

1094
01:03:06,939 --> 01:03:10,841
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just that all the venue has just like a controlling stake in the company.

1095
01:03:11,325 --> 01:03:13,246
[SPEAKER_05]: They haven't said it's a merger or anything, you know?

1096
01:03:15,407 --> 01:03:19,189
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, well, we'll see if your tinfoil hat things come true or not.

1097
01:03:20,490 --> 01:03:21,170
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope not, though.

1098
01:03:22,191 --> 01:03:32,016
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not scared yet, but, you know, yeah, when we start seeing the whole, you know, the orcs and tauren showing up in Guitar Hero, then I will be a little scared.

1099
01:03:33,737 --> 01:03:33,957
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

1100
01:03:34,237 --> 01:03:35,337
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see what happens, as you said.

1101
01:03:35,577 --> 01:03:36,538
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, well, take care, Ranma.

1102
01:03:36,558 --> 01:03:37,639
[SPEAKER_10]: We gotta get some more calls.

1103
01:03:38,359 --> 01:03:38,739
[SPEAKER_10]: You got it.

1104
01:03:38,899 --> 01:03:39,239
[SPEAKER_10]: Bye-bye.

1105
01:03:39,499 --> 01:03:40,280
[SPEAKER_12]: Bye, Ranma.

1106
01:03:40,708 --> 01:03:45,533
[SPEAKER_10]: 1877-GAME-OLR is the magic number to call, or you can give us a call on our Skype line.

1107
01:03:45,993 --> 01:03:48,575
[SPEAKER_10]: Orange Lounge Radio is our username on Skype.

1108
01:03:49,256 --> 01:03:50,137
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1109
01:03:50,157 --> 01:03:50,517
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

1110
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:52,900
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Puppy.

1111
01:03:53,220 --> 01:03:54,121
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello, Puppy.

1112
01:03:54,241 --> 01:03:55,262
[SPEAKER_10]: What's on your mind, Puppy?

1113
01:03:58,985 --> 01:04:02,569
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of stuff, but mostly just a lot of rock band issues.

1114
01:04:03,249 --> 01:04:03,890
[SPEAKER_10]: What's going on?

1115
01:04:03,930 --> 01:04:04,831
[SPEAKER_10]: Did your stuff break?

1116
01:04:06,778 --> 01:04:12,101
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, my guitar got that bad strum bar problem that's been popping up with a lot of people.

1117
01:04:13,342 --> 01:04:14,862
[SPEAKER_09]: I know you can fix that yourself.

1118
01:04:16,763 --> 01:04:22,667
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but I'm not that handy with electronics, so I'd rather not risk tinkering with it.

1119
01:04:22,887 --> 01:04:24,908
[SPEAKER_09]: Or you're just lazy.

1120
01:04:25,048 --> 01:04:26,128
[SPEAKER_09]: It really isn't that hard.

1121
01:04:26,249 --> 01:04:30,711
[SPEAKER_09]: You basically unscrew the back, and what it is is the contact switch in there gets kind of,

1122
01:04:31,556 --> 01:04:36,143
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess turned, and all you have to do is just loosen the screw, line it back up, and tighten it again.

1123
01:04:36,343 --> 01:04:37,325
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you're good to go.

1124
01:04:38,867 --> 01:04:40,770
[SPEAKER_10]: That doesn't sound too hard when Loki says it.

1125
01:04:42,898 --> 01:04:44,459
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I've actually got my thumb away already, man.

1126
01:04:44,479 --> 01:04:47,801
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently, though, they actually are giving away free games, too, if you have your guitar fixed.

1127
01:04:47,821 --> 01:04:48,422
[SPEAKER_10]: You get a free game with it.

1128
01:04:48,442 --> 01:04:49,963
[SPEAKER_10]: But they haven't said what the game is yet, right?

1129
01:05:05,419 --> 01:05:18,666
[SPEAKER_08]: I read that story earlier and I think it said that people that had put their origin for replacements like a week ago and it was getting delayed because of a lack of stocks and they were getting that free game.

1130
01:05:19,006 --> 01:05:32,074
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I think I heard our old buddy Bobby Blackwolf talking about that because he's been having problems with not just the drums but now his guitar as well and they sent him an email because his drums got delayed but then they told him it was the guitar in the email so he's just all kinds of confused.

1131
01:05:32,274 --> 01:05:34,775
[SPEAKER_10]: I was listening to that on his show this week and it just kind of

1132
01:05:35,222 --> 01:05:40,646
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I've used my Guitar Hero 3 controller for my guitar My guitar actually started acting up only like 4 or 5 days after I got the system And...

1133
01:06:02,876 --> 01:06:07,220
[SPEAKER_08]: It just got progressively worse, and now it's to the point where the downstream doesn't work at all.

1134
01:06:07,421 --> 01:06:09,663
[SPEAKER_10]: So the Guitar Hero 3 controller works on Rock Band?

1135
01:06:11,384 --> 01:06:14,207
[SPEAKER_08]: My Guitar Hero 3 controller, my wireless one, does work.

1136
01:06:15,208 --> 01:06:17,670
[SPEAKER_09]: There's only the PlayStation 3 version that does not play nice.

1137
01:06:17,691 --> 01:06:19,292
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I thought that worked out.

1138
01:06:19,452 --> 01:06:22,996
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, maybe I'll get the Guitar Hero 3 controller then, because I do kind of want a wireless controller.

1139
01:06:23,016 --> 01:06:23,516
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be fun.

1140
01:06:24,017 --> 01:06:24,297
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see.

1141
01:06:24,938 --> 01:06:25,658
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, that's a lot of money.

1142
01:06:25,698 --> 01:06:31,961
[SPEAKER_08]: The wireless controller is nice, but I like the design for the Rock Band controller a lot better.

1143
01:06:32,101 --> 01:06:33,902
[SPEAKER_10]: I love the design on the Rock Band controller.

1144
01:06:34,682 --> 01:06:36,623
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a bummer that they're having all the problems they are.

1145
01:06:37,083 --> 01:06:41,024
[SPEAKER_10]: Hopefully by the time they start selling them separately next year, they can fix some of those problems.

1146
01:06:41,085 --> 01:06:41,805
[SPEAKER_10]: I really hope so.

1147
01:06:43,606 --> 01:06:47,727
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that would be nice, because having an extra controller would be good for parties and whatnot.

1148
01:06:48,608 --> 01:06:48,888
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice.

1149
01:06:49,748 --> 01:06:51,929
[SPEAKER_08]: Just that you didn't get Guitar Hero 3.

1150
01:06:53,047 --> 01:06:55,548
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure there's very few of those people out there at this point.

1151
01:06:57,749 --> 01:07:08,034
[SPEAKER_08]: Not much, other than the fact that I finished Assassin's Creed and I jumped up and screamed at the ending.

1152
01:07:09,335 --> 01:07:11,356
[SPEAKER_10]: I heard the ending is kind of shocking a lot of people.

1153
01:07:11,476 --> 01:07:12,176
[SPEAKER_10]: Very interesting.

1154
01:07:13,276 --> 01:07:14,337
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd be very curious about that.

1155
01:07:15,049 --> 01:07:17,531
[SPEAKER_08]: I wouldn't want to go into detail and spoil it, but yeah.

1156
01:07:17,551 --> 01:07:17,891
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1157
01:07:17,951 --> 01:07:18,832
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't see it coming.

1158
01:07:19,532 --> 01:07:20,433
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting.

1159
01:07:20,713 --> 01:07:23,195
[SPEAKER_10]: Isn't the ending supposedly kind of a trip, too?

1160
01:07:25,216 --> 01:07:34,302
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, the ending itself is really trippy, and the way it's kind of set up is that they basically knew ahead of time that this was going to be a trilogy.

1161
01:07:34,442 --> 01:07:36,444
[SPEAKER_10]: But the beginning is weird, too, right?

1162
01:07:37,785 --> 01:07:38,225
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah.

1163
01:07:38,305 --> 01:07:41,247
[SPEAKER_08]: When I first started, I'm like, okay, what's going on here?

1164
01:07:41,287 --> 01:07:44,029
[SPEAKER_08]: This doesn't look like a game in the Crusades.

1165
01:07:44,676 --> 01:07:46,196
[SPEAKER_10]: Hmm, interesting.

1166
01:07:46,256 --> 01:07:52,838
[SPEAKER_08]: It took me a good two or three hours into it before I started to catch the whole timeline of the game, so.

1167
01:07:52,878 --> 01:07:53,098
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1168
01:07:54,738 --> 01:07:57,519
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, well, Puppy, we've got to let you go to get more calls, but thanks so much for the call, all right?

1169
01:07:58,459 --> 01:07:58,739
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1170
01:07:59,059 --> 01:07:59,419
[SPEAKER_10]: Bye-bye.

1171
01:08:00,539 --> 01:08:08,001
[SPEAKER_10]: If you have a call you want to get through to us, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio is the username on Skype.

1172
01:08:10,101 --> 01:08:11,421
[SPEAKER_10]: Waiting for a call to drop.

1173
01:08:11,441 --> 01:08:13,402
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1174
01:08:13,422 --> 01:08:13,782
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

1175
01:08:15,199 --> 01:08:16,019
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening, guys.

1176
01:08:16,099 --> 01:08:16,779
[SPEAKER_06]: It's DMN.

1177
01:08:17,019 --> 01:08:18,240
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello, DMN.

1178
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:19,320
[SPEAKER_10]: What's on your mind, my friend?

1179
01:08:20,900 --> 01:08:23,221
[SPEAKER_06]: First of all, if you haven't bought Mass Effect, buy it.

1180
01:08:23,301 --> 01:08:24,181
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the game of the year.

1181
01:08:25,862 --> 01:08:28,563
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm waiting on Pins and Needles to check it out.

1182
01:08:28,703 --> 01:08:29,443
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm so excited.

1183
01:08:29,483 --> 01:08:31,723
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm supposed to be borrowing my friend's copy very soon, so we'll see.

1184
01:08:32,804 --> 01:08:34,824
[SPEAKER_06]: I got a free copy from my buddy at Microsoft.

1185
01:08:34,844 --> 01:08:36,265
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, that is not why I called.

1186
01:08:38,145 --> 01:08:41,646
[SPEAKER_06]: I have called because I think everybody who listens to this show...

1187
01:08:42,153 --> 01:08:49,259
[SPEAKER_06]: should thank you, Loki, DarkSakura, and everybody else who reports news on this station because we don't get paid to do a damn thing.

1188
01:08:51,181 --> 01:09:01,910
[SPEAKER_06]: The reason I say this is the story that led into the show tonight was Jeff Kurtzman getting fired from GameSpot over his review of Kane and Lynch, which was an acceptable review.

1189
01:09:02,410 --> 01:09:09,376
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody gave that review the most of seven across the board, and the fact that Eidos...

1190
01:09:11,642 --> 01:09:24,717
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's the most lowest, unobjective thing I've ever seen a media publication do.

1191
01:09:25,818 --> 01:09:30,924
[SPEAKER_10]: But again, do you think you might be filling in some gaps with hearsay, though?

1192
01:09:31,775 --> 01:09:41,039
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the only thing I'm kind of challenging here is that, you know, yes, we know Eidos pulled the ad campaign, but did they necessarily do it because of the bad review itself?

1193
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:44,621
[SPEAKER_10]: Did they maybe do it because of all this, you know, fallout that happened because of it?

1194
01:09:46,082 --> 01:09:59,188
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I mean, I was going on Eidos' forums this morning, and I saw people, you know, telling Eidos, shame on them for doing what they did, and those threads were getting locked and deleted, which means I think Eidos...

1195
01:09:59,731 --> 01:10:03,272
[SPEAKER_06]: knows a little more than they want to say about the situation.

1196
01:10:04,533 --> 01:10:07,154
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just hate the gaming companies being so intimidating.

1197
01:10:08,715 --> 01:10:11,436
[SPEAKER_06]: If I recall, we had Beautiful Katamari.

1198
01:10:12,116 --> 01:10:19,939
[SPEAKER_06]: We had an exclusive release date, and we were intimidated by Namco to pull that because, I want to say, what was it, 1UP?

1199
01:10:21,620 --> 01:10:24,721
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently bought the rights to that, which I think is retarded.

1200
01:10:26,637 --> 01:10:30,260
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think anybody should ever have to buy news.

1201
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:36,483
[SPEAKER_06]: Money should not be involved only when it's purchasing games and or the gaming review magazines.

1202
01:10:36,543 --> 01:10:42,387
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think that the companies should be in bed with the gaming review magazines ever.

1203
01:10:43,228 --> 01:10:44,889
[SPEAKER_06]: It creates bad situations like this.

1204
01:10:45,549 --> 01:10:46,890
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to blow things wide open.

1205
01:10:47,563 --> 01:10:49,364
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to make a lot of these publishers look bad.

1206
01:10:49,384 --> 01:10:50,664
[SPEAKER_06]: Eidos has lost my business.

1207
01:10:50,724 --> 01:10:52,545
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to buy Conan I, Boring Adventures.

1208
01:10:52,925 --> 01:10:55,086
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm taking my $50 and going elsewhere with that.

1209
01:10:55,286 --> 01:11:05,029
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to say, as we referenced earlier in the show, and you do definitely bring up a sore subject around these parts, but it's a fair comparison, so fine.

1210
01:11:06,030 --> 01:11:15,193
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, it just kind of goes to show you that there's a lot of shady things that go on behind the scenes, and that's why a lot of this corporate stuff

1211
01:11:15,888 --> 01:11:17,989
[SPEAKER_10]: has a very sour taste in my mouth a lot of the times.

1212
01:11:18,169 --> 01:11:33,214
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm, if anything, you know, I'm kind of very interested to see how, you know, whether it be mob mentality or not, there's going to be a lot of people that are going to open themselves up to getting the news from gamers who aren't necessarily paid to do it.

1213
01:11:33,334 --> 01:11:37,756
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just kind of, I'm very interested to see, you know, kind of where that takes us, the independent folks.

1214
01:11:38,236 --> 01:11:39,316
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1215
01:11:39,916 --> 01:11:44,678
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I would honestly say if this were to happen to Orange Lounge Radio, the same situation with an editor,

1216
01:11:46,267 --> 01:11:46,787
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

1217
01:12:07,942 --> 01:12:13,025
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess that's just kind of the difference, but we're not, you know, we don't pretend to be a money-making corporation either.

1218
01:12:13,085 --> 01:12:14,486
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe that's why we're not making money.

1219
01:12:14,686 --> 01:12:15,467
[SPEAKER_10]: That's kind of the sad thing.

1220
01:12:15,487 --> 01:12:17,428
[SPEAKER_10]: You're making tons of money, you just don't know about it.

1221
01:12:19,289 --> 01:12:19,549
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

1222
01:12:19,590 --> 01:12:20,950
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's my cut?

1223
01:12:21,251 --> 01:12:22,611
[SPEAKER_10]: I blew all of it on crack.

1224
01:12:26,394 --> 01:12:28,195
[SPEAKER_10]: DMN, anything else you want to share with the listeners?

1225
01:12:28,215 --> 01:12:29,276
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got to get some more calls, though.

1226
01:12:31,497 --> 01:12:33,178
[SPEAKER_06]: It's raining like hell in Seattle.

1227
01:12:33,198 --> 01:12:33,738
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a good night.

1228
01:12:34,179 --> 01:12:34,499
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1229
01:12:35,387 --> 01:12:37,228
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for the weather report, DMN.

1230
01:12:37,288 --> 01:12:38,188
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate it.

1231
01:12:39,908 --> 01:12:41,729
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to log you out.

1232
01:12:41,789 --> 01:12:44,710
[SPEAKER_10]: That was an even better report than the forecast channel, to be honest.

1233
01:12:44,750 --> 01:12:46,731
[SPEAKER_10]: We got more calls ringing off the hook tonight.

1234
01:12:47,071 --> 01:12:47,971
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1235
01:12:47,991 --> 01:12:48,371
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

1236
01:12:49,091 --> 01:12:49,872
[SPEAKER_00]: RavensDolphin.

1237
01:12:49,932 --> 01:12:50,972
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

1238
01:12:51,212 --> 01:12:51,432
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello.

1239
01:12:51,592 --> 01:12:52,753
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm okay.

1240
01:12:52,933 --> 01:12:53,833
[SPEAKER_10]: How are you, RavensDolphin?

1241
01:12:54,953 --> 01:12:55,573
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm okay.

1242
01:12:55,814 --> 01:12:58,334
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to shed some more light on the Gershman trial.

1243
01:12:58,474 --> 01:13:00,615
[SPEAKER_00]: Not Gershman trial, the Gershman thing.

1244
01:13:01,095 --> 01:13:02,236
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, not a trial yet.

1245
01:13:02,256 --> 01:13:02,776
[SPEAKER_10]: Who knows?

1246
01:13:04,301 --> 01:13:05,843
[SPEAKER_10]: See what this is?

1247
01:13:05,943 --> 01:13:06,984
[SPEAKER_10]: Hold on a minute, Ravens.

1248
01:13:07,024 --> 01:13:10,187
[SPEAKER_10]: See, this is exactly what happens when you play the internet game of telephone.

1249
01:13:10,227 --> 01:13:14,751
[SPEAKER_10]: Now suddenly on a blog it's going to show up, oh my god, the Gersman firing case goes to trial.

1250
01:13:15,091 --> 01:13:16,553
[SPEAKER_10]: I heard it on OLR, it's true.

1251
01:13:17,434 --> 01:13:18,354
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not true.

1252
01:13:18,414 --> 01:13:19,696
[SPEAKER_10]: Right, no one will believe that.

1253
01:13:19,836 --> 01:13:27,063
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right, no one believes the poo that falls out of our mouths every Sunday night on this program.

1254
01:13:27,283 --> 01:13:29,405
[SPEAKER_10]: If the corporate sites are to be believed.

1255
01:13:31,341 --> 01:13:33,162
[SPEAKER_10]: What's on your mind Raven's Dolphin?

1256
01:13:33,182 --> 01:13:34,303
[SPEAKER_00]: When does that particular show come out?

1257
01:13:34,343 --> 01:13:34,763
[SPEAKER_00]: Wednesday

1258
01:13:59,963 --> 01:14:02,585
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the day supposedly he was canned.

1259
01:14:02,865 --> 01:14:04,306
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's use the word allegedly.

1260
01:14:04,346 --> 01:14:05,747
[SPEAKER_10]: That makes it sound professional.

1261
01:14:05,967 --> 01:14:10,791
[SPEAKER_10]: Allegedly Wednesday was the day he was locked out of the office and his boxes were thrown out on the curb.

1262
01:14:12,852 --> 01:14:14,593
[SPEAKER_00]: That just sounds wrong.

1263
01:14:15,154 --> 01:14:20,998
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to feel like I'm going to feel dumb if this happens when he goes like, well, it wasn't over Kane and Lynch or he had some...

1264
01:14:21,667 --> 01:14:24,749
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the gaming community would owe these guys one hell of an apology if that came to light.

1265
01:14:24,769 --> 01:14:25,309
[SPEAKER_00]: Never gonna happen.

1266
01:14:25,349 --> 01:14:25,750
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know.

1267
01:14:50,789 --> 01:14:53,610
[SPEAKER_10]: DMN wants to know, did the podcasters over on GameSpot sound morose?

1268
01:14:54,130 --> 01:14:57,971
[SPEAKER_00]: DMN wants to know, did the podcasters over on GameSpot sound morose?

1269
01:15:21,380 --> 01:15:21,981
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura.com

1270
01:15:40,564 --> 01:15:41,105
[SPEAKER_10]: Is she a lawyer?

1271
01:15:41,505 --> 01:15:42,265
[SPEAKER_10]: No, she is.

1272
01:15:42,385 --> 01:15:43,066
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course she is.

1273
01:15:43,126 --> 01:15:43,386
[SPEAKER_10]: Come on.

1274
01:15:43,426 --> 01:15:44,607
[SPEAKER_10]: We would never do that.

1275
01:15:44,947 --> 01:15:45,808
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, it's just funny.

1276
01:15:46,428 --> 01:15:48,470
[SPEAKER_10]: She's being buried in there now.

1277
01:15:49,270 --> 01:15:49,771
[SPEAKER_10]: Never.

1278
01:15:50,331 --> 01:15:54,194
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm surprised she hasn't called in, but she's probably sleeping if she flew back tonight.

1279
01:15:54,234 --> 01:15:59,958
[SPEAKER_10]: But anyway, yeah, it's a lot of answers to come next week.

1280
01:16:00,599 --> 01:16:02,680
[SPEAKER_10]: I think this is going to be one of the hot coffees of 2007.

1281
01:16:05,022 --> 01:16:07,664
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we're going to see this pop up again before we know it.

1282
01:16:08,547 --> 01:16:21,159
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell you this, as a person that likes GameSpot, and I'm the person that, I always go to GameSpot for my things, I always reference to them, and this is kind of just, I just can't just go there anymore and trust them anymore.

1283
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:33,330
[SPEAKER_00]: I respect them, I respect Jeff for giving an honest review of the game, even though that it got pulled, we don't know until Tuesday, so I respect him for that, and I hope he gets a better job.

1284
01:16:33,928 --> 01:16:42,800
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I gotta say, GameSpot was one of my more... If I was going to go look at corpse sites, it was probably one of the ones I...

1285
01:16:44,808 --> 01:16:46,570
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought it was better written.

1286
01:16:46,830 --> 01:16:47,611
[SPEAKER_10]: It had a pretty good written.

1287
01:16:47,631 --> 01:16:50,875
[SPEAKER_10]: It was very professional in a lot of the stuff I read.

1288
01:16:51,235 --> 01:16:56,941
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of the corpse sites feel a little unprofessional to me, but that particular one felt professional in some of the things.

1289
01:16:56,961 --> 01:17:05,870
[SPEAKER_10]: Because obviously when we were in the news a lot because of Beautiful Katamari and the Konami thing, we saw what some of these sites were writing about us, and I thought GameSpot was probably the most fair.

1290
01:17:07,092 --> 01:17:10,634
[SPEAKER_00]: They put it in the rumor control instead of the other.

1291
01:17:11,414 --> 01:17:12,294
[SPEAKER_00]: They mention your name.

1292
01:17:12,374 --> 01:17:12,975
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the thing.

1293
01:17:13,875 --> 01:17:14,275
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.

1294
01:17:15,416 --> 01:17:15,616
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1295
01:17:15,656 --> 01:17:17,757
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, Raven Stolfen, any other quick thoughts?

1296
01:17:17,817 --> 01:17:19,257
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm echoing, so we've got to let you go here.

1297
01:17:19,317 --> 01:17:19,838
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I'm sorry.

1298
01:17:19,998 --> 01:17:20,218
[SPEAKER_10]: Bye.

1299
01:17:20,678 --> 01:17:20,978
[SPEAKER_10]: Bye-bye.

1300
01:17:22,759 --> 01:17:23,059
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1301
01:17:23,439 --> 01:17:26,180
[SPEAKER_10]: If you want to give us a call, we'll take a couple more calls.

1302
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:28,481
[SPEAKER_10]: 877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.

1303
01:17:28,841 --> 01:17:29,842
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1304
01:17:29,862 --> 01:17:30,182
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

1305
01:17:31,323 --> 01:17:31,583
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, guys.

1306
01:17:31,603 --> 01:17:31,823
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up?

1307
01:17:31,843 --> 01:17:32,603
[SPEAKER_10]: This is Footy Monster.

1308
01:17:32,683 --> 01:17:33,503
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello, Footy Monster.

1309
01:17:33,563 --> 01:17:34,564
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, Footy Monster.

1310
01:17:35,092 --> 01:17:41,416
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, a little special hello from Rice Princess over there.

1311
01:17:41,456 --> 01:17:43,857
[SPEAKER_10]: I like your avatar on Skype, by the way.

1312
01:17:43,897 --> 01:17:45,678
[SPEAKER_10]: It's some girl with big boobies.

1313
01:17:47,839 --> 01:17:48,920
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, boobs are the win.

1314
01:17:49,880 --> 01:17:54,403
[SPEAKER_10]: I think this is going to star in Rice Princess' upcoming game, Boobies and Pandas.

1315
01:17:55,884 --> 01:17:58,265
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, what's on your mind, Footy?

1316
01:17:59,405 --> 01:18:01,487
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, of course, it has to be this whole thing with games, right?

1317
01:18:01,507 --> 01:18:01,627
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1318
01:18:02,930 --> 01:18:03,971
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's two things.

1319
01:18:04,291 --> 01:18:09,756
[SPEAKER_01]: First off, when people are actually looking for reviews, they don't go to one place alone.

1320
01:18:09,877 --> 01:18:18,945
[SPEAKER_01]: They go to all of the places, and they make an evaluation, a general consensus of what they think they want to think of the game after they read all the reviews, not just one review.

1321
01:18:19,619 --> 01:18:20,139
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1322
01:18:46,849 --> 01:18:51,970
[SPEAKER_01]: and not because of what was written, because I'm sure that what he wrote is the same thing that everybody else wrote.

1323
01:18:53,871 --> 01:19:04,013
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem with that is that not only were they an advertiser, but also the number didn't fit with the PR department, which is usually the problem with everything in this gaming industry that we're in.

1324
01:19:04,193 --> 01:19:11,535
[SPEAKER_01]: So, like, you know, we're making this sound like, oh, you know, whatever, this is a huge deal, but in truth, it happens every day.

1325
01:19:11,755 --> 01:19:13,936
[SPEAKER_01]: It just so happens that this guy, you know,

1326
01:19:14,855 --> 01:19:16,596
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

1327
01:19:43,556 --> 01:20:01,180
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone did comment on the joystick story that they wrote on this thing, and apparently it's someone from inside GameSpot, and the guys actually said how the process went, and apparently the management in GameSpot changed, and now it's just a bunch of suits, and apparently this kind of thing is going to keep happening in GameSpot.

1328
01:20:02,714 --> 01:20:05,817
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I don't know, but after this huge backlash, money rules everything.

1329
01:20:05,837 --> 01:20:15,965
[SPEAKER_10]: And if it's true that people are canceling their accounts not just by the hundreds but by the thousands, then there are board of directors that are over those suits, and those suits will be out very soon.

1330
01:20:18,988 --> 01:20:19,808
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you sure about that?

1331
01:20:19,928 --> 01:20:21,930
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean the thing is that suits are there for a reason.

1332
01:20:21,990 --> 01:20:23,531
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the reason why they bring them in.

1333
01:20:23,551 --> 01:20:25,433
[SPEAKER_10]: Money changes everything.

1334
01:20:25,553 --> 01:20:26,634
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember that old song?

1335
01:20:26,734 --> 01:20:28,896
[SPEAKER_10]: If it's true that people are canceling their accounts –

1336
01:20:29,318 --> 01:20:32,579
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't want to see games go under, I don't, but already they lost credibility.

1337
01:20:54,375 --> 01:20:55,516
[SPEAKER_01]: and not the editors.

1338
01:20:55,756 --> 01:20:59,279
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the editors themselves, if they go somewhere else, they're going to have the credibility back.

1339
01:20:59,940 --> 01:21:09,648
[SPEAKER_01]: But if they go, if they stay there like scaredy cats and you will never know if their writing is their honest opinion or something that they're doing just because they don't want to lose their jobs.

1340
01:21:09,668 --> 01:21:11,310
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I was going to say, they may not have a choice.

1341
01:21:11,330 --> 01:21:12,671
[SPEAKER_10]: They may have families and stuff.

1342
01:21:12,951 --> 01:21:15,333
[SPEAKER_10]: The job market is not that easy sometimes.

1343
01:21:15,994 --> 01:21:16,214
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1344
01:21:16,815 --> 01:21:18,396
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I mean, trust me, I understand that.

1345
01:21:18,456 --> 01:21:28,659
[SPEAKER_01]: But the thing is like we as gamers and as consumers who are about to spend whatever money, okay, not me because I pirate everything, but people who actually pay for stuff, you know, like they want to know what they're paying for.

1346
01:21:28,959 --> 01:21:35,341
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not fair for them to buy crap because you don't know if they're lying to you when they're supposed to be telling you the objective truth.

1347
01:21:35,361 --> 01:21:40,523
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I mean, for some reason, there's a reason why it's journalism, you know.

1348
01:21:40,922 --> 01:21:45,767
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a niche, but it's journalism, a kind of journalism.

1349
01:21:45,827 --> 01:21:47,428
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're supposed to be objective.

1350
01:21:47,768 --> 01:21:55,255
[SPEAKER_01]: And if money's in the way, I forgot who was the caller that said that, but if money's in the way, then forget it.

1351
01:21:55,976 --> 01:22:05,685
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole thing gets screwed, and the only way we're looking at it is everything's going to be Game of the Year material because we never know who's going to be paying for the paycheck at the end of the month.

1352
01:22:06,566 --> 01:22:06,846
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1353
01:22:08,463 --> 01:22:10,764
[SPEAKER_10]: One more thing, then we've got to wrap up and let you go.

1354
01:22:11,185 --> 01:22:11,805
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm looking here.

1355
01:22:13,265 --> 01:22:21,029
[SPEAKER_10]: Dr3ev, or whatever this guy's name is in chat, who I can't pronounce his name, I'm sorry, says, FootyMonster takes payola for RPG reviews.

1356
01:22:21,209 --> 01:22:22,189
[SPEAKER_10]: Are these accusations true?

1357
01:22:23,630 --> 01:22:24,330
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish they were.

1358
01:22:24,350 --> 01:22:30,212
[SPEAKER_01]: Trust me, the minute it happens, I'm buying myself a 360.

1359
01:22:31,493 --> 01:22:32,093
[SPEAKER_01]: Just know it.

1360
01:22:32,933 --> 01:22:33,934
[SPEAKER_01]: No, so far, no.

1361
01:22:34,334 --> 01:22:36,615
[SPEAKER_01]: About that, guys, you need to check out The Witcher.

1362
01:22:37,071 --> 01:22:37,692
[SPEAKER_01]: Such a good game.

1363
01:22:39,193 --> 01:22:40,614
[SPEAKER_01]: What system is this on?

1364
01:22:41,054 --> 01:22:41,515
[SPEAKER_10]: It's PC.

1365
01:22:41,895 --> 01:22:42,095
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

1366
01:22:42,455 --> 01:22:43,096
[SPEAKER_10]: It's PC only?

1367
01:22:43,116 --> 01:22:44,837
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's PC only.

1368
01:22:44,877 --> 01:22:46,659
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I don't have a great setup.

1369
01:22:46,719 --> 01:22:48,981
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a really crappy video card, like a 60-bug video card.

1370
01:22:49,021 --> 01:22:53,484
[SPEAKER_01]: It works exceptionally good in medium detail, but it's such a fun game.

1371
01:22:53,704 --> 01:22:57,568
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, obligatory plug, check for the review on The Ultimate Quest.

1372
01:22:57,828 --> 01:22:58,288
[SPEAKER_10]: What's it called?

1373
01:22:58,308 --> 01:22:58,849
[SPEAKER_10]: The Witcher?

1374
01:23:00,170 --> 01:23:00,970
[SPEAKER_01]: The Witcher, yeah.

1375
01:23:01,010 --> 01:23:04,693
[SPEAKER_01]: It's based on some Polish guy's books, and it's actually pretty good.

1376
01:23:04,873 --> 01:23:05,574
[SPEAKER_10]: You've heard of this, Loki?

1377
01:23:06,680 --> 01:23:07,681
[SPEAKER_10]: It sounds like a scary game.

1378
01:23:08,102 --> 01:23:08,963
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I guess.

1379
01:23:09,564 --> 01:23:09,944
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting.

1380
01:23:10,024 --> 01:23:10,905
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, I'll check it out, footy.

1381
01:23:11,846 --> 01:23:14,329
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a scary game at all, but it has sex, which is good.

1382
01:23:14,549 --> 01:23:15,690
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, sex is great.

1383
01:23:16,091 --> 01:23:16,451
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm there.

1384
01:23:17,192 --> 01:23:18,293
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, footy, we've got to let you go.

1385
01:23:18,714 --> 01:23:19,114
[SPEAKER_10]: Take care, buddy.

1386
01:23:19,134 --> 01:23:19,795
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, take care, guys.

1387
01:23:20,255 --> 01:23:20,696
[SPEAKER_10]: Bye-bye.

1388
01:23:20,716 --> 01:23:21,597
[SPEAKER_12]: Bye, footy.

1389
01:23:21,697 --> 01:23:21,797
Bye.

1390
01:23:24,927 --> 01:23:28,549
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's going to do it for calls tonight, because we're looking at two long segments tonight.

1391
01:23:28,589 --> 01:23:32,312
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess doing a short show last week has made this show very large this week.

1392
01:23:32,832 --> 01:23:38,536
[SPEAKER_10]: So we've got to go around and start getting everybody's final thoughts, but not before we get some last-minute stories.

1393
01:23:39,476 --> 01:23:42,158
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, do you have any last-minute stories for us tonight, by chance?

1394
01:23:43,819 --> 01:23:44,039
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

1395
01:23:44,579 --> 01:23:46,000
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow, that's a first.

1396
01:23:46,080 --> 01:23:46,701
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a slow week.

1397
01:23:47,967 --> 01:23:56,332
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I mean, there's been a couple huge bombshells, like, of course, the GameSpot thing and everything, and the Activision Vivendi thing, but then, yeah, the rest of it's been kind of a quiet week.

1398
01:23:56,952 --> 01:23:58,733
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, American Idol 2 for February.

1399
01:23:59,894 --> 01:23:59,994
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh.

1400
01:24:01,254 --> 01:24:01,514
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?

1401
01:24:01,714 --> 01:24:04,896
[SPEAKER_09]: PlayStation 3, 360 Wii, PlayStation 2.

1402
01:24:05,477 --> 01:24:05,617
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh.

1403
01:24:05,817 --> 01:24:06,097
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe.

1404
01:24:06,397 --> 01:24:08,598
[SPEAKER_09]: Karaoke Revolution.

1405
01:24:08,838 --> 01:24:09,359
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting.

1406
01:24:09,539 --> 01:24:13,601
[SPEAKER_10]: That's very interesting considering Harmonix and Konami aren't in bed together anymore, are they?

1407
01:24:14,922 --> 01:24:15,302
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1408
01:24:15,882 --> 01:24:17,283
[SPEAKER_09]: I could still make it, though, without them.

1409
01:24:17,608 --> 01:24:17,948
[SPEAKER_10]: I just pooped.

1410
01:24:17,968 --> 01:24:18,409
[SPEAKER_10]: You're welcome.

1411
01:24:18,509 --> 01:24:19,850
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah, and Disney Channel Mix.

1412
01:24:44,485 --> 01:24:45,426
[SPEAKER_09]: When's that coming out?

1413
01:24:45,606 --> 01:24:45,986
[SPEAKER_09]: January.

1414
01:24:46,286 --> 01:24:46,386
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh.

1415
01:24:46,947 --> 01:24:47,247
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1416
01:24:47,907 --> 01:24:48,428
[SPEAKER_10]: If at all.

1417
01:24:48,668 --> 01:24:49,928
[SPEAKER_10]: It keeps getting delayed.

1418
01:24:50,429 --> 01:24:50,709
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1419
01:24:50,769 --> 01:24:53,171
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

1420
01:24:53,231 --> 01:24:57,413
[SPEAKER_10]: Rice Princess, thanks so much for being here tonight, even if you didn't contribute much besides your poop jokes.

1421
01:24:58,074 --> 01:24:58,614
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'm just kidding.

1422
01:24:58,654 --> 01:25:00,015
[SPEAKER_10]: We always appreciate having you here.

1423
01:25:00,395 --> 01:25:00,855
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1424
01:25:01,116 --> 01:25:01,676
[SPEAKER_10]: You're welcome.

1425
01:25:02,176 --> 01:25:03,557
[SPEAKER_10]: Any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

1426
01:25:03,797 --> 01:25:04,037
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

1427
01:25:05,358 --> 01:25:05,859
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, then.

1428
01:25:07,409 --> 01:25:08,970
[SPEAKER_10]: You contribute so much to this program.

1429
01:25:09,050 --> 01:25:10,091
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate it.

1430
01:25:10,572 --> 01:25:13,094
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, any final thoughts from you?

1431
01:25:13,254 --> 01:25:14,595
[SPEAKER_09]: I just have a lot of games to play this week.

1432
01:25:14,735 --> 01:25:15,876
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably won't get to most of them.

1433
01:25:17,798 --> 01:25:28,086
[SPEAKER_10]: My final thought is I need to charge my iPod so I can listen to lots of podcasts tomorrow at work because I'm writing tomorrow so I want to be able to listen to podcasts and music.

1434
01:25:29,207 --> 01:25:29,908
[SPEAKER_12]: Good idea.

1435
01:25:29,948 --> 01:25:30,788
[SPEAKER_10]: That sounds good to me.

1436
01:25:31,689 --> 01:25:32,730
[SPEAKER_09]: I need a new job.

1437
01:25:35,256 --> 01:25:37,237
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope your employers don't listen to this program.

1438
01:25:37,377 --> 01:25:38,477
[SPEAKER_09]: They do, whatever.

1439
01:25:39,137 --> 01:25:42,718
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think my manager knows how to operate a podcast anyways, to be honest.

1440
01:25:43,018 --> 01:25:45,299
[SPEAKER_09]: I know I have coworkers that listen to this show sometimes.

1441
01:25:45,799 --> 01:25:46,279
[SPEAKER_09]: They like it.

1442
01:25:47,139 --> 01:25:49,280
[SPEAKER_09]: No, but seriously, though, I mean, I need a new job.

1443
01:25:50,160 --> 01:25:51,060
[SPEAKER_09]: This doesn't pay enough.

1444
01:25:51,660 --> 01:25:57,222
[SPEAKER_09]: The problem is, though, in the area that we're at, like, since we don't live in the Bay Area, you know, there's not, like, game companies all over Sacramento.

1445
01:25:57,242 --> 01:25:59,343
[SPEAKER_09]: The Bay Area is a highly competitive job market, too.

1446
01:25:59,423 --> 01:25:59,763
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1447
01:25:59,823 --> 01:26:01,863
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, I hear there's a couple job openings at GameSpot.

1448
01:26:03,024 --> 01:26:04,204
[SPEAKER_09]: That's in the Bay Area, though.

1449
01:26:04,264 --> 01:26:04,664
[SPEAKER_09]: See, you know,

1450
01:26:05,479 --> 01:26:06,399
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to be an editor.

1451
01:26:06,419 --> 01:26:07,440
[SPEAKER_09]: You could take the train over there.

1452
01:26:07,460 --> 01:26:08,120
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't write.

1453
01:26:08,140 --> 01:26:10,801
[SPEAKER_10]: I can hardly see.

1454
01:26:10,821 --> 01:26:12,981
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you imagine Loki's game reviews on GameSpot?

1455
01:26:13,261 --> 01:26:14,602
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my god, this game sucks!

1456
01:26:14,882 --> 01:26:16,002
[SPEAKER_10]: There wasn't enough boobs!

1457
01:26:16,182 --> 01:26:32,787
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I would be objective, but you know, I just honestly, when we're talking about games during our Game of the Week and stuff like that, I can't go into an in-depth review about stuff, because honestly, I don't play a lot of stuff, and I don't have the free time to

1458
01:26:33,565 --> 01:26:35,366
[SPEAKER_09]: Review a game every week or something like that.

1459
01:26:35,446 --> 01:26:37,527
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't have enough time to play anything.

1460
01:26:37,547 --> 01:26:39,488
[SPEAKER_10]: You barely have enough time to do this damn show.

1461
01:26:40,168 --> 01:26:40,468
[SPEAKER_10]: I do.

1462
01:26:40,808 --> 01:26:42,429
[SPEAKER_09]: I barely have enough time to do this damn show.

1463
01:26:43,029 --> 01:26:47,771
[SPEAKER_09]: I would love to do a review show.

1464
01:26:48,432 --> 01:26:51,313
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the things I'm planning on doing with my...

1465
01:26:51,934 --> 01:26:52,174
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.

1466
01:26:52,194 --> 01:26:52,435
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.

[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1469
01:27:12,702 --> 01:27:18,567
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, anyhow, I guess we'll see what the future holds in 2008 for Loki and, you know, all the rest of us here at Orange Lounge Radio.

1472
01:27:25,272 --> 01:27:31,597
[SPEAKER_10]: If you like what you heard, please tell two friends about our station because then when everybody tells two people, slowly we take over the world.

1476
01:27:41,715 --> 01:27:45,396
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be fair as well because we need some more five-star reviews on iTunes.
