14106	23998	Tonight, December 2nd, 2007, the Wii gets DS demo downloads, Sony swaps out their ad agency, and Dimix comes to Xbox in the next update.
32153	36876	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36956	43301	We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle.
43641	52107	For those of you out there who have recently turned to independent radio this week in light of recent events, a warm welcome from all of us here at OLR.
52287	53628	My name is Rob Roberts.
54025	55006	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
77378	81940	We are joined tonight by the lovely Rice Princess filling in tonight.
82421	82801	Hello.
83301	87843	So it's not just the Rob and Loki show, because otherwise... It'd be pretty fucking boring.
87943	89324	It might be pretty fucking boring.
89344	90945	You put two nerds together and stuff.
90965	92145	So we brought in a third nerd.
92265	92766	So hello, Rice Princess.
92786	94086	And then it becomes great.
94186	96127	Like, three nerds makes it better.
96387	97588	I think there was a sitcom, wasn't there?
97608	99849	Like, three nerds, three mics in a pizza place?
99969	100249	I don't know.
100569	100810	Anyhow...
103008	109094	I hate that the cam is down this week, and I'll talk more about that later, because Irene has the greatest nerdy shirt in the world.
109895	111196	Is this something you got from Hot Gothic?
111456	112037	Yeah.
112057	113358	Okay, it's a Metroid shirt.
113378	115120	It's basically the box art from Metroid.
115500	115960	And what does it say?
116000	117162	Can you defeat the Mother Brain?
117202	118202	Or no, beat the Mother Brain.
118403	118623	Mm-hmm.
119003	119524	Beat the Mother Brain.
119784	122186	But you bought me a shirt too from Hot Topic, right?
122306	122947	I did.
123027	123907	I'm so excited.
123927	124868	I love presents.
124888	125489	So I'm going to open it.
125529	126550	I haven't actually opened it yet.
126590	127911	So I'm opening it here live on air.
128351	129892	Really sucks that the cam's down this week.
130032	133215	I know, but it's not gaming related at all.
133275	134356	It's not gaming related at all.
134376	135777	Shit, I didn't take the tag off.
136017	136598	That's okay.
136658	138059	I'll pretend I didn't see the tag.
138179	139540	Yeah, you should do that.
140201	141282	Oh my God, what is it?
143686	144747	Hey, that's awesome!
144787	146629	It's a Pee Wee Herman shirt.
146709	148511	It's cherry.
149252	152555	No, you should turn it over to the front, because that's the back, I'm sure.
152635	153576	Oh, Pee Wee's Playhouse.
153636	154297	Oh, that's awesome.
156616	158977	I was looking at the back that had PeeWee on Cherry.
159057	159978	You're like, wow.
160058	160598	I love you, PeeWee.
160618	162199	This is so exciting.
162539	163240	It's awesome.
163280	164420	I love PeeWee's Playhouse.
164620	165701	I'm glad you do.
165721	166041	It's great.
166161	168322	Because otherwise I'd be a pretty shitty present.
168703	172044	Otherwise it's like, here's a shirt of a show you don't like.
172105	173745	I just thought you needed new clothes, Rob.
173885	174526	That's great.
174666	176507	I will definitely wear that next week.
176527	178048	Hopefully the cam's back next week.
178448	180629	What happened to the cam, BTW?
180909	182110	I'll talk more about that in a little bit.
182786	184768	But let's start it off with how was your gaming week?
185308	187109	Loki, why don't you start us off tonight, how was your gaming week?
187609	204440	I didn't play as much as I thought I would be playing this week, but mainly my week was filled with Phantom Hourglass And it's fun, it's a normal Zelda game, don't really know what more you'd want Sorry, can I interject here for a minute?
204800	207682	I'm looking at our chat room, which I neglected to introduce, sorry chat
208001	210222	Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com We love the chat room.
210242	211362	They always crack us up.
211682	215463	And you know how just a little bit ago I was saying, what, three nerds, a mic, whatever.
216063	218203	DJ Janai comments, where's the cup?
221224	221384	Mm-hmm.
221824	222084	Funny.
222224	222504	Get it?
222825	223025	Yeah.
223345	223885	All right, anyway.
224585	224825	Sorry.
225285	225405	Ew.
226845	227826	Delayed reaction.
228566	230166	Yeah, totally didn't get it.
230466	234907	You were the one that kept, like, asking me, like, all week long, have you seen the two girls, one cup thing yet?
235768	237248	I did not ask you.
238860	240540	That's perverted and gross.
242041	244421	Anyway, sorry, Loki.
245142	248462	Anyways, so yeah, I've been playing Phantom Hourglass and it's fun.
249082	251283	So, what else did I play?
251643	260965	I tried the Wii version of the Golden Compass because Nelly wanted me to demonstrate the game for her since she's really into Golden Compass and that's who I got the game for.
261185	263506	So, it's okay.
263566	264306	It's pretty easy.
265306	267807	But I guess it's based off a video game, obviously.
268186	270168	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,
288735	292558	As if, you know, a wolf versus a polar bear was gonna win in the first place.
292578	294579	This bear is fucking tricked out with armor.
294980	296661	There's no fucking way it's gonna win.
296761	302925	Okay, but like, look at Final Fantasy XI, where like, you could fight a bunny, and the bunny rapes you for 500 points of damage.
303025	305707	I mean, it's... sometimes video games don't make sense.
305967	311211	Well, I haven't fought any bunnies yet, but as far as the wolves go, I get the crap out of them.
312176	313477	Over and over and over again.
313677	317920	I don't know, you make the Golden Compass sound pretty awesome when you're talking about polar bears and sets of armor.
318020	319681	Oh, no, you don't even know.
319882	331710	I haven't read the book or seen the movie yet, but apparently the characters in this story have their souls outside of their body as an animal, and the animal, like, talks in the same voice as the girl in the game.
332170	337514	So it's confusing because it sounds like the girl's having conversations with herself, and it's like...
338342	338882	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
364136	366678	I did play Super Mario Galaxy, though, because I was sick this week.
366938	367518	What did you think of it?
367958	369819	Well, I'm still playing it, and it's fun.
369939	373482	It's very, very, very much like Mario 64.
373962	375062	I mean, same kind of setup.
375423	376783	Just, you know, no red coins.
379045	381987	Other than that, I don't know.
382127	385188	This is pretty much it, I think, from Saints Row.
385208	387870	And, yeah.
389019	390600	What's so funny about Saints Row?
390740	393302	No, just like you're playing Saints Row.
393402	394803	Oh, and Earth Defense Force 2017.
395403	395844	Of course.
396024	396884	Still playing some of that.
397245	397545	Of course.
397565	404550	We went and tried to beat the second to last level on Inferno, and that's like getting raped by thousands of ants at the same time.
405030	405850	It's not very fun.
406271	406471	Nice.
408272	409233	Let's see, My Gaming Week...
410325	439749	I didn't play a whole lot of new stuff unfortunately I've just been very busy I've been watching my roommate play a hell of a lot of Puzzle Quest though on Xbox Live Arcade which is kind of funny because he doesn't get into a lot of video games but when he does he definitely puts he's committed so he's been very committed to Puzzle Quest he's already at level 20 he's gotten way further in the game than I have that's kind of funny yeah so he's enjoying that and other than that I've just been playing the regular World of Warcraft and Final Fantasy XI you know because I just love my MMOs
441215	441536	I know.
441916	442937	I've been playing Rock Band.
443197	449463	I went online with Rock Band this week, and I gotta say, I'm just pissed off that you can't do band co-op mode.
449904	451806	I mean, why did they leave that out?
451866	453527	Because you can do band competitive.
453547	464018	Well, it's not even really competitive, but you can do the one song stuff online, like one song at a time, but you can't do the world tour mode online, which seems kind of stupid, because it's not like
464605	467166	The Game's Unable to let four people play online at once.
467506	475250	That was kind of like one of the reasons I was excited about Rock Band is I kind of thought you were going to be able to make these bands together with people from far away.
475691	479953	Like, you know, Shane, who hasn't been on the show in a long time because he lives in Kansas, also bought the game.
479973	482194	And I was thinking, oh, we could have a band and we'd play together.
482214	482754	It would be fun.
483014	484695	But we do have a band already.
486336	490098	A rock band, not a real band where, you know, I play kazoo and...
491047	501393	I was just pissed that co-op mode was kind of missing in that regard.
501894	505416	Otherwise, they did have a David Bowie pack come out this week, and that was pretty awesome.
505656	506176	Oh, really?
506196	507497	Because David Bowie is very awesome.
507557	508358	He is.
508678	508818	Yes.
508838	510199	There's like a cover of Heroes.
510319	510679	It's good.
510939	511300	Good times.
511600	512520	Nice.
512560	513141	That's really it.
513221	514562	Not a lot else of note.
514602	515842	Not a lot of new games this week.
515922	518344	Oh, I did play Undertow, but...
518965	520045	I don't know, just not my kind of game.
520065	520765	I wasn't feeling it.
520905	531808	I tried to... It was hard to... I mean, it wasn't hard to figure it out or figure the game out, but I thought the tutorial could have been a little better because there were so many different little features in this strategy game.
531828	541350	I forgot to mention it last week, and it hasn't really been on any of the websites yet, but they released the Pay the Unlock content for Katamari.
541630	541950	Oh, yeah?
541990	542710	We Love Katamari.
543210	544910	Or not We Love Katamari, Beautiful Katamari.
545610	548191	And so I bought that, and then afterwards I'm like,
548740	549800	Why did I buy that?
551241	552101	That's a good question.
552141	552841	Why did you buy that?
553401	554321	It was an impulse buy.
554341	556662	I bought one of those $20 cards.
556962	557682	Oh my god.
557902	558323	1600 point cards.
558823	560703	Well, I didn't buy it per se.
560723	564804	I got crap that I didn't want and I traded it for a free card.
564924	565324	I gotcha.
565785	575207	So, I can thank a PS3 copy of Assassin's Creed that bought me Rock Band songs and beautiful Katamari download content.
576565	580589	Um, Sephiroth1215 on our chatroom says, Rock Band World Tour wouldn't work online.
581170	581510	Why not?
581990	582431	I don't get it.
582711	583072	It should.
583812	590639	I mean, yeah, you can't hear, I mean, I see Black Lab talking about the vocals in the game, how you don't actually hear the people singing, although you kind of do.
591079	596845	Like, if you play, but you can have a full band in the, um, play one song at a time mode co-op.
596925	599347	I don't know what it is, just quick play or whatever it's called.
599908	600028	Um,
600600	602001	And, you know, you can have a guitar.
602041	609846	And I actually signed on Xbox Live and got a random band thrown together where some guy was on vocals, I was on guitar, somebody else was on bass, and somebody else was on drums.
610546	612647	And we could hear the vocalist singing.
612688	619492	It was just a little bit faint and very, very lagged because it was transmitting through his headset or whatever while he was, you know, singing.
619792	620973	I fucking hate that shit.
621073	623514	Yeah, but the game itself doesn't support that.
623674	626336	Like, it plays the normal backtrack because of the lag.
626436	627297	Hey, that'd be kind of cool.
627317	629518	You can do the vocal parts without people hearing you.
629858	630658	I like that idea.
631839	634460	Yeah, if you just turn your headset off, you can do it without people hearing you.
634681	637962	They don't hear you.
638402	641564	Loki has a secret desire to sing a little more often, doesn't he?
641584	642024	No, I don't.
642745	643065	I don't.
643265	643745	I really don't.
644185	645906	I have a secret desire to get achievement points.
646006	649028	All right.
649708	653690	Rice Princess, have you been playing anything this week at all?
653850	654971	Just WoW, really.
655331	655751	Wow.
655831	656772	How's WoW been going for you?
657110	658030	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
687233	691136	Yeah, because, I don't know, WoW's been kind of boring for the past couple months, but now it's not.
691156	692617	It's because our guild's too small.
692737	693278	It's kind of sad.
693298	694439	Now we have, like, no tanks.
694719	695920	We can't run instances together.
695940	696620	We have no tanks.
696941	708690	That's kind of what I think brought me back to playing is that, like, I don't know, some people were running me through instances, and I ran people through instances, and, like, we have a guild bank now, and I'm totally into that.
708750	709610	Guild banks are awesome.
710571	711872	And, I don't know, it just became fun again.
711992	713133	Well, good.
713333	713513	Yeah.
713994	714254	All righty.
715089	718915	All right, well, let's get into some housekeeping tonight, and then we'll get into the gaming news.
719015	722621	Obviously, DarkSakura is not here tonight, but she will be back next week.
723317	724137	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
747699	748379	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
769964	772885	and I used the Zapper and we played Link's Crossbow Training.
772905	778207	And the funny thing that happened is that in the practice round that we played, I fucking wasted Loki.
778307	780267	Like, my score was ten times his score.
780307	781008	It was crazy.
781048	782148	Like, I just obliterated him.
782528	784089	But it was a practice round.
784469	787550	And then when we did it for reals, Loki beat me by a thousand points.
787590	788290	I was so mad.
788390	794012	So Loki won the Great Zapper Challenge, proving that the Zapper does nothing to enhance the gameplay.
794052	797193	And honestly, you playing the Zapper, it was crap, wasn't it?
797673	798333	It wasn't that great.
799640	801922	I can't say the experience was any better.
803083	805585	But the crossbow training game was kind of fun, actually.
805825	810749	To be devil's advocate and a little bit fair here, from what I hear, Ghost Squad, it's really good.
811089	820777	And the reason why is because they have a good calibration system on it where you aim down the zapper at one corner of the screen, aim down the zapper at the other corner of the screen, and then spot on after that.
820917	821258	Oh, good.
821338	827923	So, I don't know why every game for the Wii doesn't have something like that in the first place.
828023	828624	Really shouldn't have.
828644	828804	I mean...
829617	832862	That should be fucking a default thing to have in there.
832902	833603	I mean, come on.
834183	839891	But yeah, so if they add something like that to all the games, they'll be good.
840211	842474	That's one good thing that Ghost Squad has going for it.
842514	843756	And hopefully they'll have the same thing.
844016	847081	I assume they'll have the same thing in House of the Dead 2 and 3.
847952	853693	Yeah, so, I mean, the whole thing is only, what, $25 for the Zapper and Crossbow Training?
853713	857334	It's technically $20, but GameStop is ripping everyone off by $5.
857374	859894	They're overcharging over retail for it.
859914	862214	Okay, so the Wii Mode itself and Link's Crossbow Training is only $20?
862274	866615	Well, yeah, the Wii Zapper and the Link's Crossbow Training is only $20 retail.
866635	868155	That's not bad, all things considered.
868236	869396	That really isn't a bad deal.
869456	873076	I mean, granted, the game is probably worth a little more money than... And the game is short.
873176	876697	I mean, it's something you're going to beat pretty quickly, but I think it's... You know, it's a...
877521	884964	We Sports-ish kind of thing where the game doesn't have a lot of depth, but you're going to have a lot of people that want to just kind of pick it up and play it and have fun with it.
885144	887125	Because it's not like the game was that difficult to figure out.
887986	888166	Yeah.
889206	891147	I thought it was kind of fun.
891407	892948	But that sucks that Loki won the bet.
893028	897530	So no date for me and Loki gets... Is the wife going to let me take her out or what?
897710	898150	I don't know.
898370	899611	I'll have to talk about that this week.
900011	900631	I think that happened.
901051	902172	So you can have your night of peace.
902772	902972	Yeah.
904850	911813	Anyways, I was going to say for next week, because I have a whole bunch of games on queue to play.
912233	914634	A bunch of import stuff.
914714	917636	Dragon Quest Swords for the Wii.
918056	919036	Harvest Moon for the Wii.
919176	920637	Why the fuck am I going to play Harvest Moon?
920677	925159	I fucking hate Harvest Moon, but I'm going to try it anyways on the Wii for the hell of it.
928140	932022	Devil Kings 2 for the Wii, which I hear is really fucking good.
932928	934228	I'm going to try that out.
934368	940610	And then DDR Haas Party for the Wii, the Japanese version, because they have a few different songs that I want to try out.
941570	947892	And I'm going to do the All Controller Controller Revolution because it does support the classic controller to do that, which I didn't know.
947912	949572	I was like, oh, okay.
950112	952953	I'll do it that way because I don't want to buy a dance bed.
953933	956074	And then I'm trying to think what else I had.
956614	960335	Cruisin', probably one of the worst racing games out there.
961309	965731	by, you know, screenshots at least, so I'm going to play it to see how crappy it is.
966171	975634	Then another game that I know is going to be even worse, which is Offroad Extreme Special Edition, is what it's called, and it's another piece of shit that's coming out there.
976115	978055	I'll play them so you don't have to.
978075	979336	Hey, you know what, though?
980151	981352	Crappy games can be good.
981492	988379	In fact, I saw today they have the box shots for the Simple Series 3 and 4 coming out for the Wii in Japan.
988659	989560	Oh, Simple Series 1.
989820	993064	I'm also going to be playing Mita de Kart Race, another kart racing game.
994085	994945	Lots of stuff for next week.
995106	996307	When do we get the WiiWare?
996667	997508	Is that ever going to come out?
997548	999270	I thought that was supposed to come out this year.
999750	1002713	Oh, and when I get paid this week, I'm going to import Wii Fit.
1004212	1004352	WeFit
1022729	1031074	DJ Janai talking about the Wii says, I noticed that Nintendo released a game on Virtual Console that Compile made, so maybe it's possible for Nintendo to release The Guardian Legend.
1031454	1032374	God, I only hope so.
1032395	1037978	Those who have been listening to Orange Lounge Radio for any length of time know that we have a very soft spot in our hearts for the 8-bit classic The Guardian Legend.
1038018	1041580	So the day that comes out on the Wii, I'm calling in sick to work.
1043641	1043941	Let's see.
1044784	1047945	Odd1 says, the damn system will tell you six ways from Sunday.
1048405	1055268	Don't kill people with your Wiimote and go out once in a while, you fat fuck, on every game, but they don't think to help us calibrate the things to play the game better.
1057809	1059369	I love that new warning screen they have.
1059389	1061290	That thing looks like a fucking condom on there.
1061330	1061910	I'm sorry.
1063051	1065431	It is the ugliest thing.
1065551	1066012	You know what?
1066132	1068192	I'm playing fucking dangerously, okay?
1068553	1072494	I don't use the wrist strap, and even if I did, I have the original wrist strap.
1073260	1073981	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1090822	1094484	Uh, oh, Dillinger's been playing a game I really want to play, Trauma Center New Blood.
1095004	1095925	I need to go out and get that game.
1096005	1099407	Oh, yes you do, so I can take it from you and play it.
1099427	1099907	No!
1100027	1100527	Yes!
1100588	1101208	My game!
1101248	1102168	You can't take my game!
1102589	1103169	No, yeah, I can.
1103249	1106371	Do you want to borrow something else on Wii, like Metroid or something?
1106411	1106711	I don't know.
1107071	1108532	No, not fucking Metroid.
1109113	1110574	You're sure it says Metroid on it?
1110654	1113035	It says old school Metroid, dammit!
1113455	1117758	I don't want to play no damn 3D Metroid, that blasphemous piece of crap.
1118704	1119685	I mean, Metroid's great.
1119805	1122827	AZHP says Trauma Center New Blood is the best game ever.
1123308	1123768	Shut up!
1124188	1126610	I mean, that's okay that you said that, but I want to play it.
1126870	1128511	All right.
1128932	1130193	I guess that's it for housekeeping.
1130233	1137198	I don't have a lot else to add, so let's get into some... Oh, actually, one quick thing is that there's like a 90% chance next week, I know I've been saying this for a while now,
1137748	1142050	We'll finally be out in the actual studio for those keeping track.
1142150	1145611	We've been in our temporary studio, quote unquote, for like the past three months.
1146171	1152973	But I'm hoping next week, just due to some things that are going around in the personal life, we're going to try and get out there next week.
1153013	1155574	I'm very excited about it, which is why I really want the cam to come back.
1156034	1161857	So if Op 11 is not back next week, we're probably going to look into either Justin TV or Ustream.
1162337	1163137	I really haven't.
1164352	1166414	Thought about what else is a good service.
1166434	1168815	Because I kind of liked how Op 11 had the episodic stuff.
1168895	1171257	But anyhow, let's get into gaming news.
1171377	1171637	Loki.
1171938	1181745	Anyways, the thing that everybody's been talking about this week is a certain GameStop editor was rumored to have been fired for a negative review over Kane and Lynch.
1183146	1190692	Anyways, the person responsible for this... God, I can't remember his name.
1191012	1192233	They just have his last name up here.
1192553	1192833	Anyways...
1194605	1197286	and I don't even know how to pronounce that, Gerstmann, I guess?
1197827	1200548	I want to say it was like a... It was Jeff, I think it was his first name.
1200568	1201549	Jeff Gerstmann, yes.
1202229	1223580	Anyways, so the rumor is, because no one's coming out to say otherwise, the rumor is because of his negative review on Kane and Lynch, Eidos threatened to pull the ad support, because they have the whole fucking site skinned like Kane and Lynch, and because of that, since the ads pay their salaries, basically,
1224301	1228504	Rather than lose them as an ad supporter, they fired him instead.
1230666	1237292	And everybody is just up in arms because now people have finally figured out, hey, guess what?
1237332	1245138	Maybe contributions from publishers and stuff affect scores of games.
1245498	1245939	Really?
1246439	1247039	You think?
1247980	1248661	You're kidding.
1248781	1250462	Wow, welcome to the real world, folks.
1252244	1253845	Anyway, so yeah, tons of stuff.
1254491	1256092	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1273218	1274919	This guy is... Okay, I'll lie.
1275059	1278081	I've totally known about this guy and followed his career for a long, long time.
1278481	1279102	Is that a good lie?
1279542	1279622	No.
1279662	1280683	Okay, here's the truth.
1281324	1285166	I had no idea who the hell this guy was until I read this article on the internet.
1285186	1299037	Apparently, he's been some respected game journalist for the past 10 years, but honestly, I don't read a lot of corporate sites, so I don't... There's a lot of independent blogs I read, and maybe some of them are somewhat corporate, because I read Joystick, they're AOL...
1299757	1328332	Kotaku is whatever but I don't really read a lot of the big box sites very often I used to read one up maybe like three years ago I don't really read them a lot anymore either so I had no idea who the hell this guy was nevertheless I can't help but think so I'm trying to look at this like objectively as possible because I can't help but think and this may not be the popular opinion but I actually think there's a bit of mob mentality going on here I don't I think that the gaming scene is jumping to like a lot of conclusions with this stuff when
1329091	1333152	There's a lot of people that really can't talk about what's going on in this situation.
1333212	1338553	And I think there's been quite a bit of jumping to conclusions and things that have probably gotten blown out of proportions.
1339454	1344755	The interesting thing about it, I mean, honestly, these companies involved are kind of screwed because of it.
1345255	1347136	And it's kind of alarming.
1347176	1355818	I think if anything, from this, what we're learning is that the video game scene can be very sensationalist sometimes.
1356650	1359131	This isn't the first time this stuff's happened.
1359231	1360071	Not really, no.
1360291	1367312	First off, people give him crap anyways because he had that non-10 review on Twilight Princess.
1367892	1371313	Listen, if I were to review Twilight Princess, it wouldn't fucking get a 10, okay?
1371873	1375194	Seriously, that game is not God's gift to fucking gaming.
1375274	1377314	Seriously, it's just a fucking Zelda game.
1377614	1382255	Just like Phantom Hourglass is a fucking Zelda game, they're good, but they're never great, okay?
1383276	1384797	I digress, but whatever.
1384937	1385358	Anyways.
1385718	1386939	Everybody's allowed to have their own opinion.
1386959	1391982	I'm just saying, you know, everybody was fucking, like, giving Zelda a fucking blowjob or some shit like that.
1392423	1394084	It is goddamn just a game.
1394764	1395104	Anyways.
1395145	1396946	I don't know, it kind of deserved at least a handjob.
1397006	1398187	I mean, it was a really good game.
1398207	1399327	Oh, absolutely, yeah.
1399888	1402289	It was not that great of a game, seriously.
1402670	1403570	Wind Waker is a better game.
1404391	1406132	Whoa, that's crossing the line.
1406172	1407973	Whoa, wow, yeah, no, you did not just go there.
1408794	1409334	Ouch.
1409354	1409995	Back on topic.
1410175	1410415	Anyways.
1411411	1413152	I mean, does anyone remember Driver 3?
1413812	1418194	How the whole story came out that Atari was paying for good reviews on that game?
1418474	1419855	I mean, this isn't the first time.
1419895	1421555	This isn't the last time this is going to happen.
1421816	1425017	I'm sure it's happened hundreds of times between those.
1425557	1428058	So, I'm not surprised.
1428078	1432300	It's just people are finally figuring it out that this is going on behind the scenes.
1433573	1437475	And to be honest, people don't really know why this guy was let go.
1437555	1438315	I mean, think about it.
1438355	1442897	Just hypothetically, the company, and again, I don't know shit about what's going on in this situation.
1442917	1445058	I'm not going to pretend like I know what's going on in this situation.
1445098	1447960	I just know what I'm reading out there on the internet, what people are saying.
1448700	1454783	And hypothetically, in the corporate world, they could have fired this guy because he was late to work too many times.
1454883	1455063	Yep.
1455783	1456183	Who knows?
1456203	1458764	Okay, well, does it confirm that he was fired?
1459245	1459985	He did not quit?
1460379	1464542	He was basically locked out of his office.
1466443	1475229	Again, that's all talk, but you feel like there is some validity to that because obviously employees of the company are stepping forward anonymously and saying these things.
1476470	1476970	He was fired.
1478031	1479192	He'd been at the company for like 10 years.
1480367	1488089	But anyhow, you know, I've seen people in the corporate world work at a company for like 10, 15 years and get fired over a really bad thing or whatever goes on.
1488149	1488649	So who knows?
1488969	1492550	This guy could have been like late to work for an entire month or something.
1493110	1494311	Again, I'm being very hypothetical.
1494851	1498992	And the company could fire him, but the company can't say why they fired him.
1499708	1504692	and if he gets fired over something like that, is he going to say, oh yeah, they fired me because I was late to work too many times?
1505593	1507654	Or is he going to let people draw their own conclusions?
1507874	1515080	He probably also can't... Well, I'm not even really saying that... I think he can't actually say why he was fired.
1515580	1517782	I think he has to sign something when he's leaving.
1518222	1522966	This is why, you know, you're not allowed to say... Okay, so he has to sign something or what?
1524327	1527870	It's probably actually something he signed when he was... Confidentiality agreements he signed when he...
1529358	1531679	Oh, sign this.
1531719	1534121	You can't tell anyone why you're fired if we fire you.
1534461	1535462	Yeah, it's just...
1554258	1554998	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1569053	1577820	They wanted to change wording in the review to make it more accurate as to whatever the changes were between the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 were.
1578620	1580182	And he didn't want to do that.
1580862	1585566	And he got let go for being somewhat of a difficult person on this and other issues in the past.
1586226	1592671	And that, you know, because the wording got changed, the internet changed that into, you know, the great game of internet telephone, blah blah
1593760	1599847	That got changed into, oh my gosh, he refused to change the article to give it a good score, so Eidos made them fire him.
1600288	1604152	Okay, so why didn't they just not publish the review?
1604372	1608958	Why didn't they just say, hey, okay, well, this is not in line with what we're looking for?
1609619	1610619	We're not going to publish it.
1611040	1616562	I mean, I know he could just as easily go to his own personal blog and post it or whatever, but that's his own personal blog.
1616602	1617423	They don't have jurisdiction.
1617443	1622025	The thing is, though, is they use a lot of these reviews as advertising for their game as well.
1622065	1627347	I mean, that's why you see on boxes, you know, GameSpot gave it a 5 out of 5 or 10 out of 10 or whatever.
1627367	1630809	You know, they use that shit in the fucking commercials.
1630849	1635191	They use it in, you know, their press advertisements and all that stuff.
1636311	1637752	It's a big deal for them if...
1638701	1651494	They're paying GameSpot a million dollars for advertising or something like that and then all of a sudden they get a shitty ass review out of it and it causes people not to buy the game.
1651814	1657480	What's going to incentivize them to give them more money when they can give it to some other site that's going to give it a more favorable review?
1657920	1659422	Yeah, but if they don't publish it...
1660211	1665313	From that particular journalist, can't they just get one of their other journalists to publish a positive review?
1665333	1674297	Yeah, but then it's going to come out that this guy had wrote a review on it, and then all of a sudden, oh, wait a second, they didn't print it because this one's more favorable.
1674457	1676298	It would come out one way or another.
1677518	1681740	I just think that's a little far to be going, like, oh, we're going to fire you because you gave a bad review.
1681780	1686862	And also because they have deadlines when these reviews need to get out there, and they may not have time to
1687685	1688305	and DarkSakura.com.
1719535	1722318	Raven's Dolphin says, I heard he got fired of the video review.
1722398	1724760	Well, maybe, but again, this is all hearsay.
1726501	1730305	GZDr4ev says, people canceled their GameSpot accounts.
1730325	1732667	Yeah, people are leaving the site in mass over this whole thing.
1732687	1738112	But again, I partially blame mob mentality for why that's happening because people don't really know what's going on yet.
1738432	1741515	But people are making up stories that sure seem to make a lot of sense.
1742739	1746320	Frisbee says, but if the game sucks, then the players will get the truth out there.
1746440	1746940	Absolutely.
1747220	1749780	Which I think just goes to show the lesson learned here.
1749881	1757922	If you are getting all your gaming news and reviews from one person on one corporate gaming site, you might need to take off the blinders.
1760363	1764504	If you're looking for accurate reviews on stuff, don't rely on one website.
1764524	1766444	You can go to websites like Metacritic.
1767385	1772746	They've got a compilation of scores from all sorts of sites and stuff.
1773086	1776467	And that'll give you a good baseline of what the game is.
1776867	1780308	And also you can read each review and see what it is.
1780628	1781348	Wait a minute.
1781428	1784589	Did Metacritic pay you money for that, Loki?
1784909	1785849	For that endorsement?
1785949	1789309	I just happened to use that site because it compiles reviews.
1789890	1790290	Anyways.
1790350	1790750	FIRED!
1792150	1793750	I don't get paid for shit, okay?
1793790	1795191	Seriously.
1796231	1796931	Yeah, you're right about that.
1797683	1807490	The truth be told, we actually, because at work we sell Kane and Lynch and stuff, and Kane and Lynch is one of those titles that was kind of a what we call select title.
1807510	1811253	It's a title we push because we're getting paid money to push the title a little bit.
1811973	1820219	The thing is, though, Eidos set our goal so high it was impossible to hit anyways, so that it wouldn't have to pay out any money to us.
1820900	1824262	You know, because the people that make these deals are fucking retarded or something.
1824702	1825123	Anyways...
1826538	1829720	IDOS was really pushing to make this game big.
1831060	1832961	Doing it in little ways I probably wouldn't.
1833502	1835103	They're advertising and marketing people.
1835823	1840665	Little creative ways like teaming up with Playboy, for example, to do that model search.
1841606	1845768	They had interviews with the fake characters in the game in Playboy.
1846448	1848990	They did reach out to the independent media.
1849010	1851751	They flew a bunch of them out there to San Francisco to go.
1852355	1855879	We weren't invited, and we could just drive there, but that's okay, we're not bitter.
1855939	1861165	Oh yeah, sure, you know, because we drive there, you know, that's why they don't invite us or stuff.
1861906	1862366	Bastards.
1862767	1864649	Anyways, you know, and...
1865205	1870666	But I also think there's definitely a certain type of audience I think this show caters to.
1870706	1880529	I mean, granted, I think we have people from all walks of gaming that listen to this program, but I think people know that we are mostly the one you want to hear for the music, the RPGs.
1880789	1884950	There's a certain niche that Kane and Lynch doesn't fit into, I think.
1884990	1886750	I'm not saying Kane and Lynch is a bad game.
1886790	1887871	It probably could have been a good game.
1888311	1888951	I've never played it.
1889031	1889351	I don't know.
1889371	1893532	I haven't played it either, but just from what I've ever been reading and the way it looks...
1894170	1902134	To me, this game's kind of fallen into the same problem that Blacksite Area 51 and some of these other games have gotten in.
1902254	1905435	They're rushed to make it out for Christmas.
1905895	1912858	And this year, I think also next year, you're going to see a lot of these games that are going to be spread out throughout the year instead of all in November.
1913018	1914659	And that might help some of these games.
1915480	1919982	Because like Army of Two, for example, that one was going to be released in...
1921730	1924152	November as well, along with Kane Lynch and all this other stuff.
1924412	1925253	But it wasn't done yet.
1925473	1931858	And so instead of releasing it, they're putting more time into polishing it and making sure that it's a good game before they release it.
1932219	1933540	And so now it's coming out later on.
1933740	1936762	It missed the holiday thing, but it's going to be a better game.
1936922	1942487	Same with Grand Theft Auto 4, Metal Gear Solid 4, stuff like that.
1943528	1951194	Take the extra time and make the game good, and then that way you will get a better score for it instead of rushing this piece of shit out and then having to be broken.
1953784	1957506	Here's the other thing that kind of makes me think there's more than meets the eye with this whole thing.
1957966	1960428	Is a 6 out of 10 a bad review?
1961228	1965851	I mean, I realize the way the scale has been kind of skewed over the years by many people, I guess yes.
1966251	1970634	But I always thought a 5 was average, like right in the middle, you're average.
1970674	1971614	So a 5 is average.
1971634	1977038	So technically a score of 6 is a slightly above average game, right?
1977458	1977758	True.
1977778	1977858	True.
1978163	1981785	and it wouldn't be that bad if it were in a month that was a bit slower with games.
1981845	1991192	But this is November where you have 60 billion releases coming out and a sixth game may not be played by as many people as say... But here's what you need to do, though.
1991512	1999297	If you're unsure if the game's going to be good... I'm also just trying to take a jab at the fact that most games in this day and age are rated on a scale of 5 to 10, not a scale of 1 to 10.
1999337	1999957	7 to 10.
2001899	2005921	No, but seriously, though, if you're unsure the game's going to be good, rent it.
2006582	2006802	I mean...
2007461	2012204	rent it from Gamefly, rent it from your local Blockbuster, Hollywood, whoever.
2013425	2014826	Rent it and see if it's any good.
2015327	2017548	Shadowslyer wants to give insight on that.
2017628	2020610	He says, on the GameSpot scale, a 6.0 is fair.
2022051	2023292	Fair is not a bad word.
2023352	2024353	It's not a good word either.
2024413	2025694	It's just a fair word.
2026454	2028916	There really is no better description.
2029861	2037949	See, I don't even really like scale-based reviews in the first place, because then you just put all your trust, you're like, having them make the decision for you.
2038209	2041092	Like Loki said, just rent the game if you're so unsure about it.
2041413	2047239	I mean, if it catches your eye in the first place, read the review, then go rent it, but if not, then I wouldn't even worry about it.
2047299	2047459	Like,
2047759	2048620	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
2068959	2078483	I mean, god, it's not like this was reviewed by a panel of, like, scientists or something like that, you know, where they had, you know, thousands of people playing this game, and this is the score they came up with.
2078563	2095411	It's one dude, whether he likes the game or not, he may just hate Eidos or something, they may have rubbed him the wrong way before, and now he's embittered, and now it's a six or something, because they fucking pissed him off, or like, you know, if I reviewed Madden or something like that, I don't like fucking football games, one, or something like that.
2095451	2096311	I mean, that's the kind of
2096732	2101935	You're supposed to be unbiased when you're playing this stuff, but, you know, it's... I'm actually kind of curious.
2101955	2114742	What do you think about the fact that, you know, after all this, the competitors down the street at 1UP did this little protest or something on their lunch, this whole, like, kind of, you know, having the signs, Free Jeff, and whatever all that stuff was.
2114762	2115402	What do you think of that?
2115522	2116763	Because I certainly have an opinion on it.
2117665	2118546	Thank you for watching!
2135695	2136577	Thanks for watching!
2151278	2153219	Praise us for doing some good.
2153659	2154980	Fuck that.
2155340	2160842	You know, other people, if they noticed it or something like that and posted it in their fucking Flickr blogs, then it would be good.
2160902	2164123	But the fact that they're promoting themselves, look at what we did.
2164143	2165104	We're so awesome.
2165304	2165904	No, fuck that.
2165924	2166524	Wow.
2168866	2170227	Oh, we're going to get some angry emails this week.
2170267	2173368	Mailbag at OrangeHunter.com Here's the thing.
2173448	2176309	I don't know what the motivation is, whatever.
2176429	2177429	I'm not going to pretend to know.
2177469	2186453	But I do think it was a little premature because, again, I find that a little strange that they would jump in on that mob mentality when none of us truly know what's going on.
2187233	2189354	Shouldn't they have waited until more news came out?
2189634	2191654	I mean, these guys do represent a corporation.
2191815	2195716	So that's my only, like, I don't know if that was smart type of thing.
2196141	2199224	Wait, so it was a bunch of employees from 1UP?
2199584	2202087	I think that the reviewers and critics over there.
2202687	2203869	Yeah, Zip Davis or whatever.
2203929	2206071	Oh yeah, something like that.
2206231	2209494	I mean, you can't control what somebody, that's right, they can do whatever the hell they want.
2210075	2213398	But here's the thing though, what were they protesting?
2213438	2217101	That they support independent reviews or unbiased reviews or something like that?
2217502	2220645	So what they're basically saying is that they support that so that
2221723	2223484	OneUp has unbiased reviews.
2223564	2225905	That's the impression that you're supposed to get from that.
2226005	2229266	It's just fucking advertising for themselves is all it is.
2229686	2232567	And I'm sorry, I don't see it as very genuine at all.
2232727	2240370	All I see that is is, hey, some manager came up with an idea to have them go out during their lunch break and fucking protest in front of them.
2241210	2246012	No, I don't believe this shit that they're such a tight-knit group or whatever that they would do that kind of crap.
2247027	2248251	Hold on, hold on.
2248512	2251241	The few times we have been to these media events and things like that,
2252023	2253344	It's always the same fucking people.
2253964	2257265	So I think in some regard they are somewhat of a family.
2257445	2259266	Okay, let's say that they're a tight-knit group.
2259706	2268950	If I fucking got fired, say that we were corporate or whatever, and I got fired because I wrote a bad review on Kane and Lynch, would fucking one-up be on my lawn protesting for that shit?
2269211	2274953	No, they would be there twiddling their thumbs in their office going, those fuckers that like DDR serves them right.
2275313	2277594	I mean, seriously, that's the shit that would happen.
2277854	2281196	This is not fucking advertising or anything like that.
2281909	2285171	It's just... I'm sorry.
2285311	2287192	I saw that and I'm like, oh, come on.
2287672	2288153	Seriously.
2288393	2290094	And then I read it on every single blog.
2290134	2290734	I had the same thing.
2290814	2291635	Oh, good one up.
2291815	2292435	Go them.
2292495	2293856	I'm like, fuck that shit.
2294376	2296197	I'm going there less now because of this.
2296557	2297678	Going there less now.
2298638	2299679	25% less because of that.
2300620	2305102	Yeah, let's see their... I bet you that fucking protest shit's in their goddamn EGM, too.
2305162	2306583	How much you want to bet that shit is?
2307165	2311268	Oh, they're so independent and awesome and unbiased.
2311288	2312468	Let's put it in our magazine, too.
2312508	2313629	Look how holy we are.
2313689	2315650	You know, I just realized I have Tuesday off work.
2316691	2320874	Maybe I should go down there with a sign that says, Thank you for firing him.
2321914	2323475	Orange Lounge Radio.
2324156	2326077	Those fuckers who like DDR.
2326757	2327658	Just to see what happens.
2327758	2328198	No, I'm kidding.
2328218	2329419	I have better things to do on Tuesday.
2330143	2330863	No, you don't.
2330983	2332684	No, I'm going to see the Spice Girls.
2332704	2334085	What are you talking about?
2334165	2336006	I have much better things to do on Tuesday.
2336026	2336366	Whatever.
2336406	2337587	Okay, let's just, you know.
2338547	2341529	Okay, the fact of the matter is, okay, we don't know why he was fired.
2341589	2342869	We assume it's because of this.
2343329	2344730	Yeah, this is going on in the industry.
2344790	2345310	Big whoop.
2345330	2346971	You know, other things go on in the industry, too.
2347051	2353814	Like, I don't know, certain media outlets getting to break street on certain news stories and stuff like that.
2354075	2355775	Or no such embargo for them.
2356176	2356936	Because, you know, they...
2357355	2359395	Make a lot of money in advertising, that kind of thing.
2359435	2360956	Yeah, that kind of stuff happens as well.
2361156	2367657	There's a whole lot of shit you don't see that happens behind the scene day to day, but we all deal with it, and guess what?
2367717	2370017	Things aren't going to change, so get over it.
2370237	2373998	And really, in a month, who's going to be fucking talking about this?
2374018	2374858	Who's going to give a shit?
2374978	2379039	If you want genuine reviews, ask someone that's actually played a damn game, your friends.
2379579	2380239	Irene, I don't know.
2380839	2384300	I do think there is going to be some type of long-lasting effect this whole thing has.
2384921	2393087	because I think people are going to, I think companies are going to watch what happens to the whole rah, rah, rah, my mentality, we hate you GameSpot type thing that goes on.
2393628	2400153	And I think there's going to be a lot of, you're going to see, I think the big sites post about their integrity.
2400193	2406678	Like I think you're going to see the competitors like 1UP and IGM make things about their integrity and their reviews and their corporate policies.
2406698	2407459	Well, wait a minute.
2407579	2412983	Let's refer it back to an old situation that concerned, you know,
2413496	2418699	and mishandling or mistreatment of employees at a gaming establishment.
2418739	2420860	Like, look at, what was it, the EA spouse?
2421720	2423181	How long did we talk about that?
2424002	2427743	You know, the EA spouse that was like, oh, my husband's working too long or whatever.
2428484	2429384	Lasted about a month.
2429544	2435307	Yeah, they raised issues of like, you know, oh, you know, look at them, they're evil and blah, blah, blah.
2435327	2437409	But people still go and work for them.
2437549	2438969	People still buy their games.
2439249	2440130	No one's really like,
2440743	2442444	EA did not go under as a company.
2442564	2444145	Like, no one gives a shit anymore.
2444165	2445306	Did they put a hit on her?
2445846	2446867	I mean... I don't know.
2447787	2449248	Because nobody talks about it anymore.
2449268	2449969	How the fuck do I know?
2450029	2452110	No, I think I remember seeing... No, I'm just teasing, obviously.
2452130	2455172	I think I remember seeing a story like a year ago, like she was unmasked.
2455552	2457513	And we found out who she really was and all that stuff.
2458014	2459255	I'll start writing reviews.
2459515	2461116	And then the companies can start paying me.
2461316	2462296	Because I need money.
2463517	2464438	No, but seriously, though.
2464518	2467219	I mean, if I had the free time, I'd write reviews.
2467280	2468500	But I don't have the fucking free time.
2468560	2469441	I have to work.
2469481	2469621	Yeah.
2470120	2473302	and then I have a wife that I want to go home and a cat that wants me to play with it.
2473422	2476425	So, you know, I have to do these things.
2476445	2479046	Do you want me to put a head out on your cat?
2481068	2481688	Maybe my wife.
2482989	2483329	Wow.
2484911	2486532	Wow, that was mean.
2486552	2487032	Dang.
2488393	2488493	Ow.
2489374	2489774	Oh, snap.
2489794	2492096	Was that Freudian or was that intentional?
2492116	2493777	Views and opinions expressed on this program.
2494818	2495158	Let's see.
2495818	2497680	The chat room's been lighting up and I've been ignoring them.
2497720	2498020	Sorry, guys.
2499372	2501534	Odd1 says, I don't know, did I already read this one?
2501734	2502574	I don't think I did.
2503015	2507377	I think the developers give the gaming press more credit than they're worth, especially in the face of the internet.
2507737	2509658	The word gets out, we have our ears to the ground.
2509738	2515141	Yes, you can get exclusive news from the corporate sites, but the message boards, podcasts, and indie sites are where it's at.
2515562	2519164	If Eidos was stupid enough to push this, seriously, I'd love to see them burn.
2520424	2523126	I have a feeling, actually, I have kind of a strange feeling that
2523579	2524840	IDOS has nothing to do with this.
2524860	2532845	I think maybe they were like, they were probably a little pissed, and they probably let GameSpot know that, but, you know, they also probably kind of realized that there wasn't a lot they could do about it.
2533465	2534345	So, I don't know.
2534406	2538228	I have a feeling if anybody's probably getting a bad rap over this, it's actually probably them.
2538448	2538748	I don't know.
2538828	2541410	It's just kind of what my gut tells me about this whole mom mentality thing.
2541430	2542650	Yeah, I don't think they had much to do with it.
2542670	2545132	I don't think they can directly, say, fire this person.
2545652	2550255	I mean, if it was EA, maybe, you know, maybe, but, I mean, we're talking IDOS here.
2550275	2551956	I mean, what, Tomb Raider, Hitman?
2553052	2554813	That's it.
2555074	2560218	Gerardimo says, Dear world, go get your own opinion and decide if the game is good or not yourself.
2560998	2563420	Macman says, I like the idea from all games interactive.
2563520	2564621	Sound effect reviews.
2565061	2567623	Okay, this game is audience laughter out of Mario Jump.
2570366	2570726	Brilliant.
2572247	2572727	Let's see.
2573468	2578432	TigerClaw in response to the 1UP protest says, Maybe it's a sign that 1UP would like Gertzman to work for them.
2579482	2579862	Who knows?
2580622	2582363	Odd1 says, Ziff is all about the publicity.
2582383	2583843	They're good with Flickr and all that shit.
2583863	2586344	I'm not surprised they videotape almost everything they do.
2587104	2587365	Hmm.
2589185	2590045	Let's see.
2590065	2594307	Yeah, I don't see Eidos pressuring them to fire this guy.
2595667	2602670	I mean, EA or something, like if they gave Madden a really shitty score or something like that, because they're a big company and have a lot of money to throw around, but...
2604699	2605860	IDOS, I mean, what?
2606221	2607722	Would they have come out recently?
2608062	2609744	Tomb Raider Anniversary Edition?
2609984	2613168	I mean... Alright, well, we've spent a lot of time talking about this topic.
2613228	2618453	We want to move on to some other news, but I'm sure we'll hear a lot about this on the Skype line later.
2618793	2622697	And of course, there always is our mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
2623418	2627162	Meanwhile, more news, and let's talk about the virtual console on the Wii.
2627182	2628443	We'll start off with some Wii news tonight.
2629326	2630427	This is great news.
2630507	2635091	This makes me think Nintendo finally gets it, what we really want, in a way.
2635951	2641836	Pokemon Snap is coming out on the Wii's virtual console in Japan, and usually this would be no big deal.
2641936	2650562	However, the pictures that you take inside the game, you can now post to your Wii message board and send around on the address book.
2650983	2657348	So if you've taken a picture of Pikachu doing a little dance or something, and you think it's really cute, I could send that over to
2659256	2661879	No, you won't.
2662099	2663000	I'll just delete it.
2663461	2665363	And I'll defriend you, if that's possible.
2665936	2671899	Now, I think a lot of us have been shouting from the mountaintops for years, well, at least years, since the Wii came out.
2672279	2679223	We want to see additional functionality in the virtual console games, like online play and things like this.
2679703	2684245	So the fact that they've done this for Pokemon Snap shows that it's possible, right?
2684265	2686166	Why did they have to do it with Pokemon Snap?
2686226	2686926	God damn it.
2686966	2688907	Why couldn't they pick a better game to do it with?
2689267	2691989	Like, nobody gives a shit about taking pictures of stupid Pokemon.
2692709	2694210	Hey, I love Pokemon Snap.
2694250	2694570	Shut up.
2695154	2696194	Yeah, well, it's stupid.
2697215	2697835	You're stupid.
2698335	2698715	Anyways.
2699475	2704357	Odd1 says, Message board posts of Pokemon in near sexual positions up 500%.
2706797	2709078	Pokemon Snap has now become Pokemon Slash.
2709318	2710038	Good job, everybody.
2712479	2716280	Of course, they're making a lot of money off of Pokemon Snap and other virtual console titles.
2716650	2725774	Nintendo estimates that they've made $33 million on the Virtual Console alone, and that kind of includes 7.8 million downloads across the service.
2726975	2727255	Wow.
2728735	2729296	Lots of money.
2730376	2732097	And it's free money, essentially.
2732157	2735378	I mean, I can't imagine the Virtual Console takes that much work.
2735598	2736799	All that bandwidth!
2737558	2751849	Well, it's not just that, but obviously, you know, they kind of have rewritten all the manuals in the Wii, because, you know, the Wii thing has their own manuals and stuff, and I'm sure they still have to do QA on all the games and what have you, so it's not like they do it completely free, but it's certainly much cheaper than making a new game.
2752549	2752750	Yeah.
2753310	2761236	So, this is very, probably very high cost efficiency type thing, cost gains, whatever they call that in the business world.
2761256	2765079	Remember, they sell each one of those consoles at, you know, profit, so.
2765908	2772733	All right, well, speaking of the Virtual Console, some more titles coming out have been spoiled by the one and only ESRB.
2772773	2783221	So you can expect in the near future Top Hunter for the Neo Geo, Puyo Puyo 2 for the Genesis, King of Fighters 94 on the Neo Geo, Baseball Stars 2, Bases Loaded on the NES.
2783261	2784382	That game was pretty awesome, actually.
2784702	2789766	The Dynastic Hero on the TurboGrafx-16 and Power Golf on the Neo Geo as well.
2789786	2789846	Wow.
2790778	2793501	All must be making their way sometime in the near future.
2793962	2802391	Also just wanted to say really quickly that it's also been spoiled that on the Japanese Virtual Console they'll be getting Treasure Hunter G, which is a game I vaguely remember.
2803271	2806373	Why aren't they releasing better titles?
2806493	2807574	I don't understand.
2807794	2811357	Well, Treasure Hunter G was actually a pretty awesome RPG 16-bit.
2811377	2813759	It kind of reminisced in a Final Fantasy 6 a little bit.
2813779	2818142	Yeah, it looks pretty cool, but I mean, the other games, like fucking Power Golf, who the hell played that?
2818782	2822065	Bases Loaded, whatever, that's an okay game, I guess.
2822085	2825127	Bases Loaded was kind of cool, but Baseball Stars was better.
2826853	2831777	I didn't play any baseball games on the NES because I don't care about sports games.
2831857	2832457	You know what's weird?
2832578	2838703	Usually I'm not into sports games either, but I liked, here's the thing, I liked sports games a lot when they were simple.
2839503	2841525	That's why I loved NBA Jam so much.
2841585	2848891	I mean, that game was relatively, I mean, that game was kind of made for, you know, dummies who can't really play basketball but enjoy to watch it, you know?
2849772	2851013	That's why I liked NBA Jam.
2851714	2851894	Anyhow.
2852162	2853923	Gameplay footage, interviews, etc.
2881010	2886215	BoxArt, release schedules for the DS and the Wii, and other fun stuff.
2886495	2890338	And hopefully soon, demos for Wii games as well.
2890919	2899627	But right now they've got some different Touch Generation title demos, and of course the Japanese versions of Pokemon Diamond and Pearl.
2900606	2904475	Now, this seems like a very natural thing that Nintendo probably should have had a while ago.
2904875	2906659	Any word on when we might get this in the U.S.
2906760	2906940	at all?
2907000	2910708	Fuck if I know, but this is something they were promising, what, before the Wii ever came out?
2910848	2911089	Mm-hmm.
2911960	2912420	WeConnect24, come on!
2933897	2936599	Granted, you might be looking... No, I don't, because I have Wii Connect 24 turned off.
2936659	2943886	You're looking at your Wii at 5 o'clock at night, and you see the weather from midnight that morning, but... Wii Connect 24 doesn't like my mod chip.
2946028	2946368	Wows.
2947068	2947389	All right.
2948790	2949230	Let's see.
2950031	2952713	Macman says, Everybody's Nintendo channel in America.
2952914	2956857	Now, Nintendo, kill the chibi motherfucking robo team and get to work on it!
2959175	2960896	That's an order from Macman in chat.
2961116	2962697	Yeah, stop making chibi robo games.
2962737	2963178	They suck.
2963198	2963618	That's right.
2963678	2964899	Just knock it off.
2965759	2966880	We're not saying fire those guys.
2966920	2968181	Just put them to work elsewhere.
2969022	2969162	Anyhow.
2969182	2970122	I'm saying fire those guys.
2971681	2978127	Anyhow, you might have heard earlier in the show I mentioned that I was a fan of the game Eternal Sonata that came out a little earlier this year.
2978848	2982992	TriCrescendo was the folks that made this game.
2983773	2986676	And they're now working on a new game called Fragile.
2987056	2993362	And it's a new RPG that's going to be coming out for the Nintendo Wii, which is a system that Eternal Sonata was not on.
2993442	2995805	It's on 360 and going to be coming on PS3.
2996545	2999026	but Fragile is going to be coming out on the Nintendo Wii.
2999706	3005608	All we know so far is that the main character is a guy named Set and you explore various cities.
3005688	3008709	It takes place in a post-apocalyptic world.
3009550	3021194	Most of the details at this time are in Japanese but there is an official website up at fragile.nomco-ch.net and there's also a little teaser trailer out there on the internet for the game.
3022567	3030850	I'm sure a lot of people are kind of excited about this because, you know, obviously the first generation of Wii games felt like ported PlayStation 2 games with motion control.
3031170	3034351	So these type of game announcements get people excited for what the Wii can really do.
3034631	3034871	Cool.
3035211	3046894	And that reminds me, there's another game that's going to be coming out here, Opuna, that came out in Japan, I believe, and it's coming out over here in like February, I want to say.
3046914	3049595	I'm going to check out the Japanese version next week, hopefully, too.
3050111	3079374	Although I don't really know how much I'm going to be able to play of those games Especially roleplaying games because they're all in Japanese And I speak no Japanese Or at least very little Japanese Anyways, the Nintendo DS in the UK has set some new sales records They have sold 191,000 units in the UK And that's more than any other hardware format has achieved in a 7 day period So that's a pretty good week for them I guess
3081466	3089653	The previous record was held by the PSP during its launch in September of 2005, where it sold 185,000 units.
3092776	3094537	How about we start looking at some release dates?
3095138	3101743	Travel the world and look at games that you can pick up in the UK right now, if you think another game should be selling a lot of units.
3101823	3108389	Actually, first, before we get into release dates, one thing we promised a few weeks ago on the show is that we would be tracking sales numbers.
3109069	3112670	because we have ways of getting the MPD sales numbers.
3113030	3117852	And obviously one game you guys want to know the sales on is Eye of Judgment.
3118232	3119412	And that's because of the bet.
3119912	3127974	If you recall, a bet was made on this program that Eye of Judgment, as Loki said, would no way in hell sell a million copies within six months of release.
3128314	3137497	In fact, if the game manages to sell one million copies in six months within its release, Loki has said he will dress up in a Tingle outfit and dance around
3137924	3142788	in the garage, setting an eye of judgment on fire while playing a game versus Bobby Blackwolf.
3144509	3145150	All on video.
3145270	3148392	All on video for YouTube for years to come.
3149373	3153817	However, we have to get the game to sell a million units first, and we have an update on the numbers.
3153957	3156299	Loki, how many units are we there?
3156359	3156939	Are we there yet?
3157119	3160822	Well, at least in the US, we're up to 17,600 units.
3162724	3165386	But I will have you know, though, that's just from
3166005	3167626	Launch to December 3rd.
3167846	3169026	I haven't gotten the new numbers yet.
3169226	3173788	Hopefully, in the next couple weeks, I'll have new numbers for... So that's about within the first three weeks of release.
3174728	3175509	Like two or three, yeah.
3175549	3175809	All right.
3176129	3178830	So we're 1.7% of the way there.
3179630	3180231	Yay.
3181251	3182191	Making good progress.
3182211	3183032	Keep at it, guys.
3183552	3184272	Good luck to you.
3186853	3188774	I'm looking at the chat room to see what's going on.
3189494	3191655	Dartetsuya says, that's it?
3194847	3196368	Desgaea makes his way to the PSP
3224047	3240379	Dragon Blade, Wrath of Fire comes out on the Wii Juiced 2 on the PC Link's Crossbow Training comes out on the Nintendo Wii Myst comes out on the DS I forgot that they were remaking the old Myst games on DS That's what this is, right?
3240959	3243861	Yeah That's pretty rad Is that out here in the US?
3243941	3245523	I don't think on the DS, I know it's on PSP
3246696	3250617	Pokemon Battle Revolution finally comes out on the Wii over in Europe this week.
3250697	3254059	Pro Evo Soccer 2008 on the DS also this week on the 7th.
3254479	3258460	SingStar PlayStation 3 finally this week on the 7th.

3268804	3272285	Tomb Raider Anniversary makes its way to the Wii and Ultimate Mortal Kombat on the DS.
3272925	3274586	and PlayStation 3 isn't left out.
3274786	3276647	Uncharted, Drake's Fortune comes out.
3277228	3283872	And if you're looking for something a little more casual, something mom can get into, Who Wants to Be a Millionaire comes out on the Wii this week.
3284192	3286533	No word yet if Meredith Vieira stars or not.
3287394	3287674	Okay.
3288174	3290395	The U.S., we have Alvin and Chipmunks.
3290476	3294678	Actually, she wouldn't because those are the Europe release dates and they have a different host over there, so I look stupid.
3297152	3312605	in the US, Alvin and the Chipmunks coming out on PC, DS, Playstation 2 and I believe the Wii American Girl, Julie Finds A Way with I must say the most creepy cover for a game I have ever seen
3312998	3314319	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3331081	3332221	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3357478	3359760	Dragon Ball Z Budokai Tenkaichi 3 Draglade Dragon Ball Z Budokai Tenkaichi 3
3384603	3388126	Uh, small little game here called Dance Dance Revolution Universe 2.
3388266	3391509	The bundle only is coming out this week.
3392469	3395672	Um, Universe at War, Earth Assault.
3396012	3397674	When's the game itself come out?
3398494	3398915	Do we know?
3399275	3399715	January.
3400536	3401877	You want to hear something even weirder?
3402578	3405440	DDR Hottest Party, the game only version.
3405520	3406961	It's not coming out until April now.
3407202	3407402	Mm-hmm.
3408214	3409074	Godzilla Unleashed on the Wii
3438339	3439120	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3467062	3470105	Because you know you're supposed to do that in the regular game?
3470305	3472967	Is that what it says in the rules?
3473067	3473628	I don't know.
3473668	3478432	It's something my friend told me when I was a kid, so it probably was made up just to make me look stupid.
3479233	3481615	Everyone's like, what the hell are you talking about, Rob?
3481655	3482536	We don't do that.
3483096	3485218	Yeah, I believe that would be made up, Rob.
3487240	3489362	Anyways, that's it.
3490629	3494032	Viva Piñata Party Animals, or as they call it, Atsumare Viva Piñata Let's Party
3517341	3520704	Coming out on the Xbox 360, on the PlayStation 3, Conan as well.
3521104	3525467	Also Pirates of the Caribbean, At World's End comes out on December 6th.
3525547	3527249	Also Uncharted, Drake's Fortune.
3527909	3529911	And a brand new USB headset, if you're into that.
3530561	3540488	Also coming out on the Nintendo Wii, we have No More Heroes coming out on the 6th, as well as Rayman Raving Rabbids 2, or Rabbids Party Returns.
3540888	3544270	Did they really need to make a sequel to that shitty-ass game?
3544650	3545771	Oh my god, that game was awful.
3545791	3547432	Actually, I hear the second one is pretty good.
3547592	3548032	It's pretty fun.
3549650	3550631	because they've taken over Earth.
3551351	3554754	Namco's putting out a game called, or I'm sorry, Bandai, well, it's the same thing.
3555114	3569346	Mina de Asubo de Namco Carnival comes out on the Wii, which I'm sure is just probably a collection of past games, or it might be, I don't know, this might be some type of Mario Party game, but starring the Namco characters.
3569606	3576332	I think that's actually the Namco collection that came out over here.
3576692	3576772	Ah.
3577604	3580065	Oh, okay, with the upgraded games and stuff?
3580266	3580946	That makes sense.
3581666	3589050	Also coming out on the Wii from Sega, Doraemon Wii, Himitsu Dugoketaisen is coming out.
3589410	3594373	Also, wait for it, Disney Princess Enchanted Journey this week on the Wii.
3594433	3594853	Yay!
3595753	3600916	Also another Tamagotchi game, Tamagotchi no Fury Fury, Kajikaiden comes out as well.
3600936	3603778	I hope, I want to play No More Heroes, that looks fun.
3603798	3607980	The PlayStation 2, lots of stuff as well, another version of Pirates of the Caribbean at World's End.
3608501	3613964	Another Mahjong game, hooray, Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories finally comes out on the PlayStation 2.
3614944	3620227	And another version of Disney Princess Enchanted Journey, as well as a game called Finalist.
3620788	3624650	I think that's just a price reduction though, it was already a game out there from Princess Soft.
3625728	3626669	Doko Demo Raku Raku DS Kakkaibo
3650983	3651764	This is the thing, though.
3652064	3655665	You always kind of worry because they advertise on the box how cheap it is.
3657706	3659146	Very cheap old game.
3660667	3665249	Also, K1 World GP comes out on the DS.
3665849	3667309	And you want me to try to pronounce this one?
3667429	3668450	This one's going to be a ton of fun.
3668490	3668850	Here it is.
3671316	3683605	It's a language learning program, which apparently I need.
3684185	3685106	Yeah, you really do.
3687067	3690510	I can special order this game from Japan.
3691210	3695734	Except it probably won't help me because it's probably for Japanese people to learn other languages.
3696334	3697215	So I'll be screwed.
3698034	3700997	Also on the DS, Tales of Innocence comes out.
3701057	3702418	That's a Namco game.
3703899	3706060	And, wow, pretty big week in Japan, I must say.
3706661	3711004	But I guess they don't have the big shopping day like we do here, so they get games right up until Christmas.
3712145	3715848	Coming out on PSP, another version of Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories.
3716388	3719791	Also, Silent Hill Zero comes out, which was Silent Hill Origins here.
3721272	3726096	Minano Golf Portable 2, that's just Hot Shots Golf, comes out over there as well.
3727097	3727277	And...
3728083	3728443	That's it.
3729784	3730064	Awesome.
3731905	3735706	Anyways, so this is actually pretty recent news.
3735926	3741789	Activision and Vividi have merged into one super company.
3742789	3749492	Activision, you'll know, of course, behind the such wonderful series as Call of Duty, Tony Hawk, and the lesser known Cabela's.
3750232	3754334	And Vividi, of course, behind such wonderful games as Spyro,
3755760	3759603	Scarface, and a small little game called World of Warcraft.
3759943	3761985	They own Blizzard, which is behind World of Warcraft.
3762725	3769730	Of course, this whole merger, you know, it's going to be pretty good, I'd say, for both companies.
3769970	3772131	But, you know, millions of dollars here.
3772151	3772992	Actually, billions of dollars.
3773012	3774113	But bad for the gamers.
3774593	3775213	No, I'm just kidding.
3775233	3775854	I have no idea.
3775874	3776674	$18 billion deal.
3776714	3776834	Woo!
3776854	3778115	That's a lot of money.
3778135	3778315	So, yeah.
3782503	3783784	Activision BlizzCon Activivendi Activivendi
3803405	3805286	Decide which company gets to keep its name.
3805546	3807808	Or VivendiVision or something.
3808008	3812671	I just hope this means we get the level 70 Torrent Chieftain Warrior songs in Guitar Hero.
3812751	3815072	You already made that joke earlier, Rob.
3815392	3816373	When we weren't on air.
3816393	3819194	Why don't they just call the company World of Warcraft?
3819234	3820135	They should.
3820175	3821396	There you go.
3821436	3824878	World of Warcraft for World of Warcraft players.
3826259	3827199	That's a great idea.
3829289	3829829	I doubt it.
3829849	3830630	I don't think it will either.
3830650	3830910	Why would it?
3830930	3831050	I mean...
3850347	3850587	I don't know.
3880168	3881109	Project Gotham Kodo Racing
3911573	3919537	I, I, I, that would be my guess on what's going to happen is that, you know, some of the Blizzard franchises that Blizzard has not had time to pay attention to.
3919557	3922158	Guitar Hero is the new... Activision will make Diablo 3.
3923599	3925040	Somebody's, somebody's going to do it.
3925060	3928001	Guitar Hero is the new class in the next Warcraft.
3928142	3929542	Oh, that'd be awesome!
3930363	3930983	Expansion.
3931003	3932164	Being able to play instruments.
3934429	3937611	Yeah, we can come up with tons of dumb ideas.
3938031	3943534	Frisbee says there's no trucks in World of Warcraft, making reference to that commercial from a little while ago.
3944874	3945895	I want a game, though.
3945915	3954419	I think it would be cool to have a role-playing game online that has a bunch of weird shit in it that makes no sense whatsoever, because I've never played a game like that.
3955180	3955760	Exactly!
3955900	3959622	But I'm talking like absolutely like crazy shit.
3959662	3963384	Like, you know, where you can summon a giant jeep to come through and like crash people.
3963665	3965526	Just for no apparent reason, you know?
3965586	3966886	Just like crazy shit.
3967006	3967607	Oh my god.
3967767	3973710	So are you proposing that you need to meet with the heads of Activision Blizzard to propose Loki's World of Randomness?
3974691	3976331	Hey, I like the ring of that.
3978813	3979773	I think I might buy that.
3979813	3982715	Chatroom, would you buy a game called Loki's World of Randomness?
3984389	3986030	I'm going to attack you with my cat.
3987710	3988411	Laser cats.
3989951	3990592	Laser cats.
3990612	3991952	We'll license laser cats.
3994233	3994733	There you have it.
3994753	3995594	Ten million right there.
3996734	3998155	Giant jelly bean attacks.
3998775	4000516	Oh no, zap it with a laser cat.
4000956	4001796	Oh my god.
4002237	4005458	I summon the truck to run it over.
4005538	4006158	Never mind, forget it.
4006218	4007979	Less QQ, more Mew Mew.
4008919	4009740	That was awful.
4012082	4012802	You should move on.
4012822	4014043	The doctor says, I would pay $300.
4014603	4017784	Dark Tetsuya says, do want.
4022486	4025988	Dark Tetsuya gave you a LOL Irene for your less QQ, more Mew Mew.
4026228	4026468	Yay.
4026508	4026868	I like that.
4026888	4027328	That was good.
4027788	4028168	Good times.
4029349	4029789	All righty.
4030629	4031050	Sony.
4031930	4033390	What the hell is that?
4033470	4033731	What?
4033851	4035731	Sony has just... Talking Dolphin?
4036072	4036232	It's...
4037668	4040549	It's unfortunately a reference to a book that sucks.
4040809	4041030	Yeah.
4041670	4041990	Anyhow.
4043230	4048313	Sony has decided to drop their ad agency of the past 13 years.
4048873	4050754	Why did they decide to drop it now?
4050814	4060338	Well, I'm guessing probably after what happened in hindsight of the whole PlayStation 3 debacle where the ads were not so hot.
4061058	4061718	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4076167	4076687	Okay.
4076947	4084450	For reference, the ad agency was TBWA Chiat Day was the full name of the ad agency.
4084950	4088852	And if you're wondering, does this affect both the U.S.
4089012	4089432	and Europe?
4089492	4090092	Yes, it does.
4090153	4093354	They were also the ones that created the whole black and white campaign.
4093394	4096475	Remember that thing for the PSP that some people called racist?
4096995	4100316	And the other like Circus de Soleil one they have going on.
4100557	4102197	This has been kind of a long time coming.
4103158	4103598	Oh, my God.
4103638	4104178	Some might say.
4105362	4112166	Anyways, just in case you're worried that Grand Theft Auto might not be coming out pretty soon, well, we still don't know when it's coming out.
4112266	4127835	But they are starting to run some more videos and stuff for it, including a box art reveal trailer, which they elaborately painted a giant copy of the box art for Grand Theft Auto 4 on a giant canvas painting.
4128667	4131289	And it looks pretty awesome, but, you know, your typical Grand Theft Auto game.
4131309	4132890	It's like every other Grand Theft Auto game I've ever seen.
4132910	4134031	Yeah, your typical Grand Theft Auto one.
4134051	4138514	Of course, people are dissecting it and saying, oh my god, there's motorcycles and helicopters in the game.
4138594	4139034	Oh, really?
4139134	4140035	Like every other game.
4140595	4142117	Anyways, um, so.
4142217	4145539	I hope the giant air tram can be used as like a weapon or something.
4146159	4147080	That would be awesome.
4147120	4149161	I hope you can cut the cables to that thing.
4151363	4152744	Ooh, I wish.
4153243	4159046	Anyways, but there's going to be a brand new trailer on December 6th, which is entitled Move Up, Ladies.
4161388	4162428	Move up, ladies!
4163509	4167351	What the hell?
4167391	4169352	Next Thursday at 3 p.m.
4169512	4173835	Eastern time is when you can expect that trailer, when the internet explodes with it all over the place.
4173855	4179798	Yeah, but you can expect to see it 24 hours later after the traffic dies down, because you know their servers are going to get killed when the trailer comes out.
4180339	4182420	Because, like, didn't they say when the first one came out,
4183306	4186430	Um, that it broke the internet?
4187010	4188872	Yeah, something like that.
4188973	4192697	But hey, that's good that they're showing trailers because that means that there's more work being done on it.
4192717	4195560	At least that's what I'd like to assume.
4196545	4200406	Some new details have come out for another game that's getting an anticipated sequel next year.
4200506	4203007	Silent Hill 5 comes out next year.
4203787	4205307	And some new details have come out about the game.
4205747	4209889	The flashlight and radio static is going to be returning to the game.
4210109	4212689	Those kind of features didn't really exist in Silent Hill 4.
4213350	4217851	But then again, that's not very surprising because Silent Hill 4 was not even originally going to be a Silent Hill game.
4217971	4218851	So what have you.
4220133	4224496	Light apparently is going to actually kind of have a pretty major function in this game.
4225117	4228499	The enemies will respond based on whatever the light is doing.
4229000	4235425	There's also going to be some puzzles that involve an x-ray viewer and nurses that, you know, are doing scary things.
4235925	4243051	So it sounds like the game, of course, is being greatly inspired by the Silent Hill movie, but I don't think that's such a bad thing, to be honest.
4243644	4244485	I loved the movie.
4244745	4245806	Here's the other biggest change.
4245846	4249128	Silent Hill 5 will not have preset camera angles.
4249888	4250189	Really?
4250209	4252550	You will control the entire visuals.
4253271	4256553	That's actually... I'm not sure how I feel about that.
4257374	4259715	That could be a double-edged sword there.
4260176	4271463	And then the other thing that's kind of weird about it too is the damage system that they have in it now is going to be like Metal Gear Solid 3 where there's just not health power-ups anymore to heal you.
4271503	4272204	You have to like
4273314	4273674	I don't know.
4274714	4275795	Kill a snake and eat it.
4275955	4284117	Break a grenade open and like, you know... Silent Hill 5, break a grenade open and... Like Rambo style or something, I don't know.
4284437	4284938	Hmm.
4285318	4286238	That's gonna be interesting.
4286338	4294100	Also, there's supposed to be a minigame that has puzzles from like God of War, which were like DDR-ish in a way, button tapping things.
4294660	4300662	Oh God, like every other fucking game on Earth now with the stupid context sensitive shit.
4301082	4302883	Yes, but Konami made DDR, so...
4303824	4307647	It's not like DDR, it's just Shenmue did it first.
4308627	4309007	Whatever.
4309788	4317793	Anyways, Metal Gear Solid 4, according to the producer, must sell a million copies day one in order for them to make their money.
4320855	4328520	So with that being released exclusively on the PlayStation 3 right now, that's going to be pretty hard for them to do.
4329656	4333117	I mean, if the Eye of Judgment could only sell 17,000 in the first three weeks.
4333197	4333817	Let me put it this way.
4334137	4337519	No PlayStation 3 to date has sold a million copies day one.
4340359	4344581	I don't know if any of them have sold a million copies at all.
4345101	4351623	I mean, granted, if there was going to be a game that's going to do that, I'd say Metal Gear Solid 4 would probably be it.
4351923	4354104	Are we sure this guy wasn't just exaggerating a little bit?
4355364	4356645	No, just because of the...
4358044	4358705	DarkSakura.com
4377760	4394077	but then again also people wanting to draw that conclusion well if they can't sell a million units on the Playstation 3 maybe if they developed it for the Xbox 360 as well they could sell a million units and whatever maybe it'll come out on Xbox 360 someday
4395683	4405141	Alright, well, PC gamers are going to be very happy to hear, especially those that are into first-person shooters blended with RPGs, that Deus Ex is getting another sequel.
4405241	4407425	Deus Ex 3 is coming out from Eidos.
4408671	4413595	This was announced when they were talking about their newest studio in Montreal, which opened up a little earlier this year.
4414656	4417858	The studio hopes to expand to about 350 people in the year 2009.
4418459	4422642	And they just recently have started development on the game.
4422682	4425745	It just passed proof-of-concept stage, Deus Ex 3.
4425845	4428988	So we will see what develops on this game.
4429028	4433231	I'm sure lots of people are foaming at the mouth because I know this is a very popular game on the PC.
4434092	4434212	Hmm.
4435424	4438866	Now, here's a strange rumor that's coming from a very unusual source.
4439446	4445328	The unofficial Artie Lang site, and Artie Lang, you might know him from the Howard Stern show.
4445488	4452691	Apparently, Lang will be voicing the role of a character named Big Al in an upcoming Leisure Suit Larry game.
4453592	4453712	Oh, God.
4453752	4457933	Which I think is pretty cool that they're making another Leisure Suit Larry game.
4457953	4459494	That's so fitting.
4460174	4464657	That's a very interesting way, I guess, that they found out that a new game was coming.
4465238	4470221	No word on when it's coming or what it's going to be, but interesting.
4474524	4478367	Yeah, I don't think a new Leisure Suit Larry game is going to really be that impressive, to be honest.
4478507	4479488	No, the last one wasn't.
4480669	4489015	Well, IGN has recently published their list of the OMG Top 100 Games of All Time list.
4489715	4491728	Don't we get a list like this every couple of years?
4491929	4492311	Every year.
4493260	4494661	Metal Gear Solid was number 24.
4521607	4523168	Doom was number 19.
4523728	4525648	Chrono Trigger was number 18.
4525889	4527329	Boo, it should be number 1.
4527689	4528930	17 was Super Mario World.
4529910	4531210	16 was Shadow of the Colossus.
4532211	4533811	15 was Castlevania Symphony of the Night.
4534752	4537032	14 was Pirates by Sid Meier.
4537052	4537573	13 was Ms.
4537633	4538173	Pac-Man.
4539073	4540714	12 was Star Wars Tie Fighter.
4541834	4543635	I like that this list included PC games too.
4543655	4544955	11 was StarCraft.
4545255	4546056	Alright, then here's the top 10.
4546416	4549877	Resident Evil 4 was number 10 on the GameCube.
4549897	4549957	Wow.
4550838	4554661	and, you know, obviously that game got a lot of Game of the Year accolades when it came out.
4554701	4555521	It is a pretty great game.
4556682	4566349	Final Fantasy III or VI by the Japanese scale was the number nine game of all time, which I believe is the highest ranking Final Fantasy game on the list.
4566389	4571232	So Final Fantasy VII was not in the top ten, which I'm sure makes fanboys mad, but I think that's okay.
4572273	4575075	Number eight was The Legend of Zelda, A Link to the Past.
4576876	4578617	Number seven was Super Metroid.
4579449	4580090	Oh, I love Super Metroid.
4580110	4581891	Which will probably be my number one, honestly.
4582271	4583572	Number six was Half-Life 2.
4585153	4592698	Number five was Super Mario 64, which a lot of people would probably put as their number one, so it's kind of interesting that there's still some more games to go here.
4593118	4595540	Number four is The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time.
4596060	4598362	So that's two Zeldas in the top ten?
4598662	4601524	Well, you know, the Zelda games are great games.
4601624	4602264	I'm just confirming.
4602525	4604726	Yeah, no, it's two Zelda games in the top ten so far.
4605667	4607128	Number three is Civilization 2.
4608846	4611967	God bless them for remembering the Civilization series because it is a great series.
4612827	4614267	It does deserve to be that high on the list.
4615428	4617488	Although I would have put the original Civilization, but that's just me.
4618188	4619529	Number two is Tetris.
4619669	4620189	Tetris.
4620389	4621589	Hmm, what's number one?
4621649	4622589	What do you think number one?
4622629	4624370	The number one greatest game of all time.
4624910	4625490	Pac-Man?
4627170	4628011	Super Mario Bros.
4628051	4628591	on the NES.
4628611	4630691	The very first original Super Mario Bros.
4630731	4632031	game.
4632432	4634052	That does make a lot of sense because...
4634981	4636722	Who doesn't remember Super Mario Bros.?
4637123	4640826	If you play the theme for somebody, who doesn't know that theme and what that is?
4640846	4643127	Yeah, Mario is part of pop culture.
4643207	4645109	People know who Mario is.
4646029	4647611	So it makes a lot of sense.
4647691	4648892	And it was a pretty good game at the time.
4649072	4649552	Well, yeah.
4649632	4650133	So there you go.
4651013	4651434	Still is.
4652054	4652334	All right.
4652494	4654156	Well, there's a different website.
4654936	4656537	Also happens to be affiliated with IGN.
4656557	4658199	Doing another top ten list.
4658619	4662702	This, of course, is Ask Men's Top Ten Hottest Women in Tech.
4664918	4665218	Uh-huh.
4665258	4667299	We'll run down this list here real quick, too.
4668239	4674481	Number 10, Wendy Chang, who apparently is, let's see here.
4674881	4675281	Don't know her.
4675681	4676181	Don't know her.
4676221	4682383	She apparently does vidcasts on a network, clicknetwork.tv.
4683984	4685764	But she has big boobies, so that's fine.
4686004	4688445	And she's Asian, so two points there.
4688845	4690686	Bryce Princess has big boobies, and she's Asian.
4690706	4691206	Oh, stop it.
4691846	4692266	Anyways.
4692546	4694227	I don't do my own video games, so...
4696546	4702409	Let's see, Blair Butler, who is a stand-up comedian.
4702429	4703850	Don't know her.
4705151	4709134	And she's on X-Play, apparently, or she's a writer on X-Play.
4710034	4717079	And she also has a reoccurring bit in Tell Geek Out that appears on G4's website.
4719040	4720601	Are all these people G4 people?
4720961	4721041	No.
4722192	4735524	Kristen Holt, Dallas Cowboys Cheerleader, and now she's the host of G-Force Cheat.
4738146	4742990	She also hosts a new game called Shout About Television.
4744391	4747293	And she's working also as a tech reporter on Attack of the Shell.
4747313	4750216	Some might call this podcast Shout About Video Games.
4750950	4751630	Veronica Belmont
4775783	4795950	Not related, no relation to Simon Boring, then I don't give a shit about her Never heard of her She has, I guess, a, she's acted as a producer and sound engineer for CNET's Buzz Out Loud podcast Let's move it a little faster, Loki Sorry Any guesses?
4795990	4803333	Number one, Morgan Webb No, this is not number one Actually, here, I'll just skip to number one We'll do a top three here real quick Thank you
4803806	4806747	We don't know any other people.
4806767	4807787	We don't know any other people.
4831317	4832118	and get paid for it.
4832238	4833659	That's what women do naturally.
4834179	4835520	They're so good at it.
4835920	4837861	Morgan Webb, of course, she's on X-Play.
4838162	4840803	Who's at number one, then?
4840983	4843065	Number one is Amber MacArthur.
4843085	4844946	Oh, yes.
4844966	4846647	I've never heard of her.
4846687	4850750	She's on G4's TechTV Canada's Call for Help show.
4850990	4852291	Okay, I have to see what she looks like.
4852831	4856393	She's not that standout.
4856894	4857794	She's very plain.
4858275	4860176	You know who she looks like?
4861155	4862195	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4887389	4888090	The character.
4890091	4891733	But, wow, whoop-dee-doo.
4893054	4895916	But, hey, I mean, seriously, why are they doing a top ten list?
4896437	4897818	Stop doing top ten list, people.
4897858	4899680	People that nobody knows.
4899700	4901982	The chat room is naming some other people.
4902222	4904284	Miranda Cosgrove says Sakura Max.
4904864	4905505	Don't know who that is.
4905925	4908547	Olivia Munn says DJ Dark Knight.
4908908	4909428	Don't know who that is.
4910814	4912015	She's on Attack of the Show, right?
4912035	4912995	Diane Miazota.
4914316	4915397	That's what Son of Dad says.
4915997	4916838	Diane Miazota.
4917939	4919440	She doesn't do Cheat anymore, though.
4919660	4921641	Or not Cheat, Filter.
4922201	4926784	She actually does some... Ranma says that's her name.
4926825	4927725	Courtney Thorne-Smith.
4927905	4930507	Courtney Thorne-Smith, that's what it is.
4931388	4931768	Was it a...
4932606	4935329	Makeover show or something like that, like for kids or something.
4935349	4939273	It's like a... Not makeover for kids.
4939313	4939954	Not for kids.
4940054	4942737	It's like... Bam, my kid is ugly, Diane.
4943517	4946420	Not like that, like a room makeover.
4946480	4949283	It's like, you know, trading spaces, but for kids.
4949343	4950465	Oh, I know what you're talking about.
4950505	4951365	I've seen that before.
4951446	4951626	So...
4953348	4954169	No, it's not a makeover.
4954449	4955709	You're too fat to me.
4955750	4957010	You're going to get liposuction.
4981912	4984214	Oh my god, they look like little sluts.
4984474	4989377	I mean, this is a horrible thing to say about seven-year-olds, but who would let their seven-year-old learn these type of dances?
4989437	4991258	I mean, they looked like they were training to become strippers.
4991799	4992319	It was horrible.
4994661	5002506	And I think, I don't remember who it was that said it, but somebody that I was with said something about like, wow, they look like a bunch of little sluts, and one of the kid's parents was right there.
5002526	5005988	And they're like, they turn around and they're like, yes!
5006709	5008130	That's what we wanted.
5009110	5009971	Mission accomplished.
5011486	5011787	Anyhow.
5014195	5014975	Super Smash Bros.
5015076	5015196	Brawl
5044967	5046488	To me, that was a full stage.
5046828	5049070	Let me actually look at the original post here on the dojo.
5050110	5050690	The dojo.
5050710	5051551	About what it is.
5055713	5057134	Oh no, I guess it is the same stage.
5057294	5058334	Yeah, it looks exactly the same.
5058354	5061016	And they also posted the music from the stage there on the website.
5063857	5066939	It's a little bit remixed.
5068139	5068819	Very cool.
5069620	5072801	That's on the smashbrothers.com website.
5073382	5073842	Check that out.
5074622	5076683	All right, well, gosh, Part A is running long tonight.
5076703	5085507	We're almost at an hour and a half, but we want to go ahead and close out Part A here the way we always do, by paying tribute to the classic games of yesteryear.
5086067	5090169	And DarkSakura is not here tonight to do the classic game of the week, but we've been filling in.
5090209	5093051	Last week, I picked a game, Equinox, if you forgot.
5093311	5097273	And this week, Loki's going to pick a game for us as his classic game of the week.
5099894	5101895	Yes, classic game.
5101915	5101935	I...
5103095	5104956	I was torn on what I should pick.
5105516	5106796	Almost picked Dallas Panic.
5108077	5111938	But no, we'll save that for another episode when she's gone as well.
5112439	5120442	This week, I decided to pick a wonderful game that I loved on the Super Nintendo and was also on the Genesis as well.
5120682	5123783	It's a game called Zombies Ate My Neighbors.
5124823	5126724	And it's absolutely awesome.
5126804	5127724	It's very cheesy.
5127744	5130885	It's kind of like a spoof on a bunch of horror films from the 1950s and 60s.
5133384	5137505	It was made by LucasArts, actually published by Konami.
5139586	5141006	Definitely a game you should check out.
5141207	5146648	I wish it would come out on virtual consoles so we can play it again.
5148209	5150489	Tons and tons and tons of different levels you can play.
5150750	5156951	They have squirt guns, grenades, all sorts of things you can fight.
5158192	5161893	Things from giant babies to UFOs, zombies, you name it.
5163172	5163732	Awesome game.
5164653	5165493	Really fun.
5165853	5165993	Yep.
5166194	5167474	I've actually never played this game.
5168035	5168635	No, I really have.
5168655	5170296	This is one of those games I just kind of missed.
5170956	5171876	You need to go do this.
5171936	5172337	I know.
5172877	5174818	Well, then that's why they need to put it out on virtual console.
5175518	5180321	Yeah, you basically run through the stages trying to rescue people and stuff and collect weapons.
5180801	5184883	And then sometimes they'll have you fight different things.
5184923	5187564	And each one of the stages is titled after a movie.
5187604	5188765	It's kind of like a spoof.
5189565	5192807	So they'll have a bunch that are like Night of the Living Dead and stuff like that
5193533	5195514	That's cool, he's freezing the zombies in this one.
5196535	5201538	Yeah, it might sound like it's kind of a generic game, but it's really stylized, and it's, like, really fun.
5201558	5202658	You really just have to play it.
5202678	5204800	It's really an action game.
5205280	5209402	I always hear folks talking about this game, but I've never really seen it in action, so... Oh, there's a little cheerleader.
5209422	5210383	Oh, they have cheerleaders, that's right.
5210443	5212464	So, wait, by running over them, they're saving him or something?
5212664	5213144	Yeah.
5213445	5214685	Oh, I think I remember seeing something like this.
5214705	5216867	Like, he bounces on the trampoline to get over the hedge, right?
5216987	5217047	Yep.
5217067	5217407	Or something?
5218067	5218748	Oh, okay.
5219588	5221149	Can he... Oh, yeah, he's saving that guy.
5221389	5222270	Interesting.
5223593	5225136	Oh, somebody else is bouncing on the trampoline.
5225156	5225937	Well, that's kind of neat.
5227299	5228060	Alright, pretty cool.
5228100	5231405	Zombies Ate My Neighbors, your classic video game of the week.
5231766	5232627	Thank you very much, Loki.
5233949	5234410	Good job.
5234770	5235812	You're welcome.
5237354	5237855	Well, Loki...
5238786	5239846	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5267210	5267951	All segment long.
5267992	5269033	Alright, let's take a break.
