0	21440	Today, December 2nd, 2007, the Wii gets DS demo downloads, Sony swaps out their ad agency,
21440	32240	and DIVX comes to Xbox in the next update.
32240	36240	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge
36240	37240	Radio.
37240	42600	We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer
42600	43720	lifestyle.
43720	48900	For those of you out there who have recently turned to independent radio this week in light
48900	52320	of recent events, a warm welcome from all of us here at OLR.
52320	57640	My name is Rob Roberts, joining me not tonight is the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers,
57640	62000	she is still on vacation, I believe she's coming back to town tonight, we'll see her
62000	66680	back on the show next week, but meanwhile holding down the old fort is the one and only
66680	67680	Loki.
67680	68680	Yes, I'm here.
68680	69680	How you doing?
69680	70680	Good.
70680	71680	Good.
71680	74000	Playing Phantom Hourglass right up until the last second I see.
74000	75000	Yes I am.
75000	77440	But we'll get to your gaming week in just a little bit.
77440	82400	We are joined tonight by the lovely Rice Princess filling in tonight.
82400	83400	Hello.
83400	86440	So it's not just the Rob and Loki show, because otherwise.
86440	88000	It'd be pretty fucking boring.
88000	91040	It might be pretty fucking boring, you put two nerds together and stuff.
91040	92360	So we brought in a third nerd.
92360	93360	So hello Rice Princess.
93360	96380	And then it becomes great, like three nerds makes it better.
96380	99960	I think there was a sitcom, wasn't there, like three nerds, three mics and a pizza place,
99960	101960	I don't know.
101960	106600	Anyhow, I hate that the cam is down this week and I'll talk more about that later because
106600	109280	Irene has the greatest nerdy shirt in the world.
109280	111480	And where'd you, is this something you got from Hot Gothic?
111480	112480	Yeah.
112480	113480	Okay, it's a Metroid shirt.
113480	115520	It's basically the box art from Metroid.
115520	116520	And what does it say?
116520	117520	Can you defeat the mother brain?
117520	118520	Or no, beat the mother brain.
118520	119520	Beat the mother brain.
119520	122200	But you bought me a shirt too from Hot Topic, right?
122200	123200	I did.
123200	124200	I'm so excited.
124200	125200	I love presents.
125200	126200	I'm going to open it.
126200	127200	I haven't actually opened it yet.
127200	128480	So I'm opening it here live on air.
128480	130040	Really sucks that the cam's down this week.
130040	132720	I know, but it's not gaming related at all.
132720	133720	It's not.
133720	134720	It's not gaming related at all.
134720	135720	Oh well.
135720	136720	That's okay.
136720	138280	I'll pretend I didn't see the tag.
138280	139280	Yeah.
139280	140280	You should do that.
140280	141280	Oh my God.
141280	142280	What is it?
142280	144880	Hey, that's awesome.
144880	146880	It's a Pee Wee Herman shirt.
146880	147880	It's cherry.
147880	152600	No, you should turn it over to the front because that's the back, I'm sure.
152600	153600	Oh, Pee Wee's Playhouse.
153600	154600	Oh, that's awesome.
154600	158920	Yeah, it was me at the back that had Pee Wee on cherry.
158920	159920	You're like, wow.
159920	160920	Isn't that a Pee Wee?
160920	161920	It's so exciting.
161920	162920	Pee Wee and cherry.
162920	163920	It's awesome.
163920	164920	I love Pee Wee's Playhouse.
164920	165920	I'm glad you do.
165920	166920	It's great.
166920	168560	Because otherwise that'd be a pretty shitty present.
168560	171920	Otherwise it's like, here's a shirt of a show you don't like.
171920	174160	I just thought you needed new clothes, Rob.
174160	175160	That's great.
175160	176600	I will definitely wear that next week.
176600	178480	Hopefully the cam's back next week.
178480	180880	What happened to the cam, BTW?
180880	182400	I'll talk more about that in a little bit.
182400	183400	Okay.
183400	185520	But let's start it off with how was your gaming week?
185520	186520	Loki wants to start us off tonight.
186520	187520	How was your gaming week?
187520	191920	I didn't play as much as I thought I would be playing this week, but mainly my week was
191920	196480	filled with Phantom Hourglass, and it's fun.
196480	198760	It's a normal Zelda game.
198760	201840	Don't really know what more you'd want.
201840	204560	Sorry, can I interject here for a minute?
204560	205560	Yeah.
205560	207560	I'm looking at our chat room, which I neglected to introduce.
207560	208560	Sorry, chat.
208560	209560	Chat.orangelaunchradio.com.
209560	210560	We love the chat room.
210560	211560	They always crack us up.
211560	216080	And you know how just a little bit ago I was saying, what, three nerds, a mic, and whatever.
216080	222360	DJ Jinai comments, where's the cup?
222360	223360	Get it?
223360	224360	Yeah.
224360	225360	All right, anyway.
225360	226360	Sorry.
226360	227360	Ew.
227360	228360	Delayed reaction.
228360	229360	Yeah.
229360	230360	Totally didn't get it.
230360	234440	You were the one that kept asking me all week long, have you seen the two girls, one cup
234440	235440	thing yet?
235440	237960	I did not ask you.
237960	241480	That's perverted and gross.
241480	244520	Anyway, sorry, Loki.
244520	245520	Anyways.
245520	249160	So yeah, I've been playing Phantom Hourglass and it's fun.
249160	251480	So what else they play?
251480	256200	I tried the Wii version of the Golden Compass because Nellie wanted me to demonstrate the
256200	261240	game for her since she's really into Golden Compass and that's who I got the game for
261240	262240	her.
262240	263640	So it's OK.
263640	265400	It's pretty easy.
265400	268280	But I guess it's based off of a video game, obviously.
268280	269480	Your starts off is...
269480	270480	You mean based off a movie?
270480	272480	Well, yeah, it's based off a movie.
272480	273920	Excellent reviews by the one and only Loki.
273920	275800	It's based off of a book, also.
275800	280680	And you play a giant fucking polar bear that, you know, abuses wolves, apparently.
280680	284420	Because it's like, I kind of feel bad for the wolves because they're attacking you and
284420	287360	you're just like this giant fucking polar bear with armor on it.
287360	292480	It's like, as if, you know, a wolf versus a polar bear was going to win in the first
292480	293480	place.
293480	295080	This bear is fucking tricked out with armor.
295080	296760	There's no fucking way it's going to win.
296760	301080	OK, but like, look at Final Fantasy XI, where like, you could fight a bunny and the bunny
301080	303000	rapes you for 500 points of damage.
303000	304320	I mean, it's...
304320	305840	Sometimes video games don't make sense.
305840	310840	Well, I haven't fought any bunnies yet, but as far as the wolves go, I kick the crap out
310840	313400	of them over and over and over again.
313400	316480	I don't know, you make the Golden Compass sound pretty awesome when you talk about polar
316480	317960	bears and sets of armor.
317960	318960	Well, apparently...
318960	319960	Oh, wait, you don't even know.
319960	324280	I haven't read the book or seen the movie yet, but apparently the characters in this
324280	329560	story have their souls outside of their body as an animal, and the animal like, talks in
329560	332220	the same voice as the girl in the game.
332220	337120	So it's confusing, because it sounds like the girl's having conversations with herself,
337120	341440	and it's like, you know, one will say, yeah, let's do that again, and the girl's like,
341440	342440	I don't want to do that again.
342440	344440	It's like, what the fuck?
344440	345440	Make up your mind.
345440	347840	Maybe she really is talking to herself, and she's crazy.
347840	350480	No, she has this like, panther cat thing on the back.
350480	354680	It looks like a house cat, but apparently it's like a panther or something like that,
354680	360400	and then it can transform into a sloth too, so I don't know, it's some crazy shit.
360400	363900	But I will not be playing any more of that game.
363900	366760	I did play Super Mario Galaxy, though, because I was sick this week.
366760	367760	What did you think of it?
367760	370040	Well, I'm still playing it, and it's fun.
370040	376080	It's very, very, very much like Mario 64, I mean, same kind of setup, just, you know,
376080	377080	no red coins.
377080	389160	Other than that, I don't know, that's pretty much it, I think, from Saints Row, and yeah.
389160	390680	What's so funny about Saints Row?
390680	393280	No, just like, you're playing Saints Row.
393280	395400	Oh, and Earth Defense Force 2017.
395400	396400	Of course.
396400	397400	Still playing some of that.
397400	398400	Of course.
398400	402040	We went and tried to beat the second to last level on Inferno, and that's like getting
402040	404720	raped by thousands of ants at the same time.
404720	406720	It's not very fun.
406720	407720	Nice.
407720	412640	Let's see, my gaming week, I didn't play a whole lot of new stuff, unfortunately, I've
412640	413640	just been very busy.
413640	416400	I've been watching my roommate play a hell of a lot of puzzle quests, though, on Xbox
416400	420480	Live Arcade, which is kind of funny, because he doesn't get into a lot of video games,
420480	424120	but when he does, he definitely puts, he's committed.
424120	426640	So he's been very committed to puzzle quests, he's already at like level 20, he's gotten
426640	428400	way further in the game than I have.
428400	429400	That's crazy.
429400	435760	Yeah, so he's enjoying that, and other than that, I've just been playing the regular World
435760	439840	of Warcraft and Final Fantasy XI, you know, because I just love my MMOs.
439840	440840	Ew.
440840	441840	I know.
441840	445800	I've been playing Rock Band, I went online with Rock Band this week, and I gotta say,
445800	451040	I'm just pissed off that you can't do band co-op mode, I mean, what the hell, why did
451040	452040	they leave that out?
452040	455640	Because you can do band competitive, well, it's not even really competitive, but you
455640	460640	can do like the one song stuff online, like one song at a time, but you can't do the World
460640	465560	Tour mode online, which seems kind of stupid, because it's not like the game's unable to
465560	467580	let four people play online at once.
467580	471560	That was kind of, like, one of the reasons I was excited about Rock Band is I kind of
471560	475880	thought you were going to be able to make these bands together with people from far
475880	476880	away.
476880	479680	Shane, who hasn't been on the show in a long time because he lives in Kansas, also bought
479680	482360	the game, and I was thinking, oh, we could have a band, and we'd play together, it'd
482360	483360	be fun.
483360	486240	But we do have a band already.
486240	493160	A Rock Band, not a real band, where, you know, I play Kazoo, and Irene plays the tambourine.
493160	494800	You know, a Rock Band band.
494800	495800	Anyhow.
495800	496800	Good times.
496800	501960	So I was just pissed that co-op mode was kind of missing in that regard.
501960	505440	Otherwise, they did have a David Bowie pack come out this week, and that was pretty awesome.
505440	506440	Oh, really?
506440	507560	Because David Bowie is very awesome.
507560	508560	He is.
508560	509560	Yes.
509560	510560	There's like a cover of Heroes.
510560	511560	It's good.
511560	512560	Good times.
512560	513560	Nice.
513560	514560	That's really it.
514560	515560	Not a lot else to note.
515560	516560	Not a lot of new games this week.
516560	520000	Oh, I did play Undertow, but I don't know, just not my kind of game.
520000	521000	I wasn't feeling it.
521000	526160	I tried to, it was hard to, I mean, it wasn't hard to figure it out or figure the game out,
526160	530240	but I thought the tutorial could have been a little better, because there was so many
530240	531240	different little features.
531240	535740	I forgot to mention it last week, and it hasn't really been on any of the websites yet, but
535740	542000	they released the Pay the Unlock content for Katamari.
542000	543000	We love Katamari.
543000	545700	Or, not we love Katamari, beautiful Katamari.
545700	550120	And so I bought that, and then afterwards, I'm like, why did I buy that?
550120	552200	That's a good question.
552200	553200	Why did you buy that?
553200	554200	It was an impulse buy.
554200	561440	I bought one of those $20 cards, 1600 point cards, well I didn't buy it per se, I got
561440	569680	crap that I didn't want, and I traded it for a free card, so I can thank a PS3 copy of
569680	576920	Assassin's Creed that bought me Rock Band songs and beautiful Katamari download content.
576920	580720	Sephiroth1215 in our chatroom says Rock Band World Tour wouldn't work online.
580720	581720	Why not?
581720	582720	I don't get it.
582720	583720	It should.
583720	588200	I mean, yeah, I see Black Lab talking about the vocals in the game, how you don't actually
588200	594960	hear the people singing, although you kind of do, but you can have a full band in the
594960	598960	play one song at a time mode co-op, I don't know what it is, just quick play or whatever
598960	604200	it's called, and you can have a guitar, and I actually signed on Xbox Live and got a random
604200	607480	band thrown together where some guy was on vocals, I was on guitar, somebody else was
607480	612880	on bass, and somebody else was on drums, and we could hear the vocalist singing, it was
612880	617800	just a little bit faint and very, very lagged because it was transmitting through his headset
617800	619240	or whatever while he was singing.
619240	621000	Oh, I fucking hate that shit.
621000	623960	Yeah, but the game itself doesn't support that.
623960	626360	It plays the normal backtrack because of the lag.
626360	629360	Hey, that'd be kind of cool if you didn't do the vocal parts without people hearing
629360	630360	you.
630360	631360	I like that idea.
631360	635120	Yeah, if you just turn your headset off, you can do it without people hearing you.
635120	638400	They don't hear you.
638400	641760	Loki has a secret desire to sing a little more often, doesn't he?
641760	642760	No, I don't.
642760	643760	I really don't.
643760	644760	All right.
644760	647600	I have a secret desire to get achievement points, and...
647600	649600	All right.
649600	654080	Rice Princess, have you been playing anything this week at all?
654080	655080	Just WoW, really.
655080	656080	WoW!
656080	657080	How's WoW been going for you?
657080	658080	It's been going excellent.
658080	663600	I was going to deactivate my account, but for some reason I just decided not to, and
663600	667240	then I leveled up like five levels this past week, so...
667240	670560	Wait, WoW's been going great, so you were going to deactivate your account?
670560	675160	No, it was being really boring, and I was like, I'm just using it as a glorified chat
675160	677240	room, and then I was going to deactivate it.
677240	682280	Then I just started leveling, and I was like, wait a minute, I like WoW again.
682280	683280	What's going on?
683280	684920	No, this is kind of fun again.
684920	686160	Yeah, this is weird.
686160	690240	Yeah, because, I don't know, WoW's been kind of boring for the past couple months, but
690240	691240	now it's not.
691240	692800	It's because our guild's too small.
692800	693800	It's kind of sad.
693800	694800	We have no tanks.
694800	695800	We can't run instances together.
695800	696800	We have no tanks.
696800	701840	That's kind of what I think brought me back to playing is that, I don't know, some people
701840	706800	were running me through instances, and I ran people through instances, and we have a guild
706800	708880	bank now, and I'm totally into that.
708880	709880	Guild banks are awesome.
709880	710880	I don't know.
710880	712520	It just became fun again.
712520	713520	Well, good.
713520	714520	Yeah.
714520	715520	All right.
715520	718680	All right, well, let's get into some housekeeping tonight, and then we'll get into the gaming
718680	719680	news.
719680	723760	Obviously, Dark Sakura is not here tonight, but she will be back next week.
723760	728180	Perhaps we'll hear from her later in the show, but I think she's recovering from her trip.
728180	731560	Our webcam, I said I'd say more about this later, Operator 11 is the service that we
731560	736360	use to deliver the webcam feeds of our show, and they're down this week.
736360	741000	They randomly went offline midweek, and then they've come back up with a placeholder page
741000	742920	saying they're down.
742920	746520	So that kind of sucks, but at the same time, you can't really complain because, A, they
746520	749600	were in alpha, so it was an early thing, and B, it's free.
749600	752720	It was very hard to complain about something that's free when it breaks, so we're trying
752720	754160	not to be bitchy.
754160	758520	But if it's not up next week, we probably will look into alternatives for what we can
758520	762560	do to do the cam and everything, because the only bummer about that is that after last
762560	766160	week's show, we finally did the great Zapper challenge.
766160	772520	We had Loki on the regular Wiimote, and I used the Zapper, and we played Link's crossbow
772520	776720	training, and the funny thing that happened is that in the practice round that we played,
776720	778520	I fucking wasted Loki.
778520	780320	My score was 10 times his score.
780320	781320	It was crazy.
781320	784560	I just obliterated him, but it was a practice round.
784560	787440	And then when we did it for reals, Loki beat me by a thousand points.
787440	788440	I was so mad.
788440	793720	So Loki won the great Zapper challenge, proving that the Zapper does nothing to enhance the
793720	794720	gameplay.
794720	797680	And honestly, you playing the Zapper, it was crap, wasn't it?
797680	799400	It wasn't that great.
799400	803940	I can't say the experience was any better with the Zapper, but the crossbow training
803940	805880	game was kind of fun, actually.
805880	810060	To be devil's advocate and a little bit fair here, from what I hear, Ghost Squad, it's
810060	811060	really good.
811060	815080	And the reason why is because they have a good calibration system on it, where you aim
815080	818600	down the Zapper at one corner of the screen, aim down the Zapper at the other corner of
818600	821360	the screen, and then spot on after that.
821360	827520	So I don't know why every game for the Wii doesn't have something like that in the first
827520	828520	place.
828520	829520	Really shouldn't have.
829520	834320	I mean, that should be fucking a default thing to have in there, I mean, come on.
834320	840340	But yeah, so if they add something like that to all the games, it'll be good.
840340	843200	That's one good thing that Ghost Squad has going for it, and hopefully they'll have the
843200	848520	same thing, I assume they'll have the same thing in House of the Dead 2 and 3.
848520	854440	So I mean, the whole thing is only, what, 25 bucks for the Zapper and crossbow training?
854440	859720	Technically $20, but GameStop is ripping everyone off by $5, they're overcharging over retail
859720	860720	for it.
860720	863200	So the Wii mode itself and Link's crossbow training is only 20 bucks?
863200	866760	Well yeah, the Wii Zapper and the Link's crossbow training is only $20 retail.
866760	868400	That's not bad, all things considered.
868400	869440	That really isn't a bad deal.
869440	872640	I mean, granted, the game is probably worth a little more money than, and the game is
872640	876000	short, I mean, it's something you're going to beat pretty quickly, but I think it's,
876000	881280	you know, it's a Wii Sports-ish kind of thing where the game doesn't have a lot of depth,
881280	884240	but you're going to have a lot of people that want to just kind of pick it up and play it
884240	885240	and have fun with it.
885240	887800	Because it's not like the game was that difficult to figure out.
887800	891600	So I thought it was kind of fun.
891600	893100	But that sucks that Loki won the bet.
893100	897640	So no date for me and Loki gets, is the wife going to let me take her out or what?
897640	898640	I don't know.
898640	899640	I'm going to have to talk about that this week.
899640	900640	I think that happened.
900640	902640	So you can have your night of peace.
902640	903640	Yeah.
903640	909960	Anyways, I was going to say for next week, because I have a whole bunch of games on,
909960	913560	you know, I guess a queue to play.
913560	914720	A bunch of import stuff.
914720	920080	Dragon Quest Swords for the Wii, Harvest Moon for the Wii, why the fuck am I going to play
920080	921080	Harvest Moon?
921080	924800	I fucking hate Harvest Moon, but I'm going to try it anyways on the Wii for the hell
924800	928160	of it.
928160	932200	Devil Kings 2 for the Wii, which I hear is really fucking good.
932200	934440	I'm going to try that out.
934440	939320	And then DDR Haas Party for the Wii, the Japanese version, because they have a few different
939320	941600	songs that I want to try out.
941600	945520	And I'm going to do the All Controller Controller Revolution, because it does support the classic
945520	947920	controller to do that, which I didn't know.
947920	954000	I was like, oh, okay, I'll do it that way, because I don't want to buy a dance bet.
954000	959260	And then, I'm trying to think of what else I had, Cruis'n, probably one of the worst
959260	965160	racing games out there, by, you know, screenshots at least, so I'm going to play it to see how
965160	966280	crappy it is.
966280	971280	Then another game that I know is going to be even worse, which is Off-Road Extreme Special
971280	976040	Edition is what it's called, and it's another piece of shit that's coming out there.
976040	978040	I'll play them so you don't have to.
978040	980440	Hey, you know what though?
980440	981440	Crappy games can be good.
981440	987200	In fact, I saw today they have the box shots for the Simple Series 3 and 4 coming out for
987200	989200	the Wii in Japan.
989200	992840	Simple Series 1, I'm also going to be playing Meet-a-Dick Kart Race, another kart racing
992840	993840	game.
993840	995200	So, lots of stuff for next week.
995200	996640	When do we get the WiiWare?
996640	997640	Is that ever going to come out?
997640	998640	I thought that was supposed to come out this year.
998640	999640	I know, I know.
999640	1003720	Oh, and when I get paid this week, I'm going to import Wii Fit.
1003720	1005080	Interesting.
1005080	1006360	And I'm going to use Wii Fit.
1006360	1008240	You must really want to get Wii Fit.
1008240	1009680	I do want to get Wii Fit.
1009680	1010880	Wow, I hope it works for you.
1010880	1013880	I would be very curious to see how Wii Fit works for you.
1013880	1016600	We should make a diary of your progress and all that fun stuff.
1016600	1018000	I think that would be a good idea.
1018000	1019600	Alright, we'll have to get on that.
1019600	1020600	Alright, let's see.
1020600	1025800	Looking in the chat room, DJ Jenai, talking about the Wii, says, I noticed that Nintendo
1025800	1029840	released a game on Virtual Console that Compile made, so maybe it's possible for Nintendo
1029840	1031080	to release the Guardian Legend.
1031080	1032960	God, I only hope so.
1032960	1035080	Those who have been listening to Orange and Andreo for any length of time know that we
1035080	1038840	have a very soft spot in our hearts for the 8-bit classic, the Guardian Legend, so the
1038840	1043720	day that comes out on the Wii, I'm calling in sick to work.
1043720	1044720	Let's see.
1044720	1048600	Odd1 says, the damn system will tell you six ways from Sunday.
1048600	1052280	Don't kill people with your Wii mode and go out once in a while, you fat fuck, on every
1052280	1056800	game, but they don't think to help us calibrate the things to play the game better.
1056800	1061200	And I love that new warnings grant they have, that thing looks like a fucking condom on
1061200	1062200	there.
1062200	1063200	I'm sorry.
1063200	1064200	It is the ugliest.
1064200	1065200	With the Wii condom.
1065200	1066200	It is the ugliest thing.
1066200	1067200	You know what?
1067200	1068400	I'm playing fucking dangerously, okay?
1068400	1073300	I don't use the wrist strap, and even if I did, I have the original wrist strap.
1073300	1075040	No fucking condom on it, man.
1075040	1078720	I'm living dangerously.
1078720	1081400	You're playing your Wii promiscuously.
1081400	1082400	You bad boy.
1082400	1087720	It's all skin against skin with my Wii there.
1087720	1088720	Nice.
1088720	1089720	Wow.
1089720	1093520	Oh, Dillinger's been playing a game I really want to play.
1093520	1094520	Trauma Center New Blood.
1094520	1096400	I need to go out and get that game.
1096400	1097400	Yes you do.
1097400	1098400	Trauma Center.
1098400	1099400	I can take it from you and play it.
1099400	1100400	No.
1100400	1101400	Yes.
1101400	1102400	My game.
1102400	1103400	You can't take my game.
1103400	1104400	Yeah, I can.
1104400	1105400	Do you want to borrow something else on Wii?
1105400	1106400	Sure.
1106400	1107400	Like Metroid or something?
1107400	1108400	I don't know.
1108400	1109400	No.
1109400	1110400	Not fucking Metroid.
1110400	1111400	What?
1111400	1112400	You sure it says Metroid on it.
1112400	1113400	It says old school Metroid, damn it.
1113400	1118080	I don't want to play no damn 3D Metroid, that blasphemous piece of crap.
1118080	1119760	I mean, Metroid's great.
1119760	1123240	AZHP says Trauma Center New Blood is the best game ever.
1123240	1124240	Shut up.
1124240	1125240	Interesting.
1125240	1127240	I mean, it's okay that you said that, but I want to play it.
1127240	1130240	I guess that's it for housekeeping.
1130240	1134080	I don't have a lot else to add, so let's get into some, oh, actually one quick thing is
1134080	1137600	that there's like a 90% chance next week, I know I've been saying this for a while now,
1137600	1142240	but we'll finally be out in the actual studio for those keeping track.
1142240	1146240	We've been in our temporary studio, quote unquote, for like the past three months, but
1146240	1150400	I'm hoping next week, just due to some things that are going around in the personal life,
1150400	1153000	we're going to try and get out there next week.
1153000	1156080	I'm very excited about it, which is why I really want the cam to come back.
1156080	1162040	So if Op11's not back next week, we're probably going to look into either Justin.tv or Ustream.
1162040	1167160	I really haven't thought about what else is a good service, because I kind of liked how
1167160	1169040	Op11 had the episodic stuff.
1169040	1171640	But anyhow, let's get into gaming news.
1171640	1172640	Loki.
1172640	1177120	Anyways, the thing that everybody's been talking about this week is a certain GameStop editor
1177120	1182800	was rumored to have been fired for a negative review over Kane and Lynch.
1182800	1191320	Anyways, the person responsible for this, I can't remember his name, they just have
1191320	1196920	his last name up here, anyways, and I don't even know how to pronounce that, Gershwin,
1196920	1197920	I guess?
1197920	1201880	I want to see if it's like a, anyways, Jeff Gershwin, yes.
1201880	1208400	Anyways, so the rumor is, because no one's coming out to say otherwise, the rumor is
1208400	1213900	this is because of his negative review on Kane and Lynch, Eidos threatened to pull the
1213900	1219920	ad support, because they have the whole fucking site skinned like Kane and Lynch, and because
1219920	1227440	of that, since the ads pay their salaries, basically, rather than lose them as a ad supporter,
1227440	1230880	they fired him instead.
1230880	1236920	And everybody is just up in arms, because now people have finally figured out, hey,
1236920	1245560	guess what, maybe ad contributions from publishers and stuff affect scores of games.
1245560	1246560	Really?
1246560	1247560	You think?
1247560	1248560	Hmm?
1248560	1249560	You're kidding.
1249560	1251440	Wow, welcome to the real world, folks.
1251440	1257120	Anyways, so yeah, tons of stuff, in fact, I think there were some other people that
1257120	1261080	also got fired too, at least there's one other person I know that got fired and I think other
1261080	1266160	people are talking about leaving, but yeah, it's a big mess right now.
1266160	1275840	Hmm, okay, you know, can I be honest, this guy is, okay, I'll lie, I've totally known
1275840	1279520	about this guy and followed his career for a long, long time, is that a good lie?
1279520	1280520	No.
1280520	1284680	Okay, here's the truth, I had no idea who the hell this guy was until I read this article
1284680	1287680	on the internet, apparently he's been some respected game journalist for the past ten
1287680	1294160	years, but honestly, I don't read a lot of corporate sites, so I don't, there's a lot
1294160	1298200	of independent blogs I read and maybe some of them are somewhat corporate because I read
1298200	1302920	Joystiq, they're AOL, Kotaku, whatever, but I don't really read a lot of the big box sites
1302920	1303920	very often.
1303920	1306720	I used to read one up maybe like three years ago, I don't really read them a lot anymore
1306720	1310600	either, so I had no idea who the hell this guy was.
1310600	1315200	Nevertheless, I can't help but think, so I'm trying to look at this as objectively as possible
1315200	1319840	because I can't help but think, and this may not be the popular opinion, but I actually
1319840	1323060	think there's a bit of mob mentality going on here.
1323060	1329200	I think the gaming scene is jumping to a lot of conclusions with this stuff, when there's
1329200	1333800	a lot of people that really can't talk about what's going on in this situation, and I think
1333800	1337680	there's been quite a bit of jumping to conclusions and things that have probably gotten blown
1337680	1338680	out of proportions.
1338680	1339680	Oh yeah.
1339680	1343360	And the interesting thing about it, I mean honestly, these companies involved are kind
1343360	1349440	of screwed because of it, and it's kind of alarming, I think if anything, from this what
1349440	1356960	we're learning is that the video game scene can be very sensationalist sometimes, in some
1356960	1357960	regards.
1357960	1358960	This isn't the first time this stuff's happened.
1358960	1359960	Not really, no.
1359960	1366160	I mean, first off, people give him crap anyways because he had that, you know, non-ten review
1366160	1367600	on Twilight Princess.
1367600	1371920	Listen, if I were to review Twilight Princess, it wouldn't fucking get a ten, okay?
1371920	1376700	Seriously, that game is not God's gift to fucking gaming, seriously, it's just a fucking
1376700	1380960	Zelda game, just like Phantom Hourglass is a fucking Zelda game, they're good, but they're
1380960	1382860	never great, okay?
1382860	1383860	So whatever.
1383860	1386000	I digress, but whatever, that's- Anyways.
1386000	1387000	Everybody's allowed to have their own opinion, that's fine.
1387000	1391240	I'm just saying, you know, everybody was fucking, like, giving Zelda a fucking blowjob or some
1391240	1394160	shit like that, it is goddamn just a game.
1394160	1395160	Anyways.
1395160	1398480	I don't know, it kind of deserved at least a handjob, I mean it was a really good game.
1398480	1399860	Oh absolutely, yeah.
1399860	1402720	It was not that great of a game, seriously.
1402720	1404080	Wind Waker is a better game.
1404080	1405960	Whoa, that's crossing the line.
1405960	1408520	Oh wow, yeah, no, you did not just go there.
1408520	1409520	Ouch.
1409520	1410520	Alright, back on topic.
1410520	1411520	Anyways.
1411520	1413880	I mean, does anyone remember Driver 3?
1413880	1417720	How the whole story came out that people were, that Atari was paying for good reviews on
1417720	1418720	that game?
1418720	1421880	I mean, this isn't the first time, this isn't the last time this is going to happen, I'm
1421880	1428680	sure it's happened hundreds of times between those, so I'm not surprised, it's just people
1428680	1433640	are finally figuring it out, that this is going on behind the scenes.
1433640	1437480	And to be honest, people don't really know why this guy was let go.
1437480	1441540	I mean, think about it, just hypothetically, the company, and again, I don't know shit
1441540	1444240	about what's going on in this situation, I'm not going to pretend like I know what's going
1444240	1447480	on in this situation, I just know what I'm reading out there on the internet, what people
1447480	1453260	were saying, and hypothetically, in the corporate world, they could have fired this guy because
1453260	1454960	he was late to work too many times.
1454960	1455960	Yep.
1455960	1456960	Who knows?
1456960	1459280	Okay, does it confirm that he was fired?
1459280	1460280	He did not quit?
1460280	1461280	He was laid off?
1461280	1464120	Well, he was basically locked out of his office.
1464120	1470900	But again, that's all talk, but you feel like there is some validity to that, because obviously
1470900	1476520	employees of the company are stepping forward anonymously and saying these things, so he
1476520	1477520	was fired.
1477520	1478520	Okay.
1478520	1480440	He'd been at the company for like 10 years.
1480440	1484620	But anyhow, I've seen people in the corporate world work at a company for like 10, 15 years
1484620	1489080	and get fired over a really bad thing or whatever goes on, so who knows?
1489080	1492720	This guy could have been like late to work for an entire month or something.
1492720	1495000	Again, I'm being very hypothetical.
1495000	1499760	And the company could fire him, but the company can't say why they fired him.
1499760	1502920	And if he gets fired over something like that, is he going to say, oh yeah, they fired me
1502920	1505620	because I was late to work too many times?
1505620	1507880	Or is he going to let people draw their own conclusions?
1507880	1513200	He probably also can't, well, I'm not even really saying that, I think he can't actually
1513200	1515520	say why he was fired.
1515520	1518300	I think he has to sign something when he's leaving.
1518300	1521080	This is why, you know, you're not allowed to say that.
1521080	1524400	Okay, so he has to sign something or what?
1524400	1527200	It's probably actually something he signed when he was, in confidentiality agreements
1527200	1530840	he signed when he started with the company, not when he was leaving.
1530840	1534400	Oh, sign this, you can't tell anyone why you're fired if we fire you.
1534400	1536040	Well, I don't know.
1536040	1539920	I think he can say why he's fired, he probably just didn't want to yet.
1539920	1541200	I don't know.
1541200	1547000	Well, I don't think he would purposefully do that because then they could, I don't know.
1547000	1550600	It's not really slander, I guess, but...
1550600	1556280	I'm pretty sure this is going on, I mean, it's just, sure it could be all these things,
1556280	1558280	but it just smells a little fishy to me.
1558280	1562500	The gut side of me says, I mean, where there's smoke there's fire, right?
1562500	1566360	The gut side of me tells me there is some validity to this, and I think one theory I
1566360	1571040	read somewhere that makes a lot of sense is that they wanted to change wording in the
1571040	1576440	review to make it more accurate as to whatever would the change were between the Xbox 360
1576440	1582880	and PlayStation 3 were, and he didn't want to do that, and he got let go for being somewhat
1582880	1587640	of a difficult person on this and other issues in the past, and that, you know, because the
1587640	1591880	wording got changed, the internet changed that into, you know, the great game of internet
1591880	1597920	telephone, that got changed into, oh my gosh, he refused to change the article to give it
1597920	1600360	a good score, so Eidos made them fire him.
1600360	1604440	Okay, so why didn't they just not publish the review?
1604440	1608400	Why didn't they just, like, say, hey, okay, well, this is not in line with what we're
1608400	1612520	looking for, we're not going to publish it, I mean, I know he could just as easily go
1612520	1616800	to his own personal blog and post it or whatever, but that's his own personal blog, they don't
1616800	1617800	have jurisdiction on it.
1617800	1621200	Well, the thing is, though, is they use a lot of these reviews as advertising for their
1621200	1622200	game as well.
1622200	1625960	I mean, that's why you see them boxes, you know, games where I gave it a five out of
1625960	1630920	five or ten out of ten or whatever, you know, they use that shit in the fucking commercials,
1630920	1637560	they use it in, you know, their press advertisements and all that stuff, it's a big deal for them
1637560	1643560	if, you know, they're paying, you know, GameSpot, you know, like, say, a million dollars for,
1643560	1647680	like, advertising or something like that, and then all of a sudden, they get a shitty
1647680	1652800	ass review out of it and it causes people not to buy the game, what's going to incentivize
1652800	1656160	them to give them more money when they can give it to some other site that's going to
1656160	1657560	give it a more favorable review?
1657560	1662560	Yeah, but if they don't publish it from that particular journalist, can't they just get
1662560	1665240	one of their other journalists to publish a positive review?
1665240	1669040	Yeah, but then it's going to come out that this guy had wrote a review on it and then
1669040	1673400	all of a sudden, oh, wait a second, there's, you know, they didn't print it because this
1673400	1674460	one's more favorable.
1674460	1677480	It would come out one way or another.
1677480	1680840	I just think that's a little far to be going, like, oh, we're going to fire you because
1680840	1681840	you gave a bad review.
1681840	1685360	And also, because they have deadlines, you know, when these reviews need to get out there,
1685360	1690200	and they may not have time to, you know, it takes time to play through the game and be
1690200	1691520	able to review it correctly.
1691520	1696800	Granted, there are also rumors of people just writing reviews without playing the game.
1696800	1698640	That happens too.
1698640	1703840	Odd1 has a very interesting, and obviously our chat room is lit up with this, chat.orangehouseradio.com.
1703840	1708500	Odd1 says, but seriously, who here was really looking forward to Kane and Lynch?
1708500	1710480	Where the fuck was the hype for that recently?
1710480	1711480	We're kind of swamped.
1711480	1714720	I doubt even GameSpot's words could make it a million seller.
1714720	1719600	Let's see, what else do we have here?
1719600	1722520	Raven's Dolphin says, I heard he got fired of the video review.
1722520	1725480	Well, maybe, but again, this is all hearsay.
1725480	1731400	GZDr4ev says, people canceled their GameSpot accounts, yet people are leaving the site
1731400	1735440	en masse over this whole thing, but again, I partially blame mob mentality for why that's
1735440	1739160	happening because people don't really know what's going on yet, but people are making
1739160	1742780	up stories that sure seem to make a lot of sense.
1742780	1746720	Frisbee says, but if the game sucks, then the players will get the truth out there.
1746720	1747720	Absolutely.
1747720	1749920	Which I think just goes to show the lesson learned here.
1749920	1755560	If you are getting all your gaming news and reviews from one person on one corporate gaming
1755560	1760400	site, you might need to take off the blinders.
1760400	1764560	If you're looking for accurate reviews on stuff, don't rely on one website.
1764560	1767520	You can go to websites like Metacritic.
1767520	1773600	They've got a compilation of scores from all sorts of sites and stuff, and that'll give
1773600	1780640	you a good baseline of what the game is, and also you can read review and see what it is.
1780640	1781640	Wait a minute.
1781640	1785840	Did Metacritic pay you money for that low-key, for that endorsement?
1785840	1789800	I just happened to use that site because it compiles reviews.
1789800	1790800	Anyways.
1790800	1791800	Fired!
1791800	1794240	I don't get paid for shit, okay?
1794240	1795240	Seriously.
1795240	1797680	Yeah, you're right about that.
1797680	1802920	The truth be told now, because at work we sell Kane & Lynch and stuff, and Kane & Lynch
1802920	1808000	is one of those titles that was kind of a, what we call select style, it's a title we
1808000	1812000	push because we're getting paid money to push the title a little bit.
1812000	1817520	The thing is though, Eidos set our goal so high it was impossible to hit anyways so that
1817520	1822720	it wouldn't have to pay out any money to us, because we had people that make these deals
1822720	1826200	are fucking retarded or something.
1826200	1829960	But yeah, they have a lot of, I mean, Eidos is really pushing to make this game big.
1829960	1834720	I mean, doing it in little ways I probably wouldn't, you know, they're advertising, marketing
1834720	1839920	people, little creative ways like, you know, teaming up with Playboy, for example, to do
1839920	1841640	that model search.
1841640	1847460	They had interviews with the fake characters in the game in Playboy.
1847460	1849040	They did reach out to the independent media.
1849040	1852400	They flew a bunch of them out there to San Francisco to go.
1852400	1855440	We weren't invited, and we could just drive there, but that's okay.
1855440	1856440	We're not bitter.
1856440	1857440	Oh yeah, sure.
1857440	1862240	You know, because we drive there, you know, that's why they don't invite us to this stuff.
1862240	1863240	Bastards.
1863240	1865240	Anyways, you know.
1865240	1870520	But I also think there's definitely a certain type of audience I think this show caters
1870520	1871520	to.
1871520	1875000	I mean, granted, I think we have people from all walks of gaming that listen to this program,
1875000	1879560	but I think people know that we are mostly the one you want to hear for the music, the
1879560	1880560	RPGs.
1880560	1884920	There's a certain niche that Kane & Lynch doesn't fit into, I think.
1884920	1886760	Listen, I'm not saying Kane & Lynch is a bad game.
1886760	1888240	It probably could have been a good game, but this...
1888240	1889240	I've never played it.
1889240	1890240	I don't know.
1890240	1892800	I haven't played it either, but you know, just from whatever I've been reading and the
1892800	1899360	way it looks, to me, this game's kind of fallen into the same problem that, you know, Black
1899360	1905000	Sight Area 51 and some of these other games have gotten in their rush to make it out for
1905000	1906000	Christmas.
1906000	1909920	And this year, I think also next year, you're going to see a lot of these games that are
1909920	1913560	going to be spread out throughout the year instead of all in November, and that might
1913560	1918840	help some of these games, you know, because like Army of Two, for example, that one was
1918840	1924480	going to be released in November as well along with Kane & Lynch and all this other stuff,
1924480	1925520	but it wasn't done yet.
1925520	1929880	And so instead of releasing it, they're putting more time into polishing it and making sure
1929880	1933760	that it's a good game before they release it, and so now it's coming out later on.
1933760	1937080	It missed, you know, the holiday thing, but it's going to be a better game.
1937080	1942440	Same with like, you know, Grand Theft Auto IV, Metal Gear Solid IV, you know, stuff like
1942440	1943440	that.
1943440	1947280	Take the extra time and make the game good, and then that way you will get a better score
1947280	1953920	for it instead of rushing this piece of shit out and then having to be broken.
1953920	1956840	Here's the other thing that kind of makes me think there's more than meets the eye with
1956840	1958000	this whole thing.
1958000	1961120	Is a 6 out of 10 a bad review?
1961120	1965160	I mean, I realize the way the scale has been kind of skewed over the years by many people,
1965160	1970700	I guess yes, but I always thought a 5 was average, like right in the middle you're average,
1970700	1976520	so a 5 is average, so technically a score of 6 is a slightly above average game.
1976520	1977520	Right?
1977520	1978520	True.
1978520	1981680	And it wouldn't be that bad if it were in a month that was, you know, a bit slower with
1981680	1985800	games, but this is November where you have, you know, 60 billion releases coming out,
1985800	1991040	and a 6 game may not be played by as many people as, say, but here's what you need to
1991040	1992040	do though.
1992040	1995200	I'm not sure if the game's going to be good, I'm also just trying to take a jab at the
1995200	1998760	fact that most games in this day and age are rated on a scale of 5 to 10, not a scale of
1998760	1999760	1 to 10.
1999760	2000760	7 to 10.
2000760	2006520	No, but seriously though, if you're unsure the games can be good, rent it.
2006520	2012320	I mean, rent it from Gamefly, rent it from your local Blockbuster, Hollywood, whoever,
2012320	2015240	you know, rent it and see if it's any good.
2015240	2020680	Shadowslier wants to give insight on that, he says, on the GameSpot scale a 6.0 is fair.
2020680	2026040	Okay, but fair is not a bad word, it's not a good word either, it's just a fair word.
2026040	2029720	There really is no better description for that.
2029720	2034120	See, I don't even really like scale-based reviews in the first place, because then you
2034120	2038320	just put all your trust, you're like having them make the decision for you.
2038320	2041280	Like Loki said, just rent the game if you're so unsure about it.
2041280	2045080	I mean, if it catches your eye in the first place, read the review, then go rent it, but
2045080	2047440	if not, then I wouldn't even worry about it.
2047440	2049200	Like, numbers are nothing.
2049200	2054720	There are games that most of the critics out there on the internet have given fair scores
2054720	2059160	to, such as I think Eternal Sonata was a game that got mostly sevens and stuff.
2059160	2061160	I freaking love that game, that game was incredible.
2061160	2063480	This is only one person's opinion on it.
2063480	2067640	You're basing your entire, whether you're going to play this game or not, on one person's
2067640	2068640	opinion.
2068640	2074120	I mean, God, it's not like this was reviewed by a panel of scientists or something like
2074120	2078240	that, where they had thousands of people playing this game and this is the score they came
2078240	2079240	up with.
2079240	2082880	It's one dude, whether he likes the game or not, he may just hate Eidos or something,
2082880	2087120	they may have rubbed them the wrong way before, and now he's embittered and now it's a six
2087120	2089880	or something because they fucking pissed him off.
2089880	2093200	Or like, you know, if I reviewed Madden or something like that, I don't like fucking
2093200	2095440	football games, one, or something like that.
2095440	2098800	I mean, that's the kind of, you're supposed to be unbiased when you're playing this stuff,
2098800	2103000	but you know, it's, what, I'm actually kind of curious, what do you think about the fact
2103000	2109280	that, you know, after all this, the competitors down the street at 1UP did this little protest
2109280	2113200	or something on their lunch, this whole, like, kind of, you know, having the signs Free Jeff
2113200	2114680	and whatever all that stuff was.
2114680	2115680	What do you think of that?
2115680	2117960	Because I certainly have an opinion on it.
2117960	2120040	Fucking attention whores is what that is.
2120040	2121360	This is bullshit.
2121360	2122360	Interesting.
2122360	2127480	The same fucking shit's going on over at 1UP where most of the, you know, most of the internet
2127480	2131040	would say the exact, what a great sign of support these guys are doing on their lunch
2131040	2132040	break.
2132040	2133360	This isn't going to support shit.
2133360	2137680	All they're doing is just fucking, you know, oh, let's do this because, okay, if they were
2137680	2142200	doing it genuinely and, you know, it was to support them, they wouldn't have put it in
2142200	2145400	their fucking Flickr and then posted that shit everywhere.
2145400	2149400	This is, you know, it's just like those fucking tobacco companies, oh, we donated a million
2149400	2153840	dollars to this charity, praise us for doing some good.
2153840	2154840	Fuck that.
2154840	2155840	Interesting.
2155840	2158800	You know, other people, if they noticed it or something like that and posted it in their
2158800	2162880	fucking Flickr blogs, then it would be good, but the fact that they're, like, promoting
2162880	2165360	themselves, look at what we did, we're so awesome.
2165360	2166360	No, fuck that.
2166360	2167360	I'm not, wow.
2167360	2170280	Oh, we're going to get some angry e-mails this week.
2170280	2172720	Mailbag at orangehonstroyer.com.
2172720	2176720	Here's the thing is that I don't know what the motivation is, whatever, I'm not going
2176720	2181640	to pretend to know, but I do think it was a little premature because, again, I find
2181640	2185500	that a little strange that they would jump in on that mob mentality when none of us truly
2185500	2187400	know what's going on.
2187400	2190960	And they have waited until more news came out when, I mean, these guys do represent
2190960	2196080	a corporation, so that's my only, like, I don't know if that was smart type of thing.
2196080	2199680	Wait, so it was a bunch of employees from one up, like, during their lunch break.
2199680	2202200	I think that there's reviewers and critics over there.
2202200	2203200	Yeah.
2203200	2204200	Yeah, Ziff Davis or whatever.
2204200	2205200	During their lunch break?
2205200	2206200	Oh, yeah, something like that.
2206200	2209280	I mean, you can't control what somebody, that's right, they can do whatever the hell they
2209280	2210280	want.
2210280	2213600	But here's the thing, though, and I, what were they, you know, protesting that they
2213600	2218520	support independent reviews or unbiased reviews or something like that, so what they're basically
2218520	2223780	saying is that they support that so that one up has unbiased reviews.
2223780	2226080	That's the impression that you're supposed to get from that.
2226080	2229800	It's just fucking advertising for themselves is all it is.
2229800	2232800	I'm sorry, I don't see it as very genuine at all.
2232800	2238040	All I see that is is, hey, some manager came up with an idea to have them go out during
2238040	2241040	their lunch break and fucking protest in front of them.
2241040	2245080	No, I don't believe this shit, that they're such a tight-knit group or whatever, that
2245080	2246600	they would do that kind of crap.
2246600	2250800	But hold on, hold on, hold on, the few times we have been to these media events and things
2250800	2256600	like that, it's always the same fucking people, so I think in some regard they are somewhat
2256600	2257600	of a family.
2257600	2261240	Okay, okay, let's say that they're a tight-knit group, okay, if I fucking got fired, say that
2261240	2265440	we were corporate or whatever, and I got fired because, you know, I wrote a bad review on
2265440	2269120	Kane and Lynch, would fucking one up be on my lawn protesting for that shit?
2269120	2273080	No, they would be there twiddling their thumbs in their office going, ah, those fuckers that
2273080	2275080	like DDR serves them right.
2275080	2277940	I mean, seriously, that's the shit that would happen.
2277940	2282000	This is not fucking, you know, advertising or anything like that.
2282000	2288480	It's just, it, I'm sorry, I saw that, I'm like, oh, come on, seriously.
2288480	2292480	And then I read it on every single blog, I got the same thing, oh, good one up, go them.
2292480	2296400	I'm like, fuck that shit, I'm going there less now because of this.
2296400	2300280	I'm going there less now, 25% less because of that, like.
2300280	2304760	Yeah, let's see their, I bet you that fucking protest shit's in their goddamn EGM, too.
2304760	2310480	How much you want to bet that shit is, oh, they're so, so independent and awesome that,
2310480	2311480	you know, and unbiased.
2311480	2312480	Let's put it in our magazine, too.
2312480	2313480	Look how holy we are.
2313480	2316880	You know, I just realized I have Tuesday off work.
2316880	2322000	Maybe I should go down there with a sign that says, thank you for firing him.
2322000	2324260	Orange Lounge Radio.
2324260	2326920	Those fuckers who like DDR.
2326920	2327920	Just to see what happens.
2327920	2328920	No, I'm kidding.
2328920	2329920	I have better things to do on Tuesday.
2329920	2330920	No, you don't.
2330920	2331920	Go down there.
2331920	2332920	No, I'm going to see the Spice Girls.
2332920	2333920	What are you talking about?
2333920	2334920	You said you had better things to do.
2334920	2336080	I have much better things to do on Tuesday.
2336080	2337080	Whatever.
2337080	2340760	Okay, let's just, you know, okay, the fact of the matter is, okay, we don't know why
2340760	2341760	he was fired.
2341760	2343120	We assume it's because of this.
2343120	2346320	Yeah, this is going on in the industry, big whoop, you know, other things going on in
2346320	2347320	the industry, too.
2347320	2352960	Like, I don't know, certain media outlets getting to break street on certain news stories
2352960	2357800	and stuff like that or no such embargo for them because, you know, they make a lot of
2357800	2359440	money in advertising and that kind of thing.
2359440	2360920	Yeah, that kind of stuff happens as well.
2360920	2364480	There's a whole lot of shit you don't see that happens behind the scene, you know, day
2364480	2368580	to day but, you know, we all deal with it and guess what, things aren't going to change
2368580	2370280	so get over it.
2370280	2374040	And really, in a month, who's going to be fucking talking about this?
2374040	2375040	Who's going to give a shit?
2375040	2376040	Nobody.
2376040	2378680	If you want genuine reviews, ask someone that's actually played a damn game.
2378680	2379680	Your friends.
2379680	2380680	Irene, I don't know.
2380680	2384840	I do think there is going to be some type of long lasting effect this whole thing has
2384840	2388880	because I think people are going to, I think companies are going to watch what happens
2388880	2392760	to the whole rah, rah, rah, my mentality, we hate you, GameSpot type thing that goes
2392760	2398300	on and I think there's going to be a lot of, you're going to see, I think the big sites
2398300	2401960	post about their integrity, like I think you're going to see the competitors like OneUp and
2401960	2406280	IGM make things about their integrity in their reviews and their corporate policies.
2406280	2413720	Well, wait a minute, let's revert back to an old situation that concerned, you know,
2413720	2418840	mishandling or mistreatment of employees at a gaming establishment.
2418840	2421760	Like look at, what was it, the EA spouse?
2421760	2424040	How long did we talk about that?
2424040	2427680	You know, the EA spouse that was like, oh, my husband's working too long or whatever
2427680	2429480	lasted about a month.
2429480	2434760	Yeah, they've raised issues of like, you know, oh, you know, look at them, they're evil and
2434760	2437800	blah, blah, blah, blah, but people still go and work for them.
2437800	2439280	People still buy their games.
2439280	2444320	No one's really like EA did not go under as a company, like no one gives a shit anymore.
2444320	2445760	Like did they put a hit on her?
2445760	2449160	I mean, I don't know because nobody talks about it anymore.
2449160	2450160	How the fuck do I know?
2450160	2451160	No, I think I remember seeing it.
2451160	2452160	I know I'm just teasing obviously.
2452160	2456000	I think I remember seeing a story like a year ago, like she was unmasked and we found out
2456000	2458240	who she really was and all this stuff.
2458240	2462600	Also writing reviews and then the companies can start paying me because I need money.
2462600	2467640	No, but seriously, though, I mean, if I had the free time, I'd write reviews, but I don't
2467640	2468640	have the fucking free time.
2468640	2472840	I have to work and then have a wife that I want to go home and a cat that wants me to
2472840	2473840	play with it.
2473840	2476960	So, you know, I have to do these things.
2476960	2477960	I can't write reviews.
2477960	2481200	Do you want me to put a hit out on your cat?
2481200	2482200	Maybe my wife, but.
2482200	2483200	Are you like?
2483200	2484200	Wow.
2484200	2485200	Wow.
2485200	2486200	That was mean.
2486200	2487200	Dang.
2487200	2488200	Oh, snap.
2488200	2489200	Is that Freudian?
2489200	2490200	Was that intentional?
2490200	2494120	I'm using opinions expressed on this program.
2494120	2495840	Let's see.
2495840	2498200	The chat room has been lining up and I've been ignoring them.
2498200	2499200	Sorry, guys.
2499200	2501560	Odd One says, I don't know, did I already read this one?
2501560	2502880	I think, I don't think I did.
2502880	2506400	I think the developers give the gaming press more credit than they're worth, especially
2506400	2507760	in the face of the internet.
2507760	2508760	The word gets out.
2508760	2509760	We have our ears to the ground.
2509760	2513960	Yes, you can get exclusive news from the corporate sites, but the message boards, podcasts and
2513960	2515580	indie sites are where it's at.
2515580	2520120	If Eidos was stupid enough to push this, seriously, I'd love to see them burn.
2520120	2524520	I have a feeling actually, I have kind of a strange feeling, Eidos has nothing to do
2524520	2525520	with this.
2525520	2528440	I think maybe they were like, they were probably a little pissed and they probably let GameSpot
2528440	2532320	know that, but you know, they also probably kind of realized that there wasn't a lot they
2532320	2533320	could do about it.
2533320	2534320	So, I don't know.
2534320	2538400	I have a feeling if anybody's probably getting a bad rap over this, actually probably them.
2538400	2539400	I don't know.
2539400	2541400	It's just kind of one of my gut tells me about this whole mom mentality thing.
2541400	2542600	Yeah, I don't think they had much to do with it.
2542600	2545600	I don't think they can directly say, fire this person.
2545600	2550720	I mean, if it was EA maybe, you know, maybe, but I mean, we're talking Eidos here, what,
2550720	2553240	Tomb Raider, Hitman.
2553240	2554240	That's it.
2554240	2555240	I mean, seriously.
2555240	2559520	Gerardimo says, dear world, go get your own opinion and decide if the game is good or
2559520	2561020	not yourself.
2561020	2564880	Mac Man says, I like the idea from All Games Interactive, sound effect reviews.
2564880	2569000	Okay, this game is audience laughter out of Mario Jump.
2569000	2572360	That's brilliant.
2572360	2573520	Let's see.
2573520	2577480	Tiger Claw in response to the 1UP protest says, maybe it's a sign that 1UP would like
2577480	2578880	Gertzmann to work for them.
2578880	2579880	Who knows?
2579880	2582480	Odd1 says, Ziff is all about the publicity.
2582480	2583840	They're good with Flickr and all that shit.
2583840	2587320	I'm not surprised they videotape almost everything they do.
2587320	2590360	Let's see.
2590360	2595600	Yeah, I don't see Eidos pressuring them to fire this guy.
2595600	2599560	I mean, EA or something, like if they gave Madden like a really shitty score or something
2599560	2603800	like that, because they're a big company and have a lot of money to throw around, but...
2603800	2609680	Eidos, I mean, what, would they have come out recently, Tomb Raider Anniversary Edition?
2609680	2610680	I mean...
2610680	2613240	All right, well, we've spent a lot of time talking about this topic.
2613240	2617600	We want to move on to some other news, but I'm sure we'll hear a lot about this on the
2617600	2622560	Skype line later, and of course, there always is our mailbag at orangeonsradio.com.
2622560	2627240	Meanwhile, more news, and let's talk about the Virtual Console on the Wii.
2627240	2629480	We'll start off with some Wii news tonight.
2629480	2630600	This is great news.
2630600	2635960	This makes me think Nintendo finally gets it, what we really want, in a way.
2635960	2641120	Pokemon Snap is coming out on the Wii's Virtual Console in Japan, and usually this would be
2641120	2647280	no big deal, however, the pictures that you take inside the game, you can now post to
2647280	2651040	your Wii message board and send around on the address book.
2651040	2655040	So if you've taken a picture of Pikachu doing a little dance or something, and you think
2655040	2660240	it's really cute, I could send that over to the Wii that Rice Princess has and make her
2660240	2661240	look at it.
2661240	2662240	No, you won't.
2662240	2663240	I just might.
2663240	2664240	I'll just delete it.
2664240	2665840	I'll befriend you, if that's possible.
2665840	2670760	Now, I think a lot of us have been shouting for the mountaintops for years, well, at least
2670760	2672320	years, since the Wii came out.
2672320	2678420	We want to see additional functionality in the Virtual Console games, like online play
2678420	2679740	and things like this.
2679740	2683520	So the fact that they've done this for Pokemon Snap shows that it's possible, right?
2683520	2686400	Why did they have to do it with Pokemon Snap?
2686400	2689320	God damn it, why couldn't they pick a better game to do it with?
2689320	2692000	Like nobody gives a shit about taking pictures of stupid Pokemon.
2692000	2694960	Hey, I love Pokemon Snap, shut up.
2694960	2698600	Yeah, well, it's stupid, and you're stupid.
2698600	2707160	Anyways, Odd1 says, message board posts of Pokemon in near sexual positions up 500%.
2707160	2709400	Pokemon Snap has now become Pokemon Slash.
2709400	2712480	Good job, everybody.
2712480	2715880	Of course they're making a lot of money off of Pokemon Snap and other Virtual Console
2715880	2716880	titles.
2716880	2722900	Nintendo estimates that they've made $33 million on the Virtual Console alone, and that kind
2722900	2727960	of includes 7.8 million downloads across the service.
2727960	2728960	Wow.
2728960	2730440	Lots of money.
2730440	2732360	And it's free money, essentially.
2732360	2735440	I can't imagine the Virtual Console takes that much work.
2735440	2736440	All that bandwidth.
2736440	2742000	Well, it's not just that, but obviously they kind of have rewritten all the manuals in
2742000	2745320	the Wii, because the Wii thing has their own manuals and stuff, and I'm sure they still
2745320	2747760	have to do QA on all the games and what have you.
2747760	2751360	So it's not like they do it completely free, but it's certainly much cheaper than making
2751360	2753360	a new game.
2753360	2760640	So this is probably very high cost efficiency type thing, cost gains, whatever they call
2760640	2761640	that in the business world.
2761640	2764360	Remember, they sell each one of those consoles at a profit.
2764360	2771160	All right, well, speaking of the Virtual Console, some more titles coming out have been spoiled
2771160	2775560	by the one and only ESRB, so you can expect in the near future, Top Hunter for the Neo
2775560	2781040	Geo, Puyo Puyo 2 for the Genesis, King of Fighters 94 on the Neo Geo, Baseball Stars
2781040	2785720	2, Bases Loaded on the NES, that game was pretty awesome, actually, the Dynastic Hero
2785720	2790160	on the Turbografx-16, and Power Golf on the Neo Geo as well.
2790160	2791160	Wow.
2791160	2794120	All must be making their way sometime in the near future.
2794120	2797380	Also just wanted to say really quickly that it's also been spoiled that on the Japanese
2797380	2802560	Virtual Console, they'll be getting Treasure Hunter G, which is a game I vaguely remember.
2802560	2806400	Why aren't they releasing better titles?
2806400	2807400	I don't understand.
2807400	2811360	Well, Treasure Hunter G was actually a pretty awesome RPG 16-bit.
2811360	2814040	It kind of reminiscent of Final Fantasy VI a little bit.
2814040	2817400	That's pretty cool, but I mean, the other games, like fucking Power Golf, who the hell
2817400	2818400	played that?
2818400	2822200	Bases Loaded, whatever, that's an okay game, I guess.
2822200	2826680	Bases Loaded was kind of cool, but Baseball Stars was better on the NES.
2826680	2827680	I like that game.
2827680	2831880	I didn't play any baseball games on the NES, because I don't care about sports games.
2831880	2832880	You know what's weird?
2832880	2836940	Usually I'm not into sports games either, but I liked, here's the thing, I liked sports
2836940	2839680	games a lot when they were simple.
2839680	2841560	That's why I loved NBA Jam so much.
2841560	2846160	I mean, that game was relatively, I mean that game was kind of made for, you know, dummies
2846160	2849920	who can't really play basketball, but enjoy to watch it, you know?
2849920	2851440	That's why I liked NBA Jam.
2851440	2860200	Anyhow, anyways, in Japan, the Everybody's Nintendo Wii Channel has been launched, and
2860200	2864000	of course, for those who may not know, it's a brand new channel that offers all sorts
2864000	2870480	of things, including release dates, promotional videos, and DS demos that you can stream to
2870480	2872200	your DS.
2872200	2876880	So that's actually pretty cool, and it will allow you to view commercials, gameplay footage,
2876880	2883480	they'll have interviews about various Nintendo products, box art, release schedules for the
2883480	2886600	DS and the Wii, and other fun stuff.
2886600	2891040	And hopefully soon, demos for Wii games as well.
2891040	2896920	But right now they've got some different touch generation title demos, and of course the
2896920	2900640	Japanese versions of Pokemon Diamond and Pearl.
2900640	2904160	Now this seems like a very natural thing that Nintendo probably should have had a while
2904160	2905160	ago.
2905160	2906960	Do you have a word on when we might get this in the US at all?
2906960	2910120	Fuck if I know, but this is something they were promising, what, before the Wii ever
2910120	2911120	came out?
2911120	2912120	Mm-hmm.
2912120	2915640	Well, I don't know if they were ever necessarily promising it, but I think a lot of people
2915640	2921460	kind of inferred that, hey, the DS has Wi-Fi in it, hey, so does your Wii, hmm, could the
2921460	2923300	Wii interface with the DS later?
2923300	2926040	And then, you know, you saw games like the Pokemon Stadium or whatever that game was.
2926040	2928400	What ever happened to my new content every fucking day?
2928400	2930080	Wii Connect 24, come on.
2930080	2933920	Well, you get new weather reports every day, don't you?
2933920	2934920	Granted you might be looking-
2934920	2936760	No, because I have Wii Connect 24 turned off.
2936760	2940640	You're looking at your Wii at 5 o'clock at night, and you see the weather from midnight
2940640	2941640	that morning, but-
2941640	2944840	Wii Connect 24 doesn't like my mod chip.
2944840	2945840	Wow-s.
2945840	2950040	All right, let's see.
2950040	2955400	Mac Man says, everybody's Nintendo channel in America, now Nintendo, kill the chibi motherfucking
2955400	2959280	robo team and get to work on it.
2959280	2961040	That's an order from Mac Man in chat.
2961040	2963320	Yeah, stop making chibi robo games, they suck.
2963320	2965200	That's right, just knock it off.
2965200	2968400	We're not saying fire those guys, just put them to work elsewhere.
2968400	2970920	I'm saying fire those guys.
2970920	2975960	Anyhow, you might have heard earlier in the show I mentioned that I was a fan of the game
2975960	2979000	Eternal Sonata that came out a little earlier this year.
2979000	2984760	Trycrescendo was the folks that made, Crescendo made this game, and they're now working on
2984760	2990040	a new game called Fragile, and it's a new RPG that's going to be coming out for the
2990040	2993520	Nintendo Wii, which is a system that Eternal Sonata was not on.
2993520	2998000	It's on 360 and going to be coming out on PS3, but Fragile is going to be coming out
2998000	2999740	on the Nintendo Wii.
2999740	3005360	All we know so far is that the main character is a guy named Set, and you explore various
3005360	3006360	cities.
3006360	3009800	It takes place in a post-apocalyptic world.
3009800	3018640	Most of the details at this time are in Japanese, but there is an official website up at fragile.namco-ch.net.
3018640	3022800	There's also a little teaser trailer out there on the internet for the game, and I'm sure
3022800	3026400	a lot of people are kind of excited about this because, you know, obviously the first
3026400	3031760	generation of Wii games felt like ported PlayStation 2 games with motion control, so these type
3031760	3034760	of game announcements get people excited for what the Wii can really do.
3034760	3039680	Cool, and that reminds me, there's another game that's going to be coming out here,
3039680	3046240	Opuna, that came out in Japan, I believe, and it's coming out over here in like February,
3046240	3049760	I want to say, I'm going to check out the Japanese version next week, hopefully, too.
3049760	3052880	Although I don't really know how much I'm going to be able to play out of those games,
3052880	3056360	especially role-playing games, because they're all in Japanese, and I speak no Japanese,
3056360	3058920	or at least very little Japanese.
3058920	3065160	Anyways, the Nintendo DS in the UK has set some new sales records.
3065160	3073880	They have sold 191,000 units in the UK, and that's more than any other hardware format
3073880	3081480	has achieved in a seven-day period, so that's a pretty good week for them, I guess.
3081480	3087280	The previous record was held by the PSP during its launch in September of 05, where it sold
3087280	3089280	185,000 units.
3089280	3096080	Alrighty, how about we start looking at some release dates, travel the world, and look
3096080	3101120	at games that you can pick up in the UK right now if you think another game should be selling
3101120	3102120	a lot of units.
3102120	3106200	But first, before we get into release dates, one thing we promised a few weeks ago on the
3106200	3112600	show is that we would be tracking sales numbers, because we have ways of getting the MPD sales
3112600	3118320	numbers, and obviously, one game you guys want to know the sales on is Eye of Judgment,
3118320	3119960	and that's because of the bet.
3119960	3124220	If you recall, a bet was made on this program that Eye of Judgment, as Loki said, would
3124220	3128080	no way in hell sell a million copies within six months of release.
3128080	3134040	In fact, if the game manages to sell one million copies in six months within its release, Loki
3134040	3139560	has said he will dress up in a tingle outfit and dance around in the garage, setting an
3139560	3147480	Eye of Judgment on fire while playing a game versus Bobby Blackwolf, all on video for YouTube
3147480	3149160	for years to come.
3149160	3153160	However, we have to get the game to sell a million units first, and we have an update
3153160	3154160	on the numbers.
3154160	3156360	Loki, how many units are we there?
3156360	3157360	Are we there yet?
3157360	3162880	At least in the US, we're up to 17,600 units.
3162880	3167760	But I will have you know, though, that's just from launch to December 3rd.
3167760	3169120	I haven't gotten the new numbers yet.
3169120	3171920	Hopefully, in the next couple of weeks, I'll have new numbers for us.
3171920	3174800	So that's about within the first three weeks of release?
3174800	3175800	Like two or three, yeah.
3175800	3176800	All right.
3176800	3179880	So we're 1.7% of the way there.
3179880	3181320	Yay!
3181320	3182320	Making good progress.
3182320	3183660	Keep at it, guys.
3183660	3186800	Good luck to you.
3186800	3189520	I'm looking at the chat room to see what's going on.
3189520	3192440	Dark Tetsuya says, that's it?
3192440	3195600	Sorry, folks.
3195600	3200720	I wish I had better news for you, but that's it so far.
3200720	3202280	All right.
3202280	3204240	Anyhow, let's look at the release dates.
3204240	3208400	We'll start off in Europe since the last story was about Europe, and coming out on the seventh
3208400	3214400	in Europe, Alvin and the Chipmunks, the movie game tie-in on the DS, PC, and Wii.
3214400	3219780	Game movie tie-ins, Beowulf comes out on the PSP, also Brother in Arms, Road to Hill 30
3219780	3225720	comes out on the Wii, Disgaea makes its way to the PSP, Dragon Blade Wrath of Fire comes
3225720	3231920	out on the Wii, Juiced 2 on the PC, hey, hey, Link's Crossbow Training comes out on the
3231920	3236280	Nintendo Wii, Myst comes out on the DS.
3236280	3239560	I forgot that they were remaking the old Myst games on DS.
3239560	3241560	That's what this is, right?
3241560	3242560	That's pretty rad.
3242560	3243880	Is that out here in the US?
3243880	3246760	I don't think on the DS, but I know it's on the PSP.
3246760	3250840	Pokemon Battle Revolution finally comes out on the Wii, over in Europe this week, Pro
3250840	3257200	Evo Soccer 2008 on the DS, also this week on the seventh, Sing Star PlayStation 3 finally
3257200	3262920	this week on the seventh, SOCOM on the PSP, Soldier of Fortune Payback on the 360 on the
3262920	3268960	PC, Sonic Rivals 2 on the PSP, couple ports of the Golden Compass on PBS and PC, Tomb
3268960	3273080	Raider Anniversary makes its way to the Wii, and Ultimate Mortal Kombat on the DS, and
3273080	3277360	PlayStation 3 isn't left out, Uncharted, Drake's Fortune comes out.
3277360	3281080	And if you're looking for something a little more casual, something mom can get into, Who
3281080	3284240	Wants to Be a Millionaire comes out on the Wii this week.
3284240	3287000	No word yet if Meredith Vieira stars or not.
3287000	3288000	Okay.
3288000	3290720	In the US, we have Alvin and the Chipmunks.
3290720	3293280	Actually she wouldn't, because those are the Europe release dates, and they have a different
3293280	3297200	host over there, so I look stupid.
3297200	3302740	In the US, Alvin and the Chipmunks coming out on PC, DS, PlayStation 2, and I believe
3302740	3305520	the Wii.
3305520	3311720	American Girl, Julie Finds Away, with I must say the most creepy cover for a game I have
3311720	3314320	ever seen, this crazy chick.
3314320	3315320	What the hell?
3315320	3316320	I don't know.
3316320	3319080	She's just kind of creepy looking.
3319080	3321540	Wait, what the hell game is this?
3321540	3326200	American Girl, Julie Finds Away, finds a way to pull the Doom Switch is the way it looks
3326200	3328400	like here.
3328400	3334520	It looks like Julie, like, you know how blind people use that white cane?
3334520	3335760	That's kind of what it looks like to me.
3335760	3339600	She looks like she's like rowing a gondola or something.
3339600	3342720	Can you post that in chat so you can see that?
3342720	3345800	She finds a way to make some money rowing a gondola.
3345800	3348200	What is the game about?
3348200	3349200	I don't know.
3349200	3350200	I don't know.
3350200	3351760	Who gives a shit?
3351760	3356360	For those listening on the archive, seriously, look up this game in the box art, it's kind
3356360	3357360	of scary.
3357360	3361640	Anyways, the Golden Compass is coming out this week as well and that's on Playstation
3361640	3368840	2, Playstation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and PSP, probably did DS as well.
3368840	3376480	Let's see, Dragon Ball Z Budokai Tenkaichi 3 on the Wii, it's coming out as well.
3376480	3380760	Draglade on the DS, which is supposed to be a pretty good game, I think that's sort of
3380760	3383440	a music game too, actually.
3383440	3390480	A small little game here called Dance Dance Revolution Universe 2, the bundle only is
3390480	3394120	coming out this week.
3394120	3396080	Universe at War, Earth Assault.
3396080	3398520	When does the game itself come out?
3398520	3399520	Do we know?
3399520	3400520	January.
3400520	3402640	You want to hear something even weirder?
3402640	3407280	DDR Caught as a Party, the game only version, it's not coming out until April now.
3407280	3413000	What the fuck, I mean seriously, the game is out right now in a bundle, but for some
3413000	3415960	reason cannot release the game by itself until April.
3415960	3416960	Nope.
3416960	3418920	Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.
3418920	3420420	Anyways, Yu-Gi-Oh!
3420420	3431800	World Championship 2008 on the DS, let's see here, I know this week is pretty light, Left
3431800	3435280	Behind Eternal Forces expansion pack is coming out this week.
3435280	3439920	Godzilla Unleashed on the Wii, which I'm sure is wonderful.
3439920	3449000	Strawberry Shortcake, the Four Seasons cake on the DS.
3449000	3455120	Jenga on the Wii, absolutely the best idea for a game ever.
3455120	3456440	Jenga?
3456440	3460540	It's $30, folks, that's actually more than the actual game cost.
3460540	3465920	What I want to know is are you still supposed to chant Jenga, Jenga, while someone's removing
3465920	3466920	the block?
3466920	3470080	Because you know you're supposed to do that in the regular game?
3470080	3471080	Is that what it says in the rules?
3471080	3472080	I don't know.
3472080	3477240	It's something my friend told me when I was a kid, so it probably was made up, just to
3477240	3478240	make me look stupid.
3478240	3483480	Everyone's like, what the hell are you talking about, Rob, we don't do that.
3483480	3487200	I believe that would be made up, Rob.
3487200	3490720	Anyways, that's it.
3490720	3495440	Then let's go over to Japan, where they get some games before we do, and one of the biggies
3495440	3499920	is Lost Odyssey, making its way to the Xbox 360 on December 6th.
3499920	3506280	Also on the Xbox 360 this week in Japan, Conan, as well as Virtua Fighter 5, which I know
3506280	3508600	is one that people are looking forward to.
3508600	3512880	A game that people are probably not looking forward to so much, Viva Pinata Party Animals,
3512880	3518760	or as they call it, Atsumare, Viva Pinata, Let's Party, coming out on the Xbox 360.
3518760	3521260	On the PlayStation 3, Conan as well.
3521260	3525720	Also Pirates of the Caribbean, At World's End comes out on December 6th.
3525720	3530720	Also Uncharted, Drake's Fortune, and a brand new USB headset, if you're into that.
3530720	3535760	Also coming out on the Nintendo Wii, we have No More Heroes coming out on the 6th, as well
3535760	3541120	as Rayman Raving Rabbids 2, or Rabbids Party Returns, is what the localized version is.
3541120	3544280	Okay, did they really need to make a sequel to that shitty-ass game?
3544280	3545960	Oh my god, that game was awful.
3545960	3547640	Actually, I hear the second one is pretty good.
3547640	3548640	It's pretty fun.
3548640	3549640	It's probably not bad.
3549640	3551680	Because they've taken over Earth.
3551680	3555160	Namco's putting out a game called, or I'm sorry, Bandai, well, it's the same thing.
3555160	3560760	Mina de Asubo de Namco Carnival comes out on the Wii, which I'm sure is just probably
3560760	3566300	a collection of past games, or it might be, I don't know, this might be some type of like
3566300	3569460	Mario Party game, but starring the Namco characters.
3569460	3576880	I think that's actually the, what was it, the Namco collection that came out over here.
3576880	3580240	Oh, okay, with the upgraded games and stuff?
3580240	3581240	Yeah.
3581240	3582240	That makes sense.
3582240	3589400	Also coming out on the Wii from Sega, Doraemon Wii, Himitsu Dougo Ketai Sen is coming out.
3589400	3594640	Also, wait for it, Disney Princess Enchanted Journey this week on the Wii.
3594640	3595640	Yay!
3595640	3596640	Yay!
3596640	3601000	Also another Tamagotchi game, Tamagotchi no Furi Furi Kaje Kaiden comes out as well.
3601000	3603720	I hope I want to play No More Heroes, that looks fun.
3603720	3607240	On the PlayStation 2, lots of stuff as well, another version of Pirates of the Caribbean
3607240	3608640	at World's End.
3608640	3613280	Another Mahjong game, hurray, Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories finally comes out on
3613280	3618480	the PlayStation 2, and another version of Disney Princess Enchanted Journey, as well
3618480	3620720	as a game called Finalist.
3620720	3624240	I think that's just a price reduction, though, it was already a game out there from Princess
3624240	3628200	Soft, one of our favorite Japanese companies.
3628200	3629200	Princess Soft?
3629200	3631560	They put out a lot of games.
3631560	3636040	Also on the Nintendo DS this week in Japan, Arkanoid DS, that's the one that comes with
3636040	3640000	a little paddle that goes in the Game Boy band slot, that's kind of neat.
3640000	3646600	Also coming out, we have Doko Demo Raku Raku DS Kaibou comes out, I don't know if that's
3646600	3652940	a price reduction or what that is, but this is the thing though, you always kind of worry
3652940	3657160	because they advertise on the box how cheap it is.
3657160	3658160	So that's always...
3658160	3660920	Very cheapo game!
3660920	3667520	So K1 World GP comes out on the DS, and you want me to try to pronounce this one?
3667520	3670760	This one's going to be kind of fun, here it is.
3670760	3681240	Maru Kaitei Dondon Obaru Kyui no Sugawa Shiki Kanji Kyoku Jutsu Kaiso Gaku Shu-hen.
3681240	3684000	It's a language learning program, which apparently I need.
3684000	3687040	Yeah, you really do.
3687040	3692920	I can special order this game from Japan, said it probably won't help me because it's
3692920	3698200	probably for Japanese people to learn other languages, so I'll be screwed.
3698200	3704900	Also on the DS, Tales of Innocence comes out, that's a Namco game, and wow, pretty big week
3704900	3706740	in Japan I must say.
3706740	3710320	But I guess they don't have the big shopping day like we do here, so they get games right
3710320	3712280	up until Christmas.
3712280	3717080	Coming out on PSP, another version of Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories, also Silent
3717080	3721320	Hill Zero comes out, which was Silent Hill Origins here.
3721320	3728320	Minano Golf Portable 2, that's just hotshots golf, comes out over there as well, and that's
3728320	3729320	it.
3729320	3730320	Awesome.
3730320	3740480	Anyways, so this is actually pretty recent news, Activision and VinVidi have merged into
3740480	3745880	one super company, Activision you'll know of course behind the such wonderful series
3745880	3752560	as Call of Duty, Tony Hawk, and the lesser known Cabela's, and VinVidi of course behind
3752560	3759440	such wonderful games as Spyro, Scarface, oh and a small little game called World of Warcraft,
3759440	3762720	or they own Blizzard, which is behind World of Warcraft.
3762720	3770080	Of course, this whole merger, you know, it's gonna be pretty good I'd say for both companies,
3770080	3773240	but you know, millions of dollars here, actually billions of dollars.
3773240	3774240	Bad for the gamers.
3774240	3775240	No, I'm just kidding.
3775240	3776240	I have no idea.
3776240	3777240	18 billion dollar deal.
3777240	3778240	Woo!
3778240	3779240	That's a lot of money.
3779240	3780240	That's a lot of money.
3780240	3783000	So, I don't know.
3783000	3785640	But the new company is called Activision Blizzard, yes?
3785640	3786640	Yes.
3786640	3787640	That's a little lame.
3787640	3788640	I don't like the name.
3788640	3793720	So is it gonna be like, Activision Blizzcon, is it gonna be like...
3793720	3798240	I think you will see little things like that probably happen.
3798240	3801800	Why can't they just call it Act of Avendi or whatever?
3801800	3805560	Or just decide which company gets to keep its name.
3805560	3807920	Or VivendiVision or something.
3807920	3812440	I just hope this means we get the level 70 Tauren Chieftain Warrior Songs and Guitar
3812440	3813440	Hero.
3813440	3815440	You already made that joke earlier, Rob.
3815440	3816440	When we weren't on air.
3816440	3819320	Why don't they just call the company World of Warcraft?
3819320	3820320	There you go.
3820320	3821320	They should, yeah.
3821320	3822320	There you go.
3822320	3826400	World of Warcraft, World of Warcraft for World of Warcraft players.
3826400	3829560	That's a great idea.
3829560	3832080	That means now Activision is gonna have my bank account number.
3832080	3835960	I don't know how I feel about that.
3835960	3842200	All of a sudden you'll get, you know, soldiers coming in from Call of Duty 4.
3842200	3846440	You know, Blizzard swears up and down this is not gonna have any effect on...
3846440	3847440	I doubt it.
3847440	3848440	I don't think it will either.
3848440	3849440	Why would it?
3849440	3850440	I mean...
3850440	3851440	I don't know.
3851440	3852440	But wouldn't that be interesting though?
3852440	3857480	Does this happen when like, you know, Activision got Red Octane who had done Guitar Hero, right?
3857480	3859800	Then Guitar Hero 3 went to Neversoft.
3859800	3862080	Does this mean now that Activision...
3862080	3864880	I mean, this is something I could seriously see happening.
3864880	3868360	Does this mean now that Activision is another resource for companies such as Blizzard, does
3868360	3871800	this mean that Activision could send off something that everybody's been waiting for?
3871800	3875800	Like Starcraft Ghost somewhere else to be developed and finished?
3875800	3876800	It's possible.
3876800	3879280	That's the ramification I think could happen out of this.
3879280	3887720	Or we could have such wonderful games as Project Gotham Racing World of Warcraft Edition where
3887720	3891160	you're racing cars through World of Warcraft.
3891160	3894800	Yes, because there's so many cars in World of War...
3894800	3895800	Hey!
3895800	3896800	Hey!
3896800	3897800	Listen.
3897800	3898800	Fictional tracks, okay?
3898800	3899800	Come on.
3899800	3902200	Obviously there's not real cars there, but they could have flying mounts.
3902200	3903200	It would have to be...
3903200	3904200	You could race your mounts.
3904200	3905200	Project...
3905200	3907360	Project Gotham Kodo Racing would work.
3907360	3908360	Oh my god.
3908360	3912480	That's terrible.
3912480	3917720	That would be my guess on what's going to happen is that some of the Blizzard franchises
3917720	3919720	that Blizzard has not had time to pay attention to...
3919720	3920920	Guitar Hero is the new...
3920920	3924480	Activision will make Diablo III.
3924480	3925480	Somebody's going to do it.
3925480	3928080	Guitar Hero is the new class in the next Warcraft.
3928080	3930240	Oh, that would be awesome!
3930240	3931240	Expansion.
3931240	3933240	Being able to play instruments.
3933240	3934240	Yeah.
3934240	3938080	We could come up with tons of dumb ideas.
3938080	3942640	Frisbee says, there's no tracks in World of Warcraft, in reference to that commercial
3942640	3944800	from a little while ago.
3944800	3949560	I want a game, though, that would be cool to have a role-playing game online that has
3949560	3953620	a bunch of weird shit in it that makes no sense whatsoever, because I've never played
3953620	3954620	a game like that.
3954620	3955620	Exactly!
3955620	3962400	But I'm talking absolutely crazy shit, where you can summon a giant jeep to come through
3962400	3965720	and crush people, just for no apparent reason.
3965720	3966720	Just crazy shit.
3966720	3967720	Oh my god.
3967720	3971240	And so are you proposing that you need to meet with the heads of Activision Blizzard
3971240	3973920	to propose Loki's World of Randomness?
3973920	3978760	Hey, I like the ring of that.
3978760	3979880	I think I might buy that.
3979880	3984280	Chat room, would you buy a game called Loki's World of Randomness?
3984280	3987980	I'm going to attack you with my cat.
3987980	3988980	Laser cats.
3988980	3989980	Laser cats.
3989980	3992640	We'll license laser cats.
3992640	3994800	There you have it.
3994800	3997080	Ten million right there.
3997080	3998080	Jellybean attacks.
3998080	4002080	Oh no, zap it with a laser cat.
4002080	4006160	I summon the truck to run it over, never mind.
4006160	4008520	Less QQ, more Mew Mew.
4008520	4010800	That was awful.
4010800	4012840	We should move on.
4012840	4016440	The doctor says I would pay $300.
4016440	4022560	Dark Tetsuya says do want.
4022560	4026120	Dark Tetsuya gave you a LOL Irene for your less QQ, more Mew Mew.
4026120	4027120	Yay.
4027120	4028120	I like that.
4028120	4029120	That was good.
4029120	4030120	Good times.
4030120	4031120	Alrighty.
4031120	4032120	Sony.
4032120	4034120	What the hell is that?
4034120	4037760	Talking dolphins?
4037760	4041720	It's unfortunately a reference to a book that sucks.
4041720	4048280	Anyhow, Sony has decided to drop their ad agency of the past 13 years.
4048280	4050960	Why did they decide to drop it now?
4050960	4057240	Well, I'm guessing probably after what happened in hindsight of the whole PlayStation 3 debacle
4057240	4059880	where the ads were not so hot.
4059880	4062160	Well, that was like last year.
4062160	4063160	I mean, come on.
4063160	4065520	There's like, you know, we really should drop them.
4065520	4066520	I mean, come on.
4066520	4067840	It hasn't really done that well for us.
4067840	4069080	Let's give it some more time.
4069080	4070080	Come on.
4070080	4071800	Well, maybe the people will turn around a year later.
4071800	4076160	Maybe we should really drop them now because these ads have kind of sucked.
4076160	4077160	Okay.
4077160	4085080	So in reference, the ad agency was TBWA Chiade was the full name of the ad agency.
4085080	4090200	And if you're wondering, does this affect both the U.S. and Europe, yes, it does.
4090200	4093560	They were also the ones that created the whole black and white campaign.
4093560	4097960	Remember that thing for the PSP that some people called racist and the other like circus
4097960	4100620	to Soleil one they have going on.
4100620	4102480	This has been kind of a long time coming.
4102480	4103700	Oh my God.
4103700	4105200	Some might say.
4105200	4109920	Anyways, just in case you're worried that Grand Theft Auto might not be coming out pretty
4109920	4110920	soon.
4110920	4112500	Well, we still don't know when it's coming out.
4112500	4118320	But they are starting to run some more videos and stuff for it, including a box art reveal
4118320	4125480	trailer, which they elaborately painted a, you know, giant copy of the box art for Grand
4125480	4128760	Theft Auto IV on a giant canvas painting.
4128760	4131320	And it looks pretty awesome, but you know, your typical Grand Theft Auto.
4131320	4133040	It's like every other Grand Theft Auto game I've ever seen.
4133040	4134040	Yeah, your typical Grand Theft Auto one.
4134040	4138000	Of course, people are dissecting to say, Oh my God, there's motorcycles and helicopters
4138000	4139000	in the game.
4139000	4140000	Oh, really?
4140000	4141000	Like every other game.
4141000	4145600	Anyways, so I hope the giant air tram can be used as like a weapon or something.
4145600	4149880	Yeah, I hope you can cut the cables to that thing.
4149880	4153800	Oh, I wish anyways.
4153800	4158480	But there's going to be a brand new trailer on December 6th, which is entitled Move Up
4158480	4161480	Ladies.
4161480	4172800	Next Thursday at 3 p.m. Eastern Time is when you can expect that trailer, when the internet
4172800	4173800	explodes with it all over the place.
4173800	4177440	Yeah, but you can expect to see it 24 hours later after the traffic dies down because
4177440	4180480	you know their servers are going to get killed when the trailer comes out.
4180480	4186480	Because like, didn't they say when the first one came out that it broke the internet?
4186480	4188120	Yeah, something like that.
4188120	4191560	But hey, that's good that they're showing trailers because that means that there's more
4191560	4193280	work being done on it.
4193280	4196640	At least that's what I'd like to assume.
4196640	4199920	Some new details have come out for another game that's getting an anticipated sequel
4199920	4200920	next year.
4200920	4205780	Silent Hill 5 comes out next year and some new details have come out about the game.
4205780	4210560	The flashlight and radio static is going to be returning to the game.
4210560	4213420	Those kind of features didn't really exist in Silent Hill 4.
4213420	4216800	But then again, that's not very surprising because Silent Hill 4 was not even originally
4216800	4220320	going to be a Silent Hill game, so what have you.
4220320	4225160	Light apparently is going to actually kind of have a pretty major function in this game.
4225160	4229120	The enemies will respond based on whatever the light is doing.
4229120	4233600	There's also going to be some puzzles that involve an x-ray viewer and nurses that you
4233600	4236880	know are doing scary things.
4236880	4241200	It sounds like the game of course is being greatly inspired by the Silent Hill movie
4241200	4243240	but I don't think that's such a bad thing to be honest.
4243240	4244920	I loved the movie.
4244920	4245920	Here's the other biggest change.
4245920	4249480	Silent Hill 5 will not have preset camera angles.
4249480	4250480	Really?
4250480	4253560	You will control the entire visuals.
4253560	4256840	That's actually, I'm not sure how I feel about that.
4256840	4260240	That could be a double edged sword there.
4260240	4263760	And then the other thing that's kind of weird about it too is the damage system that they
4263760	4268600	have in it now is going to be like Metal Gear Solid 3 where there's just not health power
4268600	4271520	ups anymore to heal you.
4271520	4274840	You have to like, I don't know.
4274840	4276160	Kill a snake and eat it.
4276160	4279080	Break a grenade open and like, you know.
4279080	4282520	Silent Hill 5, break a grenade open and.
4282520	4285480	Like Rambo style or something, I don't know.
4285480	4286520	That's going to be interesting.
4286520	4291700	Also there's supposed to be a mini game that has puzzles from like God of War which were
4291700	4294560	like DDR-ish in a way, button tapping things.
4294560	4300680	Oh god, like every other fucking game on earth now with the stupid context sensitive shit.
4300680	4303600	Yes, but Konami made DDR so it's okay.
4303600	4308720	Wait, it's not like DDR, it's just Shenmue did it first.
4308720	4309720	Whatever.
4309720	4316040	Anyways, Metal Gear Solid 4, according to the producer, must sell a million copies day
4316040	4320920	one in order for them to make their money.
4320920	4327440	So with that being released exclusively on the Playstation 3 right now, that's going
4327440	4329640	to be pretty hard for them to do.
4329640	4333080	I mean the Eye of Judgment could only sell 17,000 in the first three weeks.
4333080	4340280	Let me put it this way, no Playstation 3 to date has sold a million copies day one.
4340280	4344960	I don't know if any of them have sold a million copies at all.
4344960	4349600	So I mean, granted, if there was going to be a game that's going to do that, I'd say
4349600	4351960	Metal Gear Solid 4 would probably be it.
4351960	4354760	Are we sure this guy wasn't just exaggerating a little bit?
4354760	4361360	No, just because of the price it cost to develop this stuff.
4361360	4367400	It's got to sell that many units in order to make up its production costs.
4367400	4371200	But anyway, that might be worldwide.
4371200	4375280	I don't know, if it's worldwide I could see that it could probably do that.
4375280	4377820	It will sell a million units probably.
4377820	4382360	But then again, also people wanting to draw that conclusion, well if they can't sell a
4382360	4387280	million units on the Playstation 3, maybe if they developed it for the Xbox 360 as well
4387280	4392940	they could sell a million units and whatever.
4392940	4395400	Maybe it will come out on the Xbox 360 someday.
4395400	4400520	Alright, well PC gamers are going to be very happy to hear, especially those that are into
4400520	4405280	first person shooters blended with RPGs, that Deus Ex is getting another sequel.
4405280	4408760	Deus Ex 3 is coming out from Eidos.
4408760	4412080	This was announced when they were talking about their newest studio in Montreal, which
4412080	4414640	opened up a little earlier this year.
4414640	4421480	The studio hopes to expand about 350 people in the year 2009, and they just recently have
4421480	4422680	started development on the game.
4422680	4426960	It just passed proof of concept stage, Deus Ex 3.
4426960	4429000	We will see what develops on this game.
4429000	4431680	I'm sure lots of people are foaming at the mouth because I know this is a very popular
4431680	4435760	game on the PC.
4435760	4439480	Here's a strange rumor that's coming from a very unusual source.
4439480	4445520	The unofficial Artie Lang site, you might know him from the Howard Stern show.
4445520	4451600	Apparently Lang will be voicing the role of a character named Big Al in an upcoming Leisure
4451600	4457160	Suit Larry game, which I think is pretty cool that they are making another Leisure Suit
4457160	4460480	Larry game.
4460480	4465260	That's a very interesting way that they found out that a new game is coming.
4465260	4471440	No word on when it's coming or what it's going to be, but interesting.
4471440	4477920	Yeah, I don't think a new Leisure Suit Larry game is going to really be that impressive,
4477920	4478920	to be honest.
4478920	4479920	Nah, the last one wasn't.
4479920	4480920	Alright.
4480920	4489600	Well, IGN has recently published their list of the OMG Top 100 Games of All Time list,
4489600	4490600	which it seems like...
4490600	4492060	Don't we get a list like this every couple of years?
4492060	4493060	Every year.
4493060	4497440	Here's the reason why I actually wanted to bring it up, is that I got to say, I think
4497440	4500000	the list isn't that bad, all things considered.
4500000	4504360	I know I've given corporate websites a hard time in the past, but all things considered,
4504360	4509440	I actually think this list is not too far different from what my list might look like
4509440	4511160	of the top games of all time.
4511160	4512160	I'll just run down.
4512160	4515640	Obviously, I don't have time to read all 100, but let's recap maybe the top 20 real quick.
4515640	4519080	I'll breeze through the bottom 10, and I'll go over the top 10.
4519080	4521680	Metal Gear Solid was number 20.
4521680	4523880	Doom was number 19.
4523880	4525440	Chrono Trigger was number 18.
4525440	4526440	Boo!
4526440	4527440	It should be number 1.
4527440	4533360	17 was Super Mario World, 16 was Shadow of the Colossus, 15 was Castlevania Symphony
4533360	4541740	of the Night, 14 was Pirates by Sid Meier, 13 was Ms. Pac-Man, 12 was Star Wars TIE Fighter.
4541740	4543840	I like that this list included PC games, too.
4543840	4544840	11 was StarCraft.
4544840	4546500	Alright, then here's the top 10.
4546500	4553360	Resident Evil 4 was number 10 on the GameCube, and obviously that game got a lot of game
4553360	4556840	of the year accolades when it came out, and it is a pretty great game.
4556840	4564040	Final Fantasy III or VI by the Japanese scale was the number 9 game of all time, which I
4564040	4567720	believe is the highest ranking Final Fantasy game on the list, so Final Fantasy VII was
4567720	4572460	not in the top 10, which I'm sure makes fanboys mad, but I think that's okay.
4572460	4577040	Number 8 was The Legend of Zelda, A Link to the Past.
4577040	4582420	Number 7 was Super Metroid, which would probably be my number 1, honestly.
4582420	4585320	Number 6 was Half-Life 2.
4585320	4590280	Number 5 was Super Mario 64, which a lot of people would probably put as their number
4590280	4593300	1, so it's kind of interesting that there's still some more games to go here.
4593300	4595640	Number 4 is The Legend of Zelda, Ocarina of Time.
4595640	4598800	So that's two Zeldas in the top 10?
4598800	4601680	Well, you know, the Zelda games are great games.
4601680	4602680	We're just confirming.
4602680	4605840	Yeah, no, it's two Zelda games in the top 10 so far.
4605840	4608920	Number 3 is Civilization II.
4608920	4612880	God bless them for remembering the Civilization series, because it is a great series.
4612880	4615480	It does deserve to be that high on the list.
4615480	4618380	Although I would have put the original Civilization, but that's just me.
4618380	4619640	Number 2 is Tetris.
4619640	4620640	Tetris.
4620640	4621760	Hmm, what's number 1?
4621760	4622760	What do you think number 1?
4622760	4625000	The number 1 greatest game of all time?
4625000	4627360	Pac-Man?
4627360	4632600	Super Mario Bros. on the NES, the very first original Super Mario Bros. game.
4632600	4637280	That does make a lot of sense, because who doesn't remember Super Mario Bros.?
4637280	4641240	If you played the theme for somebody, who doesn't know that theme and what that is?
4641240	4643560	Yeah, Mario is part of pop culture.
4643560	4647800	People know who Mario is, so it makes a lot of sense.
4647800	4649280	And it was a pretty good game at the time.
4649280	4650280	Well, yeah.
4650280	4651280	So there you go.
4651280	4652280	Still is.
4652280	4654200	Alright, well, there's a different website.
4654200	4658720	I also happen to be affiliated with IGN, doing another Top 10 list.
4658720	4665400	This of course is AskMen's Top 10 Hottest Women in Tech.
4665400	4668380	We'll run down this list here real quick, too.
4668380	4674040	Number 10, Wendy Chang, who apparently is a...
4674040	4675040	Let's see here.
4675040	4676040	Don't know her.
4676040	4677040	Don't know her.
4677040	4684040	She apparently does vidcasts on a network, clicknetwork.tv.
4684040	4685200	But she has big boobies.
4685200	4686200	So that's fine.
4686200	4687200	And she's Asian.
4687200	4688880	So, two points there.
4688880	4690840	Rise Princess has big boobies, and she's Asian.
4690840	4691840	Oh, stop it.
4691840	4692840	Anyways.
4692840	4695280	I don't do my own video games, though.
4695280	4708160	Let's see, Blair Butler, who is a stand-up comedian, and she's on X-Play, or she's a
4708160	4710160	writer on X-Play.
4710160	4719320	And she also has a reoccurring bit and tell geek out that appears on G4's website.
4719320	4722280	All these people G4 people, no.
4722280	4726120	Kristen Holt, she was a Dallas Cowboy...
4726120	4727440	No, she was on American Idol.
4727440	4729120	Yes, she was on American Idol.
4729120	4730120	I've heard of her.
4730120	4736400	She was also a Dallas Cowboy's cheerleader, and now she's the host of G4's Cheat.
4736400	4737560	Wow.
4737560	4744440	And she also hosts a new game called Shout About Television.
4744440	4747320	And she's working also as a tech reporter on Attack of the Shout.
4747320	4753000	Some might call this podcast Shout About Video Games, especially when Loki reviews things.
4753000	4754800	Hey, enough back talk.
4754800	4757400	That was a good one, Rahab.
4757400	4763640	Anyways, Amanda Cogdon, I don't know her either.
4763640	4768360	She apparently has a gig on Rocketboom, a daily video blog.
4768360	4769760	Wow.
4769760	4771080	Whatever.
4771080	4778920	Anyways, Veronica Belmont, not related, no relation to Simon Belmont.
4778920	4781880	Boring, then I don't give a shit about her.
4781880	4783260	Never heard of her.
4783260	4790960	She has, I guess, she's acted as a producer and sound engineer for CNET's Buzz Out Loud
4790960	4793680	podcast.
4793680	4795200	Let's move it a little faster, Loki.
4795200	4796200	Sorry.
4796200	4797200	Any guesses?
4797200	4798200	Number one, Morgan Webb?
4798200	4799200	No, this is not number one.
4799200	4800880	Actually, here, I'll just skip to number one.
4800880	4803160	We'll do the top three here real quick.
4803160	4804160	Thank you.
4804160	4809600	Anyways, number three, Jessica Chobot.
4809600	4810600	She's the one that licked the PSP, right?
4810600	4812640	She's the one that licked the PSP, and she's also...
4812640	4813640	Okay, have her to her.
4813640	4814640	Who is she?
4814640	4815640	She's also...
4815640	4816640	She was Friday Inn.
4816640	4823120	She was a model, and she does a lot of stuff on IGN, including their on the street stuff,
4823120	4826880	and she does the IGN Weekly and all that kind of crap.
4826880	4827880	Number two is Morgan Webb.
4827880	4832380	And only IGN could hire a woman to walk the streets and get paid for it.
4832380	4833600	That's what women do naturally.
4833600	4836000	They're so good at it.
4836000	4839920	Morgan Webb, of course, she's on X-Play, and we all know who she is.
4839920	4841100	She's the number one, then.
4841100	4845840	Number one is Amber McArthur, and apparently she's on...
4845840	4846840	I've never heard of her.
4846840	4850560	She's on G4's Tech2Be Canada's Call for Help show.
4850560	4853000	Okay, I have to see what she looks like.
4853000	4854000	She's...
4854000	4855000	No.
4855000	4856000	I want to see if she's pretty.
4856000	4857000	That's stand out.
4857000	4858000	I mean, she's cute, but...
4858000	4859000	She's very plain.
4859000	4861240	You know who she looks like?
4861240	4863240	What the hell was her name from Melrose Place?
4863240	4864240	Was it Melrose?
4864240	4865240	Heather Locklear?
4865240	4866240	No.
4866240	4867240	Oh.
4867240	4868240	So maybe it was...
4868240	4869240	Was it Melrose Place?
4869240	4870240	Come on, Courtney?
4870240	4871240	I know who you're talking about.
4871240	4872240	Courtney, yeah.
4872240	4873240	She was...
4873240	4874240	I don't know.
4874240	4875240	I don't know about her.
4875240	4876240	I don't know who she looks like.
4876240	4877240	Yes, her.
4877240	4879640	I don't fucking remember, but she looks exactly like her.
4879640	4880640	She's...
4880640	4883680	The very plain looking one on Ally McBeal, too.
4883680	4891560	Yes, and also Ally McBeal, the character, but wow, whoop-dee-doo.
4891560	4896640	But hey, I mean, seriously, why are they doing a top ten list?
4896640	4897920	Stop doing top ten lists, people.
4897920	4899720	People that nobody knows or cares about.
4899720	4902120	The chat room is naming some other people.
4902120	4905880	Miranda Cosgrove says Sakura Max, don't know who that is.
4905880	4909040	Olivia Munn says DJ Dark Knight.
4909040	4910960	Don't know who that is.
4910960	4912040	She's on Attack of the Show, right?
4912040	4913040	Diane Miyazoda.
4913040	4914040	Oh.
4914040	4915040	Yeah.
4915040	4916040	That's what Son of Dad says.
4916040	4917040	Diane Miyazoda.
4917040	4922240	She doesn't do Cheetah anymore, though, or not Cheetah, Filter.
4922240	4923240	She does...
4923240	4925920	She actually does some, like, I want to see, like a...
4925920	4926920	Rama says that's her name.
4926920	4927920	Courtney Thorne-Smith.
4927920	4929280	Courtney Thorne-Smith.
4929280	4930280	That's what it is.
4930280	4935440	It's like a... was it a makeover show or something like that, like for kids or something?
4935440	4936440	It's like a...
4936440	4937440	It's not...
4937440	4938440	Makeover for kids.
4938440	4940140	It's not for kids.
4940140	4941140	It's like...
4941140	4943680	Damn, my kid is ugly, Diane.
4943680	4946520	Not like that, like a room makeover.
4946520	4948760	It's like, you know, trading spaces, but for kids.
4948760	4950480	Oh, I know what you're talking about.
4950480	4951480	I've seen that before.
4951480	4952480	So...
4952480	4954560	No, it's not a makeover.
4954560	4955560	You're too fat, Timmy.
4955560	4956560	You're gonna get liposuction.
4956560	4959040	Well, haven't you ever seen that store at the mall?
4959040	4960760	What's it called, the Libby Loo or whatever?
4960760	4961760	Like it...
4961760	4962760	That's what...
4962760	4964480	It's like a makeover for little seven-year-old girls store.
4964480	4967080	And then, like, it's like a place where girls are supposed to have, like, their birthday
4967080	4969120	parties and stuff, and they'll get...
4969120	4973060	They'll all get makeovers together, and then, like, I swear to God, one day we were walking
4973060	4974060	by there.
4974060	4978000	I think it was Shane and I were at the mall, walking by there, and the little seven-year-old
4978000	4983240	girls were putting on a little dance routine that they'd learn, and oh my God, they look
4983240	4984240	like little sluts.
4984240	4988400	I mean, this is a horrible thing to say about seven-year-olds, but who would let their seven-year-old
4988400	4989400	learn these type of dances?
4989400	4991440	I mean, they looked like they were training to become strippers.
4991440	4994720	It was horrible.
4994720	4995720	And I think...
4995720	4998560	I don't remember who it was that said it, but somebody that I was with said something
4998560	5001960	about like, wow, they look like a bunch of little sluts, and one of the kids' parents
5001960	5002960	was right there.
5002960	5003960	And they're like...
5003960	5009120	They turn around, and they're like, yes, that's what we wanted.
5009120	5010760	Mission accomplished.
5010760	5011760	Anyhow.
5011760	5018560	Let's go ahead and move on with some other news, such as Super Smash Brothers.
5018560	5020920	We were talking about the Wii earlier in the show.
5020920	5025400	Super Smash Brothers Brawl, just the news does not stop about Super Smash Brothers Brawl.
5025400	5030520	And what's pretty awesome is that some of the old stages from Melee are going to return
5030520	5032040	in Super Smash Brothers Brawl.
5032040	5036480	So like the Zelda II temple is coming back.
5036480	5040680	But what they did is they actually, I think they like combined two stages to make this
5040680	5041680	stage.
5041680	5042680	Is that better?
5042680	5045040	No, that looks like the stage.
5045040	5046640	To me, that was a full stage.
5046640	5055640	Let me actually look at the original post here on the dojo about what it is.
5055640	5057200	Oh no, I guess it is the same stage.
5057200	5058440	Yeah, it looks exactly the same.
5058440	5063640	And they also posted the music from the stage there on the website.
5063640	5068280	That's a little bit of a remix.
5068280	5069880	Very cool.
5069880	5073320	That's on the SmashBrothers.com website.
5073320	5074320	Check that out.
5074320	5076760	Alright, well gosh, part A is running long tonight.
5076760	5078160	We're almost at an hour and a half.
5078160	5082880	But we want to go ahead and close out part A here, the way we always do, by paying tribute
5082880	5086200	to the classic games of yesteryear.
5086200	5089600	And Dark Soccer is not here tonight to do the classic game of the week, but we've been
5089600	5090600	filling in.
5090600	5093440	Last week I picked a game, Equinox, if you forgot.
5093440	5098440	And this week, Loki's going to pick a game for us as his classic game of the week.
5098440	5105800	Yes, classic game, I was torn on what I should pick.
5105800	5108160	Almost picked Gals Pamming.
5108160	5112540	But no, we'll save that for another episode when she's gone as well.
5112540	5118800	This week I decided to pick a wonderful game that I loved on the Super Nintendo and was
5118800	5120760	also on the Genesis as well.
5120760	5124920	It's a game called Zombies Ate My Neighbors.
5124920	5126880	And it's absolutely awesome.
5126880	5127880	It's very cheesy.
5127880	5133440	It's kind of like a spoof on a bunch of horror films from the 1950s and 60s.
5133440	5138520	It was made by LucasArts, actually published by Konami.
5138520	5141160	And definitely a game you should check out.
5141160	5146920	I wish it would come out on virtual consoles so we can play it again.
5146920	5150800	But tons and tons and tons of different levels you can play.
5150800	5158320	They have like squirt guns, grenades, all sorts of things you can fight.
5158320	5161480	Things from giant babies to UFOs, zombies.
5161480	5162480	You name it.
5162480	5164400	It's an awesome game.
5164400	5166120	Really fun.
5166120	5167640	I've actually never played this game.
5167640	5168640	No, I really have.
5168640	5171000	This is one of those games I just kind of missed.
5171000	5173000	You need to go do this.
5173000	5175000	Well then that's why they need to put it out on virtual console.
5175000	5179760	Yeah, you basically run through the stages trying to rescue people and stuff and collect
5179760	5184920	weapons and then sometimes they'll have you fight different things.
5184920	5187640	And each one of the stages is titled after a movie.
5187640	5188640	It's kind of like spoofed.
5188640	5193680	So they'll have a bunch that are like Night of the Living Dead and stuff like that.
5193680	5194680	That's cool.
5194680	5195680	He's freezing the zombies in this one.
5195680	5200840	Yeah, it might sound like it's kind of a generic game but it's really stylized and it's like
5200840	5201840	really fun.
5201840	5202840	You really just have to play it.
5202840	5203840	It's really interesting.
5203840	5208080	I always hear folks talking about this game but I've never really seen it in action so
5208080	5210480	there's a little cheerleader.
5210480	5212560	So by running over them they're saving them or something?
5212560	5213560	Yeah.
5213560	5214840	Oh, I think I remember seeing something like this.
5214840	5217440	He bounces on a trampoline to get over the hedge, right?
5217440	5218440	Yep.
5218440	5219440	Or he can...
5219440	5220440	Can he...
5220440	5222440	Oh yeah, he's saving that guy.
5222440	5223440	Interesting.
5223440	5225440	Oh, somebody else is bouncing on a trampoline.
5225440	5227440	Oh, that's kind of neat.
5227440	5228440	Alright, pretty cool.
5228440	5231360	Zombies Ate My Neighbors, your classic video game of the week.
5231360	5234040	Thank you very much, Loki.
5234040	5235040	Good job.
5235040	5236040	You're welcome.
5236040	5240320	Well, Loki, you sound like you've got a makeover.
5240320	5244920	Alright, anyhow, let's use this opportunity to take a little break and when we come back,
5244920	5246640	plenty more gaming news.
5246640	5248920	We have Xbox news we haven't even touched.
5248920	5250840	Xbox has a new dashboard update coming out soon.
5250840	5254240	We've got all the details when we come back from this little break.
5254240	5255240	Stay tuned.
5255240	5256640	Now you touched it.
5256640	5261960	Well, we'll get our hands real dirty with it when we come back, especially you and naughty
5261960	5262960	Rice Princess.
5262960	5263960	Yeah, because it's a piece of crap.
5263960	5264960	Alright.
5264960	5268040	The update for the Xbox continues all segment long.
5268040	5270480	Alright, let's take a break.
