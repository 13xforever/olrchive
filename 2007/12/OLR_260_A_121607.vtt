00:00.000 --> 00:19.920
Tonight, December 16th, 2007, internet radio hits the PSP in one part of the world, Mass

00:19.920 --> 00:24.600
Effect and Assassin's Creed boast big sales, and how would you feel about a wee rain check

00:24.600 --> 00:31.600
under the tree this Christmas?

00:31.600 --> 00:35.120
Hello everybody out there on the internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge

00:35.120 --> 00:36.120
Radio.

00:36.120 --> 00:40.440
We are that program on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture,

00:40.440 --> 00:41.520
and the gamer lifestyle.

00:41.520 --> 00:46.000
My name is Rob Roberts, joining me as always, say hello to the one and only, Dark Sakura,

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
Jamie Summers.

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
Yo.

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
How you doing, Miss Summers?

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
Long day?

00:52.000 --> 00:53.320
Long weekend?

00:53.320 --> 00:54.320
I don't know.

00:54.320 --> 00:55.320
Yeah?

00:55.320 --> 00:56.320
I'm thinking about it still.

00:56.320 --> 00:57.320
I'm making a decision.

00:57.320 --> 00:58.320
A decision?

00:58.320 --> 01:01.120
But I can't do it without having, you know, without being fully informed.

01:01.120 --> 01:02.280
Okay, well that's good.

01:02.280 --> 01:04.640
You should always be fully informed when making a decision.

01:04.640 --> 01:05.640
Yeah.

01:05.640 --> 01:08.360
And I would like to say a nice decision on your shirt to wear to the show tonight.

01:08.360 --> 01:11.080
I know the Op 11ers can't see it because the way our cam is, but...

01:11.080 --> 01:12.800
I could go put my boobs in front of the camera.

01:12.800 --> 01:14.760
A lovely, I bet the boys would like that.

01:14.760 --> 01:15.760
A lovely...

01:15.760 --> 01:16.760
That's quite all right.

01:16.760 --> 01:18.840
A lovely pyramid head t-shirt she's wearing today with Silenil.

01:18.840 --> 01:22.640
I'm wearing my very, very favorite long-sleeved shirt.

01:22.640 --> 01:23.640
Very nice.

01:23.640 --> 01:24.640
Keeps you warm.

01:24.640 --> 01:26.160
Pyramid head keeps you warm during these winter months.

01:26.160 --> 01:27.160
Keeps you warm with evil.

01:27.160 --> 01:28.160
All right.

01:28.160 --> 01:29.160
Sounds good.

01:29.160 --> 01:30.880
Say hello as well to the one and only tech master, Loki.

01:30.880 --> 01:31.880
Hello.

01:31.880 --> 01:32.880
How are you doing, Loki?

01:32.880 --> 01:33.880
I'm okay, I guess.

01:33.880 --> 01:34.880
You're okay, you guess?

01:34.880 --> 01:37.600
Uh, feeling a little ripped off.

01:37.600 --> 01:38.600
What happened?

01:38.600 --> 01:43.200
Um, well just a company I've been buying, like, stuff from my new computer with, uh,

01:43.200 --> 01:47.960
EVGA, and I bought my motherboard and my graphics card from them.

01:47.960 --> 01:53.600
Uh, literally the day after I bought my graphics card, NVIDIA went and redesigned it.

01:53.600 --> 01:57.640
Made it cheaper, faster, and, um, better.

01:57.640 --> 01:58.920
So that sucks.

01:58.920 --> 02:06.760
And then, the motherboard that I bought doesn't have an onboard speaker, um, also doesn't

02:06.760 --> 02:12.800
have, some of the motherboards have these little LED readouts for error codes.

02:12.800 --> 02:14.480
So mine has none of that.

02:14.480 --> 02:19.840
So, go figure, I go to boot up my computer, and nothing comes up.

02:19.840 --> 02:22.400
So either the graphics card or the motherboard's broken.

02:22.400 --> 02:26.560
Of course, I can't tell what's wrong, since there's no beeps, nor indication of what's

02:26.560 --> 02:27.560
wrong.

02:27.560 --> 02:33.200
And, I'm looking at the motherboard that they sell on EVGA's site, and there's stuff missing

02:33.200 --> 02:34.200
off mine.

02:34.200 --> 02:40.200
Like, um, I don't know, a PCI express slot that's supposed to be there that's not, and

02:40.200 --> 02:45.000
uh, some other shit, so, they're gonna get an angry call tomorrow.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
Sorry to hear that.

02:46.000 --> 02:49.400
And now you just talked smack about them on your internet show, so, that's just lovely

02:49.400 --> 02:50.400
to know.

02:50.400 --> 02:51.400
Oh yeah, now they're feeling hurt.

02:51.400 --> 02:55.760
Our always present fourth guest here on the program, chat.orangelaungeradio.com, our chat

02:55.760 --> 02:58.840
room, we always tape live on Sunday nights, I know there's a lot of folks that listen

02:58.840 --> 03:04.120
to us in our taped form on the podcast, um, but, of course listening live is a whole other

03:04.120 --> 03:10.040
element where you get to, uh, do interactivity, um, question from AZHP, which graphics card

03:10.040 --> 03:11.040
was it?

03:11.040 --> 03:13.240
It's a 8800 GTS.

03:13.240 --> 03:15.240
That means nothing to me, I have no idea what that's about.

03:15.240 --> 03:19.480
It's a Nvidia card, they redesigned the GT, um, which made it a little bit faster using,

03:19.480 --> 03:25.680
you know, the 65, uh, nanometer chips, and now they did the same thing with the, uh,

03:25.680 --> 03:26.680
8800 GTS's.

03:26.680 --> 03:33.640
So, for example, I paid for my card, it was like, um, let's see here, I think it was about

03:33.640 --> 03:34.640
$364.99.

03:34.640 --> 03:35.640
Wow.

03:35.640 --> 03:40.560
Yeah, well that sounds, that's, that's quite a bit for a card.

03:40.560 --> 03:44.280
Well here's the best part though, cause see, now I can get an even faster card, I wanna

03:44.280 --> 03:47.560
save for about $100 cheaper.

03:47.560 --> 03:48.560
Which is annoying.

03:48.560 --> 03:56.000
I mean, it'll have, it'll have slightly less, um, graphics memory cause I had, uh, 640 megs

03:56.000 --> 04:03.360
of RAM on there, but let's see here, the one now, the GTS, uh, it'd be 512 megs of, um,

04:03.360 --> 04:08.880
RAM, and, okay, well it's not at that cheaper I guess, it's only, uh, it's $359.99, but

04:08.880 --> 04:12.840
still, okay, it's a little bit cheaper, and it's even faster.

04:12.840 --> 04:16.600
Alright, jeez, suddenly we're turning into the PC, uh, graphics card podcast, but that's

04:16.600 --> 04:20.440
alright cause I know there's a lot of PC gamers who, um, are really into this graphics card.

04:20.440 --> 04:23.800
For me, I just need something to play WoW on, but you all know about that addiction.

04:23.800 --> 04:27.220
Here's what I really wanna ask about though, uh, I noticed you brought one of your Xboxes

04:27.220 --> 04:29.480
with you tonight, I don't know if this is when you wanted to bring this up or not, but

04:29.480 --> 04:30.480
I'm bringing it up.

04:30.480 --> 04:31.480
Sure.

04:31.480 --> 04:33.940
You gotta show the OP11 people, I know this isn't great for the podcast, but we can kinda

04:33.940 --> 04:38.840
talk about this, you've got your Xbox modded, and I don't mean like the, you know, piracy

04:38.840 --> 04:40.840
mods or whatever, I mean the other ones.

04:40.840 --> 04:45.360
You have like a, you have like a glass thing on your Xbox, that's really cool.

04:45.360 --> 04:47.960
What is this, where did you buy this, why did you do this, can you, can we show this

04:47.960 --> 04:48.960
to the OP11 people?

04:48.960 --> 04:51.120
Um, I have to plug it in for it to look good.

04:51.120 --> 04:52.680
Oh, is it not plugged in?

04:52.680 --> 04:53.680
It's not plugged in right now.

04:53.680 --> 04:54.680
Oh, okay.

04:54.680 --> 04:55.680
Remember you said not to plug to me.

04:55.680 --> 04:57.440
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, alright, yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:57.440 --> 04:58.760
You know, I can plug it in real quick.

04:58.760 --> 05:00.520
Yeah, do it real quick, do it real quick.

05:00.520 --> 05:04.040
Hopefully we don't blow a circuit and the, uh, show comes to a screeching halt, but if

05:04.040 --> 05:05.700
we suddenly go off air, you know what happened.

05:05.700 --> 05:06.700
We, uh.

05:06.700 --> 05:08.400
Hey, if it explodes, it'll hit you guys first.

05:08.400 --> 05:09.400
It's, exactly.

05:09.400 --> 05:15.040
So, Jamie, maybe duck a little bit, uh, have Pyramid Head protect you with his blade while

05:15.040 --> 05:18.440
we do this, and hopefully the folks on cam can see this.

05:18.440 --> 05:24.240
Um, again, there's always, I, I think, I think the archives on OP11 are working again, so

05:24.240 --> 05:27.880
you might be able to see this in the archives on OP11, but yeah, you turn it on, and it

05:27.880 --> 05:31.080
glows blue inside, which I think is all kinds of awesome.

05:31.080 --> 05:35.080
It looks like, it's like how a lot of people have modded their PC cases to do.

05:35.080 --> 05:36.080
That's pretty rad.

05:36.080 --> 05:42.040
Um, okay, I guess the folks in chat have seen enough of that, so, uh, what exactly, why,

05:42.040 --> 05:43.040
why did you do that?

05:43.040 --> 05:44.520
Was it just for the challenge, or what was it?

05:44.520 --> 05:49.160
Let me, uh, Loki's not near a microphone.

05:49.160 --> 05:52.240
Excellent live radio.

05:52.240 --> 05:57.240
I understand ya.

05:57.240 --> 06:02.180
So why exactly did you, um, decide to mod this and make it blue in there?

06:02.180 --> 06:03.180
Because it's cool.

06:03.180 --> 06:07.520
You just, you just wanted something the other kids didn't have, right?

06:07.520 --> 06:08.520
Exactly.

06:08.520 --> 06:09.520
Alright.

06:09.520 --> 06:12.520
I just, um, I did it to, well, three of them so far.

06:12.520 --> 06:16.040
I still have one more that I haven't done yet, because they're a bitch.

06:16.040 --> 06:19.120
To be honest, though, it may look cool, but it sucks.

06:19.120 --> 06:20.120
Why is that?

06:20.120 --> 06:26.360
Um, the brand of clear case I bought, which I think it was like a ghost case or something

06:26.360 --> 06:29.160
like that, uh, they suck.

06:29.160 --> 06:31.200
They don't fit right.

06:31.200 --> 06:35.560
So for example, you'll notice that one has still the old faceplate on it.

06:35.560 --> 06:37.400
Well, there's a clear faceplate for it.

06:37.400 --> 06:40.080
The problem is it jams DVD drive.

06:40.080 --> 06:43.200
Now, Tigerclaw has a very good point in our chatroom.

06:43.200 --> 06:48.160
Modding the 360 may be cool, but it also voids the warranty, so you just, you know, you don't

06:48.160 --> 06:50.120
care about the warranty, you'll just take your chances.

06:50.120 --> 06:51.880
Yeah, just like I did the other one.

06:51.880 --> 06:54.040
That one was modded in the other way, so.

06:54.040 --> 06:55.040
I see.

06:55.040 --> 06:56.600
Alright, well, we'll get into that a little later.

06:56.600 --> 06:57.600
Let's go around and check.

06:57.600 --> 07:00.880
Well, and then, yeah, we'll also, we'll have, you know, the wonderful Christmas light effect

07:00.880 --> 07:05.320
on there, since it's got the flashing green, er, three flashing lights on it.

07:05.320 --> 07:06.320
It's awesome.

07:06.320 --> 07:07.320
Alright.

07:07.320 --> 07:08.320
The red rings of death.

07:08.320 --> 07:09.320
Hooray!

07:09.320 --> 07:10.320
Congratulations on that.

07:10.320 --> 07:14.040
Uh, let's, let's go around and ask the question about our gaming weeks, because that's how

07:14.040 --> 07:17.600
we're supposed to start off the show before we get into ooh and aah-ing over a blue 360.

07:17.600 --> 07:20.120
Uh, Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week?

07:20.120 --> 07:23.640
Um, I had a Christmas present last night.

07:23.640 --> 07:25.240
I have Portal.

07:25.240 --> 07:26.240
Sweet!

07:26.240 --> 07:30.200
Yeah, and I knew that, I totally knew Dan got it for me, because I checked our online

07:30.200 --> 07:35.540
banking, and I saw that, um, he had already told me how much it was used at his store,

07:35.540 --> 07:38.920
and then I saw that much come out of the bank spent at GameCrazy.

07:38.920 --> 07:43.880
And then, that day, I felt a game in my stocking.

07:43.880 --> 07:46.400
I didn't take it out, but I knew what it was.

07:46.400 --> 07:51.480
And so, last night, um, I went in there, um, and was just, uh, playing around with him,

07:51.480 --> 07:57.800
and, uh, our friend, well, his friend Will was visiting, and we, uh, Dan said, oh, and

07:57.800 --> 08:02.460
by the way, and took it out of my, uh, stocking, and I was like, hey, cool!

08:02.460 --> 08:07.160
And then they were taunting me with it, and then I got it back, and so, uh, Dan, like,

08:07.160 --> 08:09.480
was gonna play, like, a level.

08:09.480 --> 08:14.040
He ended up playing, like, up to, uh, the Weighted Companion Cube level.

08:14.040 --> 08:15.040
Nice.

08:15.040 --> 08:16.040
It's addicting!

08:16.040 --> 08:17.040
Yeah.

08:17.040 --> 08:19.640
And, um, it was pretty funny.

08:19.640 --> 08:21.600
He was, he was very silly.

08:21.600 --> 08:28.080
And then, um, I, uh, played World Cup soccer pinball last night, because I hadn't played

08:28.080 --> 08:33.520
any pinball in a week, and lots of Ragnarok.

08:33.520 --> 08:34.520
And a little Olendan.

08:34.520 --> 08:35.520
Very cool.

08:35.520 --> 08:40.160
Hey, I gotta ask you, though, um, since, you know, you, you put on your investigative hat

08:40.160 --> 08:43.840
to find out that your husband had bought you the, uh, orange box for Christmas, were you

08:43.840 --> 08:47.560
the type of child that looked under the bed for what mom got you for Christmas, or what?

08:47.560 --> 08:52.520
No, first of all, mom kept everything in the closet, and then, second of all, I, the only

08:52.520 --> 08:53.520
reason...

08:53.520 --> 08:58.920
I like how you know, you have to correct me, like, no, if I wanted to look at the presents,

08:58.920 --> 08:59.920
I went to the closet.

08:59.920 --> 09:03.440
Well, that's cause, that's where she kept them, cause my mom was not creative.

09:03.440 --> 09:10.560
Um, but, I happened to be checking the online banking to see if my bonus got in, and that's

09:10.560 --> 09:11.600
why I was looking.

09:11.600 --> 09:17.720
And then I saw, forty-something dollars spent at Game Crazy, I'm like, oh, gee, who's been

09:17.720 --> 09:22.560
the one talking about wanting orange box for Christmas, and there it was.

09:22.560 --> 09:27.960
So that's when I, I got my investigative hat on when the clue presented itself.

09:27.960 --> 09:28.960
Very nice.

09:28.960 --> 09:31.800
Did I ever tell you the story about when I got my Super Nintendo when I was twelve?

09:31.800 --> 09:34.080
I don't know if I've told the story on this program, actually I might have been eleven,

09:34.080 --> 09:38.720
I don't remember, but I asked for that for Christmas, and that's all I really wanted,

09:38.720 --> 09:40.320
was the Super Nintendo, right?

09:40.320 --> 09:44.320
And so we opened up all the presents under the tree, and, you know, I saved the big,

09:44.320 --> 09:47.960
big present for last, cause I, I kinda guessed that maybe it was the Super Nintendo I wanted

09:47.960 --> 09:49.240
for Christmas, right?

09:49.240 --> 09:53.120
And so I opened the very last present, and it's a San Francisco Giants jacket.

09:53.120 --> 09:54.120
Ah!

09:54.120 --> 09:56.760
And if you know me, you know I love sports.

09:56.760 --> 10:00.040
So I was, like, crushed, and I was, like, about ready to cry, you know, I didn't, I

10:00.040 --> 10:02.680
didn't want to cry cause I didn't want to look like a baby, but, you know, inside the

10:02.680 --> 10:05.920
gamer nerd in me is, like, wanting to cry and sob and throw things, be the spoiled brat

10:05.920 --> 10:06.920
I am, right?

10:06.920 --> 10:11.680
Well then, finally, after everybody opens their present, presents, my sister comes to

10:11.680 --> 10:16.680
me with one tiny, tiny, tiny little gift and says, there's one more thing, and on it was

10:16.680 --> 10:21.560
written on an index card, um, a hint, and so I had to find where the next index card

10:21.560 --> 10:25.000
was, and where the next card was, the next card, and finally about five times it took

10:25.000 --> 10:27.640
me, like, out in the garage or something up in the rafters and that's where the Super

10:27.640 --> 10:28.640
Nintendo was.

10:28.640 --> 10:29.640
That's cool.

10:29.640 --> 10:33.600
And so the moral of the story is I get what I want, cause I'm a spoiled brat.

10:33.600 --> 10:37.180
And I got a Super Nintendo with Super Mario World, and then they bought one more game

10:37.180 --> 10:38.180
for me, right?

10:38.180 --> 10:39.680
You know what game they ended up getting for me?

10:39.680 --> 10:45.140
A game called Drakken, which I don't think anybody ever played, but the reason, it was

10:45.140 --> 10:49.360
based on an old PC game, and it wasn't bad, the sequel to it, which I believe was called

10:49.360 --> 10:53.760
Dungeon View, Drakken 2, was awesome, but the first one was a little meh, cause it was

10:53.760 --> 10:57.920
a role-playing game where you didn't really control your characters at all, you just kinda

10:57.920 --> 11:02.000
hoped they would beat the monster in their own way, it was really odd, it was kinda neat

11:02.000 --> 11:06.400
I guess in its own way, but the reason why they bought that, because the guy at Sears

11:06.400 --> 11:12.280
told them it was a big seller, and I'm like, okay, to this day, nobody, like, fucking knows

11:12.280 --> 11:13.280
Drakken.

11:13.280 --> 11:19.960
I remember when we bought a PC from Sears a long time ago, or thinking about it, no,

11:19.960 --> 11:21.880
that was crap.

11:21.880 --> 11:23.880
Never buy PCs from them.

11:23.880 --> 11:26.760
I'm looking at comments from chat, this is good.

11:26.760 --> 11:31.400
Tiger Claw says Drakken was a 3D RPG, so I'm not the only one that knows what Drakken is,

11:31.400 --> 11:33.920
I'm sure there's other listeners that go, I remember that game.

11:33.920 --> 11:38.360
Amaze Satsuma, I like this, says, when I was younger, I wasn't only the type to hunt for

11:38.360 --> 11:43.320
my Christmas, I also opened the game boxes and replaced the game inside with the game

11:43.320 --> 11:45.960
I already own.

11:45.960 --> 11:47.840
That's messed up.

11:47.840 --> 11:55.120
Actually, another year, my mom went to Target and got all this stuff, and I was like, looking

11:55.120 --> 11:59.160
in the bags, when she came back from Target, not like intentionally, I wasn't really hunting

11:59.160 --> 12:02.000
around for Christmas presents, I was actually looking for candy, like, I wanted to see if

12:02.000 --> 12:06.100
she bought candy, because I wanted candy, and I freaking saw a copy of Fester's Quest

12:06.100 --> 12:11.140
on the NES in one of the bags, and I was like, oh, crap, but then I decided to screw with

12:11.140 --> 12:15.120
my mom later, because we went to the video store and I wanted to rent a game, so I grabbed

12:15.120 --> 12:18.240
the box for Fester's Quest, I'm like, let me rent this game, let me rent this game,

12:18.240 --> 12:22.480
and my mom's like, no, you don't need to rent a game tonight.

12:22.480 --> 12:23.480
I'm such a bastard.

12:23.480 --> 12:25.720
Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?

12:25.720 --> 12:28.120
It was okay.

12:28.120 --> 12:33.800
Let's see, I played Saints Row again, more of that, and I played a little bit of Rock

12:33.800 --> 12:39.880
Band last night, actually, that was pretty fun, played more of the drums for that, and

12:39.880 --> 12:48.120
then, let's see, Burnout Paradise Demo, it's okay, I like it a lot better than some of

12:48.120 --> 12:52.720
the other Burnout games, because you get to kind of free drive around the city and then

12:52.720 --> 12:57.760
you start events, whatever, definitely don't recommend playing on a small TV, as we were

12:57.760 --> 13:03.040
doing before the show, but it's pretty good otherwise.

13:03.040 --> 13:11.360
I like the way the crashes look, I don't know, it's a little hard to see where the shortcuts

13:11.360 --> 13:16.080
and stuff are in the game, but I guess that's why you gotta drive around more and stuff,

13:16.080 --> 13:20.240
but I'll probably pick it up when it comes out in January, and then, let's see, other

13:20.240 --> 13:26.440
than that, I think a little bit more Zelda Phantom Hourglass, pretty much done with that

13:26.440 --> 13:27.440
game now.

13:27.440 --> 13:28.440
Oh, very cool.

13:28.440 --> 13:36.720
Would have been playing Crysis if my computer hadn't fucking sucked, stupid EVGA.

13:36.720 --> 13:40.560
My gaming week, you know, kind of the usual stuff, been playing more World of Warcraft,

13:40.560 --> 13:43.520
of course, Geometry Wars Galaxies, I've been getting a little further in, which I talked

13:43.520 --> 13:48.960
about last week, fucking around with some of the stuff on the Wii, like Pokemon Snap,

13:48.960 --> 13:54.080
awesome, you really can save pictures to the Wii message board, it kind of took me a little

13:54.080 --> 13:58.480
bit to figure out how to do it, but basically if you have Pokemon Snap, you take the pictures,

13:58.480 --> 14:02.820
by the way, Pokemon Snap doesn't control quite as nice as I remember it, like the controls

14:02.820 --> 14:05.120
are kind of shitty, but the game itself is fun.

14:05.120 --> 14:08.600
You know, you take the pictures of the Pokemon, right, and you can save your favorites to

14:08.600 --> 14:10.200
this gallery.

14:10.200 --> 14:14.960
If you back out all the way to the main menu and then go into gallery, you can look at

14:14.960 --> 14:20.040
the pictures you took, but the Nintendo 64 kind of up-reses them from when you took them

14:20.040 --> 14:24.480
in game to I guess the highest quality picture the Nintendo 64 could render.

14:24.480 --> 14:29.360
When you're in that mode, you hit the minus key on your classic controller, and that is

14:29.360 --> 14:35.080
what will post your picture to the Wii message board, and you can only post one a day, but

14:35.080 --> 14:38.800
you can send the pictures, like I took a picture and I didn't know who to send it to, so I

14:38.800 --> 14:42.520
sent it to Bobby Blackwolf because I thought he'd get a kick out of it, because something

14:42.520 --> 14:46.080
told me Bobby's probably not a Pokemon Snap fan, so I took a dumb little picture of like

14:46.080 --> 14:49.520
Pikachu or something and sent it to Bobby, so hopefully he got it.

14:49.520 --> 14:52.520
I don't know, I didn't hear his show tonight to see if he said that he got any mail from

14:52.520 --> 14:54.520
me, but we'll see.

14:54.520 --> 14:57.760
I think that's a cute little feature, but you can only do that once a day, which is

14:57.760 --> 15:01.560
kind of weird, but I'm assuming that must be the way the files are saved within the

15:01.560 --> 15:02.560
Wii message board.

15:02.560 --> 15:05.800
You don't want to fill up the hard drive with all these crappy Pokemon pictures, but that's

15:05.800 --> 15:06.800
kind of cool.

15:06.800 --> 15:10.880
Okay, VX JasonXVR, a webmaster, wants me to send the picture to him, so I will do that

15:10.880 --> 15:12.680
a little later, absolutely.

15:12.680 --> 15:15.020
And he's doing the Check Me Out channel.

15:15.020 --> 15:18.400
Some other stuff I've looked at, I actually looked at this last week, but I forgot to

15:18.400 --> 15:19.400
mention it on the show.

15:19.400 --> 15:24.720
Xbox 360, a little demo came out for a game called Cultsep Saga, and the thing about Cultsep

15:24.720 --> 15:29.760
is it was kind of like a cult game, if you will, on the PlayStation 2, where not a lot

15:29.760 --> 15:32.840
of people had heard of it or played it, but it's a great game.

15:32.840 --> 15:39.160
I love Cultsep on the PlayStation 2, and if you've read any reviews about this game, most

15:39.160 --> 15:41.480
of the reviews on it are pretty accurate.

15:41.480 --> 15:46.160
It's Monopoly meets Magic the Gathering, where you're moving around this board, and you're

15:46.160 --> 15:51.320
trying to collect the most magical points, and you do that by laying these monsters down,

15:51.320 --> 15:54.740
and when opponents land on the square where you've put down a monster, they can either

15:54.740 --> 15:58.420
challenge the monster with one of their own monsters, or pay a toll, like, you know, you're

15:58.420 --> 16:01.080
paying boardwalk, so they have to pay with some of their magic.

16:01.080 --> 16:06.920
So that's basically the gist of the game, and I think it translated the 360 pretty nicely.

16:06.920 --> 16:11.080
The only downside is that in playing, you know, obviously it's only the demo, I'm basing

16:11.080 --> 16:14.820
my assumptions off the demo, but the demo appeared to be one of the exact same boards

16:14.820 --> 16:17.860
from the PlayStation 2 version, I think the very first board, and it does look like there's

16:17.860 --> 16:22.480
some more cards and things, but really it looks like all they've done on the 360 is

16:22.480 --> 16:27.060
made it widescreen and up-resed everything to 720p, because when you're in the battles,

16:27.060 --> 16:31.240
the cards do these cheesy little animations, like if you have a fighter attacking something,

16:31.240 --> 16:36.520
a giant sword will swing and cut the card in half, or if you have these wolves attacking

16:36.520 --> 16:42.000
whatever, giant jaws will descend on the other card, it's so cheesy, and you'd think they

16:42.000 --> 16:45.240
would have changed some of that for the Xbox 360, like maybe they could have had these

16:45.240 --> 16:49.920
really cool cutscene battles with the cards, but they didn't do it for whatever reason,

16:49.920 --> 16:56.240
so I imagine the biggest draw to this game is going to be the Xbox Live Play, which I

16:56.240 --> 16:58.960
can't imagine this game doesn't have, I mean I don't know for sure if it's in there, but

16:58.960 --> 17:02.880
I can't imagine it doesn't, because you weren't able to do that on the PlayStation 2 version,

17:02.880 --> 17:06.640
but it's a fun game, I like that game a lot.

17:06.640 --> 17:10.880
RossdielUT says, Skye, seriously, this even sounds boring.

17:10.880 --> 17:15.760
It's not for somebody who likes a fast action paced game, but if something like Puzzle Quest

17:15.760 --> 17:20.160
is more up your alley, or something you think before you make your moves and stuff like

17:20.160 --> 17:25.880
that, it's fun, it's certainly not fast paced, so there you have it.

17:25.880 --> 17:30.640
Speaking of card games, I just wanted to mention, I vaguely remember the amount, because it

17:30.640 --> 17:37.400
wasn't that much, but a little update to the Eye of Judgment sales in the US, I think we

17:37.400 --> 17:44.160
sold yet another 17,000 units last month, so we're up to a whopping 32,000-ish around

17:44.160 --> 17:45.160
there.

17:45.160 --> 17:49.240
So 32,000 Eye of Judgment units sold, and the goal is, again, 1 million for Loki to

17:49.240 --> 17:50.560
wear the tingle suit here on the program.

17:50.560 --> 17:54.680
Good luck with that, I don't think he'll sell 1 million, period.

17:54.680 --> 17:58.920
One other quick assessment, a game I completely judged based off the demo alone, which I know

17:58.920 --> 18:01.600
is a big no-no, but I'm just putting that out there in front.

18:01.600 --> 18:06.800
That new arcade release this week on Xbox, Arcadian Warriors, is that what it's called?

18:06.800 --> 18:11.240
It's kind of like Diablo, which is pretty rad, because I think a game like Diablo would

18:11.240 --> 18:15.840
be rad on Xbox 360, but I couldn't help but feel like it was just a bit of button mashing,

18:15.840 --> 18:19.160
and I don't know if that's just because Fighter is the only class you can play in the demo.

18:19.160 --> 18:26.400
I love the idea of a quest RPG fantasy type of game on Xbox Live Arcade, but this didn't

18:26.400 --> 18:29.840
make me go, oh, I've got to buy the full game.

18:29.840 --> 18:33.240
I love the fact that when I was kind of first playing it, I was like, wow, this is kind

18:33.240 --> 18:36.080
of like Diablo, but then as I was playing it more and more, I was like, wow, this is

18:36.080 --> 18:37.520
kind of repetitive.

18:37.520 --> 18:43.840
So I don't know, I wish a friend of mine had the full version so I could get a taste of

18:43.840 --> 18:46.520
what some of the other classes play like, but unfortunately that's not the way it's

18:46.520 --> 18:47.520
set up.

18:47.520 --> 18:48.520
So there it is.

18:48.520 --> 18:51.840
All right, well, that's it for our gaming weeks.

18:51.840 --> 18:54.760
No special guests in the studio tonight, just the three of us.

18:54.760 --> 18:55.760
And Harvey.

18:55.760 --> 18:56.760
All right.

18:56.760 --> 18:57.760
Who's Harvey?

18:57.760 --> 18:58.760
He's the giant rabbit.

18:58.760 --> 18:59.760
The giant rabbit?

18:59.760 --> 19:04.360
Well, we have some of our, we have Pikachu and Kirby behind us and Cartman.

19:04.360 --> 19:05.360
That's rude.

19:05.360 --> 19:08.600
And the cleared up in chat room, yeah, the 32,000 was domestic sales.

19:08.600 --> 19:10.200
I have no idea what it's selling worldwide.

19:10.200 --> 19:15.160
I can guarantee, though, it's not anything over 100,000 units already, so.

19:15.160 --> 19:20.160
I'm fairly confident that, you know, it's never going to sell a million units.

19:20.160 --> 19:25.400
Ross Steel UT in chat says, kind of like Diablo equals kind of repetitive, am I right?

19:25.400 --> 19:26.400
I don't know.

19:26.400 --> 19:30.160
I didn't get that same feeling from Diablo, but I think a lot of the strength that Diablo

19:30.160 --> 19:34.600
had was the multiplayer mode, and to be fair, I didn't get to try that mode out on this

19:34.600 --> 19:39.000
demo yet, so maybe that's where this game shines is being able to do multiplayer.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.920
That might make the game a hell of a lot more fun, so that's why I put that disclaimer out

19:41.920 --> 19:42.920
there.

19:42.920 --> 19:44.720
I'm completely basing my judgment of this game off the demo.

19:44.720 --> 19:47.840
But then again, that's what a lot of Xbox users do, so if you're going to put a demo

19:47.840 --> 19:51.920
out there, you know, make sure it sells everything the game's got in it, right?

19:51.920 --> 19:52.920
Am I right?

19:52.920 --> 19:53.920
Yeah.

19:53.920 --> 19:57.000
In fact, I think I'm going to change the bet a little bit to make it a little bit more

19:57.000 --> 19:59.520
fair for everybody.

19:59.520 --> 20:05.280
If the game ever sells a million units, and this could be like five years from now, it'll

20:05.280 --> 20:06.280
still happen.

20:06.280 --> 20:07.280
Okay?

20:07.280 --> 20:08.280
Wow.

20:08.280 --> 20:09.280
Ever.

20:09.280 --> 20:12.360
Loki's given a little on the bet and says if the game can ever sell a million, a million

20:12.360 --> 20:13.420
worldwide even?

20:13.420 --> 20:14.420
Million worldwide.

20:14.420 --> 20:15.420
Alright, nice.

20:15.420 --> 20:20.320
If the game can sell a million worldwide ever, then Loki will wear the Tingle Suit.

20:20.320 --> 20:24.520
Watch one of our listeners win the lottery and buy 900,000 of them, just watch it.

20:24.520 --> 20:26.640
So it might be like three years from now.

20:26.640 --> 20:30.560
I hope we're still doing this show three years from now or, you know, that could happen like

20:30.560 --> 20:33.760
in 30 years and Loki's, you know, getting old going, what do you mean I gotta wear this

20:33.760 --> 20:34.760
suit?

20:34.760 --> 20:35.760
Alright.

20:35.760 --> 20:36.760
I have judgment.

20:36.760 --> 20:38.760
I don't remember that game.

20:38.760 --> 20:40.760
What the fuck?

20:40.760 --> 20:41.760
Alright.

20:41.760 --> 20:48.280
Let's get into some housekeeping tonight before we start tonight's news of the gaming type.

20:48.280 --> 20:49.640
There is no show next week.

20:49.640 --> 20:50.640
We're not gonna be here next week.

20:50.640 --> 20:55.680
We're taking December 23rd off for the holidays because Dark Soccer, myself and Loki all have,

20:55.680 --> 20:57.760
you know, family and friends stuff to attend to.

20:57.760 --> 20:59.880
So we're not gonna be here on December the 23rd.

20:59.880 --> 21:04.960
However, for those of you that listen live, it is my understanding there is a very special

21:04.960 --> 21:11.080
OLR Christmas that's gonna happen thanks to some of our other OLR personalities, so stay

21:11.080 --> 21:12.280
tuned for that.

21:12.280 --> 21:16.520
That will not hit the podcast feed, but it will go up on our MySpace and our live journal

21:16.520 --> 21:19.060
and Facebook and all the fan communities we have.

21:19.060 --> 21:23.200
You will still be able to grab a recorded copy of whatever mischief happens on the station

21:23.200 --> 21:25.660
next Sunday, which I'm sure is gonna be very interesting.

21:25.660 --> 21:30.500
We will be back on December 30th for our year-end special, and more to come on the website.

21:30.500 --> 21:33.000
About that, a little closer to the day.

21:33.000 --> 21:36.240
Also, I need to wish one of our listeners.

21:36.240 --> 21:40.280
Sephiroth1215 had a birthday yesterday, so I'm supposed to say happy birthday.

21:40.280 --> 21:42.860
And I know he's been a longtime listener of the show and has come out and met him in New

21:42.860 --> 21:46.740
York City on some of the OLR meetups and stuff, so happy birthday!

21:46.740 --> 21:47.740
Happy birthday.

21:47.740 --> 21:48.740
Thank your mother.

21:48.740 --> 21:49.740
Thank your mother.

21:49.740 --> 21:50.740
Yes.

21:50.740 --> 21:51.740
For having you.

21:51.740 --> 21:52.740
Yes.

21:52.740 --> 21:53.740
For giving birth.

21:53.740 --> 21:54.740
Good idea.

21:54.740 --> 21:55.740
All right.

21:55.740 --> 21:56.740
Anyways.

21:56.740 --> 21:57.740
Gaming news time, yes?

21:57.740 --> 21:58.740
Yes.

21:58.740 --> 21:59.740
All right.

21:59.740 --> 22:00.740
So starting the show off here.

22:00.740 --> 22:01.740
Guitar Hero 3.

22:01.740 --> 22:05.400
It's getting a brand new patch to fix a few things and add a couple things.

22:05.400 --> 22:12.000
Some of the things that they're fixing, improving the online quick match results, and also adding

22:12.000 --> 22:15.520
a calibration screen improvements, I guess.

22:15.520 --> 22:17.240
So that's kinda cool.

22:17.240 --> 22:22.520
And also, one of the things that they're adding for PlayStation 3 users, the co-op quick play

22:22.520 --> 22:23.520
mode.

22:23.520 --> 22:28.880
So, other than that, various other stability improvements and fixes.

22:28.880 --> 22:32.440
I wish they'd add some new characters or something.

22:32.440 --> 22:33.440
I don't know.

22:33.440 --> 22:34.440
I don't know.

22:34.440 --> 22:39.840
But, other than that also, there's also going to be a new download pack, and they've added

22:39.840 --> 22:46.400
two different ones, one of which is from the Warner Reprise track pack, I guess.

22:46.400 --> 22:53.320
And that's going to include Pretty Handsome Awkward by The Used, Sleeping Giant by Mastodon,

22:53.320 --> 22:55.920
and No More Sorrow by Linkin Park.

22:55.920 --> 23:04.320
Also, they have single download packs, including some, I guess, from popular European bands.

23:04.320 --> 23:15.640
So Peyoso by Extremaduro, and Antisocial by Trust, and Erton Was We're Sayin' by Durf

23:15.640 --> 23:16.640
and Fantisian Vere.

23:16.640 --> 23:17.640
I don't know.

23:17.640 --> 23:19.160
I probably butchered all that stuff.

23:19.160 --> 23:24.920
And then, I guess, a free exclusive rock rendition of a holiday classic, We Three Kings by Steve

23:24.920 --> 23:25.920
Oymette.

23:25.920 --> 23:28.120
You know what's kind of funny, though?

23:28.120 --> 23:31.400
I would have hoped that they would have had more Christmas songs and stuff, like get the

23:31.400 --> 23:36.200
London Symphony Orchestra or something like that stuff in there, or the Trans-Siberian

23:36.200 --> 23:37.200
Orchestra.

23:37.200 --> 23:38.200
That has that.

23:38.200 --> 23:39.200
Twisted Sister Christmas.

23:39.200 --> 23:40.200
I like that idea.

23:40.200 --> 23:41.200
Twisted Sister Christmas.

23:41.200 --> 23:44.320
A friend of mine's been linking me to a lot of the songs on them because someone uploaded

23:44.320 --> 23:45.320
them on YouTube.

23:45.320 --> 23:49.080
But seriously, though, Trans-Siberian Orchestra, that would be perfect.

23:49.080 --> 23:50.760
You can even do that as a free download pack.

23:50.760 --> 23:51.760
I like free.

23:51.760 --> 23:52.760
Free is good.

23:52.760 --> 23:53.760
Especially for Christmas.

23:53.760 --> 23:54.760
Come on.

23:54.760 --> 23:55.760
Or the holidays.

23:55.760 --> 23:56.760
Sorry.

23:56.760 --> 23:57.760
We have to say the politically correct term.

23:57.760 --> 23:58.760
The holidays.

23:58.760 --> 24:05.800
Credit to Activision or Harmonix, I'm going to say Activision, for actually giving a free

24:05.800 --> 24:09.720
song for Guitar Hero 3.

24:09.720 --> 24:14.120
But the rest of those packs, of course, is going to be $6.25.

24:14.120 --> 24:15.360
There you have it.

24:15.360 --> 24:18.760
Now here's why I never wish listeners a happy birthday on the program, because of course

24:18.760 --> 24:23.240
now we had someone else pipe up and Footy Monster says, it was my birthday last week

24:23.240 --> 24:25.240
too.

24:25.240 --> 24:26.600
Happy birthday, Footy Monster.

24:26.600 --> 24:31.160
In fact, just so we don't get any more emails going, it was my birthday, it was my birthday,

24:31.160 --> 24:32.280
and all that stuff.

24:32.280 --> 24:36.680
If you had a birthday between December 9th and December 15th, which would have been last

24:36.680 --> 24:40.640
week, or today, December 16th, happy birthday to you.

24:40.640 --> 24:43.360
The rest of you, sit on it and wait for your turn.

24:43.360 --> 24:45.080
Just to you a few.

24:45.080 --> 24:47.160
Happy unbirthday to you.

24:47.160 --> 24:48.680
All right.

24:48.680 --> 24:52.960
Speaking of Guitar Hero and Rock Band, there's drama.

24:52.960 --> 24:57.960
I mean, it's like these two are having some real drama, pillow fights and everything between

24:57.960 --> 24:58.960
them.

24:58.960 --> 24:59.960
But here it is.

24:59.960 --> 25:02.560
You know how, of course, there's the compatibility issues with the guitar.

25:02.560 --> 25:06.420
Well, what was supposed to happen is that Rock Band was going to get an update on the

25:06.420 --> 25:10.800
PlayStation 3 so that the Guitar Hero 3 controller will work with it.

25:10.800 --> 25:16.240
Well, it didn't happen, and Harmonix took to their forums to explain the reason why.

25:16.240 --> 25:20.040
Two weeks ago, Harmonix created a software patch for the Sony PlayStation 3 version of

25:20.040 --> 25:25.120
Rock Band that allowed for guitar compatibility and support for third-party peripherals, including

25:25.120 --> 25:29.240
enabling use of Activision's Guitar Hero 3 controller with Rock Band.

25:29.240 --> 25:32.520
The compatibility patch was submitted, approved, and had been scheduled for release by Sony

25:32.520 --> 25:34.320
on Tuesday, December 4th.

25:34.320 --> 25:38.200
Unfortunately, Activision objected to the compatibility patch's release.

25:38.200 --> 25:42.680
The patch remains with Sony, but we have been told that it will unfortunately not be released

25:42.680 --> 25:45.360
due to Activision's continued objection.

25:45.360 --> 25:47.840
So, you know, boo Activision to doing that.

25:47.840 --> 25:54.120
I'm sure they had their own reasons, money, motivating people to just go out and buy little

25:54.120 --> 25:55.120
wine bitches.

25:55.120 --> 25:56.120
I don't know.

25:56.120 --> 25:57.120
I don't know.

25:57.120 --> 25:58.120
That's kind of too bad.

25:58.120 --> 26:02.160
Well, did you see the whole thing where Activision was blaming Harmonix for that, saying it's

26:02.160 --> 26:03.160
their fault?

26:03.160 --> 26:04.360
Because that's kind of stupid.

26:04.360 --> 26:05.360
No.

26:05.360 --> 26:06.360
What happened to that?

26:06.360 --> 26:07.360
So, Activision followed up and said, no, it's Harmonix's fault.

26:07.360 --> 26:08.360
It's their fault.

26:08.360 --> 26:09.840
I don't even remember the reasoning why.

26:09.840 --> 26:12.640
I'm like, well, why would they not do that?

26:12.640 --> 26:17.000
Is it their fault because they left, you know, Activision to make a game with another company?

26:17.000 --> 26:18.000
Is that why?

26:18.000 --> 26:19.400
It's your fault that you left.

26:19.400 --> 26:24.720
I mean, it's like getting caught in the middle of exes fighting, and that's never any fun.

26:24.720 --> 26:27.800
Like, I don't know if you've been in that situation where you're caught in the middle

26:27.800 --> 26:31.000
of these two exes, but that's what it feels like, and you know what?

26:31.000 --> 26:35.440
We all lose when that happens, so boo to everybody involved for not being able to kiss and make

26:35.440 --> 26:36.440
up.

26:36.440 --> 26:39.580
There's a lot more whiny bitchery happening.

26:39.580 --> 26:45.840
There is a class action lawsuit now going on against Activision for the whole mono sound

26:45.840 --> 26:49.720
on the Wii edition of Guitar Hero 3.

26:49.720 --> 26:55.840
They're saying that they willfully deceived the consumer with a statement that it had

26:55.840 --> 27:00.400
Dolby Pro Logic 2 surround sound instead of mono.

27:00.400 --> 27:05.160
There's a universe of difference between Dolby and mono.

27:05.160 --> 27:06.160
So

27:06.160 --> 27:09.280
It's a scam, but still, lawsuit?

27:09.280 --> 27:16.400
Well, you know they've promised to put out replacement discs that have the sound issue

27:16.400 --> 27:18.400
corrected?

27:18.400 --> 27:20.720
Activision's not making any comment, though.

27:20.720 --> 27:26.520
I don't think that they really, it's in their best interest to make a comment at this time.

27:26.520 --> 27:28.360
Not while they're going through litigation.

27:28.360 --> 27:31.960
Probably not, especially when they're trying to fix things, but I would think if anybody

27:31.960 --> 27:36.040
wants to bring the smackdown on Activision, it ought to be Nintendo.

27:36.040 --> 27:38.760
Not the consumer suing them in this whole thing.

27:38.760 --> 27:43.280
I don't think the consumer is suing Nintendo, I think they're suing Activision.

27:43.280 --> 27:46.940
Yeah, but I'm saying if anybody should put the smackdown on Activision, it ought to be

27:46.940 --> 27:52.000
Nintendo, because Nintendo should go to Activision and go, you gave us a subpar version of the

27:52.000 --> 27:55.520
game, then what you gave the other systems, naughty, naughty, naughty, you know, that

27:55.520 --> 27:56.520
whole thing.

27:56.520 --> 27:58.880
I wouldn't be surprised if they would do something too.

27:58.880 --> 28:01.240
Everything's a subpar version on the Wii.

28:01.240 --> 28:02.240
I guess that's true.

28:02.240 --> 28:03.240
I disagree.

28:03.240 --> 28:07.160
It's not just powerful, I mean in terms of graphics, so you have that whole thing as

28:07.160 --> 28:08.160
well.

28:08.160 --> 28:11.320
No, look at like, okay, look for example, Far Cry, Instincts on the Wii.

28:11.320 --> 28:12.320
It was crap.

28:12.320 --> 28:15.960
It had two player deathmatch, woohoo, two players.

28:15.960 --> 28:20.900
Wow, you really pushed yourselves there, and you know, some of the other control issues

28:20.900 --> 28:26.840
that they have, a lot of crappy ports of games, I'm looking at you Ubisoft, and I don't know,

28:26.840 --> 28:28.280
overall they just don't care.

28:28.280 --> 28:31.460
You see, the problem is also I think a lot of these people are used to putting out crappy

28:31.460 --> 28:36.200
games without, you know, quality checking them very thoroughly because they can patch

28:36.200 --> 28:39.840
them now on the PlayStation 3 and the, you know, Xbox 360.

28:39.840 --> 28:43.280
I guess it's Nintendo's fault for not having a wonderful patch system so they can release

28:43.280 --> 28:45.520
this crap and then fix it later.

28:45.520 --> 28:49.560
Oh well, anyways.

28:49.560 --> 28:54.320
One thing that's also going to need to be fixed is getting Rock Band to Canada.

28:54.320 --> 28:59.200
Luckily though, they have confirmed now that Rock Band will be coming to Canada December

28:59.200 --> 29:00.680
20th.

29:00.680 --> 29:06.440
So a slight delay from, I don't know, November 20th, but at least you'll be able to play

29:06.440 --> 29:07.640
it.

29:07.640 --> 29:08.640
Hopefully you can find a copy.

29:08.640 --> 29:12.740
Oh yeah, if you're waiting for the PlayStation 2 version in Canada, well they haven't really

29:12.740 --> 29:16.160
confirmed on when that's coming too, so.

29:16.160 --> 29:19.360
But seriously, why settle for Rock Band on the PlayStation 2?

29:19.360 --> 29:21.920
Because with the amount you're going to pay for that, you really ought to just put that

29:21.920 --> 29:23.520
down towards another console, right?

29:23.520 --> 29:24.800
Am I right?

29:24.800 --> 29:26.100
Well, here's the thing.

29:26.100 --> 29:31.220
If you do buy it on PlayStation 2, at least if you do get a new console later that happens

29:31.220 --> 29:36.760
to be PlayStation 3, you can use all the instruments from that on the PlayStation 3 version, because

29:36.760 --> 29:37.760
they are identical.

29:37.760 --> 29:42.320
Yeah, but then you have to buy a PlayStation 3, and I don't know if everybody wants to

29:42.320 --> 29:43.320
do that.

29:43.320 --> 29:44.320
Good point.

29:44.320 --> 29:45.320
Alright.

29:45.320 --> 29:50.560
Well, anyhow, moving on to other PlayStation 3 games, including one that I know a lot of

29:50.560 --> 29:55.440
people are excited about, Metal Gear Solid 4 could be the game that definitely drives

29:55.440 --> 30:01.040
sales of the PlayStation 3, and another little perk included in the game to further make

30:01.040 --> 30:02.160
people want to buy this.

30:02.160 --> 30:06.240
Remember an earlier story, which I think was blown out of proportion, but nevertheless

30:06.240 --> 30:10.600
it was reported on previously that Metal Gear Solid was supposed to move a million units

30:10.600 --> 30:13.120
in its first day in order to recover the cost or whatever?

30:13.120 --> 30:14.400
It would need to, yeah.

30:14.400 --> 30:15.400
Yeah.

30:15.400 --> 30:17.800
Well, this could do it, because this is another inclusion that's pretty awesome, and this

30:17.800 --> 30:21.160
came from PlayStation, the official magazine, and their latest issue.

30:21.160 --> 30:27.560
They have confirmed that Metal Gear Online is going to be included, or at least, sorry,

30:27.560 --> 30:31.520
there's going to be like a demo version of it, or some type of limited version of Metal

30:31.520 --> 30:36.560
Gear Online included with Metal Gear Solid 4, Guns of the Patriots.

30:36.560 --> 30:41.160
Actually, no, I take that back, it was originally going to be two separate games, and now it

30:41.160 --> 30:45.000
looks like actually they are going to be coming together with one game.

30:45.000 --> 30:49.600
And Metal Gear Online will have 16 player support, Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, King

30:49.600 --> 30:53.440
of the Hill, Team Sneak, could this be PlayStation 3's version of Halo 3?

30:53.440 --> 30:54.440
Who knows?

30:54.440 --> 30:55.440
Well, certainly not.

30:55.440 --> 30:56.440
No.

30:56.440 --> 30:57.960
Well, they're different types of games, of course, and you could say Unreal Tournament

30:57.960 --> 31:00.600
is kind of their Halo, but, you know, kind of neat.

31:00.600 --> 31:05.040
I don't know, though, that's just like saying Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops was its own

31:05.040 --> 31:07.560
game, and then the online portion was another game.

31:07.560 --> 31:12.040
It's still the same damn game, and the college is Metal Gear Online, so Metal Gear 4, the

31:12.040 --> 31:15.020
online portion of it, I think it's stupid.

31:15.020 --> 31:17.160
It's kind of deceiving the buyer.

31:17.160 --> 31:21.560
I think here's where it comes from, why is this just a demo or is this a full game, is

31:21.560 --> 31:27.280
because they are saying in the magazine, quote, expecting five maps in the starter pack that

31:27.280 --> 31:31.520
will provide the basic setup to get your Metal Gear Solid multiplayer fix moving.

31:31.520 --> 31:36.680
So is starter pack a fancy term for demo, or is starter pack something like a luminous

31:36.680 --> 31:40.580
starter pack that you get on Xbox 360 Arcade, and then you have to buy all these freaking

31:40.580 --> 31:42.920
add-ons to get more stuff for it?

31:42.920 --> 31:43.920
Like the mad-ons.

31:43.920 --> 31:44.920
Who knows?

31:44.920 --> 31:45.920
That's true.

31:45.920 --> 31:50.040
This is a little off topic, but it is talking about Konami, though.

31:50.040 --> 31:51.040
All right, sure, why not?

31:51.040 --> 31:55.200
I don't know if you noticed the first download pack for DDR Universe 2's up.

31:55.200 --> 31:59.800
Yeah, I did actually notice that the other day, because I was poking around the marketplace,

31:59.800 --> 32:02.840
because I myself was downloading the Burnout Paradise demo, I just haven't gotten a chance

32:02.840 --> 32:04.640
to play it yet, and I did notice that.

32:04.640 --> 32:07.520
I saw there were downloads for Universe 2.

32:07.520 --> 32:08.960
Nothing I'm really excited about, though.

32:08.960 --> 32:13.400
Well, because all the songs, from what I understand, are just crossing over from the Xbox series.

32:13.400 --> 32:14.400
The original Xbox series.

32:14.400 --> 32:17.400
I thought there was one I didn't recognize, but that's it.

32:17.400 --> 32:21.360
Luckily, I can buy them separately, so I don't have to buy all the crappy ones.

32:21.360 --> 32:23.880
But you get a discount if you buy all the crap together.

32:23.880 --> 32:25.480
Nope, sorry.

32:25.480 --> 32:27.800
I like how they try to trick you to do that kind of stuff.

32:27.800 --> 32:32.000
Hey, if you buy ten bags of potatoes, you get them for a buck.

32:32.000 --> 32:37.760
You know, ten for a dollar, really, there are ten for ten dollars.

32:37.760 --> 32:39.520
Jamie, Loki's talking about potatoes.

32:39.520 --> 32:41.120
Please save us.

32:41.120 --> 32:45.840
How about some ass hattery from Sony?

32:45.840 --> 32:46.840
Alright.

32:46.840 --> 32:55.640
Well, the Sony CEO, Howard Stringer, is full of crap, because he's quoted as saying,

32:55.640 --> 33:00.840
I'm happy the Wii seems to be running a bit short of hardware.

33:00.840 --> 33:06.120
The PlayStation 3 will come into its own because its games are infinitely more fun, demanding,

33:06.120 --> 33:07.120
and exciting.

33:07.120 --> 33:09.400
Yeah, that's bullshit.

33:09.400 --> 33:12.120
Wait, the Wii is short on hardware?

33:12.120 --> 33:17.680
I mean, there's a variety of third-party things out there for the Wii.

33:17.680 --> 33:19.640
Granted, most of them are shit.

33:19.640 --> 33:22.760
Like I think about that little plastic golf club and stuff that you can get, the little

33:22.760 --> 33:23.760
fake tennis racket.

33:23.760 --> 33:25.600
But, you know, there's the Wii Zapper and stuff.

33:25.600 --> 33:28.680
I mean, they're meaning the Wii itself.

33:28.680 --> 33:31.960
So they're just saying, like, the Wii just isn't as fun as the PlayStation 3?

33:31.960 --> 33:32.960
Pretty much.

33:32.960 --> 33:33.960
I dispute that claim.

33:33.960 --> 33:37.420
I've had a lot more fun playing games on Wii than on PS3.

33:37.420 --> 33:38.480
The Wii is a lot of fun.

33:38.480 --> 33:44.440
I mean, granted, you know, it's not that the PlayStation 3 is horrible, but right now it's

33:44.440 --> 33:45.440
kind of close.

33:45.440 --> 33:50.480
Well, they're thinking that they're going to sell more PlayStation 3s, but honestly,

33:50.480 --> 33:54.960
we saw the stack at Best Buy, you know, and it's not just at that one.

33:54.960 --> 33:59.400
It's at a multitude of stores that they're not moving the units.

33:59.400 --> 34:00.600
People want a Wii.

34:00.600 --> 34:05.580
He does understand that the reason there are no Wiis is because people want them so bad,

34:05.580 --> 34:10.080
and so they keep selling out, whereas the PlayStation 3 doesn't have that problem because

34:10.080 --> 34:12.040
they're not selling out.

34:12.040 --> 34:17.840
I mean, I don't understand, and where does he get off saying, you know, that their games

34:17.840 --> 34:19.500
are more fun?

34:19.500 --> 34:22.360
Because if you like first-person shooters and broken games, that's awesome.

34:22.360 --> 34:25.580
I see the PlayStation 3 has a lot of potential.

34:25.580 --> 34:26.580
It does have potential.

34:26.580 --> 34:27.840
It just hasn't done anything.

34:27.840 --> 34:30.000
I watched that trailer for Final Fantasy 13.

34:30.000 --> 34:32.440
There's a new one that came out this week and it looks fucking amazing.

34:32.440 --> 34:34.000
It looks absolutely fucking amazing.

34:34.000 --> 34:38.080
It's fucking amazing when it comes out Christmas 2009, but I'm not going to wait that long

34:38.080 --> 34:39.080
for that shit.

34:39.080 --> 34:46.360
And I am so all over a PlayStation 3 like, I don't know, like candy, like a fat kid on

34:46.360 --> 34:52.640
candy, but that trailer is amazing, but for right now, there's not a lot that's making

34:52.640 --> 34:54.360
me want to get a PlayStation 3.

34:54.360 --> 34:56.840
If they had that at launch, we wouldn't be talking about that.

34:56.840 --> 34:58.680
We'd be like saying, wow, look at the PlayStation 3.

34:58.680 --> 35:02.800
It's selling millions and millions of units, and Final Fantasy 13 is fucking awesome.

35:02.800 --> 35:04.400
I can play this all day long.

35:04.400 --> 35:08.640
But no, it's just, the problem is it's not going to come out for a long time and we got

35:08.640 --> 35:13.160
more stories talking about some of the other things that were promised to be out earlier,

35:13.160 --> 35:17.520
you know, in 2008, but are probably not.

35:17.520 --> 35:23.780
So well, just to illustrate a point, Dan says that he gets about maybe 50 calls a day for

35:23.780 --> 35:28.880
people asking for a Wii, and I don't think he's mentioned anyone calling it at all for

35:28.880 --> 35:29.880
a PS3.

35:29.880 --> 35:34.200
RustyLUT in chat makes a good point, the Wii is selling on fat appeal.

35:34.200 --> 35:38.160
Look for the shitty software sales for even the good games, right, Zack and Wiki?

35:38.160 --> 35:43.320
Although granted, when you consider the Wii, now my thing is, the Wii is selling to families,

35:43.320 --> 35:48.240
and so games like Zack and Wiki that might be good games for people who follow the gaming

35:48.240 --> 35:52.800
scene and read game reviews, that doesn't quite catch mom's eye, but you know, games

35:52.800 --> 35:56.700
based on movies and all that stuff, and Mario, like Super Mario Galaxy, that kind of shit

35:56.700 --> 35:57.700
catches mom's eye.

35:57.700 --> 36:01.560
And when Wii Fit comes out over here, it's going to start all over again.

36:01.560 --> 36:06.920
I think he kind of has a point, the Wii does make a lot of its sales on fat appeal, but

36:06.920 --> 36:11.760
I mean, that's money for Nintendo, and when this whole Wii Fit thing comes out, I'm going

36:11.760 --> 36:15.740
to tell you, it's going to happen all over again, it's going to continue this fad craze

36:15.740 --> 36:21.360
of the Wii until 2008, and I just hope it's a good game, and fun, and useful.

36:21.360 --> 36:24.440
Who cares how they're selling systems, at least they're selling systems, you can't even

36:24.440 --> 36:29.840
fucking pick a damn approach to how they're selling your systems, oh it's a PC, oh it's

36:29.840 --> 36:34.500
a Blu-ray player, oh it's a game system, you can't fucking make your mind up.

36:34.500 --> 36:37.320
So whatever, at least it's selling.

36:37.320 --> 36:39.720
Alright, let's move on.

36:39.720 --> 36:43.040
If we want to pay attention to these analysts and say, oh yeah, the PS3 is going to take

36:43.040 --> 36:47.440
over in 2011, oh good for them, by that time the next system will be coming out.

36:47.440 --> 36:53.400
Anyways, so the PSP got some pretty cool improvements with the new Japanese firmware, one of which

36:53.400 --> 36:58.640
we're never going to see over here, but that's fine, it's a new DVR, but that's for their

36:58.640 --> 37:02.000
TV service that they have, because they have the TV card.

37:02.000 --> 37:05.720
The other thing though, which I hope we see over here, and hopefully we'll be able to

37:05.720 --> 37:09.080
utilize, is internet radio.

37:09.080 --> 37:13.800
You'll actually be able to tune in different channels, I think it's over Shoutcast actually,

37:13.800 --> 37:17.720
yeah it is powered by Shoutcast, so that's kind of cool that they have that kind of support,

37:17.720 --> 37:23.440
I know for a while there they had the Homebrew PSP radio that you could use and it looks

37:23.440 --> 37:28.200
kind of similar, so, you know, we need to broadcast on Shoutcast.

37:28.200 --> 37:32.160
I was going to say, OLRPSP.com I think needs an update badly, especially if that ends up

37:32.160 --> 37:33.160
coming out over here.

37:33.160 --> 37:34.160
We need people to be able to listen to OLR.

37:34.160 --> 37:36.080
Well, we don't broadcast over Shoutcast though.

37:36.080 --> 37:40.240
Well sort of, I think you can tap the live 365 feed into Shoutcast somehow.

37:40.240 --> 37:41.240
No.

37:41.240 --> 37:42.240
Can't you?

37:42.240 --> 37:43.240
No.

37:43.240 --> 37:44.240
Damn it!

37:44.240 --> 37:45.240
I don't know how, at least.

37:45.240 --> 37:46.240
Interesting.

37:46.240 --> 37:47.240
If you could, that'd be awesome.

37:47.240 --> 37:50.120
I'm going to have to do that, because I know we get emails once in a while from people,

37:50.120 --> 37:51.120
right?

37:51.120 --> 37:52.840
That say we listen on PSP, we listen on PSP.

37:52.840 --> 37:56.200
If that stuff comes out over here, heck, even if it doesn't come out over here, I bet there's

37:56.200 --> 38:00.520
got to be at least a handful of people that listen on their PSPs to this program in Japan.

38:00.520 --> 38:03.200
We ought to be able to let them listen live on their PSPs.

38:03.200 --> 38:04.200
Why not?

38:04.200 --> 38:05.200
Why not?

38:05.200 --> 38:07.120
Get on that, Loki!

38:07.120 --> 38:08.120
Make it happen!

38:08.120 --> 38:10.760
Oh, well let me just figure out how to broadcast on Shoutcast, that'd be awesome.

38:10.760 --> 38:12.600
Hey, you do that homework assignment.

38:12.600 --> 38:15.000
I've already tried doing that stuff.

38:15.000 --> 38:16.080
I can't figure it out.

38:16.080 --> 38:17.480
I'm too stupid.

38:17.480 --> 38:18.960
Sorry to hear that.

38:18.960 --> 38:20.280
Let's get to some release dates.

38:20.280 --> 38:23.680
Speaking of our friends over in Japan, I've got the Japanese release dates for you coming

38:23.680 --> 38:26.000
on the Xbox 360, December 20th.

38:26.000 --> 38:29.640
FIFA 08 World Class Soccer comes out in Japan.

38:29.640 --> 38:32.920
Moving on with the release dates, we also have a release of FIFA 08 on the PlayStation

38:32.920 --> 38:34.000
3.

38:34.000 --> 38:37.600
The GunCon makes its way to the PlayStation 3 separately, I assume.

38:37.600 --> 38:40.960
Oh no, Time Crisis finally comes out in Japan as well.

38:40.960 --> 38:43.100
It's a little later down my list here.

38:43.100 --> 38:47.160
So Time Crisis 4 makes its way to the PlayStation 3 in Japan this week, also on the 20th.

38:47.160 --> 38:52.240
Medal of Honor Airborne also makes its way from EA to the PlayStation 3 in Japan this

38:52.240 --> 38:53.280
week.

38:53.280 --> 38:56.440
Coming out on the Nintendo Wii, Crazy Climber Wii.

38:56.440 --> 38:59.360
Remember we reported on this earlier a couple months ago.

38:59.360 --> 39:04.440
They were remaking the classic 80s game Crazy Climber for the Wii.

39:04.440 --> 39:06.760
Japan will finally get its first look at that this week.

39:06.760 --> 39:08.360
And maybe we will soon, too.

39:08.360 --> 39:09.360
Who knows?

39:09.360 --> 39:13.840
Mr. Robinson's from Disney makes its way to the Japanese market December 20th with their

39:13.840 --> 39:15.140
own game on the Wii.

39:15.140 --> 39:17.080
Another port of FIFA 08 as well.

39:17.080 --> 39:24.360
And SpongeBob SquarePants, Attack of the ToyBots, comes out as well from THQ on December 20th.

39:24.360 --> 39:27.680
Cats with a Z2 and Dogs with a Z2.

39:27.680 --> 39:31.480
If you thought this was the only country that got those shitty games with Zs on the end

39:31.480 --> 39:32.960
They're not bad, actually.

39:32.960 --> 39:34.300
Nintendo Wii, really?

39:34.300 --> 39:35.480
They're not that bad.

39:35.480 --> 39:36.480
Really?

39:36.480 --> 39:37.480
Cats, too.

39:37.480 --> 39:38.480
I want to hear about this.

39:38.480 --> 39:39.480
I want to hear about this.

39:39.480 --> 39:44.000
They're not awesome, but they're not horrible.

39:44.000 --> 39:46.040
Cats 2 actually got a pretty decent review.

39:46.040 --> 39:50.960
It's funny because they even have that stupid frog cat that you see on Caturday and stuff

39:50.960 --> 39:51.960
like that.

39:51.960 --> 39:52.960
They have that kind of stuff.

39:52.960 --> 39:56.000
You literally can dress up your animals like that.

39:56.000 --> 39:57.960
But then your cat will hate you.

39:57.960 --> 39:59.360
Dark Deceus is right there.

39:59.360 --> 40:01.720
Cats 2 equals frog cat.

40:01.720 --> 40:05.560
It seriously does have the frog cat on there.

40:05.560 --> 40:10.960
So it's stupid, but hey, over here, at least in the United States, it's only like 30 bucks.

40:10.960 --> 40:14.520
So wait, find one to use for like 10 bucks or something like that.

40:14.520 --> 40:15.520
There you go.

40:15.520 --> 40:18.720
Or if you feel like paying twice as much, you could import the one from Japan.

40:18.720 --> 40:21.400
I'd rather not because it's already out over here.

40:21.400 --> 40:24.820
There's no point importing.

40:24.820 --> 40:29.920
Moving on with other release dates, the PlayStation 2 is getting some releases as well.

40:29.920 --> 40:32.720
Myself Yourself is a game that's coming out.

40:32.720 --> 40:36.000
There's a limited edition of it as well on the 20th.

40:36.000 --> 40:39.480
Another game called Pia Carrot y Yokoso, G.O.

40:39.480 --> 40:40.560
Summer Fair.

40:40.560 --> 40:41.560
Also has a limited edition.

40:41.560 --> 40:43.760
Pia Carrot's old school too.

40:43.760 --> 40:45.720
That's an old school anime, right?

40:45.720 --> 40:48.080
The games have been out for quite a while.

40:48.080 --> 40:53.240
Well, I guess it's another one coming out December 20th, just in time for Christmas

40:53.240 --> 40:55.860
over in Japan.

40:55.860 --> 41:00.280
Looking at a couple other games, I want to see if there's anything on the DS or PSP because

41:00.280 --> 41:03.000
of course those are always crazy.

41:03.000 --> 41:05.040
Port of Meet the Robinsons on the DS.

41:05.040 --> 41:07.880
Doko Demo Pilates comes out.

41:07.880 --> 41:08.880
That's not pirates.

41:08.880 --> 41:11.600
That's Pilates comes out in Japan as well.

41:11.600 --> 41:12.600
Dora Base.

41:12.600 --> 41:17.480
Doraemon Chow Yaku Gaiden comes out from Namco on the Nintendo DS.

41:17.480 --> 41:20.000
A puzzler called DS Puzzler.

41:20.000 --> 41:24.760
Numpla DS Puzzler comes out as well on the Nintendo DS.

41:24.760 --> 41:26.560
And I'm sure a lot of people are very excited about this.

41:26.560 --> 41:28.960
This is one that folks might even be importing.

41:28.960 --> 41:33.560
Final Fantasy IV, the remake, hits Japan this week on the Nintendo DS.

41:33.560 --> 41:37.200
I'm sure that's going to be the best selling game of the week as far as the new stuffs

41:37.200 --> 41:38.200
go.

41:38.200 --> 41:39.680
I like the sound of this game though.

41:39.680 --> 41:42.080
Pinky Street Kira Kira Music Night.

41:42.080 --> 41:43.080
Ah, fun!

41:43.080 --> 41:45.280
I actually have Pinky Street dolls.

41:45.280 --> 41:46.880
Really?

41:46.880 --> 41:51.080
What they are, they're these little plastic dolls and they're maybe about, I would want

41:51.080 --> 41:53.320
to say like three inches tall.

41:53.320 --> 41:54.320
They're smurf sized.

41:54.320 --> 42:01.000
But anyway, no that's three apples high.

42:01.000 --> 42:03.880
You can take off their heads and change them out and take off their hair and change them

42:03.880 --> 42:09.560
out and it's like you snap them into place is how they work.

42:09.560 --> 42:14.200
And so they're fully customizable and I guess it would be the same type of thing on the

42:14.200 --> 42:19.200
game as you customize your Pinky and I've got like a few of them by now.

42:19.200 --> 42:25.040
They even did Street Fighter and King of Fighters themed ones in Sakura Taisen.

42:25.040 --> 42:26.760
So I've got a few of those.

42:26.760 --> 42:28.280
Oh, very interesting.

42:28.280 --> 42:30.280
Is there any interest in getting this game?

42:30.280 --> 42:31.280
Importing it maybe?

42:31.280 --> 42:32.280
No.

42:32.280 --> 42:33.280
Alright.

42:33.280 --> 42:34.280
After all that.

42:34.280 --> 42:35.280
Alright, that's it for Japanese release.

42:35.280 --> 42:37.160
That's all I'm going to cover on Japanese release dates.

42:37.160 --> 42:38.160
Let's move on.

42:38.160 --> 42:42.060
So is that like, you know, build a human type thing?

42:42.060 --> 42:43.060
Not really.

42:43.060 --> 42:44.060
I'll find a link for the chat room.

42:44.060 --> 42:45.060
I have no idea.

42:45.060 --> 42:46.960
Let's go over to Europe.

42:46.960 --> 42:48.720
Only one game is on the list.

42:48.720 --> 42:49.720
Yeah.

42:49.720 --> 42:51.880
On the 19th Sensible World of Soccer.

42:51.880 --> 42:55.960
Oh, coming out finally to the Xbox 360 Live Arcade.

42:55.960 --> 42:56.960
That is it.

42:56.960 --> 42:59.920
So I guess it's slowing down because it's Christmas time.

42:59.920 --> 43:00.920
I guess so.

43:00.920 --> 43:01.920
How about the US?

43:01.920 --> 43:05.160
The US has got a few things, not as much as usual.

43:05.160 --> 43:07.320
Anyways, a few things.

43:07.320 --> 43:16.760
MX vs ATV Untamed coming out on PSP, Playstation 2, Xbox 360, and Playstation 3 and DS.

43:16.760 --> 43:20.800
Elements of Destruction is coming out on DS and that game is kind of neat looking.

43:20.800 --> 43:27.240
It's basically, you kind of play mother nature so you can cause tornadoes and fires and stuff.

43:27.240 --> 43:33.400
It is also coming to Xbox Live Arcade at some point, so that's kind of neat.

43:33.400 --> 43:38.240
And then let's see here, Warhammer 40,000 Squad Command on the DS.

43:38.240 --> 43:44.800
Dyson Ryaku Exceed coming to the Playstation 2.

43:44.800 --> 43:52.040
And let's see here, also the Playstation 2 of Rock Band, that game is coming out this

43:52.040 --> 43:53.680
week as well.

43:53.680 --> 43:59.200
So let's see here, Atari Classics Evolved for the PSP, another one of those compilation

43:59.200 --> 44:00.200
sets.

44:00.200 --> 44:03.720
Luxor 2 on the DS.

44:03.720 --> 44:10.840
And Night's Journey of Dreams on the Wii, so you can get your night's fix here pretty

44:10.840 --> 44:11.840
soon.

44:11.840 --> 44:12.840
Jamie's applauding over there.

44:12.840 --> 44:14.920
I'm getting my night's fix already.

44:14.920 --> 44:17.640
Did you ask Santa for that for Christmas?

44:17.640 --> 44:22.280
I'm probably going to get it, but we've been playing Christmas night.

44:22.280 --> 44:27.440
And then one other thing I was going to mention here real quick, it's not a game but I thought

44:27.440 --> 44:29.040
it's interesting anyways.

44:29.040 --> 44:32.600
Mad Catz is putting out an HDMI conversion kit.

44:32.600 --> 44:37.880
It actually, it's for all those people like me that do not have an Xbox 360 with HDMI

44:37.880 --> 44:38.880
out.

44:38.880 --> 44:46.360
It plugs into the back of your system and allows you to do HDMI and optical out as well.

44:46.360 --> 44:54.960
Although the only sting to it is that it retails for $89.99.

44:54.960 --> 44:59.600
Nintendo announced this week, obviously they're having some issues staying on top of manufacturing

44:59.600 --> 45:04.040
enough Wiis for everybody out there, so this is their contingency plan they announced this

45:04.040 --> 45:05.480
week.

45:05.480 --> 45:10.240
Reggie Fils-Aime came out this week and said, hey, we're joining up with GameStop.

45:10.240 --> 45:13.600
We're going to create this Wii rain check program.

45:13.600 --> 45:18.580
Basically what happens is that if you pay GameStop $250, then you get a rain check that

45:18.580 --> 45:24.520
promises you a Wii by January 29th, I believe was the day, the end of next month.

45:24.520 --> 45:30.360
So this is for all those people who are having issues trying to get the Nintendo Wii at the

45:30.360 --> 45:31.600
store or what have you.

45:31.600 --> 45:34.840
And the reason why Nintendo wanted to partner up with GameStop is because GameStop really

45:34.840 --> 45:40.720
already has it in their system to be able to take these type of deposits for games.

45:40.720 --> 45:42.880
That's at least the reason why they did it.

45:42.880 --> 45:48.460
The only days, however, that you can do this, December 20th and 21st are the only days that

45:48.460 --> 45:49.840
you are going to be able to do this.

45:49.840 --> 45:54.680
However, there are supposed to be tens of thousands of rain checks available and who

45:54.680 --> 45:59.900
knows, that may still not be enough for the demand of the console because it's the Furby

45:59.900 --> 46:01.220
of 2007.

46:01.220 --> 46:03.340
It's the Cabbage Patch Kid.

46:03.340 --> 46:05.320
That's the gift of this year.

46:05.320 --> 46:07.200
I waited in line.

46:07.200 --> 46:08.200
For a Wii?

46:08.200 --> 46:09.200
For my Wii.

46:09.200 --> 46:10.200
I know.

46:10.200 --> 46:12.080
I made my roommate wait in line for mine and it worked.

46:12.080 --> 46:13.080
Did very well.

46:13.080 --> 46:18.840
See, it just goes to show that sometimes waiting in line for these things actually does pay

46:18.840 --> 46:19.840
off.

46:19.840 --> 46:20.840
Right.

46:20.840 --> 46:23.240
But at the same time, how would you feel if you were one of those kids?

46:23.240 --> 46:24.240
Let's flashback.

46:24.240 --> 46:27.760
I told the story earlier in the show about me as the spoiled brat when I was a kid.

46:27.760 --> 46:32.120
Let's flashback to me as the spoiled brat as a kid who wanted a Nintendo Wii this Christmas.

46:32.120 --> 46:34.680
Now I open up my present to get one of these rain checks.

46:34.680 --> 46:39.520
Am I going to be a satisfied kid or am I going to cry?

46:39.520 --> 46:42.280
You're a bad parent if you give your kid a rain check.

46:42.280 --> 46:43.280
Really?

46:43.280 --> 46:44.280
Yeah, I think so.

46:44.280 --> 46:45.280
I think it's an okay alternative.

46:45.280 --> 46:49.240
I mean, the kids aren't going to understand at first, but at the same time, they're going

46:49.240 --> 46:50.240
to get a Wii.

46:50.240 --> 46:53.880
You don't need to wrap up a rain check because they don't fucking understand that.

46:53.880 --> 46:58.200
You just say, listen, we couldn't get you one right now, but we will get you one by

46:58.200 --> 46:59.200
the end of January.

46:59.200 --> 47:01.640
You don't have to say, here's a fucking rain check for you.

47:01.640 --> 47:04.680
I mean, that's just like, kids are like, what?

47:04.680 --> 47:06.360
I don't understand this.

47:06.360 --> 47:07.360
I'm not getting a Wii.

47:07.360 --> 47:08.360
Where's the controller?

47:08.360 --> 47:09.360
Where's Mario?

47:09.360 --> 47:10.360
Santa hates me.

47:10.360 --> 47:17.160
He's going to go take the rain check and soak it with his tears is what he's going to do.

47:17.160 --> 47:22.920
Well you know what, in my family when I was a kid, if there was something that I wanted

47:22.920 --> 47:27.960
and didn't get, I lived with it.

47:27.960 --> 47:32.920
Or you get a job mowing lawns or selling lemonade and you save up and you buy the fucking thing

47:32.920 --> 47:33.920
yourself.

47:33.920 --> 47:35.420
Or I stole it from my brother.

47:35.420 --> 47:37.520
That's exactly what you do.

47:37.520 --> 47:42.640
The year you wanted your Super Nintendo and everything, my brothers went into Super Nintendo.

47:42.640 --> 47:45.800
And my mom asked me, should I get them a Super Nintendo or a Genesis?

47:45.800 --> 47:49.140
You need to get them a Super Nintendo and you need to get these games.

47:49.140 --> 47:52.460
She got them a Super Scope, Zelda.

47:52.460 --> 47:54.840
She picked out Home Alone for some retarded reason.

47:54.840 --> 47:56.200
That game sucked ass.

47:56.200 --> 47:58.200
Home Alone?

47:58.200 --> 48:01.960
Kevin McCallister's so cute.

48:01.960 --> 48:05.480
And so my brothers played like five seconds of Home Alone.

48:05.480 --> 48:08.800
And I beat Zelda that week.

48:08.800 --> 48:11.720
Did your brothers even play the Super Nintendo or was this your present?

48:11.720 --> 48:14.240
They played Home Alone and they're like, what did I do bad?

48:14.240 --> 48:15.240
Seriously?

48:15.240 --> 48:16.600
Why am I being punished?

48:16.600 --> 48:25.040
No, they actually, my brothers and I played a lot of Blastress and the mole thing.

48:25.040 --> 48:29.120
I'm going to get Jamie a copy of Home Alone on the Super Nintendo for Christmas and wrap

48:29.120 --> 48:34.160
it in coal and put it in her stocking.

48:34.160 --> 48:35.960
That'd be great.

48:35.960 --> 48:40.120
My little brothers were too busy running around being little terrorists in the neighborhood

48:40.120 --> 48:41.760
so I had the Super Nintendo.

48:41.760 --> 48:43.560
Comments from chat, love it.

48:43.560 --> 48:48.840
SSJ100Matt says, dear little Billy, I owe you a wee, love Santa.

48:48.840 --> 48:51.400
Tiger Claw, what if you lose the rain check?

48:51.400 --> 48:53.120
Wouldn't you be screwed?

48:53.120 --> 48:57.480
I don't know if you would be because GameStop sucks because they'd be like, oh, you don't

48:57.480 --> 48:58.480
have your receipt.

48:58.480 --> 49:00.760
Sorry, Billy, you ain't ever getting away.

49:00.760 --> 49:04.920
I seem to recall I didn't have my receipt once for a $5 pre-order and they still gave

49:04.920 --> 49:07.580
it to me because it was in the phone number.

49:07.580 --> 49:16.200
Not only that, they actually keep a copy of your receipt in the store, a physical copy,

49:16.200 --> 49:17.200
and they file them.

49:17.200 --> 49:18.220
Yeah, see, I've done that before.

49:18.220 --> 49:19.720
They lost my receipt in the store.

49:19.720 --> 49:23.240
I had my receipt still and they gave it to them and showed them and stuff and they're

49:23.240 --> 49:32.280
like, well, we can't find your receipt here, so I don't know what to do.

49:32.280 --> 49:36.360
My mommy wrote me a note from Santa that said the elves couldn't find a copy of Hey You

49:36.360 --> 49:55.280
Pikachu because the store was sold out and I would get it eventually.

49:55.280 --> 50:06.480
Well, seriously, this is why I love the concept of gift cards, especially for me being picky

50:06.480 --> 50:07.480
as a kid.

50:07.480 --> 50:09.360
Again, if I got something I didn't want, I always took it back to the store myself, returned

50:09.360 --> 50:11.800
it myself, and got what I wanted.

50:11.800 --> 50:14.560
Actually, I was just thinking something there.

50:14.560 --> 50:19.600
Nintendo's quite smart teaming up with GameStop with this whole rain check thing because if

50:19.600 --> 50:24.360
for whatever reason Nintendo can't deliver those Wiiis by the end of January, people

50:24.360 --> 50:28.200
are going to be fucking pissed off at GameStop, but no one's going to remember that it's Nintendo's

50:28.200 --> 50:29.200
fault.

50:29.200 --> 50:32.440
I want to hear more about 10-year-old Jamie marching into the store and returning your

50:32.440 --> 50:33.440
gifts.

50:33.440 --> 50:44.640
Well, it's like my family would buy me ugly clothes, so I would make them drop me off

50:44.640 --> 50:49.440
at the mall and then I'd go do all my exchanges myself and sometimes I'd get cash back and

50:49.440 --> 50:57.320
then go over to Babbage's because we had Babbage's before GameStop took them all over.

50:57.320 --> 50:59.440
You know I'm not going to wear this.

50:59.440 --> 51:02.920
I'm taking it back to get games instead.

51:02.920 --> 51:06.720
Oh my god, shoes.

51:06.720 --> 51:12.400
Or if they wouldn't, I would just get a different pair of jeans or something.

51:12.400 --> 51:18.280
It wasn't that I was ungrateful or anything.

51:18.280 --> 51:20.640
Or a sick bastard, as GS68 put it.

51:20.640 --> 51:24.960
No, it wasn't that I was ungrateful or anything because I was plenty grateful for the stuff

51:24.960 --> 51:31.880
that I got because when I was growing up, we didn't actually have a whole lot of money.

51:31.880 --> 51:36.680
When I was in first and second grade, we were actually poverty level.

51:36.680 --> 51:44.520
I remember having icicles in my bathtub one winter and I'm not even joking.

51:44.520 --> 51:54.080
Now I think I'm really spoiled, but when I was a kid, if I got something, then if it

51:54.080 --> 51:58.920
wasn't what I wanted, I found a way to turn it into what I wanted, so it was just a matter

51:58.920 --> 51:59.920
of that.

51:59.920 --> 52:06.400
All these kids who say, oh, but I want a Wii, well, tough shit.

52:06.400 --> 52:08.160
There are no Wiis.

52:08.160 --> 52:09.160
Get something else.

52:09.160 --> 52:10.160
You'll live.

52:10.160 --> 52:16.240
Get a job, Billy, Sam, I didn't buy you a Wii because you don't have a job.

52:16.240 --> 52:26.720
No, but you see, I think that there's just way too much of, oh, well, you know, and Dan

52:26.720 --> 52:30.200
is actually saying, and I'm not going to go into any detail on this, this person is saying,

52:30.200 --> 52:33.200
oh, I spent all this money in your store and I'm entitled to a Wii.

52:33.200 --> 52:34.640
Well, we don't have any.

52:34.640 --> 52:36.760
Tough shit.

52:36.760 --> 52:42.560
I think that people need to learn to be, I guess, to take no for an answer and find something

52:42.560 --> 52:43.560
else.

52:43.560 --> 52:46.940
You know, I can just imagine if Jamie had a kid, or maybe I would do this to my kid

52:46.940 --> 52:50.540
and I wasn't able to get a Wii for my kid, I would leave a no under the tree for something

52:50.540 --> 52:51.540
like this.

52:51.540 --> 52:52.540
This isn't like this.

52:52.540 --> 52:55.720
Santa is very sorry that he could not get you a Wii this year.

52:55.720 --> 53:00.840
He has more important things to do, like ending genocide in Darfur, right?

53:00.840 --> 53:02.440
He doesn't do any of that kind of crap.

53:02.440 --> 53:03.440
He just delivers.

53:03.440 --> 53:06.280
He's a fucking glorified UPS driver is what he is.

53:06.280 --> 53:11.720
No, but seriously, though, all these people that think they need special treatment stuff

53:11.720 --> 53:16.400
or finding Wiis and stuff like that, I get customers asking, you know, yeah, I have someone

53:16.400 --> 53:17.400
looking for a Wii.

53:17.400 --> 53:20.320
I'm like, you know, it's like two weeks before Christmas, why the fuck are they just now

53:20.320 --> 53:21.320
looking for a Wii?

53:21.320 --> 53:22.600
Why didn't they plan this out?

53:22.600 --> 53:25.000
Oh, well, they didn't know it was going to be so hard to find.

53:25.000 --> 53:27.320
Well, tough shit for them.

53:27.320 --> 53:30.120
Why should we cater to the fact that they're stupid?

53:30.120 --> 53:31.120
All right.

53:31.120 --> 53:33.600
I'm sure we've got lots of holiday stories.

53:33.600 --> 53:35.960
Maybe we'll get some of them in our mailbag later from our listeners.

53:35.960 --> 53:40.320
I'm not trying to be, you know, all kinds of, you know, rawr on it.

53:40.320 --> 53:46.720
It's just I get kind of irritated with people expecting too much, you know, thinking they're

53:46.720 --> 53:54.040
entitled to something when really what you're entitled to is a roof and food.

53:54.040 --> 53:59.360
Xenocore in chat says, the toughest retail store in the US, Jamie's Gaming Outlet.

53:59.360 --> 54:00.360
You'll get it when it's here.

54:00.360 --> 54:01.360
Now, get out of my store.

54:01.360 --> 54:04.360
Dude, I would do that, too.

54:04.360 --> 54:07.480
All right, let's move on with more news, Jamie.

54:07.480 --> 54:09.440
What's the latest news at Jamie's Gaming Outlet?

54:09.440 --> 54:11.920
Hey, virtual console stuff.

54:11.920 --> 54:20.040
For our friends in the UK, we have Pokemon Snap that was on the Nintendo 64 and, you

54:20.040 --> 54:23.360
know, Pokemon Snap is great and it's fun and lovely.

54:23.360 --> 54:27.320
And then we have Top Hunter that was on Neo Geo.

54:27.320 --> 54:32.600
Yeah, I didn't really like Top Hunter all that much, so I'm not going to talk about

54:32.600 --> 54:33.600
it.

54:33.600 --> 54:38.960
The last one, which is almost as cool as Pokemon Snap, but cooler in its own respect, is Mega

54:38.960 --> 54:46.020
Man 2 from Nintendo Entertainment System.

54:46.020 --> 54:48.720
And if you don't know what Mega Man 2 is, you need to climb out of that cave you've

54:48.720 --> 54:50.160
been living in for the past 20 years.

54:50.160 --> 54:52.680
Do they have Mega Man 1 on virtual console over there?

54:52.680 --> 54:53.680
I don't know.

54:53.680 --> 54:54.880
Or is Mega Man 2 the first game they're getting?

54:54.880 --> 54:56.560
I think Mega Man 2 is the first.

54:56.560 --> 55:00.160
Dude, I want both and I want Mega Man 3.

55:00.160 --> 55:02.480
The first one was great.

55:02.480 --> 55:03.480
It really was.

55:03.480 --> 55:04.480
Mega Man weapon.

55:04.480 --> 55:08.080
It was different than all the others, but it was great and it had some awesome music.

55:08.080 --> 55:11.440
Some of my favorite music ever from a video game was like a Lekkman stage.

55:11.440 --> 55:17.520
But I really liked the metal blades, though, in Mega Man 2.

55:17.520 --> 55:21.560
But I totally loved Mega Man 3 because you had to beat the game with the top, with like

55:21.560 --> 55:23.040
the most useless weapon.

55:23.040 --> 55:25.600
Ah, RasteelUT has a good point, though.

55:25.600 --> 55:27.720
Yeah, I already have Mega Man Collection.

55:27.720 --> 55:28.980
Good point.

55:28.980 --> 55:32.200
Why not just get the Mega Man Collection and do the backwards compatibility with the GameCube

55:32.200 --> 55:33.200
disc?

55:33.200 --> 55:34.200
Good thought.

55:34.200 --> 55:37.040
F the Virtual Console for Mega Man, huh?

55:37.040 --> 55:38.960
Yeah, F the Virtual Console.

55:38.960 --> 55:41.560
Why should I have to buy games again?

55:41.560 --> 55:46.400
Damn you, Nintendo, and trying to get me to purchase stuff I've already purchased again.

55:46.400 --> 55:47.400
And it works.

55:47.400 --> 55:49.640
Yeah, stupid Game Boy.

55:49.640 --> 55:54.600
Anyways, one thing that we're going to be getting over here pretty soon, Dragon Quest

55:54.600 --> 55:55.600
Swords.

55:55.600 --> 55:59.360
It's been announced to come to the US on February 26th.

55:59.360 --> 56:01.680
It has a really fucking long name.

56:01.680 --> 56:06.320
Dragon Quest Swords, The Masked Queen, and The Tower of Mirrors.

56:06.320 --> 56:08.320
Too long of a subtitle.

56:08.320 --> 56:10.920
But it looks like a pretty fun game.

56:10.920 --> 56:16.640
I have not yet played the Japanese version of it, but you used the Wiimote to slash at

56:16.640 --> 56:19.120
slimes, so that can't be that bad.

56:19.120 --> 56:22.680
Didn't they have that same thing on the PlayStation 2, I seem to recall?

56:22.680 --> 56:26.640
Like, I remember going to some anime convention and in a back room they had a Dragon Quest

56:26.640 --> 56:29.160
game, they had a giant sword, and you'd slash slimes.

56:29.160 --> 56:30.160
I think, yeah.

56:30.160 --> 56:32.760
Well, they had an arcade version of that.

56:32.760 --> 56:36.240
They did have an arcade version, so maybe it's the same thing.

56:36.240 --> 56:37.400
Kind of neat.

56:37.400 --> 56:40.040
Perhaps, but I guess this is taking a while.

56:40.040 --> 56:43.440
Wasn't this supposed to be a launch game and we're just now getting it?

56:43.440 --> 56:44.880
Uh, yeah.

56:44.880 --> 56:47.600
Along with the whole Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles?

56:47.600 --> 56:48.600
What the F square?

56:48.600 --> 56:49.600
Where the hell did your Wii games go?

56:49.600 --> 56:52.440
Uh, Crystal Chronicles, I want to say, was like June now.

56:52.440 --> 56:54.600
Geez, that was supposed to be a launch game.

56:54.600 --> 56:55.600
Am I crazy?

56:55.600 --> 56:56.600
No.

56:56.600 --> 56:57.600
I thought it was.

56:57.600 --> 56:58.600
No, wait.

56:58.600 --> 56:59.600
No, no, I'm sorry, not June.

56:59.600 --> 57:00.600
I'm just kidding.

57:00.600 --> 57:01.600
But it's only the DS version.

57:01.600 --> 57:04.000
They haven't announced the Wii version yet.

57:04.000 --> 57:05.600
Crystal Chronicles was kind of underrated.

57:05.600 --> 57:06.760
I really loved that game.

57:06.760 --> 57:09.960
The only problem with it is that, god, you had to have a lot of shit in order to be able

57:09.960 --> 57:12.480
to play that game, including four people.

57:12.480 --> 57:16.920
Four Game Boy Advances and four Link Kables and everything.

57:16.920 --> 57:17.920
Yeah, everything.

57:17.920 --> 57:21.520
Alright, well, if you want a Wii to be playing the Dragon Quest game on, of course we've

57:21.520 --> 57:25.060
been talking about that they're practically impossible to find, but one thing to keep

57:25.060 --> 57:30.440
in mind is that the Nintendo World Store in New York City and Rockefeller Center, they

57:30.440 --> 57:34.120
get more shipments of the Wii every morning.

57:34.120 --> 57:38.200
Apparently a reporter from Game Daily visited the store recently and observed that there

57:38.200 --> 57:44.000
were 20 Wiis lined up behind the main counter just waiting for whoever's in line, but what's

57:44.000 --> 57:48.920
been going on is that more and more recently, WCBS Radio reported not that long ago that

57:48.920 --> 57:54.600
there were over 200 people camped out outside the store before the store even opened, and

57:54.600 --> 57:59.680
some folks are traveling all the way from Virginia to get a freaking Nintendo Wii.

57:59.680 --> 58:03.160
Oh shit, that's a good way to do it if you know they're going to get some in every day.

58:03.160 --> 58:08.720
Hey, if you don't get it the first day, go see some sites, come back and camp later.

58:08.720 --> 58:09.720
What about your day job?

58:09.720 --> 58:12.160
I don't know, is it just me?

58:12.160 --> 58:15.960
Fuck that, getting a Wii for Billy is more important.

58:15.960 --> 58:17.880
I digress, but never mind.

58:17.880 --> 58:20.680
Let's move on with some more gaming news.

58:20.680 --> 58:31.760
Well, more Wii stuff is the game Castle Shigigami 3 will be coming out to Nintendo Wii next

58:31.760 --> 58:33.320
year.

58:33.320 --> 58:36.560
It has a lot to do with dodging bullets.

58:36.560 --> 58:38.440
It's bullet hell.

58:38.440 --> 58:39.720
Yeah.

58:39.720 --> 58:41.200
Yay!

58:41.200 --> 58:44.320
Good for those fans of Ikaruga and stuff like that, of course I think you can get...

58:44.320 --> 58:48.440
It's a very interesting shooter, and also you collect coins while you play.

58:48.440 --> 58:51.560
I wonder how that's going to control the Wii, I wonder if it's going to be like Geometry

58:51.560 --> 58:54.120
Wars where you point at the screen where you want to shoot, or if it's going to have

58:54.120 --> 58:55.440
that kind of functionality in it.

58:55.440 --> 58:56.440
I don't know, it doesn't...

58:56.440 --> 59:00.440
Uh, I think you're probably thinking way too much into it, they'll probably have this...

59:00.440 --> 59:01.440
No, seriously, seriously.

59:01.440 --> 59:06.000
They'll probably just have the controller turned sideways and playing it like a virtual

59:06.000 --> 59:07.000
console game.

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
Oh, yeah, I guess that'll work too, huh?

59:09.000 --> 59:12.120
Yeah, because I mean, a lot of these games don't use the motion controls and stuff like

59:12.120 --> 59:13.120
that.

59:13.120 --> 59:16.000
It'd be too hard, especially with pinpoint stuff.

59:16.000 --> 59:17.000
Well that works.

59:17.000 --> 59:23.480
Anyways, so, there's another game coming to the Wii, this is kind of interesting actually.

59:23.480 --> 59:27.920
I laughed when I saw it, because even though there's a game that's just like it that's

59:27.920 --> 59:29.980
already been announced, we don't know when that's coming out.

59:29.980 --> 59:34.600
This game though, however, is coming out, I want to say in March.

59:34.600 --> 59:39.920
Anyways, the game is called Wild Earth, African Safari.

59:39.920 --> 59:44.520
Oh great, now the Wii's getting on the Africa craze as well.

59:44.520 --> 59:45.520
Yes.

59:45.520 --> 59:46.520
Wonderful.

59:46.520 --> 59:49.700
Wild Earth, Africa, Safari.

59:49.700 --> 59:53.000
Very similar to Africa, and it's...

59:53.000 --> 59:54.200
How can you say that?

59:54.200 --> 59:56.880
We don't know anything about Africa.

59:56.880 --> 01:00:01.240
They are similar in the regards they are both about Africa.

01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:04.600
Africa is a giant fucking place, I don't know if you are aware.

01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:10.680
Hey, I will have you know that there's photography in this game, much like Africa.

01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:15.120
There are animals just like Africa, they both take place in Africa.

01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:19.320
If anything else, I would say this is more authentic, because they spelled Africa correctly.

01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:21.560
Okay, so, whatever.

01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:27.160
Anyways, Safari Photo Africa Wild Earth is a PC game, I guess it got released a while

01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:32.920
ago and took home some awards in the 2003 Independent Games Festival, including the

01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:39.040
coveted Sumas McNally Grand Prize, whatever the fuck that's supposed to mean.

01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:44.720
Anyways, this game takes place, you are a photojournalist exploring Africa's Serengeti

01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:50.960
National Park, tasked with taking photos of 30 different animals in their natural habitat.

01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:54.880
And apparently if you get close to the animals for the perfect shot, or if you get too close,

01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:59.160
the Wii remote will rumble, making it harder to snap the picture.

01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:05.760
And the Wii version will include co-op multiplayer, one player to drive, while the other two shoot

01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:06.760
photos.

01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:11.600
Unfortunately, we can't run over the animals with the jeep, at least I don't think you

01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:12.600
can.

01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:13.600
Boring.

01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:16.640
The only way I'm going to play any of these games is if I can run over the animals.

01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:17.640
I don't get it.

01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:19.160
Jamie, what the hell's going on here?

01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:24.160
We're getting Africa on the Playstation 3, this Safari game on the Wii, yet still no

01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:26.000
Jumbo Safari.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.440
What the hell is wrong with this world?

01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:32.920
Well, you know, we have no Jumbo Safari, but we also have no Planet Harrier.

01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:34.960
Hi!

01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:40.620
It's all those games that came out around that time, we have, you know, if Sega would

01:01:40.620 --> 01:01:46.400
give us a dedicated platform, a dedicated system, then we would have all this awesome,

01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:47.400
but no!

01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:48.600
OMG, Dreamcast 2.

01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:49.600
I wish!

01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:50.600
Jumbo Safari packet game.

01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:53.840
Well, wasn't Jumbo Safari, like, kind of a gun game almost?

01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:54.840
Sort of.

01:01:54.840 --> 01:01:55.840
Yeah, it was.

01:01:55.840 --> 01:01:56.840
Well, it's like a harpoon thing.

01:01:56.840 --> 01:01:57.840
No, you lassoed him.

01:01:57.840 --> 01:01:58.840
It's a harpoon.

01:01:58.840 --> 01:01:59.840
Harpoon.

01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:00.840
Har-poo.

01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:01.840
Har-poo.

01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:05.480
Frisbee calls it Pokemon Snafrica.

01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:07.360
There you go.

01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:11.800
The only bad thing about this thing, and, you know, no offense to Majesco, but Majesco's

01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:16.680
putting it out, and, I mean, seriously, what was the last good game for Majesco to come

01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:17.680
out?

01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:23.000
I'll give you a hint, there's one game that they put out in the Wii that I remember, and

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:27.760
that was at, oh, fuck, what was it called?

01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:31.640
Bust a Move Bash or whatever, you know, it was a puzzle game, you can't really innovate

01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:36.800
that much, but let me put it this way, the screenshots don't show much detail.

01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:38.320
But there's a dead wildebeest.

01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:42.360
I want to know why I can't run these things over with my car.

01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:45.360
I'm going to be able to do that in Far Cry 2, so that's, at least I have that to look

01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:46.360
forward to.

01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:49.760
Alright, well, earlier in the show we were talking about GameStop and one of their latest

01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:50.760
adventures with Nintendo.

01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:55.220
Well, that's not the only adventure GameStop has announced that they're going on this week.

01:02:55.220 --> 01:02:59.560
They are going to start creating tournament centers.

01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:04.360
What this is, is it's something that's in addition to a standard retail store, and the

01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:09.040
kiosks where you play the games on, instead of there just being one, there's a ton of

01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:10.040
them.

01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:13.440
Now, they're opening one of these in San Jose, and gosh, part of me kind of wants to go down

01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:16.040
and check it out, maybe do a report for the show because it's not that far, and I go there

01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:17.040
a lot.

01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:21.880
But anyhow, apparently these places are going to have 24 networked gaming stations.

01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:25.540
They're all going to have plasma display on it, and they're supposed to be doing various

01:03:25.540 --> 01:03:27.980
competitions in these places.

01:03:27.980 --> 01:03:30.580
Most weekends are when they're supposed to be doing it.

01:03:30.580 --> 01:03:33.260
They're going to kick it off with a Madden tournament.

01:03:33.260 --> 01:03:38.640
And the winner of the Madden tournament gets a $1,000 GameStop shopping spree, which they

01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:41.640
could spend right there in the store.

01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:44.820
I can't see how this is going to make them any money.

01:03:44.820 --> 01:03:49.840
Is this like their idea of countering a LAN center, and that way of putting it on them?

01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:54.140
Well, here's the thing, I don't know if they're going to be countering LAN centers, but one

01:03:54.140 --> 01:03:59.560
of their competition chains that's kind of up and coming, they're starting to do this

01:03:59.560 --> 01:04:03.360
play-and-trade is really, I think they're starting to take notes of that, and their

01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:07.040
big thing is that they run tournaments, and they organize them nationwide and stuff like

01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:10.340
that, and they run tournaments in the store a lot.

01:04:10.340 --> 01:04:11.800
So they may be trying to compete with that.

01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:16.440
But here's the thing, I don't understand how they're going to make any money from this.

01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:21.560
I mean, really, I just, I don't know.

01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:24.920
I mean, they're going to have all these TVs set up, unless they're charging people to

01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:26.720
play on this stuff, like running out time.

01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:28.600
Well, I imagine they have to be.

01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:34.740
You pay a $20, $30 entry fee, and if you get 50 people to enter it, there's a $1,000 prize

01:04:34.740 --> 01:04:36.880
right there, and anything additional is just extra money.

01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:40.360
And with a game like Madden that's so competitive, I don't know.

01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:45.400
It's going to be tough, though, because I know those other places, they don't charge

01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:46.400
for tournaments and stuff.

01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:50.000
Okay, plus, you get all those gamers in one place, and then what are you going to do?

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:54.200
You're going to put out a table full of Madden merchandise out there for them to buy, right?

01:04:54.200 --> 01:04:58.600
Like, I can think of DDR tournaments I went to where Red Octane would come in and they

01:04:58.600 --> 01:05:02.040
would have a table, because this was back before Red Octane was big for Guitar Hero.

01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:06.820
They would come and they would sell dance pads and soundtracks and all the DDR crap

01:05:06.820 --> 01:05:11.440
there at the tournament, and that's how they made money.

01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:14.760
It's really a good idea, I mean, honestly.

01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:15.760
But I don't know.

01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:17.920
It's like selling t-shirts at a concert.

01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:19.920
Yeah, I suppose.

01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:24.240
Also, GS68, they've seen one at the Santa Más at the Stevens Creek GameStop.

01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:28.920
I've shopped there before, by the way, that's actually right next to my Grand Princess.

01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:33.760
But I don't know.

01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:37.360
The only reason why is I know a lot of people that own land centers, and they own places

01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:42.160
like this where they rent out time, and hell, we knew, was it Rina, they used to have something

01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:43.200
similar like this.

01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:47.840
It's very hard to make money from them, and I know it may be tied in with GameStop, and

01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:51.560
you run any tournaments and stuff, but I don't think it's going to work out for them.

01:05:51.560 --> 01:05:54.400
I really don't think that they're going to make enough money to make it worth their wild,

01:05:54.400 --> 01:06:01.480
so I mean, they're testing it, but we'll just see if it actually ends up working out for

01:06:01.480 --> 01:06:02.480
them.

01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:03.480
I don't think it will be.

01:06:03.480 --> 01:06:04.480
We'll see.

01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:05.480
We'll see.

01:06:05.480 --> 01:06:07.080
All right, well, let's move on with some more gaming news.

01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:09.600
If we have any listeners in San Jose that have happened to check this place out, let

01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:10.600
us know.

01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:13.240
If not, I'll try to make it a point to go by there in the near future.

01:06:13.240 --> 01:06:14.240
We'll see.

01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:19.200
There are some details released about Tomb Raider Underworld that's being developed by

01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:21.600
Crystal Dynamics.

01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:33.040
It should be out next year on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC, and is going to be...

01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:41.120
They were actually quoted in Play Magazine as saying it was pure woman versus wild.

01:06:41.120 --> 01:06:48.040
I'm really, I don't know, because I think there's way too many Tomb Raider games already,

01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:52.680
but I did think, though, that it is pretty cool that they have a new lighting model for

01:06:52.680 --> 01:06:55.560
what will be going on in the game.

01:06:55.560 --> 01:06:58.800
I think it's pretty cool that they're...

01:06:58.800 --> 01:07:04.420
I like the more technical side of it, so I would check it out just to at least look at

01:07:04.420 --> 01:07:07.320
something online to see how it turns out.

01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:12.680
Well, Tomb Raider is one of those series that just won't die, and this is for us to approve

01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:15.360
it.

01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:16.360
Here's another series.

01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:21.280
Well, I don't know if it's going to be a series, but maybe a game that should die.

01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:25.080
The Prince's Bride game, which doesn't look all that wonderful.

01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:29.920
I mean, it looks like, to be honest, like a CDI game.

01:07:29.920 --> 01:07:36.840
Anyways, according to a new G4 interview, they've gotten some information direct from

01:07:36.840 --> 01:07:38.600
the developer's mouths.

01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:46.640
Apparently, well, the game itself, the target demographic, I believe, was women for it.

01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:50.000
They said that they're not going to be using a lot of the voice actors.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:53.560
It's actually going to be sound-alikes for the voices.

01:07:53.560 --> 01:08:03.360
And of course, they're saying that the game's going to be out spring of 2008 on PC.

01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:06.960
And if you like, you can pre-order it at the official site, princessbridegame.com.

01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:10.720
Oh, the game doesn't look that good.

01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:11.720
I looked at that picture.

01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:13.760
It does look like a CDI game.

01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:19.160
I mean, they'd have to use sound-alikes anyway, at least for some of them, because, you know,

01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:21.800
Andre the Giant's dead.

01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:24.720
So you should make him talk anyways.

01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:30.200
Splice clips together, like that one show after Chef left the show, right?

01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:31.200
Never mind.

01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:37.800
Anyhow, we're going to debut a brand new segment on tonight's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:41.880
And I can't say this is necessarily going to be a weekly segment, but it is going to

01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:46.600
be a segment that we're going to do on the show whenever something makes us feel like

01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:48.560
we need to do this segment.

01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:49.780
It's not a new game.

01:08:49.780 --> 01:08:53.960
It's not a new advice column or anything like that.

01:08:53.960 --> 01:09:02.680
So, it is something we call here at Orange Lounge Radio the Stupid Award.

01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:03.680
That's right.

01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:07.580
Whenever we here at Orange Lounge Radio feel like somebody has done something extraordinarily

01:09:07.580 --> 01:09:15.920
stupid this week in the gaming industry, we're going to award them with the OLR Stupid Award.

01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:21.080
So this week, the Stupid Award goes to this kid, and I'm probably going to mispronounce

01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:22.080
his name, but that's okay.

01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:23.080
He's stupid.

01:09:23.080 --> 01:09:25.440
He's going to be playing Aliyu Shaw.

01:09:25.440 --> 01:09:26.440
And what did he do?

01:09:26.440 --> 01:09:33.560
Well, he went on to Xbox Live and he was playing Call of Duty 4, and he sent messages to kids

01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:34.560
on Xbox Live.

01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:38.880
He was playing Call of Duty 4, and he told them that he was going to shoot up his school

01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:41.560
and tell everybody on there how he was going to do it.

01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:47.120
Well, sure enough, a Call of Duty 4 player from Oregon went to the police department

01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:53.680
and Microsoft ended up letting out the IP who tracked down this guy and arrested him.

01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:58.040
Now, the kid later admitted that the whole thing was just a joke, he had no intention

01:09:58.040 --> 01:10:03.840
of actually going through with it, there were no guns to be found or whatever, but still,

01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:09.080
why would you say this kind of crap on Xbox Live, especially in this day and age in the

01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:10.080
world we live in.

01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:17.760
So, congratulations, Aliyu Shaw, winner of the inaugural OLR Stupid Award!

01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:18.760
Yay!

01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:25.600
That's right, out of the gene pool.

01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:26.600
Get out.

01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:28.360
Let's get a little bleach in there.

01:10:28.360 --> 01:10:34.880
All right, let's move on to a segment that we've done for a while now and it's a well-loved

01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:36.440
segment here at Orange Lounge Radio.

01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:43.160
It is the Classic Game of the Week and every week DarkSakura picks a favorite classic game

01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:48.040
of hers and we basically pay tribute to our elders and respect them a little bit through

01:10:48.040 --> 01:10:53.000
our Classic Game of the Week, so DarkSakura, tell us about what game you picked out for

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
us this week.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:11:02.160
The Game of the Week is the X-Men arcade game, the old one you could find either one screen

01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:09.520
or two screens, I do believe that the differences were a four-player and a six-player.

01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:14.440
I played the hell out of this game when I was in tenth grade.

01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:20.120
My arcade actually had a two-screen set-up, so I used to play a whole crap-let of this,

01:11:20.120 --> 01:11:28.080
but it was put out by Konami and it's the final fight-style game, you know, the side-scrolling

01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:32.560
beat-crap-up game, you know, or like the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles games, even though a lot

01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:34.400
of these were floating around that time.

01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:39.720
But you could play as Cyclops, Colossus, Wolverine, Storm, Nightcrawler, or Gavlar, and I actually

01:11:39.720 --> 01:11:42.680
use Gavlar almost all the time.

01:11:42.680 --> 01:11:46.320
And you beat up the world's shortest sentinels, because they were really supposed to be massive,

01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:48.920
but they were like, little.

01:11:48.920 --> 01:11:55.840
And it had the most, I swear, this would have all been candidates for everse.com, the things

01:11:55.840 --> 01:11:58.160
that they would say in the game.

01:11:58.160 --> 01:12:06.600
Now, I didn't realize this for quite a while, but the version that I played at one of the,

01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:11.440
not my main arcade, but the second arcade, was actually a Japanese version, because they

01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:17.280
would drop extra power-ups that would refuel the power meter, and apparently the American

01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:18.760
ones did not.

01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:20.960
So I was like, this is hard!

01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:24.080
It was too easy.

01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:29.000
So it was full of crap.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:36.080
I mean, it was a really fun game, and I wish that there had been, you know, a home release

01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:41.400
without me having to bust out the maze, but it was a lot of fun.

01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:43.400
Alright, well, some comments from Chatroom.

01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:48.560
Tigerclaw wants to remind us, this was also the only X-Men game released by Konami, hence

01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:50.880
why it feels so much like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:55.200
That's why I was saying that it was in that type.

01:12:55.200 --> 01:12:58.080
Now, ActDeft sounds like he has the best arcade ever.

01:12:58.080 --> 01:13:02.240
He says, my arcade used to have this, TMNT Arcade, and Turtles in Time.

01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:08.280
Turtles in Time was freaking great, but this was my game before Turtles in Time.

01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:12.280
However, Dillinger would like to share that the Simpsons arcade game was better.

01:13:12.280 --> 01:13:13.480
I doubt that.

01:13:13.480 --> 01:13:14.920
Simpsons did it.

01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:17.560
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:20.960
I actually really liked this one a whole lot better.

01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:25.240
Alright, so there it is, your classic game of the week, X-Men, as done by the arcade,

01:13:25.240 --> 01:13:28.080
and I'm just pausing our little YouTubage of the game here.

01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:30.940
Bonus, you are granted a special mutant power.

01:13:30.940 --> 01:13:35.980
Note that mutant power can be used only when the energy indicator is at three or less.

01:13:35.980 --> 01:13:37.680
Is that like now a second mutation?

01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:38.680
I don't know.

01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:40.400
For anyone who reads the comics.

01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:41.400
I don't know.

01:13:41.400 --> 01:13:44.800
Anyhow, that's going to bring this part A of our program to a close.

01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:48.920
We're going to take a quick break and we will be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio

01:13:48.920 --> 01:13:49.920
right after this.

01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:54.880
Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcasted to the world twice

01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:55.880
a week.

01:13:55.880 --> 01:14:19.320
Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
