00:00.000 --> 00:21.440
Today, December 2nd, 2007, the Wii gets DS demo downloads, Sony swaps out their ad agency,

00:21.440 --> 00:32.240
and DIVX comes to Xbox in the next update.

00:32.240 --> 00:36.240
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge

00:36.240 --> 00:37.240
Radio.

00:37.240 --> 00:42.600
We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer

00:42.600 --> 00:43.720
lifestyle.

00:43.720 --> 00:48.900
For those of you out there who have recently turned to independent radio this week in light

00:48.900 --> 00:52.320
of recent events, a warm welcome from all of us here at OLR.

00:52.320 --> 00:57.640
My name is Rob Roberts, joining me not tonight is the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers,

00:57.640 --> 01:02.000
she is still on vacation, I believe she's coming back to town tonight, we'll see her

01:02.000 --> 01:06.680
back on the show next week, but meanwhile holding down the old fort is the one and only

01:06.680 --> 01:07.680
Loki.

01:07.680 --> 01:08.680
Yes, I'm here.

01:08.680 --> 01:09.680
How you doing?

01:09.680 --> 01:10.680
Good.

01:10.680 --> 01:11.680
Good.

01:11.680 --> 01:14.000
Playing Phantom Hourglass right up until the last second I see.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
Yes I am.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.440
But we'll get to your gaming week in just a little bit.

01:17.440 --> 01:22.400
We are joined tonight by the lovely Rice Princess filling in tonight.

01:22.400 --> 01:23.400
Hello.

01:23.400 --> 01:26.440
So it's not just the Rob and Loki show, because otherwise.

01:26.440 --> 01:28.000
It'd be pretty fucking boring.

01:28.000 --> 01:31.040
It might be pretty fucking boring, you put two nerds together and stuff.

01:31.040 --> 01:32.360
So we brought in a third nerd.

01:32.360 --> 01:33.360
So hello Rice Princess.

01:33.360 --> 01:36.380
And then it becomes great, like three nerds makes it better.

01:36.380 --> 01:39.960
I think there was a sitcom, wasn't there, like three nerds, three mics and a pizza place,

01:39.960 --> 01:41.960
I don't know.

01:41.960 --> 01:46.600
Anyhow, I hate that the cam is down this week and I'll talk more about that later because

01:46.600 --> 01:49.280
Irene has the greatest nerdy shirt in the world.

01:49.280 --> 01:51.480
And where'd you, is this something you got from Hot Gothic?

01:51.480 --> 01:52.480
Yeah.

01:52.480 --> 01:53.480
Okay, it's a Metroid shirt.

01:53.480 --> 01:55.520
It's basically the box art from Metroid.

01:55.520 --> 01:56.520
And what does it say?

01:56.520 --> 01:57.520
Can you defeat the mother brain?

01:57.520 --> 01:58.520
Or no, beat the mother brain.

01:58.520 --> 01:59.520
Beat the mother brain.

01:59.520 --> 02:02.200
But you bought me a shirt too from Hot Topic, right?

02:02.200 --> 02:03.200
I did.

02:03.200 --> 02:04.200
I'm so excited.

02:04.200 --> 02:05.200
I love presents.

02:05.200 --> 02:06.200
I'm going to open it.

02:06.200 --> 02:07.200
I haven't actually opened it yet.

02:07.200 --> 02:08.480
So I'm opening it here live on air.

02:08.480 --> 02:10.040
Really sucks that the cam's down this week.

02:10.040 --> 02:12.720
I know, but it's not gaming related at all.

02:12.720 --> 02:13.720
It's not.

02:13.720 --> 02:14.720
It's not gaming related at all.

02:14.720 --> 02:15.720
Oh well.

02:15.720 --> 02:16.720
That's okay.

02:16.720 --> 02:18.280
I'll pretend I didn't see the tag.

02:18.280 --> 02:19.280
Yeah.

02:19.280 --> 02:20.280
You should do that.

02:20.280 --> 02:21.280
Oh my God.

02:21.280 --> 02:22.280
What is it?

02:22.280 --> 02:24.880
Hey, that's awesome.

02:24.880 --> 02:26.880
It's a Pee Wee Herman shirt.

02:26.880 --> 02:27.880
It's cherry.

02:27.880 --> 02:32.600
No, you should turn it over to the front because that's the back, I'm sure.

02:32.600 --> 02:33.600
Oh, Pee Wee's Playhouse.

02:33.600 --> 02:34.600
Oh, that's awesome.

02:34.600 --> 02:38.920
Yeah, it was me at the back that had Pee Wee on cherry.

02:38.920 --> 02:39.920
You're like, wow.

02:39.920 --> 02:40.920
Isn't that a Pee Wee?

02:40.920 --> 02:41.920
It's so exciting.

02:41.920 --> 02:42.920
Pee Wee and cherry.

02:42.920 --> 02:43.920
It's awesome.

02:43.920 --> 02:44.920
I love Pee Wee's Playhouse.

02:44.920 --> 02:45.920
I'm glad you do.

02:45.920 --> 02:46.920
It's great.

02:46.920 --> 02:48.560
Because otherwise that'd be a pretty shitty present.

02:48.560 --> 02:51.920
Otherwise it's like, here's a shirt of a show you don't like.

02:51.920 --> 02:54.160
I just thought you needed new clothes, Rob.

02:54.160 --> 02:55.160
That's great.

02:55.160 --> 02:56.600
I will definitely wear that next week.

02:56.600 --> 02:58.480
Hopefully the cam's back next week.

02:58.480 --> 03:00.880
What happened to the cam, BTW?

03:00.880 --> 03:02.400
I'll talk more about that in a little bit.

03:02.400 --> 03:03.400
Okay.

03:03.400 --> 03:05.520
But let's start it off with how was your gaming week?

03:05.520 --> 03:06.520
Loki wants to start us off tonight.

03:06.520 --> 03:07.520
How was your gaming week?

03:07.520 --> 03:11.920
I didn't play as much as I thought I would be playing this week, but mainly my week was

03:11.920 --> 03:16.480
filled with Phantom Hourglass, and it's fun.

03:16.480 --> 03:18.760
It's a normal Zelda game.

03:18.760 --> 03:21.840
Don't really know what more you'd want.

03:21.840 --> 03:24.560
Sorry, can I interject here for a minute?

03:24.560 --> 03:25.560
Yeah.

03:25.560 --> 03:27.560
I'm looking at our chat room, which I neglected to introduce.

03:27.560 --> 03:28.560
Sorry, chat.

03:28.560 --> 03:29.560
Chat.orangelaunchradio.com.

03:29.560 --> 03:30.560
We love the chat room.

03:30.560 --> 03:31.560
They always crack us up.

03:31.560 --> 03:36.080
And you know how just a little bit ago I was saying, what, three nerds, a mic, and whatever.

03:36.080 --> 03:42.360
DJ Jinai comments, where's the cup?

03:42.360 --> 03:43.360
Get it?

03:43.360 --> 03:44.360
Yeah.

03:44.360 --> 03:45.360
All right, anyway.

03:45.360 --> 03:46.360
Sorry.

03:46.360 --> 03:47.360
Ew.

03:47.360 --> 03:48.360
Delayed reaction.

03:48.360 --> 03:49.360
Yeah.

03:49.360 --> 03:50.360
Totally didn't get it.

03:50.360 --> 03:54.440
You were the one that kept asking me all week long, have you seen the two girls, one cup

03:54.440 --> 03:55.440
thing yet?

03:55.440 --> 03:57.960
I did not ask you.

03:57.960 --> 04:01.480
That's perverted and gross.

04:01.480 --> 04:04.520
Anyway, sorry, Loki.

04:04.520 --> 04:05.520
Anyways.

04:05.520 --> 04:09.160
So yeah, I've been playing Phantom Hourglass and it's fun.

04:09.160 --> 04:11.480
So what else they play?

04:11.480 --> 04:16.200
I tried the Wii version of the Golden Compass because Nellie wanted me to demonstrate the

04:16.200 --> 04:21.240
game for her since she's really into Golden Compass and that's who I got the game for

04:21.240 --> 04:22.240
her.

04:22.240 --> 04:23.640
So it's OK.

04:23.640 --> 04:25.400
It's pretty easy.

04:25.400 --> 04:28.280
But I guess it's based off of a video game, obviously.

04:28.280 --> 04:29.480
Your starts off is...

04:29.480 --> 04:30.480
You mean based off a movie?

04:30.480 --> 04:32.480
Well, yeah, it's based off a movie.

04:32.480 --> 04:33.920
Excellent reviews by the one and only Loki.

04:33.920 --> 04:35.800
It's based off of a book, also.

04:35.800 --> 04:40.680
And you play a giant fucking polar bear that, you know, abuses wolves, apparently.

04:40.680 --> 04:44.420
Because it's like, I kind of feel bad for the wolves because they're attacking you and

04:44.420 --> 04:47.360
you're just like this giant fucking polar bear with armor on it.

04:47.360 --> 04:52.480
It's like, as if, you know, a wolf versus a polar bear was going to win in the first

04:52.480 --> 04:53.480
place.

04:53.480 --> 04:55.080
This bear is fucking tricked out with armor.

04:55.080 --> 04:56.760
There's no fucking way it's going to win.

04:56.760 --> 05:01.080
OK, but like, look at Final Fantasy XI, where like, you could fight a bunny and the bunny

05:01.080 --> 05:03.000
rapes you for 500 points of damage.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.320
I mean, it's...

05:04.320 --> 05:05.840
Sometimes video games don't make sense.

05:05.840 --> 05:10.840
Well, I haven't fought any bunnies yet, but as far as the wolves go, I kick the crap out

05:10.840 --> 05:13.400
of them over and over and over again.

05:13.400 --> 05:16.480
I don't know, you make the Golden Compass sound pretty awesome when you talk about polar

05:16.480 --> 05:17.960
bears and sets of armor.

05:17.960 --> 05:18.960
Well, apparently...

05:18.960 --> 05:19.960
Oh, wait, you don't even know.

05:19.960 --> 05:24.280
I haven't read the book or seen the movie yet, but apparently the characters in this

05:24.280 --> 05:29.560
story have their souls outside of their body as an animal, and the animal like, talks in

05:29.560 --> 05:32.220
the same voice as the girl in the game.

05:32.220 --> 05:37.120
So it's confusing, because it sounds like the girl's having conversations with herself,

05:37.120 --> 05:41.440
and it's like, you know, one will say, yeah, let's do that again, and the girl's like,

05:41.440 --> 05:42.440
I don't want to do that again.

05:42.440 --> 05:44.440
It's like, what the fuck?

05:44.440 --> 05:45.440
Make up your mind.

05:45.440 --> 05:47.840
Maybe she really is talking to herself, and she's crazy.

05:47.840 --> 05:50.480
No, she has this like, panther cat thing on the back.

05:50.480 --> 05:54.680
It looks like a house cat, but apparently it's like a panther or something like that,

05:54.680 --> 06:00.400
and then it can transform into a sloth too, so I don't know, it's some crazy shit.

06:00.400 --> 06:03.900
But I will not be playing any more of that game.

06:03.900 --> 06:06.760
I did play Super Mario Galaxy, though, because I was sick this week.

06:06.760 --> 06:07.760
What did you think of it?

06:07.760 --> 06:10.040
Well, I'm still playing it, and it's fun.

06:10.040 --> 06:16.080
It's very, very, very much like Mario 64, I mean, same kind of setup, just, you know,

06:16.080 --> 06:17.080
no red coins.

06:17.080 --> 06:29.160
Other than that, I don't know, that's pretty much it, I think, from Saints Row, and yeah.

06:29.160 --> 06:30.680
What's so funny about Saints Row?

06:30.680 --> 06:33.280
No, just like, you're playing Saints Row.

06:33.280 --> 06:35.400
Oh, and Earth Defense Force 2017.

06:35.400 --> 06:36.400
Of course.

06:36.400 --> 06:37.400
Still playing some of that.

06:37.400 --> 06:38.400
Of course.

06:38.400 --> 06:42.040
We went and tried to beat the second to last level on Inferno, and that's like getting

06:42.040 --> 06:44.720
raped by thousands of ants at the same time.

06:44.720 --> 06:46.720
It's not very fun.

06:46.720 --> 06:47.720
Nice.

06:47.720 --> 06:52.640
Let's see, my gaming week, I didn't play a whole lot of new stuff, unfortunately, I've

06:52.640 --> 06:53.640
just been very busy.

06:53.640 --> 06:56.400
I've been watching my roommate play a hell of a lot of puzzle quests, though, on Xbox

06:56.400 --> 07:00.480
Live Arcade, which is kind of funny, because he doesn't get into a lot of video games,

07:00.480 --> 07:04.120
but when he does, he definitely puts, he's committed.

07:04.120 --> 07:06.640
So he's been very committed to puzzle quests, he's already at like level 20, he's gotten

07:06.640 --> 07:08.400
way further in the game than I have.

07:08.400 --> 07:09.400
That's crazy.

07:09.400 --> 07:15.760
Yeah, so he's enjoying that, and other than that, I've just been playing the regular World

07:15.760 --> 07:19.840
of Warcraft and Final Fantasy XI, you know, because I just love my MMOs.

07:19.840 --> 07:20.840
Ew.

07:20.840 --> 07:21.840
I know.

07:21.840 --> 07:25.800
I've been playing Rock Band, I went online with Rock Band this week, and I gotta say,

07:25.800 --> 07:31.040
I'm just pissed off that you can't do band co-op mode, I mean, what the hell, why did

07:31.040 --> 07:32.040
they leave that out?

07:32.040 --> 07:35.640
Because you can do band competitive, well, it's not even really competitive, but you

07:35.640 --> 07:40.640
can do like the one song stuff online, like one song at a time, but you can't do the World

07:40.640 --> 07:45.560
Tour mode online, which seems kind of stupid, because it's not like the game's unable to

07:45.560 --> 07:47.580
let four people play online at once.

07:47.580 --> 07:51.560
That was kind of, like, one of the reasons I was excited about Rock Band is I kind of

07:51.560 --> 07:55.880
thought you were going to be able to make these bands together with people from far

07:55.880 --> 07:56.880
away.

07:56.880 --> 07:59.680
Shane, who hasn't been on the show in a long time because he lives in Kansas, also bought

07:59.680 --> 08:02.360
the game, and I was thinking, oh, we could have a band, and we'd play together, it'd

08:02.360 --> 08:03.360
be fun.

08:03.360 --> 08:06.240
But we do have a band already.

08:06.240 --> 08:13.160
A Rock Band, not a real band, where, you know, I play Kazoo, and Irene plays the tambourine.

08:13.160 --> 08:14.800
You know, a Rock Band band.

08:14.800 --> 08:15.800
Anyhow.

08:15.800 --> 08:16.800
Good times.

08:16.800 --> 08:21.960
So I was just pissed that co-op mode was kind of missing in that regard.

08:21.960 --> 08:25.440
Otherwise, they did have a David Bowie pack come out this week, and that was pretty awesome.

08:25.440 --> 08:26.440
Oh, really?

08:26.440 --> 08:27.560
Because David Bowie is very awesome.

08:27.560 --> 08:28.560
He is.

08:28.560 --> 08:29.560
Yes.

08:29.560 --> 08:30.560
There's like a cover of Heroes.

08:30.560 --> 08:31.560
It's good.

08:31.560 --> 08:32.560
Good times.

08:32.560 --> 08:33.560
Nice.

08:33.560 --> 08:34.560
That's really it.

08:34.560 --> 08:35.560
Not a lot else to note.

08:35.560 --> 08:36.560
Not a lot of new games this week.

08:36.560 --> 08:40.000
Oh, I did play Undertow, but I don't know, just not my kind of game.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
I wasn't feeling it.

08:41.000 --> 08:46.160
I tried to, it was hard to, I mean, it wasn't hard to figure it out or figure the game out,

08:46.160 --> 08:50.240
but I thought the tutorial could have been a little better, because there was so many

08:50.240 --> 08:51.240
different little features.

08:51.240 --> 08:55.740
I forgot to mention it last week, and it hasn't really been on any of the websites yet, but

08:55.740 --> 09:02.000
they released the Pay the Unlock content for Katamari.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
We love Katamari.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.700
Or, not we love Katamari, beautiful Katamari.

09:05.700 --> 09:10.120
And so I bought that, and then afterwards, I'm like, why did I buy that?

09:10.120 --> 09:12.200
That's a good question.

09:12.200 --> 09:13.200
Why did you buy that?

09:13.200 --> 09:14.200
It was an impulse buy.

09:14.200 --> 09:21.440
I bought one of those $20 cards, 1600 point cards, well I didn't buy it per se, I got

09:21.440 --> 09:29.680
crap that I didn't want, and I traded it for a free card, so I can thank a PS3 copy of

09:29.680 --> 09:36.920
Assassin's Creed that bought me Rock Band songs and beautiful Katamari download content.

09:36.920 --> 09:40.720
Sephiroth1215 in our chatroom says Rock Band World Tour wouldn't work online.

09:40.720 --> 09:41.720
Why not?

09:41.720 --> 09:42.720
I don't get it.

09:42.720 --> 09:43.720
It should.

09:43.720 --> 09:48.200
I mean, yeah, I see Black Lab talking about the vocals in the game, how you don't actually

09:48.200 --> 09:54.960
hear the people singing, although you kind of do, but you can have a full band in the

09:54.960 --> 09:58.960
play one song at a time mode co-op, I don't know what it is, just quick play or whatever

09:58.960 --> 10:04.200
it's called, and you can have a guitar, and I actually signed on Xbox Live and got a random

10:04.200 --> 10:07.480
band thrown together where some guy was on vocals, I was on guitar, somebody else was

10:07.480 --> 10:12.880
on bass, and somebody else was on drums, and we could hear the vocalist singing, it was

10:12.880 --> 10:17.800
just a little bit faint and very, very lagged because it was transmitting through his headset

10:17.800 --> 10:19.240
or whatever while he was singing.

10:19.240 --> 10:21.000
Oh, I fucking hate that shit.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.960
Yeah, but the game itself doesn't support that.

10:23.960 --> 10:26.360
It plays the normal backtrack because of the lag.

10:26.360 --> 10:29.360
Hey, that'd be kind of cool if you didn't do the vocal parts without people hearing

10:29.360 --> 10:30.360
you.

10:30.360 --> 10:31.360
I like that idea.

10:31.360 --> 10:35.120
Yeah, if you just turn your headset off, you can do it without people hearing you.

10:35.120 --> 10:38.400
They don't hear you.

10:38.400 --> 10:41.760
Loki has a secret desire to sing a little more often, doesn't he?

10:41.760 --> 10:42.760
No, I don't.

10:42.760 --> 10:43.760
I really don't.

10:43.760 --> 10:44.760
All right.

10:44.760 --> 10:47.600
I have a secret desire to get achievement points, and...

10:47.600 --> 10:49.600
All right.

10:49.600 --> 10:54.080
Rice Princess, have you been playing anything this week at all?

10:54.080 --> 10:55.080
Just WoW, really.

10:55.080 --> 10:56.080
WoW!

10:56.080 --> 10:57.080
How's WoW been going for you?

10:57.080 --> 10:58.080
It's been going excellent.

10:58.080 --> 11:03.600
I was going to deactivate my account, but for some reason I just decided not to, and

11:03.600 --> 11:07.240
then I leveled up like five levels this past week, so...

11:07.240 --> 11:10.560
Wait, WoW's been going great, so you were going to deactivate your account?

11:10.560 --> 11:15.160
No, it was being really boring, and I was like, I'm just using it as a glorified chat

11:15.160 --> 11:17.240
room, and then I was going to deactivate it.

11:17.240 --> 11:22.280
Then I just started leveling, and I was like, wait a minute, I like WoW again.

11:22.280 --> 11:23.280
What's going on?

11:23.280 --> 11:24.920
No, this is kind of fun again.

11:24.920 --> 11:26.160
Yeah, this is weird.

11:26.160 --> 11:30.240
Yeah, because, I don't know, WoW's been kind of boring for the past couple months, but

11:30.240 --> 11:31.240
now it's not.

11:31.240 --> 11:32.800
It's because our guild's too small.

11:32.800 --> 11:33.800
It's kind of sad.

11:33.800 --> 11:34.800
We have no tanks.

11:34.800 --> 11:35.800
We can't run instances together.

11:35.800 --> 11:36.800
We have no tanks.

11:36.800 --> 11:41.840
That's kind of what I think brought me back to playing is that, I don't know, some people

11:41.840 --> 11:46.800
were running me through instances, and I ran people through instances, and we have a guild

11:46.800 --> 11:48.880
bank now, and I'm totally into that.

11:48.880 --> 11:49.880
Guild banks are awesome.

11:49.880 --> 11:50.880
I don't know.

11:50.880 --> 11:52.520
It just became fun again.

11:52.520 --> 11:53.520
Well, good.

11:53.520 --> 11:54.520
Yeah.

11:54.520 --> 11:55.520
All right.

11:55.520 --> 11:58.680
All right, well, let's get into some housekeeping tonight, and then we'll get into the gaming

11:58.680 --> 11:59.680
news.

11:59.680 --> 12:03.760
Obviously, Dark Sakura is not here tonight, but she will be back next week.

12:03.760 --> 12:08.180
Perhaps we'll hear from her later in the show, but I think she's recovering from her trip.

12:08.180 --> 12:11.560
Our webcam, I said I'd say more about this later, Operator 11 is the service that we

12:11.560 --> 12:16.360
use to deliver the webcam feeds of our show, and they're down this week.

12:16.360 --> 12:21.000
They randomly went offline midweek, and then they've come back up with a placeholder page

12:21.000 --> 12:22.920
saying they're down.

12:22.920 --> 12:26.520
So that kind of sucks, but at the same time, you can't really complain because, A, they

12:26.520 --> 12:29.600
were in alpha, so it was an early thing, and B, it's free.

12:29.600 --> 12:32.720
It was very hard to complain about something that's free when it breaks, so we're trying

12:32.720 --> 12:34.160
not to be bitchy.

12:34.160 --> 12:38.520
But if it's not up next week, we probably will look into alternatives for what we can

12:38.520 --> 12:42.560
do to do the cam and everything, because the only bummer about that is that after last

12:42.560 --> 12:46.160
week's show, we finally did the great Zapper challenge.

12:46.160 --> 12:52.520
We had Loki on the regular Wiimote, and I used the Zapper, and we played Link's crossbow

12:52.520 --> 12:56.720
training, and the funny thing that happened is that in the practice round that we played,

12:56.720 --> 12:58.520
I fucking wasted Loki.

12:58.520 --> 13:00.320
My score was 10 times his score.

13:00.320 --> 13:01.320
It was crazy.

13:01.320 --> 13:04.560
I just obliterated him, but it was a practice round.

13:04.560 --> 13:07.440
And then when we did it for reals, Loki beat me by a thousand points.

13:07.440 --> 13:08.440
I was so mad.

13:08.440 --> 13:13.720
So Loki won the great Zapper challenge, proving that the Zapper does nothing to enhance the

13:13.720 --> 13:14.720
gameplay.

13:14.720 --> 13:17.680
And honestly, you playing the Zapper, it was crap, wasn't it?

13:17.680 --> 13:19.400
It wasn't that great.

13:19.400 --> 13:23.940
I can't say the experience was any better with the Zapper, but the crossbow training

13:23.940 --> 13:25.880
game was kind of fun, actually.

13:25.880 --> 13:30.060
To be devil's advocate and a little bit fair here, from what I hear, Ghost Squad, it's

13:30.060 --> 13:31.060
really good.

13:31.060 --> 13:35.080
And the reason why is because they have a good calibration system on it, where you aim

13:35.080 --> 13:38.600
down the Zapper at one corner of the screen, aim down the Zapper at the other corner of

13:38.600 --> 13:41.360
the screen, and then spot on after that.

13:41.360 --> 13:47.520
So I don't know why every game for the Wii doesn't have something like that in the first

13:47.520 --> 13:48.520
place.

13:48.520 --> 13:49.520
Really shouldn't have.

13:49.520 --> 13:54.320
I mean, that should be fucking a default thing to have in there, I mean, come on.

13:54.320 --> 14:00.340
But yeah, so if they add something like that to all the games, it'll be good.

14:00.340 --> 14:03.200
That's one good thing that Ghost Squad has going for it, and hopefully they'll have the

14:03.200 --> 14:08.520
same thing, I assume they'll have the same thing in House of the Dead 2 and 3.

14:08.520 --> 14:14.440
So I mean, the whole thing is only, what, 25 bucks for the Zapper and crossbow training?

14:14.440 --> 14:19.720
Technically $20, but GameStop is ripping everyone off by $5, they're overcharging over retail

14:19.720 --> 14:20.720
for it.

14:20.720 --> 14:23.200
So the Wii mode itself and Link's crossbow training is only 20 bucks?

14:23.200 --> 14:26.760
Well yeah, the Wii Zapper and the Link's crossbow training is only $20 retail.

14:26.760 --> 14:28.400
That's not bad, all things considered.

14:28.400 --> 14:29.440
That really isn't a bad deal.

14:29.440 --> 14:32.640
I mean, granted, the game is probably worth a little more money than, and the game is

14:32.640 --> 14:36.000
short, I mean, it's something you're going to beat pretty quickly, but I think it's,

14:36.000 --> 14:41.280
you know, it's a Wii Sports-ish kind of thing where the game doesn't have a lot of depth,

14:41.280 --> 14:44.240
but you're going to have a lot of people that want to just kind of pick it up and play it

14:44.240 --> 14:45.240
and have fun with it.

14:45.240 --> 14:47.800
Because it's not like the game was that difficult to figure out.

14:47.800 --> 14:51.600
So I thought it was kind of fun.

14:51.600 --> 14:53.100
But that sucks that Loki won the bet.

14:53.100 --> 14:57.640
So no date for me and Loki gets, is the wife going to let me take her out or what?

14:57.640 --> 14:58.640
I don't know.

14:58.640 --> 14:59.640
I'm going to have to talk about that this week.

14:59.640 --> 15:00.640
I think that happened.

15:00.640 --> 15:02.640
So you can have your night of peace.

15:02.640 --> 15:03.640
Yeah.

15:03.640 --> 15:09.960
Anyways, I was going to say for next week, because I have a whole bunch of games on,

15:09.960 --> 15:13.560
you know, I guess a queue to play.

15:13.560 --> 15:14.720
A bunch of import stuff.

15:14.720 --> 15:20.080
Dragon Quest Swords for the Wii, Harvest Moon for the Wii, why the fuck am I going to play

15:20.080 --> 15:21.080
Harvest Moon?

15:21.080 --> 15:24.800
I fucking hate Harvest Moon, but I'm going to try it anyways on the Wii for the hell

15:24.800 --> 15:28.160
of it.

15:28.160 --> 15:32.200
Devil Kings 2 for the Wii, which I hear is really fucking good.

15:32.200 --> 15:34.440
I'm going to try that out.

15:34.440 --> 15:39.320
And then DDR Haas Party for the Wii, the Japanese version, because they have a few different

15:39.320 --> 15:41.600
songs that I want to try out.

15:41.600 --> 15:45.520
And I'm going to do the All Controller Controller Revolution, because it does support the classic

15:45.520 --> 15:47.920
controller to do that, which I didn't know.

15:47.920 --> 15:54.000
I was like, oh, okay, I'll do it that way, because I don't want to buy a dance bet.

15:54.000 --> 15:59.260
And then, I'm trying to think of what else I had, Cruis'n, probably one of the worst

15:59.260 --> 16:05.160
racing games out there, by, you know, screenshots at least, so I'm going to play it to see how

16:05.160 --> 16:06.280
crappy it is.

16:06.280 --> 16:11.280
Then another game that I know is going to be even worse, which is Off-Road Extreme Special

16:11.280 --> 16:16.040
Edition is what it's called, and it's another piece of shit that's coming out there.

16:16.040 --> 16:18.040
I'll play them so you don't have to.

16:18.040 --> 16:20.440
Hey, you know what though?

16:20.440 --> 16:21.440
Crappy games can be good.

16:21.440 --> 16:27.200
In fact, I saw today they have the box shots for the Simple Series 3 and 4 coming out for

16:27.200 --> 16:29.200
the Wii in Japan.

16:29.200 --> 16:32.840
Simple Series 1, I'm also going to be playing Meet-a-Dick Kart Race, another kart racing

16:32.840 --> 16:33.840
game.

16:33.840 --> 16:35.200
So, lots of stuff for next week.

16:35.200 --> 16:36.640
When do we get the WiiWare?

16:36.640 --> 16:37.640
Is that ever going to come out?

16:37.640 --> 16:38.640
I thought that was supposed to come out this year.

16:38.640 --> 16:39.640
I know, I know.

16:39.640 --> 16:43.720
Oh, and when I get paid this week, I'm going to import Wii Fit.

16:43.720 --> 16:45.080
Interesting.

16:45.080 --> 16:46.360
And I'm going to use Wii Fit.

16:46.360 --> 16:48.240
You must really want to get Wii Fit.

16:48.240 --> 16:49.680
I do want to get Wii Fit.

16:49.680 --> 16:50.880
Wow, I hope it works for you.

16:50.880 --> 16:53.880
I would be very curious to see how Wii Fit works for you.

16:53.880 --> 16:56.600
We should make a diary of your progress and all that fun stuff.

16:56.600 --> 16:58.000
I think that would be a good idea.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.600
Alright, we'll have to get on that.

16:59.600 --> 17:00.600
Alright, let's see.

17:00.600 --> 17:05.800
Looking in the chat room, DJ Jenai, talking about the Wii, says, I noticed that Nintendo

17:05.800 --> 17:09.840
released a game on Virtual Console that Compile made, so maybe it's possible for Nintendo

17:09.840 --> 17:11.080
to release the Guardian Legend.

17:11.080 --> 17:12.960
God, I only hope so.

17:12.960 --> 17:15.080
Those who have been listening to Orange and Andreo for any length of time know that we

17:15.080 --> 17:18.840
have a very soft spot in our hearts for the 8-bit classic, the Guardian Legend, so the

17:18.840 --> 17:23.720
day that comes out on the Wii, I'm calling in sick to work.

17:23.720 --> 17:24.720
Let's see.

17:24.720 --> 17:28.600
Odd1 says, the damn system will tell you six ways from Sunday.

17:28.600 --> 17:32.280
Don't kill people with your Wii mode and go out once in a while, you fat fuck, on every

17:32.280 --> 17:36.800
game, but they don't think to help us calibrate the things to play the game better.

17:36.800 --> 17:41.200
And I love that new warnings grant they have, that thing looks like a fucking condom on

17:41.200 --> 17:42.200
there.

17:42.200 --> 17:43.200
I'm sorry.

17:43.200 --> 17:44.200
It is the ugliest.

17:44.200 --> 17:45.200
With the Wii condom.

17:45.200 --> 17:46.200
It is the ugliest thing.

17:46.200 --> 17:47.200
You know what?

17:47.200 --> 17:48.400
I'm playing fucking dangerously, okay?

17:48.400 --> 17:53.300
I don't use the wrist strap, and even if I did, I have the original wrist strap.

17:53.300 --> 17:55.040
No fucking condom on it, man.

17:55.040 --> 17:58.720
I'm living dangerously.

17:58.720 --> 18:01.400
You're playing your Wii promiscuously.

18:01.400 --> 18:02.400
You bad boy.

18:02.400 --> 18:07.720
It's all skin against skin with my Wii there.

18:07.720 --> 18:08.720
Nice.

18:08.720 --> 18:09.720
Wow.

18:09.720 --> 18:13.520
Oh, Dillinger's been playing a game I really want to play.

18:13.520 --> 18:14.520
Trauma Center New Blood.

18:14.520 --> 18:16.400
I need to go out and get that game.

18:16.400 --> 18:17.400
Yes you do.

18:17.400 --> 18:18.400
Trauma Center.

18:18.400 --> 18:19.400
I can take it from you and play it.

18:19.400 --> 18:20.400
No.

18:20.400 --> 18:21.400
Yes.

18:21.400 --> 18:22.400
My game.

18:22.400 --> 18:23.400
You can't take my game.

18:23.400 --> 18:24.400
Yeah, I can.

18:24.400 --> 18:25.400
Do you want to borrow something else on Wii?

18:25.400 --> 18:26.400
Sure.

18:26.400 --> 18:27.400
Like Metroid or something?

18:27.400 --> 18:28.400
I don't know.

18:28.400 --> 18:29.400
No.

18:29.400 --> 18:30.400
Not fucking Metroid.

18:30.400 --> 18:31.400
What?

18:31.400 --> 18:32.400
You sure it says Metroid on it.

18:32.400 --> 18:33.400
It says old school Metroid, damn it.

18:33.400 --> 18:38.080
I don't want to play no damn 3D Metroid, that blasphemous piece of crap.

18:38.080 --> 18:39.760
I mean, Metroid's great.

18:39.760 --> 18:43.240
AZHP says Trauma Center New Blood is the best game ever.

18:43.240 --> 18:44.240
Shut up.

18:44.240 --> 18:45.240
Interesting.

18:45.240 --> 18:47.240
I mean, it's okay that you said that, but I want to play it.

18:47.240 --> 18:50.240
I guess that's it for housekeeping.

18:50.240 --> 18:54.080
I don't have a lot else to add, so let's get into some, oh, actually one quick thing is

18:54.080 --> 18:57.600
that there's like a 90% chance next week, I know I've been saying this for a while now,

18:57.600 --> 19:02.240
but we'll finally be out in the actual studio for those keeping track.

19:02.240 --> 19:06.240
We've been in our temporary studio, quote unquote, for like the past three months, but

19:06.240 --> 19:10.400
I'm hoping next week, just due to some things that are going around in the personal life,

19:10.400 --> 19:13.000
we're going to try and get out there next week.

19:13.000 --> 19:16.080
I'm very excited about it, which is why I really want the cam to come back.

19:16.080 --> 19:22.040
So if Op11's not back next week, we're probably going to look into either Justin.tv or Ustream.

19:22.040 --> 19:27.160
I really haven't thought about what else is a good service, because I kind of liked how

19:27.160 --> 19:29.040
Op11 had the episodic stuff.

19:29.040 --> 19:31.640
But anyhow, let's get into gaming news.

19:31.640 --> 19:32.640
Loki.

19:32.640 --> 19:37.120
Anyways, the thing that everybody's been talking about this week is a certain GameStop editor

19:37.120 --> 19:42.800
was rumored to have been fired for a negative review over Kane and Lynch.

19:42.800 --> 19:51.320
Anyways, the person responsible for this, I can't remember his name, they just have

19:51.320 --> 19:56.920
his last name up here, anyways, and I don't even know how to pronounce that, Gershwin,

19:56.920 --> 19:57.920
I guess?

19:57.920 --> 20:01.880
I want to see if it's like a, anyways, Jeff Gershwin, yes.

20:01.880 --> 20:08.400
Anyways, so the rumor is, because no one's coming out to say otherwise, the rumor is

20:08.400 --> 20:13.900
this is because of his negative review on Kane and Lynch, Eidos threatened to pull the

20:13.900 --> 20:19.920
ad support, because they have the whole fucking site skinned like Kane and Lynch, and because

20:19.920 --> 20:27.440
of that, since the ads pay their salaries, basically, rather than lose them as a ad supporter,

20:27.440 --> 20:30.880
they fired him instead.

20:30.880 --> 20:36.920
And everybody is just up in arms, because now people have finally figured out, hey,

20:36.920 --> 20:45.560
guess what, maybe ad contributions from publishers and stuff affect scores of games.

20:45.560 --> 20:46.560
Really?

20:46.560 --> 20:47.560
You think?

20:47.560 --> 20:48.560
Hmm?

20:48.560 --> 20:49.560
You're kidding.

20:49.560 --> 20:51.440
Wow, welcome to the real world, folks.

20:51.440 --> 20:57.120
Anyways, so yeah, tons of stuff, in fact, I think there were some other people that

20:57.120 --> 21:01.080
also got fired too, at least there's one other person I know that got fired and I think other

21:01.080 --> 21:06.160
people are talking about leaving, but yeah, it's a big mess right now.

21:06.160 --> 21:15.840
Hmm, okay, you know, can I be honest, this guy is, okay, I'll lie, I've totally known

21:15.840 --> 21:19.520
about this guy and followed his career for a long, long time, is that a good lie?

21:19.520 --> 21:20.520
No.

21:20.520 --> 21:24.680
Okay, here's the truth, I had no idea who the hell this guy was until I read this article

21:24.680 --> 21:27.680
on the internet, apparently he's been some respected game journalist for the past ten

21:27.680 --> 21:34.160
years, but honestly, I don't read a lot of corporate sites, so I don't, there's a lot

21:34.160 --> 21:38.200
of independent blogs I read and maybe some of them are somewhat corporate because I read

21:38.200 --> 21:42.920
Joystiq, they're AOL, Kotaku, whatever, but I don't really read a lot of the big box sites

21:42.920 --> 21:43.920
very often.

21:43.920 --> 21:46.720
I used to read one up maybe like three years ago, I don't really read them a lot anymore

21:46.720 --> 21:50.600
either, so I had no idea who the hell this guy was.

21:50.600 --> 21:55.200
Nevertheless, I can't help but think, so I'm trying to look at this as objectively as possible

21:55.200 --> 21:59.840
because I can't help but think, and this may not be the popular opinion, but I actually

21:59.840 --> 22:03.060
think there's a bit of mob mentality going on here.

22:03.060 --> 22:09.200
I think the gaming scene is jumping to a lot of conclusions with this stuff, when there's

22:09.200 --> 22:13.800
a lot of people that really can't talk about what's going on in this situation, and I think

22:13.800 --> 22:17.680
there's been quite a bit of jumping to conclusions and things that have probably gotten blown

22:17.680 --> 22:18.680
out of proportions.

22:18.680 --> 22:19.680
Oh yeah.

22:19.680 --> 22:23.360
And the interesting thing about it, I mean honestly, these companies involved are kind

22:23.360 --> 22:29.440
of screwed because of it, and it's kind of alarming, I think if anything, from this what

22:29.440 --> 22:36.960
we're learning is that the video game scene can be very sensationalist sometimes, in some

22:36.960 --> 22:37.960
regards.

22:37.960 --> 22:38.960
This isn't the first time this stuff's happened.

22:38.960 --> 22:39.960
Not really, no.

22:39.960 --> 22:46.160
I mean, first off, people give him crap anyways because he had that, you know, non-ten review

22:46.160 --> 22:47.600
on Twilight Princess.

22:47.600 --> 22:51.920
Listen, if I were to review Twilight Princess, it wouldn't fucking get a ten, okay?

22:51.920 --> 22:56.700
Seriously, that game is not God's gift to fucking gaming, seriously, it's just a fucking

22:56.700 --> 23:00.960
Zelda game, just like Phantom Hourglass is a fucking Zelda game, they're good, but they're

23:00.960 --> 23:02.860
never great, okay?

23:02.860 --> 23:03.860
So whatever.

23:03.860 --> 23:06.000
I digress, but whatever, that's- Anyways.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
Everybody's allowed to have their own opinion, that's fine.

23:07.000 --> 23:11.240
I'm just saying, you know, everybody was fucking, like, giving Zelda a fucking blowjob or some

23:11.240 --> 23:14.160
shit like that, it is goddamn just a game.

23:14.160 --> 23:15.160
Anyways.

23:15.160 --> 23:18.480
I don't know, it kind of deserved at least a handjob, I mean it was a really good game.

23:18.480 --> 23:19.860
Oh absolutely, yeah.

23:19.860 --> 23:22.720
It was not that great of a game, seriously.

23:22.720 --> 23:24.080
Wind Waker is a better game.

23:24.080 --> 23:25.960
Whoa, that's crossing the line.

23:25.960 --> 23:28.520
Oh wow, yeah, no, you did not just go there.

23:28.520 --> 23:29.520
Ouch.

23:29.520 --> 23:30.520
Alright, back on topic.

23:30.520 --> 23:31.520
Anyways.

23:31.520 --> 23:33.880
I mean, does anyone remember Driver 3?

23:33.880 --> 23:37.720
How the whole story came out that people were, that Atari was paying for good reviews on

23:37.720 --> 23:38.720
that game?

23:38.720 --> 23:41.880
I mean, this isn't the first time, this isn't the last time this is going to happen, I'm

23:41.880 --> 23:48.680
sure it's happened hundreds of times between those, so I'm not surprised, it's just people

23:48.680 --> 23:53.640
are finally figuring it out, that this is going on behind the scenes.

23:53.640 --> 23:57.480
And to be honest, people don't really know why this guy was let go.

23:57.480 --> 24:01.540
I mean, think about it, just hypothetically, the company, and again, I don't know shit

24:01.540 --> 24:04.240
about what's going on in this situation, I'm not going to pretend like I know what's going

24:04.240 --> 24:07.480
on in this situation, I just know what I'm reading out there on the internet, what people

24:07.480 --> 24:13.260
were saying, and hypothetically, in the corporate world, they could have fired this guy because

24:13.260 --> 24:14.960
he was late to work too many times.

24:14.960 --> 24:15.960
Yep.

24:15.960 --> 24:16.960
Who knows?

24:16.960 --> 24:19.280
Okay, does it confirm that he was fired?

24:19.280 --> 24:20.280
He did not quit?

24:20.280 --> 24:21.280
He was laid off?

24:21.280 --> 24:24.120
Well, he was basically locked out of his office.

24:24.120 --> 24:30.900
But again, that's all talk, but you feel like there is some validity to that, because obviously

24:30.900 --> 24:36.520
employees of the company are stepping forward anonymously and saying these things, so he

24:36.520 --> 24:37.520
was fired.

24:37.520 --> 24:38.520
Okay.

24:38.520 --> 24:40.440
He'd been at the company for like 10 years.

24:40.440 --> 24:44.620
But anyhow, I've seen people in the corporate world work at a company for like 10, 15 years

24:44.620 --> 24:49.080
and get fired over a really bad thing or whatever goes on, so who knows?

24:49.080 --> 24:52.720
This guy could have been like late to work for an entire month or something.

24:52.720 --> 24:55.000
Again, I'm being very hypothetical.

24:55.000 --> 24:59.760
And the company could fire him, but the company can't say why they fired him.

24:59.760 --> 25:02.920
And if he gets fired over something like that, is he going to say, oh yeah, they fired me

25:02.920 --> 25:05.620
because I was late to work too many times?

25:05.620 --> 25:07.880
Or is he going to let people draw their own conclusions?

25:07.880 --> 25:13.200
He probably also can't, well, I'm not even really saying that, I think he can't actually

25:13.200 --> 25:15.520
say why he was fired.

25:15.520 --> 25:18.300
I think he has to sign something when he's leaving.

25:18.300 --> 25:21.080
This is why, you know, you're not allowed to say that.

25:21.080 --> 25:24.400
Okay, so he has to sign something or what?

25:24.400 --> 25:27.200
It's probably actually something he signed when he was, in confidentiality agreements

25:27.200 --> 25:30.840
he signed when he started with the company, not when he was leaving.

25:30.840 --> 25:34.400
Oh, sign this, you can't tell anyone why you're fired if we fire you.

25:34.400 --> 25:36.040
Well, I don't know.

25:36.040 --> 25:39.920
I think he can say why he's fired, he probably just didn't want to yet.

25:39.920 --> 25:41.200
I don't know.

25:41.200 --> 25:47.000
Well, I don't think he would purposefully do that because then they could, I don't know.

25:47.000 --> 25:50.600
It's not really slander, I guess, but...

25:50.600 --> 25:56.280
I'm pretty sure this is going on, I mean, it's just, sure it could be all these things,

25:56.280 --> 25:58.280
but it just smells a little fishy to me.

25:58.280 --> 26:02.500
The gut side of me says, I mean, where there's smoke there's fire, right?

26:02.500 --> 26:06.360
The gut side of me tells me there is some validity to this, and I think one theory I

26:06.360 --> 26:11.040
read somewhere that makes a lot of sense is that they wanted to change wording in the

26:11.040 --> 26:16.440
review to make it more accurate as to whatever would the change were between the Xbox 360

26:16.440 --> 26:22.880
and PlayStation 3 were, and he didn't want to do that, and he got let go for being somewhat

26:22.880 --> 26:27.640
of a difficult person on this and other issues in the past, and that, you know, because the

26:27.640 --> 26:31.880
wording got changed, the internet changed that into, you know, the great game of internet

26:31.880 --> 26:37.920
telephone, that got changed into, oh my gosh, he refused to change the article to give it

26:37.920 --> 26:40.360
a good score, so Eidos made them fire him.

26:40.360 --> 26:44.440
Okay, so why didn't they just not publish the review?

26:44.440 --> 26:48.400
Why didn't they just, like, say, hey, okay, well, this is not in line with what we're

26:48.400 --> 26:52.520
looking for, we're not going to publish it, I mean, I know he could just as easily go

26:52.520 --> 26:56.800
to his own personal blog and post it or whatever, but that's his own personal blog, they don't

26:56.800 --> 26:57.800
have jurisdiction on it.

26:57.800 --> 27:01.200
Well, the thing is, though, is they use a lot of these reviews as advertising for their

27:01.200 --> 27:02.200
game as well.

27:02.200 --> 27:05.960
I mean, that's why you see them boxes, you know, games where I gave it a five out of

27:05.960 --> 27:10.920
five or ten out of ten or whatever, you know, they use that shit in the fucking commercials,

27:10.920 --> 27:17.560
they use it in, you know, their press advertisements and all that stuff, it's a big deal for them

27:17.560 --> 27:23.560
if, you know, they're paying, you know, GameSpot, you know, like, say, a million dollars for,

27:23.560 --> 27:27.680
like, advertising or something like that, and then all of a sudden, they get a shitty

27:27.680 --> 27:32.800
ass review out of it and it causes people not to buy the game, what's going to incentivize

27:32.800 --> 27:36.160
them to give them more money when they can give it to some other site that's going to

27:36.160 --> 27:37.560
give it a more favorable review?

27:37.560 --> 27:42.560
Yeah, but if they don't publish it from that particular journalist, can't they just get

27:42.560 --> 27:45.240
one of their other journalists to publish a positive review?

27:45.240 --> 27:49.040
Yeah, but then it's going to come out that this guy had wrote a review on it and then

27:49.040 --> 27:53.400
all of a sudden, oh, wait a second, there's, you know, they didn't print it because this

27:53.400 --> 27:54.460
one's more favorable.

27:54.460 --> 27:57.480
It would come out one way or another.

27:57.480 --> 28:00.840
I just think that's a little far to be going, like, oh, we're going to fire you because

28:00.840 --> 28:01.840
you gave a bad review.

28:01.840 --> 28:05.360
And also, because they have deadlines, you know, when these reviews need to get out there,

28:05.360 --> 28:10.200
and they may not have time to, you know, it takes time to play through the game and be

28:10.200 --> 28:11.520
able to review it correctly.

28:11.520 --> 28:16.800
Granted, there are also rumors of people just writing reviews without playing the game.

28:16.800 --> 28:18.640
That happens too.

28:18.640 --> 28:23.840
Odd1 has a very interesting, and obviously our chat room is lit up with this, chat.orangehouseradio.com.

28:23.840 --> 28:28.500
Odd1 says, but seriously, who here was really looking forward to Kane and Lynch?

28:28.500 --> 28:30.480
Where the fuck was the hype for that recently?

28:30.480 --> 28:31.480
We're kind of swamped.

28:31.480 --> 28:34.720
I doubt even GameSpot's words could make it a million seller.

28:34.720 --> 28:39.600
Let's see, what else do we have here?

28:39.600 --> 28:42.520
Raven's Dolphin says, I heard he got fired of the video review.

28:42.520 --> 28:45.480
Well, maybe, but again, this is all hearsay.

28:45.480 --> 28:51.400
GZDr4ev says, people canceled their GameSpot accounts, yet people are leaving the site

28:51.400 --> 28:55.440
en masse over this whole thing, but again, I partially blame mob mentality for why that's

28:55.440 --> 28:59.160
happening because people don't really know what's going on yet, but people are making

28:59.160 --> 29:02.780
up stories that sure seem to make a lot of sense.

29:02.780 --> 29:06.720
Frisbee says, but if the game sucks, then the players will get the truth out there.

29:06.720 --> 29:07.720
Absolutely.

29:07.720 --> 29:09.920
Which I think just goes to show the lesson learned here.

29:09.920 --> 29:15.560
If you are getting all your gaming news and reviews from one person on one corporate gaming

29:15.560 --> 29:20.400
site, you might need to take off the blinders.

29:20.400 --> 29:24.560
If you're looking for accurate reviews on stuff, don't rely on one website.

29:24.560 --> 29:27.520
You can go to websites like Metacritic.

29:27.520 --> 29:33.600
They've got a compilation of scores from all sorts of sites and stuff, and that'll give

29:33.600 --> 29:40.640
you a good baseline of what the game is, and also you can read review and see what it is.

29:40.640 --> 29:41.640
Wait a minute.

29:41.640 --> 29:45.840
Did Metacritic pay you money for that low-key, for that endorsement?

29:45.840 --> 29:49.800
I just happened to use that site because it compiles reviews.

29:49.800 --> 29:50.800
Anyways.

29:50.800 --> 29:51.800
Fired!

29:51.800 --> 29:54.240
I don't get paid for shit, okay?

29:54.240 --> 29:55.240
Seriously.

29:55.240 --> 29:57.680
Yeah, you're right about that.

29:57.680 --> 30:02.920
The truth be told now, because at work we sell Kane & Lynch and stuff, and Kane & Lynch

30:02.920 --> 30:08.000
is one of those titles that was kind of a, what we call select style, it's a title we

30:08.000 --> 30:12.000
push because we're getting paid money to push the title a little bit.

30:12.000 --> 30:17.520
The thing is though, Eidos set our goal so high it was impossible to hit anyways so that

30:17.520 --> 30:22.720
it wouldn't have to pay out any money to us, because we had people that make these deals

30:22.720 --> 30:26.200
are fucking retarded or something.

30:26.200 --> 30:29.960
But yeah, they have a lot of, I mean, Eidos is really pushing to make this game big.

30:29.960 --> 30:34.720
I mean, doing it in little ways I probably wouldn't, you know, they're advertising, marketing

30:34.720 --> 30:39.920
people, little creative ways like, you know, teaming up with Playboy, for example, to do

30:39.920 --> 30:41.640
that model search.

30:41.640 --> 30:47.460
They had interviews with the fake characters in the game in Playboy.

30:47.460 --> 30:49.040
They did reach out to the independent media.

30:49.040 --> 30:52.400
They flew a bunch of them out there to San Francisco to go.

30:52.400 --> 30:55.440
We weren't invited, and we could just drive there, but that's okay.

30:55.440 --> 30:56.440
We're not bitter.

30:56.440 --> 30:57.440
Oh yeah, sure.

30:57.440 --> 31:02.240
You know, because we drive there, you know, that's why they don't invite us to this stuff.

31:02.240 --> 31:03.240
Bastards.

31:03.240 --> 31:05.240
Anyways, you know.

31:05.240 --> 31:10.520
But I also think there's definitely a certain type of audience I think this show caters

31:10.520 --> 31:11.520
to.

31:11.520 --> 31:15.000
I mean, granted, I think we have people from all walks of gaming that listen to this program,

31:15.000 --> 31:19.560
but I think people know that we are mostly the one you want to hear for the music, the

31:19.560 --> 31:20.560
RPGs.

31:20.560 --> 31:24.920
There's a certain niche that Kane & Lynch doesn't fit into, I think.

31:24.920 --> 31:26.760
Listen, I'm not saying Kane & Lynch is a bad game.

31:26.760 --> 31:28.240
It probably could have been a good game, but this...

31:28.240 --> 31:29.240
I've never played it.

31:29.240 --> 31:30.240
I don't know.

31:30.240 --> 31:32.800
I haven't played it either, but you know, just from whatever I've been reading and the

31:32.800 --> 31:39.360
way it looks, to me, this game's kind of fallen into the same problem that, you know, Black

31:39.360 --> 31:45.000
Sight Area 51 and some of these other games have gotten in their rush to make it out for

31:45.000 --> 31:46.000
Christmas.

31:46.000 --> 31:49.920
And this year, I think also next year, you're going to see a lot of these games that are

31:49.920 --> 31:53.560
going to be spread out throughout the year instead of all in November, and that might

31:53.560 --> 31:58.840
help some of these games, you know, because like Army of Two, for example, that one was

31:58.840 --> 32:04.480
going to be released in November as well along with Kane & Lynch and all this other stuff,

32:04.480 --> 32:05.520
but it wasn't done yet.

32:05.520 --> 32:09.880
And so instead of releasing it, they're putting more time into polishing it and making sure

32:09.880 --> 32:13.760
that it's a good game before they release it, and so now it's coming out later on.

32:13.760 --> 32:17.080
It missed, you know, the holiday thing, but it's going to be a better game.

32:17.080 --> 32:22.440
Same with like, you know, Grand Theft Auto IV, Metal Gear Solid IV, you know, stuff like

32:22.440 --> 32:23.440
that.

32:23.440 --> 32:27.280
Take the extra time and make the game good, and then that way you will get a better score

32:27.280 --> 32:33.920
for it instead of rushing this piece of shit out and then having to be broken.

32:33.920 --> 32:36.840
Here's the other thing that kind of makes me think there's more than meets the eye with

32:36.840 --> 32:38.000
this whole thing.

32:38.000 --> 32:41.120
Is a 6 out of 10 a bad review?

32:41.120 --> 32:45.160
I mean, I realize the way the scale has been kind of skewed over the years by many people,

32:45.160 --> 32:50.700
I guess yes, but I always thought a 5 was average, like right in the middle you're average,

32:50.700 --> 32:56.520
so a 5 is average, so technically a score of 6 is a slightly above average game.

32:56.520 --> 32:57.520
Right?

32:57.520 --> 32:58.520
True.

32:58.520 --> 33:01.680
And it wouldn't be that bad if it were in a month that was, you know, a bit slower with

33:01.680 --> 33:05.800
games, but this is November where you have, you know, 60 billion releases coming out,

33:05.800 --> 33:11.040
and a 6 game may not be played by as many people as, say, but here's what you need to

33:11.040 --> 33:12.040
do though.

33:12.040 --> 33:15.200
I'm not sure if the game's going to be good, I'm also just trying to take a jab at the

33:15.200 --> 33:18.760
fact that most games in this day and age are rated on a scale of 5 to 10, not a scale of

33:18.760 --> 33:19.760
1 to 10.

33:19.760 --> 33:20.760
7 to 10.

33:20.760 --> 33:26.520
No, but seriously though, if you're unsure the games can be good, rent it.

33:26.520 --> 33:32.320
I mean, rent it from Gamefly, rent it from your local Blockbuster, Hollywood, whoever,

33:32.320 --> 33:35.240
you know, rent it and see if it's any good.

33:35.240 --> 33:40.680
Shadowslier wants to give insight on that, he says, on the GameSpot scale a 6.0 is fair.

33:40.680 --> 33:46.040
Okay, but fair is not a bad word, it's not a good word either, it's just a fair word.

33:46.040 --> 33:49.720
There really is no better description for that.

33:49.720 --> 33:54.120
See, I don't even really like scale-based reviews in the first place, because then you

33:54.120 --> 33:58.320
just put all your trust, you're like having them make the decision for you.

33:58.320 --> 34:01.280
Like Loki said, just rent the game if you're so unsure about it.

34:01.280 --> 34:05.080
I mean, if it catches your eye in the first place, read the review, then go rent it, but

34:05.080 --> 34:07.440
if not, then I wouldn't even worry about it.

34:07.440 --> 34:09.200
Like, numbers are nothing.

34:09.200 --> 34:14.720
There are games that most of the critics out there on the internet have given fair scores

34:14.720 --> 34:19.160
to, such as I think Eternal Sonata was a game that got mostly sevens and stuff.

34:19.160 --> 34:21.160
I freaking love that game, that game was incredible.

34:21.160 --> 34:23.480
This is only one person's opinion on it.

34:23.480 --> 34:27.640
You're basing your entire, whether you're going to play this game or not, on one person's

34:27.640 --> 34:28.640
opinion.

34:28.640 --> 34:34.120
I mean, God, it's not like this was reviewed by a panel of scientists or something like

34:34.120 --> 34:38.240
that, where they had thousands of people playing this game and this is the score they came

34:38.240 --> 34:39.240
up with.

34:39.240 --> 34:42.880
It's one dude, whether he likes the game or not, he may just hate Eidos or something,

34:42.880 --> 34:47.120
they may have rubbed them the wrong way before, and now he's embittered and now it's a six

34:47.120 --> 34:49.880
or something because they fucking pissed him off.

34:49.880 --> 34:53.200
Or like, you know, if I reviewed Madden or something like that, I don't like fucking

34:53.200 --> 34:55.440
football games, one, or something like that.

34:55.440 --> 34:58.800
I mean, that's the kind of, you're supposed to be unbiased when you're playing this stuff,

34:58.800 --> 35:03.000
but you know, it's, what, I'm actually kind of curious, what do you think about the fact

35:03.000 --> 35:09.280
that, you know, after all this, the competitors down the street at 1UP did this little protest

35:09.280 --> 35:13.200
or something on their lunch, this whole, like, kind of, you know, having the signs Free Jeff

35:13.200 --> 35:14.680
and whatever all that stuff was.

35:14.680 --> 35:15.680
What do you think of that?

35:15.680 --> 35:17.960
Because I certainly have an opinion on it.

35:17.960 --> 35:20.040
Fucking attention whores is what that is.

35:20.040 --> 35:21.360
This is bullshit.

35:21.360 --> 35:22.360
Interesting.

35:22.360 --> 35:27.480
The same fucking shit's going on over at 1UP where most of the, you know, most of the internet

35:27.480 --> 35:31.040
would say the exact, what a great sign of support these guys are doing on their lunch

35:31.040 --> 35:32.040
break.

35:32.040 --> 35:33.360
This isn't going to support shit.

35:33.360 --> 35:37.680
All they're doing is just fucking, you know, oh, let's do this because, okay, if they were

35:37.680 --> 35:42.200
doing it genuinely and, you know, it was to support them, they wouldn't have put it in

35:42.200 --> 35:45.400
their fucking Flickr and then posted that shit everywhere.

35:45.400 --> 35:49.400
This is, you know, it's just like those fucking tobacco companies, oh, we donated a million

35:49.400 --> 35:53.840
dollars to this charity, praise us for doing some good.

35:53.840 --> 35:54.840
Fuck that.

35:54.840 --> 35:55.840
Interesting.

35:55.840 --> 35:58.800
You know, other people, if they noticed it or something like that and posted it in their

35:58.800 --> 36:02.880
fucking Flickr blogs, then it would be good, but the fact that they're, like, promoting

36:02.880 --> 36:05.360
themselves, look at what we did, we're so awesome.

36:05.360 --> 36:06.360
No, fuck that.

36:06.360 --> 36:07.360
I'm not, wow.

36:07.360 --> 36:10.280
Oh, we're going to get some angry e-mails this week.

36:10.280 --> 36:12.720
Mailbag at orangehonstroyer.com.

36:12.720 --> 36:16.720
Here's the thing is that I don't know what the motivation is, whatever, I'm not going

36:16.720 --> 36:21.640
to pretend to know, but I do think it was a little premature because, again, I find

36:21.640 --> 36:25.500
that a little strange that they would jump in on that mob mentality when none of us truly

36:25.500 --> 36:27.400
know what's going on.

36:27.400 --> 36:30.960
And they have waited until more news came out when, I mean, these guys do represent

36:30.960 --> 36:36.080
a corporation, so that's my only, like, I don't know if that was smart type of thing.

36:36.080 --> 36:39.680
Wait, so it was a bunch of employees from one up, like, during their lunch break.

36:39.680 --> 36:42.200
I think that there's reviewers and critics over there.

36:42.200 --> 36:43.200
Yeah.

36:43.200 --> 36:44.200
Yeah, Ziff Davis or whatever.

36:44.200 --> 36:45.200
During their lunch break?

36:45.200 --> 36:46.200
Oh, yeah, something like that.

36:46.200 --> 36:49.280
I mean, you can't control what somebody, that's right, they can do whatever the hell they

36:49.280 --> 36:50.280
want.

36:50.280 --> 36:53.600
But here's the thing, though, and I, what were they, you know, protesting that they

36:53.600 --> 36:58.520
support independent reviews or unbiased reviews or something like that, so what they're basically

36:58.520 --> 37:03.780
saying is that they support that so that one up has unbiased reviews.

37:03.780 --> 37:06.080
That's the impression that you're supposed to get from that.

37:06.080 --> 37:09.800
It's just fucking advertising for themselves is all it is.

37:09.800 --> 37:12.800
I'm sorry, I don't see it as very genuine at all.

37:12.800 --> 37:18.040
All I see that is is, hey, some manager came up with an idea to have them go out during

37:18.040 --> 37:21.040
their lunch break and fucking protest in front of them.

37:21.040 --> 37:25.080
No, I don't believe this shit, that they're such a tight-knit group or whatever, that

37:25.080 --> 37:26.600
they would do that kind of crap.

37:26.600 --> 37:30.800
But hold on, hold on, hold on, the few times we have been to these media events and things

37:30.800 --> 37:36.600
like that, it's always the same fucking people, so I think in some regard they are somewhat

37:36.600 --> 37:37.600
of a family.

37:37.600 --> 37:41.240
Okay, okay, let's say that they're a tight-knit group, okay, if I fucking got fired, say that

37:41.240 --> 37:45.440
we were corporate or whatever, and I got fired because, you know, I wrote a bad review on

37:45.440 --> 37:49.120
Kane and Lynch, would fucking one up be on my lawn protesting for that shit?

37:49.120 --> 37:53.080
No, they would be there twiddling their thumbs in their office going, ah, those fuckers that

37:53.080 --> 37:55.080
like DDR serves them right.

37:55.080 --> 37:57.940
I mean, seriously, that's the shit that would happen.

37:57.940 --> 38:02.000
This is not fucking, you know, advertising or anything like that.

38:02.000 --> 38:08.480
It's just, it, I'm sorry, I saw that, I'm like, oh, come on, seriously.

38:08.480 --> 38:12.480
And then I read it on every single blog, I got the same thing, oh, good one up, go them.

38:12.480 --> 38:16.400
I'm like, fuck that shit, I'm going there less now because of this.

38:16.400 --> 38:20.280
I'm going there less now, 25% less because of that, like.

38:20.280 --> 38:24.760
Yeah, let's see their, I bet you that fucking protest shit's in their goddamn EGM, too.

38:24.760 --> 38:30.480
How much you want to bet that shit is, oh, they're so, so independent and awesome that,

38:30.480 --> 38:31.480
you know, and unbiased.

38:31.480 --> 38:32.480
Let's put it in our magazine, too.

38:32.480 --> 38:33.480
Look how holy we are.

38:33.480 --> 38:36.880
You know, I just realized I have Tuesday off work.

38:36.880 --> 38:42.000
Maybe I should go down there with a sign that says, thank you for firing him.

38:42.000 --> 38:44.260
Orange Lounge Radio.

38:44.260 --> 38:46.920
Those fuckers who like DDR.

38:46.920 --> 38:47.920
Just to see what happens.

38:47.920 --> 38:48.920
No, I'm kidding.

38:48.920 --> 38:49.920
I have better things to do on Tuesday.

38:49.920 --> 38:50.920
No, you don't.

38:50.920 --> 38:51.920
Go down there.

38:51.920 --> 38:52.920
No, I'm going to see the Spice Girls.

38:52.920 --> 38:53.920
What are you talking about?

38:53.920 --> 38:54.920
You said you had better things to do.

38:54.920 --> 38:56.080
I have much better things to do on Tuesday.

38:56.080 --> 38:57.080
Whatever.

38:57.080 --> 39:00.760
Okay, let's just, you know, okay, the fact of the matter is, okay, we don't know why

39:00.760 --> 39:01.760
he was fired.

39:01.760 --> 39:03.120
We assume it's because of this.

39:03.120 --> 39:06.320
Yeah, this is going on in the industry, big whoop, you know, other things going on in

39:06.320 --> 39:07.320
the industry, too.

39:07.320 --> 39:12.960
Like, I don't know, certain media outlets getting to break street on certain news stories

39:12.960 --> 39:17.800
and stuff like that or no such embargo for them because, you know, they make a lot of

39:17.800 --> 39:19.440
money in advertising and that kind of thing.

39:19.440 --> 39:20.920
Yeah, that kind of stuff happens as well.

39:20.920 --> 39:24.480
There's a whole lot of shit you don't see that happens behind the scene, you know, day

39:24.480 --> 39:28.580
to day but, you know, we all deal with it and guess what, things aren't going to change

39:28.580 --> 39:30.280
so get over it.

39:30.280 --> 39:34.040
And really, in a month, who's going to be fucking talking about this?

39:34.040 --> 39:35.040
Who's going to give a shit?

39:35.040 --> 39:36.040
Nobody.

39:36.040 --> 39:38.680
If you want genuine reviews, ask someone that's actually played a damn game.

39:38.680 --> 39:39.680
Your friends.

39:39.680 --> 39:40.680
Irene, I don't know.

39:40.680 --> 39:44.840
I do think there is going to be some type of long lasting effect this whole thing has

39:44.840 --> 39:48.880
because I think people are going to, I think companies are going to watch what happens

39:48.880 --> 39:52.760
to the whole rah, rah, rah, my mentality, we hate you, GameSpot type thing that goes

39:52.760 --> 39:58.300
on and I think there's going to be a lot of, you're going to see, I think the big sites

39:58.300 --> 40:01.960
post about their integrity, like I think you're going to see the competitors like OneUp and

40:01.960 --> 40:06.280
IGM make things about their integrity in their reviews and their corporate policies.

40:06.280 --> 40:13.720
Well, wait a minute, let's revert back to an old situation that concerned, you know,

40:13.720 --> 40:18.840
mishandling or mistreatment of employees at a gaming establishment.

40:18.840 --> 40:21.760
Like look at, what was it, the EA spouse?

40:21.760 --> 40:24.040
How long did we talk about that?

40:24.040 --> 40:27.680
You know, the EA spouse that was like, oh, my husband's working too long or whatever

40:27.680 --> 40:29.480
lasted about a month.

40:29.480 --> 40:34.760
Yeah, they've raised issues of like, you know, oh, you know, look at them, they're evil and

40:34.760 --> 40:37.800
blah, blah, blah, blah, but people still go and work for them.

40:37.800 --> 40:39.280
People still buy their games.

40:39.280 --> 40:44.320
No one's really like EA did not go under as a company, like no one gives a shit anymore.

40:44.320 --> 40:45.760
Like did they put a hit on her?

40:45.760 --> 40:49.160
I mean, I don't know because nobody talks about it anymore.

40:49.160 --> 40:50.160
How the fuck do I know?

40:50.160 --> 40:51.160
No, I think I remember seeing it.

40:51.160 --> 40:52.160
I know I'm just teasing obviously.

40:52.160 --> 40:56.000
I think I remember seeing a story like a year ago, like she was unmasked and we found out

40:56.000 --> 40:58.240
who she really was and all this stuff.

40:58.240 --> 41:02.600
Also writing reviews and then the companies can start paying me because I need money.

41:02.600 --> 41:07.640
No, but seriously, though, I mean, if I had the free time, I'd write reviews, but I don't

41:07.640 --> 41:08.640
have the fucking free time.

41:08.640 --> 41:12.840
I have to work and then have a wife that I want to go home and a cat that wants me to

41:12.840 --> 41:13.840
play with it.

41:13.840 --> 41:16.960
So, you know, I have to do these things.

41:16.960 --> 41:17.960
I can't write reviews.

41:17.960 --> 41:21.200
Do you want me to put a hit out on your cat?

41:21.200 --> 41:22.200
Maybe my wife, but.

41:22.200 --> 41:23.200
Are you like?

41:23.200 --> 41:24.200
Wow.

41:24.200 --> 41:25.200
Wow.

41:25.200 --> 41:26.200
That was mean.

41:26.200 --> 41:27.200
Dang.

41:27.200 --> 41:28.200
Oh, snap.

41:28.200 --> 41:29.200
Is that Freudian?

41:29.200 --> 41:30.200
Was that intentional?

41:30.200 --> 41:34.120
I'm using opinions expressed on this program.

41:34.120 --> 41:35.840
Let's see.

41:35.840 --> 41:38.200
The chat room has been lining up and I've been ignoring them.

41:38.200 --> 41:39.200
Sorry, guys.

41:39.200 --> 41:41.560
Odd One says, I don't know, did I already read this one?

41:41.560 --> 41:42.880
I think, I don't think I did.

41:42.880 --> 41:46.400
I think the developers give the gaming press more credit than they're worth, especially

41:46.400 --> 41:47.760
in the face of the internet.

41:47.760 --> 41:48.760
The word gets out.

41:48.760 --> 41:49.760
We have our ears to the ground.

41:49.760 --> 41:53.960
Yes, you can get exclusive news from the corporate sites, but the message boards, podcasts and

41:53.960 --> 41:55.580
indie sites are where it's at.

41:55.580 --> 42:00.120
If Eidos was stupid enough to push this, seriously, I'd love to see them burn.

42:00.120 --> 42:04.520
I have a feeling actually, I have kind of a strange feeling, Eidos has nothing to do

42:04.520 --> 42:05.520
with this.

42:05.520 --> 42:08.440
I think maybe they were like, they were probably a little pissed and they probably let GameSpot

42:08.440 --> 42:12.320
know that, but you know, they also probably kind of realized that there wasn't a lot they

42:12.320 --> 42:13.320
could do about it.

42:13.320 --> 42:14.320
So, I don't know.

42:14.320 --> 42:18.400
I have a feeling if anybody's probably getting a bad rap over this, actually probably them.

42:18.400 --> 42:19.400
I don't know.

42:19.400 --> 42:21.400
It's just kind of one of my gut tells me about this whole mom mentality thing.

42:21.400 --> 42:22.600
Yeah, I don't think they had much to do with it.

42:22.600 --> 42:25.600
I don't think they can directly say, fire this person.

42:25.600 --> 42:30.720
I mean, if it was EA maybe, you know, maybe, but I mean, we're talking Eidos here, what,

42:30.720 --> 42:33.240
Tomb Raider, Hitman.

42:33.240 --> 42:34.240
That's it.

42:34.240 --> 42:35.240
I mean, seriously.

42:35.240 --> 42:39.520
Gerardimo says, dear world, go get your own opinion and decide if the game is good or

42:39.520 --> 42:41.020
not yourself.

42:41.020 --> 42:44.880
Mac Man says, I like the idea from All Games Interactive, sound effect reviews.

42:44.880 --> 42:49.000
Okay, this game is audience laughter out of Mario Jump.

42:49.000 --> 42:52.360
That's brilliant.

42:52.360 --> 42:53.520
Let's see.

42:53.520 --> 42:57.480
Tiger Claw in response to the 1UP protest says, maybe it's a sign that 1UP would like

42:57.480 --> 42:58.880
Gertzmann to work for them.

42:58.880 --> 42:59.880
Who knows?

42:59.880 --> 43:02.480
Odd1 says, Ziff is all about the publicity.

43:02.480 --> 43:03.840
They're good with Flickr and all that shit.

43:03.840 --> 43:07.320
I'm not surprised they videotape almost everything they do.

43:07.320 --> 43:10.360
Let's see.

43:10.360 --> 43:15.600
Yeah, I don't see Eidos pressuring them to fire this guy.

43:15.600 --> 43:19.560
I mean, EA or something, like if they gave Madden like a really shitty score or something

43:19.560 --> 43:23.800
like that, because they're a big company and have a lot of money to throw around, but...

43:23.800 --> 43:29.680
Eidos, I mean, what, would they have come out recently, Tomb Raider Anniversary Edition?

43:29.680 --> 43:30.680
I mean...

43:30.680 --> 43:33.240
All right, well, we've spent a lot of time talking about this topic.

43:33.240 --> 43:37.600
We want to move on to some other news, but I'm sure we'll hear a lot about this on the

43:37.600 --> 43:42.560
Skype line later, and of course, there always is our mailbag at orangeonsradio.com.

43:42.560 --> 43:47.240
Meanwhile, more news, and let's talk about the Virtual Console on the Wii.

43:47.240 --> 43:49.480
We'll start off with some Wii news tonight.

43:49.480 --> 43:50.600
This is great news.

43:50.600 --> 43:55.960
This makes me think Nintendo finally gets it, what we really want, in a way.

43:55.960 --> 44:01.120
Pokemon Snap is coming out on the Wii's Virtual Console in Japan, and usually this would be

44:01.120 --> 44:07.280
no big deal, however, the pictures that you take inside the game, you can now post to

44:07.280 --> 44:11.040
your Wii message board and send around on the address book.

44:11.040 --> 44:15.040
So if you've taken a picture of Pikachu doing a little dance or something, and you think

44:15.040 --> 44:20.240
it's really cute, I could send that over to the Wii that Rice Princess has and make her

44:20.240 --> 44:21.240
look at it.

44:21.240 --> 44:22.240
No, you won't.

44:22.240 --> 44:23.240
I just might.

44:23.240 --> 44:24.240
I'll just delete it.

44:24.240 --> 44:25.840
I'll befriend you, if that's possible.

44:25.840 --> 44:30.760
Now, I think a lot of us have been shouting for the mountaintops for years, well, at least

44:30.760 --> 44:32.320
years, since the Wii came out.

44:32.320 --> 44:38.420
We want to see additional functionality in the Virtual Console games, like online play

44:38.420 --> 44:39.740
and things like this.

44:39.740 --> 44:43.520
So the fact that they've done this for Pokemon Snap shows that it's possible, right?

44:43.520 --> 44:46.400
Why did they have to do it with Pokemon Snap?

44:46.400 --> 44:49.320
God damn it, why couldn't they pick a better game to do it with?

44:49.320 --> 44:52.000
Like nobody gives a shit about taking pictures of stupid Pokemon.

44:52.000 --> 44:54.960
Hey, I love Pokemon Snap, shut up.

44:54.960 --> 44:58.600
Yeah, well, it's stupid, and you're stupid.

44:58.600 --> 45:07.160
Anyways, Odd1 says, message board posts of Pokemon in near sexual positions up 500%.

45:07.160 --> 45:09.400
Pokemon Snap has now become Pokemon Slash.

45:09.400 --> 45:12.480
Good job, everybody.

45:12.480 --> 45:15.880
Of course they're making a lot of money off of Pokemon Snap and other Virtual Console

45:15.880 --> 45:16.880
titles.

45:16.880 --> 45:22.900
Nintendo estimates that they've made $33 million on the Virtual Console alone, and that kind

45:22.900 --> 45:27.960
of includes 7.8 million downloads across the service.

45:27.960 --> 45:28.960
Wow.

45:28.960 --> 45:30.440
Lots of money.

45:30.440 --> 45:32.360
And it's free money, essentially.

45:32.360 --> 45:35.440
I can't imagine the Virtual Console takes that much work.

45:35.440 --> 45:36.440
All that bandwidth.

45:36.440 --> 45:42.000
Well, it's not just that, but obviously they kind of have rewritten all the manuals in

45:42.000 --> 45:45.320
the Wii, because the Wii thing has their own manuals and stuff, and I'm sure they still

45:45.320 --> 45:47.760
have to do QA on all the games and what have you.

45:47.760 --> 45:51.360
So it's not like they do it completely free, but it's certainly much cheaper than making

45:51.360 --> 45:53.360
a new game.

45:53.360 --> 46:00.640
So this is probably very high cost efficiency type thing, cost gains, whatever they call

46:00.640 --> 46:01.640
that in the business world.

46:01.640 --> 46:04.360
Remember, they sell each one of those consoles at a profit.

46:04.360 --> 46:11.160
All right, well, speaking of the Virtual Console, some more titles coming out have been spoiled

46:11.160 --> 46:15.560
by the one and only ESRB, so you can expect in the near future, Top Hunter for the Neo

46:15.560 --> 46:21.040
Geo, Puyo Puyo 2 for the Genesis, King of Fighters 94 on the Neo Geo, Baseball Stars

46:21.040 --> 46:25.720
2, Bases Loaded on the NES, that game was pretty awesome, actually, the Dynastic Hero

46:25.720 --> 46:30.160
on the Turbografx-16, and Power Golf on the Neo Geo as well.

46:30.160 --> 46:31.160
Wow.

46:31.160 --> 46:34.120
All must be making their way sometime in the near future.

46:34.120 --> 46:37.380
Also just wanted to say really quickly that it's also been spoiled that on the Japanese

46:37.380 --> 46:42.560
Virtual Console, they'll be getting Treasure Hunter G, which is a game I vaguely remember.

46:42.560 --> 46:46.400
Why aren't they releasing better titles?

46:46.400 --> 46:47.400
I don't understand.

46:47.400 --> 46:51.360
Well, Treasure Hunter G was actually a pretty awesome RPG 16-bit.

46:51.360 --> 46:54.040
It kind of reminiscent of Final Fantasy VI a little bit.

46:54.040 --> 46:57.400
That's pretty cool, but I mean, the other games, like fucking Power Golf, who the hell

46:57.400 --> 46:58.400
played that?

46:58.400 --> 47:02.200
Bases Loaded, whatever, that's an okay game, I guess.

47:02.200 --> 47:06.680
Bases Loaded was kind of cool, but Baseball Stars was better on the NES.

47:06.680 --> 47:07.680
I like that game.

47:07.680 --> 47:11.880
I didn't play any baseball games on the NES, because I don't care about sports games.

47:11.880 --> 47:12.880
You know what's weird?

47:12.880 --> 47:16.940
Usually I'm not into sports games either, but I liked, here's the thing, I liked sports

47:16.940 --> 47:19.680
games a lot when they were simple.

47:19.680 --> 47:21.560
That's why I loved NBA Jam so much.

47:21.560 --> 47:26.160
I mean, that game was relatively, I mean that game was kind of made for, you know, dummies

47:26.160 --> 47:29.920
who can't really play basketball, but enjoy to watch it, you know?

47:29.920 --> 47:31.440
That's why I liked NBA Jam.

47:31.440 --> 47:40.200
Anyhow, anyways, in Japan, the Everybody's Nintendo Wii Channel has been launched, and

47:40.200 --> 47:44.000
of course, for those who may not know, it's a brand new channel that offers all sorts

47:44.000 --> 47:50.480
of things, including release dates, promotional videos, and DS demos that you can stream to

47:50.480 --> 47:52.200
your DS.

47:52.200 --> 47:56.880
So that's actually pretty cool, and it will allow you to view commercials, gameplay footage,

47:56.880 --> 48:03.480
they'll have interviews about various Nintendo products, box art, release schedules for the

48:03.480 --> 48:06.600
DS and the Wii, and other fun stuff.

48:06.600 --> 48:11.040
And hopefully soon, demos for Wii games as well.

48:11.040 --> 48:16.920
But right now they've got some different touch generation title demos, and of course the

48:16.920 --> 48:20.640
Japanese versions of Pokemon Diamond and Pearl.

48:20.640 --> 48:24.160
Now this seems like a very natural thing that Nintendo probably should have had a while

48:24.160 --> 48:25.160
ago.

48:25.160 --> 48:26.960
Do you have a word on when we might get this in the US at all?

48:26.960 --> 48:30.120
Fuck if I know, but this is something they were promising, what, before the Wii ever

48:30.120 --> 48:31.120
came out?

48:31.120 --> 48:32.120
Mm-hmm.

48:32.120 --> 48:35.640
Well, I don't know if they were ever necessarily promising it, but I think a lot of people

48:35.640 --> 48:41.460
kind of inferred that, hey, the DS has Wi-Fi in it, hey, so does your Wii, hmm, could the

48:41.460 --> 48:43.300
Wii interface with the DS later?

48:43.300 --> 48:46.040
And then, you know, you saw games like the Pokemon Stadium or whatever that game was.

48:46.040 --> 48:48.400
What ever happened to my new content every fucking day?

48:48.400 --> 48:50.080
Wii Connect 24, come on.

48:50.080 --> 48:53.920
Well, you get new weather reports every day, don't you?

48:53.920 --> 48:54.920
Granted you might be looking-

48:54.920 --> 48:56.760
No, because I have Wii Connect 24 turned off.

48:56.760 --> 49:00.640
You're looking at your Wii at 5 o'clock at night, and you see the weather from midnight

49:00.640 --> 49:01.640
that morning, but-

49:01.640 --> 49:04.840
Wii Connect 24 doesn't like my mod chip.

49:04.840 --> 49:05.840
Wow-s.

49:05.840 --> 49:10.040
All right, let's see.

49:10.040 --> 49:15.400
Mac Man says, everybody's Nintendo channel in America, now Nintendo, kill the chibi motherfucking

49:15.400 --> 49:19.280
robo team and get to work on it.

49:19.280 --> 49:21.040
That's an order from Mac Man in chat.

49:21.040 --> 49:23.320
Yeah, stop making chibi robo games, they suck.

49:23.320 --> 49:25.200
That's right, just knock it off.

49:25.200 --> 49:28.400
We're not saying fire those guys, just put them to work elsewhere.

49:28.400 --> 49:30.920
I'm saying fire those guys.

49:30.920 --> 49:35.960
Anyhow, you might have heard earlier in the show I mentioned that I was a fan of the game

49:35.960 --> 49:39.000
Eternal Sonata that came out a little earlier this year.

49:39.000 --> 49:44.760
Trycrescendo was the folks that made, Crescendo made this game, and they're now working on

49:44.760 --> 49:50.040
a new game called Fragile, and it's a new RPG that's going to be coming out for the

49:50.040 --> 49:53.520
Nintendo Wii, which is a system that Eternal Sonata was not on.

49:53.520 --> 49:58.000
It's on 360 and going to be coming out on PS3, but Fragile is going to be coming out

49:58.000 --> 49:59.740
on the Nintendo Wii.

49:59.740 --> 50:05.360
All we know so far is that the main character is a guy named Set, and you explore various

50:05.360 --> 50:06.360
cities.

50:06.360 --> 50:09.800
It takes place in a post-apocalyptic world.

50:09.800 --> 50:18.640
Most of the details at this time are in Japanese, but there is an official website up at fragile.namco-ch.net.

50:18.640 --> 50:22.800
There's also a little teaser trailer out there on the internet for the game, and I'm sure

50:22.800 --> 50:26.400
a lot of people are kind of excited about this because, you know, obviously the first

50:26.400 --> 50:31.760
generation of Wii games felt like ported PlayStation 2 games with motion control, so these type

50:31.760 --> 50:34.760
of game announcements get people excited for what the Wii can really do.

50:34.760 --> 50:39.680
Cool, and that reminds me, there's another game that's going to be coming out here,

50:39.680 --> 50:46.240
Opuna, that came out in Japan, I believe, and it's coming out over here in like February,

50:46.240 --> 50:49.760
I want to say, I'm going to check out the Japanese version next week, hopefully, too.

50:49.760 --> 50:52.880
Although I don't really know how much I'm going to be able to play out of those games,

50:52.880 --> 50:56.360
especially role-playing games, because they're all in Japanese, and I speak no Japanese,

50:56.360 --> 50:58.920
or at least very little Japanese.

50:58.920 --> 51:05.160
Anyways, the Nintendo DS in the UK has set some new sales records.

51:05.160 --> 51:13.880
They have sold 191,000 units in the UK, and that's more than any other hardware format

51:13.880 --> 51:21.480
has achieved in a seven-day period, so that's a pretty good week for them, I guess.

51:21.480 --> 51:27.280
The previous record was held by the PSP during its launch in September of 05, where it sold

51:27.280 --> 51:29.280
185,000 units.

51:29.280 --> 51:36.080
Alrighty, how about we start looking at some release dates, travel the world, and look

51:36.080 --> 51:41.120
at games that you can pick up in the UK right now if you think another game should be selling

51:41.120 --> 51:42.120
a lot of units.

51:42.120 --> 51:46.200
But first, before we get into release dates, one thing we promised a few weeks ago on the

51:46.200 --> 51:52.600
show is that we would be tracking sales numbers, because we have ways of getting the MPD sales

51:52.600 --> 51:58.320
numbers, and obviously, one game you guys want to know the sales on is Eye of Judgment,

51:58.320 --> 51:59.960
and that's because of the bet.

51:59.960 --> 52:04.220
If you recall, a bet was made on this program that Eye of Judgment, as Loki said, would

52:04.220 --> 52:08.080
no way in hell sell a million copies within six months of release.

52:08.080 --> 52:14.040
In fact, if the game manages to sell one million copies in six months within its release, Loki

52:14.040 --> 52:19.560
has said he will dress up in a tingle outfit and dance around in the garage, setting an

52:19.560 --> 52:27.480
Eye of Judgment on fire while playing a game versus Bobby Blackwolf, all on video for YouTube

52:27.480 --> 52:29.160
for years to come.

52:29.160 --> 52:33.160
However, we have to get the game to sell a million units first, and we have an update

52:33.160 --> 52:34.160
on the numbers.

52:34.160 --> 52:36.360
Loki, how many units are we there?

52:36.360 --> 52:37.360
Are we there yet?

52:37.360 --> 52:42.880
At least in the US, we're up to 17,600 units.

52:42.880 --> 52:47.760
But I will have you know, though, that's just from launch to December 3rd.

52:47.760 --> 52:49.120
I haven't gotten the new numbers yet.

52:49.120 --> 52:51.920
Hopefully, in the next couple of weeks, I'll have new numbers for us.

52:51.920 --> 52:54.800
So that's about within the first three weeks of release?

52:54.800 --> 52:55.800
Like two or three, yeah.

52:55.800 --> 52:56.800
All right.

52:56.800 --> 52:59.880
So we're 1.7% of the way there.

52:59.880 --> 53:01.320
Yay!

53:01.320 --> 53:02.320
Making good progress.

53:02.320 --> 53:03.660
Keep at it, guys.

53:03.660 --> 53:06.800
Good luck to you.

53:06.800 --> 53:09.520
I'm looking at the chat room to see what's going on.

53:09.520 --> 53:12.440
Dark Tetsuya says, that's it?

53:12.440 --> 53:15.600
Sorry, folks.

53:15.600 --> 53:20.720
I wish I had better news for you, but that's it so far.

53:20.720 --> 53:22.280
All right.

53:22.280 --> 53:24.240
Anyhow, let's look at the release dates.

53:24.240 --> 53:28.400
We'll start off in Europe since the last story was about Europe, and coming out on the seventh

53:28.400 --> 53:34.400
in Europe, Alvin and the Chipmunks, the movie game tie-in on the DS, PC, and Wii.

53:34.400 --> 53:39.780
Game movie tie-ins, Beowulf comes out on the PSP, also Brother in Arms, Road to Hill 30

53:39.780 --> 53:45.720
comes out on the Wii, Disgaea makes its way to the PSP, Dragon Blade Wrath of Fire comes

53:45.720 --> 53:51.920
out on the Wii, Juiced 2 on the PC, hey, hey, Link's Crossbow Training comes out on the

53:51.920 --> 53:56.280
Nintendo Wii, Myst comes out on the DS.

53:56.280 --> 53:59.560
I forgot that they were remaking the old Myst games on DS.

53:59.560 --> 54:01.560
That's what this is, right?

54:01.560 --> 54:02.560
That's pretty rad.

54:02.560 --> 54:03.880
Is that out here in the US?

54:03.880 --> 54:06.760
I don't think on the DS, but I know it's on the PSP.

54:06.760 --> 54:10.840
Pokemon Battle Revolution finally comes out on the Wii, over in Europe this week, Pro

54:10.840 --> 54:17.200
Evo Soccer 2008 on the DS, also this week on the seventh, Sing Star PlayStation 3 finally

54:17.200 --> 54:22.920
this week on the seventh, SOCOM on the PSP, Soldier of Fortune Payback on the 360 on the

54:22.920 --> 54:28.960
PC, Sonic Rivals 2 on the PSP, couple ports of the Golden Compass on PBS and PC, Tomb

54:28.960 --> 54:33.080
Raider Anniversary makes its way to the Wii, and Ultimate Mortal Kombat on the DS, and

54:33.080 --> 54:37.360
PlayStation 3 isn't left out, Uncharted, Drake's Fortune comes out.

54:37.360 --> 54:41.080
And if you're looking for something a little more casual, something mom can get into, Who

54:41.080 --> 54:44.240
Wants to Be a Millionaire comes out on the Wii this week.

54:44.240 --> 54:47.000
No word yet if Meredith Vieira stars or not.

54:47.000 --> 54:48.000
Okay.

54:48.000 --> 54:50.720
In the US, we have Alvin and the Chipmunks.

54:50.720 --> 54:53.280
Actually she wouldn't, because those are the Europe release dates, and they have a different

54:53.280 --> 54:57.200
host over there, so I look stupid.

54:57.200 --> 55:02.740
In the US, Alvin and the Chipmunks coming out on PC, DS, PlayStation 2, and I believe

55:02.740 --> 55:05.520
the Wii.

55:05.520 --> 55:11.720
American Girl, Julie Finds Away, with I must say the most creepy cover for a game I have

55:11.720 --> 55:14.320
ever seen, this crazy chick.

55:14.320 --> 55:15.320
What the hell?

55:15.320 --> 55:16.320
I don't know.

55:16.320 --> 55:19.080
She's just kind of creepy looking.

55:19.080 --> 55:21.540
Wait, what the hell game is this?

55:21.540 --> 55:26.200
American Girl, Julie Finds Away, finds a way to pull the Doom Switch is the way it looks

55:26.200 --> 55:28.400
like here.

55:28.400 --> 55:34.520
It looks like Julie, like, you know how blind people use that white cane?

55:34.520 --> 55:35.760
That's kind of what it looks like to me.

55:35.760 --> 55:39.600
She looks like she's like rowing a gondola or something.

55:39.600 --> 55:42.720
Can you post that in chat so you can see that?

55:42.720 --> 55:45.800
She finds a way to make some money rowing a gondola.

55:45.800 --> 55:48.200
What is the game about?

55:48.200 --> 55:49.200
I don't know.

55:49.200 --> 55:50.200
I don't know.

55:50.200 --> 55:51.760
Who gives a shit?

55:51.760 --> 55:56.360
For those listening on the archive, seriously, look up this game in the box art, it's kind

55:56.360 --> 55:57.360
of scary.

55:57.360 --> 56:01.640
Anyways, the Golden Compass is coming out this week as well and that's on Playstation

56:01.640 --> 56:08.840
2, Playstation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and PSP, probably did DS as well.

56:08.840 --> 56:16.480
Let's see, Dragon Ball Z Budokai Tenkaichi 3 on the Wii, it's coming out as well.

56:16.480 --> 56:20.760
Draglade on the DS, which is supposed to be a pretty good game, I think that's sort of

56:20.760 --> 56:23.440
a music game too, actually.

56:23.440 --> 56:30.480
A small little game here called Dance Dance Revolution Universe 2, the bundle only is

56:30.480 --> 56:34.120
coming out this week.

56:34.120 --> 56:36.080
Universe at War, Earth Assault.

56:36.080 --> 56:38.520
When does the game itself come out?

56:38.520 --> 56:39.520
Do we know?

56:39.520 --> 56:40.520
January.

56:40.520 --> 56:42.640
You want to hear something even weirder?

56:42.640 --> 56:47.280
DDR Caught as a Party, the game only version, it's not coming out until April now.

56:47.280 --> 56:53.000
What the fuck, I mean seriously, the game is out right now in a bundle, but for some

56:53.000 --> 56:55.960
reason cannot release the game by itself until April.

56:55.960 --> 56:56.960
Nope.

56:56.960 --> 56:58.920
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

56:58.920 --> 57:00.420
Anyways, Yu-Gi-Oh!

57:00.420 --> 57:11.800
World Championship 2008 on the DS, let's see here, I know this week is pretty light, Left

57:11.800 --> 57:15.280
Behind Eternal Forces expansion pack is coming out this week.

57:15.280 --> 57:19.920
Godzilla Unleashed on the Wii, which I'm sure is wonderful.

57:19.920 --> 57:29.000
Strawberry Shortcake, the Four Seasons cake on the DS.

57:29.000 --> 57:35.120
Jenga on the Wii, absolutely the best idea for a game ever.

57:35.120 --> 57:36.440
Jenga?

57:36.440 --> 57:40.540
It's $30, folks, that's actually more than the actual game cost.

57:40.540 --> 57:45.920
What I want to know is are you still supposed to chant Jenga, Jenga, while someone's removing

57:45.920 --> 57:46.920
the block?

57:46.920 --> 57:50.080
Because you know you're supposed to do that in the regular game?

57:50.080 --> 57:51.080
Is that what it says in the rules?

57:51.080 --> 57:52.080
I don't know.

57:52.080 --> 57:57.240
It's something my friend told me when I was a kid, so it probably was made up, just to

57:57.240 --> 57:58.240
make me look stupid.

57:58.240 --> 58:03.480
Everyone's like, what the hell are you talking about, Rob, we don't do that.

58:03.480 --> 58:07.200
I believe that would be made up, Rob.

58:07.200 --> 58:10.720
Anyways, that's it.

58:10.720 --> 58:15.440
Then let's go over to Japan, where they get some games before we do, and one of the biggies

58:15.440 --> 58:19.920
is Lost Odyssey, making its way to the Xbox 360 on December 6th.

58:19.920 --> 58:26.280
Also on the Xbox 360 this week in Japan, Conan, as well as Virtua Fighter 5, which I know

58:26.280 --> 58:28.600
is one that people are looking forward to.

58:28.600 --> 58:32.880
A game that people are probably not looking forward to so much, Viva Pinata Party Animals,

58:32.880 --> 58:38.760
or as they call it, Atsumare, Viva Pinata, Let's Party, coming out on the Xbox 360.

58:38.760 --> 58:41.260
On the PlayStation 3, Conan as well.

58:41.260 --> 58:45.720
Also Pirates of the Caribbean, At World's End comes out on December 6th.

58:45.720 --> 58:50.720
Also Uncharted, Drake's Fortune, and a brand new USB headset, if you're into that.

58:50.720 --> 58:55.760
Also coming out on the Nintendo Wii, we have No More Heroes coming out on the 6th, as well

58:55.760 --> 59:01.120
as Rayman Raving Rabbids 2, or Rabbids Party Returns, is what the localized version is.

59:01.120 --> 59:04.280
Okay, did they really need to make a sequel to that shitty-ass game?

59:04.280 --> 59:05.960
Oh my god, that game was awful.

59:05.960 --> 59:07.640
Actually, I hear the second one is pretty good.

59:07.640 --> 59:08.640
It's pretty fun.

59:08.640 --> 59:09.640
It's probably not bad.

59:09.640 --> 59:11.680
Because they've taken over Earth.

59:11.680 --> 59:15.160
Namco's putting out a game called, or I'm sorry, Bandai, well, it's the same thing.

59:15.160 --> 59:20.760
Mina de Asubo de Namco Carnival comes out on the Wii, which I'm sure is just probably

59:20.760 --> 59:26.300
a collection of past games, or it might be, I don't know, this might be some type of like

59:26.300 --> 59:29.460
Mario Party game, but starring the Namco characters.

59:29.460 --> 59:36.880
I think that's actually the, what was it, the Namco collection that came out over here.

59:36.880 --> 59:40.240
Oh, okay, with the upgraded games and stuff?

59:40.240 --> 59:41.240
Yeah.

59:41.240 --> 59:42.240
That makes sense.

59:42.240 --> 59:49.400
Also coming out on the Wii from Sega, Doraemon Wii, Himitsu Dougo Ketai Sen is coming out.

59:49.400 --> 59:54.640
Also, wait for it, Disney Princess Enchanted Journey this week on the Wii.

59:54.640 --> 59:55.640
Yay!

59:55.640 --> 59:56.640
Yay!

59:56.640 --> 01:00:01.000
Also another Tamagotchi game, Tamagotchi no Furi Furi Kaje Kaiden comes out as well.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.720
I hope I want to play No More Heroes, that looks fun.

01:00:03.720 --> 01:00:07.240
On the PlayStation 2, lots of stuff as well, another version of Pirates of the Caribbean

01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:08.640
at World's End.

01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:13.280
Another Mahjong game, hurray, Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories finally comes out on

01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:18.480
the PlayStation 2, and another version of Disney Princess Enchanted Journey, as well

01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:20.720
as a game called Finalist.

01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:24.240
I think that's just a price reduction, though, it was already a game out there from Princess

01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:28.200
Soft, one of our favorite Japanese companies.

01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:29.200
Princess Soft?

01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:31.560
They put out a lot of games.

01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:36.040
Also on the Nintendo DS this week in Japan, Arkanoid DS, that's the one that comes with

01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:40.000
a little paddle that goes in the Game Boy band slot, that's kind of neat.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:46.600
Also coming out, we have Doko Demo Raku Raku DS Kaibou comes out, I don't know if that's

01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:52.940
a price reduction or what that is, but this is the thing though, you always kind of worry

01:00:52.940 --> 01:00:57.160
because they advertise on the box how cheap it is.

01:00:57.160 --> 01:00:58.160
So that's always...

01:00:58.160 --> 01:01:00.920
Very cheapo game!

01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:07.520
So K1 World GP comes out on the DS, and you want me to try to pronounce this one?

01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:10.760
This one's going to be kind of fun, here it is.

01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:21.240
Maru Kaitei Dondon Obaru Kyui no Sugawa Shiki Kanji Kyoku Jutsu Kaiso Gaku Shu-hen.

01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:24.000
It's a language learning program, which apparently I need.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:27.040
Yeah, you really do.

01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:32.920
I can special order this game from Japan, said it probably won't help me because it's

01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:38.200
probably for Japanese people to learn other languages, so I'll be screwed.

01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:44.900
Also on the DS, Tales of Innocence comes out, that's a Namco game, and wow, pretty big week

01:01:44.900 --> 01:01:46.740
in Japan I must say.

01:01:46.740 --> 01:01:50.320
But I guess they don't have the big shopping day like we do here, so they get games right

01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:52.280
up until Christmas.

01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:57.080
Coming out on PSP, another version of Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories, also Silent

01:01:57.080 --> 01:02:01.320
Hill Zero comes out, which was Silent Hill Origins here.

01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:08.320
Minano Golf Portable 2, that's just hotshots golf, comes out over there as well, and that's

01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:09.320
it.

01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:10.320
Awesome.

01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:20.480
Anyways, so this is actually pretty recent news, Activision and VinVidi have merged into

01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:25.880
one super company, Activision you'll know of course behind the such wonderful series

01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:32.560
as Call of Duty, Tony Hawk, and the lesser known Cabela's, and VinVidi of course behind

01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:39.440
such wonderful games as Spyro, Scarface, oh and a small little game called World of Warcraft,

01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:42.720
or they own Blizzard, which is behind World of Warcraft.

01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:50.080
Of course, this whole merger, you know, it's gonna be pretty good I'd say for both companies,

01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:53.240
but you know, millions of dollars here, actually billions of dollars.

01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:54.240
Bad for the gamers.

01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:55.240
No, I'm just kidding.

01:02:55.240 --> 01:02:56.240
I have no idea.

01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:57.240
18 billion dollar deal.

01:02:57.240 --> 01:02:58.240
Woo!

01:02:58.240 --> 01:02:59.240
That's a lot of money.

01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:00.240
That's a lot of money.

01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:03.000
So, I don't know.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.640
But the new company is called Activision Blizzard, yes?

01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:06.640
Yes.

01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:07.640
That's a little lame.

01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:08.640
I don't like the name.

01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:13.720
So is it gonna be like, Activision Blizzcon, is it gonna be like...

01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:18.240
I think you will see little things like that probably happen.

01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:21.800
Why can't they just call it Act of Avendi or whatever?

01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:25.560
Or just decide which company gets to keep its name.

01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:27.920
Or VivendiVision or something.

01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:32.440
I just hope this means we get the level 70 Tauren Chieftain Warrior Songs and Guitar

01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:33.440
Hero.

01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:35.440
You already made that joke earlier, Rob.

01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:36.440
When we weren't on air.

01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:39.320
Why don't they just call the company World of Warcraft?

01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:40.320
There you go.

01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:41.320
They should, yeah.

01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:42.320
There you go.

01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:46.400
World of Warcraft, World of Warcraft for World of Warcraft players.

01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:49.560
That's a great idea.

01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:52.080
That means now Activision is gonna have my bank account number.

01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:55.960
I don't know how I feel about that.

01:03:55.960 --> 01:04:02.200
All of a sudden you'll get, you know, soldiers coming in from Call of Duty 4.

01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:06.440
You know, Blizzard swears up and down this is not gonna have any effect on...

01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:07.440
I doubt it.

01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:08.440
I don't think it will either.

01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:09.440
Why would it?

01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:10.440
I mean...

01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:11.440
I don't know.

01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:12.440
But wouldn't that be interesting though?

01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:17.480
Does this happen when like, you know, Activision got Red Octane who had done Guitar Hero, right?

01:04:17.480 --> 01:04:19.800
Then Guitar Hero 3 went to Neversoft.

01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:22.080
Does this mean now that Activision...

01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:24.880
I mean, this is something I could seriously see happening.

01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:28.360
Does this mean now that Activision is another resource for companies such as Blizzard, does

01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:31.800
this mean that Activision could send off something that everybody's been waiting for?

01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:35.800
Like Starcraft Ghost somewhere else to be developed and finished?

01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:36.800
It's possible.

01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:39.280
That's the ramification I think could happen out of this.

01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:47.720
Or we could have such wonderful games as Project Gotham Racing World of Warcraft Edition where

01:04:47.720 --> 01:04:51.160
you're racing cars through World of Warcraft.

01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:54.800
Yes, because there's so many cars in World of War...

01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:55.800
Hey!

01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:56.800
Hey!

01:04:56.800 --> 01:04:57.800
Listen.

01:04:57.800 --> 01:04:58.800
Fictional tracks, okay?

01:04:58.800 --> 01:04:59.800
Come on.

01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:02.200
Obviously there's not real cars there, but they could have flying mounts.

01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:03.200
It would have to be...

01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:04.200
You could race your mounts.

01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:05.200
Project...

01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:07.360
Project Gotham Kodo Racing would work.

01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:08.360
Oh my god.

01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:12.480
That's terrible.

01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:17.720
That would be my guess on what's going to happen is that some of the Blizzard franchises

01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:19.720
that Blizzard has not had time to pay attention to...

01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:20.920
Guitar Hero is the new...

01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:24.480
Activision will make Diablo III.

01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:25.480
Somebody's going to do it.

01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:28.080
Guitar Hero is the new class in the next Warcraft.

01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:30.240
Oh, that would be awesome!

01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:31.240
Expansion.

01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:33.240
Being able to play instruments.

01:05:33.240 --> 01:05:34.240
Yeah.

01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:38.080
We could come up with tons of dumb ideas.

01:05:38.080 --> 01:05:42.640
Frisbee says, there's no tracks in World of Warcraft, in reference to that commercial

01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:44.800
from a little while ago.

01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:49.560
I want a game, though, that would be cool to have a role-playing game online that has

01:05:49.560 --> 01:05:53.620
a bunch of weird shit in it that makes no sense whatsoever, because I've never played

01:05:53.620 --> 01:05:54.620
a game like that.

01:05:54.620 --> 01:05:55.620
Exactly!

01:05:55.620 --> 01:06:02.400
But I'm talking absolutely crazy shit, where you can summon a giant jeep to come through

01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:05.720
and crush people, just for no apparent reason.

01:06:05.720 --> 01:06:06.720
Just crazy shit.

01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:07.720
Oh my god.

01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:11.240
And so are you proposing that you need to meet with the heads of Activision Blizzard

01:06:11.240 --> 01:06:13.920
to propose Loki's World of Randomness?

01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:18.760
Hey, I like the ring of that.

01:06:18.760 --> 01:06:19.880
I think I might buy that.

01:06:19.880 --> 01:06:24.280
Chat room, would you buy a game called Loki's World of Randomness?

01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:27.980
I'm going to attack you with my cat.

01:06:27.980 --> 01:06:28.980
Laser cats.

01:06:28.980 --> 01:06:29.980
Laser cats.

01:06:29.980 --> 01:06:32.640
We'll license laser cats.

01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:34.800
There you have it.

01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:37.080
Ten million right there.

01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:38.080
Jellybean attacks.

01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:42.080
Oh no, zap it with a laser cat.

01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:46.160
I summon the truck to run it over, never mind.

01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:48.520
Less QQ, more Mew Mew.

01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:50.800
That was awful.

01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:52.840
We should move on.

01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:56.440
The doctor says I would pay $300.

01:06:56.440 --> 01:07:02.560
Dark Tetsuya says do want.

01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:06.120
Dark Tetsuya gave you a LOL Irene for your less QQ, more Mew Mew.

01:07:06.120 --> 01:07:07.120
Yay.

01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:08.120
I like that.

01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:09.120
That was good.

01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:10.120
Good times.

01:07:10.120 --> 01:07:11.120
Alrighty.

01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:12.120
Sony.

01:07:12.120 --> 01:07:14.120
What the hell is that?

01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:17.760
Talking dolphins?

01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:21.720
It's unfortunately a reference to a book that sucks.

01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:28.280
Anyhow, Sony has decided to drop their ad agency of the past 13 years.

01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:30.960
Why did they decide to drop it now?

01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:37.240
Well, I'm guessing probably after what happened in hindsight of the whole PlayStation 3 debacle

01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:39.880
where the ads were not so hot.

01:07:39.880 --> 01:07:42.160
Well, that was like last year.

01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:43.160
I mean, come on.

01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:45.520
There's like, you know, we really should drop them.

01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:46.520
I mean, come on.

01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:47.840
It hasn't really done that well for us.

01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:49.080
Let's give it some more time.

01:07:49.080 --> 01:07:50.080
Come on.

01:07:50.080 --> 01:07:51.800
Well, maybe the people will turn around a year later.

01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:56.160
Maybe we should really drop them now because these ads have kind of sucked.

01:07:56.160 --> 01:07:57.160
Okay.

01:07:57.160 --> 01:08:05.080
So in reference, the ad agency was TBWA Chiade was the full name of the ad agency.

01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:10.200
And if you're wondering, does this affect both the U.S. and Europe, yes, it does.

01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:13.560
They were also the ones that created the whole black and white campaign.

01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:17.960
Remember that thing for the PSP that some people called racist and the other like circus

01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:20.620
to Soleil one they have going on.

01:08:20.620 --> 01:08:22.480
This has been kind of a long time coming.

01:08:22.480 --> 01:08:23.700
Oh my God.

01:08:23.700 --> 01:08:25.200
Some might say.

01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:29.920
Anyways, just in case you're worried that Grand Theft Auto might not be coming out pretty

01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:30.920
soon.

01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:32.500
Well, we still don't know when it's coming out.

01:08:32.500 --> 01:08:38.320
But they are starting to run some more videos and stuff for it, including a box art reveal

01:08:38.320 --> 01:08:45.480
trailer, which they elaborately painted a, you know, giant copy of the box art for Grand

01:08:45.480 --> 01:08:48.760
Theft Auto IV on a giant canvas painting.

01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:51.320
And it looks pretty awesome, but you know, your typical Grand Theft Auto.

01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:53.040
It's like every other Grand Theft Auto game I've ever seen.

01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:54.040
Yeah, your typical Grand Theft Auto one.

01:08:54.040 --> 01:08:58.000
Of course, people are dissecting to say, Oh my God, there's motorcycles and helicopters

01:08:58.000 --> 01:08:59.000
in the game.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:00.000
Oh, really?

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:01.000
Like every other game.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:05.600
Anyways, so I hope the giant air tram can be used as like a weapon or something.

01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:09.880
Yeah, I hope you can cut the cables to that thing.

01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:13.800
Oh, I wish anyways.

01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:18.480
But there's going to be a brand new trailer on December 6th, which is entitled Move Up

01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:21.480
Ladies.

01:09:21.480 --> 01:09:32.800
Next Thursday at 3 p.m. Eastern Time is when you can expect that trailer, when the internet

01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:33.800
explodes with it all over the place.

01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:37.440
Yeah, but you can expect to see it 24 hours later after the traffic dies down because

01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:40.480
you know their servers are going to get killed when the trailer comes out.

01:09:40.480 --> 01:09:46.480
Because like, didn't they say when the first one came out that it broke the internet?

01:09:46.480 --> 01:09:48.120
Yeah, something like that.

01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:51.560
But hey, that's good that they're showing trailers because that means that there's more

01:09:51.560 --> 01:09:53.280
work being done on it.

01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:56.640
At least that's what I'd like to assume.

01:09:56.640 --> 01:09:59.920
Some new details have come out for another game that's getting an anticipated sequel

01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:00.920
next year.

01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:05.780
Silent Hill 5 comes out next year and some new details have come out about the game.

01:10:05.780 --> 01:10:10.560
The flashlight and radio static is going to be returning to the game.

01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:13.420
Those kind of features didn't really exist in Silent Hill 4.

01:10:13.420 --> 01:10:16.800
But then again, that's not very surprising because Silent Hill 4 was not even originally

01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:20.320
going to be a Silent Hill game, so what have you.

01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:25.160
Light apparently is going to actually kind of have a pretty major function in this game.

01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:29.120
The enemies will respond based on whatever the light is doing.

01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:33.600
There's also going to be some puzzles that involve an x-ray viewer and nurses that you

01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:36.880
know are doing scary things.

01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:41.200
It sounds like the game of course is being greatly inspired by the Silent Hill movie

01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:43.240
but I don't think that's such a bad thing to be honest.

01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:44.920
I loved the movie.

01:10:44.920 --> 01:10:45.920
Here's the other biggest change.

01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:49.480
Silent Hill 5 will not have preset camera angles.

01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:50.480
Really?

01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:53.560
You will control the entire visuals.

01:10:53.560 --> 01:10:56.840
That's actually, I'm not sure how I feel about that.

01:10:56.840 --> 01:11:00.240
That could be a double edged sword there.

01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:03.760
And then the other thing that's kind of weird about it too is the damage system that they

01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:08.600
have in it now is going to be like Metal Gear Solid 3 where there's just not health power

01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:11.520
ups anymore to heal you.

01:11:11.520 --> 01:11:14.840
You have to like, I don't know.

01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:16.160
Kill a snake and eat it.

01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:19.080
Break a grenade open and like, you know.

01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:22.520
Silent Hill 5, break a grenade open and.

01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:25.480
Like Rambo style or something, I don't know.

01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:26.520
That's going to be interesting.

01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:31.700
Also there's supposed to be a mini game that has puzzles from like God of War which were

01:11:31.700 --> 01:11:34.560
like DDR-ish in a way, button tapping things.

01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:40.680
Oh god, like every other fucking game on earth now with the stupid context sensitive shit.

01:11:40.680 --> 01:11:43.600
Yes, but Konami made DDR so it's okay.

01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:48.720
Wait, it's not like DDR, it's just Shenmue did it first.

01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:49.720
Whatever.

01:11:49.720 --> 01:11:56.040
Anyways, Metal Gear Solid 4, according to the producer, must sell a million copies day

01:11:56.040 --> 01:12:00.920
one in order for them to make their money.

01:12:00.920 --> 01:12:07.440
So with that being released exclusively on the Playstation 3 right now, that's going

01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:09.640
to be pretty hard for them to do.

01:12:09.640 --> 01:12:13.080
I mean the Eye of Judgment could only sell 17,000 in the first three weeks.

01:12:13.080 --> 01:12:20.280
Let me put it this way, no Playstation 3 to date has sold a million copies day one.

01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:24.960
I don't know if any of them have sold a million copies at all.

01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:29.600
So I mean, granted, if there was going to be a game that's going to do that, I'd say

01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:31.960
Metal Gear Solid 4 would probably be it.

01:12:31.960 --> 01:12:34.760
Are we sure this guy wasn't just exaggerating a little bit?

01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:41.360
No, just because of the price it cost to develop this stuff.

01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:47.400
It's got to sell that many units in order to make up its production costs.

01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:51.200
But anyway, that might be worldwide.

01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:55.280
I don't know, if it's worldwide I could see that it could probably do that.

01:12:55.280 --> 01:12:57.820
It will sell a million units probably.

01:12:57.820 --> 01:13:02.360
But then again, also people wanting to draw that conclusion, well if they can't sell a

01:13:02.360 --> 01:13:07.280
million units on the Playstation 3, maybe if they developed it for the Xbox 360 as well

01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:12.940
they could sell a million units and whatever.

01:13:12.940 --> 01:13:15.400
Maybe it will come out on the Xbox 360 someday.

01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:20.520
Alright, well PC gamers are going to be very happy to hear, especially those that are into

01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:25.280
first person shooters blended with RPGs, that Deus Ex is getting another sequel.

01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:28.760
Deus Ex 3 is coming out from Eidos.

01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:32.080
This was announced when they were talking about their newest studio in Montreal, which

01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:34.640
opened up a little earlier this year.

01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:41.480
The studio hopes to expand about 350 people in the year 2009, and they just recently have

01:13:41.480 --> 01:13:42.680
started development on the game.

01:13:42.680 --> 01:13:46.960
It just passed proof of concept stage, Deus Ex 3.

01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:49.000
We will see what develops on this game.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.680
I'm sure lots of people are foaming at the mouth because I know this is a very popular

01:13:51.680 --> 01:13:55.760
game on the PC.

01:13:55.760 --> 01:13:59.480
Here's a strange rumor that's coming from a very unusual source.

01:13:59.480 --> 01:14:05.520
The unofficial Artie Lang site, you might know him from the Howard Stern show.

01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:11.600
Apparently Lang will be voicing the role of a character named Big Al in an upcoming Leisure

01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:17.160
Suit Larry game, which I think is pretty cool that they are making another Leisure Suit

01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:20.480
Larry game.

01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:25.260
That's a very interesting way that they found out that a new game is coming.

01:14:25.260 --> 01:14:31.440
No word on when it's coming or what it's going to be, but interesting.

01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:37.920
Yeah, I don't think a new Leisure Suit Larry game is going to really be that impressive,

01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:38.920
to be honest.

01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:39.920
Nah, the last one wasn't.

01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:40.920
Alright.

01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:49.600
Well, IGN has recently published their list of the OMG Top 100 Games of All Time list,

01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:50.600
which it seems like...

01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:52.060
Don't we get a list like this every couple of years?

01:14:52.060 --> 01:14:53.060
Every year.

01:14:53.060 --> 01:14:57.440
Here's the reason why I actually wanted to bring it up, is that I got to say, I think

01:14:57.440 --> 01:15:00.000
the list isn't that bad, all things considered.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:04.360
I know I've given corporate websites a hard time in the past, but all things considered,

01:15:04.360 --> 01:15:09.440
I actually think this list is not too far different from what my list might look like

01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:11.160
of the top games of all time.

01:15:11.160 --> 01:15:12.160
I'll just run down.

01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:15.640
Obviously, I don't have time to read all 100, but let's recap maybe the top 20 real quick.

01:15:15.640 --> 01:15:19.080
I'll breeze through the bottom 10, and I'll go over the top 10.

01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:21.680
Metal Gear Solid was number 20.

01:15:21.680 --> 01:15:23.880
Doom was number 19.

01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:25.440
Chrono Trigger was number 18.

01:15:25.440 --> 01:15:26.440
Boo!

01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:27.440
It should be number 1.

01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:33.360
17 was Super Mario World, 16 was Shadow of the Colossus, 15 was Castlevania Symphony

01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:41.740
of the Night, 14 was Pirates by Sid Meier, 13 was Ms. Pac-Man, 12 was Star Wars TIE Fighter.

01:15:41.740 --> 01:15:43.840
I like that this list included PC games, too.

01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:44.840
11 was StarCraft.

01:15:44.840 --> 01:15:46.500
Alright, then here's the top 10.

01:15:46.500 --> 01:15:53.360
Resident Evil 4 was number 10 on the GameCube, and obviously that game got a lot of game

01:15:53.360 --> 01:15:56.840
of the year accolades when it came out, and it is a pretty great game.

01:15:56.840 --> 01:16:04.040
Final Fantasy III or VI by the Japanese scale was the number 9 game of all time, which I

01:16:04.040 --> 01:16:07.720
believe is the highest ranking Final Fantasy game on the list, so Final Fantasy VII was

01:16:07.720 --> 01:16:12.460
not in the top 10, which I'm sure makes fanboys mad, but I think that's okay.

01:16:12.460 --> 01:16:17.040
Number 8 was The Legend of Zelda, A Link to the Past.

01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:22.420
Number 7 was Super Metroid, which would probably be my number 1, honestly.

01:16:22.420 --> 01:16:25.320
Number 6 was Half-Life 2.

01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:30.280
Number 5 was Super Mario 64, which a lot of people would probably put as their number

01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:33.300
1, so it's kind of interesting that there's still some more games to go here.

01:16:33.300 --> 01:16:35.640
Number 4 is The Legend of Zelda, Ocarina of Time.

01:16:35.640 --> 01:16:38.800
So that's two Zeldas in the top 10?

01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:41.680
Well, you know, the Zelda games are great games.

01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:42.680
We're just confirming.

01:16:42.680 --> 01:16:45.840
Yeah, no, it's two Zelda games in the top 10 so far.

01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:48.920
Number 3 is Civilization II.

01:16:48.920 --> 01:16:52.880
God bless them for remembering the Civilization series, because it is a great series.

01:16:52.880 --> 01:16:55.480
It does deserve to be that high on the list.

01:16:55.480 --> 01:16:58.380
Although I would have put the original Civilization, but that's just me.

01:16:58.380 --> 01:16:59.640
Number 2 is Tetris.

01:16:59.640 --> 01:17:00.640
Tetris.

01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:01.760
Hmm, what's number 1?

01:17:01.760 --> 01:17:02.760
What do you think number 1?

01:17:02.760 --> 01:17:05.000
The number 1 greatest game of all time?

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.360
Pac-Man?

01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:12.600
Super Mario Bros. on the NES, the very first original Super Mario Bros. game.

01:17:12.600 --> 01:17:17.280
That does make a lot of sense, because who doesn't remember Super Mario Bros.?

01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:21.240
If you played the theme for somebody, who doesn't know that theme and what that is?

01:17:21.240 --> 01:17:23.560
Yeah, Mario is part of pop culture.

01:17:23.560 --> 01:17:27.800
People know who Mario is, so it makes a lot of sense.

01:17:27.800 --> 01:17:29.280
And it was a pretty good game at the time.

01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:30.280
Well, yeah.

01:17:30.280 --> 01:17:31.280
So there you go.

01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:32.280
Still is.

01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:34.200
Alright, well, there's a different website.

01:17:34.200 --> 01:17:38.720
I also happen to be affiliated with IGN, doing another Top 10 list.

01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:45.400
This of course is AskMen's Top 10 Hottest Women in Tech.

01:17:45.400 --> 01:17:48.380
We'll run down this list here real quick, too.

01:17:48.380 --> 01:17:54.040
Number 10, Wendy Chang, who apparently is a...

01:17:54.040 --> 01:17:55.040
Let's see here.

01:17:55.040 --> 01:17:56.040
Don't know her.

01:17:56.040 --> 01:17:57.040
Don't know her.

01:17:57.040 --> 01:18:04.040
She apparently does vidcasts on a network, clicknetwork.tv.

01:18:04.040 --> 01:18:05.200
But she has big boobies.

01:18:05.200 --> 01:18:06.200
So that's fine.

01:18:06.200 --> 01:18:07.200
And she's Asian.

01:18:07.200 --> 01:18:08.880
So, two points there.

01:18:08.880 --> 01:18:10.840
Rise Princess has big boobies, and she's Asian.

01:18:10.840 --> 01:18:11.840
Oh, stop it.

01:18:11.840 --> 01:18:12.840
Anyways.

01:18:12.840 --> 01:18:15.280
I don't do my own video games, though.

01:18:15.280 --> 01:18:28.160
Let's see, Blair Butler, who is a stand-up comedian, and she's on X-Play, or she's a

01:18:28.160 --> 01:18:30.160
writer on X-Play.

01:18:30.160 --> 01:18:39.320
And she also has a reoccurring bit and tell geek out that appears on G4's website.

01:18:39.320 --> 01:18:42.280
All these people G4 people, no.

01:18:42.280 --> 01:18:46.120
Kristen Holt, she was a Dallas Cowboy...

01:18:46.120 --> 01:18:47.440
No, she was on American Idol.

01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:49.120
Yes, she was on American Idol.

01:18:49.120 --> 01:18:50.120
I've heard of her.

01:18:50.120 --> 01:18:56.400
She was also a Dallas Cowboy's cheerleader, and now she's the host of G4's Cheat.

01:18:56.400 --> 01:18:57.560
Wow.

01:18:57.560 --> 01:19:04.440
And she also hosts a new game called Shout About Television.

01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:07.320
And she's working also as a tech reporter on Attack of the Shout.

01:19:07.320 --> 01:19:13.000
Some might call this podcast Shout About Video Games, especially when Loki reviews things.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:14.800
Hey, enough back talk.

01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:17.400
That was a good one, Rahab.

01:19:17.400 --> 01:19:23.640
Anyways, Amanda Cogdon, I don't know her either.

01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:28.360
She apparently has a gig on Rocketboom, a daily video blog.

01:19:28.360 --> 01:19:29.760
Wow.

01:19:29.760 --> 01:19:31.080
Whatever.

01:19:31.080 --> 01:19:38.920
Anyways, Veronica Belmont, not related, no relation to Simon Belmont.

01:19:38.920 --> 01:19:41.880
Boring, then I don't give a shit about her.

01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:43.260
Never heard of her.

01:19:43.260 --> 01:19:50.960
She has, I guess, she's acted as a producer and sound engineer for CNET's Buzz Out Loud

01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:53.680
podcast.

01:19:53.680 --> 01:19:55.200
Let's move it a little faster, Loki.

01:19:55.200 --> 01:19:56.200
Sorry.

01:19:56.200 --> 01:19:57.200
Any guesses?

01:19:57.200 --> 01:19:58.200
Number one, Morgan Webb?

01:19:58.200 --> 01:19:59.200
No, this is not number one.

01:19:59.200 --> 01:20:00.880
Actually, here, I'll just skip to number one.

01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:03.160
We'll do the top three here real quick.

01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:04.160
Thank you.

01:20:04.160 --> 01:20:09.600
Anyways, number three, Jessica Chobot.

01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:10.600
She's the one that licked the PSP, right?

01:20:10.600 --> 01:20:12.640
She's the one that licked the PSP, and she's also...

01:20:12.640 --> 01:20:13.640
Okay, have her to her.

01:20:13.640 --> 01:20:14.640
Who is she?

01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:15.640
She's also...

01:20:15.640 --> 01:20:16.640
She was Friday Inn.

01:20:16.640 --> 01:20:23.120
She was a model, and she does a lot of stuff on IGN, including their on the street stuff,

01:20:23.120 --> 01:20:26.880
and she does the IGN Weekly and all that kind of crap.

01:20:26.880 --> 01:20:27.880
Number two is Morgan Webb.

01:20:27.880 --> 01:20:32.380
And only IGN could hire a woman to walk the streets and get paid for it.

01:20:32.380 --> 01:20:33.600
That's what women do naturally.

01:20:33.600 --> 01:20:36.000
They're so good at it.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:39.920
Morgan Webb, of course, she's on X-Play, and we all know who she is.

01:20:39.920 --> 01:20:41.100
She's the number one, then.

01:20:41.100 --> 01:20:45.840
Number one is Amber McArthur, and apparently she's on...

01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:46.840
I've never heard of her.

01:20:46.840 --> 01:20:50.560
She's on G4's Tech2Be Canada's Call for Help show.

01:20:50.560 --> 01:20:53.000
Okay, I have to see what she looks like.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:54.000
She's...

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:55.000
No.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:56.000
I want to see if she's pretty.

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:57.000
That's stand out.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:58.000
I mean, she's cute, but...

01:20:58.000 --> 01:20:59.000
She's very plain.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.240
You know who she looks like?

01:21:01.240 --> 01:21:03.240
What the hell was her name from Melrose Place?

01:21:03.240 --> 01:21:04.240
Was it Melrose?

01:21:04.240 --> 01:21:05.240
Heather Locklear?

01:21:05.240 --> 01:21:06.240
No.

01:21:06.240 --> 01:21:07.240
Oh.

01:21:07.240 --> 01:21:08.240
So maybe it was...

01:21:08.240 --> 01:21:09.240
Was it Melrose Place?

01:21:09.240 --> 01:21:10.240
Come on, Courtney?

01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:11.240
I know who you're talking about.

01:21:11.240 --> 01:21:12.240
Courtney, yeah.

01:21:12.240 --> 01:21:13.240
She was...

01:21:13.240 --> 01:21:14.240
I don't know.

01:21:14.240 --> 01:21:15.240
I don't know about her.

01:21:15.240 --> 01:21:16.240
I don't know who she looks like.

01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:17.240
Yes, her.

01:21:17.240 --> 01:21:19.640
I don't fucking remember, but she looks exactly like her.

01:21:19.640 --> 01:21:20.640
She's...

01:21:20.640 --> 01:21:23.680
The very plain looking one on Ally McBeal, too.

01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:31.560
Yes, and also Ally McBeal, the character, but wow, whoop-dee-doo.

01:21:31.560 --> 01:21:36.640
But hey, I mean, seriously, why are they doing a top ten list?

01:21:36.640 --> 01:21:37.920
Stop doing top ten lists, people.

01:21:37.920 --> 01:21:39.720
People that nobody knows or cares about.

01:21:39.720 --> 01:21:42.120
The chat room is naming some other people.

01:21:42.120 --> 01:21:45.880
Miranda Cosgrove says Sakura Max, don't know who that is.

01:21:45.880 --> 01:21:49.040
Olivia Munn says DJ Dark Knight.

01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:50.960
Don't know who that is.

01:21:50.960 --> 01:21:52.040
She's on Attack of the Show, right?

01:21:52.040 --> 01:21:53.040
Diane Miyazoda.

01:21:53.040 --> 01:21:54.040
Oh.

01:21:54.040 --> 01:21:55.040
Yeah.

01:21:55.040 --> 01:21:56.040
That's what Son of Dad says.

01:21:56.040 --> 01:21:57.040
Diane Miyazoda.

01:21:57.040 --> 01:22:02.240
She doesn't do Cheetah anymore, though, or not Cheetah, Filter.

01:22:02.240 --> 01:22:03.240
She does...

01:22:03.240 --> 01:22:05.920
She actually does some, like, I want to see, like a...

01:22:05.920 --> 01:22:06.920
Rama says that's her name.

01:22:06.920 --> 01:22:07.920
Courtney Thorne-Smith.

01:22:07.920 --> 01:22:09.280
Courtney Thorne-Smith.

01:22:09.280 --> 01:22:10.280
That's what it is.

01:22:10.280 --> 01:22:15.440
It's like a... was it a makeover show or something like that, like for kids or something?

01:22:15.440 --> 01:22:16.440
It's like a...

01:22:16.440 --> 01:22:17.440
It's not...

01:22:17.440 --> 01:22:18.440
Makeover for kids.

01:22:18.440 --> 01:22:20.140
It's not for kids.

01:22:20.140 --> 01:22:21.140
It's like...

01:22:21.140 --> 01:22:23.680
Damn, my kid is ugly, Diane.

01:22:23.680 --> 01:22:26.520
Not like that, like a room makeover.

01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:28.760
It's like, you know, trading spaces, but for kids.

01:22:28.760 --> 01:22:30.480
Oh, I know what you're talking about.

01:22:30.480 --> 01:22:31.480
I've seen that before.

01:22:31.480 --> 01:22:32.480
So...

01:22:32.480 --> 01:22:34.560
No, it's not a makeover.

01:22:34.560 --> 01:22:35.560
You're too fat, Timmy.

01:22:35.560 --> 01:22:36.560
You're gonna get liposuction.

01:22:36.560 --> 01:22:39.040
Well, haven't you ever seen that store at the mall?

01:22:39.040 --> 01:22:40.760
What's it called, the Libby Loo or whatever?

01:22:40.760 --> 01:22:41.760
Like it...

01:22:41.760 --> 01:22:42.760
That's what...

01:22:42.760 --> 01:22:44.480
It's like a makeover for little seven-year-old girls store.

01:22:44.480 --> 01:22:47.080
And then, like, it's like a place where girls are supposed to have, like, their birthday

01:22:47.080 --> 01:22:49.120
parties and stuff, and they'll get...

01:22:49.120 --> 01:22:53.060
They'll all get makeovers together, and then, like, I swear to God, one day we were walking

01:22:53.060 --> 01:22:54.060
by there.

01:22:54.060 --> 01:22:58.000
I think it was Shane and I were at the mall, walking by there, and the little seven-year-old

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:03.240
girls were putting on a little dance routine that they'd learn, and oh my God, they look

01:23:03.240 --> 01:23:04.240
like little sluts.

01:23:04.240 --> 01:23:08.400
I mean, this is a horrible thing to say about seven-year-olds, but who would let their seven-year-old

01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:09.400
learn these type of dances?

01:23:09.400 --> 01:23:11.440
I mean, they looked like they were training to become strippers.

01:23:11.440 --> 01:23:14.720
It was horrible.

01:23:14.720 --> 01:23:15.720
And I think...

01:23:15.720 --> 01:23:18.560
I don't remember who it was that said it, but somebody that I was with said something

01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:21.960
about like, wow, they look like a bunch of little sluts, and one of the kids' parents

01:23:21.960 --> 01:23:22.960
was right there.

01:23:22.960 --> 01:23:23.960
And they're like...

01:23:23.960 --> 01:23:29.120
They turn around, and they're like, yes, that's what we wanted.

01:23:29.120 --> 01:23:30.760
Mission accomplished.

01:23:30.760 --> 01:23:31.760
Anyhow.

01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:38.560
Let's go ahead and move on with some other news, such as Super Smash Brothers.

01:23:38.560 --> 01:23:40.920
We were talking about the Wii earlier in the show.

01:23:40.920 --> 01:23:45.400
Super Smash Brothers Brawl, just the news does not stop about Super Smash Brothers Brawl.

01:23:45.400 --> 01:23:50.520
And what's pretty awesome is that some of the old stages from Melee are going to return

01:23:50.520 --> 01:23:52.040
in Super Smash Brothers Brawl.

01:23:52.040 --> 01:23:56.480
So like the Zelda II temple is coming back.

01:23:56.480 --> 01:24:00.680
But what they did is they actually, I think they like combined two stages to make this

01:24:00.680 --> 01:24:01.680
stage.

01:24:01.680 --> 01:24:02.680
Is that better?

01:24:02.680 --> 01:24:05.040
No, that looks like the stage.

01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:06.640
To me, that was a full stage.

01:24:06.640 --> 01:24:15.640
Let me actually look at the original post here on the dojo about what it is.

01:24:15.640 --> 01:24:17.200
Oh no, I guess it is the same stage.

01:24:17.200 --> 01:24:18.440
Yeah, it looks exactly the same.

01:24:18.440 --> 01:24:23.640
And they also posted the music from the stage there on the website.

01:24:23.640 --> 01:24:28.280
That's a little bit of a remix.

01:24:28.280 --> 01:24:29.880
Very cool.

01:24:29.880 --> 01:24:33.320
That's on the SmashBrothers.com website.

01:24:33.320 --> 01:24:34.320
Check that out.

01:24:34.320 --> 01:24:36.760
Alright, well gosh, part A is running long tonight.

01:24:36.760 --> 01:24:38.160
We're almost at an hour and a half.

01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:42.880
But we want to go ahead and close out part A here, the way we always do, by paying tribute

01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:46.200
to the classic games of yesteryear.

01:24:46.200 --> 01:24:49.600
And Dark Soccer is not here tonight to do the classic game of the week, but we've been

01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:50.600
filling in.

01:24:50.600 --> 01:24:53.440
Last week I picked a game, Equinox, if you forgot.

01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:58.440
And this week, Loki's going to pick a game for us as his classic game of the week.

01:24:58.440 --> 01:25:05.800
Yes, classic game, I was torn on what I should pick.

01:25:05.800 --> 01:25:08.160
Almost picked Gals Pamming.

01:25:08.160 --> 01:25:12.540
But no, we'll save that for another episode when she's gone as well.

01:25:12.540 --> 01:25:18.800
This week I decided to pick a wonderful game that I loved on the Super Nintendo and was

01:25:18.800 --> 01:25:20.760
also on the Genesis as well.

01:25:20.760 --> 01:25:24.920
It's a game called Zombies Ate My Neighbors.

01:25:24.920 --> 01:25:26.880
And it's absolutely awesome.

01:25:26.880 --> 01:25:27.880
It's very cheesy.

01:25:27.880 --> 01:25:33.440
It's kind of like a spoof on a bunch of horror films from the 1950s and 60s.

01:25:33.440 --> 01:25:38.520
It was made by LucasArts, actually published by Konami.

01:25:38.520 --> 01:25:41.160
And definitely a game you should check out.

01:25:41.160 --> 01:25:46.920
I wish it would come out on virtual consoles so we can play it again.

01:25:46.920 --> 01:25:50.800
But tons and tons and tons of different levels you can play.

01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:58.320
They have like squirt guns, grenades, all sorts of things you can fight.

01:25:58.320 --> 01:26:01.480
Things from giant babies to UFOs, zombies.

01:26:01.480 --> 01:26:02.480
You name it.

01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:04.400
It's an awesome game.

01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:06.120
Really fun.

01:26:06.120 --> 01:26:07.640
I've actually never played this game.

01:26:07.640 --> 01:26:08.640
No, I really have.

01:26:08.640 --> 01:26:11.000
This is one of those games I just kind of missed.

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
You need to go do this.

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
Well then that's why they need to put it out on virtual console.

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:19.760
Yeah, you basically run through the stages trying to rescue people and stuff and collect

01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:24.920
weapons and then sometimes they'll have you fight different things.

01:26:24.920 --> 01:26:27.640
And each one of the stages is titled after a movie.

01:26:27.640 --> 01:26:28.640
It's kind of like spoofed.

01:26:28.640 --> 01:26:33.680
So they'll have a bunch that are like Night of the Living Dead and stuff like that.

01:26:33.680 --> 01:26:34.680
That's cool.

01:26:34.680 --> 01:26:35.680
He's freezing the zombies in this one.

01:26:35.680 --> 01:26:40.840
Yeah, it might sound like it's kind of a generic game but it's really stylized and it's like

01:26:40.840 --> 01:26:41.840
really fun.

01:26:41.840 --> 01:26:42.840
You really just have to play it.

01:26:42.840 --> 01:26:43.840
It's really interesting.

01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:48.080
I always hear folks talking about this game but I've never really seen it in action so

01:26:48.080 --> 01:26:50.480
there's a little cheerleader.

01:26:50.480 --> 01:26:52.560
So by running over them they're saving them or something?

01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:53.560
Yeah.

01:26:53.560 --> 01:26:54.840
Oh, I think I remember seeing something like this.

01:26:54.840 --> 01:26:57.440
He bounces on a trampoline to get over the hedge, right?

01:26:57.440 --> 01:26:58.440
Yep.

01:26:58.440 --> 01:26:59.440
Or he can...

01:26:59.440 --> 01:27:00.440
Can he...

01:27:00.440 --> 01:27:02.440
Oh yeah, he's saving that guy.

01:27:02.440 --> 01:27:03.440
Interesting.

01:27:03.440 --> 01:27:05.440
Oh, somebody else is bouncing on a trampoline.

01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:07.440
Oh, that's kind of neat.

01:27:07.440 --> 01:27:08.440
Alright, pretty cool.

01:27:08.440 --> 01:27:11.360
Zombies Ate My Neighbors, your classic video game of the week.

01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:14.040
Thank you very much, Loki.

01:27:14.040 --> 01:27:15.040
Good job.

01:27:15.040 --> 01:27:16.040
You're welcome.

01:27:16.040 --> 01:27:20.320
Well, Loki, you sound like you've got a makeover.

01:27:20.320 --> 01:27:24.920
Alright, anyhow, let's use this opportunity to take a little break and when we come back,

01:27:24.920 --> 01:27:26.640
plenty more gaming news.

01:27:26.640 --> 01:27:28.920
We have Xbox news we haven't even touched.

01:27:28.920 --> 01:27:30.840
Xbox has a new dashboard update coming out soon.

01:27:30.840 --> 01:27:34.240
We've got all the details when we come back from this little break.

01:27:34.240 --> 01:27:35.240

01:27:35.240 --> 01:27:36.640
Now you touched it.

01:27:36.640 --> 01:27:41.960
Well, we'll get our hands real dirty with it when we come back, especially you and naughty

01:27:41.960 --> 01:27:42.960
Rice Princess.

01:27:42.960 --> 01:27:43.960
Yeah, because it's a piece of crap.

01:27:43.960 --> 01:27:44.960
Alright.

01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:48.040
The update for the Xbox continues all segment long.

01:27:48.040 --> 01:27:50.480
